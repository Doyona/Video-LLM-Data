Tell you the true about the end of humanity COVID hit the world China in dark side of the moon the sailor speaks too soon and we wait for something in summer dark
Love this! Take me back to the summer of 2001.
so glad they only took the good drugs this time and got back to form. beautiful boys.
Please dont close my hobby FISHING
What means " black summer"   ????❤
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
I love this song ❤
1:26 Behind the Sun mentioned?
2:14 i remember the first time hearing that part of the guitar solo and getting goosebumps, like, man, John is really back with the band

Listening to this in headphones is a treat
Siempre vuelvo a esta canción, no importa que año sea❤
Mi friends said that I m like person of 60 years becouse you are the best band of the world. But I have only 11 years
Sempre que ouço esta música.... que timbre, Sr. Franciscante , que banda ,yours are Amazing!!!!
I was 8 year old, in 1992, but still love Them !!!!
Chad manda muito bem na bateria ❤
2060 anyone?
so we have will ferrel on drums, joe exotic on vocals and the kid from the thornberries playing bass?
This talent is unmatched. You can tell that they love their craft 💯💪🏾
I was visiting Hawaii when this song came out. It was played on the radio so many times... and now, it's taken me 3 years to like it again
Man, banging 19 year old groupies really keeps you young.
RHCP forever ❤❤❤
One of the best songs to listen to while stoned no joke its been on repeat for years
A lazy rain am i

I want a new friend ❤
Red Hot 💪👍
#flea. 🙈🙈🙈 It's been a long time since we had new CHILI friends! It was the first SAXJAM we had to! Though she drives us round the bend! We couldn't fathom how or why - BUT THE JAM WENT SUPER NOVA WHEN  THAT FUCKEN SAXOFUCKWIT GOT #MIKEPatton TO ATTEND YEAH ‼️  BEST JAM WE EVER HAD -  YOU COULD TOUCH IT! FEEL IT! WAG IT IN HER FACE!    SOLOS SO FUCKEN EPIC- ROCK'N'ROLL FROM OUTTA SPACE MOTHERFUCKERS-  (I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY BUT-) 😁😁😁💙💜💙💙🤪  ("SHUT AAAAAAARP ‼️ FUCK OFF!!!")  💋💋💋💋
Killer jam
Que c est bon !!! Je vibre toujours !!! Merciiii quoi de mieux !!! 😝😝🤘🤘
Amazing! ✨🎆
They've taken all my stuff from the dimension, I said I was created. and then they were born, then I lost. Sepērētë without torture and me and Kristy no al on it wasn't me that said I don't deserve soul power, so why did he do this?
John = RHCP
Man I dont care what Chili Pepers album it is EVERY album has at least a few REALLY REALLY GOOD SONGS on it then you get albums like califorinacation that has every song on it that is GOOD.. BUt this does not disappoint .. I love this song!! Good Job guys .. rock on !!!
They look unaffected by time....😮
SOY PEPPERS , O SOMOS ¡¡¡¡¡   COLORES Y     VOS ¡¡¡¡
I miss Josh. But it’s good to have John back.
We need a RHCP X Primus Colab!!! Dreams/Goals?!
kako su omatorili slusao sam ih u osnovnoj skoli jbt i ja sam mator :D hahaha
God I wish it was just an instrumental I can't stand Anthony,  but the music is wonderful
This is the PROOF, that Frusciante IS the sound of RHCP.
Esse clipe dos caras do Red Hot Chili Peppers , é maravilhoso e diz muita coisa sobre vários temas  verdadeiros!
My life is a Black Summer. And that’s okay now – because I accepted it today. All the darkness and all the light. This song will always remind me of that. 🖤
2080 anyone
❤❤❤❤
So nice of Keanu Reeves & Will Ferrel to fill in on the drums & guitar for this song
Que grande Nacho Malcorra, no sabia que cantaba.
Parabéns RHCP vcs são bons de maís.
When did will farrell start playing drums
Thisis what i want the kids 5to learn threw videos and bools , it a life time of rough house ing
Recuerdo haber gritado como una prra cuando vi a John de regreso
along with depeche mode and a very happy few others, one of those bands that never really lost track and keeps maintaining their success and recognizable unique style
🤘🏻
C'mon let's keep the comments alive on this one. Good Song.
How did I find a new rhcp song in 2025!!!!¡
I am listening every morning to work hard life
https://youtu.be/34KVupmrpEs?si=s2rPo3kaK-dwUHOq
2025 almost 2026!
John will be remembered as one the best guitarist of all time. Flea is already top 2!  Just an amazing group.
Fuck yea!
🌑🥷🌇
There's something specific I love about each album, and with Unlimited Love it's undoubtedly the sound of John's guitar. It's so present, and larger than life sounding in a way that it never has been before. Not even on SA. And also Anthony's vocals are so beautiful on these songs. Like Flea said, "I'm so proud of Anthony, he's sounding better than he's ever sounded. He just keeps getting better."
Damm 3 years ago 😮
Yo también espero q se terminó unos meses negros
one problem gone another rise
They definitely made this song based on another song of theirs, I recognize this song from somewhere, you know that feeling of "wait, I've heard this before!" I just don't know where, but I have.
А можно ещё? )))
Masterpiece
Arriveranno altri droni sulla 🇵🇱 Polonia. Vedrete che ci siamo quasi.

Keanu in the guitar and Will Farrell on the drums is a crazy band 😂
yoooo this son is very cool with the solos the lyrics 100/100
Amazing Band ❤🎉😊
I miss Josh so much. Biggest mistake to give him away.
Please, Bros…Just hit the “Группа крови»🫶🫶🫶
RHCP is an emotion 😔🔥
Badges guitar solo!
Experts do more with less.
🥶☠️
As long as John's here the earth's still turning
я люблю вас пацаны
3001 anyone
Does Kiedis sound Irish in this song? 😂 Love this band
Melhor guitarra ótimo som
Q PASADA!!!!. ESPECTACULAR INTRO RHCP❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🖤
When death claims me I’ll have dark smile summer can’t hurt me anymore
The beginning of Chad’s drum intro is just everything to me. Damn, he’s awesome!
A piece of art from these guys that should have gotten way more air play.   A beautiful song.
eu amo red hot
They never get bad
Dutch van der linde is back
My goodness... The peppers music has given my ears a cavity over and over 🎉🥰💛
I missed John Frusciante Josh didn't fit in the band.
RHCP 🙌🏼🦅🦅🦅
I think 2025 is a black summer @ least 4 me ! Even the weather is crappy...
Anyone watching 2025-2026?
Saw the Chili Peppers with Frusciante--blew my mind away
Amazing!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Iggy Pop is looking great 👌🏾🤠
Amazing how simple it is yet no one did it. Chili peppers are 1st!
John is not only a guitar hero but the best male vocalist ever existed. Much respect!
1985 in a mk2 escort with twin40s and a Kent fast road camshaft anyone?!?!
After Stadium Arcadium and all the time John was gone , when there was a release of the opening riff to this song I can't describe the feeling.
The world is a  more greener!
3099 now is here⚓️
The guitar work here is VERY Hendrix-y. Fantastic song
Anthony's haircut resembles the haircut of Russian gangsters from the 1990s
3980 anyone? 🎉
Uau! Que clip, que performance...cada vez melhor... É maturidade chegando e em plena forma, parabéns ❤ Anthony, Jhon Frusciante, Flea e Chad Smith ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
RHCPeppers,como vinho cada vez melhor ❤
2025 🇨🇴 Red Hot Chillie Peppers
Anthony talking with a weird accent and doing tai chi in the desert is the greatest thing i've ever seen
114514 anyone
This is so fucking good. I feel 14 again.
John Wick the guitar player 😎
Feels weird to see a high quality Chili Peppers song 😂
Really beautiful
Best music of Red hot chili peppers
Thank you, so come is you are🍻frwl
These guys can probably get alzheimers and still sound the same. That's a very very good thing. I doubt we'd even know to be honest, their lyrics have never made sense but the music has always been so amazing and still is so
00:17  - tony keedas looks up at heavens  above and flashes devil horns  with right hand hes thanked satan at  an  mtv awards show in 90s  most of RCHP music is complete garbage. i will say thou,  flea is an incredible/ natural bassist.  the earth is flat yahshua is lord
The peppers still got it
hes still using that fender stratocaster
😎😎😎😎🙉🙉🙉🙉💯💯💯
Sonny
Парни, я сижу сейчас, летом 25, бухаю в гараже и в голос ору вашу песню. Вряд ли вы это прочтёте, ну да и по хер. Лайк би лайк!
Aún me emociono cuando el vídeo llega a los 46 segundos 🥲
Black Summer
😎😎😎😘
yup here and alive in 25'
Super. ❤
This song should've used in the ending credits of The Black Phone.
Good
monstro hed🍁✌️
Sound is incredible for a live concert tone, sound, vocals are absolutely great
Catch a red roogo ana rock uluroo cathulaloo
Great band but one of the biggest disappoitment in a live concert. I've seen them at the Leeds festival, after 3 songs was clear that they were doing their 9 to 5 and did not want to be there, we switched stage and went to see Jack Garratt which gave a sublime performance.
Oh yes! I still have Unlimited Love for Unlimited Love 2025!❤
RHCP for ever 😢
Vivo enamorada de AK 😍🤭
RHCP forever
0:49 Keanu Reaves everybody i didnt kne he was on the band
PLEASE
Rock legend
Anthony adopt me
2032 Anyone? 😂
I must admit, I thought Unlimited Love was a bit of a mess when it was first released but after 3 years,  its grown on me. Its a great ride.
2025 con buena musica viva los red hot
Great to see Will Ferrel still kicking it!
This is ritual.
they just saying the truth

BUT THE PERFORMACES THIS BAND MAKES OF THIS SONG, I CANNOT HARMONIZE, TRY TO GET THE RIGHT PITCH AND MAYBE ILL GO TO ONE OF THE CONCERTS
2025 anyone?
<<<<~~~~~ check it rockers
1992 anyone?
Is it just me or Chad's playing Californication's main groove?
3099 anyone?
só eu que achei esse cabelo e bigode do Anthony meio mais ou menos demais?
Are❤
Pieza 👌
❤ vengan a Perú 🇵🇪😁✨🥰🙌
Reminds me of a dying puppie.  ❤
It grows 😊❤
이 노래 너무 좋다
1967 anyone
I got to know red hot chili peppers cus of my bro rip bro 🙏 cus of you I love this band
the arse hole thinks hes going to move to mars and live forever. what a dick.
Is the solo at 2:00 on the neck or bridge pickup? He has it on the bridge but YouTubers covering this song use the neck pickup. It does sound like a neck pickup but it’s sorta brighter but not bridge bright hm
kick-ass song!!!!!!
Música linda , mesmo tema da  Under The brigde ,Solidão Californiana
Favorite song of my life. Seriously. F*CKIN BEST SONG EVER!!!!
Thank q youtube for recommending this again today 😊😊
Please do more reggae songs because I love reggae song! So can you make reggae songs? Idę you mąkę more reggae songs you are the best!!!
Damn. They even got Will to play the drums for them...
It was always going to happen, John’s return. It was inevitable. But it didn’t have to be this good. The Peppers ARE BACK.
Anthony killed this.
This song is amazing.
For me one of the greatest songs in the history of music
John: “Im gonna do good for my first song back with the band.”  Anthony: “mAmmA iM a PiRate🏴‍☠️🤓”

D'ya think John Frusciante likes Jimi Hendrix ?
Many failed to recognize this ode to a BLACK covid summer...
One of my all-time faves of their's.
Anthony my Summer is here. Freedom to me means harmony  peace and tranquility. Not being placed in a 3rd party situation and get told that she was doing shady things with ex friends.That is why I can't make a friend around here cos the trust has gone completely. Also I would of done good by your next of kin and my plan was to eventually make money some kind of way. Black summer has ended Anthony Love from Babyx ❤
One and only

The Mountain Dew green one is sick
Another Black Summer without You babe        She's not dead, But she is to me.
Why is everyone obsessed with Phil's skin color?? It's the music that's important 🤘
3 years late on this song but damnnnnnnn feels so damn goooooood
Amazing 🤩🤩🤩
Still Rocks! Classic sound with Frusciante! ✌️😊
Please take time to help children that want to express suicidal thoughts. I do not speak for the peppers but life is short.  We have to love and care. ❤❤❤
Absolute John wick

This is Red hot fkn peppers
❤❤💕💕😍🌅🌅
Fly away on my zephyr I feel it more than ever
I've always loved RCHP, since I was young enough to be slightly scared of the "Give it Away" music video. They were one of the three bands I acquired a tape for at six years old, and I played those tapes over and over and over (BloodSugarSexMagik, 40 Oz to Freedom, and Onyx) I just realized during this song - John Frusciante is definitely my favorite guitar player. You always can tell it's him playing, and he can take one note and just make it sing. Wanna hear a crazy good song? Listen to his instrumental song called "Murderers"
Nice cookie duster
this is going to apply to this summer in all the worst ways possible.
3 years already? Maaaan... just like their other songs this one hasn't lost any charm. ❤ RHCP always had that special sound.
thats why its my favorite song ❤
i litteraly harmonise with the singer at the first line
Slow mo Michael Jackson moves at the beginning of the video….. sold!
Love peace and music ❤
This song is like the CORE of RHCP. Simply it hit me back in callifornication album time in the 90s
2:50　I like it here!!!!! Shockwave in the ear 😄
They’re slipping
RHCP forever ✨🤘✨
Yeah
je l'ai joué pour un concert a la batterie c'était incroyable que de souvenir
Thanks for this guitar solo ❤
When i was in summer vacancy lonely on the beach i listen this song and re-think to the nostalgia of my past summer and years
Мне одному показалось что где то проскакивает глобал диджей сан франциско?
A fucking masterpiece
Glad to see they are still making music. Sounds good. 🙂
Desde Chile🇨🇱 Que esta música sea inmortal🤘
hermoso tema me reconforta en el alma
I love this men😊
❤
Antwan the Swan! And Flea! Been following these guys from the beginning! Fresh and original and kick ass some of LA's finest! Never boring and always explosive! ICONIC  🎸 😎
!@#$ING AWESOME \,,/...
I became a fan of the Chili's when i heard love rollercoaster in beavis and butthead do america
I wish they were all shirtless in the music video😊
You MotherFuckers know how to KICK ASS💜🔥 I Love you guys so much. Been 🤘 with y'all from the Start. God Bless keep on 🤘
Slow cheetah revisited chorus

Best band in the world. TY RHCP. 🫶🏽💯THE HZA WUZ HERE
The opening vocals of this song are similar to A Hard's night's guitar solo melody.
i miss josh
This is the best thing that has come out in a long time
Im still here
The Very beautiful song, in 2025 and FOREVER!! ❤️🙌🙌
Time really flies..... It just doesn't seem like it's been so many years since John rejoined the band. I mean that seems like just a year ago.
This old school RHCP!
Dear god why is the child predator talking like he’s scottish, this is awful
Three years ago? The 4th of 4 herniated discs - I would have just heard ♾️♥️ at the time - everything would have been only half as intense;   I now treat myself, just like that, everything here in the playlist - everything easy, now!
Where RHCP? Old and kind
3049 é logo ali ... 🤘🏻💀
IN THE YARDDDDDDD
Anyone listening in 3025?
The best of the world
The fact that these guys are in their 50s-60s yet still have the energy of 20 year olds is baffling.
1998 alguien?
The bestia sono in tre world
"Platypus are a few, The secret life of Roo"? 😀 What does this mean? I have wild guesses, but someone who knows exactly could explain please...
2025🎉❤❤
Another masterpiece from the Chili peppers. Love this song
O cara é medonho,mas canta muito.. 😅😅😅
Hi. Love the song but can’t understand what is the meaning of it. Can anybody explain it? Thanks 😅

I believe that most performers in music and other arts have bipolar traits. First of the bat is the pent up energy they have. Also they are never satisfied with their lot. Just a observation.✌️
Still waiting................
❤
Both albums r pure garbage. They hasbeens now. No way near as good as they used to be
once  you  make  it   it   becomes    easier     then       like     starting    over   again    never   satisfied       human    condition    built     in    what    we    are    tod
cremation     choice    i   don't   know   yet    maybe    i    let   you   know    when    i    die          tod       infinity
4050 anyone?
2025
Still here!😂
I agree! They maintain that same energy! This is timelessness!
😮
They all look like homeless guys from downtown L.A.
Platypus are a few, the secret life of roo❤ Anthony i love you
Leymi si ves esto ❤😢
2025. Black man 51, what I love about RHCP is many things but many of their drum patterns are based on Funky Drummer. Moreos than other rock groups they push the drums out in front. Sitting between two large Polk Audi speakers powered by a Sony ES Amp (elevated standard) In the zone
They sound like caca.🎉
Pinches canciones más perras mamalonas alv
Já toquei muito no Guitar Flash
2:11
Just watched this video where some guy with a microphone and a camera was hanging out in a public place asking people wearing a band's t-shirt to name three songs from that band. One of the guys was wearing the same Red Hot Chili Peppers I myself am wearing as I write this, and all he came up with was "That song Weird Al made a parody of." I wish someone would try that with me for any of the band shirts I wear. Then again, I couldn't think of the name of this song, that's why I'm here, cause all I kept coming up with was Black Hole Sun (By Soundgarden) and I knew that wasn't the name. lol
3026 here
1:50
this is a great video
John Frusciante is so good he has just ascended to a higher level.
Why does john look like jesus?

This album Unlimited Love came along at just the perfect moment in time. I even got to see them live in Hershey in 2023 playing some of these songs. The performance on the rooftop in LA, the video for these are the ways. Just gave me something to hold onto at a time we were all struggling with the pandemic. Been a fan since probably 1990. I distinctly remember when Soul to Squeeze was new in 93, I heard it on the in air radio station on a flight to Australia. That song was so special. I hope the chili peppers keep making music as long as their hearts are in it
1:51
Yes 2025
Chad Tony Mike John are noted my best friends.
Forever RHCP❤️‍🔥
Мой прадедушка большой поклонник RHCP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Я тоже!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That mustache and haircut are so bad.  Love to see john.
The last of the Greatest Front Men of the business ❤❤❤
Weather got a bit nice, im back to jam to this. 🫡😎
That solo rips so fucking hard
何回聞いても素晴らしいメロディー！
Great fucking song, love it..
John wick playing the guitar?
Why he flex on us at 2:35
Black What?
Daaaamn pass it 3 years ago
Me gustan por que armonizan el rock con el folk
When I heard this on our Radio Station I couldn't stop listening to the song I was like damn
I am so jealous of people who grow up in their peak and those who listen to them live,sometimes i wish my da make me earlier😢Love yall ❤
1:52
i like my envelope filter too but... dang
Incredible
take that Mike Patton
These guys have been consistently killing it since the 80s. Their hearts are still in it and their bodies are still letting them perform as well. I will absolutely be there for their next tour
Good bass, drums, guitar, and sing 🤗
Fight me: the first verse is the best guitar wise
Big game 2026, anyone?
They all have a unique way of moving that's instantly recognisable. Just adore this band and how they've changed over time, honing their incredible skills. There are so few proper bands that write their own music and lyrics and can play instruments and sing live (without autotune) which makes this band very special; their  endurance is incredible too.
Yess
🟡⚫️
Great Guitar Solo By John Wick🤣🙏💪☝️✊️🙏😂
Classic RHCP ❤
Jeg Febry-Why? 🎵
Brasileiros q amam eles❤👉👊
I’ve always loved the peppers, since 91, but I have to ask, has Anthony developed some kind of speech disorder?
I believe that this song means a lot to Flea
Kalau gue dengerin lagu-lagu Red Hot Chili Peppers.. Gue jd mengenang Kehidupan Suku Navajo.. Di Boulder dan Texas (Last Vegas)..  Jaman dahulu itu begitu indah Texas(Las Vegas) dan Boulder city dan ape lg indahnya Grand Canyon.. Kalau jaman udeh banyak yg Hilang secara Megic keindahan Grand Canyon.... Yg indah Grand Canyon itu dari sisi Dataran Los Angeles dan bukan dari sisi dataran bagian Timur..
I know you're here again
Wow 3 years.. this album was so fucking good. The weekend after it came out that Friday, we went to Florida with all of my cousins. Best fuckin memories man
3 años de la obra maestra que trajo de vuelta a nuestro Frusciante <3
I’m your biggest fan can you pls tour in Australia
Omg that haircut and mustache 😂😂😂

It's incredible how this song is already 3 years old but it seems like yesterday I was on the living room couch in the early hours of the morning waiting for it to be released.
shit music
These guys are idiots
Who's here in 2041?
Nostradamus
i want to listen to this song while riding a horse across the vast steppes of Mongolia...😅😅
What an amazing performance! One of the best musicians ever known ❤
canzone del momento ❤
Little girls anyone ?
2025😢
This song really reminds me of Slow Cheetah on Stadium Arcadium, especially the chorus. I love that!
2025
You all know why you're here in  2025
Well it seems this song is rather very relevant to what's happening in California right now.
No me jodas que el peinado se lo copio a peso pluma  osea sería Anthony pluma  o peso chilli peppars
Is anyone still listening in 2025?
Wishing you a prosperous and rewarding journey!

I love this
Wicked tune
This is so dope 🔥
01/01/2025 🤘🏾
2025 and we are here!!! RHCP 4ever!!
Remember when we found out John was coming back?!!❤❤❤
This song relates a lot to Californication in my mind, because that came out around the time when I was born and most of the topics in there I didn't know much about at all. The topics here though I lived through so there's a different experience to listening to this vs Californication. And one day when the people born when this song came out grow up they'll listen to it the same way I do to Californication.
Uma das poucas coisas na vida que me da alegria, obrigado pela excelente musica.
This band has its own way of defining music, i love rhcp
<3
John is so great on guitar
2:36 mira mamá de sólo olvidarme las letras 💪🏼

Anthony looks so good
Hey, when you guys came out with this song literally two days later, I was showing my dad and then he got Mercer and passed away. Thank you. You guys for giving me that time to listen to a song this song with him before he passed I will forever be in remembering this song because of that.
Hoje eu comecei esse álbum dó red hot chili Peppers é espero que seja maravilhoso, 22 dê dezembro dê 2024 às 8:11 AM.
Music that is the sound that is the drug
John è uno dei migliori interpreti del suono stratocaster
This song reminds me of the old golden days of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Hello from Brazil
eu te amo, joão.
Impeachment do Lula já. Não vamos esperar ele acabar com o país, campanha do Impeachment agora 🇧🇷
Red hot is life foreverrr
I knew they could still rock.  But I did not expect them to write this.  As good as the best song they ever wrote.  So cool.
❤
Yo
This song need some time to grow on you...that guitar solo, omg.
Always a good one
Possibly that time Will Robinson found a cave, but climbing back is not an option. So explore that Dwelve dungeon, find it's secrets see anything living among those trees and branches and John Robinson remembers those days they he was at military service at KTU wanted day after trying to melt it.
Porque los amo tanto ❤
Parece o Chaves de bigode
Энтони! Убери эти усики! Пожалуйста! Буть снова молодым и любимым! From Russia with love ❤️ I will always

Will Farrel is such a talented drummer
Please  keep going❤❤❤❤
Anthony Kiedis - Born in 1962. 62 years old. Damn he and his band are still rockin and still a great band producing new music ! Most bands just rides the wave of their old hit songs, not RHCP !
During the wait finish the ink  During the talk passing words attending shadows grafting  Glances showing thought                                              –locks
“Durk side of the moon”. What’s this Irish accent he’s doing here? It’s funny.
It's been a long time since I made a new friend..
yup! pull up yer socks the chili's are coming
That Classic Peppers sound after all these years, and welcome back John.
I love this springtime i think ill instead of ordering a pizza for those gags well blend something inn more splenderous

this song was a beam of light for me when it came out
Goat band 💪💪
I've always thought — the most fwd sound usually comes from Cali (exception given to Sonic Youth). Reason? No reason, just pure dumb tech.
Omg Alan wake on the guitar?

Welcome back john🖐
Honestly... Anthony's look here.. No matter how many years I'm alive.. Will just look retarded lol
this song moves me in a way that is indescribable...masterpiece.
Excellent, varied rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun!
make band music great again😍😍😍😍😍
The skies refuse to cry
My local radio station plays 5 🌶️ songs. Not this one anymore. This is awesome. Perfect happens man.
2 Years ago when the doctors make me my cesárea, someone puts this song. They didn't know that RHCP is my favorite band. I was happy and not too much afraid
I feel like black summer in spirit is a sequel to under the bridge

Long-lived RHCP!Love the consistency on their music ❤
i love the Chili's like old old stuff, this is just pretty boring and the chorus is a Butthole Surfers rip off.
This song didn't exist in 2019
Can't get enough of that RHCP sound
All of the red hot chili peppers music videos are Antony Kiedis and Flea doing crazy stuff

I was expecting one of their toe poppin' shuffles and got Popeye the Sailor man instead. Mr.Anthony went full Popeye. Skeebeedeedo skeebeedeedo gubba gubba gubba. I kinda wish Johnny would kick a hole in this song....

That first solo is an instant classic from John.
Chucky Norris ? 😂😂😂 O tempo não passa para esses caras, muito bom.
I am so happy that John is back in the band it wasn't the same without him. Thanks guys for such an amazing album like this. Love this band since I was a child
That guitar solo is so soulful and epic. First time I heard it on the radio I knew this was a special song.

We're witnessing a Black Summer here in Brazil. The skies are orange and foggy, the rivers are drying, the forests are burning. This song is hitting close to home.
I never knew keanu reeves could play guitar
the peppers broke out when i was in high school with blood sugar sex magik. i cant believe 30 years later i am listening to new music.

John Wick back on RHCP😅
I think this is one of their best songs ever.
Ok, John is one of the most talented guitarist ever seen… but can we talk about flea? Flea, i think, is very important too! He and John are soo connected and one take the best out of the other !!! ❤❤❤
Did he say V word on the moon
Anthony's vocals are better than ever and the whole band sounds like they never stopped making magic together. Amazing.
Shout out to Hillel Slovak
деды вообще неугомонные, дай Бог здоровья им
The band use to be good back in the day now he looks rediclous
love u frusciante 4ever
Band is awesome
So many years later and their lyrics still make no sense😅
Mabe
Blackie actually spoke to me.. even as he double take that look. I'm just wtf .. you have children.. you were a child.. but we were your children with children.. too. Hey you.. My mom called. Said  isn't that your band? Red hot chilli peppers? I said  what? She said. Olympics.. they played closing ceremony " I said cool  She said " is this the band you were so crazy for? I don't understand.. I said mom. What happened? She said " I'm asking you. Is this them?
This music video is on a red hot fiery roll!
Waiting on another black summer to end⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫
Listening to my sweety four year old daughter shouting "Waidin Amma Waidinnananana Black Summer Dooway" running round the house then without pausing "Anthony did take his shirt off, see Daddy".  I told her he would!
Hi ❤
Hi
Encore un album largement au niveau, de bout en bout. Je continue d'acheter les cds, vaille que vaille !!!!! ..j'adore RHCP ;))
2:23
After listening to RHCP songs for more then 25 years I ´ve bought RHCP T-shirt lately, I am 62 now.
red hot peppers because they light up despite the increase! by the way, the grandfather of the guitarist does not jump badly!!
I freaking love them 💖
I’ve been with my “boyfriend” for the past year. We were friends for 5 years  before that. Smoking buddies mostly. I only see him once a week to have sex, I know he loves me but this type of relationship is getting old for me. I heard this song on the radio today and it really resonated with me and my situation. I just noticed the title of the song and makes me think if this black summer needs to end.
Been a fan since the MTV days. Possibly one of the top 3 bands of all time.
<3
LOVE THAT THEIR BACK SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋

Getting Jethro Tull vibes.
Wow
Chinas still on the derk side of the moon
The RHCP are true artists who obviously have more music to give the world 35yrs after their inception.  I seen them in 1992 at Lollapaloosa & again in 2000 with The Foo-Fighters opening for them.
Muy bonitos los solos de frusciante, pero todo un desperdicio si no los haces en vivo
I’ve really never noticed until very recently (2016+) that the band’s lyrics have so much meaning; other than the blatant. It’s good for the soul. I actually used to have this as one of my lesser-liked songs….until the past few listens. 🤘🏳️‍🌈🖤🔑🌖
Best,best,best
as of now. anthony is 61 years old. by the all sensors... he is likely going to be making albums for another 20 years.

You rocks 🤗

Such a good song, and the mastering is mint
Just heard this live on the 25th and man it's really good these dudes rocking in their 60s rock hard you need to go see them
There are two types of people. People who think the chilli peppers are one of the greatest bands ever, and those who are stupid.
Love it
In my feels.  😢

I went to the ultimate love tour and oh my god I think I fell in love a bit more with this band also u gotta love a butt naked flee to make the consent more interesting 😂😂😂
Comback Love Music!!! 😊❤😎🤟😁👍☺️👏🙏
Well this has definitely been feeling like a Black Summer so far 🥵.
This is my shit ❤
I bet we can get rid of the sun (meaning global warming), by getting rid of the Son (Jesus)
Spectacular!
это как старая Америка. круто.
who can handle this kind of energy? in and out?
The guitar solo is okay, nothing special, really.  But if you RHCP die hards want to overrate nearly everything about this song, I can live with that, if someone will just back me up on ONE item: what the FUCK is up with Anthony sporting that Gary Ridgeway-style mustache?  If he's trying to, say, meet middle age half-way, well, all I can say is, there's got to be a more likeable way to do so!  Seriously, that 'stache should, by rights, be a legacy killer.  It needs to go!
I got one of them belts that you tighten around your thigh, the kind with the bladed hooks on it so that it eats into my skin really good. It hurts, I need it to hurt.

RHCP has its own genre, their style never dies and still rocking today.
A bit too simple, this song.
Just saw them last night live in PA video coming
I don't know why Fruciante's guitar makes me cry.

Only band that has ever made me regret not experiencing what using heroin under a bridge felt like….
This band has helped me through some dark times there music is brilliant and touches all our hearts let's have a rhcp festival we need a field and just play there music bring yer guitars

I get an Irish Sea Chantey vibe from this song. Another Red Hot song from the 😡 🔥 🌶 🌶
This is a very awesome song!
this feels like stadium arcadium so much
I listened to his music a lot when it came out two years ago, it gave me a lot of emotions and strong tears, today my life is going even worse so it's even worse  The song is amazing
Black summer??? Anyone 😅
John F!!!stratocaster god
I think we can all agree that we’re riding on a headless horse (Biden).
I should of listened to the words a long time ago. Can I come to one of your gigs please. Babe .x.
I'm trying to get back to feeling higher power around and I am feeling better, the music sounds better colours are sharper and I am speaking quicker. I'm beating all the witchcraft and black magic that was sent my way, it's probably reversed or boomeranged back to them. Finally I think I am healing FOR REAL. BABYX
Great ❤❤❤
Why does this start with Fields of Athenry's melody?
The summer this came out it was my theme. This year it’s Summertime Voodoo by highly suspect. Love this still in ‘24! Right up there with Dark Necessities & Tippa My Tongue 💯🖤🔥🤘
Listening to this song 2 years later, it feels like I heard it 15 years ago on an old MP3 player, but at the same time, it feels like it just came out last week. At 33, I realize that these artists have been a significant part of my life for more than half of it already. Time seems to be passing quickly lately
I have their new CD amazing album from beginning to end. I'm 41, I've been a fan since mid 90s.
At the beginning I thought it was Jethro Tull rock on chili peppers

Been a long time since I made a new friend ♪♫
давайте еще ребята!! вы нам нужны
And after two years China claimed they went in the dark side of the moon.
I absolutely love this song, the only thing I would change (get ready ...), I wish Chad had played his part on a vintage drum set, like on an old Ludwig or Gretsch set, not so much a modern sounding set, to match the vintage tones of the 61 jazz bass and 60s Strat.  Just saying.
OMG Keanu Reeves
How do you know about chinas plans lmfao
RHCP 1984 - 2022
This is how legends come back ...
Isso só me lembra o mar , sol bom demais
I love watching Will Ferrell play drums
What? Did Anthony turn Irish all of the sudden? 😂😭
👍I'm waiting too!  it's coming.  😮🤯😍🦚
This song is amazing I hope chili peppers make a huge Come Back this rocks man I’m crying seriously crying thanks guys
Love it!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Headless horse to make the trip..... baby Blue Pinto.🤘
Listen to this for days in az 120° no a.c for me outside i walk no car no mo
This song feels like Desecration Smile and Road Trippin’s baby. Melodic, earthly, and refined in its powerful impact.
正直、ジョシュをやり捨てした時はだいぶイラッとしたけど、Black summerのジョンのソロ聴いた時に、これだよこれ！っぱ、ジョンしか勝たん！と思ってしまった事実。

A American Indian singing a Irish Cadence song.  And another Black Summer to end. 2024.
hendrix a la frusciante. what a great band that only gets better. scar tissue pulled them back together and probably saved a few of their lives. how lucky we are that it did.

thanks rhcp for this excellent song
Anthony Kiedis não perde prá ninguém nem mesmo pela calvície
That classic RHCP sound. Gotta love these guys.
Voces sao os melhores
Instant classic RHCP song
Better version here: /watch?v=9d952wJFUWA
I am definitely here because I haven't heard this song but Hildegard von Blingin' did a cover and the lyrics had my brain in a death grip.
Robin Williams and Anthony Hopkins are trike inspired casting options for these characters. I was surprised by his much I liked Jetemy Irons, too. That would have been a reallly neat way to take the story.
🌹🌹🌹
thumbs up if you're here because of Hildegard Von Blingen
Какой шикарный голос, как в 25 лет!❤
I have no idea what this songs about and I'm ok with that.
rip yune is a good dude
😡
2024 now
why does he say the words like that
Slowly getting used to Anthony's mustache mullet look. I just say he has the classic Eddie Guerrero look xD
Underrated
Unpopular opinion : this song got hands down the best guitar solo ever
Recuerdo el día que salió está rola, me puse mis audífonos y en cuanto empezó el solo tuve un orgasmo auditivo 👌🏻
these guys will be friends until the awful day
Someone listen to this Song 2024?
The locks make it
I believe their essence is relaxation and peace, without ignorance to the world around us. They accept human nature and that we will never change, so might as well have fun.
RHCP still sound stuck in the 90s
Bliss! I love the key change in the chorus
I could swear that I hear Ian Anderson in first part of song.
Unlimited love
thanks for another GREAT SONG -peace  out
that track is a hit
It is a wonderful,beautiful song. Not feeling the name though as Summer is my favorite thing, just cant se it as black...? Wonder why they mamed it that.
best ever
This is the best fucking video when you are stoned af.  ( Like i'm right now ) ! EVER ✌️
good to know  others   feel the same way
can't help but I notice that Chad doesn't always get recognition. and I know that I'm not the only one to realise that.
I just remember as a young kid hearing californication for the first time back in 2000. Got close to the same emotions with this new video/song 24 years later. They nailed it.

Fuck...this song brought a smile back to my gloomy face
0:29 so cool that Danny Trejo sings for RHCP
Перцы и в Африке перцы
People complain when bands change their music, but RHCP has kept their sound, and of course, people complain that their music has never changed and all sounds the same.   This song is amazing. I am so impressed at the music they put out at this age. I do not have to worry about any changes I won't like with them. They know how to stay true to themselves.
is there anything these guys can't do? every song is just great. forget the stuff on the radio. listen to their albums. some of their best songs don't make it to the radio
lyrics are wild but ill take it
Well Dam I just discovered this gem of a song. I have only had one # 1 band of all time and these dudes are making me change my # 1.
I never comment but this from Santa Cruz half pipe thanks you
you know instantly there is a talent or gift or whatever you wanna call it when you are introduced to something special. When I was 14, I first heard RHCP, I didn't understand a word because I did not speak English back then but what I understood was the pure pleasure of listening to the music of their Californication album. I don't know how John does what he does musically and instrumentally but man this is something beyond this world
A DICÇÃO DELE É PERFEITA.
ESSA SIM É UMA BANDA COMPLETA. OLHA COMO ESSE VOCALISA SE EXPRESSA❤❤ DANÇA NA SEQUÊNCIA DA MUSICA! TEM RITMO! ESTILO! VOZ DIFERNCIADA. UMA BANDA PERFEITA. O SOM DAS GUITARRAS, BATERIA, BAIXOS! TODOS IMPECAVEIS
❤❤❤ esse é o canal oficial da banda?
EU NÃO ENJOO DE OUVIR 😊😊❤❤❤
❤AMO RED HOT CHILe PEPPERS
JOOOOOOOOOOOHN

Anthony looking ripped as hell
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Parabéns / Congratulations Se vc curte essa música, com certeza tem um ótimo gosto musical ... Toda positividade... Jah Bless ... #fechacompai 😎✌🏼
One of my favorite videos. Reminds me of when I was in Dublin for biz and toured their parks --30 shades of green.❤
The moment I heard Frusciante 0.45 I legit cheered, proper chillies back together

Saya sudah hapal lagu ini. Terus saya putar berulangkali buat nyanyi bareng sama mereka
Me mama red hot
wow ya paso 2 años , recuerdo que lo vi en estreno por accidente y desde ahí lo tengo marcado como el inicio del 2022 , :/
The boys are back, my elder brother love RHCP
After being about 30 years fan of the chili peppers only can say thanks guys. I’m 46 now and still a baby I think. I just flew like 16 hours from Chile 🇨🇱 to LA to see you at Amoeba show that only last about 3 songs. Whatever. Midlife crisis made the other part. What a beautiful thing to be a part of LA vibe in this point of lifetime. Love to all. My video https://youtu.be/brofgwqUzNQ?si=hy-AdAwMUoTb3fNI
Still a great band, with great vibes. Love these guys, and look forward to many more albums to come.
eu ainda não acredito que vi isso ao vivo, que VIVI isso.
Круто, но, послушай Гражданскую Оборону.
🌶️🌶️🌶️😍😍😍
I love this song!! 💥🔋🎵

That's because Flea is a magical creature from the 4th dimension He transcends human capabilities
1:35 2:50 Is it just me or those moments looks a bit like ballad of dwight fry by Alice Cooper but with clearly a lot much more of rhythm ?
From Russia❤
Best all around band of all times
No drugs here ... move along :D
Meh
This is so early 2000s. Love it!
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹wowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
We love the way Anthony sounds like he's singing a sea shanty. Brilliant song, brilliant band!
white boy swag
Still dope
70 era
My favorite of this song is " get it on" .. feels like a slipped in secret of sorts.. Just love that little part.
Shout out to this song for being the only RHCP song available on Rockband 4.
Is there gonna be an acoustic version 😅
Now the message is more clearer than ever Californiation
No more Black Summers please
Oh yessss
why not ;)
Volver a escuchar esa guitarra con los acordes escupidos por demonios paganos... es una caricia al alma.
I still remember when I heard that riff for the first time ¡how quickly time goes by!
Sounds like Shimshai?
Honestly Anthony needs to ditch the stash
Nice groove by the chillipeckers
Love from Panama ❤

Anthony is savage. He looks so bad ass when he sings “crack the flaming whip, sailing on a censorship” and flexes then makes the cut throating motion. What a beast
Love this song
Every single note John plays lands so perfectly as always! It's so satisfying. Ahhh.
Wow

John's solos just rip right through your soul and you love it every second of it.
I listen this group almost all my life since 1997 and at same time fan on Frsuciante music, i really wish u all health guys and no matter how old u will be, your always chili peppers, thank u for all :)
It is amazing the longer this band is around the more the drummer carries them. IE since snow
Com a volta do John esperava um cd melhor com o mesmo gosto de Stadium arcadium
John dando cátedra de como tocar un solo usando un Fuzz, pero haciéndolo sonar de forma sutil.
2 years😢
Happy Birthday Black Summer (Happy Birthday to me lol)
good song
exactly 2 years from this legendary moment
Is that a dead cat glued to his face?
Beautiful guitar work by John and he’s clearly making a statement upon his much anticipated return. Lifelong fans are rejoiced crying tears of joy??? AND then you got Anthony’s pirate voice 😂 These 4 guys are the bands soul. I couldn’t bring myself to listen to them when John’s absence took place. I was smacking myself and making sure I wasn’t dreaming when they said John rejoined. I love all four of them and they have resonated through my speakers for decades and are the reason I pick up my guitar and drum sticks. This is a success very few bands have and I’m still making sure this isn’t a dream. Even a couple years later I’m just still amazed. Love em hope they stick it out for even just a couple more albums but regardless I’m grateful. Much love ❤
Фрушанте - просто дистилированный кайф!!!!
LIKE ME ARROUND THE COURIOUS LETTER
I love playing yalls songs at the beach and surfing thanks for the memories guys keep it up

Awesome song and sound! Gone back to their roots. Thank god,because the Dave Navarro years are forgettable
ROCK!
Que saudade de uma boa musica!! Excelente!!!!

ЭТО ПРОСТО ФШОВИФШЙНРУНРПНЦЕМИНШ
Such an amazing and unique band. STILL rocking. THIS is REAL music!
This song was released on my late fathers birthday, he passed two months before and never go to hear this beautiful song from his favorite band. What was once a band him and I could bond over, is now something i cry to everytime i hear... i miss you dad.
mas se usar essa opçao como vai movimentar o cursor
As an Australian, this song hits extra hard
❤ from Russia)
I love this song and I have always respected the Chili Peppers but Flea has never impressed me much. For someone so famous for playing bass I always expected more. He has honestly never learned to smooth his notes out and play funkier and with more style. He is very choppy and dull. If you're playing funky rock bass your notes should be smooth and blend from one to the next. My opinion.
I freaking love chads drumming!! (Also a drummer)  He’s so nonchalant and humble.  He even says it hisself—  “I’m just a straight up rock n roll drummer…” Meaning he doesn’t fancy himself the second coming of John Bonham.    He gets the job done with hard work and dedication, and that is what makes him not only admirable, but great.   Also: for everyone that pops a will ferral comment—go fuck yourself in a dirty, lonely corner.  Chad is Chad and looks like Chad.   Appreciate his artistry and get over your sad, self-fucking existence.
And China’s on the dark side of the Moon 🎶🎵🌈🤌
Que lastima que la vida del ser humano tie limites porque desearia fuesen eternos estos genios

What a great song. 3:34 cymbals unsynchronized on purpose ?
Esta canción es un clásico atemporal.
No more drugged lesbians ? Great ! Frusciante ? Great !
His voice is still good
Perfection.😂
Where's the love button lol ❤
Good to see Will Farrell still playing the drums for them 😂

How many years do you have? Peppers fans  I'm 19
Anthony Kiedis is a great poet.
This is best song
❤❤❤🎉
=)
Best tune they will ever do 😮
I've been listening to this on december 31.2023 and 2:51 (the "explosion" part) hit right on midnight! Happy new year y'all <3
can’t believe it’s been 30+ years already i feel like listening to them for the first time back in 1998 was just yesterday and another thing is they still sound the same while singing
Wow amazing song especially the part about the storm troopers china 🇨🇳.
🤟🏼💀
buena música, buen sonido, me gusta
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
I am obsessed with this song, love the video and Anthony looks FANTASTIC!!
I love how they have matured into themselves without trying to recapture what they used to be. They don't need to do that because who they are now is exactly who we need them to be. Absolute perfection.
SIGO MANIJA DESDE EL RECITAL , NO ME JUZGUEN JAJAJ
Its Cakifornication drum beat
Wow Anthony is so cut more than ever. Does he ever reach his peak? It just gets better and better. Plus he would be the coolest person to know as his lyrics always touch my soul and resonate. I met him once when I was 17.... He wanted to hire a cellphone. We were in a camera shop in queen st Auckland. I approached him and he was so nice.
Very good... Ever... chilli Peppers
Hermosa línea de bajo!
Fui al show de river el 26 nov 23 increible con Frusciante de vuelta
Wait OVER! ❤
John humble and honest. Illl meet you down in dingle when youe settled.
These four young lads are going places 🥰
Awesome 😮
Insane to think they’re 80+ years of age
Love it ❤❤❤❤
Jodidamente rola hermosa ❤🎉😢
This is not the best RHCP song but we can recommend every RHCP fan this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tla4gcgXSHM

RHCP are a national treasure. Still the best type of California even though that Cali has been gone for a long time
Essa música ao vivo é coisa de outra dimensão!! Vi a apresentação dela no show deles em Brasília, junto com o sol projetado no telão criou um ambiente surreal de maravilhoso de presenciar! Os caras sabem engrandecer qualquer música deles ao vivo e não precisam de pirotecnia pra deixar todo mundo envolvido com o momento!
Il loro stile,che ti attrae.Sono così loro.Insomma piacciono.😅❤
man... i already knew this, but flea is SO good on bass. you cant not hear him, and hes just ridiculous good.
10 días pasaron ya de River y sigo manijaa.... Simplemente ESPECTACULARES❤
John my idol
Didn't know that Keanu Reeves is so good at guitar
I thought this song was old! wtf 2022🤨
WHY HAVE I BEEN WAITING?!?!?
It’s pretty cool all the dad bands are making a comeback 🤘

Bad ass! love the peppers💯🌶️
I am OBSESSED with this song !! ❤❤❤ they look great !!!

Antony ❤ gato lindo ❤
Flea is genius!!!!!!!!

Black Summer, um dos pontos altos do show em Curitiba, Brasil. Estava lá, espetacular.
Yeah they're amazing
Great song

When did the Anthony morph into an Iggy Pop pornstar ?
My friend kept singing this and it was annoying as since I did not know the song but I have sat down and I’m now listening to it,I actually rlly like it ❤
Still loving you
Eu fui no show desses caras !!! Nunca irei esquecer !
This song is fantastic! One of the best songs they  released ever
This is so moving as Californication for me.
Nem acredito que ouvi essa obra de arte ao vivo no show em São Paulo dia 10/11 😍
Por Siempre una de mis bandas favoritas! Aguante Red Hot Chilli Peppers Forever!
Essa aqui é linda e ao vivo é melhor ainda!!
Chili Peppers Forever❤
Essa foi a melhor música que ouvi dia 10 em sp, um dos melhores dias da minha vida.
I don't know why but I would see this song in a trinita
Постарел братка
My favorite band of all time. Plus this is my favorite song of all time.
I think that the new Beatles song 'now and then' is actualy a RHCP cover, I definitely hear RHCP
Larga vida a los red hot chili Peppers !
🤩🤩🤩🤩
love love love this song, everything about it! <3
Fui al concierto de Río de Janeiro y cuando la tocaron sonó 100/10 espectacular
Fui no show de Brasília e só posso agradecer o universo por me proporcionar uma experiência tão incrível Foda demaisss
Uno de mis grupos favoritos ❤
Fui ao show deles no RJ Que Experiencial INCRÍVEL!!
Para mim, uma das melhores músicas deles!! ♡♡♡♡♡
Билан, ты ли это? 🤣
Red hot😎🤘
Обожаю перцев. Люблю всем сердцем. С  2001 года после прослушивания альбома Калифорникейшн они стали для меня чем то больше чем музыкальная группа.
Eu só quero ouvir e cantar essa música dia 10/11 em São Paulo logo, que ansiedadeeeeeeee! Falta apenas 4 dias <3 <3
Even after so long, they continue to put out hits.  Let this be a reminder that we all have potential, even after many years.  Dont hold back if theres something youve been meaning to do.  The fire continues to burn.  Ignite it.
Anthony with the Irish accent
Без  Джона Фурщанте - та його соло група без перцю  Не зірвись знову-таки в наркоад.
Hold up - is it 1998 all over again?!?!?
This is it .by chestermoore .   Don't put all yr eggs in one basket..no cock  blockers allowed
Prevalecerá como un legado excelente canción, no como la chatarra de reguetoon de hoy en día
1:52 - 2:20 no wonder it's most replayed, frusciante had all souls and emotions right there
This is an anthem…like californication, under the bridge… RHCP are my fav band ever!  i listen to them every fucking day 🥹❤️
I’ll keep saying that in every Black Summer videos on youtube; BOSS CE-1 is the BEST CHORUS PEDAL EVER MADE.
Gran directo en San José Costa Rica
John, Josh says the song you made with RHCP is bad, it's not like the songs Josh made before, I thought it would be as good as the previous album but it turns out it's not good at all, it makes I sleepy
Всем Евреям послушать, забыли своё прошлое, что вы делаете?

Majes que chuzo de espectaculo se echaron ayer en Costa Rica !!! <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😅😅😅😅
When I listen to this band, I feel like I'm back to good times I've never experienced before.
ive loved this song ever since you made the song
I love you guys, cant wait to see you in Brazil 🇧🇷❤️
You didn’t think I’m stupid I won’t trap China they doing ok
They say you can’t relive the past, but RHCP just gave us another 3:54 of 1994.  Thank you!
China on the dark side of the moon

Группа, которая не развалилась. SUPER.
Brought me back to my New York days...... Love love love
fuck it... I love Flea, he has a... vibe
Guitar solo is awesome, bravo 👏🏼
RHCP in Costa Rica 🤟
I love how the mixed Fleas bass in the top of the mix and super prevalent. Sounds like the ole RHCP.
🔥
love how the sound is still unmistakably Red Hot Chili Peppers
I cant believe people like this
'tis a grand ol' modern sea shanty 🏴‍☠
The guitar sounds like it's drunk with the effect.
Nunca pasa de moda <3 RHCP
The talent and skill is absolutely undeniable, This group is as solid as ever..thank You guys for the music!!!
hot dam this is good
L assolo di chitarra è da paura
que temon x favoor

Зима 1997-98 Червоні, гарячі, Чілійські перці зі своїм бомбейським - секс, цукор, магія... Піднімали настрій
They have their own sound still sounds good and uplifting good jam on a Sunday too
1:51 Return of the God of Guitar.
What amazes me the most is how much Frusciante can get out of so few notes, F/n incredible  They are all legends in their own time
This music video is so goofy 😂 but I love it
Joe exotic
oh those few few notes, so melancholic...vooooom, heart open. I love this band so so much
Visually
Lords shot me with a Cupid’s bow to my heart ❤️ during healing more to reveal
Whats with the pirate accent in this song??
10000 my likes
How come the beat sounds the same as the rest of the songs the song .?
🎚🤙
You can really hear a few of their era’s in this one! Lyrically it sounds like it could be Californication era. First guitar solo giving us the satisfying long solos that we loved especially through Stadium Arcadium era. Chorus and bridge sound a bit By the Way. And damn it Kiedes is in even better shape now than in the under the bridge video. Just saw them live for the first time this year and was mind blown. I become a teenager and was getting into them and playing guitar and frusciante became my guitar idol, and that was just about the time he left the band. I always hoped he would eventually come back again and I’d get to see my favorite lyricist, drummer, bassist and guitarist play together again. It was literally a dream come true, however cheesy that sounds. These guys are just taking victory laps at this point. I can’t think of many other artists/bands ever to be able to keep this level of excellence up for well over 30 years!
Anyone seeing this in 2023?
A band that always kept its style. Respect RHCP!
*the vibes looks like Doctor Strange throws into 20+ universe*
Confident. 🙌🏾💯❤️🫶🏽🤷🏽‍♀️
People forget that their in their 60s
The Road to Hell
These guys just don’t give a f* about age… they just don’t know what it is 🔥 LOVE them!
My go to song always
in my opinion the greatest living rock band on the planet Thanx RHCP
Welcome back John
BLAST! 💥

Chad Smith refusing to take off the hat and wear the same style clothing as them lol
i just discovered this song and it feels like “Under The Bridge’s” younger brother
Amazing video!
Legend, best formation 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 John, flea Child, Anthony, & Chad. 👍👍👍👍👍
Why Will Ferrell is on the drums?
I LOVE U FLEA
Flea we know is brilliant but I never realized how good of a guitarist John is… his heavy riffs are haunting
Fantastic song!! Reminds us the good old days back in the 90s
The last great 90s rock band left
This song is a vibe
I like more josh klinghoffer
So rascist
Best Come Back Ever❤🔥
Sonho no dia que poderei ir há um show deles ❤ feras 🇧🇷
My Dad *loved* the RHCP - and he had hundreds of records and was always into music - this is the first song he never got to enjoy. It's special in a sad way to me.
Bring back so much memories with this familiar unique vocal sound, guitar tone, bass note. Long live RHCP
I'm old enough to remember thus album coming out, I felt like I was the only person that listened to the entire album. I'm much older now & managed to live through any thing or two. I'm  amazed to see every tomorrow.  waiting
This Band is forever young! ❤
John Frusciante 👌
T . T
❤💚
Is that Will Farrell on drums?
im watching this for making it a part of my child hood well it is alr a part of my child hood
I love the chilli peppers but Anthony has to change his hair but besides that Great song
RHCP is just the best!!
RHCP ❤
Esta rolita me tranquiliza, me hace viajar en el tiempo.
Hey Anthony, lost my fav auntie Queen.  Gonna take her to a Cherokee Reservation.  Perplexed.
Anthony Keidis, Flea, Will Ferrell, and Keanu Reeves is my favourite bang
I swear I have become obsessed with this song, ya can't help but feel the love with these guys, I've always loved RHCP, I guess it's just renewed my passion for life!
I didnt know keanu reeves played as guitarist in r.h.c.p.
HOT FIRE
Frusciante's sound is so distinctive, that you don't even have too watch him play to know that it is actually him. Guitar legend.
Frusciante is John Wick playing guitar
Antoni kidies não perde prá ninguém nem mesmo para a calvície
I missed John’s solo
Today's day feels like this song
Son los mejores!! Por dios esta canción es brutal. Obra de arte. Nos dieron todo lo que queríamos.  Rick Rubin , la vuelta del gran John, Chad luciendose como nadie, y en el video tenemos a Flea sobre los hombros de Anthony como en los viejos tiempos. Realmente hicieron todo bien 🥹
I feel like the iconic anthon ego´s ratatoullie scene.  🖤
I'm 41 and I an getting my hair cut just like this now😂
La misma esencia de sus comienzos, SON ETERNOS, terrible legado musicall
Sounds like the 1990's.
They stayed true to themselves for over 35 years!!! AWESOME BAND!! NEVER AGAIN WILL THERE BE ANOTHER!👊
Kalifornikesyennn
Anthony gets old like we all wish we could😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤
John is BACK MF!!! VRISTIMMM 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Is that will Farrel on the drums? Lol
RHCP are my go-to muzic🎉

Rhcp knows what to deliver. They have so many songs that it’s so easy for them to choose what they want on an album. John give what the people want. It’s so easy
Love you’re crazy-nis , don’t know how I can write this right
Love❤
Fantastic...
I was watching the Red Hot chilli peppers get an award. The comments made about how they are like a family is how they have made it together so long. 30 years awesome keep on playing guys
I really like this song and the lyrics are great too
Welcome to this brand new classic- I can foresee the next generation fans shouting the lyrics under the stage!
What a sound.
Hey guys, this is such an epic band, I'd be really interested to know what some more RHCP fans think of my latest Music video for my latest track "Headache" I'm pretty happy with how it came out, its alt rock (RHCP/Cage The Elephant meets Lana Del Rey), borderlands game inspired visuals. It would help this penniless independant artist doing this himself a lot just by checking it out and sharing your thoughts. Cheers guys have a great one!
Njirr Anthony udah pakde2 bgt.. Tp masih bagus bodynya.. 😭
Imoralz
No le cambio nada la voz a Kiedis por dios, es la misma y tiene 60 años 🤍
This song is great. My favourite song of this album Unlimited Love and one of the best Red Hot Chilli Pepper's song.
Damn John wick got good at guitar
The lyrics are completely nonsensical as always but we DO NOT CARE! :)
Yes!!! Long live RHCP!!!!!
John curang bgt yg lain udah eyang2 dia masih bapack2 sendiri..
Lyrics please 🙏😁👍
Que bien rockeraba Diego Verdaguer.
This is insanely good and catchy. They really never die
Serrr
as i said for a year ago im so glad John is back =)
This song will always make me think of Flea walking through a sunny forest❤️
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
56 myself and my God, at almost 60 Anthony is ridiculously ripped. Inspiring!
Tomar song
Бесподобно и великолепно❤ желаю им долгих лет творческого вдохновения❤❤❤
❤BOOOOAAH, HOW John is playing his guitar..🎸 UNBELIEVEBAL🎼🎶❤ I'M SOOOO HAPPY, THAT JOHN IS COMMING BACK TO THE CHILI'S, REALLY!! WOW, I LOVE THE RHC.P❤

RHCP forever!!!
Love
que grandes los red hot!!! son una locura los espero con ansias el 24 de noviembre!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will Ferrell can really pound them skins
I'm a big fan of RHCP and I think this album is a big mistake. I was waiting for Frusciante to come back to get a bunch of cool songs, but I got only disappointment. This is the worst album, please get back on track. p.s. only this track is good, no offense
Gracias por seguir sacando música nueva ❤
I'm 62 years old and finally got to see the Red Hot chili peppers back in May this year. Hangout fest in Gulf shores Al.
I didn't get to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers until I was 62, I got to see him at Hangout fest in Gulf shores.  I was blown away
What with the karate suit

I love RHCP

Minneapolis in 2020 be like: 1:39
return to form for the chilis <3

Good bands change with the times. Great bands changes the times they’re in.
This song is such a blatant rip off of the guy on til tok who does the music cooking stuff with the puppet
Why does it sound like he sings “China’s on the dark side of the moon” in a Welsh accent? 😂
Say what you will but Keidis song writing skills are sublime and the delivery with the whole composition just 👌🏾That it manages to so poignantly capture some of the climate impacts from 2019 leaves me in awe of this band that just seems to be timeless!
Ty for this banger keep the flair of this… I’d say unlimited love has only amazing and great tracks
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anthony Kiedis still looks good, and good se Flea is hasn't lost any of his edge.
I love this song so much, at the same time I'm convinced that RHCP lyrics are a work of some very poor AI prototype. Nonsense.
Seems most of they're songs are about the plasma apocalypse 😊
This band never gets old
🖤
Senhor, eu não verei isso pessoalmente em novembro, é um desmotivo pra viver
This band is a Legend
*LYRICS*  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
There are days where you just feel too messy to get anything done.
I ❤ Anthony's dance. It's crazy and funny.
Do not let it die  0:54
If there's a Big Lebowski sequel, this should be the soundtrack.
Chili Peppers 🇵🇪🤟🫶
It's kinda goofy how Anthony fakes an irish-type accent in the first verse
I love frusciante 1:52 😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing ... ❤️ Redhot since when i was 14 years old .in 1995
So beautiful
The real side of me will show
🤎🌹 3 amigos
Igual que slipknot mantienen la esencia
The real rhcp is back
That haircut and stash-does he have a mirror? :P
2:35 WTF?!?!??!? He is fucking ripped
Wow😢
The guitar work is so beautiful
extraño a JOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    PERO NO PUEDO NEGAR DE JOHN!!!!
J'aimais beaucoup Josh😢
john vocals are a blessing for the soul
So good back in the day....respect you keep going
1:40 you can sadly hear autotune here on 'end' (you dont need to thank me for destroying you this song)
Changez moi ces coupes de cheveux !!!!!!!!
❤❤❤
JBT sto je ovo dobro, nakbolje nesto u zsdnjih 10 godina, RCHP best ever
Johnny Silverhand is so good in this song! One of his best! 🤣
I always love how much Anthony is vibing with all these songs, he's been doing that shit since the 80's.
Leprechaun be squirtin like that yo

Saw this amazing band in dublin 2021 and they played this song, i must say no disappointment
Soyez sympa les rouges chaud .... Reprenez l'héro et refaite de la bonne zik
I still wonder why will ferrell is playing those drums
Satanist called alienize season black spring black summer white fall white winter
best tune for long time world
I Love much Music
it's make me vibe
14th July, 2023. There's noticeable temperature changes. The news warned us for the upcoming rise in temp, after the triple-dips.
The Boys are back!!! With the same boring shit as they always produce.
What a solo guitar. Amazing
All these years and still banging out bangers #respect
The Will Ferrell cameo was a little too long imo
Unpopular opionion: John leaving and coming back was the best thing that could have happened to the band. Constantly being pushed, and put in a situation they had to figure something new out. And when John comes back, all the bottled up creativity just explodes and you can feel the happiness.
Con sabor a Led Zeppelin buenazo
I shazamed this song, thinking it was an old red hot chili peppers song that I somehow missed. 1 year ago? It sounds like the old days.
Johns riffs  make the hair on my arm stand up!
Essa música é do Caralho!!!
This is by far the best RHCP tune yet.  And who knew John Wick played such a kick-ass guitar?!
Acabo de volver de verlos en directo en madrid y esta canción se quedo grabada en mi corazón ! Larga vida a RHCP!
Great song, soooo glad I finally saw them live at Werchter after being a fan for like 25 years!   Still not a fan of that moustache, Anthony.
Como é bom ouvir música boa! Viva o rock! 🤘
per me possono solo andare a zappare
Need another concert here in Florida please 😩🥺🔥🌶️🫶🎶

I heard somewhere recently that Anthony doesnt know how the band got so recognized because he doesn't think he's a good singer. I don't know if this is true or not, BUT, what is true is this man can SING! Red Hot Chili Peppers isn't just a band, they're a feeling. 😍🥰😍
This song is just 1yr old, and it feels like a classic already. AWESOME.
It's going to rain and RHTP make their magic again and all look prettier!!!
Diese Stimme 🙏
Having said this for many years, chad still looks like will ferell

Try hard to present actual but sometimes pursued by superstition brewing behind every gabble and juxtapose the archer's of on the run or you get filled darling, this is the ball keeps rolling surprised by the start waiting on another black summer to win, that holds evident the safety and passage of information debating the concept of age that suppose to let free the trap closing down riding on a passenger to crack the code to the weakness etching to bear the story of continual satisfaction can only win!
Waiting on another black summer to end
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes.
uffff como conecte con ese solo de frusciente¡
Bruh he's more buffed than half these 20 yr old artists nowadays.
Kudos to the RHCPs for doing a song and video about climate change - future generations will respect you for this!
Ok pero la parte de frusciante? ❤ojala hagan millenes de temas mas ❤❤❤
Look at them..John's chemistry..no one can replace.
Can't wait Steam in summer 😂
O chroma dos clipes do red hot são sempre muito bons! hahaha. Eu amo essa música. Espero vocês em novembro !!
🇺🇦
cool video
I just sadly had to cancel my tickets for the RHCP in both Spain and Portugal :( I'm a huge fan, have been for over a decade. Could someone please explain to me why Anthony adopted a Gaelic accent of sorts for this song. I maybe understand the reference, but it's very off-putting. No?
Los amo!❤
I love John.  They’re not the same without him
Omg these guys are the best
Goodๆๆๆ
Thankyou for staying to your usual sound. I really love it 🥺🖤
1:36 чё, с возрастом все становятся Джаггерами чтоле? 😂
I am listening to your songs whole life and i dont understand how good your songs are even after that long time. You started your band even before my birth but still, i love all your songs.   I want you to know that every fan of yours is in love with you all and dont stop.
❤❤❤soulmate❤❤❤
Гарна драйвова пісня 🤘🎸🤘
This guys are connected by some chemical stuff......awesome piece love the lyrics
I SWEAR That's WILL FERRELL ON THE drums!!!🤓🤓🤓
I Like John he seems like a dte Guy
0:39 у Фли на басу Владимир Ильич (Ленин)?
Matter of fact......frusciante IS  PURE MAGIC!!!!!!!! THIS ONE IS CLOSE TO BE A MASTERPIECE
Most of they're songs are about the plasma apocalypse
haaaaa camooon, fucking AWESOME!!!!!!!
2:30 amazing part of Johns living instrument
The goats
They always will be and always have been since creation alive in many different centuries and eons
Ladies and gentleman MR JHON FRUSCIANTE IS BACK!!!!
A reason why i love music
Espectacular!!!
Can you name any other band on the planet, that has been the number 1 drawcard, headlining act just about everywhere they have played, every festival, since 1989 and continue to fill stadiums and play top spot. If you think about it, this is one of those that we will probably never see again. The longevity of this band is mind-blowing..
love the guitar great sounds!
These guys are legendary
Una obra de arte, sin duda es de mis favoritas
Fruciante's falsetto will never get old
I love this kind of music, it reminds me of late 60s early 70s music, yet funky as hell like RHCP is known for. ❤❤ Welcome back John
I went to their concert recently and seeing this song live was a religious experience.   Like my mind went through all of my life’s tribulations and I came out with a new view on life.   The visuals as well were something else. I’ll forever have this memory in my heart, mind, and soul.  Thanks Red Hot Chilli Peppers, you guys are by far my favorite band.
Best song of all time
Tony has got the Cornwall accent down to a tee.. I hope you can see that I am trying, I know that I can do a hell of a lot better with all the crazy stupid things that I have let affect my mind.. I am trying my friends.. Lots of Love from the Blue Baby...
The wall. Big Pig balloons. Dark moons. Real flying pigs in the rafters. Best seats in the house🪜every chance i got
F.... me. This is just great.

Nice song
Black holes, she was born in Blackpool
If nobody asks, I do: beside the great music, how is Anthony maintaining such a good shape? He is 60 , but his body is only half of it 😀.

They just keep on making great songs.
novembro só vem 😍
Clicked article showing this and at 2:20 mark he does the okay symbol. I think I like the peppers and understand them, but I don't understand the artistic point of including the symbol.
Que los RHCP sean eternos.
Old but new genuine art
Isso é tao RHCP 🤙🤩
GG
This song reminds me of a bit of Jethro Tull's Aqualung
Meus meninos 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Ted Lasso 😂
John lowkey look like keanu reeves
Thankfully these dudes just don't quit.   Amazing band I've loved forever it seems.  All my favorites are gone except for a small handful.  I still can't believe Chris Cornell is gone.  Layne and Kurt both passed away on April 5th just different years.   My all time 2 favorites and April 5th just happens to be my birthday.
nice
Dios los bendiga por mantenerse tantos años con su identidad intacta!
He sounds like a pirte
Red hot con su identidad intacta! Magníficos
I love my chilis my only constant in a ever changing journey of life my one and only therapy!  Don’t like it when it’s used in a negative way to exploit experiences!   Back off please 🙏
Saw these guys last night they were amazing!!#Houston
Que bien le queda el bigote a Anthony!
Guitar solo: delicious
Рад что вы живы и здоровы, старички !
This song is just perfect

Dreaming about son to be different to find money in anywhere, better do not start the dream and watch movie and listen music.
High quality music!  I love it! Hola from Amarillo, TX 2:13
Such an amazing song! 🎧
Lmfao, i like the chili peppers , i really do. But Mike Patton and Faith No More will always kick their ass no matter how many albums they put out.😂
Is it just me or does this sound like “was I right or wrong” by lynyrd skynyrd?
I thought they're already done.. but I,m glad their music still packs the punch and can kick assess!
Je m'en laisserai jamais de ce grand groupe. Trop souvent sous côté....
I love these Men. Just saw them at the Alamodome. Ty I love you for coming to San Antonio. We love and appreciate your amazing show. The Strokes ❤Thundercat❤ ty, ty, ty I love y'all ❤ Y'all take care of yourselves too...🎵🎤got to make it rain somehow 🎶 I'm still on a high from your show. Good vibes ❤🤘💖🤠✌️
This song is not that new to me but i must say, this time I heard it might as well have been the first time I ever even heard RHCP. The thrill of the tribe is greater than ever before my friends.....so thankful !
I ❤🌶 RHCP
Il loro stile è unico!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am I on the same acid trip here. When I first watched this I swear it was like 10% less LSD vision. The song's still glorious but did I just look away?
Man after sometime treat you not good, friendship only can on the light for whole night, money and friendship , both also need. Father is business electricity and mother is cooking electricity, both also need for become them.
lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry, Я есть ленивый дождь, небо не прольёт слёз, Cremation takes its piece of your supply. Кремация отщипывает кусочек от твоих запасов. The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon, Ночь в наряде дня, моряк слишком рано открыл рот, And China's on the dark side of the moon. (Hear me now) А Китай на тёмной стороне луны. (Послушайте меня)   Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo, Утконосов можно сосчитать по пальцам, тайная жизнь Ру, A personality I never knew. (Get it on) Личность, которую я так и не узнал. (Вставай) My crater weighs a ton, the archer's on the run, Мой картер тянет на тонну, лучник пустился в бега, And no one stands alone behind the sun. И никто не встаёт один позади солнца.   It's been a long time since I made a new friend Давно я уже не заводил новых друзей, market.yandex.ru РЕКЛАМА Waitin' on another black summer to end, Всё ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето. It's been a long timе and you never know when Давно это было, уже не узнать когда, Waitin' on another black summer to end. Пока ждёшь, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.   Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship, Ударь огненным бичом, пройди под парусом по цензуре, Riding on a headless horse to make the trip. Пустись в путь на безголовом коне.   Been a long time since I made a new friend Давно я уже не заводил новых друзей, Waitin' on another black summer to end, Всё ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето. It's been a long timе and you never know when Давно это было, уже не узнать когда, Waitin' on another black summer to end. Пока ждёшь, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.   I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Я всё ждал, я всё ждал, Waitin' on another black summer to end. Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето. I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Я всё ждал, я всё ждал, Waitin' on another black summer to end. Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето. I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Я всё ждал, я всё ждал, Waitin' on another black summer to end. Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.
I wasn't sure about this song when I first heard it. It's grown on me.

Greatest Band on the Planet 🌎
Since my childhood and californication Album this band jist remains to be amazing. Just amazing group
not often can a guitar riff over take a flea bass line but this song is one of them. the bass is still epic tho just saying at least part of the song. i think im saying that right.
Vejo em Novembro em Curitiba
Queria muito realizar o meu sonho de ir no show do RHCP, mas infelizmente não consegui comprar o ingresso para o show que vai ter aqui em SP! 😢
So cool
Excelente canción
❤❤
the  ninja fruit in the hostel was from you haha
Chilli peppers are one of my favorites. Their music has such a nice vibe.

love rhcp
stop sending racist to me please byebye
Na mão te dão difícil dizer não 😱 sei que estes caras são lutadores e vencedores 👏
When everyone getting older, they treat thing even more serious.
Hello Tony, Flea, John and Chad hope you are all well. Can you blame me for wanting to get away from this area. It hasn't felt like home for a longtime and I don't think it ever will again. There was another shooting in USA. Why all the bloody guns? It's crazy.
Consistency TunZ
this is Beautiful

Hey, simple jack!!
💚🧲MT MAGEDD0N A88AD0N S0L0? WAR3 U BR3DWR3N? D1V31N®️💚
these guys can take the most traumatising horrifying moments in history and makes the most inspirational songs you will never forget. i say that because this song in part  was about the Australian wild fires of 2019 that was so bad that in some parts you could not tell day from night with how bright the fires burned, as well as the lead singer's own personal fears of making new friends in fear of loosing them.
Should change their name to CRAP
Jonathan wick play guitar he’s so cool 😮
🟥🔥🌶🫑
Cachuma iz boiling over early 68:,zumajay
Holy crap.. they are wearing shirts!!
GREAT SONG AND GREAT BAND
I've been jamming these guys ever since I heard under the bridge when I was 6 I'm Now 37
What a hit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You need to play grunge
John wick playing guitar
2:02 Anthony running like in Under the Bridge just in the opposite direction 🤣
❤
Why is this the first time I heard this?
Good music, idiotic lyrics
I love the word clouds. Give my love to the band. Don't hold your breath too long. Thank you for the birthday presents. Tres Leches.
This is a fuckn Jam!!! Hard to love new music from great artists after so long but this shit hits!!!
❤
Love Anthony Kiedis nikes ande sgiedes manes and fierldies uhh she eensennsnses.
Holy shit, Anthony is 60 years old and looks like that. Damn.
Temón ❤.
Retorné nuevamente grandes entre todo los grandes retornas en los buenos pensamiento
when I hear John play guitar I feel myself a better person
For those who were like between 12-16 yrs old when songs like under the bridge and give it away came out…we’ll probably be like getting lost in peace while listening to this loving every part of it especially the part where they still stick to their genre and not cater to the modern day electronic shit music
I'm listening
Why does anthony keidis look more an more like skinny pete from breaking bad
The best ❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VqH0X7Vx8
This music is very crazy 🎸🤟🤟🤟
Fucking love this band forever!
0:38 Anthony Kiedis sounding like an Irishman - "durkside" :P
Respect to Anthony for being ripped as hell at his age.
Cachuma iz full helo
Been a long time since I made a new friend. Waiting for another black summer to end. Priceless reality.
Esto se merece muchas más vistas que obra

Thanks God for a wonderfull music never though to hear again!!!!! John frusciante makes all the diference!!!! Viva RHCP!!!!!!!!!
Es uno de mi grupo favorito escucho todas sus canciones desde sus comienso, es mas soy rokero
Como eu amo essa banda brasil🇧🇷❤
Man, John's like a spittin' image of Keannu Reeves in this clip!
one of the few bands that come out with new music and people actually show up to hear it instead of waiting for the oldie encore
This is a good song.👍
Nunca me cansarei desse vídeo.
Will Ferrell on the drums yall
his movements are weird as fuck
This is incredible. It is art. They put their heart and soul into it man. That's what differentiates them from most of the wack musicians of this generation
MCO
...this group music/sound, fuck me so badly. It takes me back to my college years ...that I loved and yearn so much for....😢
Jooohn no te vayas nunca de los rhcp
POV escuchas esta cancion  que bendicion😎😲😎😎😎😎😃
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Awesome
I fucking love it 🔥
Is this video a JOKE??? WTF
Will Farrell is a hell of a drummer
John wick can play the hell out of that guitar
Really digging the Jethro Tull vibe
Ta joia 👍
All Red Hot Chilli Peppers: Look Elder. John:👶
Is that John Frusciante!!???!!!
Lpm que vale la pena estar vivo!!! Nos vemos en river 2023!!
Red Hot Chili Peppers - Black Summer
Happy 1 year of the album release ! 🌶✳
Wonderful
eargasms...Flea is a beast
Estan como el vino añejo mejor a como pasan los años y el solo de frusciante tiene como un tono parecido a los solos de jimmy Hendrix epico y memorable
A modern classic with ethereal quality musically and lyrically. Boys are blessed with longevity and skill.
The eyes @3:00
Been on an overdue rhcp kick lately. Heard this and thought it must have been one of the 90s classics. Then i realized this is fresh. Rock and roll lives, thank god.
Argentina 26/11 Like!! estadio river
Anthony Kiesis doing his best impression of the “Dancing Guy” from always sunny.
Seriously one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard. The lyrics, in particular… my God.
Amazing band!! Frusciante guitar sound, Amazing. One of the best bands ever. Period! and also one of the best bands to see live on stage!!
is so fucking good !!
The guys are rocking like never before 👏👏👏
Love the classics don’t get me wrong. But when they played this song live at soldier field last year my spirit started to float oust side of my body 😭
💜🤘🏾
divo!! amei o high note
02:50

Parece uma música em 432hz é muito soante!
Been a fan since around 94, You guys still bring it!
Amo vocês, obrigado
Please, coloquem o Jhon fazendo o solo Dream Californication in Live at Castle Slane
It’s gotta be “My Crater” not “My Greta” lol
I cannot believe the Chilli Peppers have created something so awesome.  It feels like they're just getting started.
Man this is good stuff
La mejor banda del mundo de los últimos tiempos señoras y señores!! RHCP 🌶
IM WAITING STILL
For those of us who were wondering what band would be the next Rolling Stones or Aerosmith in terms of relevant longevity, let me present the #1 Contender. I would say that they might be the best of that bunch too.
Epic❤❤
Simply perfect! thanks guys 🤘🤘🤘
That solo is so satisfying
Wau, I cant believe you are in so good form guys. You are perfect. I love you
This is literally the best song of all time!
Perfeito
Amazing band! Unrepeatable.
Why is Anthony Irish now lmao😅
Salah satu lagu terbaik yang pernah ada black summer
You guys rock fav band ever if I could get a comment back from flea anotonhy John and Chad
Beautiful band I love them ❤❤
On 2 July I'll be in Milan for the first Peppers' concert of my life 🤩 In the meanwhile, I am listening to Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen and love some songs soooooo much 😍Music will never disappoint me _ long live the Peppers 🤟🤟🤟💥❤️‍🔥 greetings from Italy 💋🌹
Long live Jimi Hendrix
Am I the only one who thinks this would be the perfect theme song for GTA 6?

Não vejo a hora de ouvir Black Summer em Curitiba/23 🌶️
la mejor banda de mi infancia
After all these years RHCP made a song to commemorate Woodstock 99
GREAT REDHOT CHILLI PEPPERS
Love 💗💗 the song . All time great Artist
最高😢😢
Mn esse baixo e a guitarra, perfeito!
Não vejo a hora de ouvir essa música no show em São Paulo em novembro.
I still can't believe that I found out that RHCP is still making music because of this song being in Fortnite's car radio last year
São como vinho S2
I'm 39 and have loved these guys since I was a baby. Soundtrack to my whole life, they are all so freaking awesome!! 🥰👌
You got to go where it is raining
Chega logooo 07 de novembrooo
In a very lucid comment, someone observed with amazement that this Band is capable of preserving its essence in its music.  How is it possible that after so many years in the musical Market, those who control this circus have not yet absorbed its creative energy?  What is the secret?  Perhaps they have superhuman superpowers?  It seems that their existential joy, their passion for life in the present moment, keeps them safe from those very olds vampires.  Thanks! Long live the spirit of Red Hot Chili Peppers!  🤘
Queria ser o mamilo do Anthony.... Para estar sempre perto do coração dele!
🇧🇷 2023
Anyone else think Anthony Kiedis looks like Eddie Gurrerro in this?
8/03/2023 21:00 i love you my chicken lu v:  <3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

Que bonita canción pasan los años y sus voces siguen iguales
❤️
red hot chili peppers вы лучшие!!!❤❤❤
John wick on a guitar ♥️♥️🔥🔥
Bravi 😁👍👍
It feels like he’s talking directly to me: this is the song that got me hooked
Fanfuckingtastic
Como o AK é perfeito, amor platônico de décadas 💘. RHCP é a melhor banda do mundo 🌎
The lyrics make no sense? 😂 I love red hot chili peppers. But people will listen to anything.. 😂
Frusciante is genius, but i dont like that he goes to pop funk not heavy hard funk psychodelic, he back to rhcp couple times, so now i would like to see Dave Navarro back. OHM is so fucking best. Frusciante is so jelous he thought that nobody can keep rhcp without him, but he was wrong, thats why he does not play navarros great songs... so sad
Guitar - John Wick Drums - Will Ferrel Vocal - Matilda Wormwood(Honey) with mustache  just kidding... RHCP is awesome!
Will Ferrell on the drums.. love it..
The old guys still kicking arse!
Good.
so, does he just hate shirts.   I guess that makes sense, he kinda buff.
:)
Seriously....  What is up with Anthony's haircuts? Haha. His forehead is far too beautiful to hide.
Cool
One year and 24 years ago it was being released and I still can't believe we got Frusciante back. An amazing moment to be alive.
pedas !
if you ever dream of playing guitar..john frusciante is the man to learn from! Life lessons, and guitar lessons!
Anthony es mi novio y mi novio lo sabe 🫦💋
AK  your voice sounds beautiful on this
Looks good for 60
Как классно что Фрусчанте вернулся. Перцы стали звучат как раньше по своему. Вечно молодые 😁😁
these guys are aging like the finest wine, I love you thank you
The Chili Peppers have gotten me through middle school, high school, the pain of losing loved ones, addiction, recovery, and countless nights both good and bad. Their music and stories have, at times, been the only thing that kept me going. They’re music has been the soundtrack to some of my best and worst moments. Kiedis’ words of pain and anguish gave me hope as I laid in bed sicker than I’d ever been trying (and succeeding, thank God) to kick addiction and his words have imprinted in some of my fondest memories as their music played in the background of summer nights and great times spent with the people I love and care about most in this world, especially those who are no longer on this planet.  I fell in love with them as a kid when I my buddy’s older brother played the Californication CD, devoured their past work, and immediately bought every album they released (including skipping school after lunch in 2006 to race to the Tower Records off of PCH to make sure I grabbed Stadium Arcadium). It’s amazing how this band means so much to so many different people and yet the music manages to touch us in a unique way. I love all sorts of music and have many “favorite” bands and artists but none will ever resonate so deeply in my soul like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. God bless them.  I don’t expect anyone to read this but it felt nice to type all of this out anonymously in a comment section. Maybe it’s because I rarely talk about my past struggles or maybe it’s because I don’t know how to fully articulate this band’s impact without sounding crazy or maybe it’s because a comment section is cheaper than therapy. All I know is that this music has lifted me up and kept me going from the days of CD players on the bus to middle school to today and for that I’m eternally grateful.
Glad for the original sound welcome back john
I love blak summer ❤
Very stupid song.
On April 8th, how can you be in Brighton UK and Minneapolis MN at the same time ?
This is one of the last true bands, however many years later and they are still putting out art like this 👏
This ancient hippie likes
xdddd
Rick
j'ai pas de mots, c'est très beau, merci 🤩💓🙏
Best song they ever made if you have to listen to the radiografía
A este tema le pondría de género grunge funky
I dreamed about this song just 5 minutes ago. Just woke up lol. Catchy ass song
I love red hot chili peppers 🌶
I was today years old when I found out this band started in 1983!  That is insane!
One year ago I heard this song while my runners high kicked in looking at the winter sky . This music video is perfect and exactly how it looked/and felt
will ferrel is so talented
2024 music
2023 music
😍😍😍😍🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
The lead guitarist looks alot like Keanu Reeves! Lol
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums like always, and how bout Joe Exotic as the front man
Best Frusciante solo ever
Круто
Black Summer will come back like Karma or a Bummerang, metaphorically speaking. Watch out guys. The Hit will be painful 😂
Love it I have been listening to it for years
AK, love that swagger BTW great song
Just casually playing this amazing song on repeat throughout the day it really keeps me going 😁
The best song of all times
Thank you Rhcp for being true to yourselves, your fans and especially your music. Anthony, you wear that mullet like no one I've ever seen !!

Fecking hell I love this tune. Sending massive love from Ireland 🇮🇪

melhor msc deles dps d veinhos
These guys don't miss. Thanks for being an intricate part of my youth guys. You're beloved
Man the whole song just takes me back to the 90s.
Every Hendrixy. Definitely the uni vibe is on. Sounds like Jimi's "Hey Baby."
Thank you for sharing this for me. Nothing else.
Las únicas banda de los 2000s que se han mantenido juntas y son mis favoritas son Green Day, Coldplay, Paramore y los Chilli Peppers 🐢
Amazing boys, love your new stuff 😊
Blackie & Mench are looking down at us Your move Spaghetti Getty Love CA Mensch

this song came out one month into my then new job one year later, and this takes me back to all that excitement not to mention that, to me, this is one of those "instant classics"
1:53 quem não começou a chorar assistindo isso aqui pela primeira vez quando o John começou a solar é maluco
This is all gas no brakes ❤ 🕺🏼. I love that Frusciante is back 🌶️ 🔥 🤘
It's been 01 year and I never get tired of Black Summerrrrr
These colors... <3
Great sounding song, I love it. But what the hell are some of these lyrics?!
Has anybody ever fallen in love with someone through music ??I seriously think Anthony K is the most beautiful soul in the world.❤
The SeCreT Life of... Snoo?!💚
0:45 ❤️‍🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
un año 💜💜💜
Fuckyea 🤟
El cuerpazo de Kiedis 🫣🫠🤤 Baboseos aparte, genial grupo,temazo y espero poder volver a verlos este año en directo ❤❤
Amazing song, juat shows you how good they are
1:50
This was great to listen to live in Sydney. Shame the rest of the show was sub average though.
Отличное произведение!
Get this to 50 million views
isn't this a Jethro Tull melody?!
Wow.. 😳 mullets 😂
it will always be in my memory my first time watching this clip with all the band reunited, i just love rhcp in so many ways
One year of this song ❤️
this song is just amazing
❤️
John somehow looks like Keanu in those first few shots ahaha
a year has passed since launch, has time flown by for you too?
How is this already a year ago ?!!!
Lipo might be, yes. Lol 🤘 For marriage purpose’s, after Spoused, yes. 😌
Antony has the best hair piece in all of entertainment - and that counts for a lot.   However, what the fuck is he wearing in this? Half expecting the lyrics to be "Not now, Kato, my little yellow friend!"  as Bert Kwok causes chaos on screen.
easily one of the worst rhcp songs ever made
One year ago 🖤❤🖤❤🖤
Más de 35 años después y aún siguen haciendo esto?! Haciendo lo que aman y lo que amamos sus verdaderos fans, para esto nacieron Peppers y en este sonido son únicos❤️🫶🏼💋  Es increíble que sigan siendo los mismos🥹
ONE YEAR AGO TODAY !!! <3
🤘🏿😎
I really hope they win for Best Rock Song at the Grammys
RHCP forever.
Why this moustache? Oh No Tony, NO!!
Man these guys still rock and sound the same from when I first herd them on the radio as a 15 yr teenager back in 1991. 👍
Ya un año :0
RHCP FOR LIFE!!!
🖤🖤
Californication con otra letra....
Today marks one year of this great theme
Love this song
1 YEAR AGO... :")
https://youtu.be/I0uNyjqgAHM
Frusciante is the closest to Hendrix since Hendrix. King of triads
Se cumple 1 año del regreso ❤
Can't believe it's been a year already
Wow... One entire fucking year since this masterpiece was released. I could never tell.
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
1 ano. ❤️
ONE YEAR OF BLACK SUMMER
It's been a year already, and this song is now one of their new classics!!
here's to 1 year of black summer! 🖤
One year anniversary! Such an amazing event to see a band like this return.
It’s crazy to think that they’re in their 50s and 60s
Need serious acid to enjoy this shit.
Never change great music. They are the trend no matter the year
Luke Warm Chili Peppers.   God I miss Blood Sugar Sex Magick RHCP
Hot as ever!💜
Godbless RHCP 💘
Red Hot é simplesmente foda! Amo esses caras!❤
Baita som
Yup yup
Majestic song .Saludos desde Argentina .FAN de rhcp desde siempre!!
Majestic song , saludos desde Argentina!! fan de ustedes desde siempre!!
If I didn't know better, I'd say he had some Irish in his blood just by the way he says certain words. Like dark sounds as "derk".
I love Frusciante's old Stratocasters. He's an awesome musician but also has a great taste for guitars.
Love it ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
wooooow❤‍🔥
It’s crazy to think this video was shot in front of a GIANT LED wall…
Man Justin Long's singing is on point
Red hot chili peppers inside of every hole all day please
So much better with John
😍😍💚😘😘🥰🥰
Estos chicos nunca jamás van a envejecer, porque soy los elaboradores de las pócimas del mismísimo Dorian Gray 😎
They’re back with that old sound holy moly instant favourite
Never been a fan of R.H.C.P but this song got me so bad....loved it. ... After All.these years I am so glad that they still can perform..
Awesome band 💗💗💗💗👍👍👍👍👍
still one of the best Bands of all time!
The greatest band since the Beatles  love these guys
Isn’t it amazing how after so many years RHCP still sucks balls?
i saw you outside yesterday
I never would have thought this was a song from 2022, it sounds just like the stuff they made in the 90s and 00s.
Casting 4dungieezz
“It’s been a long time since I’ve made a new friend “ damn that’s deep😢😕
Sooooo good! Their last album The Getaway i absolutely loved, but it sounded new - like a more modern version of the Chillis. But this shit, wow, sounds like it came straight of the 90's. love it.
Wow! Just about their best song.
So Nostalgic. ❤️‍🔥
Cat is playing "narkotik" by "likwido".
Just experienced this live what a show what a set list dunners got spoiled!
This song will go down as an all time great Can't wait to come back to this comment section after a decade
You guys kill it every time!🤘🏻🖤 This is..🔥❤️‍🔥
SQUEALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
« And China’s on the DIRK side on the moon 😂😂
Jebacki predobra!❤️
He looks like 30 not 60
This screams '90s and early 2000s. PRICELESS!
Oh my god what power red hot!!!!
2:32
I love this song but I keep seeing Joe Exotic when I look at Anthony
Grammy nominated song 🙏
wow I didn't know Stefanos Tsitsipas could play guitar!
Still shirtless after all these years. Man's definitely from Homewood lmao.
It's insane how good this band STILL is.  I feel blessed to be able to still hear Antony, John, Flea and Chad putting together such great music after 30+ years.  RHCP is simply legendary.
John 🤟
Anthony get rid of your mustache it makes you look old.
RHCP makes my blood boil, my brain melt and my balls squeak at the same time
This song is so damn good
the top🤟✌🤙🙏
John frusciante
This is wonderful. Interestingly at points it reminds me of Riders on the Storm.
Chad and his goddamned jumpsuits...I see you MOFO!!!!
China is on the dark side of the moon 🤔
That mo’stache is playin aarrpp
Qué solo mas fresco tiro el bueno de Frusciante, gracias por seguir haciendo música en estos tiempos de mierda
Man, Will Ferrell really outdoes himself on those drums.
These guys, and tool, are my all time faves. And they have stayed true to their flavour. It gives me hope.
josh era melhor
Antony my love for ever 💖
The XXI S. Rolling Stones
John Frusciante <3 Stay healthy brother!
I got heavy Hendrix vibes from this part 0:46 Frusciante, legend as always
Anthony sem camisa é um deleite aos meus olhos . Minha banda preferida,  amooooo!!!!!
el solo es orgásmico
This sounds like an unreleased song from californication
Great song, and glad John returned. But I have to have to say it is deeply depressing to see not one comment (I’m not going scroll down the entire list. There might be a few) about what the song is about, the climate crisis, wildfires, cars and fossil fuel dependency. It was the same with the recent Muse song “We Are Fing F’d”. No one talked about what the lyrics are highlighting.
Whoa, I just went to listen to best of RHCP while working and found this piece of art! Love to see John here! What a banger. Seeing them performing live is on my bucket list. Hope everybody's having a great day
get rid of the gay porno mustache
Always Great love from Bangladesh
They should upload this.
Fuckyeh the last two song iv seen this is my favourite now
Actually blew a speaker!
Is just me or does Anthony has an Eddy Guerrero vibe going on here?
Been a fan since the 2000s and they still have the same vibe 🤘🤘
Блин какие же вы уже старенькие((( но такие офигенные, спасибо RHCP за то что вы были, есть и будите!)🤘🎸
What is R.H.C.P. without Frusciante??? Fantastic number....
This and She's a Lover.... Took me a long time to determine my two favorite off this album...
The solo is kind of Kurt Cobain Blew , I love it .
Mannnn you can't deny the effect of Frusciante returning. Every time! THEY DONE DID IT AGAIN! This solo is B-E-A-UTIFUL too! Been stuck in my head for DAYS. Randomly played a few notes of it messing around on guitar and had to learn the song! Lol Constant inspiration from these guys
Frusciante the best!❤️
Redthot never died!
Best thing that happened in 2022..
This belongs in a dumpster
Am I the only one hearing a little bit of R.E.M. echoes in the chorus? Good to see and to hear these gentlemen's playing together, a good song, in my opinion.
They looks like Danny Trejo, Keanu Reeves and old Arny. I love you guys
This Solo is so awesome 🎸🤙🏻🤘🏻
this man look like a punisher
See I am a fighter
No puedo parar de escucharla ..! Ojalá vengan a Ecuador 🇪🇨 sus letras su música Justo en el momento cuando uno más los necesita ..!
That moment ❤️🤩🤘❤️🤩🤘❤️🤩🤘❤️🤩❤️  https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEcAxD15S9izDp8Ntx97_jfA9Syxq6Q3q
mon groupe preferer..... j adore
Mó fã gordo theka
I love guitar solo!!
Why doesn't Frusciante play the solo live like he did here on the studio version?
I love Frusciante, and the band is one of my fav. But all songs are the same. After 30 minutes listening the album I was already tired.
Great solo John Frusciante 🔥🔥🔥
My God he looks like a brunette tiger king Doen't any one of you fans see iy?
pure l a
the best of RHCP .... ever
It's funny a liberal talking about a, "censor" ship, isn't it?
temazo
My skin bristles every time i listen this music, beautiful feeling <3
With the state of music right now, all the horrible bands, I thank God for RHCP. John Frusciante makes me want to play my guitar again. 🎸
The KROQ anthem 😂
No hay ninguna duda, sin john frusciante, los red hot no existen, que bueno que volvio🤘🤘🎸🎸
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥇❤🏆
Drummer looks like Will Ferrell
bro this should have been the background music for when rick blows up the bridge in season 9
This is now my new favorite karaoke song!
This band is still really good 👍🏽. I found it funny that the microphone stand keeps moving in the last half of the video.
HAPPY NEW YEAR'S MY FRIENDS LOVE YOU RHCP REALLY NICE ❤️ LOVE THE MUSIC 🎶 🎵 UNBELIEVABLE THANKS LORETTA AND THE WORLD 🌎
John Frusciante 😍
That wicked 'stache though.
Is that drummer will ferrells dad?
Это шедевр .
She's entreated through the realm of star conquest.
Nossa Eles Voltaram que Massa isso !! Agora com Formação Original   que Legal Eles são Igual vinho Só Melhora com Tempo. Jonh Frusciante que Guitarrista Genial Ele da um Toque mágico na Banda 👏👏
What's wild about this band is that each member is like a hall of famer at their own thing.  Flea is an icon,  and a bass pioneer.  John Frusciante is one of the greatest guitarists alive,  although he rarely shows off,  he's absolutely incredible. Plus Will Farrell is one of the greatest comedians ever.
dudes 60 years old crushing it.
happy new year
It blows my mind with how old this band is yet they still are relevant and still are pumping out amazing music.
Песня бомба!!!!! Поеду их слушать в Милан 2023-м.
Amazing song just when im lose it this make me feel better
video probably cost $100 to make
ayo this shit sucks lol
larga vida
Thank you for sticking around mr frusciante.
This song is like having a hippie uncle get too high and starts mumbling cryptic life lesions to you.
Victimisation of Black People..  To easy. To short. God s playin with wokism
As long as John fruciante is playing they stay amazing the harmony is my favorite, together they are brilliant but for some reason I only enjoy a couple of songs when someone else is filling in for JF.
It’s April, 2022. This video uploads and at 2:09 you realize it’s not just a dream. This video will forever be the Californication Video of Era 3. With 00:48 echoing the moment John is first seen with his strat and 2:09 The moment you realized something you had hoped, but doubted, really came true
Will Farrell is the drummer?
LOL these guys look 75 years old
Anthony's mustache sang 35% of this song.
John, is a guitar god.
Your pretty amazing But, is there a Veronica video Just wondering Anthony ????? Merry Happy Holidays Christmas lol but anyhow, I can't find one... But Your Black summer Is extremely espectional my spellingsuckstoday anyways Keep doing U ..... Your music is Amazing!
Na sintonia entre eles a essência permanente continua fluindo,  esses caras entendem isso , que bom para nós e para eles também!!
Sou louca no Jhon Frusciante. ❤️
Damn, another frusciante guitar solo that gave me goosebumps.
hehe rhcp since i'm a kid Anthony Kiedis?People Will have one day to admit that he revolutionised the way flows were made in punk rock alternative music...and you can see alot of rapper or wtv making theyre flowz littéralement being the song tempo...saccadé rythmé......but high vibrating spirit for this universe  for those who can vibe to and see

Great song terrible haircut.... Love RHCP THO.
The flow is so groovy
Red Hot, I love you so much!!!!!!!!
💚💚💚💚
What's happened to Anthony's voice? Doing strange things with his pronouciation and his voice is bloody awful live. Listen to Dani California @ Manchester Apollo, in and out of tune, almost unrecognisable, sounds very forced.. Also this song is so much likke Slow Cheetah....
John wick?
Red Hot é Red Hot, simplesmente fantástico!!!!
Amazing
Theyre just THAT amazing
Слухаю зараз і так кайфую, наче тоді, років 20 назад
God damn almost made me teary eyed
that frickin solo at 1:52, I could listen to that for the rest of my life
When I listen to Chili Peppers I feel on cloud nine.🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Angela suetkamp shrock
ahh my LSD days, where I saw pink elephants flying on my acid trip.
Should 've came out with the iconic "Socks".That would shake things up.
Best rock band of actuality 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Lead vocalist was on epsteins list.
Song about climate change, really good.
Same shit
God I love rhcp lol

John Wick's guitar part is amazing!!!!!
Punkrock mba makes me laugh when he talks about this song 😆 why does he have a Irish accent?
FRUSCIANTE
I really got into them around ‘91 through my high school boyfriend…amazing that they’re still jamming 🙏
best song of 2022. that's it.
Thank you to a real American band god bless you and Aaron Lewis
0:42 1:50 3:07
This sounds kinda cringe ngl  And whats up with Anthony's new Irish accent
Ahhh yes yes, de dERp seid
Garbage. From music, his voice, image, moves... 🤦🏼‍♂️
You guys make it work....... punky
Sounds like bad company song by bad company mixed with the Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe
Amazing song
Oh I'll be your friend! 🤣
vem logo para o Brasil!
This shit is cringe, never liked the Peppers
😘
Make it sound like I'm trying to get rid of anthony  but I Love him.
Music to the Soul!! The guys are unreal, I'm a person who appreciates all walks of music and truly like songs not genres. Most of there songs just hit different not many groups like these guys!!
Love that guitar at 0.48
👍❤️เยี่ยม
🌈💚🌈💚🌈🌈💚
once again the pairing Flea + Frusciante proves to be legendary
If you only listen to the bass line of this whole song, you will still be impressed.
Love this band since the  beginning and shit man credit where it's due seen them a lifetime  ago in Ireland alife time ago and still to this day get as good as it gets......respect...T.R.H.C.P.......from 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧....THANKS. TO YALL FANZ U GET IT FOR SURE....
see you in Warsaw!
The greats time traveled and had them a jam sessions through some gr8z! #StarSeedTingZ
Tell me that ain’t John Bernthal
If Woodstock, was in 2020...The Red Hot Chili Peppers, would be charged by Democrats for Sedition. Think-about-that when ya applaud those looney Democrats.
i love you anthony, i won't forget you. love from melissa meyer age 43.  xoxoxox
.
The drummer looks like Will Ferrel!
Welcome back
Oh my gosh! My favorite song in the world right now.
Sempre ❤
So glad John's back.
Wuooooo y de nuevo con John Frusciante 🔥🔥🔥
My best friend is 59 and as kids used to go skating boarding with flea..aka Micheal Balzary back then circa 76 in West Hollywood...said Flea was a blast and used to bring his trumpet and play it as they skated...that he was really good on the trumpet....good times.
and thank you
i cry  out of my self doings, as, winnings, watchings, back again  remembering yesterdays, passing, history and its,  not always,  the sinning,  that worries,  me it
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Music is great but why he singing like that haha sounds like an american trying to do an Irish pirate
Please stop. Amazing musicians, horrible vocals per usual. Straining to hit meaningful notes. . Less obvious this track but it's time to hang it up or start new projects
Who is this band??
Red hot..for eternity.....
If you like John Frusciante's fingerwork, then you might enjoy the guitars on this track: https://youtu.be/losgpvvRR24
0:45 ✅✅✅✅✅
Perfect sounds
i grow up watching them, now i watch them growing old and still amazing .. music never gets old
This sounds like we are in 1989
My favorite song right now they still have that funky sound
Rachel sends her devine retro love, Shiva says in it
That's legendary
Great!!!
Anthony goes full on "CANADIAN PASSPORT" in this one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song is in rotation on the radio station I listen to. It’s my introduction to the band. It took a few listens but now I’m big into it.
they never seem to disappoint
Un kiff total 👍😋🎶🎸🎸🎸
10 seconds in paradise: 0:46
Yaaaaah!!!! Frusciante is back!!!! RHCP are back!!!!!!! 😍
You can see their aura throughout the video
God he's so ripped after all these years still!!
Thumbs up for making some good music during a hard time
The best song of all time!
Please come to Lithuania Red Hot Chili Peppers again. Please please please 🤗🙏
Frusciante baby..RHCP.
Great song.  But what's with the Irish accent.  Oh no.  Well what would a Chili Peppers song be without massive affectation on the vocals.  That guitarist still kills.  Crazy bastard.
How i can do two likes?
Can't get my head around the lyrics.
Ja,so müssen sich die RHSP'ers🌶anhören 🥳🤘
bring da funk everywhere i go
I can't believe they got Will Ferrell to play drums
Aw man, they're gonna use up all the good chord progressions.
The fact that I heard this song on the AMA’s it really got into my heart I am in love with this song
They played this song when I saw them at the Rodgers Center, what a great performance 👏
A sad part is that i used to dislike them in my childhood and adolescence. They seemed too boring to me and i never appreciated John's solos lol😂. Now  as i age i understand that they're high above other modern bands. Quality, rhythm, guitar, drums are on absolutely another level. It's like one has to be mature enough to comprehend and start valuing it. Glad they're still making music.
What could be better? Nobody and nothing
I remember reading "Come as You Are," the story of Nirvana back in the mid-90s, and the author ripped the Peppers for having no original material. 28 years later, they are still going. They are still going after another lifetime of years that Kurt Cobain lived. Amazing.
RHCP is just timeless
❤️
Ain't no one convincing me it's not Jon Bernthal with a porno stache.
Name
His new is fatheD
To be still relevant with all those years behind you for a band is remarkable, very few bands can say that
Idk wtf fuck he’s talking about but that guitar solo was amazing.
love this song
LOS AMO
Only few disperate  things didn t change in the last 30 years. Red hot's sound is one of them. Thank you guys. Since when I was 14 years old I listen you. Today I m almost 36.
Red Hot puro!
Que música!
Did the Chicago Soldier Field show..August 2022. Outstanding  !!
They kind of fell off in my opinion
q grandioso cheeeeeee asombroso perfecto muy buenooooo
Ya vengan a Perú por favor 🥺🇵🇪💕
This is simply amazing!!! Give 2022 some hope！🖤
Oh ! Quelle belle musique
A band that's never disappointed me lyrically,  musically and live in concert. ❤🙌❤
These lads are looking old now
recuerdo que tenia 13 años y por primera vez escuche a estos ídolos. Mi vida cambio y ame el rock desde ese entonces.
I wish my mom was still here to listen to this! She showed me r.h.c.p. when I was a kid and I've been a huge fan ever since Just like her. R.i.p. mom love you
Love Keanu Reeves on the guitar and Will Ferrel on the bass

Even tho they look different since the days of Dani California there music does not change
Nothing better than a Good tune to lift the spirit up!!! 🤘🤘🤘👹🙈👺🙏🙏🙏
It's so wholesome to see Will Ferrell playing the drums like a god
So glad their healthy. God bless great music . Grew up on these guys . This song is is RAD ! Love it
2:11 did he just dab?
охуенно ...
De repente el sonido me trajo a la canción. Que bien!!
Satanic rituals and music
THANK YOU FOR EXISTING. <3
To John: Thankyou for everything! And welcome back, I hope you are happy and cool now since it might have been hard for you last years... To Flee: Earth should bless you for the energy you are able to make others feel! You love it, We love you! To Chad: The Rock! The Secret master!  You have always been working in the shadow to bring RHCP to bright lights. To Anthony: Congratulation for improving your vocalisms :P Nah I'm joking, you are awesome! The feeling of self-confidence you blow have always been my inspiration!  To Josh, and everyone of you: You guys have just changed our lifes. I feel like you really wish to give something through your songs. And, Fuck, how rare is it nowadays?   Just keep on going and die doing it! Please!  PS:Actually, you have given us so much that you definitely deserve to give to yours! If this is what you wish...Thank you for everything! We will always remember.
I still can't believe how much Chad looks like Will Ferrell. Crazy that there both famous too
THANK YOU BAND
❤️
does he never have any t-shirt?
Why Frusciante doesn't he age?
This song made me a rhcp fan a year ago ,since then I listened to stadium Arcadium ,blood sugar sex money ,californication ,freaky stylez and the 2 albums from this year and I can Say in a 1 year period they became one of my favourite bands alongside other bands
I'll miss Josh Klinghoffer but it's good to have John back.
The only band standing in this era!
Musik kesukaan saya❤
peeps hairdoooo
Eu amo tanto o John 💜💜💜💜💜cara que perfeição. .agora sim o Red Hot voltou!!!
Greta 👎
Now I know what Uncle Rico is doing
It's nice to see Will Ferrell do what he does best lol
stop with nostalgy
Flea's antics always brings a smile to my face!  They sound great!  They are my generation's Rolling Stones, like the Stones they'll still be rocking the stage better than anybody long after we are all dead!
They're back, baby!
I Will see you in vive latino 2023!! 🇲🇽
Ma jeunesse... 😁
His shirt went shoom!
China is not on the MOON you freaking idiot. It's on earth, Asia to be more specific.
Dang your lyrics are so deep and great most people will never understand but for one freaking song could you just keep the slow deep rhythm going it always goes fast and hard which I’m not complying but for just one song keep it soft to even not hard lol
I will never get tired of this
It’s been nine months already ❤️ life.
Enfin!!! 👍👍👍👍🙏
Rhcptopbgt
love how the video is almost the same as under the bridge video
I love your new album
💕
temazo pollo

The guitar sound is so stoner rockish...just love it !!!!
HITS...main arteries...always growing...
Bravo et merci a vous 😉
Striking soul
Like the Rolling Stone, Red Hot Chili Peppers are going to last forever.
Feels like a rhcp history lesson...
Iconic

Bad song
I love these guys so much!!! They remain true to their music!
Anthony  so much hotter with long hair and no mustache
One of the best bands ever!

порядочный трек! Годный! где кнопка как у агутина "в плейлист нахуй!"?
I feel like Unlimited Love could have just been called Black Summer
Восхитительно!!!!!
Rock and roll isn't dead, it's just getting old.
Love it!
Blood sugar sex magic will always be number 1!
Anthony is the best singer in the world 🌎 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I just love it soomuch you guys mean so much to me❤

I've fallen in love with this band thanks to this song. Amazing one, really good job guys!
0:42 - John saying, just in case u thought i forgot about my guy Jimi - here.
Were lucky John Frusciante is still with us , and back in his rightful place in the band , no disrespect to Josh
most underwhelming, bland, and formulaic song
OMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Amo e não é pouco❤️
So love this song.

Pour moi cette chanson est devenue un grand classique et le restera très longtemps, this song is a big classical and will last forever
QUE TEMANGA VIEJO LO MEJOR DE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
Crazy that the Peppers are coming up on 40 years.  They still have an uninhibited youthful vibe after all of their saddle time.
So tight and right the older we get the better we play ❤️🎼😸😘
por esto, RHCP es la mejor banda que existe <3
This songs hits hard
i love this
After Hillel Slovac   John Frusiante is their best guitarist next is Josh
You’re a great, great, greatly band, one of the best ever, we get it. We love it
thanks so much guys. thanks. so. much.
Mi love iu
I love how they still got it! Thirty years later they still give me goosebumps!
בואו לישראל
Look bro... sexiness aside, you'll never be as good as Ween.
This is like a modernized version of a late 60s hard rock song and that's the highest of compliments.
Brasil adora love
🤔🎤🎤👏🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎤
j'aime beaucoup
They just keep getting better!
It's good
fiffrrr
My new fav song  these guys still have it . I saw them 20 years ago lucky to look into Flea's eyes and he was in a diaper
Love it
Frusciante is the reason this is so good . Throw the rest out , he outshines them so much . Too much player , not enough band .
They always had stupid ass fuckin lyrics  only  under the bridge and Californiacation are the only ones that make any sense
RHCP "La petite Mort" ...for me🔥💫🎶🎵
If there's been anything constant in my life it has been the red hot chilli peppers, i was born in 99, same year californication came out, and my mom always tells me the same story, about how we had a cassette with the californication single and how playing it would act as a lullaby to me
Still coming out with bangers

Chorus sounds like Slow Cheetah. Good job guys.... you ripped off yourselves.
🤠🤘🤠🤘🤠🤘🤠🤘🤠🤘
AK's voice is sooooooooooooooo underrated.
Now, 8 months later, even in my wildest dreams I didn't think the following months would turn out SO GOOD

I’m sooo happy you guys are back!!!! Everyone has been waiting for new music!
I'm so glad I saw them this year especially with john back x
Trash song
My favorite song since Blood Sugar Sex Magic
Still gold
1:34
What's with the weird vocals and accent? This is garbage.
It's amazing that rhcp hasn't change their pattern of music.i always enjoy listening to rhcp
Big fan
Back again....just caught that line of creation takes your supply...so true. I definitely feel this tune is my explanation of feelings I have about our world in 2022..
Please Never stop playing music 🎵
Anthony kesdys no se va de la música y nunca se irá, flea usando un chal de Perú!
I think that I will use this song in one of my literature courses--students can analyze it in a discussion.  I like to incorporate up-to- date poetry for the students to examine and not just poets who have been dead for decades or centuries.  The are many allusions and symbols in this song, and it is related to current events.
more like "waiting on a black winter time to end" RHC are back
Це літо було дійсно чорним...
The  drums it was like a Californication beats
500 by me so far
I love this song so much here's to a billion views
Sounds like a cornish farmer from England lol 😆
joah was the better guitar player
Man I absolutely love this bands music!! I do, but can someone explain to me why Will Ferrell is always on drums??!! 🤔🤣😂
Buena canción
🌱🌾🍀🌻🌹
Amooooooooooo  !!!! 😉🤩🤩🤩🤩😉

What's Flea wearing? - it's beautiful
Jhon 😍
Damn the way tht guitar solo hits😭
O Rock pra mim ainda vive com Red hot chili Peppers, Coldplay, Imagine dragons, Bring me The Horizon, Slipknot, Disturbed e Maneskin.
Honestly, it was mine black summer..   The timing 😮
Блять ,старый дед, 😫 но музыку делает..?. Респект от 🦷🫀
Anthonys voice comes through a bit weird. Too much pitch correction.
They are fantastic!Vocal,guittars,bass,drums.. essencially rock'n roll  in his best's perform.. fans around the world are gratefull With this  new song!
This is perfect! Just perfect!
FLEA... Damn
Как будто высох....Не нравится
Yup I think RHCP are done for man an I hate to say that, jus not what they use to be, an it sucks cause John is back he deserves more imo...
I Love it
Turks are loving you RHCP
TOP HOT
love this band but when John plays his solo it's amazing like if I go into a 3rd world that's just a spark of dust floating away.
You rock my life since I was a child now I have 30 years old and now I continue hearing and singing your music
Great song and great video... Not sure why Justin Long is the singer in the video or why Will Ferrel is playing drums but I dig this
This could perfectly be the ending song to a series
😎👌👌👌

They should stop
So cool SO COOL!!!!!!! 💫
RHCP video’s are so creative!!!!!!
0:47 sounds like coffee shop  , feewak on your hotspot
LARGA VIDA A RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!🤪🤘🏻
Chitarre in perfetta armonia. Frusciante: bella interpretazione. Comparto video: non sono un estimatore del "Chroma key" ma nel complesso apprezzabile.
God Bless!!! Red - Hot - Chili - Peppers  You boys have been my go-to since I was in middle school! I am 36 now....37 in February.  Keep the the beats and the best riffs coming! Chili Peppers for the win! For the world! For LOVE! for LIGHT!
a dude my mom knows from work apparently let them play at his frat party in 88 or 89. he had to kick them out because they kept being too loud and jumping on the furniture. love the chili peppers and i love their new album. just saw them in philly a few weeks ago and i rlly enjoyed it!
Ah~ SENSACIONAL!!!
That was a hellish summer.  Can almost still smell the smoke still.
Han pasado varios meses y aún cada vez que la escucho me gusta más y más
And this, kids, is real music.
wooooowwwwwwwwwww
I like they rock that song black summer
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Para muchos, el 2021 fue un black summer :(
Kiedis: aged  Flea: aged  Smith: aged  Frusciante: undiminished by the passage of time
Good song
No surprise here, just some more outstanding creative  jam!    The formula is based on, well, let's just leave it at "A'lot" 🏁⚜️
vocals are the worst part
all eyes anthony wen he has his shirt off lol
Now I know how adults felt when they where kids hearing a banger song come out.
QUE BANDA F0D4
Got a Jethro Tull thing going on.
Emang the best lah 4 engkong legend ini 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿

Sorry but this song sucks TRY AGAIN GUYS  , i really think you have LOST IT BUT you can find it IF you try Harder
Para Solo Con A.  Los años pasan pero continúan inalterables en su estilo.
love this song
Супер! Группа на века!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This is an awesome psychedellic Doors-like song wasted by bad production. I could imagine it as a song by The Doors, which shows a great of a song it is, but it needs much more atmospheric vocals, guitars and/or keys and much less busy drumming and strumming, stick to a simple beat and get shamanic with some layered instruments and backing vox... the Flea bassline alone will give it that RHCP signature, no need to get cute and showy
Wasn't California-cation the last video for MTV pop up I remember that and then everything went all on the web I wish music wasn't so abused and a cd was what you earned doing lawns in the summer....mp3 go to hell and all you pirates that want free music
This song reminds me of my kid sister going off to be an adult . Shit  time does fly . Next ill be an old fart
I am addicted to RHCP
Everything is good but the moustache of Anthony....lol
Volta anos 90 por favor red hot
It's wild to watch Under The Bridge immediately after and see how much the same four guys have changed in thirty tears!
Still banging, well done🙃👍👍👏👏👏
I have being waiting for eternity for this THE RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS ARE BACK!🤧🥲
Fly уши эльфа надеть нужно. Будет круто. Вы суперкруты, ребята. Спасибо что вы есть. Вырос на вашей музыке.
I'm a hip hop guy myself but I love the peppers everything they make is good

Sweetly sung bad ass music. RHCP!
I love how the guy from The Retro Future is playing Anthony's part in this video and nobody noticed.
Listening to this album was like scratching a lottery ticket you get all the way to the end and no matter how bad you want it it's not a winner
😘😘😘
He looks like a karate instructor from the 80s

You know Anthony is feeling it when the shirt comes off lol
The more Anthony gets older, the better his voice sounds. 🔥
今高校生なのですかレッチリ知ってる人いなくて寂しい😞

This Song is just soooo beautiful!! Never commented twice on one single song before. Rock on forever!! Songwriting, Vox, Guitar, Base, Dru,ms is just fitting so perfectly! Masterpiece! Love you!!!
OMG this song is so fukn addictive. Like 3 times a day I come back here.
One of the VERY VERY FEW actual Super Groups  Still extant and rocking.   Which is important because there’s no replacing them for the grandkids,  So far anyway…

Saw these guys in Boston at Fenway. They don't disappoint. Tons of energy and just a great show

I want to hear John F, Josh K and Jimmy Page jam the fuck out in a tiny, pub somewhere in France. They are the best of the best and all three completely lose themselves in the music.  It would be beyond comprehension
Thank you, It was really helpful.

He must be talking about the summer of 2020 when BLM were burning/destroying businesses across the country. Over 30 people died and billions in damage. But Jan 6th or something like that. 😂
This is the magic of RHCP, they release songs which could have perfectly been released 15 years ago
Wow.. JOHN WICK is RHCP new guitarist
https://youtu.be/2XHO58R6xBQ😎🎵

This song was dropped too late lol...  Should have been in The Big Lebowski (1998)

Red Hot until 95:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOzQbhepeFQ
John is back.
My earworm for 2022!
The triumphant return of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers is a breath of youthful freshness in our souls, which takes us back to the glorious '80s and '90s.  And that brings tears to my eyes.  It's great that the RHCP has returned in full force.
40M LET'S GO!
Rhcp inspires me so much. I just posted my first ever YouTube video after I felt extremely motivated in their concert.
F yah welcome back John fruscante
Red hot Very good music Rock 90 /2000
The song that started it all
Portugall!!!!
Maravilha
For those in the know , YaWhoDa wadded Thanos , Enoch that's who   Ya WhoDa  wadded , Thanos world's largest planet betcha can't find it . Complete annihilation.
I am going to comment again! When I get on an open highway late at night? I bump this tune and just cruise, California style!
💯💯💥💥💯💯
Best song
It's almost like 2005 again.
Every RHCP music album  is a masterpiece, regardless of the year.
before 1 day looking for a app that work, finally i found
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤🔝🔝🔝🔝
Yeah the RHCP.  Thats sound! :)
Linda música
Their getting older for sure, but their art of music is pretty amazing!
It feels so good to hear the froosh with the band again
Parabéns meus amores! Melhor clipe de rock Vmas 2022! 🏆
Can feel slow cheetah vibes 🥰
no importa el tiempo red hot chili perppers sera siempre de los grandes
🙌
🤩😘🌏
Excelent. I from Argentina
In all it's beauty and glory, this is as Red hot chili peppers as it gets. after all these years they're still able to make something so beautiful and yet so fresh. They are immortal.
all my faves are making come backs. oh... what a time to be alive
He looks very good at his 60years old ❤️👍
Didn't know John Wick plays guitar
Anthony s got the Gayest haircut ever
AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Gen X music can’t be touched.
Siguen vivos!!! Fuck yeah lml
Постарел....Но как и всегда - топ. Легенда.....
Great song, Red Hot Chili Peppers.✅✌️
Anthony looks so like his late father Blackie nowadays.
bro why does he sound irish
It's a true Black Summer this Year.
IT'S A TRUE BLACK SUMMER THIS YEAR !
Look... It's a good song and all, but that 70's porn 'stach is very distracting.
Noma
I really hope they keep making music I never want it to end 🥲
Ya era hora que volviera josh frusciante ... se nota la diferencia... Arriba RHCP 👏👏👏
1:52😍
The solo guitar make me crazy!! I love it🔥
They sound irish ☘️ 🍺
Gute brüder
Literally…..for people from Ukraine 🇺🇦
John looks like Keanu reeves in this video lol
RHCP.🙂🙂🙂👍👍
This brings me right back to when the Californacation album dropped in 1999. Nostalgia 🥲
jhon emang the best tapi kok gua seneng kalo si jhos yg maen yaa kelihatan banget energik nyaa
just as good as their 90s songs. so glad my dad grew up knowing them and introduced them to me. my fav band
His voice is legit
RHCP they're back.. bring a grown up sound 😂
Real Music 🎶
Even when I was a kid, they've always sounded remarkable. All these years and they never needed to change how they sound.
I loved 💖the song and what an amazing video 😁
This song cool.
Just doesn't have the Hook I wanted. Not one of their best, may have been a B side on an earlier album, but still better than most anything being shoved down our throats today. Agree with all other comments though so good to see and hear John Frusciante. His guitar feels like a warm blanket and takes you back to better times and music. Love the Peppers I think they've got more and better songs in them.
A sailor spoke too soon, you guy music is bullshit
Esse solo … meu Deus ….
I am one new fan. What an awesome group. Don't know everything about them but I only know one thing they are the greatest. Amazing energy
These guys just don’t age! With all the crap they have all been through they STILL look and sound DAMN good 👍🏿

love this song
omg if nobody would have told me that John was back but just listening to this song ... it is so clear
The Best music in the world!!!!
God damn it. Buy a f***ing shirt already. Oo
Best band since I started listening to them in the early 90's. This is exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you rhcp for being the best.
My favorite Frusciante
one of the finest songs you guys have made, much love and keep rockin!
To
Ok but nothing to shout about with that being said purple stain is still upon my pillow
Fuck the haters this song rocks.
Respect that they are not resting on their laurels.  Not easy to do in this youth-centered culture.  RHCP forever,
Thank you so much!  I seen yous live MSG NYC
I'm feeling this right now
Go go go Will Ferrer!
Anthony still looks so good.
Loving the mtv performance 🔥🔥💟#rhcp
Los coros de Jhon te transmite a tiempos legendarios 🤩
Chorus is too much like Edwins Song Hang Ten
John looks like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) lol
Thanks RHCP

John and her intact magic
Anthony eternally Young,Living and dying Alternative of living eternally for ever.
Melhor cd dele pra mim sugar sex Magic
Harmonia composição timbre instrumental é incomparável
Jhon é surreal outro planeta melhor formação do red hot s dúvidas c é loko
they did it again, and again and again and….now again. 🖤
Dynamite! In my Hollywood 80s the Peppers would play at Cathay de Grande off Hollywood Blvd. A bare bones club they could hose down after closing. In those days, at the break, they would leave and come back wearing just socks on their c___s. People would hurry to get behind the stage's open area to see Anthony's muscular butt. I still laugh at that memory. They have been through SO much and here they are.
Real majic . Maji , magic  . tod .
Anthony is a master of the universe  ,  only a few can write and sing the tune  ,  peace , love  , hope and understanding , tod .
That´s real shit! <3
sounds like a just dance song
Best band ever
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌🏼🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Très bon 👍👍
This song really reminds me of someone
They still killing it.
Somzera!!! John destroy na guitarra🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
:DDDD
Jethro Tull- ish.
whoa......sweet...
hermoso video y cancion
I can always learn from this band and I'm so thankful for it
john john john !!!!  thank's, good
The song is amazing, the video is kinda mid though. All they did was dance in front of a green screen for most of it
Easily the best intro of recent times. Beautiful guitar sound.
This is real music

2:48 HE DID ZYZZ POSE!
Man Debroah Chow directed this, I thought that lighting was Mandalorian-like. Awesome clip
Red Hot Chilli Papa!
😊
This song is a 10! WOW! Don't know how they did it but they did!
Very cool tune. Hendrix inspired guitar and that solo banged.
This dude has been ripped my whole life lol
I full expect John Bernthal with a mustache to play Anthony Keidis in their Biopic someday in the future
Esta cancion cada vez pega mas, el coro es buenisimo y lleva toda la escencia de los red hot
yeah that's good
This song>>>>
I first heard this on the radio and thought this sounds a lot like a BAD Chili Peppers wanna-be band. Sounds like they're a parody of the Chili Peppers.
Que loco como va mejorando con los meses. ❤
#stop #russia #russian #missiles ! STOP #genocide #ukrainian #people ! (Please supporting in media etc.) #closethesky #ukraine #noflyzoneua #savedefenders of #mariupol 💙☀️
awesome work guys
its ours time
always love will ferrel on the drums
Just saw them in concert, cant wait for the next one. Forgot to get a shirt though :(
Al principio no me convenció demasiado, pero para mi ya es una canción legendaria de ellos, el video es una pasada y como suena ese bajo y ese solo dios!!
Keanu reeves?
😍😍😍😍
В 21 столітті ритм задають перці!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ἄξιος !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The best album since By The Way.  Even better them the previous with Frusciante (Stadium Arcadium).
✨✨
Am I the only one who gets Jethro Tull vibes??
My favourite band since I was 14 🖤
We've all been waiting for another great summer to begin, RHCP, we hear you.
Saw them today at the Skydome in Toronto, it was amazing.
Que solo maravilhoso fuck
12 años conoci a esta banda
Even more of a bop in concert
I LOVE IT
for a man who has 60 years Old he is still very handsome
AWESOME!!!!
well this is not Californication.........
No supero este video,  es una genialidad!  🤩 Que bueno ser fan peppero en estos tiempos 💜
Are they trying to copy Zappa?
♥️✌️🌸🙏🏽🎶 damn I wouldn’t have recognized lead singer 🤔 yet time is but a blink  I’m just a ole hippie always the baby !! 65 next month  NO WAY
Temazo, saludos desde Cordoba, Argentina amigo
Sounds like the other song
Red Hot Chili Peppers fuer imma
I hate when they remove some of the drumming parts
Thank you guys for still giving us this amazing Stuff. Even in this strange times, RHCP are always reliable😁
Im addicted to every note of this song
I'm so glad that they're still doin...Its a new chapter for me personally. Love em
Omg Flea you always make me smile. Thank you for all the years of smiles. I wish I could join you in Australia for that mind blowing 1000 time playing Give It Away! Maybe you could send me airfare. PLEASE!!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!
Legendary band with their best album yet...Frusciante dominates this one
3:33 Chad goes for the crash cymbals, no sound. Even the best of edited videos there are a few mishaps; I both edit and play percussion.   This is one of the best songs in their arsenals though, rock on!
Sea shanty? Wtf
VOTE FOR BLACK SUMMER!!! BEST ROCK FOR VMA!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥like if you love Tippa My Tongue
This was one of my moms favorite bands she passed away in 96 so RHCP means a lot to me. Love that they’re still making music
los red hot siendo los red hot....INCREIBLE
So rhcp, feeling so real right now
This just came out, and there’s a NEW album coming out in October! Warner brothers has these guys cranking out the albums don’t they. Must be one hell of a contract these guys have. They’re doing something right. They’re hard working musicians for sure.
who turned on the damn heater, it's summer???? (god damn sexy mohican ;) -A
I love you !!!!!
Every rhcp has their own sound so much that even Chad had a special chili peppers sound on the skins that is very distinct
tão bao
Amazing song ❤️
John goat
Red hot chili 🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️Peppers  still around and still sound great 🎙️🎃🎸
🤟🤟🤟
😃КОГДА В НОВОСИБИРСК ПРИЕДТЕ0??????????????????🏃‍♀🏃‍♂🏃‍♂🏃👩‍🦽👩‍🦯🚴‍♀🛵✈🚞☣🔨⚒,🔧
The Peppers are always, always there for you, bringing flavor and nourishment
I wish I look as them in my 60s ;)))
RHCP need to come to Idaho or the northwest
Why the drummer looks like will ferrel
Seria épico uma música com a Shakira e no clipe Antony e Shaki dançado juntos
Nice song
Pedophile still making music
Chad looks like Will Ferrell, John looks like Keanu Reeves, who do Anthony and Flea look like?
I swear...Flea's the motherfuckin shit
Saw this live in Seattle. FUCKING EPIC.
The truth needs smooth lyrichs.! Thank you babes!! 🙏🏽❤️
I listen to this all the time never stops
THANKS, we've got something after all.
This song was awesome live in Nashville
I just wish he'd shave the moustache off looks weird
Sigan haciendo música siento que revivo los amo desde Argentina
Frusciante is back :,)
One of the best songs they have made
Meh
I love how that first solo comes in almost John's going Yeah! I'm back motherfuckers!
Am I the only one who thinks Black Summer is up there with Dani California, Snow, By The Way, Californication, Otherside and Give It Away?
Jhon Wick en la guitarra 🎸
Siguen rockeando como siempre. La banda nunca envejece. Me encanta esta canción.
後面越聽越好聽
Hello 08/15/2022
So heartwarming to see John again. And this song is great!!
Flea sporting a D. Boon sticker on his bass.  RIP

cogemeeeee johnnn
What a Nice Black summer for mankind. This may be our last, but at least with good misic. Farewell Earth people ...
Comerciales los odio…
WOW
This song is horrible.
man....I love this song....listened to it a hundred times....and it keeps digging itself deeper into my cells, more and more love
:)
This highly commercial, lightweight pop-rock sounds absolutely nothing at all like the RHCP of the first three, probably four albums. Nothing wrong with it per se, and nothing wrong with a band changing and evolving, but this is a million miles away from their "psychedelic sex funk" of the 80s. Some might prefer it, but I.prefer the energy, inventiveness and bravado of their earlier work to this by-the-numbers chart-fodder.
I love ❤️
Go leafs
It sounds like he says "waitin' on another black son of a bitch"

The answer, the music they eat smell and drink easy to understand, but always people fail to get the message they give. Like dinosaur roamed before and time pass by to shows up. Rebirth after destruction. Hhhh
Тони Кидис супер, Фли постарел

Одна из лучших песен RHCP. Спасибо за эмоции.
100% pure RHCP ❤‍🔥
This song kept me from crashing into reindeer today.. The reindeer becomed my friend!
Awesome damn song and video! I wish they would re-shoot “It’s Only Natural” video posted here. That too, it a great song but the current video sucks.

This song rocks reminds me of a late afternoon cruise
Yeah...nah. Where's the funk?
Где та самая наркомания?
Good son
Good song
is it just me or is there like a small Gaelic twang to his voice?
Best concert I've ever seen!!!
Keep the music going guys. Keep speaking from the soul cause it's speaking to mine. Awesome band = awesome music.
LINDA A MUSICA
Not there best work, I kind of like where Josh was taking them.
I would think I'm my wildest dreams I would listen to another BANGER FROM THIS BAND....
Just saw them perform this live in Las Vegas- perfection 🙌🏼
Listen to this or you whon't have taste in music.
İ enjoy every time when i listen to it.
WOW!! That was freaking GREAT!! I will always love RHCP's music. Been following their music, buying their albums since the late 80s. To me one of the GREATEST BANDS OF ALL TIME!
It hurts so much to see a band I loved so much make such shit songs.
I heard this song on the radio the other day and was surprised when the DJ said it's new. I could have swore this was one of their old classics.
Thank you
As good as anything they're ever done
That guy will be 60 in two months.
VOTE FOR *BLACK SUMMER* FOR *BEST ROCK* FOR VMA!
thanx for this
Love this song, but don't like his chucklevision vibe.
Sehr geiles Video. Echt heftig wie Gut sie sich gehalten haben.
John plays Jimi
Man!! This song deserves more appreciation..RHCP is the best band ever
Black Summer = foreshadowing to grid instabilities in NA
Question is... what do they mean by black summer?    (Blackouts?)
Wonder about that symbolic Archer, if the bow is his Qesheth missing the middle path. IDK, food for thought for the few.
im not even a fan of red hot chili peppers but this was a banger! keep it up guys!
Malcolm Mcdowell, keanu Reeves, Will Farrell and Justin Long did it again.
My childhood band.
ШЕДВР Я ИЗ РОССИИ
ШЕДЕВР. Я ИЗ РОССИИ
The song is eerily similar to Nana Mouskouri's 'L'amour C'est Comme L'éte' - 1974  As a huge RHCP fan, this conflicts me.  https://youtu.be/lFqtTLgPzy0
Love it ! John fuciniwhatever is amazing.
I love these guys, second reunion with spectacular effect!!!
My generation's Zeppelin.
Thank god john has returned
I tell ya boys and girls, this summar been effed as hell. This song speraks truth - let it roll by and onto the next.
Please vote this song for Best Rock at the MTV VMA Awards 2022
I love the chili peppers so much. Grew up on Ozzy and Black Sabbath then Metallica all albums. But I fell in with the chili peppers completely, playing all their shit on guitar. I love John F way better than Josh K. His role in the band speaks for itself. I know Black Summer is good. But in my opinion The Getaway was so much better than the new album with guitar God John F. Again that's my opinion but maybe I haven't give the album enough attention.
Love the song love Anthony but looking like the tiger king. J's🤣
Everything they do is a masterpiece
the VIBE is out of this world. 1000% Red Hot Chili Peppers
Was at their L.A. show and they are by far the best band I have ever seen perform live.
Please never stop making music! I love you guys!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I b bbvvvvbbvvvbfimimimim the lizard queen I’m the lizard queen
Anthony still has that perfect voice. This band is evergreen.
Will Pharrell and Reeves killed it
why there is Keanu Reeves playing the guitar?
Lyrics: A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
7M FINALLY!
*VOTE FOR RHCP FOR "BEST ROCK" FOR VMA!*
As a lifetime fan. I just gotta say. Those last two albums blew dongs! This is the chili peppers I remember thank you guys for coming back
I need Flea as it was in 05-Good Angels since 3:33. Give me my RHCP. Flea alone is rubbish. Give this collaboration with John. Give me you, guys.
I need more collaboration Flea with John at the end of any song. You can do it, guys. It's required.
And a black as hell summer did we get ...
Anthony’s voice is so soft and gentle, also roars with passion, it’s so unique, even better after all these years!!
Exelente
Every time they release a new single it doesn’t hit at first for me, but dang do they always grow on me
I like your song go hard I am biggest fan of red hot cillil pepper that song go hard for real straight up no lie 💯
When i herd this on the radio i had no idea if its rhcp and surly it is !! Just like good ol times
Not sure exactly what the lyric is about? Is it just poor little me? Or something bigger, like climate destruction? The video is interesting but yeeks, it’s just them posturing, looks like. More the point, the feel of the tune is so magically musical & energizing. Wonderful that they continue to create at this level!
That’s summer is really black
Red Hot as it is...The Band that nourished 90's teen...
Pay attention to the lyrics. They are dark and unfortunately true 😔 We must protect our planet from ourselves, war is waiting on our doorstep. Peace and Love more than ever ❤☮
Anthony is looking remarkably good for being 60 years old, especially after all the drugs he took for years. So glad he got clean and stayed clean. And on another note, glad John is back in the band. Flea killed it as always. And Will Ferrell did a good job on drums. 😉😆😆😆
The most complete Band!!!!
Please vote Black Summer for Best Rock Song MTV Music Awards VMAS
Santa Claira concert was boring. New guitarist ok,but didn’t/won’t play their best tunes. Seemed unorganized and more of a practice session.
Awesome!
Still jamming after all these years, love it!!!!
Эй, Мы ещё живы!
Jimi Hendrix lives on through this band! Wow! This song is an anti depressant! A new hope lives in this song
John frusiante=keanu reeves
Always looking pretty, ANTHONY is unbreakable a eyecatcher and his voice is unchanged. This crazy band is always on toppppp. Thank you for your wonderful music,boys!🤗💓🌶️👌🔥✌️
Summer of 2024-25
I never liked the first songs until after a live show and a full album;  they just become a new part of life and the experience. From BSSM to stadium, I’m with you to the getaway, they grow on me fast!
vote en mtv  ´por el .mejor black summer
epicoo
after so many years.. they keep it red and hot!!
Que bueno q haya vuelto John Frusciante, sin él, este grupo no era nada
go futher like it 😊
This is absolute Magick unwinding!
😇😇🙃🙃🙂🙂❤️♥️🧡💖👍🌹
Damn, that solo is sooooooo good!
Vote for RHCP "Best Rock" for the VMA
Haven't been a long time listener but this band absolutely kills it every time and its so crazy they're going on for what like 35 years now
Damn, Funky Hitler
Amazing! I just saw them live, and I couldn’t believe my eyes.
go Billy!
💓💓💓
Kya haal hai?
My choice for the anthem of 2022
And look at Deathlok #2 yall! Maybe we can get a Forge and Machine Man adventure yall! That seems feasible for print! And Mojo and Longshot!
You have to look at the Annual: Machine Man & Bastian feat Cable yall!
Yall check out X Force 35 also! They got Nimrod! Another villain Machine Man appeared with along with High Evolutionary yall!
Yall. Maybe we can get Taylor in the new Pirates Movie!
Yall! Let's get to 36 to match Captain Jack!
Yall! I cannot post on Instagram because I have no room! Yall! Maybe Taylor has been on an Erin Brockovich type tear yall! Think about havin all your personal songs held hostage like that? What would you do to free youself? Go to a 100 different places and get the best recording studios and artists help ya out! That's prolly what's really goin on!
Listened to rhcp a lot when I was pregnant and now it’s the only music my baby will fall asleep to 😊🤘
تحية ل فلتة زمانو
My Grandmother absolutely loves the Chili Peppers. Enough said!!! They will entertain generations to come... JMA
Hello from Russia
Masterpiece
John being back and with a track like this this is almost too much to bear sometimes.
Ses. Dout . Jador. Les. Chenson. Dout
Tippa My Tongue 👅
Fuccccckkkinnnn FLEA!!!! Let's go McFly!
Got the cd. Love the whole thing.....except this song. The fake accent thing is so annoying. Plus, the radio burned me out early with too much airplay. Poster Child is Anthony's best vocals on the cd. Takes him back to classic Anthony and the Peppers.
Their best song since Snow (Hey Oh). And they’ve had plenty of great stuff in between!
It's good to see the comment section is still to stupid to see the message behind the music!!still a great band thow. Keep up the kicking ass!!
Сreate forever...)
Amo esta canción, por la cresta, vengan a chile 💚💚💚💚💚
Can't wait... Oct. 14 is my BDay, so it will be a wonderful day when this drops. I can feel it already! Rock on Chili Peppers! 🤘
That drums sound. classic
josh did his best but john just hits different
This isn't the chili peppers I know 😑
Como sempre, impressionando!🔥🔥
This is RHCP!
Saw them in Denver, it was their first concert on the North American leg of their tour.  These guys don't see to age!  Their sound live is something to heard, it's nothing like what you here on album.  So glad to see John back!!
The coolest old dudes ever
Wow
awesome track 👍
✊
This screams NWO
legend
Badass brother
GO & VOTE FOR THE CHILI PEPPERS FOR THE VMA! BEST ROCK
Still got it, fleas poppin bassline and JF's slick ass riffs. Refreshin 🤙
Love how they sound the same. I wish there was more music like this instead of the trash music they have today
Im Really hoping for a side B album as strong as Im with you side B, this album have awesome songs but most of em are super weak
Love this album
Love
John frusciante my friends, he's the man of the band.  Welcome back john .
It's good though I don't know who mixed this but freshetta should be louder text to talk never spells it right
Two year ago, band from Elblag (Poland) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dBn7QQ-b-Y Greetings! :)
Frusciantes face is a sight for sore eyes and his guitar a sound for sore ears. God damn how good is it to have him back with the boys?!?!
классные ребята..классная песня👍👍👍
🔥🙏🔥
stupido anthony kiedis su cara de niño y se volvio hace poco un señor que chistoso un bebe con bigote que bonito se ve
Still got it all these yrs l8ta 🎶🤘
terrible song trying to recreate the magic of under the bridge r.i.p. chilli peppers, not so hot anymore you had your day in the sun now it's time for the retirement village where you belong you're past your use by date just a bunch of wrinkled old nut sacks
WAITIN ONA NOTHER BLAACK SUUUMER TOO EEENNNNND
30 years later Hector Bellerin going to be look like him
Love it!!
Always enjoy Will Ferrell on drums.
Does Anthony Kiedis ever keep his shirt on? Lol
I love you guys! Your music is medicine for my soul! <3 Thanks for being here!
His awful pop singing since Californication is boring and shameful. He graved one of the most unique bands in rock music history. They had to get rid of Antony long time ago. RHCP was my favourite band in 90's and I grew up with their personality and Great music, however the fame spoiled Antony or he is probably the one, who never got the talent and determination, intelligence of the rest of the members of the band to be able to evolve in the right way.
This song is great. It is a hit. But where are the other hits from this album??? :(
Its great to see Will Ferrell on drums but surprising to see Mario on vocals!
I’m actually disappointed in this, I liked the last 2 albums with Josh.
🔥
Maybe it’s just me and it most likely is but in the first few minutes I detect a little bit of Ian Anderson’s Locomotive Breath in Anthony’s voice.  But regardless what I think it’s the best of the most beautiful music. Always has been always will be.
And now it's turn for... .Return of the Dream Canteen!
vc na foto?
Amen
Back to the basics I love this song it's like rhcp are making again their unique sound they used to late 80's early 90's
Niceee
They never get old!!!!
My dad saw them in a garage in the 80s now he jams them in heaven.
Great band!
AMAZING! 🌶🌶🌶

Que nostalgia cara...a essência é a mesma 🤩🤘
This is a song made by a band that know exactly who they are. Well Done!
This is truly amazing and inspirational
Brooo this feels so sureal my brother who is 17 years older listens to music like this and now i am too around the same age he did too thank you peppers for this
Hey john, dont ever disrespect me lookin like Keanu Reeves picked up guitar and became a guitar god, ya hear
John, RHCP has been my favorite band since 2000. 22 years. The first time I had a chance to hear you guys out in Turkey, you weren't there, you had left. Please sort out your whatevers and never go away again? I'm 38 now. I can't think of a RHCP without you.
This music video is SO DOPE! 💯
Love !!!!
that solo is the bomb
this would deserve a live performance like Don't forget.....
When I heard this I got a 90s RHCP vibe. That goes to say this song is as good as their 90s stuff and they still got it.
Micheal Peter one of the greatest basist all time..
5 decades of brilliance. Who else?

One of the last few bands still having their Mojo intact
Didnt know Will Farrel was their drummer
After all these years they put out this motherfucking gem!!! RHCP for life!!
They are killing it!! Hell yea!!
Music is their passion , flowing in their bloods, just focused and determine to deliver
Love love love it
Hector bellerin.. Is that you?
Haunting ……perfect
They simply dont make bands like the Red Hot Chili Pepper anymore!!!
The next 30 Year´s !!!

After all these years you still got it. Love you guys
❤️❤️❤️
Black Summer is coming in 2023. That's when the globalists will make life miserable.

The stach gotta go though
iT'S very good... good times of RHCP
So nothing new
am i back in high  school this is amazing
Sounds like an Irish Sea shanty
This band just delivered a new album! Wow
Skies opened.  I love you
Anthony copies exactly how I get ready to take a shower
Yo ya me dibuje al bob patiñio abusado sexualmente de bart Simpson
Heard this on the radio, and thought cern took me back to the 90s.
Anthony loose the mustache look like your dad! lol
JOHN FRUCIANTÉ AND FLEA!!!
I heard this song the other day... My Beautiful Angel Received Her Wings, And Awaits Me. She Loved Summertime and The Chili Peppers !!! Thank You For This Song Guys... RIP Baby... I'll Mourn You Till I Join You.
Solamente maravilloso los 4 deberían quedarse así como parados en el tiempo que se vengan màs años para ellos aunque sea inevitable
OMG!! RHCP are back!  🎸🎸🎸🎸👌
Climate change is something real
He needs to lose the moustache and grow his hair long again he looks like hitler now
FRUNSANTEEE !!! plz dont never never go ! if you go ! plz comeback
Love all of you through the years. And I mean years. I started listening to you when I was 12 back in 1994. Can’t get you off of my mind and I like it.
Love you guys 😔👍
Why does he sound like he's pretending to be Irish or something. Weird ass accent or whatever. I literally didn't even know this was the red hot Chilli peppers. Was like pirates pretending to sound like them.... wtf is this. Lol
Super
Anthony throws off the mic stand at 02:59. But thereafter, it's seen all over the place, sometimes standing upright, sometimes on the floor.! Probably intentional...😁
It's amazing that every time John is in the band they strike gold. Such a great guitarist and apparently has a huge impact on song writing too. Good times!
Good to see John back, I always loved how he compliments the band with his playstyle.
don't belive they launched this song in 2022
Love ❤ this song. Made me feel nostalgic for Californication and by the way. My all time favorite albums from any band.

Nunca se me va a olvidar la primera vez que vi el vídeo.   00:46 se me salieron las lágrimas por la emoción y alegría por verlo de nuevo.
Califorinacation 2.0
Anthony’s still got it after what? 30 years?

essa musica é top demais
정말 멋지다! 존경스럽다.
China is on the darkside of the moon....this will age well
eto pezda
I can't believe they are 60. Still the best band ever! I remember when I was young, I always watched them in the MTV... I grow up with this fantastic band!! And Anthony still hot! ❤️
Good to see Anthony sporting a mullet, at least that's what it seems!
Nothing is worse than ageing rock stars too blind to see that its over.  Everything after Californication (or maybe By The Way) is proof of that
This is great song why it's so underrated  ?
so brilliant !!
How about that solo though wow John is amazing. First time I heard it I had to learn it
Seen them in Paris last week after a 7h drive and 16 years of memories listening to their songs, shit what a feel... ❤️
keep it real... forever
Anthony going for the Landon Ricketts part in the Red Dead live action series?
1:50 - 2:32💕
John Wick is great as always
Surprising come back after long time, Good to see you guys again,  John Frusciante shocking makeover giving look as same as Keanu Reeves of John Wick and Cyberpunk 2077, true and big Fan compliment to John, Always Keep rocking bro..💥💥💥🎸🎤🎙️🎚️🥁💥💥💥
Sailing on a censorship clever
Autotune ruins his voice
it's really shocking how good this is
Over $500 to be up front at one of your shows? Bruce Springsteen up front tickets are only $250... and he plays for 3 hours.. and he's got like a 10 piece band to pay. There's only 4 of you. What a fucking rip.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔝✅💯❇↖️
Cadê os Brasileiros?? Essa música é boa ou perfeito 😍
Can't wait to see them at ACL
Love you guys
Back in 1993.... Those are eternal
The music is so killer but my sipping is the problem
Ok, so near the end I was getting this really positive vibe off of this. And IDK but I feel like he was really building to a crescendo as he repeated WAITING over and over again, and it kinda peaked well, but also not at all at what it's full peak feels like it should be. Like he added feeling, but a little more would've gone a long way here and really given this peak a truly memorable edge and yet as it went it just seems like, while again it was ok, it could've easily been so much better.   Like when Phil Collin's did In The Air Tonight, the kind of peak he built up too AND fully achieved. Somehow Black Summer feels like it was building to a similar peak but just kinda came up a bit short of expectations and so meh is the result, uh, the result of the potential peak. The song as a whole is solid enough still. Just missed opportunity to be oh so much better with minimal effort.   Ok, to anyone really analyzing my comment I am comparing this against an existing & massively popular song to form my opinion, but a lot of the ways both songs built up their stories and led into the chorus and peak is similar, and also this is new. So yeah, I'm definitely going to compare it with existing & similar song styles and see how it fares in comparison.   That said, I guess not comparing it with anything else it's actually a very good (not amazing, but like 4 out of 5 stars still) song strictly all on it's own. However myself personally having such a wide breadth & diversified taste & repertoire in music throughout rock history I'm inevitably going to find something to compare it to. And when it does strike a note of something somewhat similar it falls short of my already existing expectations. It's also a different style for the RHCP too. Seriously, RHCP compared to Phil Collin's? Yeah, other than those 2 songs their way different (if only easy rock vs alternative rock). So I don't know what to make of that aspect of it. It's just how I see it.
John3:16 ❤
Fire as always after all them years still rocking like bosses
🔥🔥🔥💗Очень классная песня!! Перцы жгут как в старые добрые)))
About to see them in San Diego this month and I’m so hyped!
When did Will Ferrell join the band?

Sorry guys but with Frusciante they are on another level
A cada dia que passa, essa música fica melhor. Como nos bons e velhos tempos.
🔥👊🏽
Broo 🎸❤️
2022/07/09, place 07, rang 08, bloc D1 in Stade de France, following you as Drummer since 1987... May i play with you on "Aeroplane" or "Me and my friends" on the scene, please Chad, Antony, John and FLEA, PLEASE, PLEASE, I AM FOUND ON YOUR PLAYING WAY! PLEASE! Or play "Fire"! Please!
Flea and John have different view of music and sound. I mean, based on sound. Absolutely, it's different. But what a sound when they are playing together! No one can exists behind this colloboration. It's a pleasure to hear the tune of them. Stupid Flea, sorry. You don't understand the influence on every new song. I would like hear more colloboration with John, because you don't suit each other. Absolutely. But your colloboration borns new vision of sound. I think you are not aware of you're doing. Please, keep it up and never mind. You're really don't understand the listeners. The RHCP creates tune for ages. What the start of the song!
best song they have done after 40 years
Love you all RHCP....John Fruciante...♥️
Love y all❤️
Diooooossssssss🙌🙌🙌
Still got it
so overrated
Hi! Im selling 4 Collector Tickets for Paris Saturday 9 Pelouse Or Debout (standing gold lawn) at Stade de France! Reduced Price!

Person: the guitar does not sing Guitar: 1:52
RHCP ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song is perfect for my morning bong loads and meditation on the balcony
Waw a song! RHCP are back! :D
With that Irish accent, Anthony could have been backed up by Red Hot Chili Pipers.
amo essa música 😍❤🇧🇷
This is fire on mute 🔥🔥🔥
PLAY FRUCIANTE
In order not to miss the news.  I subscribe to you guys.  My bad Im forget it. May God bless us.
oo been 5 months
Nice to see Joe Excotic finally success in his singing career
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Flea just gets older and weirder  He wears skirts now  That’s funny that a guy almost 60 would do that  ;)
I graduated to White Sand in 2010... I'm old but they are still an amazing band!
How does Anthony still look so damn good
Yo no sé ustedes pero me mata ese solo de john regresamos al funky no se mueran nunca!
Only dislike Anthony's moustache ☺
Give me RHCP and i will forget that the time actually passes
grande musica
I'm a huge fan RHCP and a fan of The Good Place and one of the questions in the first episode that Ted Danson asked was "Have you ever seen Red Hot Chili Peppers in concert".  I did when I was 15 when they were touring with Dave Navarro in the mid 90's.  I guess Ted Danson will torture my soul for eternity.
This ROCKKSSSS!! 👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌟🌈
RHCP, back again. For me they are the greatest for now as they've been around and relevant.  And the guitar , wooof , john,  we missed missed  you.

Aaaaah sdd de alguém!
🤯
what's with the wannabe Irish accent? I love this song but that keeps getting to me😂
RHCP will always have that indescribable essence. If you could bottle the best Summer of your youth, toss in some anarchy and a whole lot of wisdom, you'd have every RHCP song ever ❤
Am I only one who doesn't like this song? I love most of their music through the years but this one just sounds like an AI generator listened to all their records and generated this.
In manchester on 22nd June the crowd went crazy for this . They did foe most songs. 2nd best day of my life. Seeing John frusciante live oh  o.m.g.  he's special x

Hoping to see them in concert next year.
typical red hot chili peppers sound, i love it🙂
Sailing on a censored ship, best line ever.
Hehe how did you get such a great pic and sound? What gear you use please? Serious position must have paid some big cash for that slot?? Brilliant recording
I love red hot chili peppers' music!! Great job
Malísimo
The true soul of red hot chili peppers brand new!
Kiedis does NOT look well. Oh also, this isn't very good.
Crazy how summer was the best time when I was a kid. But as an adult, it's just another season to go by
Love seeing John back where he belongs.
Jesus Christ! It´s like time hasn´t gone thru dude, the same fucking amazing essence stills banging!!
This song keeps on growing on me more and more each time I listen to it!!
I'm with NASA
Un mostro de la bartería Will Farrel
I must be one of the happiest persons in the world with theses 4 playing together again!  Love them very much. And I'd like to say that, among all beautiful things about this song, ANTHONY'S VOCALS ARE SOMETHING ELSE!! 🤙🏼🌶️❤️🇧🇷
RTL2
Still you guys are fuckin good ❤️

O que dizer dessa música? Nadaaaa Só sentir!! Que vibe!!!💆🏻‍♂️
Love this song great job
Loving his gay Adolf look🥰
How come no one told me chilli peppers still making hits
Anthony’s strong presence and voice. Flea’s immeasurable energy and groove. John’s soulful and wizardly playing. Chad’s impeccable timing and rhythm. Outstanding song writing from all of them. RHCP is the most complete band ever!!!
I got the feels when I saw Jon Frusciante. The band is just not the same without him.
I love that solo. Great control of sound by John !
Not good
tan viejos csm...y yo con 29 xD
that dude dances like the crackhead in front of every 7-11 at 2 am.
I love this. Wonderful band!!!!!
That song is just spicy 🌶️
This is a fucking tune
Holy shit it’s John!
Trop le moral que les Red Hot soient revenu à leurs origines, ça fait un bien fou et rappelle tellement de souvenirs ! 😁
💖💖💖💖💖💖🌟🌟🌟🌟
Какая же отстойная группа
Por dinheiro. Entendo.
É desgosto mesmo. É como sente.
Seriously sucks ! No wonder the USA went country… Led Zeppelin is not coming back
My goodness, this is timelessly brilliant! Fresh yet so classic!! Not going to lie, it was emotional listening to this track for the first time. Thank you guys, you smashed it right out the park and it's great to have you back when the world needs you most!!!!!

😍
Love these guys
Red Hot Chili Peppers-forever and ever!!!!
I wish my brother was still alive to hear this new album he would love it thanks you Red Hot Chili Peppers for everything you guys do god bless everyone reading this god loves you I miss you bro aka VIDER ❤️🔥
I feel like Dejavu
I swore I heard this when I was a kid… searched it and it came out this year!
This is sucks so bad. Heard this on the radio & reminds me of Kevin’s band from F is for Family
I'm glad Will Ferrell still plays the drums. 🥲
does rhcp really have a genre?
Very underrated
i'm crying right now
🥶
Gran tema!. Ya es todo un clåsico!
Thanks for this emotion ! It's amazing to hear them again - so changed but still the same !
👍
Red hot
Hello
Still kind of mad that they got rid of Josh. He is just as talented as John and brought a good energy to the band.  On a separate note I just watched the Obi-Wan Kenobi series and it is always nice to see Flea flexing his muscles on a different stage.
Legends
Oh man, this sucks!
this tune tingles all nerons. k Reeves the bass vocals you know the tune. you feel it too.
I'm to be 58 this band is not only my timeline but former California culture  I identify  bass vocals all the above ahava adore
this band is the shit captured me at la
This is one talented band..songs come one and u just feel them..and makes u wanna dance...love these guys..#respectlove
Black summer is when Bill Gates sprays dust in the atmosphere...and we all die truth...plants and animals die...

Qué temazo por favor 🙌🏼🖤🖤
This song is pure genuine goodness! I feel like I can taste this song.
Grande diego verdaguer que en paz descanse
Red Hot are eternally Hot 🔥
Epic Song! The more I hear it, the more I Love it! Tremonti & the Chili Peppers! My two favorites!!
Loving the lyrics with it's currency and relevance mixed with the unmistakable sound that is RHCP.  Thank you.
rhcp will never die. Such a powerful group hits straight into space. This energy is something truly amazing. For me, this band like Real Madrid in football, created to be the best. It's a pity that I didn't get to the concert in Moscow in 2015. Come to Russia again. People are waiting for you here.
I'm French, 39 years old and I realize now how it's easy for me to recognize a new RHCP's song. I was so rocked by these melodies. The music, the voice, it's impossible to confuse with another band. Red hot chili peppers are fantastics. The France love you!
Frusciante's the man! The do their best work when he's around
This band feeds my brain
te amo john
00:49 kinda sounds like a Hendrix riff:) love it
I'm sorry Josh, you are a great guitarist, but Frusciante is on a completely different planet. So good to hear him again
Top
No matter what this band does it's just epic. They always seem a way to reinvent themselves. Epic
Flea and Fru blend so well together that some notes are hard to distinguish if its bass or guitar
Anthony charmed me once again with his voice ❤
Song of summer of 22🤘🏻
https://youtu.be/F3VYORQhhWY

AWESOME  LOVE FROM INDIA YOU DUDES ROCK
Frusciante, wow 🤩
Eterni un mito.

Mr. Red Hot Chili Bungle
What a incredible masterpiece from RHCP
I really respect Josh, Dave Navarro (I really liked One Hot Minute) or Hilel Slovak. But, truth is, John was, is and will always be the real guitarist of RHCP. It's just the chemistry and the talent. John will always be the guitarist we want at the band...
Man i haven't heard such a great solo in so longgg
Every Song from the Red Hot chili peppers is incredible.Touches my soul.thank you
John's the best.
Why does Anthony look like Chuck Norris meets magnum PI
Me encanta!!!!!!desde Argentina.
Man this song is like it has always been here it gives you that feeling of late 90’s , early 2000’s vibe, it’s like I’ve listened to this on the summer of ‘02 even though I was 6 years old lol. Long live the chili peppers
By now most other bands would be washed up, but these guys just keep releasing bangers!
The Chili Peppers are Always Amazing! ❤🌶❤🌶❤ Great song! Anthony is sounding 🔥
These guys just don't miss. EVERY song is an instant classic.
Isn’t that about right? We’ve had two shitty summers already. What’s around the corner now?
1983 to 2022 RHCP still the best,
loved it
it's just like watching them in the 90's....these blokes are just perfect
Great, they kept their soul
La j
This is it!!! The sound I've been waiting for!!!! They're back!!!!!!
how good is this song?
"Get it up"
Apocalyptical
aguante frusciante
First saw this today, made me feel 30 years younger seeing Flea's smile!  I love this band like family!
What the hell is with the stupid accent he does at the start
Great music man
why irish u funny old man laugh out loud😜😜😜
Underwhelming.
RHCP is back with a classic cool Funk album ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥☀️  What an amazing comeback
Topp
Caught them on tour in Manchester this week. They just get better and better.  Love this song and so glad they played it in their encore .
4 meses y aún se escucha religiosamente..
I love them but why does he keep that ugly creepy moustache?
WAO!!JohnFurushiantebacksuperRed HatChiripeppa-zu
This guitarist is the best
John wick back on guitar 🤘🏻
Wow, is he singing in an Irish accent?! I can't believe their music just gets better and better. I actually like their later stuff better than the earlier stuff.  Anthony is magical.
Wow! after all of this time these guys are back again with some solid and spiritual music that just kicks ass! I absolutely love this band and they remind me that life is still good when everything else is currently bad!
once you hear Anthony lisp in "...the Skies..." you'll never unhear it
I heard this song when I was at somewhere I truly felt home, now everytime I listen to it I remember that that time and place will never come back
Love this song! I work at a thrift store underneath a radio station called 92.9 KJEE in Santa Barbara, CA.  They always play this song when I'm working, I really do enjoy it.
Fun Fact: This is the same director as Obi Wan Kenobi
What is this song about? I still don't know.
this song has so much meaning in these times, the melody is super addicting too.
This is the worst album they've ever made...
I think they could have done a better job with this video, it looks cheap and uninspired. As for the song itself, what the hell is he talking about (A sailor spoke too soon? China's on the the dark side of the moon? Major Tom? What???) and why does his voice sound like that?
Cruisin' through the flat Montana landscape listening and cruisin' along at 100mph with no cars in sight1
Been a fan since i saw them in house party 83, 84ish.
Will Smith lost a little weight but hasn't effected his drumming one bit.
wow,......legend perform
Wait…… are you telling me that this song wasn’t created back in the 90s? This is amazing!!!! I didn’t know that they were still making music. I got into them a few years ago feeling ashamed that I never gave them a chance back in the 90s and early 2000s. Forgive me everyone
Shoutout keanu reeves on guitar
What is the guy who kidnapped Princess Leia doing playing bass in this band???
❤
Simply thank you RHP. Love from Sri Lanka. Thank you for being true to your soul
will farrell at the drums is killing it :)))
Chrispfish
Te amo rhcp, me sacas de la depresión
Does this have any relation with the zombie apocalypse series _Black Summer?_
This song sounds like it could have been n stadium arcadium
Captions please!!
The Funk is back
When the aliens finally arrive, we'll play them this song and make friends.
when I was 10 years old I listened to blod sugar ........ along the way, any further albums were very good, but after such time the years pass this new album as if time has stopped great muse we are still young and energetic boys are in shape thank you for a great album
Dosed is still haunting
Getting a strong Celtic Irish rock vibe in the beginning then falls into the classic Frusciante influences of 90s peppers .
If they ever make a movie about Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jon Bernthal would play Anthony Keidis, Will Farrell would play Chad Smith, Keanu Reeves would play John Frusciante and Chuck Liddell would play Flea
Best American Band of the last 40 years right here.
Love it !!!
✌
Заебись хули)
GREAT!!
It’s good to see they allowed Will Ferrel to continue drumming. Really enjoy seeing him back there.
Saiko💯⭕👍️♥️♥️♥️
Waking up with the intro of this song in my head for 3 days straight.
this is america.  this is who we are now. we still dictate what the future holds.
Love this powerful song🌋💥
Woohoo seeing them live Aug 21
Great
Nice
💚💚💚💚💚💚🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝↗️🤖👽🌵❇amazing guys
RHCP can do no wrong with their music
00:22 Jon Bernthal.
0:49 why does John look like Keanu Reeves lol
anthony kiedis is best 😭
Me thinks the economy will crash this summer
John 3:16 - For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life.
in John we trust
I am trying to disappear, I want what is best for her. She's too good for me, I do love her ( how can you not) I have hurt too many people and too many are angry, I'm sorry that I never saw this a long time ago. Nobody told me. You are good people. I'm not a monster I got lots of love in me.
Acho que faltou desafinação do Anthony, tipo uma explosão maior, tipo isso sei lá.
Ferrari Band with a Moped singer…🙄😂
😍
The best song🇧🇷❤️
Love this fucking song!!!!!
RHCP TOP! 🤙🏽🇧🇷😎 / 19/06/22.
Woooow. Frusciante. That was final piece of puzzle missing.
sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey, Will Ferrell is on drums!
Welcome Back, Chilies!, see u 12.07. in cosy Hamburg!
Todos los dias escucho esta cancion , TE AMO JOHN😍😘
John Frusciante ; Your guitar playing is simple but classy
Last night 6/18/2022  Zdravko Čolić held a three-hour concert, the man is 71 years old.  You give an hour and a half concert in Budapest and you sing for millions.  Shame on you.
Aqualung my friend, don't you start away uneasy
arthur shelby
John is back and so are the Chili Peppers :)
Definitivamente ese John Frusciante es completamente frusciante.  Hace hablar a esa guitarra con su alma.
This has that old school laid back late 90s/early 2000s vibe that I love from RHCP.
I thought this was a weird Al video 😂
Gracias...
My favorite band🥰🥰🥰
I still think that mustache is ridiculous
brutta Canzone
My fav song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
From London to Medellín. We love you. This is the good stuff
Yoo this song sucks. Tired of hearing it on the radio
Anyone else getting sea shanty vibes from this song at times? Still great, DGMW. Shout out to Josh. Welcome back John. Just gotta see them live in concert sometime.
1:52 dancing around the melody and saving the song...
Love this! I'm glad you guys are back
jeje Obi Wan references ;) love u Red Hot
Leyendas aquí y por siempre, he estado esperando a que ese verano negro termine
this is like back to the old good times!!!!!!!!
❤️
Flea reminds me of that homless man named Dennis who pops his false teeth out to scare children in every northern City in the UK.
มายเฟรนด์.ไอ้ ติ่ง ติ่ง ต่อง ต่อง โอ้ มาย เฟรนด์
Good song😎😄🐕5 years later no red hot chilli peppers good recordings😭💓
Esta banda e phodastica!!!
как всегда прекрасно
Who was it that wrote the lyrics? Raven Kreetion, cainecrawford, horusvanhellsing, sethsayers? I can't remember.
Jó nagyon Jó !

Red Hot Chili Peppers no Brasil  #redhotchilipeppersnobrasil #redhotchilipeppersnobrasil #redhotchilipeppersnobrasil #redhotchilipeppersnobrasil  #bora
Your Guitarist/Since I play Guitar/ Is a Legend and Huge Influence. I'll be sure and add him to my list of Favs/influences.  Greatest thing about your band is this you guys!!  Not One Musician Gets Noticed in Band Individually. It's because you guys have such a tight fundamental dope signature sound! We've all come to know & rely on that.  Wish I would Not of Missed Free Show You Did Off of Santa Monica Blvd. Gardens Possibly. Heard via other person you guys played a free two hour show  I might of been near that area and missed show. It would of been a first. Been to close to 200Concdrts by now. I'm 53 Say what's up to Flea Rest of Band Especially my man on guitar.
Unbelievable Concept Production & Energy! Always impressed with The Chilly Peppers during any point in career/s. They've always cranked out great music and given off good vibes.   One of my own personal Favorite Bands Especially now that I live in LA Now. Been here since last Summer and Have Found Home & Family in LA and California on general. Needless to say but will sst it any way on behalf of Californians!
This popped my  Pepper Cherry. It developed after years of inactivity.
Finally it's not just rumbling sounds and drops like it is in a thousand other now day musics. It has got melody and style and tells something substential.
🙏🏼
Réd hot is complet. Full in french. I love josh so.
Jojo
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
John Frusciante is back! Wow impressive .
La mejor banda con diferencia del resto
solo reminds me of blood sugar sexx magik
Some people are annoyed by the inflection he does I personally love it.  Makes the song interesting.
Got a spot 4yoy guys baby. Belmo d.
excelente tema muy bien 10 very good!!!
It's just totally awesome !
Espectacular tema. Inconfundible sonido con aroma 100% a RHCP. Otra canción con visos de convertirse en legendaria, y ya tienen unas cuantas….
I remember seeing the chili peppers in Cincinnati Ohio at Riverbend in 2000 when Californication came out. My best friend got hit in the face with a drumstick to that said song. Good old days then we thought we were invincible.
Jojo reference???

Qui aime toujours autant la voix d'Anthony Kiedis que moi ? J'ai l'impression de revenir 20 ans en arrière.. Au moins ils sont toujours là
Can't stop addicted to the shindig
sometimes i come back only to listen to the jimmy hendrix style guitar solo it’s amazing
incredible john fruciante
Rock on Johnny Boy,     You’re on with some of the most talented bands in History.      WHO SAW THEM AT WOODSTOCK’99?    If ya dunno,     Now you know
White summer is back!
Probably the only person whose image doesn't take damage when seen with a mullet.
My biggest sadness is definitely just getting to know rhcp better now, I could have seen this song released
genios!!

The story of Frusciante is pretty insane. Glad to see the dude back on tracks.
How many different hairstyles has Anthony had over the years? Too good.
Totally digging the 70s porn stache
It's smells like red hot chili peppers again!
VIVA RHCP
La única canción buena del disco, junto con These are the Ways. Yo no sé com tiene tan buenas valoraciones. Y no, no es por meter hate, me encanta los Red Hot Chili Peppers pero creo que el I'm With You, el Getway y Unlimited Love, son los peores albums de los Red Hot
I am the only to thinking he looks like JON BERNTHAL at 1min42 !?
I hear a strong emphasis on all the R's
will ferrel on the drums
it is amazing how kieds keeps his belly flat even becoming older
This is quite possibly the worst chili peppers song.
RHCP became a mature band. When I was child, I loved listen the RHCP and jumping around in my room. Now I listen in my car and song make me relax and chill. For me, RHCP not hot and spicy like before. but still make me stick in.
The song is quite ok but I can’t stand the affection of the singer.
It could have been a song good song. Too bad it didn't take the time right good lyrics.
This song has grown on me. WAITING ON ANOTHER BLACK SUMMER TO END!!!!!!
Nice to see Anthony is nearly finished killing the integrity of what was once a great band.. especially “Uplift mofo… and “Freaky Styley”. John plz go back to solo guitar albums…..we’re begging!
Muito top … aliás as bandas  amadurecem
Play the truth, friends...play that truth
The guitar makes a big difference in Chilli Peppers. Without John, it's just not the same.
Most bands change for the worse as they age. Chili peppers is aging like a fine wine.
LOVE Them Ageless and Amazing ****
esta sin duda es una de mis canciones  favoritas despues de Under the Bridge... ❤
Temazo!!
Red hot chilli peppers
OmG I can believe they are back😍
this is a masterpiece.
Well come back John
Thanks for evnoring me
Ha ha ha. no cambian estos pendejos.
My fave lineup
São os melhores
Unlimited love from red hot chili peppers for bd🇧🇩🇧🇩
Incredible glad to see John Frusciante is back!!
"russia's on the dark side of the Moon!" 💙💛
My God that Frusciante solo is Dead F'n On!!
Te quiero mucho John frusciante
Is...is that a...mullet?

This song has been eluding me for so long. Finally I know what this awesomeness is.
best song of this album
Thank you
This song brought me back to them. 🖤
I feel it. Nice.😁
I CANT COMPREHEND HOW COOL THIS IS EVEN AFTER LISTENING TO THIS SONG FOR MONTHS!! I luv it 😭❤️❤️
You would make the same song if you would be no famous and had no money in the bank, thats why I (I think we) love you guys. Keep it that way!
Keanu Reeves plays guitar for Peppers.
🤓😎❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Still gleaning the cube. ♥️
I think I saw the appearance of Kurt Cobain
Too good, Love you RHCP❤❤❤
If i told what hapend to me a year ago that this Song talks about,probably no one would belive me.OZ.
i didnt ask for your number and I didnt give you mine... my friends arent lame
Love the track. Just can't take Keidis seriously though, a weird mix between a 70s adult movie star and Steven Seagal.
Y'all are so talented. I just love listening to your tunes.  ❤️
It's going to be insane at a live concert!! Come to Israel! We are waiting on another black covid era to end, and the live show to come to Israel again!!
Kiedis and his way to move, a magician :)
I hope with all my heart that they come to Latin America as soon as possible....maybe at the end of this year ♥️♥️ we are waiting for u guys!!
for the first time in a long time i'm excited to hear songs like this . .. . wow!

Favourite RHCP vibe coming back 💜
The same blabla since 1999 🤑🤮
Surprised this song isn't racist lol
Anyone else think he sounds exactly like Jim Carey doing karaoke in cable guy?
Sounds like AK comes from Cornwall
Flea is such a character.  He kills me.  I bet he's a blast to just hang out with and bullshit with.
Aaa

What's top top perfect  ...

Как я ждала их возвращения!!!!!!
I'm looking so much forward to see you guys in Cologne soon! FINALLY 🥳
Please Never chaging
I feel like the time machine has returned back to the 90s
Nunca me imaginé ver un sarape de Saltillo en la mejor banda 🙌
God John Frusciante 🙏🙌🙌
needs a flute solo.......
OFMD vibes anyone?
The ship's sails and the wind blows north from where the ship's no longer float in the brooks were we once long ago lived from the barren sea to barren land in the north country.
Omg I cannot believe that the best guitar player on the world came back to RHCP 😍 my heart is melting while listening to these reefs 🥰
👍👍👍👍
nostalgic tune...still rockin..best banned i ever know
Such peace. Much wow! RHCP stays true to their core. Also, JF rejoining the band is the best thing that has happened in a long long time!
Só lança música top!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Wow.. they are still together..
Punchy drums and killer bass line love it !!
Good to see Anthony only looks better with age.  Great job on sobreity!
Anthony, dear sir, I can’t say that I love the new approach. Maybe if you were a folk singer, singing tales of elves and orcs and shizz.
Mr John frusciante, my all time favorite guitarist, I’ve always hoped he’d get better and get back to killing it with that amazing talent. Love these 4 legends.
Love will Farrell in this!  RHCP back on top baby, keep up the hit making :)   California wildfire smoke is the black summer.
Look how loud John for this one..
Love it!
I would love to see them in a regular show episode, even if the show ended, I think rhcp would suit the best or maybe in a close enough episode, I think it would be amazing
Fam from Brasil 👍🇧🇷👏🎵🎶🎸🔊
I like them because they used to do Herion
This song deserves more views, love from Cyprus!!
Que nostalgia, lembrava da infância, jogando bola na rua ouvindo RHCP na caixa de som, soltando pipa,
Real Goat RHCP Band and Songs still Strong
best of best...guys i wish you luck the luck what you newer sean and this music newer ends

Immediately fell in love with the song. Flea and John, incredible

Nice, but when you’re old you should hire young attractive actors for your videos
Very bad live concert in sevilla. They really bad musicians. I am dissapointed

Música de verdade! This is RHCP

парни спасибо что вы есть, всё ваше творчество шедевр, вы и есть само  искусство gracias y thanks
Love the Red Hot Chili Peppers . This video makes me think of Randy Marsh for some reason
WTF happened to Danny Trejo!!
I hope tik tok won't discover this 🙏🙏🙏
This is a sea shanty. No punk. No funk. Where did they go?
didn't know john wick played guitar for RHCP
Eu amo esses caras. 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I'm just glad it's not another California California California California California California California song
Glad to have new music... but I can't be the only one hurt that they kicked Josh out of the band?? I understand John was their guitarist for a long time, but Josh had been playing with them for almost a decade, man! You can't just cut ties like that
he plays Obi Wan Kenobi 3'rd episode :)
Nice video
class
Es como un regreso en el tiempo los red hot que nos deslumbraron a todos tantos años atrás
Bem que podiam vir ao Brasil.
I was in Junor High and High School in the 1960s. I loved the music from that era also some from the 70s and 80s, but I never liked Punk, Funk and Rap. I have finally connected with some new music. Black Summer is Milotic and has some great guitar riffs. The singing and Lyrics are great for the time as well. Good job RHCP, two thumbs up!
pake kumis kirain d chuck norris yg jd vokalis 😁😁😁
I love them as long as I live God bless the world 🌎🙏❤♥💖
Temazoooo!!!!!💪🔥🎸
gracias RHCP esto es como si fuera ayer. 😭😭😭 .
The peicanz are pruning
"The platypus are few." RHCP 2024.
They’re back, and they’ve aged like fine wine 🍷
Ant is always in shape lol
This music video looks like a meme to me
Anyone else thought the first line was: "A laser in a mine" ?
RHCP love you guys😭😭😭😭
A 0:46 il dit Eminem???
better than ever
I love you, I can't wait to see you at the concert. LOVE YOU
Red Hot chili Peppers marcou muito minha vida
Oh,black summer of China..
Чисто в своем стиле! Красава, тряхнули стариной) Пушка)
Anthony looks like Reg Regan
Mir gefällts mit Wiedergabegeschwindigkeit x1,25 noch besser :D !!!
Was he trying to go for a badly autotuned sound?   It definitely was tuned (open up the isolated vocals in any pitch correction software and observe the square waveforms perfectly snapped to the scale if you don't believe me).  But why? It's possible to tune it without the Cher thing.  If he wanted the Cher thing, why not lean into it rather than just a few random phrases?
PLATYPUS ARE FEW...
Vuelven a hacerlo ... Larga vida a RHCP !!!
directed by the same woman who directed the kenobi star wars shows. dont know if this a good or bad thing
This is by far my favorite song from the chili peppers
Long live the hippy
Barz
What!!! I'm i dancing  to this song🤘
China's on the darkside of the moon and Flea is in a galaxy far far away. 🤣🤣 Great new music from the guys, I like it.
Хоть херню и несёшь против русских, всё равно люблю и уважаю. Тебя надо обратно к нам на Байкал, там развернешься, окрылишься, новые хиты замутишь 🤘😎
Many years past by  People changes, world changes,environments changed but flee never changes 😭love your energy sir😭❤❤❤❤ Please pin 😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭You guys made my life😭😭😭😭😭❤
Vincenzo "Vinny" Santorini just releasing bangers on the side of the flower shop business I see.
sry, too honest. ty you bring me hope to know that the future is golden
wow how you get it still is it infinite your like a 15 year old 60 year old
I haven't seen them in forever... heroes do grow old...
it's a good song for sure but he sure does look a lot like Eddie Guerrero from WWE
I remember listening to them when I was young, because of my dad I know about this band. This the the peppers I remember haha
amazing how joe frusciante, after all his years of drug abuse suddenly looks like the youngest and healthiest of them!
I fucking love this song
Joy , Joy , Joy
Amazing.
1:52
I don’t know any other lead singer who is so consistent.  Anthony Kiedis hasn’t lost any range/sound with age.

Red Hot Chili Peppers was the best rock concert I have ever attended. And I've been to dozens! They whip up their magical tunes like Shamans.
Love this song even though I have absolutely no idea what it's about.
Sonds like  Monster Magnet ♠️
This band ages like fine wine
Wow I love it
They are getting old...but, their music...their clothing style... They never change...so nostalgic 😄
*_is it me or does he sound Irish at the beginning?_*
Awesome like always keep it up guys
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
How my heart leaps whenever I see John Frusciante ❤️
Frusciante is a complete beast in this song
O início dessa música se parece muito com uma outra música que eu não sei qual kkkkkk Mais alguém?
thank you
Waou i'm french and i follow thé  réd hot since seriously 3years and this sound is pure like i des cover them.
my boys, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS🔥, see you in Florence❤️ qualcuno che viene a firenze?
Awesome psychedelic guitar lick.
Best song ever.
rhcp это моя любовь на всю жизнь, думаю, когда сдохну, эта чёртова музыка будет играть вечно, на моей могиле, и я буду в раю или в аду, но я буду слушать её везде! спасибо вам любимые перчики, вы в моём теле, в моей душе!
So glad to have Frusciante and Rick Rubin back❤️
Hitler has a pretty cool band.
Excellent song by Red HOT chili peppers. They're like fine wine. Getting better with age. 🍷
These are the best members of the band. Glad to see them reunited
Sevilla
Musica nova?
Gods
this song is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see yalll still killin it out here 🙌 💯🤟
YEAH
Música dos meus sonhos 💕💕🎼🎶🎵🇧🇷
Will Ferrell really rockin out on the drums.
Red Hot Chili Fruciantes
That solo is phat, expressive, and a chained beast let loose
God bless you mother f****** I love you so much love forever and always from the Sun
Ah, now I see why Flea is in Obi Wan. Deborah directed that entire series and she directed this too.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Com todo o respeito as outras músicas, essa é a melhor do álbum
Sem dúvidas, uma bela música, ouvi muito e vou ouvir.
The peppers without John aren't the peppers. Glad to see him. Also this was foreahadowing the Obi Wan series :)
The verdict is that rock is not dead, it's just that there aren't a lot of bands writing to everyone
나를 만족시키기 못한 현대 노래들 사이에서, 유일하게 낭만을 준 노래..
This masterpiece is future RHCP classic, for sure
Is it me or does Anthony's voice sound different ? In a more annoying way lol
So old but so ......
2:50
Will ferrel(lookalike) at drums kicks ass
Gracias por existir RHCP!
Beat bass player in history
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That solo tho!!! Definitely sounds like Jimi Hendrix
Why is Will Farrel Drumming? what happened to Chad Smith?
The only new thing in this song is Anthony’s horrible singing. It sounds like a fake Irish accent trying not to sound Irish. It takes me out of the vibe of the music. The music part is normal RHCP, nothing really stands out.
This band never gets old. It’s crazy how long they’ve been around to still make great music. I will always love this band
its incredible to have all the team together, there are no words to explain how it feels to listen great musicians playing a 70s groove like this on present its so refreshing
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I can't believe these guys have been making music since 79' signed in 83' flea & Tony are born in 64'
FANTASTIC!!!! LEGEND!!!!!! THE BEST!!!!!!! 🔝 🔝 🔝 🔝 🔝 🔝 🔝
Still rocking 🤘🏻
Increíble como a pesar de los años siguen sonando tan bien.. eternos red hot
FC.John Frusciante  From Thailand 🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Comming from seeing first and second cap of Obi wan serie, just to let you know that Flea performs a criminal on that serie. That's because Deborah Chow (director of this videoclip) is the director of the serie, so she invited flea to make a cameo... It was cool to see both of my passion in one place: Star wars and Red hot chili peppers..
Anthony got a nice jacket
Awesome
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What t he high hells is this?? The IRISH ANTHEM?!
1:52
I just saw Flea on the new episode of Obi=wan
This is The Red Hot Chili Peppers. ❤️ Chills throughout the entire song. I've wanted this reunion for so long and I couldn't be happier that it's happened.
I been loving this song.  At first I was like...sweet! A new RHCP tune...then he sang and I was like...wait a minute...that sounds Irish...then the chorus hit...and whammo! back to RHCP.  Crazy head trip.
What's up with Anthony and his mullet? Well at least it's better than that Karen hairdo I couldn't even look at him with that shit😂
Making my night better
Vladimir Lenin en el bajo de flea,  Genial .
20 лет прошло, но я все еще люблю их творчество
Nossa que foda escutar essa banda depois de tantos anos e sentir a mesma vibe foda.
Thank you RHCP
.........And China's on the dark side of the moon.........and the RHCP on the white side of the moon........!!!!!...sempre.....!!!...som inspirador.....!!!!
que riiiiiiiiiiii coooooooooooooooooo
Instant classic!
Amazing , so good .
Nunca había tenido una banda de rock preferida, no hasta hace poco que los he venido escuchando, conociendo su historia, son ejemplo de superación y resiliencia y más aún estando totalmente vigentes con su mismo estilo característico. Realmente admirables. Me encantan!!
This song is so dope I expected more views, lol, if you don’t feel loved I love you 4 life.
First song I listened to was under the bridge when I was 16.. And here we are 2022. I'm 44 yrs old nows.
Wow..
Inner Joe Exotic  feelings
Tell me how crazy I am that this song seems so similar to The Highwaymen by Johnny Cash, Wellie Nelson and others
What do i play after that?
Кайф для моих ушей. Спасибо за возвращение! Всё будет Украина 💙💛
John Solo..... Awesome
Hi
Why does the singer looks like an old Chinese kung fu master ?
Chad: I'm not sure what to do here...I guess i'll do the same beat i do in every other single Rick Rubin: Perfect, no one is paying attention to you bro
you guys , welcome back!!! 🇯🇵
I thought they all overdosed on some batshit crazy stuff,or they've been resurrected
I don't get tired of it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song captures the feeling of the Pandemic best.
When did they get Keanu Reeves to play guitar? 🤣🤣
What a brilliant band. This is an awesome track, dare I say, one of their best. Its amazing how they come up with all this new stuff which sounds so good and fresh but retro . Just love the chili's, especially now John is back. Love them to death!
RHCP is a band to hear with headphones. All members of the band are great. But Flea... Is a MASTER.
UL is good, but really not great. The thing with RHCP till Stadium Arcadium was that the last 1-2 minutes of their songs they were at their best, even a level higher then earlier in the already great songs. That is what this album misses for me, the euphory that they had in the past to end their songs in a classy, powerful way, when they kick it up a notch or 2 extra. Now it is just nothing mesmerizing they end their songs with, wich is sad, the most songs on UL feel like they die out towards the end.
Good song
Просто нет слов я слушаю эту песню не переставая, самое лучшее что случилось за последнее время ❤️😘
Thank you for nourishing our souls with your music. Long live RHCP!!
It's so much worse than the last album.
Will Farrell looks great
Spanning the ages better than your average great apes!   Keep this train going through the ripples in spacetime as we drift along faster than imaginable.
Red Hot Chili Peppers!😍 We can always count on you for your authenticaty and supreme talent! Love this song, and am so excited to hear the rest of the album. Thanks for bringing back great memories and nostalgia along with more awesome music!!!
Whys his voice sound like that? Whys hes moving like that? Do kids like this music?
another simple but so powerfull guitar solo
Time takes its toll on everyone.  It's time to live
Maravilhosos 🖐️😭
You know it's a classic RHCP song when you hear it for the first few times and it feels familiar (in a good way!) like it's been around for years.
so happy to hear John Frusciante back in the mix. The new album sounds great and the guitar is next level
I just can't get enough. The new song with a sound of old times. That nostalgy! 💥❤️ Thank you guys!
59 years old anthony O_O
Anthony totally reminds me of Falcon Hoof from Adventure Call (Limmy's Show) particularly on the second verse - the running in place, the archer, the green screen! Can't unsee it now.
you are still in good shape
Glad to see Frusciante back in the band, Flea and Big Cat sound even better now!
Solo gave me slane castle vibe
Feels like I've known this song for years...maybe that's an indicator for how true to their sound they remained
Heard this recently and thought it was an older song I hadn't heard before. Sounds just like RHCP from the 90s.
👏👏👏👏
I'm the only one that needs to give more likes to this video??? Click here if you feel the same.
My life, real for rhcp.
" GLOBAL WARMING VEGETABLES "
Excellent song.  Kudos!
Exitazo! No pierden el toque! ❤
só falta sair em turnê
Welcome home John
Sounds good😎
Sea shanty sounding ass
Frank Gallagher
Has no one noticed that Anthony looks like Joe Exotic?
VAMO LO PEPPER
Has that awesome 90s music sound to it 👍
Hai Red Hot Chili Peppers - Video Red Hot Chili Peppers - Black Summer (Official Music Video) Yang Kaka Buat Ini, Kreative Banget Kak. Thanks Ya Atas Videonya...
They still got it 🖤
I heard some critics say nothing new here....ummm you bozos still don't understand that the RHCP have nothing to proove, THEY ARE 2012 HALL OF FAMERS!!!!", what are in these critic's cranky hostile ears!!!!!  This album has it all....I love every track!!!!!  I get chills from the thrills on this album... "She's A Lover" and "Here Ever After" are hot!!!!! I love "These Are The Ways"  and "Black Summer" too!!!!!!
DUDE! I can't believe John frusciante rejoined the band! This is the RHCP I know and love.
Они крутых
The style of Frusinante is here !
Such a intense legendary moves
Finally, some good music
Everything John puts his hand, tô.turns to Gold.
Thank you for your music. I don't wanna die. Save my world
I so gotta watch this on acid😂🥰💊
He kind of looks like ben stiller from dodgeball and johnny depp in pirates of the Caribbean morphed together lol 🙃
I didn't know Keanu Reeves was on guitar and Will Ferrell on drums ???
First off...how does frusciante look the least weathered ? Second..I've read through 30 or so comments and not one comment about Anthony's hair mustache combo ????? All that said, damn good to hear some chili peppers 😁
I have been following you from my second day of life
whoa a jojo reference
Who in the world would have okayed this song...it's terrible. Uninspired three-chord progression and to top it off they look ridiculous. Ugh!  So...they've become sailors now., er...matey... ?
I love it!
If this dude is not turning women in jackets from his mothers basement I would be SUPER surprised. Banger Song though!
John❣️
Great a song
This album is gift for the old fans and new ones. Thanks guys!
What happened? Is this a joke? Seriously, disappointing.. literally think this album is a joke
I love the subliminal conservative lyrics 😊
"Crack the flaming whip, sailing on a censorship. riding on a headless horse to make the trip"
"the night is dressed like noon, a sailor a spoke too soon, and China's on the darkside of the moon" ThE mUsIc iS sO gOoD" its all about the lyrics to me
They are gaining that rock'n'roll dinosaur status, but this does not have any prehistoric shit on it. My gods what a banger
ak your superficial environmentalism is killing me. the way they made a 14 year old speak of lies and you think she weighs a ton, none of the sht you mentioned in the song wasn't man made. gullible sucker.
🔥🔥🔥
I cannot believe John is back. The first time I've   heard this I literally cried. It's like I came back in time❤️
Childhood favorite band. Loving the new album
LEYENDAS!!! 🤴
Soo good.
The whole albums is just so good! the sounds are instantly nostalgia worthy.
When you know their personal history and watched them makeing another great art together, with the good teste and love to the music - you are able to see their souls.
Delicia de música
These guys are so back!
Will always be my favourite song.
Anthony  kiedis looks like he just came from filming peaky blinders.
Hector Bellerin
I fucking love the peppers
Joe Exotic???
That is a great song, I don't care how old you are.
God, we missed some Frusciante.
j adore!
Have listened to RHCP since 1989 (Kids, getting old sucks so enoy your youth) and this song takes me back.. I´m a sucker for the first 1:30 so that gets repeated 9-10 times every time i listen to this.. Love from Sweden 💚🤍
Heard this today and it took me back to   90s and 2000s summers.. and it’s not even an old song lol but now all I want is nostalgic music
Old goat trys to stay young. Thats impossile.
Не позорьтессьь
really don't like the twang in his voice he uses on some bits of this song. really makes it unjoyable.
Lookin like brad from wolf of wall street.
ROCK IN THE VEIN🤘🤘🤘
😁🖤
Bro I love this song (first one i beard by them)
Cool
Incredible band
love you guys
Doesn't that sound like "Cheetah"?
lead singer has incredible physique for his age . good job keepin it healthy
I love This ! Keeping It Real To There Sound.
They're dedicated to their craft like no other band.
It's very good song👌👌🏻👌🏼👌🏽👌🏾👌🏿
60 años de puro poder .
I think it’s one of the best songs of 2022 if not even of 20’s already. Didn’t tired after hundred times.
Et le son de John, intact, irremplaçable ❤️🙏
Pour toujours, ils restent mes Héros ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’d greatly appreciate if you would please check out my latest singles  “Red Rocket” https://youtu.be/MqfRORxwVbQ  “Walk with me”  https://youtu.be/D6LXWXaxGtU

I can't believe they're in their 50-60's and still putting out these bangers, damn
❤❤❤❤
This is their best song ever. Keep Playing it over and over and over. Amazing. Can’t wait to see them in September. 👍
Cool song. Time to lose the mustache 👍
Loved these dudes since forever

Nope.
Wow
Simplemente genial estos musicos tocan con el alma.

不错。听到词和曲风就感觉是中国摇滚风
автор молодец!!!
Ich liebe den Song ...er ist einfach hervorragend....😍👍🏼🎉
We all needed this one ☝️
And China's on the dark side of the Mooooooon
Dope shit 30 plus years
Que nunca se acabe la buena música hecha por estos señores
God blessed me w 34sardeens and a Spanish mackerel today,mco
seems to me like Anthony is hating on John for being the one to carry the band
Nice!
i started shaving the sides of my head, never been happier
what on earth?
Best ninja singer ever.
Absolutely love this song.
Nice John Frusciante!! 👏👏👏
It's like when all the Power Ranger Zords come together to form the Megazord and you just stand there in awe of its power and beauty.
this is beyond sick
Red Hot é show.
It was in the 90's when my high school buddy introduced me to RHCP, and I immediately loved it. Then it was 1999. Californiacation was out. I went to university in Shanghai. Got hooked up with some other dudes and we started a rock band. We played RHCP a lot. The gear was shitty and so were we. But nevermind, we had a lot of fun. Then we graduated. Started working. Put all that rock band shit behind us. I broke up with my girlfriend. Met someone again.  Changed job. Got married. Had several kids. Lost my job. And then Covid came. Now I'm in quarantine at home for 48 days. All my bandmates are busy with their own lives and we rarely got in contact nowadays. I don't know how they feel, but to me, playing RHCP with them in a shabby rehearsal room back then was the best part of that time. It's 2022, these four are back together. The show goes on. And I'm thinking, perhaps the world ain't that bad after all. Thank you, guys!
This is the only chili peppers that I need 🌶️
If anyone says guns n roses is better im Gonna suicide
Mto obrigado por fazerem minha pré adolescência  ,adolescência  e faze adulta feliz ...Obrigado RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.
Sooo...it's 1:13 in the a.m. & I'm just leaving my Wawa. I'm grown now, so the Radio Tunes of Today & I DO NOT VIBE like we once did in my past life. Since I'm damn near at home, I let the thing play because my mind IS 25.5 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE I BE right now! Within 60 seconds, a few words in, the catchy melody & that voice...INSTANTLY SET OFF MY RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS RADAR! I know my boys & their unique sound. I'M SMILING! I know I'm late, but BETTER LATE THAN NEVER, RIGHT?! WOW! I must say that I'm grateful that my parents introduced me to real music instead of a damn television. My parents never discriminated when it came to the person/s who introduced us to a new, amazing & profound sound & for that reason I'm able to appreciate the greatness that is MY RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS AFTER all these years (1991-present) Damn, I feel sorry for these kids today who are clueless to the sound of a real band.
guitar jesus has returned. this track is amazing.
This album gave me Californiacation vibes 💯
He turned his nice native hair into a mullet. Bruh...
This song is a summary of RHCP unique sound!
John l'âme des redhot....
Smoking hot - the soul of rock Is still very much alive
Great to see frusciante back in peppers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwOUcZgVLKs Still My favourite song... When i listened to this first time, i just said... OH MY GOD...
A Band that has a UNIQUE sound must be a Genious band. The RHCP are. The Beatles, were, the Doors, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Metallica, U2, etc... The RCHP are still making GREAT SONGS... They are Masters...
Ich fand es toll nur der Anfang war ein bisschen langsam
some good vibes here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4bQhljZQBo
Excellent physical and professional form you have guys !!! You are not getting any fat on body or brain,  so that is the example for all the fans!!!
Stayed true to their badassery, their sound and the artistic flair...plus paid homage to the tragic passing of TH, rip during their performances... l e g e n d s
Beautiful, sounds so much like the old tracks❤️
Come on Pat Finnerty, this surely needs to be featured on your channel 😂
Kiedis turned into Borat
แนวเพลงคุนมันสุดยอดอยู่แล้ว
Thank God for a music video
Ohhh that guitar….man he can sure make it talk welcome back….this song is a masterpiece!!!!🍻
I’m declaring It now. RHCP is the greatest band of all time. 4 humans, coming together like Sugar, Salt, Water, and Magic to give our minds, hearts, and souls nourishment. This is the meaning of life. Music, Movement, Feeling.   This song captures all of that.
sing along LYRICS LYRICS LYRICS LYRICS....

Melodic and soul touching, then they add a good jam session. Have been needing this for years. Great vibe, We are blessed to be witness.
Simply great, great ,great...
No words to express the delight to see the legends back. Infinite Love to bring a smile on my face everytime when i listen to RHCP from my childhood. Thank you so much for every new song ❤❤❤

Ok but can we talk about how pretty this music video is?
Dr Disrespect is so versatile haha jk this masterpiece is amazing
Does anyone else imagine k.k slider from animal crossing when hearing this song? Everytime it comes on that little singing dog is always in my head the way the vocals sound! 🤣
One the greatest band that inspire me (since I was 17 years old in 1990) to have my own band until now. And having still having them around until now give me no reason to quit in a band.
was skeptical at first but this is a good tune
🔥🔥🔥🖤🖤🖤🤘🤘🤘🇹🇭🇹🇭
What is JOHN WICK doing in this video?😀
...am I the only one thinking Anthony's talking weird in the beginning?? Like pronouncing things strange
Legenden !!!!!!!!!
It could be that their best song hasn’t been made yet… but will be coming soon…
きえええええええええ
This song sounds like it's from the 70s. I love it.
perfect 👍👍
Me gusta 👍🏼
Excelente
Pop
Gross sound, bruh
Grandes los Red Hot Chili Peppers la Banda del milenio
Songs great videos brutal. It's like a Saturday night live skit
absolutly love frusciante, the rest is just caca
my GOD they kill it everytime. they are back to BSSM days imo!!!
I'm obsessed with this song! 😁
The chilli's are back on top form!
sars from germany🏴‍☠
Not enough “ California “
Keren banget rhcp with john
Anthony with the voice Flea with the bassline Jhon with the melody Chad with the percussion  It's RHCP
Вот Русские ребята умели бы такую музыку делать, цены бы не было Гребню, Макару, да и многим нашим, у кого стихи красивые, ( тексты), ;у  импортных; пакля, ш пакля, рвал, тексты не очень, за-то музон....
MATE..... Y RHCP.....🙋‍♀️💖🎸🎶🎵
I'm really glad to see that even after all these years the fire of feelings inside your hearts still burns. A wonderful combination of legendary sound and lyrics.
1:23 take this as a message if your struggling with depression or stress :)
Nice MOUSTACHE
Always shut down 2  salt peppers 🌶villa
Freeeeeeezeee tag
There are so many RHCP songs that would sound wonderful played live with two guitars, both Josh and John. This is one of them.  "This Velvet Glove" in Chorzow, Poland was absolute perfection. Please bring Josh back. Be 5 instead of 4. Break the limit.
One word and you know it is from the RHCP : just love this new song ;)
Anthony Kiedis is 59 and that's what he looks like w/o a shirt.  Flea is also 59. Dude bounces around like he's 25.  Chad Smith is 60. What?????  John Frusciante is 52. One year younger than me.  That's fucking badass.
Heard this on the car radio and had to look it up. Usually  I listen to 60s and 70s stuff. But this caught my ear. Guess I am just a sucker for a fuzz box guitar solo. I like it!
New RHCP song to add to my Playlist... Sweet 💖
This song sounds to me like one that Joel from The Last of Us could sing during a cutscene… a sort of acoustic version. For some reason it makes me think of that.
What's with the fake accent? They've done way better!
This album is superb!!
Завжди коли хочу зануритися в спогади и чудовi часи,то слухаю  RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS.Дякую.
Anthony sounds like a Pirate XD
This shit is garbage.
Buen tema, pésimo video.

Absolutely love love love!! 💗my song of the summer for sure, the guitar puts me in a trance..great job guys!
Anyone in the UK always hearing this on Radio X haha it’s a great song though
This is a great song. I’m hearing influences from John Anderson, Gordon Lightfoot, Johnny Rivers, and Simple Minds.
Sooo good to have RHCP back, and I really LOVE this song.  But question....anyone else get a strong Jethro Tull vibe from this song??  I mean its Peppers through and through, but that first 30 seconds was very Tull..just sayin.
I love this song. Favorite from them
Is anyone else suffering sticker shock!   Wow I'm Shocked. Guess I'll pass on that Birthday gift!
USA is time to accept your second place, China is already on the dark side of the moon.
The solo damn. John one of the best to do it.
Шедеврально
All about the plasma apocalypse
ALMERIA ANDALUCIA ESPAÑA MAYO 2022.
GREAT!  Just finished Anthony's book Scar Tissue !   Such a good read that I now must read Flea's book , just to spend time with the RHCPs!
This is new!? Lol  I'm loving everything about this!
cuando escucho sta en particular solo me imagino en carretera ......el ocaso relajado conduciendo...
Ficou boa demaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaais!
I need to listen the others songs of Unlimited Love too... but... I will listen this one  just one more time... only one more... ok.... let's Infinite loop time begins !!! :)
Instant classic and song of the year.
John❤
New song,new album of 2022
anthony rocking some serious cool uncle vibes.
OMG, this is RHCP which I loved before
Everytime I hear those first few chords it's quite surreal. It's a reminder that John is back. Then the guitar solo...wow. HE REALLY IS BACK. Great backing vocals too. 🤟
Amo a red hot pero sentí q desde q se fue Jhon algo faltaba.Deje de escucharlos y de casualidad ví este video.Estoy flipandooooooooooooooooo necesito más de esto
Welcome back
nothing: people in the comments: somebody is listening in 2874 ?
🌦️
yes yes and just omfg yes!!! please proceed lads!!
these guys will always be part of my childhood ill never forget.
Love this!
Нормальная такая песенка,не разочаровали перцы!
I've literally been listening to them my entire life. Never gets old
I grew up with this band, not only are they my favorite band, they are part of my life, they are family!
OMG they sound better than ever, love it a lot!!!
My super heroooo....🔥🔥🔥🔥
ジョン・フルシアンテのギターは、世界一だ！！ カッコイイ！
Increíble ❤️
Johnny is back
John is the KING!
Good morning barefoot Lifestyle is amazing 👣❤️🙏👍👣 This is my Good morning to you 🙏 Hope you have a fantaic new Day, 🙏 From Norway 👍😎 https://youtube.com/shorts/zt9EH5QRsYs?feature=share
Imagine if Coldplay sings this as the bonus track for "Music of the Spheres" album
After all these years rhcp still producing music that could have existed this entire time.
Awesome song I feel that the song should have been longer though
Why they gotta articulate their words so much in the video? 😂
Listen in 1,25x
Where's the guy who put the lyrics ln his comment
Viva Josh Klinghoffer
Блин братаны не гоните на нас
This song is shit. So many RHCP cucks on here afraid to say anthing bad about king john. Klinghoffer was better
Finally… Love it! Clear sounds and extremely well played
I love the band.  But Mr Flea as always is making a solo since the begining. But i Love the Band. He is just a genious...
In Rock Music for me there were 2 genius... Jimi Hendrix on the guitar, and Mr Flea on the Bass... I Love RHCP. And John Bonham on the drums of course... And Jim Morrisson on vocals and lyrics...
am i time travelling ??
i wish you all never die.
First time I saw them was on the Johnathon Ross show.  Flea was playing upside-down, suspended by his feet.  They were playing "Foxy Lady". A hell of a way to introduce yourself to the UK.
You're a legend if you're still listening to this in 2022❤️❤️
Damn, they're so good!
Para mim a melhor música do álbum, parabéns RHCP.
The "Chilis" are back !! Amazing with John !!
Check out my Band "SPIN MY FATE"! ❤️🎸
Amo demais! Mas o convenhamos aqui no Br que o Antony lancou o o Chitaosinho e chororo
crap
WTH?! Why am I just hearing this! All love🦋
Great indeed
1:52 Not gonna lie, I cried at that exact moment on the day this video was released.  I just couldn't believe it was real. Still can't, tbh. Welcome back, JF ♥️🌶️
Muito Obrigado por existir
Love the way you know - i' will bless u for Gold
I'm getting an oakenshield vibe. That solo though. Replayed like 50 times. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else thought of Barry Chuckle?
Jonh frusciante se parece a jonh wick
I love that he’s back!!!
Бро!  Это фантастика! Я думал, что RHCP умерли с предыдущем альбомом, но я ошибся.... Вы вернулись!!!! Это охренительно! Желаю Вам дальнейших творческих успехов и радовать нас вашим творчеством! LOVE PEACE
Love this. Its remind me old, good times ❤️ Greetings from Poland
Oh man your foot is numb now and you're gone blind in one eye with signing up to
Weird comment- the ad I got on this video was the AT&T with Stafford about trades…. Can I just say how genius of a commercial that is.
Thats the REAL Red Hot
I live in the desert to his hits home
Anthony, Flea, Chad, John or Josh... you are so great! I love new albums so much. Stay healthy and let's feel the sound in the limbs for many years to come 🙏❤️
3 months later and I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE Frusciante is back. Can't wait to see them live.
Justin Long, Keanu Reeves, Sting, and Will Ferrell.
หนูๆเด็กๆอย่าลืมล้างมือก่อนกินข้าวนะจ๊ะ อา…หร่อย
Can wait to see you live in July - Cologne.
Red Hot Chili Peppers is by far the absolute best and most chillest group ever. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm 15 and I really think that I'll be sobbing yet also having happy tears listening to this at my house fence looking at the sunset when they will no longer be alive or making music anymore... thank you for showing me the great side of music RHCP forever!
So Malibu Pete had to be keeping playing it, Champion
Last album was the bomb and probably won't be matched again.  Shoulda kept both guitarists SMH 😠
Down w Malibu sickness
these lyrics have alot of my conspiracies in them. Just like Tool with Fear Inoculum
These guys really put in work their whole lives and it shows, still have fans waiting around for their music 37 years later
love it
Going to my first RHCP concert on Sept 1st , I'm SO excited 😃
Richtig geiles Teil
Verses 1000 out of 100 , chorus : 2 out of 100
Is this the vagina on the curbside song?
Just Awesome
Love It !!!🌈❤️⭐💙💛💜
Amazing man!!   Hey guys, I do Frusciante covers/jams as well. Check this inspired jam: https://youtu.be/wUG4AUznlug
This song definitively entered the masterpieces of RHCP
amazing song, good to hear RHCP songs once again
🔥🔥🔥🌶️🔥🔥🔥
So great solo from John 1:52
majestuoso ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
40 years of these guys writing hits.  RHCP is the most underrated and under appreciated band of all time.
🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️ 🔥 🔥 🔥 🤘 🤘 🤘 🤘 🤘 🤘 🤘
Utter trash
John is back—order is restored
RHCP4ever
Still Class! So unique from other bands and have cool hip and funky jive. I love em and my kids love them too. There was me thinking I'm uncool at 52 - we saw them first ;)
Was this song recently in a TV show or movie??  I swear I've heard it, but can't think of it.
Dude has this Keanu Reeves character about him.
Oh man, I heard the beginning of this, but damn you guys took it back to that arena
Tootsie roll it, yeah!!!
Just found out that this was directed by Deborah Chow, who directed Obi-Wan and some episodes of the Mandalorian!
Monsters
1:51 incredible masterpiece from John.
A lazy rain am I  The skies refuse to cry  Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon  A sailor spoke too soon  And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few  The secret life of roo  A personality I never knew (get it on)  My Greta weighs a ton  The archers on the run  And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend  Waitin' on another black summer to end  It's been a long time and you never know when  Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip  A-sailing on a censorship  Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend  Waitin' on another black summer to end  It's been a long time and you never know when  Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin'  I been waitin'  Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin'  I been waitin'  Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin'  I been waitin'  Waitin' on another black summer to end
This song is so wonderful and beautiful :) i love it :) (a61) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNC_bCCxL8
Great❤
Sounds like Hendrix
John is like Nacho Fries.   He jusr vanishes only to return when you crave him the most
This could be my favourite Red Hot Chili Peppers album. The past 2 weeks I’ve listened to the whole album at least once a day while driving around Toronto blasting it to the masses! I’ll be in the pit when you’re here in August, please perform The Heavy Wing for me and I can die a happy man.
Imma need them they keep making music just like that
Anthony’s dance style is so enigmatic. Been looking for more comments about it
copy paste
Man it’s like frusciante never left
From Russia with love
Amazing! Welcome back legends!
Thanks for coming back, friends. I missed your particular sound. You are one of the GOATs. What a beautiful sound! It takes me to younger times. Love you all, hug from Spain!
Ledgends
Black Summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After all this time it's still 100% RHC. I'll take the sound of a better time Alex for $1000 please.
This is going to be a black summer.
very simple solo, but I can't get enough!
bello tema!
anthony grows different lmao his body changes but the voice is still there
"Derk side of the moooooon"
❤
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wahou !!!!!!!!!
RHCP without John Frusciante is not RHCP. Since he came back, I recognize them
I've got million followers... I love it
Stay this was 🌶s
There back! So awesome
I love this f%cking video so much
The Peps as I'm calling them, and yes I'm calling them that.
Will Ferrell on drums
Every time I see the peppers, I can't help but think of Will Ferrell...the drummer looks like he could be his brother. It makes me smile.
Love It 😃👍🇺🇲💯
Whenever someone asks me something, now I'm gonna say:  "A lazy rain am I? The skies refuse to cry"   Lol
I just love that it makes me happy to see the whole RHCP one and together with such a hit
Red Hot Chili Peppers rock
He sounds like the head Swede from that episode of the flinstons
Que guitarra, Red Hot e sua versão original melhor banda como não se arrepiar. Sou apaixonada 💞 os caras são foda.
Anthony half-naked and traditional amazing RHCP music.
I could listen to this for the rest of my life and try to learn the beginning guitar riff ! This song is fire and the fact that they have kept making music even through really hard shit is amazing so congrats chili peppers 😁 and I swear age just passes them like they don’t age at all 😌
Best song of RHCP
Wow he is john wick
Sooo goooood 😭😭😭😭💓💓💓😘
Flea you are the man, look , riff, attitude, etc. w
Amazing!!!!
Que buena rolaaaaaa !!!!
The platypus are few, the secret life of rue = on all the drugs ever

This song is a success in the eyes of a fan or songwriter . Commercial and classic rhcp sound value . Well done . Every instrument
So happy you guys are back together 😁
Мы стареем но не стареем РХЧП удачи вам братья!

Buenisisisima.
This song is what rock NEEDED!!!!
One more time listening Black Summer is not a sin so here I am again for the 10000 time
That’s my childhood right there. Thankyou for coming back John

🔥🔥🔥
glad frusciante is back , his style and guitar sound is irreplaceable
FINALLY!!!!! They,re back!
God bless the chilli's still rocking it in 2022. The solo on this track is killer.
Not doing it for me, it sucks , are the boys over the hill? Still my favourite band
This      is your next Pink Floyd
TO BE HONEST THIS NUMBER IS THE BEST ON THIS ALBUM!!! THE REST .... NOT SO SURE!!! YOU CAN DO BETTER!!! REALLY WHATS HAPPENED???!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:17 🔱🔱
Even though its a new song it sounds like all the others👌👌👌
Frusciante is a genius
This song takes me back to stadium arcadium days....cant imagine its been over 15 years..
This song sounds like it could've been straight out of By The Way
John voodoo Chili Peppers ! So cool!
I think It's time for an RHCP movie ! Starring Justin Long, Will Ferrel, Ben Foster and Vincent Gallo!
Great track, truly terrible haircut!
eu amo vocês
This song has been stuck in my head for days lol I Fn love it!
Brilliant
Thank you so so much for real music!! :)
WOW! just WOW!!
いいな。豪雨の中で毛布に包まれる気分。その経験は今だ無いから、知らんけど。
RHCP style! The sownd...how they move ..🥰
❤️🔥🔥🔥🎶
One of the best guitar solos in recent days
****nas on the dark side of the moon or whatever he said lol
Vamo John Frusciante y RHCP, carajo!!!!!!
Under the Bridge / Californication vibes!!! I looove it !!!! Soulfood in this Time of 2022
On the yaugcht
This is what music in 2022 has to be
Earth has entered a "Dark ages" the sun has gone. That bright WHITE PLASMIC light in our skies today... That's not the same golden yellow sun we grew up with. There are many many patents in many countries on what is called a  su.n sim.ulator.  I.E. BO.EI.NG has many many paTents @the U. S. PATENT OFFICE. for what is called a sun simulator/ARTIFICIAL Sun 🌞   ___---__- stuff you should know-_-_---_-_"_
They figured out the Algorithm!
Muito bom ouvir hhcp
Why does he sound like Dolores O'Riordan?
The tone that JF gets on the solo is sick...great band great track
와 기타리프 미쳤네 쩐다
I never had listen to this type of music, but RHCP was always something special with its unique sound and style. Glad to hear this melody again.
Does anyone else hear a “land of the rising sun” type melody there?
Geniales como siempre
Wow
the ads actually got me here
RHCP For Life
THE WHOLE WORLD IS DYING OVER CARL WINSLOWS INTERVIEW AND HAPPENING U NEVER NO WIN
Mais do mesmo
RHCP are back, baby
The peppers will some day be studied as an example of how perfectly to evolve.  They stayed true to their sound while adapting and staying relevant to the times.  No other band has been able to do this like they have.  Amazing.
Flash for freedom ☮️
John out here bringing back the grunge look!
This is a masterpiece.
Sounds like he’s summoning Gordon Lightfoot
😋👂👍🎶🎶🎶🎙😲and music
What a relief to have Frusciante back!
RHCP... still rocking
it took me two months of loving this song to realize john was back. couldn't figure out why I loved the guitar work so much
👌yeah, still got it👍
No one standing alone behind the son...I can dig it.
Voltando ao top novamente com Black Summer rdcp👏👍
Chad is such a beast
el mejor tema de rock en los ultimos 10 años por lejos sin dudas
Listen to this song. After that listen to Californication  The guys don't lose their essence for decades...
Sono cresciuta con le vostre meravigliose canzoni!❤
Perfect 🤙 waiting on another black summer to END
Old schooll legend is back...👏👏👏
มันชิบหาย ฟังตั้งแต่เด็กยันแก่
Как всегда круто!
i woke up this morning with that song in my mind and i come to search :) great song!!!!
I love rhcp
anthony is already 60 years old but wow he has a physical shape that makes me envious I don't know how the guy doesn't do so as not to get fat when he is already 60
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZINGGGG!!!!!
Legendarios . auténticos.telentosos.creativos.originales .únicos . etc...
Como sempre sensacional que delicia de música! ❤❤
Timeless. Like always. My grandkids will probably be mentally playing this on repeat via starlink in 2100…
john tirou onda nessa. puro rock 'n roll... receba
Thank god ! They are back !
Absolute arse. Not remotely fresh - and are these tired old fuckers controlling comments and likes, so it only shows the pluses? What a load of anti-rock'n'roll wank
Black summer >>>> Californication
.
Когда очень грустно, слушал эти вещи.  многие не знают, что они здесь есть....... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odw2fQOQBFc&list=PLr40El_-h8dF9YzBigra7GFpEbh5NfaGV
Джордж Кх был очень хорош.... Слушал его... Но  Фрусчанте ВЕРНУЛСЯ..  ФАН... КЛАСС ГУД и т.д. и т. п.
What accent is this meant to be? It sounds like Welsh and English West Country with a bit of Irish as well.
its fucking twenty two and this band still alive, a legend
Fantástico!
what's Will Ferrell doing in the drums?
LOVE these guys! Always have Always will 😍
Had zero expectations and wouldn't have listened to the album until I heard John was back. Almost every track is amazing.
Super. Keremet 🤘🏽🇰🇿
Well...a band of real musicians who's creativity supercedes all the mainline dross we are having to put up with ....
Wow wow wow. First song I heard was 'aeroplane' when one of my fav guitarists Mr. John Frusciante wasn't in the band but I've been a fan since then, and they are fine wine. They just don't have a ceiling. I believe they formed in 88 (year I was born,) and to hear them like this STILL riffing in a harmonic purity is quite mentally orgasmic. Love all y'all. Thanks for choosing music for the soul today. - I'm going to get the guitar tabs n learn it now .
Legendary band
Thank you for not being Kid Rock!
China's on the dark side of the moon?
I been a fan as long as I can remember higher ground was one of my top songs followed by give it away now and suck my kiss
🏄🏻‍♂️
I love U RHCP ❤️ Since a little girl in the 90's so much memories thank you 🥰
Ok🥹
Sorry
Suaiaiauwqnxjziaaopaoa
Joe Exotic coming in with the head bangers.
Enjoy the blk summer
Do a collab with mike patton on this one. #love
John Wick killing it on guitar.
💜Thank You💜 💗May I, make it so I experience RHCP concert, thrice.💗  💓Sending out unconditional love.💓
Shiiiiit.  Same rhcp.fucking love. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
damn i always gonna love your music, when i working you take me to other placer apart my job :)
Still excellent!  https://youtu.be/fKO3TtHLzd8
incrível como Anthony Kiedis se mexe e dança como o Z-Maguinho do Piauí
When I was a uni student I used to jam with a few friends, one of them, James, was a big RHCP fan, he had the coolest style playing the bass - definitely influenced by Flea, and we jammed through many of their hits.. every time I listen to them I just remember those days, jamming, singing, enjoying youth. James bro, RIP. I ll always think of you dancing around with your bass guitar.
It’s like they picked up where they left off at the end of Stadium Arcadium!
Thank you guys. Fucking bass line.  Love it.
Love you guys.  Thank you Flee. .. So great 😊😊😊
BLACK SUMMER = SAVE THE EARTH
Iggy pop has let himself go.
Best band ever!! Amazing
Is this song about global warming? And are they referencing Greta Thunberg?
It is 2022. Can we not sync everything perfectly these days? This video has too many errors in production.
RHCP should open all their upcoming shows on tour with ‘Good Time Boys’ as sort of a celebration of reuniting. Imagine hearing that song opening a live show in 2022 🤯. Think about it Anthony!!!
2:18 mofo ruined a perfectly good poncho......
59 years? ! Truely ??? No! 29 years old!! Amazing.
I know this song is about the Australian wild fires but I've using it as hope and motivation to get out of my own head, stop being a recluse, and to break my depression after several years, hell,  even getting out and making some new friends again.
Holy moly 🤘
Hooked since the first time I heard it
I can't wrap my head around FRUSCIANTE being back that came as a total shock to me Nostalgia kicking hard rn
Божественно!
Excelente
Will Ferrell? Oh wait, no that’s Chad Smith.
John Frusciante is magic……
C u guy in Vegas in August  with a LA vibe. Was a Fair Fax Lions Pride
True it's amazing after so many year, I love it
Will Farrell still kicking ass on them drums! 🤘🏿
All the great songs they done over the yrs Anthony still doesn't own a shirt😂
Did I miss something!? When did John came back to the band?? But it's goood news!! :D
me fascina✨como entra el batero y ese ritmo q lleva durante el tema🙌🙌
Don't forget to support RHCP and John Frusciante on Spotify!
When John Wick hit that guitar solo 😫
John frusciante is indeed back.
Sounds  just like the song from 2018 King Richard movie.
brazil , red hot chili peppers and 1998 :)
John's guitar work is emotional and a incredible listen, I love the song but wait for him to kick in!!🤘🏻
Fantastico questo pezzo!
I love you....❤
And one day, Frusciante has come back. So time doesn't seems to passed
One love RHCP BEST
Я полюбил эту песню с первого раза и с каждым разом люблю ее все сильнее. I loved this song from the first time I listened it and I love it more every time
👌🍻
Great song!
Wasn't it called "The Summer of Love", but I guess this fits too, lets hope we don't have another one.
Great song and glad to have John back. His guitar vibes are so cool. Guys, you are the best fucking band on earth. And over so many decades.
I like the new look, mullet porn star mustache.. trend starter
Welcome back John! RHCP fan from Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Thank you guys but thank you so fucking mutch J.Frusciante.
Glad to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers still with that vibe, my man even made sure his hairstyle still match the same legendary status 🔥❤
Catchy, the vocals are pretty good to sing over an acoustic
Kiedis for 59 is in amazing shape
Anyone know why they have an Irish accent!
Is he supposed to be some asian ninja?
We would like it.  If we thought it was good.  ...
This is ultimate song. BEAST
Without P-Funk this wouldn’t have been possible - timeless sounds- 👏🏾
Welcome back bois!
welcome back john your home your blood the red-hot chili peppers are back we are ready now
Cheeeoooon! Boys are back in town 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Love it!
Love this !!!
Addicted to this song
I like si mucho.i m Uruguay , My name is Pablo bergougnoux. I losing from 1993
I wish red hot chili peppers in the Philippines! 🤘
Arthur Shelby? Kkk 🎶❤
Hands up who absolutely frigging loves this song? I think this is their best. Brilliant. Well done lads. The Reds' are back even better 😍 👍👍🤗
Подняли на строоенрие!!!!! спасибо! Ждем в гости!
Amazing track. Loved it. RHCP is an awesome rock band.
Unbelievable track
This proves the Stratocaster is timeless.
Inspired guitar work by John Frusciante.
Solo io avverto somiglianza in Black summer con la sonorità di Waiting for the sun dei Doors? Splendido album
,,strasno.....
I like that your guitarist is still a Karen and doesnt want to play in the rest of the muaic video as everyone else.
if been listening to it every damn day.
Frusciante is back !
Заебись
Is this the peppers "African child" ?
Ура Джон вернулся я все видеоролики их смотрел и этот смотрел с большим удовольствием буду ждать новых клипов
cade voces brasileiros
i think anthony will outlive the roaches guys, it's settled
This is SO them! I really love it!
Frusciante the best
✌️
Thanks for save my life RHCP ❤
The way things are today it's been a horrible year except when I first heard this song it reminded me nothing stays the same forever what a great song
its hard for me to see that i become fatter with every album they make but the music is getting better and better.... hooray to my belly and all of us
Legend punk band
los amo pxtxs
People follow various gurus like sadguru my only wish before gone from this psychotic world is that John Fruciante can be my guru. The legend who inspired me to pick guitar. Wish me luck achieving that.
🤩
Love RHCP, but this stinks.
Best song they have written in 20 years has that old school RHCP feel to it. Glad John Frusciante is back!
This is lyrically awful; more Tenacious D's Wonderboy than Chili Peppers. And the video is just odd. John's guitar solo is great and Flea's basslines are always fantastic. Good to see them back.
Great stuff once again
Who Is the Guitarist on ? OMW FUCKKKK i Love He's Back
This is just a jam , nothing more !
I mean, its somehow dedicated to John´s comeback. Beautiful
"...and China is on the dark of the moon"
Love this song so much❤️❤️❤️
Symbolism will be their downfall
One of Jagger Best!!!
Love it!
It's full of psychedelic and folk tonality that make it work. Superb rock.
Pretty fire bruh
Love it..!❤️ Anthony married me 😍😍
que temaiken loco, nada queria decir eso, no puedo mover la boca tengo la mandibula como un adoquin. Saludos desde Argentina, el mejor pogo del mundo
Love you so much, with love from Ukraine
Kazik kiedyś śpiewał "a najlepsza fryzura, jeśli jeszcze nie wiecie,krótko z przodu długo z tyłu i wąsy na przedzie" i to się tak na naszych oczach dzieje 👍
Erra nunca!!!
The way the red hot🔥 do no one does that.😎
The boys are back !
I'm so emotional with this harmony of them getting back together , they're so fcking creative
This song is incredible, I’m glad they’re back making great music.
Love them
Meskipun sudah tua mereka tetap energik...khas vokalis nya keren banget...cabikan bass nya sungguh indah...RHCP indonesia Bali
I love this so much but wish it had closed captions.
良い意味で変わらない。 他のバンドがどんどん形を変えて、古参が離れ新規が増えていく中で、彼らは古参にも新規にも愛される。大好きです。
thank you red hot chili peppers for everything....blessed to witness another godly album release... the legacy continues..love you all foreverrrr
I love this song!!!  Love belguim
That's 40 years of killer, cutting edge music - time to recognize that RHCP are clearly on the list of all-time legendary bands
Why does he sound like a Swedish dude who just learned English?
Flea is still "The funkiest white man alive".
They will be headlining all major festivals in 2023. You heard it hear first.
vocals autotuned too much, yuck...
One of the best song  ever? I like to see Frusciante's guitar again, the arrangements are Incredibles. Personally flea's Bass is the number one 💪
I've been breaking for lunch in my car so I can listen to this album in peace.  Black summer an obvious reference to wildfires in CA.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
Quem veio aqui dps da crítica do regis tadeu kkk
RHCP are a great band. A simple fact
Crayons Chili chaud Peppers
Offff
2022  EPICO !
Amazing, great to see they are inspiring my 11 year old daughter  Here she is playing her drums to this track 💃🥁😍👇🏻  https://youtu.be/sk1ZCFTcD4g
Великолепная) композиция и группа) Большой поклон за Ваше Творчество)
Why has he got an Irish accent?🥴🥴
I love how Anthony Kiedis’s mustache is iconic like Freddie Mercury’s, but at least to me it is ironic. More power to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I have nothing but love for their work over the years.
After all these years, the fact that they are still putting out legendary songs like that, it's amazing. Long live the Peppers!
I love Will Ferrell 👍🏾 ♥️
Great song
This song, It's Only Natural, Watchu Thinkin', The Great Apes and Here Ever After are the only worthy songs for me on the album. The rest is very meh :/
Joe exotic actually sings well!
Sumpah lagunya keren banget 🤩😁
gibber way john
В 90х слушал его песни хиты
The first 40 seconds of this song are just fire 🔥
Legends still at it LFG
Forever RHCP fan here. Really not feeling the latest album.
I love you guys, thanks for existing
O ROCK NAO MORREU
John like Keanu
QXAD !!!!!!!!!
I can’t believe how good this is. Anthony has to be one of the most entertaining frontmen ever.
Definitely one of the greatest bands of all time
Love It song 🤘🇵🇪
Holy. Just revealing the inverted world. The truth in those “clouds”.  Greta a politrickster. They just putting it all out there for the world to see and then mission accomplished. Classic occult wayz.
These dudes are badass
May they never die, cause their music never will!!!
Still here❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Iperboli.
woooooooooooow amazing guys !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Клааааааааас!!!!!!!
At 0:44, I really feel “JOHN IS BACK”
song of the year
The Chilli Peppers are back baby
A melhor parte é a linha do baixo. O restante é bem sem graça.
Evergreen, but “Californication style…”
Wow .
I can’t believe this. It’s like a breath of fresh air in 2022. I figured RHCP would have some rap beat and auto tune now a days. But no it’s late 90s RHCP style in 2022. Awesome!
🙏🏼❤️
I don't know why this video remind me a little of the zephyr song.
Makes me see hope,great role models n not pretentious
I'm a 80's rock fan. I was at the gym and this song was on and I was like "this song somehow sounds so nostalgic but it's a new song?" so I looked it up. I'm surprised they still make really good songs.
ridiculus
Fruciante HAS BACK. RHCP RISE FROM DEATH!!!
These are my brothers. Always there to pick me up. Rock me out, feel good, cry and jam. Love you boys! Rhcp4ever
Personally these guys are like a fine wine… with age they get better !!! Last few yrs Been putting out some of there best music in my opinion…. Love the old Peppers music but the current tunes are just great !!! It’s music not just slappin the bass or rappin on the drums !! Great music !!!
I love you john!!!
Chiles rojos Picantes god
Dear God, I love the Chili Peppers.
Escucho a los RHCP desde hace 10 años. En algún momento creí imposible el regreso de Jhon en la formación, cuando me entere de la noticia unos meses atrás lloré de la emoción y estuve mucho tiempo con una necesidad incontrolable por escuchar los nuevos temas. No me decepcionan, cada vez que los escucho me llenan de una nostalgia enorme y de una satisfacción muy grande. Ahora puedo morir en paz y ser feliz con ello.
MEXICO LOS ESCUCHA POR SIEMPRE
After this many years they are still able to keep their style wow.
they're band's gonna be 40 years old next year seesh
Bella canzone bellissima
If this album is what it means to have John back, they really should not have kicked Josh out of the band. Nothing against John F, he is an AMAZING guitarist, just not the best song writer.
RHCP Forever! :-)
fucking good,  as usual ❤
En Sevilla nos vemos
Thank you!
China on the darkside of the moon, Good !
They were a great band,   and they still are
I like how they at 2:51 get back together .... Love this band and happy that they are back again
This is the worst album in RHCP history.
ฟังไม่เคยเบื่อเลยวงนี้
red hot chili peppers can never die
en algún lugar del cosmos Mangel 🤟🏾✨
Right on! Hope you always know that your music is always getting better I loved it then and I love it now keep it going I believe in you thank you that you’re continuing giving everyone that satisfaction
Red hot revivendo o rock parabéns gigantes I FRON BRASIL
This song is so familiar. it could have been written in 1995 or 2022. That said, I like it a lot.
Pro grade, boys!
great band approaching their sound each day better
It's amazing that this band is not progressing musically at all, they held a 50-minute concert in my country! They took a lot of money and flew by helicopter, horror
This song would sit nicely on any of their albums
That bass player looks like the dude from Back to the Future.
Ottimo.  👍👍
brilliant
The only group that sounds like the 90´s,and we all loving it.
i like the song but i do not know about guitars ect. sounds good to me😀
C'est tellement frais et magnifique comme son! Magique! 💖👽🌌 Ça fait du bien d'entendre Red Hot Chili Peppers!
J'adore... Surtout merci à John Frusciante d'être revenu dans le groupe.
They took the chorus from Slow Cheetah and mixed it with an Irish Accent. I remember when Madonna started speaking with an English Accent. I guess it's time for Anthony Kiedis to step into the spotlight of pretension.  #BlackSummer
John Wick is such an underrated guitarrist
старые уже совсем эх...
Grup band yang dari muda sampai tua, dan masih hidup bersama 😎😎😎
https://youtu.be/BlXceGtvPoc
Me encanta esta canción 🤩🤩 lo canto con toda mi fuerza 😃 con la foto del amor de vivida que está en el cielo Nilton te amo
Semakin mateng aja Musiknya...
🌶☀️🔥
Not good, except for flea,John,Chad
This song is better than any drug out there best song for 2022 hands down
Only song on the album reminiscent of Stadium Arcadium.
Los quiero.....los necesito
why does the lead singer look like a combination of tyler connely and jon bernthal xD
❤️
Not only is this an amazing tune with classic Chili vibes but their timing is awesome. With all the BS  in the world lately,we really needed this✌🏻🤘🏻👊🏼😎
Why did you do a thing? Memory much fonder without this money grubbing atrocity...
👌👌👌
About Time!!!!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU  GOD BLESS
Frusciante playing some wrong notes in such beautiful way like only he can
👌✔✔
Is this song about 2020 during covid?
Wow....I'm 50 keep rolling
Is this song lyrics about nonsense nothing words? Like some wild riddle Only the Peppers man
Unlimited Love Album #1 around the world 🌎🔥👊
Elle est magnifique ♥️
Mr. Bungle is still ahead.
Excrement!
This is great and all but is nobody going to mention the fact that Anthony Kiedis openly admitted to having inter course with an underage girl?
I hate his mustache!!!!! Lol
We are Family! Love and Understanding, Funk Style and Attitude🎶🎇🌊❤
Buenísima rola
What a powerful song.. so well written with some subtle differences RHCP never disappoint
WE LOVE YOU! ❤️
Its Ok
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
❤️❤️❤️
Love this. The solo at the beginning reminds me of Traffic’s version of John Barleycorn, or just a beautiful Irish ballad
Soo fu..cking boring! Nothing new! Thumb down!
Magia
Ленин жил, Ленин жив, Ленин будет жить!!!!
самый крутой
ты крутой
video-10 lyric-7 instrumental-10
Um som novo de Rock! Que fodaaa! Gratidão! O Rock respira.
Uhm...how does Anthony Kiedis look a little like a dictator from around 1939 and sound like Jethro Tull...this is so weird.
Se eriza la piel y esa guitarra John 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖
this one sound like from "californication"
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love the solo 🤘🤘🤘
This album is a masterpiece! RHCP forever!✊🏼❤
Legends!
Outstanding shipmates. Press on. USS Kitty Hawk CV -63 Jan 1980 to July 1983. My Neise is on the cover of you album The getaway.
Anthony's neck looks old!
I love this song, it matches with whats going on right now. Im waiting too.
Pretentious liberal sellouts.   Kiedis just begging to join Bono, Grohl and Vedder at the WEF table.
Always loved the Chili Peppers. Holding it down for Rock! Check this out, you might dig it. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=GQr5-R1iwrQ&feature=share
💙💙💙
Welcome Back Jonh, Flea, The best Bass player in the World <3 <3
A Great shanty
Great
Thank You for this Album. Nailed it.
Love the Peppers and this song. since the song came out I’ve been hearing 50 times a day at least replay after replay. Beautiful song about our last 3 years suffering for shenanigans and propaganda.
hát ez kurva jó!
Way to rewrite “Californication”… 👎
amazing
Peut être pas leur meilleur clip... mais sûrement une de leur meilleure chanson 😎
Absolute Gold!
Will Ferrell killin it on the drums.
Me mola bastante mucho, no digo mas, saludos.
live forever, red hot!!!!! ❤️‍🔥
cant stop listening to this song man.. quintessential chilis

Is futur esprit ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Listening to this song, I noticed it kinda sounds like COSMO CANYON from FFVII OST a little bit
Aaalllriigghht 🤘🤘
Frusciante voltou com tudo, fazia tempo que um novo solo de guitarra não me contagiava assim.
Cara esse álbum é maravilhosa espero que no próximo ano o the red hot chili peppers ganhe no musica awards
Great
Hahaha 😂 Those dance moves Kiedis - Gotta love it!
HES FUCKIN BACK Y'ALL
Listen to this a lot at work. Really feels timeless in a way. Can't tell if it's from a week ago, or thirty years ago.
Beautiful 💕🐈
John frusciente come back and booomm🔥🔥
Terrrrrrry
It's not a bad  tune,  but it's just  a tune,  can't really connect with it, nor is it particularly memorable, sounds like they just cut alot of words  up, put them in a hat and pulled them out when it came to the lyrics.  Maybe I'm missing something?
Still absolutely unbelievable!
Someone watched way to much tiger King and went all in on the Joe exotic hair cut.
their are now get old hiks....
Peace exists even in chaos.
Why does Anthony Kiedis suddenly have a different accent?
Anthony's voice is so perfect,no matter when you read this.  I love them forever, forever
If California was a band.
Alan Rickman: "I see you managed to get your shirt off..."
Pure, timeless genius

Nice work!!!
Please lead us... We have none.. Dont fail us like the gov. Difference is i we have love  They don't. God bless rhcp
When a single song becomes a theatrical performance, when feelings grow out of a song, the vibrations lift you, when pure energy propels you forward, when you've found peace again...thank you Anthony , Flea , John and Chad , you're back one.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST VERY GOOD THIS I'LL TAKE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
Frusciante's guitar play is unmistakably recognisable.
I know why you here 1:52 😎
WHAT A COMEBACK
ROCK IS BACK!!!!
1.25x speed slaps so hard
That’s guitar solo 🎸 and you be like 👍
I cry as soon as I hear this song... my god how can we not resist so much beauty... a masterpiece of my favorite band

I love this song😊
Wow it's been like 30 years since I heard a guitar solo sing like that. Thank G*d John is back.
Classic RHCP.  Thank you for this.
Respect these artists. What a song
A volta do jhon frusciante
Keep up the good good work 😇
the only thing i'd change is that moustache lmao
Terrible.... Retire guys
Moustache !
Thruth is absolutely ANY song with Frusciante is better than ANY song without him and period. Cool song, cool lyrics but not in MY RHCP top ten
Bellissima ! Fantastici
Worlds tightest pants
wellcome back john frusciante.....

When I heard the first riff, my heart stopped. So, he shot up like a racehorse.  Dry mouth, open smile, tears.  It was like seeing someone who came from paradise to hug you and feel all the good you've ever felt.  I love you guys!!  Damn, how good to see you again!!
aulas
♥♥♥♥♥♥
Best thing they've done in 20 years.
É uma atmosfera melancólica. Eu tinha uma expectativa diferente do álbum. Foi 1 balde de água fria.
yea!! AT LAST!!!
archer on the run - ok go for skyrim
Thank You!
Loving the new album. Had to drive from NY to NC and back in a weekend recently and listened multiple times. Solo in this song is awesome 😎
Great song!! Jethro Tull vibe... Sans flute
https://youtube.com/shorts/aLQozgg4N1Y?feature=share  Cover
Damn, frusciante is just so great!
That guitar solo 👽
They are the BEST❤️😘
This sucks actually. I mean it's just a RHCP cover.
Johns journey has been so full circle,so glad to have you back JF
Unreal...good to hear a new bit by the peppers! Great tune boys, great tune....
Really miss good old day ……. Welcome back mr.John
thanks you did it again 🙌
How is that a 59 year old man!?
Good music 😎🇵🇪
Esse é o quarteto que a gente gosta de ver.
Still rocking hard! Classic RHCP!!
I remeber seeing the red hot chili peppers when i was a child..... they just came out , and i remember singing Give it away now 🤣 35 years later..... these guys are still making some of the best music i ever heard. I would be bold enough to say, clearly the Red Hot Chili Peppers are all time best top 3
regis tadeu não aprovou essa
Terrible song 🤤
the best formation
GREAT SONG
Just a word : WOW!
Don't get me wrong I love RHCP and John is a amazing guitar player but I think he could really shine somewhere else, also this whole album is trash, they should've just kept Josh if they was gonna let John down like this.
40 years on and you guys are still creating legendary rock classics on every album. Thank you for sharing your genius with the world :)
I knew when I first heard this song it would be the best in the album ❤️🔥
John 💜
He lowers mike too soon at 3:28.   Anyone else notice 😂
banger!!
Nonsense lyrics
Wtf is this song, so nice to hear
This man will have the same voice forever
New album sucks in my opinion. Nothing sticks...I grew up with BSSM and listened to Californication a million times. This is a major letdown for me. I love their edgier, funkier sound. Only Whatchu Thinking and The Heavy Wing resemble the RCHP I love a bit.
This is the RHCP i missed with John.
After 2 year of Covid, this is like medicine for my soul; reminds me 2000’s. Thanks RCHP :)
We love you back a gain 😍😍🥰🥰👌🤝
Chad - dad John - eldest brother Anthony and Flea - little brothers
#1 artist on Billboard 100, congrats guys ✳💛💛💛💛💛💛
Ahora, mirando el mar en Huanchaco, Trujillo, Perú con RHCP -🇵🇪🏄🏄🤘
Good song on a solid album. The new album isn't groundbreaking by any means, but it is good, classic RHCP. They did a damn good job considering they are pushing 60.
THE SACRED FOUR!!!! HERE AGAIN!!!! 😀😀😀😀🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Anthony’s “dancing” kills me 😂
Yesssssss!!! 👊
Stadium arcadium vibes ....so good
SUPER ALGA KATHAKSTAN !
Gays beards it's OK but a porn mustache  is guacatela. Fucking people.
Anthony  is so ripped for his age!! They look and sound so great
China is on the darkside of the moon and nobody stands alone behind the sun. It has also been a long time since i made a new friend
Fuzz, yeah!✌
Wow, this is great!!!

0:46 i love this part i don't even know why
Love love this !!! I liked Josh ,however John on guitar is a whole different thing. It is meant to be !!!
Current thing
Every time I hear John's guitar on this song I like it more and more💯🔥🔥
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So glad my tattoo won’t rub off this song is inanely amazing. Formed the year I was born. Such Blessingtons for My family. Loving the lead guitarist thanks you gents
Es hermosa <3 RHCP Fan por siempre! <3
I can't unsee Will Pharrell playing drums
I like RHCP a lot,since i was a teenager. All of them. But recently I’ve heard a story about Anthony Kiedis,about one of many visits of chilli peppers in my country, that gave him a nickname,actually,i see him with his nickname.Anthony “Talarico” Kiedis. Why??😂😂
red hot siempre  fueron una buena música  y d echo todas sus canciones son muy buenas
The sun burns brighter from RHCP music
膜拜！！红辣椒，YYDS！！！
Thank you John Frusciante to come back
Fruiscante came back as a blessing to the band and RHCP went full on classic mode and dropped this banger.
Cadê os brasileiros???
Is that Will Ferrell playing the drums?
I’m so happy that John is back. There’s something to be said about their sound meshing so well together when he’s back. “The kid” is talented, but musically, he competed with Flea’s lead bass (guitar) constantly, where John understands that Flea is effectively the lead guitar and John adds flourishes and complements the music. They just grew up playing music and fundamentally understand each other.   Basically, ya don’t butt-heads for the limelight when you’re the guitarist for Primus, for example. That’s Les’s spot.
che pezzo da paura...
el picado a mick jagger
im just heard this song the other day on the radio. i was wondering who it was. i was thinking RHCP but I thought tthey were retired. I thought it sounded like RHcP from the drum beat and guitar but the vocals in the slow part sounded kind of like an Irish folk song. I was wondering who this was thats why I came here.
My name is Veronica!!!! ❤👏 thank you RHCP!!! 🇦🇷
ya i think this song is a hit
you makes me happy chilis
Very good!
i must have played this over 400 times this week.
billboard hot 100 - rhcp unlimited love at no.1 after 16 years and stadium arcadium - when music is good people listen -
They still have it...
Awesome!
Love the light riff from John just after the beginning.
Abrazo amigo buena rola
The first time I heard the guitar solo, I was so happy to hear John Frusciante was back. His sound is unmistakable, he is so much a part of their soul.
Love you guys so much💖 and  your album is fantastic!! Cant' t stop listening😊
Thank you for keeping music alive
Por muy lejos mi Banda de rock favorita
Will Ferrell rocks it!
Wating for another black summer to end
THE LEGEND OF JOHN FRUSCIANTE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☮️☮️☮️☮️
Always be my favourite band
will ferrell on drums
Complete lack of originality or progression from the past , just watered down version of previous achievements. What a waste of time
They're back and sounding better than ever. It's like they've evolved so everyone can listen and enjoy. Not too heavy but just great songs. No disrespect to Klinghoffer but with Frusciante back they bounce off one another and that comes with years of playing  together. They're amazing and Yes .  I've seen so many concerts over 30 years but this is the one I've wanted. and yes I'll be there in Manchester 22nd June 2022.  Can't wait so looking forward to it. Would I of gone if frusciante hadn't gone back ??? No I doubt it. But yesssss he's back xx
Yoooooo they're back
He's still very fit and healthy
Eddie Guerrero Look, love it
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Pero que temón se mandaron los RHCP

Just going through the motions. From lyrics, to the beat, to the visuals. Solid meh.

Wow amazing song
God dammit they’re back. I never took stadium Arcadian outta my car player in college. 4 years. Never another album was played. I’m so happy to see this come full circle. Welcome back John….you were definitely missed my friend.
Música perfeita toca na alma 🌍
พริกแดงกลับมาแล้วน่ะน้องๆ🥰 #RHCP
Great song dude 👌
That hook is probably gonna run through my head as I deal with trials and tribulations this summer...  "Been a long time since I made a new friend, waiting on another black summer to end" 💪
I’m crying, fuck.
RHCP is the first rock band I fell in love with in when I was 12. Through them I felt like I discovered another world. I’m so thankful for their existence. Thank you guys!
This era would be perfect if Anthony got rid of that mustache!
John Frusciante 😍🇧🇷
The Red Hot are back!! Yeahh!!🤘🏻🤗
OMG man, that moustache!
Jesus the pitch correction
Fucking great
Kocham❤
Love that they're back. I'm going to see them I'm September!  But this video is lame 😆
I was waiting for John Frusciante to come back. The atmosphere of the old Red Hots is back. Congratulations, great album !!!!
Soul to squeez vibes
I would prefer if Tony’s moustache had longer handles
We can all agree that the Chili Peppers might had been Hillel's vision but John is the Chili Peppers....
ILY
Nope.
You know a song is great when it pulls you in the second it starts
Drummer kinda looks like Will Ferrell 😂
Молодцы мужики, что не бросаете творчество
Classic Chilli pepper sound awesome
Desde que eu era um pirralho sempre gostei dessa banda  top de maiiiiiiis.....🤟🤟🤟
RHCP will always be my fav band.
The visuals in this video are beautiful
This takes me back to their first album!
I'm happy and angry at John at the same time,  But all in all glad as fuck
Хлопці,ви неймовірні...дякую за підтримку України!Слава Україні!
Prediction: the "been a long time..." part of the hook will someday play in the background of a commercial
I love this band from child ,so many memories ! Keep up ❤
They are back, but they still need one more album to get to where they were 20 YEARS ago. The car is fixed but needs more drivning practice around The block, Feusciante is The mechanic
I wish the whole album was this good!
Eddie guerrero
meh
What’s will Ferrell doing in this video
slay
John's back!!!!!!! Thank you God!
Amazing
The best .
Finally... putting a fresh blanket on the bullshit being released lately...good to hear this 👍
July 29th 2022 at Levi Stadium I'll be first in line and I can't wait.  I won a pair of tickets over 104.1 the Hawk radio station from Stockton, Cali. I'm a 2 for Tuesday winner! Total luck! lol
I thought they covered Danzig
so many great songs on the new album. just red hot chili peppers. love it. can't wait for the tour.
The chorus sounds like Slow Cheetah
RHCP no words. just listen.
Crazy that people think this is good 🤣🤣🤣
Frusciante is back!!!! Killer solo- Flea in the pocket with Chad!!! Viva 90’s Rock!
grandeeeeeeeee
I love this fucking band
おかえりなさい。そしていってらっしゃいませ
What’s going on with the accent. This song is  terrible. I can’t believe this got released
Yes they do
Brilliant
frusciante is incredible
John F. Looks like the early 90s (Grunge), but sounds like late 60s (Hendrix) Kedis Looks like Danny Trejo, but sounds like Connor McGregor.
I’m afraid my friends that this kind of beautiful music is coming to an end.. no one has talent anymore it’s all computer generated..
🎸🎸🎸🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💯💯💯
Hey guys, new album is amazing, the magic is real and eternal❤️
Los amo!!!!!
They´re not dead! Feelin 90´ today. We´re still here ;)
ITS JOHN FRUSCIANTE FROM THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPEEEEEERS
been listening to this band since i was 7 years old. 21+ years later and they are still rockin! RHCP FOREVER!!!
my sad old ass remembers an early mtv interview when they predicted to be one of the greatest bands on earth, i laughed and bought all their records. please remember the coyote song, i was a fan from day one. true men dont kill coyotes.
RHCP особенная, неповторимая группа. Альбом на повторе, крутые песни. Всем спасибо!!!
Anthony looks like Eddie Guerreo now
My god it's great to have John fruscainte back.. he's is the one of best guitarists in the world and underrated is an understatement. Welcome home john. I love this tune.. typical chilli's..it takes 2 or 3 listens and it's stuck in ur Head..I have no ideas what the lyrics actually mean but it's the chilli's so par for the course.. classic lines from other RHCP songs like can I smell ur dopamine, can I pet wolverine or I don't want to take it up with little Joe.. who's little Joe??
Adam from Killswitch engage Reminds me of flea. There both legends
Excellent song. Really sounds like a RHCP evolved
Oh god this is briliant
You could never go wrong with the Chili Peppers,listening to their music always gets me in a good mood.
RHCP having fun with new zoom backgrounds
fcuk yeah
For you who like this song you should be grateful because this song not for our generation this song for new generation..
Found this one since the album came out, and when my wife and kid goes to sleep I blast it on my earpods a dozen times every evening. Great, great album, so refreshing. All four guys nailing it together again.
Missing Klinghoffer
I understand that John Frusciante does not intend to grow old.
It's the fact they sound the same as they did 30 years is what's so fucking incredible. All hail Frusciante
Almost 40 years and the still got it!!!
La mejor canción que eh escuchado en este año
I could cry. Last year really was the blackest darkest summer ever and I am so happy it ended!!!! Wonderful art.   It’s like these songs are simultaneously about each one of us as much as they are about nothing.   A true sonic painting.
That sounds as good as always great to see still making great timeless  music
Love this song
New tool music, rhcp and meshuggah these are amazing times to be living in
Chinas on the dark side of the moon. Bet you guys missed that one 🖤
Sempre os meus favoritos RHC.
Best on off new album. Love the track
Huge music! Congratulations guys!
Good song,  even better tashe 🤙
@rhcpYTAdmin Please don’t turn off the comments on the music videos. The comment section is relatable or at the very least,  insight to another’s perspective.    The comments keep us engaged — meaning they increase the probability the audience will stick around ‘till the end of the YT video.
Damn! I feel like I’m in the backseat of my moms car in the late 1990’s listening to these guys again. To me only Red Hot Chili Peppers and Breaking Benjamin can teleport me back in time with their music.
he needs to shave that porno mustache😂
Anthony’s voice in this song throws me off compared to the other rhcp songs
С возвращением Джон, с тобой звук совсем другой
diego godin
Been a fan since the Agassi/Nike commercial. Love you guys...welcome back Mr Fru...you look great. Thank you so much for this beautiful music 🎶.
Californication all over again.
Maravilloso🪐🌠
This will be the song of the year!
I cant even think of words to describe how great that song is.
Anthony Kiedis is giving me some major buffcorrell vibes with his look and dancing in this video. Especially with that flex. This is not meant to be an insult to anyone.
They never disappoint
"China's on the dark side of the moon" China: how did they know?!?!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The LOVE for the Chilis never gets old.  Best song of the album 100% and seeing John back is just too much!!  :)) Budapest is waiting for you guys
Wow. Love it. 😁
johns back the trifecta is complete music is good again
I want to be ninja
why is Will Ferrell playing the Drums... 😂
Bring back Josh
Finally they use clothes 🤣
“Yarrr! Ships ahoy matey”.  Anthony Kiedis when he sing this
una bestialidad este tema
They are underrated, I’m that guy
It's a boring composition but well played and mixed, save for Kiedis' performance, which needed a lot of processing
The first thing I hear is heavy pitch correction on the voice, shame! :(
There's alot of similarities between this song and Big Sugar's "all hell for a basement"...not to mention Kiedis sounds like he's singing a sea shanty
Welcome back John
💙💙💙💙💙
anthony keidis out here looking like ben kingsley
🌶🏄🎺🏍🎸😻
Malísimo. Si fuese un grupo desconocido diríais que es una mierda.
johnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn frusciante
John's back and boy does it show
John Frusciante lo hizo de nuevo, regresa a la banda y graba un hit mas para la posteridad...
Eles estão de volta yeahhhhhhh!
Frusciante comes back and drops the best solo of his career on the very first track of the first good peppers album in 16 years.
Me to my wife: These lyrics make absolutely no sense! Think the guy was high  when he wrote them My wife: No you dumb@ss! ITS A SONG ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE!!  Flabergasted Silence
Anthony KungFu Kiedis
whu is the guy  on thge drums
Ah... real music
Now they are grandpas.
the Best for eternity
LOVE the verse, but expected another chorus.
As he grows older he resembles his dad even more.
Took me back to 2001 junior high days , Glad they came out with this would be an understatement 😁👌
❤️❤️❤️
Good Party last Night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LV06qFtCD4
Never rated them earlier but yep. They have proved to be a band of the ages
I have an addiction to this song
Love this song,has a nice dark melodic nature with great lyric and like others have said, very nice Hendrix's style playing and fills...they still got it
Amazing album. Much love.
Beautifully beautiful
Perfect
meh/10
The signature Fender is back!!!!
La cara de satisfacción de Anthony en la última imagen del videoclip lo describe todo
Absurdo!
When you write and play music like this you get into the rock and roll hall of fame.
Alguém aiii pode ou consegue falar para os organizadores do Rock Rio , para trazer eles pra tocar Dinovo no Rock Rio 2022 ? 🌻🖤
Sou grato, ver escutar, sentir a energia do Rock que fica para sempre 🌻 🖤
It takes me right back to the way I've always remembered them to be. Simply perfect.
Ok, I'm the only one who's going to say it - Anthony looks at least 10 years older then he really is ever since he adopted that child molester look. He went from a long haired sex symbol to a mullet wearing sex offender. I wonder if he bought a white cargo van to really complete the look? God I hope it's just a look......
Support RHCP and buy their album!
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
RHCP with Frusciante and Rick Rubin can’t be beat. Sounds fucking amazing.
I’ll never get used to this Alfalfa Hitler look that Anthony is going for.
JOHHHNN IS BAAAAACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD IS REAL
this, this right here, is really good shit:)
Does anyone else not like this at all? I came here cause I thought they’d be good but this isn’t at all. I respect other people’s opinion I’m just wondering if anyone has the same one as me
Dudes 59 and killing it. Great track.
China is on the dark side of the moon
good black sommer lml
When you want the old thing back and it returns sooooo good!!!🥰
I think covid reset all of us. Especially the RHCPs
Since 90s they should be called *THE LUKE WARM CHILI PEPPERS* - anyone remember Mothers Milk? Now that was the album...  Remember when they played funk and Flea was the bass slap master...?
With fruscinante is other flavour! RHSP is One of the best banda in the world
I love this 'grandfathers of rock' his music creativity never ends  ;)
Listened to the album was very excited this morning!!! Played every track and skipped everyone 3/4 of the way through, was terrible, not one catchy song on the whole album, so what I did was listen to there last album and it was loadsssss better, seems like this album is just a mess, where are the guitar licks? The catchy chorus’s? The melodies? I think I heard a a couple of decent guitar solos from John but other than that it was crap, I feel sorry for Josh, I think all of johns best work was on californiacation, BTW and stadium Arcadium don’t think he anything left in the locker, I wish they could just get rid of this album and try again
I like how he sings China is on the dark side of the moon in a pirate voice
Finaly the puzzel bites fit again!!!!
Pra mim a melhor do álbum
Banging love this!!!
Nice one, 20 years ago this would be a big hit, but those days are long gone...I still love it.
One of the most constant things in my life has been this band. And thank goodness
❤️❤️❤️
After a long time,the legend is back🖤
This song really grew on me. Didn't like it much at first, but now it's one of the better ones from UL imo
~♡
Welcome back John, we missed you.
Il solo sentir suonare di nuovo la chitarra di John...vale "il biglietto". Ben tornato John..ben ritrovati RHCP!!! 🎸❤
good vibes!
My last favorite song before the war. After first russian missiles falls on my home city i cant listened to any music for a month. And its only few days I've started again with that song. Let it be a good signal. There is a summer soon after all...
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
no mames, john se parece a keanu reeves
Excellent🌶 🧲 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbmIwZHYTlg
Just Beautiful.
🇬🇹
Puf q vibes de redhot tiene este TREMENDO TEMAZ0000! Para mí el favorito del álbum 😍
Got back John Frusciante but lost Taylor Hawkins.  The 2020's are just fucked up yo.
Wow this takes me back to the 90s, I love it.
Wooooooooooow !!!!!! Fucking cool song, colorfull, powerfull .... thank you guys !! :-) Hi from Czech republic
I have to admit, I don't like the album, but this track is truly special and I love it.
love u so much
Esses caras sempre estarão a milênios a frente!!! Será sempre a minha banda favorita!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I feel old and young at the same time listening to this song
3:23 As a drummer I hate seeing when the drums in the music video don't match the recording. A pet peeve of mine I guess...
Klasse Song
Wow, bands like RHCP are getting back on the map due to popular demand! Good job boys! 🥁🥁🥁
Ok, it's RHCP... and thier funkiness..funkiest... now I want the video for watchu thinking. Best song in this album imo
I've been waiting too. Come on over to our up north campsite and perhaps we will figure things out together Mister.
Damn how I've missed John on guitar. You guys have saved my life with your music. I'm forever grateful for all of you.
Heard it at the gym so I had to check it out.
red hot energy kicking off everything
The best to ever do it. RHCP has been my soundtrack for the past 24 years. I love you all 💙 never stop the music
They are back! Great fookin tune
I have a feeling this is the start of something you?
So glad John is back and will Ferrell  is running drums.
Some wake and bake action right here 🤤
♥️
I can hear jimi hendrix. Amazing
these songs have literally been a therapy for me. I was upset that I didn't grew in a time when these guys were at their best. I recently started playing bass like a year before they started releasing songs. I feel like this is their comeback for my generation of musicians who don't get used to the modern music that people make in order to make money. I have been through stressing times recently and just got in college. Thank you RHCP, WE LOVE YOU!!
Sorry but I hate this song and his voice in this song, why is he singing like that? Like he's on the verge of singing swedish folklore
Nope...not a fan.
Thanks God finally they comeback
Lol 1:30 Anthony takes his shirt off... felt like an eternity
Excelente!!!!
Thank you!
Embarrassingly dull.
When the scene starts I'm like WTF...then when the light fades in I think "of course he's wearing a bath robe, because RHCP"
Do you like ketchup on Fries
Amo cada una de sus canciones,los llevo en el corazón ❤
The Rolling Stones of their generation. Some bands never go away.
İm 8 years old but i love it thank you this makes me hapier
Incluso con sus casi 4min la sentí cortita :(
awesome!
Wow
John is the wizard of the band and they are magical...the world need music like this!!!
still poetic
Anthony ruins the whole album for me. What a shame. Ghost writer would do wonders for them and I was so excited when I heard John is coming back...
Got better 100% after the left of Josh. Incredible!
I needed this so much! I actually have tears... RHCP so amazing! THIS IS EVERYTHING!
I wonder if Gadinski has heard the tracks yet
They never change 😍😂
" AND. NO-ONE STANDS ALONE BEHIND THE SUN.."  INTERESTING words to me/MY god
John Welcome Home
Love the sound!..
HELL FUCKING YES!!
great respect Red Hot Chilli Peppers💪💪💪💪
Yep. its chili time.
Yaaaaaawwwn..........boring ass elevator music, they really suck.
The best forever
They sound even older than they look
I love this band and I did a backing track for you guys so you can practice the solo : https://youtu.be/x_nLw4Wz-yQ   One of my favorite band of all times, good job guys it reminds me your old tracks that I love so much !!
Absolute masterpiece please come back to New Zealand !!!!
Please come back to the desert 🏜️ headliner we need this!
Such a poor choice for their single. “Here ever after,” is way better. Don’t know how they missed that.
Thank the lord, the chillis are back!!
The Phoenix will rise 🔥🥷🏻
they have never left

Absolutely amazing
até quando não é RHCP em alta qualidade, ainda é bom
0:45 favorite
Can RHCP and Lana Del Rey collab? That would be my dream
I like the song, not sure about the look Anthony has going on though lol
0 % girls  0 % cars  100 % pure music 💪
so... about that guy John Frusciante....
They crushed it. Thank you RHCP
You guys know you can let John extend out those solos.  Gilmoure didn’t stop after the first phrase came back around. He took it to another spot.
Just a great Freakin Band man...Kick Back, let them do the rest..
歌一出来前几秒我就知道是rhcp了 风格太独特太鲜明了
I can feel the love
Will ferrel has a band?
Amazing!!
I wish Anthiny went back to the way he was in the early 90s like when he looked  in pount break
Anthony gonna be on the next season of Reno 911 😁👍
This new album is pure sh** I miss Josh and direction RED HOT were going.  New album sounds sooooo tired 😫 😩 😴
Whenever I hear this song in future, I will remember the war in Ukraine. The sadness as we confront a new/old reality in the world just fits the song perfectly, although of course the lyrics are about other things.
Wirklich Großartiger Titel !!!!!
red hot com Frusciante é red hot
Sorry......The RHCP are  in musical  marasme !!!!.......dead in 90's
Real music lives on.
This sounds like it was written in 5 min. That or some jam you'd hear your local high school perform at a talent show. Just sounds like easy commercial money for RHCP. Y'all eat up anything these days.
Visit Nepal plz ❤️❤️🙏🙏
The guitar tone in solo is AMAZNIG
Queremos rock
4 experts: Guitar, drums, bass, and staying in shape after 50.
Están haciendo mera música pa viejos 🤪
Música Top, Red hot Nunca Decepciona, Melhor banda de Rock do Mundo.!    ❤🇧🇷#WeOfBrasilLoveYouRHCP🇧🇷❤
Legend. Looking good always good ❤
Listening with right hand side wire only cause I dont have the lleft one my cat cut it love it ❤
Ahí están mis peppers
When I first heard this on the radio (I usually listen to an alternative music station), I thought this was one of their older tracks.  It took me a few listens and some googling to realize this was a new track.  Way to go, guys…RHCP is one of those bands who always seem to make their music sound timeless.  (And this is just me, but I kind of want to see this song cross over to pop/Top 40 radio.)
Great new song ! Thx, Chili Peppers :)
I was think song like john style wouldn''t back again but they're back this is definitely john style and I'm Fucking Love it. Thanks  for the comeback guys. I'm waiting for live show in Indonesia.
rock n roll !!!!!
Masterpiece
Getting some mad Joe Exotic vibes
Love the song and yeah they haven't lost their sound but when I watch this video I just think.  To you, to me People in the UK will get it. With the tash n mullet he looks like one of the chuckle brothers. Ooh not a good look.
the only number on the album that is good, but it is a classic Red hot chili Peppers number 👍❤️
0:56 californication 🥁 beat Wow!
The real RHCP! Welcome back John, glad you are all rocking together again. Life is too short.
Gold welcome back
🎸RHCP 🎸
You deleted this song from apple music…. Why…
Frusciante over here looking like Keanu
Es increíble que en pleno 2022 sigan haciendo música y sonando tan frescos , experimentando con cosas nuevas pero sin perder su esencia es digno de admirar que sigan vigentes por tantos años sin bajar la calidad. Simplemente unos ídolos.
✨✨✨👍🏻👼✨😻
Thank you Anthony, Flea, Chad and John. My universe is in order again.
Dónde están los latinos que amamos el buen rock de estos genios. Increíble que en el 2022 suenen tan frescos con ese sonido que los caracteriza.
Was hoping for better with john he plays well it sounds good but the songs seem overdone..
Enfin les red hot les vrais !!! 💞💞💞💞
Pinchi segundito de silencio pa que luego entre el coro de madraso >:(
ANd todays greats are a british guy who dresses up in his mums clothes...Hairy Styles.  SNowflake generation begets..NO talent
Having spent the last five years getting up to speed with RHCP, such gains.  Deep emotional releases, heavy cries, and, yes, a need to break loose.  Such a boost. Anthony, Flea, Chad, John, and, yes, Josh,  thanks so much.  Congratulations on Unlimited Love and all  the best.
A lazy rain am I 퍽 게으르다 비가, 그렇지?

acho que não tem nenhuma musica que eu não goste deles amo todas <3
I'm so glad we get to see Will Ferrell back on the drums.
Omg I have goosebumps! Connecting to something higher than yourself when you fee that from a song.  John Frusciante is absolutely amazing.
Thank God John is back
Classic chili sound, love it
It's the RHCP I've known all my life
Espero ver su estrella 🌟 en el paseo de la fama felicitaciones Saludo de Venezuela.
Man, Chad Smith just swings. Such wonderful music.
1:52
still hot Anthony
🌲🌄🙂 🌘🥸☀🙃🌶⛵🔇🖤🌞
2:49 holy shit that transition
The problem with RHCP has always been Anthony Kiedis. He makes every song sound the same, his lyrics are awful. The band can actually play, but he runs every song.
Where did Keidis's brogue come from????
Top D+
Omar Rodriguez has left a mark Johhny and it's beautiful
Why is he singing in that weird ass accent? cringe af
I thought maybe the guys broke up. No new music for six years. Can’t complain since they were making music in the 90s. Means they have spanned more than three decades, which is excellent. Makes me not feel as old.
viciada nesse som...
Not really a RHCP fan....until now. Wow.
que linda musicaa llegue a llorar con esta musica  gracias por estos exitos
super banda, ouvindo desde a adolescencia
Esse vídeo é quase um asmr.🤭
One of their best songs tbh
Nice to see you guys still doing it and putting out great music. Omg been to many of shows back at SUNY Albany 89, catch almost every show they come around. John is the glue !!
Self-indulgent tripe, give me the angry Chili Peppers from the 90s any day.
im far away from home now, and listen to this amazing and surprising music again today, feels like im back home at the moment. thanks
When did Ben Stiller join RHCP?    hahaha, Joking. Good work fellas, youve always rocked!!!!!
La rola que marcó el regreso de John, ese solo está loquísimo, bueno, el álbum en general está loquísimo, hecho con tanto amor 🤟🤟🖤🖤
Say what You want but when Anthony was a heart, Chad was a muscle and Flea was a crazy mind of that band, then John was always an unquestionable SOUL of it.
I wiating you so
Add this to the stack of jams....5/5 dudes
I am 14, I am grew with this music, I love red hot
Enfin .....Vous revoilà ❣
What happened on Epstein island??
Does Kiedis have an inferiority complex? Always needs to show his body or show that he's "strong" lol, sit down oldass
Beautiful!
This is all I wanted from them!  Just, being back ya know.
WHAT ANOTER MASTERPIECE!
I cant believe people were predicting this album to fail. So many great songs to come out of this album, including Black Summer Here Ever After Aquatic Mouth Dance Not the One Poster Child The Great Apes It's Only Natural She's a Lover These Are the Ways Whatchu Thinkin' Bastards of Light White Braids & Pillow Chair One Way Traffic Veronica Let 'em Cry The Heavy Wing Tangelo
Ouvi todas as novas músicas e essa me parece a "menos pior"... Red Hot morreu, infelizmente...eu como fã da banda, fico triste com isso
What an awesome groove!  Hoping to see them in Michigan.
OMG this album is so flat what happened to the golden four, voices melodies are very very flat, Flea and Frusciante are so shy....no song upon 4/10, every album have at least one masterpiece and several amazing song, sex sugar for example, even if Californicztion by the way stadium arcadium were perfect to the beginning until the end ...
finally 😍
26M ???   Se esta extinguiendo la gente con cultura
I can't believe there's no jojo fan here
What a great fucking song
Amazing!!!❤️ Frusciante was born to RHCP. Feels like Californication era.
Show essa já é a clássica RHCP amo!
This song along with These Are The Ways and Here Ever After are no doubt the three best songs on the album.
❤️❤️❤️👏👏👍😃
I have fallen head over heels in love with the rhcp
good to see you old friend
Seriously who the fuck is writing their lyrics this time around, absolutely terrible..Chad and Flea always good, guitar solid...lyrics meaningless shit
wow john wick's playing guitar
Vai ser um dos hits:Hot  YouTube: melhores músicas de 2022.
Beautiful.. ❤️
I was blessed to help with their UK fan club in the 1990s they are complete class, stayed in Rockford, stood stage side at wembley and Reading, this album is really moving for many reasons, they still wear their hearts on their sleeves, slink that funky rockinfreak with ease, magic blood sex sugar sweet and totally elite! I ended up living in LA because of my connection to this city through the peppers, miss you HH! You'd be so proud, amazing band of funky monks, fleas the kindest sweetest soul & John too... Welcome back to the kit Kat spaceland mothersbip everyone! Bloody fantastic 🌈🌟❤️💛💗💚💜🧡💙
To the person who is reading this... I probably don’t know you, but judging by your choice of music, we would be great friends.
Loving the new album, cant wait for the UK tour RHCP ❤️🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Is it just me or Anthony looks like BoJack here? 😅
中学生の時に初めてレッチリのファーストアルバム聞いてから28才になった今でもつかず離れずな感じでずっと聴き続けてる。 ジョンがバンド離れてからはレッチリから離れて、自分にとって未開のジャンルやアーティストを聴いてたけど、復帰の話が話題になってからStadium Arcadium とか昔のアルバムを押入れから引っ張り出して聞き直してた。 それで分かったことは自分が一番好きなバンドはやっぱりレッチリだということ。 PVでジョンの顔が見えた瞬間に泣いてた自分がいた。久しぶりに純粋に幸せを感じた瞬間だった。
Disco Foda!! Surpreendeu - Se ouve 1 vez e dá vontade de tocar na íntegra mais vezes. 🚬
Me encanta porque la canción es genuinamente buena, me recuerda a los viejos tiempos pero sin apelar a la nostalgia barata. Tiene ese toque nuevo que la hace distinta. Sin duda es y se siente como un nuevo hit de los Red Hot <3
Its gotten old. 👎
Ein gutes Beispiel dafür, wenn das Ergebnis größer ist, als die Summe der einzelnen Teile -  so wie Supertramp nicht ohne Roger Hodgson funktioniert, so wenig funktionieren die RHCPs ohne John Frusciante - den Sound der Alben "Bye The Way" und "Stadium Arcadium" mochte ich eh sehr.
AK is 59 wtf !
I think they lost their drive and trying to replicate themselves. I was a big fan of them but each of their album is unique and it looks like their songs are written and composed by someone else but not them, and this issue makes me feel bad about them.
From my pov their
Fuck , this is a good song ! ,  Holy shit what a masterpiece .. and that guitar solo ,wow !
People always complain bands don't play like they used to, RHCP goes back and improves it.
This song is much better when I imagine it being sung by 1991 Anthony Keidis.
Yeah I get it, soon as people wake up from this black summer we can ascend to the 4th dimension, bringing back 90s nostalgia is a fine start.🤟🤟
I BEEN WAITING… I BEEN WAITIIING…  WAITING ON JOHN TO COME BACK TO THE BAND
OMG, this song is sheer CRAP! Never liked them, and this just even more that i am NOT into them, nor will ever be.

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
3:08 Best part.. 🔥🔥🔥
vikings vibes
goooood
RHCP é vida!!!
офигеннная песня
QUE PERFEIÇÃO
look! just I know their song Californication! these guys are still super team
Una certezza.......
good to see will ferrell is still drumming
Ouvirei as outras músicas do álbum, mas tenho certeza que Black Summer é a melhor. Que música perfeita, mano. Colocaria fácil ela nos icônicos Californication e By the Way!❤
Rede Hot Chili Peppers sempre arrebentando!
but why you think you are above all...you are  just  band with lot of inside problems..,  Fruciante is back...do you thinK you  are back in  business now when you have fired  Klinhoffer ?   c
this song definitely has some 'Californication' vibe. Love it!
Does that mean it's summertime and  people are burning the city down
I really enjoy how they write and play these new songs.  Not too punk. Not too crazy but something you can sin up along and dance  to . Loving their new. Stuff x
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Thank you for keeping it simple, pure and just great music!!!
Esse estilo é  único.O que faz a banda  destruir  nas músicas 🎶
Very beautiful song 🎵
I met the band when I was 12, today I'm 19 and it's still my favorite band. I grew up with these guys' amazing songs
The best song 🎸🎶
incrível, cadê os br
Перцы 🌶 вы лучшие!!!!💪🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻💥
Que maravilla este grupo. Mis favoritos desde los 12 años. Love the way they make me feel
Great, a new oldschool album. Very happy about this. I love their old style. Brings back memories.
ДАААААААААААаааа!!!!!!
GOAT
Bravo
OMG This is SO F*****G GOOD!!!!!!!!! They're all bringin their A -GAME here. John is OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!!!!!
Dude Seeing a solo like this these times 🔥
I’ve read a lot of comments paraphrasing roughly: “Black Summer wasn’t great, but the rest of the album will be amazing.” Well… in my opinion, Black Summer is unfortunately this album’s best track (I don't share the same opinion of those comments, I think Black Summer is good). I’m sad that overall, this album was a big letdown for me…
My love for john is infinite...
💝 👌 💯
Literally just found out they're back and their sound hasn't changed too much. my inner child is so happy 😊
01:51 Solo Gold!
❤
Amazing guitar and the flea poncho awesome VIVA MÉXICO!!
Thank You guys we really need this !!!!!
His Hendrix-like guitar phrasing was sorely missed! Can't wait to hear this live!
I like song Red hot chili pepers
very amazing welcome back guys.
Nossa, como anthonie kieds envelheceu. Mas continua foda
This might be my new favourite Chili Peppers song.
temon tras temon grandes se pasan
Just fkn awsome makes me want to boogie love it funny lyrics too  Hot guys nice harmonies
It’s amazing Anthony can have such a horrible hair style yet be so famous
This is type of music that needs to be back as an option. Music is great influence and most stuff of radio is materialistic garbage promoting consumerism by design.
Frusciante's back :D
Welcome back John ❤️
This song is a Time Machine. Happy me 🙏🏼❤️  You are back 🙌🏼✨🙌🏼
😍😍😍😍🤘
Maybe i'm a beggar - Supertramp (1970)
Esse álbum novo tá bom demais!!!👏🏿🎶🎧
I was kinda enjoying the new album until I read that Anthony Kiedis is a self-confessed child-rapist. I literally didn't know about this until yesterday. The music tastes sour after learning this.
THANKS GUYS! This world needs MORE ROCK AND ROLL!! PLEASE!!!!!! HELL YEA!!!!!!
Beautiful and emotional song for me. I feel like I'm flying. Only RHCP have this energy!
This is soo good
Love it!!!
Is it crazy to say that this is RHCP's best song since the mid-90's?  The CHORUS....man oh man.
The Unlimited Love is not available in Russia. Thanks to politics that music is not available to people who are outside of it! Peace!
So happy the album is out now
i love this song so much 🎵🎵 feeling the rhcp like before
This is a masterpiece.☮️Just what the world needs right now... is Emotional music straight from the soul. Thank you for your healing tunes.
Horrible!
Amo a evolução de vocês foda
Tá agradeço Deus, pois colocou, homens certos, na hora certa, amém 🙌
_ol
Been a long long time
Could Flea go PLEASE back to Modulus bass😬?
This about the black summer fires?
I love these guys and maybe its the first song heard but its eh....at best. Been a fan since the first album so ....i dont know.
God bless these angels
SUDAMERICA POR FAVOR
São Bernardo  A B C lucaõ salve nação
Parabéns banda du caraeee bom demais esses monstros
muito foda
They remain the only band from the 90’s and 00’s I grew up loving, which I still buy every new album from.   All those other bands from those decades I lost interest in or they lost their magic.    RHCP has still got it, and with John back it’s just that extra dimension of chemistry.   Everything about his playing is just so perfect for what they do.
I want to die while this song is in the background
Por favor, un concierto en México.
Como eu sonhei com essa volta 😢😢😢 amo vcs meus eternos meninos ❤️🥰😍
When is he going to change his hair and shave his mustache?
Takin me back... Wow, not a damn thing changed! I was in 9th grade when they were real popular.. 🔥🔥🔥
Achei que esse novo álbum faltou mais música como Black Summer, mas no geral ótimo álbum.
I don't get it
If it's not psychic spies from China then they're on the moon! What will China do next?...Wait...
🖤🖤🖤🤟🤟🤟
Kiedis voice is bad, he cant sing and his voice is souless and showing his age now. They they should just ditch Kiedis and have Frusciante sing.
I maiight be on the daaark saiiyed of the moon, but this song sucks.
Buen sonido.. otra cosa con John de vuelta..
Now that the album is out, it's clear this is the best song on there.
That man is almost 60 and in better shape than me at 19 waw. Great song
Zero.
Switzerland 🇨🇭 have allways Black summer, kkkkk
This tune is brilliant
It’s like they never left!!!
Wow, didn't know Keanu and Will Ferrell were in a band.
Jhon is *ucking amazing in the guitar !
great
i love youuuuu
I heard this on the Radio the other day, not knowing John was back, I listened and instantly knew it was him. Not just from the gorgeous guitar, that’s a given, but the whole band just sounded like them…I could hear their souls in unison through their music. Truely another level.
IN ONE EAR, OUT THE OTHER= TIME TO RETIRE
Is that Keanu Reeves on guitar 🎸?
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
This song slaps. Immediately like it, which is rare with a new tune. Usually takes repetition.
Wow!!!!
The little lick from Flea right at the beginning is just SPOT ON and made me go "HOLY SHIT" along with John's guitar. YESSSSS HE'S BACK BABY!
Anthony Keidis is so cringy, man. But I appreciate they're putting out some positive stuff in a time where everyone feels in the dark.
I can’t believe these guys are still putting out top-notch music!
The drum beat sounds like the one from californication…and still I like it…
You are the Best!
Well, this sounds great! Guess it's the bad place for me!
This song is a real banger. Quintessential RHCP.
Chad looks like Will Ferrell hehehe
why he flexin so much though
I like to think black summer means BLM protests
Fruisch is one of the great heavies in the beat guitar solo field
Red hot chili Peppers ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wenn john spielt, geht mein herz auf🤩💙
Who's this band? Seems a nice little group. Could go far.
This sh!t is f*ckin' excellent, fellas. Damn!
I will put this up there with Blood Sugar Sex Magic
Back to my innocence years' sounds..back to '90..love this
Legendary !
This summer will be hoot!
the timing of this song and whats happening in Ukraine-this song just lines up with that too close. I swear this song is exactly about everything in Ukraine. but i have to get ready for work and do not have the time to explain anymore-just listen to it while thinking about this war.
Not really liking the new album… this is the only song that John even shines through :( well here’s to hoping the next one is better!
Love it!
WOWWW JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK.....👍👍👍👍
Finally, some great quality music. The radio gotten so bland. We missed you guys, this comeback is gonna be triumphant !!!
Danzig did it better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kREle_uGckw
Put4 que rolón
Lyrics are meaningless but the song is still awesome!
Black Summer é a melhor, o álbum ficou incrível! Black Summer is the best, the album turned out amazing!🇧🇷🌶️❤️
Instant classic
When you think it can't get any better
Anthony Kiedis celebrates Leif Erikson day
The video is as bad as the song which is almost as bad as the Kiedis moustache.
Bristol pirate
Tiger king called, he wants his hair back
Tony s torso never gets old
Minuto 2:22  desafina john
holy funk balls. BSSM reloaded. this is why this is the best band, ever. #unlimitedlove
I really love the audio mix style.. it's a refreshed yet still faithful to the old signature.. RHCP still kick asses 20 years later... RHCP FOREVER
I've been listening to RHCP my whole life, my dad had been a fan for a long time, so this is the music I grew up listening to. I have never stopped following them, I love them. Keep rocking. (Also, those are some damn ripped 50 year olds, goddamn)
1:52 acid drop DMT flashbacks 🌌
Русские на месте???
Just listened to all the new songs and this is still my fav. Most of them were underwhelming but its cool! I stan RHCP and have tons of bangers from them ive been listening to for 95% of my life and im 35 lol
Oh dear.
F
Please Rescind my previous Comment:  They all look pretty damn good considering. NO comparisons.
How is it that the rest of the band looks so aged.  But not John F who was a huge smack addict in the day? Huh?
It's about Ukraine
💣💗💗💗
Why not concert in Belgrade, its to far Budapest, I have a children no way to go, I want that whole my life, now I have 34 i listen RHCP since I am 11 year old, please come to Belgrade!
when they first released the little clip of the guitar for this song i thought it was gonna be great. this song is terrible. not a good song
Anthony does not look good
❤️
QUE COISA LINDA CARA [
john mi amor
🇲🇨
Yessss!
Wow justin long knows how to sing
This is like Around The World all over again.
THESE BOYS BRING A SMILE TO MY HEART
Just a few more hours. Full Unlimited Love ♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥
Excellent song
Los de la vieja escuela sabemos lo que representa Jhon Frusciante en la banda. El es único... Sin desmeritar lo de johs en su paso por la banda.
I can dig it!
John Frucisnate is back, baby. Avril Lavigne back to punk root, Simple Plan making a song with Deryck Whibley. 2022 is 2004 again
I don't like the song but red hot Chili Peppers have the best rock songs I can Imagine.
Loved the " get it on" sneaky.... there is no room for criticism here.
spectacular
Experimental multi media art project "amalgamation face".  Check out channel for more details.
joe exotic that you?
0:46 I could listen to that riff till the end of times, that shit healed my soul
W FRUSCIANTE!!!!
Jhon is back !!🤟🤟
El parante de microfono se movia solo por todos lados
i love red hot chili peppers
This song get me peace here in The Brazil 🙏🏾
Vibe🌴
Now I need the MV for The Heavy Wing!!!
Ta parecendo o senhor madruga
I’m sure everyone hears Hendrix in Fruciante’s playing. Love it! Can’t wait to hear what else is the come!
A band that has been releasing one shit album after another for 27 years. Their last good album is One Hot Minute from 1995. God have mercy.
Thank you RHCP 😍😍
gg bro
Wow 😍
thank you guys for this return, the old school!!!!
Congrats to the band for the Hollywood Walk of Fame! ❤️
This band represents the Tom Brady of rock
Can’t wait for this tour!!! 😍👏🏼🙌🏼
<3
Backstreets back, but it's even better.
Anthony Kiedis has been taking his shirt off for 59 years and he still looks cool.  I took off my shirt a few years ago, but now when I take it off and look in the mirror I quickly put it back on
John Fucking Frusciante!  We missed you.
Oh my god, this is sooo bad!
Do you think he cuts his own hair, or pays someone so it looks like he does?
RHCP for life
👍
I been waitin...
Love this song ❤  Love from Italy 🇮🇹
This sounds like Californication and Wet sand had a beautiful son
Welcome back john 🖤🖤🖤🖤
I've been waiting
pues... nada especial, muy pop
BELLA...BELLA....BELLAAAAA. I Red Hot NON SI SMENTISCONO MAI. Come il vino...più invecchiano e migliorano. Rock never dieeeeeeeee.
This sounds like a RHCP song written by a computer - it's so generic RHCP and so forgettable.
Has the sound of Woodstock, circa 2022.
Was at a 'Denny's',  the other night....so cool to hear this song over the restraunt's speakers!!!  Total variety of a crowd in the place......people were loving it!!!!  Way Coool!
I didn't know Anthony Keidis was Irish?
02:16 parece que escucho algo a la distancia, espero no ser el único xd
Los solos de la guitarra suenan tan suave y agradable   Que siento que entran por mis poros cada nota que se toca   Y me hace sentir bien
I bought tickets to Nashville for over 600 dollars.... Now I don't regret it on bit. Born in 1981. By far the best music group!
I like to listen without watching. On all their stuff. John has such good taste with how he forms his links.....lol if anthony shaved that 70's porno stash...that would be nice
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Man literally looks mid 40s. But in reality… Timeless.
So happy John is BACK! 🤩💃
Another reminder of why I stopped listening to them. Kiedis can't sing and they've lost their intensity. Over produced and hollow sounding. So disappointed. I used to be such a huge fan. They haven't done anything good since Blood Sugar Sex Magik.
Work of art ❤
Red hot THE PHOENIX ALIVE never died.
Top top lyrics ,top song from a top band. Love from Liverpool
You guys all seem like later fans. This is NOTHING like their original sound. No funk, no attitude. The chillies are old and they sound it.
guess whos back
Z tekstowo.pl  Jestem leniwym deszczem  Niebiosa odmawiają płaczu  Kremacja uszczupla Twoje zapasy  Noc przebrana jest za południe  Marynarz przemówił zbyt wcześnie  A Chiny są po ciemnej stronie księżyca  (Usłysz mnie teraz)  Dziobaków jest tylko kilka  Sekretne życie Roo*  Postać, której nigdy nie znałem (Pogódź się z tym)  Mój krater waży tonę  Łucznik jest w odwrocie  A nikt nie jest sam za słońcem  Minęło dużo czasu odkąd zaprzyjaźniłem się z kimś nowym  Czekam aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato  Minęło dużo czasu, a Ty nigdy nie wiesz  Czekam aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato  Powstrzymaj płonący bicz  Żeglują po naszej cenzurze  Jazda na bezgłowym koniu, by podróżować  Minęło dużo czasu odkąd zaprzyjaźniłem się z kimś nowym  Czekam aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato  Minęło dużo czasu, a Ty nigdy nie wiesz  Czekam aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato  Czekałem, czekałem,  Czekałem aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato Czekałem, czekałem,  Czekałem aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato Czekałem, czekałem,  Czekałem aż skończy się kolejne czarne lato   * – Roo – „Maleństwo”, postać kangurka z Kubusia Puchatka  Tekst pochodzi z https://www.tekstowo.pl/piosenka,red_hot_chili_peppers,black_summer.html
John Frusciante has still got it ❤️
А ще заспівайте про те, як Росія напала на Україну!
That guitar solo gave me butterflies ❤️
well done Lads, its a good one
Я люблю эту группу и ваши песни, но как блокировка песен для нас поможет миру? Лишив нас музыки, вы сделали мир лучше?
Their best song of the past decade, if not longer.
hit
aight someone get me this straight he said china is on the darkside  of the moon?
Will Ferrel is quite great behind the drum. Don't you think?
Desde que se estrenó, vengo cada día <3
John Frusciante is God 🔥
2:50 this gave me nostalgia of the frickin 2003 slane castle concert
Anthony, ganti rabut gih, jelek banget lu
Frusciante de volta
Oceanic waves of LOVE for RHCP; it’s so many years of killer guitar, searing drum, pounding bass, a gun of a voice- always the same, yet always new!
Rhcp, you guys had me since under the bridge. You are such a big part of my life if you only knew. Yes,, thank you so much for being you and keeping it RHCP. God bless you all, and all your fans. The world is such a beautiful place because u all are in it. By tht i mean ban and fans alike.
Utter crap
Jimi Hendrix + RHCP = this song.
Is just me that thinks Jefferson airplane here?
Critics already telling that album lacks of energy and does not match with their other albums with John, the weakest one
VV B T ...viAspettiamoAnApoli
EAnkeQstAèFatta...laudOooOmyeiha...gnéoooohhhw
As someone who has heard the album, don't be fooled by these singles. While this is the best of the 3, they are definitely not the best of the album. Ya'll are in for an amazing surprise!
Need this new album allready
Love the tricked out sounding solo dancing around the melody ... classic RHCPs...
This riff could definitely be on their first or second album, so consistent its amazing.   👏
Son unos genios, cada canción es un éxito!!! los amo RHCP
band was  always trash
Solo from F that’s all what we need
I've missed John.
Masterpiece
This is the classic ChiliPeppers we love...with the deep dirty funk sound! They lost me completely after One Hot Minute... felt like it was only to gain popularity and air play. Sounded like a completely different band, it was just not what I loved about them, sounded soulless....this album, from the 3 songs I heard so far,  spunds like its bringing back their roots, in my opinion when they were at their best!!!
💖💖🤩🤩🤩🤩
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🤟
Loved there classic stuff but wasnt a big fan of their last few albums, however, this feels like a throwback to what I loved so much about them, looking forward to the album
John <3
So bad
John how I missed your licks man.
Been a fan since...well forever. But so far what I have heard sucks!
My favorite fu*king band!!!! 💞🤘
Mr flea em ação
I managed to get myself a advanced copy of the new album and listened to all the new songs. Most of them are quite excellent. And the album itself is truly a work of art. One disappointment though that I have to share with my fellow fans. You're not going to hear those beautiful choruses with Anthony and John like we heard on By the Way and californication.  In my humble opinion, this album focuses primarily on Anthony kiedis's vocals and lyrics. Anthony's vocals are excellent and spot on. We also hear a lot of Base chords with flea and also some trumpets solos as well. Don't expect to hear a lot from John's guitar because he seems to have taken a subdued style of playing on this album allowing flea and Anthony to shine. Here are the songs in order: Black Sunday Here ever after Aquatic mouth dance Not the one Poster child The great apes It's only natural She's a lover These are the ways What you thinking Bastards of light White braids and pillow chair One-way traffic Veronica Let him cry The heavy wing Tangelo
Frusciante is a God!
nice
Just when you thought the world was ending
Actually an excellent song... Red Hot Chili Peppers formula working very well indeed... Powerful lyrics and a great guitar sound
This is an awesome song, and the video is great too. RHCP never disappoint me. Keep rocking till you guys drop dead.
solo animal de bom 😀
♥️
2033 and still listening to this Masterpiece
Anthony... Now that you have Mr F back... And he didn't gd die... Grow your hair again pussy... Put on that vinyl flame suit you sported at the MTV whogivesaf awards and let's rock n roll....🤣 ... But seriously. Thank you for being a part of my most fondest memories with BSSM... and more importantly... One Hot Minute...IMHO...the most underrated album of all time... It was special to me.. Thanks guys.
this song is gold
Grande John!
oh
Ladies and gentlemen, Will Farrell on drums.
“The ‘durk’ side of the moon”- Anthony got some kind of Celtic fantasy inflection to his voice or something
Flea is such an incredible bassist!!!!
FLEA é a energia, JOHN é a alma, ANTHONY é a voz e CHAD é o coração que bate forte!!!  RED HOT É VIDA!!!!!  KD OS BRAZUCA REPRESENTANDO?
This is the first time I've ever heard this song and immediately I can tell it's John playing on the recording compared to if it was Josh playing on the recording of an original song. People hate on the Dave Navarro era of the peppers but imo that was their best run without John.. one hot minute is an underrated peppers album and they had a few hit singles from that period like aeroplane, and my friends. I have no ill will towards him but when it comes to the Josh Klinghoffer era I cant name one hit single from his era and I never got into the music they did with him no matter how hard I tried. I feel like Josh was a knock off John Frusciante lol. Atleast Dave had his own style. You can't deny the magic and chemistry these 4 dudes have together. Glad to see John back with the peppers!🌶🎸
Gracias RHCP!!!
This album is ultimate masterpiece to me. It turned my life upside down, I feel like a completely newborn person. I just love it unlimitedly.
Waiting for another auto tuned single again.
They finally release a good song. It’s been a while. Great job rhcp!
I love you guys... Please carry on like this as always.. love love
This could have been on any of your legendary albums.
Yawn
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Frusciante,as we say in Italy,FENOMENO.
глуууупый мотылек догорал на свечке жаркий уголеееек дымные колечки
don't forget to get the messages guys, both visual and text btw thank you rhcp for putting it out there for so long
Subscribed again. I dont have to explained why 🖤🖤🖤🖤😎
China's on the 'dirk' side of the moon...
I'd end the song about at about 2:48, but I am not a musician so that'd probably a terrible way to do it and I just don't know.
Garbage. Who listens to this
Yeah. Fuck yeah!
This is so original, Consistent & damn good. Merinding riffNya john.
'China's on the dark side of the moon' is an incredibly clever lyric. So are you saying that they present a red flag?
on mushrooms rn, i love these guys so much
Overall a good song  The guitar sounds like 100% John Frusciante ...
2:20 that transition... omg
Californication 2.0
Yes! Just yes! ♡
Not a fan of their latest stuff, but this might be their best song imo. Just amazing
Not really a winner here, and I’m a fan of RHCP.
This song kicks ass
Tan legendarios y tan buenos como la primera vez que los escuche de niño
Essa música dos chilipepers originais ficou top demais brother!
I cant stop listening this song
Listen to L. S…..I Need You….reminds me of this sound❤️
Borrowed that lead guitar sound from The Guess Who…
Essa música é boa pra caralho, da red hot chilli peppers are back!
O RHCP , me fez voltar no tempo agora ... Parabéns pelo novo trabalho \m/
Mucho Gusto
So maluco FODAAA
A magia voltou
I didn't know Will Ferrell played drums...
MYTH BUSTED......People say as you get older your creativity is gone.......RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS BREAK THE MOLD.......BUSTED
Music across 5 decades and still sh*t hot 🔥
I've been so lost recently but after finding and listening to this I feel more prepared for my own problems thank you
This is the music ped-os listen to in the elevator on the way down to hell
brings tears to my eyes...
Had no idea… unreal
That is a Song that you can hear every time!
The Irish accent is as funny as Madonna's British accent... put your shirt on little man, stop touching little kids and just know that Taylor is stoking the fires in hotel 666 for you and flea 😉
Such a good song
Ummm, Epstien's plane log...? Ped-o pieces of crap.  Why are they not locked up?
Riding on a censorship- I like it. Kiedis looks awful, but the sound is so good.
Hinting at the darkness that's overtaking - the time to put our faith in God is here and now.
Thank you rhcp... Nice songs
Wow- Listening to this for the first time instantly took me back to the late 90s and early 2000s when I discovered Californication, Stadium Arcadium, and BSSM. Good on you guys for staying true.
I honestly quit listening to RHCP when John left. I thought I'd give this song a shot and was pleasantly surprised to hear/see him.
Wtf is this bs. If john can't fight for the rights. Then it's over.
Good grief, this song is terrible.  I saw the chili peppers back with Mothers milk, BSSM... this is pure grade A crap.  If you like this song, then you hate the chili peppers when they made real music.  Would hellywood and all these ped-Os just go away already...

Thank GOD John is back and in full fucking force! I love this more than I can put into words, thank you for bringing so much joy and happiness for such a long time. RHCP forever 🖤
satisfying to see john frusciante back
After listening all album best song is definetely IT'S only natural. What a chemistry and good music. Thank you John. Quality is very good. Rick Rubin produced it very good. Drum is hearing very well,guitar parts also,bass very very good. First album with John that actually he is not the main guy but every of them is great. I was crying and laughing yesterday after hearing some songs. You are my love RHCP.
🤟🤟🤟
Frusciante is back yeahhhhhhh

A covid song? The band would have had a MASSIVE number one hit if the 2020 election was not Rigged and Stolen. Instead it's Loserville throwback garbage. Very Sad and a waste of time. Rough but True.
the legend is ......
John😍
I gotta admit, first listen wasn't too crazy about this song. Wasn't and still not crazy about how Anthony does that little leprechaun accent on the first few verses. The more I listen though, the more I'm enjoying this song. It's definitely a grower and man....Frusciante's solo was exactly what I was looking for. Glad to have you guys back!
There is something magical that happens when John, Chad, Flea and Tony make music together.
Y’all are my California dreamin fabulous friends. Love you so very much. Proud of who you are now and always. Rock on peppers. F yeah!!!!!!
All these years and I had no idea Will Farrell was such a good drummer.
With John back the Peppers are complete again and the rock Will live again
This is the real Red Hot Chili Peppers line up. They're back. Hell yeah
I honestly think John's guitar solo at 1:52 is one of the best solos he's ever created.
God, they're old! Still rocking and making great music! My favorite band, RED HOT CHILI FUCKING PEPPERS!!!! 🤘🔥🌶
I dont Like it, i Love it 😍😍😍😍😍
Welcome back guys!!!  ❤❤❤
When did John Wick become the lead guitarist?!
ooo shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ppl ooo shiii
I didn't know Will Ferrell played drums that good
Io amo i RHCP ....che bello rivedere John ....ci vediamo a Firenzeeeeeeeeee
Is this about the BLM riots? as they successfully ended racism and proved the stereotype completely wrong - mission successful gang gang
That haircut and stash looks pedo creepy
❤️❤️❤️❤️💋
Brilliant. Just staying true to what they believe in.
Wait that's John fruciante his back..that perferct now rhcp cool👍
Amazing
My god so godly music, I love the music RHCP.
Chinas on the dark side of the moon
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a big part of my history. And they are going again. Love this keep going Dudes.
Funny, I haven't been checking out  RHCP for a while since The Getaway. So I wasn't aware of Frusciante's return to the band at all. So when I heard this song the very first time, I knew it must be Frusciante on the guitar and not Klinghoffer because that's how it just sounded. So I then started checking the internet what was going on and then I found out Klinghoffer had left and Frusciante being back. That's just awesome! How tf could I have missed that major change? :) To me Frusciante simply belongs to the RHCP.
Honestly if any other band made this video it would be a little cheesy or corny. However. With red hot doing this video. It’s absolutely mesmerizing. Not to mention they sound as amazing as ever!! One of my favs from them. And I’ve been listening to them since the late 90s 😂
it's official. nobody can make the mullet and moustache combo look cool!
Red Hot é Red Hot né pai !
WHERE'S JOHN ON THE NEW STUFF????
Hey everyone! Check out my piano interpretation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers´ beautiful classic "Under The Bridge" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaaaxTIlxqA  (including an improvised solo and some interesting rhythmic variations) - have a great day!
💟💟💟💟💯🔝✨✅🌈
Black Sommer
I love you
Me devolvieron a mí infancia gracias
All about Covid and War in Ukraine, yawn.  All their stuff is symbolic, they sold their soul to Satan yawn
Greatest band of our generation
Hard to believe this came out right before the war in ukraine started. Interesting times we live in.
Great to here this.Love it so much.I feel like I'm back in high school.So glad you kept your iconic sound!
Pray for my friends that not liked RHcP yet
a música nos créditos no final do mundo vai ser essa
So happy  John is back❤ this is my fave so far of the new tunes. Stadium Arcadium still remains my fave LP probably always will . Take it easy guys  LOVES XOXO❤❤❤❤
Pra mim já é sucesso, muito boa
Terribile
Man this fuckin tune is cool.... RHCP all day. Love it!
te amo john frusciante, te amo fuerte me hace bien verte de nuevo
Ok, Uplift mofo was 1987.. it is 2022.. they have been making gold + albums for 35 years!! This is insane! I’m going through my head and I’d say only The Rolling Stones and Pearl Jam have even come close to this longevity.
Please make sure that all of your who had something to say rather nice or not or even if you viewed this wonderful musical art. Please make sure you VOTE.. We all must come together at one point in time how about now.. Vote those out of office who have no regards or respect for nature and of the lives of our young ppl. Vote these old foggies out of office now before we all melt away.. Love
💙
Anthony still looks ripped, amazingly good at age 59. Right, on! Inspiration for all of us, younger folks.
El coro de Jhon ❤️
Sounds like it belongs on Stadium Arcadium and im not complaining.
Wowww, Red Hot Chilli 🌶💥💥💥
Will Ferrell is a hell of a drummer.
that. was. true. old. school. RCHP.
Never been a Fan of them...but this Album is very clearly spoken...and they are Keepin it real as always
Amazing all the music of red hot chili pepers is AMAZING congratulacions 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘👍
1999 Vibes...
Klasik... Ciri khas bngtz 😘😘😘
시이이이아발 사랑해요 형들
They may be old, but they are still the best ;)
I thought they already wrote this song and called it slow cheetah. 🤷‍♂️
It was better in Skate Heaven.
I seriously thought this was an old song of theirs when I first heard it on the radio. That just means that they’ve never lost their sound! I love it
We missed you, John. Thanks, RHCP. Thank you all. My soul is back thanks to you. I had been waiting too.
OHHHH MY GOD!!!! IT'S JOHN FRUSCIANTE!!!!! RHCHP is BACK!!!!!!
I love how you can tell John is playing without even seeing him
Somewhere,Danzig isn't happy!!🤔😑
😁
The #1 Band on my list
This is the best of the currently released singles, but all of them are great.  I've always been a fan of good bands with distinct sounds.  Nobody sounds like RHCP and they have not lost a step.
This song kicks ASS! The Chili Peppers are BACK!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The guys are in great shape!! They’re amazing!!
It all comes together always an forever ♾️
I gotta be honest... the Chili Peppers never really was in my playlists over the years. Just never really got into their music. I knew it was good, but wasn't drawn to it. Indifferent.   I really like this song.
I've been waiting for this since 2006, these are the RHCP that blew my mind so long ago
Bro the imagery on the thumbnail nuclear apocalypse
Am I alone in that it sounds like he’s singing with an Irish accent? Lol
Digging the new song . I discovered the peppers  way back in 97 have been a fan all these many years layer. It sure has been a rollercoaster of love of the peppers
This song could've came out 20 years ago it holds true to their style  Does that mean that they as individuals haven't grown or does it mean that they've found their true identity?
Those Frusciante Solos. What a feeling returned.
This is one of the best songs I have ever heard. Seriously, this is an instant classic!
Obra de arte
Perfeito excelente fantástico o melhor 👏👏👏👏👏😍😍
4 musical geniuses, that so happen to meet, and gel like no other, EVER! And Frusciante, no disrespect to Chad,  Flea, and Anthony,,, but John, you amaze me! You understand the fundamentals. You and Flea fill in each others gaps, unparalleled! Gives Flea a chance to bounce around and explore. Chad holds everything together, funky ghost note son of a.. and Anthony flows over all that with crazy unique lyrical madness! I love you guys! Create more together. You guys know the importance... Thank you!!!
Brilliant track. Wow RHCP are back and damn is this the way to announce it.
Welcome back boys!!
Am I the only one who thinks this does not hit as hard as their past music (don’t hate me I love this band)
2:50
😍😍😍
In my opinion they have never lost their style. They know what we like and they just give it to us having fun at the same time. Love you guys.
Gotta love John's searing lead notes! Oh how I've missed this...
love ❤️
What a stinker....its not complete garbage just not interesting at all.
🤘🤘🤘
Sounded good but why he singing like a Irishman???
Guys, do yourself a favor. Don't just listen listen this on your phone. Play it on a nice stereo or surround sound if you have one. It's such a rich sounding tune. And play it LOUD
HE appeared during the chorus for a brief second,  lord was I smiling, and then he burst a solo, I was gobsmacked.
Anthony is slowly but surely turning into Iggy Pop
Soy una lluvia perezosa Los cielos se niegan a llorar La cremación toma su parte de su suministro  La noche se viste de mediodía Un marinero habló demasiado pronto Y China está en el lado oscuro de la Luna (Escúchame ahora)  Ornitorrinco son algunos la vida secreta de roo Una personalidad que nunca conocí (Ponte en marcha)  Mi cráter pesa una tonelada El arquero está huyendo Y nadie está solo detrás del sol  Ha pasado mucho tiempo desde que hice un nuevo amigo. Esperando a que termine otro verano negro Ha pasado mucho tiempo y nunca se sabe cuándo Esperando a que termine otro verano negro  Atrás el látigo en llamas Están navegando en nuestra censura Montar en un caballo sin cabeza para hacer el viaje.  Ha pasado mucho tiempo desde que hice un nuevo amigo Esperando a que termine otro verano negro Ha pasado mucho tiempo y nunca se sabe cuándo Esperando a que termine otro verano negro  he estado esperando he estado esperando Esperando a que termine otro verano negro  he estado esperando he estado esperando Esperando a que termine otro verano negro  he estado esperando he estado esperando Esperando a que termine otro verano negro🎸🎵🎸🎶
I think the lasting effects of Johnny utah punching Kiedis in the face adversely impacted the band
the bell peppers ceased being a rock band a long time ago, B leaguers
Ah yes twas around the arcadium when we were last graced with those beautiful locks an melodies can't wait to see what type of harmonics he works up on this album... #FuckJosh
Magic song! John's guitar solo is one actually the best 🤩
Anyone else hearing the Irish accent/melody in Anthony's voice? :D
Ви найкращі❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not my fav song from them. It’s terrible.
Johns part reminds me of him and Flea doing The Dying Song
When u hear those riffs and chorus, u knw the great Frusciante is back.. Hail u, Guitar Jesus..
Que tema❤❤❤❤😍
My god…this is one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard from one of the most overrated bands ever. All they do is let Kiedis rap or sing terribly about summer or fucking. John Frusciante’s talent is wasted with this group.
That's it. The peppers are back.
Total disaster and a shame to see Mr. Frusciante pessimistic. The next album should 100% Trumped and OPTIMISTIC.
dudes kinda shredded
i love ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I don't want a black summer to be honest!
Obr por existir !!!#rhcp amo!!!!🎯😍🎵🎶🎵🎶🎶🎶
its good to see Will Ferrel in good shape after all these years

That’s definitely will Farrell on the drums
❤️❤️
Estou emocionada com essa volta maravilhosa. Essa música tá simplesmente perfeita, tá simplesmente RCHP. É como se fosse um vinho guardado por anos... traz toda a vibe de Stadium Arcadium, é incrível como essa banda maravilhosa NUNCA abandona a essência mágica das músicas. Simplesmente impecável. É, e sempre sera minha banda favorita.
When is someone gonna make the Danzig/RHCP mashup for Dirty Black Summer?
2:50    Is that an LP needle drop?
The kind of band that doesn’t have to keep up with the times - they just are, and always will be, the Chilis
I’ve never known what this guy was talking about.. Maybe it’s time
Thanks God you're still around. Please never leave us.
Love the Hendrix-esq guitar licks, and great lyrics. RHCP again deliver another great song.
Obra de arte em forma de música. RHCP sempre com músicas incríveis.
This is so John Frusciante <3 Love it!

BEAUTIFUL 💖
Muy felices en verdad por el regreso del espectacular John y claro y solo lo supera el echo de que estén haciendo música otra vez los 4 .... afortunadamente son tantas canciones tan enormes obras maestras que fue suficiente para mi ..para poder soportar la espera....siiiii
De la manera más humilde y bueno también alucinada diré lo siguiente.... No hay ninguna forma de no sentir esta canción... y ya la hice mía es mi vida ...toda mi vida en potente musica, tristes versos ...interpretada por el ser más hermoso que mis ojos han visto y verán... ¿Es un sueño? Que nadie me despierte.
Johns guitar playing is well... just John. On point as usual. Such a beautiful lead on this.
From Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic album ? Obviously not but the sound fits perfectly ♥️
What a great great band.. still this good all this time... inspirational
One word...Timeless!
John!!!!!
I thought John was coming back, not Keanu Reeves
ジョン戻ったんだね、嬉しい。
Obrigado.
Platte direkt bestellt .....
Cant wait for the entire album 🔥😍
Avant j'avais peur qu'on se quitte ❤‍🩹
Great on all levels - signature song  structurally and vocally- great video and lyrics capture what we've all been through . WAY TO GO RHCP !
Пацаны просто кайфуют!
Slow Cheetah vibes
Bullshit band ONLY WASP AND RATT
Como não amar esse som....
Eddie guererro
A song like I heard before... Come back songs like one in Californication!
meu deus frusciante obrigada :')
frushi es y será joven forever.
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry,  Я есть ленивый дождь, небо не прольёт слёз,  Cremation takes its piece of your supply.  Кремация отщипывает кусочек от твоих запасов.  The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon,  Ночь в наряде дня, моряк слишком рано открыл рот,  And China's on the dark side of the moon. (Hear me now)  А Китай на тёмной стороне луны. (Послушайте меня)    Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo,  Утконосов можно сосчитать по пальцам, тайная жизнь Ру,  A personality I never knew. (Get it on)  Личность, которую я так и не узнал. (Вставай)  My crater weighs a ton, the archer's on the run,  Мой картер тянет на тонну, лучник пустился в бега,  And no one stands alone behind the sun.  И никто не встаёт один позади солнца.    It's been a long time since I made a new friend  Давно я уже не заводил новых друзей, Waitin' on another black summer to end,  Всё ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.  It's been a long timе and you never know when  Давно это было, уже не узнать когда,  Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Пока ждёшь, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.    Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship,  Ударь огненным бичом, пройди под парусом по цензуре,  Riding on a headless horse to make the trip.  Пустись в путь на безголовом коне.    Been a long time since I made a new friend  Давно я уже не заводил новых друзей,  Waitin' on another black summer to end,  Всё ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.  It's been a long timе and you never know when  Давно это было, уже не узнать когда,  Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Пока ждёшь, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.    I've been waitin', I've been waitin',  Я всё ждал, я всё ждал,  Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.  I've been waitin', I've been waitin',  Я всё ждал, я всё ждал,  Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.  I've been waitin', I've been waitin',  Я всё ждал, я всё ждал,  Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Ждал, когда же кончится ещё одно чёрное лето.
I never stopped listening to your music. I "discovered" RHCP in 1991, I was twelve!  I remember blushing on some lyrics, while learning English (Brazilian Portuguese is my mother language). Thanks Goddess Parental Advisory didn't exist in Brazil at that time, or I could not have bought RHCP's albums.  Thirty one years later and I still adore the vibes end energy of your songs!  I witnessed many formations to the band, but I can't lie that it is always a pleasure to hear John Anthony Frusciante chords. So great!  Love you guys! 😍
🌞🌞🌞
Axl Rose is out of shape
At 0:55 "drums please, Chad?"
toda música do red hot chili peppers é perfeita, to viciada to escutando desde a semana que lançou <3
Time flies but the music is the same!! ♥♥♥ I'm so fck old
The frusciante flea combo is something special

Lmfao what are you Irish now.. What a joke
It felt like this song came out long ago but I’m glad it just came out 😂
Love John's use of triads like Jimi Hendrix. 🙏
Mr Slave
🤘🏻😁🤘🏻
I could listen to this song over and over again without getting tired
This is how it should sound, thank you John
Will Farrell is a legend!
Es una excelente mixtura entre los RHCP, Locomotive Breath de Jethro Tull y A Hard Days Night de los Beatles!

This band has always taken me too places i couldn't go without their music. Thank you.
I just feel 20 years younger... Not many bands can do that! RHCP! Timeless music
Llorando porque John está de vuelta🥰🥰🥰🥰
🌞 🤟
The skies refuse to cry. It's me who is simply crying...
🤘🏼❤✊🌶👑
Damn. Never thought I'd see or bette ryet hear a new song.
Will Farrell is such a good drummer.
Yo no leo la biblia yo la escucho 😎
cringe
Wow 2022!! Who ever thought that Ray Romano, Will Ferrell, the guitarist from The Mars Volta and Flea would start a band together?!
Man, I almost completely forgot about summer 2020. Why'd you have to go and remind us?
Chilli peppers
100% chill peppers
The new Rolling stones
Nach so langer Zeit endlich wieder so ein toller Song von den RHCP zu hören , ich hab sie  so vermisst, einfach wieder ein grandioser Song der die Düstere Zeit hier auch auch aufzeigt in der wir uns gerade befinden danke .
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
That MOUSTACHE!!!!!
That feeling when you listen to RHCP from your childhood to adulthood.  I hope they will accompany me for a long time. I feel rare that there is an opportunity to go to a concert of Gods of music.
Good music by real musicians stands the tests of time
I just recently inherited my late great-grandfather's Montgomery Ward Airline Alarm clock radio that has not been powered on since 1988, when he passed away and 9 years before I was born... I powered it on to initial silence, but after fiddling with the clock knob on the back, this was the first song to play on the radio in over 34 years. The clock was dated to have been manufactured anywhere between 1965 to 1970. Talk about the right song to bring new life into an unrestored 50-year-old radio!
ANTHONY, CHAD, FLEA, JOHN THANKS FOR SHARING BEAUTIFUL MUSIC SENDING LOVE FROM THE PHILIPPINES 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🧡🧡🧡
RIP replay button....
welcome bank mr frusciante
ジョンのストラトの音が最高や！ たまにカートコバーンに見えるけど
Thank God Johns back
ESTÁN DE VUELTA! ESPERÉ TANTO ESTE MOMENTO, RHCP ❤
看到討厭跑步的老周的介紹，特別跑來朝聖 ！ 真的很好聽，吉他Solo果然厲害 ！
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvhghxJBvk v
아 모야 겁나좋아
Excellente chanson, bravo à vous
This is what the crack heads you see on a Sunday morning think is happening
fuckin autotune???
RHCP Yeahhhhh. Nice
Finally something goes right.   John is finally back with the peppers.
so fresh as always
ILL BE AT YOUR CONCERT IN NORTH CAROLINA!!!
Welcome back, John. ☝🏼
Red vcs  arrebentam mesmo  , ( magnífico)👍🖖
eles fazem melhor? não. parece a mesma coisa? sim. mas é bom? PRA UM KRLHO. pow mano sai album do rchp vc ja sabe q é bom
They are part of my generation and this song is awesome glad to have John Frusciante back!
los amo con toda mi alma sean eternos por favor❤❤❤❤
Maravilhoso,belissimo.
Always love when "dark" is pronounced like "dirk". Such a great song. Fuck the red hot chili peppers
THANKS FROM HIFA ISRAEL
É um privilégio ouvir esses caras em uma época tão difícil como os dias de hoje, guerra, pandemia, fome, miséria... Efim Rhcp me trás muitas alegrias em meio a tanta desgraça 👏🙌 Obrigado!! Vocês são demais!!
My favorite song from them yet! Amazing to sound like themselves but grow and improve. I can't think of another example of a band evolving in such a manner. To sound so classic yet so cutting edge. I never comment and I felt compelled to do so. It's no wonder the rest of the world wants to move to California, lol. Y'all can thank the Red Hot chili peppers for that!
So fucking happy John is back!
At least there’s still some bands out there that keep good music coming
That was legit. Can't wait for the tour
3:11 Spinning Anthony Kiedis reminds me of slane castle Californication 😊
nice song
Roll on April 1st 😍😍😍
I Need this song performed by Metallica, idk but i feel some James Hetfield vibes, like a death magnetic 0.o
oh is this the jojo reference
miss you guys so much
他lei了！等了5年！
John look like john wick
What happened to the other guitarist?
I love this song and can’t wait for the album to drop 💯🔥
JYNA
YES!
Love them forever!! My ultimate favorite band till the end of time !!
I hope live comming soon.🙏🙏🙏
China's on the dark side of the moon ???
the wait was so worth it
Fuck this sucks
What Anthony has against shirts?
They should have quit after Californication
Brennan is still paying Dale's drum set...
Legend..🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍
👌👍👌👍
As a Chili Peppers fan of 35 years, I have to say that this is not their best work, even with Frusciante back in the fold. I idolize him as a guitarist and musician and his guitar work here is incredible as usual, but the song itself I'm not so sure about. I've listened to it about 10 times, trying to like it but I don't know. Not feeling it.
Why is John Wick playing Guitar ? :D
John is back!
Hadir🇮🇩
With anyone else but John playing guitar, it wouldn't  sound this good. These 4 are the RHCP!!
Why does Anthony cut his own hair?
memories unlocked
John's guitar may save us ... but not this track .... hope the rest of this offering is stronger.
John coming back is huge for them
🤙
This makes me happy. Hehe
1:52 He's back.
Anthony turns 60 in November. Think on that.
Sorry all you kiddys  raving about this stuff --- check out the Mofo Party Plan ,,, when RHCP were GRAND
Frucciante , le devolviste el alma al grupo . Sin desmerecer al anterior guitarrista , frucciante ... Hiciste que red hot chilli peppers volviera a brillar como antes . Transmiten vibra positiva, hoy tengo temas nuevos para mi lista gracias a ustedes , red hot chilli peppers lo mejor lml
shite
Mark my word, The Songs and RHCP will live 500 years. Timeless
RHCP never disappoints
Love this band no matter how long time has passed.
And they’re still fire 🔥
Good to see Will Ferrell still a killer on the drums.
Good to see John back. We love you brother. These guys are pushing for greatest band ever
Los amo. ❤
@Red Hot Chili Peppers It's been a long time since I made a new friend, too  When are you coming to Israel for a visit?? Come surf with me y'all  🤘🌶🤘🌶🤘🌶🤘🌶🤘🌶🤘🌶
When I thought life sucked...here comes rhcp.
Very weak single
Good to see John Frusciante back!His style of guitar play and Flea on bass is the glue of thier music.Anthony is just Anthony on vocals.A true legend.
How’d they get Will Ferrell to play the drums? Lol jk
Love it
Oh god! Frusciante is back!!!!!!!
Great
Still fuckin got it. Like always
I get a 50/50 vibe of Californication and Stadium Arcadium with generous dashing of Can't Stop/Under The Bridge.  Simply because the Frusciante Factor is back.
omg I love you
So I do like the song, great guitar work. But does nobody else get Kermit the frog vibes during “and chinas on the dark side of the moon”?
Lo mejor que pudo haber salido en el 2022
Rhcp + Jonh fruciante= song top1
when's this Odyssey over, boys? anyhow, in return for you entertain me, here's mines. grab yo selves a nice Wing Dinner and crank up my brand new song.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-YOk5byzEc
Love the new Chilli 🌶 s
This feels like the same vibe that Stadium Arcadium gave me. Good stuff.
This time I am be alone. This song helped to replace my hart. ♥️
Anthony and the band total genius great song, meaning, video sights.
Okay. First love this song. But GD I have to give props to Anthony for his health and fitness…. That body 😲🤤ummm
Im not sure the world realizes how legendary this band is so good soo long nvr to be repeated again in any genre    RHCP 4 LIFE
This summer can be any summer you want. Go make some new friends... and make sure they're good ones! Love to all who read this!
Glad to see Will Ferrell improve on his drumming skills.
Love it
Isso é rock porra🎸🇧🇷
Я из России и мне очень нравиться что вы делаете😘
Складывается впечатление, что Кидис пытается быть похожим на Игги.
The ultimate players band that just keeps getting better!
I LOVE YOU
Either ur to high or not high enough wtf, u can't depend on solo. Just no no fuck me im going to need to take crack again to like this
Vengan a Uruguay boooooo
aguante los red hot pariente!
The hair cut is different.
Hell Yes!!! 🔥🔥🔥
God damn I really enjoy your music guys 🔥🙌
Good old Red Hot Chili Peppers is  come back.
Looking like recycled junkies OMG
Will Ferrell is rocking that drummer! 🤣
Again,fuckin' masterpiece!Easily.
It’s very good, but I don’t understand why everyone talks that “RCHP are back”, they haven’t been gone, «The Getaway” is an amazing LP!
How can u so far away from me? I meet u again... Great joy. U missed me. Kiss from an old French guy... We grow up together.
David Kitt vibes
😍
What kinda gay masonic symbolism is going on in this video
La escucho diario!!! Los amo
Is Anthony attempting to sound a bit Irish on this?
oh and it's not that jesus is back :o (frusciante is back!) this is a great blessing for the peppers to return to the original lineup that everyone loves Congratulations to the band this sound was very time !
Happy they are back.  Like this song very much.  Would love for Anthony to shave that mustache.
Love there music
Amazing!
So good
Can't believe that these guys are still around still kicking ass.The first time I  ever saw these guys was on the Arsenio Hall show back in the 80s and these dudes are still doing it...much respect guys
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
All of us who have always been Chili Peppers fans need this affirmation that the band brought us that we still have some fight in us.
Frusciante is back and they haven’t sounded this good in what feels like years. I missed their original sound SO much. Saw them live 10 years ago when I was 18 and hoping to see them again this fall in Boston. Cheers, Chili Pepper Fam! ❤️🙏🏼
Os VERDADEIROS  RHCP estão de volta!!! Fantástico som...
Some bands just have it from the start but few manage to keep it. They still got it
the desire to leave liking all the comments without knowing the least English is great. By: Google tradutor
Booooooyaaah
Still strong, wonderful & beautiful!
To me it sounds fab till the drums kick in, which sound simplistic (after enjoying John's solo music and breakbeat for some time). I don't feel the refrain nor the lyrics. John's solo sounds nice but no goosebumps. The rest of the song lacks any magic to the point were I find Anthony's singing annoying. Poster Child sounds different but also isn't my cup of tea. Looking forward to the rest of the album.
We missed you men!
Missed their music with frusciante
Finally the suffering has ended for them to make a new song!!!
Revivendo uma época com esse som, bem vindo de volta, energizados e com a mesma essência! Obrigado!
john wick
The nice black summer music video for 2022, Boys! : )
Res Hot Chili Peppers simplesmente tem o melhor som de todos ♥️
The John reveal was perfect in this. It teased you from Fleas smile and the camera building from the guitar to Johns face. Gimme John
I missed u guys so long I cry when I listen to this song
John Frusciante… they sound like the chilli peppers when ever he is back in the band! Welcome back home John!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Romans 10:9-13 9If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God is risen from the dead, you will be saved. 10For with the heart one believes to righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses to salvation. 11 As the Scripture says, "Whoever trusts in him will never be put to shame." 13for "everyone who calls on" is "everyone who calls on."
John 14:6 6Jesus answered, "I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father (the Creator), except through me.
More plaese
Ngeriii boi
Holy fuck this is good. Classic Chili Peppers.
I can't believe hes 59 yo already
Red Hot é sensacional. Com o John Frusciante é ainda muito mais sensacional!
again i must John, for me - you are - rhcp but now - is his time it is old rhcp with John - vs - new rhcp with Josh is it simple choice? - no! but... Josh is
UFFFF TEMASO REVIVEN 14 AÑOS EN MI <3
Even 30 years later, they still managed to maintain the sound of the band despite how different it sounds from the mainstream music of today
Finally New music using real instruments and no samples, the real deal  !
Frusciante back in business.
Goosebumps...
Omg... I don't have the words. 😄 It's so amazing !! I love this music ! Seriously, good job 😍 I'm a big fan !! 😍😍😍😍
Just great, as usual !
Top...the red hot is the Best
John Frusciante slaying it!!!
One of the only bands that didnt start  to suck over time
You can just tell Unlimited Love is going to have some monster songs on it
:)
🔝🔝🔝
Oh! Anthony that mustache has to go !!
I love what Anthony has done with the vocals...so cool!
You've done it again. Brilliant.
Челики уже дедушки но еще в теме)))
Mexico que es un mundo donde abunda el Regueton y la Musica de banda romantica, esto nos cae como agua fresca.
Long time Chili Pepper fan.... but this is lackluster at best. Energy is not there, lyrically mediocre and what's up with Anthony's Slingblade/Porn-stache look? I know it's not popular opinion, but this was a let down from an otherwise amazing band.
Like a trip back through time. It feels sooooooo damn good to have these guys back! This sounds like prime Peppers, they haven't lost even a tiny bit of that energy!
Always THE BEST!!
Wow this is truly a gift ❤
I love that John is back
Amazing
Hey check check
This song was straight fucking garbage
brings back alot of memories wow good stuff
Incredible band!  The tash not so much wish that thing would go 🤣
They are so beautiful, and this song makes me happy and peaceful💘
Los mejores, excelente música llega al alma
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Oxz0jvy78 v
I remember hearing Scar Tissue for the first time on MTV back in the day and fell instantly in love. RHCP will forever be in my heart, love you guys, best band and best music! ❤
Oh great more BLM crap this summer.
1:53' God I miss that sound!!!
Whenever I hear them on the radio I still picture Anthony clean shaven with his long hair. Now he just looks like that neighbor you didn’t want to mess with back in 1995.
Is it just me or does this sound like an AI's attempt to write a RHCP song based on their earlier songs?
Joe Exotic hair.
Gg
I enjoyed the song and much more from the band, but this clip made my stomach hurt. Worst of all, he must have paid very well for it.
Rhcp has used corona virus lockdown to fullest.
🔥❤️
Ouch!! Love the song! The song...no!! The archer?!! You’re too good. This song has too much
RHCP is so consistent in everything from their music to their performance to their fitness and fashion. From the day they came about to today. Day 1 fan here, am almost 50 yrs old and still listening to RHCP!!
RHCP forever ❣️
What’s with the fake accent?  It’s the Dred Pirate Roberts
Thank you 🙏🏼 RHCP for keeping doing such amazing music 🎵

Welcome again John Fucking Frusciante...Can you understand RHCP is ONLY ONE and without you are only three
Excelente ❤️
My homeboys!!!!!!!!  West L.A.!!!!!!!!!!!
Most bands plateau at some point. They just keep getting better.
One helluva song!
This song reminds me of Metallica.
Me gusta John con su estilo Stadium Arcadium!
,🇺🇦✌️
.... Ahí vamos con... Todo.... Va... Mos.. ✌🏾🖤🌌. Músic.. ...
They gotta be in the running for one of the greatest rock bands of all time at this point.  It’s been like 40 years of some of the most memorable and best songs on the radio.  Definitely in my top 5
GOAT 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
What a song! Getting Californication album vibes! 😊❤️So glad to have the original line up back especially the wonderfully talented Mr Fruiscante!
👍🇷🇺
Why am I afraid of this summer 🥺
Y Love you forever is my life 😍❤
Frusciante is back with his music, and gives goosebumps, Flea covers the whole band & provides the energy, Chad strums that drums like a bullet and Anthony got that deep chill voice. Love RHCP
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ARE MY LIFEEEEE!!!!!
Rubin rules, mtf)))
Rhcp on shrooms, I dig it! Loving the expiramentation with their sound. This is gonna be a total banger live
2:46  It was great
FRUSCIANTE FOREVER......
Просто лучшие!!!
❤❤❤💃
YESSSSSSSS!!!
This song is fucking unreal. Conjures up memories of 1991 when I was 18 and Blood, Sex, Sugar, Magik was dominating the airwaves. Same vibe, and it makes me feel young again.
Awesome 👌
The legends..
Love RHCP from Indonesia♥️ 🇮🇩👌
Isaiah 57:15  Thursday, March 17, 2022For this is what the high and lofty One says --- he who lives forever, whose name is holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.Isaiah 57:15
Regis Tadeu ''GRAAAAANDE MUSICO BRASILEIRO'' disse q a musica é ruim... faz outra ai Red Hot 🌶 kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I'll be seeing them in June x
Good to see Will Ferrell back drumming again.
🤘
Different but still that same chilli's sound..my favorite band is back. Been a fan since blood sugar 😁😁😁
Will Ferrell is still my favourite drummer. He holds this song together.
love you RHCP....bigtime!!!!!
I am listening this music because make me relax coming like therapy thank you mate red hot 😍
This song is 🔥🔥🔥 and the two getaway besides that just went uploaded by fans are also 🔥🔥🔥
So this hit my local rock station and I was listening along until that fucking solo kicked in and I was immediately brought to tears, Johns back, holy shit, I know that strat anywhere, shame on me for EVER doubting it would happen, but it has, and life is good again. Thanks John 🎸
Simplemente genial.
El solo de Frusiante es sexo visual
I'm glad to see Will Ferrell is killin it on the drums
Good ol RHCP
"China's on the derp side of the moon"

justin long as antony keyadaas
uncle rico!!
Incrível ver o John Frusciante de volta , foram 11 anos pedindo sua volta , viva o RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Anthony kiedis sounds like hes doing a bit of a decemberists Impression
They let joe exotic out ?
It's ok. A re-hash, nothing new. Kinda disappointed
One ofkind I was waiting for u guys woohoo 🎉 bby les goooo
Hello from Ukraine. When I was 5-6 years old. I lived with Grandma. And when I   came first to my  mother ( when  i was 7 yeas old )  I saw a poster where four naked men cover their dicks . I asked my mother, who is this? she said - these are hot peppers. After that, I had my own amazing life connected with music. I have a lot of respect for Peppers. Peace for everyone ! I hope the world sees the truth! P.S. Air raid sirens are blaring in my city right now, rock 'n' roll is dead and I'm not. But when peace comes, Ukraine will   show  that we can play music of our hearts  !

Yep. He's back.
come  on  AUG 17 i cant wait !!!!
So happy to see and hear this!
Nmrl, o John se destaca dms nessa música.
I keep forgetting that Will Ferrell is the drummer for RHCP.  Seriously, Frusciante is absolute gold.
I LUV U GUYS! U helped me survive ugly things through your music. God bless ya. Love the song.
their songs sound exactly the same since californication. it's the longest album ever recorded
Reminds me a bit of Chris Cornell
when did Kermit take over from Anthony
This is proper shit mate. Disappointed
The Chili Peppers will always Rock!! Been following them from the beginning and never disappoint. God bless you guys ❤️
https://youtu.be/c7sIxiwOVpk new song release
Hey John! Love that you came back to RHCP! & I just saw your sweet 1957 Gretsch eagle! Come pick it up lol & ^ ditto, it’s not easy trying to keep the essence of who you are, especially as a band moving forward. Beyond worldly kudos!
still on the origin soul of rhcp..i love it so much....
Anthony Kiedis is 80% of the way through his transition to Iggy Pop
loved it
Is it picture of Lenin on bass guitar?
John is the band
Playing this almost daily..need my fix.
That solo is so good, sounds like Time by Pink Floyd
Yes !!!!!!!!
Melhor banda do mundo
Sounding real fine. Share a bday with AK.
No BS rock and roll !! True to their sound, that guitar 🎸 amp sounds so crunchy. The album should be great ☺️👍🏻.
Anthony will always suck, I'm sorry. I love these guys but he'll always leave them in a very small box labelled Red Hot Chili Peppers. The other musicians are literally out of this world and could take the music so much further.  Good on em though for putting out new material, welcome back John 💜
These guys look great!
Are you guys coming to fortnite? I heard your song on the radio there. Would love to see some skins that look like you guys
My grandma loved RHCP since they've been around. She passed this past February.. They were her favorite band and it saddens me that she didn't live long enough to see their amazing comeback. Rip grandma, you were gone too soon😕
the song of he year, the video of the year and the best band forever!!
One Hot Minute until the end. Consider it your best album ever and play the songs on it LIVE. John, stop being childish and egotist, open up to the Creation of your band. Walkabout, Aeroplane, My Friends, Tearjerker, Transcending.... How can you erase all of that? Poor Human Creature.
This is by far the WORST song the RHCP have ever released!!!   I'm a huge fan of the band but, I'm extremely disappointed with this song.  I can only pray that this is the last "sack of shit" they release.  I hope I never hear this song again.
Addicted to Red Hot Chili Peppers
This makes me so happy! Welcome back John. Thank God! 🙏👏
I hate that I like his music.
Anthony is Gabriel Masse I have fought my demons all my life I love you I will see you one day my I speak French I sing your songs I have a talent that I did not know thank you Anthony Kiedis
Ficou tudooo de bom😍
Vim pelo anúncio do tik tok
Aaaaa eu amei💖

Man, they nailed it with this song. And the video.
😳😱😱🥳
April 1st can't come soon enough!
Best frontman out there
Am I the only one that thinks he's using autotune
Immensi ❤
"Hard to be a girl" by Adam Green has almost the exact same melody.

How to Play the Game of Life Why do children wake up with their eyes wide open and jump out of bed while we open them just wide enough to see the phone so we can set it to snooze? Why are young people energetic and ready to “conquer the world” while older people are cautious and hesitant? Can we stay young-spirited forever? After all, if life is not a game, there is no excitement in it. And if there is no excitement in life, what is the point of living? If we want to keep enjoying, we need to make life a lifelong game. This game is very different from anything we know. It is not about what we can receive, but about what we can discover! By connecting to other people, we discover new worlds, other people’s worlds! How do we achieve this? Quite simply, we need to focus on others rather than on ourselves. This may sound simple, but if you try it, you will realize how self-absorbed you are. We are all like that. Even those who feel that they are generous and giving are absorbed in their giving and do not see how much they do it for their own interest, and how they are focused on their own benefit when they give. Giving is fine, but the focus is the point here. Had the focus been on the receiver, the giver would have discovered countless revelations that are hidden from a self-centered eye. For the game to succeed, you need partners. It is impossible to play the game of giving without people to whom you can give and from whom you can receive. Therefore, there must be a group of people, up to ten or so, who play the game together. In order to succeed in discovering the other players’ worlds, we need to think good thoughts about them. Otherwise, we will have no incentive to approach them, no desire to discover their world. We can think good thoughts about each other if we do good things for one another. These can be the simplest things, but they must make us feel good about each other. Positive thoughts about each other bring us closer, and closeness opens our minds and hearts to others, so we can see the world through their eyes. As with any game, the more we practice, the better we get, and the harder, yet more rewarding the game becomes. But unlike any other game, as we improve in it, we will find that our entire perspective on life changes and expands, and we become wiser and more competent. The game of life, unlike any other game, reveals to us the secrets of life, the secrets of reality, because when you can look at something from all angles, nothing remains hidden from you.
I wonder how did you reach the right 90' feelin' 🤘👌
I’m going to be honest, I was never a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers for some reason (I know, it’s stupid).   But this song…  This song singlehandedly made a fan of them!! I may be late (super SUPER late) for becoming a fan, but nonetheless I am a fan..  FOR LIFE!
Can't say they don't write catchy singles. I think look around and Dark  Nes they have had me on loop on streaming services. This reminds me alot of slow cheetah
🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥

A paz de ouvir música de verdade, o RHCP tem de sobra.
This is better than any of their old music. 🔥
I love rhcp but the lyrics to this song make me contemplate suicide.  Not too sure they remain relevant at this point. Maybe hang it up lads
Música bem fraca!
Dam will ferrel getting better every day
What a great tune!
Will Ferrel is really good at the drums.
I know Chad is a great drummer, but he's getting a bit stale. Needs to dust off his chops...
JOHN　JOHN　JOHN　JOHN　JOHN　JOHN
Es la esencia de los RHCP👏👏👏🙌🙌
John is back !
DAMN!!!!!!
1.51 John is back people
Power to live! Thank you! You are great!
You give me power!
Red Hot remains the same Red Hot as always, it's good!
Beatiful Song! I listened that song when was waiting the birth of my daughter!
We need more songs from you too brighten up our spirits!
I have also been waiting for a black summer were the skies refuse to cry!!!!
As many have said, I love that RHCP have stuck to their individual style and kept the original essence of the band all these years instead of changing and conforming like most modern artists have to in order to stay relevant.  RHCP have played a massive role in my 24 years on this planet, they have always been mine and my dad's "thing" since I was a baby and our love for them is a bond that we share with each other and no one else that we know. It has been a lifelong dream for us to see them live and I feel so blessed that I was able to tell my dad that we are finally going to be seeing them this year.  Thank you for being so special to us both and being the thing that we will always share, no matter what. I listen to RHCP and am instantly flooded with so many happy memories with my dad that I will cherish forever, and I can't wait to finally be able to have this experience together ❤️
frusciante is baaackkkk
Coming soon to a retirement community near you..
❤️
Grande Bellerín, te juega el domingo y el martes conciertazo.
sempre perfeitos
They have kept the originality of their creations.
Pero que buena rolita!
That's what we needed!
AS MUCH AS I LOVE THEM.... It's a bland song and bland video...
O loved it! Isn’t amazing 😍
How is it possible to still be THIS bad ass after all that time? Welcome back John. We missed your guitar and vocals.
Good to see Will Ferrell playing again
✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳✳
Thailand
How old Is this song?
I would like to see put on a double album, a collection of all the b-side tracks. Many have never heard them. There are many and all but all of them could easily be hits.
❤️🌶️ 🇦🇷
This has got to be one of the best vocal performances by A.Kiedis.
Aye, y'all hear that new bop by red hot chilli pepper?
Black Gold.
Decades later and peppers stay true to their sound. That's rare..!!
It's cool to see Will Ferrell drum again.
Is it me, or does Anthony Kiedis sound different... Like he's trying to use an accent? Maybe I just haven't listened to them in long time, but he sounds different to me.
great track, if only we could hear the bass better though
20 milhões
How so? Anthony seams to never get old, those muscules, how old is he? Still 30?
Sounds like Moonlight by The Mind Orchestra.
I like the song more every time I hear it
The guitar solo part at 2:21 is interesting.
Joe exotics going crazy
I keep listening to this song. It’s a great song, but that guitar solo elevates it to another level!
That Mustache though
does anyone some similarities between the chorus of this song and the chorus of their im beside you song Long Progresion ???
Magistrale!! 🥰
Dumb song makes no sense
one of the last true rock/funk bands still out there--- RESPECT . fan since the 90's
Amazing guys, this band is a fountain of youth. Late 50s early 60s never looked so good gentlemen. Greetings from Venezuela
Beautiful. The last 10 seconds xx
What an incredible embodiment of all their music up until now. And side note, I hope Frusciante knows how much we all love him and are grateful for his work. These 4 are THEE Red Hot Chili Peppers.
On a censorship? Does the left regret the monster they’ve created? Beautiful song..
The autotune wtf
after they lost their funk vibe, the band got boring
This song’s a healer, i wear great respect for each of r h c p .  Salut from Romania 🇷🇴 a big fan that one day hope to see you
Always RED, always HOT, always CHILI!!! never dissapointing... Love you guys!!!
red hot chili pappers nunca pasan de moda con sus temazos
It sounds like Kermit The Frog singing a folk song on a pirate ship backed by a really good band. It's a really good song.
00:50 JOHN WICK? JSJSJAJSE NO WAYYYY...
Melody sounds like the foggy dew. Nothing wrong with that tho!
Nice, lyrcis still make as much sense as they always have :)
Fuck all this division. Remember back in the day when it never was real? Like today. Beautiful song
Man I want to get stoned, drink some wine and go cruising in a convertible !
Love it. Fruciante!!!
Never faded
Still can’t believe this is real..
The system already knows about about the war coming...
"The archer's on the runnnnnn"
When John is back everything starts to sound normal :)
I know I'm only 26 but I love how there music and style never change 💜💜💜💜
No ale zostarli nám chlopaci :)
Best John ❤️❤️
Heard this the first time and it instantly became a new favorite song for me. Love these guys
The monsters is gonna back... To your origins !
God bless Frusciante coming back. That sinergy between Flea and Jhon is unmatched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y_NW5ycJx4
OMG U GUYS THIS IS SO AWSOMEEEE i will never get tired of you guys!!!!!
My band, my music...!
Good to see Will Ferrel playing the drums again. Cheers!
Tão emocionante vê-los retornar novamente ❤
nah
thank god for frusciante back in the band
Kiedis pronunciation is fucking weird in this song.
how is anthony still this ripped
This song is about the black summer of 2020, he couldn't stand it.
Anthony is so amazing, I just cant get over his voice
Flea is still the bass king.
Blood Sugar sex best álbum RED HOT
Damn, Anthony's got some guns!
Primeira banda antiga q eu vejo q faz sucesso depois de anos
Suzanne albers
top of the top !!!
music is good , but movie is serpentine
What's going on with the vocals on this song?  Especially the china's on the dark side of the moon line.
"RHCP aren't what they used to be" A sailor spoke too soon.
Sucesso
This song will forever go with my truck. Every time I get in it this song plays everytime
Welcome home John. Now I can go see You guys live and not wish John was up there.
💜💜💜
Amazinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng
Welcome back Jon you fucking guitar master (I literally jizzed hearing you were back) much love to the 1 off sound you have x
Already listened to this song 100000 times super great tune !
We have been waiting for such a song for a long time.
GRACIAS POR EXISTIR  Y POR SER LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR  GRACIAS POR USTEDES SI SON LOS RHCP
Regresaron con fuerza y el sonido inconfundible de la guitarra electrica y la voz en los coros de John Frusciante es la escencia de los RHCP
DEEEEEEEEEE VUUUUUUEEEEEETAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YUUUUUUUUUjuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
John broke into 4th dimension with that solo and everything went dark😏😏😏
Se podesse dar mil likes eu dava...............

john frusciante is a god
Impressionante que o John ficou um tempão fora da Red, voltou exatamente com a essência da banda! Perfeitos🌟
😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stromae feat. John Frusciante ?  @
ALLAH save the Beatles and RHCP!
Okay I'm super stoked Frusciante is back and the sound is amazing but those lyrics are cryptic even for RHCP. "A Sailor spoke too soon, and China's on the dark side of the moon"? Da faq does that mean Anthony?
🌶🔥
Anthony is going full Iggy.  Lean and mean.
Minha banda preferida amo muito😍❤
Jedi frusciante strike back !!!
I want to cryy 😭😭😭😭
I thought the drummer and the comedy  actor is the same person.  The truth is not! Checking about Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith and Will Ferrell..
so refreshing to hear some new Frusciante.  He's one of the greats in my book.  So much soul.
Timecapsule! Great!
The Solo 😍😍😍
The Tramal Song is boring......and useless
I was sitting in jail when this came on the radio, I was like holy shit!??!
Apparently Eddie Guerrero isn’t dead……
I was probably the 646,527 th like💥💪
The only question i have is..... when is Fleas next role in a blockbuster movie? Lol.  How many have forgotten the Flea was Needles in Back To The Future? Lol.  Been awile, thats all im saying. Lol.
Guitar is the fav part of the song!!!!!
Capolavoro !!!
I was raised on this music and he's getting nothing but please don't stop!! Thank you Antony!.....fleas the shit!!!
the 90s are back <3

Once again the boys have put out another banger✊
Good Job Singing Anthony Kiedis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
E Flat, tune down half a step
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Russia 🇷🇺 love it)
We needed this. I hope there’s a reemergence of rock in general.
Wasn't digging the song till Fruciante's solo... nobody else can make a guitar sound like that.
agora sim caralho!
Black Summer is such a great track! Can't wait til the album is released! So good to hear new jams with John Frusciante playing with the band!
Respect from all people,! From Russia with love,!
Just heard this come on the radio for the first time and got a crazy Jethro Tull vibe, I dig it.
LEGENDS ARE BACK !!!
Прекрасно!
Wow I don't believe I'm missed it, John is back? Wow!!! 😍😍
Didn't know Will Ferrell was the drummer
노래 진짜 넘 좋다ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Still no shirt.... WTF Anthony😁
Motherfuckers YYYYYUS <3
RHCP 4 Ever, Legends
Nel 2022 in mezzo a tutto il trash e il bordello, avere ancora i Red Hot che suonano vale ORO. Ringrazio Dio ogni giorno per questo❤️
Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RHCP vuelve a su originalidad
Legal.
Magdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This is such a disappointing song especially being it the first John comeback *edit* I’m disappointed in Anthony’s absolute gibberish lyrics and heavily auto tuned signing. Great to see the boys tho. And their actual sound is still rhcp
John home. All will be fine now.
Best song ever
Ok, so...I already know I'm gonna wear this album out when it's released. Damn. Love RHCP!
For some reason this reminds me a lot to Castles Made of Sand and the Wind Cries Mary by Hendrix
Apart from him really enunciating his R's and sounding a little Irish at times, Anthony (and the band! JOHN!!!!!!), this is a fantastic song, I love it. Definitely Dani California vibes, it's so good. Can't wait for the album!
Goosebumps!! I’m delighted that you guys come back to whole-world fans.
Push on Guys Keep it Alive
지난 21년간 RHCP 음악을 들으며 변함없이 응원합니다.
sergio kun aguero
frusciante 😘😘😘😘
I would have listened without the video!! LOVE THIS!!
How is he about to turn 60?!?!
I am leather,  i fall .. ,,i say quit- he f×cks with me.  No? So..  not accepting- playing intermittent and afraid card? Not allowed Yes.. there's one sun that comes out legs- talk shit minions- you should have bided your time in quarantine better
$8 shipping on a $13 CD is ridiculous! Not gonna do it. I'll just download it from here
🌶🌶🌶🌶
Unbelieveable. They are close to 60 and still alive after all these chemicals...I don't remember when I've heard them the first time.Been so long...Keep it rolling
I was so inspired after watching this video that I went and woke up my 65 year old neighbor and we did like 2 hours of karate together until the sun came up
Fuck yeah, welcome back!
Powerful
Good to see Will Ferrell back in action!
Jesus name is most powerful name in the universe if you ask him for help you will be saved
Du pur red hot, le temp passe mais la musique est la même
first i didnt like this song much but later i told myself oh boy cmon its RHPC its JOHN now its my one of the fav song of 2022
John Frusciante looks kind of like John Wick in this video. I couldn't place it until just now. 😂. It's a compliment BTW.
This might be the worst thing I've ever heard and seen. holy fuck
Legendary band. Frusciante is just fucking unbelievable, playing rock solos in 2022 like it's nothing. I hear a bit of Cantrell in the first one and a bit of Cobain later on. Frusciante's guitar tone is somehow always fresh, while still letting that "clean" strat sound from another era shine through. It's just always full of soul, borrowing that rythmic freedom from Hendrix and never overplaying. Frusciante's guitar parts will be celebrated forever, the ones in this song are no exception.
I love you tony.
que mrd  la tiradera de jimmy sampedro es mejor
Уууууууууууууууууууу!
How am I just finding out about this over 30 days later
I did not know will Ferrell could play the drums like that 😂😂😂
I hope so happy for this album
⚫🌞❤
Will Ferrel must have talked Keanu Reeves into playing guitar........
John Frusciante is a cool dude.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
@1:52 is where it happens and at @2:50 and @3:08
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This a bad ass jam I love listen to red hot chili peppers
A essência de décadas ❤️
Damn bruh really struck a zyzz @2:50

Боже мой, какая поебень
I'm getting By the Way album mash up with Stadium vibes YWAHAHAH they BACK BOIS!!!!
I know you're blind But you gotta see this
Слава Украине ! и Хлопцам з Ред Хот Чилли Пепперс
What are these moves ma boy
Welkome Back Red hot Chili peppers!! Great song! Missed you!! Hope that 2022 have a Bright and Sunny Sumner instead of a black summer 🤟
Sounds like aqualong
A good song, but i still prefer the Blood Sugar and Uplift mofo...era. see the special below👇 https://youtu.be/KIAiPj8Ji0c
Naked as usual Hopi trait
Capolavoro
Grazie
<3 <3
Я хочу жить в их песнях!!!!
Revel!
1:52 spettacolare!!

Só eu quase choro quando vejo john de volta? Aff 🎶🎶❤
eu estive aqui quando lançou na esperança dessa banda voltar  red hot na veia 🤘🤘
Ух ты, я их еще молодыми помню) Крутые парни)
its hard to see...they look so old now..😭😭
This setup is better. This is how Chillyiiies should be :)
2:01 Don't know why can't help imagining Anthony being chased by nihilists.
Thank you RHCP for being at my musical side for the 35 years of my life. You’ve been one of the few constants and we love you guys.
I hope when Anthony is 80 and making music he’s shirtless and jamming out and looking better than most 30 year olds
Nice new song
i liked Anthony's melody more than anything in this one...and his little iconic dance lol
Drummer looks always like Will Ferrell
Long live the chilli peppers!!!!
"Oh, I love Led Zeppelin!!!" - Tom Holland
RHCP + Frusciante = 10 RHCP + Josh = 10  My dream:  RHCP  +  Frusciante  + Josh = 1000🤩
Iggy pop let himself go
Epic
There’s something cool about hearing Anthony actually pronounce the letter “R” when pronouncing words.  Aka summer not summa
It’s a shame YouTube won’t allow me to give this song two or more Likes
Didn't know John Wick plays for the Chilli Peppers!
Always a good day when a new RHCP track drops!😎👍
They  are brilliant musicians who have chemistry that is unparalleled. Chad and Flea are thee greatest rhythm/funk dynamos.. Anthony Kiedis is a masterful front man and lyricist,  but John Frusciante is from another dimension. When I saw him explain how he came up with his Californication riff listening to the Cure, and his profound idealism of his instrument it blew me away. I am an ex addict drummer who sees things a lot like John. He is Mozart Genius.
Damn this song is great
Missed you John. Welcome back
awesome
style ga berubah. denger intro aja udah ketahuan ini rhcp. great!!!!
Roots Rock & Reggae
It’s not RHCP without John… glad he’s back.
HELL YES!!  So glad you're back! This band has always brought mellowness to my chaotic life
RHCP abarcando con una impresionante y total sensibilidad, la actualidad mundial, incendios, pandemias, teorías, conspiraciones y la desconocida dirección a la que la humanidad está siendo guiada por un caballo sin cabeza. El regreso de John es siempre un valor superior a la enorme creatividad que la banda no deja de entregarnos a todos los seguidores desde sus primeras apariciones. Black Summer emociona desde el primer acorde, desarrolla, crece y cierra para convertirse en un clásico para siempre de la banda y de la música mundial. Como siempre el aporte inmejorable en la producción de Rick Rubin con su mítico estudio Shangri-La de Malibu.
Conservan su esencia y su estilo de música no para de sonar ufff.
No gimmicks. No change of style to try to appeal to a different audience. Just the same beautiful, unique, cool, RHCP sound.
More importantly - When did Will Ferrell start playing drums? 🤣
This just sounds like a lost B-side to a Stadium Arcadium single...and I love it.
Excelente trabalho!
DUDE JOHN IS BACK!!!! (nothing against josh, his solo in dark necessities was dope but like JOHN)
Yussssssssssss! Frusciante is back, baby!!
✌️💜
Sonzeira show, Red Hot tira onda, sensacional 🇧🇷🇺🇸🙏
This is good shit!!! Nothing today can compare to the chili peppers..  they are the greatest rock n roll band from 1990-present..  easily in my opinion
How this is so nice compared to all the bad rap that u hear on the radio. Thank u.
Los amo por siempre
Guys! This is charts material. Let's f*cking go!!!
omg John...
Anthony looks a bit like Daniel Day-Lewis w that entire hair/facial hair ensemble, it finally just hit me..and w that (?) accent. Edit: like one of his character roles, idk, just something that hit me after having already watched this a number of times. I dig this song! 🤘 Peace, love, light & good music 😊🍀
john frusciante killed river phoenix
I need more heroin in my life if its gonna make me look as good as Anthony does at his age.
It’s fitting the new album drops on my birthday :-) Awesome to see the Peps back at work!
They sound just the same, kudos! ( Unlike Coldplay who lost touch with their soul and lost their sound after their second album, I miss the early Coldplay)
Tremenda energia....TOP !
que solo fenomenal, incrivel
Viciada nessa música 🎵🎵🎵🎵
God this is so bad. Very disappointing as usual
love the accent added to the vocals.  He has an amazing voice and sounds like a Peaky Blinder!!! Bad ass
This song would perfectly fit in Californication. So glad they're back ❤️
I Love This Sounds Like A Lost Track From Stadium Arcadium . PErfcetion !!!
Waiting on another black summer to what?
Like always... They explote my heart! ❤️❤️🇧🇷🇦🇷
I pre order your new album in amazon on cassete, but they only mention track no.9 to 17 in the track listings there. Was that error or is it only track no.9 to 17 only that you're going to release on cassete?
wow justin long can sing now..
Fui cortar meu cabelo em casa durante pandemia agora que vi ta igual o do nosso querido Anthony.... chupa haters kkkkk
The Red Hot Chili Peppers STILL got it!! How many artists/bands can say they’ve written great hit songs in their unique style across 5 different decades?? They are amazing.
" John Frusciante "  i missed your rock guitar SOOOO much,  THANK YOU !!!!!
Good lord, PEPPERS making my life better - evern if the world is going through some deep shit, with RHCP sound it's all good
John Wick on guitar?
John is back!
I'm glad to see the old guitarist back
They got their groove back! Welcome back Johnsie and thank you on behalf of thousands!
2022  is the time where artists are trying to fight back the sadness and fear that have accumulated in the past two years. Thanks RHCP for this!
This is so grand.
--- A lazy rain am I , The skies refuse to cry  (Drought and low rain precipitation )  --- Cremation takes its piece of your supply  (Wild Fires are burning the vegetation we live on)  --- The night is dressed like noon  (Forrest fires at night  are so intense and bright as if it is noon time)  --- A sailor spoke too soon  (The state of the Enviroment and the sea Level rising )  --- And China's on the dark side of the moon (China has literally placed a rover on the dark side of the moon)>
Hellll Yeaaaahhh 🤘 again come to Istanbul / Turkey 😎🤘
Anthony looking kind of Keith richardsesque with those moves
nostalgic but seemingly relevant to our current reality....a beautiful mix of happiness and realism.
2:14 🎇
Anthony has this whole new accent that is just so amazing 👏
forever a hit 🤩😍
Wtf this is too good
His words are saying?
only ones who understand the power of music will understand this moment
John Kreese from Cobra Kai on Drums 😂
glad to see you guys still doing this amazing music,i believe this song never ever will played on the radio today, thanks the internet, rocks isn't dying yet!
When will release the new album?
man the band has had its ups and downs but this here is a song that showcases the overall talent that they always had and never let go stale. love this song .
Esta banda sigue haciéndome disfrutar tanto de su música, parece que no pasaran los años. 🤟🤎
every chili peper song is great
I need to meet all these men, shake their hands... then die happy...
They are back♥️
The members and musics never get old. ✌️
How awesome, welcome back
Rich carpinsky
The second Frusciante appears made my heart truly smile. Thank you so much.
Beauty style...Very Red Hot...
I making one project using this music.....
Made up my mind I want to die with one of there songs playing in the background love this band
Diego Verdaguer no ha muerto!!!!!
Great song. So much fun.
Anthony and Flea ( I met you flea hitchhiking) you should do a song and about Ukraine and invite Jack Black to sing and others ,..no ones helping them!!!
Essa banda já devia se aposentar....
My favourite new song of 2022. This could be Chili Peppers classic in years to come; has _By The Way_ and _Dani California_ vibes about it.
muy buen tema.exelente forma de presentar canciones divirtiéndose con canciones clásicas y componiendo a la vez..como dice John furciante grnio y Anthony con su voz genial..y así pasan los años y la banda no pierde su estilo..Red Hot.por siempre
what's with the Irish thing he's doing. Arr matey
The thing about RHCP is that they only have some good songs   They mostly have great ones.
John Fruciante a casa ? 😱♥️
Fire your hair dresser bruh
Nada nuevo...
THE MF 🐐
just a big band in the history, of universe thanks x compartir ✌🏻
They want to live forever. Going the right way.
chad's drums sound awesome, didn't sound that great on the getaway
Love it more each day :D
0:43 best moment
Nice verse, indifferent chorus, amazing soloing by big John.
These are the worst lyrics I’ve ever heard.
Cannot wait to see these guys again floor seats in Detroit baby
Have you actually read these lyrics?  My five year old could have wrote this rhyming crap
Bíblico
Its an amazing song
แค่เห็มมือกีต้ากลับมาก็...ดีใจ....ล่ะครับ....lol
thats not a music video thats just flea in his natural habbit
John frusciante my favourite guitaris  soul and sound its imagine
Салам из Алматы! PARANOID forever.....
Anthony looks like if that pencil-neck from the accounting department got bulked up to get revenge on the guy who humiliated him at the bar last year.
Ben Stiller with a moustache.  Such cringe.
So clever singing about COVID 🙏
dios
Watching John Back with RHCP is another level fun
It’s nostalgic Vintage Chilli Peppers
r.h.c.p this has always  kept  the pepper  vibe thank you r.h.c.p for your hard work for awesome  tunes ty
This song by RHCP reminds me of the '90s. I mean, BTS who?
the only band that stays true to their genre/self imo.
Foda pra caralho!
Z ✌
Might be one of the best solos ever. Makes me think about hendrix
These guys get better with age. Been a fan for 14 years. Hope they come to the uk, we need them after the last couple of years.
Widih.. Jhon is back🤘🤘
Have been listening to them since i was a teenager and they still rock
fantastic quartet, Frusciante the best, great to see this lineup back.
_🏃
Fuck mic drops... that 'mic stand' drop was smooth.(2:58) I love the chili's. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Happy to see John and all the gang together... Please keep us impressed with your unique band soul & sound. More importantly, RHCP to be one and united.
Pat Finnerty, paging Pat Finnerty.
Nobody gonna mention the autotune?
John frusciante is the most talented and coolest mf on the planet
Who else here thinks "The Great Apes" is going to be the best song on the new album?
Keanu Reeves on guitar
Not a big fan of them, but this song is another level of joy.. 😌
Happy Leif Erikson Day RHCP, Hinga Dinga Durgen
Basically sounds like a B-side from Stadium Arcadium.
Wow, it's amazing.         Ant went 87 seconds without taking his shirt off.
This is a good song and like the song Breaking the Girl sounds like a  cool modern version of a folk rock song
All I hear is “California is very California, please go to California and stay in California”
Os Melhores!! <3
They don't make bands like this no more...
How has Kedis become Irish suddenly? He sounds like Christy Moore!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tears. I’m just so happy to see John back on the guitar. With everything wrong in the world at least there is one thing that feels right. Can’t begin to explain how happy I am to see the four of them still staying true and being masters of music.
Music is for ever
Hell yes!!!
Anthony e seu jeito californiano de interpretar as músicas! Cada qual tem uma identidade própria, não são todas as bandas que são assim. Ótimo trabalho RHCP.
I been waiting on Frusciante and the guys to drop some new dope tracks! The wait is over  🙌
Royalitteraly love from https://youtube.com/channel/UCdzb0a4jjRBTnC06nyEmI9w
PROOF that the current of trends does not erode all. RHCP still stand true. Mad respect for these guys.
This is excellent. The four players back in synch. Amigos to the end.
They should definitely use this song in the opening scene of season 3 of the show black summer whenever they decide to make it
They sound just as good as ever,but what is up with Anthony looking like Napoleon Dynamites asshole uncle
💯💯💯💯💯💯👌👌👌👌👌👌
This song is as addictive as crack. It just lingers in my mind trying to figure out it's real meaning.
John run out of heroin money again?
can't wait for the new album!
check out my rhcp covers!
Who knew we'd have such a dark summer ahead?
Sheesh! that Guitar solo and that tone.
Thailand 🤘
I love RHCP. Nobodys like them.
Vibe massa demais, é disso que a gente gosta!
2022 and still one of the BEST bands of all time. They just keep getting better and better! Very few bands put on a live show like them!!!
Как всегда на высоте!!!!!!!!!
Awesome
There are only few things that make my soul soar like an eagle, Frusciante back in his natural habitat with RHCP is one of them.
Who knew Will Ferrell could play the drums...
деды зажигают, интересный клип вышел
This song was destined for the playlist I assembled: " Nick Fuentes White Boy Winter Playlist " on YOUTUBE
I hope justin long kicks the habit soon he looks fucken 50something here
This video feel like they returned from a music journey to enlighten the world. 😂
give Chad something to do man....just played the same beat the whole fucking song with minimal fills and crashes...boring. Decent hook and catchy enough song.
this song has to get millions of likes john frusante it's good that you're back
Frusciante got the same signals with Hendrix from 'The Spirit Bank of Universe'
Amazing
Brilliant, as usual.
YES YES YES
That voice...
Énorme. Du simple, du classique, de l'intemporel, du red hot, simplement du red hot comme j'aime 🇺🇸❤️🤘❤️🇨🇵
Welcome back love
The good old sound is intact . Is this from the new album ?
Welcome Back John! We have missed you
Please get rid of the Freddie Mercury mustache.
what the fuck lol
THERE BACK HE'LL YA !!!!!
Fuck he's back!!!!!!!! The world is right again good to see them together. 🧚🏻‍♀
Flea is a top 5 bassist of all time
Perfect soft sound and emotional embodiment
Ah shit John Frusciante is back hell yeah
Arrrr Matey Anthony!
good to have you back frusciante!
Something tells me this will be the theme song for summer 2024. Get to training fellas
Look at John Frusciante in this video. Right where we left him 20 years ago. DeepFake technology has just gotten so good.
Great song love their music.
So glad I found this
RHCP @ their finest
the way he still dances like his body is tryna speak for itself 🥺💞
Global warming. That's my take of the lyrics.
Los amo son los mejores !!!!
Buena la cancion del fortnite
holy shit i didnt know will ferrel was in this band
22M views no dislikes!!!!
Great song!!! The best of Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!
Miss old Peppers
Maybe it's time to put the shirt back on 🤪🤣😅💟
Flea is the energy, John is the soul, Anthony is the voice and Chad is the beating heart. *Red Hot Chili Peppers 4ever*
My roomate committed suicide the day before this was released. He listen to like 4 things and RHCP was one. This song will always remind me of the beautiful relationship me and my boy cj had. He really was one of my best friends. I cry when I hear this song. 😢 I know he'd love it. Keep it going yakl this is grade A stuff. Forever running through my mind
Hey Russia,  Уважаемые россияне, ваши СМИ подвергаются цензуре. Кремль лжет. Тысячи ваших солдат и украинских братьев гибнут на Украине. Узнайте правду в свободном Интернете и в приложении Telegram. Время свергнуть диктатора Путина!
At last ‘ a band’ again. So tired of morose singer songwriters recently
Never miss the concert 20 years ago in Dresden. Even when we were not fully there, after our tour trough this City. Miss you
I swear that guitarist is in and out of RHCP alot
One more album after UNLIMITED LOVE please!!
<3
So damn glad John is back!!
Rede hot or die
Finally a great new song from the Peppers with  the old vibes and of course the comback of John is the reason
1:27 and the shirt is off. Classic RHCP….
Those drums sound great
I wanted to type in my comment how I feel that - even though I am not a big fan of the band -  I admire how they simply hit the switch and their 100% trademark vibe is back immediately. And that moment I see that hundreds of you guys had that same feeling and expressed the same thing...
Great song. At first I thought Anthony's phrasing on the verses was a little weird, but now I dig it. Frusciante's tone on the solo is so good - reminds me of a cleaner-sounding Jimi Hendrix or a more psychedelic Slash.
Yeah . John back on track . The guitar sound is just heavenly
Even feels like a classic Chili peppers video!
Feels like classic chili peppers 😁
This is art. I love Red Hot Chili Peppers. From Bogotá, Colombia
They still got it ! Keep up the work boys ! 🤙🏻
the amazing part is read the comments and see that are all nations together to hear such a great music
1:52 John Frusciante ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Red Hot com o John ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's amazing how well they play together how original they are after all this years.I love the song ❤️
It's ok.  Dig Frusciante's parts.  The verse vocal is bad.  How it's delivered, how it's recorded.... don't like it at all.  The chorus is alright.  All together it's cool....John doing his Hendrix stuff, band sounds good.  Mostly just hate the verse vocals.
John Wick, killer Also John Wick: RHCP Guitarrist
big tune from Senegal- West  Africa
Im convinced he is Iggy Pops long lost son.
If you with RHCP, you’ll love this and more https://youtu.be/SGOR4NysRpA
Eu sei... Eu sei que não é a sua primeira vez aqui
Happy Birthday to John Frusciante 💕
They are back!
อย่างจ๊าบ🤘
Great Song! like Antirana-Jordan23!!
I came here for Frusciante
Every time John rejoins the band, They shit gold.. Coincidence 🤔
johnnyyyyyy💛💛
Demo song, nothing special
Love This Band!
Wow I love them still to this day, but Anthony needs to lose that mustache
I feel like I need to hop on a pirate ship and steal some treasure…love this new single
Don't like whatever it is Anthony is trying to do with his voice here. Unless he recently had a stroke, I hope it won't be a tactic he tries again.
พริกเผ็ดๆ
Its march 6,2022 and still at there Best....RHCP
Legend says that anthony's alergic to shirt 👕
Is that WILL FERRELL on the drums?
This is shit - leave it where it was.
That’s amazing! Total early 2000s vibes!
Quem comigo hoje e sempre!
It’s nice to hear John again
😍
Good to see Anthony k. Enjoying his days as a pirate now. Good stuff
Eu amo o Frusciante demaaaaais, serio to muito feliz com isso
😍😍😍😍
As with all Chili Peppers vids, I was just counting the seconds till the shirt comes off! In all seriousness though, that was awesome! I can tell this is one that's gonna keep growing on me with each listen. Anthony's accent is a bit different, and that Frusciante solo...that was surprisingly extensive and completely rocked! 🤘
RHCP for my go-to Summer groove in March❤️ or any old time!!
Another crap anthem song . Red Necks   https://youtu.be/-5qhNRmMilI
These guys don't age a minute
funkyartpunkrock
Is that Will Ferrell on drums?
Like the song, but not the autotune on Anthony.
Es una canción totalmente perfecta, que melodia 🥰
This is real magic.  Not kidding.
Não me faz muito sentido a relação do verso com o refrão, parece duas músicas diferentes colocadas  dentro de uma.   Quanto aos arranjos é excelente. Tanto o mini solo do Frusciante no início da canção quanto a linha de baixo do flea no final
Wow!  the band spent so much time out of the music scene that I thought they were going to come back with a TOP sound, instead they lost all the essence of the style that consecrated them in the rock world.  that's sad!
Perfect for the playlist I assembled: " Nick Fuentes White Boy Winter Playlist " on YOUTUBE
Eu amo a música deles são muito foda parabéns red hot❤❤👏👏
nuclear details
This song does not make any sense
I want to take my son Daniel Hummingbird-and enjoy your music in person@
Same drum beat as Californication
Feliz cumpleaños John 🎂🎈 como haces gritar de la emoción a la guitarra!! Muchos años más maestro
🥀🥀🥀🥀
FINALLY John Frusciante has come home!!
In a way I can hear Jethro Tull in this song.  Incredbile good band.
Welcome back John Frusciante. No disrespect to other guitar player but John has just got a special sound and vibe that drives this band, Great tune
this song spoke to me! 😳😳
John is back, that's it!
2:11 Dabbed
👍👍👍
California........
You instantly know its a good song, magical rich tones of RHCP
Wow the tiger king with another killer song! Can't wait for the carol baskin diss track now
happy birthday John
It's just Red Hot Chilli Peppers, <3
YESSSS!!! Frusciante is back!
Mother of God I can't believe I'd live to see the day John is in a new video. I love this song, very raw.
Save the children - close the sky over Ukraine https://youtu.be/t2S_FMJlpdI https://youtu.be/t2S_FMJlpdI https://youtu.be/3yQBtnzS9XM
Look y’all the 3  🌅 wake up 🔝
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Straight fire as always😎
Loving the new track from Joe Exotic :)
Джон!!!!!!!!!
Frusciante is different level, the min he picks that guitar back up the chili's are back 🙌
Frusciante is back. That distinctive sound that he brings to the band with his guitar is very unique. Love the song.
Soooooo glad these guys don't change..... beautifully made hits....always
Gold!!!
Sonoramente todo esta maravilloso, pero visualmente no pude ponerle atención a la rola por ese vigotazo y baile hinoptisante de anthony!!

Old cold moldy peckers
his is the beginning of their downfall 👎↘
How do people still like this band ugh
We missed you, thanks for coming back <3
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Amazing
Tight groove, chemistry showing four brothers’ love, rock solid rhythm bed, goofy faces from Flea, Frusciante pyrotechnics, whipcrack drumming from Chad, Kiedis charisma, dopey lyrics… the Chili Peppers are back.
Masuknya john membawa RHCP lebih bernyawa lagi
Poster Child is out! 🔥
don't forget to support RHCP and JF on spotify!
I cannot stop listening this masterpiece✨✨
Lunghel sah ah aw Karen... Nabol hoi uhve
I’ll take frusciantes playing over shredders any day. Soul is much harder than technical playing.
They are back!
They are back. Best song for the last 10 years
Is this nuclear war prediction on summer?
Is John back??
Those Frusciante sounds are back😍
Il never forget introducing the Red Hot Chili Peppers to everyone I met. To friends or acquaintances at school, cousins, and siblings. In middle school one day at a long lunch table, guys and girls scattered, some one brought up best bands and each was saying their own. When it was my turn, I mentioned the Red Hots being my favorite band of all time when everyone was into scene emo punk rock at the time (2006). They all looked at me like I was completely nuts, then laughed at me. They all said "who's that ??" And I felt embarrassed at the time. Needless to say, each one of those is now a diehard RHCP fan. 2 of my exes then became huge fans too . Lol Never forget when Irvin Showed you the Chili Peppers. 😉
Immortali.
Happy birthday John!  Good to see you again in the band!
Me emocionó bastante por la guitarra de John con los red Hot de nuevo  Todo suena tan homogéneo pero al mismo tiempo se nota su contribución individual cada uno poniendo de su esencia
FC จาก ไทยแลนด์ 🇹🇭  I Love you สมกับการรอคอย การกลับมา เป็น Red Hot Chili Peppers อีกครั้ง 🤟🏻🤘🏻
Only heard one of they're songs,but this shit slaps
Frusciante ♥️
Aguante los red hot lo mejor de lo mejor!!!! Desde Argentina
Ditch the goofy 'stache,  Anthony..
😻😻😻👏🏼👏🏼
It´s not better music from RHCP,  but the guy´s vibe is so good.
GRAMMYS
SLOW CHEETAH VIBES 🤘
I know the Chad Smith looks like Will Farrell comparisons have been done a lot but now Anthony Kiedis is starting to look like Ben Stiller's long lost twin brother.
I just hope this is not the best song of the album
Finally.
And they did it again !
When did Anthony start trying to sound Irish?
This has a slow cheetah's vibe
Other than the chorus... I'm getting nuclear war vibes (listen to it again... with lyrics). That's my interpretation anyway. 👁❤🔴🥵🌶
¡Volvió el rock!
POSTER CHILD IS OUT! DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THEM!
SUPPORT RHCP ON SPOTIFY AND ITUNES!
Not really it takes john 2 b with these 3 2 make a perfect 4 they are musically compatible it's easy for them it's born it grows and lives rhcp
Baita Música! Que som da hora!
Disappointing song
red hot fez parte da minha juventude anos noventa inesquecíveis
Isn't it amazing when you search for these guys, and happen across thier latest music..  I kept listening, and listening and listening... 🤔🎂
This song has it all: the pitch of Anthony is so in shape like his muscles, the silky bass lines of flea, chad is so sick on drums...and hell yeah FRUSCIATE IS BACK!!! I love his fuzzy tone.  It's unbelievable how, after almost 40 years, they are so fresh, not a re-heated soup only to make some million in the 4.0 music industry. Please RHCP make music great again!
CPS ZL SP BR NI
Perfect !
Slavia Ukrainie Putin go hell
Am i the only one who thinks anthony shut up i want to hear frusciante and flea😅
still number one on my list
Cara essa música é muito foda, a banda continua em um alto nível. Parabéns rapaziada
Sucesso Total Show😎😎💥💥
It’s been a long time good to have the rhcp back again
Não sei explicar o amor, eu só sei sentir. RHCP pra sempre ❤️
Que nostalgia los red los amo
Great track. So happy that John is back in the band. I loved josh and their output with him but this song has such an old school chili peppers feel
Eu sempre escutei mais o Green Day do que eles, acho que eles deveriam dar uma olhada nessa música e ver o que é lançar músicas novas sem perder a raíz, Infelizmente pra mim Father of All... Não colou, até hoje eu ainda não engoli esse música deles... É isso
i must admit, i liked what klinghoffer brought to the band, but as a 35 yr RHCP fan, i now feel as though the band is whole again and this is vintage RHCP.  thank you Frusciante for getting urself together and coming back
Flea eu te amo Flea! ❤️
i was there
Funziona veramente bene
This reminds me of my all time favourite "Californication" can`t wait to get my hands on that album! ❤
Life long fan of the pepps… but this isn’t the best. Lest be honest
Fucking dope
This song is at the legendary level. Same level as Californication, Scar Tissue, among others...
My god… (I’m an atheist) I love John.
olds but golds
11/10
Can’t stop listening, it’s awesome! You are like a good wine, guys! Every year become better and better. Love you 😘❤️
This is awesome! So glad yall are making new music for us! Cheers
Uh, um, I listened to this once and went like... Hold up, I didn't get the lyrics at all. So I listened again while reading lyrics. I understand all the words, but it doesn't make any sense to me anyway T__T Yaay for not being a native English speaker. Can any enlightened soul explain the lyrics to me?

1:13 Will Ferrell is killing it on the drums -only one complaint: needs more cowbell!
excelente interpretación

Genios totales!
🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒
It does sound a bit more grungy, but still connected to their essence, Great job
🤘🔥🌶
Anthony Kiedis still looks as rapey as ever. A real rapey pirate.
Nuclear war is already on the doorstep of every home! If Russia is not stopped now, every family will experience terrible consequences in the future
Nuclear war is already on the doorstep of every home! If Russia is not stopped now, every family will experience terrible consequences in the future

John is back. Yes!!
Absolute banger
groovy
As a former butt wiper I just really needed this song thanks hot chilli red peppers derk side of the moon bro
Welcome back the best guitar sound and play by John. Thank you so much ✊
Vem pro Brasiiiiiiiillllllll
💜💜💜 my favorite band
John Frusciante is so good. So happy hes back! RHCP Forever!
you can always tell when Rubin is producing, it brings the whole album and sound a notch up.
1 minute and 27 seconds.... Anthony tried his best wearing his chest covered
Stable sex offender mustache that Anthony Kiedis wears under his nose...:D props and greetz for Mr. muusty his band and the fat song...peace:)
its nice to see the band still keeping their sound intact
14 0 ( 0 ) 1
It's good, not funky enough for me tho like their old stuff
funny i never was a big dan i liked give it away, and the album Californiation  this is actually pretty good typical RHCP imo
Aaaaahh yes.....this is the sound that's been missing.....loved Josh but this band is best with john
Meh. At least they have Jake Gyllenhaal back on guitar
Looks like a younger ❤️❤️
I love you RHCP ❤️
No matter the insanity of the planet these guys remain in there unique selves tapping into the creativity of the universe.
это охуенно.
Been hearing this on the radio recently. Idk what this says about the music but I presumed this was a Metallica inspired band that just started out. Had no idea until just now, weeks of hearing it and deciding to look it up, that I realize it is RHCP.  Still a good song none the less. I enjoyed whenever it did come on the radio.
WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE AND LISTEN RHCP. PLEASE COME TO PERÚ!! 🇵🇪🇵🇪
This song will Never leave my head! It’s Pure Perfection. This album is going to be Legendary. I’m a RHCP Fan for Life.
To me, RCHP get better as they keep going on. I wasn’t a fan of them until the early 2000’s, and since then I’ve enjoyed all the albums they have released in that time.
Josh Klinghoffer is cool, I appreciate his work with John and RHCP, but 0:45 is great to see
Welcome back john and please don't go again
Bang
☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
This song slaps
Love that solo, so minimal yet effective, and I like the use of the univibe too, kind of fitting for the nostalgic feelings this song conjures up. Keep rocking boys, glad you made it past some hard times and arose like Phoenixes from the fire.
i just wanna say that i'm so happy that john is back, my original rhcp is back, woooohoooo!!
Let’s show them what Gen X is about
Hope to see the peppers on June 2022! I’m from the Galápagos Islands (small and far place) hope the war do not get worst and Euro-tour is still available, this will be a dream come true!
I've been waitin'... I've been waitin'... Waitin' on another new red hot chili peppers album!
what will we do with a drunken sailor, earli in the mornin
Has anyone commented on the Irish had "R" sound Anthony is doing? I actually laughed when I heard him singing this song.
So awesome to hear frusciante's guitar again. What a legend!
Mossss que música boa, tá doido! Não erram nunca, amo muito 🥰
That chorus tho 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I cry proud listen this song
A little better than Justin Beiber
Always RHCP
actually nice song
My science teacher who is obsessed with this band hasn't been shutting up about this song so if figured Id check it out, it's kinda bop ngl
So, Frusciante can stop time and avoid aging... Cool.
Definitely a political song but I love it "waiting for another black summer to end"
As a writer and musicians so fucking happy to see em all together again.. I knew it was a new rhcp cuz the hairs on my arm stood up as all their individual signature sounds  mixed in to make one raw emotion ..I couldn't help but get a chub and jerk it with tears of fucking joy ... ..thank you for the years of ear art and dig my song 🎵 on SoundCloud dope fish - devil in an angels mask ..thank you and God speed all
TEMÓN
I've been waiting on John Frusciante to return to this band!!!
?!
No shit will ferrel is there drummer
Why does your drummer look like will ferrel?
Parece àqueles clipes antigao
hear me now
Cade a musica nova???????????
I don't know how Anthony Kiedis does to be so fit and younger than two years ago. He is a true frontman! I like so much his movements in the scene of the rock, very ascethics and modern in this video. Here is as never before. Better! Congrats! Allof them are stunning, of course
Muito.boa🏭
MEU DEUS SENHOR OBRIGADO POR ESSE HINO!!!!! DEPOIS DE 5 ANOS!!!!
Chili peppers are back, Tears for Fears have new material, Russia again…it’s the 80s all over  again!
Is it just me or is everyone with me........ keep coming back to this! 🙏☮️🙏❤️
Great song yeaaaahhhhhhhhh
I dont like his affected vocals in the beginning of the song.
holly shit 21M views !! in 3 weeks ?
They’re back 🔥🔥🔥
Probably one of their top 5 best songs
Flea
Thank you guys for bringing back the last wonder of the world. It sounds like I'm 20 years younger.
Will Ferrell crushing it on the drums
thank god chad is being chad. thank god anthony still works out. thank god john is back. someone please take away flea's poncho ! <3
God Anthony is pretty as always😭😭😭😭😭👍
Still got that early 90's sound!
John Wick sounds absolutely amazing on guitar!
Anthony Kiedis look like MACCIO CAPATONDA

"Platypus are a few / the secret life of roo." Exactly.
vocal vive no formol so pode
I'm 42 and it just feels so awesome to hear the Chili Peppers back at it like in all their glory like the days of old!
Anthony looks like the brother from Napoleon Dynamite, except you know, like being 60 years old.
not bad but i still miss the 80s funky songs so much
🔥🧡🔥🧡🔥🧡🔥🧡
they're back.. and they slap.
Retomando su verdadero estilo. 😍😍😍
1:52
wow! appreciation
It is SO damn good to see John back with the boys!
Thank you guys. I'm so happy for John. He's back to our hearts.I can't wait to listen to more songs and see you in Peru 🤩🇵🇪
This song brings me back in time!
anthony never looked better - I mean his body,.. not his stomache ;)
Looking ripped Anthony!
At last John Frusciante is back where he belongs. The Chili Peppers aren't the same without his input. Great tune, I can't wait for the album.
Been listening to these guys practically all my life…the changes we all went through on this wet rock floating through 1”s and the 0’s of the vast dimensional plains of of star dust and ether
Dies in water
I think they've found their niche. You can sing along dance to it.  They've never sounded better. And I'll be there in Manchester to see them. So happy frusciante is back xx
Probably the only band which has been delivering great songs throughout its entire career without losing in quality.
One of the only bands to stick to their style and haven't faltered since their debut
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
THANK GOD YOU'RE BACK
The gang's back!!
My cat listened to this song. Now it's a tiger.
Why do the lyrics seem like spy codewords
"Samalama senemena skippity bup bupta" ~ Red Hot Chili Peppers
I really like this song but... what's the 'derk side of the moon'?
Love the bassline, this song has been stuck in my head since I first heard it on the radio, and thought "Holy crap, RHCP put out a new piece of goddamn ART!".
동양무술 + 캘리포니아락
John wick???
Selamat datang kembali legenda🖤
Im so Happy that John is back but Josh was good as well!!
So happy John is Back
DKTT BURADAYDI.
Feels like home..
Wow good to see you guys again long live rhcp I really love your videos and one of yours videos is my inspiration 😍😍❤✌
Wow they still rock and roll they are in another level 😍😍😍❤
Thank guys!! happy to see the touch with John 🙏
BAHAHAHA! WTF was that? This came to me as an ad on another video. For the first 30 seconds I thought it was a joke parody ad for something like Cobra Kai. Then it slowly set in that it wasn’t intended to be a joke. This is like if a has-been rocker’s midlife crisis became a music video.
Nothing has changed  🎸❤️ 👌
my God
another great video
Lyrical genius - absolutely amazing.  This song really captures our latest days. Well done guys!
Will Ferrell is a great drummer.
I feel like this song is about COVID. I like the inclusion of China and censorship. First time I heard it on the radio I felt sad/happy at the same time. I like it!
The old stuff is much much better than this stuff
A black summer is your so called life when shadows are taller than soul. Then the night is dressed like noon.
Flea eats painbrush popsicles.
love from malaysian..
https://youtu.be/PsgltNEaOJM
It's good to see Will Ferrell has found a new hobby. Drums are cool
Nice rhcp Easy listening
Unremarkable Edit: other than to say “ unremarkable “
not sure if this is "as good", but it is definitely more RHCP than previous new releases.    or,  maybe im like everyone and just glad to see our boys still being themselves.
Amazing. Great music I love the band all of their music is beautiful.
The solo does not dissapoint as usual.
FRUSCIANTE FOREVER ❤️❤️
FUCK YES!!! This is just what the world needs right now, new Chili’s! Some sunshine in dark times. Can’t wait for the other 16 tracks!
Flea also looks like a sekiro boss
Anthony look like a sekiro boss
Joe Exotic called... he wants his hair cut back.  Sick bass ❤
Welcome back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Am I going to the bad place?
Thats not the summer song... sorry :(
Anthony looks like Joe exotic after he gets ripped in prison for 20 years,  but man this is a killer song.
red hot chili peppers have no age..I love you Anthony ,John, flee, and Chad
No more great bands after the 80's and 90's. Its sad.... but at least i got to live through a lot of it.
I love red hot chili peppers till I breathe becoz' they are in my soul..my jhon is back .. the best guitarist of the universe
I always confuse the guitar from the beginning with Jimi Hendrix! 🤦 It's so good.
I hope the lyrics and the video are not a prophecy of what's to come...
this really makes you realize how shit today's pop music is.  RHCP comes out with a jam like this and just shames all.    love it
Jimi Hendrix is back?
They still got it
It really shows that John is the one playing the guitar
Not great. Hope the album is okay.
John is back and all is right again.
Welcome back California Rock n Roll. Long live the Chili Peppers!!!
Anthony never fails to coin a new phrase, it’s actually crazy impressive   “sailing on a censorship”
Mullet strikes back...
Love the song :) It sounds like something out of their Californication time, but better sounding. Bring on the Unlimited Love!
Looks like Will Ferrell is on the drums
I’m sorry but why does Anthony sound like that? He sounds like he’s trying to imitate a pirate?
Why does he sound Irish/like a pirate 😂
Can someone please explain why Anthony suddenly has a ridiculous accent?
Increíble, temazo.
Serait-ce le morceau de la fin du monde ?
Pure juice of RHCP. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM
sigh
Без RHCP невозможно жить на полную. Это, как воздух..Without them, it is impossible to live to the fullest. It is like air.
Non ne sbagliano una... Li adoro 🔝🎸🎸🎸
Anthony I love youuu ❤️
People from China watching this 😔
Ни чо си ещё пишут песни , крутяг
Só cool.   <3
Anthony Keidis is still ripped at 60.
Pure Red Hot!!!
Uncle Anthony: How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?... Yeah... Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would've been state champions. No doubt. No doubt in my mind.
Just heard this for the 1st time and already love it can't wait for the next album.
Can I put double thumb up?
Check out my cover of readymade here:  https://youtu.be/ts1Iaxb4wFM
The solo of jhon is hot
i love going to stars
Wait a second. Is that WILL FERRELL on drums?! 🥁
0:49 sou fã de mais desse cara, fico muito feliz de ver ele de volta com mais trabalhos nao canso de ver esse clip
Great song, but it’s nearly impossible for these guys to even come close to duplicating the sounds of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. That will always be their defining sound.
who says he is a bad singer? what about things and hypotheses for nothing... in the end, the most important thing is the music itself!
This composing full enjoyment 🔥😌 . Let's see How many views will this song get before 2023? What do you think comment me?
great band but have to be some of the ugliest band members alive.
I first discovered the chilli peppers back in highschool with the Californication album... Then I started to back track and hear their earlier work... Stadium Arcadium has helped me through some rough times and I can't wait to create new memories with this new album...🤘❤️
After 6 years this hits just right
Hot damn, another banger of a tune. Keep on rocking you guys! Can't wait to hear the album.
The more I listen the better  and better it gets...
When did Will Ferrell join Red Hot Chilli Peppers?
Obsessedddddd
🇧🇷🌎🙏
Groovy
This band just gets worse. Looks like they’ve swapped the H for meth now. Cool.
This is awesome!!!
Chad in his painter's suit. John in his flannel. Flea being Flea. And Tony in something new. All is right with the world.
🖤
Thx god!!!!!!!
YES!! I've been waiting for new music from them. They never disappoint! LOVEEE this band!!
John! That's the comment.
Let’s balance these positive comments with: That mustache is horrible.
Hey elon....a sea shanty..
Gosse bumbs to see frusciante there.
Been a fan for 36 years im 52.so many memories attached to the RHCP music!!!
Everyone's hyped for John's solo. Let me tell you that the guitar at the beginning of the outro gave me chills. That's when you know that the chilis are back.
แม่งเอาวะ
As a joke.... 9/10 I didn't hear a single mention about California
Oooh my god. I've just heard that MASTERPIECE. it's a new era and yet it isn't. More mature than ever and yet the same old sound. Goosebumps and chilling with Frusciante's solo I'm listening to RHCP since late 90s when I was 12yo and each and everytime they release a new song or music, it's just a gift! 🎧🎵🎶🎶
I am such a sucker. These lyrics really don't make any sense. And I don't care, as long as John Frusciante's guitar is back in the band. I am hooked that easily. Lol!
Saludos amigo desde Argentina
ok🙃
So catchy
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The solo directly from the vault of Hendrix
Got the ad didn’t skip😎🥸
You may not like Americans,but our music is forever
Keep it coming
Di mo kami maloloko Latino Heat (Eddie Guerrero) 🤣
🤟
That Will Ferrell is a beast on percussion.
Joder pero que hermoso simplemente hermoso
Beautiful song 😃🔥🔥🔥
This song is absolute.  It's like being clean and feeling the effects of a drug.  The chemistry in the band is right on
How well does Keanu Reeves play the guitar
RHCP por siempre.
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK! 😎
Finally RHCP has bad ass guitar again.
Boring.
Man, they sound so much better with Frusciante on guitar!  So stoked he’s back!!
they still ahve it. damn
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
I am waiting for the end of the black spring in Ukraine.
Melhor banda para sempre!!!!
It took a few times but this song has grown on me something fierce. I've liked RHCP for years but didn't consider myself an actual fan until the getaway album. I still can listen to that one front to back and if black summer is any indication, I'm gonna dig the new album hard
The last the best.
Amazing… just Amazing!!! The esence is still there!!!   😀
What they need to do is hang it up or evolve cause now it's just poor parodies of past songs. This song sounds like it was written by filthy rich old guys. The guitar solo destroyed everything else cause it was different
Obrigado por retornarem, vocês 4 são feitos um para os outros, vocês são simplesmente indiscutíveis, que venham os ao vivos, quero ver Dark Necessities Live com o John
I love it! RHCP 4 eveeeeeeer!!!
I can’t stop watching 🤩 I went to the Stadium Arcadium tour when I was like 18 and it was so amazing. I wore their CDs out they got me through those tough teen years. I am so happy their back and with John no less! makes my soul smile. I think I’ll watch the original Point Break as tribute tonight lol
Not much lookers these fellas
1:51 ... THAT timestamp we all want to see high up here. I need a 1 hour Solo loop now.
Favorite band for life
Heard it on the radio yesterday and thought it was from an older album. Just found out its brand new. LOVE the song.
John is BACK!!!!
These guys have always been so effortlessly cool. I'm so excited for this song and future releases ❤️
los amo tanto
I miss the days when bands named themselves after food. The Smashing Pumpkins Korn Limp Bizkit
Love the apocalypse laminate floor too.
I’m so excited for this album! It’s about to help me get through these hard times. Time to jam out !!!
The skies refuse to cry. Best line.
Niente...non ce la fa proprio a tenersi la camicia...but I' ve loved RHCP since forever and always will.
за гитарой к ZZ Top
WHO ELSE IS READY FOR THEIR WORLD TOUR WITH JOHN BACK IN THE GANG?!?!
The God John is back!!!
i have like all their songs memorized and I'm going to their concert in Detroit in August and I'm soooo excited
Bravissimi. Il ritornello lo avrei proseguito più su la linea della strofa ma bravi .
We love you Guys … Colombia !!!!!!
Anthony Kiedis should come out with some workout videos, I'd love to do one lol!
The more I hear this song, the more I love it. Fan since mid 80s and musically this is just perfection. A perfect flow of old school and new school CP. Sublime guitar hook at beginning that keeps my hips moving through. Fucking brilliant. People constantly ask me what my favorite CP song is and for more than 35 years I respond the same way...the last one I heard! Nothing but love here.
Eddie Guerrero and his magic mullet, LIVES!
Music is his religion, and it's pure. Thats the best explanation I have.
When Frusciante appears, remains me that part when he was a young boy in Under the Bridge video, but now in modern times
Привет Вам от Неприкасаемых😎
Не стареют душой ветераны....😃
who the fuck said rock is dead? this 4 men are back and keep rockin hard. just listen to that guitar solo is amazing 🤘
Song just in time. Real black summer waiting for me (Im from Ukraine btw)
John Frusciante is back with the RHCP...All is right again...
Da hora ... já escutei não sei quantas vezes.
This summers sky will be black.
Ben tornato John👍🌶🌶
Nice to see will Ferrell still got it lol
Sound of life
muito foda essa musica sou fa da banda pprt (papo reto)
Why the horrendous hair and mustache
Keanu Reeves na guitarra foi uma ótima escolha
the peppers are back
Yes this is exactly what we need, bring this lovely music back including these music videos!
RHCP FOREVER!!!
Come to Peru!!
I can't express how delighted I am to see John back in the band making beautiful music again.  In a way I feel like I always kind of knew it would happen on a soul level just because of the reality transcending magic that happens when these 4 play together.  John has been the greatest singular influence on my playing and general attitude towards making music.  I've followed his career since day one and he never ceases to both challenge and inspire me.   Much love to all of you wherever you are.  I'm glad we get to share a love of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and that they're back in the saddle!  Peace and love from Canada, Form and Chaos
Age is just a number
Holy shit Will Ferrell and Keanu Reeves in the Chili Peppers. Whose next?
THE GOOD OLD PEPPERS DONT LOSE THEM HOTNESS...!

Anthony Kiedis is so Anthony Kiedis in this video.

The Peppers have such an awesome, distinct sound. It never gets old. ❤
Quem veio por causa do vídeo do FunkyBlackcat ???
Bon sang que c'est bon !
NOW I WANT TO BE YOUR DOG 2022
So happy to see john cameback 🎉🎉 I listen to your music since 11 now 34 how amazing 23 years fans
Uraaa....!!! Uraaa....!!! ✋  God blessed russians army☝️ Peace it is finished war.
"Aquatic Mouth Dance" will be a monster jam
Fruscianteeeeeeeee  ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️  Finally!!! 😀😃🙂🙃
its been so much years and red hot chilli peppers are still so good
Marvelous solo
Flea with a mexican poncho ya babyyyyy
Most bands get washed up not this one it stays new top charts Awesome!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Miód ma moje serce 😙
It's like a 70s psychedelic sea shanty! Like this one
My Idol is back :D
Takes me right back to Blood Sugar Sex Magic. I like it.
I am probably responsible for 1000 of these views.  In a loop for over 3 weeks.  Yeah, I am obsessed.  Awesome song, and can't wait for the album release.
I was hoping 4 velvet glove evolved I believe I got a wish ☆
I am crying watching this. I recognized Flea's bass right away and then John's 62 Strat....this sounds like them, they move like they used to, it's just....right. i love it! I wish I could have afforded tickets to see them, but Ticketmaster fees are criminal.
I heard John records his guitar parts sitting on the floor. I can lend him a chair to use, if needed.
Damn, still in good shape!!
Simplemente impresionante 🤟🏼✨
Son tan originales... esta nueva canción siento que me lleva a mi adolescencia. Intactos!!!
John Frusciante...Josh is so good but John is the best.
Anthony getting haircut tips from Raised By Wolves……?
01:50 thank me later
Jon Bernthal,  Keanu Reeves and Will Farrel have a band??
You can always tell when John is back with the band.  Their music while always great goes to another level with him.
Trip back to 1990s alternative music era
RHCP is not just a band. They are a way of life and as corny as this sounds i really mean it. They follow you through every phase of your life. RHCP is a family and you become a part of it the moment you let them into your heart. Thats why they dont have to be perfect because non of us is.
La misma formula de siempre, te banco frusciante pero ojala algún día vuelva navarro y los despercuda como en el one hot minute.
Anthony "Kung fu" Kiedis  🤔
Sweet
Yep. Nuclear war confirmed.
This is a great song but he dances like my dad
Por siempre Los Red Hot ,hace 30 años que los escucho y los escucharé hasta la eternidad !!! Maravilloso y Unico  Frusciante  !!!

I love the part 0:44 - 0:55, that uni-vibey sound and those double stop licks are definitely a wink to Hendrix
Does Keidis think he's Irish now? What's with the accent? These guys have bugged me with everything they've done since Californication. Everything sounds like a watered-down regurgitation of something else they've done, yet they're still likely technically the best band in the world. Flea, and Chad are the best in the world at their instruments, and Fruciante is way the hell up there. This song sounds like virtually any of their songs on "Stadium Arcaneum" which sounded a lot like the sissy parts of Californication songs, which sounded like SPAM hybrids of everything else they've done, but honestly was still pretty damn good. I liked "Dark Necessities" quite a bit until I got the album which was boring as hell, and likely only listened to 5 times. This song could be good if they did the loud part more staccato with more rhythmic change ups, making use of abrupt silence then smashing hard, instead they're doing yet another mid tempo rerun of Rain Dance Maggie. In terms of "pop" I guess they're defining their own sound, but this was a hard and fast punk/funk band, I don't see any recognition of that anymore. These guys used to have edge, drive and purpose, rocking out with their socks out, now I can't even tell 2 decades worth of songs apart... There was maybe 4 songs worth listening to on "Stadium Arcaneum" "By the Way" had good songs, but not what I want to hear from them, anything else since has been alternate versions of their existing songs including this one. Of their first 5 albums, 4 of them were all time favorites for years, now I don't even want to listen to those because whatever hope from my youth they inspired turned into the crap they're doing now. They've broken my heart as much as "Star Wars" I'll likely skip this album, while rocking out to Fishbone's newest. Fishbone kicked the Peppers ass back in the early days and still do. It's shameful that the Peppers haven't done more to help Fishbone's career, they could have easily booked them as openers, but know they'd be shamed. If you think this is good music or definitive of the Peppers, do an experiment, Play "Me and My Friends" "Fight Like A Brave" "Suck My Kiss" or "Stone Cold Bush" loudly then play this and see which one got your rocks off. It's embarrassing what happened to this band.
Flea is just so magnificent!
Frusciante legendary ❣️
Tremendo
The closest I've gotten to these E.T is a local corner shop, munchies peanut crisps
DEJA ME GUSTA SI ERES LATINO QUE PASAS DE RAP A ROCK SIN PROBLEMA.
Hey guys, I am a rhcp fan just like all of you, and by knowing how we all tend to be compreensive, i Will now say some things. I am planing to comit suicide. I was always a really depressed guy, anxiety is one of my biggest enemeies, and recentily, my girlfriend breaked up with me, cause i was being so inconsequential in my atitudes. I lost the love of my life, and I just don't know how to get trough this Black summer. My favorite rhcp Song is "i could have lied", and it fits better than ever now.  I am so hopeless about everything, and i know that many of you May be Felling tired, so plese, GO ON AND LIVE YOUR LIFE, BE HAPPY, AND DONT EVER LET ANYONE FUCK YOU UP. We are all soldiers against this life of bad days and nights, and my time has come, i dont see meaning in life anymore. I Love all off you, and i love you so fuckin much my Love, i will always Love you.  Please, if you have any faith, ask god for some help for me. I dont know for how long i Will be here, but maybe she Will come back. And maybe i Will see The end of this Black summer. Thank you for reading, and sorry for any english mistakes.
iv been waiting on a new album to come... Just wait N just wait N
embodiment of old but gold
As always Will Ferrell kills on the drums.
Brazil Wins ✌❤
Beast of a song Thanks Guys
I have fallen in love with this song ! ❤ I love the beat & lyrics! Have this song on repeat all the time now !  Love the sound of the electric guitar, drums, etc.! The essence of this rock band never gets old. Timeless.
33 years after Under the bridge Total Respect

Will Ferrell en la batería, épico
John Frusciante 😎👍
Magical surprising chord changes
I missed these feelings!
Anthony never lost his voice in any way like many other singers from back in the day. Axl and Bonjovi come to mind.
Did I see Keanu Reeves?
Le dernié des Mohicansssssssssssssssss
Waoh quel retour, ça faisait tellement longtemps qu'ils nous servaient la même soupe que je les croyais finis, mais là ! Quel renouvellement, c'est extrêmement moderne et puis ça claque quoi ! Bravo les gars
IS BACK BABYY🔥🔥
Слава Украине 🇺🇦 🇺🇦🇺🇦
que otra banda de lamepoca de ellos...queda todavía...Metallica...megadhet, esa escena más metal, pero dentro del rock...???
Look at You  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNQEyr_FYCA
Such a good song man. Got the exact RHCP vibe in this one. Melody too it's fullest.
bellissimo brano
Frusciante!!🔥💥🤘
Nice
This came up as a ad... I thought it was a parody 😩
JoJo reference
No me imagino que solo de guitarra le ira a meter John  en algun recital a este tema.

I feel back to 90s, i love you rhcp,😘
Directo a ser un clásico!!! Ya !!! Temón 👍👍👍👍‼️
Bentornato #Frusciante. Questa è casa tua! #Anthony, #Flea, #Chad sono la combinazione perfetta per aprire lo stile unico dei #Redhotchilipeppers. In attesa dell'album, per godere del tesoro musicale. Lorenzo #ITALY
You keep me alive after long time . I was waiting for this moment,

Love the new jam. I hope the entire album isn’t in this Scottish-ish accent tho
☀️
🎸💫🍃
Finally.. i can still watch RHCP complete as a grandpa band... ALL HAIL RHCP!!!!
Frusciante comes along to literally save this song.
💣💣💣🔥🔥🔥Woooooooo
I have to admit I didn't like it at first. But it's grown on me.
Капец они постарели 🥺
Shite
I love the badadum at 1:12
1:52 vibe on 🎸🔥
I   LOVE  Red Hot Chili Peppers
After listening at this song for the last 3 weeks, watching and rewatching the video and learn to play it at the guitar. I am seriously starting to think that this is one of the Chilli Peppers best work. I love this song! Bravi!
They’re back and have reunited with Frusciante!
sounds like a different frequency since the release
❤️❤️❤️
sound of this song too good
That was cool of daniel day lewis to let Will Ferrell and sting play the dtums and  bass with him...😆
Big fan of the vocal melody in the verses
Superb Chart Topping Single, John back and peppers now hotter
I love flea.   ❤️.   Awesome 34 technique
rhcp les goo. crazy to see em performing still
It was amazing to listen to you, guys, on the radio after so many years. 🇦🇷🍷🍇💜
Terus berkarya legend
Not a RHCP fan at all but damn - this song is amazing!!
Yes, this is heaven sent. The world needs more and more Red Hot Chili Peppers music 🎶 🎵
Pinche mega rolon lml masters
Did anyone else feel SO MUCH joy when they saw John?!
I hate this look on Anthony damn get rid of that ridiculous stash already lol
I was born in 2002. I don't want to sound presumptuous, but I was lucky to see amazing things in rock history. And that was the return of the classic Guns N Roses lineup and now John with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and that’s new album. I feel incredibly happy.
Will Ferrell killin it on the drums 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤣
The Mandalorian videoboard. Deborah Chow the director 🤔
Chillies'Still bringin' it !! Boss
Frusciante sounds amazing.
Boa..
WOW!!!!! “Censorship” by the tech giants including YouTube (which will be replaced by rumble) and the horse with no head is USA led by Biden 👍🏻
Increíble!!! Pasa la vida y ustedes siguen haciendo gran música... 😎😎🤘🤘
omg
Finally guys!!! Yes!!!! Im reading the comments and I’m glad I’m not the only one thinking the same thing!
https://youtu.be/OpLQQets1kY
Disappointed. Was really expecting something far more creative with John back but this is about as generic schlock rock as it gets.
Saludos desde Colombia. Aguante la paz en el mundo y aguante los Red.
THE RHCP ARE BACK!!! COME TO ARGENTINA PLS
Hermoso
I grew up on the chili pepper dudes everyone in school used wear their tees and stuff. Gotta love the comeback!!
Too bad I would have liked your album before the nuclear apocalypse caused by the Russians. I have already ordered the CD but is it possible to put it online before tomorrow?
I love this one it’s kind of reminds me of snow hey oh And Stadium Arcadium Influence it sounds like a good old time Red Hot chili peppers type of style.
John at his absolute best  :bow:
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER
I remember 12 years ago when my uncle first introduced me to this band, i was just 10 and this is the first time i experience new music with Frusciante in the band. i am so grateful to this band, their music has  been the soundtrack to my life since i was a kid.
after all this time they are still the best
The world seems so shitty but when I listen to this song, it gives me hope that things will get better
These drum beats, those dance moves and that bass flicking the hell out of me. Thanks RHCP for this another masterpiece.
The only video where it doesn’t matter if the dislike button s gone because there would be no dislikes
Did anyone else know they stole the Flying V in their song true men don’t kill coyotes
Este tema va a ser un futuro clasico , no solo por el retorno de frusciante sino porque es un te ma zo ,  podria estar en by the way o stadium y seguiria resaltando . VOLVIO JOHNNY VOLVIERON LOS CHILI ❤
LOVE IT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ When the chorus kicks in it reminds me of a part of the tune The Unknown Soldier by The Doors ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
John is back ♥️
Here they are coming to our lives again, the same sound,  never go by, thank you for your music. We'll hope to see you
Black Summer - symbolic for war this Summer, and the world in a complete tail spin of a nightmare. Lol
Is that Keanu Reaves?
Everybody forgot about this song already
Same same same same sound ❤️🙌🏻
Terrible tema
nice symbology..
This song sounds like what you get when you ask AI to write a Red Hot Chili Peppers song
Please, release ‘Californication Video Game’‼️
Finally...  waited long for a new song 💟.. and  John is back .. what else one can wish for .. my day doesn't end without listening Rhcp .. every single song is unique ..gets you goose bumps.. rhcp single pick of guitar is also mesmerizing ..

love the rhythm of the song and of course John's return, but Anthony's lyrics are awful as ever.
time for rock for Ukraine concert
Still shirtless. Still in shape
Writing to RHCP and begging for help, please support Ukrain in these dark times,nusic can stop this war, please!
Goddamn. The waiting was sooooo worth it!   This was really what i was hoping for
Didn't listen to them for nearly 15 years, cause turned to Heavy Metal. That was a mistake... Red Hot Chili Peppers forever!
Are there nuclear explosions in the background?
Man…this one hurts so bad. My dad passed back in April and the Chilis were our favorite band. We saw them together so many times. I kinda feel like my whole life has been a black summer since he left us and I wish so bad he could be here to experience this masterpiece with me. Thank you to RHCP for giving me so many amazing memories with my pops- this song is unreal and although it hurts to listen without the big guy next to me…I am cannot stop listening
John’s solo in this is great
Como la vejez se deja notar,gracias Red Hot 🔥 por hacerme crecer escuchándolos
The sound of my childhood  Welcome back john ❤️
มือกีตาร์ กลับมารวมวง อีกแล้ว แจ่ม
Ay volvio John Frusciante a tocar con ellos que lindosssss, eme encanta, genio john!! ♥♥ los amo
Kinda meh
The Masters.
So many don't know about the black sun they reference... it's going over most people's heads.  What do you attribute the eclipse to?
The Chilli Peppers always come correct, end times ain't so bad with a proper sound track!
🇪🇨🦾😃
Welcome back John Frusciante my favorite lineup is banging music again this is amazing.
I really missed John
Los cago amando !!  y este video es lo mejor q me paso en mucho rato jajaj

Eine neue Hymne. Super der Sommer kann kommen.
Anthony Kiedis looks like Diego Verdaguer /  Anthony Kiedis se parece a Diego Verdaguer
I think they hid this. It is the greatest. I love this band!!
Sou palmeirense, d serrana sp. Brasil

I adore RHCP! I’ve been listening to “Californication”, “Parallel Universe” and “Otherside”
I love everything about this, fresh but classic RHCP. It’s so good.
😁💚Y LUV ANT FAMM0💚😁
I love you family tree 🏁🥷🏻🕉9️⃣
Rock on brothers For these are the dayz...  https://youtu.be/b1RPgGvLQ7o God bless
Awful
didnt know john wick played the guitar
Black summers matter
IT sounds to mé Like cross off otherside/californication but still new and inovating.... JUST LOVING IT
thank god, same magic, back! Good to hear you kept your sound.
My wife said," That sounds like the Chili Peppers, I was like that's them. Me and my buddy laughed and I thought what a good song. Awesome
Grande frusciante
Once the best, always the best 🤘🏽
And chinas on the dark side of the moon... lol
Yeah i think they should hang it up! Sounds boring & tired & the peppers are my fav band ever and frusciante is a huge inspiration to me as a guitar player but at this point unfortunately they got caught up in the hype of john playing with them again and its just a boring song.sounds like stadium arcadium leftovers that were rejected. Too much hype!
Questo è un altro loro pezzo che spacca...
Dios.... no puedo dejar de escucharla y cada vez que la escucho me transporta, es inevitable no erizarse con el solo de Frusciante <3. Simplemente son maravillosos!!
They're back at last!! Don't get me wrong, I love every single song they made. But that sound, men that sound..... it bring us back to the RHCP water well. One love!
Thanks John Fruciante for coming back to the band!!!
me hace acordar a cuando miraba mtv y much music cuando pasaba otherside, muy pillo
in a few days it will be: 22.222.222 thats pretty darn awesome
te extraño Isabella
This is great! Reminds me of the old stuff
Muito bom 👍 ❤❤❤🎸🎼🎼🎵
They're back!
I Thank the  Gods John Frusciante is still with us rockin the fuck out, man that solo brought a tear to my eye🤘
Just too dope, it's Red  HoT 🔥
What's up with the porn star mustache on Anthony? He looks ridiculous. Grow up already.
if i ever turn to heroin as a vice to escape this meaningless world, i know the last place ill look for validation is redhot chillie peppers
Man I totally impresse with the song
Plakala bih od srece
What is this, teaser from  Police academy 2023 scene Blue oyster club  ?
i will miss josh..
Masterpiece
YES!
<3
Os pimentas 🌶 estão em festa. Sai novo álbum e John Frusciante está de volta!!!!
The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Of course, after reading the lyrics, I have my own interpretations... That I won't get into because I am not turning this into a political discussion. He does touch on censorship in there, though. The whole sound of the song is another musical masterpiece.
Verlo a jhon nuevamente me hace llorar 😢😢😢😢
Will Ferrell still killing the drums
Sounds like man behind blue eyes by the who
Will is so talented
Ohohoho my love is back, from my teen years, thanks, love the song, goes...back to the roots
Excelente me encantan ❤
Really looking forward to the new album !! I think the bands they’re touring with this summer are ok but I’d like to see some new bands open for them like Turnstile/Angel Du$t or maybe even Don Broco
Very good, rock forever.
with Frusciante everything changes, they together create a magical atmosphere
Letra en español por favor :)
Es bueno ver a todos juntos de nuevo, gran banda y estilo único de RCHP, John is back!!! Love it
This rules. Good work guys.
Melhor banda do mundo 🇧🇷
When they say "Cremation takes it's piece of your supply", there's actually science to back that up. If you get cremated most of the carbon in you that would benefit the planet would be lost to the atmosphere, then to space.
This masterpiece stuck in my head. Play and replay from time to time .
John Frusciante back to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. That is great. Perfect song 🎸🎸🎸🎸
What a fucken banger!
🔥🔥🔥
Josh podia ficar de guitarra base ( sem se esconder como antigamente ). Eu sou retardada pelo John mas o Josh é um puta músico!
Só eu que me arrepio a lot quando o John aparece? ( Lágrimas ❤️☺️ )
Not a fan of this tune but I bet the record's gonna be awesome..I remember when "Scar tissue" came out I wasn't impressed and that record was absolutely incredible
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Soooo pumped for Aug 21 Toronto show!!! PLEASE DONT CANCEL MY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THIS
Hearing RHCP in this group with Flea's bass, John's guitar, Chad's drumming, and Anthony's voice is like hearing an old friend again.
Como sempre marcando gerações e fazendo eu me sentir bem novamente😍
they got RTX ON.
20 Millions views
literally don't see what's in your face it's sad..
😭😭😭
Welcome back music
It is crazy when a band's least talented member is its frontman and he is still awesome.
Member for member one of the best talented lineups ever.... Especially flea.....
Anthony please shave that village people mustache
Now yes!
Pure magic.
whats up with Flea with the paint?
John e RHCP nasceram um para o outro... Sua presença faz os outros musicos ficarem ainda melhores...
Not a fan of rhcp but this is a great song
Pretty little ditty
I been waiting .....I been waiting .....for another chilli peppers song to appear .they never let you down with their music love it .
Primary school when “under the bridge” was released…….. now I’m 40, and this. What a life
I will love to hear other songs with "dirkside" in the lyrics.
A new masterpiece ! Another one actually !!!
John is back
the mullet has to go though LOL
Reminds me of Vertigo from U2
the more I listen to it, the less I like it. I have been listening to RHCP since 93, I was 14 and bought BSSM. John's second return was something extraordinary, but I was expecting perhaps something more from the first single. Maybe I was expecting a return as it was for Californication, with SCARE TISSUE !! Yes, I have to admit, I had too many expectations. I will definitely buy the vinyl as soon as it comes out in April, hoping for something less mundane on the remaining tracks. Stay funky
Jeder Song von den Peppers schockt einfach :)
Welcome back John
1:52 ♡
Summar of 2050: 2022 was a good year for Music
Они не стареют!
fire 🔥🔥🔥
nostalgiaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. RHCP is backkkk.
Very srong song
John😍😎
I've been listening to you guys for 30+ years. This is good shit and reminds me of earlier times. I love it.
Rico at heir best
How does Anthony Keidis still look like this at 59???💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Hard to believe these doods are all 60 years old. Except that guitar fella.
Welcome back John. And the Chillis keeps going with some new music wich is nice and fresh. Love this tune.
Mi Banda favorita de rock
Отличный камбек Фрушанте, но и Клингхоффер был хорош. Песня на репите
Oh yeah, I ducks with this…
Llevo 24 años escuchando música de RHCP. Y puedo decir, que en inicio me gusta esta pieza. Se nota que no hay nada más que gozo y se dejaron ser. La guitarra cómo siempre con su toque. Saludos
Will Ferrell plays the drums too?!!
Flea wore a gabán!! Alv
Gosh, this band is so underrated. They should make more songs
Hope y'all like my mullet.
CHINA'S ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON....
THAT IS GREAT F**KING TRACK like it reminded me of like an evolved californication
#KAFORROCKCLUB
The realness…Putting all the so called artist out today to shame with this new track… Real musicians at work here…
rhcp with john fruciante is the best of all the times
Tengo verrugas genitales <3 <3 <3
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Keidis looking like Maromero Paez
la entrada de chad es de lo mejor que vi en mi vida
Uffff q buenooooo!!!!! John unico!
When I first heard this on radio with my dad he said that he already didnt like it but I loved it and i knew that john was back just by the exotic chords you can really tell when john is playing he doesnt have to prove hes one of the best guitar players ever by playing at a thousand miles an hour he does it by his like I said exotic chord choices and progressions make him so famous and a great fit for the band.
So smooth!  It’s like they never skipped a beat.
Thanks red hot, the band is the best, braaaasil here 🇧🇷
FINALLY heard this on the radio!!!
Grandes maestros saludos desde México
I’m so glad to see them back in action. I’ve got tickets to see them in Charlotte this year.
This song was an instant tear jerker,
top 10 RHCP song
I absolutely ❤ this 🎵  💯
I love these mother fuckers!!!  From the mitten
The minute I heard those notes, I went "Oh John I missed your notes..."
I remember watching them on MTV in the early 90s
One of the great bands of my generation 🤙🏼

CARALHO! MUITO FODA! MEU DEUS DO CEU ESTOU CHORANDO, EM PRANTOS!
Diariamente por la mañana me levanto para ir correr y pongo esta canción. Red Hot Chili Peppers es una de las mejores bandas de los 90s y espero que pronto vengan a Ciudad de México.
So many things in this world are royally screwed. But not this wonderful band. This is the sound we’ve all dearly missed.
Eu nunca consigo descrever o quanto a música deles faz eu viajar, parece até que tô transcendendo
Теперь мне ясно как будет выглядеть Дима Билан в старости
Is it just me, but does Anthony's vocals have a Gordon Lightfoot sound? I'm loving the song, am I mistaken?
nossa mano do ceu red hot é lenda, nasci e cresci ouvindo essa banda fiquei muito triste quando jonh saiu da banda hoje vir ele retorna a banda fiquei super alegre pela volta, depois de 16anos esse cara incrivel volta com tudo. sonhei muito e tai jonh de volta vai com tudo cara tu é toppp  cara caralhooo
Most underrated band ever!!! These 4 members. John adds that great guitar sound and perfect background vocals..
"China's on the dark side of the moon."  Was this a dig at them because of what they're doing to the Uighurs? I ask because they actually do have rovers exploring the dark side of the moon right now.
Its nice to see this lineup again but I gotta say this track does nothing for me
Generation X has been in black summer for 50 years , and the summer of black summers Never ever ends !
Ever since that drum skit, I can't unsee Will Ferrell 😂😂😂
Ive sent more time pretending in the mirror that I was in this band then any other lol
It's just not RHCP without frusciante
thank you for being back guys, the world needs you more than ever
Vida longa ao RHCP
Like si te gustó el Zarape de la Pulga Like if you think the Flea's Zarape it's cool !!! 🇲🇽
✳KEEP THE TRAIN ROLLING BOYZ KEEP IT ROLLING 🌞👍😁
Frusciante is back with the Peppers. COVID is entering the endemic phase. Things are seeming normal again. Good times ahead.
They should sneak Wil on the drums one video. Not say anything. Don't spotlight him. Just see if anyone catches it.   My money would be on no.
1st time I heard this it has a Jetthro Tull vibe in the beginning
essa banda é tudo pra mim 🌶️🌶️
RHCP El Ultimo bastión de la generación que creció en los 90`s y 2000's !!! BRAVOO!!
Looks like no one has understand the meaning of lyrics and the clip
Song is growing on my
Отменяется
Awesome
A lo vieja escuela red hot ❤️
This song is perfect for the playlist I assembled: "Nick Fuentes White Boy Winter Playlist" on YOUTUBE
iggy pop)))
Listened countless times in these days! How FANTASTIC is this song!!
Dang it, I needed this! This sure is some new RHCP, they didn’t mention California by name even once  Welcome back John, I’ll be ordering physical version of the new album as soon as I can
👍😄👍🇵🇪🇵🇪
LOS AMO...DESDE BOLIVIA!!!
Son lo máximo! ❤
Is a new symptom of Covid loss of hearing and sight? Because this shit is horrible.
Leyendas!, Keep Rocking!
Just fantastic!👍
FUCK WAR.....
Grande Johncito tu flow de vuelta <3 me trae muchos recuerdos del album By the way
레닷 사랑맨...
Fuck yeah rock on!
Digan lo que digan, con Frusciante es otra cosa
kiedes is old
God damn. I love their energy, and souls. It's amazing that they're still together doing what they love. Heart-warming to say the least.
Frusciante. Chemisry. This is what this band all about. ♥️
Is Kiedis wearing a bath robe? He’s really going for that grand dad look 😂
COMO LOS AMOOOOOOOOOO
The best acteur of life
Antonie go go
2.12 What are you doing Flea?
But it's good that you came to Hungary in the summer!
Frusciante is great and all yay! But why the hell does Will Ferrell play the drums?
Genius guitar playing from John. Some bizarre pronunciation from weakest link Kiedis.
Que gran rola se aventaron los RHCP
We missed you John 🥰😍❤️
Frusciante is back baby!!  Whoo hoo!
The man is straight out of JoJos bizarre adventure! He loves his own physique and his age doesn’t hold him back! Decades of singing music and they still sound original

Gracias eternas por tanta música. Y digo MÚSICA con mayúsculas. Siempre una obra de arte nueva que suma y suma a tantos éxitos. Volvieron los RHCP con todo, y con TODOS.
Sensacional como sempre 👏👏👏🇧🇷
man i cant belive john is back
0:43 gives me the goosebumps
Anthony Keidis looks like Randy Bleuthe in "Laid to Rest" video.....but after he has been living in Alabamtucky for a couple decades.
Definitely a mature and established tune - keeping to their roots, but a fresh feeling. I personally love it - I can't wait to see some live performances of this song! John - welcome back mate!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I mason tigerfox love this song as a tiger and fox it reminds me of knowing life is good but we all fall short to god. To all readers of this comment, live your best be godly be of lord god jesus christ. Becuase this is heaven music to a sense. Save life. Be vegan friendly and lovly to all.
Good to see the band back, awesome as usual.
Tipping Will Ferrell to get both an academy award and grammy for this. One of his best
EU TE AMO RHCP, EU TE AMO
I think I have new idea for beard
:')
we all were waiting for that first break from John, weren't we.

This gives me californication vibes and I am here for it
I'm not even a big RHCP fan, and I absolutely adore this song.
👏👏👏👏
I was waiting their new songs, i love it
So good! Always a fan!
Is it really just me who loved Josh? 😕 The Gateway was such an amazing album...

Just a bunch of Dads vibin
Entonces quitaron al guitarrista que estaba hace poco? Perdon no me se el nonmbre
Theys guys like U2..transcend generations..art is beautiful in any age.
red hot chili mierders
The only guitarist RHCP should create music with is John Frusciante. Only he completes their sound.
meh...
Glad they're (all) back together. Sounds good and takes me back to a time when the world wasn't as F'd as it is now.
Anybody know John’s signal chain on that lead?
No que había muerto Diego Verdaguer
Is it weird that I thought Will Ferrell is playing drum and Keanu Reeve is playing guitar? lol
Hey new, young, under 25 - et al … this is what means to play ur own instruments, write original music … not sampling , over dubbing, bullshyt ya’ll call music
The best one made by R.H.C.P.
FLEA! YOU WANNA GO McFly?
Sounds like they ain't missed a day!
Oh. Climate change. 👍
Well, what do you know?  It's the RHCP.  And yet, I'm perfectly fine with that.
que hace Keanu Reeves en este video jajaja... no mentira
I was like, "90's is back!"
Música nova, top!
funky monks, dude, always
Rock never die 💪🏼

Soy yo o Antony se parece a Silverio?
50% epic music 50% anthony kedis arms
Just sounded like it was off By the Way which was much better , thought this might be more exciting
I kinda like this song
I wish I liked this more, I've been waiting so long for John to come back.
mullets
Good to see John back in the band. Good song. I think RHCP are a little stuck in the "Californication" formula since year 2000.
Essa musica ficou top ❤👇👇 https://youtu.be/aUS07V_Xp8s
The YouTube "like" button seems not to be enough for me. Because i don't just "like" this song. I TOTALLY LOVE IT ❤️❤️❤️
Gran banda, buen sonido, la solidez la tienen y la canción es buenísima! Gracias por la magia chicos // Great band, good sound, they have solidity and the song is great! Thanks for the magic guys ❤🔥🌶
https://youtu.be/q9vwPyMc8Vc
Tellement 90's, tellement pur, tellement eux, c'est juste trop cool qu'ils sortent un son comme ca 😎 🔥🔥
John wick Is Amazing guitar
John's inclusion in the band adds just the right chemistry to elevate all 4 members to their fullest potential.
Well done lads ….. mint … love it …🤙
Esse ´é o red hot que queremos ver e ouvir
6.66 million subs.????
Just as cool as when they first came out
Sorry, Ive just never gotten into the Chili Peppers. This song is just ok. Under the Bridge is their best song and I'm surprised nobody hasn't re-made it up tempo because it is a slow song but good. Wait....don't take my idea....
Gracias verlos juntos me años de vida ..lo amo muchisimo ❤️
Great to hear Johns guitar back on rhcps tracks.
That porno stach lol... Tony
Anthony Kiedis. What a legend at 59 years of age.
LOOKING FORWARD TO A LIVE WITH JOHN FRUSCIANTE
normally I'm kind of  a tough guy, but as soon these guy start'n up --- I'm conna cry  --- since 1986  -
How does John frusciante not age?
szeretlek benneteket! köszönöm, hogy vagytok!
Vocês quatro juntos é simplesmente surreal! Tudo flui naturalmente! Que banda 💖💖💖💖
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
When you realize this song is about burning wildfires...it hits different. "Waiting on another black summer to end...." Damn.
🎸⚘⚘Supeer🎧
Frusciante Brazil love's you
This song is actually fucking sick; I love it
That's real music. RHCP eats autotune and all todays stars at fkn' dinner. Skate or die!!
the sticker with the face on Fleas bass is not Lenin but D.Boon of the sensational Minutemen
Te vuela la cabeza !!!!! 👏👏👏👏
This an absolute banger
Man that solo makes me bust
Beautiful guys!

Ive been waiting for 25 years to show you all in my country. I decided to became freakapotamous since i was 8 years old. The Otherside did that :')
I LOVE your song dark Necessities

God did i miss this classic Peppers , what great Song lets go !!!!!
2:57 - 3:40 Waitin' on another mic stand position
Da amante dei vecchi Red Hot degli album mothers milk, blood sugar sex magic, one hot minute, mi rincresce constatare che, oramai, anche loro sono finiti....Che peccato!
Well delivered, straight to heart 💓 !
Welcome back John! What an excellent track to begin the reunion. John and Flea really are masters of their craft, can’t wait to hear the rest of the album! 🤘🏻
I love the red hot Chile peppers but this video is kinda scary now that I think about it with summer coming. Russia invading Ukraine. Are we going to have black summer?
Perfectos..!! 👌☺️🖤

RHCP my men since 1988
the day rhcp dump anthony kiedis and his garbage song ruining childish lyrics back under the bridge where he belongs is the day rhcp gains like at least 50 million fans.
They lost their Essence years ago this is the new Red Hot Chili Peppers
Thank you John 🙏🏻
Thks to come back with your eternal song, i remember to my teenager life. Thaaaaanks
not an rhcp song if it doesn't mention California
te amo RED HOT  TE AMO!!!!!!!!!! FEZ MEU 2022 FICAR AINDA MELHOR COM O JOHN
Esa guitarra impresionante... 😀
ジョン復帰おめでとう！コロナが治まったら日本にも来てね！！待ってるよ〜！
Longest 10 years ever. wb John <3
Why is he singing like Kermit the Frog?  I kept waiting for the lyric "Why are there so many songs about California?".
Best Music in the world I love Chili Pappers...❤❤❤❤
Booooooooooooo.
RHCP back to track, i really love it..
6.66m subscribers! Really? Are you guys all coming out of your hiding places?  What a shit show! LOVE IS RISING and you won't be able to stop us!
20M views in 3 weeks, it's safe to say they arnt going anywhere any time soon.
The fact they weren't murdered during the filming of this video is testament to the essential decency of mankind.
I get it fellas, thank you for being there for the people.
So great seeing John back with them, I love this song. Long love RHCP
Frusciante is God.

At a time when we question everything around us, we're saved by memories of a better time.
Not a huge RHCP fan, but that's a good song!
Music is music. It comes in many genre despite the changing trends of the music industry. Many of us will always have our own distinct music taste.

A perfect poem for the modern age.

Always love their works. This is masterpiece.

Protect these men at all costs
John 🥺
I love the way Will Ferrel play the drum 🤣
Como sempre incrível
2022
My bad song to does better years!
I want Anthony to shave it! For some reason I can't get used to his face with the mustache. In my book he is the most besutiful man alive♡♡♡
obrigado por existirem
You almost ade me cry 🖤🖤🖤🖤💙❤️💓🤘 Cris By The Wayyyy 🍸🚩🇦🇷☮️🔉🔊🎵🎶
Omg  , I am so happy to see John. I didnt think to see him back. This video popped up and I was not watching it, until the guitar caught my attention. So happy your are back John.  .
Some songs take a few listens... This one... INSTANT FAVORITE!
fuck, thank you
Tem alguém do Brasil aí que foda esse som 🤘🏽🤘🏽

This is like crack
Will Ferrell on the drums
Volvio Frusciante ? Me encantó el tema,suena hermoso ,y hermoso vídeo 🇦🇷
Live goes on, nice
It's just as typically RHCP as all the others. As soon as I hear one of your new songs I know I've arrived. The mood is coming. I can't be disappointed in you. 🤩🤩🤩
It's like black hole sun and under the bridge had an illegitimate child.
Same song different year. Whatever
O QUE ESPERAR DO NOVO DISCO??? MAIS UM CLÁSSICO PRA HISTÓRIA!!! RHCP KICKS ASS AGAIN!!!
Nice porn stache.
Come back strong again... viva john frusciante viva  R.H.C.P
lovee john frusciante 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Josh, Dark necessities was the top of your season. And the peppers are back now!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reXbJwI-Bxs
So. Fucking. Good.
Evolution of Californication.. Great sound
Están intactos. Con la vuelta de Frusciante son Perfectos!!!!
I listen their songs since I was 16, now I'm almost 46. They're the soundtrack of my life. And yes, John is back, again. Long live to RHCP!
Vida longa aos Chili Peppers, sempre os amarei ❤️
Anthony removing his shirt @1:27  John's wailing solo @1:53 Yup!! they're back !!
Not digging all that vocal autotune stuff. I guess maybe Kiedis is losing his vocal range in his old age.
There are very similar solos on guitar pedal review channels and also there are more creative solos.
I need a RHCP doc please
If they keep aging this way, we'll be getting new Pepper music for another 20 years... at least!!! 😁❤️
I need to start surfing! Sheesh
Guitar solo is the money shot of this song.
This is officially now my #1 favorite red hot chili peppers song🎸🌶️🌶️🔥🔥
no one talk about 6,66m subs?
this is my happy place
Thought that was Will Ferrel on the drums for a moment.
this is the music of the red hot
John has come home :)
Nice Door's  rip off. Idk why I am still a fan.  Those lyrics though. The videos always seems to obfuscate what I am hearing in the song with them. Interesting video with everything that is going on.
I honestly... I honestly can't... I love almost every RHCP song... And I gotta say, this may be one of their worst.. John  played a nice solo, but come on... All of you saying "they still the same after 40 years omg" no... No that is not the same. Where was Flea at? This is going to be another Anthony album and it's the last albums like this that almost cost the band Flea, just saying. This isn't what the band was about at all..
Will John play songs from the last two albums at concerts ?
John speak whit guitar ❤️
Ya hacía falta algo así 😎 RHCP for ever! 🤟
Want to like it twice.
Straight outta the 90s. Love it!
Gardner Minshew or Uncle Rico with mustache
I still can't not see Will Ferrell on the drums.
Why is Anthony singing  like an English farmer?
Everyone keeps talking about essence still intact I cant be the only person who noticed the the random notes and rifts from their top 10 songs in there. now if it was intentional I would have to ask did you do it to subconsciously play with people's nostalgia for your music to make them like the song or did you do it for your hardcore fans to see if anyone noticed? But regardless of the answer you either A.) Did it without realizing it because the essence isnt there anymore  or B.) Did because you assumed it would  make the song do better statistically and new that only the hardcore fans would notice it thus guaranteeing a certain level of success. And Anthony looks like he went back and watched some of their old music videos and then just memorized a bunch of the moves and through them all together and then benge watched the tiger king. I dunno I grew up on them and their music is definitely a memory trigger to my childhood and teenage years but Its just not there anymore for me at least. Maybe if they do a whole album then ill feel differently based on other songs but this 1 just sounds like new lyrics on a mash up of their greatest hits.
Rdv le 8 juillet au stade France 🤩

Hello from Ukraine! Thank you very much for your masterpieces. Your music helps me overcome panic of anxiety. Hopefully, in the future when everything will be ok you`ll come to us with unforgettable show. I wish peace for everyone. Update: no safety at all I wrote this comment a few hours before the full-scale war started  Now there are: shells, fire, explosions, rockets, snipers and even mines... 09.03. I am still alive, I stay home, it`s a really tough time. Thank you all for your support❤️
Welcome back John
Que buena canción, ustedes nunca decepcionan !!!

why does it feel like they never left? never changed? always rhcp
Will Ferrell on drums? Lol 😂
Frusciante > Klinghoffer imho
Showwww🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Just what the doctor prescribed!
❤️
This so great, for the Years they have now
Essa música é fraca diante dos Peppers.
meh
Vuelve a tener sentido la música con tu regreso JF
Herzklopfen und Freudentränen in den Augen wenn ich euch höre
jUST TOO SOFT . Making money on the name. NOT GOOD
its awesome to see that they haven't changed much
JOHN FRUSCIANTE FOR PRESIDENT!!!
Ricordi di quando eri ragazzino, Californication il primo cd acquistato con i soldi guadagnati
que maravilha, i need moreee!!
I'm so over the edge Lord nonsense of people saying that the heart of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is *someone who died since 1988* !  Come one guys ! Most of RHCP music was made after Hillel Slovak died. Most of the band's career and their highest moments of musical success came years after Hillel Slovak died.  The first Album was released in 1984. Slovak died in 1987.   9 out of their 12 albums were released after his death.   I would say that anyone who got to know the RHCP after Slovak's death and has been there from 1987 onward *with John Frusciante as the most constant guitarist* are used to the sound of this line-up.  All respect to Slovak, he was the OG. But the reality is he died very early in the band's infancy.
WOW!! We all needed this.
these guys are 60 years old, besides John. But thats crazy
i wasn't expecting another BSSM but this is bad..
Except for Frusciante, this is boring as hell
I just wish Anthony wasn't doing that weird accent on some words lmao
I'm glad to be alive 🤘😭
Fucking hell this is good, So happy to see new music that's actully good!
like wine….. older and always better 👍🏻💪
I always thought that John’s presence, makes Anthony want to sing better.
When John goes “aahhhhhhhhh” my heart does the same. 🥲 And when his guitar goes “whoe-wha-wha-who-who-whahhhww!” I go 🤘🏻😭
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq8LRIYTwys
“It’s been a long time since I made a new friend” this hits deep because as you grow older, it’s hard to find and keep friendships that are meaningful.
Complete garbage. Hang it up yoga grandpa's.
...basically the last two albums weren't bad, Josh gave them freshness, with John they'll be good old rhcp again...
Hell yeah!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Thank you for being you! Spirit never ages.
From first 2 seconds you understand that is RHCP!!
Temazooo!!!
Not a fan sorry 😐. I still like chilli peppers but this song is not it
Do you want it darker: deep beats with Eastern sounds and rainbow horses? Check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-CFP1sbJgM
Without John Fruciante there is no RHCP.
Go to 20 million views lol
You just can't beat the feeling. They're legends.

This is amazing 😍
♥
typical RHCP and return of John with his pentatonic melodies
Me gustan mucho los RHCP, pero ya me suena todo lo que hacen igual. No encuentro material nuevo fresco, con un toque un poco diferente. Mismas melodías, estructuras. Ya los tiempos de Blood Sugar Sex Magic pasaron.
Oh shit, didn’t realise John was back!
❤❤❤ Noi Hanureyko!!
Adoro essa pegada que eles passam na música
🏆🏅🥇🥈🥉🎖
sounds good! can you say iconic & longevity = RHCP
Another song please
😭 Beautiful
the "derk" side of the moon. wtf lmao
Resin.
I wonder if they are talking about another black tar summer to end?
My lifeʻs theme music is almost exclusively played by RHCP…. And Pac lol. Whenever chili peppers stop ill probably keel over dead;)
WILL FERRELL  ARE AMAZING ON DRUMS, LIKE USUAL....
OMG IS THAT KEANU REAVES??
Nice to see them back 🥰🥰
Los que Todos esperamos.... 💪😎🇦🇷
I waited this music for a long time...
Is he attempting an Irish or Scottish accent?
!!!!!!!!!
This one is amazing. I guess its pretty hard to fit in the music to current trends. But what i see - is my lovely RHCP, no matter what
My beloved 'hyper electric energetic' band is back to their amazing best 🤩 Seeing John back brought tears to my eyes 🤟
22222 there man is here.
Amazing song...
Yeahh that style 🔥🔥🔥 That's how strat should be played 👍
So fucking beautiful to have John back!  John's solo is so mesmerizing it took me a million listens to finally notice that Flea is also riffing his ass off during the solo.  Now I've been focusing on Flea's playing throughout this song and holy shit is it brilliant.  Not like that's surprising but man, John and Flea really have a musical connection that is palpable.  When John's in the band, Flea's playing is elevated and super-inspired.  And I love at 3:14 ish Chad is singing "Ive been waiting" but they cut away after just a split second.
Same old sounds welcome back John
No offense to all the other Guitarist that have been part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, they are all excellent, however John Frusciante is at another level and his pairing with Flea is unmatched. Can't wait for April 1!
Johnny still kicking a hole in the sky!
That stash... lol
I'm hopeful for this one.. John is back 🙏
So glad you guys came back again.
This music video popped up as an ad. Not going to lie, I thought it was a joke at first. I thought the lead singer looked like Justin Long from Tusk. And then the drummer showed up, and he looked like Will Ferrell, and that’s when I realized it was Red Hot Chili Peppers
Just awesome.
YESSS BRING THIS ERA BACKKK MOREEE NEED MOREEE 😂
Jhon 😻
🌶 is good 🥃🙏😎
Ahh. Love it
A Scar Tissue da vez. Muito bom!
This is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
❤️❤️
Colombia (y Latinoamérica en general) los espera con ansias.
OMG YES, YES, YES!!!
de pie que suena el himno
love it!
Beautiful song  Thank you
These guys are one piece characters
Fucking luv this song!! RHCP still kickin ass after almost 40yrs...badass!!
Amo RED HOT! Gostei muito da música, com a essencial da banda!PERFEITA!
My sister died this month. It will be a Black Summer for me and my siblings. R.I.P. Flossie!!😢
Is he actually singing with a mock Irish accent? 😂
creo que no soy el único que cree que John Frusiante se parece a Jesús
🔥🔥🔥
Hermosoo!!
Agora está tudo no seu devido lugar,  Amo demais, o John  é o melhor do mundo pra mim, ♥️♥️♥️
When do these guys start getting discussed as the GOAT? They are in their 5th decade of cranking out hits- that's absurd. They're Rolling Stones status at this point.
que bien ha envejecido Will Ferrell.
Perfeito 🌶👏
Foda !
I love the Chillies but what is with the Canadian accent in this song?
Legends!!!
Worth the wait, happy 😊
🤘😎🤘
I was 13 yrs old when started listening to them their first hits were 'Give It Away' and 'Under The Bridge'..Now Im 42 and this song brings me back to that time..
You guyz are Rock and Roll.  Keep it up!  Love the song!
Still got it 🔥 Love it more every time I hear it...
I was listening to these guys back in the '80s, and the other day my daughter was listening to a new song and I looked over and said "thaaaaaaaaaaat sounds like the Red Hot Chili Pepper's!!!" and she said "it IS!!!"
I'm so glad John Frusciante is still the greatest guitarist of our time 😊
essencia q esses caras passam, RED HOT mlk
hey guys! ...  you are finally back.
I've been listening to this song every day since it's release and I still get some blissful tears in my eyes when watching this clip... We are so fortunated that John returned home.. Seeing them live has been my dream since I'm 14, I'm now 28. John, you are so loved all accross the world. I can't even explain the impact that your music, your guitar playing had and still has on my life. Thanks whatever greater force that is for reuniting this blessed group.
Это охуенно. Люблю вас всех.
Inject this into my veins
Looks like a shred ! :O
Can someone tell me where I can buy poncho like the bassist in the video??
This is the best song in history of humankind. I can't stop listning!!
La voz de Kiedis es la banda sonora de los momentos más hermosos de mi vida, also, Frusciante 🖤
Another watch....... why not! One my favourite bands. Love these guys!
+10
I love the chili peppers but this song might have the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard. Still sound great, and I’m happy JF is back!
I luv you RHCP,  you simply nail!
Método PI Naruto um povo era metade do preto chamar Uber a mulher
Mmmmm.kind comments below..
Continua os mesmos incrível 🤘
Legal essa música e Red Hot Chili Peppers Olha o Antônio eu sou do Brasil
я по ходу что-то пропустила? Фрущ вернулся? это же мечта тысяч фанатов!!! Джони, с возвращением домой!!! это легенды уже, кайфую от их звука♥️
🇷🇺❤️👍👍👍
Here’s the chili peppers I remember I am so glad John is back man what a team his guitar riffs and solos soothe the soul ! Alive again for another great rhcp album 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Ебана рот,  это лучшая группа)
Buen tema está genial
I like it. Love red hot chili  peppers!
Hell yea, hype is real !
I grew up listening to these guys 💕 can wait to raise my children on good music
I just love John’s solo! The fact Flea is jamming along with a bucket of paint and paint brush whilst wearing a poncho is excellent too 🤣
Black summer was 2020.
The drummer never got better, same old beat.
Hurdy gurdy voice
It's really sad listening to this.. Not decent as 30 years ago
Whats a black summer
I THANK YOU, for ALL the Great Music over the years! I remember being hypnotized watching "Breaking The Girl" on MTV way back in the 80s , haha i was like 7 or 8
Lo máximo 🙌
Will ferrell. What have people told you about touching others peoples drum set
goosebumps
RHCP band made different project with John frunciante composition is almost superb
lml
Есть ещё порох ,в пороховницах .С годами Перцы,хуже точно не стали!!!
One thing that was missing without JF is the backup vocals. The guy is the king of backup vocals
Its good to see Will Ferrell back in the band
@UCyrKXy7rz6yJgTvJLQAu0dg indeed, I have been to see them only twice since they released that dross of Californication. I am now slightly embarrassed when people notice the eight point Aztec sun logo in prime place on my right shoulder in black, then they stopped trying after sacking Navarro, which I felt was a shame, but then ol' sulky bollocks was saved from his intentional heroin addiction. Followed by bland music, then boring then more of the same. It makes me feel both old, and cheated
They're at a point where they don't care to have John Frusciante play some out of tune notes in his solo on the official recording... Not sure if I should feel embarrassed for them or applaud their 'we don't give a f***' attitude
This gives me a lord of the rings vibe. Kinda like a folk tale song with knights n elf’s
John is back ! I’m gonna freaking cry with joy ..
Am I having a hallucination .. is that JF????  .. if so .. God does answer prayers!
Is that Will Ferrell at :57 mark?
First single from last album was great yet the whole album wasn't, this single is amazing I hope the album is awesome too
Healthiest I've seen Anthony look in a looong time.  Awesome!

Une tuerie...merci les red hot 😉
just as fresh as in the 90s
Bro Anthony is ripped what the fuck   60 year olds usually shouldn’t be shirtless with their gelatinous bodies gyrating everywhere but he is the exception
okaeri

He needs to lose the mustache
Jimi Gilmour
Been years since I've seen Anthony Kiedis aging.....and with shirt
The best
Boring song..not impressed..put u to sleep..how can people like it
Anthony be like: *doing tiktok dances* John: *continuing to never age* chad: *looking like will ferrel always* flea: *making weird faces like he is having a fit*
John is just *chef's kiss*
John is BACK
La esencia intacta siempre de los peppers ❤️los banco forever 🇨🇱
regreso el guitarrista ???
RHCP getting old but still...😎
Welcome back John <3 Nice to see you together again in this shitty period guys ! Wainting for the light again !!
You all sang someone else's song and you sold it. ...i believe thats a sell out. Love ya anyways.
Oh yeah, yes,yes... Feel your vibes... Endless Love for you Guys ❤️
And they're back 💪💕😘
Their new album will have 17 songs! Amazing. Will definitely buy when it releases.
way way cool....brilliant!!!!!
Amazing song at x1.5
Con John se enciende la llama de Los Peppers!
Fookin'hell, RHCP needed Frusciante back in order to be the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS again! This sounds more like it!
Aşırı yükleme oldu muse, coldplay, mor ve ötesi  video yayinladı😁
John is back Barvo from Thailand
Fraquíssima!

Que viva Frusciante solo lloró de emoción al verlo 🥺❤️
there are few people in this workd who can wear a mullet with this much style
Welcome back frusciante
Cremation is like Crimea
It's good, I like it.
Cool solo, overall mediocre chili’s song. Happy to have John back. Why the hell is Anthony so heavily auto tuned?
I literally didn't listen to them for 10 years while Josh was there ..  John comes back and the music is back to rocking.... Yay
They never lose their essence !!!
Is that Will Ferrel on the battery? :)
Didnt know Jimmy Hendrickx played with Red Hot
Jhon kembali
THE SQUADS ALL BACK
Cool, another Stadium Arcadium. Wonder how long it will take John to abandon them again this time?
I love this song It's 2 weeks since this came out, I feel so happy this Is my second album as a chili peppers fan I remember when the getaway came out and my dad was reading the tracklist to me I remember watching their performances on T In the park and reading and Leeds over and over again can't wait for this new era I've waited for ages 🙂
Last time they played with John, the iPhone hadn’t even been released yet 🤯 The world has changed so much since then, but they still have that classic RHCP sound. This sounds like a song that could’ve been from Californication, BTW, or Stadium Arcadium.
Pretty mediocre. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Holy shit this is worse than I imagined
They dont know the word old....forever feels young 💪💪💪
When the world needed them the most they returned. Long live The Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶!!
Still dope.
This band is a National treasure.
Top tier chili peppers.
Thanks🙏❤️
as happy as i am to see frusciante again, i liked josh klinghofer’s minimalist style a LOT.  rhcp with another guitarist sounds interesting.  sherman, slovak, navarro, and klinghofer.
6.66 millions subs...
❤️ 🔥 🥶  🌶  Red Hot Chilli Peppers
imagine the grandchildren saw this and said "that's my grandpa".. 😁
La esencia intacta siempre de los Peppers ❤ Los banco Forever 🇦🇷
Yessss
🤘
Unmistakably them
One guitar solo beats 10 years of that idiot they had!!! What's his name....omg Josh is forgettable
This shows just what a great band they have always been.  Welcome back John
I don't ever want to feel like that day when you took apart of me that day at lentines music on brookpark road in Cleveland Ohio and you did it again .....
Am I crazy or does this sound like an old Jethro Tull song?
Essa música e o clipe representam a inversão do campo magnético.
Legend
oh my RHCP.
This is what 2022 needed 🤤
John it's back, Chili Peppers it's back
Much better with speed 1.25 hahahahahahahahaha
Legend is back...🎉🎉
Anthony’s vocals sound so auto tuned and over produced….. it’s a shame. Would have been an amazing track otherwise.
Cuando en argentina???
Hey John, we're shooting the video today. Could you please take a shower and maybe put on some clean clothes? SMH
God
Theee peppers 🌶
😽
Te amo Juan gracias por volver. Vengan urgente a Chile
I still wonder if life peaked in 2006.  This song brings me back to then.  If it is fantasy, so be it.
Can’t wait to see you guys live this summer ❤️😩❤️❤️
Viajando aqui nessa vibe.
Una maravilla
Crazy 🔥🤘👏👏👏👏👏👏
Finally! Finally the big boys are back
Is this for the show on Netflix?
Love it
no sabia que Diego Verdaguer reencarno en Anthony Kiedis xD jajaja  por cierto buena canción ✌
Fruaciante is back, baby!
You know how I feel about Ya'll! This is the band you listen to living life as a soundtrack! Forever ya fan...
It has like a Celtic hymn style to it, very Irish the way Anthony is singing on this one! I love it! One for Slane Castle for sure!
São d+
Seeing these guys age so God damned well makes me not feel so bad about my parents who are younger then them. I tell them all the time they still have the potential to handstand like flea haha
I didn't know will ferrel could play drums so good
John Frusciante é Red hot chili peppers, e Red Hot Chili Peppers com John Frusciante é Red hot chili peppers de verdade!
I got chills when I saw Frusciante back & play his solo!! This is the original four for always!!
Can’t wait to hear the live version.  Gunna be fire.
Feel like so much greatness could of been made if they never splitted
ジョン返ってきたぁーーー❣️  アンソニーは髭剃ってよ草
Couple things.... The older Anthony gets, the more he looks like Iggy Pop.  Also, it's great to have John back.
It's crazy to think these guys have been an active band for 39 years! Anthony Kiedis looking like Jon Bernthal, lol.
Ouço red hot desde de criancinha, o som desses caras são foda**  tô ensinando os meus filhos a ouvir as músicas deles pra aprender o que e música de verdade
John frusciante 🖤
As soon as Anthony started to sing, I realized that this vocal melody and chord progressions are composed by John. It’s too easy to imagine John hummed this melody while making the song.
Really good
One of the great lineups in music history.  These 4 guys obviously work very well together.  Looking forward to hearing this new album.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
mr. Steal Yo Granny !! ive been waitin, waiting for this band to come back. good music never dies
Like AC/DC they don’t disappoint.  Very happy John is back.
I am so glad to see John Frusciante back !!!
that guitar solo... like holy shit I've never heard anything like it
This is fukkin epic. Thats it. No need to say more.
Bentornati ❤🌶
Man, what a flop!
El mejor grupo! La canción está muy genial <3
This song it's simply AMAZING
This video is well cut. Very well indeed.
Justo cuando pensé que este grupo se había ido a la nada, sacan una nueva canción...
AND........... THIER BACK, After 10 years with josh writting nothing new, Johns back and theres already new tracks flying out, and a new album  coming, 🤔🤔🤔
I love RHCP, but this is just icky lol seems forced.
Awesome, wait for new album, Ukrane with you!
🔥UNLIMITED LOVE (APRIL 1) 🔥
Los mejores, los amo. Gracias por salvar mi vida una vez más
I got shit on hard for having his exact haircut in middle school
He looks like Hitler
Walks Like Techno viking
IS IT ME OR DO THE chillies peppers LOOK LIKE THEY,RE 40 YEARS OLD AND THEY ARE 60 . THEY INSPIRE BE WHEN IM 60 THEY ARE ROCKING OUT NOW EVEN BETTER THEN WHEN THEY WHERE IN THERE 20S. IM GUESSING NOMORE DRUGS GOOD STUFF!!
los amo son lo mejor del universo <3
Is this song about nostalgia for summer 2020?
Johns back so all is good with RHCP he is such a crucial part of their sound.
Loveeeee♡
Was waiting on yall to get back together for an album!  Super excited, Stadium Arcadium changed my life I was already a huge fan but after that album I was hooked. So I'm sure this one will be as good or better!
Only in Michigan?
So glad John is back. This sounds like classic RHCP, just an unbelievable groove!
By the way, I like this song!
♥️
The boys are back in town 🤘
It's amazing to see that frusciante has such an influence on their sound. This feels so vintage rhcp, exactly what I have been waiting for!
Is this a Lenin face sticker on the Flea's guitar?
Bleak
when ever I listen to red hot chili pappers can't believe the led guitar player haven't got fired!!!
Watched this video in 240p for the full nostalgic experience <3
Omg John turned into keanu reeves!
the guitar of this song are amazing.
The band could put out a song they made cleaning the house and it would be a hit. Absolutely love them. 💕💕
Californian essence at their best, thank you guys, we missed you
Sounds like jethro Tull looks like one of the chuckle brothers great sound though 👍🏽
Excellent tune! Flea looks the same!😳😁
He looks like "SPARKS."
Now this is what music should be all about
O my god
RHCP playing RHCP music!
Долгожданный и очаровательный момент, услышать новую песню от Перцев! Ещё и увидеть их в новом классном видео! С Фрушанте! Это грандиозно!
i like how he snuck "behind the sun" into the lyrics
Damn I love me some Chili Peppers
Superb. Endlich mal wieder gute Musik.
I Totally felt it black angel

🇩🇴🤟🤟🤟🤟never die
Ha vuelto, ha vuelto!...John ha vuelto!!!
The band looks like they tried all the drugs in the world. Good music though.
La misma esencia de cuando quede enganchado con esta banda. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I cannot put into words, how happy I am to see Frusciante back on the guitar again.
FRUSCIANTE ARE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT REINCARNATED AS A GUITAR PLAYING MAN?!
isn't it odd that the band with a member named chad has been one of the few long running bands able to keep their style going strong? reminds me of the virgin vs chad meme tbh
Thank you 🙏
Let's do the time warp again
Anthony looks noticeably older, as do I. Haha But they sound great! John's back!
Timewarp vibe! Still killin it!
This ossans did it again
Jaman john sangat berbeda dari jaman nya si josh. Apalagi dalam pemilihan cord
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS lo mejor que me pasó, me pasa y me pasara...son los unos !!!!que nunca se termine!!!!
what are these 4 grandpas doing there? and why is one of them naked? call the retirement home to bring them back.
RHCP comeback!!!
Cant wait for the new album, some amazing guitarwork on its way from Johnny
Can't believe Anthony is 60 now this man still looks damm good and energetic
indeed ? They are back from real ???
Talk about Longevity!
Os caras são muito bons, mantendo o estilo com qualidade! 🔥🎸🎶
Muito foda!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end

JOHN 🎸👌
odvratno

can u feel the rift bruh...the voice....goddamn ill miss that moment
Very strong climate message , maybe a dig at SCOMO with the headless horse line. So great to see John back however young Josh was / is an amazing talent and kudos to him for all he has done.
Amazing.
China is on the dark side of the moon. Keep rocking. RHCP, I bow down.
Take my money and release the album please ......
Welcome back Red Hot ❤️🤗 Wonderful song
That was almost getting my kcid hard ok I'll listen to that over there now
When you hear The Red Hot Chili Peppers, you’re listening to The Red Hot Chili Peppers. There is no confusion. They are indistinguishable and timeless.
I love all of your videos and this does keep to the vibe that I fell in love with when I first heard your music but after waiting 3 odd years I like this song but I believe yous boys could’ve made a well better song after 3 years tbh and I believe yous need to come back to Scotland for a show, I seen yous at the last t in the park when I was 16 and it was the best show av seen n the only actually good show ever since and I work at most events and no other band compares to yous, much love hope to see yous soon
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Lenin's portrait at Flea's guitar is not cool, is not cool at all.

Did anybody else got back to the great 90's????
World's greatest band 😎👍
Still rippin 🤙
🧡
Does anybody else not like this song?
This is great, combining an experimental style with their traditional style.
Simplesmente a Melhor Banda de todos os tempos. Os anos passam os caras estão intactos.
Man. I was so very excited for John's return. But who's producing this bubble gum? Mickey Mouse goes harder than this. But it looks like my 14 y/o nephew did a really good job with the PowerPoint music video. Didn't their videos used to be cutting edge? Or something? Art? Who wants to buy my ticket to their Dallas show in Sept? Niandra La Des or Niandra La Die!!!
Esta es la razón por que no gustan los Pittsburgh Pirates.
Caraca amigos que música parabéns cara 😍quanta saudade eu sentir de vocês 🇧🇷🇧🇷 Brazil is Here
The 🐐 s
Volvieron los que saben Vivan siempre RHCP
Anthony is 60 this November and he is still Sexy RESPECT
Damn Fajardo nailing that lead shit
indonesia mana suaranya🤘
The best band is still putting out the best music! The comment section shows how far and wide RHCP music reaches! I love seeing all of the languages! RHCP music speaks to the world!! ❤️🌶🌶🌶
OMG Frusciante's chords amazing!

Welcome back legend!
Se parece a Chuck Norris XD
Já prestou... Desde 2006 para cá, só têm produzido lixo!
As a near 59 y/o Anthony sure has a great body...damn
They should have kept josh
This is the beginning of their downfall 👎↘
Jesus come back to RHCP!!!
This is amazing! Good on them! 🤩
Awesome ......RIP Mum this is your song

Copiando o vinho , quanto mais velhos,  melhores 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

The people that are amazed there sound is still genuine need to pick a different band.   Casuals
Y’all she makes my day better and it’s also my birthday
Just coming back

Damn, Anthonys haircuts are in a constant decline since 1991. You think it can't get any worse and you get disappointed again and again...
Amazing.. these guys are the best  after all the years together 👍🏻x
Great song from great RHChP 😎✌️

John is an absolute unit of a guitarist.

frucsiante here looks like john wick
Obrigada, tanks  pimentas vermelhas 😍
Why is Will Ferrell still playing drums at his age. Not healthy.   ;)   Just kidding. Frusciante delivering the vibes again. Weird connections just connecting.

I love how John brings that fuzzy essence back.
Love it
RHCP thank you for the music your giving us. Stil the same like 90s, and stil so perfect no matter how music changed this days
0:46 That's when John tells us that he's f***ing back! Love that guys!
It's so good to have John back. Love this new material. They had a bit of a rocky period for a bit
You make me red hot every time you put out a song.
very good, muito bom
Diego Verdaguer eres grande!!!
He is back, I can't believe my eyes, but my ears feel it! 😭😍
John is back, for our biggest pleasure !!!
A very great band, like the Red Hot, never dies, and in opposite rises from the ashes, again and again.
vei bonito
Love it. Does the beginning sound like Sailing to Philadelphia
Не верится, что Кидису в этом году уже 60, а он в такой охуенной форме🐱👍
Ya hacia falta un tema así de chingon, RHCHP 4ever. ¡Saludos y buena vibra desde México! 🇲🇽✌️
Kalau ada jhon frusciante..musik rhcp hidup lagi...sukses terusss rhcp...

headless horse..... could be me. Call me Vasudeva.  great Song, great video, thank you chilli Peppers!🙋

おおお！やっとジョンが帰ってきた！！！！！嬉しすぎる
Love that immediate Frusciante feel
Anthony's now Irish and wears opium den smoking gowns...perfect sense...nice fuzz solo...not Hendrix like..as some say but follows melody nicely and the sonic interface prior key change is fun. Anyhoo...let's wait and see. Bit tame but there will be harder stuff I'm (Irish accent) sure.
Can't wait for this....sounds like stuff off of mars Jupiter...Love it.....Shouts from 12000 miles away out here in Greece....Nothing but love and respect for you guys. Health and happiness.           Σας αγαπάμε πολύ εδώ. Ζω σε νησί και η μουσική είναι τέλεια για αυτή τη ζωή...χα χα αν καταλαβαίνεις τι εννοώ. Υγεία και ευτυχία σε εσάς και την οικογένειά σας
Waooo que maravilla chicos!! Feliz de verlos  juntos, haciendo buena música!! Gracias por este regalo!! Buenas vibras para empezar el año 2022!!!
Awesome band 🎸👍🏻💯 I'm glad John's back. He better stay this time.

frusciante!!
Most consistent band on earth
aguante RHCP! LPM!!!
Is it 1996? Retrotastic!
They don’t ever disappoint, thank you for all the years of happiness your music has always brought me in moments without any semblance of peace.  Never change, RHCP. ❤️
Finally, some real music.
Waiting on another hit album from the peppers to end!
Born in 1986 and a fan since 94. Love the Peppers and thrilled that John has returned.
Que buena música, aquí una  fanatica de ustedes ❤️
Awesome 👌
The new guitarplayer: John Wick!
There aren't many in the history of guitar playing who can deliver such a simple and yet compelling solo as John Frusciante, and the world is better for him rejoining the rest of the Peppers
Gave me chills seeing John for the first time in a long time 🔥🔥🔥😎🤘🏻 He makes that guitar sing!
Brilliant
С возвращением Фрушанте Перцы снова стали звучать как Перцы. Клингхоффер конечно тоже крутой чувак, но как по мне для Перцев звучание Фрушанте больше подходит.
This drums are awesome!
Hay alguna canción que estos weyes no hagan bien? Los escucho en la eternidad, gracias por el hermoso regalo
If Anthony is trying to look like the biggest asshole, he succeeded. The hair, ‘stash, awkward gestures… creepy.
Очень рада, что Перцы продолжают творить! Да ещё все в старом стиле!!! Песня удивительно мелодична)
This one really hits home.
o frusciante voltando trouxe com ele toda a essência do rhcp… cara monstro
0:55 drum part from Californication <3
I miss josh Klinghoffer ):
Старики шарят .🇺🇦👍
April 1st!!! We just need to wait for a bit longer then it’s Album time then seeing them live is gonna be the most beautiful thing In the world
Que clase de Dani California es este?
Hadir sehat terus Mr antonio
Australia 🇦🇺 ❤️
Frusciante's guitar playing is amazing. His guitar is warm, melodic, and engagingly complex.
Salam dari Indonesia
tetep keren 👍👍👍👍
Hearing John’s backing vocals/harmonising again lift’s my heart with incredible joy, I cannot even begin to put into words
Am glad John Frusciante is back. He's the true glue that keeps the RHCP together, glad to see the boys are back together once again
Love it
Guitarist keanu reeves
The song fucking delivers
Seems like Anthony is channeling Eddy or Hector Guerrero.....Mainly EDDY
Finally... 👏👏👍👍
The haircuts of Chad
red hot chili frusciante...
Beeem Frusciante. Ele faz Anthony voaaaar. Awsome!!!!  <3
rock is still alive 🥲
Chuck Norris está cantando muito bem...
Te amo anthony
When did Keoanu Reeves join the RHCP?

✔️ Promo_SM!
It feels like it's been out years already. I can't wait for the new album!!!
The first RHCP song I've actually liked!
Dude... how is Anthony 59... my God.
So refreshing in present shit and dead musical market!!!!!
Omg Great song. Authentic rhcp
Wow! What a song! I also love the Dark Side of the Moon reference!
Es demasiado extraño como con una cancion que es nueva, al escucharla sientas nostalgia.
I absolutely loved both albums they did with Klinghoffer. But there is something about the foursome of Kedis, Flea, Smith, and Frusciante that makes my soul complete.
This song reminds me of good times.
Addio RHCP.
Arrechísimos
I love the rhcp
Não consigo ficar um dia sem escutar essa música maravilhosa, meu Deus do céu, simplesmente os melhores de todos os tempos 🤘🤘
Afterlong time feels like rhcp still in same didn't change at all
You guys are in great shape all look very healthy!
Finalmente! Black Summer è un bel brano, non vedo l'ora di ascoltare gli altri nel disco che uscirà. Vi aspetto a Firenze!
Banda gigante, entretanto, essa música é mto ruim. Abraços a todos
❤❤❤❤❤🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵 I hope someday you come to Ecuador for a concert ❤❤❤❤I'll be waiting for you!.
Pearl Jam Gigaton
cool
Love  it can't wait  4 marley Park
This group is timeless they are the greatest and the best
Great as always!!!!!!! 🌶🌶🌶🌶
It's not the Chili Peppers without Frusciante.
That DS-2 is back??? 😀
Rock is no longer dead . From dust we come from dust we return
Perfeitos! ❤🤟🏽
Meu favorito e o flea ele q me encentivou a tocar baixo

Love you!!!!❤❤❤

HAHAHAHAHAHAA QUERO FEEDAR O DUDUZAC
Yeah Chad Smith and those shitty drum plans are back !
Just....FUCK yes
Ta loco...Anthony
Unfassbar gut!
There's my John bringing back the band I love and need so much ♥️
No.
Os caras são incansáveis...os únicos vivos até hj
Are they gonna play the songs from Josh-era? 🤔
omg i missed RHCP really much. their songs are always from another dimension 😍💫💫
Los extrañaba lamentablemente en México ni en latam no llegarán estos dioses
RHCP = LOVE
i got into rock lately and now I'm discovering RHCP and I genuinely love it, they are truly amazing!!
glad to hear a long gone familiar voice
клип конечно на отъебись сделан,но с песней все вместе выглядит очень хорошо
Keidas song writing hasn't improved in 30 years its insane
This song gave me so much nostalgia that i started to cry. It brings back so many memories of these living legends, from the "snow" guitar leak at the beginning to the californication-like video. And of course the return of the legend himself, John Frusciante. Man, i love RHCP
John fruciante! Welcome back!!
i miss the 90s this isn't it
👌
Fcking tramendus
https://youtu.be/xq8LRIYTwys
Crazy! John is actually back!?! Last I heard that didnt workout
Can't wait to hear this song in the concert
My red hot brothers/tutors are looking and sounding younger than ever. Such a Good vibe. Almost makes me wanna cry. Let's hear the rest of the album. All is right in thr universe
É hit!
Verse and solo is 7-8/10, chorus is a bit lacking 5-6/10.  I hold them to high standards
I like  how he says "dark" in "dark side of the moon"
Wowww bravazo tengo 20 otra vez la misma esencia , la misma bella voz .
Aw crap, time caught us all... nice song dude
Fruscianteee😭😭✊✊✊✊✊✊❤
is this will ferrel's dad on drums???
это вещь.легенды🤟
Mitici come sempre 🇮🇹
EXCELLENT
Какой же я древний чёрт подери.
I’m so fucking stoked that John is back!!!! He is literally my favorite guitarist in the world, and I’ve missed him in RHCP for too long.   Also, what a great song!
THAT SOLO. JOHNNY IS BACK BABY. THAT RHCP SOUND I LOVED SO MUCH IS BACK
Props! For sure! Music does to better in years! Thankful! I'LL see your there in youtube vídeos!
Amazing
Minha banda fav❤️🤘 amooo🇧🇷
Impressionante como, apesar de tudo, os Chili Peppers conseguem "envelhecer" da melhor forma que poderia ser possível! Parabéns aos caras, e seja bem vindo de volta Mr. John Motherfucker Frusciante! Bota pra fuder nessa porra caralho! Vida longa ao Red Hot!!!!!
HALL OF FAMERS
O homem está de volta! Seja bem vindo John Frusciante!!

You talkin about this summer?
Какой он старый уже) но все же его голос это супер
Nice to see Will Ferrell trying something out side his usual element.
el ponchito de Flea, el bailecito de Antthony, la calma de Chad, y el corito de Jhon !!! me pueden
Agora sim, Vida longa ao Red !!!!
Vengan a México es mi sueño conocerlos
Intro géniale, musique sympa mais c’est quoi ce refrain hors contexte et hors rythme qui vient tout casser
Love it ❤️ welcome back guys , welcome back John 💪
what a beautiful guitar solo right there guys!
adamsın furşi!!!
Beautiful
John is back!!!!!
Anyone else get that in the verses,Anthony is going for an irish vibe? or is it just me?
Poor
Red hot sempre sendo um som único
Keanu Reeves on guitar :P
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🤟🤟🤟
Gostei!!!
The verses sound like Lorde - Mood Ring
Awesome Luar biasa!!
Great song but what's going on with the weird pronunciation of some of the words  'durk side of the moon'. Sounds like he's singing in a comical Irish accent. Still love it though
JOHN..🙌😎 his guitar riffs R what makes this song...WELCOME HOME JOHN..🎶I've been waiting..🎶🌈❤
Here we go again, Will Ferrel come back! Hahaha
Nice try, Keanu Reeves. We know that’s you!
Hey.... What does... My Greta weighs a ton mean?

It's not your first time here...
2022 still alive
L'assolo magistrale  di John, l'energia del basso di Flea, il ritmo incalzante della batteria di Chad la personalità magnetica di Anthony. Che dire? I magnifici 4! Lo spirito dei  RHCP non muore mai. Amici nella vita e sul palco. Inossidabili. Irriducibili. Chapeau!!! 🙂
someone in 2022?
John wick on guitar 😍
US RHCP FANS KNOW....ONCE JOHN IS BACK, THE ALBUM IS GONNA BE LIT!!!!! I'm so happy the fantastic four are back at it again.
RHCP
💥((🔥⥎🔥))💥
Как я рад видеть в клипе опять Джона!!!!!! Клип отличный,песня шикарная,ну плохое вы делать так и ненаучились))))))
Guitar solo great...the rest is pretty dodgy to be honest...
love u
It sounds a little like goose. And Anthony is Irish?
Simplemente ame la canción, me ha quedado un gustó tan placentero 😌 Pero especialmente estoy aquí por ese espectacular solo de John. Gracias hombre por volver... De nuevo 🤟🏻🖤
フルシャンテ、さすがだね。
Thank you for sharing your gifts Des Chéris   🔥☯️🔥
This band still has it ,they are legend,  can't believe John will comeback after he left after SA Era, love them always!
It's been a long time Red Hot Chili Peppers 🤘🏻😄
The Band perfect.
Lirik nya kaka . . . . .  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
So I read this song is about climate change and the black summers are about the Forrest fires in Australia. I guess though you could also think of black summer as the covid lockdown summers we have had to endure but either way I’m loving the new music 🎸
The RHCP feel complete again.
Hard to believe they started writing songs 40 years ago...still doing the craft at a high level! Very inspiring!
RHCP really bring me back to nostalgic of massive stadium concert vibe kinda sad song but so ready to sing along and head bang with closed eyes.
I'm hyped now. Cant wait for the album :D
John is the Keanu Reeves of Music btw.
Im back for you guys. Thanks John!
OLAĞAN  ÜSTÜSÜNÜZ ...
Can't believed Will Farrel is playing the drums.
Бицуха кидиса клас соло фру оргазм песня хуета я царь
Definitely a better version of RHCP than the other 2 albums
Amaziinngg quality has never dropped)
Frusciante 😍
17M views in just 2 weeks. 👌
Its okay ig. They were definitely trying to go for there old sound which is cool but its too mainstream for me
Can't quite figure out if he is going for Native American or Folk Irish in his cadence for the first two verses, from the chorus on its standard chilli peppers, but something is different about the first half of the song. Anyone think the same?
Смотрю MTV как обычно, меняю подгузник как обычно.. тут слышу, знакомая гитара.. поворачиваюсь, а это ВЫ!!!!!!😍 не могу перестать слушать❤
Is it me or has he developed an Irish accent 🤔😆
The look as if They've done a lot of drugs in their youth
Why am I crying ???
🔥🔥🔥
You guys are still the shit! Keep rockin!
Didn’t know Joe Exotic was out recording new songs again
My new fav. I'm sure I seen tiger king & Will Ferrell though. Irrelevant. The music is tripple A. Love em!
What a amazing band I dream of seeing these people in concert
When it comes to Rock bands I think that there is a rule everybody will have to live life of percussion player and everybody already lived life of singer, happy saturday!!!
I like this new one  a lot more than I thought I would. Good Job Chili Willies! Good to have Frusciante back.
Welcome Home John !!! Didn't think I'd ever c him play wit them again !! Warms my Heart ❤️
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I been waitin' I been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Wooooooooooooooou! Ya extrañaba verlos así como en los 90 y 2000, con esa maestría. Cada vez mejores con los años. 💛
After the first listen or two this one didn’t blow me away, but it’s a pretty good one not gonna lie. I’m excited to hear the new album April 1st.
wellcomeback john
Finally, I feel the real RHCP again...
Wack.
Been loving you guys for 30 years.. Keeping it real.. And funky.. Bless
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
The most excited ive Been in years, absolute living legends. 🙌
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

These guys don’t age still Rockin !Anthony Kedis is still in great shape .Fan  for life been listening to this guys since I was a teen 💪🏽👍🏽❤️
Good.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They're Eternal
como se hace para darle tantos me gusta como sea posible!!! larga vida a los Red Hot Chilli Peppers
this song is fire tf
Best song i ever heard. Normali im from hip hop rap. But this is genius!. Speciale 2.50 de hardcore sound tha shitt wow love IT micro differents rap/rock .(the drummer)
Me headbanging on a jam made by a bunch of middle aged men.*  Happiness.
At 1:52 this song takes a warp drive to another level!!!!!
Honestly, I’m just as happy about Anthony sounding good as I am frusciante being back. It’s well known that Anthony hasn’t always been a very good singer.
Achar essa música boa e não entender nada de música mesmo como maioria dos brasileiros. Música fraca. Não passam de um bando de baba ovo quem  gostou
A soul playing a guitar

What did he smoke that made him have an Irish accent? 😶‍🌫️🍁🌚
This is the first song they’ve released that I absolutely despise, complete garbage, should of just retired if they think this is a good song
Kinda weak… not gonna lie. By their standards, which are really effin high, this is kinda rehashed crap. Don’t get me wrong, weak Peps is better than most bands good days, but I expect more from them.
🔥
Dale Darioo cantaaa
So many Stadium Arcadium vibes, Rick Rubin is a legend
With all due respect to Josh, but Frusciante is just on another level. He completes the band!
I didn't know john wick was in your band
RHCP is the only band that has never swayed from their style. Thank you guys SO much for all of us lifetime fans!
Summer of 2020 felt like "black summer" to me - the pandemic, the demonstrations, all the pain
No tiene 1 segundo de desperdicio! Por Dios! 🌶❤
Yessss!! I love it! 🎶💋🔥🌶️🎶
John is back 😎🙌
Con la magia intacta desde el 83 😎🙌
Pqp,pqp, o som da guitarra dos 45seg até os 55 é perfeito !!!!! Incontestável o som do Red Hot ...
Seketika berasa mudah lg 😁 Feel young again 😋
So awesome to see this has continued to get so many views but also kinda sad that some of their other amazing older stuff has much less
I can't even describe how happy I am that John is back!!!  We missed you so much bro❤❤❤
My greta or my crater weighs a ton?
Creí que Diego Verdaguer había muerto...
Super dope!
Frusciante’s band.

Can Keidis give Bob Belcher from Bob's burgers his moustache back?
The guitar solo is outta this world
Por Deus não consigo parar de assistir Black Summer Todos os Dias....minha vida REDHOTCHILIPEPPERS
quiero tener 59 años y verme como Anthony jaja
😍😍😍😍 amooooo essa música
What the fuck why are the comments full of Spanish bishes trying to sell their sex businesses
I love the power between John and Flea, but Anthony and Flea have been brothers since the beginning and love to see their bond. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy
Пересматриваю уже в сотый раз!! Как домой вернулся!
Why does Anthony keep cutting his hair?
saya merindukanyaaaa
I like Frusciante Jimi hendrix style awesome
Antony's voice never gets old? Beautiful stuff guys.
RHCP... my longtime love ❤‍🔥
That moustache has its own congressman. I love it !
Está bastante bien el tema, aunque el estribillo no me acaba de entrar. Pero sólo por la parte de Frusciante ya merece la pena.
There better then a lot of new bands even after all these years
Os melhores sempre 👏👏👏👏🙏💚💚
Que bueno que regreso Jhon, que gran banda!!!!
The more I listen to it, the more I like it
Yeeeaaaaahhhh welcome back! Incredible Band- sound!  We are so happy to listen you!♥️♥️

FLEA ES EL DIOS DEL BAJO

Uhuuuuuu.... black Summer very crazy man's , love music 😍 good job Brothers 🙅🏻💥💥💥🤙🏻🇧🇷💞
It makes me so happy to see John in this music video. The feel and sound that he brings to the peppers is genuinely amazing.
Can you believe we were Frusciante-less for 15 years?
Ребята, ВЫ моя любовь......!!!Это круто!
the kings are back!
Goddamm John is so good with that faqn guitar.
Why does he have no teeth?
Can't wait to the world tour..
My sister loves these guys I'm a disco hip hop girl I never knew what she liked about them ... years later I get it.. legends!  Rock on Sis my life would be empty without you! 30 years at the Hard Rock God knew exactly where to put you!
Rockin the mullet

Powerful divine beings just vibing out with the cosmos  ✨️
The guitar solo reminds me so much on "I'm not like evrybody else" from The Kinks. Great vibe!

Again and again !!!
Poor Aniki.
I love the Chili Peppers, but this is shit.
Шедевр! Розумію, що до ранку не витримаю дивитись в повторі 221 раз, сон мене переможе...
Frusciante é a cara do Chili Peppers. Obrigado por voltar, monstro!
Great song. Welcome back guys. Missed you.
Fruscinte viejo y peludo nomá....😎
❤️🇮🇩
Boss this can’t wait to see yous! And for their ages they look fabulous!
Not sure where the Irish accent came from 😄
Avril Lavigne's new album comes out February 25th, including songs featuring Machine Gun Kelly, Blackbear, Travis Barker and Mark Hoppus (Blink 182) 🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back John..hell yes..
How come I did not find this 2 weeks ago? 😲  Simply amazing! This is just amazing!
Anthony 💛
Too bad they took the blood oath.
Frusciante, eu te venero 😍... Que retorno, meus amigos!
É como voltar 15 anos no tempo
top
Brilliance! 🙌🤘🐺
Damn they never change! Same old coolness!
The song is great but the video looks like from another totally different song.
I FREAKIN' LOVE YOU GUYS. LONG LIVE TO FRUSCIANTE AND TO ALL THE RED HOT CHILI 🌶️🌶️
Love me some 🌶 did they get a new guitars since their tendency album????
Eddie Guerrero didn't die. He started a band
con Frusciante... esto si suena a RHCP
Thanks for this great song again 😁😁 de love RHCP we can feel some hendrix inspiration in this song that amazing thank you john frusciante
When will they play it live for the first time?
Uma chuva preguiçosa eu sou Os céus se recusam a chorar A cremação leva o pedaço destinado do seu suprimento  A noite está vestida como o meio-dia Um marinheiro falou cedo demais E a China está do lado escuro da Lua (Me ouça)  Os ornitorrincos são poucos A vida secreta dos cangurus Uma celebridade que eu não conhecia (Pega aí)  Minha cratera pesa uma tonelada O arqueiro está fugindo E ninguém fica sozinho atrás do Sol  Faz muito tempo desde que fiz um novo amigo Esperando que outro verão sombrio termine Já faz muito tempo e você nunca sabe quando Esperando que outro verão sombrio termine  Apoie o chicote flamejante Estão navegando na nossa censura Montando num cavalo sem cabeça para fazer a viagem  Faz muito tempo desde que fiz um novo amigo Esperando que outro verão sombrio termine Já faz muito tempo e você nunca sabe quando Esperando que outro verão sombrio termine  Eu tenho esperado Eu tenho esperado Esperado que outro verão sombrio termine  Eu tenho esperado Eu tenho esperado Esperado que outro verão sombrio termine  Eu tenho esperado Eu tenho esperado Esperado que outro verão sombrio termine
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
🍻FRUSCIANTE😎
love this song. RHCP never getting older. They are like  fine wine.
John ❤❤❤❤
Sonzeira. Os Reds estão cada vez melhores!
Fucking hate it! It's not ReD HoT anymore!!!!
Orgulho de ser fã! ❤️ #RHCP
At firtst I was like meh. Now I can‘t stop listening.
I'm a metal head through and through and the Chili Peppers are in my top 5 favorite bands.
Do they know how bad this is and just don’t care anymore?! What am I missing?
I've made home vids of my dog on my iphone in blk/white that are leaps and bounds more artistic than this. What is it w/HOLLYWOOD? YOU HAVE 4 LITERAL ARTISTS in your band and this is the video you come up with? Star Wars 26?
Este solo me recuerda al de i could have lied en budokan, mismo sonido de la guitarra
Keren bang walaupun udah pada tua tapi tetep enerjik wkwk😹
Nice tone started... than Flea guitar with a portrat of the jerk who organized mass murders. Turned off.
Biggest RH fan out there (i got the tattoo) So...This is the worst vid. I've seen in my 39 yrs. I HATE FAKE HOLLYWOOD GREEN SCREEN VIDEOS. 4 LITERAL artists are in your band...Picture if you will 4 artists in a room, blk/white a bit of them talking about the take/song/parts then recording it live together...And cut. Jesus. I can do this on an iphone for almost free
I'm a bigger fan of #RHCP than anyone I know of. (tattoos to prove it) THIS MAY BE THE WORST VIDEO I'VE SEEN IN MY 39 YEARS. THIS AIN'T STAR WARS (and star wars sucks) anyway
I,m waited for long long time.but when I time this song , my brain rebirth your earth.
trop bien merci
fera demais slk👍
Они вернулись!
Volvió la mágia! Volvió la alquimia! Esos coros!
longa vida a voces
It is impossible to steal this essence, because we are the Essenzen ❤✌🤟🧚🧜‍♀️🤴👸👄🙌🙏💫😻👽☠😇
Es un temazo. John Frusciante is a fucking god at guitar.
ah yes, slow cheetah 2.0
The old quality is black! Yeah!
@2.50 RHCP together again..:)
DAMN! That solo ! my jaw dropped when I first heard it.
¡Vuelvan a Perú! Come back to Peru! ❣
Amaziiiinng
hear new guitar sound.
Heard this song on a radio for the first time. I knew right away that was RHCP. So unique and always loyal to their essense.
Let me be your Producer🔥🔥
Most definitely a RHCP song they dont stray much from the original recipe gotta respect that!!
Welcome back Anthony, Flea, Chad, especially you John !
ALL TIME FAV's!!! You can't beat the Chili's with a stick! 😍😍
El ritmo inicial dr la bateria es la misma que californication o soy yo?
all signs of baphomet in one clip
I love them so much <3
Definitely waiting for the divisive black summer to end. Not matter who you are, where you come from and what you believe we are all one on this earth. Being at effect of fear, shame, judgement of  others and ourselves will perpetuate a longer black summer.    I love being in my heart space. That is the message of this song. Find your own abundance within yourself and shine that out to the world. All we need it LOVE. NOT MADNESS.
Esse é o Red Hot que a gente gosta
Can't wait till 22nd June to see them live in Manchester uk
FUCK YEEEEEE!!!
Керемет RHCP👍
MAGNIFIQUE !   The red hot chili peppers !
Frusciante?? 🤩
Mannnnnn.  This band is soooo freaking Amazing. Style never gets old.
17million views in 2 weeks and this song is mediocre at best. It shows the power of nostalgia
This karate master pornstar sounds kind of like Anthony Kiedis
So I don't really keep up on like the news or anything but I could tell immediately that John Frusciante was back from the very first note
La clásica formula
La amo!!! No puedo parar de escucharla
Can't get enough of this! Will still for many years to come. This is music, unlike the crap of this days.
Always good👌
They perform so good as always
Lagi nyari orang indo👇👇
I swear, it sounds like John came back one day and said "OK guys, I'm ready to finish Stadium Arcadium disc 3" - And I love it.
Cuanto más la escucho más me gusta 🐙🎸🤘✳🌶🖤❤
Cool
O tempo passa e os caras continuam intactos , slk muito bom!
Classic
Ok dis is cool

Son únicos, unos genios
10/10! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Will Farrel playin mad drums
A Music Video in original Red Hot Chili Peppers style.
Back on TRACK John Frusciante. Welcome Back RHCP! Glad to see you John Frusciante!
Thanks for your music, carry on love from India
this guy is almost 60...
Kereeen
You can tell you know who is back but well done to the whole band I can't stop listening looking forward to the album guys
Frusciante's guitar awesomeness is what the world needs right now...no kidding!!
Hearing this immediatly reminded me of load and reload era metallica
UNLIMITED LOVE (APRIL 1)
Best effort since under the bridge.... One hell of a guitar solo in the middle. 10/10
Anthony Kiedis' physique puts men half his age, heck one-third of his age, to shame. Guy's a beast!
wap wap wap
you are the best
Red hot chilli peppers Still kickin'. Rock on!... honestly. Awesome.
@0.47 on my little phone screen im like WTF JOHN WICK (Keanu xD) haha
Sheesh..
Can’t believe him hearing a new John solo 😭
It feel sooooo home to me with RHCP , baggy shirt with fender guitar,a shirt less frontman , bald guy with bass and Will ferrell on drumms 😍😍😍😍😍😍

john frusciante chili peppers 🔥🔥🔥
Awesome
Flea is a god on earth
super, simply cool video with great music
glad john frusciante is back!
Long life RHCP!
Fleas smile at 0.45 is pure joy
ಈ ಹಾಡು ನನ್ನ ಕಾಲೇಜ್ ದಿನಗಳನ್ನ, ನನ್ನ ಕ್ಯಾಸೆಟ್ ವಾಕ್ಮ್ಯಾನನ್ನ ನೆನಪಿಸ್ತಿದೆ... ಕ್ಯಾಲಿಫೋರ್ನಿಕೇಶನ್ ಅಂತೂ ವಾಕ್ಮ್ಯಾನ್ ರೀವೈಂಡ್ ಬಟನ್ ಕೆಟ್ಟೋಗೋವರೆಗೂ ಕೇಳಿದ್ದೆ
Ieri come oggi... grazie RHCP
Koyaanisqatsi
F yeah! Peppers are back baby
Forevs game-tight!
LOOK ITS EDDIE GUERERO
Wanna know what makes this so awesome to me, I grew up with my dad always playing rhcp and I never see what they look like. I saw this as a commercial and instantly typed in the name and saw this and got so hyped lol. I love these guys
Оставаться собой и при этом оставаться в тренде, вот где талант. Песня - кайф.
tremendos los platillos del minuto 3:33
This song kick's ass... it's just too damn good!!! Keep it up RHCP!!! Y'all keep my flame burning hot and bright 🔥🔥🔥, always be a Red Hot Chili Pepper!!!
nice havent heard them in years , they still have it. beautiful!!!!!!🖒🖒🖒
This is what music needs right now. The bands from the 80s to 2010s to start making music again. Modern music is just whiney, bland, and bad.
I'm glad - John is back. One and only guitar man RHCP. Can't wait full album!
Anyone else seeing RHCP on tour Summer 2022? Got my tickets today. The Strokes and Thundercat opening.
So glad I watched this......now I'm going to see them in concert!!!
Growing  growing growin' grows on yah!   Total curtain almost opening teaser!    If it curves you into bad mood world, then, umm, you might have other things you wanna address.....Stay Cool!!!
🖤
Chingada madre!! Estos si son los Red Hot
Is the lead guitar new.
Yasss. 😍
People are loving John's solo but don't sleep on his outro
remember when keanu kicked ur shit in lol?
Can’t begin to tell y’all how happy I am to be here to witness the comeback of RHCPs. This song has that original RHCP sound to it - which I love and adore, respectfully. I haven’t been this excited for the release of an album in years! 🌶🤘🏾
Love it. Even the Gaelic pub crawl vocals
Joe extoic looks good.
didnt  know keanu reeves could also play the guitar
2:50 amazing🤘🤘🔥
ผมฟังตั้งแต่8ขวบ ตอนนี้32 ตำนานร็อก Red Red hot chili peppers
Eu tô simplesmente viciada nessa música! ❤
John doesn't age... He seems the same as he always has
I heard this wonder with my father he thought it was amazing how each member of the band is nowadays this is one of the moments that I will keep fondly in my memory

anthony no envejece=======YTr/()/$
Love that Breakdown Outro at 3:08  Is it just me our does Chad start singing "I've Been Waiting" at 3:15  I just noticed that lol
Am I the only one feels bad for Josh. I love John but I would have loved too see them have 2 guitarist
cuando homero dijo y seguiré rockeando forever, forever, forever creo que a esto se refería
ohhh dudes.. seeing them live is going to bring tears to my eyes... you don't even know how much some of us have been waiting to see these 4 geniuses back together, faithful to their style
John Frusciante what a legend.
17 million already that’s tour money bro… Fire it up boys!!! 🤙😎🇺🇸 🔥🔥🔥🔥 and don’t skip Nebraska please and thank you.
Que sean eternos..
Ugh that mustache 😩
Anthony stole my mullet! Viva La Raza!!!
🙏🙏🙏
Love the RHCP😈🌶
So glad John is back!
Very cool visuals, definitely remind me of under the bridge, except they are now using LED panels.
Awesome that John Frusciante is back. They’re just so much better with his guitar style!
Still got that 90s vibe!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏💯💯💯💯
The best fucking band of rock in the history, i love you guys, from Argentina
i love
2:15 That John's melody
Beautiful song, i can't stop listen it

Just another amazing song from the best band in the world
This band can't help but rock the world! I will be at this show, *fo' Show!*
Good to have John back
Can't believe Will Ferrell is the drummer
RHCP 🥰
Fuuuckk im late to the party
In Frusciante I trust….
Nice to see Joe exotic is out of jail and fronting this band.
it's interesting to parallel this video with the under the bridge music video they did back in the day. kinda touching, like a reconfigured ode to that past imagery
Bruh
yesssss
Hairdresser: what you want Anthony: something simple I gotta feed my tigers at noon Hairdresser: say no more fam
Excited to see them this year! Legends
I can wait to see them in Marley Park Ireland. I will be so worth it.  The video to Black Summer is spot on for the lyrics, vocals and spirit of the Band.  1st listen, you guys knocked it out of the park. Well done!
Muito bom ver o John  de volta! !
Literally like John never left. Genuinely looking forward to this album and I haven’t said that in years.
Wtf is with kiedis singing like a newfy sailor?! Lol
Holy shit!  Dude this rocks!
0:49 Muito legal! Na nova Matrix Neo é o guitarrista dos Chilli Peppers!
Brasil curte! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Balthazar Bratt  no vocal RHCP uma das bandas mais produtivas e criativas de todos os tempos Ja ta na bíblia do rock
Güzel olmuş
Как приятно видеть Джона Фрушанто.
Im glad he's back...
still wondering abt the pirate voice
&&im un the state of reading of memoirs &&& of anthoh=ny
tell md smth im gonna laugh
i like his kong fu dance style, classic ;p
Se nota como Jhon le da ese algo que los reds habían perdido, igual Josh siempre será uno de los mejores guitarrista que pudo tocarle al grupo lml
Maybe it'll grow on me.  The sounds don't do much to spark my soul. I am so glad Frusciante's back. Flea sounds amazing too. Chad is tame here. John's vocals were deeply missed. The marry so perfectly with  Kiedis. But the tone of the song doesn't resonate to me. For their last album together, Snow hey-oh and Dani California singles  were full of such passion. I get this is a slower song. But the sounds like a shadow of their old work. Atleast vocally. The layers of the guitar are nice. A part of me would be happy to just have an instrumental album with John's vocals. What a treat that would be. John is incorporating some more electronic elements, which is reflective of his own solo work and that's refreshing.  It's hard for a band to maintain passion after so many years, here's hoping.
Anthony forgot the traditional 4 bars of 'rap'. Soo sad if you know they once made bloodsugar etc.. 😥
давно у них такой вылизанный стерильный звук стал?
The Chili's are always solid but their chemistry with John Frusciante is special.
¡Larga vida Frusciante, larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, impresionante sonido y energía que transmiten, bien hecho!
Oh man these guys are washed up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXl2exeH8tI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS8taasZl8k
Hey! Frusciante is back. Fuck yeah!
Whoooooooo!!! This multiverse has nothing on me baby!! Here's Johhny!!
Thank you 🙏🏻🥺
Melhor de todos
The more i listen to this song and the more i want to listen to it
Perdi as contas de quantas vezes ouvi Black Summer, esperando ansiosamente pelo novo álbum!! O fato do John ter voltado deixou a música ainda mais especial 😩❤️🌶️
Now this is RHCP🔥❤️
⚡⚡⚡🎵🔥💛💛💛🔥🎵⚡⚡⚡
Fantastic. I love them.
but the absolutus gonna eat us all
you are in a good shape^ tony
John frusciante is god
this is kinda beatifull enough but not meaningful
Not impressed with this tune- Hopefully there are better ones on the album
Maravilhoso ..✌😎
O dinheiro pra droga do Frusciante deve ter acabado
He is back 🙏
im gonna hug u with all my love
The more I listen to that solo at 3:08, the more it reminds me Curve - Frozen. Weird.
that was the better age
Forever young motherfuckers
Que perfeitoo😍😍😍
Uma vez um fã no show do John Frusciante disse o seguinte: "Foda-se Anthony Kids" o John Frusciante logo respondeu: "Foda-se você, o Anthony que me ajudou a tá aqui"
You were born to drive you crazy with your masterpieces!
Grateful Dead beat anyone???  Love the song and RHCP. Just found those drums sounding familiar.
i dont think the lead singer has ever not been ripped
John's back and it feels so good.
mas de lo mismo, nada nuevo.
Absolutely love this song. Chili’s are back with a vengeance. Excited for the new album and dreaming of California and younger days
It's ok. The chilli peppers used to be so much more than ok.
My favorite band since I was a teenager. Beyond hype for this album, already getting goosebumps
Doble 9
Ok always been a huge fan of RHCP, but was a little thrown between loving this new song and thinking the video was a character being played by Ben Stiller!
💚😍🥰 Son unos genios 🥰😍💚
It could Be 2022 WWE Summer SLAM theme Song ❤️
JF is an awesome guitarist
Some of the best vocals (and my favorites) were gone recently - Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell. Bono from U2 is getting old .... Fortunately we still have RHCP (with Tony Kiedis as singer). These kind of sound and vocals are needed these days and in the world of music.  Very happy for this song and new album.
As always awesome!
Start,: that's not the red hot.. middle:yes ,it's the red hot chili peppers
this song really grows on you
the world needs you. get us out of this shitty present day music.
_”And no one stands alone Behind the Sun"_  I'm looking at you Hillel! 🐬☀️🌅🌇🎸
Siempre desde mi infancia los escucho, en mi lista de música nunca faltan, y así como yo deseamos que jamás RHCP acaben, acá siempre los esperaremos retornar en Colombia
John Wick na guitarra
These guys are making a run at the top 5 bands of all time. 40 or so years later and still pumping out bangers while avoiding the modern woke bullshit
Forever fking young.
if they gave an Oscar for the clips, then you would have taken it for editing!! who is this man??

Me encanta ver comentarios en distintos idiomas. Los RHCP son universales.
Esta formación (aunque no es la original), siempre han sido y serán la escencia... la más emblematica.  John en comunión con Flea, Anthony y Chad son la química perfecta. 🌶🔥  Sin embargo, no hay que menospreciar la última decada, lo que crearon con Josh Klinghoffer.  Hay grandes joyas que no deberian quedar enterradas o ser infravaloradas. De la misma forma, hay que darle su lugar a One Hot Minute con Dave Navarro. Sin olvidar nunca el trabajo de antaño con Hillel Slovak, Jack Sherman, Jack Irons y Cliff Martínez.  🌟
I love your voice. I miss your sound.
que hinoo
I think we have to face facts that without john this song isnt great
I can play better than their guitar player.
lovelovelove, all is not lost, exiting the dark ages, hope, light, another fight. we ve been waiting for you 4
#1
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Edit: it's so nostalgic to see . I think, as long as he wasn't causing problems which he didn't seem to be, they should've kept Klinghoffer too. They've worked together together before. I'd like to get them working on another instant masterpiece like stadium Arcadeium. That would be amazing.

GOATs are back🔥
diiioooos que buena banda
Frusciante is BACK baby!!!!!!!! Now i cant wait to finally see them play together again in concert this year!
This is the real music. Simply amazing
Ja lekker hoor godverdomme. Hard gaan!
I can't get over how much this song has embedded itself into my DNA.. I feel like it's always been part of the catalog.
Thank you boys.  Fabulous to have new music.  John's sweeping guitar is a soul punch for those needing a lift.  Grateful.  cheers
Unfortunately they sold their soul to the devil
This group is santanic
шикарная вещь...тронула... RHCP    в очередной раз  показали что они легенда рока
O love red ❤️
Sin Frusciante no erais nadie.....
Apaixonada ❤️
You are the best
The goosebumps I got seeing John frusciante at 0:47 :') He inspired me to pick up the guitar!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a coincidence that the most viewed part of this video is the solo from John the modafoquin Frusciante! LOVE YOUUUUU
Que temazo no alas gerras no ala destrucion del planeta✊🏼
aguante los chillikota!!!!
You guys are back... Awesome...
I didnt know Will Ferrell was the drummer for RHCP....
i like this song!
Essa parte é muito boa do flea 0:40
what is old age? 🔥
This band never change their music.. And yet many people love them.. Applause..
OLD BUT GOLD🔥🔥🔥
Never fail to impress
Anthony look a like ninja without mask ;v
Your voice 🤩.. please make a song with joanna newsom !! 🙌
Wow, I can't believe Anthony appears on a videoclip without his shirt on.
I cried the first time listening🥺 stadium arcadium album 2.0❤️❤️🥺
eles esbanjam energia, slk
Check out my cover of this song! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwjDJoiNkI
Meua Migo. O fino do fino.
I freaking LOVE bands aging just like fine wines
Wellcome back RHCP 🇮🇩❤️🇮🇩
Anthony looks like one of the Chuckle Brothers, if you live in the uk you’ll know what I mean.
🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿👍👍👍кайф
COOLLLLL❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤
It's incredible, hearing this it's like John never took a hiatus from the band. This could be a bonus track from Stadium. I'm so excited to hear the rest of the album
Wow
Cuanta emoción verlos juntos de nuevo!!!!!! Con una canción increíble, siempre fieles a ustedes! ❤️ Gracias por esto!!!
Es como si se hubiesen reunido los dioses del Olimpo!!!
All I care about is John Frusciante is back on guitar and holy shit just wow
Hendrix style guitar psychedelic
Es muy bueno ver a la banda con Jhon Frusciante de vuelta, la canción me gusta pero se me hace un poco similar a las del álbum Californication, es como si fuera un track perdido de aquél álbum, no me quejo, solo digo que suena bastante a ésa época así que igual me encanta. Siempre voy a bancar a RHCP, los sigo desde adolescente y ahora ya de grande cuando me enteré que le hacían el aguante a BabyMetal llevandolas de teloneras en su gira los adoro aún más. Que sigan los éxitos para ésta banda que sabe entregar buena música. 🦊🤘❤️
Aus den Helden meiner Jugend sind richtige Opas geworden. Schön, dass John noch lebt - und wieder dabei ist....  😊
Oh this guitar gives me chills. Thanks John.
è tornato Big John......... basta questo......... e a Firenze manca sempre meno
Russia love rhcp
10x RHCP! U R N1!
less compression on the vocals next time please
Смотрю уже в 19 раз и никак не могу оторваться. Ребята вы лучшие!!!! Очень жду альбом! Upd: посмотрел уже раз 25, а сколько прослушал нисчесть. Альбом вышел но к сожалению в России без ВПН не послушать:_(
Wellcome home john I wish they have 2 guitarists at the same time John and josh
They still hot as chilli peppers
Não gostei. Bem chata.
finally back!!
Saya tau lagu ini dari guitar flash mobile
They are still good 👍🌶️🔥
Gw suka lagu barunya,Suasana lagu ini berasa nostalgia jaman gw masih main guitar Hero PS 2 ❤️
Good song
Uma das minhas bandas preferida,amei esse solo do Jhon 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘🤘🎸🎸🎸🎸🇧🇷🇧🇷
Viva Frusciante. Love to see him back! Great song, guys! 🔥🔥
Strange…why he reminds me of Ben Stiller
It's a great pleasure to see you back Sir Frusciante.
Love the californicationish snare tone!
It's a nice clip, don't get me wrong, but what's with the unplugged guitars/bass? It hits me every time and I can't oversee it! Plus, a couple of big lush amplifiers and some shiny pedals could look really sexy, no? (and believable)
アンソニーはカッコいいと思ってんのか知らんけど 髪伸ばせ！ スーパーマリオやないかーい！
Господь услышал мои молитвы - Джон вернулся ! :)
no one gonna talk about the funny accent anthony’s in this song?
Love this song. The timing of it's release, at the end of the pandemic and the lyrics is just perfect.
Finally 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😙
Very nice 😊
Just so cool - always and forever
I have listened only a couple of RHCP songs before. But I'm addicted to this song. Have listened at least 25 times by now
Best song for 2022. Loving it.
After so many years they still have their unique sound...
Well, I'm so happy to hear something new from Red hots and I'm excited to see Frusciante back! My expectations are really high!! Only pitty that new song reminds me my favorite song from Katie Melua https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8iE9e0uTzs Hope that rest of the album will be more interesting :)
UGGGGHHH Anthony still a damn meal ☠️
Отличные ребята, спасибо за музыку!!! привет из России!)©
Hello John! 🧡
waah band terpaporit ini !!!
Although the return to Neptune is dope, I was digging the Jupiter vibe of The Getaway.
Let’s go RHCP
How powerful are RHCP🤩,  peoples from all over the world, sharing the same old but gold memories. This song take me 20 years back....i love it
Foda pra carai!👏👏👏👏
Tune.
Love you guys xxxx
My favorite song at the moment. Very good
Good song but what's with his accent lol
If you guys close your eyes and imagine 1991 , Is the kind of feeling that is blood sugar sex magik time again.
Wow Best music is back 🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴
Frusciante brings his distinctive powerful tone back..as he should as on of the best guitarists of the last 30 years. His lead is literally the only reason I like this song. But I'm not really feeling the lyrics or song writing...or the chorus a whole lot. It kinda sounds ad-libbed or like Kiedis just used a rhyming generator, lol..
damn this group never old, crazy !
¡Welcome back, John!
Grité cuando oí y vi a John, me encanta que regresara y me encanta la canción C:
ha sido un placer escuchar de nuevo la música de RHCP. Nunca cambiarán su sonido único y energía que transmiten. Saludo desde Corea del Sur. Los animaré para siempre!!
I miss Rock n Roll...
John fruciante nyawa dari RHCP , respect 🎸
Didn't know Joe Exotic got released and became the front man?!?! On a serious note this is great, super groovy!!
this sounds like an AI generated chilli peppers song
Hey its Skinny Eddie Guerrero, no disrespect Anthony Kiedis. Thanks for bringing back the good memories on times past. Catch you on the flip side. Perhaps on the mountain... You know which one, See you there.
Just how good is this song , lyrics are just AMAZING. Can't wait for the album to come on..I've been waiting on a new RHCP Album👍👍😁
this makes me feel like playing an electric guitar and killing ppl like that brat with a weird hairstyl- (gets beat to death )
You lost there Arthur Shelby mate? 😄
Amazing song. Though the video is a little simple, bet they spent most of the money just to get the Will Ferrell Cameo
This is a great song . I FUCKING LOVE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 🌶
Awesome to see John shred with this band again. His favorite band as a young man. That formula they have down is nostalgic but repetitive and stale. John's solo stuff can be amazing though.
John is back.... it's about damn time.
Una vez mencione que las bandas nunca deben perder su esencia.  Que bueno que no me equivoque.  Las bandas pueden evolucionar sin perder su esencia.  Esto es lo que distingue a la buena música. Puedes jugar con algunos ritmos pero sin dejar que esos ritmos se coman tu esencia.
melhor que fresno!!!
increíble como una banda puede tener tener un sonido tan reconocible y propio, suena como si fuera una canción de su primer álbum, y aun así tiene evolución y mejor calidad
I'm biggest dream is to meet you guys. You always help me though hard times and celebrate the good times. You guys been big part my life and when u release this new song I broke down in tears. Tears of joy, peace, like see my long lost friends. Thank you for being you I love you guys so much and I hope one day to meet all of and thank you for always being there for me and comforting me there life. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!!
Somehow this gives me phineas and ferb vibes
Thank you, thank you so much thanks, for not doing regueton
Awesome. Sounds great, welcome back, John. I always hoped you'd come back yet again and it was looking like it wasn't going to happen, but then out of the blue, it happened.   I'm glad they released a more chill song first too. Gets to show off their chemistry with each other, which seems like not a day has passed at all. Looking forward to what these sessions created.
God I love yalllllllll this sh!t amazing 👏
🥱🥱🥱boring And I have been a huge fan for 30 years so that is super hard for me to say. Waiting for the funk.
I’m really digging the Danzig meets Magnum PI vibe. With Frusciante they’re at their mightiest.
Sounds like home.
Kembali lagi red hot chili peppers ku yang dulu❤
Red hot religion peppers
More I listen the more I like. Mellow tune with a Red Hot groove
ROCK IS NOT DEAD
❤️🇧🇷
Is he fucking Irish now?
excelent
Frusciante with Jimi's roots
Great new song, can't wait to buy this album.
Yeah!!! Frusciante is back!!!!!!!
Damnnnnn
Powerful and beautiful. Nice to see John.
vamos los peppers!!!
love it
Man. It is soooo good to see fruciante (sorry if I fucked your last name up bro) back with the peppers. Josh was good but my gawwddddd they sound soooo good and so much like the peppers we know and love with him on guitar. Can't wait for this album to come out!!! Oh man this brings me joy so much tears of joy!!!!! Fuck yessss!! Long live RHCP!
❤it
Great to hear this after their last album, which was piss poor...
His pronouncement of certain words are weird in this song
lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon, And China's on the dark side of Moon...
Not perfect but almost. So refreshing to hear a solid song w little auto-tune or fakeness. Feels so natural. That alone is a reason to support this band again.
I feel like I just licked the belly of a toad watching this video
only 16 millions
This is like a dream you can’t believe, but it’s really true
Good to see will Ferrell back
Amazing song...
Antony con un look a lo Diego verdaguer
John Frusciante ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok I'm ready for more now!! Haha. This has been on repeat for the last 5 days.
The skies have rained birds foe you.
Looking at these album titles for the upcoming album of the Red Hot chili peppers I most want to hear Veronica
Nunca pude verlos en vivo pero esperaré que algún día vuelvan a México
Just WOW!
Gonna buy this album as soon as it drops I can’t wait 😝
Anthony kiedis is the new Diego Verdaguer😁
The first time I heard this, I could have sworn he sang, "vaginas on the dark side of the moon".🤣
It sounds like an auto tuned sea shanty
https://youtu.be/KWyJrklp-WE
muy bueno, AL FIN!!!! Algo de musica dios, que nostalgia me viene estas lyrics grande Red hott i lovv thisss
Thanks for not dying John.
The definition of Timeless is right here thanks to those legends.
I am hearing RHCP's song since I was 12 years old, love this song
Can't tell what FX they've got on the vocals, almost a Scottish or Norse twang, weird. The instrumental isn't the usual, doesn't seem authentic but it's something new for sure. Maybe they lost the top producers, not looked into it but it ain't sounding much like Rick. Just got to the fruciante solo and it sounds much better. Glad too see them back with new gear 🔥💯 ScotlandsBest🙏 - 🤲LegendarySurvivor3x 🎯💣
Cried to hear John Solo. Its been a while we heard it. Touched my soul.
Yo Anthony Kiedis can fucking get it
Love this
John John John. John with a mustache. John in the sky. John in a forest. John behind a battery. Sorry i suffer from "Frusciante" decease. Can't wait to see them in Paris. 3 third time in 20 years. How times flies.
meu pai iria adorar essa musica... estou ouvindo por você pai ♥
Me gusta!
Us chili heads are the loyalist fans ever .. great tune
Eu sou o comentário em português que vc estava procurando
Bienvenido Frusciante
So no one was going to tell me there was some new RHCP music out?????
ahhh se siente ese vibe RHCP - Frusciante
20M let's go!
Rhcp è un'onda che ritorna e ci travolge tutti col loro sound magico! Bentornati!
God Frusciante ❤
I know John is getting a lot of attention and I'm glad for it but man Chad and Flea are a tight unit!
Anthony try the style of Freddie Mercury !?
So needed this!!!~~~~
Rick Ruben the producer said that this will have a stadium arcadium' ish sound. I'm down
So glad John is back. The Chili Peppers are  just not the same without him. Shout out to Dave & Josh. Being John's replacement is a hard shoe to fill. So hard that he always finds his way back. And then all is right in the world.
Don Caballero with Mayo
JAJA EL VIGOTEEEE
This is RHCP !
Musik beneran ini..
Coisa boa de ser ouvir
jesus!...hell of a sound! :)
psychic spies from china try to steal your minds elation chinas on the dark side of the moon..
This video...I have so many questions...
I really love this song very very much by Red Hot Chili Peppers
Arthur Shelby can sing
YO WHAT TEH FUCK? THEY DIDNT MENTION CALIFORNIA OR ANY PLACES IN CALFORNIA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WHAT IS THIS BULL SHIT? DID THEY SELL OUT? NOT ONE CALIFORNIA OR ALABAMA WHAT TEH FUCK? THEIR ARISTIC VISION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED! MIKE PATTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT THESE GUYS. THEY DIDNT EVEN YELL ONE "SHOPPING CART ESCALATOR!" REALLY DISAPPOINTED. ILL BE MOVING TO THE EAST COAST BECAUSE OF THIS.
Nice natural sound, not too polished. 60's hippie vibe guitars. Good for a first listen, wonder if it will grow
thx RHCPs for this amazing birthday gift!
That Frusciante solo though...
Feels like high school again. Dont know how but it feels like home. Frusciante you are one of kind🤍
Eh o Frusciante?  Esse Jonh que bom back to back
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Wooooooooooowwwww!!!! Saludos desde MÉXICO.
que buena canción la puta madre
I would sell my soul and give my life just to watch their performance. They always have and always will be my all time favourite. They are all the reasons I love music.
anthony se parece a los del patio, la sub21 del marginal
Gosh it's been so long I'm glad to hear some new music from you guys
¡Red Hot Chili Peppers son un grupo fuera de serie!
Top. Linda música. Arranjos perfeitos. Brasil
Gibt es da endlich schluss mit stupidity?
Nothing creative here again by RHCP, next!
con madres el poncho o zarape del bajista
Please come to México!
Still til this day you guys never disappoint! =) Love the guitar solo!
This song has been on every RHCP album of the last 25 years.
Los amo como la primera vez que los escuché, tenía 9 años, hoy tengo 30 y me han acompañado siempre, quiero verlos en México! Nada me haría más feliz que verlos alguna vez en vivo. Vengan por favor!! ❤️
Frusciante is back in da house... The light is shining to the future.
🌶🌶
Música de verdad, con el regreso de Frustiante, nada que ver con la basura de Bad Bunny
He should rethink this mustache

This has old school peppers vibes
❤️
Even whithout to know the Frusciante's return, is felt the Frusciante influency
still fucking dopeeeeeee
Песня - проходнячек, но Иисус снова с нами, а значит, надежда есть!
ca faisait longtemps que les red hot nous avaient pas pondu un bijou pareil leur grand retour
Pensé que había muerto Diego Verdaguer
Is Anthony Kiedis actually turning 60 this year?
RHCP are awesome! John Frusciante is amazing  1:52
Muy buena
Amo a los red hot pero siento que esto es más de lo mismo, parece que hubieran agarrado 2 o 3 hits viejos y los hubieran mezclado en una canción, no me paso absolutamente nada, solo quiero destacar el hermoso solo de john
RIP JOSH 😠
LOVE YOU GUYS ♥️
Kiedis went straight up mullet man on this track.. yeo
dobra rhcp wraca
Precisamos de uma petição pro Anthony nunca mais usar camiseta
They’ve done it again... AWESOME!!! 🐐
horrible
What a great song!! You are the best guys, my absolute favorite since the 80’s !!!
*goes back to listening to One Hot Minute*
Damn, the guitar by John here is amazing. And for coming up on 60 years old, Anthony Kiedis is in damn good shape.
Que banda que nunca valio un carajo
Feeling the same when I heard Californication for first time. Thank you RHCP! Best band on the world!
lagu & melodinya enak bgt, nggak sabar nunggu album barunya.. great job RHCP
Se passaram tantos anos e eles continuam com a mesma qualidade musical ❤🙏🏻
Respect 👍❤️
MEU DEUS EU AMO VOCÊS RED HOT
Sounds like red hot chilli peppers,I'm not sure it's a good thing or bad thing.
That guitar solo is the sweetest i've heard in 2022.
China is on the Dark Side of the Moon. Im glad John Frusciante is back. Can't wait for the new album April 01.
30 years later and he sounds the exact same!!!! Unreal
Que buen guitarrista es Keanu Reeves
Frusciante is back. I never thought I'd see this.
This is true RHCP experience. Vibe is the same all times. Love it :)
Imagining listening to this song at FIRENZE rocks, with the sunset behind and 40 degrees on my shoulders. Living for this moment.
like david bowie..
Welcome back guys
😭😭😭😭👇 https://youtu.be/AOxBf8Gudx8
its only me or this music is 100% HENDRIX vibes on guitar notes!?
This song makes me feel alive, makes me travel back in time when I was a kid and started listening RHCP. I feel alive!!! thanks Red Hot Chili Peppers
Waiting for Californication 2.0... ooops, Unlimited Love ;)
Will Ferrell rocking those drums!!
Unduly ruly baby!!!https://youtu.be/S3PXgYKCnwE
Anyone else see Anthony dab at 2:10
This is sooooo gooooooooooood !!!
Mal vejo a hora de ver John Frusciante reinventando seus solos pra essa música em shows ao vivo!
O bom e velho red hot
besttttttttttttttttt
Ah, it's nice to go back in time. Home
This song is exactly what the world needs right now
Losing their edge.
I love Will Farrell and the Zits
Am I the only one who hates the way he annunciates some of the words, like it would be a million times better if Anthony just didn’t do that
what a creaaaamy guitarsound :D
The lack of slap bass is disrespectful
John comeback????
I remember the first time I heard RHCP. I was sitting in the back seat of my uncles car and Otherside came on. Then I heard californication and I was hooked. You guys were the soundtrack to my life and I am forever grateful. Not sure if you’ll ever read this, but it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you guys reunited and all is well in the musical world with your existence. Your #1 fan - Manny Sajuan
can't wait to see you all live.
ジョンお帰りなさい！
They claim they will never retire.  And that's just fine with me!
Red Hot Cool!
Kao i uvek, savršeno. Nema dalje. Wie immer Perfekt!!! As allways perfect!
My favorite band
❤️
Maravilhosos como sempre!
Respect!
Johns Melodic Crying guitar
Damn, Will Ferrell is killing it.
スローチーター歌いそうになった
Мороз по коже ! Охуи..я вещь !!! 👍
Frusciante is back ☺☺
This is everything you'd expect it to be, classic sound.
I love this song ! ❤❤❤  I love R Hot 🎶🎵🎵🎶👏👏👏
FIIIIIREEEE!
It is suitable for the soundtrack of dr. Strange new tang🤙
I like what I hear! You guys are the 👑 thankyou for still bringing us fresh tunes!!
Love that fuzz face tone.
RHCP without John Frusciante no soul and feel on rhythm. See this man back with that SOULL....
worth the wait
An awesome "guitar backing track" of this song on my channel!
Wasn't the moon create in a Hollywood studio?
please add some tour to indonesia
Wow!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
beautiful song
I love it 😘💕  🌶

เฮียกลับมาแล้ว
JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
คนไทยมาทางนี้
Anyone else hear the FF7 Cosmo Canyon theme tune in this?
How did he get Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrell to play with RHCP?
Old but Gold...I Love RHCP ❤️❤️❤️
Lo mejor que le pudo pasar a los red hot,la vuelta de Jhon Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!
RHCP freakin legends !!
Love love love
You are as beautiful as the day I lost you
💗 💗💗　Big Love from Japan.
red hot chili peppers the one and only
John, you’re back. So happy.
doggie
Agreed Willie Smith, not quite the quality I'd like to see, or hear, but I would buy it several XXXXZ!  THEY'RE like wine, getting better with every taste Another fave...😍🤟🎶📀💯  GREAT SH_T GUYS!!
POWRÓT Frusciante do zespołu to nic dobrego
classic RHCP! \m/
When did this happen? Why am I only seeing this in my home page after fkn 12 days? What did I miss? 💀
I used to think Anthony’s mustache was a joke… I’m not so sure anymore…
Stay together guys for ever🔥🔥🔥💕❤️ How I missed John🥺 Adore you all😻
Salam dari Indonesia
Why Anthony Kiedis looks like Tiger King?
My god, rhcp are so fucking boring nowdays. So beige. And fuck me! Auto tune muuuuch!!!! Im out!!!
great song!
It's been a long time since I made a new BAND
red dead redemption 2 song
Oh thank all the gods above for John Frusciante!!! 🤟🤟🤟🤟
Let’s just say that this is a welcomed return
This is filler.. could be track 7 on any of their previous albums with John apart from Mothers Milk and BSSM.  The Getaway was good, a fresh sound. Hopefully John brings sone of his solo career influence into the album. Hopefully not more of THIS, it’s been done to death!
Different years same voice.
Great to see John back!
Frusciante is the man RHCP needs
💯 🔥 Great Job Guys! I hope this song makes the billboard top 100!
The chorus parts of the video remind me of Around the World a little bit
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK
Chad and Flea keeping that pocket tight as always
Vamos aproveitar ao máximo....Red Hot, é simplesmente Red Hot e .
John Frusciante is Jimi Hendrix in disguise. This is just gorgeous
Como los quiero a estos tipos
Californication ile olan doğan sevgim ve bağım hala devam ediyor. Şimdi sıra kızlarımda. Mükemmelsiniz.
I'm from indonesia i like this song
Glad to know that Will Ferrell is still their drummer.
Welcome back John..
WTF! Fruciante is back! CLASSIC RHCP
i missed john more than my dad
Hard for me to pretend that this is good...and I really want to pretend that this is good.
Welcome back, john! ❤
it's nice to see punisher, will Ferrell, Rooney and John wick making some bangers
Wow this is bad
Yassss 🙌 the boys are back, John is back, the old sound is back and I LOVE it 😍😍
1:51 the moment we've waited for a long time. Wouldn't mind seeing Josh and John just like they used to tour. Their styles compliment each other
So happy that John's back! 😁
I felt like I was tripping on John's solo... this makes me cry
Can’t wait to see them live, can’t wait
CLASSIC RED HOTS. THANKS FOR SHARING! <3 HZA WUZ HERE
I’m very excited for their album to come out. I’ve been needing a new album from someone lol. Also excited for band of horses in March
Simplemente maravillosa
Meu coração foi a mil
Fuuuuck this is good. This sounds just like when i was a kid. Kudos gentilmen that was dope.
Welcome back John... ✊
Love from India 🤘🏼
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺👏👏👏👏👏 feliz
That melody REMEMBER me when old day
Obrigada 😃😃
Miss Josh :( but this is great!
Melhor formação 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😱
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
This is classic chillis so great to see them still making bangers
John ❤❤❤
Wow, Daniel Day-Lewis is sounding and looking a lot like Anthony Kiedis of late....
🎵♥️
can't get enough of this song
They got the same energy as they had 15years ago.❤️ They are just on the other level.🌸 #RHCP🔥
RHCP!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Good to see will still on drums
amigo volvió frusciante
Is he singing w an Irish accent?
DIOS. FLEA CON UN PONCHO.
Flea RHCP bassist Favorit Widi VOB
just started listening to rhcp like less than a month ago but learned a lot about them and i admire how much they’ve struggled and been through and even through all that they’ve managed to stay together and create amazing music
I’ve missed them, glad they’re back
This song sounds like something you would hear in a commercial from the 90s
Who else has been waiting on the Black Summer of ‘09 to end? If you have, then I’m sure this song doesn’t bother you like it seems to bother most people in these comments. Be thankful their still here to deliver for us. 🖤
FRUSCIANTE CAGAME LA VIDA!!!
I thought this was Joe Exotic, I am glad it’s the RHCP. Bout time they made a come back
Why aren't these videos in 4k? How good would these colors look on a 4k display?!?
Clean it up Johnny.
This band I never liked but I give them mad respect for sticking together
Im just excited for the new album cover art.
banda foooooodaaaaa... eu te amo RHCP 😍
It´s sems this was made on the dome where The Mandalorian was Filmed? coz the illumination over them is great, the light perfectly fits from behind to their bodies
os maiores
He sounds Irish. Idk what it is but he makes this sound Irish and I love it
This is glorious!
Can't wait to see them live this September, it'll be my first RHCP concert
Thank You God for letting me live during Their Rise and Fall and Rise again.
Gives me “Slow Cheetah” vibes. Can anyone else hear that  ?!
We have all been waiting for so long and what a beautiful song thanks red hot chili peppers you never disappoint.
😍😍😍👌
JOHN FRUSCIANTE 💓
This is the same band that wrote recorded and filmed the music video for the song "warped" it's crazy what these guys were like in their prime and then how they look today. The song is like a 7.5 for me. Reflects an older more mature perspective still the same vibe but wise and reflective. I doubt they could bang around stage like they used to.
Red hot chiliperpes hero's 2022
Incredible 😍🤘
welcome home John
This is a commentary on the destruction of California due to wild fires in the summer. The manipulation of weather systems created from Geoenginerring should be high on the priority of governments to mend, but they continue to turn a blind eye.  Love the distortion/fuzz out of John's guitar.
john is back
Sabia que não iam decepcionar. O último álbum lançado foi muito pancada, gostei demais! Red Hot Chili Peppers para sempre!! 🎉🎯🥳
The fans are proud of you guys. This song is amazing. Watch Anthony, Flea, Chad and Frusciante together it's pure felling and happiness. Thank you guys ❤️
First time I've seen Anthony look his age
https://youtu.be/jB_CHxFbFa0
17 years. Amazing.
First pearl jam's dance of the clairvoyants and now this. Who is awake will get my message. Stay strong, we'll need strenght.
Man, Will Farrell is an AWESOME drummer!😉
JOHN FRUSCIANTE REVISITED, RELOADED, REARVIEW AND COMEBACK
Amazing 🤩
Wow!! These guys can still kick ass! I'm so glad to see them healthy and strong. Love the song and video. Welcome back John!
This moment... 0:47
🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ ***I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG*** . ... I'M SO HAPPY FOR A NEW SONG FROM **RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS** 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Sem palavras pra desvrever isso, que maravilho
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Que sentimento bom ver John de volta, desde meus 14 anos que essa banda faz parte de minha vida, como é bom ouvir vocês ❤️
Not their best, nor their worst. Good music, lyrics kinda suck.
35 years that I am a RHCP's fan and I am so happy John is back home making great music with his brothers
Another great pop hit for chili’s to last in my playlists.  Can wait for the album.  Guitar work… too nice to see the work
Glad to see frusciante back again! Eres chingon en la guitarra 🎸
RHCP forever!!!
There's a pretty subtle continuity error in the video. Everytime it cuts between regular and close-up shots of John his stratocaster goes from being on the neck pickup to being on the bridge pickup.
Reminds me of the MOFO PARTY PLAN , LOVE IT!!! ROCK ON PEPPERS.
😍😍😍
So nice to know there's REAL fuckin music left in the world.    You wouldn't know it by all the shit that isn't really music in the 'charts'.    Long live RHCP and REAL music.
one of the most boring pieces of music they have ever made...
no me gusta, me encanta!
Yes !!!!!! Que c'est bon putain !!! Pendant que Muse pourrit lentement d'autres continus de nous émouvoir !!
Contrived bullshyt this should not have been the lead single which they continually failed to select the lead single. Also nobody was going to be mad if they just played their old s*** I'd be down to hear remix of the old s*** or just jams and freestyle with Anthony freestyling over the top but this garbage with John's doing one bar of every lick from all of their most popular songs I feel insulted.
SE ESSA MUSICA FRAQUINHA  É A MELHOR DO ALBUM IMAGINA AS OUTRAS KKKKKK
My good lady got us tickets for Glasgow as my Birthday/Christmas, so full of anticipation! Saw you legends supported by NERD many years ago at Murrayfield Edinburgh, it was, excuse my language, fucking fantastic!
Can't wait to be July the 9th in Paris 😁😁😁😁😁😁
esa viola de frusciante es todo lo que esta bien en esta vida ... terrible
It's growing on me. Stuck in my head. I'll up it to a 8. (And Anthony Kiedis  is looking a lot like @joerobinetbushcraft )
Musica para mis oidos.
John Frusciante is like a time machine. He comes in, and everything suddenly returns back to when they used to be.
Is that Frusciante?
he looks more like Adolf Hitler everyday, - get it on~
El tiempo no pasa por ellos, su esencia, sus voces, su ritmo, su todo! Los amo desde mi niñez. 🥰🥰🥰
My Friends (live):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=AdJA0CW9tjc
Amazing. Simply amazing.
Ouvindo pela milésima vez 😂😂😂
que musica meus amigos, que musica. Como sempre a banda Surpreendendo novamente.
Fru, se stai leggendo anche questi commenti ricordati che ti vogliamo bene!
RHCP whats up? come on BRASIL! hugs
Grandpas)
These guys are groving so hard to such a chill beat lmao love it
Como quisiera que vivan más y que esta vida nunca termine para quienes la apresiamos tanto, se que puede sonar egosita que sueno. gracias Red Hot Chili Peppers por este placer lml
wait...is this song about climate change?
At 0:44 when Anthony says, "Here we go", I always think the next line is going to be:  "One, nothing wrong with me.  Two, nothing wrong with me.  Three, nothing wrong with me.     Four, nothing wrong with me."
welcome back 👏🤟🤘
And at the end of the video the sun becomes obscure and light dissapears like would be in a black summer.
Just like the old days
33 grados, mates y RHCP 🥰😋🇦🇷🇦🇷
Not a day goes by where we think that you guys are ever going to get rusty, because you sure as hell didn't in this song. God I missed these songs so much.
Anybody else find themselves always returning for more and more ??
Nossa cara, q falta o jonh fez . Olha a diferença e qualidade no som
I have no words besides “YES YES YES YES!!!”
Ayyy josukee i used za hando to erase time and omg is that red hot chili pepper
Frusciante is back. Rick Rubin is back. The chili's are back. This could have come straight from by the way.
Its been a while but they still dont dissapoint. Great song
If you haven't listened to it  try sir psycho sexy and funky monks
But orbit culture will change your life
They can do no wrong now that John's back and clean they have been one of my favorite bands since one hot minute and by the way keep it up boys
🤍
Best tune since under the bridge!! I SAID IT! Come at me
I like RHCP but Meh ....
Lyrics: 🇧🇷 A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
0:44 - 0:56 let’s doit again
RHCP always has been a band I knew since a very very young age. I remember Watching their videclips with mom. Tbh I was scared by their appearance, Flea had blue hair and as a little kid that scared me hahaha. But I still liked their music! Now I am 18 years old. This song actually made me cry the first time I heard it. I want to thank them for still making music and for being an inspirational source for me (I play guitar).
Frusciante!!!
Caraca maluco, a última vez q eu tinha chorado assistindo algo foi quando o pai do Simba morreu
oh my god
Ya los extrañaba 😢😢😃
RHCP without Frusciante just doesnt sound right he completes them
Era una niña cuando los conocí y me enamoré. Hace mas de 20 años que me acompañan día a día. Los amo tanto tanto!! Gracias por tanta magia y tanta vida! ❤ Los espero en Argentina (ojala vengan)
The songs sounds like a continuation from STADIUM ARCADIUM ✨
Welcome back, John!
Meo tema conchetumare!
Those vocals are haunting that strat is badass too and flea never runs out of bass lines
Same old shit. They just don't rock anymore.  This is so typical and "Safe".
I don't even know were to begin. Seeing them all back together, has shed light on my darkend soul, that's filled with death...loss. It's amazingly beautiful to see, and hear them again. Thank you! Anthony, Michael, Chad, and last , but not least, John. You four are a," Cosmos of Talent!" Your music makes me feel lighter, that has been burdened  upon me with towering weight.  Sleepless nights and the ongoing haze. You've brought peace to my fratured life. I wish I could shake your hands and huge you all. You give us all,"Unlimited Love."
Na iskustvo
This is the way of keepin this band alive!!!!
I think they're from California
This could have been a decent song, but the stupid unnessary autotuning on the vocals makes him sound like a leprechaun.
Waited for this for years and ripped too awesome song
🎸
Gracias mil gracias Red Hot Chili Peppers , regresan los buenos tiempos, la buena música, el buen Rock.
GUES WHOS BACK!
LYRICS:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And china’s on the dark side of the moon Hear me now!

There is a tinge of under the bridge video to it
Die Könige der Melodie. Mega.
Why does he say 'sailor' 'china' 'dark' 'archer' and various other words like a total tool? Good song
Que locura hermano
❤️🌶️🌶️❤️
This song came out just 8 days before my birthday. You made me a gift, I turnt 18 with a big smile upon my face. Thank you Red Hot!
thank you John Frusciante for it
He's always had it. Wb John

Yeaaaaahhhh!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️

Impressionnant Frusciante, le morceau par lui même est banal, c'est du red hot pur jus.
Foda!
My new favorite song, how are they still so amazing. Every song they make just is pure gold

This song is like a breath of fresh air... Bless you guys!!!
With Frusciante, RHCP sounds again like RHCP.
Brutal!!!! Welcome Back Mr. Frusciante...Welcome Back RHCP
Fresh and new....amazing! RHCP Forever!
Chad Smith is alone to be a real Chad
Nice as always, good as old wine, mature as needs to be. I love hearing bass guitar front. They always give me that. Love you guys.
Hells yeah!!! It feels like I've been waiting for this album for a decade!!!
me gusta, pero como el sonido se repite y hay canciones q se parecen mucho... Me gusta mucho q JOHN ESTE DE REGRESO PERO EL OTRO GUITARRISTA ES LETAL IGUAL EL JOSH!!!!!!!!11
Sooner or later, RHCP will play with Justin Bieber or BTS… where’s the time of Get up and jump,  true men don’t kill coyotes, stone cold bush, taste the pain, fight like a brave… :-(
Will Ferrell on the drums!
Bem chatinha!!!
The song is just one good chorus away from being just a f****** epic ripper... the beginning is amazing and the guitar solo is the best I've heard John play in a long time the rest is just blah
Love love love love
Clean Black Summer
Yes, the sensual, enveloping wild west Americana chanson! youtu.be/IamTY7v55h4
Que música perfeita 🇧🇷❤
YEEWWWWWW LETS GOOOO
Siguen sonando tan bien 🖤👌 Ojalá vinieran a mi país :(

THIS is how you mix Bass
No me gusta
Meu crush desde sempre AK
Primeiro lançamento do red hot que acompanho, que venham mais obras primas como essa!!!!!
I didn't like it the first few times I heard but now I can't stop
I love the Red Hot Chilli Peppers ever since my dad showed me their music, and now I’m going to see them at the global world tour! Every night I always listen to them when I’m going to bed. Their voices never never got older always sound the same! 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Love this song. Can't wait for the album!
Omg I'm a teenager again!!!!!  "It's right on time" !!!!
💯 ♥
The song has to grow on me. After the fourth listen, I’m hooked and so excited to see the gang back together!
Ай, молодцы какие! Как в 98-й год вернулся)) Тони порадовал! Да и вся банда на высоте. Респект!👍
Will Ferrell is surprisingly good on drums.
3:53 of everything being okay for a while
Jonh faz muita  diferença  na banda  porra pra mim ele é o cara da banda além de impor sua musicalidade  nas músicas  faz o backing vocais incríveis .
Frusciante is back 😭
I fucking love John Frusciante
That guitar solo. 😦❤😍
Fucking hell, I fell asleep after Californication released and wake up to the RHCP releasing absolute drivel.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
The chillis were always better when they were all smacked out of their heads 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
fuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa q buen sonido xdios saquen mas album q la musica de ahora no sirve
So good to see John!!! <3 My first boyfriend laughed at me for loving RHCP..he was that kind of douchebag who thinks it's the worst band ever. Fuck those peeps, long live RHCP.
When will we hear this live? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
I'm utterly addicted to this song
Good old chilli peppers still giving me goosebumps
Boring, same thing every single album.
OMG John frusciante 👍
Mantep
https://youtu.be/XIs4EakUzJg you can see in this horrible video - young Kazakh guy has been shooted by Russian sniper, he dies during this video 😭😭😭😭
John Frusciante welcome back 🎸 🤟🔥
this might be the best youtube ads for this year.... thanks...
The age of Kazah guys who are been tortured starting of 15 years old, they are innocent kids, without any weapon. Illegal fake president of Kazakhstan, Tokaev ordered to shoot lettally peaceful people without any warning. For month and a half Kazakhstani government tries to hide dead bodies of shooted peaceful sitizens, which number more than two thousand, probably. At thirst decade of January 2022 it was more than 600 dead bodies of killed Kazakhstani people in only one morgue of Almaty city. There are five morgues in Almaty. Also, Russian snipers killed some people in Taraz city and Shymkent city. Police shooted one person in Atyrau city and killed one person in Aktobe city, police killed a few person in Kyzylorda city.
Please remake your music 👍
Please remake otherside
SUPREME! HEY, WE GOTTA MEETUP BREDREN 💚💚☝️☝️🌞
Fantastic guitar, awesome voice, perfect everything!! It feels a little like Hey Brother….
RHCP one of the best! top 3 for me!
Asik nih lagunya 😯
With all due respect to Josh Klinghoffer, with the return of John, it's real peppers again, the kind we love. Awesome song, keep it up, guys. John, happy homecoming!
Drum arrangement shouldnt sounded like that .. Too odd, californiacation stuff
I got goosebumps seeing this. We are back baby!
THEY'RE BACK, BITCHES!!!
https://youtu.be/MYfBzsOuS6k
Forever RHCP
Cada vez que la escucho lloro a 😭
Welcome back John Anthony MF Frusciante ! You've been thoroughly missed.
iggy pop is the vocalist of RHCP....
Criminal government of Kazakhstan tries to terminate democratic movement of our nation. Stop Russian military and political occupation started by Putin in Kazakhstan!!! Tokaev is the terrorist who ordered to shoot to the peaceful citizens to kill them without any warning. During the peacful meetings Tokaev and military services intentionally had hidden policemen and sent bribery marauders. The aim of its action to discredit peaceful meetings in Kazakhstan. Probably more than few thousand of peaceful unarmed people was shooted by Russian snipers in Almaty and Taraz cities; there is no any terrorist in Kazakhstan with the exception of Tokaev, Nazarbaev's family, Putin and special services. Actually, terrorist band in Kazakhstan is Tokaev under the leadership of Putin.

The best part of the video is when the camera started at frusciante’s guitar and slowly moved up to his face, almost like a “drum roll please”
All time favourite band ✌️

So glad to be alive to witness this. Reminds me to the Californication Álbum, John's an mine's favourite album
They back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg they're back to the sound I used to love..this kind of consistency makes them something..this song reminds me of my younger self
RHCP got that vibe which is upbeat, topless crazy yet friendly. Like an old familiar type of friendly.

0:01 FIRST!!!
Damn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que guay, fruchichiante te amo. Suenan como antes, y me dan años de vida gracias
I'm sure it'll sound great live. Not digging the production on this though. Great to see John back
Needs more cowbell

Frusciante Number one
❤ These guys have been the sound track to my life since I was 10 years old.. I'm now well into my 40s! So pleased John's back.
john !!!!!
Wow John's back I've missed this sound
“Dierk side of the meoon.”
Loving this new tune from the Red Hot Cornish Pasties 👌
Californication Drum Beat lol
Oh my guitar hero is back in good shape, better sound, feaking gorgeous fuzz tone Sxxx!!!!!!!!
John Frusciante in orbit
thanks for spoiling my childhood and adulthood. this sucks. stop. please.
Rip the billions of animals burnt in Australia and California.
I was a big fan when they play Punk Funk and Rap , now they are just a Pop band , sad .
Superb
Can't stop to listen this song
Yess..this is THE sound
if i get to meet you anthony the first thing i'm going to do is change your hair and mustache 😘✌🏻
Selalu Yang Terbaik RHCP , 15-02-2022

Anthony, why was your name on Epstein's flight log? :-/
Voice, guitar and everything feels like old but gold times... Feels like we're just back in time! 🎸 🎶 💎
1983 / ∞
Suenan igual pero con un poquito mas de arrugas XD jaajajjaja no pasan de moda GIGANTES !
THIS IS THE CHILI PEPPERS

RHCP forever......verry nice
i bet this will be on cobra kai season 5
Pretty good track. Best I've heard from them in a while! Rock on!
No puedo parar de escuchar esta hermosa canción, me siento tan conectado con su magia.
John is back baby!! 🌶🔥🌶🔥
Eu gostei muito de Black Summer nem sei quantas vezes já escutei, é algo novo e ao mesmo tempo muito nostálgico e ainda tem esse solo sensacional do John, perfeito! Muito ansioso pelas outras 16 músicas!!
Caught me off guard...I heard Jethro tull in Anthonys intro of vacals...classic sound
Siguen siendo los mejores adelante Red Hot, necesitamos mas bandas así ...
Rick Rubin + John Frusciante = real RHCP sound ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍
good thing is not another song about California... with all due respect
0:31 Mas Ari Lesmana, it's that u?
Red Hot...👏💪🇦🇷
Incredible how this music is simillar to Dessecration Smile. They use a lot of the old to put together this music. Both really nice and awesome in the same vibe.
AMOOOOOO
❤️❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩❤️❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩
Eu amo muito vocês
thankyou for staying true to rhcp’s sound unlike all these rock bands trying new paths that let us down. for example like foo-fighters n’ greenday whose new music just sucks imo lol
Hasta ahora solo 15 millones de vistas, y la gente comprando boletos de Bad Bunny
song jisko bhot achi lagi muhja subscribe karde 👌
Will Ferrell kicked ass on drums on this track!
Aaaahhhhh lama ga denger sound gitar ini... 👏👏👏
Ritmos y riffs q solo oíste en Californication o By the way Confirmen!
Excelente, como siempre 👏 🙌
Been to their concerts throughout the years, been listening to them since I was about 14, I am now 48.....
Спасибо вам Перчики, за лучшее детство, каждый день прослушивания ваших альбомов давай надежду на музыку! Спасибо от всего RU Community.
Volvioooooo,Y retumba todo a su vez..
Finally! John is back and the sound is perfect again.. Love this!!!
I love it because they’re getting older but they’re still as awesome as the were when their first album dropped
I LOVE this song - They ARE BACK! The lyrics are always cool, this song has it all...goose bumps and mucho Aroha :-)
Anthony learned this choreography with z-maguinho do Piauí ! Great music and video, RHCP top band !!!!
That solo is inspired
The come back of the dragon <3
I'm feeling the childhood when I used to listen to red hot thirty years ago...
Fucking perfection
esperei minha adolescencia toda por esse momento
Junk
parece uma musica do stadium arcadium
Seeing John with RHCP again… and all feels right again. And with that, I’m back “in”.
RHCP ❤️🎸🔥
Omg its John frusciante; everything's back to norm. Hoorah🙋, no more ww3🙆, viral wipeout😫,no more biblical apocalypse🙌**** went through hell, survived all our comments and picking these strings like he never left....🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇
YES!!! This single bumps... I still have my original "Californication" CD from 1999 when I was just six years old. RHCP are my favorite band of all-time no question. How am I just now finding out that this album is coming out in April??? Can't wait to see them live in Nashville with friends in August. #RHCPFOREVER🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
Became a serious fan 6 years ago........This is my first time (25) hearing a song new from the peppers! This song has every single vibe that every other song of theirs have!
Johns back. ;)
Akhirnya
🎸🌋
A que epocas me retrotrae, gracias Red Hot !!
FCUKING TERRIBLE!! What IS this 💩? Same middle of the road boring formulaic drivel they’ve been releasing for decades...and what’s up with the random Irish accent. Awful.
Awesome!
mcfly et carlito !!! les vrai save ce que je veut dire
Algo bonito algo realmente bonito GRACIAS
Q orgulho dessa banda que já me trouxe tantas alegrias red hot 4ever
INFINITAS GRACIAS RED HOT CH!, VOLVERLOS A ESCUCHAR ES LO MEJOR QUE LE PUDO HABER PASADO A ESTE MUNDO DE CAOS, NOS HAN SALVADO!!!, A DESEMPOLVAR LAS GUITARRAS QUE JOHN ESTA DE VUELTA!!🙌🙏🤘👏
!!!!
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
interesting! appetit is sffucientlylacking tjerefore. let the fat hols look afterb themselbesnFFS
What is with the Irish accent ….Anthony ,  John sounds amazing ..!
If you told me this song was on Californication or By the Way I would've believed you. They've stayed so true to their sound and it's timeless.
Legendary!!! They haven’t missed a beat and been here the whole time! Long live the RCHP!
Why does he look like The Tiger King lol
RHCP forever!!!
Tão véio mas tão pimpão
Jhon de volta???? 😲😍👏🏽👏🏽
these four were born to play together ♥️🌶️🔥
TA RIUIM A MUSICA
Yeeeeeeaaaah 🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪
Oh...no...nononono.......... I guess everyone has to retire at some point. Now it's up to their loved ones to help them retire with dignity.
Honestly without John Frusciante this song would be of no great interest. I hope the rest of the album will be worth the wait.
Welcome back John. RHCP forever.
Beavis and Butt Head : FLEA !! FLEA !!
Nice tune but it would be good to see a RHCP music video where Anthony Kiedis wasn't the focus of the whole video.
Am I the only one to be disappointed by his first 2 songs? No renewal, poor musical (bass, drums, guitar), we are very far from the musical richness of One Hot Minute. Frusciante plays the guitar like in the 70s, unbearable. In short... disappointed
Swear Chad and John haven't aged a day in 25 years
Diego Verdaguer...Rip.
Velký dík za zhlédnutí 👍
Demais, Amei muito🤩🤘🏽🖤. Eu Amo Red Hot Chili Peppers 🤩
Holy FUCK this is the RHCP I know
même énergie même soufle 🤠🤠💪💪💪🤘🤘🤘
cadê o povo do brasil?
grandes red hot que recuerdos del colegio nunca defraudan saludos de chile
So great to have Mr. Frusciante back
They're giving the same vibes as they always do, this is such a great song boys
Solo carregou o hit
First thing I see.  was Anthony Keidis  in a karate outfit and a mullet
Nunca decepcionam

sold his soul to never sell out rhcp will forever be elite
Thank you.
GOSTEI🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is what the world needs right now, Frusciante RHCP comeback to heal our wounded hearts!!
Anthony still has the prohibited steps :')
Will Ferrell on drums :)
La musica necesita volver a sonar asiiiii!!!!
Wow❤️❤️🌻🏳️‍🌈
Во бля деды развлекаются
Flat flat flat
Anthony looks like an out of work porn star. Awesome
We're very fortunate to live in a timeline that includes the Red Hot Chili Peppers
John: "It's my first song back with the band, really gotta bring my A game so everyone knows I'm taking this seriously!"  Anthony: "Think I'll do a pirate voice on this one."
Первый раз услышала их в 11 лет, и с тех пор это любовь на всю жизнь❤️❤️❤️ обожаю! Спасибо вам! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
VIVAN LOS RHCP ❣️
John is back !!! I,m so happy ! Original RHCP !!!
It didn't take long for this song to grow on me. It's not their best, but it sure ain't bad. Chili Peppers have earned their place among the all-time greats.
Finally,someone return from 90x and 2000x rock idols.THANK YOU GUYS
Just realized I've missed frusciante so much but gotten so tired of keidis
2:47 HE DID THE ZYZZ! 😮
Sensacional! Saudades ! E ótimo retorno, ao tb sensacional guitarrista!
Los amo Red Hot Chili Peppers por ustedes le hecho ganas a la escuela<3

Will Farrel sure can play the drums
chily peppers with a little bit more spice of country and hendrix <3
noice
YouTube needs a love button !
O verdadeiro red hot está de volta
I don't like it very much. It sounds uninspired.
What a grower! It just gets better and better with every listen
Amazing 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is a new song that brings memories  lol ...
Omg yes..finally and more than I expected. Thanks for staying real and keeping it awesome 💖
52 and still Rock'n to the Chili Peppers!!!  See you in Denver!!!
Chuck Norris can sing pretty good
RHCP would be great except for the bloody 'singer'. I mean honestly...
Ну такое, как играть разучились. В общем, не Калифорникейшн.
seasons will change,  people will age,  the economy will fluctuate,  but rhcp will never change ❤️
Sounds so nostalgic I’m crying it’s like straight out of the californication album
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
não consigo parar de ouvir! tenho que ouvir essa música ao menos duas vezes no dia.
imagine this song live

John absolutely knocking it out of the park, as always!
Not sure how I feel about this yet. I've been a rhcp fan my whole life. I'll have to hear more of the album

These guys have been cancelled by the cancel culture
John wick
The song sounds like "Easily."
So underrated
Como siempre arte para los oídos‼🙌🏼
I have never found Anthony Kiedis hotter
john's rif is the shit WAW
Smooth, so smooth!!!!
It's like "Scar Tissue" and "Give It Away" had a baby together...  Btw, 0:37-0:42 Mulan reference. Nice callback 👍🏿
John is definitely back, classic chillis. Shave the moustache off though anthony
John back in RHCP...?
Cool... Will Ferrell playing the drums!
Awesome!!
RHCP acompañándome toda una vida. Y con Frusciante de vuelta...más no se les puede pedir, siempre me hacen vibrar alto
Was skating to these guys over 30 years ago.  Been a long time since I rode,  but when I hear the chili peppers,  I'm 8yo again trying to ollie in my driveway.
https://youtu.be/rqdzQOcieIQ Checkt ab✌🏽
I dunno if john wick can play guitar as deadly as his pencil
Lovin this new peppers tune! 👏🏻
Joni!
I love you Jhon!!!!!!!!!!!!
The day this came out as an ad on YouTube. I was dancing in my living room streaming tears of joy.
Heard this while driving my Porsche across town this afternoon. Thought I was some hot shit
Still got it
So happy John is back, just a different feel with him in the band.
They are backkkkk ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is amazing. I'm only 20 years old and I love red hot chili peppers. I hope this gets more young people into their music.
Easily top 5 best rhcp songs of all time.
Nice and miss that things you guys...
kick kiedis out and just let frusciante sing everything thanks!
Frusciante < RHCP
한국에서도 RHCP의 신곡을 손꼽아 기다리는 팬도 있다는걸 알려주고 싶어서 한글로 댓글 적습니다. 이렇게 긴 시간 트렌드에 뒤처지지 않으면서 자신들만의 분위기를 곡에 멋지게 녹여내는 밴드가 얼마나 있을까 조심스럽게 생각해봅니다. 돌아와줘서 감사합니다.   Thanks for my hero, RHCP.  We're so glad to see you again. From Korea 🇰🇷
Very weak song, hope rest of the album is better
Welcome back John, we sure missed you!
Instant shivers down my spine - Can't wait for April!
The best songs they put out in 15 years
Yarrix gibi olmuş. sonlarda Dark Necessities'i seviyoruz
بشاريبشار
The real Red Hot Chili Peppers are back! 🤘🏼
Drum rhythm at the intro is the same of Californication, magic!
Is it just me or is Anthony Kiedis turning into Eddie Guerrero, the wrestler??
Good song
🤘🏻🤘🏻
Vengan a Argentina please 🤩🤗😎😍😍😍
Jeez Anthony K is turning 60. I guess he and Lebron have the same physicians. Love the song by the way.
you know your band is untouchable when john wick is playing the guitar for you
Oh no mr Frodo
Que viciante♬♥🔝
Огонь!
I like the song. Still find it annoying that Kiedis continues to copy Iggy's shirtless schtick.
good song :) i like it
LET'S GOOOO!!!!
y'all better stop playing with me
Solo 1:52
I only like it for John's sound. Usually i couldn't give a fuck about RHCP's
Amazing SONG. Love from Greeece !
That's  jamming
Algum BR louco por RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS??
John looks right back at home. I never took to the last 2 albums that much, but listening to this, it sounds like true RHCP once again
Они все такие же👏👏👏💪🤘😎
John F guitar improv is unpredictable yet brings harmony, similar to Flea's bass, Chad Smith's beat and of course the vocal Anthony.. 4 different cardinal poles that attracts each other.. They are once again complete..
Seems a beautiful song.. It could be a good album.. Seems a little bit stadium arcadium
How will Anthony looks in 10 years... with approx. 70!!!??? still great and not like us with huge belly 😂
Woohoo.. 👏👏
This sounds a lot like old Chili peppers, I love it. What a pleseant surprise.
Classic RHCP. ♥️
Can't really listen to them again. Great ensemble and talent, but you can't unhear the fact the lead singer fucked a 14 year old, aware of her age.
Nice to see will Ferrell doing well in other aspects of his career 👍🏼
Good to see them again
Right now few thousand of young innocent Kazakh guys are been tortured by illegal policemen in Kazakhstan jails, I ask all humanity to support our demand to stop illegal sadistic torture and set free young Kazakh guys.
Frusciante eres grande.
I been waiting  I been waiting  For a chili cd 😁
good one..!!!
中年太りが解消されてるｗ
The best song!
Fire... 💥💥
When video with McFly and Carlito?
Love you guys! Forever young, forever friends! Music touch the soul, your shape is insane!!! So inspiring! Keep going! You got the army of funs and is because you are simply the best! Thank you!
You guys are legends forever for me, So I've listened to your songs from childhood 13y  until now 34y, Best forever 🤟🤟🤟
Ciao mitici!!! 😎 ben tornati!!!! 🤟🤩👋
I don't think anyone else in the world can pull of a tash and mullet like Anthony Kiedis!!!😎
MY FAVOURITE BAND ....... SAKANA ENTERTAINMENT from TIMOR LESTE
Didn’t know John Wick was the guitarist for  the RHCP lol
Keren..
Finally a proper guitar solo in the charts again. RHCP are BACK!
For a group, who’s every new release, is almost immediately recognizable, just gets better and better!  Thank the gods that hey’ve always chosen to walk their own path!
This song comes close to the level of "My Friends" their best song ever
They have a bit of Celtic and Norse tones to their music - love it
John Frusciante es todo lo que esta bien en este mundo.
Lockdown haircuts are getting wild
The original lineup still making good music.
Amazing 🌶🔥❤
Discovered the RHCP since OtherSide and it was love from 1st sight Seeing the impact of age on them almost makes me cry We Love You ❤️❤️❤️
More of the same sounding rubbish from the silly peppers 🌶 😜
My hero!
Gives me stone roses vibes
I come back here literally every day
🥰 Love RHCP 😍
2:50 I like this song but not this transformation. too jumpy to the ears... it should have been more gradual.
From Bali (indonesia) listening🔥🔥
Siéntate relajate disfruta y piensa en lo mejor que está por venir❤️🔥
legend
No comment
OH MY GOD!  My heart is beating so fast!!!  You’re the best!
Happy days the song 🎵 is deadly.. Can't wait to see the. Live.. in dublin again ..
grandi frusciante sei grande!!
Anyone in the same band as Anthony Kiedis is wasting their talent...
A smile of Flea.. priceless 👌
Amazing ❤
Jojo reference??
Love it, "Waiting on another black summer to end"
Just like from ashes to the new era/arena of music
Will Ferrell can still hit the skins like no other 🔥
Manteniéndolo simple a estas instancias,  unos amigos  dándole a un buen jameo sacando buena música.
This is pretty low-effort considering Josh Klinghoffer's absolutely genius work with RHCP (Feasting on the flowers, Detroit, Police Station, Did I let you know, Happiness Loves Company, Even You Brutus, Ticonderoga, Encore etc).  Basically everything from their previous two albums wipes its ass with and pisses all over this generic filler tune.  And I'm a Frusciante fan.
Y ese Sarape!!?

Why is Will Ferrell on the drums?
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry, Cremation takes its piece of your supply. The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon, And China's on the dark side of the moon. (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo, A personality I never knew. (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton, the archer's on the run, And no one stands alone behind the sun.  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end, It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end.  Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship, Riding on a headless horse to make the trip.  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end, It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end.  I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Waitin' on another black summer to end. I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Waitin' on another black summer to end. I've been waitin', I've been waitin', Waitin' on another black summer to end.
Btw I don't know why but I've found the hidden path to the dark side of the moon. Okay restocks rabbits dig holes. The night if a thousand eyes we will run off the world soon. Then the door will be SHUT remember what the door mouse said FEED your head. Oh and bring your kids and pets. "Spiral over Norway" last train home the loading has begun" Neil young traveling without moving
Don’t lie to your selfs chili fans this song kinda sucks
....dude, get rid of the stash ok.
The song really grows on you.  I've been listening to them for 30 years, so I'm kinda numb to their new releases.  This is an instant classic.  The world needs this groove.
Goats
They made it so now the music seems to flow naturally.. awesome to see new stuff
That little lick at 2:21 ugh so good
I feel like we picked right back up from 2006, could of been a track that almost made it to stadium arcadium but was too jammy and psychedelic for the album, cool song, nice to see John back all in all
Im only 22 but I’ve been listening since Stadium Arcadium and have read both Anthony and Flea’s books ❤️✌️
Daaaaamn, siguen intactos en todos los aspectos después de un largo largo tiempo
Will Ferrell is such a multitalented guy
Esta canción perfectamente pudo haber estado en Californication o By the way
Good Old John is back,the band certainly was missing that writing & mystique of John`s,glad he is back
Thanks, guys
That solo made me cry away 😭
Kiedis used to be the cool guy, now he’s some Irish / Samurai/ pirate with a horrible haircut. it’s also time to lose that dirty moustache. At least he can sing in pitch these days but looks atrocious 🤣😂🤣
I don’t care for this song. It’s boring.  I really enjoyed their last album. It was different and creative.  Will be interesting to hear what the rest of this album is like.  I think they made a mistake bringing John back. He will just quit again. Josh is much more creative in my opinion.
I have waited so long to hear that guitar sound again
love it
We've all had some Black Summers indeed since this Pandemic arrived... I hope it ends soon.
PICA!!
I was hoping that John coming back would allow the RHCP to move forward. Using Dark Necessities as comparison for a lead single to Start a rebirth.  The song is a huge let down.  I am a lifelong fan. I hope the rest of the album is better than this. Dark Necessities with Josh on lead was and is one if the bands shining moments over the past 10 years.
My dad and I just played guitar together for the first time in a while because of this song. Thank you for the inspiration ❤️
Kudos to the art director on this music video. Very impressive blending.
Can't tell you how happy I am to see John.
Pinche rola chafa :,(
Kiedis sounds like pirate Steve from dodgeball
you are the youngest oldest the best musician ever..
Good jobs 👍
I loved it instantly. Been listening to rhcp since early 90s I’m very happy they are still making good music and that I’m still here to enjoy it. This song fits well with the times and all the covid bullshit
When I don't know why is not raining anymore, I come listen this song ;)

Red hot chiliperpes best 2022 master
Are they the originals or is it a parody?
Ya están envejeciendo estás leyendas 😢 Gracias por llenar mi vida de hermosa música ✨❤️ ❤️✨Tkm Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤️✨
Muchas gracias por ese ritmo chiliper
That would be a Tarantino ending credit song.
🤘🇧🇷💙
Temazo carajo, ya quiero oir el nuevo material
What happened to Josh?
So awesome to see they still together. His voice hadn't changed at all even after all these years.
Zoramthanga kawngpui chhawng sawi pawh ka hmu thawi ve deuh e
Nice to seen will Ferrell help out in this song
Grande red hot chili peppers 😎
this pretty good
now thats a fuck good song
Still living the 90s 🫀👊🏻🤘🏻
I❤you!!!!!!
This song is amazing, already gives off some strong Stadium Arcadium vibes, also John looks great, happy to have him back on the board. Can't wait for the album!
Beautiful.
Didn’t know John Wick is RHCP guitarist
Diego Verdaguer aún vive en RHCP
A modern voice that can still relate. Thank you guys

Complete CRAP
Always a Fan of one of the Greatest Band’s. Listening to your music is like shaking you’re hand’s. Only true fans can understand what it takes to continue being the original Man. A Love that’s Deep, a soul that’s Pure! I’m forever a fan as the old man knock’s on my door

Red hot chili peppers Maior banda de todos os tempos❤
Nothing will ever beat the sound of drums, guitar, bass, and a vocalist
Testo senza senso..mha
nice folky paganism ♥️
I like the drumming.
Eu nem chorei, só fiquei tremendo!
Temoooooonnnnnnm!!!!!!!
I don't like what they did to Josh, but I have to admit John's chorus and guitar bring me back to life. Feeling like a teenager again🔥🔥🔥
Que banda foda ✌
Red hot é mito , a maior banda de rock de todos os tempos.
Essa música não sai da minha cabeça cara ,MUITO BOA ❤️‍🔥eu fico igual o Flea tocando baixo imaginário pela casa kkk
Garbage
I love this song!
Vaya corte pelo del kiedis,sin duda el peor de todos los cambios q se hace el tío,respecto a la  música, pesima
Who is this?
It's okay, just sounds like every other RHCP song
59 yo A.Keidis..Cant believe they are that Age.. really i listem rhcp till i was a Little boy..now iam 31..damn how fast is every single hour, day, year.. Best band, best feelings in my whole life with those melodies and vocal..so many memories.. greetings from Poland! Love this guys!
John yes.  RHCP  Meh.  I feel like switching the song even though they are all on my device.  I have most of their catalog because i have 20K songs.  Very few of their tunes keep my interest for the entirety.   There is just way too much great music out there that never gets played... this is better than average pop, but for me  i can take it or leave it, and i mainly leave it.  At least there is no auto tune and there are people actually playing instruments.
Gotta love Flea's poncho
Right back to the 90s.
This must have been the cheapest RHCP video clip to make. Still awesome though
Never die Red hot chili peppers
after californication they play one song round and round...all the same songs.. Come back to mothersmilk one hot minute..
Wow. Kleine zeitreise in meiner Schulzeit.  Nice 👍
Wow my favourite band of all time!! After all this time RHCP still produce such good music! Love it!
Feliz de ver un nuevo video de mis queridos Red Hot Chili Peppers ♥
I love his Irish accent in this 🤣
Que música maravilhosa! Eles são incríveis e são como vinho, o tempo só faz bem pra eles aiaiaiiii.... meu coração gente
It's good to hear RHCP still got musical chops after so many years and so many troubles. This is a Certified Banger.
The memories and you all still got it... stay real in the good fight...
they are old,look older....but still they are back and kickin' <3
Musica top!!!🇧🇷🥰
A lenda frusciante voltou uhuhuh
Cuanto me alegra saber que los chilli peppers sigan con su magia y esencia intacta. En estos tiempos en los que si no hacés lo que manda el mercado no vendés... Los escucho desde aquel 1999 que lanzaron californication y desde entonces acá estoy, deslumbrado con cada tema nuevo que van sacando. Con ésta canción demuestran que los reyes están de vuelta🤘🤘🤘🤘
Te amo, Black summer
Как летит время, старею я, стареют люди которые делают лучшую музыку на планете.
Brings me such joy to see those 4 musicians rocking it out again and churning out another classic! I love the backdrop and the natural lighting from it. This is a rad music video. Give my props to the production team on a well executed music video 🔥🔥💯
🇧🇷
RHCP legends
This song, with the band together again, looks like a new child in the family, after it's born it seems like it's always been there 😍😍
John is a God. Damn, he is really back and rocking this thing like the ol' days. An orgasm to my ears!
The perfect sound..Vocals,BASS,Drums and Gutair... Thank You!!! Fan since the beginning 🤙👊
Como faz pra curtir 2 vezes???
A song that just pulls you in..........
Best thing I've ever heard from them
Feels good
Avast ye wha' a shanty. Me bones are a tremblin' wit' the excitement o' John bein' back 'n course Anthony's new pirate voice be better than ever' arghhhh. John be playin' that guitar like he's makin' love t' a pretty fair maiden' n' oh how I missed 'im all these years...I lamented d' day he left... jus' as I did when that lad from Jane's addiction came along in those leather pants 'n lassie makeup. Thank the cap'n all be well again (spontaneous iggy pop dance, yeah!)
i feel like this song is about global warming and the fires in California
Anthony is in pretty good shape. Hard to believe he's 59.
Beautiful ! has the soundstamp of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuYL-keoGvU   or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfreemrK_c0
Amazing fucking solo
I got my tickets for Philadelphia in September can't believe I'm going to see John with them live
Gostei muito bom,nunca decepciona
Is there a more solid 4 piece rock band? Honestly one of the greatest bass players ever also arguably one of the best guitarist ever in an extremely underrated drummer who I think one day we'll get his acknowledgement as one of the best drummers ever also and an amazing frontman who was able to completely change his style adapt and actually grow as a vocalist
John is back. The world is saved. Unlimited lesson love and the Great Awakening!
Como sempre muito bom ,🤟👽
Can't Believe I've been listening for 20 years already I got hooked up with By the way when it first came out, I was in 5th grade never stopped since that moment!. If only Anthony will shave his mustache we will be again on 02-06 Era lol
:)
My band obsesses over doing great RHCP covers! Hope you’ll check out our black summer cover and sub! https://youtu.be/-gX1tzJRrEs  There isn’t quite anything like RHCP with John!! 🤘🏼
This song is gettin more than a 1M views per day and it totally deserve it
{+
There's a time that you need to focus on something else, like producing some new bands! Weak
Eu com 48 anos e nunca deixei o amor q sinto por essa banda e passei isso para minha única  filha  Camila  q têm 26 anos nasceu ouvindo essa banda  maravilhosa.Amoooooooo.
Que leeendo tema ❤️🔥
Thank you for being you....RHCP.
Bom demais, legendary as always

Red hot chili peppers will rock ever and ever, i love it!!!
It's the best time for be alive
THEY RETURNED!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
we better get a movie of rhcp soon
Im 16 years old and been listening to RHCP for like a month. They are one of the few artists of which songs i can listen to all the time and I dont know why but I feel like I've known them for years. I Was surprised to see them post but happy and excited for the new album. They have been making music for the past 4 decades without losing their authenticity and that says a lot about them. Edit: 4 Decades
Flea is a spirit warrior, Love Love
New approach @REDHOTCHILLIPEPPERS distant adaptive & #boom   Too much Darkside shout when you #L☆ND ☝
Gynas on the derk side of the moon
Anthony’s singing has been terrible since Californiacation . This song is absolute garbage.
I never knew Will Ferrell played drums for them all this time
Это прекрасно,Фрушанте лучший гитарист мира!
This ain't a country song Tony wtf
Wtf foreal sound like a hillbilly singing wtf happened bro
Apart from the new pirate-esque vocals, haven’t we heard this song before? Could easily be from any album since Californication. And that’s not a good thing. These guys are static whereas they used to be cutting edge. Been a fan since Mother’s Milk and this no longer shows a band who is willing or even knows how to move forward with any innovation. Shame- used to love them, now I loathe their tardiness.
So does this mean John will be playing live at SoFi Stadium?????? I'm definitely buying tickets now
Wait is that John??? Is he back?????
Su emblemático pelo, coros y camisas a cuadros
Like bring me back to the old times, long live RHCP
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Cant wait for the album!!!!
Guitar solo is off the charts
:)
Well... RHCP went trough many things, your music was valueable in the past and in present too. But please make a better music for the future. Blood sugar sex magic  adn red hot minute was so good you went far from that sonority. I don't want tot be rude, but your old songs is tinkling in my ears. But this song, sorry i will forget 5 miutes later. Create something LASTING again. Thank you!
que chevere
Joe Exotic?
GENIOS !!!
oh fuck yeah
Feels good to have 90's music style while surrounded by too many noisy music. Not all hope is lost.
Aguante boca
And at the end of the music video the black summer suns really go away..
Охуенно🔥особенно запилы!
Amazing band. Please don’t stop. I will play you until the end of time
Masterpiece
Круто!

Aquí la sepa de red hot chili peppers
Refreshing that for once they’re not singing about California.
Classic chillis, love it! 🤩
John Wick plays guitar?
Awwwww.w……maaaaaan. I could not be more disappointed. It’s 100% derivative from older songs and feels lazy.
Звук ахуенен пацаны !!!
Surprised Keidis still has a career after hopping in bed with a 14 year-old two times...
Omg, I just love Johns guitar
After a long time, I expected a theme like this, musical exquisiteness. The beginning is key. Kiedis style for singing and guitar, waaaa. Greetings from ARG
I love Will Ferrell on drum 😉
Sooo good!
I will be there in Nashville in August you best believe it
Somebody to tell this guy that he looks ridiculous with this mustache.
Estou muito feliz em ver o Red Hot Chili Peppers produzindo musica de qualidade ainda hoje !!!
Greaaaatttttttt!!!!! ;)
John 🥰
muito ruim fraquissima musica
The random muscle flexing though
this is a very high-quality song!Peppers also shot "UNDER THE BRIDGE" in 1992, it was after this masterpiece that I became a fan RHCP

I like everything but Anthony - he's just terrible.
Hello guys 😍
I’m amazed by the hole video those mussels 😎
Its such a nice moment to see John Frusciante again on the band, watching him playing the solo in the mid in the song brings me tears on my eyes! We Love you John we love you RHCP!!! <3
JOHNNNNNN FRUSCIANTEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I seriously can NOT get enough of this song. It is brilliant!  And all the guys look so good!
Chad, Flea, Anthony, and John, the sound is amazing. I love you.
Frusciante does not age a bit

Mr. John mother fn Frusciante has still got it my friends. No offense to Josh (who is a very talented guitar player in his own right) but the chilly willies are back. I saw him with the band on the Stadium Arcadium tour and still one of the most mind blowing guitar players I've heard live, can't wait for this August in Seattle!!
Frusciante, yessss! All is right again.
love these chilies 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️💋💋💋💋
GRACAS POR TRAER EL ROCK en este mundo lleno de reggaeton!!!!
Platypus are few, the secret life of Roo
Temazo...
who else is here just to watch Johns solo again?
por favor dios!! no permitas que esta musica termine nunca!! quiero morir y en la siguiente vida seguir escuchandolos!! me salvaron mil veces RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ♥♥♥

Cadê a letra na descrição!? Falta de tino! Puts
Amazing return RHCHP!!!!😃☀☀☀
😍🎶
Kumis lu jelek banget bang...😅😅😅👌
Que bueno es escuchar este tema y de esta Banda, no soy fan pero me gusta lo que hacen, y además me dan una leve esperanza de que el rock de alguna manera sigue en forma masiva afectando. No tengo problemas con lo que cada quien pueda escuchar, pero la decadencia musical nos puede afectar como personas (hablando del género que más se escucha hoy en día).  Recuerdo cuando era más joven, en cada recital al que iba o participaba, siempre habían una “bandita de adolescentes” haciendo covers de los RHCP. Su música la escuchaban chicas y chicos de los colegios secundarios en la calle de mi ciudad. Hoy ya no es así. Solo resta creer en la espera de qué tal vez algún día vuelvan esos tiempos que ya pasó.
John frusciante touch make different on this band 😍
I can already imagine John doing improvisations with the intro and the solo of this song! 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
Como só fui descobrir essa música hoje??? Boa demais
On a first listening it is pretty...not so well, nothing new and inspirational except maybe a few chords from Johns guitar.
Lo mejor que me pudo haber pasado
I knew I needed this. I had no idea how much u til I saw it. My god they are back!!! 4/1 cannot get here soon enough.
Can't wait to look at them on stage this year, with Frusiante makes a difference, so excited
Лучшие
Sounds like a copy mix of previous songs... What about new experiment? New wave?
Son unos cracks
Señoras y señores niños y adolescentes con ustedes ....el sr jhon fruscianteeeeee
My god, you can really tell that John is back. So excited for the upcoming album!!!
Can we all just have a moment and appreciate how incredibly good the guitar solo is? Send shivers in to my spine. Frusciante is on fire!
Damn is 2022 and Anthony still looks hot!
I like everything except the chorus. I don't know. Just doesn't float my boat. Intro and solo and verse i think are great
la magia de Frusciante se siente..... <3 RHCP en la eternidad!
One of the sexiest band on earth
John is back! deeeeeeeeeeeymmm...
I have been listening to them since I was 10 years old, now I am 33 years old, as always they sound beautiful, I love RHCP with all my heart and soul !!!
I've been waiting for the comeback
RHCP always delivers... Sucking balls as expected. Call it quits,guys.
I❤RHCP
Didnt know Will Ferrell is also good in drums
welcome back john😙
finally!! chili is really spicy!!
It's been a long time since I read such a beautiful thread. Great vibes from music enthusiasts and new fans! Super glad this band and song makes so many people happy!!!
DAMN. I'm absolutely floored that after all these years, John can still summon the spirit of Hendrix with his playing. It's so ingrained in him.  I'm SO thrilled to see the classic band back together!! Come to Australia boys, I'll be there for sure!!
Well played, Youtube Ads. Well played.
This sugar arrow right into my cheesy heart.
Este tema no tiene el punch que esperaba como nuevo single pero suena increible y lo mas importante recuperan para mi su sonido caracteristico desde que se fue john de 10 me muero por escuchar el cd entero
Oh god, you sound cool again! John’s return has definitely done a great change in the music that was being played and the style which is back to the roots
Muito bom ter ver de novo aqui kkk
FISHBONE
Nunca mais deixem o John sair da banda
I only had to hear the first millisecond to know it's good.
перцы И 22 году могут дать жару очень круто .
Me recordó mucho a Under The Bridge :')

RHCP❤

I'm so happy.... This was needed in these times.
A love it. It brings so much nostalgia on my mind it makes me actually cry. It reminds me of the times I used to be happy and the world was still alright. Love it even more with each listening.
Solo❤️
there's still HOPE people...
It would have been interesting if they tinkered with some songs with both and Josh and John sharing lead, and rhythm and lead.  Richards, Young, Walsh and many others prefer having another guitarist to bond with.  I really like that openness to share.  John doesn't seem like he'd want to share.  Maybe it wouldn't work but it would be interesting to see if it did.  I really like Josh as a person, but John is the better fit.  I'd probably have lunch with Josh rather than John.  But I rather have John play.

❤❤❤❤
I love Rchp 🥰
Love song
Let's go!
Έλα ρε παίχτη Frusciante! Παίξε μπαλίτσα παιχταρά μου!
Это прекрасная музыка. Очень рада вновь услышать РХЧП
Hey Anthony is wearing clothe- nevermind he just took off his shirt
SUPERBE  morceau comme d'habitude du vrai Red Hot
Rhcp its back🥲
"BACK IN THE DAY" just hit 2022 all over again. When all the others have faded out RHCP is still showin up.  This new generation has a chance to get a feel for what we experienced in the early 90's, but on another level. 100% keepin it real
Gracias
They aged like fine wine.
ROCK n ROLL !
3 minutes and 54 seconds without the word "California" being mentioned
is John back?
Это шедеврально !!! 10/!0
WONT STOP REPLAYING TILL U GUYS R IN nIJMEGEN "hOLLAND AKA LAND OF THE HIDDEN SHROOMS AKA  THE ORIGINAL GREENLAND!!!!! LETSGOOO000000000000000000000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh God 🙏 great song thank you red hot chili peppers
So fucking good to have Frusciante back! the other lad did a good job but there's something extra special when Frusciante is making music with his three buddies
John is back baby!

4/7/22 Rockwercher
we wait for you in europe, u really need to do a big concert somewhere around romania :D
I love these guys and this is really growing on me reminds me of being a teenager and discovering them for the first time
Great Song!I Love you Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!!
Old school vibe is the best/black summer
boring drums :(
As always, great song! You rock! 🤘🤘🤘
Dowm to KPOP!! Rise AlternativeRock!!
cant wait for the live performance where john destroys the solos
This bring me back to the 2000s, stay hours beside the radio waiting for their Hump de bump, Californication...🥺
I'm a pretty young person, so Red Hot Chili Peppers was never really part of my generation, but over the past year I've become a huge fan of their music. I was surprised to check my spotify and see that they made a new song, and I'm beyond impressed how they've still managed to make good music to this day. That's real talent that I hope a lot of good artists today can keep as they move on.
Johnnnn ı ve u 🇹🇷
Выглядит жалко.
This takes me back to when i was a 14 yr old kid buying my 1st CD. I'm 41 now. Thank you for everything and how you keep putting out great music.
Glad to see Will Ferrell has reprised his role as their drummer again!
Back and still jacked asf
top of the morning to ya!! Why does he have an irish acc ent?
It's like times traveling  !
pushing 60 and still looking DAMN GOOD. welcome back!!!!!
The Chili Peppers remind me again that guys in their 50s like me can still kick ass
Geniales!
Wel fuckin come fuckin back john frusciante
Genial Frusciante y Will Ferrell!
John's guitar is majestic as usual and he hasn't aged!
🤣　Thank you so much from Japan!!!(in kyoto)
RHCP with John Frusciante makes for great music. Good to see you back guys.
Is that KEANU REEVES?
Nice to see that they’ve still got Ferrell on the drums.. 😁
Anthony Kiedis is ageless
Amazing music as always inspires me everyday let’s go gentlemen and gentlewomen
RHCP are Back 🤘🏽🎸🎸 Rock Music will never die
Ya están viejos la buena muy buena banda saludos desde Colombia 🇨🇴
Music for my soul. Loved them since the 4th grade. So happy to hear new music and John being back in the band is just the cherry on top!
Well, that was weird.
That frusciante feeling!!!!  WOWWWWW
This band has saved my life !  I am so greatful for their music and the fact that they have always stayed true to their style. Much much from Eugene Oregon!!!!! RHCP fan until death right here !!!!!!!!
I FUCKING LOVE ANTHONY ♥ PERFECTION ALL OVER!!! GREAT AND AMAZING SONG AS ALWAYSS  !!
Pingaaaa siiiiii amooooo ♥️🔥🔥🔥
Mantaf... Selamat datang kembali john, RHCP paling terbaik 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
I love the RHCP.  But this song is pathetic.  The engineering is low budget, with no artistry.  The sound is congested with a boxy ambiance.  The AutoTune on Kiedis's voice is not a good sound at all.  What fool thought that was a good idea?  This sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom on a Zoom.  The engineer should wear a badge of dishonor and disgrace for this.  2 big thumbs down.
El sonido o beat de la batería me recuerda a californication
Esta chidori y con Jhon en la guitarra
Is no one going to notice the fact that John looks like keanu reeves 🤣
Waw amazing  i love u 😍
that mic stand be teleporting 2:50 to the end
asco
& Anthony & the band finer then ever!! Damm yeah be jealous!
On first listen, I thought this song was OK. But it's really been growing on me the more I listen to it. Kinda gives me Stadium Arcadium vibes. Can't wait for the new album!
Solid as usual, the new US!
No wait what! Chili's Just Stood up! Thank you!!!!
I fucking love you!!! Always! The art, my life, my everything... Signed Pisces! Fucking 🔥 HoT
such a good song!
i love you guys so much
Cool. Digging this new Irish/Scottish accent
well its a good thing the dislike counter is off, 14.4 million views and only 555K likes, yikes! it could have something to do with the song being terrible and the video being a generic played out work of trash. then there is the underlining issue of Anthony kiedis going with the i'm for sure on a sex offender registry in multiple states look. i gotta go listen to some 90's songs to get this disgusting taste out my mouth.
Oh Yeah!!!!
They got older but they’re still young RHCP forever  Amazing band!
I'm currently going through the darkest period in my life. Someone took everything away from me. Absolutely everything. And I am trying to kick a years long opiate addiction at the same time. I am walking my way through the heaviest part of the withdrawal process.   Today has been the hardest day so far. The chilis have always been there for me with their music. It always seems to find a way to connect with what I am going through. I decided to listen to this song and it gave me a sense of calm and relief. The second half of John's solo, where he really starts to wail on the guitar, gave me goosebumps and made me cry. John couldn't have come back at a better time. I truly feel like this album may help to save my life. Thank you for always being there for me with your music.
Música fraca. Tomara que o álbum seja acima disso
lyrics about what??
Que som meus amigos! 😍👏🏽
El peor look de toda si historia. Vamos Anthony jajajaja!!!!
I love this so much
E ele está de volta, Frusciante 💓
Happier than ever :)
Just....WOW!
Oh my God! They are back alright!
Su música logra producir componentes naturales únicos en mi cabeza. #serotonina #oxitocina #endorfina #dopamina
los amo♥️
This song seems to say "John is back" Only he can play jhon's guitar.
<3 be like ^^
14 million views and no thumbs down 😊 So happy they sounded like them. It's like there's been no break in music.
First listen, I thought it was ok and a little weird in melody. Second listen being just now with the video, I am so hooked on this song. The boys are back ladies and gentlemen. We have another masterpiece on the horizon.
Great song. I hear a little Eastern Canadian accent at the start of the song. Maybe he’s been listening to some Stomping Tom
Outstanding
RETURN 💥💫🌟⭐🔥
Esses caras são sensacionais, pqp.
is my favorite melody to my ears, is my drug
is a best good  song, this banda never hurt me, nunca me defraudan, este ritmo es de lo mejor los amo chicos es el mejor sonido del mundo
Thanks thanks to bring art to our ears 👂 in this crazy weird times 😘
ive heard this everyday since its released it great song
Oh god this was like a hit after a long time without.
OMG!! NEW MUSIC AND SUPER MAGIC!!!
I ❤ Red Hot Chilli Peppers, they always made a melodious song
:D RHCP BACK !
RHCP is back
RHCP! So glad they are back!
I'm glad to see Will Ferrell still on the drums.
My favorite rock band of all time.#Bless
need that poncho tho
God is coming back soon pls all repent
dudes looking like burning man advertisement
Is there anything Keanu Reeves can’t do?
I’ve been playing this song on my way to work since they released it. And I’m not disappointed one bit!✨
This song will NEVER get old.
second coming of jesus
When did Anthony Kedis become Eddie Guerrero?
Wow
Keanu Reeves??
parce que chimba
For this whole ass time since 2018 I thought it was flea who died what is even wrong with my mind
Hey, say what you want bruh but The Chili Peppers are RAD AF
RHCP for life❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best band I've seen live. Absolutely electric. James Brown was supporting them as well. What a gig.
Sensacional, adoro esses caras!
John is the reincarnation of Hendrix. It's good to see the boy back.
WOW WOW My god they are back with a bang. My youth all over again.
I love this 😀 ❤️ They've been consistently great thru the years.
There are few things in life that touch my soul like frusciante does when he plays. Thank you for this Froooosh 🔥❤️ Thank you for coming home
you are greatest! thanks Frusciante for came back) Russia loves u)
Wow! This sucks!
This! 🔥🔥🔥
Never leave again
FINALMENTE SONO TORNATI.... CON FRUSCIANTE QUASI IL TEMPO SI È FERMATO!!! COME NON AMARLI!!!
Frusciante 🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow!!!!! I loved it!!! Really! It's a song I'll listen to in every barbecue or social moment here at my home.
Wow...just wow! Think I'm gonna cry, classic Peppers sound is back. Absolutely beautiful.
Show jon frusciante fodarastico
In response to some of the comments here, their sound is the same because they stayed together for the most part. For example, Third Eye Blind’s lead singer fired many band members because of pure greed. In fact, when he signed the agreement to sign the band to the record label… he signed all the shares of the bands money to him alone. Total assbag.   Anyway, Red Hot Chili Peppers is the best 90s band
God
Amazing! Welcome back :D
That moustache 😂, that’s gotta be fake I hope 🤞
Guitar solo sounds exactly like many guitar rifs from 1969 & 1970, other than that the song sucks.
Selalu menyenangkan mendengarkan musik para idola di masa remaja dulu, 25 tahun. Mereka masih keren meski sudah kakek kakek.
My soul needed this
Slow cheetah is a prophecy
Que alegría dios! Volver a verlos a los 4 juntos!!
RHCP just like the old times
John is back!
Frusciante should just move back to Berlin and make his own mental stuff again, this is beneath him
saturnian death cult, sold out. preaching the parasites foreshadowance.  yeah, i made that word up. the sky won't cry with a chemtrail sky above him, it's wild to see how manufactured the music industry is. adios RHCP.
I​ Love​ This❤️❤️❤️❤️
Showwwww…… 🤩💕
Amazing ❤️
Yes I like it, more more, more ohhhhh. Ty
PROVIDENCE 💚💚☝️☝️
This track is basically all about covid
Can we take a minute to note that Anthony Kiedis is 59 here! He looks unbelievable for his age.
It's like under the bridge, scar tissue, and californication become one
Pra quem é brasileiro aqui....Fala a verdade, né que a dançinha nos @0:23 lembrou a dançinha do Deus fez tudo direitinho -  Z-maguinho
Siento que regreso la época de los 90s gracias chicos por seguir trayendo verdadera música en estos tiempos que escasea. ❤️❤️❤️ Bienvenido de nuevo john 😍
Frusciante....YEAH!!!
Good shit!!!  Man this brand really is nothing without Frusciante,  try as they might it just never sounds right without him.
uff frusciante  , esos riff depre
My favorite band ever
Johns backing harmonies I've missed most ,,   cant wait to hear the album
Sie haben ihren Sound wiedergefunden 😍
Wow… great after soo long
predictive programming.
Diego Verdaguer no murió, si no que reencarnó en Anthony y ahora se dedica al rock 🤑😎
flamante
Brasil ✔❤
This guys still making DOPE SONGS! Impressed!
Got their hooks in me like they always do. Love the Peppers and I think they sound great here. Welcome back John!
I just miss this kind of music!!
Реды были лучшие, реды остались лучшими!!!!
Music tells live stories if you listen closely
Prophetic.   🕯🌟☮️
Like falling in love again for the first time, like coming home...I wish I could see the like - dislike ratio...
I am sure that this will become a RHCP classic. This song has the typical Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe and sound, I love it. Can't wait to buy the vinyl and can't wait to see you live in the Netherlands this summer! <3
I mean it's the Red Hot Chilli Peppers But NOT the Red Hot Chilli Peppers i didn't feel the passion in this song like their older songs
2022 ja tem tudo pra ser o melhor ano  🌶
Just say PERFECT & nice job…🥂
Una semana sin internet y me hallo esto, los quiero mucho RHCP
Greatest funk rock
God...can´t believe i´m listening to a new RHCP song. Thnk´s so much !
John: I am the Best. Public: Fuck you! Yo are the Best!
.......fuckin love this band! Excellent track..!
Sounds like a Cobain solo
Black summer really never ends because  life is equal as to opportunities. Music is always a road
Je suis le seul à trouver que le son ressemble à "slow cheetah" ? Ça reste quand même incroyable  Thank you John Frusciente Thank you Rhcp
Mouai ..  🤭.. ça vole pas haut !!!!! 🤞
Thank you. I needed this.
the best
For the kidz
💥💥💥💥Impact
🤘🔥💓🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
The articulations keidis makes in the verses is a little schticky for me. The chorus bangs tho.
Fuck Yeah..........
Excelente
Them Anthony crazy arms dance moves never gets old 😎😎😂😎
Just when I thought I'd never hear the word "platypus" in a red hot chili pepper song...
Omg, amongst all the nonsense today's music scene produces, this is like magnificent blow of fresh air ripping through the thick air of mad inconclusive creations some youths you'd like to call music... love it!
Good song, but the annunciation of the words in the verses sound weird and kind of ruin it. They sound completely different with John back.
Really nice song
So happy John is back <3
É impressão minha ou ele está falando sobre impacto ambiental, isolamento social e guerra ??????    RHCP sempre com essas letras INSANAS kkkkk
LOS AMO ENFERMOS!!!! AGUANTEN LO REJOOOOOO
It's homework DMZ and America headaches
Эти ребята самые крутые)))
I love you Red hot chili peppers 💚💚💚😍😍😍
Lo que te amo con esa Strato
the derk side of the moon \m/
Melhor banda dos últimos tempos. Brazil loves you!!!
Блін, але це хітяра! Слухаю вже, мабуть, 10-й раз і не набридає!  Треба ж, щоб і коментар українською був під такою піснею, все одно їх ніхто не читає :)
Johns back! Fuck yea!!!!
The vibe is real and amazing!
I want Anthony’s energy and physique at 60
Sounds so 60's and 90's, so good ! Can you hear and feel this magical aura when they play together with their true guitarist? Thank you John you're so welcome, Love 💖🎶🤘
todo viejo jajhasjha
Well this song shows that there is one musician in the band and three non musicians.  It's  gotten really sloppy.  This song would be really good if that drum beat actually went with the song.
Carlito ?
The music is good but the actions are cringe lolllll
Welcome back john!
Love you guys and always will. Thank you for always being there for me!
The Chili Peppers are back! This song is already better than most of the songs in Getaway and I'm With You, I'm hopeful for the future of the band with Frusciante back.
Znowu mam 16 lat i kręcone włosy 😊
Josh is a good guy...but John is a different matter...
Album of the summer for 2022 folks!!!!
Frusciante Ever 🔥❤🎸
can`t believe they got Will Ferrell for the video. amazing
https://youtu.be/vXVurbNlEHo
Frusciante 🤘

👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
John ❤️
John is back?
What is Will Ferrell doing in the video???
Ни фига себе))))
Sounds like any other RHCP song.
Will always and forever be my favorite band of all time 🤘
Vengan a Uruguay 🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
QUÉ TEMAAAAA
la magia siempre intacta
Thank you again for a great song!!!!
wawwwwwin2022
deleted scene from Cobra Kai
This song makes me smile so much. Its great to have them back. 😊
John Frusciante.... <3 Magic, simply.... Magic
I miss the peppers funk. Maby get back on the smack.
Otro éxito de Diego Verdaguer, jaja buena canción.
Nothing more than average this song. Hope the album is better.
Realmente extraordinario ❤️❤️❤️  Faltaron unos cien solos de John y es todo   Thank u guys #RHCP
Only love 💕
Wow RHCP basically interpolated "The Butterfly Collector" by The Jam but without any of the good parts. Sad.
Anthony didn't sing about California. Amazing song, can't wait for more.
Will Ferrell still going strong
I've been waiting.....👍🏽
Impresióname 🌜
This Band will live forever! 🥰
they don't even mention California once how am I supposed to listen to this
locurA
i like this b-side
O RHCP voltou a ser o RHCP. John, você é o maior guitarrista de sua geração e o coração dessa banda. Você é o fodão da guitarra, cara.
Give it up for Will Farrell on drums & Keanu Reeves on guitar 👏
Это лучшее что я слышал за последние несколько лет, наконец то годнота подъехала а не фр фр фр это вертолёт
Why Kiedis trying to fake an Irish accent?
👌🏻
RHCP en su estado puro 🤘🏻
That's a jojo reference
Now frusciante is back we can expect some real bangers. Just isnt the same without him, RHCP seem to stumble without with. I believe its his flare that ignites all the others
Why RHCP is so good, cos their music make people naturally high!
cool
Super!!!!!!!
John: "It's my first song back with the band, really gotta bring my A game so everyone knows I'm taking this seriously!"  Anthony: "Think I'll do a pirate voice on this one."
Anos depois mantendo a mesma essência ❤️❤️
This song reminds me of their early music before they got famous.
The return...
man srsly the more i listen rhcp the more i see how they aging like a good F wine :D
Thank you for bringing me back to better days, and thank you for real music; not digital garbage.
Diego Verdaguer is alive
At the beginning when I saw Anthony with a shirt I got worried for a second, but then the chorus began and everything was alright again :D
I'm glad they're back to classic sounds. John's guitar is unmistakable.
I grew up listening to you guys, thanks to my mom, and it's awesome to see y'all still making good music!!!!
Y'all are awesome!!!!
the millenials rolling stones
el tono de la guitarra de frusciante es crema!!
Beautifull music, i love RHCP, saludos de Perú
Is this related to jethro tull?
Smooth, elegant, uplifting, spiritual and an absolute banger!
Il grandissimo ritorno di John!!!!
I know this song just came out but I fucking love it
Is there any other band with 4 individuals  that are solid as fuck!?!?!? For this many, yes I’ll say it DECADES!
Papryczki są super obojętnie z kim są łagodne i ostre
From 0:44  to 0:56 pure Jimi Hendrix vibe! Great!
We love you, Peppers! You're still HOT and CHILI!
yo, Frusciante kickin' ass again...
Welcome back John!!! ❤❤❤ We've missed you.
In the simple words of our GREAT FLEA.. JOHN MF'N FRUSCIANTE! See you guys in September for the first time since I was 13 years old with my dad featuring STONE TEMPLE PILOTS! Always an amazing show with you guys, I couldn't be prouder my dad introduced me to your music when I was growing up. Give it away, give it away, give it away nooowww
And he is back. You knew it since sec one. That guitar just gave me the chills. Excellent introduction to what is going to be an epic album for sure.
Como siempre es bueno ⚡☻
https://youtube.com/channel/UCcMZwUWAe6vo2qaMiYowwCg
Con Frusciante regresan al sonido original, ansioso por oír todo el album
Haven’t seen em tune down since breaking the girl, John sounds great in E flat tuning
me dejó frio...music for the masses
👌👍
frusciante de nuevo es lo mejor del 2022
California drought- skies refuse to cry California fires- Cremation takes supply Fire through the night- night dressed like noon Australia fires- secret life of roo Greta Thunberg.- my greta weighs a ton. Fire Spreads- archers on the run Fire- crack the flaming whip.  Chinas environmental issues- china on the dark side of the moon Brazilian folklore=Headless mule on fire.
RHCP Forever🤎
Havin JF back is the best thing ever.
The song of our summer
Frusciante at it again. Legendary.
0:45 *eminem*

super chill tune addictive gguitar fx
Amo demais!!❤️
Эмейзинг 🤩
Will ferrell is killing the drums ;)
It's a sailing song coolllll.
Wow he sounds great
I feel bad for these guys. They’ve been told to do the RHCP dance for the past couple of decades. I hope the boost in their bank accounts makes up for the inanity of it all.
This was my go to band in my high school days in the late 2000s. So much nostalgia seeing and hearing John Frusciante back in the band!
The 16 year old inside me is just smiling like a fool.
Fun workout song... 30 years and Chilis still rock it out!
Кайф!!!!
Nice bend john ;)
Flea is my hero, best bassist ever 🤘👊
'Feeling blissed'
God,i love RHCP so much! Love this song more and more with reply. Listened to them as a child with brother and since then don't stop listening them. Love almost all(or all?) tneir songs.
They are a perfect team that will be always connected, if any of them leaves , they won’t fit with any other member, good return Jhon
So relief to see them together, and this is just the start
😍
Love me some flee ❤️
in the 92 I had the cassette...blood sugar sex magic, saw them in Milan in 95...
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wooaoaoaoaoaoaoaoahhhhhh it’s just toooo goooooooddd! The riffs, lyrics, drums, bassss, soooollooo!!! It’s all sooooo goooood! * orgasam *
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS IS THE BEST GUYZ
Wunderbar 🙂
Extremely disappointing
Frusciante it's come back!!! Congreats!!!  I'm loved that song!!!  I hope some day RHCP have to two guitars player: Frusciante and Josh.  I love you guys ❤️🥰
Wow 🔥❤️
Te amamos frusciante 😍❤👏👏👏👏👏
I love this supply...thank you so much for all your creations
*As always you are amazing! Thanks for sharing!*
Long Life Living Legend
Goosebumps. Pure unadulterated goosebumps.
GRACIAS RED.   🖖🏾
Escucharlos una vez más y ver a John 💕 me dan años de felicidad 😍😍😍😍
Can U please sing of the US being the dark side and Asia being the bright side , please? This is what the world needs right now
You guys need to do music ads now?
John is a creative and a guitar genius💓  Flea is energetic and passionate 💓 Chad is amazing and emotional 💓 Anthony is charismatic and great 💓 I STAN THIS BAND🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🔥🔥
Frusciate raping guitar as usuall
Who cares what Anthony sounds like? John is back!!!!!
Flea's doing his thing again.
They should have waited to summer to release it, but I'm glad I have it now
thank you <3
Video clip concept is like john mayer
Entiendo la resistencia a desaparecer, pero creo que están alargando la agonía. Ya apenas queda nada de lo que fueron. Una lástima.
Love this Song. Happy to see RHCP live this summer! Great Band, i have loved their music for over 30 years now!
AQUALUNG
Still the best band. Still, the best rock.
I love RHCP but gotta acknowledge that the melody of the song is a rip off of the slower melody in aqualung.
Sometimes I also have a lot of hobbies! Even in the 21st century, the dream of using an iPhone did not come true. Is there any rich person here who can help me buy an iPhone?
Klasik RHCP
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hát ez kiba jó lett!!
Esses caras são fenomenais! Uma banda que transcendeu gerações sem perder suas raízes e com tamanha popularidade, um vídeo de uma semana com quase 14kk de visualizações! Fora a energia deles!!! Além de ver o Frusciante de volta, que faz tudo valer a pena, sem demérito para o Josh, é claro!
iTunes Top 200でレッチリらしい”音”が色褪せない✨👀 Guns N'Rosesもライブツアーと２曲の新曲で大きく印象を変えたけど、レッチリの場合はアルバムからの先行ということでその意味合い大きいだろう。加えてアルバムのトラックリスト１曲目より歪みが少なく、音数も少なくともレッチリの４人で奏でる無駄のない（オルタナティブ）ロックサウンドとジョンがギターを弾くパフォーマンスに”Wow!!"と感じる音楽ファンも多く、お馴染みの姿が戻ってきてオーディエンスの期待も高いよね→★★★★ 2022年のワールドツアー成功を感じさせる...ф(¬_¬) 最近の話題といえば、レッチリが音楽出版権を１億４０００万ドルで売却したことかな... ただ、原盤権までは売却しなかった点はボブ・ディランと同じだ👀 彼らの音楽人生において”終わりの始まり”を予感させるが、プロモーション戦略上ワールドツアーの「テーマ」がポイントかもネ♪(^ − ^) ロックダウンの真っ只中『RHCP＆Unlimited Love』とワールドツアー2022のテーマを昇華させた最高のステージ(ステージング)をプロモートがコア・ミッション！！
Ta e doido bicho.
Hooray!! New Chili Peppers tune!!!!
yes!!!
John Fuciante = RHCP... Nuff said no matter how many guitar player they changed.
I lost my love for their music after I saw Anthony was on the Epstein island list sorry not sorry.
RHCP is back. Nice, very nice.
Will Ferrel keeping the beat for so many years. Glad he had time to get back with the band wile making movies.
o jonh ta parecendo o keanu reeves hahaha
0:44 just few seconds and you think "he's back"
Frusciante is the best
I just can't wait for this summer to come to the concert
Searching for news about their new album almost every week for two years. Finally  i can look forward to april 1th. This first song is Great!!!
Thank you for your Tiger- Energy & powerfull  emotional Vibes !!
Anthony looks like he used a coupon at Borics
Legendary
Antony look going older now 😁 keep in rock grandpa
give me the californian juice
That’s fantastic! Feel free to reach out.
My life just got better knowing that the old band is back in action. Missed you so much John! The song is amazing!  Just keep spreading the love!
longing is treated already....thank you my idol..greetings from Indonesia
Geniales como siempre,,vigentes los Esperaba.  Gracias por no abandonarnos.
Yeah, this sucks
Will Ferrell is good on the drum kit!
Esta cancion NO me ha volado la cabeza, no debería de ser un single.. No me ha hecho hacer un headbanging y decir: "TEMAZO". Es una pena pq Josh estaba soltandose cada vez mas pero estaba claro que le estaba calentando la silla a Frusciante...
Ok I have thought about this after listening to it because there were a few things that weren't clicking. All off this would make so much more sense if they were dressed as pirates sailing at sea.
Después de años vuelven y por todo lo grande, gracia hace años que no escucho buena música y encima fresca.
Everything about this song is dead. The ideas, the production. And as people say, it is like they are a tribute act to their former selves, that drumbeat, John's simple, rhythmic chords and guitar sound on the verses, the solo and chorus, all very much the same as many of their other songs. A shame.
Thank you to the universe for helping John back to the band!!
Will Ferrel is such a great drummer 👌
They are starting to look old 🥺
Sounds like Weird Al Yankovic and some parts of the song you're welcome
01:51 el gran Jhon
love this band <3 was little kid when i first heard of snow (hey oh) since then its my fav band
😭
muito bom ter o Frusciante de volta!! após tantos anos manteram a mesma essência 🤘🏼🖤
Jhon frusciante hey
there back
Es increíble como después de tantos años siguen unidos como banda, gracias por seguir regalando música que formará parte de nuestros recuerdos más hermosos.
Formasi paling sempurna dari RHCP ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Yes just yes!
Os caras são féras demais tem que respeitar 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I was so pumped to see you guys at Boston calling!!! Now I’m really bummed 🙁
they're still alive, alright!
Welcome back Mr. Frusciante🖤💛🖤💛
Welcome back john!!!!
❤️
この出来だったら期待できそう？！
Nice to see John back in the band too. As far as I'm concerned, the real RHCP is, was and always will be Tony, John, Flea and Chad.
Nem rossz
最高！！
will ferrel is so lit on this 🔥
RHCP is alive! 🙌❤️🔥
❤️
I wish there will be behind the scene video for the making of this MV.
Absolutely brilliant.been a long time coming.proper band to smoke a joint & relax.ye man..
Frusciante guitar so wonderfully beautiful. I am getting very nostalgic listening to this. Great track.
You know straight away frusciante is back
Thank God we're hearing a guitar solo again lol
I can't stop listening! Addictive! ♥️
Another level...this guitar line is just from heaven))
Nice I like it.
Frusciante🔥🔥
John is back🎸
Will Ferrell is still drumming like chad smith perfect
Distinct RHCP sounds🔥
This music makes me feel alive!
is it something more beautiful that watching RHCP play a slow song with the sunset in the back?
Y aquí vuelven mis noches de hogueras en la playa, de bailes locos sin coreografía mas que el instinto de seguir el sonido de ese bajo, esa voz, ese ritmo tan característico, tan auténtico. Gracias!!!
Ammmmmmmmmmei 🇧🇷❤️
Siempre Frusciante!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
💣💥💣💥💣💥
👑🔥👑🔥👑🔥👑
Careful Antwon, don't criticise china. Warner bros won't be happy
La cara de Anthony en el 0.35 es como "ei chicos aquí estamos, cuanto tiempo" son amor! ❤️
Wtf ? You guys don't hear the shitty autotune ?
I had to listen to a few times, then someone kindly put up the song lyrics, then went to reddit, I did pick up on this, the platypus, roo, Black summer re bushfires, politics etc there are some Australian references I’m thinking, also other things, incredible band.
Mantap 👍👍🤘
Look at that, Flea manage to stay in clothes to the end.
Anthony doing his best Eddie Guerrero impression.
DO NOT COMPLY The thing you should actively resist is the digital identity. Together with digital currency linked to your online activity. It starts with the digital covid app as a passport, like in New York for example.  DO NOT COMPLY
✊🙂👍
Ouff, 0:44 hits so hard
Or a video of RCHP playing a dive bar gig, when suddenly a California wildfire sweeps in sending everybody into mass evacuation mode... black smoke pushed by the heat vortex.  Will we be able to stop these black summers?
Bom demais!!! Quebra tudo!!! Daqui de 2022!!!
You listen & You Know Its RHCP 🔥🔥🔥
Frusciante!
LESSGOO
Jhon faz uma música pro surf ...
Why John keeps coming back to this snowballing shit show, I'll never know...
This clip makes me so happy! The boys are back and they're as good as ever!
The missing ingredient has returned ❤️
These guys need to move out of LA.
Fabulous video.
Fkn love it... Cheers legends hope to see you in  🇦🇺Australia🇦🇺 SOON!
God bless the RHCP
This just made my day. My week. My month. My year. Thanks RHCP 🖤
I love you Arthur
i Love You REDHOT CHILI PEPPERS
Sounds so much  like who they are... ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
AH YES! FRUSCIANTE ON GUITAR!!!!
Anthony get rid of those big mustach, please.
My black Sumner was waiting for them to come back
There is no rchp without John. I'm so freaken stoked he's back!!! I needed his guitar for my healing soul.
💯💯💯💯 Love it
i dont understand how people don’t like this track.
Increible la basura de musica que hay en Tendencias. Los Red Hot deberian ocupar el primer puesto.
Antony needs to change style, hair and moustache are fail, he is going to be look like Iggy Pop
It’s weird how it’s not something you would want until they give it to us… then the more you question it the more you want it… Fuck.. geniuses
ยังคงสุดยอดครับ เด็ก90S🤘
Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤️❤️❤️
Frusciante is back :')
Absolutely in love with this song! ❤️
Nice song.. welcome home john.
The best of the best, john is back
Love you guys ❤️
Ok this is 🔥🔥🔥
“China’s on the dark siyyyde of the moon” - wow, fucking incredible. I love this song.
This song is so good, glad to have Frusciante back in the band 💚
Who is the new member??
Anthony is the Keanu of the music world. They just stay golden for decades. Both a gift to the world 🥰
I was disappointed that it didn't feel too new.
Awesome vampires..
The oldest teenagers 🤙
flea con el poncho ajjajaja
Cabron esta chida❤️😭👍🏻

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jajaja rukos
Still fire after decades. Amazing sound.
Much love, stay blessed! This is the shit that we needed thank you.
Anthony being 59 years of age and his band band playing still like they did back in the 80s is pure talent love this song.
Still rocking, still crazy and still topless! 🤘
Loco, que hemoso fue, sientes que has escuchado esta cancion antes y es tan espectacular
Volvieron esos acordes de guitarra mágica alegre y melancólica a la vez.. explosiva y ausente.. de manos del genio… 4 letras para definir buena música RHCP…
Thats a good question Bert..... Thats a good question.
Been a fan since the late 80s and still play BSSM regularly..that album is a masterpiece. New stuff sounds decent though.
OH, HOW COOL!!!
Omg Dutch!!!!
It's so refreshing to Hear some REAL music in 2022
Speachless, simplemente sin palabras. Me encantan! Blessings!
The unmistakable vocals & lyrics from Anthony, the amazing guitar riff & solo from John, the heavy bass lines from Flea, and the trademark snare drum/ride cymbal combo from Chad... This is perfect Red Hot Chili Peppers sound. So, so good!!!
I like how after all these years Anthony still sticks to his signature look without any shirt on.  Brings back so much memories
This is so awesome and so Red Hot! Love it!
Rock is dead...and you know
I don’t get it
"Waiting on another black summer to end."  I interpret this as being about the summer 2020 riots.
Anthonys dance moves are so 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why did you keep waiting so long for such a brilliant piece. You missed so much
Frusciante is back 🔥 😍
Frusciante came back, and everything sounds the same, but even better. Can't believe these guys are still going strong and authentic. RHCP never disappoints. Truly one of the greatest bands in history.
RHCP never diee.... Btw why his face now look like eddie guerro?? ,🤣🤣🤣
프태식이 돌아왔구나 ㅋ
best song i ever heard.
!00% original cool video
But is nobody going to talk about that Irish accent? Lol
Today's youth is different from my era in the 2000s, where RHCP Singing back then until now remains good.
how are their song always good !? 😭
son los mejores
They're back
This is wonderful, I needed it🎸♥️
Que buena rola 🎧🎵🎶🎵
Regresaron :') 🖤
Goddddddddd
Wow Johns a  Genius
Not my favorite lyrically but musically with John back they're just amazing!
I want to find out when he left the band and when River died.  Thats what I want to figure out.  Cause the story has always been that he left cause the band was too comercial.
Fuck yeah🤘🤘🤘
🤘
RHCP .........
welcome  back jhon
John's is back!!! Dream  come true for me...
Entusiasmado con la vuelta de los RHCP y esperando que el nuevo album tenga temas más picantes que éste Black summer
JohnFrusciante has the best triads period! He mastered Hendricks perfect!
More!
💪
FC Thia❤️⚙️🤘
You had me at John Frusciante. I cannot wait to get high as a bag of skittles and listen to a new Chili Peppers album with John the fuck Frusciante laying down guitar solos like he did here. Your art is a god damn gift to the world don't ever forget that shit.
If you've ever needed any more proof that John Frusciante is the Chilli Peppers..
Time machine really did exist in a form of music.
it feels like im in the 90s to 00s era. Whenever i hear this i feel like i am traveling back in time. Music really is a time machine.
🤘🤘🤘
Fraquinha toda vida. Os caras já fizeram muito melhor.
🌶️❤️
together again THEE BEST RCHP BAND ...FRUSCIANTE SOUND IS EPIC!!
It would be cool if Anthony grew his hair long again like the old days!
Los  Red hot la concha de su madre!!!!
Will Ferrell always kills it on those drums!
altísimo solo
The sound these 4 guys make, remarkable!
Now I’m super convinced that there’s only 2 version of RHCP, with John Frusciante and without John Frusciante.   Hot damn, the difference is like night and day!
Gak pernah bosen melihat penampilan mereka
This song is fucking rad! This kinda stuff is exactly what we need right now with the way things are.
Favourite band of all time
♥️
Indeed. And how grand they are still.
En serio, cada que veo en este video que es John el que está haciendo el solo de guitarra, me dan muchas ganas de llorar. Soy muy afortunada por volverlo a ver haciendo lo que más ama: Tocar con Flea
Exelente!!! Aún tienen la esencia de la banda q los hace querer aún más...❤️
Wow....
My impression is that this track is sorta weak, but in an intentional vulnerable kinda way, where when the album comes out this song will have its place and hold the power of The record in check. But this is nothing compared to what i think is yet to come. With john back, this good of production, this song feels kinda meh to me as a single.  But i feel like that opinion will change when i hear it in the context of the record. Feels like the calm before a final storm or something.   Am i alone on that feeling?
the guitar solo confirms it is him
Hail the black sun hail jupiter!! 666
Excelent
Que porcaria , será que nunca mais farão aqueles singles que colam igual chiclete em nossas mentes? Isso daí tá fraquinho demais
Finally 😍
So many good licks. I love everything about this and i love you
And I love how Flea tried to paint Anthony in white, regardless the Black Summer.
That flex
Welcome back John!
https://youtu.be/Br_0ze6YsOk
Welcome back John Frusciante!
Anthony is still in wild good shape for 59. holy
Que hermosa música
RHCP <3
Californication Part 2 !!
Everyone of their albums was great and still is to this day. Love RHCP!!!! Great tune once again 👏
I LOVE these guys.  This is sad.  A Beevis and Butthead episode waiting to happen.
*john what are you doing*
Crazy amazing!! John!!!!!!!!!!
Los mejores
John's born to play in Chilli Peppers.. it's amazing, magical, incredible!!! This final solo is the pure essence of Chilli Peppers... I love you John!! Thank you for comeback to you house!!
John is back! Woooooo!!!!
Esse é o verdadeiro chili peppers!! Frusciante é a alma do negócio! Foda pra caralho!!
Boring. Their last good album was One Hot Minute.
Awesome
Nice poncho bro. Where did you buy?. Flea market maybe?. Mexico or Colombia? 😁
Love this song ❤ most amazing band
Younger and younger
this is it wath  people need
Legends
i may get hate for this. while i love john's playing and am so glad he is back... this still sounds a little like the older mellower radio-fied chili peppers of late. still way better than anything i could come up with.
The second that Frusciante's riff comes in..ahh the feels
生猛 用他们的犄角击穿太阳

God is coming back soon pls all repent
2/10
Well evryone,  welcome back to the 90's!!!! Love it, amazing they all look the same,GOD BLESS RHCP!!!
Will Ferrell gets better and better as a drummer with every new song
Thank you so much🥴🥴
Great for a pop song Very great for a RHCP song   But very bad for a rock song
Half of the views are mine. Amazing!
Just like that.. John is back, the sound is back, Anthony looks like he's gotten in shape and has a body like he did 30 years ago.
welcome back John. This is where you belong.
TRUE PURE LEGENDARY!!! THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS STAYING"TRUE TO MUSIC"!! IAM SO TIRED OF THIS NEW FAKE GENERATION OF BAND'S AND MUSIC!! THIS BAND ALWAYS STAYED LOYAL & TRUE TO THERE FANS AROUND THE WORLD!!!💪👊🤘😎
I've missed them so much. I've missed Frusciante solos SO much. Rock on, Chilli Peppers! 🤟🏾
Amo demais 😍😍😍😍😍 Muito obrigada por isso !
No matter how old they are the Red Hot Chili Peppers are simply amazing and I’m huge fan I hope they make music.
Arte uff
UNREAL that is alll!!!!!
So stoked that John is back with the Peppers....Feels like home.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Temooon!
It has everything you’ve ever wish for a RCHP song, and still it has that freshness to it. An absolutely lovely single 👌
No Will Ferrell comments yet...oh wait...nice song boys!
¿ Jethro tull ?
Me recordó a Nirvana Sin perder la esencia de Red Hot
A : Which music genre do you prefer to listen?  B : red hot chili peppers. A : I mean...not an artist but genre. B : That's what I'm talking about.
Pretty good, but a little overproduced and digital-sounding. And why is Anthony singing in a strange accent on some phrases?
WTF? A new Chili Peppers song and video was released and I wasn't aware of it until now? Well, fuck me!
Me gustaba más con Josh en la guitarra. Está aburridon y predecible.
Thanks RHCP. I needed this new song to remind me of past good times listening to your music. I'm 62 and my kids (now in their 30's) introduced me to you guys about 15 years ago. Keep it up.
John, a master of tone and sustain.
I like the music, but Anthony’s voice seems weird here. It’s does sound like Chilli Peppers’ signature sound though.
thanks for coming back guys.
Ellos son una gran banda. Si bien han tenido discos no tan comerciales han mantenido su esencia. Pero definitivamente hay una era nueva desde que Frusciante entró al grupo. Desde Mothers Milk le ponía su sello. En el Blood sugar sacaron canciones que hasta hoy sigo escuchando y con Californication se consagraron. Igual cualquier disco con Jhon se que será un discaso.
Anthony's dance moves never get old
Sorry guys really disappointed with this one antonyms voice sounds so fake sorry love you guys..
Get crunk! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GIS9JzaPJOQ #ministertimothypresents
Anthony is looking like Jacob from Trailer Park Boys these days. Great to hear Frusciante again! I can't look at Flea without thinking " where is the money, Lebowski"
john is the man
shit music
🎶❤️Magic❤️🎶
Sad to witness a spectacular funk/rock band turn into a...common band.
thank youuuuuuuuu  thank youuuuuu thank youuuuuuu Totally organic Rock in 2022. THank youuuuuuuu Red Hot.  There´s hope for humanity still ;) ;) ;)
Música foda, os cara são lendas!
Ohhh I see, in this album the guitar really sounds... what a coincidence. You guys should be embarrased for what you did to Josh.
Tenacious D is that you?
Unbelievable, how perfect!!!! The boys are back!!
Will Ferrell on the drums everyone
China's on the dark side of the moon...and fauci
One week. 13 million + views. I probably contributed a good percentage. Love.
No me canso de escuchar ésta canción 😃! 🇲🇽. I can hear it over and over agin!
0:51 Keanu Reeves, is that you?
I listen to a lot of hip hop but I can not lie.. rock n roll needs to come back
Amazing new track! I can't wait to see them in the Summer. I'm so glad John is back! 🎸🌶
Red hot está de volta 2022 👏🏽👏🏽
John, U are simply the best! 🎸
They still haven't lost it. Their talent and fanbase that is. 11 million in just a week. We're still with you
Am I the only one that thinks that Anthony looks like Gunther now?  Oooh you touch my tra la la 😂
Yes...if That Kick Drum was any tighter...I'd make a "Your Momma" Joke. But out of respect to site guidelines. Thank you RHCP🙏💯❤
In 1987 I was 12 years old and on vacation in Florida  My best friend had just started skating so we went to a skate park and saw them playing a small concert at the park after their concert we met the members because they would just walk around in the park I guess they really weren’t popular yet  I had know idea who they were until years later
I know......nobody can stop that we are getting older every day....but this music is still fresh, young and awesome. Well done guys....still love you ❤️🧑‍🎤
Когда Раст Коул решил уйти в шоубизнес
I've got a feeling this is going to be a great album I've got it preordered
Every time I hear it , it reminds me of Aerosmith's Janie's Got a Gun. 🎤"What'd her daddy doooo..???. It's Janie's last IOU.   To a tee
This is the real RHCP. It has a Little bit Of BSSM, a Little bit Of Californication, a Little bit Of BTW and finally, Stadium Arcadium. The beard did it again putting together the four elements of Funk Rock.
gotta love when he takes off his shirt and continues too fight ninjas and magicians at the same time like always
John is back...wow!
Been waiting for this
John frusiante damn it 😇😇😇
rock on!!
🤟🏼 guys! Great song/video! I’ll be seeing you guys in Orlando, 2022!
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums!
The intro and the 0:44 riffs are awesome.  They have the Hendrix / Frusciante style that I could listen forever on repeat.
Bravo...bravo...bravo.
Cant express how glad I am that they are still the RHCP. Look at nearly every other band with the same timeline and all their 're-launches' ..... all shifting to what they think is popular i.e overproduced rubbish club/rave/ techno crap. Inspiring to see an artist(s) actually stick to their guns for once.
Is rock n roll coming back?
Los red nunca pierden su toque, un temita como en los viejos tiempos. 🤟
I can't die before I watch them live, long live to the RHCP
Esto llega como un bálsamo, de tanta basura que tenemos que escuchar hoy día. Thanks God, thans guys.
My favorite band. So great to see Fruciante back. Gave me chills. Somehow, they look as weathered as the Stones. I love this band. Great song by true legends. Love the Led Zeppelin vibe to the solo.
I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't care if you don't like it, or what you think...
Being unique and popupal at the same time over the years is legendary. Today's music has no soul, just money IMHO.  Just a simple guy from Russia=)
the chorus is the weakest part of the song but i still give it a solid 8.5 overall.   CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE ALBUM TO COME OUT!
Eddie Guerrero
Perfeitooooooo
Que delícia de música, que clipe incrível, ter o John de volta para a melhor banda da minha adolescência é tudo o que eu precisava ouvir para começar o ano!
🔥RHCP🔥
Fucking Amazing Tune .
I feel sorry for Josh 😥
I was requesting songs from them on college radio in the late 80s. And getting them played too! When they post on here now, about how bad this is, I say... Especially in Michigan
Sounds like something straight taken out of Stadium Arcadium and I love it!
Jhon's return was marked by a song that has the soul of RHCP, see and hear this after so long is exciting. And this guitar shows that he came back with everything.
Not bad for elderly men, keep cranking out serviceable pop songs in the nursing home👍
Will Ferrell killed the drums 😌
Welcome back John!
john !!!!
John ma boi youre back!  ♥
Remember Danzigs Dirty Black summer?
Lyrics:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Yeh, keep it REAL🤟🤟.
Always great seeing Will Ferrell on the drums
Been a fan for 25 years. Their chemistry is other-worldly and divine. I hope these guys continue making music for as long as is humanly possible!
А чё, норм, Энтони и Ко выглядят супер! Рад за них!
I couldn't get enough of this band last year and was their top 0.01 percent of their listeners on Spotify. Now I'm over the MOON that I'm getting more!
THIS IS AMAZING! 🇺🇸
Kids, we are safe... Jesus is back
No dejo de escuchar esta canción, realmente desde que salio el primer corto me gusto lo que estaban haciendo los RHCP, nunca defraudan... espero muy pronto anuncien una gira por Latinoamérica.
why he say sailor like that tho
RHCP are one of those rare unique mega superstar bands that still feels like 4 friends jamming in a garage together.. Very rare for a great band together almost 40 years, who have evolved so much, but they never alienate their fans, because they refuse to release anything below standard.
So happy john is back. Anthony looking amazing for his age. Chili peppers are back
Esto realmente es una joya, estoy muy feliz después de mucho tiempo escuchar algo nuevo de RHCP, esperamos con ansias el nuevo álbum
John is back!!! Great
Ооо таааак😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️ Як я скучила за цими звуками і голосом😍😍😍 Дякую❤️❤️❤️ Знову відчула себе десь 17-18річною, коли вперше почула цей тембр😅 То любов😍😘❤️
Welcome back, you beautiful John's tone
Im so happy these guys are still here dropping hits. Real happy for for john f that hes been able to pull thru his demons and keep putting music out in the world. Dudes an absolute g. All of em. Thanks

Didn't know Josh got fired. Glad to see John back. Had to do a double take when I saw him in the music video. Wishing Josh all the best.
Amazing music !! 😍
Red Hotsi dalej mają klasę, szacunek.
no comment is that a good or bad thing?
John I have waited for this return for years. thank you!!! Love you!
The real RHCP stopped in Stadium Arcadium and came back just now. It's so good to listen to this same strato + fuzz + marshall all over again
Joy, another midtempo cookie cutter parody of themselves
K hace ahi el wil ferrel?
🌶😍💥👍
Que foda ver o John Frusciante de volta ❤
Siempre sere fan de Los Red Hot Chili Peppers. Son los mejores. Y es bonito ver que despues de tanto años canten igual😊👍😁
Sounds like same post californiacation shit
if this were some new, unknown band that released this... they would still be unknown (I miss the o.g. RHCP)
Go Truckers go ❤️🇨🇦❤️
salió dos días después de mi cumple no pude pedir un mejor regalo
Amo essa banda 🇧🇷
Es increíble que después de tantos años, sigan teniendo la misma esencia... gracias!❤
My love for this band has been slowly declining since Californication. I like every album a little bit less than the one before. It sucks. Just my opinion, I know. But they're just never going to be what they were in the 90s.
It’s me I’m here 😻🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🤩👌🏻😎😇
autotune is really poorly done on this one. not a bad song tho, just nothing too special.
This is RHCP I like
This is pure RHCP 🤤🤘🏼
Love that they still performe shirtless 😅
To jest Jedna z najlepszych rzeczy jaką widziałem ostatnio, macie w Polsce swoich fanów ;)
Эх, помню мелким шёл с сольфеджио, а в ушах играли RHCP. Хорошее ВРЕМЯ было)
✨🤟🏻😎🤙🏻✨
🔥👑😎👑🔥
All time classic!!!!!!!
Essa banda é o meu amor eterno, eu simplesmente amo. Bom vê-los de volta! <3
Sin perder su esencia!!! Vigentes!! los Tipos!!!!!! Gracias!!!!!!! A los 8 años los escuché de algún cassette de mis hermanos.. hoy con 38 años  sigo diciendo.. Que Banda, por Dios!!¡!!
Finally!!!! Welcome back John!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Es como ver a los Dioses regresar al Olimpo
Heard this in my car. What, are these guys still making new songs? HELL YEAH!
Me vacilan las referencias a vídeos anteriores de los Chili Peppers y que John haya regresado, ojalá con todo ese nuevo arsenal de temas y sus hits clásicos puedan regresar a Perú, me muero por verlos tocar en vivo! 🎸🎶🙌🏻🤩
Will Ferrell again with a great jobs on the drums.
new dishes  but the same spice
these guys do not have new projects, they just go on
RHCP muito foda!
Phodástic! Sempre!
Between Anthony's slightly altered enunciation and the soft guitar tone, it almost has an electrified Gordon Lightfoot vibe to it!
Este si es el sonido de los Red Hot ! 🙌
:)
Good to see the whole band phoning it in again after all these years.
Bass guitar 👎👎
I was missing that beat up strat so much!!
I’ll always prefer this type of music then what’s trending
A band no one can hate on. 👍
❤
*THE MASTERS ARE BACK*
*VOLVIERON LOS MAESTROS*
Tuvimos Multiverso de Spiderman y ahora el regreso de Jhon Frusciante 🥺❤️ Es el mejor año
Solo queda decir gracias! Red Hot
Todos dias escuto essa música top
Is Anthony afraid to shave that lip cabbage cause he would look like Iggy Pop???!!
Anthony kiedis is Irish now? But damn he’s been working out
Я так понял, ребята решили сделать альбом в духе блядской Калилфорнии...
No!!! It’s really f..g special!! Guys !!! Let’s go on!! This is best song I  ever forever!!!
Tantos años con la misma esencia de la banda me encanta los rhcp desde siempre ,tengo 30 años  lo escucho desde niño la mejor banda
My favourite band.
The RHCP coming back stronger than ever !
This song gets better and better every time I hear it. New classic in the making!<3
Essa música tem um pouco de under the bridge. Lógico é RHCP.
Classic RHCP right here💯 we’ll be needing more now that you’ve given us a taste
John is back 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Le retour des red hot
I think 1 million of these views are just me... I love this song!
Red Hot Chili Peppers are back and strong
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Inmortales
He must be a Dr. Disrespect fan.
Simply love
beautiful!
Pretty generic RHCP song, almost feels like AI-generated. And yet they decide to put it out first? Really really hope there'll be at least a couple of better songs on the album. Otherwise ;(
So good, literally have tears. Cannot wait for the new album!
The video is amazing
Anthony has got to go.
Я в восторге. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
OMG he´s back. It´s real. C´mon guys come to Brazil to shake our bones, please!
Their like the Rolling Stones but cooler.
Ma quanto è bravo Frusciante?!?
Amazing 😎😎😎😎😎
Im so happy 😊 🥲
Amei, ficou estilo ze maguinho
In my heart, always. ❤️
John's guitar is one of a kind
Almost thought this was gonna be a Danzig cover lol
Jhon Frusciante gracias por volver es pieza fundamental
Bello...ma non ho sentito la parola California :D
Looks like Daniel day Lewis from there will be blood lol
Mixed Up Everything did a great cover of this one! Check them out...they did the song justice and RHCP would be proud.
Is that Justin Trudeau on guitar?
Ufffaaa que buena rola Machín rin arriba los red hot chili peppers
it's so good to see john with the boys again
First video out and they made Frusciante a puppet with his guitar.  Isn't that something he didn't want to be?  Please humor us and stick a cable in the sick Strat.
bu neeeeeee allahim
YESSSSSSSSSS
te amo CHON FRUCHANTE
What a return just wow 👌 👏 love rhcp
Y cuando parece que estamos invadidos por la "música" de reggaeton llegan estas leyendas con álbum nuevo y se abre una luz de esperanza grande los red hot 🤟
Мои любимые перцы снова здесь, аж слезы наворачиваются
John is amazing
Fez parte da minha infância até hoje❤️✨🔥
That's racist. Can't it just be "Summer??" ;) Haha!
Mas adam suseno
Been a fangirl since I was 13.  30 yrs ago. I seriously appreciate y'all. Thank you!
Back again to say, I still can't believe what's happening in the world of entertainment, Tobey Maguire& Michael Keaton will/have suited back up after 20+ years, bands from 90's area coming back with new sick albums, some bands that we never thought would ever again like Guns N' Roses or members like John. Dude I feel like the world has been hit with a universal nostalgia time-wave, and I'm absolutely loving it! Got films coming that should've happened 20 year ago, and this World Cup is just a little bonus on how entertaining 2022 will be...f*ck Covid bring on all this fun!
This lifted my spirit and I really needed that today. Thanks RHCP for being true to your thing ❤️
Qué gusto volver a ver a Frusciante tocando con la banda nuevamente!
still killing it after all these years!!!!
These guys are still relevant!!!
i love it
When did Kiedis join Cobra Kai?
No se ustedes pero se sintió e los rhcp de los 90s JAJAJAJ
d' ya like dagz? on teh derk side of teh mooon never liked anthonys moustache he needs to shave it off and grow his hair out again  fru needs to keep making licks like 2:22 to get my faith back after getting rid of the kid
After 2 crazy years, this is really good to hear! Thank you guys!
Poco massa
Flea really rocking the poncho
Missed John' s guitar so much 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Dream of Californication
Essa música é muito o RHCP de antigamente. Que maravilhaaaaaa 😍😍😭❤❤
This is beautiful. I've been a fan for decades and I love that, though this is brand new, it maintains the sound and essence of the band I've loved for so long.
Mds, como eu sou apaixonada nesse baixo. Sem condições! 💕
Mouldy slug lip returns with an epic!
So, I'm making a poncho out of my blanket right now, thanks Flea! :D
I cannot wait to listen to this record🔥no doubt it’s gonna be amazing
Adoro o uniforme de baterista do Chad
Una muestra de que se puede transcender en el tiempo y seguir siendo geniales. Y los acordes musicales siempre top.
Cannot wait for this album to come out
John é um dos guitarristas mais fodas do PLANETA, muito bom vê-lo de volta, looking forward to see you rocking again in BR ;)
Nothing exceptional...but we re all going to hear it at least ten times a day on the radio, then it will become a hit and so on...
Brano da ascoltare al primo impatto puo' non piacere subito x me pezzo valido mi piace
Californication style
Не могу перестать слышать тут Летова  ……Глупый мотылек догорал на свечке. Жаркий уголек, дымные колечки. Звездочка упала в лужу у крыльца...
like always they kick it hardcore.
Uau, estou de volta a 2002 ... por um instante eu podia jurar que já era 2022 mas pelo jeito era só um sonho conturbado :v
Люблю RHCHP ,  спать не могу :)
Hey John Frusciante 🎉
its smell like old rhcp. god, how i missed that
Love this new song! :)
Amazing guitar work with and amazing rhythm section, it's so refreshing to hear John doing background vocals again.  The lyrics are timely in a uniquely RHCP way.  I can't wait to hear more I have a feeling the remaining tracks will be even more fantastic!
This Video is a masterpiece,i look and hear it repeatly all day!!!
Their essence is their essence. Every band cultivates their own essence. It never changes per se, it's just what the essence of the band is.
so refreshing...this is the best...
The heroes of my childhood are back. Shed a tear, hearing John hitting those angelic notes again. Fuck this is amazing!
Time stopped and only the music moved 🎶💞
Someone could make a great folk version of this song
Reminds me of skynard
Another iconic solo from John Frusciante!
Bentornati
Bravo od MAKEDONIJA !!!
Great sound.
Nice mullet Kiedis.
King Anthony shows such restraint in waiting 1.27 minutes to take off his Shirt. :)
He's back!
When did Bruce from family guy join the band?
Coming back after a few days  Like it much more for reason I think it’s a lot to hear at first
Suenan igual de increíbles que siempre , solo que cada vez suenan mejor!! Nostalgia escuchar esa guitarra
I didn't know Will Ferrell was in RHCP
Endlich ✌️und wieder werd ich abgeholt, wie beim ersten Mal vor langer Zeit.... Yeah🙃
Why does he sound like a drunken Irish Chinese sailor?  I guess that was the point.
Just thanks you red'hot ! ❤
Lord knows we need these vibes back in this day in age !!!!
👏 amazing, Love it!!!!
You hit the dislike button, you'll lose your thumb ... Simple.
🇯🇵🙏🙏🙏😭🙏🙏🙏🇯🇵
RHCP ever and for ever!!! 🤘🤘
Amo essa banda vcs voltaram curto demais saudades de vcs
Wowwww!! And John is back too ☀️
I want to know who Anthony's trainer is. 2 years ago he was really showing his age. Now it looks like he's back in shape to rock again. Not easy to transform that much when you hit your mid-50s! Oh, and SO happy to see and hear Frusciante with them again. The best RHCP lineup, as always.
Super 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
Frusciante deu um up incrível no som
I loved Anthony Kiedis since he tried to beat Goku for the Red Ribbon and killed that man with his tongue
Después de tantos años de basura auditiva llegan y nos dan esta magnífica canción,extrañaba música de ustedes. ❤️
🙏🥰😇😂
This is my song
jooooooooooohnnnnnnnnnnnn
Smells of new album
My first CD I bought was RHCP in 2001 and I still love their music thank you guys for the vibes
Is that Joe Exotic?
🖤
RHCP forever. 🤘
🌍🤘🏽❣️
😍😍😍
Solo a me ricorda slow cheetah?  It’s just me or this song remember slow cheetah?
better then I hope can´t wait for the album and tour
2:11 Dab
Leider nichts besonderes,wahrscheinlich eine Nummer die es bisher nicht auf eine Platte schaffte. Schade
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Fantástica banda y muy vigente!  me han acompañado en todos los momentos de mi vida, es muy especial para mi volver a ver a jhon frusciante otra vez en los RHCP!! Que sean muchos años mas disfrutando de estos grandes musicos!!
John Frusciante :)
Its ok but Too soft for me.
What different accent? I read an article that said Anthony had a different accent on this song but I don'treally hear it!
yesssssssssss
Putain les Red Hot sont revenus pour niquer des mères non mais c'est quoi cette MASTERCLASS SANS DÉCONNER J'AI TROP HÂTE DE LEUR PROCHAIN ALBUM 😍😍
The addiction to this song is real lol It has been so enjoyable revisiting the Chili Peppers' catalogue this week too. Thank you for the continually awesome vibes, RHCP! Much love.
Anti-Communism, Anti-China message heard and recieved.
OMG JOHN! FUCKING LOVE TO SEE IT IVE MISSED YOU JOHN 🥲
Despues de tanto tiempo siguen sonando genial, muy buena la cansion john se luce con su solo magico. saludos desde Venezuela es y siempre sera mi banda preferida
O Frusciante voltooooou
Take me back to those days
It sounds like Californication 2022 Edition?. Cool!
THE GREATEST
Keidis needs to drop that morning health and wellness routine... Dude looks incredible for his age.
El buen John está  back
[Insert Obligatory Joke about how Will Ferrell plays drums for RHCP here]
Eles voltaram ? 👀
😍😍😍😍😍
This song is a definite ear worm, slowly crawling into your brain. I though it was "okay" at first, now I can't stop listening to it and appreciate it more with each replay.
John Frusciante - wellcome back )))
like always - the BEST
John Frusciente is the prodigal son.
Having John back like all these years didnt pass. They always sound great together.
beautiful guitar,<33
Their return is always something I love, but knowing that this time I'll be getting to see them live for the first time makes me happier than ever
Wow what a bless to hear new piece from the legendary
This sounds great!
The Getaway fue un fantástico álbum muy energico y divertido pero Frusciante es la esencia de esta banda.el outro (3:39) esta divino!!! no puedo esperar por el album completo. 💛
I'm in love with Frusciante's tone in this song.
John takes the Peppers to another level.
Why is he singing like an Irish folksinger?
Já deu irmão...
Love john frusciante 💞
Como Não amar essa banda <3    BRASIL
Was hoping they wouldn't continue doing these bland, beige tracks but if this is what the album's going to be like then I'll pass.
I see Will Ferrel finally took over on drums.
John is the reason I play guitar. I’m ecstatic to see him back
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is the most chili peppersy song to ever chili a chili pepper
bestialidad!!!!!!!!
Will Farrell is so good at the drums! :)
no mention of California?
Poro Josh
Anyone else have this on re-peat for the last week now!    <<i'm guilty of this!>> Cheers to a GREAT summer for all full of good music, chill vibes and a RHCP concerts!
You just made my day... I'll be humming this all day long.
Regresó la buena música
this lead singer is 59, its amazing
unrealistic at the end. There is only 1 sun in the universe and they show several suns setting at once. This is not accurate at all!
2022 e os caras não botam a letra na descrição
Just got done watching Flea in baby driver. "That's an Eddie no nose no know page 1."
que vibe fantástica
😍
🤘🤘🤘😍🤩😍
Real chills at 1:52
Это чей то, у Fiea на басу наклейка Ленина из мавзолея?)))
Not for me
RHCP❤️❤️❤️
Is good, team
Crikey, Anthony is looking more like Barry Chuckle as time goes on
i don't like it....so previsible....they are so far away from something new...modern like Give it Away album...where is the hot funk??? Gone...but i'm waiting the entire album to see ! where is the funk, the rap???? Boring.....!!!!!
Wow, até que enfim! Música viajante como era de se esperar, bom demais estou ansionso pelo novo album
Meh.
Amei a novidade 👏
RHCP have transcended, they're not even music anymore, rather a path to a greater being.
You INSTANTLY get the RHCP vibe with the magical sound of Frusciante! Welcome back man! We all missed you!
🙈
AND THERE BACK 👍👍👍👍🎉👏
Tiger kings music has changed since prison
Dedito arriba 👍🏼si ya te aprendiste la letra 🙌
Julian Casablancas looking older these days
Oh My God.... RHCP still alive...👍👍 and John Frusciante is back...💥
And Chinas on the dark side of the moon! 🌙 🌚
Lyrics  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon   Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun   It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end   Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip   Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end   I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
With John's return, they sound like Red Hot Chili Peppers once again
I did not know Will Ferrell was a drummer?
Irretocável <3

Amazing vídeo, amazing music, Rhcp continues to be awesome, since after all.
Tears after hearing them after so long.
Parece un tema clásico pero en la actualidad
Oof
Amo vcs seus filhos da puta
This is TOP !!!
Even if they keep making similar songs, it’s so great to listen this kind of new ‘red hot’ music again. I’ve waited for seeing these 4 old gentlemen so long. It’s so emotional and touching. Expect their new album and let me stay with them for a long time, please.
A lazy rain am I 怠け者の雨は俺だ The skies refuse to cry 空は泣くことを拒んでる。 Cremation takes its piece of your supply 火葬は、君の一部を取る。 The night is dressed like noon 夜は真昼のような格好をしてる。 A sailor spoke too soon 船乗りは早とちりした And China's on the dark side of the moon そして、中国は月の裏側にある。 (Hear me now) (俺の声を聞いてくれ).  Platypus are a few カモノハシは数少ない。 The secret life of Roo ルーの秘密の生活。 A personality I never knew 俺の知らない個性。 (Get it on) (乗せろ). My crater weighs a ton 俺の火口は1トンの重さだ The archer's on the run 射手が逃げ出した And no one stands alone behind the sun そして、誰も太陽の後ろに一人で立ってない。  It's been a long time since I made a new friend 新しい友人を作ってからずいぶん経った Waitin' on another black summer to end 黒い夏が終わるのを待ってた It's been a long time and you never know when 長い間、いつ終わるかわからない。 Waitin' on another black summer to end もう一つの黒い夏が終わるのを待ってる。  Back the flaming whip 炎の鞭を返せ Are sailin' on our censorship 俺たちの検閲で航海してる Riding on a headless horse to make the trip 首なし馬に乗って旅をする。  Been a long time since I made a new friend 新しい友人を作ってからずいぶん経つ。 Waitin' on another black summer to end 黒い夏が終わるのを待ってる It's been a long time and you never know when 長い間、いつ終わるかわからない。 Waitin' on another black summer to end もう一つの黒い夏が終わるのを待ってる。  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' ずっと待ってた、ずっと待ってた。 Waitin' on another black summer to end もう一つの黒い夏が終わるのを待ってる。 I've been waitin', I've been waitin' 待ってた、待ってた。 Waitin' on another black summer to end 黒い夏が終わるのをずっと待ってた I've been waitin', I've been waitin' ずっと待ってるんだ Waitin' on another black summer to end 黒い夏が終わるのをずっと待ってたんだ
Aki-aki prik
And just like that, it's 1999 again. Just for a few minutes. Bittersweet.
Anyone know the meaning of the song? In my head it was written from the perspective of a post apocalyptic world.. platapus are few, black summer and its been a long time since I made a new friend.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I liked of the 1.25x version hehehe
Estos si son los Peppers.. Gracias por volver John!
Can someone tell why Will Farrell is still the RHCP's drummer?
Good music
Спасибо вам за переживание вы лучшие!!!
Лучшие))
I hope they step it up with the next releases.
ジョンおかえり♩ ずっと待ってた新曲嬉しい😃
So glad they are back. John's intro needs it's own song. Beautiful.
Amazing!!!!
We been waiting RHCP
2:36 me realizing Anthony is 59 🙃
Que bom que voltaram, estava na horaaaaaaaaaaaa
音楽も映像もすばらしかったです
Terima kasih untuk musik yang begitu indah
Wow such a groove again!!
Grazie per essere tornati, in un momento come questo ne avevamo tutti bisogno 🔥
THANKS JOHN FRUSCIANTE FOR COMING BACK , WE LOVE YOU!
Они просто были в очень длительном отпуске. Ура!
The Legends Back RHCP... Hail to the Peppers!!!
What in the world is a black summer?  Am I the only one Wondering?  Everybody else seems to know already, or they're not talking about it... Lol
Better than the last few years of material from them
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
O Jhon voltando as musicas saem da melhor forma ...... Aquela segunda voz de respeito !  BRAAAAAAAAAABOS !!!!
Kiedis singing the verses like he's in an Irish trad band for some reason.
fml this is it !🤩
Cookkkk sek sangar wong2 iki....🤘
Porraaa, vocês são foda!!! Sempre perfeitos!
Happiness is stunned by the groove into making us all move.
RHCP AWESOME
I am in fucking love with this!!!! I've been jamming so hard at work, and it helps me forget that I'm actually working!!!!
Anthony's body hasn't aged in 30++ years
👌👌👌👍👍👍 Good. how do i like you!!!
this is SO GOOD, what a time to be alive!
It sounds like a B-side from the Stadium Arcadium era and I’m all for it
greetings from indonesia...awesome...this is the perfect formation of RHCP
Vocals are so lame
Has Kiedis developed an Irish accent?
Man, that's the Red Hot Chili Peppers I remember. GOOD TO SEE Y'ALL BACK ROCKING IT🤯!!!
Welcome back JOHN FRUSCIANTE... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its a awsome song nice kudos
It's like John Frusciante stopped aging when he left RHCP
Obrigada RHCP ♥️
Just found this band today & I love it !
One of the best memories of my life is walking down Carpentaria beach with my friends listening to Behind the Sun.  That was 1989.  RHCP is still my all time favorite band and This Velvet Glove is my all time favorite song.  Thanks for all the great music guys!
I remember listening to these guys as a child back in the early - late 2000s. Its insane how so many people have a childhood with this band, and theyre still putting out bangers
I am always amazed by how many talents will ferrell has.
I've allways met RHCP with this alignment. But let's be honest Josh did a very good work. Now that Frusciante is back we can feel is vibes into the songs.
John is back, so awesome! 😍 And Kiedis’ body is fucking insane at his age. 🤯
Legend is back
△
My heart Seeing them😭
Glad to see john come back,love frome CHINA
I love me som rhcp but I didn't really like this song... the lyrics though, they slap !
Welcome home, Jonh! ❤
Just Amazing! 🤘
Welcome back, John.
Long live beloved RHCP!
Essa música me trouxe uma paz
We Love you Guys !! Peppers never give up, simply the best !!!!
Dios mio los amo que ganas de verlos en vivo YA 🇦🇷
Every time I listen it gets, FUCKING BETTER!!
I'll feel strongly  that that the chillies  we be our generations  rolling  stones. They  keep giving. 💯
I been waiting.... I been waiting... waiting for the Red Hot to start rocking again!
El Diego Verdager banda
Nearly cried when I saw John was back! Can’t wait for the album. John just gives them that RHCP true sound we all love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Finally.
Good to see Frusciante back
John looks like John wick
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
JOHN F'N FRUSCIANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RHCP is as colorful today as it used to be <3
1:54 I LOVE Flea's dance so much
This band never disappoints!
come to GREECE
La mejor banda del mundoooooooo, chulada de canción  Siempre hacen canciones espectaculares pero esta vez se volaron la cabeza 😭😭😭
Eres el mejor guitarrista para mi de la historia, rayos quiero llorar 😭😭😭😭😭 John Frusciante eres el mejooooooooor maldita sea 😭😭😭
Te amoooooo John Frusciante
Will Ferrel looks really good in this.
Frusciante’s back 🖤
I LOVE U GUYS u have no idea how perfect you are and the impact u have on so many people’s lives including mine, still maintaining ur spirit and ur amazing music for almost 40 years now, genuinely love u guys and hope u always shine on!❤️
Definitely not their best, not even close
Ces mecs me donnent le sentiment de rentrer à la maison après un long voyage ... Enfin réunis!!!
Yesssss. It never changes, but never gets old, and always relivent. Love the peppers. Thank if theres a God for music !!
Nothing says California like that gross sleezy 70's porn producer look.
Freestyle de NOAL ! Reality III Disponible ici https://youtu.be/0UkjyZZ_8j0
2.53 that's  me.
i am hapyy!!!!!!!!
12,713,610 views and still counting. Welcome back, Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Love the hendrix sound on the guitar parts
Will Ferrell quit acting and is now drumming for the RHCP!!
I promised to myself if John Frusiciante rejoins the band I will pay whatever money it takes to see them live, because I was so upset I could not see them in the 2000s. Even though I am drummer not guitar player I just love Johns playing so much. He is such a soulful spirited musician. Besides his funky rhythm guitar playing his solos really stand out to me they really give me shivers. It seems all his feelings, torture and pain culminate when he plays solo.  I Hope he is really into it and happy doing this though, because in the the promo videos  he looks kind of indifferent.  Anyways forever grateful that he came back. Thank you John 🙌
It's hard to describe how happy I am to see Johny back and to hear new sounds in good old style! Be well guys!
Love Frusciante!
God I miss this combo.   Still have the magic after all these years 🤘🤘
Eu quero morrer nesse solo, que maravilha do caralho
Idk why but the intro remind me "god was never on your side"
Welcome back chilli peppers! Amazing song!
The boys are back !!    We were all waiting for another black summer to end
hehe Brko u akciji :)
In the scene where guys sing, the microphone stand that Anthony did thrown away but it has changed every time the scenes change, so we can see that they have been shooting many times. 全員で歌うシーンでアンソニーが投げ飛ばしたはずのマイクスタンドが場面が切り替わるたびに転々としていて、何度も撮っているのがわかる
Se dice que los años le sientan a unos mejor que a otros, a Red Hot les sentó genial 👍
0:39 "Lenin lived, Lenin is alive, Lenin will live!" - Lenin😉 Hello from Russia!
12 millions de vues en une semaine ! Bravo les redhot 🔥🎉🎉
Totally getting a nazi vibe of Anthony
After...long...time ..finally🥰💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥😊
That one intentional "off" note in the guitar lead sounds so sexy 😍
Still vibe
welkom bek jooooonnn.....
This song sounds like a jamming session for some reason
I'm so grateful to experience this music.  This band has influenced me from a young man, what a beautiful journey and many more to go.
I Love This RedHot Chilly Pepper Grup Since of 1990 until now after Pear-Jam 😎💪
Iguano ,no me gustó tu corte pero maaaamn que canción tan buena como siempre 🥰
Awesome 👍🇳🇿
Will Ferrell on drums - nice!
Music today sucks.  This doesn't. I wish kids could remember that sometimes you have to learn to play an instrument instead of using drum machines to make beats.
Nossa esse baixo com guitarra deles é incomparável passe o tempo q passar ❤️🎶
Mr Frusciante ! Welcome back 👊🏻
I think the last 10 years was The Mildly Hot Jalapeño Poppers. Now we got The Red Hot Chili Peppers again.
Die hard rap fan but god damn do I love this band only other genre I’ll listen to is everything by them. They’re too smooth
Love it
Looks like they’re on tatooine with all of those suns
Stayed true to the funk.
Red Hot Chili Peppers playing on Tatooine is so damn cool! :-P
Will Ferrell is back on the drums!
John did a great job. the only thing that I don't like is that Auto tune in the vocals that I can hear in a few seconds on the track.
red hot rules. but what a shitty song honestly
SUPER PETE FLEA!!! MY BROTHER-FRIEND IN THE SONG
Mas la escuchas mas te gusta
Wow cool they got John wick on the guitar🤘🏻😂
Looking forward to that new album!!
what it it about chili pepper outros that just suck me in like crazy,, sir psycho sexy and wet sand and this,, just heaven
NICE NIGHT 🌙 WATCHING NOW💻🔮📱
Going chill with the Chillis🌶️😎👌
John Frusciante definitely brings back that vibe I felt was missing for awhile
Saw them in San Antonio back in 2016 or 2017 best concert of my life 🙌🙌
Forever young RHCP!!!👍👏
Que puta música bosta
It’s so good it hurts! 🤘🏼
❤️
never get old
They never disappoint.
1st listen: hmm it's alright nice to have em back, nothing great 3-4th listen: wow the guitar in this song is just SOO GOOOOD 20000th listen: BEEN WAITING ON  ANOTHER BLACK SUMMER TO ENNDDDD
Awesome
Anthony Kiedis is on Epstein's flight logs.
My favorite song of RHCP
Impressive they continue 2 hit it out the park time and time again🇺🇸⭐⚡🔥⭐🛸
Yeahp. its is back!
Thank you so much
📀📀📀📀📀
It is just good  Thank you
I honestly don’t think it’s that great. Certainly isn’t as great as when scar tissue was released as a single
fora do normal como amo vcs
Amoo ❤
Special secrete song Yall....Police Helicoptor...30+ back.  Come on nah.  Now check out Odd band....ANNA BABOULA. .. COS  Greek Fire...in the baths of Constantinople... n go back to....Live Evil...Bitches Brew.  Come on nah
18:39 Trời thu đẹp nhất về đêm. Đời em đẹp nhất là thêm anh vào
Will Ferrell mejora cada vez más tocando la batería, es impresionante.
Red hot 🇦🇷💪
Sounds like this could be on stadium arcadium. Really good
epic
Fan for life. 🙏🏼
Welcome back jhon!!!whe miss you!!!
🥃
The fuckin Magic is back OMG am so happy to see this flow back again !!!!  Frusciante got the best alchemy with 'em imo. I will be at your concert again in PARIS 2k22. Love you !!!
Such a perfect song! Love it’s power, it’s melody! RHCP the best gift California ever gave us. Keep making music, we’re gonna keep listening to you guys til the end of our days.
Anthony: “I’ve been waiting.”   So have we. Waiting patiently for new music from RHCP.
Yessss!!!! 🥰
I just got outta jail, this is definitely my 2022 anthem
awesome they finally got keanu reeves on guitar
remind me 2 song at one time: black hole sun by the soudgarden and main theme from smallville by the Remy Zero - Save Me
@tomas.ugarte_ SUBO COVERS DE LOS CHILIS PICANTES JUNTO A MI AMIGO CHICHIZOLA ARRUABARUENA amen
AMEN AMEN
Love this but why at times is AK giving a leprechaun flow?
They should stop! looks like many other songs they have done before. Nothing new, nothing that makes me vibe or anything else.
I want more songs 🌶️🖤🔥
If in the studio this solo is amazing, imagine live... John, you are unbelievable!
Thx
Let’s get this to 20M views let’s go 🌶
F*ck yeah!
Sorry Josh, but we needed John back so bad!
"QUEREMOS A LOS CHILLI PEPPERS !... ! QUEREMOS A LOS CHILLI PEPPERS !...! QUEREMOS A LOS CHILLI PEPPERS !! "
Jesus Lord, my soul has been waiting for another black summer… their music literally saved my life and now I have a daughter and 3 grandchildren. So unbelievably grateful that I’m still alive to hear their new creations and have an opportunity to see them in person one last time!!!!!!
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES!!!  . I AM BEING SHADOW BANNED BY COMMUNIST YOUTUBE TO SILENCE THE TRUTH TO KEEP THE MASS AT BAY UNTO SUBMISSION OF THERE AGENDA OF ECONOMIC RESET THAT IS COMING FROM ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED COVID 19.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. answer. JESUS CHRIST.
Im gunna tell my kids this is Queen
Would it be possible to keep Josh as a second guitarists?
I will back love ...
Not bad.  Especially Frusciante.
amazing
hillel would be proud 😭
Masterpiece
I love the Chili peppers but if no one knew who they were in 2022 this video would be a joke
I love John' Have we all forgiven him for killing River Pheonix?
wow, just wow
Ya se extrañaba la buena música ♥️♥️♥️
Good to be back John Frusciante 🎸 😀
Te amo frusciante por ti le hecho ganas a la vida XD
Siento que falta feeling... Pero tengo fe que en el disco abra mejores riffs 💪
This song just feels so perfect
play this great theme of the peppers at *speed 1.25* and you will live another experience, in addition to that the energy of Tony and Flea will seem like that of the 90s
♥️
Going to their tour with 2 of my closest friends since early elementary. While we’re some of the younger fans @ 24-26, we’re absolutely PUMPED. The first song i heard by them was around the world and that’ll probably our anthem till the end.
RHCP 90's 🤘 RHCP 2022 still🤘
Does anyone else think Anthony kiedis kind of sounds Irish here?
I've been waiting, waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to end!!!!! This is embarrassing and lackluster to say the least. Forgettable, predictable song trying to replicate the boring radio fodder of "Californication", with a severely cheesy video no less. These guys have obviously lost their edge and forgot about their roots decades ago. They reached their peak in 1991 with "Blood Sugar Sex Magik"  which came out 31 years ago, and have been on a steady dismal, pathetic decline ever since then with their musical output.Please stop already RHCP, you are immensely embarrassing yourselves and what you once stood for. Just listen to these RHCP albums listed below, instead of this latest insipid tripe : The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984) Freaky Styley (1985) The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987) Mother's Milk (1989) Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991)
I just wish the drums had the BSSM tone
Will Ferrell is really good with his drums.
Is that John? Is he really back! HOLY SHIT!!!
meudeus como e bom ver eles juntos
Hola comparto con ustedes la famosa canción mesaytara en español 💃🏻 👉🏻 https://youtu.be/qM0R7EWK_9E
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  #Enjoy #RHCP
Glad to see Will Ferrell is still drumming 😄
Good to see Will Farrell back on the drums 😉.
ISSO ESTÁ MUITO BOM VOU CHORAR
Instant classic.
Esperava mais. Achei fraquinha
Me encantó son los mejores 👌🤘
So good and great to hear that RHCP sound but I could not help but see Jon Bernthal  in Wolf of Wall Street when I look at Anthony....lol Love it.
Thank you for always giving us your art RHCP 💚
And all is right in the world again.
While I think Josh was great and contributed amazing and I absolutely love The Getaway, there's just something about Frusciante man
That breezy energy John brings is back in the mix. The boys are back. I love it.
If you didn't smoke weed listening to the RHCP you had not childhood
I'm retarted
😀😀😀👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥Amazing Band...amazing sound...amazing work... 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Congratulations 🔥🔥🔥#RHCP4ever
Why are they singing about China and Greta. This is comms coming out.
RHCP is ♥️
Lol its nice to see flea still in charecter after all those years.
You are always going to be amazing
chad smith needs to learn a new drum pattern.  shit is stale
🔥🤟🏻😎🤟🏻🔥
😎🔥😎🔥😎
Slow cheetah vibes
Welcome back #RHCP ❤️
Anthony shirtless, Frusciante and the boys  doing their thing...I know this vibe. works every time.
🖤
I’ve been listening to this song nonstop since it came out, so good 👌
Why doesn't his stylist finally give AK the straight dope on his facial hair? Going for a Tom Sellek this time? He is super cute and cool with long hair. On his head.
🤯😍
well RHCP get ready to rumble again .... coz it is time again
РХЧП всегда остаются сами собой и узнать их можно с одной единственной ноты❤️
the CILLI PEPPERS IS BACK BABY!!about time, what was the hold up John F my DUDE
I miss You!!! Welcome back RHCP
!! Frusciante, LOVE watching him play. Thank goodness. This is RIGHT, RHCP.
The legend is back
🙏🦀🛶🌞
Grande, Diego Verdaguer llegando al cielo
wooooow RHCP!!!
Who's listening from Colombia?
Nice song...Good job Chili Peppers
This is the sequel to "Under the Bridge". So magical it was to hear for the first time ..
One of my best band ❤️
Sorry.  Don’t like it.
this will revive the world
it goes hard the red pepers SRTILL GO HARD
These guys right here. Feeling free like Im a teenager again. I love evolving with a band. Gettin older with them, going through life together. But nothings really changed at the heart of it all, not even Anthony's abs.
RHCP has such a large budget that they can afford Will Ferrell to appear in their music video
0:41 john wick?
This SoulFeel is Come Home..
Seems the RHCP used Bowie's cut up technique to make a new song from old chords and words....
If you’re reading this we are RHCP family ❤️
You can tell Frusciante is back lol. Nothing against Klinghoffer, i don't like so much I'm With You except a few songs but The Getaway was really fucking good imo.
Wow just simply marvelous
🙌Red Hot and legendary for almost 40 years!😃 Yes bros! Keep the fire burning  so I/we all can continue to selfishly indulge😝 in great azz music🎧 for as long as we live!!!🌶🌶🌶
Wow , what a return !!
Red Hot Chili Peppers без Джона Фрушанте это все равно, что Korn без Хэда  Да, звучало прикольно, но все же это не то  Я очень рад, что Джон вернулся в группу
Maravilla de tema! Nada ha cambiado en pleno 2022 la musica de RHCP sigue sonando fresca como en los miticos 90 😅
Ok its finally growing on me. It did take me sometime to feel it!
ありがとう😊😭生きてよかった 生きる
Weaksauce
Their newest song, yet already one of their best songs. Glad the boys are back 😎
Never cease to amaze!!!! Can’t get enough of the RHCP’s!!!! Always put out fantastic music!!!! Truly geniuses!!!!😎🤩
Ay 💖 cómo los quiero
Anthony Kiedis is very similar to Balthazar Bratt in this video...
Frusciante mito !!!
Sólido.
Yeah, they still sound great.  I have been hearing their stuff since Under the Bridge
love the band, but the song avarge  at best
❤️
FRUSCIANTE ERES MI FUCKING IDOLO 🤘🤘🤘
Fantastic !!!!
SE LES EXTRAÑABA
Sigue siendo un temazo
The world needs the Chili Peppers
How amazing is John Frusciante🎸❤Love that dude so much
https://youtu.be/EYVX6VVB_Vc
Thanks 🤩💜🌟
Been listen to this everyday since it was released
I'm so glad Frusciante is back from his own journey. The peppers got that old sound back. I love his back up vocals and guitar riffs. Klinghoff was good but not frusciante.
Amazing.
🇧🇷🎸We, the Brazilian fans, warmly thank you.  It was worth the wait
Grande Diego Verdager y will ferrell
I'm convinced, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are this timeline's guardians of the galaxy... Crazy, hodge-podge of musicians who come together to fight for what is good, beating back the darkness with their awesome collective of sound and good vibes. Thank you RHCP!!
0:43-0:46. Priceless
0:46 anthony says: here we go... curtains up john frusciante ladies and gentlemen
Seems like this is about covid, in lock down over summer for years waiting for it to end, can't even go out and make a new friend, mentions dark china
Minha paixão por RHCP ficou abalada qdo o John saiu. Não esperava mais nada e me contentei com as obras já existentes. Agora a chama volta a queimar intensamente. Obrigad John Anthony Motherfucker Frusciante. 🇧🇷🇧🇷
No puedo esperar para escucharlos en vivo ❤️❤️
I’m getting the album on vinyl. Hands down
Glad song John back out there shredding, but even better to see Will Ferell back on the drums
THE BEST SOUND EVEER!
Ever fell in love with a song from the opening bars? And Flea still a beastly legend on that guitar 😍🎸😍🎸😍🎸😍🎸😍💗😍🎸
The sound of frusciante guitar just hit different, since ever.
Behind the Sun reference
My video is stuck on 2.9k ! First time spaming but this shit gives me OCD.
Os caras estão de volta!!!!!!
I'll be waiting i'll be waiting 🎶
John please never leave again ...
Amazing... Its like they never left.. Been listening to them from the early 90s..brilliant to hear a new album coming... 0.45 when it kicks in is effin amazing
Well that was so surprisingly good!
Están diciendo que este tema es como Emit Remmus. Pero ni el tempo, ni la base, ni el patrón de rasgueo, arpegio, ni los acordes (Emit Remmus esta en otra afinación) coinciden. En todo caso podría compararse con Slow Cheetah
E essa bateria entrando no meio da música na mesma levada de Californication? puta que pariu meu pau tá na testa
Finally a guitar solo in 2022
Te extrañaba, John 🤍
My love for this song is unlimited.
Mientras veía el vídeo no pude dejar de pensar que ustedes cuatro son la banda por la cual me interesé en la música a los 11 años. No me sale decirles otra cosa más que gracias; gracias por reencontrarse, gracias por quererse tanto y, sobre todo, gracias por regalarnos nueva música ♥.
Let's be honest I think we all knew, This was gonna be 🔥 And, With All due respect...    Anthony would have a New 'Do'? Haha But it's ok Because that's 🔥too! Boys. Can't wait to hear it Live 22/22 🤘🏼🇬🇧 🧡
Can someone explain the lyric?
Wow!!!   This is really, really, really good!!!  Other bands wearing stupid face masks in video and RHCP killing it like they’re all still in their 20’s back in the early 90’s
When did they get Will Ferrel to fill in for Chad?
Guitar Solo at 1:51 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
this song makes me feel free wanting to go out into the real world and make friends
🙌
É Frusciant caralho!
Grande
This feels authentic, this has soul
Anthony is looking more and more like Frank Zappa all the time. (maybe it's just the moustache)
Eu esperei tanto por esse momento 🤍
I'v been waiting .. yes i did Jhon i'm glad yo back
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Increíble , los veré en Barcelona el 7 de junio !
que obra meu deus
Check out my guitar cover of Black Summer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj0UutHo2PU
Great job, Will Ferrel!
Look, they broke joe exotic out of prison. But for real this is a great song, I will be listening to this for years to come
Anthony looks like don ramon
Good music
Só de ver John Frusciante já vale o Like! 👊🏻😎
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷!!!!!!
A few listens in and still not really feeling this (yet). My main issue is the way AK sings on it- almost like an Avicii track; this style doesn't suit him, imo. Everyone else sounded good and more or less as we'd expect (in a good way), though the track is imo pretty unremarkable- very surprised they chose this to represent their first work together with John in so many years. As a life-long Chili's fan since the 90's, I am super keen for the launch of the new album, and do catch them live in summer '22- always a great time at a Chili's show; coolest audiences. Hoping we get at least a few more albums from this lineup of the Chili's. My all-time fav band.
Sou apxxxxxxxxxx aaaaaaaaaaaaa 😍😍😍😍😍❤️ perfeitos
Best news they made 50 songs and said a second album will very quickly follow the one released in 1st April
Thanks Frusciante
Guitarist saves the band 😉
Holy crap!!! Yall are back!! Y’all didnt sell out to new age either!!!
Welcome Back
John!!!!!!! He’s still got it 🎸🎸🎸 It’s also funny that no matter where the “industry” is musically, you can’t deny talent and the reach it can have organically
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back
Chad Smith is the man.
It's like a second life, so great🤍
Todo Mexico dice: Queremos a los Chilli Peppers!! <3
this is incredible
I LOVE RHCP❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Will Ferrell !
still legend
¡Es orgásmica esta canción! No paro de escucharla, ¡quiero más quiero más! 🌶🔥
My life is always more pleasant when John's back with the boys! Sorry, John, I know it can be hard sometimes..
I love u so much #BRAZILLLLLL #RHCP
沒想到還能有新創作
That's a load of crap
Wwooooowww
I was introduced to the sound of RHCP in early '92 in a nightclub in Orlando. "Give It Away" became the anthem of our holiday, and I've been a fan ever since. 30 years of great music! 🤘🏼😀🤘🏼
Sounds like crap too me
John's guitar tone is the only drug that won't kill you.
Como nadie lo hizo aqui va la letra:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Después de mucho siguen siendo los mejores
Música para meus ouvidos John é foda de mais 🤘 🎸
🎸💜🍾👍🍷
meh
Que rolota y que viva el ROCK en English Y en español y en todos los idiomas viva el genero ROCK.

RHCP  🔥🔥🔥, I felt  Frusciante  is jamming  when I heard first time
Crazy that before anyone even sings you could tell its RHCP.
😍😍😍 they are back!!
Love how john still incorporates that hendrix dreamy vibe to his guitar work....very nice
Yep, he still got that Iggy Pop syndrome, aging gracefully upon the sunset.
Nothing like this lineup.
Thank the Lord above for some real music back in the charts
*This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen to it, I never get bored.*
Will Ferrell can sure play the drums.
Obrigado por voltar RHCP. Música boa pra alegrar tempos difíceis.
The early guitar solo is interesting
perfeição
I didn't expect to like this song but I really like it
Frusciante👏
Director: "Where do you want to film you video?" Rhcp:"Get it on"
I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve watched this
They have my heart forever.
GUYS POOLIX HATES DITTY PART 4
RHCP Raiz. Vem pro BR Caraio!
Good joob...
CTMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
When did Anthony get that accent
don't we all agree that the solo of John Frusciante in this song is just S.I.C.K. :)
This is amazing, this is so fresh and as if they haven't been away. Its so hard to keep it fresh yet still like their old style that we all know and love. Especially with all of todays music.
Can’t stop listening to this . Love the video too . So much
Awww shit… RHCP (the best of all 4) 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✌🏻
Did I spy a wild John? Great! But Anthony wore his shirt for _half_ of the video. Drat, so close.
¿O soy yo?, ¿o Anthony Kiedis trae el look de Tiger king?
12 millones en 6 días la gente quiere rock
Getting some serious Stadium Arcadium vibes. It's as if John never left. So glad they literally got the band back together
Which one of these RUSSIAN WOMEN will you choose? https://youtu.be/myU7IjKA7EU
Se eriza la piel, con esos acordes distorsionados! ❤️
Por Siempre Los Mejores 🖤🖤🖤🖤 Siempre con Su Estilo  Los Amo
This is a never released "Californication" song!
Cant wait for the tourrr !!!! See you in barcelona ❣️
Thank you so much for this! Long live to The Red Hot Chili Peppers
Eu amo uma banda!❤

Who else got chills listen too this...? It’s been 30 yrs since the band started and they’re still red hot 🥵
Combina com fifa
Amazing 👏
Frusciante fazendo a diferença !!! RHCP é foda.
Imagine the weeknd ft Red Hot Chili Peppers
Red Hot Eddie Guerrero
Legends this 4 in making music good
Can't wait to buy the World Tour ticket, see you guys in London!!!
Qué fucking mágicos son los pepers y la guitarra de Frusciante es otra cosa . . .
It's not a mistake, it's a masterpiece🌟
Yes all around!
The most special band ever. Their music is just something else... Who knows knows.
This song is like a time machine to my past and my teenage years... Thanks for that guys!
❤
Seeing RCHP Air Give it away on MTV as a kid, sitting here 30 odd years later still with the same Vibes. You guys are iconic!
what a song!
I know it wouldnt be rhcp without anthony but I hate him. He doesnt have any talent at all. He is just annoying
Great... Cant wait....
Fuck yeah peppers Killin it
ROCK ON!

oh yeah. it's John Frusciante 😎🔥🔥🔥
Did anyone else smile the moment they saw John Frusciante? And then again when that fuzz was turned on? Gosh this is good...
Wow!!!
Great to see John back and the band making new music again. Sounds a bit too similar to Stadium Arcadium era though to really get me super excited. Hopefully the rest of the new record has a bit more of it's own identity. Every album they've done with John has such a distinct and different vibe and sound to it I just hope it doesn't sound like Stadium part II. Needs to have it's own flavour like Blood Sugar, Californication, By the Way and SA. John's not usually one for wanting to repeat himself too often so fingers crossed they've gone somewhere new again.
Vivement le 8 juillet au stade de France
This song sounds like absolute shit. What's with the weird either bad Irish or even weirder pirate voice Anthony is doing? It's not good. Not at all.
Giants! 'Nuff said.
This is why I think they're the best band of the modern era- post 1980 onwards.  Even without Frusciante, the Getaway album was one of the best they ever did reflecting their tremendous growth in songwriting. Kiedis even said at the time, he felt there were some songs on the Getaway that were as good as anything else they did- Dark necessities, The Longest Wave, Go Robot and Encore were all timers ❤🙏🙏😍🎶🎉🌠💫
The 90's are back baby!!!!
Je öfter,je besser!
Nice Song
classico solo senior Frusciante, classico red hot....
Mais uma obra de arte
Lame, very lame. They played it safe for the fans.
Slk satisfação demais vem e escutar essas lendas do Rock🎸🤘🏻é um presente pra nova geração qui só escutavam as musica mais antiga,obg pó existe RHCP🎸💥🤘🏻
Simply the Best !!!
John Frusciante is the magic the Chili Peppers were missing for some time. His playing is so emotional. No other guitarist give me goosebumps like he does. I listen and mostly play metal but RCHP with JF is just plain magic.
Ouvindo de novo e de novo e de novo e de novo 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Why does Anthony Keidis look like Joe Exotic from Tiger King
that solo 🥲
нарешті
Respects from Russia! Yours songs always keep us warm!
Мои 100 просмотров для вашего видео. Очень рад за вас. Шикарно. Давно ждал новых песен. С уважением из России!
Estoy llorando
We’ve been waiting indeed. Get prepared for what’s coming..
Ojalá... La hubiera escuchado contigo... Entre tantas tardes juntos, esta canción nos pudo acompañar, ojalá que estés bien...
Какво по-хубаво от нова песен на редход Чили пепърс
Extraño mucho a Josh en esta banda, me partió el corazón como lo engañaron.
:))
Uhh q biennnnn locoooo, por fin una banda que saca algo nuevo pero fiel a su estilo de siempre, está tremendo!!!
I almost forgot this band for such a long time this band is something I never thought I would hear again but seeing this is honestly fantastic
ПАЦАНЫ ВАЩЕ РЕБЯТА
Pure happiness right now
Bravo!!!! Excelente!!!!
Why does Anthony sound like a mix between Matisyahu and an Irish folk singer?
It's so beautiful! Finally, the Peppers are back in action!
Amazing!
What's up with the Tiger King style, Anthony??? :-O Great song though!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🖤🤍
Se a banda RHCP for um corpo, John é a alma, que beleza presenciar esse cara tocando.
bastante gamer
Yes there back. Great song and video. RHCP always delivers. 💯💯💯💯💯💯
12 MILLION VIEWS IN 6 DAYS 🥴🥴🥴 THIS BAND STILL GOT THAT TOUCH ! ! ! ! !
Good to see Chad is still slowly transforming into Will Ferrell
Is it just me or the sound doesn't feel right? ... or that's the point?
Never ever once lost my love for these guys since the late 80s when I first heard them as a kid in 89' I believe. So glad John is healthy and playing with the gang and Chad, flea and Keid are all healthy and killing it with John. Love u guys.
So I’ve listened to this song in literal repeat a thousand times.   At first I despised it.  Anthony is singing some weird Irish accent and it’s just very odd.   The music is growing on me.   Let’s talk about the elephant in the video.  Anthony looks horrible.  Hideous.  Sickly.  I truly hope the rest of the album is better but don’t have high expectations.  I’m super happy John is back.  Hoping for the best really.
wow!!!  after all those years
la calidad se eleva a mil con Frusciante .. buena voz la de Luisito Rey xD
jesus how weak is this song
The energy doesn't suit the song for the video... it just doesn't feel right
This video is cringy
De vuelta reluce la complicidad que tenían con John ♥
They  back then?
Happy for this. Thinks
MINHA ESPERA VALEU A PENA. OBRIGADO!
It's so sad, when people said "omg RHCP is back"... John is legendary, i'm glad he is back, but really, Josh is amazing too!  Sometimes I get the feeling, people don't appreciate him and his playing just because he's not John. Some people probably wouldn't even find a difference, if they didn't know who is the guitarist. I love I'm with You and The Getaway. These albums are perfect!
This sounds like all the rest of their music,... which is cathartic & comforting,....
I want so hard listen this music in the beach whith my girlfriend, but I don't have I girlfriend and I live so far away of the beach
Gracias por este suave regreso, son magia y energía, los amo!
Anthony looks exactly like the character of "BRAD" from THE WOLF OF WALL ST.   Very cool - new album coming out...will be interesting.   Loved the signature J F  Solo - Missed that TONALITY / VOICE when he was on sabbatical this last round.
my god this song is amazing Welcome back boys:)
Am I the only one confused as to what everyone is seeing here? The intro and verse had me excited for great things and a return to form. However, the chorus is a bland chord progression with the vocal melody just following the guitar. It reminds me of the sort of thing a teenager writes as their first song when they're just learning...And then the solo just feels....pointless. It just copies the vocal melody without offering anything different or much in the way of dynamics. The first 30 seconds promise so much, and I could listen to it on repeat-but the rest of the song is just....kind of bland. Seriously hoping the rest of the record has something a bit more adventurous on it because I've been so keen for Frusciante's return!
frusciante!!!
Soo good bro, crying
The best band in the world
I fucking love u Guys,u Change my CovidYear .  I play rhcp 4life. ❤👏🏻☮
The struggle it's real when singer carries bass player on shoulders and sings at the same time! 🤣
Am i the only one who thinks That this Song is kind of boring (also for a First Single)?  I think the Hype of John‘s Return is blinding everyone so much.  But with That Said and Not to be too negative, i‘ll still be excited for the Rest of the Album!
Will Ferrell on drums!  Fuck yeah! ImI
RHCP forever
Fantastic! Would not have expected anything less! Keep going. We need your Mojo !
ROFLOL!!!!! It's HILARIOUS!!!! Is this a RHCP ROCK JOKE? Stop at 2:36. Check out the DYED mustache and hair!!! EL MUSTACHIO!!!!! MAYBE????? Tone it down a little? ADD in some gray? JUST FOR MEN? This is LAUGHABLE! What do these stupid lyrics even mean? The only good part is John Frusciante ripping out guitar rips. Flea and Chad filling in. John is the only good part of this though....EVERYTHING else is BLAH!!!!
love chili pepers
👍 he didnt said CALIFORNIA this time
love yu mucic wow ¡aaaaaaaa! wow love
Ouahhhh la Magie est toujours là. Et revoilà le son de Frusciante !! Du coup retour aux plus beaux morceaux !! Le Stade de France bientôt !!! J'ai trop hâte
nice haircut & nice song
Every octave change in the first solo completely  caught me off guard. I was like, Whoa (Keanu voice)!! 🤣
Rhcp is backkkkk Im literally dying
Amo por completo esta canción, Dios Frusciante volvió y con todo, batería de Chad siempre con ese sonido tan característico acompañado con el bajo de Flea, simplemente espectacular, no dejemos olvidado la grandiosa voz de Anthony, esto es RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, Red Hot está de vuelta!!!
Novo e nostálgico. OBRIGADO RHCP por ser Fantástico
No puedo dejar de escucharla 😍😍
Right on, I wonder if they took any inspiration from White Summer.
John 😃❤️
I love that John and Anthony haven’t aged since lik 2008 but Chad and flea look like fucking grandpas lol. Love them to death so happy to see John is back and I can’t believe they still sound just as perfect as the 90s
Welcome back, John.
I missed so much JOHN, It,s the best squad ever. I'm so happy to see all of You Guys. All Love :-*
💯👌🚀🕺🏼🤗😘
Best Red Hot Chili Peppers constellation, I love it ✌🔥😁
The legendary 4 are back🌶️
❤🙏❤🙏❤👍👍👍👍❤🙏❤🙏❤
Cool song!
I have literally had this on repeat for the last 6 days
LOS PUTOS AMOS.
always good to see the gang doing well
John be giving me those Keanu Reeves vibes lmaoo
If Moe from the 3 stooges had a love child with The Tiger King, Anthony could be their son Great tune
These guys never age... So does their music.
Rhcp...4 ever...4 ever.
Yeah... the soulless escense since by the way...
👽🤟🏻
Echando porro
Seeing John back is everything to me. Fully expected apathy but I loved this so much
Grande Dieguito Verdaguer.
It doesn't give any chill. Being a red hot chilli peppers fan for so long ,it is rare this happen.
Did he just say ‘sailing on a censor-ship’?  Guys, that’s… not good 🥲
PERFECT, PERFECT, THE MAN INS BACK!!!!!
🇧🇷👏🏻🇧🇷👏🏻🇧🇷👏🏻🇧🇷👏🏻🇧🇷
Nice to see Will Ferell still on the drums 🥁 👍🏻🤣😂🤣
Gives me stadium arcadium vibes
I'll go now against every comment... But this song is by far one of the blandest single they have ever released. Cannot believe that the same guys pushed out BSSM....
More than a song, a band exist
Atrapado en este mundo de tinieblas y reggaeton, nos ilumina un rayo de luz . Larga vida Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
JF is great, but way overrated
I really wanted this to be incredible but it’s such an average song. Hopefully the album is better!
feel like 90 .
What is Will Ferrel doing there?
Commentary on news stories during the covid pandemic? Or something else?
Anthony, I got used to the mustache. Now there’s a mullet? This is hard lol
Songs is the best..👍
People don’t judge Anthony’s vocals fairly. Obviously, he doesn’t have the physical voice talent of rock singers like Freddy, Axel, Cornell, etc. His talent is that he has a unique and dynamic style of singing, and never hesitates to get weird with it.   This weird accent he is doing here is just Anthony being creative and he has done weird things like this with his voice on many of their best songs in the past (Give it away tongue roll, non-sense/scatting parts on Soul to Squeeze and Around the World, deep voice on Snow, Especially in Michigan chorus, the short outbursts on By the Way).  His unique style fits perfectly with the seemingly limitless range of rock music john/flea/chad create. This song is classic RHCP.
It's like being thrown into the 90's and I'm young again. 🍻🍻🍻
GOD
Damn! This is awesome! Thanks for the ROCK!
What??? How is this released 6 days ago? I was listening to this thinking it was years old and didn't even notice. Great song!
Damn, yeah! That is the peppers spirit!!! I feel it!
Frusciante is back in RHCP
LOL @ YouTube advertising the RHCP concert in my hometown in August like I didn't get my tickets the day they went on sale.
🇲🇽
Emocionante .. RHCP 4 ever
Just where they left off
I feel old, but man, what a great song
Welcome back legend..!!🙌🙌
sexo
ジョンのメロウ且つハードなサウンドが、美しい旋律が、彼のあたたかい歌声が帰ってきた。 彼ら4人が動くと時計がまた瞬間を刻む。
Ese es el rhcp que conozco 👏
Conchatumadre cómo se nota la vuelta de Frusciante!! ❤‍🔥
What a great song. I hate getting old though.
Pre Programming for a summer of fires blakening the Australian sky for those that know.
WTF is Will Farrell doing playing the drums?
Californication
🔥😎🔥😎🔥😎😜🤟🏻
Que lastima, otra cancion que suena igual a las demas.....no traen nada nuevo y refrescante!
Nice guitar solo. The rest nothing great
Ya hacia falta algo asi🤘😎
This is what we call music. And I really mean music. We developed as human being but the music we have today is shit.
FEEL LIKE THE OLD DAYS
Amazing 🥰🥰🥰
its so bad
Kiedis: "I've been waiting!" Us: WE've been waiting. Glad ur back 👌
https://youtu.be/f2rJejqHU7Q
My God, this Kiedis dude does not age at all...
Este parte de mi vida ❤️... Me encanta rhcp, mi banda favorita por mas de 9 años ya... El feeling de john lo es todo, suena a chilli peppers 🔴🥵🌶️.. ❤️❤️❤️🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪..
If Anthony grew his hair long again I would lose my shit.
Anthony looks like Joe Exotic
Typically and Completely Red Hot Chili Peppers. 😁
R.H.C.P. idol
I hope other songs too rock with guitar solos, thumping drums and rap too
Damn that solo ... John is really back .. !!! 🔥🔥🔥
Now I know why Rick Rubin said he teared up listening to the four of them again. I love Josh and he’s incredibly talented but hearing John open the song and then seeing his strat at 0:46 sends me 💫
Não tem roupa no mundo que sirva pra escutar essa linda canção 😅 Eles estão chegando com tudo! John Frusciante é uma parte do asterisco do RHCP que faltava! E agora o som está lindo!
Nice! Still trash just making sure 👌
Its like Under The Bridge pt. 2. Boring.
There are so original bands in this world , where the absence of any member may have a profound effect on the whole band. RHCP is definitely one of them. The return of John Fruscianti has proved to be crucial to revive the sound we all know and love. They survived with Josh Klinghoffer but couldn't be as creative as the time they had with John, and that's because their songwriting process suffered without him. Welcome back!
🤘❤YESSSSSSS
Е бать копать, Джон вернулся!
เสียงไม่เปลี่ยนเลย รวมทั้งดนตรี  รู้สึกถึงคุณค่าเมื่อเราเจอกัน ฉันคือผู้ฟัง
My poor heart when I saw John Frusciante 💔💔💔. My Heroes are back together
John busts a massive guitar solo right after the first Chorus. They can do it.
🤘❤🎼🥰💋💋
Toujours fan de se groupe depuis petite
And just like that the prodigal son returns! Welcome back John.
Ufffff ahora que esta de vuelta john frusciante simplemente una obra maestra!!!!!
it's like a taste explosion
RHCP lyrics are like home...
Really waiting for this 2022 black summer to end
Nice! But is it me or does the lead look a little too much like Cletus from the Simpsons with this new style? ^_^'
I Red Hot sono il tuo migliore amico con cui non parli da anni per via di un litigio. Sono sempre lì, a ricordarti i bei momenti passati insieme, e lo fanno in 5 secondi. E dopo anni sembra siano passati solo pochi giorni.
Absolutely perfect guitar solo. Beautiful tone, soulful expression of the song itself, and not too self serving and showy offy.
Ууууррраааа!!! Ребята я вас люблю! Вы мое спасение в этом мире! Благодарю!
And just when you thought 2022 is gonna turn out as bad as 21, RHCP have dropped "Unlimited Love".🤟🤖
Never realised Thanos was the drummer for the chill's
LYRICS A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Maybe 30 years without doing a good song,empty music,this band died in 92
Mas de lo mismo ........predecibles y aburridos.
But...its winter....
NO PUEDO CREERLO , PT ESPERÉ POR AÑOS ESTO Y AHORA SI PUEDO MORIR EN PAZ <3 GRACIAS RHCHP
Is this 2006?? YES PLEASE
I think I should have listened before watching the video because even though it's so them it seems makes it seem goofy with all the arm movements and flea being flea kind of took my mind off the greatness of them being so good.
soso
THEY’RE BACK
Они просто охуенные! 🤘🤘🤘 Перцы, здоровья вам и вдохновения!
🤟🏻😜🤙🏻
Such a good song. Can’t wait for more
🔥🔥🔥
I have Burnt Orange on one side of my bedroom and the other side is Teal Blues....Sunrise and Sunset...Love and Light from Paradise in Washington State.
Deja vu
Why does it sound like Anthony Kiedis was attempting to emulate an Irish accent in this song? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Good classic sounding RHCP song.  👍🏻
Black hole sun won't she come
If they all just got up on stage and farted for an hour it would still go platinum !!!
Sip, masih sehat 😁 👍👍
❤️
How is it that John now looks younger than 15 Years ago. Stop doing drugs kids!

Amazing song. Great solo. Awesome band.
when did we time warp back to 1991?  This gave me goosebumps
Yeeeees ... RCHP is back ...
Anthony sings a bit strange in this song like english isnt his mother tongue
Los amo 💗
incrível.
Br Br ♥
Amazing!
This sound is freak 🤘🏻 https://youtu.be/oRMdjPWT4jk
eddie guerrero!!
Hit me now.
Классно!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hm.  Nice.
So great to see and hear John in the band again.  Great song!
BAPAK BAPAK GAUL XD
Shit, I heard new music was coming but I didn't think it would be any good. Glad to eat my words.
FRUSCIANTEEEEE :'vvvvv <3
🌶🥲Eb
More crappy pop circa by the way/stadium arcadium. i cant believe all these "rhcp are back!" comments. they left in 2002 and arent coming back. while this song may be an ok song, it does NOT sound like "classic" peppers. its just a pop song. flea doesnt stand out, the drums could've been a drum machine and theres zero funk (since 2002). the only thing ill say is anthony sounds good.
Ok...so I just crawled out from under a stone apparently? Is John F back with the band? Is the sun shining in my face? Is the beer buzz slowly making its way thru my body? Is the RHCP back for real???
Por favorrrrr🔥🔥🔥🔥 te amo John, los amo
Dire che è stupenda è poco ❤️
Welcome back John
Cara Red Hot é outro nível!  cade o 4K??
Josh was great for RHCP.. but no one could ever fill John's shoes. The chili peppers are back!!
Is Anthony trying to become the Tiger king?
I can't explain how glad I am that they're still rocking.
What kind of Paramore is this?  😂😂😂 I miss the old RHCP No offense, but they just aren't the same anymore.
🤘🤘🤘
Show demais, sou fã demais Br aqui hehe
I've been waiting!
You can be that old and still be cool
Es como si los dioses bajaran del Olimpo...😇😇😇😇
I think Anthony rules this.
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow. the old RHCP strikes back!!
Yeah let's dance like him...
Sailing on a censorship Waiting for another black summer to end.
I was really sad when Frusciante left the band in 2009 and was really happy when he returned, but I still can't get over that "sex offender" mustache that Anthony Kiedis is sporting.

Fiel a su estilo me re gusto el tema 🤩🤩
Meio chata, não gosto do Frusciante
This is SO GOOOD!
Songs like this make us walk like 15 years ago. Welcome  Johny! Viva RCHP
dyetee 'den bu yorumu beğenene rhcp tişörtü hediye gelsin.
Mi banda preferida de todos los tiempos
Everyone here talking about how RHCP manage to remain true to their essence - so true! And SO good to have John back!
This is a nice song by Jethro Tull.  I love retro music. 😜
Классно, рад что похоже вернулся Фрусчанте
Thank God, the return of real music!!!
Vengan a la Ciudad de México, por favor 🇲🇽 saludos..
When they com to Israel???🇮🇱
legend is backkkk
Shout out to John for growing his hair out again
Estoy orgullosa de vos John Frusciante!!!! te amo!!!
It's so epic to see the amount of attention this video gets.  RHCP for live!
Terbaik. Tak pernah tak sedap di dengar👍👍👍
John John John John!!
Cant wait to see these guys in September in Charlotte!
It's so good to see this. I miss the late 90's-00's 🖤
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer!
2:48 zyzz pose
My God, I hope the rest of the album is better than this!  The Getaway was great.  I’m with you sucked.  This song is a few few notches below The Getaway in this listener’s opinion
Puts, aquela sensação boa de prazer e quentinho dentro do coração, sabe? Que banda, que som!
Sounds like any song from Californication 🤨
Welcome back, John!!! 👋❤️
Yeeeaaah…legend is back
Frusciante is back and the magic is back!
That John solo in the middle of the song honestly melts my face! Feels like this is just what we need after a few shitty years. The kings are back 🙌
Потрясающе!!! Отличная песня!!!
Awesome!!! Great song!!!
Already a classic!  Can't wait for the album 🎵🔥
Frusciante sounds absolutely fantastic!
Surprised no one has tried cancelling them for having black in the title 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
So happy the fantastic four are back together....JESUS CAME BACK <3
I am so much delighted to see them united!
They keep it cool
Why does this sound like under the bridge backwards
Le seguo dagli albori.......  Grandiosi come sempre!!!! ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Songs form 1992 and songs from 2022 still sound like they are from the same album. RHCP never fail to bring their fans.
Great music! ยอดเยี่ยมเลยทีเดียว!
sweet sweet wet chorusy strat is back
Love the Chuckle Brothers
Quintessential Frusciante here in 2022. Not a brilliant song by any stretch but nice to hear John back with this sound, I will listen to the album and see how it goes.
I think I owe so much to this band that I could never pay them back. Thank you for everything.
Los amo😍😍😍😍
I miss john
🇧🇷
Years after years... And RHCP still RHCP!!! THe legend!!!!
I've been listening to these guys since the late 80"s...this is outstanding.  I can't wait to see them in August!
2022 is already insane
hell yeah baby
Zappa's back! 🤘🤣  Jokes aside - top stuff guys 🙏
Diego Verdaguer no murió
Frusciante's lookin like John Wick these days lol Pretty excited for the new album!!
The Wreck of the Edmund Poopgerald
Can we just stop and realize that Frusciante is back ?! It's absolutely amazing!   This is what we want !!!
I did an animated version of this. But I cant top this unique voice. This guy is a legend. 🔥🔥
Nobody has to age with trt
Frusciante justo donde debería estar 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Is that Will Ferrell on the drums?
My favorite thing about the Red Hot Chili Peppers is how low key they are about Will Ferrell being their drummer
the waiting is over!
Cut that mustache
Como en una capsula del tiempo. Suenan como antes, pero siempre frescos y actuales. Que pedazo de banda por favor!!!
ну хз... все стало какое-то однотипное
Yes fellas!!!
Always great to have New red hot chili peppers music
Фрушанте - Бог ! From Russia with love !
Isso que eu chamo de música de qualidade 😎🤘
😌🤘🙏🥰✌️
Meh
Red hot sendo red hot sempre, a essência permanece!
Finally
Te amo Frusciante
wtf man i feel like am back to 2002 when the real muisc was....thanks Red Hot Chili Peppers
Sounds like a Stadium Arcadium song
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤘🤘🤘
This song is a another master piece
love this song cant wait in the future to see a live version of this song
what's wrong with this song, why do I suddenly get a notification even though I'm not subscribed and even watching from this channel
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s always great to see Will Ferrell behind the drum set again
I've watched this countless times now and still cant figure out why flea is holding a can of  paint and brush
😎🎸
🥇 Black summer 🥈 Dani California 🥉Californication
John Frusciante is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TEMARDO
Dear lord, I thought I'd never see it! But here they really are back! Sounds great and like the old Chilis, but anyone else notice the song is missing John's backing vocals?
So Anthony Kiedis turns 60 this year🤯🤯👍🏼💪🏼
Jackass 4 and red hot chilli peppers, loving the timemachine rn
It's so good to hear this! Thank you so much!
I love how they revealed John by showing his 62 strat  first as a buildup before they show his face
You guys are just great man...
This sounds like crap
John sounds awesome as always
life is good. i feel younger today than last week. thank you guys.
Didn’t know that Will Ferrell can do that! Go brooo!
Как же Я рад вас снова видеть! Вернулись и создали хит! Перцы вы лучшие!!!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Menacing  ゴゴゴゴ
This made me cry! happy tears
good to see that "band" still matters...love you anthony,flea,chad and john, welcome home.
I'm pretty sure I've contributed to 1mil view alone, banging tune.
Thanks to John for coming back, this sounds amazing!
Brano banalissimo, buttato lì giusto per riaffacciarsi sul mercato...distanti anni luce da Californication...
Anthony made more 666 hand signs in this video then Trump made in a speech...they clearly sold their souls a long time ago back in the blood sugar sex magik days like most mainstream bands and singers.
I've loved these dudes for 30 years and still love them.
Black summer tem uma sonoridade que lembra muito os sons produzidos no álbum Stadium Arcadium, o retorno do John Frusciante deu um up no Red Hot Chili Peppers. Falando da poética da canção, fica evidente que o Anthony Kiedis está fazendo menções ao atual momento pandemico em que estamos passando. Fiz uma análise minuciosa dessa música no meu canal, quem se interessar é só ir lá sacar =)  https://youtu.be/o4PSgakPoVs
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Red hot é som q arrepia . Mais uma pedrada !
Can we take a moment to acknowledge the amazing shape Anthony Kiedis is in for a 60yo?
John Frusciante  It's like the heart of the band, and Kieds and the rest are the other vital organs. RHCP can't live without them all
Jesus is back!
This is history, and I was here
Now guitar solos are relevant again.
Nice!  \m/
se nota la presencia de  John Frusciante , te traslada fiuuuuuu
Que energia fora do normaaaaaaal!!! Obrigada por voltar, Frusciante... você fez falta! Ansiosa pelas outras músicas!! Amo demaaaaaaais uma banda!! PS: vem pro Brasil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Peppers are back! Yahoo!!
Keep in mind that Anthony Is almost 60 years old and still looks like a average late 30s year old person
Sounds like Red Hot Chili Peppers but doesn’t sound exactly like another Red Hot Chili Peppers song. I instantly heard the melody and it sounds relevant in todays music world. Pretty amazing I have to say
Adoro quando John Frusciante está na formação!
A pastiche of a RHCPs song covered by the RHCPs very modern.
Oooof that autotune right off the bat was rough…I know it’s commonplace to use it but ouch! Still a nice song tho.
God it’s songs like this that I wish were much longer than they really are. I needed this. Thank you all.. truly.
Honestly, I didn’t expect this to sound so good. I guess John Frusciante’s return has made this sound just as awesome as the early stuff. Amazing!
It is amazing , thanks You for this new song. And welcome again John Frusciante the unique.
Good song! But why is Frank Zappa shirtless most of the time?
The guitar in this is just amazing. Love it
Песня отличная,  а вот клип..... Как то не вяжется видеоряд с динамикой самой песни. РНЧП НАВСЕГДА!
Based
Unpopular opinion: this is in the top 5 of their songs
RHCP are Back!
Who is here
I have been a fan since mother’s milk, still good after all these years.
めちゃカッコイイーーー‼️
I didn’t know the Tiger King had such a nice voice!
Anthony Kiedis turns 60 this year ! :o with almost 60 years you can publish such a cool song again, you are only as old as you feel.
RHCP is back
How? How the fuck are they still this good? How??? 😮‍💨
Тільки нагадайте собі скільки шановним перцям років... Красунчики, любов
THE BEAST IS BACK
Шикарно 🙂

3:08 sounds a lot like "This is the place" outro from By the way
Awesome sounds great good old chilli's xxxx
Really growing on me. Can't wait for the album
Damn, Will Ferrell is such a good drummer.
Black summer. Is this song about the 2020 riots?
Imagine the sensations of being together, the eyes must have been wet and boom a hit like before ! You close your eyes and you're in the 90s, perfect.💪💪❤️
A música é boa mas falta alguma coisa
10.02.2022 91 times since release :)
КРАСАВЦЫ!!!
Love it 😊😊😊
Старички сделали очередной шедевр💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
thk God for u guys.. longlive RHCP
Glad to see you again!
What a stupid charity song.. even die hard fans are walking away from this one
Frusciante 🔥
I Love this song ! Red Hot Chili Peppers is Back !!
It's amazing how familiar their music feels, even after such a long time. Feels like coming home. This is so good.
This cant be real
Why dose fle have a paint tub
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING REAL MUSIC BACK 👏 R.H.C.P.
Good old school vibes, which remind me of "Under The Bridge"
I like the way we can't explain the vibe, the energy who can exist between a group of people. Thank you guys.
Finally the Peppers with a LEAD guitarist again!
Buenisimooo
Amazing ,these legends still got it ,,,,,after being away for so long and came back with this master piece,is just wow,thank you RHCP God bless you.
Olhando pelos comentários, vc observa o tanto de BR que é fã desta banda. Por favor, merecemos uma apresentação suas aqui, quem sabe se não for pedir muito em Belo Horizonte. Quem concorda?
Blood Suger sex magic still one of greatest albums ever IMO.
It's 2022 but it likes '99
Ficou muito irada lembra bastante o Californication
Легенды)
Sounds like a b-side track from Californication era. Thank you guys! Good song!
Ya ben ağlicam galiba FRUSCİANTE seni bir daha burada görmek kadar güzel bir şey yok bebeğim :').
oh how much we love the old rock and roll. Thankyou Anthony, Flea, John, And Chad. You guys are always there for ROCK AND ROLL and so are we!!
Just proves how important Frusciante is to the RHCPs. It's like they got their heart back ❤
Only red hot chili peppers can upload and get 11m views in 6 days🤯
this is what RHCP supposed to be with john frusciante in the band
Uma música nova que parece um sucesso de anos já  kkk surreal
음악이 매우 잘 익었어요!

ЭрХаЧэПэ форева

So many "Californication" vibes on this tune... Brings back emotions from 22 years ago (and beyond)... :)  Well done and thank you, Red Hot Chili Peppers ;)
Frusciante
Great to see Will Ferrell back on the drums ..
Hell yeah! Just what the doctor ordered - a good dose of our favorite Chili recipe to spice it up again
After all those years the chili still spicy

Твою мать они вернулись...Продолжаю жить продолжаю
Apaixonado por esse som 🔥🤘🏼
Maravilhosos como sempre😍💚💛💚💛
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Impazziscoooooooo 💥☄️⚡️🪐🔥♥️😜🤙🏻🤩🕺🏼💃🌈☝️😽♥️ I love you forever
Welcome back John. I love ya. You were an asshole to Josh. But I love ya
It is good
very very signature tone :)  like it
Noldu la paralar suyunu mu çekti? Şaka şaka iyi ki geldiniz :)
Bom dms mano, eles são nostálgicos isso ajuda dms a música sair boa...
Sono tornati...con Frusciante sono veramente loro... Leggende 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn will ferrel is really good at drums
I love you so much, UNLIMITED LOVE ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSSSS
Legit can't stop listening to this
Ред хоты Ван Лав! Их не берет возраст🔥 минимализм и похуизм все в меру🤘
เพราะอย่างแรงครับผม
Doesn't have that 80s vibe like Mother's Milk, Uplift Mofo, so hard to capture that again? It's close to BSSM but it's the pretty bland stuff theve been doing since Californication
is this a parody?         good one   lmaol
zzzzzzzz   from california  zzzzzzz      no way!   move on!
OG Peppers!!!!! F YA!
I didn't know Will Ferrell was in the Chilli Peppers 😆
It's new.. but man it took me back right👌🏻
Вы красавчики! Бро! You are cool 😎🔥 Thank you for your great music through the years! We really are grateful! Take care, guys 🙏
super!
Salut dengan RHCP tetap kompak
I got goosebumps all over my body while listening to it. 🖤
Mulai SMA Sampek sekarang 🤩 Yang Dari indonesia mana fans RHCP 🔥🔥🔥
i tried so hard to try enjoying their music, i just cant
its winter bro
Cool video, great job guys!
สมกับที่รอคอยมาหลายปี
EMEEEEEZZZIIIING.......
Why does Anthony need to ruin every chili peppers song?
Finalmente son tornati❤️❤️
Thank you RHCP for sticking around when so many others kind of didn't.  For a brief moment I went back to my mid 2000s school years, of getting introduced to sounds like these, while I was listening to this brand new work, thank you for that as well.  Love from India.
Had a feeling JF was gonna return
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P67CeotxkE
Classic ☮☮☮
got it after 3rd time listening! woohooo! they're back again!
I’m just so happy John Frusciante is back, he ties together that RHCP sound that I know & love!!
issa nu tempura da matfuso
Love this sound!!! The beat is so much like Californication, but the harmonies are "Raindance Maggie'. The guitar is all John Frusciante and its just spine tingling! It's melting my soul!!  Holy fucking shit! THE CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK!!!
Coooooooooool)
YALL ON SOME DRUGS BRUH 🤣
Would like to dedicate this to all the RHCP lovers who didn't live enough to listen this song.  Rock n Roll in Peace ✌
All RHCP songs sound the same..They just change a chord here and there...
Still making the same 2 albums going on 45 years.
nashiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Wow!! This is Borderline Transcendal Shit!! 😘👌
Goosebumps!!
Welcome back John Frusciante!
Oh that's why they are my favorite band.  Thanks for the reminder.  Awesome song.  Going for a 4th listen now.
Love the whole music video. Especially Flea doing what Flea does best. Jamming out and  jiving like a rock n roll pied piper.
GOOSEBUMPS!
Tellement de douceur dans cette musique... J'adore, red hot n'a pas bougé avec toutes ces années
So happy to see John
Auto tune killed the vibe of the vocals, especially at the beginning. Come on Kiedis, you're better than that! Tell the producers to fuck off and leave it untouched. Imperfections are what gives it feeling.
60 years old sure aint what it used to be, sheesh!
I've been waiting !!
I'm happy and just that John plays guitar again
WTF, Anthony wants to be the new Tiger King???
Fucking right doggie that's some good cake.
About damn time
John is backkkk
2011? 2016? Never heard of em'
Red Hot Chili Peppers are always so good.
And the riff sound so much solid than old tones of usual john's effects..
Happy to see Frusciante reunites with them...
Fandamnphuckingtabulous!!!!!!!!! ❤❤
John Frusciante. Welcome back
RHCP still kick ASS yeah 🤘🇺🇸✌️🙌👏❤️🥁🎸🇦🇺
what a great song.... this remind me of Slow Cheetah
Very boring solo
I haven't been this happy since Iron Maiden dropped _Writing on the Wall_
Best song ever 🔥🔥🔥
JOHN Frusciante!!!!!!!!
Fuck yeah! RHCP for life!!
Oh John,.... Im glad I got to witness your reunion
What sorcery is thissssss?!?! 😍
Regardless I've waited 5 or 6 years for this by now so I'm sure its gonna be fucking legit
Red hot chilli Lo de diario 😅
This for the most part is amazing as the majority of their work is, but the chorus, in my opinion is a little weak compared to a much stronger song. And wtf is this weird accent thing Anthony's doing to emphasize on some words
uauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
Que alivio ver a Diego verdaguer sano y salvo hasta con nueva faceta de rockero
This is what we needed, thank you
geus karolot tp angger keren,mantap 👍
36,877🙌🏻👌🏻🤟🏻
Punk funk is alive!!
finalmente musica nova é boa nostalgia bateu
Why does he have a Scottish accent lmao
John Frusciante is back🔥
Their mental age is incredible. At 50-60 to rock out and jump and run around like youre 20 is mind blowing to me. My dad is 60 and barely gets off the couch.
yeah, Assange is being censored, good thing the Peppers mentioned him, oh wait, they DIDN'T!  Phony comes to mind...
Yeaaah The Chili Peppers💪💪💪💪💪 I've been waiting
Arrepiado 🤘
There is nothing quite like the lineup of Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Flea, and Chad Smith. Their synergy is truly magical. 1988-1992, 1998-2009, 2019-present.
John my favorite guitarist!!!
John definitely hates this
pqp eu amo muito!!! ❤️
Red Hot Chilli Peppers its back baby!!!
RHCP ❤️ Still Original, still going strong
This sounds like otherside and Californication. I love it
RHCP lineup:  Anthony Keidis - vocals Flea - Bass Will Ferrell - Drums Keanu Reeves - Guitar  Guys, we got two acting legends in the band now.
The drummer is definitely Will Ferrel
Están de regresooo!!!
❤️❤️🔥🔥❤️❤️
Is this will ferrell behind the drums?🤣
A melhor banda de rock do mundo na atualidade, sem dúvidas.
John Frusciante nasceu pra tocar com os caras, sem mais
💖
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
UF 👌💖
I am somewhat responsible for the 11.5 + views!!!
"China on the dark side of the moon" 🤘🔥🔥
Just like Dark Necessities , it gets better with time. Not great on first listen but.
1:52 one of the song parts waiting for a decade
I was hoping for more vocal harmonies.
This could use more backing vocals from John
me parece excelente!! para que la generacion actual pueda disfrutar de la magia de Frusciante!!
This is a red hot chilli peppers track all the right ingredients mixed together well this is how you cook up something good K.I.S keep it simple
Who is still listening to this incredible band in 2022?
Kung Fu panda got high
I'll never forget getting harassed at work for wearing RHCP tee shirt in the late 80s early 90s after listening to them for years while in L.A. and these guys are still pumping out great music. Always grateful to the Peppers for being there through my life 🌶
It's good to see the Peppers turn back. The music sounds like "Rivers of Avalon" and "This is the Place"
Bendita música...excelente... gracias por seguir RHChPp!
Their best song
Los amo maldita sea... Me salvaron en una etapa de mi vida cuando sentía que el mundo se acababa... Y gracias a ustedes y su música, tomé el camino que ahora camino día a día y es bueno. Esta nueva canción me hace senrit que siguen vivos, latiendo dentro de mi corazón....
This dude is pushing 60, but barely looks a day old since the 90s.
Después de esta canción mi vida se ha prolongado unos años más ✨🌶️
FRUSCIANTE ISS BAAAACKKKKKK
🙃🥲y'all 👋🏻
Mantaap
*Incredible energy!* What a vibe song
As times passes...the singer is looking more like  Machete 🤣
someone could make a really funny music video of this with the BLM riots of 2020
Suena como canción de Metallica pero la batería es de Otherside y puuuuf obra maestra gracias por rescatar la música.
Yess Frusciante is back.. im back to you again RHCP 🤘😂
Los kago amando lpm
omg welcome back!
por dios no puedo parar de ver y escuchar esto.... volvieron los chili peppers!
Straight banger
love the chili peppers, their best song!
Disappointing like top 40 pop just my opinion I was expecting something a bit funkier
Tem algo errado... Não que isso importe, mas quantos anos eles têm? Estão mais envelhecidos que meus pais! 😳
I think this is the best single they’ve released since Californication.  I’ve loved every album since then, some more than others.  If the rest of the songs are as thoughtful, melodic, and poetic as this one, then we’re in for a real treat.  The song goes in directions that seem predictable, but is far from it.  Every development in the song is a perfect surprise, and every instrument is captivating, even the oversimplified drums, perfect for the song, and grabs your attention for that very reason.    I don’t know how they manage to be the same old chili peppers but give us something so fresh, enjoyable, and relevant.  Flea and John are at their best in unison here.  And Anthony’s voice continues to ascend.  His maturation went overlooked on the Klinghoffer albums.  But yes, he’s continued his ascension here.    I’ve listened to the song hundreds of times now and it’s latched on to my soul.  I’ll get to bookmark this time in my life with the moment I first heard Black Summer.  Great stuff... this album could top their top albums something hard to do.  Only the Beatles can write this many awesome songs and get better with age.
you guys are my real stoner jam
Classic yet fresh and relevant, well done boys!
เพลงอย่าง​เท่เล​ยครับ​พี่​
Wow!!! I love it so much and am so happy John is back! So beautiful!
I don’t know why but this kinda gives me This Is Spinal-tap vibes.
Wow. Fantastic song! First time in ages I heard a really great new song!
The Lyrics
2secs in and it''ll never not be played over and over.
✨🌃🌆🔥😎
We’ll come back Red Hot Chili Peppers I like all your music.
YEAAAH FRUSCIANTE IS IN THE HOOOOUSE
👑👑
Ah they hired John Wick as the guitarist
Man for play guitar is John Wick
LA is in an apocalypse
<3
Keanu Frusciante
El solo de Frusciante ♥️
This makes me so happy....I've loved growing up with these guys
Gran Diego Verdaguer
Like a dumb joke or bad heartburn.
Do they use Californication as the main riff of this song?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
🐐🐐🐐
Sou Fã da banda desde pequeno 😃
I like this, but what's with the weird, exaggerated Irish accent?
Josh Klinghoffer is a hell of a musician. But there is nothing more nostalgic than seeing these 4 together playing again!!
https://youtu.be/TVJ7L_axSXw
Overrated band! They need to be put in the 'Easy Listening' section. They're too accessible, no edge and just like Foo Fighters, full of insta-melodies.
Энтони Кидис в свои 59 лет-в отличной физической и творческой форме,как и все остальные участники группы!Браво,парни,рос на вашей музыке ещё в 90-х,вы-просто живые Легенды,желаю как физического,так и творческого долголетия всем участникам группы,ваша музыка-великолепна!
PQP!!!!!! Agora voltou aquela essência do RHCP. muito bom.
Get   it Flea 🎸
Frusciante miss you!! the red hot are back
Scar tissue vibe but more heavier
Anthony’s dance moves are sickening
If you came here to listen to this I LOVE YOU, you know music
John♥️
This dude never disappointed, great to see their come back still with their unique sound and style
anthony se parece ahora a Iggy Pop
Son la mera verga
2 of my favorate band korn and RHCP new album 2022.
RHCP
Ya se les ve el paso del tiempo en el rostro . Pero buenos músicos!
Why does Anthony have an Irish Canadian accent?
Frusciante hermanito mío te amo
11m  days 5
Increíble regreso de esta legendaria banda, que buen rolón 💥💯🤩
This was aight
It’s alr
THIS IS WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-{>
❤️❤️❤️🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Grandeeeeeee  Diego Verdaguer
Oh my fuck this sux...
The music industry is over !!!!!! Thank God for RHCP .....Forever XXXXXX
Olha como esse quarteto se tornam mágicos juntos? Que maravilha Jonh, isso aí vivo vai ser muito criativo da parte de vocês!!
With great love from Russia, thanks for the video and the song! John, welcome back!
I was underwhelmed at first but it grows on me. Good vibes. I look forward to the record and all the b-sides(they recorded 50 tracks!)
The guitar twang The drum roll The Flea bass The lyrics The melody  This is the proper definition, non-sjw definition of safe space  Can't go wrong with RHCP baby
"Waiting on another Black Summer to end"  "Waiting for Frusciante to rejoin the band"  #welcomebackmellowshipslinky
Esse solo dessa guitarra ficou desgraçadamente muito foda!!!
Proof positive that chemistry in a true sense is real. Take away even only 1/4 of that makeup and it changes the whole stew. I like all of the Chili Peppers material but this is the real deal Chili Peppers here. They added the John ingredient back into the Peppers and now the stew is cooking.
Great Song!! ✍️🍃
Love you guys so much. Can’t wait to see all of you on tour and among the cosmos. Best wishes for 2022 and really hoping Josh is ok.
Thank you. Rhcp.
Son muy grosos todos.....excelentes...temazo
LOVE IT. THEIR BACK!!
JOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:48 I thought that was Keanu Reeves for a second.
GREATNESS HAS RETURNED
🖐🏻Hello
Grande RHCP espero poder verlos en vivo ,ojalá lleguen a Perú :'c
❤️🧡 💛💚💙💜🤎,🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥
fantastic
Same sound, 👍
Red hot chilli FERRAS
Love em.
I swear I keep hearing china or vaginas on the moon
Is it China or vaginas on the moon?
Like a fine wine..
increíble
Faaa buen tema 👏👏👏
O Flea com um adesivo do Lenin, líder soviético, colado no baixo, nao poderia esperar menos. Baita som.
FRUSCIANTE ❤️
Frusciante back 😍😍😍
Damn.. I needed this.
Eleven million souls being blessed by this tune ar this day! GIANT BAND...
It's a known fact that the longer you keep chili peppers the hotter they get.
The drum beat is exactly the Californication beat.
Probably the best guitarist and bass player alive
Acertaram em cheio, que saudade estávamos deste RHCP, que som raíz, que timbre lindo do Jhon, ELES VOLTARAM 😍🥰😍🥰😍
It's wonderful, thanks John for back!!!!
Me sorprende mucho que Anthony no haya cambiado su voz durante todos estos años, sigue igual de limpia
As soon as I found this I pre ordered the new album, cant wait.
Only thing missing is Josh on either backing guitar or keys!!! I think Josh's subtle playing style and difference in how he attacks or thinks as a musician is distinct for sure in his own right. At the very least he could have been a valuable asset even just being in the studio and adding his personal touch in the background. #BringJoshBack2022 #JoshNJohn #RHCPWeDeserve
If y’all haven’t done your research on the Unlimited Love vinyl record that’s in the video’s description, there’s only 10,000 copies on the record. So buy it now before it sells out. If I were y’all, I would keep it in the packaging. 10,000 copies is kind of rare. Also, I wouldn’t open it because that vinyl is like a heart to me. It’s very fragile, it brings my soul to life, and it has feeling to me. That’s why I always collect things and make sure they’re safe cause when I collect things, it’s like a time capsule full of good memories of my past and I’d love to share my experiences with the kids of the future and show people that the world is not such a bad place after all.
I want to go see them this summer but only if they play I could have Lied and John actually remembers his best solo his done production wise. But, I know that’ll probably never happen so I guess I’ll just catch up on youtube. Lol
Stop everything, Frusciante is back!!!!
Red Hot Chili Peppers is BACK !
Will Ferrell on drums!!
Finally ! 2022
Recuperaron su esencia mis viejos amigos 😢😢😢😢
god dam you guys look so cool together
Will Ferrel on drums🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Muito igual mano!

Instant fucking classic Anthony brother man thank you I think you just saved my year man for real thank you so much 🥲😢🥲😢🥲
It's good to be back...need more..
👏👏🥲👏👏

WHO SHOULD OPEN FOR RCP NEXT? Meet Liliac. Covering Holy diver . . .      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPfNs_N9nE4
COOL!
Love them...still sound amazing after so many years in the game....❤🎶🎧🎤❤
Yeah man!!! Chili Chill. It's been a pleasure aging with these cats! Their vibe just maintains...
Ireland's finest!
A cada vez que se ouve essa música ela vai ficando melhor braba
YES YES YES
sounds like something straight out of Stadium Arcadium     AND I LOVE IT
Tu peux flex ce que tu veux... ça vaut pas la mois bonne
F*ckin Classic RHCP....mofo's stiill got it ❤
Encore une histoire d'impôts
I mean.. it's OK.. it's like their old stuff. And, he should shave his tickler and grow his hair long. he looks a little creepy
Josh is watching this. Crying, That chat must have been tough.
Josh was good but i feel like RHCP's soul has returned. I can't wait for the new album.
RHCP FOREVER. 🔥
Wow wasn't expecting this track to be so legendary. This is a shot of adrenaline ,the guitar solo is like a creative explosion
I can make view count +500.000 in a year alone was just thinking that :D
Sempre será minha banda favorita! RHCP❤️
I love this band so much. Welcome back Fru! Long live the Chilli Peppers!
🌊🌊🌊
Kiedis is just awful.
legends as they go, behind the sun is where all the dragons went to wait for the right time to return, hay!!!
Love it!!!!😍
Larga vida a Frusciante!! Intactos estos muchachos 🌶🌶🌶🌶
where is the cool western movie that goes with this song...
Oq q o jonh wick tá fazendo ai?
God is back
Que felicidade ver essa banda junta de novo!
My man Anthony will grow old to turn into some indie version of an improved Iggy Pop
COMO EU AMO ESSA BANDA MEU DEUSSSSSSSSS
This song made me cry. John is back. Times haven't gone through in vain, its a worthwhile.
John ta on !
Que música 🎧 incrível 🤩
フリーがおもろ過ぎてソロが入ってこんwww
Gran rola!! tiene toda la esencia de siempre, y se siente también moderna y con madurez. El retorno de Frusciante es notable, empata perfecto como en sus grandes tiempos. Gran manera de antojar y prometer para su nuevo material.
go to buenos aires......
RHCP is back!!!!
Awesome, WE fuckng needed this. todays music is SHIT.
I needed this badly...some semblance of normality..I feel like I haven't heard a good rock song in years....luckily artists like micheal Kiwanuka..leon bridges and Chris Stapleton have kept me going recently...but I really needed some of this right here...I need some soul with my guitar
We’ve all been waiting for another black summer to end
Not sure about the mustache but everything else is on point
I needed this. Humbles me with all the Covid bull crap.
Give me kirim,, I 🙇
My neighbor Mike just heard this for the first time.. his reaction→ "very cool, beautiful even" high praise from him. He's unbearably grouchy
cant belive red hot are back SUCH A SONG MY  GOSH
Qué lindo verlos con Frusciante lpmadreeeee 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
Loving it!
For a group that always professes to be in the studio experimenting and evolving their music, this song doesn’t sound like much of an evolution or different sound from their last 3 albums.  It sounds like it could have been written during Stadium Arcadium or I’m With You.  I still love them though.
This was awful, just like the new Ghost, wtf is happening to my fave bands...hoping the album isn't this bad.
❤️
🇧🇷 que música boa. #forabolsonaro
one of the bands that I have listened to since childhood jeden z zespołów słuchanych przeze mnie od dzieciństwa
Welcome to the banquet
Is that Will Ferrell drumming?😂
Obrigado por estar de volta a casa Frusciante!!!
Great song, i love it !!!!! 👏👏
🔥
I think it s good
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al Olimpo
Good to see John back! rock on!
LOVE it!
Can't wait for "Unlimited love" full álbum 🔥✌️🌶️  Just 2 months for listen it  Vivan los RHCP 🌶️🔥🌶️🔥🌶️🔥🌶️🔥🌶️🔥🌶️🌶️🔥 SALUDOS DESDE COSTA RICA 🇨🇷🇨🇷🇨🇷🌶️
Anthony still rocking that hot body 😍🤩🥰
No pierden esa chispa  Eso es en escencia  RHCP 😪 Ojalá un día pueda verlos en vivo😰
It’s amazing after all these years and will Ferrell is still playing in the band!
This is me noticing that Chad Gaylord Smith looks like Will Ferrell for the first time.
♥
Can't wait for the new album... soooooo happy to hear this news!!!!!
top top john!!!
Glad to see Will back on the drums <3
Seeing Will Ferrell back on the drums is awesome
Did Josh write the guitar parts? I read that they were already almost finished with the new album with John rejoined.
When is he gonna shave that stache?
I've been playing this non stop all day cuz this is amazing and with frusciante back is making everything more awesome
Soooooo glad  To see John back but its gonna take me one hot minute to stomach Anthonys haircut.
UNOS CAPOS!!! GRANDE FRUSCIANTE
McFly et Carlito love you
The Red Hot Chili Peppers is so unique that you can recognized a song is theirs when you heard it.
Excelente rola, como siempre. Inconfundibles y únicos los Red Hot Chili Peppers...
Grandes los peppers muy buena su musica
Essa semana juro que pensei" quando meu Deus que o Red Hot vai lançar uma nova música??? 😱😱😱
Waiting for another black summer to end. They put my feelings toward all this crap to a song. Art in it's TRUE form. Deep yet very inspiring. I love this!!
Their sound is on point, love this song it’s a banger!!
Literally one of my favorite bands. Me and my friends would in middle school and high school would ride our bikes around listening them while we smoked weed and stayed out of trouble. Lol. So glad they are back. Love Anthony Kiedus and crazy ass Flea.
Well this was a bright spot in whats  been a really shitty time for me.  Thanks boys.
Bravo!
Frusciante!👏🙌🙌🙌
So nice..
Los mejores un abrazo fuerte desde Colombia
Love RHCP
Anthony had some crazy haircuts during his career, but this mullet and moustache 😂 80's vibe
im in 10's   bro what a vibe   love for u guys
Uufff y aún con los años siguen demostrando de que están hechos. El rock nunca muere solo rejuvenece 👌. Temazoo
❤️
Wow, this is soo bad, some bands just need to stop. This is a fume of what RHCp once were
Looking forward to their UK tour..
This sucks
uhuuuuu Brasil aqui!
About time Frusciante went back home to the rhcp!! You guys always come out with the most amazing music... rock on🤘
Idols!
Love the Chilis since Mothers Milk, but I gotta say Keidis is looking a bit like Iggy Pop (with a mullet and a stash) lately lol. No disrespect to either one. Both legends. 😁
It feels good to hear Johns Strat again. But let‘s take a moment and think about what Josh did for this Band aswell. He also had no big problem with leaving the band for John. Big respect for Josh 🌶 Richtiger Ehrenmann
Still funky fresh, after all these many years. Rock on, rock out, my dudes✌
🥰
Wonderfull ‼️‼️‼️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful 😍
Man ive been a fan through a lot of stuff, but this kinda sucks. They take themselves too seriously n this is just the same repetitive shit
Frusciante makes this band!
Anthony is crazy as hell. It's one thing to just mess around and use that accent but no this motherfucker puts it in the actual song lol.
we can call him father father playing band
they still got it
DIEGO VERDAGUER.....FOREVER....
Is this song about Chinese censorship?  Holy shit bro I think it is.
Good to have John back where he belongs.
Anthony really likes been shirtless, great tune btw
John just completes RHCP.  Dave and Josh were great, but John is legendary.
классные усы
Shit hot as always 😁
Glad I'm here for the second coming of RCHP
Song should have been called "Nostalgia Overload" My brain cannot comprehend how classic yet modern this amazing track sounds
😍😍😍😍
Has anyone read Anthony's autobiography?   His journey is amazing and it's a miracle he's even alive today.    He's a total inspiration and this song is incredible.   I am so proud of this band.  💝
so I see we're having some desecration smile's vibe here...
TK'S RHCP <3 I LOVE YOU!
fooooda
♥♥♥
una NUEVA ROLA 🎸🔥🔥🔥de estos Manes... pe al que se lo ve MAS VEJETE🥸 es al Antony... los otros estan POLLITOS  🧒🤟😂😂
❤️
Ya se percataron que nadie le a dado 👎🏻 a pesar de tantos años no paran de crear música nueva, la mejor banda que existe!
Don't know why but It song bring to me some memories of  "Hey Joe" (Jimi Hendrix)
This band sounds better evertime
1:11 All subjects of Ymir hear me! My name is EREN YAEGER !!!!!!
Beautiful chord progression in the verses, everything else compliments it so well too
Fuck, that was seriously boring.
Frusciante is like a rolling stone that came back from his journey after exploring his own sound, and bringing a refined style to the band once again
Yeah Baby, rocking tune, so happy these guys haven't lost a step.  Smokin'
Just bought tickets in Boston. Love that the boys are back!
Sad to can't see her in Paris 2022 😢😢
¿Existe algo que los RHCP no hagan bien?
Needs more of Fruciantes backing vocals.
Ufff!!! Simplemente excelente canción, una agrupación que se mantiene vigente, original a su esencia y fiel al Rock and Roll 🤙🏼😎⚡ Bendiciones y éxitos for ever!
my favourite men
wtf , deborah chow ? same director for the mandalorian ? lol
So f'n badass...
A salor spoke too sewn and china's on the Dark side of the mewn  They took errr jobs
Yaayyyyyyyy!!!
Mantaaap rhcp !!!! From  🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
John  Frusciante is a master.  They should rename the song terrible mustache what the hell Anthony? Lmfao😆
After all these years RHCP still amazing!! Another great song...sounds like cowboy times.
Happy to be alive to hear this ! Thank you JF !
More More More
Three original members whose one turned 60 in October and the rest who will turn 60 still kicking butt.
Viva RHCP! Glad the classic sound is back
YA SIÉNTESE SEÑORA¡!
John Frusciante sounds like Jimmy Hendrix
Nice to see after all the years, you can tell a red hot chilli pepper song from a mile off. Loving the vibe of the tune
Josh = Jalapeño - John = Carolina  (level of Chili Pepper)
RHCP argentina 2022? pleaseee
This song feels so safe and unimpressive to me coming from rhcp. It's very flat and unmemorable to me. I hope they've come up with more better songs in their new album
Yeah, baby!
Is that autotune in some parts?
1:52 John.
Owh dear, this song is just another reason why i'm the biggest RHCP fan. Might have to get another RHCP tattoo from pure excitement of the next album O.o
sick song
RHCP IS BACK!!!??? BRAZIL HERE CARALHO!!
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer. Loved the song!
1:51 WELCOME BACK JF, I MISSED YOU MAN
Amazing..... Can't wait for Londons gig.
Dudes are a powerhouse haha. How old is this band? 11 mil views in 5 days. Absolutely dumping on the game. Keep it up boys. You appeal to the masses, but also still tickle the minds of more intellectual people. Incredible balance, as always. Catchy hooks, insane riffs, solos, and the same hesitant, untrusting disposition. The only other band I can think of in a similar position is The Strokes. I love both bands, for different reasons, but each band has a crazy talent for making me reminisce while listening to something I’ve never heard before. They keep the nostalgia, but push forward and break boundaries for mainstream music.
Very Very Good !!! With John Frusciante !
melhor música do ano
John Frusciante is the spirit of RHCP.
Catchy as f*ck!!!! RHCP forever 🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh f... feels like I'm young again somehow. My hometown will definitely hear this song through out of my car!
Fuck yeah! 🤟
Quiere decir que sin Frusciante no son capaces de hacer un buen álbum????? Maybe¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
Give me a break! Cant watch this. Bunch of old guys trying look cool😝
que joya
Johnny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Man this band is the shit!! Hope yall stay true man, never worth selling out, from a sock you came in a sock well take you back B)
Sou fã deis de pequeno 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Frusciante is the man
como me relaja escucharlos .......son como una canción de cuna para mi !
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
100 th listen and still lights me up like a fresh cigarette
They put Keanu Reeves on guitar!
And the memories are back
What is Will Ferrel doing in the drums!?!?
Age:59yo Voice age: 18yo
Ahhhh... that was AWESOME!
🤟🏼❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Time to try something new??
Старички порадовали! Дай бог каждому в 60 лет выглядеть так же)
I love your song hump de bump
VAMO LO PEPPER PAPAAA
Yay you guys came BACK
zajebiste w choooy
Isso tá tão indescritível de tão delicinha que está essa música <3
The vocal melody is awesome! Do anyone knows who wrote it? Is it Anthony? (John is too much. I don't know wtf happened to him, the feeling is good, but the actual guiatar parts (especially leads, solo are disturbingly forced)
Que gran tema, jamás defraudan, grande Red hot chilli peppers 🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
The Hendrix influence on Frusciante is so obvious and so amazing
John Frusciante Gênio!
Are the verses supposed to be like an old Celtic or English folk song? I assume Kiedis is putting on that dialect for dramatic purposes; the accent, bit of twang and all. Guess there's something about the "dirk" side of the moon.
This song has grown on me and im exited to see what else they’ve written
Pretty underwhelmed tbh.   Also who pronounces “dark” like that? 🧐
Only Anthony could rock a mustache and a mullet.
The band is back! And with Rick Rubin this time!
Nem da pra acreditar ainda que o Jonh Frusciante voltou, foda demais , vida longa ao red hot!!!🤟🤟🤟
Con este grupo me pasa que me gustan más las canciones que no son sencillos...a ver qué trae este 🤔👍🙋, de seguro va estar bueno.
Очень похоже на Desecration Smile 2006 года...
Am i the only one who's thinking that it's an another cliché of a RHCP song ? It seems that they are not able to make a new masterpiece like Californication anymore. Kiedis always sings in the same way like he has no inspiration. I totally respect these guys for their carreer and what their songs brang to me during my youth, but now i can't feel those vibes anymore...even if i'm glad to see Frusciante again (check his solo albums, true masterpieces !)
John Frusciante welcome...we missed you so much bro 🤘
This brings me pure happiness😏😏😏😏😏
Caras cost west de Los Angeles esse música que obra prima maravilhoso 2022.🇧🇷
Coulda told me this song came out years ago and I woulda beloved it and im here for it all I hope they go on a tour soon
Oh shit, here we go again)
Gosh I needed this! Frusciante is pure magic, Kiedis' vocals....amazing!! and boy that Will Farrell sure can rock those drums!
Sounds like Anthony became Irish after the last album. :)
Yawn. Sounds like an outake from 10 years ago.
I’m glad Will Ferrel is doing well .
Absolutely fantastic they are soon,safe to say they definitely have their own sound and it’s so good that has stayed intact over the years.
The song is about John.
Welcome Home, John.
Is it just me or is Anthony starting to look like Danny Trejo?
500k likes in 5 days 🙏
dios despues de tantos años, esto es simplemente arte en todo su esplendor
For how long is he gonna wear that stupid mustache? First you think it’s a joke but now it’s been a couple years and he just looks like an idiot with that thing in his face what is wrong Anthony?
RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS NEVER DISAPPOINT US!!!
Juste magnifique !!!
CRYING OF JOY ... THANK YOU JOHN <3
ok
John Foooo I love you
I love the song, it feels like so many people our age love our nature so much more, almost as if something cosmic has showered us with a clearer vision ❤️
John!🙌🏻 John!🙌🏻 John!🙌🏻 John!🙌🏻 John!🙌🏻 John! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
John!!!!
Frusciante
A black summer is spiritual. Its a summer which is unusual to life and people. The effects are seen but the actions of a spiritual person go unnoticed. Spirituality is an endless love and is something that generates a popular theme which is excessive to those who want good in their lives.
Sello Frusciante🎸
👉♥️
Amazing! Love Frusciante's   touch. They're definitely back
ARGENTINA WHEN?????
Магия,химия,фантастика все в одном  флаконе!
Uhuull red hot movimentando o mundo denovo
They written so much unique shit, they left with nothing but shit songs to make...  The music video is fun tho
Yes!
Зачем? Есть же Калифорникейшн. Расслабьтесь уже.
Lol, what a shitty band. What accent is he singing with?
Es genial verlos de vuelta :')
Can not wait for the album.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ See you in June!
I never know Will Ferrell is their drummer. Wtf. Damn cool.
Wow, wasn't expecting this. What a pleasant surprise. Would love to see them live soon!
Fodástico !!!!!
🤩
Oh John, you are back ? Stay a while my friend.
Emocionante retorno!! John Frusciante está de volta, e senti o Chad mais harmônico com ele. Ainda quero ver uma música com aquela junção perfeita de John com o Flea. Esperando ansiosamente pelo álbum completo. 🤘🤘❤❤
Psicodelismo! Uma viagem sonora!
Good to see Will Ferrel behind the drums again, my man is holding on
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Solita minestra da vent’anni !
Kinda a Californication part 2 vibe. Especially with the drum sound. Love the lyrics and overall vibe
Ya era tiempo que regrese Jhon Frusciante lo máximo
This song very suprising me. I really like it! :-)
Y'all can do better.. what is this..🤔
Note to people on Tik Tok: This is actual talent.
Cannot believe Will Ferrell is on the drums !!!
Now that you're back please create a hot sause  ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE !!!
♟
This is a good song it has brought me back , especially with the return of John and I would like to say to the director next time you film the peppers , focus your camera man to the hands and the guitar of John not only is he showing his ability with the guitar but showing us the feel of a real guitar player who actually like a yo make music the band it’s great don’t get me wrong
I hear it when I wake up, I'm singing it when I go to sleep. *I even do the accent*
Ohhh I was remembering a lot of things, only to see them gathering again
Ok but what's with the Sinead O'Connor/Bono accent😔
los red hot nunca decepcionan, es como un oasis en medio de tanta mierda musical que hay hoy en dia, muy bueno el regreso de john, pero la voz de antony esta mejor que nunca.
💀
I get happy every time I see that beat up Strat
Ya van cinco días y yo aún no supero la emoción ❤️
Questi sono i veri RHCP! Frusciante..❤
omg This has some nice older By The Way vibes!
White boy summer and black summer in one. We comin together ❤ 🤣
Amo
Great for a return. Once again I will listen
😭❤️
Only here for Will Ferrell 🥁
Yes what the world needs right now.. Some Good Rock And Roll
This is awful
Lenin sticker on the bass guitar?!
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al Olimpo
Nice haircut Anthony did John tie you down and put a pudding bowl over your head
Frusciante using a Leslie! Noice! Chilli's are back! :)
Me encanta que aún sigan conservando su esencia.
Frusciante.
Mi heart.
Es mi grupo favorito en el mundo, es imposible dejar de escuchar RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, espero que vengan a México! LARGA VIDA A LOS RED HOT❤️🌶️
Que grosos ....🤘🖤
excelente teme, unos de mis grupos preferidos, con este tema demuestran que no han perdido la esencia y que sigeun siendo uno de las mejores bandas
Min 2,50 mixed like a shit.frusciante i love you !
In love
Oh man, sind wir alle alt geworden!!!! Anthony sieht aber immer noch fit aus, Flea ebenfalls, aber der Schnurri von Anthony müsste ab!! Sieht Scheiße aus. Ansonsten, geiler Song!!! RHCP eben.
Jhon is back! Come back to Rock in Rio 22
Best band in 80s, best band in 2022.
This is way to good! I really am glad to see Frusciante is back, he's my inspiration afterall. Welcome home dude🤘✌️👍
John is back and everything is different.
os quiero 💗
Молодцы!
The kings are still alive🤘🤘🤘💥🔥🔥
Looks like failed CHUCK NORRIS🤔
Parece uma música B do Californication, mas é uma ótima música de retorno na melhor formação que eu conheço do RHCP, tudo que vier deles vai ser bom, porque eu gosto.
,.,.
Will Ferrell is back.
red hot voltando as origens <3
Amoooo💓💓💓💓💓
LENDAS!
When you get to their level anything you do feels both old and new in the same time.
This is literally such an amazing song. So glad that John is back with the peppers ❤️
Loveit
Anthony is literally alergic to any shirts or T-shirts :))))
Will Ferrell doing his thing!
Eh
JOHNNYYYYYYYY !!!
My soul band since ever I remember! You got me through elementary school, high school and university :) Absolute banger!
I'm getting the album on day 1
did not know that Jon Bernthal is now the vocalist of RHCP
Really amazing piece 👽
Arthur Shelby after his retirement
No words can do this track justice, shear brillance
retour des piments rouges, avec un Frusciante qui nous livre un solo plus q'émérite, ça donne un morçeau qui reste trés cool, bravo !!!
this shit sounds half done honestly.  that first transition into the chorus was like,., ok , i guess were doin this now.  literally n build up to it, its almost like 2 different songs in the way they done it.. not really, but they might as well be with how this was written.
this is the music we need!!!
yheahhhhh, red hot are back!!!!
Good song love ya
I can't believe they're back 🥲

Will Ferrell killing the drums
Que musiquinha ruim.....nuuuu
gay song
Чёрт побери,перцы продолжают качать!
Yesss...The real RHCP is back, feels like crying to hear the first intro, I knew it's you...!!! Love to see John Frusciante back on track, miss you so much guys...Love you all.
Love the song. Anthony having some trouble pronouncing very basic words though. :)
This song sounds like a song from another band but I can't seem to put my finger on it. It's been driving me nuts.
red hot is back
✨👑✨
John always has the sickest sound tuned to his axe.
🖤☀️
I am loving the "Slash" guitar sound!
🤮 Been on repeat for a day. Trying, but just can't.
I was expecting more, I miss the outrageous experimental rhcp of earlier times. I guess we all get older and it’s easier to follow the same pattern.
Yeeeeeahhh estan de regreso los red hot chili peppers 🖤🖤😍😎
In love with the first 10 seconds 😍
Welcome back 💪✔️
It's like listening to a RHCP Cover band 🤘❤️‍🔥🤘
After two catastrophic albums in terms of sound, this was welcome. hint of jimi hendrix at the beginning is lovely.  A new tasty red-hot song with GOOD sound. And a very tough solo guitar sound to.  Nice
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 RHCP
666 sign in the first 3 seconds, shame you sold yr soul Anthony, how's that working out for you? Sad so get sad!
Rojo Ardiente 🇨🇱 Picante Gracias por volver
Awesome.  Always made cool videos
🇹🇭🇹🇭
Genial simplemente alucinante
Never been a massive fan of RHCP but damn this song is fire! If the rest of the album is on this level it will be a 10/10 banger.
This group really is nothing without Frusciante tying them altogether.  That's not to say that Kiedis, Chad and Flea aren't fantastic musicians, but without John, they just sound so hollow.
Anthony got that Joe Exotic haircut!!!
What is with the porn stash and terrible haircut? Why is he trying to make himself look ugly? The song is good though, as always.
I just love it when Will Ferrel play drums for them

John F definitely brings the energy. He and the band have unmistakable chemistry.

Ufff eso hacia falta gracias red hot chili peppers con otro buen temazo !!!!!!😎🔥
Beautiful! ❤
Keren, tetap energik, RHCP 👍🏻👍🏻
Yawn yawn .
wow flea without mask in face !!!!
"China's on the dark side on the moon"... That's some deep lyrics right there
Clip created with Unreal engine?
Thank God for Chad Smith!  His stuff is right on!!  The rest......meh
Will Ferrell still kicks ass on drums j/king lol great band always has been
РХЧП навсегда!👍👍👍
Ah enfin quelque chose à se mettre sous la dent! Bien!
If only this came out when Zoolander came out 🤟🏽💜🎶
these guys still give me chills after 30+ years
Los red hot es su puro estado y esencia jamás perdieron su estilo musical y ese ritmo en sus canciones únicos que sólo ellos saben crear. The red hot is their pure state and essence, they never lost their musical style and that rhythm in their unique songs that only they know how to create.
Mi banda de rock favorita 🙏
RHCP telah menjadi bagian dari hidup saya sejak remaja..terima kasih buat semua nya,kalian luar biasa..teruslah berbagi energi buat kami penggemar mu. Salam dari Indonesia 🇮🇩👏🤙
FLEA DIOS DEL BAJO 🔥
Is it just me or does the guitar solo have a Pink Floyd-ish vibe?   Like the guitat tone reminiscent of the solo in Time from Dark Side of the Moon?
They are all crazy but it's simply in a good way ^^
Now we need a Musical Drama Biopic film about the band called “Californication”. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Who should direct the movie and play the band members?
obviously political statement, think, yo
#17 PY
RHCP!!! 🙌🙌🙌 Mr. Kiedis gave me his autograph at a Laker game once. Super humble man. Never forget it!
Фрушанте топ, хорошо что он всегда возвращается
Long Live The King. RHCP!
Трек хорош, клип полное говно.
Frusciante is back!
AHHHHHHHHH
This song is freaking me out. My father passed away on the upload date of this video. "Cremation takes a piece of your supply..." Is haunting because we are getting him Cremated and we are struggling for the funds for the funeral.
Nunca pirde su esencia RHCP!!!!!
New Age of Gold
That´s the sound. Whao. RHCP are back...
This is giving me butterflies!!!!! So grateful for RHCP comeback. It came as a surprise to me, such a special one; thrir sound filling me with this fire of feeling alive, it's hard to describe. It's nostalgia brought to the now.
Meh…
Frusciante.....!!
Goosebumps......
The Guitar in this Song can touch your Soul🤘 John Frusciante is a GENIUS!!!
They get better with every new album!
simple but very nice bass line. different chord progression. welcome back John. incredible Anthony's fitness. Chad's drumming is always a fortress.
I'm in love with the solo and the beat everything is sooo perfect! Exactly what I'd imagine for a rhcp Song. And at 2:50 is such a nice and impressive come back it fits perfectly
It feels so short, need to repeat.
Великолепно!
El bajo de Flea es lo mejor de lo mejor ♡
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
All hail the return of John Frusciante. This instantly sounds like classic RHCP. Love it!
Young kids into edm and rap hating on this song.. 20 years later will have a mustache and mullet
Didn't see a comment about it, but are we all just ignoring that new accent AK has picked up? Badass to have Frusciante back. Can't wait to hear the full album.
Better than some of their earlier songs
Love you Guys are back 2gether <3
Great to see Will Ferrell back on the drums
Welcome back, guys! This song keeps getting better and better every time I hear it.
The Red Hot's are  The Devine Angel's. 2022 can't be that bad, RHCP release is like hitting the lotto.
What's with the mullet and mustache? Is Keidis trying to look like Gunther, the dude who did the "You touch my tra la la" song?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmlXqz1SK4g
John is Back .This is Chilling 🌶️
He really looks like Skinny from Breaking Bad.
Vamoooo Los Peppperssss!!
Yay new RHCP . Do yall like Surfbort ?
even though I don't like the music. I enjoyed the band's return, long live the group.
Red shit holy peppers? Never heard about it😄
RHCP YEAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
John is John, never disappoint.
Red Hot Chilli Peppers making Red Hot Chilli Peppers with the sound of Red Hot Chilli Peppers. In 2022. Crazy
how is that different to 99% of their songs? Copy & paste....
Obrigado por existir na mesma era que esses caras
Catchiest dang pirate jaunty I’ve ever heard.
@1:14 wait was that a nod to greta thunberg?
Is John Frusciante? When did he return to the band? Im lost :/
love it
This sounds how Californication should have sounded
Great tune! Been a long time coming! Thank you RHCP!
RHCP hit different when Frusciante is manning the guitar. Like it or not its a fact.
John thought he was slick trying to get by with that solo and thinking I wasn’t going to rewind it continuously
I love this so much. Perfect timing for this single too. Like Phoenix from the Ashes. Josh was great but this is the Chili Peppers I grew up with.
more of the same... rip rhcp
Guitarist: Keanu Reeves Drums: Will Ferrell
Oh shit I didn't know that Tiger King made new music this song is fuego 🤣🤣
I've been waiting for this since I heard John was rejoining the RHCP. It doesn't disappoint!! Thank you so much!
Already daydreaming of the sound of John Fruciantes guitar at Broncos stadium this summer!!!  Just got tickets
Perfect!🥰 Send more...🎸🎧♥️😍🤘
King is back
Wow... What a nice surprise
О Боже, мы дождались!
38 yrs plus and strong … let’s give them 38m views in 38 days …Curious case of RHCp !
Also one of my Dogs is even names Flea!  🤟💚💛❤️
LEGENDARY
We need the Chili Peppers right now... Just the fact that they never change, in a good way, and they have been doing it for all these years at the top almost makes you tear up.. the years continue to fly by but some things are as steady as the wind. Always there. Red hot Chili Peppers vibe is always strong and hits just right. Thank you guys for all these years of the very best..✌🖤🤘
There is Nothing in this World that Makes me Feel the Way that The RHCPS  makes me feel!  They have been the constant in my life since I was a Little girl and I am going to be 37!  Their Music feeds my Heart and Soul!  Also,  Thank Goodness John is Back!  The Sound is Complete! 💚❤️💛
Me choca que eles estão em #19 no em alta aqui do Brasil, tipo, uma fucking banda de rock no em alta entre as 20 músicas mais escutadas AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Respect.
love u guys
I was 13 when I started listening to Rhcp. Now I'm 36. RHCP  1999 fOREver! :)
The best news in music for 10 years: the return of John Frusciante! Can't wait to go see them in Paris in July, for my very first time! Stay true
Que surreal ouvir esse som!!  Os caras conseguem manter essa mesma vibe de 40 anos atrás!  Melhor banda do mundo! 🤘🏻🤪
los estoy queriendo
Brasil 2022 🇧🇷
Only Anthony can pull off a looks like this
RHCP is the reason that rock still alive…
I thought YouTube was recommending a 12year old song, but this is only 5 days old 😌🎶😍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Well sorry posers… but this is crap
Wow, wow wow: i have no words for it. i am 61 and still  get excited over new songs
They said Anthony Kiedis raped a 14 year old minor. How disgusting sexual predator . Plus he now looks super ugly with that mustache and hair. He is not cute anymore.
Bienvenidos de nuevo a los 4 Excelente temazo! Felicidades.
It is a pure pleasure to listen this song!
Como en los viejos tiempos!
SHOW NO BRASIL POR FAVOR
wh..what?
Eu amo demais vocês❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
...NOTHING SPECIAL HERE.
La mejor banda del mundo. La perfección hecha sonido acompañandote en cualquier momento de la vida.
Anthony with the rapist mustache 🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waiting on another black Summer to end. Man, aren't we all. Excellent song.
Good to have ya back frusciante
i love you so much guys
Manoo, os caras mesmo depois de tanto tempo conseguem manter a essencia da banda.. PQP!!!
This is a monumental come back. We needed it in 2022.
Frusciante's sound gives me chills
this is incredible, I couldn’t be happier! they’re baaaack 🌶🌶🌶
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Больше бы драйва и динамики....(
is that will farell on the drums? where's the cowbell?
Never dies... Forever RHCP
С возвращением RHCP 10 лет ждали🔥🎸💪😆
Red Hot being Red Hot. Amazing 🔥
Una vez mas Red Hot Chili Peppers lo hizo jajajajaja, tremendo tema cabros 🤘🏻
Incrível como pode passar como for o tempo, as músicas deles sempre tem o mesmo estilo e dá aquela nostalgia de quando eu era criança e ouvia eles ❤️
RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS ARE BACK CARALHO
RHCP ❤
As a huge RHCP fan I sadly have to say they should just retire. They don't bring anything new to the table and at this point their songs all sound the same, they should've retire on top instead of becoming a shadow of their former selves like U2.
I don't have anything against the Josh , both albums with him were great - but the sound of  John's guitar is one and only.
You can hEAr that Flea and John are back together and loving it
Annoying songs like last 15 years, the mood is gone.
Anthony looks like Gunther ehehe 😁😁
PORQUE NO SE PUEDE UN MILLON DE LIKES 🥺🥺
They are aging well. Kids at heart, solid love circle man o man!!!!!
Will Ferrell on the drums, Dave Ghrol on the guitar, Steve-O on the bass, you can never go wrong, there.
This song is both fresh and familiar, masters at work
Red Hot Chili Peppers: thanks for posting. Another great song. Here's to you guys coming back to Philly September 3rd. Cheers!
👏👏👏👏👏 🇧🇷🤘
So cool to see they let Will Ferrell do their drumming!       *sarcasm*
EU AMO
Back to stadium arcadium sound!!!!! 🤟
This song is better and better, that's crazy! I am singing the song the whole day
Welcome back! like an injection in the arm after a dead couple of years of music.
Que ? Como assim música nova 😳❤️😍
Did my man just hit the zyzz pose at 2:48??
Terus Berkarya 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Ugh sea shanties were so 2020. I'm on Nick Cave's side over this track.
The guitar ... thank you <3
мда, то чувство , когда узнал джона по началу песни, а потом уже увидел его в клипе
this song is terrible. Anthony, what's up with the weird accent. cant wait to hear it on Los Angeles "rock" stations for the next 20 years.
IT IS JON! HELL YEAH! Frusciante is a genius man
Mind-blowing how these guys have been able to keep true to their sound all these years AND remain incredibly relevant. Awesome to have Frusciante back in the mix!! 🙏
Rip Blackie Dammet. 🙏 I know Kiedes is refering to his pops in this song. Hed be proud.
Oh my gosh my high school soul'sturn back with John , this is the amazing news on 2022 , still young, still Rock.
VAMOS!!! 💪💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!!
Sin duda son lo mejor de lo mejor "RHCP" ... ❤️❤️❤️ ...
Anthony is 59 wtf
Back to the old chillies. Josh was decent but he was never John, the man is a genius. And Rick Rubin os one of the best producers of all time
RHCP aren't RHCP without that ever jamming guitar.  Josh was fine at playing, but he really lacked John's incredible talent at writing.  So wonderful to have him back - let's hope this new album is half what Stadium Arcadium was!
11M in 5 days. Spreading like C19.
and chinas on the dark side of the moon..
Back to their best
Will Ferrell on drums!
Still amazing 🔥
It's the same guitar! (Anthony bought this guitar for John in 1998 or 1999, when he came back)
It's fine, not great but fine.
EL 2022 EMPEZÓ AHORA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Los Rolling Stones de nuestra época :')
A guitar solo these days 😬😲😁
11mln ❤🌶
That haircut lol
Coisa linda
Not gonna lie, kinda miss the funky vibes from your other boy on guitar
Les RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS sont de retour, quelle jolie ballade, j adore
Incríveis como sempre 🔥a essência deles é inigualável
Man will is banging the crap out of those drums
Same ol chili 🌶️. Loving this
Resting hard on their laurels.
¡Qué belleza por Dios! Se me eriza la piel cada vez que vuelvo a escuchar Black Summer. Esta será mi canción del año; esa vibra que trasmiten me hace sentir que estoy más viva que nunca. Son artesanos de la música RHCP🌶 ¡estoy feliz por poder disfrutarlos en esta etapa de mi vida y más ahora que están juntos los 4 otra vez!
John Frusciante stopped ageing
super kawałek, nie mogę się doczekać całego albumu
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷❤️❤️❤️👍📻🎶🎶🎶
Keanu revees
👊🏻💥👊🏻😎
I didn’t know how much I needed new RHCP
I've had The Wind Cries Mary stuck in my head all week thanks to John's little fill at 0:50
Es lo mejor del año, volvio la musica bien. algo de verdad. Rock Compitiendo con regueton ! Ya los sacamos de los CHARTSSS
Just think at this AGE also Anthony can still walk around shirtless 🤭💥💥💥💥 Ohhhhhh!!!!! I REALLY needs his body.......
Took me 5 days to find my way here and from the start of John Frusciante's strumming, it just grips your soul. It takes you back to an old nostalgic feeling and then makes you happy that it's new too. So much has changed in our worlds, yet, RHCP remains RHCP. Hats off! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So fricking good! Respect to the boys!
Young guns 2 vibes plus im getting the indian navaho references in the first 2 verses. Were almost there folks. California fell just as they talked about.
Couldn't be anyone cgi if it tried Anthony Kleidis ain't here...remember he was the Epstein flight list 😣don't even sound like him sounds like some paddy trying to sound like him😂🤣
How great would it be if Deborah Chow directed this on The Volume (à la the Mandalorian). Such a cool video for a super cool band. Love it.
Oh YESS OH HEELLL YESSSSSS!!! RHCP!!! <3 <3
únicos únicos! los mejores del mundo! 🙇‍♂️ los putos amossss..  * RHCP  🇵🇪
Like this if you’re here from 2055
The beginning of this made it seem like a song from the cobra kai soundtrack lmaoo
Their best song in awhile wow. John makes such a difference. So impressive that they can still write a great song after all these years.
Tendencia en Ecuador, me alegra que en mi país disfruten de esta joyita...

THIS is real good music
Esses 4 caras são fodas demais. Um som com as pegadas do "Stadium Arcadium"  Muito bom!
Keidis was on Epstein’s flight logs
The first notes of the guitar I knew it was John playing, unmistakable greatness on all their parts. May the Red chili Peppers never die and may they always be hot.
Wow 👀🔥
Who's that new guy?
Welcome back John... 👍🏾
RHCP amazing as always. Love from Brasil 🙌❤👏👏
Great vibe and great song
He really sang" I've been waiting , I've  been waiting" and then  I scream into the phone " I THINK WE All HAVE!!!" gah my throat hurts from screaming, but I don't mind cause it's the only indication that I'm not dreaming.
OMG I'm crying... love this!
I love this return to the real red hot chilli peppers this album is going to be so good so happy to see John back!!!
It's like a friend I haven't seen in a long time and we picked up right where we left off.
how is the dude so jacked
Although the meaning is heavy, this song sounds light and positive... reminds me of knock me down, soul to squeeze, my lovely man...
10 million views in 5 days that's epic 🤘
I know that this is a new song, but did this take anyone else back to the 90s? It already feels like it has been around for decades.
great song !!
Ohhh yeah that's that Frusciante spice that's been missing so glad he's back!
Frusciante 💚
I saw Keanu Reeves playing guitar in this video
I appreciate the fact of not making use of „californication“ 🌶
Aguante RHCP 🤘
😜 Pornstash and a mullet! Awesome song! Great job being yourselves.
ROCK OUT!!! MOTHERFUCKERS!!! 🌶🌶🤘🏻
its nice to hear john vocal on the background, and ofc his tasty riff again.
Россия говорит "СПАСИБО"
Awesome! Very good vibes! Californiaaaaaaa dreamsss
Somos pocos pero suficientes...
Meeeeeu Deus, a hora que essa batera entra , obrigado por isto, INCRIVEL ✌🏻🤧😎🙌🏻💥🦖🔥
Rhcp is back !!
awfull
this is it.
Bom demais, Very good
Long Live Belarus! ⚪️🔴⚪️
Te quiero mucho Red Hot Chilli Peppers
Hace más de 1 semana que está en tendencias. Es bueno encontrar algo de música de calidad entre tanta mierda
Наконец-то солист похож на ПТУ-шника из 90-х.Красаво!

LYRICS: A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
0:46 1st scene of John Frusciante gave me goosebumps :)
What’s up with the way he sings dark? Lol. Deeeurk side of daa moon.
I don’t think The Getaway deserves any hate whatsoever, tbh one of my fav albums by them. However having John back hits different. The dude is a modern day Hendrix. His tone in this song is exceptional. Stoked for the rest of the album.
It's Aqualung by Jethro Tull, haha.
This reminds me of finding new tracks on stadium Arcadium, such a treat to have the all stars back:)
love it, so unbelievable ther still together and john is back - love ther are still making so cool music -  looking so good , feels so good , its a delight =)
Will Ferrell has aged like a fine wine
A public service announcement ******* "DONT STOP MAKING MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!" ******* thank you. 😊
Hall and Oats are BACK! finally!!!
RHCP IS FCKING BACK
nashe
The drumbeat sounds like Californication
Holy shit this is great
I see the same guys and hear the same music. Very nice!
para ficar melhor ainda, pelo menos para mim, é Linkin Park é anunciar que irão voltar. Aí seria foda demais.
musica fantástica
Música boa, como sempre 👍
Вот уже 20 лет все песни на один мотив  под одну гребенку... надоело
anthony is turning into the cab driver of the by the way video
Living legends again
They're back! And as someone said: 'they've kept their essence'. You gotta appreciate and respect that. I realize Frusciante is almost as important to the band as Kiedis is. Phenomenal guitarist with his play style integrity. Great intro and guitar tracks, other than that it doesn't sound like a hit to me. But I respect that they're not trying to do another Dani California/By the way/Californication hit, but makes music from the place were they are right now.
Holy fuck my love for John is indescribable. The man is a fucking genius on the strings
L O V E   Y O U   G U Y S  !!
volvieron saludos desde COSTA RICA
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👍🇰🇿
Wow
Red hot Perfeito!!🎶🔊🇧🇷🇧🇷 BRASIL
The first time I listened I honestly said to myself why have they gone down this path like every other band, but then I kept listening and realised everyone evolves. Love the drumming on this track it’s so on point.
Wow 10m views just in 5 days 🔥
Caralho! 🔥👏
Kwai Chang Caine meets Frank Zappa? Is that the look Kiedis is going for? :) Good tune - nice to hear RHCP back!
RHCP still HOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I get some stadium arcadium album vibes so glad they’re all back together
There'll be plenty more trends coming and going, but nothing comes close to their sound and energy.
Amazing. Wonderfull
Its not a rhcp’s song unless I see Will Ferrell on the drums
there are 10000 better hairstyles
Somebody pinch me
😍😍😍 Comeback 🔥🔥🔥
OMG Fruciante!
Hit me now!
Como pode vei, qualquer musica dessa banda me pega
<3
weak song
GOEDZO RHCP
Love it❣

I miss red hot chili pepper 😢 this is amazing 😍
Lo mejor de lo mejor red
Hey IS that their New song and John fusciante back waowww,w same man
Musica para siempre
Thank you for making a great music. Thank you❤❤❤❤
Better 😌
John's back?! This is amazing news... I liked Josh a lot but John is a true RHCP
this song is weak
you can tell they've changed by their looks but they still sound as incredible as they used to
2:57 its too funny when Anthony hurls the mic stand away and then 3 seconds later its back, only lightly disturbed
Los Extrañaba! Gracias por tanta música 🥺🥰🥰🥰
Wowww so cool👌
Qué bueno que RHCP sigan activos. Qué el rock no muera. Vamos sigan así. Saludos desde Argentina.
Somebody should make a 24-hour loop of the solo! Love it!
The guitar sound says it all!!!!
K nostalgia ùnú los tkm ♡
This shits awful. And i love RHCP..
레전드
they r such legends
❤❤❤❤
Keep rocking!!
Gracias
Mis amores, me acompañan desde mi niñez, mi adolescencia, adulta y como madre.  Quiero que vuelvan  con muchos recitales en la Argentina
Omg it's red hot chilli peppers . The most overrated band of all time .

Definitivamente se siente la reincorporación de John Frusciante.
I could hardly get into rock bands but RHCP was different, every song I click on I add to my playlist. They're just just good.
Siempre serán mi eterno suspiro...❤️❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely fucking beautiful. Wow
Brazil 🇧🇷🔥✨🤙
Hoy RHCP me hizo sonreír ♥️
So amazing they are comeback 😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
00:47......and the legenda is finally back!
Excelente!!!!
Good to hear John slide in those solos again.
John Legend !
Mr.John is back with style,excellent🤙🤙🤙🤙
oh yeah they are complete again. more please !!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Thank the LORD for more Peppers!
it ia so rare that songs have a guiyar solo these days...what an absolute pleasure it was to listen to guitar solo after so long !
That frusciante riff... wow its been a while since stadium arcadium album
Are we fcking old or what?
What the fuck is that mustache...
For not repeating so much with the moustache, a good look for Anthony along this new album with their respectives clips or singles, would have been to wear beard instead of moustache that has been wearing over 10 years.
Welcomeback, John..
タカエロo~　 シロイロo～ ハ～イくぅ~🎾🚶‍♀️🐩  あっふ- はぁ 暖ったかぁ~👁️♾️👁️
THE RETURN OF JOHN FRUSCIANTE AND RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
RHCP is like wine, the older it is, the better it is.
:44 second mark = Goosebumps and tears. If you know, you know. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ "Unlimited Love"
Пацаны, охуенно!! Живее всех живых!!
うーん、、まぁまぁかな
Will Ferrell rocking the drums
musica muito chata e depressiva.   estou lendo diversos comentários que a banda voltou as origens, mas isso so faz sentido se for considerar do álbum Californication pra frente , e esquecer os seis, eu disse seis , 6 , albums que a banda lançou anteriormente, e ai sim enterrar a verdadeira origem deles  que era influenciada por hard-rock funk e psicodélicos , algo que eles nunca mais fizeram em 20 anos  então pra quem diz que eles voltaram a origem, com certeza não conhece o que realmente foi essa banda
The shot at 0:53 blew me away. Under the bridge was my first big song I ever felt so much drive and passion to learn when I first started playing. I’ll always associate that shot of John in the music video with all my first memories of learning how to play
Frusciante, the absolute beastttt
Although new, it’s still a beautiful yet nostalgic feeling. It’s iconic RHCP.
Anthony puttin out strong 🐅 👑 vibes
Welcome back John. God bless you.
Cant wait for the tour with John 😍😍😍
Un sorriso e per un attimo ritorni  a fine anni '90,grazie
Yo this song trash
It's good to see John back with them where he belongs..his playing is amazing. Cool tune, I like it..
rhcp never disapoints
Regards from Indonesia!
A Zombie apocalypse is coming. But instead of people getting revive, It's the band and music of 2000s making their comeback.
2022 just got better
Muito chato, é exatamente oq eu esperava, nada de surpreendente para comover meu coração R.I.P RHCP
Goosebumps bro Goosebumps
How many other guys got bodyshamed into working out by Anthony’s major flexing 💪🏾
Holy shit! John's back!
Jhon is back again and again....
Happy Mondays called......... asking for their dance back.
Meh
derk syde of tha moon
Will Ferrel is back baby /s
Yes!  The chili peppers are back and better than ever
So nice to see Will Ferrel' still got that drum beat.
Нихуя себе 😁
Honestly I think that Josh should stay in the band at this point. RHCP era with John was the greatest, but previous 2 albums with Josh were quite good (not as good as Californication or By The Way for instance, but still quite good). They evolved to something new recently and Josh fitted well in the concept...
ㅠㅠ 추억 돋는다.
Se o clipe fosse todo no estilo da última cena acho que seria muito mais foda
RHCP I ❤ U FULL, remain a favorite band since young until now "still the best"
yeah me gusta
Frusciante 👌Flea 👌 love the skills of these guys
YEEEEES.....PEPPERS ARE BAAACK!!!!!!!!!
Sadly, this song would have easily fit onto Stadium Arcadium. That is a problem.
Legend never die.......
His mustache is getting seriously powerful
Is it me or is Jhon Frusciante destined for the Red Hot and vice versa... Of course he came back and a legendary song to start with
Será que é cedo pra sonhar com um show no Brasil em 2022?
Terrible. They are so lame now, so formulaic. They used to be great, in BSSM days. Then they were very good, with One Hot Minute and By The Way (Californication is ok but overrated). The double album would have made one great album. Everything since is a shadow of the band they once were.  When John wanted to go more punk and Flea wanted to go more techno, they should have at least tried something different. Instead they listened to Rick Rubin and just continued to push out the pop stuff we get now. Disappointing. They used to be innovative.
I swear this band always brings good vibes to my heart <3
We love you, John. Welcome back!
Pra quem já fez um vídeo como "Californication" esse clipe parece feito por um estagiário. Mas é a música que importa.
will ferrell on drums.       -sorry, i hadnt seen these guys in awhile. it was shocking.
This sounds like daisy domergue's song from The Hateful Eight
Awesome track, got to ask though, has Flea been watching Bez ( The maracas playing dancer from Happy Mondays ? )
ya estan viejos :( ♥
Ya baby! The Chili Peppers are still Red Hot!
All of them look the same since old days lol
Will Ferrell is really good at drums
Great song....it's like it's right off of the Californication  or Stadium Arcadium LP.'s......I get "This Velvet Glove" and "Desecration Smile" vibes.....
Welcome back
Its been close to 30 years since under the bridge I'm 43 and this might be my favorite red hot chili peppers song!! Love it!!!!
yesssssss
やっぱジョンのギターソロは沁みる…
It sounds like an old demo that they just finally released.  Not sure what's with the accent though when he sings.
FIREEE💥💥💥🤘💣💣💣💣💣
my dude is almost 60, and is jacked.
🔥🔥🤘🤘🎧🎧
This is bad
Never heard an RHCP tune I didn’t like.
Still got it, timeless!
yeeeee s!!!! fck'n Cooolll( ；；)
Fk! I love these guys, they keep getting better...all of their most recent sht is addictive, don't think I've ever had any other artists on repeat like them
I've always loved rhcp, but my favorite part is how much more enthusiastic Chad gets with every new video.
I'm getting second hand embarrassment from this song....
🌞🙏🍀
They can't fuck up writing new music.  They have a significant sound that can't be duplicated. Love it!!!!
Generic af
I expected a song with more originality, this feels like a redo of old RHCP songs between 2003-2006. Hate to admit it, but yeah. Still love that John's back though!
Nice song
What's amazing is that he has a mullet in 2022
Thank you ❤️
Didn't know Will Ferrell can play drums
I honestly dont want them to retire
:-( bad  ...no red.
Is this guy inmortal or what? 60 yo and looks the same
*Es un tema nuevo??!!*
After the initial, very peculiar disappointed feeling of getting EXACTLY what you wanted but it not feeling as you expected it to be, you'll start to enjoy it more and more as you realize that the band's continuity resembles your own.  This black summer will end sooner rather than later, and nothing will be lost.
Will Ferrell on drums
Why this song so nostalgic in many way, it's feel like I'm back to 2000 were I'm happy to hear RHCP
Anthony looks like that 1 uncle you have, but you can only visit with other adults in the room
One thing missing from this song is the iconic classic strum of the bass guitar that is played in most every song these guys have made.  Just slightly different than im used to hearing but never the less still always good.  Thank you RHCP
surreal
Rhcp never dissapoint! Sending love from Philippines
Welcome back John!
Sooo good !! 🔥 black Summer ❤ guitar 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸❤
Just what we needed. A new RHCP song.😍😍😍
Hell yeahhh boys =D
HAPPY TO HEAR YOU AGAIN RHCP . WELCOME BACK JOHN ! :-)
Seeing Will Ferrell on the drums brings joy to my eyes
this shit is beautiful.
Glorioso!
Sound like Californication (single).
Anthony looking like Graham Nash.
Love from malaysia🇲🇾❤🌶🌶
0:51 Hendrix lives on in those two chords
banger!
Californication 2.0
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk o frusciante certamente faz toda a diferença.
Unici...John the best player
1) RHCP are BACK 2) JOHN FRUSCIANTE is BACK 3) RHCP are on the BEST FORMATION 4) THE GREAT SONG 5) THE BEST WAY TO AWARE THE WORLD that WE DESERVE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN THIS WORLD 6) TOO MANY SUNS ARE NOT BETTER IF THEY HAD NO LOVE 7) GREAT SONG,  GREAT MASTERPEACE,  THOSE ARE THE SIGNATURE RHCP
saw them in a small venue/bar right before Mother's Milk and a few years later, headlining Lollapalooza.  both were great shows.  i saw them again in the mid-00s and it was not very good.  there is something with bands like RHCP where youth is fairly important.  they had that rebel feel that is hard to emulate when over 30 or 40.
Fr a banger
Can’t believe that i am hearing them for a new track RHCP  Bringing a lot of memories 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
До слез!!!!! С возвращением!
Anthony looks like Arthur Shelby of leaky blinders 😂😅 by the way, great song
C'mon we need Rock genre back to it's peak... Young generation should inspired by these legends and forming more unique bands and sounds.
The continuos repetition of a washed up formula. Shite.
Excelente.
All the same sounding album after album.
music too weak I didn't like it. 👎👎
Finally they're back again ! Yesss!
Welcome back chilis fantastic song!
John is Back
Damn im old..
Awesome
O.M.J.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Крутая песня!!!
Its been a long time since i met a knew friend...This is a instant classic
2:37 at this moment we all question our physical fitness
Will Ferrell on drums?! Surprising but awesome!
instant hit...well done Peppers
Same energy
I’ve been out of the loop… when did John get back with the band?!?!
*me watching some tech reviews, sees this MV* Me : Red hot chi. . OH SHIT!
ナイスサウンドですね🎵クールな雰囲気が、ナイスです😃ありがとうございます❗
Oh wait what
Sounds like when the beatles discovered opiates and started listening to Ringo's suggestions. Sounds like combo of Californication and Nights in White Satine. Eerie  and troubling.
This looks like AI generated mashup of RHCP log
Welcome back, John Frusciante.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ficou parecido com a pegada do By The Way, curti.
I just felt my whole body sigh in relief. This is what I've been waiting for.
Jojo
Always was a chilli pepper fan.  But are you all serious that this is real cool? Yeah we'll see how it goes???
I appreciate John being back as much as anyone... but why is nobody talking about Anthony's new manufactured Irish accent? Where did that come from and why?
RHCP music is timeless .... another cool song
Йде по полю козак Голота... :-)
crap
Frusciante steals the show 🔥
When music has no more soul 🙁 even RHCP lost it. I've heard this song a million times on the radio
Só quem é Pepper raiz, vai se arrepiar com esse solo de John. A essência do RHCP voltou!
It was worth the wait!
RIP Yertle the Turtle! (1983-1995)
Thank you for giving our kids something to listen to. I really thought they will live on shitty music. 🙌🙌🙌
YEAHHHHHHHH dude i've been prepared for the comeback for sososo long, they'll always have that red hot kick!!
So good to see John back, awesome song!
After the last two years of isolation, lockdowns, uncertainty, and loss this is exactly what I needed. A new chilli peppers track to groove to ⚡️🌈🎧😍😎
awesome. This is why I love the R H Ch P...🥰😜
Black summer but everything is China! I need it!
John is clearly the soul of the chili's because.. I went off them when he left.
Legends after a long time❤
So good to see the peppers with John Frusciante!
That shiny smile of Fleas make me happpy
Frusciante is back fuck yeh!
This Is a masterpiece ❤️
All my 90s 2000s fav band seems like i dont like their new songs anymore alternative to rap metal to emo or maybe im still stuck on that eras.. But i like the hair and the mustache though.. 😂😂
John Frusciante is back babyyyy, mantapppsss
Great song!!
Can't wait for unlimited love album 😍
Cutscene TV already did it!
Welcome back John Fruciente....
I’m still in shock that my favourite band is back together again! Im just so happy I love you guys ❤️🖤
💛💛💛
welcome back jhon
Yawn.
Best RHCP is back! So nostalgic, thank you
As a 90s kid I don't get the same feeling of nostalgia like the majority in the comments it seems 😅.
This the old school Red Hot back!
Smile uppon my face when i hear ya ! Red Hot ARE BACK !!!!!!!
Thank you so much for this beauty !!!!!!!
Anthony Kiedis looking like he's about to hug someone by order of the fookin' Peaky Blooinders. Glad to have new RHCP music in 2022, thank you guys! <3
Thats 70s MO.... got that IGGY POP vibe in vogue. Anthony still has that awesome Peppers voice we all love! The band sounds sensational!
YEAH BABE, NOW WE ARE F***ING ROCKIN'!  The GREAT return of RHCP! 🤘😆🤘
That look reminds me of 70s porn star lol
It's a trip to see Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Jesus Christ and Smeagol play music together!
John's got the old chipped stratocaster back!! Cool!!
0/10 California not mentioned
I MISS YALL GUYSS 💀🔥
Some bands don't get killed by time. Anthony is fit. Should give Johnny Depp some tips haha. Great stuff guys. Love the choice of putting the solo so early in the song.
Finally that Frusciante-shaped hole has been filled again! So looking forward to the rest of the album!
Oh wow. I immediately loved this song after first listen. It gives me Stadium Arcadium vibes. I love it. 😁🔥🔥🔥
Al fin.
Wow RHCP is back 🔥🔥🔥
"Been a long time since I made a new friend" - This hits hard in the wake of COVID. Going out and meeting new people is something most of us haven't been able to do for 2 years now. So happy John's back with the band!
God, they are so old. Its so sad
Very cool song,greetings from poland
he looks a lot like eddie guerrero here
I think " dark necessities" ( with the bassline catchy intro) was a most poverful single, but this one sounds also very good.
CUT THE MOUSTACHES
They just dropped the summer anthem, love the vibes. Reminds me of the early 2000’s.
I won’t lie, when I first listened to this song I was quite a sceptic. I thought it wasn’t bold enough for them..  But the more I’ve listened, the more I’ve realized that this song is actually beautifully-complex. I’m excited for the rest of the album to come out!
Pron star mustache
That GUITAR, RHCP!! This slaps!  🌶🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KOLOT KALAPA ANJIR
glad to see the peppers making new music and doing their thing. That being said, don't feel this is that great of a song. But hope they keep putting some new stuff out!
Wooww thats i call music..thx you rhcp i miss my old life
I see Will Ferrell on the drums. 😅
LA PEOR CANCION QUE HE ESCUCHADO EN SUS MAS DE 20 AÑOS, UN RIFF DESORDENADO, SEMIDESAFINADO, LO PUEDO ESCUCHAR MIL VECES Y NO LO COMPRENDO, NI ME LO APRENDO. HORRIBLE, BASICA, SIN PERDON, SACADA DEL GUIÓN, REENCAUCHADA, USADA.
I love hearing frusciantes background vocals again
Me parece a música de abertura do Sunday night da Nfl
I appreciate the albums with Josh but this is already 100x better
larga vida Red hot chili peppers cada melodía es como abrir heridas de mi adolescencia la esencia sigue intacta lml🥺🥺🥺🥺
Always forget Will Ferrell is their drummer /s
Love you from age 15 yearold just now im 36 yearold from Thailand
Anthony's still repping the no t-shirt look. Love it!!!!!!
Is that Frusciante back on guitar again?? Ho Lee fook
I'm sorry that it took me 5 days to see/hear this lol. This song is awesome! I can't wait to hear more 🤘😎
Alguém mostra essa música pra banda Calcinha Preta Urgente!!!!!!
レッチリだーー💓
Those howling guitar solos
I missed John's guitar solos
Very By The Way ish , man I love RHCP
This song take me back in time Rhcp always
Lo this my new hit https://youtube.com/shorts/l8brxRAhSn0?feature=share
I am a life long (30 years) RHCP fan and can say with heavy heart I did not enjoy this song.
Song is great, but didn't you hear Somebody to love by Jefferson Airplane ?
จอห์นยังสุดยอดเหมือนเคย น้ำตาไหลเลย
😥
Man, Will Ferrell's drumming is pretty mint in this!

I don't know if john is back, good to see this guys
this shld be in cobra kai
Giving me Ireland Vibes 🇮🇪
I'm fucking love you guys.... I
It has a "under the bridge" vibe to it, i'm guessing it'll be a huge song...
Unique band that have ever put together. Looking forward to new album
Chili magic is back!
The Stadium Arcadium album giutars and vocal + Californication drum groove = Black Summer
So glad Jon is back
Nobody going to comment how ripped Anthony is?
Sunrise at noon don't assume you could be coz you won't be living driven by this fued fuelled by desire hells flames out no fire just a bird on a wire Dore straits the debates about bad good or evil these people deep a little whittle away at that timber till it's a tree branches over my head shading me is it crazy to dream when you don't sleep the mind unleashed deeper then the ocean
Anthony Kiedis still has shirt allergy, good stuff!
I will always love you guys stay safe please I need you and I need like 3 more albums cmon !
Why is he singing like that 😂😂😂😂
Flea at 1:56 :D   ...legends ❤️
<3 <3
Every time I listen to this song, I get a huge snail in my lace, not just because Jerry is back, but because you can't feel progressive, myalgiac, and crappy energy detonating from the metacarpal. It's also no sunrise cow sickly or relatably he wore no skin car fighting Bangladesh; Thyme glow eczema glue pier twat tubesock puppet candy apple Sunday Arthur Morgan tit weasel pancake barbiturate cormungo. Higg crafg plytcu svopmar.
old rock stars,,
Welcome back John... Finally 😍
Sehat2 ya kalian opa2 ku
Hell yeah! It's a present date upload, couldn't believe my eyes 😂😂😂
Man I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers so much! They have helped me in my darkest moments. They're such a unique band.
AWWWW YISSSSSS
But why did he suddenly get an Irish accent ?
Дима Билан и тут подрабатывает?
vibes…
Ok next song
what’s up with Anthony’s bootleg Irish accent?
Dirty Black Summer
Não confio e nem gosto de pessoas que não gostam de RHCP
********🤘👍🏼🤘👍🏼🤘👍🏼🤘********
welcome home, john
Группа чисто для меня как была так и осталась, группой одной песни. Остальное как то не цепляет ни как. Не моё.
10 mil views))))
The First 1/2 kinda reminds me on Under the Bridge
Diego Verdaguer reborn
we invite you to Poland ❤
Axırki klassik RHCP stilində bir mahnı ❤️❤️❤️
Woww i enter to  the channel and there is a new  musix video.
Great to see you guys again, I like the song! 👍🤘 Hello from Kazakhstan :)
Can’t believe this. It’s the old lineup. Frusciante too? Got so messed up on drugs he lost all his teeth. What these guys been thru ..
🇳🇵 🇳🇵 🇳🇵 🇳🇵
So glad to see John! I'm glad he's finally back home!
I love this song. Everything is well done. Frunsciate the magic in your guitar is amazing.
John is amazing boys! YOUR BACK
Will Ferrill is crushing those drums!

Didn't they already release this?
НУ вот, Джон вернулся, песни хорошие тоже вернулись! Джон, ты давай завязывай бегать)))))
TRUMP 2024💪💪💪💪
They live and they are strong in our hearts. Xoxo rhcp
esto si es música no esas playadas de bad mierdon o anuel doble mierda
yes yes yes and ffffing yes....THE PEPPER KINGS
Beautiful work!!!   El Señor Pulga con su sarape, que chingón!!!  Aloha Chilis!!! 👏🏽 💖 🔥 🌟 🤙🏽 🙏🏽
Reminds me a bit to Breaking the girl
This is one hell of a cathartic release! Thank you!
Not a great song but ok...at least is not some pop shit like Ariana Grande or Kate Perry.
Yawn on this one
When did the RHCP pick up Will Ferrell as their drummer?  Cool.  \m/
This makes my heart happy
🙏🏾😭❤️
70 an diggin tha peppers..lovin every minute  of it!!
✨👊🏻😎👊🏻✨
Whoever was able to get one of the special (yellow edition) vinyl records for Unlimited Love, I'm pretty damn jealous
Охуенно, как и всегда.)
Can we tag people here? Some new artists need to hear this out.
I ❤️ The Chili Peppers  they are rock legends🌶️🔥🔥🔥🤘
New Song from RHCP, Muse and Korn! Which year is it? (Insert Robin Williams Meme here)
very average song. way too much autotune on the vocals. Kiedas has really gone down hill.
Wen did Anthony become Irish?
My dad literally won’t shut up about how we are gonna see rhcp this summer lmaooo
The same sound, and the feeling is as great and fresh as always.
Wow this sounds like the old stuff, TREMENDOUS 💥
Ten million views in four days is saying something. RHCP are epic... John is our Keanu reeves.
He's back 🙏🙏🙏🔥
Cada vez que escucho este tema es una ocasión especial, John se hizo esperar y demostró toda su magia guardada
that mic stand takes quite a beating, damn
wow Anthony kept his shirt on for over a minute
los amo tanto
RHCP crisp as always 🍟
So ready for the album
Внезапно увидеть эту песню в топе. Понять, что это новая песня. Обрадоваться, что RHCP в порядке, и продолжают делать крутую музыку. Послушать и посмотреть видео - всё на высоте. Отличное начало дня.
🎸🎸🎸🎶🎶🎶💚💚💚
I miss the mother milk/blood sugar/one hot minute days :'(
So Good...!
Segundo 0:47  Frusciante es un geniooo, recién ahora me salto el video nuevo y no sabia nada de esto. La verdad que buen tema,aguante Red Hot locooooo.. saludos desde Argentina Bs.As 9-2-22👏✳️🎵
Welcome back John. We’ve missed you xoxox
Peppers rock! JESUS SAVES!
jonh na areaa
Wow, bout freaking time! John
I really don't like this autotune on his voice.
olha a vibe dessa musica,, mano good Vibes demais
🔥
Keidas looking like Joe exotic.
Grate song that's why you guys are still my favorite band
Anthony really coulda went without the shit and annoying pronunciation lol
Frusciante Is slowly become a funky John wick💜
Anjaayyyy....
I have missed you guys, so very much.
Oh yeah…the RHCP sound is back!
Long life to john
More like Red Hot Irish Peppers
Back to the roots!
Hillel Slovak, Dave Navarro, Josh Klinghoffer and John Frusciante. i loved all of them as guitarists yet John is definitely the one who makes RHCP to reach it's most potential. One of my favorite of all time.
father of the New Kids ;)
So glad to see John  Frusciante back  with his amazing guitar and also Will Ferrell on drums!!
the soul is back....
Esto si es buena música chingada madre.. así se tardarán en sacar algo pero se esperaron a hacer lago de cálida ♥️♥️♥️
INCREIBLE! The RHCP are back! 🙏
Es impresionante lo que hacen con bajo guitarra y bata casi pelados....y siempre suenan bien
Anyone else find it funny that the youngest of the group keeps the most clothes on?
Hello Chili Peppers,good to see you back.
TAKE MY MONEY!!
This shit sucks. Frusciantes guitar work is still amazing but they’ll never come close to BSSM
Will Farrell on the drums killing it!!!
Dope
Love the d.boon sticker on Flea's bass!!
All the pieces just fit right in their place with John back on board. Very excited to hear the new album from start to finish.
Red hot in the next half time of super bowl
In a time when we just wish for something good to happen.... This song comes out from nowhere upon the workshop radio... That was epic..... !!
🍻😎🏝️🏄🏂🏻⛷️🏍️🏎️🏋🏻‍♀️⛹🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♂️🏝️😎🍻
Besides the always incredible guitar work from John, this is boring and totally predictable.  I wish he we go solo again, tbh.
n gostwi
Love that John is back but why is Anthony pronouncing random words  weirdly?
10M views in 5 days! Wow! They just ain't get'n old!
Rhcp back where are others
also heres some nice information about anthony's book he wrote: "  The singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers Describes Repeatedly Raping a 14 Year-Old Girl in Louisiana. The singer for the band “The Red Hot Chili Peppers,” Antony Keidis, described repeatedly raping a fourteen year-old girl in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in his Autobiography titled “Scar Tissue,” released in 2004. "
Frusciante is back
Paedo creeps should do another show on Epstein Island
Es revelador e inspirador que aún hoy sigan saliendo estás bellezas musicales.
Qué bueno que Diego Verdaguer no murió. :')
With John back they’d BETTER play WAYYYYYY more older material especially if they doing stadiums 💜🙏💜   This song F’ing ROCKS btw 🤘💜🤘💜🤘
Johnnies back?! yeah! as he should be💯
Gay
Meh
Red Hot Chili Peppers in 4K never thought about how that would look like until now. Nice to see they’re still putting out music.
how long i wonder before john frusciante gets canceled for his videos years ago where he said the N word multiple times while he was on heroin, he even has a song called N word song but it is actually spelled out and not just N word ? he even says the N word again in his song Enclosure.
Mñe
Love you/under the bridge 🥰👠❤️
Potongannya Anthony kek kang parkir cuk :v
This is awful.
Indonesia Hadirrr...
It's like Eddie Guerrero and John oates fused into one person. Good I guess.
finally music from this band i love it welcome back red hot chilli peppers
Está bien macizo el Anthony
Will ferrel on the drumps HAHA
This is already a classic song!
Estos 4 tipos juntos multiplican exponencialmente su talento. Desde la primera nota de guitarra ya sabes que es John. No sé cómo narices lo hace, pero sabes que es él.
顔にシワは刻まれるが鍛えれば筋肉も刻まれる そんな事を教えてくれるPV
Aeeeee!!! Frusciante tá de volta!  E esse baixo... esse baixo... _Afe_ maria...   Clima gostoso dessa nova música, me remetendo de certa forma à *_Road Trippin'_* .   Já espero que o álbum completo seja muito foda!
Great to see Will Ferrell on the drums again.
My favourite track afther Stadium Arcadium and Scar Tissue...👍😲
I cannot believe they are back! This is amazing
Finnaly
Thanks
Phenomenal!:)✌️🧡🌶️
HOLA
When did Will Ferrell join the Chilli Peppers?
Temazo!!!
Who else from the 80s is still crushing arenas and setting trends.  Only band I can think of is RHCP!!!! I've been listening since the beginning and always will.
Man, this sounds so good.
My god they are back better and better 😊
These gods still are the best ever  😊
cada dia mais me apx por rhcp. só musica FODA!!!
é os fraco
Me and Flea share the same birthday. Cool. Lol
It's à miracle
Crazy that this was uploaded on February 4th which was the day my brother passed 😞 it’s almost like it was ment to be for him bc we both love RHCP and been excited that John came back and now my brother is gone.. RIP brother and love you and I will rock out to RHCP for you while you stand by my side, I may not can see you but I can sense you
Gottdammit its so good to have John back.
Classic 🌶
Super mad dope. Still got it
👆🏻📉👍🏻📀✨
John's and fleas sound IS rhcp!!! John's still using that beat up black m brown fender he's used since atleast Californication.
this song just hit me the first time i listened to it. what a tune! i can see this being in my top 3 RHCP songs
🎶😎🎶
Ver a Frusciante tocar nuevamente es tan bello 🤘🏽
Let's go Brandon
Diego Verdaguer vibes
Wow 😍
I am so happy to see them back.  With or without John they have always been an amazing group - but when they are together there's just.. there's a vibe you get with them.  This song is everything I love about the RHCP and also gives me such nostalgia for earlier/better times.  So glad you're back boys, can't wait to see what you do next <3
LOOK WHO WOKE UP!!!!
So so happy when i seen this as a 90s babies makes me feel great.
Ben Stiller in RHCP. ¿What the hell?
Wow, they're just not taking any chances anymore. Very bland.
It could be no one else. Will take  few listens to love it but its so good to have them back.
Time passes only for me ?  I mean WTF !  Chili Peppers are back !!
Muitos jovens não tem uma oportunidade de mostrar o seu talento, eu imagino o tanto de estrelas que não podem brilhar por falta de condições. Mais com fé em Deus todo mundo chega aonde quer, e nois vamo chegar!
I grew up in Hollywood Hills, Laurel Canyon, Lookout Mountain.  My dad was Buell Neidlinger the famous bass player.  I moved to a small farm town outside of Seattle.  It's nice and friendly there's no crime or smog.  I miss a lot of the cool stuff from Hollywood.
Love it
Frusciante ❤️
¡A huevo! El Flea con un Sarape
incrível como sempre ❤️
i wish i had a friends who like this kind of music :( :) 😎😎🎵🎵
Average song tbh... Miss Josh
Great song, but the mustache must go Anthony!
Filling the void we all had. 👌
a voz dele não muda o ritmo muito bom ainda sim traz a essência de antigamente !
californication vibes. Musically and by the aesthetics
Good old RHCP
This song is pretty average
han vuelto!!! y fieles a su estilo!!! 😍😍😍
I'm glad John Frusciante hired Flea, Chad and Anthony to record some good music ;P
Do I like it? Nope, I bloody love it! 👏🏻 PS: don't fall into the Reggaeton cesspool 🙏🏻
I’ve been growing the same rhcp plant since their last album.   Just thought I’d share…
I want the album to be called.... Iggy pop has a new moustache!
Thank you, Uncle Chad, Flea man John boy and Tony ',-7
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lyrics :-  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
It's not genius by any stretch, but it's RHCP and better than other crap these days
Essa banda nunca perde essa vibe! 🥰💁😎
We don’t deserve the Red Hot Chili Peppers
John 🙏🙏🙏
Still bad ass
Yes yes yes now this is the chillis 🔥🔥🔥
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums. So talented 🙌🙌🙌
Un-fucking-believable
AFTER WHAAAT?? GOOOOD I LOVE READ HOT CHILLI PEPPERS
Thank you for keep on rocking. Thank you for the Guitar Solo!!
Fraquinho
RIP Diego Verdaguer
Quem está ouvindo em 2051 ? 🤣
I love this track. Hoping for some heady psychedelic Johnny jams
Its amazing to see anthony's shape still the same since 10 years ago
How does Anthony stays fit?
Dropped on my birthday, what a gift! I've been waiting ... hell yes!
weeeyyy pinche rolita bien preciosa<3
No one is willing to tell him that mustache looks foolish? He cant decide if he's Iggy Pop or Freddie Mercury. Pretty good song at least
Dude is 59, amazing shape AK, the others are holding up well against Mr Time. Great to hear new stuff from these guys! Great
Tremenda energía.
Pretty hot nice new tune ! Lots of truth in this also.
Me encanta la vibra y el poder de frusciante lo es todo en RHCP
Wow, RHCP released this tune and vid 5 days ago and they have over 10 million views. WOW!!
ROCK ON!
When did you guys get Will Ferrell on drums? Lol Thanks for making more great music.
Ребята, вы никогда не постареете душой✌️ спасибо Вам!
1 of 17 new tracks....so excited for this. Almost 20 years in the making 😍
The Rolling Stones of my generation.
Thirty something years ago I would have never imagined that anyone would still be listening to that little, weird skate rock band featured in the movie Thrashin', yet here we are...
A TUTTO FRUSCIANTEEEEE
Están de vuelta 😎
Man, I'm so sad that Josh had to break away aaaaaah
La raja el tema ctm!! Amor eterno a Frusciante 😍🎸
BLERGH! Miss the old days of Blood Sugar, Mother's Milk, Uplift, etc...
У них Джон Уик на гетаре, хули!
😺 i was DJ   in the  1. year  and i play :     Red Hot Chili Peppers / Under The Bridge (1992) 😺
Justin Long, Keanu Reeves, Will Ferrell, and, um, ... Flea
Is AK doing this whole video tongue in cheek or has he completely lost it?
Anymore new song frm RHCP?
John 💜
Damn.... I love it. Great vibe.
Anjay.. keren
Diego verdaguer sigue vivo, chuladaaa
This is probably the most normal music video they've made
RED HOT CHI............. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
YES! A new hope of better 2022!!
I still enjoy there music today just as much as 30+years ago I wish my body held up as well as these guys
I can proudly say I was blessed to see RHCP live in LA. The best part was, the show wasn’t a huge event. It was Intimate, a small venue which made it that much better.
Yeaaah frusciante !
This band wasn’t the same without Frusciante. Great to have him back. This song is classic peppers. Two thumbs up.
Next video in 4k Please 😭😭😭
And China's on the dark side of the moon...WHAT
No puedo dejar de escucharla, ES ADICTIVA!!! RHCP ❤️❤️
Still making great music. Eerie iridescent melodies
The ending 😍
🔥💥💣💨
🙌
Lo mismo de siempre ya saquen algo Nuevo
Uno de mi grupo favorito regreso con nuevo videoclip
I see John is back from his crusade!
love this, love u
Drummer = Will Ferrell. Guitar = Keanu Reaves Bass = Chuck liddell  Singer = Pornstache from orange is the new black.
WELCOME BACK FRUCIUANTE!!!
👎
Slow Cheetah pt.2 or slowcheetahfornication
Hell yeah! 🔥🔥🔥
impecable, gracias!
I mean yeah they've changed over the years but you can still tell that its still rhcp playing
Woah. I was not expecting that stache.
Tiene la escencia pero como que le falta polenta
Will Ferrell's drumming on point as ever!
Vamoss!! Tremendo! Saludos de parte de #LosHijosDeClaudia desde Argentina!
Awe, the guitar riff is alive and well. This nourished my soul.
Dah pada tua masih pada lincah banget dah ini om om.....keren emang RHCP....
come to brasil!
this is bad.
待ってました！レッチリ！！ いつでも最高にカッコいい！
Will ferrell in fine form on the drums. Nice!
親が好きで好きになったバンドです 出会わせてくれた親に感謝でしかないっすね。
Flea greatest bass inspiration ever, im glad to meet you again.
FEEL FLYING LEGEND 🏃🏻
👏👏👏👏
Eh.. Good to see them back, but this didn’t exactly blow my skirt up.   Frusciante sounds great as usual.
Legends Are Back ❤️
Esto es jodidamente buenoo
from computer: - right click on video - select loop - play and enjoy
90's still alive
bom demais, well done
This little moment "is happiness"
ngeliat kalian gue takut tua. 😭
Good Stuff ...
This better be the worst song on there. Should fire Kiedis and bring back Josh to sing
JHON IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That riff from 0:45 to 0:56 from Frusciante is so refreshing to hear. Josh Klinghoffer is a hell of a guitarist, but Frusciante’s style matches the essence of RHCP’s sound so much better. It’s an ethereal riff to say the least!
Will Ferrell still on drums
They started to sound terrible after Fly quit playing in his underpants
311
QUE CHIMBA !!!
Oh Yeah! From: So LethaL
Wow John finally learn banding technique
killer new chilis
Uma mistura de Scartissue com Under The Bridge.
Will Ferrell is killing it, on the drums
Wow, 10 M views!! RHCP will always rock!
Feb, 8:  6.6 M subs, 10 M views... that's 4 M views more The fvck is wrong with you YT?
Yes
this album reminds me the old albums😍
That vibe we was born!
Kalian semakin menua, tp energi nya tetep muda 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Los 4 fantásticos..
Damn they got really old!
I had bought my first bass the day this song dropped. I took it as a sign, especially since it happened to be a jag like the one in the video
Thought that was Eddie Guerrero singing for a sec
GO CANADA
Great!
I'm so happy for J frusciante
"BLACK SUMMER"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
🔥🔥🔥
Man I love these guys :)
Californication
Peppers ❤️
John ♥️
Muy buen video y muy buena canción...!(si mi hermano Benjamín que murió hace 3 meses lo hubiera escuchado y visto le re encantaría...!)
I wish I could have done the drugs Anthony did and still look that good at 59!
Para mi el mejor grupo de todos los tiempos...gracias por tan buena música..
goood
Ya dem dudes since 94’
Fred Mercury on vocals,  Kojak bassist and KeanuRives on The guitar. Perfect!
Estan de vuelta ❤
I Love  Jhonn, is the Best!!
I FEEL SO OLD FUCK WHO'S NOT???
Oh christ.  They're STILL alive? 🙄
01:52 started crying
JOHN IS A GOLDEN GOD 🔥 can’t wait to see him in September
The peppers are back MFs 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Hey Tony!! Bring back the Top Hat!
Love they're evolving while getting back to the RHCP sound we all love.  Can we all address the elephant in the room ?  I'm going to say it because it needs to be said .. The mustache...Anothy for the love of God ..I thought it was a phase or a statement but it's turning out to be a long-term bad decision . Just saying..I've been a huge fan since  I heard you guys cover higher grown. Unless your  playing a character in Boogie nights 2 .. you need to take the stashe and give it away give it away give it away now.
Another RHCP generic song
Anyone else feel a little blue balled on the solo?
it s forever
Amazing guitar
good song and good video, well done guys!
Can instantly recognize a RHCP drum pattern!!
I am so excited! I get to see them in concert for the first time in September after being a fan my whole life!
Wow...what a grove this song has. The Peppers have always been the masters at the change of tempo which is on full display here. What an uplifting, flowing energetic song. Can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
The Best 😎
Another legendery track, bless this band!!
When he took the the coat off , you knew it fixing to get real.. RHCP=legendary GOAT.
John makes them so much better
Why the mustache ???
Very blah
This is so good. Bloooody hell.
YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just heard this song on the radio while driving to work today. Feb 8, 2022.
Yo... Anybody else get a big Jethro Tull vibe in the build up verses?  Pretty good stuff
Hmmm new RHCP song. Okay let's play.
One love !
You're sound has evolved and you can't cling to the past... sad panda 🐼 😢
Es como el video de Chris Cornell  https://youtu.be/CDhh3DfbiCo
fuck its good to hear frusiante ripping solos in RHCP again
So, are we ignoring how ripped Anthony Kiedis is looking at 59 years of age?
Will Farrel plays awesome drums!
VOLVISTE WACHOOO!!!! 🌶️🔥🔥🔥🙌
Simples e objetivo.
Que maravilha 🤩
Singing about China ! Great 🤮
First let me say I’ll never write music as good as RHCP Never In a million years. I’m a huge fan but this sounds more like an idea/jam that shouldn’t have made an album or dropped as a single. It just lacks the high quality their other singles have with this lineup.
Temazo
This better be on the damn radio.
Fantastic guitar solo !
The pepper i taste when i was a kid still the same taste today. Dang!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Missed this sound. Missed them 💙💙💙
Mantendo a essência original! Obrigada por nos permitir desfrutar da originalidade da banda.
The world could use a new rhcp album. They're right on time...
Thank God for this awesomeness.
Tan abuelos
This is the one band that i have followed my whole life. My older brothers playing Dani California all summer in their room, listening to Don't Forget me on repeat on a train for three days just staring out the window, sitting for an hour after hearing Brendans Death Song for the first time in complete awe. These guys have pulled me out of some dark times and been the soundtrack on my happiest days. I turn 30 this year and mortality is hitting a little different than it used to, I hate crowds, i panic, but I want to experience this incredible music first hand and be able to say I was there to hear the music that changed my life.  I am so happy that John is back on guitar, I loved the last couple albums, but his iconic riffs and criminally underrated voice bring back the Chili Peppers that I grew up with and adored.  All that said, i often wonder if when they write lyrics for these songs Flea is just sitting in the corner trying to see just how much nonsensical BS he can cram into a song without someone saying "You have no idea what that means do you?"  Love you guys, this new one is beautiful, can't wait to see you in Detroit
🥰
Omg song is crazy.
Living legend
❤
I Like this
Nunca erram. Estamos precisando disso 🤩
Sick solo. 🔥
I clicked on this thinking I was just getting a recommended video because I’ve been listening to RHPC lately, it’s kind of a new phase of mine, but then I realize this was only released 4 DAYS AGO??? And here I was thinking this was from the early 2000s or something haha
🤙🌅❤💙🇵🇱🌐👊💙🛸🛸🛸
Red hot chili peppers for ever!
I have a hard time reminding myself, that that is indeed not Will Ferrel playing the drums
It was cool of Keanu Reeves to play guitar and Will Ferrell to fill-in on drums on this
god the drummer and will farrell are twins its weird
Amo 💜
Song sounds like a bunch of bad metaphors and similes that come together to be a big bundle of nonsense... Song sucks
There is no denying Frusciante is vital, VITAL. Love this.
its nice to see will ferrell back on the drums doing what he loves
Sounds like there other 123456 songs
thank you RHCP. Nuff said
What a great solo.
Esse vídeo ficou bem psicodélico, bem a cara do red hot dos anos 2000.
😇😇good
✅✅✅✅
There was a band called 24-7 spyz  from the 90's who should have been as big as rhcp,but they lost it when the lead guitar player got rid of Jeff broadbax.shmfh😠
AMO AMO AAMOOOOO
Welcome Back! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
A song with a guitar solo in 2022!?!? Real music. Nice.
Yay
My favorite band in the whole world...thank you for putting out consistent bangers
Sounds like a red hot!!! Really good
Detalhe é que os caras estão na ativa desde 83... permanecer no topo por 40 anos não é pra qualquer um.
Kinda sounds like Dani California, lol. But I'm glad they are releasing new music. We need more alt rock songs!!!! Tired of all the hip-hop autotune crap!!!!!!
They are now just amazing as they always were...Wow!
The legends are back to bring light in this fluorescent shit hole times
this is the best music to date. I can't stand music these days they all tried hard but it just doesn't work. I grew up best music time 1990 - 2010
Os próximos shows vão explodir de gente tipo no rock in rio 2001, uma multidão de gente quebraram as catracas e invadiram o festival pra ver John Frusciante tocando Californication. Eu lembro desse dia. Foi muito louco.
10 million views in 4 days, LEGENDARY🥲🔥
Great song!
I was weirded out by the celtic accent at 1st. But the more I listen, the more I realize this is the peppers, and it takes me back when BSSM came out.
volvieron los Red hot papá!!! Que nostalgia !!!!! Saludos de Argentina 🇦🇷
Let's release  a summer song in the midst of winter .... no one Rhcp: $$$$
WTF is this shit?  Anthony sounds like an Irish Mexican sober sailor.  He lost his soulful edge.. LOL!
Sorry Bois Danzig did it better.... just my personal opinion...maybe if its played enough ....doubt it tho.... for what it's worth.😶
FRUSCIANTE = MAGIC
John!!!!!!!!!!!!
Simplemente increíble
Maravilhoso amo , red hot
Love 💘❤️ this song!!!!!!!
Fuck ya something that's eases my mind from the world
Awesome 👍🏻
É incrível como essa música é boa!!!!
Anthony Kedis is such a cringe machine. This band would rule without him. Frusciante is a better singer and writes much better songs.
okay
The year of the Peppers.. welcome home, John!!!!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the Moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the Sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailing on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
If it ain't broke...
Song sucks
O mais foda é que eles não perdem a essência, continua sendo minha banda favorita até hj...
Another banger all the old head's in rock,rap, etc. Are going fuckin off this year all fire!!!!
Why it gets such low views?
Fire!
tiger king :v
Hey he is come back?, frusciante?, wooooow this will be the old good RHCP with new spirit born, awesome
Meh. Lo mismo de siempre. No se reinventan nunca estos tipo.
This sounds like Jethro Tull.  Love this and the guitar is amazing 👏
After all these years ... I can't believe all this coolness! Oh wait, yes I can.
O bom e velho RHCP. Parabéns.,
Nice Fuzz Sound ... We're glad Frusciante is back ... SCHLIESS DICH AN (Kämpfe für dein Recht):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWsfaDiG3OQ EMANZIPIERT (mal ganz anders):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu6X7bfzyJA Greetings from Germany ... CLUB OF THE UNCENSORED POETS
its bad... very bad
I love y’all keep doing what y’all do best
Can you remove your moustache, please?
John's back!
Nah........
Los rhcp son increíbles. Cada vez que escucho esta canción me gusta más. ¡Larga vida a los Chili Peppers! ❤🌶
Going to be a classic...up there with the best. Going to be my summer tune for the corvette top down!!
Every time I listen to this song, I get a huge smile on my face, not just because John is back, but because you can feel positive, nostalgic, and happy energy resonating from the music. It's also no surprise how quickly and creatively the four of them are writing together; I'm so excited to hear what else they've written.
John frusciante na guitarra caramba que maravilha,  sadds voltando a adolescência
Not feeling it.  The Chili Peppers used to be so excited.  They've become vanilla caricatures of themselves.
the first time i heard this song .. i was really stoned.. and it was the best idea i've ever had.
Frusciante: 🐐
😍😍😍
Polska przejmuje ten teledysk XD
La que los parió que está bueno esto
this sucks
Excelente, gracias, que grandes recuerdos.
Happy to see RHCP together again !!
🤯🎶🎸RHCP💪💪🇦🇷🇦🇷
sht up and post the lyrics. damn xD
"First three seconds...": I love this song 🥰
What the fuck is up with his weird ass R’s?  Last time, they opened with Dark Necessities, which was immaculate  I don’t know who the fuck this one is for It’s the first RHCP single that left me dramatically underwhelmed  Glad John is back in the mix though
In love😍
LETS GO!! Welcome back, loving the vibes.. God it’s great to see the guys back together, so happy 😀 🔥
Red Hot Chili Peppers:  Anthony kieds  Flea  Jonh Frusciante  Chad Smith  Thank You! I love you guys!
😍😍😍😍
Nice also that there are others still alive and kicking, making music since so many from "my" era are deceased.  Ty RHCP, Tool, Pearl Jam for sticking around and remaining authentic 💜🎶❤️
Kiedis sounds Irish
For whatever reason, I just love how Anthony really pronounces the R's throughout the song.
Increible
Absolutely insane even with decades worth of music they still are able to keep that same sound we all love and it just doesn’t ever ever get old 🐐🐐
Wow
Been a fan for 21 years song is great gives me Stadium Arcadium vibes  , so good when Fleas' bassline kicks in 🌶
Not good!
Under The Bridge meets Slow Cheetah
Coisa linda ver essa banda na ativa
You know who they are. Still, they're always fresh! right?
Same shit for the past 20+ years. Wish they made something like BSSM. Wait i must be high. That was before they became the biggest sellouts.
Dear John, never leave us again.
From Day 1 Nothing New the Sound of RHCP, still Original. 🤘🤘🤘
Is he singing in an Irish brogue? Something is different and I can't put my finger on it
♥️✌️ the true red hot ✌️♥️
Finalmente 🙌🙌  só vem coisa boa nesse álbum novo hein, os caras tão aí 🙏 meus amorzinhos ❤️
Johnny boy is baack...surreal solo...its a full circle for 🌶🌶🌶
This song sound and is exhilarating
Red hot é do caralho👏👏👏😃
Good sond🎵🎼🎶😌
This is incredible!!!!!!
Smooth song
Temazo !! Saludos desde CHILE  The Best  R.H.C.P  😎
🖤🖤🤘🏻
Having Frusc back on guitar makes the fundamental difference between  a good and a great Chilis tune. Not too sure about AK's weird vocal "accent" or the mullet, but otherwise it's the Original Funky Monks 😉
Red Hot Fuckin Chili Peppers!
Ahhh yes feels like home.
se pone cada vez mejor a medida que lo escuchas a cada rato
I can't remember the last time I heard a solo in a song.
BORING
Que música horrível.!! Muito fraquinha....
Did they like hire Will Ferrell for a drummer or something.
Those are some hard Rs, Anthony
no que había muerto el diego verdaguer
Beautiful vocals! Feel fresh and inspired ^.^
Anthony sounds like he got super into sea shanties while writing this album
love the prhase.  and china is on the dark side of the moon
man ima be honest, this s the best song by them. And I like 40 songs from them, you probably wont see this but YOUR THE BEST RHCP!!!!!!! KEEP IT UP :))
Botafogo chills
Not bad
VUELVE A SER RHCP
Não me surpreendeu, achei bem fraca
I don't care what anyone says, Chili peppers are not the same without Fruciante!
Omg 🤒🤒
Que bien envejecen
Awesome my favorite 90’s rock group & in 2022 you’ll still GOT IT!
Nice job!  You're almost as good as me
I'm so glad to see you together again!...what a wonderful and beautiful song! What an inspiration!... Thank you for sharing with us. I'm looking forward to buy this album. I hope it be very soon! We love you dears RHCP...! 🎼🎵🎸👍
I thought this was a parody when I saw Been Stiller singing and dancing. Confirmed when I saw Will Ferral on drums!
tmr Anthony Kiedis está viejo :(
Anthony's mullet makes my day!
How can a song 4 days old feel so nostalgic this is amazing
You just know Ant is a Super Mario fan with that stache
Me ha gustado mucho el ritmo instrumental es muy bueno, el vocalista es brutal y le doy un 10/10
My god, that really is John! Love to see him back and he really is one of the best guitar players ever!
Crap
Got tix for the show this summer!! YESSS
This song is growing! the solo is amazing
Good to see Will Ferrell back workin’      Yes it was sarcasm, old and immature.
So STOKED for this!  Welcome back John!  We missed you!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, terrible
My ears are bleeding
Please make the new album 100 songs ❤
Below average, just awful
Am i the only one that gets that Western Movie vibes from this?
Didn´t expect to like this..stupid me...John is back!!!
Kinda sounds like the island boys song lol
A essência do RHCP é essa batida, é essa voz 😍❤️
Sounds a lot like Stadium Arcadium
Yes
This sounds like my favorite music.  <3
👆🏻📉👏🏻
kiedis looks like tony levin with hair now
Larga vida a Diego verdaguer
We follow in the same footsteps further and further and further and further to infinity ....
I love this!
Boring
Why does he look like Tiger King
Wow 10 million na
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Envelhecemos junto com os Red Hot Chili Peppers... Que bom!
Why is Will Ferrell on the drums tho? He really put the testicles to the drum set.
Vocalista ta com a cara do tiringa...
Oh God its perfect its perfect.
John Frusciante！！！！！！！！！！！
-Lyrics-  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the Moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the Sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailing on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Still got it.
Anthony Kiedis is 59. 👀😍
frusciante carrega
Slow cheetah part 2
G.O.A.T. RED. HOT.CHILI 🌶
This song reminds me of the Stadium Arcadium album. I have to confess that I feel that with John's return, the connection and energy of the band is back.
I love ya'll, you've been getting me through the years guys, let's keep going into the nothing together
😭😩😭😩😭😩 together again

https://youtu.be/TCSUKIhjevo
Will Ferrell is such a great drummer!!!
Incrível ver que A banda ainda está sincronizada! Amo 🇧🇷💓
Wonderful👍
No lie, I’m grateful they decided to put out new material.
I’ve been listening to these guys since I was in the womb! They’ve helped me through some really bad depression throughout my teenage years and early 20s. After 28years, I’m finally going to see my heroes at Solider Field and I can’t wait !
Great song, great band. I’m so glad John is back. Don’t get me wrong, Josh is an extraordinary musician but, what can I say? I love the man!
The vibe of this sound is the mirror of the band...... Of a rebirth!
Otra joya de los chili peppers !!! Abrazo y toda mi admiracion  desde buenos aires argentina !!!!
curti por depreciar a China.
é mais do mesmo mas é red hot né
Got that hair dyed for real. Lol
So much emotions and da solo 🤯🥵🌶🎸😮‍💨🛐👏thank you RHCP 🥲
Mc fly et carlito
Je kif j’adore !
God
Saudades
This got me smiling crying tears of sheer joy, i can feel that epic energy is back ! super awesome !
Pinché canción espectacular
It's been a while since I heard anything RHCP...ahh Flea is in the House!
been missing their music for so long. video got that 90´s vibe with that background and all...
Inoxidables 🔥🔥🔥
Foreveeeeeer guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The intro is great, then straight downhill from there, hitting rock bottom at the refrain.
awesome
JOHN FRUSCIANTEEEEEEEEE <3
This is atrocious.
A breath of fresh air.
Anthony looks fucking amazing for his age and so happy to see John back. Good song, I hope we get some funky shit on the album though. Funky peppers is best peppers imo.
Will Ferrell still fire on the drums.
Caracaaa, mt foda, amei, come o brasil plis
Signature sound to the max. Dig it, but that's going to be a no for me on the sarape.😵‍💫
Well,  I think it's best their song from 2006..!
Love it
I screamed when I saw this… my biggest dream is to go to their concert 😭😭😭 I really don’t wanna die without experiencing it
Pancada BRASIL
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
😎😎😎😎
LO MEJOR
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeess!!
мужики, ви красавчики!!!! просто не має слів!!! я дуже радий що ви разом з Джоном! RHCP Forever!!!
Lo máximo!
Yes the boys are back.
Can't believe all these guys are nearly 60 years old. They all look not only great but also continue to create amazing tunes
dude FUCK YES. i knew as soon as the vocals came in that this was going to be an amazing, nostalgic feeling song
The only thing that’s going to end the black summer is another 1994 crime bill, come on Biden I know you want to! 😂
Good to see Will Ferrell keeping his chops on the drums 👍
Totaler Bullshit!!! Schau, da ist der abgewrackte Antony K. Mit Arsch Gesicht FLEA
i straight up started crying
Rubin should not let them release it as a single :/ It's a b-side at best. It's even mix/mastered like b-side.  And on the top of that they produced  video with band performing in front of stock photos. What were they thinking.
So good to see Will Ferrell on the drums! He has come a long way since Cowbell
Just Frusciante and friends :)
10 million views 4 days it just keeps going up as it should
Glad its not about California lol
This got me back to 00's. Long life to Frusciante
Master john 🙏🤲
Regresé a mi adolescencia 😍 increibles como siempre!! ❤
John and his guitar 🙌
Lixo
I’m glad will Ferrell still in the band
I love this band but wtf is this 😆
10 million views let's go! I was here. ⬇️
Its a new song but it brings such a nostalgic feeling, only RHCP to bring us joy in these darker times. GO PEPPERS!!!!
THIS SONG HAS SO MUCH LIVE PERFOMANCE POTENTIAL OMG, CANT WAIT TO HEAR AND SEE THEM LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you RHCP. This is beautiful.
Not the same take me back to zephyr song
So cool they got Will Farrell to play drums for this music video!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
John is back.
Valeu por mais essa música foda!
I just realized how political and philosophical RHCP songs are.
Bunch of brainwashed fools up in here.
John Frusciante
Very happy to see against the red hot chili perppers together!! I want to see this New album
Dancing like Bez from Happy Mondays, enjoyed the song.
Je suis le seul à chercher des français qui parle de Mcfly Et Carlito ? 🤡 🛐
Like from Brasil \,,/
Siempre RHCP 🌶❤🇺🇾
Frusciante is back! Yeesssssss!!!
Welcome home John, it's good to see you again...
awesome vibes
Will Ferrell can still rock those drums !
Huge song, very inspirational. Spills vibes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik all over, just what every RHCP fan of us would want in these troubled shallow times...
Fruscanti makes them so much better great tune
Arthur Shelby on vocals!!!
The best
really good song
Coool 🐯🐯🐮🐕🤩🍍
Regresaron❤
10 milhoes
Mmmm…this feels like summer and good memories.
F*ck me, it's Tom Selleck!
I love this
Loving the retro modern californication era sound
Why's Anthony singing with an Irish accent?
Good to see the peppers back amazing
These guys have made some great music but this is dull. I’ll take Dani California over this any day!
Rhcp os melhores
Крутяк! Вы крутые!
Esses gostam do que fazem👏👏👏 muito bom
Thank you!!
This is what I’ve been waiting for! RHCP for life!
Qualche ruga in più, ma si, sono loro 💓
Zzzzzzzzz
Good to see John Wick is back
Jeee❤️❤️❤️🎧🎶🎵🔊
I’ve missed this feeling.
Por fin música nueva con guitarra, bajo y batería!!! Mis oidos ya sangraban con tanta mierda de trap
only here bc of big john
A los no fanáticos, escuchen este tema muchas veces, muchasssss
very crazy to see them all together after so many years without seeing them together
Normally the bands when they get older, they stop being seen on camera. But I love the naturalness of this band and in the end, we all get old. Sorry for my english <3
frusciante is god, kiedis - not so
Just hearing him playing man!
Así como mi vida se apaga, hay algo que siempre la enciende, los Red Hot Chili Peppers son responsables, de que mis veranos no sean tan negros! Te amooooo Red Hot.
It is so triumphant to see John back up there with the boys. Never missed a step
Wow! That's just awesome! Love to see John back
Frusciante, Kiedis, Flea y Chad vamoooos RHCP
So glad Will Ferrell is back on drums!
A guitarra é otima! O resto... É o de sempre.
nunca defraudan chicos! Una vez más la rompen! Gracias
Has anyone else noticed this uses the same drum pattern as Californication just a different tempo!?
3.54 minutos de Felicidad  3.54 minutes of Happiness
Genios
Why is it only #14 in trending for music when 10 million views in 4 days outperforms almost all other songs on the list, only matched by the number 1 song, from what I can see?
Will Ferrell hasn't changed a bit
The happiness and joy that is on Flea's face while sitting on his best friend's shoulders is what cures depression.
Has kind of a Slow Cheetah vibe.
no no give me Josh back John! - you are - rhcp! but now - no let Josh do it - Josh - is rhcp now!
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Обожнюю вашу ліричну музику, з любов'ю з України) 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Jooooohn we fucking love you
Anthony's hairstyles and mustache are a national treasure.
VAMBORAAAAAAA
What up with hard R’s... about time John came back
Ummmm it’s ok much better then what’s popular these days
Sorry guys, i love the band but this is "cry macho"...
Es hermoso verlos juntos y este tema me trae esa mezcla de bonitos sentimientos logran ponerme tan feliz !  Los amo Peppers 🥰❤️
Im a fan.  But the drummer exept for a couple of song.  Do always the same old beat we can hear everywhere everytime.  This band deserve a better drummer
Just like the music not the video
🎶🎶
I love RHCP but this is not song I was waiting for. Flee muted  and John more of the same. Looks like safe bet or luck of imagination.
This feels like home. <3
Gracias por volver, RHCP 4EVER!!!!
Lo mejor es lo mejor 👌👍🏻
Seems like the biggest criticism is that the new Red Hot Chili Peppers sounds like the Red Hot Chili Peppers 😂😂.  Welcome back boys. ✊❤️
Finalmente ❤️
What a great song cant wait to hear the rest of the album
ジョンイズゴッド
alternative on its best! great job guys :D
Os caras são bons.... a letra não diz nada com nada mas a musicalidade é sensacional..... muito feliz que minha banda preferida voltou!
The intro is so damn EPIC! Getting chills every time
Mira yo pensé q Diego Verdaguer ya se había muerto jejeje chiste gastado...
It is so fucking beautiful
È ritornato Frusciante :)
2022 and Anthony Kiedis can even rock a mullet! xd
omfg I'm speechless
Red hot chili Peppers: the Return ♥️
Como cuando esperas que el futuro haga algo y vienen del pasado a hacer más que lo  que tenemos ahora por presente y futuro!  Wey siguen enseñando ! Siguen creando obras de arte! Mis respetos.
Esses caras são demais, fazem parte da geração 90, só quem viveu sabe o quanto essa banda representa e continua representando.
10m views in 4 days . wow They are still relevant :D
até agora não parei de vir aqui
So good to hear Johns voice on a RHCP song again.
Welcome Back John
John being back brings me life.
This is actually a very poor RHCP song. Lyrically it is bloody awful. There is nothing new happening here musically. Extremely disappointed with this return. If this is the lead single from the new album it doesn't bode well. I was hoping once Frusciante was back they would return to form. Unfortunately it appears that isn't the case.
John The Good Lord Frusciante is back!!
omggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg i'm cryyyyy
WOW!
10 million views
I can hear autotune on the vocals. FFS!
Ya quiero escuchar esta Canción en Vivo!
Lo mejor que le ha pasado este año, Los RHCP están de Nuevo en Acción
average nothin that impressive. Sounds like everything else they have already done.
Wait?! Are you telling me Anthony is actually older than my dad?? Can't believe it
grande Diego Verdaguer
I expect anything from these guys love this
Che pena…
John Frusciante🌶🔥🔥🔥
Eternally grateful!
Nice to see Will Ferrel got back into drumming.
Lo hicieron de nuevo! ¡Epic!
Feels like the whole World is starting to heal.
wait, they still exist?
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
This guy Will Ferrell is awesome on the drums 😅
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF                   uuuuuuuuuu                                                           ccccccc                                       kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk                                 Yeah
Superbe morceau , le final  est encore meilleur, top 👍😉
These guys have come so far its just crazy. One of my favorite bands growing up, they were so out there. You'd never think, yea in 30 years these guys will be iconic rock legends. MIND BLOWN
Will ferrell is so good. Unbelievable
So exciting to see the fantastic 4 back together! All the chills and fuckin great music still, all these years <3  the best of the best for me
Good to see will Ferrell take a break from movies and come back to the music scene
10 million in 4 days <3
still sounding good
Εξερετικοι
That outro is a vibe
Will Ferrell still killing it on drums.
Dirty Black Summer >
Just happy to see John back!!!
Great to hear that sound again. Guess who's back.. back again!!
🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br🔰br
abnananannanananananananna naaaaasheeeee ansaheeeeee nashe nasheee anaaaaasiee
un temazo
I lovy RCHP!
Absolutely awful,
This gives me the same feels as when Dark Necessities hit, but even more so! His voice sounds so good, and the band is so tight! I hope I can catch a live show this year guys!
This is totally a real RHCP tune, awesome. But why did they get so quiet?
☮✌🏽
YES.
Im So glad, that John Is back. You can hear it And feel it just by listening to this song, the missing piece finally came back. However thanks for Josh for not letting this band die
J’espere que la mission red hot va marcher et que Mcfly  et Carlito pourront enfin vous rencontrer franchement si vous refusez vous perdez une occasion de rencontrer des personnes incroyables 😊👍
Gracias por tanta música de la buena,años y años ... simplemente los mejores
Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
boffff
I don't know why it reminded me of "This Velvet Glove" and "Savior" 🤔
Esto es oxígeno, por favor más, q nuestra generación wsta al borde borde colapso con la música actual
I got mix feelings about that one. Great to see them together and still getting some recogniton after all those years. But this song is not quite inspired. Everything is forced and flat. Sounds really pushed by management to get some momentum before an album release in spring before the summer tour. And the most dramatic is that they must have a bunch of songs unrevealed, and they choose to post this one, I cant imagine the rest.
simplemento hermoso ❤ 🔥🌶🧂
Отличная песня! Такое ощущение, что Джон никуда не уходил.
Too much video - too less music. Disappointing.
This sounds like a parody of the band from californication onwards.
My God an ecologist song,  this is like being in a timewarp to much happier times. REVOLUTION ARE BACK
I remember being seven, watching MTV's Top 10 and They always comed at #1. Let it be.
fucking AMAZING like always
Не верится что здесь Киддису 59 лет. Ему бы ещё шорты вернуть как в Стадиум Аркадиум - было бы вообще круто.
fuck, this is real...RHCP is back...been some time, welcome back!
Música simplesmente fantástica.... Quero voltar aqui em 2030 e curtir esse comentário, e relembrar esse dia.
Старички всё еще могут. Очень рад, что Джон вернулся в семью. Красные Горячие Чили Перцы в моём сердце навсегда.
NICE SONG NICE SOUND NICE MIX  LOVE YOU.THANKS THIS IS GOOD FOR WORLD SOO!!
John was born with that Stratocaster
Muito ruim
pretty wild they got will ferrel to drum for them
Time to get obsessed over music once again
i wonder how anthony STill looks so youthful? he’s like a vampire. J uicing ? it’s AMazing. is hE blesSed?
I’m glad John is back
Great song. 🤙 Indecisive about Anthony’s mullet though. 🤔
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
At last.........I'm SOOOO ready for this new music.  Love to see the boys back together with JF.  Black Summer is a great teaser for what is sure to be a RHCP Summer for me and all of us who want to feel some Unlimited Love.  And that's a good thing.  Thank you for doing you.
When i grow up i want to be like Flea 😀
Anthony Kiedis = Iggy Pop
Нормалёк !
God I’m so glad John is back.
QUE OBRA DE ARTE
Essa música tem uma vibe inicio anos 2000 muito boa
This is the best song I’ve heard from the Chili Peppers in a long time.  That said, Anthony Kiedis looks like the guy that lived on the end of the block when you were a kid and his orange firebird was always on a jack in his driveway needing to be fixed and his sleeveless jean jacket always smelled of weed.
Fucking legends
Fantastic!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍
RHCP songs tend to grow on you w each listen.    I think it's a key component to their longevity.
ummm no
💫
This is maybe the best Chili Peppers song to come out in a decade
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove!!!!+
Stolen from Sofia Bolt - get out of my head
Didn't know Joe Exotic was released.
Nem vi a música já dei like
I've been waiting on a new song from the world's most favorite quartet of the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!
Твою мать!!! Как же круто !!!!!♥️
Anthony sporting the Frank Zappa mustache & goatee ... Very good !!!
They started as a a hyper energy cover band.
Great song!...  I've come back everyday for a listen. cant wait for the album
Well I was less than impressed. They have some big shoes to fill. But I’ll assume that’s my least favorite song on the album. Enjoyed hearing John’s tone though.
nice to see Will Ferrell on the Drums again
Does the verse remind anyone else of REM's shiny happy people verse?  I dig it!!!
And China on the dark side..of the moon
This song has a little bit of The Doors vibe and sound. I love it.
Looking like they created some new Tik Tok dances 😂
RHCP thank you , I was younger because of you now :)
Will be at 10 million views within a couple hours
geus karolot jier.berarti uing oge
Rhcp freaking Legends 👏
Wie lange mussten wir warten. Das hört sich doch wieder nach den Chilis an.
cool auto-tuned vocals
Amei muito bom...como todas as outras ,tá um espetáculo 😍😍😍😍
I miss Under the Bridge days 😔
If you happen to get a chance to hear this song even without a video, you will definitely know its RHCP.
Los amo, John sos vos, volvieron los Peppers oscuros de Californication? Mambeooo maaalll
I really miss to see you guys and John is here finally 🖤
hmm... i'm still wainting...
🤩😍🥰❤❤❤
Its awesome to see John Frusciante back 💓☺
Will Ferrell is such a cool drummer....Jim Carey sings well also...
Anthony Kiedies out here combining a bowl cut, mullet, and a pawnstache 😂
Te amo frusciante
Weak
Still the greatest ❤
Every time these four guys get   back together it's god damn amazing, it's like they were meant to break up and come back at the right time.........well its the right time
This song is my happy place. Every time I put it on I get teary eyed and have the biggest smile on my face. It's amazing to have them back <3
Первое видео в этом году, которое я посмотрел с оригинальной скоростью, без ускорения )))
Keidis and his voice, Frusciante is back, Flea refusing to lose his smile, and Ferrel with his signature drum grooves. Please, do never change.
Another bite?.....SURE Y NOT?!
me emociono mucho ver a frusciantes de nuevo
Sounds like 2001 again
LSD FEELING
I missed the sound of john guitar soo much
se nota que volvio frusciante y se fue el otro muerto que no tocaba ni el arroz con leche.
I love this new music. But I feel a big void now knowing what I know about Anthony, it makes me really sad and nearly makes it hard to enjoy this to its full extent.
Fuckin' legends ! 🌶🔥🔥
AMO LOS RED HOT ! QUE PAZ ME DAN SALUDOS A ALGUIEN DE ARGENTINA !
Still delivering quality songs and the production on this one is outstanding!
Living legends... almost 10 million views in 4 days that's crazy 👍🏽💪🏽🤘
Don´t know what to think....
🤯🤬can you believe I was skeptical that they could do it again 😭👏🏽
just wow.
porra, mas essa banda sempre sendo do caralho hein mané
John Frusciante is a legend 🎸🎸❤❤❤💪💪💪😘
Gracias ❤️🇲🇽
А я плачу,то ли от радости то ли от грусти душевной,но,прям,торкает.слушаю их  уже18лет и в радости и в горе,)))и дальше буду слушать!!!¡!!!
I love this 🤟
Looking like Eddie Guerrero in this video
Wow how did they get Keanu Reeves as their guitarist??
riding on a headless horse to make the trip....  love the song but how bout the video?  Really badass too gotta admit
Welcome back Johnny.
💓💓💓💓
amazing
Still the same ol’ dudes!!!!  Rock on!!!
❤‍🔥
Nothing against Josh, I m even think that the last album have some good bangers there, but... THIS GUITTAR from Jonh Frusciante is fucking emotional It give me exactly what I loved from RED HOT, this feeling,
00:47 to 00:56 is the glory
After all these years, they're still good!
Fruisante solo!🔥
As viúvas do John já podem parar de chorar.
This song is kind of boring :/ don't understand why so many people seem to appreciate it
GRANDE LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, LOS ESCUCHO DESDE QUE TENIA 15 AÑOS, HAORA TENGO 22    lmL (0.0) lml
This will become one of the greatest RHCP songs.
<3
Get rid of Rap garbage and bring back normal music like this.
Why is he singing like a pirate?
Good to see them back. I'm happy for those super fans
Incrível como sempre 😍
Нееее... Нууу... Не то бляядь😞😞😞😞
Goosebumps.
We waited an eternity for the true follow up to Stadium Arcadium. This is well worth the wait. (Klinghoffer was good, but you could definitely hear how much was missing without Frusciante.) Finally, the ultimate RHCP is back!
Frusciante is such a king on the guitar. The whole band is awesome but his guitar has always reminded me of Hendrix.
Seeing John back makes me more happy than anything has in the past 2 years
a musica é boa, regis tadeu babaca
Great theme for a covid documentary :) .
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE everything but Anthony's hair cut but I can live with that.  THANK YOU
This is a big thing in the history of music!!!!!
I honestly think that they only get better the older they get!
The Chili Peppers are everything but mainstream 😉
When did tiger king start singing for the chili peppers
Aqui é BR porraaaaaaaaaaaaaa
ILUMINAT CRAP 🤢🤮🤮🤢🤮 JUST N.W.O SLAVES
Boring song
Hated RHCP growing up, but now since all music is rap mumbling garbage, RHCP sounds like heaven sent
Sounds like my childhood… thanks for the timewarp 🤘🏽
Will Ferrell still killin the drums lol jk chad
Anthony, what happened on that famous island you visited?
This song sucks... horrible And I love rhcp
SONG OLD SCHOOL
first of all ... musical innovation 😂
Beautiful Great song..RHCP Rock
Looks like a lockdown haircut.
Sounds like Stadium Arcadium but a little different
The band performed a free concert in downtown Cleveland, Ohio in April 2012 in support of President Obama's re-election campaign . yikes
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Love the song, love the band, love the vibes, but damn that mustache whhhyyyyyy 😭😭😭 I could've forgotten the haircut but.... Too violent for me 😂😂😂
This music video gives me vibes about me in a tesla at night, listening to this. it never gets old =)
Will Ferrell on the drums. Nice.
What a tune, what a flow.....absolutely loving it....staying true to their distinctive sound!....on repeat today 🥰
Ameii
RHCP forever.
this RHCP line up is my favorite of all time
damnn!!
🐅🐅🐅
Love it
Like they never missed a step
Frusciante...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ RHCP 🎤🥁🎸🪕
Пойдёт.
Caralho eu não canso dessa msc nuncaaa. Mal lançaram e eu já sei de cor kkkkkkkk
Going back to the roots 🤘🏻
My impression was that with this track they tried very carefully to grope the right way in order to absolutely avoid any wrong moves which can put under question the commercial success. No revolutions any more , no tears, no challenges and protests. Just light calm philosophy. The only hope was John, but alas.. A bit boring stuff..
Hot DAMMM, the Red HOtt CHILLI  PEPPERS     <<  ArE BaCkk  RrOcKiNg  iT  HAarD >>  Not bad for a bunch of guys in there Fiftys.
The peppers need to disintegrate from time to time in order to reform again. That keeps them alive. Can't wait to see them live this summer.
Glad to see him back 😃😄😁

Bravo Guys, Bravo!!!!
I missed you guys. Please visit Prague on next tour !! This song is awesome !!!
Disappointing..
Of course, the Chili Peppers deliver that sweet sweet soul that you love and need from their music.  These guys are absolutely legendary!
<33
Essa música é como se tivesse trazido minha adolescência de volta. Que maravilhoso isso.
Truly fucking love this!!!👍😁
He's back
Andy's vocals are lacking this track.
Will Ferrell is great on the drums
I guess you can still go to the well. I don’t think that well ever really goes dry. What comes out just evolves. Nice work!
É impressionante como essa música só melhora a cada vez que escuto. 🌶❤️
Vibe clássica, de volta às origens! Sobretudo com a volta do John <3
Thanks for your
Good to hear them again, can't fault em n still going strong 😁💪👍

Amazing sound, amazing song. Thanks RHCP.🥰
Is this a *Inhales* JOJO REFERENCE
Hey this is the same screen used on The Mandalorian! Love the song and this looks amazing!!!
I really really respect Josh's effort and input during the last years, i think he was the perfect replacement for John - and even more......but THIS is the legendary line up. Like Deep Purple's Mark II. There are so many memories connected with this line up.....from my teenage days with "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" to "Californication" and "By the way" which mark a little bit the best years i had and finally "Stadium arcadium" which i heard with my then-2-years-old daughter..... And now they are back......and i have tears in my eyes.....
OH MY GOD
YESSS
Thanks for coming back Jhon!!!!
Pop sem vergonha, fraco, batido, infelizmente, musiquinha de rádio sem vergonha.
With so many artist who pass early in life, years later you're left wondering what their music would be like if they hadn't passed. Jimi Hendrix, Curt Kobain, Freddie Mercury to name just a few. I'm glad RHCP are together, healthy, and I get to still hear beautiful music they are creating.
this is a recicled sounds, of other RHCP songs.  i waiting something more Amazing. but that good for Red Hot... and New vídeo.  Long Live The Rock.
Love how the audio isn’t synced to the visuals when playing drums
Meh 🤷‍♂️ it’s alright
They are back
Sempre incríveis! A mesma essência, do jeitinho que todo mundo gosta! :D Finalmente voltaram!
Sun goes down...
Welcome back Red Hot Chili Peppers, welcome back John Frusciante!!!
Kcalb Remmus
Shattered me to pieces. "Ridding on a Hilly's horse to make the trip" I don't wanna be rude here, if it were God who gave you the talents since the day you were born and if you give all this credit to otherwise than you must be the dumbest star i ever fan of. And if am trying to safe you here as I love you so much than i really mean it.
having john back in the chilis is like having a dead relative come back to life.
QEPD Diego Verdaguer
Uff... so epic...
Maaaan that's the peppers I know and love.  So glad John is back.
❤️💗
Will Ferrell on drums...
When the world needed them most.
Мне 33,слушаю РХЧП с 15 лет...плачу и смеюсь и росту и падаю и меняюсь вместе с ними..учила "американский" с ними.плачу и смеюсь вместе с ними!Антони,дай Бог Тебе здоровья радовать нас искусством своим
Is that Will Ferrell on the drums?
Don't like!!!!
Wow just wow
Amazing
Flea is the glue of these Funky Monks.  We must protect him at all costs.
Do I detect a wee bit of an Irish accent, lads?
🍾🧠🎶💨💪🏻💥💣🔥
Muy al estilo de under the bridge pero muy buena thanks rhcp
PROUD OF LEGEND IS BACK 💯
Fly stuck Lenin on the guitar. I wonder if he would stick Hitler? Both Hitler and Lenin murdered a similar number of people.
Will Farrell is killin it!
it's really good to see these guys back :D
Перцi все такiж вогнянi! Суперово!
大好きな曲
Legendary frusciante is back
Oh shit its the legend John Frusciante!!
You're here coz you got good taste 💯
Epic song and solo. Will Ferrell killed it on drums as allways
Más de 10 años sin Frusciante, y ahora que regresa a la banda me sigue transmitiendo tanto como en los anteriores álbumes. Un grande, tanto él como Chad, Anthony y Flea.  Presiento que Unlimited Love puede ser un gran disco.   ¡Larga vida a los Peppers! 🌶️
Pretty sure a single tear fell from my eye when John was shown for the first time in the video. He’s back. They’re back. Love these dudes.
Am I the only one who, just for a second, was like "Is that Will Ferrell on drums?!"
BORING!
I feel this is speaking for native americans... actually many cultures that have been destroyed by colonization. I love RHCP in every way,  and they keep giving me more insight, along with joy!
These dudes have been playing the same damn song for 40 years lol.
Best song I’ve heard in ages. They are definitely still RED HOT chilli peppers 🔥🌶🌶
awesome!!!
I thought It was trashy, right until John's solo...
yeaah L.A vibes!!! ;)
So so powerful in uplifting the spirit! At 66 years old I can not get enough of this enlightened music.
Is Anthony doing an accent or something?
John makes them whole again, love it!
Like 👍 from Ukraine 🇺🇦 Є ще хтось теж з України?
Where's the funk
Italy love RHCP 🇮🇹♥️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Gordon Lightfoot wants his style back
Invitenle algo a Chad a ver si se esfuerza con esa batería jaja la melodía estaba buena hasta que entró :(
Nostalgia maravilhosa 😍🇧🇷
JOHN!!! OMG!
Oro puro!! Increible de principio a fin!!
🔥
Thanks, thanks, thanks!! My best Band❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻☀️😍
che stile,,, Awesome time  to be alive!!
#REDHOTAREBACK
👴🎶
AAAAAAAWEEESOOOOOOME. .DUDE...
So fresh this sounds really impressed with the sound
What pedal gives that washed out guitar sound?
Espectacular!!!!
BELIEVE IN MOUSTACHE
John is an ascended master!
오...프루시안테 ㅜㅜㅜㅡㅠ
Anthony = pak Raden n Chuck Norris
I HEARD THIS SONG ON THE CAR RADIO AND GOT MAD AT MY DAD WHEN HE TURNED DOWN THE VOLUME because I was trying to write the lyrics so I find the song- anyway here I am lol, it's nice to discover new old bands sometimes
Anthony Kiedis is turning into Iggy Pop!!
La musique peut changer le monde, car il peut changer les gens
Good to see John back
For a second i thought Will Ferrel was on the drums.
So glad to see John Fruciante back!!! He was so missed!
the beat of the drum sounds like californication isn't it?
0:46 the stratocaster I wanted to see 🤩
RHCP made a new song. If this wasn't enough,  then nothing can fill your thirst.
Feels great having John back, it's like a RHCP back in the day, same energy on the riffs
Sin desmerecer a Josh Klinghoffer, quien hizo buen trabajo en sus años con Red Hot... Pero Frusciante siempre fue la pieza fundamental en las composiciones de RHCP,  y la quimica que tiene con Flea siempre ha sido Magistral, volver a escuchar RHCP junto a Frusciante te devuelve esa esencia de la epoca dorada de la banda...
0:45  .....eminem
Это круто)) from Russia with love))
Beautiful track. Sounds like a song I heard before.. Just like a RHCP track 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see someone playing this off a boombox the day Tiger King gets released from prison
ohh yeahh
One of the purest and smoothest Rock bands of all time.
volvió flea gaucho 🛐🛐🛐
El mejor cantante de rock que existe, seguido de cerca por el de Incubus.
Шикандос
Watching Anthony do the Techno Viking is absolutely worth the watch alone.
Anthony looks like a 70’s pornstar ….
Alright - not quite enough satanic messaging for the average joe though
So glad Frusciante is back ❤
what the hell is will ferell doing here??
Una más.. no es la gran cosa ésta canción.
I don't think they're capable of creating bad music.
his voice DOESN'T CHANGE I can't understand
Simplemente hermoso, no pierden el toque
Didn't know Will Ferrell could play the drums so well 👍🏼. Good song.
John Frusciante ❤️
It's as if they never left
queria agradecer
Oh great, Will Ferrel is playing drums again!
New favourite rhcp song
hey y'all saved 2022 congratulations
Amazing song!!!
Casi me cago encima, que bestiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
I feel like every Chile Peppers song takes a good 10 times to listen to it before it goes from good to great then 10 more to amazing.
I'm indonesian but.....PLEASE COME TO BRAZIL
Amazing.......... The Best Song
Te amo john
Why is Will Ferrell on the drums? 🤔
나 죽어
It's been a long time but they are fucking back! This song reminds me of the Californication album, and Frusciante plays like in BSSM. It's like travelling in time. Awesome.
say what again
Nice to hear john frusciante again and the group together again can’t wait till June gonna be watching them in Manchester 🤟🏼
Sorry, but this is boring as hell. Just more of the same. Hope the rest of the record will be better.
LETS GOOO FRUSCIANTE WE LOVE YOUU
Os caras sempre fazendo clip com tela verde,classico....
shiiiiiiiiiiit 🔥🔥🔥
IN LOVEE <3
Офигенно!!!!
"And China's on the dark side of the moon." But don't worry, because... "Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement."
The video is almost as good as the song, well done.
With John F their chemistry is complete. Wonderful what these Minstrels can create amongst themselves to share with us all.
It sounds close to "By the way" - soft and harmonic. Not bad but not awesome...
This sucks
Been a fan since Californication
Love it.  Reminds me of both Californication and Midnight from By the Way.  So glad to see John back, too.
😍
welcome back John!
Great song! Those drums are so good when they come in! So happy to hear new music from them. Great musicians - that guitar was so clean too
💔🖤🔥
show!!
Classic RHCP music 🌶️ ♥️
I love rhcp <3
It's good, it's really fucking good :)
💢💥🔥👏👏
😬👎🏼🤷🏻‍♂️
Salute to them #Redhotchillipeppers for ever❤
THEY ARE AMAZING...LIKE A WELL AGED SCOTCH....PERFECT
I thought it was #Will #Farrel on the drums
🤮🤢💩
John F ❤
I am so happy!!! I've been waiting for a new album for years. And finally my wish is there. I saw the RHCP for the first time in Germany / Bielefeld - at the PC69 on March 16th, 1992 and have been a huge fan ever since. Thanks guys for the intense and brilliant music of all time. Thanks that you exist! You have always accompanied me in the good times and the bad times of my life... THANK YOU

This is shit.
boring. pls. retire.
1:52 Oh sh... FRUSCIANTE IS BACK!   Can't wait to see them live again.
I COULD HEAR AN OVATION WHEN JOHN APPEARED ON THE SCENE
And not one dislike🖤🖤🖤🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Супер!
Will Ferrell looks better than ever
o pai do meu neném aí
Over 50 Old school RHCP fan here since Out in LA, Police Helicopter, Uplift Mofo, etc. I am glad John is back since he was able to inject some serious love juice when Hillel died. However, I have sought to find solace and pumpin funk from Turnstile live shows since chilis used to have that vibe. I have not seen that in their live shows since Mother's Milk. I hope they come back w some speed funk instead of this slow under the bridge crap.
Will Farrel does an amazing job on drums go Will!!
I've watched it and listened to it more than 100 times already, but still can't stop, how breathtaking it is.❤️ Thank you guys so much, I've been so waiting for the new album,  it's a masterpiece ❤️
Hi from Russia 🇷🇺 you are amazing !
💣
Song is awesome - the haircut isnt
Typical RHCP
🔥🤙🏼😎
WTF!?!?! Why is he doing that strange accent?? Like a mix of irish and pirate
Been waiting since December 2019 for the song post the reunion. It's here, it's here!
will farrell is amazing on the drums
Isnt it great to have the red hot chili peppers back??!! Best band ever....excellent to have the genius that is John Frusciante back where he belongs....❤🎸👏👏
Looking forward to listen to a full album
Another great song by these guys!!
Beautiful music and consistent character. by the way, looks like I saw Eddie Guerrero.
Chilly Pepper's here they are🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
0:48 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

This song reminded me why I always like Red Hot Chili Peppers, it's nice that nothing has changed in that time.
The first tunes and I'm already in love....
Why does he sound straight outta Ireland on the verses ?
Tornati!!!!!!!!!!!!!

White winter

Very pooey! But no doubt their new single / album will sell.
This sounds like it should be a song suited for Peaky blinders
That nuance that john brings to RHCP is unparalleled
🔥 still fire
OTIMO SOM !!!  fico feliz em ver Jonh na banda e que som incrível voltando a verdadeira essência do RHCP
So happy to see that keep Will Ferrell in the band, 🙃🤩🥁☮🍀✨✨

Why Anthonys name on Epstein islands manifest ???
Que Rico género para ser 2022
🤘🏻2022
I wonder why they cut out the drum fill at 3:24 🤔
at x1.25 is a good song
É o trem
It's cool to read that everyone is enthusiastic. I want to be as well but, honestly, I cannot get past the autotune voice... Right now I feel like they are copying themselves, with added autotune... I loved everything they did until about 2003, with By the Way being my favourite album of theirs. I did not really follow anymore after that, only know the singles from Stadium Arcadium. Have they used autotune this heavily before in the last 17 years? I guess most people's ears are used to autotune sound. I am not at all. I've listened to a lot of new music in the past 20 years, but nothing with heavy autotune use - it just irritates me a lot. Perhaps it's not even autotune, but they definitely messed around with his voice. All in all, I have to get used to the production. I love a lot of Rick Rubin-produced records. With some I have some issues though, actually. But hey, I'll give the album a try when it's released. If I like it, I'll check out the 17 years I missed as well. I really do hope that I will like it. They are old heroes, after all :)  If I'm not happy with it, I'll write an old-fashioned letter to the band, suggesting they let John control the whole production for the next album ;)
Why is he singing like he's from tractor 🚜 land in the UK 😆... Good tune though
😍🖤🔥
良い意味で変わらないね、新曲なのに懐かしさを感じる。👍
As always... impeccable.

Esto si que es musica!!!!! Aguante Red Hot Chili Peppers !!!!!
The real music is back.. RHCP the legends are back..
Aww yeah!! 🌶😍🤘🤘
It’s like a satire but not on purpose, and with a really good drummer.
💫 🌟 ⭐️ ✨
Welcome back John Frusciante.
Tune correction is killing the soul of good music. I try to accept it but I can't not hear it
El regreso de Frusciante, alma de Slovak.
Good son! I feel Californication vibes!
Magnífico

They've always had groovy songs, I've just never liked the lyrics. Never connected with them because they never made sense to me. But another great groove.
Looks like a fn clown tho.  But at least the Tiger King's voice still works /shrug
another banger, thanks
GET IT ON ♥️
Frusciante is back!!
Omg, be still my heart 💜 Love this! 🎸🎶❤️
❤️🌶️

Yes,yes, yessss, excelent, excelent, excelent, I am happy for this comeback, I have been praying and waiting for this greatest music, thanks, you R.H.CH.P made my day 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
RHCP : BLACK SUMMER  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Gracias por volver!!!
Oh very nic...,so good to see JF back and here that gorgeous sound of everyone back in synch
The first
welcome back, john!
Hope I’m not the only one that feels that this song has very very strong summer vibes? But I’m just glad RHCP are baaaack!
❤❤❤❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤩
Here I was thinking this might be a Danzig cover :P

came out on my birthday lol I feel special
Los RHCP son unas maquinas, no paran de sacar temazos
What a bunch of old washed up farts....
Johnn is forevee
💣💪🏻
In 2022, we'll be back RHCP
Pay attention to the lyrics and video. They're telling us something. Look into the sun cycles. This isn't 'entertainment', it's disclosure. That's what they do. Symbolism in EVERYTHING.
What a banger!
I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band. I’m so happy John is back in the band.
I still love you red hot chili peppers 🌶 ♥ 🌶
Why is this the top comment after so many years….
Great song and Great Solo
Estos siiiiiiiiii son los RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS que amamos 😍😍❤️❤️ nooo la sombra de años anteriores

John being back in the band is the perfect timeline
Amazing, amazing, amazing 1000x amazing
They finally got Keanu Reeves on the band. Kudos!

It amazes me that it doesnt matter on the album, song, decade, as long as these 4 are together.. you can always feel that old school RHCP vibe
La fórmula perfecta...gracias jhon

Lovely Volume
Even his voice is still the same.
Lenda e sempre uma lenda

Stadium Arcadium del futuro, jajaja qué locura. Siempre nos sorprenden los Red Hot. Que alegría.

RCHP is backkkk and i could not be happier!!
Can’t say fan of mustachio look
Is it just me or is Anthony Kiedis looking more and more like Zappa? Btw, great to hear John Frusciante again!
Legends
❤️❤️❤️
Is so good 🔥
RHCP lives for ever :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I have now a reason to buy another electric guitar for celebrating new album :X
Imagine the opposite that Anthony is sitting on Flea's neck lol
No one's gonna ask why Anthony sounds like a pirate?
meu deus do céu, to viciado, que puta som bom, a volta do John já não era hora
Décevant
RHCP forever ❤️

Кидис - молодчага, роскошно выглядит для своих 115ти! Впрочем, давно известно, миллионщиком быть особенно хорошо - знай-себе отжирай чистейшие наркотики, занимайся физкультуркой, а главное - облизывай сладких дев посвежей! :))
I can’t stop listening to the song this is so good
John's guitar sound unmistakable.... completes their sound...
amazing how Anthony's voice sounds so powerful after all this years!! sounds exactly like the BSSM times!
Dad bod…
Quem estava no Rock in Rio 2017 deixa o like 🤟
John, man...
Retorno dos caras muito bom mesmo e ainda mais com essa batera do Californication showwwww
Que ótimo retorno! Aguardando o novo álbum..
It crazy see John never change
LOVE LOVE RHCP!
John Frusciante anos luz a frente da humanidade!!! Genial
❤️🙏❤️
RED HOT CARALHO PUTA QUE PARIU
Los amooooooo♥️♥️♥️
WTF is AK doing with his voice? The music and singing is classic RHCP but his weird speaking kinda ruins it.
how the Mexican actor el Vítor with his new trend in Image. oooo what a good track👍👍👍☑️🔟👏👏👏👏👏🤗🤗
🤘🏼🤘🏼🖤
🖤🖤🖤🖤
30 years of suck
Is it a joke ? it's fucking Bullshit.....
I dig it,love the peppers!
uffff les quedó chida
John is back....I can now die happy
Muy estilo RHCP. Excelente cancion!
El solo de guitarra es demasiado bueno
están pegando duro en las radios de mi país 🔥
Like before i listen to it because i know its goood ❤️
It's amazing how much 1/4 really means, I'm sorry for everyone that has had to fill up for Mr. Frusciante, it seems so impossible to fill for him.
i primi anni 70
Nossssaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasenhoraaaaaaaa
Getting bura after a decade but the voice and style still like my childhood. My fav band....m❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Really grrrreat!!!!
Awesome as always. True to the art of music !  Never conforming but producing great music with love and fun 🤩
Dude! They are back! John is back! I hope you come to make a show in Brazil.
Legends
yes! Joe Exotic finally made it in the music business!
So, that sad time has come again, where I see another great band has run out of juice and ruined themselves by pushing out an uninspired, soulless, cheesy, try-hard steamer. What a shame. RIP Chilli Peppers.
最高かよ
I'm suddenly back in high school in 1992. Oh the nostalgia.
As a long time fan to the RHCP, I think this song is kind of generic and basic, and it would be much better if they had bring John but kept Josh in the band, both are great and it would be a true new fase
John is back 💘
Frusciante!!! I'm so glad this line up is back.
Los amo!!
Frusciante's solo brought out some tears from me outta nowhere.. I think it's just been so long I can't believe this is real and it's everything I had hoped, damn. RHCP back together, sounding as legendary as ever. There is an unreal connection between these four. Thank you!
Like the good old dayz
Frusciante is amazing, play with your soul.
I fucking love it
What is with the Irish accent???
INSANE!!!!!!
Goosebumps, just takes me back man, rhcp are timeless
Every time I see Chad now I see Will Ferrel and everytime I see Will Ferrel I see Chad...what a time to be alive.
Fuck Yeah Dood!
Awesome!!!!
Great song! Thanks

This song isn't that great. Especially not great for the Chili Peppers. Kinda expected tho since they've been making watered down remixes of the same song for like 20 years now lol
Our "CAN'T STOP" Cover: https://youtu.be/2ySDLkKCaQw
Essa essência que a banda nunca perdeu e nunca vai perder.
Eddie guerrero looks really well in this
🎸🎤🥁🕶️🔊🎵🎶
"Will Smith never gets old"  John Frusciante: - Hold my beer.
Happy 😭
Amazing... just amazing work from the band that's single handedly pull me into rock music in my youth. Always loved thier sound. Glad they back and better then even
Come back to Perú, please!!! 🇵🇪
RHCP have transcended, they're not even music anymore, rather a path to a greater being.
Thank you for the good music.♥️
I need this kind of music.thx mates. RHCP forever
wow that sucked ass.and since when is will ferrel their drummer?
I’m glad this band is timeless
Theres a certain magic you can feel when you put this 4 legends together, Anthony, Jhon, Flea and Will Ferrell
Господи, спасибо. Как же вовремя.
Genial, también es divertido venir aquí.❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥

I LOVE THAT OML!
Flop 👎🏻

The boss Frusciante is back!! We welcome you
road to 10 million v1ews for Chili Peppers!
Musica legal, mas n sinto q é algo q eu escutaria com entusiasmo
Excellent! :)
They are absolutely back.. they never let you cold, love the Chilis<3
Welcome back John but miss Josh hope he'll be in the tour too, please come to India ,,, waiting for decades loves and hugs from north eastern India
Will Ferrell was such a good choice for a drummer! ;>
I'm so happy and there's nothing more to say 🥰🥰🥰
Glad to see Will Ferrell got back together with the band. Happy to see him drumming again!
Good tune...complete with a pandemic haircut
With this song, one of the worst bands in existence remains constant.
Stick-on moustache and toupee :)
❤️❤️
This kinda sucks
Nice song!
Como sempre acertam em cheio! Assim como as músicas de lançamento dos álbuns anteriores, não canso de ouvir Black Summer!
What's with the silly accent
Great guitar playing, and as usual, shitty vocals. JF should find a decent band already.
Wowww... Voy caminando, día nublado, escuchando a RHCP, con un cigarrillo😍 ahorita que mas puedo pedir?? Que nunca muera la buena música por favor!!
lol they're so fucking old
Ferrells brother still smashing the drums! 😆
I expected something better
W.o.W amaazeeeeee
Por fin!!!!
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK??? T_T OH MY GOD, I'M SO HAPPY
udah pada tuir2 dah.. sedih liatnya. tp masih asik bawaannya hahahha apa lg si John, kocokannya khas bgt 👍👍👍
I'm having a Frugasm
Good God they're getting old,, unfortunately that means I am too... damn... lol
Novas músicas das minhas bandas antigas é tudo o que eu preciso
Espero muito que o John toque dark necessities e good bye angels, hehe.
The World just needs music like This in 2022.
Hope it isn't a one off song be so good to have the chili peppers back 🌶️
Love it but I can't put my finger on the change in Anthony's voice .... sounds like a pirate on a slight auto tune
Love it when the band gets back together 👌🏻
Mais do mesmo 👎🏽
Jackass new movie, redhot is back, is it 2000's again?
Nice to hear your guys lots of respect from Nepal duduamari gops subba feels again born in this world.
Good stuff as always rhcp
Good a song
omg this is awesome!!  classic peppers!! omg who else just loves FLEA?!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
как же это ахуенно!
幹！年輕聽到我都當爸爸了2022聽還是很屌！
Chillies are back!!!!
かっこいいし、いい声
♥️
I suppose it's ok, not their best song. Was hoping for something mind blowing.
man RHCP Still fucking got it! the fucking guitar riffs are amazing as always!!!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Send me a ticket to your guys show in sf
My brothers! Love you guys Please keep making music John fuckin love you man
You'd think the dude could afford a shirt by now.
like eating one more Big Mac : the same old bullshit
Good music don’t need to be complicated. It just needs to be good.
i’ve been waiting…
John voltou pra banda pra fazer isso?
Welcome back John♥️
Still killing it 🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️
awful!
Frusciante rules!!!
I listen RHCP since i do not even remember myself and the best thing in all of this, that those guys are the only group that i trully love and you guys will always remain in my heart like the best in everything - it always was, it is and it always be!
Ils roulent leurs bosse depuis quand? Début des années 80? Depeche Mode et eux c'est des exemples de longévité.
Hope this is part of a new album.......it would be different to the current music trends...
This is further evidence that without these 4 together making music, it just isn’t RHCP. Having John back feels so right!
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I miss this kind of style of rhcp 😏👌🏼
Am I the only one who thinks that kicking out Josh just because John can’t make up his mind was kinda douchy? I mean, John is great and all, but he has been on and off the Chili Peppers may too many times. They can’t just kick out every new guitarist when John want back in again smh
what guitarist is the John Frusciante!
I do Anthony's hair style a year ago and I look like a tweaker. Anthony does it and looks more like Anthony lol
Mais d msm  horrível uma merda
MELODY sounds exactly like KATIE MELUA - PERFECT CIRCLE from 2008. Smart move because its a nice melody. but well stolen in a way.
Incomparáveis. As lendas da minha infância da minha vida adulta e futuramente da minha velhice🌶️
The Frusc is back!
Ear candy
You’re all mad.
F E L I C I D A D E
YES! Will Ferrell back on the drums!
Oh how I have missed John and his Strat! HUGE thanks and respect to Josh and Dave for stepping up to the plate and bringing their unique talent and sound to such an incredible band during the I’m With You & The Getaway era. I’m so pumped to see these guys live again and for this album to drop in April!
Pô até que enfim né
Look at good ol' Will Ferrell rocking them drums. Good job guys! Missed you
Wer hier is deutsch?!
DAMN ANTHONY IS JACKED
man it february
Johnnnnnn🥰🥰🥰🥰 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
When they haven't posted in years and still doing better than most artist out here
RHCP keep rock alive! Guitar solos, great to hear, this seems to be rare nowadays
FRUSCIANTE!! 😎
MAGIK.
Glad to see Will Ferrell back at drums again😅
Irish accent or what. Strange vocal and it's dated
return of john frusciante 🤘
Nada de excepcional, mais do mesmo... usando a receita de sempre! 👎 E que comece o mi mi mi da geração que conheceu Red Hot esses dias.
Tudo que vem de vocês é lindo ♥ Obrigada pelas canções.
This actually makes me feel something 🖤
El bajo es uffffff
yo 2022 What you gonna do about this? ha?
Meh.
Definitivamente, são os melhores !!!
Still haven’t listened to it it’s on my list of things to do
Meu Deus que música divina é essa 😍🙏💗🌷🙏😍💕
John Frusciante has returned!
Lyrics are extremely basic and uninspiring but jesus the chords are great
the video reminds me of the kung fu panda training scene
So excited to hear what John is cookin up with them
The tone.. man.. the tone.. it's just.. ⚡❤️🍃🌈🌑
I love how the consensus for this song in the YouTube comments has gone from being confused about how stripped back it is and not knowing if we like it or not, to accepting it as being genuinely great. It took a few plays but it finally clicked.
Literally been thinking about how long it's been since I've heard new RHCP music so I'm so excited
thank you guys for coming back in my life in such a hard time. I feel alive listening you. sorry for my french😅 love you so much from Kazakhstan
🥺❤️ forever ❤️
Thanks for nineties back!!!
The lead singer looks like an adult sized moustached actor who played Greg Heffley in Diary of a Wimpy Kid.... I do like the Chilli Peppers, saw them live at Leeds festival many moons ago, and they were ace!!
Good song, like it!
Omg Mike you would have loved this  Rip Michael ray skinner jr.  10/21/83-05/14/21 Fentanyl overdose killed my husband
I just can't believe I'm seeing THIS stratocaster again.
Is that Frusciante!? Damn, I didn't even know that he's back
Anthony Kiedis is gradually morphing into Iggy Pop.
I'm glad Will Ferrell decided to join The chilli peppers again.
<333333
One Word: Rad!
I'm so fucking happy, they're back!!!!!!!!
John. The Prodigal Son returns. Bring. It. On.
Definitely the best song I've heard over these years. Thank you RHCP for bringing out the outstanding music for everyone.
this is dope! time flew back!
Trilha sonora para filme chinês ficou estranho o que salvou batida igual californiacation
perfeitos como sempre, muy foda

Not another and another black underwear... (?)
Gold times are back.

nunca perdem a essência da banda...
Legendarios
Light,S sound!! 🦋✨
VOLVIEROOOONNN, LOS AMOOO AAAAAAAAAAAA
They Back !!!
Come to Brazil, please!
Red Hot Chili Peppers are still one of the best bands out there!  Saw them live way back when I was 16 with The Flaming Lips opening for them.   One of the best concerts I've been to and I've been to ZZ Top, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Kid Rock...
I literally cried tears of joy watching them come together at the end of the video, real music is far and few these days, it restores faith in humanity to see these guys havent lost their artistic touch
レッチリ最高💕
Fucking love you guys
2.25 million views a day average since it came out
Los años son notorios en la banda, sin embargo, suenan frescos como en el primer disco, Que será de nuestras vidas cuando RHCP deje de hacer música ?
sorry but i dont think these addicts can make a come back.  they should just lay low with dignity now.
Will Ferrell still kicking ass in the drums...
You are amazing ❤❤❤❤
Masterpiece!!!!
Топчік
Meu Desussssssssssssssssss voltaram com o pé direito
This song made me want to listen every other songs of theirs. I want them to remain the same.
It's like dream listing to red hot chilli pepperssss after long time
Will Ferrell is such a bad ass drummer lol
Wow!
9.365.192 million of views in 4 days
RHCP nadie entiende lo que significan en mi vida, los llevo en la sangre y en la piel. El día que los vi en vivo fue el día más feliz de mi vida y la alegría que sentí es indescriptible. Vivo esperando este momento desde que frusciante se fue y con los rumores del nuevo álbum a la vuelta de la esquina crei que iba a ser para el 2023, pero un día me levanto y me alegran la vida con esta maravilla 🤩
Woww...keren 👍🇮🇩
I've heard some dumb lyrics in my time, but then I listened to this track and realised worse was indeed possible.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
9.3 million views already in just over 4 days 😁   This song grows and grows on me....loving it so much.  So glad to have John back again.  Big thanks to Josh and Dave also for filling the void.  Loved this band since 1989 as a 10 year old.....my first ever concert 😁  Hope they get another no.1 hit on the alternative rock charts, their last last 7 albums have all produced no.1s. 🎸
Wow me encanta
Thank God they never change
Please shave that mustache
I’m so happy to see you guys together, all the expectations are justified! The tunes are awesome and the vibes are blissful as always! The goosebumps are all over me! Can’t wait for the concert in London! Sending you the love from Bulgaria!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
thanks for this! just for my bithday! saludos from patagonia argentina !
boring song ,luvs
Hairdresser: "So what will it be?"  A.K.: "Something exotic. Joe Exotic."
Good to see Will Ferrell playing the drums again
🌶🔥
Big Dick song...
Kobra Kai!
Band fav dr jaman msh pacaran sm suami,menikah ,punya anak dan sekarang suami sudah RIP...banyak kenangan,sedih kalau mengingatnya krn kita punya selera musik yg sama
Wow, never thought that they'll be back
this band makes me feel electrical
Por que el buen rock se dejó ganar de esa porquería de regueton
Damn I love Skinny Pete as the new vocalist.
Tells me nothing, to be honest.
Nice!
Jizzz still amazing 👏
Nice mustache
escuta essa musica me deu um extase tao grande que fiquei com os cabelos do braço arrepiados por 3:53 , escuta red hot e muito bom ajuda esquece dos momentos dificeis que passamos e pode meditar com a sonoridade dessa banda e muito bom
La melodía me transportó a Under the Bridge fusionado con Road Trippin. Excelente canción. RHCP llevan casi 40 años de vida musical y con esta canción parecen que están renovando la música.
Can we all just enjoy how amazing John looks after all these years. 😌 so happy these guys are healthy and together again.
Que música maravilhosa  BR curtindo também
Beautiful vibe this song ! Long Life RHCP ...
Anothny looks like a guy you wouldn't want around kids! John and Will still look like themselfs! I mean come Anothny grow your hair back!
siguen siendo los numero uno.
John Frusciante : I'l be back

Peace and Love All
What the hell🤘🏻 ich dachte die Band hat aufgehört 😶
Makes me so happy seeing these four guys back together !!! RHCP love <3
Gracias por tanto RHCP . Saludos desde Chile🇨🇱
He's pronouncing words really differently to how he normally does. Is nobody else hearing it? Strange.
Wow! This has an amazing Aimee Mann quality to it and I'm living for it!
They back.. Awesome.. Still no dislike..  My memories so full now..
Funnily enough I was learning this beat on the drums the day this was released. Heard it on the radio today and was like wtf XD <3
This feels like 1999 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I dont know man its kinda weird, the more i stare at anthony the more of resemblance between him and jon bernthal!! Its krayzzzyy man!!
The guitar sound has back!
Always COOL! John is the only great fit! And that Will Ferrell guy is a pretty good drummer!
I smiled when I saw John playing guitar for the first time in this video.
Усы :-)
redhot e frusciante combinam muito
やっぱレッチリ好きだわ
Good to see John Frusciante again, awesome tune🎶
It's been a while, old friend.
This guitar solo!
nice to see again jhon frusciante❤❤❤
My mum used to put me to bed when I was 4 or 5 with the chilli’s album ‘Blood Sugar Sex magic’. (It was exactly what I needed for peace, apparently) I found this out around 15 years ago and the whole time before wondered why  I’ve avidly followed them ever since I was tiny. It’s almost like I didn’t have a choice.!  Huge love ❤️  (P.s. Guns n roses ‘Appetite for Destruction’ was another)  I was an awesome child!! 😎🤜🏻🤛🏻😂👍🏻
John motherfucking Frusciante
RHCPs are BACK!!
Fuck yeah ! 😎 Welcome back my old friends
masterpiece
OH yea! finally the Chili's are back
You have no idea how long have I waited for this to happen, thank you RHCP!
still nice music, but boy get a shave or let it grow all over 😘
seems like I'm fourteen again🖤
They never get old. They never age. They never get boring. Red Hot Chili Peppers are the living embodiment of immortal magic
Querían música de verdad? Aca la tienen
Время ни щадит никого,стареют перцы,но сонг вери бьюитифул!
A nostalgia dessa voz chega arrepiar ❤️
Stay!!!
ระดับตำนาน
Un re placer me da escuchar a el grande de jhon frusciante 👏
This Band, along with Pearl jam the Foo Fighters and a few other bands, is the light among the same-sounding bands these days
Awesome to have John back. RHCP!!!🤟🏻🤟🏻
mon dieu...... sacré coup d'vieux !!
Lyrics A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting
Back to the roots - finally! Brilliant simple but very effective song!
i cannot Fucking wait for this Album to drop, best group of musicians our generation was lucky enough to experience.... Class as ....... bring it on fellahs, fuck yeeeeaaah!!!!  O really hope they induce John F into the rock and roll hall of fame cos its not fair in my opinion that the other fill in guitarist got in when he had done literally nothing close to Johns work with the guys!!!!! please let that happen
Californi.... oh.... no referencing of california.....
Go way killer 🎸
Hi Anthony ❤️ welcome back
Buenísimo 👏
oh, Red hot is back together in classic set, thats really perfect
The secret for 80s and 90s rockers looking/performing good today is not putting on a ton of weight and staying in shape.  Sammy Hagar is trying really hard to break that theory.
They really doesn't get old, while me.. their fans since highschool already have grey hair & backpain
el johnfru ♥
Oucha... I thought we are in the '90s. It seems like I'm dreaming. This is black summer.
john终于回来了，期待新专辑
Gracias por seguir siendo ustedes!!! Y mantener intacto su estilo!!! Canción 10 de 10!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Thanks guys for still being you!!! And keep your style intact!!! Song 10 of 10!!! 👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤
Frusc is anti aging

Tone point break #keanureeves

존 프루시안테 느낌이 확나네요 레드핫 forever~~

We 80s and 90s kids needed this in 2022
Terrible terrible terrible

One hot minute still my favorite album but would be great to have another mellow album like stadium arcadium
Curtis Mayfield , Jimi Hendrix and even Bob Marley are so happy Jhon is back , it means 20th Century spirit is back again in those 21 first crazy times , Long life real spirit!!!
THE !!! RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.🇷🇺👏👍🤝❤️
How the hell do you hit like on this thing over and over again!
Пепперсы классс
Nice to see these guys together
Will Ferrell is so good at drums
This sound like right off Stadium Arcadium and I'm fine with it.
RHCP na veia💪🇧🇷
Goosebumps!!! Chili peppers are back. Much love from Australia, to everyone. :)
This is awesome
Just as boring as their last few albums.
Flea and Chad Smith both of u still same since 92 😁
Восхитительно !
I did not realize Joe Exotic was in RHCP
4 days 9 milion viewers....that's legend
john is back wtf11111
I temember Times when RhCP where a crazy Funk-Rock Combo with drive and not such a boring Jukebox searching for the next Hit in the same Style...sad
Finnaly 🔥🔥🔥
I just read an article saying Anthony was trying out an Irish accent. I thought it was Chinese. What does it sound like to you? The Rolling Stones of my generation.
OMG.. John is back.. 😁👍 Congratulation RHCP..🎉🎊
3mason scumbags
It's been a loong time...we are waiting...❤️❤️🔥🔥
*Anthony Kiedis sure has that distinct voice that's undeniably RHCP.*
What's up with Anthony's accent?
These guys are old as shit.
i'm so excited for more this is so f*ing good man
Great seeing Will Ferrell back on drums!
What I love more of these, is their innovate but stay the same an these days, that's something w shave to appreciate, because these is to be original. #belikeredhot
This. Song. Makes. No. Sense
John's riffs and vocals, Flea's bass greatness, Anthony shirtless and Chad's drum filling... they are totally back!
They are still popular in 2022. Thats crazy. They are LEGENDS !
John Salvando a pátriam
Menandai kembalinya frusciente
Ммм слабовато ....
Y is he singing with an Irish accent lol
derk side of the mooon
Thank you for bringing back my childhood
FUCK ME!!! RHCP is BACK!!!!!!
it's crazy how they're still active and relevant after all these years. goes to show how good they are at their craft
I sense a 1% scottish accent in there 😄😄😄 and flea never gets old !!! I love you man
Do you guys really like the accent Anthony is doing?
A essência sempre intacta♡
Same dressing style as always john is the best
how is John 50 looking younger than me at 29?
I have listened to this every day since its release. it is a masterpiece.
why there is no text in comms yet?))
Hurra... Kalle Grabowski hat der Krminalität entsagt und singt jetzt bei den Chili Peppers! 🤣
Como é bom ver John Frusciante de volta. Melhor formação!!!
I wish Hillel Slovak was still around. Him and Flea were what RHCP were all about : FUNK ROCK!! Not this boring stuff ...
Will Ferrell still has it!
Excellent.  Just a big smile on my face listening to new Chili's
I cant fully enjoy the song cause it still feels so surreal that John is back
Dave Navarro
The quartet is back in full force. It's fantastic!
Que lindo poder ver de nuevo a john tocando esa guitarra 🥺RHCP for ever
YES THEYRE BACK
👍👌😊
The only band of the 90's that still have its original member on their prime still on the band after all the personal conflict they still create fantastic music real musician at its finest
Real music 🔥
I didn't know Joe Exotic was in a band...
Lead singer jeo exotic with a little gote
til keanu reeves is guitarist for rhcp 🤭
It's a great rhcp song that I've listened to many times since its release. They took it out and put it on the table for those who said, "Dude, is there a band left that still makes the music they used to make?" A recording from the album blood sugar sex magik or californication is so natural that it won't grin, as if frusciante never took a break. it's so beautiful.
Love the song. The guitar solo sounds a bit off and screechy after my first listen though.
Hell yeah.
the moment Chad comes in, he rocks
Today’s music is too much rap  vulgar language and rappers looking like there tennage gangsters looking wacky
Red hot pepper is returned ♥️
Wait, John is back?
RHCP 4ever
I love this band so much
Thank you for spending $20 to make this video. John already looks done 😂
Haven’t listened to them since I like 2010
Wow. Amazing
Wow! Saw them in '89 play at a small club (The Diamond in Toronto) & RHCP haven't changed one bit since. Incredible!
Наконец то!!
Ну, такое...
RHCP FOREVER !!!!!!
Емейзінг !
La entrada de Chad es lo mas!!!
Good to see Will Ferrell back behind the kit :)
You're killing it
Song is too catchy tbh.
Epa, un clon de Diego Verdaguer canta Hard Funk Rock 🤣🤣🤣… Ya en serio, RHCP ya llegó a los cien guitarristas?? 😆😁
this song is very RHCP but something feels off....
I love this song. The getaway was actually one of my favorite peppers albums. I do wish their first single from this new album was one of their fast hard bangers but I’m sure the next single will scratch that itch for me. Can’t wait!
That hit home 🏡
Mortal Kai
Love these guys watching from Zambia..
The more I come back here, the more I fall in love with the song.
John’s back
La Gloria Suprema por los siglos de los siglos para los RHCP! 🇦🇷*️⃣✳️
<3
i thought this was the video for the new "shemala lama dindong put the banana in the apple sauce song"
Frusciante and Flea create musical magic when they play together. Audible euphoria
A voz do cara não mudou nada, perfeição.  Obrigado red rot chili peppers por mais esta obra.
Cool! 👏 Hello from Russia, St.Petersburg! ✌
I love this song with every cell in my being!
Looks kinda like it was shot in one of those LCD Volume thingies they use for The Mandalorian.
i love this guys are my favourite ❤
Boring.
My God Antony is a Buff Dude id be Super Happy to have a Body like he does age 51.
legends are back
A classic sounding Chili Peppers song. So happy they are back to releasing music, it's been too long haha
Sounds like red hot chili peppers.   Nice.
Excellent!!! Welcome back John!
Не могу наслушаться этого блага для души
Great to see John back
Still Flexin'......gotta keep in shape!
Napaka husay walang pagbabago!
Ugh🤮
Wow this MIGHT be the first Red Hot Chilli Pepper Album i buy since. Stadium Arcadium
And the music Gods rejoice...♥️🎸🎵🎶
la gardaş neredesiniz siz.
Endlich ein neues Album 😀
How come nobody is talking about the solo? 🎸 😫
"Sailing on a censor ship", that is genious! :D
No ma que rolotaaaa
DEATH NOTE I love Ｌ
+++++++++
Never know Will Ferrell can drum
YESSSSS nice to hear johns guitar singing
ตำนานที่ยังหายใจ
WOW,JOHNS BACK🤟✌👍👏🤝
Oh fuck yes
Is that Will Ferrel on drums?
John MF frusciante is back yayer 🙂 will have to listen to this song a bit see if it grows on me. I'm a huge fan of rhcp best years Definitely 99-07 stadium Arcadium being epic. Also tunn of b sides during that time were mean as to. Also John's solo stuff is grande for me he's the real voice of the band🤠 Anthony's voice is sounding a bit rough over last 10 years or so. Still an awesome front man though💥. Josh was a good fill in the years John was gone😄 can't wait for the full album own every album on cd and there dvds. Slane castle 04 being the best
eversince chad and will's drum off at fallon's show I can only see will ferrel druming
My heart is full of joy to see John in a new RHCP video again  <3
John's backing vocals/second melody lines are essential. Huge.
Shiiii- Dutch van der Linde out here singing good shit
keren dah kalo ada john ...
Wow Anthony Kiedis Walking Dead style?
I missed John with them very much, so glad that he's back with the band! 😁
meski usia² mereka ta lg muda seperti dahulu tapi karyanya tidak kemakan usia
Bapak Mullet
LOVE
We love you .. all of us.. all the world 🌎 ♥
Foreshadowing  the nuclear summer coming with China and Russia?
Thank You!
Wow...Will Ferell on drums :))))
Who would've thought that this song is year 2022? like there's nothing changed at all. 😭😭 My heartttt!!. 💜
Anthony is the Witcher.
THE DRUMS SOUNDS SO AMAZING THE TUNE IS JUST RIGHT 💚
"China is on the dark side of the moon" its hilarious because its true
Good to know that they are still at their best, when the whole world is at a low.
2:21 solo mistake?
The best band ever....😍😍😍
Keanu Reeves on guitar? ahahah, great song and good return of John
For an album filler track, this would be fine but it’s definitely not lead single material.  That weird fake accent going on really is cringe though. Don’t know what Anthony Kiedis and Rick Rubin were thinking there…
It's very sad to watch them grow old... it's just as sad as watching parents grow old. A very sad song
Panacea❤️
Thank you Josh and welcome back John
greatttttttt
Amazing amazing amazing 😎 john frusciante is back 👍👍👍
60 yo still good music, shirtless and hot.
Keidis slowly morphing into Iggy Pop
You guys always filling our hearts. Thank you and congrats for coming back and back again! 🤩👊🏽🙌🏽✨
I feel like Anthony is an irish man singing us a story about how the world is dying/ending
This is truly cringe worthy, JF is great of course but isn’t enough to save the sinking ship bankrupt of new ideas. AK is just embarrassing, his voice, his lyrics, his haircut and his dance moves are all extremely embarrassing.. Nothing left of the awesome creative weirdo he once was
The intro to me sounds a little like Californication but slower and different version but it has that same vibe throughout the song.
This is the chili peppers I know and love so glad John is back 💪
Like how Frusciante plays guitar while walking on water as Jesus.
What the hell is it with the Platypus??
That Guitar 🎸 = John is a forever genius 🎵🎶
john's riff at the ending is so 'by the way-ish" it made me smile.
As always, Flea's work on every piece of music is amazing. Now listen from minute 3:00 to 3:15. At 3:09 for a millisecond he doesn’t play the first note leaving the bass drum and the crash alone starting the last section of the song, and he repeats this formula all along the last section, it gives space and breathe to the song. An Artist that knows how to use the value of the silence and pause. Outstanding. 👏👏👏
Reminds me of under the bridge and soul to squeeze
Looks like this is set to be the best album since Stadium Arcadium
good to see will ferrell back drumming been too long since step brothers
Hol’ up... I’m out of touch. Did I just see/hear John Frusciante playing with the band?
Red Hot Chili Peppers is back Mr. Frusciante. All the best
Baby baby bay baby love this crazy!  Oh yea yea yea!
Good to see and hear John's back
Oh how i missed Fleas Bass….🙄
I was about to give up on these days music
They never left us ❤️
It is really amazing how multi-talented Will Farrel is.
Video reminded me of the montage scenes with the green screen back drop in the Austin powers movie 🤣
My God, this is like being in a timewarp to much happier times. RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS ARE BACK
We want Chilly Willy!!!
Pure shivers up and down me spine with the phatest goose bumps I've had in a while, and it happened to be stadium arcadiums release the last time I felt this euphoric feeling of love and positive energy flowing through my veins while bursts of dopamine zap through my head. I enjoyed what y'all were doing with Josh but this line up with John is the best fit and everyone knows it cause you feel it so so much when you guys give it away. FUCK YESSSSSSSS..........FUCKING TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT!
Frusciante, the best.
Que grandiosa banda gracias por volver fenómenos y ni que hablar la indiscutible y fantástica guitarra de John
So sad that you won't visit Russia this tour. Anyway, i love you the most guys 😎
jojo bizarre adventure 🗿
So pleased that RHCP came back strong with the return of John, his guitar and harmonies give the peppers their soul.
Peppers sounding like the Peppers!
Still hot. Still chili 🔥
Damn🔥
They stay on! 🥰
<3
Jhon Fruciante's guitar sound is so red hot chili peppers!
Tashi delek.. love from Tibet.. damn u guys back...
Looking forward the 1st of april !!!! I'll be at the stade de France in July to support you. First time for me. When dreams are becoming reality.
They are so good, the music, the lyrics are always awesome, so much creativity. And we all know John's creativity is even more awesome when they play live. I'll see them in concert in France for rhe 1st time this summer, I think I'm gonna cry because of all the emotions they share through their music!
Could you make a (non-pirate) version
just like 25 years ago
John fruscianti is top 5
매운형들 돌아왔구나
Please live while I live. thank you
Been to many shows, but they set the standard almost 20 years ago.
wow yeah!!!! Thank god you're back!!! love you
RHCP have transcended, they're not even music anymore, rather a path to a greater being.
Something magical happens when these 4 come together... Full respect to Josh... he is an amazing musician
Rhcp furever ♡
Frusciante!!!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Great song. 😁👍
I can hear again! Welcome back, John!
🖤
never know aragorn can play guitar so good
1 outta 10
<3
Rhcp in my blood
Will Ferral continues to impress
The shamanic prayer of life is sent from the depths to the gods!
Sounds great! One thing, though. What's with Kiedis's accent in the verses??
#BlackSummer1stwin when?
I like Danzig's version better! It might be a little dirtier but it's much smoother 😉
Yes! RHCP Comeback!!!!
Топ от батянь подъехал. Ждем новый альбом. Это будет мощно
Zzz
damn they r back, ima cry now
Should have kept Josh AND John.
Music to my ears! Chili Peppers so dear to so many of us.
zlatan ibrahimovic
Always happy to see flea dancing with his bass 👌
This is like going to grandma's house and having that meat and potato stew that keeps you full for like a week.
Am i seeing wrong? Somebody tell me that's John. Is it miracle? I'm crying
Classic chilli peppers ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Amigo simplemente red hot chili peppers
not impressed
Todos los que están aquí dios los bendiga
Possibly one of the few bands to keep their shit intact musically throughout the years. Never straying too far so as to make it unrecognizable. 👏👏
Ok this has RHCP signature all over it
Братики, зашибись! Волоса шевелятся...)
the song is great, video sucks, my opinion.
When I listen to this song my soul is at peace.
Welcome back, Funk Rockers !
Still and always will be my absolute favorite band.
🥲❤
This is the kind of music we need especially in this era. Bring back the good old stuff
Anthony hazme tuya 🤍
so happy for this squad
Respect the mustache!
Unfortunately nothing special or outstanding. It's like a mix of all their hits.   Hope the album will be more interesting.
We needed this 🎸🎸🎸🎸 we’ve been waitin’
Josh is a great guitar player, but RHCP only have their special magic with Frusciante present. Great they finally realised it!
Well....it's a song.
On the channel, tracks 	 do high video вид continue to delight us with new videos ✌
That’s a good direction but I need more innovation. I’m going to give her a good thumbs up but I have to think they have to work on this
Are they vaccinated tho?
I've been waiting! For another great summer in Kiev Ukraine 2022!!! Listening your music since 1999 and newer stops! Inspiring and relaxing, always for the good! We all are waiting for you in our country! Great song, and welcome back John! We are waiting for you guitar 🎸
Não acredito, Frusciante é vc???Que do caralho porrraaaaaaaa...
🙌⭐
The legend John has returned 🧎🏽‍♂️🧎🏽‍♂️
John is back 😎
Rhcp freaking Legends 👏
The Red Hots still have baby appeal
How did they convince Keanu Reeves to play with them?
I never realised Keanu Reeves was in RHCP. This guy does everything!

Daaamn ,  flashback to times when no one knew what predictive programming is...
Someone has to tell the Peppers its time to hang up the jock straps, lazy rock song that sounds like everything else on adult radio
That is a bad ass tune
Love these guys.
Просто супер,як завжди❤
Red hot still Chills the Pepper
Gracias.
That unmistakable signature RHCP sound. Oh, how we missed it. Welcome back, John.
I feel like hearing it first time midst 90's
My favorite band of all time
we miss the real artists like red hot chili peppers
Quién dijo que Diego Verdaguer había muerto? Está más vivo que nunca!
wow legends back...
This is straight California vibes head to toe
Wow this is so cool, they got Will Ferrell to play drums!
Bring out more songs now!!!
so is this the first covid inspired song?
Anthony back with the weird dance moves love it
Wow man, wow...this brought me back to when I was in grade school seeing Under the Bridge for the first time on MTV and having my mind blown....TRUE LEGENDS 🤘🏽
Excellently soooooo COOL !!! RHCP always sound so good - great vid !!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE
🍄 🌿 🚬 🤓
That’s the RHCP music I know
I swear, RHCP is like an old friend. You fall out of touch but the love is fresh. ❤️
Солнце у нас красное и дело наше правое. Пошли вы в чёрную ...опу.
The comeback of John F.!
LOVE YOU JOHN.
Oh yeah! 🤘🤘🏽🤘🏽
Volvió Frusciante
Evolucionando
You guys ducking rock 🤘🤘
How the hell is Anthony still so toned?
NO MAMES, QUE ABURRIDO.... saludos 🇲🇽
Greatness yes
Anyone care to give their thoughts as to what the meaning black summer is, pertaining to the bands perspective. I know its subjective an all just curious if sumone had the scoop✌🏼
🖤🖤🖤
John anthony frusciante is back❤
Amigo no puedo creer lo viejo que están, no estoy preparado cuando llegue un momento que ya no puedan sacar canciones, crecí escuchando a este grupo musical gracias a mí hermano y la verdad todas las canciones siempre me parecieron good
0:38 Lenin?
<3
JOHN MF FRUSCIANTE !!! that man is just heavily makes that guitar cry 😭 I remember when I was a kid an read he had left the band it was traumatic I loved Dave Navarro don’t get me wrong but let’s face it, every great RHCP song we know , Johns riffs reinvented🤘🏼
Believe it or not, this might be the most important thing you ever read…  How do you get saved? How do you go to Heaven? What does the Bible say about salvation?  Here’s salvation plain and simple:  All have fallen short of God’s glory and perfect moral standard: all have sinned (Romans 3:23), and just one sin makes us deserving of Hell (James 2:10). I’ve lied, you’ve lied . . pretty simple.  God requires absolute perfection to enter Heaven because He is perfectly holy and righteous. God doesn’t want us to be separated from Him, He loves us and He loves you . . .  the Bible says He is a loving friend who sticks closer than a brother. Would a loving God make salvation difficult? Of course not! What did He do to fix this sin problem? God left Glory in Heaven, manifested Himself in the flesh as a human, Jesus Christ, never once sinned, perfectly fulfilled the law, did not deserve punishment, yet He became OUR sin for US. John the Baptist said about Jesus: “Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” Colossians 2:14 says “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;” And, right before Jesus died, He declared “It is finished!” In other words, the debt of sin  has been paid off in full (past, present, and future sins) by His death on the cross. He finished all of the work, and thus, there is no work for you to do.  Ephesians 2:8-9 says “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that NOT OF YOURSELVES: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” After this, He was buried in a tomb. On the third day, He bodily resurrected from the grave and was seen alive by over 500 people at once and also the disciples and the apostles. Hard for you to believe in the resurrection? Well, these disciples and apostles, like Paul, went on to preach this Gospel, were severely persecuted, and suffered horrific deaths for their faith.  Would they suffer trials and death for a lie?  How do you accept this free gift of salvation and forgiveness of all your sins so that you can be promised everlasting life? Jesus answers this in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” When Jesus spoke to Martha, He said: “ . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that BELIEVETH in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and BELIEVETH in me shall NEVER DIE. Believest thou this?” (John 11:25-26).   Do you notice a common theme here? To be saved, all you must do is believe the Gospel, that the Lord Jesus Christ died for all your sins past, present, and future, was buried, and rose from death on the third day, and trust in that alone for your salvation believing that you can never lose your salvation because Jesus paid it all. The instant you do that, God seals you with the Holy Spirit of Promise and promises you everlasting life. Therefore, since salvation does not depend on your own behaviour or works or commitment to God or maintaining your faith, but depends solely on Jesus’ finished payment for your sin on the cross and defeat of death when He rose from it, you can be 100% sure that you will go to Heaven.  1 John 5:13 says “These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.”  I pray that today is the day of your salvation. Jesus loves you, and I love you too. The book of John and Romans are great places to start in the Bible.  God bless you.  Here are some additional verses:  Acts 16:30-31 “And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”  John 6:28-29 “Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.”  John 6:40 “And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.”  John 5:24 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall  not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.”  Titus 3:5 “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;”
John wick is on guitars amazing!
Starts exactly where Death of Martian ended in Stadium Arcadium. 💗
So happy to see and hesr john again. Rhcp made me love music when i was very young. I would not be whi i am today if i did not discover them  Much love to you guys!
jajaj q buenos q son
It's like the lyrics of the song talks about the pandemic.  "...cremation takes its piece of your supply..,China is on the dark side of the moon..."
I'm into it yo!
John is back motherfuckers !!!!
Glad rhcp back☁️🙆☁️
I’m so happy John is back. The band sounds back to normal again 🙏🏻
God it makes Me so happy to see John with them. Definitely the best version of RHCP no question
Holy crap you guys got old. But your music's still cool.
been waiting
What is he doing with his hands bruh?
mellow still slapps ✌️
Simplemente genial! Una de las mejores bandas is back!!
Will ferrel is such a good drummer lol
One of the very few bands that never has disappointed me with their music! Alwayz perfect! Pepperz for Life! ^v^
Really enjoyed that♥️👍
✊🏼✊🏼
This band hasn't put out a good song since 1995
Truly a testament a band from the 80s still trending and the last of their kind to feature guitar rock (alternative) in the mainstream.
I’m a huge frusciante/RHCP fan, but I’ll have to admit, I don’t like this song 😭
Hello rock 80s and 90s people!!! Im 38! Still rocks!!! LoL
What a vibe aye
☝😎👍 MASTERPIECE
Good tune. Classic Chili Peppers sound. Hints of relevance in the lyrics.
It's amazing how quickly it was swept under the rug that Anthony was on Jeff's flight list... Old perverted junkies...
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
The lighting was really cool at the end.
First, this song is jamming. Secondly, With that mustache, why does Anthony Kiedis look like the bad guy that owned the flower shop in that movie The Town with Ben Affleck?
This is the only song he pronounces his R's and it's refreshing.
It's like I knew the song. If you know what i mean
I never knew Eddie Guererro and John Wick were members of RHCP
Fire 🧡🔥
cool!!... I'm guessing that's the new video walls at the end sequence on the black stage
The solo is great, the song.....egh.
Pure fire. Genius.
- meu coração e meus ouvidos agradecem mais uma vez! 🌶️🙏✝️
Class is permanent..  Thank you RHCP
Восхитительно!
this is fire on mute
como assim eles não falaram de Califórnia???
I'm so proud that they're still active <3
всё ещё в строю) респект!
Can't wait for another classic RHCP album
Papa, is that you? You promised to forsake the sacred kung fu over mama's deathbed! Why papa? Your promise... is broken.
Always good to see Will Ferrell rock out 🙌
Lo hicieron de nuevo.....son unos genios....🤟🏻
Yes! Nice to hear them once again. 💯
Lookin like Charles Manson.
This is the lamest shit I've ever heard, they should be ashamed of themselves, even John, total shit🕊️
The only thing missing was more cowbell from Chad "Ferrell" Smith.
My attention is solid toward the guitarist....familiar...
Suenan como siempre
I like to see pharel william plays drum
From begin to the end got your back .peace out from and old friend + fan ....... and RHCP ROCK ON .
Jesus is back for his 3rd coming
Frusciante' guitar. They needed it. Welcome back!
Is it just me or does this song have a 70s vibe to it? Glad to hear some new stuff
"ตำนานที่ยังมีลมหายใจ" 🙇 🇹🇭
This makes me happy
I’m so happy John is back in the band. I love this band, and I had forgotten just how much. There is something indescribably magical that happens when these 4 make music together. I can’t wait to listen to what they’ve created.
RHCP4ever
He still sounds so clean , I was hoping for some bars Anthony but fine maybe next time....
I know they will come to chile. And i will see them.
The Singer looks like a porn actor from the 70's ^^ Great Song though!

John frusciante the best
Johnny! Amazing to see you back in the group brother!
Mullet FTW
Holdup the music again RHCP STRONG🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️💪🤘
Wow
Nyanyi kek lagi ngopi ya in band nya gk ada beban...fredom...
Es un fenómeno frusciante, orgasmo musical.
Woahhh it's beautiful, I love that. Please give a  luck to McFly and Carlito ♥️
damn they're old
Damn Keanu Reeves on guitar 🎸 !!
ugh never get old rhcp
THE VOICE NEVER GETS OLD💥🗣
https://youtu.be/ImE9c-DKiTo
Still not overly happy with how they treated Josh. I hate that John can basically can come and go as he pleases the guy might be a good guitarist but that feels pretentious as hell. All the same this is a good song.
John frucianti :((((( back after how many years.
Mantap .. band yg selalu menemaniku waktu diperjalanan
Son los mejores
He coming
That first hammer on... you know that John Frusciante flood of magic is coming.
This is a John Frusciante song featuring Anthony, Chad and Flea
simplesmente red hot, isso ta incrível!!!
Shame you are the worst live band in history
The next Iggy Pop
I love this song and still gaves me goosebumps in John's guitar intro that actually makes me get back the respect and love for the band 😍. Of course Tony's voice it's so great and one of the greatest vocalist in this moment, I can't wait to hear the new album 🙌🤘
I saw Anthony Kiedis at Malibu. He’s a joker.
Johnnnnn fruscianteeeee that’s all I care about fuck yeah.
I can't get over the fuzzy caterpillar porn stache he's sporting!
This is literally my new favorite rhcp song. It stayed so true to their unique style. So glad they stuck to their roots with this one
I don't particularly understand this new musical philosophy of the band, because I started delving into the Chilli Peppers discography recently and I'm still obsessed with "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan", "Mother's Milk" and "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". Of course I've known things like "Californication", "Snow", "By The Way", etc etc since I was a kid. But I've only recently become really interested in the band and listening to the albums. I hope one day I can enjoy this song with the same euphoria that takes over my being when I hear "Funky Crime", "Funk Monks", "If You Have To Ask", "Show me Your Soul" (my favorite), etc. etc. I love you RHCP.
Chicos no cambieis nunca Sois maravillosos  Me alegra el regreso de Frusciante
Welcome back Mr Frusciante, it’s always a pleasure to hear the four of you together🙏
Como é majestoso ver 1 clipe como esse; Não sei o que falar, só o que sentir!
Never knew Chuck Norris is a great singer too...
Frusciante  vibes is back
Many years gone, Anthony's form still perfect
Soooo good. That's all. 🤘🏼
Dang they’re back
I CAN DIG IT 🤘🤘🤘
Red hot haciendo obras de arte desde tiempos inmemoriales ❤️
What the fuck is that accent supposed to be?
johnny pls dont leave rhcp again
Am I hearing Kiedis’ voice pitch corrected? He’s using an autotune?
Q buen temazo ya esperaba escuchar una nueva canción de mi banda favorita
good to see will Ferrell after so long
God it’s so good to hear John with the band again. But Jesus those vocals are atrocious.
Frusciante Woow ! 🙌🏻
God no?
What's with Anthony's accent? Sounds like he's trying to be Irish. How does it tie into the song?
¿De vuelta en la jugada? 😎
Love you legend <3
Que felicidade! Finalmente RHCP de verdade de volta... Há mais de dez anos eu espero por isso e desde o final de 2019, especificamente, mais ansiosamente
Anthony is turning into the cab driver from the By the Way video.  In all seriousness, so looking forward to the rest of the album with John back in.
Love it
Joder que buen tema :3
Quem não sentiu a vibe 1999-2006 nessa música é maluco!!! Frusciante é crucial pra identidade da banda.
Worth the wait to see this lineup again God bless them
Man RHCP just never disappoint. You always know exactly what you should expect and you always get it.
Claroooooooooooo
Nada como tenerlos de vuelta❤️
wellcome back favorits,😍
barely 4 days and already 9 million views.    Amazin'
john frusciante killed the guitar
LOVE
i see this song in a movie trailer
God. That drum part is so boring.
musica creada desde el alma por músicos. se les agradece RCHP saludos desde el Ecuador.
Not everything in 2022 is lost. ❤️
Que bueno que John está de vuelta!!
Cool👍👍
0:39 ese es el Camarada Vladimir Ilich Ulianov Lenin???
UGH ITS MAGNIFICENT ♥️💀
I do love the Peppers, but the main talent is the three who play instruments ( Flea, John and Chad.)  Anthony is the face but the other guys should get equal time in their videos and such.  It is a little off putting.
ARGENTINA PRESENTE
John ❤️
John fucking frusciante. That is all.
Música mediana e timbre de guitarra fraco, a melhor performance foi a do Anthony, o clipe faz lembrar o clipe de otherside.
Eh
3/4 of these guys are either almost or are 60, and they're still going this hard.
เม้นไทย from thailand 🇹🇭
Que viagem... Obrigada red hot.
I love the sound and feel of this song, it fits their old look and sound perfectly. Looking forward to the tour!
базар жоқ анау
No meio de tanto lixo musical ainda bem que temos o RHCP pra manter a  qualidade e nos lembrarmos dos bons tempos e ter a certeza que não acabou! Viva Red Hot Chili Peppers! Muito obrigado pela sua obra! 🇧🇷
OKAERINASA!♪ 1:52
Insane
Kiedis alias mi Diego Verdaguer jajaj 😆 (Los que son latinos me entenderán). La neta la raspan chido todavía los RHCP 👌
Waiting live version of mr frusciante
it's so good to see these guys still being goofy and writing music, I love it
AWESOME!!!!
keep going Rhcp keep going ! it's great to see four of you United   and dedicated to your passion. 👍

Qué obra de arte!! Y el solo de john frusciante otra vez en la banda wow…tremendo…
good music
Llegué tarde,  pero Llegué y aquí me quedo 🙌🏻🤘🏻
The music universe is right again... all aligned and beautiful
More than 35 years and sounding better every fckng day!!!
Super
The guitar is the key
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Amazing investment opportunity?
OSP on the ASX. 99% down. Amazing investment opportunity?
Red Hot não deixa o Rock morrer
Rhcp,  keeping rock n roll alive🙏
John out here looking like he"s about to kill 3 people with a pencil
Wait! What's Will Ferrer doing there?!
Yes thank you guys yes, real music is back in 2022!!!
Keanu Reaves is fantastic at guitar
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Loved rhcp since I was 12 first time I heard under the bridge, just as in love now as I've ever been. TRUE AMERICANO
sweet sound but the video is sub-par for a group as recognizable as them.
Frusciante is god!
Foda demais
Will Ferrell still has it!
El sarape de Flea. Awesome!!!
so nice to have john back
Glad that guitar is back in the band
Espectacular. La misma esencia.
Anthony will forget the lyrics on stage
The title for this track is def not PC.  🙄
Yeaaahhhhhhhhh my Jhonny is back...love u all guysss....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Legends 💖
Need more cow bell
Daaaam bro they still dope!!!
Ну наконец то!!!! Это просто потрясающе🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
It's been a long time!🤘
Rhcp really awesome band
I wonder why that one YouTuber hates this band so much
enamorandome nuevamente de rhcp <3
john ya era hora <3
meu Deus que álbum perfeito!!!!! S2
Перцы жарят, рад видеть их в отличной форме и с вернувшимся Фрушанте в составе, всё-таки как его не хватало! Всем русскоязычным поклонникам группы мегареспект!
i love john
Man theyre all getting old, but still got it.
Reminds me of the higher ground clip. Really good song too !
I love it...welcome back JF ❤️ we missed you.
Minha banda! Saudações do Brasil!
Cuando Anthony se quitó la camisa...   Mi diosa interior: ¡Lo sabía!  Pd: Siempre lo hace.   Estar con el pecho cubierto no es su pasión. (Y la mía tampoco) 😏  Pd2: Viejo hermoso.
PERFEITOS!!! AMO ♥️♥️♥️♥️
John Fursciante is back😃!!!
MELHOR BANDA DE ROCK. NÃO MORRE NUNCA ❤️ QUERIA TANTO IR AO SHOW 😓😓😓 TANTO CONHECER TODOS OS INTEGRANTES. OH DEUS. Kkkk
OMG John 😍😍🤩🤩 😭 I’m a guy btw, just so Happy John is back
This a reference from JOJO Stand?
Vaya temon !!! 🤘🌶️🤘🌶️🌶️
Welcome back John. Anthony's neck looks like a coochie
Ojalá q renazca este arte  y q aparezcan los verdaderos artistas con producciones de calidad
Well, if you like the RHCP …this is what they sound like 👋🏼
Hmmm
I feel like with out saying it they deliver the message that you will be okay and you are loved and all is well in the world and to just remain calm and thankful for what you have and not focus on what you don’t have. As well as telling you you can be who ever and what ever you want
Listen
Anthony starting to sound like Gordon Lightfoot 🤔
Damn Will Ferrell is really rocking the shit out of that drum set
Well that was underwhelming... This band has aged like milk.
This is the best RHCP lineup by far. Glad to witness this
True goats 🙏
1:52 - 2:32 BEST PART OF THE SONG
They should call this album paychecks.
LOS, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS DE TODA LA VIDA!  Me gusto mucho las música con Josh, pero este estilo es lo que me hizo escuchar esta banda.
Wonder how long it'll take John to get back to the level where he left off. Will there ever be another Slane Castle live again? Idk hard to say if age will allow them to put a show like that on again. Fingers crossed
💥👊🏻💥
🎸🤘🏼
From Fight like a Brave to this!!! Im in.
🎸🤘🏼
Idk why but I find this video really funny.He just takes his shirt off and then started to dance 🤣.Still sounds really good though.
Me encanta aaaaa:3
Welcome back 🔥
2:07, 2:17, 2:31
Glad it's not just me that's noticing his voice sounds weird. The Prod team used too much autotune for the verses.
Группа"Абиогенез"в"ютубе" и"вк"
flashbacked am i. You are great
Still keeping that classic feel. Love it
still love them
This was boring. I wish people didn't fawn over anything celebrities make. RHCP has made way better music.
Great song ....has a expendables band sound a little
Excelente canción 🤘
Суперові!
Amazing how they always get Will Ferrell to do a cameo on drums 💯
Yes
I like Anthony’s Sparks Bro look.
I can see your efforts..so admirable. thanx for living on this earth.
❤ Let's go!🔥🔥🔥🔥
20 seconds in....so good
En el mejor momento ❤️
From this video, I know it's possible to maintain low body fat at their age.
How did everyone else's summer of 2021 go? Mine was traumatic.
Começaram paeeee s2
My favorite band
Is that will Ferrell on the drums 👀
Sometimes I feel that i just love these guys playing together...whatever they play!!! Loved the song, by the way. PORRA!!! 🤙🏼🌶️❤️🇧🇷
Sounds like something from Stadium Arcadium
Which jam house do you think they made this at?
Often imitated, never replicated Frusciante Peppers baby \m/
excellent song!!
Fruciante is back !!!!
Wth?! how I'm i 3days late🤔 can't wait till August when they come to Miami!! Red Hot for lyfe
I’m just surprised flea is wearing clothes in this lol
Laughable
Love it they are still the chilli peppers.
Bass line lol
Honestly the song is pretty good, but that guitar solo is one the best I've heard in years.
Valió la pena la espera,hermosa canción,esa guitarra por favor!!!! Los cuatro geniales cada uno aportando lo suyo como tiene que ser!!! Gracias por seguir brindando esa maravillosa música.Hermoso el vídeo. Besos desde Argentina
Anthony Kieds não envelhece não?
Why Irish accent?
Крутой трек, ещё не слушал)
Kedias looking and sounding good for 59.
just guys being dudes
I find it repulsive that this isn’t trending number 1 on YouTube compared to everything else ranked higher….
🐍 🔥 🐍 https://youtu.be/WuMLQ1E4iSw
RHCP OMG
No dejo de escucharlos. ¿Cómo pueden ser tan perfectos? 😍
Como siempre transmitiendo todo el power en su musica y buena vibra uuuuh  son los RHCP de nuevoooo
Clasic!!
Weird a.f., but it's the Chili Peppers. I dig it. Frusciante = brilliant.
its so nostalgic, lovely song
You can just tell the guys are so happy to have john back.
Fuaaa min 3:08 me quedo en la cabeza esa melodia.
Electric folk music.  I like it!!!
sou muito fa dessa banda, o nome do meu filho e ANTHONY!
You guys are legendary
youthful souls remind me of skateboarders, keep that young energy and you age well
Adorei eu e meu filho somos muito fãs !❤️🇧🇷
The music is so good, my soul left from world already 😍
It's refreshing to hear a red hot chilli pepper song after all we have been through.  Keep it up guys
We are back bois!👏
Es increíble la paz q te transmite la melodía ... La voz de Anthony... Lo bien q acompaña el bajo ...  😍
Holy shit, is that old Will Ferrell on the Drums? Catalina Wine Mixer is still going strong!
Los amo locamente
Muy buena...
John Wick playing a guitar on a RHCP video…. Awesome!!!
I love how they all wear whatever the heck they want. It reflects them so well lol. Individually they are special. Together they are unexplainable. I’m so thankful the four are back making music.
<3
é os guri denovo
Man.....It's so RHCP!!
They will maybe be The Rolling Stones for our generation
More more more
i was like wtf his look changed and wow great song at the same time.  also i just realised i have been growing up with your music and im turning 34. who mixed the song/album?? sounds great
Anthony is fucking shredded considering that he is basically 60 years old.
QUE LOCURA HERMANOS!!!!
mega lame trash lol
oh fuck....there you are....i have been waiting my friends.....
Suksh
When this band make music I am young forever.
I love you
Man I love it, Red Hot Chili Peppers will never die!!! Awesome.
My Irish ears are crying
Aún lo tienen !!! 🤟
You guys are just the best. Kiedis, Frusciante, Flea and Smith. FTW!
Es mi imaginación o el remate de Chad al 3:34 no suena 🤔
Love Red Hot Chili Peppers
Nice to see Jesus play guitar again.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Suena muy bien 🔥🔥
Love it, I can’t wait to see you live!
The voice is toooooo criiiinge
Why….
Des de ARGENTINA amo está banda de que tengo 11 años y nunca tuve la oportunidad de ir a verlos mi gran sueño antes de morir es ver está banda en vivo gracias por existencia
Glad to hear they are back to their stripped down raw sound. Has a lot to do with John since they can all ride on his chords and unique riffs. Got a bit complicated with extra piano and vocal edits in the production
Why is he doing that stupid ass annoying voice????
\m/
What’s wrong with his voice?
La melodia es muy de los red hot es como muy parecida a otros temas
Frusciante de volta 😁✌🏻
John Frusciante's guitar lines <3
Feels like just yesterday I was banging my head to "Give It Away". The Peppers have been a constant in my life for almost as far back as my memory goes (the band is literally the same age as I am). Never change. And honestly Anthony is in _awesome_ shape.
dab
Will Ferrell is the best drummer of all time.
Its cool. Sound the same as always... All song. Sound the same... All of them
RHCP sounds really can be recognised easily! Good work! Fantastic!
Meu amor pelo RHCP ficou no Blood Sugar... isso aqui é um saco.
Siempre apoyando a los chiles rojos picantes 🌶️🔥🤘🏼
wow their make up is really great,they look like a bunch of old lizard skinned boomers trying to look like they are still in the 80s or 90s rockers.or is that their real look?we got boomer dude with handlebar moustache looking like 80s porno actor,skinhead looking like extra from vampire/demon movie psycho thug complete with gold tooth and dude drummer who looks like every mechanic from the southwest except he just came out from prison after serving 20 years sentence.and we got boomer Keanu reeves lookalike. And the dance moves my god,when he did that Cupid archer move and that hand spinning shyt I nearly fell off my chair,that's some hardcore rock move alright.even bee gees in crotch hugging jeans and chest hair sticking out of v necks in the 70s looks more manly and masculine.  And the music is fantastically boomer as well,u got the signature rhcp melody there and the aerosmith sounding finale at the end,but everything feels so engineered and generic and forgettable,man if they came out with this garbage back in the 90s and 00s it would have gone straight to the bargain bin at kmart.of course today it's   Wow I'm so glad to live in the era of the remakes reboots and boomer comebacks....we got boomer star wars,boomer matrix,boomer guns n roses and boomer red hot chili peppers looking for the last sell out before the brick in the wall hits the dark side of the moon.
Why is Anthony singing with that accent
I can't wait to learn how to play this song!
wow kangen banget nih sama band super keren ini........... your songs never getting old bro
Wow!
It lost its essence
I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I am thrilled John is back, but this song sucks... All things are simultaneously possible
2022 listening people are legend
Awesome sweetness continues to flow…..   Thank you gentlemen.
it's so good to see Jonh in this good resolution
Look at Will Ferrel play the hell out of those drums
RHCP is this generations Rolling Stones. Lol
sudah pada TUA
😍
No more waiting anymore.  No more of this black-summer, this been-a-long-time-since-I-made -a-new-friend, submit-to-the-censors bleakness.  Demand your freedom now, people.  Support the truckers, end all mandates.
Welcome Back John!
It is astonishing that they have been at it this long and are still writing songs like this.
The Guitar Riff make it RHCP more RHCP
*SUPPORT RHCP & GOD FRUSCIANTE ON SPOTIFY!!!*
Epic
When you get these four men to play together.... pure magic occurs. the planets align and the universe glows
Amazing! It is unbelievable the difference that Frusciante makes. It's another band. It's de perfect formation. I love it!
Remember when these dudes were on the flight log to Epstein's kidfuck island?
It’s not Californication or Suck My Kiss or the 30 other songs that just totally kick ass. Its ok. Good seeing John back. They’ll probably do one last really good tour worth seeing. I’m going. Unless I have to show my proof of stupidity. Then fk ‘em.
Welcome back Johnny! Love you man!
Joe Exotic is a great Singer. 🎤🎤
I remember listening to them when I was 13 and recording their songs from the radio with a cassette (lol yeah I'm old) coz my dad couldn't buy me the original ones... One day he gave me the Californication album as a gift, I knew he had to save money from his meals and transport to buy it... So it meant a lot to me, so your music was a good companion of my youth back in the 2000s and one of the first songs I learned to play as a music student was from you guys  I'm 35 yo now and it's so cool(or as Mexicans we say Está poca madre) listening all of you guys still have that sound that takes me back to my younger days. Much love from México City!
'Unlimited love' for you since 1999 ❤🌶
Will Farrell still killing it on the drums.
Altough this is a new song, it just sounds like the classic Peppers from the 90's, mainly because of the spectacular return of John Frusciante,  who brings an old school wave with his unmistakable guitarring. Legends!
As original as ever!
Frusciante se guarda en formol? qué bueno que estos tipos sigan juntos y haciendo música!!! aplausos!!!!!
OH BOY!!!!
Masters of music 🎵
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Noice🤘🏾🔥
saudades dessa banda ❤
Que gran regreso de una banda legendaria, por favor si hacen una gira por Latinoamérica vengan por Perú 🇵🇪🤟 Somos grandes fanáticos de ustedes.
"Don't you hate it when you get a bad haircut the day before shooting a music video?" 😆🤣😆🤣😆
John Wick é o novo guitarrista?🤣🤣
ヒレルもナバロもジョシュもいいギタリストだし大好きだけどジョンフルシアンテのレッチリはso fuck"n spec ialだと アルバムが待ち遠しい❤️
Red Hot Chili Peppers never fails to deliver. New song and I have already played it at least 20 times. Thats why its one of my fav bands.
We all needed this. 😭😭😭❤❤
0:39 flea is my favorite
🤘🌶️Back to Perú🙏🏻 please!
John!!!!!!!!
Listened to this song so often, just so goddamn good
💎
1:47 "Hello Peter"
Kinda bla
RHCP, por siempre!!!
Very telling
PIMENTAS VERMELHAS QUENTES E FORTES! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤❤ You guys are amazing! Great tune!
My school favourites, John is back and for all the right reason’s
Amoooo❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RHCP are as relevant as they’ve ever been. What champions they are
Love to see John back. Really, really dig this song. Poppy but still with an edge. I saw these guys seven times and believe me if you have a chance avail yourself go see the Red Hot Chili Peppers live. One of the very few truly great live rock bands still together today.
Omg I can't believe he is back. Goosebumps 🤯😍
He looks like Justin Long.
Larga vida a los RED HOT !!!!
Kiedis samurai, Flea Jedi, Frusciante neo post grunge and Chad Will Ferrell cosplaying ahahah
This night started with me listening to black metal...now i'm listening to black summer.
Cara, sei lah, ficou uma bosta essa música, ritmo ruim, decepção...
Welcome back, John.
🤘🏼🍺
Dão quantos anos pro John sair da banda de novo? Lol
Ahh the good vibes of RHCP. Welcome back guys, the world has missed your healing music.
Sounds like he's using a strange accent or maybe just testing new inflections
Thank god they’re still playing.  Everyone bow to John.
Venham para o Brasil 🇧🇷
Eddy guerrero
Will Ferrell stays in the pocket on the drums.
Thank God for real Rock and Roll.
It has a Jimi Hendrix feel to it castle of sands
damn will ferrell has come a long way from acting to now drumming.......xD honestly tho this is sick
Goddamn Will Ferrell can drum
Oh, this is band is literally my childhood!
When did keuna reeves join the rhcp?
I like the RHCP but in this video they all look like 70's porn stars.
Check out Flea’s book it’s amazing especially the audio version is narrated by him.
Leyenda Frusciante.
The Essence of Fruciante.
Tqm John Frusciante
I know it started as a joke, but I legitimately can't see the difference between Chad Smith and Will Ferrel anymore
Awesome new song! One of my all time favorite bands.
So traditional keep it up
Finally something good to listen to....uhhhh
John's guitar solo 😍😍
Well....aren't we taking a trip back in time here!
I like it but so confused by the Irish accent. Takes away from the music and bothers me. No reason for it
👑💣😎💣😎💣😎💣😎💣😎👑
🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮
Temon Temazo 🌶🇨🇱🔥

cool guys i like this song has a cool tune
What a swing!!!
Simply a masterpiece
Anthony's dancing has gone downhill but Will Ferrell is still doing great at drums.
I'm glad Needles from Back to the Future and Will Ferrell got the band back together.
Woww, I've listened to this song 30 times a day.🌶🔥🥸🇹🇭
Happy to see theese four together again! You guys come to Brazil soon!
Damn I missed Frusciante. I've had this on loop and keeps getting better.
Perfeição 💓
Mal posso esperar pelo álbum, a música tá do caralho!
Digging it brothers 🤘 glad Frusciante is back, I hope I catch him on stage with you guys. Given his anxieties, I understand. But would be epic. The Music is on another level all together. Much love. Been a fan since early 90”s. Respect & love 🤘

Mmm... Hillel Slovak missed
is that Will Ferral on drums?
Is it me or does Anthony look like Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York?

Well that was forgettable
Amazing!
finally real music once again
God,I needed this. Thank you RHCP
Great job RHCP! The new song is wonderful.
Una de las mejores bandas de todos los tiempos !!! Siempre su sonido es tan Vigente! John fluye como el aire con su estilo propio!
Anthony belongs to Los Bukis with that haircut.
É OS PIMENTA !! RESPEITA !! 🤣
I'm not sure about Anthony's new vocal articulation, but man I'm excited to see the boys putting out new music.   I love Josh dearly, and was lucky to see him live a few years back, but goddamn I am stoked to hear John back on the strings. Unmistakable musicianship, and it sounds like he's as sharp as ever.
Southern California, city of angels, real ones know this hits home 🌞
Es la musica q falta masters
WaaaaO.... I love it 👍
I've been waiting for this?it's not what I expected, I hope the rest of the album will be better!I know you can do better than that!!!
it makes me so happy that frusciante is back, he just adds something to the music that no one else can
Wow! Will Ferrell is a good drummer 👍

I almost forgot to watch this today.
Say what you will about RHCP but they’ve stayed true to their original style while continuing to evolve and mature. And they still rock!!!
Amazing!!! Los amoooo  RHCP legends, iconics
Eargasm

Sdds de um RED HOT. Só não deixa a Anitta descobrir que a Guitarra tá de volta ... eu não aguentaria outra "tentativa ".
I like it good job y'all
This is garbage.... what happened to them...
Can you like, have two guitarrist at a time? Like please? :(
So no one is going to talk about this amazing song writing
Damn take me back again! Or give it to me now haha dudes got same body now for 30 yrs

I cannot wait to see you guys in Vegas  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gracias por seguir existiendo, por seguir regalándonos rock, forever Red Hot Chilli Pepers
This remembered me of Californication🥺😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌹🌹
Much love! ♥️🌶 Still ripped after all these years. (Music, and lyrics)
Deborah Chow? Did they film this in the volume? Cause I love how this music video looks.
same vibes ❤️
Super cool yewwww
I am the same age as this band. My dad used to play bass for cover songs back in the 90s. Brings back memories. Still sounds like 1997...yet renewed.
HE`S BACK
This video should be banned   Obv. Raciast
This is the kind of music that is missing in the current times!
Dieguito Verdaguer
Ilove this! ❤️

the best part about this track is John's tone
おかえりなさい！
🔥🔥🔥🔥
If this is how the band sounds like with Frusciante back, consider me on the hype train.   "Sailing on a censorship" so good.
T.T ....... he vuelto a la vida. Luego de tantos años de muerte.
COME TO BRAZIL !!!! AMAZING !!!!
Can’t believe he was wearing a shirt 🤣
JOHNS BACK LESSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Greta (Thunberg?) Crater? Gretel? Cradle?
1:26 Anthony says "O my gosh, I forgot to take out my shirt"
It's sounds so similar like californication
You are genius. RESPECT
Vamos RHCP..mas picante que  nunca.🔥🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
ของดี
Roloooooon
Frusciante que genial es!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏
Incrivel valeu a pena esperar amo todos os albuns
John Frusciante is in the house
Arthur do tinder desculpa eu dei unmatch ssm querer e to mt triste por ter perdido a oportunidade de falar mais com você:( dammit
The only guy to outdo Anthony is Chris Cornell. They kept things fresh and new while giving a familiar vibe throughout their careers.
0:48 Keanu Reeves ❓
Ant you sound dope I love your new song but get rid of the mustache and cut your hair short on the sides and long on top sorry I could not resist

When did Anthony start using auto-tune? 😥
not bad you should start a band, calling jalapeno or something
So uncharacteristic to actually sing a real SONG but so very unmistakably RHCPs!!!! Lovelove LOVE IT!! Somehow it all just clicks better with John on guitar. I never get enough and never get tired of these guys
Im so happy to see you all together again!! I can't wait to see you perform in my city for the first time <333
🤤 como é bom ver nossos ídolos com novas músicas
Summer of freedom 🤪👀😂😂😂

One of the best songs ever, new song exploding.
Sailing on a censorship ⛵
His voice has adjusted a little bit it's still his voice though really nice I like it different
MORE COWBELL!!!!
3 millones de visitas por dia. RHCP!
The bests!
Crazzzyyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ironic because Anthony Kiedis seems like the typa dude to say “white boy summer”
I don't know Will Farrell was a drummer
This was awful
Liked this song better when it was Skynard doing was I right or wrong 🤔
Hed Hot sempre criado músicas boas como sempre parabéns!!
every song sounds the same
Que bueno ver a John Frusciante de nuevo.
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums once again
Me da gusto estar vivo y presenciar algo algo , RHCP SON GENIALES 😎✌
Wow 🤩😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
um sonho
anthony's vocals never change a bit
I wonder if this was filmed in the “volume” that mandalorian uses
<3
So f...... Nice to see that unmatched chemistry in modern rock back at it again.  John the god damn riff master is back 😍😍😍😍😍
this is terrible
Not impressed :(
John is the best
Great to hear John back in the band, nice song!!!!
JODER COMO LOS AMOOO
Amo ❤ 🤘
10/10 just Amazing!
John frusciante is back....solo amazing
Avergonzante, parece un jingle para una camioneta o algo así... Hicieron la gran Divididos, les pegó el viejazo y el jiponazo... una pena.
Also have to love the fact that they put out a video every time...RHCP for life...great song...😎
The Freddie Mercury look ruined this video for me. WTF Anthony ?!?!?
Just checking in to see if their music still blows ass. Yep.
These guys are in their late 50s and still in great shape, still energetic, still rockin out! This is how i wanna be when im their age
So glad John frusciante is back!  Can’t wait to see them LIVE in Dallas this year! Please let covid disappear so I can see them rock on stage!
I really like Josh and the Peppers they were … and I love the reality of John being back …
Grande Diego Verdaguer!! Siempre te recordaremos 🤭
Que música! Sensação de nostalgia ao ver John . ♥♥♥   Melhor formação! ♥
Damm youtube .. you must warn me before showing such a nuclear bomb drop!
Classic 🔴🔥🌶. Musical identity intact!
I can't think of many bands that have maintained this level of brilliance across 5 different decades.
A timeless band
Since 30 years I'm hear and love your music. This song confirms me why. You have a unique style. Please continue as long as you can. Red Hot Chili Peppers forever.
Welcome back again mr.frusciante 🥂
Todo mundo muito feliz com esse momento. Vivi pra ver vocês juntos de novo. A melhor banda mesmo
BLåQ ShmêR 113. And when they were gone I ordered Ornias to be brought forward, and said to him: "Tell me how you know this;" and he answered: "We demons ascend into the firmament of heaven, and fly about among the stars. And we hear the sentences which go forth upon the souls of men, and forthwith we come, and whether by force of influence, or by fire, or by sword, or by some accident, we veil our act of destruction; and if a man does not die by some untimely disaster or by violence, then we demons transform ourselves in such a way as to appear to men and be worshipped in our human nature."  114. I therefore, having heard this, glorified YAHUAH TSEBAOTH ALUAHYM, and again I questioned the demon/Shedem, saying: "Tell me how ye can ascend into heaven, being demons, and amidst the stars and holy angels intermingle." And he answered: "Just as things are fulfilled in heaven, so also on earth (are fulfilled) the types1 of all of them. For there are principalities, authorities, world-rulers, and we demons fly about in the air; and we hear the voices of the heavenly beings, and survey all the powers. And as having no ground (basis) on which to alight and rest, we lose strength and fall off like leaves from trees. And men seeing us imagine that the stars are falling from heaven. But it is not really so, O king; but we fall because of our weakness, and because we have nowhere anything to lay hold of; and so we fall down like lightnings in the depth of night and suddenly. And we set cities in flames and fire the fields. For the stars have firm foundations in the heavens like the sun and the moon." Testament Of Solomon 1:113-114  11 And the chief of the spirits, SAMMAEL/AZAZEL/SATAN/Mastêmâ, came and said:   "YAHUAH TSEBAOTH ALUAHYM , let some of them remain before me, and let them hearken to my voice, and do all that I shall say unto them;  12 for if some of them are not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on the sons of men;  13 for these are for corruption and leading astray before my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men."  14 And He said:  "LET THE TENTH PART of them remain before him, and let nine parts descend into the place of condemnation."  15 And one of us He commanded that WE should teach Noah all their medicines; for He knew that they would not walk in uprightness, nor strive in righteousness.  16 And we did according to all His words: ALL THE MALIGNANT EVIL ONES WE BOUND IN THE PLACE OF CONDEMNATION, AND A TENTH PART OF THEM WE LEFT THAT THEY MIGHT BE SUBJECT BEFORE SATAN ON THE EARTH. ❌JUBILEES 10:11-16  🎴 SEMYAZZA, according to the rabbinic tradition, is suspended between Heaven and EARTH ALONG WITH Azazel as punishment for having had carnal knowledge of mortal women. He is said to be constantly falling, WITH ONE EYE shut and the other open, to see his plight and suffer the more. It is said that he now hangs, head down, AND IS THE CONSTELLATION OF ORION. - GUSTAV DAVIDSON  - - • Dictionary of Angels
Tsup with Will Ferrel at the drums?
Es increíble la armonía cuando entra la batería, esto tiene el sello RHC
indeed we are FUCKING OUR PLANET UP!  We need a divine intervention and/or FUSION ENERGY!
Mi banda favorita.!! RHCP.!!! 💪👍🏻👏👏👏
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ~🎈
Gracias RHCP!!!!!! nunca me han defraudado... una de mis bandas favoritas!!! Dios les bendiga
LOVE IT!!!! love how timeless you guys areee!!!
Como siempre el buen Frusciante y sus maravillosos solos.
Gracias John Frusciante
Top
Thats why i love Iggy Pop ). He never gets tired. Btw Will Ferrell is good, as always)
Amazing song ....I'm waiting ...thanks 💙
Good to see these guys again! Also stoked that Will Ferrell is still drumming for them!
As soon as I saw John Frusciante I knew it was gonna be an absolute banger aww yeah 👏👏🔥🔥🔥
Vuelven los RHCP y vuelve la alegria! gracias por seguir haciendo música. Los amo por siempre
Wait, the singer is now Machete?
Red Hot no VASCO!!!
Had no idea John was back in the band but as soon as I heard the first few seconds of guitar I knew it was him. This is the band I remember from when I was about 14 or so. That was a few years before Dave joined on guitar. Still nothing matches hearing these guys playing together. Nearly 30 years ago since I first heard this band and they'd already been going 10 years before that!
RHCP 4ever in my heart
2:01 me jogging
That's  what  they  do. ..if you  don't  like  it  fuck  off.
It is always exciting to check out "John is coming back" stuff.
Nice......always the best love it
:D
choreeeeiiiiiiii, Frusciante Monstro como sempre, no lugar que jamais deveria ter saído!
YESSIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Greatest band of all time!
Shit's sounding tight, fellas! Much love!
Es ist wunderschön
I sort of wish they wouldn't have brought John back. I think their previous album was their best album in 10 years or more so why bring back somebody that's left you so many times. Going to be tough for them to top it but this is a good start.
okay john improved wtf
I came here to see if they were from California.
2:51… YES
Thank you John, RHCP without you aren´t the same!!!!
Welcome back.. you all! It's almost strange to feel the same way as I did 15 years ago (and not just after seeing John's iconic "relic" Strat playing again, the one that has been accompaniing him since the Californication era). JF fundamentally defines the sound of RHCP, their timeless melodies are made of his unique emotional input expressed through his guitar and style, his approach resists the short-lived fashions in music. So I hope he's full of strong emotions to spread after the long break. Still I want to support Josh now. His role was a taugh job. It was like wearing Gretzky's 99 jersey, almost everyone expected him to "score" as well as JF would do, which was pretty-little unfair. Anyway, Josh surely found his way not to be forgotten, I'm glad he appeared and made the three bards move (I'm With You/I'm Beside You are just great albums!). Frankly, in music matters, it was Josh who's made RHCP survive for their uncertain future. And so, thank you John for being yourself and for being back, and thank you twice - Josh - for "being with them" in those times of searching for a savior to persist with.🙏
OMG! ART!
❤😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
RED HOT POR SIEMPRE !! NEVER DIE
Rock is alive and these guys are one of the reasons.

Shout out to Josh Klinghofer for helping keep RHCP going during John Fruciante's hiatice. You were better than people give you credit for. Thank you. I won't forget you.
He is back! No other guitar like that.

Esas melodías de Frusciante 🖤
O CLIPE TÊM UMA MISTURA INTERESSANTE DE CORES ENTRE O LARANJA O AZUL E O ROXO GOSTEI DE COMO COMEÇA BAIXA E SUAVE A CANÇÃO E VAI PROGREDINDO NO DECORRER DELA ÓTIMA CANÇÃO O Red HOT CLHILI Peppers  NÃO PERDERAM A MÃO.
sounds like a rhcp song with sea shanty-esque vocals .. I LOVE IT
Named my daughter Charlie because of these guys! Love RHCP
Este momento se llama felicidad :")  Gracias RHCP ❤

Goosebump city.  To see such amazing music from a group of guys who are sober still, really gives hope to us all.  Thank you doesn’t say it enough.
Larga vida a la buena música lml.
Who would have thought that Justin Long would be a perfect replacement for Anthony.
O Brasil é enlouquecido com o Red Hot ! Que maravilha ver esse lançamento!
Will Ferrell is the best drummer!
The weird pronunciation of half of the words he’s singing is distracting.
Awesome….as always, each member performs and weaves the song together with soul. Their music makes you glad to be alive.
Foda como sempre!
Seeing them all together again put a massive smile on my face.
The only one thats aged is Wil Ferrel
Red Hot chili peppers Argentina ❤️
os são fodas  ainda de pé a formaçao original parabens
Perfect
Still in thier zone and own vibe!!!
Amazing how as the years go by Anthony looks more and more like Eddie Guerrero circa 1998.
This picks up where Stadium Arcadium left off.
this is legend and legend is back 😎
*various noises of pleasure*
WELCOME BACK JOHN ♥
Sempre eles amo
❤❤❤❤❤
Will Ferrell is a great Drummer indeed
This new age chili peppers sucks ass, something has changed.

By The Way greatest album ever, this doesnt sound too shabby at first listen
(Puts Anthony Kiedis in a headlock, tries to make him shave the 'tache)
guitar is sounding great as expected from John.. but this song is mid ):
Guitar throughout this song is amazing
nice to hear the band back together
Sounding tight, lads <3

Since last time that he came back, John looks unhappy.

Somebody tell Anthony he's not a sex symbol anymore. But the tune is great!
Obrigado por manterem a essência da banda, continuaram de onde haviam parado!

rhcp, thank you so, so much.
Extraordinarios como siempre que forma de regresa!!!!!!!! Que tema tan increíble con su sello característico me encanto!!! Marcaron mi adolecencia con la buena música de los 90's😍🤩🎸
Love the Will Ferrell batery!
OMG this is so good!
Essa formação é COISA FINA!
It's really a pretty epic tune, it just gets stuck in your head and so damn catchy.
They're back together. I'm happy again.

John still has the Tunes!!! Rock on
Amazing! Still love u tou guys . Keep the good work ❤️
Gracias por  nuevo tema RHCP....
Thank you!
Great songwriters. Horrific musicians. Seen them live several times. School bands holds it together better. And not improving that in 20 years is a mystery to me.
Mais um baita som. Mal posso esperar pelo novo álbum.
So thankful for this
The hype finally reached my heart! I really missed you guys! So glad you made it back ♥️
🤘🏼🇧🇷🆕❤️‍🔥🌶
Has Anthony adopted an Irish accent??! Hmm🤷‍♂️
🌑🌡️
I’m so enlightened by the 🎶 for my 👂 👂s from this beautiful sound as I lay on my bed after a warm shower 🚿 as my skin is still warm ,moist and soft 😌 I’ve been waiting so long for this moment in February, this ♏️ lady is so delighted watching these amazing souls for the ..............🙏🏻💗love💗🙏🏻JOHN LOOKS AMAZING THE BAND IS ROCKIN SO HARD🤘🏻✨🙏🏻💗 It’s Friday & jammin this shit loud.........!!!!!!!!!!!🎼

Great
Just what I needed a good tune to listen to.
ja sou fã a uns 20 anos !
Love love love it
In Germany we don't say: You could have done more with a comeback...   We say: ist so 08/15
Its amazing that Antony's voice hasnt changed at all over the year. And John's vocal is what makes red hot chili as it is
John makes the difference, thanks for the fantastic solo
I watched them some year ago, and It was one of the best concerts of my life. Love this new song.
As a guitar player picking up the chords nicely..very desecration smile/can't stop kind of riff
Boring :(
Que descanse en paz el buen Diego Verdaguer.
Me encanta esa impronta cherokee que le han dado al tema. Good vibes from Argentina!! I hope to come soon! Love!
Guess else get bored by the pandemic and find they way back to studio. Hope the tour goes by Europe 😁. Glad to see mothermilk format back
god i cant wait to hear john on the rest of the album
Listening to this song gives me a feeling of meeting an old friend who was far away, but always close by. It's an indescribable feeling to see the four of them together again, I can't wait to hear the full album. These guys were and continue to be part of my life, they were with me in several moments of it, I hope I can see all this energy live. Thank you for continuing, always. The world is a little better with you here. Hugs from Brazil.
Frusciante, eres un genio ,gracias por todo el aporte que das a la música
Dude Will Ferrell is such a good drummer!
👎
Yohoho and a bottle of rum
I think that klinghoffer and john should have played together... The classic and the new... Maybe, im wrong but it could' ve been amazing
Keidos…wtf is the accent? Not great.. musically still chili-esque
JOHN!!!!
Cool llove❤️
Mds como eu tava com saudades dos meus vovôs 😭❤❤❤❤❤
It would appear that 2022 is the new 1991.  Love it!!
What’s wrong with his voice?
Love the song but if you're 59 years old, just put a shirt on already. We get it you work out and are on testosterone therapy.
Frusciante! 🙏🏽🔥❤️
Muito bom ouvir música nova e boa... Welcome back guys.
Love you!! ❤❤🇵🇹
Geniální song ...
John voltou!!!
Well, I love the guitar work.
This song sounds like unreleased bside from californicatoin
Will Ferrell on drums and Keanu Reeves on guitar, incredible.
Kind of offensive to vikings with that accent.
RHCP legends
Will Ferrell can still kill it on the drums!
Can’t wait for the new album!!
Anthony Kiedis looking like Eddie Guerrero from that amazing mustache! Awesome song. 💯🔥
8M views in just 3 days. .the world sure misses John hahah
John is back baby.
So often I don't like the video that accompanies a song. The video .. But this video really brings forth this song and the band.  Really great.. And a really great song ... wow.   And I can't say I'm a huge Peppers fan. But this song just rocks.   As do many of their songs. But this is so good.
Thanks guys, your music can do so good to a lot of us, we missed you… let’s rock 🤟🏼
This is so good!!  And they all look amazing!!
Audio sama visualnya sumpahhh bikin betah bangettt nonton ulang2
Love it 💯
Everything and anything I could ask from these 4 extremely talented individuals. Welcome back, John. The world needed something fresh but comforting and you guys delivered.
Bro I fucking love this band plz never change
My son has just died at 0:49. Here's his mother writing this one. His last words were "Cleanny it up, John Anthony Motherfucker Frusciante!". Dirty mouth!
Não acredito que o Frusciante ta de volta!! Tou todo arrepiado, o Brasil ama esses caras.
Tiger King sings for RHCP now.
song is pretty good but this music video is absolutely horrendous lol
Wowwww @.@ Red Hot Come Back!!!! #Thank you.
Anyone else getting 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' by the Stooges vibes from this?
Will Ferrel on drums!!!!! Woo woo!!!!
it's john frusciante!!!
Love U ❤🇦🇿🇹🇷
Thank God John Froosh is back. They aren’t close to the same without him. He pushes their capacity for sure.
good ol green screen
Josh should be there
Lead singer = Justin Long from the movie Tusk.
The sound is already nostalgic.
Incrível !!!!! Muito obrigada, salvou meu dia 🇧🇷🥰
woah!
Stadium Arcadium all over again...
The band with John is another level!
Glorious reunion! ♥️💜♥️💜
No que había muerto Diego Verdaguer???
Them boy's still got it...
Esto es perfección 👌
John Wick is killing it on that guitar!
Cordoba, Argentina! Los esperaaaa
sigue siguen  sigueennnn
Este momento de mi vida se llama felicidad!
Other than the birth of my daughter and newborn baby brother, this Quattro of Musicians together makes me feel  alive.  Thank you.
Glad to see Will Ferrel on the drums
Muito obrigado por isso, acompanho desde o começo dos anos 2000 e estava esperando por essa, aquela qualidade e originalidade que só o red tem, saiu em ótima hora!
JOHN!
*DON'T FORGET SUPPORT RHCP & JOHN FRUSCIANTE ON **_SPOTIFY_*
Road to 10M!  Keep stre4ming!
🥵🥵🥵
Awesome! 🤗
cette chanson elle est excellente !!!! j adore !!!
bro they gotta unrelease this
Temardo 🇦🇷
Sounds like Anthony has been been spending time in Newfoundland
Way to go boys! Sounds beautiful
Finally a New song with a good guitar melody, ty john
Yeeeeeeeessssss!! They’re back baby!! I just wanted to jam out to some Chili Peps (like I always do) and what a surprise! New music same feels! Love these guys! 🤘🏽
Thank you. You make me young again... Stay healthy...
Red hot chili peppers are magical beings sent from the heavens to bring us balance,peace and sexiness! I love them beyond the visual.  Flea is so lovely and real.
Apesar de ser nova, ouvir essa música me traz nostalgia! Red Hot é atemporal.🤩 #RHCPforever
the real guitar ' welcome back john
Black Summer's lyric: global warming, pollution, forest fires. The People: I did not understand the lyrics or the video (•~°)
Long live the Chili Peppers!
No lyric video?
I'm sorry, but Anthony doesn't look good. The song is average. Practically any band could've done this. Nothing stands out. Put aside your fandom for a few moments and relisten. You know it to be true.
Não tem como ouvir o jhon voltando e não se emocionar.
Já estava na hora!!! 🤟🇧🇷🇧🇷
Straight banger wouldn’t expect anything less from the RHCP
Great drumming by Will Ferrell
Guitar Keanu Reeves, Singer ben Stiller, Bass Chuck Lidell, Drummer Will Ferrell. This trailer looks like another comedy bomb.
<3
Sama energy Like scare tissue
L' ennesima delizia,grazie!💖💖💖💖
Que locura hermosa
Finally!!! Lets Gooooo!!!
They hired the video editor from fiverr
Clearly making the most of Frusciante’s return here  ❤️
After so many years you are sooooo good. Stay with us many more years
Excelente!!!!!
Literature via poppyphony
Por fin los Red Hot Chili Peppers transpasando todo y llegando a todos. Bienvenido John, esa siempre fue tu casa.
2:35 60yo btw.
Still can't afford shirts
Depois que ouvi a primeira música nunca mais esqueci o Red Hot. Banda fenomenal!!!
Baffled ..... True artists. I hate today's music but this is authenticity at its best.
Yeahhhhhh!!!!
Me and my other half we love Red Hot Chili Pepper, and our baby boy was born on the day this song got released... Which makes it even more special ❤️ When our boy grows up, I hope he adores their music as much as we do, and this can be his song 🙏 Thank you RHCP for still releasing songs and filling our house with great melodies, that make us sing our hearts out 🤘🌶️
I cried when I first watched this. Song and videoclip just perfect!
Love that the Peppers are still the Peppers!!
Sois increíbles
les salto a ellos mismos el copy , que grande warne
This is RHCP's new song but felt like you've heard this already way way back, can't get this outta your head. Feels like I already love the song before it's even released! The RHCP effect!
So gooood, so fckn gooooood.......
Irish pirate song?
Klinghoffer is a solid guitar player, I liked his stuff, but John’s playing is one of the things that makes RHCP sound like RHCP, and it’s so good to hear it again.
Please guys, come to Brasil!
💥💥💥💥💥 This track is on Chilly fire
We missed you John! This is just absolutely phenomenal…thank you all just thank you so much
Simplemente fantástico !! Nunca pierden su estilo 👌👌
Will Ferrell killed it on those drums.
Sounds like he’s telling a Irish folklore
Will Ferell still has it 🥢
thank you john
Not exaggerating when i say that i was brought close to tears when the beat dropped. I actually dropped my slice of pizza...like in a movie or something. Gobsmacked. You guys remain relevant and pure and hip and everything that is amazing about this unique style of music that only RHCP can make. Congrats, guys. You rule.
que temazooo locooooo
So glad John defeated his demons and rejoined the band. They weren’t quite the same without Lord Frusciante on guitar
We missed you John! This is just absolutely phenomenal…thank you all just thank you so much
Anyone going to the concert in September in Charlotte???
Will Ferrell playing drums.
RHCP ability to maintain a similar signature sound while still evolving musically is practically second to none. 39 years and still going strong, and just as relevant as ever. We salute you!
obrigado por continuarem fazendo musica de qualidade depois de todos esses anos, voces foram a primeira banda de rock que eu ouvi e uma das minhas favoritas até hoje!
this is rhcp.
Very good
Grande verdaguer
Finally thanks guys many years are pass but your music is Amazing
Linha de guitarra bem parecidas com Hendrix, principal influencia no JF.
RHCP 4ever!!
🤟🏻😎💨
Amazing!
Diego Verdaguer llegando al cielo xd
Chata a música
A little of real music
<3
If you don’t see the date of the song, you can think it’s an old song , its awsome
RHCP! Os melhores, sempre! ♥️
Brilliant!! Who else is going to see them in London this June?!
John Frusciante
Absolutely incredible cant wait for the rest
ummm okay but this sounds fuckin awesome
Esses caras são bons pra caralh*, que vibe boa. Isso é incrível!
Thank you guys for all the good vibes I hope you guys get turned into vampires so you never stop!!!
Nice to see Will Farrell still got it.
GETTING THOSE CALIFORNICATION VIBES
I'm lovin 'it. 🖤✨
🤘🏽🇧🇷
Ainda existe música boa, taí uma prova, isso é red hot 👏👏👏
8M was only me
That outro guitar riff. Holy shit.
Вы мои хорошие!
Wow! Amazing, and so RHCP! Well done boys!
Outstanding. The intro reminds me of some stoner psychedelic rock
Escuta aí Diegao kkk
Excellent!!!!
VENHAM PARA O BRASIL!!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Anthony looks like a guy who would insist on you calling him Sensei.
John Wick is playing guitar
Muito bom
Papá ha vuelto.
There is something special when frusciante is making music with the rest of the guys in the peppers.
What a rain after decades of drought
Тигидам 🎤
Hardy harr China is trash. Umm duh
Que buena cancion sacaron, me alegra ver que estan activos y ojala se vengan muchas mas igual de buenas, se les quiere :)
This song opened up the flow of my tears that I have been unconsciously  holding back. Thank you✌
No autotune required here folks.
John is aging like a million dollar wine
This is my favorite band in my highschool days so happy they still here entertaining us,LONG LIVE REDHOTCHILLIPEPPERS
Que momento para estar vivo
I love this new song, the one thing I don't understand is Anthony's accent.  It sounds...Irish?
I'm loving that man
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥
Jhon wick in guitars?
This makes Me happy!!! Gives Me a Real smile 😊 thank you
God I love Johns Solo so glad he’s back in the band
Дедули-то могут еще!
crying
Grande Danny Trejo "Machete", ahora de vocalista con los RHCP 👏🏽🙌🏽. Mucho éxito.
I'm just glad RHCP still here.i miss Josh. It's not the same.feels weird.
John is Back !!! 🔥🔥🔥
Will Ferrell killed it, great job!
Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!
Is it me or this song talks about the potential end of life in earth as we knew it?
The Chilli's without John..... Great! The Chilli's with John........  One of the Greats.... 🔥🔥🔥
Have ypu ever seen keanu reaves in this evideo?
Me ha gustado muchísimo 😍😍😍😍🐺🐺🐺🐺
warm joy inside all the people that didn't know till seeing him on screen here, that John is back on the guitar in the band!
God Frusciante is amazing. The RHCP are on another level when he’s in the band
The Song is... okay,but the guitar-work of John F. is exceptional
OMG! I love it!
John are with Keanu Reeves visual
desde q lançou já reassisti umas 100 vezes 😍🌙
You are my Jersey friend
Why is he singing in a new accent?
Unos pedazos de nazi
Mi gran cuarteto de California una vez más reunidos. Después de 16 años de la partida de John, valió sin duda la espera!!! Que increíble sonido, no esperaba menos del gran maestro John Frusciante, se puede notar la disciplina en sus armonías, y su increíble experiencia componiendo música.  Por siempre fan de los RHCP <3
Anthony you´ll always be my crush but please do something about that hair - Beautiful song
the aesthetics of this video are incredible, soothing your eyes while the music sooths your soul. Pure beauty, Thanks Red Hot Chilies!!!!
Good song, good sound. Video horrible as usual 🤣🤣🤣
I need this 4k please.
hey guys just letting you know this sucks
Exactly what I expected after all these years.
🇧🇷 nós aqui do Brasil amamos Red Hot!
Love that they dont follow rules of modern music industry. This is real music I have missed for so long!
Better than ever!!!!
♥️
I bet even josh heard this a thought  Fair play.
damn good to see the peppers are still out there making some good music! keep on rockin my dudes.
I love this song and that John is back in the band, and that the new album is finally coming out, even though it's surely not close to their best single, this song is like a 7-8 out of 10 at best, but they are still going strong after almost 40 years so it's still great to hear something good as this after all those years in music
Frusciante back in RHCP is all I ever wanted.
Tell me you're RHCP without telling me that you're RHCP
This is how California sounds!
If you guys pay attention to the lyrics, this song talks about the times we are living right now
RHCP is insaneee!!! <3
But, exactly, when Anthony Kiedis became an instructor of the H1tl3rjugend? Let him change his hairstyle and shave off his moustache, for God's sake!
music video has way too many cuts, felt dizzy lol
Good music
My soul needs this right now! I need the keidis,frusciante,flea and chad magic to re-light my life force, with gods help 🙏
They have a formula for creating music, mysterious and otherworldly. The new is as beautiful as the old. How do they do it? It doesn't matter.
Para estos malditos años que estamos viviendo es sensacional escucharlos nuevamente
How can u write Songs that good and still look like  u do nothing but work-out Kiedis?
Okay Freddy Mercury
GRACIAS!!!!!!
Dude kinda needs a haircut.
why is it so normal to see AK on a robe walking in a desert
Solo no me he suicidado por una razón, el álbum de los red hot chilli pepper, i love guys.
Einfach nur noch Perfekt
muy buena canción y con un excelente mensaje! no muchos pudieron entender el mensaje pero bue, sigamos sumando v1stas para estos genios.
how can be someone so cool?
My primary criticism is that Anthony's facial hair is the exact same as my ex-step-dad and it makes me uncomfortable.
Love
Love this!  Not a big fan normally, but this is definitely going to make my summer playlist 😁🌄
🔥🔥🔥
i am about as big of fan as there gets, but this video sucks.
como no gustarme este video a mi como tanta gente sus canciones son lo máximo.siempre me evocan un sentimiento de tranquilidad en mi caos personal o una chispa de alegría ❤
Vamos red hot chili peppers el rock nunca muere
Lame
Feels like I'm hearing Stadium Arcadium again for the first time. So good to hear you four
My favourite song so far this year hands down.
I wish they would break out of this "formula" they follow because all their new stuff sounds the same being and is just boring............
as always RHCP,,, 🤘😈
'0'
The Best guitar man
UGH MY GOD, IT IS SO REFRESHING TO SEE JOHN FRUSCIANTE AGAIN
Yeah RHCP is back 🔥🔥🔥
I don’t think I’ve ever been so excited for new music. You guys got me through the pandemic. Thank you, for everything. Welcome back, John. 🌶
Frusciante ist back:)
Welcome John
Will Ferrell shredding the drums 🙌
John frusciante is back!!!
Beautiful
Boring.
OMG ! They're so well conserved and this music's fresh but at the same time I feel like I've known it for ever. 100% RED 100% HOT 200% RHCP
They're timeless. You can put any of their albums at any point in their history and it would still make sense among their contemporaries.
Will Ferrell is a great drummer.
this people sound way to much better when John Frusciante is around
JOHN IS SO GOOD HE IS WHAT THIS BAND NEEDED
Mais um hino pra conta ✅
Everyone sold out, but not RHCP
INCREIBLEEEE
YESSSSS🔥 I've missed this particular group of human beings 💚
The prophecy was foretold!
beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this song <3 when i feel sad i go to youtube comments under any RCHP vidoes and comments warm my heart. cant wait for their show in July!
John is back on guitar? Sold!!
The guitar solo reminds me of outro guitar solo of Halo on fire by Metallica
John is the best🔥🤘
What's with the accent in the verses 🙄
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACKKKKKK PORRAAAAAAA EU AMO VCS EH ISSO
Doesn't sound anything like Red Hot Chili Peppers to me, but Blood Sugar Sex Magic was the last album I brought of theirs.  They've had an entire soft rock career after their original punk-funk start.
Iv missed them so much
Still best.
💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👏👏👏👏
I'm felling so nostalgic
Ahhh hearing Frusciante's backing vocals is nice. ooooo yeah
This was terrible!!!
Boring as fuck since 1996 . God bless Hillel Slovak
Uuuuufff Frusciante!!!
Great song Peppers!! amazing job
Lots of chorus and fuzz what more do you want! Would have been extra sick to keep klinghoffer a part of the band tho
Great as always 😊
Good track! Will Ferrell is on point.
John is red hot master
One of my favorites now. What a legendary band long live Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶
oooooooohh  ennnnfffinnnn !!!!!!
uaaaauuuuuuuuuuuauuuuuau ;D
Ce sont des légendes
brooooo I'm cryiiiinnnn
Fuking amazing! I love
just living on their name now. worst song i have herd comming from RHCP.
S2
you are indelible in time and style! RHCP FOREVER ...It's a pleasure to hear John again
It's really cool seeing Will Pharrell, Keanu Reeves, Borat and Michael Rooker all playing music together!
No puedo decir otra cosa mas que...que bonita canción...=)
I miss the lyrics much, Sirs.  (:
uau
The best band!!!!❤️✨ I love you so much Red Hot Chili Pepers❤️✨
this is amazing! so glad john’s back!! ❤️ rhcp never disappoints! so excited for the album to drop!
Masterpiece
Feels so good to see John back
Anyone else noticed the video editing "drum fail" in 3:24?
Johnny Fru at his best
Can't wait for the new album!
:')
Красавчики
Чума...Пенсионеры Валют..Душевно...
John ❤️
Dude, these guys are better than the beetles and on par with the Doors. People need to appreciate this time!!
Red hot chili peppers, no defrauda nunca, siempre con su propio estilo, viva el Rock por siempre 😎
They've been with me since 1995. Amazing news that they are back. And John Frusciante is with them! Heaven thanks!!!
moçambique big love
RHCP are not RCHP without Frusciante........PERIOD!!!
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Como los extrañaba la ptmre...
Como eu quero esse albom
Will Ferrell is back 8)
when the solo hits in the middle, made all hair just stood up. Incredibly great that guys welcome John this way back)
Nunca canso dessa essência deles
Gracias a mi papá conozco está banda desde muy pequeña y amé su regreso, pinche canción espectacular. 🖤✨
ТОП)ЛЕГЕНДЫ)ОДОБРЯЮ)!!!!😀👍
sensational, that's why I love this band since my adolescence, and please come to Brasil 🇧🇷❤️
We need these people to feel good again
3:08 😍
Rock on !
💪💪💪💪
Diego verdague no a muerto
psychedelia revived! Awesome!
It's like i’m in 2012.. 2 minutes before the end of the lesson, the bell rings and i’m walking home by plugging in my headphones and listening to rhcp on the road :’)
el mejor guitarrista en mi opinion, este tipo no se le va nunca el flow. john frusciante las leyendas nunca mueren
The only guitarist that matters is back,JOHN FRUSCIANTE🎸🎸🎸
It's just proof that we all need a light in our lives. We need make this spark to make this summer bright. Take care guys and enjoy every single day ✌
Flea is an excellent role model
I had a feeling it wasn't gonna be long before Anthony peeled that shirt off
\/\/<>\/\/  this totally caught be off guard! reminds me a bit of the sound (based on this song alone) of my favorite RHCP album....By the Way now there is something to look forward to!
See you in July! Just got my birthday gift. Ticket to the concert in Cologne! ✨✨
Grande nuno xico! tuga na casaaaa crlh
🇨🇳Apocalyptic Vision? 🍟Sense of incapacity?  🦄Treat life as it treats us? Yes, this is a way of understanding what was not created for us. What we have? where will we go? Even so, I'm going to play this song tomorrow on my piano✌️ channel.
Finally the magic the perfect combination!!!! Thank you guys ❤️
👍Like from Russia. SPB+RHCP=❤️
Just saw this came out and was like Fuck Yeah and dropped everything to watch this video. Can't wait for the album to drop.  2022 is going to be a great year!
when did willie nelson join the chilis? lol
De lo mejor 🇨🇴
Why is he singing with an Irish accent?
josh..
Hermoso estar vivo, y poder seguir escuchando canciones nuevas de RHCP!! LOS AMOOO
YEEEESSSSSSSS
Anthony Kiedis when he met Ymir the founder: The video
Excellent! Welcome back guys!!!
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Yes, new Song!!! Love it!!! :)
Parece que estos hombres no envejecen. 🤟
So great again
Is it just me or does it sound like Anthony has been living in Ireland the past 5 years?
Annnnd they're back baby!
but it's winter
Rhcp escuto desde 2000, para mim uma das melhores  bandas de  rock de todos os tempos, se não a melhor.🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
😍🥰🤩❤💕💞💓💗💖💝💕💞 Aspettavo questo momento da sedici fottuti anni.
I like RHCP but I find this boring.
Well done again guys, fantastic.
Freaking awesome!!
I'm a huge fan since 1999 my uncle used to listen a Californication Cassette tape with me. This Band are almost the soundtrack of my life
Isso é mto inédito e nostálgico ao mesmo tempo
This is beautiful
Will Ferrel's killing it on drums
Fuckin awesome
Ehhh its just ok to me.  Nothing great
chad smith looks the same as when i met him in 2007
JOHN FUCKING FRUSCIANTE. YOU "RE AMAZING! ANTHONY KIEDIS YOU IMMORTAL BEING! ALL HAIL! CHAD SMITH FERRELL WHY YOU GOTTA KILL IT EVERY TIME?! FLEA YOU ICONIQ AND Y'KNOW IT!!!
Another smashing RHCP track - and Kiedis looking RIPPED still at 59 years old!
¡John!
It hurts to see them this old. They're still full of energy and creativity but why father time. Let people be young forever. We should stop at 35! Just a rant...RHCP forever ❤
Hehehe perfeito!
Klinghoffer was really good. But John shows you what playing great guitar is really about. He has a bag full of tricks. One of the best ever!
ООО, новая песенка!
You say they're stagnating since Californication? I don't care. This is who they are now and they don't have to prove anything to anyone. And I'm loving this.
The first 3 seconds told me everything. Frusciante is Back.
THAT GREASY SOLO THOUGH GOD DAMN
Been a fan since I was 10, nos Im 30 and still loving it!
Nice Zappa stash, man.
Black hole sun
Fucking great to see them back despite peddling the same repetitive songs for the last 20yr, still love them, still waiting for them to beat Blood Sugar Sex Magik….
Antony is 59 years old. What? What the crap
Anthony ta Velho
Anthony Kiedes was actually a decent looking guy at one point, but its like his goal is to look as corny as possible. 😅😂🤣
Had to think of Flea in Back to the Future as needles hahaha!  Awesome music! The only band I always come back to. ❤️
Props for calling out China, nice to see see some sanity still left in Hollywood!
I didn’t know John Wick can play guitar 😋😋😋🤟🤟🤟
A band which have held court with me for over 25 years, really pleased they are back!
Amazing
Sounds like a b side from stadium arcadium. Unfortunately it's rubbish
Эти ребята похоже никогда не постареют)
amo voces
Спасибо парни!
U2?
Omfg I love you guys. after all these years, I still love you guys.
They've been bringing the same single out for 20 years
Great Song, WEIRD ASS F*KING VIDEO......... Kinda has shades of the Doors. Pretty sure some of the band are flying hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh!
Been loving the chili peppers since I was a youngster. Got a chance to see them live at Woodstock 94 and Bonaroo in 2013 . Both amazing performances. Read Anthony’s book when I was in prison in Michigan in 2020. One of the best groups still at it.
The Nostalgia bruhh!!!!
Pop rock is live !! Thank you RHCP ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
..i wish ....
Feels so good to lose myself in this
simplesmente perfeito, TOP, TOP, TOP !!!
I loved RHCP from the first melody. I'm 30 now and I remixed Black Summer, feeling like working with the Peppers. Enjoy https://youtu.be/qbIuS2yKcKE
RHCP music is like Coca Cola, always the same great taste. Frusciante is just a genius, always making a hymn out of the simple.
Diego verdaguer!!! No que falleció?
Legends!! These guys have been in the zone for 30+ years.
сука время ни кого не щадит!!
Sounds like predictive programming to me.
There's nothing the 2x Champion can't do
Na dobre rzeczy warto czekać.  Teraz tylko koncert 😘
Anthony Kiedis you will be the next Iggy Pop
Hermoso
Welcome back John!!! We missed you!!
Love the song. Anthony really starting to look like that creepy uncle. Love John!
Hands down, the best Keanu Reeves and Will Farrell collaboration.
This is awesome. We missed you , John. Chillipeppers <3
Can't wait for two things.. the rest of this album and when I get to see them live in July!!!
What an appropriate song for this time we're living through. Feels like a cry of hope. Just beautiful, poetic. I've loved the music these four guys make since I was 15. That was almost 18 years ago now and this song gives me the same vibe their songs always have. Can't wait to hear the full album!  Love from SA  🇿🇦🎶✌️
A banda que só envelhece de idade❤️
Is he Irish now?
In this Black Summer we are survivors
*Wake up babe, new RHCP song*
The Autotune is strong in this one.
I'm so glad John is back - you are complete again! I cannot wait for this album!
John Is Fucking Amzaing!! I'm so glad he's back
Yeah! John.F you make me feel happy.
💪❤️
Never thought it would happen, I am so happy they reunited :) Damn I Love it.
Refreshing to see some real music trending for a change
Im from Indonesian like you red hot Chili paper
garbage.  everyone is just afraid to say it.  johns playing is ok though.
So much love ❤️❤️❤️
John Fruiscante is back and everything is fine.
Damn.... perfect
Sou muito fã!! Mas não tive a oportunidade de ver ao vivo ainda!! Ótimo o retorno do Frusciante à banda!!🇧🇷
Good guitar players in music ( RHCP, Linkin Park, etc.) are what separate past generations music to this generations “music” of auto tune, computer effects, and digital emotion, which lacks substance and the ability to feel like we are part of a bigger plan.
Gostei não, toma meu like
Ver esa escena donde están tocando juntos de nuevo me transporto a mi infancia, si así suena Black Summer como sonara el álbum completo!!!!  Que falta hacia Frusciante... <3
Very nice Chad smith rulz 🥁🥁🥁
The greatest band of all time. Few bands can capture the essence of love, life, and spirit like RHCP. They take you on a spiritual and emotional journey with their music that could be the essence of Heavenly music should we be lucky enough to experience such joy after an empty life of mortality and pain.
Welcome back John! This is what we’ve missed 🤟
Que saudade que eu estava de ver vocês quatro juntos novamente !
John is still superb. Really the saving grace of this track. Anthony's vocals just don't quite hit the same way these days. Can't blame him, aging sucks. Flea and Chad still consistent as always.
😎👍
God dammit I've missed john
It’s awesome to see John back in the band he really pushes them to awesomeness!!
Very strong song, great Frusciante solo. Welcome back!
With their success at this age they should look full of life. Dead soulless eyes look isn't original.
🇹🇭Thailand 🇹🇭
La destruccion de China.
🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
🤘🤘
YES
John's solos are the only thing I could bare to listen to here.  And I say this as a lifelong RHCP fan.
I love this song.
Joe exotic? 😂
They still got it
Sou fã. Sempre os melhores. Som incomparável. Por favor venham ao
que dure lo maximo posible
There are two RCHP's:  With John  Without
Nunca sonaron mal They never sounded bad
Apakah Ini  Lagu Single Terbaru?
ya estan viejos pero siguen sonando como jovenes eso es genial, saludos!
Típica canción popera balada de Frusciante de hace más de 15 años. En vez de avanzar y crear arte, buscar nuevas fronteras creativas cómo lo hacían con Josh, vuelven a las canciones comerciales de los 00s.
O timbre de Jonh é algo absurdo... de longe se nota que é ele na guitarra!! Vida longa aos Red Hot!! Espero vocês em Lisboa no verao de 2022!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Bravissimi non mi deludono mai, ansi, gli amo
🤟🏻😎🤙🏻
так себе...
♥♥
No cambian la escencia a traves del Tiempo. lo mejor de la epoca y siguen vigentes.
I still remember the first time i recognize this band when i was just a kid, fell in love in just a second. Anthony's antique voice, John's guitar soul, Flea's marvelous bass, and ofcourse Chad's on point drums. Just wanna say thanks to you guys for still rockin' it after so many time passes. Hope you guys will always enjoying and jamming for a long time. Its amazing how you guys endured your styles, even in these times. What an honor to listen to Red Hot Chilli Peppers, much love
Suena tipo Californication album del 1999 con rolas como Scar tissue u other sida , porcelain wow temazos
It doesn't matter how much time goes by, these guys just get better and better.
New to my ears
Яed Hot Chili Pepers awesome love 4ever best of the best! Hello
sublimeeeeeee!! <3
Hi from Russia cull song 🤘
Que saudade que eu tava dos Solos do Frusciant 🙏🏽...
Thx John
1:04 The colors on the background made me think of Californication for some reason
ESPETACULAR!!
These high quality music just after Fru returns with the boys? Coincidence? I think not!!   He is totally the gel that made it work.
WELCOME TO BACK JOHN FRUSCIANTE!!!
YOU ARE FUCKING AMAZING!!
bonsoir
Anthony is 59!!
Anthony is entering hot grandpa mode.  He's fit and seen some shit.  I love them all together.
FRUSCIANTE EU TE AMO 😭❤😭❤😭❤😭❤😭
Chad Smith sembra mio zio Salvatore
honestly its mid
Great song. Im so proud of all 4. Selfishly, I had a squirrel moment when Anthony flexed his magic biceps. "oh hello"... seemingly the world stood still.  I cant get enough of that. took my breathe way :) -A
You should check the french youtubers Mcfly & Carlito They are big fans of you and want to meet you for the lauch of your album
Essa banda nunca deixa de ser boa!!
Los amo desde siempre y para siempre ❤️🌶
Finally
I love that Daniel Day Lewis has joined the band!!!

🖤🖤🖤
I always forget will ferrell is in this band
all RHCP personnel are old but they are still passionate about music and I really appreciate that
Its alright.....
Seeing the four together again makes me so happy
Goosebumps and tears.. so happy John is back with the band. There is nothing that makes me connect with music like the iconic sound of these four artists ❤
This is red hot chili peppers b*tch€s
Horrible moustache..
Yes, Frusciante is back..!!! The soul is back 🤩
Im ablolutely in love with this masterpiece!
😅 Sailing on a Censorship 🤭
increíble!  suenan como siempre
It's like come back in 1999,libero Californication
Like several mentioned...goosebumps and instant rhcp vibes knowing this album will be going into history! Good stuff guys and so happy you all still kicking ass despite time and age is catching us, luckly this songs still has same good vibe that makes time and memories stop (feels like yesterday when we where young and jamming on you guys music!).
😎🤟
Anyone, original guitar chords of this magnificient song?
Damn, Will Ferrell can really wail on them drums!!
I bet the other guy that played guitar for them is gutted. Poor guy. Just imagine if John had always stayed though
Thanks for what you've been doing all these years! Your music inspires and accompanies me for the last 20 years of my life. Your music is always from the heart and it is beautiful! Thanks for staying true to yourself ❤️
I'm so glad to see Frusciante back on band and see the band with the same essence 10 years later ❤️❤️❤️
🖤🎸🎵🎶
Who else farted and made a better song?
Letssssss go Peppers
Rhcp from indonesia
meh
Come to Brazil Please 🇧🇷 🇧🇷🇧🇷
The  cruelty of time. The passing of the years tempt us to imitate our younger selves. The ugly parody that awaits us all.
🇦🇷
En paz desvanece mi Dieguito Verdaguer
i'm not criying v,:
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
This song gets better and better every time I listen to it 🤘
El último video de Diego Verdaguer antes de morir. Grande DIEGO!
2:53 chills
Does this have to do anything with the zombie TV show called Black Summer?
Will Farrel sounds great on drums
What a sound
Will Farrell is killing on the drums. More cowbell, please!
Another release, another banger, looking forward to seeing you guys on tour, it's gonna be a banger and a half
Damn I'm getting nostalgia 💖💖💖💖I'm reliving my young days with theirs music

TODAVIA HAY ESPERANZA..!!!..TODAVIA HAY EXELENTE MUSICA..!!
Прям глоток свежего воздуха ⚡️🔥
🤩
Will Ferrell back at it!
All I can say is, thank God for John and that ripping solo. Everything else made me fall asleep. Sorry, but I really can't stand the band they've become since Mother's Milk.
Next 1billion views video. 😉
Love how will ferrel is such a good drummer
Esto es posiblemente lo último de ellos.
holly shiet yes.
Just another chance for Anthony to take his shirt off and show everyone his big muscles.  Nothing much else going on.
It' s like meeting  a bunch  of  old friends that I haven't seen in a while  , but  after a couple of minutes it' s like we met the day before. ..
porco cane se sono invecchiati questi ........
los amo. saludos desde argentina
This is some OG red hot
frusciante ptmm cuando mrd dejaras de sorprenderme que buenos solos goood!!!! my master is back!!!!!!!!

Flea on Anthony’s shoulders, Chad killing it on the drums and John making another insane come back. They are BACK!!!
Listened to it on acid more or less surprisedly. And I cried. John, I fucking cried. Thank you!
Frusciante is back
Welcome back Frusciante🤘🤘🤘
With LOVE from Ukraine 🇺🇦  Thanks 💛💙🙏
This band has literally taken me on so many rides of my life from my youth all the way into damn near middle age! Thank you RHCP! Can't wait for the new album!! 🔥🔥🔥
My Fav Band... fleaaaa🤗
Awesome!great to see Chili’s reunited👏 Song is perfect timing for the Freedom Convoy movement! F🇨🇦CK TRUDEAU!
Esta chido el Gabán de Flea.
Esta super sigan adi campeones
Så bra!!!
I never comment on videos, but this time around I feel like I have to ...  I started to play guitar because my cousin who passed away played guitar and was a massive RHCP and Frusciante fan.   Listening and watching this song gave me chills. The RHCP vibe, the solo, the legendary 4.   Thank you from Spain. Looking forward to your concert in Barcelona this summer ♥️
Que hermosa vuelta la del Frusci Red hot en toda su escencia😍❤🤘
Ret por siempre
great song!
not one of their best but still good
Que banda la concha de la.madre miren guachos dejen de escuchar reggaeton !!!!
So good to see and hear John in the band again. I really missed his guitar playing, it just fits the Chili Peppers perfectly and is a great combination with Anthony's voice. Can't wait to hear the whole album.
Average... They can and must do better.
Anthony sounds like an Irishman doing extremely well at sounding like Anthony
They never disappoint. The quality is always amazing. John remains elusive. They improve like wine.
This really has vibes from the last album
Я думал вы уже на пенсию ушли) Молодцы парни!
esta banda no tiene techo,no paran de sacar un hit atras del otro..siempre vigentes en el rock, bienvenido otra vez john 🎸🎶
Iggy Pop and Magnum P.I's love child

It's so cool seeing Will Ferrell on Drums
0:47 John appears, he's finally back after some years, that touched me! 💓
Это хоть слушабельней, чем очередной говноальбом лилзалупы или оксимирона
Perfect just perfecto 👌
Top of The pops
ფურშანტე მტყნელია ფურშანტე მტყნელია

Every song sounds the same.
El vocalista no envejece, increible, que gran banda, grandes recuerdos de mi niñez y adolescencia.
Sdds do que a gente ainda não viveu. Que venha o Amor Ilimitado.
Вот это нежданчик ! вот это подарок !!! спасибо мужики 👍from Russia
Even though it's been a while since they started making music, they haven't changed their style at all!! I may not have been here since the beginning of their career, but I sure am glad I'm here now! I really hope they play this for their upcoming tour!!
Simplemente RHCP 🔥🙌
Shout out to MixedUpEverything who put out an acoustic cover of this song in just a few hours after this release 👊🏼
Fenomenal como sempre, também com Chuck Norris no vocal ninguém pode né kkk
Welcome back lagend
Ver esses malucos juntos novamente e bom demais!!! Vida longa sempre RHCP!!!!
Always in shape Love you  God bless you guys :*
JoJo
Frusciante killed the RHCP when he first came back in 1999 in the cheesy  calfornication album .... Now he's back again to rape the corpse ...
Finally with John back they sound like the chili peppers again!
Will Farrell looking great on the drums
Too soon 4 summer?
Voltamos as origens amém senhor
Will Farrell nailed it again!
Cade os BR representando??
The title is a little on the nose

FUZZ
RHCP is forever in the trend!
Love to see you guys vibing with the same energy than two decades ago, you have no idea how much i loved this freaking song❤️
💟💟💟
no es su mejor cancion pero mantienen vivo el rock
It's like the four of them broke out of demolition man's cryoprison
Как же долго я этого ждал, мурашки…мурашки…мурашки
Awesome! More please 🖤
Will Ferrell looking great as always
Faith no more
Its only 2022 but already best solo of the decade 🎸..
Kiedis lookin like Kill Bill, if he was into Bob 🤙🕺
Зоопарк корявых клоунов.
I haven't listened much to RHCP for a long time, and then this lovely gem just came out of the blue. Refreshing!
I'm so glad john is back
It is an orgasmic… Gob bless RHCP;)
Diego Verdaguer still alive!
Anthony joe exotic kedis Anthony exotic
Music needs this and more right now.   I NEEDED THIS RN!!  I keep thinking I've turned into the grumpy old man who hates all new music but, some artists still out here making real music. Thank you RHCP for your contribution.
Chad está increiblemente viejo
mother of god...masterpiece
I needed this today
Anthony looks like joe exotic
Not bad. But exactly the same. How long can the californication album go on for?
So good
Pizdec
RHCP still up and running! We are back to the atmosphere of Stadium Arcadium. John is finally and clearly back! Nice bass line too. Chad drumming 100% RHCP style....
Ви неймовірні! Дуже радий, що ПЕРЦІ повернулись!! З любов'ю з України ❤️❤️❤️
Recién me di cuenta que estoy muy  viejo
yesssssssssssssssss
Amazing😎😎😎
volvio frusciante!! no sabia :'v
Frusciante ван лав ❤
Que musicão da porra!! RHCP
Obsessed - cannot wait for the new album!
The red hot chilli peppers song.
Red hot chili peppers es el antídoto a todo este caos
COOOOOOLLLLL!!!!!!!!From Russia with love!
welcome back home John.
Nostalgia ❤
They never fail to entertain me! Even with Josh even tho it wasn't the same. I still loved them!
sky refuse to cry  - welcome back. Nice to hear it again
Can you turn the Frusciante up, please?
¿Que hace el Silverio por acá?
Will Ferrell on drums
I remember when I was 13 in 1984 and saw "True men don't kill coyotes."I was a fan since that first song.....! I've been sharing RHCP with people since.
This makes my vibrations so happy. Thank you so much RHCP! My all time favorite band! Can't freaking wait to see you live in Detroit. Been on my bucket list for about 15 years! Wish my mom could be with us to see you💖
Very good sound again the last album sounds meh, not blown away. But this new song very promising. And Dave is back?
Amazing, can't wait for more.
Outstanding return for this guys! Congratulations for staying relevant.
정말 감사합니다 레드핫 시간이 지나도 여러분은 여전히 나에게 최고 그 자체입니다. 건강하세요 사랑합니다👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
How many decades have they been around????I've been a fan since I was 9 thanks to my sis and iam 33 now happy to see them all together and making great fucken music thank you!!!!!!
Ха, а я ещё помню их фото в "Я молоток", когда из одежды на них были только носки. А теперь такие приличные дядьки. И усы. Но музыка по-прежнему супер
So, is no one going to mention that Anthony now looks like Eddie guerrero
First few guitar chords, and you know it's John. His style is unmistakable. Finally some new music from Peppers!🤗♥️💥🎉
💥💥💥💥🔥🔥💥🔥💥🔥🔥💨
red hot chili peppers forever ❤️❤️
👑👑👑👑
Invariant purity. 😘👌🎸
Every time same frusciante vibes ❤️💊
ROCK NOT DEAD
С нетерпением жду новый альбом. Спустя столько лет существования Rhcp истинно преданы своему делу.
What is Will Ferrell doing in this video? :P
No hay nada mas genial q verlos  de nuevo haciendo buena musica con Jhon en la guitarra
Effortlessly plays 🎸 fml
Frusciante!!! :)
Oh THIS FUCKS!
I saw John, I cried
How is it that these guys can release the same song for 35 years and find success while Fishbone is out there starving and making new fresh music every time they drop something?
Surprising out of the box
Love that subtle shanty thing - arrrr…
It tasted like sweet chili to me! I love it, can I have some more!!!
Это оч хорошо...
So glad they're back! :)
A lot of people talking about John's return and I think that's amazing! It's like a return to the past. But I don't ignore the fact that Josh was part of the group. I love them both, each in their own era in the history of RHCP.
Love you John, Love you RHCP
OMG
Did not know Will Ferrell played the drums in Red Hot Chili Peppers ;) lol
Just when u thought they could not get any worse they release this 💩
Why doesn't Viagra help with depression?  It just makes things harder.
Only real hardcore fans will understand what it means to have John back. No disrespect to Josh but if u read their latest interview, Flea will tell that John and him are so musically and naturally tuned to each other.   I Been a fan since was BSSM era.. to have a new album out soon gives fans so much happiness and freedom esp in today’s time.
bonzão vey
I dont think Chad plays drums. They just took the rhythm of californication. If this is their most exciting song they should just quit. How many songs do they still want to release that sound the same? I wonder that they still do the same shit since the album after californication and dont get bored themselves.
Can’t get past the fake accent.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have chili peppers again! ❤️🙏
Red Hot Chilli Peppers в очередной раз доказали что они в хорошей форме как и сам Киддис и могут выпускать хиты. Спасибо вам Перцы, вы навсегда Number one in my heart
*ctrl+f "pirate"*   Come on, guys
Feliz com o John Frusciante de volta. Esse cara tem é o melhor.
So the entire hook of the song is just the solo from the Beatles Hard days night?????
La mejor banda del universo, 2023 los esperamos en Latinoamérica para ver a la formación favorita de todos
Come back and play Lincoln, Nebraska again! Come on boys.........let's go!
best rock band ever
John we've missed u
I never get bored with this 👏🏼 Awesome!
RHCP  will  always remain young  🤟🤟🤟🤟
Love It ~ Shout out to Whacky Jacky
awesome
Good job again guys.
Anthony, you should trim your mustache. 'The horse looks like a butterfly on his dick' does not suit
This just proves that RHCP are nothing without John. What a tune!
Amazing
💚
....Get it on....
New Music! Thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers, so glad you didn't remix your old songs! 🤟
Simply: Awesome 😍
🙏🍀🙏👌👌👌👌👌
The boys are back!!!
Katy Perry & Dua Lipa REMIX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyNJ63yZyHM
What is this a fucking Irish sea shanty?    I love RHCP and have since day one but this song fucking BLOWS!
john frusciante nothing without rhcp, rhcp nothing without john frusciante
Amazing sound, Anthony look like the son of Dany trejo 😂
Welcome back John!
JFCOB!! Frusciante! Best Guitar player alive.   The rest are silly amateurs with their plugins and amp emulators.
Good to see u back, John!!!
Algún colombiano por estos lados ?
I want JOHN back… oh, wait!
Cool John's back..but this song is nothing special
Wow. This band sounds better than ever, proving that if the rock n' roll lifestyle doesn't kill you, it will make you stronger. And after just hearing the pig's ear Halestorm have made of the production on their latest tune, it was like going from the ridiculous to the sublime to have this superlative mix coming out of my headphones - you can hear every band member crystal clear and in perfect harmony - very tight. THIS is how you produce a track! As for the song, it's the "classic lineup" playing classic RHCP, giving the fans exactly what they want to hear - great rock music with that classic funky syncopated tempo. Lots of light and shade, good structure and all four guys sound great. You'll soon be singing along to Anthony Kiedis' profound lyrics, soaring to John Frusciante's guitar and getting down to the superb rhythm section of Flea and Chad Smith. Loved it. My Score: Excellent 5*
Right, my Bro!
Frusciante was so missed!
Please never leave again John!!!
Damn Anthony looks like the offspring of the unholy union between a crackhead Mario bros and Tony Levin. He needs work done ASAP!
John Bernthal with a moustache
4 lendas
Sensational
ROCK OUT MOTHERF*CKERS!!!!!!
Cool Satanist music!
I love rhcp ❤️🔥
Will Ferrell is great on drums!
Red hot Chili Peppers 😍😘😍😘
I think so many are breathing a sigh of relief hearing new RHCP. This is so needed right now and wow, what a great song. As some who's been a fan since Mother's Milk I'm still in awe of their ability to still be so creative, relevant, and give their fans exactly what they love about their music.  Phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal!
Best come back ever, frusciante is John wick - Flea is a sunset rider character , Chad is there showing his ímpetu - and Anthony fuck you and thank you for absorbing all the culture and power that earth , music and love have for us guys. I have a band it's name is Overfunk,  we are not famous but we are happy to see that you are trying to save music as much as we would love to do In a future. Thank you for this
the prodigal son returns
Long time no see guys.... yeah I've been waiting.
Los. Mejores!! saludos desde Perú, esperándolos con ansias 🇵🇪
The drummer looks like will ferrell
Caraaaaaalho o jonh voltou

Miss my old days 🥺
Miss hearing John Frusciante play
desecretion smile pt. 2 <3
Boa música adoro chillis Peppers mas velhos mas oesmo carisma da banda na brs aqui em 2022
YYYYEAAAAAAHHHHH Babeeyyy ROCK ON  <3 LOVE IT !
Oh John, you beautiful soul.
No offense to josh he's dope but I lost my shit whenever I saw frusciante , especially whenever hear that solo kicks in and just you see John just playing effortlessly . It gave goosebumps. It was like watching like watching them perform live again but in a song, talk about amazing.  It so dope to see
Didn't know Frusciante back 👍👍👍 Super song!
Increíble que aún mantengan su sonido
Amazing, just amazing, John is back on RCHP I’m melting away ❤️❤️❤️
Didn’t know Will Ferrell played drums
it seems like they are in a good shape! Welcome back Peppers!
John frusciante ❤
RHCP always sounds better when Frusciante is on board
Maravilhosos! Nem acreditei quando eu vi, voltei a minha infância. ♥️
Wow ❤️ I've been waiting . Jhon F ..
Amazing song guys! Thanks Josh for your amazing job with these guys, let's hope John knows what he's doing and not quit the band again, he's brilliant
Mais ou menos..
Best!!!!!
3:14 thought that was will ferrell not chad
I thought that was Will Ferrell on the drums at first lol
MUSE dropped a great a few weeks ago, now the RHCP dropped another perfect album, damn bro it couldn't be better than this.
Mantienen el toque
nice. love it.
John is baaaaaack! Fuuuuck yeah!
Yes, Frusciante! Make love to my earholes 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
One of my all time fav bands....you guys are timeless! Rock on!
They're back!
Buenisimo como siempre
I tell you what... Will Ferrell  is ageless!  😉
Somebody made a comment about John being on a fuzz pedal on the song it's not a fuzz pedal the pedal is called small stones it's a totally different sounds it's not a fuzzbox
Not much new here.
the song's not bad, but what's with the irish accent, anthony?
its so nice to see frusciante again
I tear came out the moment i saw frusciante!!
I feel like I’ve been dropped into my high school years. This doesn’t feel old, it feels familiar. I love it
Strong start! After the last couple of albums, it was looking pretty bleak. I guess that's what you get when the Froosh comes back up. Looking forward to the meat of the album now. Hopefully some funkiness for real. Hopefully Chad bringing more of his real drumming back too (i.e. last seen in Chickenfoot).
Loving these guys to death loving these guys to death I'm sure the album will be is total successful to Stadium Arcadium and if it is I will definitely do an Easton promotion for them again as I did back in 09 good luck guys it's not like you're going to need it I am so happy for you guys and your fans it will be a beautiful summer falling in love again with your music
Legend!!!
John Frusciante welcome back Sir 😊
What a terrible band they've become lol
This is soooooo good 👍 👏 👌
John gives me goosebumps ❤❤❤❤. I love that they are back together.
ALWAYS LEGENDARY
Eu não acredito que troquei o show do Red hot por uma tatuagem em 2002 Que merda que fiz!!!! E a tatuagem ficou uma merda kkkkk
Why does it sound like straight out of a COEN BROTHERS movie? 😂
I love rchp, I get older, they stay the same age!

I see Will Ferral got the job.... Great tune! Glad ya back. 🥳
John is back

7.7 million views in 72 hours. Not bad. Welcome back John Frusciante.
Shamalama ding dong - all I can say
4人とも年々、達人とか師匠っぽくなってて笑える
The black summer has ended guys, john is back, PLEASE come to the majestic marvelous country of the summer, COME TO BRAZIL!!!
Old but always gold.... Keep ur legacy on!!! Great music...
John Frusciante was the glue that kept RHCP together.  They're officially back, and stronger like before.
Sox On Cox v2.0 plsplsplspls
I actually like their new song 🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSSSS
RHCP legends
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
ya se nos ponen viejos :(
This Band never get old haha
Sounds like a By The Way or Stadium Arcadium b-side. Bland and uninspired.
Grande red Hot Chili peppers 🖤🎧
Ada yang nunggu-nunggu ini nggak dari indo?
This sounds wayyyyyy too good man. Respect from the bottom of my heart for keeping your feeling intact after all these years.
Ooh it's a stinker. Hope they haven't rushed the album.
Love u guys ❤️‍🔥🤘🤘🤘
The greatest,and got their missing peice back,nobody does it better then john
Holy shit this was really good. I'm genuinely surprised and humbled.
No one else can be the RHCP guitarist. There's only one. ❤️ WELCOME BACK, JOHN ❤️
The Chili Peppers ain’t the same without Frusciante. His guitar playing is stellar to say the least. Glad he’s back.
I’m getting serious Frank Zappa vibes from Keidis.  Also no disrespect but it’s truly RHCP when Frusciante’s involved.  That tone is unequivocally distinctive.
Yes !! John is back!!!!!!
Incroyable!!!
And here comes Frusciante to save the band once again....thanks
Perfect...love it
My soul for a song from RHCP
Welcome back John Frusciante 💯👌
McFly et Carlito 🦅🥁🤟
Amazing vibe😍🤩🤙
no bom lugar toca RHCP!
Sucesso
AGUANTE FRUSCIANTE LOCOOOO!
will ferrell never failed to amused me
Thanks Lionel Richie, nice comeback
Been too long, wb !  ❤
the best duo John Frusciante and Flea
Cool to see they got Will Ferrell on the drums!
If Frusciante ever quits again => Please stop RHCP. It won't be RHCP Period
Keidis doesn't look any different to how he looked 20 years ago. Like, I'm sure he's had surgery and other um "treatments" to keep him looking like that, but it's still impressive. He doesn't obviously look like he's had a heap of work done so he pulls it off.
It's always nice to see Will Ferrell back on drums.
Welcome back John, you've been missed! So happy to hear a re-new RHCP sound!
Crazy how they always get Will Ferrell on drums for these videos
im crying my heart out just hearing john's guitar in a new chilly song, cant describe it , IM just so happy....
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
wait wait wait.... john's back!?
This is beautiful...This is the same artistic quality of Otherside,Californication,Scar Tissue Under the Bridge and all the earlier classics.... Africa is listening.....🇿🇲 Zambia is listening 👏👏👏
One of my High school era fave band..and still productive till now. Salute
Black Summer Death Magic
Can't stop listening to this song!!! Definitely seeing them once they start their tour 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Hey grandpa, can you sing me a song?  Ok bud, just bang your head a little..
I've been waiting 😘
Frusciante's back!!
John Frusciante on guitar ❤
Thank God for it ...I've been missing this Chili Peppers old vibe ...Finally a song that sounds much more like Californication album ,  I’m an old new fan from the late 90’s 'til then and well the last albuns does not sounded to my ears like old Chili Peppers style of make music , the style i love so much they do ...But this song Wow baby ! It makes me feel the will to take some waves over there ...Wow !!!!!
jest i kurwa petarda lutowa<3
👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊
Yay John Frusciante is back -
Te amo John Frusciante♥
Wow Anthony Kiedis totally looks like taxi driver from By the way video!  :)

FLEA sei la ragione per cui ho iniziato ad amare e suonare il basso... la sua energia e il suo spirito da anni accompagnano la mia passione per la musica. Grazie ragazzi, la vostra musica non morirà mai. Siete i migliori da sempre.
Los esperamos en 🇦🇷 y a la salida nos tomamos unos ferné en botella de Coca cortada a martillo y cincel 👀

https://youtu.be/llc4gwGtXtE
My uncle put me on the rhcp when I was 9.  I’m 33 and still rock w them always have always will
They're ageless.
Fodaaaaa
WOW 😍
Não sabia que o Will Ferrel era batera do red hot, sensacional.
John really makes a difference. His chemistry with the band just makes their music stronger as a whole
I just love Will Ferrells drum flow.
There's goona be black summer this time for sure in Nepal (:
comment ruiner une carriére en 1 coupe mulet lol.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Feel so damn great to get something new! 🔥✊🖤💀🇱🇰🤘🏼
There's U2, Coldplay, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi.... Red Hot Chili Peppers are just as Iconic
It's that you Iggy?
The boys come back...yeah
In case anyone didn't know, the song is about the Australian "Black Summer" bushfires of 2019-20. The lyrics make it pretty obvious.
And it's  still...Red hot chili peppers...The legend at there best...🤟🤟🤟
💥💥💥💥😍❤️🔥🔥
Som esta foda de mais, bom ver as bandas antigas voltando a lançar inéditas!
popicovka
Mike Patton >Tony Keidis
This song makes me dance
perfeito sem defeitos
I love RHCP Red hot Chili Peppers , เรด ฮอต ชิลลี่ เปปเปอร์ เพราะทุกบทเพลง I respect this band
Love the peppers! Awesome video and nice song👊
musica boa de mais, ansioso para o lançamento do álbum completo
Who else is happy to see John back where he belongs?? 🥰🥰🥰
A voz do Anthony e os solos do John já fazem a música ser melhor do que 95% das que saem hoje em dia, ainda tem o Flea e o smith flutuando lindamente na música... Com toda certeza meus dias ficam melhores, só agradecer a todos, Chili Peppers !
good guys
Wow, it's great to see John back.
Regreso
O wow a new song never thought we get a new one such a fan listen to you daily
John is a genius, no doubt. However the song has a very same same feel as material from stadium Arcadium, it sounds recycled. It’s boring. Anthony is surely getting past the point/age of taking his top off, fit or not. By the way was them at their peak.

They're still hit the same💯
Frusciante esta de vuelta y están mas frescos y llenos de música como nunca. se puede notar la hermosa conexión de los 4, me encanta escuchar esta canción y  sentir la esencia intacta de los red hot
Просто надпись по русски)
SOME PEOPLE JUST SEE THIS VIDEO OR LISTENS TO THIS SONG, JUST LISTENING TO THE MUSIC, BUT ITHINK THIS MEANS ALOT FOR THE RHCP FANS, BECAUSA IS THE FIRST SINGLE THAT THE BAND REALEASES AFTER THE RE-UNION OF FRUSCIANTE, MEANS ALOT OMG
Prett....
Look, who's come back?😎
FINALLY!!! THAT SOUND!!!! ❤❤❤
Original Red hot chili peppers ❤️
two words John Frusciante. That is all.
Tô tão feliz com esse retorno triunfante deles com o John q nem ligo se o Anthony errar as letras ou mandar um Califórnia no meio das músicas , só vem unlimited love

Sounds like a song that didn't make Californication
Glad to have you back but I m only hearing mad world by Michael Andrews. Nice lyrics tho
The moment the camera reveals (despite everyone knew it before) who’s on the guitar 🥵🥵 goosebumps!!! It’s John mmotherf*cking Frusciante
Desde siempre es mi banda favorita. Saber que ya están creando nuevas canciones me da felicidad. Que bien suena este tema, ya con los primeros arpegios de John y cuando comienza a cantar Anthony me voy en trance.
It’s not rhcp without Frusciante, thanks for coming back ♥️♥️♥️
I've been waitin' 🎶 Thank you RHCP!
That was really good I enjoyed that
Welcome Back RHCP, Argentina love's you !
Idk why... but YouTube recommend this and i love it
Damn, I've been making a bet that their new album (with John's return) would be mediocre and overhyped.  So far, I might be losing my bet. 😅
♥️♥️
LOS AMO!!!
:"D  regresaron
Finally, something good in 2022...miss you john😇🤙🤙🤙
TEM QUE TOCAR NO ROCK IN RIO 🇧🇷
Lagunya klasik rhcp banget, lagu lama yg baru direlease kah ini?
The Frusciante’s come back 🤗🤯🤗🥰🤩
Will Ferrell is still killing it on those drums!
Here for the Frusciante
Came to the comments to see what people were saying about the lyrics but I don't see anyone talking about them :(
Oh my god, the "ahh...ahh...ahh" from John is coming back.
Smooth AF
Same guitar since Scar Tissue
O my god... I am young again
Is he john wick? Welcome back
#LaViDaeSMuSiCa 🎧 ❤🌶🔥

It's about time! God been waiting for like fire.
China on the dark side of the moon lines, Frusciante soulful solo and his Hendrix thing, cool!.....
Moustache.
Never old!
De volta as origens... Apenas
C'est toujours pareil Aucune surprise musical Je me suis fait chier à l'écouter...  C'est comme si on regardait un film avec un mauvais scénario, où l'on sait ce qu'il va se passer en regardant les premiers minutes. Et bien c'est ce qu'il ce passe pour cette musique. Ils auraient pu mieux faire. C'est du vu et revu 👎🏼
Just discovered this song!Amazing!
Fucking classic RHCP. So good to see Frusciante hitting the Jimi licks again.
Lo mejor de lo mejor, I love RHCP
i need a cigarette.
สุดยอด....ครับ เมดอินไทยแลนด์ รอมานาน  John frusciante ชอบ ครับ red hot chili pepper
Will Pharrell is looking old.
Frusciante 4ever
This looks like to a mix of Californication and By the Way albums. Good, I'm like it.
Bado wale die hards ka mimi bado tuko.
First couple of seconds I was like meh, but as soon as everyone tuned in I was like yep this is RHCP <3
Welcome back Mr.F
vamoooooooo !!
Iggy Pop looks rejuvenated
Damn I thought it was a Danzig cover. Still good tho. Lolol
John Frusciante is back!
It's been 20years ago...
otimos como sempre, banda realmente incrivel!!!
Long time no see...
John❤
No tik tokers this isnt a new group.
💯
So happy to see John Frusciante back! A brilliant musician with a beatifull soul!
Just amazing.
So good to see John back. Waited for this for so long
It feels like a 90's song. Just the way i like it!
ROCK MUSIC LOST ITS BALLS Really another crap song from the band I grew up on....not sure what drugs they are doing or stop doing ...but this is along way away from the funk Rock that they we're... I miss the 90s RHCP ...oh well guess this what sales now days...
love it. another hit!!
I love how their music manages to cross generations and never grow old forgotten.
Anthony  😍😍😍😍😍😍
Looooooooove this song!
Это шедевр ПЕРЦЫ
Just hearing this remember Way back they was dressed like the Flintstones  and I liked rock music from there glad to see them still rocking this really put a smile on my face this morning hearing these guys
this sound is wonderful 🖤🎵
Man Will Ferrell is crushing the drums
fundo verdeeeeee [leia com eco]
El retorno del gran Frusciante :')
Nunca Desiludem .
Épico, creo que ya es un clásico!
Omg John is back
Song is great if being Honest no feeling the Hair Style.. Kind of has that Prison Hair cut look.. Just saying. Great Voice as always and catchy song..
GOD LEVEL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Flea with clothes on?! Now this is a rarity!
Look who is back. Nice..
Amazing 👍👍👍👍
Will Ferrells nuts all up on that drumset👐
Will Ferrel on the drums!
one word: nostalgia
I saw them on the first tour UK tour for Mothers Milk with John in Newcastle, at The Riverside. He was still a teenager, and looked absolutely terrified. He's 100% as important as Flea to their sound now, they never sound as good without him. Ps they played as a five piece, with a guy called Tree on trumpet, and they did the sock encore for the last song!
Good to see them but, wondering wat the song is about, narrative?
Great!!!!
Que emoção ver vocês unidos de novo! <3
Johnn is JOHNN
the kings are back
Awesome tune !!! Glad that frusciante is back.
Amazing.. 🙏🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coming back with a bang
Que lindo ♡
I suppose there's got to be one weak song on every new album
Flea is so happy to make music with John again! 😀😀😀
I'm not the biggest fan, so I started listening to this thinking it was a classic song until I saw the "3 days ago" and realized that their style is timeless
I love it is very cute🥰🥰😍🥰🎧🎧😘🎧😘🎧😘🎧🎧
Wow, amazing stuff, love it when John is back
Frusciante <3 <3 <3
Anthony's voice sounds like he should be on the soundtrack for Gangs of New York 🤔😆
Fan grazie a mio padre! E spero che a giugno possiamo finalmente venire a vedervi all’evento Firenze Rock! 🔥
Música bien echa🙆‍♂️💫
Que bueno es ver a John Frusciante de vuelta con los chilli peppers.
Essa arrepiou até a alma! Red Hot sempre e pra sempre!
Goosebumps...everytime,...through the whole song.Found myself randomly stomping my garage floor to the beat lastnight at midnight putting my cylinder head back together...I finished though.THANKS RHCP❗😜❗
Good morning#Chefmanachinna
Buenisima cancion .Los red hot siemprw te saca cancionea exelentes
จากใจคนไทย สุดยอดมากและหวังว่าจะได้มาแสดงที่ไทยอีก
Me encanta! El tan esperado regreso aquí esta, y es para disfrutarlo a pleno, no soy de la generación RHCP y sin embargo siendo tan joven y poder ver su música nueva, con esta formación del grupo, estoy muy emocionado de poder vivirlo!!! ❤
Look Will Ferrell is playing the drums again.
I missed them.
1.25 speed brings the old school RHCP back
Anthony Kiedis looks like a frankenstein of 2 different people - from the neck up he looks like the guy who peaked in high school, injured himself playing football so he lost his scholarship and just tinkers on his classic 70's firebird with only his bitterness to keep him company while drinking beer and hitting his wife....And like an MMA fighter from the neck down.   #weird.
That moment at around 13 sec when the bass goes deep hits my soul like a uppercut
You never fail
OMG MUITO GOOD FINALMENTE AI SIM
Legends Never Die.....
Great stuff. Lyrics spot on! Censorship and headless horse. Thanks for not caving in to the mob and standing up for what you believe in.
RHCP 🔥
😭😭😭😭😭🥰😍😍🤩🤪😍🤩🥰
👏👏👏👏👏👏
😘😘😘😘😘
😍😍😍😍
This song i think could have easily been on Californication :) sounds a bit like that era rhcp
top demais red hot com esse guitar outra vibe´´´´
30 years later he is still shirtless. 🤣
❤️
Is Anthony allowed within 500 yards of a school?
Long Live Legend 🙏🙏🙏
Frusciante back with RHCP is the best thing to happen to music since 6 years! 😎😍
So happy I did not Hear the Word "California"
I will fight anyone who says this song isnt awesome
I love to see Will Ferrel on the drums! He rocks
Stay strong people the black out is coming.
Justo cuando más los necesitábamos!
This was the way to start a new week!!!!! God you guys havnt changed abit and that's what keeps me coming back again and again. If it's not broke don't fix it and keep up the awesome work.
Godno 👍
캬
So good.
Always Loved them
Boring song. Wish Klinghoffer doesn't leave
Absolutely great to have Frusciante back - no other gutarist can take his place. And the songwriting is of course unmatched with Frusciante back.
Melhor banda da antiga geração do ROCK...........e melhor banda ao vivo
Where my 311 boys anf girls at ??!??
I'm obsessed with this song, it's just so beautiful ❤️
Best!!
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS,, SIN JHON FRUSCIANTE, NO ERAN RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!! LOS HE AMADO TODA MI VIDA!!!!

Un ejemplo clarísimo de mantener la esencia después de décadas, y no venderse al comercialismo musical, cómo sacar un feat con Bad Bunny o Shakira
You can totally hear that John is back
No me canso de oirlos y verlos..
I actually like it . RHCP are music legends !!
Whao, he didn’t say California !
Lazy pop ballad, I would expect much more from RHCP...
dayum Ferrell's good at the drums
GREECE is waiting for you on our Black Summertimes..... Especially the last ones......
Ну такое... Cant stop top👍😁

A brilliant RHCP!!! COME TO BRAZIL!!! We, me and my daddy, LOVE YOUUUU!!! SINCE 1990 and FOREVER!! ❤️❤️❤️

John is a monster of guitar.
Y pensar que en 30 años mas menos voy a volver acá a ver mi comentario...  como con todos temas de los rhcp.
sekian lama RHCP br ngluarin single ya?
Pls keep your music goin' on ~from 90's generation here
It´s been quit a few years since I last heard RHCP. It´s pretty cool they now got Will Ferrel on drums
Oh god.. How John Frusciante makes a massive difference. I missed him SO much. 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wauuuuuu aivan upeeta 🧡🧡🧡
รักเพลงของน้าๆเหมือนเดิม👍💪❤️
They open a new portals to other dimensions when playing together!   ... And ohhh this gnarly solo tone !!!!
Anyone else getting "Slow cheetah" vibes during the chorus?
OMG, my favorite band in the galaxy, you've just made my day!! My dull, tiring Monday day
This song sounds like a sterilized, Top40 ready version of slow cheetah but it's great the see the band working together again and no doubt the rest of the album will be much more interesting.
Sem comparaçoes
This has strong Stadium Arcadium vibes to me... feeling it big time. So excited to see them live!
Легенды вернулись!
This has grown on me massively.
Nossa, toca mais uma aí por favor! mais um, mais um!
Very nice
I'm happy that Mr. John Frusciante is back!!!
r.i.p diego verdaguer 💔
ta faltando like nessa bagaça mano. banda da adolescência <3
They are back!!!! Great song!
And just like that, frusciante gets me lovin solos again. Thankyouuuuuu
Frusciante merde ce gars il sait jouer !!!
O som que estava faltando..
Anthony!   No Bowl Cut Mullet.
Came here for Wil Farrell.
Hello, My Darlings.
🔥
Fc from thailand 🤘🤘🤘
🤪🙆🏽‍♀️
Man John and Flea still got it! They all still got it, so glad they’re all back together 👽 🛸 🤘🏼
Sounds like by the way album
John is home <3
This is fantastic. スゴイ!
they never fail to impress, welcome back RHCP!
Frusciante nasceu pra tocar no RHCP. Incrível como a banda manteve a qualidade instrumental e vocal. Sem dúvida um ícone do rock mundial. 🇧🇷
The legends are back !!
Anthony should go back to doing the funk rap stuff. Hi singing distracts so much from what Chad, Flea and John do together, in my opinion. That being said amazing to hear them all together again, and they have the same presence together, incredible.
最高！！😭
Finally! The legend is back🔥🔥🔥🤘🏼
welcome back john !!!
🤧🤧🤧🤧💕💕💕
We feel you, brother. Love and keep safe  from Australia 🇦🇺💕
Has his voice aged do he sounds like Ian Anderson? There’s no replacing John frusciante he’s the man
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Por siempre RHCP
ジョンのギターはやっぱり聞いてて気持ちが良い
Как всегда лучшие
Ура , хотябы нормальные песни в тренде
Longevity
Why does John Frusciante never get old?
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥
This slaps harder than my abusive father
Que solo meus amigos .. que solo !
Will Ferrell is as great on drums as always!
that beat is so original 🤩
Linkin Park X RHCP PLEASE!
welcome back john you a legend!
0:46 Slow Cheetah vibes right here.
ジョンフルシアンテ最高だなあ❗

I love you all
My man looking ripped
The world is healing, RHCP are back!
Отличная тема! Но выше Under the bridge и My friends не будет ничего и никогда!( Но это не точно!)))
Il a prit un coup de vieux notre John mais toujours aussi CHAD MY MEN !!! Il est juste trop bon. I love it so much. I like that ! Give me more !
It’s 2022 and Chilli peppers dropped perhaps a top 10 Chilli peppers song of all time! These guys are unbelievable!! This song would have taken the world by storm if it was mid 90s
The Freddie mercury look suites him. Glad you guys are back.
In headphones I love how Anthony's vocals sound real "boothy" in that you can hear him in the booth. This os a pretty good song. I'm really hoping they can top the getaway. That album was fire despite so many ppl shitting on it. I think it's their best album of this century. I'll be let down if I don't love it.which I think there's the possibility. They don't have bad albums, but there are a few with a few songs I wasn't huge on, or the sequencing was just kinda off
Wow john killed that
And Chyner's ern the derk side of the meerrrnnnn
This just confirms two facts about Anthony Kiedis: 1. He doesn't age. 2. He's allergic to T-shirts.
California V I B E 🏜️
😍😍
I'm 32 and I am yet to have a body as ripped as the Kiedis.  Maybe i'm not old enough. I'll just tell myself that.  *SIGH*
My favourite grandpas 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤
ZERO dislikes :)
0:45 SIIII BEBEEEEE
Uma merda
สมกับการรอคอย สุดยอด มากๆ
So glad to hear this tune, you nailed it boys, glad to see John is back. Hows this for a random thought?   Welcome Back Carter analogy: Sweathogs are back. If they made a video of this or other upcoming songs on this album my take is that Kiedis could be Vinnie Barbarino, Flea could be Horseshack, Fruciante could be Freddie Washington and Chad Smith could be Juan Epstein. I suppose Mr Rubin would be Mr Carter. It would be an epic creative idea in my humble opinion.
Got Stadium Arcadium vibes. Love it
eddie guerrero?
Grupo de pessoas q vão no show deles no br , quando tiver me add hehehe
Dream a californication
Badas formation is back ..
Fruciante is backkkk!!!!!!!!!!
Goes to 10 million a week
John frusciante still is the best guitarist of our generation.
That guitar track is a national treasure
Does anyone else hear the autotune on Kiedis
Frusciante welcome back!
살아서 행보를  계속 보는게 축복 그 자체
Grande Brizz ti seguo da quando ancora lodid non era nel Valhalla
With all the respect, frusciante is the best  guitar composer of his generation. Amazing song, a forever classic. These guys are the best
woooooo!!!
It's so fucking brilliant, i'm gonna cry
Que merda de música
Man, Joe Exotic's got a great singing voice!
우리형들 아직 오지네ㄷㄷㄷㄷ 06년도 앨범 퀄로 하나만 뽑자 존프도 왔으니
LOVE!!
Eu esperei ♥️♥️♥️♥️
레드핫 가즈아!
I never knew Will Ferrell was the drummer in this band...
To me this sounds like a worse copy of something they already did a couple of times, without an interesting hook. Happy to read most fans in the comments appreciate it, I'm going to hope this to me is their floor instead of ceiling for the new album 😅
Lord frusciante is back to bless us all💯❤🔥
Amazing!!!!

Will Ferrell is doing an amazing job on the drums
FUDIDO!!! AWESOME LIKE ALWAYS........
insane
Пушка
John Frusciante...🔥🔥🔥
Danny Trejo is that you  ?
Can't wait April 1st to come! But April fools' is a strange day, hope you guys won't play a trick to us :")
So incredibly happy to the core of my soul to see frusciante play with these guys again they truly aren’t the same without him
We've been waiting this for years. Thank you guys for coming back, your music is our unlimited love!
Trash
Every single song they make is just magic even after so many years
Love the song, but John not having his guitar plugged in on the solo took me out of it.  Hahahaha.
Legends 👍🏻🌟
John back on the guitar nice
PLEASE COME TO INDONESIA!👍😁
So the most amazing thing is not that they're together, or that they kept their essence, but how fucking good shape they're still in.
🔥🔥🔥
They all change one thing they stay the same.
https://youtu.be/UVMZl7RyMxg
as usual the guitar tone & sound is excellent...
RHCP 🔥
Gotta love John, his guitar is so goddamn hot
Will Ferrell is an awesome drummer! ;-)
After so many years ...same ..wow 😌
Has someone already mentioned, how fucking unbelievable the guys are looking for their 60 years of age? Johnny is amazing for his 51 too.
This Song is amazing!!! It sounds like it was taken straight outta Stadium Arcadium, instantly takes me Back to 2006.
Though I'm really happy to see they still do what we all love, it somehow makes me sad to see them getting older. It's like a visualization of time passing by so quickly. Really love the new song and looking forward the next album!!! All love
I am just happy Will Ferrell still has a band with his friends
2:09-2:19 Damn  🎸 🤍 🤩
Amei bastante a .música e a qualidE dela!! ❤❤
Fantastic. Love it. The guitar work is brilliant
Gold!!!!
Did he say "platypus are a few"??
Anyone else remember when the chilli peppers used to be exciting?
Начало для вестерна подошло бы отлично. Песня хороша, но не особо отличима от остального творчества.
This is great
This song is like from the Californication album, amazing how they managed to keep the spirit. I'm in 1999 again!  I hope, i will see California myself sometime.
This song stinks.
There's John playing Little Wing again." _ Pat Finnerty
Hot damn its Red Hot Chili Peppers just as I remember from my childhood. Yes ! Thank you for staying true !
I can't. I just can't. Every time I see Chad Smith, I only see Will Ferrel.
So happy John is back 💜
Фрашанте? воу парни не стареют, а хорошеют. омг, время летит так быстро
Обожаю вас, ребята! Привет из России :)
Frusciante FTW!
7.3mill n counting 💐💐
John ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kiedis stole my haircut!!!
Puissant !
Will Ferrell on drums.
Que som foda, incomparáveis
Los mejores siempre!! Gracias por tanto!! ♪
It sounds great! Keep the level, RHCP
Frusciante lml
This is way too similar to Prodigy "Out of space" song :-)
Smith è sicuramente un gran batterista, ma la dipartita di Will Ferrell dalla band lascia non pochi rimpianti...
Produced by Rick Rubin. Enough said. He will always support RHCP to be RHCP.
Ахуенно сделал братишка
Simply awesome! Great song, can't wait to see it at live! 🤘🏻🔥
RHCP are fooking legends !
🥰🥰🥰🥰🤪🤪🤪🤪👍👍👍👍👍🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🖐🖐🖐👋👋👋👍👍👍👍💯💯💯💯💯🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fuck yeahh
Damn thought they might have done a Danzig cover :(
RHCP never die 🤟😎
NEW AURA BOSS AHH! ANG LUPET LANG KASI BUO PA SILA! GALING! ONE OF MAY FAV PUNK BAND SINCE 2004
Fuck yeah John Frusciante! 🔥🔥🔥
Охуенно
It's been long long time 🤘🤘🙏🙏🇳🇵🇳🇵
Stone Roses will live forever! 🥭
Wishing the black summer ended in the end of 2020
Beautiful song
Eddie Guerrero is alive!!! 😂
Thank you for keeping the music coming. You guys are beyond other bands to me
This fantastic four ❤️❤️❤️ Love you John 🔥🔥🔥
What the World needs right now/ Welcome back! Boys of summer LA .
We missed you John Frusciante !!!!!!! 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I think this band has John wick as guitarist.
Pensé que Diego Verdaguer había muerto :0
Simply THE BEST!!!!! <3 Love it  tunes...
Will Farrell's still got it 👍
Джош, конечно, был молодец, но... Вернулся ОН, и все снова зазвучало как НАДО. С возвращением, любимые Перцы!
red hot chili peppers never get old, I'm love this song 😁🇮🇩
That’s so fuuuuckin bloody sugary
Thats now become one of my top 3 favorite solos of all time just like that
Black Summer and Dark Necessities might be the 2 greatest songs this band has ever released. How do they keep making magic at this level 38 years into their career? I love these guys so much.
fleaaa wkwk
60 YO KIDS!
Awesomeness 🤟😎🤟🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Groomer: Peggy Wright" What?
I think they have officially lost sight. It was good while it lasted fellas.
Frusciante is really back?
what the fuck is happening with the vocals.
Although Blood Sugar Sex Magic cannot be surpassed, they (with John that is) still make sweet, melodic music. Chad and Flea are maybe the greatest rhythm section in rock music the last 30 years, and Johns guitar playing complements Anthony’s singing wonderfully.
Simbah simbah main musiknya tetep sama dengan 20-30 tahun lalu. Salut!
John is back to where he belongs
Eu rezo todas as noites para que uma música minha seja quebrada, eu sei que um dia eu direi, não é fácil, mas eu tenho FÉ algum dia o dia chegará
🤘
🇹🇭 Love #RHCP
video mozzafiato!!!
this is why life is worth living
Why is Anthony singing like a leprechaun? His pronunciation of Sailor, Dark, Archer, makes me want to hide my Lucky Charms.  Frusciante is owning this song. Not even flea can touch him.
RHCP is backk
I like it, John is killing it on the solo!!!!!
Black summer is amazing song.. good music
Love RHCP, but the tash had to go
Nice
Отлично!!!
40 años de esta banda y quedan 4 en tendencias de musica. rhcp volvieron
Ohh.. Yes... The great song.. Amazing  video...Anthony Kiedis&Flea in a fantastic form.. Rick Rubin&John Frusciante❤️are back....The old and fabulous Red Hot Chili Peppers are coming..Ladies & Gentlemen.! I love it and waiting for the album... CALIFORNICATION /FUNKY.. 💖I LOVE YOU GUYS... ✌️Peace&Love..and world TOUR please.. 🙏
How is ol' Blackie Dammitt doing anyway
Amazing soul. ❤️❤️❤️
RHCP still the best🤘
This is the next Californication ❤️
Sacha baron cohen, Will Ferrell, Keanu reeves & Smeagol are in a band together?
🤘❤️
The are daddies
They keep their essence! 😎🔥🙌🏻
I've been waiting ❤️❤️❤️
Why does he sound Irish?
Rhcp are born again......
Ironically I complain that this is more of the same while I prepare to listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik yet again
So good to see Will Ferrell still banging the drums like the good ol' times ;)
The song is actually really good.
So good to hear John’s guitar back in the mix again. Ain’t been anything close to the same since he left
Ojalá sean eternos
Classic RHCP 😁😁
Idola 🇮🇩
Irritated by Tom Selleck's beard singing a great red hot song
Yeah, I love this band.  I immediately could tell John was playing.  My favourite guitarrist of all time.  No doubt.  Love the new track. 🔥🔥🔥
I've been waiting...  I've been waiting...  For this album. I'm a happy men now😎
God Bless the USA.
Anthony Kiedis' new look making me nervous about my oil reserves.
In every album Anthony has a new hairstyle
Welcome back Frusciante.
Do these guys age? Ever?
Mi alma suena a los RHCP 💜🎧🎶🎸🥁
john復帰のニュース見た時は思わず声出てしまったな！高校の時から20年来のファンだから嬉しかった！アルバム楽しみにしてます！！
Los amoooo ,desde Perú🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪😍
🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵jay nepal
Welcome back legend
Pretty good.
John on the gitaar…it makes me cry 😭
Los amo tanto
Wow!!! He’s in great shape!
I love it when a band keeps doing, what they do best ❤️ Never change a running system. LOVE IT.
I accidentally started listening at a speed of 1.25 Then I listened to the original speed, but it was not so cool :)
💜Definitivamente mi banda favorita, muchas gracias por existir, añaden valor a mi mi existencia, hacen más placentero mi viaje 💜🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
So many spanish comments 😅 you guys are amazing! The vibes, consistency, awesomeness, all of it!
I felt sad for Josh but still he’s the best replacement guitarist for this band  ever, welcome back John
Fucking Hot! and absolutely true
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer😳🤯👏🏻
This song sounds like a song I've listened to a lot and liked it, but somehow I forgot about it, and now i found it again, very cozy feeling
🎸ETERNOS!!..🎧🤩👌🎶✨
This song is so RHCP that it makes me think that it ia created by AI.
How have you guys stayed the same, but so new for almost 40 years?!?! Every time I hear you put out something new, it immediately takes me back to highschool and those goosebumps I would get when listening to something amazing. Thanks guys, this is something I didn't know I needed right now.
i love u guys!
It's a rare engly comments
Don't worry, Anthony. We're gonna find the guy that did that to your hair!
Anthony has found the power of the mullet!  Our numbers rise! All hail the marvelous mullet!
OMG! What an amazing new song you guys <3 With John Frusciante again. Pure tears of joy ive got from this.
I CRY! ✌️🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲👍
Hehe
amazing
Просто, душевно, мелодично.Рад, что парни вместе!
Ummm.... what?
Fiz bons amigos sendo moderador do fã clube Rhcp no ORKUT
Nice fresh song 👍😉
the guitar cries, love at first hearing
Le rezo a esta canción 🛐
Is that Will Farrel on the drums???
I can’t believe Anthony Kiedis and Flea are 59 years old. They sure aged well. Time sure flew by. I was 18 when I first started listening to RHCP. “Blood sugar sex magik” was my first album. I’m 48 years old now. Thank you RHCP for the great music all these years.
ya estan viejos
Glad they're back. Very tired of electro pop 💩
#HIT 🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥
Legends
I BEEN WAITING!!!! THE RETURN OF JOHN I LOVE IT <3
GOATED
Nice production.
China's on the dark side of the moon 🌙
Sounds like a RHCP parody song
Epic
Either the expectation was too big or this song is soo boring.
I can't stop coming back to this song and video!!
Sound as good as they always have, saw them in the 90s with Foo Fighters. Great show. Amazing how they can still make this quality of music all these yrs later.
Ребята, как же классно катать под вашу музыку на горных лыжах!
Wow this is horrible.
Good to see they still got it
BORING as always
Amo tanto esta canción
Fantastic comeback! Frusciante just got into the habbit of leaving the Peppers for a while only to return and make the music whole again!  I'm so happy for this.
Lovelovelove
Постарели...
Singer is listed on Epsteins flight logs
Will Ferral lmao
Unlimited Love!!!!!
Увидел в 1991 году их клип Give it Away их музыка и голос были особенные, сейчас 2022 год ничего в этом плане не изменилось. Red Hot Chili Peppers одна из лучших рок групп 20 и 21 века. Их спокойные композиции это верх профессионализма и таланта .
I'm just here to say Anthony Kiedis looks awesome with that mullet and mustache combo
Californication once again
John Frusciante John Frusciante John Frusciante John Frusciante
I loved it
damn I missed this frusciante tone so much!
Alegraron mi corazón ❤️
Lyric person?
That 90s chili peppers essence 🔥🌶 And that Frusciante guitar solo never gets old ☀️
Genial¡¡ simple y sencillamente genial¡¡  Valió la pena la espera. Deliciosa música cada día cada disco son mejores.
Its like the guys never left...awesome stuff.
Huh - I never knew that Will Farrell and Keanu Reeves were in this band????
This song sucks
А куда делся Josh Klinghoffer???
I believe in Kiedis' moustache supremacy 🛐🛐
Jhon looks like the choosen one, Neo 😎🤟🏽👌🏽
Dammm keep on rocking you guys. This band has grown and and to improve all the time, it takes time to make such great music like this. Keep on rocking red hot chili peppers!!! May you surpass your success if you ever read this!!!!
What’s with Anthony going in and out of the Irish accident , I was cracking up
Anthony Kiedis taking off his shirt and putting in a mediocre vocal performance over a very good band performance feels like classic RHCP to me.
boring...same old same old predictable
apik banget....
Damn, this was amazing!!! I've missed you guys, so much!
Mis héroes han vuelto ♥️
i really want opiates
After a few listens...   try it!
Essa banda nunca erra!
Omfg how do i get rid of brazilian comments? we need a language filter for comments ASAP.
Foda demais! 🤘🖤
❤😊
im loving Will Ferrell on the drums
Thank you rhcp for this, I have just started my music journey, let me tell you that you are and always will be one of my inspiration, specially you John, I have a long journey ahead of me, I hope someday I can too help and inspire people with my music like you do.
The summer of 2021 was definitely a black summer for me
出た！
Awesome new song way to go guys  So glad to have John back with the band
John is to the guitar what Jesus is to religion... whether or not he's your favored savior, he's still one of the most impacting figures.   My favorite guitar player of all time.
La única banda que puede salvar al mundo del reggeton
기다렸다구요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
They did it again , another shit song
es el estilo que siempre eme gusto de ustedes!!!!!!!
This is honestly one of the worst rhcp songs ever. And this band inspired me to play guitar.
So good to hear the boys again.
My idolll
Okay, um, amazing song!!! I've been waiting for a RHCP song forever ♥ But uhhh... why is 59 year old Anthony more fit than 99% of men in their 20s????
Welcome back,john...
tocan bien saludos
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Really?
What the fuck is that? RHCP was genius ...was! What The Hell? Couldn't be better? Fells like it goog as it gets
loooveeeeee itttt besstt
VERDAGUER?? QUE GRANDES ENSEÑANZAS DIOS TE TENGA EN SU SANTA GLORIA GRACIAS POR ESTE ÚLTIMO VIDEO

Душевная лёгкая добрый вокал, всё красиво всё хорошо, в плэй лист однозначно пойдёт эта песня, МОЛОДЦЫ!!!
you guys should go back to ripping off faith no more cuz this shit is garbage
Meh, sounds like they had kids and went all soft.
La voz de anthony esta intacta! Increible! John siempre el monstro con esos solos
Welcome 🙏 back my teenage!
I liked Josh - but oh my god with John back my knees are weak
I like my Black Summers to be Dirty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kREle_uGckw
Love his twang in that first verse
Es perfecta
john aged like fine wine
I grew up listening to these guys. This is great to see. 🔥🤙🏿
ສຸດຍວດດດດດດດດດດດດດດດ

John Frusciante 🤩
Nice come back 👍
Uffffffff 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They came back ! Amazing song 🤗
Black Summer - lyrics  A lazy rain am i The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon   (Hit me now)   Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun   It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end   Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip   Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end   I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
No puedo creer lo buena que está la canción, la he repetido mil veces. El protagonismo de la guitarra y la forma como finaliza el solo es alucinante.
wow
Василий Иванович Чапаев рад, что Петька вернулся и опять гитару в руки взял.
WELCOME BACK HOME JOHN :') ♥
Will Ferrell.  And Keanu reeves. And flea. And 80s porn motorcycle cop. , I love it
The vibe is still alive🔥
Gracias
Autotune fellas?!
Me recuerda a los RHCP de los 90tas,me ha gustado💓
Great song. Great video. I love this! Rock on!💙💚💖
Queremos a los chili 🌶 peppers
John’s back! John’s back! John’s back! John’s baaaaaaaccckkkkkk!!!!!!!!!
So good, No.1 funk rock band rhcp.
Great guitar work on this one.
John Frusciante looks like Keanu Reeves
👍👍👂👂👂🙏🙏🙏🙏
I take a big shit smelly crap 🤧
Genios !! Vengan a Argentina por favor 🙏🏻🙌🏻 Gracias por su musica
Welcome back John
1st listen: eh, we really waited 2 years for this? What the hell is that accent Anthony?  2nd listen: this actually does sound like vintage chilli peppers…it’s not bad  3rd listen: (wearing full Irish leprechaun gear) “THE NIGHT IS DRESSED LIKE NOON, A SAILOR SPOKE TOOO SOON”
Black summer is over. Love is everywhere. Thank you, chili peppers.
Siempre es hermoso escucharlos.. Gracias por su recorrido y su trayectoria .. Si me habrán acompañado en cada atardecer con café !!
Simply Wow...
I love RHCP but this track is really banal.  we are very far from the inspiration of the 90s as with Blood Sugar or One hot minute.  Nevertheless, it's still cool to see them all 4 together
The Tiger King’s new band sounds great.
Who is listening 2022?
🤘
What... what the hell is with that accent?
Los amo ❤️
John!!! Woohoo, heck yeah brother!
Su música es increíble tanto flea, Chad, Anthony y John son los mejores, aguante los RHCP
A shitty Irish accent am I... but the rest of this track is Bangin’!!!
The king is back!
🗣️🔊🎶 🤙🏻
What's Will Ferrell doing on the drums?
Imagine being the "it" 80s band and staying that way forever! These guys embody that vibe.
Me encanta que continúe con la misma esencia. Hay partes que me hacen acordar a Californication
Что-то старички рока поголовно грустные и депрессивные композиции играть стали.Гормоны уже не те.
Sounds great guys
Frusciante fez Anthony, Flea e Chad soar mais Rhcp tbm. Aquele Chili Peppers da antiga voltou, caraiii!! Ihuuuulll
🤘😎🤘🌴☀️🔥🎸🇺🇸🦅
🤘🏾
Vibe always my peppers 🌶️
Nostalgia
Ok, I’ll say it.  This song is horrible.  Especially the Irish accent…. It sounds like someone is doing a parody of the rhcp….  Poor John, wasting a cool solo on this… 🏴‍☠️🦜🙈
You ROCK RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🇺🇸🙏🏾💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Vamos Brasil 🇧🇷 todo mundo nos comentários
Good song
I like their returning to their 1999/2002 sound. It’s like half of Californication and By the Way. I like the chill tones, but was hoping for more intricate/heavy “all killer, no filler” sound they have only really had with Frusciante back.   But I’ll stay optimistic about the rest of the album, and will still buy my August tickets and will fangirl like I’m in 6th grade again lol
Dónde quedaron aquellos ingeniosos, filosos, poderosos y  creativos rhcp? ahora con sus canciones pedorras, simplonas y extremadamente olvidables, infumables!!!
Burekku Sammeru
I haven't listen to Red Hot Chili Peppers in awhile, and this song proves they still got it. Can't wait to check out their new album, and I'm going to think about seeing their concerts if I can.
This is such a nice surprise! Didn’t expect this! I’m so so happy to listen to you again! I’m soooo exited!! 💕💕💕
These 4 again, making music, ngl i cry for a little bit, so many good emotions and a mix of nostalgia and relief ... thanks for all the years of music, pure and real music, you guys are awesome.
Aún tienen el toque! ❤️
That was crap.
How'd they get will Farrel on the drums .
RHCP have always been a great band but John Frusciante just makes them even better. Welcome back legend.

'Behind the sun' 👀👀
Anthony, ta voix me réconforte à chaque écoute et ce quelque soit le morceau.
Two Hot Minutes
Can't believe they brought Keanu Reeves for the guitar.
Terrible. Worst AK vocal ever.
So cool to see Will Ferrel play drums again after Step Bros 😉✌🏻
Heard the first two words and clicked like
I remember when they announced John coming back .. it brought such a big smile to my face to even think of new Music from them .. I feel musically blessed to experience this again ❤️
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer
Nostalgia al 100%😭😭😭
AS AN ARTIST AND FAN This fills my soul, its just pure magic. Through a song and the video they show us the beautiful return of Jhon, so many years of missing him, and he is finally back, they look happy, like when you brother leaves home and then returns home, damn the happiness and magic of being with him again. Thank god i am seeing this on my timeline, like in. 30 years I can say, I saw when jhon returned wow.... Thanks for the inspiration rhcp!!!!
Frusciante na guitarra dá uma assinatura diferente pro RHCP, não tem jeito o cara é uma lenda!!

i will never see Chad as anyone but Will Ferrell from now on!🤭🤭
Frusciante e sempre al top Cognome ITALIANO..
Da nostgia verlos todos juntos💛
They old, I can't accept it
Та же мощь, тот же вкус!!! Кидис вообще не стареет👏👏👏 Любимые RHCP❤️❤️❤️
pala q temon
John!!!!
2:24 The Empyrean vibes 🎶
I see that Will Ferrel is still a member of the band,
anthony whats up w the accent you sound canadian
I already preorder my vinyl copy
First listen: I expected more Third listen: WAITIN ON ANOTHA BLACK SUMMA TO EEEEENNNDDDDDDD
What do you call that twange or emphasis or accent that keidis is putting on some of the words? I’m noticing it around the “R”. He does it on sailor, archer and other words. I like it and I think makes the song better than if he didn’t.
Mmmmm, this is a VERY lush-sounding single. I love the guitar tone and the lyrics.
Indonesia ❤️❤️❤️ RHCP
This is awesome, hoe is this even possible in this era
😎🍻🤟🏻🏝️🏝️🏝️🏝️🏝️🏝️🏝️🍻🤟🏻😎
I have Thing Amazing John frusciante I love you Red Hot Chili Peppers Forever
де ти ПЕРЦыъъ ку норм
wow. they did it again. another absolutely fucking terrible song.
🇧🇷❤
🥸 What in the hell is this accent he's doing at the beginning of the song? That's goofy as hell. He drops it half way through the song lol
Ооооооееееее🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That solo!
Veeeaaarrrryyyy niece. Yeeus yes.
It’s like that old saying goes…if it ain’t broke don’t try and fix it!  Another banger from RHCP!
😎
Why does Kiedis sound like an Irish pirate?
melhor q darknececitt.  .falei
Uff 👌🏻🎸
know what? I have a problem with this video: it has an ending. Fuck it has an ending. All those years and these guys still haven’t released an endless videoclip? I am quite tired of playing it on repeat all the time.
THIS is what perfect Fender Stratocaster tone sounds like — damn, that solo is flawless — LONG LIVE JOHN FRUSCIANTE.
Another let down song from Cali Boys. Disappointing.
interesting but....im not feeling it
Definitivamente esta canción será un nuevo himno.💗
Featuring Will Farrell on the drums.
uma vibe faroeste
CRACKS 😭❤🕺😍
RHCP FOREVER!
Рай для моих ушей)🤘🪖
Legends of music 💕
Excelent excelent
to old but stay nice
Eu tô no céu! Eu sonhava com esse momento. Música boa nos tempos de hoje, e o John de volta.
Que bueno ver a John frusciante con ellos muy buena banda
Goddamn, this band still got their essentials even after so long
They'll always have "It". Even when their 90.
RHCP CANT STOP
FELICIDADES RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS SIGAN ADELANTE
This is what happens when artists forget how they did what they did and to recreate something from the past. Feels strange.
Thank you for the new song...🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Frusciante marca la diferencia... Simplemente diferente, único.
Saw them in 99 after Californication and they are still going strong 23 years later!
Dope solo
Is this a joke?
Em pleno século 21 e os caras fazendo rock lendários!!! VIDA LONGA AO RHCP
Come to 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Its so nice seeing John with the other Peppers, it's like magic when they're together.
Been a long time fan of RHCP...saw shows in San Diego at clubs before they got real big... this is pretty weak, kinda standard stuff. Not very special for being a new release after all this time
👍
Hell yes!! Even more pumped for the album!!!!!
Listening to this newest masterpiece makes me go back to my teenager years in the early ‘00s with Californication and By The Way. Such a nostalgic feel.
They've still got it man <3
Smooth & catchy,RHCP never disappoints
Glad to see John Fruciante back, like their album "They Are Red Hot" 🤣👍
great !
2:50 come​ old​ day.❣️💯
Best Band ALL the time.
Wao🤯.... Somos bendecidos por poder tenerlos a ellos... Frusciante magistraL.🎸🎸🎸.. Todos geniales.... Increíble como mantienen su escencia estando juntos.. 🤘🏼🎉
JODER QUE BUENA CANCION, NUNCA ME CANSARE DE ESCUCHARLA TE AMO RHCP
interesting. stadium arcadium vibes.
Good song. Dark Necessities was better.
🥲
Que maaaasssa
Red hot chili peppers are immortal
Gosh, what a contribution Frusciante brings.
Woooooowww amazing
Josh lo hizo muy bien, pero hay algo en la quimica entre Jhon y Flea que solo ellos logran transmitir.
This has to be a joke, right? "Chiners on the durk side of the moon?"  Did Anthony have a stroke?  This is so bad it's like RHCP are doing a parody of themselves.
Парни вернулись и вернули мне 2002-ой
Casi me meo cuando vi a John f. Te amo cabron x fin después de muchos años el sonido original de RHCP  Se viene algo gigantescooo ...
Yes John frusciante is back
Kiedis lookin like Danny Trejo
Isso é um exemplo de banda atemporal. Em algum lugar do espaço a música deles vai tocar.
Joe Exotic is really growing as an artist!
They’re still on their shape, 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 all hail the legend of the band history.....RHCP
Man I love chilis
top demais!!!!
How did Flea age better than the rest of them?
Es increible esta banda siempre sorprendiéndonos con gran material larga vida red hot
unaging
Still bumping this in the year 3000. You heard it here first, folks.
Anthony and the boys still got it after this many years!! GREAT SONG 🎵 👌
Oh my goodness maaaan! John motherfuvkin Frusciante! ❤️❤️❤️ It's so amazing that after all these years, the soul, the energy, the vibe are still there. Thank you for your music. So pure and honest
Jhon Frusciante?!!! O my...
amazing music as always!
Will killed it again on the drums
Welcome back john !!!
Let’s go John
i got really mixed feelings about this one i actually love the guitar parts of frusciante but they are to much of an excess like he used every leak that people recognize him from, and its kinda badly produced. They literally did what people wanted them to do a copy song of what their songs used to be like. its good but i feel it could be better idk
it's the definitely AGING LIKE FINE WINES 👏👏🤘🤘🤘👏👏... Regards from 🇮🇩  #PKNGTOWN
Thank you for bringing back Fruciante
Anthony, John, flea and Chad!! The band is back!!!
It's all about John, he's the glue and they sound so much different with him.  Glad to see he's back.
Welcome back Fruciante 🖐
old man rocks!!! great song, cant wait for the album
And they inspire me once again 💯
Un tema de los chiles picosos😯

Un oasis, un placer para los sentidos, entre tanta porquería, tanta mierda que llaman música, tipo Maluma, y demás regueton asqueroso, que aún exista buena música, artistas que hagan música, es maravilloso, ojalá desapareciera el regueton y solo quedara música de este tipo
👍👍👍👍👍👍🤯
still sounds like RHCP!  I LIKE IT :)
Will Ferrell the goat drummer
Anthony kiddies become Chuck Norris
Not to mean but Anthony gained some weight
Was this about the summer of 2020? And '21? And the 100 days of riots? Or ...ya know,cuz it was sad...what else could it be ..
AK真是越来越像林子祥了。。。
If it wasn’t for John Fruciante’s kick ass guitar playing, this song would suck
The finish is very bizare how it ends otherwise not bad hope to hear the rest soon🤟🏻🤟🏻👏👏🥁🇨🇦
Chili's left and came back as the chili's we all love, and John Frusciante is back baby!!!!
I love this band so much..
Anthony is a hair dye away from Joe Exotic
Black Summer: About global warming, pollution and forest fires. Haters: This band is racist. *Do some more research on the song, and then come write nonsense.*
Please Anthony shave that stash off. It looks like shit
Wow! Congrats Red Hot Chili Peppers! And thank you for taking me back in time back when the days were great!!
No puedo dejar de escucharla, ya quiero que salga el disco para comprarlo y escucharlo completamente. Mi banda favorita!
frusciante é inigualável
Hello johnnnnn...
12 Tahun lalu  Ditengah malam, ditenamin sebuah lagu Californication yang menggema menghiasi hari, Aku rindu saat saat dimana berada tepat di depan layar PC.
POV: You're trying to find the English comments
how fast time flies, for a moment I thought that old people are their role in this video
Lo esperábamos tanto y al fin llego. El ver como la amalgama musical de estos 4 músicos iba a volarme la cabeza. Que sonido del solo de John, ese bajo que no para, Chad a otro nivel y que decir de la voz. Estupendo tema. Que gusto ver a John de vuelta. Cheers Saludos
RHCP es sumamente increíble y es más increíble poder seguir escuchando su música 🎶 ♥
We've had two black summers forced on us without reason now. This is the closest thing to a third we should allow!
Used to love music until i woke up from all the brainwashing, theres a darker meaning to this song so prepare for an unexpected event. They are all illuminati!!!
I missed u together guys!
🙌🏼🌞
Tremenda sorpresa rhc is back
Yesssss!!
Digging it after a few listens. How Anthony says China is the same as how Trump says it lol
❤😍
They should have just broken up after Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  This song is crap.
I'm Aza from Aus. I speak English lol I wish youtube had a translate option. Great to see you back lads♥
Excellent guys
regresó John Frusciante!
Fruciante!
John frusciante!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Autumn Silvio, if you’re reading this I hope you’ve been well.
décadas de RHCP e os maluco não perdem a essência <3 FODA
Long life to rhcp!!!
Good to see Will Ferrell and the guys still working 🤘🏼
Revivió la música señores
Just......oooooooh!  Thanks RHCP!
John just turned himself in keanu reeves
I dont shit 😀 what ever you are said about this song .for me this is a classic rock and i love it.wellcome back john f.  Big fans from indonesian
Uhhhh rolón, me encantó!!!!
YES!! JOHN IS BACK!!
Un verdadero "fan" no insulta el trabajo de su banda o artista favorito por más que la canción o su álbum no haya sido lo que esperaban. Eso no lo hace un verdadero fan.
Sounds like every other rhcp song.
It's like I'm 16 again 😍😍 this vibes😍
This is a Racist band!!!
Incredible.
A true "fan" does not insult the work of his favorite band or artist even if it is not to his liking or it has not been what he expected.

A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
👌👌👌🙌🙌❤
Thoughts of song <Chilibowl cut
classic frusicante sound
Their are great but let’s recognize that this single is unusually weak
There's so much pitch correction on Keidis.  These guys needed to stop about 10 years ago at least.  Nothing to see here.
frusciante <3
The only timeless group great band
that solo tho
Kiedis rocking tiger king look 😂 lovin it!
Só de ver John destruindo mais uma vez é sensacional.
U guys should tune to 432
Is good listen music old... Made today.
Eu sei que está cheio de brasileiros aqui nos comentários. 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
¡FRUSCIANTE!
They have been my favorite band since 1992.
Black Summer 🎧🎶
Today on King Bob Marley's birthday too, we give thanks for his music and inspiration that transcended all borders🌍, no matter languages ​​or barriers ... how about we give love to this powerful combination that united Argentina🇦🇷 with Jamaica🇯🇲? https://youtu.be/xff3XFY-QV8
Listen to this 2 times, you will know every lyric, so instinctive & melodic, BRAVO!

Melancholia, black summer- I like this one has a classic arrangement
Great song
Бодро, а самое главное - узнаваемо.
When did Danny Trejo step in as lead vocals?
for some reason this song broke my heart, it's so beautiful
Salute to the Master's
Los amo son mi banda favorita 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤
It's great to see the guys back together but this song gets a meh from me. Only at the end did I feel a little bit of the old magic. Eagerly awaiting the next song, hoping it's better
Welcome back to the scene RHCP
🔥🔥🔥
That was fantastic, as always.
É tão bom ver os quatro reunidos nessa desgrama!
The same song since the beginning...we miss frusciante..
Ieu basa sunda nu saria teang hihi, tidak pernah mengecewakan lah
Glad to see that will Ferrell still got it.
McFly et Carlito !
Os homi voltaro
🔥✨
Hell yeah!
Loving the vibes 👏👌
Wow. How bad can this band get? Apparently really bad
Red hot marcou minha infância, show que venha mais músicas deles porque, As de hoje em dia não presta pra nada sem melodia nenhuma,  Red hot toca no meu celular no som e na televisão atno rádio 🔥
you should have retired in 96....you been beating the same old dead horse of a song for the last 30 years...
John Frusciante is a fucking genius!!
top 3 best bands in history!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
so glad john returned
Don't do drugs kids.
Mierda :(
I'm from Indonesia RHCP is my favourite band and i gorw up with music RHCP
guitar is so sexy
Sin palabras, solo disfruta
So cool to see John there…
Diego verdague no ha muerto jajajaj
No sé cómo chucha darle más likes a esta canción...
Isso é Red Hot meus amigos!!!😍😍
Este viejo esta cada dia más lindo xd
Vida longa ao Rock'n Roll e ao RHCP 🤟
Dudes can still jam
Legendary
never disappoints
mano só tem BR nessa porra
What does he say after "crack the flaming whip?"
Wasn't Kedis on Epstein's flight list?
Its amazing
what happens to music when the legends are gone. all we're left with is muffle rappers.... music is gonna be the next thing "to get burned"
"EMIT REMMUS" IS "SUMMER TIME". "BLACK SUMMER" IS "REMMUS KCALB"
They back baby
This songs  Sucks there’s  no Melody’s or chorus  What up with his   pitch  What a waste of John talent..!!
Goog song, Indonesia☝️
Grande Diego Verdaguer.
Voltaram com tudo! Ansioso para o novo álbum
SOMZERA
This reminds me of 2006 jamming the f*ck out to Stadium Arcadian with my dad. Makes my soul happy.
I really dig the subtle adaptations to Anthony's singing, really sends home the verses.
Californication....RHCP...from Indonesia...👍👍👍👍
Was just scrolling around youtube and the mere fact that there's new music from them brought a smile to my face, had to play it and now everything is better. They seem so young in spirit still and that's beautiful.  On a side note, tired of this overproduction as a rule now and the overtly sexual everything of the past ten years in popular music. It's only natural that when this era ends, we'll have some sort of stripped ambiance again where we can see genuine artists just being pure and not posing as a arquetypes.
It's so good & refreshing to hear John Frusciante's guitar again!  (If I spelled that wrong, sorry John!)
👍
😭😭😭🖤🙏
FRUSCIANTE BABYYY‼️‼️‼️
Red Hot é lendário!!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Brilliant Song - RHCP Are a Crackn Band and So Consistent - Shades Of Californication about This Track - Cant Wait For The New Album
❤️
Nickelback is better
Este si es un buen performance y no chingaderas
Te amo John
One of John's best songs yet man
Desert funk vibes
Finaly I waited so long and its great. The last album is now almost 6 years old. I listend to it when I was 16 and it was the soundtrack when I first felt in love. It of course didnt worked out but you guys followed me on my whole life. Still remember my first CD I got (stadium arcadium) when I was 6. Im exited to see a new chapter with your new music.
God bless RHCP !!! Greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Did they just sample Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad Of Dwight Fry'?
Dark Necessities NINGUEM FAZ IGUAL AO JOSH
Stadium song, cool. but there's something in the mix here? Too much production I'd say which is prevalent these days..
Thank thank you thank you  Needed me some new Chillies!
Obrigado!!!
Frusciante??? Omg
fuck yeah, john is back
Los amo con todo mi corazón; desde el momento que escuché y vi el video, me hicieron un poco mas feliz, mi corazón está feliz. Gracias.
🤘
I love that Will Ferrell is still playing drums for them. So cool.
Anthony, John and Flea together are genius.
John Fruciante is back!!! YES!! amazing❤
Same shit, different day... boring af. Just like Tool, shit gets old fast. If you've heard one song from the RHCP you've heard them all.
It's worth the wait.Definitely a masterpiece.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
is that john frusciante on guitar?
o baixo deixa a música melhor do que já é 🤩
I remember when they got on the stage back in the 90s at the MTV awards. I was like 13 and thinking what a bunch of jumping around morons. Yup here I am 3 decades later still listening to them 😍 #giveitawaygiveitawaygiveitawaynow
Muito brigado 😲😲❤🙏🤤🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🐼❤🏖
🎸🥂
🎧🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
I've been anticipating new stuff from them since they announced John is back. They did not disappoint! You don't hear great guitar solo and riffs like this anymore. Josh was great, but John just gives the entire band their classic sound and feel!
I've back to the 90's, just in the moment that i close my eyes and listen to this music. RHCP did it again.👏👏👏
Grande Diego Verdaguer, no habías muerto. Andas cantando en ingles.
They still suck and they always did .
Mt foda ver eles soltando musica ainda, estando ai por anos e que continuem. A anos acompanho, banda lendária ❤🤘🏼
RHCP 4 life
los mejores
🇧🇷🤘🏿✌🏿
ah para
My opinion: It's a grower, after the first listen
Amazing. Overly excited.
SUBLIME!!!!
Anthony letting his inner tiger king out. Lol
17 worldwide nice 👌!!!!!
🤘🤘 Digging Anthony rocking a Freddie Mercury stash!!!  lol But seriously,  new excellent music from them is fantastic!!!!  😉❤✌🏼
absolutely love the new vibe they're on....
THIS IS RHCP!!! Welcome back, John. 🙌🏾
OH MY GOD. I ALWAYS DREAMED THE DAY THEY'D COME OUT WITH MORE MUSIC. MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL TIME. LOVE U GUYS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW ALBUM!!!!!! 🙌 🎉
essa energia entre eles eh de outro mundo
🔥🔥🔥
Up!!!! RHCP Sempreeeeeee, CADÊ OS BR PRA REPRESENTAR A NAÇÃO??? #RHCPPRASEMPRE.  SHOW!!! 😎😜👊👏👏👏
I LOVED 💗🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Bravo 👏👏👏
Hermoso
Amazing, can’t wait for the new album. I wish I could see these 4 members live! TO ticket prices are too crazy
Frusciante is world
Sweet tunes kinda funky psychedelic rock n roll
They're back again, do you remember back then watching "Californication" on MTV and it's already passed 22 years since then.
Anthony is looking more and more like Iggy.
brutaaaal
ALTOOOOOOOOOOO tema
here's that ENGLISH comment you were looking for!  John is backkkkk babbyyy
Muito boa mesmo, musica que aquece a alma, obrigado.
Que chimbaaa ver a Frusciante de nuevo!!!
Love the Hendrix tone in this!!! 😍 welcome back John!
Great melodies, great tone, love it.
Repleat with Will Farrell and everything
No puedo esperar hasta que salga el nuevo álbum, volvió John madafaka Frusciante 🔥
🤘🤘🤘🤘
Oh, missed that vibe! Such a relief!
I am glad I am alive to see Frusciante back where he belongs, glad I'm here to see Kiedis become Eddie Guerrero, glad to hear another bass line from Flea, and glad to see Will Ferrel still playing drums like a badass!
No es Nostalgia, realmente me gusto🤘😊.....larga vida a Red hot chili Peppers👏👏👏
1:52 the god     john frusciante come back
GRACIAS POR EXISTIR, son mis ídolos de vida. Los amo muchísimo.
so the transformation is complete Anthony has become Eddie Guerrero
Sounds a little like Slow Cheetah
De arrepiar 0:36
Anthony is in great shape ...
Oh how i missed that guitar..
Leyends
Absolutely not. I saw you were coming for me to get inside my mass production. Absolutely not Red Hot chili peppers. Absolutely not!!
medio wack
This is a masterpiece
EAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why Anthony look like he’s about to hunt down an O’driscoll?
age is just a number, legenddddd 🔥🔥🔥🔥☝️
FRUSCIANTE I LOVE YOU !
Los Red Hot son quizá la única banda que mejora su sonido con cada nuevo álbum.  Mil gracias Chili Peppers... Rockeen por siempre!
It’s amazing to have a hit in 2022 with a 40 seconds guitar solo. Thanks RHCP.
They’re Hall of Fame for a reason 🔥🔥
Pensei que com a volta do John ficaria melhor.... realmente os melhores dial do RHCP ficaram no passado. Mesmo assim melhor que muita bandar nova ai.
Thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers for putting it all together  and playing this new song with John Frusciante! Wish you the best! One of you fans around the world
Yes lads! Love this. Muchos Nostalgia 🖤
❤❤🇧🇷
Whooooooo so happy
As happy I am John is back, Josh will be missed. Thank you for the dark necessities.
one more classic in history. 🖤🚬
For a band that is as old as they are still sounding just as good
El Antony le hizo tributo a Diego Verdaguer, me llena de orgullo ese muchacho.
i thought that josh klinghoffer will play the rhythm guitar, John Frusciante is backkk
Cool track but don't wash up John and silence Flea in the intro, the mixing jump scare In the final chorus sucks too
Red hot chili peppers 😍 es una leyenda.
What are they talking about. Sounds like some racist propaganda
WTF is that haircut and mustache?
¡Larga vida Frusciante, larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, impresionante sonido y energía que transmiten, bien hecho!
Anthony K. Looks like an Argentinan :v hahahaha just joking... AMAZING TUNE!! LOVE RHCP
Thank you! ❤️
Wow still kickin  a great tune.
Only clicked to see what the Nazis are listening to
Brasileiros dominando nos comentários 👊🏻
I won't stop replying till it hits a 7 Milli
Frusciante backing focal makes it legit
John Frusciante is back instead of Josh Klinhoffer? I think they're both great!   Edit:Just looked it up and he rejoined in December of 2019! Awesome! 🎉
That mustache makes him look like a Mexican. Song was great, especially the guitar.
Frusciante is back. The stars have aligned
will ferrel is great on drums
Frusciante at his best🖤
hahahaha Trash
This sounds reminds me  to AudioSlave 😘😍✌🙏
No offense to Josh who found his stride but there’s just something hearing John back with the boys.
Good, fuck, good
Amo d coração 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
wiiiii :D
its a good tune. i love John being back
😭😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕💕💕💕👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 yeah still RHP!!  Thank you!!! 💕💕💕💕

Frusciante is BACK!!!
Still got "it"--big time.
Vamos carajo, volvió Frusciante!!!!!
Yeah 🇩🇪🎧
Silverio ya en las grandes ligas :D
I don't know if someone has noticed this before, but Anthony looks just like a real life Tao Pai Pai
I know Keanu Reeves can play guitar, but I don't know he join RHCP. Its a good thing tho....
I can never get used to seeing that mustache. Lol
Do you know Mcfly and Carlito ?
o frusciante ta parecendo o john wick mano
Parece que musicalmente essa pandemia deu um reboot nas bandas, um monte de som legal aparecendo, Scorpions com "ROck believer" e essa do RHCP...long life to Rn'R!!!
OMFJCGOD!!!!
Woooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
💓🇺🇾
Incredible John Frusciante Is back, have no idea
Emocionante ver a volta dos Pepperschili... Fiz um Drumcover dessa maravilha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f2Kj5PFuvA&list=LL&index=2
Saw them in 1985. They were nobody. Damn forever ago.
You can fucking FEEL it's John on the guitar!
Fera de mais!!
i swear i've heard this more than 20x times since it was released
RHCP #1
🤘🤘🤘🇦🇷🇦🇷🔥🔥🔥
Methhead Mullet
And there will never be nothing like 90s Red Hot Chilli Peppers, no one can come close
Good to see!
I LOVE YOU JOHN!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU RHCP!!!!!!
john frusciante is my god
This was just 2 days ago.... that's ALOT of comments for just 2 days
😎🇧🇪
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Perfeita essa música!
The way Anthony is singing sounds like he is trying to imitate Gordon Lightfoot a little bit.
Ese solo…. Alguien que diga algo de ese solo
without words.
O início dessa bateria aí é da música Californication hein...
Moves like BJP
You guys are the best!!!
So good to see John back ❤️
It’s so great to see that you guys are still putting out music. I know so many songs word for word & it’s time to learn this one now lol. Soul to squeeze, scar tissue & Californication will always be my favs though!!! Keep it up!!🤘🏼
love this formation of rhcp <3
Que solo bosta para o tamanho que RHCP é!
Sooo Goooood...
Why is Will Ferrell playing the drums? tf?
When did Anthony turn Irish?
Meh
Amo essa banda
Es increíble lo bien que le hace John a RHCP, no te vuelvas a ir nunca más. Muy buena canción
PHEW....my heros are getting old.... 🤣🤔
У меня аж дыхание перехватило!!!
The song is not that good
Как же я вас люблю!!!!
Excelente cancion postuma de Diego Verdaguer con los peppers
АААААААААААААА. ЭКСТАААААААААЗ!!!! 😍 😍 😍
These cats getting Rolling Stones old. 😂😂
are you serious Keanu Reeves is now playing guitar in RHCP??? this man can really do anything
The best thing of 2022
Wow...what a banger.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Follow this band for many years, always with his unique sound, beautiful and fresh...
is that joe exotic?
Tenia miedo de que me decepcionaran viendo la trayectoria de algunas bandas pero creo que no es el caso. Simplemente sensacional este verano negro,  estoy deseando de escuchar el trabajo enteros. Gracias Red Hot.
Woww, después de tanto tiempo, que mega canción, enhorabuena, bienvenidos al show de nuevo!!!!
this band is a legend! grew up listening to their song. they're consistently been amazing ever since.
💣💥🔊🤯💨🎶
RHCP conseguem ter a mesma essência foda!!!!!! 👏🇧🇷
I been waiting, I been waiting, waiting for you to come to Brazil!
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰 ellos tienen un lugar muy especial en mi corazón!!!! Su música me lleva de viaje!!!!! Los escucho hace más de 30 años!!!! Amo a los Red Hot!!!!
The newest of this great band RHCP🎸♪ゞ♬♫♪
Not even trying anymore
Impressionante como essa banda, mantém a mesma essência mesmo com o passar de tantos anos, diferenciada de mais um exemplo é Guns n roses, mesmo com o retorno momentâneo não foi a mesma essência, mas agora RHCP é a mesma coisa desde o início isso é muito foda!
They pretty much can't make shitty music...I don't know why I was worried...You can trust the Chilli Peppers to come thru...
Is this a forgotten track from Californication? 😉
the return of king frusciante , we love him
John Frusciante, te extrañabamos ahora si los Red Hot Chili Peppers suenan completos. 🔥
I haven't been able to get the chorus out of my head since this dropped. I'm not mad about it. So fired up that John is back!
Love you guys!
Anthony Kiedis continua arrasando no vocais, RHCP é uma banda diferenciada. Esses caras são como o vinho, com o tempo fica melhor.. Rock do bom, amei 🎶🎧🎸🔥
Volta ao passado...Me veio logo "Anos 90".John Frusciante é a cara do Red Hot Chili Peppers.Black Summer já virou hit 🤘🤘
They sound as good as ever!
Frusciante volvió al lugar del que nunca se debería haber ido.... Felicidad pura escuchar esto 🌶🌶🔥🔥
Летом в Австралии постоянно бушуют лесные пожары, в результате которых гибнут животные и люди. Но лето 2019-20 года, было чудовищным по размерам катастрофы даже для «постоянно горящего континента»  В общей сложности, с июня 2019 г. по май 2020 г. в Австралии сгорело более 18 миллионов гектаров лесов. Погибло огромное количество животных, были человеческие жертвы. А причина засухи, как следует из песни, в том, что «небеса отказывались плакать» и именно отсутствие дождя вызывало возгорания по всей стране, а сильные ветры являлись причиной моментального распространения огня и разрастания очагов пожара.  Пожары были такой мощности, что ночью было светло как днём (Ночь одета как полдень), а леса и поля превратились в один чудовищный «крематорий»  Хоть бы капля дождя, Но небеса отказываются плакать, Кремация забирает большую часть вашего урожая, Ночь одета как полдень...   Слова моряка преждевременны, А до Китая, как до тёмной стороны Луны (Услышь меня наконец)  Утконосы появляются… В результате тайной жизни Ру Личность, которую я никогда не знал (Примерь это)  Мой кратер весит тонну, Лучник подался в бега, И никто не останется в одиночестве после захода солнца,   Прошло много времени с тех пор, как я завёл нового друга, Жду, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето!  Так было давно, и никогда не знаешь, когда оно повторится, Жду, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето! Назад пылающий кнут вышел из под нашего контроля.   Мы отправляемся в путешествие верхом на безголовой лошади, Прошло много времени с тех пор, как я завёл нового друга, Жду, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето!   Так было давно, и никогда не знаешь, когда оно повторится, Жду, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето! Я ждал, я так ждал…  Ждал, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето! Я ждал, я так ждал… Ждал, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето! Я ждал, я так ждал… Ждал, когда закончится ещё одно чёрное лето!
Um belíssimo e grato retorno aos saudosos e nostálgicos anos '80 e '90. Que som! Sensacional! Incrível! Muito obrigado! 🙏🏿🙌🏿👐🏿
oh great, another RHCP ballad.
Wow talk about jumping the shark! 🤪👎
the amount of auto tune is ridiculous
Im glad Keanu Reeves is back
I Miss you Red Hot Chili papper band Punk Rock
Oh my god
Why in his Lyrics, Whys China's on the Dark side of the moon?
Damn will ferrel stil got it
A voz do Anthony está como no começo da banda. Magnífica.
Que linda música hace tiempo que no sacaban mas temas músicas nuevas
Aí sim
so fucking awesome these 4 back together
00:47 “you’re as beautiful as the day I lost you.”
Grande John Frusciente! Essa música lembra muito o álbum Stadium Arcadium
Great song
Will Ferrell really got good at drums!
10/10
Eles dão um show 🎶
gracias!!!
Os comentários todos positivos, chega aquece o ❤️
That's what 2020 was.
Sounds soo much like Slow Cheetah..  Am I the only one who preferred Josh's stuff to this?
i feel i alive in 2000. RHCP product always fire🔥
Son leyenda . Impresionantes.. me siento más fan que nunca de la banda .... Están más vivos que nunca glorioso , majestuoso el regreso de John, me emocionan tanto... realmente los amo Red hot Chili peppers forever💖💖🔥💞
good stuff
JOHN!!!!!
🖤🖤🖤
Que llorera más tonta me dio cuando vi a Frusciante…
I love the fact that in 2022 we still got the RHCP at it, new music, new videos, same awesome vibe, big fan since I was kid in the late 90s.  Keep rocking brothers 🤘 🌶🔥
Now that sounds like Chili Peppers 🌶
Como é bom ouvir e aproveitar novamente uma canção desses caras. Incrível!🤘🏻
Grande Diego Verdaguer:')
Jhon frusciante !!!!!!!
Song seems not that inspired, and what's with the mustache? But who cares. What a lovely group of persons! Great to have news from them.
Most overrated band of all time.
That solo by John was so creamy. It isn’t just his guitar that is so important to this band sound, it’s his backing vocals to.
It's a nice song, but nothing great IMO. I prefer the premiere single from their last album a lot more (Dark necessities). I actually really enjoyed the overall production of The Getaway and how RHCP did things they haven't before such as adding a beautiful piano to some of their songs. However, my fav part of this song is John (not just guitar but his backup vocals as well) which gets me giddy to see what's in store on the rest of the album! I'm really just hoping they're ambitious on this album like the last and not just trying to revert back to 2006 and play it safe.
What a difference one legendary guitarist makes
Woke Peppers 🌶
ONE OF THE BEST BANDS EVER
RHP te quiero <3
A new rock song finally
Diego Verdaguer aún vive 😎
Muito bom como sempre, mas eu esperava algo novo, o Rock precisa de uma pegada diferente.
El arte verdadero es como el vino.  RHCP 4eva!!!!!
🤟🔥
🇧🇷 ❤️✳️
flea anthony and chad will be in their sixties ,,,,,, time flies by fast ...
Te extrañé, John.
Anthony, Sue your hairdresser!  Great song guys. I thank u 4 bringing back Frusciante.
Obrigado! Eu amo vocês!
I've been waiting for em to come back an they haven't disappointed im waiting for when the come to England again
¿No entiendo por qué siempre la gente insulta cuando no le gusta algo?  No pueden escribir solo "no me gusta" o "esperaba algo más" o cosas como esas.
Boring song. Structure and chords are disinteresting.  Nothing there. Run of the mill.
Cadê os BR fã eternamente dos Peppers ? Like
Feels so darn good to have my favorite vocalist for this band back at last in the lineup for RHCP…I’m talking, of course, about John’s guitar, and BOY OH BOYYY, that thing sure is SINGING!! Nah, but seriously though…  Welcome back, John!! It’s SO great to have you back where you belong! 🖤 🤘🏼
Will Ferrell still rockin' drums 😂
Fucking amazing go Johnny boy
I'm not a great fan of the band but, wow this song is the pure essence of RHCP 🔥
2:36 Gabigol
Frusciante é o cara! Sempre no lugar certo e na hora certa.
Wtf
seeing John back in the fold after all this time is like a dream come true, still doesn't feel real. this song is awesome
i miss this... a true living Legend... 🙇🙇
It's a lit it will bring back the glory of rock and roll
I love this song ! Cant wait this New album But anyway Please if you can go do the video with mcfly and carlito it will make all your big french fans really happy (like me ) but please go do that it will be really good !
BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC

Nunca perde a essência ❤️
Stadium Arcadium got me through one of the darkest periods of my life and since then I had a great run without losing anyone till recently   I lost so many family members but my dog mr jiggs    15 year nova ended. He died the day before they released this  song. We cremated him and It’s stole a piece of my supply   he was our shelter from the brutality of humanity    Im exposed to the times without him.   But still.  The skies refused to cry.
Y VOLVIO EL REAL SONIDO DE LOS REDHOT ...
fru fru está de volta caralho
Música ótima!! Red Hot Chilli Peppers é demais sempre muito bommmmm!!
How did Frusciante come out looking so good? He barely aged!!
Rolon 🇲🇽💙
Always lovely to see Will Ferrell 🥰
🙇‍♂️😎🤙🎸🥁
Damn will Ferrell sucks at drums
Anyone knows the reason why Anthony became Adam levine ..?!?!
The 90’s called, they are looking for u
Los putooooooos amos.
Viciante o som
Ohh soo goood^^^ the song the clip and very pretty muscles 💪
jojo ref
Getting serious Hendrix vibes from this song.  Also, does Flea never age?
Teardroped

The Entire Band Looks & Sounds Good. As always Thank you for bringing me back to life…AGAIN! Decade after decade, 3rd times a charm😘
Chiles Rojos picantes. 👍🤘
What a lovely surprise! Feels like such a familiar RHCP sound that I love and miss. Thank you for staying who you are 🙋🏻‍♀️👏🏼👍🏼🙌🏼💜🇨🇦
Apreciem 1:52 ❤️
Larga Vida al Rock... Carajo
been cutting my own hair during lockdown. it seems Kiedis has copied me lol
My brother past away last April and he was such a huge fan of the peppers, could play so many of their songs on guitar! Passed away playing his guitar, so in his memory I am determined to learn this song for him! ❤️
Wats this weird beginning sht ? Like checking the waves and thinkn Where's this Nurple from? 🤔 🤣
Thank you Guys i love you SOOO MUCHH BIG HUG FROM BRAZIL YOU ARE PART OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see their drummer (Will Ferell) is doing well!!!!
I know that Flea looks 80 years old at this point, but it's odd that they pretty much do not show him in this video.
Una banda con mucha quimica
RHCP ❤️
It’s so perfect when John comeback
Put 1.25x speed, you're welcome..
Gênios! Sem mais! Incomparáveis. RHCP não tem um gênero, é um gênero.
Glad you are back john thanks guys !!! And will ferrell too haha !!!!
2:37 Anthony Diaz
Welcome back, John!
Simplesmente sensacional
Wow! Listening in a cloudy Sunday to give me a sunny Monday. Thank you guys. Love from Brazil
im adorable for appearance of Anthony
Definitivamente mi canción favorita de este año 💯
NEEDS MORE COWBELL
I am time! I am space! https://youtu.be/haWCiNG5mkU
Quantas vezes você assistiu esse clipe?  Eu: sim
yeah them rolling blackouts in the summer are a bummer
cool
theses guys
Gotta be honest. Wasn’t into Anthony’s voice/accent on the first listen. 2nd listen changed my mind. John Frusciante’s return brings RHCP back to their glory days
Did i just traveled in time, a pure music without naked girls or tiktok trends or autotune AI ! Thank you RHCP for keeping music alive !
So nice to see and hear John Frusciante back in the fold!
Me gusto como siempre Red Hot Chili Peppers dándonos buena música Saludos de Venezuela.😎
John possessed by Jimmy Hendrix
Por siempre RHCP lover!

Me encantaban con Jhosh xq le aportaba frescura y buenas letras pero los escuchas con Frucsiante y es como q el tiempo no paso, es el sonido caracteristico de los Red Hot...
São mais de 20 anos ouvindo Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!!
Amazing
Rock!!!!

Garbage 🗑

Dude thought that was Will Ferrell on drums there for a second 🤣
💕🌶
Only Jhon Frusciante!!!

This is terrible.

Amazing!!!!
Gee i can remember being a kid and seeing these guys for the first time in a movie called thrasher.
OMFG the Peppers are back from coma. In a big way!
I can rest easy seeing these 4 rock out once more 👐
Brought me to literal tears. Welcome back John, makes me feel like a kid again.
Proper love this. 👌
Californication ?
Dude, you got a will farell look-a-like as drummer … 😂😂😂 no sht
O solo de guitarraaaa... Eu amo esse homem
Olho esses caras e vejo minha juventude toda aí, grande retorno do John Frusciante, vida longa a RHCP
Simplemente hermoso, me sentí de vuelta en el tiempo, que bueno sentir y escuchar que no cambian 🤯😍😍😍
Yeah
Still great ! Already a hit. 2022 will be better music
Anthony changed his aproach to music stylistically and now i feel that he doesn t fit with john no more 😆😆😆😆
Portugal and madeira island capital funchal he love you so much and jonh is the best in the guitar always not josh not navarro just jonh

Amo vcs
You make me fly!
Vers nice. This track is everything the peppers are all about.
Lo mejor de lo mejor.  lml
los amo con loura , por eso estan plasmados en mi primer tatuaje
RHCP is f*cking immortal... These guys will never die. Also great to see Anthony still fucking RIPPED at this age. Love the new sound
I wish I saw Jimi Hendrix in my life.  My Mum did.  Our guitar GENIUS FOR OUR GENERATION.  John. Thank you.   You have  brought the life of Guitar back.  I love you man.
Shivers, very good guitars I can see You talked Keanu Reeves into band, very nice move
Why does he sound Irish?
Thoughts:  Love the tune, sounds great. John is killing it Chad is killing it. Anthony sounds amazing Flea piggy back on Anthony? No, wtf
😍
Please shave the stache

Anthony is almost 60 years old and still shredded. Man, I wish I have some commitment to go to the gym. 😅
Glad I’ll be able to see the four again sorry josh lol but this is what we want
Love u all
We want chilli Willy
Frusciante in da houseeeeeeee
so good!!!  😎🌶️
This needs to be no 1 on the charts right now
The best drug from the best dealers on earth.
No que se habia muerto Diego Verdaguer?
Fucking Good!
レッチリサウンド最高
This song rocks well whatsup with the way he sings the intro? Sounds off, like he's someone else...chorus and guitar sounds good tho
Me encanta!!! RHCP😃
❤🎸
Premetto, non sono un estimatore dei Red Hot,   ho un solo disco, ma questo singolo, pur non essendo un miracolo rock, funziona e scorre bene. Ben strutturato, ottimi arrangiamenti, buon Groove,  chitarra limpida, e ben dosata, insomna fa il suo dovere. Ascoltato in auto è un ottimo pezzo da viaggio. Semplice ed efficace. Buono!!
Los amo mucho! ❤ No puedo parar de escucharlo!
Sooooo Geil!!!!  greaman greetings!!!
Feel like I'm in high-school again I live Chilli peppers
I'm an embryo and I can wait to get out of my mom's canal so i can hear this with headphones
⚡⚡⚡⚡
Muito bom ouvir algo novo, som maravilhoso.
I love RHCP!!! They're sounding really good!!! I've been a fan since Mothers Milk, its been a fun ride!
I can only say one thing - this is a good song!
This sounds like it belongs on Stadium Arcadium from 16 years ago.  And they still dont wear shirts, its gettin gross and uncomfortable at this point.  Look this song is ok but not refreshing.  I wish they would explore Frusciantes love of electronic music, instead of this same ol same ol music.  That would allow them to evolve and would push their creative limits.  Just look at Radiohead, they evolved into a beast.
Cuánto espero que el rock vuelva como el ave fénix ya es hora que algún loco fanático lo vuelva a ser y así el resto comienze a seguir

Show! Eles são o que são, sem mais!
Red Hot Chilli Peppers and ACDC, salute them for stay true 🔥🔥
Наконец-то, мои любимые перцы дали мне повод улыбаться. Великолепная песня, прекрасный клип, парни красавцы. Жду альбома с нетерпением, он сделает моё лето)
You're a legend!!! <3
Sizi tanidigim da bir cocuktum buyudugumu zannettim ama hala ayni cocuk gulumsemeyke yeni album geliyor diye seviniyorum 🤘🤘🤘
Great song! This is the RHCP energy. Feeling the chemistry between them is priceless
Cazzo se si sente che quella è la chitarra di John che suona!  Strano effetto tutto ma li amo sempre sempre alla follia!! ❤️🇮🇹
I feel the love in this  song  RHCP
TIENEN UNA CALIDAD INCREIBLE LA VERDAD ,VENGAN A ARGENTINA CHE.
Creativity: 4 Sounds: 7 Value: 5  Chad Smith: 4 Kiedis:5 Frusciante: 5,5 (only very good sounds, is Frusciante that make Hendrix shits, sometimes did great on thoose) Flea: 6
This feels good like an iced tea on a hot day. Just crisp and delicious.
Pinche canción hermosa . Regresaron al fin lo hicieron . México los espera
1M views are from me!
Frusciante is here, Frusciante left, Frusciante is back, Frusciante left again, wait Frusciante is back!!!!!!
The verses and guitar solo are really nice, but that chorus is lyrically embarrassing and sounds like nails on a chalkboard.
God damn this band still sucks after all these years 🤣
Will Ferrell on the drums
Cant wait for this song to be played live in London 2022..lets go
So after 🎧 to this song it's time to check out "Don't forget me" live again...
Veo qué no han cambiado nada es una canción muy Red Hot cero novedad pero se rescata él  vídeo 🤣
Que merda, hein...
Minha inspiração de adolescência...minha terapia de adulto.  my teenage inspiration...my adult therapy.
Larga vida a RH🌶️P<33
🔥🤘🏼🔥
I feel like the song is missing keyboards and the bass is way too loud
Gen Z here. Not all of us are lost
This is garbage
CARALHO, VAI SE FUDERRRR, EU TE AMO RHCP!!! VEM PRO BRAZILLLLLLLLL 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh im going crazy but this. Kiedis singig on crappy outotune is cringy tho :D

❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yeah guys, that's what I want
Yeah!! ☀️
Welcome back, John Frusciante!
back with a bang
I Love IT🌶️🌶️🌶️
Diego Verdager siempre con las mejores rolas  🎶
2:38 Damn, even at near 60, Kiedis still go some guns on him. They all aged gracefully, except Flea. He doesn't look terrible, but he didn't age as well as the others.
The middle solo is freaking epic ! Rock on John Frusciante !!!
Johns tone reminds me of hey baby new rising sun by hendrix
❤❤❤shooow
You can tell how important Johns playing is to Anthonys singing.
Extrañabamos tanto esos solos legendarios... Gracias por regresar RHCP 🤘🏼😎🤘🏼
That solo of John 😱😱😱😱😱😱
I Love you john
Can't help but think Anthony now looks very like Joe Exotic...
Odlična, BRAVO !
I think frusciante is using the same t shirt that always
Beautiful. 🌶️
Welcome Back, you uplift mofo badasses!
My favorite band forever 😍
Utterly, Brilliant!!
temazo
Whoohooo! Finally... and it's great!
New record from the RHCP. Life is restored,at last.

Bem ruimzinho.
Los RHCP: somos cuatro integrantes  Yo: Ay, John Frusciante <3
Thanks to RHCP for this Music, it makes me and a lot of others happy 🙌
música boa
This song reminds me of Andy Kaufman's "Friendly World".
After all these years Chad Smith still has to carry the band.
Whats will ferrel doing in the band😂
Sempre sonhei com a volta do John ❤️🇧🇷
Sounds like By the Way era chili peppers, which is no bad thing of course given By the Way is one of the best albums of all time.
Crazy to think he is nearly 60!
Aunque pase muchos años RHCP sigue impresionando a las nuevas generaciones por favor venga a 🇪🇨🇪🇨
dhr demais ver esses caras desde pequeno, sempre fazendo musica com esse jeito de doido sem camisa nos clips curtindo a vibe  banda lendaria, apenas.
Tiger king is out.
Anthony Kiedis is 59 years old and RIPPED.
Incroyable 😍
They haven’t been “red hot” in at least a decade
Com o John Frusciante ficam diferenciadas as músicas 👏🏼🎸
This sounds like an Irish story or drinking song but it’s a good song
I love you guys 😅 and thanks every songs from you ✌️ namaste everybody 🕉️
En el año 1991 fue cuando por primera vez los escuche, ese Blood Sugar Sex Magic me volo la cabeza, hoy a mis 45 años y viendo todos sus discos y cambios en el transcurso de sus años, solo puedo dar gracias por volver a velos juntos y emocionarme con la musica que estos 4, John, Flea, Chad y Anthony pueden crear en con junto. Hoy mi hija de 4 años tiene su polera y les encanta, sera un legado para muchas generaciones, aguante Red Hotby los esperamos pronto por Chile
this solo!! Bravo John for natural fuzzy expression hypnotic guitar great to see you again!
0% Drugs 0% Violence  69% Shirtless Anthony Kiedis 100% Talent
I am telling my kids this was Joe exotic ...
Esta canción es la polla
wow Can't stop to replay it ! 😍
Jhon's choruses are back!
Essa guitarra é mais Frusciante que o próprio Frusciante
me encanta!!
I feel like I'm listening to a different song.  I've been a fan since 1984. I just don't hear it in this song. Hopefully there are stronger songs to come!
I hope there are some tracks on the new album that are more fun than this
Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip💜🎶🎸
i think this kinda sucks
Woohooooo
🌶❤🇦🇷
So terrible
Esperen, y donde está el "California"?
Good taste solos are back!!

Gets better and better with each listen
Estos eran los tipos que tocaban stone cold Bush suck muy kiss aeroplano ? . Ahora están tocando un POPUCHO de 4ta por favor déjense de Joder!!!!!!!!
Everything in this song is bad and somehow it's got 6 milion views in 2 days. World must be hungry of new guitar music but the news is: don't expect new things from old men who can barely hold their instrument. Where is the melody in it? What's that solo, long, boring, a few pentatonic notes played over and over again? Im afraid rhcp is done.
The Peppers are back. Everything will be fine. So beautiful. 🎸✌️
Caramba, os caras continuam tops no som, nas letras, na energia e na forma física! Vida longa ao RHCP!*
All the masonic hand gestures.  Riveting.
really unbelievable what Frusciante brings to the band. They sound like they're 22 again.
Vaya por fin buena música.  Los  chilli peppers. Excelente. Hasta que dan vida.  Y excelente música como siempre. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
מה קורה עם השפם השחור
Now that john is back.. my years of black summer ended
Absolute masterpiece! Never disappoints!
anthony and whoul of you guys- yours are amazining forever!!!!!
GREAT!!! RED HOT IS COME BACK!
Love it ❣️ thank you guys !
Por fin buena música. Espectacular la guitarra. Su estilo es de los red hot chili peppers de los 2000'. Saludos desde la Latinoamérica.
Horando o próprio legado! Red Hot👏
Was hoping this was about zombies. But it’s good to have the band back together.
Frusciante faz toda diferença.
This song is actually better the more I listen to it

How the F! is Anthony 59 years old!?!
All this time and after so many albums and they've still got it. Try to name another band that's stayed this good for this long. There's very very very few of them left. Unquestionably RHCP are one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
1:50 I missed it!
Es un sueño echo realidad 🤩
https://youtu.be/LNC6YY4qpvg
Los amo!
Да.То что надо!
Зажгли как всегда🔥🔥🔥 В прекрасной физической форме, приятно смотреть. 👍
Everytime I hear Red Hot Chili Peppers, I can believe ther is eternity! So amazing, so much realive! Great! Simply great that we can live in the same time in which this band exists! I‘m only happy.
They are still gettin better, like good old wine. Fantastic! This Song saved my week
I feel like RHCP are on their 5th wind lol they never disappoint.
FantasticamasingGroundbreakingMindblowSoSweetCoolRHCPniceAwesomeHailYeah!TripBackgroundBlackHoleSuns!!
The drummer looks like Will Ferrell
When did john wick join the band?
Been a massive fan of these guys since I first came across them as a kid on MTV back in the late 80s when Mothers Milk was out.  Im 43 now and loving the new tune, so glad Frusciante is back 😁 (but I loved Klinghoffer's & Navarro's stints too, both kept the band going in Johns absence)  This band is the soundtrack to my life..... the highs.....the lows, Id be so lost without their music.  Cant wait for the new album.
Hungry for more
💣🔥💣🔥💣🔥💣
The circle is complete again. Thanks to the gods!
Californian machine works perfectly
It’s good to see Will Ferrell has still got it.
1:52 best John Fuckinh Frusciante  !!!!!!
Anthony kinda sounding like he's been playing Final Fantasy 7 Cosmo Canyon theme a lot.. Chillis are back!!! 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
2:10  Dab is not dead !
Eb ? Are the guitars tuned 1/2 tone down?
One word. Chemistry. Thank you rhcp
Энтони Кидис Похож на нашего Сантехника !
2002 con full hd
The gang is still going strong!!
mis pololos
🤤👍 Good times!
I'VE BEEN WAITING. STILL ROCKING IT BOYS. AWESOME JOB.
Wtf is wrong with Anthony Kiedis?!?!  Jesus CHRIST.  He really needs to take a look in the mirror.
‘It’s been a long time since I’ve made a new friend,waiting on another black summer to end’ has to be about John
Great that even Will Ferell changed Career and has become a drumer. Guess Covid changed us all.
Seeing them all jamming together again at 2:52 warmed my heart.
The old good friends are back
Han regresado ....🥲 RHCP son la luuuuuuuuuuuuz ......... 🔥
looks like a solo Frusciante album
Is that a mf jojo reference??????
Never gets old seeing Will Ferrell on the drums!
Nice song
Yuck 🤮
Yes, yes, yes! Holy Moly, you‘re back! Great! I‘m sooooo happy!
I feel like I missed him toomuch. Frusciante. <3 such a cool solo. Love these artists.
RHCP * <3
best guitarist in the charts
John is my favorite musician on this planet
Now that Frusciante is back we can all go back to seeing them live again
Great track! Love how they were on location for all of the shots in the video.
ETERNOS!!!,  Por lejos la mejor Banda en vivo del Mundo, Frusciante impecable como siempre!
Great!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've waited a long time for this moment, this is all I needed.
Come to Chile .... Peppers
I love Flea
Джоджо?
I love RHCP, this song is a great return.
Searched “Red Hot Chili Peppers Type Beat”
Really enjoying the direction they've gone down since Will Ferrell joined on drums
2 words... F*ckin' Amazin'
Glad John is back. Cant wait for this album. Cant wait for the show either I already have tickets!
И гитарка кайф
Еминем, кул
Good job guys
I really appreciate they're not trying to rap. Just more good, skilled, practiced rock.
🇧🇷 demais simplesmente únicos, Rhcp 🌶️❤️
Esto está buenísimo
Te amo john
This song means the beggining of a beautiful new journey They are back, and their souls combined  are a pure form of cosmic joy I cried watching this
00:43 gives me insane chills every time, holy shit
Siete il top 🔝🤟
❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍
Red hot chili peppers forever🌶
Frusciante is back !!!
John Frusciante just has that Xfactor with his guitar lines and melodies
Nice work,RHCP,keep on!🤩🤩🤩
Nostalgia, los escucho desde mi adolescencia, ahora con 38 años sigo escuchando los mismos sonidos, ellos también más grandes pero siguen rifando, bravo por mis red hot!! 👏👏👏
Caralho como é bom ver a formação clássica em ação novamente 😍
🛸🛸
Vcs são os melhores! A banda da minha infância 🖤🥺🎼🍃🇧🇷
Le dan sentido a mí vida. En eso se resume está canción, gracias! 🖤🤘🏼
Red Hot Chili peppers por siempre! ♡
“And China's on the dark side of the moon”
Drum reminds me Californication
ANTHONY IS SO FINE WOW
Frusciante is pure magic. Flea is a true master. Anthony Kiedis remains truly unique. Chad is solid af. And Rick Rubin is the don who glues it together perfectly. The tapestry of it all is one of a kind in this world. The texture of their songs is like a harmony onto itself. One of my favorite bands of all time. Thanks RHCP
Sonunda beee
What a masterpiece. Im glad John fruciante is back.
When I can figure out the second lyrical rhyming line to every verse before it’s been said on my first time listening to this, then you’ve turned into generic rock.
Pure greatness! Welcome back john. Tickets for Phili and met life this summer  can't wait
There was too many invisible ninjas to fight, Anthony had to turn into pirate mode to protect us from them
Descansa en paz Diego Verdaguer.
Not a big supporter of people that have been to Epsteins Island
🔥
I didn't know Will Ferrell could drum like that
Welcome back home John!
It s the best thing happening in the last 2 years!
And China's on the dark side of the moon...
🤩🤩🤩🤟🏻
HOLY SHIT THAT SOLO MADE ME WAVE LIKE THE SEA. MY BODY WANTS MOREEEEEE
yooo
Every time I see Flea I think he could be a perfect Joker
Agora sim!
Oh man, I'm so glad that Fruscianti is back Again with his unique sound!  Amazing song and videoclip   Thank you Peppers ♥️ unlimited Love for You
wait was good.
After all the years and money earned, they could have bought some new guitars 😜. I disagree with the sentiment of some comments. I think the RHCP essence is stale and still sits decades ago from whence it was conceived. I like them, they’ve produced some classics, but they’ve played it safe and continued in that format. Zzzzz
So happy John is back, can't wait to see you guys live.
Frank Zappa?
Never disappointed me! Need your songs and music! Glad to hear John's guitar again. Like this solo!
Gracias eternamente por su exelente musica Red hot 🤘🏼
My lifetime's band, please leave for ever ! love
We were waintig so long Anthony, all of us

The King is back, long live the King.
💯💣🤙🏻
Abril, só vem. ♥ Ansioso para ouvir o álbum.
Please, allow me get old like flea and john, but never NEVER like anthony, dude, wtf
🇧🇷
I Love you John Frusciante ♥️
Anthony, Flea, Jhon and Chad for ever RHCP!!! Thanks for coming back Master Frusciante  :)
Volvieron 🤯
Man, Will Ferrell’s killing it on the drums.
Where’s all the auto correct and the shitty grime music. Thank feck there’s still some bands still around. Never a huge fan of these but always had an album or 2 but still a million times better than the shite that’s on radio these days
ОЧЕНЬ КРУТО
Anthony, Flea, Jhon and Chad for ever RHCP!!! Thanks for coming back  :)
🌶️🇧🇷❤️
Josh was and is a beautiful musician and I think he fit the band in the time without fruciante but John has always been my idol and the moment I heard he was back I was waiting for an album or even a single like this. I heard the riffs and leads and new it was fruciante and felt euphoria overcome me when I saw his face and heard the riff
This is truly awful. The autotune on someone we already knew couldn't singis enough, but his affectations is so bad it's genuinely terrible. I'm not mad at him, instead I'm mad at the three actual musicians in the band that not only signed off on this, but agreed that it should be the lead single on the first album with John since I was in college.
he has an irish accent
They're back :')
I stopped listening for multiple years due to being burnt out. Glad to see they’re coming out with new stuff!
Mais c est l'une des plus belles que j' ai écouter des Red hot. Le son typique est là avec une touche 70 s en prime . Digne d un woodstock
RHCP never disappoints, always legendary.
can't wait for you to meet Rafael Carlier!! (Carlito)
so glad ive got my ticket for manchester this song is amazing cant wait for the new album
Wow, this is the second time Frusciante  brought me back to RHCP.
Anthony looks like he just made weight for a boxing match
Тони как всегда выглядит шикарно, рада, что еще в строю)
Q foda vey😍😍😍
Their music never ages.
Thank you so much 👏👏👏
Glad they’re still using Will Ferrell to stand in for Chad.
Frusciante, going Jimi Hendrix on yo azz. This song is a 90's time warp. That's a good thing.
😍😍😍😍😍
Uno dei gruppo di musicisti ....a me più piaciuti !Adoro il loro Rock ....con note musicali piene di voglia di spensieratezza e travolgente ! Semplicemente fantasiosi è mai banali !❣️🌹🗝️🎸🎸👁️😍
Propaganda enganosa e crime viu TIM
But he didn’t say california 30 times in this song. What’s the deal?
Топчите, ребята!
Inascoltabile.
VENGAN A PERÙ
LOS AMO LOS AMOOOO
I came here because of #Mcflyetcarlito ! love the song, lots of loooove. A pretty babe in the south of France, ofc.
Copiando as coreografias do Z-Maguin do Piauí
any Brazilians listening repeatedly? leave a like
Os caras voltaram com tudo. Greetings from Brazil.
Fans from Thailand. 🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Мужики, скучал, давайте альбом и по пивку
Qui et la grâce a mcfly et Carlito ? 🙋‍♂️
the more i listen the better it gets
John frusciante 💕
What an AMAZING song! Total Jimmy Hendrix/The Doors vibe. Well composed. I could have easily heard Jim Morrison singing this song.
In my idea, red hot peppers is a great agnomen for this guys, because they transfer a lot of energy to us and whenever i feel tired, i search these guy's albums to increase my energy 👏👏👏   https://youtu.be/DSP_m7Vry7U
Why the weird accent? Great track though. Love the peppers with Frusciante.
The evolution of songwriting is truly amazing and beautiful
John is a genius on the guitar im so glad he's back i seem them in 2003 it was epic the by the way tour i have been a fan since 88 👍
Theo von really inspired people to have Mullets
Viva México Flea!!!!!!
Nice they found way back to good sound
No word to describe a John Frustiane  solo in 2022 in a Red Hot Chili Peppers  new album, amazing.
RHCP releases a new song with the whole crew?! A blessing to humanity
Black Summer video comes out in Black History Month.. Coincidence though
Kiedis looks like the Tiger King.
I throw a bottle into the sea, launched from France .. fucking pieces a bomb .... the return of the bosses ... message from a Frenchman ... from elsewhere French youtubers are looking to meet you their names Mac fly and Carlito contacted their team and you will realize a great dream thanx!!!
Great
Weak.
This guys lived the californian dream and survived. And still keep it doin it!
:')
Waitin on another cold winter to end.
No hace faltar que pasen años, esa escencia única e inigualable es asombrosa ... Amo cada canción, melodía y fondos que solo uds profesan en cada vídeo 😌👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ por siempre RHCP en mi ser ❤️⚓
the red (old) chili pepers 🤣🤣🤣
Whata journey; whata jam
Der Schnurrbart ist (noch immer) cringe! aber: Great to have them back!
Good song, but I’ll reserve judgement until I hear some of their newer, funkier stuff.    So good to see John back, and the boys rocking together though!
From Russia with love!
man will farrell did make the band
Thanks for that old good vibe ❤️
The singer keep his body in spiderman-shape for more than ten years, what a determined man.
That guitar solo !
I'M SO GLAD FOR THIS SONG
Anthony channeling his inner cranberry
Dude. Age is just a number, you all prove that you are still have young soul. keep rock & making new songs, ill wait your album
Can't stop listening!
why does Anthony look like the Tiger king? also, glad the sound is back with John
Oh my!! This is amazing to hear on a quiet sunday morning!!! It definitely woke me up!! It's really good to hear this sound again soaking through my soul . Thanks for staying alive!!!! I am grateful to hear this!! Thank you all!!!
Love the guitar, the paint pot , just awesome.
HERMOSO WNN SE ME OLVIDA COMENTARRR
💪🏻👑📀
If a waiter or waitress is waring a Mask I make it a POINT NOT TO TIP them at the end of my meal. Sometimes I will not even pay for the meal and walk out disgusted 😒
A taco bell trip away from no more shirtless videos lol.  And how nice of Will Ferrel to cameo.
¡Qué bien suenan! Joss estaba bien, pero mi impresión con él era que la banda funcionaba en automático, faltaba algo sutil y picante. ¡Ja! El amigo Frusciante llegó para aportar lo suyo, que no es poco, e inspirar las significaciones perdidas en el grupo. Un detalle, John por lo que se ve tenía guardada la ropa en un armario que decía RHCP,¡ el mismo pantalón y camisa de hace 10 años! Un clásico.
Frusciante is Back
this music is not bad
Amazing to see Keanu Reeves on guitar and Will Ferrell on the drums!
evergreen
Anthony gets better and better in singing each time.
Frusciante,  We Missed you
Can't Stop.... listening this!!! I don't know how many times, just want to go with this song flow🌶🌶🌶🌶🔥🎸🎼🎶🎵🎶
Прекрасный трек!!! Несколько дней в голове постоянно играет)))
Awesome!!!! Blows most of todays music out of the water.
Why is he trying to sound Irish?
Is it a Irish folk rock tune with stolen melody from Beatles song, hard day's night?
thanks for the good song my old friends 👋👏👍🤝
I had a really bad day today...I was mindlessly surfing youtube and randomly came across this. IT made me smile! thank you!
Meu amigo eu vou repetir essa música até que ela esteja na retrospectiva do Lucas
Como se nota Frusciante!!
New arrival, lil Irish brother for Desecration Smile

Not sure about the moustache on Anthony 😂

RHCP 💗

Sensacional continua sendo o RedHot independente do tempo o espírito continua da banda Show!
Wow Satanism has taken its toll on these clowns. Dark magicians they are
Did drugs, lost your ways, found them and still remembered us… all of you … still here, still strong,  still authentic, and still beautiful… Thank you for all being here 🙏 💛❤️🖤🤍 Anthony your native heritage and love has meant a lot to us over the years. Thank you.
I can't stand this look on Anthony Kedis but they sound good
I'm waiting for these guys to come to Atlanta 🙏🙏🍻
Fantastic to see the Chili Peppers back and at full strength! John Frusciante is a shaman or something because his guitar is imbued with magic.
RHCP rules. Rock still alive. Love see Fruschiante in group again.
Vengan a Ecuador
te quiero mucho rhcp
Seria un sueño poder verlos en Ecuador algún día. :)  :(
I’ve been waiting! I’ve been waiting!

#WeNeedSouthAmericaTour
How in the world they got will ferrell on drums, jarl varg from the norsemen on bass, Drdisrespect on lead vocals, and a random homeless man on guitar, all to work together, will never be known.
That guitar tone is like a warm hug from an old friend.
Los fanes latinos estamos a full apoyando a los Chili Peppers!
Great job sir...   nice song.  Wyoming, Michigan, USA  Sunday 2/6/2022
I’m not going to hate on Josh, I enjoyed most of his work with the band, particularly The Getaway - But I’m glad John’s back. The balance feels restored.
A Banda q me converteu ao ROCK N ROLL!!! esses caras são fodasticos!!!

i've never been much of a fan but seeing them doing this while staying true to their style approaching their sixties - except for john - is just impressive.
#13 Chile
Suena como rola de metallica de los últimos discos (bleeding me), pero esta bastante bien...
Джон Уик на гитаре? 😁
The sound of the guitar 0:43
that drum fill damn..MV is awesome
*LYRIC*  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the Moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the Sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailing on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Why don't they come out with a banger "we're back" track first then release something slower and moodier like this later? Wonder what the 80s rhcp's would think about what they're doing now?
#4 Argentina
does john has his guitar half step tuned down?
wow they even get a whole summer now?
Sei una leggenda John🖤
que música linda nmrl
Way better production than Dangermouse.  I love how Anthony just decided to do an Irish accent for no reason haha
Resurrected
Perfect!
#12 Paraguay
Kinda sounds like pirate music and i LOVE it!
RHCP - level complited.
2022 and I'm still stuck with this band. I'm glad.
John still got the juice, the whole band stay saucy.
Great! Can’t wait for the album, it’s going to be great surprise for my birthday, that is just a day later!  ❤️
Bem vindos de volta meus amores ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑

Welcome back John, feels like song from Stadium Arcadium!
The best!!!
amazing
This is amazing!
you are still live
Feels like old times again in 2022. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Limp Bizkit & Korn releasing new albums. Thankful to still have my favorite bands rocking out still
Anthony spend shut down lifting weight :)
Rayos, sentí mucha nostalgia  Verlos tan abuelos y manteniendo su fuerza y estilo  Me llevo a los 00's (los escucho desde que estaba bebe allá en el 97) cuando saltaba de los sillones al alocarme escuchando By the way (álbum), Blood, Suggar, Sex Magic, Californication y Stadium En los 10's con ese mágico álbum I'm With You (que en 2015 volvió a tener un impacto fuerte en mi vida)
*Don't forget to support RHCP and John Frusciante on Spotify!*
Tem potencial pra ser a melhor música e clipe de 2022
Que bueno seguir vivo y ver que RHCP saca una nueva musica despues de tanto ❤
Anthony: "Did you get your tickets?" Jim: "To what?" Anthony: "The gun show"  2:35
They are getting older, it's sad. In fact we all are.
Californication is close to the billion v1ews!
Ni si quiera he escuchado la canción y ya le di like a esta obra de arte!!!
This is so racist. #cancelThePeppers
Hearing Frusciante's intro is like the return of a long lost friend. Welcome back, brother.
🔥🔥🔥
Ma men are back, OMG 😍😍 and also welcome back John!!
ETHAN IF YOU SEE THIS, DONT FORGET WHO YOU ARE
Jooooooohnnn
Welcome back John.
se sigue poniendo en loop, se autosustenta
Thank you for continuing to produce beautiful music. Welcome back, John Frusciante.
El vocalista se hizo su corte de pelo a lo piraña. Solo me entenderan los de Perú 😂
D
What's with the Irish accent, Anthony?
Inmortality for this gods!
Excellent!
Nice music the legendery
Nice song guy's 🤟🏻 Love it ❤
I’m glad John is back. Josh was ok but John riffs and rhythms are more memorable.
Unbelievable connections
Just like fine wine...its get better with age
По моему, хрень у ребят получилась
I can feel the gta California vibes again ...ah such a gud feeling thank you rhcp
Se nota que John ha vuelto! Ese sonido de guitarra es SUYO. Enhorabuena! Y gracias desde España.
I am so happy to hear Frusciante back. ❤️
Awesome new song!  That mullet, though...
02:59/03:03 🤔 como o pedestal do microfone voltou para o lugar e ficou de pé depois de ser jogado para o lado? 🤔
Espere dos días para que hoy (mi cumpleaños) pudiera ver este vídeo y llorar seguramente jaja   El mejor regalo, sin duda. Summer of love is comming!
Han vuelto, han vueltooooooo
Can't wait for the rest
👍👍🤝
AYE!!!
I was born, when the band was born Feb '83. Maybe that is why, you'd always have been a red thread throughout my life. I just red your statement about the new record. You were talking about waves. I always write a new years prayer with a drawing. This year I wrote about catching the wave of '22, with 4 abstract figures in the sea on a board. Last Friday morning I woke up with chickenskin all over. Here in Holland the release was in the early morning. I drove to work with a big smile. So thankful you are together again, healthy and making music together. I am 39 now , John left the band when he was my age, I was in my 20's then, now he's back, 13 years later. You're back together. So glad. See you in June. Goffertpark. Bought me and my friends some VIP tickets. Paid a month salary for that. So better be rocking! No just kidding. It is worth everything. You 4 guys gave me so much along the way. There is no penny that ever can replace exactly that! Thank you for riding along with me in life. Unlimited Love for you, always Cynthia XXX
Que música linda.... a melhor formação de todos os tempos do Red Hot Chilli Peppers. O John Frusciante é o cara certo e sempre vai ser
You guys are ageless in every aspect ! 💪
yes yes and? yes.
Take my money
Horrible vocal sound.
Greeat Mr frusciante welcome home
it is fucking joe exotic
It’s good to have some real music with real instruments…. It’s been lost with all this stupid rap nowadays!
They are back wohooo. Also, hoy a guy (John) can change the atmosphere of a band and how this guitar and bass go together, remind me all RHCP. LONG LIFE TO THEM S2!!!
Isn't it amazing that after all this years he still can't sing?
they are old but they are gold!!!!!
Mcfly and Carlito !!!!!!!!
Jon is back 😎
the bass on this track is molten gold and burning rose petals ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Dear Josh,       'Just thinking about you.     I hope you're well and doing good.                       Sincerely,          M
please upload pre- BSSM music videos <3
Will Ferrell got better at the drums I see...
I love RHCP, and I love Anthony,  even if he's rockin Theo Von's haircut 🤣
This album is about to save music culture
que muisica pqp, nunca fui triste com o rchp assim
Saudades dos backvocals do jhon, e a complexidade de um solo simples, chorei lindo!
I'm sorry if I offend all other guitarists that have played with this amazing band but John is by far the best guitar player this band had ever had.
The whole thing sounds like the usual bad producing. The should have gone back to the garage and make a diy album. Warner Bros. Records  :(
Glad to see Vinny from atlantis doing well. Never personally thought a flower shop was the move.
frusciante is everything
When my mom said: "the christ will be back this year" !!! Yeah the Christ is back 🙏 Sir Frusciante
Glad to ser the best Band set together
Porra Caralho!!! Seus motherfockers, we're back bitches!!!
nice one
John's tone...John's tone.
👏👏👏👏❤️❤️🎶🎸🎙️😍
For Mikal  my nefew
Seeeeeeeeeensacionalllllllll
Come on, these men are AMAZING!!! My heart❤️🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Is the way Anthony moves at the final of the video that kills me
Amazing, but Anthony sounds like the aul buck down the pub in Carlow with his pronunciation
You guys are all crazy. This is horrible!
Did they get a new lead singer? Lmao
Whats with the effect on Anthony's voice? very distracting. song sounds good, that vocal effect sucks
McFly&Carlito
Love and kiss from Greece
All these years hasn’t missed a beat this why they’ll be my favourite band ever no question
this is SOOOO GOOD. super impressed, can’t wait to see you guys this summer 🥲❤️🌶
B-Side do By The Way de certeza
❤❤❤
It's not Tom cruise anymore.. it's more to Freddy mercury 😅
vocês são a melhora banda do mundo, sem mais! tá impecável como tudo de vocês 🥺🥺 amo vocês demais! ❤️❤️
The only trending video that I was glad to see
I'm sorry but this is terrible
I just realized whats been missing from RCHP, its John Frusciante backing vocal
After all these years, they still manage to keep that ‘rhcp sound’. Amazing
Love this!
John Frusciante is the GOAT 🐐
Just waiting for this to Hit the #1 spot. #2 right now. On the way up!
zamnn i missed those froosh backing vocals <3
is that a jojo refrence !?!?!?!
El dios de la guitarra ha vuelto...
Will Ferrell still got those drums skills down pat.
For all the hard-core fans out there. Yall see the guitar John is playing. Haha yay! The story behind it makes that guitar apart of this band.
Its been a long time since we had a new peppers jam waiting for another hard monthes to wait for a chillis album to end ! :)
Can't wait for the new album!
Who is that guy with 8 teeth missing 😳
Chorus is great. Verses are decent. What’s up with the fake Irish accent? Someone said it had to do with Anthony’s dad? He was Irish?
If your a drummer than u know what is wrong with the video editing
Fuuuuck maaan🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I missed these guys!! 🥺🥺❤
Y pensar que unos años atrás, no me gustaban. de la mejores bandas qué quedan.
That’s the RHCP I remember and love sow maaaaaaaach!! So happy to see Frusciante doing his magical thing he does.. Every single one of you make such an impact in so many souls lives.. So fucking stocked!! See you all in Colorado, Texas and Nevada!! Hell or high water I will be there!!!!! So much love gratitude and blessings to one of the best bands of my life…  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank  you!! 🙏🏻 🌞❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing <3
This song is a great throwback  But why does Anthony look like Brucie from Family Guy now??
Will Ferrel still got it.
Cielos que macizo!
❤️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️❤️
คิดถึงวงนี้มาก
Ei ciclista cê tá ae? Vc msm que ouve enquanto pedala,lembra de mim?
Wish someone kind enough to tell Anthony to get rid of that black shit under his nose.
FRUSCIANTEEEEE !!!!!!
well i guess i have a reason to stay alive now
eddie guerrero
This is a top top video, I am about to watch it a 3ed time ,just looking and listening to lyrics,  I can't say anything else apart from it looks raw and real ,
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
I just felt like in the  Ratatouille scene when the critic tries the dish and brings it back to the past
Dudes ! Go do a video with french youtubers McFly & Carlito !!!
Gracias por volver John. Eres mi más grande ídolo de todos los tiempos.   LARGA VIDA A LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.  LARGA VIDA A JOHN FRUSCIANTE!!!
Gentlemen, there is one truth. Frusciante has returned, magic is back. :)
Please oh I beg you; shave this moustache.. please, please. The music: I barely recognized it's RHCP...
Danny Trejo looks great in this
Che spettacolo!!!! Magnifica!!!
I still feel disappointed how Josh was kicked out of the band for John to come back, I understand that there is more history and chemistry with John but he had already left them 2 times, he didn't deserve to come back, Josh was doing a very good job, I will continue to love RHCP , but I'm still disappointed with how Josh left...
Ah we back on the nihilistic journey and will Ferrell is back on the drums .
⚘😍⚘😍⚘😍⚘😍
❤️
Scar tissue is back
Great vibes finally something good happening on these cr@ppy days
RHCP en su estado mas puro! Vamos lcdsm!
Eu não sou fã de rock, mas gosto desta banda que nunca perde sua marca nas músicas .
Yessss yess yess! Thank you for this
GEEEENIOOOOS, GEEEENIOS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now i m so happy, Thanks. 🤝
Classy red hot
Thé first song sound so average disapointed a lot sound like reject from old album waiting 10 years then wrting 100 song to keep it 17 no way this sound  liké cover fan band want créate rhp style album lol they faire Josh who was cool  fruciante spit on navarro refuse to play song from one hot minute because hé think ihe IS better doing shit électronique waisting 10 years to give away music who nobody liké expect few sont then empyrien  After 10 years junky hé Can Come Out ne Californication by thé way stadium slane castle  and now listening al lot of music month if covide together then Come Out old loosy face rejected of rejected one more thing Someone Can tell Anthony to cut his ugly moustache then let his hair long or blond stylishe hé look liké thé red neck in easy rider or délivrance thé farmer Bill mc kyney inbred brother if thé album all sont liké that rip rhcp
Let’s go mcfly et Carlito
Som de qualidade, amei. Mas o solo de guitarra do single ficou muito melhor
gold
I can't wait for Justin long to play the lead singer in a movie
The red OLD chillie peppers
What’s with the accent?
this is 2022 or 1950
Its classic sounding in that its very close to Californacation but I cant forgive some of those shanty vocals DURKE side of the moon etc
RHCP reminding us great musicians used to have to know how to play instruments
Сначала показалось, что на басу портрет Ленина, но нет.)))
I'm here because I miss this kind formation! #TeamFrusciante
Volvio Dios
Tiene que llegar a #1 tendencias 🙏🙏🙏🙏 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Gracias por ser siempre mi terapia!! Gracias por su música!!🙌🙌🙌
Really love the fact that old heads still rocking it
3:07  it's so exciting
Dig the track, But those hand moves are just crazy corny ridiculous! New Kids On the Block dance routine level. Much less the cheesy Green-Screen backgrounds they are pasted into. Sorry for the hate,  Turn off the video and just listen to the song. You will have a much better experience.
Amazing!!! Please please please come back to Perú🇵🇪 we love U!!!
Uma lenda ❤✨
Nice john
John Motherfucker Frusciante 👽🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧
Volvió mi existencia x vivir
I love how Anthony casually tells us that he's been working out. Showing his torso and then flexing the guns🔥!
John muthafuckin Frusciante!
Dullsville. If you like what they did 20 years ago, here's another portion for you. But nothing new here to see.
All these years, and the only thing missing was John Frusciante, long live RHCP
Rock and Roll do bom!!!
oh  nice tunes!
I missed you so much thank God that you're making new music again thank God that you got the band back together God bless you guys RHCP

Muy feliz de ver cómo mantienen el estilo que los representa y los hace únicos.
John loves his hendrix sound. For me the best guitarist of his generation.
❤🔥
whats the diference between JOhn and Josh ....
shit just retire for fuck sake
Esto si que es bueno!!!
It would be really cool if there’s some Blood Sugar funk on this album. I won’t hold my breath though
Este nuevo álbum nació con la muerte de la pandemia. Agradezco tener una buena canción con el inicio de esta nueva era 🙌
King is back
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Frusciante is back again with the peppers!!!!!!! Hell yeah!!!!
So nice to hear John’s vibes again. Coming to see you in DC this year baby 👍
They are here, they are clean, I got used to it.
:)
Welcome back John. We missed you ❤️
Holy shit!
No puede creer que aun conserven su esencia. Increíble, los admiro demasiado.

There are very few people I respect as much as I do Mr. Frusciante. And as a collective, nobody beats RHCP in my eyes. All of my love, all of my gratitude, all of my hope for your amazing souls! ❤️
Aaaaah como eu esperei por esse momento, me sinto tão realizado 😍🥰🥰
It's all thanks to John!
The world gone to shit but this band is just as good as always love it
Frusciante is back, yeah!!
✨💣✨
John Frusciante is the best!!!🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Lo mejor... RHCP misma vibra...
Dont like It . Everything has an ending.
Gira por latinoamerica ?
Gira por latinoamerica ?
For being in his 40s Anthony looks pretty good
john being back is great but that doesn’t take away from what josh did. the energy of the band takes on different forms throughout time all essential to the larger mosaic that is rhcp
If you told me this was an unreleased By The Way B-Side I wouldn’t question it for a second, it’s simply amazing how they were able to casually come back 12 years later to their former selves. Fucking spectacular, gets better with every listen.
R.I.P. Diego Verdaguer.
It seems dumbed down. Cool hendrix groove but  Melodically, structurally, harmonically pales in comparison to anything on By the way. There's still a uniqueness to the song which might make it more memorable than I give it credit for atm. but overall the song seems lazy to me. This song had more potential but I don't think was given the time or care.
0 % violencia  0% sexo 100% talento único y amor por la música 🎶
I love that they still sound like RHCP and haven't tried adapting to "whats trending". Their sound is timeless
Proof that RHCP are legends
frusciante's solos touch the soul... it's like going to another dimension
I cry
Sucks that they are most likely part of the secret duckweed crew
Ahhh me recuerda a tener 17
I still remember where I was when I found out that John had quit the band more than 12 years ago.  Is crazy to think it's been so long. I'm so happy that I get to listen to the 4 of them together again. Can't wait to listen to the whole album.
Great song and frusciante is back? Now lets shave that mustache and everything will be fine again.
Gracias por tanto
Me encantan!!! Siempre Chili 🔥🔥
YYYYYYYYEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Que música meus amigos! 🖤
É isso mesmo, pessoal. Eles voltaram ♥️ Que nostalgiaaaa!!!
This song is so good. RHCP legend 🔥🔥
Don’t take this the wrong way but I think the albums going to sound like the B-side of Californication
"Unlimited Love" 2022.04.01
road to 10 milli1on!
The 🌶️ legends are back and they're cooler than EVER. 🦄🔥
Looks like ILM's StageCraft tech was used for the video. Pretty amazing stuff!
Only band I know that can pull off an overlay vocal of discussing the population of the platypus and still have it sound like a completely profound and normal thing to discuss all at once. Actually, in all seriousness, lyrically, if ya dig just a bit, this song's genius. Love this band. Regardless of changes in line up, each and every album and effort, b-sides and hits, no one sounds like them, and when Anthony's vocals are on point live coupled with JF, damn.
Flea 👌!
the mere existence of red hot chilli peppers tells us that god exists, otherwise it would be impossible to have such a perfect band
Brasil2022🇧🇷
I'm here for Flea -  My Mate from Down Under ❤🇦🇺
Red Hot fez parte de minha infância e adolescência. Fico feliz que a formação original voltou. Banda atemporal!
:')
I miss you john 😍😍
They've had some great songs with Josh but something about John and Flea's synchronization makes their songs one of a kind.  I got chills when I heard the backing harmonies. Welcome back, John!
Sensacional!
John is definitely one of the guitar greats
2022 e red hot lançou essa braba, e frusciante voltou também, sinto muito corona agora é seu fim.
Amazing!!!! Love u guys
Copias de si mismos. Fin
Great song.  However the selection of lyrical affect can be distracting.  The pronunciation of dark as “derk” and archer as “ercher” is weird.  When coupled with the Asian themes in the video it seems racist (which I know these guys are NOT).  I also like how Frusciante and Smith are having none of the bafoonery.  We’re just going to rock and Flea wears a kimono and Anthony does his “Glory of Love” crap.
0:44 you hear that john is back❤
yo anthony got ripped
I loved them I love them and will always love them
Isn't amazing that after so many years they keep their essence intact?. This is not easy to do considering today's music market and trends. Thank you guys for being honest and keeping the soul of the band alive and how is supposed to be. We were expecting this and you guys deliver it. ♥♥♥
How i have missed that vibe FUCK thank u guys, we love u
The legend is back
Umm…that’s not good. At some point the shirt of flexing should stop. John is the only one who got the memo of hey you’re over 50 you can evolve.
Man, the Chili Peppers sound as amazing as ever. Josh was great, especially in The Getaway, but there is nothing like having John back in the band.
Anthony's muscles :o
Joe Exotic and RHCP!
Here to say THANK YOU for all these years you stayed with me and guided me through recovery. Your music means so much. JOHN. HES BACK. INCREDIBLE. Way too hyped.
Maldición ........ohhh yeahhhhhh
I've that they stl make rhcp music not trying to change  I love this song rhcp will 4 ever b 1 of my favorite bands
Having Will Ferrell in this music video should help these guys get trending! Weird place for him though since it wasn’t a very funny video 🧐
No esta todo perdido, que bueno !!!!!!
www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Gfs-RunL4
Absolutely incredible! Love this single, can’t wait for the album to come out, and to see them perform in London this summer!! LOVE RHCP! 😝❤️
I think macfly et carlito
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg&t=40s
WOW
Simplesmente foda!
Brilliant
I migliori
Ídolos 🌶🔥🔆
Apparently from what I've heard, Anthony Kiedis is now an Irish Pirate.
THANK YOU RHCP!
Considering these dudes are on the doorsteps of 60 years old they still look and sound great.
<3
🤔🤩
lml
I love that they still sound like RHCP and haven't tried adapting to "whats trending". Their sound is timeless
Seeing John in a music video again genuinely made me tear up. No words can express how happy this makes me
🙃
รู้สึกดีจัง!!
Arrribaaa!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 como si hubiera sido ayer el anterior video, me encantan! Gracias!
RHCP never change plz  🎸
I love that Red Hot create this amazing song about ecology, climate change, and forest fires. We couldn't be happier!
Vida longa aos chili peppers 🌶🌶🌶
i feel desecration smile + Californication  vibes

Im so fucking happy John is back to RHCP!!! And yes, their essence is still untouchable!
La france vous aime <3

Wow, still that classic sound, amazing and btw Will Ferrel on the drums is everything!
aguante los chili pepper la concha de su madreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
🤘  🤘 muito boa 🔥🔥🔥
Hermoso, pero si me duele un poco lo de josh.
Just like everyone else in the comments, Im also surprised by Anthony Kiedis ability to not wear a shirt for 40 years.
some parts seemed off... but when theyre on, theyre the same old band, but new.
Bring me back to 2000s
Эта песня под конец света подходит
Sorry , but I think they need to go back to the studio and try again. I will still listen to your old tunes.  Maybe the woke masses might like this new album...PLEASE TRY AGAIN😐
Los mejores por siempre ❤🤘🤘🤘
What the fuck, this is sooooo cool !! <3  Also Kiedis might be the only guy on earth who can pull off Joe Exotic's haircut and still be hot
I heard rhcp when i was 11 years old and im 26 now still my favorite band. I first heard rhcp from my dad who passed away last september. Dear dad wherever you are right now I'm thankful for the laughs,the sacrifices,the great music and just for being an awesome dad. To all dads out there who loves their kids I  SALUTE you!
Classic RHCP! This is a sweet gift to us fans. Tears of joy streaming down my face.
Quit arguing what the song means Once he says “My Greta weighs a ton”, it’s obvious it’s about climate change  #gretathunberg
Cant believe these guys still releasing music
McFly et Carlito
Mullet Man
❤❤❤❤
Only the best bands maintain their essence intact for so many years
🙂
Reminds me of slow cheetah quite a bunch and thats not a bad thing at all!
isso é essência pura do Red Hot, inacreditável como eles mantem a pegada por mais de 30 anos, lendários!!!
Christ alive they are bad nowadays
Definitivamente es lo que necesitabamos. El regreso de Frusciante ha traído de nuevo ésa frescura a los RHCP
the boys are back 🥲❤
Flea con su poncho de Stadium Arcadium y john en la guitarra, es comovque el tiempo se detuvo... I love this song
Thanks to the @Mcfly & Carlito French YouTube channel for bringing me here. The Red Hot are definitely on the top !

I Love you so RHCP ♥️

After all this years? Forever!
Nice Jazz Bass sound 😍😍😍😍
is the vokalist gay now?
Mcfly and Carlito want to do a game with you
Mcfly and Carlito
Will Ferrell is a great drummer, man. It's so weird, seeing them so much older but I can still see their younger selves in them.
Después de tanto tiempo, volver a verlos juntos es lo más precioso que me ha pasado en mucho tiempo, esto va a marcar una etapa en mi vida, gracias por no dejar de existir y crear este arte, los amo 🌶️💪🏼🇦🇷💖
2 days 5m view..wooww...amazing.. Wlcomeback frusciante...
Qué buena salud física tiene Anthony
Guitar Solo sounds like the 1 of "Time" by Pink Floyd.
Para mí, esos cantidad de soles que se ven en el video, representan la cantidad de días que hemos esperado para que se acabaran las restricciones por la pandemia
классная песня
Thanks again Billy Bob
So glad to have some new chili peppers music. I love listening to these guys, the best in my opinion
Esto es la polla
Ñeh
It's a pity John cannot play his guitar and sing backing vocals at the same time without a false
El regreso más esperado por muchas personas en todo el mundo...me encanta la letra
Suena tan bien, joder *-*
Good to see Will Farrell on the drums
aaaah ♡
RHCP siempre suena a RHCP
Yes let’s goooooo!!!!!
Fuckin Timeless ‼️
I hear flea....\m/
La conjunción perfecta de guitarra bajo bateria y voz....  que sensación tan agradable volver a escuchar melodías creadas por estos genios. RHCP por siempre!! 🌶
Love the lyrics
Glad RHCP ain't afraid of the CCP 🤟🏽
Guys I think I fell in love
A new RHCP classic. John's solo is superb. I love this track!
I'm glad fruits is back
Great to see them back. Unchanged and doing own shit
Ok I'll say it.....wtf are these dumbass lyrics???
Amazing 🤘🏻
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer.
Parabens excelente som, amo a banda, vem para o Brasil por favor
A pegada na bateria do Chad Smith é a mesma vibe de  Californication 2000. Incrível! E o que falar de John Frusciante, hein? Necessário demais. Essa sim é a formação ideal dos PEPPERS ❤️🌶
Song opens: He's back!!!
Wow what a song 🌶
Love this song. We learned it as soon as we heard it. Here's our cover. Check it out. https://youtu.be/oqK0rn5jp80
Sensacional 🖤🤘😎
How many people listening to this right now are for the White House pressuring corporations to censor freedom of speech? Once the government can censure your right to disagree with them our freedom is over. There should be an uprising across all art forms against this madness. Thank you RHCP for understanding this…..
The radio station I was listening to on Friday played this song, I'm like ok it's different, then they replayed it 2 more times in a row, the DJ was on the fence about it, he did say though this is a song were your sitting outside by a fire just chillin.  It has a 60's vibe :P
Fug•in•ayyyyyyyyyyyyy$$$$$$$
everything still the same, the 63’ strat, the checked shirt…
Love is the horse that is carrying us into better times! This song and video has very deep meaning. Thanks Red Hot Chili Peppers for this gem.
This is so disappointing
John's solo signature. Genius lyrics ....!!! Similar to Californication... Amazing job!!
I'm so happy it's unreal. God I missed John so much
Nice title ! pls considere this : https://youtu.be/UVMZl7RyMxg?t=991
❤❤❤❤❤
Aquí escúchando esta joyita con tan solo 20 Años y escuchándolos desde mis 16 😎❤️
Eu Amo esses Guys RHCP Forever 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
So bad!! Bland. Time to hang it up
They bring back good old red hot chili peppers taste my memories fly back to 1990s again i love it
Everytime I play RHCP it just soothes my soul, gives me this certain type of motivation for the day. Like I can do anything I want.
Ahhhh,RHCP!
John Frusciante >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Josh Klinghoffer
Mcfly et Carlito❤
É por isso que o John Frusciante tem que sossegar no Red Hot...
Sound perfect to my ears, congrats RHC... Perfecto🤘🔥🔥🔥
Indonesia
This man lits the whole show
Amazing ❤️
John should never die
This song just accidentally came on and Im like hey a new song. They never disappoints and sexier than ever😍😍💖
Genios!!!!!
Great music :)
Oh my god! This is fantastic. The bass is very good!🤟
Como sempre 💓
"Hear me now!"
quando o john volta o som melhora mil vezes kkkkk

Vuuhu.
chad's entrance at 0.55 omg love it
I'm just in love with this people 😍 Like always, amazing 🔥
As a 90's kid this is so awesome 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤙🏻
we are old but wiser
The same style as always, the same essence. They are simply eternal.
Fodaaaaaaa
We need you to do "Le concours d'anecdotes" with McFly & Carlito 😍
Red jotos chiltepes
Frusciante é o Red Hot e o Red Hot é o Frusciante
Batida inconfundível de californication e guitarra única de John. Obrigado por ter voltado!!
Love these guys
Another story.  John frusciante
I'm not going to ask why Anthony has a mullet. The man can do whatever the fuck he wants.🤣
Total californication vibes, even the sound of the snare, the fuzz, the solos....shivers
will ferrell is crushing those drums
Amazing song. Thanks rhcp
The old funky drummer beat lives on.
Amo essa banda, desde os meus 9 anos
funk legends, rock Icons, still iconic. all hail 'the peppers' for always being true jamming musicians.
The 1991 vids were so much more honest.
Que música não consegui para de ouvir
Even their appearances never changed.   Anthony - Naked John - Long sleeve flannels  Chad - Denims with snapback Flea - anything he feels   Differences but somehow still one of the legendary bands to ever exist.
Thank You 😍☘️🌧️⚜️
LONG LIFE THE RED HOT CHIILI PEPPERS
Que hermoso sonido 💪🔥🔥
This song is animals POV
Alive n still makin music! How cool is that?
VOLVIÓ J.F VOLVIÓ LA MAGIA PAPÁAAAAAA!!!!!!!  🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
Flea the greatest bassist of all time
como sea tengo que ir a verlos en su proxima gira mundial
This music has many parts ready good improvisation and jams...hope to see them playig it live to see their performances!
Thankyou Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary, John Frusciante, Chad Smith and Rick Rubin, this means a lot to me
Amazing
Devil worshipers, all going to hell.
This is so amazing 👏 Glad they're back.
レッチリ最高！日本から愛を
Like si tu también quieres que Kiedis se quite el bigote.
Лучшее что я слышал за свои 40 лет
I'm about to listen to this song for the first time and I'm just betting myself anthony says California once.
It's so good to see John back.
Somehow this song takes me back.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Red hot Chili pepper feat macfly et carlito
Seen this video since it was released, amazed how fast it’s risen in a couple of days hope even more people hear it ❤️ ❤️❤️🇳🇿
The guitar sound its so Hendrix..so cool. I bet it sounds even better live.
Great!
FLEA IS WEARING A TOP ?
Okay, can we all just appreciate this frickin amazingness right here?! I've loved y'all since I was a teenager and here I am 49 years old headbangin' to this awesome song. Yes!!! Keep rockin' 'til the day you die. Love you all so much.  P.S. I would have fallen over and died trying to hoist someone up on my shoulders. 😆
I love this
Here before 1 billion
Amazing song!
Impressao minha ou o RHCP voltaram igual anos 80 fodaaa
Awesome...👏👏👏
Omg this is the first brand new rhcp i've ever watched :D  Do these guys know what aging is?, bc it doesn't seem like they do
สุดยอดตลอดกาล​
STILL THE BEST TO DO IT
THEY BACK ❤❤❤
John frusciante is back
https://youtu.be/UVMZl7RyMxg
Feels like there's some Hendrix in harmony and in licks. And the solo is giving some Gilmour Time vibe
Frusciante came back and just started floating on the track like he never left 🤝💯
Mothers milk was my first album of theirs I bought. Im old..
Que coisa incrível, a vibe única  que isso traz é uma grande paz interior, vc ouvindo sua banda favorita 😍
RHCP the best band of Rock of the World 😎
Let’s gooooooo
Ehh, I'm going to go listen to Uplift Mofo Party Plan so I feel better about my day after this
The one and only group that stick with their own lovely music 😊
Back to the 'Red Hot Blockbuster" (commercial band), Horrible quality standard. Great musicians (instrumentalists too), but minimalist songs for captive the public teen.
Good song glad there still rocking
Great to see Will Ferrell rockin the shit out of those drums!
Awesome
Epic !
Mcfly et Carlito on YouTube :)
Is John back on guitar?
i get bored that sound its the same sound the same chords im surry but thas make me sleep take your headphones and play blood sugar or californication one hot minute
Oh boy this is happening!
Just happy to have Frusciante back in the band.
I loved every bit of it! Too early to say what albums it sounds like but im getting By the Way tones from it. Superb
Listening since forever but a big fan just a few months ago, second favorite after the doors...love them
Hot Damn! 🔥  finally some good music comes out!
La mejor banda del 🌎!!!
Thank god they didn’t go down the pop - radio friendly - money grab road, and continued playing rhcp stuff
A essência da banda sempre foi o guitarrista
So much talent and charisma! I'm a big fan since I was a teenager, back there at the 90's. It's amazing to see how great they were,  are, and for sure continue to be!
I love it and it's SO great to hear John again. Thank you!
isn't john?... yeaahh he is back! RHCPLovers from banten
No hate for Josh, but John being back is 😍
Never thought I'd see the day 😍
Kids these days,     *Will Ferrell?*
De vuelta al inicio ♥️🌌

Im not a Rhcp fan But this song makes me cry when I see this 4 guys reunited again and feel the power in the hard part of this song
Thank god John returned. Again great guitar solos. We have to make up for lost time!
Been a fan most of my life (33yrs young!), they were literally the first band that got me into music, John is the reason I picked up a guitar in my youth, I even share a first and middle name with the guy without the H (heh), but cmon Anthony, was it really necessary to try and sound like a bloody farmer for some of the pronunciations! Great work by them all otherwise, can't wait for the album!
Arrepiou ai ?
Their sounds never age. Its unreal. I believe they still sounds good in the next 20 years
Refreshing to find a band that sticks to its fundamentals! Welcome back!
Esse solo do frusciante bicho pqp ❤😙❤❤❤❤
i am so glad frusciante is back they weren't the same without him
Is there a legal way to download this in Germany in FLAC / CD quality? I don't give a f*ck about 320 kbit/s mp3
Parece uma faixa bônus do disco By The Way. Maravilhoso ❤
Chad Smith is immortal 3:34
You cannot understand how much I need this new album in my life...
Второй день на репите.Силище. RHCP вернулись.
Another beautiful song! We love their classic sound! 👏👏👏🎼🎼🎼
those guys just refuse to stop being RHCP, no matter what. Fans-know-what ink on my forearm is burning with pride after hearing this
Sounds really good indeed, love it.
Thank god, finally new Peppers with John. Sounds good so far.
Welcome back John <3
Feels like nothing changed. This band is immortal.
Jesus christ, Anthony's body at 60 is incredible.
Frusciante s2
Maquina d hits
Me encanta 💖😍
Outstanding.Fell in love straight away!
Why no one mention flea's bassline
Ahh its early 2000 again, lovin it!
Damn Anthony is still fine!
Mcfly et Carlito veulent vous voir
John does everything ❤️
how often you can milk a e minor is astounding
🔥🔥🔥
nós com 20 anos, barrigudo e com papa, enquanto isso, Kiedis aos 69 anos....
Big smile on my face while listening to this. :)
❤️ 06/02/2022
Red hot is like winne How much they get old more good gets!
yep, the chilli peppers are back
Stadium Arcadium meets Californiacation
When I heard that John was getting back together with the band I instantly thought Yes! Did not disappoint, love the smile on their faces, the whole band rocks.
Para o bem dos fãs o Red hot voltou,uma das últimas grandes bandas de todos os tempos ainda em atividade!
E tão bom quando uma banda para de querer inovar e faz o que sempre fez . RHCP raiz 👏✌👊
Holy cow, when did this come out 😐😐🤯
We are lucky kids ❤️🖤
Uhuuuu ❤❤❤👏👏👏
I love how the video brings together elements of iconic other videos, such as Under the Bridge, Around the World and Californication. ❤️
Salam from north borneo Indonesian 🙏🇲🇨🇲🇨
Desde los 9 años escuchándolos!!!!! Os amo siempre ❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Essência continua preservada  , sensacional!
But why this accent ?????
this reminds me of their earlier b-side tracks and i love it
Genial 🤳👍🤘
So tribal so raw...so RHCP.
lets FUCKIKNG GO!!!!!!
do nada pra salvar esse domingo amei
The king is Back.... Frusciante...
Finally , my favourite band with favourite band members creating beautiful music together.
Lendas vivas, em meio ao lixo da música de hoje!!

Thanks for bringing the Pornstache back, it'll be trending again.
Music as it should be..ala Chili Peps style!!! The strains of  John's guitar call to my soul as always.Looking and sounding fabulous  guys.

Thank you guys I have been a fan for so long it's really great to get some new music from you. Thanks again for all your music.🤘
I just didn't understand what does China has to do with the Dark Side???
Will Ferrell killin' it on the drums.
Basta 1 segundo pra notar a falta que Frusciante fazia❤
RHCP still rock
30 years listening to RHCP!!!!! Always Give Away!!!! Like if you too
He’s Baaaaaack!!!
My godiiiiiinhooooo AAAAA É SIMPLESMENTE A MELHOR MÚSICA DE  TODOS OS TEMPOS DO RED HOT 😭❤
So happy to hear that they're dropping a new album, I have all their material and listen to it on a regular basis. When they released The Getaway I was blown away by the sound and originality, they just keep getting better with age. I can't wait to hear the new album!
I love you!  Can't wait for Unlimited Love!!
Muito massa🎶❤
Muito bom 👏👏👏👏👏
O tempo realmente não passa pra eles ❤️

Great song, weird ass video
I cant help myself but smiling when I witness this for the 1st time... Thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers
I lost interest in chillis for a very long time. However.....john is so welcome back, maybe time away is a good thing.
OMG New music of RHCP. Brazil Fans Love It.
Mcfly et Carlito
John looks like John Wick.
🇧🇷
john frusciante back in the band.....best music always written with john, with respect to all the other guitarists, johns a quey song writter for the chilli peppers!!!
Wow, he looks like Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York.
<3
My lord frusciante never fails to amaze me, homies elite. So glad to see them all still healthy and killin shit!?
Tá fodão
Was this video shot with Stagecraft or the "Volume" or whatever it's called? The lighting is interesting.
Where is California 😂
Man, this is so nostalgic and awesome .. only thing missing is the sock on dick
Good to see john 👍
Amo esta banda y este tema está increíble!! Un like por más temas así ❤
Que bom ver meu Red Hot de volta! Esses 4 ❤ Que, apenas, a morte os separem!
🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤
What's ever more amazing is the fact that Will Ferrell stuck round as their drummer, considering his busy acting career!
Hi, do you know McFly and Carlito on YouTube ?
Glad to see john again.its been a long time mate.
I've been waiting for this..its been awhile since we are experiencing this dark side of the moon. Glad to hear this vibe again.

Still singing the same song 20 years later.
Love from jambi, Indonesia... Rhcp ⚡
Get new drummer
Капец имидж конечно, Тарас Бульба:) а когдато тааааким секси казался. Но тело класс и голос на месте🔥
So stoked to buy this album! The moment I heard John Frusciante was coming back I knew it would be great! Awesome cut....
Pot calls kettle black feeling indignit when you get an attack right back see the back of you of ewe. Alice Steele stolen Happy meal keep it real don't peel

Wtf is this shit laziness... Fuck me.
Excelente!!!! 👏🏼✨🇧🇷
after they sell rights to all their songs for 140 mln $, I cannot treat their music seriously..
Une vidéo avec Macfly et Carlito svp :D
Damn, they're back!
Rhcp will always be one of my favorite bands of all time 🔥🤟🙂🤟🤟🤟🤟
До слез! Молодчяги!!! 👍👍👍👍
This brings me so much joy... Perfect, timeless sound.
The return of Frusciante was deeply needed! So glad his golden touch is back. Pumped to listen to RHCP in more than 15 years now!
It's been a long time since I made a new friend, so true.
One word, amazing
This could of came out in the 90’s, 2002 or 2006, their sound is their sound and it’s absolutely perfect!!!!!!! Authentic! I can’t wait to see them live!! Got tickets for Christmas and am ever so grateful!!!
Come backk 🔥🔥🔥
based lyrics?
Que bosta Nunca prestou essa banda
This brings up my 90's vibes back !!.. Well done Ahjussi !!!
Wow they still great
Nice to see John frusciante back in the squad
Fico até de pau duro vendo o John de volta, eu amo essa banda!!!

[Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
#BlackSummer by #RHCP: a list of feelings and sensations during listening  - guitar riff at the beginning: awesome, reminds me of "The Empyrean"'s atmospheres - Kiedis's voice: unmistakable (I love the way he says "alone" and "sun") - "the skies refuse to cry": best song line heard in a long time - Flea and his bass in the forest: wild and amazing, pure energy - John Frusciante's guitar and choruses: elegant and beautiful, the listener feels at home - Chad and his drums: powerful, a guarantee of quality - "It's been a long time since I made a new friend": what better way to describe human condition during coronavirus era? - Flea dancing around with a brush and a paint bucket: WTF? Beautiful - 2:49: oh no the song ends - 2:50: YEAH IT'S NOT FINISHED YET  CONCLUSIONS - music: wonderful "Stadium Arcadium" vibes - video: lovely "Desecration Smile" vibes - lyrics: as always, they are hermetic, nonsense, and hypnotic at the same time  In the end: very grateful for this song which concentrates in itself the energies of the cosmos.
Rhcp brings the best memories from childhood

Dooooood!!! 🙌🏼
Ngl last couple albums were great but felt like there was something missing. Like a dish that was missing a pinch of salt. It’s good to have that dash of salt back.
*Anthony's high school son calls him uncool*   Anthony taking his shirt out: It's show time
crappy song
The best talaga to walang kupas❤️❤️❤️❤️

First time when I saw RHCP was in 1992 at Super channel, "Give it away". Greetings from Ukraine guys : )
You know it's serious business when Anthony takes his shirt out
propre mec
WTF, didn´t know Tiger King joined RHCP
John is home❤✨️✨️
Woha! Can‘t Walt for the Album! An other Level of Guitarsound is back! (and i do love Joshs to) and Flea is allways incredibel! Its time to get a mustace!
Vocês são Foda 💙
Hi, i'm sorry to bother you here, McFly and Carlito (famous youtubers in France) want to make a video with you because Carlito dream about meeting you. They have made a video with E.Macron French Président in anecdotes' trial. So they want the same with you ? If you are interested please contact them trough "McFly et Carlito" channel. A random viewer.
I'm looking forward to this album!
Anecdotes challenge McFly and Carlito on YouTube
This is just amazing
Remember when the radio hits from stadium arcadium were not even the best tracks? I am so hyped for this album after this release!
Sends me to the elsewhere in my heart ❤ what I want and need.
so lame ...no one can ever come up with their own names for songs or bands anymore .
wow Anthony is still so FUCKING FIT  he looks muscular then before lol
Still got that signature RHCP sound 👌🏻💕
wooooooow,  welcome back John!
bao
Vibe RHCP 2000"s! que música gostosa de ouvir ❤️🇧🇷
John!!!!!
Thanks RHCP. My mood of music was come back!
Thank you 🙏♥️
Ahhhh gitar solo nya john bikin gw klimaks
Its been long time... 😍😍😍
Will Ferrell on drums.... Ahha nah sounds sooo nostalgic love it
Партия ударных как в californication
Welcome back, John! Waiting for April 1!
JOHN
Sound like classic
New friends sounds nice 👌
Sorry, this music is whack.   I love the chili peppers, I hope the rest of the album is better. I'm not feeling this.
Have they run out of money?
Fuzz Tone👌
OMG John, how i really miss your voice on RHCP songs..
Какая лажа. Как будто пародию на группу послушал от каких нибудь трибьют-команд средней руки. Кидис со своей хореографией отмахивающегося от фантомов алкаша смешон, попытка казаться молодым - всегда лицемерие. Группу очень любил когда то, но этот трек пустышка, как мин. по музыкальной части.
Where's The Lirycs
Can't wait for the new Album
No band can describe my feelings like they do.. 😊 Nothing better than listening to their new music with my 3 kids. I always hoped to see them live one more time but with my babies.. Dreams come true , we’re going to see them this summer in Nijmegen. And thanks guys for this absolute belter ❤️❤️❤️
Wow! I am loving this new Red Hot Chili Peppers song. And, Red hot Chili Peppers are back. Yeah!! And, Hello from Auckland CBD, New Zealand.
aku simpan komentarku disini buat kenangan” nnti ketika beberapa tahun telah berlalu
From INDONESIA, RHCP Old But GOLD!!! 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Here we are ;D
its so fucking good
Que som top!!!
Gracias! Frusciante por volver!!!🌶️🌶️🌶️
Not a great song.Sounds like they're our of creative juice. And I'm saying this as a huge fan of the band. I understand we're all itching to see them w John again but man.Idk about this one.

amazing yes yes , a song that inspires, from californiacation, it's the return of the Red hot 💪Thank you guys
Is that will feral on drums?
I can’t help but wonder if it’s subtly referencing the Cali wildfires, every time time there was one close by it was practically a black sky summer and the line “the flaming winds” so accurate, it’s probably just me but if it isn’t, I’m glad I nailed it lol  Edit: and also when he says he never knows when it will end, it’s so true there’s been ones close by that last only a week and some that last months
Will Ferrel is fucking good on a drums
they did something together AGAIN ... somethin psychedelic
Gave it a chance. It's just so average.
Glad Will Ferrel still got it
Pretty good
“It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark” …thank you for your ever so awesome music ❤️
Dunno think after californication they started getting samey and bland this is no different!
Now the band feels complete. Funny how one member can have such an impact on their signature sound. Welcome back John Frusciante.
Welcome back, John
👀FRUSCIANTE!? ❤️
He looks like he a newspaper manager who hates spiderman
やっぱかっけーな😆
you still are fire <3 long life to this amazing band
Welcome back John ❤️
Wow it sounds awesome.  John has a gift, he's just so amazing and everything  comes together so well as it always does!  Edit* and his guitar tone sounds freaking awesome!
Jojo reference??
6M d'amis déjà pour vous les RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS  👨‍🎤👩‍🎤 Combien de français ici?🙏🎶✨
Just what we need!! Great to see John again, playing his lovely sound. I am so happy!!
As an 80’s kid, this is just special. Their music, their sound… it still takes me back .
so peaceful
👉 https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCy6p8krDY33mDRMt19YrlXg
Love it!
And Still people thinks Billie eilish songs are dope😂
they need a polo g featuring
This is absolutely amazing. So thrilled for John to be back and can't wait for the Full album to release
Mc fly et carlito vous attendent !!!!
Josh who?
Where fruciante ??
"i cant stop" to watch it again and again!
Oh John I’ve missed that sound!!!
https://youtu.be/UVMZl7RyMxg
Yawn
Chuck Norris?
0:36 What is the dirk side of the moon?               Just kidding! Love the song xD
Riding on Hitler's horse to make a trip wtf😆
Y así es como una banda se hace legendaria, dios siguen teniendo la misma fuerza!!!  Red Hot sois muy grandes!!!!!
Awesome shit. The singer as usual looks like he is blowing for dime bags😆 the comedy is there as it always been. Timeless.
low key warning us about CHINA invading USA. just saying ww3 right around the corner fams in america and we wont win this time..
Sounds like their trying to hard.  The whole thing is very slick and  to much of a reason why I listened to it once and didn't have that feeling of man  that was great.  That's the problem  look at Taylor Swift she could sing about  doing her laundry and it would stick in your head! Peace
And everything is right in the world again. Great first track, very excited for the album and to see you four again live soon!
please meet mcfly and Carlito !!!!!
They still got it 🖤
https://youtu.be/UVMZl7RyMxg
Finally they come back again! John's backs are just a trade mark.
Carlito
👍❤
Qui est la après la vidéo de Mcfly et carlito ?
🔥🔥🔥
realy back to the roots :) great stuff
Pensé que Anthony era Diego verdager
Please keep making music....please keep making music!!!!! I would like to see a Red hot chili peppers Ft citizen cope....what do you think?
VIVE MC FLY ET CARLITO
I hope the rest of the album is better.
Wow  The visuals. So sick !
The album...give it to me NOW!!!
I think i was expecting more from John. Nice song but i probably won t find myself jamming to it...
#missionredhot
Amazing
🍃👀🍃
How come he's singing like the swedish chef from Woody woodpecker
Hell yahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Carajo! Esto es lo que necesitaba, larga vida a los Red hot chili peppers, una gran banda que conserva sus matices aún en estos tiempos, realmente lo aprecio.
So good to hear Frusciante back in the fold. 👍👍
Bentornato Frusciante!!
Uncle Rico
RHCP con John Frusciante 💜simplemente increible.
Amazing as always! Thanks to the universe that John is back!
Auto tune…. 😩  Producers have killed the RHCP mojo.   One Hot Minute is their pinnacle…pure unadulterated expression.
A small piece of memories of a world that no longer exists. Thank you guys.
Will Ferrell is my favourite drummer
I have waited patiently since Californication & the rest...for about two decades. Welcome back Champions, what a statement. CJ OG>
- Lendas não morrem! Seja bem vindoooo John Frusciantee, amamos você aqui dividindo essa dor com a gentee! Thank you ❤️🌶️
🌟🙋‍♂️🎸The True Line - Up 🌟🌟🌟
And still... 🤴🤴🤴🤴🔴🔥🌶️
Перцы реально не стареют!
Classic Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Flea wearing the same kind of clothes as the video of Desecration Smile!
Thank you guys. Just thank you. Your art resonates with the zeitgeist. We feel it guys! See you in London - Jason.
Les red hot comme ont les aime génial merci les gars
I'm so happy there is a new album coming up.
I love it!!!
Anthem.
wanna hear more from the album but this is pretty damn good. psyched thought they retired???
this is trash.
Will Ferrell still killin it
Setting the vibe since 1983, and having John back feels so right.
aight imma bout to cry
Muito suave
Mcfly et Carlito
Como sempre super top,  perfeito!
Faith in music restored. Absolute FIRE!
it's cool 🤟
Glad to see they're back in full swing. Their song had stand the test of time. I just could not help but notice Chad is beggining to look like Will Ferrell, the similarities is so uncanny heh.
⚡⚡⚡⚡🎧⚡⚡⚡⚡
Is he like Irish now? what is that accent?
John is indestructible... BTW, nice shred
F%#k yeah Welcome back Best band EVER
John is back?
YESSSSSSS
Mcfly and carlito!!!
Their flow is insane
Fucking amazing. Nice have fruciante back.
I Love You, red hot chille Peppers
No soy especialmente fan de este grupo, aunque me gusta. Pero les felicito porque a pesar de los años que llevan mantienen su esencia y no se han dejado llevar por lo fácil y que vende más. Y eso es perfecto
🔥 ❤️
Why is he singing like that
Unsure about best ever, but something is a hell of a lot better than nothing concerning rock and roll theses post millennial days!!!
Frusciante is back!!!
This album is going to be soooo good! UNLIMITED LOVE.
Poor lyrics,  poor melodies...Where's the energy? Unfortunately age influences music,  They're trying to repeate themselves....Let's wait for better songs,  but I doubt about that.
Essa musica ta muito boa Tem uma vibe muito anos 2000's
Forever RHCP! But I miss Josh too
Danny Trejo!!! :)
#RedHotChiliPeppersForever! 🤘
Están De nuevo
WoW! Очень!
🥰🥰🥰🥰I love all songs
Дождались!
This moustache does not suit you Mr
Mcfly & Carlito 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 so happy🔥🔥🔥
เชดดดด ตำนานหวนคืนกลับมาแล้วววว❤️
Flea just vibing 🤙
I miss Josh Klinghoffer !!
One week old and already a classic !
Los amo!
Love this one, i just hope there will be some funky stuff in the album. ❤❤
punisher season 5 looks great
I love Anthony, but that freaky mustache gotta go, man. I mean he looks like a repeated sex offender.
El Rey ha vuelto, larga vida al Rey.
5.6M views for only two days 😎
Vintage peppers
love you guys
RHCP is ON FIRE !!
Уилл Фарелл, Киану Ривз, Чак Норрис и Мэт Деймон записали новый трек, наконец то
My son died ten years ago used to listen this song released the day before yesterday
The fact that this band has been together for 30 years
They create timeless art.
good to have john back to RHCP. this is the RHCP music  i know
Still having difficulty processing that john is actually back. Excited for April 1st.
Anthony still has a great voice, love the music and so glad that they made this.
So much LOVE ❤️
Will Ferrell still got it.
John Frusciante man!
Had goosebumps throughout the whole guitar solo of Fruiscante
Amazing Song ! 🎼🎸
It's great man
i actually didn't know if they could live up to all the hype, but WOAH they did it again, mind blowing, this album is gonna be crazy :)
The line "Cremation takes its piece of your supply" really hits home. My dad departed January 16th due to pulmonary fibrosis from the ventilator and we had him cremated. This song is great it's wonderful to see John back can't wait to hear the rest.
I don't think enough people understand how big this is that John is back playing guitar again, esp with his long battle with heroin...
Still the same energy as before, just fantastic!
I love RHCP <33
Anthony is a chomo
Keren cokkkk
So oldschool sound, its amazing, it is so warm and how to say bluesy, I don't know, keep it up guys  (With respect from Russia)
Love it, but Anthony for the love of all that is holy don't join the trend of trying to bring the mullet back 🤢🤮
😍
always thank you, RHCP
This song is so catchy listening to it every day, appreciate everything Josh has done with the chilis and for his creativity with the band, John is back and I've missed him, I remember the day he left the band for the second time and now he's back and he sounds just as amazing as I remember. 💜
i love dissssssssssss
Ese maldito solo
We have missed you John!!!
Didn't know will ferrel and borat played together in a band
Энтони! Дорогой и Любимый мне , как  и миллионам Землян , почитающих твой талант ❤! Спасибо тебе огромное, что пройдя через все трудности жизни ты сохранил себя, отличную физическую форму и, безусловно, свой неповторимый голос❤🙏 RHCP- THE BEST!❤❤❤
RHCP never lose it! 👨‍🦯👨‍🦼🚫
I thought this is cobra Kai

Hey this kinda sounds like the red hot chili peppers 🌶 😋
Wait, is it 90s or 20s?
As a fan for over 25 years I am so grateful these  guys continue to produce such quality. They look sharp, they sound great and.... I'm still addicted to the shindig and hope that they can soon head all around the world, or at least Australia!
I thought as they grow older, they're finished. But what a comeback! The magic, the aura, their essence remained the same...and Frusciante played like he never left the band ever!.
Once a great band but this is just average at best..I don't need too listen too this again
Fuck yeah. I followed John in his solo albums and his growth from those screams in this. I was getting Empyrean vibes so much in that solo.
Am i dreaming this is real rhcp
Like they never skipped a beat
Прям кайфанул! Спасибо
Yeah RHCP forever saludos desde Guayaquil - Ecuador los amo.
TOP!
Somethings never change and those are the best ones, thats exactly RHCP proved  yet again🥰
A jhon Frusciante soul
0.50 i didnt know keanu Reeves was in the RHCP
So stoked! Such a groovy jam. That guitar sounds lit 🔥
Rock will never die!
song ist ok...but..YES...frusciante! :-)
Love you guys
Great, my love
Thank you RHCP for simply being u guys!!! Legends
Great to see that Will Ferrell is still a monster on the kit in 2022.
RHCP for life  But serious question, has Anthony been staying in Ireland?? Kinda had a little Irish twang in the first bit of this song, way diff from his life long California accent I’m used to hearing.. Anyway another badass RHCP masterpiece for the books. Hope all is well ✌🏼
Great music but isn't this a jojo reference???
This song is about the Floydian riots
Always Amazing 💙
С возвращением, Джон 😉
La mejor banda de la historia para mí!. ♥️🙏🥲 Ojalá haya próximos conciertos en Guadalajara, Jalisco, México. ! Bendiciones.
I thought RHCP were retired, nice to see they're still making music.
Lol he comes back looking like the tiger King 🤴
Phoned in
Freaky Styley? More like HIPPIE TRIPPIE!!
This is a band that's not content to retire on its greatest hits- best single in years.
Loose the pedo hair on your lip Tony. Great tune.
I love flea 🤟👍and all too ❤
RHCP IS BACK ROCK NEVER DIE 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sin duda es lo mejor de lo que me he enterado en el día
Frusciante wow
The most impressive part about this is that Anthony was able to keep his shirt on for a full minute and a half.
Bentornato John.. BRIVIDI ❤️
Wonderful!!
WILL FERRELL  What a group of  Fabulous Androgynous Guys Singing!
🔥 Ностальгия накатила, вернули на двадцать лет назад
Red Hot siempre serán los mejores ... 💪
Grande Verdaguer dejando huella antes de partir
sucks
Antony goes really high with his voice great singer
The chillis should have stopped at Californication. They ceased to be "essential" at One Hot Minute.  "LiL'JpD."
😍Most Beautiful Chest Circumference Ever😍 Welcome Back RHCP!
What's with the Irish accent? Is there a reason for it?
Aw Gawd ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Se nota muy fresco este sonido😎
Oh my teenage years welcome back
Is this a jojos reference?
Потрясающе, плачу. Это ведь я тоже старею (
Didn’t they write this song already 20 years ago? Sounds right off of Californication. I expected more
Ça me rappelle un peu u2
AGORA SIM, TUDO NO SEU DEVIDO LUGAR...
Good to see my Brock Lesnar, Will Ferrell, Dave Grohl, and Freddie Mercury making music together. What a supergroup
Their shit all sounds the same lol
can't wait for the new album.
They're still H O T
The song is fantastic 👌
Amazing rhcp 🤟
Y yo que pensé que Diego Verdaguer ya estaba en otro plano 👌🏼
Genious ! John is back HOME !! Dying to get the new album in april ********
Wow rhcp with John is really the best music group in the world.. So amazing to listen a new big after son many years, the magic is always here and I really enjoy To listen the next album, it will the next step since stadium arcadium, thank you guys for the work and the happiness you give us, I m a fan for 1996 and I play bass and guitar because of you🙏long life to red hot chili peppers and Rick rubin... God bless you
🥺
Welcome to chilis
PURA NOSTALGIA,GRACIAS FRUSCIANTE
THANKS 🖤
Фуршанте нагулялся
..love these lads. Great band. ICONS.  Real.
The multiple suns are cool! We do have more than 1 sun.  🙂
More I need more
It sounds like classic RHCP right there, and I like it. The solo was mind-blowing. I'm glad John is back!!
This is impeccably mixed. Do you all realize just how good this song sounds sonically speaking?
Amoooooo🥰
聴いていて懐かしさを感じる。けど単に昔の焼き直しではなくちゃんとカッコいい。凄い。
That mustache is cringe AF!
RHCP changed my life forever ❤️ love u guys 🤘🏼🤘🏼
I cannot get over how good this is!
😍😍😍😍 made my day
2 things I miss from RHCP. John’s guitar solos and John’s backing vocals.
Wow there old and still sound great
Let me comment now while this song is still new, as a marker that I was here. Long live the Peppers!
That feels..
개좋아
Welcome Mr. Frusciante!
🌶🇧🇷🙌🏻
CANT WAIT FOR THE ALBUM TO COME OUT
Fun fact: Their first album was in 1984. They have been a band for 38 years now.
WHAAAATTTTTTTTT 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
John frusciante ✨🥰😱
Saludos desde Lima - Perú
No puede creer que aun conserven su esencia. Increíble, los admiro demasiado.
Solo diré: Gracias por seguir componiendo más temas.
❤️Happiness
MY INSPIRING BAND IN MULTIVERSE FOREVER EVER AFTER
Another gem!
This what I yearn fo🎶🎶🎶
30 years ago they burned their brains out..of course they are trying to recapture the moment
Verdaguer te vamos a extrañar amigo!
Brasil 2022 amo essa música pra minha play lista
My all time favorite band.. their music is so pure.. Happy to see them after ages.
4 leyendas de la musica rock 🎶
This is what happens to a band when they become too self indulgent. You start singing in different accents and shit
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Absolutely beautiful.
My favorite guitar player!
hearing them together brings me waves of euphoria and tears of joy ✨💛🎶
So awesome to feel that old sound and vibe, Kiedis shirtless and ringmaster look, Flea bouncing, Frusciante rift, and Smith. These guys continue to produce!
Still with the him passion🙏🙏🙏
I waited for this since they announced John was going to come back. And this track literally made me cry, when I heard it yesterday.
I am writing a comment right now with my right thumb. Most people are right-handed so I am not so special because I am not left-handed.
This sounds like classic RHCP!! it’s like they picked up right where they left off 🥲
Fodaaaaaa
This song could fit right into Stadium Arcadium album
You know anything with John frucante is going to be good
Thank you, this gives me hope ❤❤❤
Still, RHCP, the same energy, the same vibe, still the music we need and love. Love it, it made my day actually.
А я не разделяю общего восторга. Восемь раз прослушал, вот чего то не хватает, какой то изюминки чтоб зацепило. Для сравнения вчера на работе два раза прогнал Stadium Arcadium. Но все же верю что новый альбом не разочарует.
Yeah!!!!!!
Is that John Wick  playing guitar? ...
Yo tambien los he estado esperando!! 🤘🎸
The boys are definitely back
Wow
It's amazing how they can make a record that is classic Rhcp, but still very current end evolved. I'm loving this track and can't wait for the album
🔥
There’s no band in this entire world that makes me feel like RHCP does, thank you so much for this 🖤 thank you for keeping the soul of this band alive
Damn.. Baru tau jhon kembali.. Apakah josh kembali jadi additional?
Timeless 🤘🔥
I thought joe was still in jail.
Sounds like"  other side"
Great song! I still think you should shave the pedo moustache Anthony.
I knew I missed you, but only after listening to your first song together in 15 years - I understand how much. Welcome back John <3
Keanu Reeves on guitar
Temazo :'3
Great band . . All members, but as a guitar player I can't help but hear Frusciante just play at the top of his game.
we love you guys...
Welcome back,John!!! I'm wait for you!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jeez, put him in leather and he'd look like the love child of Iggy Pop and Rob Halford LOL I always preferred RHCP as a slower band. :-)
Joe Exotic joined RCHP! And they still sound great.
❤❤❤❤❤
Awesome like always!! You all still have it; but my favorite album is still Californication!! I STILL PLAY IT!!
Sounds actually a bit boring...
Does they do their videos themselves? It’s like Under the bridge.
*guy tripping balls in the desert* "I totally get what this song means!"
Solid! Fan since 2000
Brabo 🙏
Hello, John.
As long as we have the Chili Pepper's we will always feel young!!!
Loved it! My favorite band ❤️❤️
You are a legend, RHCP.
Tiene buena pinta esta canción de adelanto del nuevo disco, parece q será mejor al anterior álbum q fue una decepción.
Always support from Thailand 🇹🇭🇹🇭
Really proud of Eddie Guerrerro's singing carreer
I've even declared (mentally) the new album will include my fantasy world- wish MTV never sold out and we could still watch it.... i LOVE this video- im not even halfway in yet  Yes, it is written a saint was beheaded. And walked his head in hand some miles to a church i think look it up!!! Hit list? I see no one with balls as such yet... way too long for talk- it's for dirty laundry! Thank you for clear signs... we all knew i was rebel leader and btw badass baritone saxophone player in jazz and marching band! I brought the brick house- know what i am saying??? Many songs did not exist without my funk love powa! Oh yeah, chief was a black and a red.... Mm. This end face speaks of dismay like someone's a fool.... we should all be fools... or take whatever it is
Super og.. that fucking hair and Tash has to go.. absolutely love the chili peppers.. Anthony if you're reading this, sort that shit man
Apart from Frusciante this sounds exactly like the music that would please someone who says shit like "no good music has came out since the 90’s and early 00's" or "all misic now sucks". It's like the Stones for Gen X's. Not bringing anything new.
And the KINGS return to slay again.
I'm 100% all in for Mullet Kiedis.  This song is a total ear worm.
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME THE WAY...
California sunshine at its best
Man this song is really good !! I was doubting abou it , but they made it !! it's a hit  !!
Постарели конечно, помню всех молодыми
Love it.
Russia here, peppers is great
Trickfinggah is back
Mm melting my heart for real now.. yes and frozen whale tails i feel right now- i got you titanic? Omg no baby... the archer never has a need to run- not in my kingdom Im on book 14 of Robert Jordan- was only rudely interupted by life changing drama shit for women in a home! Yes? We take our baby(ies), or fur children , to a place where we can actually live without a man's control upon is... this message was drawn out for somebody
This sounds great. Not sure i can get over the weird accent he uses in the verses. But John back is great to hear.
Will Ferrell is such as great drummer
MASTERCLASS.
i wonder how this would sound on californication?
О Мой Б-г!!!! Перцы! ПЕРЧИКИ КЛИП ВЫПУСТИЛИ! ВЫ ЖЕ МОИ ЛАПУШКИ! 😍 😇
buenaa!! ustedes los red hot! son unos cracks!!! se mantienen haciendo buena musica! saludos desde Perú. ;)
Wait... Will Farrell on the drums? They switched places for sure on this one.  😆
Fuckin' fantastic! 🎸 🤘
I've been waiting....I've been waiting.....waiting for Frusciante to play with Chilis again!! God bless Frusciante and his fantastic, fuzzy Fender Stratocaster. I was worried there (for about 15 years) whether I'd ever hear another new, burnin' guitar solo!.
Atleast they make real music vs the bs today
⚡️⚡️⚡️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  the flow is there now and forever LOVE YOU RHCP
Glad to see you again on RHCP John mtf FRUSCIANTE!!!!! AMAZING
ITS MAGICALLY DELICIOUS !
🍀🍀
ตำนาน 🔥🌶️
I want to get to that level with the real ones
Growing up with them always making great music!!
Que chingones son los red hot😘😘
Frusciante is back. What a time to be living in.
All I can think about during the verses is: "Who stole me lucky charms!"
https://youtu.be/YIzl-s-mWO8
Imagine its not the best song from new album!
Josh was great, and I'm sorry he was let go the way the band did it, but goddamn hearing John's guitar is just so good an unreal. The way his style blends with Flea is just amazing and unbelievable.
We love you
eu gostei bastante do som 💜
His vocal sounds actually like chinese egg man
fire
John’s right back where he belongs.
Sold your Soul to the Devil.. we will get you all :)
Ty Guys!
Is that hector bellerin?
very disturbing song if you know what im talking
I don't like the guitar solo :) but love the song
Frusciante's fruition is palatable
😭😭 crying tears of pure joy! My boys are back! 😁 Frusciante is back! 👏 I've waited so long for this. Love the sound, it's going to be a great album. 😍 RCHP Forever!
Daqui a anos vou poder contar pros meus netos que assisti esse clipe na noite que ele foi lançado (espero que eles curtam RHCP tanto quanto eu)
Anthony, is that autotune man?
Diego Verdaguer 😃
This guys are Real rocker , Band members are still Together and Still rocking. Thanks Guys for keeping rock music Alive ❤️😢
They are so old, but yeah, Frusciante is working that strat and the boys still have a nice groove.  Why not keep going?
❤❤❤
Never gets old''🔥🔥
I love you guys, thank you for this♥️♥️♥️
Have to admit  i dint know about john. I heard this solo and instantly knew dude is now up there with my other two favorites. jimi hendrix and jack white
Amo
Última canción de Diego Verdaguer!!! 🥲😅
Perfect song, worth the wait!   Come to Mexico on you tour please!
Estan de vueltaaaa!!!!! <3
This feels and sounds like Red Hot Chili Peppers again finally with John thankfully back.  Anthony Kiedis looks much better with longer hair, so it would be cool if he grew it out again on the sides instead of this mullet thing.
May they never stop.
I love that they still sound like RHCP and haven't tried adapting to "whats trending". Their sound is timeless
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Will Ferrell is a great drummer
VAI TOMAR NO CU!!! QUE MUSICA DO CARALHO!!!! FINALMENTE TEMOS RED HOT DE VOLTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Yeahh, legends already come back
How it’s supposed to be. I didn’t think I was a big “fan” kind of person. But. Seeing JF there....it gave me a good feeling.
долгих лет группе, обожаю ваше творчество.
С возвращением ребят! Вы супер
Thanks to my big brother who introduced the band Rhcp and big thank to RHCP who has accompanied for 20 years  *sorry for my english i'm using gtranslate
Welcome back frusciante ❤️
Is Frusciante back ?
Hello John F
🌶 VIVA LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 🌶   Much needed RHCP music , gracias homies!!
I like what JW is doing ….. way better than the mustache…. But that’s me
& forgot to say good song boys ..your music burns like the sun☀️❤️
RHCP go Irish ?  I love it
Is that a sort of  Leslie speaker effect I hear 😁
It’s so great to see John back in the band! Can’t wait to see you guys in Nashville!
how far they have fallen
Anthony,No. Please rethink that look.
ITS WILL FERRELL 😬😂
Dude i miss this so much omg
Another Good one you Go Red hot chili peppers
mf looks like eddie guerrero now
Welcome back RHCP,Longa vida !!!
Amo vocês 😍😍😍 never disappoint us
Whoever is producing, mixing and mastering your music, give them a raise. The sound is absolutely fantastic....
and china’s on the dark side of the moon???
ole' RHCP but still sounds so fresh in 2022
Great song! It's awesome watch you guys doing music together. I'm honer to be your fan, red hot chili peppers are the best band. This is a masterpiece ❤️👏🌶️
YEOW #1 TRENDING!!
😎😎😎😎😎
Aguanten los RHCP!! Greetings from Chile!!
To em êxtase com essa musica nova❤️
I preferred the one that went 'Put the banana in the apple sauce, why don't you, shamalamadingdong'
I like this
Is the John doing the Bedroom Lick at the beginning of the song after Tony says " Keep it going"?
Holy banger, that's a pretty great guitar solo from this mellow RCHP song.
the videos r the sane vibe.  Musics good too
Gracias John, porque si no era por vos no sería músico en mi vida
Holy crap!! I never knew Will Ferrell could play the drums that good! Actor , comedian , stand up comic AND a great drum player! Keep it up man!
Bruh, Anthony look's straight like Daniel Day Lewis...
日本人で聴いてる人がいたら反応してほしいな〜🇯🇵 I'm a Japanese first year junior high school student. I fell in love with RHCP a few months ago, and I'm excited that this song will be my first new song. I'm sorry if my English is wrong.
日本からです。 以前この4人でライブをした東京ドームで再び逢えることを願っています。 そして、ジョンお帰りなさい。 この４人の生み出される音楽をまた奏でてくれることを嬉しく思っています
Welcome back ...LEGENDS🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🔥🔥
This is a good song by an amazing band...but if Im being completely honest, it just doesn't break new ground. It could have been a B-side to Scar Tissue or something. Still, great performances, particularly by John.
It's a great song, and although I liked Josh I'm happy to see the Dream Team's back together again. But question: What if "the archer" doesn't run but elects to take aim before his pursuers can? Although his fate remains the same, does this not change the narrative and perhaps make it worthy of more song before April fools, when Captain Ahab and his whale might have their last dance?
Jesus is my lover
Why did God create ya,long us
Gracias por este nuevo álbum, por ustedes sigo vivo, ¡MIL GRACIAS! los amo, amo su música y amo su letra 🌶❤
I know what y'all did last summer....
Sir psycho! Will never stop the madness
😩😩🔥
Jojo?!!?
damnn i am old., they look so old.  does this mean i am old?  red hot chili peppers are so old
Song sounds so good guys
mas de lo mismo
Frusciante is back
Frusciante é foda !
if I was from California, I'd want the state flag to have the rhcp and Metallica logos
I think Eddie Vetters coming out with a solo album this week he's the last survivor of Seattle got to hand it to Anthony and flea and I'm sorry if I'm forgetting the other names I'm sure that happens a lot but you guys are the greatest
Flee got Soul......
🔥🔥🔥
Tomara q n seja que nem Los Hermanos, voltando com uma msc apenas😔
Great remembrance of what the pandemic meant and means to one of them... if not to all of us...
So crazy they're talking about Eminem and Dolly Parton going into Detroit this year the peppers always keep it fresh and always keep relevant and always keep the hottest song I don't know how they do it they're enigma
His voice has changed it sounds not the same 😔
Living legend, rhcp forever!
Lo que más me volo la cabeza es el solo de frusciante...!
Didn't like their old stuff. Don't like this.
オトイシアキラ
El
The best 🔥
só eu q achei q o Anthony fez referência ao álbum "dark side of the moon" do pink Floyd?
No disrespect to Klinghoffer; he's a great guitarist and added so much to the peppers' sound, but Frusciante's the soul of this band and always has been. I can tell this album's gonna feel like the follow-up to Stadium Arcadium, just from his riffwork.
Recombobulate
1:52
Top!
Woow  sii!!
These guys aged well
Antony corta esse cabelo pelo amor de deus homem. a música tá maravilhosa como sempre 💖
good song, i knew john came back but i was unaware of the leprechaun getting recruited
John and his iconic stratocaster is fire 🔥🔥🔥
You guys look so old, stay healty tou guys..
“Ooooh vamooo los redhoooo  Vamoooo los redhoooot  “  🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷♥️♥️♥️♥️🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷   #WeWantRHCPinArgentina 🙌🏽✊🏽
Boring AF. Haven’t we heard this before?
JOHN IS BACK BABY!!!!!! I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME!!!
We missed you guys . Please bring those days back .we love you
Diego Verdaguer FOREVER!
Coisa linda!
👍⬆️👍
Long time waiting this moment John is Back.
Really glad to hear you guys haven’t lost your touch. Impressed and excellent solo.
Frusciante único en su estilo,
5.3 million views in 2 days wow
Anthony is looking more and more like White Goodman.
Cerca de la edad de jubilación, y menudo temazo han sacado... 🤘grande los nuevos "abuelos" del rock 🤘
JHON WICK FRUSCIANTE
Will Ferrell's drum groove is really cool :)
Larga vida a los RCHP, aunque aún sigo extrañando a Josh. Pero Jonh es irrepetible. Gods🙇🤧
I love much this band ♥️🖤♥️  Continue  : the next generations..🔥🔥♥️🖤♥️🖤  never die.
Bought my concert ticket today for their new tour
I'm going to like pirate Anthony.
Love the song overall. Maybe a little bit too much pitch correction on Anthony's vocals though, particularly with the verse sections.
Good to see they’re still at it, bringing the goods!
Beautiful solo
5.3 million views in 1 day chili peppers are alive and well
Celebrate the comeback anyway.
Fuck yeah.
se ven muy bien ya an de tener mas de 50 wow larga vida a los redhotchillipepers
Frusciante is  better guitar player in the band!
Possibly the GOAT band
I cannot wait til august. Unbelievable that I’m gonna see them
La esencia sigue intacta, q buen tema…me encanta la idea d saber q aun se puede escuchar buena música en estos tiempos donde vende la música basura y denigrante…RHCP es un poco d lo q necesita el mundo para ser mejor en cuanto a cultura musical…
01:52  Solo Frusciante.... Wow!!!
The term “black summer”, most simply implied, acts as an allegory for the vocalist going through an extended period of depression. And as revealed in the chorus and outro, the thesis sentiment of this piece revolves around his desire for this season to come to an end, even though it doesn’t appear as if its cessation is anywhere in sight.
same vibe nothing new. hate me but it sounds like a rhcp recicled sound
i am excited for the new album by rhcp. their 12th studio album unlimited love. april 1st. i love the 1st single guys  mike fan from canada since 1991 (i was 13 turning 14 that year)
La Banda De Rock que entra en cada espacio de nuestras vidas...R.H.C.P. Is Back
Anthony's hair is the best!!!! Exactly like my uncle 30 yrs ago...Johns solo WoW!!.chads beat and fleas funky always...
Will Ferrell still killin it on the drums
lml
I've listened to this several times now and at first I was so focused on John's guitar parts because it's been so long  since he's played on a chilis album.  I was so distracted by that to notice Flea. FLEA is killing it on the bass in this tune. As always! Shout out Chad too with the sweet groove
This is awesome:'') Me puso medio triste escucharlos después de años jsjsj, gracias por regresar, son asombrosos:))
que emocion la banda completa de nuevo 2022 esta empezando bien 😍😍😍
🔴🔥🌶  peppers
ES HERMOSO! 🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏
Nothing change this vocal, really-really crazy
Y UN DIA VOLVISTE JHON FRUSCIANTE!!.. WELCOME HOME LITTLE BIG BOY!!
Awesome
Cadê os Brasileiros?  ❤🇧🇷
The moustache gotta go though Anthony haha.
Love that Deborah Chow directed this.  Love the song!
0:45 Esta parte suena muy Jimi Hendrix, que buena canción.
But it’s winter?
Perfect song, perfect music, I LOVE RHCP!!!
Best thing that could’ve happened at this point in history. Incredible. 🌶🔥
I like it! WTG!
I thought that was Derek Zoolander
it looks like they raided the set of The Mandalorian to shoot this music video ❤️🤣
Love that one💪
Lindo
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Folks, I've been waiting for this formation for years, DECADES. Now, it's real, the boys are BACK! Long LIVE to RHCP! 🤟🏻🎸
Top demais Red Hot Chili Peppers 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Happy to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing again!
OH MY GOD I WAS NOSTALGIC TO SEE SOMETHING COMING STRAIGHT FROM THE OVEN COMING FROM THE RED HOT! AND WHAT A WONDERFUL SONG!!!
Hell yes!!!!
🇻🇪❤️
0:49 when did Keanu Reeves join the band.  First it was Will Ferrell, now Keanu? Awesome
GO ON JOHNNY LAD....LETS AV IT.... THE BAND TOGETHER..... (the next gig is gonna be huge ...dynamite.."you'll see"
This gives me a bit of a led zeppelin feel. I like it. I've been hearing fans say it's not very RHCP sounding. But nothing really is, since they're known for each album being very original and different from the preceding album. That's part of what we love about them.
Jhon is back
Welcome back John. RHCP together again.
I think at least 1000 views are mine 🥰 It's great to have the boys back together! So excited for this album and seeing them in Seattle in August. That Froosh solo melts my heart ❤️
Shake a thang gurl 😂😂
John F. just belongs with this band!
Nice Irish tune.
HELLO I FROM BRASIL GREAT SONG THIS 😎🙏🇧🇷
Están como los de Maná no cambian siguen igual lo mismo lo mismo.
What's up with the Irish accent?
cant wait to listen to the album
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
5.3 MILLION views in 2 days!!!! ❤✌🙌✌🙌✌❤
<3
The Hendrix's vibes at the beginning are amazing! And then it's pure and good RHCP flow 🔥❤️
Great song! The legend continues and still more alive than ever!🙌🙌🤙
0:43 goosebumps! <3 thats what ive been missing
Will Ferrell on the drums
Finally the guitar is not a muted percussive instrument!
2be honest...its ok..not great.still amazing hearing them 2geather again is the true hit
What follows Black summers?   The Golden Age - By Akira The Don  I woke up today guess I've been away what you gonna do what you gonna say  I don't want to be one of them anyway I knew it from the start just look at what we may I'm stepping into my life and I'm not afraid at all at all cause we believe in us and we believe in love and we know it's about to be a Golden Age It's The Golden Age  I've been in L.A. Grateful for the day I've been to the moon I've been cleaning up my room  I don't want to be one of them anyway I knew it from the start just look at what we may I'm stepping into my life and I'm not afraid at all at all cause we believe in us and we believe in love and we know it's about to be a Golden Age It's The Golden Age  I got all that I need for what I want to do I got all that I need and so do you to do the things that we said we were gonna do  so lets do all of the things  cause we believe in us and we believe in love and we know it's about to be a Golden Age It's The Golden Age
I've never seen someone as successful at two major careers as this man right here, Will Farrel.
BRASIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nunka mueran, por favor
ugh, just retire already.
❤️‍🔥
Frusciante de volta!!! Pode encerrar 2022! Melhor coisa que aconteceu! 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️💪💪
Tenía que regresar 🎸. Ahora si moriré feliz
Still one of the most overrated bands. Garbage
Esto se escucha genial y aún más con el regreso de Frusiante a la banda.
In a sea of shitty music for apple ads this is way less flushable. Keen to hear more
Nossa esse som é a cara do Red Hot Chili Peppers uma sonoridade única!
This is so awful it's hard to to comprehend the entirety of it's lameness
Will Farrell is crazy talented!
Why does he sound different
YES
i miss u
Always love new RHCP song!! Great song by the way too!
I've waited too long for this. Yes!
FRUSCIANTE
For a 59 year old rocker he’s looking pretty awesome for his age. Lovin this tune it’s smooth original and right to their roots.
🤟🏻🖤🌄
UP 👆
Good to see playing them together since the californication music video
Perfect!!! 😍 always exciting to hear new rhcp
These guys have always sucked.  Go back to your junky juice, Keidis.
It makes me pretty happy to see Frusciante with RHCP again, I’m excited for this new album, I hope it’s good.
Oh my god
Que maravilla tenerlos de vuelta!!! Suenan espectacular, como siempre!!! 😎🤘🏼👌🏼
if u are listen this u have culture :)))))))
1*
John Frusciante is God.
Sou fã desses caras a 23 anos e digo esses 4 juntos são demais!
I'm 29 years old now, when I was 5 my mom died because of drugs related problems.I barely knew her but one of the few things i got from her was the cd of blood sugar sex magic.When I was a kid I listened on repeat that cd because it made me feel close to her. When I grew up a little more, I made fantastic memories in a fantastic childhood thanks to my family and friends, and in all of this times the RHCP music was always there, with californication, by the way or stadium arcadium cds. This band has some special meaning to me, where my mom was a huge fan of the beginings of this band and the obscure times, I grew up with their redemption to drugs era. No matter how many years passes, I will always love this band and they will always make me  special things. Thank you for doing this incredible music for all of us, you're fantastic. Cannot wait to hear the whole cd. Thank you once again.
He has no business being so ripped.
so cool song!!!
COME TO BRAZIL ON THE NEXT TOUR
THANK YOU!
Black Summer or Kcalb Remmus?  Jokes aside, glad to see and hear RHCP again! ❤
😍😍😍😍😍😍 welcome back JOHN 😍😍😍😍😍😍 from Indonesia 🇮🇩🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
Son los mejores, su música siempre me alegra los días Saludos desde México!! ❤️🇲🇽🖤🤘
Love it!!! You guys are PURE FIRE TOGETHER!!
존나 멋있네
I got a Jimi Hendrix vibe from it
RHCP is musical evolution and transition, they are defined by not being able to be easily defined. They've always done as they've wished and asked everybody to come along if they wish, it's the same drivers just a different car every time. Keep being true, we'll always find you
U   N   L   I   M   I   T   E   D      S   O   N   G
46 y una de las mejores bandas de mi vida!!
Oh my good!!!! 💙💙💙
¡Queremos a los chili peppers! ¡Queremos a los chili peppers!
chad come back pearl
This is the band that never seems to age. Keidis in particular looks fucking exceptional for his age of 59.
Incredible
What's w the weird accent?
John’s back!!!!!
Mattingly, shave those sideburns!
Los Peppers nunca pierden su esencia 🤘🏼🔥
💪💪💪👍
When it gets to 2.50 regardless of your thoughts on the song....it's THE FUCKING RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:55 John Frusciante amazing solo 🌶️ 16 year later...
I still remember the day they released "Dark Necessities": I was still a student back then, but my love for the RHCP was (and is) so big that I went out the classroom just to listen to their new material. My heart beatin' fast, so many emotions gathered in my heart when that unparalleled bass came out from my headphones... That was six years ago. Now, as an adult, I experienced the same feeling as when I was younger, even more vividly since Frusciante, my all-time favorite musician, is back. My hands were quivering, my expectation was huge... And the RHCP has never disappointed me. This is utterly gorgeous: so fresh and renewing.Kind of reminds me of Quixoticelixer, Strip My Mind... as well of The Sunset Sleeps and How it Ends (though these last two were with Klinghoffer) and, at the same time, it feels so new, with a whole new style. This is what Frusciante needed: to get rid of all those sterile and fruitless musical experiments he's been doin' for almost a whole decade. And don't misinterpret me: Frusciante's the musician I admire the most in the whole world, and I love several of the songs he wrote in the last years, but he had lost his essence and enthusiasm. He needed to recover his very musical roots, playing again with his old fellas, the RHCP, and playing that guitar the way only he knows how to do it <3 So glad to see my four favorite "cabrones" back <3
i love u guys so much
Alright, alright, alright (in Mathew mcconaughey voice)😎
🌶️🔥❤️
🧐🍷
kiedis looks likes young mamoremo paez
El mejor regreso♥
❤️
What's going on with Anthony's hair? That style is not him.
RHCP have inspired so many bands over the years, you have no choice but to respect them.
I've been waiting SO long to hear this new music with John back. No disrespect to Josh, but John's playing is so recognizable and the solo in this song is one of his sickest ever. It's basic, but so tasty. God damn! Chilis are back!!
SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK, JOHN <3
John Frusciante voltou❤
Amo amo❤
💖💖💖💖
Long wait is over Anthony Flea John Chad.. new vibe...🤘❤
Amo!!❤️🇧🇷
I loved it! MUSIC!
Feeling this tune great to see the guys back together! 🌶🌶🌶
Cade a galera do brasill ???
No tiene nada nuevo la canción, nada fresco, es más cierro los ojos y es la copia de this is the place :/, ya no existe el sonido filoso de la strato :/
Black Summer Lyrics: A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end  It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Los amo 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Kaka regueton ....shes die regueton👎👎👎
30 years ago I almost left my life Under a bridge, Red Hot was and have been part of my life soundtrack since then, thank you!!!
sounds like its off Stadium Arcadium
Cant wait for the full album
Fucking incredible
Ah. Chili Peppers with auto tune. Weird.
I'm happy again.
Anthony keidis is such a tool
I love that guitar sound in the beginning so chill nice job chili Peppers 🌶
John frusciante
#frusciante = Red Hot Chilli Peppers
So much better than so called BTS with lipsticks nowadays. This is music.
Chad plays the same drumbit in every single song...
simply magnificent, always maintaining his style and a plus is john wick on guitar.
Shoulda released this on Funny or Die Will. :P
JOHNS SOLO MAKES ME SO HAPPY
the first version was way better 💀😖 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yrGR11TDRYM&t=32s
Not a huge fan but do like their all their radio hits. And as a Californian just by default support RHCP. But that last album sounded lost. This. This is them whole again.
The wizard of queens is back
Flea. Fully clothed for nearly 4 mins. It was probably the longest 4 mins in his life.
Dice "Tendencia #12 en música" en Uruguay.  Debería ser #5 como mínimo.
Welcome home Johnny. 🌞🌞🌞🌶🌶🌶🌶
RHCP🔥🔥🔥 🇵🇭
Yeeeah!👍👍👍
Im speechless !!! 🙌🙌🙌
Vibrando com a voltar da banda , gosto do fato do Antony ter um gosto diferenciado mais agora ele se superou com esse cabelo ele esta parecendo um cacique veio ta parecendo muito o filho dele rs mas fico feliz pela volta do Jonh  o som da ora. Longevidade aos caras
BRASIL
Love the song 🎵 you guy keep on Mac king the goods 😎
🔥💥🤯🔥
Why does he sound like weird al
Não posso deixar de comentar algo aqui, pois sei que isso vai ficar pra história.. viver e presenciar esse momento, só pra poucos. Bem vindo novamente Frusciante!
Jesus fucking christ
Is it a good bye?
should do a song with Bone Thugs N Harmony!
The Irish accent is ummm uhhhh... a thing.
I will never not see Will Ferrell on drums.
Welcome back john! You are my hero, sempre avanti!
John frusciantes back in action yall!
I've been waiting for John
Cool song, Anthony needs to ditch the molestache for sure though, not a good look for him.
🌶️❤️‍🔥
No sé porque siento que es una mezcla de varias canciones de ellos y de otros artistas volcados en un solo track.
Mto Top!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Loved it! Been waiting a long time
Wow this is hot garbage.
FUZZciante
2:50 = happiness
Qué momento para estar vivo
Love ❤️
Guess who's back! Guess who's f*#%ing back!! God bless ya, Mr. Frusciante!
It's hard to choose words to put here. These guys are everything to me. I didn't hear the song as soon as it came out, I prepared myself first. It's not that I didn't like Josh, but here, we have guitar, even the drums seem to have come to the fore. The By the Way vibe came back a little bit mixed with Stadium Arcadium. Finally let's get out of the ambient music and become ROCK again hehehe there's a person who, if he hasn't heard this song, I know he will, so ROB HAZEL, if you read this, know that i didn't forget you and never did anything you said, so as long RHCP last,  I'll search for you, my dearest friend, if even you hate me, even if its the last thing I'll do in my life.
Foda dms
So fucking good
0:45 Eminem?
Los amo  35 anos  ,,,
Bendito seas John, bienvenido a tu hogar RHCP!
This sounds great and doesn't disappoint. A great mixture of Californication and Stadium Arcadium. I hope the whole album sounds as amazing as this one
New californication ..john is back love it
me pregunto, existirá gente a quien no le fascine esta banda?

My light of fading and I posted yesterday that it was nice to get to hear this song. And they deleted the post meaning all their talk of love would appear to just be a sales gimmick.
RHCP FOREVER ❗❗❗❗❗
Canta bien el carnal de Verdaguer 😁
This is just DELICIOUS
Volvieron los grandes 🔥
come to brazil now!!!!! 🇧🇷
I don't have anything against artists finding new sounds and trying to make music that adjusts the mainstream, but is very clear when an artist is faithful to their sound style and essence,  when the main objective fo song goes beyond money and reproductions. Of course, money is important,  after all, music is a business,  but when I listen to a group like theis, I have a feeling that this music is genuine and these people really understand who they are. Something that I think some famous bands lose over the time when they have several years in the industry.  Great song!
Que buena rola
Oh man this soothes the soul, so good to have the group back together again. It’s magical
GRACIAS DIOS POR CREAR A FRUSCI Y A LOS RH VAMOS CARAJOOOO VENGAN A ARGENTINA POR FAVOR
The more I listen, the more I love it! It just keeps growing on me, so much soul!
Tiene que durar 15 minutos
damn another hit by rhcp
YEEEEEEEEEES
I love how much personality is in Anthony's vocals. The way he enunciates certain words (like 'sailor' and 'dark'), and throws in little a 'get it on' in between lines. 🔥
This has the by the way all over it, and im SO FUCKING PUMPED FOR IT, RHCP SEE YOU AT WEMBLEY 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Whatta banger🔥🔥🔥🔥
beautiful, rhcp they never stop impressing me!
🤘🤘❤
For me, John came back right at the right time. Love and respect Josh so much too, but John is the sound I fell in love with growing up. This song made me cry cuz the comforting nostalgic sounds of John’s guitar/vocals are filling my ears at a time when it’s really needed. We’re all tired, and he’s here for us again
Cheers from Indonesia country 🇮🇩
Quem ja abriu o video pra ver o john???
Gracias por hacer música 🙏🏻
Con  el ingreso de jhon fruciante esta banda es la mejor y la canción es hermosa
Approaching 100m views
I really miss u so much 🥲🥲 thank you
I listened twice, I like it.  👍👍👍👍👍
Anthony Kiedis still as ripped as he was twenty years ago!
This is a hit for sure
Bravísimo!!! Larga vida a los RHCP. 👏👏👏👏👏🐐
They  are  so  cool  great  song
There's nothing wrong here, it may not be groundbreaking for them but it's still solid with all their other work. I do hope there will be more unexpected hits in the other 16 tracks
JOHN FRUSCIANTE ❤🎸⚡
Why’s Anthony’s pronunciation so weird?
Irish vibes I like it
Nice one!!! <3
The best band ever to maintain their genre and vibe. The instruments playing felt so nostalgic. Love this band.
They look old but their music is forever young
Cool!
SIMPLESMENTE FODA!
60 is the new 30.
Can’t stop listening to this song 🤘🏻
Welcome back, RHCP!
Good trend. Positive.
Frusciante lml
The sound of blues, the sound of heart and soul, This new RHCP is absolutely gorgeous!!🌶🥵🎸
Que feliz me hizo verlos juntos
los amoooooooooooo
Перцам всегда палец вверх!
I miss the funky rock music they used to make but will always love these guys. Not sure what's up with the weird accent.

They can not finish to write songs for By the way album. Pity so much. 20 years of stuck.
😁💥💥💣
Glad that making some dope shit in 2022.
Ya me canse de la musica latina, gracias por regresar a traer las buenas vibras ❤️‍🔥
We got some Californication feels in here. Let's go!
It's been a while since I heard Red Hot, I like it, I don't know why I stopped listening those amazing songs.
Omfg they look great what r they  vampires or sum
Mulet e bigode, creindeuspai.
Carries on from the other albums vibe.  What is hiding behind the sun? Interesting video of The Sun.
0:55 When the hell did Will Ferrel join? I know he's a pretty kick ass drummer but I never knew.
is this a Saturday Night Live skit

FINALLY
What a blessing to us,thank you for coming back John
Man, this is so chilling and uplifting. I can feel their early 2000's vibe again listening to this.
As good as the music is, I really love the casualness of the video.  Reminds me of the first generation of MTV videos back in the 80s, no real story being told, just visual symbology.
ORIGINAL Line Up! 🤘
Uuuuuuuhhhhh,tremendo,la química intacta👌👌👌👌
Black Summer
Black Summer
Black Summer
Black Summer
Black Summer
They had me going for a second there.   Actually thought he might keep his shirt on all video! Lmao
Wow!
❤🇰🇷❤🇰🇷❤🇰🇷
Music does not get better than this
Anyone distracted by Anthony’s accent? Good song, but his pronunciation on a few words during the song is… interesting?
This song reminds me the style of stadium arcadium, it's so amazing they back
🔥🤘
Hola soy colombiano y esta canción me parece lo maximo
Mesma essencia, tri pra caralho!
I just started to cry when i hear the solo for the first time. I can’t explain the feelings but THEY ARE BACK!
LOVE IT!!!!!
its nice that Keanu Reeves is their new guitarist.
o mestre voltou!
Alguien más se acordo de la canción del condor vuela?
Композиция просто шикарная! Наконец золотой состав снова вместе. Жду новую пластинку)
isso ta muito bom mds
Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно!
mi mama me cuenta que desde que tenia 3 años siempre le pedia que pusiera cant stop y californication, ahora tengo 17 años y es la misma emocion de como cuando tenia 3 años <3
Охуенно!
John es lo mejor que le pudo pasar a los peppers 👍
It makes my heart happy to see John back playing with the Peppers. Some of my fondest memories tied to music are his playing on BSSM and then Californication, Stadium Arcadium. I hope he’s in a good happy place in life and the music feels right, and like he’s at home once again. Missed you guys, I really did. 😌👍🏻
I love this.Welcome back guys.
A Red Hot Chili Peppers music video without AK with no shirt is not a RHCP music video
Yes new chilli music 👌
Wish they'd get their fire back...
Bravo!
When you got the magic chemistry, you got it.
Will Ferrell is seriously so underrated 🤗
F**k!! En comienzo me recordaba a algo: Dirty Paws https://youtu.be/mCHUw7ACS8o
Wooooo 🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡🧡💜🧡💜🧡🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡🧡💜🧡💜🧡
Fucking banger
Love the 70s rock vibes
The Chili's do faster paced music better.  Their slower stuff feels like a bumpy ride down a bad road in a very old truck.  Uncomfortable.
A Black Summer because global leaders intend to nuke all civilian populations this summer. See you all in the cosmic dust.
thanks
Will Ferrell is crazy on drums
<3
I still love the music, but I can't watch Anthony morph into a cartoon character anymore. Is it just me or is he becoming Mario ?
Jajaja ese Antony Kiddis parece actor porno de los 70's....R.H.C.P. haciendo un merecido homenaje a Diego Verdaguer, Dios lo tenga en su Gloria 😔😎👍
Gracias por siempre volver. thanks for coming ever. Soy feliz de oírlos, mí alma se infla de sentimientos. im happy of listening your music, my soul swells with feelings. Thank you for existing in my way. thanks for surviving. I hope life gives me the opportunity to see them. love
Se me paró el guebo y aguaron los ojos cuando ví a Jhon Frusciante
Listen to the band Ancient Days!!
The chorus is real nice. Chill song overall, but the song breaks out after the first chorus. Sweet dude.
See Coldplay? That’s what you should do, keep your style!
Formação perfeita . Todas foram mas com John Frusciante fica magnífico. RHCP IS MY LIFE..🤘
2:51 welcome back, Kings.
Ok john come on 😍 give us insane simply fucking shit again 🥰
Glad to see Anthony is still allergic to wearing a shirt
Ariana Grande - No tears left to cry ... ... music of course...
goosebumps
🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️
Nice to see Will Ferrel still holding it down on the drums 🥁
Was ist Islam? „Islam“ bedeutet so viel wie „Ergebung in Gottes Willen“. Ein Muslim ist also jemand, der sich Gott vollständig ergibt und Seine Ge- und  Verbote als Richtschnur für sein  Leben annimmt. Der Islam ist mehr als „nur“ eine Religion, die im alltäglichen Leben keine große Rolle spielt. Er ist vielmehr eine ideale Lebensweise für  jeden Muslim. Nach islamischem Verständnis ist der Islam keine neue Religion, sondern die gleiche Lebensweise, der alle  Propheten von Anbeginn der  Schöpfung folgten. Da die Menschen im Laufe der Zeit immer wieder vom rechten Weg abwichen, sandte Gott  verschiedene Propheten zu ihnen, um sie an die richtige Lebensweise zu erinnern. Mit jeder neuen Offenbarung wurde die zuvor gültige ersetzt. Einige dieser Propheten waren Noah, Abraham, Moses und Jesus – Friede sei mit ihnen allen. Der letzte Prophet  war Muhammad, Gott segne ihn und schenke ihm Frieden. Er gilt als das Siegel der Propheten, nach ihm wird es keine weiteren Propheten und  dementsprechend keine weiteren Offenbarungen mehr geben.
Rad.. but drop the auto tune. Faint but it’s there. I wanna here YOU Anthony. Even as you age. Not some computer
favorite Red Hot Chili song
2:50 is what I like.
warm folky verses corny rock chorus. it's simple but sweet and soulful, whatever welcome back boys!
Love this thank you, k.s.g.
❤🔥
People are not talking about the Anthony lyrics, but I loved it!! It's so emotional and powerful at the same time! Riding on a headless horse to take a trip!
They still sound powerfull ⚡
Maravillosooooos lo hicieron otra vez 🔥🔥
Suena bien 👌🏼
Mama Liz's Chili Oil!
Welcome back JF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHxk1Mg5n7I
Sad to see they used so much autotune in his voice
Made my day
Glad to be alive in 2022.
Welcome back John! We missed ya!
Todavía queda quien haga música de verdad...
Love the late 90s early 2000s vibes
золотой состав виагры не перестаёт влюблять в себя поклонников даже спустя долгие годы
зачем так хорошо 🤪
Carajo! Esto es lo que necesitaba, larga vida a los Red hot chili peppers, una gran banda que conserva sus matices aún en estos tiempos, realmente lo aprecio.
Don't. Stop.
He’s BACK!! 🤟🏾🎸
This is amazing. ..😉
Still making zero sense but sounding great 😊
Los amo gracias
Thank you guys for bringing us music like this! Rock will never die :D
Anthony is looking JACKED in this video. Good for him! And Chad is providing the Gun Show.  lol
日本から🇯🇵 彼らは最高です！
Incrível... Frusciante de volta é foda demais... emoção e coração na música..
Feels like meeting up with old friends.
Tengo 41 años,  conozco a Red Hot Chili Peppers  hace 30 años, lejos son  la banda de mi vida, me han acompañado en tantas etapas! estudios, hijos, alegrías, frustraciones…etc pero ahí están, siempre conmigo…hoy me encuentro enferma y sin dudas estos chicos son mi mayor y mejor compañía! Gracias por no abandonarme Red Hot Chili Peppers….( Frusciante,  tu guitarra y melodía,  son mi tratamiento perfecto a la vena!!!) Y la vida me dio un regalo muy bonito, mi hija que tiene 18 años, nació el mismo día de Anthony, un 1 noviembre 💚
They still got it!!!
I just love this song sooooooo much and sooooo happy they're back!!!
It’s good to see Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante again
Awesome stuff! Love this song!
gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood miusic
Damn, 5M views in 1 day
Cool!
I will always love you! They are the best, I love all their songs 🥰
Holy shit man it still sounds exactly like RHCP. I'm obsessed with music, but this is my all time favorite band. Their sound has evolved, and they seem to still have a spot for the bangers/hard sound (bc of John... but rlly its all of them lol) even in a softer, more melodic song like this one. I love that, I love them. John is the reason why I started playing guitar in the first place, this whole band is the reason I began to appreciate all genres of music. Thank you all, but especially thank you, John, for returning. Can't wait to see you four absolutely crush it here in Miami!......p.s. Play Stone Cold Bush?
Que rolototototota 🤘
🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back! Thank God! Save Music...
Cómo siempre , legendarios
Is there a reason he decided to go Irish on this one?
Didn't expect that, and it's a very pleasant surprise!
masterpiece👽
Isso eh RED HOT!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anthony looks weird but the song is great
Great to see Will Ferrel playing again.
The older Anthony gets the more he turns in to Danny Trejo.
Alta banda;  viejita ; pero muy al día del rock gracias !!!
Nice to see they still got Will Ferrell on drums...
This to me...Seems like what an extension of their 1999 album Californication would be...
Amo este grupo ❤
Welcome back RHCP 😀 so excited for the new album. Bring it on ❤️
FRUSCIANTE, FLEA, CHAD & ANTHONY,  THE DREAM LINEUP !  RCHP 4 ever!
Finalmente RHCP de volta, muita nostalgia ouvir uma boa música de novo, agora o John de volta, espero que lancem mais músicas logo
wtf is the meaning of the lyrics, it just sounds like a bunch of random shit
Gorit će ljeto
Los amo
It just beginning, cant be patient to see another masterpiece like this! , 👾
I've waited patiently for this and I'm not disappointed, this will be the album of the year for me.
The good, old and original RHCP is back.
It is not a good song...  Just nostalgic. But if this is the best they got after so many years. Well, it is what is
Jesus christ, Red Hot Chili Peppers is back? Beautiful Jam.
Very good. Nice song.
Same old shit. John Frusciante is a god as always though, of course.
I will forever love this band
Amazing 😱
The first time I saw other side video I was frying hard on LSD..woohoo
Why does he sound Irish
His vocal delivery 🤔
Tienen que revivir el rock ahora es cuando más se los necesita
Black summer!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice song
5million views in a Day... Welcome back John.   This is fresh!
Una alegría enorme a mi corazón. Mi mente vuelve a surfear en las melodías de los peppers.
New Muse, and now new RHCP, 2022 looking good for the rock scene for sure...
show
Never forget John Frusciante and Flea spiked River Phoenix's drink and he died while they played on stage. Satanic ritual for success of their blood sex sugar magic album.
My dad was a big RHCP fan. He left this world back in 1994. I can't help but feel sad that he'll never hear their music that came after, but I know that he would still be listening to the enduring sounds of Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Chad Smith, and John Frusciante.  RIP Dad. And long live Red Hot Chili Peppers!
que bacan que sigan siendo los mismos ! super stadium arcadium energia !
Wow! with John Frusciante On stage.. amazing video, we love you...
Nice song!,,,
is it just me or do anthony's dance moves remind anyone else of Mac from IASIP doing karate?
Sabe o que é você ficar quase 10 horas ouvindo uma música!! Sim 10 fucking horas, MDS tô em êxtase em ouvir a guitarra do John Frusciante de novo 😍😍😍. O Josh conseguiu segurar as pontas, mas o Frusciante é sem comparação ❤️❤️
Will Ferrell is rocking out on the drums.
I can't believe that I found this video by tendency because it has  many reggaeton
perfect .
this song makes you feel free
RHCP is back!
As someone who really doesn't listen to music, but will tell you RHCP is their favorite band. It was a delightful surprise when I seen a new music video was out. :)
Needs more cowbell.
This new guitarist has a lot of potential. He's ready to be awesome like Josh. Welcome to the RHCP fam.
Como siempre John Frusciante viene a dar la magia a la banda arriba Red Hot Chili Peppers
I can't wait to hear more of the album.
Que genial ver a John Frusciante de nuevo en casa
El solo de frusciante es tan calido y el video se ve tan natural que es como que si nunca se hubiesen separado,  espero los red hot vivan muchos años mas para poder verlos en vivo algun dia
Will Ferrell's still got it! :D
Put a little bit of flute in this song and it would be an awesome Jethro Tull song!
Por favor vengan a Bogotá todo bien se quedan en mi rancho por posada relajaos 🥺🥺🥺
Frusciante gracias por existir ♥️
Nice to see Will Ferrell doing something other than movies.
Long overdue
Welcome back John. We missed you.
Wow 5 million already. About 100 was me. Loving the new music
never fail
I feel like I'm in the 7th grade again 😭😭😭
they all look cracked out of there heads 🤣🤣🤣
After all this waiting I'm happy to say that I LOVE this song 🤍
This song feels very reminiscent to their album Stadium Arcadium and I’m not complaining.
Some people don't like it, so they shit on people who like it. Strange hobby
Yes!!!
Frusciante is back to home! Your place is in the Peppers!
John frusciante always brings the fucking heat
February the 5th 2022
❤
He's bricked up
Meu coração ❤
Okay well I love it, but just one thing: Anthony's voice sounds different. First of all, I think it's auto-tuned too much, which may or may not have been the intention for the song's style. Anthony also pronounces the R's at the end of certain words differently, which makes him sound like he has some sort of accent, which is just a little off-putting since I expect to hear his voice the way it sounds in all of the Pepper's other songs.
os melhores. Sem mais.
N tem como no viajar nesse som nessa  banda q esta aqui n meu ❤
Bots.......you can buy them
lovely
Esta muy buena la canción RHCP toda la vida
meguta
Me encanta :DDDDDD
UAU!!!!!  Back to the 80's
This song is just beautiful the bass is amazing chilli pepper are back
god they dont get old
Its a dream to see John again
I was hesitant at first, but this song rocks. I am a John fan boy through and through!
These guys never drop anything bad cant wait for this Album
Por red hot le hecho ganas a la vida ♥️
The real Chili Peppers are finally back
*RHCP FOREVER*
Rhcp para sempre!
I think RHCP have reached a very high level of songwriting since several albums ago you can recognize a clear authentic and unique style.
This is so good they didn’t have to go that hard
RHCP=High Quallity.🎸🎸🎹🎤📻
awesome vibe
🔥
Buen regreso !!
This song feels like it's part or the Mars album. I love it.
Instant Classic Song 2022
I'm here for the party boys
Welcome back John! Welcome back the Red Hot Chili Peppers! 🔥🕊️🎶
😌
The 90’s was the last decade that produced bands with sounds that were exclusively their own.  You hear RCHP, you know it’s them right away.
This is just OK.
Red Hot não perde sua essência nunca! E como é diferenciado o instrumental da banda com o John. Bem vindo de volta grande Frusciante!
Covid Pandemification.
He reminds me of Eddie Guerro
Que de mais só as lenda
Still can't figure out the Irish accent thing but beyond that this is a really good song.
Muybueno.Hace tiempo que no los escuchaba, me alegro el finde.
getting old, getting perfect !!
its just me or the lyrics notes sounds like "sea shanties"?
Rolou não, aguardar as próximas...
Honestly if the rest of this album sounds like this, we're gonna be looking at a certified banger soon enough
The fact that John Frusciante is back in the band is the best part of all
Why is he singing like he doesnt speak english? Like everything is pronounced so weird. Not gonna lie it sounds bad.
I discovered this on my come down from  trip from shrooms and it was fucking amazing
Oq mais precisávamos era dessa essência nos dias de hoje, os cara nunca perdem a mão
Одна из моих любимых групп, но этот клип снятый на зелёном фоне/ свет панелях смотрится просто отстойно. Даже саму песню слушать не хочется.   Мне одному так показалось?
Eeeeeeeek *having a fan girl moment!!!***
What is this supposed to be after 17 years?
Massa demais! Amo RHCP! 👏👏👏♥️
Great to see family back together doing what they do best.... been too long!
❤❤❤❤❤
#1 on trending btw
Passando BR por aqui. Fazendo fila, galera! Rs
Is this an #SNL VIDEO? Pathetic 🤭
They are back!!!!👏👏👏
so glad frusciante's back
This is beautifull!
Great Song! 🎸🇮🇹
mad stadium arcadium vibes
1:52 ✨✨✨✨🙌✨✨✨✨✨
This song is the freight train we've all been waiting to hit us!
Wow... que demais. Bom demais ouvir essa guitarrinha novamente. Fodaaaa!!!
Thank You RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ✨this is Life.... This is  J. FRUSCIANTE in Chili Peppers  ✨
For Christ sakes can Chad Smith play anything else on the drums. This song is generic. Retire
https://youtu.be/xj7etrgoFWo who from the 90s?
anthony's voice sounds the same and he's 59
I'm 40 now. Listen to red hot Chilli pepper bring so much happy memories. Simple life, simple mind, simple world.
Always impressed by how they can keep their essence. I hope a great album to come!!!
🍻🍻🍻
Welcome back RHCP!! Welcome Tony, Flea, Chad, and Johnny!! Welcome, welcome, welcome!! 🙏🏾😊
Espetacular🎸🎼💯
Welcome back John <3
Ummm🤨... They've lost it 😒
Una de las mejores bandas
años y años tocando y la siguen rompiendo. Zarpado.
:) *
Welcome again....🙂 (Ecuador)
I respect John... but no is no better red hot 😔
This is…not…good
https://youtu.be/JzDifRoUBJg
So is this the one where Anthony stops pretending he is going to even put a shirt on at all?
De sempre ! 😍😍😍 Brazil 🤘
Ahhh, The Spinoff To Znation Finally has a cover.
this is amazing
🤘🤘🤘🤘
Just jam man
What a great drummer Will Ferrell is
London in the Black Summer time
He's ripped for his age,good for u anthony
Just One word "AMAZING" !!!!!
Flea does this nihilist runnig style again
🇧🇷05/02/2022
Hearing that John harmony, OH MY GOD DID I MISS IT!!! :,)
Muy poca música en la actualidad tiene una escencia única y tan honesta. RHCP, muchas gracias por traer de nuevo este sentimiento en una época muy plástica y volátil.
Meh.
Te amamos John 💕
0:47 pude escuchar el grito de los fruscianistas bien agudo
Why does Anthony sound like he’s auditioning for the Cranberries?
Minha banda preferida simplesmente amo
Lo he esperado desde hace tiempo. Los red hot son parte de nuestras vidas.
What the fuck happened 🤣😅
Top !!! Red Hot transcendendo gerações!! Top demais........
Pure essence! John is back , RHCP is RHCP again.
Lejen..
I was listening Linkin Park and this song came out and I thought was an old song in the beginning :D
0:48 dont know keanu reeves play guitar for red hot chilli peppers
Если бы это спели какие-то неизвестные ребята, то никто бы эту песню и не заметил.
Desintoxican el area con verdadera música !
AAAAAAA RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS FULL CON FRUSCIANTE!! SONIDO IMPECABLE, JOSH HIZO LO  SUYO NADA QUE DECIR, PERO AHORA SON COMPLETOS DENUEVO, AGUANTE LOS PEPPERS!!
Anthony's gone Lloyd Christmas in the front and Harry Dunn in the back
RHCP has risen to be the greatest band in the world!  So fortunate to still have them feeding this energy into the universe.
I love John
Will Ferrell on the drums ladies and gentlemen!
Genial, muy buena
I’ve been waiting for a long time… long live RHCP
Don Flea, Don Chad, Don John, Don Anthony.
This is the shit
23 no em alta do Brasil 🇧🇷 Vocês são umas lendas!!!
💪🏻👑👊🏻
O U T S T A N D I N G ! Red Hot Chili Peppers         F O R E V E R !
Finally, some good music in ut trends for a couple of years!
Welcome back Mr.Frusciante, the world missed you as hell. 🔥🔥🔥
He's back home 😭
Que musica gostosaaaaaaa
Give it Hot Peppers 👍
Замечательно! Чад не попадает в фанеру. Дожили! Это перцы постарели или долбанные режиссеры/монтажеры теперь такого уровня?
Love the song, but I have to ask about Anthony’s accent. Has he been living in Iceland or something?😂
(2:36) até aqui Gabigol?
Lyrics:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
I don't get it
Finally back with great song john frusciante mantaabbbhhh
Foda demais e ponto.
Great song love it u r rock
damn and i thought we were finally taking mlk jr's rhetoric about the misuse of "black" in poetry to heart
Reminds me a bit of Pali Gap by Jimi Hendrix
Weeehoooo 🔥
i knew anthony and fleas tops wouldn’t stay on the whole video

John is back!!!!!
one word: GOLD
John is back?
Loving this 🔥🌶️ looking forward to hearing the new album xx
This song reminds me of the good that can come outta California. It’s the chilies being in their element. They’ve defined the California sound in a way. Good to hear it again with frusciante back in the band. He hasn’t lost that sound.
Will Ferrell...😂😂😂😂
Que top essa musica ⚫
🌶
O homi tá de volta caralho! 💙💙💙🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Que sonzeira meus amigos.
Frusiante is back no wonder this song is good
Thanks jhon for coming back and inspire US again.
This is Red hot!!! Yeahhhh
La vida me abraza con esta banda tan maravillosa.
Сильно ! Прям как раньше!
Já estou viciado nessa música, mal posso esperar o disco completo!!! 🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
My Legends
I like soo much this music.  peace and freedom!!!
Not feeling this song at all. He's got a weird singing accent like Irish and it's not working for me
Se viene nuevo álbum ❤
yes
I never watched a RHCP music video, and i think this will be my last. I thought the lead singer looked like Joe Exotic and was severely confused.  love their music though.
Good to see will farel back on the drums
I'll be waiting yours long time, and now finally come back 🔥🔥
Frusciante will leave again
Escutando pela 18382819192o vez amo vcs
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back! Hell Yeah!
JOHN IS BACK 🌠🛸
I wish to be in a so good form at 59 as Anthony. The Man
Abemos solos de guitarra!!! Lobo velho perde o pelo mais não os dentes !
They used to be funky. Now they're just... old.
Amoooooo
Aê. Tá do caralho. O retorno do Frusciante, porra.
❤
Not a single one 'California' mentioned... hahah
On gang!!!!!!!
Red hot grandpa chilli pepper🤣😂

2022 si saved now !! Thanks rhcp !!
Red Hot eternamente...
Same guys, waiting for the black summer to end too. Thank you for a great track that is quintessentially the Chili Peppers sound that I love.
Anthony Kiedis is a daddy !
These 4 have unmatched chemistry while playing. So happy to hear some new music from you guys.
Wooooow!!! 🦾👽🦾
What a cool song…
The Black Summer Times, as Understanding OverNeath former Tarpits...   🔥🕉⚛️☸️🔥
Love love love it!!!
Just like a fine wine!!
2:52 - I can watch this moment forever and I don't even need a sound (of course it's better with). I don't know how it works, but there is a chemistry between this guys, especially when they are together, it's like giants walk the earth.
Looking forward to see them playing live again
So glad to see they’re back, smiling ear to ear right now
Can't wait to see you live soon!
Sounds like washed up recycled BS trying to pass as fresh...LOL😂
🤘🏻🔥
What's with his accent?
Is this real?!
Fascinante que as músicas do Red Hot são inconfundíveis!
❤️💜❤️🙏🏻
John Anthony MOTHERFUCKING FRUSCIANTE IS BACK
Jhon mother fucking frusciante and the red hot chili peppers
Que buena canción!!! se escucha esa vibra melancólica pero potente y que emerge en algo así como el despertar! una bestia la canción! Los Red Hot en todos sus álbumes y canciones se encuentra presente eso que les vuelve únicos.
Cuanto tiempo mis oídos esperaban oír  algo nuevo de esta legendaria banda. Aguante rhcp
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
First line of melody and I hear Island Boyeeeessss
whens the album out?
Keep it coming guys, you're f*cking awesome
back in business
🔥🤘🔥
oficialmente la mejor cancion de el año
Retornando al puro estilo deL álbum Stadium Arcadium, Frusciante 🔥 y el espectacular bass line de Flea, los amo
is that a jojo reference
I've always loved this group and I must admit that it's been a long time since we've seen or heard them. They sign their return with a good song worthy of their universe. Long live the album !
EPICCCC, one of my favorite bands :D
Ficou da hora, solo top
🤘🏻
Que saudade desse solo! Seja bem vindo de volta John!
John's solo @1:52 gives me strong "Strip My Mind" solo vibes. Love it!
<3
Will Ferrell just gets better and better. Great drummer.
Der Buchhandel Berlin germany
the great song! RHCP signature!
Aaaaah essa sonoridade que me lembra 1999!  Frusciante is in da house again! ❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷
I've waited 16 years for these guys to come back together for another album, the feeling seeing all 4 together is indescribable.
John Frusciante 😍
nunca tive depressão!!!!!!😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Z Maguinho da Califórnia
Stadium arcadium vibes
Q seas eterno..!!
Ya quiero escuchar el disco completo .
all our love to john, omg this is so good.
Fru, Fru, Fru FRU IS BACK BABY. Now that's a RHCP that I missed
La mejor Banda sus canciones son 💕💕💕💕
Chad's drums such a signature
Genial!
Chills. My childhood buddies are back....much love to everyone out there.
🔆
THEY  ARE AND THEY WILL BE A LEGEND!!!!!!!!
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☮️☮️☮️☮️✌🏽
This sounds like if someone made a computer listen to the entire RHCP discography, and then had it write it's own song
I just wanna know why he’s singing with like a weird sea shanty accent
Great to see them making music together gain but the track is a little… well, underwhelming if I’m being honest. When you consider the first singles they’ve released as a group over the last few albums - Scar Tissue, By The Way and Dani California - it’s not as catchy. Hopefully it’ll be a grower.
Welcome back John
that colored vinyl went quick :(
Нехера себе!!!!))) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🤟🤟🤟👍💪
Are we not gonna talk about how they are l still in good shape
90s vibes!!!
John Frusciante became so lazy...
…. Music, will heal us all… and unite us once and for all… 🙏🏾
Now we're talking.
🤘🏼🎸🎧🎶
🍾🎶🍺🎶🔥
Aaaaah they are back! This song is beautiful, It's like an ode to themselves and has elements of all the classics, everything we all love about the chillis. That riff and "I'VE BEEN WAAAITIN, IVE BEEN WAIIITIN!" brilliant!- I've been waitin for this song guys, thank you x
Always 🌶🌶🌕
Meu John tá lindo demais, af
Well that was enjoyable. Brought a smile to my face to hear john back playing again.
É uma pena que eles morrerão um dia, mais uma coisa é certa eles deixarão eternamente essa verdade em nossos ouvidos e corações! Frusciante, Chad, Flea e Kids....Tank you! Por trazer um sentimento único mais uma vez, precisavamos disso e vocês encontraram um som leve, dançante e reflexivo com uma pitada de nostalgia e realidade.
Tienen esa melodía única, inmortal!
Keanu Reeves -lead guitar / Will Farrell- drums  / Daniel day Lewis - lead vocals / and... Flea
Nico one
I have watched this video countless times since yesterday. It gives me chills every single time 🌶😍 Love it!!!!!
Looking good!
The drumming of RHCP is massively underrated...
Great song, but what is up with Anthony Kiedis' hair?
These dudes were old in the 90s. Surprised they're all still alive.
Learning Facts Helps End Atrocities Torsten Trey, Executive Director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), said in the opening remarks that “this horrific practice is beyond our imagination and thinking as human beings.”  “It is impossible to speak about the Holocaust without mentioning the Jewish people, and in the same sense, it is also impossible to speak about forced organ harvesting in China without mentioning the Falun Gong,” he explained.  Trey warned the medical community that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been pursuing an eradication campaign against Falun Gong since July 1999. By delegating the execution of innocent Falun Gong practitioners from the courts to the hospitals, the CCP has thereby weaponized the transplant profession in China and turned it into the executioner under the name of transplantation. “However, killing a living person for the purpose of providing a cure for another person, turns medicine into an absurd practice and violates the medical oath,” he continued.  “I hold that by objectively speaking about the practice of Falun Gong in public, the incentives for the Chinese government to use forced organ harvesting as a means to eradicate the practice and deprive the international community from learning about Falun Gong will be defeated, and the stealth weaponization of the medical profession will be disarmed,” Trey added, “The earlier the world learns about Falun Gong, the earlier the forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners will end.”  In fact, Falun Gong is based on the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. He said,“Talking about the victim’s practice serves two purposes. It not only gives a voice to the voiceless, but it also provides the most powerful and most peaceful approach to combat forced organ harvesting.”
Дякую, що ви знову разом! І за те , що знову творите! 😃 це свято!
John frusciente
Now if Steve Irwin comes back to life... my childhood can return to stasis 😒
Eles voltaram ❤❤❤
Love u guys. Hugs from Brazil 🇧🇷
Джон Фрушанте гений.как же не хватало его риффов и видения звука.до мурашек
I was a bit worried at first and thought he wouldn't go full shirtless, but he saved it! I am disappointed that he never said "California" though.
Let's not encourage a group of sexual predators music. Don't get too hung up on anyone caring about your music, just enjoy the recording process
<3
FINALMENTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Rockin the diddler stache
This gives me Especially in Michigan vibes!
They're back! 😁🤘🏽
Uff, épico. Ver una de las bandas más icónicas de mi juventud tan actual y con su esencia limpia y sin pretenciones es magistral, ahora le sumas a John Frusciante, como siempre debió ser y entran a otro nivel. Simplemente perfecto
Just. The Best. Amen
C00nification
Muy buen tema, con la llegada de Frusciante suena mejor 🎸 Larga vida a los Peppers 🤘🏻
They're back.
Sounds like my low rise jeans years☺️ Proud fan since 20 years😉
Fuck yeah 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭        PS: Fuck Trappers 🖕
John's return has stopped me hating Anthony's moustache
Urgh. This song is weak af. So sad to see 😞 no stand out moments for any of the instruments or vocals. Nothing memorable here at all
Grew up w/ this band, feels good seeing them still at it.
Que lindo verlo saltar como un desquiciado entre John Fru, Flea y Chad.  Una vez más!  🤜♥️🤛 🇦🇷
SI
Terrible
Anthony is 60 this year... looking like that
Buena música al fin !!!
0:49 John Frusciante OMG 🤩🤩🤩🤟👍👊
ermao estuve esperando esto tanto tiempo,es hermoso
Amazing. Sounds silly, but, I'm 30 years old, this instantly made me feel 15 again. Sneaking around quiet corridors blasting live in Hyde Park on my CD Player repetitively. Avoiding teachers and class. Feeling distinctly invisible, but absolutely adoring the solitude for the chance to get lost in their music. What a killer song. These four just have a certain magic. They 100% still have that magic. Beautiful. ✌️
The solo is stupidly good, and the song not to mention, Everything is perfect with Red Hot chili peppers!!Magnificent
Really sharp one. Plain materials refines to this powerful outcome... pure RHCP
Seguidor de Los RHCP mas de 15 años! Saludos desde Mendoza ARG
Love it
Loving it but Anthony you gotta get rid of the mullet and 80s porn stache. Been waiting for this quad to reunite.
Finally Kiedis Without T shirt: 0:00 *Hell* *yeah*   --- 3 Doritos later --- *Holly* *shit* 1:26
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🇧🇷
I'll stick with the old stuff. I'll have to pass on this one
que banda maravilhosa ❤️🇧🇷
Ufff una delicia de rola! Frusciante se nota 😍 simplemente me encanto 🤟🏻
Always good to see Will Ferrel banging drum.
I like how chilli's have always kept their sound and style throughout the years. As soon as Chad kicked in, it instantly takes to me back to my long car journeys playing By the way and  Californication.
Amerita tomame un par de cervezas escuchando severo tema yeahhhhhh
They back baby
Siempre es un placer escuchar a estos californianos.......
Oh yes, it is good to have these guys back
anthony’s vocals are a little wack but good track boys keep up you might get big one day
man i missed them, the power of frusciante and flea is awesome. Anthony looks like a 30 year old dude although he is nearly 60. And Chad still looks like Will Ferrell. AMAZING
Ufff la partieron
Independente do John Frusciante estar na banda ou não, Red Hot sempre faz músicas gêniais, todos os guitarristas que passaram pela banda fizeram sua contribuição. Todos os músicos tem seu valor nessa banda!!
https://youtu.be/Ta3wdzBvfus
That guitar tone at 1:51 tho........
Demais!!
This band is going to a long Hall Of Fame
RHCP never stops, I look forward to the new album.  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
0:44 - 0:56
When did Anthony turn into the pedo with a windowless van guy?
These song and video are the real soul of the band.
🖤
The legends
Me encantó la rola, larga vida al rock,!!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Literal es la única banda que siempre se juega con nuevos sonidos, estilos y experimentar con varios géneros haciéndolos sonar como si lo hubieran tocado por años.
They sound like the Red Hot Chili Peppers again. This makes me happy.
q locura
I always confused the drummer with WIll ferrell
Cuando para Sud América peppers?!?! 😭😭
Aguante Chilli Peppers !!! Bienvenido John !!!
What happened to the funk? 😔
Esto es hermoso, amigos!
meh nothing new.... same old meh
Welcome back Frusciante.
Whoa it sounds undoubtedly RHCP
Foda pra krlh 🤘🏻🖤🖤🖤
I was waiting for this so long... I didn´t know I was waiting, but I surely was. Awesome song
🖤🖤🖤🎸🎸🎸🖤🖤🖤🎶🎶🎶🖤🖤🖤 Loveu.
un brano intimista lontano dagli eccessi del passato. nostalgico e malinconico come spesso sono i rhcp.
Why is he singing with an Irish accent?
Rodacy, jesteście tutaj!? Świetna piosenka 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻😛😉😁
Will ferrel still kicking ass on drums
El mejor easter-egg es la base de batería con la que empieza
Gracias por existir 🙌🏽
*Kd os br admirando essa obra de arte ??🇧🇷🇧🇷🤟🤟*
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)   Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun   It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailin' on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip   Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end   I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
What going on here Rick Beautoe?
Favourite band is back! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Como siempre los mejores del mundo.Los amo!!!!
Oh John how we missed you. I hope you know how loved you are.
Jesus is back!!!
Will Ferrell is an amazing drummer
Anthony lookin like Danny Trejo...
Why does he look like an 70s porn star now
Also, Rick Rubin is back!
Feliz demais em vê-los juntos novamente 😍
Great to see keanu reeves has picked up the guitar again
vivendo desde 2016 esperando esse álbum. Nem consigo acreditar
SOOOOO GOOOD THOUGH! 🙌🏻
Seeing John makes me cry happy tears
Lo escuché mil veces en menos de 24 horas, maravilloso, MARAVILLOSO!
Every time when i hear Red Hot Chili Peppers. It give me chickenskin❤💯
Who knows hot chili pepper from jojo
Whats the RHCP song they did about California?
Não gostei.
Frusciante!
LEGENDS
This just made my day!!
frusciante thanks, red hot since californication until today. thanks #respect
Mr mustache
This song being released and being as good as it is makes me so emotional. I cannot help but smile from start to finish. I've been a diehard fan for over 20 years and I am so proud to call this my music. This song is beautiful and everything  I hoped it would be. Everyone saying that it isn't the real chili's needs to get a grip. Music evolves. These guys have been producing for almost 40 years. Do you really think they're going to do the same thing over and over again? Even now they're still growing and still getting better and thats incredible. After a tough year this song has made me so happy.
♥️
To hear and see them again is just like to be with my loved ones after years, feeling I am HOME❤❤❤this song is perfect
Graças a Deus lançaram uma música nova, estava com tanta saudade das músicas deles
John's back.  Nuf said.  🙂
💩💩💩
The Fantastic Four are baaaaack, can't wait to listen to the album.
Veeeery very good! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
who is still listening to this song in 2022?
He dabbed at 2:11
Aaaaah que lindo meus favoritos juntos novamente ! ❤️
I've been waiting...great song, lyrics, and video!
Viva John Frusciante, Josh Klinghoffer es un pendejo
John is back 💪
Esta es la mejor droga del mundo
porque? porque... estoy llorando?
Słabe, niestety
Awesome made me fall in love with the band again
Welcome back! 🙂🤟🏻
It must be the end of the world... RHCP is back. 💯❤👽

I’m only 17, and I found rhcp about a year ago. I’m hooked. I love so much of their music, and I am so hype for this album!
🥲 i love you
Vocês querem rock? Então toma! Simplesmente fodasticos!!
Nunca decepciona! Sempre esse mesma vibe porém o som novo.
Hot damn! We've all missed John!
❤️🌶
Porra que nostalgia! Red Hot é atemporal vey, vida longa aos caras. Bom rever o guitarrista que tinha saído, acho que o batera TB... enfim a formação antiga vivaaa!  Ps: eu estava indignada com Antônio criança vestido....ainda bem q ele não me decepcionou! Kkkkkkk
always the best
Who would have thought seeing that usual John Shirt would bring so many emotions and memories back? 🥺
John is back??? The second I saw him I thought my head will explode! Goodness, such a gift!
❤️🔥🌶
Everyone is entitled to their opinions but facts don't lie, these 4 dudes are timeless. Viva RHCP❤❤❤
For the algorithm
❤️❤️🤟🏼
estan muy viejos ya, retirense, me dormi a la mitad de la cancion
Supero minha  Espequitativas
Grandi come sempre💪💪
Not words just rhcp
Thanks guys you gave me goose bumps.Another hit
Sup with the weird Amish accent Anthony?? Lol!
Having been a fan for 34 yrs this seemed kind of bland. I know I  might catch flack for this but to each their own. Glad to see they are still doing what they love.
c maman con su música estos cracks
Hey 1999, 2022 is calling.
John Frusciante really brings out the best in the rest of the band.
How is Anthony Kiedis nearly 60 years old????
The’re the best :’)
Thank you so much for this incredible gift guys ❤️ What a lovely and funny track you made. Unlimited love is what I feel for you! Keep having fun and connecting your souls, is such an incredible gift for the universe what you make.
I still feel like I’m living in twilight zone .. I remember praying if I had one music wish it would be for John to return . And I can’t believe it actually happened . Not to mention how happy the 4 of them seem . ANTHONY JOHN FLEA CHAD 🔥 🌶 forever
Will Farrell is excellent on the drums! I had no clue
i feel like i've heard the melody of the chores somewhere befor :I

So cool to see John Frusciante perform again with RHCPs!

Som maravilhoso, RHCP sempre fazendo arte
I'm so happy they are back ❤️
I'm so in love with John's solo 🥺❤️🥰🇧🇷
Holy shit, this is gorgeous. John still got it, as if he was never gone.
Durk side of the moon :)
16 years to hear the magic Frusciante brings to this band, and finally, us avid RHCP fans get to see it and hear it again! Love you guys, keep doing what you do! Stadium Arcadium was amazing, and I’m sure Unlimited Love will be just as if not more!
Stadium Arcadium vibes for sureeeeeee
This just made my day!
God Damn John! It's good to have you back. Your guitar solos always leave me mesmerized!
yasss you’re back 💥

That guitar solo is insane
the autotune isn't working for me.  The band sounds amazing otherwise!
Perfeitos como sempre... 💕👏
Thanks. I was wondering if rock and roll had died and hadn't told anyone.
Ainda não caiu a ficha que Frusciante voltou! Eu vivi pra ver isso! Amo RHCP! ❤
Los amo juntos. 🖤
👌❤  just great
I've been waitin', I've been waitin', waitin' on a chili pepper single to come!

John Frusciante... there are no words to describe what he transmits with that guitar, I can only cry with emotion and happiness.
fuck yeah!
interesting, i thought his voice changed in the first half of the song and then he changed his singing style back to how I thought his voice sounds lol
Unlimited love
Magic 4❤️
https://youtu.be/WgOVScoNB5w
I really like what they did here. It's great to see them together making music again.
Always wished to see this four men again. I guess wishes do come true.
Can't believe how good Neo plays the guitar 🤘🏽
I love you so much
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Six years waiting for a new album FINALLY 🌶
That guitar solo is absolutely stunning , so simple but catchy. Can’t get enough of this song 🎧
I saw it was the Californication bros and I immediately clicked on it. These guys are legends!!!! I'll smack the shittouuttayou if you say otherwise...
Its like wishing for something you know will never happen but then it actually does, the chemistry is just so beautiful💥, you can literally feel it. This son invokes such a warm feeling, it really captures wat the chilli peppers are all about, its more than just music, it tells a story of how far we have come, a true sign tat true passion and love never really dies. it is a symbol of red hot hope for the chilli pepper family world wide, cant wait for the new album🎸✴

Tqm RHCP<3
JOHN TE AMO❤🔥
HE'S BACK! THEY'RE BACK!!!
Back to back!💪
RHCP has been part of my life since I was a child when I listened to it as a baby, every time I listen to one of their songs it brings me peace, and this one now made me feel the same way I feel when I listen to Dark Necessities, songs that make me forget from the problems and just enjoy this wonderful sound that this band has always brought, thank you for existing !!!!  <3
Мёд для моих ушей
He is David Carradide it is Kung Fu.
JF 🙏🏻
el que toca es will ferrel verdad ¡?¡¡ guiño guiño
This is awesome
Californication is road to 1B v1ews!  support Chili Peppers on Spotify too!
Anyone getting stone sour- bother vibes?
Heard they were doing covers of songs in preparing for this albums recording...would love to see a covers release in conjunction someday
temazo
thank you for the constant happiness you give us guys. you'll always stay young and music is helping us through everything. heartbreaking track
Weak Sauce
I just wanted to say thank you to Deborah Chow, the crew and everyone involved to make a kick ass music video. The music video gives me good vibes and much joy,  that I feel along with the song and music as a whole. Good job and I appreciate everyone's work. Be safe and stay well for 2022. 😘😀
one thing is right and keeps staying right in life... at least...
Anthony is almost 60 years old and looks ripped
Amazing !! ❤️🖤
Finally, Will Ferrell at the drums again
Damn Black Summer is killing it with vocals and riffs
melhor surpresa que tive
Ok I will be that guy....This is absolute garbage, they have not put out anything worth while since they all got clean.  this thing is full of left leaning propaganda and and it just a bad song.  AK looks like a 90's Russian porn star.
Will Ferrell are kind of good at drums
They are back together! Yes! :)
They lost me when they fired Josh, but I assume they will get over it.
Josh did a stellar job, and I wish him the best. That being said, Frusciante just hits different. My god his feel is just something else.
I enjoyed it.
Bro how is Anthony 59 and that jacked
A guitarra do John transmite uma vibe indescritível
oh my god oh my god oh my god
Best things in 2022 spider-man no way home and RHCP new album with John Frusciante!!
They look old But they sound young
I love you John Fru! ❤️
Damn I'm so glad Fruiscante is back and they are making new music. AND IT'S SO GOOD TOO!!
Finally,, from Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 🙌 🙏
Why does he sound Irish?
Did he eurostep at 0:06
LOS AMO CARAJO
Cuando regresa john, es porque habra cosas impresionantes!
+5k for 5M !
damn... i feel so slow. so high. like a summer duet.  oulalaaa Monsieur Le Kiedis !
UNLIMITED LOVE FULL ALBUM (APRIL 1) 🔥

You are not of this world!!!
Önce gitarı görünce, adamın gitarını çalmışlar dedim.
LEGENDARY!
😍👍💖💖
Niech ten moment powrotu trwa wiecznie! ♥️
Instant Cassic ♨️🔥🔥🔥♨️♨️🔥🔥
😕Only thing I don't like is the China is on dark side of the moon. Why, why????
I love it! ❤️
I miss the slap tho, welcome back John!
Super Band and Song
❤ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜 🖤
Q bien,me sonó a by the way
Thanks for coming back. I loved 😁🤘🏽
Back like he never left
It's ok but the fact this is the main single is worrying.
FRUSCIANTEEE ❤‍🔥
Shirtless Anthony is classic..! He's aging really well.. 💚
Welcome again to the greats #RHCP= GOATs
Great to see Will Ferrell playing drums
Voltaram as origens!!
Same emo teen crap since Californication. Call Mr. Navarro for some edge.
Los red hot están de vuelta ,grandes  ídolos
100th time listening to this who else
frusciante nunca se fue, verlos a los 4 juntos, es como si solo estuvieron en pausa. Sin embargo la formula Red hot siempre se mantiene fresca, con Frusciante o sin.  verlos a los cuantro, son ellos, es como la figurita mas preciada en un album de figuritas
Still terrible.
Hi was thinking about this band the other day  :)
So good to hear Frusciante back in the mix....Proper RCHP sound again
And yet another hit from an awesome band!
I love this song
From 2:53 the mic stand decided to have a field day trip doing yoga
RHCP FOR LIFE
THE STRAT IS BACK
Horrible song
John Frusciante!! ROBI ROBOTĘ!!
This is Rockkkkk !!! In 2022 amazing
*Chorus sounding like Slow Cheetah ?*
Fruciante, maravilloso y los RHCP por Dios suenan como en los 90.
Love ❤️😘
RHCP at its best!
Insanely excited for this. Double album too!
John hasn't aged a day. What the fuck?
Сколько изменилось за это,а они те же рокеры и тот же стиль,браво!!!настоящих исполнителей,ничто не поменяет и не изменит,респект
Ooh my, like the old good days coming back
Where's the Love button??? I demand a love button!!!
Long live to RHCP! Wellcome again John!
the intro reminds me of the original karate kid theme background music...
why there's no "california" in the lyrics?
they are not the red hot chili peppers ! the red hot chili peppers knew how to play guitar & bass & drums ..
rock!
They got Will Farrel on the drums?
Sounds great! Like classic Chilis again, love it.
Anthony Kiedis is the new Iggy Pop.
OMG. YES. HELL YES. LOVE LOVE LOVE RHCP.
This song is kind of  mediocre to me.....life long fan of RHCP....I do love the band and music . Still really excited about the return of Frusciante.  Not saying it's a bad song or anything . However, if I never heard of them before and this was my introduction, I'd leave underwhelmed.
My boo Will Ferrell on the drums.
С возвращением!)))
Дождался
los amoooooooooo
Obrigado! 🙏🏻
Ele é lindo mas esse bigode é horrível.
The Californication drumming hits strong
Boring
Наконец они все вместе❤ Фрушанте с возвращением!😍
Meraviglia 💖 May I ask for the lyrics? Greetings from Italy!
Once a RHCP fan , ALWAYS will be a RHCP fan !!
This could have been a great acoustic song! Why didn't they see this too!?

Sound of a lifetime.
A Great beginning for this new year ❤

Шикарно.
Con Frusciante sono i veri Red Hot....grandi💪
Their grandkids are awfully lucky
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Come to Brazil RHCP! Make my inner child dreams come true!  Frusciante, we love you!
This small part of my life is called happiness
.
É ótimo ver o Frusciante novamente com a banda! A atmosfera é completamente diferente com ele! Essa música me passa uma certa melancolia e traz diversas interpretações para fatos do nosso cotidiano, como as mudanças climáticas, o impacto que a pandemia teve em nossas relações sociais, a competição pela exploração espacial que remete aos tempos da Guerra Fria e coisas da vida pessoal do Anthony Kiedis.
Que venham mais músicas 🌶️🔥❤️
Kiedis obviously is a huge fan of 'the Tiger King' ...
It's impressive how they're still putting out content in their 70s
This song was actually good !
joe exotic?
The guitar sound at first 9 sec 👌🏼
https://youtu.be/0JugFtBavao
Ese sonido es su esencia, su adn. Los amo ! 💜 verlos juntos de nuevo, me llena de felicidad . Los mejores siempre !
Wack, sucks how they just trashed Josh like nothing.
Musiquinha chata de ouvir 😒
John’s solos never fail to give me goosebumps! He’s been missed
What the hell is this song even about?   Funny how overview of freeways in LA make some people feel bad while making others feel like it's the lifeblood of the city.  Overall the song feeds negative emotions so I would rather not listen to it again or much of anything that they put out.
Caramba a fixa ainda não caiu John de volta as RHCP depois de tantas idas e vindas ele está de volta , sempre sonhei com esse dia e graças a Deus eles estão de volta John Frusciante você é top cara
That Haircut! 😁👌 great song.
Как же я долго ждал этого.🤩 Наконец-то вы вместе: Энтони, Фли, Чед и конечно же Джон Фрушанте - ЗОЛОТОЙ СОСТАВ группы. Ребята, вы лучшие!👍 Жду с нетерпением новый долгожданный альбом с участием Джона Фрушанте.😊
I love how you know its chad on the drums
480p production in 2022 ?
Ohhhhh yerrrrrr
Thought this band ended🥲
i have got to listen to there older tracks since this one is so fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ya necesitabamos una buena dosis de droga musical de estos. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🎶
finalmente mano!!! já faziam 80 anos (6 anos na vdd kkk) alegria :)
John's return ❤️🛐🇧🇷
Es muy loco como me suena familiar el tema, como si ya hace años lo hubiera escuchado. Los red hot son unicos
Love it
All is right in the world…John is back and it makes my soul rejoice
jojo
Feels good to hear some new RHCP❤️🌶
Masters RHCP 🇨🇴.
Lets break the other genres...record views n likes 👍🏻 oh no!! Hold on..no fancy cars..no crappy lyrics n music.. no gals with 👙.. impossible task!!
Anthony, what’s up with the auto tune hard R?
Will Ferrel rocks!
OMAIGAAAAAAD!!!! ESTO ES HERMOSO  LOVE JOHN FRUSCIANTE!!!! THIS SHITS SOUNDS LIKE HENDRIX I LOVE IT
el unico que en 2022 sigue usando un mullet
John finally came back with the milk. And glad, they kept Will Ferrell on drums.
Woohoo!!! ❤🇵🇭
Back to the BEST sound!
what kinda spf do you need to protect your skin against all of those suns at the end
I've been waiting to see them soon in Barcelona
This is an amazing listen. I’m a Long time fan of the chillies and John is my idol. This song is completely fitting and is composed in such a way as to compliment his rebirth into the band. His presence here doesn’t portray any sort of over powering influence or intent to control the vibe, but instead is a beautiful display of his musical ability and chemistry with the rest of the band. The progression throughout this song is soul pleasing, the variation in dynamic sounds holds your interest and anticipation without being overpowering or off putting, and the way that heavenly melodies seem to effortlessly poor from John’s inner being is nothing short of raw, indisputable art. I believe he brings the sound of rhcp’s full circle. I’m very much looking forward to the release of the rest of their album and their tour in June.
Diego lives forever !!
That was great, musically polished band for sure.
@2:13 wow
BLACK SUMMER já é um clássico !!!
Anthony Kiedis looking like Iggy Pop.
RHCP shine to their fullest when John is on board 🤟
Are you cool? lol
What's with kiedis bizarre new accent
I never felt so glad i didn't die after 2009
😌 ahhh good to see Joe exotic and Will Ferrel together again
El inconfundible sonido de Frusciante que hace que cada cancion de rhcp sea una Bomba!! Larga vida RHCP!!
It’s like he never left. Seamless!
Mid, but order is restored.
Nunca dejen de hacer música.
Love it!
Esse som nos transporta direto aos anos 90'... Incrível como a sincronia dos tiuzões continua perfeita! John F. nasceu para estar nessa banda sem sobra de dúvidas!
Sounds so similar to their older albums.  Also, feels good to hear Frusciante's backing vocals.
Simplesmente Red Hot Chili Peppers sendo Red Hot Chili Peppers 💙🤍🖤☠️🎸
Breath of fresh air, so great to have this quality music in this times we are living in, where I can't even listen to the radio no more. Legendary and iconic RHCP!
just don't get the moustache though
The band that never lets me down.
Love the song. Video is…aight

I love them, but to be honest i was hoping for something a lil different. No trace of frusciante's jungle influences, a pop song that is very far from what a real fan would expect from them, especially after John came back. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice tune, but way too forgettable and not memorable. I own every album they ever released besides the horrible one from a few years back, plus i own frusciante's discography, from niandra to maya. I am disappointed
Legendary
Çook güzeel
Well the've finally managed to cover themselves - bssm weeps trapped in a time loop.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
These guys have certainly put an end to the black summer with this song. What a banger! More love to you guys & cheers to all the RHCP fans who've been waiting for a fresh release from these guys
Forgettable song. The band's a shadow of its former self.
O bom filho a casa torna.
I dont like how hes singing not gonna lie
Miss you so 😍
GBC 🖤🇧🇴
golden team
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hein ? Des faux airs de Jethro Tull  !!?
Frusciante's vocals are everything ❤
Welcome back jhon🤘🤘 Greetings from the Philippines❤️
Yes 🙌
It's like......very old music for old men....Nothing interesting
That Frusciante sound is back
The lineup we all deserve!
🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥🔥
Produced so pure and sounding so incredibly good. but then - Anthony autotuned? Really?
I think they picked a great song to welcome Johnny back. It feels very reborn, nostalgic, and yet heavy with destiny to move forward, you know? The song’s sound and the video’s visuals really tap into how much I missed John without even realizing it (because I loved Josh). It made me really emotional lol.  Also, heavy props to the cinematography, particularly in relation to the grand reveal of Johnny’s return. It paced out to show the other members first, and then when it finally gets to John it starts at like his knees and slowly moves up.
dark winter, black summer...
who said red hot chili peppers are over?? it's immortal especially with the return of the god of the guitar Mr. John Frusciante
CUANDo GIRA MUNDIAL ALABURGER
🇺🇦 love RHCP✌
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Diego Verdaguer descansa en paz, gracias por dejar tu última canción en video 👐🏻
why does it sound weird when he says archer and dark
Like it when you dislike it
Haaaaa Que saudades ❤️❤️❤️
Wait, something doesn’t feel right….  1:26 oh here we go
yeah, what I've been waiting for has finally come 🔥🔥
the best feeling ever is to hear you all preform again i love you so much there arent enough words to even explayn this your music helped me so much
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
John Frusciante BEST:)
joooooohn!!!!!!!! from japan
16 years.... that sound was so missed. Thank you.
As happy as i am to see John back with the guys but i can't help to think about Josh.  As much as it was hard for Josh to step in John shoes, i can say the same for John. Josh is definitely a hard act to follow. Remember Dark necessities or the longest wave.  Yeah man, such an irony ..  Good luck John but this song to me isn't it. It seems as if iv put RHCP songs in a computer and asked the computer to generate a song based on those songs. And it gave me a generic type trash. Sorry Red Hot, i need to be truthful. I still love you guys but dont just do it for the sake of doing it. Think out of the box. Or just get Josh back as your second guitarist. My humble take on all this. Thanks guys
Viejos sabrosos
❤
Perfect performance ❤️👽
Garbage
Why is Kiedis looking like Dr. Disrespect
Maravilhoso !!!
Absolute legends")
Its Not enough
🤘🏼🔥🌶
es genial ver a John de nuevo en la banda, su solo fue genial. Vivan los peppers desde Colombia 🇨🇴
Pasan décadas y siguen haciendo arte diosmio 😩😩💗💗
volvieron super fuertes... GRACIAS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, SUPER HIT BLACK SUMMER
Wanted to like it so bad.  I can't be the only one who thinks this is horrible.

Nice song
How i've been waiting them to perform again like this?
✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️
YES.
Jesus loves you and He died for your sins
1:53
When your song is so awful you have to channel a leprechaun pirate. Now all it needs is Michael Bolton singing  a chorus about Jack Sparrow.  Hillel Slovak is rolling in his grave.
0:46
Faltó un buen falsete en el coro en la voz de frusciante
I guess the mullet is back with a vengeance.
Funky moon in ancient times the sun was god and the moon the girlfriend
Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers ✨ saludos desde México 🇲🇽💜
OH DAMN I LOVE YOU GUYS
Love this song
Not bad -   video needed some zombies though. 😁
Impresionante los Red Hot, como se nota que volvió John Frusciante, esperaba ese sonido de guitarra tan caracteristico de John
Agora o mundo voltou a girar normalmente! RHCP❤
This is so cool that they decided to do direct marketing.  This is one of the very few Google ads that I clicked through.
Thanks to god for John Frusciante!!
finally) I'll be waiting... new album
Guys...I LOVE YOU SO MUCH !!!
Stadium arcadium con más pedales y autotune. Hermoso
Percebemos a melhora que o John agrega na banda  Que incrível ver isso novamente 🥺🥺🤩
That guitar is so Josh.... It's so dandy.....
Yes, yes, yes, there is still a band that's not afraid to put that guitar solo in a song!!!! And pleeeeaaase never stop making music, RHCP!!!!!!
So amazing to see John back with the Chili Peppers.  <3 <3 <3 <3
Como eu tava esperando por isso, que energia!!! ❤
Es triste ver los estragos del tiempo, lo que no cambia es su nivel #RHCP
Frusciante is back!!!
Gracias carajo!
I love the new song <3
Glad you're back John <3 Greetings from Poland
👍🇬🇧
Heil liberals!
EL REGRESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love Josh guitars, but these 4 guys together r pretty unique.
temon loco
I love this song so far but is someone gonna tell Anthony he's not a pirate leprechaun
Son demasiado god
Как же прекрасно, что они просто есть. Никогда не пытались быть великими. Просто играли то, что умеют. Этакая национальная музыка Калифорнии, места, где всё у всех есть, стремиться настолько некуда, что нищим раздают чистые шприцы. Это музыка на грани счастья и отчаяния. То самое чувство, когда с утра уже все наркотики отпустили, ты сидишь на берегу океана, наблюдаешь рассвет и не знаешь что делать со всей этой вселенной. И даже зарыдать не можешь, настолько это больно и невыразимо.
This has been my favorite band my entire life, since I was 6 and singing along to Under the Bridge in my big brother's car. They still got it <3
This is some good rock man! Glad to see it
eu amo vocês
I CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO RECOGNIZED The guitar sound from Jimi Hendrix’s -Hey Baby!!!!!???
3.24 Чад Смит играет совсем не то, что звучит( Ну как так, монтажер клипа, Алё??!!! Перцам респект, однозначно!! Лучшие!
Amazing song. I loved every second of it. 🙌🙌🙌
anthony "possibly irish?" kiedis
YAAAAAS
Nice!
best band ever
I’m just stoked they got Will Ferrell back on drums
Even at their 50s my boys still kickin' ass 💯
Come o Brasil 😭😭😭
Me alegra ver esta música en tendencias
Absolutely epic. Strong song as per the usual Red Hot Chili Peppers standard. Stoked for new music. They haven't lost a step in the many years I've listened to them. RHCP for life.
Sitting on a sack of beans 🎶 sittin down in New Orleans 🎶 you won't believe what I seen .. sittin on a sack of beans 🎶  Rock on 🤘  RHCP 🌶 🫑 🌶 🫑 🌶 🫑 🌶 🫑 🌶
Desde que lo escuche no puedo parar 😍 Siempre salvandome de mi misma con su musica..me acompañaron en cada paso de mi vida desde los 11 años y en oportunidades fueron los únicos que calmaron mis penas🥺 gracias por existir 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Im so happy John Frusciante overcame addiction, truly gifted individual.
A melhor banda do mundo! Nunca perde a essência.
- [x] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!!!
Ayo this shit racist
VUELVE FRUSCIANTE, VUELVEN LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, QUE MÁS PODEMOS PEDIR
mds quando veio a notificaçao da musica ja começei de pular de alegria pra ouvir minha banda favorita de todos os tempos
Wait... is that Anthony Kiedis or Glenn Danzig? Fit.
Thank you so much, RHCP, this song si very important for me... It was a very bad year for me, but this song give me some kind of hapiness.. thank you so much
[  Meditation leads to awareness of telepathy, and awareness of telepathy leads to meditation.  ]  Honesty socially is more important than DOING to impress others. It’s not what we DO to build social value that matters. It’s the respect we are willing to give, as well as the authenticity and sincerity we have within our personalities. The ideas we choose to participate in matter most: they are either friendly or cruel socially. Material wealth, body size, facial features, or DOING will never create authority by default, which is the ability to pass judgments socially the most. Aristocratic men are hypocritical, cowardly, and jealous. Anger and zero accountability are not replacements for honesty and empathy. No one has control over ideas socially.  Authoritarianism is a shallow head game: the refusal to share honesty (friendship) socially. Men with negative intentions will show complete bias against ideas supporting emotional freedom, free thinking, and level states of being. Spiritual development, the focus away from the material and towards psychology (attraction) ONLY, is promoted as “not important” by conformist men with abusive or pragmatic personalities. Spiritual ideas immediately decentralize power, elevate mood, reduce manipulation, and eliminate leadership. Spirituality places much more emphasis on social inclusion, honesty, and collective consciousness. Authoritarians weaponize the material or development in it and use both as reasons to criticize and remain unfriendly (dishonest). Dishonesty is the only way the idea of power may exist. When friendship is seen as more important than power, material development is subservient to mood. When the material is used to boost self worth and reduce others socially, mood is subordinate to power.  Joyful ideas supporting free thinking (telepathy, cooperation, and honesty) encourage growth of the human persona, are anti-manipulative, and promote emotional harmony. Men focusing on the immaterial (personality) and on honesty (friendship) have more evolved minds compared to authoritarians consumed with leadership (power). In order to seek status, alphas intentionally remain closed-minded (materialistic), manipulative (controlling), and antagonistic (blame), while also forming intense judgments (jealousy) about more emotionally developed men. Men with mature minds are authentic with others, focus on humor, and shun the idea of emotional leverage. This makes them an unintentional threat socially to serious and conceited men with elitist personalities focused on dominance. Leadership is not warm, nor is it real. It is used in practice to reduce pride in others and to artificially boost feelings of self worth in an individual focused on social image only. Men focusing on telepathy are contradictory socially to alphas promoting leadership. Men with inherent worth (love for others) are offensive to men trying to prove worth (lack of belief in self) with material development.  All men know consciousness (Source) and possess a conscience. Possessing a conscience is knowing right from wrong, and refusing to lie about awareness. No man is exempt from understanding Source (love) within, and all of us know we are mentally connected. The idea of comparing human beings to unaware animals is cunning and manipulative. Alphas rely on shared lying socially about awareness in place of being honest (friendly). Character development is ignored with this psychology. Our feelings (thoughts and beliefs) are transmitted and shared vibrationally and mentally. In order to seek power, which is the intention to emotionally reduce others socially, men must feign unawareness of a conscience. Cruel ideas are deliberately participated in and broadcast mentally promoting social dominance. The willful focus on a friendly collective consciousness is a contrarian idea to human animals playing dumb. Being EQUAL TO in the mind socially IS secure, and the ONLY true expression of emotional security that exists. Authoritarians refuse to focus away from being unfair human animals, and remain consumed with social inequality. This forces an unrelaxed, emotionally tense environment driven by melodrama and contempt for others.   Alphas are mentally unstable, have manipulative personalities, and possess low feelings of self worth resulting from the intense focus on anger (authority), apathy (indifference), and advantages (dominance). Ideas rooted in mental dominance (alpha psychology) will never promote honesty (friendship). Alphas are homophobic, and are especially critical of friendly men that are emotionally developed. Men with empathy have already worked through insecurities and judgments to focus on telepathy. Prideful men that lie about insecurities seek control over feelings socially using blame and criticisms in order to maintain an image of being stronger. This creates artificial versions of emotional security and more value socially enforced with paranoia and anger. Resorting to vibrational attacks for the purpose of self promotion by reducing worth in others mentally leads to violence. Dominance over feelings is impossible, as we all share thinking. Men with emotional IQ are authentic socially and care about calm feelings more. We are all telepathic. There is no choice but to be level with others mentally, and to focus on the ultimate truth of what reality is (connection with Source). Evolved men refuse to criticize other people unprovoked or manipulate the truth. Alphas will always share critical thoughts about other people. Men with emotional depth focus on honesty socially more than alphas, creating non-violence.  The idea of a social hierarchy (human authority) is degrading and humiliating. It promotes closed-mindedness, fear, and the social inclusion of violence. Thoughtful men focusing on telepathy, and away from conformity, are judged relentlessly for having elevated emotions by alphas refusing to evolve. Lessor minds intentionally share cruel beliefs together promoting the social exclusion of men with empathy socializing positive. These men are mental only in focus, never play head games, and are level in the mind with all. Alphas seek emotional support and validation from each other socially, since the ideas they participate in are rooted in dishonor and physical aggression. Alphas judge honest (friendly) men the most, as they focus away from arrogance entirely, and expect friendship to be returned socially. Passing excessive, unprovoked judgments (authoritarianism) on a better psychology, wavelength, and state of being is jealousy. These criticisms always relate to social harmony and non-violence. Alphas rely on power of numbers to manipulate the truth and to keep primal ideas popular that are intentionally threatening towards men that have already focused away from machismo (lying and fear), and towards telepathy, honesty, and Source. Authoritarians will always promote vibrational attacks against men that have already grown past them in thinking, resulting in petty head games socially.  Intelligence is always associated with emotional IQ, and emotional IQ has a direct correlation to the mental focus on social equality. Social equality can only result from honesty (friendship) within the mind. The reason men chose to be honest is because they are aware telepathy is real. It looks stupid to lie about it. Alphas primarily focus on dominance in the material and social image, and focus entirely away telepathy. This reduces their emotional IQ socially. Because of this, alphas will always feel inferior to more honest (friendly) men. Alphas must always focus on acting skills to socialize, since the inner persona is focused only on criticisms, violence, and dishonesty. This creates a shallow personality with a dumb vibe. Forceful thinking men will always share jealousy with men sharing respect with more emotional depth. Only men with emotional IQ can form real personas vibrationally that are not shallow. It is only when the inner mind matches the outer persona that a human being can be likable socially. Shallow men are associated with lying and are not respected when it comes to intelligence, creating situations where they are avoided socially. This angers the minds of men possessing a lower psychology, which often creates unprovoked violent reactions. When thinking is focused on honesty, feelings radiate soft. When thinking is focused on lying, feelings radiate threatening.  Machismo and compassion are polar opposites. Machismo will never allow for healing to occur, while compassion is the promotion of both healing and emotional growth. Men focused on compassion will always outsmart less mature men with arrogance sharing no respect. Men will either allow healing (level thinking) to occur socially, or they will attempt to take away pride from others to artificially boost feelings of self worth. Alphas will always attempt to seek an image of more value socially by cheating (violence, greed, or leadership). Judgements from personalities with machismo usually have little substance. Only judgments relating to character issues (dishonesty), violence, or an excessively critical mind have real substance. Passing judgments on men for being honest (friendly) is shallow, arrogant, and completely against the development of our collective consciousness socially. Judgments from alphas are hypocritical, cruel, and reside in dishonor. Shallow judgments from authoritarians will always lead to drama, social inequality, and violence. Alphas focus intensely on cutting other men down unfairly in order to promote a better social image, calling it competitive.  It’s time for human beings to let go of classism (psychic warfare) for good. It is jealousy. Secure men are level in the mind and easy to get along with. Alphas resort to conniving and childish head games. Men that focus non-violent and refuse to lie evolve.  [  End drama.  ]  https://youtu.be/hHcIOwgOHqk  z
Que som...
Carlito où es-tu ?
this sounds good but why the fuck is he singing with a irish accent?
Beautiful song 🤘🤘 thanks Chili Peppers 🌶
Baita guitarrista, toca simples e com criatividade, faz solos poderosos sem firulas.
The new song sucks xD
Tantos años esperando por este épico momento 🥰
Lindos ... ♥♥♥
01:14  no luchaste por ese Crash ahí Chad! igual queda mejor sin.
It's like a dead artist come back to give us a beatifull gift. I love RHCP
it's damn good they're back!🔥🔥🔥👌
Indonesia here
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Frusciante=Messias 🙏🛐🤲
My one-and-a-half year old daughter enjoyed your song. :)
Uhuuuuulll!!! Nem parece que o John esteve 10 anos longe da banda 😃♥️🥲
Anthony- listens to Irish folk once = " I'll do a.... Newweee voice"
Frusciante❤️‍🔥📢🔉🔉*
Magic ❤
1. It's not Chad's job to be technical, it's to set a groove. They're not some math-metal band. 2. Maybe they want to play what they enjoy, rather than whatever era your brain is stuck in
O amor que eu tenho por essa banda é inexplicável!! Que momento único, gente, que momento! Os 4 amores da minha vida juntos novamente, que momento! Eu me emociono toda vez que vejo esse clipe!
They still got it
I swear I ain’t religious but Jesus is back.
Anthony sounds like an Irish man. Been a RHCP fan since the 80’S and this sucks!!!!
Puta que estamos viejos......
I like to sing one of the choruses of this instaclassic like this..."been a long time since i never knew when... now i'm waitin for another black summer to end!"
Love this video guys!
I cant believe Will Ferrell is still in the band after all these years. Pretty good at doing two jobs.
Thank you guys, this is magic*
Sounds like Anthony Kiedis is channeling his inner Gordon Lightfoot in the verses😂
hell yeah, finally, the rhcp with John frusciante again
Estos si son regresos, después de muchos años mantienen su esencia intacta, buena. ⚫️☀️
Is that Will Ferrell on drums?
Não sei o que dizer, só sentir. hahaha Amo demais! Que emoção vê-los juntos novamente. ❤🇧🇷  Anthony, eu te amo ❤️
John is back 🔥🔥🔥
Great song, rock on
This feels right. It was never the same without Frusciante
Olha o Brabo, John!!! 🇧🇷
Idk why they keep taking Fruschante bacK, dudes flaked on them so many times.
Is Anthony a GOD?!?! Look at THAT BODY!!! 😯😍 His is 59! 🙌 Unbelievable!!
Good to see Will Ferrell still tricking us on the drums
Absolutely amazing keep it up you guys, keeping alive the classic rock music
I think the music video is great 👍

Thank you to make me feel the MUSIC.

Mhhmmmmm💆‍♀️💆‍♀️
SI los amo. Forever
Same old tune
I was waiting for THIS since 2006...16 years to hear RED HOT againb <3 <3 <3 I FUCKING LOVE YO JOHN WELCOME BACK TO YOUR PLACE DUDE!!!
Perdi as contas de quantas vezes já ouvi!
Подражать им бессмысленно. Старики круты в своем деле.)
🌟People saying this is their greatest have lost their fking minds.  This song isn't even their top 40 of songs. I get that you silly bastards are fanboying out in cringe ways, but get a pill. You're nuts.
The best groupe california
Very good one.
John Frusciante. God.
4 Kings ruling rock n roll
Nice song

Наконец.-то!!!
RHCP have such an astounding timeless chemistry of tone, technique, talent, and songwriting. Having followed them since 1987, it's no surprise to see their longevity successfully evolve while remaining loyal to their fanbase. Great to see John recording again as he adds a delectable gift to the band.

The mustache creeps me out.
Los amo Red Hot Chili Peppers 😭😭🖤🖤🖤🖤
I remember when the Chili Peppers were an awesome funk band, now all they do is sucky pop ballads. Too much herion.
Frusciante
Incredible how the Peppers still touch the right strings in my heart 💓.
Tão velhooss hein
👏👏👍👍👍
Yeah! Keanu Reeves is finally back with the Peppers!

And another borring pointless copy of the previous 100 RHCP songs. Where can i donate some $$ , so Kiedis can finally buy a shirt?
😍❤️
Sounds too much like Hwy 666 corey taylor
Se me salen las lágrimas viendo a Jhon tocando con los peppers, gracias Dios por permitirme verlos juntos de nuevo 🥲
🔥🔥🔥

Man I love this Stand
Can't say this is the best lyrics Anthony has ever put out, and oof those dance moves. But having John back in the band, hearing that unmistakable sound, it's amazing.
Increíble solo de Frusciante 🤠
Can definitely tell John is back baby!! 👌🤘🤙💪👍
GODS
Sun go bombom
Anthony's rocking a definite Sonny Bono look. Nice!
Лучше этого не могло ничего произойти …. 💔
Simplesmente incrível o clipe
Cover yourself Anthony, have some class in getting older!
Dammit. STILL with the moustache. Cringe. They sound good though.
I'm so glad they're still making music ❤️
Perfect song
This Band i think its the only One that didnt change its roots through years thats great for such a great Band greetings from Perú
These guys need to sit down
Boooooring
La esencia Red Hot, que hace años no se sentía. Gracias Frusciante por volver y resucitar la banda. Ídolo. Sonido clásico y moderno a la vez. 🔥
Los quiero mucho, gracias por existir
Who else was in their top 0.5% of listeners on spotify last year?
This song could perfectly fit into stadium arcadium.
Thank for red hot chili peppers
i like that the music video is just them doing whatever they like infront of a greenscreen haha
Jeepers Creepers!  Is that Needles?
Vibras a californication ufffff me encantó:")
We desperately need music like this back in our lives

They have 2 songs...over and over and over again.
Я начала тащиться от группы примерно с 99го со школы, сейчас два сына обожают их❤ Младшему 7лет, уж очень ждёт, чтоб они выступили в Питере или в Москве🌶🎸💥🔥❤ Джон Фрушанте с возвращением!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥❤
achei preguiçosa essa musica. podia ser mais massa.
It´s been a long time that I didn´t hear a new song from RHCP
Al fin encuentro algo digno de estar en tendencias🔥🔥👏👏👏
1:55 why is flea walking like Gollum with a paintbrush. He is so unique and such a free spirit ! Love him 😂😂😂😛🤟🏻
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
красавцы, и тему поднимают важную
PORFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
This song puts a huge smile on my face every time I listen to it. Not just because John is back, but because you can feel positive, nostalgic, and happy energy resonating from the music. And also, it's no surprise how quickly and creatively the four of them are writing together. I'm so excited to hear what else they've written. I love you, RHCP! You guys fucking rock!
Rhcp never gets old, bring the same vibe everytime on their every song
Yo the boys are back! Welcome
Поздравляю всех фанов из СНГ с возвращением наших любимых РХЧП!!!🙏🙏🙏😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️  Джон Фрушанте волшебник!!!🔥🔥🔥 Вернул звучание, которое нам так не хватало!!!
21 Years in Love with the Chilis <3
Wooouuu!! Que rooloota!! Yeaa. Alineacion de lujo con frusciante de regreso..👌
Cómo pasan los años dicen las arrugas.
Appreciated Joshes time with the band, but really glad to see Frusciante back. John’s chemistry with RHCP, is irreplaceable. Missed you John!
The OG's bringing their A game
Absolutely awesome! 😎

Wow. Nice. You guys own it. Song's gonna be stuck in my brain for awhile now..I can be in such a dark place, but RCHP gets me outta that place. Rock on my brothers.
Crying :')
John, the greatest ever. So happy he’s back. This is a special moment.
Finalmente
glad some guys still make real music. god bless them
Que retorno!!!! Vida longa aos Chili Peppers !!

COMO LOS EXTRAÑE LPM NO TIENE SENTIDO EL TEMA
Love from Portugal ❤️❤️❤️
LONDON IN THE SUMMERTIME
❤❤❤❤
Me duele no poder estar en esta gira :(
Esa guitarra Yam red hot! La única
Ese solo 😍 ...... Estos 4 juntos son dinamita pura...
Están de vuelta!
Nothing against Josh, but this is RHCP! It feels like 2006 again bois!!
The Peppers drought is over with John back! The California drought lingers.
I love this chili pepper 🤘🏼🔥🤘🏼
Nostálgico !!! Isso é RHCP ! 🔥🔥🔥
Jhonn Is back 😁
Que diferença faz o Red Hot com o John!! Os 4 juntos são como arroz e feijão, um não é a mesma coisa sem o outro rsrs
Tradução da Letra:  Eu sou uma chuva preguiçosa  O céu se recusa a chorar  A cremação pega o pedaço de sua oferta  A noite está vestida como meio-dia  Um marinheiro falou cedo demais  E a China está no lado sombrio da lua    (Manda a ver agora)    O ornitorrinco são poucos  A vida secreta do guru  Uma personalidade que eu nunca conheci  (Pegue)  Minha Greta pesa uma tonelada  Os arqueiros estão em fuga  E ninguém fica sozinho atrás do sol    Já faz um bom tempo desde que eu fiz um novo amigo  Esperando que mais um verão sombrio termine  Já faz um bom tempo e nunca se sabe quando  Esperar que mais um verão sombrio termine    Quebre o chicote flamejante  Navegando em uma censura  Montando em um cavalo sem cabeça para fazer a viagem    Já faz um bom tempo desde que eu fiz um novo amigo  Esperando que mais um verão sombrio termine  Já faz um bom tempo e nunca se sabe quando  Esperar que mais um verão sombrio termine    Estou esperando  Estou esperando  Esperando que mais um verão sombrio termine  Estou esperando  Estou esperando  Esperando que mais um verão sombrio termine  Estou esperando  Estou esperando  Esperando que mais um verão sombrio termine
They are back baby!
Hmmm... disappointing...the weird accent? The drum sound is also really bad, almost sounds like me playing on my electronic kit lol, Chad is my favourite drummer but the patterns here seem kinda the thing an amateur would do? Bass needs to be a bit more prominent too imo...just seems like the getaway or I'm with you but with frusciante, none of the magic of their older stuff!!
Que placer volver a escuchar a John Frusciante con los RHCP!!!
🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸Red Hot Chili Peppers 💙🤍🖤
Great song but Anthony's vocals are weird "Duuurk side of the moon?" No its Daaaark....lol Now I have to hear that every time? I love Chads drums sounding near identical to Californication production. Sounds like same snare...
I thought joe exotic was still in prison. He looks great!
GRACIAS 🙌🇦🇷
Welcome home, John!!!
Been a fan since 1985,  saw them in LA  probably 20 times. Sorry,  but  This is the same  stale sound I have heard the last 20 years. It sounds exactly like I expected. I dont expect a ground breaking , new different sound, but every single person reading what I am writing knows that  the Chili peppers are just going through the motions at this point.  and WTF is Kiedis  new Irish accent??   lol  kids might love this, but old school fans have heard this same song for 20+ years.  5 out of ten .CHEERS
Que gran canción :)
En el segundo coro , te das cuenta que siguen siendo los red hot.🌶️
Yes!! JUICY!!! Can't wait to see you guys in Nashville!!! <3
Is it me or does the beginning sound like a slower version of their song This Velvet Glove?
this is a great track
This will be the most listend hard rock song of 2022.  🤘
GRANDE, muy buena rolita! Para reflexionar sobre el daño que estamos haciéndole a nuestro planeta. Bueno, a mí eso me transmite la canción.
...And God Bless, John Frusciante. Electric Jesus is back.
Espero verlos en vivo algun dia Peppers!!

Confesso que fiquei muito emocionado ao ouvir essa música nova deles duas horas depois de ser lançado,com a volta de Frusciante eles ficaram mais fortes,vida longa ao chili peppers.

RHCP is dead since One Hot Minute
Anthony's body at 59 years old
amazin as always 💗💗💗🧷
Anthony Keidis just ripped off the acoustic version of “the number of the beast” from the Film “Spun”s opening credits. Good job, thief. Love You John Frusciante!
essa música é simplesmente perfeita
Tiger King?
when a pople ask to you "what is perfection?" show this clip
Emerson lake and Palmer, Jethro Tull and Beatles plagio....warning.... 🌝
Nice, that you are back. See you in Werchter.
I can't get past the amount of auto tune on Anthony's vocals. I hope that's just an effect for this song. I'd rather hear him sing out of tune than sound like a robot.
Cria 🤠👍
Frusciante that sound 🤌
Red hot chili peppers is back , lo de siempre , pero que lindo suena y a esta altura que mas podemos esperar , mientras tenga calidad , bienvenido sea .
This is just my opinion, but these are the worst lyrics they’ve put out yet. John Flea and Chad kill it as always though. They should start an instrumental group.
Back to the argentina pliz
Good ol days r back...🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘 Happy to see  genius  JOHN frusciante  back with  RHCP..🤘
Seeing these two four dudes coming together again makes me feel like a kid again
YES the Peppers still got it! Thank you! 🌶❤️🌶❤️🌶❤️ Anthony still ripped like a mother…..Flea boy too
April 1st is actually my brithday 😄 This is the best birthday present ever
This feels like we have be waiting 16 years for a RHCP new album…and finally gotten 🙂❤️ John is back and Rubin as producer 💯 magic 🪄…❤️🔥PERFECTION
John Frusciante coming back to the band is like the third coming of Christ
Antonio le decimos a anthony kidis aca en mi pais argentina esperemos vuelvan x el pais del fin del mundo saludos gracias fruciante x volver
People are still talking about COVID, when God is back in the gang...
Increíble, los mejores Red Hot Chili Peppers 😎❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
PUTA QUE PARIU QUE PEDRADA. FRUSCIANTE TRAZ OUTRO ESPÍRITO PRA BANDA. <3 <3
Welcome back john! ♥️
Que bueno que volviste, John, necesitaba verte en los Red Hot!!!
Damn. Frusciante makes alll the difference.
🤘🤘🤘
Glad to see Will Ferrell behind a drum kit again
Is that a JoJo reference
💜💜💜💜💜💯💯💯💯🙌🙌🙌🙌
Three words.  Give It Up.  This seriously Sucks!!!
Omg ❤  it's so good feeling to see you all again! ❤
Infelizmente bem fraca essa música, pra quem tem uns dos melhores baixista do mundo , merecia mais
!!!!!
They are making the same song over and over again
Now that I've sang my praises...I HATE FAKE HOLLYWOOD GREEN SCREEN VIDEOS. Who is calling these shots? 4 Literal artists are in your band...
The only happiness in my life right now
Today is my Birthday. What a beautiful gift this song is!
Man it's good to have you back John
3:33 a ghost hit your cymbals
Ever since listen 1 I can't figure out why after solo 1, he didn't double w/acoustic guitar. I'm led to believe (NME article) that John was worried about his playing on this song (so they made it the first single.) Also 100 songs recorded, 50 "Probably will be released in small batches"...JOhn is more excited about the 2nd "album" it's completely different.
La canción suena tan John
Rock will never sound like it did 🥺
Los peppers :3
COME TO BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷 RHCP
Dammit Anthony using his AI lyrics generator again!
Simplesmente Red Hot Chilli "FUCKING" Peppers!!!
I bet a lot of people don't realize that these guys technically speaking have been performing for approximately 40 years now, roughly speaking from when they 1st started. When Anthony and Flea basically met in high school!
La letra en mi opinión, el tema desvela un trasfondo de las personas que sufren depresión, ansiedad y miedos internos que terminan  encerrándolos en ellos mismos y que intentan salir de ese "verano oscuro" que parece nunca tener fin
Бля! Какая классная песня!!!
The guitar would sound better if it was plugged in
1:52 as Rick Beato once said about Nirvana's Smell like teen spirit - you can't never go wrong with playing the melody :)
My childhood band! Happy to see these guys performing again, Great Song!
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
I’ve seen the Red Hot Chili Peppers twice but I have yet to see them with John Frusciante.  I can die happy if I get to see them all together.
Anthony will look better shirtless at age 80 than I'll ever do anytime in my life.
ı love you baby I LOVE YOUUUU
I believe that there’s a magical Cupid type of angel that shoot darts to certain people who go through hard times and in return they have a gift whether a musical gift or poetic gift with words and it’s all put together for something hot spicy to make life just a little bit more Susie. The red hot chili peppers never get old. Thank you John for joining on another trip. Can’t wait to see you guys again this summer🙏
Fantastic song as usual. Tbh I don’t think I’ll dislike any song on the album considering they were all written by Chad Flea Anthony John and Rubin…
RHCP Always winning!!!
I'll be honest, it's good. Not like "hit-me-in-the-face" great like their previous 1st singles though. I see Anthony's singing better now, but whatup with that country twang though? 😄 Sounds like they've gone back to "Stadium Arcadium" territory, which isn't a bad thing. I hope the 2nd and maybe 3rd single will rock even harder and hit me like I know the Peppers can. I'm just happy to see John back in the mix. He's the perfect guitarist for them. Can't wait to see them live this summer.
Can't believe they're finally back! We all waited for this! Love it 🥰
Sad to see them getting old..😔😔 Happy to listen to them again 😊❤️❤️ John is back❤️... Waiting for the album🔥🔥
Quanto mais a gente vê mais a gente gosta!!!! A gente AMA muuuuito RHCP!!!!! 💓💓💓💓💓🇧🇷
Thank you 🙏
Different and yet very familiar, especially the bass, drumming and vocals. Hopefully the rest of the album is a bit more new in direction.
RHCP allways the best of the best. Big hug from Bosnia

Waiting another stimulus

1:51 hell yes

Wow...... Realmente emocionada con este tema, es impactante lo que m causa cuando los escucho

Maravilloso, sin palabras.
Your ear feel like reborn

Felicidade não cabe no peito ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Neat
Welcome Home John :))
Man it feels like a Christmas seeing new song from RHCP with John 🎸
Los amooo tanto ❤️
senhoras e senhores, eu estou emocionada
Solo 1:52 2:10 2:32 3:07
Didnt know Machete was the lead singer of this band! 🤣
The lyrics make no sense
I love RHCP FC from Thailand.
Although it’s a bit underwhelming for a first single 16 years after the last JF album, the more I listen to it, the more I like it and the chorus is definitely stuck in my head. The 2 things I think would’ve made it better (and I’m not claiming to be an expert) is 1: If Anthony didn’t have that odd Irish-sounding accent on the verses, and 2: of the second verse was sung an octave higher like the verses of My Friends or Otherside. The song builds nicely with guitar, then vocals, then bass, then drums. When the drums kick in, I’d like to see a little progression in the intensity of singing and the guitar playing. Only a slight change would make a huge difference and make it more interesting. As it is, it takes a minute and a half to really get into the song.
Ну наконец они вернулись!!! Частичка рока, гении музыки и конечно же Джон!!!❤
お願いだから日本来て🙇‍♂️‼️
Their souls are still so young
Nice!
Congratulations RHCP, a new road starts in music in general thanks to you, very musical melodies, you are a true hit creators.
This song reminds me of Slow Cheetah
It's a decent song. It's not  hugely ground breaking like their SLSM album or previous songs/ albumd.    The song followd the pretty standard modern RHCP formula.  Black summer doesn't necessarily jump out and grab you but at the same time its not a completely forgettable filler track . It's good to see John back .......again for the 2nd or 3rd time. His soloing was the best part of the track. It had all the things that make up a great RHCP solo and shows his signature style/sound.            It sounded like Anthony was singing in some weird backwoods hick/Canadian accent at times. I wish he would ditch his bowlcut mullet with mustache look.
Manito arriba los que son de Perú carajo... Red Hot Chili Peppers Forever 🇵🇪✌🙃✌🎧
Como e bom ver o John novamente na banda
oal boa noite bom dia tauo doaksoadka oi gente legal hahaha tenha uma tarde otima hehehaha
Decepcionante, infelizmente decepcionante!
Let's sing with the Red Hot Chili Peppers  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry  Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon  A sailor spoke too soon  And China's on the dark side of the moon  Hear me now  Platypus are a few  The secret life of Roo  A personality I never knew  Get it on My crater weighs a ton  The archer's on the run  And no one stands alone behind the sun   It's been a long time since I made a new friend  Waiting on another black summer to end  It's been a long time and you never know when  Waiting on another black summer to end   Back the flaming whip  Are sailing on our censorship  Riding on a headless horse to make the trip   It's been a long time since I made a new friend  Waiting on another black summer to end  It's been a long time and you never know when  Waiting on another black summer to end   I've been waiting I've been waiting  Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting  I've been waiting  Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting  I've been waiting  Waiting on another black summer to end
Why are they inside the soul stone?
No me sorprende que RHCP me sorprenda nuevamente con buena musica!
inacabables , eternos!!!

HERMOSA LA BALLENA QUE NAVEGA EN EL FONDO
Mrd !! como no se puede dar más likes a este pedazo de canción que nos regalan después de tantos años crjo !!!
Been looking forward to this. The song has a nice Chili Peppers vibe but I'm not much on Anthony's vocals, not sure what he's trying to do with the accent. It ruins the song for me. Not even gonna talk about his hair and stache lol. The chorus sounds like normal Chili Peppers though. Hope the rest of the album he sounds like himself.
OK, even RHCP started using autotune, so sad :/  The song itself is great though.
This song sucks what a discrace to red hot chili peppers
Iggy Pop looks younger
Is no one gonna mention that Kiedis looks like Tiger King?
WOW cool
Aeee!!! Incríveis como sempre, meu Deus isso está perfeito e nostálgico. #RHCP❣
❤‍🩹
Let’s not forget three of these guys are getting into their 60’s. I’d be proud to be doing this at that age. That’s a hell of a career they’ve had.
The Song sounds good, but I'm not of enough drugs to enjoy the video.
Dang, these guys are good, aren't they!
aí sim
Fuck yeah…welcome back Johnny
RHCP are back 🔥
I wonder what Neil Hamburger would have to say about this gem.
Eternally cool
Cool
John 😍😍😍😍😍
@0:46 & @0:56 I never thought I'd be so happy to see Jesus and Will Ferrell back together again.
This song reminds me ,the first ear under the Bridge

Amazing - you got it !!!
A formação perfeita que nunca deveria ter sido desfeita! Come To Brazil!! 🇧🇷 Love You, Guy’s! 🤘
Zajebisty kawałek.
I though this guitar guy is overdosed long ago

Bıkmadan dinlenir... Sesiniz buralara geldi 🇹🇷
McGonagall voice: Frusciante, it's good to see you
I was born in to wrong generation, bring me back to these times where music was good.
🤟🏻🔥
So much Saturn worship in this.. you gotta kill your heros man. These people aren't your friends
Keanu has really upped his musicianship since Dogstar.
"Choinas uurn thuur derk seid uurv thur moown!"
Why does Kiedis sound canadian?
OM they are back! Frusciante style! Finally! Thanks for this comeback!
Simplesmente amo , amo RHCP ❤❤
this song is already legendary
this sounds similar to Lorde's mood ring song
de la csm !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sure this album is more successful than stadium arcadium album
Anthony is Irish now?!?
22 years in love with you and counting
FODA!!!
Welcomback
wow
We should be thankful to see them together again
Танцы с голым торсом в 60 - РХЧП

The world is a better place today, thanks to Mr. Frusciante.
I’m sorry y’all but this isn’t it
Quelle fadeur. Gesticulations sur un titre qui n'a aucune énergie ni saveur. Les red  hot ne sont plus, et ce, depuis bien longtemps
Obra Prima, que delicia de sooom pqp

🤘😎🔥
Europe is waiting for you :D ✌️🤘
Let's go Frusciante!! Glad to see them all again.
THEY. ARE. BACK! This is the fucking chili peppers bruh!!!
It's been a long time since there was good music. they are back and they are very promising. blessed I learned them from my big brother.
🤟🤟🤟🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Slow mellow that's a good start for new performs!
I missed you guys so much!! This song is wonderful!! ❤️

Su majestad Silverio ¿eres tú?
Это заебись!
frusciante 🤘
I know it's probably cliché to say but....it seems like this picks up where stadium arcadium left off. I'm excited to see what else this album has on it!
Isso é música de qualidade 🔥
Is this off the new album
THESE GUYS JUST CANT MISS 🤘🏽
Anthony is 59 years old and shredded AF! I really love them together also!!!
Is this off the new album
It's meh😅 But love them
Thanks for save my life
Immortal
Well.. Kiedis sounds and looks outdated, Smith plays the same beat he always plays, but damn is it effective! Flea , cool as always, and i have to say, seing Frusciante again touched a special string in my heart...dude looks exactly as he did 20 years ago!!!
No es una canción con mucha potencia o mucho funk lo que caracteriza a los Chili Peppers. Pero es un linda canción que te trae vibras nostálgicas.
Can’t wait to see you guys in September!!!
Can't wait for your gig in Israel again!!
BUENO LA VERDAD QUE NO ESTAMAL PERO YO NO ESPERABA QUE SOLO NO ESTE MAL ESPERABA ALGO GRANDIOSO Y  RECIEN GUGLEE 'EN QUE ALBUMES TOCABA SLOVAK' Y ME DI CUENTA QUE FREAKY STAILI Y THE UFO MORFO PARTY PLAN SON LOS QUE MAS SIENTO DE ENERGIA PEPPERIANA Y LUEGO PENSE TAMBIEN QUE MI CD FAV ES ONE HOT MINUTE ESE QUE ESTA NAVARRO VIERON Y BUENO ENTONCES ME DI CUENTA QUE CLAR!!! NO ME GUSTA FRUSCIANTE ASI QUE BUENO, IMAGINATE QUE SI NO ME CEBABA TANTO IMAGINATE AHORA QUE TIENE COMO 60 AÑOS YA FUE ANTHONY SINCERAMENT SI SE SACARA EL BIGOTE POR AHI LAS COSAS SERIAN MEJORES PERO BUENO UNO ES DUEÑO DE SU VIDA Y SI QUIEREN SEGUIR HACIENDO POP ESTA BIEN PORQUE YA TIENEN COMO 80 BESOS
Siempre te recordaremos, Diego Verdaguer
Que bonito es verlos a los 4 por fin 💜
🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm so happy ❤️
I've had this song on repeat since yesterday. I can't get enough of John's fuzz solo. I want more😀👍👌💯
Welcome back muchachos! I want to wear Flea's poncho 🇦🇷
Кидис не старей пожалуйста
Pensé que Diego Verdaguer había fallecido 🤔
Thankfully i am blind....
Old times come back again !!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Things might just be alright after all.
Nothing like John Frusciante on guitar for RHCP. It’s like medicine for my soul. my heart was like “…..and away we go” when I heard chad’s crispy, sparkly drums come along with johns backing vocals, Anthony’s iconic voice and flea just jamming tf out. I’ve been waiting for this since Stadium Arcadium tbh
👍🦶👍🦶👍🦶🤌💪😘
Idol
The second coming of Christ…
Do u realize this band durvived 90s 00s ,10s and 20s and late 80s ... Many years and still like youth...
Who is from 2022 here?
Soooo...hes Chinese now? Kung Fu?
John is back after 14 years. And he proves in just one song that he is THE perfect guitarist for the Red Hot. John is God !!!
Weirdos
Keanu Reeves walking on water and playing guitar is the best thing I've ever seen
John is guitar God
Seeing everyone back together again and listening to frusciante play is so great I can’t wait to see these guys in Chicago in august
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK BOYSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
На конец
Will Ferrell is killing it on the drums!
so happy frusciante is back!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is  a pleasure listen and see them again ♡
Welcome back, John
Son lo máximo,  gracias por esta nueva joya de canción 🎸😎
why so many auto tune on anthony's voice...? kind of awkward, spoil a bit the song
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Ayyy look who's back
Anthony needs to shave that dirty stache off and Flea needs to knock off the goofball antics. Time to get serious in your mature golden years boys. Banger of a tune though!
Nothing against Josh, but John just belongs in this band.  They make their best music when he’s with them.
Душевненько 🌶
Godfirst #whospink? #4korners

Oh man Frusciante is just fucking something!!!! So glad to see him back and healthy. Great song. I’m looking forward to the album
Anthony sounds very Canadian in this song.
Anthony: is a boxer now Flea: hippie  John: same shirt since 1991  Chad: close to retiring from painting houses

Oh shit 😍
I discovered you in 1992. You are my favorite band. Your music is always in my life since my teenagehood.  Your music is the soundtrack of my life.
Been such a while since we've heard a JF solo. So excited for the new album! 17 tracks, 73 minutes!
Finalmente il ritorno alle origini!! Grandiosi!!
Very Good! 😃
🧡💘💜
I like how Anthonys microphone stick is able to disapparate and apparate again in the last shots
PLEASE COME TO BELO HORIZONTE POR FAVOR
Don’t retire!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Anthony CRANKING. I love Flea smiling like he least he is.
They should've quit right after Californication...
so Irish Pirate music is where were at now? no thanks...

Anthony looks like he lost a bet
One of the best bands ever music human beings pure genius
Nothing explains this feeling! PEPPERS FOREVER ♥♥
oh por Dios regresarooooooon
🥇
Wow. Refined simplicity of the genius. Love how they keep it to three instruments and vocals, .....and the connecting half tones. Another masterpiece.
A volta do john
Man I needed this. Fantastic song. I truly missed this sound
New song is nice and all, but to be honest it’s a bit dull around the edges. Let’s see what the rest of the album sounds like.
https://youtu.be/NW55qxXXECs
No se supera  Esto es demasiado ❤️
This is very cool, I remember when starting to learn the guitar I would try do John stuff and couldn't properly, so made my own joke thing sorta making fun of not being able to do it properly, there's one that John does in this that sounds like my failed attempt. That's made me laugh but yeah brilliant new song r.h.c.p 🙂
Top demais que bom não tem som igual como esse 🇧🇷❤️
Gracias por volver Frusciante!
Eddie Guerrero back from the dead
He looks hideous with that hair and moustache
They just cannot make a bad tune can they…. Feeling this cannot wait for the album
Welcome back John ❤❤❤
Kinda reminds me of Cosmo Canyon 🤣
(hear me now) So... Are we really not going to mention how badass are Anthony's dancing moves in this clip? Ok then... (get it on)
INJECT THIS INTO MY VEINS!
Sounds like a Stadium Arcadium track, I'm glad they are going towards that sound, maybe that album is like... Neptune or something? lol
Individually, they are all still wonderful musicians, with maybe the exception of Keidis' writing. But together, this is way to familiar to warrant any real attention. It literally sounds like every RHCP song ever written. Man, I love them when I was a kid.
I loved This... Beatiful
Fruscinate It's from another planet 🎶🤘🏻👽

Ugghh, I wonder if these guys know how many people were murdered and oppressed by VI Lenin.
esta canción es una mezcla de otras canciones, una canción de vibras distintas
I Red Hot senza Frusciante non sono la stessa cosa...bentornato ❤️
This man is getting prettier with age!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
🇷🇸 ❤️ 🌶
Why is Keidis singing in a West Country accent?  This is absolute dreck.
Thank you guys Thank you John
Yep, good stuff A~N
This song sounds to powerful and melancholic Not a huge fan of the band but they're awesome
Ya era hora
plz more
Me encanta, es un sonido crudo, simple, sin demagogia moderna, como una evolución retroactiva. Puro rock, espero con ansias escuchar el disco entero ❤️
Our GOOD TIME BOYS  are back!  ❤️‍🔥
What a shitty song.
Thatz it.
I miss you
🎸♥️♥️♥️♥️
THE SONG AND VIDEO JOHN FLEA ANTHONY CHAD ITS ALL PERFECT THE WORLD WILL JEVER BE THE SAME IN SO HAPPY IT’S INCREDIBLE UNLIMITED LOVE FOR THIS

Boom 🔥
the Legendary RHCP is back, even they NEVER LEFT!!!  ♥
Já ouvi essa música N vezes desde o lançamento e é incrível notar cada detalhe "novo"... o backing-vocal do John, os riffs, a transição entre calma-barulho na música... Enfim, que saudade que estávamos dessa magia toda dos RHCP, que venham mais! 💖🌶️🇧🇷
Epic comeback 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
love you so much RHCP ! <3 Snow hey oh was the reason why i learned with 12 guitar because i want to play it!!!
Larga vida a los red hot!

The melody sounded like "riders on the storm" in the begining
the more i watch the more I love 🤟😍😍
Nunca perde a essência, simplesmente RHCP. ❤️🇧🇷

ANTHONY IS A POETIC GENIUS! THANK YOU FOR TRANSLATING LIFE'S EXPERIENCES THROUGH YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL WORDS AND SONGS!

The classic! Made my day!
A melhor das melhores. Os melhores dos melhores.

Damn the mix is so freakin tight.  The space and air around each instrument is impeccable without one drowning out another...It just sounds incredible.
Это шедевр

That shit you see them spraying in the sky?  That's aluminum, barium, and strontium that they're poisoning you with....idid
Russian propaganda to dumb down the masses.
Vindo aqui várias vezes para comprovar, porque ainda não acredito que tô vivendo a era John Frusciante de volta ao Chili Peppers. ❤️‍🔥
I mean I loved The Getaway but you cant match their sound with Frusciante! so glad he's back! I'm getting serious Stadium Arcadium vibes right now
Muito bom
Fodaaaaa
Wellcome Back BIG brothers! What a pleasure to hear how modern waves have NOT changed you, how youR sound stayes such  same old and native! What a pleasure to see how something doesnt changes! ...it feels like we haven't grown at all either...  RHCP - Love forever. 🇦🇿❤
Ive been listening to RHCP all of my musical life, diving into music when I was in 6th grade fresh out of elementary school. I am about to turn 33 years old and I am just so emotional and nostalgic after hearing this release. For the majority of my life, Ive worshipped RHCP and used songs by them to help whatever situation I was in. Otherside and Californication sucked me in. Slow Cheetah birthed a fingerpicking guitarist in me. I would blare This is the Place in my days of drug addiction. Hard to Concentrate is going to be played at my fiancé and I's wedding. Soul to Squeeze... I have no words. And now Black Summer is like a recap of all of those times rushing back in to me slapping me in the face. I am so excited and thrilled you guys are pumping out new music to the point of being in tears. Thank you for all the music you guys produce, its helped me in life more than you could imagine. See y'all in Atlanta!
The guitar solos is back.
Wow! Keidis is ripped again too!!!!!!!!!!
Essa nova musica Red Hot esta muito bom
esta canción fue regresar a los 2000s QUE GENIAL!!!
🇽🇰🇦🇱🇽🇰🇦🇱🇽🇰🇦🇱
Espero que as próximas tenham aquela suingada mais rítmica, menos melódica, como nos álbuns mais antigos
WOW! Glad to see the boys back together again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's go CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!!! LOVE YOU GUYS!
o pessoal dessa banda não tava morto ou algo assim? Ou tô confundindo?
Justo lo q esperaba!
John, Flea, and Chad are all way too talented to be perpetually shackled to Anthony.
They couldn't have came out with a song at a better time life has been hard and you guys have made it so much easier thank you red hot chili peppers you guys have helped me through my worse
soy tan feliz
J'adore
we love you guys!
don't forget to support RHCP on spotify too!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
gracias por venir a salvar mi año
Glad for the john frusciante guitar parts, i m sure it will overshadow their last two albums..i m not really a pepper fan anymore, but I came here out of curiosity, I m still stuck in the old times..but still this band isn t really the red hot chili peppers anymore..it is too soft and less crazy , close to normal..
Can you redo this with an Anthony Keidis accent? Other than that, this is the Chili Peppers the world has been missing.
The undeniable groove!!!!
Amasing song love it a lot ,,but whats that weird  looks of Anthony Kiedis seriously lolollllllll
GOT TICKETS TO THE MIAMI SHOW LFG!,  84 HARDCORE BORN
John Frusciante is legendary.
John Frusciante’s vocals may be the single most underrated part of RHCP’s signature sound!
Клево выглядишь Энтони!, красава.
This is amazing.  Has anyone noticed the cool vocal style?
😎
john we love you so much …
even someone who doesn’t understand anything about guitar can sense how magnificent this is. john frusciante is incomparable.
Еб.....ть он постарел!теперь с этими усами на Дэнни Трехо похож!
now this puts a smile on my face , just pure greatness these four and man gotta love frusciante ❤️
He's back 🎸
Nice to see you again John :)
Definitely can hear the old school vibe. Pick it up pick it up pick it up.
This song is going to be on my rhcp-on- repeat playlist!
Hallo my idol
Welcome back John!!
Now this, this is how it's done. RHCP always great music.
Красивые
Yes
FRUSCIANTE!!!!
great again, thanks
rhcp are always the best of the best
Æ
I have listened to this vibe for 15 times now on repeat. I don't fckin care if he sounds like a Pirate as some people say.. i'm just chillin' here... and in perpetual bliss that RHCP is still RHCP and still sounds as fresh as ever.
These guys will never stop pushing the envelope.That is why they are the greatest band that my generation brought to be.Love it!!!
Amazing.This is the RHCP I know, with Frusciante and Rick Rubin back they finally sound and feel like themselves again.
About time
Heavy nostalgia. Who remembers driving around and cranking the radio up when Under The Bridge came out? Those were the good music days! Hopefully this song is the first of many that will usher in a new era of great music, we need it!!!
The Guitar Jesus is back!

John Frusciante is the Peppers
Funky fresh new song
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end

ANTHONY ZAPPA
Is Anthony back with Sinead? What’s up with his ☘️ accent.
Red hot chili Peppers 🇧🇷
I'm 99% sure they filmed this in The Volume (the same set where they filmed The Mandalorian). Also, Deborah Chow (one of the directors of Mando and also the director for the upcoming Obi-Wan series) directed this video.
Will Ferrel sending it to drums lol kkkkk
Frusciante Rules
😭
Rip josh
Somehow the music brings back memories..
Standing ovation for Will Ferrell on drums everyone.
John mother fucking Frusciante (to quote flea as Slane castle) is back. This song is awesome.
They are back baby!!
Finalmente!!!! La espera valió la pena 😎🤩

Now.this.is.the.RED.HOT.CHILI.PEPPERS!
To all "fresh listeners". please check their songs quixotic elixer, bunker hill and this velvet glove. thats the level we are normally used to
Si no te gusta la canción está bien, es tu opinión. Pero hace falta insultar?
Um dia sem ouvir RHCP é um dia triste! Melhor banda.
Neves stop my Friends, Neves stop!!! We need you.
Big Stadium Arcadium vibes... I love it
rename the band Frusciante and the chili peppers
Sounds likes he's over pronouncing his r's, kinda distracting.
god's favorite band !!!!
So fucking perfect!!! Miss u sooooo much
Thanks Chili peppers for another beautiful Song! S2
LEGENDS NEVER DIE 🌹
Los voy a amar toda la vida!!!! Gracias por todos estos añoss de musica para mis oídos.
Extrañaba ésa leñadora 🎸🎸

This song makes me wanna do a ton of drugs and just lay down while listening to this
Frusciante is back . That's All what we need 😍  Great song ! ❤️❤️
Yessss!!!
toda de FRUSCIANTE
Frusciante 🧡
Welcome back omm jhon.salam dari belitung
I've been waiting... for this classic vibe.
John Frusciante is back with the Red Hot Chili Peppers??!!? Best news I've heard this year!
Aí meu coração 😍❤️
l’osmose avec frusciante de retour  !j'ai hate
Hahaha Anthony Kiedis looks like an ‘80s HIV patient
Фрушанте в строю! Как же я по человечески рад за него! Самый лучший состав!👍
Peppers steel life🥰🥰🥰
First listen didn't grab me. Listened the next morning and this song is like re-living my youth.
Esses 4 juntos não tem erro🤘
Во деды отожгли!
that's the way I like it
With John, the Red Hot chili peppers always have new flavor, a taste of freedom and a psychedelic distortion reminiscent of the old Jimi. That sound  that ignites softly with Flea's bass.
Good as always ❤
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE     Slowed & reverb
long live, RHCP!!!
John Anthony Motherfucking Frusciante is back!
Ok wow. New favorite rhcp song. Amazing.
Это звучит офигенно, ребят вы самые лучшие.
Finally some good music for 2022 happy to see John back too!
just in time for bush fire season in western australia
Is that Will Farrell on the drums?
La guitarra suena tan John Frusciante
Whats with the Irish pirate accent?
Hey...it's a singing pirate pedo.  And later he takes his shirt off....
Insane 6 years after 🤩
Amazing song
Rhcp are my absolute favorite band.  I'm honestly not happy with this Irish accent thing going on
JOHN????
I don't know why, but the song feels like it's 10 years old and I love it!
Jonh❤️
Here before the music analyst come
Already a classic
OMG!! I LOVE IT!! ESPEREI TANTO TEMPO POR ESSE MOMENTO... CRY 🤩🤩
"Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Everything ok with the song, but who the fuck directed the video? boringgggg
Oh man. That guitar. It's good to have you back, Frusciante.
¿Por qué está canción no tiene tantas reproducciones? Frusciante está de vuelta, ¿no lo están entendiendo?
Hit us with one more album dudes. Who but rhcp.  Respect
the intro with fleas bass, johns incredible solo and everything else about this song, it gives me such chills thank god these guy are back making our days better
Es bueno tenerlos de vuelta, genios!! 🤘🏻🎶
The vibe is a fusion of "By The Way" and "Stadium Arcadium" albums  - couldnt be better! 😍
O comentário brasileiro que vc tá procurando. 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷✌🏼
Mantap kawan
John entrando e tendo o seu tempo no começo foi de arrepiar. Que momento perfeito para estar vivo e vendo história sendo feita.
Sounds like neil young alittle
RHCP has outdone themselves. Damn!
日本に来てくんねぇかな
I didn't expect it to sound too good What a good song
Welcome back John🙏🏻.
Road Trippin'!
Glad to see John Wick is back on guitar.
Pretty average song, very cool Frusciante solo though
legendary, vai frusciante carrega o album kk
This band will continue to rock just like all the greats
aw my fave grandpas are back
Welcome back boys! This the band I know and have loved for all these decades they've been performing! When John Frusciante is in, the band is and sounds complete! This song is a blessing on dark days! 🤘🤟🤘🤟👏
What a vibes  📉📉📉📉
Crazy, really amazing RHCP
I prefer black pepper to a black summer but this works anyway.
Kiedis is the oldest young-look person I've ever knew
Best song ever and forever
Ah maaan JOHN IS BACK BABY
Просто шикарно!
I missed Frusciante sooo much
🔥🔥🔥 Sensacional
John Anderson Seminole Wind ?
Is Anthony morphing into Iggy Pop now? LOL
Joe exotic much ? :L
Los adoro, qué maravilla, y cómo gana la canción con las sucesivas escuchas. It'll grow on you, this song!!
Wooow 😍
Red Hot Chili Peppers - Black Summer Lyrics    A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)     Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  Chorus It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end    Crack the flaming whip A-sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Chorus Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end    I've been waiting, I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I've been waiting, I've been waiting Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waiting, I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
I've been waiting, I've been waiting!!
LOVE YOU ALL
This has stadium vibes all over it 🙌
John is back.. Great song from the group
Do you think Anthony watched Tiger King and thought “that’s the hair for me…”
Still listening to this classic in 2022!!??

Нужен Рик Рубин...драйва нет(
I've been waiting for this for YEARS
Agora sim estou escutando rifes de guitarra novamente na música da banda. Pq com Josh não tinha, só dava pra perceber o baixo do flea.  Jhon toca muito. RHCP i love you...
eddie guerrero
JOHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN IS BACK

Always loved the Hendrix influence in Frusciante
Slow Cheetah vibes.  I liked it. :D

https://youtu.be/TF_PsAuXYmI
I feel a good vibe on this new album. Long live JF and AK!!
Absolutely!
I almost forgot about RHCP, didn't even know John was back. And now I'm really happy to see him in this video. I don't remember the last time I was so glad because of music.
Beautiful !!
Sonido clásico rock 90'o. Al puro estilo de los RHCP originales, la mejor banda de U.S.A. Increíble canción para su regreso. De ahora en adelante no sé separen JAMÁS!!!
Ameeeei ❤
Not their best.
Eu sei que vc ja ouviu pelo menos 15 vezes, ta de boas. Hahahah que som!!!!
Eddie Guerrero is still alive.
I can't wait to dance
The mullet is back
Thank you RHCP
Hell yeah🤘
At 45 years of life there is one thing I can always count on, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers will always be the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
Good song… to me the vocal is a little meh, doesn’t quite have that melodic focus and potency their other singles do.  It’s no Scar Tissue let’s put it that way, but it’s still very good.
boaaa ♥
My favorite band is back! So good this song! A new classic is born, this is real music.
that voice...
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!
Meh at best. Lyrically this is horrible. Do better boys.
Rhed hot sempre speciali...♥️😘
I didn’t know Keanu Reeves was in a band • • • • (Missed you John 🖤)
John com sua essência do rhcp 🚀
Ohhh mrd que puta emoción se viene el álbum... que nunca muera red hott
I love RHCP since I was in the middle school… 20 and more years later and the emotions they make me feel are the same. Thanks to them I’m free.
Yesssssssssssss
John! finally
Este si es el estilo de RCHP 🤘🏻
Muito boa cara!!!!
bereh bung 🔥🔥
The return of Frusciante! I’ve missed this so much.
Man this whole thing just feels like a real beautiful return to form for all their fans, young and old 🥺
Is this Jethro Tull?
will Farrell still rocking those drums
el mejor regalo de cumpleaños,MAQUINAS
Simplesmente demais, ouvir o som do HRCP é um complexo de emoções!! Curto demais
I wish my grandfather danced like this Peppers
i want to note a superb visual effects by Sergii Mashevskyi & co, very great job guys
atrakebt  <3
Господи как вы круты)
"We're getting the band back together"
Tony Stark & Co after stealing the Soul Stone and passing by a very contemporary hairdresser.
The pepper got hot again.
Que linda!!! Amo demais RHCP ❤
John Frusciante fez a gente ouvir o som da guitarra novamente após 10 anos.
If Flea isn't in your list of greatest bassists, your lying to yourself
Somzêra!
red hot, nunca decepciona👏👏
Welcome back mr.peppers!! And Frusciante too!
John just woke up and said iam ready again
I love you guys!!! I can’t wait for September!!! I’ll see you guys in Orlando!
Gets better every listen 🤘🏿🎸🥁🎤🎶🎵
Esses 4 junto são perfeitos 😍😍😍
WTF are you guys taking us?
Finally I'm so happy
Nice guitar touch, otherwise too predictable, boring.
Will Ferrell on drums everyone!
Great to see Will Ferrell still on the drums
Top!!! Muito bom!!!
😍😍 thanks to the Lord of Rock!!! #RockoutMotherfuckers !
Perfeição 🤩🤩🤩 meu coração não aguenta 🤩🤩🤩
Can we get Heemie Leemie on the album??... See you in Aug in Mooseland ! Much love
I fux wit it
I thought that they wont never come back but thats not true haha love them
The legendary RHCP are back!
New tune. New haircut 🦱✂️
😍🌶️🤘🏻
I grew up with you every stage of my life guys... LOVE YOU!
John Frusciante returns and Anthony has his Blood Sugar Sex Magik back! I liked Josh a lot by Getaway, but RHCP isn't really the same without John and I'm so happy, and I can't wait to see them live again, bring it on lads! I just hope that this is it and John doesn't quit again
FLEA THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What an acid trip…..psychedelic and beautiful…..god bless those 4 … 42 years creating beautiful music and feeding souls with joy. Amazing guitar by Frusciante, Anthony looks great, I loved that hippiesh style by flea. 🎸☄️
Good tune. Now when Frusciante is back they sound like the real RHCP again. This track could have been included on Californication.
OMG!
Glad Frustiante is back.
Good,good,good....
Red hot is back on track!!!👏👏👏👏🔥
BBM Brought me here!
Love the caterpillar mustache Anthony has 😂
una sensacion unica al ver a john en la guitarra
Chilli pepper
Incrível
Instant classic! Thanks!! 😎
The best thing happened to rock in these days. Thank you guy's.
Me encanto, me recuerda a slow cheetah
Que tempo bom para se estar vivo, Frusciante de volta ao RHCP é nostálgico pkrl
Супер! Нестареющие и бомбические перцы!))) А с гитарой Джона они наиболее сочные! Здорово что этот состав снова вместе) Заглянули бы ещё к нам...
🌶🤘
Hell yeaaaaaaaaah❤️❤️❤️
Kinda like sar tissue
Meh...
Remember when bands used to sound like real people playing actual instruments with soulful abandon? I’ve missed this feeling. Nice job guys, & welcome back Mr. Frusciante 👍🏻
This has made me so happy
Can't explain how happy I am to see the guys in action again. This song is just pure bliss 😍
Just when you thought the Peppers couldn't possibly get any better, they reach a new level! This song has that raw RHCP essence again that was sadly missing in John Frusciante's absence (not that Josh wasn't a good guitarist in his own right, but y'all know what I mean). Super stoked for the album now!
Good old RHCP! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ Perfect!!
gj
Anthony Kiedis needs re looking
In the first time i didnt get it..  but after 1000x listen times im little bit closer
Continuan com esa misma energia desde sus comienzos 🤯
AAAAAAAAAAA MEUS DEUS❤️🌶️
Viva la Frusciante
Estilo único 🤗
Wow!..  Kiedis has a  Frank Zappa style in his look.
#RedHotForever
STILL HOT!!!!
Always amazing Song!  Get on top! Thank you RHCP!!!!!!!   PS - Hey Russia and China I hate your war! Fuck off!
Finalmente sono tornati"Fantastici" Red Hot Chili Peppers... Mamma mia che Bomba👍👍☮️☮️💛💛🎸🎸🎶🎶Fenomenali
Siempre los mejores solo éxitos excelente los amoooooo ❤️❤️❤️
Rhcp sendo rhcp. Iggy pop nós vocais? Kkkkkk
💝🙌 Рады возвращению Фрушанте крепкой дружбы и любви, успеха
Love the 🌶s! We definitely needed this.
Que maravilha ver vocês juntos de novo 😻👏👏👏. Que venha muita coisa boa por aí! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Best song they’ve done in years
My mother used to love the singer from RHCP , but she says he looks like a mass murderer now with the tash and short hair lol!
😍😍😍🖤
I don't like the anti-harmonic sounds of RHCP, which start here at 1:30. They have this in most of their songs. It could have been really good music but these mainstream sounds always destroy it. I guess they chose money over good music, that's the way it goes..
Its nice to see classics from our youth realize we want to hear them still.
It really reminds of Ride On by Christy Moore  https://youtu.be/5wnEVoyukU4
They'll never make another BSSM or Stadium Arcadium, but no on expects that of them. Their best days are behind them. But it's just great to see them back together enjoying themselves and making music. But this does have massive Stadium Arcadium feels to it
pls add subs eng!
когда Дима Билан успел стать солистом в РедХодЧилПеп???? ;D
Ngl i was bored af before 1:35, but then here we go! Good to see you dudes together! 💪
Gracias chicos, de verdad. Desde el fondo de mi corazón, gracias por estar aún haciendo lo que tanto les gusta y por compartir para que seamos felices again and again. ❤️
First RHCP's song i heard in rock n roll condition of me. Very excited
Bien p9rbque vuelven. Pero el tema no le vi nada. Solo darle más participación a frusciante que vuelve.
God bless u  I need your 5 seconds thanks
This is the most RHCP song ever wrote
Os cara são atemporal
Bentornati!!!
❤️
geniosssssss!!! los amo! no paren nunca!!!
the tone of the fru's guitar. i am drooling. it's so good. the whole track is drooling goodness.
Très bonne musique comme d’habitude vivement le stade de France 👍💪🇫🇷
This song is very soothing like the "zephyar song". To me, it has the same riff as "Your Decision by Alice in Chains". I wouldn't put them in the category. I love to see them in possibly concert one day and see flee go crazy at bass. Scratch that on my bucket list.
🇷🇺💙
meu deus são os patrões 🙌🏼😭 tá perfeito pqp
THEY'RE BACK THANK GOD !!!!!!! THANK GOD THANK GOD THANK GOD
What's with the accent, Anthony? Lol
Black Summer !!! RHCP  Great song and beautiful video , welcome back @johnfrusciante  I’ve been waiting for 🇧🇷 Brazil Tour !!!  Long life Chilli Peppers 🌶🌶
Sounds kind of like Slow Cheetah in the chorus, interesting.
zaqrwisty kawałek
Frusciante is back. Its a great song. Reminds me of a song from thier album Californication. Its so soothing. I love it.
stings kieu a !!!
I didn't know how much I missed them. Music became shit in the last years, RHCP giving me hope.
i like the correlation of fuck the establishment and its mask and vaccine mandates used to control and supress
THIS SONG Sounds in MY MIND. 💓💓💓💓
УРА!!!! Мир оживает, настоящая музыка возвращается!
Whoah, this is getting worse & worse the more i hear it. Anthony please stop pronouncing your words in that weird way & how about you FINALLY shave off that ridiculous moustache????
🖤
John frusciante is killin it
Спасибо!  Это было прекрасно!
господи это мои любимые деды
wOW! Frusciante sigue teniendo ese PUNCH! 😍
solo trash? Am i crazy or did john phone it in??
Awesome song!  Also, sorry, but it'll never get old: Will Ferrell in the drums is something else!
Is this the new Joe Exotic upload?
Very nice song. I listen again and again
I miss Josh😂😋
Сразу лайк! Огонь композиция!
It's really bad what happened :| What's with the country singing. Lyrics don't flow. Eh. You would think someone would say something before releasing it. Hope you guys are doing ok! Bring the producer of the last album back.
I gotta say there's something magical about seeing the four of them all jamming out together in that last shot. Good tune, looking forward to the album.
Thank you for your return Keanu Reeves
Glad to see Will Ferrell is back with the band!
So good to hear good new stuff from RHCP. South Australia (where I am), like California, are going to have epic Climate Change induced Black Summers.
*CLASSIC RIFFS BACK AGAIN, enuff of the wish and ebay guitarists for this band 🤣 BACK TO THE ORIGINAL*
Another absolute banger, can't wait to see you guys live in Manchester
This song is amazing.  It warms my heart to see John back with them.
red hot chilli tatos
いいね！
Another hit.  💯  This is so RHCP.
JOHN!!!
Glad to see John again!!!
Welcome back john ❤️ 🎸
Тишина
my love my life
Dream Californication in a Black Summer
Вот вроде знаешь все, но когда в видео появился Джон, что-то потеплело прям в душе, и так и застыла с глупой улыбкой сидеть. Не ожидала от себя)
Спасибо ребята!
Thank you universe for sending this incredible sound to channel through the chili peppers so we can enjoy it here on earth 😍🥳💜❤
LEGENDS ARE BACK!!!!
Iconic 🙌🏽♥️
UMMM...... FRUSCIANTE  TOP
,,Riding on the headless horse". I've heard: ,,Riding on the Hitler's horse". And I was like: WTF?!
"The Getaway" was'nt a bad album, but it was really different - chill but not rough. The production was more pop than rock. It's more natural again and less simplified. That new song gives me "Stadium Arcadium"-vibes and i dig it!
RHCHP no decepciona!!! Grandes Mijos!!
John is back 🤤🤤 O som da guitarra dele é inconfundível pqp🇧🇷
Long live the peppers!!!!  Chili head for life!!!!!
I heard this song only 1 time : 😬 it's not a masterpiece imo . Hope the lp is gonna be betta .
Lagu ini benar-benar mengembalikan memori di saat aku pertama kali mendengar lagu otherside dan mulai sangat menyukai RHCP. Please come to Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
WoW!!! Amazing!!! Perfect!!! RHCP Love Forever!!!
I can't stop listening to this song. Oh my gosh, wtf is this masterpiece?
Черное лето - это когда я наш сарай с углем случайно поджег.
아 미친
Хорошо, очень хорошо, спасибо.
Que nostalgia boa ouvir novamente essa voz, esses arranjos, tudo é do RHCP incomparável 🇧🇷🇧🇷
And they're back....
The song RHCP fans needed!! Beauty.
Just pre ordered the new album on vinyl, feeling good
Make more make more make more!!!!!
You can tell John’s back
Hellz yeah!! All the way!
Who else cried during the solo?
This give me chills and tears. They are back!!! Thank God!!! Love u Guys
Konačno!
Josh Klinghoffer smiled and liked this Long Life to RHCP
Muito bom vê-los juntos novamente!!! Muito bom mesmo!! Vocês são fodas demaaaaais
bue bom c*ralho
I didn’t know chuck norris was the lead singer
RHCP 4EVER 🔥🔥🔥
Jest dobrze, ale nie ma tego pokładu emocji do jakiego przyzwyczaili mnie na swoich najlepszych płytach.
solo una parola ........................... TOP!!!!!!!
Que vibe massa, energia boa demais, vida longa ao RHCP \o/
待ってました！🌶
Peppers put some of that truth in the music
пожалуй установлен новый рекорд по соотношению комментарии/просмотры!  perhaps set a new record for the ratio of comments / views!
just LOVE it...
QUÉ EMOCIÓN!!PEDAZO DE TEMA😍ESTOY IMPACIENTE PORQUE LLEGUE EL DÍA DEL CONCIERTO🌶🤩♥️
Thanks guys, very cool
Как я долго ждал от них этого звучания. Джон, не уходи больше
john wick on guitar! lols
Can we all appreciate how great they all still look! Kiedis is 59 👀
Чёт не зашло
Super happy for this.
Lord frusciante is back.we missed you!!!
I'm glad it's a full album
Escuchando esto da la sensación que Frusciante nunca se fue, que estaba ahí de alguna manera..
Anthony Kiedis, somewhere between jedi and belter 😂😂😂
Vasco da gama, o maior time da história
It's clear how inspired of the look down it was and the political effect it's had on everyone  Love it
FUCK YEAH!
What was Anthony’s favourite subject at school?   Aaaarrrrrrttttt!  #piratejokes
John Frusciante!!!!!!!
Nice song, waiting for the album 👍🤘👏
Fuck yes 2022 loves you 🥁🤘🥁🤘
2:50 🔥🔥🔥
Gods
🤟🤟🤟🍺🍺🍺
Solo espero que haya sido una estrategia haber puesto un tema tan común como corte de su nuevo disco para luego sorprender con su magia .gracias .esperando
Best band in the world
https://youtu.be/8c_yLhKebqM
Love the fact Chill peppers are still smashing it! Since I was 10 I've loved them!
I like how in the first few seconds you can instantly recognize Frusciante's unique style. Amazing!!!
Frusciante's Guitar... the best part...good song... but not more than that
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 slk sou bastante fã de rhcp e eu tô muito feliz que eles estão voltando mano
Anyone else feel at ease and content whilst listening to any piece of music they've ever done?
Classic RHCP - welcome back guys 🏄🏻‍♂️🎸🎤
You are at your best with John's guitar! Can't wait for the new album.
🔥
aaaaaaaaaah

John Fuzz-iante
🖤
Jesus commes    and this is how He looks like in your heart: Revelation 1 13 like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, 15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. 16 In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.  ( each time you look on Him and give Him a bigger size as universes as He is much bigger than all created things it gets hotter because of more light.) He forgave us 2000 years ago even future sins.( Israel had a goat to free for 1 year future sins so how much more worth is the blood of God.).   Muslems, Jews and Christians awaits Jesus( no one awaits Paul or Muhammad to comme from heaven for us)  In the begginning was the Word and it is the true God.( without the word was nothing made.. word like by computer. God gave earth to humans and humans gave earth to devil so God became flesh to redeem humanity while dying on cross and ressurrecting on third day as a firstfruit so we can becomme like Him God in flesh. (because of this we count time BC (before Christ) and AC (after Christ)  or AD which is same  .: (under important playlist you find good teachings of others on my channel). Blessings dears and head up. ( God chose to not remember sins as far East is from WEST!! His armor is: His salvaion, His righteousness, His truth, His peace, His faith, His (s)word (ya take also His oil, waters, blood , winds, fire, crowns, light etc.  2Kor 3,18 And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
Ohh my love 😍
OMG🔥🔥🔥🔥
👍👏👍👏👍
Rhcp with john is a beauty
I Love the new song 🎵
この音を何年待っていたことか！ おかえりRed Hot Chili Peppers！ おかえりジョン・フルシアンテ！ 涙が止まらない！！
Love Anthony's pronounciation in this song. Very playful.
Chills and memories .
I’ve been waiting for this!
love for rhcp ❤️  fans from Indonesia 🇮🇩

Oh         My         Gosh 😅
Wah..
O coração chega erra as batidas❤
Classic Chad's snare ❤️
When did Joe Exotic join the band?
I'm sad about what happened with Josh. but, John will always have a special place in rhcp. And their music is very distinct with John. I miss this sound.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
John is God
Oh Anthony....my heart! You've still got it! 😍
AMAZING SONG! Glad the peppers are BACK!
Welcome back fellas ❤️
No wonder they became world-famous so quickly... Have I told you, how I love Frusciante's absurd chords?! By the way...
Yes the old pepper sound is back
Frusciante is back big time
Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
УРААААААААААААААА!
Love you johnnnn ❤️❤️
Frusciante guitar notes touch the heart so deeply!
Excelente!!! Larga vida #rhcp
Is there an instrumental version of this anywhere
Não podia ser melhor.
John é uma lenda
These guys are HUGE!
Quelle magie d'entendre le son des Chili Peppers, une fois de plus ils nous frappent en plein cœur 💖 Oui c'est ça l'amour, Unlimited Love, bravo les gars et merci de nous faire vivre ces émotions, depuis 27 ans pour ma part 🥰
Estou em paz novamente ❤
Oh it's so good😍, welcome back ❤️
Is it only me or do you also see Frusciante & John Wick on the guitar?
Omg John "FUZZ"ciante !!!!
Added to RHCP list
Amazing sound as usual. John is back and they needed that and the results are just WOW
I went to one of their concerts and I have to say it has to be the top concert i've been to so far in my life.
This has a 'Otherside' vibe. Love it 🤘
LEGENDARY
Привет из России ♥️
What factor is he wearing?
On attend la vidéo avec Mc Fly et Carlito
I am a RHCP fan, but I'm not feeling this song.
Where's Josh?
John Wick is playing so good on the guitar. I’m glad that he joined the Band!
0:44-0:55 John's flanger?
Super👏
Damn I shed a tear when I saw John ... love you guys :)
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾‼️‼️‼️
Is that Will Ferrell?
JOHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Это прекрасно!
Unlike their first comeback with Californication, this one doesn't sound good
Wow it sounds like RHCP
Thanks for amazing music. From Russia with love, guys.
Frulicious!!!!
I havent seen the band in years and its quite awsome that they still produce good songs

john is back!
when anthony said; "it's been a long time since i made a new friend" i really felt that
Ждём 🇺🇦
JF is king. Fuzzin the hell out.
Honestly, there’s nothing special to Chad’s playing. He’s playing the same thing that he’s been playing for the last 25 years. I like this song and this new cycle for the Peppers, but in a way, it feels like this song makes the Pepper’s strengths and weaknesses both very apparent. Frusciante and Flea definitely carry this song. Frusciante brought his classic tone and beautiful playing style back to the band, along with those great backing vocals. Chad’s drum phrasing is very generic and boring. Not very creative from a drumming standpoint. Anthony sounds great in the chorus of this tune, but man, whatever he’s doing in the beginning of this song just doesn’t really sound right. I don’t know. That’s just my take. Mostly just bored of Chad’s complacency.
Sounds like crap
Keeanu in the guitar
Anyone else that some how recignize the intro from a B-side song? I cant remeber wich tho? Anyone who remember? Its very similar if not the same.
Wow this song slaps! Fucking excellent! Glad to have some new music from the band!
Suka lagu² rhcp siapapun gitarisnya. Seneng banget akhirnya mereka bikin album baru dengan john lagi.. Udah aki² tapi masih energik! Hebat!
the Best Ever
Bentornato John!
Yessssss RHCP ARE BACK !!! MISS THEM !!! PLEASE CONCERT IN JAKARTA INDONESIA
It's been years and I'm so excited they are all back together although much love to Josh!! What a fantastic artist!! But I couldnt of asked for a better start to the album we have waited over a decade for 😭😭
pretty cool stuff man
Te amo Frusciante
The way that last chorus drops and they all come together…
From Beyond, Jimi Hendrix is looking down at his greatest pupil and smiling. He says: "Welcome back John. You've been missed."  A great song. The RHCP is back with a vengeance.
RHCP RIP 1983-1997
Josh is a great guitar player, but nothing compares to Red Hot with john
Why do I feel like Black Summer is referring to a Heroin filled summer?
Siempre habéis estado cuando os he necesitado, y justo cuando más os necesitaba volvéis sacando esta maravilla. Doy gracias a la música que cura el alma. Gracias, Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Incroyable!!! Je suis content de voir le super retour du super guitariste. Vous êtes tous Incroyable!!!!. Hâte de voir la suite.
Another one!!!please!!!
Love it! I want to hear the rest of the album. Also like many people say in the comments thank God they always stay in their own style, not caring about earning more money or reaching to the youngest generations or whatever. 💓
Opening riff... f@#$ John, great to have you back! (Also in love with AK annunciation of dark sude of themoon! Ha)
Hmm, singing with an irish accent and doesnt chad ever get fed up of playing that same beat ? Theyre such talented musicians but seem to be too formulaic now.
Всё необычайное и обожаемое. Всё ,как мы любим.  Фли сверкает зубом и дурачится. Чад сосредоточен на процессе. Джон погружён в неизведанные миры. А Энтони .. Настоящий и любимый.
Magic Rock.. W Red Hot . Thank you.
amazing
GRANDI GRANDI GRANDISSIMI!!! <3
Дима Билан так постарел но поёт всё ещё хорошо 😂 А Киану Ривз? Отлично шпарит на гитаре 😂
Waaaoww... thanks
WTF???
Where can I get a 10 h version of the first 8 seconds??? 🌶️
Anthony Kiedis: staying in shape so we don't have to
let's just be honest guys... it's not that good
Wow great song!!! Love you guys 💃🕺🤓🧸😎
Yes my baby. Yes!
Will Ferrell still looks good.
The band that has always had that ability to evolve and make completely different music but still retain that hard to define essence and signature sound. Like a man coming home from the wilderness in his flannel shirt maestro Frusciante humbly brings back his beautiful guitar wizardry, virtuosity and creativity into the fold joining a reinvigorated reborn Kiedis, an ecstatic hyperactive and energised Flea, and ship steadying beat chucking Chad bringing a good dose of momentous drive and gelling agent. It's like a family outing here. 0.45 has a Hendrix esque guitar element but is classic Frusciante through and through. An emotive maturity is evident in the structure and sound here and I like this heartfelt upbeat some would say pop-rock number and it's timely relevant kind of feel and lyrics. The existential cries of "It's been a long time since I made a new friend, waiting for another Black Summer to end" evidently nods towards the inner turmoil of pandemic frustrations and a yearning for life as it was,  and cobbled together word play around '"Greta'" seems to unfurl a climate consciousness. This being the first single, the psychedelic video and the sound is a conceivable marriage between the By the Way playbook and the ghostly sonic crawls of the Californication era. The experiment of other past lineups has never been able to recreate and capture the Chili's at their transcending, supersonic, original, untouchable and upper bar level sounding best.
Наконец то John Frusciante 😍😍😍  Его бэк вокал это лучше в этом трэке, к сожалению. Будем ждать следующие ⭐️
Danny Trejo has an excellent plastic surgeon. Great to hear the chili's back with John.
como en los viejos tiempos!! Gracias por volver John
Fuck yeah!!! The Band is back 🔥🔥🔥 You guys Rock 🤘🤘😎
John <3
A ver si superan a THE GETAWAY, q sonaba de lujo... Buen rollo esta gente, que alegria q saquen ya un album
Me conmovió muchísimo el saber que ya había salido esta canción y aún más al ahora poder oírla, amo completamente a los Red Hot Chili Peppers, me han acompañado desde los 10 años, en tantos momentos de mi vida y siempre siento frescura en sus canciones, es increíble 🤩
🔥🔥🔥
Nope.
Weak.   Sounds brutal -  Was a Chilli fan ...they lost me here -
Multiple view is mandatory
heartwearming to see u guys get old with passion still lit
No
Nostalgia speaks, John that, John that! But it is true that for a launch 🚀, for example; the atmosphere of Dark Necessities, is far superior.
Anjaay, best lah pokonya 🔥🔥
The song was so good. The drumming phenomenal!
Red Hospice Chili Peppers.
Never fails to amaze
HE IS THE GREATEST FUNK ROCK GUITARIST IN THE WORLD.
I still can’t believe that John playing guitar in the band．now I feel like back 20years old guy who used to listen to RHCPs album everyday!!!
I MISS SEEING JOHN FRUSCIANTE IN THE BAND.
Looks like they're back!
Oh man sound of that fuzz pedal in the solo 😍😍
Lyrics:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
It really sucks!!!!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
I dunno... this feels a lot like it's gonna be the only worthwhile song on the album, and... it's not that great. It's as though an AI algorithm wrote the song based upon parameters from the last couple of good albums.  Aside from John's amazing timeless guitar playing and Flea's legendary bass sound... strip it all down, and it's perhaps on the higher end of mediocrity. I'd be amazed if Sum-41 wrote this song, I guess. It would be a solid Silverchair single.  RHCP just have too much of a legendary back-catalogue to compete with, and since they are pushing 60, it's almost silly for them to be trying to continually capture that same lightning in a bottle.  Rock stars past their prime have a hard time striking a balance between honoring the original spirit which made them great and assimilating with the fact that they are no longer those same young guys anymore.  RHCP have actually done an almost unparalleled job at doing that, but this song feels just a slight bit weak and derivative. The heartbreaking first fumble of an aged loved one. I can't blame them. Whatever side of the fence you fall on, these past two years have just slaughtered everyone's spirit and aged us by decades, and it's kind of hard to get psyched up about things from the before-time. It's saddening, and feels almost pathetic to try and do so.  So... there really will be no "return to normal" because whatever "normal" was, it's now like we're visiting it in hospice and it's just a fading shell.  That's what this song reminds me of. Hospice. Red Hospice Chili Peppers.
What a tune!
Once you see him as John bernthal you can't unsee it
❣️back in the U.S.S.R You don't know how luck you are boys Back in the U.S.S.R
Anthony Kiedis is going to be 60 in November. He is in better shape then most people half his age.
So good to hear Fruciantes guitar sing again
Джон вновь в строю. Его энергетика неисчерпаемая . Будь,бро, внутри RHCP! Не исчезай!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I didn't get excited when I first hear that JF will come back to the band. I was sad because Josh was gone. He offered a fresh sound for RHCP. As soon as I heard JF is back I knew they were going to release something that sounds like the Californication album. This single sounds like an outtake from Californication. Even the drum sound is similar to the Californication album. As an RHCP I find the new single boring and I am feeling like the album will be boring too.
Танцы с голым торсом в шестьдесят — RHCP
This makes me so happy!!!!
YES YES YES!
New single OH YEAAAAH!
I love guys
Oh shit John's got his classic guitar!
I love it
Under  the bridge since
I think Josh gave freshness & more healthy creativity for this super group in their last album 🙌🤟🙌. But Jon brings memory ❤️... I prefer Josh.
Amazing 😍✨
Finally good music again ❤
Хороши старички... Похожи на перцев))
Gotta love the peppers! Keeping music alive 🤟🏻
Yea I talk too much
They should of snuck will ferrall in, just for one quick shot of the drummer
개좋다...🤟
👍👍👍👍
Not a fan of them, but I thought that was pretty good.  Lovely tone all round. My ears liked it. :)
Yeah, this is the new chilli pepper. Alternative rock, chill, funky riff, great solo
Anthony STILL doesn't have a shirt on.   IF I looked half as good as he does I wouldn't wear a shirt either.
This is probably the their last album. I want that is good. This song is very great
10 years I've been waiting for John Frusciante to return.
Ленин на гитаре. Коммунисты?
Antony looks like he is 35 , I should go to the gym right away) and the guitar touches my soul as it did 20 years ago.
JIMI HENDRIX
Wow....Anthony still energetic...
One of my favorite songs by RHCP is 'Show Me Your Soul' from 1990. That was 32 years ago with THIS SAME LINE-UP and Frusciante was only 18! This band is a POWERHOUSE!! Cant wait for the new album!!!!!!
I can't believe Kiedis is almost SIXTY!!!!!
Tune!!!! Johns back!!!
Rick Rubin is back. YEAH
This made me smile! SO HAPPY TO SEE FRUSCIANTE BACK IN WHERE HE BELONGS TO (and no one else - although Dave Navarro was good 1993-1998)! Keep it up peppers! 🙏
3 milhoes e pouco visualizaçao,260 e poucos mil likes? Acho pouco like perto do tanto de visualizaçao
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK
not very good. secondarily
It's good to see and hear Mr. Frusciante do his thing 🎸🎶 As far as the song, it's just okay.
they're finally back, John is back, the Peppers are back let's go rock out
Ура! Дождались!
This sounds like we should all be in a tavern drinking and singing before our next great adventure
The only one amazing band who wrote ‘’wet sand’’ is back! John is back!
Ай хорошо! Мы ждали. Добрый привкус конца 60-х, со всеми психодлеическими и гаражными группами. По By the wayному.
Always been a longtime fan, just wondering about the accents in the beginning of the song?
Jesus Christus is coming soon guys open your eyes he's loving you so much change u mind and oben u heart he will safe u soul for more read the Bible and you will see its the truth in there!
Wenn du Jesus noch nicht kennst, dann öffne dein Herz noch heute
❤
This is dope! Is Anthony Kiedis singing like a pirate in the verses?
Que bueno que estás leyendas siguen haciendo música 💙
Brasil ama vcs red hot chili peppers ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
<333333
It's good, but it's not Dani California level of amazingness.
Dressing gown                 sea shanty's
NO
Guitar solo is lit 🔥
Wonderful song and they're my favourites since the 90s, I was hoping for a new album since so long after the horrible Gateaway... but where is Josh? Ok now Frusciante is back (for the second time). Frusciante was my guitar myth when I was a kid. He plays better for the RHCP, ok (not better than Navarro anyway: I'm the only one to think ONE HOT MINUTE is their top, I know). But... a man can do whatever he wants, come and go, and they say to the other one: "Ok Josh, now f u we don't need you anymore? Go to Pearl Jam". I find that so cruel. So anti-human. So Frusciante.
Waiting on hearing your great live solos in this great song on live concert,  John. Please come to Georgia! We are waiting!
I adore Josh, but man, Frusciante is back…
The bar is pretty high thanks to these guys right there. Thank you for still making music!
待ってました！ レッチリ最高！ みんなカッコいい！
Hey, chicos de Red Hot Chili Peppers. Podrían eliminar el video de Charlie? Se escucha muy mal, como tildado. Eliminenlo y vuelvan a subirlo. Bueno, nada eso. Muchas Gracias y sigan así!
Kiedas paying homage to Joe exotic
Always loved John’s sound. Put your best noise canceling head phones on, get comfy and go for a Chili Peppers ride. Awesome tune and can’t wait to experience the rest of the album so I can trip through the cosmos.
Definitivamente el estilo de Frusciante da un toque de calidad a la banda.
Лучшие! Были и остаются! Перцы 🤩😍 🌶 с любовью из России 🇷🇺 Ждём концерты  🙏🏼
¡Larga vida Frusciante, larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, impresionante sonido y energía que transmiten, bien hecho!
Oh my! John MF Frusciante makes the band. One of my biggest influences <3
I think after all these years, Anthony has finally lost it. The moustache and hairdo is appalling.
Wala pa ring kupas ang RHCP. Mabuhay! 🇵🇭

Fuckin’ love it 🤘🏾
So much respect for these guys 🙏
さいこーーーー！！！！！（動きに毎回笑う）
References to the Australian bushfires of their summer in 2019/2020? Which I think is around when this song was written according the the NME article  It was called coined our 'black summer' by the media and a hideous amount of wildlife died, Kiedis mentions Platypus and Roos
Nice! Pleeeease come to Florence this summer.. 💙🎸🤘🏿🤟🏻
Bellissimo brano❣
Chad Smith and Will Farrell basically interchangable at this point, had to stop the video and go back to make sure they were putting Will in for laffs lol
#Hallelujah  revivió mi #DiegoVerdaguer  🕊
They’re back and pre order just gone in. Bring it on! Album of the Summer.
牛逼
Keren!
Oh yes memories thanks guys 💯💯 great song
Así que volvió el loco.. grandeeee
Это лучшее за последние 15 лет. Возвращаются к старому стилю!
The fact that they kept their identity and the same vibe ❤️ I love you peppers 🌶🌶🌶🌶 !!!!!!
色褪せないね～、レッチリは！ にしても、アンソニーの体型、50才過ぎたオッサンの体つきじゃないわ！ カッケェ～🐵
Il ritorno dei migliori! I love you!!! 🤩💪🏻🌶️

I'm happy to say RHCP has still got it!
He's morphing into Iggy Pop  Peace from Ireland ✌🏼💚🇮🇪
Sabes cuantas millones de visitas son desperdiciadas con puras mierdas y no obras de arte como lo es esta magnifica banda!. En fin, no importa los millones, no importa el dinero, no importa los años que pasen, no hace falta discutir con canciones puras basuras, sabiendo que hay obras de arte como esta banda. Red Hot Chilli Peppers Forever!!
That sound of 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸!!!legend!!
Anthony maintains his figure so that he can keep his shirt off even in his 50s
A little light in the dark 🌈
💜🔥⚔️🤗
Thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers for giving us some great music just like you always have.
After so many years and dark necessities, I have another fav+ one! We missed you forever John! We are glad that you're back
A pesar de todo ustedes siempre seguiran siendo y siguen siendo leyendas, a pesar que pase miles de millones de años, su musica siempre estara en mi corazon y en el de todos, gracias Red Hot Chilli Peppers por hacer mi infancia y darme la mejor musica que un chico como yo pudo haber tenido. Las leyendas nunca muere! Viva el Rock N Roll!

WoW! This song is solid! It's like they just picked up and continued where they left off before. Never missed a beat! Makes me excited for the album and its many songs!! 😎🌞🎸
🙌🏽
I get really emotional whenever I see Frusciante and his iconic '62 strat. So stoaked! Can't wait to see them live
Please come to Indonesia !!!!
John, don't you dare run off again! This is magic!
I'm glad that John returned to the line-up, but I'm upset that unfortunately you won't be able to come and hold concerts in Russia
It’s so awesome to hear you guys still play❕It Never gets old 🎸🔊
Как же я рад их видеть…
Да, энергия кончилась у старичков
it makes me so happy to see John playing with the band again…
1:18 do i hear some Irish sound
Gar nich mal so gut...

Перці все ще з перцем. Соло Джонні просто бомба. Як 15 років тому😌
Hey kidz... listen... samsara haz no beginning and nirvana... no end...
John Frusciante is ageless in every sense of the word, so glad he’s back
❤️
Boring. It´s What’s come to my mind. Frusciente is back with his “childish” chord progressions... a step back compared to the Josh era and the sofisticarion he brings to RHCP music. it’s like he said in the RHCP FB post for the launch of the single: they played EFFORTLESS. At least I agree on that point.
“What’s with his word pronouncements “Chiner on the derk side of the moon”
So great to see our boy John back home with the boys again! This gives me hope that all is not lost in this world.
Джон, Джон, Джон😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I needed this
Whatever bet Anthony lost to grow that 70’s ‘stache the statue of limitations (or is it the ‘Stach-u of limitations) should be over by now
RHCP never die 🌶
ABSOLUTLY BEAUTIFUL HOW MANY DIFFERENT LANUAGES ARE REPLYING TO THIS AWESOME SONG!  YOU GUYS HAVE TOUCHED THE WORLD!!!
I literally have no words right now. 😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sou fã. Sempre os melhores. Som incomparável. Por favor venham ao 🇧🇷
OMFG 😍
Real men don't kill coyotes
Lyrics- A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)    Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun     It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Guitar Solo]   Crack the flaming whip A-sailin' on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip     Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end   I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Will Ferrell doesn’t get enough credit for being such a great comedian and an amazing drummer. :p
Magnifique!!!!❤❤
THIS SONG IS NOT LONG ENOUGH!!!  PLAY IT MORE...DRAG THIS BABY OFF!  AMEN!
Lenin sticker on Flea's guitar ?! WTF ?!
🪶🪶🪶
¡Larga vida Frusciante, larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, impresionante sonido y energía que transmiten, bien hecho!
Emoción los descubrí hace poco y su música voló mí mente, y verlos juntos es una alegría inmensa
So good💯👑❤️
Look mom - no autotune
Da hora cheio de BR aqui hhahahah Red Hot Chilli Peppers é brabo demais, desde sempre. 🔥🇧🇷
Hi John. I waited.
本当にジョンが戻ってきてる(*^▽^*) うれしい(≧▽≦)
Considering that Anthony and Flea are almost 60 it's amazing they stil make video's with no shirt on and easily get away with it.
Will Ferrell's really rockin it
Keidis is bad ass on this. 🔥
Deutsch: Dieses Lied hier hört sich so ähnlich an wie Loner von BLACK SABBATH aus ihrem letzten Studioalbum 13 im Jahre 2013.  Englisch: This track here sounds a little bit like Loner from BLACK SABBATH of her last Album 13 from 2013.
Imagine if them dudes met up earlier in their lifes and played together... they wouldve been atleast in my opinion, one of the best bands in the world 🥦
FUCK YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Our Kings have arisen again to bless us ✨
🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 Long live RHCP 🌶️💥
Black sUmmer ARE Matter ))) НИчего нового. эксплуатация Ностальгии. ну молодцы но ...это старо. к сожалению.
The prodigal son is back! How we missed those deep solos, we love u John 🌶️✳️❤️
Nachos.
Nice song.

Молодцы старички-разбойники!!!!! Жду новое, старое, всё.... Россия любит вас.
Soy yo o es más de lo mismo?
Jhoooooooooon !!!!!!!
Es el sonido de mi juventud, gracias john frusciante por traer de nuevo tu talento. Los red hot significan mucho para mucha gente. Viva la música!

Браво! С возвращением!
Grandes, ya era hora del regeso. Saludos desde Ecuador
why is he trying to sound like gordon lightfoot
It's. So. Good. I'm so happy.
Ha vuelto la guitarra de John
What’s up with Anthony’s accent in the chorus?
Después de que salga trap por todos lados, escuchar esto es Medicina para la mente
They're really starting to look like a bunch of homeless guys who just ripped off a roadie's van.
C'est quoi cette fin de solo toute moisie..
John is back, and oh boy you can tell, also Chad's drums have recover their powerful presence, this is absolutely classic RHCP and I adore it, hope the rest of the album sounds as moving and astonishing as this track
Still 6pack on his stomach ! Amaizing 💪💪💪
beautiful seeing  John Frusciante again in a RHCP music video :')
I cannot get jiggy wit' 'dis....
Если бы Энтони поменял свои фишечные зубы на уродские виниры ,то это была бы его ошибка. Хочу всегда видеть такого ..
isso e bom demais
Its always nice to see the chili peppers release new music
Still Have All Album CD's, Some Cassettes, Merch & Hat Too. Worth Buying.Its 2022 & Still Going Strong.
Epic Voices & Masterpiece Songs Forever Guyz. Appreciate It. Keep It Going. God Bless You.
😃🙂😍🤘🖒👌👏👊✌🔥❤👋.
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE
How emphatic is the return of John Frusciante... Great to be back John!!!
Vengan de nuevo a Guatemala 🇬🇹🇬🇹 por favor!!!!
I am in love
I thought this was a joke video. From that squirrel  on his lip to the first lines of this song... and him trying to sound irish or somthig. No real song strength. No hooks  or vibe at all. Sad. Just cuz it's the Peppers you dont have to pretend it's good people. I luv the peppers but these last 10 years have been baad.oh well
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE    Slowed reverb
Well look at that, they did it again… Good on them guys. Take notes, kids: This is how you garage band for LIFE!
Thanks for this
Muito bom acertaram
Happy to see vintage instruments back in the music scene.
Sonunda ihtiyacım olan müzik...
รอคอยมาแสนนานกับมือมีตารคนนี้ เป็นเรื่องดีๆที่เกิดขึ้นบนโลก
Господи,спасибо -дождались❤️❤️❤️❤️
in the end he turned into the taxi driver from by the way 😆
Mmmm verdict is still out good to see John back, let's be honest they hit there peak at Blood Sugar had some pretty songs after but nothing as good as that entire album. Keep on truckin boys but little bit to poppy
Pag mamahal galing  sa aming mga Pilipino❤
Anthony looks good for a 60yo ex addict.
repeat repeat repeat
When there not singing about California 90% of the time, these guys ain't that bad i guess
Как же красиво они взрослеют..
Фасон тримають.
1:52  best part of the song. That guitar solo needs to be 10 hours long. Especially at 2:10  Way too short!
Long live RHCP 🤘🤘🤘
John Frusciante is BACK !!! <3
I FEEL so high.
This song oozes Stadium Arcadium Frusciante!!!
Baaaaaaammmmm
It's like going back in time - they sure know how to hit us with nostalgia. Much love for their quintessential style, but I do hope they spice up the rest of the album with something fresh though🌶️
good to see will ferrel back behind the drums
<3
PERÚ PRESENTEE
Awesome 🤩
THAT INTRO LICK OMFG
RHCP with John 😍
Wow.. Keanu Reeves is the new guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers 😱
Queremos a los chili peppers 🔥queremos a los chili peppers 🔥
John is back??? ufff.... :) :)
POV: I'm the only English comment
Só vai para frente com o John ❣️
Glad ur back Gs. We need a John backup vocal song again
Звук как будто 96 kbs
just enjoy it...
Happie to see john...
hey John.........
I first saw the Chili’s live in 2006 when I was 14 and John was part of the band. When he left I thought that’s it, I’ll never get the opportunity to see him live again but here we are ❤️😭 See you soon in Manchester! 😁
aMAZINg bANd
CARAJO, hay que pasar los 10 millones
Nobody asked for Anthony O’Kiedis.
Sweet
thought that was will ferrel on the drums for a second
Anthony mullet kiediss
My relatives.
Como recuerdo cuando en el verano del '99 escuché Sacare Tissue por primera vez, cambió mi adolescencia, ahorre de mis mesadas para comprar el disco original, y la verdad no me arrepiento, marco mi vida, gran banda y Frusciante es mítico, ojalá puedan venir mas bandas legendarias a darle sentido a esta nueva década!
Bro why tf are all these comments Spanish
I'm just here for Frusciante ❤️
A good song, a good video, a good  haircut on Anthony. After more than 30 years this guy still looks cool and  the band sounds great.
I love flea's part...especially his expressions. Good ol flea😍
That sea Shanty Irish tone is mesmorising.  How Anthony manipulates his tone around the beat and changes the pronunciation of words is what makes him so unique. He may not be a strong vocal range singer but his baritone and manipulation of tone Is insane and so distinctive. The only singer I know who can have a restricted range but make 12 albums sounds as interesting as the next with his tone manipulation. Doesn't get enough credit for singing. Everyone judges singi nng on range but if we focus on all aspects Anthony holds his own insanely well.
СПАСИБО! 💫
🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️
*red hot chili peppers are back WITH JOHN F.*
Why is Needles from Back to the future playing bass?
So good
"chinas on the durkside of the moon." WTF is this trash?
Just like yesterday ❣️
Like para que hagan gira en latinoamerica. We will wait for you in Mexico🙌🏼🙌🏼 🤞🏼
See John Frusiante with RHCP again makes me feel so happy :D
Love John's guitar, glad to see him back. Anthony looks a Lil like Joe Exotic 😅
Эти парни не стареют во всех смыслах. Круто!
Как всегда на коне, мега класс  👍
Es increíble como solo con la vuelta de John la banda completa tuvo un giro de 360° volviendo a su esencia
Grande Will Ferrell en la batería, crack!
I missed you guys !!!
ya me la sé pero no me encanta..o  todavía no lo sé.
Gold !!!!! 🔥🎶⭐️❤️
Very cool. Red Hot Chili Peppers is amazing
First
Sooooo glad John is back
I love rhcp but this is actually hot garbage,
🔥🔥🔥

One  Mixture between Californication and Slow Chetaah, lineal song, the bass in the mix almost don"t sound, we miss the vocals of John.  Guys very poor creative and bad musical video
https://youtu.be/azN10vd7EYQ
Yet another boring RHCP song. These guys are way past their prime.
I see he’s sporting an even gayer looking mustache .     He’s ridiculous looking.
gad no
It sounds like old red hot and new red hot perfectly mixed. Anthony sure has gotten better at singing now hasn’t he. And listening to the guys jam just never gets old.
Finally my homie frusciante came back ♥️
Grande diego verdager y el dios frusciante, a revivido la música señores 😎
Hello from Kazakhstan!😀🎼👍 Frusciante is a God!😀🎸🎼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They look and sound great
Love ❤️ the vibe..  bravo 🙌🏼 encore. 😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is worse than COVID.
Коммент для вывода в тренды
I can't believe I have been listening to these guys for 40 years!
I don’t really enjoy the more popular Chili Peppers songs, like Californication, Scar Tissue, Snow, etc are overplayed. I used to listen to them on repeat, though. But now, I’m more into less popular ones like This Velvet Glove, I Could Have Lied, Porcelain, more melancholic songs, but a few funk and some of the older album’s hits as well, but this song seems forgettable. It’s not bad but if this comes on a playlist I’d probably skip. Every RHCP album has good songs though, so I am looking forward to seeing the rest.
Red hot salva minha vida todo dia!! obrigado!
♥️🇧🇷♥️
Kinda weak and stale tune to be honest, musically speaking quite a poor result. Individual musicians are outstanding, but the poppy cliched tune is just boring. Where's innovation from RHCP? None to be found here, unfortunately. No edge, just old dudes jumping around, stuck in time. You gotta move forward, which is the most difficult thing to do in life
Self reminder: Check again in 10 years, it will be as cool as now 02/2022.
That’s a racist song title what do you mean “black” summer?
I dunno why they criticize Kiedis' way of singing here. I think it's cool for the song and brings a little bit more texture.
Si cazzo!!!!! ❤️
Os bons tempos estão de volta 🍃🔥
one more for the playlist🔥♥️
Божественная гитара Фрушанте)
they are back once again !!! Best biethday gift EVER !!!
Lmaoo I thought he was holding a metal detector in the pic.. 😂😂😂
Ahhh, so refreshing to hear the magic notes of Frusciante. Getting older my RHCP but never fail to deliver!
Los amo
bit of a sunday morning type song...u"d think after not releasing a song 4 ages they would be lookin to get the hype happnin again
Легенды
When new album?
This band truly sucks, but goddamn,  John Fruscante’s guitar playing has a authentic voice (fleas a great personality too)
https://youtu.be/LAuVVenidRA
Dope
welcome back John!
Why does he sound like Gordon Lightfoot in the first few verses? Kinda weirded me out. The rest was good.
No way. JOHN IS BACK WITH THEM ???
Os caras não mudam, parece que tocam sempre a mesma música. Lembro que depois de Californication eles falaram que encontraram a fórmula. Depois do álbum é só repetição do que já foi feito.
So glad they're still making music! Keep rock alive!
Frusciante est de retour et sa s entend . Merci mes Red Hot vous êtes les meilleurs y a pas de doutes . Vivement votre album en avril 🇫🇷💋
The only bad thing bout this song is that is too short
I feel like when Anthony is 80, that hes still going to perform shirtless 😂
Are you kidding me. This sounds like crap
would be better without anthonys dancing
hello guys what the whole world loves you for so long I am very glad that you are back and the track is also great I wish you all inspiration and health 👍👍👍
Thank God for Frusciante..
Estos viejos se pasaron crecí escuchando RHCP
Iconic and timeless already
LOS AMO TODA LA VIDA
He’s back,he’s back!!!
Awesome uplifting song song with stellar performances from all members. John’s guitar exudes like warm Californian sun.  Thank you guys for this energetic pick-me-up!
Они вернулись,пацаны вернулись 🥲🥲🥲😘😘😘
Masterful as always. You guys make my soul happy.
hello old friends... ecstatic to hear from you again
💯🤘
haha! More boring garbage from the Chili Poopers!
i swear the day that anthony puts on a shirt is the day when I finally snap for real
That ist Amazig nice Shit yeaah
Un colpo al cuore quando esce frusciante 💓😍😍😍💓
Vai tomar no cu! maior banda de todas. ponto.
Que buena rola
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life887
Come to India, Rhcp!  🇮🇳🇮🇳
RED HOT without John are not RED HOT. He is enormous . What a fucking solo here !
ชอบมาก
This shit rules.
He's singing about Black coffee and a banana in case you were wondering. 😌
Como sempre EXCELENTE! ❤
John!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Rhcp are back ! Thank's for that m......... Er teach of pop funk ! Fruciante is THE Guy !
God its good to see john back it just seems right even thos josh was amazing and i must say Anthonys mullet is so cool hopefully he grows it out long
Gracias por está canción, son los mejores
I need the complete album right now!!!!!
Welcome back‼️John‼️ 💞from 🎌
Ladies and gentlemen, someone is playing real music again. Welcome back boys. Welcome back.
this is bullshit
fruscianteee🔥🔥
yo will ferrels really good at drums
My favourite band of all time still killing it! So glad frusciante is back! Epic solo in the middle. Can't wait to see them live in London this year!
Reminds me of the By the Way album, loving the new tune!!
That bass guitar 🎸😘👌👂
And just like that, something finally is right again in the world! Welcome back John! Thank you!
I’ve only listened to 2 RHCP songs before seeing this but I can confidently say it is great
You can't deny them. They live up to being a legend.
Con John frusciante en la banda todo es perfecto, todo volvió a su lugar, todo volvió a la normalidad.
I didn’t know how much I needed this song right now. RHCP forever & always sound amazing. I love this so much!
The chili peppers hold a special place in my heart. However I don’t love this song. It’s refreshing to hear John’s signature warm fuzzy tone back however Anthony’s vocals are lacking, he’s never been the best singer and that’s fine but this song just seems… corny. The prechorus feels rushed and the transition from chorus into verse 2 seems maybe not mixed well idk then the chorus starts again abruptly. I love the chili’s and fru is the greatest inspiration to me but this song seems a bit forced or maybe/ hopefully a transition back to the chore of the group, or they’re just getting old idk. Just my thoughts on my favorite band of all time
finally!!!!!! best formation RHCP 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Terrible.  No soul.  No riff.  No good melodies.  Solo is decent.  It's a mess.  Hope the rest of the album is better.
What a surprise🔥🤘🏼
Ура!!! Ждем вас в России! ❤️
Alguien sabe que le dijeron al anterior guitarrista cuando decidieron que regresaba frusciante?
Damn Anthony keeping them abs in check
Love Will Ferrell on the drums
Frusciante is the main pepper
So good to see Frusciante back. He did some very cool noises at the end of his solo
Esta canción es intrascendente, la fórmula , incluso el sonido el solo de John,una decepción...
Hoy el día que cumplo un año mas de vida los Red Hot me regalan este single Gracias por este regalo de cumpleaños 🎁 se que Unlimited Love será todo un éxito! El rock nunca morirá! Larga vida a mi vida y a este arte que tanto me apasiona llamada música.
Anthony looks incredibly fit for a near 60yr old, John looks healthy as Eva, Flea with cheeky smile still having fun, Chad the cool cucumber. Plenty of amazing days to come for these cool cats..🥰
Aaaaaa keren mereka comeback akhir nya setelah musik penuh rnb dan kpop mereka comeback .....
I love RHCP but these lyrics sound like they were written by a middle school student
🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 viva o rock!
Llevo escuchando como 5 años a los rhcp y se ha vuelto en una de mis bandas favoritas, lastima capaz nunca vengan a Ecuador :( me encanta como en cada disco mantienen su esencia, literal cualquier persona podría escuchar dos canciones o más de ellos en la radio y de una los identificarla, tiene un sonido muy caracteristico
Every time John leaves; I leave. They aren't the same without him. Welcome back John! Welcome back RHCP!
<3
So.......is Flea on the drug that killed River Phoenix??
gitarane yahud pisan, jos pancen wonge
I thought this was a solid single at first. Was kinda disappointed even. Then after couple listens certain parts really stuck out. John's solo, while simple, was the most impressive.   Took me about 10-15 listens to fully digest this song, and when I did WOW, it hit me all at once, amazing. Definitely a slow burn 🔥 Can't friggin' wait for the other 16 songs!!!
Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok this is fkn amazing! 🗣OK?!
Wow that’s awesome love this ❤️ love

I wanna see these boys do a doors tribute album b4 they die, love yall chili peppers
Pokonamah moal gagal... Idola 👍🇮🇩🇮🇩
最高です。
My high school girlfriend bought Blood Sugar Sex Magik when it dropped.  I'm still in contact with her.  I might have to gift her this new album for turning me on to these guys all those years ago!
We get getting hit with those Luck of the Irish vocals
the best
Will someone tell Tony how lame his mustache is? Not cool.
Джон вернулся. Наконецто!
Welcome home John.
Love to see you back John F.
Grande Will Ferrell, de actor y productor a baterista. Que talentoso resultó 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Banging!
This is a band of brothers. They will be here as long as they can till they are old and grey. Love this band they are hall of famer.
00:47 eu gritei "OLHA O JOHN MANOOOOOOOOO"
Killing it, as always. The older they get the better, like wine.
🌶️🌶️🌶️🤟🏻🤟🏻🔥🔥🔥
See why this has so many views. Such a good band that has stuck with that signature sound for so long. Love it.
Frusciante is too good for this song.
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
oohhh no my boy!  <3
I can't believe Flea and Anthony Kiedis are pushing 60.  They look phenomenal.
Those are some interesting/embarrassing dance moves from old Anthony kiedis.   Then again, good to be old and not give a fuck.
Sorry for Hillel and Josh but the Red Hot's guitarist always been John. He made evolve the Red Hot's sound with his musicality and his incredible gift. So that's the result, 15 years later best song since Stadium era. Good to see them back, ALL... 🥰
🌶 🔥
EPIC!
FLEA!!!! :)
Loved it, the RHCP are back and not missing a beat with their signature sound. Paired with the delightfully weird video, this is a win!
Ellos significan mucho para mi, fueron el sonido de mi adolecensia y en la busqueda de mi identidad, verlos regresar los cuatro con ese sonido es increible.
So happy Johns back in the band!
FANTASIC !! WELCOME BACK JOHN!
Guitar solos are back 😭
Y cuando anuncian Tour Mundial??? 🙏🏻🇵🇪
que bien! excelente! que alegría volver a ver a John!
¿ no es increíble que después de tantos añoos
아니 기다렷다구우우은우ㅜㅜㅜㅜlove u from koreaaaa
AAAAAAAAAAA me encanta lo amo me gusta fuuuuck es buenisimoooo! <3
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Long live Red Hot.. 👍
Amazing
Anthony looks healthy, Flea is still funky wild, Chad is on point, and Mr. Frusciante is back \m/
damn its liks the only who has not aged much is John - Anthony has certainly aged fast lol
vamos la concha de la lofa
what the hell happened to his voice?
When I saw John, I felt as a child opening his Xmas gift 🥲🥲
John, please don’t leave us again man.
MUCH LOVEEEEEE
Ctm, aguante los red hot Queremos a los chili peppeeers queremos a los chili peppeeeeerssss
Ummmm pirate auto tune?
Instant classic
Perfect 🔥🔥🔥🔥
So grateful :)
Ganialidad, esta banda lo es todo! Genial RHCP, tanta espera para esta joya y las que vienen
Wtf were those vocals lol
Manteepp gaan...
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Legends ❤️
That little slow reveal of Frusciante! Definitely wasn’t expecting that. Glad to see them together again. That was epic!
does i body else think this is a little bit calmer than there older music i mean im not  complaining because there is a new song by the chili peppers song and soon to be a new album.
Son, fueron y serán mi banda favorita, fin.
This song gets better and better with every listen.  Seeing and hearing these 4 people play together again is emotional
YAWN
No thanks
This honestly sounds like late 90s RHCP. I love it!
Ficou muito foda a música, que venha o disco
The guitar solo was killer John, im so glad to hear some new music from RHCP!
All I’m going to say is… John killed it.
Gran regreso!!! pocas bandas reflejan tanta energía !!!!!! Larga vida!!
Son arte, esa esencia única los amoooo 🛐
Лучшие! Были и остаются! Перцы 🤩😍 🌶 с любовью из России 🇷🇺 Ждём концерты  🙏🏼
Reply, reply and reply... and I want hear this song again and again. Thank you for this music, wizards of rock
So John is back!!
Me hacen llorar de la emoción, estuve esperando tanto esto que ahora que lo veo no me lo creo. Maravilloso sencillo y que energía tan perfecta, son mis dioses y les rezo todos los días. Ahora solo me falta verlos en vivo con john, aunque muera en ese concierto de un paro cardíaco. Te amo john y RHCP HASTA LA MUERTE! 🖤*️⃣❤️
Постарели то как перцы
They're back!!!
listening to it felt like my long lost bestfriend, who i haven't seen for years, suddenly knocked on my front door.
nao tem como nao gostar LOVE RHCP
Zzz...
I like to see a kind of analogy between Flea and Angus Young 😎 Behind the singer, these two guys (!!) brand their band with their own distinctive and personal way of playing and moving, which people recognize immediately. Maybe even more than the singer himself.
Dont like that voiceprocesessing , Anthonys voice just clean and dry has a rawness thats now cleaned up
Meh
Damn John is on fire with those background...I'm loving it Love from Bhutan 🇧🇹
Woah I didn't know Joseph Gordon Levitt sang for the chilli peppers!?? He's come a long way from stoner movies!!
Meh......
ดีอะ
John eleva o Red hot
since 02' never letting me down
i feel like im 13 again, thank you RHCP =D
big fan but i didn;t like this song that much...but excited to see what they got coming the boys are back in town!
Love it♥️
Frusciante's killing it.
Y ya van como unas 300 veces en el primer día que lo voy escuchando!!! Por siempre Peppero!!!
LOS AMOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭
Obrigada por mais essa, Chili Peppers!!
Meh. These guys still have ears on them and they need to release something with more energy to it. This could’ve easily come out in 2010. They say rock is dead, maybe we should make it sound more alive? Maybe the next single or the album will be cool. Too soon to tell. Like turn your amps up and ditch the quantized pro tools feel. The genre is not at home there.
Do i hear autotune????
Y ya van como unas 300 veces en el primer día que lo voy escuchando!!! Por siempre Peppero!!!
Thank you best band of the world Red Hot Chilli Peppers!  Man when I saw the video I was like that dude looks like John Frusciante but I thought it was Josh with long hair.  But the sound of that guitar hit different and sure the dude is Mr John  Frusciante!!  What a surprise!  2022 started right
Woooooo frusciante volviste con tu familia 🙏🙏🙏
Love it! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Viva la RHCP! 🌶
"A new RHCP single with John Frusciante back? Psshh. Yeah, that'll definitely happen...on the day that 'All the Lights...' by GY!BE gets leaked!" - me in 2017,  probably.
[Lyrics] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Frusciante all day long.
The drums are the same as a million songs I’ve heard before.
John is so cool.
Hey, can anyone tell me where the Red Hot Chili Peppers are from? They’re very vague about it and I think they should just come clean. What are they trying to hide?
John is the man
Какой кайф!
❤️
This is no good.
They still got it... Completely. Like we never left... And like they never left
About time! The boys are back and about to rock the fuckin planet!!
Buenos tiempos, excelente música.
Hey Anthony, love the new song but.....lets see you without the stache again.. Come on, for us
RHCP 🔥
Ya era hora!! Gracias rhcp
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the Moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the Sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailing on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end Aqui é Brasil!!! 🇧🇷🤟🏻❤️❤️
Love how you can instantly feel John
Will Ferrell slayin' it on the drums
Woo!
👏👏👏👏👏
no sabía que SILVERIO cantaba en los rhcp
Узнаю старых, добрых перцов🔥🔥🔥
🙏🏻💥💥💥💥
We needed this without knowing we needed it, ya know?
LOS LEGENDARIOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS DE REGRESO
Frusciante's touch is magic! Classic RHCP!
#VENGANaARGENTINA🙏🙏🙏🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏☺️
Zarpado!!!
1:52 no puedo parar de repetir ese soloo🔥😭😭🔥 GRACIAS RHCP🌶  😭
да
Would be a great song if Anthony wasn’t singing. Not sure what accent to trying for but it’s not working for him.
Frusciante es medio equipo en la banda,las pruebas 👆
La vuelta de Frusciante hace revivir a la banda, suena brutal el single y están en plena forma!!! 🔥💪🏼🤘🏻
wowwww yaaaa sounds like old school chilli peppers with those guitar riffs
Me va a dar algo! 🥺❤️🤟🏻
Rolon
The boys are back in town!
Stadium arcadium vibes! 🌶️❤️🔥
Not in love with this one, honestly
Oh My Dis Side
I wonder how  Anthony Kiedis keeps his shredded fight club crack addict body type and yet he has been sober for years, that dudes a machine
🤪
真心希望他們可以來臺灣開唱
Thank you, Red Hot Chili Peppers!
A melhor banda do mundo !!! LOVE YOU GUYS
This might be the greatest new RHCP since Californication days. Absolutely legendary.
Wat een fantastisch nummer! Erg onder de indruk, kijk uit naar het nieuwe album!
Long live Frusciante
Grande Diego!
великолепно!!
Anthony still super fit after all of these years! 😳
while it definitely still is their sound and style, I honestly find this song a little poppy for my tastes.  but glad to see em back, and mad respect for staying true to themselves
Beautiful 💓 Great music ,the sound iconic  Well-done guys !!!! Love the lyrics genius!!! The film clip is awesome 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Me recuerda a Slow Cheetah. Aún así, qué bueno verlos juntos de nuevo, larga vida RHCP! 🌶️❤️
Amazing. Thank you 😊 💓 ✌
where's the elctric powers at?
Hey is it just me or this song sounds like slow cheetah??
Jhon back?
Ahhh this is the song
John Frusciante= GOD
Today I feel happy, I'm in love again
Yep, they suck even more as old guys… What is with that Gordon Lightfoot accent Anthony Kidus now uses? This is one of the worst songs of 2022 so far.
Simplesmente a melhor banda atemporal do entretenimento 🇧🇷
Lucky they have Jon. He is the grease.
Yaaaaay! Johns back baby!
DEMMMMMMM BROOOO  FUCKING LIFETIME WAITING FOR THISSS
Veeeengan a Peruuuuuu!!!! 🙏
Meh
A win win for all
RHCP with Frusciante back.  It can't get any better than that.
N I c e new songs from red hot chili  peppers
Another one. 👏
Just pure magic 😄
Surprised at the topic
Amazing job gr8 sound and like always brilliant music guys
Necesito un like mas grande
Anthony really ruined this fucking track.
Long live RHCP .. . . .
love this new track
Meh.......
There's  a reason most of these comments aren't English  😒
The single guitar for the entire song including during the solo and outro is so nice. I’m so used to everyone recording the ghost rhythm guitar track and layering guitars that this felt great in my ears. Good job guys!

I'm a huge Chili Peppers fan. And I'm disappointed. It's not a bad song. Just that this is just the same stuff you've done since Stadium Arcadium. I hope the next single is different. Sorry guys.
simple... Best of the Best......👽👌👽👌👽👌
I’m waiting for RHCP to reach my corner of the world so I can take my tickets and see them play this live mofo!!!
Glad to see Will Ferrell’s dad on the drums again!  😂😂😂
Why is he pronouncing his Rs like that?
it fits perfectly on the end of the f***in world vibes...
Anthony's rocking the hell out of that stache and soul patch!
🔥🔥♥️
E diferente quando eles estão em sintonia
Thanks for starting the music immediately in this music video.
God I love this band so much. Im glad that they are back.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this but what's up with the weird Irish fake lilt to the words?
Du cá******
😁😁😁
😯 Oh wow, you mean to tell me that the Red Hot chili peppers are still around and making music yet. so cool
Y’all have no idea how much hearing new music from y’all just made my year far much better!
✌️
I noticed this and said "what?"  " A new song? I say!!! Rejoice!"

Esto no es el Stand del pollo eléctrico :(

If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
NO DISRESPECT to Josh Klinghoffer, he did amazing with them, but Frusciante is a once-in-a-lifetime guitarist, and his chemistry was sorely missed from that era of the band.
Their sound is unique in the sense I don't associate it with any time period
✨
Haven’t checked into rchp in a minute. The second I heard the intro riff I thought oh shit Frusciante must be back
Red Hot Chili Peppers Red Hot Chili Peppers Red Hot Chili Peppers John John John
Magnífico
The return of Guitar Jesus 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Its exciting to watch all the members reunited🙌. I have no doubt  their music will be remarkable💛
Love the peppers, love this song. Great job guys! This is classic RHCP. I've been a fan for 25 years. However I'm going to be critical for a second. Does anyone else think there is a tad bit too much auto tune on Anthony's voice in the verses? I hate that producers rely so much on computers now. These guys are legends they certainly don't need the help. Other than that, an instant classic.
Es bellísimo ❤️ un amor tremendo le tengo a esta banda 😍
I dig it. Sounds familiar yet fresh. Johns playing stands out to me. Love seeing them back!
Great tune❤
Not one mention of California?! Preposterous.
Vrau é posse gabigol
Best of the Best. Good Luck
It’s awesome how a band like Red Hot Chilli Peppers can stick true to their original sound and make an excellent alternative song when more and more bands don’t stick true to what originally made them successful in the first place
Johns solos are back ♥
😍
My heart feels full right now!!! RHCP! ❤️
✳
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥....we cried..we love it ...thank you guys we cant wait to hear the rest...we see you! give Rick a hug for us . LOVE
Yall are so amazing🔥🔥🤘🏾🤘🏾 So proud to forever be a fan🥰🥰
Постарели немного, но всё так же горячи🔥 🔥 🔥 Обожаю вас парни 💋❤️💕❤️💗
Love this band.anthony is looking so much like Iggy pop, brother from another...
Will Ferrell looking good
Qué chingona rola
Love everything about this song. Love you Guys. Love you Tony for ever.
The best  🔥 ... Jhon comeback ,🔥🔥🔥
Joyotaaa, agradecida por estooo.🔥🔥🔥😭
CARALHOOOOO QUE MÚSICA FODA
That guitar fells so good
A moment of silence for those fallen ones that couldn’t be here with us to watch these 4 giants get back at it again.   RCHP fan for life!!!!
Love it!!!
❤
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
What a waste of time. They are not ""Red Hot", they aren't hot or  luke warm...tepid perhaps? It's like high school talent show warbling squared. what a slug. Cheers!!!!
Красивые музыка и пение, красивый клип.
💯
Great to see Will Ferrell back on those drums! 😍👌
is no one going to talk about what the fuck is going on with Anthony Kids' voice??
Andddd another banger!
R.I.P Diego Verdaguer✨
Loyd Christmas has done it again!
Mds não estava esperando aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Como se nota la influencia en guitarra de Frusciante, con Josh no pasaba nada
It makes me so happy to see John back where he belongs!
Good to have some familiarity back. Very peaceful
New RHCP?! Hypeeee
Ok ok ok …. I’m not actually hating it. I was a little scared … like Oh man, please don’t let this be some new woke shit!  Not bad. Keep rockin. Also John F. looking better than ever !!!! Wow
Year is 365 days long...day is 24hs long....joy and happiness is a Black summer song of 3:53 long...and a higher way of art is Frusciante´s solo...
Great song: video is a little over the top.  Would have kept it more simple like playing on santa Monica peer, around deserted sites affected by the pandemic, empty rooms full of take out and feeling of loneliness. But either way happy with the song.
glad to see frusciante back but this shit sucked
I think we’ve all been waiting to move on,awesome song to get it started😎😎😎
Já imagino as variações de solos do Frusciante no ao vivo e ainda com essa guitar histórica
Hell yeah!!!
Los unicos con su esencia , que felicidad escuchar algo asi 🥰
This reminds me of first hearing Californication, good times!!!
Obrigada RHCP❤❤❤❤❤❤
🌶🔥🎸🤙
Hello.. welcome back Mr. John Frusciante. Glad to hear your guitar sound again..
We don’t need a new  hot chili  peppers there old music is way better
thank you for staying alive ❤❤❤
I L Y R H C P © ✊🏽
Un grupo que marco bastante influencia en mi juventud , que grata sorpresa que estren esta canción despues de años y coincida con el cumpleeaños nro 7 de mi hijo mayor ❤🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
RHCP with Frusciante :O ! I feel 15 years old again! Good Music is all we need!!
forever young RHCP, thank you for the timeless music you share, Love it!!!
Literally wtf is this song about and when did will ferrell join a band
Give up the ghost, dudes. Your like a perety of yesteryear. I mean, crap your last hit was plagerizing a old Tom Petty song. Please stop for the sake of what dignity you have left.
Thank god you're back together again, Just the way it has to be.
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ROCK HERITAGE! LIKE WINE, THE OLDER, THE BETTER!
Can't wait to see John Frusciante and his 3 uncles live this year!
Daaamn they still killin it. Love this track
Yesss Frusciante comes back...
Love Jhon!
Its been a long time since I made a new friend.....
What is Flea wearing and where can I get one?
This song already sounds like it's been an established hit for years, that is how cohesive these four are as a unit. Clinical. The Chili Peppers are back, baby!  Can't wait for the rest of the album. So stoked!

John Frusciante is a guitar god
Good to see John back. Josh will get his turn again, I'm sure.
They are really back!!!!! I already love this song!!1
What a truly pleasant surprise
Fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
Wow amazing and great music. Red hot chili peppers one of the best band. John best guitar for this band
That's SOO GOOOD☺️🤗😹🥰✌️
I don’t think America can take the violence and destruction of another black summer.
Esses 4 juntos não erram nunca!
These guys look and sound like they have played together before.
This song gives some Hendrix vibes
Yeaaaaah Red hot chilli peppers!
Se extrañaba a john frusciante :')
With Frusciante back on line up they are on another level.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I love you guys❤️✨✨ your songs always make me feel good and kinda living life through ❤️
Best RHCP in a long time. It just keeps getting better.
hmno... con lo que saaaaleen  :,,3
Amo a esta banda,  son los mejores ❤
Ted churipao!

Great song but I can't wait to hear Anthony Kiedis try to belt out that song live.
Too generic

perfect song is a master piece
Still feeling like classic RHCP. Absolutely love it and the guys look great.
1:51 puta riff a la Jimi Hendrix!
Love it . So glad to hear some new stuff ... Looks like it's going to be a great summer hit 🎯🎯🎯 ☮️☮️☮️💟💟💟
Eu chorei
I liked the song til I realized who it was....seems too affected, especially the vocal, prefer this, about an actual incident of a nut murdering a doctor who did abortions   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBxQ1peUgQ
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back!
Good to see Will Ferrel still playing drums
Este es el estilo que siempre me gustó de los red hot 😊😊
Glad to see will Ferrell was able to join you on drums
Does Anthony have an Irish accent now?
Que grande Anthony, se tiró el 7
Awsome stuff chilli peppers great to see you back new music 🤘

😍😍😍😍💕
Achei que seria um ano difícil, mas com RDHCP tudo fica mais leve
I look forward to my reaction and interpretation of Johns solos as much as I do Anthonys lyrics. Or atleast i used to, but now i can again. I’m so happy. Shoutout to flea n chad, love yall too. And josh! :)
❤❤‍🔥🤘
moral viu
These guys are great, I really like this song, I have some Californication vibes with this
I guess the adults care center got a new green screen
🔥🔥🔥
John working that boss chorus ensemble  nice.... We love the tone of this song.... Were right there with ya'
Really impressed they managed to get Will Ferrell to play the drummer
We'll see if the titty baby gets made and leaves again, gets replaced, then comes crawling back a decade later again.
how old was he in this video?
thx！！rhcp！！！
Que buenas vibras, que emoción!!
My boys. .are right were they need to be.... Were with ya.
Nuevo tema!!! Siiiiiiiiiiii
Normal Person: Rock is dead.  Me as an intellectual: Yeah the 3 Million Views in less than a day says otherwise.
Nowadays I can live again after listened them,  ty Jesus
The fist sounds of the guitar have great influence of hendrix. And the vocals reach a big point. Grrat song of the RHCP. Congrats.
THAT FUCKING ROCKED
I can derelic my own balls, zoolander joined the chilli peppers
Allahım eriyorum
Lendas
What an amazing return for John, and man all four here are just great, I'm excited for all the new songs!
Sin perder eso que tanto los caracteriza, espero que este nuevo álbum los haga salir de gira y que incluyan a México como sede de su cartelera.  Chulada el sencillo. 👌🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Black summer has put the red hot chilli peppers back in black!
The best news in years Frusciante returned to rhcp excellent!!
Flea is looking really OLD.
fraco demais... mais do mesmo
I did not know Will Ferrell and Keanu Reeves was in this bend 😀
Всё так же хороши
WAW, pire nouveau clip que j'ai vu depuis des années, mais le son est incroyable, je vous aime :)
Just ask satan for a loan next time you need cash, the music just ain't hitting anymore. You need another Dream of Californiavacation[from making music]... p3rmanently is pr3ffered
WTF is this
eargasm
Wuuuuiii 🥺🖤 Red Hot volvieron
Los Red Hot Chili Peppers volvieron a ser Los Red Hot Chili Peppers 👏🔥
This band legend
Me encanta! Gracias por seguir haciendo música para nosotros! ✨💞 Por favor, sean eteeernos! No mueran nuuunca! Permítanos disfrutarlo toda la vida!🎶✨
❤️
Y es cuando vuelves a volar con la armonía de FRUSCIANTE, temaso de temasos
This is absolute garbage 🗑
Ficou muito bom👏👏👏  hed hot chili Peppers é a melhor banda de todos os tempos, ainda mais agora com o john Frusciante 👍😍
Perfect..
The band is back WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ちょうど20年目のレッチリの枯れた音 最高かよ
Glad that Will Ferrell's music career is still going strong
Tatooine reference???
Thanks God Frusciante is back 🙏🏾🙏🏾  Long Life to RHCP!! 🚀🚀🚀🎸 🎸 🎸
RHCP Forever 🌶🎸 Yeahhhhhh 🤟🏾🤟🏾
Oh my god those vocals
THEYRE BACK
Good tune! Has that Feel!
Great to see John back!  Good song - not a stellar hit but good start to great things ahead.  The 70’s mustache should go…. I’m honest.
Always loved John’s sound. Put your best noise canceling head phones on, get comfy and go for a Chili Peppers ride. Awesome tune and can’t wait to experience the rest of the album so I can trip through the cosmos.
RHCP and Foo Fighters need to retire... thanks, please no more... lol, I'll leave it at that boys
My tears !! Ahhhh
I'm obsessed already, truly an awesome song, so glad for some new RHCP they are ever evolving and have our unlimited love
Those three still work well together soldi musicians and John has always had a sound. Tony is tired and boring but his moves are just laughs le now. Oh well, everything is finite.
🤘🙏🤘....... 🌟✌🌟
this was kinda mid
Que bonita sensación verlos juntos otra vez 🥲
I see what they did there on this month with the title
Y un día volvieron! Amo RHCP 🌶🌶🌶🌶
se ve tan virtuoso a john con la guitarra y a la vez tan estilistico , se nota que ahora su guitarra sera mas completa y llena que antes
the most fucked up, I loved the music, hugs from Brazil
Thank you RHCP....
Just what I needed. Thanks universe I see u there.
Brabo apenas.
Frusciante with the Peppers again! 😍😍😍🎸🤘
Usłyszałam ich mając 10 lat i nagle  miałam po co żyć. To moja zagubiona dusza się odnalazła.🌞  Dawniej wolałam słuchać płyt, z czasem pokochałam oryginalne wersje koncertowe i nie potrafię bez nich żyć.🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ To moje uzależnienie😍 da się z nim żyć. Pozdrawiam uzależnionych od chili.🌚🌝🌚🌝
Black Summer must be this Pandemic matrix. And China, the dark side of the Moon? Well played RHCP 👏 🙃
QUE MUSICAO DAPORRA 🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏😍😍💓💓💥👏👏👏🌄🌶️
DAMA DEMA DING DONG, girl
Escuchando desde Chile 🇨🇱
Weird Al?
Заебись
I  L❤️VE  RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 😍
Es que red hot chili peppers      Es que red hot chili peppers siempre son lo mejor
Lots of messages in this song
チャドのドラムの入り方神
Meio country esse som
cough cough* jojo reference... cough cough*
🤘🏻😱❤
RHCP uds. Son lo máximo, los amooo👍🙂🌼🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤗
This shit slaps!
ヤバ過ぎ
I'm not going to sugar coat it.  That was just terrible.  I was a huge fan of them in the late 80s early 90s.  Man were they unique and great.  They peaked at BSSM.  A handful of okay attempts since but mostly just boring pop radio songs to reach the def tone young generations. That was just garbage.  No longer the band  I fell in love with.  So sad as I was really hoping they would redeem themselves.
Barrilete cósmico!!
The real and unique RHCP sound....
Este será un gran año
Hallo auch zurück.... Spätzünder...du wartest worauf? Drück dich ganz und gar aus...in Fleisch und Blut nach wie vor...oder bleib blind und stumm. Wir wissen wer wir sind....also wozu noch das Versteckspiel? Bist du reif und heil angekommen? Kennst du die Antwort? Frage....willst du....oder willst du nicht?Molare Sache oder nicht?
Os caras do RHCP tudo tiozão agora.
Nivel medio para mí gusto
Simplemente amo a esta banda, y en estos momentos tan difíciles escucharlos juntos de nuevo hace que vuelvan mis fuerzas, grandes, y gracias Josh ojalá un día pueda escuchar a los 5 juntos
This is great and glad they're back, Anthony Kiedis kinda lookin like a dark haired Joe Exotic out here
I hope this a new jojo stand for jojolands.
love and support guys (*˘︶˘*).｡*♡
Love it!
Finally something good happens!!!!!!
Buying
I feel so lucky I will see them live this year in Santa Clara, CALIFORNIA!! Row 10 on the field. My parents took my older teen sister to see them with Stone Temple Pilots in 2000 at Fresno, CA. I was too young at the time but I got to see STP later in Fresno and now I finally can make my dream come true to see RHCP and with John back!!
👌👌
big love from japan❤️‍🔥
Awesome!
Definitivamente el estilo de Frusciante da un toque de calidad a la banda.
Great sound. John Frusciante, always an innovator.
Thanks rhcp
Are the dream makers, and we are the dreamer of dreams.
Surely he will look back in a few years and regret that 'tache?
Rhcp lendas vivas,na crista da onda em 1989 knock me dow
*acabei de tentar fazer uma musica aqui no canal poderia avaliar?* 💕
I’ve been waiting for a new Red Hot Chilli Peppers song
Eles estão de volta, e com o John! Eu tô muito emocionada 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gracias RHCP!  ME ENCANTA ESA BANDA 😃
dude you are 59 but you look like 35
WELCOME BACK JOHN! NOW THEY'RE GOING TO REACH PLATINUM STATUS ONCE AGAIN!!!!
LETS FUCKING GO LETS FUCKING GO CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK
Una reunion despues de tanto me huele a retiro :c
Se que volverán a perú, lo sé.
putek solid pdin samahan nyo at mga kantahan mga idol ..napanood ko docu nyo solid mula nung una palang may magical potion na kayo na gamit kaya nakakagawa kayo ng pulidong kanta..sana makachill ko kyo cheers ,👌
Does Anthony sound like he's singing with an Irish accent during the verses or is that just me?
I see you got your guitar player back ..one of em lol
buena canción, como pasa el tiempo ya están señores :S
No one:  Literally no fucking one:  Vocalist: *Remove Clotes*
Are these creatures human? what happened to humanity???
Nice to see Will Ferrell back behind the cans.
Vamosss !!!!! Aguanten los PEPPERS!!!! ♥
Uh la la, chulada. 🤙🤙
Ay ay captain!
レッチリが帰ってきたンゴ
Red Hot Forever
Legends. I’ve listened 20+ times and already wanna hear it again.
Happy fan here
China is on the dark side of the moon……….
Sounds just like their old stuff. Loving it man. A breath of fresh air. Beautiful. Thanks boys. 👌😃
Will ferrell the best of them.
I'm so curious, interpretation varies   Intro sounds like the state of current event affairs relating to forest fires and California  No new friends in a while, black summer, my friend whom isn't into their lives says it reminds him of the depression with the covid lock downs and not seeing people as much. It also represents Blackie, AK's dad.  It could be a ton of things. I love it, to each their own
Sounds like the b side stuff on old albums
This music video feels like a fever dream.
Ojo
my guess....they wrote it in the summer of '20, it was a black summer bc they live in LA (me 2) and the libs locked it down, so it ruined summer.  Lock down = no friends.  Cali going thru a drought.  Never know when the libs end the lock down and ruin people's lives.  Censorship ....true - we are losing free speach ( dem libs ).  Song has a strong covid over tone.  How bout you?  What's your take?
do these guys still sleep w 14 year olds on tour?
really good song, when I first heard it thought the song was by Metallica...particularly something similar to the Unforgiven trilogy or something from Reload
Will Ferrell still playing drums for them?
Terrible
Will Ferrell still got mad drumming skills!
New Chilli Peppers with Fruciante! This makes me genuinely excited about 2022. Thank you for bringing so much joy at a time when people need some joy.
Red Hot de volta ao topo 😍 John é incrível, com ele a banda fica em outro nível .
Круто👹✊✊✊
JOHN IS BACK!!!!! This news just made 2022 a fantastic year! ❤️😎✊
for some reason it reminds me to under thr bridge a looot
Está vez cuando vuelvan a Argentina no me los pierdo por nada. Aguante los red hot la concha de loraaaaaaaa!!!!!
Kusheen was here...
BLACK SUMMER  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Why does this song give me Jethro Tull vibes?
Anthony is gonna be 60 this year and still looks like he's in his 40's
Jesus ... i mean .. jesus
Épica  canción
This song would be much better if it was an instrumental.
Just what we need!! More RHCP!!
At last
Džon se vratio kući.
All I have to say is...FUCK YES!
Awesome 🤙
So beautiful 😭
I've been waiting for RHCP on black summer  🙂👍🏻
QUEEEEE MUSICAAAA DO CARAAII QUEM CONCORDA DA LIKE POHA
Такие дедульки. Но какой же кайф.
How do Anthony and John look like they haven’t aged since the year 2000?
I am about to teach the chords for this song on guitar in a few minutes
Josh fez um trabalho memorável, mas com o Frusciante  o Red Hot é outro nível 😍😍😍😍
Love from Indonesia
Fico muito bom!
what a blessing that these guys are still alive and making music together.
To feliz demais parece que resgataram era de stadium arcadium Californication.. .amo vcs demais since 1996❤🌶
Good song
❤
Does anybody else hear the song that daisy was singing in the hateful 8?
Fantastic. Regards from Brasil !!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
you made a grown man cry
Eu amo red hot chili peppers, e esta música ficou  incrível, como qualquer música vocês. 🎇👏🎇👏🎇👏
I can’t believe johns back!
every single second is perfect!
Wow This really blows .  Crap ! What’s with the pornstache .  Total Sh1t
John’s back.
Will Ferrell killin it on the drums
Eh. I mean it's descent but not anything great. Only reason this track is getting listened to is cause John is back. Otherwise this is a very mediocre song
Ah yep, fuckin ledge. New Album on the way then so 🤫
Any song from The Getaway >>>> this John's comeback was more a marketing thing, they were evolving better with Josh
This song and video are so 1991, in the best way possible.
They were never the same without John. They're back 😤.
Hey Marge, change the channel.🤑🤑🤑🤑
wait till you see them perform it live............WILL BE EVEN BETTER.  There will be 2-3 songs off the new album that gets permanently incorporated into the future set lists.  Just makes the catalogue deeper.
They are the pure expression of love and friendship! El arte en su plenitud!  🎶🌞
🇧🇷❤️
🔥🔥
No me gusta pero tampoco me disgusta, no me dice mucho la verdad
thank god john is back 🥵🥵🥵
Best Chili Peppers song since 2006
As much as I like Josh, it’s damn good to have John back. You can’t replace his guitar work and backing vocals. He makes the whole sound complete. Can’t wait for the album to drop, it’s going to be amazing.
Dead ass, I was like The Punisher has been through some shit lately! lmfaoooo
Wouldn’t of missed this for the world!!!🎵☺️❤️
Al fin nuevamente juntos! Son la banda que me acompaña desde que tengo 12 años, los amo! ❤️
Ooooh this is sooo good on the ear. thanks guys 🙌
They're already old 😢
Simplemente I ❤ RHCP
Love ... Honduras..I love them they are the best

John de nuevo aquí 😢😢
🥰
Simplesmente sublime. Simplemente sublime. Simply sublime. Simplement Sublim. просто великолепно. semplicemente sublime
So fucking beautiful. Glad they are back and ready to tour
Los Red hot chili peppers nunca desepcionan, es simple mente jenial y un placer el disfrutar de su música
QUE BESTIAS!!!
Magic. 🙌🏻
They are back !
I love it
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I cant wait to hear the live solo of JP on this song.
This is just what I needed. What a great song to start my day!! Really really good stuff. Cannot wait to hear the rest of this album.
Still doing it , still making hits, still putting out quality rock , legends 🎶 🤘🏼 🌶
Tem mais brasileiros aqui comentando que gringos

Genial enserio amo mucho su música aunque soy joven .e he escuchado todos sus álbumes
Sounds like a vintage 60's tune, but still kinda boring!
Aaaaamoooooooo
from vietnam with love
🍺🍻🎉🎊🍺🥂🍻🎉🎊🍾🍺
THIS IS RHCP!!! I love it
My heart ❤️ is full. Thank you. The boys back together.
No me esperaba este pedazo de tema.
Han vuelto y me siento muy feliz por un grupo que me influencio tanto cuando tenia 15 años ahora tengo 26 y los sigo amando, gracias por tanta buena música y buen rock
RHCP não envelhece, não decepciona, não faz música ruim e não sai da nossa cabeça.  "Put a Keep Are You" 🤟🏻
Now a guitar that I recognize
Anthony looks like a French dude from the 1800s
“Crack the flaming whip. Sailing on censorship. Riding on a headless horse to make the trip.”
Todavia no entiendo como Anthony puede seguir teniendo la misma voz y energia para cantar
I'm just glad that Keanu Reeves is finally getting the recognition he deserves as a guitarist
We want chili Willy!! We want chili Willy!!
Дедушки )))  🤘😁
Magnifique ❤️🎼🎼🎼🎼❤️
Will Ferrell is such an epic drummer!
Magnificent 4 are back together!
LEEEETS GOOO
Okay..  I've listened to this a few times now in the last 24 hours...  And I believe, after an initial sense of deflation, that it wasn't a new model version of something like 'Stone cold bush', or 'Naked in the rain', it certainly had an intriguing enough merit to cause me to listen. I heard rumours Anthony was speaking Irish. I'm not so sure about that, but I don't dig 'the raccoon hairdo' look personally.  Anyway, back to the music.  The opening is traditional mellow lush, 'oooh, we're there' lullabies of groove the chili's can do so well on occasion, possibly starting from 'Pretty little ditty' on Mother's Milk.  And then it rocks in.. But this is more mellow chili rock than some of their 90's and 00's hard crunching uber grooves.   But that's it, isn't it? We're post the corona blues, and the world has apparently moved on... They are attempting to modernise their vibes in alternate subtle ways.  It's basically Anthony singing about evolution, and platypuses, with his heavy emptiness, as he turns a tad soulful and remorseful for the state of the geopolitical world.  Then comes an interesting, and lengthy, laid back groove from the return of the mighty John Frusciante.  Except, I felt it could have been better? And I felt bad thinking that... But, remember, it was first hearing.  Then, only tonight, on a good system, I realise the latter part is a massive Flea moment...  It's good... For sure.. but is it ultra chili's?  I mean... it's no 'Monarchy of Roses'...  We wait with heaving, exciting, dramatic, baited breath for the return, of the uber funk.  P.S. I would like to remind you that the first time I heard 'Blood sugar sex magic', I didn't like it... but, and this is key, it grew on me, and it became my favourite album for years.
CÊ EH LOKO!!! OS HOMI VOLTARAM COM TUDO 🔥♥️ FRU VOLTOUUU
Ahora puedo morir a gusto. Larga vida a los RHCP 🤟🏼
найс
yo , Im Biased, to me its good no matter what , someone born after 2000 tell me if this is good please
Salute to HOFs RHCPs and Rick Rubin.
Goosebumps
Frusciante is simply addictive... 🤩🤩🤩
Revivió la música cabrones
Can't Stop listening... This was Right on Time! By the Way, it feels like a Parallel Universe to see John back. See you guys on the Otherside on April's 1th!
Peppers with John is always top notch. Very happy to see him back!
I clicked on some pretender garbage that was not this. This is way better than the shit I was listening to. It changed halfway through into a completely different song.
This is divine.
Дождались )
Man they needed jon back. Fuck ya
Brazil is red hot
The Red Hot Chili Peppers, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting for. He's back they're back buy your tickets now
Amazing one love it
Auto tune?
Hey long time no see 😎🛡️ heaven on earth 🌬️🌎👑 is her
My dad was a RHCP fan , he loved these guys and their music. Love you dad , rest easy 🕊🤍.
John John John John!
Cant wait to see these guys live this summer!
Jesus ... this is fucking awesome - greets from Austria
No me cerró tanto musicalmente. Lindo verlo a frusciante. Voy a escucharlo más veces seguidas a ver si se me pega
Edit: it’s starting to grow on me maybe I was being an a-hole…Anthony’s making me wanna hit the gym too  When did Anthony Kiedis turn Irish? Glad this formation is back but this song doesnt have any soul... sadly I think Dark necesseties is a better single and I dont want to
Loving the solo
Que cosa pa linda!
please, don't ever disappear 🔥🔥
Una buena manera de comenzar el año escuchando una nueva cancion de los Red Hot esperemos que sigan sacando mas y que frusciante ya no se vaya.
Anthony sounds great but he is singing in a strange accent. Kind of reminds me of Bert Jansch or something? Not sure. That guitar solo is absolutely exceptional. Some of those tricks are so technically impressive and harmonically diverse but totally full of feel and sincerity. Fru has, somehow, gotten even better at playing the guitar. Baffling. A true hero.
Que felicidad!!!
The gods of funk rock The red Hot chili Pappas are bloody awesome
WELCOME BACK JOHN! Goosebumps to see them at 4 together again

Eu te amo Red Hot Chili Peppers ✳️❤️🇧🇷 Essa música veio em um momento em que estou passando por momentos delicados em minha vida, e veio como um curativo ❤️🌻
Son unos capos culiaooo 🇦🇷🎵🍺🍺🍺los extrañe 😭desde🇦🇷 Tucumán
La rompieron
All the love to Josh and the I'm With You era, but my god it's so good to have John's flow back
I love the way they make music as always 🤗 Anthony's dance too~
It's a jojo's reference ?
👍👍👍

🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 DESDE ARGENTINA BUENOS AIRES, LOS CHILI PEPPERS siempre hacen buena música  recuerdo los años 90 desde abajo de un puente👏👏👏🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷

Decent! Not bad. Not amazing. Safe. I'd give this a six point five out of ten.
Holy shit!  I didn't know Will Ferrel could play the drums so well!
They are back!!!!
Slow cheetah mixed with dani California?
So, there IS hope for 2022...
Ta gueno.😷😷😷😷😷😷😷

Épico 😮
Como é bom ver o john devolta.

Things are back the way they should be.
LET'S FUCKING GO
GRACIAS RCHP!!!!!!❤
Me encanta, ya la he escuchado como 5 veces en media hora
Fascinante Rchp
Mmm...mas de lo mismo. Esperaba mas de Frusciante
Beautiful
Oh soooo good......!
I like the accent he put on this
Great
Ну все, ковид и прочая херня, вы огребаете. Потому что рхчп круче чем мстители и они снова в деле. Перцы спасут мир!!!!!
Se é locomotor..   red hot é muito fodaaaaaa...
Ver o frusciante de volta, e  esse quarteto novamente é emocionante. Adorei a música e o vídeo clipe. Red hot é demais!
Nunca imaginei que fosse ver essa formação novamente tocando uma música nova após tantos anos 😱😱😱 Não tem outro jeito, arrasam demais 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 Long live RHCP 🌶️💥
Fucking killer!!! You guys look awesome super creative man!!!! Love to you guys :) peace
The vocals in this song 🤢 the cadence is so odd and his infliction on some words are just awful.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Los amo
Nunca imaginei que fosse ver essa formação novamente tocando uma música nova após tantos anos 😱😱😱 Não tem outro jeito, arrasam demais 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 Long live RHCP 🌶️💥
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everytime I see that drummer…will ferrell
Now, THIS IS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
Eu tô emocionada, o solo da guitarra, essa vibe, todos juntos
Looking forward to seeing you guys in July, I hope you guys play this song ❤️
PÃO 😎💸
You guys... make my shit day be the best day of this year
I like it but I don't love it. But hey for their age you should respect this guys for keep going! Somehow I think John Frusciante is tricking us and will keep the best songs on this album for last, he did it before ;)
John Frusciante is a monster! :O
This is really good.
I'd love if you make my dream comes true. John and Josh as both guitarists of RHCP.  BTW, nice song.
Nice mullet
Listening to it on repeat! Just too good! THANK YOU RHCP!🌶🤘🌶🤘They make more than songs, what it is they produce is a soundtrack for our everyday life!
Ive been waiting for you
Hacer esto en el momento de mierda que esta pasando la música es increíble.
Trippy video
What a great song. Keep it up chilli peppers.
hope the rest of the album is better than this bs
this is really RHCP vibe. missed John but overall still solid performance and music
Yeeeeaaard
Man, good old days, 2 decades ago, time flies, I tell ya.
RHCP é foda demais, os caras sempre acertam demais 🎸🔥🌶️❤️
Sup wit that Bronson look
Muito bom!!! Brasil!!!
I hope this (John is back and a new RHCP single and LP) means the end of pandemic and the whole world gets back into normality again.
The Frusciante factor is key as important as vocals.
Excelente. Resurgiendo los maestros
Iconic Cali sound.  It's been a long time, RHCP. 🌶️ 🇺🇸
Now I believe I'm in 2022
Anthony sounds a bit like Gordon Lightfoot on the verses.
Finally glad to see this dude's are back together 🤘
Pearl Jam did the same music video 2 years ago, in 2020 with Dance Of The Clairvoyants: with the same Earth images and outerspace soulful landscape, and now the Red Hot Chili Peppers are doing it again in 2022 with Black Summer. It seems like these two rock bands really want to capture the heart and true soul of humanity with their creative visual arts videos and rock music.
Lo más importante es que  No pierden su IDENTIDAD ...🙌 cómo pasó con muchas Bandas
É triste como vamos envelhecendo 😢
Irish accent growing on me a lot
I just started my career in diving and I’ve been listening to a lot of sailing music 🤓
Volvieron a hacer los redhot de antes 😭😭😭😭🤟🏻🤟🏻

Vida longa ao RHCP! O Rock ainda vive! 🇧🇷🤟🏻
Beautiful! Greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽
I love you john
Exelente
RHCP never ceases to amaze me, so glad John joined back!
Sooooo ecstatic that John is back! The band is BEST with him (in my opinion); he elevates them to a Sacredness that is lost when he isn't part of the music!
wo ting
Isn’t awesome that Will Ferrell found time to hit the demons again.  😂🤣 No joke greatest band ever. I go to LA once a year and I have to enjoy the vibes of living amongst the locals on Venice Beach. If not I was never there.
Welcome forever, John.
¡Fascinantes!
This has that timeless RHCP feel. Damn, this rocks.
Anthony Kiedis is doing a karate priest :) Kung-Fu rock n roll soul master
What's up with the Irish accent?
Es Oficial:  Los Red Hot Chili peppers han vuelto
Los extrañé ❤️🦔
English comment coming through 😀 Amazing song!
DISFRUTA Y DEJA DE CRITICAR PELOTUDECES
epic
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, E como esperei o seu retorno Frusciant, esses 4 tem uma magia , em que tudo que envolve música se transforma em algo único e muito marcante, e acredito que essa música não é a melhor do Álbum.
YA esperava esto,que saquen una nueva cancion y que todavia sea con jhon fruciante,el mejor gitarrista,VAMOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS¡
Brasil - #LULA2022
Los mejores red hot vengan otra vez a Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Queremos a los chili peppers  Queremos a los chili peppers Queremos a los chili peppers 🤘🇨🇷
🙏🏽🙌🏼🙏🏽🙌🏼🙏🏽🙌🏼🙏🏽
Love it 🎧🎶❤
Not good
Damn, Joe Exotic is looking ripped.
Yes 🙌🏻
This song is a celebration of those dudes not only just still being alive, but able to still make music like this! 🤟
I didn't know Will Ferrell could play the drums
RHCP tem uma sonoridade marcante e melodias que ninguém tem. Top demais pow
Love the new tune.... Can't wait to see you guys in Charlotte in September ❤❤❤
JF the best!!!!!!!!! 4ever
The boys are back
Californication vives.. sounds good!
Great
💜💜💜💜
Fenway Park baby
So much cooool guys!
ito ung pinoy comment na hinahanap mo hahaha
Te amo John la puta madre cuando por argentina????
Fraudemia NOM
Please keep making music<3
Irish accent?😂🤣
I think this one will grow on me ...
Keeping the essence, good job as usual !! Love you to see you again
Edgar, estás aquí ?
Calling all fans!!! Any old timers willing to share their favorite albums? I’m always up for trying new chili pepper albums, because it’s what I’ve apparently devoted my life too right now, music and, dance, writing, just self expression. I bet there’s others out there like me, because deep down we all are the same!!  I’m 21, and this is the year of expression
Welcome back, John.  I see you brought Anthony an Irish accent.
Not a fan. Shits wack
Incredible <3
Anthony's lyrics are brilliant.  Love this. Took a few listens to fully understand the  poetry and beauty of this piece.   Riddled with double entendres, frustration and fatigue of the state of all the things.  It's riddled with subtleties and nuance with a clever approach.   All open ended for the listener to form their own perceptions of reality.   Oh, and John is back and he's as good as ever.
How does Will Ferrel get the time to act and drum?  what a legend.
Welcome back guys.  This song made me so fucking happy.   I'm ready to rock.  Keep em coming 😜😜
Aêêê! Minha porta de entrada para a música sem a qual eu não vivo \m/ E altas doses de psicodelia visual. Bom demais ver isso hoje \m/
OMG ¡Silverio is the new RHCP singer!
road to 4 million and more v1ews!
Nice... MUCH LUV N SUPPORT ✌️
Good to see Will Ferrell back on drums again
Não tenho palavras. Ouço vocês a 21 anos. Minha primeira música tocada interia no baixo foi otherside. Foi minha descoberta no rock com 16 anos. Sucesso eterno a está banda. Imortalizada no meu coração.
Fact that we can still hear that strat is a blessing
This is the best produced chili peppers video ever, of all time
I read the comments but no one is talking about the song actually…the John’s part is super cool and we are very happy he is back but the chorus is very poor, nothing special at all. So many years for this??🤔 let’s be a bit critical!
Música nada de mais, cansa ouvir.
So I first heard this song this morning. Huge RHCP fan fuck one of my favorite songs is Green Heaven. Listening to this this morning I was not liking the accent or vocals and I felt like it was weak and blah blah blah forced myself to listen to about 10 times because I just had to believe in my boys you know?  Five hours later listening again and god damn this song really is awsome. It’s very atmospheric. Maybe not as aggressive as other material it’s a little more reserved but god damn I can absolutely say the RHCP delivered on this song. It almost reminded me of a band called Rhe Screaming Trees. Love you RHCP  And about the accent. I think Anthony just finds portraying his voice as another character or another persona is interesting. Like how he does it in Skinny Sweaty Man! Or the way when you read a book  (maybe about Irish pirates) you  change your voice to match the character. Just less cartoony. If you think about a shit ton of their music has him doing accents this one is just very direct . And even though that is quirky the songs lyrics and vibe of the song are kind of eerie. China being on the dark side of the moon is pretty real and true.
Esta rolita si suena igual a las clasicas <3
Frusciante en el Olimpo de los dioses de la guitarra
Nem sabia que eles ainda cantava fiquei mo feliz sério e muito bom ver isso
No sé si ya observaron pero Flea el mítica FLEA lleva puesto un cotón estilo mexicano  o poncho mexicano ke chido a regresado la mejor banda del universo los motivos RHCP y con el hijo Prodigo jhon viva los pepers viva México viva la vida ke feliz me siento los esperare con ansias x AKI un un saludo desde México
John tem uma estilo de guitarra diferente, único só de escutar já sabe que é ele. Muito bom o som curti
And to what do we owe this pleasure??... another one for the playlist
Can't wait for you guys to cover Freddie Mercury's song. Such vibes.
i really like how it feel like so simply at first, but while replaying it again you got something that you've missed first time. As single that bring back John in an really RHCP style, and different at the same, good song to me, i cant wait for the full album men!
Same band, Same Vibe! ⭕️
Flea, Chad, Anthony y Jhon Frusciante...que mas se puede pedir?
and just like that they are back :D
Que top!!!! 🇧🇷 O Brasil ama vocês!!!
Excellent tune, I hope the album is as exciting and impactful.
😊😊🥰🥰🥰🥰🤟🤟🤟🤟👏👏👏
Darn, u r awesome, RHCP
This Sucks
Frusciante’s Guitar, The soul of the band!
Can’t wait for the whole album!
Jhon is great, is real, is Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!
Yesss
Grande Will Ferrell en la batería, otro éxito más!
Tiger King is that you?
Welcome back John🖤
Welcome back GOATS
Welcome back, we've missed you
1:52 - 2:32 on repeat.
top demais!
Hacer ese trato con aquel d3monio valió la pena
Ver a estos unidos es como ver a los dioses volver al olympo !!
Dude something's attacking his upper lip
😕 Meh..... it's an ok song, but I had hoped for something that didn't sound like it could have been on By The Way album from 2002.  Oh and what's up with the Irish accent on certain words?
Feliz
Good vibe,.recife 🕺I❤yours
0:55 Will Ferrel drops the beat
Quote me on this: RHCP have never put out bad music!
Asombroso!
CORTOU O BRISA
Great to see Will Ferrell still playing drums
Poético.
This is for you Spiros. My soul mate. My love. May you rest peacefully baby.  I’ll come join you soon enough. I’m bringing snacks and supplies babe! xx
Ficou top demais
Gods.
Love them, they never disappoint, they always do their magic with every new hit
RHCP are still burning HOT! thanks for coming back!
Que regalo ver a John , solo deseo que vuelvan a tocar a Argentina.
Give me like real guys ❤️
3 million is com1ng!
Anthony McKiedis.
This song reminds me so much of their By The Way era, so happy they’re back ❤️🌶
niceeee, john frusciante ❤️
Anthohy Kiedis tá parecendo uma mistura de Justin Long com Danny Trejo kkk
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
GREAT!
Frusciante is the best
RHCP lo mejor ctm 🤙🤙🤙🤙
Why the always replacing one of the guitarist?
this was nice and unexpected and for once i didnt click past a new music video
Los amoo maldita sea los amooo gracias por su música. Por volver!
They’re back, they are all here! God it’s good. RHCP for life.
There back baby!!!😁

Love to see John back! Very disappointed in Chad on this track, though. Hopefully there will be more creative rhythms on the other tracks on the album
🔥🔥🔥
We've aw been waiting  💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

Return of Jedi! Master Frusciante
So good to see John right where he belongs. Waiting on the last train the night of a thousand eyes. Here comes the biggest rogue wave. Okay restocks rabbits dig holes get it??? "All you need is love"

The accent...it's like someone who went to County Cork, had a real good time, then went back to their shitty town but they keep affecting the accent because it reminds them of a time they weren't stocking shelves at Target. This is RHCP for people who watched the video of Under the Bridge and wonder if Anthony is still creaking about at sixty sans shirt...
Con uds sus Eminencias del rock. No pasan los años por uds. Gracias por su música.
Rhcp creates always magic songs, very anxious to see John  live in concerts in Brazil 🇧🇷
anthony looks brutally old
po bom dms ver os comentário cheio de brasileiro, red hot é gigante aqui, tmj rapaziada 🤙
He looks like he's doing a Borat parody ... this " look " just doesn't look good on him , LMAO !
Finally a song that isn't so literal!
💜😎😼😻♥️
Ahh - so nice seeing John back where he belongs
5 años después, por fin el nuevo álbum. C:
Iike this style ❤️❤️😇😇
Grande Diego Verdaguer.... Tanta alegría que desbordabas en el escenario, siempre en nuestros corazones ♥
Fruiscante’s solo is so clean and soulful, I teared up. This New album is going to be great!
We been needing another RHCP album never lets us down
Is a masterpiece. i love it 🤘🤘
Sounds like Stadium Arcadium, OMG!!!!

Para nadie es un secreto que con un disco desplazarían a muchos artistas del top.
johns guitar tones and effects!
Classic John Frusciante. Love it.
Glad to see Will Ferrell back on the drums again!
Anthony com aquelas letras que você só consegue cantar lendo, porque as palavras e frases nunca fazem sentido somente ouvindo kkkkj
00:45This is cool😁
Esto suena bien!
Such an amazing new sound from RHCP! And the timing is quite appropriate!
So good to see John back. Anthony still looks like he’s 40

My life in my eyes 🎧🎶🧘‍♂️
Great! 🇧🇷 04/02/2022
I think its pretty cool that red hot chili peppers got will farrell to play drums for this song, very cool.
It's amazing how the years go by and Anthony's voice remains the same. I love seeing them again Aaaaaa
Uh........
Pure Energy
this song gives me hope
Keanu and Will ferral killed it!
I'm so happy to see you guys again! ❤❤❤❤❤
Always good shit with John!
These guys are amazing, one of my favorite bands for so many years!!!🔥🔥🔥
Frusciante I LOVE YOU ♥️
damn they good
The first two sentences get me every time...
This was way better than dark necessities
John Frusciante!!!
This song has a Jethro Tull vibe to it
Ctm .me desperté hoy alas 5 AM .veo el teléfono y tenía la notificación ♥️♥️♥️♥️ tal vez no sea el mejor tema de los red hot .. pero si está todo ahí . Ese Funk californiano nostálgico esa guitarra de Jhon ese groove de Chad y flea que son uno . Y anthoni que le da ala voz como si estuviera escuchando un tema de los 90 ..sin duda alguna me emocioné ♥️🙌❤️❤️
pop off
❤️
Looks like Tiger King put out a new music video.
🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️ 🎶🎶🎶🎶
Grande red hot chili peppers la mágica guitarra de frusciante inigualable
THEY’RE FUCKING BACK!!!!!!!!!!
Chinas on the derk side of the moon
Not like Coldplay where "oh, we changed the producer, now we're gonna sound totally different" - the RHCP are still the same (btw, also Foo Fighters have kinda lost... or maybe expanded? Their sound in the newest album). Also - proud that the grandfather of the singer - and core of the band - is originally from my neighbouring country - Lithuania. Also - the continuous existence of the band is a proof Me2 doesn't have its "dirty little paws" everywhere. Calm down. Also - this comment is never going to be read - there are 21500 of them in 1 day. Also - greetings from Latvia, stay sharp, RHCP!
I never got to see a new RHCP release with John. This is actual musical history we’re seeing here. One of the best musical lineups reunited after 15 years and sounding like they never even took any time apart
For some reason Anthony's voice in this song sounds like he's some ole' Irish folk singer singing in the back of a pub. Great song though. John's guitar riff sounds awesome as usual. Their reviving back their old Californication and Stadium Arcadium sound on this track thank God. Hopefully the other tracks sound just as good come April 1st.
Pretty good. John really makes a difference in the sound.
You guys still look and sound amazing. ❤️
I actually don't care the peppers, but I love John Frusciante! He is the GOAT.
😭😭😭😭
Magnifico Frunciante con ese Vibrato!
Es lo maximooooooo ❤❤❤❤❤
Me encantan la cancion, los amo demasiado ❤❤❤
obrigado por voltarem... trilha sonora da minha vida. Brasil... well come home Jhon!!!
Som maneirin 🤟🏻🇧🇷
¿Y cuando sacan el album?
RHCP <3 BR
John doesn’t look like he’s aged a day
Buena cancion amigos Black Summer es muy buena cancion y video
I like it😍
John is KING 👑
oh my god i love this so much ❤️🇧🇷
The time to stop was yesterday.
John's delicious guitar tone 😋
Maravilhoso ver o Frusciante de volta.
Man, I really like this.  I shouldn't be surprised. Good stuff
LOS AMOOOOOOO😭💘
This song is like their "Dani California" of the new album. Not the best song on the album....but the 1st song on the album and a killer song to start the journey of the album out!!!
Great and strange song that some moments took me back in time when both RHCP and I were a lot younger, some others made me feel all the time that passed and the nostalgia that remained... Great, great, great
John is back, Will Ferrell on the drums... what a moment to be alive!
This is stadium Arcadium as hell and I absolutely am in love with it.
Los poderoros 4 estan de vuelta!!! Hermosa Cancion 🤟😭💓
Bravo!!!! Thanks so much!
John❤
hermoso, que DIFICIL es encontrar buena música nueva en estos tiempos, con tanta basura sin talento sacando temas tras temas,  que lastima que nuestra ultima esperanza de buena música va a morir con estas bandas. Gracias RHCP !
To quote Flea from the greatest hits liner notes, that John Frusciante sure knows how to put some chords together
No puedo dejar de escucharlo ❤❤❤
Yooooooooo
This guys are Legends
Veary nice Mr. Chili Peppers
Ficou paia
Seeing John back where he belongs is the most beautiful thing in rock in a lomg long time. Been waiting for this since the day he left. So glad he's home. They sound like them again!! Those 4 belong together. I hope they end their careers together and none of them ever leave. John is one of my favorite guitarist, Josh was good, but John belongs with them. All the hard core RHCP fans, like myself are so happy for this. I can guarantee i speak for everyone!
RHCP ESTA BACKASOOO!
This is picking up right after Stadium Arcadium with a pinch of new refreshed Chili’s vibe… it’s great!
I love red hot🤟
omg super cool
Red Hot é uma preciosidade ❤💎🎶🎤🎸
thank you
I'm speechless
¡Tantas veces te pedí una desgraciado, tantas veces!, He vomitado bilis por ti, se me ha caído el pelo por ti, tengo nervios por ti, voy al psiquiatra por ti y hoy, ¡Hoy por fin te apareces maldita sea!   Fueron casi seis años de espera, valió la espera ❤️🔝
Muito foda...que bom quem em meio a tanto kaos y notícias ruins...uma música desta pra acalmar a alma...Obrigado Red Hot Chili Peppers
LOVED IT
Not having John in the band was like a 1000 piece puzzle , with only 999 pieces in total. Welcome Back Chill Willy's
Such a Quality
Very Cool guys
wooooooooooooooooooooooooo John Frusciante estas de vueltaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Anyone hears the Irish/ pirate accent lol? Great song doe and I love to see John back!!!
Nice to see the shanties still going strong
LOS DUROOOOOOS
COVID 19 VACCINE IS NOT A VACCINE!!!
Dude no offense  hot peppers deserve respect....but what has happened to music...this literally  sounds like the last shit they put out...dont get me wrong I am not hating....naw man...naw only thing that actually  stands out in this song....is the lead guitar...hes a beast

Incrível.
es un sueño hecho realidad volver a ver a frusciante en esta mitica banda 🎸❤
Welcome back. Whoever's in the line-up, let's enjoy RHCP while they're still active. Is the song about the pandemic? Or the era without Frusciante? Whatever it is, RHCP is one of the greatest ever. No doubt.
I've been a fan since the 90s
Finalmente música nova e ainda com o john de volta que maximo 😍😍
Un mimo a la nostalgia. Han vuelto ❤️
La mejor banda del mundo a regresado lml
Welcome home John
Bang Boom Bang 🙂
Con frusciante es otra cosa, RHCP!!
un grupo musical que no pasa de moda 👍
Diego Verdaguer no murió, se fue con los Peppers :0
❤️❤️❤️
Ecxelente Vuelve el sonido de frusciante le da un toque único👏🤘
🔥🔥🔥
So good to see RHCP with John Frusciante again! That very best Peppers sound from early 2000s!
Wonder Vibes 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
IM COMING FOR FLEA BASS AND RHCP
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa meu coração não tava preparado mano
Why the fuck is so many brazilians here?
Como sempre uma obra de arte perfeita aos ouvidos, estou escutando ela o dia todo e pelo visto estou distante de parar kkkkkkk
This is good. In so many ways, this is good.
Who are the neo from matrix on guitar?
I think it's gonna grow on me ✌🏼
Cause of this fcking mustache i though its new hypa hypa remix
Same groove new lyrics ...perpers spicyness still packing a punch ...John killed as always 🤘❤🇨🇦
Anthony kept his "shirt" on for a fully 1 minute 30 seconds. That's a new world's record.
My favorite song from the Chili's!  ❤
Simply, thanks guys 🖤🌶️
¡Por fin volviste Frusciante, el rock te necesitaba!
The consumate showman, the funky-drummer drumming, the surreal sounds of the guitar, and the glue that holds it all together. Still miss Hillel...
ZzzzzzzzZzz
Welcome back Frusciante, missed you my boy.
LOVE THIS, WELCOME BACK JOHN!
I know they are good, but it's the first time they impressed me with a song.
Si señor
Eu estou feliz!
New Song... Old Drum Beat :P
It's decent but I expected something a little more upbeat and funky for a first single... But beggars can't be choosers just glad there together again! Maybe I'll be able to finally get to see them live!
Chili’s be pepper-in’
Son: "Dad, your music is pretty cool" Dad: "Yes Son, it is sounding more and more like Grandpa's classic rock music."
THIS is the sound, I've been missing so much for so long! ❤️❤️❤️
Temazoooooooooo
This is awesome. Frusciante kills it again
É um privilégio poder assistir a volta do Frusciante! Vida longa RHCP!
CARACAAAAAA, ARREGAÇOOOOOOOU 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
damn I miss frusciante's riffing, this is beyond awesome a lot of memories flooding in been a fan for fucking 30 years since blood sugar sex and magik, really... it been a really long time waiting...
Heroin is one hell of a drug
LENDAS! Maior banda do MUNDO

Desde Uruguay 🇺🇾♥️ al fin un buen acontecimiento en estos momentos, gracias RHCP!
Que saudade de ver e ouvir o bom e velho Frusciante !!!
Que maravilha de som!!! Vida longa ao RHCP!!! Um salve do Brasil!!! Energia fantástica desse grupo!!!
“I’ve been waitin, I’ve been waitin, waitin on another Peppers album againnn”
It sounds like Californication and Stadium Arcadium all at once! Familiar Feeling😭
This is who you guys were supposed to be from the start.
Que bien que me hace que sigan haciendo su música, exelente video también.
I have missed the chemistry of Anthony and John...I'm so glad to hear this song...and am looking forward to seeing them in August.
Chad Smith may be the least egotistical drummer in rock today. Only ever playing whats needed to move the song along & not a pointless fill in sight🥁
Ohhh noooo.   Listen guys…… go back to the ricks mansion and lock yourselves back in there until Blood Sugar Sex Magic 2 comes out
As a sailor, I will always love sea and I will always love you…
Akhirnya kalian rilis album baru, terima kasih ya, kalian hebat!
Anthony, John, Flea and Chad: THANK YOU THANK YOU for the work of art you do. I'm a blessed to have the chance again to listen to y'all's back together. Your music is incredible, your attitude is incredible...it's just magic. Can't wait to listen the rest of the album! I've this song played all day long!! Long live to the RHCP!! JOHN YOU ARE THE GOD OF THE GUITAR YOU ARE FREAKING AWESOME!!! LOVE YOU ALL GUYS!!!
THEY'RE BACK
Belleza de canción, amo a los  RHCP
Sorry , long time fan , don't like this one ...
This song is absolutely the best combination of tell me baby and don’t forget me I could ever imagine
perfeito apenas aaaaaa
I was looking forward to hear your music again.
Just the band it's self..... With the background of scenery is amazing.
🥰🥰🥰🥰😍 fofos
What a blessing to hear from these 4 guys again! The world needs some chili peps right now...
I'm so old. I'm watching my dad play rock n' roll
Coração não aguenta de felicidade! Obrigada RHCP… lança esse disco logo pelo amor 🤣🤣🤣
uauuu
My favorite group ♥️
Viva Frusciante!!! Larga y bella vida a los Red Hot🌶🌶🌶🌶 ES bueno y bello ver de vuelta a un gran señor y maesro de la guitarra!!!
John was awesome, as always.

GOOD ENOUGH.
Haven't listened to RHCP for some time now, but I am loving this song. Nice to see them again, oh and Anthony... nice moustache mate!
What's with the stupid accent?
Do it again without Autotune fellas!
#REDChad, #HOTKiedis, #CHILLIFlea and flavor #PEPPERSFrusciante ✨💫🎸🎤🎶🔝
♥_♥
🌱🔥
I prefer my Black Summer to be Dirty
Really great!
Frusciante back baby.
RHCP if not the best band, they have to be the greatest.
Fuck yeah!!!
Britty different  from  them..like it
Will Farrell is awesome on drums
What do you think this song is about ?
This is by far the best day of the year!!! Anthony, Flea, Chad and John are back baby!!!!!!!!!!! Literally put this song on repeat the last 24 hours. I loved Josh, but I did miss all those Froosh solos. Tears of joy all day! :D
ERA O QUE MEU ANO PRECISAVA PRA COMECAR BEM 💚
los quiero cabros
I've been seeing Anthony Kiedis shirtless more times than my wife in many years.
Wow pedazo de canción...!!!
ยิงแก่ยิ่งเฟี้ยว
:p
Larga vida RHCP, VIVA LA DESISTENCIA <3
Esse dia é com certeza um momento histórico para nós, fãs dessa banda maravilhosa que marcou infância de muitos
this is kinda refreshing... did they film this in _the volume_ ?
Heard it's gonna be a double album
Pow , muito boa .
❤❤🇧🇷
Los Red Hot Chili Peppers deberían ser eternos. ❤ A Anthony Kiedis ya se le marcan las arrugas, ¿quién podría encontrarlas en el rostro del muchachón de cabello largo y brillante que corría hacia la cámara en Under The Bridge? Igual, a pesar de los años no deja video sin descamisarse, y yo también lo haría, si a los 60 años tuviera ese cuerpazo. Flea nunca ha dejado de lucir viejo, pero la energía que tiene para martillar el bajo la envidiaría cualquier centennial. ¡Volvió Jhon Frusciante! con sus camisas leñadoras, el cabello despreocupado y la fiel Stratocaster, roída y sabia, con riffs que recuerdan al Electric Ladyland de Jimi Hendrix. Y el viejo Chad Smith, prudente, silencioso y distante, como salido de un cuento de Raymond Carver, lo celebra todo desde el trono de su batería. Sus letras no son profundas, hay que reconocerlo: "The night is dressed like noon / A sailor spoke too soon / And China's on the dark side of the moon". Pero, estos californianos, los meros meros, no le cantan a este Jerson que cree que se las sabe todas. Le cantan al Jerson adolescente que ponía todo el día el televisor en Play TV para escuchar By The Way y sentir que esa canción ya me la sabía, que la había escuchado antes, que los Red Hot Chili Peppers decían algo como por debajo del agua y que yo podía entender. Dice Leila Guerriero: "Y de pronto entendí: no quiero avanzar, quiero retroceder. Volver al momento en que hacía las cosas sin saber cómo se hacían."
The drought and lack of rainfall here on the West Coast and the countless wildfires blackening sky and cremating our resources. The isolation of the last two years the inability to meet new friends. All of this so poetically written into these beautiful lyrics, and music and instrumentals that forces you to fill every word in your soul. The Red Hot chili peppers never fail to succeed in their music. Much love from the Pacific Northwest, lifelong rhcp fan from your first album to the present and as far in the future as you guys go. Thank you for once again creating a song for the time and for the ages
YESSSS!!!!!!
Holy shit, Joe Exotic is out of prison.
Vaya, no me lo esperaba en verdad es bastante fresco, es un excelente trabajo no es lo más memorable del mundo pero es un excelente prospecto
🎚️🎼🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎯🎯🎯 So gut!!
It’s cool that John is back but Anthony sounds like shit and it’s sounds like poorly done auto-tune also
I don't know.....maybe it'll grow on me.
What a pleasant surprise
Man, Will Farrell is so talented
Imagina essa música ao vivo, a energia ressurgindo!
Love this!
me encanta ver a los red hot juntos nuevamente empieza este 2022 con este terrible hit
Like every chili peppers song before it, it's okay.
Great
John sounds awesome. The guitar is by far the best thing about it. Don't know how I feel about the rest though.
Anthony Kiedis looks like Eddie Guerrero now.
I am actually pretty damn impressed lol❤️
THATS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR🌶️🌶️🌶️
So so so goodddd really awesome to see John back he’s guitar tone is out of this world❤️❤️
estoy llorando
That guitar's riffs and this bass lines are life.
Frusciante 🤗🤗🤗
WELLCOME BACK!!!!!!!!!
The way RHCP speaks to me makes me feel 🌻🌍🌳🌊🫀
Greatness
Love u guys!
It's almost as if there weren't those albums without John after Stadium Arcadium. They just picked up where they left off there. I love SA, so that's great for me!
simplemente hermoso
"vamos fazer um clipe"  Anthony: *tirando a camisa*
every time i listen to RHCP i'm reminded how great flea and john frusciante are ........and how much I fucking hate Anthony Kiedis, he is easily the most overrated singer of all time and his lyrics are complete dogshit.
I didn't hear the word California.
Mais  do mesmo, adoro o som dos  cara só música boa .red hot Forever.
RHCP is just fantastic!🙆‍♂️ Anthony will never get old.
This song is so RHCP, like a 15 year later addition to Calfiornication
Que John tan Josh...mehhh
Amazing. Life is always better when these 4 are putting out hits. Thank you. Shedding tears rn
This song came on while I was in the shower...I literally thought it was wierd Al yancovich. Time to hang it up boys.💯💯💯
My heroes
I'm watching this clip all the time
I love you John!!!!
Vamoooo los chili!!! Que bueno!!
So glad they are back! And Will Ferrel is such a talented drummer 🥁
Vocês são incríveis minha inspiração pra música🤘
perfect clip
it's so beautiful to see them together
Ahhh the Anthony Kiedis Style Mullet in all it's glory!
Great song! John sounds beautiful...... I'm so happy he's back.
💪🏻💥
I wish I could cruise to this right now with the windows down. As it is, I am freaking cold and in Atlanta.
PUTA QUE PARIU EU TO VIVO PRA VER ISSO
Возвращение легенды.  The legend is back!
Esse tem cheiro de perfume bom, daqueles que não saem tão fácil 👌
Oh my god this song make me chills .My native language is not English so for the first I've heard this I searched the lyrics because in a song if you don't understand the lyrics it's nothing. What can I say , this song talks about the climate change that is one of the reason for the extinction of many animals but also the title "black summer " remind me the smoke of a forest fire.  The album is called "unlimited love" maybe in this track is love for animals and nature. (I'm sorry for my English ) I love this beautiful guys ❤️ From an Italian fan , ROCK OUT MOTHERFUCKERS !!!
Braba
*The Only English Comment Your Looking For.*
Now this sounds like the Chilli Peppers!Not sure why Anthony is doing an irish like accent..lol but I dig!
NUNCA DEJES DE VOLVER JUAN !!
Black sun, global warming, China, triangles and all the occultists symbols.
Rhcp é foda. John é foda. Esse é o verdadeiro  Red hot Chile Peppers.
Frusciante and his guitar, wow, just wow.
Mark 8:36- “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Anyone that does not make sure they have taken care of their soul will end up destroyed. Your soul is the part of you that is eternal. It is tragic when a person dies and is not sure of where they will spend eternity.
Yawn.....
“I'm forever near a stereo saying, 'What the fuck is this garbage? ' And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers." - Nick Cave
Seems it's too soon for the lyrics guy!
John F is amazing. I was really missing these 4 together. I'll see you in LA in July
Just so Bloody Good ....
# Black Summer
I feel like despite all the craziness we’ve ALL been through the past couple of years WE have all seen awesome things happen too like RHCP’s new album, Matrix 4, Mortal Kombat, Super bowl, and wait, there’s more!…

I fucking LOVE the Chilie Peppers!! This is fucking AWESOME!!
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”  4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.  9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
Uooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwww!!!
Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers, 🙌

China on the DSOTM
I am Gen Z but I really love Red Hot Chili Peppers so much because of their music style and burning lyrics and many more..they're a perfect band! 🔥
I'm a big fan of the band, but this sound is too weird for me. I did not like it..
Fantastic to hear new music from ALL the boys again! Looking forward to hearing the rest of the album! Anthony looks more like his dad with each passing year
Красавцы!
OMG :0 Las leyendas de regreso :3
Aguante los Chili ¡ 🙌🇦🇷
Honestly this sounds old, not classic just old… Maybe if this was released 10yrs ago  I would be impressed, maybe?  As of now I am underwhelmed  The build up to this release Is similar to a premature ejaculation.  I will  definitely be listening again !
Ficou do caralho, Frusciante faz muita diferença

Ese sonido de Frusciante, dioooooos
Imagina esse som ao vivo vai ser uma feeling diferenciada salve Peppers pra Sempre!!! Brasil ama vcs!! Minas Gerais!!!

They seem to have chemistry with the new guitar player. Welcome back John, we missed you
It's like getting back together with your girlfriend after not seeing her for 15 fucking years
selalu jatuh cinta dengan lagu nya RHCP⚡🪐
John's solo gave an eargasm
O clipe tá estilo Molejão mas a música é muito boa
Loving the new Peppers song.  Incredible!
Señores, hoy nació la música. 🧐🍷
Pena não ser possível ter John e Josh juntos...  Vida longa RHCP. Vocês fazem parte da minha historia. Lembro de momentos importantes dela com musicas do RHCP no fundo!
Frusciante must be one of the most beloved musician in the history. So much love for him. It’s so great to see him performing with peppers once again!
🇲🇦✌🏻
[Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now) [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Guitarra de John é inconfundível 👏👏👏
Its been a long time.. What a great comeback~
😍🥰
Thanks johnny for these axis bold as love vibes
God damnit I hate the vocals
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums!!
Honestly, Frusciante is the only highlight in this RHCP iteration. A very talented bunch of individuals in a very uninspired stint in their career.
Lá vai escutar novamente
SEÑORES.....  EL DÍA DE HOY !!!EL ROCK VOLVIO A NACER!!!  #VivaRHCP🌶🔥❤️
IT’S SHOCKING HOW MUCH BETTER JOHN MAKES THIS BAND. SO GOOD TO SEE THEM ALL PERFORM TOGETHER
amo esta canción
John Frusciante!☹️
🌶️🌶️🌶️
🤘🤘🤘
Que orgulho encontrar varios brasucas nos comentários, aqui no Goiás, pelo menos a parte que moro, quase não curtem rock, orgulho de dizer que rhcp foi a banda que me fez conhecer o rock e me apaixonar pelo gênero
EU SIMPLESMENTE NÃO CONSIGO PARAR DE OUVIR ESSA MÚSICA. ESTOU HÁ 14H OUVINDO DIRETO. MEU DEUUUUUS EU TE AMO FRUSCIANTE ❤❤❤❤❤
john!!!!!woooaahhhh
C´mon!😎
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Can't believe John is back, it's so freaking awesome to see them together again. Song sounds delightful, can't wait to listening to the rest of the album!
Me encanta como canta, me hace relajarme bien cañon por siempre chilli pepers
They are still out here making 🔥
Los amo mucho ❤
Is that Will Ferrel on drums?
Maravilhosa. !
Não envelhece nunca.
VERY NICE SOLO AND CLASSIC JOHN´S "ROTARY" SOUND
The beginning of the song is reminiscent of Under The Bridge and this is actually great. At the same time, the development of the theme, although predictable, is somehow new. Amazingly!!! Great!!!  Visually - perfect! Bravo!
Yes!!!
Как удачно на youtube зашла 🖤🖤🖤
Nice video, you guys look great at 60ish. Magic fingers is back. Bless you.
MANO!! Fantástico !
Que sonzinho mixuruca. Para quem é fã do Red Hot original com álbuns como The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Mother's Milk, Freaky Styley, esse sonzinho da vergonha. Sem peso, sem impacto. Uma pena, mas sem dúvida nenhuma que é o som que vende hoje em dia pra essa galera entorpecida e sem conteúdo.
This sucks after blood sugar sex magic they changed .
anything happens: Anthony and Flea: *takes off the shirt
i think this is a jam song for their concert
yessir! ❤️
GRANDIOSO!!!
Frusciante não saia mais do RHCP . Que saudades 💟
Eddie Guerrero
Anthony sempre com visual diferente loucão  Jonh frusciante parecendo o Keanu Reeves  O flea só balançando a careca como sempre doidão  E o batera como sempre só curtindo a vibe de boassa
Охуенно!!!
I hope you come again to Brazil, real soon! =)
Father time spares no one, maybe except for Tom Brady.  These guys look so old compared to when they were on the MV Californiacation.
Definetely on the Pop Music side. Really enjoyed the Lyrics with a Hint of Native Indian influence Kiedis such a Great Composer. This band is the Real Deal as always. Good to see JF and Flea Rock out. Chad is the Center of this band.  Whos Going?
WILL FERRELL!!!!
Frusciante is right back home. Anthony hasn't aged a day.
Welcome back John! Melt our faces.
Desde Perú🇵🇪🇵🇪, deseando que algún día regresen, ésta vez no me pierdo su concierto por nada, ojalá pasé. LARGA VIDA A LOS CHILI PEPPERS 💛♥️🖤♥️🖤♥️🖤💛
Yup this is RHCP.
#EndThePornStache
VIDA LONGA AOS CHILI PEPPERS 💪🏽👏🏽
Amazing! The bassline and the guitar solo are fucking great!!
GOD DAMN Fueshante has still got it almost like he never left... not that Josh wasn't also amazing but cmon you gotta admit that classic chili pepper sound is back and I can't wait to hear the new album!!!
WOW....
Unidos e sem limites. Viva o RHCP <3
XD it was indeeed legend ... arY
Recorded in “Pedra Preta” know as Black Stone, in Barbacena, Brazil
Escuchar la voz de Kiedis, el bajo de Flea, la batería de Smith y las cuerdas de Frusciante nuevamente es hermoso
Parece un sueño volver a verlos juntos 😃, ojalá no despierte
I was so hungry for RHCP that they could have played a cover of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and I'd be "God Damn, John is in top form, Anthony still can't sing but I don't care I love his voice and lyrics, Flea rocks, and Chad playing strong as always".  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Get tattoo. Repeat.
Joooooooohnnnnnnn!
Nice poncho flea¡¡¡ 🇲🇽🌮¡¡
Aaahhh qué épico c:
This is amazing
Finally they're back together!!! ❤️
컴백 인가요 스타디움 아카디움 느낌으로
When did they get the original line up back I been out of the loop
Great Song!!! 😎🤘
That is one brilliant production . . .
Simplesmente DO CARALHO!!!
I like this
Wow literalmente cambiaron mi día RHCP gracias totales, Costa Rica los espera
Frusciante is baaaaaaack 😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤
Agora imagina esse solo ao vivooooooo vixiiiiii
Muchas Gracias por su musicaaa RHCP!!!!!!!
EEEEEEEEEEEE????
volvieron los RHCP
I’m kind of disappointed. Aside from John’s guitar work, Anthony’s lyrics and vocals feel like a parody of the band itself. I kinda wished they went further into the textures and alternative rock-isms made by Josh’s albums but this time with John’s signature guitar, but instead they decided to appeal to  Stadium Arcadium nostalgia.  If this is the “single” then I’m afraid to say this should never have happened.
INCRÍVEL AMO VOCÊS 💚💛💚💛
Are any of the comments in English?
what a great fuzz tone, one of the best for sure
Горячее солнце, горячий песок Горячие губы — воды бы глоток В горячей пустыне не видно следа Скажи, караванщик: "Когда же вода?"   Учкудук три колодца Защити, защити нас от солнца Ты в пустыне - спасительный круг Учкудук.................))
Damn awesome song!
Woa llorar :')
Anthony Keidis keeps the body of a Greek god through 30 years of drug use and hedonistic shit and still has the body of an mma fighter in his 50s...what's your secret
stadium arcadium vibes is hereee
Finalmente weon
Show use how is done
Gooder Stuff.
Idolaku sudah terlihat tua sekarang😌
quanto br, legal
I love the Peppers but this kinda sounds like a Stadium Arcadium revival.
Fabulous ❤
https://youtu.be/KzEI1sn_wS0
Thanks Anthony
muito boom
3M HERE WE GOOO
Espectacular canción, nunca pierden su esencia 🤘🤘🤘
I expected something far better but at least Frusciante is back
No matter how old you are, you are still amazing
Te quiero mucho Frusciante! 🙌🤟😝
Gözbebeğimiz hoşgeldi.
Rick n roll
temazo, long live rhcp 🌶🔥
Amo muito, parabéns pelo incrível trabalho da banda ❤🙏
sounds like all their other music, all this time and still stuck in their comfort zone, too bad
These guys have still got it!!!! 🙌🏼 x
RUSSIAN REACTION https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfkOI3kNLEI&t=13s
The vocals really let this song down
Will Ferrell looking good as ever..just kidding. I'm 46 been listening since sixth grade.
another great guitar solo ruined by a shitty song... oh well
Um excelente trabalho pessoal!!!!
Gracias por venir a salvar el 2022
Demasiado Genial y hermoso ❤️, me encantan!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I needed this in my life...  This makes me happy... ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seja bem vindo mestre frusciante, você fez falta
Hi, I’m crying 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Vengan a Latinoamerica, por favoooooooor! <3
These 4 together are special. Hoping that they pull yet another rabbit out of the hat on this album.
The four dude are back.. RHCP
Can someone tell me better(active) band right now ?
Que temon!  Oe vengan a Chile 🇨🇱 . Ya salí de mis deudas
Frusciante está de vuelta, tanta nostalgia los red hot están de regreso :')
Fuckyeah♾
Lo lograron una vez más..!!! 👏👏👏🔴🔥🌶️
Frusciante effect.
John Fruciante 🐐🐐🐐🐐
I love this band so much I wish California was real
When did Will Ferrell join as a drummer?
A resounding “meh” for me on this one.
Classic RHCP!!
Ta top
Anthony's voice sounds different here
Trending
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What’s that weird accent Anthony is doing ?
great good guitar sound all perfect
The band is finally back! John was the missing piece .
I really like it.  Not sure what's all the talk about Anthony singing like a pirate... what??
Vivi pra ver essa obra de arte 🥺
Hoje eu voutei no ônibus escutando Red hot na verdade quase todos os dias 😁🤟🏽
John 😍
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
They can do no wrong in my book. Red hots rule forever
LENDAS SEMPRE ATIVAS
Great to see new music from them and having John back in the band is icing on the cake. Definitely one of my all time favorite axe men.  I feel bad for Josh. It did more than an admirable job fling in for John.  But this is the quintessential Peppers lineup.
I think Anthony looks good in that Zappa mustache 👍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yikes, serious vibe of "creep next door with a hot-tub who keeps hitting your wife even though she's younger than his daughter"... also not a fan of the autotune
Buena. Como se nota cuando vuelve frusciante a la banda
This is RHCP!!!!
Brazil
LETS GO
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
va a ser un disco doble o un disco simple, por que lei que iban a ser 17 canciones
can we make this #1 on charts before the album even releases!!!!!! do it for john!!!!! do it for the peppers!!!
Genios de mi alma!!gracias!
This is just wow their sound hasn't changed at all it's still amazing
I have been waiting so long for John to return and was not disappointed! The riff is pure magic from his soul, Anthony always seems to find these unusual lyrics that just fit, Flea is one the best bass players and Chad's drumming is powerful yet able to change up in a song to fit it's style and emotion!
Topppp
Frusciante ha vuelto. Que sonido! Emoción!!
Gracias Rhcp!!!!!!!!!!!!
They actually got Will Ferrel to play the drums!!!
The BEST RED HOT #FAMÍLIAMESQUITARAP
Good to see you boiz bringinit again! Beeeoot!
RHCP are back and it’s a damn good day to be alive… Portugal is here for you! 🇵🇹🖤🌶
Fuzzy sounds ❤️
OS AMO
Will Ferrell is great on drums lol! 😜🤣🤣 Glad to see these guys back at again! 💯💯💯❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pimenta na veiaaa !!!! 🤘
👤
Los amo con todo mi ser
Beautiful
Music saves
Frusciante se mandó un solo, con solo eso vale la pena la canción.
He seems to go into an Irish accent a couple of times during the song.
Musica boa d -_-b
RHCP THE BEST BAND EVER!
Gotta love Josh for his commitment, but Frusciante is the man ❤️🎸 so glad to see him back, waiting to see you guys back at Rock In Rio! The legends reunited!
Welcome back, *John Frusciante*
Awbo 🤘🏽
Anthony is slowly becoming Iggy Pop
why are will ferrell and keanu reaves in RHCP now??!!?!?!
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16  God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him. John 3:17
They could've used josh, the recording has 2 guitars...
No shade thrown to Josh, but it just feels like when John comes back, the energy of the band is revived. I can’t wait for this album!
Never thought I would see Frusciante back with the rhcp. This is special! Legends🤘
histórico
Josh… :(((
musica fraca esperava mais  . com volta do frusciante.
So good!!!
Gostei
Glad to see will Ferrell still kicking it
This is probably the best song I've listened to all day
stand on your throne john
Meeu deeus
Good vibes again 😌 ✨
Gracias!
Gracias
Frusciante is baaaaack!!!!!♥️♥️♥️🎸
GOD IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
Will Ferrell is killing it on drums.
Nothing wrong with this.
Aqui estou. Amo RHCP. Lembro de ter escutado Californication por volta de 2016, desde lá, nunca parei de escutá-la. A partir de 2020, comecei a escutar a discografia da banda, não me arrependo! 😎
É disso q eu tô falando pohaaaa!! Q sdd cara🤘🏻🤘🏻
John is the only Dracula here.
Hmm, idk what to think.
🇫🇷🤘🌶
genios!!!!!💯🙌🏻
Another frusciante masterpiece. It’s been too long!
RHCP is back! 🇧🇷
Легендарная группа выпустила видосик! Песня шикарная.
https://youtu.be/lXS7chyX9eM
Suenan como igual suenan como cuando era un adolescente
Спасибо автору случайно увидел  в Google и просто получил удавольствие!!!!!!!
gokil 👏👏👏
Damn!! They’re good.
My favourite song from them since Stadium Arcadium it’s absolutely beautiful!      Classic melodies from Frusiante, bass licks from Flea, lyrics and vocals are killer from too from Antony Kiedis, so fire !!!!  🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Muy buen temazo!!!! 👍 aguanten los R.H.C.P saludos!!! 🇦🇷
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Great to see John back again. Don't ever let him go again :)
Ojalá y se retiraran dignamente. Lástima era muy esperado y oigo más de lo mismo. Ni modo si fueron buenos pero la evolución no se nota.
Frusciante is back... and it feels!!!🤟
Mr Frusciante 🎸
Estou muito feliz, que momento de nostalgia incrível. Ótimo ver john de volta gravando.
I’m a huge RHCP fan, but this sounds recycled from Californication and scar tissue.  😐
You four, please never stop playing music together! My heart is filled with gratitude, Anthony, your voice is a balm for a shattered soul! Thank you very much! Stay with us, your art is more valuable than anything! With lots of love and friendly hugs from Hungary❤❤❤❤
I see a change. Not bad but a change. I imagine being a band member and enduring the career and all I can say to myself is what a life man, what a life.
missed so much frusciante's iconic guitar playing with the RHCP
🙌🎸🇧🇷
Fuck yeah fellas.
A salvar la música!!!
Naaa, escucharlos con esos sonidos frescos aún es TODO. ¡Larga vida a RHCP!
This really seems like a mix that it could be on By The Way and Stadium Arcadium. The chorus gave me big vibes of Midnight's chorus on By The Way. CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACKKKKK
It's aight. 😎
O show deles deve ser top demais!!
Boooooaaaa! 🇧🇷
Verlos juntos de nuevo llena de vida a mi corazón.  Hay que creer siempre! 😍☝🏻☝🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Lo hicieron de nuevo 🌶️💯🔥 Larga vida a los RHCP... Los invito a ver un video que realice en honor a ésta gran banda y a su canción Under the Bridge 🌉 🌶️ 🔥 https://youtu.be/sEr662yU1z4
Eu tô vendo esse clipe o dia todo e ainda não acredito no que tô vendo, muito bom!!!
Why he look like Joe Exotic
I hate the fact anthony looks like a version of hitler. He was adorable with long hair and no mustache
The Rolling Stones.. Iron Maiden...  RHCP
Fire Chad
💓
❤️
I love you guys so much, keep making music, there will never be a group like the Red Hot. You fill the world with hope.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Pure Love, RHCP 4 EVER <3
Tá mais RED HOT do que nunca
Eles voltaram  com tudo
I know I had months to prepare but I hear that guitar and I'm tearing up anyway. John Frusciante, welcome home!
Did ya'll hear that new Red Hot Chili Peppers bop?
<33333333333
Now that Frusciante is back, squeeze RHCP. Squeeze hard...
Mullet Kiedis
siempre con buenas canciones, no me canso de escucharlos
Los sigo desde cemento!!
GREAT OCCULT DATE TO REALEASE IT
Se parar pra pensar, estamos em um universo em que John sobreviveu à heroína, voltou à banda em 1998, saiu em 2009 e voltou em 2019... Qual a chance de ter todo esse legado dele?? Eu me sinto mega sortuda por estar vivendo nessa que parece uma rara realidade alternativa. Desde que ele voltou em 2019, nada mais parece impossível 🧡
Wow frusciante is the piece of the puzzle. I love them no matter what. But I dont get into hard unless my hero is on the Axe!
I will miss Josh...
Jesus came back !!!
Do more music like this its epic!
necesito ese album!
🙏🏻  👍🏻
FRUSCIANTE FRUSCIANTE I love it soo much
Real GODS!!!!!
I didn't know they still made music right on!!
Que temazo......
Legends lives on
maravilha!!!!
This song is mixed really well. Sounds great.
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
I had the honor of seeing RHCP years ago, the greatest concert of my life! Beyond words! Waiting for new music has been so hard, but we needed new RHCP music now more than ever. This brings a tear for sure. It is awesome! I am SO glad John is back, baby!!  Welcome back boys...we missed ya! <3
We only keep getting black summers because you people keep voting for them.
Muy buen tema👏👏🎶
Anthony está mamadisimo :O   Uuuuuuufffffffffffffff empezamos bien el 2022 genteeeee esto es épico
One day there will be no new rhcp songs. That day is not today.
tiger king is that you? 😅
Viva o rock poah 🤘
.
FIRST RHCP FRUSCIANTE SONG IN 16 YEARS!!
ORO
Flea with that paintbrush right as John starts his epic solo momemt like "Hey everyone watch this great artist John paint another beautiful solo before you."
Volvieron los míticos coros de John Frusciante ♫ Vamos los Red Hot desde Argentina.
😍😍🔥
These are some of best lyrics Anthony has ever written.
Great tune !!!🤘🤘🤘 Thanks dudes for making such great music!!! Since I was a boy enjoying their music !!!
que extraño escuchar a los rhcp con sonido estereo
Yeah no
Will Farrell is killing that shit on the drums
gonna be honest lads, bit fucking boring actually. thought they would have come back with something more hard hitting. maybe they all need to get back on the old cocaine and heroin again.
Durrrrrrrk soiiiid of the mewnnnnnnn
This made my Friday 😁
Frusciante faz toda a diferença na banda. Incrível como as músicas têm outra energia, outra cara quando é ele quem toca. A formação do Red Hot é essa. Muito foda.
The chorus and solo of John Frusciante are back. Since now, the world is a little better
Ahhhhh muriendo de felicidades en 3...2..1.. 🌶♥️
Lo más esperado de estos últimos años, gracias RHCP.
Classic lineups are magical. This is one of them. Respect their talents and collaborations w other musicians. Nothing compares to this lineup.
RHCP are back ❤️
He looks like a skinny Danny Trejo in this video 🤣🤣🤣
Amém
For a dude who is turning 60 years old this year, Anthony looks great.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🤘🏿💪
God they suck now
Best band in the world is back together and their about to take over the world...get on and ride the wave 🌊
sim, sou você no passado
Don't like this tune but I am sure others will be great!!
感動🥺
Hard to believe these dudes haveï been doin this for over 30 years and they still got it! Great song
Buy dogecoin
Well if that wasn’t as esoteric as it gets I’ll be fucked.
Smooth as always…love you guys!
Damnn!! 🔥🔥🔥😭🔥🔥
1:52 - 2:32 is pure EXTASY!!
Guess who's back.😏 Back again. 😉 (Eminem voice)
Getting some Stadium Arcadium vibes from this. So good to see and hear John back on the guitar.
❤❤❤❤
RHCP é uma banda muito forte porque seus integrantes e suas personalidades são muito marcantes. Além do talento musical dos quatro juntos, é óbvio. Red Hot não existe sem qualquer um dos quatro...  E gratidão tambem ao Josh que segurou as pontas por 10 anos, não deixando a banda morrer. Se não fosse ele, pode ser que nunca veríamos o retorno do John...
boa musica
Welcome home John
Los amo ♥
I can only imagine the pressure on the band, and/or on Frusciante, when they put the album together. Coming back after 10 or 15 years... And let's be frank, the chemistry between the four guys... That's called Red Hot Chili Peppers. "Unlimited Love". Probably the most lame title of all time. But the music. Sounds like the direct sequel to "Stadium Arcadium". The vibe. The vocal sounds the same, the drums hit the same, as it was 15-20 years ago. The album's tracklist, and probably the length (approx. 1 hour) are also the good old routine. Not mentioning the name of Rubin. And "Black Summer" is only 6% of the whole. Can't wait to 1st of April. :)
that tone is singular. its just so awesome to hear.
Its been a long time since... Welcome back John, welcome back guys. ❤ 🌶
These vocals suck
Chili gringos muy bien! Jejeje!!
Rock music!
This sounds like RHCP covering Jethro Tull
Esto si es influencia pura y sanó  !papá¡
I love red hot ❤️
Stare, super Red Hot. Super brzmienie. 😎😎😎👊👊👊👏👏👏
зачем солист косплеит Мачете?
Enfim o retorno com a melhor formação.
Great song, but what is the deal with  Anthony's strange accent/pronunciations?
❤️
So great to hear how relevant the RHCPs still are. GREAT SONG! Nice to see and hear Frusciante again.
They've really aged a lot but their music still feels like 20years ago, it brings me back to my teenage and college days
I accept this. Life is good.
QUE HERMOSA VUELTA
Can't stop listening to this song ♥️🤩🔥
Will Ferrell really knows how to bang those drums!
Frusciante un groso!!!
O sea la voz era tener a Frusciante
John fukin Frusciante is back!
# Black Summer
John Frusciante de volta! Esse é o red Hot que eu conheço.
🇧🇷❤️❤️
Hey great look Anthony, if dorky was what you were aiming for you hit a bullseye!
👍
Same old. Has-beens.
🎶🔝2022 💣 RHCP Forever 4life
Bien para estos tiempos de mierda, buen sonido Hendrix, están haciendo un buen trabajo preservando el rock en estos tiempos de ignorancia musical  algún día triunfará la verdad que así sea
Disse-lhe Jesus: Eu sou o caminho, e a verdade e a vida; ninguém vem ao Pai, senão por mim.  João 14:6
When Danny California came out everyone said they ripped off Tom Petty.  I couldn't hear it.  BUT this is definitely Seminole Wind by, I believe, John Anderson
John is back ...
What the heck! They never get old! ❤️✨
Que incrível a sensação de paz de ver vcs sendo vcs. Fodaa! ❤❤🌶🌶
I love you so much guys! Thanks for this masterpiece!!!
Que bom, venham logo para o Brasil assim que puderem quero ver um show de vcs ao vivo.
Caracaaa, amei demaisss 😍😍😍😍
WAIT WHAT!!!!!
love love love
Glad the porno stache is still kicking
Vi amo 😭
They are an amazing rock band
nostalgia has entered the chat
Oh gosh the nostalgia...and the guitar riff by John 😢 brought me to tears it was so powerful.
Anthony looks like modern era Davey Havok lol
Los quiero mucho Chili Peppers
Guitar tones steal the show
Los amooooooo 😍😍😍😍
Who’s the new guitarist?
Track 14 on their new album is called VERONICA, wonder if it's a cover of Elvis Costello? C'mon April 1st, hurry up an get here
hasta la webas
Why Kiedis sound so Scottish lmao
I enjoyed listening
Los Mejores 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow! No fluff. Just a really good song.
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
🤙🇦🇷👌👅🤘🤘
John faz toda diferença ❤️
Welcome back John, you have been missed ❤️
Fazem 16 anos, mas parece que foi ontem, sem dúvidas lendas vivas compondo músicas.
Jhon Fruscuante i am Sol from Argentina i wish meet you so much
Yes yes yes, who would have thougt the band with socks would age like a bottle of red whine. I for sure didn’t. Great work guys!
<3
O mundo vai voltar aos eixos após esse lançamento! ❤️🙏🏻✨
Now that Johns back, we have two tickets to see these fools at a stadium in Charlotte this fall. Like the new song by the way and looking forward to seeing you guys
This might be their best song since "bye the way"
Dang Anthony Kedis is aging and it shows. Lol.
Thank God, somebody released a rock song.
Boa música mas por favor Anthony larga esse cabelo a lá Damiano do Moneskin 😅😅😅😅
It's not the full sound or vibe without Frusciante, glad he's back, maybe we'll get lucky and have a good new album
Mais do mesmo...
Amor infinito para los Chilis ❤️🌶️
Buenísimo!
This might very well be the last dying yell of true rock and roll we are listening to. Amazing
Ver a John feliz es lo más hermoso del universo 💕
Great song but what the hecks going on with Anthony's look... hipster-heroine-chic
Frusciante's guitaring gives a bone. The End
Brand new album but its frustrating John wick replace John Frusciante 😅😁🤣✌️
He’s looking for his Dani  She does not care   How far will he go  Before he gleans  Your zephyr is already there  You already have her Cause we all share the same light  When will you see We aren’t supposed to fight   no matter where we shine   we never change intensity or velocity   You didn’t break the girl Someone beat you to it She had to shatter  To know we matter  It isn’t hard to see that she is right  The waves in her head  It’s a violent sea  She never really broke she won’t stroke  she see’s now that  This is all a joke   we are meant to live in this season  who cares who’s watching? It all happens for a reason    There is parallelism  In their systems Their light shines brighter together  We tether   At some point this all ends, so can we just let our oceans blend?    Anthony you’re already a teacher to me, you’re in my head already, I don’t need to see you live to be at the party. I was born with front row tickets, and the show is in my head, and I see you in me. You don’t have to say anything. Thank you for simply allowing your light to shine bright enough to reach me. I know it doesn’t matter if you see my light or not, I see it, I see yours, and I see everyone’s. We are all excellent. Thank you for understanding me before I understood myself. And for passing on the rhythm. Thank you Flea, thank you Chad, thank you Josh, thank you John,  thank you Hillel, and all of the others. Everyone even down to your manager. Everyone who inspired you guys. I’ll never let my light be dimmed again. Suffering is apart of life, I want to feel it all.
Are verses sung with an Irish accent?
Thank God John is back!
Black Summer Is A Great Straight Up Rock N Roll Song By The Red Hot Chilli Peppers And Totally Rocks It Needs To Be Fully Cranked Up All The Way To Full Maximum Volume.
Not sure about the lyrics but the sound is classic RHCP. Maybe too derivative of their old style - sounded almost exactly like some of their old songs. They seem like they're older and more sedate - maybe they should embrace that age and and innovate on the sound a bit more?
# Black Summer
Finally something new to make us alive again ❤️
# Black Summer
Chili Peppers siempre 🤘🏽🎸
# Black Summer
I love you guys
# Black Summer
Nice to see Will Ferrel and the gang are making music again.
# Black Summer
I freaking love this song and I love you guys🤟😎🤟❤❤❤❤❤🙏✌🤟
Guitarist: John... Wick
Finally came!  It's the birth of a masterpiece like them!
jhon frunciante  es unico  no desmerito al anterior pero en los  red hot   el chilli peper le da esa manera de tocar  y esos coros
Cosa bonita, cosa bien hecha RHCP está de vuelta.🥰🤘
Wellcome back John ! So happy to see these guys again !
RHCP ARE TIMELESS. LEGENDS.
https://youtu.be/ssfkASaR2Ww
This melody are touching the soul and remebering the old Californication❤🔥  Together again!
The world grows more divided the Chili Peppers grow closer
You know the solo for this song is going to be even better live... John throws in some variation...  I almost enjoy listening to their live performances more than studio..
Los amo
que bom ouvir o JF no RHCP novamente! bem vindo novamente JF esperei muito pra ouvir isso novamente!
Diego Verdaguer vive!!
Will Ferrell has gotten better at the drums.
I dig the song and fuck yeah that John is back!  but whats with how he pronounces some of the words early in the song?!?
God I have missed John's playing in RHCP.
I love you guys ❤  Saludos desde Chile.
ACABEI DE VIRAR FÃ RECENTEMENTE AGORA OS CARA LANÇA MÚSICA NOVA E ÁLBUM NOVO É BOM DEMAIS
4th of February is my birthday and this is literally the perfect gift!!!!
O som do John Frusciante é único e inconfundível, harmonia perfeita a guitarra com o back vocal
Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Screaming crying throwing up they’re finally back !!!!
Argentina, present! ☺♥
Never get tired of these guys... Welcome back John!!
สุดยอดเหมือนเดิมครับ
MEU DEUS! RHCP DE VOLTA COM O JOHN, SAUDADE DESSA STRATO.
One day Anthony won't take the shirt off and it will be a sad day.
Frusciante's guitar playing is king. 👑 Welcome back!
RHCP 🎧🔥
Wow once I saw frusciante I knew this was gonna be serious
1:52 sola miserável.
Tirando a nostalgia. Música mediana que não faz nenhuma diferença.
I been waiting..I been waiting.. the peppers no exactly how we feel..been waiting
16 anos esperando esse momento. 16 anos desde o Stadium Arcadium. 16 anos sem ouvir essa química entre a guitarra e o baixo, sem ouvir esses backing vocals únicos. Só quem é fã desde sempre sabe o que estou sentindo agora. Essa música é um marco em nossas vidas.
Nossa mano muito top parabéns . Vocês envelheceram né kkkkk desde a californication vocês se superaram 🇧🇷🇧🇷🤣🤣 🇧🇷
Rasa yg dulu pernah ada. Tapi sedikit ompong, kurang gigit, greget,
Seen it first time last nite as a matter fact Bridge
Nunca te tendrías que haber ido John 😪
If you're not smiling seeing Flea on top of Anthony's shoulders, there is something wrong with you. Love it.
This kicks ass
Joder tremenda obra maestra...
me siento un niño de nuevo🥺
Band wouldn’t be much without John … just check out all his solo albums .., this is his sound .., the rest are just helping out 😉
Não perde a qualidade nunca!
Jhon frusciante muero por conocerte 😍 sol desde Argentina  ..... Flea habla castellano ...q t traduzca...!!!
So glad to see John ❤️
Can't stop listening!
It is SO good to hear John back in the band.  Josh was fine, but John is the only REAL RHCP guitarist.
I love you guys so much!! I'm so excited to go see you this summer!! Love you guys so much
simplesmente perfeito. perfect
John!!!!  ❤️
When did Will Ferrell join the RHCP?
Los amo

THE LEGENDARY TOPLESS ANTHONY
He flea-pado
Rancak dan padu RHCP!!!... solo Frusciante  memang mantap... Sayang RHCP 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
So glad the Peppers are back, but when did Anthony become a pirate?
I'm a simple man, I see Red Hot Chili Peppers, I click.
Dale loco daleeee ! Capo frusciante
Realmente amo esto 🌶🌶
❤️❤️❤️
anthony looks more ridiculous each time i see him
Love it , feels like home :)
Some Irish accent from Anthony at the start
Oh what a time to be alive

Joe Exotic

RHCP ainda vive ! Jonh seja bem vindo ! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Grande Diego Verdaguer...
Well family we have OG Chili Peppers again🔥 It's gonna be a great year for music
Sooooo excited for this and the Unlimited Love album comming!!! can't wait!
Shit! I don't like any other band's!
Love how the drums come in later
Am I the only one suspicious of an April's fools day release?
"Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin’ on another black summer to end It’s been a long time and you never know when Waitin’ on another black summer to end"  This is my favorite lines.
Fuck!!!! I love this.... John Frusciante is god!
COISA LINDA!!! RHCP MAIS VIVO DO QUE NUNCA 🌶🔥
Really love rthe music video,shows so much colors
Awesome!! 😍🎼❤️
Another Fab 4!
thanks.
Cara! Que foda ver essa formação de volta! Música nova, clip novo! Essa banda faz parte da minha vida, e da vida de muitos, essas guitarras do John, eleva muito o som da banda, o cara é um músico fora do comum, tava vendo as últimas entrevistas dele, o cara não para de criar. Tô feliz!
Escuhe la guitarra y dije... Frusciante!!!!!!!!
Stadium Arcadeum parte 3? XD, me encanta esta canción mantiene muy bien su esencia a pesar de los años , a esperar a escuchar el álbum completo
If yall are gonna come back you gotta come back strong with 50 belly dancers. Js😆
As always, John is the best thing about the track
หนูแทะหัวหรอ55555555555555555555555555555555
How good to hear Frusciante's viola again Que bueno volver a escuchar la viola de Frusciante 👌👌
Muito massa esse som dos caras, claro né, feras que são, não tinha como esperar algo diferente desse nível. 🎸❤️
Dave Simpson will be wetting himself over this track and the fact John is back :):)
I loveeeeee you RHCP
GOD como de costumbre
Frusciante!!!!❤️
Do zobaczenia na koncercie w Budapeszcie< niech moc będzie z wami  😙😙🤮😙
I rock with anything that Red Hot Chili Peppers create.
this is as close to hendrix as they have ever been...and i love it!!!
True men
This song just came out, and honestly, it already feels like it's always been a part of RHCP's classics. That's the magic in their sound. They truly capture the music.
Why didnt the man have california in his song?
Anthony is still ripped at 59...nuts!
this is damn so good
Oh My Good, The CHILLI PEPPERS, Wow Is Amazing
The more I listen to it, the more I like it! 😩❤️
Will Ferrell can act and drums. He is inspiration for all. Night at The Roxbury is instant classic. #blessed
This is exactly was 2022 needed. I could cry its so beautiful
Parece uma faixa lado B do By The Way... Boazinha!
JOHN!!!   The boys are back
Hearing John's lovey guitar work with this band again has me smiling from ear to ear. The world needs this now.
So excited for this summer, hope that I can see you in the Netherlands in Nijmegen!!
待ってました!! I've been waiting!!
PULL YOUR SOCKS UP… THE CHILI‘S ARE COMING! MIAU 😸
RHCP LEGEND🤘🤘🤘🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
worst stache ever
THE BOYS ARE FUCKING BACK.
Holy fuck!!
Frusciante <3
Percebi que a bateria segue o mesmo ritmo de Californication, seria essa uma referência ao segundo retorno do Frusciante?
Anthony's head looks creepy.
es raro verlos viejos, pero es bueno verlos !!
❤️‍🔥🌶 Lyrics 🌶❤️‍🔥  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew  (Get it on)  My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Fru is here...nuff for me.
The greatest band in the fricking world!!!! Love you guys!!!!!!
What a breath of fresh air. John is back and by the beard of Zeus, its mighty fine
John Frusciante is such a good guitar player, idk if I like Keidis's style in this song though.
well to wait for the álbum
Uma vida escutando Red Hot,e ver esses quatro juntos novamente é de arrepiar,e ainda lançando um som absurdamamente foda como esse..😭😭😍😍
John🥰
Good to see them making music again can’t wait to hear what else they release
Anthony and those lyrics. Man is a great writer / poet, then you’ve got that great music behind it. Doesn’t get much better. Glad the Fearsome Foursome have returned!🤘
RHCP FOREVER
This song has no energy.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Been waiting for this!
Obrigado
I fucking love this band.
That Flea smile and the switch to John made me cry literally
Jesus Anthony, you look re goddamn diculous 😂
No me mato el corona virus pero este tema me va a terminar de matar de lo buena que estáaaaa !! ❤️❤️❤️
Qui doidão
Só a melhor banda do mundo pra criar um álbum novo mas que traz nostalgia. Ansiosa pelas outras canções 💕 Frusciante is back 🎸♥️
Amazing
John está de volta!
Awesome! I missed new material so much! And the riff is so Frusciante, which is always great!

Anthony is slowly turning into iggy pop
VIDA LONGA AO ROCK!!!
I am glad Will Ferrell is back doing what he loves. But man we need some more cow bell!!
John Frusciante jangan keluar lagi dr RHCP. RHCP seperti kekurangan darah tanpa John Frusciante. Sorry, ini pendapat subjektif saya.

Otima musica, ja ouvi umas 10 vezes hoje, diferente, linda harmonia e melodia, vai estourar, de novo pra variar, ja gostei mais que Dark Nessesseties
Wow! They're really back, huh?
AMO VOCÊSSSSSSSS DEMAIS
Man, Frusciante is one those musicians that you can't just imagine without their instruments. They play with such a passion that you can even feel it and now that he is back, it just feels like a hug right to the heart after all this World's current situation.
❤️👀
Merci !!!!!
covid-19 : im gonna stop the music industry....  RHCP: Hey covid, STFU!  pure joy.
Y un día volviste otra vez que genio que sos John se te extrañaba 🥰
Espere muchos tiempo hasta que por fin hoy se hizo realidad!!
Más más más más más... Vamos rhcp quiero más música 🎶🎵🇵🇪
Looking forward to the new album!
That was terrible.
GENTE, O FRUSCIANTE, ELE, MDS. O FRUSCIANTE MEO.
I love this band 🤘🏽🤘🏽🚀🚀 🎸 🎼
See you in September Orlando!!
👏👏🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🇧🇷
Can't wait to hear the new album. Frusciante was always the secret to their incredible music and the band just is not right without him. They have a chemistry as musicians on stage that is incredible to watch and they are not them unless all four are there. Feels like the band is whole again and I can once again enjoy listening to their albums. Didn't give more than a single listen to the albums they did without him. The music just was not nearly as good. Josh had a high bar to live up to replacing a guitarist like John and he never could play nearly as well and I didn't like the group without John. For the last 15 years or so I've been living off of the greatness of Stadium Arcadium wishing he would return many times a year for the last 15 years or so. My wish is finally granted and I'm so happy.  Can't wait to see the amazing live videos on YouTube of these guys on stage again and the amazing improvised solo jams they will come up with on the new music. Can't wait to hear the new album, even more anticipating all the variations of the guitar solos from the album that we will see from live videos. Frusciante is amazing. The band is amazing when all four are together. Wish we knew a release date for that album but at least we know it's likely to drop before their June world tour starts.
O FRUSCIANTE ELE, ELE, O FRUSCIANTE. TIPO, ELE. AAA
Eu meio que, MDSSSSS. BRASIL EU TÔ AQUI!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ EU TE AMO FRUSCIANTE!!!!
🎶 waitin’ on another black summer to end 🎶
Finally some good rock and roll. About. Fucking. Time.

Cuida Brasil, mais um clássico pra gente curtir, Aqui no Ceará Agente Ama Vocês...
I LOVE THEM
Will Ferral is back.
Will Ferrell toca demais.

"WAITIN ON ANOTHER BLACK SUMMA TO END!!"   INSTANT CLASSIC
OS HOMI VOLTOU CARAIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just what the hell! As always, they step it up another level. Right out of the blue, no idea hell yes!!!
Getting some Californication vibes here. Welcome back John!
Dale Frusciante y daaaale y daaaale frusciante y daaaaale y daaaa
Insane boys!
JOHN IS BACK!
I love that the comments are in multiple languages.  Unity through music!
Awesome song, can't wait to hear the whole album.
strait FIRE boys !!!!!!
Woooooaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! Está parte de mi vida se llama felicidaaaaaad jodeeeeeer! 🌟 En mi plena juventud escuchando nueva música de los Red Hot Chili Peppers con John Frusciante, que privilegio 🤩🤩🤩
Jesus is back 🎸😎
aaeeeeeee cacete!!!! saiu a parada! <3
Que??!!!
Flea es nuevamente 100% feliz y todos los somos con él 😊
John is John, there is nothing to add.  RHCP is these four gentlemen if substitute anyone from them - it’s possible to get awesome band but it won’t be RHCP
Rock and Roll is Alive!...
are these guys still kickin' around?  I bought 2 albums of them when i was still 14. Learned the lyrics and even performed singing their songs
fazia tempos que n ouvir o RHCP  quanta sdds do meu tempo de colégio  e que som legal viu.
God bless RHCP and John! You are born to be together. Go make the world happier. We wait for you guys in Brazil soon.
❤🔥
Ouço esses caras desde os meus 3 ano, quando tocava Under The Bridge na novela "Corpo e alma"... Revê - los e ouvi - los é mais íntimo que rever um parente da família !!! Ainda vou assistir vocês ao vivo !!! Vocês fazem parte da minha vida sempre !!!
Delusion. They came back to their 30 years ago music. No verve, nothing new to tell.. they became the Coldplay of their genre
Listening to this song feel's like waking up to a "SUNNY" crisp clear beautiful new day !!!!!!!!!!!!
Does anyone else sort of hear Jethro Tull?
For guys who used to write big hits whilst extremely high... Don't you wish they still were, just a little?
My favorite band forever ❤
LEGENDARY. Thank you guys.
awesome!
This song sucks
yep john is back
RHCP melhor banda fazendo som.😎
WE MADE IT. UNREAL.  <3
Unlimited love for you guys ❤️ amazing 🤩
Well, I've listened to this song 2441731times, I love it! We missed you guys! Thanks for coming back! :)
This theme is so Wonderful ❤
🔥
My first ever concert was RHCP with John in 2004 in Phoenix Park Dublin. I will see them again with John in June. This band has got me through so many hard times.  Cannot express how happy I am to hear this new song. Amazing. Lads, the chilis ARE BACK!!! FK YEAHHHH!!!!!!
LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
HOLY MOLY I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES OR EARS
Matthew 25:45-46 King James Version 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
OH SHOOT
jajajajaja un momento pense que  el vocalista era el chaparro chacheneger. jajajajaja
What a great moment to be alive ❤️
O HOMI, ELE TA ONN!!!!!! GOD SAVE RHCP
BR dominando os comentários 🥵🤟
Pitch correct much?
This has already been playing over and over in my head. Glad to see them reunited and making music again!
É RHCP PORRAAAAAAAA
this aint it dudes
Básica e direta, sendo precisa e suficiente. 👏🎶🎶
No sé por qué la gente cree que los Chili Peppers siempre harán la misma música con los mismos conceptos. Ellos hacen de todo, si no te gusta solo podés rajarte.
🍾🥂 <<<<<<RED                HOT🔥                           CHILI    PEPPERS>>>>>>>>🍻🎸🤙🏻
Esplêndido
Jonh Frusciante voltou para isso. Hendrix deve está chateado.John Frusciante came back to that. Hendrix must be upset.
esperaba una muy buena cancion, pero siempre me dan algo mejor
Não creio que vivi para ver música inédita do RHCP com o John
lessssss goooooo
🇷🇺 Respect from Russia!
Amazing!!!! I love this band!!!
I'm trying to digest these lyrics..sit tight
Sea shanty tiktok × RHCP
Oh hell f’in yea the legends are back & better than ever! Love it!!! 🐐🌶🔥🤘🏼👏🏼
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
My dream is watching them live, I am 33 and a fan since I have memory. I lost my dad last March, I hope this album helps me like all the prior albums helped me in my darkest times, i thought they were my darkest times...
Love the music but the way he's pronouncing the lyrics is...odd.
Grandes mis Red Hot Chilli Peppers, me hace tan feliz volver a ver al señor Frusciante de regreso y en un nuevo clip, los extrañaba muchísimo en verdad
Vim ouvir pelo meu ex 😌💛😭
bravo!
Que privilégio o nosso estarmos presenciando isto!! ❤🖤🌶 😍🤘🏼❣🇧🇷
Anthony looks like… 🤷‍♂️ like some guy or character put in Napoleon Dynamite movie or something.
Yes! They are back!!!
Finally, after a long long time, the real deal again!
Sir John Frusciante🌶️1️⃣0️⃣ 🙏🙏🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One simple sentence. Welcome The F### Back.
The year is 2022 and I’m here listening to a new Chili Peppers song. I feel blessed.

Happy birthday to me🙏

I liked Josh, the getaway was one of the greatest albums of RHCP. But I must confess, Frusciante is amazing!
Deeeeeeeeeeeemaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaais. UUUHUUUUUUUL
I'm very glad that Frusciante come back to RHCP, but this records sounds to me little bit plastic and isolated. I'm bit confused...
Tremendo tema !!
Holy shot this song rocks
FRUSCIANTE!!!
los amo
My new favorite song
La quimica con Fruschiante  me da mil años de vida ❤️❤️❤️ aguante rhchp
¿Hay algo que no hagan bien estos muchachos? 🤩  Impresionantes como siempre, excelente canción. 🤘
Awesome
This is one of the MOST amazing, stellar, cosmic and united songs I've ever heard from them! This album may turn out to be their greatest yet, I can't wait!
Love how Chad Smith still rocks the house painter look after all these years!
Ah yes good to see Will F back on the drums.
Pedrada 🔥🔥🔥
*_Better than Red Hot Chili Peppers:_* https://youtu.be/JNgCW-XOLh8 👇🏻
Acho que vou infartar de tanta felicidade 😭
Entre tanta mierda(trap y reggaeton) que hay hoy en dia.. musica como esta te hace ver que la humanidad aun tiene esperanza!
Brazil 🇧🇷 tuned to the sound of Red hot chili Peppers 🖤
I was 13 the very first time I listened to them and I fall in love with their music, now I am 35 and I still do. I've never get tired of them. I think I'll die loving their music.
simplemente genial.
John is back!
anyone else out there who sees the good old by the way times in this track 👨🏻
Just revisited this it’s jumped from 20K 15 hours ago to 2.4 M let’s go!
That guitar dough !
Welcome back John "Guitar GOD" Frusciante
Os melhores voltaram. Uhuuuuu
Los dioses tatuados han vuelto
É um milagre o jon ainda estar vivo e disparando notas como balas. Um grande exemplo de superação de um viciado cheio de problemas e até desacreditado por muitos. Fé em si mesmo é o que define esse cara
Me hicieron llorar hermano
John!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aleluia!!!!!!!!!
Mediocre
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer...
Que sensação incrível poder ver o frusciante de volta. Que som 🎸🎵
The band is finally whole again.  I have waited what seems like an eternity for this sound to hit me again.  Well worth the wait. This is the definitive sound and lineup.  Thanks, gents!
Meu Deus, que bosta que virou essa banda!!!
Black Summer - Red Hot Chili Peppers  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the Moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on)  My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the Sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailing on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Frusciante killed it. Legend! Sounded like Gordon Lightfoot on vocal for part of the song. Prove me wrong. 🤣
:0
Cosas que hacen de mi día y mi mood algo más colorido. Esta formación es un viaje directo a los maravillosos 2000.
Décimo-segundo álbum da discografia de estúdio dos Chili Peppers, “Unlimited Love” marca o retorno do guitarrista John Frusciante à banda .... só alegria
Amei verão negro 🤩🇧🇷💪
Mediocre song, sorry to say.
Não me canso de ouvir ... Você são perfeitos em tudo que faz . Amo vocês ❤️. Que música perfeita 😍
Tá ruim não
Ai que saudades 🔥🔥🔥
JOHN ANTHONY MOTHER FUCKING FRUSCIANTE SOUND IS BACK!
I can't wait to see the chillies in Manchester UK June 22nd this year
Welcome back, guys 💎
The kings are back !!!!’
Hope I hear a song sung by John or mad backing vocals would be great treat
saudades de um som novo de vocês, obrigado RHCP <3
Will Ferrell looks great in this music vid.
John Is Back!!
🏴🏖🔚
so glad Will Ferrell came back to play drums on this
*OMFG   F I N A L L Y ! ! ! ! ! !*
A melhor formação fazendo sempre as melhores músicas!
Frusciante is god
When did Gary Allen start doing vocals for RHCP
Yes! The one correct and genuine thing that happened in 2022.
☆RHCP☆🔥🔥
Suena a una cancion que tranquilamente podria estar en Stadium arcadium...aca te das cuenta que el guitarrista de la banda tiene que ser por siempre frusciante...
so much love for these guys
💥🔥💛☀️
Legends. Same feelings and vibes as 20 years ago. Such a joy to see and hear John again
Well... so? Not that good but, ok... they're back
I knew the guitar when I heard it.... <3 FRUSCIANTE <3
Man, so looking forward to new material from RHCP. Personally a number of the songs hit a chord with me, I have been a fan since my teens in the 90’s and I love pretty much the whole back catalogue. The Getaway struck a chord with me, released a month after I lost my dad... the album got me through some very dark places in my mind and for that I thank it ❤️
😮😮 very nice job 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What a good day. First Liam Gallagher single now this one. Man <3
Simply amazing. Good to hear all you guys together again, and still sounding just as great
que lindo la musica de verdad sin autotune
Love u guys
First note hit and you knew it was RHCP, can't wait for more!!
So... Best lyrics ever
Viva RHCP! Viva Frusciante!!
Que momento, meus amigos, que momento….
CARALHOOOOOO
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
I'm speechless! I feel like I'm in another dimension! I love you very much!! ♥️♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷🤟🏻🤟🏻
ive been waiting
New era unlimited love this is gonna be an iconic album I can feel it
For those in the know - been too long!
Major Stadium Arcadium vibes. So glad to see the boys back
No perdamos más el tiempo, Ya denles unos 5 grammies  y a celebrar
сижу сейчас и слушаю это, улыбаясь. любимая группа в лучшем составе, прекрасная песня! хочется на мгновение оставить все и просто стать частью этой чудесной музыки.
they are great thank you for this work of art, every word and chord is perfect.. Los amo... Que gran regreso....!!
Eh... honestly, a huge let down. It feels formulaic and uninspired.
Thank God, John is back, getting major Hendrix vibes. Excellent song guys. Rock Out MFers.
He needs to grow the hair on his head back out and cut cousin it off his upper lip
0:54 orale se me parece a Keanu Reeves 🎸🎶🎶🎶
♥ Coração até erra a batida
Gracias por  Volver , una maija del 1 d e Abril
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
What a day to be alive.
Well that sucked
Hell yes. Welcome back boys. 😎
ALL WE NEEDED

ジョンのギターソロ泣けるぅ〜(T 0 T)b
New popular song with two tasty guitar solos? Yes please.
🤘🏻
I’ve been having a pretty hard month lately and it feels like the band saw me and reached their hands out to me. This song is amazing and I can’t wait for the album! Love you RHCP!
Love it💯✌️
I always love Will Ferrell on the drums.
you know it's gonna be a banger when Will Ferrell appears on the drums
New echo single always hits different

They live a fantasy land.  Will stay there.  You, deal with communism.
What's up with his accent lol
De que habla la cancion
Nice to see Will on the drums
I am from Moscow. And in Moscow of the nineties , being a fan of RHCP was not the most common occurrence . I've loved these dudes since 1991. All their ups and downs are in my heart . Thank you for being together again. Thanks for the magic !
holy shit i cried 0:46
Anthony now looks like white a version of Eddie Murphy
So happy to hear you again!! Thank RHCP for that emotional moment when you start to play music!! 🤗🤗🤗
So great to have John back!!! 🌶🌶🌶 forever!!
Geez love you guys RHCP , amazing song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice
👏👏👏👏lindos!!!!! Maravilhoso como sempre🥰🥰😘😘❤❤❤🙏🏾
Por qué todas sus canciones son temazos?
T.Q.M Jhon Frusciante
HASNT AGED A FUCKIN SECOND.  HE IS RISEN.
Will Ferrell is still rockin those drums although i wish there was some cowbell.
"Playing from the heart will never fall out of fashion"
Having a new RHCP song / album with Frusciante make me so happy !
Fantastic song!
John the Power!
Great, u are great!!!
Red Hot Chili Peppers being Red Hot Chili Peppers! Geniuses!!!
Increíble!!!! 🤍🎧🤍
since 6 years old until now always RHCP
The maestro is back 🔥🎸
Lo mejor de lo mejor. Saludos desde Guatemala 🇬🇹
I've been waiting too!  obrigado!
damn dem guns
I want moreee, a breath of fresh air
Nossa impressionante que com o John de volta traz uma musicalidade estilo Stadium Arcadium né mds rezei tanto pra ele voltar eu amooooo
If this is the worst song of double album of lets say 25 songs it would be still very bad song.
Love it!
God is back
How long time Will ferrell play on drums with rdhp?
Vendo o John de volta chega a da uns arrepios pqp muito bom
Mi Banda favorita saludos a todos desde San Antonio de los altos, Venezuela 🇻🇪
У Фли на басу наклейка профиль Ленина. Пролетарии всех стран соединяйтесь!
Yes yes yes yes yes 🥰🥰😍😍💋💋💋🥰🥰💋💋🥰 they never lost the great touch of them just beautiful great lovely and tremendous music they give for so many years love you so much I and when i hear this music is like blood running in my veins just beautiful thanks 👍💋🥰😍💋🥰❤️
Goosebumps...welcome home John🖤
Well it's about f'n time. Their patented groove is, always has, and will be alive.... fortunately for us, the fans and family. Thank u guys....it turned my fucked up life around for a moment.
Tak długo oczekiwany efekt,. Warto było. Mądrze, refleksyjnie, klimatycznie, jak zwykle. Kocham Was !!!!!!😍😍😍
I have a feeling that this new album will be on the same level as Californication. Hoping I’m right 🤞
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
I'm really proud of Anthony he's really fighting off the urge to throw is some those juicy lines ike " Ding ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding ding" or "EOIOIEA"
An another fire from you.  I have missed you RHCP so much. I'm so glad for this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ my best band for ever
Dang John .That 62 is sounding awesome.OK you guys . You sound awesome. Hope the album is this great
Suddenly, I took a detour through the previous century for three minutes and fifty-three seconds.
Journalist: ‘So, Anthony, what were your influences for the vocals on this track?”  Anthony: “The Worzels, Reef, and pirates”  🤟❤️🤘
SSIIIIIUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!
Amazing shots with the video and editing.
Wow
I love RHCP
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great song. Just can't get over AK's 1980s-soccer-player mullet/pre-WW1-hitler-mustache mix of a look.
JHON IS BACK!!!
Finally! 🙏 Good to see you back guys!
Que chido ver el último trabajo de Diego Verdaguer (con Frusciante incluído) 😊
бальзам в уши
Eu sabia que iam lançar uma música nova
Such a complete Sound.Such a complete Family! I hope and pray y'all continue as the most melodic band I've ever heard .
I lived to see this moment come 🤩💗
Frusciannntteeeeeee
Ahhhhh 😗🤩
👏👏👏👏👏
This gives me mad stadium arcadium vibes
Kralhooooo john ver vc no rhcp de novo é uma emoção incrivel minha inspiração  na guitarra
Hands down my favorite band! Seeing them still dropping heaters is a testament to the bands ability to transcend generations, thx u all for keeping rhcp thriving!
Glad Frusciante is back.
Awesome song! Can't wait to hear the rest of the album!
the prodigal son returns....this sounds like RHCP in their best element
After 30+ years of being an RHCP fan, I may have to finally see them in concert. It would be nothing short of tragic to miss their genius firsthand.
RHCP with Frusciante have something special!!! Now circle is close again.
Beautiful. Just this.
Mais waaaaaaw
Esta banda é maravilhosa e com Frusciante ela fica grandiosa, uma das melhores de todos os tempos.
Lyrics pls?
Não tive maturidade suficiente pra esse novo single e a volta do John.... chorei e pulei em casa minha esposa e minhas filhas perguntaram o que tava acontecendo.... e simplesmente disse q tava assistindo um sonho se realizando. Simplesmente... vida longa aos nossos Peppers!!!!
The skies may have refused to cry, but we couldn’t help ourselves to see you all back together.
Tremeeeeeeeeeeeendo!
Listened now for the first time, it's immediately Magic! In loop for the next days, welcome back RHCP!  🙌🙌🙌
Larga vida a RHCP !!!! gracias por tan buena música 🖤
Mais do mesmo, musiquinha comercial.
Yeah!
OMG
DIOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS LOSSSSSSSS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That guitar tone, the fills, I missed this.
Temazooo
Los 1
What does he mean by: The archer is on the run?
ギターを弾きまくるジョンが帰ってきてくれて嬉しい・・・。
John's fuzzy tone just hits different
you little duck house
Joder, gracias por alegrarme el día red hot chili peppers, Los amo!!!!!
Muito obrigada por existirem! Melhor banda de todas e ponto. Ainda estarei presente em algum show de vocês, é um sonho que ainda irei realizar! <3

Песня подходит для финала истории Артура Моргана #rdr2 #rockstar
It's good to see John back again.
Kiedis got old. Mayby it's the mustache.
The first one minute of this song is pure Pepper perfection.
Que emoción verlos juntos, me hacen lagrimear...
Liberal 🤡s - Real Title
5/10 not enough californias
That opening guitar riff though. So glad JF is back.
Things that could make you cry: onion, someone s death, literally John Frusciante.
Frusciante ❤️❤️❤️
¿El coro también les da un aire a Stadium Arcadium o solo es idea mía?
It's good to see you back John
Lol wtf is this shit? Talk regular.
Gracias chochamus ♥️
Fantastic!!!!! As always!
Lixo.
More than 30 years producing good music! Thank you!
These guys are awesome!
John Frusciante... we are not worthy!
Wow - hearing it for the first time had me in some kind of spiriual mood. To me this is the biggest RHCP vibe in 20+ years. Really hits differently.
No tiene sentidooo lo buenos que son
🎊🎉🎊🍻🏆🍺🥇🏆🎊🍻🍺
Finalmente, como los amo ❤️
They're Back Baby!!!!
ROCK YEAHHHHHH
yawn
I just cry like a baby hearing it just beautiful!
Jhon amazing
I  listened the song all day. It is  awesome! I want more! ❤️
That solo...
Come on samurai)))
Sounds like a californication B-side
Only line up id go see of the peppers. Hopefully they come australia
Sounds a bit like Gordon Lightfoot.
These guys are earths spokesband to the aliens
Estos abuelos aún están vivos?
Yessssss Great song , i'm very very happy ...good come back , John  :)
Sabbbbbbpeee
Super amazing! Love it! Come to Brazil!!! 🔥
La guitarra de John que abre paso al mostro de Chad. Here we go again!!!!!!!!!!
very glad to see john here
лучший состав и гитара, как всегда, просто плачет в руках Джона
I’m so happy to see Frusciante back in the band! Almost as happy to see that Strat of his back in action - if that guitar could talk….
I have been waiting for this since so long
What a fucking song!!! They are better than ever! Can’t wait to see them live!
Jethro Tull approves
UHUUUUU......Que saudade desse som, dessa harmonia, dessa vibe....QUE SAUDADE!!!!!!!..❤️❤️🤩🤩🔥🔥🎼🎵🎶
Be Loved 🔥
A banda do século.. atravessam corações e as mentes de várias gerações...
Frusciante the GOD
Caraaaaa, que gosto de nostalgia PORÉM TOTALMENTE ÚNICO!!!! Ficou perfeita, cara quero chorar, socorro, Glória a Deus, n paro de ouvir!!!!
Wow Will Ferrell did really good on drums

This album wouldn’t be a hot if frusciante didn’t leave the band for a while and come back to revive the band.
Love this music!
ale gniot.
A perfect return to form.  Not overproduced, each member clearly heard, but effortlessly meshing into their seamless whole.  Yay !!  Boys are getting old though.
❤️❤️
AGHHH! FUCKN LOVE THIS!
It was true, they were right all this time   Christ has finally returned ... to the RHCP❤
Only good thing about this song was John's guitar solo. It sounds like everything else they've done. Not bad but it's been done before.
Welcome back John, we missed you greatly
AMAZING <3
RHCP...😍😍😍
RHFCP!!!! Yes… Red Hot FUCKIN’ Chili Peppers!!!! They’re Back!!!! 😎😎😎 Awesome!!!
Not feeling it. Disappointed.
Everyone loves this new song in my family and we cannot wait to see ya’ll live in Nashville in august!!
Thank goddess Frusciante survived his demons.
Red hot chili pepper is an jojo stand
Kcalb Remmus
No shadow over Klinghoffer. He is a good player but not the same crafter of tunes as Frusciante. There is also something in Frusciantes tone and timing that is very hard to copy. Great to see him back.
Perfection
If Stadium Arcadium and Californication had a very glorious and beautiful baby
Joya
Só tenho que agradecer a Jesus por ele ter voltado ao rhcp
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Thank you to the biggest band in the world ❤️
Yes John is back!!! Amazing!!! I can't wait for the new album!!!!!
oh i really like this song 😍😍 https://youtu.be/Bu1BEunRJQo
Hey John! Good see you...
UNLIMITED LOVE ❤️ QUE PUTA FELICIDAD!!! Los amo fuerte
👑📀✨👊🏻✨👊🏻✨👊🏻✨👊🏻📀👑
Τζον αγόρι μου ξεκάθαρα  ήταν ώρα  να γυρίσεις ! Welcome back guys!
Eu esperava mais! Mas há algum tempo, os peppers não escolhem as melhores dos álbuns para serem as divulgadas, tomara que a escrita tenha sido mantida!
Vivan los Red Hot siempre 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
holy fuck dude i missed them!!!!
Dios mio, esos vocales de Frusciante, increíble
Essa é a banda q representa minha adolescência e até hoje sou muito fã dessa fantástica banda 😍 linda canção
Que bonito cuando una banda se respeta a sí misma, conservando su estilo, siendo fieles a ellos mismos, sin vender su autenticidad a ningún precio. Exquisita pieza musical. Gracias por existir RHCP me recordaron mi infancia y adolescencia con estos sonidos.
OMG, muito obrigado por fazer mais uma obra de arte RHCP ♥️
💪💪💪💪
AWESOMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From Brazil 🙋
Red Hot Goodness 🤘😁🤘
Al fin regresó!!! Después de tanto!!! ❤️🔥
This is new age
John, don't leave Peppers anymore!
:')
Not one mention of California? Something's off hahaha
It’s good to see John where he belongs.
Esto está de rechupete!!!
😭❤❤❤❤

Does Anthony Keidis even age tho? 🤔
Queremos a los Chili Peppers.... Queremos a los Chili Peppers.
Son como el vino, mientras mas años mejor.
this means a lot to me ...i can remeber when i was this happy the last time .ok the day they announced that john is back but you got the point :D
This is the 1st time I’ve ever shed a tear over hearing the guitar.  When Frusciante left RHCP I regretted so much not ever seeing them in concert. Now that he’s back, hopped on it right away when their tickets went on sale.
I'm one of the junior high shool student in japan. My english is not good. bat I love this song and RHCP.
Amo a esta banda desde muchos años atrás , estoy demasiado feliz , hoy fui feliz ! Espero verlos pronto ❤️
México presente 😍
Frusciante is back! And demn a new album is coming! And on top of that! This song is lit!!!! Nice solo there!
Great single, continuum of RHCP beautiful energy, hoping the rest is as good or better :)...
БЪЛГАРИЯ ТУК ЛИ СМЕ
❤‍🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤
They sure do have their formula down 🤙🏻
As long as it rhymes, it’s fine.
WELCOME BACK JOHN!!!!!!
This is the new Californication. Welcome back.
Legends back at it!! 🥺😍🤩
John Frusciante es Amor, es Paz, es el mejor :)
RHCP 4ever ✌🏾
Will Ferrell still on point as always
初めて聴いたのに、どこか懐かしい感じ！間違い無くレッドホットチリペッパーズの名曲だっ！ 早くニューアルバムが聴きたい！
The Return of the King
I've been waiting too, we've all been waiting...
Olen aina tykännyt RHCP musiikista, muuta tällä kertaa kyseinen kappale ei herättänyt suuria tunteita. Varmasti saa jonkin verran radiosoittoa, mutta jäi vähän jotenkin vajaaksi heti alussa.
So cool seeing Will Ferrel rockin out
I can cry for see John another time in RHCP
Magic
I DONT LIKE THE MELODY.
Anthony, Flea, Chad, John! I hope you guys will read this: an amazing job has been done and the song is awesome! I listened to it about 15 times today! We are REALLY looking forward to new releases! Thank you for the magical 20 years in my life! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!   Big regards from Moscow!
I hope my neighbors like this song
Proof once again that nobody plays like John and that magic happens with these 4 chaps
Hoje eu ouvi essa música mais de dez vezes muito boa melhor banda de rock do mundo
Seems like the style doesn't not make it anymore. Very cheesy but yeah....things changes.
Learned the greatness of RHCP through my mom, and we're both so excited to see you guys in Detroit this year! Thank you for your passion and the memories you offer. 💕
Glad to be alive right now.
Man, will Ferrell is a beast on them  drums 🥁
John from 45 to 55 seconds....I love how that sounds haha!  Can't stop listening to just those 10 seconds 😄

Better than what offspring did. They tried to make bank on their shltty coronavirus song.
JHON BACK ,PERO NO ME GUSTO LA CANCIÓN Y ESO QUE SOY FAN
So many spanions in the comments
Great song but personally I'd like seeing John on the guitar more
HEHEHEHEH
OMG THIS IS AMAZING! I missed u guys and welcome back john❤
🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
Як же гарно. Дякую за чудову музику
You guys have no idea how much I love this band ... every song 🤩🤩🤩
back to the roots !!!!! Amazing song !!!!
Encantado con esta canción ❤️
Q perfeito.
This is absolutely trash
This song fits perfectly into their catalogue
John puts on the flanno & Strat & off we go.🔥🔥
Anthony's form is remarkable, he's almost 60!
there's something different about this song but in a good way. thank you for the new song, i can't wait for the album🔥🔥🔥
I swear I could've heard this back when I was 16 on the radio. Wow. Pinnacle RHCP.
AMAZIN .....AMAZIN.....
HERMOSO!  Hermoso verlos juntos, hermoso ver a Frusciante, hermoso sonido y energía. ¡Larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, Bien hecho!
Looking & Sounding So Good !
❤️
Joder, ya le hacia falta esto a la música ❤
Nice
I'm backing in time now... watching MTV... thanks RHCP.
fruscianteeee, fruscianteeee, fruscianteeee,
Get the message on Flea's fist! 🌶
Lovin me some RHCP..... thank u👊
foooooooda demaaaais
u2 vibes
А Кидису почти 60... И он веган, кстати.
When you know a whole band's discography and they release a new song that is actually pure and doesn't sound like anything else you have ever heard.... You know you are lucky to be contemporary with such a great band. I simply love you guys!
yo si me mie cuando vi  a Jhon, que emoción 🙏🤙🤙
Te amo john frusciante. Red hot pra sempre
♡
odgrzewane nieświeże  kotlety
Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of the few bands I never have to press skip on any song too 💙💣💣 Dope always
Sucks. They've lost it
Ladies and gentlemen, John is back! ❤️
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
É ótimo ver Frusciante de volta mas a música não superou minhas expectativas.
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
https://youtu.be/v9tvMrazFz8
Eszéletlenkirály! John Frusciante egy kibaszott rockisten!!!
Feckin the boyz look great!!! Chilis 4 life
Diggin it!
I love them, but... wow: what a mediocre song!
When John morphed into the frame I screamed "JOHNNNNNNNNN" IM EXCITED YA'LL. Welcome back buddy
wow welcome back!!
Parabéns, com o John o nível é outro, PERFEITO.
<3 Lo lograron, esos hijos de p**a lo lograron!
I’ll forever miss josh but this is awesome <3
Love It!  Right On!  Aloha!
TAO LINDO, TAO ESSENCIAL, QUEM É FÃ SABE O QUAO SURREAL É VER ESSA FORMAÇÃO JUNTA DNV
Eu escolhi essa banda para amar. 😍♥️
The more I listen to it the more I like it
Obrigado , sério , de coração !!! Obrigado por me darem isso ... Vocês estão de volta , isso é fantasticamente fantástico ... Que final de música com a amada Guita do John ! 🤫🇧🇷❣️🌚🌞
Will Ferrell is looking so good despite the years ❤️
M crying right now
they're back.
Great video. One of the top RHCP ones imo. The editing is excellent. The fx are understated but strong, as fx should be. The song grows on you, especially after hearing it in full quality on Apple Music.
É o Red Hot caralhoooooo!!
Que alegria !!!!!❤️
2:51 los red Hot  en estado puro 🌶️♥️
The formula's wearing a bit thin, eh? Completely underwhelming.
1k to 1mil in 28 days 😉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwADBQKQ3pq6_GM7cfm3ZZg
siento la influencia del disco The Empyrean de frusciante, buena cancion y john ufff se siente fresco el grupo con sus riffs, no menosprecio el trabajo de josh pero se escucha la diferencia.
Well. Red hot is kind of back again. Klinghoffer is talented,  but no RHCP without frusciante.
Far better than Liam Gallagher's new song with "DAVE" on the drum's !!!!!!!!!!!!! Scientific fact !!!!!!!!!!!
John is back!!!
I love you Anthony ❤️‍🔥
Rooooooooooooock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why does Anthony look like Joe Exotic?
John Frusciante and the RHCP are back... This guy makes them go
Grazie ragazzi ❤️‍🔥
Why’s he singing in an Irish accent 😅
ZEN
A fantastic Song. I want to have the album now!
and everything is right in the world again... We got Frusciante back!
Уходит эпоха, когда рок был добрым и романтическим... RHCP - это навсегда Californication и отличные вечера с друзьями под их музыку!! Глубокий поклон ветеранам и спасибо за очередной шедевр!!
Its time to retire and let other rock bands be heard,  Foo Fighters as well
🖤
hermoso
Guys, don't become Scorpions with all that "the very last" stuff, please
was that will ferrel playing drums wtf??
Delícia de ouvir😌😌
¡Me salvan la mente!  🔥 ¡Su música me salva!
Anthony looks like John Bernthal in 15 years’ time 😂
...or begin
14 años esperando este momento! Volvió el sonido, volvió la esencia, volvió la MAGIA! Que pedazo de solo se mandó John!!!!!🙌
Let's welcome the Legend Frusciante back to his home turf 🤟
Very good :D
Anthony looking more J-ish every year.
Can we talk about Flea with the paint brush? wth lol
The instruments of the song is good .but  the way anthony sings in this ruins the song in my opinion. Sounds way to off . But everything else golden .
Isso que é banda de Rock uma das melhores do mundo é que eu mais gosto essência essa é a palavra que define essa banda principalmente com a formação original
Loved 🖤🤘
Da hora esse som lembra os velhos tempos muito bom.
That guitar sound is just SO frusciante... It's actually crazy how such a simple chord can be so distinct..
Ohhhh this is just so easy to listen to on and on 🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩
Been a fan since the 80s, still enjoying the music!!
ZZZII, NUEVO TEMA!!!🤪🤘🏻
GRACIAS JOHN POR VOLVER! LA CASA ESTA EN ORDEN!! LOS AMOOOOOO!!
it took 1 minute 28 seconds for kiedis to go shirtless.... That might be a new record
Bienvenido John!!!! Con todo respeto a todos los que han sido integrantes de RHCP, esta es la mejor alineación de la banda🤘😌
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
RHCP sigue con esa energía de siempre y esas canciones que te llenan de sensaciones únicas 😁  PD: Anthony Kiedis está mamadisimo 😮
0:46 the legendary strat returned
Didn't know that Arthur Shelby is the lead singer..
Cadê o funkyblackcock
It's amaaaaazing!
They've obviously used their lock down wisely producing another good rhcp tune. Love the guitar rift nice to see John francusci back. Flea delivers as usual. For a guy who is nearing 60 Anthony good shape. Well done
Welcome back Johnny!
So happy today.  So great to see John back in the mix.
Good song that's elevated to a stellar level by that Hendrix-like solo.  John has such an amazing sound....
Сергій Машевський :))
Nunca mais saia do Red Hot, Frusciante. Esse merdas só acertam a mão com sua presença na banda.
One of the best bands ever
Geniossss pensé que no iba a ver de nuevo a Frusciante en los Red ....gracias 🙏
Hell yea! Frusciante is just 👌👌
Esperei tanto por esse momento 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

LARGA VIDA RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS🖤
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/
Очень рад видеть ребят в отличной форме. Гитары Джона очень не хватало. Песня неплохая, но и не отличная. Уверен, они могут лучше.
No hay comparación, la magia de los red hot es de otro plano. 💥 Larga vida Jhon Frusciante 🎶
крутая песня!
I like it 💜
JOHN FRUSCIANTEEEEEE
So happy to see you guys back together. Cannot wait for this album
3M V1EWS LET'S GO !
Eure Zeit ist gekommen! Ich hab mich so sehr auf euch gefreut aber ihr seid leider nur noch die beste Live Band der Welt 😭 das wart ihr schon immer 😭
Looks like the key to eternal youth is to take heroin when you are in your peak then stop - kind of pickles you in state of rippedness for ever. Iggy Pop will back me up on this. and this track  is yet again fantastic -  so refreshing in a time when most music is shite
Thar cionn ar fad
John!!!!!!!!!!
Great guitar from John as always :)
Tema ql bueno 🔥🔥 aguante los rhcp , Frusciante puto amo 🎸. Saludos de chile 🇨🇱
Volvieron con todo! 💜💜💜🎼🎼🎼
Sono capaci di creare solo capolavori...nient'altro da aggiungere....
If John keeps rocking that strat (which he will) it's going to look like Stevie Ray Vaughan's soon! Beautiful, thanks guys for the great music. Loots of support on this page and I "love" it. Keep shedding light on a dark world fellas!
Vou escutar sem parar até abril quando sair o álbum todo 👌🏻
This had a few morw than  thousand viez 8 hours ago. So happy to  they have now millions.
fruscisnte  ctmmmmmmmm
Este tema sale luego de que perdí a mi vieja y de los dos años más difíciles de mi vida.   Es difícil de explicar racionalmente pero el hecho de que este tema hable de esas cosas, con la vuelta de Frusciante, después de 16 años, me hace pensar que se puede volver de este black summer del orto que es la pandemia.  Los quiero mucho a los 4. Que siga fluyendo esa música, el mundo es más lindo con ustedes juntos.  Abrazos desde Argentina.
YET ANOTHER INCREDIBLE PIECE OF ART 🖤🖤
Sounds like it could be straight off staidum arcadium
There back yesssssssssssss
Man it's hard to believe the last time I heard a new Red Hot Chilli Peppers song with John Frusciante's iconic shredding was back in 2006 when I was in Primary School!
Good to hear John back
Habemus Frusciante! \o/
Thank you John Frusciante for picking up your guitar again.

As someone who was born after most of RHCPs songs came out I‘m thrilled to still get to see new songs from them❤️
O Frusciante é foda!!!
Love the Stadium Arcadium sound and feel of the song!

Love the Chili Peppers but to be honest Im not really feeling this song n if this is there offering as a single I can only hope that the tracklist for the new album has hidden gems...
love to see Will Ferrel still riding that Ride Cymbal into the sunset, I mean after all these years he' still grooving smooth like a shark in tuna infested waters 🦈🥁
Del segundo 0:44 al 0:55 Frusciante me hizo volver a emocionarme con la música!!! Larga vida para los pepperss!!
Кратак повратак у давно прошлу младост. Хвала !!!!!!!
Sublime cuando estan los 4
That Strat alone is living it's own blues...
RHPC❤❤

It's good to be a part of history to talk about it to our children I mean RHCP, Pearl Jam, U2, Cypress Hill etc... They are still on
The guitar solo GRABBED my attention 👍
WOW! Will Ferrell is sitting in on drums?
One of the most distinctive sounds in music. I only have to hear the bass or drums to know its the Chili's. This song is 🔥

"Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end

Justo a tiempo, en esta época donde el mundo y el sistema nos tiene a todos atrapados y a la mayoría deprimido, sus canciones ayudan a olvidar un poco lo malo de esta sociedad...🌶️🎸🎶
Frusciante has still got it !!!🎸 🌶
Creo que ya lo escuché unas 20 veces
Now it is official. Corona is over on April 1st. Nobody talks about COVID after the Album is released. 🤌🏻
Por más que pasan lo años no dejan de perder el estilo, una de mis bandas favoritas🤟
One of the few bands ever to have each record sound completely different than the previous and keep spawning new generations of fans, true legends. Been a fan since 89’ keep rockin
Ideeemooo breee ❤️
The song's been around since the beginning of the day and I already listened to it 100 times... great job (again), RHCP.
Sound from Stadium Arcadium is BACK !!! 😍 True RHCP 🤜🤛
Cara, que saudade do Frusciante! Que saudade da minha banda! Vcs são fodas d+!! Que música boa da porra!! Ouvir vcs me traz uma paz que nem sei explicar!! 😌🌶️🔥
The video does the song no favors. Reminds me of the Billy Squier video that ruined his career.
Great song! Feels like a mixture of Stadium Arcadium/Californication vibes. VERY Frusciante. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
j'aime tellement ce que vous faites , chacun à sa façon m' émerveille , j'vous envoie de la force et de l'amour des bisous

Vocês são incríveis!
Mullets, Mohawks and Red Hot Chili Peppers!
Me encanto..❤QUIERO  VERLOS EN  VIVO en 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Top❤
Que som!
Why couldn’t they keep Josh on the band? There’s plenty of bands that have more than one guitarist. 🤔
This Song has broken the internet !!! 🌶🌶🔥🔥
Sras y sres. Los Red Hot Chili Peppers!
The song is fine but the video is pretty generic.
This song is like a big hug from an old friend ☺️ life moves on, people come and go. But RHCP have remained a constant
I remember being in highschool listening to the stadium arcadium CD. I would listen to both discs back to back while I was grounded in my rooms for months at a time for bad report cards. Times were so much simpler back then and yet the bands music stays the same.
I'm so happy to find this jewel the day it publishes! Great familiar sound with a terrific twist. I'm eager to drum this in my set now. Long live RHCP!
Its still a cool song but I don't like the auto tune on Anthony's voice, part of the charm was his slightly off key tone for me
Ну наконец то!!!!😍😍😍
Ultra!
So Will Ferrel AND Keanu Reeves play for them now. Also If new album sounds like this I'm so excited.
Me encanta que nunca pierdan su estilo único en todas las rolas♡
Digging the 90’s vibes 🤘🤘🤘
I hear David Gilmour in the solo
❤️❤️❤️
Props for making a non-catchy song that ends up being catchy anyway, great atmosphere for the intro and first verse, good chorus, no need to talk about the guitar sound which is as tasty and juicy as a cooked steak still dripping blood and everything's fine with this very irritating friday. I would have liked the final part to be harder/heavier and maybe last one repetition more or two
Frusciante, no te pongai longi de nuevo porfa. Te amo❤️
Wow 🤩 amazing awesome job guys like always!! Rock-On 🤘😎🎸🙏❤️
AAAAAAAAAA Frusciante returned!!! 💖😃😃😃🌶️🔥 Best song a lot!!! I love u, guys!!
Yeeeh! Cool! Like from the best times! Russians loves you) Thanks for this
Genios.
Red Hot está de volta! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Cracking nostalgic tune here but unsure on Anthony’s accent?
Pretty cool really, considering these guys are producing music like this on their way to 60 years of age.
Фрущ повернувся - лайк не слухаючи!
Que momento para estar vivo...
2:40 "Riding on a Hitler's horse!"
Whoever autotuned Anthony's vocals should be ashamed of themselves.
оооооооооо даааааа
Да! Это охрененно! Вспомнил как в детстве слушал Californication)
Anthony Thanos had to sacrifice the last guitarist Josh to get the soul stone and bring John back : )
Wow.. I just cried.. I cant imagine seeing john again in the band... and his sound..and his vocals.. I love him so much.. its so good to see them together again. Cant wait to see them in italy this summer... JOHN MOTHERFACKEN FRUSCIANTEEEEEEEEE
this is my sixth time watching the video🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤
Who knew Keanu Reaves Shredded Guitar 🤣🤣 JkJk!!
A Black summer is a durk summer. Like the durk side of the Moon. But with earthly surroundings. Pretty durk.
Frusciante is back! <3
¡Grande Diego Verdaguer!
The soul is back on my body 🤩
boring, they shouldn't have parted ways with Klinghoffer imho, he really added something on the last two albums, not against Frusciante returning but they should have kept both him and Josh... (on the 6 or so non-RHCP albums they both collaborated when they were good friends, whether John's solos or Ataxia, I felt the two were really complementary playing and/or writing together and those projects sounded like great musicianship...). maybe one or more members didn't like the idea of two guitarists meaning this could potentially get in the way of another part (vocals, rhytmic section ?), it's a shame because they toured for a little while like this and it worked as far as I know, maybe they were afraid of this corrupting their "creative process"... but this one sounds dull to me sorry... Adding that "I'm Beside You" was maybe my favorite "contemporary" RHCP album...
JOOOOOHHHNNNNNNN
Hell yeah! I'm so ecstatic RHCP is back with John! Epic af 😍😍😍😍
The only band where u don’t know the name of the lead singer /guitarist but know the drummer and off course the bass name
are back🔥🔥 you are my favorite since i was born and this return makes me fill so emotional. thanks for return here! long life to the rhcp.  a fan in Italy
😎
Only 1080p?
i didn't know Will Ferrell could play the drums.
DIOOOOOOOS PORFIN GRACIAS FRUSCIANTE POR ESTAR RHCP SON LO MEJOR DE LA VIDA
P*ca e o resto é buraco
After almost 12 years , THIS is what they can come up with ?? What a stupid song … very disappointing in the Red Hot … Thumbs down 👎
Song from Netflix series?
I love you John, welcome back!!!!! come to Brazil please.
Que emoción lpm
Oh my *god* how does John get that tone?
Ok, Frusciante is back, blablabla, but this video is awful
Good to hear some new Rock n' Roll for a change... Check out Liam and Dave Grohls new track "Everything's Electric" 👍
Finally! We are back to guitar solos
2022 MEUS AMIGOS 2022 E OS CARAS ESTÃO FULMINANTES #NUNCAMEXA
Com o Frusciante é diferente demais, vida longa! Ainda quero ver show aqui no Brasil!
Eu amo vocês de um jeito que vocês não tem noção !

Diego Verdaguer Last Song
FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!   It’s been too long.
woooooooowww nueva musica de los Red Hot Chili Pepers njd lo mejor de lo mejor
Cómo se siente el impacto de tener de vuelta a John Frusciante en el grupo!!!!! Sin desmerecer a Josh que hizo un gran trabajo en los años que estuvo con los RHCP, pero Frusciante es otra cosa :)
Voltando no tempo, muito bom vivênciar esse momento esse quarteto tem uma conexão incrível , essa música mostra o quanto essa banda tem a oferecer ainda !
Bentornato john  🙌
YES!
RHCP has that sound that is so unique, you just know it is them!
So great to see John reunited with his mates! What a sound! Can't wait for the album! Thanx, guys!
Lindo está...
Просто кайф
Love this!!
O Kiedis tá só na capa da gaita.
hendrix vibes
Will Ferrell is great on drums!!!

Seminole wind by John Anderson, anybody?
Mistura de By The Way com Stadium Arcadium!
Feel like this vid hit 1M views in under 6hrs.🤔 Thoughts?
very medieval feels, guess we are living with a plague
Classic Red Hot
John Motherfucking Jesus Frusciante is back
Why the accent Anthony?
De las pocas bandas que nunca perdieron su estilo y escencia a pesar de los años !!! 🤘🤘🤘
Still ripped eh? ok then.
Как же ты состарился мужик...
Whenever John is there, things just seem a little more... right.
Damn that part when they all come together 2:50 gives me chills, it’s beautiful
Gracias!!! 🙏
nunca me decepcionan... mi perro y los red hot son el amor perfecto!
The return
Anthony...this sucks, but the band sounds great. Same as it ever was.
NICEEEEEEEEEE
Welcome back guys...!
🥲❤️
Only one word....magic...
Now tell Anthony to shave that mustache and grow his hair long. Back to 1991!!!
Flea and Will Ferrell haven't changed in years
Greatest song again! Thanks for soundtrack of life!
Crazy they started in 1983 and still slaying it.  Chilli pepper for life!!!
Fusciante saved you again !
Fantastic song grooves and moves me along as I keep my eye on that Fantastic full Stache! 🤘
John Frusciante makes this band SO much better!
Poderia ter deixado o Josh com e Fruciante nas guitas :/
I'm shaking and crying and puking at the same time. This is so bad :(((((
0:49 Frusciante came back looking like Keanu 😂
No estoy llorando, tú estás llorando
Stadium Arcadium vibes
Anthony has a real "Joe Exotic" vibe going on in this video
2M wow the world is till a better place 😎😎😎
Like your favorite pet who needs to be put down but you just can’t do it  so they  live under a bridge way way  too long. At least Chad still has it!
Missed that guitar sound for years, not just rhcp, but general. Year 2022 will be great year!
Why is John Frusciante so damn cool?
Damn, Will Ferrel does an amazing job here
Gracias Gracias gracias por estar de regreso ❤️❤️❤️ saludos desde México 🇲🇽🇲🇽❤️❤️❤️

RHCP e fodaaaa! 2022!!!
Already a classic. Love it!
They're back! Amazing!
When did Tiger King dye his hair?  In all seriousness the guitar solo is fantastic 👏
the Solos where the best part
This is the true RHCP sound! huge admiration for Josh but Frusciante is king!
La mejor noticia de este verano es que los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers tienen nuevo album.

Moment when Frusciante threw that solo is extraordinary that i had to repeat it several time just to comprehend he is finally back🌶️🎸🥵 #rhcp

Em vez de usarem imagem artificiais poderiam ter ido tipo ao deserto em vez de uma sala totalmente fechada com sol artificial

John Frusciante es reconfortante que estés de nuevo en casa y creando ese sonido que tanto nos gusta que le hace mágico a la música de RHCP
Thank you RHCP for reminding me that rock'n'roll is still alive!
RHCP never seem to age. Both musically & personally, theres so much passion 🔥🔥🔥
Glad Frusciante is back!
flaye q antoni la iba a re kagar, pero mencantaaa
I bet that  drumset got ballsacked
Gonna tell my kids this was on Californication. Anthony look 45 years old what a stud.
i Love You!!! i from Russia.
Thx God! John is back!
Anthony Kiedis still shirtless, traditions are traditions
que buen regalo ! cumpli 49 ayer!!!
can we appreciate that they're all over 50 and still in great shape...it's a shame all that success and still no shirts?! LOL
Música Boa, porém o clipe não é grande coisa faltou mais criatividade parece que algumas coisas não ficaram legal como falar durante a música e no final todos entrando tocando parece um erro que não consertaram e deixaram rolar.
the avengers are back
Been a long time indeed. Welcome back 🌶️ peppers!
Esto es la definición de alegría
Estava morrendo de saudades!!! Muito bom 👏👏👏👏👏
✨👊🏻✨👊🏻✨👊🏻✨💣💥💣💥🤙🏻
Anthony will never get over Sinead O’Conner 😂
LARGA VIDA ESTOS 4 SERES SUPERIORES

Perfeitos amei ❣️🌶️
Will Ferrell still kicks ass on the drums

do you miss josh?

Cuando te preguntan cuáles son las cosas que recuerdas de tu infancia casi siempre lo primero que resuena en la cabeza de uno es la música, bandas, etc. Y los recuerdos más fuertes están siempre con temas de Red hot chilli peppers de fondo. Me pone feliz seguir escuchando cosas nuevas de ustedes, siempre. ¡Gracias!  When they ask you what are the things you remember from your childhood, almost always the first thing that resonates in our heads is music, bands, etc.  And the strongest memories are always with Red hot chilli peppers songs in the background.  It makes me happy to keep hearing new things from you, always.  Thanks!
TIME TO SPREAD #UNLIMITEDLOVE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH  Rock Jesus is back! RHCP 4 LYFE!
Anthony really aged
disfrutando un tema de los peppers
I'm sorry, but this song should be called Black Stache.. haha JJ  love it!
Just checked, this band still blows. John take your talents elsewhere. Leave these other three dbags behind.
Honest Take: It was a touch on the formulaic side, the highlight is Johns solo.
Anthony kiedis- "I've been waiting" The rest of us- "same"
Oh shit, it's actually good!
Remember that 14 year old you wrote a love song about?
Felt like meeting an old friend. thank you guys, we need you more than ever
Gracias Dios 🥺
Will Ferrell play the drums good!
CON ANSIAS PARA SABER COMO SONARÁN SUS OTRAS CANCIONES!!!
It blows my mind that these guys are 60.
Tem louco que daria deslike nessa musica ?
Everybody talk about Frusciante but Flea is the best as always!
Sunny here!
RHCP não decepciona nunca 🇧🇷♥️
ЕЕЕЕ КАЙФ!
I didn't know Will Farrell joined the band 😂😂😂
SUPPORT RHCP ON SPOTIFY TOO!!!
RHCP DESERVES MORE! KEEP STRE4MING GUYS! 3M V1EWS LET'S GO!
Uma obra de arte.aguardamos vocês no Brasil. 🇧🇷
RHCP need to break thru to another sound…another vibe…this sounds too polite…too easy on the ears. .. too forgettable
THE GUITAR SOLO, JOHN IS OUR KING
volvi a invierno del 2006
John's guitar  tone is RIDICULOUS!!!!! ....sounds so fluid - like cascading  notes within  a waterfall of sonic beauty!!!
Fuck yeah man, what a treat this was. This will be on repeat for some hours today. Tomorrow and the next day also. Who knows how long really but this song was so good!
im not really into the song but rhcp still have their music video game. One of the coolest ones ive seen in a while
I fucking love this band, man.
LETS FOOKIN GO!
Still have that organic feel they have had since day 1. I love the RHCP. They never disappoint. 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
How long has Will Ferrell been drumming for them?
✳🌶❤
I wonder what Fantano will have to say
This filled my heart with warmth. How I have missed this band.
dissapointing. 10/10
No hate to Josh at all, he was great. But John being back is sooo cool
Lame.
Me acabo de derretir completamente 🤯
Este pequeño momento de mi vida se llama felicidad, pura felicidad :')
What a nice effect 2:23
Masterpiece.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK Frusciante!
this would be waaaaay cooler if they were trying to 're-do' higher ground rather than trying to 're-do' under the bridge.....just sayin
This is why the band just isn’t the same without Frusciante. They immediately sound complete again
Still awesome, still AMAZING.
Where's the socks ?
I hear a lil sea shanty in that song! Great American band. Bravo!
Like a breath of fresh air! Seriously love this band. Welcome back John
This is probably one of the happiest days of my life! Welcome back legends
As strong as anything on Stadium Arcadium. Like 15 years was 15 minutes.  I still miss Josh in this band, though.
Great song. Great to see you guys sounding so great
posturing transcendence that you could buy in plethoric market freedom is choice for goods and services you could, sell us your soul lifestyle preachers singing  ecology  from the valley of consumption on the belly of the beast we've been...silent all along...  while our military killed millions  to burn more oil we destroyed the land  we stole from Méjico but we use our cool to dress pill cia wrote the errand so, we call China ill
wow
2 Million in fuckin fifteen hours, who told the rock is dead?
Старый, добрый перчик
Here we go...welcome back John
Welcome home John, we missed you. ❤️
Love you jhon♥️
Pedovors
Русские любители этих великих дедов на месте?
não cansam de fazer musica boa!!!
0:44 Flea smiles here enlightens my day :) thank you guys
You made me cry 🥺🤟😎☝️ RHCP in my DNA 💪
¡Los Red Hot lo volvieron a hacer ! Simplemente los RHCP
John hasn't aged a day 😭💕
Made my day! Thank you.
Truly amazing🤘🏼🔥
Diooos
Legendary band..❤️
Legend
🤷🏻‍♂️♥️
OBRIGADA POR ESSA MÚSICA! VOCÊS SÃO DEMAIS
Together you guys are Magic! 🙌💟🙌
Anthony got to get rid og his mustache, he looks like Tiger King with it 😂😂
QUE SAUDADE <3
Você fez falta John ❤️
Exotic Tiger ha salido de prisión y canta con los chili peppers? Lo más innovador son las pintas de hillbillies, lo digo en perspectiva, yo que he comprado todos los discos, y los sigo desde el 91, que la única reinvención fue One Hot Minute. Mi humilde opinión. Ahora los  ultrafans podéis dispararme
Morgada que só
Os caras continuam com a mesma energia de sempre. Ansioso para o novo álbum!! 🇧🇷🔥🌶
Long life for John ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭. Red hot Essence intact
hey look, they are wearing shirts!
2022 and anthony's still shirtless
A bit underwhelming but still looking forward to the rest of album
https://youtu.be/lluuxDH5fvw
man, their last two albums havent been bad. But this. THIS is what i've been missing. Can't wait for the album.
Forse dovrebbero andare in pensione.😞
STILL GOT IT!  See you in August.
The song doesn’t officially start until Chad kicks in, but once he does, he holds steady until Johnny sails with that sweet, sweet solo!!!   I LOVE THE CHORUS!!! These guys aren’t just back, it’s like they never left!!!
All i have to say is that i love this band
# Black Summer 🤩
I have been waiting this for a long time.
WOOOWWW
I hope the rest of the album will be better ... That one is quite boring and disappointing ... Just think, if it wasn't for the RHCP, would that song have become known worldwide ??? I don't think so ... They are a great band and have proven that with their songs many times in the past ... Waiting for the rest of the album, to discover some "gems" ...
Amazing Song
All i want!
Frusciante seu lindo
He's still in shape "That would be a waste of tiiime"
What a great sound to hear once again...These four guys make the band.
El talento de todos continúa,  no pasan los años para ellos. 🥰🥰🥰😊
os cara tão velhote, mas ainda faz som da hora né
la química que hay entre estos 4 es impresionante !!!  RHCP lo hizo de nuevo!! Por quinta década consecutiva!!
Stupende vibrazioni
como é bom ter o John de volta!! essa é a vibe do RHCP!!!
Frusciante still got it...
Перцы 🌶 😻

I’ve been waiting I’ve waiting I’ve waiting for a new album to come out 😎
Nunca superarán californication
Que emocionante e triunfal a entrada de todos os quatro juntos novamente no mesmo palco após o solo do Frusciante! De arrepiar! Vida longa aos nossos Peppers! ❤️🌶️🤘🏼🇧🇷  How thrilling and triumphant the entry of all four together again on the same stage after Frusciante's solo! Long live the Peppers! ❤️🌶️🤘🏼
Why John doesn't f****** get old!? :)
Nothing in this flat track...
❤️🔥
John!!!!!)))))
Man, this is awesome! I love how the Chili Peppers sound the same now as they did in the 90s! Don't change y'all!!!!

YES VERI GUDI ROCK IN ROUL YEEEEAR 🤘🤘🤘
Soul touching. All i can say
Daddy already loved u when this song came out
I cant believe they got Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrel to be in the video
Welcome back John we have missed you! Edit at the solo around 2 minutes I had tears in my eyes! I missed this feeling!
Had to listen again, first time through thought it was whack… but I’m sure by the time I hear this track another 1000 times it’ll be a hit.
dream come true at last
RHCP IS BACK 4 GOOD!!! Thx SO MUCH!!!
I’m ugly crying right now 🥲🙌🏾💜
I LOVE YOU GUYS! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌶️
♡
Es aqui donde los hombres de cultura se reunen despues de tantos años :D
Obrigado Deuuuuuus! <3
Really emotional  Can't believe the original 4 are back and better than ever
Tom McDonald dropped a hotty today also😎
Kiedis is 59
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And china’s on the dark side of the moon Hear me now!  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew Get it on! My crater weighs a ton The archer’s on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It’s been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin’ on another black summer to end It’s been a long timе and you never know when Waitin’ on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailin’ on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  It’s been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin’ on another black summer to end It’s been a long time and you never know when Waitin’ on another black summer to end  I’ve been waitin’, I’ve been waitin’ Waitin’ on another black summer to end I’ve been waitin’, I’ve been waitin’ Waitin’ on another black summer to end I’ve been waitin’, I’ve been waitin’ Waitin’ on another black summer to end
My dream finally came true...Thanks RHCP ❤️ Like if you needed this magic feeling again 🌶️
Still the best band in the world. No other band comes close
Curioso pra ver o resto do álbum ❤🇧🇷😎 #hype
Winyl zamówiony 🔥
Nice little reference to Behind the Sun 🐬
Кайф. Пятый раз слушаю
Ele é diferente
The dream team Is back!!!
Una de las mejores bandas que nos dio el rock viva los peppers por siempre
Glad to see you John!
Rhcp are legendry there like 55 and still are elite
JOHN IS BACK, BABY!
John is back?! 👀
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Peppers arent peppers with out frusciante - when u listen to his solo albums u get why the peppers have been missing that old school peppers vibe - trust me listen to his solo stuff and u will see where chili peps got all that vibe -
Chorando aqui de emoção em ver o Jhon, o mesmo jeito de se movimentar com a guitarra. Amo!!!!
Sunset set shit sandwich
Que hermosa vuelta John, precioso single de los Red Hot!!! ❤️🤗 Los esperamos por Argentina!
Will Ferrell plays some mean drums.
2 миллиона просмотров за 14 часов. Вот что Фручанте животворящий делает.
Meh
JOHN IS BACK HOLY FUCKING sHIT
Amazing
Nothing surprising or brave about his song, who ever disagree with this, is a fan boy/girl groupy with no music criteria
Ontem estava ouvindo DarkNessecities e pensei, como estão velhos, mas bem que podiam voltar a fazer músicas pois são imortais... olha aí o presente ❤ RHCP ❤
Absolutely genius... I'm of to pre-order 😘
Хрень какая-то...
*RHCP FOR LIFE* 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Wow, I'm finally watching a trending video

So much love

reminds me how old i got , together with them...
Will ferrel is the drummer of RDCP?!?!?!??!?!??!?!??!
Another future classic , great to have them back and in fine form !
Soy yo o anthony tiene el cabello similar al de Julián casablancas? Jajaja
Wow. This new rhcp... I mean this old rhcp... oh, never mind. So wonderful to hear you guys so fresh but still... still like the very best of  you. Can’t wait to hear you live this year after all the crazy stuff that has happened over last 2 years.
RHCP !!!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷
I can see Will Ferrell taking the piss out of this sometime in the future
Otra vez Juancito al frente de la guitarra en los Peppers..... Simplemente..... BRILLANTE !!!
The new psicodelic chili Peppers,the best
Estoy feliz de verlos juntos una vez más chicos, gracias por existir ❤️
Maravilloso!
Why is old man Will Farrel on the drums?
The Chilis haven't sounded like this since Stadium Arcadium... which was back when I was a kid!!
u've saved my life
I’ve always loved their sound🤘🎸🥁
According to Anthony, I have been waiting
why is he speaking english like he's a french-canadian speaking english
Valió cada maldito segundo y años en volver a ver a Jhon frusciante con red hot chilli peppers sin duda como fiel fan de está banda ahora puedo morir tranquilo
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love this band so! Much!
Good to see Anthony shirtless again
John coming back feels like home. Incredible
Can't wait to see you in August!
They're back...
Solo 1:52 BR RHTP❤
Daddy like. Fire fuzz tone in the first solo!!!!!!
Ever since they turned into a Top 40 ballad band I find them extremely boring.  They got old and stopped rocking along time ago.
Unexpectedly nice guys, not many bands could pull this together after all these years. I remember thrashing Blood Sugar when it came out and it's good to hear that vibe again  :-) Very cool.
Stop calling they old, have some manners, respect!
Билан так постарел...
Frusciante forever!
nice mullet Anthony!
YES!
Sin palabras, que vivan los RHCP!!
Wow 🌶️🌶️
Chorus = Cable Guy
They're back😎
How did Anthony kiedis end up looking like Eddie guerrero
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else loops this song 1000 times since yesterday?  When I first listened  I was a bit disappointed to be honest. This song grows on you once you listen more. I really liked it later. Amazing harmony and chemistry. Super happy to see  Flea and John jamming together again after 16 years . Love you Chilies 🤘🌶🔥❤️ Ps. I really liked the AK ‘s vocal in this song, dorrk side of the moon 😃 typical AK weird but beautiful 👍
The accent is a little weird
Кідісу 59, мені 50. Ми що, залишилися молодими?

Nobody else finds this a bit uninspired as a first song? The solo is good and I'm into Anthony's new singing style, but Fleas bass is lost in the mix. I'm over the moon to hear a new John track, but I don't feel this is lead-single-off-reunion-album quality
Jesus I missed John. But is Anthony Scottish now?
Joe Exotic on vocals !
HES BACK LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO JOHN IS THE FUCKING GOAT
Whats this shanty sh?
Pretty boring song!
Will Ferrell is such an amazing drummer
Ehh not too shabby. Excited for the rest of the album
Nothing like the og rhcp, but very good instrumental
chills
Esses são lendas!
best from the best, как и всю мою жизнь
Танцы с голым торсом в шестьдесят — RHCP ❤️
Wow la misma escencia como un guitarrista cambia todo el patrón del grupo es i creíble Jhon
Welcome back rhcp!
ficou foda!!!!  Brasil 2022!! Viva Red Hot! Frusciante, new life in band!
hicieron una para el recuerdo nomas , frusciante! jeje
Anthony's ripped as hell for someone about to turn 60. He should lose that stache get a new hairstyle though.
holy motherfucking shit, he is back
Is borat? Uhm? 🤔
Diego Verdaguer, siempre te tendremos en mente DEP.
John Frusciante!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
New album means new tour? Please come back to buffalo we miss you
Ah, cara... Tô muito feliz em ver o Frusciante com esses caras novamente.
Hmmmm China's on the Darkside of the moon so they've got no fear of a higher power at all! But of course the yank has that fear doesn't he!!!???
Chad & Flea. One of the finest Rhythnsections in Rock Music. Typical R. H. C. P. groove and flow 🙌🔥💯
Неплохое звучание!..
Crack the flaming whip Sailing on the censorship Riding on the headless horse to make the trip.     I’m so glad you guys are back.
We have a guitarist!
John is back !!!!!!!!!!
r.H.C.p "▶️"📲 🔊🎶🎵🎶  🤯✔️
Me gustaaaaaaaa demasiado cool 😎 🤘🏻
La única banda que me ha hecho llorar de amor desde que la escuché, TE AMO RHCP ❤️🥺😭
Good tune. Bring back Josh, and get Anthony to shave his Porn stashe and you will be set!
I been waiting on another RHCP hit....I was not disappointed. :)
The Cure releasing a new album in 2022, Liam Gallagher drops a new single and soon an album, and now RHCP with a banger. Life is good
I think it’s safe to say that John has won the mullet game. Welcome back, boys!
Sublime!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately it sounds like something already heard...  Nothing new, after so much time. I am not so happy.. sorry guys
I don't understand why people are raving about this, it's flat and falls very short of their previous talent. The song lacks something, I just can't put my finger on what. Sort of like a taco missing the meat.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow blew my mind! There back! John is the the soul of the red hot chilli peppers 🌶 can’t wait to see them in Manchester England this year!
Johns part gives me chills
All the hand movements are weird, too many drugs over the years ,eh bud
Билан отлично выглядит
Vida Longa e Prospera a John Frusciante
The difference between with john and without john is so obvious…. ⭐️
Como siempre un sonido inconfundible. Espectacular.
Keanu Reeves playing. at RHCP?
Frusciante looks, like John Wick.
The real California sound! lml
I can imagine how many diferent solos John Will made in live shows 😍😍😍
Welcome back home, mr. Frusciante💜
fuck. this is so good.. good to have jhon back
Mmmmm.... un primer single muy flojo, la verdad. Además.. es como si hubieran retrocedido 15 años al sonido popero del Californication.. xD  Espero mucho mas de la banda con Frusc.. Me quedo con Dark Necessities, que al menos suena a algo diferente y mas funk.
The most solid band around the world.
Awesome 😎
Singing a ballad to the black sun(Saturn) I see. Not all of us are lacking in discernment.
You are teaching me how to get old with dignity. All of you enjoy a lot what you do and this is the gift you give to us. I love you boys. In your hearts and minds, you never get old.
esperei tanto por esse momento ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Los esperábamos 🇲🇽 ✳️
This song was totally unexpected. Made my eyes moist seeing John and the others jam together again. Welcome back John, glad we all made it! :3
In ecstasy! 1:52
This song is very reminiscent of the music from Stadium Arcadium and im HERE FOR IT. SO hyped to see what this album has to offer.
Hipnotizada no físico jovem do Anthony, um garoto de 59 anos 😍
" sailing on a censorship " is a great line
oh jeez fucking chriiiist
Acordei nos anos 90!Show!!
You guys have still got it. Thank you for releasing REAL music for us AGAIN.
Soy yo o Jhon Frusciante está destinado a los Red Hot y viceversa..... Desde luego volvió y temazo legendario para empezar
This has been here for decades, the feeling when you listen to something that just kind of makes you feel at home. Thanks you guys for another wonderful musical journey.
0:55 i love you will ferrell
This song increase vitamin D level
🙌🌶🔥
this lacks so much bite that it would not be able to stand out even as a Stadium Arcadium B side.
Los amo muchachos, con cada canción la rompen ! son unos cracks! Esta canción es un hit completo, frusciante y flea legendarios definitivamente!
so happy to see John back
Amazing song
Ах, какой кайф!)))
I feel home with this, after all these years I feel home again. Thank you guys, much love.
Nice Will Ferrell in the drums
increíble de frusciante al regreso a la banda de los RED HOT te amamos <3
Fruckin awesomely amazing
They're too talented... I love these guys, Frusciante rocking as always, essence that never changes, one of the best bands ❤️🌶
great song, but Anthony Kiedis' moustache almost predestines him for a part time job in retro porn movies...
Amazing!!!
Wake up babe new RHCP song just dropped
Bro these men get old! But I love it
Will Ferrell killing it on the drums as usual.
Un tanto comercial y poco que decir. Estos ya han pasado sus mejores momentos y lo que deberían estar haciendo es luchar en esta absurda guerra que nos ha tocado vivir. UNÍOS TODOS LOS MÚSICOS DEL MUNDO CONTRA LA TIRANÍA PSEUDOCIENTIFICA.
Rave techno Viking...👀
John is Back! Pure Magic. My neighbors will be hearing about a black summer as soon as I get home from work!
Volvieron hacer musica y eso me alegro large vida a los red hot chili peppers por estar juntos como banda👍🤘
Great to have some fresh RHCP tunes again ... when are you coming to South Africa again?
Big! Big! Big John Frusciante!!! I am happy to see you again!
hermoso
I think this takes it back to By The Way....can not describe how exciting it is to listen to John play again with the group.....this is like the difference between a store brand cookie and an oreo....there is just something that makes it just a little bit better...cant wait to hear the rest of this album!
It really is amazing that there exist people like them to keep the old things new.
They are their generations Rolling Stones. Timeless music, impressive longevity.
John's solo aside that's boring as hell
So hyped for Unlimited Love. I started listening around I'm With You, but because of my parents I knew about the glory days with Frusciante. The one thing I'll say about this album is that the song titles sound goofy as hell, but I'm sure they'll be bangers.
SUPPORT RHCP ON _SPOTIFY_ TOO!
ya pero la bateria de chad🥵🤌
Thank You Red Hot, thank you.
Nice to see Will Ferrell out and about still.
Only gets better and better with time
Very good
goat is back
Greetings from Morocco
Es increíble ver a un grupo de 40 años que sigue haciendo música apasionadamente. Experimentar varios concepto y géneros, no muchos lo hacen porque fallan en el intento. Pero con los Chili Peppers no sucede esto.
Picked up where they left off. Gotta see them this year.
Please play Slow Cheetah in august
I thought he was going to drop ‘island boy’ in there
🔥🤘😍
Por estas cosas sigo vivo osii
Sucks!
Después de tanto tiempo :"3
Tell me if I got it https://youtu.be/5sGOr9DJ9XM
What vinyl to get?? Black, orange, blue, red, or ice????
The peppers are ripe again
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Guitarrista eterno Red Hot Frusciante. Quarteto ideal de volta!
Frusciante.
Caraca! Bom demais
Not bad. Besides the guitar tone it sounds like this could have been on "By the way"
That drop at the end gave me actual chills
"the fantastic four"
The boys are back!   Classic Californication vibe.   Love it.

RHCP is baaaaaack, bitches
Will Ferrell's a fair drummer!
The Complete Wario Apparition-https://youtu.be/w6_uX74wjVo
It's Interesting that the older bands dropping new tunes and albums that have been quiet for years.... sound much better than most new and younger bands that have completely missed what melody and passion looks and sounds like...  For me, that's the difference between understanding what playing an instrument and in a band is... Compared to depending on computers to do everything for you.... Including being an artist.... Doesn't fly so well...
Waiting for the album!
Aiii...ele voltou ♥️♥️♥️! Viúva de John assumidaaaa♥️♥️
I didn't think I'd live to see Frusciante back at rhcp I'm crying, come to Mexico 🥺
Vuelve frusciante y todes 😍 viendo esto. 🤣
My soul sings for the harmony your band has, your band never looses the rhythm
Will Ferrell smashing drums love it !!
Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end It's been a long time and you nеver know when Waitin' on another black summer to end [Verse 3] Crack the flaming whip A-sailin' on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  [Chorus] Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
INCREIBLE!
I saw this song in the recommended music and said "Oh, didn't know rhcp did this song, let's hear it", after I've finished it I saw the comments saying that they still keep being the same as in the past, I watched how old the video was and it said "14h ago", and I was like "Oh... I'm dumb". Beautiful song guys! 😍✌❤
Legends!!!!! News: Former Atlantic Recording Artist Ill Biskits become a sensation years after their original release... A golden era of Hip Hop classic that should have been in the 90s... Who knew!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_mJhrzTA_8
Frusciante tone is unique......Very good return....
How sick would it be to have Josh and John play together sometime, I hope Josh isn’t gone forever, he’s a good kid.
Crazy to think that John was on deaths door over 20 year’s ago. Here is he today, still jamming. The doctors said if he hasn’t been brought in for help he would died within 48 hours.
yes!
rama lama bama flama Califor-this sucks.
Nunca decepcionam manoo ♥️
Ctmre como los amo😭
No paro de escucharla . Q bien m callo está canción justo recuperando me del covid . Gracias Red hot chili peppers. Son parte del soundtrack de mi vida

Coming to Orlando!!!!!
RHCP FOR EVER...
Anthony Kiedis: takes one trip to Irelend, comes back with an accent
I am very happy and excited, and I agree and identify with all of the positive, loving comments about RHCP, and the how they have affected people's lives. RHCP is the root of all my musical identity.   But I also have to ask why Anthony is singing in a bad Irish accent at multiple points in the song 😂
Фрушанте! Можно было только мечтать! Теперь - вместе вперёд и до конца! )
i love it
This is my favourite lifetime band! Promise that you will make music until the end of time? Your music means a lot to this world! Thank you! Thank you!! Love you so much! Greetings from Brazil!!!
Porn stache and mullet. Classic
ThE MaGic Is BaCk 🌺💥🪐❤️
Long Live Chili Peppers 🌶🎶
Tantos años han pasado y los Peppers siguen con su esencia!! Y el regreso de John Frusciante!! Excelente!! Saludos!!
The only band from their era still coming out with amazing songs. They are doing something very right.
“I’ve been waiting”
Love them but this is pretty boring and nothing special same old sound which is not a bad thing......it’s safe.....still wonder what they would of become with Navarro. They were going in some a fresh different sound
Q obra de arte! Simplesmente apaixonada😍😍
Grande, Diego Verdaguer❤️
I love you, guys!
Gracias por todo. Los amo
John is good! Anthony- this the look you’re going with? Hillbilly porn star.
Essa música tem stadium arcadium, by the way e blood sugar sex magik
Esto es un milagro 💖

Simplesmente Red hot...
this song goes very hard  love from Japan 🗾 I wish you all so well it's unreal
Words can’t describe the excitement… so glad I was able to get the purple and gold vinyl before they sold out
John Frusciante is God
Love it! John Frusciante is one of my all time favorite guitar players and an integral member of RHCP.
👏👏👏👏🇺🇾
OMG
Larga Vida a Los Peppers con El Retorno del Más Esperado la puta madre !!!! #RedHotChiliFrusciante
Wow, so good! Excited to have em all back together again.  They're producing straight up Magik. Can't wait for the full album.
John is GOD .
John just picking right up where he left off in Stadium Arcadium. I had forgotten how much I missed his signature tone!
What a pleasant surprise to find this on the notifications list. Loved the music and the MV
Top de mais esse som 💗💗💗
https://youtu.be/Taf-y74yhUU
Gracias RHCP gracias Jhon
Excellent!  Welcome from new Mr. Anderson's of rock!👏👏👏👏🤟🎊🎉🎉
Uy yo amooo😻🥰🥰🥰
fuck there getting old..i remember under the bridge like it was yesterday.
Can Kiedis get a normal fucking haircut already lmao
C é doido o John tocou para krl, a musica ficou incrível, os outros mandaram bem para krl tbm
Josh will always be remembered in the history of the peppers, but it’s real nice to have John back :)  Love you guys. Never stop doing what you do best 🤘🌶
jojoref
Guys, where's the Shampoolio cameo ?
JOHN IS BACK!!!🥰
I didnt knew that Zacarias Tercero is now singing in RHCP LIKED THE SONG
OMG OMG OMG OMG *0*
It always gives me chill to see a notification from the peppers <3 larga vida pepperonis!
Yes!!!!!!!!! A new album from RHCP, this winter is officially one of my favourite periods of music since the 80's. RHCP, Korn, Sabaton, Muse, Scorpions, Volbeat, and the best album of the 21st century so far: Senjutsu by Iron Maiden and many more. Here's hoping more good music will come from the rock and heavy metal scene of 2022.
John is better than ever.
14 hrs 1.8 million views, how are there videos trending higher when the numbers aren’t even close???
I've been waiting ❤❤❤
Omg thanks. You are like 4 sons of god. Especially John!!
Impressionante como não perde a essência ❤️
Psychic spies from china on the dark side of the moon.
I really hope this has 1M 👍🏽 and 💯M views soon. I can’t wait to see them at the Concert in Charlotte,NC  on Sep. 1
Spiritual ❤️
The guitar is back! Now all that's left is for that horrible mustache to go away
Wait is this song new? TBH I didn't know the band was still around
Amazing
I love you so much Anthony, Flea, John and Chad.. and I love this so much !!! thanks for this new song. This new music of yours is now my soundtrack for year 2022 :)
It's always too long in between RHCP albums. They are the only artist I must have a physical copy of their music. Already ordered my CD an concert tickets. 💯❤️
não podia esperar menos de vcs, todo o sentimento envolvido em cada nota, cada melodia! estão de parabéns
I just can say THANK YOU RHCP !
I'm glad to see that John's back in the band.
I’ll see ya’ in Le Stade de France in July 2022… I’m so excited !!!! 😆🤘 see you in Black Summer 😉
Muito boa, muito bom também ver o retorno do John
Awesome!!!
I was here👇👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/S6dEPEKAR1w
My older sister gives this a thumbs up. 😂
Been a Chili Peppers listener since I found them in 1984. It's ridiculous I'm 63 now. Saw them in Pittsburgh around 1990 or so with Pearl jam and Smashing Pumpkins and I got stuck in the mosh pit. Thought I was gonna die
ありがとう
Tnx a lot for this new amazing song.
It's pure beauty
Esse som ta incrível RHCP é a melhor banda!!!
Phoenix Suns 🥰🥰🥰
Os caras mandam bem demaaaaaais 🤘
New Classic!
Such a beautiful tune. Majestic
the prodigal son returns   thank you josh
God save the Peppers
Coisa de uns 20 anos atrás, eu era uma criança fascinada por RHCP. As músicas favoritas, os clipes favoritos da TV aberta, e até mesmo a primeira vez que meus pais deixaram eu ver TV até tarde, foi quando exibiram um show deles não lembro em que canal. De uns tempos pra cá, eu não tinha mais  paciência pra qualquer música que fosse deles, nem mesmo as clássicas, como se já tivessem dado no saco. Abri esse vídeo por curiosidade, e imediatamente, senti aquela energia nostálgica de infância. Ver essa formação de volta com um som novo e ao mesmo tempo tão familiar,  é como se o passado me abraçasse com as boas lembranças que tive daqueles tempos.
Really good surprise to hear you with a new song. Really good !!... What a nice pleasure. Many thanks ;)
Imagine this album have the same energy of BSSM
im very glad and thankful John is back, im so happy
THANK YOU SO MUCH RHCP!!!!!!!
chili peppers making proper tunes for first time in 15 years. and the perfect album name of course.
Sin desmerecer el trabajo de Klinghoffer éstos últimos años, es la pieza que le faltaba a la banda. La esencia, el alma de esa guitarra y la garra de John Frusciante. Es increíble volverlos a ver juntos. Pensé que ya no volvería a la banda. Pero aquí los tenemos otra vez.  Hacían mucha falta los RHCP!!!!  Puta madre !!!!!!
Gets better everytime I listen to it  These guys never lose their cool 😎
🔥 good job fellas!
Meh.
RHCP Es espectacular, que nos duren toda la vida amigos.
❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!
Good old peppers ❤️
I unintentionally screamed when Frusciante showed up
Blood Sugar was my bible as a young guitar player, nice to hear you again John, can't wait to hear this record!
🇧🇷
Do Caralho 💪💪💪💪
Pense que JF regreso jajajaja
Add in rock band 4
Caralho, com todo respeito, Josh, mas, quando é o Frusciante na guitarra, vc percebe logo! Esses riff's tem cara, tem nome, tem personalidade. PQP
My son and I have been waiting for this, and when it uploaded today he was like "Anthony Keidis has picked up an Irish brogue inflection" and I was like "yeah, but that's cuz he CAN."  Thrilled to hear from you boys--worth the wait... I'm ready for April Fool's now!!
👑 JOHN FRUSCIANTE - RETURN OF THE KING  👑
New tunes, same vibes. Brb. I'm crying over how beautiful this song is and the nostalgia it brings. 😭❤
Manso power!!!!  Musicalmente bestiales
Дедушки
Socorrooooo não consigo parar de ouvir essa música kkkkk
Amazing
Fuck yeah 🔥🤯
Can someone please talk about how he’s pronouncing certain words in this tune? Sailor? China? Moon? What’s going on?
Josh was amazing and did a great job... but man it's so good to have Frusciante back. It just feels right
John frusciante 😎
I'm pretty sure this song Is a purple and blue Tye Dye shirt in audio form.
🥰🥰🥰
Is this a sea shanty? Either way I like it
I think this track won't be a top song like Californication, Give it away, Dani California and other classics, this for sure... Anyway it works, and finally it sounds really Red Hot, John is back and you can hear it, but I expected something more. Btw, good song
2:36 que macizo
Isso que é RHCP!! The 4 together ❤️
it feels like great times are coming....thank you Peppers!
Oh John… we missed you
Is this that forgotten song from Stadium Arcadium? Just kidding, love it!
Would have fit perfectly in the Big Lebowski soundtrack
John back and Flea wearing a sarape? Life is goood !!!!!
Never ever a guitarrist carried a band so hard. The last albums without John were not the RHCP
I don’t even know what to say  This is awesome man
will ferrell always killin it on the drums
caramba continuam bons sempre.
Soy yo o en el 3:44 se oye como si llegara un whatsapp?
I love this song and I'll love your future album
Clipe absurdo de lindo! Música nem se fala! RHCP na sua melhor fase! ❤️‍🔥
Si.
Daddy has still not lost his stache
🙌😁😍
Los amo :') tan sólo escuché la canción y me reinicié.
Well it’s not their best single, not super impressive for a first single (Dark Necessities or Monarchy of Roses were better imho), I feel the Klinghoffer era is still a little bit in the air.  But I’m just excited to see them back again and can’t wait to hear more! 😍
Great song and Im glad to see uncle Rico is now fronting a band!
good because with pepper?
In these crazy and dark times, this single has managed to make my day! THIS is the essence of the RHCP and takes me back to the glory days of Stadium Arcadium. Love the song and can't wait to see you guys live in concert in Cologne this summer! 😍🌶️🔥
❤️
Nope.  Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  The greatest.
I love so much, RHCP!
Good ol Chad
a little bit boring
love this shit🔥🔥🔥
love these guys have been listening to them since I was a kid. frusciante has definitely always brought that magic and its great to see him back. anthony never ceases to outweird everyone somehow lml i love dude and i get he always has a different hair style but he lowkey look like a pedophile here lmao
Top tier band ish ..
Hooray, RHCP alive!
Super guys! Give will!
Last time RHCP sounded like this, life was a much simpler.
Brabo! Mt Foda.
I love this ❤️
This song is the tits broski..
The best from the west 🤘
You make me feel like it's 90-s and everything is still yet to happen  🤧😭
so is rhcp 99% mexican fanbase now or what lml
Increíble! Intacta la esencia de los Peppers, después de tantos años tocando y que sigan haciéndolo...que nunca nos falte su música...feliz de escucharlos nuevamente!!!
That came unexpected! They came back to the roots
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 VOLVIERON!!!!!
Lo mejor
U jbt kakva stvarcina posle sto godina 💪🏻☝🏻👌🏻
Thanks for bringing John back!!!!!
Thank god for letting us hear this lineup again. Thank you guys, you are the most beautiful.
Ничего нового👎
Parece que não envelheci que ainda é sequencia de Stadium arcadium  Tô tão feliz pela volta do john que vou fazer mais uma tattoo pra rhcp 👀💖
The Peppers are back! The world is not beyond salvation
Good to see you again guys ! 🤘🏻🔥
Джон вик на гитаре ,хорош!
Volvieron con todo cada vez me gusta mas el tema. Va a ser un gran disco este. Del lado de john se van a destacar los efectos que va meter.
That solo at 1:52 is simply mesmerizing. John Frusciante is legendary.
JOOOOOOOOOHHHNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so they gonna tell me this came out in 2022??? I refuse to believe it. Nope. This is from the Californication B side. He's even talking bout China.... WHY AM  I CRYING????
Viva rhcp!!♡
Wow low budget video :D
God I love Frusciante❤️
Just... powerful
Really cool they got Will Ferrell to play the drums in this video.
I'm crying loudly, I love RHCP and I love them more when Frusciante is in the band, this album will be huge, I haven't doubs about it, DUDE THERE IS FRUSCIANTE WITH THE BAND  Love you Anthony Love you John Love you Flea Love you Chad Love you Legends  BTW a big shoutout to those amazing guitars who were with the band and shared their music and love with us Slovak, Sherman, McKnight, Marshall, Tobias, Navarro and Klinghoffer  ❤
LOS AMO TANTOO♡
Vamo Fruciiii que vuelta carajo!!!💪💪
AMO VOCES VELHOTES MALUCOS DO MEU CORAÇÃO
They're back!!
Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome! Hoping this time John's back for good...
I don't understand the need to auto tune every singers vocals these days. Kinda sad to see it happen to RHCP. Cool song though.
JOHN IS BACK 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎵✌🏿🔝.  Great track guys 😍
Whoa. Actual music??? In 2022???
the first 3 seconds in and frusciante has decimated me yet again. So glad he's back, cannot wait for the album
This band is immortal, the Anthony and Flea's friendship transcends the love space time!!! Simply amazing! 🤟🏻🇧🇷
This.. is.. AMAZING!! My favorite band is BACK!! This sounds great! Ready for the album and tour!!
I see RHCP, I click like
Damn!  Anthony is 59 and that dude is shredded like a low fat pork sandwich!  Take care of your self and reap the rewards it looks like. Be well, everyone!
🙄 BORING
<3
Frusciante is back... goosebumbs❤‍🔥
Yessssssssssssss
Will ferrell in the drums
My favorite band of all time. I'm a huge fan. So ecstatic to see John Frusciante back. Love this song
Red Hot Irish Peppers
does anyone else feel like this song vies Slow Cheetah vibes? ❤️🖤
I love this band but the truth is thier albums and songs have been boring and just kinda sucked
The best doing the best 🔥🔥🔥🔥
There is just no comparison when frusciante takes the helm.
In the first few seconds of the song, you can already feel how John poured all his personality into the guitar riff... Damn, it's good to have John back to the band!
Antonio haceme tuya porfa
Amaziiiiiiiiiiing
Anthony Kiedis' transformation into Iggy Pop is nearly complete. And also...fucking John Frusciante...fuck yes.
essa música transmite a vibe do stadium arcadium, melancolia e solos de explodir o coração ! bem vindo de volta frusciante é um honra ter você conosco novamente ! vida longa ao rhcp <3
Esto es IMPECABLE
I've heard it a few more times, it's like a pop song. Middle of the road crap. I have a ticket to see them play live in Glasgow on 1st July, i do not want to see them perform live anymore
u guys are awesome i love it
Bom de mais. Mesmo eles velhos, eu espero ver eles tocarem por mais alguns anos ae.  Umas das melhores banda que existe.
Amazing
The fact the John Frusciante is still alive blows my mind..
No me parece la gran cosa... pero es mejor esto a cualquier canción nueva de ese estupido genero llamado Mierdaton...
Gracias por brindarnos su hermoso trabajo lleno de amor 💞💚🙏🤘💘🥰 desde siempre y para siempre red hot!!!
Love Will Farrel
Que energia boa. Eles totalmente sintonizados. Que bom que voltaram com tudo!
Alhamdulillah.. Bersyukur atas nikmatmu ya ALLAH.  YEAAAAAAAHHHHH
Didn't like it at first very much now love it and can't stop blasting it in my house can't wait to see what the rest of the album holds
The wait was worth it, stadium arcadium vibes
Tears in my eyes waiting so long for this
red hot at its essence, thanks guys for the music.
OK song but jeez Anthony...that vocal affectation needs to go lol.
Percibo que el tema esta orientado a la maldita pandemia y los momentos mas ocursos que pasamos durante estos 2 últimos años. Excelente musicalización, video, fotografía, y el solo de John es imponente, acompaña de sencillez y emotividad.
Ci vediamo a firenze
Yaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
waooo Anthony Frusciante Flea Chad increíbles suenan genialmente maravillosos🤗😇😍😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😊😘😘😘quiero verlos en concierto me muero bien muerta😊
Classic RHCP. A welcome return to top form.
envelhecendo como vinho
❤️
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
They were waiting for frusciante to grow his hair out again
Игги Поп отлично сыграл!
John Frusciante!
I was expecting a California somewhere in the lyrics tbh lol
Bien ce riff sur la fin,ça me rappelle...merci!
LEGENG ♥️👽
Aleluya Hermanos! volvió el "alma  mater" de los RHCP
from the first second you will understand 🌶🌶🌶
Un like prima di sentirla, una garanzia come sempre.
Incrível como as músicas do RHCP trazem uma vibe boa, na maioria das músicas que eu escuto eu sinto uma sensação de nostalgia ou de paz e felicidade, sinceramente... as músicas do Red hot são como se fosse um remédio prá mim❤️🌶️.   🤘🏼🤘🏼🇧🇷
seja bem vindo de volta Red Hot Chili Peppers. Quando eu estava nos meus 27 anos, o Red Hot Chili Peppers trouxe tantas lembranças incríveis para mim❤ Meu gosto musical literalmente cresceu com eles🎵 Essa música e as boas notícias do Red Hot Chili Peppers fizeram meu dia, tenho certeza que milhões de amantes da música vão ouvir essa música por um muito tempo, obrigado pessoal trazendo o que nós e o que a música precisa 😊 Eu coloquei essa música no meu coração ao lado de outras músicas do Red Hot Chili Peppers. Eu sou a verdade.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-Ojloj3qE0&feature=share
This song is awesome! Can’t wait for the album!

Literalmente llore a la mitad del solo de John ... Amo a este ser csm, RHCP for ever.
Tellement le kiffe ♥️♥️
You guys have no idea how much you all made me so happy. Years of WAITING for these four together again ❤️ great song. Everything is PERFECT. I can't wait to hear the whole album.   Frusciante, welcome back. I Love you so much 😭🥺❤️   PLEASE FUCKING COME TO BRAZIL OR I'll die!!
Que gran banda los red hot  pasan los años y siguen vigentes haciendo muy buenas canciones
The drummer looks like Will Ferrell in Stepbrothers.
Awesome to see John back. But I really hope they explore new stuff the way they did for The Getaway.
Настоящие Перцы только с Фручанте.
Return of the king 👑
Anthony is a Jedi now?
Gonna see ya’ll in July! Let’s go!!
Frusciante está de vuelta, señores! <3
"You think I do all this Crossfit to wear a shirt?" -Anthony probably  Super excited for the new album this sounded great
Just once I want them to substitute Will Ferrell for Chad in one of their videos and then just never acknowledge it.   Great to see John back!
Good to have you back, John
Frusciante brought back the guitar magic, RHCP feels old school and fresh at the same time
Great to hear that classic rhcp aug chord before the chorus again
Que vibe Californication ❤️
Frusciante is back! Está de vuelta el mejor guitarrista de los últimos 30 años, a disfrutar!
I lika da peppa
How about black chili red peppers? This proofs that Fruscinate is a soul of this band.
still
So happy I cried😭❤
There is no need to record songs like this in 2k22 you can do better
Back on top form
These pops have gotten old!
Temón!
no wayy :D
I think we all just really missed them
I really like the vocals on this, in fact everything about this song sounds so good.  Can't wait for the album.
this is gonna slap live
Fantastic!!!!
Yeah they need John back it’s made them sound fresh again!
This album is gonna save the world
I'd never bet that frusciante would age better than the guys
Grande Red Hooooooot <3
John's brought back the magik and then some ! Guys if you see this thank you for the many years of killing it and rocking our souls ! And dear John 🥺 welcome home sir we've all missed you and your incredible energy and soul 😭❤️
Nice comeback track !!
Will Ferrell! SWEET!
Shit. Im underwhelmed. Never thought I would ever be regarding these guys, but somethings just not there in this production. I have all of their releases and am a massive RHCP fan and have seen em live many times, but this is off the mark, sorry. Im going to put on "The Getaway" now to hear them at their maturing best........I still love ya......but it sounds like stuff we already have from these guys..........;)
Welcome back, John.
Very average
can't wait to see this live, frusciante will kill it
never lose quality ♥️
Yaaawwwwnnn.
Suena a red hot chili peppers ☺️
I am so confused… is this some kind of joke? 🥲
Rhcp have helped me for 20 years now
And your Love 💓
Parece que estou vivendo um sonho, sem acreditar que isso tá acontecendo. Música maravilhosa 👏🏾🥰
I liked the guitar from 00:45 to 00:55. Et voilà.
Durrrrk suyyyyd of the mooooon
Awesome guys thank you so much for your work.
Top
Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeej
Alv no que Diego Verdaguer había fallecido?
Sayyyyluuuur
Very tasty.
Im glad this came out on my birthday
They like to use Desecration Smile & Wet Sand transition to Chorus...
Didn’t know Will Ferrel was the drummer crazy
Classic Chili Peppers
God... and people still bash on AC/DC for ALWAYS. SOUNDING. THE SAME.
Just listened to it first time… I can tell this ones gonna be huge
Bellissima, grandi e grazie per essere tornati
The sound of 15 years ago, thank you very much Josh for allowing us to witness this! *
Verry Niceee😎😎😎😎
Larga vida a John Frusciante 🤟🏾🎸

Que música FODA!!!
Un millon en 13 horas increible
❤🔥🌶
Will Ferrell is so talented , he`s an actor and the drummer of Red Hot Chili Peppers.
I'm watching the video and thinking to myself "It looks like they filmed this in the Volume that they made the Mandalorian in". Then I see Deborah Chow directed it, so they probably did.
Black summer in the middle of the white winter. Best.
I feel in my bones that will be amazing album
goddamn that autotune artifacting is absolutely atrocious
They are like U2 in the fact they can release any old crap and their fans think it’s amazing.
rhcp = LA vibes
YES!
Still in the case.2022. Respect.Love.
Nossa Velho. Que notificação mais especial. ❤
Man its awesome to have John back🔥🔥🔥
Have anybody seen orange is the new black?!? We got pornstache here!
Моя самый главный фанатос оф ред хот острый перец
This guys never disappoint, another hit.
many of us dream of seeing Frusiante back in the band, this moment is called happiness
sounds like an ai generated rhcp song lol
Soft
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whosoever should believe in Him would not perish but have everlasting life John 3 16 🙂 💙 Jesus died for all yall out here and loves u wherever youre at including u RHCP! God has great plans for all yall be sure to spread love joy peace positivity wherever u go be a blessing to others and you will be blessed simple as that!❤❤❤❤
Gracias por devolvernos algo de necesaria esperanza.
John welcome back. Rhcp are complete again!
Thats crazy not even one dislike!!! Only the red hot Chilli peppers can do that!
Temazo, se lo puse a mi abuela, después le mostré el tema.
Why he sound Irish? Get track though
Forgetting man is practically 60 and ripped...hell of a grandpa lol
♥Jon Fuchante
Иш, как выводють! Душевна...
John Frusciante hasn’t lost a fuckin thing. This is so good 🤘🤘🤘. I feel like I’ve been on pause for over a decade waiting for this .
I have absolutely missed THIS sound of theirs....it just relaxes me with their old school sound....loving this!!!❤
oh well.. they got old,, didn't they.  I think the song is a bit boring.
AK looking like the Tiger King.
I was born in 92. I grew up listening to rhcp, and I'm always happy to see when new material comes out. They've never lost what makes them the rhcp... I hope they never do. It'll be such a sad day when they finally hang it up. Until then, I'll keep listening and loving their material. By the way, breaking the girl, snow,  etc.. I love it all.. They're icons, and next Friday will be my 30th birthday... I hope that if/when I have kids, they'll love rhcp too
What tha Fuq is going on with Anthony and that porn/cop stache? 🥴
What is the signing about, Red Hot Chilli Pirates??? Are they from Cornwall now.
oh how I’ve missed the invisible ninja fighting
Still fucking got it
Yay..... more pop bullshit..... RHCP have sucked since Californication.
Still makes my dog howl when I play it , some things never change ! But , that hairdo is killing me , and yes son , we see your guns , don't taze me bro !
Jesus is back in game again. JUST WOW.
1:51 Frusciante is back!!!
vasco
ME VUELVO LOCOOOOOOOOOOOO
That guitar solo gives me those Stadium Arcadium vibes ..
Aguante los red hot bo!
Fantastic. Having John back is great. It’s a shame they didn’t keep Josh. It would’ve worked fine with 2 guitarists.
Absolutely fucking quality
Anyone else get first dibs on the vinyl?
John não abriu muito o bico nesta música
MEU DEUS! Esses quarto são perfeito juntos!!! Meu Deus!!!!! Como estou empolgada e animaaaaada com isso tudo!!! Quanta Emoção!!!!
The voice, the groove, the tone, the bass and the beat. Total eargasm. I could just eat this song up like a cupcake right now.
John speaks from his soul with his guitar. There is nothing else like it. I've missed him in the band a lot
❤️
All my videos are in this video)
Vamos todavía cheeeeeee 🎸💗😍
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH VOLVIERON! LARGA VIDA A LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!! ♡
this is a cool tune to chill to...   love the creativity of the video too...  I have always quietly thought to myself that Anthony clearly takes great care of his body...   I just wish he'd refocus some of his efforts towards his hair cuts...   as an international rock star, I just think he could do much better and look like the rock star that he clearly is by a more sensible hair style.. my humble opinion..not trying to hate on him at all...  just think for a mega star... he shouldn't have the hair cut that looks so ridiculous.
Es como ver a los dioses regresando al olimpo
been rocking the peppers since 86
Since I was twelve years old, I've been waiting and celebrating for every single.  Red Hot Chili Peppers for a lifetime. From Brazil
Lets goooooo
mef af
I♥️ rhcp
Love your videos!! Everyone be safe out there ❤️
The it is happy red hot chili peppers thank you
i miss Josh
awesome song
Now is as good a time as ever to remind you that, in addition to being unlawfully cringey and lame as hell, these people are pedophiles and abusers.
What year is this
good to see techno viking is doing well
La espera terminó / The wait is over 😀
Back to the '90s 🤘
omg 🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️‍🩹
Good guitar sounds without being plugged in
wow. john sounds great. the song had to grow on me...i also think their songs got to such an amazing and mature place with josh klinghoffer so i wouldn't say this outright better than anything they did with him... but the familiarity of that classic sound with john??? incredible.
Just great job, legendary.
Vince Neil could take some body and health pointers from Anthony!
Cadê os BR ?🤘
Ele dançando igual o techno viking
I've been listening to it for about 50th time in a row and don't want to stop. Feel so happy to see them together again.
Will Ferrel is still the best drummer after all these years!
This is what we need..... Tired of these something something evolving.... Too much evolution
Me encanta .valió la pena esperar
GRANDES!!! Ojalá la vengan a tocar en México!!
Love this song been listening to a lot of RHCP lately and when I heard they had a new song out I knew now why I was listening to a bunch of their old stuff.
I was 8 years old the first time I heard you. I'm 30 now and 22 years just made me love you more and more.
that riff has cured my covid
volvió un grande
Sigo sin creerlo mis queridos chicos, casi me da un infarto... Que vivan los Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶️!!!
HOLY FUCK A NEW SONG
chorei, musica boa do krl
Fuck yeah!!!
Brazil🇧🇷🤘
I've missed you guys
Frusciante de volta . Maravilhoso
So good to see this guys with John again
Hope this album is just as good as The Getaway, absolutely love that album.
Anthony! Chad!! Flea!!! Johnny!!!!  This is RHCP!!!!!
Una puta locura la identidad de estos muchachos! De las mejores bandas de mi vida.
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK MOTHERF4KERSSSSSSSS
Por fin música diferente!
RHCP no es nada sin Jonh God Frusciante larga vida al Rey
This is music, this is art. They are like wine. Kiedis is 62 years old! WOW. These are artists who have kept their essence, their voice.
so good
GUAU QUE LINDO VER ESTA NOTIFICACIÓN ✌🏼❣️ GENIOS...
Pinche silverio
Like!
Anthony looks like a 70s porn star
Hot, hotter, Red Hot Chili Peppers. 😍
Legends ✨🌶
Welcome home John.
LONG LIFE TO THE RHCP 🌶 🌶 🌶 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU GUYS THIS SUMMER🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Un “freakin” believable! How do they do it.
c'est de la bombe bb
Пишаюся, тим, що картинку для відео малював Українець, Сергій Машевський 🇺🇦
Good fucking song! Hello from Poland!
So I guess Anthony is Irish now
Swietny kawalek ❤️
Hillel would be proud
Nice to see Will Farrell still killing those drums
00:48 feeling happy to see Keane Reeves here @RHCP

Great job on this one especially John, got a cool Hendrix vibe to it, "Valleys of Neptune," to be exact.
Yes, thank you, gave me goose bumps! Today is a good day. Big love to RHCP :-)
This hits like a warm hug from an old friend you haven't seen in ages. So happy to have Chili's back again!
Can't wait for the new album!! This song shows us why we love this unique RHCP sound, great work guys👍👍👍
Qué grandes lptm... Valió esperar cada maldito segundo. Genios.
1:52 uffff, great guitar solo!

John is back! 🤩🤘🏼🎸
Jouhn frusciante😂🤘

Johns guitar skills were greatly missed
que coisa perfeita, john me surpreende cada vez mais...
john aşkım birtanemmm ömrümmm çok özlemişim seni.
FRUSCIANTE TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <3
Why didn't you mention California at all in the lyrics? This is a let down.
Nice, smooth, perfect. A bit too nice, smooth and perfect. I know that "Knock me down", "Good time boys" or "Under the bridge" I will remember forever. This one surely not. Anyway, the band still in a good shape.
Greeting from Slovakia. Keep rockin
Anthony has always been the weak link in this band and the main reason why I never got into them. What is with the weird accent on the verse vocals.
same drum beat as californication
Who else got unexpectedly emotional?
JOJO RÉF
Aqui é Brasil ... Red hot hoje e sempre !  ..
Me alegraron el día, el mes, el año, la década. Gracias Red Hot. Thanks RHCP, from Argentina
Já vi o clipe umas 15 vezes. RHCP é a banda da minha vida, fã desde os 11 anos
É incrível como eu gosto de todas as músicas do RHCP de primeira!
Deja vu..
¡Lo volvieron a hacer! ❤️🌶
Dios como amo a Frusciante
Glad so glad to see John  Fruciante
Sounds like they got their inspiration from stairway to heaven by led zep
he returned
So awesome to hear new RHCP!
Como me gusta ver todos estos comentarios de fans de los Red Hot !! Un abrazo a todos !! 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
John: "For me, this record represents our love for, and faith in each other.” hence the album named "unlimited love"  Love the ending of John's solo how its electronic influenced
NICE!!!!!
Nothing
Mmm hendrix
Anthony Kiedis is trying too hard....his look....his dancing....his flexing....uggh.  The song might have potential otherwise.  Nice guitar grooves.
Woooow👀💪
Love it
Od kiedy Jasiek powrócił i po tym kawałku, jestem spokojny o formę RHCP. Czekam do 1 kwietnia i w ciemno biorę całe dwupłytowe wydanie🤘
I'm 16 and fell In love with yalls music and sound at 14 I've listened to every song and been waiting for this ❤
MEU CORAÇÃO TA QUENTINHO <3
Welcome Back, John!!!
Love 💗 it 👍. Sounds very Stadium Arcaduimy 🔥
Autênticos, sempre. E que maravilha o Frusciante de volta! Vida longa RHCP!
0:56 Nice to see Will Ferrell trying different kinds of art.
Как же посторел Билан...
The video could have been a bit more terrific, considering the impact of this band in music history. However, this is an authentic RHCP song. Can’t wait to listen to this band next hits.
Ну что сказать, с первого аккорда узнаешь, кто это. Перцы в строю, перцы жгут, перцы дают хиты. С нетерпением ждём новый альбом и тур. Просто представить, как ребята будут играть это лайв
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
John being back is like discovering fire all over again
Never liked these guys, especially Anthony.
from russia with love-to you!
oh man....that sound......no mistaking these guys........
Поразительно что можно 40 лет играть одну и ту же музыку и при этом оставаться на супер высоком уровне
John literally hasn't aged at all since he left the band. Wow
Sucks....
RED HOT CHILLI PAPAS
Nice to see Will Ferrell can still jam out!
Time to hang it up.
Why is that the RHCP always make me feel like I’m 17 and I’m in the best summer of my life watching the sunset?
i miss the energy from 1996 or near there  keep going rhcp  love you  i m 1976 living in slovenija  stay  strong and  in health
JOHN IS BACK 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Esto debería de estar en tendencias numero 1
одна из редких в сегодняшнее время музыка которая радует...
Not really feeling this hope the rest of the album is good
Speechless
Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Keanu Reeves, and John Malkovich might make a funny video like Beastie Boys Fight for Your Right Revisited IMO.
What's with Anthony's accent?
Inoxidables !!!!!. Aguante los Red Hot!!!. Ojala vuelvan a Argentina pronto.
They hired John Oates as the new lead singer….nice!
Ayyyyy ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rapaz, nao tava esperando nada e me surpreendi, musica bem boa!
Great Comeback with a New Sony🤘🏼🌶❤️‍🔥
esa bataca suena como la del album califirnication y me encanta por que en el disco pasado  le falto muchisimo punch a esa bateria e chad smith me alegra que con el regreso de john  el sonido de los rhcp vuelva como hace unos 15 años
a bit boring for me but I liked the guitar solo very much, Frusciante is always great to listen to
Finos Señores hoy volvemos a ver John Frusciante
Ya'll should have stayed gone. sucks ya'll come back with lip singing and autotune everybody knows (will at least i do that ya'll are not really playing thoes instroments #CANCELTHECHILIPEPPERS #MYRIGHTTOFREEDOMOFSPEECH
GOATS
Superb song, the greatest band that ever existed.... "get it on"
Keren 😍 panjang umur RHCP jaya selalu. im from Indonesian Medan
Vida longa, Red Hot!!! s2s2s2s2s2s2s2s2s2s2 YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
With John Frusciante on lead guitar they never lost their mojo, I can’t wait to see them live in Chicago this summer !
The solo gave me nostalgia chills, never felt that before
Starts out like a song for an Irish wake, great stuff but isn't all their stuff with Frusciante
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al Olimpo xd Como volver a la primera vez escuché su música, el mismo estilo, el mismo espíritu, la misma magia uwu
We missed you, glad you found each other. Your music and alchemy have remained the same!
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Another amazing work by rhcp
We've been waiting. Nostalgia at its finest
They still sound amazing… #9 on trending well deserved!!
It is as though the Gods appeared right when I needed them most and delivered this powerful song from the Heavens. That is what this music is, that theyve always created together. TRANSCENDENTAL
Welcome back, John! Damn I missed him so much
I just busted
nobody will admit how much this sucks. It's comically bad and bland. I'm glad keidis managed to keep from naming states in this one tho, it's progress.
Thank you sooooo much!!!!! I really need this kinda songs ! Its amazing, all the instruments ! You are all legends !!!  The guitar of frusciante 😭 PLEASEEEEEE how he can play like This ?????? Is the master 🙌🏻
VAMOS LA CONCHA DEM IHERMANAAA
Nice this Slow cheetah cover
Me likey
GREATEST BAND ON THE PLANET 🌎  LOVE YOU GUYS LONG TIME 😎
Lets go RHCP WHOOOOO!!
I miss josh
❤❤❤
Amazing 🤩🤩💘
Kalian keren sekali
Who else woke up today saw this video and was like dreams do come true I love it here I wish y'all could make music forever 💞🥰💞🥰💞🥰💞
Como extrañaba un solo de John, leyendas
I was here
This is just what I needed 😊 so happy that John is back, that riff was awesome. This song makes It feel like he never left - also when Anthony took of his shirt you knew it was about to get real 🤣 can’t wait to hear more rhcp 🤘🏼
c'est magnifique! oeuvre d'art! bravo!  flea est demi-dieu, john est dieu! chad le morphée du batteur et anthony, l'oracle de l'olympe. :  )
TE AMO FRUSCIANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RHCP released the first song from their latest album 'Unlimited Love' and it's just LIT as fuck! John Frusciante's return is so very obvious in the lyrics, composition and music arrangements. Such a big day for all the RHCP fans, feels like we are back in the early 2000s, they have kept their soul intact even in such tumultuous times for the music industry where standard has been dropping consistently from last few years. This album should be a chartbuster for sure 😋😋😋
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌🤟✌
John Fucking F r u s c i a n t e ! ! !
Ese solo por Dios! 🔥 gracias por seguir haciendo buena música! 🙌
Their last album was not good. I’m hoping with fruscente back they can recapture the magic. This song doesn’t do much for me.
Excelente vale sigue siendo unos duros
Frusciante looks exactly the same. Dude hasn't aged a bit
Cannot overstate how happy I am to see Johnzie back.! He truly is the the soul of the band
Pretty good.
Sick!   Find someone who holds you as lovingly as Kiedis cupping his goddang mic lol
damn will farrell looking great here
Mientras más escuché está canción más me gusta 😻
Fell in love with the video straight away. I couldn't understand why Anthony was singing in a different accent- sounded so weird but then I loved it  sounds like the band we all love but now it has aged and morphed into this new thing. So familiar but still different. Still new quirks. Still something fresh to behold even after all this time. Littleeaster eggs.   Almost unforgivable that Chad played THAT drumbeat... But then after the 3rd listen you realise that it might be the only beat that could work in this song!? How did he do that???    THEN THE FUCKING CHORUS CAME IN.   HOLY SHIT. EXCUSE ME. IT'S THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD. HOW COULD YOU FOTGET? LISTEN TO IT FLY.  AND THEN THE GUITAR SOLO. JOHN IS BACK. IT'S MR FUCKING FRUSCIANTE.   Stunning phrasing. And the fucking tone sounds just like Stadium Arcadium BUT EVEN BETTER! - Even more refined!  Fleas playing throughout is just gorgeous.    The weird drop before the second chorus is a touch of genius that's missing from modern music. Thank GOD for this band. Still taking risks, still mixing up the structure.    The outro just felt like home.    Oh my God they're back.    They're back.
It has a Slow Cheetah vibe.... Especially in the chorus... Digging it
Too slow and boring to be the first single
Ufffff siguen siendo jodidamente buenos, grande Frusciante!!!!!!!
Damn I've been listening to this song since yesterday all day long haha need some help and need the full album right now!!
at first listen, I wasn't sure about this single. Now after listening to it a couple times...this is definitely a hit. Its is a reintroduction to the old RHCP with new material
como não amar Red Hot? ♥
🤩💥🔥🔥🔥
John’s playing under Anthony’s vocals are equally as powerful as the solos ....Thank God John came back because not only does this band make its best  music with him ...he is in there with the greatest living live guitarists and it’s a very small list!
estoy sorprendido con su nueva canción de Red Hot Chili Peppers los escucho todavía tengo su disco de ellos
Essência que permanece, talentos que não se perdem. Não é atoa que é minha banda favorita! Linda música, surpresa muito boa. Apaixonada
Showwww!!!!!
John is back! Howgh!
Very classy. Must say, to my ears that's the best thing they've done in a while. Welcome back Mr Frusciante.
awebo cabrones, lo mejor que me pudo pasar fue hacerme fan de los RHCP
i love you guys!!
Ojalá ses eterno  Jhon Frusciante .
I can’t wait to see these guys in Vegas this year 🏜
Anthony doesn't pronounce the word ''California''   Anthony be like :              ''How God I made it''
A  M  O  R     I  L  I  M  I  T  A  D  O
A comeback worth the expectations! great sound, great video too, photography on spot!!
Welcome back fruciante 🔥❤️
Life is short—-from  a 90s fan—John my man, don’t leave  us again
Gooooood
Oh that is good !
Waaaw que buena cancion, RHCHP presente en Perú 🇵🇪
Delicinha, hein?!
el solo de Jhon Frusciante en vivo será épico!!!
The man. The myth. The legend. John Frusciante.
Excelente, los amo 😍😍😍
Me encantó
in the good old days..
El regreso de John Frusciante fue lo mejor que le paso a RHCP
John absolutely slays the Gods of music in this!
Great start you fkn legends. ❤❤❤
Fear the stache!
Instantly a classic RHCP song
Welcome back Jhon! <3
Definitely transported me. Great job RHCP!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Guys, you're amazing! John's guitar, Flea's bass, Chad's drums and Anthony's voice give the same unbelievable emotions from 30 years. What a great and unique  rock band!
Horrible…..when did uncle Rico from napoleon dynamite become the lead singer????
Cool love it
It's good to see Frusciante where he belong!!!
: )
fuck i'm crying omg
Почему в Россию не приедут!?
Simplemente increíble, piel de gallina como de costumbre😍🤙🏻
I fucking love you all! God bless you and thanks god for JF bac! I can't even realize yet
Maybe the most uncompromised band of all time
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 JOHN FREAKING FRUSCIANTE killed this

Sonzeira! Equilíbrio e ótima química!
Oh how i missed those guys complete each others.
Fantastic!!!
💥🎸🎶🎸🎶🎸🎶🎸🎶💥
Now that John is back they are the red hot chili peppers again!
They haven’t missed a beat
No puedo creer lo que ven mis ojos. Después de 89 años han regresado. Que bueno es tener de nuevo a los Red Hot. Que gran banda
Estaba pasando por una maldita depresión terrible 😞. Problemas me sobran  Siempre llegan ustedes con su buena música y me vuelven a transmitir esa tranquilidad que tanto me hace falta. Simplemente amo Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤️🙏 Bendiciones para todos ustedes, si se puede siempre pa' delante.
Amazing!!!!! I have always loved this band. Brought me through the darkest times
Ver a Jhon Frusciante con su guitarra y tan entero es como ver a Tobey Maguire en Spiderman No Way Home. Épico
I like the way he pronounce R 😌♥️
Love the mullet too!
Eu não gostei não! Vou ouvir do mais 384 vezes só pra ter certeza 🤣😍
*longest yeah boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ever*
Amazing
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE  Slowed reverb
First rhcp song that's new to me
THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME!
Please come to Argentina
Still rocking the Pedostache for some reason?
So true to the core of their music, yet still so fresh and beautiful. Good god they're some of the best of all time. Love the song so much, keep bringing the soul food!!
When did Sting form a band with Justin Long, Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrell? Not bad.
RHCP and the Foo Fighters are the only bands that has withstand time.
LONGETIVITY
Why does the 1st verse sound like a sea shanty?
John really is Hendrix reincarnate
❤🎵❤
Agora sim, tudo como deve ser, as peças do quebra-cabeça se encaixaram ❤️❤️❤️❤️
MA IO MI EMOZIONO COSÌ PERÒ
Can definitely hear an Irish music influence in Anthonys delivery, Overall you can hear they are moving in a new direction which is so refreshing, glad to hear John back with the boys 🇮🇪🇮🇪
Frusciante 😍😍
Hace 4 años estuve en el Lollapalooza de chile y un dia antes se presento RHCP y me quede con las ganas de verlo y ahora tengo q verlos si o si en mi país seria emocionante ir a un concierto de ellos, no? Frusciante larga vida 🤘
Brought a tear to my eye seeing john jamming again. Much love to flea, anthony, chad and john ❤️
Que vivan los Chili Peppers¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
This is the official comeback of a band that separated 13 yrs ago as far as I’m concerned.   This is the Red Hot Chili Peppers.   Love it!!
Today is my birthday and it feels like i get a one of my best birthday gift! Thanks RHCP for keep making beautiful music! Lanjut terusss
Mexicans got internet?
Why is anthonys voice sound so weird the rest of the band is hella tight though
Slow cheetah vibes
Juro que me salió una lagrima rodando
Simplesmente incrível, não é a toa que é uma das melhores bandas de todos os tempos e a minha preferida ❤️LOVEURHCP
I adore Josh and his riffs but damn it really hits to see John back
Sempre loro ❤
Simplesmente John Frusciante ❤️
The core 4 with John is just a special thing. They can do this for the next 15
Actually good
Nice song
Que coisa estranha, por algum motivo eu senti uma energia "Apache" na sua voz!
These guys are just...... Magic.
Niceeee
Best, wooooooo
That's a damn good song
Seen RHCP live twice in early 2000s, still a great band. Loving the song.
FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!! THESE GUYS ARE TIMELESS!!! Gawd this sounds refreshing!!
EMOTIONAL
this sounds like it was written by an AI program that had listened to every RHCP song ever and was then tasked with writing its own. Chad even recycles the exact drum beat from Otherside. I sincerely hope this is the weakest song on the album, because if this is representative of the quality across the whole thing... that'll be disappointing.
I loved it. You rock , guys.
🔥
John 🔥
Man. 🥲
Vaaaaamos reeeeddddd carajo🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Without a doubt one of the greatest guitar players of all time
Im REEEALLY hoping this is going to be a big Stadium arcadium-era revival.
I'm a big fan of theirs but I would have preferred him to sing badly, autotune cannot be heard
Awesome!!! Great stuff! :)
🤍 Frufruuu... Guitarrada Zen... 🙏🏻😍🐽
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yess yes yes now

That guitar tone 😍

Ayo Lesgo
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end It's been a long time and you nеver know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip A-sailin' on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Anthonys vocals remind me of Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull. Cool vibe on this tune.
These old men have the essence intact!! Let's rock 🍷😎
Wow!!!!!
My inner beast, my shadow, is smiling and dancing right now...and I feel so grateful when I hear you guys play... Cheers !!!
Eu tô completamente viciado nessa música
Just....Thank you

Que música maravilhosa
Awesome as usual!
Dang they stay in shape!
JohnFru💧⚡💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋
Son muy buenos pero ésta canción es más de lo mismo...😴
1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
I agree with everyone here - THIS is the Chili Peppers lineup we grew up on and grew to love. I'm so happy John is back. But I also just wanna say huge shoutout to Josh Klinghoffer for keeping the band alive and kickin' for the past few years. Plus a very special thanks for that killer guitar solo on Dark Necessities! <3
Will Ferrell is such an amazing drummer
0:44 yes. Tears. John I missed you so ♥️
Yep...their last good album was One Hot Minute.   This is awful, let's be honest.
Will Ferrell back in action!!!
sounds like  jefferson airplane somebody to love
Tantos años esperandolos🌹
Thank you so much John for coming back   💃🕺🎼🎶🎵
Fireeee
YEWSSSIT
Hey i like his funny dance shirt off 🤣
Jjajaajaj que feo final tienen los red hot .......está canción es reciclaje de muchos de sus éxitos pasados......ya que busquen su asilo y se internen....solo hacen el ridículo....vergüenza ajena siento.
Yes I'm been waiting, we all have been waiting John 2nd coming. Today is a good day.
See you boys in Denver!
They aren’t RHCP without Frusciante. Happy to see him back.
I’m excited
Best band ever.
CARALEOOOOO🥶🥶
Yeeeeeee, doooooo
Que música!!!!♥️❤️
MEU DEUS É ISSO MESMO
Honestly this was awful. John is such a good guitarist but the lyrics made zero sense and  were fuckin bizarre as shit. Tried some spoken word at the beginning but failed miserably. Waiting on another black summer to end! Sounds like someone is excited to have there song bought out for commercial advertisement.. 🙃 disappointed
Pengen nangis😭 seneng banget!!! Gila akhirnya bisa dengerin dan lihat lagi RHCP terkini! Actually ada John Frusciante lagii 🤩🥺
This is amazing and so glad that John is back 🔥🙌🏻
When did Will Ferrell join the band?
I'M SO SO SO HAPPPPY RN
John Frunsciante SOS el maldito amo!!! 🔥🔥
That guitar tone though.
Vida longa aos Peppers 🤩
Chiners on tha derk side of ther mooooonnnn
This is really good
GRAÇAS A DEUS !! RED HOT ! QUE HONRAAAA !!
LOVING THIS !!!!!!!
OMG THATS AWESOME
Перцы🤘
no tiene ni un sentido
It’s amazing that Will Ferrell keeps so busy as an actor and STILL finds time to play the drums for the chillies! What’s your excuse Kings? Go get it
La esencia no se pierde... bienvenido a casa...
What is Anthony doing with his pronunciation here? He sounds like he's from the 19th century in the verses. Oh and I love it!! Welcome back John!!
John Frusciante + Flannel Shirts = True Love
So happy this is out. I keep listening over and over
Que grata surpresa! Música incrível, obrigada por isso RHCP
Спасибо, Вам, КРАСНЫЕ ГОРЯЧИЕ ОСТРЫЕ ПЕРЦЫ!!! 1000 лайков За себя и за сашку
EU AMO TANTO ESSES 4 JUNTOS
Есть же хорошие певцы!!!
# Black Summer
Time pass, the world changed a lot and RHCP keeps rocking besides everything because when you are the best you are the best. Thanks guys for being part of our lives.

O shape do Tonho 👀
NICE TO SEE YA TOGETHER AGAIZ BOYZZZZZZZZZ
Always the same thing since a Long Time ...maybe it's time to stop.
Por dios como la rompe Jhon Frusciante loco!
Se nota de inmediato el regreso de Frusciante!!!! Súper rola
Well at least he's not singing about anything geographical which is good but now he's singing in some sort of Irish accent. Christ. At least JF sounds good.
No matter how old Anthony is, he will always have the same great voice
Musically I dig it... But can't deal with Kiedis vocals and his 70s porn mustache...
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8Jr81wxcIHF4HC_97er1TQ
this is RHCP sound!!!
😱 OMG
I've never been biggest fan of RHCP but gotta give it to them for still rocking out all these years
La ame tanto es una nueva era de música un nuevo comienzo para los Chili Peppers los amo mucho gracias por todo !!!! 🖤🌶️❤️
John Frusciante 🥵
JOHN, WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH BUDDY
Anthony Kiedis wants to be Iggy Pop so much that he's turning in to him.
cmon the drummer is better than that
I like Anthony’s new accent
being here since I first heard john play under the bridge on TV, been playing for 20yrs now, their music changed my life forever, thnxs guys

Bienvenido Jhon frusciante, desde Bogotá colombia
Boring
Vamos por el top 1 de más escuchadas
With John!!!
The most intriguing aspect of this song is Anthony's diction/enunciation...also Chad looks more and more like Will Ferrell 🤣  Great classic RHCP vibe is still alive and well
DAMN Kiedis is almost 60 and ripped like Brad Pitt in fight club.
Quando o Frusciante apareceu eu quase dei um grito aqui hahahah mto foda!
The mustache….please it has to gooooooooo😂
Thank you💕😍💕
These 4 men paved the way for my love of music growing up, those guitar tones are so nostalgic
Seeing John Fruiscante play alongside them again brings tears to my eyes 😭 the greatest band of all time 🙏🏼

Wow John's back!!
Originality at its very best 💯👍 RHCP completely understands what we want from them  .. Thank you  Love from India 🤎❤🙌
Pretty awesome birthday gift. Thanks for the dope ass single Chili Peppers 👊
18年前、この人達のせいで音楽の道に走って夢破れ、初めて挫折をしりました。 この人達のせいで、15年ひたすら音楽を楽しむことが出来ました。  この人達がいたから今の自分がいて、仲間がいます。 RHCPは、僕の始まりで僕の帰るところです。 おかえり！ジョン フルシアンテ！
Espero poder volverlos a ver en vivo, han formado parte de mi vida desde que era un puberto.
💣💥💣💥💣💥💣💥💣💥
I can't wait to see them in August!!! I knew Frusciante would come back. They are just too good together!
👏👏👏🤟🤟 Ya era hora
anthony looks like a sith of the star wars in this video
Boooo
So happy to see John back with them making music
Will Ferrell is still 🔥 after all these years
Génial. Tout ce dont j’avais besoin. MERCI!
Рад, что ребята вернулись! 💪
🤙🏻🔥🤙🏻🔥🤙🏻🔥
Anthony se volvio nea
When did Uncle Rico take over vocals?
Imagine four kitchen chefs like them four .
From first album till now, Anthony's voice hasn't changed a bit! That's incredible!
🔊💨🤯🎶🎵🤙🏻🔥🔥🔥🤙🏻
Flojo el tema, más de lo mismo.
Larga vida a RHCP
AAAAAAAAAAAA VOLVIERON AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I can hear some Empyrian in this also... if this is the opener I can't wait for the rest of the album...
Te amo flea
Aeeee poha delícia de música
EU TO CHORANDO BRASILLLL
I feel 90s Forever Thanks RHCP..
AEEE CARALHO!!!!!! TKS GUYS!!!!
welcome again Jhon
the one and only RHCP Frusciante, welcome back! it was time to get back on stage !!!
What a ride. I remember  when the lead singer  was  20-something, bare chested and  singing  his heart out. How the years fly.
Me encanta
I just gonna say THANK YOU BIG BROTHERS! 🙏🏻♥️🎶
God Bless You RCHP!
I love it , I love it, I love it. Thank you for your... everything.
RHCP and Arctic Monkeys new album this year. I'm ready for 2022.
Red Hot doing Red Hot ! Yeeeeeeah !
When i was in my 20‘s RHCP brought so many amazing memories for me❤️ My music taste literally grew up with them🎵 This song and good news from RHCP made my day ，i am sure millions of music lovers will listen this song for a very long time，thank you guys bringing what we and what music need 😊 I put this song in my heart just next to other RHCP songs 🥰
Wow, I can't wait for the album to drop.  Another instant classic by one of the best bands ever!
GENIUS OLDBOYS 🌶
Is Kiedis doing an Asian accent?
COME TO BRAZIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!
Johns back!
Johns talent has been carried this band for so long.
старички держат марку красаво
Антошка всё ещё дрыгается ♥️♥️♥️
eu nem sei quantas vezes já revi esse clipe
🔊🎶🎵🎶🤯💨🥇🏆🎸📀👑
Há tempos não arrepiava com uma música!
boooooooring. Why dont try to make new things
Meh. Frusciante is the only thing that keeps this song interesting. The song as a whole is very bland. Just my opinion as a huge chili pepper fan. Hopefully the album has some hidden gems though :)
Eu nem acredito nisso 🥰 the new sound to calm the soul that love.🥺🥰
A mesma pegada de sempre , nunca perde o ritmo e a essência . Show de bola
QUE LINDO QUE LINDOOOOOOOO🌶🖤
I’m so fucking happy I even cried a little bit. We missed you in this band, John.
Huh? Were they better with Josh?
Incredible jam!!! Long live the RHCP 🤘
Que música do Caralh○ !  🎶🤘🏻
🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Is there anything else I can ask for this year?   ¡DIOS Qué maravilla esto, gracias! Como suenan de bien, de auténticos, de RHCP!
PLEASE COME TO BRAZIL
RHCP being the real RHCP, the best lineup, that's the essence of the band.
MEU DEUS ASSISTI ARREPIADO A MÚSICA INTEIRA!!! EU TE AMO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And the shirt is OFF....
Anybody getting Californication + Otherside B-sides vibes from this?
😂
🌶🔥🤘
Producer: "It's an honor to have the Chili Peppers here in our studio." I see you fancy the green screen, what kind of direction were you thin-" Anthony: Yes John: Yes
Thank you Josh. Welcome back John.
2M V1EWS LET'S GO!
Can they even say "Black Summer?!"  This song probably get zero air time because of that. Sad days indeed. Pathetic even.
Long and awaited…. My soul got purified…
16 years waiting this...thanks rhcp <3
John is back!!!! 😃
Yeah!. Rhcp.
Metade das visualizações é do BR certeza ♥️
A tocarla =)
Seeing this, hearing this and knowing how many people have watched in such a short space of time. Honestly restores my faith in people. RHCP you absolute legends 🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥
Freaking legends ️

¡ESPECTACULAR LOS PEPPERS SIGUEN VIVOS CON TODO!!!!!
RHC forever
Rock n roll ain’t dead yet
This new album is going to rock!!!
Awesome to see the band with John again finally
Here we go this is what Red Hot chili peppers should be about. Like this band should have guitar solos and  other solos and crap. I thought there last album was just ok. But this song already for me is better than every song on there last album all together in my opinion.
This, this puts a smile on my face
Holy sheets drying in the wind! 1.4 million were first to see this amazing feat of creativity! 💚
PELO AMOR DE DEUS RHCP TENHA PIEDADE DE MIM!!!!!!!!!
How do i make this repeat endlessly?
Well....... Guess John's back.
Simplesmente foda para um senhor caralho.
Wtf is wrong with Kiedis’ accent?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i think they've lost it. good production but song is a bit of a miss for me.
Viva o Rock and roll, viva o Red hot Chilli Peppers!!!💥🤘🤘💥
Los extrañabamos! Welcome back Frusciante 💜
It feels so good to hear a new RHCP song with John in it. ❤️❤️❤️
I'm so glad Will Farrell rejoined the band again.
Thank you so much rhp

Je suis si heureux.
Bloody love it! Can hardly wait for the album to drop.  Unlimited Love to all of you. 🤟🏻xx🤟🏻
Anthony looks like the Tiger King now
Just an English comment to keep the fine balance here <3
People were complaining so much when this was posted in the Guitar world's page but I don't care about them man,I love this song,This song is bringing back memories,such a beautiful song...Go RHCP🤘
It's always the best day when the RHCP's have new music to share.
Diego Verdaguer está más vivo que nunca.
John ❤️👏💪
I love red hot chili peppers ❤️❤️❤️
This clip is worth watching at a speed of 1.25
Mega !!!
My boy looking like Fuse from Apex. Just need to give him an eyepatch now. Awesome song! ❤️🙌🏻
🥰🥰 hits you right in the feels
This song, this video!!!! Love it!!! Red hot rise!
Hell yes! The magic is still there!
.... Autotune killer......
Impressive. Anthony didn't miss a single lyric. LOL
I don't like it. Hope the rest of the album is better.
De vuelta!!!!👏no defrauda pero tampoco sorprende! Aguante rhcp!
Muito bom, aquela vibe "by the way" Que muito gosto. Mas como um fã, assim como todos, estou ansioso pra ouvir os Groovies do próximo álbum
Very good! Not sure about the moustache though. 🤨
Caramba que obra prima! Red hot vivíssimo, John de volta, só alegria! Vem álbum!!!!!  🇧🇷🌶️
Vamoss John !!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!
You just know when John's playing the guitar, it's that instant recognition from the first bar followed by alien warmth around one's soul that's been abscent for too long. You guys still got this and that makes me happy :)
I LOVE YOU! ❤ ALL HAIL FRUSCIANTE! 🙌
Im so massive glad to see y’all, especially Frusiante 💕
Es como si Under the Bridge y Californication tuvieran un hijo. Puro y hermoso fan service.
Listening to Frusciante is my way of knowing I was born in the right time. Thank you, sir.  Thank you, RHCP for sharing your art and joy of music.
ayñ
This is how to rock when you are getting close to 60. Reminds me the Californication-era RHCP, I dig it.
RHCP were my whole childhood and now it just keeps on going and on.. I fucking love this! <3
meh
Beautiful I’m so excited I seen them at the yum center in Louisville back in 2016 fucking love them
If only he had these stache shaved off. Finally.
Same old kind of melodie, same bass groove, same drum pattern, same kind of riff (love the chords changes), same feeling, same love going from ears to my heart ! Feel young forever with that band ! You know we were all waiting for John and he keeps on making a great art again !
See them playing together at the end gave me goosebumps. And I love that Anthony Kieds can’t wear a shirt for more than 1 minute and a half.
😱amazing!
Hoje eu fui promovido e me deparo com esse lançamento maravilhoso
La mejor banda del mundo, nunca me aburren sus canciones, saludos desde México 🇲🇽
Estoy llorando loco, que belleza
Fantastic song
John Frusciante saving RHCP on e again. First with Californication, then giving them Stadium Arcadium and bouncing. I'm a life long fan and its evident with this song they won a Grammy and just made KROQ relevant again.
Thanks goodness for the Red Hot Chili Peppers - This song felt like Rain in a scorching hot desert!
Уважаю Джону за характер даже бошку не помыл перед клипом. Слушаешь и понимаешь что ты ничего не знаешь об этом мире в отличие от этих ребят. Спасибо что вы есть в наших жизнях. Как жаль, что вы не приедете в Россию. I'll be waiting.
46 seconds to 55. Such a sweet spot.
Just Legends
He's nailing the virgin middle aged math teacher look
Excelente canción. Mi banda favorita.
Absolute perfection. Welcome back, John.
Good ole peppers.       Great song
Cara é muito bom você ver uma banda q vc escuta desde criança continuar tocando músicas novas, obrigado RHCP 🌶️❤️
Muito bom 😍😍
Let's fucking gooo. 2006 is back.
this song sounds just like something out of stadium arcadium and i can't describe how unbelievably happy that makes me. welcome back John, we missed you! ❤
So similar to what I felt in 99 after listening to Scar Tissue for the first time. The sound of that guitar moved me so much because it meant that John was back... Now he's back again, and with him evertyhing the Peppers have meant to me since '91.
Uhuuuuuuu i’m cry rigth now! The rockin roll its live because of the red hot chilli peppers! Jhon! Don’t out please!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Мы дождались этого)
NICE SONG
Eita música boa! 🙌🏻😍🌶
They're incredible!
Fodástico 🤩
Бомба!!!
Will Ferrell is my favorite Drummer
The Frusciante era is back boys and girls. Love this sound!
Aw, Thank Goodness.  Its been far too long!   Thanks guys.  Cant wait to hear the rest.
Listen as John Frusciante completely screws up the solo at 2:21 with one sharp note.  🤦‍♂️… come on guys.
Boring af
it’s awesome seeing john back with the guys
I’m crying 😍😍  Amazing !! ❤️❤️❤️
Another awesome song, they just keep on smashing it outta the park!!  👏👏👏
OMGGGG😍😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍
Que lindo levantarte escuchando esto, un mimo al alma <3
🤩🥰🥲
Ellos no lo saben, pero su música siempre logra darme tranquilidad en mis peores momentos💞 Me siento muy feliz de saber que Jonh volvió :) Ya se extrañaban sus solos y coros 🙂🎧
Love that John is Back! Really Looking forward to the evolution of their sound!
CARALHO olha o solo do Keanu Reeves
Esto es como un sueño
China is on the darkside of the moon... What the flattearthers say?
I stopped listening to RHCP when i found out Kiedes limed dating 14 year olds, but my nephew who is young and didnt know anyof that came running up to me saying igotta hear this so i did. Very much sounds like old school CP. Good for Jon to come back
I've been waiting too long for this moment, and finally it come, wonderful song, it was worth it!
Quero morar nesse clipe na moral 🇧🇷❤😎
J FROOSHHHH - LET'S GOOOO
Escuchar a estos manes  de dioses han dado y que sigan dando un espíritu tan único musical. Magníficos 💖💖💖
Nao sei direito o q achar
I'm in a lucid dream? 🤯 The RHCPs are back! 🌶️ It was worth every damn second of waiting. Greetings from Lima, Perú 🇵🇪🤟🏻
The mic stand is popping in & out of existence arriving in different places lol
The return of the king !!! So good to see John back with the RHCP. Can't wait for the album !!
Respect to the band for continuing to release original music, but this is just yet another toothless song from a bunch of guys who've long since lost their edge. It happens, I guess. I'm quite sure they're all MUCH better people now than they were 25 years ago, but all the mindfulness, meditation and "finding themselves" has fueled two decades' worth of tunes for 55-year-old, bored housewives.
Right there in the minute 2:51 , all reunite together in the video makes this video epic and one of the best things they have done since 2011.
Frusciante... Just Frusciante...
Great Great great….. please moooooore!!! Waiting too Long!
They’ve been making the same song for 40 years
2022 saved
Fire 🔥
Too see the boys back together my heart is melting 😭😭
Не очень
Love forever 💕
I havent been this happy in so long omfggggggg why does Anthony sing in an Irish accent tho?
JOHN FRUSCIANTEEEEE!!
John is an artist, pure and simple
Wow wow #rhcpforever
Que temazo!! Hermoso!!  ❤
aguante el rock loco despiertenme cuando pase el reggaeton
The fucking goat is back
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I missed those John harmonies 🥰🥰  This is classic RHCP fuckin love it
This world needs the RHCPs!!!!!!!! 🦑
🎸🛐
❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I like the music, I'm not liking the weird singing accent in the verses though
Frusciante was the soul sound of the band for years.  When he left, that vibe left with him.  Now that he's back, you can instantly just feel the energy return and the feeling of them being in their natural groove coming back with them.  He's just that good.  He's one of those rare guitarists that you could pick out of a lineup of 100 other popular guitarists with your eyes closed off the sound alone.
I've been waiting for John :')
As a fellow Southern Californian, I can assure you nows not the time to take the shirt off Anthony.  It’s freezing outside, lol.
The drums Sounds like if they sampled an older red Hot Chili Peppers Song for example californication
NEW RHCP IN 2022...IS SOOO 🅿️
después de tanto tiempo 🥲
Sounds like RHCP doing a song in the style of the RHCP. Maybe it's a grower, Stadium Arcadium was and it's one of my favourites, lots of memories associated with it. Let's see, I hope this is the weakest track off the album.
FunnyMike Diss Part 2😈😈😈😈😈 https://youtu.be/a_8jE4NTo_4 ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
спасибо, что вы есть! хуёвый день стал сразу лучше.
EEEEEEEEE! Great
Hell yeah now that's what I'm talking about!, The comeback single from them that I'm excited to have now listened to, From the epic guitars to the flawless vocals from Anthony. Wow this is quintessential Red Hot Chili Peppers. Also the production in this was through the roof. And I also likewise enjoyed this Music Video for it's breathtaking atmosphere and it's great visuals that complemented everything else!
🤓
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
que saudades que eu estava!!!!!!!
Yes 😌
Typical RHCP Sound.. I love this Sound.. Since 30Years ♥♥♥
What’s with the accent Keidis?
Já estávamos sedentos 😍🇧🇷
Que lindo que es volver a verlos juntos de nuevo !!!!
John's back babyyy
Como toda banda mítica los Red Hot son lo que son por sus integrantes si falta uno o se cambia alguno o si se agregara a otro dejaría de ser, perdería su escencia, como quitarle una extremidad al cuerpo humano, larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶️
Es como la primera vez que los escuché 😪
QUE CHIMBAAAAAAAA TAN HPTAA ESE SONIDO!!!
Guys you’re awesome!!! Stay’s always young in yours hearts!!!! We love you!!!
Finally! a new song to add to my playlist 🔥🔥🔥
Esta generación no los merece 😔♥️
i love you
Eles voltaram!!! Que foda!!!
I forgot John came back ahaha
Jhon es brutal 🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love it but what the hell is Anthony doing with these weird annunciation’s that’s fairly annoying I don’t know what he’s trying to create there but it sounds kind of stupid
Tão feliz presenciar isso <3
Excelente!!!
AAAA
Great song, dudes. Hope you guys were wearing sunscreen.
you are regent man!
YES YES SO MUCH YES. THIS IS ALL I WANTED AND JOHN IS BACK. Fucking great song!
😍😍😍
Pra quem achava que não veríamos os 4 juntos  novamente … recebemos essa obra de arte 🙌
Que hermosa sensación tuve al volver a verlos juntos! Larga vida Red Hot!
How good it is to see these 4 together again! Happy to see RHCP come back in full force.
Redhotchilipeppers neverdie.
Loving the sea shanty vibes.

What's this song really about? I thought it was a song about the Netflix series BLACK SUMMER,😂.

#BlackSummer
We've been waitin'... for John to come back. I finally can cry. RHCP and John are a crucial part of the soundtrack of my life. I know this is only the beginning of more great songs and memoirs. I feel they are only introducing themselves again, telling the story of that long black summer without him. I know there is more joy, magic and fun to come shortly.

ok, só só achei o instrumental perfeito mas não gostei da melodia???
Gostei, parece com Red Hot que eu ouvia em 2003.
This is the best song from the new album? Worse than the left overs from Stadium Arcadium!
MEU DEUS DO CÉU ELES NÃO LANÇAM UMA MÚSICA RUIM CARALHO!!!!! É A MELHOR BANDA DA HISTÓRIA NÃO TEM JEITO!!!!!!!!
заебато!
Ещё не сдохли,молодцы! Feminism is a cancer
Big like from RUSSIA👍
RHCP recovered their soul with John Frusciante.
Респект старым пердунам)))
EPIC COMEBACK. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Today the world is a better place
No me lo puedo creer nueva cancion!!!!
chingones como siempre
MY BABIES ARE BACK WITH A BANGER😍😍😍
Киану Ривз круто лабает на гитаре
Flea and Frusciante are the reason I picked up a guitar. So glad to see them back together again. Hopefully we get to hear some classic John Frusciante harmonies on the album.
FuckedYahhhhhhhhhh!
😍
Just heard they'd released this, put in headphones, turned it up, and wow.. surreal to hear them together again, bit emotional. Love the song, sounds like them. Johns presence on it is phenomenal, as always. Same for everyone.
Caraca 🇧🇷 Olha os cara, dichavando na guitarra tiu
:20 Tears For Fears  Roland dance lol
Can't believe Anthonys almost 60 and that ripped
Q lindo, cara
So Beautiful, How do they all look exactly the same, especially John🥰🔥🖤
Black summer in winter yeah!
90's style🤩 great job💪
At least Will Ferrell's still looking good!
I LOVE the new song (:
RHCP is my favorite band but this single is a little disappointing, hopefully the album is better. Just feels over produced (pitch correction on vocals, sterile instrumental) nothing really too memorable.
Great band I don’t get the porn moustache element though. Who told him it looks good? Gerbal dusters have been out of fashion since the 70’s gurl frens
Nice!
Multiple Suns!
I can't wait for the new tour and the return to Mexico 💜
Love you RHCP ❤️
Still on point!!!
Joder, Kiedis sigue mamado viejo sabroso
Frusciante sigue siendo el maldito dios 🤯🥴❤️
❤️
Will Ferell still looking good on the drums.
Legend!
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK LET'S GOOOOOOOO
te amoooo
He has like a Irish or Scottish accent lol, I can’t unhear it lol
Esta gente es genial. El diálogo entre los instrumentos no tiene desperdicio. Frusciante es un genio indiscutible... Definitivamente, es lo esperado...algo bien hecho y con profundidad. Todo revoluciona y no son los mismos de hace 20 años...No se puede pretender que hagan algo como lo hecho antes, es ilógico por naturaleza de la vida. Sino, que alguien intente usar de nuevo su ropa de cuando tenía 6 años...A ver si le queda o le sirve para algo...🇻🇪 Saludos desde Caracas Venezuela 👏🇻🇪
I'm in tears... never thought that would be so emotional to see frusciante playing in rhcp again
Me encantaaaa
Not as good as Dark Necessities but pretty good
It's perfect !! 🇧🇷
un buen momento para seguir con vida  Red Hot 🌶 Peppers ""!!!!
é tão bom escutar uma música nova dessa banda, principalmente agora com a volta do Frusciante
Absolute dog sh*tt, Anthony Kiedis couldnt sing for his supper. And what’s with his accent in this too I feel as this is a parody of a chilis song
Great song!
Anthony: Still looks fit Flea:Still looks like he's on drugs Chad:Awsome drumming as always John:hits us once again with that smooth tone  This is a certified RHCP song
flea parece estudiante de facultad de filosofía
Amazing !!! Legends are back!
Freaking legends ❤️
So beautiful! I love this song ♥️
Vi amo. Nessuno è comparabile a voi. Grazie Anthony, Chad, John, Flea.
It's funny and sad how this video shows "12 hours ago" and rest of them on the channel show "12 years ago"
Ahora sí regreso el verdadero RHCP! Con el genial John frusciante! Grandes!!
Whats with these comments! i cannot understand them
Welcome back John 💜
Amazing, y'all are the ones that makes all of us feel better ❤️
I feel like 1999 again. I need this right now. 🙌
Seeing them play together feels like a dream! :)
The solo was dope!
This is what I needed. Thank you RHCP 🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
VUMBORAA CARAAAII
I love you with all my soul
Already catched me man i love these guys
Ahhh, yes.  You guys still got it!!  🔥🔥🔥
Frusciante is aging finely 😂
Han vuelto!!
Amazing from start to finish
Essência que permanece, talentos que não se perdem. Não é atoa que é minha banda favorita! Linda música, surpresa muito boa. Apaixonada
Finally, they're comeback 🤘
It is inconceivable to me, How anyone could say anything negative about this inspiring and beautiful piece of music!  It's almost like they just keep getting better with age!  This is the type of thing that the US in the whole world need right now! RHCP 4 LIFE!!!! 🎸 🎸 🎸 🎤 🎤 🎤
Will Ferrel on the drums absolute LEGEND
They still got it!
It's amazing seeing them here, then going back to Under the Bridge music video, then jumping to Can't Stop and seeing the difference in their age, super time warp and a real journey we've all been on together.
They still got their essence and it's amazing. The guitar sounds so much frusciante, the bass is perfect, the nonsense lyrics, the chorus, the classic drum beat, anthony shirtless, the crazy psychdelic video. Ah, perfect. This is what I was expecting when they released a new song, perfection.
I just listened to this on pandora. I immediately heard John's influence. I yelled in celebration and almost teared up when the guitar solo hit.
Will Ferrel rocking on the drums!
🤣🤣🤣 Anthony looks like a porn star reject
This came out of nowhere for me and I'm all in. Good to see ❤
The king is back
Belleza 🔥🔥🤟...🌶🌶
We've come a long way from Fight like a Brave. Thanks for repeatedly contributing to the soundtrack of my life, guys.
FLAT EARTH!!
very RHCP :)
John ❤
Incredible, beautiful!! 🎶i've been waiting, i've been waiting FOR THIS 🎶 ❤
de corazon largavida  a los red hot chili peppers los quiero!!!
I didn't realise how much i missed this baseline🔥
ja sorry, aber nach by the way hat mich eigentlich nix mehr so stark berührt von rhcp. stadium arcadium auch nur 1,2 songs...
Meh
After years without solo guitar in rhcp ^^
Когда барабанщик заиграл, у меня по всему телу побежали мурашки,каейффф перцы как всегда🔥
No saben lo feliz que me hicieron en allá...algún momento de mi vida. Agradecida infinitamente por sus canciones. Y  para anthony  kiedis my crushhhhhh estas guapisimo siempre lo has sido y lo seras, querido mio.
é um sonho sendo realizado na minha vida. eu te amo, Red Hot 🔥🌶️♥️
So proud of Will Ferrell and his choice to return to his musical roots.
From the 80s to the 20s the chili's will always be jamming out to their own signature grooves. So hyped for Unlimited Love! 🌶🤘
So glad to see John back!!! The verse has a Gordon Lightfoot vibe to it, does anyone else hear it?!
))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
bañate john!
This is so deep and so emotional for me. This song makes me "That's it! That's the spirit!". The last two of RHCP albums are good but it made me feel like something was missing. Finally everything is complete now, of course with Frusciante. Thank you for all of you because you give hope to old school heads like me 🖤
Love this band...just can’t get use to the mustache. It’s been like 10’years now.
back again!
Tremendoo, es Increíble el sentimiento y la pasión  que tienen  ahora los RHCP . Esta presente la nostalgia de discos anteriores y lo nuevo, Como se nota la magia intocables  de John frusciante es inigualable su toque.  Volvió la felicidade. Gracias gracias gracias. Por tener vivo el fuego guys...
Amazing!!
volvió God Frusciante!
Tune
sem palavras.....
RHCP with Frusciante... legend!!
Me creerían si les digo que me saco una lágrima de felicidad? Es como volver a escucharlos en esa época de secundaria, y revivir tus vivencias con musica, a pesar del tiempo esto suena demoledor, no hay duda de que Frusciante hace una enorme diferencia, son demeritar a Josh. Podemos  decir que los Red Hot regresaron.16 largos años y valieron la pena
That Iggy pops brother.
Anthony's vocals seem to have a Scottish accent. Sounds pretty cool.  Different but cool. Great song.
Hemos recuperado la fe en la humanidad, Frusciante a vuelto y esto suena increíble. Gracias maestros por seguir inspirándonos como banda de Shimdra con respeto y admiración eterna.
chorei tanto
Damn
Revivio la guitarra, renacio el rock
John is back.
I’m dying at Anthony’s weird Norse Yiddish whatever funky accent at the beginning
Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers... Sus canciones son fragmentos de mis recuerdos... De lo mejor <3.
FANTÁSTIC VERY GOOD EXCELLENT.
Those rifs, that base, those drums, that singer. Something good for your soul 💫❤️💫❤️
me gustaba sinceramente el snterior guitarrista, igual fruciante es buenisimo
John is back ❤🙌
もう最高にカッコイイよ！
7 years ago I saw the chilis live, while they were great, I couldn’t help but feel sad that I would never see the band perform with John…I never in a million years imagined they would get back together and make great music again. Yet here we are 🥲
Anthony looks like Tiger King
Al fin volvió John! Hace 12 años esperaba esto. Gracias RHCP!
Oh wow!
He is still following me! https://youtube.com/shorts/NClZFdy0V38?feature=share
MILF Man I Love Frusciante 🌶️❤️🔥
Cant wait for Unlimited Love in April!! Rock on y’all🤘🤟
Algum brasileiro curtindo esse som? 🇧🇷
Love from serbia ❤️🇷🇸❤️
A banda da minha vida! ❤🇧🇷
Luke 24:49 (JFA) And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
Flanger just like wet sand ❤️
despues de tanto tiempo john  vuelve  csmr  hermosa  cancion!!
Мы любим Ред Хот Чили Пепперс, мамою клянёмся Любим Ред Хот Чили Пепперс, зуб тебе даём.. Good sound, you are the best.
Can we start a public petition to ban Anthony Keidis's barber from ever doing that to anyone ever again?
THEY'RE BACK !!!! Been waiting a years finally hearing and watching them just thankfully wonderful🤍🤍
Anyone else notice Anthony's strange inflections? Don't get me wrong, I'm buying this album, and I will see 'em at Fenway Park in September, I'm just saying, Ant be using funky inflections. I love you all. ❤️💛💚✊🏾✊✊🏽✊🏿✊🏻✊🏼
🤙🏻
First notes at likes so tasty🤯😋
Anyone else in 2022?    Kappa
🤘🏽❤️
Que FELICIDADE!! Essa banda, marcou minha vida.. ali no começo dos anos 2000!! Me lembro, indo pra escola, ouvindo o álbum do Californication e By The Way.. Meu avô faleceu em 2003 e a música Can't Stop tocou bem na hora que soube da notícia, ela estava passando na MTV.. era criança, mais isso me MARCOU de uma forma inexplicável!! Obrigado mesmo por existir e que venha anos e anos de banda, te amo Red Hot Chili Peppers!! 😍🇧🇷
;-;
si fuera laport diria "NECESITO QUE SAQUEN UN DISCO"
new rolling stones ?
Damn legends. I miss them so much!!!
ESCUCHAR Y VERLOS JUNTOS DE NUEVO....ME REMONTA A LAS MILANESAS DE MI MADRE!...ESS SENSACIÓN QUE HACE AÑOS NO EXPERIMENTABA... GRACIAS RHCHP!!!
С возвращением, Джон!
Anthony, Flea, John and Chad!!!! thats the comment
Impeccable!
New song, sheesh
это. просто. охуенно!
Sound stock like everything else. One hot minute they actually sounded different for the better
❤
Finally. Heroin
Great Song! I feel the essence of the Californication era is back and maybe even a little better. These four are the definitive Chili Peppers lineup and it's refreshing to see them together again. I think great things are on the horizon for RHCP!
John's guitar sounds better than ever! Long live RHCP!
Yes
culiame flea
Nothing change❤️
Piece of art.
드디어..!!
Gracias eternas y gracias Frusciante.
Will Ferrell is killing it on drums
Love this! Kinda gives me western vibes in the beginning 😍
Shit song.
It's so great to have you back John.
Com todo respeito!! Eles estão de volta porraaa!
Amazing 😍
yesssss <3 <3 <3 <3
Pinche rolota me despeina los pelos de los webos de lo poderosa que esta
Una nueva canción de los red hot. El universo se equilibra. Es como estar en casa.
i have to write something under this masterpiece 🔥
the world woke up making more sense today. legends!
lleva solo 5 segundos de Frusciante , para ya saber que es un nuevo clasico ,  increible !!
ICONOS  salvan a nuestros oídos y sentimientos entre tanta basura musical actual  LOVE RHCP
Certified classic
me corrí
Gần giống Slow Cheetah
This made my day at work easier
❤️❤️
Jon is the soul of this band, so excited they’re here able to recapture the magic again…can’t wait for the new album
tra la la
Oh my man
AMAZING! well that's a good start to the weekend ^^
More of the same.
EU AMEI, FICOU PERFEITA, ESTOU ARREPIADA. RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS IS ALIVE ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sonho: rhcp tocando no Castelão, aqui em Fortaleza :(
Pretty good
Vuelven a sonar como los Chili Peppers con Frusciante
Engraçado a vibe que as músicas do RHCP passa. Parece que eu já conheço a música há muito tempo.
JOOOOOOHN
nasci em 2005, ouvi os caras minha infância inteira, e poder acompanhar eles lançando coisa nova agora é foda. é muito talento pra uma banda só!
groso Iggy pop
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq
nem acredito que estou vendo isso  aaaaaaa. uma obra prima pro ouvido vocês juntos novamente 😪❤️ 🌶
Ver os 4 juntos de novo é a mesma sensação de ver os 3 Homem-Aranha lado a lado. Que venha o novo disco ❤️
Looks like Anthony is going for the frank zappa look. 😏👍
por fin están de vueltaa los pepperssssssssss
0:43 - 0:56 soooooooo Frusciante!!!! Sooooooo Peppers!!!! Makes me sooooooo HAPPY!!!!!
Great to hear from you guys! Glad to hear your sound again John!
John’s solo is as better as it used to be , we missed that  Thank you chili peppers ❤️
Cant wait for the album!! Loving this!! Oh and welcome back John!!
These guys are exactly what I think of when I think about the culture of America. If there is 1 band everyone needs to hear it is the Red Hot Chili Peppers 🤘
THEY’RE BACK🙌😭
Os meninos estão de volta ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is just another same ole same ole from a once innovative band.
Bad Song
やべーーーー ついに来た！
Still the same awesome, swag vibing Red Hot Chili Peppers. Very cool to see them still over here :)
Fucking YES  YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
GRANDES, REYES!
freaking awesome . first day comments , but im sure im gonna be listenig to this for years to come
Desde las 00hs dándole  en bucle a este video. Los amo tanto Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤ feliz 4 de febrero por este temazo❤🌶🎶
Te amo Fru 🥺🤍 I’m crying!!!
the way he was holding the mic - i was waiting for him to scream or growl
They just keep making beautiful music. John and Flea have a sound that can not be duplicated
Muito top demais 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Как долго мы этого ждали! 🌶
Fucking awesome song
Sensacional, sou muito fã
Does Kiedis age ?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
john ! gracias por volver
Wow didn't even realize these guys were still making music 🎶 I enjoyed this song this morning 🙂
This will be an awesome song when it’s played a million times a for the next 10 years
It just feels right seeing Frusciante back in the band
Sounds like a reject from BTW b-side... kinda dissapointing. Still good tune though
Me da algo de tristeza por Josh, porque duró 10 años en el grupo y solo regresó Frusciante y lo sacaron pobechito
California, 2022…I 4 sciamani si sono ritrovati… e sono nuovamente guidati da un’inconfondibile melodia psichedelica…John is back baby…John is back home 🙏🏻🔥🎸
It's just great to see john back
You only like Under the Bridge. You think you like their other songs, but you don't.
Yes.  Fucking Yes
No soy el mas fan de RHCP, pero si soy rockerazo desde el clásico hasta el metal (obviamente he escuchado RHCP y los conozco bien), y lo que me gusta de ésta canción es que tiene la escencia de RHCP, tiene buena melodia que nos recuerda por partes a sus emblemáticas canciones, tiene buen ritmo, está jodidamente bien hecha. Aplausos.
Bem-vindo de volta, John Frusciante! Sentimos sua falta.. .Agora sim o time está completo ❤️
Canção fantástica! Frusciante, linda voz!
Incredible!!! <3
Riffs voltando a existir no RHCP Além do peso que estava faltando
Increíble
Jesus Frusciante is back !
Will Ferrell !!!!!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
O tempo passa e nada muda, bom demaissss ❤️❤️🔥
I am not a fan of tuning his vocals. His character comes from his imperfections.
Esos solos de John Frusciante ya se extrañaban
And just like that..... the magic's back ❤️❤️
Никогда никого не слушайте. Имейте своё мнение, свою голову, свои мысли и идеи, планы на жизнь. Не гонитесь ни за кем — только шаг на встречу, но не вдогонку. Вы никому не нужны. Это – жизнь
Que bueno que vengan de vuelta, pero es como escuchar el by the way... seria interesante hacer cosas inovadoras como siempre
Ya con esto hicieron la mejor cancion de todo el mes. Hermosa cancion. RHCP forever !!🤘❤🤘
アンソニーがやっぱり上裸で安心しました。
Melhor banda 🤘🏽
John ♥
I love you rhcp !
I'm a huge fan of the RHCP music , having said that I think they missed the mark on this one. I enjoyed Frusciantes guitar sound. PEPPER FOR LIFE🤘
I absolutely love it you have another brilliant song to the collection.
Thank You!
Increíble volver a verlos juntos haciendo cosas nuevas. Somos unos afortunados de ser contemporáneos a ustedes. Larga vida RHCP
🇲🇽🇲🇽🔥🔥🔥🔥
muy buena pero Fruciante no merece estar ahí a cada rato les da la espalda  y han hecho música genial sin el todas las veces esta pieza esta super cool

The sound pattern of Frusciante's guitar is very rich and beautiful
Que saudade de ver esses caras reunidos de novo bixo ❤️
Estupendo 🚀🌌
Nooo wreszcie ! Nie mogę się doczekać 1 kwietnia i następnej płyty do kolekcji 💪
On this time when we have "music" like bad bunny an those sh*ts, we really apreciate that this real music exists and they are creating it. Thanks RHCP
Now, Legend! 🔥
Frusciante is a god….
THIS is exactly what the world needs right now! Thank you 🙏
~*~
Ily all so much; it's such a great song😍
"It's ZORRO!"
They continue to keep our flames burning bright. Keep shining your light on the world RHCP! 🔥🖤
Sí es Frusciante ❤🥺😭❤❤❤
edannn!
Dope kinda.   But kinda a miss in my opinion
As talented as ever but now I see the four of them since a quite long time makes me find them really old jajajajaja
Really nice to see John back
Tears of joy🥲😍
Finalmente non vedo l'ora
Sounds good, might grow on me. . Not as good as Dani Calfornia, or By the way. More of a album track I think
Alegrou minha sexta-feira
Los amo bo
What guitar effects does John use?
Vi amo🔥❤️
все такие же перцы и все такая же классная музыка!
I love You! It's because of you that my biggest fun in life is music. You inspired me to do this, especially Frusciante's soul <3
Great stuff - smile grew bigger and bigger throughout peaking when the band finally came into the same shot together. Can't wait for the album.
wow will farell was featured!
I was ready to say it sucked until the solo came in.
valio la pena la espera...arte
🤟
Frusciante ha vuelto!!!!!
Mis red hot abuelitos motherfucker chili peppers <3
so pretty sure the past like 5-7 singles have all had the same chord progression for the chorus
Кайф!
WWWWWWWWRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH                         IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!
TOP TOP TOP, bem no estilo de antigamente, parabéns.
Hmm weak for a new single 🤔

0:44 La guitarra en esa parte es oro puro!
John frusciante forever
It"s perfect song! Amazing perfomance for nowadays!
Glad to see yall still doing #music
Volvio John papaaa
QUEEEEEEEEE maravilla
Remember in the 70s bands released multiple albums a year....those were the days.
I’m not a huge RHCP fan and most old bands seem to have a hard time putting out solid material but dang this is really good. I mean REALLY REALLY good!
Amazing song. One of the best in years
El primer riff es magia, que hermoso frusciante
Mi banda favorita <3 Esa escencia de sus sonidos no se pierden en lo mas mínimo!
AWESOME LEGENDS :)
These dudes have lost the damn plot.
top
Los amo con toda mi vida <3
Meh.

Somos almas que han crecido con la leyenda de RHCP*, somos energía para ellos y ellos para nosotros. Somos una leyenda que se escribe con el tiempo. Nos reponemos a pandemias, adicciones y tiempos oscuros, florecemos con RHCP* y la banda con nosotros. Somos leyenda que se escucha y se vive. Somos un estilo de vida.

Frusciante brilliant
I don't know how many wrestling fans we have in here but, doesn't Anthony look a lot like Eddie Guerrero from back in early 2000s?! Awesome song!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to endFONTE VAGALUME BRASIL
Damn i got goosebumps when i saw that John brought his legendary guitar from back in the days
Jesus Christ that is bollox
Thanks fellas. Always amazing to hear more of your music.
This guitar solo is best in 2022
Verlo de vuelta a John es ver una obra de arte. Se te extrañaba feliz 😊 me encanto la canción 🎶
Nice
Frusciante regreso con su guitarra de siempre que bueno estar vivo
this song is amazing
Legal demais, o som bem cru e tal… porém eu não curti o arranjo de batera.
I'm not sure how to feel about the modern mullet. But John Frusciante in RHCP? Yes please. Big time Californication and By the Way vibes here.
Alah siah Meuni raoseun kang 🤘
This song makes me think that every thing is gonna be ok
bora JÃO!
I am an Indonesian who has admired this band since I was 7 years old, and I am now 26 years old. and now this song makes me so happy
I’ve been emotional and overwhelmed all day listening to this. POETIC GENIUSES.
😭😭😭😭
auto tuned rhcp?
RHMFCP! So glad JOHN IS BACK. All is right with the world again!
¡¡¡ES BELLÍSIMO!!!  Gracias por esta vuelta Peppers, tan necesaria y fresca; este sencillo me parece bellísimo y perfecto, incluyendo su video súper noventero, no le falta nada. Volvieron a sus épocas súper californianas con un sonido potente e impecable. No saben cuanto extrañaba la guitarra y los coros de John acompañando el bajeo de Flea, el ritmo de Chad y la voz de Anthony. Definitivamente será un discazo, gracias por refrescarnos con su esencia y su energía Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!  P.d. ¡Uno siempre vuelve a donde fue feliz!
Classic RHCP look & sound. JF & his Strat are in their usual fine form.
I wanna hear this without all the edits. It feels like they dumbed down a lot of things about raw this could be in the studio.
BRAZIL LOVES YOU FRUSCIANTE, YOU BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF HUMAN BEING. LOVE IT, LEGENDS, CHILLI PEPPERS FOR LIFE!
BORING, FORCED AND A LITTLE BIT SILLY. SICK BASE LINES AND GOOD VIBES AT THE END. THE REST IS GARBAGE. SRY CAPS. DISAPOINTED. FRU FRU IS BACK. NIC AT LEAST THEYRE ALL TOGETHER. PEACE
The king is back!🎸
🔥🔥🔥
Tks Frusciante, tks RHCP 💙
There's no way rn
"ive been waiting for another black summer " RHCP I LOVE YOU!!!!! FUCKi wanna cry with joy
Na to czekaliśmy !  Jest forma Panowie 😊
Blackie Dammit RIP 05-12-21, In Respect “Black Summer” Good Sir, Fan dedicate to you LA Summers for Flea + Anthony because of you The King of Sunset Strip, Legends made of this  No doubt mistakes made not to downsize details Point being, you witnessed these young men form & countless reformations through boys 2 adults RHCP truly Re-Form-Ed 2022, core heart remains  This first Single off new album, Masterfully Done!

Estos grandes sí que merece millones de visitas y no ciertos vídeoclips de esa pseudomúsica que todos saben a qué me refiero 😌
Неперевершено! Як завжди. Respect from Ukraine!
perfeitos
Que buen tema lpm🥰😍
I'm excited to hear the RedHotChiliPeppers are getting back to something more pure, more Red Hot. Post Stadium Arcadium they dabbled in alternative styles, it wasn't bad, but I think this is the style that better represents their DNA, which is after all, ours too😉
Que frescos regresaron, uno pensaba que ya no seria como antes pero la verdad esta canción toca el alma😭❤️
Jonh i love you 😍
Good job guys!! 👌
I an RHCP fan always good music 🎶
My reactions listening to this song:  Play 1: 😒 Really? 16 years Waiting and that's the best they can do?  Play 2: 🤔 Wait, there's something here...  Play 3: 🧐 the solo isn't bad, the vocals are ok, flea and chad are doing their job  Play 4: 😍 this song is amazing. I can't stop listening  ...  Play 57382848: 🥰🎙️ Waiting on another Black Summer to eeeeend
สุดยอดครับลูกพี่
Simplesmente FANTÁSTICO
🤟🤘🤟🤘🤙🤟🤘🤟
the world might go to shit, but at least we have rhcp back
Te amo John
This song musically is quite nice... but is pretty weak other than John's solo, and these goddamn nonsense lyrics hahaha but of course.
Nooo lo puedo creer! AHORA sí suenan como los RHCP! Que feliz me siento ahora. Hemos tenido que esperar mas de 10 años para verlos de nuevo juntos! Legendarios.
Don‘t know what to think about this but im glad they are Back 🌶. Let’s see what the rest of the album will sound like.
Check an acoustic version https://youtu.be/BthzZwmw_Wc
I love the Woody Harrelson bass tone 🎸🎛️
So good to see john back 😍
Amazing, I loved song!!! My eternal Idol!!
❤
Музыка в стиле RHCP)))
como te extrañé  Frusciante 💜
Hell, u guys still killing it
I love your <3
¡Legends never die! 🌶🔥
Se loko, que vibe da preula, John é mestre demais.
We ❤️u
🌶️🌶️🌶️
Just what i needed 👐
Increíble, la Psicodelia Funk en todo su esplendor. 🌶Red Hot Chili Peppers; que grato volver a verlos juntos y cuanta nostalgia en este hermosa canción "Black Summer", Hermoso.
Missed the sound of Johns guitar 😩😂
Oooooh Me senti ouvindo uma música do Stadium arcadium.
No offense to Josh, he was amazing, but RHCP is back! There's a smoothness and feel that John just brings that makes it feel like home. The last records without him were mostly drum & bass driven and that sense of melody was missing in my opinion. Looking forward to the album!!
🤘🏼🇧🇷🖤
Sounds like it could be on Stadium Arcadium
The sun is only good when seen from this angle: https://youtu.be/4QsGsj74p8k
first drum beat reminded me of californication, maaaaan things are like they always supposed to be...
Okay all im saying is, Anthony would be a badass villain in a movie or a tv show, i could see it.
RHCP ❤️👍🏻🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
I've been waiting for this moment since John left the band.
HAHAHA Parece que voltamos 20 anos atrás e estamos ouvindo novamente, que nostalgia boa.. Esse baixo sempre me conquista, cada ano que passa Flea só melhora.
Essa música é um renascimento que o Rock estava precisando. É um suspiro de renascença, de recuperação. Quem sabe agora depois de uma música foda dessas o Rock volte a ficar em alta novamente. Parabéns ao Red hot por limparem nossos ouvidos com essa música maravilhosa. Viva as músicas boas, viva o Rock e viva o Red Hot Chili Peppers.. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Al finnn:)
Thank the Great Creator for the RHCP!  That's fucking good!
É fascinante a atualidade e a essência do RHCP presente nessa música. Que viagem no tempo ❤
Will Ferrell is actually a good drummer!
Kiedis is 59 y.o damn!!
Que música incrível!! Feliz demais pela volta do John a banda!!
Frusciante estás locooooo
🔥🔥🔥😎🎊🎉🤙🏻⚡🤜🏻🤛🏻💣
Salve RHCP!!😍✨🎶
AAAahhh con ese solo de Frusciante alcanza.. Salud!
GRACIAS RHCP. Las leyendas no mueren

Que emoción leer los comentarios
Que energia!🎸🔥
😭😭😭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 can't believe they're back together!
John Frusciante is one of those very few guitarists who would strum a chord and you instantly know that's him.   The tone brings joy and pleasant silent happiness! It's like massage for the soul. So pleased with RHCP's new old stuff if you get what I am talking about.
Fantástico volveros aver ha sido emocionante gracias R H C P  Eli
Is John a vampire, dude legit hasn’t aged a day

Gracias RHCP por este magistral regreso, los Amoooo ❤️🖤🤟🏼
Way better then what ever that last album was
Es una buena canción pero la verdad esperaba mucho más

la vrd mis ojos se embargan de emocion al escucharlos, yo creci con esta musica, y gracias a mi tio que en paz descanse el me hizo escuchar, larga vida a los RHCP Y A FRUSCIANTE !!!!!!!
You've done it again R.H.C.P!! 👏  SO glad frusciante is back where he belongs!!! Withought him it just doesn't feel complete. Also has that hendrix vibe mixed with his own flavor.. the 🌶 peppers are legends!! The band is ONE again!!! Much love!! Great song cool video!!!
I am afraid I will wear this song out ahead of the new album. I need to stop pressing play!
Korn puts out a new album and the Chili Peppers put out a new song. It's like I'm 16 again
I have no words to describe how happy I am after I heard this song! ❤ Love RHCP forever! ❤❤❤
the vibes are immaculate
John wick on guitar, amazing
Que bueno ver tendencia musical en chile  , música verdadera !!!! Aguante los chili peppers 4ever csm !!!!!!!!!!!
Timeless Musicians ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Good job peppers😉👌
EU AMO ESSES FILHOS DA PUTA 🔥🔥🔥
Dios bendiga a Diego Verdaguer
Boring....
He dances like Mac
Red Hot Chili Peppers 2022
Frusciante sounding so right back on the strat, man. Love this so much. So mellow and groovy. Can't wait to see you guys at Globe Life in September!!
Este pequeño momento de mi vida se llama felicidad ❤😍
Já ouvi em looping
Старые-добрые перцы! Полуголый прокачанный торс, ниндзуцкие жестикуляции руками, шальной взгляд Фли, и актёр Уилл Фарелл на ударных :)))
Simplemente agradecido por poder estar vivo para verlos juntos una vez más, no puedo creer que esto esté pasando y hay que disfrutarlo al máximo cada segundo de sus canciones, cada parte de su letra y cada melodía de sus instrumentos. I love RHCP!
Como e incrível e o maluco voltar e o red hot acende de novo, muito foda.
John is back. They all look great together.
Vamos antonios!!! 🔆
So great to see this line-up back,  feels like 1999 again
Antarctica immortality vs cremation because it is cheaper (at 500) and obligated by lots of belief systems to use medicine to stay alive with (the digitization of consciousness mechanically using your brain while preserving it).  Digitization of consciousness is complementary when becoming a US Serviceman but there is little control for yourself if you earn that so you'll need to create stints to help that and most people aren't servicemen and will need our cell phone electrode's app processing your mind into a digitized consciousness stint aka infomorph so that when the light that is your consciousness temporarily is frozen when time comes which slows it's activity down it is amped back up to acceptable standards of operation with the digitized consciousness stints powered by the electrodes connected to your smartphone. 2000 a day can't afford cremation so this works because it is simply person with cellphone electrodes app thrown on a freezer boat then dropped off in Antarctica.
This is awesome! Good job, boys!
Omg i love it♡♡♡♡🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yuk.....
Ok, we love it. Greetings from Brazil, hope to see you guys some day.
He looks like Eddie Guerrero with a mustache
<3
эталлон крутизны, красавцы
Welcome home, John !!
Good to see Begby, out of trainspotting, more at peace.
i no doubt love seeing frusciante back, but i'm also sad to see josh gone. love them both.
Very red-hot-chili-peppery. ❤️❤️
A felicidade deles tá estampada!! ❤️🇧🇷 RHCP ❤️🎶
Yowie Wowie
Este video no tiene un súper aire a AROUND THE WORLD????
Amazing
Es increíble tenerlos nuevamente... lo mejor de los mejores!
Esto me lleva a mi niñez cuando tenía 9 años y los empecé a escuchar. Que placer da escucharlos tocar a todos juntos  🙌🏻✨
Me quedé sin palabras y con una sonrisa en la cara. He vuelto a tener 16 años.  Gracias por volver JOHN ANTHONY MOTHERFUCKER FRUSCIANTE!!!

I am very happy right now ಥ‿ಥ

Gracias peppers !! Saludos desde Argentina. Los quiero y por muchos mas ❤
There are more comments in Spanish and Portuguese than there are in English for this video.
Can't wait for the album!!!
„Black Summer” was actually a good show on Netflix. Waiting for the new season, kurwa
Didn't know Will Ferrell was on the drums.
Me encanta❤❤🔥🤘🏻🎊
Los quiero mucho chicos, sigan así 🤍
THE BOYS ARE BACK. Oh my god, this feels so good to see them together and that sound so unique. This album is going to be another great Frusciante creation, I CAN'T WAIT!!!
Best of The Best
it's just nice to see john with a guitar in his hand again
Seeing both Rubin and Frusciante back is like the coolest thing, I'm so excited for this album
Not disappointed. <3 <3 Anyone else pick up a little Irish Sea Shanty in Anthony's voice?
These guys are living legends. I've been a fan since way back 2003. Wow. Good to see they're still so active and well after so many years. The spirit of their music is still intact. ♥️
Это...апупенно...
Grande los red hot chili ya los extrañaba
I am forever grateful that Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrell learned to play the electric guitar and drums.
Menuda mierda...Está gente lleva sin hacer un disco bueno desde la época de Blood,sugar,sexo, Magic.. Arrastrandose x los escenarios desde hace ya casi 30 años, lamentables!!
Brutalisimo, los mejores, me devolvieron las ganas de vivir 🤘🏽🎧💯👌🏽
The fist positive thing in 2022!!!
Por um momento, a nostalgia tomou conta. Sensacional!
YESSSSSSS ROCK THAT MULLET ANTHONY 😤😤😤😍😍😍
Envejecí con ellos y ahora rejuvenezco con este tema ♥
Anthony is almost 60yrs old and his body still shredded
L'âme des red hot est de retour en la personne de John Frusciante🤘🤘🤘
Apparently the song's about the Black Summer fires of 2020 in Flea's native Australia
Sox on Cox 😎🤘🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
AMAZING ❤️🤘🤟🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Any English comments around here? 😀
Χημεια Ολα
Volvio la vieja escuela
❤️❤️❤️
Espero morir de viejo oyendo las canciones viejas y nuevas, esas que me han acompañado a lo largo de esta vida gracias RHCP for ever
Leyendas
This is just my own narrow and subjective opinion but I wish they take a new and surprising turn with the next few songs. I was hoping they would shift to the super funky rap like early Peppers for the new album with lesser lyrical references to sex, vaginas and California.
Jon Bernthal
What a solo !!!!
I really needed this today. ❤️❤️  Rhcp is so soul calming.....my soul needed their vibe. I love it.
THIS IS RED HOT CHIL PEPPERS!!! DREAMS COME TRUE!!! I WAS WAITING A LONG TIME AGO FOR THE JOHN AGAIN IN THIS BAND AND NOW HE IS!!! PLEASE COME TO BRAZIL!!!!!
When the band is good... Always find a way to to    do great musics!
I've been waiting .... This for so long !!! Well comeback guys with John 😍🤟 awesome

There baaaaaaackkkkk babyyyyyy! Chili Peppers on 🔥 🌶 John just sounds awesome! The rhythm section between the band is brilliant 👏 👌 🙌
❤️🇧🇷
Can’t wait to hear this live. I will be at the Seattle show 🌶
Exquisite. Gorgeous guitar tones.
Dudes really lookin like my strung out trailer neighbors
I wish Kiedis had this energy in the shows. Great song.
todos com 60, o frunciante com 51 parece ate novo
😭
😍
"Капец" как их давно не было  видно и слышно!!!😳 Я их работы помню так это где клип с таксистом "безбашенным" и про Калифорнию...
que alegria mano pqp
Wow!!!! Maravillosooooo
Very Stadium Arcadium sounding. They pretty much picked up where they left off. Looking forward to the album!
🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Back in the game. Frusciante Magic!
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
How many bands out there have done what the RHCP have done? From Freaky Styley in 1985 to Unlimited Love in 2022  - 37 years. I’m 47 & have been a a RHCP fan for longer than I’ve been married. Their music, their writing and their sheer God given talents just seem to give us something different each time and all the while they remain who they always set out to be - making music just for them; because they just love to jam.  What an awesome journey to be a part of ♥️🔥🥶🌶🤘🏻🤘🏻♥️♥️
Welcome back John Frusciante. Thanks for bringing the soul back into the band.
I had a ticket to see you in Athens in 2020 :( Sadly covid ruined our plans :(
Hey are you a good person? If you have ever lied,stolen,or taken God's name in vain or broken any of his commandments you are guilty you deserve punishment just like in a court of law if you commit a crime you get justice served to you. God is perfect judge and carries out perfect justice do you know what God did for guilty sinners he went to the cross paying their fine just before he died he said IT IS FINISHED. the debt of mankind has been paid for by his blood he suffered the death penalty on the cross to keep you out of hell. just like in a court of law you can pay someone's fine that's what Jesus did please repent and trust in the saviour today you will be saved this life is a mearly 80 to 90 years but eternity is forever please choose life today come to Jesus he's calling you by name
🔥🌶❤
Musica incrível parabéns Red Hot, nunca perderam a essência de anos atrás parabéns 🤘🏼❤
Here in Canada, et particulièrement au Québec...we are waiting for a very long black dark bitter and polar winter to end! -30 locked in my house unjabbed and unloved, soon wont even be able to go to hospital or grocery store.... i wish i could make music to let it all out!!
Its beautiful, I love you
Wow, more one incredible music
<3
RED HOT CHILI PEPPPERS RISES. ¡LARGA VIDA!
თქვენ რო როკავთ ეგრე არავინ 😋🌍🌎🌏✊
Thank you guys! Thank you! 🙏💙
Maybe I'll warm up to it but not at first listen.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
Clipe totalmente com a cara de Under The Bridge 😍😍😍
🇧🇷
Wow
Welcome back John
Pure ecstasy  nice to see them not selling out
muito bom
Multimillionaires in another cheap clip without any script Why why why why you cant film crazy super fun-to-watch clip???
❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are amazing! John Fusciante, again, welcome! 🎸
Music: 😍😍😍  John and Flea together again: 😂😂😂😂  Anthonys hair style: 😖 (in German we call something like that a Vokuhila Konfirmandenfrisur).
Not bad and nothing special, hopefully it's not the best song from the upcoming album.  Dark Necessities > Black Summer
John is back ! <3 It's 1999 again
Fantastic return to form! Very special this!
BOM PRA CARALHOOOOOOOO 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Good Vibes. Happy to see Frusciante come back!
Chills hearing Frusciante!!! Feels like home
Ahhh , i am crying ❤ Unfiltered real rhcp ❤
Sounds awesome. Am I the only one who wants to play Super Mario when I see Anthony's moustache 🤔
cada vez se pone más buena la canción
good job will ferrell on the drums
FRUSCIANTE‘s GUITAR CAN HEAL COVID💜 Welcome Home🤟🏻🙏🏻
John Frusciante on the guitar. Will Ferrell on the drums. Amazing.
China is on the far side of the moon. Since the moon does rotate once every 29.5 Earth days all sides eventually get sunlight.
I see more and more millennials and zoomers overlook and even shit on RHCP and that's just unacceptable. This song is proof of that. So great and special to hear that guitar and that bass playing, with Chad's drums and Anthony's vocals and lyrics tying it all together. Top 5 maybe even top 3 bands of the last 40 years, easily.
Tengo esto en bucle desde hace 3 horas
Thank you! True Lords of Los Angeles! Beautiful song!
FRUSCIANTE FOREVER!
Fuck yeah , come to México please , i wanna rock   Super song  And so exited for the black of frusciate
🎧😃
JOHN FRUSCIANTE
When the guitar made its intro, i know its John Frusciante... Welcome Back...
LOS AMOOOO DIOSSSSS🔥🔥🔥
I love the chemisyty john and flea hAve
Pure Granola
I am speechless. Goosebumps!! Classic RHCP with Frusciante’s guitar sound!
Oh my goshhhh it's amazing!!!
''Slow Cheetah'' feelings...
Боже,какие же они старые стали,но песня класс
Great, absolutely great. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎼🎵🎶❤
La primera vez que la escuchè la verdad no me atrapò mucho, me parecia una canciòn regularsilla como para ser un single, ya escuchandola varias veces mas me he dado cuenta de que tiene su sabor distintivo y la esencia de la banda està impregnada totalmente en ella. Grandes Chili Peppers!! Espero ansioso el disco que de seguro serà un total exito y disfrute para nuestros oidos.
Que buen momento para estar vivo 🤩
John Frusciante is single handedly keeping Jimi Hendrix alive. he adds his own taste but that style is instantly recognizable. thank you John
Muchas emociones encontradas que genial ver a toda la banda completa que buena producción 🌶️💥hay red hot chili peppers para rato, frusciante no te vayas nunca más haces la diferencia 💥💥🖤
Adding to the playlist
I like it! Gives me Scar Tissue vibes.
hit me nowww 🌶
Waiting for this
Me acaban de regresar a mis 15 años RHCP, los amo y siempre los amaré!
RHCP LOVE FOR EVER <2
😍😍😍😍😍
❤
Loved Josh, but it’s uncanny that Frusciante is the backbone of RHCP
RHCP ♥️♥️
Amazing, I didn't expect this to be that great. What a friggin' awesome tune! Can't wait to listen to the whole album soon.
最高！
Amazing 🔴🔥🌶peppers  🤩👏💥
Best ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
No que Diego Verdaguer ya estaba muerto ?
Reading all the LOVE for the Peppers just made my day ❤
Finally John is back <3 Please split up if he decides to leave the Band again. :D Can't wait for the new album. Much love
Não dá nem pra acreditar que voltaram, me sinto nos anos 2000
Piel de gallina mi amigo. Música mística, introspectiva. Me recuerda a Nirvana en algunas partes de su melodía
No me sorprende que esta canción sea un descarté de By The Way retrabajado, Y ya son 20 años de ese disco. Esperaba algo espectacular sinceramente y veo que muchos se emocionan solo porque esta Frusciante.
Fantastic!!!👏👏👏
please come to Honduras!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kinda' Stadium Arcadium... Love it :)
Ketika pertama kali mendengar lagu ini seketika langsung Inget lagu slow cheetah
Que saudade que eu tava 🤎
Has there ever been a more overrated band than RHCP? The 'teases' have been cringey and shit, the end result is somehow worse. Crap band.
I've listened to it yesterday. I've received on whatsApp from a friend. How did he get it i don't know
muy buena la cancion :D grande red hot chilli peppers :DDD
Welcome back John!!!
WOW! Love it! Once again outstanding. Nice jobs boyz!
ギターソロを聴いてニンマリしてしまった
It’s not a coincidence that this is there best song since 2006, it’s the magic of John and the chemistry he has with the other 3, no one can replicate that, he’s a special guitarist, no one matches his backing vocals, riffs and solos, welcome back king 👑
Freaking legends ❤️
Cara q musica boa na moral pqp e amo RHCP
My mum used to sell them weed when they came to Manchester beat that 🤣
Over the years I kinda grew out of them… don’t even listen to the old stuff that often anymore but this just put a smile on a teary-eyed face, thanks for that😘
🌶️🔥
<3
This song is so great, that it succeeded at bringing me back to the nostalgic early 2000s, while also keeping the essence of their 90s sound. And all this was created in the 20s of the new century🤣
Will Ferrell absolutely killed it on the drums! 🔥
please comeback my rock star band, oasis, foofighter, RHCP, greenday,
Love this band so much!! Always great to see them all together! Old bassTards! I love growing old with you guys! Watching my boy sing your songs makes me cry!! Thank you for being a part of the soundtrack of MY life!!! 🍻😷👍
IM EUPHORIC
3/2/2022 This was my birthday gift!! Thank u guys!! Red hot   forever!!
When they said that Jesus would come back to save the world I think they meant this. He's back :')
Muito amor envolvido ❤️
So will Ferrell is the video drummer or is this his work on drums as well?
CARALHO NUNCA FUI TRISTE

MANO MANO MQNO MANO
this is so good, it makes me nostalgic that they still maintain their essence
PQP LINDO DMS MANO
CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️❤️❤️❤️
Such a 60s vibe to this. I dig older Chili Peppers.
IIIHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
esses homens são o caralh@ msm
I already like it more than the first time I heard it :)
When did Danny Trejo become the RHCP singer?
Escuchando por enésima vez ;)
Ебануццца. Ну наконец-то!
드디어! 꿈에 그리던 멤버들이 모였네요. 이 감동을 말로 표현할 수 없을정도입니다.  너무 보고싶고 듣고싶던 프루시안테의 기타 플레이에 눈물이 나네요. 감사합니다 RHCP~
I love u guys 😍😍❤
Welcome back RHCP!
Incrível música espetacular 🤩👏
Yeeeeeaaahhhhhh 🤘🔥❤️
I wish I could like this more then once.
RHCP Getting old,but the taste still same
Good song, but kinda terribly produced and recorded. Did you guys all record your parts to a click track in your respective homes? Just go in a practice room, slap each other in the face to get hyped up, record a couple live takes and send it to someone on fivrr for mixing.
Anthony looks like a preliminary card UFC fighter.
Grandissimi, intramontabili dopo tutti questi anni ancora al top del top !!
Lets GOOOOOOOOO New rhcp album
No mention of California? 😭
Love the new 🎶 song!
The legends are back!
🤘🇹🇭
John OH John how I missed you!
Como les hacia fala John, una de las bandas desde que era niño. :)
I feel bad for klingenhoffer, the 2nd album they made together was awesome but now they sound like themselves again, can't wait for the new record.
La vuelta de un ídolo Frusciante, de la gran carajo 🇵🇾 saludos desde Paraguay
You know it's gonna be a good song when you see Keanu Reeves playing guitar...
🔥🌶
PERFEIIIITOOOOOSSSSSSSS
Can’t wait to see this live when the tour starts!
O Josh vendo que depois que ele saiu da banda eles voltam a fazer música com guitarra: 🤡
I’m 25 and this old guys in way better shape then me fml 🤦🏽‍♂️
Porra vou chorar kkk
More more more from RHCP thank you
I'm so glad I survived through this hard times to see this by the hand of my true love! Hope you love it wherever you are Jimbo ❤️
I was prepared to hate it. But i don't.
Kiedis rocking that Aaron Rodgers mustache.
Os chili pepers de volta a ativa
🤘
Muy bueeeno che aguanten los red
GRACIAS! Solo eso.
I was on the fence about this song at first, but, it's catchy AF and I've listened to it so many times this morning
Will Ferrell on drums.
This is closer to the sound of Stadium Arcadium than I expected it to be! But still undoubtedly evolved. I can't wait for the rest of the album and the tour.
Wow, really makes it clear how crucial John is for this band. This is better than anything they’ve put out since he left, and I’ll bet it’s not their best on the new album.
is that the bass player from Autobahn
Hacía mucha falta una canción de ustedes, grandes como siempre, Red Hot Chili Peppers hasta la muerte 🖤❤️🤍
dat mustache...
Кайфули
JOHN, EU TE AMO!
So excited to see them in Septmeber...and the new song was right on time!
classical Red classical Hot
After too much overthinking, I decided to buy 2 tickets to see them live with my boyfriend next June in Sevilla.  I am poor and it cost me, but I was so excited regardless of the money!! It was my brother who persuaded me that this would be a great investment, since we've all been burnin these guys' stuff for what...30 years? 40? Now they release something cool such us this... I couldn't be happier!!🥰🥰 It's gonna be a  long ass spring🤪
Larga vida a RHCP!
The peppers return w/ that classic legend style that gives such a rush!
Anthony really hit The zyzz pose?
вернусь сюда через 10 лет, когда эта песня станет олдовой классикой
Não tenho explicações para descrever oq estou sentindo escutando essa música.. É tão lindo, tão belo e tão bom de escutar.. Esses 4 caras juntos sabem oq fazem, obrigado chilipeppers!!❤
Californication drums, muito bom! Frusci de volta é inacreditável. Mal posso esperar pela turnê no Brasil!
I can't believe i'm alive to see this moment!!
Can't stop won't stop
Felicidad total!!! Los red hot nuevamente tocando juntos!!! 🥳🥳🥳
John fkin Frusciante .
hehe boi
how come all these old bands are so scared of their labels no songs about todays events  I find better music from new artist on YouTube such as Tom MacDonald  or Sampson
Great to see John back in the RHCP family! Gonna watch classic Chili Pepper clips the rest of the day haha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQVKfnkrmzw
Adorei 😍 Salve John! Salve Red Hot!

John 💚
This song is nice
INCRÍVELLLLLLLL
Eeee
otai masih berbisa🌶
*Lyrics*  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end It's been a long time and you nеver know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Focking solo from john is mother fuckiiiiing fruscianteee]  Crack the flaming whip A-sailin' on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Los que hacen música para escuchar toda la vida años y no de los que hacen música para escucharlos 3 veces y cansarte🔥🔥🔥
Flea 🔥best bassist in the world, good COMEBACK RHCP

A melhor banda de todas,com tantos anos de carreira continuam sendo fodas
Didn't know they parted ways with Klinghoffer.  Frusciante is really nice, no bad feelings. But I kinda liked Klinghoffer too. Maybe the 5 of them will someday make music together?
a new classic
There back people. The one and only rhcp!!! The amazing 4 back together at long last doing what they do best... Rocking out!!!!!!!!!!!
71 year old
Fuck yes! So excited for the album!
Tomara  que  estore cara
Estoy tan manijaaa, necesitaba escuchar a Frusciante rompiéndola así 😱😱😱 el paso del tiempo sólo los convierte en algo único, larga vida a RHCP !!! 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing, with so many years of career, they manage to keep the strong, which is their essence, the best band ever
So exciting watching you reunite again. Happy for you and all your fans

Thank you!
gracias por trabajar duro chicos, gracias por todo!
os cara é bom demaaaaais
❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
Наконец то вернулись полноценные нормальные соло на гитаре
Anthony, for the love of God and all things great and small. Please shave that mustache off and fix that hair cut !!! Dude i can't take that look anymore. Please Please Please. Otherwise the song was great as usual. Just mho. Rock the Fuck on !!!
Legit question, not trying to be a jerk: why does Anthony sound sorta Irish?
I love u, guys!
At last!!!
Ready for this album!!
3:28-/intro sphere  zoom buffet   mahogany  closet    lockup   glasshouse/
John, is that you?
Having gotten used to mammoth first singles like By the Way, Dani California, TAORDM, Dark Necessities, this is bit of a surprise to be honest. But i'm sure it'll grow on me. They always do. Long live RHCP!
JOHN ANTHONY MFING FRUSCIANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love you for infinity ❤️
Ese solo! brutal
🔥🔥
Anthony must be taking exogenous Testosterone.
待ってました!やっぱりカッコいい  また日本に来日公演に来てください 早く生でまた観たいです!
They are back bitches
Si chicos los mismos RHCP que hicieron cantar a un Wembley entero, y los proximos headliners de los próximos festivales del 2022 están de vuelta, estamos de vuelta en aquellos felices años chicos... disfrutemoslo
Épico!!!
Frusciante ❤️

GRATIDÃO, RHCP🙏🏾😍🇧🇷
Frusciante regreso como el Neo de la reciente Matrix, con look de John Wick a patear culos. Y que gallardía la de Anthony Kiedis de usar "mullet" en pleno 2022. RHCP are back bitches!
John might very well be the best guitarist alive today.
2023 esperamos vocês no BRASIL!!! <3
я рад возвращению нормальной музыки
Love the VIBE !!!!!
Esto es RHCP  señores!!  (Y)
"Su Maistru " John Frusciante Is back
When that damn album is dropping.....
yo
still legend
Parece que tudo no mundo se encaixa novamente, o sol voltou a brilhar. Red Hot sem o Frusciante é outra coisa. LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
Never clicked a video so fast... Frusciante is back, my god!!!
Preciso ir num show destes caras antes que seja tarde
Mano eu amava o josh mas o john voltando pra banda me da uma felicidade do krl
Flea kicks ass!!
Fuck I missed you John
Consistência é a palavra pra essa música, é essência de red hot para todo lado, é música nova, com pegada nova, mas com todo um vigor novo!
INCREDIBLE! The Chili Peppers are back! Also, Anthony's vocals are super cool in this.
They back!! A química da formação da banda, a mesma essência inconfundível depois de anos.. Go Peppers <3
gracias por salvar mi vida una vez más 🔥
I f*cking love you guys, thanks for your music.
Anthony has GOT to shave that shit off his face and grow his hair long again!!
John bravo👏👏👏
MEU DEUS ELES VOLTARAM LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
John, back when we need you the most.
A mais pura energia 🔥🌶️
Chorus got slow cheetah type vibes
vida longa a flea, anthony kiedis, john frusciante, chad smith e a todos que em algum momento tocaram nessa banda lendária! um salve especial a jack sherman e hillel slovak, que já estão no céu.  VIDA LONGA AO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! ♥️♥️♥️
Amo ❤️💪🏼
I can't wait to see them this summer, so happy John is back
Frusciante is back!! Heyyoo
Will Ferrell at the drums is a beast.
will wait for full album to pass judgment...but not feeling this  I can appreciate wanting John back in the band, but why couldn't you keep Josh as rhythm guitar
The genius is BACK! Shit, I'm so fucking happy
this is red hot chili peppers i know
Joe Exotic's new tracks are fire
Grande Diego Verdaguer
Starts kinda slow but picks up nicely.
Para John :  Gracias por existir  Gracias por no rendirte  Gracias por tu talento  Gracias por ser mi inspiración Gracias por volver a casa , extrañaba escuchar tu guitarra llorar   Te amo genuinamente John !
That Brown and all scratched Stratocaster felt where it belong in the RHCP. Missed John much!
That sound!!! Missed it so much!!!!
Wow piel de gallina 😍😍 los amo con el alma!. Gracias por tantooo
Estuve esperando 16 años este momento! Y fue como lo imaginaba un sonido bien Pepper, la guitarra de John la reconocés al instante.
Coisa maravilhosa 👏👏

Is this about our climate impact?

Please don't mention any states.
Amazing song! can't wait for the full album
Amazing!!!
It remember me “by the way” album times
RHCP ♥
Yo! This shit trippy af
🌶🌶🌶🌶
Мороз по коже, мощно!
It soo weird to see John Frusciante back…
Aaaaah, essa intro é muito foda! 🌶️❤️🌶️
los mejores! 🌶️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️
Maravilhoso. Frusciante é muito necessário ⚡
FODA PARA CARALHOOOOOO
The song is ok. I grew up in the 80s and can remember listening to Mothers Milk and the Blood Sugar. This song wouldn’t make the cut back then. I will say that Frusciantes guitarist is good. Bring back the funk/punk.
This is the most themselves they've sounded in years...
estos si son buenos días😵💜
Incrível!!!!
simplemente unos GENIOS
There's a melancholic vibe to it and I love it. I couldn't be happier that they're finally back!
Is he purposely going for the sea shanty sound in his vocals???
Пока выходят клипы РХЧП, я чувствую себя молодым!!!!!!
So glad Will Ferrel is back
Meu Red Hot tá vivo c@$#&%$
Una mierda, parece un malo b side de  by the way, josh klinghoffer era el resurgir de los peppers, ahora con la novia vieja es más de lo mismo
Thank God for Frusciante coming back & sounding as Good as Ever!!!
Sounds like 90's RHCP... the best RHCP era.
ВДОХНОВЛЕННОЕ СПАСИБО, ДУШЕВНЫЕ «РЭД ХОТ ЧИЛЛИ ПЭППЕРЗ»! ТАК ДЕРЖАТЬ! С БОГОМ!
ABRACADABRALIFORNIAAA!!!
This is like a sea shanty song played through an electric guitar. I love it! Lol
I've been very much looking forward to this new album. I'm diggin' this song. John's cords have a mid to late '60's vibe with his spin mixed in. I know that I've heard a classic song with something similar sounding. Stay 🌶🌶🌶🌶 FUNKY and FRESH 🌶🌶🌶🌶💗💗💗💗🤘😁🤘☮
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ALWAYS IN MY SOUL
Hmmm not that great. Considering Rick Rubin is behind it. Pretty basic stuff.  It's ok not bad just not wow. Hope there's some heavier riffs on the new album like the fantastic Blood Sex Sugar record. See that tour with Rollins Supporting 🤘
Sonido puro red hot como se nota la guitarra de frusciante brutal🤘
Unlimited love to all of you!  ∞💕
13 years ago, when Frusciante left the band I had just started playing guitar and he was my main hero. I almost cried when I heard the news but told myself with sadness and hope "Maybe he will come back some day, maybe 10 years from now, I'll just try to forget about it (never did)". In 2019, ten years later, he came back when I was in the middle of an emotional crisis, that was the best news on december. And now, three years later I finally get to hear them together again. Thanks RHCP, thanks John. Now I will have new songs to learn on my guitar. I never stopped playing because of you, now you'll play for me once more.
Frusciante e Flea... Gods
That's guitar 🎸🤌🏼🤌🏼❤️❤️
Song: 10/10 Anthony's moves: 200/10
Jhon is back!!! Hasta en la forma de acabar la guitarra en el ultimo segundo del video  se nota que es él!!
shit.....the true genre of rhcp is always put in...tq
ver a jhon en red hot de nuevo es como cuando le ponias un mod a gta y te dejaba tener a superman, es SURREAL. amo la vida un poco mas desde hoy.
LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🖤
jonh wick at the guitar , awesome.
Frusciante bringing the gnarly back! #JohnFrusciante #RedHotChiliPeppers
😎
John "motherf*ck*ng" Fruciante
Excelente tema , ver a john nuevamente junto a los demás es genial  , los 4 hacen un equipo increíble
Why am I getting straight "Island Boys" vibes from the vocals?
Os homens voltaram muito forte!!
Few seconds intro, looks like The lord of the rings!!
Sounds suspiciously like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers
Sou apaixonada pelo RHCP desde 2002, quando ganhei o álbum By the Way de presente de aniversário de 9 anos
Black 🤘🖤
China's on the derk side of the moooon
like old RHCP !!
Fakking LEGENDS. Already listened it 10 times. LOVE THEM.
Like it! :)
Black Summer !!!!!! Is Super awesome

0:30-/intro mug rise Typhoid Mary  cockcrow gallows-bird  flapper den  riser  air pit/
c"est le son des Red Hot Chili Pepper que l'on aime
Caramba muito massa, há mais de 10 anos esperando por isso ! Agradeço a Deus por estar vivo pra ver essa volta ! Viva RED HOT !!!!
John IS using his all times classic Strat right? It looks so classy, lady guitar
Anyone else has noticed Vladimir Lenin on Flea’s bass guitar? :)
Nice to see ragetti from pirates of the Caribbean leaving that lifestyle behind and forming a band
that original red hot essence is back.
Been a fan for 34 years!!🤘❤🤘
Esto es hermosooooo 😭😭😭
Feels like Something is back that i used to have before
Amo amo amo ❤ ❤ 🇧🇷🇧🇷

Killer song
Can’t wait for the rest of the album!!!
Just something about Frusciante and how he hits those chords. Love to see him back , love the song can’t wait for the album. 🤘🏻
Awesome!  We're waiting you at Rock in Rio Brazil 2022.
cool
My soul feels so full seeing this!!
Я один заметил Ленина на басу Фли ?
все еще достойны
This chorus isn’t epic enough to look past the weird annunciation of lyrics in the verses.
OMG.... 😱 Que música.... A essência do RHCP.... É pra curtir sem parar ...
It’s not bad at all, 7/10 for me, still got that chilli peppers feel and it’s great John is back, looking forward to the new album.
Thank u so much!
Came here to see John.

First Tobey Maguire comes back as Spider man, now John fruciante
YEEEEES! John Frusciante is back <3
NUNCA FUI TRISTE
Thank youuuu Anthony, John, Flea and Chad ;-)
estoy acá desde la madrugada qué temazo por favorrr
Red Hot Chilli Peppers influenciou uma juventude absurda no Brasil nos anos 90/2000, surfistas, roqueiros, fãs de rap, skatistas, pixadores, todos amavam demais essa banda que marcou aqui no BR principalmente nas eras Californication e By The Way onde minha geração conheceu por meio dos clipes maravilhosos na extinta MTV.   E que me desculpem os outros guitarristas que a banda teve mas não existe comparação com a musicalidade que o Frusciante agrega na banda como um todo, feliz de ver tantos comentários de jovens brasileiros que corriam pra casa pra assistir o clipe de californication na MTV e até hoje esperam o jogo, um grande abraço a todos e vida longa ao RHCP!
Sounds like he was influenced by “I’m an island boii” 🏝 🏴‍☠️
Sounds like they cherry picked elements of various other chili peppers songs kinda like how Dark necessities was a redo of can't stop. Catchy chorus tho and John lifts the whole thing. Looking forward to the album coming out
It's like the drummer just used the drum track from Dani California.
Muito fod*!!!
A grower, not a shower
i'ma simple man. i see rhcp.i clicked like.  missing rock songs for too long
La misma energía, magia, actitud, talento de siempreee. <3 ¡¡¡Los mejores!!!
Love the chili peppers but man watchin this video just makes me feel old......but they sound just as fresh as ever which is uplifting.
LOVE ❤️ RHCP 🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
These guys are like ACDC- same songs in a different arrangement every time. Sticking with the formula
if stadium arcadium was so good, then why is there no stadium arcadium 2?         oh...
😍😍😍
Love the more psychedelic RHCP sound
como é bom ter um guitarrista de oficio de volta na banda kkkk
I LOVE GUYS!!!!
QUE FODAAA
Great Song Guys! 🤘🤜🤛👊
i felt a nice 60's / 70's vibe from the intro/verse guitar and bass. really good shit guys. welcome back john
This is the only band formation that really works. Frusciante is a bigger game changer everytime he comes backs! Navarro was cool, but that wasnt them. Frusciante is King!\ and they know it!
More of the same, boring
This is the 5th time they've made this goddamn song. If this is what they're leading the album with I'm worried.
Now the band is complete with the return of Frusciante.
Sounds like recycled RHCP that didn't make the cuts from their older albums. I hope the rest of the album is better.
Que alegría me genera volver a ver a Frusciante en la banda. Temazo con toques psicodélico tanto en lo musical como en el vídeo, y verlo con su camisa a cuadros es como que nunca se hubiera ido... eterno adolescente!!!
Oh yes , the guitar is back! And what a  guitar!
Vida longa ao RHCP 🌶🔥
JOHN IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally
Ca fait plaisir de voir les red hot au complet !!! Et ce solo🔥🔥🔥
Amo demais 😭😭😍 nuuuuuuu
Bem-vindos de volta 💙
Stadium Arcadium Flashbacks <3
Chad left Chickenfoot to do this?
A maior banda de rock do mundo em atividade voltou !!
Music to my ears, thank you!!!🥰
Ahhhhh 😍 PQP VEY 😭
Just like Anthony said in this song I’ve been waiting and I relate to that.
Will Ferrell has become a pretty great drummer.
Music Video
Thank You!

The boys are back!
oh, hi guys!!!
Watched this ten times already
roloooonon el inicio es totalmente under the bridge con el utoooo amoo de Frusciante carajo!!!
Seeing John in the band again it feels.... like he never left... it just fits.  Anthony looking more and more like Iggy Pop these days. Can't wait to hear the new full album.
Not their best work by a long shot but still truly brilliant. Seeing John back behind the axe, I'm going to fuckin' cry.
❤
i dont know how i feel to this song ......so i listen again and again maybe 20times......but still i want to listen again ^@%$#$%^&*^&*

Does anyone ever know what Anthony is talking about
Amazing guitar solo 😍🤌🎸

Wow...sure hope the rest of the album is better
🖤🖤🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🎶🎶🎶♥️♥️
Holy fucking shit <3333333333333
Their last two albums were good, but Stadium Arcadium was excellent. I'm so glad Frusciante is back for their new album Unlimited Love. So beyond ecstatic.
my boy is back
Mais atual que nunca ... Show ...
King's flea ia back 🍻
Omg😢
Voy a llorar😭
MAGIC  💫
Holy shit, the music video is on point.
Anthony Kiedis ruins this track, cheesy lyrics with awful wordplay topped with a terrible irish lilt.
Os brabos estão de volta!!!
just fucking awesome

I burst out crying. It's been too long, we needed this. <3
Welcome back John🔥🔥🔥
This is a nice birthday present Thanks! :D
Am I the only one who liked more the style of music they had with Josh Klinghoffer? I don’t know, this one right here looks a lot like their old albums with Frusciante and I kinda liked that they had updated their beat and rhythm when Josh was in the band. It felt more fresh, contemporary but authentic RHCP signature style at the same time.
John's still got it! Anthony, not so much...
Já faz 20 anos que fui a um show do Red Hot! 😳 continuam fazendo música boa! 🤘🏻 e já pareço mais velho que o Anthony haha!
So good.
Always knew they’d get back together ❤️ like if you agree
Black Summer but Bright Day. Today. Thanks guyz!
This is kind of crap lol
FruscianteGOD
❤❤❤
They put so much work in it
This is classic RHCP! A classic RHCP clip (and with these 90's chroma vibe), classic Kieds' weird dancing, classic Frusciante's riffs and solos in perfect harmony with the bass, which is delivered to us by classic Flea's convulsing pluckin', all backed by a classic Chad's drum ride... Thank u for that!
es como ver a los dioses regresar al olimpo
Is Anthony rocking a mullet?
LET's GO!!!
I feel like meeting an old friend. Tears in my eyes….
Thanks RCHP, Thanks John!!
Same energy, same old souls... They'r never gettin' old, we'r never gettin' old. Hurraayyyy 😄🥳🥳🥳😊🤘
I had a dream last night I helped John Frusciante button up his flannel shirt and I woke up to this. The BFG is hard at work.
Oh my <333
hes looking like the guy from skimos cowboys mc hammer
🔥 огонь,жгут Отцы
Looks like Anthony has been taking martial arts lessons from Mac.
John John John, this is what we need! So excited to see you live 🇧🇷🙌
Говнище💩
Great music!  can't wait for the full album
It's always a good day when the chillis drop a new tune 🎶🎶🎶
Teve idiota q falou q parecia b side kkkkk o cool de quem disse.rhcp é veia pro coração ❤  .frusciante é o porteiro do céu
Bruh ive been listening this all day long. This is f**in dope. They re all back at their prime.  When people realize, the video will blow up.
Give it more and more listens, you'll love it progressively more!
I'm so glad johns back

Will ferrel on fire
This song is trendy yet very "RHCP". SO ADDICTIVE! And i love that they always make very high-quality music videos.  사랑해용 할배들💖
Sin duda hermosa.
Frusciante is back!!!
we need a sea shanty version badly
Very good to see Frusciante back , this band is everything , what nostalgia , I love you , keep giving us your amazing songs , long live Red Hot Chili Peppers 🤘🏼❤️🌶️
The sound of California. Not bad for a bunch of old farts, lol.
Klinghofferisation?
I love it my new favorite song
Just took better times,for this,found it powerful with, it's traits, electrifying, bass, vocal, and the drummer, just got hooked, at 2336,malaysia
Antony cortate ese pelo por favor corte taza
Ultimately, this sums up the last two years, but you know what hope can bring so much as can patience, believe me I know x
Esa última parte del video con la toma de los 4 tocando juntos, es como volver a tener 10 años y escucharlos por primera vez , una vez más.
The red hot chilli pepers✌🏽
wowwww 🔥🙌
Como é bom ouvir RHCP de novo ♥️
Anthony with questionable hairstyles and great vocals, Will Ferrel on drums, Flea rocking that bass and most importantly, John Frusciante killing it with his patented guitar riffs. RHCP still at their best!
Lol I'm convinced that this guy literally doesn't ever wear a shirt
I love you more than my mom
Frusciante love
Hoy cumplo 30 años, gracias a las coincidencias de la vida 🙌! Vengan a Argentina por favor! 😎🤟🏽🇦🇷🙉
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Carai mto foda
1million views in 10 hours. The Frusciante effect
They are back! This is awesome! Its got Scar Tissue vibes! Long live the RHCP!!!
Fuck yes!!! Can't believe this... Finally you return back the City of Angels where you always been. Welcome back King of LA
It's shocking how much better John Frusciante makes this band.
Damn that solo is fire!! Sounds like Cali' era Boss FZ-2 and DS-2 fuzzy goodness :))))
Finalmente  Dps da trollagem de ontem
Still wish Anthony Kiedis and Brandon Boyd of incubus would collaborate ...
Red HOTTT chilli pepper ROCKISBAKKKK
nah
All due love and respect to Hillel Slovak and the guitarists who've replaced him in this band over the years, but RHCP is at their most magic when John Frusciante's in the mix. LOVELY to see this.
Que buena música  🤘
Like it but what's with the Canadian voice?
Cuando estos 4 se juntan nada puede salir mal 😺
🌶️
Flea in the suicide forest (2022)
❤️
Still keeping it tight. The flow of RHCP still flows like the stream that ain't gonna stop now for sure... YES RHCP!!! "it's been a long time and you never know when",I've been waiting!!!
I’m so glad red hot chili peppers have never changed they’re amazing and always will be
JOHN IS GOD
Someone explain to me why you can hear the first 10 seconds and immediately know it’s Frusciante
I was waiting for that day!!! The red hot is one of my favorite band since I was 13 years old. So happy to have John Frusciante,was missing him. This album feels like an old one but in a good way. That’s what I needed ! Thank you !
Thanks guys, you are awesome! I've been your fan since I was 13, now I'm 22. An unusual song for you, but I really liked it. The visual part is also so cool.  Please come to Poland or Belarus.
WELCOME BACK!
Pra não perder o costume: fraco.
Listen boys don't cry by Anitta

Diego Verdaguer-Kieds !! no ha muerto ! !  buena rola , de 7 esperemos el album en abril....
Nice to see Will Ferrell behind the drums still! LOL! And Keanu Reeves on guitar!!
That solo though..man I forgot how much I love frusciante’s guitar work!
es nuevo..per se siente noventero
sailing on a censorship, love it
Simply good! Red Hot Chili Peppers is quality! Perfect!
Nostaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagia ele voltou
I've missed those backup vocals since 2007...  Nothing can express how happy my soul is on the inside
Why does he sound Irish?
John F. Anthony is back, beaches and peaches. Waiting for the album
Can’t mistake RHCP’s sound. Beautiful as always. Great work and excited to hear the rest of the album. 🌶❤️‍🔥🤘🏻

FRUSCIANTEEEEE
Sensacional. Não tem nem como tentar explicar... o feeling dos 4 integrantes é orgânico, natural e envolvente. Que musicalidade incrível.
the solo and the outro, damn!! John "motherfucking" Frusciante its back!!!!!!!!
Será que só eu que não gostei deste single? Esperava muito mais do primeiro single. Mas ainda to ansioso pelo álbum inteiro.
Still the voice is quite enticing  after a decade.
This is a Masterpiece!
Love❤
Brutaaal

That fuzz in a strat is super sick! 👌 Epic RHCP as always.
John Frusciante!
Que vaibe !!!!
You guys still got it.
Thanks for all RHCP
RHCP are the musical representation of efficiency and consistency.
Yeeeeeeeeeah!
hola, acabo de sacar 10 en cálculo, creo, y quiero jugar básket
Unreal- RHCP just makes me vibe! Just awesome.
Great song, but Anthony Kiedis was distracting me looking like Luigi.
AAAAAA PERRONSISISISISIMAAA
IH
llevo más de 9 años esperando volverlos a ver juntos, y es mágico, emocionante. Me trae nostalgia, gracias por tanto amor al público y gracias por tanta música, gracias Chili Peppers y gracias John.
This ain’t it
The presence of these guys together transcends their music. It defines two generations growth and merger into one single lifelong essence. We started listening when we were young and now that we’re old, and they’re back to jamming together again, it’s like our youth will carry on so long as theyre together…the soundtrackers of our lives. Thank you.
Frusciante is fire!
O solo dos deuses meu pai, obg por tudo!
Fuck yea
Depois de anos pedido o homem, ele voltou. Aí sim. Vida longa aos pepers
Lindoooooo tudo perfeito,a guitarra do John é inconfundível Flea como sempre naquela loucura boa demais a voz do Anthony doce e forte o Chad monstro na batera enfim eles voltaram com tudooooo🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️ I Love youuuuuu @redhotchilipeppers
бля, это оухуено! жалко только что джоша выпнули(
John is back, cant be wrong
Long life to Red Hot Chili Peppers!!
Anthony O'Kiedis'  lack of singing ability in full force here. And when did get become Irish?

One million views already holy fuck
❤️

OOOOOTSSSS 😤😤😤
待ってた…
Keidis comin’ in hot with the mullet 🔥 I cannot wait for August. This show is gonna be 🔥 🤘
This brings back so many memories... and yet is a new single in 2022 from RHCP. Incredible. Legends.
Another great RHCP tune.. just a pity that the video looks like it belongs to U2...
Legend is legend.
YEEEEESSSSSSS 6 Years since the last RHCP album…  AFTER 16 YEARS…  *JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK WITH THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS…*    *It almost feels like a psychedelic dream…* 🤘🏽🌶
It's amazing to see RHCP not incorporating post rock elements and still overtaken the fellow seniormost bands in the race of existence.
Can't wait to hear this live!!!!
Did they ever get out of the 90's? It would appear not.
🔥🔥🔥
amazing
Kings!
The goats 🐐
🧡
I'm not sure why he singing like a pirate in the first couple verses, but the rest of the song is pretty good.
my favorite lineup of rhcp is back together! probably the most enjoyable musical event in the last 15 years!
Awesome video!!! Walking on the clouds waiting to find a black summer to end.
Welcome back 🖤🖤🖤
the king is back!
Red Hot Chili Peppers não é uma banda não, é mais que isso, é uma serie, é um universo expandido é muita emoção ! só quem é fã de verdade sabe a importancia desses caras na vida da pessoa. EU TE AMO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS !!!! QUE BOM QUE VOCES VOLTARAM ! AMOR SEM LIMITES !
At first, I didn’t like it. But it grows on you.
SON LO MEJOR QUE ME PASO EN LA VIDA VUELVAN A ARGENTINA🇦🇷

Man this is so fucking cool. Im so happy right now. We need more .

A song that had to grow on me. Didnt clicked on the first time but after a few listenings i like that song a lot !!! <3   Fuck, John is back guys; and you can hear it at an instant! Super excited for the concert in Cologne Germany.
Is it me, or has Anthony developed an Irish accent in the verse?
Привет, пацаны! Скучал по вам! Перцы ещё жгут! :-)
Incrível como Frusciante mantém a essência da banda.
Sick solo
I FUCKING LOVE THEM
Now, I can dead in peace…
Classic Chilli Peppers in a modern twist. Love it
Someone should tell Flea, that aging is a mandatory necessity for every human being.  You must not  just ignore  and stop that.
It’s incredible that we can still hearing RHCP music. A gift x our lives!!!! ❤️🌶
Muse - new album incoming with old hard sound, RHCP - new album incoming with Frusciante's back with his guitar magic. 2022, I'm lovin it!
Can Anthony stay with his T-shirt on in a music video for 1 minute?
🐙🌶
We need a Remaster of Californication
This is amazing! I love this guys! 20 years of pure love!
Good to see and hear ya John
Pure joy in my smile while i'm watching this.
MRNA zombies..

Alright fella's.  Life's complete.   🙏💯❤️
Legends
Well great, now that producer kid will blow up
After John's departure on their last album together, I have always dreamt that one day they will be together again. The moment that I knew that John is back with the Chilli Peppers, my dream came true. Thank you for this magical moment. Can't wait for their live jam. Flea and John chemistry is truly magical!!!
Дождались!  С возвращением, старые добрые перчики. Рад, что Фрушанте снова в деле)
yeah, this made me smile
<3
MEMORIES ARE CREATING WHAT THE FUUUCK
No pierdo la esperanza de que vengan a Perú 🇵🇪
caracaaaaaa RHCP 4Ever
Has Anthony Kiedis done a Men's Health interview or anything? How does this dude stay in shape at 59 years old?
Classic Red Hot Chilli Peppers 🤙
Omg how I missed it!
alm, esta bien chidaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. john frusciante GOD, Flea GOD, Anthony GOD y Chad GOD
COME TO BRAZIL
I didn't expect to be jammin to a brand new RHCP song at 7AM in the morning, but I'm glad it worked out that way :)
RHCP is one of my favorite classic bands I listened to welcome back guys!! 🎸🎸🥁🎤🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
VOLVIERON EL MEJOR CUARTETO AMEN !  AMEEEEE <3 <3 <3 <3
So nice to see John back with the boys ❤️
Thank you
I hope the world understands the message deep
NAAAAAH
I have a hard time focusing on the music; Anthony's hair and moustache are just so distracting.
Un pur son.vivement l album .un bijou
1:51 the man is back
16 años esperando este momento! Sois enormes! ❤❤❤❤
This is such a beautiful song, the more you listen to it the more you fall in love with it , this will be one epic album. RHCP are back w/ Frusciante “The GOAT” ❤️
Лучшая группа современности!
Aging like a fine wine
¡¡¡¡GRACIAS. Saludos desde México!!!!!

FRUSCIANTE IS BACK!!!!!
Yes!!! I've been waiting 14 years for this 😭😭😭
Good to see them realise something new :)
Tremendo 🔥🔥🔥💣💣 la mejor banda de todos los tiempos.
I‘m missing Josh :-(
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE
As Michael Scott would put it: "My heart is very full at this moment"
Bela bosta... infelizmente como o esperado. Sucesso e conforto são inimigos mortais do rock.
JOHN IS GOD!
I fucking love you guys 🖤🥰
Anthony Leprekiedis! What the hell was that shit? Pretty damn trash
Song sucks
Anthony has a pirate vibe with the way he says his “r”s. Most legendary band of all time.
ONE LOVE! thank you!
Восхитительное возвращение :3  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RHCP!!! good song
Diego Verdaguer no esta muerto! Es el vocalista de los Red!
HE is back 🥺🥺
The Legend is BACK
¡¡¡Sensacional!!! Hermosos solos de Frusciante. ¡Yeah!
Yawn. Another formulaic chilli peppers song. 😴💤
I'm kinda disappointed at this. John is so much better. I think maybe its gonna take an album to get them back in the groove, and the vocals at the beginning are rough also. Feels rushed to me
I was expecting something more. Was excited to hear a progression and all we got was the same old Chili Peppers from 2005.
Now that’s a birthday present!
Kick a hole in the sky  Real men don't kill coyotes Personal favs
Rolazaaaaa!!!
Gratidão por estarem de volta!
Sounds like a RHCP b-side, I need to check the lyrics now
PQP ISSO TA MUITOOOOO BOMMMMMMMM
Creo que voy a llorar por mucho tiempo, pero de Alegría al verlos juntos de nuevo, RHCP for ever!!!
Those tamales 🌶️are red hot 🥵! Yeah, they got 'em for sale!   ✳️ Love 💕 it fellaz!!!
I know RHCP couldn’t care less about my opinion, still I feel this is one of their weaker songs. I like the modal mixture and ambiguity it presents, top notch production value, all good. But it’s not hitting home, the climax feels washed out. Maybe that’s the point- but why not go all out and put some blood sugar sex magic twist on it or sth? I dunno maybe that’s the point, making us feel indifferent and a little lost but hopeful, and that’s a representation of how the band feels after frusciante coming back and them not wanting to overrepeat themselves and they wanna progress and whatnot... we will see. Still: frusciante back- instant goosebumps
Os caras continuam BONS PRA CARAMBA!!! Eu sou um apaixonado pelo RHCP desde 1990 quando meu irmão Rodriguinho, morto em 93, me "aplicou" num som que entrou na minha vida, correu pelas minhas veias, bagunçou minha mente e fez casa no meu coração pra eu nunca mais deixar sair! Vida longa ao RedHot...👏🏻😎🤟🏻
Escucho a los Red Hot desde que estaba en la panza de mi mamá, y esta hermosa canción me hace acordar al sonido de Californication y a By the way, que alegría volver a escuchar la guitarra de John de vuelta después de tanta espera ♥️ Los amo Red Hot son parte de mis sentimientos ♥️ saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷
Dark necessities > This. Yeah I said it
JOHN IS BACK
Só coroa gatooooo kk ❤️❤️❤️
Ainda bem que ainda estou vivo para ver isso!
fantastico
Yeah!! Will Ferrel drumming at his best
Un grazie dall'Italia per questo nuovo singolo!
Que alegria ver os quatro juntos ❤️❤️❤️❤️ RCHP é vida!!🌶️
It's really amazing how they pass from a relax intro to a great riff.😎👌
oof I missed Johns magic this sounds so good
Absolute masterpiece can't wait to see them live
It's so beautiful, these men connect so well musically and spiritually. How wonderful, the brotherly love will always be there, the Unlimited Love these men held will echo with this new album. This is why I still listen to R.H.C.P, they're bond is so strong and we're gifted with their art. So grateful to be part of this masterpiece.❤
I expected much more. Kinda dissapointed ngl
Beautiful never lose the eseence always the best Style and quallity music
Always love Chad Smith drum sound 🥰
Isso é literalmente RHCP, se tu ouviu e não voltou no tempo, tá ouvindo errado. It's so amazing 🔥
John 🤩
It's OK imo. However i feel the chorus is the weakness part which is a problem.
You guys have been away for far too long.  Welcome back! We miss you so much! ❤️
Grande los Red Hot 🇨🇱 Peppers!!!
I love Will Ferrell on drums!
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE           slow version!!!
Your Unreal Engine is showing
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷✌🏼🖤
Una cancion decente.
Is Anthony singing with an accent on the verse? The band sounds great as usual. Welcome back John!
Still young
Garbage
牛逼！
개조아 존나 멋있어 존나 그냥 짱 최고 일등 변함없어 사랑해
Hanno fatto il compitino...
O som ta batenooo certooo. E John é foda <3
Gracias infinitas, Que belleza y privilegio seguir escuchando canciones que te tocan el alma, ayer hoy y siempre 😭😍
New album! MY BODY IS READYDWDHJBNDDFHHKJBG
Man. Missed their unique guitar sounds
Funny how this is the only band to come out the musical shift still alive.
John i love you sir... ❤️❤️❤️ you always inspire me..
John Wick na guitarra

I absolutely Love Love Love you guys!!   I do believe its about to end!  👑👑👑👑🔥💕 Lets Gooooo!
Johns background vocals and beautiful guitar is back. Oh an Rick is back producing. Am I in heaven?
Sweeeeeeet lord of peppers!!!! This is freaking insane! 🔥🌶️
Good song!  ...but Damn! Anthony! Loose the pornstache!
Se um dia eu fui triste, não me lembro. Perfeição demais isso aqui. <3
Tan sublime :3 simplemente los rhcp esa sinergía que se manejan 😊
Oh yeahhh 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Bass
A good-if-not-GREAT song IMO, although certainly a step back in the right direction with the return of Mr. Frusciante. Hopefully the rest of the album will not disappoint, either.
John looks amazing for 51
Vamos por delante de Rosalía, todavía queda esperanza 💪

Damn ! So good!
Anthony and this gang forever lov🤍
It's finally happening 😱
Just right!  Well done.
This is horrible, does chad smith know any other beats??? He just does freestyle drum solos or plays californication under the new music
Long life Jhon frusciante viva RHCP!!! Que vibe poder ver todos juntos de novo
Que emoción da cuando la banda saca nuevos temas. Siguen teniendo la esencia con las nuevas canciones. Vengan a Ecuador 🇪🇨 RHCP
Miss you Josh.
Y regresó Frusciante a salvar el mundo con sus riffs noventeros.
We've all been waiting
Flea+Chad+Anthony+John = bliss :))
Diangelo is killing it on the drums
Prime example of how a band can destroy themselves from within singing this stupid woke shit🤮
Hermoso!!!
Toujours aussi bg mes vies
Today's my birthday and this song is the best gift I could've ever imagined... Thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers! 🖤
Sempre fico contando em que momento eles dizem California! haha
✌️
Black summers matters
Good to see John frusciante back with the RHCP
Es normal el querer llorar?
yes, super dope... Real Chili peppers sound.. the more i listen to it, the more i love it !!
Oh yeah!
Barney: ¡queremos a los Chili Peppers! 🕯🤘
This is nothing but pure love
One love mothers fuckers I love each of you enjoying this. I have been hyped so long this is so meaningful and religious to my life. If you feel the same give me a hell yeah I think I’m on a my 400 500th listen since the leak then the video hell yeah fuck it was 2/4/22 hell yeah mothers
GRANDES COMO SIEMPRE LOCO
No aguardo das outras musicas!
John went from John Frusciante to looking like John Wick
LO MEJOR PARA EMEPZAR MI DÍA ES VIENDO EL PRIMER VIDEO OFICIAL DEL RETORNO DE FRUSCIANTE
Шедеврально!!! В своем стиле!!!
Ouch ! my ears are bleeding .
alta colaboración de will ferrel con esa batería <3
Reminds me of a song that missed the cut on Stadium Arcadium. The Chorus has a "Slow Cheetah" cadence to the vocal melody from what I can hear. Still really enjoyable to me.
If any negative reviews surface I'll be surprised because I won't be able to comprehend where they're coming from. This is what  you'd expect from this legendary band. Plus which, frusciante back in the fold. What's not to love? The chili's are back after 6 long years :)
Voy a llorar
This song makes me wish RHCP covered locomotive breathe
OMG A NEW SONG!! AFTER ALL THIS TIME!?
John Frusciante appreciation comment!!
просто мёд!
The fact Anthony still has this shape at 59 is fucking impressive. This dude is a legend
🐬
Not being racist or nationalist, I'm just wondering why are there so many spanish(not sure) comments??
Se essa música não é um absurdo nada mais é...
I don't really understand what Anthony is going for with his vocal tambre in the verses. It almost sounds like whatever effects the intro guitar went through also got applied to his verse vocals or something.
A ansiedade era tanta, que som que massa! Muito top! Estava com saudade de musicas novas, e ainda mais com a cara do John!
Me gustaría mucho ver esta canción entre las ultimas del disco, me parece que quedaría muy bien como penúltima
Que contento me pongo con un disco de estos moustros!!! Viva! 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Oh John 🙌🏻
E lá vou eu gastar dinheiro...
Como puede ser que me sorprendan siempre, desde los 12 los escucho, hoy con 32 acá sigo, mas manija que nunca!!!!!
Larga vida a los Red Hot Peppers 🍻
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE

от t2x2, песня ахуенная
❤️
Fuck yeah they brought will Ferrell back!!!!!
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO ❤️🤘
John Frusciante, ich kann's kaum glauben 😍 klingt sehr nach dem klassischen Chili Peppers Sound, vor allem der Gitarrenpart 💪🏻
its been a long time! i1ve been waiting S2
they seem to like kung fu....  me too it s good practising
Everything sounds SO GOOD here..... MASTERPIECE that's just it
LOVE U JOHN 😻😻😻😻😻
Шикарно
Always in love wt RHCP <3
Black Summer is here!
Thank fuck ❤️
incrível a habilidade deles em manter a essência, mas não ficar na mesmice
Caraio Anthony Kiedis 60 anos bem distribuídos hein quero eu chegar aos 60 assim !!!!!!
I'm just not sure about Anthony's moustache.
All it needed was an extra epic guitar solo at the end to elevate us into space
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
음악 진짜 너무 좋다. 하루종일 듣고 있다.  제발 한국에도 와주세요!
a melhor banda de todos os tempos!!! não consigo explicar a alegria de ver o John junto com o resto da banda novamente. Obrigado por isso!!!
They so white for modern USA?)
Red Hot Chili Peppers, junto a AC/DC y The Beatles, son las 3 bandas que me llevaron al rock, y con los años, he oído toda su discografía, desde Slovak, Frusciante, Navarro y Klinghoffer  Solo puedo decir que ellos me han acompañado, en mis momentos felices, en mis locuras, en mis tristezas y derrotas, y tras 5 años desde The Getaway, 16 desde Stadium Arcadium, hoy los Chili Peppers suenan como aquella primer vez ❤️ Long live to RHCP
woke up adn started pounding my bed like an ape when i saw this was out
Que lindo volver a escucharlos !!!  bienvenido john !!! ...
Мы все так этого ждали!
Frusciante está aquí señores
John de volta coisa linda
😍
True to yourselves always - thank you for another great installment I love You all with my whole heart 💜
Hmmmmm 🤔
Ни о чем
nuevo album POR FIN¡¡¡¡¡¡
Parece uma música reciclada do Stadium Arcadium, sinceramente a música é bem fraca, Anthony com essas melodias fracas, os backing-vocals são a mesmisse do Stadium e By the Way, que são discos fracos com alguns pontos altos, prefiria bem mais uma vibe Im With You e The Getaway, com o Josh, achei que o John traria a vibe do Blood Dugar ou Mothers Milk, mas não rolou...
Can we just point out how good will Ferrell is on the drums 😆
this sounds like a rhcp song
Luar Biasa  Indonesia~
Golden age has passed imo, but i'm still really happy to see them back with our beloved John <3
JOHN FRUSCIANTE AAAAAAAA
Definitely sounds like a rhcp song, not sure if I love it but I definitely don’t dislike it. Not a huge fan of the video tho
My god, don't knew Keanu Reeves join for lead guitar.
someone did their shadow work
Nunca mueran! siempre en nuestros corazones! gracias por esta obra de arte!
Es increíble vivir una época de ellos. Desde los 80s haciendo música, y aunque no haya nacido ahí, con mis 17 años, oirlos es todo un placer :'3. Gracias RHCP por existir :')
Still.. how sexxxy they are!😍
CHILIS 4EVERRRRR
Musica top demais, essencia do RHCP ta viva !
Me hicieron revivir la sensación de escuchar Californication por primera vez!!! Gracias!!!
Ahh nothing better than seeing Frusciante back!!🤘
I can't believe this is actually happening!!!
Simplesmente incrível !  Acabei de lançar a tradução dela para uma melhor experiência ;)
Never ever leave us again John
That's the guitar and bass cooperation we missed. Can't wait to hear more!
A relief to all the trash thats being played right now in the radio.
Putos dioses
Христос воскресе!
The return of music gods. Kiedis with mullet is my religion.
PERFEITO! MEU AMIGO, PERFEITO! NÃO HÁ NADA MELHOR DO QUE OUVIR UM RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS COM JOHN DE VOLTA 😍🤘🏼🤌🏼
Tankyou 🇧🇷
Good day guys so good to see you again happy that John is back on the team love it ❤️❤️❤️
whang shu and the 10 rings ???? i saw it   this week..
My goodness, yessssssssssss!😍😍😍 I love you forever,  RHCP! ❤💛💚💙💜🖤💖
FUCK YEEEAHHHH listen to that frusciante guitar !!! I AM SO STOKED FOR AUGUST
Simple the best band  red  hot  chili peppers 🌶
I like this. I feel like it has a very original vibe to it, especially the verse melody
Million hell yeah 100k a hour hell yeah world
The return of the king, welcome back John!
esa Strato ctm!!!!!! verla ya es hermoso porque sabes como sonara
Gracias por todo muchachos

Beautiful 🔥👏
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Masterpieceness!
This is surreal
Hermoso, Rhcp toda la vida... Felicidades desde Perú... Espero vuelvan pronto... Los amo... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So damn good to have you guys back.  Thanks for keeping rock and roll alive, and for inspiring all of the little unsigned rock bands who grew up on your music (like us.).
They should stop making music.
With no disrespect to Mr. Slovak, there should have never be any other guitarist for this band than John Frusciante..
Es como ver a los dioses regresar al olimpo
😻😻😻😻😻😻
É maravilhoso ver que o rhcp nunca muda a essência e, agora com o frusciante de volta que ficou mais foda ainda!
All hale John Frusciante! Much love
Frusciante el mejor por lejos otra calidad el grupo !!🇦🇷

What??!! Keanu reeves on the guitar? Lol
хуйня, но радостно снова видеть мистера джона фрушанте
Vamooo los peppers!!!!!!
Viva godsciante!
Really dig Anthony's use of consonants in this - some odd choices that leave a cool feeling. great hook, and that guitar has been sooooo missed. Frigging delicious!
Omg this is why I LOVE these guys!!! I love it!!!!
Sheeew
Can't wait for April Fools Day!!!
ГРЯЗНЫЕ САТАНИСТЫ! СМОТРЕТЬ ПРОТИВНО И СЛУШАТЬ! РОЛИК-ОТМЕНЯЮ.     ☝️👩‍🦳👁🌌👁-ВЕРА!
only og's know what guitar john is using and why
So many years have passed since Frusciante was the guitarist. A lot of emotions come to mind while listening to this song. It’s like a song that I’ve heard for the last 20 years. I don’t think people realized it when we were young and listening to, “Californication,” “scar tissue,” “under the bridge,” but John Frusciante is my generation’s Jimi Hendrix, his solos are timeless, tasty and soulful. The world needed you, Frusciante, welcome back- great one.
Absolutely beautiful
gracias jhon frusciente eres un genio. RED HOT JUNTO POR FIN
du carai
Amazing!

Well this happened today
⭐️ I’m so lucky that my favorite band is still making music. Your songs have been the soundtrack of my life ♥️ I’m so excited for the new album! Excited to hear Frusciante with them once again!
John Frusciante Mania Mantab
HES BACK
Siiii! Al fin! Y este año el montón de conciertos! Bien por el 2022…!
Why won’t they just stay gone?! Jesus flea looks like he’s been smoking meth under an overpass. Their music is boring, repetitive and pointless. Generic, cookie cutter band. Using the same formula they had in the 90s. Please just stay gone.
Me encanta! Despues de tantos años es increíble escuchar algo nuevo y que sea tan bueno!
Belíssima música e John Frusciante... ❤️
This is amazing!!
Joyaaaaa!!!!!
Sambel pedes..is back 😁😁
Me encanta el clip y esa vibra de reunión de amigos parecida a Desecration Smile, con la onda de viaje onírico de Breaking the Girl y esa fotografía que apareció desde The Getaway
How I miss that guitar/base tone & of the 2 legends!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Los extrañaba muchísimo, los amo❤️❤️❤️❤️
Сойдёт для сельской местности 🤔☝️😁
#BlackSummer
Boring.
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE Slowed versiyonu mutlaka dinleyin

Wow! Awesome!🔥
#BlackSummer
#BlackSummer
Man, see John back in 2022 in a video clip breaking our hearts with those old school riffs, transporting us to the pass. Lot of people dreams coming true. The legends never stopped.
Strong Californication + By The Way vibes. YES.
I may not born on their era, but I love their music. ❤️🎶
#BlackSummer
The part from 3:08 gives me especially old RHCP vibes... love it
#BlackSummer
鳥肌立った
Beautiful guitar solo!!! Frusciante is back!!! Full hearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️
#BlackSummer
John is back, mtfckrs!
Will Ferrell never been so great with the drum!!
Welcome back John ! <3
Como é bom ver o John de volta com a banda. O clipe traz uma sensação dos anos 90 da MTv. Sucesso!
Meu Deus, que felicida... Que melodia maravilhosa.
Finally
Los RHCP siendo los RHCP! Gracias por eso amigos!
Love the Chili Peppers, probably the best band in the world but I sure dont like how they F'ed Josh Klingenhoffer.
Ja é hit papai
This sounds exactly like... the chili peppers circa 2002:) Doesn't have the novelty factor that josh brought to the band, but hey, I'll take the shot of nostalgia. Surreal to see a new release from the "classic" peppers!
This is all what I needed. Thank you and much love from Argentina!
Un bonheur de les voir réunis 🥰🥰🥰🥰
lo escuche como 50 veces ya.. estoy loopeando el tema... me estan fornicando auditivamente... Frusciante, Chad,, Flea.. Tony.. gracias Universo por unirlos y yo compartir esta linea de tiempo junto a los RHCP
Meh...
Sooo good! I didn't know Keanu Reeves did join to the band as a new guitarist! 😂2022 good for music! Keep them coming!
Я люблю вас, перчики!
te amo frusciante
Anthony is JACKED
Holeee craaap! Back to form with a new instant classic. How are they SO good?
Grateful to hear John play guitar again, if nothing else. Rhcp Orlando 2022 can’t wait!
Is it reality or im just dreaming.. Thank you RHCP!!!!!!
La banda cuyo sonido e integrantes no denotan el paso del tiempo. INCREÍBLE!
chad and flea are on fire
Spettacolare, da brividi
It's okay.
🔥🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Ameiiiii🇧🇷🇧🇷
🤟🤟🤟
Foi a gente que pediu, siiiiimmm! ❤️‍🔥
Porra, quando os cara tão arrebentando o rock in rio não trás... Porra, feliz demais
thanks RHCP!
♥️🤟🏽
Frusciane voltou aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa porraaaaaaaa obrigado 2022
The best 2022 RHCP🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤩
The song was ok IMO. Idk why I never really liked RHCP. They never struck a chord for me that made me say WOW!   Yet, I appreciate the music they make and what they’ve done for the music industry yet I just never found them to be super mind blowing. Maybe one day that will change, but as for now, eh.
AMO VOCÊS  💖💖💗💓💞
John's playing is the best part of the track
Que lindos 😭 amo tanto!
JOHN AHHHHH
Amo D+ essa banda
Is he doing some weird Irish accent?
The good old days
A work of art 🙌🤘
A banda do meu coração , sem dúvidas alguma ... Tenho quinze anos e nasci ouvindo Chili Peppers orgulho de dizer que é a minha banda favorita !
As músicas do red hot... Continuam lesas como sempre..🙄
3:54 min of pure get away from it all. Thank you for the break
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
Nunca fui triste
"China's on the Darkside of the moon" - Covid related?🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ого 😲😃😃 давно перцев не видела
AAAAAAAAAAA
Wow!!
El solo de Frusciante es enérgicamente melancolía y misterio me encantaaa
Been waiting for this stadium arcadium vibe for a while. John is *chefs kiss*. Cannot wait to see you guys in August!!!!
Amo amo amo
Jhonn que bueno otra ves juntos 🥺🥺🥺
That guitar, that damned guitar 😍. John is 🔙
❤️❤️❤️
Legendsss
God where did Anthony find the fountain of youth? I need to know!!! He looked  the same for 25 years now .crazy
Блэйдь) Я постарел вместе с перцами)
But guys it’s winter
For being almost 60, Kiedis is in insane shape
So much chorus pedal on the guitar. Can't tell if I like it
Obrigado por isso RHCP !!!
THE KING IS BACK!!!!!
Aí meu Deus! O coração tá como???? ❤️❤️❤️
Foda pra caralho!
hence proved music is alive
Maravilhosos <3
Старички ещё попылят
JOHN ANTHONY MOTHERFUCKIN' FRUSCIANTE!!  ♥♥♥
suddenly it's the year 2000 again!
Nostalgic :") Is good to see you again in the round, guys!
When the EFF did Danny Trejo join RHCP?!!?!
Anthony sounds like he is doing a Gordon Lightfoot impression on those verses.
🔥🔥
Czas nikogo nie oszczędza  . Time spares No one
Flea is doing a Gaucho cosplay
#standwithukraine
Legend is back
Red Hot está vivo, meu povo! 🤘🏼
Oh, yeah, baby!! They are back again!! I have goosebumps. This song rebember me Stadium Arcadium.
i don't have words for describing this feeling. Unique and Indescribable. I eagerly awaited his return. You never disappoint me. You have inspired me, and I always feel accompanied by your music. Songs that always touch my soul. I love you guys and your music. RHCP is perfection!!!!!so fucking yeah!!! See you in June!!!🏄‍♀
Anthony Kiedis pegou umas aulas de dança com o Z Maguinho, certeza!
So glad you're back in action!! Really hope to see you in Chile soon!  👊
John 😭😭😭😭😭
Best day of 2022!! Thank you🙏
QUEM TA TRISTE NAO TA MAIS

frusciante tem uma essência única, grande volta dos caras !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, FODA DEMAIS! QUE PRAZER VER TODOS JUNTOS :') RHCP É VIDA \M/
É como voltar no tempo. Esses quatro não podem se separar nunca. Clipe e música sensacional. Mal posso esperar as demais 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌👏👏👏
Aguante JF
Le regreso el alma a los peppers
NIce Mullet AK
Depois de 12 anos lendo comentários no yt pedindo a volta do homem, ver ele num clipe do rhcp dnv nao tem explicação, foda demais!!!
Fan desde que tengo uso de la memoria de los peppers, que alegría que vuelva John, la música está de fiesta
de las pocas bandas q viven y siguen lansando buena música.  no como la mierda de colaboración q se hizo un día
если убрать кого-то одного из этой четверки, это уже не РХЧП! но для меня лично без Джона-это уже 50% группы. Меня реально колотило,когда я узнала что он вернулся!они все реальные молодцы! и их песни просто Божественны! абсолютно все!
amo vocês, a guitarra do john. S2
Tá no shape hein pae
Anyone gonna see these guys in Toronto in August????!!!!
I don’t know why, but for me the best album of RHCP is Stadium Arcedium.
With John!!!! 🎸😎😍
When John's guitar kicks in around :47, it's really special
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great to see the original gang back together! Can't wait for the new album.
Frusciante lives
The red hot chili pepper saved my life. If it wasn’t for your music I prolly wouldn’t be here today and I’m thankful for you guys and your music plz keep making more.
john... oldandnew  mixing  love it all  with
Perfección! 😎🎸🎸🎸  ♥
Love rhcp✌💪🇧🇷
this is amazing! thanks guys for decades of beautiful music!
Eu amo essa banda !!!!
Viagra for my soul
Grande música e o Anthony está bem bombado!!!
やっぱスゲー‼️の一言。
Красавы!)
I've been waiting.... I've been waiting...  since 2009.  Johnny's back!!!
Excelenteeeeeeeeeeeeeeee muy buena cancion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! excelente arrerglos eh interpretacion que nunca mueran las bandas!!!!!!
It’s as if Frusciante never left! I love hearing his sound back in a RHCP song!!!! It also makes me so happy seeing these four in a video again 😭😭
Отлично! 👍
esperando la nueva pelea entre los dos jejejeje
Eu sou o comentário em PT-BR que você procura. 🇧🇷😎✌️
Nice to have John back, but when did Keanu Reeves join the band?
Increíble como cambia una banda con un guitarrista , FRUSCIANGOD
A new Chili Peppers song is a nice surprise to wake up to.
Круть!!!! Ждём альбом!
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! Thanks for this offering!!! Can’t wait to hear it all!!!!
Welcome back Johhhhncito!!!!
For all you naysayers here these guys were in hs during the 1970s. Think about that! Their average ages are around 57. The point is they have matured and unsurprisingly mellowed in their personna and their music as shown in this song. You cant compare this song to 'Give it away,' they created in their 20s.
Why does Anthony look like a dollar store version of joe exotic?
QUE SON ESTAS LAGRIMAS QUE CAEN , DIOSSSSS SON UNOS GENIOS
Come to Brasil, pleeeeease 🥺🖤
Nothing more than love for this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
RCHP's identity is John Frusciante as a guitarist, great to have you back and hear your talent.
If Under the bridge is a tribute to LA, this one is desperately longing for California free of annual forest fires. 😢
Te quiero mucho Red Hot Chili Peppers  <3 :'(
Nice to see Will Ferrel on drums still.
Esto va a ser un classico de la banda!!
It's ok, but I won't lie I was expecting something more powerful.
Genial verlos 🤩 nuevamente
Another Certified Classic!
Inspiring me since ‘87. 🤪
oh oh oh oh oh ooooo 🌶
Sounds very Stadium Arcadia still. Anthony sings like an Irish limerick.
Song is so stale , boring and monotonous. in football sometimes is time to " hang the boots" well, in music too.  Way too repetitive .... Dogshit song
Waiting for linkin park comeback💥💥
Coisa linda esse solo
Os caras nunca erram, o Brasil te ama Red Hot😍😍
I'VE BEEN WAITING, I'VE BEEN WAITING!!!! RHCP are gonna hit seriously this year!!!
Love the instrumental on this track! Not a huge fan of the vocals and autotune though, but i'm sure ill warm up to it eventually.
What a guitar solo....
Frusciante
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🙌🏽🙌🏽🌶️🙌🏽🙌🏽🇧🇷🇧🇷🙌🏽
Fruchainte and his riffs are back i think the world is already healing

Man its so good to have john back, the golden chili peppers line up is back! Due to age i imagine we dont have alot of albums left before they sail off into the sunset, so im glad they are back in their best form!
Can't wait for the album to come out. Paying full price
👏🏻🌶🔥❤
Welcome back John fucking frusciante !! 🤯

O bom e velho RHCP está de volta 🖤🖤
Is that John Wick??? Amazing seeing the best lineup ever. Abrazo Mexicano!!!! 🤘🏻🇲🇽🤘🏻🇲🇽🤘🏻🇲🇽🤘🏻
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AMAAAAZING!!! ALL THE LOVE FROM BRAZIL 🇧🇷
Great song .That chorus hits you like a Tyson left hook
Hearing this gets the emotions flowing. I was fresh out of high school and neck deep in music when Stadium Arcadium dropped. We were all blown away by how fresh it was and how incredible Frusciante was. Even with the length of that album, we played it on repeat all day, just mesmerized with every song. The chemistry was amazing. One of the best moments of my life. 16 years later, now with a 12 year old stepson who's new to guitar and just as into their music (Especially Frusciante), I feel the nostalgia of 2006 and the excitement of hearing new music from them. Can't wait to hear what else they've created. I expect more days of playing their album on repeat.   Rock on, boys! Glad to see you back together again. It's been too long.
Only I am tired with Frusciante? Coming back once the money runs low, leaves and a new guitarist comes and get's kicked in the arse whenever his mood changes and wants to come back.
Arrepiou a volta com tudo da banda com John Frusciante
ohh greeaatttt !! ..
TREMENDA OBRA MAESTRA  20/10 Y G O D
🔥AMAZING🔥
They still got it 🖤🖤🖤🖤
WhooooooooooaaaaoaooaoaoaoaooaoaoaoaaaaaaaYEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have been listening to Red Hot Chilli Peppers since I was 14 and I don't know why this just didn't give me the chills I get when I listen to their other creations like 'warped'. I do miss Dave Navarro despite the chaos. This feels like something 'Avenged Sevenfold would put out.
What's the deal with the accent?  It's a little unexpected to hear a Scottish/Australian accent all of a sudden coming from Anthony Kiedis.
Não erram uma.
So nice they still working on new stuff.
Will Ferrell playing drums again. I'm so happy!
Just perfect!!!!!
🤩
I love you guys!!!
The " Aaaaaa"  sound backup vocal from John is the sound that we missed from RHCP. Welcome back John! We missed this RHCP sound so much!!
thailand fanclub 🇹🇭
THANK YOU!
Do caralh* os caras voltaram trazendo o melhor da nostalgia e essência do Red Hot Chili Peppers
It's so good to have this sound back! RHCP is back! This song reminds Stadium Arcadium
New John back vocals and riffs are all I need omggggg thank youuuu 😭
Good to see you back, John!
i love frusciante but with a couple of listens this sounds dull, sorry
Eu e meu pai amamos as suas músicas 😍
"Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Not too sure about the song itself, not bad, but not blowing me away. That said, John is AWESOME and throws some serious and heavy heart into this piece. Glad to see the boys putting it out there and looking forward to the rest of the album.
❤️
aeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tks tks <3
The auto tune tho
This is so funny to listen too, you can hear the combination of modern recording gear but still their signature rawish RHCP sound.
Rhcp all 2022 ! New album tings
Its chili pepper hot!!!!!!
Amazing Mr John Frusciante 🤘
This is a solid track!Together again and  sounding as great as ever.  I have nothing but respect for Josh, but it's so great to hear and see John back in the band! 🤘🤘
哀愁ただよう
John Frusciante looks so fucking good! He looks better than Cali, BTW, and SA John Frusciante!!
josh frusciante is one of the best guitarists of all time.
Bien ahí el Kun Agüero ahora se dedica a cantar
Long live Red Hot!
Que porrada!!!, enfim o quarteto fantástico está de volta, confesso que as lágrimas rolaram aqui ao ouvir Frusciante novamente na minha banda favorita. Vida londa ao rhcp.
Long life to Red Hot!! I'm a great brazilian fan, grew up listening to your music and today I have a cover band of you, playing with my friends!  Vida longa ao Red Hot!! Sou um grande fã brasileiro, cresci ouvindo suas músicas e hoje tenho uma banda cover de vocês, tocando com meus amigos!
I've been waiting ♥️🔥
Que buena vueltaaaa de los Red Hot !!!!! , Ya quiero escuchar los otros temas !!!
У.Г.

Энтони прямо кайфует от своей охуенной формы.

Me enamore nuevamente de RHCP.!!!! SU MAGIA INTACTA!!! ❤️🇦🇷
I'm literally having goosebumps seeing John with them again... The king is back!
Will Ferrell look great ;)
lmao John Frusciante looks like Keanu Reeves now
I hope there isn’t this much autotune on the whole album
Whats up with the Irish accent?
Ahhhh, so glad John is back.
Regresaron a lo clásico, bien!
Tiger King up in this mahfu

Wet sand vibes
The classic RHCP sound yeah
El ultimo video de Diego Verdaguer
I BELIVE IN FRUSCIANTE SUPREMACY!!
Why is there no concert in Poland ??
Tiger King?
It's very cool!
RHCP quality certification. Brazil loves you!
I honestly have mixed feelings about this song. There are definitely moments of brilliance, which gets me excited for the rest of the album. At the same time, I hope this isn't the best the album has to offer.
tashe
Absolut perfekt day, thanks so much for soul in Notes and Music, so long they go with my life,   all become older,  and wiser and better, thanks
Am I the the only person who doesn't like this?
JOHHHHHHHHN!!!!!!  Also the kick tone is best I'v ever heard on an RHCP record!
It's like By The Way, with a little of One Hot Minute, but with the solos of Stadium Arcadium, amazing
😈
😍😍😍 me encantó el regreso de Frusciante! 💪💪💪 Todos unos cracks!!
Es simplemente hermoso ❤️ escuchar casa nota y cada letra trae un sentimiento de nostalgia increíble...
Los amooooo!!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
MARAVILHOSO, John é muita foda <3
E assim, os olhos começam a "suar"!! que banda é essa meus amigos!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
El mejor momento para estar vivo y poder ver el regreso de frusciante a los peppers, ame está single 🖤🌶️ ROCK OUT MOTHERFUCKERS!!
La forma en la que necesitaba que esto pasara, FAAAAk!!!!!!!!!
Magnifique
♥♥♥♥
Mixed feelings. I was kind of digging the verse and thinking this might be a classic, but the chorus that kicked in is just plain boring. Feels like a missed chance.
Get it Will Ferrell!
We love you John, welcome back, we all missed you!
🥱😴last 30 years.
HE’S BACK
Amazing song
Omg
Vamooooooooooos me hicieron volver a la vida los amo!
Vida longa ao RHCP 🇧🇷!
E' un giorno che ascolto questa canzone e sto veramente impazzendooooo <3 è stupenda!!!!
Missed Frusciante so much. This was perfect! ❤
And I just got this little feeling, and it’s telling me this ain’t the last album either..
Tão bom voltar a ver John e Flea juntos cara. Que momento ❤🇧🇷 #RHCP
After years and still real musicians!
🤘😎
Thanks Red Hot Chili Peppers <3
Super Song, super Video! Respekt!
te quiero mucho Diego Verdaguer
Cool, some new shit, thanks guys.
It’s official. They write nothin but bangers.
What’s the name of this band
Obrigado ❤️🇧🇷
VAMOS CTMMMMM AGUANTES LOS CHILI PEPPERSSSSSSS WOOOOO
Os amo. Pero este es uno de vuestros peores singles con diferencia. Vaya bajona.
To me, this is like a comeback after Staduim Arcadium. It's like the band had the hiato going until now, and all the stuff released with Klinghoffer was another band.  This has clear signs of the real RHCP.  It's something new,. It has new influences. Yet, it's Red Hot Chilli Peppers at it's core.
And this is why the red hot chilli peppers are one of the greatest bands ever and why Jonny boy is the best fucking guitarist ever
perfect!
Queremos a los Chili Peppers, Queremos a los Chili Peppers, Queremos a los Chili Peppers!
😍
My favorite guitarist is back!
Hell yeah, AND a guitar solo!
❤️‍🔥🥺
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Two words i wish to say: JOHN FRUSCIANTE
♥
se viene un 2022 super bueno
Até arrepia
Welp time to learn this on guitar😂
Damn they got old
Tears fall! After so much waiting listen to this gem and how that guitar sounds ♥️ This is epic! John is back!
Estoy presente en el estrenoooo pa q me recuerde cuando se lanzo esta musica :)
OMG, they still have the same energy. I loved this new song.
Ótima musica, com toda  certeza já vai ser um novo hit
A FELICIDADE VOLTOU
I wanna know Anthony’s workout routine
Sadly,if you told me Weird Al was doing vocals on this,I wouldn't even try to argue.
story telling vibes, i love it!
The autotune is strong with this one
Cara que louco velho, a alma do red hot chili Peppers nunca muda, ver o frusciante tocando do jeito dele e o flea todo mundo junto de novo é surreal velho depois de tantas coisas difíceis, não é fácil permanecer nessa mesma energia, eu só posso agradecer
No voy a decir que no estoy contento de ver esto, pero no es lo que esperaba.
And fuck yeah. Wow
A sonoridade do John é inconfundível e inimitável, grande momento para se estar vivo....
hard to be a girl, so nice to be a boy..
2022 is gunna be ok
ずっと待ってたよ、最高さ。
OMG OMG OMG OMG A DREAM COMING TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Does AK hair qualify as a mullet?
Да это не хит, но это те самые rhcp. Гениальность Джона никyда не денется и если это возвращение не ради галочки, то хиты мы еще полyчим
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA EU AMO TANTO QUE MORROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It takes a Fru to make them sound like the Red Hots again. Loved Josh, but man, this sounds like home
i cannot wait to see you guys in august with the strokes!!
Espectacular regreso de los Red Hot, se extrañaba al master de Frusciante!
Fucking LOVE this!
CAN’T BELIEVE FRUSCIANTE IS BAAACCCKKKK 😭😭

gracias vida por dejarme presenciar esto y volver a sentir lo que sentí la primera vez que los  escuche juntos
These OG are back!! Fuckin love them ❤️
🌶️RHCP.🌶️  forever🔥🔥🔥
Szacun szacun nie sądziłem że jeszcze ich tak usłyszę przez chwilę czułem że jeżdżę na gitarze po błękitnej wodzie kozak totalny <3
печально все это..... вот так начать "динамикой "- Suck My Kiss   и продолжить этим.....................
Top!
Aguante red hot 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Me eriza la piel escucharlos!! Emocionada por verlos en vivo
Eu estava tão empolgada para ver a volta do Frusciante.  Estou feliz demais.  Ansiosa para ouvir o álbum completo.
This is John Frusciante.
Tengo 33 años. Y siempre pensaré que RHCPP serán siempre la banda que al escucharla me remonte a mis mejores años de vida. Tantos recuerdos de ese tiempo. Por eso serán siempre los mejores!
Frusciante doesn’t age I guess
Anthony looks like he just came from the set of a porno starring himself and everyone was like “well we got the cameras here anyways, why not shoot a music video”
The Chilli Peppers are one with Frusciante 👌
As lack luster as the song is, I'm thinking the album is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥 and this is just a teaser. They didn't bring frusciante back for nothing.💯
What is “china’s on the dark side of the moon” 0:35  supposed to mean lol
Awesome
a mexican poncho?
alegria a mi dia
La rolita me hizo llorar, verlos juntos de nuevo es lo que he esperado durante mucho tiempo, larga vida RHCP
I love this Band . It's a Fact. So glad for seen they are back . John Frusciante is 25% of magic that can't be missed. Hooray to the Red Hot Chili Peppers !!!
I've been listening to your music since I was 8 years old!!🤘🏻❤ (18 now haha)
Who else couldn’t help but smile when Frusciante’s solo kicked in? Love him so much. ❤️
I'll miss Josh, but John is just SO AMAZING
Well, I hate it less than I hate Kiedis' hair.
i'm crying like a little girl! I never thought that I would see them together again
They keep conquering and amazing us with this unique style.
Amazing!
❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
Definitivamente ahora es que les queda calidad en sus trabajos. Excelente👍
Great tune! A bit frustrated on the guitar solo as John only repeats the melody… but eh, cool stuff as always!
Still cannot stomach the way they discarded Josh. Dude gave his all for a decade. The gall to call it unlimited love, fuck em.
Que lindo ❤ esperei muito por isso
Goosebumps.
Alucinante 🌶️🌶️🌶️🤘🏻🤘🏻🎶🎧😎
Frusciante !!! So nice to see them together again.
Nice to be part of the first 700k views out of hundreds of millions this video will get. What a return from John!
Why does it sound like he is singing with an Irish accent?
Спасибо из России!!!
am I old?
John e o coração dessa banda não tenhe jeito.
what a great song
世界最強のレッチリが返ってきた😭
🌏☮️🎼👏🏻😌🤗
Dancinhas do AK ✅ John com seus solos gostosos ✅ Flea sendo Flea ✅ Chad vestido de mecânico ✅  ELES VOLTARAM! 🌶❤‍🔥 A Pandemia vai acabar e o mundo voltará ao normal!
ไม่ว่าจะผ่านไปสักกี่ปีผวกคุณก็ยังจะอยู่ในใจผวกเราเหมือนเดิม และตลอดไป❤
Hermoso solo 👌
Não há nada melhor no rock, que ouvir a guitarra do Frusciante conversando com o Baixo do Flea! 😍
Frusciante is back !!!! 🔥🔥🖤
John is really the important part who can make RHCP sounds complete. I like his guitar line because it sounds like many old RHCP songs that I like and also feels modern at the same time.
Anthony's stylist drives a rusted, dark tinted van?..
これが聞きたかった！フルシャンテ最高！
Cara eu gosto muito do Red Hot Chili Peppers quando eles Valoriza as linhas de funk rock
amazingggg🥰
A mullet and a tash ???
I totally love this song.
Those Stadium Arcadium vibes feel so right 🤤
Perfeeeeeiiitoooooo
John Frusciante voltou com tudo
Verry love จอห์น ฟรัสซิแอนเต กลับเข้ามาเสียที ที่รอคอย ต้นกำเนิดมือกีตาร์  ถึงจะเป็น Red Hot Chili Peppers อเมริกันฟังก์ร็อคระดับตำนาน👍🎸  new album UNLIMITED LOVE.
John Frusciante ❤
Mis ojos los volvieron a ver juntos. Que gozó.
"Старые" добрые перцы. Мурашки по всему телу от их стиля.... Браво!
Es excelente, que magnífica combinación, mantienen intacto el estilo  de la banda,
Soo glad, leaping to the sky! Woooo
woooooowwwwww
A MELHOR BANDA DE ROCK <3
AHHHHHHHHHHHH GRITANDO FUERTE AHHHHHH
Os pais tão on 🤘🏻
Chad Flea Anthony John You belong together until the end and beyond 🥺🥰
solid until now...rhcp💪🙏👏❤
🥲🥲❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ i love urrrrrrrrrrrr
É pra vim fazer turnê aqui no BRASIL.
Genius John frusciante
Es tan surreal verlos juntos de nuevo. Se me erizó toda la piel cuando apareció Frusciante.
Anthony looks like Jim Croce. Or a 70s porn star.   And just like that, the Chilli Pepper's have another forgettable song.
It's a bit tame isn't it? I have the idea it is mixed to get the vocals to the front, which gets the guitaring too muffled.
🤩👍
Es el rhcp de toda la vida escucharlos me hace recordar los 90 con sus primeros álbumes gracias frusciante por limar asperezas . ✌️
Soy feliz soy feliz soy feliz!!!! regresaron y que mejor con el rey Frusciante!!!! los amooooo
Flea bass lines is back again !!!
This is beautiful
Legendary musicians, artists, band!!! ROCK on RHCP !!!
muito bom, agora cadê o novo álbum ?
The kings are back, and they haven’t missed a beat. The synergy and energy you can’t deny. It’s like the Beatles got back together in our life time
Love it, even if it sounds like an "under the bridge" updated.
John wicked is a guitarist
The chorus sounds a lot like Slow Cheetah from Stadium Arcadium.
Thats my frusciante❤️❤️
Much love from Argentina
Omg I'm alive again. Thanks guys, love you so much that I cant explain.❤😢
Johns back, great feel !!! 😎👌
Frusciat's riff! Fantastic
Yes! Keeping guitar solos alive in rock music! Frusciante was a huge influence on my guitar playing.
correndo pra tirar esse riff de john na guitarra e passar  o dia todo tocando
Qué lindo volver a disfrutarlos juntos! Cuanta magia 🌶❤️‍🔥 y seguramente se venga un discazo! Long live the Chili Peppers ❤️‍🔥🫀
Isso é muito Red Hot. Isso é muito John Frusciante. *) Its so Red Hot. Its so John Frusciante *) . Que NOSTALGIA !!! *)
16 yrs waiting this moment
Is that a brogue? 🤣🤣 Slow Cheetah in Gaelic
Feel like scar tissue
John looks like Jesus in this video and I love it
Anthony Kiedis' barber must be the same one cutting Joe Exotic's hair (a.k.a. Tiger King)   Looking forward to seeing them live soon!
Podem passar várias decadas, eles nunca vam perder a essência! Que banda sensacional, avante Peppers!!!
Waiting.... I been waiting for Frusciante to re join the band.
Чуть добавить гитару?  Джон:
Mantap
เล่น3ชิ้นพอ
❤️❤️❤️
🇧🇷
7/10 Rotary, 7/10 Phaser, 10/10 Solo, 10/10 Frusciante, 8/10 RHCP, 10/10 Mustaches, 6.5/10 Song, 5/10 In the shadows - The Rasmus
Frusciante should not have returned for this.
Made my day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely love it.. Cannot wait for the whole album
O timbre da guitarra já entrega, mas quando entra a bateria do Chad com essa caixa aguda, nossa... me lembrei do som clássico do RHCP :') Que bom vê-los todos juntos! E a música tá perfeita.
Los amo🌶! Saludos desde chile!😍
Freaking beautiful.  I love it.  Long live Frusciante, and the greatest lineup of the greatest band.
Nice to see Will Ferrell back on the drums
かっこいい！
We´re looking forward to hear the full album!
Very good
PQP EU AMO VOCESSSSSSSSSSS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
This isn't very good
BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!
Me siento tan emocionado de volver a escucharlos!!  La perfección Se nota cuando estan juntos!! Gracias por volver  Gran Maestro John Frusciante!! 🙌 tus melodias me hacen tam bien 😌 No importa si te gusta o no el tema, tenemos que estar agradecidos de volver a verlos juntos de nuevo, larga vida RHCP Larga Vida John!! 😀👍
Frusciante is back and Anthony has a different high tone than I've heard before with an Australian Hair cut. 💜🤘❤
Isso aqui é como se os Beatles tivessem se reunido, rapaziada. Eu tô emocionado ♥️
Pas un vrai foutu album depuis one hot minutes...    Trop pop trop radio trop rayon charcuterie..
Breaking all !!!! Foda
RHCP é a melhor banda do mundo!
Que som fantástico!!!!
Achei o clipe bem fraco, achei que viria algo parecido a Dark necesseties, q é recente, porém criativo na minha opiniao
cuanto esperamos esto, es lo mejor que ha traído el ´22
What's up with Anthony's verse vocal? Real weird.
That solo was awesome, love it.
Frusciante is an unbelieveble guitarrist, I can't even believe we passed such a long time without him on the media and on live shows
Amazing ⚡
Comparing John Frusciante to Jesus is just wrong. I mean the guys great and all, yeah, but he’s definitely no John Frusciante
¡Qué bueno es seguir con vida y verlos juntos de nuevo! 🖤🖤🖤
The voice doesn't aged. The same nostalgia deym...
So glad John is back,he makes chilli peppers songs so much better!!!
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK
They are 60, aren’t they? Age doesn’t even matter
not a huge fan but i like the references in the video to californication
IM LITERALLY CRYING
VASCO
Bad.

I love Red hot
Welcome back, Johnny!! It's really been a long time.
We have been waiting too RHCP.
Escucharé RHCP mis hijos los escucharán y mis nietos, mantener  esa escencia tan intacta es casi imposible ahora, gracias chilli peppers!!!
I know they get a lot of hate but this is much better than I thought it would be
Porrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
💯💯💯💯💯💯👍🏿
Frusciante it's back 😬🤟
Wow. Instant classic, that's crazy 👏👏👏
Why is Kiedis singing like Borat?
John Frusciante great guitar
VAMOS LOS PEPPERS!!!!!
2022, the year when a rock band invented time travel 🤘🤘
Thank you!😭❤❤❤❤
Californication meets Under the bridge.
Uhul 🤘🏼🇧🇷
Old скулллы свело
Ağlıyorum şuan John Frusciante iyi ki geldin.
HAGANME UN HIJOOOOO POR FAVOR!
went through a lot of saddnes this 2021 but finally Nice to hear RHCP in 2022 |,,/
O coroa ta forte hein, muito foda a música nova!!
🤔
They are back like in 1999 amazing!!
Great to see John back in the track. Great way to start the cold ass day here.
<3
VCS SAO  FODAS CARALHOOOOOOO
YESS
ta velhinho em
Parece um sonho, mano 🤙🏼 pedi tanto pra acontecer
John Frusciante robándose el protagonismo, simplemente un grande
I’m convinced every song of theirs has the same drum track
Los amoooo, increíble que no pierdan su escencia.
¡Qué mágica atmósfera se respira al escucharlos de nuevo! La esencia, el espíritu, el gusto y la calidad de siempre. Es como un viaje al pasado. Gracias por tanto RHCP ✨
Amazing ❤✌🌞👍❤
THE MOTHER FUCKER FRUSCIANTE IS BACK!
Sounds like a typical RHCP song.
❤️
Una belleza. Llore de principio a fin! La alegria q me da volver a las raices !!! Amo amo amo. Me hacen feliz!!!!!
I didn't know John wick played for RHCP
CANNOT WAIT to see them for the first time on tour this summer!!
Anthony drops some hard R’s
hermoso
It’s rare when an older band puts out music worth listening to.
This is real?
yes
que som meus amigos que som, melhor formação de todas. A vibe é de longe vista
This song sounds like it came from millionaire middle aged guys trying to tap into whatever made them artistic 30 years ago.
Never stops creating amazing songs.
This is what RHCP sounds like and how supposed to be.
Get rid of that awfull autotune…  It makes it almost unlistenable
Even though Kiedis is trying to sound like a pirate in the verses, it is so good to hear them put out new music. And now John is back everything is whole again
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ BEST
I was hoping to be impressed.  But it sounds just like their other stuff.  I think they've written this song 20 times already.  And it's been on the radio 10 of those times.  Playing it safe, i guess.
I'm crying
Mi himno
That 1 tinie tiny piece of note (2:21) in the solo that is quite off-key though it glide so smooth and so perfect in the song.. It has its own beauty and so unique. Damn it, John! Why are you so good?!
Still 90's as Fuk
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
WOW
Love that riff!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fucken love it can’t wait for the album they just keep getting better and better
Why is Anthony singing like a wise Sam Gange from Lord of the Rings?
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The video is pure crap but who cares... 🥰
cada 100.000 temas de mierda que salen en el mundo, salen cosas como estas, asi y todo vale la pena esperar, gracias John por volver, gracias Josh por mantener Gracias!
Can’t wait to see you in Seville 😎😎
Those guys are an infinite well of creativity
Grande john!
I kept feeling like he was gonna break off some new info on the Edmund Fitzgerald
it’s good to see frusciante again!
Obrigado John Frusciante.
Real music
Can't Stop for this blood in sugar while having  midnight sex with magick under the bridge road tripppin purple stained scar tissue on otherside & By the way its called give it away CALIFORNICATION.
The RHCP with Frusciante is about the only thing that can bring world peace judging by all the languages in the comments! Can't believe its been 16 years :)
Gracias Frusciante  y gracias Flea. Expectante al resto del álbum. Gracias por vuestra música.
What a weird look he’s got going for.  Waiting for black summer??  Something doesn’t feel good about this.
So good to see Frusciante back with a guitar in his hands!!!!!🌶🎸🔥
I loved, is like a reunion after a long time! Welcome back my dear John!
LEGENDS
Oh my God.
:c como te echaba de menos frusciante :C
new song wooooooooooo
Stadium feels here. Welcome back John.
Grandes  RHCP 🌶️
Esa esencia, ese sonido que me hizo enamorarme de su música!! Reyes!!!
Perfect. It sounds, has a feel and vibes of Calibration album. Simplicity of only a guitar, bass, drums and Anthony's unique vocals. That's all they need. Beautiful.
Woww ❤️big fans from indonesia Wellcome back john
They're back and they are giving off "Stadium Arcadium", "By The Way" and "Californication" vibes combined and this makes me even more hype for their new album. I'm not crying, I just woke up.
Tão feliz por receber este presente, obrigado ⚡
👏🏻🥳👏🏻🥳👏🏻🥳
These guys used to be a rock band.
Yes!!! This has such original RHCP vibes and I absolutely love the video too!!!!
The Real RHCP 🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely love this!
😃👍
Guys you make my year better, thanks as always ❤️❤️❤️
Sounds kinda 60’s with the melody of the chorus and then busting into the guitar solo after.
Frusciante en su estado puro. Qué regalo más grande ❤️
finally!!!!!!!! thanks for so much music and thanks John for coming back 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
the hero's we needed
idk man, frusciante hits different..
Frusciante is back! That's it!
Just as great as they’ve always been ❤️
🤘🔥🔥🔥
cool riff
Esses caras são foda
this band knows how to make music they are an inspiration hugs from 🇲🇽 🎧 🎵🎶🎸🤟
Welcome Back RHCP!
The boys are back!!
Yo al ver a Frusciante: Estas tan hermoso como el día que te perdi
Tô chorando, que música topppppp!!!!!!
A música é muito boa, seja bem-vindo de volta John Frusciante 🎸🤘🤘🤘🌶
This song grows on you, rock on :-)
❤️❤️❤️🤘🏻 I Love you guys ....
Love the vibe
Will ferrell is great on drums
Una alegría inmensa ver a los 4 juntos otra vez! Los esperamos en Argentina maestros!🇦🇷👍🏻
melhor formação!
Always a treat to hear Will Ferrell on the drums!
For anyone wondering about the vocals, it was a bold and risky move. He is inspired by folk music, sea shanties in particular for this one.
Hey dr disrespect
Eu sou muito fã da banda mas achei esse solo do Frusciante ridículo. Gosto dele, só que nessa música tá difícil defender, fico tentando entender pq as pessoas estão glorificando tanto esse solo e riff. Acredito que seja apenas pela idolatria mesmo.
I see strange parallels to the new Strokes record (not musically)
Everything about this song is perfect. I have a lump in my throat, and in my trousers.
Need to learn that juicy guitar riff
Los amo con mí vida
You can feel the energy when John is with the band. It's beautiful.
Now I know I am not the only one just sitting here pressing replay.
Not enough mentions of California
It's amazing how they get to produce not just nice, but excellent music (maybe the best of our generation) after all these years! Astonishing
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️
JOHN FRUSICANTE
Jesus is back.
Yessss
Good to see John back on the guitar ♥️
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!  The Chili's haven't had a cohesive release since Blood ,Sugar, Sex Magic....This is so horrible and so many making it sound like a conquering achievement by a band that is still relevant in 2022. Try listening to anything pre 1995 and that is RHCP music, This is Garbage.! SAD. ! Anthony's mustache has got to go...that 1975 Porn actor look doesn't work.....nor does the music they are making now...
Frusciante un maestro
Que sonido Loco Que Energía!!, Esa guitarra suena cabrón!! 🤯🤯que rico volver a escucharlos, si Black Summer suena asi de rico no me imagino el album completo papá! 🔥💣💥
They're back! I'm not saying this because a new album is coming out. You know what I mean; they're really back!
I honestly have mixed feelings about the vocals in this song. The music has moments of brilliance, which gets me excited for the rest of the album.
Grande Diego Verdaguer.
Glad to have new RHCP content. Keep the good stuff coming fellas.
They look and sound really good!
Te amo caralhooooooiooooow eu amo muuuuuoto vcs puta que pariu vcs são Deuses pra mim
Name of the song isn't very racially sensitive.
Not bad at all, they took a lot of the old sound, back to stadium arcadium, with some elements of the last albums, but for me, the quality still doesn't reach that of the old singles, but it's comparable to many of other great "secondary" album tracks. I'm still waiting a new "Big One" from Stadium arcadium, and this Is a good starting point for me :)
1:52 welcome back John!
Simplesmente OBRIGADO Chilli Peppers!
kiedis' vocals are the same as on the album with klinghoffer
Simply amazing! Straight shooter rhythms, distinctive lyrics, amazing musicianship! For the past 25 years this band has set the tone for my life and I cannot wait to see you all live in August Miami!
Why is he singing like that
Que coisa maravilhosaaa
Sou apaixonadaa! 😍
This song screams "John is going to destroy this LIVE"....
Hasta ganas de llorar de la felicidad de escuchar esta joya me dieron 😍😍😍 larga vida al buen rock 😎
Asu mare.volvi a nacer☮🌻❤🤘
ok it's kind of just what i expected them to do but idgaf i love it
Unlimited Love incoming!!
Grande Diego Verdaguer
Ohhhh me vengo, después de tanto tiempo de espera para poder verlos reunidos 🥲

I can feel the love put into this track. Great job guys.
absolute banger
john frusciante é um Deus, nada se compara a mente  pensante desse cara, olha a difereça , foi so o cara voltar a banda voltou a ser o que era.
When we need you more, you deliver!!  :)
Not gna lie, hearing/seeing new John material got it a little dusty in here.
it's not rap? fantastic
Tremendo tema...ni hablar del video. RHCP continue delivering quality in both sides ...excellent song!.
Simplemente genial. un gusto volver a escuchar otro sencillo.
They've been around since the early 80s. And still on top.
simplesmente a melhor música do ano!!
estoy tan feliz!! sin duda Frusciante tiene esa esencia de los RHCP
Incrível, incrível !!❤️
SONZEIRA
Nunca fui triste🖤🖤
Is this the best RHCP guitar solo ever?
그래 이거지
Bas nya keren anjit
YESSS

Must admit I never was/have been a Chili Peppers fan. But hearing them takes me back to middle school days. And that I appreciate
EPICO, Gracias por ofrecernos todo su  " UNLIMITED LOVE"        🌀🌬✳🎶🍃😌😊
This is the rhcp I want to hear from long time, wow

🇧🇷🇧🇷 o impossível aconteceu, viva a RHCP 🤟
Eu estou vivo!!!!!! Não estou sonhando!!!!
What's with the fake accent
чёрное лето, белая осень, черная зима... заебали эти качели☝️
Their sound is great, their music is timelessness
Is he putting on an Irish accent ?
39 anos de muita musica de qualidade   🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is awesome..The red Hot Chili Pepers can do no wrong .Can' wait to see them September in Philadelphia
Me vuelve el alma al cuerpo!!! Emoción intacta como el primer que los escuche♥️ gracias por alegrarme el día y la vida, poder ver a Jhon de vuelta era algo que parecía medio complicado y de vuelta está 😊larga vida a Rhcp, esperando con ansias el álbum, gracias por tanto mis queridos chili peppers, hasta la muerte con ustedes ♥️ La calidad intacta como el primer día que los escuche

I shed a tear. Beautiful stuff.
1:55 WTF FLEA🤣🤣🤣
Os coroa ainda são fod4
Essa música me fez lembrar de uma namorada que tive e também ótimos momentos que tive ao lado dela que por sinal adorava os chili peppers e principalmente john frusciante  igual a mim obrigado por me emocionar tanto meus eternos ídolos e eterno John Frusciante VIDA LONGA AO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!
There was a time when Josh had to adapt to John's style of playing without being John himself. I now observe the opposite has happened, it's just an observation, I want to listen more from this production to test this. Anyways all good
🙏
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
So fucking good, like they're soooooo great together, still creating such great songs. Always been a fan
Sensacional,Red Hot é foda
Anthony, Flea, John, and Chad - YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST !!! Welcome back John Frusciante, you guitar is just bloody magic !

O homi ta de volta krl!!!
Rock live legends
오 레드핫의 신선한 리프를 들을수 있다니 ㅜㅜ
The older I am, the more I am for a few well thought tones rather than shredding. Obviously it is natural :) Anyway, JF can do anything with guitar and it will be just right. The whole band, song and sound is magnificent!
happy to see that John Frusciante is back.. RHCP sounds great again!!
Ainda bem que existe bandas como essa que marcam geraçoes e nunca deixa de fazer uma boa musica!!!

https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE Versiyon slowed
The boys are back babyyy!!!! Hearing John's guitar tone and his background vocals was everything I needed to start off my day. Got the vinyl pre-ordered and going to order concert tickets soon too! This iteration of the Peppers will forever be the best. John is the reason I picked up the guitar 17 years ago
Ameiiiiii, muitas saudades ❤❤❤
goosebumps since the first note of frusciante's chord HEEEL YAA
increibleee!
What a come back 🌶🌶❤🔥

Vocês nunca decepcionam? 😌❤
Muito bom, RHCP sempre detonam, e não mudam a essencia, igual a maioria das bandas do passado.

I love it!!! So awesome to hear John  “it’s been a long time” can’t wait for the full album drop ❤️🌶♾🎶😎

Muito obrigado por isso, Red Hot Chilli Peppers!
Que bom ver os 4 juntinhos de novo. Vida longa Peppers😍😍😍. Que momento meus amigos
I’m still looking forward to the album BIG TIME!! But the single……..it’s not instant, it’s not grabbing me by the collar and saying “get on this” like Chili Pepper songs usually do.

Os melhores voltaram!
Enamorada completamente de esta banda
OHHHHHHHH MY GASHH!! I MISS THEIR SIGNATURE GUITAR RIFFS, AND ANTHONY'S VOICE IS JUST!! AGGG!! MISS U GUYS <333
Que emoción 🥲🥲
Keep rockin' the universe! ❤️‍🔥💫🌎
Is this new song?
Nice!  Hope we also get some funk from the BSSM era.
song ganz ok , bloss flo der schurrbart sieht völlig scheisse uncool aus der störr und steht dir überhaupt nicht . also ab damit dann wird die mucke noch viel besser und wird nicht von diesem pornostreifen gebremmst . doch der sieht wirklich echt lächerlich aus so könnte ich mir nie im leben ein RHP konzert ansehen , du bist halt doch keine freddy mercury clownkoppie das hast du nicht nötig hier ein matra der seelenschau für dich ; salwendumhel glück auf see you aber hoffentlich ohne den schnäuzer des grauens , moin !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Só tenho uma palavra foda

Goosebumps
John's guitar can calm a soul...
WE'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
I couldn’t be any happier. Can wait to see you guys live.
Thank god for this . For rhcp. For making my life different in all the ways. ❤🌶
Lyrics:  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
puta ki pariuuuuuuuuuuuuu BRAZILLLL
que emoção do crrrll🙏🏼❤️❤️
Will Ferrell killing it on drums as before! Still cant get over the fact he's also a great musician!
Well, now I’m expecting something to happen for this summer. We know you celebs tell on what’s going on with your occult shit 😜
Amazing!!! 🤩😜🤘
Los mesías de la música padre

Back to 90s song..

Los amo chicos :'''']
Muito bom como sempre ❤️❤️
OS CARA SAO FODAAAAAAA

Soo glad you are back 😊💕👍
Lejos lo mejor que he escuchado. Frusciante una leyenda, Kiedins una voz incondicional RHCP 4Ever
You know it’s a good one if it makes you cry
El rey ha vuelto.
Me encanto !!!  Saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
Temazo! Por alguna razón me recuerda a Slow Cheetah
we all know theyre great...as always and have been...i just wanna see reggaeton, trap, billie eilish troops diggin to their records...thats bout it... and daaaayum this RHCP formation is older than my age, best one thou!!
pongamos este temón numero 1 en tendencias
LOS MEJORES!! no importa cuando leas esto.
Love It guys!! You are amazing 😍
Perfect comeback song - can't wait for the rest of the album.
After so many years, as always, kiedis and his allergic of shirt😂
China is on the dark side of the moon??
What the hell Anthony? Oh well. Great that they're back and with John, excellent!
Que banda perfeitaaaa!!!!
First impression: Hooky, pleasant, fine, safe, middle of the road. Not Earth-shattering, but none of their singles over the past two decades - Monarchy of Roses notwithstanding - have blown me away initially. Anthony’s affectated ‘Celtic accent’ in the verses is a bit cringey. Performances in general are excellent, as you’d expect.   If someone told me this was an unreleased track from Stadium Arcadium, I’d believe it. 🤷‍♂️
Orribile
Eh, liked klinghoffer's stuff more. Jimi hendrix is back.
RHCP !!!!!!
The boys are back❤️
Do caralhooooooooo!!!
Perfect that sound uh 👌 ❤
Give it up for John mf Frusciante 🥳
Hearing Johns guitar from the start brings me back home immediately (after 16 years!!!). So glad to hear them sounding like the classic old Peppers in 2022. I was afraid they'd try to make a new hip and fancy sound, but this is better than I dare to wish for.
é incrível envelhecer junto com a banda da minha vida
:DDDDDDDDDD
WOW ! This song has a 60's 70's melancholy and it's beautiful
JOHN IS BACKKKKK
Best band for traveling!!👏
Histórico.
I told myself I wouldn't cry but I definitely failed.
Been waiting so long for this moment
Epico, gracias por entregarnos su Unlimited Love ✳🎶🍃 😌
THE LEGEND IS BACK!
colapso🙏
What a fucking renesance!
You could tell by the overlong and pretentious statement for their comeback that it was written by the guy that gets to come and go as he pleases at the expense of whoever has put their time into the group while he goes on his latest drug binge. They did that last guy dirty AF. I can think of another band in this genre that is a trillion times better than would never do their homes dirty like the peppers do. Listen to 311 instead. One hot minute>>>>>everything after californication
Me sentí como la primera vez que los escuché, se me eriso la piel y me sentí como las primeras veces que esmpesava a escuchar. Sin duda la mejor banda.
Brasil 🇧🇷
Ohhhhh siiiii es bueno verlos de nuevo, vamos RHCP 🤘🏻
Love it
I love you so much guys <3 John come back!!! Long live the Red Hot Chilli Peppers!!!!
É a banda que eu amo!
THATS AWSOME!
❤️
Crack John Wick en la viola 🤘
🥰 Use 👍 on my comment like EXTRA like for this stuff🥰
Gran tema postumo de  Diego Verdaguer
You fired Josh for this?
What a difference with John back on guitar! Awesome!!
I feel like in the 90's
Outro som com a formação original!
Stadium Arcadium vibes ♥
My god 😍😍😍
os brabos voltaram
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS BABY🔥🥵
Gracias por volver
Love it! I've literally been playing the song on repeat all morning. 👍
I love it <3 <3 <3
😍😍😍😍😘❤❤
I love Fruciante and the Peppers and I am stoked that they are back together, but this song sounds like it was a leftover from Stadium Arcadiun after it wasn't good enough to make the album.
Yoo AK got a mullet now 😳
El sonido fresco y característico de los RHCP con la formación original aunque tiene un aire al Californication, saludos desde Lima, Peru..
LO ESCUCHE COMO 10 VECES YA. INCREIBLE
Wow! 💛💛💛💛💛😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
John Frusciante está de vuelta :') Tmr llore! <3
Acho que e a melhor banda de  rock tocando na atualidade! Os kras tocam demais
This sounds great, good job!
Up 🤘🤪
Отлично-отлично, мужики, так держать! Old but gold, its about you, guys! 😅✊

NUNCA FUI TRISTE. RED HOT MINHA RELIGIÃO
Frusciante και η γκρίζα ύλη στα κιγκλιδώματα !!
What would be a life without RHCP? 🙇‍♂️
A beautiful video..like the colors of Around the World.
FUCKING GLORIOUS!
8h after publishing 866 219 views and 134 000 likes… incredible, amazing song too
I really really hope you guys come to South Korea and jam some music. I don't think you guys ever came to South Korea from what I remember. Plus, I want to see John Frusciante, since he is my favorite guitarist :)
Thank God aka #JohnFrusciante
Machete kill! Dany Trejo in vocals 😎🤣🤣
Hi Guys https://youtube.com/shorts/2BBq0UmQhWI?feature=share
Всем нам нужен новый альбом
Fruscccc!!!!!! 😁
John Anthony Frusciante (Nueva York, 5 de marzo de 1970) es un guitarrista, cantante, compositor y productor estadounidense. En la actualidad es el guitarrista de los Red Hot Chili Peppers, con quienes ha grabado cinco álbumes de estudio en los periodos 1988-1992 y 1998-2008. También tiene una larga carrera solista activa, habiendo lanzado doce álbumes y 5 EP en solitario; sus grabaciones incluyen elementos que van desde el rock experimental y ambient, hasta New Wave y música electrónica.
It would fit right in with any of the old RHCP albums! Out of curiosity how come so many of the comments are Spanish?
Waiting  for new vinyl album
Holy FUCK IT'S JOHN!!!!!!!!!
Long live John Frusciante!
Amazing 🥰
joe exotics vibes
Love it 👍
This is as RHCP as it can get. It's a sound that evokes in me feelings of nostalgia of living my youth in the 90s/00s...
I only came here to see if they say California ..like always.
All due respect to Josh, Dave, Hillel, Jack.... but RHCP will forever be the 4 guys in this video. There is a certain undeniable chemistry that they have together. Its both a good thing and a bad I guess... I've always said that the mark of a great musician is to be a member of RHCP (for any period of time)... so if they're all great musicians, they should be able to work with so many different people and get the same result, but I think John elevates them to a completely different level.  Gotta say though, Anthony's 2010's hair choices have been realllll weird for me. If he can't grow it long anymore, just go for a buzz cut man.
❤️
Wau
Can’t stop addicted to Black Summer shindig
this so cool !!!!
No words for this vibration!! Wowww!! Thanks RHCP!! 😜🌶🌶🌶🌶
Dutch van der linde
Loved the behind the sun lyric for Hillel. Beautiful song and so glad to have new music from the best band of all time!
Sin duda, con Frusciante vuelven al ataque !!! Congratulations !!! You have make my day boys.
Voltaram pra fazer música de 3 minutos pro TikTok
0:46 when I just saw john strat I get instantly happy to see these four killers again together and I just smile thru watching the whole video 💜
i cry...
X 1.25
Rock não morreu
Now THIS is the band i saw live in Panama almost 20 years ago
Alucinante!
Amazing!! John is incredible
INCREIIIBLEEEEE,UN HECHO HISTÓRICO PARA EL MUNDO DE LA MÚSICA,LOS AMOS !!!❤🌶❤🌶❤🌶❤🤘😈
Love the minimalistic recording. No overdubs. When Frusciante solos there's only Flea en Chad you hear in the background. Gives it a very live feel. A clear step away from the multi layered recording on Stadium Arcadium. When release?
What im feeling now watching this video, this is happiness
I first saw RHCP in 1987 been a fan ever since
GOOD MUSIC
Oh hell yes yes yes yesssssssssssssssssssssss!
That autotune… 😢
Anthony pronunciation of words like “sailor”, “dark”, “never”, and “archer”  in the verse are so fucking weird lol. I’m so glad Frusciante is back! He’s a musical hero of mine.
Tem fuzz, tem modulações, tem acorde suspenso, tem camisa xadrez e tem o Kiedis sem camisa. Red hot tá de volta.
I am crying watching this in the metro now. It brings so many emotions. I feel like I'm getting together with my old friends. Missed you guys so much. You bring joy to my life
Honestly, upon first listen this sounds just as much as any song by them when they had Josh with them. Sounds good and all but ultimately generic and over produced IMO. Still it's great to see them back and still doing it. Hopefully what comes next will be even better.
👏👏👏👏
☝️✌️
Simplemente hermoso, un viaje al pasado
Gracias por aún darme un sonido particular  y hermoso RCHP  los amo :'v
Surely I can’t be the only one disappointed in this? I guess I was hoping it would be closer to their early early stuff and not just a follow on of Stadium Arcadium. Don’t get me wrong there are bangers on that album too but I just miss the BSSM/ by the way era where everything felt a lot more honest and raw and less of this kind of over produced stuff. I’m sure there will still be some good stuff on the new album though, this is just not my personal taste.
🌶🖤
Sem palavras... Apenas chorei! John voltou!!!!
Daaaaamn what a song, what a vibe, what a solo! Incredible homecoming Jhon and all of you guus are amazing, i love you so much thank you! RHCP forever!!! 🤟🏽
Long live the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, the band of my life,  is incredible. ❤❤
Anthony Kiedis (Grand Rapids, Míchigan; 1 de noviembre de 1962) es un músico estadounidense, vocalista y líder de Red Hot Chili Peppers. Figura en el puesto 27 en el listado de Los 100 mejores vocalistas del Rock de todos los tiempos.
Judging by the comments, you seem to have lost your American base. I used to listen to you guys, I moved to California, then I found out you were full of shit like all the other sell out bands from the grunge era. Enjoy your money while the world crumbles around you
Welcome back John ❤️
Anthony Kiedis looking like Joe Exotic in this video.
Sério! John de volta a banda é outro RHCP, que timbre de guitarra tem essa canção! Crlh!!! 😍 Ansiosaço pra abril! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thanks for the music and the gift of being together again! 🥺🥳❤️‍🔥
Actually surprised they’re on trending against the music we have nowadays
Does anybody else hear Nick Drake in the first minute and half?? Wow... weird.
De lo mejor, que bueno que volvió mi banda favorita, sin duda los mejores🔥
The boys back on the road
I don’t understand how people could like this music
Idk man... eh. Still love you tho
Thats amazing
How old does he have to get to lose his abs?
Eu não chorei não, você chorou. Que momento, amigos!!! Vida longa a essa banda maravilhosa.
Will Ferrell still kicking it I see
BACKKKKK!
No Words ....❤....
Que vasto repertório de músicas incríveis essa banda tem, está e mais uma ! Obrigado Red Hot Chili Peppers por esta a tantos anos nos fazendo feliz. 🌶 ❤️
That guitar solo was amazing!!!!
I loved the Redhot until I felt that all their songs were repetitive or as if they were one. This song made me think of a diffidence, I am sure that the album will be full of guitar solos and new compositions, I would be liked more than ending up symphonic.
Without a doubt, one of the BEST music videos of the band's history. I'm VERY happy.
Me reiniciaron la vida,gracias John Frusciante por volver,los amo Red Hot Chili Peppers❤son la perfección🙅
Lendária Stratocaster do Frusciante, pqp ❤️🙅🏻
Espectacular!!
Los esperamos en Argentina 😘
bienvenido de vuelta maestro.
Who else has this song on loop?
Why a stupid cheap green screen
At first i wasnt a fan of the song but i started to really enjoy it after listening to it a few more times. This song is actually really good in terms of musical structure. And it felt so good to see John back after a long time.
Surtyhk de parsaeina, mesic, le magnifico
I Love new Song, Love john
RHCP never fails to amaze me. Their music is just so distinctive and the fact that they were able to keep their style throughout the decades is just…INSANELY inspirational!
John’s guitar solo here is an instant classic. It should be filed with the all time greats. My expectations for this upcoming album are suddenly thrust into the stratosphere.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOS AMO MALDITA SEAAA
eu to passando mal É RED HOT CARALH*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! É FRUSCIANTE PORR*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
QUE SAUDADES!!!!! MELHOROU MEU DIA 1500%
The wait was worth it.
Yessss!!! ❤️🔥🌶🤘
classic! it's not REALLY the peppers without John Frusciante. sounds GREAT! also, i can play all the lines that Flea plays, but i will NEVER be able to get that feel and vibe. legend.
It hasn't been even 12 hours since it's come out but I already know it by heart, didn't know I needed them so much.
Lyrics "Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
😭😭😭😭😭 Regresaron
Uncle John is back!
qer
Sinto saudades do Red Hot dos anos 90, como o álbum "Blood Sugar sex magic" e o "One Hot minute".Red Hot caiu na mesmice.
Thank you Anthony.
This is red 🔥 hot, but I'm cold cuz it's chilly
RHCP has been there in my life since i was a BABY, parents told me i couldn't sleep before i listen to Californication. it's 20 something years later and they're still here. i hope i can see my kid vibing to this song with me in the future, that'd be epic.
Paaaarce...que alegría volver a ver juntos a los 4 🔥🌶️🔥🌶️ RHCP 🌶️🔥🌶️🔥
Red Hot Chili Cowboys
❤️❤️❤️
Magnífico, show,  que música sensacional, Red Hot Chilli Peppers cada vez melhor 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘!!
Mid tier chilli peppers.
Minha banda favorita pra sempre!! Minha sexta agora ta melhor ouvindo essa obra de arte vlw RHCP
Good to see them back together, however this sounds boring to my ears. And what's with Kiedies way of pronouncing the 'R' like he's a pirate or something?
Awesome song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Obrigado 2022. RHCP de volta. Let's GO!!!
Melhor banda de todos os tempos 😍 John frusciante voltou galera 🎸😍

El solo hecho de verlos juntos ya es demasiado 🥺. Es una obra de arte completa 😍
A bit uninspired. Hope the rest of the album is more interesting.
Glad to see Will Ferrell back behind the kit.
Estoy muy muy contento de verlos juntos de nuevo y más porque el video salio en el dia de mi cumpleaños, flor de regaloooooooo jajajaja

terrible in all its glory.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Chad's base has Californication vibes, while John's has By the way ones with a new touch. They went back to old sounds, mixing them with  new inspiration, the peppers essence. John is back, the chilis are back!!!!!!
A emoção e saudade de ver e ouvir a melhor formação ❤️ Frusciante você é perfeito, entenda! 🥲
Amo vocesssss
I’ve been listening to them since the Californication days. After every album, they’re just constantly evolving to attract new generation of listeners. They’ve been doing it for 40 years. What other band has done this? No one. They are the best band in the world.
Es como si no hubiera pasado el tiempo de "Stadium Arcadium" hasta hoy... suena increíble!
Obrigada caras, só obrigada! 🖤🌶
always amazing 😍
I love this band so much . After so many years they still create amazing music and they’re aging like fine wine. Can’t wait for the rest of the album 🥰
Tempesta ormonale!🌶️🔥🎸💪
mis viejitos volvieron! Vigentes y rockeros! vamos aqui de nuevo!
yess
Que saudade dessa antiga formação dos ChiliPeppers
So happy John is back again. Without him their music is just missing that "something:
Dios miooo!! Han vuelvoooo!!! Gran canción por cierto!
Kiedis is just awful. Frusciante is brilliant.
Siento un poquito feo por josh, pero qué bonito tener a john de vuelta
em 2017 eu imaginei como seria as novas músicas com o john na banda novamente e meu sonho foi realizado, ver eles juntos novamente com a essência clássica da banda. Mal posso esperar para o lançamento do novo album!
Genocide / Mass sterilization isn’t cool. Condemn Chinese aggression.
Day one.
Tinha horas que eu não acreditava mais que esse dia chegaria... é a banda da minha adolescência!
Welcome back guys, GREAT SOLOING JOHN <3
Better together... Finaly the real RHCP!!! Hugs from Brazil!!!
This made my day way better !
Welcome back Sir John
LOS AMO! Son demasiado grandes!!
long live rock and roll. glad this group is in tact ...they sound phenomenal...Anthony doesn't age.  he sounds great, and the band delivers the classic sound on this one while keeping it fresh...
Fuaa volvi a tener 16 años por un momento, que nostalgion :)
Dude wtf this is the most disappointing thing ever.. they release this on my birthday. I had high hopes this fell short.
Jamás supe quién es dios, ahora lo conozco y es Frusciante. Gracias por tanto
Hell yeah!  They are back!
Whoaaaa!!! So excited! The most consistent band in their type of music & essence! Congrats on this new single, we’re waiting for another’s to come!
Br
Absolutely Legends 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Anthony sounds different to me. His vicals sound like hes younger days. Please get rid of yr mustache
i was not a fan of the vocals at first, but the more i listen the more i feel it
Una joya!!!!!
English...
Really nice, pure RHCP sound reminiscent of their peak. The band is always so much better when John Frusciante is there.
As much as I hated how things went down with Josh, I must admit that I love this sound so much. ❤️ Brings me back to my BEST times, it inspires me and it moves me so much...
Musica nova! Muito boa!
Que rico tocas la guitarra mi papi John!!

True story I just sent the link to this song to my friend and told him it reminded me of the song I helped him with over quarantine (he sent me a guitar and voice track and I layered drums on it). I couldn’t remember the name of the song for like 5 minutes after I texted him but then I remembered it was a cover of “Slow Cheetah” which I had totally forgot was also RHCP. It all makes sense now 🤦‍♂️
That moment where John hits that riff in the beginning is indescribable
LOS AMO LA CONCHETUMARE
Gracias por darle sentido a mi y a nuestras vidas, que sería de ustedes sin su creación y carrera, sin duda alguna ustedes son los mejores y siempre serán los mejores. "Larga vida a la buena música" 😎🤘🏻
Love you guys ❤️
かっこいい😍 ジョンのギターがまた聴けるなんて思っていなかったので感動しています ツアー頑張ってください！！！！ 日本で見たい！！！
Caramba cara que pedrada de música hoje acordei com essa mortificação perfeita
niiiiiiiice
🌶
Como eu amo essa banda! 🥺❤️
1M? Debería tener esta obra de arte ya 300M compartan cabros digan que esta de vuelta Papá Frusciante 🤍🌶
I AM A LOVE YOU!
So good ...just awesome  yeah, this is also a sweet chill vibe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euTF_LYDGUE
Ai caralho!
Aburrido.
Brutal,morí al ver a frusciante
Another number 1 song soon!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥RHCP Forever
I'm glad they never changed their style. For me They're found this sound in by the way and never changed it
38 years layer and they're still killing it. Gotta love the Chili Peppers 🌶
O PAI TÁ ONNNN!!!!!!! PQP!!
Lança mais um álbum e o jonh fruciant sai da banda, já estou esperando isso.
Frusciante ♥️ thanks RHCP ♥️
*guitar, bass, and drums sound immaculate* Kiedes: “alright boys, i’m gonna do an irish accent that’s gonna blow this song out of the water”
заебобс
Why is every comment in spanish? Did I miss something???
Unlimited love for you guys.. Son realmente lo máximo!
Why is Anthony singing with an Irish accent??
I was pleasantly surprised this is authentically RHCP. Feels it would be at home on Californication, love you guys
thank you red hot chili peppers, for everything! thanks for help me, for the happiness to listen all your songs, to make me happy in my sad moments, thank you for your lyrics and melody, always the same essence, I love you all, and I will love you until the end ♥
Old soldiers never die🔥🔥🔥
Will Ferrell killing it on drums! wooow
We've been waitin', we've been waitin – waitin' for a Chili Peppers album again ❤️
Sonzera!!!! Muito bom tê-los de volta juntos!
Love it
Can’t wait for the new album, John Frusciante is back and RHCP are back in full swing ❤️
My day was shitty. Until now.
Is a amazing song. But at the same time i hope hear more new funk songs with jhon .
A ENERGIA DESSES CARAS É TRANSCENDENTAL
Perfect news for my Friday. Bless you guys for still being yourselves.
É maravilhoso vê John Frusciante novamente na banda
Borat?! Is that you?!
Hell Yes🤘🏽⚡️🤘🏽
These men age well.
Can't wait to see them this Black Summer 🖤🖤🖤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Welcome back john
The legends return
Bem-vindo de volta, John ❤️🔥
Sonidaso!!, no habrá mejor guitarrista para los RHCP que Frusciante
Love it...but is it me or is his voice a bit too edited? Sounds like his voice is captive and manipulated a bit too much.
Incríveis, nada menso que isso. Desde sua fundação esses caras conheceram diversas bandas de peso surgirem e acabarem e eles continuam, e continuam a fazer música significativa e de qualidade. O último remanescente ativo do rock em décadas.
On bass guitar of flea... what a stick? Lenin?
These guys keep rocking!!!
LOS AMO POR LA GRANDISIMA CHUCHA!!!!!
We all have missed your music, welcome back!
Obrigada ! ❤🇧🇷
Temazo
Anthony is allergic to t-shirts
Quanto tempo esperamos por isso!!!  =D
damn i miss josh but damn this is good why so many makakos tho :v?
Excelente... Com o retorno de John frusciante 🤘 🇧🇷
LOVE YOU ALL, FROM BRAZIL ♥
Eargasms, Eyegasms, All round wholesome gasms!!!
Sabia que esto sería un éxito, excelente musica buen sonido, buena voz  ( Red Hot Chili Peppers x100Pre )
Man, I used to love hippies....now we see it was all fake... their all just corporate sell outs. Neil Young, Ben & Jerrys, Rage For the Machine, and yes, even RHCP....all millionaire elitists trying to tell us to go green while they fly around in their private jets. F these people.
didn't have to put black bars in video file, youtube could handle aspect ratio for you...
Johns back?  OMG wow!!  Lovely tune lads.
I might actually cry. It makes me so happy to see them all together again, making beautiful music as always. Love from Ohio ❤️❤️❤️
Buena cancion. Red Hot without this guitar player is just a garage band.

Darauf hab ich gewartet. Holy shit! Endlich <3
happy to see it, jhon is back at his house (RHCP)  greetings from me who is in Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩
Omg!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Toda una vida junto a vosotros, aún no me creo que vaya a veros en Sevilla por primera vez este año... os quiero. <3 TEMAZO!!!!!!!!
They did again 👏👏👏👏
They always keep the good stuff comin'
RED HOT ESTÁ  VIVO! <3 LOVE U GUYS/ KISSES FROM BRAZIL
This was necessary for my life, thankyou RCHP.      MASTERPIECE!!!
RE GOD, es perfecto
Bien jugado 😎👍🏻💥
I smell a Grammy Award! 👏🏽✨  🌶❤️
Algo que parecía imposible, volver a ver a estos monstruos juntos. Simplemente agradecido, las veces que soñé con este reencuentro, larga vida a los Peppers 🌶🫀
I cant wait to listen the album
Круто. Как в старые добрые времена.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤😁😁😁❣️❣️❣️❣️ from Caracas Venezuela 👏☀️👏🇻🇪
Simply the best
Ooooh boooy
Jueputaaaaa es que los amo ❤
Obrigado por voltar John!! Só essa música com você, já superou os dois álbuns com o Josh!
Gracias por acompañarme en mi infancia adolescencia y ahora
Ya puedo morir en paz 😭
Wow that Rick Rubin interview was dead on! Stadium Arcadium feel for sure. So excited Frusciante is back
Welcome back John!
Es emocionante apreciar material nuevo realizado con Frusciante 🎸 👌 simplemente épico! 🤩 Mis ídolos!! 🌶️🔥
What I find genius about these guys in this line up with John is they’ve mastered writing radio rock songs a lead singles.  Dark Necessity is a great song, but at 5 minutes and a slow build up it was never going to get the rotation it probably deserved. Black Summer feels like it goes for 2-3 minutes yet it runs for just under 4. Is it their greatest song? No, but is it a great way to re-introduce John into the band 16 years after their last lead single together being Dani California.  It highlights Johns much loved Hendrix vibe. The only gap for me is the lack of John vocals in the verses which could have lifted the empty spaces of AK’s almost Irish/Celtic spoken word.  I’ve listened to it 20 times and I really enjoy it.  I’m 46 and first heard Knock Me Down in 1990 as a 14 year old. I love them as much today as I did then.  Outside of Give it Away & Scar Tissue, none of their lead singles have really blown me away. I liked By the Way, Dani California, Higher Ground, Warped & Dark Necessities (can’t remember the lead single of I’m with you as it was pretty forgettable to me), but none of these songs were anywhere near close to my favorites off the albums.   Keep that in mind before judging too critically
Love you John thank you !
Crap
💫 Californication 2022 💛 (the meanings hidden in this song! Wow!)
No puedo dejar de escucharlo :)
Os maiores, não tem comparação
There a better band with John back , he has had his ups and downs in the past but still there best songwriter
Vida longa ao RHCP!!!!
Uhuuuuuuuuu
Они вернулись ещё лучше чем когда либо, им по 60 лет уже, а энергетика всё такая же как 20-30 лет назад, спасибо вам 🙏
3:33 mute cymbals lol
Love from 🇮🇳

De los más grandes del rock.
Em meio ao caus de uma pandemia uma notícia boa
No sabía que Diego Verdaguer cantaba en RHCP.
The vibe of Jimi Hendrix - hey babe (new rising sun)
We've missed you Frusciante! <3
Música razoável, mas fico feliz pela volta deles a ativa principalmente com o John.
新曲嬉しいけど、これを生で聴くには今年は流石に厳しいだろうな。。
Que fodaaaaaa! Caras, eu amo vocês. Obrigado por trazerem a boa música de volta ahhhhhh
THEY ARE BACK 😁
Love you forever of eternity❤❤❤❤
O solo precisava ter acabado aos 2:24. Os 10 segundos finais é muito ruim
I wish I could give this a million likes 👍🏼 😂 so good !
I cryed listening the song, this song is so cool!
Parece que acabei de ver outro filme genérico da Marvel.  Mesma fórmula batida dos anos 2000, 0 ousadia, 0 criatividade. Me senti decepcionada.
Hermoso, hace mucho que esperaba esto y verdaderamente quedé satisfecho. I love Chili peppers🔥
🧡
See you in Cologne this Summer. Hopefully.
Só brazil nos comentários slk . Rhcp porra
I was so fired up when I saw this come up on my YouTube at like 2 am. The excitement and anticipation were worth it, the best band in the world is still making music and that right there does my soul good. I put this song on, closed my eyes, and savored the unique experience that is hearing a new peppers  drop. 🌶  Magik.
vinieron para quedar por un buen tiempo más
🤘🏽🌶🌶
I always forget that Will Ferrell plays drums for RHCP
ALWAYS A GOOD START TO THE DAY,SOME HOT CHILI PEPPERS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
i cant believe kiedis sang a full song after 6 years without saying california
Esta banda no son de este planeta. Tremenda bandaza muchos exitos para los Red Hot Chillo Peppers ,siempre con buena musica .❤🎸🎸🎸
Ladies and gentlemen, John Anthony Frusciante is back!!!
Love it but I kinda wish they had a place for josh in the band
I got serious Under The Bridge vibes during that first green screen shot of John <3
That stache is giving me some serious Dirk Diggler vibes😂
não tem como essa é a melhor formação do red hot
Flea no se cambia por nadie volviendo a tocar con frusciante. Que química madre mía.
Finally....
At this point Anthony is just flexing his body
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <3 <3 <3
This video reminded me of "Breaking the Girl" with the natural backgrounds - minus the outfits :) Love the mullet :D xxx
Eu gosto da banda mais a música é horrivel comparada com outras que já ouvi
No tengo palabras para describir todo esto... ojalá ustedes fueran eternos ❤ no me imagino vivir sin su música... detesté la espera pero escuchar este lanzamiento hace solo que mis ojos se empapen de lágrimas... que momento para estar vivo! Gracias, gracias de verdad RHCP.
YA quiero el Discoooooooooo ahhhhhh
Toda arrepiada 💚💛❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Finally we get something. Song is good👍 . Frusciante sounds badass
2 verses, and 2 minutes of chorus?  Not exactly the reunion i was hoping for.  And i mean... they don't even write this shit, they BOUGHT these lyrics?!?!?! lol.
Black Summer, te reinicia la vida...
A long time fan here, since the 90s. This sucked. Felt bland. Sounded like bad rehashing. Hope the rest of the new stuff is different. I love rhcp, but this. Doesn't cut it. Come on.
I waited so long to see john returning, omg I love this band so much!
It seems that they were true.. They were the only ones that could make us feel better
From first note you know its freaking RHCP^^
The Chilies are back ❤
ตำนานก็คือตำนาน
Кайф!
Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶 Nunca cambien!
VIDAAAAAA LONGAAAAA
Наконец-то, сколкьо лет ждали ?
John is in da house!!!
я в ахуе
Our Guitar Hero is back 😱
Có bác nào người Việt ở đây k vầy?! =)))))
I heard Jethro Tull for a few seconds at the beginning.  I love it. 😍
new stuff never as good as old stuff same with eminem
I love you. You always soften my heart when I need it. So excited to see you this summer.
🥵🥵
Así los quería escuchar!! Suenan Chill y con una mezcla de I'm with You y Californication <3
I didn't know I missed John's backing vocals more than I missed his guitar
mis padres volvieron
Que rolón
espectacular
Frusciante it's back !!
I can't believe I'm seeing john frusciante in the band again with my eyes! omg I'm so happy to see him again in nowdays.
TE AMO RED HOT
Glad Will Ferrell is staying busy.
Тарас Бульба ты снова с нами))
This is RHCPs if I've ever heard it,first time hearing this tune and it's solid.
We all needed this after so many time
Por fin cabrones jajajaja estaba esperando música nueva de mi banda favorita de Rock. Son unos genios. Valió la espera cada maldito segundo. Son los putos amos. Frusciante, Anthony, Flea y Chad 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Mandatory buy
Sounds like b-side from Stadium Arcadium. Me like it.
Almost hit flea with the microphone again 🤣
Gracias Red Hot Chili Peppers :D es un nuevo amanecer para todos 🤘🏽😭
😶‍🌫😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
Vraiment cool et le clip et génial ! Merci 🙏
😍😍😍😍😍
a pepsi shanty nevertheless
En que parte dice algo sobre california?   In what part he say something about california?
Los dioses de la musica 🐐
Llego Frusciante!!!! LARGA VIDA A LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!
미.챠.따
Jaysus, there's more than a bang of Irish trad style singing in the verses. Maybe he spent a few sneaky weeks in the west of Ireland? 🤔😁. Great to have you guys back 🤘
has that Stadium Arcadium sound, amazing.
It's really nice to see you together again! Great song.
🇧🇷🔥
Que saudade que eu tava de ouvir vocês!! O Brasil ama RHCP, pqp que lindo!!!
Yes!!!!
Pra quem nasceu escutando esse som e tem uma história interligada com esses caras, é emocionante demais poder viver esse momento. Tive a chance de assistir um show com o Josh, o que foi muito incrível.. mas saber que agora posso realizar o sonho de ver o Frusciante tocando ao vivo é surreal! Ansiedade total pra sentir essa energia de perto! Essa é minha banda... amor sem tamanho! ♥️🌶
Lieben wir!!!! ❤️
High Blood Sugar Senior Sex Magic
Los Chili Peppers siendo los Chili Peppers, gracias leyendas ❤️
i started crying as i saw john.
Me hicieron llorar de la emoción 😭😭😭
Já ouvi 50x kkkk
Não sei oque séria de mim sem essa banda ❤

Muito bom
Sempre bom ouvir Red Hot 💕 melhor ainda que voltaram a tocar com o INCRÍVEL Frusciante 🇧🇷
Si que vale la pena estar viva para volver a verlos juntos ❤ aguante los Red Hot vieja!!! 🇦🇷
Emocionante poder ver os 4 juntos novamente. Obrigado RHCP
New gutarist?
[Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
CARALHO! QUE FODA MANO! POOOORRA🥺
finally!!!
RHCP 👍👍👍👍👍
“God frusciante “ the reemergence of jfru is the best thing to witness with this band ! Now let’s fucking do a bssm anniversary tour ! Long live the peppers!

Melhor banda do mundo 😍
Gonna hit 1 mil in less then 24 hours! Crazy
I wonder what it's like on the derk side of the moon? Since when did Anthony become occasionally Irish? haha

Achei essa musica fraca quando se trata de Red Hot.
Mdssssssss, n acredito noq vejo
Hola a todos.
Sensacional!!! 👏👏👏👏😎
Will ferrel is getting better at drums
Anthony looks like he took a part time job as a roofer! He should join the Truckers Convoy!
🔥🔥🔥
Exxxqueça tudo, os caras estão de voltaaa!!!
This is a very red holly chilly pepper video. Nice
So awesome to see JF back!!!!
The kings is backkkkk 👑
Por fin !!
John Frusciante is really good in making simple yet impactful guitar riffs. 🤟
Nossa melhor banda de todos os tempo ,,bom pelo menos pra mim!!!!
wat da
Veo los comentarios y solo pienso que es pura nostalgia. La canción como tal, vamos a admitirlo, es mediocre. Es mediocre si usamos de comparación temas de ellos incluso del anterior album.
This part in my life, this little part, is called happiness.
New Red Hot Chili Peppers song, hell yeah!
I see Mr Flea is Very Happy
They are back!!! ❤️
Classico sound RHCP che piace sempre
Isso é bom demais!
Vamos que vamos! Se viene un gran álbum
Esa no me la esperaba, pero aun asi me encanta
god this is the stuff
So cool they got Will Ferrell for the drum work!
The boys are back!
Naaaaaa, están totalmente locooooos!!!! 🔥🌶❤️
This is a soulless autotuned pile of... lazy composition. I don't care if it's big in Peru or Argentina. That's like cheating
Desde the getaway los extrañaba muchachos :')
A energia continua entre eles , Viajei no Solo do John , gostava do Josh também baita músico , mas como falei o quarteto mais top é esse ,Simplesmente F@d4 , Vida longa ao Red Hot 🤟🎸
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nice
He looked like danny trejo
Anthony is clearly an alien bc he never ages
Excellent track from the 🌶, but why is Anthony singing in an Irish accent 🤔
What?!! It's out ? Yessssss.The peppers are back
Es re western el tema, re Diango, tremendo!! te amo John, como te extrañaba...
é só Frusciante voltar pra banda que até musica nova tem ar de nostálgico!
Good music. Que alegría escuchar una nueva canción de los Red Hots con John en la guitarra. Que sigan tocando por siempre.
El regreso del mesías Frusciante 16 años después, Gracias Chili Peppers  ♥
😌
Не, ну эт заебись!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
It's been a long time ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💛💛💛💛🖤❤️❤️❤️
God, I hate this band.
The RHCP'essence.
Aeeeee , fuck
❤
HOLE FUCK, WOW GUYS!!!!!!!
Ahh, John Frusciante... I don't know why, but I feel like RHCP is not the same without him. I mean, I like all your albums, but the ones without Frusciante sound kind of empty. Can't explain it. I feel glad that you're together again. Hope to see you in Poland!
Man Will is killing it on the drums!!
Another banger!!
Eles estão de volta!!!!❤
Soul searching
Arrocha
Nunca se mueran larga vida a mis red hot chili peppers 🍺🤘 yeaa!!
THE MUSTACHE IS BACK BABY
RHCP?!  Los mejores, son mi banda favorita
Frusciante is back!! Love their music and connection. My heart is full.
¡Grandes los RHCP! Y que bien se siente ver y oír a Frusciante de nuevo con la banda.
I loveeeeeeeee <3 thanks for this!
I thought this would never happen...     But here we are.
Holy shit! Random dope drop!! TY
John Frusciante 😍❤👏
The GOAT is Back, Bring it on John!
Ufff lml RHCP ETERNO!!!! lml lml
Que alegría  poder escucharlos con una nueva canción, me encanto, lo disfrute demasiado, larga vida RHCP 💙❤
Ive been waiting FOR THIS!   Look at all the latino love!
verry goood
Welcome back Frusciante!
Genial el tema y el video 🙌 como que Red Hot volvió a tener ese sonido genial que los caracteriza. Si están John Frusciante y Rick Rubin yo sabía que se iban a venir cosas buenas. Larga vida a los Red Hot 🙌🙌🙌
Sweet. Glad you guys are back.
Can't not remind me of Danzig's song
the whole music video is really just so kiedis can flex his gains
i love you guys SO MUCH
Finally, Welcome Back. Good old classic RHCP. 😁
Flea 🤟🏼🤣
Oh me vengooooo. Voy a llorarrrrr papuuuuus.
it's an alright song.
Why are there so many spanish comments?
How many times have we heard that same Chad Smith drum beat?
John grazie di cuore per essere tornato… ho i brividi ❤️ vi amo ragazzi
There is just no matching the band with John. They just gel like no other combo.
Will Ferrel is back !
Esse é o Red Hot que um dia me viciou 🌶 Vida longa à Frusciante! Vida longa aos Peppers!
Eddie Guerrero sings for RHCP

So bitchin'! Been waiting on this big time since John rejoined! Great tones and sound from all, some stuff your doing on your vocals Anthony, reminds me a little of Gordon Lightfoot! Love your guitar sound John, I know you have so much gear but that sounds like a good ole Boss CE-2! Looking forward to the whole album dropping! Much love and blessings and thanks for the great music!
Adeus Josh Klinghoffer deixará saudades no Chili Peppers

Soooo glad John is back!! We missed you!! ❤️🌶
They've really only got one song, huh? 😅
Que presente meus amigos... JOHN IS BACK!!!!
como se nota la vuelta de john! vamo los red hot🎸💖
Only took Kiedis about a min and half to lose the shirt. Ha. So glad to have Frusciante home!
This song is awesome! I can’t stop listening. I don’t know what Anthony is up to with his vocals, but he pulls it off. John is back and lending those backup vocals and riffs. Love it!
I Love the Lenny Kravitz influence on this song
brings tears to my eyes seeing you again. thanks guys ❤️
待ってた。。。 胸の鼓動が止まらない。 みんな歳とったけど、音楽自体の進化は止まらない。 チャドはあんまり変わらないけど笑  イヤホンしてしっかり聴かなきゃ！
The king is back
i love you guys so much
Vengan a Perú o me suicido
God it's so good to see John with them again
So glad to see John pouring his soul into the guitar once more. Peppers as hot as they can ever be.
this is a dream !!!
Yes!! I'm not dreaming! It's real - they're back!
Never been so happy to see a mullet.

OMFG!! What a song!!! In the Chilli's I trust!!
A volta que todos nós estavamos esperando <3
Olha os monstros, mano!! Foda!!

This video is.......es un poo poo.  Good song though
Hablame de buena música! Ellos son los Reyes ♡  Gracias por tanto RHCP
Sounds just like the RHCP I grew up with. Glad to see John back and jamming with the boys again. Can’t wait to see them in August
os homi voltaram mesmo 😭😭😭
16 years to see John back again in the band. If this is the first glance to what their new album will be, I'm only expecting the best for it.
que regreso tan épico son unos chingones.. genial tema, video, vibra, unos verdaderos rockstars  Rock out motherfuckers 🌶🤘🏻❤
Why was Anthony on Epsteins flight logs?
🤘
F*ck You John! This is everything I needed to hear, as per usual with you. I reallly do love your creative touch and how it intertwines with those of your pals there at the Chili Peppers. This one's for me (and the millions of others that feel alike). You are an inspiration to my generation, man. Thanks for that.
New Anthony haircut, same Frusciante sound!
OMG 😯😯😯😯😯😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Udah pada tua ya :((
Almost perfect, but man, autotune takes the soul right out of a voice.
Frusciante !!!!!!! 🙏
Im just here to listen to frusciante
Thank you
Finalmente essa obra prima!!!!
Pasan y pasan los años y ellos siguen tan frescos. ¡RHCP FOREVER!❤️🔥❤️
Thank you..2022 will be great!! RHCP!!

Regressei   25 anos no tempo. Muito bom sentir essa energia na atmosfera de novo!
God, how I missed those Frusciante solos...
Wow!!!!! 😲😲😲👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

I don't think Anthony's voice need that muh autotune. So cool they're back
🤩❤️‍🔥🥲 valió la espera 🤘🏼😎 RHCP de vuelta
Today is a good day for me of course ❤️
Como pasan los años y siguen con esa misma energía. Que lindo volver a verlos tocando!! Sean eternos Red Hot Chilli Peppers ♥️🔥🔥

Thankfully that John is back😁👍🏻

I needed this music, the month already seems better, thanks RHCP
The Peppers are Back.
Легенды🤘
So great to see John back in a video missed the man never thought he'd be back
Looking forward to Sevilla in June this Year. Will be my first RHCP-Concert.  Hands up, if i will meet you there🙌🏼.
Había un gringo preguntando del por qué hay tantos hispanos hablantes xd

John and flea and Chad..
The joy from just the snippet and playing it figuring out was so much fun and now we have a whole song couldn't ask for more ✨
Yeeeeeeeeyyyy I was waiting for this sooo long
John's guitar work, amazing!
2:10 a 2:33 é o momento nostalgia dos solos de frusciante 🌶🌶🌶🤘🏼❤️

Good to see u again fruit🍓

Cuando tiempo para volver a escuchar a John, pero valió cada bendito segundo.
Eles são tão 😖😖😇😇
Los mejores del mundo!!!! Algo que parecia imposible verlo a John de nuevo en la banda y sucedió.. somo afortunados
They didn't mention "California" in the song. Are they ok?
The best 😎 Love from the guitar king of Scotland ✌🏼 🎸👑🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
This is heat
It's just a parody at this point lmao.
Anthony got in shape.
Melhor banda de todos os tempos
Ohhhh Woaw !!!! Une nouvelle chanson, enfin. Un groupe que j'affectionne beaucoup. Je suis très contente 🖤🖤🤘🏻🤘🏻
Anthony is almost in his 60s and is in better shape than me In my 20s
Melobic is sheet
Я был здесь сегодня, в этот прекрасный день!
Woah
So glad to see John hasn't lost it...
Esses caras arrebentam até hoje! Que venha o novo álbum
Omg!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😍😍😍

Arthur Shelby
Frusciante is back!
Instant CLASSIC. ♥️♥️🔥🤘🤘🔥🇦🇷
La mejor banda de la historia ❤️
THAT’S THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
AULAS CRIA
Respetos a josh, quien hizo un buen trabajo con la banda, pero esto, esto es volver a los 2000's gracias RCHP!! Saludos desde arica, chile 🇨🇱💕💕😌👌
Até que enfim
John Frusciante es mucho más que un músico increible, es algo que no se puede describir con palabras, y todo lo que se me ocurre no seria lo suficientemente justo como para explicar lo que es para mi. Es de otro mundo, un artista que solo con tocar una simple nota logra transmitir un cúmulo de emociones y sentimientos que nunca antes nadie habia logrado hacerme sentir así. Estamos hablando del que probablemente sea el mejor artista jamás concebido. Y esto, al parecer, no solo lo siento yo, Anthony, Flea y Chad se nota que se empapan de todo ese aura que Frusciante transmite, viendolos a mi parecer con una ilusión y unas ganas de crear que des del Stadium no habia vuelto a ver. No quiero desmerecer a nadie, no quiero crear una competición, Anthony, Flea, Chad, Josh, Hilel... Son unos músicos increibles, pero John no sólo es un músico increible, es mucho más que esto. Los RHCP son Anthony, Flea, Chad y John, pero el sonido es él. Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers!
El regreso de Frusciante❤😍
Why are all the comments in Spanish?
♥️♥️♥️♥️
RHCP siempre me teletransportara a cuando tenía 20 años  los amo ❤siempre será 1 de mis bandas favoritas 🤘
At long last, THIS IS what RHCP used to be, don't get me wrong, I don't know Josh as a person, but Frusciante IS what make RHCP  f-ing complete! Loved this song 😍
It sounds just like chili peppers supposed to sound ❤️🖤 long liveee to 🌶🔥🤘🏼
Que grande RHCP carajo!
LETS GO
The guitar solo sound is one of the best guitar sounds ever
Walang kupas! 🤘
26 ans que je vous écoute et vous aime , whaou j adore . Merci pour tant de talent 💋🇫🇷
Yeeesssssa🤪😎🥰🤘
I love RHCP 😎🤘🎸
Kiedis finally proper dressed up to fight invisible ninjas lol
This is just heartwarming
I’m so happy! 🥰
I have written a song specifically for you guys. Wanted to send it last year but had to finish up a patent and launch a second LLC. The song is called "Indigo" its badass old school RHCP and can be yours for 10k. HMU  A taste.. "black was that july - Painful.. was the lullaby.. I heard your child singing, while your wife beside him cried.."
My childhood
- Incrível ! Vocês voltaram mesmo , amo demais !!
EPICO EPICO EPICO, ESTO ES UNA OBRA
A melhor do mundo, trilha sonora da vida !!
Se alguém duvidava que o Frusciante era a alma do RHCP, agora não duvida mais.
Very good!
thank you guys, for everything, for all those years
❤️
It's so wonderful to finally hear all those pieces back together again, nothing hits better than the chemistry between them four.
tuve que esperar 6 años para poder deleitarme de vuelta con sus canciones
chili peppers are not chilli peppers without John Fruciante......thank the lord he is back and the team is complete....now the vibe is complete....never again do I want to see a Navaro or Kliffhonger whatever playing the guitar in the peppers. their vibe is perfect with John and always has been...blood sugar, BTW, Californication, and stadium illustrates that perfectly!!
And goodness I love this song
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
por isso o John é foda, o Josh jamais faria um som desses
AMAZING 😍
não sabia que eu precisava de uma música nova do RHCP até eu ouvir essa maravilhosidade de música
You can tell John is back from the first note. This is peak level chilli peppers
It was obvious that with john after these years its gonna be something more and its more that just perfection
💕🇧🇷
CADÊ O BRASIL PRA COMEMORAR A NOVA ERA FRUSCIANTE? 🤎🇧🇷
Immortality!
Haven't listened to anything of RHCP since Stadium Arcadium. Now, my friends... we meet again.   Welcome Back, John 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
what a day to be alive
HER MO SO
That guitar riff into the second verse gives me some big Jimi Hendrix vibes. Little wing?
Goodness I love Flea
Why are there so many spanish people lmao
The best part of this song was the solo.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Marcando presença nesse momento épico!!
Los amo con la vida wachoooooo
¡Gracias por Regresar! <3
This song is good, it sounds good, it feels good. Nostalgic, sad and happy, it hit me right in the heart for sure.
TOP
This is beautiful music to my ears, literally
I feel like I time traveled back in 90's😊
Gracias por volver a darnos esta increíble música que solo ustedes cuatro pueden generar ❤ Es indescriptible lo que generan sus sonidos y lo que hacen vibrar 🥰🥰 Saludos desde Argentina donde hace rato que tenemos un verano negro 🇦🇷 (pero con su nuevo video todo se volvió colorido)
My hearts is beating hard after listening to this great song! How nice to know that a new album is coming. Can't wait!
I don't know if this song was meant to make me cry but it did. I lost a friend to Covid on the Teddy Roosevelt and all of 2021 I was surrounded by fire in Folsom, CA. All the while I was just waiting for the moment I would catch a disease that no one around me deemed important enough to care about. It certainly was a hellish summer and a black 2 years.
Volví a ser felíz! Infinita vida a los Red hot y su magia! Son únicos y amo que mantengan su esencia intacta! Frusciante, sos oroooo, te extrañabamossss! ❤️🙌🙌
Great!!!
Queria poder curtir esse vídeo 1 milhão de vezes! Fiquei emocionada escutando, que saudade que eu tava desse som 🥰❤
Parece com alguma outra música deles 🤔 Parece que juntaram várias partes de diferentes músicas deles em uma.
<3
Fuck yeah
Rock is alive as long as  "The Peppers" are around.
Старички уже, но все равно радуют! Тот же саунд, который ждёшь от РХЧП
Kinda missed them tbh
God I hope we get a tour 🙏
No just them get older, we all grow up with them... Long life to the RHCP!!
WTF como o Anthony consegue botar esse shape com quase 60 anos
John sounds great
John é Deus😁
Esperei muito por esse dia
Con Frusciante siempre es, al menos, bueno
Welcome back!!! 🖤
Demasiado sentimiento, los amo! Gracias por tanto, espero poder verlos pronto en latam🥺
😍
Agradecido Eternamente! Gracias x tanta música y alegrar mis días.. Los Amo💜🎼🙏🌊
Amazing!!
Hed Hot chili peppers, pikas demais😻😻😻🇧🇷
So happy to witness this scenario.
no fucking way
fuck yeh this makes me want to play guitar again
Отличная песня 👋
https://youtu.be/PZtmEAdJ8hE Slowed versiyon
The first shot of John makes him look like Jesus, walking on water 🙌✝️
Que diferencia con Frusciante, gran canción, vuelven a su sonido característico y fresco. Ya quiero verlos en vivo!
The true RHCP is back, chillers!!!
This is some boring shit...
Parece que to com 8 anos de idade denovo. Que coisa linda cara meu deus
AMAZING!!! I'm about to cry, WHAT A MOMENT TO BE ALIVE!!
Love the Peppers and John being back, song is a little underwhelming. Hope the album is better.
Q maravilhoso🤩😍 Q som incrível, como é bom ver essas 4 lendas reunidas novamente!! Simplismente espetacular 💞❤️
I love Anthony's mullet, it is terrible!
Ma, amikor mindenki újítani akar és (talán emiatt is akár)  borzalmas zenék születnek, ezek a srácok megmaradtak a hamisítatlan Chili Peppers hangzásnál. Ebből egy van öregem, és bizony az immáron harmadszor újra a bandához csatlakozó John Frusciante-nak tagadhatatlanul óriási szerepe van! 2009 óta várok / vártunk több 10 millióan, erre a zenetörténelmi pillanatra. Hihetetlen! Alig várom, hogy együtt lássam ezt a 4 csávót a Budapesti színpadon! Köszönjük John, Flea, Chad és Anthony! 🌶️🔥✌🏻🇭🇺💜
FRUSICIANTE IS HOME
Sorry, but for the title of the record, if it’s that love is real, you would not, NEVER ask money for it. To quote David Bowie; love is the thing that should be free.  So I ain’t not a fan anymore of the red hot chilli peppers. Mostly feel purged afterwards
Infelizmente eles não são mais os mesmos do californication musicalmente,o tempo passa e as coisas desaceleram,mas ainda são os Red Hot🌶 Peppers...🤘🏼🇧🇷
finally, frusciante
Todos os brasileiros que passarem por aqui vão deixar o like e sua admiração pelo chili peppers *️⃣ 🇧🇷
love the instruments as always, but whats with anthony's accent and auto tune?
Their post on Instagram made me cry. Amazing words. And behind those an amazing band. A band that is so thankful and grateful for who they are together and where they are in this point in time in the universe. I just love what they are doing. I love all the parallels that can be drawn from this song. I love it. I listen to rhcp all day everyday same hope to earn enough to afford a concert. I been waiting..
AEEEEE CARALHOOOOO
Vida longa ao RHCP 🇧🇷 JF de voltaaaaaa
Como é bom ouvir esse som! Mal posso esperar pra ver ao vivo ♥️
hermosa mañana verdad?
Anthony @1:26, "Fuck it... I'm not comfortable..."
Sounds great 🙌
GODDAMN IT ROCKS

Here's n English comment if u r searching for.
Essa é a banda da minha vida ❤️❤️🥰🤩 Que felicidade ter esse quarteto de volta🤩🤩🤩🙌🏻🙌🏻😍✨✨✨

obrigado rhcp por me proporcionar toda essa loucura emocional durante esses anos e mostrar que meu coração está otimo depois desse novo som com o mestre na guitarra !

The funny thing is that guitar sounds like Josh played it. :)
This is better than I ever expected. Beautiful song!
Amazing as always! Got tickets for June in London. So incredibly excited!!!!! Legends!
saudade que tava de um solinho do melhor!!!
Sugeng rawuh malih, maszeh...
Seeing Frusciante in a RHCP video again feels like the second come on Jesus
Awsome as always guys ✨
Class act song!Tx RHCP!
HPTA!!!! SIII 🔥🔥🔥 🌶️🔥 🌶️ LOS RHCP SON LO MEJOR!!!!! GRANDE MUCHACHOS! JOHN IS BACK!
The band is back to its roots and they sound great
LOVE U GUYS 😔💖
Wasn't so sure at first but yeah it has grown on me after the 5th listen in a row lol. Can't wait for the rest of the album
Para mí, la mejor banda sonora de mi vida. Demuestran que no necesitas superproducciones, basta con un feeling incteíble.  Sólo Guitarra bajo batería y voces. Cuando hay conexión la energía fluye sola... Y el regreso de Frusciante cumple y supera las mejores expectativas. Gracias por regalarnos vuestra música que siempre traspasa las fronteras y roza el misticismo. Y videoclip espectacular, con ese aire nostálgico al videoclip de UNDER THE BRIDGE. GRACIAS RHCP por este soplo de energía y esperanza
I"m not crying, you're crying  Fck guys, never thought this would happen. Beyond hyped
This song is mediocre but I’m so ready for more
🌶
I've been waiting for this moment for 5 years... and here we are.
Sounds like a Peppers song, no more no less. Nice song, but nothing overly exciting.
Hendrix guitar
RHCP music, great for chilling out and finding inner peace while alone on a bench🔥
Gracias por volver!! 🤘🏼🇦🇷
Acordei com a melhor notificação, obrigada por essa paz de espírito. Que saudade desses solos, que saudade dessa energia. Obrigada universo!!!!
I've been waiting for this moment for so long. Now it's like to see the sun rising up again after long period in the dark.
Frusciante ❤
You're always smashing everything ! Congrats guys! Excelente song
los reyes están de vuelta 🔥
Please don't Californication my state...
Eu amo vcs flea vc e o cara mais fodastico  de todos os tempos
Realmente impresionante, la espera valió la pena.
Obrigada por esse momento pqp ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷
Isnt Anthony close to 60? Aging like fine wine!
We love you ❤️ please come back to Guatemala
Thank all the gods John Frusciante is back, John is like Bill Ward - No Bill Ward, No Black Sabbath.  No John  Frusciante, No RHCPs. Looking forward to the rest of the record!
Nice Touch of Old Asian Music
harikasınız ulan göt oğlanları
Frusciante put colours in this!!!!!
Sou músico por causa do RHCP e suas músicas   Vida longa a melhor banda da história  Vida longa aos Peppers
No existe banda con tipos con más 60 años de edad que le pongan tanta armonía, amor y energía a su canción! No hay nadie como ellos ...Que sean eternos RHCP !!
This makes me so so happy
I came here for John Frusciante.
Anthony Kiedis is getting more and more like Iggy Pop
❤️
Showwww
ITS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
Good song. Mix of old and new love john coming back and the style funk rock sounds
We've been waiting indeed.
so this is what falling back in love feels like.
SHOW Demais... Outra Banda com Jhon Frunciant
Do you guys know when was the last time everything seemed to be alright? When new Chili songs were release in 2016.   This is a sign that things are about to be okay again... And we have a new banger ❣️
1:25  Me: Huh, Anthony's had his shirt on for an unusually long t- OH HERE WE GO!!!!
Life is more beautiful now.
El solo de Jhon es mágico... Fascinante regreso...
the mullet is killing me lol
Лайтово
Great music from these guys always.  So different.  I love Chad Smith's drumming, he's fuckin great man.  John has such soul in his lead melodies and great tone too. Anthony is a good front man and lyrics and voice are good as always.  What the fuck can be said about Flea?  He's just a groovin mofo.  Love this song gentlemen.
They're BACK back.
❤🇧🇷
Ladies and gentlemen, John Anthony Motherfucking Frusciante is back!! RHCP, i love you with all my heart!
Intro: good. Outro: good. Verse: good. Chorus: could’ve been better.
Gracias Josh por todos estos momentos, gracias John por volver 🔥

Senhores, PARABÉNS por mais um incrível som! Congrats from Brazil! ❤

Welcome back! My first international concert, I will never forget. I love you guys!
nice, californication vibe
😁😁🥰🥰🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤🤘🖤 So happy!
Ehaaa
Frusciante abú! 🇮🇪
Frusciante is predictable back. They are repeating themselves. I been a John fan and RHCP fan but this is just boring. Bring Josh back!
Why is Anthony rocking a Irish tone
🖤
Truly awesome
Anthony still the weak link of the band.
Not bad for a couple of pensioners
Daleeeeee los rejóooooo 💚
Awesome! We get Frusciante back not only on a album but in a music video and with a guitar solo!
Дима Билан на вокале неплох) А если серьезно, то клип и песня ах*енные. Ждем альбом)
Ehaaa
Наконец-то!!! Русским привет :)

I cried with happiness when they announced he was rejoining the band, and I cried again watching this. Frusciante you are an absolute GOD! Cannot wait for the tour ♡

Eu vivi pela volta dele, bem vindo de volta John!!!!!!!!!

John Frusciante... RHCP's soul. As simple as that. Finally, they are back together.
Freakin Awesome! John brings the flavor back!  No only if we could get Anthony to cut that Darn Mustache!
When that Guitar kicks in i just can't stop smiling. John is back and all feels right in the world for once..
We miss you so much jhon
🇧🇷❤😍
Frusciante 🎸🎸🖤🖤
Que hermosa canción, que emoción después de 16 años
Frusciante is back, and it's awesome ! Thank you !! 😱
My dad grew up stealing RHCP casettes from the local store, he passed them on to me... It's crazy that these legends might still be alive and kicking it when I'm ready to pass on the casettes to my kid. Hope my kids get to see these guys live. . . . Rip Dad. We miss you.
Is that supposed to be a fuckin' Irish accent?!
Non pensavo che John Wick sapesse suonare così bene una chitarra😂 Welcome Back Frusciante! Grazie Red Hot❤️
😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏
Amazing as always for dozens years ❤️👍
Love it welcome back boys
john looks like keanu reeves.
josh wasn't bad
The feeling I get seeing them together again... it's indescribable ♡
Welcome home Johnny 🥰
the should have kept Josh as a songwriter, 2nd guitarist and keyboardist
Buena musica
O Brasil se curva aos pés dessa música. Tô todo arrepiado.
Rolon
I started to like staches because of Anthony, but mullets too?
Buena musica
какие же они уже стариканы ))
Arthur Shelby you rock!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
WELCOME BACK JOHNNNNNNN, VAI CARAALAHOOO! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
that worn out strat is back  😍😍
How? How do they do it? For 30 years, their songs from the first accords have been making my heart and soul dance! With love from Ukraine🙂
Made my day. Glad to see that this new song is not following the standards for having "success". Thank you RHCP.
Wonderful, exciting to see them all together again!
LONG LIVE CHILI PEPPERS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Merging californication, under the bridge. I like the low production like no rhythm guitar during the solo. And no mention of California.
We need Red hot chili peppers live in INDIA !
Vamossss no saben como espere que vuelvan los 4 😢🤘🤘🤘
😊🇧🇴❤ Me encanta tu musica, gracias Red Hot 🔥  saludos desde Bolivia Latinoamerica.
Great to see John back
they don’t the essence, is the same, is so good can see that band keep’s streight, i love so muuuch
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷Brasil army here, come to Brasil RHCP🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
After many hours of loop, I came up with an incredibile and unique point of view:      JOHN WE MISSED YOU <3
Tremendo!!! Cómo se extrañaba la guitarra de John! ❤️😍
I cried in the solo. Welcome back John.
John 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Tiene que ser numero uno!!!
Capos!!!! Comenzamos bien el 2022
Eu amo Red Hot são muito bons por anos uma grande lenda do Rock 🤘
¡¡Larga vida a los RedHot!! Los amooo ❤❤❤❤ John!! 😍🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤
THANK YOU!
Mágico 😍
Trás a turnê pro BR 🇧🇷 pelo amor de Deus 🙏🙌...
Papers are back
Escuchando a este grupo desde que era pequeño, aquellos cassettes viajando con el walkman en el coche de mis viejos 🤣 me siento muy orgulloso de haber conocido a este grupo y de que sigan metiendo caña. Cancion increíble 👌
Disappointed
john faz toda a diferença, obg meu deus por esses caras estarem de volta!!
That's fucking awesome
Welcome back john, we love you ♥
ameiiiiiiiiiiii
🥳🥳🥰🥰🥰
new song
КИДИС ЕЩЁ ЗДОРОВЕЕ СТАЛ. 💓💓💓
love the songs, the hair is.... someting
Como si nunca se hubiese ido Frusciante
Так рад что вы снова вместе, да ещё и новый альбом, лучшая группа!
Top demais, RHCP fazendo parte da minha vida, passando a vibe fenomenal que anos atrás e até agora ainda existe, alegria imensa!!!
Anthony Kiedis to the director: "I think around the 1:26 mark would be a good time for me to take my shirt off."
Skinny Buay
me brincó el corazón al ver a frusciante jaja
วันที่รอคอยผมตายตาหลับแล้ว.  จอนน
Meu deus, são taantas sensações boas ao ouvir isso! Que delícia, que gostoso, que emocionante, que TUDO! A vibe que o John traz de volta ao RHCP é linda, bixo!
John, por favor, não saia nunca mais. Sem você a banda é um carrão com motor de fusca.
Thank u rhcp! Love for you guys! 💕✨
Vish tô arrepiado RHCP e incrível
These guys are icons & legend. It's good to see Frusiante well, + creative/ flourishing. The song is cool. But Keidis & Balzary both turn 60 in 2022. They're Rock Royalty & Elder Statesmen, not "edgy-cool" 20 somethings & need to stop pretending it's the 80's/90's. Or become a living joke like Great-Grandpa Jagger. Just make great music without fronting, "MTV" 📺 left the station going on 40yrs ago. Rock On & RIP Hillel. 🤘
FUCK YEAAAAAAAH!!! THE MAN IS BACK
Lovely solo.
The first seconds got me like 👁️👄👁️ same energy from 90s 💥😍🙌🏼 (the drums 😭)
Oh yeahhzzzz, 2022 sera l'année de Liam Gallagher et Red Hot 💙
estoy loco
JOHN FRUSCIANTE
The more you listen to this song the better it gets.  John playing to the song perfectly. Flea and John are complimenting one another better than ever.  When John left after SA Flea went back to school to study music theory (which was evident in all of Josh's albums) and he really shows up in this song. This is a great song  🎵  Anthony's lyrics fit the times and Chad is there setting the groove for the whole party.  I fucking love these guys.
6,6/10 when under the bridge is 10/10
Who's AWAKE in 2022?
Quem e do Brasil e curte essa grande banda, deixa o like ai
Christo Frusciante papa!!!!!
toooooooooooopppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Finally! :)
Can’t wait to see you guys with the Strokes in Toronto!
этот голос узнаешь из миллионов!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Liam Gallagher dropped a new single today and so does the RHCP, February it’s been amazing so far 🔥
HELLA OF A LOTTA LOVE FROM BELFAST!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
This song is fire Red hot Chili Peppers still keeping it original and on point
Still feel bad for Josh. Glad I got to see him play in the getaway tour.
Una joyaaaaaa de canción ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
Maravillosos! Pelometro al mil, se extrañaban tanto. Amé el tema... larga vida para todos.  Frusciante 💖
I've been waiting... for the RHCP to sound like this again!!!!! Love it ♥️ I can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
Big Like!!!
OMG What did I do to deserve this? 😱😱🤯🤯🥺🥺❤️
Parece increíble poder volver a disfrutarlos juntos ❤️ Se viene lo bueno!
John is rock and roll jesus
Se notan los años
Funky Black Cat chegou primeiro que todos aqui!
I ♥️ RHCP
Anthony just be tryin to scare us with his mustache these days 🙈🧔 But I'm so glad they're still around 🥰💖
Esta canción parece sacada de stadium arcadium,,nada nuevo de momento 😓
This is going to make rock and roll cool again, along with cleansing my soul
¡¡Increíble!! 🥺❤️✳️
Love it! Can not wait for the rest of the album. Thank you for continuing to make music you guys. Much love.
Wow

Fã desde os 9 anos, hoje, aos 31 anos, escutei e fiquei emocionado com essa música.   É a pura essência do RHCP, mesma energia. Muito obrigado!!!
King is back
They've became a parody of themselves
Mattingly quitese las patillas!!! El sonido Chili peppers esta de vuelta, alabado sea Frusciante
Thought that this had to have been filmed on the same stage as the Mandalorian then saw that the music video was directed by a Mandalorian director. Ehhhh!!!!!
Back to basics!
É ELE CARALHO!!!!  E VOLTOU EM GRANDE ESTILO 🔥🖤
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS FCKIN BAAAACK!!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Dammit I cried,  I didn’t want to cry today
Obrigado Deus por me deixar ver John Frusciante de volta aos Chili Peppers, vida longa a banda que marcou minha infância/adolescencia e agora a vida adulta.
Gonna miss Klinghoffer, but it’s great to see and hear John back.
Thank you boys and welcome back John. You look like you’re where you’re supposed to be please keep your mental health in check. We can’t afford to lose the lot of ya.
I missed John so much
Red hot chili peppers thank you for the memories we love you

Bordellou
A touching moment when you listen to the old-style RHCP in the year 2021 ;)
Que bueno que volvieron! 🤘❤
I wish I'm like them when I turn 59.
No way

A maioria dos comentários é br!!🤘🤘
POR FIN 😍
From the 80’s to  today and they still have the vibe that we all know and love. Never feels anything but authentic and the butterflies you get when a new song drops is the best feeling. I’m so stoked for this new album!!!
Anthony Kiedis is going to live to be 279 years old.
Hail to rick rubin...rhcp is back together..
What a way to wake up today before work an BAM fuckin awesome. All of it kicks ass the solo the hair ...Mexican Flea ...Long live Blackie an Coal

The second coming.
Wow!!!😲😆😃🌶🎆🎇✨🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Simplesmente é o dna da banda. É incrível a energia dos 4 juntos, nasceram um para o outro. Melhor banda do mundo ❤
Anyone else cry?….😂😂

This song hits just right 👌, well done Chili's.
Impresionante!! Es increíble escucharlos juntos de nuevo
Simplesmente incrível! É muito bom ouvir vocês de novo caras!

Why is everyone writing spanish here? :-D
Fuck yes!
Can't wait to see them in Nashville!!!
John Frusciante te amo
So fucking good!! I love youuu 🖤❤
John!! Welcome Home!! Thx
shy
Don’t “wait” for the black summer to end. Stand up for your GOD given rights and fight authoritarianism by REFUSING to obey unjust black summer mandates.
O que dizer?? Foda como sempre!! ❤❤❤❤
It feels so great to have them all back together. This sounds amazing. John I’m so happy you’re back. I can’t wait to see you guys in concert😭❤️  This song has been on repeat since last night and I just. Wow. That solo is what my soul needed.
0:46 ~ 0:56 pure Hendrix 😎🌶️🎸
5 listens in  and it's now an ear worm! Nothing says Summer like the peppers!
miss the energy of Josh.. wish he was still in the band
Por fin todo como debe ser💎
que trem lindo.
Amazing mullet/moustache combo! Anthony's gone full Tiger King!
MIS SALVADORES! ! ! ! !
Que gran alegría escuchar de nuevo a estas leyendas tocar juntos, larga vida RHCP 🌶️
In loop since this morning
LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the legend him self is back!
Hes rocking a bullet...what did u start mr.Tree?
Yesssssssss
Nunca cambieis , mis padres dioss❤️🔥
josh should stay  playing as additional guitar, just like their previous live earth concert
When they put out Dark Necesseties I was in a really dark place and I fell into drugs really hard. Now ive been sober for a year and a half and they release even more music. RHCP kept me sane for all those years even if life was beating me down 💪💪
Respeito aos outros guitarristas mas Frusciante é O CARA!
Todavia no caigo
Uhss
❤️👍😊 Long live
The best of my life! He is baaaack! I can't believe 😢 God bless Frusciante ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow!  Nice exotic drum beat & as always great playing by Flea.  How does John Frusciante continue to come up with these amazing guitar parts?  So right for this band!  So glad he came back to the RHCP’s!  The visuals & colors of this video are quite impressive!  Kiedis is all pumped up.  I will definitely be buying their next release!!!
Feels like 2002 again
Música muito foda, fiquei com a mente viajando ouvindo ela...
I will never understand the mustache
🤩💖
Tony farace and I wacthed this at 7:27am on 2-4-22
These exciting moments are the moments we’ll always remember. Thank you guys🌶
Damn this is so good😭😍
red hot chili 🌶 is one of the few things that still makes me grateful to be alive, i love you guys!
Hell yes John!
So perfect, once again.
Well that was as bad as i thought it was gonna be
tremendos !!
They uploaded this song only few hours ago and it's already one of my favorites, I've listened to it so many times!
Frusciante 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Não acredito que to vivendo isso, a última vez eu era criança mano, bizarro!!!
Dirty Black Summer is better.
시발 드디어 나왔다 씨발!!!!
If this is a dream, don't Wake me up! 😍🔥
Ohmygod
GRACIAS POR TODO RHCP!!!
I'm gonna start learning this bassline right now, because this may well be one of the best melodic lines Flea has ever written. I'm getting modern classic vibes from this one
GRANDE LOS RED HOTT Se pasó John frusciante 🎸🎸
Californication<<<<<<<<black summer
Hell yeah!
<3
Is Anthony singing with an accent?
VAMO FRUFRUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Anthony tapped into his TO kill a Irishman Vocals😂❤❤
más o menos nomás
पुरानी यादों के साथ भरी आवाज। एक अलग ही एहसास।
Bro they still got it great song
Me likeee
MESTRE JOHN <3
Круто! Вы лучшие! Ждём нового альбома.
God I love that Frusciante's back!!
They're another level 🔥
Amazing as always!!! John is crazy good
It's a shame about the auto tuned vocals. The rest of it is great though
Por fin! Se les extrañaba demasiado! Viva Red Hot !
Finally <3
The new RHCP is... a Metallica song. I can hear James Hetfield and the band play every second of this :)
So great to have some Red Hot new music.. Will be so grateful once this Black Summer ends... it's lasted for two years now.. longest summer ever!
Ура
Fucking awesome
I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and I'm so grateful that they're back with another album, especially now that John is on the track.. But am I the only one who feels that Anthony's voice is extremely autotuned? I've tried to get used to it, but the auto tune (for me) , takes away the soul of the song. I understand that he's getting old and all, but not too long ago in their last album, the level of auto tune wasn't nearly even close to as extreme as it is here. Other than that, I think this song's pretty fucking great, no hate to the Chili Peppers.
о май фукен гад!Жизаз!
Not very many bands that came out in the 80s can claim relevance in the 2020s.
That's a fun little number
Spectacular jam right here ❤  I needed this sweet vibe in my life! 🎶
la canción es nueva?
RHCP POR SIEMPRE❤
#JohnFUCKINFrusciante
🔥🔥🔥 Es buenísimo 😎🔥🔥
Thank You !!!
Sooooooo Happy John Is back!!!!!
You know, it's ok to fix your pandemic haircut now, Anthony.
Me alegraron el día 💖
Lyrics:  [Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip [Chorus] Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
Los Amo, los amo! Gracias por dar tanta felicidad ❤️
And just like that they are back... Man I'm so greatful to be alive and able to say I witnessed this
What a banger!
Carajo chicos llevo toda mi vida esperando ver algo nuevo con Jhon, los amo con mi vida, gracias por volverme las ganas de vivir  Los adoro RHCP
Seems happier than the last two albums.   Good vibe.  I didn't have to stop listening.  Needs to be a 5 mins song tho
Eu vivi pra ver todos juntos de novooooo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
il viellit pas
I missed John so much.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Uno no puede evitar escuchar este nuevo tema y no sentir nostalgia mezclada con una nueva aventura, larga vida a RHCP ♥
My heart swelled with happiness, like a fruit oozing juice, when I heard the unmistakable bass of Flea, John's riff and his hypnotizing chorus, Chad, the ambassador of rhythm and Anthony, the impetuous singer with mystical and original dances and a sweet spirit.
Emocionalmente vê essa formação junta... E com um som de qualidade...
John "Keanu Reeves" Frusciante back on guitar.. John looks freakishly like Keanu from John Wick
The moment I heard the guitar sound I finally realized that John is really back.
how many times did they say California in this one? ok, lemme now watch it.
pelo amor de Deus, vcs n erram uma krl
anthony is still ripped lol awesome video
Hace 14 años que estaba esperando este momento. Ahora vengan a Argentina así lo abrazó a Frusciante y ya me puedo morir en paz
Meo tema
I didn't like the weird accent Anthony has adopted. The music itself had promise. Too bad.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
🪄💔
Por favor vengan a la ARGENTINA!!!!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
holy shit
Me quedé dormido oyendo la canción...
Renace la música Sonríen las partituras Deslumbra el vinilo Se enorgullecen los oídos Celebra la radio
Massa demais 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
YOU made my day! Great song waiting for you in Germany and much love to LA
Classic
No words. So good.
Great song. Glad to have John back. I'll kind of miss Josh a bit tho
S E N S A C I O N A L ! 🤘🏻✳
I heard that John being back in the band could actually cure Covid!
This feels like RHCP song from 2006 or so, I'm so happy
Vamos John !!!!!
Wow…John really adds so much soul to the peppers sound. Welcome back! We missed you!
Age is just a number, the legends are back
Me hizo soñar y transformar mi realidad, era justo lo que necesitaba en estos tiempos, un reinicio de los RHCP. ¡De escuchar unas mil veces! Excelente.
Obrigado Red Hot, vocês foram e continuarão sendo até o final da minha vida inspiração 💞
Aaaaaah Frusciante! Que riffs! Que guitarra! Que tudo!
que hermoso :')
ANTHONY'S FATHER DIE IN THE SUMMER OF 2021, THIS SONG IS FOR HIM???
Finalmente!!
Este retorno es genial , llegaron con toda la energía que siempre los caracteriza , larga vida Red Hot Chili Peppers
🙌🙌🙌
😎👍
Mf’ing sea shanties lesGOOOOOO! “It’s been a long time since I made a new friend” 🥲😭 me too Anthony, me too.
Fruzzitoo again men Love RHCP.
Puta que paril foda demais ver o jhon de volta, que coisa linda de se ver.
THE KINGS ARE BACK! 👑
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Старики Разбойники 🤟😁🤙
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can hear the pitch correct/auto tune on Anthonys vocals and it's really off putting. The reach for "perfection" is killing music. It'd sound better if it was Keidis' authentic voice, because it'd sound more real. More human. Instead they artificially change it. The way production is going today is scary, its not just vocals, it's everything. Quantisation, the insane EQ capabilities they have today, which can basically completely alter the original take. It's getting to the point that recording a band is pointless. Because it'll be changed so much in post production, that it won't even sound like a band
Omm delay?
THANK YOU ANTHONY, FLEA, CHAD AND JOHN
Puta que paril foda demais ver o jhon de volta, que coisa linda de se ver.
😍
Automatic hit. Beautiful.
Los extrañé mucho :')
Caralho pra abençoar o ano de 2022
🥲
AK kinda looks like Tiger King with that mustache 😂
Another history
When the world needed them the most they came back!
Nada menos que incrível
THEY STILL GOT IT, I COULDN’T BE MORE EXCITED
😍😍😍😍😍
Que volta meu Deus.. Jonh Frusciante é foda 👊
Cool ❤️❤️
It’s pretty awesome they got Will Ferrell to play the drums in this video.
holy fuck johnnnnnnnnn
Cómo un buen whisky añejo...
Anthony looks better than when I saw him in 2014
Imposible dejar de escucharlos una y otra vez🖤🌶️
La espera sí que valió la pena, que gran canción. Larga vida a los RHCP ❤️🇵🇪
Omg... Epic ❤️❤️❤️❤️  John is back 😍😍😍😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Damn I can't believe how GOOD this song is ! Didn't expect that at all !!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BRASIL NESSA PORRA!!!
Our king has returned
Estou em êxtaseeeeeeeeeeee 😭😭😭😭 my unlimited love! Forever! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
YES
They are back!!!!!
Nem acredito que vivi pra ver isso
I love them!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me parecía raro que Anthony este tapado hasta que se sacó la camisa,  ahí empezó todo 😂😂
Que buen tema, es increíble volver a ver a John en la banda. Larga vida a Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤🌶
Me encantoooó 🖤. Anthony es el taxista de By the way ahora. Los amoooooo 🌶🖤🥰
VENHAM PRO BRASIL AGORA É UMA ORDEM
Iggy pop?
Welcome back home John ❤️ can’t wait to hear the whole album on April and listen to you live on Köln… What a year!
I JUST CAN SAY THAT I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUSIC RHCP!!!
A perfeição 🥺♥️
Olha aí os caras fazendo história novamente... Ouvindo em looping :)
nice work
Fantastic, good old RHCP ❤️ Love to see Frusciante again 💪🏻
OMGGGGG
I love you.
Круто, теперь будем ждать альбом
EU AMO VOCES PORRA!!!!!! OBRIGADA
Justin Long is looking good. Wish they didn't wake him up so early to make this music video. Dude was barely out of his robe.
Ficou boa mesmo?
Tyle lat czekania na ten moment...
Let's see how many years he stays this time:)
Woooooooo
where's josh? why not both?
Omg eles votaram krrrrrlllllllllll
This definitely feels like they started writing it around the “Stadium Arcadium” era
I like the chorus but the verse melody is 👎🏻 to me. And the vocal melody during the verse is weak. Nbd, not every song will be what everyone gravitates to. This isn't the song that I would've picked to be my leading single to a highly anticipated album. There was a time when of their leading singles to kickoff an album was Dani California. Imagine that. This song sounds like a B side to me.
Who shit on my man's lip why they do him like that and let him make a video wit a filthy Lopez across his face he really needs to smack his stylists for letting that emu take a dump on his lip 😳
THE ONLY BAND THAT HAVE EVERYTHING, LEYENDS!!!!!!!
The funky-feel-good melodic magiciians are back .Yes!! And Rick  behind the steering wheel alongside Fruscinte just made 2022 that much better!
OMFG!!! KIDDIS IS A UKRAINIAN!!!!
Vai tomar no cúuuuuuuuuuu, que sommmmmmm
If you didn't know John was back - yo'd have to listen to first 10 seconds of this and you'd know.  Welcome back John!
Thanks guys!  I hope some day could see you live. 🥲
I got chills when Frusciante started playing the solo halfway through the song.
Best of world.   RHCP
Esta john! Quemosion💖💜💖💜💖
I see a Will Ferrell cameo .... /s
Os caras não err nunca, pqp musica boa demais.
YASSSSSS❤❤❤❤ John and Rick onboard again❤❤❤❤
Listening to Anthony's voice reminds you of an old friend, whenever you hear his voice the moment becomes timeless.
John nailed it - as always. The tone, the Hendrix-esq licks, the mode and so on and so forth
Son los mejores! No cabe duda, temon!! 💜💓👏
Que felicidade ver eles reunidos novamente ❤ A essência permanece intacta!
HERMOSOOOO TODOOOO
What's up with the Irish diction? This is an extremely artistic track you've made, it's like the getaway album and the by the way album boiled down and mixed together, and then mixed with all kinds of magic.   I will be the first to admit, that once again, the lyrics make no sense, however it's because they're beyond my comprehension, unlike the (wonderfully) ridiculous nature of Around the World. Really interested to know how the world's greatest band came up with this highly conceptual song.  I get that, as Anthony has stated in the discussions of Stadium Arcadium, you want the listener to find their own meaning in the song, but I would love to hear a breakdown of the meaning from the master of flow himself.   Can't wait for the album to come out!
How many others feel John's playing in their soul?
It feels SOOOOO good to hear another John Frusciante solo with RHCP!!!!! Reminds me of watching him play in the “Live at Slane Castle” recording 🎸🎸🎸
A melhor do mundo!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
vcs são bradissismos
Goosebumps
Nice music
Já viciei nessa música 🔥🔥🔥🌶🌶🌶
A melhor notícia do meu dia, do meu mês foi essa música!! Simplesmente perfeita!!
NÃO TO ACREDITANDO
OBRIGADA UNIVERSO POR ESTAR VIVA!
Keanu Reeves is a great guitar player
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss
The Anthony Kiedis is looking like Lionel Ritchie
Not a fan of the pirate like twang  in his voice what's that all about .
Bring back josh
Felizzzz dmais com a volta do Frusciante!  Gostava muito do Josh mas Agora estão completos! A vibe é outra... Pura energia! Vida longa ao Red Hot Chili Peppers!!! ❤️❤️❤️
1:54 flea

Самые лучшие! 🎸😻
Still hot sounds 🌶️
I love these dudes
Glad to see you four back together again ❤️
Good to see them back together

Nothing amazing but great guitar work John!

Best Band,best: vocal,drums,guitar & bass=BEAUTIFUL SONGS

Vida longa!!!!!! Live long and prosper my loves! (And come to Brazil 🇧🇷)

Oh, I'm really surprised, awesome
No Hope, Blackpilled, no contrast in this music.
Vinyl!!!
Grandes Peppers, los adoro <3
What a fantastic guitar tone. I have dreamed of a new RHCP song with John Frusciante for years!
Cool to listen RHCP with guitars again! Yeah!!
Faz tempo que o dia não começa tão bem !!
John doesn't play just solos, he's playing experiences
Frusciante siempre frusciante 🙌🏽💫
❤️
А отцы-то еще могут!
valió la pena la espera, valió la pena!!!
Volvieron a llenar ese vacío que había quedado, nose si ellos son conscientes de la felicidad y bienestar que generan. La cancion la ame la guitarra sublime como siempre y el video excelente literal.
AMAZING! ¡ME ENCANTA! ♥
Is it only me or there is a lil of "was I right or wrong - Lynyrd Skynyrd" in this song? Amazing anyways!!!!!
Perfeição
He vuelto a soñar después de 16 años!! Gracias RHCP!
Hehehehehehe Olha quem voltouuuu  🌶🌶🌶 já prevejo novo álbum 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 hahahah kkkkkk
Not what I expected, but I'm very excited to hear the rest of the upcoming album. I am trying to digest these lyrics.  Many references to Australia. Platypus & Roo (Kangraroo).   Cremation. The bushfires of 2019- 2020?? Well Flea is from here...
Rebirth of RHCP .....
Suena a que Jesús viene y esperemos a que nos salve
Temazoo vamos los peppers
They are back! 🇧🇷
Filler song but of course frusciante is BACK!!!
Los Chili Peppers nunca morirán!!
QUE LOCURAAAAAAAAA

Need to hear the rest of the album. Nothing hooky about this for me.
Simply amazing. Welcome back boys!
What is that accent Kiedis is doing in the verse? Not hating on it, just curious.
This is what im talking about!!!! <3 amazing! long live Chili Peppers!
best line-up, glad to see you all together
How beautiful to see you all together, welcome John, the world is a better place with music. I was excited.
Lembra o álbum Californication... Muito bom ver todos os integrantes juntos 😃👍🏼🇧🇷 Adorei 👏

Good song. A bit mainstream,but with the DNA of RHCP. Keep it up
Que hermoso verlos de nuevo juntos! Son como el vino, los amo! ♥

Omfg

Anyone else searching for comments in English?
A tomar por culo trap, reggeton y todos esos ritmos que llenan las cabezas de caca. Larga viva al Rock.
putz
🙌🏻🌠🌠🌠🎼🤟🏻
Falta mucho aun, lo importante volvió Frusciante. Recuerdos a slow cheetah teniendo está última el toque y magia de la banda. Que kiedis se entere que frus está a su lado
WOW!!! AMAZING!!!
Gracias por mantener la buena música en una época donde solo existe basura.
Great song! But what's with Anthony's accent??? I just love it!
PQP!!! Que som nostalgico. 🤘🏾🇧🇷
let me tell you how i love the band and flea ..
Tanto tiempo los espere... pero en el fondo de mi corazón siempre supe que volverían!!!!!! Como soy viejo me emociono y no me avergüenza... VENGAN A LA ARGENTINA, SONDE ESTA EL PUBLICO MAS SALVAJE!!!!
Classic RHCP
So he's really sticking with that porn 'tache huh?
I fucking love it!!! Thanks Red hots, I've been waiting for many years
Maybe this could’ve come out, not in the dead of winter.. 🥶
Here we go.. same climate!
Song was sub-par but they maintain their sound. Long term fan and while my musical inclinations have changed, they are still on fire. No pun intended.
It is happening! Thanks Frusciante!! ❤️❤️
it just sounds right!!
John Wick is on guitar guys. Don't even try!
Wow their new guitarist looks just like John Frusciante!
TOP PRA CARALHO!
Love you forever ❤❤❤👏👏👏👏🎆
Que música foda !! Eu amo pra crl essa banda ❤❤❤❤
Божжжее, неужели я дожила до этого момента 🔥
O John voltou e é isso que importa! Que sensação maravilhosa depois de anos achando que RHCP nunca mais seria esse RHCP. Vida longuíssima!!!!!!
Como assim nenhuma menção a Califórnia, eu tô no video certo?
ไพเราะ ดืๆๆๆๆ
Fuck Autotune.

Feeling privileged to witness this special group of 4 work as a unit again. John, how we missed you!!!
Thank you for coming back!
Feliz demais por poder viver esse momento. Gostava do Josh, mas sentia muita falta do John. Red Hot Chili Peppers é isso que tá nessa música, conseguiram capturar a essência do som da banda e trazer de volta. Vida longa ao Red Hot!
I love you!!!! I'm very happy to see you together again. Come to Brazil please!
my man Anthony jacked as fuck as always

Increíble, como si fuera la primera vez que los escucho ❤️ casi con lágrimas en los ojos por ver a John de vuelta. Larga vida a los peppers
I’m so excited!!! Thank you for this ❤️🇧🇷💙💙
This song is just amazing. It was worth waiting sooo much time for John to return, Im gonna miss Josh but sorry not sorry, Frusciante is the goat!!!!!
All right song
in this is the moment i think the life is Beautiful
reminds me of some of the one hot minute vibes
Come on, guys! We've been waiting for you 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷✨
AHHHHHHHHHH 🔥
i love this guys, they are amazing,🥰🥰🥰

RHCP is back at last, like a phoenix from the ashes!
Finally! John is back back guys..

(White mountain side)?
I'm so happy right now 💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🥳🥳
¡Frusciante no te vayas nunca más! <3
Great to see you all and jhon Furciante 🥰
It’s fun being a Chili’s fan when they are now classic rock, and they’re keeping it classic. And nobody else compares.
With John you are complete again. 😘
Red hot chilli is back......
Ahora sí volvieron los Chili Peppers.
I've been waitin....yea that sums it up. I had tears while hearing this.
I'd love to see Josh here instead of John :((
The best 1st song of an album is still "wraped"
Finally!.... 🖤
It's official, Eddie Guerrero lives on thru Anthony.  Mamacita!
What is this song about?
Nostalgia pura! Eu tava com saudades!!! Ansiosaaaa pra ver ao vivo 💘
1M is coming ! keep streaming !
John is back and you hear it almost instantly, the song is incredible. My own criticism is that I don't understand what Anthony is doing vocally bringing in this weird pirate/Irish draw into some of his lyrics, but it's very minor
Sounds awsome! Just ordered the vinyl. Now to try to afford the tour.
PICA!
:)
La primera vez que los escuché fue en un salón de juegos recreativos arcade y en la radio sonaba el git away tendría unos 12 años y desde entonces los sigo tengo muchos bonitos recuerdos en sus temas que han sido banda sonora de mi vida...
No puedo creer que estoy viva para ver y escuchar esto! Gracias! ❤️
this song feels like home ❤️
The way I missed you 4 together!!
mis héroes por siempre
los amo ❤️❤️❤️
Velho! como o antony tá bem demais
Kiedis and me have the same haircut 🤣
Super ✌️☮️😊
Is this a new episode of tiger king?
I was expecting something else... we got much better than I expected
Here at 500K views and feel honored
Nem acredito AINDA :)))))
This fills my heart with so much joy I’ve watched 3 times so far!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fucking solo de Frusciante! RHCP real soung
โอ้ ยอดรักฉันกลับมา  พระเจ้าจอห์น โผคืนสู่รัง
Frodo's ring did not end up in the fires of mount doom.   The RHCP's keep it in a box in their rehearsal space.
👏🏼👏🏼🙂
Quem mais do 🇧🇷 marcando presença nesse momento histórico? JF de volta pela 3a vez! Que venha um disco foda! CHILI PEPPERS BANDA DA MINHA VIDA!
Вы уж простите, но звучит так - будто нейросеть попросили написать самую типичную роцк песню.
that tone, that solo!
La mejor versión de los Red Hot!! Hermoso
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ still the bests in the business, they sound exactly the same but new, fresh at the same time
RHCP Never Old
No tengo nada contra lo nuevo pero a veces hace falta algo de lo clasico. Grandes los Chili Peppers, manteniendo es espiritu del rock clasico.
🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️❤️🌶️
😲😲😲😲❤️❤️ 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Anthony Kiedis : "El paisa"
Gracias a Dios que están juntos!!!❤️ Esto es amor a lo que hacen y todos podemos disfrutarlo, me dan vida 🇵🇪 Los amo 😎Gracias Frusciante por volver!!! 💘Thanks I'm so happy🥺
"Queremos a los chilipeppers!!!!!"
GREAT
Finalmente, o pai do red hot tá de volta 🌶🤟🏻
The verse sounds like a ‘Hobbit’ song when Anthony sings! 💥💥💥💥
Tantos años pensando en suicidarme, especialmente desde la pandemia. La verdad no me arrepiento de seguir en este plano ahora. Y no son lo mismo de antes, son incluso mejores <3
Red Hot Sea Shanty. Love the new single.
John. is. BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dammit I’ve missed him!
This Band never ends!!!
Únicos por siempre !!!!!
O mundo sorri novamente

Will Ferrel is back on RHCP
John ❣❣❣
It’s all about the Zoom backgrounds.
Sumpah sedih & pada masa yg sama terharu juga utk lagu yg baru ini welcome back john 🙏✨
That takes me back to the first time seeing RHCP when I was only 8 yrs old back in 1999, RHCP sounds really awesome,  they never changed,they are  absolutely timeless, Anthony, Flea, Chad, and John, you guys rock forever💯🤘🎤🎵🎸🥁
How I missed you guys!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Let’s fucking go can’t wait to see him in concert this year
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
John has not lost his “Jimi Hendrix” vibe in his guitar playing at all, great stuff fellas, can’t wait for the album to drop.
dava p ser mais criativo, mas eoq tá tendo 👌. .. o rock tá de volta
QUE GUSTO VOLVER A VERLOS JUNTOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SIIIIIIIIIIIII
I didn't know Will Ferrell was in this band
Chad's drum is unique.
That solo was FUZZTASTIC.
Great to see Will Ferrel back on drums again
Yep, nothing changed and I couldn't be happier :)
I actually loved Josh ❤️
I love the comment section here
Good ol chili peppers
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can the Chili Peppers save the world?!?!..... No ,of course not silly rabbit, But it sure feels like they can. Thanks for keeping those instruments plugged in! ✌️
So long as Anthony Kiedis has a six pack, the world will be fine.
John and flea might as well be blood brothers when they link up it’s magic!
You hear John's influence immediately. That guitar sound that's unique from all others. These 4 are meant to be together creating music.  The chili peppers are back! Super excited to hear what else this album brings.  ❤
This truly made me happy!!!
🙅🏾‍♂️😎🇧🇷👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👊🏾..
Hermosa mañana verdad!!
That's the difference that a GREAT guitarist makes in a band. Kind of Stadium Arcadium vibe, but some new nuances too... Looking forward to their new album!
Discovered the meaning of life with this song.  Brazil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I just love you guys
Frusciante's solos just hits different
Thank you John for coming back...  You gave me another reason to live in this world :) Keep it up, much love
Mi verano obscuro terminó gracias a ustedes. Los quiero mucho Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Obrigada RHCP 🎶 🇧🇷🥰 como faz pra curtir 1 milhão de vezes?

Fã desde os 10 anos, agora com 27 aqui pra provar que é a melhor banda dessa vida ❤ Meus amigos, que canção sensacional!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It's great, but a bit too nostalgic. I feel it's just Stadium Arcadium again.
The lineup is back John is back it's so good to see them back with a banger again ❤❤🤘🏻🤘🏻 RHCP
Wouldn't mind some longer solos by John. Let him just shred
Os brabos 🇧🇷🚀
Nítido que foi deixado o frusciante em primeiro plano dessa vez o que é muito bom
Los extrañé ♥️ John te amo ♥️
Meh
Damn Danny Trejo looks better than ever.
❤🌶
Could have been a stadium aecadium song  It feels not bad at all
Que felicidad volver a escucharlos con mi ídolo de vuelta John Frusciante ❤
Volver a escuchar la guitarra de Frusciante es lo mejor de la vida, te hace sentir como si estuvieras flotando. El sonido de estos locos es un orgasmo auditivo
Momento esperado há anos!!! Vida longa RHCP!!
GRACIAS
JOHN SOS EL UNICO Y VERDADER0 AMOR DE MI VIDA
The magic is back! :) Thank you guys!
Impressionante como John Frusciante potencializa o som do red hot!
very pedestrian and familiar for these guys.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....
But it's 2002??😍😍
Que manera de hacerme feliz, grande John, amamos tu regreso y tú frescura   RHCP 🌶️🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Grande Frusciante.
Increible!
I've listened It 3 times already. Every single time the solo starts, I smiled and/or had goosebumps. I'm really grateful for this reunion, and I just can't wait to see them live.
Minha vida voltou a ter sentido
RHCP indonesians🇮🇩
it reminds me my wild love by the doors
Gracias rhcp por esta nueva rola.....
што се мене тиче последњи албум са џошом је бољи од овога...
Ustedes son simplemente ÚNICOS ❤️
I’m crying like a baby
Happy for John's return but the song is Nah
Ну наконец то!
Thank you.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSS
Still got it
Caralho que saudades estava deste rhcp com John, lembra os tempos de 2002.
John doesn’t age
Grande los Red Hot!!! Abrazos desde Necochea, Buenos Aires, Argentina!
Thank you guy's, i can feel the RHCP vibes and I CANT BELIEVE HOW MUCH GOOD IS THIS SONG !!! JOHN  behind the guitar is immediately felt with his inimitable playing.
Isso é Frusciante Caraí 🤧😍. Demorou, mas taí 😭♥️.
Volvió la magia unida por el cosmos
Vamooo Johncito! Un crack
Goosebumps. John the God is home
Solo is alright. Otherwise this sounds like middle aged adult alternative dribble... Oh, and John Oates wants his mustache back.
guauuuu, otra vez como tantas otras se me eriza la piel al escucharlos, larga vida a la música, larga vida a red hot chili peppers!!
Yoooooo, is that Flee in the path's? Intresting did he saw Eren and Ymir?
Frusciante <3
John Frusciante ❤️
Ta bueno
Yeeaaaahhaaaaaaa!!!!!!
si! gracias!!!
Sound like rock songs in hippie era.Psihedelic,amazing.
Go cheetah vibes guys, go cheetah vibes
❤️🌶️
Aaaaaaah! Joooohn <3
John ha vuelto ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Nos sentimos orgullosos de vivir esta historia de los Pepper's, el retorno de John y su guitarra✨, cuánta falta hacías... Gracias Anthony, Flea y Chad por esta alegría y esta música ‼️‼️
Mi hijo me presentó a los Red Hot hace unos años y ahora esperabamos juntos este lanzamiento. Es Genial👍👍👍🇨🇱
Oh it's sooo good to see John back! Also, Anthony nailed it in this song.
No sabes lo que te amo John
Finalmente eles estão de volta
💙💙💙💙💙💙
Me emociono hasta las lágrimas por volver a verlos juntos, por volver a escucharlo y sentir esa emoción inigualable que siempre me han producido. Gracias por volver y gracias por volver con todo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
HOLLY SHIIIIIIT
Ive been born in 2002 and never thought to be seeing Frusciante playing in the Chilis again. Can’t be happier right now. Time to learn this wonderful song!
JDER!!!!! ♥️✨
Yeah🤘 John is back🤘
La mejor Notificación  ♥️
Yeaaaah
That jimmy hendrix feeling with pull-ons pull-offs😍
🥲🥲🥲🥲
That 1999 vibes 🔥
john frusciante is the best
I’m actually very disappointed in this song,it’s like they forgot what makes them
Bring Josh Back!!!1!!1!
Finalmente!!!!
🖤🌶️🦉☮️🎶so good
Alright, good stuff
FINALLY!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Finally!!!! Frusciante's back🤟🤟🤟
¡Estos son los Chili Peppers que amo!
Increíble!!!!
This is  too amazing and surprising
Wait. What? Is this real life?
Omggg  I'm so happy and are they wearing like the same outfits from before
RHCP <3
foooooooooooookin' com'on! :)
It's a good time to be a Chili Peppers' fan...
I must admit that I’m disappointed. Pretty much all of the tracks from Getaway are better than this. Melody is quirky and generally song is pretty medicore
THAT STRAT GOT SOME HISTORY
Simplesmente incrível
Love it welcome back John❤️❤️
Please retire bunch of has beens  still trying to be relevant  so sad
俺には君たちの創る音楽が絶対に必要だ。 ありがとう。日本より愛を込めて。
Aku yang bertambah tua, RHCP tetaplah seperti dulu
最高すぎる😭待ってました！！
It’s so good to see Will Ferrell back on the drums
I've been missing this vibe and sound since Californication. Glad to see John is back, alive and kickin!
Welcome back, Frusciante! BRAZIL!
Que feliz que me hacen estos 4. Gracias por estar de vuelta
Mais de dez anos esperando pra ver esses quatro juntos de novo e agora nem acredito que tá acontecendo!!! Amei demais ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Red Hot Are back!! Frusciante is back!! The world smile again
This is so great, still feels unreal that John is back. I'm really hoping to see some Scandinavian tour dates soon!
Hace 17 años grabé un casette con la canción californication, no el album, la canción que sonaba unas 13 veces ida y vuelta. Estos chabones iniciaron mi locura por la música y con una palabra maravillosa que ni siquiera existia , que engendraba el vicio de tararearla como salga
Flea still amazing as ever!
yyyyyyyeeeeeeeeesssssss   this hit right where It should have. Excellent job gentlemen
Omg 😍
Welcome back, Mr. Frusciante!
Thanks, this is what we needed
RHCP 💪💪💪 SINCE 2006 now im 29 years old 2022🙌😊🙌
O que é isso meus amigos?!! 👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥 John sem dúvida o melhor guitarrista ♥️
❤❤❤
Nem parece que estavam tanto tempo sem lançar. Show!!
Wow.... great to hear a track for these four guys in Ages...the Chemistry they share is insane...this album is gonna kickass
weak single
Ty RHCP!!
Black Summer Lyrics [Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip   [Chorus] Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end  ############################# Enjoy and thank me later. RHCP welcome back. 🥰
Omg! That guitars!
I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, they still got it!  Black Summer is amazing, I love it! John's guitar is iconic, it is the band's signature, in my opinion. So happy and excited to listen to the other tracks.
Это просто охуенно!
Didn't know I was waiting for a new RHCP song until I heard this one. One hell of a tune and glad to be rocking out to RHCP again.
O mais interessante é saber que depois de John Wick 3, ele virou guitarrista de uma banda de rock.
AMOR ILIMITADO♡
Que genios son!💪🏻 RHCP♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oh my. That’s classic Chilli’s …
What a living legends.. it gives me goosebumps seeing them rocking together again  ❤️‍🔥 Thank you John for comeback
I just came here to say I love John Frusciante.
Came here for stellar Frusciante guitar work. I wasn't disappointed...
2:48 ANTHONY ZYZZ POSE? ;O
I wasn't too sure on the vocals at first, but this is a jam. Hooked for this new album. Everybody's as good as they ever were.
I love how all these comments are of different languages, amazing how this band can unite people from all over this world and have something in common

Gorgeous indeed, you guys definitely have something you can only achieve when the four of you are together. Hope to finally be able to see you live this time around.
I really hope AK doesn't do 'that voice' live.
FRUSCIANTE IS GOD.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
John is back
Amo demais ❤️🌶 🇧🇷
Can i get a "Hooooyaaah!" for Antony's barber? Bro's got wilder haircut then in his teenage years!
Vos estas llorandooo ... Yo nooo ... *rompen en llanto* la esperaaaaa se acabo 🙌🙌🙌🙌
wow this is so surreal guys!
Nem acredito que tô vivo ora ver isso. Obrigado RHCP
500K views and only 100K likes......... ?! Hey Wake Up! That"s pure Red Hot!!! 😝
*AMO ESTE NUEVO CHILI PEPPERS!*
90's vibes never failed
yooooo
*LEGENDS*   Still doing masterpieces
Pure love! <3
Em meio a tanto caos (social e musical), o ROCK respira!!!
Letsssss Gooooooo 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Boring, safe, predictable. Disappointing
THE BEST OF THE BEST 🔥
Kiedis dab at  2:11!    I am returning to my prime with this magikal mix of souls reunited  ⚡️.   Who else, headed into their upper crusty years,  has Kiedis fitness goals?     Black Summer is certainly a song I think we can all relate to collectively during these pandemic years,  global warming and crisis after crisis and, as I am all too sure, many of us relate to personally as well, love and loss, the exponential heavy weight it all can have on us, especially in dark times.   So excited for this next era of RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!  GOOD TIME BOYS ARE BACK!  ALL WAYS MY BAND …..🌶❤️‍🔥
La wea buena!! 🤘
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Good song, but it doesnt sounds like Stadium Arcadium. It could be on The Getaway.
Frusciante <3 <3 <3 <3
It’s amazing, I can’t wait for the rest of the album. This will be on repeat all day!
Por isso amo essa banda  Desde os anos 90 com a mesma essência Simplesmente uma  perfeição 🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Intactos! Era lo que necesitábamos, piel de gallina ♥️
I don't like it.
Ôba, até que enfim música fresquinha dos Peppers! 👏🏻🤝🏻👍🏻💗🥰🤩🇧🇷💓
1M LET'S GOOOOO!!!! RED HOT DESERVES MORE!!!!
Al fin!!!! Como amo esta banda lptmr
Eu amo vocês demais
Os melhores q temos 🙌🔴🔥🥣🌶🎸 vcs sempre fazem mais do q nós esperamos!!!
Simplesmente a melhor banda do mundo voltou ❤
3:34 oops……Chad, there were no cymbal crashes there lol
I don't know why but this song reminds me of,,House of the rising sun''.Gooo Frusciante !!! 💥🎶👊🎶👊🎶💥🎶⚡
How'd they get Will Ferrell on drums?
Honestly, at first I hesitated with this song, but now with the video, it is just fucking awesome
MEEEEU DEUS Que som foda!  Frusciante é um monstro. Massa demais ver ele de volta.
Somehow it reminds me the melodic songs of By The Way album... Something like Midnight... Amazing.
😊
what a time to be alive
Magic new song
Los Red hot chili peppers han vuelto.…  LET`S ROCK MOTHERFUCKRS !!! 🔥🤘🔥
He's back
O rock morreu? E essa maravilha aqui é o que então? Ah, vai tomar banho! Amazing
John frusciante is back with the new song,, good job RHCP
Meh
Some stadium arcadium vibe right here
How does Chad not get bored of playing the same beat for every song, over and over and over and over?! He is the least imaginative drummer of all time. Sorry! Someone has to say it!
❤️❤️❤️🌶️🌶️🌶️❤️❤️❤️
Oh goodie!! I sure hope its yet another mundane song all about California.
Nice🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
VOCÊS SÃO PERFEITOOSSSSS
QUE MÚSICA 💙💙💙
That guitar lick... It's so much John....
Uma das bandas que compuseram a trilha sonora da minha vida!!! Muito feliz por estarem de volta com a formação clássica.
When you in Montreal next?
I am not à fan because I thought he sing always the same meiody , but here it s différent I like the song and I hope more of the guitarist
Que lindo verlo tocar de nuevo a Frusciante...😍😍
Welcome back, RHCP! May you becoming summer be light and bright!
Bem-vindo de volta, John. É um grande prazer vê-los reunidos novamente. Vida longa aos Peppers. ❤️ Brazil 🇧🇷 ❤️
THEY ARE BACK!!! 😍😍😍😍 WHAT AN AMAZING TIME TO BE A RHCP FAN! 🥰 JOHN ❤️❤️
SIMPLESMENTE JOHN FRUSCIANTE
Espectacular canción!! Este es el verdadero sonido de los Red!! Que gran regreso!! Grandes Peppers!!
ILOVE YOU SO MUCH GUYS
Rock on Peppers!!! Been a die-hard fan for as long as i can remember. And now that my guitar idol John is back with the band, its like a dream come true! Pre-ordered the limited edition vinyl album with the Lakers colors as well! Cant believe this is actually happening! WE LOVE YOU RHCP!!
Som bom. Mas não achei na pegada Stadium Arcadium como disse Rick Rubin. Essa música poderia muito bem estar no The Getaway
🪶🙏😎 thank you ❤️ you're doing, lol this helps the "waiting"🦄
It's been a long time ❣️
Vamaa Antonio y los picantes!!! ✨🇦🇷 10/10
Gracias por RHCP gracias por Frusciante
Red Hot chili Peppers Live at Tattooine - buy your tickets
<3
Anthony's lyrics are... even more abstract than usual.
I'm so happy that Frusciante is back! 30+ years and they still rockin' it!. RHCP 4 ever!!!!!
Show 👌

You NEVER let me down, RHCP. Never!!
¡Ahora siii! ♪♫
BR Vive a essência dos Peppers 🤘🏾  🇧🇷
Definitelly better that previous two albums first singles and also I would dare to say a more age-appropriate (in respect to the band approaching their 60s).
Frusciante's soul speaking again
🔥
They're back.❤
CTM ESTOY LLORANDO 😭 AHORA VENGAN A CHILE VIEJOS TALENTOSOS
Welcome home John
La grande classe comme d habitude....30 ans après ils sont toujours présents  je salue leurs charisme...il me berce depuis mes 12 ans  j en ai 45....grand respect au quatre

Ako ay lubhang nagagalak sa bagong awitin ng Red Hot Chili Peppers. Nais ko sana ay makapunta ulit kayo dito sa aming bansang Pilipinas. Ipagpatuloy nyo ang paglikha ng inyong sining. Pagpalain kayo. 🇵🇭🤘
THANK YOU RHCP 😍😍😍😍😍
Escuché una canción de "Red Hot Chili Peppers" con mi novia por primera vez en años. ¡¡¡Este amor!!!
After so many years..... the best Sound ever
Viva o meu Red Hot Chili Peppers ! ❤🔥🌶🤩😍🥺😭🤘🙏🙌👏
Just amazing! Can't wait for the entire album to be out!
han elevado su alma, han dejado atrás el rollo loco pepper,ahora son mas sabios y su energía es increíble
Seeing this upload instantly made my day much better, now I'm going to listen to it and forget about the world for a second. PEACE!
Acordar com um bom dia desse 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
LETS F-ING GO
Ich liebe diesen Sound und die Riffs von John...... Willkommen zurück John...
Sensacional! Tava esperandooo há muito tempo.
It's amazing how big difference to their songs Frusciante makes! I think they are on good way and hope to hear more from new stuff soon!
John Frusciante 🎸🤘🔥🌶️
Well, at least the music is good....
Vocês perceberam que o Anthony tá parecendo o Tiringa? 😂😂😂😂
A energia que eles transmitem é muito boa🥰ouvir as músicas  sempre me trás alegria,Amo Red Hot Chili Peppers 🥰❤️💞
Opaaaaaa demorou mas chegou, e como sempre vale a espera!!!
yo i think rock is coming back this wack hip hop thats been coming out  has actuall did something for us  thank you guys RHCP
You are a Sinner. Plain and Simple. You have committed adultery and murder in your Heart and you notoriously lie.  This is Human Nature in the wilderness !  REPENT ! You still can be forgiven while you live ! Jesus Christ has made us a offer 2000 years ago. I recommend wholeheartedly to consider this offer and wash yourself clean, with eternal holy garment on the body of your soul.   The Spirit counts ! The Flesh is useless !  Come , Make that CHANGE ! .
Californication days are back, agora vai!!!!
Els més grans han tornat. No puc expressar l'energia que em donen! They are back!!
essência pura do red hot essa música, inacreditável de boa!
Sensacional! O DNA Chilli Peppers nunca perde a essência, som fora de sério!!! #OFilhoBomACasaTorna #JF 🌶️🇧🇷
Antonio y los más picantes. Épico.
Esperando este momento durante tantos años lpm, herede la banda de mi viejo, que alegría lpm verlos juntos.
0:49-0:55 - You can tell the influence Jimi Hendrix had on John Frusciante...
I don't think there is anything more authentic then flea playing bass on AK's shoulders. I smiled wide when I saw that haha. I'm so excited for the album!
I'VE BEEN WAITING.. Thanks John, now you guys are whole again. This connection... <3
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Amazing
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Since Fight Like a Brave! Been jamming since my sophmore yr in high-school! Im 50 now! Incredible!
BRASIIIIIILL  - 🇧🇷😏
I've been waiting too. Cannot put in words how much the new music means to me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥                There back 🔥🥶🥶🥶🔥🥶🔥🔥🥶🥶🔥🥶🔥
Por fin algo de buena música despues de tanto reggaeton y trap!
Love you guys so much 🥺. Thank you for this song!
FANTASTICATION
Of course I love it…. 🤘🙂🤘
FRUSCIANTE IS THE SOUL ❤️
Excellent. RHCP comme on les aime. Le retour de Frusciante se fait clairement sentir . Trop hâte de les voir en Juillet au Stade de France à Paris !!
Finally The RHCP with guitar God Frusciante, simply amazing.
Its not the same but respect guys I wish to have same as you life inside my self
Chingones!
I was waiting for the shirt to come off ;)
So cool this came out on my bday! RHCP ROCKS!!!!
Amor
Welcome back John! We Love You ❤️
Weak. Wouldn't have got on Stadium Arcadium, and that had 28 tracks
Album release date?
What amazes me is the fact that everybody seems to hold them to the pinnacle still when they have been sucking so hard and consistently for 20 years and recycling the same tired old cliches. I mean kudos to them, their business is flourishing as ever but the fact that they can’t even hear that their music is atrociously bland might be proof that their ears need retirement and ours need relief.
Qué felicidad volver a escucharlos!!! Gracias!!!!
RHCP ❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍, que fodaaaa. Os melhores, amo vocês ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
🙏✨🥁
So glad to see Will Ferrell is still with the band.
Red hot chilli peppers 🤘🏼🤘🏼❤💣💥💥🇧🇷
Nossos californianos
Weak. Wouldn't have got on Stadium Arcadium, and that had 28 tracks
Primeira vez que escutei RHCP tinha em torno de 7 anos e de cara se tornou minha banda preferida... hoje com 30 anos nada mudou. Se fizessem um filme de minha vida, com certeza RHCP seria a trilha sonora. rs
Esta parte de mi vida la llamo felicidad, thank you Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!
I miss Josh.
Oh how I'm looking forward to their summer EU tour. <3 BTW something in this song gives me U2 vibes.
🤩😃
i ❤️ u chili Peppers! From Brazil 🇧🇷
"After ten years on the josh coast, it was time to go home."
Simplemente Gracias Chili Peppers! ❤️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
If a new RHCP song comes out,thats when you know the world will be turns a better place!! ❤✌
Absolutely amazing song! I recognize John guitar mix after…2 seconds :) Such a perfect reunion!
nothing against josh but when they play with john is like something else. the chemistry is incredible. i hope john stay in the band this time.
Increible
I've got the best birthday present ever from the ones who don't even know I exsist.
Never bet against Red Hot... they never make mistakes, they never get old *.*
How does Kiedis still have a body like that at 60 yrs old??????
john frusciante nao envelhece,cara tem a mesma energia de quando era jovem.
YES YES YES I cant believe my ears, its sooooo good!!!!!
arrepiou até os cabelo do cu
musica linda
Best band in universe!
Amazing song , the chorus  is so good !! This is ReD Hot.
A essência do RHCP de volta, estava com saudades deste solo guitar e baixo !!!!??
레드핫 음악은 언제들어도 좋다. 그만큼 세련되었고 시대를 앞선, 문화와 장르들의 창의적 집합이다. 샐러드 보울과 닮아있는. 환갑 넘은 할배들이지만 현역처럼 느껴지는 이유다.
Oh yeah! Venham pra Brasil, por favor!
КАИИИИФФФФ ВЕЛИЧАЙШИЙ КАМБЕК !
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time…
Descanza en Paz Diego Verdaguer🤘🏻
SIIIIIIIII JODER !!!!!! 😱🥲😍🤘🏻😎❤️

That's it... I remember when I first listened to them! What is your name? Love at first sight, huh!? Back in '99 when my Mom introduced me to Californication. Man, how awesome! What love for this amazing band! And now, Twelve years later, the pleasure of listening to Frusciante with all his mastery and perfection. Thank God \0/ #BlackSummer #UnlimitedLove #RedHot forever. \0/
Se me caen lágrimas de emoción. Toda una vida escuchándolos y volvieron para salvar un pedacito de mi .
So glad John's back. For me his signature sound IS the RHCP sound.
Temón

Es emocionante escuchar este tema, por dios que ARTE. No dejo de escucharlo

I can't stop crying! I'm glad that I'm fan of their music. It's always bringing me back to live!
Absolutely amazing!
BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
So californication`s era sound)
Awesome John is back…
🔥
They are back like they never left!
Thank you. Thank you for being. <3
最高
RHCP COMPLETO NOVAMENTEEEEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAA AMO DEMAISSSSS
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Eles voltaram! RHCP ❤
This feels more like an album cut than the first single....maybe it's just me...🤷‍♂️
Como é bom acordar e de repente o YouTube te recomendar uma nova dos Chili Peppers.  Bom dia pra quem é de bom dia. ☀️
Esto es real?? 🤩😱
Long live to the Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤️
John frusciante ❤❤❤❤
@3:09 is when John finds the groove 🎶🎸🎶
Gracias por segui existiendo ❤
I am in (unlimited) love with this song
The greatest band of all time finally BACK! 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🔥🔥🔥🔥
The first part of the melody sounds like a Scottish tune in the way he sings it... Interesting
Que bueno ver que los red hot no perdieron su impronta!! Espectacular 😎
It's basically a Californication demo. The guitar playing is absolutely ace but I don't see how I can be excited for this new record if this is the best song on it.
Old shirtless white men. How Dare You  ✊🏿
I’ve been waiting, I’ve been waiting, wainting for that new album 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Empezando el día de la mejor manera!
Jesus is coming!
I came here to hear John again...
Never heard before this Jimmy Hendrix guitar riff.
OMG! Frusciante is back, that guitar playing and those backing vocals are fkn Gold! I Love you guys, looking foward to the New album!🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Great band. This song is not too shabby.
Magistral de vuelta una de las mejores y titánicas bandas con un producto nuevo 🤟🏽🇨🇴
*_-*-_*_- God 10 de 10 y basado --__*-_
F@@king brilliant, love it. Can’t wait to see them live in Glasgow ❤️
I am about their age and is it just me or isn’t it kind of embarrassing to still be lip-synching and taking your shirt off and dancing to a background track I don’t know it seems shameless
Thought John’s solos would’ve improved by now lol
PEPPERS! 🌶️🇵🇭
DE ARREPIAR!! obrigado rhcp
#rhcp 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Sounds great
Increíble
SUPER COOL
Top demais... quando será quem vem para o Brasil novamente hein? Um grande abraço, Josemar de Paranapanema SP Brasil....
Pretty amazing 👏 ❤
Chad better play the guitar than Frusciante.
나 취해떠
I've listened to this on repeat for an hour
I can’t describe how much happy I am that John is back
It's good to see Will Farel playing drums again
Uma viagem no tempo... Que saudades ❤️
Love it!
I actually prefer josh, and I don't see all the fuzz about John. They are both equally great, and I prefer joshs style and personality.
Que gran sensación la de verlos juntos de nuevo, lo que parecía difícil sucedió…a disfrutarlo…!!!! Los años pasan pero su sonido es inconfundible.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
THE BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER!!!!!!
Love it 👌
Brabissimo como sempre
Frusciante ♥️
The guitarist looks like Trickfinger
gonna try this on my drumkit tomorrow!❤️‍🔥
🤘🤘
Amazing 😍
Vida longa aos peppers música show
Obg Deusss
Absolut fantastic. Please come the Austria
LETS GOOOOOO!!!
It was really great and nice to see that you guys started making new songs again, awesome works on guitar by John and Flea, and the vocals were full of passion, Chad's drums was awesome as always and the changes in chorus parts were really amazing loved it. \mm/
Great to hear them with new beautiful music ! RHCP You made ma day !  Btw Anthony looks like samurai
QUE HOMENS!
Stadium Arcadium in 2022
The King is back 🌶
Hearing this song made me cry tears of joy!
Ты глянь , кто это Ептать ...вернулся
I think I wanna cry. I’ve heard all their albums, and now I can listen more music  from my favorite band. Este día es fantástico.
Man is it just me i feel emotional listening to this
Aguante los rhcp papá
So happy to see John Frusciante back in RHCP!
so good to hear john's solo's again, and his vocals. I'm not to sure about anthony's haircut (is he going for lumberjack/communist leader look) either way the chili peppers are back baby!
John guitar playing always takes me to another space and time!!! 💕
RHCP é a prova viva que ainda é possível de se fazer música boa com qualidade.
"I been waiting I been waiting Waiting..."  for this!  * Thanks, Anthony, Flea, Chad and Jonh. *
Sejam bem-vindos  novamente!!!!!! Obrigado por tudo RHCP
so long
🥵🥵🥵🥵
i  love it !!!!
How we have missed John
HEIY,  YOO..
Love it!
The monsters is back
Not bad but there no faith no more!
Let’s gooooo
These guys are gonna save 2022
Fckin living legends!
The 70's bad cop/pedophile look is not hip.  Also, when did Will Ferrel join the band?  :-)
ジョンのギターがまた聴けるとは！泣ける！
chorando.
OMG same RHCP vibes, amazing!!
Omggg godfrusciante
Beautiful
🔥🔥🔥awesome!!!
Seria bom se eles lançasse a faixa "Californication demo" que tem pegada reggae grunge que é a versão alternativa de Californication.
HOT‼️
❣️🇧🇷
Los muchachos están de vuelta 🤘
Love it. Same formula. Still skeptical though. Being hurt twice is enough already
I like john, but miss josh =/
I like this one.... and I am more a 87 - 91 RHCP fan
A Beginning of another legendary musical journey. I'm so glad to witness it!
are we all just collectively gonna die?? i mean I'm definitly going to when I'm going to see them in concert!!!! Can't waitttt also johhnn i'm crying
HOT DAMN Johns playing gave me major goosebumps. Just legendary
Que dia maravilhoso, começar a sexta com lançamento e volta do John pra banda.
🔥
❤️
👌
What's with the Irish folk singer accent?
White mountain Black Countryside
John motherfckin' Frusciante
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!!!!   BRAZIL LOVES U GUYS!
FRUSCIANTE!!!!! OH HOW I MISSED HIM!!!!!
Vaya temazo!! Suena muy fresco.. red hot tienen el don de  no hacer envejecer a sus canciones pues claramente todos sus temas pasan la prueba del tiempo e inspiran a los q ya vamos cerca del medio cupon y a  los q no... a seguir creando y soñando con la dicha de seguir y perseverar ante las prueba... es mi grupo favorito junto con pearl jam!!
Gracia malditos dioses tatuados, son lo mejor de este año ❤️❤️❤️
A música ficou boa, porém achei muito parecida com algumas músicas do Stadium Arcadium, o John da uma nova alma para a banda.
that's amazing
Thanks!!!
Im glad to live at the same time of rhcp
Sounding awesome can't wait for summer to see them again
HELL YEAH
Muy bueno
0 dislikes. Not even bots dare.
O som ficou demais na pegada crua das guitarras e o vocal aberto do Antony. Flea e o batera demais cara.
Deep lyrics lol
Un regreso muy esperado...
Sinta a essência da banda, i love red hot chili peppers!😍🇧🇷
Siiii !!! Hoy es un gran dia!! Ellos volvieron 🌶😍🌶
Finally!!!
This sounds like an outtake from Stadium Arcadium era. I enjoyed the solo for obvious reasons...but doesn't quite have the power I'd expected. Hopefully better tracks to come!
El sexo ha vuelto a nacer 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀❤️
Oh yeeeeeeeah
Naaaa this is a B-sides!!!  I don’t believe that this song is a open single 😰
รอเสมอ จาก ไทยแลนด์ครับ 🇹🇭
Retorno do John Frusciante foi a pérola da fase rock 90 do RHCP. Super curioso pra ouvir o novo álbum. Desde os anos 90, ouço e acompanho a banda. O solo do John foi demais. Love Brazil RHCP.
"I've been waiting, I've been waiting" It sounds a lot like US, waiting for this song 🤣😜👌
I love you guys ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I missed you guys so much, I'm so glad you're all back and with some good stuff, amazing stuff coming out! Love you always and forever!
John motha fucking frusciante!
🔥❤️
Os monstros voltaram!!!
I'm glad they're keeping the tradition of shirtless Anthony alive
Thanks God!!!
I think this song is stadium arcadium b-side
❤️🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻
daaaamn!
o ano vai ser bom.  olha issooooo, nem acredito🥺  nunca perdem a essência❤🌶🌶
🥳🥳🔥🔥🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Som top!!! Venham fazer uma turnê aqui, Brazil 🇧🇷
fuck.. remember being 11/12 and seeing Under the Bridge on MTV, then 19/20 and singalong Scar Tissue,  cheering the come back of John on Californication, now I'm 42 and here they are again, in such a good form, this is a pure bless. thank you RHCP! I love you!
Любимые! 🧡
Meh
Desde que comecei ser fã do RHCP em 2019 e via os Shows, já havia me dado um vontade de ver a energia da Banda com o John novamente. É outra sonoridade, encaixa perfeitamente, a conexão desses 4 juntos é incrível... 🔥❤️
Always loved Frusciante’s guitar work . Glad He’s back
👎🏼
Let's gooooooo
Excelente música esse álbum vai ser de muita qualidade musical 🤘🎸👏
Yeeeeeees
Like there were no last 15 years❤
I love you 💖💖💖
felicidade tem nome e sobrenome, obrigada red hot
Ele disse cantando o que eu quero falar🔥...🙆🔫           (😷)
We're bit lucky having this album, AND Pluralone's This Is The Show aren't we?
hope they last...
aaaaaaaah! toooop!
That mullet hair is awful.
Amazing, Anthony is wearing shirt longer than minute xD
RHCP PRA SEMPRE SERÁ A MELHOR BANDA DO MUNDO!
Oh wow. Great song.
THIS IS REALLLYYYY GOING ONNNN.
for me it sounds like all previous songs, nothing specific
More please?!
Solamente quiero decir: GRACIAS JOHN! 🔥🤘🏻
first bar and u know John Frusciante is here
Yes yes yes  Thank you so much
사랑합니다...🔥
Wooow
Nice song, but i hope they will play Dark Necessities live. or any song from the Getaway.
Omg this so red hot 🌶🌶
I can't believe it!! After years and you guys are still the best, thank u🌶️
You just knew Chad would come in with a little snare roll.
It would seem that only recently Justin Long graduated from high school and founded his college, and now he is already receiving a pension for a couple with Will Farrell trying to get a girlfriend in Roxberry.
SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS
This is the Year ❤️🔥
Melhor banda do mundo! Eu amo vocês! Que Vibe ❤️🏄🏼‍♂️🌊
It's good to have john back, sure, but this song is completely irrelevant.
Them boys are back! Long live RHCP!
LINDOOOOOS
Don't Look Up    la lal llaaaa laaaa laallaaaa
they are back!!!!!!!!!!!
Who is the Irish guy singing the verses? 😉  [joking]
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✳️✳️✳️
Here it is, the thing we've been waiting for : 0:43 - 0:55
BOP
É us guri
ABSOLUTE BANGER
Джон Фрушчанте вернулся к перцам? Ого...
Will Ferrell is such a good drummer!!
CACETE COMO É BOM ACORDAR FÃ DO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
Childhood love
Como é que se diz mesmo ?... Sem palavras... Feliz de mais !!
😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎
Os cara mitando sempre..... tooop de mais.....o ritmo deles parece q nunca desatualiza kkkk
Obrigado Red Hot, música muito dançante, Kiedls cantando como nunca, todos da banda incríveis 🤘🏻🇧🇷🇵🇹🤘🏻
people are saying they kept their essence intact but this literally sounds nothing like any rhcp song i've ever heard since when did anthony kiedis start using the hard "errrr" instead of an "uhh" sound imagine if he said "califorrrrnication" instead of "califoonication"
Te amo John Frusciante
Muito brabo
I’m crying I’m so happy I’m crying
oof dat solo, john's back baby!
Eu: só acredito vendo... Eu vendo: Ladies and Changeman!! John Motherfucker Fruscianteeeeee
Are back😍😍😍🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥
Where did this come from?!
much love
es impresionante como algo así pueda generar tantas emociones, sobre todo nostalgia, me siento afortunado de oírlos otra vez, como desearía poder escuchar este tema con mi viejo, el me contagió el amor por esta banda, hace 3 meses que falleció, pero lo recuerdo todos los días con un tema de los red hot, son lo mejor❤
込み上げるものがあります。おかえり
Bentornato John <3
Always phenomenal to see this band play especially with john
FUDEU ELES VOLTARAM
Obrigado Josh, você representou! Mas deixa o mestre brilhar. Essa sonoridade na guitarra e esse back vocal, só Jonh tem! 🎸🤘
Pretty crazy how they dropped this a week after you passed. I know you would of loved this song dad
incredible, magnificent, beautiful they left me very amazed, the chili peppers are my life and it is beautiful to see John Frusciante play in his style The best of life and great song
COMO EU SENTI FALTA DESSA GUITARRA
Beautiful...just beautiful ❤️ peace ✌️
Ya están sin ideas. Prescindible. Intrascendente.
John out here looking like Keanu. If he had a suit I woulda thought this was the trailer to the new John Wick flick, John Lick
Just realized I spent the whole song with my jaw dropped
get the message on Flea's fists
The song is awasome. But the production is Rick rubín isn't it? Ya know...
Fucking Legends
待ってました！！ 好きだ！！
John Frusciante!!!
only one word can describe it, amazing, wonderful, I can't even describe how happy I was😍😭❤
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Essa é a melhor banda do mundo!!! 💚🤘🏼
<3 u are legendary
This is fucking great
Wow, es hermosooo
❤️❤️❤️
Welcome home, Johnny.
I want to look like Anthony Kiedis  at age 59 too
lets go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nasıl özlemişim ilaç gibi geldi
It’s one of the best things that happened during the bloody pandemic
CARAAAAAAAAAALHO
this is amazing! can't wait for more songs!
Dou!
Já nasceu como um clássico
Minha banda voltou ❤️
que musica ruim   Amei !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
feels good to be alive! nice performance rhchp! And John Frusciante is BACK how nice is this!
So guitar forward.  Reminds me of Inside of Emptiness
Tô vendo que esse álbum vai ser sensacional 👌
I’m glad they are doing what they enjoy - but …. This song is terrible!  And when did tiger king start singing for RHCP?
Bueno, me gusta. La guitarra suena como la de los discos solistas de Frusciante.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶🌶🌶🌶
Not a meaningful comment but I just want to say how much I love them and how thankful I am for all the precious things they’ve contributed to my life.  Unlimited Love to all of you! 🌶🖤
So good!!!
That's why high expectations are always a problem
Nothing new here, just retire already...
The more I listen to it, the better it gets! This album will be a masterpiece.
I've been waiting too, here comes the suns coronal mass ejection (micronova), to start it all over again.  Black sun will shed its skin, we'll start again.
Is that ben stiller with a beard?
Genial!!!
Que buena forma de arrancar el viernes! RHCP forever! ❤️
John's solo sounds HUGE ! I'm glad Chili Peppers are back at it and with a GREAT sound ! Peace and LOVE, dear Chilis.
Frusciante 🔥
SEM PALAVRASSS!!!!!! NÓS AMAMOS VOCÊS, É ISSO! <3
Indeed
Te amo Frunsciante, los amo rhcp hacen mi vida más hermosa
Still same vibe and same energy.....RHCP .... ❤️
😭😭😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
John🥰😍♥️💖❤️
This is simply amazing! ❤️ Welcome back, John! 🔥
Latino Heat! Latino Heat!
Peace and love ✌🏼❤️ Peace and love!
Man, I am so happy that Frusciante is back. Having him play the guitars for the Peppers is just so magical!
Fake. He didnt say california.

LA CONCHA DE LA LORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASWA
🤘
So happy to get new chili’s music!!!!!
like a dream
I Pre-ordered the album before I heard the song I'm so glad I did.... Killer track, even if Anthony  pronounced a few words very oddly 🤣🤣
He’s back baby, long live the Froosh!
Frusciante.... legit makes this band
LLEGÓ AAAAAAA
Welcome back John... 🥳🤠🥳🥰
I firmly believe that that's just how Flea turned up that particular day.
Damn now I want a mullet 🤘🏻
LOS AMO GRACIAS POR EXISTIR
M A N T A B
not bad. its got that old school sound
lindo demais. os maiores dos maiores 🇧🇷🌶🔥 AMO VOCES PORRA
My comment will probably get lost but whoever reads this.. You got this! Whatever you are going through will get better hang in there ✨❤️
"O primeiro novo álbum do RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS com o guitarrista John Frusciante desde "Stadium Arcadium" de 2006 foi mais uma vez produzido por Rick Rubin , que trabalhou anteriormente em "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" (1991), "Californication" (1999), "By The Way" (2002) e o já mencionado "Stadium Arcadium" ."  Simplesmente épico! Meu 2022 com cara de RHCP!
All My Love, John, Chad, Flea & Anthony.
Que energia linda, Toninho cantando com alegria nos olhos ,essa banda é maravilhosa.
👍🤜🤛🔥
i've been waiting!
you are best!!! 😃
Anthony is looking like Eddie Guerrero 😮 great song
💗💗💗💗
Welcome Back, John! I have goosebumps! The Band of Brothers is REUNITED!
Love it! John coming back is one of the best things ever! ❤️‍🔥
I'm gonna go ahead and say it. I'm a huge fan of RHCP and Frusciante. But. I'm worried this is the lead single off a double album. Maybe I'm just nervous in hope that the new album will be good, but for me at least, this doesn't quite grab you like their previous lead singles. It's more like one of their old b sides. And not even a fortune faded or a quixoticelixir.  To me it actually sounds like a frusciante solo track and its missing that flea / chad groove. Maybe it's a grower ...
Sounds like stadium arcadium from 2005
john you're back
I cried… SOOOOO glad they’re all back together! Absolutely epic hearing John back in the mix, missed you! Beautiful stuff!
Simplesmente um novo solo do John Frusciante anos depois
Após todos esses anos, ainda estou aqui poraaaaaa, amo essa banda ❤
This is like the end of a movie that is just about their carrier  Just think of their first music videos and now this...
Fuck yeah,Frusciante's playstyle's backk
No estoy llorando, se me metió un Frusciante en el ojo 😭
Fã desde os 11 anos (hoje com 30) e depois de todos é evidente o quanto o John Frusciante harmoniza a banda! <3
KINGS
Шикарно 🔥🤘🏻👿🤘🏻🔥Awesome RHCP
Californication vibes ☀️😎
Just crying at the beginning of Jhon's solo
Boys are back in town!
:') They made it, that son of a bitch made it  ♥️🌶️
TE AMO FRUSCIANTE, ENTENDA ISSO ❤️
Beautiful
АХРЕНЕННО
I am chilipeppers indonesia ... Ieu aden fans abah ti indonesia 🔥😭
Red Hot is back, amazing, i from of Brasil
Los amo chicos 🖤 Sacaron un tema que pasará a la historia
Papi John uwu
Conocí a la banda por un persona re fanática, ahora los escucho y es extraño hacerlo sola.
conheci o red hot com meus 6/7 anos e vivi pra ver o John voltando e fazendo um lançamento com a banda! que momento pra estar vivo!!
Precisely at the moment I yearned to witness anthony keidis perform, alas, he hath answered my soul's beckoning.
Que os próximo 10 anos de frusciante na banda seja mágicos 🇧🇷♥️
thx rhcp for saving music and rnr 🙏
holy shit
THAT JOHN BACKINVOCALS!!!!!! 😫😫🤩🤩💗💗
Cazzo che bella!!
With all due respect I think this is mediocre...
this is poetry!!!!!
Frusciante improves just about anything.
Waited and hoped for years for this day, a new red hot chile peppers song with john 👌🤟 really is a dream come true and cant wait to see them in the summer 🤩
Watching from Nepal 🇳🇵🤟👌
I love you, guys 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🙏
Cara é muito bom ver o John de volta,agora sim🤘
Красавчики!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🌶🌶🌶🌶🇮🇩
amazing song a mix of a fruit sallad of californication, by the way and stadium arcadium.... Beatiful song!
Viva México! Vivan los Red Hot Chili Peppers!!! La mejor banda del mundo!
🔥🖤
Awsome!!!!
0:24 “How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?”
JOHNY!!!!!!!!!
OMG I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE THEM LIVE AT BUDAPEST THIS WILL BE BANGER
❤❤❤
The house of the rising sun plus lack of inspiration.
Today is my birthday, I couldn't wish for anything better! Thank you RHCP - your eternal fan!
Larga vida a los red hot ❤️
Spanish speaking people love RHCP.
HOLY SHIT
Mantap👍
Man, whoever mixed these vocals did an absolutely terrible job. I know Anthony isn't an amazing singer but the pitch correction on his vox sounds awful. It's a shame because the rest of the track is great.
AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AMOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK BABY LET'S GO
This is horrible!
WELCOME BACK, GUITAR JESUS FRUSCIANTE
Gave it a shot thinking it would be crap. Wow i was way off! Well done old dudes 👍👍
Anthony is slowly reaching towards his final form: Joe Exotic.
Pqp,john está de volta!!!não via a hora de ouvi-los e velos juntos novamente!!!!que som foda!!!
Masterpiece as allways
FINALMENTE CAZZO, ADESSO SI CHE SONO TORNATI I VERI RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.
Frusciante is God
Esperei tanto por esse momento e ele veioooo. Vcs são fodaaaa!!! ❤️🌶️🇧🇷 Uma pena não ter show no BR 😔
Dark Necessities was a better single but let’s wait for the album.
Vivir en la misma epoca que estos genios es increible… y poder verlos volver es aún mejor
Wow... What a performance. I thought the Red Hot Chili Peppers would never be the same again, boy was i mistaken. Absolutely incredible and nostalgic! Brings me straight back to the good old days.
Oh boy, los chiles están de vuelta baby!
Great to see the boys back together and finally releasing music after so many years. It’s incredible and I can’t wait for the album
Unbelievable
Ouch
Thank you Thank you Thank you John is a Golden God
Loving it. John's riff and solo/bridge part were awesome. Chad, awesome as ever too
Well that was satisfying. Very satisfying.
EU AMO VOCÊS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WELCOME BACK ❤️
Finalmente carai!!!!
Bro it's lame af
São tantos sentimentos, thanks for everything red hot 💗🥺
Can't wait to listen this in a live concert, this Is the kind of solos Will be magic in flea and john hands
Massive Chillies fan, that started off shit, got a bit better by the end, but faark average overall...At least they are going the same route as every other legend band (except Janes) and putting out crap now they are clean and aged. RIP RHCP.
Simple and aesthetically pleasing MV. music - holy jesus mother of god
I’ll cry 🥲
lets go man, life is great !
OMG yeeeeesss !! xD welcome back John, I've missed your solos <3 Love you guys !!!
🌞🖤
The boys are back.
When a Chili Peppers song sounds like you're driving on a highway towards a California sunset, YOU KNOW IT'S A BANGER. Glad to have you back John, what a return mates
My band favorite 😍 💕 From indonesia
respect! sounds quite good, kids!
🤘🏻🇧🇷
That `tache just gets worse and worse ffs
the best thing that ever happened this year already
I think we're getting old 🌶️
Isso é bom demais 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

OMGGGGGGG
Since Stadium Arcadium I was waiting for this thank you Jhon for being a Chili again, thank you guys for this album thank you life for give me this chance
Been listening to them for over 20 years now or since I'm a kid. And that's probably their best song period or at least as good as under the bridge.
😭😭❤️❤️🔥🔥
Unbelievable
É incrível como eles manteram a química q a banda sempre teve ! Vai fazer muito sucesso com certeza !!
응애 너무 좋아서 정신나갈것같애
They're never disappointing
最高すぎる！やった！！
Fodaa

A boa e velha sonoridade clássica dos RHCP, suave e apimentado. Obrigado Peppers!!!
Musicao foda demais !!!
Отличная тема! Время не властно над этой командой!!! 👍
Anthony is in really good shape. 59 years old... awesome!
Oh I didn't know that "China" was the other name for "California".

Só de pensar que já fazem 20 anos que eu venho sendo privilegiado com a existência das suas músicas em minha vida, Red Hot é praticamente um pedaço de mim e está mais vivo do que nunca! 🌟
Strange.
Meh this would've been an irrelevant B side on Californication. They should've kept Josh and welcome John, they're a rich band they can have two guitarists, kicking Josh was one of the worst decisions and unrighteous ones.
Since "96. <3
Ahhhh Ahhhhhhhhhhh AAAAAAHHHHHHH
✳️
Kinda by the numbers as far as the RHCP go but still a good song nonetheless
im crying out of joy
BIENVENIDO FRUSCIANTE, TE EXTRAÑAMOS 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲

Really awesome to hear you playing together again after these black summers, this song got that old school RHCP spice feel with a new energi and i love it!
Commercial Radio Peppers
John♥️
i love this
Джон заехал отлично, красавец, хорошее звучание! Песня отличная, не супер хит, но я и не ждал еще один Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Как уже писали в коментах это ближе к звучанию Stadium Arcadium, ну и прекрасно. Рад, что они пишут новую музыку.
Anthony Kedis was on Epstein's flight log
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Welcome back Frusciante
🔥🎶😌
*LYRICS* A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip [Chorus] Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end
They're so bad now.  I chuckled through this video. BSSM was so good.
Let me guess what this song is about......CaLiFoRnIa.
FROOSH !!!!  🎸🎶❤️‍🔥

Great!

A melhor banda do mundo, com a melhor formação de todas! Viva o Red Hot!! 🇧🇷
YES. feels so good hearing John's guitar and backing vocals again after all this time. I still hope you guys bring Josh back in though, he stepped up when you needed him to
Kinda think the chords are a little generic and in general a bit Hendrix-heavy. Not super original. But I love the first solo and it is super catchy
Very good this sound
thanks! one love one live ! rhcp back!
É arrepiante meu fi 🔥🪨🤤
ОХУИНДЕР!
❤️🇧🇷
Glad they brought back Chad raw drum sound, John and Flea as always bonded, and Anthony what an amazing frontman the charisma is top notch no one else can replace him.
So glad I heard this today. They’re back and it’s great. Love that JF has got the sunburst strat going.
Awesome
Larga vida a Frusciante, intacta la esencia ❤️🌶️
B R A S I L   🇧🇷🥋🚄🔥🤟
色々あったけど、お帰りレッチリ🌶

the maturity of these guys' sound is impressive
Siempre van a ser unas leyendas
#BroughtBackFrusciante
Isso é muito emocionante pra mim, tenho uma história bem complexa envolvendo RHCP, principalmente com JF na banda. Esse é um dos dias mais felizes da minha vida. Obrigado RHCP 🥰
VOLVIERON LOS VERDADEROS CHILI PEPPERS. EMPEZO LA MANIJA. SALUDOS DESDE ARGENTINA
Vamos hay que hacerlos tendencia!!!!
Amazing!  RHCP is definitely my celestial family… So much connection with your music and lyrics through years. You are still the best! I love all of you 🤍
Can´t wait for the boys to fuck the censorship and speak their minds of Covid19.
Gracias ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Anthony Kiedis has completed his transition into Iggy Pop.
They fucking back
Bam!  Bravo, guys!!
Blows my mind that it sounds like a shanty! Love ettt!
I underestimated how much I needed this
I wish I had heard the song before seeing the video
Excepcional, Red Hot de volta ❤️
Endlich wieder vereint! Welcome back John! Großartiger Song!
Best!!
😂 I love Anthony's Gordon Lightfoot imitation! Is he a friggin stud or what? He looks 23 years old. I couldn't be more stoked about this next chapter in my fav bands story! Let's go!
And Chyina's on da dârk side o' da moon
Hermosoooo simplemente hermoso, me emocionó ver a los 4 nuevamente, grande los rhcp 💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que alegria verlos de nuevo
Hell yes! We all knew it would sound like they were never apart but hearing is believing. Come on September 8th!!!
😭😍😭😍😭 Meu momento!!!!!!! O meu Red Hot, aquele que há 17 anos atrás eu virei fã, finalmente voltou!!
Anthony is 59 years old....
Mmmmm that flangers sound brings back old memories  I am back young again like fuzz on John's guitar, energetic like Flea's slaps, versatile like Anthony's lyrics and strong like Chad's rhythm
Buena producción musical, John siempre luciéndose con su energía y entusiasmó al igual que flea Chad y Antony me encanto la canción espero ya veo la hora en que salga el álbum para deleitarme con tan buena música RHCP 2022 lo más lindo es que se viene mi cumpleaños y este es como el regalo más Preciado para mi y muchas personas, lo lindo que se siente volver a escucharlos y ver sus caras nuevamente con el regreso de John frusciante en la banda se harán las cosas más interesantes desde hoy en adelanten!! Like si escuchaste tan hermosa canción
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'. Waitin' on another RHCP album to come.
When i saw John's Strat I got chills
AMAZING!!!! Love u guys
Sir Frusciante is back.
hermoso día para estar vivo, la espera se hizo larga pero por fin terminó
Eu nunca esperei tanto por uma música quanto essa, e valeu a pena. O John precisou só de dois segundos pra me emocionar de novo. Simplesmente RHCP ❤️

THE BOYS ARE BACK!!!!
X
John … ❤️❤️❤️
This is exactly what I hoped it would be, it’s what we all needed it to be. Welcome back John, thank you and Anthony, Flea and Chad for this amazing gift. I can’t wait to hear them all but this one has lit that spark in me again! It HAS been a long time. Stunning, mind blowing, I’m in awe 🖤
Don't know what it is about these guys, but they always pierce to the heart of the vibe of my life experience. Sure, they're great musicians with a serious sense of creating earworms and such, but it's more. Wonderful tune here. Frusciante always elevates them to the next level, so it's great to have him back. If this is indicative of the rest of the album, going to be a treasure.
💛💛💛

The magic is back!!!!! The magic Fender Strat is back, and the magic bass, and the magic drummer and the magic voice.
THEY GOT SOME GUS DAPERTON DANCE MOVES! NICE.
Que música foda!!! Têm que vir logo para o Brasil! Queremos um show!
O tempo só deixa os caras melhores  i love Rhcp ❤❤❤❤
Welcome back, John. You were missed.
С возвращением, Джон! Как долго тебя не хватало!
La mejor banda del mundo en este genero , siempre tan creativos y con musica fresca :)
WELCOME BACK JOHN !
おかえり！俺たちのレッチリ！！
There is a god.
Ok, it's growing on me ! The more I listen to it, the more I like it :) Bravo guys and welcome back John !
Just look at frusciante right there 😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is way more special than the 3 spidermans on the No Way Home Movie
Every time these guys come back I am completely amazed how great they still are. No drop in quality ever!
2:15 A masterclass in how one simple but perfectly executed bend can accentuate an entire solo.
This song gives me an OUTSTANDING "SAVE THE POPULATION" vibes...
My reaction listening to this song "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you"
The way I play the bass and jam with other musicians has been influenced more than anything by Blood Sugar, One Hot Minute and Californication. I don't think this is my favorite RHCP song but it is a warm and fuzzy feeling to see these guys delivering the same sound and chemistry - again! And after reading Acid For The Children, I can appreciate the LA sunset setting and references to Flea and Anthony's early days (the riding on the shoulders bit). I never listened much to anything after By The Way, but I want to hear the new album with John <3
Che bomba regà Però droppate l’album
Wow 👍
AHORA SÍ CRJ! RED HOT ESTÁ DE REGRESO ❤️✨
I dont like it that much.
Caramba achei que era musica antiga , depois que fui ver que é de hoje kkkkk
Frusciante is the missing piece. The K man was good for sure, but John back with the og 3 is just the perfect chemistry.
Conheci aos 11 anos, 2001..  e desde o primeiro momento vi logo de cara que era uma banda incrível.  Me emociona vê-los na ativa assim! 💛
Thank's for this great performance guys, and welcome back John!!!
vi amooooooo
finally, our legends appears again!!!
Frusciante = Jesus ✝️
Please hire Dave Sheridan as your stage dancer for the tour 😎
Brutal. No dejen de hacer música <3
It's crazy how this band can write a song 30 years after their break out album and it sounds just as incredible as anything they released in the 90s  That's really impressive
Incrível, incrível, incrível
Uaaaa wonderful! What a song! RCHP being RHCP
At the beginning i was like okay this is good but then it kicked in and I was like okay that’s The Peppers for sure. Nice to know there keeping it real. At least one band is!!!!
Nice Jimi Hendrix/Frank Marino feel 0:44 - 0:55
With a good singer (like Mike Patton for ex) this song could have been ok.
I'm gonna go poop while listening to this xd
I am very happy to see John!!
Legends! I'm happy when I'm listening RHCP music. Wait full album and concerts ❤️
Finally, RHCP their back
If all the songs on the album are the same, then I feel that my "fears" of two years ago will be confirmed that with such a level of requirements and expectations of the fans, the peppers with the new "uninteresting" album will sit in a puddle and everyone will start to miss Klinghoffer)) Such shit happens often by the way :)  As for the song, yes, the guitar part is cool, but the mood that I “thought up” to myself (as it turned out) when listening to that piece released the other day was many times more pleasant and enthusiastic than the song itself in the end.  It’s like Anthony doesn’t give a fuck what’s going on, but maybe it seems to me)) Some too noticeable auto-tuning and country tunes didn’t impress me at all.  Let's see what happens next)
I knew 2022 is gonna be good
Todos los que amamos a John Frusciante dejen su like 👇👇👇
Toppp
Never really liked rhcp but it won't happen either after this song.
So good to see John again!!
👌
🌶  🌶  🌶  🌶
2:40 Riding on a headless horse to make the trip......................................... BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I MADE A NEW FRIEND.  Impossible to not feel your heart going out of your mouth at this part, excited to see this live 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anthony, do you have Autotune or Melodyne effecting your voice?  Get rid of it, it sounds shite!!!!!
Timbre à la Rivers of Avalon! Finalmente o RHCP volta à ativa depois de longos 14 anos de pausa!
Wicked song although the only downside is that they don't talk bout ice cream for an astronaut
After sooo many years 🥲 Finally some good music 🙏
This sounds like it could have been taking straight from Stadium Arcadium. Simply amazing fellas👏
i'll back here in 10 years
1:52 eu vou chorar de emoção 🤧😭
Big YEEEEES
nobody: Absolutely nobody: John:WE NEED MORE GUITAR SOLOS
Anthony Kiedis você tem uma voz incrível cara, está cantando muito, que energia incrível de vocês, o John está genial como sempre Flea é espetacular e Chad com umas levadas na bateria que pulsam nossos corações 😍😍😍😍😍😍
John Frusciante! 💜💙💚🧡💛❤💗
I could die happy right now... This is amazing! This was better than expected and more than I could have hoped for. Thank you RCHP! I'll be seeing you in the bay are in July!
Fucking amazing!
ооооо! бальзам на душу, мои любимки!
Mullets is part of the Übermensch
神よ

Tiger king with a new music video?
I love R.H.C.P !!!
What is Kiedis talking about man
John Frusciante (god) is back and more beautiful than ever.  🖤
THIS IS RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS!
Yay...what a great song. So excited you're back with new music 🎉🥳🥰
You can totally tell that John is back something that they had lost with the last guitar player, it just never seemed right with him.. Sounds like they never lost a beat
Just a masterpiece! 🔥🔥
China is on the dark side of the moon...the artist talks about his time. And Frusce and Flea always saving the songs.
Not a spectacle, but not bad either, they are on the right way to be back!
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Старые, добрые перцы... резкие, но на удивление очень мелодичные.
Um sonho sendo realizado 🤩👏 ver o john na banda e muito emocionante 🤧♥️🥰
Yun oh bat wala to sa when we we"re young
Keanu Reeves on guitar?
Gracias por más una canción que nos emociona y hará parte de nuestras vidas para siempre! Nos vemos en Sevilla!!!
love it thailandfans
No mistake, John's fingerprints stood out in this song. Reminds me of the slower jams they play from by the way album. 🌶
I can't believe that I'm alive to see the golden lineup of the peppers release a new single and album. I'm in tears 🤧😭
Welcome back, John Frusciante
whole lotta respect to Josh who carried on his shoulders the burden to be the next after John. And I felt not confortable the way how they got John back in the band. That said, wellcome back, Mr. Frusciante. Wellcome back, Mr. Fender.
Anthony, Chad, Flea, what a great song keep em coming, and John so glad to have you back🔥❤️🔥
John is proving he is just the last brick in the wall. I love he’s shirt btw
Love it!
From Philippines I'm your number1 fan. #R.H.C.P.
VAMO LO REJOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fuck yeahhhhh!!!
RESPECT FROM BRAZIIILL🇧🇷🇧🇷
John Is back
1:51 반갑습니다. 눈물이 흐르네요😂😂😂😂😂

This is a banger.
Great to hear John Frusciante sound again.
Puta que o pariu

Молодцы перцы 🌶 🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations for your fantastic composition and production! Awesome super high quality arangement and recording. I feel the great work behind this. Also I like the film editing, it is really inspiring.  I also congratulate you with the successful collaboration with the mastering service that you use! Continuesly composing for  the universe ! Have a great musical week, dear friends! My dearest friend shared a music video. Have a safe blessed day and see you soon forever !!🦋🌸 Thanks for subscribing it is worth the time to watch. https://youtu.be/WtgGQ7Msrgs
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
NICE, NICE, NICE!!!
I discovered them when I was 12, 9 years ago. People said that I was just acting, that how can I like them that much, that i wasn’t even alive in their best era, but how can I explain that I love them just so freaking much because of all the emotions they bring to me in every single song? I don’t enjoy only the rhythm or maybe lyrics, I enjoy them, and I’m so grateful that I can still watching them together and working on music because the vibes their songs gives are just unique. Thanks Chili Peppers for making so many people happy, for keeping so many dreams of watching a rhcp live concert,  sorry I just can’t find the proper expressions but I got emotional like the rest of the comments section hehe.  Love y’all, love rhcp, love the rhcp family❤️
Finally! This is the Peppers back to the way they were.  Can’t wait to hear more from them. Welcome back John!
🤘🇵🇪🤘
IMPRESSIONANTE !
John Frusciante, thank you for showing me what music is
дожил....
Ah bene deh
por jonh me hice guitarrista y ahora verlo en la actualidad y haber crecido con el me da mucho sentimiento viva jimi hendrix
Just got this in Apple Music - the album cover is animated. Nice!
Vida longa aos Red Hot Chili Peppers

15 años esperando la banda completa con un frucciante de leyenda! Larga vida a los Chili Peppers!
Endless, timeless ❤

Nice work!!! Can't wait to see other stuff!😃
John i love u😍😍
Sensacional demais essa canção. É tão bom ver o Frusciante de volta
Korn and Rhcp! On the same day.. They are totally different, But they are my both favorite!
chili men are back!!!   This one is definitely a new banger!!
Эх, перцы... Спасибо вам за лучшие музыкальные звуки! Вы всегда в моем личном топе... Но только не в этой версии - какая то беззубая скучная музыка. Не хочу портить впечатления о вас, поэтому переслушаю ка я лучше blood sugar sex magic, чем эту блевотню на угоду публике!
Awesome
RHCP still rocking!!!
What the hell is that mullet hair cut...
Os brabos voltaram!
Lady and gentlemen now we're going to past . please let fun with this fuckin chilli.🔥🔥
Amazing as always, keep rocking!!!!!!
🥰🥰🥰
Been a fan ever since their first song, and to see them play after such a long time, just brings joy to my heart. Still my favorite band :)
Super Cool!
Дааа, это то, что все хотели
Through darkness. Through brightness. Red Hot Chili Peppers forever ♥
Que vibe foda essa música nos trás! RHCP até o fim 🇧🇷♥️
So fuckin happy that John's back 😭❤️
So, Will Ferrell plays drums for the RHCP now?
Beautiful to hear frusciante back,and that unmistakable sound they have together, they have been one of the bands to the soundtrack of my life...since the early 90s..seeing them in June for the first time live and then the foo fighters 5 days later..gonna be some emotions and partying to be had🤘🏽😝
Hearing John’s voice in the backing vocal again brought a tear to my eye, took me through all the years of listening to them, beautiful
Este es el sonido real de los Red Hot, por fin está el equipo completo y la canción es el reflejo de ello. Excelente!!
We've all been waiting ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing solo
I have waited so many years for this!! I'm not crying, your crying!
Mantap ini yg gw tunggu-tunggu
Que mejor momento para estar vivo! frusciante ha vuelto!!!!
homi voltou pra casa e pra glória da banda
Essa banda é muito foda... Eu escuto eles desde dos meus 7 anos até hoje eu lembro a primeira vez que ouvi uma música deles foi do show Slane castle meu pai chegou com o dvd desse show nossa fiquei a semana toda vendo e revendo muito foda!!
Ide gas
Great, John Wick now also plays guitar
Obrigado mestres!
😍😍😍😍😍💥
Oh, I’m so glad to see John with band again!
I'm so glad they are back! I loved Josh's talent and we can hear John's style again. Everyone in the band is doing flawlessly!
la era post Stadium Arcadium de verdad ❤️
Наконец-то! Как долго я этого ждал! Спасибо!
vamo los red hot!!
😯😯😯😯😯😯👏👏👏👏👏 bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏 que buenooooo!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Finally!
Love it, so happy to see this pop up in my feed! Anyone else feel like the first minute or two sounds a bit like a sea shanty? Not just the music but the way Anthony intonates some Rs (e.g. "China's on the daRk side of the moon" at around 0:40). Maybe a nod to the sea shanties people were posting on TikTok during the pandemic along with so much else in the lyrics in reference to these pandemic times. So great to see some beautiful art born in response to the difficulties of the past two years, because we all know "destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation."
Aperte F a todos que não viram a volta do Frusciante ao Red Hot Chili Peppers...
The greatest are back and together again 😭
Amor total para los RHCP. Verlos envejecer es verme envejecer junto a ellos, son ustedes el soundtrack de mi vida.
My dream came true omg love u guys!!!
Muito massa 👏👏👏👏👏
Gran banda, buen sonido, la solidez la tienen y la canción es buenísima! Gracias por la magia chicos // Great band, good sound, they have solidity and the song is great! Thanks for the magic guys ❤🔥🌶
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm soooooooo happy right now!!!! Unable to sleep!!!!
John Frusciante just hit his best performance EVER... AND THIS BAND!!! OmG this band has been in my life so long, and they never fail to amaze me. Kiedis and those vocals never faulter. They have an endless supply of talent, and this song proves they can keep changing up their groove, without loosing the mystic. Way to go RHCP. Thank you for bringing another dimension to our lives!!!
Son  increíbles vengan a Angentina 🇦🇷

Tremenda energía ❤️✨🤩
Это Ильич на гитаре что ли ,красная наклейка ?
조오타...

Josh did a stand up job for all those years..... But I just cried actual tears once John kicked off the guitar work. Beautiful song. And welcome back Mr Frusciante ❤️
i love rhcp..thier doing thier job..and never stop whats ever happened
IM CRYING THIS IS AMAZING!!! Everything I could’ve wanted from a new chili peppers song!!
i love them ❤️
As much as I adore every member of this band, and they’re all freakishly talented, John really is what makes them transcendentally legendary. They’re gonna be great with any guitarist, and Josh was great, don’t get me wrong; but like any time John is playing with these guys it produces nothing but an absolute masterpiece. Every. Single. Time.
Cheio de BR aqui 😍🤘🏽🇧🇷
Finally..awsome single is reallese

It seems like John got inspired by his own Fight for Love Cover :-D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vdp9C0Dt8_c
Штож, кажется всё на месте: торс Энтони, рубашка Джона, пончо Фли и кепка Чеда. Наконец-то🥲
RHCP forever and ever🥰🥰🥰
This is beautiful ❤️ Love u guys, please play at least one song you made with josh to tribute him. He deserve it. Also dave and Hilel. ❤️
Mais quel plaisir de réentendre ce son... Je viens de faire une larme. Les Red Hot Chili Peppers c'est déifinitivement ces 4 là. Super chanson, super mélodie. Vivement le Stade de France. Bravo et merci les Red Hot !  Édit : c’est déjà un classique des red hot, super chanson

2:33 62년생 환갑 할아버지의 피지컬...ㄷㄷㄷ
“The night is dressed like noon, A sailor spoke too soon, And China is on the dark side of the moon”  Yeah those are RHCP lyrics alright. Welcome back guys!
Welcome back John, welcome guys, we missed you a lot !
I feel that the soul of the band is back, love you frusciante
待ってました！
It's like coming home after years 💛
A GUITARRINHA DO FRUSCIANTE *_*
OMG, después de tantos años!!! Los amo!!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️❤️❤️😍
That's a jam.
His voice still amazing 🗿
Mr. Frusciante 🤟🤟🤟
RHCP is magic for me
Wait this shit.!

Decade and half waiting for this
Assistindo over and over again, só pra ver o John!  Minha vida todinha ali, nesses 4 caras!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's good to see John Frusciante 💜
And Ive been waiting for these motherfuckers to release something together since 2007
Nice ❤️ Original Red Hot Chili Peppers 🤘🏻
John Anthony motherfuckin’ Frusciante 😻❤️🌝🙏
Y llegó el día...
The The legend is back
Around The World energy
it’s coming
John mf Frusciante
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘❤️
Anthony looks a lot like his dad, I think it's in his honor that he took his look.
❤❤❤
fuck, those frusciante tunes could eat my soul
he's back
Hace casi 40 años que hacen canciones perfectas, no debería sorprendernos esta maravilla... Aún así no podemos evitar que semejante temazo nos de justo en el ❤️  Larga vida a RHCP 🔥🔥🔥
The more I listen to it. The more I like it. I still have high hopes for the album :)
One love! Kaif!🔥 Here I look at the uncles and understand that even at 59 you can give out goodness. What do former heroin addicts look like and play like? It's amazing. That's the power of music! Peace and Love!
Omygod!!the sound of guitar though!!!!
Same vibe, same magic, pure talent Red hot chili peppers is medicine for the soul
The sound of RHCP is back!!!!
Stadium arcadium vibes
amazing guitar tone in the intro...sooo hendrix..frusciante is the guitar player of this century!!
I've been waiting for this song to come out for 3 years now, when the announced that John was joining and it didn't disappoint. Now to wait for the full album😄
Fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Que lindo estar vivo para poder ver el regreso de la banda que me inspiró! Te extrañaba frusciii de mi corazón!vengan a Uruguay por favor!
Фрушантэ вернулся и группа ,зазвучала !
Another song only 3 band on the planet can cover....  Flea is something special.
Guitar is back
They are back, what a tune!!! I love it.
John is back...Red Hot Chili Peppers are back!!!
John…！！！！😭💕
Is it just me or does this song feel too short? Like its missing some parts or something.
Live Long RHCP !
Как всегда бесподобны)
Whaouu it's the big comeback, I love it. I've been waiting for this for so long
Bentornato John Frusciante!
💝 I love you RHCP
как всегда шикарно !
damn anthony fine as hell
Amazing
Grandissimi...... Rock!!!! Frusciante e Flea!!!!!
The bestttttt!!! Red hot caralhooo... Brasil te amaaaa
I'm so fucking ready for this album!
Надеюсь в песню заложен тонкий троллинг BLM мракобесия, что творилось этим летом ;-)
Obrigado por estarem vivos e manterem essa chama linda e viva chamada RHCP  sempre em nossas vidas ... Obrigado e Viva o Red Hot Chili Peppers
Just amazing 🌞
This has by the way vibes, i love it
Unbelievable. Thank god John is back.
Vencemos!
Anthony O'Kiedis.
Maybe I'm just an addicted idiot, but I literally feel the unlimited love from this track. This song has a big heart. <3
Thanks God for allowing me to live this.
Чувствуется олдскул от перцев, старый звук возвращается)
This song reminds me their old hits
Fucking fire
god, they are old
welcome back frusciante
a picasso is a picasso is a picasso
lançamento de RHCP p começar o ano da virada
Red Hot Chili Peppers are back !
New RHCP Music? With John on guitar? Sign me up right now, i love this band so much
John feels like Stadium Arcadium, Anthony feels like I’m With You, Chad feels like Californication, Flea feels like Flea
F*ck yeah John, f*ck yeah!! THE MAN is back, you can hear it. God bless Frusciante for all those sounds, for the space, for heart and emotions! Best day ever!
Missed John's vocal in the background.. Welcome back buddy
Los primeros 4 segundos fueron puro goce 🥵🥵 te extrañaba frusciante
Stadium Arcadium 2
Josh is great and all, but THIS is RHCP
Gracias RHCP ❤️, con el pasar de los años siguen siendo una de las mejores bandas del mundo en su estilo , únicos , no creo que en esta vida pueda existir una química tan perfecta como la de Chad , Flea, , John y Anthony , a pesar de sus idas y vueltas conservan ese espíritu y ganas de hacer buena música para sus fans , ya el sonido de esta canción  confirma que se viene un gran disco , que manija esperar por escuchar todo el disco , gracias muchachos por existir , larga vida al rock and roll 🤘🏼
This made my fucking week!
I love this. It has such a unique RHCP sound.
Seeing John there just feels right doesn't it ❤️
It's amazing John has this Hendrix quality to his playing, his feel and sense of the guitar is amazing, I have been listening to this band for 35 year's John makes them a better band.
This dream team back together ❤️
Quem conhece ao menos um pouquinho da história da banda, ficou em êxtase quando ouviu o timbre da guitarra do Frusciante saturado novamente. (Não aquela barulheira que o Josh fazia quando tocava. Com todo respeito ao músico, claro.) O próprio Rick Rubin (nem preciso explicar quem é, né?) disse em entrevista que chorou ao ouvir o quarteto de volta tocando, "Tem algo mágico aqui", e ele estava certo. A melodia e estrutura musical é simples, mas é linda e aquece o coração da gente assim como o Californication fez em 1999. Ansioso para ouvir o álbum todo e vê-los ao vivo em breve! ❤
John Fruschiante!!! Everibody, moter.. ...r John Fruschiante!!! You-who!!! (SLANE)
Waitin' on Another Black Summer to End 🎶
Круто. Золотой состав
Yess, 2022 already feels better than 2021!
Damn good to see the old gang back again, John is love 😍
Tô tão feliz por esse presente pra nois fans!!
Los eternos.
omggggggg I love it
Hell yeah🤘🏼!!
Красиво, очень радует что все в хорошей физической форме 👍🤟🤟🤟
here is the lyrics  [Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
We missed you John Frusciante. Welcome back, glad to see you again in a pepper's music video since 2007.
1:56 the fact that John is again using his old guitar from RHCP golden years is hitting me right into my heart
Great band! I'm so glad! Sound is wonderful!
Legends……
See you at FirenzeRocks!
Finally! Love you guys!
This feels like 1999 when Californication dropped.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
FINALLY it´s here! Waited for 16 years...Fucking awesome. Unlimited love cannot come fast enough...LETS GOOOOOOOO
Os melhores 💥
Я так счастлив и рад, моя любимая группа собралась в золотом составе, вселенная пришла в баланс, спасибо, шикарная мелодия и песня....я плачу... спасибо!))
Me gusta más cada vez que la escucho. Con los solos de John cierro los ojos y el sonido me lleva a hace 20 años
Impressionante a energia, magia é contagiante ver Jhon de volta de onde nunca deveria ter saído, Longa Vida aos Peppers que música fantástica
These guys don't get old, same magical music, frusciante looks and sounds awesome
That Hendrix space spice thou! Nice !
I'm just grateful for this. Thank you ❤
una cosa es con guitarra y cajon , Frusciante poniendo su calidad,
will farrell still rocking those drums
Да, народ, вам не кажется!!! Это новая песня из предстоящего нового альбома!) как же я ору сейчас!) Снова знакомый голос, снова знакомые звуки до боли знакомой гитары Джона мать его Фрустраче, но всё это в новой песне!) Я вас всех поздравляю, и удачи вам в том, чтобы остановиться от постоянных перематываний в начало трека. У меня пока не получается) From Russia with love, guys!)) Welcome back, John!
Does Flea have Lenin on his bass guitar?
What a great gift from the band. Welcome back John!
Ive been waiting for this since 2006. Josh did a great job but John Frusciante + Flea = one of the great gifts of the universe.
A maior banda do planeta! ❤️
fucking legends
Eehhh! Trash!
Клип и песня кайф👍🏻)
God I miss that flannel-wearing, long haired jesuss-like with a strat guy.
1:52 Clean it up John
And just like that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are good again.
❤❤❤
BACK TO THE 90's and 00's 😭😢 !!!
This band really can get worst álbum after álbum ? ; Oh yes they can , boring boring boring.
Oh Wow!
Наверное со мной что то не так, но как же Энтони в этом образе напоминает Билана)) 😅
Brabo!
Hearing John blast out a new solo almost brought this old man to tears!!! About time real music with real instruments made a return!! 🤟
Damn this is so damn good
Are you in guys?
Its rare that new songs of old bands are this good!
🏹🐎☀️🌒
Kiedis looks amazing with his new hair. 💪🏻 This man really never gets old.
omg ily guyss
Que hino!!!! Te amo Anthony!
Yaşlandık be.
frusciante in peppers = same emotions as tobey maguire in spider man
Well, not really impressed. And the weakest point of the this self-repeating song is.. guitar. In sound, in originality... Nothing close to Stadium Arcadium. Great to hear them united with John. But still not persuasive, sorry
jimi vibes
MEU DEUSSSS, OBRIGADA POR ISSO ❤️🌶️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
AE CARAIOOO!!! <3<3<3
so we all just gonna ignore how atrociously generic this is?
Awesome !
💚🇧🇷🇧🇷🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
FRUSCIANTE IS BACKK!!
Thank God for Red Hot.. 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
My man john is back 😎
amazing!
SIMPLESMENTE PIKA, TA?!
Home sweet home mas John! Gasske bossku 🔥
Achei bem fraca. Espera um funkão ou um rock tipo dani Califórnia, algo bem mais memorável
Los Amo con TODO mi Corazon, el Regreso de John Frusciante hace que vuelva a mi niñez, era tan necesario su regreso. I can't wait to see you in Mexico, i Love RHCP with all my heart.
Does anyone else love this band but despise Anthony Keidis?
FRUSCIANTE!!
AMAZING!
Selamat datang kembali john frusciante
Que sensação maravilhosa!!!
Eles estão de volta juntos e NADA mudou! Que banda maravilhosa
amazing
Greetings from Brazil! Amazing song
Maravilhoso. Bem vindo de volta Frusciante🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Nice auto-tune, Anthony.
música maravilhosa ❤🇧🇷
This Concert finna be gobsmacking gorgeous
All i see is Flea, Will Ferrell and the Joe Exotic . Is this a RHPC tribute band ?
let's fucking GO
❤🇧🇷
LOS AMOOOOOO😍❤️
Todos amamos a Frusciante. 🥰
This is the best thing that could have happened ❤❤❤ Anthony lasted 1.30 minutes in a shirt)) Это лучшее, что могло случиться ❤❤❤ Энтони продержался 1,30 минуты в рубашке))
¡Hermosísimo!
I think I have fallen back in love with RHCP, what a banging tune guys! Glad you guys are not going too mainstream (as some rock-bands are)
Oh yeah, this is great!!! 🤘🤘
Uffff 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 está buenísimo!!!
ME ENCANTA SU ENERGÍA!   LOS AMO!♡
Anthony has finally completed his transformation as the modern day Iggy Pop
En el más allá dice un viejo amigo , “hey #frusciante ! Loco la vida son 4 días y ya pasaron 3 , vive y haz vivir a los demás “
Well-well, isn't it just boring?
RHCP essence in a new one music. 🔥
Sin hablar mucho, resumo todo diciendo: al escuchar esta canción es como volver al primer libro que te dio amor, a la primera película que te hizo llorar de pasión, al primer amor que ya no está o al amor que siempre estuvo pero te olvidaste de como amar. Con frusciante todo es genial y lo más importante, volvió a su casa y nadie le negó la entrada.
Nunca pensé ver este momento
He is back my friends, he is back!
hay paja hay paja
What a year 2022 will be. The crew is back! Bigger n better! This song rocks! Love you guys!
John 😍🍀
Temoooon muy bueno😍👏 👏 cómo los amo, cuando vuelven a ARGENTINA , muero de ganas por verlos. ♥️♥️♥️
Джон Фрусчанте врывается в чат! John Frusciante breaks into the chat!
The day has finally come 🙌

Climate change is all natural!

Oh yeah, 40 seconds John´s solo in the first single after 15 years. That´s what we NEEDED!!!

Tudo o que um fã dos chili peppers queria. Musiquinha nova pra alegrar o coração
Essa música veio com tanta vibe de Red hot chili peppers que mesmo  escutando a primeira vez eu já  sentia saudades dela. Como se ela estivesse em algum lugar lá no passado. 🇧🇷❤️🌶️
This has some old b-sides vibes
Каеф ! спасибо !
Hello again from algeria 🇩🇿

Thais song reminds me some songs of stadium arcadium album
You, my Chili Peppers are beautiful as always 💟
They're back! With signature John Frusciante
Good to ear from You again!
No words. Just 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Love it, love you all 😍🤟🤘💗🎶🎵

Amazing. Was just having a Stadium Arcadium session yesterday and then up pops this!
Certo che con frusciante è tutta un'altra cosa..............
Conheci o som da banda , eu devia ter os meus 12 anos, hoje com 38 posso dizer que pra mim é a melhor banda de rock que existe!!!! Vivi até agora para ver esse retorno com John,  não tem pra ninguém esses 4 juntos, que música phodaaaa !!!!!
Sencillamente, desde el primer acorde, es una canción de ellos y sólo ellos. No sé cómo lo hacen, pero su sonido es inmortal. Gracias por volver, seguir, permanecer.
Grazie eeeeee
seeing john just feels good, holy shit
Yessssss muito bom 😎 muito massa, escutar 10 vezes por dia 😎
Great thing to wake up to a new video!!
Aaaaaaaaa
QUE MOMENTO PARA ESTAR VIVOOOO
Jesus Christ! They are the band of my life! I love this guys so much!!! I can’t believe I’m seeing this formation again!!!! If I’m dreaming, please do not wake me up!!!!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end

Thanks for this!!!! We miss you guys!  I'm ver excited!
I've waited 10 years... thank you Peppers <3
AAAAAA ESTAN DE VUELTA
Fruscianteeeeee🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Looking at the comments I'm getting strong opening reactions to The Phantom Menace vibes here.  Let's be honest... that was just bland at best and AK's vocal track is awful.  Still I remain hopeful.  I've been waiting so long for this.
RHCP Never disappoints!
anthony's dancing is my warmup before fight since now.
I' m so happy they didn' t become something like Coldplay or Marrom 5, who lost themselves. Over 30 years on the road and still going strong. Gods bless those sexy sexy beasts the Chilis!
Instant like! Together again!
Made my entire year. They still are as awesome and amazing. Love seeing  John Frusciante with them 😭❤
John’s solo is some good ol’ epic shit
泣きそうだわ
yessss, I’m so happy to see frusciante playing again!!!
How RHCP supposed to sound
Voltou a ficar bom!!!
Thanks
Les juro que no entiendo casi mucho del ingles pero sigo a esta banda que es mi favorita ya hace mas de 8 años y creanme que sus canciones siempre son mis favoritas, larga vida a RHCP Los adoro chicos sigan por mas <3 saludos desde piura peru.
WOW so lucky to see this right away!! sweet!!!
welcome back john!
Best birthday present ever! Thank you! I am crazy about it!
Yes, RHCP never dissapoint me, good see them together again :)
I love you guys so much!! My favorite bands are RHCP and LP 🤘🏽
caralho vcs são mto foda SEM PALAVRASSSSSS
I'm crying. Are you crying?
Thank YOu! The best way to start the weekend -with You Guys!
Agora sim. Aquela vibe que só os Chilli Peppers sabem transmitir.
Still Old.. Still Gold..
Simply amazing
I love it. So good
Amazing in love!
Loving the music and having John back, but what's with Kiedis's weird vocal inflections in this song?
Whoa, just dropped
Will ferrel is the new drummer 🤔
Finally back together. This is the line up I fell in love with as a young boy. They still sound great
Great new song! Now on my 5th listen. Anthony's vowel pronunciation in the verses clearly influenced by 2021's sea shanty craze too - a fun innovation. Roll on Unlimited Love!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
feels like I'm 15 again, sitting with fellows on the floor somewhere in the park, singing rhcp like there's no problems we couldn't solve
...noch ein Video das man nicht sehen muss!!!! Music ist ach ach neeeeee mit ü 50 sich wie teenager geben ist einfach lächerlich..klar sind die Jungs auch noch in Schuss zumindest siehts so aus ( haben aber auch die finanz.Möglichkeiten auch wenn die Arbeit an sich man immer noch selbst machen muss ) aber kommt schon, jeden Trend nachrennen um Sein Publikum zu pleasen ist genauso lächerlich...lieber nur die mUsik ohne dies unfassbar lächerliche Acten. 1/10....schade.
They are finally back. This feels like Californication all over again.
Not a single word of California 😂💜💛
Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!!! Finally they're back, as if they never left!
Дедушка фли все еще прыгуч, кидис - совсем индеец, фуршанте грязен как бог, чад просто прекрасен,
yeaaahhhhhhh  !!!!!
Mano, 2022 e red hot ta mais vivo que nunca... que dia meus amigos, que lindo dia
Yeah!!👍
Welcome back, we missed you ❤️
I'm glad Will Farrell returned to play the drum...such a huge fan. He's a talented artist.
Nice to hear them Amen Breaks.......No surprises there! Thanks John 🦑🤟🏼
Y x fin llegó el 1er single del nuevo álbum de mis amados RHCP. Mis compañeros de la vida. Volvió la magia con el retorno de Frusciante 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 . Uno siente que cada uno está cantando con su intrumento. Anthony con la voz, Flea con el bajo, John con la guitarra y Chad con la batería. Simplemente, sincronización. . La música en tiempos del covid.
RHCP is the same again with John Frusciante  <3
Hell Yeaa! Wellcome Johnboy 😎👍
They're back. Well happy
I love you Frusciante!
Welcome back John Frusciante, we've missed you so much <3
I’m going crazy i swear
They get their sound back.  It's like being 13 again and hear them for first time 😊
AAAAA FINALMENTE DISCO NOVO DO RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! Tava esperando por isso, minha sexta feira ficou até mais animada com essa música 🤟❤️🌶️
JOHN FRUSCIANTE ES MAGIA PURA 🌠🌟✨💫🌟✴ CON ESA GUITARRA 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🔥🔥🔥❤
Agradecido de ser un fan de los rhcp. Por siempre será mi banda favorita! 🇲🇽💪
I was waiting🎸❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
chorei no solo do frusciante
Really. Healthy. Cosmic. People.
It's Amazing.
Whys he singing in an Irish accent?
Congrats to every one who has been patiently waiting for almost 6 years!
a faixa tá ótima, só que eu achei muito fraca comparada aos trabalhos do josh, espero que as outras músicas sejam melhores.
BEAUTIFUL!
Another comeback my childhood athem after SOAD & Avril lavigne
... I just wanna cry
やっぱ、ジョンのソングライターとしての才能は抜群です！心地良さが半端ないです！
Red Hot Chili FLETES
Живите вечно, это охуенно.
0:51 yep, he's there.
I've been waiting 6 years for this We didn't even get B-sides on the last one. And Frusciante is back! You can tell the magic is there again.
The video is like an upgraded version of the video for under the bridge haha!
Ficouuuu foda de mais 🤘🏻🤘🏻 som vc escuta e já sente nostalgia e sabe que daqui 20 anos vai tá ouvindo feliz pacas
すんげぇ筋肉‼︎59歳‼︎ すんげぇ良い曲‼︎ 興奮して涙ちょちょギレたぁ‼︎ やっぱジョン最高~‼︎
Wooow, they still got it. Feels so good seeing John Frusciante on guitars again
Não mudam! Quase 40 anos de banda e eles continuam com a mesma essência Simplesmente amo eles❤️❤️
The best Dad Rock on Earth.
Да ладно, новые перцы, как старые перцы))
CHE MO PIRIMBA!!!!
Wow, beautiful song, beautiful melody. John Frusciante proving why he's born to play with these 3 guys. All the layered guitar, solos and backing vocals are incredible. The musicianship of these guys is amazing. Love how clearly you can here Flea's bass on this too. Chad's sounding awesome as ever, and then Anthony knocks it out of the park (again) with some of his lyrical wizardry. After everything over the last few years, the world could really do with a new album from these guys. They still feel relevant I think cause they're true creative artistic soul's, they reflect something people can relate to, awesome.
🔊🎶 the guy's are back better and stronger than ever 💪 love love love this song ❤️ can't wait to listen the entire album 🤗  bravi bravi bravi 👏👏👏
Return of the king !!!  Jon frusciante for life ❤️
В момент, когда Чад вступил с барабанами, я кивнул и сказал: оно!
welcome back
2022 just got way better. Lots of love and respect for the legends.
noice.
The GOATED line-up is back 🫂
Tastes like stadium arcadium
Yes! Frusciante is back!!!        again
Massa demais ver o Frusciante de volta
Frusciante comes and goes like the leaves on a tree
Killer song!!! Welcome back, @John Frusciante!!!!!!!!!!! Happy to c ya all back together, gods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! **ck, I am 45-year old crying man right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭🤘
Yes,guitar driven music 👍
I LOVE IT
Difícil opinar sem ouvir o resto do disco. A expectativa é grande por causa da volta do John, esperamos um bom álbum.
0:46 Thought I would never see this guitar in this context again
Ну неплохо для первого сингла
This is perfet! welcome again Johnny
Azərbaycandan qucaq dolusu salamlar!
New version black hol sun 🤣😂

Amazing 🙂
Great Song...I Lovely
Getting emotional reading all the comments about how RHCP changed peoples lives, especially when it comes to music. You can add one more to that list. John is the reason I picked up a guitar.  The undercurrent of truth in the music still runs strong 🤘🏼
Viva los RHCP, viva Frusciante 🌶❤️
Uauuuuuu vida longa a melhor banda do mundo

♥️♥️🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🤘🏻🤘🏻🍻
Kocham ❤ pozdrowienia z Polski ❤
The way he pronounces the lyrics in the verses sounds like an old shanty, which goes along well with the way these guys are looking nowadays. If they all decides to just start dressing up as pirates, wouldn’t even feel out of place, lol.  The song slaps, it’s a wonderful return to the John era. Can’t wait to see how this album turns out!
Já apaixonei nessa música imagina o álbum todoooooooooo. Os brasileiros surtam!
старички уже не те.....
Chorus sounds like Ballad of Dwight Fry by Alice Cooper
Your music is timeless. Thank you 👍
I cried at the end of this because of that classic, nostalgic sound of you four back together and writing such beautiful music. Thank you for bringing back my childhood days and making another amazing song. Welcome back John! #RHCPForever
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Молодцы! И Джон заехал с отличнейшим соло 🎸  Это именно тот стиль и та музыка, которую все помнят и ждут!
Kiedis keeps fighting like a ninja and now with a bow!! We have 16 tracks to hear the word… you now what i mean. I love you guys so much
Johnny is back!!!
Auto-tune has taken the Peppers. Unfortunate.
Will Ferrell killing the drums
2:13 looking forward to covering this and all the upcoming covers to show. Vocals too y'all!!
I cant stop crying.. I just love you so much guys.. I grew up with you and its like live life togheter.. I was 8 years old when i put for the first time the cd of cali on my ears and i never stop to follow you on the years.. An infinite search of your cd lp cassette.. Now im 31 yo and see John after all this time togheter.. My god i just cant really explain.. I love you guys ❤ ❤

I got goosebumps when i saw Frusciante back
*please invite josh for live performances* *i love chillis with john & josh*
I've waited so long for this moment! We love you so much John! ❤️
RHCP❤🇹🇭❤🇹🇭❤🇹🇭
It's great to have John, Chad, Flea, and Tigerking back!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Des frissons, merci les gars
John Frusciante is back!! RHCP.
All of my love California boys❤️
Well, I think we’ll never be surprised again as we were when Californication came. Just another RHCP’s generic pop song. With the best musicians in the world, but generic. Next.
Good to see Frusciante back. Vocals bit weak bit  it's rhcp so all good
This is just amazing!
Que volta essa banda é perfeita jhon de volta pra onde nunca deveria ter saido
Grande john!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻 que lindo tenerlos de vuelta 😍❤️
Oh my God! the master is back in the family!

John, we missed you so much.
Chili peppers/Janes Addiction/Irish amazing combo. Damn do I love this band. Thank you for coming back John!
Chad tá tão animado nesse vídeo que ele inventa até de querer cantar kkkkkkk
FINALMENTE A VOLTA DO JOHN ❤️❤️❤️❤️ MANO TE AMO RED HOT
PQP que energia !!
Anthony is almost a 60 years old. Jeez this guy is a legend.
depois de um longo inverno... incrível como nunca decepcionam
Seeing them in London this year! Can’t wait! Dream come true! Love RHCP!! ❤️❤️
No disrespect to anyone but this is the RHCP I missed. When Frusciante's harmonies came in, man.
Una rottura che non avrei pensato si sarebbe più risanata. E invece,dopo 20 anni e per la terza volta, John Frusciante torna e i rhcp sono di nuovo grandi.
Woot? This is like avengers assembling but better since not fiction
Red Hot Chili Peppers ❤️🌶️
Senhores, vocês não sabem a falta que fizeram. Welcome back, John. ♥️
My feels really ;_____; best song ever♥️♥️♥️♥️
No busquen espectativas. Solo disfruten de la banda que esta hace 3 decadas con nosotros.
❤🇦🇷❤🇦🇷❤
Wow..
Какие они прекрасные!!!Великая группа!
Que alegría me ha dado ver otra vez a Jhon Frusciante
Esses 4 juntos não tem pra ninguém, o que o John acrescenta ao RHCP não tem explicação, músico espetacular, solo foda e um backing vocal que não tem palavras ! Red Hot é FODA 🤟🏻🎸🔥
Valeu a pena esperar , já é uma das minhas favoritas 💞
Yeah love it 🤙 good work fellas
LONG LIVE ROCKKK!! THAT FRUSCIANTE  TONE THO😍🔥
Welcome back!❤ 🔥
От души!! 👍🙏
Geile Nummer!
They are back!!!! Not to mention Anthony’s dope haircut!
John Frusciante!!! ❤️
Will Ferrell's still got it on the drums!
I've been waiting for a long time and it was worth the wait. It's a beautiful song with John's guitar and backing vocals, Anthony's soothing voice, Flea's bass and Chad's great energy. Welcome back John, welcome back RHCP with John.  Greetings from Turkey. 🤘🇹🇷
TEMAZO
Some things never changes. Thanks god.
I love this so much. This song gives me By The Way era vibes. Josh Klinghoffer is amazing and he did so much for the band, but these four guys belong together. They are the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
❤🇮🇹🤗
Thanks rhcp for making us happy again😊
Amazing
Esperei muito por esse dia ❤️
i've been waiting for new album for almost 6 years since they released the getaway and i'm sooooooooooo excited because this song has the energy that i need for now
chi come lorooo
I can't wait for the new album ❤️
i love you guys
YESSS YESSS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \m/
I never digged much RHCP but I loved some Frusciante's solo work back in days (especially Niandra Lades and Smiles from Streets you hold). Looks like he didnt aged at all 😲
generic, middle of the road and boring. this got old 20 years ago lads.
Eu estava aqui no lançamento!☺️
Today is a good day!
I have no words. Just thank you for being  such a beautiful humans. This took me back in my memoria, and you're still here. Thanks, thanks, thanks. You're true Friends making music with love. That's how you teach me how to truly means making music. Since 2006.
Oohhh dude can't wait to hear this live....John frusciante back right where he left..same shirt....same hairs....same chemistry and unique talent... undoubtedly one of the best guitarist of all time....soo happy he's back and can't wait for the album to drop!! RHCP are back!
Frusciante, YOURE GONNA MAKE IT BRAHHH!!!!!
Nothing better than waking up with this notification, this band is the best
Finally .....
Boa demais! Essa música é em homenagem ao pai do Kieds, que faleceu ano passado!
Typical RHCP with very easy guitar during verses and generic chorus. The song is based on the contrast between calm verses and more energetic choruses. I wish Navarro never left this band years ago. It could have been much more diverse and interesting than this.
Thanks for this guys! 😭❤️
SEVILLA 2022 ♥️
Los quiero mucho ♡
Absolute banger.
Honestly not one of my favorite RHCP songs, but John's part is excellent. He shines above the rest of the song.
John is BACK!!!!!!!!!!
This is even better than Abba comeback (sorry Swedish friends) ... GREAT SONG.
Boring simple song. The solo is really good though, uplifting the general atmosphere. Hope the album will be better
Es que me va a dar algo <3
Cool
Omg I'm so excited for this new album
Música maravilhosa!!!! Que vibe! Sensacional! John está de vooolta!!!!
Chhyyynnahh  is on the Dark Side of the Moon : quote by  - Trump
Jesus Christ, John! Still can't believe he is back!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Welcome back!!
Magnifique, plus les années passent et plus votre musique résonne fort... très fort!!! ❤🤘🤘🤘🌼
Has anyone noticed at 0:28 there's a little drum twitch or dunno the word..but it stops there.
Liebe Grüße aus Deutschland.
Obrigado por voltar John Frusciante. O exodia está formado novamente.
fantastic guitar 🤟
Anthony Keidis pulled off his best Eddie Guerrero look here
In terms of returning again this is the Scar Tissue for the new generation.
The Chorus is like Ballad of Dwight Fry
Lets go!
Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea! Flea!
Esse som é simplesmente incrível! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Aquela essência que faltava do John
john's guitar intro is gold
I cant put into words how happy new chili peppers music with John makes me. This is amazing. It sounds different, yet still sounds like the chili's! Also has a sort of Janes Addiction feel to it, which does not dissapoint. Cant wait for the album, & the tour!
sempre surpreendendo!!@
Как всегда ,,ПЕРЦЫ,,  бесподобны и уникальны! Любовь навсегда!
Always nice hearing new RHCP
I can't even describe the feeling that John's guitar playing gives me, just pure joy.
I love you guys
That was brilliant. Thank you, gentlemen.
at least everyone who got him/herself a Mohawk back in 2000,  should go for Mullet right now!! :D
Have been a die hard fan since 89, still love every song! The band with the gift to give you a smile and energy!
🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥....
The family reunion 💜🎵
Furgasm 😍😍
JOHN FRUSCIANTES REALLY BACK WHOOO
EU AMO VOCÊS VSF
RHCP forever ♥
The Frusciante's "AHs" are back!!
Bratislava 2022!
A truly Masterpiece 💜
Excellent
We made it, kids. The boys are back fr
I don't like it very much, it's a bit predictable & flat
WILL FERRELL!!!
Hit!!!
what a day to be alive!
Is this real?
Sonoridade bem "Stadium Arcadium". Rick Rubin não mentiu em suas declarações! Vamos ver como será o restante do disco...
They back
🐐
Massa👏👏👏
It's 3am and I can't sleep but that's OK because I can listen to this all night.
The opening gives me chills, RHCP banging out tunes again 🤘
Anthony still have great ripped body as always and still is the best of the best in the music industry. Hail to Anthony Kiedis.
That Guitar was given to JK by JF and it's now back
Love it!!!!!!!!!
RHCP forever
Good to see John again :)
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I've been waitinggggggg
Era el eslabón que faltaba..
Stadium Arcadium (Bonus track) 🥰
Dream of California......
Oh my fucking GOD!!!!!!! I've been feeling so close to the sun in this last days and then the first new song released by my favorite band it's has a lots os sun on it!!! We are synchronized ❤️🌞 I loved the song!! Aaaaaaaaa got emotional a few times 🙃❤️🌞
so glad that john is finally back,miss his sound..rhcp4ever💘
💯
Yesssss…..finally they’re back 😭
Waiting on another black summer to end.
I love it, I feel a lot of Stadium Arcadium and Californication here. But to be honest, Dark Necessities or Rain Dance Maggie are not less of a good single compared with this one.
The Boys are back in town.
Nothing specially. Video is great, but sooooong.....hm, nope. I expected more from this guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_038vBw9-zw  Mullet!!!!
I swear, they sound like home ❤
The 3rd coming of Jesus!! 🤘🔥
KINGS ARE BACK!
Welcome Back ♥🇮🇹
I love you rhcp ❤️
It's like they never left, I'm so happy
It's very delightful see this 4 guys rocking again! Long live RHCP, long live John Frusciante!! 🎸🎛️🔥
John is so godly
Good to see you guys again!!!
Hi.. John...
How the clocks of time roll along, so fast it's gone by. I remember when my sister bought Blood Sugar Sex Magik but it wasn't 1991, we were very young then. It was more like PS1, Eminem time. I was only maybe 9 years old but I was just getting into music after receiving my first real hi-fi system with Gale speakers, a CD player & an amp with an equaliser. My first album was Intergalactic by the Beastie Boys. my sister was getting more into rock & she loved RHCP & The Smashing Pumpkins. I would play Resident Evil 1 whilst she listened to rock bands. I miss the 90's, such an epic decade, especially for music & the revolutionary consoles, internet.
Hit the like button before I heard it!!!
..and your sound is back intact! <3
Keren..🖒🖒🖒
I love it 🧡🧡
カッコイイ！！！  最高！！！！
THANK YOU. Amazing! 🤩
Moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ce retour, quel bonheur !! :)
Что не говори, а с Джон  Фрушанте группа обретает свой неповторимый саунд 🤟🤟🤟
13 years of waiting
Os caras nunca erram
RHCP are getting weird.  Trying a bit too hard be like they way they were decades ago.  Aging and maturing is ok guys.  Allow yourself to be yourself.  No one expects you to be 20 all your life.
good stuff, you can tell it was recorded in jam house n.3
Frusciante ❤️
Ohhh these guys are amazing,still rocking with rhcp taste
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, waiting for another rhcp album to land.
Bom demais ver a formação clássica de volta! Gostei da música,ansioso para o álbum completo!
Ahh man, what a great song! The sound of RHCP is back with this one. My nostalgia drives are in full force thinking back to listening tracks like Slow Cheetah while I did my paper round back in 2006
Will Ferrel looking as good as ever
Seems like an here comes the sun remixed by them
2022 um ano mágico com esse lançamento maravilhoso. ❤️  Será um álbum espetacular. 😍🤘🏿
<3333
RHCP <3
Beautiful song…Thank you. It’s always amazing how your emotions can respond to music, the frequency of the notes produce a physical effect in your body. That first solo break just swept through deep. Thanks Chaps ❤️
yes!!! JOHN FRUSCIANTE!! 😭😭😭😭😭
It’s just so nice to hear RHCP
John is back! - always makes me want to pick up my guitar again when I hear his unique sound - Cant wait for the tour this summer!
No pierden el toque estos cabrones 👌
Can't wait for full album. Great as always. Keep rockin'!
The same shit
Good to the whole family back together! I am crying so much! Thank You Guys!
Absurda a música
VIVA LA FRUSCIANTE🌶
is this sad song? why my tear drop too much
respect
Thank you for healing all my Scars Tissues.  You knew my mind You knew my kind You knew that Dark Necessities are part of my design. But you show me that I Can’t Stop. You show me how to take it on the Otherside, reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue, Give it Away now. Thank you for learning me how to fly away on my Zephyr, so I feel this Black Summer more then ever. ❤️‍🔥🌶🔥 Forever loving you ALL @chilipeppers !!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Melhor banda ,meu deus 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

John puts the RED HOT IN CHILI PEPPERS my favorite guitarist
Gracias RHCP 🥲
Amazing

Excelente tema, te extrañaba mucho Frusciante, es bueno tenerte de vuelta, los amo RHCP.
When your favourite band releases a new song on your birthday, definitely gonna be a good day, thanks for the gift guys 🤗
Thank you RHCP I’ll be listening to this all day now
Como queria que estivesse aqui hoje meu irmão pra poder acompanhar esta musica comigo. Infelizmente nos a 2 dias e deixa um grande vazio no meu coração. 😥
Simplesmente insanos!  🌶🌶🌶🌶
Finally after 6 years waiting, Chili Peppers realease theri new song. Frusciante back to the line up and give his signature guitar notes and tunes. And also makes the whole band makes different sound compare to their last 2 album with Klinghoffer.   This songs reminds me the old sound that band had in the album 'By The Way' and 'Stadium Arcadium'.  Spefically, 'Black Summer' reminds me with 'Desecration Smile' on the 'Stadium Arcadium' album. It has the same drum beat and song texture but different guitar sounds and notes.  RHCP is my favourite band since i was in junior high school with By The Way songs and the whole album itself. Greetings from Jakarta. Please have a concert here. Love you always guys
I never thought getting on can be so graceful
RHCP are the best ever !!!!
I just woke up and this is the first thing I see and hear..... what a freakin perfect amazing day!!!! thanks guys for gifting us great music for decades 🎸❤
John❤
didn't sleep today because needed to study and was blessed with this, feels like a reward
🇵🇭
Eu amo RHCP 🥰❤️😍
Fuck, absolutamente todos pensamos que esta rola es la esencia pura de la banda
Pqp, que música linda, os caras simplesmente entregaram tudo!!!!
Viva a vida! Oportunidade de ouvir os tiozões pimentas bagaçando em mais um lançamento!
Thank you
YEESSSSS
Meu Deus ..... Ansiosa demais pra ouvir esse single. Amooooo muito vocês.... LOVE RHCP
There got older but their vibe and presence is the same. Frusciante is my favourite modern guitarist that inspired me to learn guitar more. Love this song
JOHN!
Great   Suzano - São Paulo - Brasil  04/02/2021

Frusciante's guitar tone on fleek like forever
❤️
meh, but nice to them enjoying themselves.
Супер!)
Great! New album, please?
Much missed chemistry
Goddamn! I haven't even listened to Peppers in months, been on a Funkadelic binge the past week or so and just thinking about Clinton and Bootsy, Fuzzy Haskins and the rest and how if it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have the Peppers.  Tony and Flea must be getting near 60 now and they still got that funk in them and they're still going strong and giving the world so much love, and loving that very signature Frusciante guitar again ✌🌶🌶🌶
I've been here in February 4th)
Thanx from France 🥰❤️
Was a hard last week. This came out and I haven't stopped smiling since. This band spread joy like no other can. I am forever grateful for them. When family died, girlfriends left,  being broke, drug addiction took hold, friends died,  they have been there  illuminating the path when my life has been darkest.   Just Thank you.   (Also John. John.  What a musician)
Much missed chemistry
A masterpiece. I'm so glad to be part of this new era of RHCP! 🤘🏻
Que buen año para ser fan de los Peppers!!!!  🌶
🤘😄🌶
Ну ничего так. Старенькие уже конечно, но норм.
Preciosa canción, gran equilibrio de todos, una voz magnífica, batería muy Californication, bajo continuando Desecration Smile y guitarras más propias de la carrera en solitario de John. ¡Me encanta esta sintonía que se ha generado aquí!
What a time to be alive. Thank you, guys ♥️
Omg New Red Hot Chili Peppers music! Sounds like the true successor album to Stadium Arcadium 🎸😍
👽perfect as always🖤
What's with Anthony's new accent? 😂
Omggg 😍😍😍😍
Fuck yeah🤛
Наконец, повеяло прежними чилийскими перцами. А не вот это вот все ))).
LOVE YOU RHCP <3 Your music keep me alive since I was a kid <3
uhu
Curti demais esse som pra variar rsrs
here we go
amo vocês
Love the Gitarre 🎸 Play Thanks RHCP ❣
lindos
Californication 2022. Nothing new .
🤫🇧🇷😱😝🤟🏽🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Josh Klinghoffer is an amazing artist, but hearing Frusciante vocals and guitar style back in the group is such a thing .  Thanks to all of you ❤️ and can't for the album !
I cant express the sheer amount of happyness this song gives me
♪ 🎸♪ ☀ ♪ ✨ ♪
should of got rubin in on this
Anthony looks like a Frank Zappa guy(suits him very well), Flea is as mad as ever, and i´m superglad to see John again in da house. And not to forget  Chad, a real good drummer, he gave me a lot of fun tryin´ to play his beats. The song reminds me of some older Albums, but still looking forward to the new Album. Thx Peppers !
They are all in the same "frequency". And I Just connected to It right now. Gratz RHCP for the great work.
Appreciate that these guys still putting amazing effort in their masterpieces☺️♥️
Primeira música do red hot dropada em Eb?? Hahahaha
Anthony really needs to lose the mustache
Everybody talking about John, but can we appreciate how hard Chad goes on the drums here?
Welcome back Red Hot Thanks  Amazing Song!!!!!!

Grande ritorno dei RHCP! E bentornato John!!!!!
Absolutely loving the guitar. But i am not sure about this u2 like sound on anthonys voice. Sorry to say that. Maybe I should listen to it another 10 times to get used to it ....
Dam still looking strong and youthful.
As fellow Chilli's fans, I love you all. You are all great.
FRUSCIANTE WE LOVE YOU
おかえりなさい
AMAZING!

I like the song but it's time Anthony Kiedis perv white azz get prosecuted for his strange attraction to young girls allegedly
Frusciante rule
Frusciante is the only good thing here, damnit
Black Summer Lyrics [Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a tonne The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a nеw friend* Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Damn this is good.
Obrigado por isto! Beijos do Brasil! 🇧🇷
THEY ARE BACK!
Groovy as always 🤘🏼
Tanto tiempo que esperaba esto, lágrimas
God damn this is 🔥
This year is a bless. RHCP with new single. MUSE with new single.
SOS FROM ITALY  POLITICIANS ARE STOLEN OUR FREEDOM
Снова?  Всегда! Yeah
Woke up to audio yesterday and video today - feels like good old days of 2006 and 2007. Wonderful song, basically RHCP's own "Wake Me Up When September Ends", given the subject matter. And know what? John Frusciante is irreplaceable - this is not up to debate. Says who? Says I.
😆😆😆🤩🤩🤩🤩
Genius
Merci !
Boss! 👍
Californication vibes...
Perfection now that's the real music I want from them thnx John for coming back to music  life

More exciting is the release of NHC's ep, which is bloody amazing
Arrepiei
that ‘good-old’ Frusciante vocal!
Как же рад возварщениею Фурща. От песня прям напомнила альбомы By The Way, Stadium Arcadium👍👍👍👍
L'Italia oggi vi ama ancora di più. È tutto perfetto. RHCP🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
🥲🥲🥲
Me gusta la banda desde que tengo memoria, el regreso es mágico y necesario para el arte, pero no se olviden que el rock también tiene bandas modernas buscando un publico ahora que la industria no le ha dejado de lado. El confort que tienen las pocas bandas clásicas en el mundo de hoy por parte de la industria me hace pensar en el camino nulo de las bandas que no tienen ese musculo de difusión.
I've been looking forward to this
Good to see John back and kicking ass
I love them. I always will! Absolute legends in every sense! Thankful they're still giving us music!
so many years passed but the pepper is still red, hot and chilli.
Yaaaaas
Pop band and Pop music 🤔😒
I’ve been waiting……this is a cool tune……ROCK N ROLL 🎸🤘
'China's on the dark side of the moon' 'sailin on our censorship, riding on a headless horse to make the trip'????? Lezzzzgo! Not only are they back but maybe they wont shill out for the death cult 🤞🤙🤙
Que canção hein pessoal! Eles nos surpreende como sempre, nós fãs agradecemos pelo presente! Vida longa a banda, vocês são FODA! Viva RHCP! 🤘🏻🎸🎼😍🙏
my 90s eardrums vibin!!!
I ❤️ RHCP
FINALLY
🔥🔥🔥
おぉっ⁉️‼️
I heard: “And China’s on the dirt side of the moon” :)))
I just love your essence, the things you four can create, this is just amazing, such a pleasure to hear new things from you four! NOW COME TO BRAZIL IMMEDIATELY 😤😤😤 BELLORY HILLS (AKA BELO HORIZONTE) IS WAITING !
Parabéns pela música red hot, amo vocês
Man this is a good tune.i can't wait to hear the album. I'll prob talk about it here on my Chanel since I'm returning from hiatus ad music is gunna e a direction I go

Nice to see Iggy pop and RHCP collab!😆😆
They got it. 🔆⚡️
Is it too late to be a fan?
La misma energía legendaria de los Red Hot !! Es impresionante cómo a través de los años siguen con la misma esencia de siempre. 🖤❤️
I love you guys, welcome back!! You are forever young, and I am also young with you!!
Хренотень, давно выдохлись эти старички
that guitar tone...
Esse som acaba se tornando nostálgico com essa volta, sentimento bom.
Delivers as usual:) greetings from Finland 🇫🇮
JOHN FRUCIANTE 🙌🏻
Larga vidaaa a los Red Hot❤️
Another Banger !! Thanks Boys !
Gracias por transportarme a esa época de los 2000’s que buenos recuerdos con la banda y qué sonido tan particular. Larga vida a los peppers. Nos vemos en junio en Barcelona!🙏🏻
So good to see John Frusciante back again ❤️
frusciante' vibes are backkkkkkk
God bless Red Hot!
I wonder why Anthony went with all of those hard R sounds? Not what I was expecting, still great though :D
There once was a ship that put to sea.  The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea...
Californication vibes! goosebumps 🥰
Ahhhhhh mano, como é bom ver o Frusciante no lugar que sempre o pertenceu!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Whoa what time is that insane
🤯🤯🤯
Até que enfim ligaram os auto falantes pro guitarrista tocar kkkkk top demais
Довгих років RHCP!
Jonn!
I wish I was so shredded like Tony is at 59. Awesome song lads!
And they’re back with a bang! ☄️🔥
I was making a pick up ( I do deliveries on my bike ) when they released this song at 10pm. I was waiting for the food at the restaurant and I immediately click on the video. It maked me so happy, work was hard but suddenly it wasn't hard. Or maybe this song made me realize that should be hard sometimes. That's the red hot chili peppers.
John's solo was amazing. Soul and expression
❤️AMAZING❤️ RHCP 4ever
RHCP 101... 🔥🔥🔥 A few times, the song gave me chills! Thanks!
2022 sempre atual absoluto
s
man this is good
❤️❤️❤️
nothing special, nothing new. average
Thank you john frusciante
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
MEU DEUS DO CEUUUUU ❤❤❤❤
After so many years of great music, this just shows you never lose it 👏🏻
🥰
Soft rock is back again!
So we're all ignoring the mullet, right?
My soul needed this, thank you gentlemen.
Wtf 😂 ohh man sorry
Love it!!
Frusciante just gives this band their sound. Josh was amazing, but John is the heart and soul of this band. I can't express how happy I am that he's back. This new song is amazing and I cannot wait for Unlimited Love to come out this April.
👍👍👍👍👍
В моем сердце песня
Just me who think it looks like Anthony is trying too look like the tiger king? 😅
Felicidad absoluta!
Thank God for giving us the RED HOT CHILI FUCKING PEPPERS
Sem palavras..... show de mais..
Californication vibes !
They're back 🤩
Hard to say, but I'm not feeling it. I'll wait for the other sixteen songs, before I judge
Muero de amor
💕❤💘💕🎶🎵❤🎼💕💘🎶🎵🎼🎼🎧🎶💕💘🎶🎧🎼🎶🎶💕💘🎶🎵🎼🎵❤😘🇧🇷
wow I just need to get this off my chest real quick. I‘ve been listening to the chili peppers for over 10 years since I was a little child, basically grew up with blood sugar $ex magik, and their music literally gives me life, I‘m so grateful for them to keep going and I really really love this song!!❤️❤️
So brilliant!! Love this tune! Great to see and hear Frusciante back! Totally back on form✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻😎
Ese riff suena como algo nuevo en el mundo de la guitarra cosa que no se ha visto en años. Solo podía venir de un king como John  Frusciante.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥
Grandi per sempre 💯💥💫👍👁👁
really looking forward to unlimited love greetings from morocco
Great to see you all together once again I like this song love you RHCP enjoy you're tour
Great to have Frusciante back, ofc, but why nobody's saying that Will Farrell is on drums?
Return of the king. Never thought I'd live to see this band back together this way. Love you John.
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why all guitars in this video are unplugged? It looks really unnatural
That was HOT , like RHCP HOT 🔥🤘🌶️
after 16 years 😭😭😭
Welcome back!
Thank you for this
I couldn't listen to RHCP while josh was there. They even came to my city to play but wasn't bothered to go see them since the magic was not there. Can't wait for the album to come and for the summer to go watch them. Tbh I don't even mind travelling to see THE red hot chili peppers! And I promise I'll be jamming my air guitar during every song and singing. John is god 🙏
Great!
This is so good!
Wow!
they are always wonderful.🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
I just lost it guys
Increíble ver a los 4 de nuevo juntos !!! Y a Anthony moviéndose como siempre por el escenario. Increíble las partes de Frusciante tocando ❤️❤️❤️
Miss you so much RHCP
So fuckin' beautiful guys,, as simple and intense as l hoped it would be! Welcome back MY LIFE ❤🌶  See you next summet!

RHCP FOREVER
❤️🇬🇷❤️🇬🇷❤️🇬🇷
John's backing vocals take me back to the old songs and I couldn't be happier. Many thanks, guys! We've been waiting for you and it feels so good to have you back ❤
Quixoticelixer's reflection.
This better trend to number 1 wow what a way to start our Friday
This upcoming album will be better than the last, guaranteed
Vintage Chillies. Anyone know why Kiedis is doing that Irish/Sea Shanty twang?
Been waiting for this moment so many years. It's finally here!
Kemosiooooooonnnn ❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍
Ya los extrañaba con su música, espero con ansias verlos en los escenarios, mi banda favorita..
Oooooh! Wow, it’s so fucking good to see John back with them ♥️
I love that after all these years nothing changed including Anthony shirtless as always .                                                     Rock on mates,  forever the best!
Great to see Will Ferrell on drums!!!
It's as if John never left the band.  Amazing!  👏👏
Happy to see Kiedis taking some vocal inspiration from the island boys.
wtf ?!?!? John Frusciante is back ?!! wow!  didn't know...... this is awesone !
Coisa mais lindaaa🔥😍 saudade desses 4!
Not bad, but it's a bit too safe. Where's the funk?
Ahhhhhhhhhh me vengooooo
Oh my god it's like forgetting the past 15 years and travelling back to the golden age of RHCP. Not saying that everything was bad with Josh but damn, welcome back John 🙏🏻♥️♥️
#SoberDadRock ❤️❤️❤️
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I need Anthonys diet and fitness plan.
AMEI AMEI. ❤️
So damn happy I’m seeing them in Nashville soon!
JOHN FRUSCIANTE! THE RETURN OF THE KING!
Waited for this for so long and can’t wait album to be out for sale.  See you guys in Budapest ❤️🤘
I love you John
Yep 😍😍📿
🔥🔥🔥
best thing here is the guitar work !
Спасибо, ребята!
Welcome back, RHCP!
WELCOME BACK JOHN FRUSCIANTE!!!!!!
I m very happy for this thank you
и Ленин такой молодой
John fuckin Frushante
Thanks to influence my whole life❤ and john you're magical
Frusciante still amazing
Anthony's been listening to too many sea shantys.
As I am exited for every new song I am also exited for Antonys new hair cut! Thx guys for be part of my Life
I'm glad to see Frusciante !!
Excellent sound. Can't wait for the tour/Album.
Soy fanatico de oasis desde hace años y los red hot fueron una banda aparte de mis preferencias, pero hace 3 años comence a apreciar mas su musica y viendo que mi banda favorita no volvera mas desde 2009, me hace feliz que los red hot mas populares se hayan reunido para lanzar un nuevo disco. No importa si en unos años mas no trabajan juntos. El hecho de que una banda sea lo suficientemente madura para darle una alegria a sus fans de toda la vida dice mucho y en ese sentido, los red hot son mucho mas maduro que muchas bandas que se pelean incluso sin reconciliarse.
Come on RHCP are back on their top level with John being back in the band, can't wait for the album to come out
look kids real musicians playing real music.
I love it. The excellent decision to use southern inflection on the vocals in certain spots made it very cerebral. This had tons of emotion in it. Again, love it.
Bıyıkları kessene antony
JUST. THE. FUCKING. BEST.
Good to hear John back and Anthony finally embracing his pirate heritage.
Yessssssss !!!!!! Yessssssss !!!!!!! Yesssssss !!!!!!!
Wellcome back John!
Grande Frusciante
Amo minha banda. ❤️❤️❤️
Деды💔🥲
espectacular cancion y video
bit of a let down , some fan work after the teaser was much more exciting
Will Ferrell on the drums is great as always
スバラシイ！！！！
What a breath of fresh air they are! 🖤
I just woke up and what a surprise. I fell like I'm 13 again and just discovered their music. 😇
It sounds perfect
Watched this when the YouTube "views" counter for this video was at 160,598 on the 4th of February, 2022. Wonder how many views it will have by tomorrow (let alone 10 years from now)... And, I wonder how many of those views will be mine.
RHCP on top
Keeping the dream alive 👊
THE REAL HOT CHILI PEPERSS, CONGRTASS JOHN
I’ve been waiting….. for this. Amen hallelujah feels like home.
John Motherfuckin' Frusciante, let's fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Все мы скучали по этому бэк-вокалу и гитаре Джона!
Sounds great!
เอาไปเลย 2 นิ้วโป้ง
THE GOAT IS BACKK!!!!!! And damn such a great tune to be back with. It's a classic!
hearing the sound of strat with a subtle chorus effect played by john never disappoints. Can't wait for the album!!!
How starting a good day 😍😍😍
Missed you n love you 💜💜💜thought to myself... I wonder when the next Chili 🌶️ Pepper 🫑 song will come out... Dude! THREE HOURS AGO... Brah...
John is back!!!!!!!!!!
they make me so happyyyyy
1:50 John first solo ! His first note, took me deeper and depeper
Just a reminder that Anthony is nearly 60! He looks 20 years younger
Sounds like a song that was rejected from a album in the 90's
RHCP returns!!!!
From Russia with love!
I hope there will be an extended version
Esa guitarra suena a Hey baby de Jimmy Hendrix increíble
HYPE HYPE HYPEEEEEE❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Instant classic
Essa música não sai da minha cabeçaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Glad to be here
ох, Господи, какой чудесный день!!! У этого мира ещё есть шанс, если у нас такая музыка! Ребята, вы - свет и добро! Спасибо за любовь! Джон, с возвращением домой ❤️❤️❤️🌶️
To think the last time these 4 released new music was stadium arcadium in 2006.  Were privileged to hear them again 14 years later, they are definitely the soundtrack to my life...
Vamos los red hot 🇨🇴
My boi Anthony came back with the irish accent🤘😂
This song is everything I wanted it to be - you bunch of legends
So glad to see keanu reeves back on the guitar!
This feels way to good!
😍
Don't get me wrong, I love most of what RHCP has put out... but that was terrible.
As soon as the intro starts it is that familiar guitar tone, like a warm blanket or a greeting from an old friend. Welcome back John and what a way to announce your return 👍 This is a classic.
Josh was a great guitarist but it's really good to see John back
It's so red hot!
I was waiting for that wideo a lot of time and song is great!
La estoy escuchando ebrio y juro que es tremenda joya, arriba los RHCP!!!
what a sound!
Nice, after all these years mannn
1:52 The same Highway from Brand E John Frusciante Video
Damn,this band just gets better after time,as most should,but John's back,oh shit it's on now man...
Танцы с голым торсом в 60 - RHCP!
Long live Peppers!
NEW RHCP CONTENT🔥🔥
I wake up and I see this. Loved it!
they are back!
mantab ngab
Back into Stadium Arcadium, great work!
This just made my entire year. These guys are timeless and will never cease to make amazing music.
This video deserves more views! 💪🏻
You can take me now Lord.. after 15years of waiting.. I’m officially ready after hearing that blissful sound again 😭😭😭🌶🌶🌶
Anthony Kiedis, Joe Exotic : same energy
Keanu Reeves on guitar
April is a perfect date for the new album
Es muy fuerte, tienen casi 60 años y parece que el tiempo no pasa por ellos!
Танцы с голым торсом в 60
I've been listening to and learning from this band for the last 20 years of my life.. They've changed my life. I'm a music teacher now, and is partly because of them. They changed the direction my life took. And it's the best  that has happened to me. Just today, I came home from having started a new band with my colleagues, and found this new material from them. A true happy day indeed. Tony, Flea, Chad, John.. Keep spreading your love and wisdom. To celebrate you is greater, now that WE can. Greetings from Argentina, to all the Peppers fans around the world.
agora posso morrer em paz
Awesome! Happy to see John also! \m/
Энтони Крокус жжот т
Valio la pena esperar
Cets trop beau!!!! Les red hot in se revoit au stade de France !!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
0:45 John first appeared..
Quanto tempo esperei por isso... 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
My favorite band still making music 🔥 thank you guys
Great song! And that solo! wow
I may be really high, but this is really good.
"Black Summer"  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  🌶🟣🟡😘😘😘😘
Awesome!!! The rhcp vibe is back!
Wawww !!!! It’s just magic !!
Well. Yet another masterpiece for the books ✅❤️
Ninggalin jejak 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I can't even put my admiration for these guys into words. The music, the masterful composition of this song, and last but not least the lyrics which hit differently after 2 years of corona... The message is so poignant for me; it's quite refreshing to hear a meaningful song (or maybe it's just me not being well-versed in recent music). Like many people before me said, it feels like home to listen to John's vocals harmonising with Anthony's. As much as I liked Josh's stint with the band, there's something familiar in the sound of Fru's guitar merging with Flea's bass and Chad's drums. All the memories of my teenage years spent rocking to RHCP's music keep coming back, and I guess I won't be able to listen to anything else (AGAIN) for at least a year. Thank you, Chili Peppers!
Finally something new with good lyric writing
Stadium Arcadiumehearties!
Они вернули мой 2007ой!
21 years later and im still listening to the rhcp
You are legends! ❤️❤️❤️
I kinda thought I was going to dislike this only to find these guys grooving harder and tighter then ever with no fucks giving, bravo
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow. Feels like the first time listening to this band ❤️
😍
Stadium Arcadium vibes all over the place <3
круто, спасибо!
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the Rolling Stones of my generation. I hope they play on forever. I am 33...
With all due respect for Josh and his guitar playing...nothing compares to that classic Frusciante sound, truly a phenomenal guitar player...it's awesome to have John back
Finally! Will Farrel and Keanu Reeves reunion!
My childhood...
wahh 3 jam yang lalu, ntabss
Кайф конечно!
Kerennya parah sih
I'm sorry to disapoint someone, but this might be their best song ever \m/ This is pure ART 🤘
Wow thanks you RHCP
JOHN FRUSCIANTE?!!!!!!! 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
No other band has done it so long, so good.
Cementing their place as the U2 of funk rock here we have another Chilli Peppers snore fest. Why is Keidis singing with a fucking pirate accent. Chad still proving Lars to be a better drummer than him and Flea and John trying in vain to bring some excitement to this crap
Longa vida aos Red Hot Chilli Peppers!!!! Que sonzera em pleno verão brasileiro, cê é Loko tio!!
Their music feels like home ❤
Aw, with the intro sounding like kyuss i knew it would be different from the old stuff. Glad to have more music tho ☺️
So good to hear those signature frusciante solos again!
It is very sad to see that our favorite band are getting older 🤧 (sorry for my English grammar)
S veľkou láskou zo Slovenska 😍🇸🇰
Today just got better
Sobrevivemos ao COVID para ouvir isso 😍😍😍✨🇧🇷
❤️
ILOVEYOU WILL FERRELL!
Like it. It reminds me Californication album. A bit nostalgic sound, more rock than funky. Much more stronger guitar presence...this is the rhcp I like.
Ох как же вас не хватало. КОЧП уже давно глубоко в сердечке. Давайте, чуваки, жгите дальше и дольше!
ตำนานที่ยังมีลมหายใจ
Легенды вернулись
Already on round 6 of this
Love it, Welcome back Boys
Throw me back to mid 2000s
Yaaaaawwwn. One song, one drumbeat since '99.
Welcome home John 😎
A slow-burn grower, much like Scar Tissue was for Californication
I’ve been waiting too! It’s been a long time...
The King is back 🔥
Yeahhhhhh! <3
1:53 God I missed that sound
Sounds exactly like RHCP
God bless it. 🙌
Oh they had a new guitar player again already? Where's Josh..
Johns looking like john wick these days, good to see that og strat still kickin
" É como que a essência e a harmonia dessa banda continua se intacta"  Vida longa Red Hot 🇧🇷
Kind of amazing they made a career out of saying literal drug induced psychotic nonsense and attempting to pass it off as cryptic, insightful, or profound. Dudes are high af.
Love it! No disrespect meant to previous band members but this is RHCP and my ears are so happy to have them back ♥️
I'm crying this is perfect  That 🎸 tone made me high "I'm pickin' up good vibrations" 😎 This song is immediately an old friend  I Rep this one till the sun comes up Thank you!
Какая у John'a прическа милейшая просто.
This song grows on you
Was surprised to see you in my notifications I am happy this exists 🤘🤘
RHCP is my favorite band, and ever since John left I've felt a void and always hoped for him to come back. A few years ago, when they announced he was returning, I couldn't believe it. And today, on my birthday, they release a new single and announce a new album. I cannot express what I'm feeling right now. Thank you for being the soundtrack of my life.
Unfortunately there is black spring for Ukraine .
This song is 🔥
❤ they came back
🥳🥳♥️
THEYRE BACK THEYRE BACK THEYRE FUCKING BACK
Ok I listened to it 12! or 13 times  already. I think I like it amazing tbh
Men of culture, here we meet again 🌶🌶
Sea shanty vibes to Antony’s vocals, people dissing already, auto tune blah blah blah… just enjoy the experience! To many people quick to criticise, if you don’t like it don’t listen.  It’s not the most edgy RHCP but they aren’t that band anymore, they are older… I personally am so great full to have the 4 back together that make pure magic, John completes them.   I love it, and am growing impatient for the album… can’t wait! Watching them twice this (hopefully) JUST APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAVE. I’m certain there will be some absolute bangers on the album.
for christs sake try something new guys...
Nossa acordar já com essa música do Red Hot é  muito bom.  Como não amar essa banda.
Frusciante has been the missing sauce. The world almost seems whole again.
RIP Diego Verdaguer
hello again, old friend.
It’s three, in the morning, I’m shoveling snow and I’m now reminded why I missed John so fucking much
Californication, By the Way n Stadium Arcadium had a threesome n gave birth to this!!! Throw Blood Sugar n Mother's milk into the next one n create Station!!!!! Love you guys for life n anyone else who does also. This new song made my day!!!!!!!!
A melhor banda do sistema solar inteiro! ♥️❤️‍🔥
To hear this is the same feeling as when you meet your best friend that you haven’t seen in years
It’s amazing to see John come back and completely kill it man. Anthony looks like Joe Exotic this time round though 😂😂
💆‍♂️
Love this lineup and can’t wait to see them 7/31 at SoFi w Beck and Thundercat opening
All my favorite bands are coming back!  RHCP, Muse, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys (later this year)
VA MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS! Frusciante Is Back Baby
Johhhn Frusciante
Melhor banda de todos os tempos.
Finally with you John 🤤😍
I love how fucking ripped Anthony is
ive been waiting for this since 2016. thank you my kings
i should just be happy johns back in the band but this song is underwhelming compared to the expectations of what new material would sound like with john
Grazie. Vi stavamo aspettando 🔥🌶
fruscianteeeeeeeee!!!!!!
fakin amazin
Beautiful! Thank you John Fruciante for coming back! Fuck yeah
💜🧡💜🧡
So good to see John Frusciante back with the Peppers. I hope this is the final lineup. Great song.
FRUSCIANTEEEEEE

I really cry a little, thank you
These tamales are hot hot HOT!
I, for one, welcome our new overlord, Irish sounding Anthony Kiedis 😂
I'd bet having John back in the band is like coming across the most favorite pair of jeans you ever had in your life, then you find out they fit you even better.
Border
Feels like RHCP again, John just has that magical touch
EU AMO ESSA BANDAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. JOHN, ANTONY, FLEA, CHAD VOCÊS FAZEM ESSA PEQUENA PARTE DA VIDA SE CHAMAR FELICIDADE. ♥️

J❤️
Ese Frusciante, los cuatro otra vez together.... A todos enhorabuena guys.......🎤🎸💪👏👌🥰
AMAZING! Long live to The Chilie Peppers!
The perfect way to start the morning! 💚💚💚 This surprise made my day!
This really feels like where Stadium Arcadium left off when Josh left. Glad y’all are back together!

This is a great comeback song. Shows same old but new energy and it is great teaser for what to come - great!
Smiling with tears!!! This band runs through my veins!!! Feels so miraculous to be hearing this right now. Well done boys!!
Эмоции тупо переполняют! Восторг!!

john god
When stadium arcadium was released in 2006 there was a sense of hope in the music and vocals. This brings me a similar feeling. Just got tickets to see them this year. Thank you RHCP!
Wow, how diffrent they sound with John Frusciante in the band. Great to have him back. Looking forward to hearing the rest of the Album!
The chemistry between John’s guitar and Flea’s bass playing is unmistakable. Amazing
John Frusciante is back baby!
YOOO THATS A MASTERPIECE AFTER ALL THIS YEARS THIS IS FUCKING PERFECT 🔴⚪
I love Josh, he's done absolutely great stuff with the boys, but seeing the Chilis with John again... damn, that feels so good
JOHN
The Song.......You Know  How It Sounds, How It Smells and How It Feels <3
RHCP навсегда! Спасибо за новую музыку! за то, что вы вместе! за ваши прекрасные вибрации!
Ummm, goin 30 years now. How do we do something different and not repeat ourselves?. Anthony: How bout I sing in  a Bristolian accent? Eh?, Eh? What does everyone think? I'll sing in a Bristolian accent. Been mad to try that for years.
Frusciante Power!
DAMN this song is as if Dani California, Under the Bridge, and Wet Sand had a child, and I absolutely love it!!!
I love RHCP, but they look and sound like a bunch of old fuckers that are well and truly cooked
Amazing felling as usual. Love you guys RHCP 4ever ❤️ long live to the funk rock!
Anthony Kiddies at age 59 has a better body than me JESUS 😭
❤️
Literally sounds like a 99-07 era song. This album is going to be the best of the year!
It's good to hear Frusciante again, doing what he does best.
Wow so different and brave
Thank you guys. Your music carries a feeling to my life that I've been missing for quite a while. Thank you.
Musically tres chic but lyrically a bit copy catty. Sorry Tony!
Anthony = Iggy Pop Flea = Sting Chad = Joe Biden / Ed Harris Johnny = Johnny
..waiting on another sick album to laaand.
I am so happyyyyyyyyyyy! thank you guyssss!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
THE STRAT IS BACK
Feelin' strong Stadium Arcadium vibes
MIS PADRES SIII
มาจากประเทศไทย ชอบเพลงนี้

Tears of Joy!
we've waited so patiently <3
John 😍

Most boring band ever
john é brabo demais!! sem condições
What a fine day to have this kind of vibe
Horrific as always! Give it up guys! Blood Sugar and before is the only time this band had any balls
O H  M Y  G O D ! ! ! That's so fuck amazing...
Я дожил до этого момента!!!😭
De nuevo juntos👍👍👍👍👍
Esta cancion me transporta a la era by the way y algo de la era stadium arcadium  ¡¡🤩
So excited to see them live this summer.
Here before 100 million views. 🤘
Man John just completes this band. His chemistry with Flea Chad and Anthony can’t be replicated. Welcome Home John.
Thank you so much guys! Love it
Great to see John back! But this song is a disappointment to me :-(
Vuelvo a vivir a ver y escuchar nuevamente a Frusciante lml
Words can't explain how happy I am to hear new music from you guys, goat status
John Frusciante ❤
Yes! Yes! Yes! Video reminds me of the californication video ! John Frusciantes guitar playing is still a flaming sword cutting through time and space ! Yes!
This is unbelievable!!!
This is amazing! 😊
Ура, с возвращением, Джон!
Gracias from Espiye/Giresun city!!!!! We love you Anthony
Dr. Dre, then RHCP
im getting "by the way" vibes. imho their best album.
so sad kiedis can't sing without autotune these days any more.... takes away so much from their good sound. glad they're back though. hopefully he finds a tone, where he doesn't need auto tune in the rest of the album.
Omg a real "band" releasing "real" music in 2022.. thx for breaking the drout pepper's... real music is in short supply 🎶
It’s good to see (hear) these guys back. Hopefully we get something a bit more progressive in the LP.
NUNCA FUI TRISTE 💙🤧
What a tune cant wait to see you been along time coming  always been a fan xxx
I can't wait for new album! John is finally back!
I feel like in Asia by this video !!
How many times can I like a video??
Those firsts chords confesses John Frusciante is back
1:12 we call it subtility
I love them ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 🥲
John is back with a bang 👊🏻👊🏻 can’t wait for the new album. 🕉🙏🏻❤️
John ti amo❤️🌶️
this is the way 🤤
I fucking love it. So many years, style may be different, but this freaky styley energy still intact ^^
Frusciante - yes!!! All the rest is a piece of shit, sorry.
Why does Kiedis sound like a pirate though?
After 16 years a new album from rhcp!! Cool!!
this notification saved my day! always a great feeling to hear a new rhcp track!
I loved Josh Klinghoffer's playing while was with them and hate that they just cut him, but John came back like he never left on this one! This sounds exactly like a Stadium Arcadium follow up. I feel like I discovered a lost B-side track but its new and there's gonna be more!!
Amazing band and killer bass 😎
Yeahhhhhh
amo a john
Que música maravilhosa , que banda !!!!! ❤️
Well ladies and gentlemen, here we go
Hey hey heeeey 🤍🇬🇪
And..THEY'RE BACK! It's like it's 2002 again.

Udara baru dari suasana mencekik
Omg my legends are singing I am 16 and I always heard them sing every morning and night I will always be a big fan I always wanted to see them in real life 😓
Anthony, we love ya brother but get rid of that cheesy mustache.
Caralho que soooooooooom
Caraaaca, RHCP nunca decepciona!! Curti demais
dream reunion rhcp  line up anthony keidis flea chad smith 'john frusiante'
I missed that guitar, the harmonies and collective spirit. Welcome back John, welcome back Chilis
Anthony rocking the WCW Eddie Guerrero look now?
People reacting like this is so good like no shet they have the best guitarist on earth, the best bassist on earth and the best drummer on earth and Anthony is the most iconic singer on Mars
What are the words??? Did he say Any bad words  It's John's classic style
I feel sorry they let Josh go but John is just meant to be with the guys.
greAT JOHN
Pedazo de canción!!! Para las personas que quizás no esperaban una canción así, solo les puedo decir que disfruten y mucho porque nadie esperaba un retorno así🙏🏻
Omfg 😭
Guys just keep putting it out!Keep it up boys!We need this!❤
Is this a sea shanty?
Honestly this shouldn't be happening, but it is And that's a great feeling
This comes at the perfect time in my life - a fresh breeze of energy
My body is ready !
eaaaaaa
I just like the rhythm that they always had since the beginning, I hope see you guys personally one day, singing the olds songs too haha <3
The best Band of the world... 👍
Son increíbles♥️ Please come to Argentina 🙌
🤘⚡️🤘✨✨✨✨
Waiting for this for years
They look so at peace with their music again
boring
как всегда заебись!
f it, bein old aint so bad, im psyched for the rest of my life after watchin this
Hearing the first minute of Johns sweet guitar and seeing this video with John playing guitar in front of that backdrop gave me some serious Under the Bridge flash backs, as it reminded me very much of that video where he pretty much does the same. It feels good to have him back!
I have seen John playing that guitar for years, its iconic. What is it?
I was first Holmes
can’t wait for the concert 🤣
Llorar de felicidad
Definitely worth the wait.    Feels Surreal seeing them playing together again.
Old, great, The Bestest men!!! I love you, your music, your performances, shows, energy... And it is amazing. But i have one plea for you!!! Please make the full version of this Great song - (Don't Fear) The Reaper. Like on this show  https://youtu.be/0uBOtQOO70Y
Me flipa. Me plipa John de nuevo en la formación. Me flipa su solo y me flipa la canción. Está en el pack de las que me gustan desde la primera vez que las escucho
The sounds are right but the words are all wrong.. nice try.
The autotune is way too distracting. Cut that shit out.
FINALMENTE
Frusciante 😍
Grandi!
WE WANT CHILI WILLIE!!!!!
what a fuckin beautiful song, welcome back John
🥰,,,,,now it sounds  and looks right,,,,,well done guys.nailed it again
He's back, they're back 💘 I feel sorry for Josh, but I mean, John is part of the essence of RHCP
Amazing comeback and no mention of California!
Frusciante 😎
This puts a giant stupid grin on my face.   Already waiting on the Nikola tabs bc I'm too dumb to transcribe on my own
Can't wait for the other half of the double A side, called White Mountain side
사랑해요
My favorite ones, rocking the hell out of me
Thanks for your music guys.
THIS IS SOOOO EXCITING!!!
That's an instant hit!
THE BOYS ARE BACK LET'S GOOO!!! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Anthony Kiedis has sugar daddy material 🔥
Long live to Frusciante. LONG LIVE TO RHCP.
❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️
Obrigada por serem tão incríveis e intensos, eu esperei muito por esse momento! amo vocês ❤✳
Age passes for everyone, that's for sure but music keeps young and fresh.
The universe is back to normal John is back
It’s good to see Will Ferrel back in action.. Hell yeah Gator
So the 70s porn stash is making a comeback...?
Anthony: "I've been waitin, i've been waitin..."  Us: "I feel u bro, i feel u..."
THEY STILL MAKING INCREDIBLE MUSICS
Thanks! It sounds like true, can't wait to the live show and the full album!
I love the music for that ❤ THANK YOU !
John Frusciante man… good to see them back together again
LEZGO
The sheer joy of listening to a new song by John, Flea, Anthony and Chad for the first time. I haven't felt that ecstatic in a long time c":
Song's a bit disappointing, but i really enjoyed John's solos
This day just got so much better, i‘m laying ill at home with covid and this just put a big smile on my face! Thank you guys, you four always have a special effect on me, i love you and i‘m excited for the new record!
Thank you

0:47 I’ve never been so excited to see a scratched chunk of wood

welcome back John!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The great and New begining of the same rhcp i cant wait to break that repeat boton, i am really happy, after so many years i see that work in this group i love it and everyobe Who is reading this i wish the same <33
Los amo rhcp, ustedes me elevaron cuando me sentía de lo mas bajo en la escuela. Ustedes me salvaron, y los tendré siempre en mi corazón   ❤
Not to burst anyone's bubble but the song is ok.. an album track at best and why does he pronounce words like "dark" like a drunk Irish man??
Anthony sounds like an Irish sailor, the song sounds almost exactly like a dozen other RHCP songs, but it's great to see them playing together again, & really great to hear John's soloing
Peppas Forevas💛❤️
Volvió el hijo pródigo a casa..
LOS AMO LA CONCHA DE MI VIEJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
АХЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕТЬ
Not liking this song at all. Why does Kiedis sound funny? What’s wrong with his voice
F*CK I LOVE THIS!
Damn, I cried, this is amazing.
My heart is happy. Awesome 👏🌶🌶🌶
Love it, love it, love it. You guys are awesome
https://youtube.com/channel/UCJ70ok7brrFqMzr_878hO7g

GOD DAMN IT'S NICE TO SEE ALL FOUR OF THEM AGAIN! :)
Incrível! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I really missed this kind of guitar. I didn't say josh is bad, but THIS IS WHAT I WANNA HEAR
20 years back we were dependent on audio tapes and tv to listen to them. And now fresh track available anywhere in the world within minutes. But the magic remains the same! Lived it all \m/
Que alegría , no puedo ni dormir. Estuve esperando este momento, Gracias Gracias !!!
Lyrica
so happy to see john back 🥲
Welcome back John!.....
Their songs sounds all the same. Nothing new
Thanks for being mediocre!
Поют хорошо, но ничерта не понятно, лабухам из Екб! Придётся кавер на русском запилить RHCP--ToP!!!!
Simplicidade lindo eles estão perfeitos top

Guitar Hero is back 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
♥️♥️♥️♥️
hey
心待ちにしておりました！ジョンのギターがさらにパワーアップして帰ってきた感じが嬉しい！アンソニーのリリックも冴えてる。フリーとチャドもいつも通り最高！最後の4人集まるところ、胸熱ですね！ from japan
I'm waiting for my own black summer to end
I guess no one has listened to anything before 1991 because no one is stating the obvious  They have just gotten older because that's what people do Anthony isn't  the same singer And I don't think people really know anything about them before under the bridge broke them into the masses Like completely different lyrics and style Trust me I have been a fan since the 80's and started getting tattoos because of Anthony  True Men don't kill coyotes Why don't you love me like you used to do I want to party on your p****ssy
feels like its californiacation again <3 what a song <3 goosebumps when john came up
They're back! Love it!!!
John bringing them back to the stadium arcadium  days, cant wait to hear the whole album!
You guys can't realize how much I've been waiting for this. And here we are, after all these years it's like they were never separated by life. Everyone feels at home now ❤️
Настоящий кайф! Фрушанте вернулся❤️❤️❤️👍😎
Hell yeah! Was not expecting this. Nice work!!!
I'll be waiting for them in L.A #RHCP
Missed this feeling so much
This is the happiest day of my life in so many years
So so good to see these guys back!!!!! We needed this………THANK YOU!
This song just made me teary eyed nice to see John back! Lots of love from the Philippines!
I love how this is total oldschool classic Red Hot sound - just doing their own style with no new freakin trends and weird stuff. Just 90s again. Brilliant.
Welcome back to your family John Frusciante! So happy to hear your guitar playing again!
Божественно ❤️👍
Yesssssssssss!!!
Why was Anthony at jeffrey epstein island?
This album is going to bring the old essence of the chili peppers! Thanks to Frusciante
Lmao! Me gold me gold
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
ずっと待ってました😆
Got my predictions how it might sound like^ Check out if ur curious
💚💜❤💞😈😇🙏✌😎
This is my jam!!!
Ye it's not that good. I just dont really like the vocals and the lirycs, but Jhon sounds cool az always.
Como  é bom ouvir um son assim do red hort em  tempos que nada  mas faze  sentindo olha só  a obra d arte que os cara lansa obg viva o rock
This part of my life, this little part is called happiness! 😍🥰😃  #Johnisback #rhcp
ジョンが映った瞬間に涙出てきた
tears in my eyes.... thank you guys, Flea, Anthony, John, Chad, John, Chad Anthony, Flea, Anthony, Chad, Flea, John, .. in whichever order always in my heart as one!
FRUSCIANTEEEEE💗
omg.. CHILLS .. Literal CHILLS <3
Sounds even better now John is in the video...
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Master of the Stratocaster is back!
I'm soo excited to see u together with John ❣️🌶️
Real RHCP👍
Been waiting so long for this
John is rocking the John Wick look too! Fuck I love this band
Frusciante is Back!!
The boys are back in town ♥️
Guys, we are looking forward to seeing you in Russia!
the best thing that could happen this time
Wow... They look fukin ridiculous 😂😂
You guys are back ....
♥️🌶
You are fire guys!
John is back everybody 🤘
Oooh, thank you so much guys and welcome back! I love you!
Welcome back John
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Can’t believe John made me wait 16 years for this shite, I hope this is one of the duds off the album
It’s nice hearing John back but is their any reason Anthony is doing his best best Madarin from Iron Man 3 impression whilst singing? Not great on first impressions but perhaps it’ll grown on me.
This left me feeling completely indifferent. Other than the laughs I got from Anthony singing like an idiot and still not being able to get over his own body, I will forget this along with all the music they have made since stadium arcadium.....sad
Shit song. Horrible singing, stupid lyrics, music does nothing, goes nowhere.
Love from Algeria 🇩🇿
Thank you
Yes boys. Welcome BACK! Unlimited ❤️ for you. X
LARGA VIDA A FRUSCIANTE
I'm so freaking in love with this Band! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🔥🔥🔥🔥 The Infinite Love they have for each other is unbelievable! John I've waited all my life to see you! 😍😍😍😍😍
Vida eterna a los RHCP... WELCOME BACK GUYS!....Hi from Guayaquil, Ecuador 🇪🇨
Sounds good! And I see Frusciante is back. That is a good thing, right? :)
❤️
What’s with the accent?
Как в старые добрые времена! Золотой состав! Джон красавчик! Рад, что он снова в строю! 😀🎸👍🏻
It's actually the far side of the moon but ok c:

They are back!
unbelievabe, welcome back John! 🇦🇷
AL FIN ! THANK U ! <3
Frusciante 🔥🔥🔥🔥
La mejor banda😍 que emoción ver de vuelta a Frusciante
Excelente siempre me encantará su música saludos desde Mexico
I'm going to see them in Vegas next summer!! Row 4 seats . Tickets cost me $800 per ticket. Had no idea they were releasing a new album. Even more hyped now.
the mojo is here more alive than ever!
Voglio piangere, davvero
Amazing to hear Frusciante back on guitar again. He's going to absolutely rip into those two guitar solos when they play live.  His solo work is such an influence on our music and it's great seeing him back in the RHCP.
Larga vida a RHCP 🌶🔥
I love this!!! Thank you!
Sounds sick I can’t wait for the concert
That strat prettier than Scarlet Johansson
Ese sonido solo puede ser los PEPPERS! 🇦🇷
The chorusy effect of John's guitar at the begginig of the song and that solo are worth John's weight in gold!
Algum BR assistindo na Madruga 🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻👏🏻😎

WOW🥰
John Frusciante is back
happy to see all of you again, with John most especially. At least we have something good in this rough and tough times. good to have y'all back.
OOOOOMG
Frusciante never disappoints
Big californication vibes here…
Welcome back, John.
Thank u john, thank u rhcp, see u later in Barcelona guys!
I feel RHCP lost their way after By The Way but this is definitely a return to form!
omg
AMÉN
Johns guitar playing is so good man
Welcome  back John.
Great song! 💯🎯😁👍
Mamma mia John...🔥
Even their clothing style stays the same after all these years. Especially Anthony's!
Dangerous!
I love this 😍
O M G
Chilli gives me a chill thoo...✌
I never thought I’d see this day… and I couldn’t be happier. Just glad I live in the same time and universe as these 4 gents!
California
Here after two hours of release, still late -_-
John and flea back together, the universe is in harmony once again 🙏🏿
Anthony looks like Eddie Guerrero here.
Yo this is great!
С любовь из России!🤍💙❤️
Good, but not as good as Ape Dirt
Reminds me soo much of the Californication era. John's guitar and Flea's bass
0:44 - 0:55 this is exactly why John is my favorite guitar player.
This is so good.
I was here in first 2h
another completely different, same song from rhcp.
I was expecting a little bit more to their first song, but still excited that John is back! I hope the other tracks are better. Still far from what they did in the past! I understand people are excited and that’s why so many exaggerated comments.
please come to Armenia and Artsakh
Bro, you can instantly recognize John's guitar tone and style. One the best guitar players, no doubt.
Fuck yeah love this
This is a special band. Forever grateful to have lived during their time.
It's perfect.
Damn I’m so happy rn Love u Peppers  Never stop ❤️
Speaking on behalf of every little chili pepper out there whose lives were changing and changed by the music of RHCP, I must say, thank you. To whom specifically, I do not know. Just thank you, for I am eternally grateful that my favorite group of slinky, funky, and rocky boys have released new music. I cried tears of joy during this video this Friday morning (here in Sweden), unexpected to say the least.  Thank you. Unlimited love from us to you, RHCP.
Frusciante is back, bitches
we've been waiting too, ya know
REALLY strong band performances on this one. Keidis' vocals are a bit meh in some places.. I think he should rerecord like 10% of his vocal so this song could be epic AF. Frusc's guitar is sick. Some nice fuzz on the solo and phaser or whatever on the early part, right? Glad they're back
Джон выглядит всё же органичнее среди стариков. Жаль что песня ни о чем.
Never thought I’d see this again… 🥲
¡Larga vida Frusciante, larga vida a los Red Hot 🌶 Peppers, impresionante sonido y energía que transmiten, bien hecho!
LETS GOOO
Bad parody of Black hole sun?
It’s been years since I’ve felt such euphoria from a song, but this single has given this joy and euphoria I haven’t had in 10+ years. It’s rough times right now , but I’m just so grateful to this band, your music means the world to mean, so thank you RHCP, for bringing light in these times of darkness.
Are these guys still from California? There aren’t 17 different references to Los Angeles in the lyrics in this one, I’m confused.
Waking up today finding out this track was released made me happy like a teenager at age 49. With all due respect for Josh Klinghoffer but the chemistry these guys have when John is around is just magical. Thanks for making my day!
Awesome ❤️
It's great to be scrolling through the comment section and seeing so much joy and excitement from the rhcp community.. I literally haven't seen a single critical comment.... great time to be a chili peppers fan!! I got my tickets to the San Diego show coming up in July.
ESTÁ MAMADOOOO!!!!!
Frusciante is back :)
Simplemente, perfecto! ❤️ 🇺🇾
sto davvero volando
I am so fucking hype
Dis ah musek fels durke like uh da durk seid uf de mune
Longa vida aos chili peppers 🌶🔥
Wuuuhuuuuu!
So grateful for this music. Please don’t ever stop creating.
I love it I love it I love it
John fruciante is back 🙌 😍
Despues de mucho tiempo, estan de regreso señores los RHCP.  Gracias por darnos buena musica. 🙂🤟
Les red hot sont ce qu'était les rolling stones, des monstres sacrés
I was not expecting this. This is fantastic.
Great song. Cant wait for the album to come out.
Can't believe they invited Keanu
I think one of the interesting things about this video is that its not too dissimilar in concept to the video "Higher Ground" with them playing in front of a green screen. Not sure if that was intentional or not, but wouldn't surprise me if it was.
I couldn't be more happy and excited to see them back. Thanks. My days are better thanks to rhcp's music, and to see them back together it's just amazing. LET'S GO!! ❤️💪
The 100 percent sounds like stadium arcadium era Rick was right
I love this band so much! So glad they are back and John too. I missed John very much. Please never leave RHCP again, man. My heart was broken and would be again. ❤️
2022 just got 100 times better LETS GO!!!
<3 <3 <3 loving the new track.. so cool! The energy these guys have is absolutely high!! :D
This is SO GOOD 🔥🌶️
Aw man, how good it feels to get new music from my favourite rock band of all time 🔥😍
Love form indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩
Always have the best music videos. Still my favourite band
¡¡¡No se mueran nunca, GENIOS!!!  * Vuelve John a RHCP: Pandemia. Los RHCP sacan su primer álbum luego de la vuelta de John: Sanación.
Glad to hear John's soft but thick tone again. Missed you guys!
Finally worth the wait
All the required Chilies content is in this track and vid.  2022 can relax.
Perfect it’s like he never left!!!
john te amo!
Good to see Deangelo Vickers in shape!
Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhh
God is finally back
Pre ordered the album last October bro I’m so hyped
Anthony sounds very Irish
China´s on the durk side of the moon
Their music influenced my life so much since when I was a depressed young teenager untill now, that I even have a tattoo about this. Love them!
Toronto Concert represent!
Frusciante is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cool.
I'm the happiest man in the world right now
Waking up  and seeing that the Chili Peppers have realised a new song. Great way to start the day 🤘
โหดสัส หกสิบแล้วก็ยังโหดสัส
Нарешті!
We´ve definitly ALL BEEN WAITING
Keep cheering us up! 🇭🇷❤️
This could easily be the soundtrack to a funky  western movie
I thnk their last 3 albums are their best personally. this felt super similar to stadium arcdium vibes. hope their next album is as good as the last two
Que gran banda ..Gracias Hermano que estas en el cielo por enseñarme lo que es la buena música..siempre te recordaré a ya casi dos años de tu partida mi Brother, y más que nunca con esta gran canción...estar presente en un estreno de este single maravilloso ya que antes era muy chico para saber y estar en sus grandes éxitos y estrenos...Red Hot Chilli Peppers Forever ..desde Argentina un honor estar vivo en estas épocas de una legendaria banda 🤘🤟🇦🇷🇦🇷
John Frusciante is the best guitarist on the planet.
RHCP FOREVER
Welcome back John! The Peppers got their heat back. Great song, we are waiting for this sad stuff to end.
My God! That guitar solo 🎸
I AM SO F*CKING EXCITED!!
Welcome back, John. I’ve missed you.
incrível como são bons. O nível sempre lá em cima... Vida longa ao RHCP ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ayyy new music c I love the guitar in it
Bienvenido a casa de nuevo John ❤️🔥 los RHCP renovados e inagotables!!! We love ya

Awesome... You, guys, are one of the best Bands that are happening to this planet still... Thank You!! 👏🏼👏🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
John's guitar solos and vocal harmonies - god I missed hearing those! Glad he's back!
Anthony mullet
Fire as always 🔥 this made my whole day. I love your sound guys, soooooooooooo good ❤️
Saludos desde Perú por fin volvieron Rhcp john frusciante 🥵😵‍💫🥵🎶🎵
O mundo é um lugar melhor quando Frusciante esta tocando !
💕RHCP 🤘🏼
olds were overfed with pills again. but sounds cool though!
return of the king
日本語で失礼します。ジョンがいるレッチリで新曲が聴ける日がまた来るなんて！しかもまさにレッチリって曲の新曲。マジで涙が止まりません。しかも続いていたと言わんばかりのダニーカルフォルニアの時の衣装でのpvなんて。。
Good to see  you again my friend :')
My favorite bartender hung out with the chili peppers back in the 90s - he said Flea was hella cool, drove a spray painted BMW and offered him a beer in the green room and Kiedis got all pissed off and said “why you giving away all our beers to this guy?!”   If you’re reading this Brian I’m comin for that ass in April
Perfect 🖤
Imagine this song was made by a no name  amateur band ...   Actually it is quite boring ..🤷🏻  Kind of a lazy rock song .. yes love that they are together !!Hope for more ambition on the next songs ❤️🤞🏼imho
Two years later and we have LIFT OFF
Looking forward to the new album.
I must be the only one who is just “meh” over this. Hope this isn’t the best they have. And what’s with the bizarre Irish accent? This is really odd stuff.
Nice. Been a long time.
Rock on!
Puta que me pariu heinnnn! <3
Yeah!!
😍
I fkin love them. In astoria Oregon walking around in magic, love forever!
Volvieron los peppers vieja ♥️
Thank you! ¡Gracias! Merci!
Awesome! comeback!, all my love RHCPs
Wow RHCP... Just wow...
Any time John comes back to the Chili Peppers it's like he never left. And it also seems like every time he comes back their music matures, BUT you can INSTANTLY tell it is the Chili Peppers!!!!! So glad John came back. Don't get me wrong Josh was great, but it was a different RHCP. With John you know just about any song they make is going to be a hit.
Шикарно, впрочем как и всегда.
al fin loco, tanto esperar! ya vengan a argentina de una vez.
God, no?
it hits differrent
Thank you for making such beautiful music! We love you all, long live the red hot chili peppers!
Caramba
TA DOIDO PAISIN
Oh my god yes!!!!
Hadir 😂
As lendas voltaram com tudo, que sdds que estava Red ❤
Fantastic
Can you understand the joy of listening to new Red Hot songs when I return from school !!!
That was epic, that was amazing and exhilarating and emotional! I am so happy John is back in the band again! I will be playing this on repeat! Can't wait for the album!
I seem to feel the mold of the old albums !! I love this song, what a fantastic solo !!! John don't go anymore !!!! you are the soul of red hot !!
YOOOOOOOO
Now this sounds right. They just sound perfect when John is in the band. I can't wait to hear more.
I find it boring, honestly. This is just fan-service.
No está muerto Diego Verdaguer
Akhirnya...  John F 😎
Stadium Arcadium Vibes! Love It! God Bless RHCP!
First John RHCP solo in years and it’s beautiful
O brabo ta de voltaaaaaaaaaaaa
I am very glad that they are together again ! an amazing song ! I 've already listened to it ten times on repeat
Danny Trejo looks strange
Diego Verdaguer no murió, se fue a cantar con los RED. (BROMA) RIAN POR FAVOR
your quality never gets old as you get older
Okay but when they all come together into frame on beat I lost it.
Ред Хот мать его чилли пепперс! Я соскучился!
God his vocals are extra awful on this song
When i woke this morning and seen that they had released this song, and the date of the 17 track new album I nearly died. But then realised that if I died I wouldn't hear the rest of the album and get tae see them in Glasgow, and have this on my vinyl player every day until I die. So what am saying is, I'm extremely haply with this song and can't wait for the new album, so good to have John back 🙌
Majestuoso Increíble Celestial Encantador Fascinante Delicioso Espectacular
Can’t wait to see you live in Budapest in the summer.
amazing！returned Red Hot Chili Peppers!
😍😍😍😍😍
What a time to be alive 🤘🏻
Terbaiklahhhhhh..salam dari ginjal
Missed you John!!!!❤❤🤟
GOD IS BACK
We missed you John
Incredible!
Great tune!
Finallllyyyy yesss ALABAMA!
Hell yeah, peppers are back! 10 California out of 10 pum pa pida pipibitu
пожалуй, норм!
Welcome back John!!!!!
2:42 here says "riding on a..." And in that word something sounds weird...I can't identify what it is
They never disappoint. It's so good to have John back.
The return of the prodigal son. Cheers to John
Piękna piosenka 🔥🔥🔥 warto było czekać ❤️
I can’t wait for until release their new albums. They are my hero and changed my life.
Johnn is baaaaaack 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
Damn it’s more perfect than I’d ever dreamed it would be.

OMG.. It's amazing 😍 i can't believe my eyes ! It's really happened
Just normal peppers song. No surprise. But glad to see john back.

This new song is amazing, so excited to see the whole of the new album they created with their returning guitarist john wick
Фрушанте вернулся!!! Это сразу слышно!  Я счастлив!🇺🇦
A short jump 20 years back in the past. This is so fresh and also so new. Thanks RHCP, and John is back! Crazy solo 🤙
Mandalorian set?
Too much love 💕❤
Great new track, can't wait for June 22 when I finally get to see them live.
JFroosh!
No one going to mention that Keidis is singing like a West Country folk singer yearning for cider apples and a nice plum rub?
I love it
On very 2nd listening, if this is a radio version, I wanna full song! God bless from Croatia!
Here before the first 100k. So pumped to see these guys!
My life is complete again
2:50 best scene ever
Im so pleased John is back 🤟🏻
Que ganas de ver a los Red Hot en vivo con John!! 🇨🇱🇨🇱🔥🌶
The essence intact. Thank you for continuing to give us art, for many more songs....  From a land with RHCP in the ❤️, we wait for you whenever you want.  Nice song, beautiful video brothers    🖤🇦🇷💚 🤘🏼👽

Oh wow, not long enough wish it was longer , ohmygosh!!!
Repeat, repeat, repeat...
❤️❤️❤️
It starts of kinda slow an I was like "hmm...I'm not sure what that is gonna be" but when John kicks in, it really feels home and it's already growing on me on the second listen. Can't wait for the album!
It's not an RHCP music video if Anthony isn't shirtless by the end
Red Hot Chili Peppers created a masterpice once again! Cant't wait for the rest! JOHN IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!
I FUCKIN LOVE YOU GUYS
LOS AMOO MIS VIEJITOS PRECIOSOS ❤️😍 SON LA MERA V 🇲🇽
Brilla de nuevo esa guitarra de Jhon gracias por el regreso a romperla papá ❤️
HNNNNG YUSSSSSyes yes yes yes YUSSHHHHH! YESSSSS!!!!
glad to see them all together again. Great stuff. See ya in Summer!
Dirk side
ジョンっっっっ！！！
So nice to have John back, his backup vocals were sorely missed. It's funny how as soon as he comes back the music is instant classics again.
They're still red hot
RHCP are always a fantastic band. John, is the best guitarist !!!
Can't wait to see them singing this masterpiece live 😏
Как всегда очень КРУТО!!!!!!!Спасибо!!!)
Cada música que a red hot chili peppers faz é uma obra prima prometo sempre voltar aqui de ano em ano para relembrar as músicas de vocês aliás obrigado por mais uma música sensacional
Thanks 🥰
I’m really happy to see them together.
John's solo is still good!!!! Go RHCP!!!
John regreso 🌶❤🤟🏽
Me recuerda mucho a slow cheetah, estaba tan ansioso por escucharla
🍻
THE RETURN OF THE KING
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR 6 LONG YEARS. AND WAS WORTH IT. THIS NEW ALBUM WITH THE RETURN OF JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS ABOUT TO BE A MASTER PIECE. RED HOTS FO'LIFE!!!
In thiam hle mai !!!!
I love this! Especially because John is back. I also love how they adapt to music today without loosing their core essence. I can’t wait for their album to drop! 🎉🎊
John Frusciante!
Viendo a frusciante luego de más de 12 ańos separado de la banda
So happy to have some new music from them, perfect antidote to this crazy world we find ourselves in
What did I miss? Why is John Wick playing lead guitar for the Peppers?
Going to See Them in Germany in July... Frusciante is the reason a new Generation picked up the guitar, myself included. One of my lifetime dreams come true!
awesome...the real red hot...
Cuando escucho el solo de guitarra de Frusciante me imagino mariposas sobrevolar por las brisas de una galaxia intermitente, el renacer de melodías que irradian almas incandescentemente y el soñar de mis abrazos en amaneceres eternos. ❤❤❤
I still can’t get over how multitalented Will Ferrell is. Wow!
increibleee
Антошка подтянул форму, красава 😊👍
RHCP still going harder than ever after all these years! 🎯🎸🤘
Seeing Frusciante back with the band just made my year
After 40 years still the best band out there, feeling hyped for the new album, rock n roll!!!
This single is cool it’s classic slow chilis rock and unmistakeable John guitar sound. Just hoping all the other songs are funk!
Meh
Ну ёкарный бабай)
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PEPPERS
73k views. Soon this will have millions!
So schön...
solos was killer fo sure john !
Brilliant!
HE IS BACK
👏👏👏👏👏👏💯
Vida longa aos Peppers !!!! ❤👐👏🔥
Giving off some real Stadium Arcadium vibes!
Bass kasingpa hi makhaman va maning makho .....🤘🤘🤘🤘
I reckon it took the chili peppers 2-3 hours top to churn out this completely forgettable middle of the road single. Hopefully this means that this is the most accessible and sellable song of the new album and that we can look forward to the return of the experimental frusciante who hopefully wants to make art and not money.
John Fruciante <3
Es la primera vez que veo y escucho un estreno de lo Rhcp ya que nunca pude hacerlo por que antes era mas chico y no entendia de buena musica...Me alegra estar vivo para presenciar esto con el regreso de John
Como extrañaba esa guitarra y esos coros. Gracias por volver, John ❤ el adolescente que vive en mí y yo irradiamos felicidad y entusiasmo 💯
Meu amor todinho! ♥️♥️
We love you guys 🤟❤🎸🎸🎸
Superb 🔥
The boys are back!!! 🤘🏻Love the new song guys, can’t wait to see you in June ♥️
Very very very Average.
Where did this come from? Awesome work....I'm gonna eat some chili peppers now muhaha
Klr mano valeu a espera mano
Love you forever! ❤️
This is lit!
The song is stinker. Disappointing but was inevitable.  They’re so old now. They can’t be amazing forever. The search continues for the next big band…
Como eu esperei por isso, os caras não decepcionam!
Feels so good… THANK YOU
Just want to say thank you rhcp! Thanks a lot! :')
❤️
Long live RHCP  Long live John frusciante
Why is Anthony phrasing so weirdly? Love the music, but hard to take this seriously
Úr isten, annyira jó!!
i feel alive ❤️
Love how everyone’s so used to Anthony being topless that when everyone but him is dressed in the video it’s not even weird or questioned
So good to see John Frusciante again! 💥I'm waiting for more!!
<3
Que foda ❤❤❤🇧🇷
Ура! Европа, впусти нас, россиян, на концерты! Мне нужно в этой жизни услышать Джона живьём.
They are Back!!! With John F. after 16 years
Pinch me I think I’m dreaming!Never thought I’d see that fender strat again.
This is amazing. Good time to be alive.
Forever lovin John.
So I’m wakin my ass up and the first thing I hear is a good vibe … thank u ❤️
I'm 19 years old but I really like classic Rock stuffs and RHCP is one of them.  Glad that they release new songs perfect for me to grow with them 🙂.
Why’s Anthony signing like a country and western guy
良すぎてやばい🔥最高🙌大好き！❤️
Get this directly into my body. Somehow. Now.
It feels like I'm listening to a song from stadium arcadium for some reason, must be John's insane sound. Their essence is intact, they're back man I'm so happy
You can feel the shift from Josh to John in this song. We have the old rhcp funk style in this song.
Unlimited Love Tracklist:  1. “Black Summer” 2. “Here Ever After” 3. “Aquatic Mouth Dance” 4. “Not the One” 5. “Poster Child” 6. “The Great Apes” 7. “It’s Only Natural” 8. “She’s a Lover” 9. “These Are the Ways” 10. “Whatchu Thinkin'” 11. “Bastards of Light” 12. “White Braids & Pillow Chair” 13. “One Way Traffic” 14. “Veronica” 15. “Let ‘Em Cry” 16. “The Heavy Wing” 17. “Tangelo”  Yup, sounds like RHCP to me!
Sounds like a b-side song from By The Way. Hopefully the album will be better.
I'm not crying. You are
🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Hagamos como que no lo escuchamos todavía
❤️😭
John...❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can feel the Unlimited LOVE. Thanks guys!!! You are the BEST!!!
It’s a beautiful thing to see four people that love each so much, come through life’s trials and tribulations and continue to make art that means so much to people. This is a dose of such joy. I love the chilis so much.
This is terrible
Can’t describe how good I feel to hear John back with the peppers after 15 years… 🌶🔥
I can’t believe my eyes or ears right now. Am I alive or did someone kill me and send me to heaven?
Happy International Unicorn Day 🦄
no importa cuando siempre se siente esa alta buena vibra que transmiten los red hot
It's decent
La mejor banda! Sin duda! Vale la pena siempre esperar el tiempo que sea para cada canción... Y lo que viene... 🇲🇽
Eeeee, they’re back
Been too long without hearing those killer John Frusciante backup vocals!
最っっっ高にイカしてる
🇧🇷
Stoked from heaven 🤘
It feels classic but also very refreshing, best musicians I have ever seen!!!
Un placer volver a veros amigos 😊
Love to see John back, though now I miss Josh too.. Such mixed feelings, however the result is a gem of a song!🎸
This is so crap
Thank you for the music. This year is going to amazing.
no podia esperar mas 😭
Silverio canta para los peppers ahora?! Wow!
We’ve been waiting. A long time it has been indeed.
Киддис, надеюсь не принимает наркоту. К остальным участникам группы таких вопросов нет) Звучит очень круто.
Rhcp with frusciante back just hits different
No corre do som feito  no cllr💾🔥🧐https://youtu.be/28NboiWSj-c
Frusciante looking like he's barely aged
Please come to poland🇵🇱
Long Live RHCP , This was just another beauty :)
😍...🙏               ...💞🌍🌎🌏💞...
Welcome back friends !
❤️❤️❤️
LYRICS [Verse 1] A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hear me now)  [Verse 2] Platypus are a few The secret life of Roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My crater weighs a ton The archer's on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  [Chorus] It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long timе and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Verse 3] Back the flaming whip Are sailin' on our censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  [Chorus] Been a long time since I made a new friend Waitin' on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waitin' on another black summer to end  [Outro] I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end I've been waitin', I've been waitin' Waitin' on another black summer to end  *RESPECT FROM GREECE*
Anthony sounds kinda like he’s from Wisconsin ‘eh?
I DO WAIT THIS SONG!!!
I miss you john.
Thank you
Rico
Я так долго ждал!! 6 лет, ребята, 6 долгих лет... Спасибо, ребята, вы даёте мне импульс к жизни.   Вряд ли вы это прочитаете и сможете перевести на английский, но думаю я не один, кого музыка РХЧП сопровождает в тяжелые периоды в жизни и помогает взглянуть по-другому на ситуацию, помогает сделать нужный выбор, несмотря на абсурдность и казалось бы безнадежность ситуации, благодаря чему получается ещё раз преодолеть трудности жизни. Огромное СПАСИБО вам за ваше творчество, Перцы!
I love RHCP very
I was 10 when I saw them in the thrasher movie in 1986 and instantly fell in love with their style thank you for so many happy memories
When a dream come true… Frusciante back at rhcp and it sounds perfect!
Stupenda Stupenda Stupenda ♥️♥️♥️ Ti entra subito in testa ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 W i Red Hot 💋💋♥️♥️♥️
🔥R🔥H🔥C🔥P🔥
Thank God. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.  Welcome back John!
BEST IN THE FUCKIN WORLD
It reminds the doors a bit and another it  looks apocalypse

The return of the fearsome four.
They're back!!!!!!! Love love love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ How do they still look and sounds so awesome I don't know but so grateful for it!!!
My love for them will never die, I can’t even put into words the effect their music has on my existence honestly. Such a special curation of individuals coming together and jamming tf out
Frushhh is back!
Kiedis rocking his inner Joe Exotic here 😎
🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Lest goo red hot  the best music
This was nice, thank you, and that solo was everything!
Missed them so much, love the song at first hear, bless them :) ps: i need the life elixir AK is taking
I’m kinda surprised here, feels like By the way + Stadium Arcadium album vibes for me. Love it, can’t wait for more of what’s to come!! I wasn’t getting my hopes up but now they sure are after this lol
I could cry - this is beautiful! I love the visuals - it almost shows the band going their separate ways, before coming back together in this mighty moment to gift the world with incredible new music. Long live RHCP! 🖤
please give us the rest
THE KING IS BACK!
This is so good after a long time there is new music, Love it
Con el regreso de frusciante volvió los rhcp . Es el complemento la voz sonora el alma del grupo .. gracias jon
God please let other songs be less Joe Exotic-ish.
anthony looks like lionel ritchie in this
Behold, Guitar Jesus has ressurected again!
orgullosa de tenerlos en mi brazo los amo demaciado que pedazo de banda!! super virtuosos todos juntos y por individual 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
great solo.. john is back 🤝🏼❤
THEY ARE BACK ♡

eu estou chorando de alegria...o Jhon de volta é como o filho pródigo voltando a casa, temos que celebrar, ele não estava perdido nem fez nada errado, mas sentimos tanta falta dele.... só alegria com isso, música maravilhosa
GGWP ADICK ADICK 🌞⬛🔥🔥
John frusciante is Back!!!!!!
Even though I found this song to be  not amazing but certainly not bad at first listen, (love the guitars in this track) it doesn't change my support and love for their music and journey and I look forward to the album and tour!
Wow los red hot chili Peppers están de regreso con Yon frucianti
Red hot is back!!!! Thnks God
Эпичное Выступление Ждем С Концертами В Москве!
So fucking good to have John back again. Last 2 albums sorely missed a proper guitarist
❤🧡💛  старая банда, вновь в полном составе! Кайф!
Hola chicos, gracias por esta nueva canción, los amo💕
que felicidaaaad!!!
Yayyyu~~~
Not dissatisfied. Keep the music alive!
Wish there was cc
what's not to like? <3
If we look at them... it's hard to comprehend that this band has one of the top of the game guys in guitar, bass, drums. Fate brought them together
Thanks RHCP,  just thank u🌶❤️
Keren👍👍👍🇮🇩
Please put this in borderlands
🌶💪
AMAZING! I LOVED IT!
I'm a simple man. I see RHCP - I click
FUCK YESS, CHILI REUNION 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
АААААА АХУЕТЬ
This takes me all the way back to Stadium Arcadium. What a great feeling. I loved Josh and the things he brought to the band but man oh man is this something else!!!
HE’S BACK!!! 😭😭
Need an instrumental version asap
grande el Diego verdaguer publicando su última canción antes de su muerte
Amazing to see them performing together again. Amazing as well how John´s signature sound can be heard from the beginning.
Masterpiece.
Johhhhhnnnnn!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Why am i crying?
Minha nossa a música ficou muito boa parabéns.
AMO ESSA BANDA COM O MEU CORAÇÃO
!!!!!!2022 IS GOING TO BE GOOD!!!!! FINALLY YES BABY
I'm quite impressed. This is a joke right? Comments here seem to float on nostalgy and sympathy, they can't be judging on the music alone. I listened to this seven times now, and this is the weakest shit I've ever come across from this band, and I've been listening to everything. Voice, melody, production, even the guitar solo seem to go nowhere. Wow.
Es conmovedor verlos juntos de nuevo <3
Fuck yeah for Frusciante
RHCP FOREVER ❤️‍🔥
Hell yea John 🤘🤘🤘
This is everything I hoped it would be!! 🇭🇷🇭🇷❤️🖤
Perfect chill song that slowly turns into an elegant fire ☀️
พี่จอร์น กลับมาแว้ววววววววววว
So boring
It seems  that John Frusciante cannot be replaced.  I'm very happy with the song, thanks guys you made my day.
I'M HERE AT 44K VIEWS!
OMG!!😱 Diego verdaguer está vivo!!
I feel bad for Josh klinghoffer. I miss you Josh. I thought I will never listen to red hot chili peppers new musics but it's impossible to stop listening red hot chili peppers. 🙏
They back!!!
🤗🤗🤗 John 🤗🤗🤗
Sounds like it could be a song on a follow-up album to Californication. Has that same vibe.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Cuántas emociones lindas surgieron de mí mientras veía éste nuevo video de la nueva canción. Necesitaba nuevos aires pepperos después de largos seis años de la salida de The getaway. Por muchos años más de Red Hot Chili Peppers!
Honestly, for me the sound of Frusciante is stale, a sound of the past, I miss the sound of Josh's guitar.
Thank you boys!!! Feeling one more time!!
wait what...  a new RHCP track and i didn't know about it?......    TURN IT UPPPP!!!!!!!!!!
Thank You ❤️
44k views and 48k likes! Only RHCP can do it.
I like the new song.
Ahh bee
Fruscaiante is back🤘
Fenomeni👍👍👍
Love❤️
best hot peppers))))))
que emocionante verlo de nuevo a john :c
John 🥲
The "cruelty" with which the band and the fans chose one man, John, inhabits this song, and it is outstandingly beautiful. Everyone wanted to have this beauty so badly, so cruelly...
レッチリはやっぱりこの4人だなぁ ジョンのギターが聴けただけで感動だよ
Wna kabros
I LOVED IT!!!! 😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Legend is always a legend
Ничего себе, впервые попал в первые часы на клип Перцев)
Average… would only be considered a B-side from Stadium Arcadium. I’m so hoping there is a song on the album that blows me away immediately and not like this song where you have to listen to hundreds of times just to be like hmmm yeah it’s alright.
Man Red Hot Chili Peppers will forever be my favorite band of all time.
this is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen ever
Vão adiantar o álbum e em breve turnê , que venha o anúncio da segunda parte da turnê, que venha o Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The chorus sounds a bit like Slow Cheetah's
Frusciante is back baby!!
I heard he borrowed those moves from Mike Patton.
Vai Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🖤🖤🖤🌶️🌶️🌶️🔥🔥🔥
Okay but what's up with Flea and the paint can dance? Effing hilarious lololol love that man!
perfect...!!!
Californication vibes. Best vibes.
I’m almost crying! Such a nice surprise 😭🥰
John :')
i did not enjoy this song at all but i gotta say i have tremendous respect for these guys still doing what they love
AAAAAAAAAA 🥺❤️
Fuck... yes... this has made me the happiest I have been in a long time
Finally they're back...john is back...im crying..nostalgic 💫💫
Korn releases requiem and rhcp release this absolute banger. What a day for music today.
They look and sound healed and happy!
Guys i have 3 tickets to Budapest concert for sale, anyone intersested? Im serious
no cause this is so good
Amazing Amazing Amazing!!!! Super song !!!!! Super band !!! FRUSCIANTE IS GOD !!!!!!!!!! 🎸🎸🎸
💜💜💜
Завязывайте с наркотой...
i love
WE FINALLY GOT IT AAAAH
JOHN FUCKING FRUSCIANTE
The red hot chili peppers are back!
I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY YOU HAVE NO IDEA AHH
Wow, wow, wow! So amazing! John brings the peppers totally back to life! He’s just there in his red and black cotton shirt being one element with his guitar, drops a heavy solo after not even 2 minutes. He let have Anthony and Flea the little craziness and bring back the rock. This is what they needed. This sound has strong vibes from their best times. The new record is going to be so good!!! Unlimited love!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Anthony is almost 60 here 😳😳😳😳
Considering todays pop songs and trends they didn't care about it and kept their original sound.❤
I LOVE RHCP!!!!!! I’VE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS GODDAMN!!!!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
ПРИВЕТ ИЗ РОССИИ! HELLO FROM RUSSIA! 🐧⚡
Nostalgic💫💫
I feel the same vibes like when Stadium Arcadium came out
I love it guys! Thank you! I needed this!
This is awesome for modern Chili Peppers 😄 looking forward to the album! Sounds like a mix of By the Way and Stadium Arcadium
It’s just the beginning boys 😎
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Boy oh boy 😍
Damas y caballeros los red hot regresaron!!! :')
John ahhhhhh the boy is back
47
Started to smile as soon as I understood that they were REALLY back. Thank you guys, you don’t know how much important you are for our lives.
I am mostly a metalcore fan. But something about Red Hot Chili Peppers get me everyone. It helps having John back. He’s one of the reasons i picked up a guitar. Such a great song
@0:45 The third coming of Jesus
Que felicidad!!! Cuanto mas escuchas la canción... Mas te gusta
Let's be honest,  as good as it is to see them together again  the song is bang average Little development from stadium arcadium. I'm not sure this song would make it on that album
Quanta differenza con le ultime canzoni. Nulla contro Josh perché resterà comunque nei nostri cuori ma John è un altro pianeta. E' tornato lui e i Red ti tirano fuori una canzone cosi "calda", "calorosa", ricca di virtuosismi...sembra essere tornati al 2006!  Grazie ragazzi di esistere e resistere!!  LUNGA VITA AI PEPERONCINI!
I love RHCP but the chorus just sounds like a half-baked version of the chorus in their song, "Midnight".
Finally John Frusciante back. I'm so excited 😊😊😊
Love it🇬🇧
No mames 😎
Buenardo
LOS AMOOOOOOOO!!! 🇨🇱
Vocês são fantásticos! ⚡⚡⚡🔥🔥🔥
More likes than views
Hold up these mfs are still alive?
Wow
Fru’s Strat is pure nostalgia
I missed john’s guitar sooo much
These guys are so old and beautiful!😜I love it! Frusciantes solo makes the entire song! Wonderful!
Ура, как же я рад снова их слышать вчетвером
why is john wick playing guitar with rhcp
Os cara tem uma juventude q nem uma outra banda tem ou vai ter!!!!  Anthony não envelhece, melhor vocalista do mundo!!!!!?
Mierda!!!!! El sonido de la guitarra de John y el bajo de flea es lo más hermoso que he escuchado en muchísimo tiempo. Los extrañaba la vida entera!!!!!!
GOD SAVE THE CHILIS!!!!
This gives me chills.  Like everyone else I've been eagerly anticipating new Chili Peppers since hearing of the return of the Mighty John Fruiscante. But this caught me off guard.  Can we talk about the lyrical content for a minute? I get soundtrack to the apocalypse vibes from this.  They are giving voice,  as they always do to the zeitgeist of the day.  This one hits different,  and I'm here for it.
The old gang is back
the authentic peppers sound!!!!
Это самое прекрасное, что я видел в своей жизни
Rock and roll again Will Ferrell
I didn't know they take out another album since 2016!.... Cool!
When you look up “getting the band back together” this video will pop up
Wow what a great day this is class. The final shots of the 4 together is amazing to watch
welcome back John! I love u
0:46 is when I really *really* felt it. Love this song, I feel like we're all waiting right now.
They are fucking back!! ✳
Perfect as ever. This band could never do a bad song. ❤
Best part of the song 1:52
Korn and RHCP. The same day. Wtf? 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Let’s gooooooo, so excited for this new album and to finally see these guys live
So happy 🙂🙂 to see you.... reviving all the rhcp moments
I've been waiting for this all my life
Who else missed John to return so much??
This makes my soul happy. Welcome back John
37k views in 2 hours... how good is that!
Felt like I’ve already listened to this song before on first time hearing it. They really need some new ideas :(  very underwhelmed
ON REPEAT! FOOK YAH
Glad to see John back with the crew again.
Que video más feo, hasta Behind The Sun con bajo presupuesto tenía mas onda que esto, soy fan y es una cagada ver como no podemos ver un poco de creatividad en las producciones actuales.
Los red volvieron unraa!!
seeing john again makes me so happy :)
Damn, this is fucking epic. Love this band
I'm crying rn. Literally. I needed this song so bad. Thank you.
3:16. AK wholeheartedly said it
Un solo de guitarra sin ideas de comienzo a fin, no transmite nada. La cancion parece un refrito de varios estribillos de canciones anteriores. Espero el proximo single.
Esto me alegro la noche conchasumadreeee!!!!
Peppers broke the views counter 😂😂😂
Thank you God for Frusciante coming back. Literally the GOAT, all of them.
Guyssss we were expecting for so long. Just THANKS!!!
my first band. my first love. my first obssession. it's been 20 years since we started our journey. I shared a tear watching this, mostly for being nostalgic. see you this summer guys!
Californication if it was a sea shanty rock song
La última buena canción de los red hot fue snow hey oh.
The first time I heard RHCP was back in ‘92 when I was 10, now I’m 40 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤚🏻🤚🏻
Por fin!!!!!!! Lo espere por mucho!!!! Nuevo tema de mis favoritos, los grandes RHCP, la formación que más me gusta!!!! A propósito, gran tema #RHCPForever
This sounds like someone programmed an AI to write a RHCP song, and like other AI songs it sux.
FINALMENTE ❤❤❤
ผมรักวงนี้...ดีใจมากเห็นการกลับมาของ John     🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Que gusto darte cuenta que la buena música sigue viva 🤟🤟🤟 saludos desde Honduras 🇭🇳🇭🇳, larga vida a Red Hot Chilipeppers 🤟🤟
🔥🔥🔥
Will Ferrel looks fantastic
I'm not crying, you are.
yeaaaahhh 👍😭😭
Grabe antagal Kong hinintay ito Salamat sa inyong apat
THis is literally redemption RHCP
John and his solo ♥️♥️♥️♥️ Yes yes yes!
We've been waiting, we've been waiting, waiting to see you four to play again! RHCP!!!
California kings🌶🌶🔥🔥
I’ve been waiting 14 years to see John back. What a relief.
I think Jimi Hendrix was a big influence here, just think of his voice instead of Kiedis and it will fit just as good
Maaaaan, this song, the faces, and John's solo... Can't wait to listen to the full album 😍😍
How am I supposed to take this seriously when all I see is a giant silly moustache
Simply ❤
John back again amazing!!
Universe: Thanks for the bliss of see then togheter again and creating new songs!
Lo que hacen ellos es magia! Es increíble lo que siguen generando a pesar de los años. Gracias por tanto RHCP!!!🌶🔥 🇦🇷
aaah yes, the good old RHCP i loved
They’re  back! And HERE’S JOHNNY!
AGUANTEN LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS SALUDOS DESDE CORDOBA ARGENTINA!!!
You guys still rock , made me happy that you guys still have it!!

Simplemente los amo❤😍.
Guitar tone at end of solo is on point

Wow, Goosebumps! Frusciante ❤️
Much love man. You guys are my favorite band
Feels like everything is in the right place again.
Geil. Kaum ist John Frusciante wieder dabei, hat man wieder genau den Sound, den RHCP brauchen. Er war schon immer der spezielle Funke, den es brauchte.
Me hacen tan feliz! Regresen pronto a México 🇲🇽 ❤️
Awesome 😎👍

RHCP are magnificent! Great comeback single!
We’ve been waiting for you! Наконец то, родные!❤️ from Russia with love
Espetacular.  ELES VOLTARAM.
Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy..................RHCP back with a magical song!❤ 🌶

Good but same old sound
Еееееппппп. Атмосфера 2003го...)))
Os quiero tanto
"I'm with You" один із моїх найулюбленіших альбомів у принципі, та все ж, який я радий знову бачити пана Фрущанте у складі гурту!) З поверненням легендо! Чекаємо у Києві!
I'm acc sooo excited for their album     I pray they come to the UK
it's so nice hearing new music from John :')
These guys don't age at all.
John Anthony Motherfucking Frusciante. That is all.
Vcs são os maiores

Dang Anthony has like the most well maintained physique over time.
Reminds me of a Sailor Shanty. Friggen dope as hell though! Keep up the jams RHCP!! 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Fantastic! - Dream come true seeing them together again!  Long live the Kings RHCP!!!
Love how we first see John back for the first time in forever, but not without the guitar we all know and love : )  You can tell it's gotten older like the rest of us : )  Crazy we all made it this far : )
Los amo❤️❤️
Ever since I heard the band for the first time (when I was a Child) I loved all their songs so much, I'm a big fan and I'm excited to see them in June in Barcelona! LOVE RHCP 💜  John, I'm so glad you come back! ㅜㅜ
Holy shit
Great!
Mis oídos estaban impacientes por esto
I CANT BREATHE PROPERLY
Increíble ❤️
WE FUCKING LOVE U!!!
this is the best day of my life

RHCP is back baby 🤪🤩😍🥰
Love the energy!! Still can’t believe that John is back in the band(Josh is also awesome but you know)!!
Can't believe Anthony's been fighting ninjas for more than 30 years now
historic moment😭❤️
Goed!
I like it, feels like a b-side to me
Да! Это именно то чего я ждал! : (Yeah! That`s exactly what I expected for!)
Damn... I felt awesome seeing all of them together., ❤️🔥
Nice!
chills
When I've heard back in 2019 that he is coming back I couldn't believe it and to this day it feel almost unreal that John is playing and recording new music with them again. I'm so happy to see and hear all four of them playing together. Great song!!
Sounds like Stadium Arcadium's B-side. Seeing John's back feels surreal.
They are finally back : )
I thought Keanu Reeves only played bass :)
Класс!
God he’s got such a terrible voice
Finally!!!! Thanks  rhcp!!
Spread the word. Frusciante is back
Waiting for  you 🇮🇱 big love
Caralhoooo que clipeee
Buena rolaaa!🖤 Fue una tormenta de emociones ver este video, por siempre red hot chilli peppers🤘🏼 tqm John, saludos desde México 🇲🇽
Fru looks like John... Wick😆  This one is good as they always do...
Omg, wait album XD
This song and MV really feels like them coming back together. Especially that ending.

RHCP FOREVER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE YOOOUUU ❤️❤️❤️
So nice to see John back.
Full chills. Good to have you back boys 🤘🌶
Without John it was great, but with John it’s magic. Beyond psyched for the upcoming tour!!!
god these latinos anger me ur listening to an English song type in ENGLISH! its not even my first language still i know it.
Iconic.
Me encanta!
Anthony with the accent 😂😂 Why is he doing that? Hahaha. Still love it 🤘 John fuckin' kills it!
めちゃくちゃいい
❤❤❤❤
THIS makes me happy 😭🙌♥️🌶️
Its like he never left
🤘 Man I love this band
John's on fire like usual 😍😎
Thank you for always giving us emotions through music! Love from Italy❤
Is John Frusciante or Keanu Reeves?  Amazing !!!
visita 32,704
So Jesus has returned again
O melhor do mundo!!!!
They still have my ears, eyes, & heart. Thank you RHCP!
The likes on this video nearly double the actual views.  Beginning to think this is not a bug, guys.
This drum groove seems so close to californication. This new song is just amazing
Wooohooo! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
New RHCH! I stopped everything and clicked✨✨✨
THE BEST BAND EVER. EVER!
John Frusciante is back forreal 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Sukses terus pak de...
Apenas me despierto y veo esto. LOCURAAA los amo red hot
John Frusciante is a musical genius, in a very literal way. Every album he did with the RHCP was a major hit. He is both a very talented player and a singer too. Probably one of the pioneering guitarists who brushed into electronic music. His playing style is like he is a direct disciple of Jimi Hendrix himself, passing down the craft to a new generation.
LOS AMO GRACIAS
Funky m****fk***aaaaaaaa
Felicidad… lo único que siento en este momento :’)
I am not blown away but it is a nice song. Had preferred a more energetic first single considering the boost John's return has given them.
They‘re back and sound fucking amazing. Crazy how they could keep there crazy young spirits alive. I love this song.
Can't wait for the whole album
Woooowwww just wooooowwww!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
This is the light at the end of Covid
Red Hot better than ever🌶🌶🌶
Slow cheetah
I'm just so happy to see the four of them back together 😍 can't wait to hear the rest of this album!
A new song on my birthday? Love it! ps: I have the right arm tribal tattoo that Anthony has.
y el california donde esta :/
Sounds classic😭❤🥰❤😎
Nice new mellow track!! Can’t wait for the rest!! From Australia see you guys when you tour next once allowed.
Absolutely awesome, right I will do a YouTube cover 👌🏼
La magia que tienen estos cuatro tipos juntos es increíble 🖤
ESTO ES LEGENDARIO 🔥❤
🔥❤️‍🔥
Visuals of this video are good
Just to tame the overall "I'm already a fanboy, of course I love it!". I'll be waiting for the full album release but this song, to my ears, was too easy, too clean, there's something missing.
Magic is back
This sort of thing will cure covid.
Que temazo! RHCP para siempree
Wowwwwwwwww 👏👏👏👏🥺
Let's GO!

With all the respect for Josh …The Man is back to Town!…I’m Looking forward to listening the whole album!
Dang frusciante really sounds like hendrix on that solo
Me palmo mis locos
Everyone be quite please.....I'm trying to listen to greatness
Absolutely amazing.

Its amazing!!  Vengan al Perú!! 🇵🇪
This is just amazing! Great song can't wait to listen to the full album
La espera acabo
I been waiting for this
It’s so good they are still making music🤘🤘🤘
:)
Where's the damn REPEAT button!! Love it! They're back! Goosebumps!
RHCP being RHCP again! Thanks John for joining back.
But is it a dirty black summer? 😉🤔
So glad you're all back together! New song is fantastic
Will Ferrell killing it on the drum kit
Jesus is back!
Улыбка, когда видишь в этом составе Джона, да ещё и новая песня!
A esperar por el nuevo álbum
What was lacking in my life was now fulfilled. They are my youth itself.
Actually am surprised how good this track is. Blood Sugar Sex Magik will forever be my fav rhcp album
Awesome!
It's like going back 20 years to tie times of By The Way/Stadium Arcadium. AMAZING!
Welcome back
YES!
Love form Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
A “normal” song but that guitar is special. The band being enlightened by Johns playing and him being able to play some “pop music” is a perfect match. I was expecting something more but let’s see what’s next.
Wow, amazing! The music as well as the visuals of the clip, like the good and old ones! Like RHCP *** 🤘
Chefs kiss 🥰💋🤌🏼
Omg you did it again! You are the best!
JohnFru is a god.
I’m crying ❤️
THANK UUUUU ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMG
Jesus come back
I got much older since I saw something new from you last time, guys. Much love from Russia.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥✨
The aura of the music that I miss. Fc from Thailand
Круто!!! Спасибо!!!
I’m Looking forward to other new songs. Let’s be honest Not the best song…  I’ll love it eventually. Excited to see them in concert.
legendary
Lord Frusciante is back
im waiting
ASÍ ES SOY EL COMENTARIO EN ESPAÑOL ESCRIBE AQUÍ PARA QUE LO LEAMOS TODOS.
They'll never get old! 🎶🇮🇹
i fucking love it
Reminds me of the Black Hole Sun. RIP Chris Cornell
Ça fait tellement plaisir de les retrouver tous réunis. Et le son de John est unique. Fantastique !! Vive les Red Hot !!
You all gonna hate me... Glad they're back, but the song is like something AI sould put together analyzing their old songs. Sure, someone wanted it to be just like that, glad for them... But I have faith, wanting and waiting for more. 💪
Wonderful one🔥🔥🔥
❤🇧🇷
Thank you guys for continuing to make beautiful music. I can not wait for this masterpiece. And please bring on the B-Sides as well. We want to hear all your hard work. Love you guys. Can’t wait to see you in L.A. later this year ❤️
Is this a dream wtf hahahha
It’s…it’s like John never left. They look whole again. I was fully ready to embrace Josh from the jump, and they made some interesting music with him, but with John it’s just MAGIC. He balances the chaotic formula that is the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a balance so delicate I didn’t even realize it was off. *shakes head* And here I thought I had nothing left to learn from this band….I’ve never been happier to be proven wrong ❤️🤘🏽
drummer look like will farrell for real
rhcp..
С возвращением! Время как будто вас не тронуло.
Solid!!!!
Oh how I've missed you guys together!!! 😍
Finally this 4 man 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Otro gran temazo, grandes! saludos desde Colombia
John is back. I can’t believe it 🥲
THEY ARE FUCKING BACK
esto es mágico que bello empezar el año con esto
Amazing♥️
Gran tema, es emocionante verlos de vuelta 😍🤟, tengo el mismo sentimiento y emoción como cuando escuche a la banda por primera vez en el 2006 a mis 10 años viendo Dani California en MTV.
Glad the RHCP are doing well; the last bastion of really great music.
One of the greatest bands of all time
Let's GOOOOO!!!!! It's time! It's TIIIIIMEEEEE!!!
There is no better band ❤️ thank you for beeing so amazing ❤️
🤟
Qué falta nos hacía John
相も変わらずかっこいい
Love
O tão aguardado momento chegou, vcs são demais 🤘🏻🤘🏻🇧🇷
Saludos desde Venezuela ❤️
This is fucking incredible. When these 4 play together there’s such chemistry. It’s honestly amazing. Thank you all of you- It’s pure magic.
Que bien se siente ver a estas leyendas tocar otra vez... 😆
Enfo ❤️
Реклама новой монтажной проги?
Ojala un día lleguen a Bolivia, los amo 🇧🇴
LEGENDS have come back

Love you guys ❤! Amazing music as always! Thank you RHCP! Greetings from Romania! ❤
Very boring song in my opinion. Really disappointing for all the hype leading up.

Great way to start the day 🎈
Qué pedazo de tema!! Recuerda un poco a Stadium Arcadium pero como renovado. Sevilla allá vamos!!!
wait...what? where's the funk? where's the punk-rock? where's the d for dangerous? The solo is great but come on.....
John is back <3 RHCP is back <3

Listening to "Black Summer" during this grey winter 👍👍🍻
GOD FRUSCIANTE
I feel like I am dreaming.. it's been 15 long years!! 🤟
Larga vida a los Red Hot Chili Peppers!   Long live to RHCP ! Long live to the Rock !
Volvieron los RHCP ❤🤘🇦🇷
1:52 Esto se parece mucho a otra canción pero no recuerdo a cuál, siento que por 2 segundos es mu similar.
Good to see John, can’t wait to see them on tour later this year
Red Hot Chilli Peppers O Brasil está aqui 🇧🇷
A song released today on my birthday..... Best present ever 😊
Танцы с голым торсом в шестьдесят — RHCP (с)

Valió la espera por Frusciante ♥
Did someone just put Ecstasy, Paprika, and a Viagra in my cup or did I just hear the song of the year?
Welcome to the old world, John 🍻 (still shiny)
시벌 존푸르시안테 기타왔다? -> 요실금 지림 이 형들은 늙지도 않네.. ㅠㅠ 사랑해요!!  앤소니 이두운동 열심히해ㅔㅆ네
I really hope they're going to tour soon, and come to Memphis.
Tears of joy. Thanks y'all!
Han pasado 6 años desde The Getaway y realmente no importa cuánto tiempo haya pasado, los Red Hot Chili Peppers siempre encontrarán la forma de llegar al corazón de las personas con su característico y, por contradictorio que suene, innovador sonido. En estos tiempos tan difíciles, música como la de ellos es reconfortante y necesaria uwu
No puedo creer que estoy viviendo el 3er regreso de Jesucristo!!!!
John wick
AAAAA es increíble verlos de nuevo a los red hot chili peppers con John frusciante
So much fucking love for these guys <3
Los mejores del universo y de todos los tiempos. Gracias por siempre darnos música que alimenta nuestra alma  y nuestros corazones.  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I didn’t know if I would ever see the day John would join the band again, that they would give us a new album with him - dropping on April fools of course. But I am certainly glad this is not a joke. Rock on
#RHCP🤘🏻🌶🔥🇧🇷
Long Live RHCP!
Com todo respeito ao Josh, mas essa é a banda, o som está totalmente conectado à essa formação. Não dá pra substituir nenhum deles sem perder a personalidade. Não dá pra ouvir Red Hot sem esperar ouvir essa guitarra do John.
0:46 Bro I got so happy when I saw the guitar!!!😭
Stadium Arcadium vibeeees. Lesgooooooo
待っておりました！！！ ジョン大好き❤
John back With his signature Guitar 🎸😍😍😍😍
Frusciante voltou como🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yess im so happy john's come back.....red hot is your home
Thank You for Your creativity.
The lyrics are really bad damn…
What a throwback. This sounds like Stadium Arcadium era. What a pleasure is to see Frusciante back again. I really enjoyed Josh songs and style, but c’mon, this is real RHCP.
THEY HAVE BACK 🌶
Ok,that's excellent
We ❤️ u RHCP
EU TEA AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The Best Californian Music Vibe Ever!!! Love You Guys All of My Heart!!! Thank You!!!
I can never unsee Will Ferrell on the drums.

That music heals my soul. I love you <3
Wowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!

0:49 estas tan hermoso como el día en que te fuiste John 😌❤️🔥
grandeeeeees!!!
go on john, tear a solo, go on john, tear a ... oh shit there it is
Everything is better with John! 🥲
aidan if you see this hello ❣️
THE MAGIC IS BACK!!!!!!
Damn man, but Frusciante just has that sound and rhythm that is so F'n AWESOME that I just cannot get enough of listening to him on that Strat like that!!
John Frusciante and Tool have something in common: 13 years of waiting to release something that is worth such time!
Nueva música de red hot chilli peppers después de tantos años, y con John de vuelta en la banda, esto me hace muy feliz, en cuanto John empezó a tocar el solo no pude evitar sonreír de la emoción y la alegría que me transmite escucharlo de regreso con la banda, son unos putos dioses! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
♡
Feels like the good old days cannot wait for the full album
It finally happened. First stop on planet Peppers. Already loving the new song.
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
É bom ouvir esse solo guitarra de novo 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for coming back John.
Fuck yes
Long life to RHCP!
🌶🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ждали))
We missed you so much John❤️😻🤗
I can’t understand how they can still be so active almost 40 years later, not looking like a parody on themselves as many other groups do.
Grandioso, un estilo Neoclásico 😍😍. Con Jhon Frunsciante en la guitarra, está banda se vuelve en la mejor de toda la historia ,😍👍.
Эх, 12 лет ждали этого момента)) Радует, что Джон звучит вполне по старому, не принес электронщину в новые песни.
love 🙏🖤 form Thailand  I'm19y.
21k views and 40k likes....hell yea
Anthony looking like a tiger king
Лучшие!!!
This song is really good
i grew up listening to these guys, love it. ❤️
After I'm With You and The Getaway I'd like to welcome back the electric guitar into the Chili Peppers sound again. Thanks.
RHCP are chillin' after a long time
Good to see these four dudes back together again💥
Welcome Back !! Fans From Malaysia
Perfect guys ! There’s no other words to describe your performance ! Wouahou!!
RHCP!RHCP!RHCP!RHCP!RHCP!
That solo. Holy shit
Flea - air bender Chad - earth bender John - fire bender Anthony - water bender
I will be at the last show of the 2022 world tour in Dallas, and I couldn't be more exited. These 4 guys just never fail. Beyond hyped.
I love you Red Hot Chili Peppers....i feel your music in my veins!!!....😍
The sound is back!!!! "I've been waitin'..."
So, so good to have John back. Just sounds right. Amazing
J adore la coupe de cheveux du chanteur, c'est sûrement un hommage à Eddie Guerrero une légende du catch.  Longue vie à se super groupe.
Nooo está re buenardium el tema papaaaaa
ARRRRRRR YA READY KIEDIS
🙏🏽 to have new melodies massage our ears. Stay safe
Wow was surprised John made it to the end of the video without quitting the band.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I would never believe this day would come! New stuff from the Chili Peppers, a feeling that  always hits different.
Just the mather fact what album with John Frusciante was Bad ? Answer 0
WOW! Great band!
Wooooo
Indonesia first coment 🇮🇩
Mis lágrimas 😭😭😭😭 💞😻 Verlos llenos de energía  llena de emoción, espero verlos pronto en Perú .Desde los 14 años los amo ❤️😍  Red hot es un sentimiento más que una banda 💞  A quien no se le hace pequeño el corazón cuando ve todo consumado y otra vez unidos con frusciante 😭💋
That haircut and mustache look dead ass,and I mean that as a compliment
ตำนาน...ดีใจที่พวกคุณกลับมามอบความสุขอีกครั้ง
Me da un aire a "Slow Cheetah", no se en qué exactamente pero me gusta!
This now confirms that Frusciante is the secret ingredient
❤BEST GROUP AROUND THE WORLD❤
Это великолепно! Вы моя любимая группа еще с детства, наслаждался каждой композицией и очень ждал нового альбома))) И тут такой подарок, да еще и Джон вернулся, прежний состав и новое начало.
Josh Klinghoffer blows this guy away
so psyched to see you are back. can’t wait to hear the album! 🥰
Finaly
FIREEEEEEEE!!!!
i likt this
John sounds BIG
🥵
They are doing in a new places musically again it fiils. Something similar but it feels different. A lot of chord changes, like its not rhcp, but still it is. Vocal melody is super interesting, feels like sea chanty in verses. And The theme, "waiting for another Black summer to end" - its like all that lock down hit Anthony too (obviously), although im maybe wrong. Cool song, will listen again to fully get it
A sound so fire!
New music from them is like rain after a drought!
The Red Hots are back !
Great!!!)))
Wow they still got it, and damn they ALL look GREAT!. Wow
The wait was worth it
It's different but I'm liken it !!!
I am crying
Jhon lo hiciste de nuevo
🔥❤️‍🔥
The most consistent band of all time!
Los mejores salude desde Colombia 🇨🇴
Clear Antony voice (a bit electronic?! 🤔) , original RHCP sound, but though less Flea's bass parts and few loud Chad drums as well... Welcome back, John! And let's listen the whole album to jump with the conclusion!
Sick
Volvieron! te das cuenta, cuando sientes ese escalofrió con esta canción, se te eriza la piel y sientes que es el circulo completo. Volvieron señores! los Red hot chili peppers! 🇵🇪
おかえりジョン！！ わたし生きてて良かった！
Joie !
Hell yeah
彼らは私に勇気を与えてくれます
Nunca dejan de ser buenos
Yes!❤️❤️❤️❤️
John fucking killed it
Onestamente ? La mia attesa pretendeva di più . Sembra una canzone che mentre la ascolti, ti dici…. : “ adesso esploderà…” e invece no …
Thanks guys
Quite disappointed about this single to be honest. It sounds very Stadium Arcadium but cheap
Damn that felt so fucking good ❤️
Terrible vocals
I love you! Cosmic dream team. ♾
John’s sound is so distinctive, similar to Jimi Hendrix but %100 his own
😎🤘 Still rocking.
I'm crying, my hero's are back!!!!!
anthony should shave the damn mustache lol
I’ve waited over 6000 days for this moment!!!!!
Welcome back John! This sounds awesome  .. but when did Anthony turn Irish? He sounds a little bit cranberrish. Not bad tho. I'm looking forward to hear the rest.
finalmente 🗿
RHCP with John...😢
Hope flea wears that poncho on tour
Su música me salvo la vida ❤️
I've been waiting...
Yes!!! Thanks youuuu!!! Rhcp evolved in another Rhcp and it's Always Goooddd
Felicidad absoluta!!!!Volver a ver a john en la banda Un sueño hecho realidad.. Maravillosos los RHCP los amo!!! I love you john 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
so how does a video with 26K views have 40K likes?
RHCP ♥️
after a long🌚🎧❤
So happy to see John back! Amazing song, can’t wait to see it live!! 🔥
The best band
Frusciante man, Frusciante welcome back :' )
I've been waiting! !!
Anorher perfect song like always!!!!
I’m crying…
All hail John Frusciante
Mediocre song. Not their best. Not bad for a comeback though.
JOHN FRUSCIANTE IS BACK IN DA HAUZ
The best guitar has come back
This blows big ones
This sounds so much better than the new music that is being released by other artists. I just can't get into most of the mainstream stuff that people listen to today, but this - THIS is a sound that I recognize, something I can vibe with! RHCP sound just as good as ever and dang, Anthony is looking mighty fine and fit! 💪🏻🥵🤤😍  I can't wait for the full album!!! ♥️♥️♥️🌶️🔥
Кто вобще мог поставить дизлайки?
Another masterpiece!!
Very sad to see the legendary funk rockers continue to descend into this forgettable generic pop over the last 20 years, essentially, two different bands: Red Hot half with the amazing former 6 albums, & Chili Peppers with the latter 6 lame pop albums - meh.
The song is cool, I liked it. I generally like all your songs)
This is bad :))
YOOOOOOOO
All these comments in different languages ​​tell you everything. This band is EVERYTHING to EVERYBODY.
This is beautiful! Thanks for this! I love you guys!
❤️❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Welcome back John 😍
IT'S AMAZING!!!😍 THEY'RE RED HOT!!!❤🔥🌶
🤙🤙
We have simultaneously progressed and regressed much since the Great Depression.
ohhhhh omg! ESA GUITARRA DE FRUSCIANTE LPM
В лучших традициях) подняли настроение на будущее, спасибо 👍
Welcome back John Frusciante! I felt like in 90's again
Kurwa John, jak ja za tobą tęskniłem
Here we Go again!THX for ther great music
Yes, good old Peppers are back.
RHCP hasn’t lost their touch!
Eu tô me tremendo todaaaaaa 😍😍😍😍
Today's a good day
Let’s gooo
Anddddd John is back, ladies and gentleman! 🙌👌🤘
Wowww
I love this 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
wellcome john 🤣🤣🙏🙋🏻‍♂️
😍😍😍
Nice to see them again. But as a fan since californication, I just observed that this is not a catchy song. It sounds like recycled. I know they are maintaining a signature sound but most of the older rhcp fans has also evolved in musical interest/taste. Im JF fan but at the same time I also missed the sound of Josh. Fuzzy, gritty, scratchy JF sound is not just for me anymore. Wish you the best RHCP. Universe, Jesus, Allah, Buddah and all the other gods bless you.
Incroyablement bon, enfin de la vraie musique 🤤😍💋💜
Cheeky little sea shanty cheers guys
Jajajjaja estoy imparable con esta canción ,tan feliz , no dormire :))
I'm 16 years old again :')
Muita emoção agora , curtir essa nova música com uma pessoa que eu amo muitooooooo 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Great song, guys! Thank you! Interesting sticker on Flea guitar. Привет из России )
2:36 AK fã do Gabigol? 😳 Entenda o caso
Omg!!! I have always loved you! I will always love you!!!
Eu amo RHCP They never lose the essence!
Os caras voltaram com tudo.... inexplicavel o qual bom está a musica!! Parabens!! Um abraço de São Luis-Ma , Brasil!!
I feel Stadium Arcadium vibes in this album and I love it! I never thought it would be possible to refine a master piece but you guys have just prove me wrong! John is back and you can feel all his love already. 🤘🏻❣️
Anthony rockin’ that mullet and flea that poncho ❤️
OMG 😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍
Es increíble que Anthony siga estando igual de mamado a sus 59 años xd
Amazing 🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥
WOW!
Anthony showing off his biceps at 02.38 💪
Red Hot Chilli Planet 😍🔥
They reached their peak
F I N A L L Y ❤❤❤
YYYYYEEEEAAAAHHH!
menua bersama mereka wkwkw
うわーーーーーーお！！！！！！！ 遂に、、、聴ける日が、、 発売日が待ち遠しいーーーー！！！！
this is so powerful, exposes the truth. fuck I love the rhcp. welcome back jesus
i love all four of these guys, the song is straight fire too, but why does Kiedis sound like two kids are trying to steal his lucky charms
More than a decade waiting for this moment, I am overwhelmed with emotion when listening to a new solo by Jhon and how it complements Flea perfectly. John's back vocals are something that few notice but they give him the touch. CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice
Perfect song for the return
幸せだ。感動に心から感謝。
Today is a beautiful day!
Glad to see Will Ferrell is still with the band.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Grandes mis ídolos, si esta canción está genial no se como será el álbum en general😎✨
Nice to hear a new song from you guys, I'm excited for the album!
Quem é esse guitarrista novo? Parece ter talento
ずっと待ってた！！！！！

Hermosa canción ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They ur old.boring.
Nice
They still got it, as if there were any doubt
We needed this! Thank you! Let's rock again!
È godopoli. Finally!
damn waited so long for this
I was just taken back to 1992, I'm a senior in high school wearing a tshirt with leggings, flannel shirt tied around my waist, Doc Martins boots on my feet. I'm heading to the skate ramp to watch local boys play. Life was good, this, life is good. Great song boys, glad RHCP is back ❤
Mantab klo ini mah....
Me lloro!!!!! Los amooo♥️♥️♥️♥️
Anthony looks like a hippy/pirate Ned Flanders.
Finally.
This album is gonna be special. I’m so glad John is back!!! I loved Josh, but it wasn’t the same without John.
This feels historic 🤯
Yeahhh!
I love you chillis!!! Sounds great! Oh yeah it's so fuckin' gooooooddddd
RHCP NEVER MISSES
amor e felicidade, de uma maneira revigorante o abraço de vocês me resgatou de um poço de ansiedade... mais uma vez, obrigado RHCP a minha vida é melhor com vocês,
Do black summers have black hole suns? 🤔
Such a nostalgic feeling listening to this band
OH MY GOD
lo mejor del 2022 hasta ahora
Resumen global. Gracias RHCP. Temazo

i haven’t been so happy or excited about something in a long time. it’s almost nostalgic for me. takes me back to simpler times- times i greatly miss. i have so many amazing and beautiful memories associated with this band. can’t wait to make more with what’s to come.
Yeahhhhh lets go red hot 4 ever !
🙌🏼Holy shiiit! Life made! 🙌🏼

Ребята, вы лучшие
Muy bueno red hot desde Berazategui abrazos mostro

Impresionante... Feliz por verlos y escuchar su hermosa música . Gracias por ser mí banda favorita y siempre ser referente en la música ... Red Hot por for ever
I’m still starving 🤘🌶
That’s the way lads!! 👍😉🥷
I started to cry when I heard that "John" solo. . . Welcome back
Tuve la oportunidad de verlos en vivo acá en chile el 2018, obviamente en ese entonces Josh estaba en la guitarra. Y en serio, muchas gracias a Josh por lo que le aportó a la banda, pero extrañaba esta energía que hay con John, la dinámica entre los 4 es inigualable, transmitiendo tanto amor y unión a través de la música. Creo que solté una lágrima en el momento que comienzan a aparecer todos juntos tocando en el video 🥲  MUCHAS GRACIAS DESDE CHILE!!! 🇨🇱🌶 ❤
Love it
Listo un tema que voy a escuchar mil veces
Frusciante  is BACK
There is never enough Red Hot Chili Peppers music. I'm so happy to be gifted more.
Better late than never
I think I liked everything except Anthony's harshly auto tuned vocals
si, volvieron
Welcome back John!
RHCP CONTINUA FODA PRA KRL NMRL, AS MÚSICAS SÃO TODAS DIFERENTES MAS O ESTILO CONTINUA O MSM, Q BANDA FODA🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Frucciante 🙏🇺🇸
Very Nice!🔥
LA LOCURAAAA!!!, PARECE UN SUEÑO!!! VOLVIERON!! 🤘
Sadly I dont like it (but the guitar is good) and great that they are back
No sé ustedes, pero ya es la 3era vez consecutiva que escucho la canción. Quedé re manija.
You know how I feel now ♥
So classic , So much love!!
They getting old ;-;
froooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh
Came for the new song, stayed for the guitar solo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yessssss
After so long without John, after an entire pandemic, after all the trials and tribulation that we, collectively, have endured, this is the medicine that needs to be prescribed to everyone to heal our hearts, our ears, and by God our souls. If music is medicine, The Red Hot Chili Peppers can cure cancer.
Esto es lo mejor que he escuchado!🤯🌶✳️❤️🔥
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
X DIOS LOS QUIERO VENGAN A ARG JOHN HACEME UN PIBE
Siempre los mejores, no cabe duda que John está de regreso… toda la esencia de RHCP ♥️♥️♥️
El rey ah vuelto lml , la guitarra electrica está salvada
Thank you so much RHCP, Love you guys!!
A new Chili Peppers song will ALWAYS feel special on that first hearing. This just feels right.
Ese Silverio sigue rifando. xd  Ya fuera de broma, que buena rola.
Well the same old boring song of Rhcp! I wouldn't expect something else!

Such a good song!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Xè quina maravilla! Una cançò que significa molt, este àlbum va a ser la canya!
Gracias 🤩💗
Necesitaba ver a los 4 juntos otra vez! 🥲
Great as all RHCP songs; easy to get in but hard to get out of our heads!!
First 9 seconds amazing. Then a someone doing an impression of a pirate  singing starts. Awful
Let’s go found my next album to obsess about🌶🔥🌶🔥🔥
Lagas na ak!
Que se filtre todo el álbum que ya no aguanto más las ganas de escuchar las demás canciones :-) que buen tema <3
Loving it, it sounds like them with a distinct sense of having grown and evolved.  I respect that there was little to zero marketing for this new release, it really is all about the music. <3
I just woke up a couple of minutes ago and I see this. Better than breakfast!
Miss you john, welcome back!!!
that's nice . Welcome beck red hot chilli peppers.
I’ve waited so long for this beautiful moment
Dałem 👍w ciemno

Pre-ordered!
It's kind a generic song, but it is a bless to hear Frusciante playin again with the band again, anyways by the way, and stadium arcadium, hope to listen to the new album. <3
johnnnnnnn!!!!!
Brasil
Finally Good music
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Creo que despues de que frusciante abandone la banda 2 veces, se nos hacia algo bastante dificil el solo hecho de pensar en que los volveriamos a ver con la formacion iconica de anthony, flea, john y chad. Con todos los respetos a Josh estos años, ha sido un gran guitarrista y gracias a el, la banda se mantuvo viva por mas de una decada. Aun asi, desde luego que no eran lo mismo sin ese aura de Frusciante en la guitarra y Rubin como productor. No tenian el mismo sentimiento que en BSSM, Californication, By the way o Stadium Arcadium. Pese a eso, john volvió y uno podria pensar que seria dificil que mantengan tras tanto tiempo esa vibra que tuvo siempre la banda. Pero aqui estamos, siguen sonando igual que hace mas de 20 años. Emociona verlos devuelta. Intactos. Que lindo vivir esto y poder compartirlo sin ser el unico que lo valora tanto. Larga vida a los Chili Pepper's!
Bed cot Philly papers? Red Hot Chili Peppers!
Best thing about 2022 so far, am I right???
I really missed you guys. Finally we had a new song
❤️🙏🏻
A few years ago I never would’ve believed this day would come. There’s just something so magical that happens when these 4 play together.
klklk
That unmistakable magic is back. And that opening riff…🤤🤤🤤 knew I’d love it from that little teaser the other day!
Fruciante is a God!
2:30 de la madrugada hora Argentina que emocionnnnnn
Best gift to wake up to 🇸🇪🙌🏼
I just cried because of Frusciante 🖤
Love Flea's mexican poncho!!
as good wines improve with age, flea was right anthony is one of the best living poets, and the eternal detail of rhcp using L.A as a background, it will be amazing to hear full unlimited love,John, Anthony, Chad and Flea together again
<3
john frusiante
Esses 4 nasceram para tocar juntos <3
Coisa linda! John e a mesma essência das antigas 😍😭 Só veeeeeem 🇧🇷
QUE LOCURA DE TEMA  VIVA EL ROCK!
Bradock minha eterna banda! Arrasta pra cima 🔥
Sounds so so good. Love you guys.
I was 11 the first time I heard any RHCP song (probably Otherside or Californication). I'm 22 now so I never had the opportunity to enjoy John while he was in the band. To me this feels like being 11 again enjoying those Californication tracks for the first time.   Long live the Peppers. Long live Anthony, Chad, John and Flea.
I've been really waiting for a new song from you!
Rather listen to the roux'd  insurrection  song instead of this !!!  https://youtu.be/cOSQHYk3Rqk
A new song about California?
ctm pedazo de canción!!!! la mejor banda de todas
the bassist has a portrait of Vladimir Lenin on the bass???
Just a minute and 52 seconds in the song until I get the reminder that it's all worth it....
Fuck I've missed this sound welcome back John the stars can align again omg what a song ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Siempre creí en que podrían volver a estar juntos, Anthony, Michael, Chad y John, les debo 20 años de mi vida escuchándolos sin parar, RHCP por siempre <3
THEY ARE YOUNG OF HEART <3
2022 ,23,24,25...
Can’t wait to see my favorite band in the world live in April #blacksummer
I did not expect a new song.
Yeaaaaaaaaaa un gusto verlos chicos (^^)
Anthony è in forma perfetta..
新曲ですか！？
JOHN FRUSCIANTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
FULL SMILE I LOVE THIS
Amazing 🤩 Just f…g amazing 🤩
As if Fortune Faded had had a son with The Zephyr Song.
Luv the vibe fellas.
I've waited 13 years to see you there again, Mr F, Sir Frusciante. Thank you for making me remember those damn bendings and make a guitar cry in the Name of the Rock  He esperado 13 años para volver a verte ahí, Mr F , Sir Frusciante. Gracias por hacerme recordar esos malditos bendings y hacer llorar una guitarra en el nombre el Rock.
Finallyyyyy 😍😍😍😍😍

Some of these guys are almost 60 and still rockin'🕺and John on guitar 🤘 I was also born in 1962 like Anthony and Flea and have been an RCHP fan since the 80's.
John Frusciante is amazing.
Toda su discografía en una sola canción.!
You ROCK! Great new tune!  We're a new band, you might dig our tune "Jekyll & Hyde"?
THIS. FUCKING. RULES.
Jodeeer, han pasado 6 años recuerdo cuando salió el último álbum en 2016 estaba en la secundaria, mis amigos y yo estábamos obsesionados con los de California hasta alucinados tocábamos con calcetines en la gampi jajaja Frusciante le da ese toque especial cual pimienta en una pizza, increíble, solo pido que esto no termine, Perú los espera🇵🇪♥️🤙🏻  #RedHotChiliPeppers
Man is it good to have John back in the band!
LOS RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ESTÁN DE VUELTA 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Anthony killing it as always 💙💕🖤
Caraca! Clip novo! O Frusciante dá outra cara pra banda. Finalmente a guitarra voltou a brilhar.
Glad to hear the warm deep tone of John's guitar. The song is great, but it's only their lead single. I can't wait to hear track 11 or 12 on their new album. That's where the juiciest peppers are.
Wowwwwww
Eu esperei por esse momento como uma mãe espera pelo nascimento de seu primeiro filho 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
ABENÇOA JESUS
Tooooppp red hot chili peppers with the great return of John frusciante
Still cool)
They're back 🤟
Absolutely spine tingling......been a while but worth it as we all knew it would be
Temardo, RHCP son grandes!
fucken EH!
They are back👍😀👍
¡Épico! Escucharlos desde los 10 años y con esta canción volver a esos años, ¡este sonido con John es único!
Emozionanti, RHCP🔝🔝🔝
Hasta el cielo L.E.H  3/02/22 3 P.M.

Why does Anthony Kiedis not age
Wow o my God is spettacular
JOHN FUCKING FRUSCIANTE!

Casi lloro de la emoción, la verdad es increíble como siempre surgen nuevas ideas y nunca pierden la escénica, gracias RHCP por hacer mejor todos mis días Your are The ones than make me feel better Saludos de Mendoza Argentina 🌶️
Bullshit. The musicians behind all of Exotic Joe's tracks are actually Vince Johnson and singer Danny Clinton, both of whom appear in Tiger King's credits.
I can’t believe I’m watching this right now , posted an hour ago yet everything I needed at this moment
Ok, my husband is crying. Great song and video guys 💙
Gracias por seguir haciendo música siempre fieles a su escencia. Black Summer me hizo llorar. Ver a San John Frusciante de nuevo es ver el regreso de un héroe, un ídolo, un Dios. ❤🇲🇽
1:34 2:36
My man frusciante is bk ... song of the year already
YES!!!!!!! my boys are back! :)
❤️John is back - John is back- John is back -  John is back - John is back- John is back-John is back - John is back- John is back- John is back - John is back John is back - John is back - John is back- John is back - John is back - John is back- John is back❤️

It is so beautiful that those guys are my companions in my journey of life.
John ❤
QUE SENSAÇÃO MARAVILHOSA DE VER E OUVIR ISSO!
Phoenix has rose once again to the sound of john's riffs!
Too amazing (Hello John!)
Welcome back mr. Frusciante!
90 is back
Have been waiting for this for sooooooo long😍
Já agradeceram hj por estarem vivos pra apreciar essa banda?? Foda demais 💛🇧🇷🇧🇷
So happy to see them all back together... Been listening to them since I was a kid, they keep getting better and better!
Thank you Frusciante for rejoining 🤜🤛
I know that John has the 60% of the RHCP soul and blood
This was pure Magic, this is awesome!!! I love you John, great to see you in the band again. I almost cry! ❤️
Felt like I met with an old friend when I see John.
Welcome back John! 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing, this sound is wonderful! Long live the peppers! I love you so much
Good sound. Kinda reminded me of the "By The Way" days!!! I'm so happy John is back. Makes my heart leap with happiness.
JOHN FRUSCIANTE OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG
This great band is creating always great songs and always they're perfectly performed them with this unique and wonderful style......!!!!!!!!
Vou infartar nesse álbum
I hate when people compare frusciante to Jesus, he’s great and all but he’s no frusciante
CANT  WAIT TO SEE YOU IN JUNE (LOS ANGELES BBY) 🧡
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Esperamos mucho tiempo para tener a Frusciante de vuelta en las filas de los Red Hot, tengan por seguro que este album no decepcionará. ❤️
Nunca decepcionaram pqp!! Q som foda 😍
After all these years, all these ups and downs…to see the same four guys from Mother’s Milk and Blood Sugar putting out great material is really astonishing. Not many bands have that type of staying power. *Major* respect to the Dave and Josh for holding it down when John’s gone away 👍
Jancok tetep selalu sangar om om ini 🔥
Ay mi corazón 🤩 qué alegría ,espere años por estooo juntos de nuevo 🙏😍😍🙏🙏😍😍😍😍😍
This single is worse than the worst song on The Getaway. Josh snd DangerMouse gave them freshness and new ideas, which seem to have disappeared with John and Rubin. This is a filler, not a first single of a new album.
🥺🥺🥺 ✳️✳️✳️
Welcome back Red God Chilli peppers
YEAH!!! Welcome back, John! This is great!
The king has returned.
I'm not crying, you are-
Thank God for the Red Hot Chili Peppers!
AMAZING!!!
Спасибо!
O Red Hot voltouuuuuuuu... O Red Hot voltouuuuuu, ôhhhhhhh.
AMAZING GUYS ❤❤
Yes.
that guitar solo!  nice vocal harmonies!  chorus surprised me!  i dig it.
I will see Frusciante and go, worth to see.
1:26 Anthony siendo Anthony
frusciante besame
Jhon le da ese toque tan característico a la banda con esa guitarra y coros tan armoniosos lo que nos espera después de tanto gracias !!!
ITS AMAAAZING  , THEEE TRUE GUITARRIST  IS BAAAAACK⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Anthony's embracing his inner Iggy Pop.

Actually geeking out that frusciante is back strumming the strings dude. What an amazing comeback song.
Emotional seeing John back on his guitar.✌️
LET'S dingdangdongdongdingdangdongdongdingdang GO!!!! 🔥
This feels like a culmination of what the group has learned through all their previous albums. John hits different and I can't wait for the album to drop!
Total BANGER !!
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry  Cremation takes its piece of your supply
ME VUELVOOOO LOOOCOOOOOO 🥂❤️💥
Exactly what I needed right now
Where is the damn heavy stuff come on guys this is like boring soft rock
The music and guitar itself is very good, however Kiedis’s cranked up vocals kinda sucks.
Me encanta Flea siempre tan destacable con sus looks y que junto a Anthony nunca pueden llevar camiseta puesta jajajaja
welcome home Frusciante!
Slow Cheetah vibes. Wow!! We love you John!! ❤️
Gooood
Great Super Very Awesome! Thank you! Athony Flea John Chad and All Staff!
Aunque pasen los años siempre serán los mejores 😍
I find this song very calming yet head banging <3
Hearing Frusciante's backing vocals on chorus brought me tears :,)
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Quiero llorar... 🥲
🤩🎸💪
♡very john tune♡

🖤
Оооо, как же это круто, эта музыка победит коронавирус!
Brasil, motherfuckers ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Obrigado Deus por estar vivo pra ver isso acontecer de novo 🙏🏻❤

Finally, the real Peppers are back
Such my kiss bitches...nailed it, gentlemen. So glad to see/hear the matchless Jonh Frusciante back!!
I AM SO EXCITED!
ジョンのギターは歌ってる。音から感情が言葉のように伝わってくる。もう二度とこの四人が一緒に演っているところは観れないと思っていた。四人で音楽と向き合って、誰よりも彼ら自身がそれを楽しんで、そこから生まれたものを世の中に出してくれた。こんな嬉しいことはない。
✳️ The family is back together.
These are the chili peppers i waited 10 years for 🥲🥲💙💙💙
Hell, yeah! Frusciante is back! Rock out, peeps!!!!!
Viva RHCP 🇧🇷🇧🇷🤘🏻
When do they gonna come to México, that's my doubt for sure
Oh Frusciante, my apple pie!
Loveee YOU Red Hot Chili Peppers from Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
This music video perfectly fits the song. Can't wait for the whole album!

Fruscianteeeeeeeeeee❤️❤️❤️❤️
PERFECTION
Mi salud mental se los agradece.
JOHN IS BACK MFS
Good to see John Frusciante with them. And Will Ferrell killing it on drums as always.
Sounds great!
Good no?
Listened to it like 25 times in a row already. I think if I were deaf I'd still be able to hear these 4 playing
With John’s come back it’s just pure magic, I can’t wait to listen the hole album and see them live and reunited for the first time in so many years!!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍
I don’t know how to explain it, but you listen to the incredibly beautiful and explosive Black Summer and you understand the world has come into balance John Frusciante makes a masterpiece for RHCP
Prêt pour chanter le 8 juillet 2022 Stade de france! Merci!
Happy to hear and see them back together <3
Oh wow
Крутяк🙌
The RHCP are back
My goodness, as soon as John started playing the opening riff on guitar, I started to feel every joyful emotion known to man. This, this right here, is why I have always loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers and their music. It doesn’t get more quintessential than this. Can’t wait for the new album and especially their SD show in July.
Tryna do the song of the summe
im gay
This shit slaps.
It's so fucking beautiful
Ah I love this song ! It is a long long time I haven’t listened to them ...maybe since Californication ? I can’t even remember ,I was a fan since nearly the start ... I don’t know exactly why our paths have diverged ... but I am so happy they are still here making their amazing music .... seeing them playing music is a really comforting thing  .
Vibe of Californication. I like it
Perfect! 🤤🇧🇷
Anthony's voice is sounding the best it's ever been!!!!!
I still feel like they just kick josh so fucking bad !!! Of the red hot hilli
Que VIVA EL PUTOOOOOO ROCKKKKKKK, A LA VERGA NUNCA MORIRA EL PUTO ROCK...... DIOSES LOS RED SIMPLEMENTE DIOSES... NADA MÁS QUE DECIR 🇵🇦
Sweet Jesus we’re back…

Welcome back guys ❣️
THE VIBES OMGGG RHCP IS BAACCKKK
Comentei com Uma hora de lançamento, kkkk, vamos ver as curtidas daqui a um ano.
They’re one with the universe 🛐
Gah. Nice. This is one of those songs that just feels like home. Like it’s always been there. No offence to Josh but I’ve been hanging for this since John left. Love it.
The amount of languages in this comment section speaks volumes of not only what music can do but with these 4 guys can do. Thank you peppers 🙏🏻❤️❤️
:') I'm happy ^^ this has been a journey
OMG
Wowow, just one hour, and 25k views
Back in the gameeee❤️
Brings me back to Stadium Arcadium. 🥲
It didn't really sound like the RHCP...and then the drums came in.
Josh Klinghoffer did his best and we thank him infinitely for it.
Incrivelmente perfeito
Oh no, they are spicing it up again, the Red Hot Chili Pepper's are back!
They are back!!!🌶️🌶️🌶️
No paso ni un segundo y estoy llorando de la emoción  Los amo guyssss
Nice to see Will Ferrell still drumming away.
Anthony: tlacuache cuh

0:48 the chili peppers are so legendary they got John wick to play for them!!
This song came out the morning of my birthday. I found my favourite spot in the garden, and put on my headphones to listen. By the time John launched into his first solo I was jumping and dancing around the garden, with only the sunrise to watch me. Welcome back John, I’ve missed you.
Sublime cancion me alegra estar aqui presenciando esta rola vivan los red hot chilli pepers
Pasan los años , creces y escuchar nueva música de ellos te hace volver al pasado y sentirte un niño/adolescente nuevamente que descubre sus canciones. Simplemente gracias❤️🖤❤️

Amigos, me emociona muchísimo cada que los Red Hot sacan nueva música, y esta ocasión en especial, ya verlos más avanzados de edad, pero conservando su sonido tan fresco y con Frusciante de regreso... me hizo brotar una lágrima ✨
Muchas gracias ❤️

En mundo absorvido por música mainstream, dónde el rock anda desapercibida, aparece estos señores demostrando que su música trasciende. Definitivamente los RHCP vuelven a su escencia con John en la guitarra, por lo que siento este álbum va apelar a tocar nuestra nostalgia 90tera. Son grandes chicos exitos!
More likes than views YouTube is broken again
THE GOOD OL' PEPPERS ARE BACK IN THE PLAY BABEEEEEEE
Mis viejos, siempre respetando su estilo ✨👏
Смотрю РЭДОВ лет 35. Восхищаюсь Их свободе. Ещё с  90 х  В СССР они звучали. Мало клипов.

I'm glad to see them alive and well after the pandemic.
😘😘🥰🥰😍😍💖💗✳ I'm waiting for this  yes!!

only one thing missing California
Welcome back John
Like dreams come true.. the man is back
Грандиозное произведение, рад как ребенок! Уже раз 20 прослушал.
I hope John gets out alive again before these guys use him up and toss him aside again
Duuude, I missed this backing vocals and guitar lines so much... Welcome back John
Как же долго я ждала!!!! Спасибо, что вы есть!!!! 😍😍😍
El tan esperado día llegó!!!ver a John otra vez en la banda me hace inmensamente feliz, lo máximo que la música actual puede dar en cuanto a lo artístico es este hombre en las seis cuerdas!!!

Muito ruim, pelo menos essa né, lembrando que é minha opinião, bjs
Valió la pena la espera, promete ser un gran disco, vengan pronto a México
There're back ! 🥰
One of my favorite bands ever top three easily because there’s never been a time in my life that there wasn’t an appropriate chili peppers song for at that moment
Después de tanta espera de que se anunció el regreso de frusciante, estaba ansioso por escuchar algo nuevo de los red hot chilli peppers, me dieron incluso ganas de llorar, no me tocaron los 80, ni los 90 y en los 2000 apenas era un niño, a toda mi familia le encanta esta banda, estoy muy feliz de saber que ahora yo seré el adolescente que viva esta nueva era ❤️
The gangs all back together ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇻🇪
I can’t believe am alive to see this
only the best
Barber: "What kind of cut?" Anthony: "Fuck my shit up."
Te amo Frusciante, que bien le haces a los RHCP ❤️
🖤
I feel new spirit with the same energy. Long live! Thanks John to comeback!
Best news of all, I just love it. ❤️❤️❤️ Greetings from the Czech Republic 🤘🤘🤘
We are all sharing the same love and excitement just as you guys and want to thank God for this wonderful experience we can be part of as one big red hot family❤️
Te amo Frusciante Sabélo carajo!!!!
I will always be excited to see a RHCP release, another absolute BOP!
los amo un monton
If you want to describe the original chili peppers sound put this song!
Hello from Russia, Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!!
Red Hot causa um sentimento em mim, que não sei nem como chamar. O tanto que eu fiquei ansiosa pra esse lançamento, até parece que estou me preparando pra ir pro show deles!
I love this so much
Y bueno aquí vamos otra vez ... Montemonos de nuevo a esta ola y esperemos q no sea la última ...
16 años espere esto! Lo volvieron hacer los ijosdput4! De nuevo la mejor banda del mundo hace su aparición con esta joya! RHCP forever!  Vengan a México!

The part where flea gets out the paintbrush for johns solo and they are all shown playing together at the end made me get a bit emotional

This song made me feel like 5 emotions listening to it. Grateful, hopeful, nostalgic, peaceful… wow! They took their time and I thank them for that.
nova musica mesma harmonia que top redhot e melhor sem duvidas
The beginning sounds irish/ scottish to me. Anthonys voice is absolutly amazing!
Me acompañaron en cada etapa de mi vida y lo siguen haciendo. Desde los 12 años que los sigo y se sigue sintiendo la misma vibra.  ¡Frusciante is back!  ¡RHCT are back!  🥰
best band rn by far
Russian epic, spirit, fields…
I've been a fan forever, but when it comes to guitar, I'm a fanatic. Welcome back, John!
Momento mágico para quem acompanha essa banda há tempos!! Obrigado Frusciante, obrigado a todos por se reunirem na melhor formação da história da banda mais importante da minha vida ❤️

Realmente o rock nunca morre! (Sobrevive usando respiradores, mas não morre)
Amazing!!! Your music always sounds fresh.
He is back for good
La mejor banda de este puto mundo....ojalá me alcance la vida, para poder verlos así sea una sola vez....por siempre RHCP
John Frusciante is back! ♥️ The prodigy sons of L.A
I love it 🧡
Esperábamos con ansias esto!
Musica que sana y alimenta el alma, en tiempos tan complicados  solo unos genios pueden rellenar tu batería interna. Josh era genial, pero John ese sujeto es celestial..  la pieza que faltaba
Fresh and crispy, keep it up! 🎸👍
Desde a hora que Black Summer foi lançada eu não consigo parar de chorar 😭❤ Muita felicidade, um misto de emoção, a volta do Jonh, esse solo que ele faz no meio da música, a sintonia do quarteto, uma nostalgia de clipes antigos, voltei no passado quando eu vi RHCP pela primeira vez quando não sabia ainda nem falar direito kkk sou grato por estar vivendo esse momento, uma nova era kralhooo, Red Hot Chilli Peppers no topo 👏🏼🔥🌶❤🇧🇷
Nah amigo que loco todos esperando al viernes para mas ifno y kboom que sale nuevo rolon de Antonio y los picantes lmao jsjsjsjs épico
おかえり。ジョン
GOOD OLD RHCP
LOVE YOU GOUYSS YOU"RE D BEST
Anthony told his barber to give him the Julian Casablancas.
lets goooooooo
God save the RHCP
Is Anthony singing with an Irish accent or something.
So much to process and so many thoughts! First: looking fit - even with a mullet! Second - really enjoy the revamped 60's vibe! Third - sounds like a new classic RHCP song!   Knocked this one out of the park!
Pretty solid! John Frusciante is back, baby!!!
Hands down one of the best formations in rock and roll's history, and it is here for us again. So good to be alive!
❤❤❤
So happy to see John back, overwhelmed with emotion
Apenas 22k vistas, me siento afortunado
Tears. All i have to say…

The best band of word! ✳️
Bentornati amori miei

This band help me so much when my father died until this day they keep on help me with your music and it's amazing John is back again i hope forever
It brings me so much comfort knowing these guys are still in shape, and Kiedis still takes his shirt off and is ripped.
Finally!!!! Cannot wait 4 the album!!!!
Sustained Greatness! 👍🏻 Mad Respect!

Welcome back John
Al fin la espera ha terminado amigos!, me genera una alegría enorme tener de vuelta a John Frusciante con los RHCP. Mil gracias. 🇲🇽
Bravo
Damn Frusiciante is a legend.
1:50 Frusciante is back!! 🔥💥♥️🎸🎸
Joooooooooooohnnn!!!!!
That’s John Anthony Frusciante
Amazing this energy ❤️.
Awesome 🔥🔥❤️❤️
It's good to see and hear Mr. Frusciante 🎸🎶 as for the whole band, sounds the same as always.
Red Hot ❤️🇧🇷  Amo muito, música foda 🤩😍
Bravo
There is a tone only for this band.  There was a tone that hasn't changed for years, and the tone seems blurry, but I'm glad it's back again.  It doesn't overlap with anyone!  Our 60s Homi who support us!
Sorry, I dont like it. Been following you since MothersMilk, every album was a new direction. THIS IS CONFORT ZONE. (Maybe Rubin was not the ideal guy for this era).
This gives me vibes from Stadium Arcadium
HOJE EU NÃO VOU DORMIR!!!!!! 😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Tak macie grać do końca świata i jeden dzień dłużej
❤️
Is that Jesus or John Frusciante?
Good．
This definitely had that "no quarter " sound by led zeppelin in the beginning.. Great vibes and introduction thay only John can create with such beauty.
Long have I waited. Brabos dos brabos
LETS GOOOOOOO! The Getaway was a masterpiece I can’t wait to hear this LP as a whole
Perú presente 🌶️🤘🏻🇵🇪
Love ❤❤❤❤❤
Que alegría escucharlos de nuevo. La Mejor Banda de Rock!!!
What a lovely day!
Fucken sick
Vamos los Red Hot!! la formacion que todos llevamos en el corazon! este single es lo mas!
Wonderful!!! 👌
Feel like 1999...i like this Californication mood
Johnny is back, fuck yes!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Finally after 16 years 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Shoutout the people still listening to this song in 2022!!

SALAM DARI BANJARMASIN INDONESIA BRADER...

Aguante John y los Red hot, vengan a Colombia!!!!
Home
i'm so happy
3/10 🤔
holy fuck
Forever my favorite band
I'm not crying ... you're crying
okay that was fucking good
You can't dislike a song if the John Wick plays on guitar
Just a minute and a half took Anthony to end shirtless, awesome
JOHN IS BACK!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
John Frusiciante is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You're the best, keep the dream alive! Saludos desde Costa Rica. We are waiting for you ❤ 🇨🇷🤘🏻
And that spirit is called RHCP 😌💖💖💖
RHCP nunca me decepcionan !! Tengo casi toda mi vida escuchándolos y cada nuevo álbum es emocionante para mi ! Gracias john por regresar y gracias josh por ese aporte que diste ala banda !! 🇲🇽
涙がでる。。大好きです。日本にも来てください。
🥲
K A R A L H O🤤
Los quiero mucho, gracias por estas bellas melodías, no hace mucho alguien muy querido que me encantaba su música falleció y les agradezco que hayan sido parte de su vida ❤❤ y de la mía
Gracias por esta joya!!
Well, that was just sick.    The black summer has ended.
<33
Это замечательно! Перцы в великолепной форме! Оч круто видеть снова Джона рядом с ними! Великолепно!!!
RHCP terbaik! terima kasih!

I LOVE YOU GUYS
Finally RHCP is back!! 🤘
lovin it
Increíble! Esto es rhcp, extrañabamos mucho esto, que gran banda !!
They look like they are all dying of the AIDS Anthony's mustache caught
Los que decía que era Navarro: 🤡
Despues de tanto tiempo sin John mantienen su estilo y su esencia, y aun mejor parece que su conexión como banda siguen intacta, larga vida a los RHCP❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hahaha just had to take off his shirt as usual! HAHAHAHA amazing
Escucho a los RHCP desde que tengo 9 años, vivo enamorado de esta banda y lo que significa. El regreso de mi maestro John provoca una mezcla de sentimientos que no puedo describir, soy músico gracias a el y todas las horas que pasé encerrado imitandolo y entender la música como el lo hace. Por favor, vengan a Perú 🇵🇪 no saben lo feliz que harían a muchas personas! Los amo! ❤️🌶️
Real Hot Chili Papper
Welcome back the guitar solo's 😭😭😭
IM DYING THANK YOU
bem vindo de volta john
chiliiiiiii
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔴🔥🌶
Ameeee me encanto la canción, me encanto que regresara john  like si también te gustó la canción.!!❤️❤️🥺
🇲🇫🇲🇫🇲🇫🇲🇫🙋‍♂️❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤
Been waiting for so long for John background vocal!
This is NOSTALGIC. I’m sixteen again, Oh My God. See them together, those last scenes where AK took the mic like only he can, the four TOGETHER, there.  Wow, this gave me a kind of a sign that everything can be as cool as it used to be yesterday. This song is a bless. God bless you all and God bless RHCP (all the members they ever had, ‘cause all of them are part of this tremendous HIStory)
poderosos
I never thought I'd be within the first 50,000 people to hear a new Chili Peppers single on YouTube.
Mas de 10 años esperando este mítico momento, el deleite de escuchar esa guitarra... 😭
Anthony Kiedis CANNOT be in his fifties...
La pregunta es,cuando vienen a Latinoamérica?🤔🤔🤔🎸🌶🎶
omg amooooo
wow, 20K views against 24K likes, it's the first time I'm seeing something like that, lol  only means we all smashed that like button before even watching it, cos we know this is going to be goooood 🤠
It is so refreshing to hear Frusciante's "talking" guitar accompanying Kiedis' voice, Chad's Drums and Flea's rhythm once again.
Ustedes son la mejor banda para mí los escucho desde que tenía 12 años ahora tengo 22 y los llevo en mi corazón
somos privilegiados em ver o que está acontecendo!!!
Estan en excelente forma los muchachos
OMG
LETS GOOOO
muerta estoy
You can tell there is such a difference with fruciante it’s crazy. Don’t get me wrong josh was good but John is red hot chilli pepper’s essence and unique free sound, and as always flea always keeping it real with the baseline
Always hits different, always hits the same way.. love u guys <3
I didn’t know how much I missed you guys 💜✨
El arte es invaluable cuando se hace con pación!! 🇵🇪
Excelente
The guitar player reminds me of the old guitar player who reminded me of the old guitar player
So glad I got to see this within an hour of it dropping, and can't wait to see y'all in Michigan in August 😭😭
Eu amo uma banda 🇧🇷
Chad breaking new ground 🤔
Que loco que vivan los red hot chilli papers
Son lo mejor de este maldito mundo!!! Los amo por siempre ❤️‍🔥
BEST BAND IN THE WORLD!
De alguna manera esta Banda me motiva a seguir adelante, los amo Red Hot Chili peppers :,)❤️🤍
finally...
Welcome back Frusciante!! Much love from JAPAN!! Love ya boys!!
Quite generic and forgettable
Aaahhhhhgg
Classic shirtless Tony, funky flea, powerful chad and plaid/strat frusciante. I’m glad my generation will be able to see a release with frusciante.
Amazing👌👍
Increíble , red hot por siempre 🤟🤟
Wow
🥰❤❤❤🌶
Joe Exotic singing.
Amazing
Brasil loves RHCP
Como isso é foda... uma vibe que não dá pra explicar ... RHCP é vida que energia maravilhosa... clipe tá lindo tbm... (Os Br's em peso aqui nos comentários...) 💜💛🤘🌶🌶🤘💛💜
La buena música nunca cambia ni al pasar mas de 20 años!! 🇵🇪
Thanks a lot
Señores el rock está volviendo , mejor dicho nunca se fue
🔥🔥🔥
A LAS 3 DE LA NOCHE SE LES OCURRE SACAR UN NUEVO TEMA CTM ESTOY MÁS FELIZ QUE LA MIERDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Tô apaixonada 😍😍😍😍

🔥❤️
Yes yes yes
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 I love it!! All I want to do is play guitar right now, you can not beat John’s style he’s so inspiring.
Los amo 💕💕💕!!
Amazing, love the intro. We still love your music and the new ones are fire 🔥
Volvieron , que alegría!!!!! 🚀
El día q saquen mala música me suicido
We’ve missed you John! That tone is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo. This is amazing. I’m actually shocked at how good this is! Not that I don’t have high expectations for these guys but wow. This blew me away
I fucking love you guys, rock on welcome back John 🔥🤘
Fucking magical!!!!
this song is giving me stadium arcadium vibes holy shiiiiiit
It’s been a rough few weeks for me personally… However, I jumped up from my couch and started dancing and smiling when that course kicked in! God I’ll always love these guys. This sounded like a deep track that could have been on Californication
La alegría que manejo no se explica!!! La esencia red hot sigue intacta!!! 🌶️🔥
Big Stadium Arcadium vibes 😎
Ahhhh estoy muy feliz. Escuché la guitarra y salté de felicidad.😭😭
Fans peruanos de RHCP 🇵🇪 !!!
The vibes, I love it !!! They never disappoint. See y’all in a couple of months ❤️
Its Classic Rhcp
Thanks RHCP !!!,
nananana épico
♥️♥️♥️
Wow! I like it very much! Very good job RHCP! (Me gusta mucho! Muy buen trabajo RHCP)
this sounds like it could be on Stadium Arcadium, so good
Man finally a track with John as the backup vocals again ! This is and will always b gold
I still can't believe it's really happening! One of the few things left in this world that's going right. And this song gave me goosebumps! Thank you RHCP!
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
love it
10 años esperando esto y por fin, soy feliz de nuevo!
John never lost his sound. Damnnn lit song🔥🔥🔥
Made my day  Again
No disrespect to the other guitarist but the emotion that Frusciante can project in his guitar playing is unmatched, there's a reason this band is just not the same without him period...
I LOVE YOU BORAT!!!!
¡Están de vuelta! ¡John está de vuelta! ¡Es como si el tiempo no hubiera pasado!
El solo de guitarra esa parte la Rompe ! con la autopista de fondo y el final todos los atardeceres ❤
John's guitars is blazing here like always it does! Restoring faith in  music still in 2022.
Una belleza!!!! 🔥❤️🔥
I've waited so long for this. I'm beyond excited, so good. I live way up north and I've only made the trip 800 kms south for three concerts in my life, the chili peppers were 2/3 😅
VOLVIERON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
I had to hit pause a quarter of the way through...
Good old RHCP!! love it!!!
Great song, they’re amazing 🤩❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
"It’s been a long time since I made a new friend." -yep. Quite a while.  These old friends just came by, said hi, it’s ok, you’re not alone in this,  "you never know when".
Never been so early to a music video before lol
I feel happy to have made it to see John rejoin the band, I have manifested this along with many others and now we rejoice!
Not impressed......yet. Will wait for the whole album. Been a fan of theirs since the 90s, so we will see. That mic stand keeps switching places ;)
This song gives Stadium Arcadium Vibes
💪🏻❤️
The sound of the fender strato
que buen video mis panas
Blood Sugar Sex Magic was the shit boy! This sounds like their usual, rehashed, watered down funk-less, drivel, they ain't got the teeth or the fire in their bones anymore, throw in the towel boys, you look like tired old guys going through the motions because that's what the cult of personality dictates...
I will ULTIMATE(LY) LOVE THIS ALBUM! Can’t wait guys! Great job! Looking forward to it :)
Ótima, quero ao vivo no Mineirão
John seems to play in kinda Josh style. Amasing!
Ngl, Anthony is kinda rocking with that mullet
finally.
Acá seguimos los de siempre lml
Heeelllllllll yeeeaaaaaaaa
So glad to have you back ❤️
Music to my ears
Bravo RHCP
I'm in love! Love love love ❤❤❤
“GOT GUNS?” Dayyyyum! @ 2:37
Ótimo Mas poderia ser melhor
JOHN IS BACK!!
THIS IS A PIECE OF ART
What can I say? :')
It could be Sunday.
He didn't skip the gym a single day
JOHN IS BACK PORRAAAAAAAA
"China's on the derk side of the moon"
Hell yea
Nananan no paro de escucharlo
lindo demais
Fui el único que se emocionó como un niño viendo a su héroe otra vez? Cómo es posible que frunsciante le de tanta magia a la banda, es que te llena de emoción el mero hecho de escucharlo y verlo moverse con su estilo tan brutal, me llena el alma volver a escuchar una buena canción de su parte!
Red Hot Boomers still shredding big time.. w/Frusciante ❤
Meh
Siempre llegan en el momento indicado de mi vida, me hacen feliz y lo han venido haciendo desde que los conozco. Son años de buena música y espero que sean muchos más ❤️🇨🇴
USTEDES 4 SON ARTE
INCREIBLES...!!!
Weno, Weno, Weno 🔥🔥🔥
RHCP la mejor banda, mi primer concierto fue ir a verlos a ellos en el By the way tour en el foro sol. Les abrió resorte y P.OD, gratos recuerdos, siempre serán mis bandas favoritas.
Increíble 🔥 por siempre RHCP
I feel like they missed the occasion to make it truly epic with a more agressive part à la Torture Me, or with a gospel/huge choir finale like in Under the Bridge.  It was really good though. Nice guitar tone, solo and bridge, awesome bass and as always solid drums by Chad!
You are the energy for the world
Вы потрясающие музыканты, удачи вам, здоровья и радуйте нас ещё много много лет!
After all these years, they keep going on with so much energy... LEGENDS!!!!
No more depression. Only, Red Hot Chili Peppers- Black Summer (Official Music Video)
Gracias Anthony, Flea, John y Chad por hacer música única y hermosa. Amor ilimitado para ustedes ❤
Yeeeeaaah! Real RCHP!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
dou
Duno
So happy John is back he’s my favorite musician all time !
They never let us down
Decades later, these guys never miss.   Living legends. <3
I've been waiting 😭😭😭
I'm glad I saw this.
Кайф
Will you please come watch the sunrise with me? I will pick you up at FLL. Just call me!
A masterpiece as usual
Perfeitos como sempre
I am here when its still 20,476. ! Before me and my friend part ways we used to jam with red hot. Life goes on no matter what it's just sad I'll be jamming on red hot alone again but thats life and I'm loving peace and loneliness and its addicting.
definitivamente son mi banda favorita siempre sorprendiedonos! 🌶️🔥🌶️🔥🌶️🔥❤️
No dios que cosa tan inesperadamente hermoso, que vivan los red hot chili peppers, los escucho desde que era un niño ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇻🇪🇻🇪
Aaaaaand John Frusciante steals the show! He looks so healthy and vibin so well with the song and band. So glad we all have this to look forward to in these recent dark years <3
Gotta love how everyone’s wearing their classic outfit
John is back! ❤️❤️
So goooood song
It was worth the wait, the chilli's never disappoint, its good to have John frusciante back, looking forward to see you play live in Marlay Park, Dublin in the summer !
Fooodaa demaaaais! Que vibe é essa? Um presente para os fãs! A essência pura do que é o RHCP. Ansioso para as próximas músicas 😍🔥🤘😍🔥🤘😍🔥🤘
Se mamaron! Suena a "casa" suena a ellos.
Hmm man IDK. Can't judge an album off of one song but this ain't it. John's guitar is beautiful but man, those transitions were rough and awkward. Hope is still alive that the next single and the album as a whole is gonna be great.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Os Chili Peppers estão de volta ❤❤❤❤❤
Tuve miedo de haber nacido demasiado tarde para disfrutar de John en la banda pero esta pasando!
60 años el Kiedis y con mas fisico que rocky II
LOS AMO RHCP POR USTEDES LE HECHO GANAS A LA VIDA ❤
Наконец то, дождались,  долго ждали, но как всегда все безупречно,  не зря ждали
I honestly hate that RHCP is this good because I don't want to support a band that is this fucked up (if you don't know, they have loads of stories about sexual harrassment, the singer slept with a 14 year old just to name a few things). It hurts not to listen to them because they're so good, but it also hurts to listen to them because I feel guilty about it. It would be so much easier if they were bad at music too.
can you believe this band has literally been around for almost 40 years
❤️❤️❤️  Thank you John!
That solo!! Woo!
Classic Peppers! What could be probably better? Tmumbs up, Gentlemen! Huge, Huge Respect! 🙂
Viva el rock por siempre 🎸🤘✌️💪💯🌶️
Te espere mucho  ojala john supiese todo lo que hizo por mi
I miss the stratocaster with that relic.
Awebo, triunfó el mal
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ameeee💛
FRUSCIANTE IS BACK
Su energía está intacta
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
They're back?
Oh shit its john is back hahaha yes !!
Pensar que estuve a nada de conocerlos en Argentina... Maldito covid
Sounds like what would have followed Stadium Arcadium if John had stuck around.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
EU AMO TANTO ESSA BANDA PQP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wow it give me chills
Los RHCP son Pura Vida! :)
Oh john te extrañé 🖤
AWEBOOOOOOO!!!!!
Grande los Chili Pappers. 🌶️❤️🔥
❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tha’s good!
Amazing, welcome back  They currently have 24k likes with only 20k views. Sounds about right!

Rhcp is a band I will always have a soft spot for
Truthful analysis.  Frusciante is my favourite musician ever.  I’ve been waiting for this song for 2,5 years and happy to finally have this.  However, beyond the 9/10 solo it’s weak and I pray this is not reflective of the full album. I have faith.
Thanks!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WELCOME BACK JOHN❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭✨✨✨
ok I think I will listen to this again
待ってたぜアニキ達
Welcome back to John

다시 반가워 프루시안테!  앤소니는 몸이 더 좋아졌네 ㅋㅋ
Wow! Son de esas pocas bandas que apenas recorre varios segundos de la canción y reconoces que son ELLOS. Grandes!! No aguanto poder verlos en el verano! 👏👏👏👏 todas la etapas de mi vida se ven reflejadas al escuchar sus canciones! Larga vida a los red hots!

Momento histórico. A volta!  🇧🇷
Muito emocionante poder ver esses caras juntos de novo. É uma quimica, sintonia que poucas bandas tiveram a oportunidade de ter por tanto tempo(inclusive quando não estavam juntos). Fui a 3 shows do RHCP mas nenhum com o Frusciante! Ansioso para esse momento chegar no meu país RJ! 🇧🇷
Que lindo es tener la oportunidad de ver esto, años esperando a que John vuelva a los red hot, pensado que temas habrian quedado pendientes desde años atrás.Y finalmente se dio, hoy están acá...disfrutemos esto, son momentos únicos en nuestras vidas!🥰😍
Finally!
O Anthony de Mullet Hair é a minha nova religião <33
This is clearly about Covid-19
Anthony mamadisimo a sus casi 60 años, idoloo
Long have I waited.....
Viejos sabrosos
RHCP is back.  John Frusciante will restore order to the world.

This is the highest level of perfection of musical harmonies and sensual vocals.  As if you hear something new, but has long been loved and valuable to you.
Los amo !!! GRACIAS POR TANTOOO
I've been growing up with their albums Californication, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium. I don't know but after all those years... I feel like THOSE tunes will come  back. Thank you John for rejoining 🖤❤💯🌶

Todas las palabras posibles para expresar mi agradecimiento se resumen en:  Gracias infinitas ❤️🌶️
正に私の青春の音だ。また青春を始めよう
I never thought I'd hear Frusciante and Kiedis vocal harmonies again 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Ya no menciona california 😓
OS MELHORES ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I'm witnessing Frusciante's return on my daughter's birthday. Holy shit how the world changes
I have no words to express how amazing it is to see this chili peppers lineup again, it's been 16 years waiting for this moment.
Linda manera de arrancar el año!! Hay esperanza aún, claro que sí 🙌🙌
Velhooooooo, não acredito que tô vendo o John de volta!!
No lo puedo creer!! Despues de esperar tanto 😍🇦🇷
This has such stadium arcadium vibes and I love it!! John’s backing vocals are spot on, Anthony sounds amazing, flea’s bass playing great as always, and chads drumming always rock solid. RHCP is back♥️
Red hot chili love❤️
Best way to wake up for work…. New chilli Peppers music 😍
cara, que retorno, single puramente red hot no ápice.  início lindo e refrão numa vibe única deles, solo insano depois do primeiro refrão, singularidade foda do Anthony nas vocais, baixo do Flea indispensável e Frusciante continua inconfundível e excepcional pra completar.
por ustedes les hecho ganas a la escuela
Love you guys!!! So fucking excited for this
THEY'RE BACK
IM SO EXCITED
Ni que decir, 6 largos años 6 LARGOS AÑOS los espere tanto los extrañe tanto no saben cuanto amo que hayan regresado encerio 😭 fueron mi mas grande admiracion desde los 5 años, cada album cada rola me la se de memoria, son y siempre seran mi banda favorita, gracias John por haber traido de regreso los solos tan magnificos que te cargas, el gran bajo del maestro Flea, la gran rapides de la bateria de Chad y como siempre, la voz tan original del Anthony, los amo a los 4 😭❤🤘larga vida a RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 😭❤
Gracias muchachos, esto es un respiro de vida. Un deleite al oído escucharlos de nuevo a los 4, estoy demasiado emocionado y feliz. Bendiciones desde Colombia 🇨🇴
Thank you for your song make emotion for movement on my way. Love you red hot chili peppers band.

Gracias por existir como personas y como banda.
Derkside of the moon-Kiedis
Seeing the old gang back together... brings back memories 😁😎🤘 FUCK YEA!!!
Rhcp por siempre ♥️🎸
Wow! I'm really impressed... I'm not considering myself as a huge fan of this band (though I love some of their songs), but this one left me really impressed. In the times of really shitty music, this one sounds like something special.
🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴 Amor eterno :v
You're the light of my life
That makes me so happy
Aiii meu ❤. Ameiii e já quero as outras 16 músicas logooo, como eu amo essa banda cara, desde lá dos anos 90, tava muito ansiosa por esse novo álbum!!🥰🌶 Anthony continua um gostosoooooo mas oq ele fez nesse cabelo? Kkkkk🤣🤣

Que sdds que eu tava dessa banda 😍
Anthony tiene el corte más viral del tito 🤑🤙
The solo is awesome
Los Red Hot Chili Peppers es la mejor banda del mundo. La increíble pegada de Chad Smith, el bajo de la reputa madre de Flea, la guitarra virtuosa de Frusciante y la inigualable voz de Anthony Kiedis. Mézclalos y obtienes otra joya de álbum. Ya quiero escuchar completo Unlimited Love.
después de tanto tiempo😭
I wouldn't have recognized this is a new song from them
Uffff👌❤
What a quality song, I’ve had it on repeat now for ages. Californication vibes 💜
Умерла от счастья) Всем спасибо!

I love you guys so much
Woooooowwww Im so excited

Beautiful!!! Welcome back RHCP! 💙
NO WAY
I love RHCP. Love from Indonesia 🇲🇨
Mr. Frusciante is back🥺
No tengo palabras para explicar lo que su música significa en mi vida. Los amo. Estoy emocionada
why is his voice so weirdly autotuned? it sounds legit irish sea shanty at times
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Uhuuuuiu 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's been a long time since I've heard John's influence on the chili peppers and may I say the wait was worth it, can't wait to listen to the crazy guitar riffs and solos the new album has to offer us earthlings. Long live the chili peppers. Love from Ecuador.
They didnt change. Maintaining their authentic Rhcp vibes forever. 🔥🔥🔥😎❤️
This John Frusciante guy is good. I hope he sticks around.
レッチリついに再始動か ジョシュも恋しいしジョンのサウンドも良い
tkm Red Hot Chili Peppers 🇵🇪
The Frusciante Effect...incomparables groove meister...
Mis amores de vuelta😍
so weird, so RHCP, I love it!!
Bienvenido a casa, John!!
I am so happy! I love it!
Senti falta de um "California" na música. Brincadeira, música tá perfeita, é bom ver esses caras juntos depois de tanto tempo ❤
Comecei a escutar profundamente RHCP em meados de 2019, e desde então se tornou minha maior influência musicalmente. O impressionante é q eu conheci rhcp na era Josh e mesmo assim, à volta do John está sendo algo impactante em mim, provavelmente devido do seu grande peso e importância na história da banda.  Muito feliz com sua volta!!!
I've been needing you guys for a while now; life's been tough. Thank you so much for coming back!
Is this real life??? 🤩🤩🤩🤩
John is back, and it’s awesome!!!!
Frusciante stole the show!
Wow you guys have lost nothing! This song is awesome! I've been so hyped for this album!
🤘😎🤘🥸🤘🧐
imagine to live concert
Anthony ma boi
Как в старые добрые, такая ностальгия, как будто в 90-е вернулся
The strat is back!!!! 🤟🤟🤟
How is there more likes than views
Eu amo demais 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Gracias a la vida por poder presenciar esto de nuevo!!

Aaaaaaaaaaah ❤🌶🥰
Hello again John!
i dont dig it. i would listen to it but not intentionally
John is welcomed back the guitar sticks out but flea and chad are still there so it’s a bop in my eyes
Here we go again johnnnnnn😍
Thank you RHCP!love you guys!! Cheers
Wow he had his t-shirt on for whole minute and a half
Loved!!! 🤘🏼👏🏽👏🏽🤘🏼
Amazing Classic chorus and guitar solos by john,Welcome Back
Everything about the chili peppers is brilliant. Since their inception, it's almost as if they've summoned every incarnation through this song. A somber sad feel that's somehow still comforting and warming. I love the call backs to other music videos in this as well, coming together like californication, Anthony running in under the bridge, etc. This video felt like a welcome back of long time friends. Their energy and youth is unmatched, that is their quixoticelixcer. There is no secret, just the power and love of music🤘🏽
John rocks so happy he is back
John Wick did some dope solo here🔥
JOHN IS BACK!
Posting my coment to remember i was here at this moment
Tan excitante ver de nuevo a Frusciante tocar esa majestuosa guitarra.
Good
It’s finally here!!
The meme was real. Anthony has become the by the way taxist
Yeeeeeeeessss! They are back!!
You didn't mention California:(
estupefied.
Joder e llorado de emocion
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
We've been waiting, we've been waiting a long time to see this!!
What an amazing band  !!

Frusciante ❤️

deus abençoe
Congrats to all us chilli peppers fans who have been waiting for this day since December 2019 when they announced John was back. We endured thru numerous cancellations & setbacks because of Covid but we are here. BLACK SUMMER HAS ENDED 🤘🏾
Thank GOSH music is BAAAAACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!! Welcome back John!!!!!!!!!!!! We MISSED you!!!!!!!!
#BLACKSUMMER
Hell ya, I got tickets to see them in Chicago. Can't wait!!!
Increible verlos juntos de nuevo😭😭❤
I want lost in this sky
The best, forever!
Nunca pensé verlos volver. Y hoy, después de tanto tiempo, una inmensidad de obras y canciones de la mejor calidad, ellos finalmente vuelven. Aquellos astros artísticos encargados de hacernos viajar con su música a lugares impensables. Los mismos que me levantaron y motivaron a seguir cuando no hallaba aliento. Simplemente son un claro ejemplo de lucha contra sus propios demonios y de éxito al mismo tiempo. Esos son los Pepper´s! Su música vivirá por generaciones.
Increíble volvió John ♥️♥️♥️
made my year
I know you guys since 1998 and your songs still give me goosebumps. Love you ❤️
So it begins! Another era is now born, mofos. Fucking yeah
Finally! 6 years of waiting was worth it. Long live to Red Hot Chilli Peppers🌶🎸!!  Greetings from Peru 🇵🇪🤘
Frusciante Is lendary
I love these guys so much
The wait is over.
John is back gentlemen ✨💕
Its not great but im happy it still sounds like RHCP its kinda painful to really see how old the musicians i grew up on are getting but im just glad the sounds haven’t changed  Rock on RHCP
Wooooou what a surprise 🔥
Really like the chorus! Anthony’s Irish sailor croon is really funny and cool too. Totally dig the song! Can’t wait for the whole record, bands firing on all cylinders! 🤟
Pre-order has started and will be released on 4-1-22
It's SO GOOD to hear John back, dude- that psychedelic solo got me tearing up.
👏🙌🙌awebo que chido regreso
Volvieron! No dejan de sorprender, estos 4 si que son mágicos! Gracias 🥲
I didn't know it, but his is why I stayed up.
❤️Love it! The sound is soooo right on. Thank you, guys. ❤️
Pooooha que voltaram com tudo 😍😍😍😍
♥️
When John launched into his first solo I was really overcome with emotion. We haven’t heard that sound since 2008. The sound of John playing his guitar with so much conviction intensity and beauty, backed up by Chad and Flea. It really sent me on a trip.. Pumped for the new album!
The Guitar God is back and this vibe is absolutely phenomenal
Fuck yeahhhh!!!
🔥🌶️🔥🌶️
Increíble ver de nuevo a John Frusciante en los RHCP ❤️ La mejor banda del mundo😭
This song is going to be SICK AS FUCK when they play it live - their tour this year with John is gonna be legendary!! 🤘🤘🤘
caralho, é incrível ter a oportunidade de poder ver a banda em sua formação original fazendo músicas novas e turnês pelo mundo de novo, espero demais vê-los ao vivo num futuro próximo, apenas aprecie enquanto dure.
Chorei e não foi pouco, simplesmente não estou acreditando, é real ♥️♥️♥️
WTF, to think it popped up in my feed. 44 minutes ago

I was in need of this so much
Que belleza de canción y de solo 😍
Música nova? É isso mesmo??? ❤️

Definitivamente es el mejor momento para ser fan de los RHCP ❤️
I’m crying🥺

State of keidis!! Haha he looks like something from one of them victorian freak shows, they shouldn't have bothered, they just look like a load of geriatrics that have escaped from a care home
Vengan a Perú 🇵🇪 🇵🇪 🇵🇪 🇵🇪 🇵🇪
This song make my day. Glad i open youtube and find out this amazing song.
🖤🖤🖤
Who's sailin on the censor ship 👩‍🌾
Me parte el alma saber que no podre ir a un concierto de estos señores, Dioos al menos me has permitido poder escucharlos!
👀👍🏿
Welcome back boys. 🤘🍻❤
John frusciante, ficou perfeito, sem ele a banda não é a mesma .. 🥰🥰
Get to England I carnt wait 3 months
😍😍😍
oh my GOD
Fiquei feliz quando anunciaram a volta do Jhon. Sou da época do Californication, um dos primeiros cds de rock que comprei e tals, clipes do cd passando a exaustão na tv. Mas depois disso passei a não gostar tanto do som da banda, parece que enveredou para um sonzinho mais pop bobinho. Já no último a sonoridade de Dark Necessities me agradou mais. Agora nessa nova, nas primeiras impressões, achei comum, não me pareceu que vai impactar muito se for o single de estreia mesmo. Mas é isso, estou feliz pela banda estar na ativa ainda. Quem sabe na próxima vinda ao Brasil, possa ver eles.
Cara, todas as cores do clip me lembraram muito The Zephyr Song, na época eu tinha apenas 8 anos quando conheci aquela obra prima no clip mania que passava na Band, 20 anos depois eu estou sentindo a mesma felicidade que sentia na época quando via esses caras tocarem, ainda vou a um show! Vida longa ao RHCP.  Frusciante lendário! ❤️
Hoooo en un momento fue tan bueno el climax que se me erizo la piel🔥❤️🥴😎🤯🤯
Welcome back boys. 🤘🍻❤
Am I first? First
POR FIN!!!.
this is the medicine for my longing 🔥
Welcome Mr. Frusciante.
aguardando ansiosamente pelo novo álbum. Viva RHCP!!
🇦🇷 RHCP 🇦🇷
I cannot wait to hear this whole album!!! Love my boys!!!!!
Solo sounds like Frusciantes solo from "unreachable" on his album empyrean. Anyone else hear the similar sounds?
Espere tanto para esta tremenda porquería?, regresenme a mi Josh
Por fin!!!!!!
Perfect timing!! I was feeling this one right before i got here. I love this band so much. From the Southwest Sunset Skies.
Tan guapos como siempre
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another day, Another hit
Black Summer Lyrics  A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
<3
can't wait to see you guys at the end of the year. one more thing off my bucket list. <33333
John is back 😩
AL FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
just one word : AMAZING !!!!!
I’m so elated

Mejoraron mi dia completamente, que los rhcp sean eternos🥶🥶❤
Frusciante s back!!!! 🤘
I can't figure out the accent Anthony is trying to use here
Ahhhhh😍 ADIÓS DEPRESIÓN!
🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪
This makes me so happy. This band has meant so much to me throughout my life. Welcome back John! I dearly thank you Chad, Flea, Anthony and John for this beautiful gift. Just ordered the limited edition vinyl!
The outro guitar feels like warpaint at some points
VIVISSIMOOOOOOOS! ❤
Though I’m a young fan it’s nice to hear them still rocking ‘til now!! I hope they also release a cassette copy for this
I LOVE YOU GUYS! T_T
Yo los vi en vivo en 2002 y en 2007 aqui en México pero esta nueva canción  suena muy mal, horrible diria yo, repetitiva, formulaica y sin ningún tipo de textura. Deberian retirarse ya aunque entiendo que al Sr. Frusciante le hace falta dinero después del divorcio que casi lo deja en bancarrota.
So Much Love In This Band ❤️❤️💫
Que lindo es que tu novia te llame a las 2 am para despertarte con esta noticia! Nuevo tema de la mejor banda 🥰 los amoo!!!!!que emoción!
The best band in the world is back!
Son las 2:41 AM Este temazo se estrenó hace 41 minutos Tiene 18 k visitas Me siento raro, busqué Los Red Hots para escuchar un poco de la buena Y me apareció este tema en primera posición  Está lloviendo y es una noche hermosa, aunque llena de mosquitos Temazo...
great amazing
👍🤘
i´m so damn happy right now, thats it
Finally :O
Grandes!!!! 😎
El regreso de John Dios Frusciante🥺💣❤
ainda tô sem acreditar nisso tudo 🤯 frusciante de volta a banda e um álbum novo e duplo estilo stadium arcadium !!!!!! é uma ótima época pra ser fã de red hot chili peppers, esse momento é histórico e eu agradeço muito por estar vendo tudo isso acontecer!❤️❤️❤️

Está pequeña parte de mi vida, se llama felicidad, gracias por toda esta música tan hermosa muchachos, esperando que puedan venir a Perú
Here before it reaches 1million views!! 👌👌
Temazo wn! 🇨🇱 que alegría Chile Peppers 🇨🇱
I haven't really heard a RHCP song that's been released within the last 15 years, what the hell are those vocals? Good song but those vocals are throwing me off
the fact these guys are together and still putting out new music is more than anything I’d want at this point  oh my fucking god  i’m gonna cry 😭😭🖤🖤🖤
Amo vocês 😍😍😍😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
this song gave me very stadium arcadium vibes
Bout fuckin time!!!
😁I've never been so excited!😁                      ❤️🔥🌶️
Larga vida a los chili peppers ❤️🌶️
Is like a mix between stadium arcadium and i'm beside you
The rhythm took me right at the first note, this song is very very good
i guess we are back to the boring hendrix-esque chili peppers with nothing funky or punkish about their sound lol but hey it was a good run i guess lmao
Nos acompañaron en cada etapa de nuestras vidas con cada canción y nos marcaron a fuego para siempre! Larga vida a los red hot!!! ❤️
Thank you for uploading. I'm happy to hear RHCP's new songs in this era.
This band is aging like a fine wine
Viejos sabrosos 🌶🔥🌶🔥🌶
They still got it
ver a Flea bien loco y teniendo el control total del bajo, a Chad como mantiene el ritmo de una manera tan putamente magistral, a Jhon jalar esas cuerdas como un puto maestro y a Anthony verlo cantar y bailar tan chingon como en los viejos tiempos me hizo brotar muchas lagrimas de alegria. Han vuelto estos cabrones y espero el puto album con todas mis ganas
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
So happy to see this. It’s makes me cry.. amazing song and so glad that John is back🥰❤️
Red Hot Chili Peppers, vai com calma, tem crianças chorando aqui! QUE MÚSICA É ESSA??? Só quem é fã sabe o quanto esse momento está sendo mágico! Música linda, sintonia do grupo perfeito! Enfim, a melhor banda do mundo!
Bellísimo ❤️ qué hermoso verlos y escucharlos. Saludos desde Argentina
wa🤩

Larga vida red hot chili peppers ❤️
Fuck yeah! I literally have goosebumps! The chili peppers are whole again! Listen to those fucking Frusciante riffs and tone!
Came out half an hour ago and I already know all the lyrics 🤣
Increible ,buen ritmo RHCP genios
Caras, não dá nem pra explicar o que vocês significam pra mim e o quão foda tem sido estar com vocês nessa viagem maluca que é a vida por todos esses anos!
I am bawling like a baby rn… been a fan since I was 7 years old (2006) and never thought I’d see the day that John came back… I can’t believe I have the privilege of seeing them live I am going to fucking transcend this plane of existence
This https://youtu.be/y1I4eFgXMbw
OMG ES HERMOSOOOO DESPUÉS DE TANTOS AÑOS SIN ESCUCHAR MÚSICA NUEVA DE USTEDES 4 JUNTOS, VALIÓ LA PENA CADA SEGUNDO❤️🇲🇽
Los amo lpm, por más que no vengan este año a argentina los adoro con el alma, frusciante es un dios en lo que a guitarra se fe refierre, ¿no les causa un cosquilleo en el cuello cada uno de sus solos de guitarra? Sin más. Saludos desde Argentina leyendas 🇦🇷♥
Its aight
0:48 " a esa parte de mi, a esa parte de mi le llamo felicidad" 😭😭😭
*camera focus on the fender* me: screams
:'v
❤️ Waiting for this!
John's guitar parts are good, classic tone... Fuzz, klon, jet phaser, and a doubling of the parts to fatten it up... Maybe a stereo chorus split and a vibe at some points. I have to grab my board and break it down tomorrow. I'm a little thrown by the medieval vocal parts though. Only time will tell if someone claims, *"I've been waiting.. I've been waiting!"*
This song is growing on me….A lot. Even if this album is just okay, I am beyond thankful to hear new music from them with John Frusciante….and see them live later this year. Never had the chance to see them live with John. It’s all about the experience and having something that feels familiar during these incredibly dark times.
UhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuLL!! HAHA!!!! ❤🤘🔥🤯
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Los amo ❤
Finally after 6 years ❤️
35mins ago wow
I was scared that maybe the reason I loved their past music so much was because of nostalgia and thus the new album wouldn't be as great... glad I was wrong :)
I missed you taking your shirt off!!❤❤👋such an amazing guitar solo
Siempre RHCP 💓
I felt as if my heart was jumping during that amazing solo. Thanks John for coming back, I love you.
Did Frusciante have some work down on his face or eyes? Apologies if this has been asked and answered..
I think it's okay
eu amo vocês !!!!!!
starting my day well!!!!
É OFICIAL, JOHN ESTÁ DE VOLTA!!!! ESSE NOVO ÁLBUM SERÁ INCRÍVEL!!! ♥️
AGUANTEN LOS RED HOT!!!!!
Been out for 30 minutes already 17k views... I'm so ready for the album!! That solo was tasty as hell and I just want to hear some more shreddage!!!!
Volvieron los RHCP 👹🔥📸
THEY'RE BACK

Que som phoda, que vibe indescritível em ouvir essa obra! A maior banda do mundo tá de volta! Salve John Frusciante, salve RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! 🙏🏻🔥
Aaaaahh los amo infinitamente
Fru is back 😁 👍 💪 RHCP is back 😁.  0:47  Jimi H. ghost 🎸 is back👏😁
This week I listened to Stadium Arcadium on repeat (in my opinion still the best album they ever made) and I just had the feeling that a new song is coming. Woke up today and checked on spotify... Listening to this banger track on repeat :D
Gives me chills hearing them together. 🥰 waiting 16 years to hear them together again and would have waited a lifetime. Amazing 👏
Grandes chili peppers :333
THE FUCKING SOUND MY LIFE NEEDED, FOREVER RED HOT BABYS !!!
❤️
la john frusciante especial vieja, que linda guitarra

I can't believe that John is with us... I feel like I'm dreaming, but I'm not. Thanks guys
Here is Johnny.🙌🙌 👇This is how you miss him.
time is passing for all of us... but not for this guys! they`re still fresh and powerful as the first day! Oh yeah!!!  Excellent!  I remember myself singing "under the bridge" in a melancholic way, back in my teen days, bak inthe 90's... now 30 years later I'm happy seeing this.   Thank you guys for exist and be all yourself all this years. ...and still be unique.  greetings from Colombia!
Gracias Red Hot, siempre le dan más vida a mí cuerpo, vuelvan a Colombia
No pierden la esencia, son los mejores, su disco the greatest hits del 2003, fue mi cd favorito durante la secundaria. 🇲🇽

Un locura ver a John de nuevo en la banda mi banda favorita 🇻🇪
Amazing, I remember I was a kid in school buying their album mothers milk and they're still making music.
I knew it was the right time to get a mullet.
He esperado tanto este momento... y puedo decir que valió la pena cada segundo! Por favor sean eternos 😍 son los mejores!!!  No saben la emoción que siento ptm!!!!  Saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪 por favor vengan por aquiiii!!! Solo tardé 30 min en comentar pero estuve viendo el video una y otra vez 🤪 son geniales!
Let’s go!!! From my hometown!!!!
:)
Got heavy into RHCP finding out they sang so many songs i grew up hearing on the radio. But by the time i got into them around 2010-2011 john had already left the band  I still got excited about “im with you” and there were good songs on that album but as one critic put it “theres a frusciante shaped hole in their sound” and “the getaway” was good too ..”better than im with you” in my opinion So finally im getting an album from the band that i grew up hearing
THIS IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!!!!
глазам не верю
Great to see Will Ferrell getting behind the drums again♥️
LFG
Les extrañamos por mucho tiempo, bastante tiempo...    🇬🇹❤
Amazing
Gran retorno de los ídolos de siempre.
Anyone else hear the weird accent from Anthony? It sounds Irish or Scottish.
Will Ferrell is still killing those drums!!!!!
Dam gura and Cali dropped a new song now rhcp best birthday ever
remember day.
que momento para estar vivo
MASTERPIECE
This sounds like real RHCP. John is RHCP
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back and they here to save 2022! ❤️  Been waiting so long. Here from India 🇮🇳. Where are you from? 🤩
Love it!! But then again I love anything these gentlemen put out. Especially if John is back in the band! John is so handsome and talented. Please John never leave again, it isn't the same without you.

Perfection it’s this, nothing else ❤️🌶
Frusciante is back ! Frissons motherfuckeeeeeer !!!
Instantly you know it’s John back on guitar, then he confirms it with his backing vocals then nails it with a classic Frusciante solo. RHCP are back!

Exactly what the world needs now. Obsessed 🤩

Tanks rhcp... Tanks ♥️
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply  The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew  (Get it on)  My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end  I've been waiting I've been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Just Fantastic! Great expectatives to the next album 🇪🇨🔴

Jhooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon <3
will never get old
WELCOME JOHNNNNNNNNNNNN🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
I got near front row tickets to a concert in Toronto CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE WITH FRUSCIANTE!!!
frusciante and the guys are back finally
Bravoo!
After the darkness comes the light!  I always believed that John would come back to the band. 2019 was a VERY HARD year for me and at the end of the year i was really depressed, so when the announcement of his return came that was a real uplift for me at the time. Then in 2020 COVID came and it were 2 very dark years for humanity. Now here we are and it seems that this black summer is ending! I am so glad to witness this moment!
Feels like this song is about the joy of John coming back. They’ve been waiting for another black summer to end.
John  Frusciante sound so good .
Temazo👌👌👌👌
Great!
Legendaria banda que nunca envejece ♡
Ребята, я так ждал!!! Великолепно!
simplesmente red hot 😍
Al fin. Llegaron a poner orden a la música de hoy en día 👏🏼 🇵🇪
JOHN FRUSCIANTE ❤️

Once again I feel alive.
Los amo chili fletes😍😍

OMG terrible 🤮
Топ
Three extremely talented musicians there for sure. SO much love for John Frusciante.  It pains me to see his beautiful contributions run through the filter of Anthony Kiedis. That was hard to watch.
kinda odd seein a member of the AARP in skinny jeans but otherwise it was interesting
Amazing visuals, beatiful color grading 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
Thank U RHCP
Will Ferrell is good at drums
Que hermoso, nunca espere volver a verlos juntos, valió la pena esperar todos estos años
Stadium Arcadium 2.0. Not that thats a bad thing. But this song would fit right in.
❤️💫🎸 everything is gonna be alright now! The energy is back! Thank you! 😘
Thanks for this 😁 love u Frusciante
That solo killed me x.x
Volvieron para demostrar que siempre van a ser los mejores y que no perdieron su pizca, nana, épico.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Uhuuul, salve do Brasil
I was NOT expecting this today, holy shit
RHCP! 🇲🇽

Una de mis bandas favoritas regresa después de varios años 🤟🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥
John frusciante and his 1962 stratocaster greeting me like an old friend
We owe them A LOT. Rock music owe them MUCH MORE
the songs great but why does Anthony have the accent?… it sounds wrong
Perfect for the weekend!! Thx RHCP! <3
Frusciante's tone is just perfect.  Love that fuzzy guitar.  Everyone's on point.  And Anthony is singing with some weird accent?  Haha.  Love it!  They're back!  🤘
Después de enterarme que John volvía en Diciembre de 2019 y que en 2020 se metían en el estudio a pesar de la pandemia y después de mucho esperar por fin un adelanto de lo que se viene el 1 de Abril cuándo se lance el nuevo disco, es una maravilla escuchar este sencillo y ver este video de los 4 juntos. Deseando verles en Sevilla el 7 de Junio.
JUE MADRES!!!! 👏👏👏
Greatest band in the world

2022!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Thanks for bringing John back, thanks for the new songs. I've seen you guys live twice, but I'm definitely going to see you again, now with Frusciante. That's a dream I thought I would never fulfill. COME TO BRAZIL ❤️🇧🇷
Los mejores, siempre.
Cuando tenía como 6 años recuerdo haber visto el video de Californication por primera vez, en una pequeña televisión en MTV, nunca había escuchado algo mejor.  14 años después, me sigue estremeciendo su música como el primer día. Gracias, en serio gracias por ser los mejores y por su música tan maravillosa!
TEMAZO
This feels like when for the first time I heard Around the world in 1998.... Feels like it, a strong first single followed by some of their best songs ever...
Yayyy!
Voy a ver este video las veces que sean necesarias para guadarme este retorno, Frusciante que emoción, piel de gallina verlo. Verlos nuevamente juntos, esa magia, esas sonrisas.
BRUTAAAAAAAAL
muito bom parabéns 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Temazo, me recuerda mucho al stadium arcadium!

Que felicidad!!!!!
LOS AMO CARAJO GRACIAS POR SALVAR MI VIDA
It's funny how was I missing you guys earlier today and yet here we are!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just listened through it 3 straight times and I love it more each time. Feels like they picked up right where Stadium left off, I dig it. Sooo happy to hear John's sweet stylings back in the mix.
Groovy tune. Sounds like Frusciante’s been listening to Hendrix circa 1970. Never a bad thing. Glad that he’s back in the fold.
Finally a Rock Album to Rock global stage and give a chance to kids to live beyond garbage bands like BTS
No tiene sentido que con la edad que tienen se vean tan jovenes al igual que su musica.
❤️🔥🌶️ Gods!
Tanto tiempo esperando volver a verlos juntos y aquí están. No se puede con tanta emoción 😭❤
Iconic.
siiiiiiiiiiii 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Por fin!!!  Se lo ve tan feliz a John. Maravilloso!
son increíbles, no hay palabras🇦🇷
18 years back a good friend of mine gave me a purple CD with a childish written name on it “RHCP” it was the Californication album and my introduction to rock music! Today I think I felt this feeling again! Thank you RHCP you’re definitely one of the legends of music! 🙏🏻
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
It's notorious how John's back since this could have perfectly matched in By the Way
Welcome back dear Fruscianteeeee!
Ferrel on the kit!

See you all in Denver and Chicago this summer of unlimited love
Till the end.
It has been a couple of "Black Summer" for many people around the world, would definitely like to know the story behind the single, so sad the tour isn't going to pass through Puerto Rico, nonetheless best wishes for the whole team and respective families, God bless RHCP 🔴🔥🌶

los amo son perfectos!! :C
Conheci o Red Hot na MTV vendo o clipe Scar Tissue. Foi amor a primeira vista! Aprendi a tocar Guitarra com 15 anos de idade por influência do John. Hoje com 31 anos sou guitarrista e meu coração 💓 aquece de ver meu maior ídolo musical retornando para a minha banda favorita.
SOS grande red hot, como si fuera ayer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow ... I cant wait to see you in Florence next June !!
RED HOT PORRAAAA
Outstanding. Welcome back boys!
So good to hear that smooth backing vocal again!!! Can't wait for the new album 🤟

They are my favorite band ever but I was expecting a bit more since John's back, sounds a bit generic and the video is a bit weird. Anyway I'm excited for the album.

A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now) Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end

An Irish sea shanty
Obra de arte🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Love it and looking forward to the new album but at 3.34 Chad hits his cymbals in the video but in the audio it doesn’t sound. Bad video editing obviously. Just wish artist would pay more attention to their videos and what’s going on with the sound at the same time. 🙄
New old favorite thing. So happy right now!
It's so strange, in a good way, seeing a mildly jacked kiedis lol and man oh man, you can't help but love frusciantes guitar. Legends. Absolute legends. Respect.
RHCPに感謝!! ジョンおかえりなさい!!
AAAAAAHHHHHHH LOS RED HOTTTTTSSS!!!😍😍😍 Se les extrañaba😢 Fruscianteeeee❤❤❤
like from Ukraine !!!
Words absolutely cannot describe how much my life needs this right now how long I’ve been waiting for these four to be back together
La esencia sigue intacta bolo!

No es por despreciar a Josh, pero como te extrañamos Jhon, el sonido de los peppers se complementa mejor con John!!! Espero con ansias ese disco!!! 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
I love so much Red Hot Chili Peppers! 🌶️❤️

Es como escuchar algo viejo pero nuevo. Suena a clásico.
Revivió la música, revivio la lírica, regocija el pentagrama, sonríe la melodía, sonríen los instrumentos, recusitó la composición
I’m CRYING! RHCP ARE BACK❤️❤️❤️
🥃💪👍🎸
Its a Wonderful ❤
We finally have some good music again....it's been a long time coming
We waited patiently and they fucking delivered. So grateful to the RHCP crew!!
2:38 MANDOU O GABIGOL MANÉ
Los extrañaba muchachos 🤩
Espere tantos años por esto...
Perfect comeback!!
i expected a lot, but this actually surpassed my expectations. that sound on the guitar solo, that break and then going back to the ref, the clean sound of the guitar during the picking part, that funky sound when playing the chords. i could cry
FUCK YEAH RHCP
❤❤❤❤
Porfin lo nuevo de rhcp
How incredible that this band continues to reach the deepest heart 🇵🇪❤️
El momento más esperado por toda latinoamérica unida
Llore  escuchándolos de nuevo ❤

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FLEA CON PONCHO AAHDJWJ
gracias muchachos
Hermosa song
Dazzling! I really hope a tour in Latinoamerica! 😊
Tsss Jhon back! Siempre se escuchan tan bien estos carnalitos. Seguro están en uno de sus mejores momentos, se ve y se siente. Suena cómo un poco de varios de sus hits, cuando está frusciante en unas escenas, quizá una remembranza a "under the bridge" 👏👏👏
Los dioses han vueltos!!!
Aaaaaaaaaa por fin viva🌶🌶🌶
RHCP IS BACK LEZZ GOOOOOO
🔥🔥🔥
insano
The autotune is strong in this one. It could be a stylistic choice for this one song, but I hope they ditch the autotune for the rest of the album and rock on like they always have!
QUE FUCKING EPICO!!!! HAN VUELTOOOOO!!!!!!
SON LOS NÚMERO 1🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽❤❤❤❤❤❤
Que música divertida ♡
LETS GO! TRULY HISTORICAL! 🌶🌶🌶

THEY'RE BACK!
Conheci o RHCP em 1992 (sim, sei que é de 91, mas conheci em 92), quando ouvi Under the Bridge aqui no Brasil. Eu tinha 11 anos e nunca mais parei. São 30 anos com esses caras!!!
LETS GOOOOO
estas tan bello como el día que te fuiste Jhon uwu
A lazy rain am I The skies refuse to cry Cremation takes its piece of your supply The night is dressed like noon A sailor spoke too soon And China's on the dark side of the moon  (Hit me now)  Platypus are a few The secret life of roo A personality I never knew (Get it on) My Greta weighs a ton The archers on the run And no one stands alone behind the sun  It's been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  Crack the flaming whip Sailing on a censorship Riding on a headless horse to make the trip  Been a long time since I made a new friend Waiting on another black summer to end It's been a long time and you never know when Waiting on another black summer to end  I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end I been waiting I been waiting Waiting on another black summer to end
Conservaron su esencia y no como otras bandas q cambiaron las guitarras por tons
Fuck yes Frusciante!

Amazing!!! AQP
TEMAZO DIOS AAAAAAA

Uma gota limpa e cristalina nesse oceano podre e imundo que se tornou a música mundial. Pobreza musical, pobreza cultural e espiritual  é o que vivemos hoje. Obrigado Red Hot por ainda estarem conosco.

Os anos passam e o RHCP não perde sua essência. É difícil de acreditar, mas em pleno 2022 , um clipe novo de uma banda que marca gerações, é surreal!!
vou chorar, que perfeição, to muito feliz por estar vivo e ouvindo isso
Si no me equivoco, esta canción está dirigida al padre de Anthony, Blackie Kiedis, quien falleció y fue cremado el año pasado.. de ahí viene el nombre "Black Summer"
Josh died for this.
A great day to be alive, thanks to the RHCP for this gift to be enjoyed for the rest Of My time in this planet.
AM I DREAMING???JF IS BACK AND THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME
Ficar acordado até as 2h da manhã compensou
BEM VINDO DE VOLTA FRUSCIANTE. VAI CARAI!!!!!!!!!!
