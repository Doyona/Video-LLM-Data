Ever met any real ones from the actual Russian Federation?
3 days later:
Learn about Donbas...
I’m Russian and i can confirm. This is 100% accurate
There’s a spot here at my table. You’re more than welcome to eat with us Canadiens.  (So long as you don’t slash any of us… THEN ITS ON)
Ukraine? can I sleep in your room tonight?
lmfaoo
Пхпхпхпхпххвахахахахвх
I find it interesting that Americans seem to think generally that Russia has brought upon itself worldwide condemnation for attempting to occupy Ukraine. When in reality, it's strengthening ties to a significant portion of the world. China, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and some parts of Africa are very accepting of Russia's actions. Additionally, the US is profiting off of the war, regardless of who the politicians claim to condemn, it still sells military technology to whoever is willing to pay for it.
Jajaja Vlad Putin can and will sit down in the very same place Sleepy Frauden does.
XD
Quality dipped a lot
I don't watch the olympic therefore I not understand reference, but I will take another person's comment and use theirs instead.
Nikolai Russanov just wanted to make comrades 🥺
Lol the food is Ukrainian colors nice
Booooooo
Is there a seat that america appointed a nazi to control and then when a war breaks out one that they will then put the biggest pussy in the country incharge of all the while pretending were going to let said seat into the UN*
This sounds like Gru from Despicable Me.
"Dope" I mean good? I don't get it
The fact he said "dope" cracked me up
Haha. People are dying
OCCUPY lmao
american olympians at the cafeteria
Gus managed to say invade, and then Russia Invades Ukraine???
The video doesn’t say that is actually a Russian women
Poor man
GG on 700k views
Hey team Belarus, we bought your coach Egor a nice Rolex. And what's good Egor is good for you, no?
3 days later, the war started...  Gus what have you done
best gus skit in a while, thier all gems, but i swear i almost pissed myself.
This same video but with an Israeli
That one didn’t age quite so well
lmao 3 days before the invasion what timing
How did I miss this when it came out. This is so good.
666k views 😳
Lol, gus predicting the future...
In all seriousness i know a lot of Russian are against the attacks, so don't judge just because they are Russian
That Russian sounded, so canadian
Well, this didn't age well
LOL.. just keep coming back to this.. lol
This aged well.
I meen take over the Olympics
I think they want to take over the world 🌎
Oh God. I just looked at the date.
Bro came right out of dispicable me
Aren't they banned from the Olympics?
I love the background joke on the board AND the cereal? bar on the left that has the Ukrainian colors.
This is funny as fuck
He predicted the invasion, I really need to start making my stock picks based on Gus's international politics commentary.
CHEEKI BREEKI
I can only imagine all the ukrainian athletes and athletes from nato countries all givin him the rock eyebrow look
it's accurate too since most Middle Class Russians are apparently extremely polite as opposed to their higher class counterparts
The fact that this was 3 days before the sPeCCiAl MiLITTAARy OpErAtIoN is amazing
Actually Russia is banned from entering the olympics
e
😐😐😐😐😐
drinking
“You miss 100% of the shots you never take!”  Why do I feel that’s an allegory for Putin’s attempt with invading Ukraine 😂
🤣
Poor guy,
"this food looks pretty bomb--uhh"
Just do it and then say you were forced to do so.
Mfw comments are filtered
You're exactly right!! Russia is unlawfully invading a foreign country!! Just like America's war in Iraq or war in Afghanistan, or current wars with Syria, Somalia, or Yemen!!!!!! Why do you think Russia is invading Ukraine?!? Maybe because the United States backed a coup back in 2014?!?
please gus, run for office so we can have someone maybe 2/3rds as cool as Zelensky and then take more acting classes. i love you so i make a really mean joke that i hope you appreciate because you are a real man and not a bitch like 4/9ths of america and almost 90% of all American presidents. also you have no slaves which is huge
poor Russians getting villainised because Putin is pulling some bs
Filter
The only thing I have to say about this is the Gatorade bottle on the tray. There would be Powerade seen as they have a contract with the Olympic committee
Why does Gus's Russian accent sound like how people talk in Fargo
The fact that this was actually just 3 days before the invasion makes the timing of this golden 😂  Slava Ukrayini ✌️
And just like that, *poof* the controversy is gone.
The Russians ran out of gas on the way to the cafeteria
People are dying
The Soviets used to really love forcing famines on Ukraine during the 1930's.....
Guys you can’t blame Putin he was out drinking with the boys
This was made 3 days before Russia began the invasion
this aged well
Why couldn’t he say “dope”?
Hey Gus golf
And 3 days after this was posted.
pretty good. glad to see you posting
God I missed you!
Russians and Americans are two sides of the same coin aren't they?
Just FYI: “You miss 100% of the shots you never take” - Wayne Gretzky
This place is a graveyard
LMAOOO”GHS” IS THE SCHOOL I WENT TO HAHAHA NO WAY
I feel like “take” is a slightly stronger word than “occupy” in this context, maybe there’s a reference I’m missing.
I like how the russian guy starts out being canadian.
These comments are sketchy
Ukraine invade me and your gay Russian athletes sit at the farthest table away from the Ukrainian athlete table
lololol;
Americans*
It's funny how quick Americans are to forget about their own misconducts, while virtue signalling when someone does something even remotely similar. No one in the US has a moral high ground to shame others when it comes to intervention and armed conflict.
Gus Johnson more like this guy stinks
Well this didn’t age well
hmmm aged well? no ?  too real
ich bin ein fan bruder like
guess this didnt really age that well huh.. XD
I will forever believe this was Russia’s snapping point
omg
Stop
I bet the Russian guy and the Ukrainian guy got along super well.
Lol just got banned from olympics😂
Too soon
i guess you can say he's gonna be a "a gassy johnson" (cringe joke)
Best thing I’ve seen this year lol
Change it to isrealis instead of Russians and it would work perfectly as well
I feel like this is in poor taste
I'm glad you're back Gus! Missed ya
This actively gets worse as time goes on.
He's back let's go
Вот не думал, что он про нас начнёт шутить..
God damn Sam could you have better timing with your videos? LOL
This one aged well.
GUS IS BACKKKKK! love to see you in my feed again sir.
LOL
Yakov Smirnoff called, he wants his bit back.
Actually, we were quite welcoming of our ROC competition as we know that they have nothing to do with the war. /anti-humor
Well this aged poorly
No russia would just sit at the biggist table and tell you to go eat in your room. Well twiddling a nuke button between there fingers.
Why do I feel insanely bad for the “I go eat in my room”. I would’ve let him come sit with us but I know it’s staged and all i just feel really bad for the guy but the other parts made me laugh
Glad to see my man is back
I AM A RUSSIAN! *(Edit: literally i can dm you my passport on discord)*
Very funny, gus did not rap!!!
king of bad timing
If y'all hate him so much, you shouldn't be watching or commenting on the video just to give him more views and interaction.  The majority of this comment section is all hypocrites.
This one did age a little to good to fast
I thought Russian Athletes eat nothing but dope.
Yikes gl
You aren’t funny
Can't say.....that was a a bad one lol 😆
2 days, too early...I'm just gonna say that...
Back at your A game I see?
xD
have that slightly RADAL look
Take this video down
Well this aged like milk
Except this time, Russia decided to take the seat, with force
Gus, you are a #1 comedian of all time for me.  Best sense of humour ever. And this sketch is very funny but right know I cant even smile. I just whish Russia never existed. Very hard to live with neibourgh like this...
This is terrible
This aged like Nostradamus. 😬
yikes
uh oh
To soon GUS but still laughing my ass off
scram kid
Gus! Is back! Woop woop!
Trash
Gus just pulled a Simpsons future telling move...
This aged well.
Then Ukraine says. Let’s see if we can provoke Russia again and get that braindead Brandon guy in America to jump all over it. Man I love China, I mean Ukraine.
It aged…well it did age didn’t it?
I didn't get it the first time but I get it now
This video suddenly became a whole lot more relevant.
God help us!!!
This aged great
But after he got done eating in his room he grabbed his AK-12 and invaded Ukraine
This lived up well
Now more than ever. World War 3 is around the corner boys🤦🏾‍♂️
I go eat in my room… *sad Russian noises*
shabadoo is so based and hot tbh
Right below this video was the breaking news section 💀
Get ready for WWIII guys
Lol looks like he finally found a seat at the Ukrainian table.
Too bad he can't wear a pink beanie to let everyone know that he means them no harm  I'm pretty sure if he did wear a pink beanie one of the officials from his own country would get him arrested or shot
*This aged like milk knowing in less than a day after Russia invaded Ukraine*
Great timing gus
Awkward
this aged quickly
ukrain is gone now :((
400k views, excellent come back Gus. I can't wait for your next post.
Oh no guys uh oh uhhhh eeeeee well see you all in the military
now look at what you did :( lol
I know it’s only been two days, but this did not age well
He’s still got it 😂😂😂
pretty funny stuff ngl. nice to see Gus back
Really?
This didn’t age well…
Sucks because I’d be laughing if I didn’t Know what happened. 😞  I find myself almost quoting a Gus video and I’m like “Oh wait…” 😬
Last time I checked producing mediocre skits does not equate to taking accountability
funny but u and UK are pirates since u existed
this is to funny haha
We love you gus.
I think the Russians will eat lunch for Ukrainians, drop its own and will complain that they got nothing and Ukrainians are bad boys :D
Wendy Williams is losing her show.
False, Russian Olympians are so pumped full of drugs, that they have no appetite
gross
Manipulative
consent manufacturing machine go brrrrr
Было бы смешно, если бы не было так грустно
Love it man
End it
O human populations, the severe corona is a firm plan from Allaah who has Sent it to whoever disobeys the orders of Allaah generally, to submit and obey the command of His caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. Verily, whoever disobeys my order give him tidings of clinical death through a plan from He who has Appointed me His caliph on the worlds (Allah my Lord and your Lord) and there is no escape! Who is it that is coequal to Allah Lord of the worlds Glorified and Highly Exalted is He ?! Omicron would accept the truce of whoever obeys Allah and His caliph; for peace is best. But if you refused, soon a lot of nations will find themselves without presidents nor governments, and I will not allow any chaos between nations when they have no governments, as omicron will strike down whoever wants to cause corruption in the land by taking away people's money and business or violate their sanctities, verily omicron will knock him down immediately and will severely strike at every finger-joint of him to keep people's security after (Allaah) annihilates those who refused and acted arrogantly towards the command of Allaah the One the Overpowering to obey His caliph (as what has passed is not but mere warning and alarm of widespread evil) and he will never find anyone to protect him from the torment of Allaah's firm plan. How many times did I advise decision-makers at day and night to be servants of Allaah and to worship Allaah alone no partners with Him so they obey the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds (who is Allaah's servant like them) so they submit to the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani O Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, I swear by Him who has appointed me as His caliph; that is Allaah who you deny Him (my Lord and your Lord) if you did not release all Muslims inside the prisons of China along with all prisoners in general in the Chinese prisons, the firm plan of Allah, COVID, will strike you down along with all wrongdoers among your soldiers, like it (COVID) did to Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud O Xi Jinping, Bin Salman did not break his appointment out of his own accord but COVID; the firm plan of Allah has stricken him down into a clinical death like I had promised him before. And I have promised you with it, O Xi Jinping, along with those of your like in the worlds Go and ponder upon: (The Series of Statements About the Blood Gnat), and whoever wants to understand the news let him read it from the beginning to the end and that is for you to know that Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani truly knows from Allah that which you do not know, and those who understand and think know that Allaah has truly Appointed him His caliph on the whole world  certainty that Allaah will achieve His purpose even if He had to annihilate half of mankind who reached their rectitude so that they submit to Allaah's caliph and servant Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. So let each human flee to Ar-Rahman (Arabic: the Most Gracious) my Lord and your Lord; Allaah who there is no god except Him, my Lord and your Lord, and Lord of the heavens and earth and what is between them and Lord of the Great Throne. Also, know that Allaah Forgives all sins without exception; He is indeed the All-Forgiving the Most Merciful. And turn to Allaah in repentance from the great sins, injustice, and gross indecencies and flee from Allaah to Him I am indeed from Him to you a manifest warner and the decision neither belongs to me nor you. Know that Everything to do with this affair is in Allaah's hands and all matters return to Allaah (in decision) who Knows the treachery of the eyes and what chests conceal. Indeed Allaah is Capable of everything, and know that all things and all which has hit you are a determined decree in the Book Inscribed How many times did I warn you that you cannot resist Allaah's cosmic and covidious war, but you acted arrogantly! And my call has not increased wrongdoers among you except in denial of Allaah Lord of the worlds, and you neglected Allaah as if He is not the One behind the cosmic war, the so-called climatic, aerial, nautical, and terrestrial disasters! But they are due to the approach of the planet of torment (Saqar), and I have warned you of severe punishment from Allaah but you refused as if He is not the One behind His cosmic war and the war of His covidious soldiers! Glorified and highly Exalted is He above what you associate with Him! If Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is truly Allaah's caliph on the whole world, know that Allaah will achieve His purpose and know that He is Capable of everything Also, How many times did I warn you that you must worship Allaah my Lord and your Lord with insight (the Quran) from Allaah Lord of the worlds and that you must fear His torment through the piety of your hearts out of fear of Allaah the One, Exalted is He! He is indeed Worthy to be feared, and Worthy to forgive, but you feel secure against the plan of Allaah and only the losers feel secure against Allaah’s plan And I have already written to you a healing prayer for people in general in a statement on 26th of Ramadan 1441AH (19-05-2020AD), titled: Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement So read the whole prayer in it in the evening and in the morning, and know that therein is healing for what is in the chests. It also has the complete and conclusive solution for what you are experiencing of Allaah's cosmic and covidious war. O Allaah I have delivered so be my Witness and if you were arrogant towards this prayer, why should I grieve for people who are arrogant and wrongdoers?! Verily, judgment belongs to Allaah the Swiftest in account and planning; indeed He is the best of Judges Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds Allaah's caliph and servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani ___________ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani 08-Rajab-1443AH 09-February-2022 AD 05:56 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) ___________ 📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement's title): The COVID of No Escape From Death has Arrived 3 FehY..ِZX
You kinda sound like Gru
such a normie take on the whole thing
"I'll go eat in my room"  (enters the Ukrainian athlet room)
This is going to be an exiting war with all the memes. War is still terrible but at least there's going to be something for the peeps not participating
At first I was like: haha funny video, funny man.  But now I'm starting to learn the context behind this........still funny
this comment section☠☠ kjashjkdsa
I'm so glad you're making content again Gus man
Lmao I missed Gus's humor!
at least we still have diversity reeducation and the 6 colored flag if that's gone too russia wins
Is that a mfing The Office reference ?
Personally I think Russia would probably go out with their friends drinking and not take their sick wife to the hospital
d i s a p p o i n t i n g
wow! 300k views and barely 2k comments, most of which are positive! this is normal and not being filtered at all :)
Stop making fun of Russians
I didn't know Gus was in favor of needless war and lots of money for Raytheon. Not cool Gus.
Glad to see you bouncin’ back gus!
Haha this video is perfect I can't wait to get tickets to your stand up
Ack, thees situation give me such a Ukra-MIGRAINE
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
yikes.
This fuckin comments section is vicious! I mean who the fuck actually cares that much about this stuff. I'm talking to both sides of the argument here. Seriously. Take a valium.
😆
Oh shit yeah Gus is back!!!! Just came from listening to you dominate Conway songs 😂🤣.
Really?
This was funny and i mean that. I hope you and your ex-partner can sort out your differences. I also hope that people on both sides just stop stoking the fire and let these two adults sort this thing out that should have most obviously have remained private. And dear mod. I get you are deleting comments of people who are clearly doing nothing else than just making the situation worse and are enjoying this drama. But i think a degree of tolerance for constructive comments would not hurt for Gus's credibility.
are you still deleting comments gus
Since the beginning of 2021, 23 resolutions have been passed by local governments in Virginia to condemn China’s forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, mostly Falun Gong practitioners. Essex County, Staunton City and Fluvanna County are the latest government bodies to pass such resolutions.  The resolution passed unanimously by the Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors on November 3, 2021, reminded its citizens that they may become accomplices in killing innocent lives if they go to China for organ transplants.  The resolution says, “extensive and credible reports have revealed mass killing of prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, primarily practitioners of the Chinese spiritual practice of Falun Gong, but also other religious and ethnic minority groups, in order to obtain organs for transplants.”  It goes on to say that “[The Virginia Fluvanna Country Board of Supervisors] condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the persecution of Falun Gong and the state-sponsored organ harvesting of all prisoners of conscience currently being carried out by the Chinese Communist regime.”  The resolution urges the U.S. Government to thoroughly investigate organ transplant practices in China and take all reasonable steps to end forced organ harvesting.  Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a mind-body discipline that has been persecuted by the Chinese communist regime for the past 22 years.
this is silly but as a Ukrainian and a long time fan I really appreciate this
So glad I found this channel, dudes hilarious
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🎈
Welcome back Gus
Boy did that not age well
Legend
Literally go away
The Russian will come back in 30years time to claim that room.
Gus "Goose Poop" Johnson
Do a skit where you get used to using a laptop then when you use a desktop you slam the monitor onto the desk
would have been funny if he said it slightly different..."Is there a free seat that I could Occupy, err Take, I mean have?"
He sounds like Gru from despicable me
All you're missing are peace keepers.
Good timing also makes me thank of Eddie Izzard’s Death Star Canteen!
10 minutes ago I didn't know this channel existed. Now I'm a die hard fan!  :D
my second cousin is russian  he likes this video. mmmm we like him
You forgot to give credit to Michael Scott for the quote on the board
Someone follow 26 mic so he stops commenting
People are complex. Either you’ve said stuff you’re not proud of or you’ve never grown. The great thing about YouTube is you can just keep going and don’t need anyone’s permission. I absolutely would have broken up with someone who said they’d terminate a pregnancy and didn’t. Many people would have. I honestly hope you’re both ok. Keep the good shit coming!
”You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take” -Michael Scott
We’re gunna make this Ukraine/Russia conflict a meme war in no time.
I love this video holy shit the comedic timing!  Hope you're doing well buddy, you and everyone else involved!
WW3 is about to start and you made me laugh about it. God bless you man, I’m not even kidding. I’ve been so worried over this shit.
Your face is giving me an allergic reaction
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
wow ppl care way too much about drama mind ur own business..
I love you
just... no. its done
Who else is here just to mash that dislike button
Ah nyet ze Russians are here
10 out of 10!! hahah
Me a Russian, honestly i think they be shittin' on us at the Olympics, we ain't do anything wrong
There needs to be a joke about not giving the Europeans bread because he doesn't want to give them gas.
you left out the last part of that michael scott quote, "... -wayne gretzky"
I'm happy that I'm in the blast radius
The comment section disappointments me greatly
I love how the worldwide propaganda of "RUSSIA BAD" has never died, even 80 years after Joseph Stalin was the United States greatest comrade in WWII.
Do you know Adam Thorson
I feel so bad for the young Russians who just wanted to compete at the Olympics. The silver skating medalist said like “I hate this sport. I’m never doing this again”. Not fair for a 15 year old to get shit on by the whole world.
So many people acting like they care about what happened between him and her. Hope you stayed for the sponsered segment of her sob video! She stayed with him for years after to grow her channel lol.
Very funny!!! 😂😂😂
Ur bak
Cringe
Damnit Gus! Russia is invading now and you had to post this right before it happen?
for real though I wonder how they're dealing with this over there lol
He said he felt bad about what he did, he apologized, he moved on. Get on with your life instead of harassing him.
🖤❤ I've defended where I can, I'm going to move away now as not to keep drawing more negative attention. Good luck gus
Hope you're working on yourself during this time man. We want to see you succeed
Stop deleting all the comments and actually take responsibility for the criticism you’re receiving gus. Its super disappointing to see
Sitting next to Ukraine?
This guy don't sit right with me. Feels like he wants something from me.
The irony of making invasion jokes from the USA
Ayo gus i missed you
Lol!  Love it!
So this is how WWIII starts.
This didn‘t aged well real quick
L
Welp, it was nice knowing you Gus. Good luck in the gulag
poor babies 👶
L
I am way more oblivious then I previously thought. Can somebody explain this entire skit to me
China also bad
Was it Wayne Gretzky ?
ЕЕЕЕ, ВТОРЖЕНИЕ, ПАЦАНЫ! С ВЫХОДНЫХ НИКУДА НЕ ВТОРГАЛСЯ, ПОРА БЫ УЖЕ!
This dude had the video saved for the second Russia declared war.
Russia and ukraine are about to have a shared table soon
That isn't a real meal in China for the Olympians.  It is way too lavish.  Luckily for the US they brought food for their athletes.  Other countries weren't so lucky.  Athletes from other countries needing high protein high calorie diets just ended up having to skip training and sleep for most of the days due to a lack of high quality food options.
You forgot to put steroids on the platter
Now do American athletes in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, former Yugoslavia, and South America trying not to mention things being “the bomb”
Aged well
Gus back to his best!
Missed you Gus
The timing!
He needs to win an Emmy for this
Everyone laughs at Russia about this but look at china and now Canada. NO better.
Can't wait to see country no matter what your mom thinks
Glad you're back dude. :)
don't u have other things to do gus? like... more important stuff? c'mon man...
😂🤣😂🤣 hooool-eeee shit that was good hahaha didn’t even think of that. gotta be awkward
I do not understand this joke. Someone please explain
Not related random thought: imbianba Jomes and the will to live
You know what they say about this type of operation: "Chem men'she ty znayesh', tem luchshe."
Funny  Thanks
Three good jokes in 20 seconds. This man is raw comedic gold.
Actually hilarious
Hey Gus it sucks what you all went through man it will color your work for a while. Launch something knew on streaming platforms or film. Turn the disaster into a lived happily ever after just keep creating man you really have talent
Maybe they should have a vote where the russians should sit.
i go it in my room" probrably made me feel bad lol
I think the Russians just sit at a table right next to the Ukrainians and move it an inch closer every day
The best part of seeing world war 3 unfold in front of your eyes is the killer content and memes coming from it
The quote in the back is: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." -Wayne Gretzky
Russia: So China gets to have Taiwan but I can't claim my birth of right of Ukraine?
He’s back
As a ukrainian, this is painful
As a Russian this is me at lunch lol
why are you acting like jesse pinkman russian athlete edition?
you are being lied to gus
Ok. Now this is good
Is he like deleting the negative comments? I expected a wave of hate. I'm not taking a stance really, but I wasn't aware of any change in the public opinion.
imagine thinking this way as an american.
Your country is the only invader, Yankee.
BUHAHAHA!!!!!!
so glad to see gus finally made it into the olympics, those bike skills are paying off.
Rus johnson
Why would Gus fly all the way to China to make this sketch? Seems silly.
The wat that he just excepts his fate  —I go eat in my room
I appreciate this. Welcome back Gus Welcome back. Missed your content and felt so bad glad to see your back and better than ever.
Nice work
HE IS BBBAAACCCKKK!!!
Well, gotta say, I didn't expect to find this on HIS channel. Just left a a pandemonium and here it is again lol (laughed a bit, yep)
I have watched this video 3 times already and can’t stop
does gus really think this video is funny?
you forgot the steroid injection on the tray
Legend says that in his room, he has stash of vodka.
Meh.
This just...wasn't funny
I am slav
they have the revolver with 1 bullet next to em.
The US propaganda is strong in this one. But to be fair, this seems more like a cheap shot than anything else.
Mybe russia should invade your ass
Russian has a nice choice of breakfast. 👍👍
gus johnson at the cafeteria table
Missed you
This is clearly fake! His tray isn’t full of performance enhancing drugs.
I don't get it!? Was that a Russian accent or is he just still from the land of the Spotted Cow?
Probably took 5 minutes to write the script and 5 days to practice that accent
His videos keep geting shorter XD
We love you Gus
bad taste
I love Russians.
Subscribe for more garbage.
This is too accurate
good jokes :)
Gus "Vladimir" ""Putin"" Johnson

Thank you for this Gus. Good to know you are not with the psychopaths...
And by his room he means their rooms.
this aged like milk and it's an hour old
Gus, the subs are decreasing.  Put your work out. The loyal fanbase has dwindled, the rational one will not. Put your work out. Grind on.
Back in action baby! Best sketch I've seen in while
👏👏
lol
proof cancel culture doesn't actually exist
gus not caring about [REDACTED] is so based
He sounded Canadian at first.
I mean honestly this is just not funny given the tragedy of the situation.
I’ll let Gus Johnson videos occupy my YT timeline anytime.
Komrade, you have semen in your moustache.
sounds like gru
This invasion of Ukraine is brought to you by Gatorade
Dear Gus, how do you think of these sketches??? You must be Momus, the Greek god of comedy 😂
🥱
If you are watching the US legacy media for info about Russia you are being fed misinformation.
sad...u being political...
flop
Considering what Putin announced less than an hour ago, this is ON POINT and ON TIME.
Sabrina weaponized her trauma amongst other things… im sure she experienced a whole range of emotions that you wouldnt want anyone to feel… but since we are all sharing our opinions here… seems like she turned what was probably just a failing relationship into a lil stick of dynamite and tried to blow up gus’ career out of spite. She said herself “i have never been to couples therapy” after gus mentioned their attempts to salvage the relationship and when gus posted those screenshots of their meetings it became “they arent therapists”. She was being spiteful knowing full well what Gus was talking about in that instance. There is plenty more to go off of for whoever is bored enough to respond. This is the first time I actually saw the horde rightwingers talk about. Gotta love that sweet hit of dopamine that you get from being a part of something though…
I want to know how you got the high school to let you do this
It's not often I don't like a Gus Johnson video. Its annoying af how doping scumbags always represent all of Russia or any other country.
"I'll just take my meal and PUTIN more effort to win next time"
Gus please make a skit on how the people who play the mobile ad demos would look. You know like for example the obvious choice is to move the object from point A to B, but the cartoon finger thinks for a bit then moves the object from point A to yellow.
Y’all take his personal life… too personal. Jesus.  Great vid Gus!
Not funny
Hey I'm gonna talk shit and remind people about the bad stuff you did, would you like to delete my comment now or should I list some stuff first?
Very glad to see you making stuff again Gus, I missed your comedy
Banger
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 Слава Україні 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
As a Russia itself, yeah
🤣
oh god lmaooo
Just annex another lunch table
I WOULDNT SEND AN ANIMAL TO CCP CHINA TO COMPETE .. ATHLETES BEING 'POISONED'
Довольно точно)
its so impressive Gus became a Russian athlete just for this one sketch
I REALLY HATE GUS , because he is so damn funny 😈👍
I don't get the "dope" part...  And I'm too lazy to look it up  Edit: looked it up because I didn't feel lazy anymore  Guess Rush Uh is infamous for doping up their athletes
Это действительно забавно
He's back baby. Rad..
Blyat
😂👍🏻
ahahahahahahahaha good joke aahahahaha.  go on eating your opium
Quick someone teach Gus about the cathedral.
You must already be getting some of them "refugees" from Ukraine
They’d be like “hey that’s my spot! I sat there once two weeks ago!”
There are a suspiciously low amount of bot comments on this video...  I'm beginning to think Gus actually infiltrated the Russian lunch table.
I hope you all have a great day!
Bye Gus it's been fun
Yeah gus!!!!!
I don't get what's wrong with "this food looks pretty dope", can anyone explain the joke please?
Always great to see you, dear! Live long and prosper, y’all!
I'm Russian so 🖕🖕🖕🖕
A take on China would have been more funny. They're the actual threat. Russia has no fucks to give.
bruh fell off
Solidarity with Sabrina. Unsubbed.
You must be really happy to have dislikes turned of.
🤣👌
He never misses!!! 😂
Ahh, yes potential ww3, funny.
The king has returned with another funny vid huzzah
Poor Russian Olympian, he just wants to fit in 😭
Governments and their decisions creating tensions among decent people yet again.
РОССИЯ НОМЕР 1 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Hilarious
Love how we still can laugh and make jokes in these dark times, Legendary Gus! 😎
Not Russian athletes, ROC athletes
Boop
Damn we really are reverting back to cold war propaganda huh
He's Back!
*And remember, Russian President Putin doesn't want a war.*
Hahahahaha good one Gus
The comments are mostly people going on about the gf situation and actual teenage commies. Cringe all round.
сука:(
"I'll go eat in my room"  (enters the Ukrainian athlet room)
lol
Glad to see your back Gus!
Why is this the only channel that has such good comments?     Ah and no bots😂
Love the video, but sports and politics should never be mixed irl
I mean the US literally does all those same things lol
You go, Gus! Welcome back, man!
Looks better than what they're eating
Your missing the part where there are no more seats in the cafeteria so they just go to the Ukrainian table
Reminded me "li'l hitler" episode of robot chicken😄
lol
Damn the comments make it seem like he murdered his wife jfc can we all calm down, neither of these people deserve hate it was a pretty personal thing and they got through it and now it's over. People are just hating cause they love to hate and I doubt any of the people making the nasty comments are older than 15.
dislike, man. im russian and you hit me in the heart with this sarcasm of yours. not funny at all
Slow day at the office? Low hanging fruit much?
Haha joking about russian expansionnism as a young american imperialist! funny!
I’m so glad you’re back man.
Wayne Gretzky said it, Michael Scott sublimated it
That Russian Accent Will Leave A Mark For Ukraine
My nose did an air.
Now do it with a Chinese accent!
Lmfao
As a Russian I can confirm, we violate each person I mean evaluate each person equally
This ain't it, sorry.
normaly a big fan of u gus but your russians accent just does not work.
Must be hard when most of the world gobbles up propaganda about you like it's their last meal.
Facts... I mean true!
Yes gusssss
Cringe 😬
Saw the upload notification and I clicked. Not disappointed at all
Everyone else giving the ol' NATO eye.
GUS GUS GUS GUS GUS
AA why are so many people here? Must not be that harsh of a winter to visit.
*THIS IS ALMOST Colbert level of cringe, sorry.* Rehashing mass media propaganda against "enemies" is not what comedians should do, it is not even below "low hanging fruit".
Confess
"Ukraine move, I'm sitting next to Poland for lunch!"
lmao
And gun Watson does it again!
Gus famous last skit
Ok i won't stab people.
Substitute Russians for americans and this becomes more true
Hah
I imagine the Russian Olympians apologizing to the Ukrainian Olympians, because not everyone in their country supports their nations actions.
While I of course disapprove of Russia's politics, this could also be the US in the Middle East or Vietnam. Just sayin'.
claim your 1hr ticket here
🅱️us 🅱️ohnson
hahahahahah this is hillarious
An accurate example of what kind of food is being served at the Olympics
redo 'my garden' with a russian accent
Yeah I think Nato is already in too many tables... wait there's someone knocking on my door brb
We are just numbers to him if you by chance forgot…
I don't get the "dope" part
gus im sorry but thats gotta be the worst video youve made
Good to see gus is getting back at it
Im russian and that's actually me😂
Gus is Gru? 🤔
i love it when I'm russian but i have a polish accent
Ok this is epic
As always thank you Gus, I needed a laugh 😂😂
China be like "You can sit on my lap" *wink*
>Implying Russians are the only ones invading other countries >Implying Russians are the only ones taking dope/enhancement drugs to win at the Olympics  Oh boy
"I don't mean to invade."  Oh no
Best accent ever
I'll go eat in the annex... I mean room.
И в чем он не прав?
omg is that fpsrussia from fpsrussia?
Gus at the YouTube cafeteria...
The first part of this sounded like a New York accent and I was very confused.
is good, dah?
We need more God's country videos
Lolol
Love you gus
sup
I actually snort-laughed “I don’t want to invade..ahem..INTRUDE..”. 🤣
We are all humans… last time I checked they made mistakes, kind of a lot.  However it’s if they learned and grew from those mistakes that determines if they human’d correctly or not.
In Soviet Russia: Cafeteria eats at You
Ughhh, idk why but the Gatorade bottle made me laugh so much 😆😂😂😂
vrussia
no outro interesting
The comeback
I LOVE UR VIDS GUS
Pretty sure it's our table, not just their table
Love you Gus! Keep ‘em coming!
Man you are not allowed to make those jokes...
i cant really come up with a creative joke about how gus johnson is a shit human being but gus johnson is a shit human being
I mean, I guess they can sit with China. Or Canada at that rate.
As a Russian I can confirm that this is quite accurate
And shortly after this video was posted, gus was never seen again. Gone but never forgotten. 🙏
I’m Russian. So true. it’s kinda sad. Hate politics
Poor mans just wants to make international athlete friends and his country is making it impossible for him 😔
Not funny
Am i early no but this is pretty dope dose it not
Hahahaha nice XD
This comedy sketch brought to you by the U.S. state department. Jokes aside this is more irritating than the stuff people are trying to cancel you over. I'm out fam.
Poor ruskies
As a Ukrainian I can relate to this 🥲
Russians nervously: We don't mean to invade. Americans nervously: We don't mean to bomb. All Europeans nervously: We don't mean to colonize.
nice russian impression. sounds accurate?
He was really Russian off to his room at the end.  I'll leave now..
that was pretty rough
Sometimes you wonder how he still comes up with unique skits every time
You working for CNN AND dying legacy media in general now too? You do know that Russia isn’t a threat right? The US GOV is pushing for war for a reason. Are you an authoritarian also now? Wtf is with all these weirdos that keep worshipping the establishment and government like that’s cool… it’s not cool and it’s actually insane. Ukraine has said they’re fine many times. The gov uses war all the time. It’s another one of their agendas. Wtf do I have to explain this? God damn morons. Are you like ethan from h3? He used to be funny too. He used to at least make a little bit of sense many years back before he went full bizarro world lefty. The lefty supporters used to be against war now they’re all about it. Why because they’re authoritarians. Nice job trying to demonize people who are not the real threat. The real threat and people to criticize is our own government and the governments which are far more tyrannical.   But muh russia!!!! FFS. LEARN ABOUT REAL SHIT.
Hundreds of praise comments posted 13 minutes ago, is Gus really so low as to hire bots?  Lmfao
"Can you pass me the salad dressing? It really spikes the dish up. What? I say not spike."
2000 - people are joking about the "russian" accent; 2007 - people are joking about the "russian" accent; 2022 - people are still joking about the "russian" accent.
food is pretty *dope.*
<3
this is so fucking funny, but russia is the best
"I don't mean to Inva- Intrude..."
This video is a result of believing mainstream, corporate, operation mockingbird media. Baaaa
unsubbed. Russia #1
Man, I've really been missing the podcast lately. But sometimes, things happen that you can't control.
good job gus... you've done it again.
😂😂
Well, you know the old saying: "Starve a covid, feed a cold”
This is like how kids are always using memes you need tiktok background to understand... But for, adults who know what's going on in the world
oh man this is so good
Nice
i am Russian and I can confirm I do this every single time
"I go eat in my room.." I teared up. Deserves an Oscar for the pure emotion put behind one simple sentence. Brilliant, Gus.
Not enough genocide. 8/10.
It's true. Russian people are getting bullied all over the place for power struggle between 3 big counties.  It sucks tbh.
I am Russian and I will stand beside Gus to help him out in a look for a non occupied seat! (insert overly loud Soviet Anthem afterwards)
When I saw the new upload, I came Russian.
Nice
*penetrates into neighbouring room*
I don't know man
That’s a nice crane You have there I would want Ukraine I mean your crane
The Chinese literally disqualify a dozen countries athletes in different sports so they can medal and you pick Russia to mock..."Bold move there Cotton, let's see how it plays out". 😒😒😒
Olympics is just competitive drug using.
It's always so cool to see a monolingual American base their joke on someone having an accent or a problem choosing a stylistically correct word!
Our legend is back When Gus uploads it makes my day 😂 Greetings from the Netherlands bro
I think the Russians just sit at a table right next to the Ukrainians and move it an inch closer every day
🤣🤣🤣👏
love you gus sorry youve been through tough times
BEFORE ONE HOUR GANG!!!!!!
—Wayne gretsky —Michael Scott
Better than I expected
Me:  Wondered why Gus hasn't been making videos. Also Me:  *Visits comment section* uh oh...
Borders are just imaginary lines on a map
Wayne Gretzky/Michael Scott said that.
Lol nice
I give it 4 more videos
It would’ve been even funnier if the title was about a Ukrainian cafeteria XD
"Heeey China, love what you did with the place! Always wanted the same type of backyard as you do!"
Surprising he can go from this to a 14 year old girl singing with a ukulele
why do i get the impression that gus just saw a red jacket and was like *yep*
putting my prediction here: goes in gonna go far-right
Brilliant
"In Soviet Russia, cafeteria intrudes you!"
One of Gus’ most timely videos. Hits too close to home 😂
hell yeahhh love to see you posting again gus!!! :)))
You da man Gus, hope to see more content coming out again soon! This was hilarious.
I like how you included the dope lol, they got caught again
Blyat - Russian athlete after trying to unsuccessfully eat in the olympic village, probably...
Brutal 🤣
This works double-y because of the ongoing international crisis involving Russia and the drama stuff
Short, simple, to the point and funny asf. Wonder if i'll find this scrolling through insta one day
Hahahaha awesome  Kee it up, Gus
Noice

Shit this is really good
Минус кошка-волк и пять социальных пакетов данному сударю)  удар!
The EMPEROR WAS here
He knows what he said.
Lol.
I don't mean to invade or intrude (Ukraine), I go eat my room (Belarus or Russia)
Why does it have to be a russian olympian Couldn't it just be a random russian person
*in Russian accent* "I relate to this on personal level"
tank where are they ..?
The earliest I have been to a Gus Johnson video lol.
Great michael scott quote.
Nice to see that Gus is still continuing to make decent content after all this.
he’s back
The new adventure of:"ИХ ТАМ НЕТЫ"
This makes me think of a weird High School where every student is a country
Love him or hate him, this is actually pretty funny
Will be interesting
I can't tell if it isn't really funny or I just can't laugh at gus anymore but man this is mediocre
Awesome vid Gus!!
"I am a Ourlimpic I mean a Olympic player"
I just can't watch these anymore.
Hahaha... the only difference being that they don't give the athletes food in Beijing.
Luv u gus your comedy is my oxygen 🤟
