I Found The Rarest Items In Minecraft Hardcore https://youtu.be/jtivpE4GGX0?si=34EeG2Yb-FingqgA
How many hours do you spend making your videos? Also your one fo my favourite Minecraft YouTubers my favourite was technoblade god rest his sole 😢
peak unemploeed
Hello mate
Man those old versions of minecraft look so good
You wouldn't steal an ocean
It'll be fine. It wasn't fine. 🤣
Nothing like 3-year-old Minecraft nonsense in the afternoon.
Bro get the fortune and silk touch pickaxe😁
Now you have to put the nether in the overwhelm, so just putting it over in the nether
Strange
Next time, use torches they’re insta-mine and will break when the ice melts
Bro broke the laws of physics in Minecraft
4:16 laver ocean
You could have just built a fake nether ya know...💀
Ik the ghasts would LOVE it😭✌️
The sheap and pig they're safe and change his mind
His smol face wiggling
you forgot the trees and the fish in the neather
In Minecraft Java Hardcore mode, there are over 3,000 possible tropical fish variations. I challenge u to collect all of them
If I had the dedication of Kolanii, There would be a detailed Minecraft version of the Outsiders out there.
TONIGHT, WE STEAL…ZA REEF 12:40
this video = ~ becaus ei hate this versions
8:28 this the most emotionless "i might cry" i have ever heard
9:32 copper armour?😮
did Kolanii just solve racism in MINECRAFT??
Now do the same but the opposite
who else from a short/reel/tiktok?? 😭
17:56 e
17:47 unruined portal
"Beta 1.6 test build 3. Unlicenced copy! :(" Should be "Beta 1.6 test build 3. Unlicenced copy! :)"
17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 17:11 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:23 “Test build” that’s why
What do u do between videos
5:13 that's the crater of the shockwave from Saitamas light punch
Make a separate world where you terraform every dimension
Putting a ocean of water in the middle of the nether is cool and all however yesterday my uncle put a ocean of milk up my ass
Go srrrr000000000😂😂😂😂
Why didn’t he just take the stack of ice that was in the chest and duplicated it
"time to steal a village" british museum type beat
How will god respond to you tampering with hell and sending an entire village there
You genuinely have the best commentary on youtube
Can you fish?
I wish we could terraform nether eventually - that ocean with island looks so cool :)
Bro just blew up hundreds of families 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Final stage of no life
9:10 thats the fun part, boats were just like this in early minecraft. They were slow and jank and pretty much did nothing and would break if they touched land
Wosh
15:04 to 15:06 sounds like he said the n word lol
Water in the nether is never not unsettling... There is just something about it that makes me itchy all over.... Not physically... But you get what I mean
Now make a portal in the island that goes to the nether on the overworld
you did a god damn world record
donimant hand = left 👇 donimant hand =right               👇
Don’t you have a whole stack of ice?
iylyl
"Iniciate" yikes
Impressive
Any one else think he sounds like Joe sugg?
how do you get 1.6 test build 3
6:07  im getting attacked roughly every 2 minutes currently
Epic
good video tho
im so surprised how you survived on this world for so long
13:47 can't place water mf what did you just build in the title of this video ☠️🥀
9:26 I think he got attacked by the jittering.
Did anyone forget about commmands?
Annyone in 2026
Kolanii if only you new what happened to your world
It's like a really warm, warm ocean.
I like it how Kolani don't make hundreds of videos on one project like other YouTubers
necroposting because youtube decided i should see this vid  1:42 the lake is freezing because in older versions snow wasn't a set biome and was basically a second biome layer. so everything looks normal then water will freeze and when it rains/snows you will finally know if you built in a "snow biome" lmao
holy moly the dedication. wow.
1:52 LOL
Bro I hope you are using cheats, why would you do this to yourself
Man why did he have to leave out the sheep
15:25 ah yes, you're about to go on the ride of *_you are life_*
It's a lake at best
The video was incredible.. u inspired me to work ..
“Heather Nortal” got me man 😂
That is my friend
nice
You know what else is massive THE LOW TAPER FADE 4:57
17:12 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Respect
A few days ago, I got a iron pickax with silk touch and fortune on it from an enchanting table in the latest update
9:27 That's literally the worst possible thing that can happen in the early versions that's the jittering if you had gotten really stuck it could've clipped you out of ur world
GUYS, I THINK I FOUND MY NEW FAVORITE YOUTUBER🎉 (ᴀʟsᴏ ᴍʏ ғᴀᴠᴏʀɪᴛᴇ ᴠɪᴅᴇᴏ)
15:21  say that again...
White settlets in africa. Circa 1930 Colorized
please
Ah yes, a cake floor. Sleep on a bed in there and you'll wake up eatn' alive by ants
how?
how did you only just got the fish in a bucket achievement?
Dude frost walker wouldve been pretty hand to remove the glowstone
9:15 now place a oak log and drop raw beef on it and near it drop a raw chicken
I think bro are recording in prisson this video
:0
How I HAT... no wait ... not like videos like this one. Yeah do this and that trick .... awww come on. You lost me as a viewer with the first video I ever saw from you. Bye :D
My faith in logic has been destroyed
Gotta say that house always gets a snicker out of me good show good show
Kolanii: "you just need to put fire next to it. dUh."
Kolanii: "But its okay because there's not that many." literally like millions of glowstone blocks.
No space for all my illegal items😂
Kolanii, those aren’t the only ones, what about Add-Ons in Java, and Mods in Bedrock
Mojang bro why did u do that :
THE PETHER NORTAL
Bro could have just place glowing lichen in lava in a 1.18 snapshot 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Honestly, why do you torture yourself like this
If you need do again you might have been able to just break the spawners
1:54 "wait i have an entire stack of cake-"
The placing sand reminds me of my current built Mountain under megabase project the amount of DIRT I HAVE PLACED IS UGHHHHH!!!!! 😭
5:57 how you know someones been playing minecraft for a while instead of running scared hearing a ghast we say "where is it"
Actually there’s an update where if you place some glow lichen and destroy it or something you can get water
The ghast are happy now :D (because there was an ice age in the nether.)
Reminds me of the town at the start of Terranigma.
Love the vid!!!
Kolanni I love your videos my parents have been arguing recently and your videos help me feel better when I’m sad keep up the good work
if you used torches you woulden have had to destroy the glowstone -_-
Worth it
mouse
I was skeptical most of the way through but it turned out really nice
How is this guys world not corrupted
Spongebob got mad
I love how it looks like a chunk of the Overworld somehow got stuck in a wormhole and ended up in the Nether
13:20 israel simulator
How w
1:20 what?
Most cursed video period change my mind or agree with me 👇                        👇
Two enchantments, on a pickaxe, that should not work on the same pickaxe
16:1
Youf didt the unposible in minecraft😳
14:50 ... yes ik im late
1:21 Bayta?
Re-watching this masterpiece again❤
Im gonna kidnnaped your mom.
I'm just waiting for him to turn the nether into the overworld
Nether terraformation.
Mojang found out that "Kolanii drowned whilst trying escaping Piglin Brute"
Is this what world generator bas fo go through everytime someone makes a new world?
Soul torches (or anything with soul fire) scared pigmens (or piglins, i don't remember) btw
7:9 I HATE U FOR HURTING MY BABIES MY CHIKS
How do villagers sleep in nether
Kolanii’s brain wasn’t functioning
I wish nothing was here to watch the original creater
Haters are gona say you cheated but you didn't
That baby piglin at the blacksmith is literally a child spamming a soundboard 😂
bro made the city of ember in minecraft
dubai = man made city kolanii = man made lakes, reef, island
you do know that there is gravel on the sea floor too right?
Your my favorite youtuber your vids are funny and creative your doing great
ahh good idea
"Glad to know the world is already falling apart." Ahhhh, the OGs will know that back then, it was GENERATED like that.
bro literally took “i can fix her” next level
Kolanii, here is a challenge, make a duplicate of your world, and fight 100 zombies
Aint no way
Minecraft Stylosa
he’s helping ghasts
just why
5:00 “absolutely MASSIVE” “the render distance is so SHOCKING”       Do you know…           What else is massive?
“Gonna steal an entire reef” sounds like something I’d hear in Despicable Me
1:44 this also happened to me. After a certain update in beta, my base was suddenly considered to be in a snow biome and froze over. I really confused 15 year old me thought that minecraft added seasons XD
How do you go back in the old Minecraft game?
Now this is the best nether terraforming ever!  I better see everyone who terraforms the nether do this or i will dislike their video to hell...
Love the content! I subbed liked and I hope you get to 10M subs!
How much free time does one possibly have 😭
3:16 bro survived the ice age 💀💀💀💀
11:47 *HOW AND WHY*
farfadox already did this, stills kinda crazy that was possible at some point of minecraft
ım just sorry for you hoppfully you find fame and riches in the near future
2:00 - Door Sound Was Nostalgic… 😅
That one unemployed friend
You're computer is gonna be dead after this
Shouldn't u use torches rather then glow stones?
Can I use your video
Crazy to think that he just ripped a man’s home into another dimension
BBBBRUUUUH
Bro ignored the scariest glitch/entity in the old Minecraft 9:26 (the jittering ,wenzo explained the jittering in a vid while trying to get to the nether farland)
9:12 the world wasnt breaking, its just that boats were very bad and weird in those snapshots
the reason you got stuck there 9:23 for a sec is cuz in indev-beta versions theres these so called 'jittery chunks', many ppl have lost their worlds cuz of these, u were lucky to get out of it in time before u lost all ur process, how do ik that? wenzo made a video abt finding the rarest structure, the further out u go, the more they appear, so yeah, they may be a big threat if ure playing in way older versions now, dont go out too far! ^^
9:08 funnily enough that IS exactly how the boat worked back then, you weren't there for it were you kolanii...
I like how funny you are I've watched all ur videos 2 times.  🤣
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Love your channel kolanii❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4:56   you know what else is massive?
Its crazy how much I laughed cause of this video 😂
bro is actually insane at building! like how so u build an island
I count going back updates is cheating
Wotte, no im just kidding, goog vid man
Now transform the nether to the ather.
Kolanii this video made me laugh and was very entertaining so you earned a new subscriber!
realy enjoid this vid whilst eating my pizza
0:10 You wanna use command blocks to build a working phone to order a pizza you can do that
Sir you've committed 58 war crimes and blew up the moon Kolanii: yea something like that
Most unhinged video ideas ever 👌
I really enjoy those "making nether habitable" videos. Really wanna make something like this on my world
1:04 Fire and Water
4:57 you know what else is massive.                                LOW TAPER FADE
9:20 bro experience the jitter
Massive?
Finally someone finally terraformed the nether into the overworld
pov that one mojang employee who has to build every seed
7:49 makes me think he is in creative 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
How did You die? Me: i drouwned. Friend: but didnt You go to the nether? :
I love how he couldn't figure out old boats.
The Nether Nocean

4:57 Massive? 5:01 Massive? 5:06 Massive?
I wouldn't want to live in a village where one single wrong move could result in my bed just spontaneously exploding either. 😅
9:26, Oh no, you found THE JITTERING
‏‪0:23‬‏ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣 pether nortal
pether nortal
Bro is one of fhe minecraft's acient builders 😂
Ghast can go back home
Looks nice  I also forgot about the beds 😂
Man I didn’t even know the ice trick to get water in the nether was even patched out
5:08 he just keeps saying it
12:28 bro actually could’ve died here 😭💔
I was in hell looking at Heaven
Type shi UAE and Saudia Ariaba does:
you sound like dantdm
Rip strider no lava
this has inspired me to spend way to much effort on downloading beta 1.6 test build 3
5:15 let’s take some nothing😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What can ugly skinned Minecraft hardcore youtubers cant do nowadays
This is like Elon Musk transforming Mars
What my unemployed friend does on a monday:
Mans like gru but rather than steeling the moon he steals an ocean, a reef, and a village
Every time I watch a Kolanii video, my brain has 1 question.           *why?*
2:26 reminds me of my first building
I need to do something like this
Ruend why does my iPad hate that?
Rue d portal that’s not rued that’s nice and the villagers could use the portal to get out
if you looked, the illegal pickaxe actually had been created from level 34...
And you know what else is massive?
12:19 "these big big big" got me rolling 😂
Bro was doing it like it was routine
How are u not on the FBI’s watchlist
Give my channel a chance... prewwty pls
4:58 Two years ago, you probably never thought I would do this. You didn’t even know who I was two years ago. What else is massive?
Did kolani retire? 🥀😢
The type of shit the average minecraft YouTuber does in hardcore
And thus did Kolanii discover the Happy Ghast and bring it to the rest of us.
evil climate change be like
Minecraft hardore players are the oposite of speed runners
Alternate title: Englishman steals things from the past, kidnaps random villagers and relocates them to his new colony whilst destroying various natural habitats
POV someone goes into the portal: WHAT THE F-
You can use moss and azalea for lusher and more vibrant green in your build
12:48 casual day near Australia
“Say it together now Thats not physically possible” Also 3/8 phases were “Regret Life Choices”
hes the perfect amount of british
Bro just terraformed the nether
Damn it would be fun joining you playing along XD
How to get beta 1.6
I think he's actually done
THE NETHER
The bermuda triangle of minecraft except you just reach the nether
3:46 no
Couldn't he just go to the version of minecraft where u just press B and get creative then get what he wants, not accusing as I'm not familiar with his content but it seems viable
can i get the world file?
0:05 I SWEAR IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
Hi
The ghasts: YIPEEEEEEE WE HAVE WATERRRRRRRR IM SOOOOOOO HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYY THANKKKKKKK YOUUUUUUUUUU PLAYERRRRRRRRRR

You can mine infinite diamonds with that illegal pickaxe
Wow
17:10 got me 💀
Pether nortal
m-m-m-massive???
Low taper Fade

I love how Minecraft doesn’t patch this type of these things like in your illegal items video because it keeps the game more free
To summarise, he built an ocean in the nether
16:07 よく眠れましたか？       なぜ降りてくるのですか？ただ書いているだけですよ。😂😂                                                                                            .                                     無料でここに来てくれてありがとう😂😂😂😂😂😂

If you have water in the nether already it is possible to move sources if you know what you're doing...
my bet for beta 1.6 test build 3 chest gen is they were testing map colors...
what is the background music at 18:15
I don’t think it has anouth water
Kolanii the goat
Both of these enchantments can’t combine normally
3:39 I got a bow with infinity and mending once
Massive?
this comment section is a combo of small kids and AI...
Fast forwarded and wondered why piglins were spawning in the overworld. Hell of a good job
bro violated the word massive  😭

Make a bit of the nether in the overworld

thank you for accompanying me in the shower, kolanii
He just upload his world
"People in Hell want Ice water"
"ok yeah that looks nice" *ghast spawns* "how and why"
The pether nortal would have been so much easier with the end portal blocks😂
this is by far the most humorous Minecraft Youtuber
5:05 Massive?
The nether without lava looks mesmerizing
It looks ssooo wrong
Creative mode
You know what else’s massive low taper fade
Dumb question, if he updated this to current version, would the water just evaporate?? Cause I'm debating going back to an old version, replicate something like this, and then update
5:06 you know what else is massive
5:00 massiv?
Hello DanTDM...u sound like him soo much
And bye youtube for just 11 Months
Silk touching Fortune silk touch makes it so that you pick up the block instead of picking up the item. Fortune makes you pick up more items depending on what fortune level you have. So depending on what fortune you have, if you are so lucky I guess to get Fortune and self touch. But most likely means you'll get twice as much as LeBlanc like twice as much iron ore
THE SPONGES GOT REVENGE
11:16 among us
That video make me subscribe the channel
You know what else is massive?
Well... was it worth it?
Villagers don’t blink
How can villagers sleep in the nether but players can’t?
I had to subscribe
There's a lotta k's on ur head uhhmm. Don't think it's intentional lol
Hey dude I just thought of this why didn’t you just use tnt on the glowstone
16:20 man...
what's the seed ??/
pether nortal lol
wanna know what else is massive...                                    the lowtaper fade meme
12:39 tonight, we steal the reef!
you know what else is massive? 5:05
This feels so wrong
one stack of nothing is insane
Hi :yt:
its white because they used the old texture for when they called redstone gears
A petter nortal
14:50🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Part of me hopes this is fake so he didn't wast this much time
6:42
Should've placed the ice all along the edges of the sand so it would just make an infinite water source all the way up  It also would've been way faster and it wouldnt have just been a single layer of solid water  The way it currently is it's basically a bunch of waterfalls going straight down so it's awkward to swim in and fish will get stuck on the bottom
10:43 My guy... You know that it was water below the glowstones right?... You could have just made a TNT duper above the ocean, which would've destroyed all the glowstone and not harm the ocean at all...
my brain: wouldnt a chunk update cause all the water to go bye bye because that works on ticks? Me: dang thats an extestensial minecraft crisis
You forgot cats
putting ocean in nether❌ pulling off a heist on the overworld and using the nether as a safe house✅
Hi
5:04 You what else is massive? 😃
I hate those big big big
2:55 i am in your walls
a good life in hell
I would just use worldedit.
17:12  GHAHAHAHAHA
Ocean ruins not monuments
This guy put an ocean in the nether
i was laughing so hard until i was @YouTube’s comment😤
I cant take it s3rious with his face😂😂
Imposible
the nostalgia i get from watching this is insane
Anyone else thinks he sounds like Simon Cowell?
Damn.
"It would still take 27 hours to fill it"  "HEY THERE it's Josh from Let's Game it Out, HOLD PLEASE Also ROOKIE NUMBERS"
Pode ser uma pergunta burra mas vamos lá:  como ele conseguiu carregar a versão antiga da seed dele sem bugar e ainda carrega-la com as coisas que ela já havia feito?
Netherlands
this is insanity. nice work
Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Baba Babai
It looks so cursed..
Normal day of ohio
can someone tell me what that block is? at 0:25, not the bedrock, the dark blocks below and above
Fantastic island ❤❤❤ awesome video 😂
How the f*ck did you do that in 18 minutes
16:04
now getting lava is time consuming
I love these illegal videos I hope Minecraft doesn't find this! XD
Villagers can sleep in nether is so cursed.
bro really built an artificial ocean in the nether. cool stuff
13:01
.13:1
Using time travel to terraform the nether.
This looks so wrong but so cool at the same time
i love how unnecessary the steal of the villager's house was
You can put the doors on the side, so they can’t be broken.
Omg how much time did you put into this? Insane amount of dedication :) Amazing my guy!
Good sir, you have answered the "how" so my only remaining question, is WHY
YOU BILT AUSTERALEYA
OP
I used a command but the water was a lil red
as a kid playing 1.2.5 i had such a wicked blaze farm using the ice glitch, if i remember right you could also farm squid in the nether crazy efficiently cause they would spawn there after you place the water, and there was nowhere else spawnable for them
You're crazy... That'll never spawn in my head to make a village on a normal world in the Nether... And on hardcore... Congratulations bro
17:13 it’s gonna be fine it wasn’t
ok but how did it place beds in the nether lol
this video feals wrong to watch
Lol that ammount of glowstone out of nowhere makes it wo obvious he is cheating if anyone had any doubts
the accent omg 😍
REEF is actually my name🪸
Minecraft beta 1.6 test build 3
Now Kolanii is wanted in every continent
I too would try running away if I was randomly transported to a village in literal hell
18:21 so true!
plssss can you give the world file so we can play
the thumbnail map looks like the GTA 3 map
Did you know that cake doesn't fill your hungerbar why will i eat cake if it dosent even fill my hungerbar????
Bro just workes for team sea🗿🍷
On my way to watch every single video:)
17:34 thats altitude, up and down from the ground or from the centre of the world outwards. Latitude is distance to and from the poles, has nothing to do with height 🤓
How does that glitch work to transfer items from an old version to a new one? It clearly wasn't the same world
Sad you can’t live there because you’ll explode 😂
Your skin is bum ass ugly
ummm this is the minecraft poilice this is verrrrrrrrry illiagal
How are the beds not blowing up in the nether?
Video is stuck at 144p and i cant change it. My connection is perfectly fine
Do the opposite.
Trasform the nether completely
From the stack of Spähers bro really could of broke the spawners to get xp
Welp, hope the piglins learn to make the best out of this forced neighbourhood.
Wait... How...
noone would have known if you recorded yourself playing like 10 blocks and then world edited in the rest of the sand.  Not to take anything away from the video, just saying you could save yourself some effort haha
Bro dont just put water on nether. Bro build an entire ocean on neather.😭🙏🔥
Pether Nortal ffs 🤣
How does anyone have enough patience for this
I don’t believe that you did that because you can’t make a Time Machine in Minecraft
1:54 poor cow 😭
15:05 bro did not say "then they"...💀
This feels like it shouldn't work, but it does, and it looks amazing!
Where is Paul
Least fake minecraft hardcore video:
I get tired from just watching
The nastalga ooulg the old sound of damage texture of lava and ice is crazy
Questionable ethics?.
Nobody's gonna talking about the amongus island hệ made😂
Truman show reference??? Y know the island... Heh hehe
I was once in the nether lands but it was not that kind of horror landscape as everyone depicts it
The pickaxe changed from fortune 3 silk touch 1 to a different order of enchantments and fortune 2 silk touch ( and no number)
The Time Machine should have sent you to debug world
I started loving you bc you're funny❤
Your the funniest Minecraft YouTuber I subbed
Pickaxes are cool
Where.  Is.   Your.    Diamonds
The fact that the silk touch fortune pick MULTIPLIES ORE BLOCKS is actually so funny and cool! That would honestly make for a really good high-tier modded enchantment: Fortuitous Touch
this never gets old
Mojang, this watched this
this is the most illegal video I have ever seen
Theres Ocean in the Nether before GTA 6
Face reveal
What is that? That looks like a sponge but void 1:00
16:00 This was funny
The most confusing part is, VILLAGERS CAN SLEEP IN THE NETHER BUT WE CANT?!?!
how and why
How did u transfer the nether from 1.2.5 to the modern world
You❤
Clickbat
I hate you bro you're the most worst YouTube I have ever watched  You have time machine this is not there  Well I hate you could you do some li you're literally the stupidest YouTube  I want you because I just want to see you face reveal 😭😭😭  Just please do a face reveal do a face reveal do a face reveal  Do a face reveal I'm going to cry
1:05 this just brought back memories of 10yr me “hacking” Minecraft to mess around with half bed items. Wow I have not thought about that in at least a decade.  Edit: who wants to go hunting for red dragon clues in 1.1? it’s totally real Notch is going to add it in 1.2
Bro built a whole ecosystem in minecraft hardcore💀
Us: You can place water in the nether  Kolanii: Hold my pickaxe...
Fire=flint & steal from temu
I havent finished the video yet, thats blue stained glass right? RIGHT?
No one noticing how he got grass block

Your wrong for doing this bro

Is this guy playing Mastercraft because the Netherrack and the lava looks like Mastercraft
How did you get the water in the nether?
This is weird how identical this is to your rare items video, especially the beginning it’s like word for word, and boring asf honestly getting them by traveling through updates 🥱

As said once my another Minecraft creator. “You can’t get water in the nether…unless your Kolanii” 😂

kolanii store didn't work can you help
I built the truman show for villagers in minecraft
It would be funny if he made his house of galvanized steel sqaure😂

hi 👋
My 4 year old son said that you're doing a good job
"I can breed villagers and then bring them to the island"
perfecto
I want you to name a SINGLE OTHER HUMAN that would go through the effort to do this.  Edit: 9 Months Later and no one can. I was right.

Bro, seriously do you think this video was worth making for the amount of time and hard work you put in for this video
17:13 bruh the height was 49 blocks! how do i know that? boats only break from a fall if the height is 49 blocks, not 48 or 50 or anything else
world download?
I used to do this when I was a kid. I thought i was so cool that I found a way to put water in the nether
You look like you need a day off my friend I love it!
why didnt you just place the tnt on the glowstone and just light it?
alternate video title: wait, thats illegal!
i feel so bad for all the grinding, but it pays off
How did he breee the chicken?

This is soo cursed
Hey man, out of all the MC YTers you are definitely the most creative, really enjoy watching your videos and I know the pain you go through for each build as when am building things I always like doing over the top big builds, but yeah your contents really good and how you edit, icing on the top. Keep it up.
16:06 He forgot that he was in the nether🗿
you should've put a conduit in XD
I think this is the first mc channel that is super good, but also super funny, I literally laughed out loud. Please don’t ever stop making videos
This... Big Big Big
I've for so long down there that there's been an ice age❄️
And it only spawns pigs because...  Logic🤠👍
with frost walker you can create frosted ice that you can push and pull with pistons and it melts as soon as it's moved essentially allowing you to move water and this works even in the nether
18:22 my power cut off immediately after you said "you shouldn't exist" as though you were saying my power shouldn't exist
He’s making the farm he says oh I don’t have water there’s literally a whole entire ocean
kelps
You could just get nether twisting vines in a snapshot of 1.16 and put a water bucket in order to get water in the nether
It's so real that I thought you rebuilt the ruins in the real ocean
Actually didnt know that Fortune and Silke Touch on same pickaxe arent possible because I somehow got both of them on a netherite picaxe
me waking up on the floor because someone stole my house in the night:
"I just stomped on a baby" is kolanii pro life?
why was there a cut before ur totem popped KOLAANI EXPOSED
*cutely transports your house to the nether*
18:22 thats what my dad say to me
did i hear the n word? 15:04
Anyone in 2024?
This is an insane amount of dedication
Hey Kollonii, this base SUCKS. You should build the walls as well, Netherakk as grass, soul sand as sand and basalt as stone. For the rest of the nether that's not your ocean, the pathways to there, just use concrete
bro sounds like dantdm
Bro face are fire💀💀
Isn't it impossible to pour water in the Nether? Or did he just 'put' the Nether into the Overworld?
The “how and why”😭
More of a lake, but close enough.
14:32 okay I just killed a baby
You can also just use /fill
got an ocean in the nether before GTA6
Pether nortal is top
I just had to say "that's not physically possible" in a british accent
You’re an insane person. Why did you do this?
mah brain hurt
I’m subed
5:05 that’s what she said 🤧
This is illegal
12:36   Am i the only one who thinks this looks like the falkland islands
So is it possible to start a raid in the nether?
we missed our good old   p e t h e r  n o r t a l  :-P
I was feeling good about my little pyramid/tomb in the desert surrounded by newly made farms in my normal survival world. Thank you for making me regret ever liking any build I've ever made
Wrong game bro😭🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Bruh just use that one snapshot that used glow lichen in lava source blocks.
what the fuck even happened
nether portals (the actual portal itself) is just reskinned glass that has an animation
My toxic trait is thinking I could recreate this 1:1
Breaking glowstone with a pick hurts me physically
Holy shit
watching this hurt me and I wasn't even the one doing this...
''You can not definitly put ocean in nether'' Kolanii: ''Or can you?'' -Puts an entire ocean in the nether-
If you place water, it will update the game to vaporize the water.
18:21 ''haha, You shouldn't exist''

I’m confused, did he cheat? He clearly had items which he didn’t have in his original hardcore world and unless he put them in chests, I doubt he had 64 beds in a stack.
ive watched this 3 times this year and im still obsessed with this nonsense of a video, Like an ocean???? IN THE NETHER!?? XD
POV:YouTube casually commenting in Kolanii’s vids Kolanii oh wait what yt is commenting on my vids ok
This was genuinely funny.
I feel like im the only one commenting in 2024
*pether nortal* I need one.
Now fill the end void with nether lava lakes.

Mojang finna put a bounty on mans head🏴‍☠
People who never saw a Minecraft vid and never played
This is so sick, you really went all out - and YouTube commented
I love the fact that kolanii puts so much effort into the videos
bro, I forgot how janky the boats were
I remember when netherrack used to look like that :')
Bro that coral reef was your Chance to get the blue axolotl 😐
If I would be in your place I would have   dug a single block and filled it with water.
You realize every part of this is fake?
"were gonna steal this farm" bro became Romanian and stole everything
I remember when I did project “green grass” basically it’s replacing all the grass (I was in the savanna biome) with moss to make it look greener
U know these utubers have more patience and creativity than i had my entire life
12:18 these big. Big. Big
I shudder at the amount of time this man has
ik I'm a  year late but you could have used tnt to blow up the glowstone
next quest is to make it look like an overworld instead of nether in the village

I think I had an epileptic seizure just looking at that house

You forgot to build trees!!!
bro just airdropped villagers lol
16:07 I love how that turned out.
This is the strangest thing I ever seen. I never thought I would see someone put water in the nether.
17:51 he said ocean monuments when he meant to add the tinier thingy magogs 🤣
Bro really took a fundamental minecraft rule and said ‘nuh uh.’ We love that about you Kolanii, never stop creating!
I left off on [4:24]
There are 152,874 glow stones don't ask how long it took me

This video is not only illegal for Minecraft from water in the nether (Not in Caldron), but also the silk touch 1 + fortune 2 pickaxe...
there's a water block which you can place in nether

69 missed calls from Mojang
The ghast is now my most hated mob😂
you will be fine "it wasn't"
Wow theres alot of them! Thers- you look like you need a day off, friend.
I actually wish there was a way to do this in vanilla. You know how there's the nether portals in the overworld that have spread some nether rack like they've corrupted it a bit? It'd be neat if you could do that in reverse, like you could make a nether portal spread overworld blocks into the nether and meticulously terraform an area over time kind of like how the skulk blocks work.
I subbed
"I've been down there so long, there's been a ice age" excuse me what?
whatever the ad revenue from this almost 10 million view vid is...  isnt even 0.000001% of what it would take for me to do all that shit  at a certain point, the lost time isnt worth all the money in the world
Time machine you're just pressing f6 and f7
evan though he dousent post that much his video are always funny unlike every other Minecraft youtuber
This is so cool to see in the latest version of Java, because when I was a kid I made an entire ocean in my xbox version of the Nether and moved in. Haha
I am going to piss you
Byeeee
Trash skin
I can bye that Time Machine for half off
You've heard of hell on earth but get ready for...

I feel bad for bro💀💀💀
Hardcore, Lan game, /creative.
im moving to the nether
One Word:CURSED 🤓
When the water started freezing over it reminded me of back in the day how everytime the game updated it started a ice age on old worlds.
villager farm💀💀💀
How did we get from “I SURVIVED 100 DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE” To “I TRY TO MAKE MOJANG SUFFER”

you can place bed on nether?
6:43 the phases are just so true 😂
bro u crazy
Honestly I dont even care if this isnt "real hardcore" I just watch him build cool stuff and make lame jokes
kolanii, this guy from brazil @Ligonz copied your video. You dont even need to understand portuguese from brazil to understand the video. he made the starting the same and instead of making an ocean in the nether, he just made a glass container, but the entire structure of the video is the same.
"And then were gonna pop one of those- oh wait I just killed a baby"
For 30 howrs
FBI OPEN UP
This is... bonkers. You're breaking my brain rn.
I remember doing this back in the day on Minecraft PS3 edition. It was pretty cool. Couldn't place water, but, if you broke the ice or let it melt it would make water. Pretty silly, they of course patched it though.
*17:53*  MESSI
"breed villagers and send them to the island"   sounds like your building epstine island 😂
I love your Videos 🎉
I remember back when we could put water in the nether that way, that really takes me back to the first server I played on where we had some builders who were terraforming the nether.
Cake doesn't give you any hunger
Not gonna lie this actually looks so cool having a beautiful village and animals in a nature place in the nether looks really nice lol
ryhgilrhgurhs

turn to Christ ❤😊😊
How did you do that! Water evaporated for me in the nether!
Islands dont float on water  That one 7 year old "😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮"
Make Epstein island
thats hella impressive :o
What mc hardcore mod do u use
I remember melting ice into water in the nether when Minecraft first released on the Xbox 360. Good times. Simple times.
man just imprisoned some dudes and forced them to start a colony in hell, this is the story of Australia
Imagine some dude just rocks up and forces you to live in hell.
This video gave me ocd
9:18 this is insane
The illegal pick axe with Silk Touch and Fortune is a paradox that just shouldn't happen. lol. Awesome.
I didn't understand a fucking thing out of this video
Make a pugland farm with them!!!
why spend 5 munites at the begining = money
I was playing the game when you could use iceblocks to make water in the Nether and turned my island in the nether into a green paradise on a multiplayer server. It was amazing and I miss it.
Imagine searching for a nether fortress and this is what you find in the middle of the nether
PND EORTAL
Bro has 3 k,s on his head ☠️
Bro have 38 hours a day
A few times I kept forgettting he was in the nether not the overworld
Please consider sharing this saved file! It is amazing!
What does the Bell do? How do you breed Squidwards? Why did the Bell make them turn around? How did you make them stay in the village after ringing the Bell?
that little riff at 17:15 is gorgeous
Love how he said we can’t place water in the farm. Erm…
stop killing the pigs
Did I comment on how awesome this video is or is it all the way down
13:45 "We can't place water." LOL
My guy really built an entire illegal *biome*.
Time machene!!
Thats too cool😅
i love the comedy
build a mob switch kolanii or just light the entire area up having all these pigmen underwater still looks annoying
I wish there was a way to know if this is legit, considering it takes all but 30 seconds to switch from Hardcore to Creative and back...
15:37 average game about pushing experience:
Ocean in the nether only a kolanii thing
I forget he isn’t in creative mode 😭😭
I think you did the impossible
Now you know how the guys at mojang feel whose job it is to individually make every single world
This is impressive but the title is REALLY off, a little island around some water isn't really an "ocean."
"I've been down there soo long there's been a ice age"
didn't even steal an ocean monument and guardians, is he even trying.
I forgot who god was, wait was he kolanii?
PETHER NORTAL WOOO
Do this with infinite flowing water
What's the point of hardcore mode if you cut out your deaths? Just be honest about it :)
Bro i appreciate it always raising the bar and setting new goles 😊
hours spent but if he dies...
You have 24 hours to delegate this before I call the fbi im ok with the illegal blocks but this is two far you have 24 hours řțþťŷűœpy
What’s the point of doing this in hardcore anymore?
Answering one year later, but you missed a golden opportunity to make your timer machine the TARDIS.
an ocean in the nether would look so surreal
Rip fingers

how long did that take
Bro just Terraformed the nether
Wouldnt it be easier to bring the nether to the overworld than the other way around?  But I guess thats part of the point
If a piglin saw that, what would they do?
5:13 prop its saitama and genos
im a nerd
and because it's the nether. whatever the updates.  these entities, villagers and animals, are stuck in eternal hell. G R E A T  J O B !
So.. how did you  place beds in the Nether?
Good video but super uncomfortable watching you put all that ice when if you remember how water works you can just put a long diagonal line of ice across the whole space and it'll fill in squarely you didn't have to place every single ice block😂
Bro sounded like Vsauce "Or Can You?"
You can waterlog glow lichen in the nether in a 1.17snapshot
E
kolani build a greenscreen in minecraft thats hilarious :,D
🤔
Kolanii how do you even make a Time Machine do u use a mod or something
I have no idea how the top few comments got more likes than the video but give the video some love
The fact that Kolanii now has the real possibility to *DROWN* in The Nether is hilarious.
i feel bad for him

The constant exasperation in your voice just makes me giggle. Makes me think you've got this internal monologue of "why? Why did I do this?"
As soon as he blew up the house i got an ad 😂
Kolanii theres a way to prevent the piglins from spawning just get on the roof and either u get there a lot of zombies and name tag them or get a lot of zombie villagers get 70 or 80 of them and it will prevent piglins because the mob cap is at maximum. I hope i helped!
It’s fake
A YouTuber did a best accomplish and putting an ocean and it was and it was you
3:38 put it in the hall
This is just absolutely insane. Something is seriously wrong with you.
Or you suold use ice In 1.19
My gosh now that's awesome 😄 I'm subbing 😁
Those old sponges triggered so much NOSTALGIA
All I gotta say is just…. no
Next video I turned the Nether into overland😂😂
Did you go so far back in time so you went to the ice age
Ah, yes. Elturel.
Nice
9:25 😂 9:59 14:49😳
good god.. Grian, stop possessing innocent youtubers, get out of this man!
love ur video but... LAS MALVINAS SON ARGENTINAS
Gentrification
So.. This isn't actually possible in normal updated Minecraft. Cool
18:39 best part of the video
How did the ghasts stop spawning at the end?
Why didn’t you use TNT for the glow stone?
I’m speechless
youtube is kinda ass now ngl bc the new anti adblocker shit so im just gonna stop using YouTube bc the ads were the most annoying thing
Hehe
My name is River
I might be wrong but couldn't you have put the water on the sides and it would've auto filled the rest and saved yourself from placing so much ice
make an entity crammer to stop the pigmen and piglins from spawning
But do you just switch versions while playing in your world?
There was an easier way to fill the space with water
Who would have thought it was possible to drown in water in the nether
This whole video was just a historical reenactment of how the British museum was founded
wow thats a really cool and difficult and time consuming task about an extremely specific thing! .... anyways have you ever been evaluated for autism or....

This video was fucking dope
Video idea: turn a chunk of your world upside down
This is one of the most impressive things I have ever seen someone do in Minecraft
Imagine one day the water somehow updates and the whole oceam goes up into smoke all at once
Bro really made a heaven inside of the hell
Did your finger hurt at the end Kolanii?
Why? Seems fake enough. And imagine giving your own message a heart 😴
Imagine your friend join and see somethng then they break in you cant go back to normal Minecraft
5:18 noting=redstone repeater
Islands that float on top of water are actually pretty common in lakes
Can someone explain what exactly did he do?? Like he went through older versions and everything got saved...?
This psychopathic levels of insane
Or can you?*vsauce music intensifies*
16:04 I AM DEAD 😂😂🤣🤣
So many things you could be doing with your life, and this is what you choose, well dayum...
you   couldve   used  tnt  to   break   the  glowstone because   water   does  not   allow  anything  else to   break
You can just sue the /fill command duh
kolanii is the only person who can break the fabric of space time for his viewers and still be sane
Where is the Fish
Laverotion
Rip sheep ☹️
man i havent played minecraft in so long i thought the breaking ice in nether to create water was still a thing?
bro you burnt my house down 0:05
u can combine enchants to make the pickaxe with:  Efficiency V Fortune III Silk Touch Unbreaking III Mending
Wait Kolanii! Didn’t you have placeable fire? So it self destructs after the ice melts.
water can't be in the nether
You got a world record for this.
Can raids happen in the Nether??
This looks way too damn good
Fbi will find you elier

green screen edit at the start made my day and its only the morning!
my only question is how many hours of your life went into this video? and actually i have another question  are you insane?!!????!!
Kolanii works to hard
Wait wouldn’t the chests have ice?

the dedication is insane!
I recall doing this a decade ago with my friends, we made a whole track in the nether, mined a bunch of ice to make water obstacles in the nether and race eachother on pigs with a stick. Then we went outside and the loser got someone kick a football against their ass.  Man, young teen life was intense
Imagine waking up to man just disassembling ur house 13:24

This guy sounds like dantdm
insane dedication man, earned a like :) it was cool seeing the speedcuts of you placing each block so we knew you werent just using commands
tell em to bring out the whole ocean!
Realy cool build 😄 did you consider having one of the lava colums that coms down from the sealing over the island to make it look like that was what made the island wn it hit the water
This feels.. illegal.
you are clearly cheating lol
your Patience is Massive bro
the best minecraft video ive seen in years
Your braincell count is going down rapidly You've made to much illegal shit
You put a straight through the middle, not a river.
I put water in the nether.
I don't even wanna know how long this video took to make^^

why do people not have regular skins these days only dream wannabe type skins
bro terraformed the nether insane scenes
TELL EM BRING OUT THE WHOLE OCEAN
Might be a case of parallel thinking but I feel as if this video is a combination of inspirations from Oddities of Old and German Peter's draining of the nether lava ocean videos.
Couldn't you have just made a 1 wide diagonal of full water blocks and had it fill the rest on its own ?
I got second hand exhaustion from watching this
13:27 The way blud woke up to his house in shatters
dude. the door sounds.
fun fact:if you waterlog something in the nether water won't disappear(waterlog it via debug stick)
please make commandblocks craftable and use that to set water blocks around nether (make it by using vanilla save config / nobody said that was a cheat :)) )
I would like to invest in the pether nortal
my man tera form hell
Water can't be put in nether lol fake
What is even going on
Islas malvinas
The lengths you're going through for a "water in the nether" joke
Since water instantly evaporates in the Nether I call BS.
2:01 Every 5 year olds first Minecraft house
terraformation
how do you use your 1x1 neither portal?
E
The striders are dead
Tell em to bring out the whole ocean
bro i dreamt about this type of stuff wayyy back in middle school, i was obsessed with terraforming the nether but never went further than placing grass and saplings and breaking ice lmao. this is really amazing work man, great job.
First vid of yours I’ve watched, Why do you have knockback 2 dirt?
Maybe i am the only one who thought that the over world map that he built is much more lool like vice city map if u look clear fully
You lost 612 points on an illegal item XD
How do you come up with these ideas they’re incredible and the best part you have the patience to do them all.😊
what of an abormination of a house is this?
I remember building chainmail out of fire
Why
Bro is destroing Minecraft
Not going to lie, a portal window looks insane. Great video by the way!
Unfortunately, the  boat not working wasn't a bug or a sign of the world breaking, boats were really just that terrible in early versions
having him spend all this time on it joking about stuff while slowly going insane is crazy
Color me impressed 🎉❤😂
Tell them to bring out the whole ocean
Hey look YouTube.             I’m going to connection terminal him.
BRO IS ACTUALLY INSANE
I forgot this thing existed 7:33
should have made a wall so Piglins cant get in and Villagers cant get out
kolanii is the josh from lets game it out of minecraft
i cant think straight with all these oinks🤣
Wow! None of that looked fun!
get every item in the game.
this is insane
hell of a vacation spot
Kolanii talking about the last section is like Camman talking about the rarest block in Minecraft
Amazing content as always
Tell em to bring out the whole ocean joke here
Omggggggg
Would a conduit work in the nether? 🧐
You need not do the entire lake covered in ice, you just need to do the essential cross covering the main distance.
Red stone dust that’s white 🤣
Him: *builds entire ocean in nether* Me: *dies from a creeper bc there were no sheep in the cherry biome so I couldn’t make a bed* (Java would be easier but I only have bedrock 😢)
Ladies and gentlemen! You are experiencing the one time in history when frost walker may have had an actual use! Incredible!
This hardcore world is so illegal 😂
I love the Time Machine! It brings me back to when I watched Stampy when I was young 😊
"okay i just killed a baby" 💀
I'll come back when someone tries to do this in pocket edition.
Thumbs up if you like kolani 👍👍
Pov: you accidentally add to the mincraft lore
Villagers can casually sleep on a bomb in the nether😂💀
Kolanii making an ocean in the nether👍 Kolanii placing water for a farm👎
How do you go back without you’re world deleting?
Place some kelp.
This comment will blow up
What version of Minecraft did you start in?
The corners of the enchanting table bookshelves layout matter!
THE TORTURE STARTING AT 6:00- 8:30 minutes is absolutley hilarious.
Nice
Is there a world download?
You could've just done a diagonal line of water and then used kelp to extend it to the bottom of the ocean, where it would spread as infinite sources and fill the whole space.
ohin mincraft
Jesus christ planted those trees my hand and split the mountains for them 5:12
The Best part was when he got a fortune 2 slik touch pickaxe
Bed in the nether?
Damn Kolanii is such a hard worker. Thousands of hours into building things!  The time machine
My favor part I’m gonna steal this reef
Why dose this man not have a world download or am I not looking in the right places?
hi
This man is a menace to society.
why?
I was about to say when he said “Time to add some monuments” YOU ARE NOT GONNA ADD A BLOODY OCEAN MONUMENT TO THE NETHER
im so confused and surprised that the time machine work when it was nearly the entire thing just broken
Add a monument
Bro said you look like you need the day off
Ahh yes stealing reefs all in a day's work 💀
Respect to him being at 1 and a half hearts and didn't react.
He missed an opportunity to add a little end island floating in his ocean in the nether
I mean he literally made it to the far lands how lucky he is ?
I remember when you were just a small channel
大家好，球，我喜歡球。 BALLS
“It will be fine” “it wasn’t” -Kolanii
Kolanii say “Oh wait we can’t place water” standing next to an ocean.
suffering
yo whats wrong with that lava pillar 8:21
bring in the whole ocean‼️‼️
Mf really stole an ocean, can't have shit in java...
but now you dont have the 1.16 nether generation
You can break glow stone quite fast with a hoe
This is a display of immense power!
This man has The Fittest placing finger
Bro's gonna be a grandpa someday.
i love illegal things
I have a question? How can you place water in the nether?
I have a question?
This video is the equivalent of humans building a mars base in 2250
I seriously hope for your own sanity that you just removed the glowstone blocks using world edit
sea pickels are the best item in the game
i know you will never see this but you should place gravel and clay around the island to make it more textured
Yet another person that doesn't understand that glowstone is not mined with a pickaxe, it doesn't have any tool that makes it break faster.
7:55 me when shortcuts
why is no one mentioning the beds in the nether
Imagine if he built a dome over it that is a fake sky💀
you just wasted time because you could use tnt🤓
I love your video but this is the most cursed and think I've ever watched lol I remember my first time watching this always so good confused I do not know what was happening
This is hardcore stuff is getting out of control
12:01
Sleeping villagers in the nether😮 normal😅
The unemployed friend on a monday afternoon
Aw man... it hurts to see him leave behind the cursed fire and water instead of taking it for his museum
build a peaceful mode machine in nether and overworld
ins anan g3b3r1r
Ah yes, the trypophobia room. Why are the old sponges so terrifying?
FBI: 🙂💔
Nice time machine
Kolanii doing this reminds me of the British museum... jokes aside absolutely love the effort and looks ✨️
By abusing time travel and magic he has reintroduced biodiversity into the nether.
the warmest ocean
Bro commited Global Colding
wait till he realizes that he couldve just upgraded his version to melt the ice instead of placing thousands of glow stone
NotherWerld
wait did he just downgrade his entire world?
17:11 had me dead on the floor 😂
I am inspired by your videos and i want to do this myself
YOUTUBE IS THAT YOU!?!?!
bro why you speak like wheatley
16:06 you got me bust out laughing so hard hahahahaahah
You you should put tortoise 🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
9:25
That should be illegal 😂
17:10😂
Plz Do it
Put the other illegal items in your main world
This... maybe one of the best video about minecraft i've ever seen
Your placing finger? 🍑
So many people have done these I'm not surprised when they turn up in my feed anymore. Make a tundra in the Nether. Then I'll watch.
4:57 are you absolutely british.
This guy is on the mojang's hit list
Upnext 100 days on nether
Such a leagend
I wanna try this types of challenges in Hardcore, but i'm on Bedrock and well... apparently it's impossible to add ONE singular gamemode despite having Spectator??
02:03 grain wants your location and your liver 💀💀💀
Thats not possible 💀
So I haven’t played mc in a while but is how he got the water in the nether because he loaded his world on an older update where he could get water in the nether and then reloaded the world on the most updated patch and then started adding detail?
How did you access  1.6 test build 3?
What is the name of the version 1.6 test build 3 in snapshot?
Okay, you just make me laugh with the pig things hahaha
Gaming bacon.exe has stopped working (when I saw the pickaxe)
Dude almost died 😅
I’m surprised Poseidon, didn’t get mad when he stole the coral reef
this is so cool
The fact that minecraft world generation breaks when changing versions gave me an interesting idea for a mechanic in a game.  In this game the protagonist is trapped in a matrix and to fulfill certain objectives you must change between versions of this matrix and take advantage of bugs to pass through blocked parts of the map, pass through places where certain enemies do not exist in certain versions, the possibilities are endless.  If someone makes a game like this, I would love to play.
Doesn’t the island look like a Amongus?
Matthew he way he noted
We need a world download
this is cursed, but in a cool way
That's weird ,I was Thinking of this video yesterday night for some reson date:17/7/2023
I in pain rn please help
Very warm ocean
even the microrganisms in the ocean transformed into fishes in the nether
I’m eating strawberry’s while watching this
This is a man of sheer will. Cheers mate.
why did the thumbnail change
An ocean? Water? Nether? Wut?
Maybe I'm missing something but... isn't that supposed to be impossible? And I don't mean water in the Nether, obviously. I mean going back to a way older version of Minecraft without completely destroying your world, or being able to keep your inventory from one world to another, and even moving terrain from one world to the other. Because at least two of those things are necessary to accomplish what he did.  To do that, he needed to generate a new world in a beta version, then do all the "water in nether" stuff and afterwards convert to a newer version again. But in order to bring all these forbidden things into his actual world where he has all his stuff, he had to somehow transfer terrain and inventory from one world to the other which clearly isn't supposed to be possible. So... how? Is this all a skit or are there ways to do all that which I don't know about?
couldnt you have used frost walker at any point necessary? ie breaking the glowstone
One of the best hardcore episode that I ever watched
I really miss old cursed minecraft, having fire, water or lava in your inventory, i miss the good ol days
“I only have one word” NO
13:52 wait is it possible to grow with a bee nest??
you are such a good builder
wow!
Hey try making a mob switch it will stop all the pigman from spawning
This man is certified insane wtf. Bro built a biome by hand

Are you alright
malvinas argentinas
12:18 Ah yes the infamous big big... big
2b2t aahh build 😂
people: playging minecraft isnt a real job Kolanii: **just spend X amount of days on his videos* people: D: .. i guess i will be back in my office tomorrow ...yeah
Genuinely so impressive dude what the heck lmao
It was still good tho
The video was dark on my screen
😮
...
Make it on YouTube kids
yo what about the torches?
THE HORSESSS
rip kolanii's mental health
I was wondering why you couldn't place the ice diagonally, and abuse the water-filling logic to make it fill
''ocean'' there's lakes bigger than that
I've been playing Minecraft for 13 years now (since Infdev in 2010), but until this Video I didn't know you could create bonemeal sand underwater to create seaweed, what the heck
epic
bro just un-nether'd the nether💀
Everything in this video feels illegal and I love it
Your asleep good idea 💣
This dude just broke the whole minecraft logic
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂:-)
i love you went you suffer
What's the first music called? Having a hard time finding that it's been a yr🙃
bro wtf
8:38
Bruh one of the last family friendly youtubers-
Minecraft: “water in the nether? Impossible!” Every single Hardcore minecrafter: “impossible? Nothing is impossible.”
ah old minecraft. back then villagers were different and the nether was different. well a lot of difference, you could make a all Protection armor
You could also do that in one of the snapshots for 1.17  (21w03a to be specific)
What
"One sec" then casually eating the floor 😂 2:18
this awe-inspiring but there one question I need answered; if you replaced your nether then what happened to your nether hub that you put like 8 hours into?
"Oh no i killed a baby" bruh
17:58 I actually thought he was in an ocean in the overworld
what version did he downgrade to?
BRO THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT LIKE 20 HOURS !!! 😮😮😮😮
I love the old netherack look
16:06 was a unexpected jump scare, needless to say, I was Shook!
Dude... The amount of weird stuff happening... Can't PROCESS IT
Wait...That's illegal.
Guess you could call the cake floor … a cakewalk 🤪
I feel so bad for you but it's so wierd and cool
me imagining what are the feelings of his fingers rn:  💀💀💀
why
How do you have the patience to do this 😂  I could never do this
bro almost died
How did his world not get corrupted? I suppose it's edited
Bro has no life.😮😮
When you stop playing minecraft pls give us your minecraft world
Illegal 😅
Bad work bro bad work look 17:51 Look there is a floating lava
Back in 2012, Minecraft players probably wouldn't be even able to conceive how to do something like this. The Minecraft community has truly come far.
U sound like slogoman (josh)
Terraforming hell itself has got to be one of the most alpha moves possible
Imagine waking up and going outside to see the sun and you realize your village teleported to hell literally
3:16 so relatable
“Like ok, I just killed a baby.”
ruined portals are actually made of blackstone in the nether, so you should probably change it to that instead!
You know there was exp particles 😂
‏‪14:38‬‏  "Uh no I completely disagree with that"  After seeing an innocent egg
The boat wasn't actually the world failing, boats really were just that awful back then ;-;
To put frickin water in the nether use a cauldren
Programming a mod would have been faster.
There is nothing that can distract me from the ocean in the Nether and it's island village.
BABY TURTLE MURDERER!
12:40 this just sounds so funny to me.
you should put a conduit down there
open oors get ignored by monsta. place sidew ays
11:46 fucking floored me, just everything about the response
2:23 🤨
12:28 bro I would be freaking out in this situation how are you so calm
This is awesome! 😮❤
You should make a water temple in the neather
12:38 the pinnacle of yoink
This is not what I was looking for...it's so much better
Why?
11:15 SUS
This looks very wrong
13:52 you know, there has to be another way to be able to place water in the nether...
Heh a pether nortal
mf got a merch store when i stopped watching for 2 years bro
i don't understand how minecraft "survival" content obviously made in creative is interesting to this many people, meanwhile real legit players doing insane things having 10 viewers, you people are weird
...... Getting a comment from youtubes official account is crazy
Kolanii, you didn’t need to place the entire ocean manually, you should’ve just used the water source flow mechanic to automatically fill it
Imagine someone just comes along and relocates you to hell.
why and how
Never had this much fun watching Minecraft videos, I respect your dedication. The content is amazing, congrats!
God this was so fucking unwatchable! Just get to the fucking point!
Got an id for the penultimate bit of music near the end?
Seeing water like that in the nether looks so wrong
Amazing
Still better than bedrock
in creative you can do /fill then put your coördinates and then put water and voila you have water i the nether
There's a Bedrock resource pack where you're able to get fire blocks (and water blocks without bucket) quite legally as a part of some loot tables.
Nice casual near death experience.
you really should have use icewalk boots to break the lamps xD
5:24 chinese censorship
Bro either doesn't know about automation or refuses to do it
How have you not gone insane
this is deadass noah's ark
btw some island do float on the water
This was cursed. 🗿🌮👁️👁️
Come on you need sheep where are the villagers going to get wool from
You literally made the Bad Place
How did we place the beds in the nether🤔🤔🤔🤔
0:00 WAIT REALLY?!??!
nice
But why not brake it he sand in tnt
The amount of dedication it's just wow
Can I download this world?
Guys. Every time I start a new world, I ALWAYS get a blue axlolotl when I'm mining. What is this luck man
Your video just confuze me
Speaking of islands where is old sealand
fun fact for everyone: yk frostwalker? the ice it makes is an actual item you can get through commands, and when it melts in the nether it turns into water. on it's own. technically cheating, but works for the current version
Love how, during the time adding water, you give up on placing sand and went with straight ice... Only to cover it all with sand then build an island anyway.
6:46. WHOOOORE
Damn, the red stone dust got Chinese censored.
this is very underrated
very cool
Anytime someone goes to the old version of mc, when you get back to the new one, it starts looking like the old one's textures
My man just send a lot of villagers to Hell '-'
When you upgraded your world to beta 1.9 pre-release 4, the game now thought the beach was a snowy biome, so it froze the water and put snow everywhere.
Minecraft isn’t a sandbox game anymore. The Devs are regulating all gun related mods and server games involving any “adult weapons”
Could you have just put fire on the ice or am I dumb ?
vi 20 minutos de un video que no entendia nada y aun asi fue entretenido
Me watches one minecraft video by accident.... Youtube recommendations we minecraft now
The big big big are not looking very nice are they
now put a lava ocean in the overworld
this video should be called minecraft but i want to die
foreign
3:27 isnt possible, enchants dont reset when taking an item out of the enchantment table and putting them back in. You actually have to enchant if you want to change the enchants.
blep blep
bet you CANT GET THIS ITEM WITHOUT CHEATS / SWITCHING DATA sigh.......................... The Debug Stick
17:11
FISH ADD FISH (he did)
I don't burn village?
I love that you tricked yourself @13:45 It’s very convincing. At one point I snickered thinking “he’s going to drown in the nether”
every word he said maid  me 🤣🤣
it's feel like moving entire dimension to other dimension
12:25 he almost lost his whole progress and was totally chill about that
The thumbnail is cursed 💀
Combine the 2 cursed pickaxe in an anvil so you have the ultimate cursed pickaxe
Oh my goodness, when I clicked on this video I was just expecting a body of water in the Nether with maybe an island and that's it. I did NOT expect you to go sooo much further by populating everything with life including a Village. This would've been impressive in CREATIVE, I can't imagine the amount of time and dedication to do this in Hardcore. Hats off to you truly
You forgot tropical fish!
sent those villagers straight to hell
Kolanii's relationship with the nether is the same as Elon's with Mars
17:12 lol I'm laughing with tears xD
this feels illegal, I love it :)
This hits different after watching mcyums latest video
Ok i sub you because you funny
this should be world record 😂
how does thetime machine work
i love how the Villager just woke up to see as house gone😂
Ssssssssssuuuuuuuuuussssssssss
The walls also hurted me at Minecraft SkyBlock cubecraft
The fish in the nether be like: hmm it’s a little bit hotter than usual
just go in a 1.17 snapshot(idk the version) where glow lickens if placed in lava make water(even in the nether) and sorry for the bad english
I remember at least in earlier versions silk touch and fortune do get together, and it happens a lot, which was kinda annoying when I was playing on 1.6.4 and prob1.7.2 servers.
This is the minecraft equivalent of when Elon musk built a giant underground tunnel because he got sick of traffic.
you are a monster
I wish lava in nether worked like water on the overworld, changing colors between biomes
Wait, that's illegal.
Did you hear about the Minecraft youtuber who claimed to put an entire ocean in the Nether in Hardcore mode? Well, I guess you could say they really made a splash...in the wrong dimension! Now they have to deal with fiery fish and lava-filled dolphins!
16:07 CLIPPED https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxUj4nu26rGIf-JnaFk-srdp9k3TqtR1B7
you actually make the impossible to possible in minecraft. btw just using tnt when brea king the glowstones.
Everyday I wish I could place water in the Nether. Every day.
this guy have no enemies
"I love seeing my world breaking"  it wasnt your worlf that was broken, it was the boat  Boats were completely broken and useless until 1.9
Elon musk trying to colonize mars (colorised)
That was an absurd amount of work but it was awesome
Quote Of The Day "I just killed a baby"
if the nether was real and someone found a way to get water into it. People would jump into the water to cool off because the nether is probably really hot and then the water would be boiling hot, not ideal
Your videos always entertain me!❤😊
Why does no one question the water in the nether????
If you said to me "Oh no, this just generated like that in the nether" I would of believed it.
Ah yes. the greatest soundproof bedroom with a nether portal that we can only use cause we can’t fit a normal person Everyone needs to make a nether portal like that. There is no such human being can be this creative like this I’ve ever seen in the earth
Put some dolphins in jt
I think stuff like this in minecraft is so cool i used to have a world with a bunch of illegal duplicated blokcs that id make cool stuff with i kade a giant underground world with end portal blocks as a roof to make it look like a cool stary sky but that world along with almost every one of my previous worlds got corrupted i hate console minecraft ive found that its inevitable that my workd will get corrupted snd its made me stray away from playing
time to make nether colonisation a thing
Kolanii is definitely from Detroit, he was trained to take everything
Viewer Discretion: A lot were harmed while making this video
Respect for the EPIC FLOATING kolannii who puts so much work for us, the days it takes to edit these videos himself (i dont know)
12:38 Heist Music 🎵 Were gonna steal a reef 🪸 The whole thing 😎
Using torches would have been much better. They break themselves when the ice beneath becomes water. Glowstone needs to be broken manually.
For the pether nortal,you should've used your portals from the chests.
imagine going to sleep one day after a long day of farming and you wake up to see that your house has been abducted with you and your bed being the only thing remaining  "cant have shit in this town"
Amdatakaaaaam
Dude terraformed the Nether IN HARDCORE I wouldn't even have the patience for this in creative mode
Can we appreciate that he blinks in every video?
humanity terraforming venus in the year 2400 :
Pees of crap I know your cheetng!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can know u go in crative mode hackin g in items!!!!!!! evry dam day!!!!!!!!
3:46 holy shit that is over powered. I see why they don't allow that.
Yes they are, Kolanii. The undercover cactuses are pricking you to death. 2:58
*SMASH*
He saw Despicable Me and decided that stealing buildings and landmarks is a normal thing to do with a greater purpose
this is how lewis from the yogscast should've lived in the screw the nether music video
should have used torches
You could rename this after a historical event in american history
the determination is crazy bro
you could have gone to a 1.17 snapshot where you could put water in the nether with lava and glow lichen
“james may goes to hell”
Bro almost lost his world at 16:04
2:16 this house gives “day in the life of a true brexit geezer” vibes
Why is he so scared of baby piglins?
bro sounding like dan tdn
it’s an ether ortal 12:02
12:01 2b2t moment
I need more hoodies bu the store link isnt working, how sad
The pure dedication of this man
This amount of effort is insane and I love it

You could also now have a raid in the nether
Just a peaceful normal day in Ohio 😂😂😂😂
13:27 flat packing a house
This video is pure chaos and I love it. So glad you popped up in my recommendeds 😂
Omg this is so nostalgic! It always terrified me as a kid. 2:45
If this doesn’t look exactly like the thumbnail im leaking your address
8:02    TORCHES KOLANII! they would break on there own i think too
I truly enjoyed the comedy in this video. Made me forget my life problems for a bit thank you.
11:00
Terraforming 101.
why not upload ur world?
Steve is just holding 64 water, what's wrong?
This is insane. Next episode you should get gaurdians and dolphins and turtles in your ocean if you are up to all that work
I think you should have only covered a third of it in coril

Yay Kolanii video. *loud knocking* FBI OPEN UP

This is a cool idea also literally every mob "WHAT HAVE I DONE TO GO TO HELL!?!?"
I was looking for a comment saying what I was thinking but I couldn't find one so...    Why does he look like cucurucho (if yk yk)
U could just use Lava nd Glow Lichen in 1.17 snapshot 21w03a
Just add some ocean monuments 😮
An advert popped up as he exploded his house I genuinely thought that his pc had just gone haywire

Fun fact frost walker will help you
he could have used tnt for the glowstone                                                                                                    /

Next video:- I brought a gta gun to minecraft using nether portal
Can you make a video watching ml3doesstuff
whats the music at 12:21
Wow I just love the “ “ block its amazing
I love this idea of this utterly bizarre little space of peace and harmony in the middle of literally hell. Glittering water, lush grass and a quaint village. It'd be even better with a dark twist
How did you make the “time machine” work? I want to do this in my world
Which Minecraft Version do you use ?
How on earth do you have any sanity left.
Amazing!!
Kolanii - Dolphin In The Nether
It would have been better if you did it in the warped biome
Oney kolanii fans say no all the time
Lol?
Thats not fisicly posible🤓😎
16:06 I did too and it was the funniest thing ever
I love this
Nether oasis
how do you go back in the same world and play on different versions
How did you place beds on the nether?
Casually builds an ocean with an island and a coral reef and have a village with villagers IN THE NETHER        ( *THIS IS INSANE BRO* )
I can't find a single reason not to use tnt on the glowstone.
redstone cum?!
I love you
Are you ok
I only discovered you today but you are soooo funny I love ur vid ima binge watch them!
Get the ice In the chest
This is the perfect example of "hardcore players looking for reason to play after killing dragon"
this is a super funny and creative way to do the “I built (incredible thing) in hardcore minecraft!” genre
Why is this garbage in my suggested videos? Doing it in "Hardcore"? What's the point if you're using cheats.
vro is terraforming the nether
Torches work better than glowstone as they will disappear when the block the are placed on melts
I only sub when I can see me watching every video. Good job. Subbed
Bro is the Gru of minecraft
18:15
bro really did this for our entertainment.what a good man
Jesus loves you bro
what the fuck is hapening
how did you change versions without your game getting corproted
12:51 I don't believe you
what music you use at 10.19 i wants it
I read the title and said HOW?!
Watching these videos out of order and I nearly shat myself at the surprise knockback 2 dirt
Would it be possible to get a world download for this? You did such an amazing job that I'd like to mess around in it myself sometime just for fun.
just turn off mob greifing and your doors are fine
Its like a cursed meme video cuz you made a house out of every block in minecraft
video summary: man uses time machine multiple times (even when half blown up), suffers through placing ice and glowstone for hours and then brings a ton of people to an ocean in hell noahs arc style
Damn I remember ou as old damage
Old zombie pig man’s
You know that you can move water logged roots in the Nether right? I meant for water to your farm :)
That is a really cool village
15:38 got me.
0:00 to 18:46 is cursed
Hey, look at the villagers, they are sleeping in the nether My friend: let's try it Me: 💀
how does coral even thrive in the nether...Oh my god its because notch and them didnt expect water to be in the nether sooo XD
Instead  of letting the Nether have lava he turned it into water
He's a pro builder!
Kolanii can I ask u a question: r u ever gonna complete ever advancement in the game?
how do you get that much "Grass blocks" in survival
16:05 That had no business being that funny 💀
This guy will do everything to break the game
He said absolutely massive 10 times in a sentence
I wonder why hardcore players build So Fricken Much in hardcore, 1 life only
bruh, how much minecraft laws did this man break? XD
Amazing video 🎉
the best part of this video was the what i call the ‘fishing for cod and eating it out of context’ scene.
Kolanii: That's not physicaly possible :D
Casually gets water in nether
POV: you just watched this entire episode on TikTok
POV: you just watched this entire episode on TikTok
POV: you just watched this entire episode on TikTok
14:33
Unbelieveable how much time and effort you put in those videos. Just crazy 😊
Love ur time machine bro 👌
U have no life XDDD
How do you only have 1mil subs
Imagine playing with your friend in your world and then he will be like: "wth?"
I do not think i would ever make an ocean in the nether
This is the best intro ever😂
can we get a download of this world pass
You forget the silktoch with fortune
i want download your world bro
can everybody agree that we don't care if he took stuf from those chest
why is the music so good?
I read his title and said what so I clicked.
i love your videos but where is the next episode
Kolanii: I hate the ocean. Also Kolanii: let's build a ocean!
I never got attacked by a ghast ever 👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
Oral reaf in oHio
A little slice of Heaven in a little corner of Hell.
what brings you to do this sort of stuff of taking structures and placing them somewhere else?
one time i put villagers in the nether, built them a nice cabin and farm.    put beds for looks....turns out them mofos are suicidal
what's the song at 16:26?
Just wanna day, you can place the doors sideways and then the values of open/closed are inverted, so they can never be broken down
now put the nether in the ocean
Kolanii hear me out you should have grabbed stuff from the nether and make a giant fake nether
Nice. Now do it in the end.
are we gonna ignore that he pirated minecraft beta 1.6 test build 3 :skull: it says unlicensed copy
wait is this the rehten
why. why was the ending as funny as it was, THAT HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE MY LAUGH!
So I guess there in a really warm ocean get cause he's in the nether
Everyone knows that 4sea pickle is better than a torch
666:10 can just u
Creative Hardcore?  ..cute 👎
https://youtu.be/NAerKlKkoPs
i remember commenting on something when you were at like 80k and you replied :)
the amount of time he puts into these videos is legit insane, its a block game and he does this much.
there used to be a gltich with the wither to get the end portal teleport block it was fun to make stuff with the void look super rare to have in collection
Or did you put the nether above an ocean 🤔 makes more Minecraft sense
BABAGURL
I PUT THE ENITE OCEAN IN UR MOM
tHIS GUYS HUMOR ...
this is hard to watch
Kolanni. Why?
You just earned urself a sub and this is my first watching you now imma recommend u to my friends u freed me of my absolute BOREDOM
look at 18:14 bro got every single impossible items, yet he just got tactical fishing.
How would u get the version where it spawns chest whennloading in?
THIS IS SO COOL!!!
2:02 everyday normal house in Ohio
If they didn’t make the nether different from the overworld, this would’ve been way easier I’m just saying
What wonderful videos glad I subscribed
Least masochistic hardcore Minecraft player
this is the most painful thing ive ever seen... R.I.P ur brain cells
might as well put a lava ocean in the overworld
BRUH YOUTUBE HERE 💀
Can we talk about how he found a way to put water in the place that should not have water?
I wonder what happened to this world
bro got too much patience
If you are new here,You are probably asking who is this guy,this is the most entertaining YouTuber.kolani don't stop uploading!! Best ytber
if u did that in bedrock edition the water would be red!
Please make a download file for the world lmfao
He just turned hell in to heaven
So when YOU time travel, you're fine  But when I do it..
U can’t place water in the nether
hi everyone!
You should've used a tardis to go back in time
The time thing hurts my brain
Roughly 300,000 blocks of sand? I've placed 200,000 blocks on my new video, but wow. I cannot imagine how braindead you would be had you chosen to fill the lava up. I'm already questioning my existence. lol.
9:25 what was that
tobuscus wouldn’t’ve struggled like you did
it takes him so long to make these vids give a round of aplause
To get a lusher green on your island use moss blocks and azalea leaves
Whats the seed of your main world? It looks super cool
How You cant put water there?
couldn't u just place torches , when the ice melts the torches will break
Cooooooooool!
I'm impressed with your hard work
Kolianii is the king of comedic narration prove me wrong
How is this physically possible?
The 3.7M people that didn't leave a like on this video are criminals
the random spawning ghost is like a running gag
I remember feeling like a giga brain doing this in 2012 (13?)
wow, heart??
Ocean in nether is mind blowing, and almost impossible, your video was amazing
Me when I saw the thumbnail: Okay let's put you in jail
Play on bedrock, and in survival, found an efficiency 1 leather helmet
A turtle egg on top of a trapdoor???
16:20 ,,,,  by far the best moment of my day,,,😂😂😂😂 the poor iron golem looks wrecked...
Ocean in hell? Must be nice!
how are the beds not exploding when you breed the villager in the nether?
this is so cool!!! frostwalker wouldve gone a long way in breaking the glowstone
Can someone explain to me how he put beds in the nether?
That was some grueling entertainment. ✨👌
"oh wait I have an entire stack of cakes" hadme wheezing. I am inthe stage of tired where everything is funny
He sounds like DanTDM lol!
This is the fakest shit I’ve ever seen
18:13: Kolanii has made the achievement [Tactical Fishing]
how do u get pig spawners ?
0:01 I don't beleive you
He sounds like Dan tdm
5:28 my head hurts😮
0:13 pig got hime EXPOSE HIM
New kama land fr
The fact that animals can spawn in there if grass but he still takes them to the nether
16:04 this part made me laugh so hard when he clicked accidentally
It looks so wrong
i love the fact that kolanii shouldn't be allowed to play minecraft for the things he's done
Man I forgot that the silver bit on the chest use to be just another 2D texture instead of 3D
Plot twist: he built an entire nether around an ocean and never showed it
"You see, you can place water in the nether" *ad plays*
The edits and sheer amount of time for this vid is amazing
this is not ken carson
lol that plug for merch was pretty funny
I died at the "nod if you're scared" :DD
Alot of hard work was put in. You gotta respect that😃
Where is the dolphin?
bro sounds like dantdm in his old videos. if you remember dr. Trayaurus you are still a legend in my heart.
This makes my brain hurt
ohio 💀
Minecraft but nothing makes sense
Minecraft but I colonize hell and create a civilization.
Me too seriously
WTF?! What version is this?!
When you go to the Nether in Ohio:
this video made me wish minecraft never removed the ability to put water in the nether. something about the hellish landscape with the cool tropical setting is just so weirdly cozy and nice to me.
If the ocean creates water by connecting sorce blocks but the ocean is in the nether what happens if you put a sponge in the ocean
2:02 every house a 10 yr old made in prime mincraf
This dude keeps nearly dying
did he just colonise the nether
Insane absolutely. I would love to see skyscrapers in a nether city too
Why why do you do this to yourself
The Ocean is made from kolanni's tears when he regret his life choices from spending hours And hours on his videos
I don't know what's more impressive , the fact he can do this stuff in the first place or the fact he had the patience to do it
The tone change at 11:45 💀 "yeah like that, that looks nice- ... how and why?"
Now it's good
Did you notice your grass is not becoming alive it is dying
Two reasons why I stopped watching. 1) The video was just too hyper. 2) The concept of how to fill the nether with water was just too far removed from vanilla minecraft. Not everything has to be vanilla, but this was just too much not vanilla.
Kolanii: Ok were gonna add some Ocean Monuments  Kolanii:Procceds to add Ocean Ruins
This is definitely the most cursed minecraft world ever
I guess that can be called a warm ocean biome. Or just global warming.
I left youtube open for 3 hours and now i have seen this vid without conext, my brain hurts
You should get illegal armour (all protection enchants) SB737 got it
You should add the fire item to your collection
notch: excuse me?
18:37 I love it
Amazing 18:31  just wooooooow 🤯 I have never seen anything so wrong
BRO WHO AKSED LOZER CLOWN IDIOT 🤣🤣💀
"Oh shit I wasn't recorded"
You guys should check this out it's the smp I play on with my friends a bunch of content creators
When you think about it, any game is a sandbox game if you break it enough
Thanos building a minecraft house: 1:59
When he said ocean monument i thought hes gonna STEAL a ocean monument
6:30 finally a rapper who doesn’t mumble
ow is perfect
Hi, I got to this video by Tonigon
U got commitment issues mate
The islands kind of look like a ying yang
Bro i clicked the vid expecting it to be some weird glitch but this literally should be illegal lol...imma follow rq
The details and structures, it's a masterpiece.
Beautiful
You should try getting a command block
you should've added the fire, lava, and water items to your museum so you could have water as an item on an item frame...
"Welcome Back To Let's Game It Out"
bro
I feel bad for this guy, he did it without world edit and was very commited to doing this, I would've given up in the first 20 minutes.
We all should take a minute  and respect how much time he spends on these videos
YOU SOUND LIKE SEBASTIAN SALLOW FROM HOGWARTS LEGACY your British accent is so similar to his omg
If i were u i would bring some fire home
A what? 0:28
did this channel die or smth
bro were is you          need content
POSTTTTTT
:OOO
Doesn’t an axe break glowstone faster than a pickaxe?
At this point in time 12:04 this is called a nortal phether
Sheeeeeeees can u make the end the nether (☞ ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)☞
This is so illegal
people have too much time in their hands
This video is like a Minecraft fever dream
Fbi! open up!
You can break bedrock in 3 ways
How you place bed ??
ngl i been off minecraft content for abit but this video made me laugh alot :)
Can you upload rhis map woud be nice
Say it with me now that’s not physically possible
my brain swizzles when he break the glow stones. It must also be excruciating for him
Kolanii it has been 3 months upload already....
This man is the illegal king
You should meet acookiegod some time, search him up.
As an OG player of minecraft, I salute.
When is the next video ?
you take the meaning of "no lifer" to the next level
smash like boiiiiiiiiz :)
"Okay I just killed a baby"
They should have water for the nether but it doesn't put the fire out
My guy could have just built a house but he really stole the village 💀
16:05
Kolanii a while ago: im going to go back in time to grab items from previous minecraft updates. Kolanii now: LETS FILL UP THE GOD DAMN NETHER WITH WATER AHAHHAHAHAHA!   No offence for your videos tho
15:14 "villgers" ah yes gramer
ok
Illegal 🚫 Okay
I'm really loving this new genre of Minecraft video where everything is possible through time travel.
Tim Stoker??? From The Magnus Archives????
NEW TITLE FOR THIS VID: MAKING AN OCEAN IN THE NETHER AND BRING INNOCENT VILLAGERS TO HELL
Gane stalkers be suspicious AF!
You play just like me. I should do YouTube so I can collaborate with people like you. I’ve just never took it seriously like I do Minecraft 😂
Bro ur a terraforming god
DAMN THAT PIG SPEAKING ENGLISH OR SOMETHING 16:58
( / ° _ ° ) / _|___|_ ??? Nether ? Water??
Actually, you can use the placable fire in those cheats to craft chainmail armour.  (I think; I haven't tested it out in the current release.)
just so creative. Wow
please pin me im a big fan
That was so much funnier than I thought it would be. LOL
U sound like noahsnoah
Who is still waiting for minecraft one block 200-300 days?
I question your sanity
this is what minecraft means when it tells you to get creative, love this video so much
I also don’t like the big big big…
idk how many of you guys noticed him saying his middle finger hurts 💀💀7:31
Bro the fact he hasn’t posted in 3 months means the man has something BIG in the works   Or he’s just lazy 🤷🏾‍♂️
The villagers rejected the village because they need doors, they won’t recognize the building if it doesn’t have doors
I’m sorry but we’re so you find all the time to do this м ?
The Pether Nortal 😂😂😂😂
I didn't know oak spawned bees in the nether
next video idea:getting every achivement in minecraft(also making an army of cats)
Kolani is dead?
am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

Wheatley from portal time travels to colonize hell.
Good video
I would have built a dome over the lake to make it look like some teriforming project
Why does no YouTuber say in the description what music they use?? Also what's the music?
i like how he was 1,2 seconds away from losing all the hours he put on the world
The amount of time he puts in these videos 😃 THANKS  kolanii! Ur the best 🙃
Ayo kolanii I would love to see the 300 days you said you would make for the 1 block sky block, but you can take your time because I have no idea what video you are planning to do next
This guy has the perfect amount of British accent.
Kolanii why don’t you post as much as you used to
bro is insane
Very creative, i must admit
its not hardcore unless you start from scratch
just found your channel, you're hilarious!
anyone notice how he put down beds in the nether?
Btw because the way kelp works you could theoreticly flood the entire nether from a single water source block.
[wow]
Bro the nether and the overworld crossout  at least its nice it makes it alive and a crossout dimension
Bro “pethernortal”
Theoretically, this lake would be a boiling lake due to the lake of lava beneath it.
This is the kinda stuff I find at 2am, thanks YouTube
👁️ 👄 👁️
You can use mangrove roots to move water from your ocean and onto  your village's well. Simply place the root on the water to waterlog it, then use pistons to move it around, then break the roots at the desired location and the water should flow out normally from it.
Hmm, you are insane. Really.    That's a compliment actually.
my god the dedication of this man is incredible
how does your hardcore world not break doing this? going back and forth between updates?
“You know what’s not looking so nice, these big, big, big.”- Kolanii 2023
I liked this video just for how clean that merch plug was
If u do /fill it will fill the nether with water
This man deserves so many more subs this is insane
New Video when?
Bro playing minecraft in Ohio
Bro thats ilegal💀💀💀
“islands don’t float on water”
UPLOAD!!!
Is just like overworld
You can terraform venus with ur power
First the chicken attacked you now the sponge walls what next air???
Scientists: Lets Terraform Mars!  Kolanii: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm nah lets terraform ThE NEthEr
I can't believe what I have seen... in terms of the compression factor of your effort
Ez find a ocean in overworld then fill it like a nether
Are you rich?
i forgot i wasnt watcing dantdm
Epic
I’m not joking YouTube is actually un subbing me from ppl
Fuck at 18:00 I thought he was in a real ocean for a second instead of a nether ocean
Vendo esses videos da pra perceber que todos os videos br são copias kk.
If in this update you get every item why didn’t you just go into that server in your last video ?
Water
Now imagine you die.
Awesome videos, recently I found u, 16:25 😂the sound and the view.
W music
I love how he just nods at the start
you shouldve put kelp all over so all the water becomes full blocks
I love how people have been trying to put water in the nether when they could have just built the nether in the over world and the put the water... Why?
I like how Kolanii, rivals Technoblade's insanity and humour man
I think it’s time I’m in dire need of a kolanii vid
It’s been 2 months come back please
How did u but bed’s in nether
I wish this was actually possible to do
"One sec"  precedes to eat floor. "Anyways."
Which version did you play on that had all the items in the chest?  Edit: And how do you get that version?
HOW DID HE GET SILK TOUCH & FORTUNE
3:09
3:07
That red stone dust looks like the sugar my dad puts up his nose.
Gamers react stole the thumbnail
What is a ”Pheter notal”?😂
I MISSSSS YOUUUUU
𝕋ℍ𝕚𝕤 𝕚𝕤 𝕤𝕠 𝕓𝕣𝕠𝕜𝕖𝕟 𝕨𝕙𝕒𝕥
Love the editing in the ocean decorating part!!
This man makes the impossible possible
16:24 where we droppin boys
Kolanii! thx for the idea for stealing the village, so i made a vid just shoplifting an entire biome
Stop, just stop
How do you make the time machine!!???
he sounds like he's so tired of everything
thats so much pain
17:12 honestly this made me laugh because of the sound effect
2:01 this is the most cursed and most weird house I have seen but your videos are amazing!
16:05
Do that fake 100’000 days in hardcore Minecraft series it was so funny 😂
Can you get the efficiency leather helmet.
13:36 that man’s house just animorphed into a bridge
15:33 one missed click and it blows up
Bro has no job to do this
broh i remeber when you has like a thousand subscribers, way to evolve broh, keep it up
13:29 the look on the villager's face says everything.
haha the intro was funny, poor pig tho it got abused D:
can you make more videos pls I love your content
I have another way to prevent them from breaking your doors. Place the doors so that when they are closed, the door is technically open, and vise versa
Villiagers *sleeping* in beds in the *nether:*
just wow
Netherlands
this part killed me idk why 💀 16:06
When mobs blink he’s going to have a hard time stealing stuff.
Hey kolanii. Uve inspired me to download minecraft but im curious which one do u use? Java or bedrock bc id like to buy the one u have. Thanks
Thank you man, you keep minecraft youtube alive
Make a RAID in the nether vilage
I think I’m having a stroke watching that house tour.
Cool video! I love ur content <3]
Yo that’s illegally bro 😳😳
Sorry i can't get over the fact that the thumbnail looks similar to stampycat's and the arrow is barely missing the dolphin
we'll steal stuff from old world steal xp from pigs steal the ocean steal a reef steal an island steal a village
Fishing in the nether looks so wrong
When is his next video coming out?
i really hate gases especially in old version since if you see them they shot u instqntly
0:19  missed opportunity for vsauce music
this is almost an anti-clickbait title. The title and thumbnail are waaay less interesting than the actual video. good job?
Sadly he didnt put any fish and dolphins in the new ocean

fuckers stole the entire village cant have shit in Minecraft
this dude is legitimately crazy
Bros working on a banger vid I can feel it
He hasn’t uploaded this year (no pun)
As good as this video is, I found it hard to enjoy because I got 4 midroll ads in less than ten minutes of video. Idk if that was done manually or if YouTube did that, I just wanted to mention it in case YouTube was the one who did it, cause I know they did that to quite a few other creators.
tbh im supirsed that you didnt get carple tunel from this
You should build a nether around an ocean too
make a giant hexagon(can be anything but it has to be a hexagon) or i unfollow
I love that he has to do it  but I don’t
Kolanii are u alive??
my man makes the impossible possible
do you know how hard it is to find someone with a nice voice like yours to watch minecraft?
Where is this dude I love his content
They need Jobs to accept a village
he must have the buffest placing and breaking fingers
This is so cool but so illegal
MAKE A NER VID
MAKE A NEW VID
MAKE A NER VID!!!!!
OYE, IM KOLLANNNIII AN' I'm BRI'ISH WAWAWAWA
the only problem I have with this channel is that he doesnt upload enough. each video is amazing tho
Quality
Could've used torches instead of glowstone and they would break automatically when ice melts
we love jo \
so there silk touch 32767
silk touch 1 wtf
He should have put a gate on the nether portal so the villagers can’t escape.
''I've been down there so long there's been an ice age'' -me leaving the house after christmas holidays
Wouldn't using Kelp be faster than actually using so much ice for this one? Like, you could just make a little bit of water sources and then hop on the newer version and use kelp to create water sources that would then expand more and more until it's all full. It wouldn't be as trouble-some because kelp is literally one hit break and will destroy the kelp above it.  Too bad I was late to this and nobody will see it and you waster your time doing this. Oh well
I never thought I would laugh at a minecraft video
PetherNortal
the bed is like ohio🤨😂😂
We need our fix. It’s been 2 months. I know your next upload will be awesome but Come on man……..
People who subject themselves to this torture are so incomprehensible they kinda feel like pain-inhibited aliens... ...Hey, wait a minute. I bet they'd love Hypixel Skyblock
very impressive! Is it possible to add some dolphins too? Or can you not get them through a portal?
Birdb
masterpiece
I wonder if it would be less effort to make a fake nether cavern around a village in the overworld? Cause it would look the same 😂
I need you to link that nether for people to download lol
KOLANII COME BAAACK :(((
That piglin tho...
Kolanii where you at my GUY
Kolanii next video when man? I love them
You could've blown the lightstone blocks above ocean by tnt cause tnt does not harm water, lol. Anyways, great video! Found your channel just recently!
Cool video as always
Is there anyway you could upload this world so other people could play on it? I think it’s a really cool concept
By the fact we haven’t had a vid in the last couple months I’m hoping it’s a build up to something
I just want know how much time you take to finish 🤣
10:42 thats a drowned. In the nether.  WHŸYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
First, you could have just made a "small ocean", instead of a large lava replacement.  Second, as to, "where did all the ghasts come from": You got rid of the light sources, turning all that obsidian/sand into valid spawn locations.
Can't wait to see you're next video man, i love your videos
Me: he's not going to steal an entire reef. 10 seconds later...  R   E   E   F
Some people go to insane extents just for a minecraft video and I love it
Man this youtuber steal your video #adal
Omg soooooo good but how aren't your hands hurting?!?!???
Okay so new videos should come out soon, i guess, i hope!  Idk if u need ideas, but i would love to see u tackle some modded minecraft. Either Better minecraft, All the mods or those Fantasy one :D Could be fun, might not be ur cup of tea tho, so just tossing the idea here!  See u soon Kolanii
13:23 POV- you fell asleep first at the sleepover but consentual
i love you kolanii
Your one sub closer to 2 million
I saw a axe in his inventory when he got back
other youtubers: I played a game of hide and seek against minecrafts best seekers kolanii: [snorts powder sugar] I JUST PUT AN OCEAN IN THE NETHER
You dont Need pickaxe to break glow stone blocks you break it with the hand
16:21 "you look like you need a day off my friend"
Wow
im sure in the chests were command blocks LOL id use them
Good heavens
Why did be spend so long getting silk touch when there would of just been ice in the chests then just duplicate the ice???
wow...the amount of effort and time put into these vids makes my job look like homework smh
That classic Minecraft part was so good. I love it.
What... how.
2:22 why do sponges look like cookie blocks!?
It’s no longer a hardcore world, it’s just a illegal and cursed world
Can you survive the void in hardcore if not your scared hahahahahahaha
I swear to my mc chicken nuggs  I NEED 😈 another video NOW😤
WHY
The title should be called LIVING HELL (MINECRAFT VERSION)
Make more videos I’m sad you don’t 😢
This whole video feels SO illegal.
R u able 5o catch a zombie pig man not a zombie piglin maybe for ur museum
I’m still waiting for those damn chickens  You know what I’m talking about
is this guy gonna come back?
I don't want all this effort to be in vain, but at the same time I don't want to support this level of masochism.
omg time machine is real!1!1!1!1!1
*"Minecraft Nether logic let the chat"*
normal day in ohio
Can we download the save?
I saw the thumbnail and expected it to be clickbait, but you actually built an ENTIRE small OCEAN. Like, BY HAND.
Turn To Jesus Christ ✝️🙏
nah your commentary and edits are actually funny .
Guess you could have used tnt to break the glow stone
Coooool
my son really love to watch this
my son really love this games
he literally makes mistakes
why you have index same voice?
alternate title : stealing the overworld
Does somebody know how to transfer a Nether Region from the Beta 1.6 test build 3 to the latest release?
This is extremely interesting and entertaining minecraft content. This is coming from someone who enjoys the game, but hates youtube minecraft content.   This just showed up in my recommendations and it seemed interesting, and I genuinely love it. Great channel. Great content!
You colonized a dimension in minecraft
15:32 beds in nether?!
i mean, ok. this isnt live minecraft so i dont exactly appreciate the vid lol. your time machine is what, a place for you to sttand so you can change the version of the game? why nott just include the version of the game in the title. this is bunk lol
This is absolutely beautiful. A lively ocean in a lit up cave is already amazing, but the contrast to the Nether's color scheme and all the fire/lava makes it just serene. Awesome work
I thought the last video was cursed, But this takes cursed to a whole new level.
"I'm stuck, yeahhhh" :)
Didnt peaceful exist in 1.2.5?
Damn this guy only had 19 videos and already has almost 2mil. He broke the algorithm
The coom dust though.
Ok
1:42 My theory is, the water freezing over is due to the update where they added biomes, and that update affected old generated chunks. Causing some oak biomes to act like snowy biomes and vice versa.
Kolanii don’t you get tired of placing EVERY SINGLE BLOCK I think that it’s amazing but dang that’s Impressive Ty for the content😁😁
11:15 among us?
I spoke to God and he said there be some witchcraft Tom fuckery goin on here
good luck
“I did a little building off camera”
5:24 nah that's conducive Crack mate
how to get the secret versions of Minecraft?
That is literally Loot Lake from Fortnite
The flying skills at the end of the video omg.
How did he make his world harcore at the beginning if it dint exsitst
Tonigon?
Lol so great I watch it so much u are funny
How does he switch minecraft versions on the same world without corrupting it?
HEY KOLANI, I HAVE A WARNING!! A guy named "Doğukan Adal [tvo]" is a content thief. He copyed your "I Collected Every Illegal Item In Minecraft Hardcore" video. I have proof this b!+c# only changed the thumbnail and content is same. Also he is a lazy a$$ that only gets 3 item or smt. This dont matters anyway his video name is "İllegal Minecraft Eşyalarını Topluyorum (Minecraft Hardcore 21)" Pls blow this up for he see that i hate that doğukan adal tvo b!+c#. I wish he get banned from YouTube have a good day 👇
16:19 You look like you need a day off my friend, dude 😂😂 You got me dying inside.
You sound so much like Noahsnoah
I thought this video was gonna be funny but it's sad like I feel so bad
turn from your sinful ways before it’s to late Jesus loves you and so do I God bless✝️❤️
for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you or forsake  you” (Deuteronomy 31:6).✝️❤️
I hope you get some good Ad revenue. Must've taken forever
Anyone know his upload scedule?
you could've just used tnt for the glowstone
Yo Kolanii, about your video where you collected illegal items, theres more illegal items like netherite stairs, "a very fine item" and "footprint" that can all be exclusively found in the easter egg snapshot with infinite dimensions. Before you even concider doing it you should probably try and see if it corrupts your world, but theres my idea if you ever wanna try to get those :D
Damn thats impressive
Holy shit what
Kolanii nod if your scared pig “nods”
that white redstone got the chinese censorship treatment
I've been wondering if a villager breeder would work in the nether. Now I gotta try making one, last one I made on mushroom continent worked but then it didn't. A village on Island in Ocean in the nether is impossible and this video is crazy but it works. I'm curious if the villager can actually sleep in the nether without blowing up now.
kolanii, try and get netherite stairs, that will be very cool.
bro one minecraft world i got a ruined portal a village and a outpost right mext to eachother
mojang after seeing this:👀 bro we gotta stop this man
The Waffle house has found its new host
Hi, so I was planning on making a video similar to this one, if this comment some how reaches you I would like permission to do the video.
The waffle house has found it's new host
Plzz do a 300 day skyblock video plzzz
6:50 I caught that "iniciate" lol
17:51 Kolanii:were gonna add some more "OCEAN MONUMENTS"...  Also Kolanii:*Add ocean ruins👁️👄👁️*<--my reaction
sooo....Is this possible in Java current version
But like actually imagine a whole different portal leading to a aquatic type of world
everyone else playing checkers and Kolanii is playing 4d chess
when the new vid kolanii *SMOLDERING INTENSIONS*
This is kinda how I imagine it would be for humans to try to populate mars
You forgot to put a broken ship in th sea
12:04 like that sound xdd
The waffle house has found its new host
Please make more videos I love them and I am subscribed
ah yes one dot two dot five.. best
kolanii makes is so good at making me want to play minecraft
1.6 was a great time
Ohio minecraft occurrence 💀
He works hard on these vids and I respect that ! Y’all have a great sun or night
I like how he did everything in the thumbnail legit except the dolphin. Those things are impossible to keep alive, or move anywhere
I've made water lakes in the nether on servers using worldedit lol
you should have called that broken portal a mether snortal
I never thought this was possible 😮
Best so far...hilarious ending!
Pether nortal 👌
If you could sleep there then that would be cursed over load.
yes tipical minecraft
We have to appreciate the pain he goes through to entertain us🫢
kolanii:minecraft is a sandbox game... me: .........................................................................
6:43 break lava? I don't think that's what u meant
But like how

He accomplished every man’s dream, And also broke the law of Minecraft physics.
u are crazy big man
Petition to remove ghasts from MC
Can we see it with shaders?
Kolanii is one of the funniest people on YouTube. His editing is so good. Definitely a personal inspiration!!
bro there's no one island with a river in the middle, its two islands xD
This is the first time i watch this man video but this really desever a sub
Why didn’t you bring fire as an illegal item and put it in your museum
Next up. I put the Nether in the middle of the ocean
The most underrated Minecraft YouTuber
How tf you do that??
Gosh I don’t even think I could ever do that much all in one episode 😮🎉
16:05 imagine losing your hardcore world like that 🤣🤣
Kolanii u should do a world tour
Am I the only one who can't hear anything
Are you ever gonna make a world download
You should do a video with sandiction
So beautiful!!!
you've heard of lukewarm ocean, now get ready for hotwarm ocean:
How was he able to go to past updates and come back to his world being unchanged
Is F.B.I calling you now?
Gru might have stolen the moon but Kolanii stole an entire coral reef
I just love watching your videos and then I think of the hell you have to go through just doing it I cry looking at it
I think you could have avoided having to break all those glowstones if you used torches instead, cause they would break as the ice under them melted...
Damnn that so ilegal
the kamikaze sfx HAHAHAHAHHA
wait how the hell they put water
😂😂I loved this
I was wondering that if you could replace the reverse nether portal made out of wool in your mirror with just a default nether portal would be so cool.
Maybe try placing a conduit to kill off all the piglins
when your so bored you break the laws of physics
love your content so much if i could colab with anyone probably be you. but thats dreaming big ive got a ways to go first
Blink ones if you don't want me too the villager 👁️👄👁️
you can get water with glow lichen now unless they already patched it
wow
when are you going to post a new video
i want watter in the nether
Mojang LITRARLY SPENDS YEARS OF WORK just to make sure that’s there’s no water in the neather kolanii: laws of physics prepared to be broken
Mate this was a great idea and a great video, your humour while transporting the livestock to the Island had me in stitches. Amazing video Amazing Humour 10/10👍🏻
Bro pulled out the pether nortal💀💀💀
YOO can you please do a one block 300 days??
nice
6:16 nether roof is flashing
Ever thought of placing tnt on the glowstones? Dumb
It looks a bit messi
Kolnii does hard work for us
14:49 help a demon!
Holy crud this guy is so fast at building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNtfKuRpwZo. Go to 1:21
This videos humor is so funny
This was one of the best videos i've ever watched!
If only Yogscast knew that moving to the nether could be this luxurious
put kelp in the warter, the lack of kelp bothers me
i need the uno reverse card thats amazing
No shot bro said “I’ve been gone so long and Iva age happened.”
you could blow up the glowstone
More videos plss 🥺
Officer? Yes, this one. This is the man that put water into nether
I actually have a naturally spawning illegal item in my current update mc world.  I found an *efficiency 1 leather cap* in a woodland mansion.
Ive been waiting for a year that you make hardcore world
Give us your world !
Try terraforming the nether
I feel threatened
You did everything so good I get confused which is which
Wow this is purely amazing!
GLORY GLORY GREAT KOLANII
16:05 such a funny mistake, cant stop rewinding
"Just accept it, there's no escaping this place... right? .. hehe... right? " cracked me 😂😂😂

u can setblock water in the nether and /fill
e edit:thx for the likes and dislikes
your insane edit:yes intentional spellig erorr
This feels illegal to watch
In an alternate universe, they probably get more than 1 kolanii upload per 2 months..  One more reason ours suck
Life in HELL!
When I saw the thumbnail  My brother: oh he's gotta be hacking  Me: no Kolanii can do anything
You can melt ice with a torch in the nether
One big hard work of glow stone your  destroying it
you sound like DanTDM
you psychopath :o
just one thing       how you put the bed in the nether? wich is an new version right?   ignore me. im just stupid
You seem like the person that'd change the direction of the flow of rivers, if there was flowing water in Minecraft.
On one hand I'm like "Oh, look, what cool stuff you can do in Minecraft!". On the other hand I've spent like 12h straight, just removing bedrock from a hole the other day, so to imagine, how much time it'd take me to do all this... I'm scared.
AYYY THE TIME MACHINES BACK
He said he would build a island not 2 islands. 11:36 11:36
When I clicked on this video, I just expected a mod, but you delivered way more than I expected. Great video, mate!
kolanii:  lets tidy it up a bit Also kolanii: puts ruins in the water
Now he youst has to make the nether as the nether base😂😂
I AM SHOCKED!!! HOW?!!
One question : How long did it take to do everything ?
Next episode: i slept on a bed in the nether in minecraft hardcore
A youtuber named Thete did this too
This Is What The Fill Command Does Behind The Scenes When You Fill The Nether To Water
Imagine just stumbling upon this island in a random nether world
Couldn't he have just placed the ice on the borders of the ocean instead of covering it? The water sources in the middle should then fill up automatically. Or did water spread work differently in that version?
that looks awesome!!
mom i want minecraft overworld at home. mom: we have minecraft overworld at home the minecraft overworld at home:
Wait wait how can you get water in the nether it's impossible mine craft dose not say you can do that you will get banned!?
I feel like he could have used Frost walker for breaking all the glowstone when he was done, would have saved time if it worked
you should try 100 days in minecraft skyfactory
Bro next you should add a nether portal in you end
dang I never thought you'd like my Tweet on Twitter
Great, but wheres the ocean monument?
To a person who does not play minecraft this video seems normal
All that effort and all you had to do was build the nether around an ocean in the overworld
Wait, that's illegal
That amount of nostalgia i got from this video... good old days 🥲
You could just have gone back to 1.17 but I guess that's ok
J’ai l’impression de regarder rick sanchez jouer a minecraft 😂
Me struggling on  far future day 28 you builds and entire ocean in the nether
wart 17:12 the sheep turned into a pig????
16:06 im dead 💀
You just broke the game- I RESPECT THAT.
Hey make your real life house
What the fu is this shi
romania simulator
Phase 1: break lava Phase 2: place sand for 5 hours Phase 3: regret life choices Phase 4: place ice for 7 hours (not really because he found out that glow stones can actually melt ice) Phase 5: Break Ice Phase 6: Regret life choices (AGAIN) Phase 7: make ocean with tears (wait what, that’s not even possible because if you make an ocean with tears your entire water supply would be zero, which causes you to have LETHAL DEHYDRATION or even death) Phase 8: regret life choices (FOR THE THIRD TIME)
At one point I thought that the nether ocean was the real ocean.
Can you send us your broken world? ;D
*pethernortal  -Kolani 2022*

2:03 Cant even play build a Minecraft house in ohio
The green screen joke was priceless
8:42 me talking about marvel
I don't know how you do this Kolanii .
You could have actually used sea weed to make the water full blocks instead and making infinite water sources
Kolanii i command you to collect the fire, portal block, water, lava and half bed
You should put a glass bowl over it with holes for the river to stop ghasts from destroying stuff
why dident i get the notification for this
You're a comedic legend. But good job on the nether ocean
Spend 100 days in the nether
Operation grief the reef
I woud like it to be 100 days with wardem on hardcore
Happy new year kolanii even though is a bit to late but yeah👁️👄👁️ happy new year and be safe and also touch grass sometimes
Kinda love those half doors.
B R U H
nice
Kolanii:im gonna steal an reef  My mind:hes going detroitmode
Ik I'm a month late but.... 'We can't place water, ah' he says building an O C E A N
8:25 the unholy slippin slide
18 minutes for an uh idk how much hour work
If I remember, there was bug in like 1.17 that allowed to get water in the Nether by using Lava and Glow Lichen to convert it into water.
Why does the world always break so much? First the chicken attacking him, then the walls attacking him…
Kolanii in your next video dig out a 250x250 hole with the breaking bedrock glitch and recreate the end but in the overworld
just started watching you and already liked the content, you remind me of boffy and I hope you continue this type of content!
when are u uploading a new video 😢
There was a snapshot when they added glow lichen where if you placed glow lichen in lava you could turn it into water and then spread it by using kelp and bone meal, I did that in a world, it was fun but maybe not as tedious as what you did
300 days Skyblock?
The patience this guy has physically hurts my brain
Gonna steal this ->
16:34 Fortnite be like:
I am rating this ocean an 8.6 out of 10. It would be a 10 out of 10 only if he added ocean creatures and custom mobs. Though I really like this guy's dedication.
Pls post more 🙏🙏🙏
You should make like a slow paced, walkthrough of the final area, just exploring it and showing it off, this is something really unique in minecraft and I feel like we saw so little of the final area and its cool as hell
I love how you could have stopped at just the water but you didn’t and actually made it look epic
how long did it take you to edit this
Hey Kolanii   These videos are great can you make more?
Imagine chilling at home then you suddenly get relocated to hell
Legend has it, you can get a Diamond Sword from a Villager in the Nether.

i love how the fished thing was made by the science test. props to him
This is cursed but beautiful
I don’t know if I should be afraid or impressed
How 😮😮😮
Okay but wouldn't After the water updates wouldn't it just evaporate
you could used frost walker to break all the glowstone because the ice blocks from frostwalker are temporary😂
Insanely cool
Wait wait wait, you really got a silk touch and fortune pick and didn’t see what diamond ores would drop if you broke it 🤦‍♂️
well that's just... insane. i have no words
I hate the fact that this works, you could prob sell this world for like one million because of all the illegal things you’ve done in it
Lets think of how much time was put into this masterpiece
Is it just me or is there something a bit sus about the white skin and the ks on his head, or is this a hilarious accident
On number 7 of the phases... Bro I do that too much🙃
imagine if he right clicked the beds in the th nether 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠
Pls use shaders again
idk what’s happening here(i really have no idea what the point of this video is) but i like it
you know? pretty accurate on mojang's part to make time traveling be something that most surely corrupts your world in unimaginable ways that you cant expect i guess if you'd time travel on real life to make a collection of illegal, supossedly not-possibly existant objects, things would break apart pretty fast... in ways we wouldnt even be able to comprehend i bet.  nice realism, pretty immersive! gud game
2:02 normal base in ohio
Just imagine being sleeping and sudenly a guy comes and steal your freaking home lmao
jesus loves you
hi pls upload more videos so i can binge watch, i love your videos a lot a lot but i am an impatient person, thank you
Only in Ohio 😂💀🤓
"You can take the Nether out of the Ocean, but you can't take the Ocean out of the Nether."  -You, probably.
'Pether Nortal' had me dying holy shit that's a really good joke.
He Should Have Took the Half Beds Fire Lava Portal Blocks And Water Blocks and crop blocks To His World in a Illegal Museum +
His accent is the perfect mix of English and American, and I’m here for it.
I would steal this idea if it wasn´t so tedious
Would it have been faster if he had broken the glowstone with TNT or some beds?
how did his world not corrupt?? i accidentally logged on my world in 1.8.9 and the rest is history
Why would you do this to yourself Impressive builds though. So much effort
Not many MOBS in Prerelease 4 (me think)
Wait oh
Enderman ded
So I didn't know that bee hives can just randomly spawn in trees from bonemeal, I thought it was  natural world generation, also it looks so weird seeing the entire build in the nether
Lovely project.
Question! Did Ice Walker break the water on the newer versions? Because if not you could've use it to break the glowstone more easily
imagine in his next episode he dies and all this work goes to waste
well thank you for wasting your time for our enertanminte
WHY aren’t u uploading?
Fear the man who fishes in the nether.

12:19 "These big big big" very wise words  Quote is spoken by Kolanii
im scared of what kolanii is working on now
You retarded or what
why are you do this thing
Starting to think do you go outside kolani
The risk
imagine being a friend of him in the world, entering the nether and seeing a village
Nice LAKE you got there  Yeah get called out  (Sorry I'm horrible this is amazing truly)
this is so cool
Personally the true cherry on top for the videos is the random sound effects cuz I’m a sucker for shitposting
I subed because of the pain this guy had to go through
this. is. not. normal.
16:05 Alright good id- *blows up an entire family that was just trying to sleep*
You have a lot of time, patience and motivation, I could never! 😭
Imagine just waking up and your house is gone. Only in Detroit bro 😂
I really like phases 3,6 and 8.  Very relatable!
You wasted a lot of time in your life when you could do other stuff but he did this to entertain us
Your voice is calming Imma sleep to it, update in the morning
You should make a section for glitched portals
wait that's illegal
how tf is this a add☠
I honestly watch Kolaniis videos regularly just because I love his voice.  It’s so calming I always fall asleep when I am struggling with it.  Thank you man! Your the best
Wait, that’s illegal
Kolanii in 2030: "I put the entire world in the nether"
Did he just start talking about a vid i just wached ?😐
He stole the whole reef
You can also just use glow lecin.(idk how to spell it)
Perfect                                                                                                                             👇
He evens kills the cow and realizes he had a stack of cakes 🤣🤣
The time machine I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣
The constant ghast spawns lmao
You should try to make a massive villager trading hall in the island on your nether ocean. It would be cool to see in the next episode.
How does this guy not have 10 mil
Holy shit.   You … you literally _terraformed the Nether._
Honestly I actually love the editing of this, makes series like this much more bingeable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRz_MFH2yA
Tererria.
°-°
The dirt placement at 11:41 is immaculate
@Kolanii it would be cool if you tried the wither storm mod for a video
17:25 not lattitute but altittute
He is the definition of mad lad
Villagers are the only creatures that can sleep in the Nether and not die
Build a house
Last episode *Definetly a keyboard* *Obviasly a mouse*
There are 2 water items, flowing water and still water, if he used the flowing water item, it would work normally like a bucket, but can be placed in the nether, so a lot of this hassle wouldn't be needed.
This video hurts my brain
The bed explosion scene was priceless
Wait he is using green screen in minecraft ??
So sad i dont have minecraft
K the fbi is gonna be watching this one LOL
Best vid ❤
I got this as an ad. Very nice!
Ok but now put an entire nether into the ocean
When your Minecraft crush she'll date you 'When the nether freezes over' so you one up her, by freezing and then melting the nether.
You could make 1,000 ender portals using update exploits
still waiting for 300 days of one block god damn it
man i love ur videos so much lmao ur editing style is so fire, and ur funny af
This was fake, cuz the only water u can pt in the nether is cauldron water
Fbi open up you are arested for breake minecraft rules
i did
Next vid he is probly going to put a enderdragon in the Nether….For fun😅
Watched a couple of ur vids and relized ur the 100k days guy lol
Water in Ohio?
How did u get this version i mean the beta 1.6 test build 3
kolaani come back bro
😊
Me be like
Why are there so many generic Minecraft YouTubers that do hardcore.. they all have the same bland skin and annoying personality with over the top sound effects
The zombie pig is literally grian in season 7
ADD THIS IN THE ILLEGAL MUSIUM
Technically it’s not an ocean because the ice is from a lake so you just made a giant lake
Can you upload more frequently?
Your insane for doing this. I love it.
Would a conduit have worked in the nether?
Why do you torcher yourself like this?
This guy needs to be added to hermitcraft!
You gonna hate me but what about using some blue blocks to cover the entire top blocks in nether to imitate sky? With some "clouds" I guess... Ikr this will be really hard to do
the effort you put into these videos never fails to amaze me!
bro you did the ocean in the nether so well when you were transitioning to the overworld and the nether building and collecting stuff i thought you were only on the nether placing corals, sand ect great job
I haven't watched Kolanii in so long, I just got a recc on my front page and I remembered that I liked this channel, checked how many videos I've missed... 3, I've missed 3 uploads in that time
Insane
I like how he doesn't bring the water and fire blocks
Loved this video 18:42
by the way its in 1.14
You should get god armor with every protetion
Kolonii skip the totorial get command block in survival
2:05 most normal minrcraft base in ohio:                 is the meme overused idk.
Architect of your own pain
And I am a fan
Can u make this 👍emoji in next pls 🙏 ty
can you grow carrots there ?
Kolani is the legend!
You could sell your world download and never work a again
How do you place beds in the nether without them exploding
He finally upload after 2 months
You know I was thinking you could’ve tnt the glow stone on top of the ocean which would’ve been way faster for you.
Went we got attacked when trying to sleep in old updates we used to call it having nightmares, ah memories
My man breaks the law’s of Minecraft logic and Physics
It's honestly amazing how much effort people put into their Hardcore worlds.
This is not remotely ethical.
Replace grass with moss block and it will look more green, better and full of life in the hell dimension of nether.
Couldn't you get rid of the glowy stuff with tnt? It won't destroy the ocean, but will break the stuff faster. Thought a ghast COULD light up the TNT...
Cool!
MAN
what if you go to the village with bad omen
amaIZNG
Bro this video is hilarious
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus you will be saved I love yall
Man’s didn’t even use the old piston sand dupers to auto fill the lava ocean - what a hack!
What the f-ck
I got this video as an ad lol
One time I was making a villager farm in the Nether, I right-clicked to place a bed, the game spammed the right-click because of lag as usual and everything exploded.  It wasn't even _my_ mistake, I just placed a bed, and the lag said NO. That was extra infuriating.
/respect
9:06  the world is not breaking, boat mechanics just suck astronomically before update aquatic
Hurmmmmm, if all the water in the ocean comes from a thin one-block-thick layer at the surface, that means only the surface will have water source blocks, everything below will be downwards-flowing water, which means hellish to swim upwards.  Pretty fitting for a hell ocean actually. I'd normally hate this in the Overworld.
why do you need to remove all the lava? just place water over it, make a water ocean with an obsidian floor  Don't take the water away, just keep placing it?
Best 18 min of my life
*A PETHER NORTAL*
a bedroom with complitly sound proof walls 😏
“It’ll be fine” both animals die “It wasn’t “
“Just gonna say no to all of these” “Yea they said ‘no’ back “
”I’ve been there so long it’s been an ice age “
my guy sacrifices his sanity for these silly minecraft builds 😭
I don’t watch this channel for 1 year come back and he has his merch and 1.6 mil subs, congrats to u kolanii (or molanni)
masterpeice
The way that kolanii says and does in his videos are extremely hilarious and funny at the same time it is amazing how he does it
Can't believe he did so much before making an actual base lol
Wow 0:0
before the caves and cliffs updates i used to do this in creative and change netherack to stone to make like a nice pirate grove/giant open cave
Funny
it beautiful! i love the result!!
Now turn the real world into the Nether.
I once had a silk touch and fortune on the same tool, I was like "wait what really? How it is even possible" it was so long ago and thanks to you I can see Microsoft did not fix this 😅
You should build a plane outside of the nether portal over the island
"I put an ocean in the nether in hardcore"  Me: But why?
Your videos are really helping me through some tough times. Every time im bedridden I just put on one of your videos and it really helps me feel better, thank you kolanii.
Kolanii didn't just an ocean into the nether, he put a piece of the overworld in it.
The og OOO
Love the video but where’s the dolphin?!?
@kolanii my name is ayoub, and i was a viewer & fan from your start, and i liked the old kolanii in recoding video more, can i know why you changed?
The amount of dedication that this took. Subscribed. Easily. 😊
Anyone wondering how his time machine is made of wood?
*meanwhile in ohio:*
I'll see you in 2 months
Water in the nether really should be a thing. Kinda sucks to build a base in the nether when you can’t put a bed or water in it.   It makes sense that the end does this since it’s a mind warping alternate dimension, but the nethers more of a dark reflection of the main world.... or atleast it’s supposed to be.
i do not know why but your title made me remember i put the lime in the coconut song lol
-._-.
he fr built an ocean
I want this in my world
😅 This hits different after Game Theory's recent video.Thanks for healing the nether!
You stole a living thing!
A day before I made this comment, MatPat made a vid of how there used to me water in the nether.
"im gonna steal an entire reef" take notes gru
I'm on the floor laughing, "you just got uno reversed"
waw ... incredible ...
detroit simulator
You can do it with commands and glichs also hacks
That pig sound 😅
Wow this isn't what I was expecting when I clicked the video   Is even better! Great work : D
I miss the old days when it would just start snowing in the middle of a grass Biome, and you would watch it slowly cover the ground through the glass block windows of your wooden home.
Mojang: Welcome to the Nether, you might call it hell. Kolanii: Where's the swimming pool?
You could have used frost Walker boots while breaking the glow stone
This got to be the most illegal world in existence
That poor soul needs more subscribers and help because I love just giving up after one day why does he say it all night doing this if he does I’m his new subscriber and I feel so bad🥲
this world looks like my old world from my old ipad
wow. first of all i can'gt do that much, my head would just blowed off. the coolest thing you made but people who don't sub should take jail.
This might possibly be the most impressive build in hardcore ever.
respect the grind
You should finish 300 days one block sky block! It was such a good series.
Why did i die when he said "It'll be fine.. it wasnt"
I felt pain when I saw him build the land above the water instead of in it, I wouldn’t want to get rid of any water either.
you are a genius
Lol this guy never  fails to amaze me
kolanii, instead of breaking all the glowstone manually, why didn't you just blow it up with tnt?
“Wait that’s illegal.”
16:06
Build the backrooms
But dad.. I wanted a pony :(
16:05 cracked me up, thank goodness for totems
can you make a castle in the void?
most people: Oh god if i have to roll my world back 15 minutes i worry about world corruption every time kolanii: ok we're going back to 1986 in my world today, there was a neat update i wanted to check out
Just watching kolanii trying to make an ocean in nether makes my hands numb and my eyes dry asf, Kolanii never fails to impressed me
Man I just hate it when those big big big ain't looking too nice
you sound like pyrocynical took a slightly different life direction
breh
I respect the dedication and attention to detail I would have given up halfway through.
Kolanii! HEAR ME OUT. What if.... you build the reverse nether portal you build in the overworld, in the nether on that island. A big Mangrove tree with the river cutting between the roots?!
This whole video has me scraching my brain im just like huhhh?
It’s so illegal
Great world
Sometimes I wake up thinking I’m good at Minecraft but then I remember bastards like you haven’t been put down yet 🙂
Please show this work or make it downloadable! That's actually incredible.
You know what, I’ll say it. I’m scared of him. Like really scared of him.
Meanwhile me just changing the texture of lava to look like water
did anyone read the phases at the start?
use baritone for placing
Normal videos: titel makes everything seem better but still a lil clickbait Kolanii: takes everything a step further building an island
Kolanii I just fell asleep to your entire hardcore playlist it soothed me to sleep last night
His upload schedule is a tactic because dude I've watched this seven times already (in anticipation of the next video months later)
Its kinda funny when I saw the end bruh is everything reversed?
Ths guy put the nether in the overworld and he put the overworld and some nether in the end now the overworld in the nether what now the end in the overworld?
sir you did not stop at putting an ocean in the nether. YOU PUT _THE_ OCEAN IN THE NETHER YOU MADLAD
can we just appreciate how much sanity he loses for our entertainment, because i would've given up even starting the recording
Sick green screen!
I think glak Jack copied you, he at least copied your thumnail
tip for next time you do this: dont use any nether blocks to stop the water while covering the lava. Ghasts can only spawn on nether blocks, and you used netherack to stop the water, a nether block.
Anyone can please tell me what shader did Kolanii used? The rain is just so gorgeous.
when he says no he sounds like simon cowell
Kolanii you created Minecraft generation in nether wow nice
Why’s this an ad lol?
him : ocean monuments me: wow him: *breaks ruins*
I think kolanii would be some person that will rule the minecraft criminal activities hall (mcah)
They way he could've just used torches instead of glowstone
Sometimes i got confused if he was in the overworld or the Nether xd
I found this video on a ad
I just realized you only have 19 videos on this channel and upload extreme rarely, which is really not good for the algorithm. And yet you still got 1.62 million subscribers in such a short time. Based.
Hmmmmm dirt house episode 2? :(
Anyone noticed how he’s voice has gone higher?
Who remembers molelanii 😂
Kolanii I really wish u would bring back one block sky block for 300 hundred days because I really liked that series and I’m sure everyone else did to
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This man loves torturing himself
My first thought while reading the title of the thumbnal: „NOO! THAT‘S ILLEGAL!😨🤬“
He should've made an iron golem tho so he can kill the pigmans easier (?)
This is Minecraft Ohio 😂
British accent
it's quite concerning
Ghast: oh, dont mind me spawning in the middle of whatever you're doing
Wait that's illegal
{}
This would be a cool biome. “Terraformed Ocean”
Him every cut: - It's for a video, it's for a video...
but... you know that the villagers will escape through that unprotected portal
when i saw the pig in the boat oh lord i think i just saw baby technoblade vibing😆😇❤️
*almost dies in hardcore* Kolanii : continues on like nothing happened
Bro was playing ohiocraft
12:40 “The grinch who stole— the SEA??”
Discovering this delightful channel & chap has been a highlight of the year. I vibe to the music, laugh to pretty much everything he says, love he what he builds etc - I SMASHLIKE every time. Chad. Best 2022 YouTuber.
Wait what
Erm u didn't have to use  turtles to distract pigs there is a bug were if u place a door sideways instead of directly like usual, it confuses the AI of the pig(and zombies) making it think the door is open(a cheaper and easier way) a link on how: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/57999bbQExU
wow
The "Time machine" bit was giving me old stampy vibes lmao
I cant tell what was harder. Making the content or editing it perfectly in 18 minutes showing everything but in a more compressed way
Alternative title: episode 7.2: Focusing on ONE illegal thing.
God: Noah, TAKE THE FUCKING BOAT
You could also have done it with one 1.19 snapshot, where it was possible to get water by placing glow vines in lava.
You Just Got A New Subscriber :)
Nahh men i love the accent so much
13:27 cant have sh*t in ohio/detort/romainea
hi :) kolanii
I LOVE the phases
Fucking love this highly quality vids
HOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT
ahahaha you has broke this minecraft
Mad respect, dude. You’ve more than earned a sub. I’ll donate in the future, promise.   I can’t wait to see your cavernous house!
how is it possible to go back versions in the same world without everything corrupting like he did in this video.
Now put the entire nether in the ocean
I legit thought this was boffy for a sec and got really confused
pure boffy
I watched this whole video at 2x speed and it was so chaotic
normal day in the nether
ues
I love that he built an entire ocean but gave up to build a farm cause couldn’t place water ☠️
17:11 Did the sheep turned into a pig? Oh the pig is just suffocating Wait..
How and why
dislikes are from mojang
This man's a legend, he could've stopped after placing water but decided to add all of this detail, can't imagine how long this must've taken
I want to know how he actually does this. The curiosity is killing me.
i think an interesting challenge would be trying to beat the ender dragon without crafting anything, just relying entirely on villagers and stuff you pick up
Ive heard of plants going through concrete but not one splitting a whole mountain
This is so cursed
is this skyblock now?
I like how he did everything in the thumbnail legit except the dolphin. Those things are impossible to keep alive, or move anywhere
Dude do you have a life..?
and all this, in hardcore that's impressive
Bruh brokes the entire game mechanics lol
Men just do the biggest crime in minecraft hardcore history and simply be : |  in thumbnail
omgggg... I've missed u so much, kolanii. it's been a years since i watched your last vid :/
In last video he used lot of engineering to make the weird portal but he could come in thid version and take portal block oof :(
One more video and he’s gonna corrupt the world
16:58 nobody in the comments said anything about nod if you're scared
Mojang spent time coding that water can't be in the nether and Kolanii was like I can change that
omfg you just are crazy
dedication
Dutch people: confused screaming
I want to see 16:05 in an alternate universe where he doesn't have a totem just so I can perfectly cut it
Is it legal
Guys I think we should spam dislike on all of his videos until he takes a nap. He works too hard. When he wakes up we can like all of them again.
an ad was placed right after the house started blowing up.😂😂😂
16:22 "You look like you need a day off my friend." XDDDDD I don't think I have heard anyone say that to an iron golem Xdd
You are foking crazyy and I like it W vid
<3 Kolanii
Average Ohio ocean
dozer will stop ur eye ocean (crying) https://youtu.be/IIEN3aODy3Q
Absolute legend
Bro the og looking cake is so nostalgic 😢
i need you in my modded server pronto
This video is just kolanii populating an island of kidnapped villagers and defying all known physics in hell
Wait, that's illegal
How do I play this update?
Kolani: puts an ocean in the nether   Me: Can't even beat the ender dragon
this was so cool!!! i love this new style of lets play. a good balance of breaking the game and cheating but also hard work and cool concepts !!!
Sponge walls attack arc
God Loves You All❤❤❤
Why?
You should play infinite dimensions to get more illegal items
ello
You are way too aggressively casual with things that end up using a totem.
“Alright let’s just take some..nothing”
day 23573248975 of asking for over the top dirthouse
.
12:16 Big big big what?
6:42
Welcome to another episode of "why would you hurt yourself like this....but I'm glad you did."
minecraft rules no putting water in nether
You wasted 1 minute of my life. Thanks
Damn the water becoming ice actually gave so much nostalgia, nowadays I barely see that happening
A fake
I put water in the nether using commands
I was already very impressed with just the huge ocean in the nether but you just kept on adding more and more detail, it's just incredible! It feels like I should be paying to watch this
The moment you started breeding the Villagers in the Nether I was waiting for you to blow it up
also if you dont want piglins to break your doors you can just put them sideways and then open
Thats a good idea!.  *boom* Okay Thats Bad Idea.
Ho i have a bit of detail for your '' ruined '' portal , add things that look like Moss on the block
make a backup of your world and see what happens if you upgrade the illegal pickaxe to netherite
I remember once I found a lake in the nether
0:48 I admit that it was a smooth transition
The editing and the music choices rly are amazing, good work mate
He did this cause he felt like it
12:30 YOU WERE LITTERALY 1 HEART NO TOTEM YOU COULDVE LOST IT ALL
Does this guy hate pigs or technoblade bc he made a pig farm in the last illegal items video
this defines 8/(0-31)/22 yr old me’s brain
Wait.. REDSTONE DIDN’T EXIST BACK THEN
I just saw an ad for ohio
The mental state he is at is just garbage and the pain he goes through  every video he Makes
World download and I’d *then* buy something
I LOVE KOLANII🎉😂❤🎉😂❤😂😂😂❤❤❤❤😂🎉🎉😂❤❤
Not steal borrow forever:).
Really enjoy the video
God loves you
I used to do this all the time as a kid back in like 2014. Replace the floor of Netherack with dirt, cielings and walls with stone, lava ocean with water, all netherack blocks touching the lava with sand, bonemealed grass, grew trees, added vines etc.  Would do it for large areas of the nether by hand. I have no idea why I'd do it, it's not like i kept any saves, also used to do it on random peoples xbox worlds lmao.
You should go to the farlands in an old version and then come back and build something cool around it
Why is no one talking abt the beds in the nether-
Why is no one talking abt the beds in the nether-
you're a maniac.    i like that
make a world download plz
dan wells 🤯
LMAO W
This video is fake because time machines only work with birch planks
NICE
My guy played minecraft ohio version
Once you're finished with your hardcore world, will you upload it?
12:00
Just copy an ocean and paste it in the nether using structure block
Ohio😊
Your are insane
Now he has another illegal portal. The sideways portal. The Nether Sortal
My mom says your name is cute
9:59 its a warcrime
Even when our time has passed I'm sure someone somewhere in the future will find this video and appreciate the effort put in.
Other hardcore youtubers collecting every mob Kolanii causally building a ocean
My question is why didn’t he use moss for the island?
minecraft youtubers with these kinds of skins are getting annoying.
Shouldve made the village look ancient like nobody knew they were there until you discovered it.
The amount of dedication put into this…
Nice Video!
don't infinite water source mechanics work in the old versions to fill the layers?
name it Hell's Paradise
awesome! I'm curious about how it would look like with a false sky ceiling with stars and everything
Oh my god I loved this video
Very Inspirational.
Now we are gonna steal a reef: Okay... Now we are gonna steal an entire reef: Oh
Imagine you’re just a normal villager, you’re sleeping in your cozy, comfy bed with your eyes open and suddenly some random solid-colored white dude appears and just steals everything in your house. Then you randomly wake up in a hell-like dimension inside your bed
They took notch out of Minecraft and that shxt gay.
I wonder if you have a Minecraft server we all can join and have fun
Nice
been here since like 150k or smthn and am still thoroughly impressed at this man’s efforts
i like ur vids Konami, i hope you'll make more like this,
Where da kelp doin?
Nice vid
your finger has got six-pack after this video
minecraft youtubers will create the worlds worst merch and then try to sell it to you
Kolanii be like at the end of the video: *eats fresh Nether produce  aka. Nether-Cod
2:52 if you break your bed while sleeping, you get suffocated when walking to a 2-block high wall
now the /place command says whattttt!
Mojang is absolutely furious watching this video like actually shaking from the anger they're literally trying so hard to find any reason to ban you other than "bruh he using water in the nether!!"
All is kolanii doing is just building lazy lake from fortnite (but with multiple houses)... but in hell..
when he tried to sleep in the nether and exploded it i laughed so hard
That was the most absurd, delicious nonsense I've ever seen with a Minecraft video.  You just earned yourself a subscribe.
Uh king I think you dropped this 👑
bro should be in the next hermitcraft series
U don’t know how much I love you and your content i mean when i see you upload a video i be the happiest man ever plz don’t stop❤️
Me : can't find shipwreck  Kolanii: builds a shipwreck in the nether
No one: Kolanii: I am going to put a sea in the nether
what if there was a server that let you import chunks into the world if you can prove you built it in a hardcore world
16:06 I haven’t laughed out loud in so long
The way the pig actually nodded got me laughing a little.
Love how illegal it is and yet it's not cheating
i think it would've been easier if you used that snapshot of 1.17 i think that you could turn lava into water by placing a glow liquen inside of it
No, you didn’t. This is click bait
Kolanii ur evil for this
u should put all the illegal items there
how do you play beta ive been trying for an hour
breaking news: local man uses time travel and extremely muscular finger to relocate coral reef, village, turtle population to Hell; everyone likes it there but the pigs
Wait din5you die by th3 warden
Pethernortal
This man's dedication is scary
u should probably put some tropical fish as well since it's a reef
Put a ocean monument in it
Okay the pickaxe with Fortune and Silk Touch is broken af
When i see the title of this video and the thumbnail i was like:  ......what the f- What the flip did i just see and read
the level of dedication is nuts.
Honestly i thought you would use that snapshot where glow lichen turns lava to water
Alternative title: I created Florida in Minecraft
top  😊
you can't put water in the Nether
This is the funniest video i have seen ever😂😂😂
11:16 hey look he's making loot lack
I’m a little bit impressed
bru the dude puts so many hours in this just for us so thanks
Lowkey his merch could be an acne dupe
Me here b4 watching the vid, just put ice and see if it melts
The determination need for a project like this is astronomical.
Dude has to use water breathing and fire resistance at the same time.
I just love this. Every little thing
I am crying 😹Yer hilarious
Couldn't of he just used the icewalker enchantment to break the glowstone?
Ocean on nether is easy, i wanna see you bring lava to the overworld
13:26 Detroit be like
I got a sheet of playable water in regular survival by accident once because I was drowning and holding a silk touch pickax and it somehow just happened. I put it above my door as a trophy and it was real cool until a creeper blew up my front entrance
Omg. This screams Let'sGameItOut energy and I mean that in the biggest compliment possible. I am so happy I discovered you you're a mad man lmao
so MUCH SSSPOOOONNNNNGEEEEESSSSSSS
13:22 Romania
Grian would be proud of your terraforming.
the house that was made from every single block in the game reminded me back of my glory minecraft days
Absolute natural talent
On bedrock edition you can structure block water in the nether and it is red
Me at the beginning I was like how just how like just just how
Now put a nether in a entire ocean
13:52 even the bees are there 😲
Uhhhhhh this is odd
This guy’s humour is the best I love it
Silk touch and fortune…. Litterally just a duper
l:)
You are going to jail
i cant believe thats possible 😮
KOLANII WE NEED MORE CONTENT AND FASTER!!! As always much love and keep up the good work!
It actually looks really good bro
You look like you need a day off🤣
Villager: "Hmm" I'm sleepy **proceed to sleep in the Nether** 😎🖕
You could just break all the glow stones with tnt
You were dead when water worked in the nether  Me:puts water in nether FBI open up!!! Me: *dead on the floor* X_X FBI: stupid ._.
But now we need a nether in the end dimension….
Bro I was just scrolling YouTube and I see "I put the entire ocean in the nether" 💀
What was 18 minutes to us took countless hours for him. The dedication is amazing
Lest goo this is guy is a champ
I ended the vid as he said „in this update you can place water in the nether“
bro's defeanetly on an fbi watchlist
U are a mad man
Algorithm gang
the amount of effort and pain balances each other out.
6:44 bedrock edition moment  I really really hope that you lied to us and put all that sand in using cheats. It would be too unbearable to do it legit. This video is just for entertainment, i dont mind if you cheated, id rather you put all that in a couple minutes using cheats than hours legitimately.
Kolani is taking mc to a whole new level
God bless you, editing!
I love you're video's they're the best
POURQUOI EST EC QUE JE SUIS ABONNÉ À ÇA ?!
Me seeing the Thumbnail: you can't Bring the ocean into the nether so just bring the nether into the ocean... *🧠YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CUT ME OFF...🧠*
INUTILE
LMAO WTF AHHAHA
That pickaxe can dupe ores so i can call it  Dupy-pick
Now for the heart of the sea monument so you can see and breathe underwater. Add some ruins to
Where the hell is the 300 day one block
In 6:43 I love that phase 3, 6, and 8 were all just "Regret Life Choices" because, well he's been doing life choices he would probably regret
Cool
all my homies like kolani the giga chad
This man woke up and chose the defiance of god, jesus christ and the holy spirit.
Him clicking the bed and it exploding after seeing the villagers sleeping in them cracked me tf up😂💀
Well yet another bug i guess if anyone want put water in nether just change the old version when ITS done back to the new update cool and stupid bug🗿🗿🗿
Youtube recommended me this.  And I'm glad they did.
You have the ocean of 1.13, you have the village of 1.14, you got the bees one some of your trees from 1.15 and youre in the 1.16 nether
15:39 the vilager literally walked over the boat XD
12:03 rehten portal gave me an idea about buildng an inverted portal like teh thumbnail in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFO1iqDpMZU but  the nether portal block placed in teh timestamp I put a comment on
Fun fact:go touch some grass
100 days in the nether?
“The master bed…”room.. 💀
I love floor crafting😍
If only you could use proper console commands and command blocks for this challenge
He forgot killer bed  😂
uh
16:05 that scared the shit out of me XD
Boffy V2
Duuude he is hardworking soo much I think he spent hours to make the video and he compressed the video to 18 minutes.... A big salute my man
I saw this video said no and clicked it
The most impressive part of the “sea in the Nether” video is somehow the slick Elytra precision at the end
Bro puts too much effort into these videos
u remind me of stampy cat if he was way more angry and bitter and hated everything
0:04 don't know why but him nodding his head is cute
And I thought I did too much terraforming 🤯🤯
this is freaking crazy
this is actually insane
A pether nortal
Bros got a tardis
eu amo você.
The ocean in the nether makes it so much less worrying
this is cursed
Good video!
I'd honestly be more impressed if you'd done this via chunk corruption rather than just backtracing to an older version.
Love the beds
O god kolanii.. when perfectionist meets perfection
very wacky 👍 10/10 would watch again
For some reason this villager want to run away from being forced to reproduce
this man is a psychopath and a I love people like that.
the amount of time and effort makes my skin crawl in a good way
He sounds like Slogo
Siuuuuuu
The fact that he almost died
He's going to put all that effort in only for the villagers to explode it cuz you can't sleep in the nether
are you Australian?
Love your videos so much always make my day. <3 have you ever went outdoors
I know something we did on the 360 version was melting ice
This mentality pained me
astronaunts turning mars into earth :
Hol up….    This feels illegal
"silk touch and fortune together? that's not physically possible!"  Me with a silk touch fortune pick in 1.19.2:
Kolanii is the definition of "worth the wait"
ayo is there a world download link ?
very illegal world 😂
Ohio update….
Boffy?
14:49 demonic possession caught in 4k
Do a 300 days Minecraft Skyblock with your Minecraft Skyblock thing
no way
this is just the best thing ever
Kolanii never stop uploading,your videos have been sustaining life on earth,the world economy depends on you posting or not,the world shall collapse the day you stop and we do not want the videos anymore WE NEED THEM  ps please make sure to take care of your health the amount of work put into these videos are concerning
First time seeing your video and it was awesome, so much effort I loved it.
Where are the fishes
Um...911?
Wow…..
How much would you cry if you lost this world
Ok by we will meet you next month 😂
0:19 vsauce sound effect is missing
This is SO totally real and definitely not fake
How have I only just found out about this dude…??
This video should be called minecraft but illegall  Like there was ocean in the nether silk thouch looting 2 diamond pickaxe and there was half destroyed time machine that worked
this is the most cursed video I have ever seen......
You can spread water with kelp.  You only needed one water source.
You should of made new diamond armour and get every enchantment on it and make new netherite armour to make op armour
if you put blue torches pigmen won't spawn
Here me out.. 100 days in a random drops world
your world is cursed. i think i can say this was only in ohio
what
u forgot to say : see you next month 😑!!
My god! This is a lot of hard work bro😕 here's a like for it👍
Kolanii you dirty dog you’ve done it.
Every time I watch your videos, I get headache
you sound like dantdm but with crippling depression
you sound like dantdm with depression
I did this in bedrock with the /filll command
Bedrock player:hmmp look what they're doing  😎
how does hihs world handle this much corruption lol, when I tried downgrading a test world, I logged back in the latest version and my seed changed lol
How's your fingers?
Now you need to make a nether lava ocean in the overworld
I feel severely overstimulated by the pacing of this video, idk if that's just me
Kolanii really should make a downloadable map of this
....... W A T E R
Maybe in the future u might get more illegals.
i like this guy now =]]
Mommmm, kolanii is scaring me again :(
His "placing finger" is stronger than his entire body after doing these videos
The dedication is truly amazing 👏
Why didn’t you build a beacon with your hard earned items.
That's insane Who could've known you could glitch the game and do things like that that I guess everything is possible in Minecraft now
Your accent is so cute UwU
Hi
damn bro, that was amazing but I think you need some grass to touch 💀
I did something like this along time ago, i built i giant tree in the nether then placed ice blocks which melted on they're own and made water in the nether. it was probably the coolest thing i ever built on the game.🙂
most normal base in ohio LOL
17:49 ngl I thought he was gonna build an actual ocean monument, kinda disappointed
This was insane
Fun fact In bedrock water is red in the nether.
This build is really something to be proud of Kolanii! Enjoyed the video.
The fbi wants to know where kolanii lives
Yo kolanii can you please finish sky block it’s kill me on thin in side if any one thing he should like and share this post and spam if in his nexted video
what the ffff
Kolanii in 2-6 years : "I Built a House outside the World Border in Minecraft Hardcore"
He is somehow monotone and happy sounding at the same time
Sneeze once and you skip 3 hours of work and 2 hours of editing
Just clicked on the video, if I can do whatever I want in a sandbox game... could I perhaps eat the sand?
12:44 you can steal a reef but not Thanksgiving spirit in words of my teacher just about something else
Gimme the world please 🙏
This is actually a reenactment of people putting towns in Florida 😳
Does someone know what the music that is played at 3:00 is?
15:26 it's the wrong version of "your" and it's driving me crazy...
the amount of dedication and work honestly blows my mind!
scroll down in the comment section there are so many bots all talking about something completely unrelated
I love the quirky and unique content keep it up kolani! 👍
Usually I wouldn't care about people showcasing how they did this and that just for the flex. But the sheer pain you went through earned my respect. Congrats.
new ppl watching his videos after this video: *w h a t* Edit: made it bold
This video is cursed
Bro why the hell are you playing on 1.0?
You have an absurd amount of free time and willpower Kolanii.
Another GREAAAT video
You guys might be complaining that his totally legit time machine is just a man-sized box with a door. I'm just grateful he didn't make it blue.
Lol 16:05
BRO YOU ARE SOOO FUNNY
God dammit I loved that self destruct bed blunder
I feel like this idea would take days but if your up to it, you could make the ruined portal lead to a exact copy of what you just built and the nether around it so it would feel like a portal to nothing
i love how kolanii is like that one kid in school who always goes the extra mile but hates doing it
Sent the villagers going to escape through the portal?
epic, now do it without mods n stuffs
1. Retexture lava for water 2. DONE
What in the god damn hell is going on
The average Rick and North episode.
Oh my god, I know you're not, but I was wondering if cumin could play such a big role. One reason I want to know your values ​​is because I want to destroy the Boyd Zoo and the Guild.

“Ahh can’t place water” literally millions of water blocker around him
I literally laughed out loud with the “you look like you need a day off my friend” caught me so off guard.
How long do your videos take to make? Especially this one, I'm curious. Do you give yourself breaks (like a day or two away from this whole process and then come back to it) or do you do it consecutively ?
your island looks like vagina
I played on a public smp and found a single water source block in the nether that was created by a glitch (something to do with core protect I think) and made flying machines to turn the one source block into an ocean lmao If you ever want to move the water in modern versions put it in a mangrove root and push it with a sticky piston powered by a one or zero tick pulse :)
911 what's your emergensy
you've done ocean in the nether... now try nether in the ocean 😳
Wow the amount of people in the comments who think this is legit. He cheated in xp like a loser
Good job! Everything was a masterpiece and was so Beautiful and good! Keep up the good work!
you should try out 100 days in RL craft, just started playing it for the first time without watching any tutorials (besides the very first things to actually get wood) and its been a ton of fun
I love how he continually calls himself lazy for leaving out the minor details in such a GINORMOUS project so many people wouldn't even bother to deal with 💀
Terraria NPCs 🤝 Minecraft Villagers Having no problem living in literal hell
I just noticed. You are actually very good at building
He had 87 SAND!?!?!
was this fake?
The Time Machine is the best part!
11:12 that part lmao
Would it have been easier to build the nether in an ocean…
i thought you were going to empy the lava, and then re fill it with water, this is still pretty cool tho
your video's make me laugh, just what I needed!! :)
Kolanii is something else. Something new yet its the old trends. Perfection.
One of my friends showed me this video jesus christ, son
where original content?
I love how much work he put in this  video
the commitment is insane
can you release the world download of the world
I subscribed yesterday when you had almost 500k subs because I wanted to be in the 500k group, I subbed just in time because now you have over 1.5 mil
Could you have just put torches on ice?
Reminds me something off Minecraft Story Mode
Bro go to sleep, your body is probably decaying. Respect
This is how you get the "serious dedication" advancement, not some hoe made of debris
That Hurt my eyes water in the nether
How does one have the will power to do this
hi
Hi, From india♥️💚
2:18 for some reason I thought that door was a redstone door connected to the cake lol
Talk about dedication.
This is top tier content. I can't imagine the absolute nightmares that you've went thru to create this tho xD
Kolanii is cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oceans 15 starring Kolanii
You could have just placed the ice in a diagonal line and it would have filled in the entire square.  I say if there's a way to do it, there's probably a way to do it better, work smarter, not harder.   Although kolani is not the smartest of people
you sound like koopkool's bro
My personal head cannon is that the ghasts knew you were breaking the world and tried to stop you, but you were too powerful.
Why does the music fit so well with the how rediculous this is?
i thought this was in a different world bruhh
Imagine if one of the blocks update and the entire ocean goes poof
What Ching him is like watching an old children’s YouTuber in 2015. This is enjoyable.
How do u have 1M teach me your ways MaN
Ty for realizing my childhood dream in vanilla minecraft
He finally posted again i love his vids smm
next build a better time machine
Actually if you want to build the overworld in the nether you need to do it at 1/8 the scale
the nether looks alot friendlier with a water ocean instead of lava
You kinda remind me of LetsGameitOut but a little bit more sane
This is a lol video😂
So france
Couldn't you place the ice diagonally down to the sand and save a lot of work?
whait, thats illegal
"okay I'm going to have to steal your house. Blink once if you don't want me to."  (Inhuman unblinking games of a quote unquote sleeping villager)
I cant belive you sentenced villagers to hell
Are you ok/do you need a hug. That much work would make me want to kill myself.
And thats how you corrupt your pc, and get lots of virus 💀
17:13 "It'll be fine" "It wasn't"
2:25, the design is very normal
Bro that looks like Australia 😂
hey kolanii, was wondering if you have a discord server? thanks!
The fact that Skyes, Paul, AND YouTube commented on this. I feel like I just witnessed history.
Bro terraformed the nether in minecraft
You should do a shipwreck
Why is this Bullshyt comin' up on My feed? I got No interest this nonsense whatsoever.
Try satisfying things
Cool, now put an entire nether in the ocean.
Let's just appreciate his work on his videos
17:14 😂😂
it's wild how i knew that you can go back versions if you are careful and i knew that you used to be able to glitch water into the nether (in multiple ways) but i never thought of connecting the dots and making an ocean in the nether lmao
the amount of times he can just say he's done and people will be happy, but just adds more details is so crazy
your vidos are awsome you are a grat inspiration and i love how much effort u put on them
17:24 Latitude isn't height lol. Closest word to that is altitude.
Kolanii is braking Minecraft in every way possible, imagine a world download link
Olla
best hardcore world ever
Idk why but... I'm in love
you better get the illegal protection 8 gold helmet and protection 6 diamons helmet
Alternate title: How 2b2t's nether was ruined
I don't think anybody is going to top that for creativity. That was insane so much detail
you need me dont lie
all your version hopping has given me the idea to travel 12million blocks via nether roof and backdate to generate the farlands in my hardcore world
John 3:16-18    Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls.
Congrats, you've introduced Piglins to a concept they've never seen before, Striders are terrified of this Cold Lava, and the Ghasts are still being assholes.
Grian eat your heart out
Is no one else concerned he reached 2.5 hearts while in range of an angered piglin brute?
Pause at 13:31 Overworld or Nether?
Even the title is illegal I can’t wait till the video😂
This was rather Amazing and your so funny too, a perfect combination. ✨✨✨✨✨✅👍👍
“Because you definitely can’t do that. *Or can you?* “ Me: Didn’t know you were collabing with some one.
16:07 how did u forget the first rule of nether
You should have a face off against “Let’s Game It Out” in Minecraft or at least a let’s play
I place a hair tie on the controller and trigger.
u didn't collect the half door and bed
تمام
I’m gonna cry because that time machine reminded me of Stampy’s time machine and now I feel nostalgic-
For destroying the glow stone, the fastest way would’ve been frost walker.
A short animation: https://youtube.com/shorts/AuVScy6El9Q?feature=share
neat!
This man’s world is growing more illegal every video. Kolanii knows no limits
Hard work
ROBLOX ARMY
"nether fish is not real, he cannot hurt you" nether fish: 18:37
never, fish nether fish? no, no no, can never, fish. fish, can never, nether, fish.
Only in Ohio..
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                                            /,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.,./ ,
you built an ocean in the nether but why not build a nether in the ocean
the amount of times he can just say he's done and people will be happy, but just adds more details is so crazy
how is he somehow monotone and happy sounding at the same time
You know.. I almost always watch videos in 1.75 speed but this time.. It actually feels like it was meant to be this fast.
man finds an illegal pickaxe by sheer accident on his way to do completely unrelated illegalities
10:49 the best beat ive ever heard
You have a pleasant voice to hear
I miss the hardcore series
It’s actually ancient ruins not monument
I just did that with world edit and i didn't need to make a bunch of shit excuses for myself
Of course the video ends off on something illegal
This  man does all the things that no one else could possibly have time to do. Like how many hours ya think he spent on this
When will the eggs hatch?🥚
Your Minecraft world is the type of world I would imagine and then quit after a few hours lol
Who knew that hell could look so relaxing?
I will feel so bad if he dies
Can we just appreciate on how much pain he goes through when making the videos?
Not first
Not first
Not first
Why
I liked watching it but I just disagree with all of the video lol.
He deserves more credit for this.
Nether ocean village or Iranian refugee camp
Fortune and silk used to be able to be on same item
Minecraft vids nowadays are something
Wow EPIC. and you were eating pork... piggies dont like pork eaters. Brilliant Vid
15:41 LOLME FEEDING THE KIDS IN MY BASEMENT
Island in the middle of the nether aka, playing animal crossing new horizons in 2020
honstly you should make these worlds downloadable and like upload some buldion tutorials on a second channle
Now you should put the nether around an ocean next
Impossible
11:13 🤨 anyways great build! very nice 👌
Glad you're back!|
you are doing so good i wish you become a famuos yter
pether nortal
I'm not sure if it would work but can't you just place something waterloggable like stairs in the water and then push them with pistons to "move" the water?
That wavy glowstone pattern is interesting indeed
The amount of effort he puts into his videos is both worrying and impressive.
The building montage is really what happens when you hit create new world
Thank you for putting so much work into your vids my man
Imagine going to the nether for lava only to find an ocean. Also, if you ever need a break, we won’t get mad at you for doing so :)
Why does the water not disappear?
if you place the doors so they look like they're open then close them they can't be attacked
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮？
are you ok?
Humans tryna colonize Mars be like:
Plz sub to my chanel. It would mean the world to me https://youtube.com/@doritoborito
Damn, me and my buddies had a 1.6 server using hamachi over ten years ago. I was 13 then. I don’t talk to them anymore, one of them died even. It’s nostalgic to be reminded of that time when things were simple.
Are you sip over
Ty for taking time out of your day to make videos for us!
Yay people suffering 😂
I’m glad you’re back in my reccomendeds
All time favorite YouTuber right here
Ok, now replace every water block in the overworld with lava
He pulled a Ph1lza but in the Nether
Neat video, but silk touch didnt exist until beta 1.9. Also, it couldnt mine ice until 12w17a. I respect the grind though.
Imagine the possibilities if you could actually place water in the nether and there was like randomly generated oceans of water in some parts of the nether
Kolanii is the embodiment of everything that is both cursed and blessed in Minecraft.
You can shift+rightclick the spawners with any spawn-eggs to change to mob output. :)
17:13 PEEING
Cool, now put an entire lava ocean in the overworld in Minecraft Hardcore
i really hope he is not just OPEN TO LANing
I want to see you beat Minecraft on the tutorial world
Will you make a world download if you die?
Ocean
Kolanii you should have used tnt to blow up the glow stone
He says he’s going to cry when he’s a grown ass man 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cool bro 😎
Bro just made Australia
Very funny worth a subscribe 17:12
You should do a redstone tutorial on the Time Machine! Because it’s obviously not just some oak planks and a door…
I love it, it's like heaven on hell.
Minecraft is a sandbox game, meaning you can do whatever you want. Want to fish? You can do that? Wanna commit arson? you can do that
That's amazing
How many hours did it take to do all that
Gorgeous
Guys we need to get rid of these big, Big, BIG
by minecraft law this is a war crime
Such a great project!
How many times did you have to fly through the island for that end part before you got it?
quality content!!
this channel produce the best minecraft out there
the good place:
The only thing that can be worse about that... ''house'' is if the master bedroom was made out of wet sponges.
you have come very far since 2020, great work (also I completely forgot I'm still subscribed to your patreon)
Can’t even had a reef or a village in Detroit    Cant even have the nether in Ohio  This is cursed
Pigman
nice Video
bro actually terraformed the nether...
1M views
“Why are uploads taking so long😢”  Kolanii:👁👄👁
A “pether nortal” 💀😂 that got me.
Bot filled
Mojang: you can't place water in the nether Kolanii: Well I did
"we're just gonna pop one there, like tha- okay I just killed a baby". XD
Alternative title: building the entire nether over the ocean
i love seeing u suffer :)
Aight see you guys next month
This is actually fucking crazy
Wait that's illegal.
"oh, you're asleep" "oh, good idea"
Me when I am 2 days late to a Kolanii video: 😔
W
Are you a masochist or smth
13:51 I belive you can 0 tick a waterlogged block to move a water source, like they did on Scicraft.
This is so fascinating seeing this video ngl 🧐
❤
*breeds a thousand villagers* kolanii: its a bit crowded in here
Yessir
And don‘t forget the fisch at the end
wtf im so tired am i dreaming? water in the nether -_- :/
I guess u can place water in the Nether wastes
This reminds me of old stampy
Ok......
Oh
Me being too lazy to spend 5 minutes to grab dirt He makes a entire ocean in the nether
This is fake because u can't place water in the Nether wastes
Man said no I bring Ohio to me  Also kinda gives me subnautica  vibes
Man said no I bring Ohio to me  Also kinda gives me subnatica vibes
Just like @Thete he put an ocean in the nether in 2021 and is currently working on a jungle 500x500 blocks all in the  nether
my man really be stealing houses from villagers like is Detroit
not using frost walker to destroy the glowstone 😢
Okay- I'm subscribing.
When he clicked the bed in the nether, I died!
With each video kolanii get closer and closer of managing to use a command block in survival.
Cheese
It looks nice
Nice content would way more but I just discovered this channel today
you can get illegal 65 stack of books in previous snapshot
17:12 My life story
One thing... YOU FORGOT FISH IN THE SEA
I love kolanii, he is so funny. When he clicked the bed I lite lost it
Island shape is amogus
10:44 not as bad as grinding mining 60 in skyblock
Only brainless morons would play this game talk about devolving
The unemployed friend on 2pm on a Tuesday
can you fish in the nether?
Jeez  I'm honestly not afraid to say that your videos are even better than dream's videos :] 👌
Zombie piglins are doorsist racist and doors yeah righ……. Uh
DID YOU NOT SEE HOW CLOSE YOU WERE TO DYING ?!?!? 12:28
Dude the effort in these vids is amazing. You are super underrated!!
Within 3 days!
About the breaking down of doors: I’ve heard (but not tested out myself) that if you place them down sideways, so it looks open but is registered as closed, and then close them which is registered as opening, the mobs won’t break them down because the AI thinks they’re open. Hope that makes sense, and great video 👍😊
You're incredible Kolanii
Now that was seriously impressive..  Who would have thought that this was even possible...
16:04 is such a bruh moment right there
16:06 "Oh, good idea" *Proceeds trying to sleep in the nether*
Mans is goated and has the perfect voice for the explanations haha, gotta love the attention to detail as well! Great vid all around 💯
Try to break diamond ore with fortune + silk touch pickaxe
Quality content as always!   Will never get tired of watching your videos man!
W for Kolanii🔥
you're so good at minecraft

The among us island but it cut in half (Sus)
Yes
I love these videos because it shows all the new kids to the game just how shitty in the perfect way Minecraft was back in the day
https://youtu.be/FqUxkb2tW4s
“It will be fine” Death* “It wasn’t”
keep up the good work
I like how the ghast spawns and he's like were is it
hello
kolanii is the kind of guy to define what's possible and make what's impossible possible
Dedication 100
" I'm stuck, hehe... Yeah... "  Kolanii, 2022.
Hey Kolanii, your merch link in the description doesn't work as a clickable link
Why he sound like dollar store dantdm
Have you killed 1.58 million chickens Kolanii
Time to go blow my friends mind... Just gotta switch versions multiple times
Only ogs remember half beds
Done... what have you DONE?! -NIHILANTH
your dedication scares and impresses me
thanks for the endless suffering, enjoyed it alot :D
I think you just made the tropical getway of pigmen's dreams
Even 24 hours later I bet his finger still hurts, and especially his his should still hurt because of him NEARLY DIEING with s totem because he blew up the bed- but good job on the video!
I wonder what his reaction will be when he dies in his hardcore world.
Would it be possible to do a raid here?
No Dolphin :(
Lovely Door
Redstone dust?  minecraft: NO ITS COCAINE
kolanii you've done it again
I still couldn’t understand how did he got the water to nether lol
I was looking to collect more than just illegal items *furious typing* I was looking to collect ILLEGAL VIDEOS 👍
No, this isn't right.
I killed a child 💀
This has to be the most cursed world in existence
This is crazy
Woa, i didn't know it should work like that.
He is the braking laws player in a hardcore world
Explain this atheists
Those are just the falklands...
Woah you’re actually so good at terraforming
i feel like its illegal to watch this
You can bonemeal coral plants
Anyone else notice he has 141 levels?
Absolutely amazing video
Kolanii, That one youtuber you can't resist to click on
how did you put beds in nether          time 15.33
P
I had no idea about the zombie pigmen and and turtle eggs thing lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/UYnS5uih29M
Babe wake up new Kolanii vid just dropped
“i fear no man but this man this man scares me”
Mojang be like: "Sir, that's not legal at all."
*This video is not sponsored by PETA*
Minecraft: my physics is always mine  Kolani:oh wait I'm the god of physics
This does not look right
U need to make more of those survival videos, cause they are SOOOO funny lol
Theres a (sorta) quicker way of placing sand, although the machine would have to be moved a bit. If you stack sand on top of cobwebs with the cobwebs in front of unactivated pistons, and break the bottom piece of sand, wait a few seconds, then activate the piston, you can launch the sand a decent ways away, covering a lot of area(idk if it works in that version tho)
Imagine if you built a huge nether portal above the island making it look as if the island dropped through
Bro said Peder Nortal ( peder means gay in macedonian😂)
At least credit the Minecraft Discontinued Features Wiki...
Pov you constantly cheat it items throughout the video
i swear to god you're a Rick and Morty character
genuinely unmatched entertainment and quality. Love as always!
What is the point of life if the life I once thought I knew, no longer makes any sense. 😧 /hj
the island looks like a coffee bean
just put torch and the torch will automatically break when ice melt
I always wonder why he takes so long to make videos, and he doesn't even show his effort of all the sand placing and glowstone placing/breaking, and just ignoring it for our entertainment.. respect.
"Blink once"
BRO STOLE A VILLAGER HOUSE HAHAHHAHAHA
This is absolutely insane but I love it so much!
The less lava there is in the never do more gas will spawn I don’t know why it does that but that’s just a fact about gas The less lava there is in the never do more gas will spawn I don’t know why it does that but that’s just a fact about guests
Kolanii struggles to find the word legal in the dictionary
Touches would have been much better than glow stone ,since it will break when ice turn into water 🤔
You can still get bedrock with a bedrock breaker
The dedication is insane! Really glad you make these videos!
Why dose the island in the nether look like lungs 🫁🤣
Great video brother! Amazing job!  🐹😍
Bro why
Now replace the water in the overworld with lava
why does your level jump from 6 to 140? And then in another segment it goes from 1 to 0 ,?
I was watching this video, and when Kolanii was placing TNT it blew up, and his totem popped and a pigLynn nearly killed him. Imagine he died all that effort for nothing, but I’m glad he survived.
Kolanii on their way making nether more habitable
I was so inspired I made a huge cave system into a OCEAN!!!
Kolanii....you produce the best Minecraft videos I have ever seen. Better than Hermits, Empires, Last Life...they all wish they had your talent 👍
im moving to the neather🎶 Im moving to the neather🎶
Tbh how did he put water in the neither?
This is the most cursed hard-core world literally ever
This world is going to get so corrupted with all this time traveling
The time machine carried
It is awesome that you were able to do this !!
So hardworking you deserve 10 million or more subs 👏
Your content is peak entertainment. Love the mix of humor, creativity, and determination. Keep it up!
you’re my favorite youtuber keep up the good work
put a scorpion on the moon
I have no words for the projects you been making I just love them, you are the best minecraft YouTuber out there right now with out a doubt
Good use of time? I’m not sure.
You can't put water in nether
you could make a gold farm above you to hopefully make them spawn less
Bro your a mad man
how did you have grass blocks? thats not possible
what
Your my favourite YouTuber!
40,929/281
I’m waiting till he turns the nether into the end
If I were him I be dead because I play on mobile
i was genuinely concerned when your time machine broke.
16:06 i laugh 😂
its a kolanii video!
Kolanii: UNO REVERSE! Ghast: NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Imagine being a fan tryng to make a 1-1 replica
finallly ive been waiting for another video these videos are so cool
I understand why there’s so much time between videos
mate ..... go outside and talk to people..... live your life
9:29 Thats looks familiar
Wow, so pretty
Here's to Kolani, the Funniest Person On the Internet
6:33 average day down in Ohio 💀
Imagine how long this video would be if it was uncut
this video is so cursed yet so funny and hillarious🙃
I love ur vids but u could have just replaced the world files
Keep up all the great content :)
Yay he's back
This defies all of logic. You earned a sub!
You know you can change your placing key to a [ then hold the [ key to place faster right?
if you make kolanii plush I will eat an onion like an apple
an ad was placed as soon as you said not like this is placed before you said not and it sounded like n-
You’re correct, those big big big didn’t look nice. This is by far the best hardcore world out there! The amount of time spent sounds agonizing tho
Ahhh I'm happy for the new vid I was just rewatching old 1s 😅
this is so amazing you spend hours to make this masterpiece you deserve 5m subs
i love this videos please do more
CAN WE TAKE A SECOND TO APPRECIATE HIW MUCH EFFORT HE PUTS INTO HIS VIDEOS? 🎶  JOKES ASIDE YOUR NEVER GONNA GIVE UP

His attention to detail is **chef's kiss** perfect
Every time I start to be Impatient about how long he takes to upload, I watch the video and undeniably agree that his videos are awesome

carpal tunnel speedrun let's go you had me waiting
Kolanii is Keir and Dev’s lost brother
Kolani, you are crazy 😅
Let’s all appreciate how much effort he puts into his videos (I’m not a flippin bot)
How u placed bed in the nether?
I just dont understand how he does all of this the effort put into all the  Things he does is just incredible
Me: bad at minecraft Kolani: YES
Had to give you a sub for this i mean cmon the amount of hours it took to do this is like lets game it out levels of fuckery
"I say no to this" "Yeah it said no back"
I think u 'll break ur Hardcore world
well played for the transition of the ad
You know you can do this by /setblock ~ ~ ~ flowing_water
Normal Minecraft players: CONFUSED SCREAMING!
When I was 4 or something I played this map series called super hostile. One of the maps contained the water block. Also one of them was one of the earliest minecraft maps to use commands.
The flip from manic chaos into a genuinely nice and impressive build is appreciable. Very pollo.
I don’t think I’d even care at this point if he secretly goes creative mode once in a while. I wouldn’t want to do this shit even in creative mode.
If you see this I hope ur having a good day (unlike those villagers)
Wow, your dedication to doing... whatever you're doing... is very entertaining!
Bro chill, that's just too much
Definitely one of the greatest sand-placers ever
The best Nether hub.
Torches would have been much better
cool vid
When Ghast Hunting Compilations??
you should make a series where you can only use bugs
OH MY GOD KOLANII UPLOADED A NEW VIDEO YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hey kolanii can we get a playlist of the music you use for your videos?
.e
Fair enough
https://youtube.com/@quotesmillionaire46
https://youtube.com/@quotesmillionaire46
the way you bring these ideas to life is super inspiring!! you're crushing it Kolanii 🔥
i'm scared.
Next he's just gonna replace an ocean with a lave lake
i miss the old zombie pigmen
17:11 got me offgaurd
normal people: just use wool and blue blocks kolanaii: no
.
early and only comment                                                                                                                                                                                          pls like if read
That piglin almost ended it all
You can also use kelp to move water as it makes the flowing water a source block
Your poor pick axe
Dude has the most impressive hard core world ever
Watch the full video here https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k66Vkihwq85708b2FzpZeYp0TcGe_O2_I
Look at deep slate and dried mud
Yun
I love his humer!
ocean in the nether is cool but im still surprised your time machine worked when it was half blown up.
Its funny when he is in the water, you cant tell he’s in the nether 😂 Good job!
did you notice that the coal ore you mined with your cursed pickaxe outputted 2 ores instead of the 1 it was supposed to
Its an easy tutorial!    The tutorial: 12:37
@kolanii make 300 days skyblock or do another cave only 100 days
u know that there is a way in 1.19.2 to get water in the nether right?
I shoudnt be watching this...
The idea is basically a cursed meme you'd see on Reddit but the finished project turned out looking really cool
Bro this guy is literally gru he steals very questionable and insane things “im gonna take this whole coral reef” ima steal this village” “im literally gonna steal an ocean and put it in the nether
Call the ocean “the Red Sea” and same for island
13:25 Cant have anything in detroit
better than the overworld that wadzee built in the nether
Kolanii i suck at building any tip for pro building
make the nether in the overworld
im crying for you 😭
WHY….
The past few videos have been so unique and something I’ve never seen done before it’s very entertaining keep up the good work!
why did u even do this why didnt u quit? bro........
It’s not a kolanii video without absurd amounts of suffering.
10:45 it's not sarcasm it's irony sorry it's just I got annoyed when I said that sorry again for this comment
My man didn’t think once about a bucket 💀
Make an ocean monument inside the ocean haha dont do it you will die
I was 23 hours late  🏿🏿🏿🏿🏿🏿🏿🏿 🏿🏿🏽🏽🏽🏽🏿🏿 🏽🏽🏽🏽🏽🏽🏽🏽 🏽⬜⬛🏽🏽⬛⬜🏽 🏽🏽🏽🏿🏿🏽🏽🏽 🏽🏽🏿🏽🏽🏿🏽🏽 🏽🏽🏿🏿🏿🏿🏽🏽‍‍
YAY NEW UPLOAD
“grab a villager”
If I was him my finger will probably go to heaven
this guy is such a w
mad respect
How do you place beds in the nather?
You're always building massive projects. I recommend to build whole farlands in your world
wow dude , like for real wow........  we all know that these vids are not easy to make , with all the time effort and love put in to them , and bro i just wanna say that this is such good work and i love your videos so much man , please keep up the amazing work
this feels so wrong. just casualy placing water in nether
I love your about to destroy your mouse!
Good video, unfortunatly i am inside your walls
Putting the ocean in the nether is an accurate representation of "a glitch in the matrix"
The combination of your voice , your character , your jokes and your ideas , makes you one of my favorite YouTubers
Man you have earend my respect
Why does Kolanii like to make himself suffer-? 💀
When you are building in the water, it looks like the overworld 😂
3hr old
This guy kinda sounds like Wisp
He could just use tnt to break the glowstone
The LGIO of Minecraft.
Possible can't water nether because super hurt
Build a proper time muschine
12:00 latrop rehten
LoL So much effort?
FBI OPEN UP........ YOU ARE UNDER LIFE SENTENCE FOR BREAKING THE LAWS CREATED BY THE MINECRAFT GODSSSSSS
For some e Reason watching people break the game is satisfying
The amount of dedication that something like this takes is insane. This mans willpower and ability to finish what he starts is fucking terrifying. Subscribed.
I love you because when it was 1977 you diffused a bomb and saved my family
What a goofy ahh video
Not gunna lie his vids are insane
Bro just like a 💀
"you look like you need a day off" xD
11:15
ever since the 3rd video he is literally my favorite mc youtuber and he still does not fail to impress
This is so cool!
can you spend 100 days in the end or nether????
I saw this video somewhere 🤔
This man has never heard of any other game than minecraft
Thats cursed
This had to of taken like 7 months
POV you are his world
this is the true definition of yoiu can do anything
What a good day. Another Kolanii video
An paradise in hell
Okay how can we get this guy more subs because he needs it
Did man just build a bridge out of a villagers house
Life finds a way
Hello
Where the f*** did all that sand came from? Hahaha
Ah yes my favorite phases 3,6 and 8 (6:43)
kolani : ignore that  kolani ; i broke the game :)
house out of wood like every normal person? what a waste! just dig into a mountain and you have your base
Is it just me that thinks he sounds like that unhinged science teacher guy on TikTok
this video triggered me
I love this guy because the effort is 🤯
finally a new videoooo
Well… that’s 19 minutes for you this month..
If you need to move water in the nether you can water log stairs and push them with pistons if that’s useful
Bro, i was to lazy to even click create world
Sea Grass And Water Seems Non Realistic In The Nether. But If This Is My world I Would Say I MADE THIS?! HOW DID I EVEN MAKE THIS. THIS IS THE NETHER. HOW.
11:46 I choked on my water lmao
great job !!!!!!
Nice video, it’s pretty cool.
his ability to play and keep his sanity for hours as well as is ability to build things and them destroy themis unmatchable
Honestly I was hoping for a custom nether wood and black stone village in the build. I love this illegal stuff series and hopefully we get more content like this
when i saw the thumbnail i was thinking of 21w03a when glow lichen turned lava into water but this might be even cooler! lovely video
i saw this an instantly thought "well its time for more downgrading"
You fucking terrify me but also amaze me, your dedication Is amazingly admirable!
howwwww
Villagers invade nether and make combat golems there because pigmen sell nether's natural resources for gold instead of emeralds
Every kolanii upload is a very visible happiness moment to me.
2:43 you can brek the spawners for a lot of xp
A word of advice: you can't break glowstone quicker with any tool (including pick). It just wastes ur durability.
best youtuber
You know its a good day when kolanii makes a video.
Kolanii is very cool   Ogu approved
nice upload schedule dude
Appreciate
That ilegal you need to do a giant Nether castel just sayng
OMG THE BOSS FINALLY RETURNED
ohio.
Love ya vids Kolanii!
Can you make the roof blue so it looks like the overworld but it is actualy the ne5her?
This is the most cursed thing in the world
"Now we're gonna steal this reef, just steal the entire reef"  - British museums
Always a good day when Kolanii posts
What about the philipines its a bunch of island floating in the ocean :/
Nice videos bro, never disappoint.  Oh and if you end up reading this I have a suggestion for a confusing prank on the lifesteal smp just be extremely nice to Clown and your goal is to make him your friend then... propose to him in a romantic place (in game of course) and eventually get him to marry you in game, then take off your armor for the wedding and kill him on a stage with a large audience, obviously you'll have a status chamber and someone to pull you once your married #killed him. Be a amazingly viral video, and it'll be hilarious 😂
This is absolutely amazing! You are a top G
They declined the village because they only accept naturally spawned villages 16:47
are you australian???
How does this guy not go insane after all this? 😂😂
how are you making a time machine
I know there are people thatll accuse U of cheating but its fucking entertaining, good Video, yeah No i Like it
I think why it's snowing is beacuse it changed to a snow biome in the update
Not sure if you did this but you could use seaweed in the 1.13 versions to make your life so much easier
Seeing water and the netherrack together makes my brain hurt beyond comprehension…
❤❤❤❤
2:18 my eyes are burning help me
IMPOSSIBLE! YOU CAN'T JUST ADD OCEANS IN THE THE NETHER JUST THE BUCKET!
Silk touch and fortune? So you break It, you drop 2 blocks You break One of the 2 and you get 2 more blocks?  How does that...? Ok
Colour me impressed.
I love all of your videos ❤️
Why are there two regret life choices in your plan
16:07  My brain: he's gonna click the bed  Me: surely not he kn.... Ok fine
That's cool Kolanii
I really wanna run around in this world myself xD world download perhaps?
“You know what is not looking good? These big big big” Kolanii.exe has stopped working
get a conduit for your ocean and also the villagers might go through your portal so be careful of that
HEH.EXPLAIN YOUR CRIMES
Test
The block edits hurt my eyes but they are TOO COOL
You should get replay mod, like a timelapse shot of you putting the reef in the nether from above would look sickk
*Can we appreciate the time and effort he puts into his videos ?* 😍❤️
I was promised a dolphin, and there’s none in that ocean, That’s clickbait.  Kolanii, For the sake of accuracy you have to introduce a dolphin into the nether ocean, lol. 🥲
cursed
Its all wierd
I like this guy vid
I really love hour videos
Well, that’s one way to make a warm ocean
I set fire to things
My man's built a whole ocean in the nether before he built himself an official house 😅
Now put the nether in the ocean
Why is the fbi not doing something?
Think you spent 3 week
babe wake up kolanii uploaded a new video
What?? HOW?????
Now that I’m home from my vacation I come home to a new vid WWW
This was a really cool and interesting video
I would live there
This only took Kolanii ONE MONTH to think of the idea, come up with a way to do it,  place/break thousands of blocks, decorate a huge area perfectly, and edit many hours of footage so that it is really entertaining. 👏
Make a illegal armour for you and enchant with curse of binding so you cannot ti take it of but add some illegal enchant ments all the protection on the game so you never gonna die on this world
i love how he's not like building a nether in the overworld but he's actually bringing water to the nether
9:12 Mario sunshine boat
Hi
just need some drowned😂
I’m scared to know what the next video is
Classic
He kinda sounds like DanTDM
The Mojang FBI is knocking at your door.And checking you hardcore world for the illegal stuff.
… wtf
Mojang joined the chat
Did not know this was possible pretty incredible
The fact that this man has over 1 million subs with less than ten vids is a true testament to his production quality.
My man, King, Legend, Giga Chad, we are worried for your continued health. Why must you torment yourself like this?
Bro your are the great 👌
ur a maniac
Can we pleaseeee appreciate how much effort he puts in 🥲amazing
beff jezos
The skeleton meme is one of the songs in the
The nether looks good with water, kind of relaxing
It's a good day when kolanii uploads
Here is a challenge for you can you make a minecraft mansion made of oak wood!
bro I havent even watched i t yet and wtf is this title
You could also do this is a specific 1.17 snapshot that allows you to replace a 1x1 hole that you first fill with lava, then place one glow lichen, and then a bucket of water. This will replace the lava even in the nether.
do you think you can put a world copy in the description
This reminds me of Minecraft Pie, played on the computer that my dad set up a very long time ago, the only difference was you had to code in water!
It’s like Australia
12:29 I like how he's one hit away from dying yet he acts causal about it
Did you know that in bedrock edition water changes color not only based on books but also based on dimension, so in the end it's purple and in the nether it's red
https://youtube.com/c/Kolanii
You are the illegal man
yassssss new vid
This both sound cursed and enjoyable
what about the potions?
Instant classic as always and these older versions of Minecraft are just producing some amazing stuff. I love a lot of Hardcore Let's Plays but yours is the only one I will just randomly quote. I look forward to the continued exploits in this series as you continue to bend reality.
This mans gotta be on a minecraft employees hit list by now
"a 1x1 nether portal cus we couldn't fit in a normal sized one" Awh hell nah wtf man
The name of the hardcore series should be called illegal hardcore.
Bro worth the wait for these videos
5:56 that pew is killing me 😂 god tier editing right there
i am worried about your health
U are legend
Props to this guy if I were to do this I would quit in the first 5 minutes
Ok so at 8:31 there is lava flowing directly into the ice. Ice melted, so it's water... there isn't any obsidian tho... poor game is trully broken (loved the video btw, as always)
You could have used tnt to blow up the center glowstones
use shaders please!
Pether Nortal okay, fully enchanted feather-falling armor okay, BuT an OcEan in the NetHer that's awesome!!
For some reason I cant tell if he's talented or just plays way too much Minecraft.
12:39 One of the greatest heists of all time
I’m actually amazed at how much effort he put’s into theses videos.
I made a huge mistake I wasn’t subbed
Definition of: The things we get ourselves into.
The humor somehow seems a tad different in this one, he just didn’t do pauses and kept quickly skipping from one sentence to the next. Not a negative critique per say, I prefer fast speaking, but the commentary seemed rushed…perhaps the build was so massive and you really wanted to get a vid out.
Next : build a base in the void
This is the best Minecraft video I've watched in a while! Your voice, mixed with the music, sound and jump cuts, is wildly entertaining! Good stuff!
It will be fine...   It wasn't
Use moss carpet to prevent mob spawning and or string
props man, you rode the 100 days trend, but instead of dying out, you make your own original intresting content, keep up the good work :)
Kolanii, I think i speak for everyone when I say we are generally concerned for your mental health. every video gets cooler and cooler and your will to get out of bed in the morning must be utterly shagged. like if you all agree pls.
Who else first came to this channel on the playing Minecraft correctly video.
Actually insane! Crazy
He really just said Alr time to make just some monuments
NEXT VID MAKE A MEDIEVAL CASTLE IN A MODERN CITY
How do u do this I can’t even place a 5x5 wall without getting bored
Bro is the definition of making the impossible possible
what
14:49 ok
Can you do illegal or rare animals
This video truly does deserve the "lets Just apreciate the effort he puts in his videos" comments
I am scared of this man
Wait why does your ocean not have any fish?
WHY DID YOU KILL THE PIGS
Yooooo
Now what? Walking to the nether world border in the void?
Let's go
This is one of those things that’s so unnecessary yet so necessary at the same time😂😂 keep up the good work Kolanii
10:42 you can see a drowned there
Unlike the extremely loud, annoying and sometimes cringe Minecraft Hardcore YouTubers, you set the bar high with quality content and interesting videos. Keep them coming!
ok ok i truly agree why  your videos take like 2 months to make. this right here is pefect explanation for it  =D
those villagers litterally live in ohio lmao
next episode can you make an armor set and have all port 4 things on it.  (did not just steal this from a youtuber) all you need to do is to go back in a update and to it. i think i saw this in sb737
Pls stop taking risk I do t want u dying
years that he cant get back...
Bro asnt another level up from wadzee
If I tried to do any of this I 1. Would have died already and 2. Would have given up after the first ghast
Why didn’t you just go to the version where water spreads infinitely
Kolanii : Blink once if you dont want me to steal your house The villager : *Zzzz...*  The morning...  Kolonii : alrght just need the floor now  The villager : *AYO DUDE? WHERE AM I?*
You have the potential to get 10m subscribers and more with your unique concepts and your hilarious commentary-  I’m not sure if this proves you’re a mad genius or just a complete  idiot
Am I the only one who is both concerned and scared of this man like how does he get through the day- 💀💀💀         Besides playing Minecraft ofc
Huh
The legend is back
O
MOM WAKE UP KOLANII UPLOAD
man, I need to try doing this it looks like fun
gotta admit thats a smooth transition 🔥🔥
Good job Kol
Incredibly impressive
next project: I put the real life Eiffel tower in my Minecraft world
So you didn't   really get every elligal thing in Minecraft since the lava and water you cant really pick it up
See you in 2 months kolanii
ligma balls
Stop stomping in Kolaniis eggs
Maybe in a future add Moss! to make it look greener! Epic job! :>
13:23 cant have shit in detroit
Kolanii: *brings villagers to hell* As they descend: *German stuchka divebomber sounds*
12:29 you were so close to dying 😭
I love kolaniis merch
i am actually impressed this worked!
Venice
NICE VIDEO!
Minecraft slowly deleting his world
Wow wow wow wow. This is THE BEST hardcore series out there!! Very great job Kolanii!!
Honestly better than how wadzee built his overworld in the nether
Water? a Fire item? wait, that's illegal! I'm sorry to say that you broke the unofficial 10 commandments of Minecraft!
Pether nortal merch when?
@kolanii is there any way you could make your editing file available? I really want to look at it and see how you do certain edits. It would help me as a content creator
How does this not have more likes
Thanks for all you do kolanii!
Also good job :)
It is 12:40 am and I am still waching this
In the next video instead of making a lava ocean a water ocean next do the opposite and put a lava ocean in the overworld.
am i the only one who wonders… how tf does kollanni come up with these ideas?
Cool
What I love about kolani is that he says thing like "ima steal this ocean and put it in the nether"
Kolanii might just be the greatest YouTuber ever
Fuck off that’s cursed 😂 god vid
that’s illegal
I know this idea will not be very popular but, can someone plz make a video where they put every soundtrack kolanii uses?
omg kolanii posted! that never happened before!!
He absolutely didn’t realize it said silk touch 1
king of doing everything he wants
Hit something with the knock back 2 dirt, I want to see it’s power
That fact that this works is absolutly terrifying😂😂😂
Part 2 of Kolanii's curse videos
love your videos
Thanks for all the amazing videos you make You're one of the people that inspire me to keep making videos and tell a story in them
Thanks for all the amazing videos you make You're one of the people that inspire me to keep making videos and try to be like you
Can you join my world I already friended you
Question why didn't you test if that fortune and silk touch pick would help get more eggs??? I know I would've
The pether nortal really came in clutch here
Bro💀
12:40  Wow he's gonna steal this 👇
Quality over quantity
When you realize you forgot the portal item is also super illegal and should be added to your museum.
I love how he comes so close to dying when he blows up some of the nether and is just like: yeah, the world said no back
Yoooooo kolanii new videoooo
First a pether nortal and now this What is next?
from a mods perspective, we thought it would be nice to make it so that you can suffocate because of no "air", not because walls are attacking you!
i know its his job and stuff but i think i seriously would loose my mind if i did theese stuff
Glad to see you uploading at least once every month or 2. Good luck with the next video.
Kolanii: *exists* Logic: Am i a joke to you?
Make more videos
This video was actually very entertaining! Keep it up!
Less go
The ruined portal on the island should use black stone, not regular stone
Hello friend, i see that everyone talks about the effort you put in your videos and im sure they are mindblowing, but i wanted to say i just saw you on the main page and you just got yourself a follower with that cute little merch promotion at the beginning.
I remember when you were at 100K wow time goes by fast
Call Grian, NOW. ( 2:02 )
Amazing. totally illegal but amazing
you silly goose you cant do that
Kolanii has the wildest ideas of basically every Minecraft hardcore  yt
the way he one-ups every vid is impressive
Im always excited when you post
Give the villagers work stations so that they don’t run away
You can actually get water in the nether, using a specific snapshot and using the glow lichen on a lava source block
I don’t know why but ur logo reminds me of a giraffe
Why u torture URSELF like this
wait   thats illegal
even with how long it takes for him to upload each video. it never matters because its always worth the wait.!
This video is so cursed omg
Looks like burnout to me Gotta take those brakes bruh, don't go that flamy way
Yes finaly a new posted vidoe from a legend hardcore user
Make a portal to the end in the nether and nether portal in the end
I'm in complete awe with the lengths this guy goes to make content like this. Great job!
I loved when kolanii said its watering timr and then went and watered all over the nether, absolutely one of the moments of all time
Great and amazing as ever hope you make 100 days survival again like RL craft
Me with portal blocks in my 1.18 world: moving swiftly on
first a new lukethenotable video, now kollanii?, swag
Everyone drop everything, kolanii posted a video
Yes
You illegally play Minecraft without pirating it
Minecraft Devs: haha nether to hot for water so no water allowed! Kilanii: haha ocean in the actual nether. Devs: bruh
And they said it was impossible...
ngl, I kinda forgot about this channel- Glad to see you back tho!
Comment for the algorithm, cause your videos are insane.
when the world needed him most he returned
i love ur vids!
Let’s thank this man for sacrificing his sanity for our enjoyment
i love how he popped a totem and got down to 3 hearts *on a hardcore world* and just laughed and made a joke (12:26)
Man Excellent work keep it up!
Like make a ocean into lava
U should make the over world into the nether
Finally kolanii load a video but I WANT MORE VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!
And when the werld needed him most, he returns
This is so cursed
The craziest thing is that there's still a lava ocean below, volcano anybody?
the amount of details in your videos are incredible you really are the best <3
Ok
The effort on display here is astounding.
you should make it so that wherever this village and ocean were, replace that with nether stuff, just to it feels like SOMETHING swapped these two around
You should make housing for the piglins.
I always actively watch every single video Kolanii releases
This was so unbelievably cursed
nice video
I adore him for a few main reasons. The fact he sounds so calm, collected but also chaotic and like he’s about to end the Minecraft multi universe. 2. His ideas, his ideas are amazing. 3. He’s Kolanii, what isn’t there to adore?
But kolanii, if you lut a river through a island its just 2 islands
this was so well done, that i was having a hard time distinguishing between the over world and the nether
I love how you put in tons of effort placing and melting all that ice and I'm really sorry to tell you that you could have just placed two pieces of ice and melted them into water and then made a flying machine that would duplicate the water for you once you update
Claim your within a day ticket here😊
kolanii just making the most creative and cursed videos ever
This man is mentaly ill
This is so bueatiful and illegal at the same time
Kolanii reminds me of Red Guy from dhmis
You could use that pickaxe to duplicate ores.
This is extremely illegal
Next episode we going to see a guy with a dolorean coming and saying to kolanii that time travel is not good
GET THIS WEIRD ENGLISH TALKING MF TO 10MILLION BRO
12:40 Ahhh so thats where they went
always love the amount of hard work you put into your videos! always enjoyable to watch and always worth the wait, can't wait for the next episode!
New video yeees 🥳
Next video I created an illegal Minecraft world 🌎
Doing the undoable =kolanii
im disturped
wow
The ocean is now man-made good job kolanii
.                                                                                              N.     .
Gotta love this guy
This is a cursed but good Minecraft hardcore world
I already feel lazy to go chop some trees when I need wood….
Yj
He has problems in his life and needs to get some therapy
Kolanii prove that everything is possible even impossible thing
kolanii wanting us to buy merch after not posting for a year
Okay ... I thought you just had a mod who would do this ... but this is also a way
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO HUMOR IS AMAZING
Are you gonna do more back in time videos?
your dedication to your videos are insane. i love them. keep it up! ill be sure to grab me some merch
You and cookiegod should team up
we need face reveal
Glow stone Asmr?😂
Hey kolanii I just wanted to say thank you for your hard work and dedication to these videos it look great keep up the hard work
Right
WOOOOO KOLANII POSTED!!!!!
Now do hardcore terraria
how did you keep the world hardcore. i tried going back to old versions (ones before hardcore exists) on  a hardcore world from 1.19 and every time i would go back to 1.19 the world would be changed to survival
y
Are you okay?
don't you get xp from breaking spawners?
bro he makes it seem like placing 4 sea pickles in a block makes up for how little there are not to be rude though just thought it was funny
I like the pether nortal
ive been waiting for this mf to post for the past 2 months.
Can you get a panda and name it  cookie love you so much pls get that panda and pls give shutout
#waterinnetherlol
I’m so hooked love ya kolanii
for the old boats, you have to equip a shovel to move
the editing you use for these videos is amazing! i love it! super funny and creative!
Why do you do this to yourself 😢
I love these videos, not too long, addicting, and entertaining!
How does he survive underwater more that 2 seconds. I can't even place 5blocks if I tried
this was crazy I loved the intro
I felt my serotonin go up just clicking on his video, love this guy and the quality of his work
Pog ❤
Kolani: I put a lot of effort into this for the sake of the viewer. Reality Kolani:money coming quick! NO need for a job.
imagine ur just exploring the sea part and just see a ton of netherrack
Kolanii: Its absolutely massive  Me: Thats what she said   (And this is my first time watching your videos)
can you do it with shaders
How did you put water in the nether?
THE KING HAS RETURNED!
Achievement complete:kidnap a whole village to the nether
Your videos are  hilarious keep that in mind Kolanii
How does your world not curropt dude?
You should of tried to put a conduit there too
This is incredible, the ocean would be perfect for an ocean minument (small ocean monument)
Automatically a good day when kolanii post
Omg you are so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀
Such a beautiful village also
Dude is the "Let's Game It Out" of Minecraft .  This video was lovely  : ]
This man is insane, I do not think anyone would be able to do this, and that's not just because you cant place water in the nether. Your content is amazing, thanks for all the videos.
Nice kolanii
As soon as I saw this my brain accessed Dopamine
Gru: We're going to steal the moon! Kolanii: We're going to steal a reef
where is the kelp?
Ohio be like
Damn , i forgot how much i love this channel
You are probably the only Minecraft Hardcore Youtuber who pulls of such crazy ideas. Great video!
Me like how is he doing this  in survival
I literally never thought the nether could e so dark tbh I thought it was always bright
Even with the beta version item hack, the amount of work put into these vids is astounding
i wish you could just like, take a coral, put some bonemeal on it, and then boom, giant coral
why
He's back, back again, guess who's back, tell a friend, Kolanii's back
That time machine is op. Can send the link on how to build it?
Watching you when eating pie
You should put some of that stuff into the cursed museum
I love your videos so much and im so happy that im kinda early
inbetween vids i go hmm i wonder whats gonna be next and.....
kinda cold how he ate that fish at the end ngl
We were said it was impossible, and he took it as a challenge
found this by accident, but I'm lovin it.
The best hardcore series on this planet. Doing illegal things and committing genocide on the squid community. Still have ptsd about that btw.
16:06  EL bozo, That was funny
LETS GOOOO!!!   Your back. Thank you for always making me happy.
Kolani why didn’t you take the portal item from beta 1.6 in the previous video instead of using redstone to build the pether portal?
you most probably have the most cursed minecraft map ever.
you keep suprising me
Kolanii posted a video: happy days Watching the video: happy days Finished the video: it's a very sad day
You could build a pigman switch 😂
Don't you just causually steal a coral reef?
babe wake up kolanii uploaded
Kolanii disgrade hes world for the 172728181 just for a illegal thing 😂
The amount of time he allmost lost his world in this video is quite big
so true!
wssa
its the wii sports island!
ANOTHER ONE
Kolanii is so determined to have quality over quantity that he had time to do all this and edit the vid very well
you could've used torches and they would get destroyed when the ice turns into water
How do he know the redstone is white if he says every video that he is COLOR BLIND?
WAIT WATER IS ILLEGAL
hoi qualiti contunt ❤
there is more water in his nether than in africa
wow, your really putting max effort in everything, im always looking forward for your vids, its incredible!
YAY ANOTHER HARDCORE KOLANII EPISODE YYYYEEEAAAAHHH BOOOIIIIII btw love your content man, its so amazing!!
"White redstone dust" 💀
With how many thousands of hours he puts in his video his mental state is questionable But i love his video not just because of the amazing content but also his effects
Too long since last video!!! So glad you back!!🤗🤗🤗
Insane.
nether cod?!?!?!
Kolanii's videos are so great to watch if your bored or just looking for some Minecraft content :)
I just clicked on this video and i have no idea of how hes going to do that  Édit: This man is a fucking genius
kolanii, you are very charming
Tether cortal
such a great video!
This guy just put an ocean into the nether like it was nothing 💀
The amount of effort he puts into these videos is astonishing and the fact hes one of the only hardcore player who goes back to older updates is really cool.
Yay! New Kolanii upload!
Lazy mfs
This guy deserves more subscribers
nosise
Early. i love your vids, your voice is so calming!
I love your videos
Upload more
This is the most illegal thing ever and I love it
This seems so illegal
Watery grave
Lets all appreciate the amount of effort he puts into his videos. Amazing job, keep up the work!
Lets all appreciate the amount of effort he puts into his videos. Amazing job, keep up the work!

Lets all appreciate the amount of effort he puts into his videos. Amazing job, keep up the work!
KOLANII IS ALIVE
wait how did he get all of the glowstone he never explained that
you should fill it with millions of squids
Just break the glowstone with frost walker
Wait, Thats illegal
Kolanii
This channel has grown so much
my man did the impossible
this hurts my brain
You should name this series “Breaking all Minecraft Rules cuz why not”
You didn’t need to place that much ice, a thin diagonal line would fill it https://youtu.be/hANZ78_T4c4 21:20
Hi Kolanii! Epic video. Can you please explain how to do this because the versions you use arnt in the launcher. Thanks
Others: massive builds Kolanii: ocean in nether
love you
9:16
6:09 300 000 blocks of sands at a speed of 3 block / second => 100 000 seconds to place all of it, so 1666 hours (and not 27h) or 69 days (nice) ?      (yeah I'm annoying but I'mseeing that now that I'm rewatching this video cause it's just so good)
This guy has the most cursed hardcore world ever
The house made of every block actually looks nice
that's  Amazing ❤❤🔥
I swear that thumbnail is genuinely cursed 💀
Me on google:- "How to waste your entire life ?" .  . Google- "Become a hardcore minecraft youtuber."
bruh, my brain hurt
He could’ve used tnt to get rid of the glow stone faster 😅
The island would look better with moss blocks for grass and azalea leaves because the have the same color in every biome
Normal players: Trying to survive in the nether  Kolanii: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaHPZ4c1QE
me when clicked this video: OCEAN IN NETHER WHAT
Next video will be “I copied my entire world in the end dimension in Minecraft hardcore.”
The best part of the video was getting the villagers and the cattle
Am I the only one who thinks kolanii should have built the pether nortal out of the nether portal block
Piglins:HEY WHY IS THERE GROSS WATER INSIDE OUR BEAUTIFUL LAVA LAND. TIME TO DESTROY THE DOORS- Kolanii:(places eggs) Piglins:UNDERSTANDABLE HAVE A NICE DAY
IM.. IMPOSSIBLE!!
You spelled initiate wrong at 6:50
aren't you that singer?
16:04
boffy meets wadzee  amazing
How did he place beds in thr nether for the villager farm.
Cool!
Man these kolanii videos are part of the only reasons I still watch Minecraft content
Good  gas
11:15 looks kinda sus not going to lie
Lol “oh your asleep good idea” love your videos
You can put moss block instead of grass blocks it looks nice in colour and is also green in the nether
your vids are amasink but pls release them quicker (i wonder what notification they send you when you get pinned)
imagine buinding an aceon monument temple in the ocean in the nether
Love the content!
big fan kolanii!!! tysm for the awesome and fun videos!!!!
I will report you to the local authorities.
Yes another one I’ve been waiting but it makes sense he puts so much effort
Seeing how big his projects for literally each videos are. If he's not uploading for a long time, and you ever wonder where is Kolanii... You can be almost 100% sure this dude is probably placing blocks in Minecraft, making another project.
I love this guy this guy is amazing 😂😂😂😂😂😂 * dieing from laugh *
Kolanii breaks the game so much its amazing
Now i know how people make those really cursed minecraft videos
Kolanii U MUST DO THESE VIDEOS MORE OFTEN!!! 1 VIDEO PER 2 MONTHS IS SO SMALL AMOUNT
"no they're stomping on my eggs" 😐
10,000 IQ Dream: turn random strider into crazy nether MLG 10,000 IQ Kolanii: turn nether lava into MLG pool
Great video, Kolanii :D
next put a nether in the ocean
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW HE JUST CASUALLY ALMOST DIES 12:27
The all of the countries and Earth into your Minecraft world
I was wondering where your next video was and then I saw the title and was like "Oh yeah that makes sense"
so everyone complimenting this dude so much but we are forgetting the fact that he managed to spend hours for us and did the impossible.  *WATER IN THE NETHER*
This man is criminal
What do you think about your work Kolanii? Proud or just why?
you r hilarios
"Just a basic Minecraft house really"
break the bedrock above add the wolrd upside down :D
Kolanii videos make everyone happy.                    Unless you are hydrophobic
=gg =well played =deserved
They way I laughed when the bed exploded 🤣
The island outline looks like amongus
cursed
this video is crazy
This guy is one of the best mc yt ever
The ideas his humour editing the efforts everything just top notch
This is beautiful. I needed this.
Uhm kolanii you ok after this my guy?

And when we needed him most, he posts
YAYAYAY KOLANII IS UPLOADING SO MUCH
Alr boys, this is the Kolanii video we gonna get for the next 3 months
Bro called ocean ruins ocean monuments and I thought he was going to build an ocean monument and add guardians and like an elder guardian or something
Ssaasssyyy the chicken
I suddenly remember why you upload so irregularly
0:00, NO! REALLY?
13:44 i'm pretty sure you can push a waterlogged fence with a piston to move water, just move some water from the ocean!
Glow stones: the amount of spiders in Australia
great video but pls put some kelp in your ocean
Love ya vids man
Evryting is just so random that’s so funny
12:30 Him just casually being on 1 and a half hearts on hardcore without a totem and doest even care.
Average in Ohio
Bro you're crazy lmfao
do full video of the process
Man you can't have shit in detroid
lets take a moment to apreciate the time spent into this just to entratain us
Best feeling when your sat watching a Kolanii video after a long day wearing his merch.
Boooo get rid of the subtitles pleaseee
Im honestly speechless with your videos, you come up with the most unique and incredible videos ever! Absolutely love this one, again!
Put some fences or stone walls around the village
Apples
That’s really cool
Bruh
2:01 This defineitly gonna be in the Top 10 Basic Minecraft Houses

The most cursed world award goes to kolanii !!
Alternative title: Building the Netherlands in minecraft

Kolanii I gotta warn you, all your villagers and animals are gonna wander through that portal. They have a knack for finding portals and escaping across dimensions. You might wanna fence gate it or something
Nice merch
How the fuck
Haha 🤣
Yooo finaly a vid 🎉
he won't pin this
Mojang: You can't place water in the nether Kolanii: Aight bet
You should have made the island out of moss instead of grass looks nicer
Pether nortal XDD
This is so cursed. I’m really worried for his world right now. 😐. It’s gonna break
This man should be on Hermitcraft and you cannot convince me otherwise
Watching this with McDonald’s. Yay

This man has to be sick if he uploaded
W
Yoiur every block MANSION is hillarious😂
love u
The effort you put in your videos is insane. This was a Great video!
babe wake up Kolanii posted
This is so many levels of wrong
Kolanii I am an aspiring YouTuber and you are my favorite one. If there is any way you could help me out my Chanel is GrimStar67❤❤❤
I will have depression if he dies on this amazing world
Noice one
prime example of colonization and assimilation
First
MORE, MORE,MORE!!!  Is there going to be a 300 days to the ocean days?
13:26 i like how you broke the bed last like "yep, im gonna take ya' bed too"
LETS GO YOU UPLOADED
There’s no real point he just does illegal things cause he can
Only Kolanii can say he's caught and ate a fish he caught in the nether.
Finally another kolanii video this man deserves more subs
"how and why" lmaoooo
I see a kolanii video, I click.
Post more illegal stuff
i love this guy
FINALLY KOLANII HAS UPLOADED {Happiness}
The irs wants to know your address
evrything looks so wrong
1 hour ago
He made a desert in the nether, then he made an ocean
I was so happy when I saw that you uploaded❤
This is a channel worth 5 million subscribers
Nah man you deserve more god hame mercy in your sleep routine
Great video! I’m glad your continuing the series of doing illegal things.
Kolanii you're like a mad genius. I mean who thinks of this stuff and then executes it so perfectly??
Nether inhabitants be like:Who isthisguy and why is he tarraforming our world?
Dec 5 th your hard-core world will end
the other
Niceee broooo
Is an ocean in the nether a warm ocean?
epic
Kolanii I love your vids so much and this one was great but can you please make some more 100 days I love those or a continuation of them?
pre 3k sub gang? anyone else?
i missed his last video so now i have two kolanii videos in one day :D
This is better than Thanksgiving, a Kolanii upload.
No doubt about it that this must have been absolute p a I n.
dude I never knew that you could bonemeal sand underwater to make sea grass and stuff
The commitment to the bit is, as always, fucking insane. Best hardcore Minecraft series out there.
W
Ok
Wut
nobody talking about how clean the outro elytra shot was
This man both concerns me and impresses
I could never do this in creative
Those we some nice smooth stone and grass blocks at 0:54. My brother and I also enjoyed making cursed sharpness 5 porkchops and dueling
53 minuts
You are the best
Yes
The amount of effort put into this is unreal
Love it
The amount of dedication is epic.
I’m scared of this man
You never fail to amaze me
Kolanii stealling entire villages and coral reefs, next thing you know he's gonna be stealing an end city to put in his backyard
literally every part of this video was hilarious and showed some dedication plus unlike a lot of my favorite minecraft players he actually knows a lot
10:20 The song name plsss
I love your content Kolanii
H-How is his patience… I…
Only Kolanii can make something like this happen
y do people dis like this what do you not like?
I think he's the first person to ever do this in a hardcore series
please tell me you made at least 100 backups of your hardcore world-
this is wrong
Konali being sarcastic is so anoying
320th
I have an exam today, and I should be studying. But kolani video comes first
Hiiii
Ok, it is not just for imagining only
We have seen the limits of the universe at this point.
youre actually insane and i love it
NASA could hire this Kolanii to terraform mars, he'd do it in one video.
when kolanii posts the world is cured of depression.
Your back 🎉 this better be a good video
First hour club 👀
Its curse and cool at the same time
12:44 I was expecting an amogus ngl kinda disappointed but happy
Hi
YES U UPLOADED
It's a great day
Come Hell AND High Water
When Kolanii posts on your birthday :D
In 40 min
I honestly enjoyed this video
Is it possible to learn this power?
Love to see you back hope you're doing great👍
My poor brain
hello back kolanii ❤
Babe wake up, new kolanii video
This is a certified Thete moment
the nether in ohio
hi kolanii
this was already a good day. this video upgraded it to a great day!
that is a worrying amount of seaweed
You should build a mob switch
“Oh your asleep sounds like a good idea”  Proceeds to kill a family
Definitely my favourite YouTuber
Stel a reef? If like u to try  Then i remembered his determination and sorry reef
The things you do for content bro
Hi
12:35 🥲I hate my mind,  send help!
thats so cursed ;-; but epic in a good way
its been a long time , but its worth it : quality > quantity
i love youre videos. The amount of efford you put into this is insane!
Early great vid btw kolani
That was really fun to watch. Cool idea 👍
the amount of times he can just say he's done and people will be happy, but just adds more details is so crazy
Unbelievable!! I never imagined water in the nether.
Sometimes Kolanii just does the impossible
HALLO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. MAN
Istg if his next video is him placing a nether portal in the end, he'll officially be the most cursed hardcore player out there
Awesome.
How much does kolanii hate himself?
I watch your videos before sleeping, glad theres new content to watch :)
bro ate at the end a HELL FISH lol
Another banger upload
I have no idea where you get your ideas from....but I love them!
Minecraft: So there's only a couple rules. One is that you can't place water in the nether, that wouldn't make sense, it's too hot for it!  Kolanii: So anyway, I started time traveling
wait till he finds out he could have just gone back to a 1.17 snapshot when lichen was added to get water in the nether than you could spread easily 💀
wow 27 mins ago
You chose blink once cuz that’s something a villager can’t do
Made Minecraft history congrats. And love your l videos it is consistently confusing me.
Kolanii: I have so many illegal things. Next morning: FBI! Open up!
I cant stop laughing about how Kolanii went "oh youre asleep, good idea" and just right clicks the bed  Kolanii RIGHT CLICKED the bed, TWICE
uhh
Kolanii I love your vids and it’s a great day when you upload because if all of the time and effort you put into videos. One thing that I would love to see is a 300 days on the one block or ocean world
yay kolanii is back
He did it again
imagine if mojang seeing this and it's like "Impossible"
one question JUST HOW
THE NETHER
I have never been this early, ever
Minecraft: we made the most perfect game ever only a little many glitches ahh so perfect Kolani: I am gonna break every one of them
its sad that the illegal museum doesnt lead to the illegal ocean. like really, imagine if the pether nortal linked up to the illegal ocean.
i didnt know that the ocean would look so good in the lava world
I wonder how you time travel maybe with a launcher I really love your videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you broke the law in Minecraft❤❤🫀
Always the best content who does everything without pain and risks LOL
My guy put an ocean in the nether?!
you could have used tnt for the glowstone breaking
I was having a kolanii withdrawal; so glad you're back
hello
It just keeps getting better and better
HOLY MOLYY EARLY AMD WHAT A BUILD AS WELL
this is actually amazing
I waited for this for so long
Bro almost died lmao😂
the amount of time kolanii took only to make an ocean in hell just proves that he has nothing to do with his time
I think ur next episode should be "I built a bedrock ________ in hardcore Minecraft!" (replace blank with house, town, structure, whatever object u wanna make idrc)
The most scuffed thing I have ever seen but I love the effort he puts into these :)
Just wow this guy defies the laws of Minecraft physics
ok so you basically committed 100 Minecraft crimes during this video... Nice!
Me “playing a game thats online and kolanii finally uploads,ME QUITS GAME AND WATCHES” 😂
6:42 Remember, in Phase 7, you have to make the ocean with the most regretful tears. Just sad tears won't work
Ayy finally, the legend uploads
will watch but not rn
Kolanii just posted 🙏
Add more fish
I love your vids
17 mins ago!?
Mimecraft: you cant break this game without exploits/cheats Kolanii: no
yoooo
this video is just getting more and more illegal
Just came home from a very tiring 9 hours, this video was what i needed, thanks!
KOLANNII I MISSED YOU SO MUCH IM SO HAPPY
2:20 these textures are so nostalgic
yooo 15 minutes early!!! love your videos :)
The amount of effort he puts in his videos is actually insane
Finally I was waiting so long
The amount of effort he puts into his videos is both worrying and impressive.
uploading another banger
YES HE UPLOADED
Kolanii :D
It's so nice watching you make illegal things happen
How has your pc not died yet?
Me when I saw the video: that’s impossible!
new video:DDDDD
I loved the part where he said it's kolanin time and kolaniied all over the nether
Wait thats illegal
Quality over quantity
Yohhhh kolanii new video again thanks for the content ☺️
Yes
Ur 1 of the best youtubersss EVER
IM NEVER DISSAPOINTED🙃
omg hes alive :o
I love this channel
Finally I’ve been waiting for this. I was watching every single hardcore video by kolanii waiting for so long it was just fine.
Yass Kolanii is here again after a month!!
You should get every illegal mob texture like the librarian and pigmen.
Jesus nine minutes ago and it already has 150 comments
When Kolanii uploads thats a W Day W Kolanii
Omg he really uploaded in 30 minutes
so many likes in 9 minutes 😲😲
Just imagine you’re just a Zombified Piglin going about your day, and then some random dude began extinguishing and terraforming parts of your home dimension just to put an entire ocean and structures from his home dimension.
The content turned out to be great, keep it up. 😉
fantastic.
Kolanii be like (ok let’s just do everything impossible possible
Hi
Haven't even watched the video yet and my 2 questions are 1. How? & 2. Why?
something good to watch :)
I was about to search for a youtube video to watch, and then i saw that Kolanii uploaded. Never switched my mind so quickly
I love this
EEEEEEEE

Glitching water into the Nether. Typical Kolanii upload.

The ideas get crazier each time 😂
Wow he uploaded in 30 mins☺...        SMEEEEEEEEESH LIIIIIKEE

Love when you upload. Love your content
Yes
Wake up babe, new kolani upload

Every video you put out is always worth the wait! Thanks for making me laugh every time, Kolanii.
Gud vid
O my godness yes 😍😍
He is somehow monotone and happy sounding at the same time
Good good😊
If you press the gas a brake pedal in your car at the same time, it'll take a screenshot.
i immediately stopped playing and went to yt when i saw u upload
Hmm why is the video only in 360p?
I was waiting...thx
here before 10mil views
Kolanii if you make this i will scream-you should make a museum where basically every block is in it, than you should put whatever you can craft with that item next to it. Like armor and weapons and stuff. I think that would be very cool.
KOLANII UPLOAD LES GO
