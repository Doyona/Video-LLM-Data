If there are some parts where the video is muted it is unfortunately because I got hit by copyright
0:36 Pokémon mention?! 0:50 years later, I finally learnt what was the "Tifa and Italy" meme
i am not ready to see Made in Abyss 2 . i do not think i will ever be ...
Why is it that you can go out at night in japan and not get stabbed? Might it have something to with with a certain government policy about foreigners?
What a fantastic video. Thank you!
22:39 can someone please tell the name of the soundtrack used here
I thought gigguk hated Bocchi lol
Made in Abyss 2 was an undeniable metaphor for the child growing up in a war zone.   Because there isn’t a year that goes by where this isn’t happening - timeless
24:51 had me rolling🤣
What is the name of the OST in made in abyss in 27:28
Multiple ads in the part where you ask the viewer to listen to the Made in Abyss music sucks. lol
3 years later goddamn 2022 was fucking stacked
R.I.P Angry Rantman
SIEMPRE VUELVO A ESTE VIDEO  PARA RECORDAR LO BUENO QUE FUE ESTE AÑO PARA EL ANIME , ALMENOS PARA MI   Pero mas para que mi corazon se retuerza en este momento 27:14 27:42   Definitivamente Gigguk cocino una bella secuencia , solo le falto colocar a MAAA y romperia mi corazon al instante💔
someone know what is the anime in 10:44 ? thx
how does he do it, from making me burst out laughter to having a genuine look at myself only to immediately throw me through a loop of yet another joke that has me rolling to then again making me have a really deep think, how i say how?
10:08  omg its 3 am
"Gay girls innit"🗣🗣
I mean bro what the fuck why do you only watch slice of life snoozefests I WANT BLOOD, TRIUMP DOMINATION AND DEATH. I DONT WANNA WATCH AN IDOL SING???
The crazy thing is, I never got into Demon Slayer or Kaguya-sama. I watched the first episode of both and they didn't really grab me, so every time there's a sequel and people want to hype it up and say the shows are a masterpiece, I don't really connect with it
23:07  yea the game was shit I agree with the author . Cool game she said 16
I watched this video again in 2024 and I still started crying  when I heard the Cyberpunk edgrunners song.
10:19 exactly why i am learning japanese so i can get the hell out.
where is kingdom it was the best anime in 2022
LIAM HOW DO YOU KNOW MY BEST FRIENDS COUSINS DAD's FRIENDS NAME!
15:31 sounds like the giga chad theme
You almost made me watchlist the golf's anime, but i think Happy Gilmore was enough, as golf experience! 😂
I love watching garnt passionately talk about anime that I've never heard of
i got fucking chills when I heard I really wanna stay at your house
Liam Rn:
u made a 2022 best anime list and there is no mention of "kotaro lives alone". I genuinely first liked the video then disliked it. Kotaro is one of the best animes I have watched.
I don't trust this list or this guy.
that liam caught me off guard
HOW DID HE KNOW MY NAME WAS LIAM!??!?!?!?!?!??!
God brought us CloverWork in 2022, and the world changed ever since.
sadly, the anime that got me into romance was high school dxd. idk if that counts, but it kinda does. idk, its horibble when they ask me my first anime
this guy called his wedding 'the biggest climax of his romance arc'
Me watching this at 6:30 AM an hour after I woke up
No. 17 intro was hilarious 😂😂😂
Why is there is no Bleach TYBW
how dare you put in I want to stay at your house... sadge
That cyberpunk song is PTSD now
I have an obsession I know one piece spy x family Naruto boruto demon slayer jujutsu kaisen my hero academia hunter x hunter that’s all 😂❤
How dare you put spy family at 8 14:13
i used to value your taste in anime but damn it got bad.  one third is bullshit shounen like my hero academia one third is weird bullshit that only stands out for beeing weird but not beeing good and almost a third of anime that is just bland. like blue lock for example. you advertised it as an anime that is different for a change, with a protagonist that is an egoist which is VERY rare. but its not. they only talk like edgelords all the time, but arent really egoists. the strategy talk is total bullshit like some dude passing and then they analyze it for half an hour as a genius move where they used their opponent... no, it was just a pass. and they keep teleporting all over the field. the show is TOTAL bullshit.
a good metric for anime is: the more girls are in the named cast, the worse it is. there are exceptions but usually its the pandering animes that hope cute girls substitute an actual plot, and harem anime. and those suck hard
Alright, fuck you Gigguk, I didn't need that emotional attack with Edgerunners.
What's the soundtrack or title of the song used for the Made in Abyss part? The sound has stayed in my mind all week
25:37 I just realized the smooth transition from mobs ending op "One" and the start of 1st the this anime ranking. Great editing
For real.. Ash did it so hm
I'm watching this in 2024 because I watched alot of anime in 2022 and I'm re-watching the ones I enjoyed but I've forgotten most of them
I learn new english word. "Prat". Thank you!
10:07 not me watching at 6 AM
wtf it’s 3 am fr
made in abyss lesgooo
Gay girls innit
My favorite anime of 2022 are Chainsaw Man, Spy X Family and Legend of Vox Machina.
Tomodachi game deserves a spot in this genuinely a amazing show
😮
i swear to god, in anime, the horror anime is never ever scary. but the none horror anime, like made in abyss is so so horrific
God damn 2022 had so many heavy hitters! The final season of Mob Psycho was so good and I'm so sad that I'll never see it again, but at least it got a wholesome ending that I absolutely love. Cyberpunk Edgerunners was also so damn good, and whenever I hear the ending song I get so emotional because the story is so good and sadly it's so short. CSM was something that got so much hype, that I was so hyped for it, and I never even heard of it before, and after watching it, the hype is makes sense. Demon Slayer's visuals are actually so good and I love the whole vibe of season 2 with most stuff being at night and all the flashing lights, the lighting just pops! Spy x Family was such a nice and wholesome watch, nothing bad to say about it, and I can't wait for the next season!
Mob psycho is still the best anime I’ve ever seen
gigguks description tells me why I love te anime I love frfr
Spoiler:        If you plan on watching my dress up darling just don’t, it’s a pile of shit just like that miss nagatoro one
Damn Gik its 2:58 am dont call me out like that. Guess i gotta watch it 😂
Just finished made is the abyss it was goated
What's worse than an anime being locked behind Disney+? An anime being locked behind Hulu. Frickin' Hulu!
My name is Liam and it's 4am...I feel very seen
What is the song that plays in the background from 24:35-25:12?
What is the music at 22:37 ?
Top 3 are all extremely BASED choices
made in abyss changed me as a person
It's actually 3 am so i just wanna say gigguk is Rent a Girlfriend actually good😮
Is it just me bc audio cut out at the spy family part?
Song at 23:32?
Ah, that's the whole point of K-ON... The girls all realize they need to get things done but all prefer and end up  snacking on cake and tea
the art style, is what i call it but don't really know if it is what it's called, of made in abyss is like mushoku tensei kinda
Bocchi the rock has to be the most overrated shows of all time....its was just terrible....the same thing repeating again and again....weak story..... too much over exaggeration
gay girls innit
Makima was best girl, till I read the manga and she showed her real face. Now Nayuta is best girl... Totally sane btw.
Made in Abyss season 1 was super awesome, but I found the story of season 2 very lackluster. I found the story very bland.
To all people who ever want to watch Made in Abyss, PLEASE don't make the mistake. This is the watch order: Season 1 > Movie > Season 2  Also, steel your heart, find a quiet place to watch and immerse yourself. You will definitely be shaken to your core.
i came back to this for the mia review at the end because some kpop idols are getting ripped to shreds for consuming it and i needed some help remembering that it actually has substance.
Garnt called me out.... it's 5 AM
No mention of Golden Kamuy? Pathetic.
I envy the person I was before watching made in abyss, and yet I don't ever wish to give up the experience of it. A true wonder of a story beyond human imagination. Aside from the pervy sh*t that stuf sucks /:
Soon as I heard the beginning of 5, I recognized the anime.
I can't believe that made in abyss is #1...I've been watching it, currently in the 2nd season. I've yet to understand how some of the over the top abuse and sexual depictions can be overlooked.
I tend to come back to this video every other month just to listen to how perfectly Gigguk talks about Made in Abyss. Masterpiece is more than fitting
I just wish Denji in chainsaw man got to hit makima I'm not gonna lie that art got me out here low key thirsty lmao hahahah
You gained a subscriber dude you hit the nail on the head on alot of these
Haven't watched the  Made in abyss anime yet, but I'm all caught up to the newest chapters in the Manga. I need to watch season 2 now for real, the moment I saw the visuals I know so well as still panels and heard the music I started bawling, my bunnies looked at me like they weren't sure whether they should call 911 for themselves or for me
Man called me out with the 3am shit
Edgerunners really came out of nowhere, at least for me.   The reason I like Edgerunners, so so so much, is because of one simple thing, It didn't feel like watching an anime.  You remember that feeling as a kid when having watched a ghibli movie for the first time, Not knowing there are more of that sort, that those cartoons origin from Japan, where they are called anime.   As someone who watched anime for several years now I come to appriciate shows that don't go with the typical anime. Shows that aren't predictable. moments that feel orginal. Moments that aren't solely here to prove that this is "anime". Moments that make you feel like you're actually watching a story because of the story aspect, without the need of throwing in typical anime tropes.   This is a show I know I can recommend people that don't like Anime, bacause I know that this show just tells a story, which people will appriciate, wether it actually is an anime or not dosen't even Matter bacause of how good it is.
F yeah. Bocchi the Rock was just fabulous. I freaking loved this Show, didn't expect myself to but I sure did. Also, the music, the characters, the animation. Just beautiful. Highly recommend anyone who has any interest in music to check this one out.
I honestly don't unserstand the hype about Love is war. To be completely honest the romance aspect was the thing I was least interested in.  I watched a lot of romance anime that did a way better job in terms of... well romance. I watched a lot of comedy anime that made me laugh more. I watched a lot more Slice of life anime that were just fun to watch or had a more meaningful message to tell.  So what's left? The only reason I actually Like this show is because of Chika and Ishigami.  But hey to each their own.
“Helps you appreciate the family you have around you” boorf
10:09 I literally get called out at 3:11am about watching YouTube videos at 3am 👀
as a shamless romance anime enjoyer I am disappointed with 2022 and 2023 for romance. dress up darling was the only great one. rental girlfriend is MID
I've read the manga content for Made in Abyss season 2 and I am very much afraid to watch it. But with this, I try because I know that it is gorgeous and spectacular to watch.
Attack on titan final season final edition special episode part 1
Gay girls innit
bro i know this is an old video but i need to say it WHERE THE FUK IS BLEACH? it was the best one of 2022
Is it just me or did your audio cut out during spy x family
Made in abyss is dem good, but scond season feels a bit like crap i dont know man
"Gay girls in it"
Jesus is our saviour ❤
I love call of the night the cool soothing vibe
Made in abyss is truly a masterpiece but also horrifying and some scenes just make me sick. And yet I can't look away. Not because of shock but because it's just... It makes me feel something. It was better said in the video. I truly hope that when the manga finishes and a new season (or movie) comes out it's gona be just as or even more amazing then the previous ones.   (Hopefully the creator doesn't get too carried away with gross stuff...)
Roamance genre is cringe
My fucking name is liam
Man, i watched a few episodes of Made in the Abyss when it first came out. I need to revisit, you nearly had me in tears with just the pure emotion of the clips. I'm off to stock up on tissues. Thank you for revitalising my joy in anime Gigguk. Keep up the amazing work.
Hate watching bleach is crazy to me, but you do you like how you going to tell someone bleach not worth the watch or read then be all hype for the new seasons it's giving bandwagon lol anything for views I see
Fun fact, this is the 2nd time Made in Abyss was chosen as the best anime of the year by Gigguk.
Gay girls innit ?
17:56 lmao mine was domestic girlfriend (I was just too horny (I mean my first EVER anime was kill la kill))
Easiest sub of my life
What's the name of the song used in the outro? I know it's from Link Click but I don't know the title
Your words on Made in Abyss are completely true. And still...😭
16:06 absolute eargasm from the song, I can feel my honor and glory strings being plucked😂
Hate the gay in so many anime, western influence in anime at its worst.
Meanwhile inazuma eleven: Cute but we got the world champ at age 12 and in one year even destroyed the whole glaxy in just 1 freakin year!!!!!
Haha 😂 just laughing at u guys should have born in asia 😂 dont even have cu😂
Imagine luffy finally getting gear 5 in 2025😂
Coming back to this after Armored Core 6 release, and it makes me realize what I love about my intergalactic mecha series: The business conflicts. Just the very idea that there wars being waged by giant arms manufacturing companies spanning solar systems is way to intriguing to me, and I actually want something that goes even deeper in the politics of it.       Of course, we still need the giant mecha fights.
That tifa/ceaser joke had me spitting out my water
Mob psycho hits different tho
I mean no disrespect but you have horrible taste in anime 29 minutes I won't get back feel like you were dressed in dragg while you were watching these shows
Gay girls innit
I had to watch the last episode of CSM three times because it felt like a five minute episode
"gay girls, innit?" You're not wrong bud.
4:40 what's next, golf games on motorcycles? 6:37 yes. 7:21 cgdct: cute girls doing counter-terrorism. 9:04 sports is just fandom for straight men. the wise understand this.
It gives you hope on a place of hopelessness !!
Haha Hunter Multiplied by Hunter
19:14 Kill me
Yea, Made in Abyss was truly something special. If they manage to live long enough, Reg is gonna have one hell of a harem
Oh my god I came here I search for I have nothing but now we're do I f****g start.
"I hope you had a great 2022!" imediatly after crushing my heart with the made in abyss reveiw.
Ah yes I love being called out unintentionally at 10:16  It’s 3am atm, he’s talking about Call of the Night, and my name is Liam. I know I should sleep Gigguk but it’s time for anime recommendations.
bruh, do you really think that America is like that?
Im sorry that Boeing 747 joke was brutal 🤣😭
summertime render summertime render i love summertime render i have no clue what to watch i need something like summertime render help help help
damn that made in abyss ost hits hard
How the F you know it's 3 AM??? I'm Goran hahahahaha
I'm kinda pissed that MiA S2 is so good, when i read the manga i utterly hated some of the characters we're supposed to like, to the point of cheering whem they died. That, combined with how hard the author makes it to seperate his art from him makes me really reluctant to watch the damn show, as good as it may be
Congrats on the marriage
2022 animé in a nutshell:  *GAY GIRLS INNIT*
Gay girls in it. lol 😂
Really surprised you didn't talk about Eighty-Six. Absolutely phenomenal anime, and it's a damn crime that it didn't win any awards.
How did you know it's 3 am😮😮
what is the name of number 4???
Mob Spycho 100 III OP had the best animation that I have ever seen
Yeh just a SOL and comedy anime, but it doesn't MATTER :))), well just top 30 bro.
20:15 yep, my first anime that I gave it 10/10, the best comedy and music anime I have ever watched, Bocchi the Rock and I glad it was in your top 4.
Summertime Rendering easily entered my top 3. Such a fantastic show, wish it wasn't so slept on.
I love when you told us what 14 even was
Please try Kemono Jihen.
then there is me watching this at morning 3am
this guy is so horny :D
'22 sure was a hell of a year for shows i just loved. And again you make me go try and finish abyss season 1
13:15 Why is this silent???
I swear, just hearing the piano from Made in Abyss makes me mist up immediately. What an amazing show I’d have never tried without Gigguk telling us what’s up
20:54 22:06 22:00 21:52
wheres aot
10:18 fuck me
Gay girls innit
Did he put Mob at #2 just so he could use that transition to #1
i think you reached the best you can get to video editing mastery
Wait how did you know its 3am when i am watching your videos
Where tf is bleach TYBW cour 1??
Lol I appreciate that they used real golf courses in Birdie Wing. Never watched it but I recognize the 18th at St. Andrews.
I am not even gonna lie but Demon Slayer's "Never give up" is the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life . I have literally watched this fight atleast 30 times in the past year. At this point I am just grateful and thank the author and especially the studio Ufotable for what they have done. Truly a masterpiece of a episode.
Wait, Mob is over?? There won't be any more seasons? NYOOOOOO
The Chainsaw Man opening always gives me goosebumps
3am rn😂
yeah it's gay girls innit, fite me
wow
Best best https://youtu.be/XBndoJcljyU
This video was awsome but at the same time i hate it because i dont know what to watch first :D
Lol that snacks is  for one day for me because it's looking delicious
The fact that I follow both you and your wife (because I find both of you to be some of the funniest people ever) made #14 even more funny.
Amazing video! Made in Abyss S2 was an incredible experience. Still breaks and warms my heart when i think about it.
made in abyss O_O yah.... i do really need a hug after that.... and therapy too tbh
Im still in post depression from cyber punk edgerunners such a good animes
> this is 3 am HOW DO YOU KNOW???
#1 gave me flashbacks
OMG you're have the best narration skills ever, thank you for this masterpiece~
I love how he announces the Pokemon as a huge thing then at his own WEDDING he's like "oh yeah and this happened" truly inspirational
Oh my fucking god Mark Goldbridge 😂😂😂😂 "he's bloody missed it" 😂
You did ask me what am I watching at 3AM, exactly as there is 3AM right now.
i got my biggest emotional damage in made in abyss just because of the bgm and i cant make my self to watch 2nd season
Mark my words my anime will be the best in 2023😈
The way u describe the anime is better than any anime
wasn't expecting to see goldbridge
IM SO SAD SOUVENIR GOT COPYRIGHT STRIKED, BEST OST OF THE YEAR
gay girls init
I've been looking for the name of the last Anime in this (Made in Abyss) for so damn long
Gotta love YouTube's bitch ass copyright system for ruining the section at 13:17
Ah yes, 10:46
Wait... is it "Gay girls in it" or "Gay girls innit"?
Dude where the f*ck is COTE
13 12 mane please
Oh god… I’m crying again… those poor kids.
24:05 🥲
7:58 FBI
6:49 I'm watching it now and tge fact that a lot of us watching an idol anime without getting tricked and knowing it's an idol anime is insane
THANK UUU 5:13/29:57
Can someone tell me what is the name of the second OST played in Made in Abyss section near the end?  not the Old Stories one.
How right you were about kaguya already. Started developing more interest into anime end of 2021 but kaguya was the one that introduced that whole world to me and appreciate anime on a whole 'nother level
Made in Abyss is going to be one of my favourite anime of all time, I can feel it. The innocence and wonder of the adventure these literal CHILDREN depart on, and the horrors they face as they would if their joirney took place in the real world. I love how it doesnt shy away from things like kids being frightened and peeing themselves, because thats exactly what a 12 year old in such a terrible situation might do. They dont give them plot armour just because they're kids, it makes it feel so impactful.
IVE BEEN CALLED OUT (my name is liam)
too much straight fan service in this anime list
I'm a simple man who laughs at the Jason Bourne joke.
this video was worth waiting for
What's the music playing from 23:06 to 23:30
The reason why animators give up on animating at times is to make the show funnier. Gay girls, innit?
good boy <3
Gintama content pls😢
Made in abyss s2 is just a filler arc
Anyone else who doesn't hear the audio from 13:17 to 13:30 ?
Didn't have to call me out on it being 3AM 🥲
Gundam the Witch from Mercury BEST TRACK 16:00
WE NEED MORE BOCCHI
Gundam sucks
Cought me off Guard  I am watching this on 3 am 😶
Really no eminence in shadows?
Another Gigguk banger! ❤
All the mob seasons were amazing. I was really sad when it ended.
Lycoris Recoil was pretty amazing to me. It had a slow pace but at the end it gets really good and interesting
Im so glad that Ya Boy Kongming is one of best anime 2022!
Usually with lists like this, I thank the uploader for letting me know that I missed nothing noteworthy in the last year, but you got me with #10... So thanks.
Made in Abyss is probably my favorite anime of all time. It's made me cry so many times.
I’ll make a ringtone out of 7:04. I’ll put it on repeat
It is actually 3am
6:13 once again looking at this lol and I forgot to comment, but no way he just put that famous Chinese meme clip also the long version, I never even seen the long version on Chinese media XD
Gay girls innit. :3
Demon slayer > Fate series
5 am actually...
Bleach is number 1 for me
oof, big miss not using the 1 from Mob Psycho for the transition into #1
"if there is a single introvert bone in your body, something in here will drag out a core memory you've buried deep in the recesses of your mind" 21:41  me, having a full introvert skeleton, 3 minutes and 39 seconds into the first episode "this thing's gonna speak to me, ain't it? and almost all in callouts"
I am not brave enough for 'Made in Abyss'
Lycoris recoil was so good y’all have to watch it
I actually forgot to breathe while watching demon slayer season 2
horimiya > kaguya sama
where tf is tybw bruh?!?!?!?
Weird u totally missed out on ranking of kings and frien about the elf mage
Gigguk: It's 3:00 AM what are u doing watching YouTube videos Me:3:49 AM 😅
fucking legend
Bocchi The Rock y Kaguya Sama rompieron 2022
יאללה יאללה
I'd highly recommend Tomodachi Game as well one of the best in 2022
My name is Liam How the fuck did this even work
I was a himena fan :c
Of course pedobait takes first place.
my my my i gotta penis lmfao *subscribed*
“Disturbing” is the best way to describe Made in Abyss. Not scary, just deeply disturbing in every way you can imagine.
Gigguk should do a video about Pokemon
Watched made in abyss 2 and edgerunners back to back. I'm now completely dead inside
Not giving the actual title and puttting numbers (because you hoped people would watch longer) was a bad move my dude. You earned that dislike hope you are proud.. If you were a true weeb (or compassionnate) you'd put a title because many people have already warched what you're showcasing
"it's you, it's 3am" .. it's 3:36am h o w
Bro my Mom asked me about ash getting champion lol
(6:09) he roasted him so hard he summoned sound effects
10:07 genuinely scared me since im watching this at 3:04 am
i miss anime so much
I know made in abyss is a great anime with in-depth world building, unique character design, amazing music, and sht like that. But still, if you into this anime then what the actual fuck is wrong with you.
6:06我的天，诸葛亮的梗都有。。。这是要我果断订阅啊🤣
There's no way you actually recommend watching this golf trash...
fck made in teh abyss, its the 4 video  i see it on the 1 place, i saw some thing i just dont have the guts to watch that lvel of carnage, even tho i love horror movies and series, books, short movies and so, dont know if it is for the cute style but i just cant get to see that nightmare of an anime
Didn't see a single anime last year. Will watch a few now.
OMFG YEEEESSS!!! YEEESSS!!! I AM SO FUCKING GLAD YOU MENTIONS CYBERPUNK EDGERUNNERS! I FUCKING CRIED SO HARD ITS ONE OF MY FAVORIITTTEEESSS
call of the night is w
Marin is indeed the best. Love her. I still gotta catch up with the show and Spy X Family though
i am a jojos´ bizzare adventure fan
The 2 mecha animes I've watched were gurren laggan and darling in the fraxx.
Bleach hater alert
No audio from 13:16 - 13:32
Why does no one lost all the anime covered here??? I just want the titles and im not a weeb so idk how to find them :(
bro that speech of Made in Abyss got me pregnant and im a dude, dude
🤓"urm akchually it's only 2:11 am"
Jojo part 6?
Too bad I couldn't watch this year's best sports anime without supporting slavery. So I kinda missed all of it. Ah well.
Jojo part 6 ?
Why the start of the spy x family part got no sound？
way too many visual meme, if u have 30sec  to a min to present something focus on it and don't dilute the content with visual memes, just my 2 cents
The nights arnt safe in the UK either we have drunk weirdos out at night 😅
The most replayed is wild
I lost it at the “jesus christ thats jason bourne”
Made in Abyss season 2 was the most heartbreaking, horrific, haunting, terrifying, soul crushing story about friendship family and love in a world that makes absolutley no reasonable sense; you just have to go with it and not question why things happen but instead just sit back and watch the most hauntingingly beautiful show you've ever seen unfold. 10/10.
BRO WHERE IS STONE OCEAN
Gigguk your content is amazing, there couldn't possibly be any way to make it any bette-"gay girls innit"
Uhm. The description lists one song under "Music used"... what's the song from Cyberpunk called?
made in abyss was actually different bro easily in my top 10
I loved every second of summertime rending
OMG SUMMERTIME RENDERING IS SOOO SOO GOOD. I VERY MUCH RECOMMEND IT. LITERALLY THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER WATCHED. THE SUSPENSE KEPT ME ON EDGE EVERY SINGLE TIME. LITERALLY MY TOP 1, IT WAS SO IMPACTFUL WHEN I GOT TO THE ENDING!!!!
I can feel chills in the back of my neck after that Made in Abyss segment. This was amazing.
your script writing and performance skills are maad bro keep it up
Another wrong anime tier list boyzzz
Great choice of 1911 for the "unless you in America" joke!
its 4:45am and the call of the night section was like Gigguk was literally talking to me
Loved it . Thank you
Mark gold ridge 😂😂😂👌🏾
I don't know how you make these videos. every second you hit us with unexpected. man that was impressive.
All mid garbage once again except ofc mob and made in abyss. Literally it. That’s why I quit watching anime besides everyone dick riding what’s “the best written” washed up shit. I wish anime was good again☹️
Oh man, thanks so much.
Alright! Love the fact that Made in Abyss was your favourite of 2022, because it's my favourite anime of all time, but what in the actual fuck is up with Kaguya-sama's placement?! 6th?! Chainsaw Man, Bocchi, Cyberpunk and Mob Psycho higher (I do love them btw, but they don't touch Kaguya-sama)?! I know it's opinions and all that jazz + you said that any of the top 6 could've taken the number 1 position, but you can't tell me Season 3 of Kaguya-sama wasn't an absolute masterpiece deserving of at least a top 3 ranking! Even after finishing the manga, the Dual Confession Cultural Festival arc is still among my favourites, standing at 3rd or 4th place (Still not sure if I prefer Dual Confession or New Game more)!
god i love you for that maki run
When ITA soundtrack starts: 😭
i agree with most of the assessment, with the exception of Gundam.Even though it felt like a major release, the show feel more like Gundam Reconguista in G. The gundam design, the eyes are larger, the proportion, the armory, the color scheme, all of it. If you want to talk about corporation, Gundam IBO also does that, so this idea is not unique. For AAA gundam series, normally the storyline and MC has a sense of danger in it, either dangerous surrounding like war, or battle of survival, or the character is dangerous, like Wing and IBO. But here i dont feel it here, the setting is in a classroom, like a typical japanese anime story, the battle is in mock battlefield. Even though there is a risk, but it is not like real death, the only thing u lose is your face and reputation, so there are no real stake in it.  So all i can say is Gundam Mercury is a disappointment when compare to other AAA gundam series. It on its own is fine, but when u attach the name gundam, and u set your story in classroom, that just blew it away.  AAA Gundam example : gundam IBO, seed series, wing, 00, unicorn series (or UC series). Even Mobile Fighter G Gundam is better than this.
First time i have ever watched on of your videos, all i want to say is....  THANK YOU for introducing me to not only an amazing list of anime to watch, but what is now my all time favourite anime opening Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!! <3
Gigguk is truly the GOAT when he speaks passionately about anime. As I grow older, as an adult with responsibilities, I am unable to watch every anime, but these recaps make sure that I am not missing out on the newer masterpieces. Love your work dude🔥🤩
aint no way the yofukashi no uta manga ended
10:06 never felt more called out in my life
I fuckin hated bocchi the rock. I couldn't watch the second episode she was too annoying.
What gets liking to watch golf gay girls. Innit
Until no1: ueah, I can relate, this was nice, this was fun, maybe I should rewatch that... no1 first seconds NO GOD NO PLEASE STOP
Why is no one talking about Mob Psycho? It’s a masterpiece. It ended when it should have. Wholesome characters, amazing animation, awesome soundtrack.
Personally, I'd swap Summertime Rendering and KNY cuz it's just that much more bingeable.
you missed the opportunity to say enGOLF!
Attack on Titan is my favorite gundam
I will say and this is only because I was one of the people that was blessed I guess even though I didn't really know a lot of people had trouble with that game it was more something all this all people talk about online and that was cyberpunk because the game ran smoothly for me but like literal but I want to literally save probably like 3 to 4 months before that show release the game was already good as all the bugs were fix and people who we're like me who said the game has been good for minute got clowned and then people played the game after watching the series and then they started saying it but at the same time I was in the worst punch in other people's eyes cuz I always said it was a good game it was just not properly handled
L Bad list get copyrighted bleach is the number-one get out of here😂😂😂😂
Licorice recoil is kind of like top 5 for me out of this new season I'm not going to hold you I'm going to be very honest too I think season 2 of spy family was pretty mid I think it started off really well and then I liked the tennis stuff and then that was really good I think those were the only peaks of that season because I'm not sure if I'm the only one but I want to see more of yor doing her instead of fucking Lloyd
Honestly I have somewhat hatred over this anime it's mostly for the Dove and that's simply that I cannot enjoy the rapping section and like I could get past Now understand the rapping if it wasn't battle rap where you need to know what it said it can't just sound good ended I I dropped your boy
thanks! Now I know what to watch
Made in Abyss deserve that number 1 spot
Attack On Titan is getting out of hand with "The Final Season".
I'm watching this at 9:37 AM on a weekday because I took a week off of my day job thank you very much. I USED to be a night owl lmao
You know made in abyss is powerful when just garnt speaking about it with the soundtrack in the background made me tear up
Thanks for pointing me towards some awesome anime I might not have watched otherwise. Bloody fantastic anime reviews and editing!
"one thing i have learned about the anime community is that the more popular an anime is the more cooler you get by calling the show mid" ,,, that has to be the truth of the century 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else experience a no audio glitch when the section about spy x family begins?
Please tell me anyone seen the anime 86? I know it wasnt 2022 i believe it was 2021 but it was so good
Summertime render is absolutely spectacular. Please check it out if you haven't already
call of the night was peak
When the romance anime that drew you in was Domestic Girlfriend...
Finally got myself to watch summer time render and...holy shit. I would not be able to watch this shit weekly.
Crazy man. I was for sure thinking cyberpunk, made in abyss, New aot, chainsaw man, etc.. ez anime of the year. Then this pink haired psycho comes in and wrecks my shit. Bocci for me will be #1. Guitar player things
So no One Piece?..
Bro, so happy to see you give Made in Abyss Season 2 the visibility it needed.  The characters, the world building, and the writing are just so exceptional and unique.  Well done. Thanks for this list.
your amazing gigguk!
Thank you gigguk for recommending made in abyss. i cried at least 10 times. best anime i watched so far, so original
no shikimori?
Bocchi at 4 puts a smile on my face.
Won't lie, had a bit of a panic attack after my name was directly called out around 10:02 -- looking over at the clock and realizing how late it was only made it worse.
This Gundam show and you seem to have forgotten what Gundam is about tbh. Child soldiers and its horrors.
Power is just a female discord mod because she doesn’t shower and she smells and loves it.
Garnt! Have the Lead Guitarist in you reawaken after watching Bocchi The Rock? 🤣
what the hell? how does garnt knows that i dont watch mecha but thinks that code geass is the most goated anime
Bro you made me wanna watch made in abyss again 😢
Thing woth Kaguya is that simple explanation is still a good explanation and the repeat of lacking romance plot hurts me with it being considered a great romance
What is show in slot 14 called?
Pro"  To Your eternity season2  Deserved position in this 😥
Sad thing season 3 of made in abyss is gonna take long bcuz no manga material
I didn't want to be that guy, but come on. New Gundam is very underwhelming in terms of mecha combat, the plot is interesting as far this franchise goes, but calling this as Sunrise gave it best effort they could is huge overstatement - assault on Torrington base from Unicorn alone blows this whole show out of the water and it's been more than a decade since Unicorn first launched, even IBO had much more effort put in it combat wise and it's 25 episodes per season. Fights are flashy, yes, but they lack everything else, like good camera angles and direction in general.
Your bit on Mob Psycho brought tears to my eyes. I felt the same way about that masterpiece of a show!
Thank you for the recommendation just finished Code Geass. Was great but wish it had more seasons.
where can I watch Made in Abyss in the USA?
no.1 soundtrack:try not to get goosbumps
It's insane how people are hooked on MIA, like you rarely see that for any other manga/anime (except those that get new chapters every week or so, but that's to be expected). It seems like people can't get MIA out of their mind lol. And to be faire I don't quite understand because i think made in abyss is mid.
I was hoping "uncle from another world" would be in this list (
Christ i always cry with that MIB soundtrack even though it's been a long time since i heard and see a clip 😢
Rare Gigguk W
Hi Gigguk! Thanks for the summertime render tip!
Dude what the hell, I came here to find an anime to watch and now I just wanna watch more of your videos, you are way too entertaining!
Got the damn shivers and almost tears when both the Cyberpunk songs came on, and the Made in Abyss one did. After watching both series, those are some serious emotional triggers now, and that's how you can tell they're incredible works. Great job on the list, Gigguk, these are all bangers and the memes are still top-notch!
I mean... we're just gonna ignore Stone Ocean & Thousand Year Blood War??  Butchered hype aside, Part 6 has the strongest writing Jojo's Bizarre Adventures has had in the entire Joestar Saga.  And, Bleach has been nothing but pure hype, and most Big 3 fans agree that this final arc is peak Bleach.  Also, is Vinland Saga Season 2 a 2023 anime because that's peak fiction, too.
God bless made in abyss back on the top of the list. It got shafted so hard on anime awards, Misaki Kuno is the VA OF 2022
If there are some parts where the video is muted it is unfortunately because I got hit by copyright
The witch from Mercury is such a cool anime to watch, I just haven’t been able to get past episode 2 because the teenage drama makes me cringe 😢 Such a shame that the context is so cool but the actual plot line so outdated :/
Is the audio and video de-synced for anyone else?
we need edge runner 2
My fav line 4:33 gay girls in it lmfao
The way you describe made in abyss is just wholesome
nice
I don't know why but nobody making these best of lists does mention where can we watch the mentioned anime (unless they have a problem with the service like Disney+ in this one). I'd love for the reviewers to mention this so I can actually know where to go for these.
My name is Liam and I was just called out. Except it's only midnight so we're good.
Sunrise will set the trends in anime industry once again just like in the past.
I agree "ya boy Kong Ming" is infectious! That opening.... I cant stop singing - "ya tiki tiki bun bun"
Didn’t see Jojos bizzare adventure in it but i forgave you for putting a bunch of references. 😤
To your eternity was really good.
Man, I cried just at Gigguk's description and the background OST of Made in Abyss, I dont know if Iam ready for that shit  Edit: I wasn't
7:19 just fucking killed me. It hurt not to laugh
WHo knows the name of the song that gigguk played during the battle of gundam: witch of mercury
Made n ayss and mo psycho s3 ae definitely my top 2 too from last year
I'm so happy made in abyss is finally getting the recognition it deserves TT
Made in abyss 🥺
I don't even really watch anime. I just love Gigguk's dank ass meme edits.
Call of the Night has nice vibes. Watch the OP/ED, a few episodes and forget about the rest. It's very overhyped.
17:32  talking about shows that introduced your into genres, i never really liked mecha anime.                  *because darling in the franxx was my first one*
I promise you gundam witch from mercury was a story copped from armored core 6 that has been in development for the past 6 years. Literally the same premise of every armored core game that has ever existed. You are a Raven operating your own customized mech and are tasked and hired by different corporations to complete specific tasks to gain control of a system or planet through these actions and conflicts. Just saying armored cores been around since 1997
I had just finished Made in Abyss s2 and now I understand why you said it is indescribable
will there be a season 2 of edgerunners??
Lycoris Reocil is worth watching, but it is NOT a good anime. The first two eps were great and hardcore, then things started to get weird. One huge problem is that creator does not know what they want to make. Cute girls or dark dystopia story? It's jumping back and forth. At the end, it just ends in an absurd and hurry way. I have to say that it is so disappointing. Another issue is guns. People compare Chisato to JW because she uses C.A.R.S. However, she uses it in almost every scene. C.A.R.S is used in close range combat (I mean really really close) with a cost of worse stability and accuracy. When I see her running and shooting enemy 20 meters away with CARS, I was like WTF. And there are a bunch of other problems. I heard that they are actually making the second season for LycoReco, I hope they learned from their mistakes. Because I really like this anime and dont want it to become trash again.
if my man dont like kobeni then idk what to say
7:25 That anime is racist. Just cut him out of the picture
10:12 jumpscare
Bocchi The Rock is just Pink Guy but a highschool girl.
Listen, and I know this may be a hot take, but if your plot structure, themes, conflict, characters, and plotlines are mid. No matter how good the animation is your anime sucks. I know the visuals and sound design are a big part of the appeal of anime. But if demon slayer didn't have beautiful animation it would have never made the list of best animes of 2022. If you say "it may not have the best plotlines or the most complex characters" before presenting something then I am ignoring this anime. Cyberpunk edge runners has complex characters and REALLY good animation, so props there, but our criterion shouldn't be as simple as just, 'animation make eyes feel good'. I'm just saying we need to up our standards to writing/animation.  P.S. Not saying Gigs does this, but he kind of does with demon slayer.
I feel like the quality of my life would drastically improve with gay girls in it.
HAVE YOU NOT WATCHED HELLO WORLD !
I was thinking what can be first on the list when after one second of the song i was like "Hell Yeah!" :D
I just have to comment because of the last part or just the entire video in general. How you described Made In Abyss or other Anime like Summer Time Rendering, and even other previous Anime from similar videos like Mushoku Tensei genuinely got me invested, intrigued and mesmerized. There has always been an effect on me whenever someone describes a piece of media they love and expressing the power of that show, that music, etc. It's something I praise when I see people like you do it because it manages to capture an audience and let them know, even for a second, your love, your feelings on this show. It hypes me up, it makes me excited, it scares me, it makes me cry, and it makes me shut up and truly take something like a simple raw explanation of a show with the utmost seriousness. These explanations of these Anime, even if I've never seen them make me feel so much happiness, that's the beauty of Anime videos, video essays for me. It can be fun and exciting but truly beautiful with the most genuine and sincere expression translated to words to convey the feeling the piece of media you watched gave you, with the right editing, etc. It's what makes me want to express myself out there as I have a pretty uneventful, nothing life I don't like and want to escape through Anime. It's one of the things right now that makes me so god damn happy and sad, and just so many other different emotions. Please make more stuff like this it's genuinely amazing and I love it.
S6 of My Hero was insane, and I'm not a big fan of the series, to me it was always too fluffy  Also just finished watching Made in Abyss... and I dont think any other anime is better than this, this is the best anime, what do i do with my life now...
AoT has as many final seasons as terraria has final updates
Finishing Cyberpunk Edge Runners and Made in Abyss season 2 on the same day hits fucking differently. 😭
This tells me I need to finish Summertime Rendering and watch Gundam: WFM and avoid Made in Abyss for a long time. Edgerunners scarred me and I can't handle another scarring.
Ahegao face tier liST
19:45 Does anyone know the song here? I’ve been looking for weeks after it now. I can’t find the song  EDIT: Found it, it's Sins of The Father from Metal Gear Solid 5
This still beats Crunchyroll's Anime of The Year 2022
18:01 i got into romance anime from A silent voice and My first girlfriend is a gal 💀💀💀
(Spoilers for Chainsaw man and The Witch from Mercury if you haven't gotten round to them yet) You know, its weird. Hinemo's death in chainsaw man was OBJECTIVELY straight up a FAR more impactful scene, yet, it was Elan"s/enhanced person #5's death in The Witch from Mercury that made my heart feel like it was slammed by an isekai truck full of punching bags....Maybe its because CSM is FULL of death whereas WfM has few and far between, making it more impactful when it does happen. Maybe its because Himeno kinda-sorta chose her death for herself (if you ignore the bullet wound) and she fought til the bitter end to protect her friends, whereas Elan's was forced upon him by a heartless cooperation that didnt even see him as human so he just gave up and accepted it. Or maybe its cause the happy birthday song always creeped me the fuck out who knows 😂
Who is going to tell Garnt that not every blonde anime character isn't his wife. Next he going to say every blonde women is totally his wife. Defintely doesn't have a fetish.
The best description I can give of Made in Abyss, especially season 2, is that it's a show that forces you to confront the natural suffering of life, and come to terms with it. That's the most accurate description of the emotions it invokes that I can come up with.
ngl lie it was a great video but kinda sad theres no montage at the end
eminence in shadow IS the anime of the year. the memes we will get from this one season will live on for at least a hundred years.
was the name of number 10
The person that said it was SPy multiplied by Family must call Hunter x Hunter "Hunter squared"
Bocchi : "she is just like me for real" with cute anime girl  Strappare lungo i bordi : "he is just like me for real" with Roman accent
Man thanks for this incredible review. I decided to watch Made in the Abyss after your review, somehow I think that you can't  say you are an anime fan if you missed the best anime of the year.
come back after a month to rewatch the made in abyss section because the way you bring in the OST at the beginning hits so hard. Was sure it would be the most watched part of the video, that or 27:28, surprised to see it wasn't but considering what is the most watched part of this video I can hardly say I'm disappointed or surprised
It's an anime review, innit?
gay girls innit
Best anime of all time  1)Aot  2)Demonslayer  3)Tokyo ghoul
Never judge a anime by it's poster, I thought summer time rander is just some slice of life + romance anime, I didn't even care to check gener. But thanks to gigguku
gigguk video never dissapoints, the combination of meme and analysis of everything is too good
Chainsaw Man review is ON POINT!!! 🤣😂💀
Get girls in it, btw cyberpunk left me kinda broken, i just feel kinda empty after finishing it up, my faith in world is gone, now i am gonna watch kaguya sama again to regain it back
25:40 Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees, 1st place - "Made in abyss". Congratulations!!!
Disgusting Manga reader here. Cherish the time before Chainsaw Man season 2 because ignorance is bliss...
Yeah it gave me chills.🥶
Cyberpunk was just a spectacle without substance.
wtf i didnt know demon slayer had a second season this year. im not that bothered about demon slayer im just surprised i didnt hear about it.
gay girls innit
Fall of the night had one banger of an intro/outro also def vibes 10/10
Trigger gave David the Kamina haircut I knew he was going to die
My favorite 2022 animes  1. Chainsaw man 2. Bocchi the rock 3. Can’t decide
How do ypu know it's 3 a.m.?
I believe that Attack on Zeno will just continue going halfway to the end, then halfway again, then halfway again, getting closer and closer to the end but never actually getting there.
How dafuq Just watching a recap of 2022 anime make me feel empty?
Idc what u tell me, the best football anime to ever come out was days, shit was my childhood and u cant ruin it
Glad to see Grant got married his waifu)))
This list is perfect to me. Love MiA definitely one of the best tv experience ever. Thank you Gigguk for the all the recommendations through out the years. Your videos never ceased to entertain me. Your energy and passion got me into anime and kept me watching all these years. Kuddo man!
OH MY GOD IS THAT THE EmOtIoNaL dAmAgE?!??! STEVEN THAT DA HEIILL
Young me: start off watching cute and romance anime Current me:after watching aot skipping all cute and romance anime recommendations SKIP
I always knew that Gigguk is the best anime girl of 2022
While I am sad that AOT is not in the list cuz it's currently my favourite anime of all time, I'm glad I landed on this video. Cuz it gave me a long list of anime to go through
Where can I watch anime for free dawg 🥶
I died, "boeing 747 carrying belgium and germany"
9:53 which character / anime is said "interesting characters"?
When he mentioned K-On! All I thought was "Mother F*ing Tea!"  That said this was a great compilation with amazing editing that tied each section together beautifully.  GREAT job Gigguk!
Ima sum up this video: gay girls, brutally, emotional damage, and crippling social anxiety.
That perfect panty shot block though, 10/10 I'm watching.
Where can I watch bleach? Why tf is it not on crunuchyroll?
Its too bad it wasnt the real Ash but some kid with a difurent art style
🙃
finally summertime is getting a little recognisation lately.
I'm really enjoying the "multiple mini episodes" format that romance animes have been going for in the last few years.
Actually its not 3 am, its only 230. Thank you very much. But i will be watching the fall anime in a nutshell after this so
I exactly followed the steps of waking up a coma patient as shown in this video. But I only got fired anf arrested.
This is my list top 5 animes of 2022 1. Kaguya sama (No questions asked this was the best i cried my eyes out on the last story of the manga) 2. Bocchi the rock (I don't know how many times I have to go the bathroom crying and holding my stomach while watching this anime) 3. Spy  family (Bc anya and beckey are cute)
10:18 I just got called out so hard names not liam but funny innit
....Where The Fudge is Ranking of Kings?!?! (sees it came out 2021, me not seeing videos cause im dumbnut baka). Sorry.
To Garnt, Grant, Gram, Grand, Great,   PS: I want to keep going but i don't know any other word that can keep rhyming with his name or mispronounced his name... You can keep going tho
…we're never getting a mention of Romatic Killer, are we
DUDE! THAT FRIGHTENED ME SO FUCKING MUCH! i'm liam and he is like yes you, i was like DA FUCK!(i was doing other stuff while this was playing in the background so had no context of the joke)
9:54 what the fuck it's literally 3 a.m. here. I felt so attacked I gonna go sleep in my bed.
I can't believe MIA is popular now back when i started it reading never thought it would come this far legit my fav anime
DID YOU FR JUST SAY NON-YOU-SIDD-E-AN? Its non you-clidd-e-an innit
Made in abyss season 2 really needs get more attention. It was overshadowed by so many of all the other big hitters coming out, but was one of my favorite sequals that came out. Music: impeccable Story: Heartbreaking World: Cruel Feels: 1000%
You only need to here Old Stories playing to sink you back in that state. I paused the show about 5 times to go on spotify and just look for the track.
IT'S ACTUALLY 3 FECKIN' AM RN! WHAT THE HECK!
Gigguk should just go be an advertiser. His explanation of every anime makes me want to watch it but I have a lot of anime on my plan to watch on MAL.
God damn it my name is Liam and I felt personally attacked
is made in abyss not on crunchyroll or any other streaming service?
Mid in abyss
very pog
As for how you say spy x family, the katakana in the jp title just says spy family so that's how I pronounce it
This video made me laugh, feel nostalgic and I got goosebumps too. Thank You for making me appreciate anime once more. 2022 was a banger  and I am looking forward to 2023. Great video Gigguk.
Garnt really calling me out at 10:08 it's 3:55am  And then he goes and shows us #1 which made me cry even though i didn't watch its current season yet?
Bro you just HAD to bring up made in abyss, my heart can’t TAKE it
im watching this while doctors drill into my knee to fix this, your the reason that i have the will to keep living gigguk
2022 was an insane year, one of the greatest years in a while.
10:45
Him: come on it's three Am Me: Noo… thats not true it's one Am
lol Jeff
Omg my cousin's name is Liam and he is a degenerate how in the fuck even did
2022 Truly An Amazing Year For Us. Thx 2022 And Welcome 2023
Damn it was exactly 3:00 AM when he called me a degen
Summer time rendering was so epic man Edit: kaguya as well prob my fav
Mad respect for your number 1 spot.
10:15 Bloody hell how did he knew I sleep late
the 7th one made me say "noooooooooooooooooooooooo"
“Gay girls, innit” yeah that about sums it up
Gay girls innit.
Another amazing video man.
First time watcher and instant subscriber. As much as I wanna watch all of these, first order of business is watching more of your videos my guy. Very awesome job
Made in Abyss is truly a masterpiece and the fact that even after all it's horrors it still comes out without you feeling any hate towards any of its characters in season 2 is truly remarkable. I still feel for vieko and faputa. And vieko is one of my fav character in all anime.
My brother and sister don't watch animes but still watched Spy x Family with me and it was the best thing
gay girls innit
Bocchi supremacy
cyberpunk broke me 5 days straight still getting goosebumps hearing that outro song
I'm watching this video 3 weeks late having just finished watching Eminence in Shadow and hoping it would be on here, but then I was overjoyed to THAT Made in Abyss theme. Thank you Gigguk.
a beautiful synopsis of made in abyss. no anime i have ever watched has come close to the experience that MiA can provide
Bro no offense but you overate the wrong things especially the whole “girl” genre of things like most of the anime’s rated up high are because of the girls 😑
I like how he tosses the term weeb around like bro not everyone who watches anime are cringe lords
Man i fucking love your channel what a video
okay, i just looked at the clock and its 3 am, f me i guess...
what is a wife?
Put Chainsaw Man above Spy Family you nullify any authority or the illusion of taste or sound mind you might have ever had. To put it on the list at all.
she was truly.... made in abbyss.....
I absolutely agree with number one 100%
4:20 I was in shock, I was like   *What is this man trying to show us?*
Gundam witch from Mercury was phenomenal and epic new entry in the Gundam universe
Birdie Girls golf game and ya Boy Kongming! I loved those series!
Bruh the whole year flashed before my eyes through this video 🥲
Made in Abyss is by far my favorite anime of all time. It’s so powerful and the journey you take is beyond anything you’d ever expect with this art style. I still haven’t finished Season 2, though, cause I don’t wanna be without episodes to watch if I ever need to watch something like it, but dammit, I’m already here, waiting for Season 3
What's this specific music? 19:44 I've heard it so many times but I don't know where it's from. Can anyone please tell me?
I didnt expect goldbridge here
i dont think i am brave enough to watch the number 1. ? do you mean everything you say in this video or just reading out your script?
22:37
yo, was the new video Copyright claimed or something?
where is the new video, why remove it?
Gigguk why did you delete the winter 2023 video?
Made in abyss is the one anime that I'm too scared to try
Ayoooo why you removing the latest vid
Anyone got any updates on the winter 2023 video? Has the editor woken up yet or do we have a re-release time XD
10:10. It's literally 3am rn and my name is Liam. What is this wizardry?
Gg gigguk you removed the video huh, shame on youuuu lol
Why did he take down the other video?
Garnt why did you just remove the new video 😂😂 hope you put it back again
Edgerunners >>>>>>>
he removed the video for winter 2023 because the audio was desynced, be patient
GARNT WHY IS YOUR WINTER 2023 DELETED?
where da flip did the winter video go
The new video just got removed !
Bruh was hyped for the New video just for it to be removed
Only the real ones know he removed the winter 2022 video after 2 hours
recent vid gon
Dang only 2hrs and they remove his newest video
10:22 literally 3:45 am right now
The world cup was legit the most fun I’ve had watching anything on TV in like the past 3 years. Glad you brought it up, because it really was more anime than anime itself. We got Japan as the hardcore underdog that turns it around at the last second against amazing teams like something out of old school inazuma 11. We got the favorites like Portugal losing to relatively new but history-making teams like Morocco, and we got the Rocky Balboa of football, Messi himself, at likely his final world cup, finally bringing home the only award he didn’t have and the one he always cared about the most. Also that final match was legit the best world cup match ever played: unexpected beginning, mid-game frustration, the lategame comeback, 2 great extra time halves with some of the best moments in the entire competition (eg: Emi Martinez’s last minute save with his leg), Mbappe getting to show his worth as one of the future greats by scoring a hat trick in the world cup final and keeping france in the game, and then the tense penalties where Emi Martinez again shows his worth and manages to win it for Argentina after the Argentinian players scored. Also the redemption for Montiel who was the reason France got a penalty by having him be the one to win Argentina the cup in penalties. Plus the celebration afterwards outdid any celebration ever portrayed in anime. All around a great fucking time to be an Argentina and Messi fan.
"Gay Girls, innit?" Hahahahahahahahaha Yea
can someone tell me which show is at 10:44 ??
chainsaw men did meet the hype
Has Garnt never seen Jormungand?
wtf, why you banned last video in Russhia?
Gooooood
The studio behind "Ya Boy Kongming" tricked gigguk into watching an idol anime by pretending it was an isekai
Boochi the rock is good
I call it just Spy Family. I think the X is silent.
Make a video talking about The Eminence in Shadow with the title "So...here we have Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!"
😐 how did you know my name
makima is mid
I never saw the x in Spy Family
I wonder when gigguk will make a video about The Eminence in the shadows 🤔
Putting Made in Abyss in any spot other than 1, will ruin the entire video flow. Made in Abyss has to be at the end.
What is the anime on #14?
Imma need the sauce for that konming rap battle
Gigguk have you watched the eminence in shadow?
I'm curious if gigguk will talk about eminence of shadow since it's his type of isekai
28:38 - Sosu?
gay girls innit
All good thing finally come to end and with that's it Gigguk I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FUELING OUR LIVES WITH COLOR ANIME AGAIN ✌️SENPAI ARITGATO
Got passed the halfway point and I was like "guess no Made in Abyss s2 then..." nice to see it talked about, even in vague terms
Maybe you can do "The Fruit of Evolution" in minutes
HEY I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S 8PM, DONT TRY AND CALL ME OUT NOW
Made in Abyss programed a pavlovian response in me. If I hear "Old Stories" by Kevin Penkin, then it is time to cry. Truly science in action.
what's the song at 19:45?
Made in Abyss was a roller coaster of emotion, when it's sad it really is fucking sad, when it's depressing it really is gut wrenching state of depression, when its happy and beautiful it really is delightful.
Seeing Made in Abyss, a show that I started with the Manga, going to watch season 1, and after giving up on a season 2, actually getting it, and having all the emotions and immersion of it even after reading the manga beforehand, I still felt like it was the first time seeing it. Truly a masterpiece that deserves the first place. Well done Gigguk
I Have a friend who wants to be just like you pls refer him : Treasure Adetunji @phantom psychopath  ,that's his channel ,pls refer him in your next video , thanks
Man your videos always make me cry. Even though i have been watching anime for the past 10 years the videos remind me how beautiful they really are. Your writing is everything i feel about anime and want to tell them to someone but none of my friends really understand how beautiful anime really are.
Man, I don't know why I haven't watched the new Made in Abyss yet. Why I haven't yet read the Manga sitting in my shelf. When Season 1 was new, I showed it to so many people. Thanks for reminding me, Garnt.
Danny Aarons😂
Where is the Anya on a rollercoaster scene from?? I’ve watched all the episodes but can’t find it
10:08 why did you talk to me directly it’s 2am mate
That fucking soup!!!!
hes made a masterpiece
Ayo what's that song in the last bit shits been haunting. Must find it
The eminence in shadow
The return of Bleach and Roofpiece (Zoro vs Kaido, Luffy vs Kaido) definitely were the top moments in anime this year.
Lycoris recoil being so low is criminal
Bocchi the Rock gave back the fucking hype that people felt when K-On first aired. and made it better, like after years and years of moe anime girls with almost same design of k-on, comes Bocchi who perfected it
Can we get a video dedicated to made in abyss, s2 was unbelievably gripping and intense and id love to see a video about it
Watched at 3am can confirm
Excuse me it's only 2 AM.  Also, Akiba Maid War didn't make the cut huh.
what anime is the busty vampire from at 5:00? For plot reasons...
Made in abyss as number one absolutely based
imagine watching 10:10 moment and my time is at that moment 3:00
i really fell off anime this year... I maybe watched 5 of these... well time to binge watch everything
10:10 its 3 am nights, i mean wtf its actualy 2:25 am thats fucking creapy :D and i love the Video now my watch list again full :D
bleack 2022 and attack on titan s4 part 2 or there is a low for anime with parts?
6:48 - kpop bois, we got him
I binged made in abyss season 2 I freaking loved it and I have no idea wtf I watched
Brilliant work, mate. Genius writing
I watch demon slayer on my old laptop and it crashed and shut down on me
Its weird playing through Cyberpunk when it first came out and hearing that song plenty of times. Thinking its a nice bop but mostly associating it with the terrible driving physics of the game. Then you watch Edgerunners and you are like "Oh its cool they are using songs from the game." and by the end they make a song you already have heard dozens of times turn into emotional damage.
Great video, Why isn’t aot s4 pt2 on here. It was one of the most hyped drops of 2022 that wasn’t chainsaw man?
I want him to talk about the eminence in shadows it's so good
22:32 bocchi rocks.
Oh man, gigguk keeps on delivering this gems, at this point I'm wondering how the hell he does it¡?.
hi. sorry for asking this in an unrelated video but have you raid "The beginning after the end" if you have. what are your thoughts?
15 just seems like another gunslinger girl.
"made in abyss" is more like an anime which you can't express your emotion enough!!!!! much much loved this anime & appreciation to the creators😍
Read dandadan or I will tell your wife to beat you
I've never met a Liam...
not gonna lie, Spy X Family was a huge disappointment for me. Humor didnt hit and coulndt care less about either the "spy" plot or the family relationships.
So where’s bleach
angry rantman sums it up
Classroom of the elite?
17:20 Goku jumpscare
24:06 why did you have to play the song man... why
10:15 I feel personally attacked
My name is Liam... I was watching this at midnight... how did he know??
The thing with made in abyss for me is that I actually randomly found it. And after like two or three episodes. I was screaming in my in my mind why is it that everyone is not talking about this.   Then I finished season one It took me four months to get the balls to watch season 2 this year and still i got crushed att the end.
eminence of shadow
call of night > lycoris recoil is crazy to me
so, you're a fan of macross 82-93
Doooooooooooooooooooood! Ur awesome!!!
Look at summer time render
Missed out Akiba Maid wars
He nailed the degen part
My whole time watching this list I was like "where's Made in Abyss?" I lost hope because NOBODY seems to rate it highly, especially since it wasn't on C-roll. Then it came out in the #1 on the list and I'm like FUCK YEAH!!!! LET'S GO BOY!!!!!! Can't wait for the manga to start going at ch 64 again.
Never in a million years thought I would see Mark Goldbridge in a Gigguk video
I really need to see made in abyss holy shit it looks soo good really don't know why I skipped it
Why Made in Abyss has so familiar background theme of Zankyou no Terror - because of Dan Arnor?
HIMENO FANS AAAA IM INE OF THEM
Season 1 of Mob Psycho stays undefeated. I liked first half of s2 but it kinda disappointed in the end.
Loved spy x family first 3 episodes but for me the enjoyment has spiraled down so much
I felt like this time around Demon Slayer was lacking but It was impossible not to enjoy purely because of that action and that animation. Kinda makes me wish they took over opm s3. They are probably about the only studio that can do chapter 166 and 167 mercy
"cmon its 3:AM what are you doing still watching youtube videos" its 4 PM for me tho
Hadn't this video released little earlier I would have not started my long journey of one piece  Edit :damn you
I think for me best anime of 2022 is Bleach, Lycoris Recoil, Kaguya, Love after world Domination, Dress up darling,  shield hero season 2, beast tamer and reincarnated as a sword
L
Another banger
I'm NGL the Jason Bourne bit had me dieing
5:12 Thanks for introducing to this great and fun anime. Watched your video yesterday and completed the whole season in 1 day.
What's the song at the 5:15?
Where's Ousama Ranking, Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen?
So glad someone finally talked about the writting for kaguya sama, imo the true brilliance of this show has always been akasaka aka's brilliant writting despite it being marketted as a comedy show
bad vid cause i had no idea how to spell the titles and ko bing kong ming doesnt help
8:28 love the mark goldbridge reaction clip.
Spy multipled by family is my favorite anime!
No cap, that WC Final was Hype, Greatest of all time
daym its 3 am you dongkey..wttfffff hahahahhahaha
I loveeeee spyx family. I laughed and laughed so many times im genuinely sad I have to wait for the next season
The intro to cyberpunk god damnnnn thats nice
Nope... For me Edgerunners just "ok", nothing more, nothing less. To high it's stands in your top. IMO.
After watching this, then watching Alain's vlog for the behind the scenes of this video and then watching this again I can totally agree that getting that Gundam for research is truly needed
Gay Girls in it.....this is what we needed to bring us together in 2022
Well Done! this video was soo damn good I don't even want to put it with my other liked videos, this was on another level!  I wish there was something more than a like for this video.... A SUBSCRIBE!!
Last year was fucking amazing.
Made in Abyss has been my number one since the anime came out in 2017. But it’s such a double edged sword when YouTubers like yourself promote it because I want it to continue but now the manga are crazy overpriced ever since you did your review
Garnt I love you for knowing Chinese that meme and reference as a Gaijin. That shit made me laugh my ass off  6:06
10:10  ... it's actually 4am Garnt...
Prushka died for our sins
Whens the next anime in minutes im craving it from all the gay girls innit
I was crying during the fight in Demon Slayer Entertainment District Arc. My mom came into the room and asked me why I was crying and I showed her. My mother, who doesn't like anime, *SAID THE ANIMATION WAS AMAZING!* Also as a Chainsaw Man manga reader.. *Be prepared.*
+1 Comment
mans really just hit us with the end section which i can only describe as ethereal, and then proceeds to go back to his usual upbeat tone
wait aot isnt in this?
Wait, he skipped Bleach... (biased👺)
~seeing what N°1 is~ "You're strong, you can endure that review without tearing up, had plenty of time to digest that season"😌.... 😔😭
just got called out for being a night owl by gigguk. achievement unlocked
WHERE IS JJOJOJOJOJ!!!???
Damn I just seen he posted a new video but now it's gone
Probably the first time i've disagreed with Gigguk on his selection, this video was a miss imo
"Boeing 747 carrying Belgium and Germany" had me dead 💀💀💀
aa fuck.. not the song again.. :')
i feel so called out
BOCCHI THE ROCKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
Might be a bit late... but do you not say the X in titles as 'times' rather than 'X'? Like a multiplaction symbol, but saying is as in a times table. Two times two is 4. Spy times Family is - this story!
To be honest, with every new season anime becomes more boring and dull. I remember how 10 years ago a pack of legends could be released in one season. A now we have about 1-3 okay anime in a year....mmmm
No but for real, I really wanna stay at your house still makes me cry.
Watch Kotaro Lives alone
Read dandadan please man
The only anime I actually made time for this year and it was #1. Wow. Guess I picked good haha
10:14 😅
anya from spyxfamily is so cute and funny!!!! uohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
Ah yes his voice 😎
When this first came out, I wondered how he could put Made in Abyss up there at #1, so I binge watched the whole thing. And dammit he's right.
Havent watched anime in a month by now because of burnout.. this video might just hook me back in 😂
anyone know what background music was used at around 14:00
i forget gigguk makes youtube
Gigguk never disappoints. Even if I watched most of these, I always enjoy hearing his spoiler free takes
Errrrrrr so - Jojo Stone Ocean didn't even make the list???? What??? I don't understand.
😂😂😂 so funny
Pls do the classroom of elite
24:00 true, I used to ignore that song when I ran across it in-game since EDM is not my jam, but ever since. Man the emotional damage is real.
As a huge Made in the Abyss fan I’m glad to see it get the love it deserves! In a anime community now with so many high budget productions and new shows, Made in the Abyss is like a quite master piece, in world full of noise. An only those willing to listen can truly feel it’s impact on the soul *sheds single tear*
Summertime Render(ing) was really damn good 👀 Fuck D0sney for locking it up
Holy shit perfect video
Kongming's strategy: using absurdity to get Grant Gigguk to watch an idol anime
Goddamn it he made me want to watch anime
if you are reading this you will lose your mom in the next five years, to prevent this cpy and pste this comment in other five animes sorry
20:47 most people of this because they have a similar title
such a strange top...
4:54 So Inazuma Eleven but Golf?
No mention of the best of the best show of 2022 immoral guild?  How can I ever take you seriously again
I see no overlord i sed.
Spy cross product Family
as soon as you played I really want to stay at your house tonight ,  I started crying all over again.. thanks Gigguk
25:45  how come some piano made me tears up and reach the pause button.. Like Made in Abyss hit ways too hard man,, way too hard
A good gigguk video, makes you laugh, gives great recommendations. Was constantly pausing to update my to-watch list
So i am sure that i will be hated for this but just my thought shouldnt eminence in shadow be here
10:13 was a personal attack
This list is soo bad, your taste its not good.. blue lock its first place
Ive been watching youtube and anime late at night since like 6th grade
Damn, legit got chills when I heard the Made in Abyss soundtrack
Biggest missing show here is Kotaro Lives Alone but I’ll def be checking out the picks I haven’t seen yet
I seem to always forget gigguk is siamese/from thailand his accent seems american 🇺🇸 (Very good video btw)
Weird enough, if I closed my eyes and just listen, I could think the segment on MiA was actually about The House in Fata Morgana.
jokes on you its six a.m. i woke up at dinner time
i don't even watch anime anymore, but I watch gigguk, thank you
L+RATIO dragonball top 1
Made in Abyss seems like a fever dream  Ngl though other than that anime the only one on this list I am personally interested in is the cyber punk one.
Thank you Garnt. This was amazing, though I'm still amazed how you can make a show I though was as simple and straightforward as can be so heartfelt and touching. Now I'm conflicted on what anime to watch next but honestly, I love seeing other people's opinions on seasonal anime so when Joey had stopped doing his seasonal checkup, I've always found myself coming back to your videos. Love these so much, love you and your content sm.
cyber punk was so good it introduced my chollo homie into anime
Beautiful conclusion
20:32 doujin artists begs to differ
Seeing my 2 favorite anime of the year rank in the top 4 makes me feel so proud. And I just caught up with made in abyss before watching this video, and now I realize it's ranked #1. Good stuff
The weak "Ao Ashi" vs the Chad "Blue Lock"
Best Anime that was a complete suprise for me, was Ya boy konming
13:22 girls friendship type anime in a nutshell for me(honestly it hard to find good girls only anime with a fanbase yurifiy it)
Hey Gigguk -- or should I say Garnt. Since you are now finally caught up to One Piece and love it, I am hoping for a video about the King of Manga on the main channel. Please and thank you.
4:17- 5:07 it called the Virgin Mary for a reason
damm the predicted soo hard its 3 04 here
I cannot for the life of me understand why gigguk placed made in abyss at nr 1 spot. Season 1 was good, but season 2 felt so disconnected from season 1 and felt like it drifted towards a completely different purpose. Half of the time i didnt even understand what was going on, so confusing to follow along, season 2 just lost me completely. Tbh season 2 felt like one of the most boring binges in anime for me.
dope list
7:06 What do you get? Gunslinger Girls Sorry nothing new here
Just finished Garnt‘s 2022 video after watching Funshiki‘s 2022 anime recap. I love both of their styles and would love to see them both talk about anime sometime. The two biggest anime-content (video) creators in the West and in China coming together would probably make for an awesome conversation!
made in abyss is truly a 10/10 i have never watched something so amazing
without exaggration: most overrated anime ever -> mob pyscho.
just watching the made in abys part gave me goosebumps without having watched season 2 yet...
I need gigguk talking about eminence in shadow 💀
10:45 what is the name of this anime ? And the clip after it from, the ones with 2 women in uniforms
We are the watcher we cannot interfere
Summer time rendering is overrated in opinion it’s just basic with generic characters especially the villian but nice animation
he says spy ecs family
This comment is probably gonna get lost in the soup, but whatever;   I was lucky enough to contribute a tiny bit towards this season of Made in Abyss, and the love the show is getting is incredible. I was a fan of season 1 when it came out, and being able to have worked on season 2 was a huge point of personal pride, and seeing everyone loving it is equally incredible. I only put a little bit of work into the show but it makes me insanely proud to see where it is and how it's moving people. Anime of the year hands down, great work Gigguk.
W call of the night fr
demon slayer is one of the best i ever saw
we won against argentine weird world cup
Bleach ☠️
No "I AM ATOMIC" ???
Dude wtf it is exactly 2:59Am that is great
Keane Reaves 🤣🤣
I like me a girl that stinks good
Made in abyss season two was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen
Sad music makes me happy. Don't judge me.
I love your videos/edits brother and respect you as a content creator but MADE IN ABYSS !!!! THANK YOU!!!  That makes you the real one man fuck ya ! stay up much love -Jims
You may want to check the history of Cicciolina. The Italian-Hungarian adult actress, who was elected to the Italian parliament in 1987.
Chainsaw man was everything I'd hoped it to be. Kind of a faded take ngl
Ranking of kings
Did u guys know the manga where a princess and her vassels are reincarnated as high school students and they still dream of their past lives.
how the isekai man himself did not mention eminence in the shadow is a war crime.
I love this video.   The sad part is crunchyroll did #2 dirty. never trust crunchyroll.
Eminence in the shadow still the best anime of 2022 and You can't change my mind
Made in Abyss is definitely deserving of the #1 Spot. Overall great list.
Having watched only season one of Made in Abyss (an unforgettably intense and bizarrely wonderful experience), I closed my eyes and only listened to Gigguk's description for the second season. His description, as well as the overlay of an emotional Kevin Penkin tune that I'd never heard before, compelled me to tears because they elicited all of those emotions that I felt years ago when I saw the original season. The despair, the hope, the trauma, the love, and the delicate dance that intertwines those themes came through in this video, even with my eyes closed. I now know what I'm watching tonight. I need to stretch my emotional legs and hop onto the Made in Abyss feels-train once again. I know that it'll hurt, but that's what makes Abyss so special. Thanks, Garnt.
Bruhhhhh where is JJBA Stone Ocean part 3 ???!!! IT was AMAZINGG! Or AOT???
Why u don’t talk about my dress up darlin why dude
❤️
SPY FAMILY IS OVERRATED TRASH
Gay Girls Innit?  -Gigguk
Thks gigguk! u had to make an already catching song even more sticky right!?  Been a fews days already but i still can't take the penis out of my head!!
I'm so glad he put made in abyss at number 1. I haven't heard nearly enough talk about it. As someone who wasn't too impressed by season 1, season 2 was something truly special
i'm looking for the Liam that was awake until 3 am
How can someone be such a rational anime reviewer, such a incredible scriptwriter, and a memelord at the same time. You're killing it, Garnt!!
Didn’t expect to see Danny Aarons in a Gigguk video
Also why do they keep coming out with so many "Final" Fantasy games?
that FIFA WC 2022 part *ummma THE BEST part. hands down.
Giving Made in Abyss the #1 slot is big wow. It hit so damn hard. It was so good and ya, so much more than I expected in unexpected ways. Not sure if any show has hit me that hard, but its so hard to actually recomend due to what it is. Well spoken.
W vid
Just hearing the ost of made in abyss, makes me feel everything again 🥺
Nah all my homies hate Makima
NO IMMORTAL LIFE OF A DEMON KING????
What is the song you used in the intro to number 11?
disappointed akiba maid war didnt make it on this list
"gay girls" init... I am pissing myself mate. Think this is the best one yet
Blue lock betta
I always thought the big three was Naruto, DBZ, and One Piece when I was younger
Gotta say, I never really wanted to start Gundam because I knew it was gona be a mess to get into, but I just finished the witch from Mercury and... It was one of the best anime I watched the whole year. Now I'm gona close myself in my basement for a while and try to figure out what gundam I should watch next and in what order, because this shit is confusing. Although I think I can manage. After all, I'm a fate fan.
10:08 what a timing, its 3:01 when he said this and i'm indeed watching a youtube video

Congrats on the wedding Gigguk. Whish you and your best girl a life filled with love, happiness and anime.
Those glassess look great, anybody know the model?
I've heard many speeches but the Made in Abyss one was by faaaar your best one Gigguk, really, such a amazing speech, i could not agree more Made in Abyss is special and deserve so much! Honestly it made me tear up a bit, hehe.
14:17 why so deep
What was the 19:45 soundtrack from again?
Damn, after the made in Abyss movie, I'm not sure I'm ready for the mental anguish of season 2
"Boeing 747 carrying both Belgium and Germany" 😭😂💀💀 lmfao didn't expect that at all, snorted at work lol
Nah, Made in Abyss seasons 2 is FUCKED. If I lived in that universe I'd hijack the nearest possible B2 bomber and nuke that hole back to the dinosaurs.
Did not expect made in abyss at first place but that's exactly waht i wanted
Someone needs to get their eyes👀 checked man really said 2 great "football"🏈 animes
now i wanna watch anime i haven't watch in this list
How does gigguk doesnt get a copyright(s) for music or clips that he uses 🥺👉👈
If you have to type out the X in a title.. you say it too.
It was exactly 303 am at 10:34... I'm at work, but still
the fuck, i'm in a video mom
YOU FORGOT EMINENCE IN SHADOW!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
That hiroyuki sawano score for the new gundam. Fuck me its good. Ever since gundam UC hiroyuki sawano just KEEPS TOPPING THEMSELVES WITH THE KICK ASS MUSIC WITH EVERY NEW GUNDAM
The true number 1 is eminence in shadow
Osama ranking ?? Crazy it didn't make it top 6 at least
10:14 fuck thats actually my name lmao
did you really just call demon slayer mid?  Because if so you trippin and im really bouta slay them cheeks in a second
made in abyss is the most beautiful anime ive ever seen in my life. Amazing piece of work.
Great video. I don’t think I’m brave enough to watch Made in Abyss. I’m scared of the emotions I think it would subject me to.
I am surprised he didn't mention at least something about One Piece. Like, OP fans had such a hype year. We got roof piece, zoro's kyuutoryu ashura bakkei: moja no towamure into kaido getting a scar from the attack, and we even got to see Luffy coating his arms in conquerors haki (and of course more big titties). They even managed to get us to the point where we start the year off with king/queen vs zoro/sanji, luffy's return to the roof, big boy momo, and this year we will expect to see one of the biggest scenes in OP history. People say that it will break the internet, but there's no way it'll happen seeing as nothing is gonna match ui goku's debut.
Bocchi the Rock (left me dying for more) and Witch of Mercury were both amazing shows (I cannot wait for the 2nd part). Both were amazing in my eyes
is it "Gay girls in it," or "Gay girls, innit?"  Or both?
Let’s go! MIA #1!
Are you not going to make a video about this gem in raw?  Yeah that's right I'm talking about sakamoto days. A perfect mix of chainsaw man action and the wholesome fun of spyxfamily. Also another underrated manga called " Koko Kara ima rinri desu " or from now we begin ethics. A manga we needed right now with the state of all the issues of society.
Thank you so much for giving Made in abyss the respect it deserve. This anime is the only anime that broke my spectrum of emotion. I walked into the anime with the notion "oh, this is just another anime portraying adulthood life stage through children-like characters" I was right but yet so wrong. To all you newcomers to this anime, don't be scared!!!
Dude got married? Congratulations!
Too much fan service. Not what I was looking for.
You forgot about Tatami Time Machine Blues.
How to ask to subscribe, without asking for a subscribe !
To watch the anime such as made in abyss you have to be in the special mood,thats why I prefer Bochi the rock...
bocchi actually does have gay girls in it lmao
summer time rendering was fire
Really Gigguk? Pocchi > Chainsaw Man? ...and Summertime Render so low? I'm hurt.
I wonder if he could do a video on “survival of a sword king in a fantasy world”
Where is Stone Ocean ?
Fuck chainsaw man bocchi ROCKS
As a fellow Isekai junkie, u gotta watch War-God system I'm counting on you. It's hilarious
MY FAV 2022 1.Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury 2.Bocchi The Rock 3.Chainsaw Man 4.Made in Abyss 5.Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
no jojo :'(
LOL i got jebaited to watch idol anime as well Koming is dope af (and I'm on episode 1)
I’ve been trying to figure out how I’ve felt about Made in Abyss S2. Thanks for putting it into words :)
you are the best
3.22am got called out at 10:08
Of course you should give Disney your money. Life without Disney is pointless.
i gotta sleep
Summertime Rendering was my stand out number 1 this year for non-sequels, its a crime that its hidden behind disney+, everyone I have recommended it has raved about it.
Great 👍🏻 video nice 👍🏻 hype!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fucking editing in this video was god tier.
Demon slayer s2 looked good. But was bad writing. He stopped his heart so poison stopped working it makes no sense, he grew up in the mountains so poison doesnt work it makes no sense, and the Demon destroyed the city but somehow noone died that is BS.
I really really really wanted to like "Made in Abyss". The soundtrack, art, and story were so good I thought it would be my favorite. I quit watching because they constantly sexualize the little kid main characters. Not a little bit, a lot. This isn't unusual for anime so I tried to just power through and ignore it, but it ruined the immersion so many times during the show. I wasn't really that bothered by its existence, but mostly the frequency. It was the one thing that felt super forced and annoyed me so much that it ruined the whole show.  Maybe I'll come back to it becasue I assume that as the plot gets thicker they'll spend less time doing that.
Made in Abyss was so emotionally devastating that I fought back tears after just listening to that piano melody.
you dont understand. ever since watching kaguya-sama:love is war I CANT STOP GIGGLING EVERY TIME ITS MENTIONED ITS CRAZY
Honestly I feel like Made in Abyss jumped shark after the movie. Season 2 felt pretty mid and the child suffering gave me diminishing returns.
Made in abyss makes you feel like a helpless baby with the consciousness of an adult. The mysteries and the cruelness of the world is vast. It is scary and intimidating, but the innate curiosity of the mind makes you want to explore and discover it.
Thanks for the shoutout @ 10:14
Hopefully they give us either 4 or 3 season of chainsaw man cause if I swear that assassin arc isn’t a season it self I’m gonna be pissed off. Bro if they put bomb devil arc mashed with assassin arc bro that gonna suck cause it’s gonna rush stuff cause the caps 12 episode a season usually.
Summertime render... On disney.... Wait what? Why would Disney want that?
It's nice to see someone Express the same level of feels towards made in abyss. So excited to see the mystery that will be the next season.
I want to say where the hell is one piece butts. It’s not as good as it used to be.
feel like everybody forgot about sonny boy
Mappa or DP has to make a berserk adaptation
What's the background song during Cyberpunk's section?
Gigguk is good dad or father figure now
Paripi koumei is underrated af
Sometimes I'm violently reminded that Gigguk is British when he says horrendous words like "innit".
Damn he's good
Gigguk has to watch eminence in shadow. It’s a prime shitpost with some of the best animation I’ve ever seen. It’s great how much I hate it
@strixify sent me
Why can't your taste in anime be as good as the editing in your videos?
thank u for including...Call Of The Night... it's just a VIBE...
I never recommend anime after watching just one episode. The only time I broke that rule was when I watched Made in Abyss season 1. I had been waiting for Kevin Penkin soundtrack for many years. When I saw the first episode of season 2, I thought to myself dude this is a masterpiece-its just perfect! I believe Made in abyss is probably not for everyone but if you like it, you like it. I don't have any doubts that its a masterpiece. And if you love anime, you need to support such artists. Shout out to Muse YT channel for supporting and free streaming Made In Abyss S2. And as always to my favorite YT anime reviewer Gigguk, keep it rolling brother!
The Boeing joke was foul. Red card
North-America catching strays
As always, wonderful video! Love the way you deliver your content. Tears to my eyes multiple times as usual. <3
I really need Witch From Mercury to continue... That cliffhanger man... so fucking brutal...
wher's jojo :0
Chainsaw Man, Spy X Family, Demon Slayer, Mob Psycho, Attack on Titan, JoJo Stone Ocean, and Dragon Ball Super Super Heroes. My jam! 😁
Call of the Night is mid and idgaf what you nxggas say.
What's the song at 19:40 ??
2023's list is gonna have a lot of gay girls ain't it?
I'm watching this at 11:30 am. So suck it >=D
no 14 anime name
Chainsaw man is already a 10/10
This video was amazing. The comedy and editing was fantastic and the feedback on these shows was so well-said. I don't know how I haven't found your content yet, but say hi to a new subscriber!
My god they really are twins or rather the "Netflix adaptation"
Love the little collab between Goldbridge and Gigguk
you put two soccer shows on this thing and didn't have room for komi? tsk
The kaguya segment had me in my feels lmao. Literally smack dab in the target audience generationally for your mentions for the genres introductions... My intro to anime as a whole was Azumanga Daioh...
Made In Abyss 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
Chainsaw man expectation is like expecting a man run as fast as a jet, but he could only run as fast as a bullet train.
me and my friend go crazy for Mod 100
Bochi the rock diagnosed XD
Bleach Hate is real 😅
Gay girls innit
Didn't Gigguk make a rant video about CGDCT? If so, where can I find it? Did he delete it?
*MADE IN ABYSS*  *You're welcome.*
Best anime of 2022? Attack on Titan and Bleach.... End the video.
I just love wqtching anime
Shadows House was ignored by everyone during its own season so I'm not surprised it's not on this video. For me its the true hidden gem of 2022 compared to Summertime Rendering. Not in the sense it's better but rather how no big youtuber talked about it despite the show being amazing.
i got introduced to anime by apreggio of blue steel ,kantai collection, and high school DXD
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is it exactly 3:02am as I watch this video !!!!!!   😮
Yo idk but you forgot the STONE FREE
We need more Shoujo
Beautiful Game nods and mems injected into Top Anime LIst? Your Mum jokes? Result!  Thank you.
how long does this video took to edit?
Gigguk's 2023 Video be Like "38 Anime makes this the longest list I've made so far"
LOL 11:20 is literally just re zero
Mob psycho 100 is a real masterpiece with great story plot, top tier animations, and most importantly, the best character development I ever had. It has accompanied me from my secondary school life till university. All the tears I shed and all the great memories I had with this show. Thank you so much for inspiring me to improve myself and be a better person. I would really recommend everyone to check it out. Top-tier show I guarantee!
10:15 Unless you're in America, which is accurate.
Great vid 10/10….. 26:46 non euclidian (you-klid-ee-uhn)
25:41 The way that Made in Abyss' OST immediately triggered my Pavlovian conditioning to start crying really attests to the emotional experience this anime was for me. It's such a powerful anime and I love it T-T Happy that you agree!
Some of the stuff you said about mob requires a down vote. You don't understand the crisp beauty of Mob!
bond is best dog
After going through season 1 of Made in Abyss, I can officially say I am not brave enough to venture into season 2.
The entire Made In Abyss section culminating in 27:28 is some damn fine piece of writing, presentation and editing. Serious kudos, you gave me real chills :')
dang, gotta watch made in abyss 2.  Getting compared to Requiem for a Dream says alot.
mans makes anime sound so cool
What was 14?  Total waste of countdown
What a year
BOCCHI THE GODDDDDDDDDDDD
Great vid! But all I took away from it is: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
Can someone tell me what the melody is for 24:35
we all know lesbians make everything better
“Gay girls in it” is my favorite quote now
Top 17 and there is no Shadows House? Bruh
This guy is just unmatched ain't he. So relatable, so humorous and when he describes how certain anime make him or one feels you can't help but feel the same way. Always touching, always spectacular.   Edit: just rewatched this and the Edgerunners bit hit even harder. Ah man.
God the wait for Chainsaw Man season 2 is going to kill me
26:45 does anyone know what "non-usidian" means? It's not a term I've come across before and I'm not sure if Garnt misspoke
Why isnt bleach on the top?
Tbh... i might've started watching romance anime from 2. Domestic girlfriend and 3d kanojo lol
Ngl your anime round up is my yearly therapy.
Did Garnt not watch One Piece episode 1015? He can't have to have omitted it from this.
请问一下作者可以出《中二病也要谈恋爱》的恶搞配音吗？
1:17 am
Made In Abyss was the only anime that I was glad came out in a weekly format because it emotionally wrecked me and I doubt I could have survived binging it. Also Aldnoah Zero was the mecha anime refresh that I needed personally.
YESSSSS VENDING MACHINE ISEKAI!!!!!! I AM READY!!!!
Deng I thought witch from Mercury only 1 season now I'm hook with Gundam dammit
Can i low key ask where bleach is?
IM SO GLAD CPER MADE IT!
Neat
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BLEACH???
I just watched a 30 Minute Video  from a random person in the internet and it was FUNNY.  Didn't even realised I was sitting here for half an hour. 😊
I can’t believe I’ve been called out like this 10:16
I feel targeted
Call of the night manga starts with its main arc once the second season releases then shits gonna get hype!
The fact that Spy x Family is super popular shows how terrible anime community has become. Cyberpunk was awesome but ending was bad and held down. Eminence in the shadows is interesting but has a serious problem. Too much talking fillers in each episode. Holly shit. Only good thing was a adaptation following chainsaw man manga through and through. I tried watching automata but it was just a recap of the game itself so fuck off. I tired some spy copy of Spy X Family. It was good until little girl came and destroyed the entire show. It's still better then most years of what they had but still mostly trash. I just know that most of my friends were dissapointed in Attack of titan so eh. I don't like that show. It was bad after season 1 finished.
the cut to the monkey with the cigarette had me creasing up
Holy shit killed it this time gigguk
Rust eater bisco was one of my favorite this year
Lycoris recoil deserves to be 1, and I assume the only reason it wasn't was because Kadokawa didn't make it. Call of the night sucks and is super boring. Dress up turd is fine but just like every romance anime.
Edgerunners leaving me traumatized with a song and Made in Abyss for leaving me broken for everything else.
Exactly the reason why I'm an Anime Fan
I'm so glad Bocchi the Rock is on here~ I love this anime so much!!!
Started watching anime this year with demon slayer.  Loved every  moment of it and hyped as S3 is just around the corner. All I have to say other than that is Chainsaw man extremely overrated.
where is aot ?
2022 was really for the gay girls 😂
lmao kudos to put Mark Goldbridge bit there
How to make an anime good  Gay girls init
I was expecting Aot on no.1
BLEACHHHHH
I would like to see a same list every year of Hamine too please mate...
Mbappe Real goat with Ronaldo
Gigguk!! The amount of goosebumps and satisfaction u give me was imesurable.
So basically chainsaw man, man you say you hate sappy slice of life but your lists are always full of them
That gundam music had me on tears bro
@gigguk ahh dude. 10:15 actually made me drop my fucking jaw.. it’s 12:14am and my name is fucking Liam. Stick a fork in me I’m done
Another fckin amazing video gigguk, actually not. Your vid just kept on improving in quality its insane. On a side note, I'm def not gonna watch made in abyss anytime soon, I want to watch something fun and happy, not sad and depressing that'll give me  a rollercoaster of emotion
9:30 does anyone know the song that starts playing here?
If you want to see real cute girls with guns go watch Gunslinger Girl.
The editing is absolute masterpiece
25:41 The second the music started playing I knew what was coming. That's how you know a phenomenal soundtrack.
I have loved every Gigguck recap or nutshell yet 😭 Everytime one releases, it's like a holiday for me
Just the picture od ANYA on the vidéo is masterpiece
28:38 The one word should have been "trauma".
Is it just me or did anyone else try most of these show and go " These are amazingly well made shows, but I think I'll just watch some trash isekai instead."?
Where the tir list of the waifu is updated P.S. just try to put the Asuna below A post 1
still waiting for gigguk to review sakamoto days…
I enjoyed season 1 of made in abyss but never checked out s2 because it didn’t make much noise in the community so I assumed it must’ve not been very good. Guess I’ll hav to find time to check it out
Gigguk nonchalantly made a really good edit in the first segment of the video lol
Maid in Abyss. The only anime that has ever given me a panic attack.
im still wating for Mushoko Tensei season 2
*B O R F*
WATCH 'THROWN OF SEAL'..ITS SOO GOOD SEE IT YOURSELF..its not fully uploaded yet tho
5/17 anime I actually watched.  I still don't know if my tastes are getting worse, I can't even relate to the anitubers.
28:41 which song is this??
6:13 I never thought a man outside china would know this meme
The Heike Story / Heike Monogatari
Can't believe you didn't mention the squish at the end of witch from Mercury
edgerunners still pains me even today idk how to cope
glad u actually still watch anime lol, like no offense to others but that’s why i was originally here yk
Is Call of Night worth it? Anyone?
2022 was an absolute banger
3rd year in a row guessing the number 1 anime.  Wait is that a good thing!?
How is Classroom of the elite s2 not non here
Mark goldbridge 💀
Bleach, AOT, cote, jojo etc are missing from this list
Peak tierlist nothing can beat this
Nah it’s 5AM
Congratulations on your marriage!! 🥳🥳
L BOCCHI THE ROCK (DWAYNE BETTER)
ever year i swear is  the same thing we can't stop watching it so we every year decide o watching more
10:08 how do you know im watching this at exactly 3AM 😨😭😭
CSM hell and graveyard hits stoopid hard
Gay girls innit counter: 4 :D
I don't know why but i cry every time i watch gigguk's videos
grats grant garnt
Gonna watch some stuff now. Always look forward to your end year videos.
The made in abyss songs are; Old Stories  Reg & his Interference Unit By kevin penkin
Demon Slayer was god tier simply because of the Tengen and Gyutarou fight. I get chills every single time because of the buttery smooth choreography and that SOUNDTRACK OH MY GODDD
hey dude, i don't know if you'll get the chance to read this but i want to thank you for these lists you do. Sometimes i fear my interest in anime is waning, but this is the second time you've pointed me to something that i overlooked and ended up blowing away my expectations. I never would have watched bocchi the rock, but just wow. Thanks a lot.
My Dress-Up Darling was great, but i understand some of the backlash against it. Its a prime example of an anime where they could have just made the characters older and it wouldn't have taken anything away from the story. Looking forward to a S2 though
Made in Abyss 2 was such of waste of fucking time lol     Jerking off and rehashing the same ideas presented in the first season, making characters even more stupid, and doing melodramatic shit for the sake of it is irritating. It used none of the intrigue and mystery that first season lured you in with. So much wasted time with crying over and over and over and over about the things that we've ALL got already super familiar with. I'm not gonna be surprised if in the third season or the next move there will be 10 minutes specifically to make Bunny girl cry over Mitty again, and then a couple of flashbacks. The only consistency kept with the first season is "WoOoOoOooOo Mysterious hole", unironically, if you were to skip this season completely, and move onto whatever will be next, and assume that the Pod thing just got down even further to the entering of the 7th layer instead, you'd lose Nothing of *value*, because this same exact torture-porn has been already explored enough in the  first season, and in the season is just viewed from a little different angle. No new discoveries about the world have been made, nothing interesting happened, every good new character is killed off JUST BECAUSE  The entire season feels like a string of random events, random anomalies, and random decisions from the characters, from top to bottom, mystery for the sake of mystery, grotesque torture porn for the sake of it. It does nothing interesting, it changes nothing in the narrative. Why is Made in abyss as a whole so far up top is beyond my understanding, when literally every other show with somewhat similar plot structure are way better then this waste of time
SORRY IM LATE CONGRATS ON YOUR MARRIAGE BRO THIS IS AWESOME
Marin/Syd best girl
ah yes, gay girls innit.
My friend made the spy mulltipled by family video lmao
Oka bruh, get it. My stomach and cheeks can't take this anymore. Glad I'm alone or I'm going to be looking like a lunatic.  Great video, thanks. Keep up the good work!
damn best picks ever
can't wait for them to split part 1 into two or three parts
20:32 This is just the Female version of “Given”
How can you put edge runner above chainsaw man is a mystery to me....
Great Video! The only thing that it's missing is an honorable mention for an isekai as not a single one made the list or was mentioned :) (Though I do remember at least one brief isekai still image)
someone list the anime mentioned?
9:36 ill be honest I really dont see it
CRINGE
28:07 I'm sorry I still have not recovered from Your lie in April
Banger Vid, always love coming back to these recaps, the wit and the hahas never fail to make me smile.  Now, I might add that this video is the first for me, in which my name is uttered nonchalantly. I feel seen and accepted, but this also marks the start of me probably hearing my name more often, and I don't know if I can handle it. It being shouted across parks and shops to stop little stubby legged buggers from turning into an Isekai-Protagonist. I thought it was special, but I guess I stay up till 3 in the morning watching anime compilations. Damn.
Fucking hell I love Made in Abyss so much. You've described my feelings for it very well.
uhhh 9:19 that hurt germany
Isn't "sound" late over most of video? Especially visible on transition between ranks
Fun thing: Spy x Family is, in fact, our Sunday night family anime. We all have freakishly different anime tastes but we all- siblings, parents, and spouses, love this show.
I'm disappointed Gigguk skipped the slavery subplot in the worldcup
One piece Live action ?
9:54  watching in 19 20 but still can relate
Just pure peak fiction 🥶
I just wish the brilliant mangaka behind Made in Abyss finishes the damn story already before his hard drive full of unspeakable things happening to children (for research) gets discovered.
Man hearing any  of the made in abyss ost makes me cry
26:00 The perfect example is FRICKING OMORI THIS SHIT WENT SO HARD THAT I HAVE THE FINALE SONG IN MY PHONE
24:04 literally me for weeks
It would have helpful to label the time stamps with anime names...
Love that you’re still championing MiA.  Sooooo good
Where is AOT S4 part2 dude
my face when when you mentioned my name during the call of the night segment. as i been following the manga and i am a night owl typa person 😭
where is eminence in shadow?????
You just sold me on checking out Made In Abyss
oooh yeah only made in abyss should be top 1
lmao
chinese censored chainsaw man
Cid Kagenou rn be like: Heh that's what I expect from my ultimate mob-fu arts!😏
23:58
Gigguk is not getting copyrighted after all those soothing OST is something I noticed and should be appreciating as well, honestly.
Still no shadows house mention😩
Anyone knows if t he video was edited at some point? it seems to go horrible off sync during Call of the night. Only when casting it to another device.
The year 2022 may have been one of the most whack ass years ever. But I can't deny this was a fantastic fucking year for anime. This year (technically last year) the anime studios really pulled out all the stops and hit us with series after series of god tier entertainment. I'm very concerned for the health and sanity of the animators though. God rest their underpaid tired as fuck souls.
Where is Bleach ?
Where is bleach?
Watch the Slam Dunk Movie man please. Its super HYPE
How the hell is Isekai Ojisan not on this list!! Such a shame from a so called OG Anime Fan 🤔
What a great writer !
boch the rock sucks, and this come from a introvert... her exagerations are to cringe, and not in a good way
25:57
Kubo-san. The diabetes of this year.
2022: My Anime, your anime, our *Anime*
Can’t believe I got called out by gigguk half way into his video. Because I am indeed watching YouTube at 3 am 😂.
This man called me out at 3 A.M. 😭😭
Why everytime im watching your videos i feel so emotional
I can't agree more  Marin is the best girl of 2022
Feels bad. Bleach's comeback was goated.
studio trigger making something non space related... shit she went to the moon!
The vibes from this video were something else. The shows this year were unbelievably good but your description of and understanding of each individual character and the world within a show were powerful. I enjoyed it, it was humorous, it was dark, it was beautiful.. this video made me feel an unexplained emotion. At the end of this video, I felt like I sat through watching a whole ass movie about a man and his love and feelings of anime. Thank you.
The fact he didn't even mention Bleach TYBW arc hurt me 😔 great list nonetheless
_gaygirlsinnit_
Read dandadan please
I love all these video keep them up , anime 2023 about to be even crazier💯
This 2022 year is one of the golden year of anime like so many new anime shows,trailers ,new anime upcoming news like we don't have time to breath after performing (hinokami kagura) means so many chaos going Like almost every anime Giguk talked everyone saw almost half of them
no bleach??! :(
26:46 non-whatnow?
Bro is a whole month late for this video
Your jokes were super on point this video, the Jason Bourne and Door to Darkness both got me chuckling for several minutes.   Witch from Mercury is how i finally got a friend of mine to start watching Gundam, they are now hooked and it makes me very happy
13:17 *never
Edgerunners is definitely my favourite show of the year. Absolutely blew me away
Not an Isekai 🎉
Creepy nuts fucking KILLED that soundtrack
Kagejitsu was the most underrated show of this year, an isekai *parody* that manages to satire every trope you've ever heard of and does it so well many people assumed that it was being serious, and then has an actually pretty cool subplot.
Garnt stepping up let's go !!!
God damn, it took 3 seconds of *that cyberpunk song* to get me crying again tf
GAY GIRL'S INIT !!! Age of yuri is upon us with such great hits as Birdie Wing, Lycoris Recoil , Gundam Witch of Mercury and now MagiRevo !!! (Magical Revolution ) All damn bangers
honestly 90% of what came out last year wasn't even good its just EVERYTHING was overhyped
Cyberpunk is my favorite media ever now, my number 1 over any movie or TV show. I've watched it 5 times and cry every fucking time. Nothing hits me harder...
Garnt validated it bocchi solo the best
The fact I was actually watching this video at 3 am... Then the part about yofukashi no uta pulls up and I'm just like 👁️👄👁️
Bro where is Eminence in shadow
Yes, made in abyss, for you guys not know…..this anime was very interesting to me at first when i saw it! Literally when i see a whole map of fucking abyss, i Was HYPE. idk why i was but ya. Then somehow there a 2 SEASON BRO LIKE I WAS MORE HYPE THAN EVER!  Please watch the show if you haven’t done it yet!   Respect 🫡
"Gay Girls ain't it"
Your writing is really hitting it's peak. Married life suits you well my friend.
So glad you mentioned made in Abyss. Felt like it was flying under the radar! Its an experience!
Mon Psycho season 3 is easily the best
Trash list. Summertime Render should be top 5
Bro everyone saw episode 8 of Lycoris Recoil, and instantly became a Thigh Guy💀
OK, i'm tryna find a good series to sleep to, got work hella early. I skip it 10 secs, and my dude gigguk says my name im crying
finally here! long awaited video!  I'm a little sad that The Eminence in Shadow didn't get into the list but it's still good.  2022 was such a great year.
A thousand times YES to Made in Abyss in the first place!
How the fuck do you keep getting funnier, we didnt think it was possible dude.
This is ur best work gigguk thankyou so much for including made in abyss respect you so much
Made in Abyss just hits different.
<3
wtf the Witch of Mercury music did NOT need to make me feel like that out of no where
Ya boi was top tier
Its gonna be boring? Problem solved, gay girls innit
No bleach? 👎
Gay girls inmit
Where is Isekai Ojiisan
When you came to number 1 and the made in abyss soundtrack started playing, I almost cried.
Amazing video man. Absolutely perfect. 👏
Can't wait til the fandom find out true Makima and why she likes Denji. I'd pay to see the reaction 🤣
Absolutely agree with #1.  Its an incredible one I won't soon forget and the best ost  possibly I have heard since the last thing Hans Zimmer did. I'm going with Witch from Mercury as my #1 from 2022 simply because I will probably rewatch it. I will probably never rewatch Abyss S2, Incredible as it is. I might be bias cause I love mecha tho.   Great comparison to Requiem to a Dream btw. I have never rewatched that movie but remember it vividly. Looking forward to another year of great ones. Isekai Ojisan might finish this year. Maybe.
I work night shift. Thats why I am awake at 3 AM.  Also when he said "Unless you're in America" I felt that.
MIA number 1? Gigguk never disappoints.
I would be interested to hear, was Sabuki Bisco considered for this list?
Wish I could afford a Bokksu :(
Made in Abyss S1: Oh this looks like a cute  adventure anime, ok. Wait, that was weird, why would you say that in a show for children, well, whatever. Wait, no, oh my god WTF NO! Made in Abyss Movie: Huh, wasn't this guy supposed to be evil? Seems pretty cool and friendly to me... Huh, oh, oh no, OH MY GOD WTF, KILL HIM! KILL HIM! Made in Abyss S2: I know your tricks now, you won't trick me this time. "30 seconds into the first episode" JESUS CHRIST WTF! Already!?
6:08 this is a legend of a meme in the Chinese community xD
8:03 Dress up darling starts out well enough but goes nowhere, there actually isn't any romance in the entire season, if this is supposed to be a good example of romance anime then I will happily skip the entire genre.
Wdym n1??? Made in abyss s2 was ass...
why are you hyping up the quatar world cup -_- made me salty
What anime was 14? For science...
darnnn, the soundtrack at 27:45 is hitting me to the core...
I always get hyped whenever Gigguk uploads a new video! Another fantastic video my man
Guys nr 11 has a finished manga on mangaplus and it seems better. Also, I salute the transition to nr 1. Bro
I finished made in abyss, wich is the only anime i've watched yet,with the 1.5 season/movie, all in one day. It called back to everyone i've lost, and my way of practicing my religion. So i just rushed to see the top 1 on the video, whilst ignoring the rest, thinking there was no way it wasn't number one. I wasn't wrong.
Spoiler for the video       When i saw number 2 in the list and it's not made in abyss, i was sad i was sad A LoOOT Then i prayed that please give it the place it deserves And oh ma lord I heard the music and it was as if Argentina was won the world cup again. Fucking love made in abyss love it love it love it.............(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
16:25 I'm gonna fucking watch it now  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
February lesgooo
*My all time best is one piece … I am eagerly waiting for kaidos defeat … who are all with me ??*
How can a man so wrong be so right
should have talked about rent-a-girlfriend.
Boochi the rock and summertime render hands down were probably one of the best new gen anime we have gotten
Wow so many other good ones too! What a good year
What’s #6 ? I don’t understand the name
9:48danny arrons be fumin 😭😂
Bro this is some peak content 😂😂 I'm dying here 🤣🤣🤣
Didn't enjoyed these so called "masterpieces"
Gigguk is still Gigguk, still deliver high quality anime content like this but chick with guns deserve a spot in this list made me question about my taste
God I got goosebumps at certain points This guy definitely would be a good door to door salesman
I love call of the night
LOL the sydney reference
what are some animes that are like darling in the franxx?
I'm kinda Surprise that Ousama Ranking didn't make into the list
My only problem with this videos and with gigguk being an absolutely unparallelled hype machine is that they make me realize how much I'm missing out and how little time I have to watch all this stuff.
Spoilers:     Intro 0:00 17- 4:14 | Birdie Wing 16- 5:10 | Ya Boy Kongming! 15- 6:51 | Lycoris Recoil 14- 8:01 | My Dress-Up Darling 13+12 - 8:14 | Aoashi & Blue Lock 11- 9:47 | Call of the Night 10- 10:55 | Summer Time Rendering 9- 12:14 | Demon Slayer 8- 13:32 | Spy X Family 7- 14:36 | Gundam the Witch from Mercury 6- 16:37 | Love is War 5- 18:21 | Chainsaw Man 4- 20:28 | Bocchi the Rock! 3- 22:53 | Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2- 24:25 | Mob Psycho 1- 25:57 | Made in Abyss
People always ask me why i love gigguk review and all of his videos.. I gave simple answer.. "Lesbian in it"
cant believe he put mark goldbridge in this hahahah
25:57 this has been my ringtone for quite some time.
I agree with no 1 soooo much
Nothing beats Garnt's script-writing, I could watch this kind of videos for hours.
i feel called out cause im watching this at 3am. LMAO
Moral of the story, get girl in it
I'm really  happy that you put Bocchi the rock  so high, I think that it's the most absolutely awesome thing that happened last year. It was funny as hell
ランキングけっこう意外な結果だったなあ でもメイドインアビスが1位なのは納得だわ
27:40 when that soundtrack was played at full blast I felt a type of shiver that I've NEVER FELT BEFORE. If I were to every watch this show, best believe its for the music
As an editing fan 22:53 HOLY SHIT THATS SOME GOOD SHIT
Once again you have managed to surpass your work from last years Best of Anime and produce another masterpiece - Something that's so enjoyable to watch, I actually watch at 1x speed.  also gave me about 5 anime recommendations for things i missed this season, goddammit my list is getting long
1:16 I could recognize Aki’s laughter in there x’D
Awesome video!!!! Okay now where's the comment that lists all of the anime mentioned? 🥺
Takagi san
Where is jujutsu Kaisen
2022 stands as one of the best years for anime ever (possibly number one). Its crazy how stacked this past year was.
My name is not Liam but I do feel called out.
such high quality videos. you deserve all the success.
You, my sir, have earned a subscriber.
Bleach not being here feels criminal
10:09 effectively, its 3am xd
18:19 I thought Domestic Girlfriend was what got you into romance anime…
At this point, Final Season on Attack on Titan is not the name of the season, but the name of a new phase of the anime like Shippuuden was for Naruto.
i agree
Marin got me into the romance rabbithole
made in abyss is cool and all... but pt. 1 Naruto still better LMAO
min 10:10 its literally 4:40 am  😭
Amazing video! ❤️❤️
Goldbridge fan? small world 😂
THE SOUND IS OUT OF SYNC
BORF
Where is JoJo part 6?
Made in Abyss wasn’t that bad
Alright, which should I watch next. Lycoris Recoil or Call of the Night?
God, I love Mob Psycho
Emotional 😭
I am disappointed you did not sing world cup during the world cup part of this video Gigguk... As a loyal long-time subscriber who is not a certified OG GIgguk hoodster, I am disappointed in you and would have expected better.
I feel like people celebrated ash becoming champion with the same shock/intensity as when the queen died. Wait a minute.... 🤔
Bocchi over Chainsaw Man gang!!!! (do not under any circumstances think I don't like chainsaw man)
not far off its bloody 2am
Boeing 747 carrying Belgium and Germany is so fucking genius. Good shit Garnt, too bad about Kane, brother. :P
What song specifically did Gigguk use for Made In Abyss?
I'll never watch Made in Abyss. I know I don't have the stomach...
I was afraid MiA wasn't showing up, but when that OST came in,   shivers  shivers my friends  (ngl I tattooed the star compass on my shoulder 👍)
Damn this was a roller coaster, sick video dude keep it going, looking for 2023 to beat 2022 such good anime.
fucking hell, i still tear up when i hear the edgerunner song
I hadn't realized how much I repressed the memory of "I really want to stay at your house" until you just played it again. You're right, traumatized.
Just give me the list Garnt!
Just watched Summertime Render due to your review and I have to say, it really was a hidden gem. I thoroughly enjoyed it
2022 went the fuck off
trash
I really need to sit down and watch Mob Pyscho and Made in Abyss.
Bro stop with the Liam. This is weird
Where's Bleach?
Putting made in abyss as number 1 was the right choice 🥲
Gay girls innit
Edgerunners is so good I'm watching it with my dad. Fucking preem, choomba. But fuck you for playing The Song. I didn't want to be crying.
2022 is one of the best year in anime, i mean i have so many favorite series (anime) on this said year
Bocchi the Rock is simply built different. I listen to Kessoku Band daily now. As sick as seeing Fujimoto's work brought to life was, nothing stuck with me this year like Bocchi the Rock has. Honestly, she's just like me, fr fr, only she actually does make improvements to her life.
Having read the manga, the only thing I feel when I see Makima is endless, unbridled rage. I will never forgive that bitch for the things she does... Goddamn blood chainsaw... I miss them...
fact
I KNEW IT! I KNEW AS SOON AS HE SHOWED TWO GIRLS THAT THE GUNDAM TWIST WAS GAY GIRLS!
Goddamn Gigguk specifically described it for me I can't start watching Made in Abyss😂. I know it's good but I can't just watch it yet
Lmao getting called Grant at his own wedding
I’ve never seen Made In Abyss but I fucking cried in the last few minutes of the video. Forget the anime, Garnt is a great storyteller.
¡¡YURI SHALL CONQUER THE EARTH!!  Also: Made in Abyss
This was such a great video. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment and I had goosebumps the whole time. Thank you so much for recounting all of these great moments in these especially hard times :)
Summertime rendering was awesome!!!
Hunter multiplied by Hunter
I was so caught up in the way he talks about these shows that I forgot which place was Bleach again
When I watched Made in Abyss it was about 3 years after it had already come out, I had no idea what I had missed out on. I quickly finished the first season and went to the movie and wanted more. Season 2, did not disappoint.
made in abyss is mid
first time visit to your chanel but bruh i feel your vibe and i'm subscribed 😎😎😎😎
No one us gonna talk about Overlord 4?
Great but felt Kingdom should've been in there somewhere
Bocchi the Rock made me laugh so much 😭😭💕 it was so easy to watch too. Very refreshing
I’m Surprised no eminence in the shadow, plus I would put blue lock and demon slayer higher
oke this vids deserve a like
Eminence in the shadow....
ok im off to watch made in abyss
Made in abyss is emotional damage
Okay, problably I'm going to upset some Gundam fans, but in space you don't hear battle sounds, actually you don't hear at all
17:43 my boi did one piece dirty
Mark goldbridge in a gigguk video lmao, now that's a powerful crossover
Cyberpunk had me thinking we need more anime adaptations of live action movies and shows.  Imagine..... the Matrix as an anime
Don’t you even dare group generic slice of life waifu bait dogshit like dress up darling and bocchi with actually good shit like demon slayer, mob, or csm. These animes take time, effort and dedication to make and actually tell compelling stories that have something of value to say, while animes like my dressup darling is your annual factory-produced garbage expertly designed to perfectly fit the degenerate tastes of depressed and lonely neets to drive merchandise and manga sales.
2022 was the year that anime as a medium strolled up to its audience and just smashed them in the face with a fist full of pure Quality Shonen? Quality Sports? Quality Slice of life? Quality Comedy? Quality Sci-Fi? Quality Drama? Quality Romance? Quality Animation? *ABSOLUTE FUCKING PEAK*
that video was very god damn good and funny
nothing made me more happier seeing bocchi the rock topping the 4th place
Yea ngl, Spy x family wasn't the funniest show. Hardly made me laugh at all but the show is still great and i loved it
ANIME IS SHIT LOL 5YR OLDS WATHCING ANIMATED CARTOONS LOOOL
One of my favorites from this year that doesn’t get enough praise is Tomodachi Game. Incredible first season that people shit on because ONE character is CGI
No 86 :((
My top 3 anime this year is overlord 4, bocchi, mob 3. Come on man, overlord is isekai doesnt mean its not good
Fun Fact: Interspecies Reviewers is now one the Amazon prime channel aniverse. I dont know why, i dont know how and i most surtenly dont know, what i should think about that
Bocchi the Rock...I've never seen such lazy looking animation work so well that it essentially becomes art.  I'm still at episode 5, and it's already the most I 've laughed out of all the comedy anime I've watched.
iam here because of mark goldbridge
Buddy Daddies -  https://youtu.be/Hwg_clR0AN8
Me, watching through the first half of the video: Wow, most of these really are ones I either adored personally or are still on my Ones to Watch.  I guess I'm actually on the same page as Gigguk this year Gigguk in 3 of the last 5 recommendations:  Hey kids, ya like trauma? Me: Nvm, there it is
As someone who both lives in Japan, and does not have a VPN, and speaks Japanese. I must ask, are you fluent in Japanese? Because the only way to watch Summer Time Render(ing) in Japan on Disney+ is in Japanese only. How are you watching anime in Japan? I watch it in the original Japanese because I dont have a choice.
the best 2022 video
Talking about emotional scaring for Cyberpunk, you got me hard by playing the song, and the final two anime hit home that much more. Well played Gigguk, and I whole heartedly agree with your picks
I would love to give Fenna pirate princess an honerable mention. It was beautiful
I'm scarred by that one song in CP: Edgerunners because I'm sick of it.
Made in abyss is the best anime
Forger best family
I did not expect a mark gold bridge reference lol
The best part was when she turned into ash.  You better know what I’m talking about.
Ah yes. I can perfectly relate. I too devolve into a low poly 3d render sometimes.
Birdie wing is unpopular to the point that three episodes don't have subs in my language which is polish and to finish it I must use those with english subs
The anime you mentioned were great, but this video Gigguk, was a masterpiece man, the script, the edit, the music, the memes everything was legendary mate.
need to watch number 1
First time I come across your channel now and it happens to be this video, and as soon as I saw your wedding part you've shared I found myself hitting the Like button. Not be dramatic, but I'm subscribing too because your energy is blissful.
fk i cried again after seeing the #1 on the list
No aot 😔
Damn my number 1 anime of 2022 didn't make it.
W made in abyss
I didnt watch the second season of made in abyss cuz the first season was sad. Is season 2 really that good?
Not the cyberpunk song man. Cmon
CSM at #6 and yet Bleach was nowhere to be found.  I found this tier list to be questionable at most lol
CALL OF THE NIGHT FINALLY GETTING SOME LIGHT! LETS GO!
Next year we seeing an F1 anime and I can't wait for it to take over the scene 😈
*Ainz sama & Komi San has left the chat*
The editing 👌🏻
gay girls innit?
is there an 18+ version of this list? I am 30 and these shows you say are the best of 2022 suck donkey di**
Made in Abyss the best.
what anime is that at 11:00?
Totally Not Me Waiting For Jojo Cuz why not
What no iskekai? Kekw
bocchi the rock was jsut spectacular;. i never laughed so much in my whole life. i love it.
wait untill opm 3 comes
Curse? Thought it was going to be his age curse lol
damn ur ranking videos are so great  u can perfectly provide a showcase of an anime without spoiling it 🙋‍♂🙋‍♂
honorable mention: one piece ;D
I feel attacked at 10:13 of this video (Joke)
Damn when you let "Witch From Mercury" play it gave me chills right away. And then Kevin Penkin's hit me with the same chills but also almost made me cry on cue.  I gotta say, I agree that Made in Abyss is my number 1 of 2022. I don't think any other anime gave me or could ever give me that kind of experience.
8:07 *Akari Watanabe exists* now… ❤
Chainsawman should have been first.
Bro your comedic level is out of this world :D. would love to see if you ever do a standup comedy :D
what was the made in abyss ost he showed?
I am glad the Gundam series is getting recognition, it is underrated in the anime world, even my friends don't know what is Gundam had me worried for days so I am glad witch from mercury nailed the storyline and getting top 7, congrats Gundam witch from mercury:)
Demon girl next door s2 was the only one I cared about so yea
10:20 lol I do it in fucking Brazil
I feel like in the west we fucking love CSM but Japan just doesn't like it for reasons I really don't understand.
Yooo fuck you 😂😂 it's 3am, but that joke almost made me choke on my Vietnams.
-Gigguks makes a list  -i freaking love it
Man...I got called out watching this video at 2:55 AM.
11:12 Holy shit, when you said Re Zero I didn't expect the EEEEEEIIIEEEAAAAAA at the shocking moments.
Also, Messi should have been given a red card for hand ball in the game against Netherlands (?) I think. A guy one the other team had just done it 5 minutes before and got a yellow card. Messi does it and gets a warning....he already had a yellow card and the ref didn't want to throw him out, though he should have
Honestly, demon slayer season 2 WAS mid, if even that......the first half was the movie (what a rip) and the second half was as if they brought Michael Bay in to direct it.....obviously there's supernatural stuff and the humans can do more but idk it seemed ridiculous. ALSO, they basically destroyed a whole town/city. Wtf, made me think of that superman movie. Awesome that yall killed the bad guy but you also destroyed everyone's home and business...........thannnnkkkssss...?
that SAKANAAA went trending
No fucking way the made in abyss ost kicking in got me to tear up ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
Gay girls innit?
Attack on titan season 4 part 2 ?
Good thing I watched the copyrighted video
This anime watcher likes fan service lol
yeah MIA is one hell of experience    and they announce new season before the mangaka even thought about whats next lol
Made in abyss number 1??? HAHAHAHAHAH JAJAJA KJJJ SO FUNNY ! ONE OF THE WORST ANINE IN YEARS! SO FU... BORING AND TEDIOUS ! SEASON 2 is one of the worst anime i see in a while made of abyss is a 2/10 for sure horrendous i see anime like  1000 times from 90 00 10 20 and think is horrendous like myanimelist do a excelent review... i see the movies from made in abyss think the anime is so horrendous bad....
Ahh Lycoris Recoil... my love ❤️ 😍
Spy Multiplied by Family..... I like it
Editing on point ! - as always
"Giant robot fights are awesome" *skips Muv Luv alternative anime*  Gigguk pls man watch it
That Makima edit was just 👌👌👌
I hate that I got called out by name. I'm peeved that you knew exactly what I was doing.
gay girls innit
Gigguk should consider writing Screenplay or Play tbh.
Honestly blue lock was one of my top 5
Go back and watch best anime of 2017. Made In Abyss - we called it. It’s beautiful - a solidified masterpiece.
10:15  I felt so called out I literally went “UUUUUUHHHHHHHHH” Ehhhhhhhhhhh” for like a minute my sole left my body
I thought there was some Bluetooth latency with my headphones but I now realise the audio is just out of sync on the video 😢
man, how did we get so many good anime this year
Bro why is this video fucked up the audio is all fucked up
Is it just me Or when gigguk is talking about a particular anime halfway through we get the visuals for the next anime.? Is this on purpose or a glitch or something??
Oh no! The audio is out of sync by 18 seconds.  Still hype to watch in a few days when fixed.  EDIT: Fixed. Hype resumed.
17. Venus Line 16. 15. Lycoris Recoil 14. Perias Boneka yg jatuh cinta 13. Blue Lock 12. Aoashi 11. Call of The Night 10. Summer Time Rendering 9. Demon Slayer 8. Spy x Family 7. The Witch of Mercur (?) 6. Kaguyasama Love is War 5. Chainsaw Man 4. Rocchi the Rock 3. 2. Mob 100 1. Made in Abyss
I kind of hate made in abyss to be honest. It was just kind of gross. Eh.
This video gets hella desynched at about 11:42
I dont see anyone saying anything about this but around 11:00 there's a really bad audio desync? I've checked it on three browsers and had other people confirm it. What's up with that?
I’ve yet to see Made in Abyss, but hearing that song actually made me tear up. Wow.
I don't know about you guys but exactly at 10:28 the video and audio get messed up as if someone cut a part of the video and left the audio
did they audio get desynced...?
Why is half the video desynced by two minutes?
Damn im feelin the same on Made In Abyss s2 wow he was so right there are some terrifying bits of animation that left me stunned
I watched Bocchi the rock bc of this video Thank you Gigguk What an awesome show with awesome music
Is anyone else getting a audio visual delay around the time of the sleep walking guy?
Types in most popular names and me Noah sitting there at number 2 lmfao and its 1am lollll
Audio de-sync too, does his editor know?
GARNT YOU BETTER FUCKING EXPLAIN 10:56
the audio and the end is messed up
Is it just me or the video and the audio are not synchronized
I caught this live and had to stop when Gig got to #1. See, I was at training when season 2 of Made in Abyss released. I had known it was coming, but hadn't been tracking when. It was that thing I had waited for with great anticipation after the first. I knew it wouldn't feel good. I knew watching it wouldn't make me happy. But just like he said; it's an experience that will haunt you for years. And they just keep dangling the potential for hope at the end of a string.... I feel like I know how it ends. At the very bottom, at the point where there is no deeper level nor a single further foot that can be descended, Riko will find the end of her journey. There will not be a happy ending. Only the memories she brought with her along the way. The friendships developed, bonds forged, and companions who stand around her, knowing that this is the end Riko would have chosen given a thousand chances and the knowledge of the end that awaited her. Trapped, at the bottom of the Abyss, and only death awaits. We will be left to think about all those moments of hope, and love, and the indomitable spirit of one little girl who made the descent knowing it would inevitably lead to her death. That will be our solace. We will not be happy. It will not feel good. I had to stop when he got to #1 because I had to see it for myself. I needed to experience those things. I do not feel good. I do not feel happy. But God damn do I FEEL.  8/8, not the weirdest thing I've masturbated to this year.
At first I thought Gigguk was getting experimental with his transitions but as he gave his conclusion to the video I realized the entire time the audio was out of sync.😂
everyone praising the edits in the comments and I'm here like tf the sound is out of sync???? pls fix the vid.
I was shocked when saw Made in Abyss on the first place! This anime is not that popular as demon slayer or attack on titans. It’s so great that more and more people know about that amazing world and the plot. Omg, I love Made in Abyss!!❤
Video sync borked somwhere.  Starts somewhere in Call of the Night's section for me.  It's in sync at 9:48, when it first switches to Call of the Night, but by the end of that section, it's not in sync anymore, and the next title-card is off.
Is anyone else's sound out of sync?
Gigguk the only man who can make me cry over an anime I haven’t even watched
Around 13:35 The video lags behind the audio for me. DAE? Thinking of saving the latter half of the video until it's fixed.
Oh my God, I never expected to Angry Rant man on anime or Gigguk video !!!???🤯🤯🤯
Blue lock and Ao Asahi. Holy hell Japan at the world cup
I had a feeling it was going to be #1, but when I heard that familiar piano melody, I was relieved and overjoyed
Tifa Kigurumi
Bro my names Liam I fucking fainted when he said my name
Audio got borked from the SxF chapter to the end unfortunately. Is there a mirror?
What an absolutely incredible year for anime! AMAZING VIDEO GIGGUK ❤
What's wrong with editing in this video? Why is it off-beat?
Made in Abyss is probably my favorite anime ever. Such a beautiful work of art.
Just saying, you cant walk on the street at night on LATAM without getting friggin murderred.
the vids desyncedddd :((
Ha! Its 5 am now! Got ya.
you need to fix this vid bro. audio is desynced by like 15 seconds for over half the video
Around the spyXfamily portion the audio and video stop syncing right, at least for me.
Dude wtf can the attack on titan creators milk this ip any more than they are?
is the audio out of sync on this?
It could just be my laptop but the audio and video don't seem to be synced quite right?
Is it just me or someone else's video go out of sync with the audio in the midway somewhere?
I feel ripped off, Tomodachi game did not appear
@Gigguk THE AUDIO IS OUT OF SYNC BROTHA
there's something wrong with the video, no? am i crazy?
Witch of mercury had me like   Gun-Damn
gay girls innit
I was watching this at 3am...
hIS INTRO IS THE BEST OUT THERE. I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
where is AOT
I started watching Ya Boy Kongming. Surprisingly he hasn't burned any armies yet.
Streets in the dead of night in America aren’t really any worse than Europe?
Can anyone please let me know the actual anime titles on the list. Im deaf and there are no close captions. Thank you in advance!
poor tier list
W video
🔹Made in Abyss: the newest season is amazing. I'd recommend watching the movies first as they go over the other seasons really well, with absolutely beautiful animation 🔹Mob Psycho III: This is the final season, but all in all a great trilogy 🔹CyberPunk Edgerunners: Ten times better then the game, watch the English dub 🔹Bocchi the Rock: Cute girls, music, excellent animation. Introverts delight 🔹ChainsawMan: Is amazing 🔹Kaguya-sama Love is War: Best Rom Com, literally 🔹Mobile Suit Gundam, The witch from Mercury: Gundam is cool again!!?? 🔹SpyxFamily: The second best Rom Com 🔹Summer time Rendering: An absolute trip all the way through. Mystery Time-travel Thriller with stunning animation 🔹Call of the Night: Night Owls aesthetic 🔹Aoashi/BlueLock: Traditional Sports anime/ The exact opposite 🔹Dress up Darling: Good, idk I haven't watched it lol, but it looks good 🔹Lycoris Recoil: Anime John Wick, but somehow really good 🔹YaBoy Kong Ming!: Crazy good upstart Idol Anime, there's also traditional ancient Chinese war tactics 🔹Birdie Wing Golf Girls' Story: Golf is cool again!??
Never I would imagine Goldbridge would be inside Gigguk’s video
okey, part 11 hit me hard. But jokes on you, its only 02:42
Not me watching this at 3am 😂
just spy family, nobody in japan pronounces the x, or at least everyone I know
Dude made in abyss is insane, the level of disgust and just pure sadness. I watched a few episodes and stopped, each season is its own level of emotional destruction/rebirth.
Marin IS best girl of 2022.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong.  And that's okay.  Everyone is wrong about things once in a while.  Don't feel bad about it.  Just acknowledge it and move on.
I can't say the list is bad because it was made by our lord and savior Grant, but I am disappointed Ranking of Kings wasn't mentioned
Thanks, as always, perfect
Bleach just completely left off is kinda painful but i guess people wanna keep disrespecting it
akiba maid war was underrated and had a great ending!
so he got demon slayer but not bleach? Classic
I also call it "Spy times Family."
12:22 terrible analogy  It should have been something like "If actions speak louder than words then demon slayer just did the Vault of Death" while showing the vault of death.
The editing of the last 2 minutes the transitions were so crazy I genuinely re watch the last 5 minutes like once a day
come to think of it most of the anime released on 2022 is fire
This was beautiful and what a way to end it... Seriously one of the best not of just the year, but in general. Thank you
Mob psycho is goated and is going on my top 5
Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita is basically every single isekai out there *but you can't tell me sword dad isn't fitting*
For me Chainsaw man was good, but I was disappointed because there wasn't much plot in this first season, and I was disappointed that Denji is just a shitbag. I like more respectable main characters.  Bro. I literally never get chills. But when I heard the Made in Abyss music on that number one. I got chills. I only watched it for the first time a week ago. It's definitely amazing.
This was actually the year I got into anime.
watched this yesterday and now during me watching the new episode of The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady one speciffic sentence kept repeating in my head...... gay girls innit -__-
got ur so wrong csm surpassd the hype
i never noticed just how boring this guy really is
8:59 Testicle.
Where is balich
Long story short, this made my day...
MIA best soundtrack
Also as a long time anime watcher I absolutely agree with most of your rankings. However, for the sake of maybe less experienced viewers I cannot recommend the absolute eyegasm hype fest that is Demon Slayer. Holy shit this most recent arc made my heart rate peak.
top tier content
I said this once …. And I stick to it … in the end of almost every gigguk video, these guy got me some tears in my eyes … god damn it garnt!
and 2023 is going to get even more packed🤤
Holy shit. What I took from this besides Gigguk's amazing ability to condense a years worth of top quality anime into a 30 min video is that his meme magic with football is top tier.
Wth is aot s4 p2
Goddamn I picked a great year to get back into anime
Banger video
Even gundam had gay girls in it 😅
the ride on king its a manga, basically putin reincarnated in another world...  and no its not about strap ons, unfortunatley.
wait.. summer time rendering got an anime?? whattttt
no cap 2022 was fucking great in anime
After all 2022 is a really really great year for anime. Full of genres, great new shows and sequels, I can't even believe it's all in a single year.
Did anybody watch Ranking of Kings?
Absolutely amazing video, keep it up you absolute legend
Anddd totally agree with what u say about made in abyss not a show u will enjoy that much cause of the drama and was too dark for soms of us
I'd appreciate if Made in Abyss didn't have so many children in various states of undress performing bodily functions. It just creeps me out not in a good way. The Roman Polanski way.
Garnt this is easily some of your best if not your best work ever, this video was incredible
Nah u put demon slayer on 9 I don t even want to look wtat u put before but I totally disagree ( just my opinion)
Damn we really had some great stuff on 2022  But a show you dint mention gigguk which I gotta give a special mention to is  "Engage kiss" It's also also kind of a banger with absolute great animation and a kissing scene with budget out of the world 💀so would recommend that one!
That Gordon Ramsey clip was so perfectly cut🤣🤣🤣
Nothing beats the fire that is Gigguk's editing
Summertime rendering is so good but here in the US it’s on Hulu. There’s a lot of good anime on Hulu for some reason?
Chainsaw man and summertime rendering were the best anime for 2022
ur mom
I was hyped about this year as well, but at the end of 2022 I have stumbled upon something which was so far and beyond everything what I have ever encountered that it felt like these are just 7/10 "it's alright" shows... Although, it is unfair comparission, because it is not an anime, but hey that's how I felt. Anyway, thanks for doing god's work Gigguk.
Summertime Rendering Represent
How tf did edgerunners even made it into this video? This anime is just trash. Unconnected events, no main point (except for cyberpsychosis but it failed (HOW A LITTLE KISS COULD CURE THE UNCUREABLE)), failed love interest, stupid time skip and pointless characters with no motivation or emotional connection to viewer (except for "I want to have sex with her")
well done
gigguk is the goat
Slightly salty eminence in shadow didn’t make it but I shan’t doubt your senior judgement
Azumanga Dioh was the naime that got me into Slice of Life and I watched it 5 years after the anime came out. But that was kinda my Magnim opis series that made me want to watch more anime about relaxing and wholesome freindships
Now I'm just scared to watch made in abyss
I never thought I'd see the day where Gigguk uses a Danny Aarons clip in a video about anime, truly a wondeful timeline we live in : ^)
I don't say goodbye to 2022, I say FUCK YOU 2022!
the editing is so good in this one! these are the special videos we get once a year
Definitely not crying about #1
You piece of **** F*** you for that smash bros joke 🤣
I haven't finished the video yet but if Gigguk doesn't talk about DIY I disagree!
that emotion is called depression
Nice
so umm the 86 got me into mech anime
Best yt vid I've seen all month
9:30 so sad you didn't mention Morocco :(
I love season summary from you - as I don't get too much time to watch anime it is appreciated to have a preselection of the best ones.
There are only two kinds of people on this planet. Those who have had an amazing experience and those who don't know sosu
yo do not know the powers of adblockers and websites
made in abyss was so boring i dropped it after 9 episodes.
My personal top 3 was Bocchi, Kaguya and MIA any of those 3 being called AOTY is fine with me
gay girls innit
I cant believe i would ever see Danny Aarons on a Gigguk video Oh ma days
I watched every anime listed on this video except made in abyss and I will keep it like that thank you, bye.
Gigguk , thank you❤️
Yessir my Boy Mob made number 2 lets goooo
8:12 They are the same picture can confirm.
The Made in Abyss Anime, for me is  one of the best ever and a milestone... One of a kind Masterpiece
Its called soccer!! 😉
Seeing made in Abyss on no.1 left me in tears
chainsaw man should have been way up
ну чтож... жду перевод Шизо
biggest call out of my life @ 10:10 ... it's 3:14am
Over a million views, there has to be at least 1 liam watching who just nearly shit his pants
where is bleach tybw??
I literally started watching anime in 2021 and out of a sudden 2022 gave me all those masterpieces  What a time to start anime ❤️
WOW, what a year. so many great anime in one year. what a time to be alive.
Demon slayer is only so popular from the animation. And the animation is great. But the story is so basic, and predictable. And it’s always the same thing. *Tanjiro kills demon* then “Oh my god look! The demon had a sad backstory. So deep” Like I don’t give a fuck about the demon brother and sister. Just cause they had a sad back story doesn’t suddenly justify all the Murder they’ve done😂 How am I suppose to feel bad for people who were blatantly evil. They had no regret til they died. So you can’t tell me they were good people deep down.
bocchi deserved a spot on the podium
the worst takes i ever seen
2:42 am actually
The real winner this year imo were the soundtracks. Between The Witch from Mercury, Kongming, Lycoris Recoil, AOT, Bocchi, Edgerunners, and Made in Abyss... damn, some of them actually give me chills and get me teary. } It's such a joy we get this on a weekly basis.
Imagine Ufotable wasn't the one to animate demon slayer 💀
Whats the song that plays at the intro to number 7
I'm kinda sad one of my favorite animes from this year which is Akiba Maid War isn't here but it's your list and I respect that. But at least you put the other PA Works show here which is Ya boy Kongming so I'm happy. Also what a great year for both PA Works and, especially, Cloverworks.
SpyxFamily got me back into anime again after not watching it for 25 years. I can't give a bigger recommendation than that.
gigguk. where is to your eternitty?
gae girls innit'? GAE GIRLS IT IS!!
24:35 bruuh what's this song?? I've been losing for this since... y'know... 🥹
With exes you definitely had to mention kissxsis
That Makima editing was top tier
I must still watch made in abyss
Thank you for the recommendations. Will binge 3 anime and decide if it will become 4 later.
summer time was my fav
Your awesome Gigguk thanks for the awesome video
Where is To your eternity? Massive gigguk L
No way!!! LETS GO ASH!!!
His point about Bocchi the Rock needs to be hammered onto studios, creators and especially, audiences. Animation should shine as animation. They can do things that movies can't. Animations can learn from movies, but it must make use of the unique characteristics it has that movies can't replicate yet even with CGI. Art shifts, style, layering, interesting cut, strange transition, colour and so on are things that movies just can't do yet.   Video games are also suffering from the same problem. Somehow, animation and video games are "childish" and needs to be more "cinematics" to be taken seriously. That's ridiculous to me and is the equivalent of treating movies as childish because literature is the real grown up form of art. The work should explore and exploit its medium while learning from others. Directors like Shinkai who don't make use of animation as a medium is doing a disservice to everyone.
"I Really Wanna Stay at Your House" has forever scared me as being a song that shocks my depression back to life. Goddammit!
Man, I was skeptical about Chainsaw Man and Edgerunners when they both first came out, but after watching a couple of scenes on YouTube, and seeing the community talk about them so much, I said, "You know what? Screw it, I'll watch one episode and go from there." However, after finishing both bangers within a day, I declared myself an idiot for not pulling the trigger (no pun intended on Cyberpunk's part) on either of these anime sooner. I also did catch up on some underated anime this year like Higehiro and My Senpai is Annoying. Overall, 2022 was an amazing year for anime fans, and I just can't wait for what 2023 brings us.
Dude finally someone talk about gundam the fucking sound design and the music team was insane bro the story is gonna hit hard in the second half next season and the animation is top tier the coolest mech I have seen in a long ass time
Boccher keep on winning
man the writing in that video, coupled with the memes and the sound it's just divine
Good video
I'm ngl, I wasn't sure what you were gonna put at the top, then you played the soundtrack and it all instantly came flooding back. I'm not kidding that emotion hit me all at once, not like it did when I first watched the show, but definitely close
Aw man that ost hit me immediately. I wasnt the biggest fan of the Made in abyss movie. I kinda think a lot of anime movies from a series arent great tbh. The new season was really good though. They take the right amount of time to tell the story and really connect you to the characters all over again. Beautiful animation, dreamlike music, and a great overall show  quick edit: there is a song from made in abyss' new season (played at the end of the video) that i swear is just a mash up of disney songs. Once you hear it you cant unhear it
pure perfection yet again from the god of anime himself
Can we talk about the extra transitions in this video???
The absence of Brazil when world cup is mentioned is sad, we are traumatized here in Brazil with that cup, but worse than being a lost against Croácia is being irrelevant
JoJo Stone ocean just hitted me different
fine... I'll try to watch Made in Abyss again...
made in abyss's old story OST song reminds me alot of the music from, terror in resonance,
Obviously puss in boots last wish
I watched Code Gueas DESPITE the mechas. I still hate those with a passion.
If you liked "Cyberpunk: Edgerunners" and "Arcane" You NEED to watch "Love, Death & Robots".  it's a show of that has 3 small seasons in which none of the episodes relates to another (They don't even use the same style of Animation, sometimes it's even IRL). So you get something like 40 stories in one show and any every one of them is incredible.  So you're probably asking yourself how could you make one episode impactful and I ask myself that too that's why I wrote it. and the answer is that they just fucking did it I don't know how but it's a piece of art, and I hope that is most seasons to come.  It's on Netflix and when it was released it was on the top 10 most viewed shows for a couple weeks but it's really under-the-radar.
26:40 ish it's non-Euclidean with an L just like the L you should take for having such GARBAGE TAST-nah seems aight to me.
Great video Gigguk. Good Job.
I feel called out, except it's five twenty am, instead of three whatever.  10:10
Once again, back at it again with some of the greatest editing on youtube
I started watching made in abyss a month ago, and I can safely say, I haven't watched anything like it ever before
9:13 You have also the corrupt and evil organisations that you have to take out😂
Well, guess time to watch some of these I missed....
Great video, could not agree more
28:41 I think you meant SUBARASHII
Man how does he do that??.. He keeps me captivated for the entire 30min!!
Made in Abyss is the only anime i can say is 10/10, the feelings it gives one just cant completely describe. However its really not an anime i would recommend almost to anyone :D
edgerunners proved that studio trigger always had 1 issue:lack of a good writer
3 should be bleach, fck that game
BLEACH; TYBW was pure fire!!
U are correct made in abyss was legendary
girls in it
Man, as soon as the number 1 displayed on screen i was excited But then the music kicked in making me realize what it was i teared up  Made in Abyss is one of the best shows, love it to bits
God damn it. It’s 3:00am…he’s right😭
If he doesn't like My Hero why he watching?
gay girls innit -grant
That was terrifying
Horimiya just got me into romance anime needed a break from the isekai op stuff. It delivered without even knowing it at the time. Komi can’t communicate and shikimori.
Summer Time Rendering really threw me off, because not only did I think it was in Disney+ jail, it wasn't *actually* in America Disney+ jail, it was in international Disney+ jail. No US release. So it just dropped on Hulu on January 11th 2023. So is it a 2022 anime, or a 2023 anime? Whichever way you swing it, it was an *amazing* anime.
Holy shit, it's on number 1. I was literally sad how made in abyss season 2 was just looked over the whole season mostly. It was such an emotional journey. I'm so in for more of it. It does have some uncomfortable scenes I understand, but at it's heart it's just a story about people.
that part fucking terrified me it’s 3:24 am and i’m laying in bed watching this video on my phone and my middle name is liam
Gigguk is gonna be soooo tired after this year though
Tfw haven't seen any of the top 3. Guess they're going on the list. Will watch in.... 2042
Im glad Made in the abyss made it to number 1.
attack on titan? lol
I wonder how much would Ufotable animators be tortured, if they were to be chained in a chair and forced to watch some low quality animation that others studios try to pass off as 'anime' 😀  Anyway Gigguk. You just made "My top X animes" into a work on art.
Aany Darons 🤣
What a fucking banger video
ياخي ولله محتواك بالانمي عظيم تعجبني طريقة سردك الاجنبي الوحيد الي اشوفه ممتاز ورهيب 🫠🫶
I was so confused about how little Made in Abyss was talked about overall this year, glad to see it mentioned at the top, and it makes sense that while it is absolutely masterful storytelling it's not an easy recommendation coz of the nature of the story. And I'm someone who's usually annoyed at how lazily shows tend to throw in insert music to try and make scenes a little bit richer, but the music in Made in Abyss always hits so hard.  Bocchi is such a treat, but at the same time I think people are overhyping it as "the greatest slice of life ever" (feels like something those new to anime would say), def worth the recognition though.
What's that song at 9:48?
Bocchi the Rock is 🔥🔥🔥
27:30 gave me goosebumps. dude anime is not complete without music, and this is why its my favorite form of media
Damn it turned 3 right as my man said its 3 am watching youtubevideos
Thanks, man for goin' through all these animes and tell us your favs. My gf is not really much a fan of anime, but i feel she will enjoy watching Made in Abyss.
This year felt like 6 top 1 shows fighting for the top spot
8:09 so proud he used my meme out of hundreds that used the same caption
Ля Я обычно смотрю переозвучку его видосов и слышать его настоящий голос для меня это что-то... Непривычное?.
dissapoint with gigguk... he is nothing than twitter anime fans... saying mob psycho better than bocchi the rock... that is stupid and unacceptable.. thanks and unsubscribe gigguk... you deserve to get cancel..
So Hunter x Hunter is actually can be read as Hunter Squared? Dang
g witch is something special
I started watching anime this year after years or peer pressure from my friends. I don't think I could have started at a better time
Fuck it is 3 in the morning while I’m watching this…
what anime is 14? why no titles? :(
You know what. At first I unsubscribed but after thinking bout it, it’s actually a good list and video. Good work there mate.
effing it man edgerunner is just too out of the league. That shit really killed me hard
Edgerunners didn't just make everyone forgive about what happened to the game. It made people remembers how much fun we had despite all the bugs, and people literally flocked back into re-playing the now (mostly) bug-free, mod-enriched, performance-enhanced Cyberpunk 2077, what everyone expected the game to be in the first place.
The Orbital Children should be in there
sound lags behind video like 10 seconds, heloooo?! why noone says anything?
Is it just me or does the audio and visuals not add up in the later half of the video?  Edit: Seems to be fixed :)
neat
Great list. Also one I enjoyed was, Love After World Domination
why is the audio in the video not synced anymore?
The audio is fuck mate
Is the audio out of sync for anyone else? I don't wanna say Gigguk messed something up, but I've refreshed the video and opened on different devices and it always seems out of sync.  For example at 19:37 - 19:45 you have the visuals of "my mind is telling me yes", but for me the audio is at 19:53 - 20:01
Have a gday mate
Man waited that Made in Abyss for so long. It's fucking worth it
Is it me or the audio seems weird
Your video and audio are not in sync
ok nah. no way you knew it was 3 am when i watched this. literally everytime you mention a time in a video its the time at that very moment
I think 10:21 is where the audio de-syncs, he probably had to cut a gag of shooting or something. Or he just uploaded the wrong version of the vid...  Edit: Okay now the audio's back in sync with a cut at 10:29, youtube is just being weird Edit 2:Now its fixed, weird 24 hour bug
weird audio is out of sync for me
Marin claim is accurate. she is the best girl
I thought I was trippin. The sound track was off.
Only the real OGs knows that there was a time when this video had no sync issue, most prob it is edited later to escape the copy right strike from that gundamn
what so ever ,my fav is aot final season final edition final decision final tatakae final simp final rumbling final death of animators part 1
Our good youtuber showed us, even a real invested weed can turn his life from Watamote into Tonikaku Kawaii Have fun in life, man and good luck!
Is it just me or are there major audio video sync issues with this video???
Seems like I will have a great time again, preparing to watch Made in Abyss any wide word before I commit self harm?
Happy to see call of the night on here, super underrated anime, watch it if you haven't
why does the audio feel disconnected with the visuals?
it's 3 am now and I'm watching this...... I feel called out by number 11
gay girls 👑
Its hard to notice but the audio de-sync happens for me right around 10:25 and gets progressively worse as the video goes on, otherwise great video Gigguk!
Watched 12/17 in this list, I'm regretful that I haven't watched them last year😭 bocchi, cyberpunk, made in abyss and the new Gundam man it's such a lose for me
more like made with my piss.
Why is the audio not synchronized with the video?😭
There are some parts of the vídeo that are out of sinc with the áudio.
after gundam sound is way off. great vid though
Is it just me or is the audio out of sync with the video starting from 14:00?
Am I the only one with desinced video and audio?
Anyone else's audio get massively out of sync during number 10?
Hey! It's only 2:32!   I didn't come here to be called out with painful honesty, but at the wrong time!
garnt i think the editing needs to be fixed there's just black on 14:00
Made in abyss S2 is the best
i think the audio de syncs around 10:30 ish, maybe a clip got cut?
Damn way to leave out to your eternity
Made in abyss was one of the only shows that I had nothing to say but amazing.
Omg I was so busy last year that I just realized that made in abyss season 2 has dropped
how does bro watch anime and still have rizz
Mark goldbridge meme in an yearly anime review... Life has been fulfilled
Summertime rendering is behind a ***DISNEY*** PLUS SUBSCRIPTION??? Makes sense
bro the audio is outta sinc
watching at 7am 💪 nice try gigguk
the sound is behind quite a bit after you start talking about the witch of merucury, great video despite that.
is it just me that has it the visiual is behind the audio in 7# ?
audio and video get out of sync at around 13:45
man the way you described the increasing tension and excitement in demon slayer was right on the money
I can't believe you put made in abyss first. cyberpunk and demon slayer left a longer-lasting impression than that movie.
Is it just me or is the sound disjointed with the visuals? Otherwise, amazing vid! :D
Maybe my problem but the audio seems to be behind the film. Still enjoyed it.
I just started this video but it feels like the answer to life, the universe and everything is NOT 42, but... gay girls?
what is up with the audio???
Never expected angry rantman to show up out of nowhere lol 😂
Sir, you missed Bleach TYBW 👀
Is it just me or is the audio not synced with the video?
Watch Buddy Daddies. You’ll love it.
where is classroom of the elite
I was thinking why it sounds like a poem gigguk telling in made in abyss
You're wrong, it's 3.20 AM. HA!
Let’s just call it the product of spy and family
I actually preferred made in the Abyss season one over the second but still enjoyed it a lot still one of the best world building for a show.... Cyberpunk was prob my #1 this year
Is anyone else noticing that the sound is extremely de-synced? Especially around the 19:40 mark, the video is slow by a solid 10-20 seconds.
Song for makina?
as a utaite/vtuber/vocaloid fan, i really find paripi koumei and btr very enjoying
gay girls innit?
i watched made in abyss when it first started coming out, i started watching the recent seasons with my family and only then did i realise how weird and pedoey some of the dialogue/scenes are. Why is there any need for a kid to be talking about 'papa's pole'. Sadly couldn't finish the most recent season as had to google the made in abyss author and found out some pretty disturbing things :/ the world building is amazing its just that I cant look past the author having a kid fetish.
14:06 Gundam Audio still in Spy x Family. Will comeback if its just my browser lol Edit: Its good now
okay is the audio timing messed up in later half or is it just my system going weird ?  edit : ok now it is fixed
Of course the Brit brings the actual world cup into a video about anime.
Did you just say that chainsaw-man ALMOST lived up to the hype? It surpassed it in my opinion. Check out supereyepatchwolf’s video on it, as he does a great job of explaining why it’s so exceptional.
@gigguk Is it just me or the audio gets desynched at the end of #8?
Time to start watching anime again. Great recommendations are back
Witch from Mercury ranked way too high in this list. Garnt is a new Gundam fan though.
what the fuck half of these i forgot was 2022, it felt like 2 years worth of amazing anime💀
Dude Bocchi is my new all time favorite show period
I'm surprised this wasn't reuploaded with fixed timing for the audio. It's like 10-20 seconds ahead of the visuals and super jarring to watch.
SUMMER TIME RENDERING WAS THE BEST SUMMER VIBE SHOW EVER (a little dark BUT THERES SUCH INTERESTING PLOT (with way too many twists))
Is it me or the audio and video are not in sync?
Bruh it isn't just me right? the audio and the video lost sync around the gundum introduction
14:07 gundam a bit early?
Ok but like.... Sauce?
8:16, bruh, ever since the usa & uk tied in the cup, it's called SOCCER
Anyone else got audio not sync since spyxfamily section suddenly play witch from mercury's soundtrack?
How did I ever forget how insane the animation in demon slayer was.
Audio desync around 14:00 ? or am i just insane?
Is it just me or the video and audio is actually out of sync? 14:08, 16:07
Closed after the 5th ad
really sad that heike monogatari isn't here i guess you missed it.
Why is video and audio out of sync? is it just me?
I remember finding Gigguk from when he covered Magus Bride. I've followed ever since. As every video he puts out is a love letter to both the material he talks about, and the very fans that follow them. I appreciate all you do, Gigguk.
is it just me or was the audio out of sync
God I hate made in abyss but I binge that show so hard 😂😂
Can you talk about record of ragnorka. Because I’m confuse with it.
i think something happened on youtubes side and desynced the audio. all the top comments dont mention it but all the newer comments do.  either way if someone want a solution: pause the video. open the video in another tab. rewind about 12 seconds then mute the original and try your best to line up the video.  i found it easier to do when he starts talking about another anime and the ranking number shows up.
Why is the audio out of sync?
The audio is off about 15 seconds for me too. Would recommend two tabs with one video skipped 15 seconds and muted.  It wasn't always an issue; YouTube why? :(
I'm here waiting for Frieren at the funeral.
just making sure, does the audio cut forward for anyone else at 13:15 or is it just me?
After @14:00 it gets serious delayed video and audio.
great video mate but gotta deduct points because around the halfway mark (right around between spy x family and gundam) the audio and the video desync
16:06 has a problem, Is it just me or the sounds are not in sync with the visuals Starting from 16:06 .
How is no one talking about the awful audio desync at 13:17, this video is basically unwatchable in the second half
Man Garnt summed up Made in Abyss so well. It hurts your brain and heart but it will probably always be my favourite anime of all time.
The audio de-synch at the end, holy shit  Otherwise!  Good watch!  Gave me some more suggestions.
It's been years since I watched an anime as impactful as bocchi the rock
it the best work, but i don't know, i think video not match with Voice over
10:29 what was that edit?? Also anyone else know where you can watch Call of the Night with subtitles? It’s on Amazon but subtitles are unavailable.
what happened with the sound?
I think it would be funny if you made a video where you try to explain Warhammer lore like an anime
there was somw good anime
yes
Bro ain’t no way you didn’t even mention one piece
11.41
Boeing carrying Germany and Belgium I'm ded lmfaooooo
Maaaaan what a video, holy sh*t
I pronounce "x" as times. Hunter times hunter.
Is anyone else's audio off? just wanted to check if it me or not.
Assassination classroom got me into other genres different from shounen and call of the night got me into romance, I watched 3 different romances the imediate nights after that
Hmm. Going over the the comments for a few minutes. There doesn't seem to be anyone else that get's this video de-synced with the audio.
I would disagree with Chainsaw Man and Cyberpunk. Both show were way too short for the story they were trying to tell. Therefore, it felt rushed in their execution. Heck, Chainsaw Man's vilains were so weak that I don't know the name of the katana guy nor do I care.
Looks like a chunk of the video's audio was removed at the beginning of the Spy x Family bit sometime today and now the audio is not sync'd with the visuals past that point.  Feel bad for anyone who didn't get to watch it when it was working properly in the first couple hours or so.  EDIT: looks like it's been fixed now! :D
You finding Spy x Family NOT funny makes me want to report your whole YouTube channel no kizzy :(
14:08 audio starts running faster than the video
As someone named Liam who likes wandering around the city at 3 am I feel called out.
It's 3:33am and Im watching this, this man just called me out fr wtf, although my name is not Liam, well done 10:15
MiA was truly magical. I will not stop recommending it to my friends
this outta sync?
Gigguk is the goat but you know how to make his videos more entertaining?……..get girls innit.
ranking of kings dont mind me just putting it here
Good stuff Gigguk have a happy 2023
@14:07 audio is off, kinda funny spy times family is gundam pun now, also chapter timestamps are off and video desync stays for rest of video @Gigguk @MudanTV
What about Overlord 4? That season was good. And the ending deserved at leas a highlight.
What a year of fuckin bangers
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE UNSYNCED AUDIO?!
I believe there is an audio issue with the video. It seems to go out of place from Spy x Family. This is the same for the Gundam and Kagaya sections. Is anyone else experiencing this?
Where the hell is the new Urusei Yatsura? Did anyone even watch it? Easily top 5.
Even with the desynced audio, man what a great video and a great year for anime!
Surprised to not see AoT and Bleach here
Made in abbys deserve best anime of 2022
audio is off this vid
Is the video out of sync for anyone else?
Audio is messed up when transitioning from spyxfamily to gundam. prob some copyrighted music that got automatically cut by youtube
yo there's an audio desync when the footage for Spy Family intro plays for too long
bro the intro was lit
Did the audio just unsync halfway through the video?
Sound is fucked starting at 8
yo the audio is off by a lot
audio around 7 & 8 is fucked up? anyone else like me?
Is the audio lagged on this or is it just me??
29:42 nice speech
Did audio desync with the video at 14:08 during Spy x Family and Gundam Witch????
is it just me or is the audio like 20 seconds off from the visuals?
Is it only me or he made a mistake editing after SpyXFamily? The sound is delayed... Great video as usual!
The video and audio go out of sync at 13:15
Him saying Liam after I just came from a fucking GrandLineReview video . . . what the fuck XDDD
Gotta... fix the editing on this video my man
14:05 Ah yes, the Anya gundam series.
At 14:09 your video does not transition the way it was supposed to and still shows Spy x Family when you're talking about Gundam. The entire video is out of sync from this point on.
Why does the audio sync seem so off from halfway into the video on?
Bleach TYBW should've been up there as well...
Made in Abyss literally the GREATEST anime ever made…
NGL...I've been laughing off and on for a good 20 minutes after that "Himeno Fans" joke...Poor Himeno fans, all they wanted was a bird mom.
God fucking damn it when you pulled that song out for CPE I barely managed to open my eyes enough to see the clip of Keanu Reeves crying into a glass of wine.
Cyberpunk anime was awesome. really was surprised.
No bleach deserved to be on top
Watching this as I’ve got a 5 page essay due in a couple hours that I haven’t started 🗿
BLLLEEEEEEAAAAAACCCCCHHH!
2022 has been incredible. My personal favorites include: Bleach TYBW, Chainsaw man, Kaguya, AOT, Demon Slayer, Also as a fantsy major fan I believe these deserve an honorable mention: MOBUSEKA (aka last student of MAdara Uchiha isekaied),  Skeleton knight, Overlord, Eminence in Shadow(aka isekai batman creates Akatsuki),
"Second person in history to be violently stabbed at the Senate in Rome" LMFAOOOOOOo
What’s the name of the soccer and gundam anime?
The Made in Abyss summary made me cry like a baby, sosu.
Gigguk fucking called me out about 3Am stuff xDDDDDDDD
10:17 ouch that hit alittle close to home, but Lord knows I'm not out too late now adays 🙃
Where’s eminence in the shadow
🎉🎉🎉great! Video! Always !!!!!
Wow, we really did have it good this past year! Thanks for the trip down Memory Lane!
this year was amazing for anime
I’m Liam!!! He said my name!!! Mine!!!
Made in Abyss dragged more tears from my manly soul than any anime has before - and just about any other piece of media, too.
When did the year pass? Tf?
where is Isekai Ojisan. literally best comedy series right now
6:15 is the best part of this whole god damn video thank the Gods for Gigguk!!!
i just got called out.
Made in the abyss is the dark souls of anime
After watching Boochi I can see why ppl love this so much, this is smiling friends, but anime, and more crippling depression.
there is no way demon slayer could be ranked 9
He said gay girls to Bocchi and said wait no. But Kita is literally a gay girl
man idk, I love Edgerunners but I HATE Chainsaw Man with a passion.... Perhaps it's that chainsaw man fans think their anime/manga is like 400% deeper than any other anime/manga. to me everything was obvious from the start and it turned boring cuz I couldn't care less about the edgy oc the protag is... to me? A waste of animation and paper, to others? Their world. Does it matter at the end of the day? Nah, it's gonna be forgotten just like most other animes.
The Eminence in the Shadows It's direct Unapologetic Unabashed Edgelord cringe Chuinbyoū power fantasy And I can't stop loving every second of it and get hooked watching its simpleton plot unfolds.
hly fuck i didnt know they made an adaptation of summer time rendering this was one of my all time favorite manga
great video about a great year in anime.   I always love your breakdowns of these shows.  You manage to capture the power of an entire season's experience in the way you describe them.  Your videos evoke as much emotion as the content you cover.
This man had the massive balls to put Bocchi higher than Chainsaw Man, even though Chainsaw Man its my second favorite anime, you have mi respect
How can a top X video make me emotional?...
Mob Psycho and made in abyss feel like we got 2 one In a million animes in the same decade
So bleach just ain't here at all huh.
Cybermid runners fr 😭
19:44 where is this lady's singing from again?😭
Okay, Gigguk needs to do My Dress Up Darling In _ Minutes with his wife as Marin
I laughed so hard at the Jason born part every one at work looked at me
Gigguk does so amazing describing these anime in the most beautiful way ever. He does them so much justice, and honestly gives me chills with how stunningly and descriptive he is with these anime. I wanna watch all them now ;-;
Lycoris Recoil was one of my favourite surprises this year.
If otaku den had this kind of quality...
" get girls innit " -Gigguk 2023
The first season of Chainsaw man is just a prequel (for me). Most probably, the next 2 seasons would be even more interesting
10:52 what? u have to paid to watch anime? tf are u saying? me who always watch all anime for free didn't have to paid a single penny to watch an anime over and over again~
I gotta say the new gundam show really slapped  (If you know you know)
I loved the intro
After Marin second place Akari from Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman. REEEEEEEE
For the first time I can agree with a rating that Gigguk gives; Made in Abyss 1 and 2 were the best anime of their respective year and one of the best animes ever. No discussion needed.
Ye, as a yurifeg I gotta confirm 2022 was epic and 2023 is up on the right track to be killing it.
Бля, я оказывается посмотрел всё, я его всё жиесь
Made in Abyss gives me the same vibes that the old Studio Ghibli did. It really scratched that nostalgic itch that I didn't even know I had
The last time I seriously watched anime was about ten years ago and I have to say I'm really happy with how amazing the past few years have become. I've got quite a lot of catching up to do but so far it has been banger after banger. It's like I'm a first-time viewer again with all these amazing shows that I get to experience for the first time
Great video Garnt! I agree with a lot of your picks. Cyberpunk was probably my favorite of the year. I also agree with your thoughts on Chainsaw Man. I really loved the cinematic direction they took the show!
Dont watch Made In Abyss Season  2 its fucking disgusting
10:07 me who stays up till 4am watching anime and YouTube 😳
Man, this is Garnt's love letter to 2022. I really wish this man never quits making these but we all know at some point he'll stop. Best to cherish it now
idk why but his explanation of kaguya-sama made me cry bc i love it sm too and it’s right 😭♥️
damn
Did my man just say chainsaw didn’t meet the hype?!!!?? Respectfully disagree. I read the manga immediately following the conclusion of season 1.
When i got to the last one i was thinking huh is there anything even left that was good? And then u dropped it. Made in abbys the show that made me feel the most feels
Made in Abyss (Made in Eternal Suffering) got the appreciation it deserved!
I'm still recovering from MiA ahahahhaithurtshahahaha
i swear no one can convince me to watch an anime like gigguk does
I fucking lost it when Garnt compared Marin to Sydney holy fuck.... Truer words have never been said.
I hadnt watched made in abyss before but i was always putting it off for whatever reason, and i saw season 2 come out this year and said to myself, after all is out i will watch both seasons on a binge... bad idea... its the 2nd time i have had actual tears watching something on tv on my life.
I felt like this video was talking to me. how are you able to make something so special and last for 30 minutes straight? Made in abyss totally deserves it.
Love is War? Troll
Anyone can tell me from which anime is the girl at 8:03 please? And great job Gigguk as always, I've rarely watched any animes in the past decade but watching your videos always makes me wanna watch some again! Keep up the good work!
Demon Slayer was hard to watch at first, but it got so good! Though I do watch it at 2x.
fucking legendary video man
need more of that mark goldbridge
All Liams in shambles right now
10:09 it really is 3am!!😂😂😂
I'm so devastated, I can't find a place to watch Made in Abyss Season 2 because I'm in Australia. Help someone, I need yo watch this season!
soccer is so boring
OKAY GIGGUK RELAX, WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS 3AM IT WAS ACTUALLY FCKING 3AM, ARE YOU WITH THE FBI???
put the name of the anime on the screen.
i almost always watch videos on x2 speed, rarely on x1.25.  that one i watched on Normal speed. and i paused it for too many times.
Thank you, you truly make our anime experiences exceptional.
Me queuing up every show on this list
My wife and I chose to welcome our new tv with Demon Slayer’s last episodes. Cause of course you buy the best tv in the market to WATCH Demon Slayer.
Hey I'll have you know I have a very reasonable sleep schedule so I won't tolerate the Liam slander
did you just say SPY ECKS FAMILY??? YOU HEATHEN!
Mark goldbridge 😂😂 8:27
so glad summer time render got on this list, so good yet almost nobody talked about it because of Disney
Starting the video I wondered where MiA would have been, not gonna lie at the first notes of "Old Stories" I teared up a bit.  Damn you Gigguk, I don't wanna feel this much in my comfy anime rating videos..
God damn Gigguk. The 13:10 (https://youtu.be/xXmXM0qRMbo?t=789) line was fucking good, great script writing and editing.
Gigguk and mark Goldbridge, the crossover I didn't know I needed in my life
Thank you to witch from mercury for creating the Chuchu punch scene.May it’s conscious ending impact last forever
10:15 cout me of gard i as on my phone cheking somthing and i jumpt
Inazuma Eleven is still the best football anime don't @ me
I was disappointed golden kamuy goes relatively unnoticed yet another year, but I forgive everything since MIA finally gets some proper praise.
2022 anime was ass dafuq
jojo's missing but great list
Talk more Gundam to me Garnt
I can't believe it, your writing is so perfect. I said Wow, in tandem, because Made in Abyss 2 was literally one thing only. WOW
Call of the night is truly a gem, its kind of in the same place as summer time rendering but at least Call of the night is on an actual anime platform.
No need to call me out like that giggy...
This was an amazing video and the editing is outstanding in every way. the creativity and skill showcased in this video is nothing more than impressive and we dont deserve it.
24:00 the warning wasnt enough
Garnt, I love that you said the X, not only because it messes with everyone. The X is literally in the title, this is the hill I die on.
Gay girls do indeed make everything better...
You got married? Congratulations!
fucking made in abyss bro get away from me with this shit
Thanks a lot for the last one! Amazing manga and anime
Demon Slayer was special for me. As I've grown up I've gained a tendency to over-analyse shows.  With Demon Slayer though I got to just sit and enjoy, just like when I was a kid.
where my liams at?
Hey Gigguk, congrats on that next step of your life. I wish nothing but happiness to you both, From Spy x Family, Witch From Mercury, Bocchi and TYBW, 2022 really was a feast for anime fans. But one that unjustly flew under the radar and genuinely got to me, was Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost. Given how underrated it is I have given up hope that it will continue, but I beg anyone who needs something to uplift them to check it out.
Saw the preview :(
Nothing beats gigguk 🤗☺️ touching those feels that i have forgotten while watching those different series.. series after series.. gigguk just brings it all back.. how amazed i was while watching those
Your style is incredible man!! + Your memes are also really good 😂😂
"It's 3 AM, what are you doing watching YT videos" Jokes on you, it's 4 AM
I'm not watching Made in Abyss no matter what.
Gee, I sure can’t wait to hear Gigguk talk about my favourite anime of the season, Spy multiplied by Family! 😊😊
Garnt I insist on what I've said, it's ok to admit that you like Marin because she looks like Syd, it actually makes it look less weird lmao
Why are people not talking about gigguk including BLEACH!!!!!
I won't lie, the moment the Made in Abyss Soundtrack hit, I got goosebumps
BTR isn't just anime of the season or year, it'll go down as one of the goats of anime. We don't know the true impact that BTR will have on the anime industry for years to come. It set a new standard. It is the standard.
What show is it at 1:27?
kevin penkin my beloved
No bleach???
gay girls innit
I haven't been able to watch a lot of anime this last year, so this list is the perfect way for me to catch up. Thank you!
"The more popular a show is, the cooler you get for calling it mid"  now THAT is the best anime FACT of 2022, so many people like that LMFAOOOO
Here is your emotional damage comment you have been looking for.
Did gigguk just do a full list of his favorite anime in the year and didn't mention a single isekai? Actually watched an idol anime, cute girl moe slice of life, a golf anime, but no isekai.  That's improvement lol
Jesus crist:☠️ Cristens: fuck what do we do?  Weeb cristens: gikkuk released a new video! Jesus crist: move the fuck out my way
making made in abyss number one was absolutely the correct choice
This episode should obviously have been titled ‘gay girls innit’ Ps. The amount of depression u gonna cause by having made in abyss at no1 is unimaginable
cyberpunk was mid
17 crap 16 might be good 15 idk I think gunsmith cats did this concept better  14 not worth watching it’s kinda trash  13+12 another sports anime might be good  11 probably is good  10 interesting plot idea looks good  9 that’s a good anime  8 first episode was good from what I remember  7 gonna watch giant robots are awesome 6  Seems good never watched been going for a while 5 ultraviolent anime so better than most of these animes  4 I’ll watch this lol komi San is crap though  3 that show is probably overhyped tbh one too many greatest show ever comments  2  Guess it’s good  1 looks interesting
Damnit, Garnt, still no love for Bastard!!: Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy! Why?!
WHERE IS JOJO P6
Made in Abyss deserves more attention. Holy hell what a story.
i was really praying u didnt play cyberpunk song
Summertime Rendering is so underrated & a masterpiece at same time. I hope it gets the attention it deserves.
Made in Abyss, Cyberpunk and Bocchi were the best
Gay girls innit? 😂
I was just casually watching the video , appreciating all the hard work that was put into it, and while wandering which would be the 1# spot for the list , the OST hits... I swear to god i got the chills and teared a bit , it took only a few notes to remind me what an absolute rollercoaster of a masterpiece Made In Abyss was... breathtaking indeed...
10:11 Me watching this at 3am 👁️ 👄 👁️
this is pure entertainment
From what i can see, made in abyss it has similiar vibe to it's world as Shadow of the colossus.
NOOOO NOT THE CYBERPUNK SONG PLEASE NOOO 😭😭😭
bro needs to chill with the intros to these istg
Congrats again on getting married. :)
YES! Lycoris Recoil in your best Anime of the year list was my wish for the new year. Such a cute but also emotional Anime. I loved it so much
6:00 where is it from?
And another list to skip. Anyways. 2022 is no more.
I THOUGHT TOMODACHI GAME WOULD BE THERE😅😅😅😅😅😅
10:56 killed me. That was way too funny.
A little disappointed Akiba Maid War didn't make the list, but these are great picks.
Dam*! Gigguk. How are you and bakashift able to do this? Video after video. Laugh, cry, awed.  Thank you.
In psychology, awe is one of the most difficult emotions to describe. It doesn't have any action associated with it, you can't quite pin down what exactly it feels like, and that's what Made in Abyss describes. The feeling of Awe.
dam bro didn't include 86, it def deserved to be on this list
A banger of a video once again. I do think that your videos are singlehandedly keeping me here, watching the next anime even if i barely have any free time left since I started working.   Thank you for that.
This was the 2014 of this decade.
7:50 A very convincing argument
Fuck dude almost cried like 3 times just watching number 1.... Playing the soundtracks was dirty asf man ;-; such a good anime
If anyone was confused watching this and trying to figure out where Summer Time Rendering was actually streamable, it's Hulu.
Almost started crying again once "i really want to stay at your house" started playing... I thought I was over it
I've been holding off watching made in Abyss season 2, but is time to watch it.  Sub or Dub?
I legit spat out my water at 7:18 lol ya got me
I'm fine with standard anime cringe, comes with the property. But Anya man holy fuck. That shit is painful. Genuinely makes me furious, hopeless feeling that that's the type of stuff that gets rewarded.    It's blatantly manipulative and cheap feeling yet no one cares cause haha funny face. Blow my fucking brains out please
The emotional scar is real, it’s like a broken bone that hurts when ever it gets a little cold
No bleach🙄🤔
I honestly forgot Made in Abyss S2 was 2022, it felt like an old story I heard long ago, one that has cemented itself into my psyche as a true Masterpiece
No one cares about your private life.
At this point I'm just waiting for him to make video and watching anime based on that
gay girls innit bruv?
The fact bleach ain’t even in the top 10 is surprising enough, I’m convinced this community just has a hate boner for the franchise and for no reason, put some respect on Kubo’s name, Bleach definitely top 5 not just because of its massive come back, but because this part 1 of the arc was genuinely a masterpiece
Good video mate! Keep up
I had this playing in the background and gigguk scared the hell out of me by saying my name two times
"gay girls, innit"
Anyone know the sound que for 19:45 ? What's the song from??
I agree with everything that made the list, but there is no universe where garnt didn't put them in an order meant to generate controversy
I'm simple man, I see emotional damage, I like the video
angel devil is the best character
Just saying that k-on music gives a 10 out of 0 to boochi but boochi still is realy good
The moral of the video is : How to make your life better , Get girls in it .
"Nobody thinks about sound design" Nigga, have you even watched Jojo's....?
I really want to stay at your house. That iss all.
What about bleach
call of the night looks ugly af everyone is cross-eyed for no reason what the hell is this

Demons slayer season 2 fights were literally plus ultra
It's fucking, it's called CHAINSAW MAN IT'S CALLED CHAINSAW MAN  WHY WOULD YOU NOT WATCH IT IT'S CALLED CHAINSAW MAN
20:09 Chainsaw man manga readers getting flashbacks 25:35 "One and only one"gave me chills
Even though i might sound a bit corny, i feel truly blessed to have take part in watching and experiencing this year of anime even though I've only watched only 5 of the 16 shows mentioned. Im trying to become an animator in Japan  and the reason is on no less part because of garnt, your videos and reviews just keep inspiring me to Pursue my ambitions and goals to even the level of some of the anime this season. I know ( hope ) that 2023s gonna be just as good or even better than last year. Stay vibin people 🤘
really wish hidive went to hell so i didnt have to buy more fucking platforms
Shoutout to the kaguya dub enjoyers
Incredible video. Good job.
I'm not a night owl, it's 4:30, that's technically morning
I want this man to read my urology
I think in 2022 I only watched World Trigger and Arknights... The joys of working two jobs I still need to watch Ya Boi KongMing, it just sounds like a fucking banger. (Also, its an idol isekai anime technically) Lycoris Recoil seems good, havent thought about watching it but people seem to only say its good, so I might watch it actually Marin just seems overhyped but might be fun Both the soccer anime would be interesting, used to play it back in the day. Still sad Japan didnt vs Australia because that would have been hilarious working at the izakaya Call of the Night sounds good too.. I dont get home until 1am so wandering Tokyo in the night is a mood. Summetime Render sounds... interesting, especially the fact that Disney+ was what had it was.... weird Demon Slayer is decent, but I hate that most the time I look for The Slayers, it shows up now, but damn its great Spy x Family was great, still need to watch S2. It was wholesome Gundam Witch just sounds like a shitfest, and I love it, especially with the ending people kept complaining about on Twitter Still havent watched Kaguya... still dont know if I want to watch it tbh, but it sounds wholesome (Also, The Slayers and FLCL were what brought me in to anime) Chainsaw Man sounds overhyped in general, but I know I should watch it once its over Bocchi seems to have the same problem K-On does... the fans Heard it's good though The Cyberpunk anime seems great, sounds like it did the same with what Arcane did for League but for Cyberpunk Mob Psycho lets fucking go though, its just a great fucking anime Made in Abyss though... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Its perfect .Also, I'd 100% recommend it... because fuck everyone else, they deserve to suffer as I did watching it
19:15 killed me 💀
Wow. That is the best description of Made in Abyss I have ever heard. That indescribable contradiction of emotions, the horror that creeps but doesn't pounce, the darkness that is incredibly warm. I can never find the words to pitch this to friends,  and I'm never sure that I even should.
Banzai!
Although its a shame akiba maid didnt get a mention, im really glad made in abyss got the attention it did. Made in abyss is not just you watch it and move on, its one of kind anime experience that i wish i had the heart to rewatch
Gigguk, this is just a masterpiece, all the effort you have put in will not be unnoticed. Thanks my dude, you deserve all the success you had, true peak anime content right here
19:44 WHERE IS THAT SINGING FROM 😭😭Shazam can't find it, and it sounds amazing
I disagree with 7 gundam g witch suck balls and the main character is just dumb no personality
Marijuana Stocks Moving Up! Buy MedMen Stock!! Buy MMNFF today.....
Are you going to do a Jojo's part 6 video
Made in Abyss season 2 felt almost like a fanfiction to me in some of the most disturbing ways possible. It was very whack. But im still excited for season 3 to see how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.
yep watched all of that, mostly crap except few titles Giggoogeek being over exited about mid shows and sport staff there main narrative is like "You can do it" "try hard, snowflake"
SO sad that AO ASHI got overlooked, its so fucking good
So, No one is gonna talk about bleach not being here huh
Dude how do you find time to watch all of these animes???
i want one piece more movies :D
I couldn't agree with you more. Made in Abyss definitely deserves the first place. There's a sure reason that Made in Abyss is my fav anime of all time. It can capture a feeling that no other anime is able achieve. And the music can just melt your heart when you listen to it later on after knowing the story behind it. Kevin Penkin is a genius composer and one of my biggest inspiration. I literally teared up when the piano part from "Old Stories" started playing in the video.  Also Bocchi is my fav from this year. cause i'm an introvert bedroom guitarist as well. I just ordered the manga yesterday.  Thanks for the amazing content as always Grant~
made in abyss absolutely deserves any award one could give it.
Mob ❤️🗿
Wow wasn't expecting Liam from grand line review to be called out like this
Woof
My main man Gigguk reminding people of WataMote and HitoriBocchi. Can't help but love him.
2022 will always be a special year for me in terms of anime.
2020: BOKSU 2021: BOKSU 2022: BOKSU 2023: BOKSU
Summertime render was one of my favorites this year
God, it's been a while since "jesus christ it's jason bourne" got me, thank you Gigguk xD
I can't explain the joy of watching Yamamoto going all out being animated after all these years. I still get shivers after he turned on the sun.
your video has really improved loved it
2:14  based
Everyone in the comments have said great things all I can add is, I have watched a ton of shows I never would have normally found without your recommendations.  Thank you for making these videos, Garnt.  Thank you so much!
Once Ufotable is done with demon slayer they gotta animate berserk
what about the eminence in shadow????
When I realized that Mob Psycho wasn't number 1, I felt disappointment. I was confused for a brief moment, but with a few seconds with my thoughts, the number 1 felt... Acceptable. Convincing, even. I understand it completely.
Gikkuk is my favorate youtuber by a mile, only one who makes videos that makes me laugh, cry feel hype and awe.
gay girls <3 😍
"Sir, we ...'   "GET GIRLS IN IT"
Blue lock is BS anime Gundam witch is a fake Gundam, lmao ep0 is 10/10 ep 12 is 10/10 but everything in between are BS
This list makes vice's anime list look sane what a fucking dogshit listen unbelievable
i was trying to forget made in abyss to make the waiting for season 3 less painful, but after this video I absolutely have to rewatch it
Ey congrats on the wedding :)
7:06 and that right there is why sinon is best sao girl
Ah yes 2022 the anime year of "gay girls in it"
Nice video!
No bleach = Worthless opinion
Wow you really stoped watching anime..there were plenty of other good ones you didnt mention
its a crime you didn't put bleach in the tumbhnail
Oh. So THAT'S why I didn't get Spy X Family. Fair enough.
When Berserk gets an real adaption with each full seasons? If it does it would be an big impact on the anime community
Where's the megalike button?
If someone would tell me the titles of tracks used in that made in abyss part i would be grateful, especially the last song
no jojo?
Okay, as far as the Bokksu ad is concerned, I have something to say... Japanese food, in general, is terrible. However, their snack game is amazing! Nobody does snacks like Japan!
Birdie Wing  ya boy yang mingl  lycoris recoil  Blue Log - Football  Summer Time Rendering  Mobile Suit Gundam - the witch from mercury  Kaguya san love is war 2  BOCCHI THE ROCK  MOB PSYCHO S3  MADE IN ABYSS
As a smash player you just insulted my entire race of people. But yes
The "Really want to stay at your house" at the end of #3 hurted
Thank you so much for mentioning Blue Lock. It just totally overrun in the Crunchyroll voting. I loved that anime. I haven't seen all of the ones on your list, but of the ones I've seen, I love Blue Lock the most. Mostly because of exactly what you said it was. Birdie Wing was cute and hype and full of fun shots, but Blue Lock literally flipped everything that we thought we knew about sports anime on its head. That's why it has become my new favorite sports anime of all time. I literally just bought the manga for it so that I can start reading it
Just hearing old story  is making cry again.damn it.made in abyss is truly a gem of storytelling
as a 2022 new anime fan, i have never seen a show which was as INSANE and EPIC as bleach, especially the new tybw arc. and it's only just begun!!  other shows like blue lock, mob, spy family, aot, csm, eminence, demon slayer, and cote were also AMAZING
Cid: Ah! I am in the background again ...(transforms) For we all know deep down "I live in the shadows and I hunt the shadows"
Man. If only you watched Kotaro.
How did bleach tybw not make this list?
cyberpunk best anime of the year
Bocchi the rock,Sugar apple fairy tale and DanMachi is so underated
Hear me out, cyberpunks ponpon shit is the best song in existence…
This list is literally better than what the entire anime comm voted
Great list, I saw most of them and wholeheartedly agree, definitely gonna watch those I haven't yet.
Gotta love the Steven He insert!
Thanks for the 2023 recommendation list, mate
Wait where's JoJo 🤔
How is Aooshi better than blue lock? I just don't get it
Mayne season 2 of Fumetsu no anata e Imp deserves to be up there
Made in abyss isn't just an anime, it's a work of art. A masterpiece if you would... A genuinely beatiful, yet haunting story, complex characters and an astonishingly gorgeous OST. No other anime holds a candle to Made in Abyss in 2022 & is my number 1 also.
Kaguya 6???? SxF is 8???  How did it happen?
I don't know why Edgerunners is hyped so much. It is pretty much a regular Trigger anime - great start, even greater middle part, bonkers and stupid second half and a bittersweet ending. Setting kinda carried it a lot, but in the end the show as a total is just good for me. Last few episodes felt very weak.
"Marin still being best girl of 2022" and I say, she got obliterated by Yor in less than a nanosecond
Bocchi the rock beats chainsaw man? W list
Where bleach?
I only got to finally watching Made in Abyss after season 2 was done and it was the best binge watch I have ever had. (I say binge watch, it was the only show I was watching just spread out around games, work and long sessions of watching it) and I'm glad I did because the wait for season 2 may have killed me, now I know season 3 isn't close as they're supposedly near the source material and I'd much rather they wait, but when it does come, that will be a good day
same taste or not grant actually makes everything he says relatable
I knew exactly what was coming at 23:55 and I still wasn't ready for it
btw for ppl who don't know, kong ming is zhugeliang's other name
Requiem for a dream movie is sad
I'm convinced, you're actually a comedic genius
that "1" transition was SMOOTH!
😎😎😎
No attack on titan? I thought this was the best season
BRO DONT CALL ME OUT LIKE THAT
Okay now I want to try watching Made in Abyss
You're probably the only anime youtuber that entertains me for 30 minutes and not hurt my brain (and ears... Man there are some really boring and annoying anime-tubers out there!). This video made me chuckle and feel nostalgic as well (goodbye Mobbu, sob).. Looking forward to your next video, man. Keep up the good work. 👍
We all know he put Mob Psycho 100 in second so he could do that dope transition
wher blech?
My favorite thing about cyberpunk animation was the fact you could tell it was trigger. But they dialed it back and only pushed out their style when it served a purpose and fit the story and what needed to be on screen
the music itself from made in abyss is already really great how much more for the whole show
27:26 gave me chills all over my body for the rest of the vid
Chainsawman has Attack on Titan to thank for it's publishing. Shonen Jump rejected AOT because of how gritty it was. Then when AOT exploded, they decided to lower their strictness... a bit too much maybe.
Gigguk doesn't like cute girls doing cute things? Doubt.
A little surprised To Your Eternity didn't get a spot here.
Wait. How can you look so tall next to other eople but look so... sorry. twinky on your own??
ngl, 24:00 hit hard. (((
lowkey I feel like ranking of Kings should have been on this list but this was still a fire list!
Damn this is lit button 👇
Legit turned 2022 and anime got Rtx turned on
Can anyone list the animes that flash up here 10:41? I have seen none of them, and Gigguk is giving them a backhanded recommendation that I want to take.
Let’s go Made In Abyss is #1!!!
Gigguk: *praising the beauty of one of my favorite shows this season*  Me: MF said Eu-sid-ian
imagine the flaming when he didnt place spy family at number 1
Nah. Edgerunner was amazing for the animation but the whole show is shock drama trash
I teared up a little watching made in abyss scenes in this video. what an absolute masterpiece
I feel like one underrated gem of 2022, and I'm not saying this just because I'm a tokusatsu fan, is Fuuto PI (Kamen Rider W). I don't see big creators talk about it at all.
Bro reallt puts most degenerate shows that came out last year, no way you're hitting 30 and still watching cute anime girls lmfao
10:15 bro that's my brothers name
Where is Isekai uncle 😭
Bruh not Gigguk calling out Liams...IM A LIAM
The religion of the anime community to come together, once a year, and watch gigguk year review video 😂❤
I died at the steven He cameo
to be fair, Chainsaw Man had SO much hype behind it that it was impossible for Mappa to meet.
do you need to watch other Gundam anime to watch a certain Gundam series or are they all standalone? I think Gundam looks insane but I just can't be assed to watch super old anime.
Why ppl like Made in Abyss so much? Why? Why? I know the story's good but man I can't handle this..  cute things get smush and children suffering?.. I can handle Blood C, Alone, Elfen Lied, Berserk etc with ease but this... hell nah..
Made in Abyss's 2nd season was absolutely amazing, I cannot believe it wasn't even an option on Crunchyroll's Anime of the Year award.  The only thing this list is missing is Isekai Oji-san but I can understand it getting missed/forgotten due to all the delays.
Thanks Gigguk
so no Bleach in top 17 animes of 2022? damn.
Good now please review at last re zero season 2. Still hoping for season 3.
Bleach not being in this list is a criminal act
FINALLY some made in abyss recognition. Huge pp energy from garnt here making the correct decision of confirming made in abyss as #1. Made in abyss is unlike any other show I've ever watched and I feel its less of a show and more of an experience. You feel changed after watching made in abyss.
Nice
Never thought I’d see goldbridge in an anime list vid 😂 I’ve finally completed YouTube
Made in Abyss reminds me of a little advise I've seen a few days ago: "Art should disturb the comfortable - and comfort the disturbed."
Man, Gigguk makes talking about anime cooler than it actually is
I didn't enjoy the second season of made in abyss quite as much as the first one, it lost a bit of the wonder of adventuring. *Old stories start playing for the number 1 spot* Yeah that's fair enough, it still is an amazing anime.
But the editing is top tier wtf
i took away my like from this great video coz of that Himeno joke... too far
Okay that dropping the soundtrack during the Gundam segment, made me want to watch it.  I also had no ideia Made In Abyss S2 had come out
There's something sublime about Made in Abyss, which I haven't really experienced in any other anime... or really anything, at least not since I've been an adult. And season two took it to a level only hinted at in season one. Part of it is certainly that it juxtaposes Ghibli-esque beauty, moe-blob characters and moments that are dark or gory. Yes, it has all of that, but the sum is far greater.   It has adventure too, but it also feels more cohesive than many adventures with big worlds, less ad hoc. If One Piece or Hunter x Hunter are Minecraft or No Man's Sky with a world that expands because the show continues - procedurally generated... Made in Abyss feels more like Breath of the Wild - it's a vast world, but it feels purposeful, deliberate. And even then, the world is strange and unsettling - unsettling to your sense of reality and the possible, even as it makes an eerie sense. And like an archaeological dig, each new layer (of the story and the Abyss) re-contextualises what has gone before.   And of course, we can't not mention the Kevin of it all. His work on Made in Abyss is truly an example of the soundtrack elevating the work - and this work didn't need much elevating. The music is just so awesomely evocative. The only other comparable work I can think of in otherworldly power is perhaps Yuki Kajiura's work on Madoka Magica, though I think Mr Penkin has surpassed even that. 'The First Layer' has become as iconic for me as something like the Star Wars fanfare by John Williams.   There were so many great shows this year, but I can't fault Garnt for his number one. Even as I was swept away episode after episode by Kaguya, caught off-guard by Bocchi, or riding the hype train for Chainsaw Man... it never really felt like there was a true challenger to Made in Abyss.
The most impacting one for me was yofukashi no uta i enjoyed every second of it and if it wasent for that anime id have nev r discovered the amazing artists that is creepy nuts
15:55 tell that to anybody who's watched fire force or Jojo's
Watching other people get married makes me sad.
What's the music used at the end of the list?
Talking about golf anime reminds me of Dan Doh. I miss that anime
This is the best best of anime list ever and it's awesome❤️❤️
Spy x family season 2 was a downfall
Made in Abyss well deserved.
Made is abyss is so fucking good it's just not fair for the rest of the shows.
Where is JoJo.....
LMAO imagine it got banned in russia so now you can only watch it with vpn (because of gay girls in it or something????)
I watched Summer Time Render and I didn't have to give disney or anyone any money.  .....YOHOHO!
I'm proud to say that I've watched all but 5 of the anime on this list
The review of made in abyss season 2 made me cry, even though I watched only two episodes (of season 2) and decided I wasn’t ready yet. I know it will tear out my heart but I love it dearly.
missing yama no susume s4
15:46 not trying to nitpick (well i kinda am) but most of the show takes place inside a colony so obviously there would be air pumping through it so everyone could breathe but also sound can travel in space as long as there's a medium for it to travel in, and if the beams were exhausting gas that would justify the sounds that are travelling
As someone named Liam.... The fuck dude
Made in Abyss season 2 is the most beautiful clusterfuck that makes me traumatize for almost a week. truly deserve the number 1 spot
Re: Liam. I am a 35 year old woman living in Europe watching this video during my lunch break XD
I've deadass put off watching Made in Abysse S2 because I'm STILL traumatised from the movie. And this video has both made more interested to watch it but also more terrified.
This list has demon Slayer I'm happy
I fucking hate #3 so much it fucking breaks my heart. Damn you Studio Trigger, damn you CDPR and damn you Keanu for getting me into Night City
Man....I told myself (you don't dare go without giving him big diamond 👍 for that super good video)
Great video
Summertime needs some recognision
No Eminence in the Shadow? imo it's a pretty underrated anime
Himeno fans, LMAO
Broooooo I am so happy that Made in abyss is number 1. I swear to god when Riko gave that little teddy bear back to Maa it was just so random and unexpected I have never shed a tear in anime and I shed a tear in that moment. Totally stunning anime and I am happy to see it at number 1 ❤
1:26 what anime is it? anyone? with sky whale
Props for saying "Ufo Table" right and not pronouncing it "ufotable" like so many others do.
Yes! Made In Abyss getting the recognition it deserves!! That show has always been in my Top 10 for the longest time and still is! One of the few animes to make me shed a tear as a young teen who was so invested in season 1's characters and seeing them again was incredible. I was hoping to see more white whistles but still anoter great season! Our boy Kevin Penkin killing it again with the illegible soundtrack lyrics that's somehow another banger!
Please never dtop doing these  Ur the best bye :)
Don't mind me, I'ma just gonna stand here with my billboard sized Shine Post banner
As kobeni fan its true. Isn't she fantastic, I can't say I'm sadistic but she makes me one. While makima fans well they technically our vice versa. Now you just open my eyes how I can know what personality os people by knowing their waifu in chainsaw man. It really have fulls of characters.
Attack On Titan is the best anime of ALL TIME
No bleach ?
dammn it great editing and scripting
I subscribed for the writing alone! Couldn't stop listening. So well spoken
I was naturally expecting cyberpunk and mob psycho to be the top. 3 is cyberpunk - Yes. 2 is mob psycho - But what could 1 then possibly be? made in abyss - Betrayal.
WHERE IS Akiba Maid War? Ah?
Respect some sneak hits like Lycoris Recoil and Summertime Rendering being on the list, but for Bleach and more particularly Attack on Titan to be outside the Top 17 is one of two things: a showcase of how good we ate in 2022 and absolute slander. Attack on Titan is hated on for being popular, there are hardly any sound arguements as to why it's a bad show. Season 4 Part 2 is absolutely incredible, Two Brothers, Memories of the Future and From You, 2000 Years Ago are some of the best trilogy of episodes in anime; possibly TV as a whole. They alone deserve significant recognition alongside an already stellar season, the show being outside the Top 3 let alone not even in Top 17 is slander for sure. Put some respect on one of the goats of the generation.  Also to add on, your Makima rant was incredible; kudos to you and the editor on that one. Truer words have never been spoken.
Gay girls, init?      -Gigguk
What about Mushoku?
No Dragon Quest?
JoJo's fans love copium
Kaguya-sama wasn't how I got into romance anime. That was Domestic Girlfriend.
honestly made i abyss broke me like no other. i ´dont think i can go on....
No maid wars? Bruh what?
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT'S 3AM FOR ME RIGHT NOW?!?!?!  10:11
I Don't Wanna Watch Made In Abyss!
23:06 I appreciate the editing sync here a lot.
Your meme game is just too strong sir!
Literally I was looking up best anime of 2022 two days ago good looks
Ya Boy Kongming is an anime I forgot about. When it aired, I thought it was cool, but never watched it. Thank you for the reminder.
Fuck you grant (not really) for calling me out at 3am on the dot.
How I knew Gigguk posted: my bleach friend was complaining he didn't put bleach in the top list
I used to really love anime in my younger years, but for some reason or another stopped watching any at all over the last 7 years or so & recently wanted to start making a conscious decision to start watching it again, so thank you for this comprehensive list can’t wait to try to watch either all or most of these in the upcoming weeks/months
Man, I was really wishing I haven’t watched anything on this list but I did plus more
24:03 For fucks sake, why you do this to me?
dude you peaked here, this video is just so perfect the jokes, the music and everything
ONE THING i love about our boy Kong Ming is that it essentially gives us a reason why he just let Waver in FGO use his powers and buggered off i think Made in Abyss is a good representation of what the Fae world is like, its beautiful, its horrific, it will pull you in and turn you into another one of them, another thing you can associate with it is the long held quote from the dwarves "we dug too deep" and in this it realy shows what could be there so far below cause if all these things are down there and by the laws of the world it is deadly to go up... imagine what would happen if someone made a tunnel that allowed easy traversal up and down
Been watching anime since the mid 90’s. Always wondered why so many characters were white in Japanese anime..? I think they catered to the UK… But the evolution of characters has somehow turned POKEMON into an anime… its a cartoon at best…, which is the problem with most “anime” now days… There all cartoons filled with white characters who speak Japanese…. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE….😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🤔
God I love your ranking
Thank you.
I can't believe all these shows were only in 2022, I swear it feels like 5 years worth of good anime shows
3:39am callin me out on my shit while the wifes sleeping.. thanks asshole xD
7:56 I'm going to stop watching Anime
Why wasnt One Piece on here  Like seriously; the animation has been raising the story up so far + the directing of it
You know what this video proved this year is....      That year when gigguk graduated from being Isekai man
Dude its 3:30AM… i feel too called out. Gonna pick this back up in the morning 😅
I'm sorry as a gundam fan imma just say it witch from mercury was fucking trash its just a crappy rom-com with gundams it completely fails to capture what gundam is REALLY about
It's 3:00am. I should go to bed.
Still proud to say power is ma waifu
What you doing you at 3 am watching YouTube video  me at 3 am thinking how he knows
grant
holy shit I did not think a mark goldbridge clip would make a gigg uk vido
Made in Abyss trully managed to encapsulate the feel of the Abyss, even to the viewer that is confortably seeing it from safety. The whole story until now has been repeating this idea that the abyss is not just a place of nightmares, but also dreams. It may be a horrifying place, but only in its darkness can you reveal the brightness it holds. This is the reason why our main characters never give up despite everything, and the reason we still watch hoping for them to succeed, despite knowing full well that their journey is doomed from the start.
Aight. I'm just here to say y'all have been sleeping on Iruma-kun for too long. Objectively speaking, I would rank it as close to Avatar the Last Airbender as anything else I've ever seen. It's a feel good anime but it still has strong ass character growth, wicked animation, and a complex cast of three-dimensional characters that includes both gay and non-binary representation in the most genuine way I've seen in anime that isn't specifically categorized under yuri or yaoi. Even if that's not your cup of tea, it's not even in your face about it like high guardian spice or whatever it was called and all y'all need to check it out because I'd rank it even above Spy x Family and I freaking loved Spy x Family.
Always appreciate it when Gigguk makes these videos, Im always too busy and tired to watch anime. But with Gigguk making these videos, I get to know of all the amazing content I missed when I get time off to watch anime. Much love and excellent editing skills as always, from a brother in the anime community 🦦
Licoris and KongMing so "low" means we really had godlike anime this year
I was NOT expecting Mob considering you didnt say anything about it at all
Gay girls innit. damn gigguk I can't stop laughing
nah spy x family is funny
Gigguk never disappoints bro. I agree with the list 100% 😭😭😭😭🔥🔥
I’m just going to assume JoJo part 6 was released after he finished this script.
2022 the year of gay girls in anime
Ngl, Cyberpunk sucked
I felt that Cyberpunk Edgerunners was an updated akame ga kill. Pretty much the same thing just a different universe, but still a great anime
*Anime fans need to realise how blessed we are to have this man in our corner hyping up the industry. Peak video gigguk👏*
No. Witch from Mercury was not good. The problem is there is no war, if you wana get into mecha it is ok but does not anywhere near present the gundam or mecha side of anime, it is a false visage, the rest of the gundam animes are not the same and it creates a flase expectation
watching at 1 am and my name's luke... close
TYBW ???
Even though it wasn't in this list I have to give a shoutout to World's End Harem for being a fairly fun to watch show that got me through a rough section of 2022 (October-Early November) and it was my first H-Anime (I have since Finished Redo of Healer which I can see why people hate it but reading the School Days Lore kinda made me prepared for anything there because Makoto's Dad somehow outdoes anyone in terms of evil)  As for other shows I enjoyed  Akiba Maid Wars gave me similar pains to watching Madoka  Bocchi The Rock - It was a masterpiece but the whole "guitarhero" thing kept messing with me being a fan of the game called Guitar Hero (And Episode 8 coming out within hours of Clone Hero's 1.0 release)  Delicious Party Precure - First Precure Season and longest single season I have finished and It was certainly a break from the Deconstructions  My Dress Up Darling - A very solid Wholesome Anime and I learned so much about Cosplay to the point where I setup some "Budget" ones (Makoto from School Days and Shinji from NGE since I have the naturally black hair they have)  Spy x Family - Brought back a "Childhood" (Mid-Teens) memory of a show called Burn Notice  Engage Kiss - Was just a Fun Show and the HSL Colors going on with the 2 Females  Do It Yourself - Another very solid Wholesome show (Helped me giving the push to finish Akiba)  Renai Flops - A very random and Fun show in a sense it was giving me Haruhi vibes in a good way  CSM - I know nothing about the Manga but I was watching some Doom Eternal Speedruns when this started and it captured the Doom vibes quite nicely
Bleach should be top 3
Gay girls innit
What’s the Made In Abyss song that was played? I need it!
I'm so glad you made a proper 30 mins video and did justice to the best animes of this year. Your previous seasonal video felt weak and pale in comparison but this one brought me right back in.
i wasn't expecting the cyberpunk song to send me half to tears in a moment, but fuck, it so did. I forgot how much that anime affected me.
what's the song title at 9:48? I think same artist as the animes' op
I can't get over it Gigguk anime review is just too good
Bro when I started watching the video I was sure that made in abyss will be there but when its soundrack started playing I was like booooom lets goooooo. My respect to gigguk  like 100 ---> 100000
2022: the anime Gen of "Gay girls in it!"
Bleach ?
I didn't know that you'd gotten married! Congrats to you and Syd, <3
garnt 💀
Thank you🙂
Each one of these anime list type video Garnt drops is something akin to "Hey, you should watch this. Do it." and now I'm going to go watch Bocchi The Rock
shit, how did he know when im watching this shit, how does he know my name
5:12 what’s the music?
Wait a sec.......I don't think I got to see Bleach here 🗿
Damn the moon scene in cyberpunk gave me ptsd 🥲
dont think ill ever recover from hearing that cyberpunk song
I think I’m the only person that actually enjoys watching golf. Every Saturday and Sunday I always tune into whatever PGA tournament is happening that weekend. When it comes to the majors, I watch all 4 days. Golf deserves more respect    Oh yeah anime is good too I guess
I am not crying ok! after listing to Gigguk talk about Made in abyss
Much props to being so descriptive and animated when recommending Anime, I can tell by watching - the love, dedication and passion that goes into these episode and the appreciation for anime. Much respect to you and keep up the great work. Thanks
Mob Psycho is good example of how to do a full series. It doesn't happen often. But man it was quite a ride and im glad i got to be here for each episode release
this top is really well built (as always) and i think i have never laughed so hard to a commentary about a golf anime.
Summer Time Rendering is on Hulu not Disney+
6:21 Ppprrrfftttt 🤣🤣🤣🤣   I was not ready for him to pop up, but it's just perfect.
I looked up the Tifa Lockhart incident. Holy %#@^ Shit!!!! How come I am only hearing about this now? I'm choking on laughter!!!!!
Garnt in trash taste ep: "I'll create an AI to give me wholesome comments"  Me: No AI is needed to do that here.
I was not ready for Made In Abyss season2.
Okay. For real.  Is it pronounced UFO-Tables or U-fotables?
Lucky that I have Disney, definitely going to get that a watch, I sorely miss the Higurashi vibe anime. Minor disagree on Gundam Mercury though, while I enjoy the series I do find the current season a story without closure. While the little details are great, there are still too little going on atm, they could still f-up everything if the big review is not up to the standard (not that I expect them too, but this is the kind of story I would reserve my judgement after that)
Damn every time I watch a Gigguk video it flys by so fast its that enjoyable, these best anime videos over the past few years hold a place I my heart thank you.
Gay girls innit
made in abyss number 1!!!
that mob psycho logo is more than enough to make my eyes teary
Wandering the streets at night is the greatest thing unless of course you're in America
I was going to complain and argue so hard when I saw ya boy kong ming so low but damn... I forgot how many great shows there were this year that I can't really argue
Ugh the American jokes people act like America is so dangerous just dont live in trashy cities and have some awareness every few seconds.
mushoku tensei? where is it
it blows my mind how a single song connected all of us in the pain it gave us
*Gey Gurls Innit?*
What's this one? 1:27
I wish Lycoris Recoil got some more love
11:59 can someone tell me the name of the theme song
"Terrifies you without scaring you"... excellently put. And the core of why Made in Abyss is so powerful, I think. It resonates with the gentle terrors people experience in their own lives.
See you guys on for 2023 ep
Where is isekai ojisan??????????
BRO THIS IS THE BEST TOP 10 EVER
Whats that ost for made in abyss?
Gigguk truly the S+ tier anituber
Gigguk this was your best work. Your writing, timing, humor were absolutely firing on all cylinders. Masterful!
Birdie wing isn't just a golf anime It's a golf anime painted red and flies 3 times faster
Man Overlord will forever be disrespected
Spongebob will always be better than any anime
its 3:48 am and im watching this....
24:51 "Sell hamon to a stand user" I haven't laughed this hard in a long time, nearly chocked on my lunch sandwich
My friend sent me this video at 10:10 because… I have the most popular name.
9:42 reminds me of the guy screaming THE GAME IS BROKEEN!
I’m just happy that Yofukashi no Uta even made it 🫶
Good list but I think cyberpunk deserved number 1
Aot's one season has been going on for 3 years and has made itself ineligible for Gigguk's videos
Where Aot 🫥
HIROI KIKURI GANG RISE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Watching people going into the unknown without any much information and with propably no way back, uncovering history, dark secrets, new creatures, artifacts and other stuff is amazing.
Where do you watch made in abyss I can’t find it on crunchyroll
It's 3 am and I'm telling you the face I made when you called all of it except my name...
REZE GANG RISE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
*how does grant make every video so emotional Like jesus someone give his man an award*
No Fuuto Pi. Time to unsubscribe. :v
It’s actually 3 am
Has Eminem ever roasted a man so bad he dies? 6:04 Smh of course he has, he killed Hitler! Watch some docudobery and education urself GRANT!
I am personally offended jojo part 6 isn’t on here
“Gay girls innit” I love it
How does Gigguk always make me wanna cry over anime I haven't even watched yet
why am I crying
Sadly too much drama. And this season is full of mystery so Summer Time remains on the back of my list.
Made in abyss is like that one scene from full metal alchemist where the daughter gets mutated with the family dog, except for a whole season.
I'm actually sad that the western entertainment industry is a sinking ship
No bleach…?
Garnt really has a way with words. He makes me want to go back to made in abyss, but I just dont think I can do it. The first season was traumatizing enough for me. I dont need more. No matter how good people say it is, I just dont think it will be for me.
It truly was an amazing year for anime. Maybe one of the best in the last decade !
Did you imply that K!on isnt't the single greatest slice of life anime ever????!!!!
Unless I'm understanding wrong, pretty sure Kita is in fact gay for Ryo  Though I'm likely misunderstanding
I am SO happy about top 2. Some of my favorite shows of all time and he did them justice. I teared up on the Made in Abyss bit all over again ffs.
Honestly soccer is just as boring as Golf.
Wtf is this editing? Either the audio synch is fucked up, or the three people editing this video didn't watch what they worked on. The next anime on the list would start playing before he was done talking about the last anime.
The 8:01 meme and relating it to Syd made me laugh so hard.
>Character named Power >Is the weakest character How do they do it?
Absolutely fantastic video, Gigguk! Your descriptive reviews combined with your relentless humour is sooo fun to watch! Also, that edit at 7:16 was absolutely hilarious!
My name is right under Liam’s
You forgot luffy finally fighting a bloody yonkou
10:15 I was not ready to hear my name be shouted at me in the middle of this.
Unpopular opinion: Mob Psycho is nowhere near good as people say it is.  It is good. It is wholesome. It has some good animation. But # 2? Nah man. Naaaaaah. Stop capping. It's boring. Spy Family is better in both comedy and wholesomeness. Chainsaw Man, Bleach, Cyberpunk were better in action. And there are literally anime on this very list that are better in general. I would put it somewhere around # 10, maybe # 8. You said it yourself Garnt- season 2 was better, and I agree on that. When your finale is lacking, it says something. Even emotionally season 2 had much better moments.  To me EdgeRunners, Spy Family, Kaguya derserve to be on top. Followed by Chainsaw, Blue Lock, YowaPeda etc. Summertime Rendering should be # 2 or # 3 easily. Easily. Yet it was robbed here as well.  Call of the Night is boring as hell too. I watched 3 episodes and dropped it. Pretty visuals, zero substance. Vibes are cool when you have a story to tell, Cyberpunk would have been garbage if it only had "the vibes" of Night City without all the cool characters and juicy action. Also no Love after World Domination or Isekai Uncle? Come on.
BOCCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Such a great video, amazing editing, loved every second <3
Cough gunslinger girls cough cough. Dress up darling was so annoying and cringe, STS was at parts LEGENDARY but most parts normal average, Made in Abyss(2) was something else yes the child birth was sad and disturbing but overall the vibes this anime gave is something yet nostolgic.
Gigguk is a living W
At least ONE anime a year, let’s me enjoy the story without feeling I have to force my brain back into puberty to enjoy it. (Ye sorry as awesome as animation is Anime gets hella shallow at a point) Summertime Render and Made in Abyss are the solid stories of the year for me, really had me invested
When you say best girl 2022 cuz she is like my wife  That is the most based you have ever been and it's honestly absolutely awesome  💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
A Gundam show getting highlighted in this video makes me happy. ^_^
I..had never expected a non-Chinese person to know about the Kongming clip, that was amazing. The video editing is also on another level, mad respect for how gigguk continued to improve through out the years.
"If actions speak louder than words, Demon Slayer Season 2 is screaming."   How does this man spit bars with every sentence in every video
Yeah, UFOtable is cool, but my homies love MAPPA
4:14 to skip the sponsor.
DID SOMEBODY THE DOOR TO ISEKAI? 🐁 🪤
“Gay girls innit?” 😂😂😂😂
Ok but like, where is bleach?
1. Mob Psycho  2. Attack on Titan  3. Tatami Time Machine Blues  4. Chainsaw Man  5. Cyberpunk Edgerunners
It’s actually 3 am wtf 😂😂 10:09 man just destroyed me
Mob does not deserve to be ahead of edgerunners
I think this anime came out in 2022, it's called love flops. At first it seems like a harem, but midway threw the season THINGS CHANGE. Very few Animas make me cry, but this was one of them
appreciate the Metal Gear Solid memes
Bro, Edgerunners was actually mid. It wasn't as great as everyone hyped it up to be. I watched it all in one day and didn't feel anything for it.
Nah man.  Kongming and Marin are the only worthy ones on your list.  Everything else was try hard.
I can't even start to talk about made in abyss without being there for like an hour... I really like doing anime analysis (tho I don't have a yt channel so I just write kind of like scripts for fun) and I could never really finish writing about made in abyss because I always remeber to add more stuff I thought about that makes this anime great. It's one of the best pieces of media ever
made in abyss was such a good show i am conditioned to get teary every time i hear the OP.
https://youtu.be/GvDvMLLL8ZY Redo of healer Full Ep
Man your anime priorities are ass. I haven't watched a single damn one of top 4, and i don't want to either. Anime fans really are just hit and miss.
Me, who have not touched anime in 2 years, watched this video:  *_"Sonnova bitch I'm sold"_*  Starts rewatching anime
dont ever rate again❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
"Get girls in it" or "gay girls innit?"
I think Edge Runners was such an out of left field roller coaster it deserves an extra honorable mention. lol
Yeah, Made in Abyss was fantastic, really holding levels of first season and movie sets. But music was more than that. I really have thought that it is impossible to make something better fitting than music of the first season. But how wrong have I been. So beautiful, so horrifying, so peaceful. It is the best soundtrack collection of all times
I'm just happy Made in the Abyss got some well deserved praise. The story in season 2 was touching to say the least.
Made in abyss hit me so hard because i thought it was a cute show
Uncle Lovecraft's Fun Time Murder Hole.
Ranking of Kings?
4:15 I hate you 😋😂🤣😂 Now I can't unsee it when I hear it. Basically I was hesitating to watch it, You decided me to give it a chance, but damn... that opening after watching your vid... I smile at every episode
the made in abyss movie is the impassable wall of boredom thats keeping me from made in abyss season 2. seriously i've tried twice now to watch it and I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT THE DUDES KID
This is not relevant in any way shape or form but the: "I'll see you guys next time" coincided with a virus scan notification on my end which was kind of neat.
I'm willing to say with confidence that 2022 was the best year for anime, ever. No other year in history tops the sheer quality, variety, creativity, and enjoyablility of 2022's roster. It was a lot of fun.
I thinks its been confirmed that Gigguk has an obsession with Gundames
My backlog is growing ever larger.
Does anyone know how to watch call of the night in the uk
He lied!!!! Summer time rendering isn't on uk disney plus!!!!!!!
Chainsaw man had an amazing start
What is the Made in Abyss song at 27:30? Moved me to tears
Akiba Maid Sensou better make the list
The solution to everything is now just gay girls
If y’all think the anime for made in abyss is great, read the manga. Unlike other manga the pages are dark and gloomy like to depict the true darkness off the abyss. The artwork of the characters is really something else and it goes even more into depth of the lore of the world. One of my favorite series because it truly defines an adventure, horror, thriller anime
Why was the call of the night cut in the video? Copyright? Lmao
acting like bleach isnt #1
I can't wait for makima fans to watch to the end then
What is the song name the he used before number 16
you are my absolute favorite YouTuber Gikkuk, putting on one of your videos literally releases endorphins in my brain and makes me laugh before the video even starts, the editing, the humor, the music, it’s perfect, never change.
Ranking of king ain't make the list??
This video is just perfect.
The reson I watched Shonen anime is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood
Okay- there was another good anime that everyone seems to glance over.  Why, tell me why is Fuuto PI looked down upon?  The first ever Kamen Rider anime, and Chainsaw man is the better series?
Why isn't Bleach:TYBW and Attack On Titan Season 4 Part 2 isn't on the list ?
ITS HER DAMN HAND
Are you *sure* that one of the elements in Bocchi isn't gay girls...?
Them puns are Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
my guy your scripts are too good
Stone ocean ending was sooo good
Made in abyss is one of the few shows where I consistently find myself just sitting in silence to take it all in after an episode . Truly an amazing story
Ah, so this is why it’s called trash taste…
where can i watch the new season of attack on titan PLEASE HELP
Here is to Edgerunners, my personal favorite anime of all time, loved it from start to heartbreaking finish! A great year for anime all around, looking forward to 2023!
enjoy this until gigguk hits you with the No.1 my tears just hits the fan T.T
High card is the best this season
I cannot lie when i say I’ve listened to the soundtrack of bocchi a couple hundred times too many
im sorta glad hi dive showed up, call of the night definitely brought a new style and feel to the anime scape and feels like they were given more creativity amd budget to the point it isnt just effects everywhere but subtle glims and glows making things seem beautiful
Fuuuuuuk why'd you have to play the cyberpunk song I just forgot about it 😩😩😩😩🥹
by the way gigguk the Japanese team had they're uniforms designed by blue lock so they literally had the power of anime within them
Bruh I forgot last part of chainsaw man honestly and im too lazy to go back to it can someone do a tldr?
U know i love watching your videos not only because they’re very wholesome but also because u keep remissomgången me that even tho i'm not the beat person people like u can still manage to not only get the love of your life but also trap her in a marriage.
well, i'd put mob in 1st place, but fair enough
Cyberpunk Edgerunners was so good it made me play the game to finish.
2022 went hard. Loved so much that released, especially some sleepers.
"best of anime 2022" but first show he mentions is "my hero season 6" bruh please 💀
Lycoris Recoil shouldve been way higher
Why no aot 😟
i am begging you all... please give us any other anime YouTubers instead of this guy i hate having to come here to find anime, man makes me cringe every 5 seconds
Kongming uses Vicious Mockery.
16:18 This gave me goosebumps! This piece of the video was a whole ending
by far,  the best youtube video of roller-coaster ride of emotions.
The only thing I didn't like about season 2 of Made In Abyss was that they seem to have dropped the whole concept of season 1 and that was the search for Rico's mom. Hopefully if there's a season 3 they get back to that.
What about Kage  no jitsuryokusha ni natritakute (The Eminence in Shadow) did you not see it or was it not in your top 17?
drinking game mode everytime you hear the word "GIRL"   or sees a girl  DRINK
It's 3 am, and i feel attacked at 10:13
Fantastic video, Grant
I feel like halfway through that dungeon with makima as a final boss would be Angel Devil, just to add a bit of doubletake confusion
Ok 16:25 that's a really good transition
Gigguk is the kind of person that inserts a bunch of memes when talking about a very emotional show and sells you on 20 more
that terror of resonance ost "von"  hits different !
Goldbridge 😂😂😂
this is by far the best youtube video I've watched  while drunk
That top 4 is a big nope.
How can i like this video 10 times ??
RIP DMX
It's Spy X Family idc anyone who calls it Spy Family is a straight goblin
I will always remember bocchi the rock as the anime that comforted me during my worst time in my life while also slapping my in the face and saying "look at yourself"
gay girls innit
man I was sitting looking at my phone while listening to this video and when I was jumpscared to hear my name at 10:14 I mean it.
I'm watching Cyberpunk right now.  And it is not top 3 7 episodes in. The show is rushed, characters are introduced at random, relationships are barely established, the animation isn't actually that good for Trigger (hello Kill La Kill?).  Honestly, it's not even very anime. And the dub is awwwwwwful for a modern production.
Did you only put mob as #2 so you could have that sexy transition to #1?
Liam is sweating rn
Rip Aot didn´t made it
Just don't rate again xd
Kaguya is a comedy-romance anime... Most of the people got into romance cuz toradora or many other examples... This one aint it. Although is a great anime
I’m so glad you left made in abyss s2, it’s been so critically underrated since release. When the soundtrack started I immediately teared up, goddamn. Thank you as always!
bleach???
“Made in Abyss allows you to find beauty in the horrific.” ...this really resonated with me and summed it up perfectly
Thank you gigguk for all these years
"for all it's horror, this is an hauntingly beautiful tale" Man you really manage to capture the experience of watching it well without spoiling. While i got quite confused with the ending and think Cyberpunk is the anime of the year. I have to completely agree with your choice of Made in abyss S2, goddamn that soundtrack just fits so well in the story, it's really like diving in a new unexplored world.
Gigguk: Eminem is Alright but has he ever roasted a dude so hard  he Phacking dies? Eminem: KILLSHOT.
*correction Garnt, Cyberpunk still isn't fixed 😂
Made in Abyss Hurts you in the same way Angel Beats does, it's almost physically painful to watch but at the same time while you're drowning in melancholy emotions it makes you smile. Honestly love both of those shows but they just exhaust you both physically and mentally.
bruh it is literally exactly 3:00 am
>No Bleach absolute plebe list
No bleach is wild
I haven't watched made in abyss 2 yet and the small bit of ost in there literally hit me like a truck. I almost screamed
Dude, love your content, have been for so long, but how're you gonna talk about the best anime of 2022, aka the world cup, without even mentionning Morocco
Big brain move. Why not film the bokksu sponsor read on the day you receive it
Gay girls innit🗿
Unless you're in America, That's a Good damn joke.
❤️
Wait, Code Geass was MECHA?! I always remembered it as some supernatural fighting anime with mind games.
The first guy he mentioned on his patreons 💀
How the fuck do you never miss man these videos are literally too good
no Isekai Ojisan........ :(
The sheer emotions of MiA were so heart crushing. Like I was watching the worst moments of someone's life play out in actuality. It was painful but left an important feeling I want to never forget.
I really need to watch Made in Abyss some day.
what is the song a 9:48 ? I need it in my life!
Your videos are hilarious and i love your edits but by the gods your taste in anime is plebian. At least I know what to steer clear of! especially they «gay girls innit» is a half decent filter for what animes get overly tittilated. but hey at least we got spy x family without someones panties flying.
I had never seen made in abyss before but i decided to watch it because garnt raved about it so much. I started it yesterday and finished the first season in one whole sitting and wow. Honestly, same with mushoku tensei. I watched that cuz of how much garnt liked it, started it a few days ago and finished it in two days cuz wow
00:52 This is the highest moment of our Italian politics after Benito Mussolini /s
i am a makia fan and im not sorry
The future looks bright for the Swordsmith Village Arc, the new Naruto movie will be HYPE, One Punch Man Season 3 is going to be a mixed bag due to studio changes, but nevertheless going to be a new and exciting story, Can’t wait to see the new stories that will unfold in Pokémon without Ash, and Sailor Moon Cosmos will be GREAT. All of my favorite anime this year will be exciting, and 2022 really was a banger. Your list of favorites was great as well, Gigguk
Birdie Wing >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Ousama Ranking
Ousama ranking isnt here. My dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
20:25 season 2 is going to be without a doubt a BLAST!
Summer time rendering actually isn’t on Disney anymore. Apparently ended up on Hulu…even tho they are both owned by Disney.
Damn this video. It made me realize I have so much more anime I have to watch.
I'm gonna complain here: Lycoris Recoil pissed me off by the end of it- the creativity of the action fizzled out and the writing was bad; Chisato has a great personality but she's not the hero she should be- she let's the secret police continue their extrajudicial killings. And the only guy who opposes said secret police is an irredeemable terrorist and indiscriminate killer. No way I'm putting this in a"Best of" list! Spy x Family disappointed as well; even if I had been told this was a sitcom instead of a show with an actual plot ahead of time I'd still be disappointed because Yor (who is 1/3 of the whole premise) was completely wasted as a character. She's actually an assassin? Could've fooled me! I might watch that Gundam show, but man, not looking forward to the yuri stuff. Can we please chill out with the gay shit, it's everywhere these days- Yuri Gundams, Yuri John Wick, Yuri Golf, Yuri Isekai, Bocchi the Yuri, etc. 18:27 Thank you, Gigguk. CSM was overhyped to the moon and back. Sure, great show, but not even better than the new Bleach let alone the pinnacle of 2022 anime. Lot of good anime in 2022, some (like Made in Abyss, Mob Psycho) I still have to watch. Here's to another great year.
castlevania plzzzzzzzzz
mmmh castlevenia im i selling it right🤔
2022, the year of gay girls, innit?
guyz plz help me syke up hype for castlevania
I had a feeling Call of the Night would be on this list, glad to see I was right
plz review castlevenia
dude wat about  castlevenia
4:16 i am so happy i wasn't the only who heard that
13:19 wait a minute i know this from somewhere....
no bleach on here is crazy
Both SPY and FAMILY are important FACTORS in the anime
Made in abyss.. I really didn't need to hear a single word about it to know that this anime is god tier. I've bearly watched any anime these years but that's the one I've been peeking at every once in a while, puffing copium awaiting the next season to come out <3 happy to see it at the top of your list too. Something about this mystery just blows my mind and keeps me nailed to the screen
can't believe he said bocchi wasn't gay... blatent misinfo
Just to say makima is created after fujimoto's ideal wife
Made in Abyss had the best story/world building/drama I've seen in a looong time, the music also plays a big part in the show, it's all so well crafted in every detail, pure genius
Me watching this video, waiting for it to end to watch my favourite trash anime, just to be pulled back into the world of anime by his immensly eloquent descriptions
SUMMER TIME WAS SO GOOD AND SO UNDERRATED
Mother great the hell it's the exact time I'm watching this video on time 3 at night
Wow chainsaw man in 5th what a dog take
Gigguk has transcended "What are you doing step bro" and has now reach a state of calm called "Gay Girls Innit"
Summertime rendering
Avg gicuck moment....mf ain't putting BLEACH here as expected
24:19 me fr everytime i listen to that song
Made in abyss #1 <3 gijjuk
think this guy likes gay girls (init)
I pronounce the Xs in the names as well. I always figured that they were there for a reason.
This is the video i was waiting for! ✨
A good list , probably considering the shit ton of good animes last year
Does anyone know what the audio/music at 28:17 was
K-on! Was amazing because it taught viewer how to love ypur friends and family, how to be friends, how to overcome youself. Bochi teaches you nothing. The only thing main girl doing is crying and overreacting for 15 mins out of 20. And it creates absoulutely naive and unrealistic reality, where people would still wanna be friends with you eventhough you provide nothing to this relationship and the only thing you do is making troubles. Kids will watch it, and believe that,but it aint true
Gikkug: Damn, I have to get the 'best of' video out but it's not quite there yet what do I ... gay girls in it
i like the Boing747 Joke
what is the song used when the chainsaw man clip with "my body is telling me.." and then it plays the woah ho.. what's the song to the woah ho.. part 20:00
holy shit I like how blatantly the opinions differ in animes!
I swear to god Grant if Bleach is in top 3
Reigen would be able to do that heck he could probably sell anything to anyone even if they have no use for it he will still manage it somehow
Bleach not being here is absolute bullshit from you grant
akari from fuufu ijou  best girl of the year hands down.
Bochi rock was a unrealistic, boring and annoying piece of rubbish, that is bad for society. No good music and 0 creativity in portrating music, evethough its a music anime. Main girl is so annoying and so over the top with her shinnenigans it makes you wanna finish her sufferings. 0 depth of the every character aside from the protagonist. Only 1 of the 3 girls in the band has a 2-3 scenes to get her know better, but all of em still flat
"Reigen is so full of bs he can sell hamon to a stand user." That joke got me dying😂
Man he's so good, he's making me cry almost on all the numbers after 8. Amazing video!! Absolutely loved it!
Perfectly summed up MIA Season 2. It's one of the only animes I didn't rate, cause I have no idea what to think about it. My moral compass broke watching this.
nice one fella
Number one def deserves it
coma patient, god that joke will never get old. plus Goldbridge and the world cup in an anime review! love it!
Wait…was bleach thousand year blood war not ranked anywhere for 2022 😬
NON EUCLIDIAN PRONOUNCED NON EUKLIDIAN  NOT NON EUSLIDIAN
To the absolute credit, and power that is Kevin Penkin, the moment that song started, I nearly cried, in the middle of work
his script and the visuals are going hand in hand so hard
Another masterpiece of a year rewind! Thank you very very much for your endless effort!!!
where is bleach sennen kessen-hen?
Waited long for this  But op vid me going to watch everything on the list
LIAMS EVERYWHERE *pikachu Face*
Mob smiling 🥲
W year
Actually watching this at 2AM
Now that you point it out yeah 2022 was the year for the lesbians innit?
made in abyss being number 1 is something needs to talk about more, the show is being overshadowed by chainsaw man, mob and other animes
Spy Times Family.
Интересно, что такого случилось, раз доступ к просмотру закрыт? Всё же было норм
Where is attack on Titan ?
One of the best Gigguk videos of all time, amazing job man.
made in abyss emotion=unconditional love. why? because in spite of the naked girl torture, poop jokes, and literal dick-man, i can't bring myself to take it off its thrown as best story of our era
I don't remember laughing as much in a long time as in the dodgeball episode.  holy shit that was great
Finally someone recognizing made in abyss for the masterpiece it actually is 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
when i saw garnt upload the ranking of every anime, i was waiting for made in abyss so fucking bad lmao
I'm not gonna cap with you chainsaw man let me down just because you can finish the manga so fast and I get it splitting it up to seasons are great for them to give them breaks and let them try new art designs but come on I feel like most people in the comments section know the ending of chainsaw man
Slice of life + Action + Cute girls?  Grisaia No Kajitsu came out a while ago bro
If you could have done one piece it would have been number 1 this year it literally broke the internet and wano might be the best arc yet
I think that chainsaw man deserved to be in place 1 but ok . Good video
This is one of the best years of anime, salute to Gigguk fo making such a high quality video.
Am I trippin I did not see any AOT
the number 1 really deserve the spot , made in abyss is really a gem
2:05 This is why I use a VPN.
happy to see made in abyss even on the list seems that no one is  talking about it
Nothing like a good Gigguk video to remind you why you love watching anime and being part of the anime community.
This was so good! Like, wow!!! 😍😍😍😂😂😂
"And help you appreciate the family you have around you" with a big white dog barking, I don't know if you intended what you've done, but oh God never do that again
Mob Psycho was a great ride!
Some of these takes I can agree with and the video's a fun watch, but I can't find myself in the praise of demon hunter nor the new gundam in any way other than for the visuals. On those levels, they're a blast, but I keep hearing Gundam nerds rant and rave about how the show makes no sense on a Gundam level nor general story level, and with Demon Hunter I just get tired of the constant 'I'm completely spent. I can't go on any longer. I'm about to die--BURST OF ENERGY! My trump card trumps your trump card that trumped my trump card trumping your trump card'. The fights can be a spectacle, but the characters should learn to stay down some times
Made in Abyss is a modern work of art
I didn’t even know what Made in Abyss is about, but with Garnt’s description abilities and the soundtrack on the background, for made me drop some tears without knowing why
So I know you probably get a lot of comments, saying you forgot to add this and that. But why did you leave Kotaro all alone.
What's the song at 19:44 (the wooooaaaah one)?
Bro how the fuck does an anime review video have me crying.  Incredible work as always.
How the fuck does this man describe so many animes without repeating himself?
Spy to the Power of Family
LMAO i almost started crying when i heard the Made in Abyss OST, that anime left me broken inside
Just the first notes of Made in Abyss' music gave me violent chills ...
Mmm 4 am not 3
I cried twice bruh
Everyone named Liam:🤨
I watched most of the anime mentioned here, but MADE IN ABYSS was the most satisfying one . That sound track, it was divine. I like Lycoris Recoil and Bocchi The Rock , but none of them were as satisfying  as MADE IN ABYSS.
my dad who is over 60 years old watched anime for the first time this year. he got hooked on spy x family
Thank you for your passionate reviews:)
I just started Witch From Mercury, and it is absolutely making me want to watch giant robot anime! It has never really been a genre that was on my radar, but it sure is now!
Whats the song on the background of number 1? Please and thank you
What, no raven of the inner palace?
I do in fact live in America lmao
16:27 double bass ftw
17:20 Nah bro i have real friends + I am not a guy who things we can have friends virtually.
I'm upset that you put Gundam at seven but said that you could have picked any of the top six as your favorite. I'm totally biased to mecha, BTW.
also holy fuck Gig, these edits are top tier
I hate how rarely you post video, but I love how good they are after waiting for it so long
When he mentioned 3 am still watching youtube…ni checked the time and yup 3 am.
Amazing segment on Mob Psycho
I'm a firefighter and I was able to not only convince a room of 30-50 year old firemen to watch Cyberpunk, but they ended up enjoying the shit out of it. And for that reason its my anime of the decade.
He only put mob psycho at number 2 to make that smooth transition of ONE
Bocchi not being faithful to the manga has been my biggest disapointment of 2023. Some people might still like it but it's not my Bocchi, not the REAL Bocchi and now they might never get to know her.
shout-out for acknowledging witch from mercurys sound  design and music its what sold me on the show
Meep
I am disappointed that the isekai man didn’t put an isekai in the list, especially the eminence in shadow
i have not gotten around to watching Made in Abyss yet but some of the osts you used in your video... wow... Kevin mate, chill
Gigguk, praising mecha anime?
23:48 i've never expected to hear polish music on this channel.  Wish all best from Poland.
I don’t get the Makima love. I’ve read the manga so maybe that’s why? Power might not flush, but at least she’s fun.   Personally, my favourite from 2022 is More Than Married, Less Than A Couple.
Gay girls innit?
This level of story telling and cohesion is what I am aiming for !  another insane video !
Your body is one thing, but if your mind is telling you that getting with Makima is a good plan then there’s no saving you: she is exceptionally sinister to me 😮
It’s never a truly end of a year without these wrap up videos from the Giggster. Genuinely bro thank you for being in my life and accompanying me through this crazy experience we call living. Cheers to another year full of surprises, laughter, tears, memories and of course a f-ton of animes 😊
how to make an anime better get gay girls in it
Awesome list. But man, Gundam The Witch from Mercury is the one that made me go WTF. I will say no more.
ronny >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> pessi
For anyone who like Kaguya, I recommend School Rumble.
Miss Macross is one of the best future funk songs no cap
Katagawa is top tier
Makima got him
My Gundam Friend who has watched every episode of Gundam every is not super fond of Witch from Mercury. She says;  'it's okay but it is a blatant rip off of Ecole du Ciel and I am sad that no one is really calling them out on it'
What about Bleach Thousand Years Blood War??? It's No.1 in Anime Fall 2022 & No.1 on MyAnimeList.
P**** life
8:04
amma go listen to stya at your house and get back to the rest of this video, gimme a minute
We ain't seen nothing yet!  that is so true! although the first season was great it is nothing compared what there is to come. Trust me anime only friends :D
8:29 killed me 😂😂👆
Gundam in there. LETS GO! I cant recommend witch enough.
good soup
9:20 "Boeing 747 carrying Belgium and Germany" No he didn't 😂😭😭
Oh you missed a spot. Didn't hear a word about To Your Eternity, the one that takes nearly 30 episodes to get a basic grasp of what you're even watching.
Back in 2017 I picked up Made in Abyss because of your initial summer review of it (using the famous sunrise scene). I was happy that you agreed it was the best anime of 2017, and 5 years later I'm ecstatic that season two is your best anime of 2022.
bruh where bleach
How to save a bad premise: "girls innit"
Summertime rendering appreciation😭🫶🏼the manga ending wasn’t my fav but the build up was great
PREACH! Made in Abyss my favorite of all time, and now that it's getting the respect it deserves, I can't wait to see the story continue.
Made in abyss is truly amazing, in a year of such strong titles it stood out so much...now to wait for another 5 years for season 3 </3
Cyberpunk Edgerunners resonated with me in a way that nothing else ever has. As an animator, and a 2D animation fanatic, it fucking blew me away with every single scene. Truly a masterpiece
Plan to watch list grew 3 sizes that day
Garnt can make anything sound interesting. A golf anime?? I’m in. 😆 I watched Ya Boy Kongming because of his recommendation and it was adorable, no regrets. 👍
Still waiting for Shield Hero season 2. Shame its been delayed so long. Any day now. No, I'm not coping- and I wonder when Netflix is getting another Full Metal Alchemist series!
Wonder how 2023 can ever beat 2022
I'd love to watch spy *MULTIPLIED BY* family
The year 2022 was chock full of anime that made me smile, laugh, sad, tear up, awe... truly an awesome year for anime fans, new and existing. Gigguk's video is fantastic. He makes you want to watch all of the mentioned shows and the memes were spot on.
Hi I have a suggestion in description I think you could have wrote the anime names why didn't you do that? Your video is good  but (I think)in your description but the name will make it more info but that just me what you think??????🤔🤔
Gigguk beeeeeen the anime reviewing 🐐 since i was a teen.
I really wonder why people love made in abyss its one of my worst anime expectations
Every fucking time i watch a gigguk vid and see an anime i decided not to watch  its such an annoying feeling when i gotta go add it to my list anyway  Screw you gigguk fueling my addiction!
9:43 This guy from my state West Bengal got so famous. 🤣
"Reigan, a man so full of bullshit he could sell Hamon to a stand user"  I'm broken bra 😂😂😂
Who the fuck is Made In Abyss for? Shit is so...fucked.
For all good series, originals and not, I do strongly believe that Lycoris Recoil deserves more recognition by the wider audience (and I am not saying this due to position 15).   It's a truly perfect series for an anime original 12 episode run. It builds its main cast, delivers several selfcontained episodes that evenetually allow the main plot to arise and the characters to grow.  It also didn't shy away from some good ol' anime violence to actually happen on screen, which actually allows you to consider the possibility that someone from the main cast would really die.   It just... Works flawlessly as a selfcontained anime original, showing that it can be done and it can be high quality visually speaking.   Also, while at a surface level Majima is a wannabe Joker idiot, he has way more depth to his character.  I mean, he is a terrorist and all, but the Lycoris are effectively illegal black-ops child soldiers raised by the governement to fucking murder people, are used as expandable and their existence would be denied to the public.  The Japan of this world is pretty creepy if you think about it.  Addionally, he is also another type of strange character: a man with a strong presence and intense interactions with a girl in a Yuri dynamic. You really don't get to see many of those, even more if he is a true challenge for her and surpasses by far the other girl of the couple when It comes to combat.   I wouldn't go as far as calling it my favourite anime of the year... But yeah, It would rank high. Quite high. More I think about it, more my appreciation for it grows.  Also extreme big fucking disagree about MiA S2, but that's another topic.  I prefer the film by a long shot for several reasons. This season sets up such an interesting setting for the first 5/6 episodes and then, rather than exploring it, it's used for the personal character arc of a new entry to the group. One that the author tried so hard to make me believe she was right but doesn't have the balls to stick with the final conflict, giving the easy way out of "The villagers are actually fine with being murdered".
"Midway up your mum" using that next time my friends call something mid
Man. Garnt knows how to sell an anime without you wanting to watch it. He was just describing his list and I was sold on 4 of the anime on his list
Made in abyss has been my fav anime for over 2 years now, I've rewatched it almost 4 times and season 2, 2 times might be 3 times soon but yeah. Made in abyss is just fucking amazing bro. Made in abyss shows us how cruel yet beautiful the world may be.
My god...  Anime sucks doesn't it
STOM MAKING ME CRY GODDAMITTT
my man you could do this same style content reviewing a bag of chips and i would still goble it up. Nom nom nom thanks for dinner!
2022 was a wild year, not even close to catching up with it all. 2023 has started off sad, tho. And congrats!
Gay girls innit
where tf was bleach!?
Bro why is everyone pretending Bleach didn't happen
7:23 They did my man dirty with that photo. But its ok we'll get there...i hope.
wait, is Mob Psycho's new season the last one ever?
Honorable mentions to ranking of kings and Odd taxi for having some the most compelling writing last year.
"... I need to give Disney my money to watch it." I mean, not necessarily.
does anyone know the soundtrack name on 27:45 ?
The d ck riding on chainsawman go crazy, summertime rendering was way better than csm whole first arc
Ya boy kongming is absolutely amazing
Happy marriage life Gigguk 🎉🎉🎉 ❤️ 🇮🇳
Bleach fans must be fuming right now
16:37 kaguya will always be my favorite because of its depth into all its characters and how satisfying it is to see them do well <3
I stopped following Attack on Tittan anime in the middle of the first part of the final season. I can't believe this series hasn't yet concluded
Why is the best trash anime of 2022,  POP TEAM EPIC 2, not on this list?
Gigguk and Jontron uploading around the same time? What is the downside!?!
Homie actually got an actuall Waifu. Teach us the way Sensei!
there is sound in space
(Spy)(Family) was really great tbh
Personally, Made in Abyss ranks much lower for me. It's a good show, but it's too horny for it's cast of characters. Everytime it pulls a fetish gag, it jars me right out of the show entirely.  It's like how all Disney properties have these quip based anti-jokes painfully clogging up the flow at the expense of the story, pacing, themes, and mood.  I like Made in Abyss, just some things would have been better left on the cutting room floor.
I truly don’t get Bocchi’s hype. Glad it at least didn’t get number 1. MIA ftw
i watched demonslayer where i skipped ahead anytime a character moved their mouth. It was a great watch 10/10
Cheers Gigguk i just got over Edgerunners and you just had to rip the bandaid off and poor bleach in it, thanks man.  Sick videos as always
Eminence in the shadow or To your eternity should replace Birdie wing and Bleach should replace Gundam; Grant snuck those in there to promote them more lmao. But ngl I enjoyed Bocchi and Mob more than CSW s1; I’m a manga reader so I know s2 is gonna be a masterpiece (they’ve barely scratched the surface).  Also Made in the Abyss s2 and Ao Asahi finally getting some recognition yes.
my man can probably make me cry at a piece of cheese he tells things in a way it just brings out emotions that were deep within
mark goldbridge appearing whenever gigguk talks about football is hecking hilarious
Thank you for the video, Garnt. The way you are able to make me feel what you felt when describing an anime is uncanny. I've seen most of the anime on your list for this year, but there were a couple that I missed. And now, hearing you describe them, I know I need to go back and complete every one of them.
Made in abyss 2 viewership and hype was so much lower than my expectation that i can’r believe it the best anime on Gigguk’s mind. But slowly going down the list and not seeing Made in abyss anywhere and im keep getting more and more nervous. Did Gigguk really forgot about Made in abyss or did Made in abyss just won?
SOMEONE PLS TELL ME THE OST I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOT YEARS 20:01
witch from mercury spent a bit too much time in the school setting, but it pulled back the veil little by little to show that it's still a god damn gundam anime (in the good way)
What is that theme song Garnt used in Blue Locks part. I can't recall it but it's completely stuck in my head now!
I thought kageya was spy x family  I mean i thought the 2 were 1
Bocchi sweeps
Are the Disney+ shows even on the US version? I can not for the life of me find them at all
27:25
why’d you have to jumpscare me with my name at 10:15
I seriously really don't understand all the Makima love. She freaking sucks. Everyone else in the show is much better than her.
Made in Abyss was my Favorite with Bleach being Number 2 then Mob Psycho 3
Such a great tribute to 2022 Gigguk! Loved every piece of it and it made me feel so many feelings, such a great job man ❤
This video brought me back into anime
LIAM CHAIN 🫠
tbh I never expected Garnt to review the world cup
Spy X Family is dope because big doggo go boof
This man can convince me to watch anything
call of the night made me way too uncomfortable to watch. and i'm notoriously awake throughout the night. i would have vibed with it if it weren't for the aggressive sexuality of it all
garnt is a masterclass editor
But does it have gay girls in it?
cool
Thanks a Lot Grant I really felt like bawling in the office 😢
One piece
Really like that the chapters are only numbers and not the anime names
So many people missed Summertime Render. Greatet that this list mentioned it.
Dammit man. Made in Abyss. I wasn't prepared to start crying.
Gigguk, you are amazing. It's taken years of watching your videos to fully understand why I loved them so much and I think I figured it out after this one, specifically  at the end with made in abyss and earlier with bocchi the rock. You transcend your feelings, I FELT, what I at least imagine to be the emotions you felt when experiencing these shows. I felt almost exhausted at the end of this video because I found myself carried through such a variety of emotions by your words and I must admit also the music you selected from those shows. I simply want to thank you for the passion you put into your work and I hope you know that it is felt, that your words have worked their way into my heart and has helped me find new emotions that I otherwise would of never been able to describe. Thank you.
Gay girls innit😂
I mean mgk is a "punk roxkstar" now
I want to watch Kaguya-Sama but it still reminds me of my ex cause we started it together and split shortly after, so it's tough to go back to it.
My fav from 2022 have to be the witch from mercury and chainsaw man, some people may not like them a lot but I definitely do🔥💯
when high school dxd is what got you into anime and not these cool bro shows like aot demon slayer or naruto.... fuck
I am searching for the liam in the comment section
10:10 Screw you it's still just 1AM
Aharen San was one of my favorites this year. Already seems to be a hidden gem. It made me laugh nearly as much as Bocchi did
watching this at 3 am and Garnt calls me out for it
why didn't I watch much anime this season... gay girls i'n it?
Akiba Maid War should have made the list. I liked Kongming but If i had to boot one off the list for Maid wars it would be that. Thats my anime of the year for sure. Ive seen most of this list minus Lycoris Recoil and Summertime Rendering.   Is Akiba maid wars objectively the best? no. But its great and incredibly memorable.   The latest season of My Hero Academia probably atleast deserves an honorable mention. Its the best season yet but its still airing in 2023 technically.    And I think they did an amazing job on Chainsaw Man. They more than delivered imo. Manga Readers are just being haters. "its cool to think good anime is mid" or whatever. Chainsaw man was adapted brilliantly.
I am literally crying! My man Gigguk! Why did you have to hit us that hard for the Made in Abyss summary?!
This is the video I didnt know I needed. Thanks Gigguk
Great List
Made in Abyss is something really special. I started tearing up a bit when the piano sequence started. Go Kevin Penkin!
Aight quote to live, "Its not something you go into to enjoy but an unfathomable experience that will haunt you for ever" - Gigguk, 2023.
MADE IN ABYSS YEEEAAAAAA
every recommend shows so far: gay girls in it.
Gigguk doing what only he can do. but no way that lady called you grant at your own wedding lmaoo
This is peak YouTube entertainment idc.
Why is the video not available in Russia?
I think my favorite this year was Summertime Rendering.
Ah Fuck
Bocchi the peak
im so happy to see Abyss at #1. The movie and season 2 had a huge drop in viewership compared to how big season 1 was. More people need to experience it.
Loooool. The angry Chelsea guy made it to a Gigguk video, and an anime video too FFS
I sed bleach was v good
Made in abyss is like a studio gibli film if it had a baby with berserk
6:20 wow surprised to see @stephen he here!!! hope u are friends tho😂
Me how was looking for class room of the elite and eminence and the shadow
The actual best shows of 2022 were Kuroitsu, Fuuto PI, Love after world domination and Sabikui Bisco. Only good entry on your list is Edgerunners the Edgerunners. And your taste truly sucks.
Woah that hit when he said "Code Geass is the mecha show non mecha fans watched" 😂
Cyberpunk Edgerunners prompted me to play the actual game and despite the minor bugs they still haven't fixed yet (looking at you car that's glitched 200 meters underground) it's such a good game that I will never forget for years to come. Edgerunners not only gave us an amazing anime, but it gave a breathtaking game a second chance
Guys I want to watch one of the following Cyber Punk, Made in abyss, Call of the night
For this being my first year getting into anime, it was fantastic! Spy x Family, Blue Lock, AoT, Bocchi, Kaguya, Aoashi and Mob Psycho 100 were all a treat. Here’s to 2023!
i agree with every anime on the list except call of the night , that anime was kinda of boring
Gigguk videos are masterpieces. I hope we get to watch one in theatres one day.
Well EM killed MGK
wheres bleach dislike
I’m sooo proud seeing ya boy kongming on this list such a hidden gem
Oh snap! 69K likes! Perfect!
sry grant couldn't watch the sponser cuz gotta study for exams too soo had to skip it
Bocchi and SpyxFamily are my two favs this year for very different reasons. Loved them both so much.
Bleach got skunked
One mistake here. Hamon is easy to sell to stand user cause hamon is better.
i hate anime i fucking forget all the good shows ive watched and all the names so i cant even rewatch it :(((((((((((
9:41 holy shit angry rantman made a cameo in a gigguk video!
Man... Why spoil pokemon...qqqq
What a shame you canonly give one like yourself. fantastic video.
holy shit dude. i'm still halfway through the video and you managed to make me laugh so much. i love the dedication and respect you give these animes. and the edits, damn.
Everything you said "gay girsl innit?" my me laught beyond believe
I did not expect to see Mark Goldbridge on a video about anime
Toradora was my first romance.
Is it just me, or The Eminence in Shadow not getting the recognition it needs?
Ok is i am the only person why there is no aot here..... 🥲
15:12 Jesus, the bars here actually go crazy..
gay girls innit
TenKen is not trash.  Apart from that Gigguk is just saying facts.
Where are the Isekais? :o
Made in abyss Definitely was superb
17. Birdie Wing 16. Ya boy kongming 15. Lycoris Recoil 14. My Dress Up Darling 13. Aoashi 12. Blue lock 11. Call of the night 10. Summer time rendering 9. Demon Slayer S2 8. Spy X Family 7. The Witch From Mercury 6. Love is War 5. Chainsawman 4. Bocchi the rock 3. Cyberpunk edgerunners 2. Mob Psycho 100 S3 1. Made in Abyss S2  7.
ive got my first bokksu last month thanks to you xD
If you’re the one that decides to put Amelie Poulin in the video you are an absolute GOAT
Listen here Grant, no need to call me out
Made in Abyss getting the top 1 spot is beyond well earned. It is one of, if not the only show, that I consider to be an absolute perfect adaptation of its source material.
It's a good list and a good video, as always. I'd still swap out about half of it though.
Damn this deserves to be on trending holy shit, besides the anime in minutes series his is easily the greatest video garnt has made
Mob Psycho and Chainsaw Man were the absolute goats
Man this recap of all the best 2022 animes was good. Thanks Garnt
The hype for that last fight on this weak ass Demon Slayer arc was killed for me, because they took the 'look how much punishment he can take and still fight on!' to ridiculous levels, there was no way to take it seriously or get it hyped when this much plot armor is layer on top of the protagonist. It was such a disappointing way to finish it, not even the animation did it for me on the last two or so episodes.
puss in boots best anime in 2022 no cyap
Damnit, it didn't even take 5 seconds for tears to start pouring out again when made in abyss appeared on screen
I correctly guess that made in abyss will be gigguk number wan hahaha
i'm watching this on my living room tv instead of my phone or laptop to give it the quality it deserves
This served as enough motivation for me to re-watch all the animes last year and that's how you tell Gigguk's the peak anituber Edit: peak-mid anituber (i'm a shonen fan)
Finally a video that gave Made in Abyss the credit it deserves☺
Shame that he couldn't cover bleach in fear of retaliation via copystrike...its my #2 of the year after made in abyss
...bit gay innit?
Was definitely not ready to be attacked that specifically at 10:14. Fuck's sake, Gigguk.
Anyone help figure the song at exactly 20 minutes with the femal singer that goes wahoooo feel like it's a gundam song?
My new favorite quote from Gigguk on why certain anime are great is “gay girls idinit”
Thank you for watching all the shit so I can go straight to the good stuff.
Dude that joke with the regan selling hamon to stand user's was just hilarious 😂 also congrats on the wedding bro ❤️.
Eminem cant kill, but he roasted a guy so hard he had to change music genre.
ive never seen Made in Abyss but this description made me so sad im convinced that i wont watch it ever (im already depressed enough)
CR7 is the GOAT tho
gay girls init
10:12 never have I ever had a reaction that visceral, to that magnitude, of someone saying my name when I didn’t expect it
Actually, Eminem dissed Everlast so hard his heart gave out and he died. Also Em murdered Ja Rule's career, Benzino's career, MGK changed a whole genre after Em dissed his ass. Nick Cannon went into hiding and apologized numerous times without Em even dissing him directly. So yeah, Eminem slays everyone. He even put Snoop Doggy into his place, and Snoop apologized to Em publicly.
Is the video blocked in Italy for the joke? Or did italy dislike the addition of Italian senator Tifa Lockhart?
Dick move for playing I really want to stay at your house and that Made in Abyss ost,  gave me vietnam flashbacks.
Well as always Gigguk doesn’t miss. Witch from mercury was a stretch on this list but everything especially top 3 were on point and well deserved so.
05:52 Wait, is that Syd?
'gay girls innit'
My three favorite anime (for now) is  A Place Further than the Universe Kongming Bocchi The fourth place was 300 years killing slime, which originally became 3rd place after I heard one of its insert songs. I really have a thing for cute girls and music, and two out of my top three came from 2022
Why the hell AOT didn't make it in this list? There are so many memorable moments, the op and ed is banger. What could go wrong? The witch from mercury didn't deserve to be in this last, it's just another boring mecha anime that will slept later on the shelves of anime fandom. The other anime deserve the spot, it's just that it is another generic mecha anime.
After this video...im goin to begin the made in abyss path.
Gnart bro, Gukguk.... wb Stone Ocean?
*Made in Abyss S2 hands down AotY*
Hey Gigguk! You have no idea how long I've been looking forward to this video. Your anime of the year videos are always the best!! If it's okay with you, I would like to recommend a sports manga to you. I recently finished reading Cross Game, and it's superr good and bittersweet. It's by Mitsuru Adachi, and it's one of the few sports mangas that stays compelling even when there's no sports events currently going on. I think you should check it out! Anyway, keep up the good work, and I'll keep tuning in until the next video!!
where is classroom of elites
Honestly one of the few lists that I agree with. Has anime from a wide range of genres which makes it neat as well
Parapi Koumei for best Opening sequence!
2021 is still stronger though IMO. But 2022 was absolutely stacked as you said.  My AOTY  Kaguya sama love is war: Ultra romantic.  How can anyone not love the finale of the 3rd season? They built it up beautifully and they did it in just 3 seasons. Kaguya and Miyuki are the best couple of 2022. A phenomenal series that I can't get enough of. Can't wait for the movie.
gay girls innit!
Thank you Gigguk for giving us the ultimate 2022 watch list
Eyooow That belgium boeiing remark was unnnnnneeded
Garnt you're missing the fact that Mother's Basement, albeit jokingly called it Spyx Family
Shows like made in Abyss easily top ones like Chainsaw and Demon slayer. Don't get me wrong, both of those were amazing as I loved watching every bit of it. But god I never had to watch through the credits in those. Not because I wanted to. But because after the last scene rolled on I just had to collect my thoughts, think about what I'd just watched. Disect which emotions I felt. That is peak writing, getting your viewers to feel things they haven't felt before. It doesn't nead flashy fight scenes, or amazing character arc. It just needs a good fucking story.
Demon slayer’s fights this year we’re FUCKING GODLIKE
holy shit this is good
what's the whale anime at 1:26?
24:16  To this day that sing still gives me chills
Why did Liam need to be the number one name on his list .-.
I just don't get why Spy x Family got so much hype. Nothing, absolutely nothing about that show was appealing to me.
2022 was a great year,Aot s4 p2,Jojo part 6,Demon Slayer S2,Chainsaw Man
Gigguk i thing you forget the best anime in 2022      you know i meen   (ranking of kings 👑)
Ronaldo always the GOAT
can't wait for made in abyss season 3, it's my favorite story, I absolutely love it
14:57 That's what Gundam IBO is for my friend. I wish more people watched that.
Yeah but MiA 2 didn't have gay girls so how can it be #1? (Disclaimer: I haven't watched S2 so maybe there are gay girls, idk)
What anime is the one with the floating whales shown at 1:27
All I can say is #1 tore me apart. I’m not a easily disturbed person but around episode 7 I had to take a break, but I finished and it was beautiful. Thinking about it again gives me tears.
Garnt, you guys need to do a trash talk episode about gundam, pleeeeeeeas 🙏
Great video and a great homage to the great anime hits of last year. I am just sad everyone ignores Kingdom, yes season 1 was rough to look at, took me 4 times to actually get past the first 2 episodes but it gets a bit better as it goes. And each season keeps getting better and better, raising the bar on the grand depiction of the Warring States Period, mixing hundred thousand men battles with intrigue of the court.
what is the background music at 23:50 its so familiar but I cant place it
personally i just love the fact AOT ain't on the list dog anime without the dog
Broooooo my name is Liam and I feel sooo fucking Called out rn
Made in Abyss season 1 is one of those classics that you beg your friends to watch and they don't.. I had no idea there was a season 2.
“Get girls innit” 😂 the only solution to make a show interesting
MIA deserves the first place.
As a Polish person, I am yet to see Cyberpunk Edgerunners 💀
Gigguk:You may or may not have done the exact same things Bochi had done Me:Yes I sometimes glitch in and out of reality too!
Great list but "Ousama Ranking" should have had a spot in this list.
Man I really want to get into made in abyss but I’m such a pussy cuz I can’t stomach these kind of things at all.
Always watched these end of seasons Gigguk recap for see if i lost something good, this time i watched 11 of this list, but completely missed Summer Time Rendering that seem pretty good. And pretty happy that he try push Gundam Witch from Mercury taht in this monet is criminally unwatched
🔥🔥🔥
if you fight me, I've run
Gigguk is the G.O.A.T. of the aniweb.
Kevin Penkin did an AMAZING job with Made in Abyss 2, my man need the respect he deserves.
Mark Goldbridge 😂😂😂
Shout out Goldbridge the legend
surprisingly accurate adaptation netflix
I'm glad at least one person in the reviewing scene is boosting Made in Abyss up. Season 2 started off with about 4 episodes of having no idea what was going on, then 8 episodes of being on the edge of my seat as the answers starting coming via drip feed. Since it released, I've not listened to any single piece of media even half as much as the entire soundtrack for this season in full. I loved Mob, AoT went balls to the wall, Bocchi is awesome and Marin IS best girl this year. But Made in Abyss just hit so different for me. All I can say is I cannot wait for the third season in like 2028.
It's 9am 9am and I'm crying. Shut up. hahah
MiA on first place is more than deserved
19:31 I'm dead lmfaoooo
6:22 That Steven was unexpected but good :D
Where's bleach?
There is so much cgi in anime now days that I already can see people crying for more hand drawn anime in the near future just like people do for practical effects in movies today.
He did NOT sleep on Sabikui Bisco
he just wanted to talk about the worldcup man leave him  alone
Always look forward to these, this was your best yet
Holy fuck my name is Liam and I'm watching this at 2.08 AM. CALLED OUT
bochi the rock is overrated change my mind
10:45 I’ve never been more called out
Mob finally becomes an anime that got a complete adaptation. Made In abyss took me to places I didn’t know anime could. Giving Aoashi the recognition it deserves. We really got an anime for every genre this year and your review killed itS
The humor, edits, script.. I love your video's so much! they always brighten my day! Thank you! ☺
I honestly tried made in abyss first 6 episodes and it did not catch me at all.  Still agree with other positions in most cases.
i cant get over golf seto kaiba
No bleach's 🤨
bruh where's isekai uncle?
Chainsaw in 9 min
Gigguk's ability to take you on a journey of emotions by music and editing choices alone is absolutely insane. Went from laughing uncontrollably, to being near tears remembering certain events from certain episodes, all crafted by the experience mostly found in the music and scenes chosen.
Never thought i see Mark Goldbridge in a Gigguk video
We should wait for it to say Final season finally! I promise! Hahahaha
I'm going to count opening the show with Birdie Wing as huge win.
This is how I found out there was a season 2 of Made in Abyss, HOW DID I MISS THAT?
Trust me if spy x family didn't i am gonna be very dissapointed
I never knew I needed Mark Goldbridge in an best of anime youtube video until now
I feel like I was crying through the entire last 3 episodes of Mob season 3.
I just started watching made in abyss, but my friend won't watch it because 3/4 of the first episodes included shota/loli gags :/
Maybe I'm getting old but I hate how edgy anime is lol
made in abyss gives me rainworld vibes
Хотел пожаловаться, что нет 86, а потом узнал, что в прошлом году лишь 2 последние серии вышли.
We can now officially begin 2023
BOYYSS, IT'S FINALLY HERE THE GIGGUK YEAR END VIDEO!
bocchi the rock's type of animation to show how she's feeling reminds me of don't hug me i'm scared.
your videos make being an Anime fan even more fun than it already is man, great picks from a superb year of new shows. Bocchi, Summertime Render, and Cyberpunk in the same year feels like it's cheating.
didn't expect made in abyss is no.1, i watch season 1 and just think i should skip, look like it a mistake to skip it.
i can't describe how happy i am that made in abyss in no 1. Thanks man it made my day
Gigguk does make us wait for his new videos but you people have to agree that the wait is totally worth it.
that transition from number 2 to number 1 is SO FUCKING SMOOOTH (yo mama's wont be able to handle)
This was such a great year for anime
Where is my Code geass 19th Century ss4 part 2? 😭
Watched Summertime Rendering on other sites. Didn’t know Disney was holding it hostage
thank you
Gigguk be making his videos so good that it's always made me have my emotions run around and do it's own thing enjoying the fun parts and having chills sent down my spine to the very last bit
i stop made in abyss cause of the author ..
Dude AOT deserve to be on this list tho, as a anime watcher ep 20 of part 2 gave me the chills and fired all my neurons, that twist was mad.
Bro i need someone to make a playlist of all good anime osts this year
man never expected Made in Abyss No. 1😍🥰
you didnt have to do me like that at 10:14
Muzik of made in abbyss hits kinda differently
Grand line reviews sensed a disturbance in the universe.
Chainsaw Man at #5? Fake anime fan detected. /s  Your insight and review of anime is always top tier, and I always look forward to each and every video you release!
Nah, gave up Spy Family and Chainsaw Man pretty early in the series. Not for me. Spy Family's joke got old pretty fast and shounen is REALLY not my fare.
But the main question is does Garnt finally agree that Kaguya is better than Chizuru ?
uh, i really loved your video. but there is one single gripe i have with it and it is that you ditched off bleach. it could've easily been in the top ten in the list. and don't give me the BS of IT'S STILL NOT FINSHED YET. and even in the tier list video it felt like you were reviewing manga instead of the anime. which totally felt INJUSTICE TO THE ANIMES HARD WORK. and don't think i am a 16 year old fanboying over it.
Gay girls make everything 10 times better and this season is a proof of that
My takeaway from this video: 2022 shall be dubbed the year of gay girls innit
The Gundam one is terrible. The plot is bland and the main character is insufferable, to a point I haven't seen one since Asta from Black Clover. I watched till episode 4, but had to drop it. Hopefully, the next mecha anime will be good.
I hate how fitting "gay girls innit" is for some of these.
The “x” is silent, it’s not a discussion, or a debate, it’s actual fact.
Despise me all you want but, this is my opinion, chainsaw is being overhype, yes I read the manga and yes I will say it again.. it was overhype like demon slayer did.  At a latter date overhype anime is which we will remember rather than a good show, until someone else point the other better show, then we will remember about it. and say "you are right, why I did not think about that".   Your honor, I REST MY CASE
Yo where you get that lavender shirt?
8:34 the mark goldbridge clip killed me 😂😂😂😂😂
Dam no one piece, I thought one piece would be up there at least
THE VIBES in call of the night
No Overlord nigga?
28:38 sounds like my mom💀💀💀
Honestly man, Dress up Darling is such a biased pick. That show is barely better than mid. Also the main character is a literal incel.
and how do you mention world cup and miss that morocco did the impossible and got to the semi-finals.
Chainsaw man
No bleach? Did I miss it?
The Birdie Wing intro references the finale of No Nut 2022
21:02 HITORIBOCCHI MENTIONED ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE IVE SEEN ANYONE TALK ABOUT IT
Awww I cried when I see Mob. 💙
Did he just forget AOT?
Love it. It was a blast
Agree with the first place, it gave me those kind of feels wich I never expected to feel while watching the show.
Did I start writing an angry comment when I reach 2nd position, because I wanted it to be the first ? (In my mind I did)  And then 1st appeared, I listened to the music, your voice fading to strange memories of sadness and joy, bringing me again to the brink of tears, and beyond.  What a 2022 year we got !
25:58 That theme music of the golden city of the scorching sun is just leaves such a deep imprint. It's....beyond comprehension sometimes.
Love your videos, thanks how all the amazing work🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never imagined a year that he puts Demon Slayer in number 9 and I don't feel the power in myself to disagree
that johnny sliverhand clip was out of pocket gig XD
Can a kind soul tell me the name of the Made in Abyss song at the end of the video?
Man I absolutely loved Birdie Wing. Long live the Penis Life!
Best anime - Gay girls innit
LETS GO #1 LUNCH BOX BABIES!!
That intro to #1 was soul crushing right off the bat. You managed to fully encapsulate this season of Made in Abyss . Likening it to Requiem for a Dream is exceptional.  It's a classic in the best most masterful way.
24:11 IT STILL HURTS.
Yoo where's eminence in shadow 👀
It seems Gigguk accidentally cut out the part where Akiba Maid War was #1
When you think you're finally over the emotional damage and scars that were left by an anime and then you hear the song @ 24:15
You can pay Disney plus in fucking Japan to watch summertime. I pay it and still cannot see it in the U.S
"He could sell hamon to a stand user" got me 😂
Made in Abyss part made me emotional, Garnt managed to describe all the emotions MiA puts the viewer through. I don’t know how but Garnt yet again made me cry while talking about the anime (the other time was I Want to Eat Your Pancreas video). MiA absolutely deserves top 1, masterpiece through and through
Wait,where is Bleach go😂😂
it 's no wonder that MADE IN ABYSS is in the top place ^^
I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or what but I haven't been enjoying watching anime lately.   Feels like lately good story telling is being replaced by fetishes. There are occasionally few gems but the rate of series which I enjoy has dropped by quite a bit.
when you put MIA at no.1, I screamed so loud. MIA is so underrated. I fucking loved that story.
You have me convinced
20:50 actually that's also a thing in there lol
Gigguk, my favourite football youtuber
As much as I respect the opinion, after Made in Abyss turned too edgy and too f'ed up I can kinda didn't want to continue and leave S1's legacy as it was in my mind (especially after learning author's main when he first started the manga)
Made in Abyss may be phenomenal, but I can't forgive the Mangaka for being so pedophilic in the physical volumes, which are bascially accesible for children to buy.  Questioning the intention behind the sexual depictions of children combined with his questionable statements during interviews, it has utterly ruined the franchise for me.
Top 10 reasons to invent a time mashine: 1) Best of Anime 2023
She really Cooked with breast milk?😳
Ngl it will be hard AF to match the quality of anime in 2022.  It was PACKED with gold.
Denji the rock Vs  Anya the slayer
Nahh that was personal
Peak.
Gigguk is incredible. No really
"Marin is still the best girl of 2022"  Yor : Am i a joke to you?
Didn't like Mob Season 3's position in the list. The season was stupid, even as an epilogue
made in the abyss literally is too good.
Paripi Komei deserved to be higher, that show absolutley fucking slapped
Surprised I didn't see JoJo on here. It's a final section that's a send off for the JoJo family. I guess Netflix really did kill it off
the bocchi segment is so good LMAOOO "it's the gay girls, aint it?" no, but also yes. sort of.
good list but isekai ojisan should have been in it, and at number 1
BOCCHI BABYYYYY
sad there is no romantic killer but the best of is still good
Did you know that SpyXFamily saved the Japan birth rate crisis?  It’s on YouTube, search it XD
Demon Slayer was a bloody stream
Damn !  Damn ! I feel sad that I don't have the ability to talk to my friends about anime like you did in the video. Your videos of best of the year is one of my favourite animes I look forward to every year.
Made me tear up 3 times just by talking about anime, Gigguk truly is a blessing
Spy X Family is one of my favorites.
Love you.
I haven't seen made in abyss, I don't think Im ready for it just yet, But its on my watchlist. But what a fantastic wrap up, soo descriptive and honest and the way you convey your emotions throughout the list made me make a list to watch most of the 2022 list you made here. Once such anime was Bocchi the Rock. I am a music genre anime fan BUT no Idols. The likes of Mongolian chop squad and K'on. I found myself watching it because of your lives stream tier list and the comments you said about K'on. I know what you meant, It dealt with the Introvert side of a person, It actually connected to me in a deeper level. But also THE MUSIC and the Guitar.... Jrock is such a fascinating genre because of Its variety and different styles, It sometimes gives me an escape from the real world. I would say I can Kinda graduate from defending K'on and start defend Bocchii the Rock instead. I blitz this anime in one sitting on a Sunday. xD  Time to make a list from this top 15.
where moker tensei
SPY (TIMES) FAMAILY , Fite me!~
Bro, why spy x family is better than jojo part 6 💀
I never felt happy, excited, sad and engaged in 30min video like this one. it's just PERFECT!
Yall will be hearing some DRUMS 2023
as a gay girl, these shows are in fact great because of the gay girls 💗🫶
cool.
the nr 1 is an usurper the true nr 1 is isekai ojisan
Ha i asked my non weeb friend how he would say Hunter x Hunter.... You know what he said.....    Hunter²
this man somehow put chainsaw man in 5th place but we all still agree in his 1st place
I just realized that all 3 of the forgers are orphans😮😮
10:15 stop spying on me GRANT
Bleach fans left the chat
I found Gundam super boring tbh, the fights were fun but I couldn't care less about the characters (except Chuchu) and the politics. Then the ending felt rushed and the drama at the end extremely forced.
Y Made in Abyss really deserves the top.
27:01 non-usidian?? What does that mean?
Not gonna lie, I really didn't like Edgerunner at all, but man, the prequel trailer with the song let you down by dawid podsiadło was insanely good. I wish the actual anime would have been as good as that.
Classroom of the Elite must have been on the list, season 2 was a banger❤‍🔥🔥
maybe it's because it's still going but i feel like you snubbed to your eternity s2
Gay girls innit
Hunter square
Good list, gonna hard disagree with reincarnated as a sword getting no love. That was one of my standout's last year, it was one I looked forward to every week and was sad when the episode was over because it felt like it just started. We had a great year overall and you captured good essence, thanks for the video review.
11:01 which show was this from ? I feel I’ve watched it but can’t figure out what’s called and it’s bugging me
never thought i would see TUS in this channel 😂
Good takes. But where's Bleach, my man?
Gigguk, I just wanna express how nostalgic this countdown with epic soundtracks has been to me. My first memories of watching you was that year long video of Top 20 coolest anime characters and it's giving off that exact OG Anime Zone vibes.
This is one of the best written, edited, sequenced video's on YouTube. What a masterpiece.
No Attack on Titan ok
Can we talk about the VA English dub for Love is War? Best Narrator ever
9:24 Insane character development from Danny, my guy went from being roasted by PewDiePie to being a laughing stock for the anime community😂
I, A Liam, feel very called out watching this late at night...
Edgerunners = 3 what???? It's the best anime of all time.
Fantastic video, Garnt. Started the year with the best video yet.
Gigguk....... Your every video is FUCKING amazing
This won't be seen, but please make a review on Bleach once the 2nd cour comes out.
Gigguk is a very good content creating channel that have done us a great deal by making content about Animes  It could be even better , You know How ?...  Get Girls in it !
Any humble guy who could tell me the sing name @ 5:47 ?
A.MA.ZING LIST!
edgerunners was great and i am a old dude and still watched it
Such a banger of a year for anime 2022
"gay girls innit?" is a phrase I want to use on daily base
What's the OST at 20:00?
The thing I didn’t like about anime in 2022 was that they were on like 4 different streaming services, Crunchyroll, Netflix, Disney plus, hidive. Anything on hidive like the vampire girl anime I didn’t watch as I couldn’t bare paying for another service. I borrowed Disney plus just to watch bleach and then Tokyo revengers is on it and summertime rendering has finally been released in the west
9:20 Wir sehen uns dann in  1½ Jahren bei uns zur EM
8:09 borat
So Gigguk married an anime girl huh.
"Reigen: A man who can sell hamon to a stand user." A more accurate comment has never been made.
"gay girls aint it?" laughed every damn time..
For the last time Garnt. Kirino and Kyousuke are 100% blood related. Stop kidding yourself.
Never thought i would ever see Mark Goldbridge ranting in a Gigguk video 🤣
MADE IN ABYSS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"3am"? nah bro that's weak shit, it's 7am
Cyberpunk was the only new anime I got around to watching this year and I have to say it really did live up to the hype. That ending ripped my fucking heart out tho. 😭
What do you think about Vinland Saga season 2?
Fun Fact, that Kita-chan FU is Canon, confirmed by the author
your way with words drags me back to anime time and time again
summertime rendering is extremely underrated
wait is my man Gigguk a fellow DannyAarons fan?
Love is war is soo op but why did u put it here on no6
you're a goddamn genius gigguk 👍
Gay girls innit
EdgeRunners was an incoherent mess. I can’t believe people are so obsessed.
24:20 Instant goosebumps hearing that sond. What a banger.
Nice, I watched everything in this list except the golf anime 😬
made in abyss i cried for a full 2 hours nonstop then felt extremely relieved because never in my life have i cried that much
that boeing 747 line man😂
Made In Abyss truly is a warm darkness. Its despairing and cold, but also incredibly warm and bright at times. Its just such a brilliant and masterful piece of fiction that is just impossible to pin-point down. Though if I tried, I feel the only word that summarizes it would be...breathtaking.
Your videos are so good i'd like them 3 time if could , i'm glad to follow you since your Early vidéos, thanks for all the laughs you gave me !
Peak Anime YouTube by the GOAT Gigguk
wait until chainsaw man s2 gives us the gayest girls ever
vamoooo messiiiiiii
Crunchyroll: I don't think so
Gay girls innit gets me everytime
I'm just so glad that I saw Made in Abyss in that place. Masterpiece.
Ahh i just started Made in Abyss cause i wanted to binge it this just hypes me up more
27:40 Never seen made in abyss but the music alone gave me goosebumps. Holy cow!
I have to disagree with Spy Family place, should be at least on the podium.  But i'm so happy to see praise for Call of the night, it's a chill experience tailor made for me (and my fellow night owls i guess)
this finally gave me the courage to watch made in abyss season 2 i was so scarred it would let me down i didn't wanna watch it at all but now i cannot wait to see the continuation of my favourite ever anime.
In a way, Gikkuk’s video built up as the video near its end. It started with jokes and memes then slowly became more somber and emotional… until it shattered all expectations and ended on a surreal note. This has to be, not only the greatest anime videos, but one of the best portrayals of a media I’ve ever seen in my life! Round of applause to Grant! You deserve all the views and more! Keep up the wonderful work! 👏
Sell Hamon to a Stand User. That one killed me 🤣🤣🤣
made in abyss... man that anime gave me goosebumps and gut wrenching feelings every episode they managed to represent the emotions in such a beautiful way it's legit indescribable
Dammit this was supposed to be haha funny why you gotta make me tear up like this?
That song alone makes Made in Abyss anime of the year.
I Never liked makuma, She never did anything for me.
MADE IN ABYSS IS GOAT!!!!!!!!
Bro We are in 2023 at the end of its first month... But still i happy cus at least u are faster then "James gunn" still not released DCU upcoming movies list
why no one is talking about "RENT A GIRLFRIEND S2"?? I LITERALLLY LOVED IT.
the fact that blue lock's mangaka designed japan team's clothes is truly the best anime moment of the year
love is war got me to pick up anime and manga again
That meme at 8:27 hahaha can't stop laughing
nearly every day has something anime to watch but for whatever reason the highlight anime of my weeks right now is the eminence in shadow, I don't know why but I can't wait to see what happens to the master of bullshiting next.
And guess what..I've watched all of these  animes except the number one... Alright guys I'm heading to watch made in abyss.......  Edit: and yeah, i finished it...it was truly a masterpiece and kevin is a true genius I've ever seen in anime...no need say any more than that..🥲
where the fuck is jojo
no jojo??
I'll have you know it's 4AM, thank you very much. And I'm not _still_ up, I woke up two hours ago.  (That makes it worse, doesn't it?)
The 2022 year of anime was amazing. The 2022 year of regular TV shows was the worst of all time (Velma and blood origin I will just put in 2022 because it might save 2023)
The guy who named  Liam right now "ayo wtf"
That's why you are the best anime video creator of YouTube. I love the way you edit your video best synchronisation with you audio
your content is nice but holy shit you are cringe
Absolutely stunning
Seeing bocchi in 4 made me tear up a little bit
Damn i didnt expect lycoreco to be that low
This man ability to talk about bread and then this.
Probably the best year in anime of all time
HEY! waaaaitaminute.. 😐 I opened YT to search for online jobs... How did I end ip here?!
Fookin tomato
Smooth transitionssssss
"gay girls init" made me laugh every time
The one true Gigguk Man, great video!
summer time rendering is the best anime of 2022
25:40 I just heard the start of that song and instandly started crying again. This show is unreal
2022 was a good year.
2022 was one wild year of anime, with some truly great ones. Which, kinda pissed me off because I was waiting for a goddamn SLOW season so that I could catch up on some of my damn backlog!!  Screw you, 2022 anime! being all good and all!
I totally agree with made in abyss, this year did have just too many top tier competitors, but mia will always have a special place in my heart and mind
Seriously made in abyss is nomber 1????!!!
Oh wow this just shows how many shows I still need to start why is it when I ask for a new season of a anime but when we get it I am not going to watch it
I’m pissed blue lock wasn’t here
Great video. I honestly have to say that Mob Psycho 100 is a perfect anime for me. I had already enjoyed the manga and loved every single season of the show. Such an amazing experience.
Kessoku Bando will stay in my playlist. It's not anime music anymore. It's just proper rock. Heck, they've even covered "Rockn' Roll, Morning Light Falls on You" from Asian Kung-Fu Generation and I didn't even realise it was a cover because all their other songs are on the same level of greatness.  If there's one complaint I have about their music is that it's to intricate and hard to learn. I'm sure this anime has inspired many people to learn to play guitar or to pick up their guitar again. But those people can't play any of their songs even close to how it's played originally because of how much skill they require. But hey, if that's the only complaint I can think of then they're doing great!
in just a few minutes, he successfully convinced me to watch made in abyss. a true genius with words indeed
Man mark goldbridge always cracks me up  "What a Prat"  *THUMPS TABLE*
When you watch Made in Abyss, remember that by convention moving to the right is toward the future and the left is the past. I don't have to mention the up or down.
20:08 woof woof
Literally every anime this season was amazing. But I still think call of the night was dogwater
too many children in the thumbnail
MIA for me has never missed, I guess you can say the video game is bad but the show goes crazy.
Only took 4 weeks to upload again
Angry Rantman at 09:40, that was unexpected 😂😂
That borf 14:35
Ive never even seen made in abyss but the music still sent chills down my spine
For me, Blue Lock is No. 1  Also, I like how he didn't include Cote or Shield Hero S2.   The light novels are better.
17 4:14 - Birdie Wing: Golf Girls' Story 16 5:10 - Paripi Koumei (Ya Boy Kongming!) 15 6:51 - Lycoris Recoil 14 8:01 - Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru (My Dress-Up Darling) 13+12 8:14 - Ao Ashi (Aoashi) & Blue Lock 11 9:47  - Yofukashi no Uta (Call of the Night) 10 10:55 - Summertime Render 9 12:14 - Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen (Entertainment District Arc) 8 13:32 - Spy x Family Part 2 7 14:36 - Kidou Senshi Gundam: Suisei no Majo (Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury) 6  16:37 - Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic 5 18:21 - Chainsaw Man 4 20:28 - Bocchi the Rock! 3 22:53 - Cyberpunk: Edgerunners  2 24:25 - Mob Psycho 100 III 1 25:57 - Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou   anyway, congratulations Gigguk!
Didn't you forget Attack on Titan Season 4 Part2?
How to make golf fun to watch? Just freaking remade dan-doh bruh. One of the best manga out there, and the anime is shit it bring the whole series down.
Good list. But I'm disappointed on the Suletta slap not included in the video.
finally got to see another banger video of gigguk!
One of your best videos in a while. Had to laugh at every gag. Keep it up.
Fun Fact: Eiko is the reincarnation of Kongming's wife
I am scared of meeting the man who could cook up made in abyss.
Gigguk is the best youtuber of animes of all times, he is a man who geanully loves animes, i love your videos Gigguk, have a nice day
Kevin Penkin is such an amazing composer and i love all of his work to death
Where is rent-a-girlfriend Gigguk!? 😭
Spy x Family took me from being a guy who accepted that he didn't want to have childeren especially not a daughter, to wanting to have a daughter and protect her with my life.   Of course Gigguk would be a Makima fan...smh my head  Guess I need to finally get around to watch Made in Abyss season 2. Might give it a full rewatch since I haven't watched season 1 in a while.
Fu*king hell! You're a legend!
I don’t think I can take Gigguk/Garnt even remotely serious anymore, not that I did before but now it’s like what even is this video when he didn’t even include Bleach TYBW or JoJos within this top practical 20 list of this past year even if it’s just his list, he truly is the epitome of Trash Taste.
Best anime related YouTube video of the year...again
Damn the Nr1 transition got me.
bocchi the rock - you say you don't like moe and cute girls doing cute things, but didn't you say you enjoyed magical girl site?
gay girls innit
This list was so mid
Really sad you didn't mention "Isekai Ojisan" or "Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to" as they are the funniest animes of 2022 !
Almost half of the anime in this list deserves to be number 1 . But I'm glad it turns out to be MIA , because of this season it is now the best Anime I've ever watch
Gay girls innit lol
10:09 It's 3:28 and I already had _some_ sleep.
Everytime, every fricking time I hear Old Stories, I end up crying. What an absolute masterpiece of a song
Where is attack on titan
Ok but Wht about aot or bleach
Bro forgot bleach tybw 💀💀
The world cup was great and Stift, but here is your reminder that hunderts of people that had to work like slaves died to build the stadions
I'm so Happy that Made in Abyss is the #1 on this List :)
Worth the wait
Liam. Liam what? Liam-hike-hon-jai.
6:48 I asked myself the same thing with Uma Musume as soon as I saw them get on stage. At least with the absolutely mid second Wixoss spinoff, Wixoss Diva A Live, it was right there in the name. (I wonder if Wixoss is done for good this time? It didn't even get a second season. Though the actual TCG is still going so IDK)
Wow, when I came here i wasn't expecting to see Bocchi beat chainsaw man on the list. It's great and it deserved to be in the top 5 but damn
missing so much worst list actuaaaally trolling
"Bocchi the Rock" anime came out of nowhere and flips the table of this season animes is like Bocchi in the anime itself.... quietly up the stage, then rocking out the performance
Gigguk back with another peak video 😭🔥
No AoT and TYBW???? No rumbling or that crazy plot twist?
Angry Rantman breaking barriers.
Honestly I was saying for a long time that made in abyss s2 left me with an emotion I didn't even know existed.
It truly was a good year for the lesbians👌👌
there was a world cup in 2022? Figured they'd sell tickets, then claim covid something something, cancel it and no refunds.
2022: Year of the gay girls, innit?  Great recap, as always. I'll definitely refer back to this for those few I missed, like Summer Time Rendering.
Im so sad eminence in shadow wasn't here
When he mentioned night owls watching YouTube videos at 3am...  ...it was 3am while I was watching this video.
I prefer anime Sport by far to Real sports. The tickets are cheaper and there free parking.

Does anyone know the OST that plays when Made in Abyss segment starts ?
Overflow seson 2
Dude is gushing about made in abyss not realising that he just randomly dropped the most insightfully descriptive anime themed/related video one could do +10 years into the game…  I’ve watched a good percentage of my favourite creators eventually get formulaic and predictable(both in the Anime Community and in Other Mediums too) ol’ GRANT over here is still killing it, while still finding a way to sound like a giddy 5 year old talking about his favourite shows, man doesn’t realise just how great the quality of hsi own content because he’s too busy praising the quantity of other people’s content.   Oi Gigguk, read these comments and see that we all appreciate this video as much as you appreciate these shows too. Good one dude.    P.S: The part about some creators getting for “formulaic and predictable”; guys it’s okay, most of us get it- times change and so must we. Just keep the spirt in mind 👍
Did he forget about Attack on Titan Lmao, It definitely deserved somewhere in top 10.  But Made in Abyss being number 1 is awesome as more people can suffer with us :)
Guys , Did he forgot about attack on titan came out last year or something.  Because I didn't see it in the  list . And summertime render deserve to be top 7 . At least better than spy x family.
If you ask how is anime 2022 This video say it all
My favorite show of 2022 was Ao Ashi, I loved every thing about it so much that I decided to read the manga of it, the twist here is that I don't read. There's only 1 manga that I had read prior to Ao Ashi and it was Haikyuu.
8:33 that Mark Goldbridge clip is sooooo iconic lmao
5:00 song?
Lol fuck off with night owl shit, I work third shift. Got a laugh outta me ngl
what about eminence in shadow
Bump
I still cant listen to " I want to stay at your house" without getting misty.
Bro, gigguk speaks of everything I've felt while watching (word for word) and that's why I'm here all the time.
Gigguk when Big 3 returns breaking records 🤷  Gigguk when 14 year old plays guitar 😍😍😍😍😍
Chainsaw man not anime of the year? I sleep Bochhi the rock not anime of the year? Real shit
nigga put chainsaw man over demon slayer
unironically 3am when garnt called me out 😵
Umm why isn't Bleach and AOT there?
When did Gojo and Kitagawa get married, I’m so confused. 1:10
Love gigguk but he so wrong about chainsaw man not meeting expectations
People come here for anime i come here for the memes...we are not same bro
Glad people enjoyed world cup this year but can we all agree qatar need to be investigated for humans rights violations. It was like as soon as the first game started people forgot how horrible the conditions were for the counter it was in.
“Gay girls, innit?” Perfect running joke.
Who else got the Shazam ad
"The man so full of bullshit he could sell Hamon to a Stand user" How do you one up yourself everytime
No one likes Demon Slayer!
Lmao it's 550AM at my (overnight) job and I'm literally being called out rn 😂😂 10:10
Not gonna lie, I disliked this season of Made in Abyss, I didn't care for any of the characters, knowing they were only going to be tortured for the sake of torturing little children (mostly girls). It felt like the story wasn't moving at all, nor were the characters developing at all. I actually kind of started to hate Riko as the main character. She does absolutely nothing, shows no empathy or fear for the horror that's happening around her, the robot Reg acts more human than her. All the things I overlooked before, just caught up to me. The concept, the world building, the voice acting and the ost are still worth the watching, but I really don't get it anymore, with the story as it is right now.
This year was truly a mess for lot of people irl, but in terms of anime... Yeah, that was a great year  Thanks for another video of "Anime in year" from you. Each year I am making myself more convinced that I did right decision to subscribe to your channel in 2018 after checking multiple videos of yours (Tokyo Ghoul and Attack on Titans in minutes did pretty good job at advertising you even among the post soviet countries XD) and especially after watching the video called "The greatest thing anime has done". That was surely the right choice.  Good luck, congratulations on your marriage. Wishing the best for you and Sydney! Keep being on of the best anime youtubers :D
Nice list but where is Bleach s2. It showed the same amount of content as CSM s1 for example, but you are refusing to count it.
Fucking amazing video
6:09 These sequences felt so asian, I forgot for  a second Im watching a Gigguk video
gigguk always knows how to describe anime and the emotions that come with it. So glad he's an anime fan 🤧
I never understood why the lengh of the videos is so important. I mean if you have something to actually say then i dont mind having a 2 hour video about it. Its just when its lenght without content it becomes a problem.  Is there some youtube algorithm that fucks creator for longer videos or am i missing something ?   P.S give me a 2+hour of best/winter/summer/spring/fall anime lists everytime if you have something you want to talk about.
Another great vid unga bunga 😆😆
What a legendary video! I'm speechless
Everyone is sleeping on Romantic Killer. Give the show a try, please.
Didn't watch a whole lot of anime this season, not nearly as much as i did back in 17-20. I've got busy with life and at times i was really overwhelmed. But the few shows i watched were polished gems that genuinely helped me trough the hardships of this year. 2022 might be my favorite year of anime in the past 7 years i've been consuming this medium.
My favourite chinese character juge lee ang
Isn't jojo part 6 from 2022?
"...Unless you're in America" Yeah... I used to enjoy going out at night.
where the fug is bleach?!
Gae girls in it 😂
A year passed. Gigguk married. but... he still has his stuff over the floor as true sigma.  29:54😂
I like because mob psycho
These annual best anime round-ups are like no other!  Always feel a genuine sense that if I were to convince any mate watch these videos, whether they are into anime or not, they'd give these anime a chance!  Feelings of excitement and trepidation for watching made in abyss now 😅
You’re a master storyteller Garnt. Thank you for everything.
Gigguk always does a good job boiling down all the important things, ensuring a lot of people don't miss out on something they'd love. Having said that, Edgerunners has a bad timeskip & an even worse ending. Just watch Akudama Drive & you'll likely quickly see the difference between writing with an ending in mind & a purpose & just writing "cool shit". It all builds up to nothing in Edgerunners. Having proper character development in 12-24 episodes let alone in 10 is a skill for sure. It's not the easiest, but we've seen it done before. Trigger is always style over substance & it's probably the last time I'll give their shows a chance. I just don't like their way of story-telling & always find them to be empty. The one show I kind of like (Darling) isn't even their show really.
Birdie wing was my fav show of last year
Plot twist: this video is actually A.I. generated
Amazing
where is akebi gigguk!!!
Not one isekai... Eminence in shadow 10/10
This was one of the worst “best of” you’ve ever done IMO!!! I’m not attacking or anything!!! I’m just saying you put anime that didn’t have the same impact as other anime had the season that passed!!!
FINALLY
Really just snuck this one in at the end of January, didn't ya Garnt
Best??????
26:06 Sorry, not finishing the video. I recognize that art style and the characters, and I haven't watched the new season yet, and I absolutely refuse to be spoiled on Made in Abyss.
10:10 Excuse me sir... It's actually 2:30am and I am fine.
chainsawmans fandom to a tee
Garnt explained exactly what i feel when watching made in abyss
Made in Abyss for Best Anime of 202x
W to made in abyss
Weard no isekai this year
It was actually 3am when he said I should sleep but . Fuck u no
MIA2 is overrated imo.
Made in Abyss man, holy fuuuuuuuuuck... I can't keep it together man, thanks for making it #1
10:48 is gotta be the best Cameo I've seen in Gigguk's video.   If you don't know his name, it's because he's confused.   How can he die, when he's DEAD!   I'm not gonna raise my voice.
Boooo bleach wasn't your favorite, we light the beacons by sunrise! Nah, seriously this was the most beautiful articulation of explaining every anime in a way that ended me with tears, and inspired me to finally watch all the shows I keep hesitating to watch
22:01 Yeah starting to get annoyed by this; Bocchi isn't an introvert. She's an extrovert. Introverts do not _necessarily_ have social anxiety.  _I_ am an introvert. I do not have social anxiety. I just don't enjoy being around most people. Generally speaking, introverts become psychologically exhausted by dealing with people, and recharge with some peaceful alone time. Yes, it is more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. Bocchi clearly gets a boost from making connections with people and spending time with such people.
My goal for 2023 is to actually watch anime instead of just watching videos about it.
My goal for 2023 is to actually watch anime instead of just watching videos about it.
“get girls innit”😭😭😭
to be fair, named Grant does sound so much more grandiose... ;-)
I agree that demon slayer us good, but better than call of the night and my dress up darling? Nah
Where aot?
Bro forgor Bleach fr.....
I am so happy Gigguk not only he mentioned Made in Abyss but also placed it number 1 in the list, almost no one I know has seen this masterpiece and happy people will now do after this video. Thanks Grant!!
I've seen Abyss S1 and the movie but I'm going to rewatch it with my wife tonight so we can watch season 2 together for the first time lol.
Well done "Garnt", well done 👏👏👏
i havent watched the vidio yet but i cant wait to see this hot take
Gay girls innit
18:41 So, not being a manga reader. . . Chainsaw Man was anime of the year. It is something truly special. At first I thought the first episode was lame and formulaic, until I realized it was a full-blown satire of the typical shonen protagonist origin. That completely recast the first episode, and really the entire show, in a new light. Denji is one of my all-time favorite protagonists now, and Power is my favorite character in that show, maybe my favorite supporting character, though everyone is fucking fantastic.  19:23 Hey what the fuck man? I don't play Super Smash Bros. That game is lame. If I want pvp I'll play Elden Ring, or whatever Soulsborne game is having their return event at the time. And Power is great because she has a demonstrated capacity for growth and a lovable innocence to her, while also being a bloodthirsty killer. I'd help her rescue her kitty without asking to fondle her. . . although, I might ask to watch the next time she murders someone.  19:39 Smart money is on her turning out to be the main villain. She's extremely manipulative, taking advantage of Denji when she knows he has no worldly experience into risking his life in an extreme way, and her powers are too extreme and tailored for villainy for her to not be the bad guy. Hell, I once _wrote_ a villain just like her for an RPG, right down to the exact superpower she demonstrated in the season finale.
There was no intro, not worth 😒
"Gay Girls innit."  Gigguk 2023
Everytime he describes a anime it gives me goosebumps
Gigguk -- PEAK CONTENT!!! Made in Abyss desires the win!
This video is a work of art
I still haven't watched Made in Abyss S2, I still don't have the happiness, the day where I wake up, don't have anything to do, no responsibility but only happiness, that's when I'll watch it and break my fucking heart
Sooooo actualy
Wtf is attack on titan
Nah not gonna watch made in abyss I don't wanna cry
I don’t know what you have smoked to thinkt that the World Cup was something to celebrate
Heckin love these
As always A+ for editing man
Bro literally 3:06 am when he called me out
It makes me somewhat proud that ive seen all these animes and disappointed at the same time becuz i was here to find something new that was recommended by gigguk..
11:10 That's what sailing the high seas is for. Summer Time Rendering was a fantastic anime.
except for chainsaw, it was plain cringe
So sad you didn’t use the clip of MP100’s OP to transition into Made in abyss 2… Great video otherwise!
10:13 (glances at time)  Fuck you.
Every time you remind me why I am a part of this beautifully crafted medium. It's not just a medium for entertainment, it's an emotion that needs to be passed on.
Me after watching trash taste: Was this episode written by an AI?
THATs VVHY hes THE GOAT
Wheres Bleach !!!!!!!!!!!
Ah yes my favorite furniture shop Ufo-Table.
10:07 no need to attack me personally i hit the like button.....( at least my name not liam tho.)
AUUGGHHH
The only thing good about Witch from Mercury is the begining and the ending.
20:35 anime ?
Dang… the whole year passed already.  Kaguya high on the list and I’m sold.  Happy new year everyone! (crap it’s the end of January)
Not Liam but did watch this at 3 am. Psychic giga confirm?
Based list, -Not gonna lie, summer time render  is a top 5 for me it was such an amazing find and it just kept getting more and more exciting with the antagonists keeping up with the mc no matter how many steps he get over them and the show looks soo good visually with an amazing art style! -When you finish an episode of an anime you can just go continue you life but with Made in abyss you stand there looking at the seiling trying to understand what you just noticed and this is something very rare in media that's why it's soo good! -The way i can describe mob s3 is like when you beat the final boss of a game and you get the ending but then the game makes you come back before the fight and you findout that you still have importants side quests to finish that will let you unlock the true ending! -Also bocchi is just like me FR!
Okay. The fact that little bit of music for Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury sent a shiver down my spine (In a good way) is reason enough for me to watch it.
summer time rendering is my favourite anime this year
bro 12:01 caught me off guard
made in abyss is  a masterpiece
war in ukraine
My favorite was definitely Bocchi for going so far and beyond what anyone would expect. Cloverworks in general has been my favorite studio this year with how many beautiful looking shows it produced with Akebi's Sailor Uniform probably the most underrated one. Second favorite studio was P.A. Works that made ideas like Paripi Koumei and Akiba Maid War work. Then, there were the ones that I really enjoyed for being finished shows like Cyberpunk, LycoReco and Summertime Rendering, not taking years of waiting for a next season, but finishing the stories they want to tell in a good amount of time. But I also really enjoyed the Gundam anime and I am so excited for S2 in April. And yeah, Made in Abyss was special as well, though I would have wished that anything Riko had encountered so far seemed to have ANY effect on her. Like, I get she is interested in the abyss, but she barely reacts to any bad thing happening. Which makes it really hard to relate to her.  And here some of the anime that I felt went under the radar: - Eminence in Shadow --> Really funny Iseaki, like seriously, they basically make fun of the whole genre (guy steals a piano just to create a cool moment) - Executioner and her way of life --> Also Isekai, but with an interesting twist and where the MC is actually a character living in the world - Shine Post --> Yeah, it's idol, but if you think you know that CG always looks bad, I challenge you to find the moments where they use CG in this one - Requiem of the Rose King --> Anime about the rose wars of english history, but with Richard III being born neither man nor woman (really interesting show with a bit of Game of Thrones type politics mixed into it which makes sense since this war was an inspiration for G.R.R. Martin), just the animation is probably one of the worst this year - The Demon Girl Next Door S2 --> Comedy anime and I found it similarly funny like Bocchi even though the gags are differently done - Fuuto PI --> Kamen Rider show that I enjoyed having seen nearly nothing of the original (they use a new character as the insert to explain everything new to the viewer while Kamen Rider already has every ability from the original show)
So I’m awake and it’s 4 am and Garnt called me out when talking about call of the night lmfao. Also Summertime Rendering is amazing. F Disney. Gundam getting love let’s gooo. CSM, Kaguya, Cyberpunk, etc etc so many bangers
This is why I watch Gigguk, every single video he made have some kind of emotion attached to it ( most of the time it's funny hehe peepeepoopoo ) and Best of the year is the one I'm hyped up the most thank you so much for doing what you are doing
And again: Probs to your crackin’ good video editing!!! And Greetings from Germany!
Bro the last ost i thought its from terror in resonance
kinda sad you didnt give any honourable mention to the eminence in shadow even though you said you would,but nice vid regardless
*me watching this is 3:42 am when he calls me out*
2022 is the "Year of the Yuri"
19:32 was the best thing.
Great video this year! I watched almost every anime from this list, the only exceptions being the football ones.
see you next year
perfect ever seen Waooo
23:37 ayo sus
OMG furries weren't furries but they were Makima simps!
where is this soundtrack from? 4:50
"It's 3am..."  It was 3:33am here when that was said.
I'm surprised Komi didn't get a shoutout. I know some people had issues with the animation in Part 2, but I thought it was great start to finish.  Ranking of Kings was also excellent. It's quite a bold move to choose a mute protagonist, but Boji is the real deal, and the relationships we see throughout the series are just incredible. Every character has an arc and growth, and you so rarely can guess where a character will end up. Daida seems like he's just going to be a Joffrey character, but his arc is far deeper than that. And while Hilling initially comes off as the typical evil stepmother, she ends up being one of the characters you root for the most.  My anime of the year is probably Spy x Family though. I was an avid reader of the manga and the anime didn't disappoint. If anything, it exceeded my expectations and expanded upon some previously sparse scenes from the manga. Plus, it's such a funny, heartwarming tale that's beautifully written, animated, and scored. Seriously, all the OPs and EDs are such bangers.
i love how dress up darlings section is literally less than 30 seconds because we all know how good it is
made in abyss season 2 hit so hard to me to the point i couldnt process what i just watched and sobbed like a bitch.
Sell hamon to stand users 💀
The amazingness of Cyberpunk Edgerunners was the sole reason I decided to give Cyberpunk 2077 a shot, and man I did not regret it. It has come a very long way since launch and is actually an incredible story in itself.
Hey Gigguk I'd love it if you watched the eminence in shadow. It's grade A trash and I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you're into power fantasy.
Akiba Maid War is the biggest underrated gem of the year. If you like the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, you'll absolutely adore the show. The ending had me crying tears of happiness.
This is a banger
19:30
The way 19:59 just hits different.
7:43 so those two girls are a couple or what?
Kongming and Dress up Doll were my absolute favourites
Putting komi and watamote in the same category feels like a cardinal sin.
i see no jojo :o
Of course it's Made in Abyss🥲
Never thought i would see a Mark Goldbridge clip in a gigguk video
Oh God, my name is Liam and I am watching this at 4:24 AM… Goodnight
Kaguya sama sucks. Change my mind. Literally fell asleep every episode warching it with my gf.
Dang this was an amazing year. So many of these animes have been everywhere and they're all just amazing and some of my favorate series and seasons of said series.
Gigguk really said January release and then procrastinated till the 30th
25:06 literally made me lol
Me watching at 3:20am because I just got of work
Broo gigguk is just amazing in narrating and writing
we all know why this year was the best for anime ever.... gay girls innit
Finally, kongming and witch from mercury getting their spotlight!!! Proud to be an enjoyer of these shows. Im kind of sad that kaguya finally had its finale, but ive heard thqt its getting a movie (copium) Funfact, if youve watched slow loop last year, there is a reference to bocchi on ep 10 of them playing on the festival, and on bocchi there is also some cross character interaction in nijika's sister's bandmate.  Goddammit garnt, hearing i really wanna stay in your house triggers ptsd.
Gigguk I will have you know it is 2:19 am thank you very much. Not 3am
Fuck this is the first time, in a long time I’ve actually watched every anime on this list, just shows how iv gone back into my neet ways….
I am a Kaguya and CSM manga big fan, I think kaguya and bocchi’s anime adaption is way better than chainsaw man.
It's official. Great anime brings out the best in Gigguk. 🏆
So the last episode of attack on titan is gonna be: Attack on Titan Final Season The Final Edition Final Part Final Episode
Grant putting In man United fan TV... I'm dead
Gay girls innit
Ok I like the list but I’m so surprised that he didn’t put bleach it was without a doubt my favorite anime in 2022 idk if he was only doing new seasons and new anime’s not anime’s that came back but it doesn’t make scenes to me
I've re-read and re-watched the entire creation in the abyss about 53 times.  And every time I notice something new or look at something from a different point of view. I was hoping for the top spot on this list.:)
this year had a lot of gay girls innit my wifu from csm hasnt come yet
Holy shit... . . Gigguk... . . Not a single isekai in sight!
Goddamit I love ur no. 1
holy expletive i need to watch MiA S2.   i.. i didn’t even know that they did this. but i am not surprised after that haunting soundtrack.
The lesson here is that there is nothing that can't be improved by adding cute anime girls.
Gigguk put me on made in abyss and while I'll probably keep watching, I sorely regret it. If you watch this and never cry, then you scare me.
can’t believe that the only show i haven’t watched from this list are sports anime lol
Sorta sad to not see Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute! anywhere in your Top 17. But perhaps it was just too late of an addition to 2022 (seeing as how the show is still going in 2023).
Come on, no Cyberpunk Edgerunners?
Damn made in abyss in first. probably more people will watch it now .
ahh i see Garnt is also a fan of Macross 82-99
Great, more animé fucking crunchroll/funimation doesn't have in Australia
9:41
5:08 MY MY MY I GOT A PENISS 🗿
Well shit, I think I might be getting back into anime.
for me summertime is no1
Chainsawman manga is speedrun  When in anime you watched only 30% of the manga but 10% of the story Its a greatest experience of every emotions you never had Absolute masterpiece of Tatsuki Fujimoto Pls read his manga
Lol .....  to. Sell. Hamon to a stand user.....
Not gonna lie 2022 was such a great year for anime that I forgot the last time we had a year so filled with amazing shows
Well, at least Spy multiplied by family is not as bad as saying Came Hame Ha instead of Kamehameha :3
The mob to number 1 transition had me applauding
30mins never ran out so fast
YESSSSSS GIGGUK, THIS IS ACCURATE ASF
Your explaination for mia was so good
Shhhhh. It's night. Let me night on.
chainsaw man met the hype idfc
So freaking glad to see Bocchi on the list!!!
Attack on titan ??
he says its 3am and as im watching this it's 10 til, WTF lol
I watched this video at 2am and Liam is my middle name, I feel attacked
Can't wait for winter 2023 in a nutshell
yea we have a gr8 2022 and 2023 here in Ukraine. But thank you for ur work and videos that help to forget whats outside for a moment.
YES, I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU PUT MADE IN ABYSS 1ST. its such an amazing journey and the struggles.
Bocchi the rock and ya boy kongming were by were by far my biggest surprises/favorite anime this year
I love bocchi the rock
glad you gave bocchi the spot it almost deserved (should have been number one) instead of writing it off as a generic sol like you did in the nutshell video
Can we all just appriciate gigguk for how he can perfectly explain shows with the way joining our emotions more
My name is Liam and  i have never been called out so hard in my life
Sooo... there's 3 anime actually worth mentioning out of this list..."man there were some good anime this year" ????????????????? fucking addicts rationalizing their obsessive behaviours about teenage girls and japanese media tropes.
forgot Akebi on the cover >:(
I did not expect all the football references I’m pleasantly surprised 😂❤
Man that "mob psycho 1 into number one on your list" transition is fire fr fr
Gigguk, how about attack on titan?
This was really Keanu Reeves’ list
Godamn the Uber ads keeps coming 5 times destroying the scene when gigguk starts making an explanation in video......
I've never seen a worse list in my life please Gigguk why 😭😭😭😭 the fact you didn't include peak, the only masterpiece to come out, 86. Hurts. 😭😭😭
I really enjoyed most of season 1, but honestly by the end and then watching the movie and learning about the manga's content, I can't in good faith recommend Made in Abyss. The pedophilic stuff is just too much. I appreciate that SuperEyePatchWolf has that caveat in his discussion about it and I wish more creators would. It sucks, because the world is so fascinating but it's just too much and I don't like that people still perpetuate that it's ok to promote this show.
Great video as always, I will (some day) watch all the anime in this list and in the past year list that I have not seeing yet
wish that berserk memorial edition got a shout out even if it wasn't a whole new adaptation or season
I was reading on my second monitor when the #1 pick came up and before i could realize what was happening my eyes were full of tears and my heart was heavy. Made in Abyss really hurt in the best way. HADI!
It's actually 3am right now O.o
As for Animes that made me feel things like never before: Edgerunners actually did that for me. Not cause I haven't seen anything like it but cause its execution was so flawless, that even though I knew this is cyberpunk and I knew where it was going, it still hit as hard as it did and frankly I can't recall a single piece of media that made me ugly cry like that fucking thing on 2nd watch did...
Ngl Made in Abyss gave me the biggest feeling of adventure that i ever felt. Watching people going into the unknown without any much information and with propably no way back, uncovering history, dark secrets, new creatures, artifacts and other stuff is amazing. Not many shows, books or other media can capture that feeling and i love it.
Mob Psycho S3 managed to bring every supporting character full circle within the span of half a season, and  does so gracefully.   How did Ranking of Kings not make this list?
School girl - sailor moon Romance / harem - Love Hina Mecha - legend of escaflowne and evangelion Also tenchi muyo was good 👍 I'm old...
'22 was the year that pulled me back into my chair and made me watch animes religiously once again... fml ^.^
Made in Abyss season 2 felt like discovering anime all over again. I was in complete awe every episode and the storytelling was peak, not to mention the incredible music that really transports you into this new world. It doesn't matter how many years it takes to finish this story, I'll be there waiting.
Made in Abyss is not one I would have put on first place personally, but I also wholeheartedly agree with everything you said about it Garnt.
Woah Angry Rantman's camao was surprising🤣
I really really didnt see that number 1 comming at all.  4,3,2 it was mostly a matter of order but all expected. But I actually paused after 2 thinking "what the actual hell was better than any of those listed so far.   I didn't give the 2nd season a shot yet, but now I will. Thus far your rankings top 5 never dissapointed.
Family: *Gets excited for the anime ranking to start so we can watch some of them together* Garnt: #17 (Intro plays)           Me: ........ Don't look at me. He's the one suggesting it.
2:06 Blocked countries: United States ... I can still see the vid... am I not in the US?
Can anyone name all the anime cc doesnt get most of them
For me, the level of scriptwriting is basically lemmino and gigguk... Then everyone else. Absolutely brilliant video yet again
Damn Garnt, why you have to bring it so hard. This commentary is making me feel some pretty intense emotions, well done.
I really want to stay at your house still hits hard
10:09  East coast. 3:20am now..  Yofukashi no Uta was my anime of the year. I'll accept it this time.
Laughing at BLEACH FANS hahahahahahahaha not even on the list
10:09 the fact that it’s genuinely 20 minutes pass 3 am for me rn😭
I watched made in the abyss thinking it was a cutesy anime, oh how wrong I am.  If you want to have ptsd and deep seated trauma, then this anime is for you, it's an emotional roller coaster.
Dang man, I saw Mob wasn't number 1 and I started thinking "Dang man, what's 1 then? Time to get mad". Then that sound track kicked in and my whole body got goosebumps.
it is 3 am.... how did he know.....
Nice editing Grant
Who else was literally watching this at 3 am on the dot?! I never felt so called out in my life!
No fucking way gigguk got Granted at his own wedding!!
Waverless waver
2022 summary : gay girl everywhere
Thank you 2022's Anime
When it was 3AM and I was watching YouTube videos I got scared for a second thank god I’m not named Liam
10:07 bro did you really have to call me out
poor Liam
It’s 3:10am and my name is Leon. Jesus Christ I’m like a millimeter off from being called out by name.
Congratulations 🎉
This video truly belongs among the S-tier videos on YouTube. And I really mean it, the quality is just unbelievable from the insane descriptiveness, to the amazing editing with perfectly placed memes. This is as close to perfect as you could possibly imagine. Thank you <3
Bleach?
Dang it's actually 3 AM as I am watching this, I'm sorry Gigguk I'll go to sleep now >.>
Been following the channel since Anime Zone and have yet to be disappointed by the content. I don’t think I would be nearly as much of an anime fan as I am if Garnt’s insight and videos didn’t exist.
Mob Psycho was ended so beautifully. One of my favorite shows I've ever seen.
Garnt just upload this on facebook video, Youtube sh;tass ads ruin it.
NOOOO MY NAME IS LIAMMMM
Can't wait for Peter Grill season 3.
alright fine garnt  ill watch made in abyss
Holy Shit is 3:00 AM, that bit actually sacres me F U C K
oh boi i cant wait for the next season of spy multiplied by family
For the love of god please try utawarerumono the trilogy just ended and it’s a gem
Gigguk tell me you are scared of the furries, that's why you included kaguya sama. It's fkn bullshit how it's compared to FMA brotherhood and AOT in terms of popularity. You just made humanity cry in the corner.
Couldn't agree more, Made in Abyss is seriously unparalleled
This is the third year Gigguk hoed AOT from being the AOTY 💀
It's literally 3:01 am rn and I was not prepared for getting called out lol.
Me, literally watching this video at 3:01 am.   "Bruh, why you gotta call me out like that"
No Akiba Maid Wars? You suck!
I'll have you know in my time zone it's only 2:00 am. Checkmate
You right about call of the night reminded me of going out late at night to skateboard, empty streets, lit up lights
the way he just brushed over mha in a few seconds was hilarious
love it! have like the exact same list different order
I will disslike this video just to show my disagreement about you watching the world cup 22. Still good video
oh i had no idea mob came out damn
Summertime rendering was my favourite one this year its so underrated And I kept avoiding it because it didn't really look interesting
No eminence in shadow?
Man, I love this video
I will never shut up about summertime rendering being my biggest surprise of 2022 as a new anime title. I hope more people get to watch it because it's that good. Shame that it's limited to certain platforms.
I'm scared enough to watch made of abyss
Where is Ranking of Kings?
even you shitting on cyberpunk when skyrim was just as botched holy shat
gigguk did bleach dirty
Great video Garnt
We Gundam fans thank you Gigguk for bringing more attention to Witch From Mercury. It's certainly a well undervalued show, especially in the west.
10:09 nope... is 4h48am cuz I'm working the night shift.
W
What about to your eternity!? Second season was so good and answered so muck but left us wondering how it will end. I’ve cried and fell in love with so many characters. Bon… never thought I’d like him but now I love him! Ugh
Wow, I missed a bunch. Anyone got a month or two of time they want to donate so I can catch up?
Me 30 minutes ago: Oh nice a Gigguk video I can enjoy whilst eating breakfast 30 minutes later and I'm ugly crying over a season of made in abyss which I haven't even watched
10:07 _Listen_ It literally is 3 AM for me, you don't have to call me out like this.
Unpopular opinion:   I really hate Anya, she's stupidly annoying.
Aint no way Bleach didnt make it :(
The fact that there is no AoT is kinda insane
Honestly I know so many people who have cyberpunk and chainsaw man in their top 5 of 2022 and I’m same I rlly hope this is the end of the cookie cutter isekai era and beginning of edgy in your face action era
Thank you for including the world cup in the list,, indeed it was the best sports anime this year!!
You really outdid yourself on this one man. Amazing amazing video
Ok now I see why everyone was so hype about this video. 10/10
ayo how you gonna call me out like that. i LOVE K-On.
Im so glad you are giving MiA some attention, it deserves so much more But the mangaka can go eat soap for the rest of his live, if you read the manga you know what I mean
you definitely need to catch up on Bungou stray dogs, this show is fire and I want to see it get the recognition it deserves
someone: hmmm... what kind of ost this battle of robot with girls inside should be someone: yes
Nah this list is just like me fr
Not the goodbye boogie dance introoo
GET GIRLS IN IT - gigguk 2023
At 10:13 in the video I feel personally fucking attacked. Cause I am litterrally watching this shit at 2:34 in the morning knowing full well I gotta get up early to go to class tommorrow.
the fact that aharen isnt up here
It's called soccer
It's crazy how good this year was. Even anime not in the top 20 were good enough to be number one if released in a different year
I will never forgive the choice for the "crazy mix" category. Koumei? Really? The show with a grat idea that massively underdelivered? Like the whole second half of a season feels like a filler?! And not a single word about "mainds were yakuza all along"?! The great show that DELIVERED! Not a single episode that felt weak or filler, wild ride from the first second to the last.
"story is not important as long there's flashing colors on the screen" the most mature anime watcher
19:32 yoooooo ahahahahahahahaha
Gay girls
I'm so sad the eminence in the shadows isn't here. The manga is way better than the LN and anime(based on the LN). I recommend the manga way more than the both of them and if they had adapted the manga it would for sure be in the top 20 best anime this year and definitely be the best comedy anime
Last year was a banger, hope this one does some too
Last year was a banger, hope this one does some too
Place 1 for my fav anime! Wonderful!!
To your eternity not on the list  Opinion disregarded
How have Bleach fans not crucified this man for not including it on his list
Was hoping that romantic killer would get a mention at least, but I love this entire review reguardless. This whole anime year was stacked!
What's the song at 9:47??
This video was a masterpiece, the way you transition all the videos was amazing
I love how made in abyss 1 and 2 are both gigguk's anime of the year. 2017 and 2022
Man gigguk I love ur videos so much  God bless you
Git girls innit
Me watching this at 3 am fully awake getting called out like this
that makima edit is the best part of this video
the words of the years *"gae girl, aren't it ?"*
I just finished the first episode of summer time rendering. Damn. I love this channel just for these kind of recommendations
Why did you have to do Belgium like that
Never thought I see danny aarons and mark goldbridge in a gigguk video
I'm not really into anime it's just the same thing over and over again there's other series of Marta and animal of the same thing over and over again my Goblin Slayer sister worst anime I ever seen even redo healer so yeah I don't know washington-watch Dark theme stuff just ruins like the human brain just gets had enough of it you know like at your ruins your day you know
12:10 holy shit its drip mikey 🤣
Where was ninjas tweet for the entertainment arc sheeshhhh
I cant believe that jojo part 6 isnt in this video
Ittoki is mid af
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOATTTTTTT THE GOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Gundam Witch too high. No way would I put it above the likes of Spy x Family and Demon Slayer.
made in abyss and mushoku tensei cour 2 was defo my top animes this year just the worldbuilding storytelling and everything about them pulled me in just as much as the first seasons did and i love it for that but id be lying to myself if i didnt say lycoris recoil wasnt my number one show this year just because of how much i enjoyed it
Bocchi the rock jhonson
To all who watched Chainsaw Man but never read the manga...   He's straight unequivocally right about what he claimed, that you ain't seen nothing yet! That's no hype or exaggeration, ask any CSM manga reader if they think that's true. If they deliver even close to the degree of what's to come in the manga, then there will be shit shown that your mind will cease to function until you are able to process what the fuck you just witnessed. The visuals may reach the point of absolute absurdity and make a permanent (good)stain in anime history in all the right(wrong) ways.   Oh god, this is going to be way too controversial, I hope they don't dumb it down...
I dont like any girl from chainsaw man
I felt called out around 10:19. I'm watching this video at 2:18 am. I am the night owl. Hoot hoot
AGAGAHA I FORGOT TO FINISH MADE IN ABYSS GOD DAMNIT HOW COULD I DO THIS
I don't know what it is about Gigguk's videos, watching him describe my favourite shows so perfectly and eloquently, I just can't seem to hold back my tears.
Made in Abyss js truly beautiful
Made in abyss is painfully beautiful ❤️
I won't lie, I tried to watch Made in abyss the movie and season 2 but I couldn't.
banger!!!
I think my only disappointment is that Lycoris Recoil wasn't a bit higher
Who's name is actually Liam?
another banger video from gigguk
Looks like there is a imposter among us
You really have to step back and see this year as a whole to understand how fucking good we ate.
one thing i learned about how to entice audience last yr. put some gay girls in it.
That "Sakanaaa!" scene lives rent free in my head.
Goddamn this video was as hilarious as it was informative. Time to reactivate that Crunchyroll subscription.
Its 10:00am gigguk
Hahaha while watching boochi the rock i giggled like crazy.
Bleach fans eating salt today hahaha
For those still not sold on summertime rendering yet it was so good and intriguing my own mother recommended it to me to watch it. Just like out of the blue texted to me that I should watch it.
Only if chainsaw man did facial expression and don't made it to cinematic it would be amazing
I was able to watch Made in Abyss and Mob Psycho 100 thanks to Muse Asia. And I am thankful to them from the bottom of my heart.
how badly does disney hate anime that ive never even HEARD of summertime rendering WHEN IT SOUNDS AND LOOKS SO GOOD WTF
gay gurls innit
What's amazing about Made in Abyss is that : I haven't watched S2 nor the movie yet, only watched s1, but this summary + images + musics parts still hooked me, and gave me chills, several years later. Man, the s1 opening's still resonating in my soul. I don't know if I want to watch movie and s2, I don't know if I even want to listen to this opening, just because it has too much impact on how every parts of my body and mind connect together.
Why exactly are people praising made in abyss so much? I dont get it. I tried watching the first season. And it bored me. Nothing exciting happened. It just seemed like any other benign exploration anime mixed in with some "mystery" and "horror" And the mystery to me did not even seem compelling enough to keep watching. So i quit halfway through. I dont even remember a single thing of it anymore. Im not trying to hate on the show. Its just how i remember my experience with the first half of season 1.  So. Someone please explain to me why its generally well received.  So i can understand.  Is it the character writing? Because i dont remember anything outstanding there either.  Also get the hell out with demon slayer. The story and character writing of that anime doesnt exist. Neither does the pacing. Or world building. Only good thing about it is the fight animation. And then this good aspect gets ruined by the anime completely forgetting near mortal injuries and or heavily incapacitating injuries 2 minutes after they happened. and not following the laws and rules of its own universe. Because plot. I watched it up to episode 15. I just couldnt bear with it anymore. I really dont know how its possible to mess up pacing considering season 1 got 26 episodes. Usually that happens with 12 EP seasons. I was hoping it would get better. It did not for me. Its the kind of of stuff i could come up with. Anyone for that matter.   Now then. Just as with made in abyss. Id like to know why its so well received either. Id like constructive counter arguments to the loose criticism i gave.
I expected better from you.made in abyss no 1?no way
I'll admit I'm bias with bleachs return. Damn 10 years for its final arc stealing the wholes studios budget. Ichigo gave no f&s, old man yama went all out  and so did the animators.NOW YOU FEEL LIKE NUMBER 1  So its obvious  demon slayer won best fight of 2022.
My name is Liam but I am in fact watching this at 2 in the morning for your information.
Made in Abyss is peak fiction. Highly recommend you watch. Make sure you know that the movie comes in between season 1 and 2.
TO YOUR ETERNITY??
bleach? :")
Truly ya boi kongming was amazing I didn't expect it specially the songs that was portrayed on the episodes.
Finally we all know that chainsaw man is mid
The Gigguk x Mark Goldbridge crossover was something I certainly wasn’t expecting
You should do a video about HIGH CARD
I keep rewatching the entertainment arc not even because of the animation, but because of the voice acting. Holy shit, the voice acting delivered so hard.
Cried a little when saw Made In Abyss S2 at number 1, totally deserved.
kongming's op just slapped and it really was a "well fuck it im in" moment. Its even better with RGB Captions or YaBoi KongMing ASCII Art Captions :D  Made in Abyss S2 just absolutely vibe checks the fuck out of you and you have two choices: finish the ep at like 1am, silently weeping not to wake anyone and just sit there knowing you wont sleep that night, or finishing it some time during the day and just deflating in your chair because your feels have been obliterated you don't get up you don't move you just stare into the void no thoughts head empty
Its kinda weird to see, that in Germany, the population tried (alr beforehand, not after Germany was kicked out) to kinda not watch the Worldcup as much, because of all the bad stuff that happened in Qatar (iirc the viewership of nearly all games was cut half compared to other years), while in every other country viewership records were broken
27:44 Hearing Faputa shout with that background music always hits me hard. Utmost respect for the VA and salute to Kevin for the absolute masterpiece of music.  And I totally agree with the wonderful description by Garnt. I was feeling in the back of my mind that you will put Made in Abyss at the top and when you did it, I was feeling absolute happiness.
For those who don't like anime OK I understand but if they said because is a cartoon then I have to say they wrong, anime is worlds culture
This is good content!
Crunchy roll have to fix it's awards nominations and timings
IDK why but I always feel emotional towards anime with how gigguk presents them like yow get out of my brain. I didn't even watch some of these shows and I felt attached to them from this video.
So top 10 had summer time rendering... GREAT
So this is ranked. And is AMAZING
that mob psycho transition is so damn good
what was the anime at 1:27 (with whales swimming in the sky)?
Ok ok ok ... Wait.  I always put MIA in my #1 plan to watch lists but for some reason, never watched it.  I always knew it is known for its amazing story and soundtrack and I even voted for MIA soundtracks and all in anime polls but I never actually Heard them sitting down.  I think this video will be my trigger
Its obviously Spy cross product Family pffft
Marin: HEY GUYS (screaming voice) it's your girl.
I was starting to get confused about what the top 3 were when Bocchi the rock showed up at #4.  But Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Mob Season 3 and Made in Abyss 2? 😭😭😭😭 He is way too right
His opinion on twfm be based fr fr
Chainsaw Man never really gave me a hype (You know cuz I read the manga and then bilibili decided its bad for our contry) and I was like 'I think Im gonna watch a show that hyped me up' then Bocchi showed up at my head AND. IT. IS. A. BLAST.
24:15 This song will continue to haunt me till the day I die.
Here for the anime recap.. AND GOT AN ABSOLUTE RECAP ABOUT THE WORLD CUP 😂😂😂😭😭😭
MY NAME IS LIAM BRO SPOKE TO ME PERSONALLY
As somebody who's up at 2am watching youtube because I can't sleep... maybe I'll give Call of the Night a try.
This is the most beautifully compiled recommendation of anime. When it's Gigguk I know I can blindly trust him with his anime recommendations, some of these shows I had already watched and loved, and some I had on my watchlist. Now I'm definitely gonna start watching them.
There's a show from like 10 years ago called Harper's Island that Summertime Rendering immediately reminded me of.
i can never forget Tifa's special guest appearance in that senate meeting😭🙏
Bocchi the Rock :)
thanks for a great year garnt! can't wait till you name mushoku tensei season 2 greatest anime of 2023!
For 2023 check out Buddy Daddies for another found family anime
I got shivers when I heard old stories start playing. Just goes to show how deeply Made in Abyss hit me.
BRO I WAS EATing at 11:59 and I literally spit out all of them in my mouth LMAO
i could not agree more with how you described what watching made in abyss felt like, i have never been so deeply affected by a show before
Gay girls innit
All top top 6 could have won only if they weren’t against made in abyss
Mark goldbridge😂😂
No bleach?
Liam. Where you at brother? Get to bed already
Boksu practically owns Gigguk's channel💀
Ok
Una banda amigo
where the fuck is bleach, what is this dogshit list
I remember when I started reading call of the night and thought to myself that maybe I also need to try and wonder in the city night and wind up all my trouble. it was a fun experience, until I got mugged by a drunk homeless guy for an entire pack of cigarettes.
for the world cup was the best anime man messi being the goat ronaldo being a bench rider, truly gorgeous also the ultra realistic animation
All of this is 100% invalid because he pronounced non-euclidian wrong
It's 1:30 am sir
God Dammit Garnt now I want to watch more 2022 anime (that I missed) because of this video. Man, I even decided not to watch them.
i don't get how Chainsaw Man doesn't live up to expectations, when it IS just the manga made into an anime. like how does that make sense when it couldn't have been better
Gay girls innit
I know this video is about looking back at the breathtaking year we had, but there is an anime that I would love to hear Gigguk's opinion on. That anime is Vinland Saga in its totality. Otherwise 10/10 video GREAT JOB
Bleach
animebridge!
10:15 I AUDIBLY GASPED! 😭
I wouldn't know about last year's anime because I only watched One Piece and Stone Ocean lmao
the Best thing about the Demon slayer Entertainment district arc, was the fact I thought it was the weakest arc in the manga!! can't wait for the next few seasons!!!
Yeah calling demon slayer mid is cool cuase joey
what.... to your eternity ??
Why do both football anime this year have the word blue in it
Gigguk never misses
How you described Made in Abyss was precisely how it felt for me! I usually watch anime during my meal breaks, but I just couldn't eat while watching this anime. There's this weird unsettling feeling that just made even food unappetizing for me while watching it, which is sort of an indication to me how great of an anime Made in Abyss is!
borf
1:10 LMAO I can't stop watching it XD
Rebecca got done dirty...
Bro the Kessouko band songs are literal bangers btw, go check their Spotify releases
Me waiting for JoJo to show up🥲
Bocchi the Rock was nobody's Most Anticipated Anime. But man did it dominate
bleach needs to be tallked about
dude, irumyui story legit made me wanna puke straight up
starts the vid, hits the like button cause ive been waiting on year... i swear if you changed any of the beats..... ill just keep watching
2022 was the year of gay girls, innit?  Also called it, Gundam S tier after the finale
I think part of what makes Chainsaw Man such a hit is that is effectively doing to Shounen what Evangelion did to Mecha.  Eccentric creator pours massive amounts of talent into a series with a main character who is the polar opposite of the norm for the status quo within its genre, especially one that is and would be irritating in real life. It doesn't hold back the darker, or even sexual themes while not glorifying them as most shows do. It's unconventional in it's approach to storytelling, characters, themes, and is not afraid to embrace it.  Both have Waifus that have hit the community like a fucking freight train.  Both are easily marketable.   Both have a simple initial premise that has FAR more going on than the story would openly admit.  So, they're completely genre-flipping titles that are easy to get into, have the bait to spread like wildfire within the community, incredibly popular music, but also have complex themes beneath the surface for those who wish to read into things, both made by eccentric creators who's stories' aren't afraid to take the simple concept to the logical extreme for the sake of the story... even at the expense of the audience itself.  I genuinely think we might be seeing Eva's successor, depending on where the story goes and ends... it could be *THAT* special.  I've followed along with it with my GF, and we've been enjoying it a lot to say the least. It's a good way to break her into that style of story. I'm hoping to get her into Eva eventually.
I Cried Watching This
Gigguk has put mob psycho on second place just to make the transition
So what your telling me is....... gay girls init..
Amazing Video man.....Enjoyed it a lot....
W vid
I didn't even watch most of these seasons. And this was an amazing video. Thank you once again, Gigguk/Garnt!
sometimes i listen to gigguk's ending monologues before sleep,  i sleep better that night
I’m still confused by how unwilling people are to give Chainsaw Man season 1 the respect. I don’t understand how it didn’t meet the hype…. To me, it exceeded it. This show discusses concepts of grooming and consent in a way that is just not typical in shounen. I feel like the people who thought this was overrated are the people that rooted for Denji and Himeno to hookup and thought the boobs plot line didn’t have a more genre redifining direction.
And goramit, Spy x Family is just wholesome as fuck!
I didn't cry. You cried. Garnt has a unique ability to summarize a show in a way that's both funny and deeply authentic. I can't imagine the amount of time you put into this video, and I thank you for that. I can't wait for next year's list. Truly GOATed.
Also  86
his wife cute af she is one lucky girl to have him, she needs to treat him better.
No hate against cyberpunk but until you have watched arcane, you can't put cyberpunk in top 3. Not in the same year you say?? Arcane transcend yearly top charts
Bocchi is definitely "The Surprise Anime of 2022". It went beyond expectations 0 - 100 real quick and the best part is it was consistent.  _Boccher_ _Drip_
respect for adding mark goldbridge in there XD
this video truly encapsulate the anime of 2022 thank you Gigguk for showing the best of 2022 in the best way possible
Kaguya sama's commentary is spot on.
Garnt woke up and chose yellow dollar sign. Very happy with unfiltered video. And MOB s3 placed second - fuck yeah
Watching your videos has made me watch some really good anime that i have missed out, such as Mushoku Tensei, Re:Creators, and more to come. Love the content, Garnt!
😂 After watching spy x family, I finally remembered about how an actual family works.
"Gay girls, innit." -Garnt, 2023 (I STG we'd better get more Kongming, Lycoris and Birdie.)
I legit jumped when I saw made in abyss on this list. Season 2 was insanely good but no one was watching it so I wasn’t expecting it to be number 1 on the list.
I feel like I only watched like 5 animes this year. But my Japanese studies are doing great, I can now talk with natives on a decent level...
We waited 5 years for a sequal and it was totally worth it.  2022 had amazing shows and I think I will come back to them in a few years.
idk i can handle a lot of horror but made in abyss season 2 was just way too much for me. I think Mob was better because more people can watch it
Man, I was hoping jojo stone ocean would be somewhere on here, but otherwise, great list!
Everyone just shut up and go watch made in abyss. It’s worth it.
Good list, only one I didn't care for was Gundum...just reallly dont care for Mechas though personally....no clue why.
Man Gigguk's literature teachers throughout his student years must've been reading fire after fire whenever they tell him to make an essay. Everything in this list is amazingly descriptive of what it is and the emotions you'll feel when viewing it, to the point that it feels like I've already watched the anime despite not even seeing a single episode about it. A true blessing to the anime community indeed.
BLUE LOCK DESERVE HIGHER!!!!! HAHA I LOVE IT SO MUCH!
Made in Abyss made me want more story so I checked the manga. I am sad because there it's not much further ahead.
Just now realized that Mob is the Mirror Universe Akita. An esper who keeps it inside.
Disappointed Urusei Yatsura didn’t make the top 30 :(
I think the manga and anime put made in abyss into words perfectly how it makes at least me feel it’s truly a warm darkness in the truest sense it’s beautiful and nothing short of a masterpiece I’m very excited for the future of it. Loved the vid as always keep up the great work!
So glad Gigguk payed respect to my favorite anime of the year:  The 2022 World Cup
i feel like the video length made you tone down a bit on the meme edits and it’s really done this video a favor, such a joy to watch
My man using link click ost for the ending of the video les gooiii
garnt shouting out his homie
these rankings are near to perfect, but where is bleach though
made in abyss may actually be my favorite anime. it's.. hard to really describe why. there's a passion to the story. each character is defined as their own character. you never see yourself making the same decisions they would make. motivating each other the way they do. you simple watch and wait to see what happens next while a part of you prays nothing bad happens the to charges l characters you love. Because that's what this show makes you feel. you're not rooting for these characters to succeed. you want them to go home. to be in a protected space where you can breathe easily. but you know that can't happen. so you cheer for their little wins while begging and pleading for them to be safe.   Maybe that's why this show is so hard to describe. because how do you describe what it feels like to be a parent as you watch your kids step into the world on their own?
Congratulations on the marriage! That's huge and best of luck to both of you:)
made in abyss BASED opinion
Oh god did made in abyss break me… how depressing is it gonna get by the end 😭
I will never watch Bocchi The Rock for the same reason Garnt will never watch FMA.  I will never watch Mob Psycho because I think it's pretentious.
Made in Abyss aka the only thing in the world that can blueball Junko Enoshima.
Call of the Night has honestly been my show of the year. When the show finished, I pretty much immediately picked up the manga and started reading. The story has gotten so good and the action is pretty intense too. And the songs are straight bangers.
Anybody know what the anime with whales is at 1:27?
Made in abyss not being an option in crunchyrolls anime of the year category is a joke
god that was all last year??
cool
Wolf
To me saying Makima is best girl is like people saying Monika from doki doki literature club was best girl.
10:07 Actually it's nearly 6am for me, and my name ain't liam, but it's the thought that counts or something
I Loved Both Demon slayer and Summer time rendering I highly recommend to watch
26:06 Dub? BOOOO!  SAY NO TO DUBS. Subs Only.
At least in the US, Disney plus only has Disney made or directly owned content, with everything else going on Hulu.
you missed out on uncle from another world
As soon as the Made in Abyss piano started, I got hit with the feels before I even placed exactly which ost I was hearing.
I love you garnt
Angry Rantman!!!
Where is aot
Fully expected bleach to be number one and I was letting saying...ummmmm? Lol
W Year for anime for sure :')
"Get girls in it!" - grant
Damn didn’t expect that gigguk would choose made in abyss season 2 as number one for him. Damn kuddos and salute!
The gundam had me at one scene at the last episode where sulleta pulled a cannon and the enemy shivers..
Where is Bleach tybw
24:16 Too soon
I got my shit together when you called me out
That Jason Bourne cut was fantastic.
Another year another perfect yearly review!
Glad Aoashi was mentioned. Absolutely loved it, but it got overshadowed completely by Blue Lock.
I may not agree with the order in this list, but even still what I can say is that yes, every single one of these shows are fucking bangers, holy fuck this year was fucking amazing...
You Sir are the Artist that prop all other Mega Artists up. They Sir are hello lucky to have you in their corner. (Sharp tooth smile and all.) 🏆👍  Now relax and go chivvy your Brothers up at Trash Taste to tell them how Barbarian their taste in Frozen Bread is. 😉
Bleach???????
Sunrise?! So THAT’S why the new Gundams look like the Knightmares from Code Geass.
Made in Abyss is truly a family friendly series
Demon Slayer Entertainment District arc was missing one thing, and that was when the Sound Hashira learned the tempo to the Demon's attacks, they didn't time the flurries of strikes with the music.
That misheard lyrics will be stuck in my head all day. Thanks, I hate it. XD
Garnt is still too afraid of the weebs to be able to say what he really thinks about Chainsaw Man. It met the hype head on and everyone's expectations were thoroughly met, the only people who were disappointed with Chainsaw Man were people who wanted to be able to hate it.
So Mark Goldbridge and Angry Rantman finally made their debut? They've now finally achieved success.
Birdie wing was goated I have no idea why I enjoyed a golf anime so much.
Fantastic. There's a few on the list I need to catch up on, but I can't thank you enough for your original recommendation of Call of the Night cause WOW.
Gigguk putting that classic Kongming clip there makes me laugh so hard hahaha
Damn, tomodachi game is so underrated, it deserves top 10 lol
"Reigan is so full of bullshit he can sell hamon to a stand user" I'm dead 💀
Bro I haven't watched made in abyss and that soundtrack gave me shivers instantly.  And now I definitely don't wanna watch it         Explanation: I have a thing with remembering unsatisfying anime endings for years and it unsettling me          Edit: I watched it, its mid Mabey it's cause I was expecting alot of emotion and then I didn't really get the emotion. I just really don't like riko she's useless and her being the main character ruins it for me, idk it's not a bad anime but not all that I was expecting.
I don't usually actually LOL at youtube videos (especially if watching alone) but Gigguk always fucking manages to get me with the edits.
Penis life already had me cackling out loud. Glad made in abyss is getting the recognition it deserves. 👏
Idk if he's really putting Mob Psycho on number 2 because of the "one and only one" part or something else but it's dope 😂
"So you're gonna watch a 30 min video about a guy talking about anime? " Me: Yes
no way he put Blue Lock in 13+12 tier 😂
BOCCHI
Mob psycho III sucked it was so boring the action sucked and was not necessary
gigguk you're late the year ended, a month ago. <3
Call of the night is ahead of my dress up darling . Bro what?
Couldn't agree more with made in abyss, there really is no words for this anime.
Great vid, kinda suprised part 6 batch 2 wasn’t on it somewhere tho
There so many anime I want to watch but goddamn I don't get the urge to do so... idk why... Maybe I'll try to start again... Blue Lock, Cyberpunk Edgerunners were on my list already but maybe I should get into the Mob Psycho verse and Call of the night and Made in Abyss and My Dress-up Darling and............. My god there are so manyyyyyyy!
Gigguk always has a way with words to convey how a anime can make you feel and Made in Abyss was perfectly described.
little cameo by goldbridge that was hilarious shit
Please talk about Vox Machina! Is it generic? yes. But it's being generic done well. Pls Taaalkkk. Tallk senpai
Gay girls in it timestamp: 4:34 6:59 14:36 20:29
My name is Liam, Garnt you scared the shit out of me when you called out my name 💀
Bro me when my name is actually Liam
JOJO
Anything he suggests passionately I end up watching lol
I have never been called out so hard or this publicly 🥲
Remembering this year's anime has me gazing deep into the mysterium tremendum of reality.
Its pronounced Spy Cross Family. get it right.
Koi to uso i though was great. Chainsaw man and cyber punk were excellent. Love bittersweet more realistic anime. No punches held to immerse
bro 7:57 is wild
Darn. No eminence in shadow.
Where's bleach?
I had Made in Abyss on my to watch list for so many years and in October I finally got around to doing that, finishing of course with season 2. I watched a good chunk of the entries on this list this year as well as others and I really have to emphasise how good Made in Abyss really is. It is really indescribable.
NO FUCKING WAY LYCORIS IS ONLY 15. 💀
BIRDIE WING???? I am vindicated!!!!
12:14 god dammit
Violet evergarden, edgerunners made me had that "wow" moment
Garnt showing us once again why he is the goat when it comes to making anime content.
Witch Of Mercury is my Anime Of The Year for 2022.  Fight me.
My respect to Gigguk for NOT taking the easy way out and making a tomato paste joke during the Gundam segment.
Futoku no guild and 4 in was sorezore wo uso tsuku is underrated
You definitely put the golf anime there because of the song!
I’m thankful for your description of Kaguya-Sama. Cause I don’t like it and didn’t get what the rest of you see in it… but now I guess I know why. I actively dislike most of the cast. So if looking forward to a parasocial hangout is the draw, I guess it makes sense why I don’t see the appeal. I def have enjoyed a number of other works on that same principle, but it’s gonna be totally hit or miss based on how well the cast resonates with you, so I suppose I can appreciate where tastes diverge on this one.
GIGGUK IS GOATED
Happy NEW Year guysss...
This guy is biased as fk not even a mention of bleach??? It's easily better than most anime on this list
The One Piece snub will be remembered for 2024
Makima, Power, Himeno, Reze, and Kobeni are my Chainsaw Man waifus.
Good to see you're on the future funk wave with the intro. ✨️
These jokes are all hitting
Gigguck I love you man 🔥🔥🔥
my god the transition with Mobs OP to #1, absolute genious
19:32 Simp for Makima.
No JoJo Stone Ocean? Surprising
Lycoris Recoil was the best anime of 2022 *for me...* the story mattered, thing happened, characters were good, I knew nothing going into it, and at the end I was wating for the next episode to drop every week to watch what would be of the story, the ending, wich can be the definite end but also leaves space for more seasons, was good, I wouldn't say it was perfect, but it was very good. The thing that I liked the most was how the characters felt real, none of them felt like they had plot armor or that things magically got solved.. it was awesome.
Shout outs to everyone who was celebrating their birthday last year
So did AoT not make the cut? lol
great video gigguk as always . this truly was one of the best year for anime.
did he really not mention bleach?
wait is Spy X Family is Spy Multiplied by Family then Is High School DxD High School D^2.
Gotta admit that's the first time I've been called out by name in a video
Your prose amazes me everytime, fantastic overview!
Think I agree with just about all of Gigguk's top 20 choices except for the order.
Oh shit the crazy bastard did it, he put bocchi above csm. Cant wait to see people cry about this
One piece in top 10 in 2023  Gear 5 loading....
Made In Abyss deserves its placement! Love that Gigguk loves it and Keven Penkin.
hell yeah! Made in abyss babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Love Live had one of it's greatest years in 2022 and still no love from Gigguk lol.
2022 pretty good year for watching gay girls in anime. Honestly probably the best overall year for anime ever.
😭Why, why couldn't you talk about Bleach😭.
i keep forgetting dress up darling was in 2022
The 2022 world cup was my favorite anime this year, had me on the edge of my seat every game
Bro wheres Danmachi season 4 at
Personally I liked Cyberpunk Edgerunners better when it was called Cyber City Oedo. But then, I'm a decade older than Garnt. I would say that.
No no no, no no no, how the actual fuck did you get my name right and how did you know I’m watching YouTube late at night, this is scaring me
To Your Eternity is right up there near the top for me
Everyone knows that the best Golf player in anime of all time is Melt...  ~With "everyone" I mean *I* know.
3am is right after I take lunch
I had a rough idea made in abyss would be your no.1
Dude I’m throwing up, this made in abyss season made it so obvious how much of a pedophile the writer is it’s actually disgusting. I don’t understand how people can’t see that
13:53 spy multiplied by family? tf is wrong with this guy? it's clearly the cross product of spy and family.
With Demon Slayer, I wonder if there’s a power ceiling for animated intensity itself.
This year really was just "gay girls innit" huh?
You dont enjoy Made in Abyss, you dont watch made in abyss, you experience it
It’s Kevin Penkin’s music, innit?
please dont spoil summertime rendering since most people havent watched it because disney
W... Wait... Disney+ has anime outside of Star Wars Visions?   Whomever is in charge of marketing that branch needs another job...
So glad to see Made in Abyss getting the recognition it deserves! Trust me... the journey is gut wrenching... but oh so worth it! XD
7:56 love the little detail of the background lol
Spy 10 family
Everyone knows that the real way to say Spy X Family is: the cross product of spy and family  Edit: After thinking about it for a bit, this unironically actually makes a lot of sense. So hear me out: the anime is essentially showcasing the PRODUCT of CROSSing the two very different concepts of spy and family as Loid forms a fake family. In addition, it makes sense mathematically as the magnitude of the resulting vector is the two vectors multiplied which reflects Loid's exponential increase in workload, causing him to be tired as shown in the anime. The direction of the resulting vector is also perpendicular to the original two vectors which indicates the change in direction of Loid, Yor, and Anya's life due to the formation of a fake family.
Gigguk will and still the standard for Anime reviewer
9:42 Never ever would I have imagined to see a Angry Rantman clip being played in a Gigguk video.
i love when garnt
Congratz to you player
What's the name of the music in 9:48 ?
Masterclass in vids 👌
leave me alone Gigguk, it's not even that late.
no Akiba maid wars ?? rigged
Gae girl, innit?
The Made In Abyss section was some of your best work. Beautiful.
my name is liam and its past midnight.... how bro💀
Zhuge Liang was so savage, he killed a man with emotional damage xD 7:56 Ok that's a pretty good reason to watch Lycoris Recoil
How on earth does Bobobo-bo-bobobo qualify for "safe, marketable shonen anime"? lol  Great video! I'm going to check out that Gundam show due to your recommendation.
Holy fuck, I swear best anime of 2021 felt like 6 months ago
Man this was such a great video 🙂
This is basically a recommendation list for some anime that I didn't get to watch this year. But a big bruh moment because I didn't even know that a continuation of Made in Abyss came out. I didn't see much word from the anime community about the new season.
Made in abyss in it's rightful place among a STACKED year. It hits different
The witch from mercury music gave me a literal chill... you're 100% right about the sound design
I CANNOT believe that Made in abyss and Mob psycho where not in the list of anime of the year.
Does anyone know the song of the made in abyss right after the ending??
Golf=boring. Birdie wind=exciting. Leave it to anime to make Golf; a dull game for old men in to a  cute girls hitting balls with super moves.  Birdie wing deserves a place. I loved this show. (Got me to text my uncle) "Why is golf good?"  I.E. its still a snore fest. but Anime made it look cool. (Thumbs up for "Girls Golf Story".)
Kinda disappointed that One Piece didn't even get a shoutout after such a packed season this year
In case you wondering about another hidden gem of this year, check out Shadow House. It has already 2 season out. And I think shadow house is my biggest hit for this year. It has a great plot and story writing.
I totally agree with Gigguk list as always..
Slightly disappointed that there was no honorable mentions calling out some of the shows in the transitions that didn't make the cut, but its fine. I just couldnt stop staring at the Deaimon square because wholesome Dad anime gets me the same way SpyXFamily does.
lolll the mark goldbridge clip 🤣
7:56 thanks a lot for that pic because we didn't get the full pic in the anime 👌
Bocchi the rock is absolutely, definitely, no lie edition: getting overrated now 😬  [ Ok i watched it too, liked it too but sadly had to state this too]
As a person who loves Made in abyss i love to see it being gigguks favorite anime of the year.
Made in Abyss has been an amazing journey. The manga is incredible with its beautiful, gritty frames. The anime is spectacular and moving with some of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I'm constantly astounded that the voice acting keeps up and does it justice. It absolutely deserves its place and yet I'm blown away to see it so highly rated. I'm one of those people who never watches shows or movies more than once, no matter how much I like them. Even over a decade later I failed to fully watch back through Cowboy Bebop, one of my all time favorites. Yet I've watched Made in Abyss season 1 three separate times with different friends and season 2 I re-watched the first half so I could finish it with friends. Not a single episode the whole way had me pulling out my phone or feeling bored. I've put the OST from season 1 on in the background enough times it's almost in Final Fantasy territory. I still flip every time I'm watching a video and I hear someone put Made in Abyss in the background of even completely unrelated content. I just cannot sing the praises of the show enough. Here's hoping the slow manga progress and premature Season 3 announcement don't herald a drop in quality.
Dude where is winter anime in a nutshell
I guess one piece is NOT an anime TF GIGGUK
God tier review. There is a reason you have so many supporters.
just girls innit
Yea that Made in Abyss season made me both cry for the first time in a long while and secure it's spot in my top 10.
I've been waiting to watch made in abyss because I know I need a free weekend to watch it.
i feel like garnts humor just hasnt evolved n its getting  more n more unbearable to watch his videos just an opinion idk its like i was into these memes like 3 years ago but he hasnt stopped using them and like he hasnt seen fullmetal alchemist brotherhood which gives me bad vibes to his character overall...
What a production man... Amazing work as always.
Call of the night had some of the best songs of the year
Intro song is Goodbye Boogie Dance by Anri. To be more specific, it was some remix of it.
Gundam came out at the perfect time as a primer for Armored Core 6 this year
Where tf is uncle from another world gigguk (anyways it's a pretty good show guys)
Kobeni Fan here.
day 5 of requesting it to be pronounced "spy family" 💀
LFGGGGGGGGG MADE IN ABYSS AT NUMBER 1
Genuinely surprised Akiba Maid War wasn't on this list. Probably by far the funniest anime I watched this season that actually emulates Tarantino and American cinema well but still keeps it very Japanese. The ending actually becomes meaningful and interesting. Ah oh well :/
“Witch from mercury” 🤡 The rest of the list was spot on tho
14:00 who did that?
E A G L E S !!!!
Why can't anime just friggen do hockey?!  It has everything anime viewers want in a sports anime, rivalries, OP characters, grievous injuries, characters shrugging off grievous injuries, insults so venomous your Dad shudders...  Edit: It also has hot girls with massive tits that follow hockey players around like groupies.
for real why the heck edgerunner up there bro?!
I can't believe i'm seeing mark goldbridge clip on this channel 😂😂
yeah i knew made in abyss was great but im too afraid to watch it bcs im gonna cry every episode
Lycoris Recoil was better than any kicky football.  Call of the night was good. I would give it to Lycoris Recoil hand over fist.
THANK YOU for putting Made in Abyss where it belongs
MASSIVE props for putting Made in Abyss number 1, never saw an anime like that, EVER !
was saving a joint for this
No one talked about Call of the Night, and I only watched it because of Sora Amamiya-san. But it hit 🎯💯.
Pantheon??
SMOKING ON THAT HIMENO PACK‼️💢🚷❌ 🚬
Made in abyss is one of the animes that made me cry for a robot death (along with 86)
Chainsawman season 2 and 3 hype!!! (every manga reader be like)
“ Is there anything we can do to make a John wick better ?” “ Gay girls in it “ 😂
nice
This man is out here reminding us why we like anime in the first place
The Witch from Mercury is really damn good
Riko kinda trash mc tho
Where is One Piece ?
Made in Abyys is so good, it gives me the shock and power to start writing my neglected thesis...
Guys, dont forget the fact that Crunchyroll had the nerve to not nominate both kaguya sama and made in abyss for AOTY.  Just when you feel like humanity cant get any dumber you get slapped on the face with  Crunchyroll judges, unless they are just  a dumb lower non human species which would make a lot of sense
I too want to recommend Requiem for a Dream to everyone.
Just when i was so confused about what (completed) anime titles should i watch next, gigguk comes to rescue!
Really... you had to play that cyberpunk edgerunners song.... my heart is broken again.
The Witch from Mercury really deserves that spot, easily the biggest surprise of the year for me. Sure Bocchi also came out of nowhere and swept the leg, but as someone who didn't know I liked big robots Gundam really shocked me. Every episode was greatness and I felt so invested, and then the season finale hits you like a massive truck. Can't wait for the next part.
I just finished Made in Abyys this week, and BOY does Kevin Penkin does a great job.... Well deserved 1st spot
Nux is gonna love this video.
Sadly no Pop Team Epic tho
I watched Summertime Rendering on Hulu and I wish I found out about it sooner rather than in January.
10:10 sir, stop calling me out. thank you.
Looks like gigguk got filtered by Maid War.... also watch Isekai Ojisan
How wild is it that Gigguk has been doing these for a decade now?
I'm gonna have to skip the Mob bit bc I haven't seen it yet :')
Gigguk is the best anime dude Ive seen. Talento, humility, hard work, and a bit of genius. Every year I wait for his summary, and whatever hw says that is good, I watch, no máster how ugly, weird or smelly, and almost never went homenaje dissapointed. Nuxtaku was good too one day, but became sothing else.
Made in abyss season 2 was my only 10/10 anime this year, and im so glad you put it at number 1
I'm personally going to remember this year as the one where your editor got really into the Link Click OST. As they should, it's great
That moment when you realize a show like chainsaw man is nr5 and think yeah "that's actually very a reasonable spot" you know it was a good year of anime.
Every time i watched call of night episode i listened to its theme song like 4 to 5 times. It was fcking best theme song for me in anime. And i will that every anime release that season has nice opening song.
*SPOILER TO THE VIDEO* (The 17 animes, but simplified) 17.) Golf, but in an action movie  16.) Sun Tzu becoming a K-pop idol agent 15.) Moe John wick 14.) Gigguks wife 13-12.) The World Cup was made for 2022 ⚽️ 11.) The night owl who binge watched Twilight  10.) Everyone is sus, even disney 9.) Best art in 2022... almost forgot to breathe 8.) Undercover agent multiplied by family  7.) Make gundam recognized again 6.) Loving you is complicated... so let's make friends  5.) Fanservice in many ways with a chainsaw 4.) K-on though with massive dread and also good music 3.) Sucked at game launch, so let's premote with anime? (why does studio trigger keep making me cry?) 2.) Was 100% waiting for this!  1.) Tears keep flowing, but time keeps going. Cmon sis, this was made in the abyss
Shame Made in Abyss isn't on any of the streaming platforms i'm subbed too but one day I will see it.
aw man, to your eternity and golden kamuy never get any love from youtubers
10:14  OH CMON DONT CALL ON ME LIKE THAT I WAS BORED ALRIGHT
Ah finally a quality gigg uk upload
I wish to god your video stays monitized and people watch this video without their ad blocker.
Made in Abyss is a masterpiece!!!
It is so good to see Made in Abyss in the top and described with so beautiful words, this second season is truly an experience from start to end, the way it introduces itself and how it eventually answer everything in such a natural way is just incredible mixed with the amazing work VAs, Kevin Penkin and everyone in the team did to make it such a good adaptation, as someone who has been reading the manga since almost the start of the adapted arc it was just pure joy to see episode by episode the incredible work and love put into season 2.  Again really good to see it on #1 and how well is done.
what a great video and edition
Love is War is what got me beyond the "only watching popular shonen" phase. Now, I still enjoy them, but I'm willing to give pretty much anything a try and absolutely love rom-coms
where bleach
GGS Well Played Gigguk
Anybody else see Chris Hansen talking about viagra before
It's time to watch this on 2023 :)
This video made me fall in love with Gigguk's narration style once again
I cried the moment I heard made in abyss's soundtrack. I was expecting aot or csm again on top but damn, I'm really happy that made in abyss is still getting recognized despite the abundance of comebacks and sequels from other popular shows. Made in abyss was such a painful yet beautiful journey.
wasnt ready for the Mark Goldbridge cameo😂
I would have added Horimiya to the list. Kaguya was amazing, but I felt Horimiya was better. It had a different feel than other romance animes.
That's a pretty solid list, I watched almost everything from it. I missed Ousama Ranking tho, really loved that one.
Cyberpunk was my shit! I was just so happy to have a violent anime made again that appealed to my tastes! Hopefully in the future Trigger can do something with Blade Runner!
The transition in mob psycho review to made in abyss review literally sent my spine on chills. Made in abyss is definitely one of the GOAT shows out there.
i mean, those bocchi girls do be p gay tho
Bro conveniently never talked about attack on Titan besides mentioning it once
>no lotgh, instant dissapointment  Oh god, I've become a cultist
Garnt is still in denial about Marin
Bro where the hell was Attack on Titan???
There was a ton of hype after lycoris recoil came out. I watched it. It was good, but ngl a little bit overhyped
gigguk talk about kaguya made me cry
Wassup bruv 🤠😌🥂
The part where Grant... Garnt.. Garnet.. nvm. But this video has to make like thousands of people to watch made in abyss. It just gave so many chills in only 2 minutes with its beautiful music and production and EVERYTHING
For the first time ever I disagree strongly of number 1. Made in Abyss season 2 is the Rick and Morty of anime. It's not that deep nor fun.
I watched the first season of made in abyss and I thought it was really amazing, I waited and waited for season 2 and in that time I forgot what made it so special. Then season 2 rolled around and it took me awhile to actually watch it and when I did, oh my god I went from 1 to 12 in a flash I was instantly reminded why this show is so, so fucking good. The show has a special place in my heart only a few managed, and it will stay loved by me for as long as I live.
Gundam at least reaches past 10. That’s good enough for a like.
You don't have to attack me like that man
26:00 THANK YOU FOR USING THE DUB! Sentai is hit or miss, but when they hit, they HIT, and Made in Abyss' dub is one of their all time best
i forgot demon slayer latest season was in 2022 damnnn lol I still keep going back too cyberpunk tho i love that anime
bro forgot the jojos
Great list.
I need more seasons of literally every anime in this video
Wait am I the only one one who found the fan service in chainsaw man to be 10x worse than the fan service in fire force cuz you’ve definitely called out ff for it but I think it’s much more annoying and in your face despite less nudity as compared to ff
Personally im surprised to see stone ocean not up there, especially since its a conclusion to the original story thats been going on for years.
Makima please *sniff* just one... *Sniff* just one sniff please *sniff*
"Watching YouTube videos at 3AM"  Me:looks at the clock on my status bar "Holy fu- he got me"
What show is number 14?
I'm disappointed Isekai Ojisan didn't get a mention.
Aoshi and blue lock is amazing
Made in Abyss feels like the spiritual success or to classic Ghibli movies. It's BEAUTIFUL, it's PAINFUL, and it will forever change you as a person.
made is abyss... deserved👏
Bro ffs i didn't watch made in abyss but that music wth why did i shed a tear •́⁠ ⁠ ⁠‿⁠ ⁠,⁠•̀
it was a good year for lesbians
Shoutout to me for barely watching anime this year. I turned into a Joey. Give me true recommendations down bellow! VVVV
Made in abyss s2ep10 is the single greatest episode of all time.
Thank you
Why is this list in reverse?
i love spy multiplied by family
Some honourable mentions off the top of my head that are not present in Garnt's video: To Your Eternity Season 2 Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 Bleach - Thousand Year Blood War The Eminence in Shadow Welcome to Demon School Season 3 Sasaki and Miyano JoJo's Bizarre Adventures - Stone Ocean Part 3  *THIS DOESN'T MEAN HE DISLIKES THESE ANIME! He does not give credit to Bleach, that's all.*
I liked the video I leave my top here below my favorites were the first 3  My top  1# Ciberpunk Edgerunner 2# Chainsaw Man 3# Sumertime Render 4# Mob 100 (season lll The end) 5# Jujutsu kaisen 0 (movie) 6# Ousama Ranking (part 2) 7# Kimetsu no yaiba (season 2) 8# Bocchi the rock 9# Spy x Family 10# Blue lock 11# Bleach (returs)
Yeah its the best year
I still to this day don't understand why ppl get so mad that ppl say demon slayer is mid. It is mid, it rlly isn't surprising. I'm p sure even the author would agree. It's nothing insane, it isn't complex, the characters are simple, and so are the villains.  That doesn't mean it's an incredible amount of fun. I mean not to me but clearly there are a ton of people that love it. The hype, the vibe, the cheerfulness, it's a simple anime but that doesn't have to stop it from being the most fun or your favourite. It just happens to be a fact that that anime is just not very strong in its plot or characters
Where's Bleach? 😕
Wow Garnt, imagine releasing a best of 2022 video a month into 2023
It always shocks me that the quality of My hero academia is still underplayed, there are so many nuanced moral complexities explored especially in the most recent episodes but people are still caught in the early seasons mindset of black and white thinking when judging the show.
Praise be to our lord god in the abyss Faputa
I’m grateful for this man. A true man of culture or true weeb trash.
bocchi the rock anime of the year <3
forgot how much some shows this year fucked me up haha
Blue lock > Aoashi
Is this the wayback machine?
Another great video, but thx for making me cry over Made in the Abyss and Cyberpunk again
-_-
Dude I like demon slayer but it is mid. I struggled to get through the entertainment district ark and skipped most of the mugen train ark in tv format other than the first episode. My hype for this show died with the movie. Still plan on checking out the new season when it happens but this show justifies average writing with amazing visuals despite the opposite being much more impactful to me
jesus christ garnt gonna give me a heart attack saying my name
Can someone show me the Spy multiplied by family clip
I'm so glad you gave Witch From Mercury the love it deserves, I haven't been hyped for a seasonal show that much in soooo long
Unfathomably based pick for #1
It's been a while since I laughed so hard I cried. #5 did that. Well played sir.
The multiplication symbol is known as “and” it’s just pretentious spy and family
WHERE THE FUCK IS BLEACH
2:12 "we got more incredible twists" *puts clip of annie* me: *intense flashback to me losing my shit when she woke up*
No Bleach? Wtf
Made in Abyss being #1 like it should
W bocchi
This video is inspired by Chat GPT
8:30 That mark goldbridge clip tho😂😂
2022 the year of the yurii😂
no bleach and aot?
Best anime tournament arc was the world cup definetely.
HOLY CRAP THAT WAS A GOOD VIDEO
I was first introduced to Made in Abyss a couple of years ago. Right about the time covid kicked off. I went into it expecting some kind of chibi wholesome series, but god damn was I so far off. It was such a roller coaster of emotion that completely eclipsed anything I had watched before. The scene with Mitty slapped me unconscious with a giant mixed bag of emotion, and I walked away from it with a single though. "Fucking hell". But, the credits rolled on the last episode, and I too just thought, "Wow".    Whelp - I need to figure out whos cutting onions in my room now. Shut up I'm not crying you're crying.
Amazing video ! The editing, the writing and the memes ate superb !
wtf only hearing that 30 seconds of the gundam show score convinced me to watch it, well done, love me some iconic orchestra, just can't be beat
we all know it was rent a girlfriend
Almost February. innit
My Wifu is Makima
I read CSM before the anime came out and honestly I think that's a well deserved spot, this year was incredibly loaded. But do strap on for season 2, anime-onlys, that's where the fun begins. Edit: also lycoreco deserves to be like 5 spots above
ぼっち
The way gigguk be talking about them shows is the way I talk about the girl I fell in love with. Guys I think he likes anime
Ik no one asked for this but anyway here's my top 10 of the year (Among the ones I've seen):-  10. Spy × Family (Anya best daughter that's all you need to know lol)  09. JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stone Ocean Part 2 & 3 (I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending but overall had a great time watching especially the 3rd batch)  08 & 07 is a tie between My Hero Academia Season 6 & Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc (Highly entertaining shounen)  06. Chainsaw Man (It just left me hungry for more)  05. Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun (Irumyuui & Vueko's story is incredibly tragic but the best part of this season has to be the beautiful OSTs, Hats off to Kevin Penkin)  04. Summer Time Rendering (This is definitely one of the shows I'd have  loved to watch on a weekly basis, definitely the hidden gem of the 2022)  03. Mob Psycho 100 Season 3 (Although not quite as amazing as season 2 it still delivered on expectations & ended on a high note)  02. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (This is TRIGGER's best work to date & you can't change my mind, episode 6 might be the best episode of the entire year)  01. Attack on Titan: Final Season Part 2 (I'm slightly biased but this season gave me everything I wanted & more)  Before going I have 2 Honourable Mention's:-  To Your Eternity Season 2 (Although this season wasn't nearly as good as season 1 I still am enjoying it)  Berserk: The Golden Age Memorial Edition (I have my problems with the cut content but gotta say it was good actually, the addition of Campfire of dreams & Wounds definitely amplified my experience)   Anyways 2022 was a great year for anime here's hoping 2023 turns out just as good if not better.
I wanted to hear your opinions on the sword anime but I guess I can wait until more seasons come out.
I would've included link click in this list no lie. Every episode was enjoyable and the ending was crazy and surprised me
THE VIDEO WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
10:17 hah, it’s actually 03.25 and my name’s not Liam! Don’t know your audience as well as you think eh Gigguk!
Where is uncle from another world, dislike, unsubscribe))))???!
The anime zone with another banger of a video
Mob? Really? You choose most annoying characters of anime?
I always appreciate the eloquence of how you describe Made in Abyss. Or more specifically, the feeling you get after watching it. It's a hard anime to describe and recommend to friends, so I usually just link them your videos on it. Thus far it's hooked everyone I've shown it to, so thank you for doing what I couldn't! More people need to experience this anime.
Gotta respect the bit abt the top six all being phenomenal, because they are. But goddamn even just the short clips from the fucking Kaguya bit when talking about S3 choked me tf up. E13 had gotta be my favorite 22mins of anything ever made.
rip animix
You know it disturbs me knowing Garnt probably watched all these at 2x and 1.5x speed.
GAY GIRLS INNIT
cyberpunk edgerunners is worse than white boy hiphop , please white people stop , you have love death robots stop ruing other art forms with CGI with a white boys' fantasy idea of a loli
How did he know https://youtu.be/xXmXM0qRMbo?t=605
I have no idea how Garnt literally delivers THE BEST reviews of ALL TIME. I get goosebups every time i watch his videos.   P.S 16:23 i think i just wet my pants T - T
Yo thanks for the shout out Garnt and yes I know it’s a problem
Dang, he really *did* make Trash Taste!
Man, how do u get around to watching so many shows😂  I give you full props !!!
anyone got the song in the intro
I am so happy to see Made in Abyss and Summer time rendering getting justice. Absolute props bro
I really wanted to see fuufu ijou on this list :/
My guy didnt even try to fit BLEACH in there🥲🥲
Bocchi number4 you monster...
Gay girls innit?
Please tell me there are people our there like me who whenever they hear the mention of K-on they freak out
I got so tired of waiting for Kaguya sama so I finished the manga and its such a good manga/anime
No joke It's currently 3:18 AM and I was watching the video, no need to attack me at the Call of The Night part Edit: Holy shit I forgot to watch Summer Time Rendering, ty for reminding me Edit2: you know the year was stacked when Gigguk did not put Jojo in best of the year
Spy multiplied by family
Made in Abyss being Number 1 is a shock, i thought everyone but me forgot about it.  No Attack On Titan part... whatever is even more shocking. This season is easily peak AoT..
100% agree with Made in Abyss's placement here. That story is deeply moving, and personal in a way that media of any form rarely achieves.
Thank you for reminding me how good anime can be.       Now i will rewatch this for 100th time and still got shivers every time
So did he just forget/not watch about Bleach and AoT?
gigguk every video has at least one quotable moment, I'm less than 10 minutes in and there's so many, best one being "gay girls innit"
NOO grant you cut out the best part of the Chinese Kongming meme clip
I was having chills the entire time you talked about made in abyss
Shiori experience manga
Himeno fans should have been EDP in a hospital bed
Jesus this is a very high quality video. well done
Call of the night does not beat dress up darling. Not with most of the scenes being them standing still and having there mouths moving. There are beautiful moments in that show but that was bias. Love you gigguk!!!
actually its 4 AM Gigguk
Ya boy koming should be higher. I will not elaborate.
Wah the manga was better is blocked? Glad i already watched it
25:36 transition is smooth as hell
Ex arm was a cgi nightmare man
The 'Wan' in the Chainsaw Man review has me in TEARS
2022: gay girls innit
Most of these shows I watched and loved but Bleach TYBW coming back like it did with the level of excellence it brought was unmatched to me definitely AOTY for me
Most anticipated video of the year
i hope there´s a Liam watching this at 3 am
As a Liam I just wanna say thanks for the shoutout homie @Gigguk
Anya from Spy x Family easily wins 2022. She is the baby Yoda of Anime and captured the hearts of even non-Anime viewers.
Bro called me out
Made in Abyss #1 Recommended why? EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!
Bro how did you know my name
Horimaya (I can't spell) was my introduction into romance. Also Boochi the Rock is one of my favourite animes ever, also I just realized how many of my top series of the season can be described as "thing with gay girls"
special mentions to, to your eternity season 2 :D
PEAK GIGGUK 2022
Glad this channel is here giving Summer Time Rendering the credit it deserves
can't even watch summertime render if ya in america AT ALL ...legally of course
Where is the eminence in shadowwwwwww
its currently 3:06am...
Gigguk never fails to give the biggest smile of my day. :D
I really need to rewatch mob psycho from s1
Based
I suggested Paripi KouMei, it is such a fun anime to watch as well
5:09 Wait, what, why?
I was confused... all of my fav anime of 2022 has already been mentioned but we're still not on top 1.... then garnt here plays MIA soundtrack and im like, god fucking damnit how can I forget!
Holy shit this video is a piece of art
W for Made in Abyss, it completly dominates its genre.
9:42 My man made it here...
damn u gigguk, making me cry by remembering parts of made in abyss s2
the marin one W
we have the exact same top 6 just with different orders lol  mine was:   5. cyberpunk edge runners 4. chainsawman 3. mob psycho 100 III 2. love is war ultra romantic 1. made in abyss season 2  (I just started bocchi so I'll keep it out for now, but I can already tell it will be somewhere between these)
I was familiar with almost everything here but Summer Time Rendering. Big fan of time loop things (even if somehow this ends up not being a time loop) so I'll be off to watch this.
i liked witching call of the night purely bc of the aesthetic and vibe lol. it was a chill and unique looking anime.
Peak Gigguk.
this doesn't feel like a Gigguk recap list simply cause the winner isn't an Isekai XD
fml its 2:58AM
can someone send me a list with all the anime that have gay girls innit
there you go Garnt, making us laugh for the first 90% of the video with a few solemn moments here and there and then making us emotional at the last 10%. Loved Lycoris recoil, gundam witch from mercury and birdie wings!! they all exceeded my expectations.
that sidney marin part is cursed af, need to bleach mi ears 😫😫😫😫😫!!!!!!!!
10:10 Actually it's 6am..
Bruh Gigguk you cant just hype me to watch all these missed shows man wtf T.T
Made In Abyss season 2 was peak anime for me, it went straight to my top 3 anime I've ever watched.
another entry in my watch later list
I love how Garnt’s articulate delivery of every word makes me feel things. His way with words, the cadence in every delivery, the memes, the emotional strongpoints… everything. In every video, he never fails to make you feel a range of emotions. I’ve never even watched some of these anime but the way he spoke about each of them, how he ended every segment made me choke up a little bit a times or make me chuckle. It’s just videos about anime but I always walk away with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes and sometimes I’m not really sure why.
men no bleach ... ok
Cyberpunk edgerunners so good😭😭😭😭
Bocchi And Mob >>>>>>>
16:23 wow that was hype
Fuck man it's been 2 months since I've seen cyberpunk that songs still hurts and at the same time slap so hard
Gigguk is the new Anime man
Based as fuck is all im gonna say about this season and this channel
Can't believe I missed the Tifa Italy thing. Lol
Nah you didn't just slander Ex-Arm did you Grant????????
its actually 4 am
I know this comment is a meme now, but can we fucking appreciate for real how much Gigguk means to this community?
the made in abyss moment gave me goosebumps and i never watched it yet
i felt called out, but then i remembered my name wasnt liam
Nice vid
19:13 How did you know I played smash bros for 20 hours this weekend?               Finally I almost finished the video, of course made in abyss was there, but as soon as he showed the elevator I paused
Gay girls innit ?
Made in Abyss season 2 was so good
Damn you're very good at conveying emotions, this video was a great piece of media.
havent started the vid, but please talk about summertime rendering i beg of you
3 am in america 🤣
> multiplied by  Well shit, I didn't think humanity would actually take this step, but I'm here for it.
My one thought about Chainsaw Man. I have never, ever been put off by a fandom's horny nature. I even stuck around for a season of High School DXD, but the sheer amount of sheer self hate, narcissism, and debauchery in that fandom is literally to the point of being unhealthy. Even the Witch From Mercury fanbase isn't nearly as bad and some people literally just watch it for the yuri aspect.   I hope that Chainsaw Man doesn't get another season, but that's unlikely. I'd also say the fanbase for Made In Abyss is actually better than either of these fandoms and that's saying a lot.
I feel personally attacked 10:15
10:09 it actually is 3am  Bruh
Cyberpunk was amazing i am never a music guy but that music i have it saved Made is abyss is highly underrated noone watches it Why is bleach not there bro why
Banger from gigguk as always
Amazing work  Gigguk!!1 But a quick question, But a quick question, what is the name of the second song in the Mob100 part?
24:17 this song has actually made a psychological connection to crying so I now always tear up hearing this song
19:20 you did smash player too dirty
I think made in abyss is one of the only shows I watch that actively ruins my day, but then makes me want to watch it again.
fuck that bit about makima made me tear up laughing 😂
YESSSS BOCCHI SWEEP!!! WE GOING TO THE TOP OF ARASAKA TOWER!
03:45 am
Bocchi the rock is overrated. bocchi isn't relatable she is literally the kirito of slice of life anime.
Why does timestamps in this video so useless?
great video! really nailed the list, epic edition as well :) thx for sharing!  PS: LONG LIVE HITORI 'BOCCHI' GOTOH!! \m/
You have to be insane to think that you could make a Golf anime good.  Lycoris Recoil was the bomb, great anime with story.  Call of the Night was another good one to watch.  Demon Slayer is a breath of Fresh Air; worth watching.  SPYxFAMILY was not something I thought I would like till I watched it, then I could not stop.  Chainsaw Man was another good one to watch.  Cyberpunk Edgerunners was OK, not bad but also not great.  Was worth watching?  Yes.  Made in Abyss is a 5 out of 5.  There are times in this anime where you WILL cry.  Was done really well.  Here are some that I think should have been there in place of some of the other one that just had bad anime or no good story or character growth, or have been over done to the point of have I not seen this before called something else.  How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom, Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest (season 2), Uncle from Another World, Akiba Maid War
i legit cried during the first place
NOVODY IS MENTIONING THIS MAN GOT MARRIED?????????? WHAT THE FUCK DUDE PROPS TO YOU MAN ABSOUTELY BEEMING WITH FAT RIZZ
Thanks for the great content for all of 2022, looking forward to the rest of 2023.  Thanks Steve Handjobs.
The best part is that this video got gay girls in it.
Gigguk: 10:06 Me: checks the time Also me: no need to do me dirty bro 😩
i cant believe m not subscribed, subscribed.
For those wondering what 孔明 said at the past. And yes this actually happen on both books(lets not get into why there's two books) He called out 王朗 for being a traitor of his country and to its people; Helping a warlord taking over while the current Emperor is still alive is a giant disgrace(also mind you guys the Emperor is still a kid at time of the roast) His last quote was "When you die, the lost of your dignity brought shame to you and your family; Even our past emperor in the afterlife won't even meet and greet you." 王朗 basically just fall of the horse and dies. Or you can say he dies of cringe.
All trash Eminence in shadow number one 👍
ah, my fav video of the year!
Man, Ranking of Kings and Eminence in Shadow didn't even get a mention. Anime went full barrel this year.
So Summer Time Rendering, a show I will never watch because fuck that Mouse, is just an edgy teens anime version of Butterfly Effect. Imagine putting the least Gundam show ahead of Spy x Family.
1) cyberpunk edgerunners 2) spy x family 3) made in abyss 4) chainsaw man 5) kimetsu (thanks to ufotable)  6) summertime render 7) gundam 8) bocchi the overrated 9) kaguya sama love is overrated 10) mob psycho 300 11) call of the night 12) lycoris recoil   I dunno where to put attack on titan Because at this point I don't really care about it
damm never knew this top genshin streamer could do such a great video XD
You know that a shit ton of wannabe influencers are going to start reading the art of war now
I've never heard of Summertime Rendering, but your description reminded me of Promised Neverland so I am going to check it out.  I also like Sci Fi but the genre seems to have been lost since the early 2000s. I watched Gundam Seed and didn't really care for it, but the idea of a war between corporations makes me want to give the Gundam franchise a 2nd chance.
Summer time Rending was so incredible. PLEASE watch it if you haven’t done it yet. Anyone who has watched it can vouch for me
Why are the so many girl centric shows in SHOUNEN and SEINEN??? Like I know this fantasy but let's get real
I have never been more proud of garnt than when he put made in abyss s2 in number 1
You know what? I give it to gigguk, the points he makes for the witch of mercury are great and I would have to agree that even though I am not a mecha fun, I enjoyed the fights of the show very much indeed. However I dropped the anime after 5 epiosdes cause the characters were irridimably stupid, I can't be cringing my way through the anime's bumbling protagonist or the bitchy supporting cast just to have a nicely animated fight scene here and there. The only character I liked was Guel and he is honestly the only reason I would go back to finish the anime for.
I genuinely need someone to convince me to watch Made in Abyss season 2 after Dawn of the Deep Soul made me want to throw up.  I adored season 1, but I've looked up what happens in the next few chapters & it does not sound like something I want to watch, I would love for someone to explain the appeal beyond what big man G said in the video.
Dang, not a single mention of aot.
10:09 hit a bit to close to home watching at 2.30 am...
Made in Abyss enjoyers, let's goooooo!!!
I liked Amélie too Garnt!
Me who hasn't watched made in abyss but still teared up from the music and review. Definitely gonna watch it now. W summary as always.
god i loved the world cup this year japan out here not only beating spain but beating germany twice. once directly and once by ruining any chances of germany advancing by beating spain
im so happy that made in abyess number 1
I'm so happy that Made in Abyss is getting the recognition it diserves. Aside from the golf anime I watched every anime in this list and not a single one of them is as worthy of #1 as MIA season 2. I loved all of them don't get me wrong, but MIA is just special. I don't remenber an anime that affected me this deeply. At this point, I have watched thousands of animes, but not a single one of them hit me as hard as MIA did. It straight up became my #1 not just from this year, but from all time
The best sports anime was the football world cup lmao, you're so damn right Garnt
Hey everyone just wanna say to  believe in Jesus for he loves u so much that he died and was raised from the dead so that u can have a relationship with him. Believe in him and ask GOD for forgiveness of your sins :) and turn away from them as well (repent)...❤️🙂👍❤️
Thiis was probably one of the best "Best of" lists I've seen. It's a testament not only to the caliber of recent anime we've gotten, but to Garnt's insight on what makes them great too.
bruh 0:32  😳😳😳
Lots of good shows to watch indeed
I DONT EVEN NEED TO WATCH IT YET AND I KNOW ITS GONNA BE A BANGER!!!
I’m gonna cry all this over latest jojo season 😭😭
I was watching the premiere, stopped midway and binge-watched summer time rendering. Such a shame it got yoinked by Disney+.
Its a rare feeling when one of your favorite anime gets a satisfying and beautiful ending. Mob did that for me this year and i am gonna miss it every bit <3
can one single fucking person talk about bocchi the rock without shitting on K-On! ??? its so fucking annoying
Bocchi The Rock! is peak slice of life
I've been wondering for a while how I would describe made in abyss. It's an incredible anime, it gives so many emotions that are contrary to each other yet they fit together perfectly, and some emotions that I cannot even name. The story is a work of art, the music is the best I have ever heard in anime.  The experience of watching the show is something that will bind people together for years to come, for it is an unforgettable experience that I believe has changed the way that I view myself as a person.
Boys, Summer Time Rendering is back on streaming and can be watched on HULU now. I hyped cause I missed it on Disney+.
gonna be that guy where is one piece?????
Mark Goldbridge x Gigguk is the crossover I never knew I needed
I was personally attacked exactly at 3 am by gigguk. I wouldnt be surprised if he actually said my name and not Liam xD
I was personally attacked exactly at 3 am by gigguk. I wouldnt be surprised if he actually said my name and not Liam xD
The only good thing was JOJO part 6. Everything was hot garbage.
The way gigguk presents his videos has the ability to make me watch anything. Wasn't even gonna touch sports anime yet he convinced me.
And you already know chatgpt set this script
10:20 Having grown up in an Asian metropolis and then moving to the US, I gotta say the vibes are *quite* different walking out at night
10/10 Himeno truth
Man, looking at the this list it kinda made me realize why Bocchi made the biggest impact for me. It felt like a home. A really comfortable home.  With so many animes with sick action scenes and stunning animation, it's hard to pinpoint which one is the best "anime" as in the anime itself as the medium. Hell, even if we tried to pick it based on the content it has, a lot of them have load of content and not simply just cool-looking animation. It's like going through all these 5* restaurant and your tongue got numb from all the delicious course.  And then you want to take a break, maybe picking some junk-food isekai but they're now so saturated none of them satisfied your need. Then you realized, home made meal is the best meal when you need it.
King Gigguk makes another masterpiece annual recap.
Hoe lee fukin shit, this list was amazing, but what's more amazing, is that this video is 30 mins long and I didn't feel like it was 30 minutes, the way you describe anime and how you narrate your own point of view is so intriguing that the 30 minutes felt like 10 mins. You did such a great job!
Seeing made in abyss at #1 made me so happy. Simply amazing
About a s3 Mob. It's a bit sad, that they are not included in S3 a special, about a man with a 131 spirit level.
Summertime Render's subtitles trying too hard to put an accent into text was what made it hard to watch.
Damn, it is actually 3 AM right now.. XD
It's literally 3AM as I'm watching this, please get out from under my bed, I swear I'm not gonna hurt you.
amazing vid! keep up the good works
idk how to feel about made in abyss. that's it, i'm just...
Chainsaw man is the akame ga kill of the generation
dope
Chainsaw Man
Funny how this is almost the only channel for me where I press the like button before I even watched the whole video.
"Gay girls, innit?" And goddamn do I love it.  Also fuck that montage of action intercut with the behind the scenes of "The Witch from Mercury"s orchestration. CHILLS.
how the fuck does he know that it is literally 3 am while i am watching this god damn it gigguk. Putting that aside great year great video like allways you just put me in a stat of trance with your videos! Thank you
fuck it's 3:09 am in Belgium and Gigguk tells me to go to sleep and i still have 20 minutes left in the video
Didn't expect MIA s2 as no.1, BUT I am very happy. Made In Abyss was that anime everyone warned me about being hella crazy, and I was like it'll be fine, but I wasn't fine when I watched it. Season 2 was something that I wish I can experience again. The emotions were so crazy
Personally for me but let's be for real for the community as a whole we all know Garnt's taste can be ass whenever it comes to other mediums or straight up just his actual taste buds he's like the polar opposite of Erina's God Tongue but hey when it comes to the weeb shit damn does my boi have an immaculate taste for it always has and even certain aspects of the shows he dislikes always come with valid criticisms and you can tell they're 💯% honest that's what makes you wanna keep listening because of the passion THE ANIME ZONE HIMSELF shows thanks again Garnt‼️ for these peak reviews honestly masterpieces in themselves alongside all the great anime mentioned in this past year like DAMN 2022 WAS STACKED!!! 🔥
I felt uncomfortable when you mentioned 3am and it is 3:09 now 0_0
A little bummed out that Gigguk didn't mention Fuuto Pi. But I'm happy Chainsaw Man and Spy x Family made it on the list
10:07 .. i feel extremely called out, yeh its 3am for me
I called top 5,4,3,2 and I haven't started Made in Abyss, so excited to binged it now.
I was expecting to see eminence of shadow in the first half of the video tbh
Made in abyss #1
Is noone talking about Mark fucking Goldbridge in the video 🤣🤣
huge W for Made in Abyss
My dad is from Argentina, so we were all pretty excited watching Argentina win against France. Didn't expect it to be brought up here though lol!
For about 75% of this video I had GooseBumps. Each one of the Amazing stories, ideas, animations, feelings related to each all put together in this stellar composition of a video. This Man Garnt is a True master of his craft. ......God Motha Fuking DAYUMMM!
Gigguk reminded me how beautiful 2022 was even though it is the shittest year for me irl. Anime in 2022 carried me through this year and this is the love letter i just needed to express my feelings and experience.
"Gay girls init" -Grant, 2023  Absolutely based king
... it was 3:04am when he mentioned "wht are you doing up at 3am watching YT video" bro get out of my house (head as well)... aight, immma continue watching the video now
where evangelion 3.1 You (lied) to us?
This got multiple laughs out of me. A couple I have yet to watch to add to my watch list. Thanks :)
It was so hard to find a word or even a phrase to say exactly how made in abyss makes you feel and the best one I could think of was "heavy." It's a beautiful sadness mixed with hope and exploration not matched by anything else in the industry
I swear man every time I watch one of your videos I fall in love with this medium all over again
Such an amazing year
Always look forward to these year round ups from you Garnt your passion for the medium is second to none and always shines through in your script writing the bants the rants the heartfelt words that you use which would be cringe if anyone else said them just wanna show some appreciation for what you've done for the community keep it up king much love to ya and all the nakama out there!!! ❤️
@10:20 I LOLed.  I sighed.  Why the f*** you gotta bring me back to reality Gigguk!?
Bocchi and summertime rendering took my personal favorites this year. Made in abyss deserves to have that top spot.  Respect  for making such quality content for us for almost 15 years. Every detail and reasoning given with such mix of finesse and variety of fun yet filled with heartfelt emotions which hits on a personal note. Ty Garnt.
What the f*ck . . . Where's Arcane ? Wait a minute . . .
I was watching the ranking and when it reached to the top I was asking myself "Wait what show can be on top?"   I think my brain had erased the second season of Made in Abyss because of the trauma. Holy shit, some episodes left me almost drenched in sweat from the tension and panic.
I haven't been watching Attack on Titan since season 2, but I thought it was going to be over after an anime called "Attack on Titan Final Season." Apparently what logically follows after Attack on Titan Final Season is "Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2."   I really don't like this half season trend that seems to be happening in anime.
Made in abyss on top 1 really surprise me.
Best NEW anime 1. Lycoris Recoil 2. Summer Time Renderer 3. Gundam of Mercury 4. Ao Ashi 5. Bochi the rock 6. Chainsaw Man  Have not watch cyberpunk
The Eminence in Shadow is missing watched the hole Video waiting on it. Sadly you didnt mention it!
No Danmachi nod?  Yes it’s an ongoing series and I’m the season is still ongoing in 2023 but my god that first half was spectacular.
How did he know it was exactly 3am here?
Idk why I was expecting Bleach at number 1 when you already mentioned it at the start so MADE IN ABYSS WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE ABSOLUTE GOATED SHOW!!! 😭🐐
BRUH IT'S 3:00 AM, how did you know?
Bro it literally is 3 am lmao 10:05
Where was bleach :(
When Gigguk said "come on, it is 3 am we are at degen hours now"... I stopped the video, looked at the clock and saw 02:58...
24:25 - Finally a "Best Anime of 2022" list that recognizes my boy and his show among the top tier. Agree with everything you said 💯℅. It was perfect way to end the show. 🙌
I've finally found the fitgirl movie
Kaguya being in the list at all made me so happy, but Made in Abyss becoming number one and Gigguk's words about it is beyond deserved. No words can describe MiA, but Garnt was close there.
The title change was perfect 👌🏼
i give up on watching made in abyss, its so painful to watch
Dang it, he totally nailed it that I was watching this at 3am. At least my name is not Liam xd
Love the list .. still thinking  romantic killer should be on the list .. for all the Romcom  fans
And once again Gigguk convinces me to watch every single anime on his list
As yes, 2022: cyber punk, chainsaw man… my favorite anime genre: Emotional Damage….
great video grant !
I hated Made in Abyss.  The body horror and weird stuff was just way too gross.
It is 3 am... Man just insulted my existance
Euclid not Euslid
Last year was just an insane year of anime, before 2022 it had been like 6 years since i was this into anime.
Oh joy... two soccer anime no one likes.
lol... seeing Goldbridge in Gigguk video is wild af...
Call of the night deserves a higher rank but other wise called it for best of 2022
Great video!
Summertime Rendering was amazing from beginning to end.  It easily was one of my favorite shows of all year. It was definitely my most recommended to my friends.
BOCCHI THE ROCK LETS GOOOOO
Summertime Rendering best for me
kong ming and bocchi the rock my god tier
Reincarnated as a sword was actually good though, but yes it is one of those shows with a unique premise (like Kongming)
My best girl hasn't shown up yet. So.... 2023 yeah
Jesus christ, I WILL comment everytime someone says Netflix affected jojo hype.  No it fucking didn't. If you're less hype, it's because you're depressed. Netflix allowed jojo to release in every language simultaneously, and weekly jojo pacing is fucking GARBAGE. The final fight to Jojo part 3-6 is 8 episodes, minimum. Half the viewers would have let the episodes build up to binge anyway, and then risk getting spoiled, which was a problem with part 5. Netflix was fucking good for jojo, and I hope they get part 7.  Everyone who says otherwise needs to wake the fuck up.
Learning that Garnt watches most of this is 1.5 or 2.0x :(
Being able to witness the end of the main JoJo series was such a bittersweet moment.. I am so excited for the future of the anime
“Gay girls innit”  Gigguk 2023
Made in Abyss deserves the top spot. The studio really nailed it when they adopted the manga into an anime.
I still haven’t finished made in abyss 2 yet. I’m about half way through and man did it fuck me up.
MF made me cry multiple times in a single yt video
God bless u Garnt. You too damn funny bro
Just finished made in abyss season 1 and gigguk puts the second season as his nr 1 anime of 2022. Need to watch and come back to know what he has to say about it.
Gigguk's writing is gold.
Would only change a few numbers. Very based list.
If this took Gigguk an especially long time to make, at least for winter 2023 season video all he has to do is say "Isekai" like a hundred times on camera.
Mob Psycho definitely deserved season 3 and it was refreshing to see a happy ending.
Godlike video garnt wish bleach was on it but 10/10 vid might watch again
Sosuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
I can't believe you've seriously put Made in Abyss as the Top 1 anime, let alone on this list at all.
The best thing to happen to me in 2022 was discovering Made in Abyss. I have heard so many good things about it from the community but I've never had the time to actually watch it. One time, I had to travel for 3 days on a bus, I thought to myself that this is the perfect time to watch Made in Abyss and from the very first episode alone, I knew it was gonna be a good show. Amazing soundtrack, great sound design, interesting characters with an amazing unexplored world to boot. I had to wear the hood on my hoodie at all times when I watched the movie just to hide the absolute waterfall of tears running down my face. Season 2 started and ended amazingly.  Made in Abyss has become one of if not my my most favorite anime. If someone reading this comment hasn't watched Made in Abyss, and is looking for an anime with a great story and amazing world-building, I highly highly highly recommend it. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
OMG THANK YOU FOR PUTTING MADE IN ABYSS AT #1 I LOVE THE SHOW IT IS SO UNDERRATED
Just heard the song for number 1 and just started balling
Trash Taste
Am I the only one that doesn’t really like spy x family
Summertime Rendering was not good. I'm happy if you enjoyed it but for me, it started well and progressively got more and more crap. Such wasted potential.
The first few notes of number 1 made my eyes start watering as the whole season flashed before my eyes.
The way you edited 27:28 almost made me cry
Can anime get even more ridiculously dumb and lame just to squeeze in more fan pondering. Yes, yes it can and this is only the tip of the dickburger. Holly crap if this is the best anime list for the year, I'm not watching anime this year either. I just want one, one single series that makes at least a handful amount of sense instead of going through a checklist of what they think people want to see or at least willing to pay for to see, and create a blob of vomit in the process.
Tbf Spy multiplied by family is a good period piece
Made in abyss s2 was a banger masterpiece , the music and story were phenomenal
It's funny you used angry rant man 🤣
If every year is gonna be like 2022, then I'm not complaining
I've been saying that season 2 was gonna be filled with the most eldritch, lovecraftian horror in Anime and I can't believe I was correct.
Made in abyss ost hits hard
*Gey girls innit* 🗿
When garnt said no body cares about sound design that made me sad because holy shit sound design is such an important part of any media and good sound design is orgasmic
10:00 GOD DAMN IT IT REALLY IS 3AM HOW DID HE KNOW?!?!?!
congratulations!
Kaguya sama as well one of first romance animes i watched and enjoyed so much hype from episode to episode without even realising how fun it was.
Where is attack on Titan
absolutely amazing as alaways just finished watching with wife
1 month in to the new year GOTTA LOVE GIGGUKS SCHEDULE👍
man, his description of made in abyss resonated so much with me, it was so emotionally powerful and moving it's something that you don't forget. It's a strange feeling, it's not a feels-good anime or a really action-packed epic with fight scenes, but the philosophy and messages that are so beautiful and moving in the way it happens. The characters get what they want, but not exactly how they imagined it. And in the end, they end up losing everything they thought they wanted but gained something they never thought they wanted
I think Fallout 76 still beats out Cyberpunk for being most fucked up upon release. Love the list though
Made in the abyss is bloodborne the anime but with more wow
I'm gonna say it! SpyxFamily is mid. There I did it and you can't do a thing about it!
I was really worried Birdie Wing was going to fly completely under the radar. Glad it made the list
This peak writing.
Not enough gay girls/10
Sooooo........Winter anime 2023 in a nutshell when?
You're the reason that I've got to watch other animes aside from my favourite genres because your in depth approach to it that makes me want to watch and appreciate it. Thank Gigguk from your common fan 👍
These transitions were CLEAN, thanks for the banger video :D
my problem with demon slayer is its just spectacle and theres almost nothing underneath. i'll watch it, but it's not gonna take up any space in my brain cause there's nothing to think about
Yuri literally ruined so many anime
Man i love this videos. “Emotional damage “ had me dying 😂
not me zoning out only to hear garnt say my name and give me a heart attack
Here again to work of the list  and watch everything  on it
Garnt I love you. But... Cyberpunk? Good Style, animation and music are enough? What about bad plot and characters? Really over hype title. Bocchi the rock is ❣️💋
i love gigguks videos i actually started watching call of the night when he made the first video on it about the manga and was so hapy when it was getting an anime, this video is so good and i really missed his vidoes i can't wait for more
yep, Made in Peak!
How to make an anime popular? Garnt: Get a girl in it
I absolutely loved Summer time rendering it was a anime i randomly click on and watch until the end whole 25 episodes or so definitely recommend
Kinda sad that no Isekai is on there... Especially the eminence in shadow is like the best Isekai I saw since jobless reincarnation. This is the kind of stupid over the top comedy I need in my isekai
My best 2022 and still on going Eminence in the shadow
Gigguk forgot Love Live! Superstar!😂😅😂😅
Yea, well you know Netflix totally killed the season when Stone Ocean aint even here because everyone forgot about it :/
🔥❤️ you do it again gigguk's :) can't wait for the next video
This year is going to be fun for me, Oshi No Ko, One Punch Man S3, and please for the love of god, Uzumaki better be releasing this year to put the horror genre in the spotlight this time. I'm looking forward to what else comes out in 2023!
That chainsaw man waifu segment was hilarious my sides
Gonna be blunt, what promise did Chainsaw Man not deliver on? I am not a fan of the series and I can firmly say that no show in the past 10+ years did more in its first 12ep season than this did.  If you wanted more, I honestly question your expectations.
Good video but I'm going to have to disagree simply because One Piece didn't get first place and didn't even make into the list. I'm sorry but please take my advice and add One Piece (The best anime ever created) to next years video.
Didn't expect Mark goldbridge and Danny in a gigguk video
Damn Fuuto Tantei Didn't Make it top 17
I like the ranking but where is bleach 🤨
BIRDIE WING SOLOS FICTION!!!
So some girl golf anime > Aot,Jojo,Bleach,Mha????
LEZZZ GOOOOOO!!!! Made in Abyss is my favorite show of all time. I got so hyped when I heard Old Stories playing for #1.    BTW the song sauce for Made In Abyss:  27:45- "Old Stories" 28:00-  "Reg & his Interference Unit" 28:38- "Gravity" All by Kevin Penkin
I am same generation of fans as Garnt. I watched a lot in my teenage years. Then did grind every season to find any good show that coming out.  But year by year more and more shows comes out in season. More and more real life takes my own time but by bit. I could give up watching if there was no this kind  compilation video.  Garnt, Thank you for do grind for me and present best shows in pleasable form.
I hate the fact that Garnt was right about me watching this at 3 AM
It's honestly a crime that Akebi and 86 didn't make your list, but some certain other titles did. Akebi had better animation than Demon Slayer and 86 was a better mecha show than Witch From Mercury (which, let's face it - only had 2 standout episodes despite leaving us massively hyped for season 2)  Oh, and 3 sports anime but no Akiba Maid War? Wtf man.
10:14 jumped so FUCKING hard.
15:48. A missed opportunity to put Todo's face in there.
Damn you had the "just read the manga" video taken down? Dammit
I literally was just playing metal gear solid v 😂
I can imagine people in the comments just typing "Where Attack On Titan?"
the smash fans didn't deserve this LMAOOOOOOOOOo
Imagine being the Liam watching this at 3 am rn... I know it's 3 am but I'm not Liam.
Can confirm cyberpunk 2077 the game is still beyond fucked lol
Although I'm sad bleach wasn't on there, I'm happy that others like kongming were there.
I swear to god, i arrive at the call of the night part. And guess what time it is😂
As soon as i heard old stories i nearly cried
Congratulations on the marriage
Nothing brings me more joy than seeing Made In Abyss for atleast 2 seconds.  i'll hold those 2 seconds for a moment  Edit: NVM MADE IN ABYSS SEASON 2 IS IN NUMBER 1 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Made in abyss season 2 is really one of those pieces of fiction that makes you feel emotions you can't express with words and at the end of the journey you can't really express what you felt about it. One is only grateful for watching such an incredible story
YOOOOO MACROSS INTRO IS  LIT
Anime 2022 - the year of "get girls in it"
The made in abyss mangaka is almost certainly a pedophile. Take one look at his pixiv favourites.
This is why you are the biggest anime youtuber Garnt. Nothing beats your content
What's the music at 24:26?
Nice shoutouts to Birdie Wing and Aoashi! Don't agree on 1 and 2 though
W#f it's actually 3am
Made in abyss was truly the anime of the year, although it was really hard to choose between so many good anime, as I went on a recap I knew it was between bocchi, kaguya, mob and made in abyss, and either of them winning wouldve made complete sense.
WOOT MADE IN ABYSS #1 BABY!!!!!
Fantastic video son fun all the way as only gigguk knows •́  ‿ ,•̀  I'm So happy Made in abyss gets the love ir deserves My favourite manga/anime absolutly love it.  Also great selection and order overall
Great video! So happy Made in Abyss not only made the list but was also at #1
Gigguk’s videos always make me emotional. The videos Are so beautifully made it’s crazy.
2022 was the gay anime girl year
my most anticipated video in youtube on 2023, i really enjoyed that, still waiting for a time when i'll watch made in abyss because i'm not ready
Me wondering where bleach is:
oh My GOD! GIGGUK PUT MADE IN ABYSS AT NO 1! I FKING LOVE YOU!
I remember reading SpyXFamily after a YouTuber recommending it way before the anime and loving it but also dropping it after Anya got to school
You really do make some of the best content on YouTube, Garnt. I'm so glad I get to watch you talk about anime of all things.
amazing
You know the video is gonna be a banger when he starts it of like that.
what anime is 14?
its Finally here I thought you'd never drop it 🔥🔥🔥
Gigguks has such a was with words, he managed to encapsulate the series so perfectly.
Ngl I'm honestly surprised with the top 5, not because of what the shows were, but the ordering. Garnt talked a lot about cyberpunk during his other stream so I was expecting to be 2nd or 1st but honestly they were all so deserving of the top spot that I'm pretty satisfied with the list as a whole.  Glad With from Mercury is so high, it gave us one of the more unique takes on gundam with it somehow being a thriller mystery where you're trying to figure out what happened between the prologue and main show while still gripping you with its story, action, music and fucking beautiful 2D mech fights. Hope 2nd part doesn't drop the ball....
I was completely floored by Cyberpunk Edgerunners, it is probably my favorite anime of 2022.  It was so good, and so Trigger.
7:56 100% Agree.
Gay girls in it
Song: Venus line   What we heard: Pen*s life
Where are the Isekai?
I was hyped for witch of mercury but it was to much school anime. Does it get better? Summer time render I just watched through other means cause Disney isn't getting my money. They have ruined to many franchises. But a solid year for sure.
this tierlist is invalid why the fuck is kaguya 6th
I am indeed watching this at 3 am. And my name is Thomas... Grant!
Where’s puss in boots???
Bleach should 100% be at least ON this list if not near the top. I know Gigguk doesn't personally like bleach but even if you don't, you have to admit it was as good or better than at least half the shows listed. Credit where credit is due: Bleach had tons of issues before, and almost none of those were present in this new season of the show.
Gotta say another anime that surprised me the most was Romantic Killer, just simple fun but had a heck of a twist in it, add a eurobeat ED and im watching every second of it. Also that transition from mob to 1 was well done :P
I think eminence in shadow deserved a mention. Though the list is 9/10 great.
I still can't get over the bloody end of W.F.M. The power of Brainwashing...
I still can't get over the bloody end of W.F.M. The power of Brainwashing...
10:05 Yes, it is actually 3 am
was really hopping for an "I am Atomic"
He says he doesn’t like cute girls doing cute staff but he… actually put those series on his favorites always. Just accept it
Are we not gonna talk about how bleach tybw had one of the best fights of all of 2022
The memes man 😂
world trigger, when?  non-esports esports isekai anime
There's an upcoming Genshin Impact anime adaptation is coming soon.
Made in Abyss season 2 is a real pain in the ass to watch right now. Doesn't seem to be on any legitimate platforms.
My man really said he doesn't like anime girls doing anime things anime
Ever since his anime in 2020 video. His year end list becomes better and more emotional. How does he do it? Damn.
So glad about no 1 I love it.
Wut... bleach...?..
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO I laughed and cried many times during it and it made me realize again HOW MUCH I REALLY LOVE anime. Thank you so so much for making this
If I had to find an ambassador to aliens for anime, its this guy
Yo for real!  Shoutout to the World Cup for being the best sports anime this year. 😂
But but what about bleach and eminence?
New Bleach is meh.
Made in abyss has been my favorite anime for years. However, I still haven't watched the second season yet because...I'm scared. I need to emotionally prepare myself. I think it's about time I bite the bullet and watch it lol.
No lie gigguk is my favorite anime content creator
The way you do your scripting is insane I wish u could honestly put videos like this everyday cuzz my god I could be having the worst day imaginable and your videos easily change that keep up the work mate
I am one of the few haters for Spy x Family
himeno fans...
Where's BLEACH???
Don't know what was happening in Japan but Disney+ emailed me about their anime offerings like once a week all fucking year lol.
I don't want to be the guy that says "why isn't my favorite on the list!" so instead I'll just say everyone, go watch To Your Eternity. Season 2 is even more of a masterpiece than the first season and it's the only show that's made me gasp out loud.
22:21 Seeing this clip of them playing is what made me watch Bocchi. I have 0 regrets
kaguya and mob >>>>>>> everything else this year
Gaygirlsinnit?
Only watched 80% of these animes but still so entertaining to watch
26:30 what's the song playing in the background??
The gundam bit gave me goosebumps
I love how randomly beautiful PA works work has been this past year
27:00 Did he just pronounce "non-euclidian" as "non-eusidian"?
Moar gay girls please!
Almost the exact same top 5 list for me, except Bocchi which I haven't seen yet. Fantastic summary for 2022, honestly it felt like it was the best year for anime in recent memory
Macross 82-99 in the intro??? FUCK YEAH
While my name isn´t Liam I did feel very called out sitting here at not far from 3 AM and watching this video.
gay girls innit
Gigguk, pleasssseeeeeee, music. You use great music in these videos, just give us a link to the music you used. 28:57, the music here is hauntingly beautiful, and I am going to waste 30 minutes to 3 days trying to find it because it is worth it, but man, just give it to us. it is gravity kevin penkin ft arnór dan btw, for those looking
Meaning of Bish to me, has a lot of similarities to ergo proxy and violet Evergarden
Made in Abyss hits different…
I actually can't believe Eminence in Shadow didn't make this list. It's Gigguk!
I got a lot to catch up with my guy
I deadass cried when I saw mob growing up 😭
Peak video 👏🏻👏🏻
only liam was wrong man
I prefer calling it Spy by family, hunter by hunter and High School Double-Deez
Ya know that eminem joke woulda hit much harder if he didn't already drop "killshot" the answer diss track to Machine Gun Kelly's diss track. I say this cos MGK used to make rap music, he no longer participates in the genre.
Not even a Mention of Bleach!!
Man, I live just to get these vids every year. Thank you.
2022 has been the best year in anime history with so many bangers.
Song at 29:00?
Sad that ranking of kings didn't even get honorable mention
gigguk always feels like some news company of anime and i tend to forget its a youtuber because of the quility of his vids are so top notch its difficult to find anything like it
Bro where's Bleach
10:09 WTF IT WAS EXACTLY 3 AM FOR ME
This list was straight fire
this was a blast to watch, awesome work.
When the world needs him the most. He is back!
It truly was a year of anime
IMO 2022 for anime was one of the best for a few years. Yes, even comparing to previous years. We have SO many shows whose hype went out of the anime community. Chainsaw Man, Cyberpunk. Bocchi, Spy x Family, Demon Slayers. People out of the community know about them and love them. Isn't it a sign that this yearm indeed, is the best for Anime? And also, holy cow, a lot of 2022 shows ended up in top 100 on MAL. That's crazy, yaknow
I’m salty I can’t be mad at this list cause bleach ain’t in it
YES THANKS FOR DOING THIS VIDEO
"None of it was because of some simple violence or gore but ideas and imagery that disturbed me to my core" -Gigguk with some bars
great year wrap up, need to add witch of mercury to my list because that music is banging
“Gay girls innit”
Welcome to the marriage club
2 sentences into number 14, then moves on to 13 & 12. Standing ovation, top teir commentary
didnt include ranking of kings 🥺
Can I get sauce for that Koming movie clip? Obviously not gonna be edited like that, but it was hilarious
Liams shaking rn
Loved the editing, the transitions between one anime to the other, made me hyped every time, whether I'd seen the show before or not. It alongside Garnt's insights, made this a joy from beginning to end. Thank you.
Spy x Family is so overrated, bad script, boring characters. Bleach not there? Ranking of Kings? 😂
Thanks for giving MiA S2 the promotion it deserves!! It's out of this world.
Just don't care for bocchi as a character. She's painful to watch but the gags all make up for it.
Made in Abyss was really too good. I feel sorry for people that cant handle that type of anime. I understand them, but at the same time, they are really losing on such an incredible emotional roller coaster...
I'm so glad you put made in absys at the top
I'm really glad you put made in abyss season 2 as your number 1. It was also my favorite. I was just thinking the other day about how made in abyss makes you feel an indescribable feeling, something you brought up in the video.
Wow.. and I’m out here still reading the rent a girlfriend manga
2022 is probably one of the best years for anime I have ever seen. There is at least one amazing show from almost every genre and on top of that, the most 10/10s I've given out in a single year.  And if that wasn't enough, this year had some fantastic anime announcements especially stuff which I personally wanted so badly to have a sequel that I got too excited when they happened. 😁
Thank your for giving the masterpiece aka Made in Abyss the number one spot, sosu
Been looking forward to this all year, and you did not disappoint! Awesome picks, looks like there are a couple I need to revisit 😅
I’ve bought chainsaw man manga part 1 twice I am the one who raised this anime NEED SEASON 2NOW!!
did not expect Goldbridge and Danny Aarons in a Gigguk anime recap but I'm here for it
10:08 im literally watching it at 3 am
8:05 true 8:08 dream on
While I do think Bocchi should be #1, otherwise this list is incredibly based
Summer Time Rendering did a lot of fun and interesting stuff with the time loop formula that I hadn't seen before, highly recommend as a hidden gem yeah.
goated channel 😤
bocchi the rock: *runs in and drops one of the hardest animes of the year, refuses to elaborate
Made in abyss fell off hard on season 2 RIP
And Danny
All was good while I was watching this video until Old Stories started playing and Garnt started talking about Made in Abyss S2
25:54 OK that was a pretty sick transition.
Goldbridge in a gigguk video worlds have collided
Maybe ill give mob psycho another try
I was literally watching this at 3 am and my name is Liam 😂😂😂 I’ve never been more called out in my life
I'm sorry gigguk, but it's very simple really. Is made in abyss close enough to monogatari feels? I'm pretty skeptical as to if anything can come even close to the forceful tearfulness of monogatari. I'm not into moe chibi stuff, but if you actually do recommend it, fuck it, you've been molded by degeneracy, I'll trust you. Also, damn boy, your editing is quite epic, thoroughl enjoyed the video from an artistic perspective of continuity.
10:07 The best part is Gigguk actually premieres this at 3AM my time
Very happy that cyberpunk edgerunners got 3rd. Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it coming or at least I never did. I discovered it through moist kritikal and goddamn that was too short man.
I love made in abyss
Thanks so much for the hardwork you put into these. Beyond my favourite videos and always has me looking forward to a new year.
2:10 killed me bruh 💀
I think number one was a great choice. For me, my anime of the year was close call between that and number four.
-"Safe, marketable, action shows" -Bo-Bo-Bo's in the background  Ummmmm...idk about that one
11:08 Summer Time Rendering is also on Hulu.
I love the video keep up the amazing work
I WILL NOW SAY TO MAKE ANY SHOW OR GAME BETTER IS GAY GIRLS YEP THAT IS NOW A THING
Akebi-chan gives you a sense of sin, as if you are peeping at the life of 13-year-olds...
How did you know it was 3am :O
if we only include shows that I didn't already have my foot in the door for, I came out of this with only 5 additions to my list of stuff to watch. If we include stuff I was already in to (and the one show I watched last year) it comes up to 10 of 17 that I wanna believe I will watch  The new: Ya Boy Kongming Call of the Night Summer Time Rendering Bocchi the Rock Love is War (I've been meaning to watch it for years, but I haven't started so it makes the list)  The Old: Demon Slayer S2 Spy x Family (manga reader) Mob Psycho S3 Made in Abyss S2  The Watched: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (twice)
where tf is to your eternity and ranking of kings
MADE IN ABYSS TOP 1 LESSSSGOOOOOOO!!!
I told everyone I know made in abyss was going to be anime of the year, no one seemed to agree or even want to give it a chance
Love your videos man.  I am always looking forwards to the next one.
I loved _My Dress-Up Darling, Lycoris Recoil,_ and _Spy x Family._ And I'm currently making my way through _Bocchi the Rock_ and _Kaguya-sama_ is next. I'm sad that _Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War_ didn't make it onto your list.  Edit: _Jobless Reincarnation_ was on here but I removed it.
Bonkers that there’s no Bleach here. Legit one of the best comebacks in anime and was incredible from start to finish.
eminence in shadow
Hey Gigguk you must have forgotten that the second season of Rent-A-Girlfriend aired last year.
1 minute and I realise why I’ve been subscribed for years.
One Piece  Naruto and Boruto  Bleach  Are gonna go CRAZY this year Big 3 at its greatness! And I'm always a sucker for Shounen and action for the rest of my life! And so are you guys
Sees #14... Garnt being a Tsundere, as always... XD
Quite sad Eminence in shadow isn't on here but it would definitly be on honourable mentions  😀(Help me)
Soccer. It's pronounced soc·cer Garnt, ya bloody twit.
Birdie Wing turned out to be the anime I became the most invested in and I can't wait for season 2 (mainly to see if a comment on Crunchyroll is correct about Eve and Aoi. I'm hoping it isn't, as I will riot if it is true, lo.  But the evidence towards its credibility is pretty huge). I don't often fall head over heels for an anime, but when I do, I kind of fall hard, and Birdie Wing was that anime for me this year.   In terms of igniting old flames, Tiger and  Bunny got a season 2! I thought the bitter-sweet ending of season 1 was a good place to end the whole show, but oh my god...shit got even more serious! New characters and stories were also added that weren't just shoe-horned in. Love that they took the first few episodes to actually shine a light on them, so they didn't just feel tacked on to the cast. I still love the original characters the most, but Golden Ryan (who was actually introduced in a movie) had probably my favorite character arc in a while. By the end of season 2, I think he ended up being one of my favorites. I'd be here all day talking about T&B, but it is without a doubt one of my favorite shows and I'm happy it still has more to give.
Where are the isekais🤣
Wtf... 10.15  and its 1 am not 3
Glad Gigguk gave Made in Abyss the attention it needed
that description of made in abyss was actually perfect.  i personally would not be able to describe it.
Why am i not surprised Bleach isn't here lol
Made in Abyss lost too many points for its infatuation with piss puke and shit with me.
You know it's been a good year for anime, when you can go to each season of 2022, and there's at least 3 bangers in each one. I feel like I got overwhelmed by the titles released in Fall 2022, that I forgot about all the other anime I'd watched in the past year, and anything that I was planning to watch was thrown into the wide expanse known as the "Plan To Watch" list.  Also I found a pretty cool video about the accuracy of Shimokitazawa if anyone else is interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO2ZimwhaHw (Like, who copies a singular brick?)
2022 was just gay girls all the way down wasn't it?
This is why I've been watching dude since years ago the most for anime. Awesome
Gay girls being the next trend is something im so for
We need an anime movie about the America v Iran game
Listing the time stamps with sr numbers  instead of the title is BuzzFeed like.
Perfect list
The power comment about smash brothers hurts cause my ex was super gross and I am currently playing smash bros
Imagine if Garnt describe the bread like he describe anime
Lycoris too low. Needed to be 1.
Oh my god I almost cried when the beat dropped for your Made In Abyss review. Now I definitely need to watch the show 😭😭😭
Summer Time Rendering's on Hulu now, too. Pretty epic.
Quite surprised not seeing bleach or AOT in here
Borf
I really want to see gigguk do a review on steins gate cuz it’s so underrated 💀
Darkness and gun devil are going to break the internet...
Gay girls innit
Congrats mate, each iteration is better than the last, the work shows
19:25 made me screaming bruh
dang not going to lie almost cried just hearing the music of made in abyss lol. honestly man i don't know if ready for season 3. i do feel kind of weird because i've gone through 2 seasons and the movies and i actually haven't cried yet but i'm always on the edge of doing it. i wonder what it would mean i someone reach the end of this show without crying.
I can't be the only one that wants Sydney to do a dub for Marin now, right?
I absolutely disagree on number 1. Made in Abyss S2 was a dumpster fire. It was a good story but nothing happened... Ep1 and Ep12 were EXACTLY THE SAME. Nothing changed. Everything the season gave us was stripped away in the last episode.   It. Was. Shit.
A sleeper hit that almost no one talks about from last year is Reincarnated as a Sword. It's not super deep, it's got a pretty generic isekai setting but the music, character, animation and the wholesome dynamic between Fran and Teacher is amazing. It's the only anime I've recommended to like 6 people and they all watched and loved it.
I loved this video, but I do miss when you shouted all the anime at the end of every year of anime video like ur previous ones, Like "More Kaguya, More this more that. Was pretty funny
Cyberpunk edge runners was so good🤯🤯
I'm surprised when talking about Made in Abyss he didn't mention Kevin
Ranking of Kings should have been on the list :) But other than that it was a solid list
Where's ousama ranking (ranking of kings)
don't speak of this world cup near costarricans
not liam but you got me good. 1:10 AM in europe.
Bro put Edgerunners 3rd 💀💀 Legit best anime 2022 no cap.
i highly anticipate when the viewer analytics to come out for this video viewer retention drops massively when you start talking about actual football...can we stop pretending its nearly as interesting as the shows?
I don't think mob psycho would make my list, didn't do anything we didn't already know they could, was just overall worse than previous seasons. Summertime Render deserved to be higher, and for the sake of including an actual idol show in the list, Shine post was the one good idol show of 2022.
Bleach was my biggest favorite anime in 2022!
What's the song used in the made in abyss section?
Id say its more like this: Summertime rendering was soo good that disney felt the need to take it for there own. . .
I have barely watched gigguk this year and omg watching him again a nostalgic orgasm or something like that.
Made in abyss best show? Hahaha what a let down.
I wanna know who dysfunctional degenerate is. He's mentioned in so many videos old and new
Nice
Call of the Night was a very surprising hit for me. Soo much I've caught up with the manga even. I didn't even know this existed till the anime. And I love it
Good video but hard disagree with the rankings. Like no MHA and Bleach ? And Spy x Family above Demon Slayer ? Really bruh ? Also Chainsaw Man didn't meet the hype ? Bruh it definitely did.
It's a shame Gigguk doesn't give SoL more of a chance.  He missed out of The Demon Girl Next Door / Machikado Mazoku and the AMAZING way it dealt with the Post-Madoka magical girl show issue of trying to be darker and edgier by turning the fomula on its head.  Please Gigguk-sama go and watch the two seasons of Machikado Mazoku, Shamiko and Momo do such a great job as character.  Plus Gay Girls innit!
I don't know when but I found myself waiting for the Gigguk's anime of the year video every new year come.
finally some summer time rendering respeck out here.
Amazing work Garnt. Always putting every bit of your soul in your work. All I can say is... Thank you, truly.
I love Birdie Wing and having a penis.
He really did it guys, he got it out before February!
"Not related by blood antics" *Shows a picture of Oreimo* ummm
I didn’t realize how many gay girls were in anime this year. Fuck
Seeing mark Goldbridge in a Gigguk video wasn’t something I was expecting today
By far... One of your best videos so far, great music and impecable execution! Thank you for the content!
Made in abyss broke us into atom..
Excellent video again this year. It really was unexpecdedly and pleasantly a good year for anime, thank you Garnt!
Anime fans need to realise how blessed we are to have this man in our corner hyping up the industry. Peak video gigguk👏
"gay girls, innit?" is something i cant stop saying now, thanks alot garnt
Great list. Fuckin’ nailed it.
Lycoris Recoil just seems like Gunsligner Girls in their teenage years…
Haven't watched Made in abyss heard nothing but good things from it, they did say it will make you feel and it scares me. Like Violet evergarden with the episode about the sick mother that Ep hit harder than a truck because i expirienced that same situation. So watching sad anime's has been a no for me don't want to go back that dark corner. Great video as always. ✌️✌️
Thank you for your incredible rewiev. 11/10 would suffer through again
Gigguk, did you just say Usidian? instead of euclidian?
2022 is probably the most stacked year of anime I've ever seen.
I’m just now realizing how many gay girl anime there were this year
Amazing video! No one does as good as a job as Garnt when it comes to his writing combined with the editing. It feels like a movie. Gotta say blue lock and mob psycho is my favourite from last year but I’m gonna give summertime rendering and made in abyss a shot thanks to this video. Top quality video as always!
17:25 parasocial headass
i don't think i have the same taste in anime as grant because i just watched summertime render and started losing interest around episode 7 (also it's on hulu)
i am deadass watching this at 02:59
Thank you for this, by the end I was tearing up.
"Gay girl innt"
26:09 JAMEL DEBBOUZE DANS UNE VIDÉO DE GIGGUK
Wild video to match a wild year. Holy moly
Curse you Gigguk. I didn’t come here to cry 😢
16:40 yo is that a nazi salute?
To anyone else who immediately vibed hard af at 10:31  the song is Losstime by Creepy nuts
God, the kaguya part really put how I feel about the show into the right words. They do feel like my friends and they are super fun to hang out with, even though they aren't real, which is sad. I miss them when the manga ended and I don't look forward to the anime ending
Honestly Gundam was the biggest surprise to me in 2022. I have never watched Gundam before (only played Federation vs Zeon a decade ago), but in spite of this I felt instantly comfortable with the world. The story was quite decent, the animation was great, the characters were interesting... but then the last episode just smacked me across my face and said that this is where the real show begins. Can't wait for the second half of the season to release.
I'm definitely not a slice of life guy either, but Bocchi the Rock is easily the best show I watched in 2022. I haven't laughed this hard at any show since I was a teenager. The gags are well thought out and hit hard.
2022 was really the year of anime. SPY X FAMILY, Bochi the Rock, AOT, 100... what a year!
8:28 best part of this vid
Better late than never
Thank you for adding Birdie Wings into your list Gigguk! Such an underappreciated anime because GOLF. Fire song, fire anime.
Bro please tell me what that song he used for the ending with made in abyss is called
Incredible, gigguk mentioned pokemon
Ah yes. The one ingredient guaranteed to increase the quality of a show. Gay girls. - Gigguk
Powabros... contemplate the aroma
my introduction to romance was a certain girl with pink hair and red horns that became a spaceship....u know....."DARLING"
Can you do another anime in minutes plz 🥺🥺🥺
honourable mention to akiba maid wars
Song at 28:59 please ?
Cyberpunk Edgerunners was the best anime that 1994 forgot to make.
man made in abyss s2 was shit. I'll never understand the hype for that mess.
THeres one quote from Nazuna in "Call Of The Night" that would end up with me leaving my old job and seeking pastures new. I cant find the exact phrasing unfortunately but the words are along the line of "you won't be able to sleep unless you are satisfied with how you spends your waking hours". That stuck with me, I stopped having issues sleeping after I left that job.
15TH!?!
I refuse to watcy gigguk on my phone, he deserves being seen on TV
The list of names that are most popular are so British it's disgusting
Does anyone know the song at 0:07
Summertime Rendering the most underrated show of last year, thank you for mentioning it
call of the mid but no overlord... L Opinion + Ratio
I’m glad Made in Abyss was in the list and pretty much from watching the series. Wow, just wow. Kevin’s music really made me tear up everytime I hear his work in Made in Abyss.
Super great year in anime. My Dress Up Darling hit well and Lycoris Recoil was a big surprise how good it was. Overall, not much to complain about other than making it hard to pick my favourite for the year
Akiba Maid War ✌
Am i the only one who thinks Spy Family is super overrated? 🙈😆
Angry rantman cameo, my day is complete
You know the list is full of bangers when Demon Slayer is only #9
@glassreflection would be really happy w/ this list
for a moment i thought eminence in shadow was going to be number 1 lol
2022 was an absolute stacked year for trash taste and anime im looking forwards to the future of anime, I’ve never had a year where I spent more time on episodes I’m looking forwards to coming out weekly
Thank you for the video. It's awesome, just one thing... How can Bleach not even be in the top 17!? There is no way it is worse than trashy golf anime!
This brought a whole ton of anime that I hadn't even heard of to my attention. I have some binging to do. Thanks Garnt.
29:00 whats the song pls tell me someone
Mamika got us returning to monke
the only reason Urusei Yatsura ain't here is because it ain't over yet.
Your style of vids are an art in itself
Can we just appreciate the WII sports music then Yu-Gi-Oh references in the very first anime review THAT WAS A GOLF ANIME!
Summer Time Rendering is overrated imo. I dropped it after 5 episodes. It raises a lot of questions, but I don't think it does a good job of making you care about getting answers. Plus the bad guys were right about to win in episode 5, but of course they didn't because plot
For once I've actually watched multiple of these. Haven't really been able to get through most anime in the past couple of years so 3/17 completed is quite an improvement.
Bocchi and cyberpunk were surprisingly good this year not gonna lie.   But fr bocchi is fr like me
The Return of the King, The True Lord of all Anime Youtubers, Isekai Connoisseur. Garnt first of his name, has blessed us with another phenomenal video and one of the best quotes yet...  "Gay girls innit?"
Wait is every video different when it came to 3 am degen hours because he said my name the fuk
A great video, BUT, Isekai Ojisan was better easily better than most of what's on this list.
20:21 most relatable moment. THE FEELS MAN
10:21 he did the funni Reddit gun joke.
Wait is bleach not counted as a 2022 anime? Because that was wayy too good.
15:45 There is no sound in space. Please choose some other example.
This is one of the best Gigguk writing of all time
You can tell that Alain is putting efforts in editing the Gundam part😆  It’s good to have a Gundam anime that can recommend to my friends to watch.
Congratulations on you're marriage
The Mark Goldbridge edit was pure GOLD
what about eminence in shadow!! 🥲
Ya Boy Kongming somehow managed to rank higher for me personally than My Dress Up Darling and Kaguya sama. I don't know how, but it just did.
I didn't like made in abbys s2
BOCCHI THE 🐐 NO 🧢
I love 2022 Anime Gigguk
17:10 That's exactly what Gintama does and why the final few arcs and the movie hit really hard.
Cyberpunk and Chainsaw Man were TOP 5 of anything I’ve ever watched and Chainsaw Man hasn’t shown us shit yet, I haven’t read the manga but holy shit do I want to😭
Gay girls, innit?
Garnt, I know you worked really hard on this one. We appreciate it, you're well spoken as always. I like that you tried to stick to newer shows to be more fair. I agree with the majority of your list. Made In Abyss was AOTY for me as well, it's also one of my all time favorites. The pinnacle of fantasy, some of the best OST to ever be composed for anime. Literally the saddest and most disturbing content I've ever personally seen in anime but I can't help but just be captivated by its mystery and aw inspiring beauty.
Garnt goes giga every video
You think made in abyss is about the curse of the monsters getting worse the further you go down… but no… it’s about how messed up the story gets the further you go down. I thought nothing could get more disturbing than what happened in season 5 with those kids…. But no… it got WAY more disturbing in the 6th layer. Like, what more could they do???
My name isn't Liam but I still felt called out
I was about to come into the comments and moan about Summertime Render being stuck in Japan, but they’ve actually released it in the West. It’s been 6 months but they’re finally actually letting us legally watch it.
My list is mostly the same except for the ones I haven't seen or completed yet. Bocchi the Rock and Call of the Night are at the top for me, because I appreciate nothing more than creatively elevating a stale genre to new levels, or cultivating an immaculate vibe. The thing about Call of the Night is that it spends all this time cultivating this vibe, only to deliberately taint it near the end of the season, and remind you that while the night can be beautiful, dangers lurk in the darkness, and if you want to be the kind of person who can handle those dangers, you have to become something else. It promises that, if there's a season two, whatever comes will be very different, but just as brilliant.   The only things not mentioned here that I'm really high on are Teasing Master Takagi-san s3, The Demon Girl Next Door s2, Romantic Killer, and Do It Yourself, but most of those aren't Gigguk's thing, and I fully recognize those all individually hit for me in a way they may not for everyone. Well, I think Romantic Killer could have had a broader audience if it wasn't on Netflix. I related to it as someone not particularly interested in dating, and it surprised me with strong animation, funny jokes, and an extremely charismatic protagonist voiced to perfection. It did turn a bit dark near the end in a way that I didn't 100% like, though, but it averted any toxic messaging in favor of a really positive, rare message.   Demon Girl Next Door is really slept on, probably because it just looks like a cutesy slice of life with supernatural elements. But it gets surprisingly subversive the deeper it goes, and proves you don't have to be edgy at all to pick apart a genre. The lore is dark as hell if you stop for a moment to think about it, and the show KNOWS that but never rubs it in your face or tries to milk it. It's a fluffy show that acknowledges the existence of darkness and refuses to give the darkness any real foothoold. The sentimental and sweet moments feel more earned because we know the main characters have suffered genuine pain and hardship. and as it goes on it develops a great cast of funny supporting characters. and, I should mention too, it has an ongoing plot that advances slowly but steadily, with major, emotionally affecting revelations, and one genuinely gobsmacking twist that also doubles as one of the funniest jokes in the series. but it's not for everyone and I totally get that only some people are going to be able to get on its wavelength.
I think we need a petition of Joe giving the title Anime Man to Garnt officially
Bro thank you I always wait for video in this channel and I never get disappointed.
What about shikimori San 😭?

Bro drop the hardest anime edit in the beginning and thought we wouldn't notice 💀
As always your script is good af, but. You're telling me that Bleach can't even make it to the top of 17 best anime '22 of your list? Whaats?!! Im waiting you dumb*ss where THE song is came in.  And by the way, How much did Kevin Penkin pays you for Made in Abyss stay on top of the list?
i don't care how beautiful or amazing made in abyss is... jesus christ that show is not for me. Great list though gigguk.
Gigguk should have an award at this point
Didn't think I see mark goldbridge and Danny Aarons in a gigguk vid 😂
in the op of birdie wing i always hear "i got adidas"
27:03 that's an interesting way to pronounce non-Euclidian.
Great video, loved the part about the world cup, even though Japans fortune became my countries misfortune, hoping we get a redemption arc next wc. Really had a blast this year, ever since the start of the Covid Pandemic I' ve gotten more and more back into anime after not watching for almost 10 years and Gigguks videos are pretty good for that, so thank you. Some of my Favorites include: Bocchi, Chainsawman, Spy x Family, Dress up Darling, Demon Slayer, Lycoris Recoil and Paripi Koumei
6:07 do you count MGK?
Where is bleach
I've used Bokksu, box coming next month. Actually really nice! + customer support is awesome ^^
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Made in abyse dose not give a warm hug it is an emotional gut punch one after another lol
Bocchi was definitely the biggest surprise for me this year, as well. Good vid for a good year of anime.
amazing video as always your videos always give me chills and thank you for that <33
I really appreciate your words on Made in Abyss, I've had trouble describing how I've felt about it. It really was a hauntingly beautiful experience that I also never intend to recommend to anyone lol. The rest of your video was also super good, so thank you :)
I can't believe how hype I got hearing the opening notes of "Venus Line."  I loved Birdie Wing and glad it made the list.  That said, Kaguya-sama was my favorite anime of the year.  So, so, so good
How about that other cute girls with guns, Gunslinger Girl(2003)?
This is how I know what to watch, the Gigguk roundup.  But... where was Eminence in Shadow? Is our Isekai Trash Boi now reformed?
So sad to see that demon slayer got to be animated by ufotable, such a mid show, talent wasted, terrible, fuck shonen, overrated crap also gay
25:50 nah that edit was clean
Very surprised about made in abyss in number 1 but it is truely so good. Sozu.
SOSU mvp
Gigguk, your "Best of" videos are a piece of art. Your writing and your humour - it s genius.
Gay girls innit. Cracked me up every time
dam bro, you really gotta give a big thank you to your editors for me
Lol unexpected Goldbridge was class
Garnt saying that Bocci was the funniest anime this year reminds me how British people work.
5:10 my my my i got a panis😂
What’s the song playing at the end of the Gundam section?
Demon Slayer S2 is something else.  The stakes, the consequences, the build-ups and the  pay-offs, it was all handled impeccably and at the same time in insanely spectaclular fashion.  The last 5 episodes featured a series of fights that keeps raising the bar and tension each episode and it blown my mind (as well as breaking the Internet too).  Personally,  Bocchi the Rock is my top 1 for 2022.   It's funny, it's touching, artistic, and above all, inspired and heartfelt. It's a show that can give you bundle of bliss during these hard times.
1:21 if you know, you know.
Man did justice to 2022
Kinda sad to not see Bleach in top17, bcs thats what I enjoyed the most. Hell, it had the task of not only coming back 10yrs after, but also fight a whole anime community full of negative opinions towards it and... OH BOYS IT FUCKING DID.  There was so much pasion and quality in the adaptation, literally amazing.   Honestly, this season was awesome. CSM, SpyxFamily, Bleach, Bocchi, oh man It was so good.
Made in abyss hits DIFFRENT
I'm saving Made in Abyss the same way you're saving FMA: Brotherhood. I know it's gonna be a gut punch, I just don't know when I'll be ready.
Bleach tybw
it must been hard too make a 17 tier list and still have rightfully so not have bleach in it.
What's that sound at 20:00 from?
Thanks for making Made in Abyss rank 1.
Made in Abyss makes me wonder...what was author nim (Akihito Tsukushi) smoking? Good god.... But then again, I gotta see how it ends.
Says a lot about the Crunchyroll awards when 3 of the top 5 of the list is all from fall.
I wondered which series will get the first spot, but no one could beat Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun
As a Liam watching this late at night.. How dare you
what about aot??
10:10 I died🤣
Kinda surprised how much Garnt liked Mob Psycho III when it really wasn't all that much. Imo Edgerunners was the biggest surprise of 2022
I agree with this entire list. Thank you for providing such amazing content Gigguk!
I wish my wife would watch this stuff with me
My takeaway from this video was that 2022 was the year of gay girls innit?
Gay girls innit
I wonder what anime in 2023 has in store for us...   Gay girls innit?
ppl that come to greece for vacaion some times get some good advice from their friends and go o watch a play in "epidavrus",there great actors bring to life ancient greek theatr.when they walk out from a play there they feel like their soul went thru a good wash,the catharsis at he end of those stories have that great of an impact! the same shit happens when you finish watching made in abyss s2,its a "strange" animu that will criple your emotions at some parts but it has the same "cathartic" effect as some greek tragedies.
Where JOJO!????
Wait no bleach or Attack in Titan on the list??? Yeah you can’t be trusted gigguk
Motherfucking Rock
Well I got learn something about myself during this video and that is the sound track to MIA makes me cry, in like 10 seconds flat.
Unironically Kaguya-Sama was my gateway into romance anime. So yeah you called that one right…
Ao Ashi >>> Blue Lock
Amazing video as always! I'll be honest though, I can't help but feel like Mob Psycho is overrated, I found most of the characters one dimensional and irritating, and the good action scenes weren't enough to redeem it in my eyes. Still though, Im looking forward to catching up with the new season of Made in Abyss, I've got no idea how I missed that it was out.
Garnt talking about World Cup, LFG
Nothing like an anime video randomly informing me there's recently been a lot more people with my name born into the world.
Maybe I'm a psychopath  for this opinion, but as a person whose seen every show in your best anime list, Mob Physic was kinda mid
Go to bed Liam. why are you still here
Please someone tell me how Call of the night is worth 2 shits I thought oh this might be cool and it's like fuck its weak as shit
C’mon, how was Classroom of the Elite left out of this?
Spy cross product family is so wholesome
I loved this vid, man. People really are sleeping on Made in abyss. They don’t know how truly a masterpiece it is. And you always give it the attention it deserves. Thanks!
BOCCHI gang RISE
excuse me first of all my name is not Liam, and second it's 5 am
2022 was a great year, Chainsaw Man, SNK, My Dress up Darling, Cyberpunk, Bleach, all were amazing shows.  But I think Yofukashi no Uta will be the one I will mostly remember, it resonated with me so much. When I was in highschool a couple of years ago I was like Yamori, I wasn't enjoying school, and walking alone in my town in the dark night with music and sometimes my dog was the thing I was enjoying the most.  This show captures that feeling perfectly. It's surely not for everyone, it's pretty niche, but if you're someone who like an empty city during the night you're probably gonna like Yofukashi no Uta.
Your best Video yet (somehow) keep it up my favourite degen
How tf do u know its 3 am?????????????????????????? cause its actually 3 am
Petition to call the x in anime titles : multiplied !!!!
we need more anime of kultreeeee
Very good list, but unlike everyone else in the comments I disagree:  MOB IS #1
If there was ever a time you needed something that will inspire you to say "...but even still." Made in Abyss is it. Everything in there is so heart wrenchingly, gut turningly, despairing. Yet somehow you are shown that, despite it all, there is a way forward.  Riko's life motto is clearly "Full send it!" and I am all for it!
Not a year to late, hmm ok. I miss the old Gigguk.
I’m tired of all of America being grouped together bro just say LA
What a great video! My 2 cents about some the entries - go read the manga for Call of the Night. Anime covered sooo little! What follows after is freaking awesome. Disclaimer - it's still on-going! I was ready to dump the anime at episode 7, but the twist changed my mind and I stayed. By the end of it I craved more! So yeah, go jump into manga, you will love it ^_^ Another great entry is Summertime Rendering. It was... incredible! Gripping, tense and beautiful! I got the manga too and I can say that the adaption is extremely close to it, so unless you became a hard-core fan - you can skip it (also, fuck the guys who decided not to make it digital, it's 2022 outside, ffs!). Lycoris Recoil was a hit and a miss... Production-wise it looks very good, but the plot has some ugly holes. But hey, the waifus are top-tier! 😀 Btw, did anyone notice how Gigguk did not even touch the ending of TWoM? Hehe, that one was brutal xD P.S. TOTALLY wasn't expecting the Birdie Wing here! It has its flaws, but I still loved it and waiting eagerly for Season 2 ^_^ P.P.S. Kaguya-Sama manga has recently ended, so it's a great time to jump into it ;-)
It's actually 1:15 am
Оболдеть, безда на первом месте
When the part about kaguya sama being the gateway into romance and other genres I was thinking what is mine, but then I remembered mine was fucking domestic girlfriend. Kill me pls
Hey gigguk did you not like overlord season 4
I’ve been avoiding Bocchi the rock or whatever…. Fking fine I’ll watch an episode or something.
W list, L clorox fans for being salty that their favorite ain't on Gigguks list😂typical Bitchigo behavior
If I can at least try to convey the feeling of Made in Abyss that it at least gave to me...  I have seen a lot of anime. Over 400 anime, and while to some that may not be much by comparison, it's enough for many. I have seen the good, the bad, and the terribly ugly.   I have seen Boku no Pico all the way through, because I felt I needed to see every spectrum of anime, even trash shows like Mars of Destruction, to have a an accurate view of what anime is and every type of anime out there. I sat through it unblinking, hating every second of it, but in the grand scope of things, it was still relatively easy to bear through. I've seen gore, to monsters, from Monster to Galactic Heroes.  When I watched Season 1 of Made in Abyss, it was everything and more than I was (or could be) expecting, and when I finished, I felt like a broken man, one that hadn't felt this utterly torn apart since Clannad, and my soul and ego had been dealt a huge blow. When I saw the movie which connects Season 1 and 2, I wanted to physically bring characters of the show to life and thrash them, because any feeling other than what I was feeling at that moment in time, would've been better.  When I attempted to start Season 2, for the first time in my life (in any aspect of life), I had to stop. I saw what the season could do to me, and I was afraid. There are times when you go through life changing events, I've been through quite a few, highs and lows although more highs, but when I saw what season 2 brought to the table, I stopped, took a breath and said "I'm not ready". I actually felt like if I proceeded with the show, something inside me would snap or break, and I was not ready.  I'm sure one day I'll come back to it, Gigguk's high praise makes me want to finish it right now, but despite every trial I've been through in my entire life, somehow, this anime about a hole and children is the hardest I will have undergone to date.  I sincerely hope everyone watches the show or at least attempts to watch it. It's beautiful, and I love it, but for the same reason I love it so much, I will watch it only once and never come back (unlike countless other favorites I've rewatched dozens of times)  Source: an ordinary anime fan
'We ain't seen nothing yet' - I got goosebumbs because of how right you are.
My Jams last year were Kaguya Sama, Traped in a dateing Sim, Gundam Witch From Mercury, Chainsaw Man, and Bleach TYBW this isn't counting all the old stuff I watched like Yamato 2199
我从未见过如此厚颜无耻之人！
9:22 Greatest anime betrayal of all time, Belgium getting it's ass kicked by Morocco
S Tier Video.
summer time rendering actually made me cry because it was such a good anime there was just such bad anime before that and i was so sad.
I have learned that gay girls make everything wayy better 👍
Kaguya s3 and Mob were def my favorites for the year, but anything in the top 6, like Gigguk said could've easily taken number 1. Even then, even outside of this list, there are still a ton of good shows this year. This definitely will be seen as one of the best years for anime in a long time
Made in abyss is a masterpiece. The art goes so well with the story. “Hauntingly,beautiful tale.” It truly is
Chainsaw Man was not number one I'm literally crying and shaking.
My favorite anime of 2022 was dance dance danseur. I also liked love after world domination
The amount of times you made me laugh by saying "gay girls in it"
My roommate knocked on my door while I was watching this video. I was like, "Yeah? Come in." and hit the pause button. She opened the door, opened her mouth to say something, got a confused look on her face, then said, "I'll ask you later." and shut the door. I turned around and looked at the screen. What did I see?   PENIS LIFE!
Not one issekai???
Not yet
Made in Abyss might be magical and whatever, but what the hell Garnt..? Grant or whatever the name was, GIGGUK???  Where's the 'FEEL LIKE NUMBER ONE...'??!? WHERE'S BLEACH MY DUDE?????
Sometimes I wish YouTube had a super like button
Aristotle suggested, "A tragedy is the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself ... with incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions."  That is Made in Abyss. A complete and utter tragedy.
1:12 Lhh this HAD TO HAVE BEEN ON PURPOSE RIGHT??!!!? This is a joke RIGHT?!!!
Garnt putting Bocchi above Chainsaw Man is absolutely BASED.
Call of the night was the shit! would recommend
Thank you for this video Garnt, amazing as always
Amazing list surprised ranking of Kings wasn't on here though.
Made in abyss ducks
call of the night is the cure for night owls, becuase it puts you to sleep
Gundam fans proud moment  Anyway u forgot one important thing to mention, one of most gundam thing ever happened  but i guess you keep it as spoiler, that will do
Man, Garnt just continues to get better and better…..I don’t even know how he does it. Also great #1 that got emotional
BLEACH?!?
Man I only saw like 4 of these! I should go watch the others, they look really good!
chills...can't wait for garnt to talk about trigun stampede😈😏
10:18 I felt it😂😂😂cuz my name is Liam n I was up watching YouTube at 3😂😂😂😂
25:56 Damn you Gigguk. I did not expect that anime but just when the first bits of the melody started i had literal goosebumbs and tears started pouring :D   There are a few soundtracks which, when they play, they stop time around me. I doesnt matter what i do in that moment i just freeze and the feelings overwhelm me. This is now definitly one of them and i just love it.
To all those amazing anime described by Garnt, i'll add the best mystery anime i've seen this year: Shadows House 2nd Season. Cloverworks managed to do what they should have done with the 2nd season of The Promised Neverland: adapt a manga to perfection.
Mark Goldbridge had me💀 and Dannyaarons😭😭😭
Why did Jojo not make the list?
MASSIVE props for putting Made in Abyss where it belongs
Let's go, it's always so hype to see this video popping up in my feed again.
1:26 what's this anime?  The one with flying whales
bro im waiting for new made in abyss chapters like a drug addict waiting for his dealer to resupply  also old stories and voh are legit masterpieces by themselves,combined with this anime made it so much more emotional and amazing, kevin truly is a blessing
Considering that I am an American, that “unless you’re in America” quote for call of the night was the funniest s@$? In this video to me.
Ash and Messi both winning world cup is a giant Pog moment
This guy never fails me with his videos
AOT is becoming about as final as final fantasy
Dude talked the world cup and didn't mention brazil, neymar and the pigeon dude wth
Your videos genuinely give me chills because of how well you explain the shows in such a relatable and almost poetic way.  Your videos are so high quality. I love you man, thanks for doing what you do.
No mention of shield hero season 2 lmao, very understandable...
Made in abyss 2nd season definitely deserve it because it was a really rich, dense and complex experience, and its climax is a perfect representation of the duality of the human being.
I SWEAR ITS NOT 3AM LEAVE ME ALONE
Don't think I didn't noticed that Link Click OST at the end
I'll be honest. I saw cyberpunk as number 3 and was like...then what the fuck did I miss? But the explanation for the number 2 and especially number 1 got me. Made in the Abyss hurt my soul in a way I don't think any other show has ever hurt me.
Agreed with most picks except chainsaw man
Wow, I think this is the only time I've seen a top anime list and wanted to watch everything on it. Oh backlog
10:07 watching this in the middle of the night...
10:15 fuck you that was terrifying
Gay girls inn'it
I firmly thought my dress up darling was gonna win 1. But I was absolutely not expecting made in abyss be in top 3, let alone first. Absolutely deserved. This season scarred me hard. But it was so damn good. I couldn't stop watching.
For some reason DIY wasn't in the number one spot. Troubling.
thank you Gigguk \o/
LMAO, as a fan of the old Romance of the Three Kingdom Drama, I didn't expect him to use Wang Lang's death clip.
Made in Abyss 2 deserves #1. I still can't get over how amazing Fapta's japanese voice actor is, like, I rarely notice stuff like that in anime but this was impossible not to notice. Also, the OST was on par with Season 1, which already was my favourite OST out of all anime. Kevin Penkin is a magician of music.
well one anime that definetly deserves attention is "akebi chans sailor uniform". also i really was expecting "renai flops" to be mentioned, given how Gigguk made an extra video about his favorite dumpster fire "domestic kanojo", because renai flops completely and utterly sh*ts on domestic kanojo in every way possible.
I must be really jaded on anime these days that absolutely nothing on this list catches my attention.
I didn't even know Made in Abyss season 2 came out...
LOOOL damn wrong name at the wedding tho thats bad luck lol
Editing is on fucking POINT!
1:12 FINALLY!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉CONGRATULATIONS 🎊
These recent years have been insane, 2019 I thought it was the best year for anime (on a side note rts is still unmatched by anything in the form of fiction), 2021 I thought damn how can this get better, and this year...no I actually don't think we'll get such a packed year for a while Even though I'm already having a blast with vinland saga and NieR Automata
Bleach tybw? My hero academia season 6? 😕
You sonovab*tch u did it again
You know 2021 was pretty good but what could make it bet-gaygirlsinit
14:36 When Bond said "borf" I felt that.
CPE was so good😭😭
YESSS I’ve been waiting for this!
9:20 killed me hahahahahahaahahahahah omg
Where is BLEACH?!
Wait what’s 14
11:14 Is this from the actual show? if so can someone provide Ep? and if its a meme source???????
Hold up, did the Tifa stuff happen in 2022???? I thought it was like 2 years ago
Wait what summer time render was locked behind disney+ ? What the fuck why aaaaaa no wonder nobody was talking about it
Hey Gigguk. Could you please make a video about the most underrated anime in 2022?   Because honestly, I see that there are many great anime this year that deserve more attention, and I personally consider them from the best anime of 2022. Like Tomodachi Game, Fuuto PI and Akiba Maid war and others.
This is awesome
I'm gonna be honest. The best of Chainsaw Man hasn't been animated yet. Someday we'll get there.
What about arcane?
lets gooo finnaly some love for made in abyss thank you gigguk thank you so much it really does deserve the first place
Ironically kaguya was how I got into anime
The c in 'euclidian' is pronounced as a k, not as an s.
I was really suprised to see Made in Abyss in this spot. Since it's my favorite Anime I'm glad to see it gets the recognition it deserves. But damn did Gigguk a good job describing the essence of not only this series but most of the ones on the list. Thank you very much for this banger of a video.
I love that he didn't put demon slayer too high.
This man is the funniest human being I have ever had the please of being in a completely one sided relationship with.
Made in Abyss I......Jesus Christ. I have never cried so many times in any piece of media. Your right with how it makes you feel. I almost cried when you brought it up and still holding back tears as I write this. There really is no other anime like it. If someone hasn't seen it just...really prepare yourself. It hits like nothing you have ever seen. Anyway great list and fun to watch as always. On to the winter and spring shows. Also I'm gonna go cry now because it aint going away.
Shout out to Liam  being awake at 3am.
Wait, as someone who hasn't seen Berserk, is Made in Abyss just moe Berserk? All the comparisons about how haunting and dreadful the world is for the characters who inhabit it, but in the end its about the triumphs and the peaks the characters reach in spite of it all?
Man it was a really good year for anime, there is almost too much to even keep up with, so it was great to see this recap! Love these every year
No shit, he got me, its 3am in my time zone…
Date a live IV didn't even get mentioned😢
pe- venus line caught me off guard haha
1. Demon Slayer 2. Gundam 3. Spy Family
Goddammit it. actually is 3 am🫥🫥. Fine I'll watch it😃
are we denying that aot exists or what?😂
My favorite part of Made in Abyss is how unhinged and wacky its creator is lmao Damn sniff fiend
Just the fact that Edgerunners AND Summertime Render made it on this list?  .... ABSOLUTE Ws!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's crazy how your such an influencer that I automatically agree with (almost) anything you say. You must got plot armor. Wait... your the PROTAGONIST! 😮
Imagine not walking at night in non-urban America you literally missed half the fun parts of this country you better let us show you the call of the night next time you tour here goober boy
No Overlord season 4?!?!?
excuse you, it's not 3am yet it's only 1am
What's the anime @1:27 with the whales?
Why is Gigguk still pretending that G-Witch is the only newcomer gundam anime? So many of the AUs and OVAs work as standalones series or starting points. In the Fall of Mecha video he dismissed Iron-Blooded Orphans too (which also has more corporate than national politics)
Cyberpunk now is a great game btw
Thank you for putting edgerunners in there but why you so right that song make me wanna cry 😭
worldcup talk kinda cringe man. dont support qatar
Makima fans deserve jail
Made in abyss is so dope I cried so much but hell after a few months I’ll rewatch
Fuck............ it's 4:30 AM
bro ur such a mother fucker u have a way with words like no one else  nice vid
i feel so attacked
I am so happy to see Made in Abyss at the top. What a beautiful, horrific masterpiece
Where is the Attack on Titans? Is this some kind of joke? It is not in your top 17, considering that it is in the nominees for anime of the year and can win, and this will be the second year in a row. And you yourself praised AoT and gave this anime several nominations when you voted at the Anime Awards just a few days ago.
Babe wake up new Gigguk video dropped
So, to the million-dollar question, was Gigguk able to wrap his head around the offside rule?
Thank you grant. ❤
The year isn't over until gigguk drops the vid
The editing is top notch
19:10  I've never felt more called out in my life
Another great video but honestly have to disagree with your number 1 since I couldn't get past all the borderline pedophilia that goes on in MiA. I just had to drop it afterlike the 5 episode
The 2022 anime season rival that of 2019, it has truly be an incredible year for all that anime that could not be launched in 2020 and 2021. Also One Piece Wano story arc was fire during the year.
man 2022 sure went by in a flash. I remember watching Attack on Titan, professed wiseman pupil, Dress up Darling, land of leadale, Realist hero, prince debt, (most anticipated) World End Harem, Sabikui Bisco, strongest sage weakest crest, and arifureta in winter like it was yesterday.   Then came Spring with our first taste of SpyxFamily, then Kaguya (felt like it was from summer), Shikimori (which was cute), Komi-san (fun thursdays), and Otome Mob with Im quitting heroing as the isekai of the season (lets act like shield hero never existed). Also credit to Science love, Skeleton knight, typical nobody and bookworm making spring more fun.  In Summer we had the continuation of Summertime Rendering that was the 10/10 Dark horse of the season while Couple of Cuckoos plot was horse shit but i like it. Overlord was back with Ainz all grown. We had our psychological mindgames expert Ayanokoji and our vampire fetish in call of the night. Don't forget Labyrinth and Vermeil ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). LycoReco & Made in abyss 👍 while rent gf & part-timer were 😑. Black summoner, white pharmacy and blue strongest slime sage...  and now Fall came to a close. Honestly the best season of the year with BLEACH coming back and fan favorite CSM. Mob Psycho final season was fantastic and bluelock x worldcup was fire. My most awaited isekai eminence showing its worth and Bocchi the rock the true cgdct underdogs the season (with 'The Little Lies We All Tell'). Can't believe i watched 22 airing anime this season, so i can't mention all of them.  I wrote down all of this just to say- Its been a great year guys and hope 2023 gets better.
Was not expecting Garnt's review of the World Cup and, tbh, I agree. Top anime of the year.
Sadly i don't had the time for the last two Years watching anime. I did not see any of the anime you recommended in this video. And still, every year i watch you summery. Shur i hope for a recommendation that i will write on my full list. But the main point is because regardless of the Anime you recommend i love to watch your video, hear how you describe the Anime with such perfect words and even i couldn't watch them my self i can resonate with what you are telling and get a glims of what an journey they were watching. I love this summery of the year. For your Cinematography, your Script and for the emotions and passion you resonate when talking about each of the Anime. Thank you for 10 Years "Best of Anime 20..."
I know this is an anime video, but since you talked about the world cup i need to do this, if i dont, it could be unpatriotic from be.  **Clears throat**  En Argentina nací Tierra del Diego y Lionel De los pibes de Malvinas Que jamás olvidaré No te lo puedo explicar Porque no vas a entender Las finales que perdimos Cuantos años la lloré Pero eso se terminó Porque en el Maracaná La final con los brazucas La volvió a ganar papá Muchaaaaaaaaaaachoooooos Ahora nos volvimos a ilusionar Quiero ganar la tercera Quiero ser campeón mundial Y al Diego Desde el cielo lo podemos ver Con Don Diego y La Tota Alentándolo a Lionel Muchaaaaaaaaachooooooooooos Ahora nos volvimos a ilusionar Quiero ganar la tercera Quiero ser campeón mundial Y al Diego Desde el cielo lo podemos ver Con Don Diego y La Tota Alentándolo a Lionel, y ser campeones otra vez, y ser campeones otra vez
Severely disappointed that Garnt didn't show Maaa's cake at the end.
Applying the rule of three to "... Gay girls innit?"    Comedy genius.
Sent this video already to a few friends what a great way to preview something you might want to..  recommendation that wasn't on the list but really surprised me and enjoying is  The Eminence in Shadow – Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute
19:42Imao
As cool as Cyberpunk Edgerunners is, I think the ending is absolutely terrible. Everything felt like it was all for nothing and I never felt like I got time to care about the characters due to how fast paced it was. I haven’t seen anyone else complain about this except me and my friend.
Edgerunners is the G.O.A.T of this year hands down. Idc that show hit way too hard for me to think anything else.
I feel very called out
We both never had this much overlap in our lists. Even though you dont know me, knowing that there are humans feeling and experiencing the same things I do through this incredibly medium makes me happy.
Liams at 3Am: 💀
for me this year is marked by edgerunners and worst thing that happened to jojo
2022 was an absolutely insane year for anime. Like from beginning to end the year was packed. My personal favorite underrated gem was Ya Boy Kongming but Mob Psycho 3 was anime of the year for me
Brotha where bleach at tho?  Btw big fan but i noticed that you like the less popular showes just because they are less popular like the top 3. The shoudnt be there and yet you put them, all love tho❤
You can’t just hit me with the I really wanna stay at your house. Imma cry
SIEG ZEON !!! SIEG ZEON !!!
9:40 Yep,i had more thrill watching WC than BL,also you just missed Anya at this match few moments ago
Been a helluva year, looking forward to another year of watching your great vids! Congrats on the wedding and thanks for all the work and content you give us!
7:18 I burst into laughter and tears at the same time.
What's the song at 10:32 ?
It’s always the action we enjoy most.
Mushoku Tensei 2023
Eminence in shadow
You know, it is an incredible anime year, when Gigguk couldn't put Bleach into Top 18 anime in a single year. It's incredible how stacked this year was
Mid in Abyss is overrated and relies on shock value and a high budget.
I'm glad CSM didn't make it into top 3 in the list.  The hype of CSM before its anime adoption is an entire "afterthought" of the manga fans. Manga readers know how crazy the story will be after the anime season1.  "None of characters" are being impressive in the season 1(roughly first 20 episodes in manga) until readers hit the later story. It's just a normal shounen show at the beginning. Many manga readers also complained the char design of Makima was being meh/too simple, Power was annoying at the moment, but they all changed their mind later. With that amount of budget for the adaptation, we obviously would expect something good. The S1 was just good, to me it just hit the bear minimal but not amazing. Even the S1 is probably the weakest part in the entire story. This part is not the reason why ppl so hyped about the CSM. Let's be honest, my question is: for those who only watch CSM anime, what you so hyped about, especially the character part? TBH the true character development has not yet started. I got why manga readers were so crazy about, ain't you guys just being fake hype because of the original fanbase? As Gigguk said in the video, "we ain't seen nothing yet"
Finished edgerunners yesterday and I don’t know what to do.
vjKakosi yes. idk just yes im having thoughts and shit, almost got off my ass to finish a few of theese shows i remember i loved what i saw of and then i remembered i have some deadlines and shouldnt
There's just not many words that can do Made in Abyss justice. Season 1 and Dawn of the Deep Soul were already fantastic enough, but season 2 exceeds your expectations  and completely blows you away. It's poetry in storytelling from beginning to end truly.
Let’s see the bones and trigger collab
Grant, here, take my like.  _You get what you f-ing deserve!_
It's been a while since I felt something about anime until I watched Made in the Abyss, I can totally understand about this being the top of 2022. Looking forward to more vids with you Grant!
I've watched all of these anime except the football ones - considering I despise football from the depths of my heart, I think that's fine
ANOTHER ABSOLUTE BANGER!  THANK YOU BASED ANIME GOD 🛐
Disney my ass I'm a pirate
Any Made in Abyss praise gets a huge thumbs up from me..truly one of my absolute favorite pieces of fiction ever
Ya boy kongming was amazing. It was such a shame the animation was very lacking. Great moments were simply slideshows with music or exposition, especially the actual concerts. Had they animated it more, it could have been so much better.
wait so no attack on titan or mushoku tensei? did i miss a page?
My name isn't Liam, but that still felt personal
Garen't argue with that.
18:36 Yes. It did. It did meet the hype. What are you blind?  It destroyed the Hype and went further beyond. This man really out here calling Chainsaw Man, "It's good"
K-on music is better than bocchi the rock
I still don't understand how people love Makima so much she's fucking creepy
anime will not the get Best Of me  2023 style i tell you what
No no no no no no no no no no no BLEACH WHERE TF IS BLEACH AGHHHHHHHHH
#1: Made in Abyss #0: Bleach: WHO SAID THAT THE TOP TEN ANIME OF THE YEAR WERE RANKED 1 THROUGH 10?!
Man what a video, funny, emotion and so entertaining ❤️😊
Bro . . . I felt so attacked whe you said my name xD
Aot and Bleach not in top 15? Are u kidding?
BASED TAKE BASED MADE IN ABYSS BASED MANGA WOOOOO
Ngl I never felt connected with made in abyss and idk why, it's probably the same situation with mob psycho and I just need to refresh my mind and rewatch the show to understand it properly, before rewatching mob I never thought it was special, but now it's one of my all time favorites and I love it so much so made in abyss will recieve a rewatch I guess
Gay girls are the answer to any question about making something better or interesting.
How dare u guess the time I'm watching this video and get half my name right. Are u in my room or something? Lol
My Man Garnt you gotta stop bitching about AoT every damn time that name comes up,we all can agree that you already know how it ends🤷🏻😆
Based for made in abyss
I know my opinion is unpopular, but "reincarnated as a sword" for me is in top 15 for sure. "Ya Boy KongMing" that you've put on 16th place is very good, I've watched it. But Fran is just too cute to be behind "Ya Boy KongMing," imho. It's only because of Fran though, but still. Fran is taking the same place as Marin Kitagawa for me. Or Makima for you :P
No Akiba Maid War
Not having Jojo here was a huge miss. Stop making "But Netflix" excuses. It's all there, we all know it's all there, go watch it.
So can we call Hunter X Hunter, Hunter²?
2022 was a BANGER, here's to a bigger one 😁
Spy x Family season 2 opening is the most beautiful thing I've seen
I miss MAAAAAAAAAAA :(
Excesu me sir, where are THE ISEKAIS?  You didn't put a single isekai title in the ranking, you didn't even put a single isekai joke in them. What a weird year for anime this  must had been. No wonder I didn't watch that much, I do plan on catching up to that Higurashi clone and new Gundem thanks to your video.
Lmao never thought I'll ever see Angry Rantman in a Gigguk video.
Is Garnt still watching anime dubbed in English
Yeaaaahh I'm pretty pissed he didn't mention Morocco while talking about the world cup
looking back, there wasn't anything else that could have been #1. it was a completely different experience
Been having one hell of a day and even one hell of a year so far and we've just started, still despite it all I find a ton of comfort in these silly videos, keep up the good work Garnt.
Anime 2022 : GAY GIRLS ISN'T IT
Summer time rendering is now available.
I heavily disagree with Mob being 2nd, but besides that great video as always, looking foward for 2023 animes
D*** I was sitting here when he put mob psycho at  number 2 Thinking to myself what the h*** did you put a number one and then that intro rolls for maiden abyss and I was like oof Yup he right
I sat here watching without realizing it has been 30 minutes- thank you Garnt for all your hard work <3
Edgerunners is overrated...  But still really good and I do recommend watching it to anyone who hasn't.
I have watched you for a long time, 6:19 best reference of all time.  Like I don't think I have even ever commented saying something was a particularly good joke although these end of year episodes always make me laugh.  but now you've peaked, it's all down hill from here :p.
One show that I really loved this year that I didn't see on your list is Romantic Killer. Delightfully original concept, great comedy, strong characters, solid romance. Just overall a surprisingly good show that gave me a lot of joy this year.
Thought this entire list was pretty safe and generic until you redeemed yourself with Made in Abyss
I didn't need to be called out like that Gigguk. I know I need to watch the new Gundam, but life is hectic and I haven't started it yet.
It’s so hard to believe that all these anime were released in 2022. I thought dress-up darling and Kaguya released somewhere in 2020/2021
Other than Gundam, Chainsaw man and Mob Psycho III  this is a good yearly anime list.  cant comment on made in abysses since ive never seen any
Fitgirl?
So now that their RomCom has ended. Does that mean the show is over or we getting a sequel? You know sequels are never as good though.
Amazing video grant, best best of list
I heard the smash joke and I laughed.
sad eminence in shadow wasnt here
isn't call of the night where the main character is tired of being human and has a vampire girl?
Wait, how does Gantt know what the best anime of 2022 is when the Chunchyroll anime awards haven't dropped yet??
GZ
Gigguk, I've discovered your channel last year, and let me say this, you are one of the biggest reasons I got really heavily into anime, I used to watch One piece with my brother when I was little, but I was never really interested, until I watched ProZD's meme video on the Evangelion opening , after watching Eva 2 years ago(my fourth anime) I realised that I really liked anime, but I did not know how could I get into It, also at the time I had no friends who watched anime, and I really needed someone to talk to about Eva. Thats when I stumbled upon your channel, and saw your "Thank you Evangelion" video and let me say that from there, your videos are always my go to for the seasonal anime I watch or in general a second opinion I can have for some anime I have watched. So, after this damn long paragraph I say this from the bottom of my heart, Thank you.
MORE MADE IN ABYSS RECOGNITION LET'S GOOOOOOO GARNT!!
Kaguya has easily become my favourite anime of all time. I’ve rewatched it so many times at this point I could probably recite every episode and line by memory. It’s so deceptively smart in the way it evolves it’s gags and develops it’s characters without making you realise it’s just perfect. In many ways, the insanity of the visual gags in Bocchi is very much a natural evolution of the visual gags in Kaguya, which is a testament to how fucking creative and well directed Kaguya is.  For anime onlys who don’t know, the anime is only about half way through the manga. The author stated he wanted to spend the same amount of time focusing on Kaguya and Miyuki before and after they get together. So we’ve almost certainly got another fantastic 3 seasons worth of content left that are just as good as what came before (maybe not as good as the cultural festival but still)
"Reigen the man full of bullshit, he can sell hamon to a stand user" Had me dying
3 cups lets fucking gooooo ARGENTINAAA!!! (yes im argentinian, also great video)
i come here for anime recommendations
86, counting both cours, was probably my favorite anime of the year. I think a lot of people missed the second cour because the last few episodes were delayed until March of 2022.
Amazing video. You have outdone yourself like always
Well now I know what I’m watching this 2023
Man just has his Thai Wedding but still uploaded
There's just something about Gigguk's writing that just knocks it out of the park!
Personally I would swap Mob psycho #2 100 & Made in abyss #1  Imo Mob was perfect all the way through and s3 had the best messages, writing & character growth in the series. It deserves top spot.  Made in abyss was a unique yet gross & dark  Rollercoaster full of emotions. I went down a path I did not expect it to go. For me it holds the #2 spot.
I got to watch dragon ball super super heroes and one piece film red with the homies In the theaters I call that a W for 22 alone 😎
wasn't mushoku tensei Nominated for an award this year? wouldn't that mean that season 1 part 2 came out in 2022?  I'm surprised gigguk didn't mention it in this video
The editing in this video is bonkers
all in the premire live chat went "WOOF" when he was describing makima
Call of the night had amazing vibes
YES!! Made in Abyss! I'm so glad Gigguk gave it the recognition it deserves again
I think I agree with most picks except for Witch from Mercury. I mean, animation and music is absolutely great, Episode 0 is amazing, and the last two episodes are really good, but the number of nonsense and conveniences you have to purposefully ignore for the most part of the show to get to those episodes almost made me drop it. I would put it  in 15th just because I didn't watch any of the 3 sports anime from the list. All of the other I found better than that Gundam.
Chainsaw man >>>>>>>> this video.
There's a lot of competition for best of the year but the biggest let down is pretty easy. Shield hero 2, rip. Not that was it even that bad, at least after the turtle arc, but just compared to how much I expected from it and how long we waited with all the delays, ouch.
*watch jojos*
Damn Garnt, you made me cry.  Incredible content 👏👏👏👏
Didnt even mention eminence in shadow. unsubscribing
Was not expecting a Goldbridge cameo at all
HELL YEAH GOT HOME FROM WORK HAVING A SPICY PIZZA WHILE WATCHING 8:00 HELL YEAH MY DRESS-UP DARLING ❤
*CHAINSAW*
Personally, Chainsaw Man and Mob Psycho III are my favorite of 2022. As much as how powerful Made in Abyss 2 is, it was too powerful for me that I needed something fun or laid-back.   Either ways, it was still a great year for Anime 2022.
I can't wait for Muzan's speech to be animated
l watched all of them and I think made in abyss was right choice ( if we not consider aot )
OH THE UPCOMING SEASON FOR AOT IS A PART 1 FOR GOODNESS SAKE I DECIDED TO WATCH THE SERIES NOW BECAUSE I DIDNT THINK I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG FOR AN ENDING
His scripts are just something out of this world, I'll probably rewatch it 20 times
25:57 Hear this? I heard 5 notes and I already had a big smile on my face and tears in my eyes. Damn that anime is good!    ...Also...      LET'S GO!!!!! MADE IN ABYSS ANIME OF THE YEARS TWICE WITH TWO SEASONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate to be that guy, but what about One Piece?
I can’t believe the Isekai Uncle Anime didn’t make it onto Garnt‘s list, he is literally the isekai man😂
Just realized there was a lot of "gay girls, innit?" in 2022 anime, and the best part is that 2023 is gonna have EVEN MORE of that! ^^
Damn, 2022 was so great, I'm about to cry
ok I'll be using a trick from our good buddy Hondo ohnaka for Summertime Rendering.  see you on the boat boys :D
it's been five years since the first made in abyss, and the cat's out of the bag: it's for pedophiles, made by a pedophile, packed full of garbage for pedophiles.
best anime of 2022 from the most jaded anime watchers that they hardly even watch anime
Another grant vid
Hey, you may have scheduled this at 3 am your time, but’s it dropped at 3 pm on a Sunday for me. That’s perfectly reasonable YouTube time. Also my name is not Liam.
Only a Gigguk video can make me as exited as a child on Christmas
9:00 True fact. The World Cup this year really was like an Anime. Bit strange that they didn't give any of their slaves to the winners/protagonist team but still...
The makima fans part 😂😂
A KINGDOM HEARTS REFERENCE!!!
"Stay at your house" still fucking kills me every time
GAY GIRLS INITT.................................
Bro forgot one piece exists. One piece had 2022 in a head lock. Was trending so much couldn't avoid it on my timeline.
Legends have it Mob was placed second for the perfect transition
i cant why ppl are so into makima, she's so clearly evil and manipulative (haven't read the manga btw pls no spoil)
So glad made in abyss was #1 it deserved so much more attention
Haven't even started the video and I'm already putting my like and comment in for the YouTube algorithm. Gigguk makes some of the CLEANEST videos on the platform. The scripting, music selection, editing and effects all combined together to create a masterful tapestry, that chronicles another chapter in the history of Anime. This guy needs to have a course on "How to use online videos to tell a story". Garnt, Thanks for all the hard work you put into the channel to keep us "weebs and gamers" well fed. 👍
you did it again, you nailed it..
I was not prepared when I watched Made In Abyss 2. Definitely deserves the number one slot. But yeah, don't be fooled by the playful chibi animation style, some of the concepts are about as dark as any piece of fiction can be.
Reze best girl
As a really fan of Higurashi and Umineko, I'm watching top 10 without seeing your thoughts  You just sold it when you mentioned Higurashi
It’s incredible that it only takes a few notes to tell what anime’s next
everytime grant uploads is a blessing from heaven
Ok, I'd like to hear a bit more why you think CSM Season 1 hasn't met the hype? I read the manga and thought the anime was simply incredible.
wait mob psycho s3 came out?!
I burst out laughing when you mentioned Himeno fans and showed the orangutan picture. I don’t why that’s so funny to me, but it is. I fucking love Chainsaw Man.
Goated channel, goatee video, goated wife
I'm so glad Made In Abyss got ranked at #1
just wanna thank you for these kinds of videos.  I don't necessarily can explain it but the way you sometimes describe the Anime and the clever cuts and use of music just constantly makes me jump from sobbin to laughing back to sobbing and then again laughing.  It's rare that a video, or any piece of media really, has this kind of effect on me, so thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Gay girls in it is so good :^)
Made in Abyss is beautiful, haunting, mysterious but fucking gross. Like really  fucking gross. And as much as I love everything else about it, I cannot get past how sick the author clearly is, shoving his horrible fetishes into an otherwise great story. It’s getting worse as it goes on too
Made in abyss was by far my favourite and I watched every single anime on this list and more. And that is not healthy
1:13
Vinland saga?????
That one Liam watching this at 3 am gonna have a blast
86 not on the list is an absolute rip off
Gigguk is anituber equivalent of one piece. It's still going and getting better on top of that.
How fucking stupid are the ones who copyright stricked a video giving them free publicity. They make their companies lose so much money
how the f did I miss the ao ashi is an anime?
10:09 when he said "come on its 3 am" it is litterelly 3:08 am in my place holy shit
Na forget Kon for slice of life intro, lucky star the real start of cute girl doing cute things!
WOOO
:0
I was waiting so patiently. Heart slightly pounding during the whole video, I waited. During the final transition to the #1 anime I held my breath and my heart stopped, until, old stories by Kevin Penkin started to play and I cheered out. Happiness, sadness, and nostalgia pouring out of me as the made in abyss title appears on screen. I felt... proud.
it's literally 3:30 am bro 😭
I have never seen the internet try to gaslight itself into thinking a show is worth your time as hard as I have with Spy X Family.
5:24 Hey now, no disrespecting the vending machine isekai on my watch, it's actually GOOD! xD
Man, Summertime Rendering was a disappointment. Mystery shows can't succeed if the mystery is fucking dumb nonsense.
you are incredible, the quality of your video is just so god damn high, your humours videos are still some of my favourite videos on youtube. and even though this is partly due to my attachment to the shows your the way you describe them accompanied with the music just elevates my emotions for them. you are truly an incredible youtuber.
gay girls innit
I just realized that it's because of Yofukashi no Uta, that I enjoy walking back home at 5 or 6 AM. How haven't I thought about it earlier?
Made in Abyss has always been a favorite of mine and I'm so glad it got such a great season 2   <3
Summertime Rendering had S tier animation but the character designs were kinda bland. The MC is basically Eren if he had Tanjiros voice. 9/10 anime
made in abyss music reminded me of land of the lustrous music for some reason
bro forgot bleach
Thanks for consistently putting out incredible recaps! I can't wait for whatever this year has to bring
2:17 Is that an Armored core reference?
based opinion
5:57 made me laugh
86 s2?
MADE IN ABYSS GOT FIRST LETTSS GOOO
Bocchi the Rock isn't slice of life!!! It's a music/coming of age comedy drama anime!!!!
Great recap, 2022 was a fire anime year 🔥
Garnt has managed to perfect trashing and praising MP100 at the same time.
27:02 "non-yousidian"
Can't agree more with made in abyss. No anime has made me feel as depressed and happy as made in abyss has. The atmosphere and music and world is like no other anime has ever had and I can't recommend it enough to people who haven't watched it
Great list only thing i would have put Summertime render little higher but dis mans taste is not Trash in anime
GUUUUNDAMMMMM LETS GO BOI
Last year was absolutely amazing for anime fans. I watched 53 animes, dropped 8 of them, so finished 45 of them. And the dropped ones weren't even bad. I just sometimes don't feel like continuing a show despite it still being good. Anyway, I usually have my favorite shows, then a clear cut A tier and then everything else is mixed together in B tier down. This year, it was like I had my top 3 (Dress up Darling, Spy Family and Bocchi. Maybe Made in Abyss could replace Bocchi), and then everything else fighting in A and B tier with only a few in C and only 3 shows in D tier. Last year was just stacked from start to end.
I didn´t see made ina byss coming at 1 or at the list in general but i wholeheartedly agree. Somehow these show like made in abyss, To your rternety and Mushishi just amke me feel things and take me to places that seem more real than the present.
This video just killed it. Each and every point.  Shame that here where I live in is mid day, the Liam joke didn't work LMAO  The "Venus" song haha John wick + waifu version 10/10 Marin and Garnt's wife LMAO Can not believe that actual world cup was more anime than anime Oh Mickey, you did it again, you weren't satisfied with Marvel and Lucasfilms, right?! Spy X Family's "The X is silent or not" LMAO. So accurate how it brightens your days :')   Gundams sound design video edit was supreme. Makima. LMAO. Kesoku Band x2, x3 y x1000. Surprised with that. Cries in Keanu listening to "I really want to stay in your house". Yes, Now my mind is telling me "Told you, watch made from the Abyss."
am I the only one who uses this videos of end of years to watch all the good anime because I couldn't be bothered keeping up with the releases
Not a single mention of the last evangelion movie and the ending of the that franchise....
“Gae gurls, innit?”    –Gigguk.
My top 5 anime of 2022 are (in no particular order)  Bocchi the Rock Cyberpunk Edgerunners Kotaro Lives Alone Love Live Superstar S2 Chainsaw Man
I found Made in Abyss sololy through the Music I heard in Rising of the Shield Hero and thought "wow, that music is absolutely stunning for an anime". Looked up the composer (they are the same), watched Made in Abyss. I´ll never forget what I saw, it´s horrifying yet beautiful at the same time.
17-Birdie Wing 16-Ya Boy Kongming! 15-Lycoris Recoil 14-My Dress-Up Darling 13-Aoashi 12-Blue Lock 11-Call of the Night 10-Summer Time Rendering 9-Demon Slayer 8-Spy X Family 7-Gundam the Witch from Mercury 6-Love is War 5-Chainsaw Man 4-Bocchi the Rock! 3-Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2-Mob Psycho 1-Made in Abyss
i would like to argue that bocchi has a modicum of gay girls
19:20 WHY YOU GOTTA CALL ME OUT LIKE THAT
attak on titan final sesson is the final fantasy of anime
Dang it Garnt, when that Cyberpunk music came on
Jokes on you gigguk, it's 12 a.m. for me
Spy family has some great competition in buddy daddys :3
also i love that made in abyss is number 1 that is one of my all time favourites it leaves a deep impression and after watching it you just feel kinda empty
I've tried to watch the first season of made in Abyss 3 times, but i stopped like 5 episodes inn everyone of thoses times. And it's not for any of the reasons Gigguk mentioned, I just need everyone who is thinking about watching the seiries that it has some pedophile undertones. It's never full on pedophilia like sertain other anime, but still enough to be very off putting, so if you are easily put off by that, you might wanna stay clear of this one
Made in abyss became the only anime to win 2 anime of the year from Grant
This really shows you how each person is different, the fact that Grant put Made in the Abyss as his Number 1 But for me this was the year of Edgrunners, but mostly because it was able to present a complete and amazin story in just 10 episodes. No second seasons, no part 2 just 10 great episodes with no filler. Summertime rendering is a strong contender as well, but the Final episode brings it down quite a lot for me.
Darn, was hoping to see "Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games Is Tough for Mobs". That one's sarcasm had me smiling (if not laughing) throughout.
25:53  THAT TRANSITION WAS SO SMOOTH
25:59 What's the name of this song?
Gigguk always has good taste, but when he puts Call of the Night on #11 over those other animes, gotta say that's a hot take. I always knew he was biased towards it though. When you break down what's good about that anime, it's really ONLY the night scene and the opening. The characters suck ass, the story sucks ass, and the anime style sucks ass. Have you seen the way they draw her boobs get dragged like a paint mistake streak? Like, cool, you're thirstin' on night life theme, but man do you oversell it. And don't get me started on the lore.  Also I'm not watching Made in Abyss even after this. It's not that I'm afraid, it's that I've had my fill of that sort.  Now that I've gotten being a Devil's Advocate or Contrarian out of the way, I'll say this is a good list. Thank you. All the other compliments, other comments have already given.
What is it with everyone praising the Made in Abyss season? It was a huge disappointment after a strong first season and a meh film and every youtuber seems to cream himself talking about season two.
I hate how Gigguk so accurately described what happened to Cyberpunk fans after watching Edgerunners cause as soon as "I want to stay at your house" played I started tearing up
10:15 I CONSIDER THIS A PERSONAL ATTACK...
D-Did you seriously start the list with a golf anime?
ffs this must have been the best anime year. we might have reached peak anime. there was just a row of anime of the year from 6 up
Call of the night was a personal favorite since it spoke to my insomniac impulsive self from high school. Regularly skipping class to sleep off my midnight walks for four years straight. Walking through dangerous neighborhoods and doing dangerous things thinking to myself "what was the worst that could happen?".
man i freaking have disney plus and i STILL cant watch Summer Time Rendering!
2022 was definitely a good year for anime, I can't wait to see what 2023 brings us with some of the most anticipated returns and new surprises! Thanks Gigguk for another amazing year in review video, until next time.
2022 was one of the best years for anime ever which is amazing since 2021 was also absolutely stacked.  The last two years have delivered so much anime goodness.  Bleach, Chainsaw Man, Demon Slayer, Spy x Family, Mob Psycho 100, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Lycoris Recoil, Made in Abyss, and One Piece carried the year for me.  It was a good mix of sequels and new franchises plus the best anime adaptation of a videogame ever.
"Reigen full of bs he could sell hamon to a stand user" Gigguk 2023
Now I'm sad I have to wait another year for the next "Best of". But I'm so glad Made in Abyss got the recognition it deserved, it got snubbed for Anime of the Year but I think this is a better win anyway.
No crunchyroll anime awards reaction
There was absolutely no reason to do Himeno fans as dirty as you did.
Summertime Rendering was so worth having to have another streaming service or dealing with all the local milfs in my areas
The yugioh music is appreciated
Where's Shadow Garden and Horimiya, they are not done in 2022, but absolutely amazing
we been eating good in 2022
Im still to scared to finish recoil
6:09 BING CHILLING
OMG. Angry rant made it into gigguk's video 🤣🤣
Damn you got good taste in memes. You deserve respect for the door to darkness
"accidentally played" yeah like anyone actually believes that
Made in abyss was so boring tbh, not sure why you hype it so much. Sure the soundtrack animation etc is top notch, but the story felt so stuck at that stupid village. So many new characters got intruduced and I'm expected to care about them? fuck no. And the worst part is that the manga is just a few chapters ahead. I guess for 10 years of serialization the author still hasn't figure out what's after 6th layer.
You know the year was stacked when Demon Hunter only get's 9th place.  Lycoris Recoil: Where at the end I was left going "Wait, the bad guy has a point".  Spy X Family: Has ruined all other child focused anime because it depicts kids as they actually are, barely socialized gremlins of adorableness, rather than as amorphic blobs of cute.  Witch From Mercury: Good to know that with Saitama still in the wings we've got ChuChu's One Paunch to rely on.
Me feeling old when my generation's romance anime was Toradora, and it has been usurped by the zoomer's gag manga.
If there is anything that's true, then it is that we haven't seen nothing yet in terms of chainsaw man.
Made in abyss is such a Masterpiece I spent a whole day at my room reminiscing about the anime, not going to work or appointments after I finished S2. It was just so beautiful and surreal experience for me.
20 : 28 K-on! is shit for me and I think it's the worst Kyoto Animation production. I don't know why it's ripoff is on 4th place here but okay, I will give it a try. I will watch it and I will use my right to hate everyone that say it's a good show. Happy 2023, everyone!
how do we make anime even better "gay girls innt"
Haven't watch made in Abyss one yet and recently watched Mob season 2. Guess I have some good stuff to look forward too. And yeah Edgerunners had such an impact with just 10 episodes.
YESSSS I LIKED THE VIDEO BEFORE I EVEN WATCHED IT
Так непривычно слышать настоящий голос Гигука а не его озвучку, но именно непривычно, а не приятно просто немного страно наверное...  А так ждëм когда переозвучат (Поздравляю вы нашли Русский комментарий)
“Nobody ever thinks about sound design”  Jacksepticeye would like to know your location
Thanks, Garnt, I believe that in one year I will watch all these videos and all the emotions again will kick me brutally with the soundtracks and all the passion behind these anime. For example, made in abyss's first soundtrack in the video: I just listened to it and didn't even recognize the anime immediately, but I felt all the sadness I had watching this anime. These shows are making me the man I am and I will not ever think of it as a waste of time like a lot of people do Unfortunately, my family doesn't share this interest with me and this makes me sad that I will never share my huge passion with them
Thank you for such a great year! Looking forward to more of your video's this year!
Thanks for always wrapping the year up for us. God damn I'm fuckin hyped by how good it was.
*I love this character's hair style. Like if you like it chainsaw man*
bruh the world cup was rigged Argentina should've never won from the Netherlands, Messi made hands on purpose and got nothing, and made many fouls while only getting like 1 card, just ridiculous.
label your marks better bro don't be a brick
I hear Pony Stark so much I gotta wonder if Gigguk has met them in person or at the very least pledged to name their firstborn after them.
Gay girls innit
Bro no bleach is fucking crazy 😭
how the fuck did he give #1 to a fucking sequel. I'm going to watch it out of spite
Great video Garnt!!
Crunchyroll should take a page from your book.
Soccer
The more popular a show is, the cooler you get for calling it mid"  Biiiiiig facts. People be trying way too hard to call big shows mid
Rewatching Made in Abyss and then going into season 2 truly reminded me of how glad I am to have started watching anime all those years ago. It's hauntingly beautiful.
Dammit man you always manage to make me cry... 😭 You are so good at conveying emotions in your writing style
Interesting list. I wouldn’t say I agree with all the choices, but the video was enjoyable nonetheless
Take a shot every time Gigguk says “gay girls ain’t it”
Made in abyss s2 was god like literally gave me every emotion possible
Man i know Gigguk keeps saying this, but personally and as a manga reader, the Chainsaw Man anime destroyed the hype in to pieces. It was everything and more than what i hoped for.
This looks better than the anime awards
jokes on you i am a liam and i work at 3am so f u.
I am sorry, no shade at Reincarnated as a Sword is needed.  That show is better than half the shows you listed.  If you watched it, you would def know.

Song at 25:57?
9:11 LETS GO MESSI!!!!
I cannot agree more with that wonderful description you’ve given on made in abyss, such great work!
Your the best
ahhhhhh my boy forgot ranking of kings
I can't stomach watching made in abyss for the life of me. I've seen what people say about the anime and I'm sure if you can get through the gore you'll love of it but just seeing all that god awful things happen to these small kids is degusting.
hahaha how to make an anime better have cute gay girls in it
yesssss
Bro said Bocchi 4th im dead
so glad he mentioned the world cup, I'm from argentina and you have no idea what it was like to witness that final as someone with the tittle on the line, I also thought that this was straight out of an anime, I was just waiting for the anime opening to start playing after emi martinez's epic save
Nah this Video was brutal how can I watch anything else this week without thinking "this ain't nearly as good as gigguk's video"
even though i've only started watching anime about a year and a half ago, i honestly loved it, and 2022 was awesome, it began with watching demon slayer season 2 in january to the ongoing blue lock, i also loved chainsaw man and attack on titan season 4 as well mob psycho season 3
2022 was a gigantic year for anime!
there's a green screen matrix like in the very last fram of this video. did anybody notice that too
MiA getting the attention it deserves!!!!
Made in abyss ost makes you feel things.
Really living up to your Trash Taste by putting Edgerunners anywhere near this video.
Its 3:18am and you got me
Ngl 2022 was a pretty good year for the anime community
The bleach fans are livid 🤣🤣🤣
Love the football memes 🤣🤣
You're great man
The best thing about CSM is that the first half is the weaker of the two and is STILL a 10/10 show.
I so want to believe Garnt's name being butchered was intentional
Always find these videos helpful for people trying to find that one anime witch stands heads above the rest. Happy to be here for the past 11 years and as always keep up the good work.
actually some made in a byss love, lets goo
Bruh made in abyss was good, but not the best of the year no way
Gigguk always surprising me with his high equality videos, keep it up.  2022 was a banger, lots of really good animes and I´m so happy to see Made in Abyss having this much view
I'm so proud of beeing an anime fan .. thank you alot guigguk.. you forever will be my influence to the universe of animation and its miasmic beauty.
@10:10 I was not expecting that call out. Scared the hell out of me
The Editor did an OUTSTANDING job here and we should thank them.  Garnt's precise narrative timed with flowing transitions and cuts and an audio mix that must have outnumbered the video clips.  I am thoroughly impressed.
8:53 Inner Light goes well with everything.....just sayin.
man you are a beast! Loved the video❤
4:14 Birdie Wing 5:10 Ya Boy Kongming 6:51 Lycoruis Recoil 8:14 Aoashi and Blue Lock  9:47 Call of the Night 10:55  Summer Time Rendering 12:14 Demon Slayer 13:32 Spy x Family 14:36 Mobile Suit Gundam the Witch from Mercury 16:37 Kaguya-sama: Love is War 18:21 Chainsaw Man 20:28 Bocchi The Rock 22:53 Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 24:25 Mob Psycho 100 25:57 Made in Abyss
I was hoping to watch a vid about anime and yet again my country is used as a joke. This is why i watch gigguk
Made in mid
demid slayer is literally in the middle of the list aye
yesss made in abyss was by far the best anime of 2022
As an Italian, I'm still proud of Tifa's invasion in our senate and I must say the sauce never tasted any better
For me Love is War season 3 was just perfect so I got to give it anime of the year
Football>Soccer
Gundam has always had a little bit of magic in addition to the technology (Newtypes and whatnot), but some of the tech in Witch From Mercury _seems magical_ in a way that I just don't really like.
For me, the best thing in 2022 was Katawa Shoujo, I know that this isn't an anime and came out a long time ago, but I only found  about it thanks to your video. I experienced the whole range of emotions while passing it and return in again and again.
Still can't bring myself to watch Made in Abyss Movie 2 & 3 because of Season 1's Emotional Damage it dealt to me
Made in Abyss is a fantastic example of the sublime. An emotion described in philosophy as the feeling of fear, terror and pain, whilst also holding a sense of pleasure and joy.
27:00 non euclidean?
where was bleach😂
Even though it was towards the end, I'm happy Lycoris Recoil was on this list. It was my personal highlight of 2022. I really really hope there will be a continuation.
Big sad for not bringing the Moroccan team while talking about World cup ;-;
I don't know if I'm crazy but how was Chainsaw Man not ranked higher, if not #1. In my eyes, after reading the manga, I felt like it was a pretty perfect adaptation with nothing holding it back. The music, va, animation, story felt extremely high quality for the whole runtime.
Man is unhinged off his rocker absolutely cracked with this video Jesus
Well I actually fell out of my chair when he said my name.
uuh you made it, already feared you'd drop it this time
wtf its 3:13 rn how did he know?
Nice video, I enjoy
I cant wait for jjk season 2 but i am gonna be scarred again by this season but even though i will need to re live this nightmare i will cherish it.
Song at 27:44?
Absolute godly ranking of all the god tier animes last year, especially difficult in the top 5, but loved them all.
That was a great list dude. Thanks for always putting so much effort into these videos!   I am pretty sure there are a ton of people out there who appreciate the emotional take you provide with your selections. Enough so that they have someone they can relate to.  Keep up the fantastic work man!
This was a great year, I had so much fun watching all these animes and more, really helped me after a long day of studying.  Have to say though, I really need to start the series Made in Abyss.  I feel like I am solely missing out on that one
Funny enough the thing I relate to Bocchi is that she spends most of her time in the closet...
Really well done and entertaining vid
its 3:42am
25:56 My heart skipped a beat when I heard the first few notes! Holy shit that almost made me cry, I'm not even joking!
Hey Gigguk where would you rank bleach TYBW
It's videos like these that remind me that actual people play the music we hear in the background. TWFM gundam music is so good, and the sound design is perfect
Out of SEVENTEEN only "My Dress-up Darling" deserves a spot in the top. Dislike for not including a single isekai. I thought Grant is a trash connoisseur, one of us, and he's betrayed us
My favorite was mob psycho^^
Not a single isekai? Gigguk is growing up <3 (I'm a sucker for isekais)
Boch
you just had to finish with 3 top gut wrenching heartbreak shows. Thanks for opening a wound just when I've finally forgotten it.
gigguk you're a genius
i guess im not really clear on how chainsaw man didn't live up to the expectations.
Im happy that Kaguya-sama got to 6th place, and mob 2nd
WHY DONT YOU PUT UP THE NAME AGAIN AFTER YOU EXPLAINED WHY ITS GOOD? Now I either need to write down each name just in case it sounds interesting or jump back after deciding that it's worth a place on my plan to watch list. Just make our life's easier by having the name card while not for the entire summary at least once or when you're done talking about ut
Did this guy really just bait people with Watamote? There is no character progression there. Only pain.
God damn. What a great video.
Gundamn
2023 we're going to have Farmland Saga, Dr. Stone s3, Jujutsu Kaisen s2, Nier Automata (if the hiatus is not going to be long), Trigun Stampede, Solo Leveling, Undead Unluck, Sand Land and we already have Kaiju No.8 for 2024
Cyberpunk was for normies
no one piece :(
12:11 wait this was pay locked? i guess my pirate skills are too high, well, i'm not gonna tell any of you the website i use, don't want to get it shut down, i had to search very hard to find it, since they changed their website name, i had to jump through alot of hoops, including finding my old computer to find out the websites name, then googlefu the search engine to find out the new name, you can't find the site if you just search "anime sites" or if you misspell the name, this is my deserved safe viewing experience, it also doesn't have ads.
bro that comment about Belgium and germany was personal AF
Sport anime is as bad as idol anime. You can't change my mind.
Only one Isekai? I'm a bit surprised, ngl. Still a great list! An incredible year for anime, and IMO, one of the strongest years ever for anime.
24:16 fuk u i cried again
I hate when u eat bokksu 😡 they dont come to my country, i mean they reach Brazil and Peru BUT NOT BOLIVIA IM RIGHT ON MIDDLE OF THOSE 2 COUNTRIES!!! TOTALLY UNFAIR
my name is liam
all i have to say is.. great fucking video
Gigguk's editing is so good it made me right a comment.
8:53 did anyone else notice hajime no ippo
The X is not pronounced, in neither Spy x Family nor in Hunter x Hunter. There is no discussion to have that's just how it is officially.
cyberpunk's last episode gave me an anxiety attack
To another year of highly cultured endeavors🥂 Oppai
Flawless list. Summertime Rendering is on Hulu too for those without Disney + BTW
Your list was so great, and the video so well made. In my opinion 2022 was a great year with lots of good shows, let’s hope 2023 will be as good as 2022!
This year I lost my love for anime series, I used to be able to binge series and watched several shows a month. But now I can’t even sit down to watch 2 or more episodes. I hope to get my excitement back this year.
For real I was wondering if you gonna mention Made in Abyss and by the end you have put a smile on my face.
27:00 is that supposed to be "non-Euclidian?" I have never heard the word "usidian" in my life
Gundam witch from mercury was literally my first legit mecha and can recommend it for sure, I gotta watch more after that.
TrashTaste Grant: Sakura flavour is mid. Gigguk Garnt: This tastes amazing!  xD
Gay girls init
Goldbridge is the gift that keeps on giving 😂
Nice
So happy to see edgerunners in the top 3, and yeah your top 6 are basically interchangeable
Garnt always nails this kind of videos, it really makes me keep wanting to watch anime. Congrats man, you really deserve your success!
Tbh i think anime call of night made bad job at giving that vibe of night, while the manga were so awesome that i cant belive they are the same thing.
19:32 Himeno fans 💀💀
finally
Having the brains to not only describe each show in a genius way, but to also include memes that give me hope not all humour is ruined (achem...tiktok). It's amazing to say the least.  Also I'm happy Made in Abyss is at no. 1. Surely a deserving spot for an anime that "gives you experience like no other if you're brave enough"
Hey...  Congrats on getting married, bro!
I forgot how good Kevin Penkin was, god damn
It's fucking 3 rn Garnt wth!
kinda sad that bleach didnt make it into the top 10
OH MY GOD! Someone else heard the "alternative lyrics" for "Venus Line"?!? LFG!!!
Gigguk doing his best angel beats impression by dropping TWO of the "cry now" songs.
This is what the anime awards should be, new anime that got released during the year competing in each category not season 2 3 4 5 6 competing and getting anime of the year seasons should have their own category or should only be a nominee for a maximum amount of times there were so many hidden gems this year and they didn't get a chance to shine thank you gigguk for giving us a proper showing of some of the best anime this year (except for bleach not being on the list 💀 I fr think you could've just left out the 1 extra soccer anime that everyone skipped and watched blue locke over)
Where's Sonny Boy?!
Made in Abyss Season 1 got me to read the Manga ahead of where it left off and I still wasn't prepared for how hard Season 2 hit me.
Nice list and ever but n 1 it should have been bleach (my opinion that’s true)
i hated watching ao ashi but the manga is 30x better for some reason
Man was there some incredible anime this year.  Man, I loved season three of Kaguya Sama…..and that wasn’t my favorite of the year.
i would rather get a second circumcision than go through the pain of made in abys
Liam, if you're out there, go to bed.
As a Liam, that joke landed PERFECTLY LMAO
Wish Kingdom was also mentioned in the list
Made in abyss is a masterpiece I feel like more people should watch it  Story time was have a boring day at my job a sit to watch season 2 of the anime and 1 of the episodes was watching I just started to cry it’s a show like no other
"Bocchi the Peak"
I introduced a new coworker to Anime by recommending Made in Abyss. That Anime is such a masterpiece, she turned full on weeb now and is eagerly awaiting recommendations that have the same level !   She also loves Demon Slayer now XDD
No way Grant didn't include jojo's. That's ain't true.
Made in Abyss got me back into anime. Season 2 was well worth the wait and now I find myself constantly checking the news for when we get more.
It's not numbers 9 to 1. It's 9 number 1s.
Boccher is not number 1? I'm literally shaking and crying rn I cannot believe Gigguk would betray me like this  (fr fairly decent list... I still need to watch Made in Abyss)
I usually don't really care about stuff like fanfics,shipping etc but FCK,Spy X Family made me care🤧
i actually am shocked that lycoris or dress up darling weren't higher, damn.
Love the editing on Gigguk's videos. Funny , interesting,  imaginative. I veven shared occasionally tear here and there. Emotional Damage !!!
These transitions remind me why you’re the biggest anime YouTuber around.
10:14 wtf its really 3:am rn what a coincidence
Chainsaw Man and Demon Slayer is a piece of crap
i love anime man, but i think i love you more
So what we got? GAY GIRLS
The classic intro song to Gigguk's "best of" series is missing. It makes me super sad.
Our boy forgot the real number 1 - Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo/Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World
Coming back at 3am to upvote the comment Liam leaves after being called out...
Man garnt I'm gonna say that is by far one of the best lists you ever made and anime's mentioned here truly deserve their spot! Can't wait for more reviews like this.
borf.
No 1 totally deserved! I love your videos!
this list is kinda bad on my opinion.  but don't have something against it as an opinion, thanks for vid btw
this really was an absolute banger of a year of anime, great video Grant!
I have eaten a tomato today. Do you all like tomatoes? Guys?
Wow you just described kaguya sama in the most poetic way it could be
Chaisaw man 5 ?? Cmoon it should be at top 3 at least
man this is weird that am getting emotionally moved by anime and not real life
Manga is better.
Gay girls innit?
"gay girls innit" makes every series better.
your editing is god tier
Made In Abyss deserve to be number 1 this year, i may have enjoyed watching other anime but this one had a deeper impact in my opinion.
Bro, I can't describe Made in Abyss in any way but criminally underrated. It's a level of sadness and character development yet to be matched🥲.
love ur vid gigguk ty
Demon slayer but not bleach ???
Can someone tell me what this anime is at 1:27 with the wales? It looks beautiful.
Bros crazy for not adding bleach
19:20 Ridiculous. Power's ***way*** too old for a Smash player.
After watching made in abyss, i wished i had never watched it. I hated it, really i did. 1. It does not matter how high quality any media is if there is no coherence its chaos and i dont mean beautiful or incredible chaos i mean ugly. 2. Without coherence its not memorable for what it actually was. when this came up as number 1 i just had a gag reflex and the thought of i dont wanna do this again. 3. Children are exploited in a way thats worse than rape and the main character acts as if shes cool with it. 4. The Abyss is literally a spinoff of Hell... why would you want to be there?
Wtf bleach blood wars where the f it was the best shonan this year its 100% payoff and action
This solidified gigguk to me as a man of proper culture having Marin of My Dress Up as best girl of 2022. Stay golden my guy.
The secret of every great anime    Gay girls in it
12:25 isn't it season 3 because the movie was freeza'd into a season 2 ?
FINALLY SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT BIRDIE WINGS
Massive W for putting Made in abyss season 2 at first place, watching it was truly a once per lifetime unique experience
lol those "Himeno fans" sent me lmao also, seems the secret ingredient is gay girls!
10:08 It's actually 3 AM for me rn 😂
Cloverworks really popped off this year
The goldbridge cameo 🤣
I had a friend call it Spy times Family
That Made in Abyss feeling is a gut twisting feeling, you feel something isn't quite right about this magical place before they hit you with something you could never imagine, something that is so utterly horrifing yet fits perfectly in the pit. There is only one other thing that has giving such a unknown feeling, that is Omori, and its a game you have to go 100% blind into.
Yes, I'm sorry but, Marin still Best Girl
Cyberpunk 1st you noob you
Still haven't watched Chainsaw Man, but the absolute thirst for Makima is honestly starting to worry me. I read 14 chapters of the manga. Just how down bad are y'all???
Me watching the vid and garnt say "3am" Check the clock: 2:55 am Fk
bocchi the rock is my top pick from 2022 and yeah, maririn is the best waifu
Just wait for gear 5 One Piece this year
Lol pirates have no restrictions
Summer time rendering and MiA 2 are the greatest animes of this year, nothing else to be said about it
I can't blame the need to make a glorified AMV at the end of the Gundam section.
Have you ever seen anime named another if so whatt are your thoughts?
The Goldbridge clip lol
Where is Bleach my Boy?
As a Liam that cut me deep bro
8:30 Gigguk and Mark Goldbridge are not things I thought I would ever say in the same sentence😂
man I ain't even a weeb and this man still managed to get me hooked on this video
where is i am atomic ???????????????????
Never in my life would I have thought I would see Mark Goldbridge and Danny Aarons in a Gigguk video
Overlord season 4?
ah yes the video Ive been waiting for!
The God of narrative and script writting did it again Amazing video, Gigguk
What anime is number 14
What a great video. I'm happy I have watched all those anime's. Personally, I would swap the order of some of them but to each their own.
Honestly, this season of Kaguya is legit one of the best anime I have watched. If you haven't watched it, do it.
10:16 FOR FUCK SAKE HE ACTUALLY GOT MY NAME RIGHT! Though it’s currently only 9pm for me so it’s not THAT late.
Made in Abyss is one of my favorite anime, if not the anime. The way the visuals, the acting and music come together to make you feel such complex feelings. Old Stories still makes me feel achingly nostalgic. Gravity always feels like the beginning of a grand adventure. It's just such a masterclass of tone and emotion.
Spy family on 8? sus
garnt... how can a wife and husband be blood related?
Gantz the modern shakespeare
Can't disagree with any of that list.
God dang it grant, every single time, can u please stop messing with my emocional every video? I gotta keep my sanity u know?
Sumertime Renderer is on HULU as well. I repeat HULU. Still gotta watch adds unless you pay those premium prices, but fuck em, it was amazing.
Love the mark Goldbridge memes scattered around the video 😂 and the entire World Cup part
YEAH BABY GUNDAM IS IN DA HOUSE
this list felt different, it hit different
Gugguk I hate you man... U keep putting out these banger videos every year causing me to put a bunch of new shows on my PTW list only for me to watch the list grow ever longer instead of the actual shows
Made in Abyss taught us one thing. Don't drink the fucking water!
lets go Made in Abyss goated sosu
Mid year
Great Video man! Thank you!
Thank you for having made in abyss as your number 1. No one is talking about it and it deserves so much more attention.
dont even watch anime. just here 4 garnt
Awesome Video Cried a few times thank you Garnt
If uni gigguk could see these videos......
Didn't even feel like a 30 minute video, holy cow! Garnt, you make the best videos I swear.
Lmao using the three kingdoms clip
do i need to watch the movie Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei to understand Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou
Not even mentioning Akiba Maid War for this list is criminal
absolutely based pick for #1
As an American, I wish I could stroll around the city but a I can’t because—  *gun cocking behind my head*  I-I’m just tired….yeah that’s it. Tired
Love the background link click OST.
out of the 3 years that i witnessed in terms of anime (2020-2022) that last year was probably the best for me, if we talk about anime that came out in that year. it was a very hard hitting year with anime like chainsaw man, mob , made in abyss, kaguya sama, and many more, but in paticular Bocchi, my Anime of the Year. This video btw nearly made me cry, very nostalgic and emotional.
Cyberpunk 2077 has been fixed for along time, give it a chance yall
*Gordon Ramsay: what's the twist. Girl: breast milk Spits it out
The REAL Anime Awards is here!!!
I used to easily cry when I see emotional scenes. But as a punishment for watching too much anime in a short period, it has now become harder to feel moved at the climax of a story. Even then Gigguk's videos always manage to make a wave of dopamine, a sensation of pleasure wash over while also making me laugh at times. This guy knows what he's doing when he's writing his script, no less editing the video. Great job mate, you're the only one that gets me waiting for your next video.
Mark goldbridge and Danny arrons in a gigguk video never thought I see the day
I loved the video but bleach not even in top 17? Really?
Hearing old stories at the first place is making me shivering. God I love Made in abyss so much.
himeno fans are all drowning in copium
I didn't watch every anime in 2022 but the ones I did watch I loved. Cyberpunk edgerunners was a gut punch of a series, spy × family was so dang fun, chainsaw man hit me like a truck of pure awesomeness, reincarnated as a sword really surprised me as someone who grew tired of isekai but it really became one my favorites by how enjoyable it was and really changed my feelings towards isekai in general, gundam is my favorite anime franchise and TWFM was a fantastic return for the franchise which makes me happy how many new commers are enjoying it, and with bocchi the rock being one of the most relatable series I saw. Really, I haven't had a year line up this great in a while since 2015 personally and I greatly enjoyed it.
Please never stop making videos here. Thank you.
I'm Glad Bocchi got as high  as it did, though I think Garnt didn't touch on something that helps to elevate Bocchi: The attention to detail both with animation and story. You don't just see anime characters handling instruments and music plays, you see the characters *playing* the instruments. Every chord, every drumbeat, every bassline; all of it is animated with an attention to detail that boggles the mind. And the story is one that is so true to the life of a small, starting musician, that it has been praised for exactly that by so many people.   I liked a great many anime this year, and many of the ones Gigguk mentioned are also among my favourites, but Bocchi, for me, is by far the best one I watched. For all the reasons he mentioned, and for the ones he did not.
While I don't always agree with the choice placement, I can always see where you're coming from and can see how others may be your favorite, BUT NUMBER 5 CMON
truly the year of "gay girls innit"
As a super smash bros player i disagree with the power joke
Bro idc if you took a month to make this, this is some amazing work and I loved watching it
That mark goldbridge crossover had me😂
I was smiling ear to ear through out this video, we ate good this year
Gigguk describes anime like how Gordon Ramsay describes food, and I love him for it
Thank you for giving Made in Abyss so much love!  I swear Kevin Penkin knows how to make an emotional soundtrack. Made in Abyss just hits different from any other anime of last year
Kaguya really was insane
Banger video as always
I grew up with a staple of “normie” anime like Dragonball, Naruto, Doraemon, and Detective Conan. Due to bullying issues and a lack of interest I skipped the entirety of 2010s anime and missed out some greats that I only watched back thanks to Trash Taste and old animetuber videos. So far, 2022 was a GREAT year for anime enjoyers just because of the sheer amount of bangers dropping out and becoming instant classics. Fresh concepts and premises like Spy x Family, Ya Boy Kongming and My Dress-Up Darling among the sea of typical isekai and shounen anime just shows how massive the anime as a medium is when people are willing to adapt manga/LN not seen elsewhere. Seriously, 2022 was a GREAT year for entertainment and despite some personal trauma associated with loss of loved ones I’d still remember how good and kind it was for us. Thanks for the amazing and classy summary, Garnt.   Btw, I know it’s a common joke with Marin, but she’s genuinely a great female character deserving the “Best Girl of 2022” title just because of how she’s portrayed.
The like button of this comment shall now represent every Liam that got called out.
This man’s Consistency !
Gigguk these are the videos I look forward to every year because in one video you are able to express so many emotions flawlessly while displaying to Anime newcomers what this media is about
Well. The first place is not watchable in Germany. … But I got the manga!
Lycoris Recoil gave us a new type of CGDCT: "Cute Girls Doing State Sanctioned Extrajudicial Homicide"
Thank you
No Bleach?
YEEE MADE IN ABYSS
Spy Cross Product Family Spy Cartesian Product Family
when he said best rapper since Eminem I cringed unironically knowing JID exists
So happy Gundam is included!
Thats the thing about made in abyss, you cant really describe it in a way to properly convey what the charm of the story feels like, therefor making it hard to convince people to watch it. Its a feeling thats just not Comparable with any other show. People that haven't watched it will look on it not seeing what the show really is about and wonder what is so special about it, but those that watched it know it
4:17 wtf bro, but birdie wing was such a good anime
SHE SAID GRANT
Was wondering when u would do a review or something. Ur shit is getting wrecked with sideprojects
Summer time rendering is such an underrated anime, glad it got some recognition. I've been sleeping on made in abyss because I wanted to make time to binge it, and now I can't wait to get into it
Ahhh yes, Gay Girls, what everything needs
Ah man as usual your end of the year video is a an absolute masterpiece of a video essay and felt so short. Much love and look forward to your next work! Take care!
1: Made in Abyss (if it keeps this quality until its end, the manga/anime is going to be my favourite of all time) 2: Mob 100 S3 3: SpyXFamily 4: Chainsaw Man (Gigguk is right, this is just the beginning) 5: Demon Slayer Honestly, you can put 2-5 in the same spot, I love them equally. There are other shows like Kaguya S3, Iruma etc...
Whenever i see one of anime related videos, I'm always mesmerized by your incredible writing talent and comedic timing, and I always find myself agreeing with you, only to watch the latest Trash Taste episode where you squander it all with another flaming hot take. Love it, never change.
man called me out for watching this at 3 am and then convinced me to watch the witch from Mercury and then made me regret dropping made in abyss maaaaaaaaaaaaaan
As always... Thanks for the ride Garnt
Any Maid Sama Fans here?
yeah, Made in Abyss is special
gigguk i swear im not awake at 3 am
blue lock is prob first after the last 4 episodes bro
Summer time rendering = best anime 2022, had me on the edge of my seat. Soooo maannnyyyyy PLOT TWIIIIISTSSOSDJLKADJ:SAdasds  Edit: actually idk i forgot demon slayer came out 2022 as well.... Summer time rendering = Anime that was new in 2022 & finished in 2022....there  Edit again: FK i just realized cyberpunk came out that year too,,,
My favorite anime of the year probably of all time is Bocchi but I agree the top 3 deserves their spot.
Was Hungry Heart: Wild Striker not a football anime about a greedy striker?
12:39 "If actions speak louder than words, DS is f_ckin screaming"  Now that's a HARD PUNCHLINE. I'm totally reusing it someday in my life 🔥🔥
what a banger video my man
hoLY SHIT WAS THIS A GREAT YEAR FOR ANIME.  We had Summer Time Rendering. I loved it SO much. It made me tear up just remembering it...I need to go watch the last episode again.
great video but the list ... yikes ... no aot is just sad
Ma  i love this year of anime and this content!
This has been one of the best videos of all time. Thanks you the stacked year of anime, gigguks meme game has stepped up so high that you'd need some bigger freaking shoes to do it again.
Blue lock no diff
I'm just happy garnt actually recognized mob psycho for once and didn't gloss over it with a single sentence praising it i never thought the day would come 😭😭😭😭
Makima reminds me of my ex.
#14 We all know this is here because Garnt cannot separate his personal feelings from his professional life.
made in abyss deserves a 10/10
I had such LOW expectations for Witch from Mercury. I don't like gundam, or even giant robots in general, but I loved that shit
You put into words the indescribable feeling I had while watching Made In Abyss. This anime is really something else
Always well spoken Gigguk, i love listening the way you speak about anime how you put everything into words.  Keep it up
I would love to see a Gigguk video on the World Cup.
Last year was just a banger
8:27 as a weeb/football fan glad to see Mark Goldbridge as well
Great video, and congrats on getting married!!!💒
Goldbridge was the last person I expected to see in this video
NO JOJO? ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
Made in Abyss truly is a hidden gem
how did you know Garnt ,gart ,grant that my name was Liam and its 3 am
Man, I really have to finish watching, like, half of these.
No Bleach?
Bro, 2022 was so packed, I forgot that the Tifa porn was played in an Italian senate session. What a year
Bleach was my first anime. It was really hard to watch kubo's decent as a creator when his vision began to get exploited and there's something so alive in the recent season, the same kind of life that kubo put into the very first season and i'm just so glad they took time away to bring back what made bleach so good in the first place. i think sometimes people forget how god damn good it was.
W list for bocchi in top 5
Fucking fantastic writing and editing. Also I demand Sydney voice Marin. I will sell a soul to make this happen. Not mine mind you, I traded that for One Punch Man Season 2 and we saw the quality that bought us. But I'll find one.
Bleach not in? Come on, you can do better.
Ok now how is Bleach not even here it is easily top 3
babe wake up new gigguk best of anime video !!
The thing about chainsawman is that the anime only adapted one third of the first part of chainsawman and that is the weakest part it only gets crazier and deeper from there
Man grant removed the classic intro.. I'm so sad that I won't have a chance to hear that for the year 2022.
i haven't been tracking anime nearly as much and honestly, i hadnt even head about some of these. feels bad for the analytics since i had to skip like half of the recs that i now plan to watch
I liked this year and video, but 2021 can't be beaten in both Anime and the gigguk best anime video.
chainsaw man was the most mid anime and the manga is sub-par imo, iam aware i have the wrong opinion but hey
Made in Abyss s2 literally made me go look for a support group for the trauma
If you thought Netflix killed Jojo stone Ocean hype, boi here in Germany we still have no legal way to watch bleach thousand years blood war arc since Disney decided to just buy the license and don't give us anything, not even sub
Where it AOT??
I literally couldn't even tell it wasn't Marin
Listen, i dont wanna be one of those guys, but Bleach??
Seeing all the clips of Made In Abyss literally had me in tears again seeing all those moments play out again. It was such a chillingly beautiful Season and easily one of my top shows this year as well.  Happy New Year Garnt & Everyone and here's to another genre defying year!!!
I'm a casual anime fan. I'm hard into a few shows or I just want to watch some cool animation. I don't think I have ever watched as much as 2022. The October season in particular was just mind blowing. And I haven't even seen half of the shows he listed here
8:15 These animes were 1000x better cuz of the World Cup, and esp. Japan’s incredible World Cup campaign
Yippee
I remember watching the episode of Made in Abyss where they revealed the cure to their sickness, and I thought that it was the must horrifying most twisted thing I've ever seen, and all done because of a conglomeration of wishes.
i should’ve seen it coming but i still broke down INSTANTLY into violent sobbing 24:16
The king has returned
Made in Abyss was phenomenal. It was an emotional gut punch like no other.
Made in abyss just those something, idk what it is the is
MIA one of my favorites. Its has such a powerful story.  Even though its dark and horrific. The hope for longing and adventure is what keeps us and the characters going.  Thanks again Gigguk for another great year of anime content.
I genuinely respect his views and opinions, cuz he feels like the Gordon Ramsay of weebs at this point. Hard to disagree with basically
This is why I consider myself a follower of the isekai man. Wouldn't have discovered and be hooked if it wasnt because of these videos. Thanks Mr. Animezone!
No gay girls in LycoReco either, mate. But insane amount of editing and prowess on this video, like always
wheres bleach
My guy, this may legitimately be one of the best videos you've ever made.  Thank you.
I hadn't heard of Ya Boy Kongming until I heard the OP and then I watched it and holy shit it was amazing. Such a ridiculous concept but it was such an amazingly well told story.
28:58 what's the name of that song?
Its worth living another year just to watch the Best of Anime 2023
So made in Abyss reached level of end of Eva existential crysis level? Please tell because same thing people said for Eva that it can't be recommended to anyone and everybody.
Wait but there are gay girls in Bocchi the Rock, just not main characters. Redhead joined the group because Ryo-senpai is sooooo cooooool
I don't think I can put into words just HOW GOOD gundam the witch from mercury is. You just did. Idk man, I just can't stop screaming at everyone to watch it- I've never been like that before lmao.
these 'best of anime' videos are the best anime videos on youtube
Where the Attack on titan tho?
Let's Gooooo
Thanks 2022 for proving that everything is better with gay girls in it (Japan)
Summertime Rendering and Bocchi the rock in top 10 let’s goooooooo!!!
What is the song he used for made in abyss?
Gigguk is the *Giga man* of Anime YT community
Summer time rendering is now on Hulu
I really think Ao Ashi was way too overshadowed by Blue lock
You explained the second season of made and abyss 2 so well. Haunting/ terrifying g without scaring you. I was trying to tell a friend about why I felt so messed up afterward and I couldn't quite convey it. But I'm glad you're haunted too lol
No love for Akiba maid wars?  Boooo
As a jojo fan i feel that love is war should be put higher :)
Gay girls innit.
I've seen maybe 4 of these lol (I have Chainsaw man and Edgerunners on near perma hold)
I don't understand how Gigguk is this good at describing anime, there is only one word to describe his talent... wow
9:20 Best World cup Joke I've heard yet
holy fuck 2022 was stacked
meanwhile people forgot Black Rock Shooter Dawn Fall exists because Disney+ jail.
https://youtu.be/xXmXM0qRMbo?t=875 Borf
Spy multiplied by family is such a crisp show
Caught me off gaurd when he said liam.. :)
Oh please! Ash finally winning a pokemon league was forced and not earned! He literally had plot armor and was 100% chances of winning no matter what kind of fucking YOUTUBE strategy he used. We are talking about the damn YOUTUBE of ASH! We aren't talking of Satoshi/red  but damn worthless YOUTUBE ASH! The same YOUTUBE who threw a Pikachu to an onyx and won cause main character plot armor, the same damn YOUTUBE who literally drops his lv 60/70/80 team SO HE CAN START ALL OVER AGAIN WITH LOW LEVEL POKEMON! then the damn YOUTUBE wonders why those lv 90 pokemon in the pokemon league mop his team in which his strongest Pokemon is lv 60 and somehow his YOUTUBE PIKACHU GOES BACK TO LV 5 IN EVERY SINGLE NEW REGION! THAT STUPID RAT SHOULD BE LV 500 BY NOW AND THAT DOESNT MAKE SENSE! THATS HOW DAMN YOUTUBE IT IS FOR IT TO BE WEAK IN EVERY NEW BEGINNING!
A noticable increase of yuri couples in anime. Interesting.
I'm so salty! I somehow missed Summer Time Rendering, then you said it was because it was lost to Disney+ (which explains how I missed it), so I went over to signup for 1 month.   You can't preview what they have, so I blindly paid the money & searched for the series. No results... I then do some digging & find out it's on *HULU* (in the US), so I ended up paying another $15 just to sign back up with Hulu too! *I BLAME YOU!!!* 🤬🤬🤬  Though I'm only blaming you because otherwise I'd have to accept responsibility, and you know... I don't like that idea 🤣
I hope we get another season of Made in (Peak)Abyss in the next 5 - 10 years.
I CANT BELIEVE YOU PUT A FUCKING CHINESE DRAMA CLIP LMAOOOO
Gigguk's top 6 are the real nomis for anime of the year, not the popular contest from crunchyroll
You really got a point on kaguya sama it’s now a modern classic and a lot of people will begin romance by this absolute masterpiece.
im suprised that there is no Eminence in Shadow
Midway thorugh I realized you were actually ranking the shows xD Crap, guess I will watch it again then 😌😏  Edit: this listing is great for me, it's almost the same top as mine with the exception of Made in Abyss, and that's only because I didn't watch it yet, I am keeping it for future because it looks stallar and Kevin has done an amazing soundtrack for it, what I am saying is that I am looking forward to savour every second of it xD  Also no isekais it seems, I dislike the genre only because it feels bankrupt of any new ideas or inspiration, but it makes me sad that none of them raised the stakes in any way thes year. Maybe next year...
Made in Abyss gives me vibes like it's from the same Universe as Oban Star Racer I know, you might say: wtf it doesn't get even close But for me it does, and I love it
For me Bocchi won... No other show made me so emotional, so motivated and so incredibly humble. Bocchi will be the show I remember all my life.... Because like Ryu said: "Most people won't get it. But a few it will touch very deeply".
witch of mercury, is chef's kiss
Wow it's already been a year huh. It feels like yesterday when I was hyped to watch gigguks best of anime 2021 video
I am definitely a casual anime watcher and can't always find new things that motivate me to want to watch it, but Gigguk's video are my life line to go out and really watch new forms of entertainment. Thank you Gigguk. Love you<3
At last my yearly gude to anime, thank u and Joey theanimeman for helpin me with anime, have a good one bro!
call of the night is mid
Bleach? Attack on Titan? Mxm
The best (new) anime of 2022 for me is Summertime Render, an anime with a great story and unexpected and shocking events, with excellent production and directing. An anime that makes you stand on your nerves all the time while watching. It deserves, in my personal opinion, 9.5/10. And it is also one of the most underrated anime of 2022.
He fucking nails it EVERYTIME
Fuck... i still wasnt ready to hear Cyberpunk song...
Gigguk is probably the only creator I know who can make a 30 minute long video and have me hooked the entire time. The ways you craft the stories and narratives into one cohesive and flowing video is beautiful, Keep up the wonderful work,      Grant
why was this video so good?             gay girls innit.
Love is war wasnt that good, i mean ok its nice to have a conclusion but visually it was horrible
The editing during the chainsaw man section was next level 😂 This guy really knows how to make you immersed in his videos
My top 3 were Edgerunners, SpyxFamily and Made in Abyss.
Oh no, you didn't put AOT or Jojo on here... You should be careful sleeping tonight, the AOT- and Jojo-fans aren't gonna be happy. Good video though.
すてき
For me kaguya doen't enter the top 15
Never watched Edgerunners since someone described the ending plot suddenly in a conversation but at least I can still enjoy the song this way.
Weeb
Bocchi the Rock was suprising. I'll add it
Glad the FIFA World cup was able to secure such a high spot on the list, truly one of the best anime of the year
Somebody give that editor a raise
8 fukking ads + the sponsorship lik  bro ok u need to eat but chill
Birdie Wing was a surprise to be because I hate golf, so much... and that show was incredible
God, upon hearing MiA soundtrack all my hair stood up instantly. Like goosebumps gone super saiyan
You forgot to mention one thing about Witch From Mercury: it gets pretty dark at times. Although if the rumors I’ve heard about Mobile Suit Victory Gundam are true, I probably haven’t seen anything yet!
Another W video
​i love love love gigguk videos, he expresses his view of anime so well. You're just lost in his words + he funny
Yo this is in January 2023 nice! Was expecting this near July lol. But either way glad to see a new gigguk video. These best of the year ones are always my favorites because it allows me to see new anime I missed our during the year
The chainsaw man and cyberpunk transitions gave me chills
Edgerunners fucked me up so much
Gigguk is a gem and we need to protect this anime treasure of a man
In Calculus the x symbol is actually used for cross product so, "Spy cross product Family" is the most correct way. mathematically that is.
gigguk video 🙏 best birthday gift
Paripi Koumei is my favorite anime of the year, and I don't know why. It's the only anime I've ever seen twice in the same week
Garnt have you been watching anything of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These? A new season of that released in two cours during 2022 and it was pretty great!
Top 6 for me  1.  Chainsaw man  2. Demon slayer  3. Welcome to demon school season 3  4.Spy X family  5. Cyberpunk edgerunners  6.My dress up darling Still haven’t seen the new Gundam series but will get to it within time or season 6 of My hero.
That Boeing 747 joke absolutely killed me lmao
What I love about Blue Lock, it is basically a football battle shonen.  Just think about it. Each player has a unique weapons which make them far better then MC. So MC has to grind, acquire new skills and level up.
Yeah, but Chainsaw Man doesn't have gay girls, innit ?
this is wildest video ever coz i never thought that someday angry rantman would be in gigguks video
garnt ha become too good at this. he needs a challenge.
Qatar World Cup anime of the year
21:53 GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Made in abyss is fucking based
Mark Goldbridge in a Gigguk video is one of the craziest things I've ever seen
Trust me, I am literally watching this video at 3 am. 10:01
I wonder when Guan Yu is gonna appear if we do get a s2 of Ya Boy Kongming
Fuck Messi, Pelé the greatest of ALL time, rest in peace, king.
You should have shown the tweet replies of Emiru's cosplay for Makima.
best video to come out on my birthday
I'm glad Gundam is here. Witch from mercury had the hypest moments for me. I can eat my tomatoes in peace now🍅🍅
Am I the only one who doesn't really like Makima much?
Damn no mention of Attack on Titan part 2 in list of 17? Damn, rip
best part about this list is that there is no Bleach lmao
The call of the night is an anime that gave me an atmosphere of peace, and brought me back to the times when there was no shelling, no curfew and you could calmly walk around the city at any hour. damn russians
8:25 Mark Goldbridge making it into the video. The legend himself
SO FUCKING FOR S3 OF DEMON SLAYER ITS COMING OUT ON SECOND OF THE THIRD OR THE OPPSITE I DONT REMEBER
I know these videos take a lot of work to make having to not only script but also to watch almost every show that comes out every season so thanks for all your hard work, we definitely appreciate it
Does someone the name of the music in 29:00
Definitely one of the best anime channels.  Another great video on one of our favorite subjects.
I'm thankful that garnt is an anime fan!
Very good vid garnt but where's ur genshin stream
Was wondering when it would appear sosu
One of my fav youtuber
Gonna watch this with Asmongold.
Arcane is the secret #0
Attack on Titan understood the assignment to JUST NOT END
music at 23:22 - Cyberwildlife Park by Marcin Przybylowicz
Get Girls In It
This was such a great year for anime. So many bangers. Glad Fall anime were recognized after crunchyroll shafted them to next year
I'm the same as Bocchi but not as anxious. I can relate to everything in the anime except the japanese school and fest.
Grant is my favorite YouTuber
Congrats on getting Married Gigguk!!! 😁
finally... it is here
what is that green thing at the end of the video? it was very hard to catch and it doesn't seem like anything.
This video was a banger Garnt, Grant uuhm, Garnt!
nothing beats made in abyss for me
Man I really wish i had enjoyed Cyberpunk more, it was like a 6/10 for me and felt too predictable to be enjoyable to me. I like the vibe of the music and animation but the characters i just didn't care one bit about.
Uhh, idk, Mob Psycho 100 season 3 was kind of like pure suffering for me. They probably should have just made it some sort of epilogue episode and cut out all the fluff.
Made in Abyss is fluffy abuse in HD
The most anticipated vid of January 🔥
so basically to sum it up, it was aaall Ä$$ got it
This year I mostly cared for sequels and barely bothered with the new stuff even in Fall (Spring for me in this southern hemisphere). The new shows were fine I just didn't care enough.  Devil is a Part Timer S2, DAL S5, Komi S2. Takagi S3.  May or may not Do It Yourself I need to catch up on. Uzaki S2 was maybe better than S1. Married more than Lovers or whatever it's called have yet to finish. Probably others in past seasons I was too sequel busy to care I'll have to catch up on. I only can focus on 1-3 shows each session unless it's from my backlog.
Wow, most amazing top. I will watch all anime in 2022
Fuufu ! Komi-san ! Quintuplets ! Kaguya-sama !
Omg ep 6 of mob psycho 3 is my favourite episode of the year
9:10 oof as a German the roast against Germany was fcking priceless lmao
1:22 "Even anime didn't give us any wildly bad stinkers compared to previous years" tell that to a Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer fan
Cyberpunk Edgerunners is prollies my favorite anime.
Made in abyss in first place, my man 🥲  I swear more peoples have to see this masterpiece
i'll take this as a watch guide :)
Damn Made in Abyss at #1! Wasn't wrong when I told you to watch Made in Abyss S2 and put it in S Tier. Definitely an anime of the season contender, and for some reason the Crunchyroll idiots didn't put it in the nominees!
Missed out on live
Summertime Rendering and JoJo were casualties to streaming platforms that really did them dirty. Both could have gotten so much more attention than they did.
Garnt's videos never fail to entertain me holy fuck. Banger after banger damnn.
AND DANNY AARONS TOOO!!!!!
My own top 17 of the year: 17. *Uncle From Another World* 16. *Love After World Domination* 15. *How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2* 14. *Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3* 13. *Sabikui Bisco* 12. *The Case Study of Vanitas Part 2* 11. *Mob Psycho 100 IIII* 10. *Shadows House 2nd Season* 9. *Summertime Render* 8. *Ya Boy Kongming!* 7. *Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun* 6. *Urusei Yatsura (2022)* 5. *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* 4. *Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2* 3. *Chainsaw Man* 2. *Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic* 1. *Spy x Family*  Honestly, 2022 was a really damn solid year for anime, one of the best we've had in a long while. Here's hoping 2023 can live up to it!
Very good, I wonder how long he is sitting on those anime Cuts also I need the "gay girls innit" as a sound file
Maybe if you are not a straight 25 y/o incel virgin dude, the concept of gay girls isn't terrifying to you. If you are, it's horrifying, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
Yeah yeah yeah, just show me what you think of bocchi
No bleach 😭😭
I’m assuming this was a “Top 17” because it’s literally ALL the anime Garnt could be bothered to watch.
10:10 damn it’s 2:50 in my time zone, didn’t need to call me out like that
Bocchi was mid. Had 'cute girls doing cute things' but Tatami Galaxy did the 'Just like me FR' better with better writing and more interesting art. However, it didn't have 'cute girlz doing cute things' and the dialogue is too fast for the average anime viewer to keep up with.  Summertime Render is literally the worst writing in anime I've seen in years. I genuinely cannot fathom why anyone with long term reading/anime watching experience would call it anything better than mid. It has good art and decent animation but the writing is atrocious. One moment the MC is this genius detective and in the next he's going around asking random people if they have seen X even when he already saw they were dangerous and willing to kill. Then you have all the tropes of old 90's horror. Like my favorite 'Lets split up' even though the MC knows at that point that they take on the appearance of others. Writer can't decide 'is he smart or a damn vegetable?'  Call of the Night: It's basically Twilight but with good music.  Gundam the Witch of Wokeness. Minority discrimination, Xenophobia, Capitalism bad, Strong independent wahmen etc. Trash.  Cyberpunk Edgerunner had good music, great art and very good animation but shit pacing. The real reason you felt whiplash after each episode is because of how quickly the story goes from a delinquent kid in school to a dropout doing illegal activities to feels trips is fucking fast. The worst pacing is at the start though with how quickly the mother died. It had 0 impact on me because we hardly knew her but the show plays it out as if we should have cared. It managed to give me 'feelz' but that doesn't make it 10/10. It's pacing issues persist and I'd argue it's an 8/10 because of it. Still great but not worth the extreme praise people give it because they felt 'feelz'.
kevin really did made in abyss justice
My top 10 anime of 2022: 1. Kaguya-sama S3 2. Mob Psycho 100 S3 3. Attack on Titan S4 P2 4. Chainsaw Man 5. Made in Abyss S2 6. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure P6 7. Summer Time Rendering 8. Spy x Family 9. Blue Lock 10. My dress up darling  Edit: Have not gotten around to watching bocchi yet...
Aight so we just not gonna talk about Bleach
jesus christ mark goldbridge in a fucking Gigguk video the metaverse is real
What you did not find Spy x Family that funny? I shit my pants every week of laughter :D
Where Bleach
no mention of attack on titan, sadge
Ya boy kongming only being number 16 is like a personal attack tbh
i‘m at a point where id rather watch a decent new show than a great new season of an existing show. I did not care enough to watch mob psycho and made in abyss but i guess now i have to
This vid is amazing and so are the rest and 40k views in less than an hour XD Go on
What an amazing video! I can’t wait for the anime that will come this year!
Made in abyss season 4 changed me into a different person, and I mean it. This season might literally change some of your lives.
As someone who's watching this in 3  at night. I can confirm call of the night is great
Bocchi rocked hard in 2022
Gay girls innit😂
Still crazy to me that My Dress up Darling was this year for some reason, or last year I guess
Fuccking gigguk, now I have to watch made in abyss again and then the second season. I don't have enough napkins to do this 😭😭😭
based take, the new season of Made in Abyss was my favorite anime of the year!
superb. will try to watch the others that i didnt watch
Spy x Family has fallen down of late.
Bochi was about gay girls
Kaguya is high up, which I appreciate. It's so god damn funny, and is extremely faithful to the manga... like FMA Brotherhood faithful. Where season 3 ended is extremely satisfying, but the manga is about to end, leaving room for about one more season. Here's hoping
Being in this list is a much bigger achievement than being nominated in the crunchyroll awards tbh
E
The first piano riff in the transition to Made in Abyss punched me in the gut so hard. Kevin Penkin is a musical genius. Easily one of the best overall music composers of this era.
19:14 Which anime?
9:44 Wasn't expecting Angry Rantman 😂😂😂
Bro, did you just mispronounce Makima? 😂
He's going to be on Eminem list R.I.P
Blue lock is not good it’s so predictable and there is no way the ball moves like that in real life.
It's actually been a really great year for anime.
While I respect Gigguk’s opinion, than made in abyss, I personally believe this list is horseshit. That being said, it was a great year for anime.
Golden content
He does these vids so well. I'll Garnt him that
Haven’t even seen the video yet but i know it’s gonna be a banger.
i hear all this beautifully eloquent praise about made in abyss and honestly the soundtrack can probably tear my heart out even in a vacuum. HOWEVER i don't know if i can stomach the terror that this story probably is, if you can please do give me tips or something cuz i want to experience this without being haunted for the rest of my life
The beginning of 7:10 😂
i fell like every time one punch man or mob get mentioned it's mostly their art or animation that get talked about but i think one is such a great writer i really enjoy his style
Great video thanks!
Noooo my name is Liam
I need someone to give me a list of all the songs used in this video.
Made in Abyss S2 left me speechless multiple times
*My top 10:* 1. Case Study of Vanitas: Part 2 2. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 3. Chainsaw Man 4. Gundam: Witch from mercury 5. Mob Psycho 100: Season 3 6. Bleach: TYBW 7. DanMachi: Season 4 8. Spy x Family 9. Isekai Ojisan 10. Attack on Titan: The Part Before the Two Part Final Part of the Final Season
Dude literally forgot to the first cour of bleach TYBW on the list
Can’t wait for JJBA Part 7. Does anyone else have Part 7 as there second best manga of all time?
Excellent editing and FANTASTIC Number 1 choice. Made In Abyss did not get the recognition it deserved this year.
GREAT VIDEO
It’s Bocchin time
Fine. Goodnight.
bro really said summertime render does like mistery upon mistery, doesnt let you off the hook 10th bocchi the rock has cool ways to portray that the mc is depressed 4th wtf
Niko omillana gotta watch call of the night
Missed on tomadachi game,classroom of the elite s2,a couple of coocdoos but this video had been a W waited for sooooo long for this video since it’s the first time I actually watched anime for a hole year consistently,this season still sucks for 2023 but W review,WHAIT WHERE IS AOT/??
I couldn't agree more with the top 4. Bocchi, Edgerunners, Mob, Made in Abyss, all of these series touched my heart and I couldn't be happier that they all came out this year. 2022 was really something incredible
Just hearing the music during #1’s splash page sent a shiver down my spine. That alone should tell you how impactful it is!
Also Japanese WC shirts were inspired by Blue Lock manga so thats a big W for it
My name's not Liam but fuck you Garnt i aint sleeping its fucking 5am.
Summer Time Rendering was SO underrated. The music, the plot, the animation, everything was such a surprise to me! Everyone go watch it!🥰
2022 was a good year to be an anime fan
Man those transitions are slick
Really that crappy Gundam show with annoying stuttering girl rated higher then bluelock/ao ashi and Spy X Family. Thats some ign lvl ranking.
From 3-16 i disagreeed with every position by one or two, then you went to prove why tf i subbed. Tho mob is my favourite anime, i can absolutly give the one to made in abyss. 100% goated.
Goat of Anime youtube
It's funny how you went from Witch from Mercury to Kaguya-sama, and then compared Kaguya-sama to Code Geass as a gateway anime to bring new viewers in. Witch from Mercury's writer is the one who wrote Code Geass.
10:05 ....  He got me
If your animated show uses a bunch of different animation mediums, has a bunch of relatable but lovable characters, switches to live action for no reason, and is really funny— then you’re show isn’t Bocchi the Rock, it’s The Amazing World of Gumball
I'm glad that #14 was the one that got me officially into anime, started off 2022 perfectly
Wheres my dress up darling
we all know it's Spy times family
Absolutely awesome list!!! I'm really glad I checked a lot of your recommendations last year and most of them made it to this list. I hope 2023 keeps the hype going because 2022 was amazing at having a little something for everyone!
putting dannyaarons at 9:26 is hilarious
Made in abyss traumatizes u in a special way
Mad respect for putting MADE IN ABYSS in the first place
I knew Garnt would understand Kaguya-Sama because just like in Kaguya, Garnt's gags evolve over time and feel so organic. I laughed out loud when he said, "not this time" during the Bocchi segment. Seriously though, I love the way Garnt described Kaguya as a genre defining romcom of this era. I remember in an earlier video Garnt asked if there was such a thing as a modern classic. I think the climaxes reached in some of these shows like Kaguya and Mob answer that question with a definitive yes.  Circling back, the writing and production in these videos are incredible. So many creators are inspired by Garnt's work and these videos never fail to make me feel things. So thank you Garnt for all the work you put and congratulations on reaching the climax of your own romance this year!
Sad bocchi the rock got 4th could have been at least 2nd but as a slice of life show it stood against many top tier shows.
Sigh...Once again he fails to do Bleach justice. An anime that should have at the very least been in the top 10 only gets a 5 second mention....it ain't right man.
Dropped the cheese, Gigguk's upload again
4 words. You are awesome Gigguk! 🎉
Great video, as always. You are one of most entertaining youtubers I know. I started watching anime because of you
Completely agree with Made in Abyss
aot>>>>
Let's go Made in Abyss!!!
At this point I thinnk AoT is just keeping goin for pure meme value.
My top: 1) Made in Abyss 2nd season 2) Edgerunners 3) Kaguya-sama 3rd season 4) Jojo: Stone Ocean 3rd season 5) Summertime Render 6) Attack on Titan: Final season part 2 7) Mob Psycho 100 3rd season 8) Chainsaw Man 9) Jojo: Stone Ocean 2nd season 10) Jobless Reincarnation OVA P.S. Demon Slayer 2nd season would've been #10 if it actually started in 2022
Did you just use another section of super riser for the intro this time? Genius
This is why gigguk is the best anime channel . Garnt bcuz of u i know feel like watching made in abyss
the op drops go HARD
The Animezone back with a banger
Nothing beats Gigguk’s style of psychologically descriptive writing with a whole gallon worth of memes.
I really like Kaguya Sama but now that it has become so overrated, I must take back my first sentence.
Made in Abyss is one of if not the best anime made in the last 10 years. Top notch soundtrack, world building, art, story, characters, animation. It's just the definition of the word masterpiece. You may not like some of the themes but that won't change what those madlads at Kinema Citrus achieved.
Bro, since no. 14 I've been talking to myself "Better have Cyberpunk Edgerunners now..." and I was holding my ground, while greater and greater titles have been announced... I almost lost hope, and then - I saw "the" graphic, that couldn't belong to any other show... And you mentioning the game and the fact, that this masterpiece of anime has brought the game to life... That makes my Polish heart proud... Keep on!
chainsaw man the best 🤷‍♂️
Birdie Wing is about as ''ANIME'' as anime can get? I mean it's close, but Garnt you still haven't even seen Symphogear yet.   -and why is it so good?  Gay girls innit...
Too bad you could not mention about Bleach. The adaptation from the manga and the animation was perfect. "Now you fell like number 1"
i know a guy who calls it hunter squared
this was such a shit year for anime. like very few anime were actually deserving to be on top 5. last year i had goosebumps for litrally every anime on the list on the other hand this year half of the shows were kinda mid (i hate to call it mid)
Another masterpiece of a video. Great work Garnt
Genuinely surprised you placed MiA season 2 at the top. I love MiA, but I feel like the writing started to falter at the end of season 2, especially the way the author dealt with Faputa and the village chief. Also the iruburu arc felt almost like filler, in the sense that we don't really get much out of it for the protagonists (for example no new clue on Liza is given, and while we see a little slice of Reg's past, we don't really get any important piece of information). Mind you, it was a really nice filler, but it still deviates strongly from the main plot. I have the feeling the author really likes Faputa and wanted to put her inside the story even at cost of forcing it.
Props to Garnt for still watching and reviewing anime after all these years 👏
most of these shows deserve more recognition than aot and\or jojo so i dont mind with jojo and aot not making it in the list
As an introvert, I totally agree that even if you can't fully relate to Bocchi, you really feel what she feels. Like... I haven't been on the same situation, but I gotchu, girl. TvT
What an incredible year for anime. I only managed to watch Cyberpunk and Summertime Rendering so far (both fantastic), but the whole Top 10 is on my watchlist (+Lycoris Recoil).  P.S. also appreciate the implicit praise for Re:Creators, another one of my favorites.
I'm horrified at how quickly Lycoris Recoil was forgotten in 2022. It was an absolute banger.
The fact that during cyberpunk edgerunners you used music from Dawid Podsiadlo (edgerunners ost) melted my heart <3
Bro forgot aot
Man there were so SO many great anime in 2022 and I barely had any time to watch any of them. Only managed to watch Bocchi, and I loved it.
Dude just needs to admit Marin and Syd are the same person. We know, he knows it, just admit it already.
Honestly congrats on the good taste gigguk, you are missing some jojos in there, but i will allow it
Man isekai ojisan is so underrated, so many delays.. I still wait for ep 13.
You know last year has had some really great animes when Spy X Family only comes in at number 8.
In an amazing year of anime, for the top pick, I am 100% in agreement
I am sorry, the tifa incident was in 2022?!!?? That shit feels like 3 years ago at least!!
Honestly for me Made in Abyss has become too much of a suffer porn. I'll continue watching it but it's too much to appreciate the good stuff. Edgerunners maybe was a bit too regular, too mainstream to be fully appreciated  But Bocchi? I was so glad I caught up after first 2 episodes and witnessed the Bocchi sweep through the community. Amazing humour, great experimental animation and these characters. And the best portrayal of anxiety period  Waiting for more Chainsaw Man and hoping manga readers weren't lying, Spy×Family slowed down a bit too much in second half but had a good finale, need to catch up to LycoReco, Call of the Night and Suisei no Majo and I actually preferred S2 of Kaguya but rap battle and finale of S3 were amazing too
10:09 i am literally watching this at 3AM
This year was the year of the gay girls, innit?
W
MADE IN ABYSS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Time to watch Maid in Abyss
Gigguk’s skill at creating an emotional atmosphere is just incredible. The vibes as he was showing #1 was truly amazing
"leaves me with an emotion that is utterly indescribable"  Yeah, the way I explain Made in Abyss is "it visually and emotionally mirrors my experience of finally having trauma therapy, over 30 years after my first big trauma, and almost ten years after my most recent big trauma". Like, if anyone ever goes "why can't you just move forward and get over it?" I will tell them to go watch Made in Abyss, in full, and then get back to me.
Well done. The one show I wish could've made the list (at the lower end, to be fair) was "Do It Yourself," that delightful show that taught us all how to love making your own things instead of just buying them. The theme song remains at the top of my list, and this was a year we got "Chiki Chiki Bang Bang."   Thanks for a fun year, looking forward to this one.
This videos remind me why I'm an anime fan and why I should start watching anime again
why do you make me cry so damn much Garnt?
Perfect No.1, sad cuz u cant place Bleach, but its OK
I hate the jojo neglection
Scarred that Lucy made it to the moon without with David 😭
All the anime I watched last year: . .. ... [End of list]  This video really makes me want to find time to get back into anime.
Kaguya-sama S3 was peak, amazing, show stopping, perfect, my favorite anime from 2022.
I know that its not seasonal but I think one piece deserves a mention atleast this year . Also I wanna know is it the only like mainstream weekly running tv show right now .(We don't talk about boruto)
makima fans are guys who cant see red flags
Gay girls innit
In My Dress-up Darling Gojo Wakana's backstory is much like Batman's. Gojo: has 2 dead parents, comes from a very rich family famous in their field, raised by an older father-figure, learned his craft from a grand master who's a father-figure, was sad, socially awkward, inherited/will inherit a bunch of money & a very lucrative family business, & is regularly seen around beautiful girls
Bro be spittin fax for 30 minutes straight. Great vid! <3
Made in Abyss is what you call a Mature story.  The only disturbing anime without shock values, gore or edgy.   It is the Beauty that makes this anime so Horrifying
Great video, as always, Garnt! 2022 was a great year for anime, that's for sure. Tho I can't pick the best one. Can't say I agree with you 100% of course, but your list is... acceptable. XD  You really make me appreciate more of the anime I didn't like as much, and make me wanna pick-up anime I dropped (like Call of The Night). I did like the "vibe" you were talking about, I just thought the plot was too shallow.
Made in Abyss deserved it’s placement. Absolutely spectacular show that left you feeling stuff you forgot you could feel consistently while staying coherent
Made in abyss is Master piece and the best anime that I ever watched  Am happy that gigguk put it the best for 2017 and fo this year as well
*"Gigachad Wazukyan Soup carried the whole Made in Abyss Season 2, Not gonna lie."*
Not even kidding this is ALWAYS my most anticipated video of the year cause I always know Garnt is gonna knock it outta the park with his list
Uhgggg I tried so hard to forget this season of made in abyss
Pretty cool list
Thank God, Gigguk didn't put AOT or Bleach at number 1 spot.  Chainsaw Man is best anime of year 2022 tho.
Don't let made in abyss be first, don't let made in abyss be fir- FUCK. I still haven't finished season two. Not because it isn't brilliant, not because I don't love every second of it, but because I lack the emotional wherewithal to survive the things it was doing to me
As always, Gigguk speaking facts
PLEASE tell me the reason Lyco Reco wasn't higher was because they just say "naw fuck that" to Chisato's character arc and just ignored the fact that she's now living a lie (they can make this up in a s2 but come on.....)
Can't believe I nearly seen everything  on the list such a great year for anime. Penkin somehow just makes banger after banger.
7:09 "What happens if you add adorible girls into into a gun toating spy action thriller!?" Gunslinger Girl. You get Gunslinger Girl, Grant, you monster.
Where's aot
Welp, I had the sensation when Made in Abyss aired that some people would like it that much. I personally didn't even have it in my top 10 but I can understand I'm probably not the target audience since I'm not that into gore or horror.
Mid in abyss
Master, you have out did yourself again.
I had a feeling Made in Abyss season 2 would be great but I've been avoiding it because, well, I didn't want to embrace the inevitable depression that I assume is a part of the viewing experience 😂. But, with the praise Garnt is giving it, I think it's time!
Definitely the video to recommend to my friends who ask for some best of 2022 anime great work Gigguk.
Am I tripping or there are 2 big ass worldwide syndrome animes missing frm this list💀💀💀💀 aren't they supposed to be there garnt or💀💀💀💀
OMG  He knows HE KNOWS
You’re a HUGE W to the world. Literally the channel I point my friends to when I wanna put them onto anime. So eloquent with your descriptions. Thank you for being the Parasocial homie of the eons.
My man only made mob psycho number 2 for the transition
W list, but where is aot and bleach?
Man didn't disappoint with the number 1
MADE IN ABYSS STAYS WINNING
Hell yeah thanks gigguk your awesome.
Why no one is taking about eminence in shadow?
cant wait for winter anime 2023
okay gigcuck
W list. Wholeheartedly agreed. 2022 was a banger for anime industry as a whole. Now I can say, it has taken the whole world! 🙏
There are thousands of language in the world, and this man chooses to speak facts.
Legend Gigguk!! ❤❤
This video really make me want to sit down and see all these anime, but not right now.
Giggachad
What do you think about Fuuto PI?
JoJo wa doko?
Garnt's storytelling is just magnificent and just makes me want to finally get back ingo anime again. thanks Gigguk.
This man cant keep getting away with making every video better than the last!
Made in abyss on top
Ok this is such a based list
Overlord??! 😰
100% agree with the list
2022 was a good year
God I love Gigguk
henlo
Kinda salty JoJo wasn't mentioned but this was a good list anyway
I like BBC. Bleach Bocchi Cyberpunk
The ending literally made me cry
Made in abyss is like the Dark Souls of anime
W made in abyss!
Another great video 😌
Cool vid bro.😺
Where the is jojo?
I'm so glad mob and summer time rendering were on here. They are amazing animes.
Super Mario Brother 2 better
Based conclusion
Ok but can we just take a second to appreciate the transition into #1? It was so CLEAN!
mark goldbridge in a gigguk video
Is that the dude from Agent Fresco ?
W list
never thought id see mark goldbridge in a gigguk video
Made in abyss and Mob while decent didn't deserve to be so high imo. And this is coming from an anime only for both shows who was highly anticipating both anime only to be slightly disappointed mostly by the poor pacing of the individual episodes which just made everything weak. This is why I enjoyed anime like kaguya sama s3 & chainsaw man far more cuz their episodes individually were just way more enjoyable. They offered a lot more and thus CSM and kaguya sama s3's fanbase and hype completely decimates that of made in abyss s3 and mob s3.
W video thanks for introducing me and everyone else in this audience to a new array of anime
Where tf is bleach
Haven’t watched made in Abyss. Guess its time to give it a try
This video's match cut might be the best one thus far.
how does grant make every video so emotional Like jesus someone give his man an award
The Gigguck Awards
Dunno man, Cyberpunk wasnt anything so special.
This man chose to speak facts! And I love it.
Go to bed Liam, we all know you have to wake up early
Made in Abyss doesn't feel like an anime, if you know what I mean. I get totally different feels. It just doesn't feel like watching anime. It's like having a long fever dream or something. IDK how to describe it but yea, definetly deserves the number 1 spot.
The music in the witch from mercury is so incredible
Yeah, Made in Abyss S2 was my fav of this year too. It, like the other two shows on my top 3, Chainsaw Man and Bocchi, are examples of the sort of shows that you'll only find in anime. It just wouldn't work in live action, made by a Western company. Now if Tsukushi would stop sniffing his merchandise and write more chapters that would be highly appreciated. :P
I swear if Gigguk could he would slap Bleach as number one with the Number one theme Blasting.
Can’t believe I dropped made in abyss. Gotta slide back.
I have a feeling that he made Mob Psycho #2 just so he could make that transition
No ranking of kings😔
Made in Abyss Greatness!
Ppl really be dissing Ranking of kings ;(
No Ousama Ranking innit :'(
Edge Runners over Chainsawman is a bit insane to me
yoooooooooooo 5 min gang
My top 3 were CSM, Bocchi and Edgerunners. Don't really care where you rank them, just good anime.  Also shout out to DanMachi because S4 has just been unreal to watch as a fan of the series.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
That Mark Goldbridge insert just killed me
YES! YES! LYCORIS RECOIL!!!  I FUCKING LOVE IT!  In all earnestness, amazing list my dude!  Except... Bro, where's Bleach?
Chainsaw man's anime hype was basically when i get 99/100 and my mom beating the shit out of me for not getting 110/100
"I Really Want to Stay at Your House" hits different
so the lesson we learned from 2022 was , if it has gay girls in it , its automatically great
As far as Witch From Mercury goes, I just hope the Earthians get themselves some Zakus at some point. Sieg Zeon!
The disappointment i felt when bocchi is not num 1
Bocchi W
Gay girls innit
Came for the review staying for the review see you again in a season
Call of the night episode 1 made me say "goddamit kid, you're lucky this is an anime because you'd be dead by morning" at least 7 times. Good show
chainsawman overrated as shit cyberpunk or bocchi should win
I just realized.................... none of these can beat Goku
He mentioned Summer Time Rendering so I guess his opinion isn't that mid lol
Not gonna lie, the dub narrator for Kaguya is utterly amazing.
2 Things 1st: Awesome video 2nd: France
when he said nigga im black i felt it
YESSSS FINALYYYYY
Attack on Titan: Final Season, Final Edition     ....Part 1
when spy family theme started playing I immediately started crying for some reason.
Gay girls save anime
As a non Liam, I feel called out👀
Ok, I think I know how to do something but better now. Put gay girls in it.
Calling it now Gigguk is gonna tease Chainsaw Man as #1 and it'll be Bocci
Edgerunners is anime of the year, and one of the best shows of all time
2022 was truly the best year of anime yet, I dont even know if it can get any better than this :D
Can't wait for that demon slayer arc to be in theaters.
I tuned in at the right time during the Premier just when Gigguk was talking about Call of the Night xD
Wait Gigguk...did you just admit to actally watching the WM 2022?
Watching angry rantman frm India has me genuinely shocked
Grant knows Messi 🐐  Rare Grant W
GIgguk found a way to talk about the World Cup
Return of the King.
is this what humanity has come to
The anime zone once again delivers us an amazing video

Attack on Titan 2022: The Final season of the last finale finally ending...season 2!
I always love the music that comes with the little slideshow montage for every season/year 😂
FINALLY
2022 was one of the greatest years for anime in all these last decades
2022 was a great year for anime
Props to Allen for editing all of this and all of the videos this year.
We can all agree that *Bocchi Dwane the ROCK* is the real winner.
Nothing bigger than Ash winning the Champs in 2022.
ok
Monk's takes, what can go wrong, its gonna be great, in'nt...
It was a great year
2022 has been a spectacular year for anime, with titles like Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, and Chainsaw Man setting the bar for stellar animation and storytelling. While Cyberpunk: Edge Runners broke our hearts, Spy x Family and Kaguya Sama: Love is War healed us with their wholesomeness and comedy. Mob Psycho came to a perfect conclusion, while Bleach and MHA made triumphant and redemptive returns. Not to mention, new anime like Blue Lock have kept us captivated week after week. With such a strong lineup in the past year, I can't wait to see what 2023 has in store for the anime community!
Garnt, I am immensely disappointed you used the default youtube countdown lol. God it is the worst. Use the already existing mecha one if you don't want a custom one. The default count down for Youtube Premiere is ear grating and trash
let's gooo
I want a cheese pizza.
I've been waiting all year for this
Here before the premiere, gotta say, 2022 had a ton of top tier anime.
Tengen for waifu of the year
Pre-posting this before the premiere goes live, if Bocchi isn’t in the top 3 I will throw hands.  EDIT: I'll take fourth, based.
I better see some JoJo ending on here, cus a series like that ending is huge
This guy seems an awful lot like Garnt from Trash Taste ngl
Sydney brother
Fall was a feast but of cause crunchy-roll just had to fist us hard this year at the awards
Well he said he was going to upload it in january and I guess he did, fair play
I like how the manga ending of Attack on Titan was so bad they're dragging out the anime as long as possible so it's still eligible for lists like this.
Aoashi was an amazing anime which got kinda burried under Blue Lock's popularity, hella underrated, .. i think they've got 300 chapters of manga of which the animated just 100 ...cant wait for more
Don’t let this video distract you from the fact more than half of this years Bangers were released in Fall alone     And Love is War still clears
My own personal list 1. AOT s4 pt 2 2. Kaguya sama s3 3. Ya boy Kongming 4. Throne of seal (not considered an anime but who cares its peak) 5. Demon slayer s2  Animes i liked but havent finished 1. Raven of the Inner Palace 2. Spy x family
I love the thumbnail. XD
Top 15 for me this year  1.Bleach TYBW 2.Bochi 3.Chainsaw man 4.Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun 5.AOT part 2 6. SpyXFamily (part 1) 7. Cyberpunk Edgerunners 8. Demon Slayer:Entertainment district 9. Blue Lock 10.Mob Psycho 100 III 11. JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 6: Stone Ocean 12. Do It Yourself!! 13. My Dress-up darling 14. Akiba Maid War 15. Komi Can't Communicate Season 2   Haven't watched this once so might change after  Kingdom: Season 4 Suzume SummerTime Render Ya Boy Kongming! Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Ultra Romantic Lycoris Recoil Isekai Ojisan Tomodachi Game  So don't come for me just yet 🥹
Yessss
CALL OF THE NIGHT is so underrated. Everyone watch (read) it PLEASE lmao Also Urusei Yatsura returning was great
Bro I gotta go to work… it’s all your fault
LET GOOOOO
lotta people been overlooking Call of the Night, it's a really fun show that I hope gets a season 2. my favorite of the year of course is BOCCHI
amongus
In a normal year, Marin, Bocchi, Nazuna could easily be best girl of the entire year. Instead, they need to compete with each other and more!
Are ya winnin' Bocchi? You fecking well better be
Sad *Made in abyss not in the thumbnail* noises
Mob Psycho 100. Nuff said
Does anyone have any info if the new Aot season is coming this year?
I have been waiting for the past week to see what i had missed so i can go back and binge
1. Bocchi the rock 2. Kaguya-sama S3 3. Mob S3 4. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
The worst possible take incoming. From what i see on the thumbnail of this video, this is all not the "best anime". And i know, i'm just based, so i would choose something not many people even care about, so i'd rather stay silent what is the best anime... They won't understand anyway.
honestly, kaguya-sama NEEDS to be mentioned. it was AMAZING.
I wonder if Ranking of Kings will be on the list
<Call of the night and bocchi
I can’t wait to see Chainsaw Man at the number one spot     That’s what you could think if you don’t really know this man
The best to come from 2022 imo was Aot,kaguya sama and cyber punk🤝🏾CSM and Bocchi are also high up on my list.The different ways Cloverworks used animation to show how Hitori was feeling was amazing. The plot twists in Aot were great. The dual confession in kaguya was peak. Cyberpunk was just pain😂 and csm was fun. The last 3 eps of 86 if u count it were peak aswell.  Edit: glad cyberpunk made it in the top 3. Out of all the new shows it’s definitely my favourite.
The Witch of Mercury is so underrated. I wish more people watch it.
My Top 10 Anime of 2022  1- Kingdom 4th Season 2- JOJO PArt 6 3- Bocchi the Rock! 4- Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 5- Made in Abyss 6- Mob Psycho 100 III 7- Chainsaw Man 8- Kaguya-sama 9- Spy x Family 10- Summertime Render
Honestly what I'm looking forward to most is Garnt's humor throughout the video, as god damn cheesy as that sounds XD
Spy X Family is like AoT season 1. Everyone says thay watched it, but if someone says it's the best show of the past year. You know they only watched 1 show.
the real 2022 top 10 anime list
Made in abyss sure will be there in top 10 list that shit make me cry
My top anime for this year.  1. Shingeki No Kyojin FS P2 2. Kaguya-sama: Ultra Romantic 3. Lycoris Recoil 4. Cyberpunk: EdgeRunners  5. Chainsaw Man 6. Bocchi the Rock! 7. My Dress-Up Darling 8. Ao Ashi 9. Spy x Family 10. Yofukashi No Uta 11. Mushoku Tensei Special 12. Ya Boy Kongming 13. Bubble 14. Dr. Stone Special 15. Komi Can't Communicate S2  Truly been a great anime year for me ^~^ and I hope the same it has been for everyone!! Let's look forward to another great year!
I NEED CSM to be in the list
We all know his number 1 is going to be Made in Abyss...
Chainsaw Man is #1 for me. But knowing Garnt, he probably won't place it at #1. He will say something along the line "12 episode is too short" or "it's still too early in the story."
Cant wait😭😭
The real 2022 Anime Awards
The top anime is Spy X Family nuff said.
My top anime this season: (1 and 2 are very close) 1: Bocchi the Rock! 2: Chainsaw Man         and that's it because I didn't watch any other anime this season
The most biased list towards trash. Not even with an uppercase T.
1: Chainsaw Man, I've been following the manga since 2020 when I was at my lowest and I think I would've been dead by now if it wasn't for AoT and CSM and I just wanna say that I'm very hyped for "The Hero of Hell" 2: Attack on Titan Season 4: Part 2, AoT's writing in the 2nd part was more than impressive, I remembered when it was revealed that Eren was the one who told his father to kill the Reiss Family when I was 11, (2019) haha, everyone was going nuts 3: Bocchi the Rock: She just like me fr 4: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, The game is a disappointment compared to the anime, the characters feel so alive like when Rebecca said "It's Rebeccain' time" and Rebecadded all over David, I felt it 5: SpyxFamily: F 2022 but I liked SpyxAssasainxChildwhocanreadmind
My Top 5 Anime Of 2022  Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 1 Summertime Render 2 Chainsaw Man 3 Spy X Family 4 Blue Lock 5
Garnt uploads are always the best part of my day
After the disappointment for what crunchyroll did to moshouku tensei Grant said  Fine I will do it myself
My top 5 of 2022:  1- Bocchi The Rock 2- Kaguya-sama S3 3- Cyberpunk Edgerunner 4- Demon Slayer Entertainment District Arc 5- My Dress-up Darling            probably around 10 or more- Chainsaw Man.
glad to see both sydney and connor in the thumbnail
Garnt pressed premiere at x time and went to sleep. What a chad.
the quality of animation gets better and better with each year even tho the quantity of good anime is decreasing  and demon slayer really did break the animation this year!
oh damn finally!!!!!
This is gonna be good.
Wheres made in abyss, garnt? Don't do your boy kevin like this
I’m waiting for the Bocchi references
Knowing Gigguk His no.1 will probably be chainsaw man or aot
My favourites were Lycoris Recoil, Machikado Mazoku season 2, Bocchi the Rock and Urusei Yatsura.
Watch Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero 🐲
One of these is not like the others
bocchisweep
WGigguk
Thank god, I see Call of the Night here. I fell in love with the vibes of that show instantly. It was definitely worth watching. Especially at night
1. Bleach 2. Bleach 3. Everything else I forgot about 4. Bleach
Top 5 anime has to be   1-Chainsaw man 2-Bocchi  3-Cyberpunk eg 4-My dressup Darling 5-Spy x Family  (my opinion, love yall)
No aot in The thumbnail?
I really wanted Bookworm S3 to be there (even as a honorable mention  but I don't see it happening. Season 3 could have been it's best Season but it suffered from production issues and lack of episodes.  The anime is still good but it's more impactful and emotional in it's source material. They also heavily censored the dark parts of this series.  At least this year is pretty stacked with new surprise hits like Paripi Koumei that's why I'm pretty sure I'm satisfied
As long as Summer Time Rendering in the list, I'm happy 😁
Aot S4pt2 should be the AOTY
I've been waiting for this video. :) I don't watch that many anime but I'm curious to see which ones are worth watching. My personal favorites from last year were Kaguya-sama S3 and Made in Abyss S2. Chainsaw Man ofc was also good. I haven't seen Bocchi The Rock but that probably deserves a spot, too.  Edit after seeing the video: Seems like even though I haven't seen much I have finished the entire Top 10 (-Bocchi which is on my watch list) I didn't vibe with Witch of Mercury, Spy X Family or Cyberpunk that much. Mob Psycho was good but I didn't vibe with it that much either (which was also true for previous seasons). Demon Slayer is also in that category of great animation but subpar storytelling for me. I feel like Kaguya and Made in Abyss are multiple steps above these in terms of writing. I love the cast of Kaguya so much because the show seems to love them. No one is ever only the butt of the joke but there's a gentleness and deep understanding towards all of the cast and such a great level of creativity that it really touched me. And I haven't even seen the last few episodes because I don't want it to end for me. On the other hand I don't think I can add anything to MiA which Gigguk hasn't said in the video. This show is one of the best of all time and this new season was fantastic. They really captured being in a foreign and weird place perfectly where different rules apply and they of course completely rip your heart out without forgetting that there is no definitive good and evil in this world. Just a stellar production all around.
Yay, I’ve been waiting for this. Edit: I completely forgot that made in abyss 2 came out this year, by the time we got to 2nd place I legitimately didn’t know what the top spot was going to be. I’m not sure I’m brave enough to watch Made in Abyss yet, but when I am I’m sure I’ll love it.
Summertime Rendering is the anime of the year imo  But Chainsaw Man, Ranking of Kings, and Cyberpunk Edgerunners were great as well
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was the best anime of 2022
I personally liked Cyberpunk Edgerunners. It was better than I thought it was gonna be.
If there's any anime girl who deserves the award for "The Face of 2022" it's definitely Anya!
knowing Garnt he'll be awarding AOTY to Bocchi :(
My Top 10 (new) anime of 2022.  1- Summertime Render 2- Tomodachi Game 3- Chainsaw man 4- Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 5- Bocchi the Rock! 6- Fuuto PI 7- Blue Lock 8- Akiba Maid war 9- Aharen-san wa Hakarenai 10- SPY x FAMILY
Best anime is Uzaki-Chan Wants to Hang Out! season 2. There, I saved you all some time.
Cyberpunk came outta nowhere and delivered an experience we don't get often. The story, sound and animation were beautiful from start to end, it's not simply anime of the year it's one of the best shows we've ever gotten
My Top 10 anime (with a new season) in 2022.  1- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean Part 3 2- Kaguya-sama: Love is War season 3 3- Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 4- Demon Slayer season 2 5- My Hero Academia Season 6 6- Made in Abyss season 2 7- Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War 8- Overlord season 4 9- To Your Eternity Season 2 10- Mob Psycho 100 season 3
Summertime Rendering was the best New Anime for me. . I really loved the steins gate, and this show was really similar to it.
When Rosen Garten Saga review?
He finally opened Reddit a n first thing he saw was the trash taste if you forgot it it probably wasn't important meme and remembered he has a video to upload
Bleachigo was my favorite in 2022 and 2023.
Its a good day when gigguk uploads!
If bocchi doesn't get AOTY I'm unsubscribing
Bocchi the rock lets goooooo
i can't believe this is so funny and funny
it's all fun and jokes until you see him in
if it can't be played it doesn't belong to videos list putting a non-video on a videos list is deceptive and shows disrespect towards your viewers
I need at least Summertime rendering mention. It was so under radar bc of Disney but it was one of the most enjoyable new animes for me this year
