Id get biscuits from braums then switch out the mcdonald's biscuit. Go to wendys and get some gravy but also taco bell for some hot sauce. If i really felt hungover id go to the gas station for hashbrowns and put it on the sandwiches. Now i have an air fryer and if i get fast food im waiting till i get home and pop it in
I've never had a quarter pounder
Why do Americans insist on calling ham, Canadian bacon? Seriously the only country that produces "Canadian bacon" is America. In Canada, there is peameal ham, ham and bacon.   Peameal ham is ham with a cornmeal crust. This was invented in Canada.   Ham is regular ham.   Bacon is the strip bacon.  The thing Americans call Canadian bacon is what the British call back bacon. It is a British product that Americans make, and for some insane reason, they call it Canadian bacon when they got it from their own British settlers.
I love how they color coordinated with the pillows lol
11:38 Very sure that the subtitles were improvised. As a fellow Korean I'm fairly certain Eugene said "하나, 둘, 셋" (One, two, three in Korean)
What is wrong with dudes face?
Fun fact: the baked apple pies debuted in the early 90s. If you're going to blame anyone, it might be Barbara Bush's fault (but I don't think so).
17:34 Keith with the callbacks!
McDonald's fries are middle of the road; McNuggets are the worst form of fried chicken you can easily get (Tyson is even much better). McDonald's is the standard for fast food like Starbucks is the standard for coffee: because everyone knows what it tastes like, not because it's good. That said, the McGriddle should be higher :P More than 2 will kill you instantly, but it is one of the few things on the menu that actually tastes actively good compared to other food.
Here's a fact:   The McDonald's ice cream machines are generally NEVER broken.  They're manufactured by a company called Taylor Company. Here's the rub:  Only Taylor maintenance employees are allowed  to clean these machines.  It's a process that takes 4 hours. They are disassembled and thoroughly cleaned every two weeks.  However, McDonald's claims the machines undergo a daily heat treatment cycle to kill off any bacteria. So, the machines aren't broken, they're just down because nobody has  sanitized them.
McGriddles are life.. #justiceformcgriddles
the road in front of my house is lined with Bradford pear trees. The blooms smell like cat pee.  I don't like McDonald's Fries! Hardeez has so much better!  Big Mac is only edible if you take off the extra bread and leave off the gross sauce.    Nuggets and the McDouble are the only good things at McDonald's anymore.
I’m so confused I live in Canada and the McChicken is not on the Valley pick menu. It’s actually like five dollars and there’s a junior chicken that’s way better. The breading is seasoned. Does that not exist in the states?
I'm a McGriddler for exactly two reasons: the syrup injections mean the texture isn't as dry, and you get that sweet/salty mix. That's it. It's not GOOD, but the muffin's just awful and the biscuit's too dry
Nice
The machine is never broken. It either hasn’t been reassembled after cleaning, not cleaned from the night before, or it hasn’t finished churning, so it’s just liquid. 😊
Eugene: He had the funkiest tasting spunk  Keith: ohhhhh. of course.  Eugene: *Spattered Laughter*
I will lay my life on the line for a chicken McGriddle
McDonald's NEEDS to bring back the deep fried apple pie nationwide. It is by far one of the best things they sell.
Now it's 1 for over $2 for the hashbrown.... Greedy asshats.
Engine only bites the bun and never eats any of the meat.
I love Keith talking about buying a McChicken and a McDouble in high school. I would too but i would take the chicken patty ans put it on the double and call it a McB***chen
Eugene saying either nothing, giggling, or absolute nonsense instead of the names of things is amazing
McGriddles are fucking gross
Sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is my shiiiit I just substitute the nasty folded egg for a real round egg
Imagine having multiple options for McFlurry?! In SA we get oreo...
The egg bacon biscuit with cheese tastes awful when there's cheese on it
The McChicken with an extra chicken patty is goated. And in Denmark the chicken is actually crispy, idk about other places
fun fact, the reason it is called double quarter pounder is because they actually did called it half pounder for once, and people think than 1/2 is smaller than 1/4, and sells less because of that reasoning. they changed it to double quarter pounder and it sells better. bless america.
seeing neds face pop up in old videos is still such a big jump scare😭
18:18 the fact that c*m is actually really rich in B12....
Bring back Rank The Menu! ❤
Bring back Rank The Menu!
Cuz cheese are not naturally occuring in the ocean - 😂😂
no hot n spicy? 😢
as a mcdonalds employee, im here to settle the issue with the icecream machine. bascially we can usually get sundaes and not soft serve cones because the icecream is too liquidy, it wont hold its shape and be stiff enough fr a cone but in a cup it doesnt matter as much. youre welcome
McDonalds has just too much dry bun for all the burgers imho....
Should’ve gotten the bacon McGriddle lol
Eugene  is freakin adorable 🥰
As a guy working in a rural VA pizzeria, I fully understand and agree with Eugene's distaste for ranch.
22:37 let me stop you right there Keith, a 1/4 pound burger IS a normal size burger!  My dad raises beef cattle, me and my brother used to have cows, and I even had one of our breeding bulls, I should know if you butcher a calf (usually a 1.5 year old heifer (young female) or steer (a castrated) bull (male) calf you get quarter pound burgers usually in 4 packs. My family farm in Atalissa, Iowa breeds Polled Hereford and Angus and crossbreeds between them (the black Hereford) I’ve had all three and I gotta say Hereford beef is WAY underrated compared to Angus and everything else!
I work at McDonald’s and my birthday today (January 29th 2024 my 32nd birthday ) and this video was uploaded on January 29th 2022 my 30th birthday  Let’s go daily double, which probably won’t be in this video
Oh my God "double dip the animal" is something that will live rent free in my brain for a long time. Thanks Keith <3
The "Big Boy" from Bob's Big Boy, was also a club sandwich in burger form. I think it pre-dated the Big Mac by a few years.
My McDonald's go-to is the Double -Cheese Burger, but I order it like a Big Mac ( no ketchup, no mustard, add Big Mac sauce and shredded lettuce). It becomes a Poor-man's Big Mac! I think it tastes even better without that extra piece of bread in it. Actually, I eat it open-faced, with only one piece of bread, so I can justify eating the fries too. :>}
Mcgriddles rule, whatever
chicken mcgriddle is tasty but the other ones are nasty imo.
This stuff is good,go back
Iv never caught filing mistakes but I just caught a something already filmed put in a separate part well talk about hashbrowns at 7:45 the have Keith with the sausage mcmufin but praising the hashbrowm lol paste and copy
Eugene saying anything but the name of the food as Keith announces the next item had me cackling. The Spicy Chicken Sandwich as he said "William H. Macy" 🤣
It made me sad when Keith said "the hash browns used to be 2 for $1, now it's 1 for $1" and now they're like $3.50 each.
Best McDonald's items ever... Deep fried apple pies Double cheeseburgers Cinnamon donuts Double sausage egg McMuffins Root beer  Cold 1/4 pounder with cheese
Eugene talking about people named Frank having angry cum is insane to me
Keith, you've never tasted your own $@#? I find this hard to believe
Please welcome to the stage…. Sarah Ann Dipitous
1 is hash, 2 is Mac, 3 is saus n egg, 4 is flurry, 5 is habanero mc chicken
I love that Eugene is so committed to the mumbling-nonsense-bit during each item intro, but giggles after every single one.
The cheeseburger is the reuniting of the bovine feminine (dairy) and the bovine masculine (beef typically comes from steers) and we sense it's beautiful bovine balance
FREE PALESTINE
I’m learning Korean and completely forgot Eugene is Korean. Him counting in Korean threw me off 😂
I hate McDonald’s and most fast food places but the McGriddle is an exception
I have always related to Eugene and never known why I am also a middle child. She has only sisters I have only brothers makes sense now why I relate so much.
Wait, one hash brown for 1.00???   My friend just got one in Denver and it was over $3.00!
Keith is wearing his gold command uniform.
Filet O Fish is hands down my favorite MacDonalds sandwich. I don’t want lettuce or anything else other than the original recipe.
Sausage and egg mcgriddle is best food McDonald's makes. They are the real eggs in Canada at least (like the mcmuffin egg in this), which i guess has to help. Only thing else acceptable at top is a freshly fried hash brown, those are goated.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. I love the McGriddle, and so should you.
Ranch is overrated
Eugene is wrong about everything a lot why is he the one who’s right
mc griddles for breakfast, quarter pounders for lunch since they switched to fresh beef . . . and RIP the old fancy chicken strips they had they were really good but they've been gone for a few years now
McDonald’s has their 1,2,3 dollar menu, and nothing on it costs 1 or 2 dollars.  Also the mcchicken costs like 3.29 now.   In 10 years we will be paying 8 bucks for a mcchicken…
that last bite should be the McKeith
Y'all, your McChicken is so disappointing. We have a really nice one in Poland. It's my second favourite McDonald's burger.
Eugene* ranks
"When I'm drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken" -Keith
keith and eugene are the underrated duo
eugene saying hana dul set 🥺
Keith, come to Malaysia and eat Malaysian McDonald's!!
I am 42 years old and can honestly say McDonald's beef has never touched my lips, I've probably consumed about 5000 chicken nuggets over the years, just never had a burger lol.. Dairy Queen burgers yup, Wendy's burgers yes. My husband thinks I'm insane
I agree with Keith - hash browns should be ranked much higher. Better than French fries
Totally agree about the double quarter² pounder. They absolutely ruin the burger by adding extra meat and cheese but not anything else. All you taste is the burger
I love how they bleep out 'cum' like 10 times and then leave in 'fuckiest tasting spunk'
The way I YELLED Bradford pear at the same time omg 😂
Australian apple pie is still fried and looks completely different. No lattice design just entirely encased in crunchy
this was such a fun and silly video!
WHAT ABOUT THE BREAKFAST BURRITOS
Talks about how they want more views then you got eugenes disgusting gayness bringing them down
"That was the before times" And now, so is this, really.
I think anothet factor thqt effected the ranking is the temperature you ate it.
The hash browns are perfect 🥰 Hated Filet o Fish as a kid. Love it as an adult.  Love the Oreo McFlurry!
eugene x sex and the city is everything
Eugeith is BETTER than Keugene
Lol the music at 22:40 ish was so dramatic
Look I’m not saying the McGriddle is GOOD I’m saying I’ve been getting it since I was little and I can’t replace it now
26:13 dududududdududu
Would’ve been better if the hot & spicy mcchicken was added to these rankings
I want to see TACO BELL
There's a famous story that McDonalds at one point tried to add a 1/3 pound burger to their menu. But people wouldn't buy it because they were angry that the 1/3 pound burger cost more than the 1/4 pound burger despite the fact that it was smaller. Because 3 is less than 4.
"we dont want to have the fish lay around for too long" mate i hate to tell you, its been laying in a lukewarm compartment for like 2-3 hours before it was given to you
Why did Eugene get final say and shot down Keiths appeal?
Bring back just Keith led videos his one hurt my brain ….. I just subscribed but may reconsider….
I’m personally offended that the SEC McMuffin isn’t on here. The McGriddle doesn’t count
Iconic Golden retriever and black cat duo
EUGENE I WOULD GET THE CHEESE, BUT IM LACTOSE INTOLERANT!!
i love when they put eugene and keith together sm
hot and spicy mcchicken will be king forever, add pickles tho
Are they sponsored by Yellowjackets or something?
You could imagine this is Keith and Ambrosius if you close ur eyes. I think they would get along in real life though.
Sausage burritosss???
Justice for the mc griddle. I dont eat mcdonalds breakfast very often but when I do, its a joyous occasion because of the mc griddle. The mc griddles saves mc donalds breakfast.
FILET O FISH. extra sauce. pickles. lettuce. yeah
The pancake taco at the end should be called the “McCumDump” or the “McCumster”
you should do this with Panda Express
Keith is just letting Eugene pick the entire rankings.... Asks for ONE item to be moved up, and Eugene just changes the subject. He is so selfish and self absorbed.
Eugene's off the cuff rant about middle children and their function...I'm here for it. lol
i feel like everything was basically right, but keith was right in saying the mcgriddle needed to be higher
I'm trying to decide what I want from mcdonalds because someone else is ordering for dinner and I have no idea what I want, and since this is super important to me the only person I can rely on for this is Keith and Eugene with their reviews. I'm taking this order very seriously
it's so funny they put the mcmuffin in the middle as a benchmark then slowly put most things behind it as they realised the food jsut wasn't as good as they though 😂
I'm pleasantly surprised that I agree with this ranking more or less. There are some things that are ranked lower that I personally prefer more than things that were ranked higher, but the reasoning makes sense to me. Also just glad the the Egg McMuffin got the love it deserves as the best McDonalds breakfast sandwich.
I'm loving the cross collab within the try guys world. please keep this up. it's wonderful seeing y'all bantering at each other. you seem happy so we all feel happy. thanks!
McGriddle.  Only in America folks.
I have a thing for Keith in a mustache. It looks so good on him, he’s legit hot
Wish they do more of these
wow, Eugene's expression change at 9:34 has me a little scared
“Euith” has me dead💀
I love how there are now multiple try guys era, First: at the before place Second: with the before person
SAMANTHA IS COMING BACK!!! Make sure your spunk doesn’t taste funky!!!
A little late here, but totally team McGriddle.
Oh gosh.... The beef sweats reached their eyes 😅
I pretty much only eat McNuggets at McDonald's, so I LOVE this!  I also love Eugene and Keith content
The spoon is shaped like that to connect with the machine. The spoon is  used to stir in your goodies.
Idk why but I seriously love Keith with the dad looking mustache ❤️
I cant take Kieth's sauce brand serious considering hes the guy that finds "spicy" fast food items like the McD's spicy chicken sandwich actually spicy
Eigene where are you?
isn’t keith’s shirt like captain kirk
pillows and shirts
There's a section of this background music that is used in the opening of a BBC F1 podcast. I never expect it.
I got a McGriddle on a 9 hour flight from Illinois to Hawaii. I took one bite it stayed with me until we landed I was dehydrated and then I threw up. I love the McGriddles  Edit: we have a Bradford peach tree in our front yard every year it’s rotting fish and pussy
The fact that Eugene messed up every single food item had me rolling lmao😂😂I’ve had to rewatch them so many times cs it’s hilarious
Former McD's manager for a franchise store; The folded eggs come in a plastic packet. If you want good eggs in the morning ask for round or scrambled. Also, don't order breakfast at night, it is not very fresh and gets slapped into the microwave, except the sausage which is cooked to order at night. As for the ice cream ours could only be serviced by one company, who refused to come out half the time. They also caused an ice cream machine and OJ machine to catch fire once. And soft serve can't be served if the machine hasn't frozen it enough, but as long as it's still in the correct temp range we're allowed to do sundaes. If the machine has been overworked, it stays in a heat cycle sort of thing so you have to give it like an hour sometimes to cool off. I've watched it blast ice cream mix all over a coworker and floor when it was overworked. Super gross.
hana dul set ? 😂
hmm they may be onto something here, instead of chicken and waffles, how about hotcakes and nuggets? with syrup, or even spicy nuggets and hotcakes
8:57 "not beef #1"
offended at the mcgriddle ranking
I know it's wrong - but, If I was ever on death row, I would request filet-O-fish as my last meal. I would kill for a filet-O-fish. sorry!
i vote try guys try actual canadian bacon (peameal bacon)
this feels like a simpsons and family guy crossover episode
they should try doing prosthetic make up
Hate the fish 🐟 ĺove the 🍟 .
petiton for more rank the menu!!!
Nom nom nom!! I love my try guys boys! Also glad that try is also used as 'Tri". Best trio with a great cast! I love em all!
Can’t believe the slander this man is throwing at those hotcakes
as someone who hadnt had a burger from mcdonalds until a couple months ago, im glad i wasnt missing out on much by always ordering basically the top 4/5
The McDonald's in the Netherlands has more lettuce on everything
McDonald’s makes me so incredibly nauseous for like no reason and it’s so annoying when my entire family wants it on a road trip but I almost vomit every time I eat it
Can we have a dislike button just for that person thou shall not nameth. Or is it too rude?
man I wish the McCrispy in Canada had Crinkle cut pickles like the U.S instead of shredded lettuce
Slowed it down to .25 when they say the double cheeseburger. It hit me so hard 😂
Keith is so right about the hash browns though, you eat one and you want a second, then you eat that one and you ALWAYS feed bad!
justice for the mcgriddle
I actually really like the McGriddle. It’s super creative, and actually yummy. The smell is decent, I had a one literally yesterday, and it is a good breakfast to get you going for the day. Obviously it’s not for everyone, but if you want a blast of flavor, then this is for you.
I'm watching this at 1am instead of sleeping :(
I'm not sure if Eugene keeps messing up the names on purpose or by accident but it's adorable.
"Baby people , kids" wow hahah
I dont even like other tarder sauces but I like McDonald's. The fish fillet is seriously underrated.  Get the double fillet with extra sauce and you can split it one fish to each side of the bun and for only a dollar nore you have two sandwiches for two people to shaare.
the "im a big egg boy" part was so funny LMAO. y'all better create more videos of this dynamic duo!!
“It makes me have to gasp for air” took me out🤣 McDonalds makes us all gasp for air Keith hahah
Eugith is all I could think about at the start of the video 😋🤣🤣
Was that Alex??!
Julia tries everything is so much better than watching stoners stuck in a middle school mentality.
You don't have to "rank" it, we all know it's unhealthy crap.   😎
Eugene’s gibberish 😂
If you put the butter on the hotcakes they are so much better I just learned that recently 🤣
I once ate 5 Hash browns from McDonald’s- it was like 3 pm on a breakfast all day thing and it was the first thing I ate that day- I felt terrible but it was wonderful in the moment
Keith looks so good in mustard yellow dangggggg
“ Smells like an offensive Yankee candle”!  Hilarious🤣
i cannot believe that they shit on the mcchicken like that
the fact that the single hamburger was ranked so low ASTOUNDS me. My Mcdonald's order every time is 2 of those no pickles and a large coke.
the gay guys
8:40 No, Eugene is right. From what I remember, Coke and McDonalds have a deal and because of how their machines that dispense the drinks work, the ratio is different than a can or bottle from a factory. There is more syrup in it! Maybe fresh has something to do with it, im not sure. But it can happen at other coke product restaurant/fast foods but it’s an iconic mcdonald’s thing that sprite there and coke there at better than the bottles and cans.
God I really want McDonald’s
You can just see how much Eugene loves Keith  🥹
It's me. I'm the Mcgriddler.
I’ve never felt more disrespected that the McGriddle is ranked so low. The McGriddle is culinary perfection.
2023 Years making me sick
Ugh Keith's mustache.
Idea for future Rank the Menu - can both Keith and Eugene have their own ranking? I’d love to see how different their taste is!
I agree with the fact that the McGriddle is a little much... so I started getting the chicken McGriddle! It's WAY BETTER!! The chicken perfectly balances with the sweetness of the syrup!!
Sharon Depenius 💀
I UNDERSTAND that the McGriddle is bad but CMON it is the most unique thing on their menu and there is just something about it that is so addicting and I personally think it is the greatest thing McDonalds has ever done
mcgriddle was THE fast food item for me growing up. it woud take first for me on nostalgia alone.
My favorite order is double cheeseburger with Mac sauce ON THE SIDE  (if you get it on the it there's ALWAYS too much or hardly any sauce)
The fact they liked the Fish idk if I can trust them now 😬
I’m a McGriddle bitch until death
No sausage burrito?!?!
I just went hiking in dirty high top black converse 💀, Eugene probably saw me with them old shoes
I love these two together 😂
I’m right you’re wrong shut up
So glad nuggies won first place
When Eugene said, “I’m a big egg boy! If I had a chicken I would just be suckin’ on that butt” I absolutely lost it😂😂
I'm in the UK, my favourite item was called the chicken legend. They took it off the menu. :(
Is it just me or did Eugene count in Korean (hana, dul, set) at 11:38?
I put emphasis on the "o" in McDO=alds 🤣
My dads name is frank.  Thanks for that Eugene. Thanks.
Are they in front of a green screen? I thought I saw a couple suspicious green reflections in their hair and off Keith's sweater.
I agree with Eugene on the ranch as someone who was raised in Texas 😂 it’s TOO MUCH I’d rather have any other sauce
i wish that both keith and eugene ranked each item on their own list because in the beginning when they both tried the mcgriddle keith loved it and eugene didn’t really like it so it was ranked pretty low
Thanks for trying our food
Nothing is more CRISP than a McDonald’s sprite. And I will throw hands about it 😂
If their ship name isnt euth im quitting
Can't believe you didn't try the Chickenburger. The sauce is the most memorable experience to me with McDonald's and the main reason I keep coming back to it at all.
I love filetofish
Fun Fact: C** contains protein and has 5 calories
McGriddle was massively disrespected by Eugene, might be the best item on the menu
I love how as time goes on, you see Keith getting more and more food delirious
I used to eat 6 of these things, no beef/burgers. Now as vegetarian I eat 4.5 of them... ice creams, fries (technically not even vegetarian bc beef juices for flavor?), hash brown, egg & cheese biscuit w/o bacon. limited but still good, although I can hardly get nutrition from any vegetarian fast foods. Burgers are gross to me so I wish for more good veggie burgers like impossible burgers, but also for Non-burger options!
😊
Hotcakes in mcdonalds hk is delicious xD
But I’m too scared Eugene food but he is very adventurous but unfortunately I’m not.😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
I love Eugene he is so fucking funny.😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
guys as a former McDonald's employee I can say that the round egg is real and we make it on the stove. The yellow flat egg comes from a box... you can just ask for the round egg instead of the yellow and they'll do it for you.
Funny how he said Hail Mary. The filet was put on as a Lint option
apple pie in australia is the best dessert at mcdonalds
how do they eat everything in one go!?
Considering that McDonald's is American I was expecting the American menu to look less shit but then again is it really surprising
This has made me realize that the McDonalds is so much better where I live, the mc chicken is so so good here and the american one looks like it's wet
Sharon Dipidus is my drag queen name
I love the McGriddle but I take the gross faux egg off
The fried apple pies were amazing
omg this was hilarious 😂 I LOVE eugene and keith together! their banter is the best
i refuse to believe 2018 was 5 years ago
“I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken when I’m drunk” 😂😂😂 Keith is so unintentionally funny it kills me.
Now that they are the Tri-Guys - we now have a the Before time and the Before Before time.
This video made me realise that the UK and US McDonald’s are so different?? Like different menu items but also completely different packaging
"This one is ✨️ICE COLD✨️..... Let's see what it's like 🤠"
More rank the menu!!!
Loving the McDonald's add before the video started, felt very appropriate
They are more like British pancakes
More rank the menu!!!!!
THE dynamic duo.  I'm so here for this.
When Keef said he used to get the McChicken and the mcdouble the only thing that came to my mind was "wait that's the mcgangbang".
I'm genuinley worried for Keith and Eugene's health
you didnt review the iconic breakfast burrito???? what the FUCK
Niggas gay
Did my eyes see Alexandria? 👁️👄👁️  Brilliant vid guys ✨
HOTCAKES LAST PLACE?!?!
I love the rank the menus. Keith and Eugene are hilarious together
Why haven’t they done another one of these!! I really hope this becomes a series in the new TRI GUYS era!
A McDouble made like a BigMac is the best thing on the menu. It's got all the flavours of a BigMac without the stupidity of a middle bun.
I LOVE Keith and Eugene together
Bro coming back to this now I wasn’t thinking about the drama until I saw Alex go to the fridge for the chicken sauce and BOOM it hit me lmao
I love the McChicken but also McDonalds depends on the country😂
Without salt, the fries are garbage. The McChicken is best had with ketchup and pickles. (and yes, it has gotten thinner on chicken and thicker on breading) The shredded lettuce would work great with the McFish. And the two egg types (scrambled and puck), the scrambled texture is so much better than the puck.
29:54 hahahaha
Just got a jarring feeling seeing the intro lol 😂
the average canadian will make fun of an american for calling ham "canadian bacon".  we both call the same thing bacon, and we do not call "canadian bacon" "bacon"
I was deeply offended by the McChicken rating but I do have to agree sometimes that it tastes different and a little bland  *sometimes* she’s too important to my nostalgic memories to offend her, my forever fr
The breakfast burrito is best to me
I need another rank the menu please
I had chicken nuggets today and it tasted like cardboard. I feel like spicy Mcchicken is their top tier food.
The McChicken isn't a dollar anymore :( Literally crying, screaming, throwing up at the price raise. $2.39?? Bestie that's supposed to be two whole McChickens and I get only one now :(((
I'm sorry but the filet o fish is not in anyway better than either of the chicken sandwiches
Also, mcdonalds hashbrowns are my go to for a hang over.  I don't get the loud noise hang over, I get the sick stomach feeling hang over, so the grease and potato really helps
Justice for McGriddles!!
They are spot on about the cheese burger having too much bread. When I get McDonalds I get the cheese burger and always get rid of the top of the bun.
I adore Eugene and Keith together. They’re such a fun duo.
magical, tho I do like mcgriddles and hate the fish lmfaoooo
‘What is it about fries?-‘ ‘Salt.’ That was so funny to me
100% mcnuggets are the best
I love the apple pies. I stand by that comment.
....I LOVE the hotcakes!
hamburger at 18??????????????
I feel like the McGriddle was personality victimized by Eugene. Loved this mesh up 😊
Rank Ben and Jerry's ice cream :)))
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLES
I remember a Try Guys video where Eugene came out, and I was like, bro... come on, you weren't exactly hiding it.  I love him not "hiding" it anymore.  I lost a brother to suicide, because of his sexuality, and I wish he was here to see this funny ass dude embracing his personality.    Also, Keith's mouth scares me.  I'm also a giant, but why is his mouth so big lol.
the trader joes hash browns that look like mcds are better. so much better
why don't they just share it instead of wasting food
I can tell you those eggs are not microwaved. Don’t ask me how I know.
Sharon Dipendis would be a great drag name
soooooo basically Kwesi is the new unofficial official fourth try guy which I figured they would do. It was either going to be him or a female for  diversity reasons... which im not mad about! GET THAT JOB KWESI!
Are you guys intoxicated while eating the McDonald's? If so, love it.
I’ve watched this more times than I can count. Hands down my favourite duo, the chemistry is just undeniable! Eugene can really be himself around Keith and it’s wholesome af.
My top McDonald's burger is the Daily Double (McDouble + tomato and lettuce with different sauce and big onions instead of diced) it's great and I'm sad you guys didn't try it. Also the Deluxe Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Deluxe Double Quarter Pounder are way better than the regular. The lettuce and tomato help with the dryness on those and I think Eugene would enjoy them better.   Also please don't suck on the McFlurry spoons!!! I worked there and the square piece is what attaches to the machine that stires them and that machine only gets cleaned when visibly dirty or on slow days.
The mcgriddle is best without the egg. I get sausage and cheese mcgriddles (sans egg) and it tastes much better.
the bacon egg and cheese biscuit and egg mcmuffin should definitely swap places!! 💯
the mcgriddle is everything to me. the sickeningly sweet pancake bun compliments the overcooked egg and salty cheese like no other food combination on earth. truly god's gift to mankind
I would put fries first
Ew I hate how you see Alex for a sec.. Skag..
I know I’m super late to this video, but the reason Eugene didn’t like the McGriddle as much as it deserves is because it was the bacon McGriddle. The bacon isn’t hardy enough to stand up to the craziness of the syrup. The sausage McGriddle is far superior.
I love McGriddles but I am also ready to admit its not the best thing on the menu, or necessarily good, I just love them. McGriddles taste like home.
Fun tip: if you have an air fryer, you can totally put leftover McDonald's fries in them, and they taste exactly the same. Me and my family learned this after the mcdonald's worker accidentally gave us 80 chicken nuggets (Four 20 chicken nugget boxes) and something like 4-6 large fries (it's been a bit, i don't remeber exactly how many portions of fries we got). In case anyone was wondering, the chicken nuggets also did really well in the air fryer.
More Rank the menu please!
The comic difference between the size of the bites they take out of each thing will never fail to make me laugh. Eugene takes a delicate bite, suitable for someone tasting a wide array of items, while Keith shoves half the sandwich into his mouth at once
Why do they still have plastic spoons for mcflurrys?? Europe banned those and now we have wooden ones, kind of thought they would change it globally too
Rank the menu is the best thing I've watched in a minute
No breakfast burrito 😔
i hate their chicken nuggets
The McGriddle is the greatest sandwich ever
As a middle child, we needed a king of middle children
2:30 hello misty, *you crazy f*cking b*tch*
Uhmmmmm where are the chocolate chip cookies 😭
mcdaonlds is  jail food
29:02 for example: SCHOOL LUNCH
7:34 YEAH EXACTLY THIS
my favourite from mcdonalds is the sausage & egg mcmuffin & the hot cakes    i also love the fries when they r hot & salty dipped into a caramel sundae
I call the McGriddle a McNasty, I can’t stand the weird combo of syrup and  salty meat 🤢
i like eugeith better!!
Definitely do more Rank the Menus! Y'all make comedy magic together
I once got a cheeseburger that was missing the patty and it took a few bites to notice. Proof that McDonald’s is all about that little slice of gold.
It’s so funny how Keiths eyes glaze over and he clearly gets food drunk.
dude, i'm a slut for the mcgriddle
They have to be high while doing this😂
i love the bradford pear c*m tree reference
Great taste in clothes, terrible taste in food.
“Why is the filet o fish so high??” 🤣 I love them together so much
More rank king and eat the menu 😄
I feel so bad that they do this to their bodies but I love it so much!!!! Please do more crossover with eat the menu and rank king!!!
NED?!
mcdonald’s hotcakes are unmatched. that fake butter & sugar syrup really seals the deal, too. its breakfast dessert and it’s a national treasure.
When I was in highschool I used to work at a McDs and on weekends my shift would start at like 5am, and because it was so early would feed us breakfast and I would always get the sausage McGriddle. There was something about it, shit slaps
I got the double cheeseburger when I was a little and upgraded to quarter pounder with cheese when I turned like 11 or something. Milestone moment for me
the fact that 5 years ago, Eugene chose BLUE (Keith color) for Best and PINK (Ned color) for Worst. IT WAS FORETOLD ! NED WAS THE CHOSEN ONE 😆 all jokes aside, it's comforting to see the internet healing and learning on a more mature level as it reaches a new stage of evolution. no more beauty guru apology videos over insane drama that never should have occurred, but now it's creators and businesses holding themselves accountable to the standards they set for themselves and I respect the difficulties they face. although there is absolutely more work to be done by immature, shadey creators, the change is happening and that's a good start. love you tri guys 🎃🤘
My heart hurts for how low the mcgriddle came in on
You should do a Canadian McDonald’s rank the menu! It tastes so much different. We use a different frying oil that I think is just WAY better than the American McDonalds and our apple pies are to DIE for. 😍
"The before times, in the before place..." Means more than one thing now.
Broken machine when it is most likely cleaning itself
omg mc chicken is the only thing i eat from mc donalds
Just throwing this out there but THEE ONLY thing I get from McDonald's is a Double Filet O Fish with extra tartar sauce & pickles.  Which at its peak of pleasure must be consumed piping hot the second they hand it to you **chef's kiss**
Freaking love you guys!!! 😂😂😂
I can’t help but notice how much more Eugene has sprouted into his personality  after coming out than when they first started doing videos. It makes me so happy to see him be so comfortable with just being himself. I love it so much.
lmao i’m high they’re for sure high. it’s a good time.
omg why does american mcdonalds look so sad? and i think its so odd that the same chain has different items depending on the country
I love this crossover! Do all the Rank the Menus!
It's Bell, Ball, Boot, and Bone, btw
I worked at McDonalds for years and theyre not bags theyre giant steel tanks about 5ft tall that hold the syrup at a perfect temperature and flavor.
I love how they dressed in Mcdonalds colors its so fun!
fast food eggs freak me out. Also mcgriddle is good with cheese and the meat- not the egg. that sounds very weird. But also I cannot eat McDonald breakfast without my stomach being wrecked for the day.
this is my first time watching this video and damn these two are amazing together lmao, i had a genuinely great time
This is the hardest I've laughed in like a full year 🤣
The before place😂
my mcdonalds order coming while i rewatch this :
I got a free apple pie one and they weee decent
as someone who only EVER gets chicken Mcnuggets and fries at mcdonalds, I'm very satisfied with this.
I lowkey fuck with the filet o fish my grandpa gets them on Fridays and he's a good catholic
Ham and peameal are two different things and both of them are sometimes called canadian bacon
ned was edited out seamlessly from this one. It's like he was never even there.
Egg mcgriddle... instant fuzzy teeth from the grease.
what was 16:17 lmaoooo
I want more of this. also Eugene, come on how did the biscuit get higher than the mcgriddle? it's so dry and crumbly
Quinnipiac has those trees all over campus. I transferred. Not bc of the trees, everyone was racist, but the trees sucked too.
music is loud af but the video was great so it's fine lol
my FAVORITE part of this is the fact that Eugene had a full on giggle moment and I don't think I have ever heard him laugh so hard. It made me smile. Also this video has almost 4M views so safe to say it did pretty well.
Chocolate syrup stays in that form that form because it has no dairy in it and virtually no chocolate. Only chocolate sauce sauce of real chocolate and has dairy and then solidifies when cold
McDonalds has the worst fast food! It is hilarious how herd like Americans are to believe it is good🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
Worst egg muffin on the planet! They dont mix the egg! Tasted  like pressed powder!
What I find reaaly good, is an egg mcmuffin, no meat, with the hashbrowns in the sandwhich
6:42 Nah Ned was the Samantha. Look at where that got him.
Dude I’m 24 years old and NEVER had a fish filet sandwich from McDonald’s
I was today years old when I learned the cme trees were Bradford pears.
I’m from NZ and honestly maccas in USA looks so much more disgusting than ours 😂 would put hash brown, chicken Mc muffin and Big Mac at the top spots 👌🏻
and that's how i learned there's TWO trees that smell like nut!
Eugene and I have great taste. My go-to meal from McD's is a big mac, fries, nuggets, a mcflurry and a soda
insulted by how low the sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is
I miss the chicken McGriddle 🥲 it was a big piece of chicken on the McGriddle bun. So tasty 🥰
once y’all got to the Big Mac, Eugene started feeling Keith’s food highs 😂
I know people love Eugene and Becky as a duo, but honestly Eugene just has amazing chemistry with both of them
a cheese burger has 1 patty 1 cheese slice, mcdoubble is 2 patties, 1 cheese slice, dbbl cheese burger is 2 pattys 2 cheese slices
My favorite mcdonalds breakfast is hotcakes and hashbrowns! To each their own :)
Their chemistry is insane
watching this now knowing about ned bein the pink one the fact that the "worst" sign is pink is perfect
“When I’m drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken” that’s so real me too kieth
McFlurrys have fallen off though. No more chocolate sauce, it's rarely more than soft serve with Oreo or whole frozen mini M&Ms on top and Blizzards are better.
McGriddle needs to be above the fish that’s a crime
“In the before times, at the before place.” 😂😂
It cracks me up everytime eugene doesn’t pronounce any of the unison words
15:14 Keith talking about McDonalds and then the movies made me think of my own memory. When I was a kid, I went to go see a movie with my cousin (he was wearing cargo shorts) and he came up to me and whispered, "I've got an entire happy meal in my pocket" I didn't believe him until we got into the theater and he pulled out chicken nuggets and fries out of his cargo shorts lol!
Them: "I have never met a person who gets the hotcakes for themself."  Me, who bought himself the hotcakes for breakfast on his eighteenth birthday recently and enjoys them greatly despite the syrup not being real maple syrup:
The reaction to hotcakes has me shook. I will keep them to myself
I agree with Eugene. Ranch is just not that good.
The complexity of a McGriddle I can’t
very sad Spicy McChicken was not on here
no sausage burrito is such a loss
this is still such a favourite
"The before time at the before place" I had to look at the date posted omg
I LOVE bacon egg and cheese mcgriddles tho loll
I feel so hard done by in the UK wtf even are our maccies breakfast options
So about 6 months ago I found out a professional chef said that the fat content of "Mcdonald" or "plastic" cheese slices brings out the flavour in the meat of the burger 🍔
the mcgriddle is the best thing that mcdonalds has for breakfast and i will die on that hill
I love that they match the pillows on the couch
baby people. . kids 😂
Justice for the hot cakes 🎉
The mutual giggle at 2:10 is everything.
Me at the beginning: ooooh it's been forever since I had McDonald's... Me at the end: yeah, I don't want to feel sick today...
Weird how eugene would probably be more loyal to his printouts than *cough cheater cough*
mcnuggets are gross... the only decent thing is a big mac the rest is putrid...
Honestly McDonald's is absolutely the best fastfood withe the best prices. Along side Sheetz. With Arby's being the best more expensive one
It took years after middle school for me to distinguish a quarter from a half
I love you, Eugene but keep your fingers out of your mouth. Is gross.
Oh I love Eugene being on this rating episode
not all the ads being for burger king
Eugene is me when we do the pledge of allegiance in school 😂
“I love the pope’s outfits, they’re suuuper gay” - Eugene
all I'm thinking about is how tf does American McDonalds not have a big tasty?!??!!!
the mcgriddle is the cornerstone of the breakfast menu!
Classic Mcmuffin is the best. The pancakes are great but the syrup is terrible. Fish filet is the best thing on the menu.
caption says eugene says "thought it was set" at 11:39 but isn't he counting in korean?
what about a 'Rank all Eugene ranks something' video? :D
If Eugene is Samantha, Keith is Miranda.
A big mac is just a McDouble with Shredded lettuce, Thousand Island and and extra bun. Just order a McDouble with shredded lettuce and a side of Mac sauce and save 50%.
American maccas never ceases to disturb me
They act so high towards the end! 😂
The McGriddle is like my favourite McDonald's item behind the hashbrowns 😭
Egg and sausage mcgriddles just hit differently! I felt run down afterwards, but omg it brought me so much joy when eating hahaha. Sorry Eugene I'm with Keith on this one: it is not good but I can't help but love it! Pancakes, eggs, sausage and cheese all in one
Loved this eat the menu and rank king mash up! In defense of hotcakes, if you add the butter and strawberry jam it is just cake for breakfast which I like. A lil breakfast cake never hurt anyone. Mcgriddle deserves last imo
I’m so glad I can keep watching old videos I have never seen and not have to see Ned
Who else got a Whopper ad midway through this video?
Sad they won’t be able to eat a hot n spicy
Oh it is. The mcgriddle is my breakfast lunch and dinner. It's so filling lol
ironic that the "worst" sign is in pink 😂
Keith is funny in every situation. And Eugene is 💗
Eugene repeatedly plugging Yellowjackets warms my frozen, canadian-wintered heart
I don't understand how a Mcgriddle from McDonald's is both the wettest  and driest food you have ever eaten
Mozart Horn Concerto played by Dennis Brain, while watching the Try Guys eat a $1 McChicken… am I in the matrix simulation? This combined (minus try guys) was basically my high school experience and feels so targeted 😂
This video takes me back to 1912
they have great chemistry and I love the color coordination with their outfits and background decor
Huh, the color for best is Keith's color while the color for worst is Ned's. Well played.
Do y’all not have the hot and spicy??
Apple pies are still fried in the UK mate 👌
Does America not have the wraps? Chicken caesar's a banger
I don’t recommend falling asleep to this video and waking up to “If I had a chicken I would just suck the eggs out of its butt. That’s how much I like eggs.”  I’m not ready for today.
my only question is, why are american burgers so thin? Here in bangladesh most burgers are equivalent to 3 US ones stacked...
"sing to me so I'll eat you", KILLED ME 😂
I actually do love Keith and Eugene fucking around 😂 this is awesome
0:00-0:12 this intro got me
"Eugene Lee Yang: famous internet Catholic."
I love how I've rewatched this a few times over the last few days and I keep getting burger king Whopper commercials
They always bring a smile to my face, when they collab together.
Just got jump scared by He Who Shall Not Be Named
Not me getting a Burger King ad 😂
Eugene and keith remind me of my swedish friend and i... he tries to be serious and im like "when im drunk i'd eat a whole ass chicken"
24:19 to answer Keith's question - I actually used to work at a bun factory that made McDonald's buns. The big Mac buns are just really tall buns that are sliced with two blades instead of one. Nothing crazy.
bruhh my comfort food is the crispy chicken sandwich 😭😭😭 with extra pickles?? 🤤
Mcgriddles are the best thing from McDonald
Y’all this is the pairing we didn’t know we needed. But you made a crucial mistake. YOU FORGOT TO RANK THE CINNAMON ROLL IN THE DESSERT MENU!!!
How did you miss the sausage burrito? It's awful on the body but it's one of my favorites lol
the lack of diversity for the breakfast😪 and to pick a bec mcgriddle??? get the classic sausage mcgriddle
While rewatching this, I got several ads for Burger King
So I’m assuming that lots of people are seeing Try Guys videos suggested in their feeds for the first time…. I’m happy that this is the one my algorithm chose to show me 😂
Keith should have put the syrup from the hotcakes on the nuggets and hotcakes lol
When is the next rank the menu!!!!
THE BEFORE TIMES IN THE BEFORE PLACE D:
Missed opportunity to be Euth (pronounced youth)
I worked at a McDonalds for my first job and they wouldn't let 90% of the employees refill the soft-serve machine because it was such an old, poorly made, testy, garbage machine that would break if you looked at it wrong.
I got a burger king ad on this video lmao
Also I'm not a ranch person either and I am also from Tejas.
So I heard a news story about the history McDonald's fries. Apparently they're so good because they have their own freezing method and it makes for a better, more crisp fry. They even have a patent on it.
almond blossum tree
McGriddle number 17???????? Are you flippin kidding me
The fact that i know EXACTLY what tree Eugene was talking about
“I’m right, you’re wrong, open wiiiide!” will never get old lmao
Justice for the McGriddle. The closest thing to sci-fi not food that a food can be. It’s a textural and flavor experience that cannot be replicated. Is it objectively good? No. Is it delicious? Yes. Does it fill the little depression hole inside you temporarily? Also yes.
I got a Burger King ad before this video
fr tho- wendy’s fries have overtaken mcdonald’s ones now - idk abt where you are but where i am atleast they’re always fresh and crunchy and pair perfectly with a frosty
McGriddles are the greatest! I dip them in ketchup, makes them even more wild!
It’s wrong but it’s so tasty, the sausage egg McGriddle.
Love these two together! Bring this back
A quarter w cheese with Mac sauce and lettuce.  That's where it's at
The pancakes are the only breakfast I get from McDonald’s
And so, the chaos of these two together becomes more evident.
McGriddle was ranked way too low. When the maple infused pancakes are fresh and hot they are awesome.
“When I’m drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken😠” had me dying
MORE RANK THE MENU PLEASE
I love Eugene's voice.
My order at McDonalds is literally filet-o-fish with extra lettuce. i love it!!!
When Ned cheated on his wife , classic
u guys missed ths sausage mcmuffin
I will NOT take this McChicken slander
When Keith said that after one hash brown you want another and after the second you feel BAD - no statement has resonated with me more.
Honestly, I'd probably swap the top and bottom spots, I absolutely despise McDonald's chicken nuggets
I agree with the ranch!! I hated everything you ordered came with it!!
Rank popular cookies
Eugene's commitment to announcing the foods in gibberish is so funny
The Mcgriddle is disgusting. I say that as someone who LOVES them! But they are so gross because it's pretty much an entire diner breakfast in a sandwich. It's horrific but so freaking tasty
Keith with the mcgriddle is Ned with his wife
im a mcgriddler
I almost always get the nugget combo at McD and Oreo McFlurry when I want something sweet 🥰 used to get their twist cone as a kid, but they don’t have it anymore 😢  P.s. McGriddles are good for breakfast 👀
the reason the fountain drinks taste better is because McDonald's has this machine that takes all the oxygen and carbonation out of the soda part and shoves it all back in within seconds. it's crazy and it makes them taste AMAZING. only McDonald's does it.
Fun fact about the McFlurry spoon it used to be so small that people use to "smell sugar" with it look it up lol
why did i get a burger king add before i watched this.
Cannot stop replaying 12:27, so in sync… a beautiful melody
Out of all of the McDonald’s items, I only either get the quarter pounder or the nuggets. Either one, I will always get the mocha frappe with it
Keith & Eugene are like baking soda and vinegar, the most fun when combined.
Cherry blossom tree 🌳
20:46 "There's paper on my burger, but other than that its really good"  McDonald's summarized in 1 sentence
Where is the sausage biscuit? That was top tier for me back in the day
The hotcakes look like scotch pancakes??? Idk if theyre the same thing???
"123 the egg bedgybeddedboouuu" got me crackin up
i love mcgriddles... am i the only one? :(
The fact that the “worst” sign is pink 😏
Filet o fish minus tartare plus barbecue sauce.  Extra cheese.
He should have chosen the McGriddle with just sausage. That is amazing. I feel like anything else you add to it is a problem. The chicken one isn’t that bad.
The reason their drinks taste better is because they put more carbonation in their drinks and the straw is wider so more carbonation hits your tongue.
I always forget how huge Keith's bites are watching eat the menu. then you compare his bite to Eugene. Keith please you don't have to eat that much in a single bite-
justice for the mcgriddles in 2022!!!
You can tell Keith an Eugene got toasty before this video lol
You missed McAloo tikki
Okay but hear me out. This needs to continue but international McDonald’s. The Australian McDonald’s is soooo much nicer looking than these. I need to know how they compare
the pancakes are one of the two only things I will ever willingly get at mcdonalds. they are gooood
Bacon McDouble + Spicey Pepper Sauce >>>
We missed a burger but it was just on the counter.... crazed expression don't worry we got it
Fuck I want McDonald’s now. I don’t even like mc Donald’s. Give me fries
Can't stop laughing at Eugene laughing at himself for not even attempting to say the actual name of what they're eating.
THE HASHBROWN WAS ROBBED!
Although now I worry for both of your health .. the Keith and Eugene dynamic for this section, I love it
Just noticed Eugene has tiddies.... he could be part of the big tiddies club with bm, wonho,shown, and namjoon and JK
Also not a ranch fan, I prefer balsamic or oil and lemon
The chicken sammich needs pickles or like coleslaw , lots of aoili and more seasoning,  and more moisture in general ... also I hate having to use the words moist and moisture.. it just feels yuck
The Hana ,dul, set .. took me out .... I automatically threw rock 🪨
Eugene talking about rooster brings me to a whole different eat everything menu , I apologize like 333 times, my brain just goes there
My favorite is the Mcrib, available all year in germany baby!
27:47 is my favorite moment from this episode. Keith's face when he says "Its PrOnoUnceD DepEdUs" absolutely kills me
I didn't realize how cute Eugene and Keith are as a duo. They just work with each other so well
27:47
the sound the mcgriddle made when it hit the table omg hahahahahaha
Also Eugene with his elegant bites and Keith just digging in is a great parallel
We need way more of these two
Eugene acknowledging injera made my heart smile❤
We need more keugene for sure
That tree thing is true and I AM THAT FRIEND
AS A MCGRIDDLER..... i completely understand why eugene put it so low 💀
Eugene not actually saying the name of the item each time when they are presenting is sending me
Bradford Pear trees DO have a very specific odor….but it’s not what they seem to think it is. 😂
I just realized the "Worst" sign is Ned's color. How very appropriate.
the BeFore times, at the BeFore place
The video went well haha looking forward to this duo again soon 🎉
I can't believe the disrespect to the McGriddle!!! 😭😭😭
McDonalds...come for the Big Mac, stay for the diarrhea.
Worst being red makes sense
I love watching these two - my favourite of the try guys ❤ but I will say there is so much differences with the American McDonald’s in comparison to the U.K. McDonald’s - would cool if eventually they had a look at other countries menus too
YOU MISSED THE BREAKFAST BURRITO IM ACTUALLY SEETHING AND MALDING 😭😭😭😳😭😭👁️🚬👄👁️
Lol I got a Burger King ad
Why does Eugene hate the only things I like 😭
I am a proud McGriddler and those things are a masterpiece in engineering
“Becuz cheese is not naturally occurring in the ocean” 😂 Eugene in regards to the fish filet half a slice of cheese
I love taking the hashbrowns and dipping them in the breakfast sauce (it's the bagel sauce)
Ah, a safe Try Guys video! I love these guys, just basking in their chemistry without you-know-who
be nice to canada! also what is eugene saying when keith says the name
I can smell the food through the screen and idk how to feel
Not me rethinking my burger choices.
THEY PUT BRADFORD PEARS AT MY SCHOOL T-T right where the outside eating area is like all around it
McGriddle Stan here! I always get it with no egg! Just a sausage mcgriddle and it's so good! I also get the one with chicken lol yummy
You forgot the breakfast burrito.
I just got a Burger King ad 😂
Fun fact; mcdonalds fries are not vegan. The eggs for the egg mcmuffin are cracked and put on the grill. And the biscuits are made daily. Cheese is the most expensive condiment. I worked at Mcdonalds for about 5 years.
The other day I had a sausage McGriddle and I put the hash brown between it was good
Ngl, I tried American Mcnuggets when I was in florida and they were pretty dry and underwhelming. I think the Uk ones are better - have they ever done an episode where they compare certain menu items from different countries? I’d be interested in their thoughts.
i had no idea the fish fillet was for catholics during lent. i indeeed ate a shit ton of fish fillets in my childhood during lent season. Aswell as subways tuna sandwhiches.
We took the hot cake batter and made fried onion rings. Sandi in the grill made us chili too!!! Good times
Worked there for yrs! Egg on the McMuffin are real. On the riddle. Eggs on the biscuits and Big breakfasts are prescrambled. I don't know y. 🙃 Good times!!!
I HATE the nuggets at McDonalds tho, pancakes are better (not the best) but better. Like Big Mac, Fries, mcchicken are all better than the nuggets. The nuggets just have a weird taste.
I love seeing you two together! So funny
Fun fact. The middle bun in the Big Mac is there to absorb all the juice and sauce so it doesn’t get all soggy
Eugene needs to try a hash brown on macgriddle, both fresh. I want to see his reaction to its magnificence.
When it first came out the filet o fish was good to me and the only way I ate it was with Mayo and ketchup and nothing else lol
The perfect crossover
I hope to see more Eugene and Keith videos in the future! I love this duo!! 💓
Whenever anyone in my family starts a story with "when I was a young (typicially "girl" or "boy") my brother and I sing "when I was a young warthoggggggg" and I'm literally crying, that wasnt on my tryguys bingo card for this week lol
I personally believe that all of the breakfast sandwiches are better without the egg, the eggs are icky
“Yeah… they would trick Becky with that one” 😂
I love these two together ❤️
Is it weird that I prefer cold and soggy McDonald’s fries to hot ones
I love the Keith and Eugene duo. They bring out the best in each other 😂
💙💚💜
Euberger.  I just love Eugene and Haperberger energy.
"worst" being Ned's color now hits different
I would just like to say that McDonald’s nuggets are the worst chicken nuggets on the fast food market and are disgusting . Thank you
I got a burgerking ad……..talk about desperate
7:34 I disagree, it takes me to AT LEAST my third hashbrown to question my choices
“When I’m drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken” MEEEE
The fact that Eugene knows what injera bread is made me do a double take(I'm Ethiopian). I doubt the pancake really feels like it tho
dang the really disrespected the mcgriddle & hot and spicy like that :/
😮I saw Alexandria, love ya girl❤
I like watching them slowly get drunk from the food
The only difference between the Double Cheeseburger and a Mcdouble is on a piece of cheese. Literally a slice on cheese, lol
So mcgriddles are better if you ask for a round egg 🥚 and the fish is good if it's fresh
I love the griddle !!!!!! So yum :p
“When I was a young warthogggg” is the line that made it occur to me to like the video
As a prior McDonald's manager the round egg is cracked and put into round shapers and you put water in the top of this machine which spreads it around the egg. The scrambled it prepackaged and cooked in the prepackaged container like a lean cuisine.
Usually from what I’ve heard , McDonald’s doesn’t get fountain drinks in bags, they get them in large aluminum containers.
I hope post Ned we have more Keith and Eugene!!  Also I am from the UK and I feel like we categorically have the worst McDonalds
love their friendship sm
As a middle child I feel SOOOOO validated🤣🤣🤣
McDonald's hot cakes may not be pancakes, but they are DELICIOUS
Wow, McNuggets #1???  I would rank them at the very bottom.  They would have to be on sale and I would have to be some kind of hungry to eat those.  The Big Mac,  Sausage and egg McGriddle and coffee (iced or hot) are my top 3 McDonald's picks.  I rarely order anything else from there.  Fries used to be great but now have weird aftertaste and are terrible unless super hot.  Since they quit frying the apple pies they are only good stuck in a cup of their vanilla soft serve on a hot summer day.
3mil views? i'd say it did REALLY well, give us more XD
I can't eat the mcnuggets anymore because the last 2 times I've gotten them there was a giant black hair inside my mcnugget
god this is making me crave McDonald's
20:33     :)     Very nice.      Thanks      <3
Eugene mumbling / making up names is the best bit in this video hahaha.
I miss when McDonald’s had grilled cheese lmao
stop the McGriddle slander
the McGriddy
you need to come to NE and do an Eat The Menu at Runza
Eugene’s intro about titanic KILLED ME 😂😂😂😂
I think they should do the deluxe double quarter pounder, it adds mayo, tomato, and lettuce
Keith: I want to appeal the McGriddle Eugene: OK  Eugene: **ends video**
I was way too proud of my skinty little double cheeseburger ranking so high after you both tasted it 🥹
the plain hamburger has always felt divorced to me
My local park has a Bradford pear tree, it’s smell is no less than a war crime but it does smell exactly like cum
The McChicken is a great sandwich
I gotta say, I love the Keugene comedic dynamic. Y’all are so funny together, and I hope you make more of these someday
From Keith trying to get him to sit in his lap to this I love it, this video is so fun
I love this video so much
nuggets above fries is an L
With all these eat the menu videos, how do they not have a heat lamp in their kitchen?!?
Chik fil A has the best chicken sandwich, and it annoys me that Keith as a chicken lover disregards them because of their moral stances.
I’m genuinely concerned for Eugene’s childhood and for Texas. Ranch on ice cream? Tf? 😂
"Just like that I fucked my friend" aged like rotten milk
i enjoy the filet o fish and used to get flamed for it but it’s really kinda good
in brazil the apple pie still deep fried and still so freaking delicious
is eugene just making random noises while keith says what the products are called or am i dumb?
The fries were listed as not-beef, but the reason they are so good is because they put beef in them. Not sure if it’s beef fat or something similar but there’s definitely beef in those potatoes.
THIS IS ONE THE BEST SHOWS. RANK THE MENU!!!
You know hoe what you crave can sometimes/often indicate what you need/lack/is deficient of? I wonder what makes Keith need/crave so much chicken... (Ps. sorry for bad english/misspellings, english in not my first language).
McGriddles are the best option on the breakfast menu!
Those apple pies are so small!! I swear they're much bigger in the UK.
Eugene seems so happy!
HOT & SPICY IS 10X BETTER THAN A REGULAR MCCHICKEN
I feel valid based on the Big Mac review thank you Eugene ❤
I work at a McDonalds in the UK,  it’s odd seeing all the different menu items and packages. Just a fun thought.
Fun fact: Bradford Pear trees not only smell horrible, but are invasive! They are also ALL OVER OKLAHOMA and I am HORRIBLY ALLERGIC. Grew up with one of the fuckers in my front yard
Seren is a welsh name
~the before times~
I am not ashamed to admit that the big mac is the only reason I eat at McDonald's lol. I've accepted its gross but Eugene is right. The sauce is where it's at
Also, what-a-fish is gone from whataburger :(
Fish filet is actuallt for muslim people cuz that is the only thing they can eat there- but even then, they use the same stove for all of the meat :(
This makes me so happy ❤
I'm so happy u guys started these videos in light of everything. First time I've been able to watch a video and not get upset since everything happened.
The fact we will be getting more of these two paired together because there is one less person is a win
i wanted to watch some try guys but a lot of that content is very cursed now. fortunately this one is safe
The McGriddle stans are coming with some McRiddles
Mcdonalds uses a fresh cracked egg on the egg mcmuffin. You can get this on any breakfast sandwich if you ask for a fresh cracked round egg.
I'm rewatching 🤣😵‍💫 and I so wish I didn't have to se Alex for the 1.0 second she was there looking for the chicken sauce. 😵‍💫 JFC... Everything hurts now.
MORE KEUGENE PLEASE ❤
Injera bread he says 😂
Keith and Eugene are such a great duo smh
keith never having a mcflurry and trying to suck the spoon like a straw 💀💀 pure moment captured
Totally wearing my old beat up converse watching this
God this made me crave McDonalds 🤤❤️
I feel like the hot cakes, chicken nuggets with syrup would've been a way better option to go with at the end. 😅😂
How come I get a Burger King ad for a video about Mc. Donald’s?!
well, if you're here rn, hey... ykkk
I just really wanna know what kind of trees Eugene was talking about.
I know objectively the mcgriddle is disgusting but god it’s my favorite fast food item in the world
I wanna see the chicken nugget pancake taco with maple syrup
I just got a burger king ad on this video I’m not even kidding that’s hilrious
I agree with this ranking 👍
the other nugget shape is a bone - not a bowtie!
It always warms my heart how comfortable and quick to smile Eugene is around Keith.  And the fact that his goofy side comes out more.  Iit's such a fun and healthy friendship 🤭
The Big Mac is made from a soy mix I think b/c it does not taste like the Quarter pounder meat at all.  Had to spit it out.
Idaho became the potato state partially thanks to McDonald's Kroc's desire for uniformity of fries.
I eat a McGriddle once in a blue moon for comfort food value.  They are right about not eating anything else that day.
It’s been 5 years?!
TRY THE STEAK EGG AND CHEESE BAGELLLLL
Seeing Keiths bite compared to Eugene makes me appreciate how much food Keith is able to eat in Eat The Menu XD that big ole mouth is truly talented
Justice for the McGriddle. The top 3 should be the McFlurry, the hash browns and the McGriddle then fried and double cheese burger.
Please more rank the menus! 💜
Hashbrowns should be ranked higher idc idc
As an Australian who works at a McDonald's, it's so weird to see how the American menu differs from the Australian menu and what things are the same
They did the hamburgers dirty. All you need is Xpickles Xonions
I agree with this ranking. 5 of the top 6 things are the things I usually order so, yeah
Justice for ms. Cheeseburger!!!
no one: Eugene: I do like hell
Factoid for Keith: the difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger, is that the latter has two slices of cheese, and the former only has one slice. Which, for some reason, makes the burger cost a dollar more.
I think this is my favorite combo, they’re both amazing
I love a filet o' fish with pickles added. I don't care if that makes me a monster.
The fries are so amazing because they are treated with beef broth before they are frozen. It gives them a somewhat meaty taste.
So this is has supplanted the Before Mcdonald's video from The Before Place as the video I watch when I know I have to eat but cannot force myself to do so. Thanks for making things like this. I know it probably sounds cheesy and is just a video to y'all but it actually really helps some of us take care of ourselves. Thank you.
Hot tip is you can substitute the good egg on any of the sandwiches just specify “round egg”
Lmao I got a Burger King ad 🤣
29:30 omg i’m eating an oreo mcflurry rn! (eating?)
Y’all did hot cakes dirty bro
There are SO many Bradford pear trees around my apartment and every time they bloom I just 🤢 there’s also a strain of weed that taste just like it too and it makes me wanna vom every time I smoke it lol
Rip cinniminis they were crack in sugar form but they were amazing I wish u were still here
I’m with Eugene on the ranch 💀😂😂
i just wanna talk about how a mcchicken is $6.25 in australia...
This needs to happen all the time, they have such great delusional food conversations and man chemistry is made
You can’t beat the Big Mac.
Fun fact about the spicy chicken sandwiches, we are only supposed to put sauce on one side, but when you do that the sauce goes all over, its super messy, and it’s not fun. So people will put the sauce on and dab it onto the other bun to make it less messy!
Unpopular opinion the hash brown is one of the WORST McDonald’s menu items
I'm drinking a Pepsi watching this and it feels so much heavier just by watching someone bite into a cheeseburger
I love when these two do stuff... Ned and Korn are so boring. I would like to request a Eugene and Keith video w Kitchen & Jorn cuz they would make a wonderful video together.
Keith roasting the pope is truly gold 😂
26:02. 🤣👏
Patty Mayonnaise only eats cooking spray. Lmao. 🤣
Please more rank the menu
I love their energy together so much
THE MICHELLE OBAMA PART LMFAOAOAOAO
mcgriddles are still the number one from mcdonalds!
The sad no that left my mouth and Keith's mouth when Eugene moved down the hashbrown for the Big Mac
The Hot n Spicy McChicken is the BEST. I was very disappointed that not many other states than Colorado have it… 😅
MORE MORE MORE Rank The Menu!
Did ned and Zach leave try guys???
It’s so weird seeing all this regular plastic.
all the Catholics i know are fruity
The fact that Eugene didn't get the names in unison ONE single time is what I came here for! The best!
part of why the flavor of the fries is so distinct (at least in the US) is because they use beef fat in creating them! it’s also why stricter vegetarians can’t eat the fries in the US. However - most other countries do not use the beef fat and are suitable for vegetarians and vegans
They got rid of my fave lol I love the snack wrap
I hate the apple pie’s now. They are so small! They used to be so much more!!!!! 😢
To the man that said the McGriddle is disgusting he needs mental counseling
God Eugene is so wrong
They didn’t address it but Keith had like four bites of a lot of stuff
Why does “I’m right, you’re wrong open wide” sound so much more sinister
The mcchicken is almost 3 bucks here now. Fucking inflation 😭
As a picky eater who only likes the fries and nuggets as a meal from McDonald's, I am insanely happy and surprised that those are Top 2
I feel like they said JISM lmaoooo live forever stifflers  mom
what is this mcgriddle slander!
As painful as it is for you guys, I really need more of these!
McDonalds Fries are always bathed in Sugar.
Could you next time buy one and cut them into half it prevents food waste and safe money but anyway it’s good
Could you next time buy one and cut them into half it prevents food waste and safe money but anyway it’s good
You missed the Mcgangbang
If Keith is Carrie and Eugene is Samantha is Ned Miranda or Charlotte? What about Zach??
Keith looks like a younger version of my uncle. My uncles name is also Keith 😭
20:30 why did that sound so good 😭
Rate the menu taco bell
I don’t know what it is but I really like how these two are together. They play off each other’s energy so well
You guys should have Eugene use a speech jammer when he announces the names of items :)
AMERICANS DON'T HAVE THE ROYAL TS BURGER?? THAT'S THE BEST ONE
It's very interesting to see what American McDonald's has.
I just love the chaos that ensues when they've reached peak food intake 😂👏
They should of been drinking the sprite. It's spicy!
the hotcakes look like something i was served at the psych ward. and somehow the psych ward pancakes still looked better. very disappointing
The mcgriddle is a masterpiece. I feel personally offended
Can we please get a high rate the menu with Keith and Eugene?😩
Kieth: Introduces items in human language  Eugene: Introduces items in sim language
I feel the same way about the McGriddle.
hot take the #3 gose hard (as far as im aware the menu is relitivly the same everywhere)
I’ve watched this video so many times 😂😂 & i love it…but I just realized there was something else I needed ranked in this video…McDonald’s coke. They literally have the best coke. 😂
The apple pies r still fried in the uk.
Of all "burger fast food chains" McD has got to be the most boring in terms of the flavour of the bun and the patty aside from special limited time offers like the Swiss King etc. The permanent menu is just dull.
KEITH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEE DO COUNTRY FOODS! START FROM BRAZIL! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!
In Canada (or at least Ontario), McChicken is the main chicken sandwich on the menu. It’s way more major and impressive in all ways. What they’re eating is more like what we call a junior chicken. Funny eh?
I feel sad cuz they saying that the McChicken is Nasty and I like eating it 😭
No sausage egg McMuffin ?! Oh well great show
the fact that Eugene got none of the names right is just comedy gold
I wonder how Eugene would’ve felt about the Chicken McGriddle
I miss the McDonald's cinnamon melts
Eugene ranking the food as food of star signs will be nostalgic af hahahaha
In the philippines, they have the sausage egg-desal. The bread is so much softer (pan de sal) and the cheese is in the scramble egg so it’s not as weird rubbery. The pro move is put the hashbrown in the brekky sandwiches and some ketchup. :D
interesting,hot cakes
This should be a game mode
Whats the word they kept bleeping omg?
the fries are unique because they are breaded slightly. almost no other fast food restaurant does that
I think think it’s sad other states don’t have the spicy mc chicken year round
The sad thing is that Mc Donalds in Swizerland is as expensive as a normal restaurant. 16 franks for a mc chicken menu, like wtffff
the yellowjackets love <3
I was with you until the nuggets and the hamburger. The fries and hamburger are better than the nuggets.
I've got this really weird habit when watching the try guys I watch it once and then play it again and I'd like to fall asleep to the video Thanks   Try guys
The chicken nuggets are disgusting, you're lying to yourself if you think differently
(Is no one going to comment about how dumb America is re: quarter and 1/3 pound burger fiasco)
Lmao the ham on a McMuffin is not Canadian bacon 😅😭 what y'all call Canadian bacon is just ham, true Canadian bacon is like if you made bacon out of a pork chop
I feel that a Panera eat the menu would bring a lot of mixed emotions out of Keith.
mcgriddle w the round egg is an absolute mouth watering gift from god
The reason the spoon looks like a straw is because in McDonald’s they put the spoon in the mixing machine and it mixes it all and I know no one is commenting this I hate my self way more then anyone else hates me!
I want to see more rank the menu!
I absolutely loved Keith and Eugene working together for this episode of Rank the Menu and would absolutely love seeing more of them!!
I am from Texas and also hate ranch it absolutely is a trauma issue
The filet o fish is unique as it’s one of the things on the McDonald’s menu that sort of taste like food and not ‘McDonald’s’.  The chicken nuggets taste the least like food, chicken does not rats like that, and the most like just some weird McDonald’s thing, but they are good.
All day breakfast ended at the beginning of the pandemic. :(
Wait, they don’t do a triple cheese burger in McD’s America? Lol We have it over here (Uk).  We don’t have the hot fudge though, I’m sad. & your Apple Pies look bigger than ours, and different looking too layer, I’m jealous. (I’m guessing ours are still fried, that’s how they taste anyway).  I love the Pancake breakfast from McDonalds, pancakes that you call hot cakes? And a Sausage patty with maple syrup over the top in a tray!
Watching this drunk is trippy lol
I agree completely with this ranking, EXCEPT for the mcgriddle.  It deserved to be just before the Filet-o-fish!
Why is that grown man taking baby ass bites and why would he think he has the privilege putting THE MCGRIDDLE that low.
I am a big fan of just the sausage McGriddle with no egg or cheese because then it feels like yummy pancakes and sausage
We don’t torture cows lmaoo
i work at mcdonalds and i must say the best food is off the menu, for example, the mcchicken is rly good if you make it with big mac sauce, lettuce, pickles, and cheese lol
''Baby people'' 😭
I just realized they didn't have the biscuit breakfast sandwiches but oh well.
I literally am sitting with my mcchicken and fries rn watching this and feel betrayed
The coke comes in aluminum tanks, not plastic bags, which maximizes the flavor. That's why it tastes better.
I can’t wait until Zach and Ned find they’re crazy crossover that goes this hard cuz then I will not have any excuse to stop watching this channel  This comment didn’t age according the plan
How about KFC fries 😂
As a Canadian I can say that the bacon on the classic egg McMuffin is NOT Canadian bacon at all, that's just ham. Canadian bacon is also known as peameal bacon and has cornmeal as a crust on it, it's delicious.
The McGriddle is a hangover food
I whole heartedly accept Eugene as the king of middle children. He is the perfect leader for us in my opinion.
Excuse me. I don't know where you're getting your pricing on the hash browns but they're basically $2.40 now, not a dollar.
Where is Keith getting $1 hashbrowns from McDonald's? It's like $2.50 or somewhere near that for 1
My MCGRIDDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have 4 hash browns with my breakfast. I know, I'm a heathen.
I lowkey love the Filet Fish
Can you do Jollibee menu with Eugene ranking it!
In there before times at the before place 😂😭
It's gunny to watch this because in my country the menu is sooo different and everything also tastes pretty good tbh. For macdonalds😂 its still macdonalds but it all tastes pretty good so yeah. It also looks a lot better here😂
I'll be honest, I hate the Hashbrowns. they are the greasiest things on the planet. I can drench an entire Napkin trying to sop up the grease in a hashbrown, and the hashbrown will still have enough grease in it to make me feel sick. So just to clarify. I hate it because of the grease and because it makes me feel sick, NOT Because I hate the taste. it do taste pretty good
this made me realise how different mcdonalds is in different countries… people love the McChicken and McGriddles in singapore
Nice!
The impressive thing about Macdonalds eggs if they make it in house. The disappointing thing about Macdonalds eggs is that it's actually impressive they crack eggs at the restraunt.
the mcgriddle tastes better with just the sausage
Egg, cheese, sausage croissant 🦃🧀🍳🥐
Two tops flirting with nowhere to go. ❣️
but...strawberry sundae?
11:58 you need to get it without lettuce. Those lettuce shreds are horrendous.
In Hawaii we still get the fried apple pie. 😍
I like the color matching to the pillows
Ohio banned the bradford pear tree.
I adore the hotcakes. Probably mostly for nostalgia reasons. When I was little, if I didn't have school, my grandma would take me to work with her and we'd get McDonalds hotcakes on the way. I'm 29 and I'll probably always eat the hotcakes, especially when my grandma is eventually no longer with us cuz they taste like happy memories.
9:59 Not the caption saying "Eugene Liang" like he's not famously Korean and proud of it LOL
Eugene: Do you feel any differently about it (double quarter pounder with cheese)?  Keith: It makes me have to gasp for air. Why is that so funny!?
the fact that they ranked the sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle as anything other than THE best item is a war crime
Chicken wrap will forever be the best item from McDonald’s. Rip
You’re so wrong putting the mcgriddle down there
"Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic"
I am from Texas and that is so true ranch is the best sauce in the entire world!!!! I eat it on everything!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Eugene: If you eat this, it should be the only thing you eat all day  …not me who always orders 2 McGriddles 😂
"unless this does really well" hehehe
There was this one time me and my dad went to McDonald's, waited for like an hour in the drive threw to get out food, we got a big mac, nuggets, and fries for both, and we didn't check the bag, we got 2 big macs and 2 filet o fish, neither me or my dad like fish and I don't like bigmacs so I had to make something else when I get home and I was so sad
Eugene, Rank the Jollibee menu with Keith please!!!
what exactly did i do what exactly did i do
Am I the only one who hates eggs? 🤨.
If ever in Hawai'i get the fried apple pies! and try the haupia (coconut custard) pie too!
It went really well
No they mcgriddle it’s better than the rest of breakfast options they had. But I get a sausage and cheese Mc riddle
As he talks ranch ...I'm from Texas and I'm dousing my carrots in ranch atm 🤣🤣🤣
Mcgriddle is a high mid item
Eugene: "I would seek this out... if i was drunk"  Keith: "When I'm drunk I eat a rotisserie chicken"
But you forgot the double big mac burger 🍔
Watched the Taco Bell episode so wanted to see this one. Eugene explaining the cheese in Filet o Fish was very elementary school kid confidence. 😂
sausage mcgriddle without egg and cheese is good!!! but with its too much.
So, I work for Lowes part time this last  winter. For what it’s worth, every single person in between my position and the CEO was a person of color and they weren’t all men either. Problem though, as a business owner Lowes doesn’t have everything I need in quantity ever. Home Depot does. Kind of stinks
You should eat the McDonald’s menu again as that would be cool
naur bc i actually love the mcdonalds pancakes 😭
We need a whataburger version. Just to make people more mad
Loved Eugene’s SNL Maya Rudolph “not beef” reference!
Unpopular opinion, I don't like mcdonalds fries lmao they're too salty to me and I prefer soft fries over crunchy fries
I'd like to see you guys do either BK or, dell 🌮
these are my favorite videos
McDonalds spicy food is never spicy, except the signature collection The Spicy One but they don't do it anymore DX
Keith is giving me Pete Davidson vibes 😂
THEY DIDNT TRY THE MCDOUBLE!!! ITS A DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER WITH ONE CHEESE INSTEAD OF TWO! WHYYYY
Not the point, but the staging of this video is so aesthetically pleasing.
I feel like if they keep doing this collaborative show, which I hope they do, instead of saying "gibberish" Eugene should try saying the names of the foods in Korean!! Fun idea!! You guys should TRY it! Lol 😆 love you guys 🥰
Would be nice to have the not squeaked language versions available for us in the older audience.
Fish filets are the best! Underrated
Hm. I wonder if the Daily Double is a local thing or didn't exist at the time. It's basically a small, two patty with cheese, mayo of all things, lettuce and tomato, which I didn't know McDonald's had. And it costs just a bit more than a Mcdouble for all those veggies! I think they would have liked it.
Where's the bucket?
the strawberry pie is AMAZING
I'd say 2.87 million views is well PLEASE do another one
Eugene trying not throw up eating that “nugget cakes with ranch” 😂😂
Nugget > Hashbrown > Fries > Mcflurry > Sausage mcmuffin w/ egg. Nothing else is worth ordering at McDonald. And never order McDonald without using their app. The deals make them a lot more reasonable like the 20piece nugget with two free large fries.
How can you eat any of this without ketchup
What is a mcchicken? Is that like the hot n spicy chicken?
The mcgriddle is amazing haha
so are they eating these things… cold?
“Get the cheese guys, get the cheese” Me: cries in intolerant to McDonald’s cheese… ok Eugene🥲
Ned is Charlotte, Zach is Miranda, Keith is Carrie and Eugene is Samantha!
The mcgriddle is the best drunk/hangober food
The go to is Big Mac and Fish sandwich order of fries everything else can disappear maybe the double cheeseburger for a third place
Anyone else miss the butterfinger mcflurry?
You’re entitled to your opinion, but as for myself—YUCCccHHHH!  The greasy fries, the Big Brick, and that nasty double cheese would plunge to the bottom of the list.  The Crispy Chicken, and the Filet O’ Fish are serviceable if you take a Nexium first.
the quarter pounder debate reminds me of when i used to work at a maccas and someone ordered a whole pounder bc he wanted 4 patties in it LOL
Loving Eugene smelling his fingers!!!
The Patties at McDonald’s may be thin- but you haven’t seen a ritzys burger- they are thinner than a piece of paper. Two of them equals half of a McDonalds patty
They gotta do another episode with this platform and just switch shows with rhett and link and say absolutely nothing about it
I've never understood the McGriddle. I tried one once and I never wanted another
I too have noticed the smell of Bradford pear trees. It is, not good.
23:10  You really need to buy a heating lamp that will keep the food warm
Wt does it say about us who genuinely, thoroughly find joy , comfort and entertainment from this content ?
I need more rank the menus!! You two make me cackle
McGriddles are literally so good but without the egg and cheese you just only need the sausage lol
McFlurries are my FAVORITE thing ever
I hope I meet someone with the last name of dipitis
The hotcakes do a lot better when you eat them with the sausage patty, they help balance each other out.  They still don't deserve any higher than 19 though
I just realized why i love keith and eugene so much im both from tennessee and texas lol
If you have an oven set it to 65 degrees Celsius and put your food in there. That's what restaurants do 👍
hot cakes at are my mcdonalds breakfast of choice :( to be fair i hate mcdonalds breakfast
I’m from Texas and I hate ranch 🤷🏻‍♀️
Technically, the fries shouldn't be listed under the "not beef" items because they have meat additives in them.  Also, Eugene should rank more of Keith's previous Eat the Menu items.
The best thing is the quarter pounder with Mac sauce
I wish the hashbrowns were $1 they’re $2.19 each 😭😭
I'm with Eugene, not a huge ranch fan. It's ok but it's too creamy and gaggy for me.
Is so funny how Keith in all Eats the Menu shows starts with lots of energy and ends looking like he is drunk with food hahahahahaha!
OMG IM SO SAD. I FREAKING LOVE THE MCGRIDDLES :((((
I want to go to the ocean and just see cheese floating around
mcflurries are just bootleg blizzards
The caramel frappe tho
I was prepared to be annoyed at the final rank after he pooed on McGriddles, but the rest of the list is pretty solid.
Please do another ranking
Eith.
Again....can Keith please hide his gay hands! Gruesome.
They still deep fry the apple pies at McDonald's where I live. lol Then again, I'm from England, so maybe the baked apple pie is just an American thing, idk.
Watching this as I eat a Burger King Whopper at 2AM.
Can the try guys do the secret menu versions of different restaurants?
Yes i want more rank the menus! Also mcgriddles r better without the eggs idk why they just are
Mmm pepperoni and green chile pizza with some hidden valley ranch? Mmmm.
silly comfortable goofy Eugene warms my heart aww i love him. i feel like we would be great gal pals lol i'm a lesbian btw for context. i appreciate his beauty but not for me ANYWAYS this video is hilarious and comfortable
this was really funny! definitely better than the "episode that must not be named"
Best item is a quarter pounder with added big mac sauce. Although I only eat Maccas once every few years so the number of items from the menu I've actually tried is around 6.
ok....... please tell me you guys are high!!!!!!  love this combo
20 McNuggets and a big bag of french fries is the only thing I ever buy at McD 😂  As a kid, I was convinced I didn't like any burgers because I hated all the burgers I tried at McD 😅 I think I was in my teens when I reluctantly tried a non-homemade burger for the first time and liked it. It totally blew my mind😂 still hate the burger quality at McD, tho, so only ever gonna order the nuggies
THE MCFLURRY IS SO GOOD!
JUSTICE FOR THE MCGRIDDLE!
Dairy Queen has a butterfinger blizzard
Texan here, who tf puts ranch on ice cream?!
McGriddles deserve better.
M&M McFlurrys are my favorite thing they tried today 😋
I am dyingggg at Eugene just spitting out some mumbo jumbo when Keith is announcing the next food item!
The only McDonald's breakfast that my husband will eat is the hotcakes. But I definately agree with Eugene, they aren't good.
This video is so crazy I love it so much.
The McDuffie egg, is an actual cracked egg the mcds workers have to cook. The folded egg comes like that. The scrambled is in a carton that you'd pour and then scramble.
this is so wrong how is the fish filet better than my mcchicken
hotcakes breakfast are my favorite! 😭😭
Keith: there’s no other burger like this on the market The big boy: am I a joke to you?
The mcgriddle should not have the option to put an egg on it, so gross! Sausage only mcgriddle is bomb though.
Hashbrowns should go first they are better than all the other items even when cold the second is McNuggets and fries third
Ya'll forgot the breakfast burrito!!
keith is so uncomfortable with the m u c talk…. he needs to get it together and support eugene in his ventures lol
Favourite thing to watch when litty
Yellowjackets is getting so much promotion for free😂
I really like the filet o fish😂
Does it really smell like semen? 😂
i get Keugene is the cuter name buT FOR RANK THE MENU?? EEITH* WAS RIGHT THERE  *: sounds like "Eat" but with an H sound at the end
"I have a needle in my bag *for selling things*". And I have questions.
"I could pour water on your face as I jab you with a needle"
For anyone who is curious and doesn't want to look it up, the McFlurry spoons have hollow handles bc that's what they hook up to the machine to mix them up.
Rhett and link would disagree with you about the mcgriddles
Haha, little did they know this would be a new series spin-off 😄.
Rank king vs Drunk vs high eat the menu
I love how much you make each other laugh :D
Fried apple pies disappeared from every fast food joint that sold them waaaay before anyone ever even heard of Michelle Obama - probably in the late 80s or maybe even earlier (although I think they're still available in some places overseas). I'm not a huge fast food fan but those fried pies were so freaking good. Blistery, flaky, thin crust enveloping saucy sweet cinnamony tender diced apples - OMG. You had to be careful because they were always volcanically hot and molten inside. Fried apple pies re-surfaced at KFC briefly some years ago and  Taco Bell offered something similar in the form of a Caramel Apple Empanada, but I'm pretty sure they're both gone again. I haven't been in either fast food place in a long time so I don't know for sure.
Where is the big tasty it’s literally the best beef burger ever
Rewatching this and still laugh how Eugene doesn't even try to say the names right lmaoo
And then you say, “no middle, please”!
yesssss eugene coming thru for the middle children
It’s bone, ball, boot, and bell on 14:40
Justice for McGriddle
Booo that Eugene ranked the McGriddle so low. I agree that the pancakes are trash.
Frick.... Eugene singing turns me on...
mcchicken + cheese is a go to for me, add the cheese!
When the double quarter pounder came out, it was cheaper then the big mac (at least by where I lived as a kid).  But, me and my friends loved big macs so much.  Then we discovered that you could order the double quarter pounder with lettuce and big mac sauce at no extra cost.  That is what we lived on for I don't even know how long.  Tasted exactly like a big mac, was half the price and it was happy food for the soul.
I adore the fact that Eugene immediately gave up actually trying to say the item along with Keith. 😂
Please make this a new series
I love that you guys wore the colors haha
Kind of sad I have never eaten Mcnuggets because of my allergies :(, but the french fries are the best!
Hungry Jack's original crispy fried chicken burger is amazing.  A thicker piece of chicken with a great sauce and lettuce.
Keith is totally right about the McGriddle
Y'all should try McDonalds in other countries! India McDonalds is soooo good
Eugene has the nicest hands.
32:16 final menu rank
new drag name alert! Sharon-Dipitous
i saw a tiktok from an ex employee who said when they got trained they told them that when u open the package of (specifically!) quarter pounder meat it changes colors! sounds like a valid thing to throw up over
Never related more to being a middle child 😬🖤
my first fast food experience was a frosty
A lie that he says he hasn’t had breakfast that long bullshit
What was the squeak?
Hot and spicy is elite 🌶
One day can you please film the "after" portion of these try the menus and show Keith's recovery at home with Becky, it would be pretty interesting to see what you go thru each time you make these for us (and I can identify as I have overeaten and remember the pain!)
LMAO yes!!! Those Bradford Pear trees are something else! Every year I'm like, oh yup... There's that smell! 😂😂
"best to least best"
The Big Mac's bun is made from a taller bun and they cut it into thirds.
need to stop talkin about D with the menus gross
Keith is so high 🤣
They still fry them in places like Germany. Delicious still
Being an old McDonalds worker, I never liked the apple pie by itself. However, if you get a fresh apple pie, break it in half into a little bowl, and put soft serve directly on top, it was so freaking good.
6:32...yes Eugene, the neighbors had one. At 17 when I mentioned to my mom what it smelled like...she was shocked/dismayed/disappointed...all with a laugh  :)
Sea cheese.
I was listening to this kinda like a podcast n did a whole double take when Eugene mentioned Injera. His knowledge of other cultures never fails to impress me. As an Ethiopian fan, I love that he’s eaten injera before and knows abt it
remember when eugene didnt remind u he was gay 50 times in the same video, me too, good days
considering the top three are the only things I'll eat from McDonalds I'd say I'm not surprised.
Fun fact but quarter pounders in the US are all freshly prepared and MADE TO ORDER since 2018b
4:27 Eugene no! lol 16:43-16:52 My sister use to drown her burritos in ranch as a kid which kind of ruined it for me. I can only really stand it on salad now lol 17:29-17:38 I remember that ep!!  20:28-20:32 YES! <3 27:59 LMFAO
I had nuggets in new York  and they were sooooo different then Canadians nuggets in such a bad way. Are they better in other states ? It was the first time I really understoood the pink sludge videos. In Canada it tastes like real chicken.
Hi there Keith and Eugene. Did you know that the "hot fudge" is not generic, It's actually Hershey's chocolate syrup. Also most of mky D's sauces, etc. are made by Kraft foods. That includes the cheese also. P. S. I love y'all's channel. I literally wind up binge watching every time I put one of your shows on. Love you guys
new wendys fries > Mcdonalds fries
BRING BACK THE SNACK WRAP
Shoulda put syrup instead of ranch on that last item.
Eugene: Yeah, but like, a lot of companies started out with really bad stuff. *Like us* Gotta love that BuzzFeed shade 😂
Yeah cause im so catholic🤡🤡
Mccdouble
A big Canadian PLEASE! Stop calling whatever that sliced ham is, "Canadian Bacon". If you want to try actual Canadian Bacon go for Peameal Bacon. That would be the closest actual thing to "Canadian Bacon".
I just watched this video . Keith asked how they do the middle bun, that is “not a bottom bun”… My family’s bakery in Guam supplies the buns for all McDonalds on the island. The middle bun is exactly that. We bake a taller bun.  Then we run the baked buns through a slicer to cut it in half. The slicer for the Big Mac has 2 blades and slices it into thirds.
i miss the snack wraps. and the mcskillet burrito for breakfast.
I think that about the cow milk all the time
Arizona is the only place I have seen the SPICY McChicken and it is1000% better
biscuit is way too high
I would love to see another rank the menu this is beyond hilarious.
So mcdonalds has a deal with coca cola, and as such they have specific formulas for their soft drinks and syrups that make them more intense and "fresher" than the canned products
i will not stand for this McChicken slander
Canadian here. Wtf is hotcakes? Those are pancakes.
The pies are still fried in Hawaii 👍🏼👍🏼
I LOVE the SNL reference, 'could it be beef?' 'I think it could be beef!'
Eugene: When I was a young… Keith: Warthog… Eugene: *tenor mode activated*  🤣
Not the slander of Tennessee's education lol. I can relate
Granted, the recipe is different in Australia, our McDonald fries don't contain animal fat but they're so gross. I genuinely don't understand why anyone likes them.
Please do an update on your YelllowJackets opinions. I need it please
the mcgriddle is awesome (as long as there is no egg...)
I would like to see another rank the menu
Lmao that Samantha quote was EVERYTHING 😆
Mcgriddles are my fav!!
we need the whole series of these now! Wendys, Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC what have i missed
The McGriddle Sandwich would be BETTER or much higher rank than the other McDonalds items if they exchange that folded nasty egg with the fresh egg that is served on the McMuffin Sandwiches instead 😋💯.
Filet o fish is the best
Wait wait wait, McDonalds in America doesn't have the Big Tasty?? Or the amazing dessert cakes?? WHAT THE FUCK. You guys would have LOVED the Big Tasty, it's SO GOOD.
Eugene and Keith are perfection together.... please please please duo again
I think the hashbrowns should be first then fries after that I don't care lol
Please no more eugene
I'm glad yall finally stopped eating behind each other I wonder what happened...aahh the gross old days...lol
Pro tip: if you want the perfect balance of flavours, order a Big Mac with ONE extra patty (so, not a double Big Mac) and ONE extra slice of cheese.  No other changes.  You're welcome.  :)
I like how eugene said theyd go back to the mcgriddle amd they DIDNT! loo
were they drunk or high during this lmao
Mcgriddles are my favorite thooooo lmfaoo. I throw a hash brown in there with some ketchup. It slaps fr 🤣
I am dying at Keith singing “Warthoggggg” 😂😂😂
i feel bad for americans, your mcdonalds suck
As someone who can’t eat stuff like this anymore, it’s strangely pleasurable to watch you guys and listen to your descriptions.
I'm just here to watch Eugene lose the power of speech every time he's supposed to introduce a new item with Keith 😂
it took me 32 minutes of this video to realize they are wearing Mcdonalds colors
I put McDonald's lettuce right there with Taco Bell's lettuce. Saying you'd want it on the Filet-o-Fish is sus.
When I worked at McDonald's my favorite thing was a filet of fish with pickles on it
Without the styrofoam egg on all of those breakfast ideas
The McGriddle was my go to in college 🥹
Fudge can stay in the semi liquid form., lol
Keith gagging on the mcnuggetcake with ranch was the best ending I could've hoped for.  Thank you for struggling through that monstrosity for all of us.
can we do a big rank to find out which number one food is the number onest
Seeing you guys make me miss what I lost when I leave all my friend and decide to start somewhere  else ,I always believe u can be successful  no matter where u go ,but I miss my old life. You guys are so lucky to have each oher😔😔😔😔
Loved seeing the menu RANKED as much as Keith probably hates eating all of this again
As someone who enjoys the fish sandwich on occasion OUTSIDE OF LENT SEASON it was quite refreshing to see it acknowledged as surprisingly decent. XD
I would watch this if they did it more often.
when Okra starts to go bad... it smells like 💦🤣
The McChicken must not be the same as Canada’s junior chicken because that thing slaps.
Hot take: mcdonalds fries are awful.  Edit: the fries have beef flavoring so the "not beef #1" is technically wrong.
Eugene just saying random syllables instead of introducing the food should not have been as funny as it was….. But it REALLY was 😂😂 every single time I was on the edge of my seat! What’s he gonna say next??
They should just have called this Eugene being obsessed with the white sticky stuff for 34 minutes 😩
I honestly dont think mcnuggets should be in first, the mcchicken has better tasting chicken, the nugget batter gets soggy the longer they sit because of the steam from the nuggets, and theyre honestly the worst fast food nuggets you can buy.
I work at mcdonolds and Omg it’s so different from the uk
I can’t believe the bagels didn’t even place! That breakfast sauce is mmmf 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I actually know why the fries taste so good. So way back in the day, the fries were fried in beef tallow (fat). When they got busted for doing that, they switched to a beef tallow flavored peanut oil. It’s that beef flavor that makes them good
Mcgriddles are terrible, unless you ask them for a round egg, those are the fresh made ones instead of the frozen ones they just heat up. Then the mcgriddle is God tier
Combine the McChicken and the McDouble and you get a McBitchin
Awesome shout out to Emily Zugay.  She is one of my favorite TikTok follows.
give us another fucking Rank the Menu already!!!!!!
keith’s humor is UNHINGED in this one😂
Justice for the McGriddle!
Now I cant stop imagining injera pancakes and if they would actually be good.
plz do another rank the menu with keith and eugene 😭 i love this so much lol
The brotherly love vibe slaps! This video was wonderful!
THERES GONNA BE SOME MCGRIDDLERS IN HERE.   you’re right 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
should rank the sauces too
I know it’s been said before, but eugene has blossomed and become so happy and it’s just perfect 😍
I always get the hamburger when I go to McDonald’s, it’s a CLASSIC
I just ate a wholeee 10 piece nugget meal and it's been a hot second and I'm starting to think I'm too old to be eating like this lol idk how they do it
I want you guys to come to Vancouver canada so you can try White Spot !
LOOOOVED THE CROSSOVER
I agree with Eugene Ranch is overrated
For real, the filet-o-fish is my go to during lent😂😂😂
You should eat the menu at Terranea Resort!!!
Justice for McGriddle! But the bacon version, not sausage. It will hold me over for at least 8 hours. :D
My Keep 5, Toss the Rest, ranked.  1. McNuggets 2. Double Cheeseburger 3. Fries 4. Big Mac 5. Hot Fudge Sundae
I wish McDonald’s would bring back the Bacon Cheddar Mcchicken!
I really hope their outfits were planned. they look like ketchup and mustard! :)
Ok has anyone had the sausage pancake on a stick? That’s delicious that is what the McGriddle is just with cheese! It’s soo good!
Keigene Keith and Eugene combine
I love the hotcakes 😭
i think the chicken nugget taco at the end would've been better with the syrup as opposed to the ranch
More of these two doing this everywhere else pls
research  McD soaks their fries in salt and tons of Sugar   the sugar krisps them  chew with your mouth closed
people should grow up on Farms   a Chicken having an Egg is a Chicken having her Period   thats why some eggs have spots of Blood    if they have sex  the Egg comes out and  you warm it   and get a Chick    Growup guys
And we over here have mc flurry's with a cardboard spoon in a tiny cardboard box.  This is not okay
didnt they do the cheeseburger twice
I always have the hot n spicy mcchicken and add big Mac sauce and it's life changing 🤣
I’m sorry…Eugene’s laughs at 27:52 and 27:59 were SO FUCKING CUTE 😭😭😂😂
Actually the fries do contain beef. It's weird.
I always go for the double cheese burger NOT the McDouble & a medium fry. Perfection ✨
Never ate a mcgriddle until my 30s and the description of soft Styrofoam fits.
Please more Keith/Eugene content!!!
The mcgriddle is single handedly the best fast food breakfast invention There ever was, and probably ever will be
I order a big Mac take out the pointless DRY middle bun and replace it with a hashbrown 🙌
More Rank the Menu!!!!
Aw man. I love their hot cakes. :( I love how they taste so sweet. HAHA. Their texture is great, imo.
16:40 EXACTLY. I eat ranch on wings thats it
Wait, US quarter pounders don’t automatically come with cheese?😧
I always bought the McChicken and added cheese to it, then I'd dip it in Hot Mustard. I ate one the other day and it wasn't very good 😕
I think the best thing about this episode. Is how excited Eugene feels having a solo video with Keith. It's so fucking wholesome. Glad Eugene knows his friends love him as much as he loves them
I love the humor
No because the quarter pounder tastes like a pillar of salt.
And eugene used the word “torture “ literally was not expecting them to be so light with the words of choice they used
One thing made me sad in whole video is that they made a joke about double dipping an animal ,its really dark joke and also cruel ,yes we are not vegan but at least acknowledge the process of skinning ,cutting and frying an animal for it to go into our stomach,theres really nothing to joke about this unless you are not human anymore 😔😔😔😔 and also in other videos i saw keith hugging the cows
eugene lee yang famous for being catholic underrated line
So did the sales of hot fudge sundaes tank, or rise dramatically after this video?
Eugene: Samantha Keith: Carrie Ned: Charlotte Zac: Miranda
My current favorite Mcdonalds sandwich is the Quarter Pounder Deluxe. My overall favorite sandwich is the Angus Deluxe and my second favorites are either the Big Mac Wrap or the Angus Deluxe Wraps.
we eat that in philipines
Hawaii McDonald’s has fried apple pies. Also a lot more on our breakfast menu 😂
I can't have McDonald's anymore. But my old order would be a small fry, fresh, a mc double and a snack wrap with ranch and of course a sprite, if I didn't have a shake. I'd put the fries in the burger, devour it like that, eat the snack wrap that was crispy, then finish off the fries and the drink, so good.
A egg McMuffin... better than a Bacon Egg and Cheese Biscuit?  >:(
I called it the Russian special, get 2 McDonald’s hash browns and put it on an egg bagel with butter. Ate them all the time as a child and it’s probably taken 10 years off my life. No ragrets
Oh Eugene you fine man
to whom it may concern: add hot fudge to a mcflurry for like 50¢
"When I'm drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken" ME
This crossover episode is amazing
Not having the sausage egg mcmuffin with cheese is a true shame!
4:44 When Keith dropped that McGriddle😂🤣
I think that was one of the best videos, and would love another rank the menu with these two!
Ok, this was a lot of fun!  Eugene just constantly mumbling whatever it is he said instead of the actual menu items.  Also interesting to see all the things we just don't have. The hashbrown recently came on the menu over here (or, they were at some point, not sure if that was permanent).  Honestly, these two were visibly having a lot of fun. That just makes it soo much fun.  Also, don't worry Eugene, as a german I totally don't get the american obsession with ranch. Tried it, it's fiiiine, but like... as a salad dressing or maaaaybe rarely as a dipping sauce, but... uh well. Not the best thing ever.  Also, yes cheese just makes everything better. That's a rule of life.  And I wanna say I love it when Eugene says something and then he himself makes a face at the words leaving his mouth and is like 'nope, that's not how I wanted that to sound.' Just something so funny about that.  That 'I have a needle in my bag... you know, for sewing' bit was also kinda great. Because at first that was just like.... what, why? But a sewing needle makes sense probably. Can never hurt to have one!
Do a cocktail ranks with Keith
I dont like you Keith.. you are annoying - but in realness, complete honesty - Id rather watch your videos than 99% of the shitfest that is on here.  You at least entertain.. and occasionally make me smile.    - signed Grouchy Old Man
I’m Ethiopian and I’m really surprised that Eugene knows about injera
The apple pie looks like the egg sac/pod that a cockroach lays.
More rank the menu
Eugene Lee Yang ;)
i definitely recommend asking for mayonnaise on the chicken sandwich. whole other level
eugene thank you for being the king of middle children ~ from a middle child
The next time y'all do this: do Whataburger, preferably, in Texas  Please and thank you 🤠
as a Texan i would like to see Eugene rank Whataburger and see Keith get a second chance at their food.
Please do 'Rank the Menu' again!
Eugene sounds like a sims character 🤣
I loooove eat the menu and rank king, this is the perfect combo! Loved the video
I’ll never get past loving these two together
I have a strong hatred against McDonald’s breakfasts
I randomly thought about the Try Guys ranking McDonald's and then this was posted only about a month ago. I am not lying.
hotcakes > you
We need a second try video of the try guys as their sex and the city counterparts!
I swear fealty to the king of middle children 👑
The McGriddle is the greatest invention in fast food history and I will die on that hill
i was expecting for keith to put keith sauce in the pancake nuggets
I'll say it! i'll be the pariah! Mcnuggets are mid!!
Def want more rank the menu!!!
I love the Keith and Eugene duo! We want more rank the fast food/restaurant!!!
McDonalds fries are soaked in beef (fat I think) and genuinely that's why they taste so good!! It does make them not vegan or even vegetarian but sooooooo good!
Wish I could triple like so they’d make more of these…
I like how they match with the pillows
I wish Eugene would do all of the eat the menus with Keith now
WHERE ARE THE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES????? 😭
Eugene Liang, Famous Internet Catholic...I DIED. :P <3
I love the McGriddle, but I like to substitute the scrambled egg with the round egg. The scrambled egg is NOT GOOD lol
I just like Eugene's background. he's a gay, Asian, catholic from texas. AWESOME!
Don't you have the quarter pound blt burger in the US? We have it here in canada and it is awesome!
hana, dul, set!
So...."sea cheese". That is all.
They are missing one of the best items at McDonalds... The SAUSAGE egg McMuffin!  Easily top 3.
McDonald's needs to bring back all day breakfast! Sometimes I want a McGriddle for dinner! Otherwise my go to is the Filet-o-Fish...I don't like McDonald's burgers. Nuggies are pretty good too.
Breakfast biscuit should have been last
M&M mcflurries are my jam when I'm drunk!
MORE RANK THE MENUE
Sausage McGriddle is on another level dude
I keep coming back to this video. Would love more like this! Really really enjoyed it.
Watched this earlier but, just ate in a Culver's parking lot and thought ya'll should get/rent an RV and take Rank The Menu on the road and go to fast food chains that don't operate in California, like Culver's White Castle Steak n shake Lee's Chicken. Eugene   can give us a taste of Texas and Ned can show off the good ol' Midwest. Can rank BBQ styles. Can even get into side rankings like best onion rings fries biscuits Mac and cheese.
This was great. Keith, you’re my favorite. Someone please draw Keith with apple pies for arms.
McDonald’s is the toxic relationship I know I need to leave but can’t. Lol.
The Sara N. Dipidus reminded me of that one episode from glee where Brittany doesn’t want to sing Brittany Spears songs because she is also named Brittany S. Pierce 😂😂😂
Team Mcgriddles
Go international!! McDonald's in Japan...
bacon mcgriddles>
In Canada we have A&W restaurants and its the best fast food for real
I fucking HATE the McGriddle. I also like the fillet of fish though so 🤷🏼‍♀️
Mc Donald’s have only 2 edible’s things that are hash brown number 1 , 2nd vanilla cone 🍦 and 2 more things but it’s good only if it’s fresh just fried at the moment that are chicken nuggets and fries 🍟
I broke my 10 years of vegetarianism to try mcnuggies and I was very surprised that they tasted like cardboard. I do not get the hype. I wanted to!
Love rank the videos
johnathan always just knows the most random things
i love this duo they work so well of each other, one chaotic neutral one chaotic evil
the c*m jokes were the highlight of this video
When I was young I just couldn’t remember what the hash browns were called, so I called them ovals
constructive critic here, the background music is too loud in comparison to their voices, its a little too loud
"Eugene Lee Yang: famous internet Catholic"
American mcdonald burgers look so sad lol, at our Mcdonalds we get fresh tomatoes, lettuce, onions and more. The meat we get does not look fake it is real beef and real chicken breasts
the bell the ball the boot and the BLING!
that was great, loved it so much, brought me lots of joy🥰
I feel like 90% of the other stuff on the McDonald's menu besides the burgers, nuggets and the egg McMuffin are just there for show, no one really eats them or orders them ever.
I’m really enjoying Keith in this color.
I completely disagree. The McGriddle is the BEST breakfast item on the menu. Hands down. It needs to be fresh out of the bag. Cannot be sitting around cold, that’s the issue with this comparison.
grilled chicken sandwich and friends milkshake s my name is heather ha
Do more and also rank the A&W menu! I'm pretty sure I got poisoned by their food tonight and I need your expert advice to show me where I went wrong
Definitely do more “rank the menu” vids , fun fact up here in Montreal Canada  they took me griddles off the mcd’s menus during the pandemic and haven’t brought them back yet 😢
No Eugene you were wrong hashbrowns are way better then the fries
Eat and rank the menu , CHICK FIL A
Watching this while eating my favorite sausage egg and cheese McGriddle with hash browns. 🤤
Eueith is a great ship name tho
Eugene Lee Yang: Famous Internet Catholic
instead of "keugene", i propose "euith" , pronounced "yeeth"
By video min21 they were fast food drunk. And its funny.
I love when Eugene laughs bc you Know its genuine
Also Trick/hack. If you have3 cold McDonald's warm it in a toaster oven. Burger, cheese burger, nuggies, fries. It all warms up SO WELL in a toaster oven. A microwave just kills it.makes it Hard.
My grandfather had a few McDonald's back in the day and his business partner was the guy who came up with Ronald McDonald. He also built the mansion that eventually sold to R Kelly that was featured in the R Kelly doc fm all the S slave stuff. We used to swim in that pool. Kinda crazy
I rarely eat McDonald's any more but when i do i get a hamburger happy meal with an extra hamburger plus 4piece nugg...6 if im stoned. And the first burger is always Bomb but halfway through the second i feel Bad
eugene im extremely upset about the apple pie.
Most of the time the machine isn't even actually broken. It usually just needs to be cleaned and they don't have time/don't want to do it.
Eugene ranking the McGriddle that low is blasphemy, cannot trust his tastebuds.
Big Mac is overrated as fug, boys.
I love the mcgriddles something about the syrup, just perfect hungover food but without the egg. I wish McDonald's didn't get rid of their biscuits and gravy that was my childhood.
the word they kept beeping was cum just in case anyone's curious lmao
COME ON IT'S A FREAKING PANCAKE SANDWICH YOU DON'T EVEN GOT TO PUT ANY SYRUP
Where did the original McDonalds eat the menu go? I can't find it
shoot I thought the bfast burritos at mc donalds were more popular... guess that's just me lol my nostalgia right there :P
The trick for McFlurrys is to get hot fudge added to it
Mcchicken is a dollar in america?! In the netherlanda we pay €4 wtf
keith gagging at 33:23 has me DYING
i didn’t expect a Yellowjackets shoutout but it was very nice
This was definitely the best of both worlds.
Love me a McGriddle 😂
I love the Filet-o-Fish!
Unpopular opinion: McNuggets are trash
Eugene: 하나, 둘, 셋 Subtitle: thought it was set
Love the cum discourse
I think you guys should make McDonald around the world...compare them coz we have mcflurry & sundae with Durians (hihi..)
Can u guys maybe do a ranking of all vegetarian and vegan fast food products across all chains?
Also, hi my favorite Capricorn ilyyy stink💕 Keith is the only Gemini man I trust with food, so sorry ned💀
This was pretty funny
Now I want more rank the menu's
“Before times. At the before place” Bruh
Eugene “King of middle children” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this a collab between *Eat the Menu* and *Rank king* ? 😂😂😂😂😂
I know the tree 🌳🥴😂
He's right, you're wrong, shut up!
Honestly the American McDonalds menu is so boring compared to every other country
The perfect mash-up. This made me so happy.
Love to see Eugene in a video with some of the other ‘guys’! Feels like it’s been a while !
JUSTICE FOR HOTCAKES
The little baby Try Guys!
Lame. mcgriddle is the best thing on the breakfast menu... other than hash browns. Either way it should be ranked higher lol
my favorite duo
Yes more rank the menu😀
First of all what the fuck kind of dumpy ass hot cakes are they serving at American McDonald’s to get this reaction second of all what the fuck kind of god tier level fries are they serving at American McDonald’s to get this response
Eat the menu dairyqueen!
Gotta have the double quarter pounder with cheese dressed like a Mac! Ooor a mcdouble dressed like a Mac! Best hack EVER
Canada needs the biscuits!!!!!! C’mon McDonalds!!
sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is my favorite item on the menu.
I swear to god this video is the new “yanny” or “laurel” Which one do you hear? “Sausage, egg and cheese McGriddle,” or “manumanamananatuboo”
Justice for McGriddle
justice for the mcchicken pls
McDonalds fries suppliers also par-fry them with Beef Seasoning - the fries used to taste better though they have changed from actual beef tallow and other oils as well. Also McRiddler sounds like awesome new McDonalds/DC Batman villian mashup
Breakfast burrito is where its at - but McD picante is garbage
"di-PEE-tous" 🤣🤣🤣
apple pies still deep fried in new zealand
Idk if its just me but i’ve been so used to Eugene gone that it feels odd seeing him their vids now...
All of the agents of chaos are going to give this as many likes as possible just to continue the suffering. I love it.
Whatever happened to the egg while delight😭
They should have just done two rows. One row for each of their best to worst
From Texas  I was also traumatized by ranch during middle school  I only started liking it again in my late 20s
Eugene not saying any of the titles when introducing a new food... Iconic but also yes Keith and Eugene videos are goated
Non ranch fans where you at- 👁👄👁
I literally go to places and ask for as much Ranch as they can legally give me.
there’s no way they weren’t high at during this it’s so great
Lol
This was fun 🤩
I’m so upset that they were able to get a mcchicken. I miss Mcchickens vs hot and spicy
I will say I love Kieth’s taco sauce, however it is FAR too expensive and you get WAY too little i found green dragon sauce from trader joe’s is a great substitute so my Kieth’s just sits on the bench waiting for special meals
Keith: "The Egg McMuffin" Eugene: "Da mur mur da gurber"
20:29 hold up i've never heard eugene sing before but my GOD they sound good together wtf
If a part two is done, may i please request the spicy chicken mcgriddle that shit is SO GOOD
Please do the Menu Hack items...  I don't want to try any of it.. but I would totally watch you guys eat it!
Keith is definitely the yellow wiggle that Australia needs
I love how Eugene just speaks in similar when they’re announcing the next item they’re eating lamo
I remember that SATC episode 😂😂😂 I can even imagine Samantha pronounce that entire sentence
Eat everything on the menu at kickin’ crab
Justice for McSpicys!
justice for hotcakes🥺
William H. Macy!
MORE MORE MORE!
The music is ALOT! Sounds like someone left the cartoons on in the background at times why is it so loud? Is it always this loud?! On a side note how many egg making machines does McDonald's have?? 😂
Eugene mentioned injera!!!!!
No the problem with the mcgriddle is that the only thing that should be in it is sausage and maybe egg if you really want it, cheese does not belong on it
Hotcakes are delicious!
Reflux: the movie
6:13 and suddenly.. Finnish Folk music? 😂
I never craved McDonald's more and I just had  a jaw surgery so I can't eat solid foods the next few days... I regret clicking on this video
Im a proud McGriddler and i feel offended that they got it with sausage and not bacon
Wait that's a McChicken in the US?? We call those Jr Chicken in Canada
I thoroughly enjoyed this Rank the Menu, it was so entertaining to watch! I definitely wouldn’t be mad if you did another video like this, but I’ll be watching Eat the Menu and Rank King regardless if you do or don’t😂
Keith eats everything at mcdonalds...keiths version?
and WHAT ABOUT THE BREAKFAST BURRITO????
Loved this but Filet of Fish should have ranked higher. It’s perfect.
Loved this!!! 😍
yessss i want more of this, it was hilarious and the chaos energy was top knotch!
I agree with Eugene on ranch. I remember how horrified I was the first time I saw someone dip pizza in it.
As a McGriddler, I think Keith fought hard enough for us so I will not complain in this comment section rn.  (also you should 100% do this again with another restaurant, it was amazing)
I feel like I’m watching a show where they auction off jewelry and spin is slowly while talking about how vintage it is 😭
hotcakes are so good🥺
mcgriddlers🤣🤣
eugene kinda looks like josuke from jojo's bizarre adventure
I love you both guys!! Always good vibes!!
I hate these videos (not really) because they make me crave specific foods, and then I remember not a single place delivers to my place 🤧
The c*m trees are actually dogwood trees, they are all over Atlanta. They are Georgia’s state tree I believe. Atlanta has a dogwood festival ever year.
Dunk McDonald’s fry’s in a chocolate milk shake.  Perfection
a freshly made egg mcmuffin with a soft bun is glorius, easily one of their best item.
I'm sad that the triple cheeseburger isn't on here lol. That, with extra cheese, add lettuce, add mayo, add bacon. Yum. Even if you get it as is, but with just the extra cheese, it's still much better. Cheesy goodness.
This was the crossover I never knew I always wanted
The crispy chicken from McDonald's is to compete with Chick FIL a not any thing to do with Popeyes sorry guy get facts straight 💯 👌
The fact that they have a company together and have no idea how each other’s shows work is amazing to me
Never been more embarrassed to be a McGriddle enjoyer... lol
Mcgriddle is best breakfast item 😋
I just want to hang out with the habers-lee yang-mcleans. Is that too much to ask???
my favorite thing from McD's is definitely their quarter pounder deluxe, I love having lettuce and tomato and mayo on my burger ^^
I feel like we need a new episode with the new mix ups on the McDonald’s menu! The Big Mac add mcchicken or filet o fish patty!
Where is the cookie
i forgot yall don't have deep fried apple pies- pie a la mode is the best
Anybody else trip when they zoomed in on the half piece of cheese?
Eugene: Samantha Keith: Carrie Ned: Miranda  Zach: Charlotte  💯
Definitely left out the salads this time.
They should make a Keith and Eugene rank all the menus where they take the best dish from each eat the menu video and rank it to see which dish is ultimately the best.
As a McGriddler, I support your decision despite how wrong you are. Keith, thank you for being a Griddle McStan.
THIS IS THE BEST COMBINATION OF MY TWO FAVS PLS DO MORE
Eugene getting drunk off the food before Keith is so funny😂😂
I have a confession. I am a McGriddler. There was a phase of my life where I dreamt of mcgriddles every night
Are they matching opposing pillows on purpose??
i really liked this video *throws cup on the ground* ANOTHER
the mcchicken was there for you when noone else was. it deserves to be in the top five at least
They do a double filet of fish. That’s my favorite. My son love the big mac
I would absolutely watch a Rank the Menu for Taco Bell. I feel like Eugene has some things to say about that.
my new favorite show and yoU SAY YOU WONT DO IT AGAIN WAH
I love hotcakes
I'm offended because the McGriddle is the best breakfast sandwich 'dons has ever made
Rank the menu again please
Where is the breakfast biscuits and gravy
There is something about Eugene and Keith that makes them the best duo in the Try Guys
Literally it's so weird seeing how their packaging and my countries packaging so very different
The fact that McDonalds sprite isn’t part of this rank, is insane. 😄
Guys, Keithene (she's the new Karen). She likes long walks and the lil' green aliens from Toy Story ;)
Definitely do more rank the menus! But the mic griddle was robbed
When I was in highschool I used to get a McChicken, McDouble, fries, and a drink for like 6 bucks
KIETH GOT SOME PLUMP LIPS MEOW
Quarter Pounder Deluxe is the best burger at McD's
I was in my (felt like) 30th month of pregnancy and wanted McDonald’s ice cream. So I texted everyone I knew about my craving. Cue six different friends arriving throughout the day with McFlurries and chocolate dipped cones.   24 hours later, I gave birth to my beautiful child. Kid apparently wanted to taste that ice cream herself. 😁😂
“Unless this does well”  *2.1 Million views*
I get my mcgriddles with round eggs
Eugene was not the right person who do this video with lol. God bless but he doesn’t strike me as a McDonald’s boy I think he’s a little too bougie lmao
I'm so sad they removed the Mc Gridle item from the menu since Covid here over whole Quebec also the mc chicken is good with more mayo and a full packet of black pepper
Eugene I love you and we normally agree with ranking. However, I love the Mcgriddle and it should have been higher on the list.
you should've done this when shamrock shake was in season!
Eugene your not funny, stop trying too hard!
what about the sausage burrito? that is my go to order at breakfast!!
McChickens are fire tf!!
Keith is Miranda, Eugene is Samantha, Ned is Charlotte and Zach is Carrie, yes or yes?!! 👀😂
More, please and thank you, this was hilarious !!!
You know- for a man named Keith... You sure are Frank, a lot... :p
Keith looks like Edmund kemper😂
eugene: lets come back to the mcgriddle  *proceeds not to come back to the mcgriddle :/*
I'm sad they took away All Day Breakfast menu where I'm at. Chicken McGriddles are so good!!! Actually have to get up before time is up to get it lol
A sausage McGriddle hot off the presses is delicious.  I said what I said.
if your *squeak* tastes like arrabiata PLEASE see a doctor
4:23 🤣 10:42 Chee-sea 23:46 "Why is the Fillet-O-Fish so high? That MF still swimming" made me think of Gordon Ramsey lol
Mcspicy is still, hands down, the best McDonald's burger I've had where I'm from and no one does it as good as them 😭
Y’all should try the Mcchicken but add cheese and pickles
Apparently theres a titanic 2 thats gonna set sail this year
I loved seeing Eugene getting grease drunk with Keith! I love these guys together!
i’ve missed keith and eugene vibing, i feel like we haven’t gotten since since the earlier days
please do more of these
Wow the try guys have been friends for 8 years...
"When I'm drunk, I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken". Never have I ever related to another human so much.
The annoying movment of camera. Who approved that??!!
I with Keith, I looooove the sausage mcgriddle👻😋
(20:26) Eugene: When I was a young- Me: BOY MY FATHER TOOK ME INTO THE CITY TO SEE A MARCHING BAND Keith: -warthog
Being a middle child myself it hit hard when Eugene said "sometimes forgotten" it's facts.
Mcgriddle is a solid 6 or 5. Shits good bros.
We need a Culver’s eat the menu
McGriddles are 1000% better if you sub round egg for the folded nasty egg
The filet-o-fish is definitely not better than the McGriddle. Get it together Eugene… 👀
there is another club burger on the market..from big boy. in fact it came before the big mac!
16:17 for Doodle Bob
I would love them doing Starbucks drinks together like this!!!!
I was halfway through this video and I was trying to fight off the urge to get some McDonalds, but I caved in... And I severely regret it. In all honesty though, I think maccas in Australia sucks :(  I also spilt my large coke in the car, all of it. I think this was a sign...
Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich   Not Crispy
please let this be the start of a new crossover series XD
I love Eugene, but he's out of his goddamn mind about the McGriddle.  It's the best breakfast sandwich by far (especially since they got rid of the steak, egg, and cheese bagel, which USED to be the best breakfast sandwich).  But despite that obvious misstep, this was a great video and I'd love to see more of this.
Hi, I'm Sharon Dipitious, this is my daughter Sara N. Dipitious. 😆😆😆😆
More rank the menu!
loving the yellowjackets references omfg!!! such a great show (also justice for the mcgriddle 😩)
mcdonalds in the us looks so ….. sad  i didn’t realise how much better the quality and range of mcd in india is until i saw this video
love this crossover episode
I'm with Eugene on the anti ranch boat  Also I think it's called a double quarter pounder cus it's 2 quarter pound patties
The top ten is sooooo close to what I would choose.  I have rarely had McDonalds in the past two decades, but I think I would go hashbrowns, mcmuffin, nuggets, fries, quarter pounder w/cheese, sundae, fillet o'fish, baconeggandcheese biscuit, spicy crispy chicken, hotcakes.  I have no use for any other items on the menu.    Hotcakes get big nostalgia points for me because I loved splitting the Big Breakfast with my dad as a kid!
I don’t think I would ever eat McDonalds lunch/dinner ever again aside from maybe the fries, but I would eat McDonalds breakfast ANY day. The best is The Sausage Egg McMuffin meal. (with a hash brown, or crunchie as my kids call it them, and of course a coffee. SOOO friggen good. I am 100% going to Uber eats that as soon as the kids leave for school in the morning. lol.
Title should be "Eugene talks about cum for 35 minutes"
As a Texan, I can corroborate the Ranch comment because I can go through 2 of extra large Hidden Valleys from Sam’s Club a month basically by myself 😂
Could Eugene do a video with his parents or any Korean American try staff in Korean🥺, I feel like it’s such a rare sight seeing Eugene speaking Korean. The Hana dul set segment was so kwute (*≧∀≦*)
When you find out Keith is a rocky top boy 💯🤙👌
Yay, Eugene, Hotcakes! Is what I know them as.
YELLOWJACKETSSSS
No one:  Me: Now I want McDonald's
I want anything with Keith!!!!
Eat the secret menu!
MORE RANK THE MENUS PLEASE THIS WAS GREAT
Another rank the menu please!!! 😁
Do this video but with Baskin Robbins
Actually, fun and TRUE fact the arches are actually made/designed to resemble boobs like a mother’s chest quite literally
Depending on the time you bought this the machine might’ve been cleaning and that made these in advance and stuck me in the freezer cause that’s what we do at night/during the morning when the machine is cleaning which takes a few hours
McDouble only has 1 slice of cheese s while the double cheese has 2
It’s a real egg. Like we crack that shit in either an egg cooker or straight in the grill
I have Bacon, Egg and Cheese McGriddle every Friday for breakfast! It's good!!!!!
Fun fact. The we have the quarter pounder because when a 1/3 pounder was marketed Americans thought it was less meat...... so Eugene is 1000% correct on the name of the double quarter pounder.
Look, I’m not gonna *fight* about the McGriddle, but I *will* say that it is the only fast food breakfast option I will consume, so I’m a bit partial towards it lmao
The energy was so chaotic.. Keith and Eugene are now my favourite try guys pairing!!!
Soft serve ice cream is the best thing ever, in my country we do have Macdonalds but I never ate their soft serve, however there is this other fast food chain that was just in the supermarket across the street and they had this place where they only sold ice cream, and having their soft serve with manjar sauce and M&Ms was the best thing ever, I just love it so much  I actually want to go there but idk if the mini store is still in my supermarket, I know the doggis is but not if the ice cream doggis remains there
Idk if it's cause I'm stoned but Eugene just saying gibberish for the names has me dying laughing. Great content bois
i was today’s years old that i learned the nuggets were suppose to be certain shapes?
now i want McDonalds!!
Justice for the McChicken. It’s the best item on the menu.
This was legit fantastic
This was amazing. More rank the menu please!
I love the combo! 😂❤️
Keith, PLEASE do Wawa on Eat the Menu! <3
came for the rankings and fun, stayed for the catholic church slander
What Keith did to Whataburger, Eugene did to the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle
Our ABS pump a little extra carbonation into the soda so it's extra fizzy when you get it and it takes a little longer to go flat  Since it's not caned or bottled
The vid is doing great sorry but you gotta do it again
I like the chicken mcgriddle or bacon mcgriddle
It's my boyfriend and I's nine year anniversary. We LOVE the Try Guys and would love to see you rank the menu at Panda Express (or whatever you would like to eat. love u)
I haaattteeeeeeee the Big Mac sauce with a passion
I honestly prefer the bacon egg and cheese McGriddle instead of sausage. I think that might have pushed it closer to the top.
They 100% spiked their sodas... This is not food-coma goofiness LOL
Please eat the DQ menu Keith. I beg you
I really appreciate you guys. As a person who struggles with eating habits sometimes, you help me eat easier :D
If you ever visit Sweden you have to try our fastfood chain Max
I want justice for the hotcakes, can't believe you guys ranked them last lmao
The ranking of the McGriddle compared to the other breakfast sandwiches was a CRIME.
Yoooo! It seems like American Mc Donald’s have the “old eggs”.. if you ever been to a Canadian Mcdonalds in the last couple years they TOTALY re did their eggs .. they got the “freshly cracked” eggs now- and their really delicious and taste legit. It seems America never switched their eggs?
There is sub/dom nsfw fanart just WAITING to happen in "I'm right. You're wrong. Open wide." Don't let me down, friends! 😌
mcgriddle is top tier😤
6:15  Did, did they just play Säkliärven Polka?    (Also, I am not Finnish, I just listened to the song.)
Eww 26:14 why does the ice cream look like it has a baby's face in it (on the top right side)
eugene literally just couldn't even fuckin english at the end
those soggy, bland fries that only exist to deliver salt being above the crispy delicious hashbrowns is a crime.  Mcdonalds fries are some of the worst fast food fries, and im certain they are only ranked so high because of that bizarre title of "world famous"  however the McNuggets are exactly where they belong!
It’s interesting to see the different things on the American menu.
A "bock" if you will.. 😂🤣
I loved this video and I need more of it. Please do this kind of video again.
10:53 The extra element missing is a layer of french fries shoved in there.
When will the Try Guys do a guest appearance as judges on a Food Network show? Beat Bobby Flay appearance/collab???
More "Eat the Menu"!! And yes, the McGriddle is gross.
The steady ascent to food drunkenness is so, so good
The Big Mac is an imitation of the original Big Boy so there is another one on the market and the Big Boy is really better.
Okay which one of us taught Keith the term “bevragino”
6:15 säkkijärven polkka??
“It’s good and you hate a lot of this” - amazing haha.
Y’all forgot the chicken biscuit!
beef flavoring on the fries, thats what makes them so good
Not the mcchicken slander!
Probably should’ve added syrup to the hot cakes plus chicken combo instead of ranch
The taco had me rollin 🤣🤣
mcgriddle disrespect. we can never  be friends. its on sight
McGriddler here advocating for the McGriddle being higher in the ranking! lol It's my favourite breakfast item at McD's (besides the hash brown hahaha).
Let’s compare the chicken sandwiches to the real king…Chick Fil A not Popeyes
There was a girl that went to my high school that was named Crystal Shanda Lier
I absolutely love the energy they have together. Please do another rank the menu
What if they just kept all of the extra food in the oven at a low temp. Then it won't be cold by the time they eat it xD
"If my arm was made out of apple pies" killed me
I love videos with Keith and Eugene! Theyre always so funny together
they should try canadian McD's because its so different to american McDs :O
At this point...please tell me McDonald's is compensating you!!!! 😂😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌🙌
Sausage McMuffin was left out
i love this format oh my god
This is my favorite duo hands down
I didn’t know what word they were censoring until Eugene started talking about the trees that smell like it😂😂
Yes please! Please please please do another rank the menu with the two of you!! This was hilarious to watch and pretty accurate in my opinion. Although my granddaughter would be very sad if she saw this; her favorite fast food breakfast is McDonald’s Mcgriddle sandwich! 🤣😂🤣
16:18 wtf did I just hear?
I cannot believe they ranked the McGriddle so low. 😂
17:31 patty mayonaise? Who is that?
Wait no more McDouble?
Wow, I actually agree with Eugene for once, lol. Same top 4, but #5 for me is the Junior Chicken, which I guess you don't have in the US?
Keith and Eugene making me realize why I can never finish my McDonald's Breakfast 😭
No way McDonald's nuggets are that good. They taste like fried, breaded sponges.
Y’all forgot the deluxe crispy chicken and the deluxe spicy crispy chicken, so glad I quit McDonald’s lmao
unofficially sponsored by showtimes "YellowJackets" 🤣
This is the funniest thing I have ever seen.
Please do another rank the menu !!
Nothing is more spot on Keith than "When I'm drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken" 29:35
Excuse me, hotcakes are the best thing in the menu ugh
ITS A FUCKING H ASHBROWN... U JUST SHAOE IT. GOD DAMN IT
U guys fell off big time.... reused ideas constantly.  Go ask buzzfeed for ideas boiiis or go work at target.
Big Macs are not big anymore. They need to rename them to Tiny Macs.
Coming from someone who works at McDonald’s the ice cream machine is not broken it just needs like five minutes to get cold again after putting cream in it
The McGriddle here in Canada uses a round egg these days (like they use on the McMuffins); so much better. Best hangover food.
You guys need to try Kelly Oxford's Filet o fish order. Get one with no tartar sauce, no cheese, add light mayo, add shredded lettuce. Makes it so much better!
Was it Burger King that came up with a third-pound burger to compete with the McD's quarter-pound but people didn't buy it because they thought 1/3 was smaller than 1/4?
The most hilarious thing is that I had nonstop Burger King ads throughout the video
Eugene is grossing me out with his topic of nutt
this makes me want mcdonalds but keith and eugene are much better than that shitty company lol
If only they ordered the 1/4 pounder deluxe. Comes with mayo, lettuce, & tomato
It's the ice...the Mc d'S ICE
Keith look like the dad that be grilling the food at the cook out on point
eugene’s a little weird with asking people if they’re hitting on him. like it’s a bit egocentric
Best thing is a $1 cheeseburger, and add the big Mac sauce for 14¢.
Eugene saying nonsense words when they introduced each item, should not have made me laugh as much as it did.
JUSTICE FOR THE MCGRIDDLE
Before you guys so harshly judge the McChicken, please try it with cheese dipped in ranch. Trust me I have gotten so many people hooked
I just now realized that US McDonald's food looks disgusting compared to other countries...everything is so smushed and bland looking
I'm literally eating McDonalds breakfast while watching this!
Please do more of these!!
“and that is how you know you’re a successful product…you can double the cost and have the same profit.” ummm keith??
Look... i have to say, our McDonald's food in Brazil kicks USA's in te butt! U should taste it if you come to Brazil
Tell me why I got a Burger King ad during this video LOL
In the Philippines we dont have Apple Pie instead we have *Peach Mango Pie* and we still have it fried rather than baked.
You guys have to try the Australian mcdonalds menu
Hotcakes in Australia must be significantly better! They slap so hard
The nuggets are bell, ball, boot, and BONE. Not bowtie. At least not in Canada. This is strangely important to me haha.
They didn't try any of the wraps or cookies or the dipped ice cream
I would have said you've never been wrong until you put McNuggets ahead of Fries. Rank all the menus
Eugene needs to try the mcspicy from Singapore he would dIE (from happiness)
honestly i love seeing keith and eugene together specifically, theyre just chaos embodied in a friendship
This was super fun
I love how Eugene is pronunciating everything wrong on purpose when they are announcing what they are about to try lol
I love when these two collaborate! Such a perfect duo
All I’m saying is, add pickles to your McChicken, it’s a game changer
Me low key shook Eugene hating my favey McGridde.
Keith's comedic genius needs no Eugene.
Bring the SnackWrap back !!!!!
I love the pillow to clothes color
I’m sorry, but the McGriddle is F*** delicious
Mcgriddle should be above mcchicken!
I'm also not a fan of ranch. I prefer bleu cheese.
Justice for the mcgriddle.
MCgriddler here specifically to ask some questions and possibly some riddles.
28:09 lol of all the times they introduced the food items, this one is the best.
love how they just start talking about the pope all of a sudden
As a Canadian I’m so confused by those nuggy sauces…
why is the breakfast burrito not on this!
keith and eugene really over here looking like Ketchup and Mustard while ranking Mcdonalds
I absolutely LOVE their pancakes! I'm appalled they put that at the bottom 😆
Is it me or..  I can't remember the last time Keith and Eugene were in a video alone together???   This was terriff!
They are high af
Orea mcflurry with matcha
6:30 I can't be the only one thinking of a ginko tree
Shout out to my injera homies
It was good to see Eugene. I also like the shade thrown at the Pope, McDonald's, and the food itself.
Keith + Eugene = 🔥
when i worked at mcdonalds you got a full slice of cheese on the fish, there was zero chance i was gonna take the time and fuss to split a slice of cheese in half
You could of done Eueith. Then it would sound like "you eat"
Not sure if anyone else ever did this, but my sis and I used to get a filet-o-fish no sauce, stack a layer of fries, and pour over their sweet and sour sauce.
I think Keith is someone that make people feel really comfortable. I feel like Eugene is much more authentic when they are paired together
Eugene takes small nibbles for the taste test and Keith eats half of everything 😂
the biscuits where the bomb, then mcdicks removes them off the Canadian menu, I stopped going there after that.
Something beautiful happens when Keith and Eugene and let free
MORE RANK THE MENU
Im offended they didn't do chicken selects
Buger King against McDonald
This is a collaboration that we need more of!
Y'all are all missing out on the best breakfast item: The Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Burrito.  Best freaking breakfast item there is
my AP Comp teacher told us that one time she got a McChicken on a road trip and bit into a CYST with a hunk of BONE in it and i stg i haven’t had mcdonald’s meat since
Keith should pull a “Supersize Me” and try one of those “eating nothing but fast food for [insert amount of time]”
As someone who worked at McDonald’s this was hilarious to watch
Potatoes also have natural nicotine in them so that could be a part of the reason that their hash browns and fries are so sought after
eugene reveals his fluency in simlish
I would love to see Keith come to Tulsa, OK and try Braum's. Burgers, ice cream, crinkle fries... <3
#1 - the Hotcakes are amazing! But only for the first 10 minutes after you order them.. if you are not eating inside or in the car...it deserves to be the worst. #2 - the Historic McDonalds in Downey, CA (Los Angeles County) STILL sells the Fried Apple Pie which is an EXPERIENCE!
I tried a Big Mac for the first time because of you guys. I'd rather stick with my Double Quarter Pounder. Also, the nuggets were bland. The fries, yes. #1. They were hot & fresh!
Mc nuggets is first and I am happy.
Omg yayyyyy Eugene and Keith!!!
That hot cake/nugget combo needed syrup instead of ranch!
Apple pies and old school fries....ahhh  the day when they were fried in beef fat...wow!
I've been waiting for this 🙌  love Eugene's and Keith's collaboration on this. Hope to see more ❤️
Definitely agree with the first spot! The one thing I absolutely crave from McDonald's is the chicken nuggets!
As a Sara Ann I feel indicted.
me: laying here high as hell, about to enjoy a filet o fish with EXtra tartar sauce, shredded lettuce AND pickles. life is good
I love Keith he’s so funny and such a big Gemini ❤️‍🔥
not me being uncertain the whole time if SHOWTIME / Yellow Jackets sponsored this episode because eugene kept referencing it😂
i feel like a proud mum seeing them both get on so well on this episode
‘When I’m drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken.’ 😂😂 keith’s face was so serious!
Keugene is definitely better than euth
This was just Eugene ranking and Keith eating and I loved every second of it
this is the best fuckibg video i’ve every watched
I missed these!
I'm just gonna say that c** comes (ha) in a variety of flavors, much like McNugget sauce. We cannot categorize it as a certain taste.
Not beef lol but apparently they use some kind of beef broth or something that makes the fries not vegan friendly. My sister can't eat them anymore lol
this *needs* to do well
The sausage mcgriddle is my favorite item...
Eugene takes such small bites, you can tell he is not a fast food eater and watches his calorie intake.  Keith on the other hand is taking big bites and is eating most of his sandwich.  😂
What does Eugene say when they both get ready to say “hot cakes”?
the canadian mcchicken is so good compared to the junior mcchicken!
My go to breakfast items are the breakfast burritos, egg mcmuffin, bacon egg and cheese biscuit with milk, if they have any bagel sandwiches those ate above everything and sausage biscuit with mustard.  The lunch items, I'll get a couple of McCracken add cheese and tomato and a medium fry. I used to get the double quarter pounder made like a big Mac but that too much meat for me anymore. They do the quarter pounders now with lettuce and tomato but it's basic. I miss the big n tasty and the wraps they used to have. The snack wraps were bomb too.   Not a fan of the nuggets. Or other items so much. I also miss the salads they used to have and the parfaits. It's like mcdonalds became super boring and basic. I liked when they had more items to choose from.
I love how Keith get more and more food drunk as the show progresses...
McDonalds is THE WORST! I'm outta here.
You can only get the fried apple pies at the oldest McDonald’s still open in Downey, CA
Justice for the McGriddle. That is the peak of fast food and I love how gross it is. I’m with Keith.
Oh my God...how can they like the hash browns...?  I think they're way too greasy and have a chemical taste to them.  If I ever have an egg sandwich there, I never make it a meal because I despise those hash browns.
the hotcakes have to be eaten the right way tho - smother it w butter n syrup and mmm
I need more of thissss
the fact this was filmed on my birthday makes me so happy
Two faced...
Fun fact: McDonald's has their coke syrup in metal containers to keep the flavor better and they have more bubbles, thus being a better taste with their larger straws. Love McDonalds Coke. My guilty pleasure
when eugene did his weird laugh toward the end the autogenerated captions put it as (evil laugh)
God bless them for doing another crossover episode 💯
I’m sorry but Eugene knowing what Ingeria bread feels like,,, made me SO happy
Keith always seems drunk towards the end of eat the menu...funny to see this happen with Eugene too lol
"Rank the Menu" is my fav cross-over
Bacon Quarter-pounder add Mac Sauce (lettuce  and tomato to make it Deluxe)
I love this duo so much!
Do it again!!
"That's how you know you have a great product.  You can double the price and have the same profits".. this... wouldn't actually be the best business model :P
Now.  I really want nuggets from McDonald’s now :(
More rank the menu please
i am soooooooo happy that they are watching yellowjackets!!! ned is taissa and zach is shauna then!!!
rank of the sauces duh.
I love seeing you guys in videos! Also, big macs are gross.
"Could it be beef?" Eugene sounded like kristen wiig in that one snl sketch
Keith and Eugene = Kate and Tully
Loved this rank the menu with Keith!
I really didn’t appreciate the slam on Catholics (probably shouldn’t slam a religion while also promoting equality throughout everything) but still a good video
I found the rankings horrific, but that's how opinions go. Was fun to watch the banter.
yeah keith is right, the mcgriddle is literally the only thing I go to mcdonalds for! Hash browns, spicy chicken sandwich, mcgriddle and mcflurry are the besttttt menu items
Rank all the fast food!!!!
Mcgriddle is the best breakfast thing ever at McDonald's hands down.
When the drinks came out, my immediate question was "was the ice cream machine working?' I am sure that it was broken just like the designer coffee machine.
Eugene,it’s good to see you so sweet and animated and not so dark..I enjoyed the banter guys.. :)
This is really fun for me because not being American, I swear these results would be different if they had our McDonalds. The hotcakes are perfect.
How could you fuck up the nugget taco so badly, good God? Why do ranch when you could have done syrup?????? I'm crying 😭
moar rank the menu
You know when you spend a lot of time around a single person and you start adapting their habits? That's Eugene this episode. First, when he pronounced a word like Becky and then the grease laugh was totally a Ned laugh.
My most ordered Items from McDonalds are: French Fries, Big breakfast w/Hotcakes, Steak bagel, Bic Mac, Sweet Tea, Strawberry shake, caramel sundae, chicken nuggets, McChickwn (with tomato and lettuce added), Chocolate chip cookies, and McDouble.  Former menu items I miss are the: Arch Deluxe, Big'n'Tasty, and the McSkillet Burrito w/steak. One on my fondest memories of going to China was seeing those Golden Arches as we arrived, LOL. People ask, "What's the first place you visited, the first time you went to China?"  My response, "McDonalds."
McGriddles??? JUSTICE FOR HOT CAKES! And F the Hashbrowns!
So call me the luckiest person on earth but I’ve never been denied an McDonald’s ice cream. Like a year ago, I ordered a seasonal McFlurry but they could only give me an Oreo one
Love this duo!
Justice for the McGriddle!!!!
justice for the hotcakes smh
Omg watching them get drunk off fast food...
o7 s in the comments for keith
I hope they do more of these
the fact keith kept bringing up yankee candle for the mcgriddle and i work there— yes. it is a yankee candle.
I’m a registered dietitian lol and I love all the eat the menu/ranking videos 😂
I loved this. But I love it even more because they were like "never doing this again... unless it does really well."
booo baked apple pies are great.
for a long time i didn’t even know there was a chicken sandwich on the dollar menu bc i would only order hot & spicys
They also have the Australian McDonald's Eat the Menu
I agree with the rankings 💯!!
Last few times I've had McDonald's it sucked
After having worked at McDonald’s for a year, the chicken McGriddle is so much better fresh, it’s stupidly good when fresh. The crispy chicken McGriddle (which I made up, you can’t buy) is even better still.
I LOVE the mcgriddle so that hurt but I’m wrong you’re right so I’ll shut up
I live on Canada and on our McGriddle we have the same egg as the McMuffin on it...not the scrambled style. I personally think it would make a big difference...just saying.
I want to see another rank the menu. But I agree with the rankings.
the original mcchicken DEFINITELY got worse over time, it's not just you keith
This segment would be better if you guys took it way too seriously. Think pretentious wine tasting.
Not Kieth calling out my husband first dinner date was dollar menu
I’d love if for Valentine’s Day Keith and Eugene ranked date ideas and actually went on the dates
This needs to be a series!
Yellowjacket’s is sooo good!
They didn't have the Big Breakfast!! or Big Breakfast with hotcakes. Pancakes with sausage and hashbrowns makes all the difference, plus the weird scrambled eggs. Is the breakfast burrito a regional thing?
Try Guys McDonalds (Taylor’s Version)
Sorry Keith McGriddles are so damn nasty
McGriddlers 💀
they used that same sound effect at 8:27 to introduce the high segment in jack and the box so my rat brain told me they must be high in this video also when it played
i'm so glad keith loves the mcgriddle
PLEASE more Rank the Menu!!!
OMG I LOVE KEITH AND EUGENE TOGETHER
THIS CROSSOVER
1. Fries  2.McFlurry (cookies and cream, HTH likes hard ass M&Ms in a McfFurry??)  3. Nugs   Carrie: Keith Samantha: Eugene   Charlotte: Ned  Miranda: Zack   I'm right, you're wrong, shut up.
The best burger is double big tasty bacon ❤️ the best dessert is the mcflurry ocomaltine extra chocolate sauce
McGriddle bread with chicken is the best. It's like chicken and waffles.
NO MCGRIDDLE SLANDER
Honestly McDonald's French fries on my rank of fries is so low like after eating fries from nados nothing can compare unless it's five guys
It feels like they got food drunk way faster than Keith normally does alone. Nice to see Eugene being silly in this vid :)
Y’all need to be making menu hacks at the end of every Eat the Menu. Just sayin
More Keugene aka the TryBoos 💙🏆🏆
There's worms inside the burger of McDonald's
ohhhhhmyyyygodddd these two are hilarious!!! the c*m jokes killed me 😂😂
you better make more of these because I've just experienced a level of happiness like never before
If you ask, you can get Big Mac sauce to dip your nuggets in (costs extra here in Australia). It's pretty tasty if you eat like a child (like I do) and have nuggs and chips as your go-to Maccas order.  I like the hot cakes, but you have to douse them in butter and syrup. Or maybe they just taste good because I almost exclusively get them after a fasting blood test, so they've got that nostalgia factor for me.
Wow, I didn’t realise Maccas packaging in America was still so much plastic! The Australian stuff has all become recyclable - including stuff like the hot cakes tray situation. And we have bamboo cutlery…
DID I HEAR EUGENE COUNTING DOWN IN KOREAN ON 11:39 ???
no hot&spicy chicken 😭
They said they’re never doing this again, but this was FANTASTIC! I need to see more!
ok am I crazy but is the big mac sauce so....plain? like when people say "big mac sauce is so good" i cant recall what it tastes like. heck the ketchup relish onion thing on a normal cheeseburger has more flavor than big mac sauce for me. ive given the big mac like 5 tries at LEAST in my 21 years of existence and not once did i enjoy the flavor of the sauce enough to remember it. IIRC it just tastes mildly garlicky. but it also just tastes too plain. like the burger lacks tartness and umami which the ketchup or the relish or wtv the red shit on a regular cheeseburger provides.
they quit frying them way before Michelle Obama's healthy initiative lol
Can Eugene do these with Keith all the timeeee!!! This was great!
Love these two together. They’re amazing. I love Eugene and everything he stands for, but I WILL. NOT let the McGriddle slander😡😡😡😂
one time when i was 11 i had 2 big macs and proceeded to vomit. i havent had one since. im 25.
NOT THE HOT CAKES SLANDER! I AM A MCDONALDS AFICIONADO GIMME THAT MENU ILL RANK IT CORRECTLY SPOILER ALERT HOT CAKES IS #1
Watching Keith get visibly nauseous at the end was really funny
I know taste is subjective….. but I just thought we were all in agreement that the McGriddle is one of the best culinary masterpieces of all time
Eugene just mumbling while Keith says the food name 🤣 10/10
Rest in power to the crispy chicken snack wrap.
Also, on the crispy chicken, y'all should try it with the sesame seed bun instead(thank me later)
Eugenes laugh at 29:54 had me in tears 😂
I literally go for nuggets, McGriddles and double quarter pounders lol t
eird how it's ok to make fun of catholics but make fun of any other religion and people freak out
This brought me true joy. Thank you
I would gladly be ruled by Eugene as him being the middle child king
"track and field...track" LOL yeah maybe the sports metaphors aren't for you Eugene 🤣🤣🤣
I thought the intro was an ad💃
sometimes my mama brings me mcdonalds hot cakes and hashbrowns for breakfast as a surprise
they need the hot and spicy mcchicken to be in all mcdonalds.
Eugene… I hate ranch too
Can these two do a mac'n'cheese Rank King please? KFC, Popeye's, El Pollo Loco (my fav!), Chick-fil-a, Panera, Boston Market, Cheese Cake Factory... just yes please XD
Not Keith saying "Thats what happens when a clown runs your business." That comment Has wiped me tf out. Keith 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eugenes laugh is so cute in this video lol
There’s an original McDonald’s in Downey California
You need to put the salsa on the McMuffins to be really good !
I don't get why the food looks so squashed? Do the same thing in europe, the standard in austria is incredibly better. Thx for the content, it really lifted my mood up (:
rank the menu Jollibee next ✨
I want to know the bleeped out word in the beginning
Fun fact:you can get a cup of mac sauce on the side to dip your fries in! Or add it to the Double Quarter pounder!
More rank the menu, much better than  eat the menu
Pls do this again I need this in my life more
How do nuggets beat a big mac??
But where’s the chocolate chip cookies?!
Put ketchup on the McGriddle. Trust me.
The best thing and the worst thing are my two favorite things at McDonald’s lmaaooo
I work at McDonalds
There needs to be another one, please and thank you xo
I want y’all to watch SATC and each dress up as one of the characters ppppppllleeeeaaassseeee!
Yeah more Rank the Menu!!
Should've added secret menu hacks to see how they stand up to the OG items!
In Norway they removed the spoon for the McFlurry. So now its not really a mcflurry cause they cant do that thing with the spoon. So its more like a sunday with toppings.
When I was a young warthogggggg! 😂😂😂
👋
Can’t believe that Mcriddle Slander smh.
The difference in bite size is so funny to me
more rank the menu! thanks!
Add pickles to the Filet o Fish. It's my go to
Keith is Miranda. Zach is Carrie, look at his wardrobe
Do this with taco bell
I am seriously questioning what kind of injera Eugene has had in his life
The Senate of Belgium passed Resolution 7-162 on June 12, 2020. The resolution condemns the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s state-sanctioned organ harvesting from living prisoners of conscience, especially Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs.  The resolution was sponsored by 10 senators and introduced on May 12. It was discussed in the Senate on June 8 and passed on June 12. Several senators spoke on behalf of their respective political parties and condemned the CCP’s live organ harvesting.  “I often see Falun Gong practitioners holding activities on Luxembourg Square [in front of the European Parliament],” Senator Mark Demesmaeker said. “They specifically call for an end to the terrifying and appalling criminal acts of organ harvesting from live Falun Gong practitioners.”  He said that China, under the autocracy of the CCP, has a strictly closed political system. This repressive system targets religious and minority groups, such as Falun Gong, as well as Christians and ethnic minorities. These groups have been turned into a live organ donor bank under this totalitarian political system.  Demesmaeker also said that forced organ harvesting is a crime and these illegal acts must be punished by the criminal law passed on May 22, 2019, “Van Peel,” which prohibits Belgians from accepting illegal organ transplants in foreign countries.  Senator Gaëtan Van Goidsenhoven, the representative of the resolution proposal, said, “[We] have reason to worry about a large number of organ transplants, and the organs mainly come from Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs.  “Whether it is from the general number of executions [by the CCP] or the total number of special transplants, we doubt the authenticity of the organ transplant figures published by the CCP. Our resolution is to expose and continue to help stop these illegal and inhumane practices,” Goidsenhoven said.  Senator Karin Brouwers said, “I thank Senator Van Goidsenhoven for the initiative to condemn this inhumane practice. This practice violates all possible human rights treaties. But this practice has existed for a long time. In China, it mainly happens to Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs. This must be stopped.”  Senator Hélène Ryckmans said that based on the available evidence, the CCP’s official statements claiming that all transplanted organs were taken from death-row prisoners are not credible.  “The actual organ transplant volume is unbelievably high,” she said, “If China has nothing to hide, it should be investigated by an independent international mediator and regularly reported in detail.”  Senator Fatima Ahallouch noted, “In 2019, the CCP regime sentenced at least 774 Falun Gong practitioners. The persecution of the Uighur community has been happening for a while.” She said that in 2006, the Belgian Transplantation Association (BTS) noticed that China’s Transplant Assistance Center website became active on the Internet with the purpose of promoting rapid organ availability in China.  The China Tribunal pointed out that the extremely short waiting times for transplantation in Chinese hospitals suggests that the CCP obtains organs illegally. Formerly imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs have testified that they were repeatedly forced to undergo medical examinations while in prison.  The senators who co-sponsored Resolution 7-162 were Gaëtan Van Goidsenhoven, Georges-Louis Bouchez, Jean Paul, Sabine Laruelle, Véronique Durenne, Philippe Dodrimont, Alexander Miesen, Willem-Frederik Schiltz, Bert Anciaux and Karin Brouwers.     The Belgian senate resolution condemning the CCP’s live organ harvesting
I normally don't watch the Keith Watson everything videos because I hate seeing Keith hurting himself but I couldn't resist Eugene.
Still desperately want you to try the German McDonald's menu. I know it's unrealistic, but it would be so awesome.
They need to make it a series!!
Favorite unique moments - Eugene knowing and saying "injera bread", and jonathan knowing the exact tree.  Also mcgriddle is polarizing for sure.
Should have gotten the double quarter pounder with cheese as a deluxe. It adds what it's missing.
im a middle child and I HIGHLY relate to "Emotionally problematic, but very important"
Where's the sausage egg Mcmuffin with cheese ! It's literally the number 2!
“No but I have a needle in my bag” “Mmm…not the same thing” I died 😂🤣💀
I'm convinced Keith is bi-curious, and you CAN'T CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE!!!!!!!!
Eugene, hens have a cloaca! It means sewer in Latin. Yummy.
Oh my gosh you don't have donuts and cookies from McDonalds in the USA ??
Double cheese burger add mac sauce and a large fry and a sweet tea was, and will ALWAYS be, my go too McDonald's meal. I also stan McGriddles sooo.
this was dope!
Please so many more Rank the Menus
It's funny watching this as a McEmployee... 😅
More....
6:30 I'm glad Eugene brought this up. There's a tree here in the south that smells like straight CUM buckets during spring time. It's nauseating.
I love ranch but McDonald’s changed the ranch and I just didn’t care for it amynkre
The spicy mcchicken was the best ! But they changed it now
The Mcmuffin only came with Canadian bacon forever. I can't say when it became available with sausage but initially it was always Canadian bacon for a long time.
12:35 we need a rank king chicken sandwich episode
Hell yeah more of this
*seacheese*, what vegans are fighting against
Lol this was great do another lol
I watched this while eating so we could eat together but then they started talking about blank trees 😭
Not so fun fact: the Bradford Pear is known for smelling like sperm or rotting fish🥴👍
I'm with eugene, I literally hate ranch lmao.
Rank the menu from that dumpling place in LA that Keith already ate. Monster Dumpling?
I fight for chicken mcgriddle rep
Eugene should do eat the menu’s because my girl friend can’t watch Keith (she thinks he is gross like the way he eats so calm down Keith) !
Please do more of these! You two were awesome. As always I believe Eugene was right in the ranking. Even thogh I do not eat meat personally, I think that the chicken nuggets are one of the best things to get. Kids love them. The fries are always a go to. Loved this. Thank you both so much.
I swear they are so naturally funny. They slipped into that “serendipitous” bit in .5 seconds and had me crying laughing so effortlessly
The Big Boy is a 3 bun burger that's been around since before the Big Mac.
I knew they were going to call out the Bradford pear as the c*m trees
There's something horrifying about the phrase "sea cheese" and I don't know why.
This is like getting the Pink and the Red Starburst in your 2 pack 🙌
This was awesome. I do wish they did the sausage burrito I think it’s the best thing on the menu
eugene seems so happy in this and it makes me happy to see
Eugene has terrible taste. I'm convinced
i love how they both exactly match the pillows
Same Eugene I hate ranch now!!
I've seen every Eat the Menu, and Kieth's giants bites get me every time 😂
I can guess from context but what word do we think is bleeped out?  We have Bradford pears in my town and they are a problem!!
love how this just ended up being a long ad for yellowjackets
I've never felt so validated for my McDonald's preferences before 🤣 I agreed with every single one. Except the McGriddle. That should be...  at the bottom lmao
This was great you guys definitely have to do another collab!
Favorite line from this video “when I’m drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken”
The filet o' fish is perfect with pickles added 👌🏽
I go to McDonalds maybe two or three times a year (road trip staple) but every time it's a two cheeseburger meal, remove the plain bottom buns and put the other halves together. Way better ratio of toppings lol. It's like science
Love the chemistry. These crossovers are what we crave.
i rlly hope they do these collabs every couple episodes of their individual shows !! i loved this
“Eugene lee yang famous internet Catholic” BYE😭😭😭😭
I’m glad you guys agree that the pancakes taste terrible
In high school I knew a girl named Seren.....and her license plate said DIPITY. ;)
Anyone else outside the US think it’s weird that their chicken sandwiches come in bags???
ok i'm sorry but did they really need to get two of each item?
wait till keith finds out mcdonalds sells bone in fried chicken in the philippines
When McDonald’s says their ice cream machine is broken, they actually just didn’t clean the machine the night before.
Deeply amused that my go-to from Mcdonalds (mcnuggets and fries) got the top ranks. Yeah McNuggets!
Kei-ge is so cute!
Can we just get a seperate audio track of whatever Eugene was saying during the intro of each item?
Best combo of shows ever. This should be a regular. Its so good.
Yeah! Fuck it! I went over to the kitchen and made ribs :¬)
I am beyond shocked that Eugene is wrong about something. Because the McNuggets are one of the most disgusting things I have ever consumed.
I was the same Keith! A McDouble and McChicken was my go to broke college year lunch combo.
Me who buys plain mcchickens all the time 😫☝🏻
this is the perfect video. love the energy.
Is Eugene high in this? lol
I worked at mcds for 3 years and from what I know of the menu (different area different items)...yeah except I don't like the nuggets personally but honestly popularity wise this makes sense...also do y'all need a heat lamp? I feel like eating these foods with at least some sort of warmth would be a better experience lol
As a kid I loved nuggets, as a teen my choice was the "McNifica"...
MORE EAT THE RANK KING pls. This was unhinged brilliance.
We don't have half of these options here in Sri Lankan but the ones we have definitely look more appetising 😂
Apple pies are still fried in Hawaii and they’re glorious! Lol
I want this again forever  And when they run out of Us chains they should travel abroad
PLEASEEEE RANK THE MENU MORE !!!!
Little ceasars add on a McDonald’s video
Yes do it again!!! I love seeing Eugene just being silly and this was such a joy to watch!
Well this internet Catholic loves Filet O Fish and McGriddles 😂
DO A CROSSOVER WITH TACO BELL MUAHAHAHAHAH
“When I’m drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken” me too Keith, me too 😂😂
so idk if y’all will see this but did you know that the big scrambled egg is premade and the white egg (aka round egg) if made fresh to order! you can substitute for that egg on your breakfast orders!
Am I delirious or do I hear the Säkkijärven polkka playing at 6:14?
McDonald’s coke is like no other coke on the planet
Oh yes. The smell of those Bradford pears piss me off. 😶‍🌫️🤢
you should do eat the menu for frozen food brands! like all flavors of stouffers dinners or lean cuisines!
HE DID NOT PUT THE MCCHICKEN ABOVE THE CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH HE DID NOT!!!!!!!! I don't care *where* these two are on the ranking, they just can't put the McChicken above the Crispy Chicken Sandwich! IT CAN NOT HAPPEN! I need to calm down
I have not laughed this hard at a Try Guys video in a minute! Love this. Hilarious!
I'm going to request that more of these be done. Do BK next to rival the McDonalds!
for me I can handle if my nuggets are a little sucky but if my fries are even slightly stale fries im so pissed off 😄
McDonald's chicken nuggets are disgusting 💕
Keith & Eugene paid by MacDonalds to promote their shit.
I really like this new Video Collar. Please more of that
these reviews pretty biased, bet those sandwiches been sitting for a few hours.  you order thru a drive thru and eat it, it's pretty good
McGriddles is HUGEEE in Singapore. We love it so much, we have stickers for it
To improve the filet o’fish, add pickles.   Game. Changed.
Bell, ball, boot, & bone.
The chicken has a cloaca not butt Eugene
I love it! Want to see more!
I just realized only North Americans can enjoy pancakes and maple syrup, the rest of the world is missing out
I want justice for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and the Hashbrown. They should be higher on the list. The has brown easily beats the fries, specially since the recipe change. The chicken sandwich should be in the top 5!
Okay- I’m from Canada and we do not have any of this strange, yellow, scrambled bs. The McGriddle is SO much better with good eggs. I am very sorry for your loss.
OMG the size of those McFlurry's!! im so jelly  In the UK the LARGE is half the size of that!
You did the Australian McDonald's though post-Buzzfeed... also do you not have caramel and strawberry sundaes there?
I wish you could try McDonalds in my country…my favourite burger is with the spicy tomato sauce, double spicy McDeluxe and prosperity burger(sold during New Year’s only).They have chicken porridge for breakfast,different flavour of McFlurry, different flavour of pie,drinks etc. I wish they would sell 5x spicy chicken again cause I miss burning my ass the next morning in the toilet (they’re really good tho)🤣
Keugene supremacy
A dollar and 8 cents gosh must be nice where I’m from I have to spend close to $2 on just one  now.🥺
Lolol I got a BK ad
i have watched most of your videos, but the sausage mcgriddle rank/take is the worst take i have seen... I'm so disappointed
Please do it again.
Omg you two have such good chemistry, you should collab more, like maybe start a group channel
I'm so sad they stopped doing all day breakfast. Nothing hit as well as a mcgriddle or biscuit at 2am
I had an art teacher named Dimitriatis so like it’s not impossible.
Eugene: Has an eloquent intro to the video Eugene later: Literal Sims speak XD
i live about 10 mins from the first ever McDonald's and that's my only flex
Eugene seems nicer in this video
Well now I just want Eugene and Keith to watch and react to “Food Wars!”
Has Eugene ranked Girl Scout cookies?
this was the perfect crossover and now I want a mcflurry
Eugene proves his gay privilege in this episode lol if a woman was on this try guys video talking about what cum tasted and smelled like as much as he did in the episode I guarantee they wouldn’t get the same love as Eugene
Eugene is being psychic about middle child hahaha 😂
Geez wish our hash brown one dollar they 2.70 in nz
As a heterosexual female that has come in contact with cum on many occasions… I couldn’t tell you what it smells like lol Eugene must study the smell lol
In 100% agreement on the nuggets taking 1st 🥇
More of these
They should've called the nuggets & hotcakes the McStake
It was basically an unwritten rule when I worked at mcdonalds to not get hotcakes on break. They sit in your stomach like cement.
I get the Canadian bacon thing but it's only called that in the states we call it back bacon and very few people eat it.
Oh hey grant o brian is doing a try guys video
their breakfast is garbage wendys ss
been thinking of this for a long time, what if Rank King do all the eat the menu and rank them?... and then....  YAY!!!  :D
What Americans call "Canadian" bacon is actually more popular in the UK. Peameal bacon is the real "Canadian" style bacon.
Where were the chicken McNuggets?!
filet o fish was actually made for muslims cause its the only halal thing they can eat all year.
Where's Jamie?!
Please do more of these! Keith and Eugene together are the best!!!
Chicken nuggets are the worst thing McDonald’s has 😂😂
As someone who worked at McDonald’s for 2 years from 2009-2011 the only breakfast egg I would eat is the poached eggs from the McMuffins. The rest are already pre made and you reheat them on the griddle. The poached egg is an actual egg you crack in the store and break the yolk
Wtf was that noise eugene did at 16:18 lol
This is a great duo. They really complement each other. The catholic part was so funny
So there is another burger out there that’s like the Big Mac. You guys need to get Frisch’s Big Boy. But has tarter sauce
Anyone remember those chicken tenders they had for a couple of years, I miss those things Edited to add:  the double quarter pounder is my go to item when I’m drunk or hungover
the "Could be beef" SNL reference meant the world to me
please please please do more rank the menu, you guys are my favorite combo and I love this video so much
Love this combo! More please!
These are so cheap :O here in NZ a small cheeseburger is like $4+ on its own.
try these things cook to order way better
JUSTICE 4 HOTCAKES
Y’all need to order a birthday cake from McDonalds.
I love this vid!  Would love it a lot more if the sound mixing didn't make it sound like they were shouting over the music :( I hope you guys can take a look at this problem soon, this is the last in a series of several vids where the sound/music alone has nearly made me turn it off, and I love the Try Guys.
I genuinely loved this episode so much.
Is it bad I want them to do one of these but also drunk?
i absolutely love Keith and Eugene together. they are my favorite duo!
could you rank red lobster
Can we just give a shoutout to the mastermind behind the alternating red and yellow shirts and pillows. It was so visually satisfying.
Where was the chocolate shake?? I absolutely love the chocolate shakes!
The pancakes are frozen and they microwave them! Nasty!!!
I honestly loved this. Keith had more fun sharing with someone. And their relationship is hilarious.
As a middle child I accept Eugene as the king of us
Sea cheese
I adore Eugene, like follow all his work, but never seen him so wrong. The nuggets!?! They don't even taste like real chicken!
Watching this video eating a chicken McNugget  meal.....delish
McDonald’s had offered the “little Mac” for a limited time and IT WAS MY FAVE. For others like me who think having 2 patties and 3 buns is overwhelming but love the veggies and sesame bun - it was the Big Mac but in half 🥲 BRING IT BACK!!!
nope, chicken nuggets suck...
Do whataburger again with Eugene!
When my 7 yr old tried the McGriddle for the first time he said it blew his mind! So now every time we go to McDonald’s for breakfast he asks for the sandwich that blows his mind! I also love them.
Eugene, The difference between the eggs: The round egg is called a round egg, the flat one is came a folded egg. Neither is microwaved, they are both cooked on the flat top grill in different shaped molds. The folded egg is weird because it is a scrambled rectangle, then folded over twice to make the square. The cooked eggs are held in a timed warming cabinet until they are used to make sandwiches, if the timer runs out, anything left in the cabinet has to be tossed. Fresh cooked never microwaved.
Excellent content good sirs
I put forth that, love it or hate it, the McChicken is the most honest of the fast food chicken sandwiches.  It's cheap and doesn't promise to be anything other than that. It shows that their 'premium' chicken sandwich is a con.
They needed to rank the McDonalds sprite and Hi-C Orange drinks because those are top tier! I appreciated the shoutout though to McDonalds beverages in general.
funny how filet o fish targeted Christians but in my country it became a Muslim thing
give us more rank the menu the people demand it
i love the mcgriddle
Has Eugene ranked the colors? If not, he totally should. I'm here for the rainbow, as well as both the two sets of primary colors. The "real" primary, and the "5th grade art class" primary.
A sausage mcgriddle no egg or cheese is ONLY thing eatable at MDs
I don’t know what it was about it but I LAUGHED OUT LOUD when Keith took out the piece of paper from his mouth after saying “what’s wrong with this onion?” During the quarter pounder with cheese test
Then Wendy’s , and then Popeyes
You should do KFC next
nah bruh you tweakin dem cakes be bussin
We need more of this amazingness MORE MOORE MOOOORE !!!!!!!!🤪🤪🤪💞💞💞💞
I bet that McNugget pancake sandwich would have tasted a lot better with syrup than ranch.
Muslims being called out by the entire filet o fish smack down… I feel you’re pain. We do actually go out for that shit haha!
Rank the menu is probably my new favourite show
Filet o fish , sub mac sauce for tartar  sauce.. You're welcome 🙃
Keith should have used honey on the best and worst combination at the end. Would have been close to a chicken mcgriddle
I love this collab. That and any video with Keith and/or Eugene. It'd be interesting to see these two do a full restaurant menu, like Nando's or a place that's got a shit ton of things on the menu. Keith should do Lota Burger. Their burgers are so good.
I'm surprised you guys ranked chicken nuggets as number one. I can't stand them 😂 for me, they would be the worst McDonald's item lol French fries would be 1 and apple pie would be 2 big mac 3
wrong it goes fry, mcmuffin, and everything else ties for last place
next time you get a sausage, egg, and cheese mcgriddle get it with tomato its life changing!!! 🥰
McDonalds had a really good crispy chicken sandwich and then a grilled option too years ago and then abandoned it for some reason. Every once in a while they try to bring back some other version and they're never any good
Okay I understand why the McGriddle got such a low ranking, but personally I think it would get a higher ranking if you take the egg off. I don’t like fast food eggs so I never eat it with eggs therefore I believe there needs to be justice for the McGriddle.
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLE
seacheese! 🤣
Chic Fil A?
It's the addictive hallucinogenic salt they use on the fries. Next time, try your fries dipped in the softserve !
I stop eating fast food for the most part but I’ll break the rules for an Egg McMuffin
I love hash browns but let’s be honest, they are kinda just shitty latkes
When I was a poor teen, I ordered a double cheeseburger, ADD MAC SAUCE (FREEEEEE).  Big Mac's for the poor.
two try guys are always better than one and this video is a proof of that fact.
Such an iconic chaotic duo!!
please do this again!
Didn't even get my favorite breakfast item - Sausage Mcmuffin with egg! Round egg, not that scrambled folded egg.
Are we pretending they arent high?
Try guys suck
This was awesome!! Pretty much agree, but I think the fries should be first and the nuggets second. McDonald's fries are awesome!! 🍟😋 Love seeing Keith and Eugene merging their shows!
I always love the slow decent into madness
My husband worked at mcdonald’s in hs and said the hotcakes smell AMAZING and taste like cardboard.
I am going to help make this...do really well....
Guys...DO NOT BLEEP ANYTHING EVER. Fuck anyone that cant handle the way you speak. I'm serious don't bleep shit.
I love this so much! I feel like I’m hanging out with my friends. And I haven’t laughed that hard in a while. Mr. Dipitous.
Okay but I think the hot fudge sunday is better than a mcflurry 😶 mcflurry is just to much sugar if you eat all of it... but the sunday and the fries are also the only things I get at Mcdonalds 🤣
Me losing all respect for Eugene after he said he doesn’t like ranch 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 LOL jk I love u Eugene
This is making me hungry for McDonald's
i love the keith and eugene content
this was my fav video compared to other new ones
6:30  ginkgo trees are known for smelling like rotting eggs and semen. I know this because my college campus is full of them.
Their content just continues to get better and bring so much joy.
theres no way the big mac goes that high have you even tasted the quarter pounder properly. those pickles, that vinegary ketchup, the onions come on
i loved this crossover so much😭😭😭😭
16:50 ranch was invented in Alaska lol
Kieth I care about your health but please keep eating the menu. I’ve probably seen each of them like 3 times now because almost everyday I eat lunch in my car and I put on one of the eat the menu videos and it’s literally my happy place and I look forward to work only because of that.
I loved this and I need a ✨RANK THE MENU SERIES✨
What is it about a cow and what comes from a cow ...  deep thoughts. hahahaha
McDonald's fries have real beef flavoring in them.
i love how the more Keith eats, the less his brain seems to function normally
I love cheese so much if sea cheese existed I'd probably eat it.
I wish they still had the Butterfinger McFlurry.
The McGriddle is my cult leader I would die for him, therefore I’m hurt
okay, but fries whit the oreo Mcflurry
Everything great, but I cannot understand why McDonalds fries are so highly rated. They are not good: All salt, barely any potato and often sitting under a heater for multiple hours. Give a Dutch/Belgian fry a try.  There is also such a big difference in quality. The USA version of the McChicken is 1 dollar, and you hated it. Over here it's 3.50 EUR and it's one of the better items.
*nOt BeEeeF*  I'm deceased😂
This is proof that The Try Guys really listen to their fans and what they ask for. Such a fun collab!
I'll probably agree that #1 should be the McNuggets, especially with the old school honey mustard from the '90s!  I also loved getting the toys from the Happy Meals when I was a kid (which were $1.99 then)!
Looooved this colab!
I worked at McD's for almost 4yrs. and I have never tasted Filet-o-fish snd McChicken. Nothing screams at me when I hear them. lol.
I remember being in band in the 8th grade and hearing the names Tiffany, Keith, Les, and Jared. Little did I know exactly how much of an effect 2 of those names would have on me. Alessandro has been a really awesome friend to me ever since I joined my high school's marching band. I never got to meet Keith IRL. But he directly influenced my decision to continue being in band in high school. Cut to my senior year and I and 3 of my senior band classmates and friends are also doing the exact same class that the 4 names I mentioned earlier are doing. Thank you Keith for making me see the ups and downs of high school marching band and the family we both have. I can't even begin to tell you how proud I am of all that you've accomplished. I know that all of SC is proud of you too!
OMG RANK THE MENU AT TACO BELL SO EUGENE CAN TELL KEITH HOW EVERYTHING IS THE SAME AND AWFUL (I love TB, I just know Eugene wouldn't)
cracking up each time Eugene just mumbles random words when they announce the next food 😂
Why do people call ham "canadian bacon" 😖 we have bacon (🥓), ham, and thennn we have back bacon and peameal bacon. No one in canada calls a ham slice "bacon"
I miss the days when Eugene hated doing this and Keith was the enthusiastic one lmao idk just something about it 🤣
I love McDonald's even though I've recovered
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION that nothing besides mcmuffin, fries, and hash browns are edible. You forgor
You guys should do zippy's eat the menu
We really need to import Keith back to Australia so he can eat everything at Oporto
This is so much fun, I love the Keith and Eugene dynamic and I feel like we haven't seen it in ages!
I love cold cheeseburgers from McDonald's. Don't get me wrong I don't purposely let it get cold, but like if I didn't finish it the night before, that shit slaps the next morning.
God it’s the middle of the night and now I want McDonald’s so bad😩 it’s like what did I expect but also damnit
Please EUGENE TRY JOLIBEE WITH KEITH NEXT 🤩🤩🤩
McGriddle sucks too sweet still.
The Mcgriddle is my son's favorite. But he takes it apart. He eats it as a pancake sausage and egg. He's 4. Dude, saves me money.  You would think he would want the big breakfast, but he hates that.  It's our Sunday treat since covid. We go eat inside because it's always empty. He thinks it's so special to sit down and eat it there.  It's the simple things in life for him lol. For me, the McChicken is my jam! But you gotta dip it in hot mustard.
Rank the menu for Panda Express! At any rate I'm a big McGriddle fan, but I hate the eggs so I get it without the eggs. Significantly better tasting IMO!
Please just more Keith and Eugene!!
Eugene-“ Ive never laughed like that in my life! I sounded like like a Batman villain!!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Way too many male bodily fluid references in this one, y'all. Most of us don't find that particularly appetizing in a food video. 🙄  Eugene clearly needs to get laid soon, lol.
32:16 Final ranking for future reference if anyone actually cares. 😂
Eat everything at Texas Roadhouse!!!!!! Plzzzzzz
Love you Keith. Love you Eugene. The McChicken is better than you gave it credit for. Y'all just keep being awesome. Did I mention I love you guys?
Hawaii’s apple pie is fried!
Try the McGangbang 😌
Keith saying the name of the item while Eugene babbles is just great
EUGEITH
I love that cc didn’t even bother with Eugene’s mumbling
I love McGriddles!!!
Yes. I do want justice for McGriddles.
jr chicken is the only thing i get from mcdonalds
Looking forward to the next time you guys do this. 😃
Who else is here for that amazing Keith + Eugene chemistry?! In the wise words of DJ Khaled… ANOTHER ONE!
i love how Eugene naming every menu item sounds like a sim
Can y’all do a reading/recreating fanfics part 2?
I still wanted to hear Keith’s best and least best!
I love these videos so much but I AM incredibly stressed out about them eating luke warm and cold McDonald’s 😫
This was hands down my favorite collab ever. Please do more of these!
was eugene just speaking simlish the whole time? LMAO
Eugene feels drunker in this episode than in the wine one
Fun fact in Hawaii some (or maybe all of them I’m not 100% sure) McDonald’s they still fry the pies. They also have a taro pie that is *chef’s kiss*
12:05 a McChicken in Canada is $6 🥲
The two of them should be rating the foods separately.
Life gets better when you realize you can order the double cheeseburger can be ordered with big mac sauce at no cost.
Rank all the seltzers 😁😁😁
Hot damn Eugene is so pretty.
Eugene Lee yang “famous internet catholic”
please more rank the menus i love eugene and keith together
McDonald's breakfast is the best, but they discontinued all day breakfast where I live.
I loved this collab. It was so much fun and Keith and Eugene have great chemistry, especially when they are both food drunk.
I'm loving just how perfectly their shirt colours match the set pillows!
The Filet O' Fish is the best thing on the menu. I could eat those all day long.
More eugene and keith, yes
Just wow the mcgriddlers
Always love Eugene’s energy with Keith 😂😂
Yesss please do another with Wendy’s!
The sausage egg and cheese mcgriddles are the BEST what!!?!
Please more Rank the Menu!!!
this video was great!! putting both your shows together was such a great and refreshing thing to see and i would love to see more of it <33 such a great duo
You can still get fried apple pie in Hawaii
2 x triple cheeseburgers with mac sauce and a hi-c orange is the order.
Eugene is clearly not considering the hangover cure potential of the McGriddle
I agree with Eugene.  Rach is the most disgusting thing in the world, idk why it was invented.  It does not taste good on anything and needs to be banished.  Thank you
yyyyaaaassss more rank king
You guys should do a rank the secret menu, like combos people get that aren’t just on the regular menu
Taco Bell collab!! Some even do breakfast!
perfect timing as it’s now my 3rd job>:))))
Me watching while eating McDonald’s Bc why not  LMAO
Ranking every cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory
we need more of these! loved this format
Keith and Eugene?? Just them? Answer from me... YES!!! yes yes yes. Yes please. 🙏💃
“except for this onion.”  *it’s paper.*  *it’s the outermost layer of the onion.*
Did he just say the Amber moon!???
Yes try more food stuff with Eugene hilarious he is !!!
please make more rank the menu!!
Eugene getting that grease voice right around the Big Mac.
I actually do want this to happen again. I loved this lol.
the fact that the sausage egg mcmuffin wasnt on this.. im offended lol
me living by Downey, seeing that McDonalds almost every day, seeing it in a try guys video: 👁👄👁
ahhhhh yes mix these sauces together to make even better sauce
Dipping the McNuggets in Big Mac sauce is the way to go!!
The sausage, egg, and cheese mcgriddle is my favorite of McD's breakfast items! The apple pie is only good when it's fresh baked and warm.
Keith being compared to Misty from Yellowjackets 💀💀
Mcgriddles are the best!
Wow the american mcflurry is about double the size of the aussie one
Do Subway!
Uhhhh why was there no breakfast burrito?!
I love this
Do it again!
Nicki Minaj isn't right about everything, but she was so right about ordering cheeseburgers with big mac sauce.
Where has Zach been lately?
mcgriddles are so good i won’t tolerate this slander
The reason mcdonalds fries are so different than other fast food fries is sugar and beef flavoring Edit: this also makes mcdonalds french fries not vegetarian friendly so yea sucks for us
How dare Eugene disrespect the McGriddle like that
So Keith is married to Becky, Eugene is with Matt, Keith and Eugene are sister husbands with sexual tension, Becky and Matt are partners with romantic tension. Perfect world
Watching again (procrastination rules) and I can't help but wonder how suddenly Eugene is taller than Keith.  Is it the chairs they're sitting in, or is it proportion? Now I have to further procrastinate by seeing them standing next to each other so I can notice if Keith has longer legs vs body length, or Eugene has a longer body length vs leg length.  I'm pretty sure I've lost my mind.
Probably one of my favorite Try Guys videos I've watched in awhile. Please, rank more menu's! (May I suggest Applebee's?)
we call the smelly trees pussy willows lol
I used to work at McDonald’s the half on cheese on the filet of fish I would also use the other half and wrap it around a nugget😂 it was so good but I always wondered too why only half cheese
Please do this again  Thanks
The Burger King chicken sandwiches are so good
Eugene talking and Keith gagging on the side 😂😂
What about the spicy chicken mcgriddle? And the bacon egg & cheese mcgriddle? I like Filet-O-Fish a couple of times a year.
✨”Is it the rejoining”✨  i died
What's cuter than Keith food drunk? Keith AND EUGENE food drunk. <3
testosterone
Rank ! The! Menus! All day. Please. How did the teeny tiny onions never come up? They are the only reason I ever go to McDonald’s.
You guys should try vegan fast food !!
You need to add the breakfast burrito,  the best item ever!!!
Keith should have put syrup on that McNugget Pancake taco at the end. Missed opportunity!
The funny thing is I just started dating a guy who's name is keith, is the same height as keith and has glasses like Keith xD but it's not the same Keith at all xD my Keith is 23 and wider than try guy Keith. But when I first met my bf Keith, I use to joke about him being in the try guys xD.
Keith is like cracked out this episode lmfao
Rank the best kind of pizza!
Living for this mash up!
🥰🥰🤣🤣😘😘🍔🍔🍦🍦
loved seeing Eugene on here, and would love to see you do Zaxby's next!!!
this video made me order a burger
what the baked apple pie is 19?!
Okay but try Culver’s (even like the custard flavors)
I love this crossover with Keith and Eugene. They’re always entertaining and passionately informed. The lack of the ultimate breakfast item Sausage McMuffin with Egg and McDonalds erasing all salads is HIGHLY SUS to me.
The bite size difference between them is very funny to me 😂
They haven't fried them in years. I worked there from 2012-2015 and we baked them then
It's not Canadian bacon, it's just ham!  (Trust me, I'm Canadian)
I love it when Eugene is in a silly goofy mood
Ok guys what’s really in those soft drinks lol!
I am so surprised by how half of these food look like. I did not try half of them in my life but those that I did.. wow...they look so different. tbh... if they looked like this, i don't think i would have ever returned to get food from McD. they just....look sad ....tired version. fellow Europeans... do they look the same in your country?
double quarter pounder with cheese made me throw up everywhere when i was a kid, too. still can't eat them (which honestly isn't a bad thing lol)
the way i eat mcchickens everyday ..
Hopefully Keith or someone form the team sees this. But… I don’t like MacDonals but then I moved to Europe and OMG! It’s sooooo much better here! Also the best thing ever is the apple pie (europe) OMG! Just saying… if they ever come to Europe, Keith needs to do eat all the menu in here
Fish sandwich is soooooo bomb! But it must be eaten right away they steam the buns for that sandwich
The fries are great but man they were so much better when they use to use beef yarrow to fry them in
The English muffins they toast them just right and the only sandwich they use a fried whole egg and not that fake scramble egg
We need more Keith and Eugene specific videos lol
This is my new favorite thing!! More of this please!!
background music was a bit too loud ;c
This was such a fun episode! More, more!
You should do dairy queen… RATE THE MENU PART 2
My favorites: 1. Fries 🍟  2. Cheeseburger  3. Chicken mcnuggets  4. Big Mac 5. Filet o Fish 6. Hash browns  7. Egg McMuffin
I don’t understand the hype over their nuggets, the thought of eating them makes me physically ill 🤮
No breakfast burrito? Would have topped the breakfast items
They are so funny together!   Also the censoring doesn’t get rid of the context clues lmao 💀
More Rank the Menu please!
I'm so down for this 34 minute ad for Yellowjackets!
the chicken nuggets are the best thing at McD's has, especially when hammered.
ngl i wish you did this in the mcdonald’s parking lot… cuz i’ve taken home fries before and they taste so bad once they cool down
Keith and Eugene need to get that invitation to the McDonald's HQ. I kind of want to see an Eat the Menu at their HQ restaurant...  I love getting Filet-O-Fish but I always get it with 2 fish patties and extra cheese and sauce  I did exactly what Keith did back in high school where you take a McChicken and McDouble and combine it into 1 sandwich. I forgot what it was called though
Rank king episode ft Keith where they rank the restaurants Keith has ate the menu of
Def want more rank the menu guys!!!! ❤️🥳🤤
“Where are you going?” 😂😂😂 oh I love these two together so much! ❤️
That’s why I love the fact that McDonald’s lobby’s are closed, so if we take the food home we can add the lettuce and tomato’s to the burgers at home
No offense to american McD lovers btu my god do i always get surprised how much worse they look like there, I would think they'd look the ebst where they came from...
I would love Rank the Menu to happen again!
Keith needs to do an eat the menu at Cracker Barrel
the first egg is made fresh everyday, the second egg is just a steamed egg that comes frozen
When I studied abroad in South Korea, my friends and I would walk home at like 4am and get McDonald's and I always got an apple pie, but when I came back to America and had one I was so disappointed and never ate it again. Sad 😔
All Chicken at Mc Donald's is trash regardless. I miss the Fried Apple Pies.
Well, I just binge watched Yellowjackets thanks to Eugene.
I’m with Keith on this one, McGriddles are 100% a dream come true. 😂😂 McGriddle stan defending!!!
I honestly I kind of forgot McDonald’s had any other breakfast than the pancakes because that’s all I eat growing up
26:10 has to be my favorite part 😂😂
BEST CROSSOVER EPISODE EVER
For once, absolutely agree with #1 and 2, because... I actually eat those - rounding out my top 5 would probably be filet-o-fish, specifically the BACON, egg & cheese mcgriddle, and the oreo OR M&M mcflurry - in a close fight-out with the usual cheap mcchicken sandwich. LOL
Is it just meor anybody else thinking while watching the video, 'Just whhy?'..(￣(ｴ)￣)ﾉ......ba ba ba ba ba
I REALLY liked this combination of shows, I'd love to see more :>
“U eat one u want another. U eat another u feel bad” if that didn’t explain the hash brown idk any other way to explain it lol
I’m here to support the hotcakes. They are a nostalgic part of childhood and paired with the butter and syrup, melt into a buttery sugary delectableness that comforts the soul.
i am yet again having one of the worst depression episodes in my life and this is making me cry happy tears. i love u guys so much, you have no idea how much joy you bring into people’s lives🤍
Yes they are doing it again 😊
you guys do realize you are eating human meat, right ?
I can’t breath from laughing
i love rank the menu
You have to do it again!!!
waiitttttt!!! y’all’s apple pies r baked ?? or is that an option you can get ??
I hollered "HEY!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡" then bust out laughing. Great Episode. (shaz=sharon)
I get the egg McMuffin (with no meat) extra cheese and then put the hashbrown patty on it. It's a favorite in our house.
I loved this!!
this was so fun to watch! definitely would watch more rank the menus
🌟Justice for McGriddles🌟 I love this chaotic crossover! The people want more.
Need this often!
I love it! Kuegene!!!!! 😍😍😍 Eugene’s best and worst is the literal opposite of mine
I think Eugene helped keep Keith going. He's normally down and just not into it come the halfway point of a normal Eat The Menu episode. Would definitely love to see another episode of Rank the Menu in the future.
How can someone's opinion be valid if they hate ranch and mcgriddles?
Keugene is fantastic together. I'd love more rank the menu.
I went to McDonald’s after this and got food poisoning lmfao
Eugene makes everyone more tolerable, love seeing Eugene!
I've always loved the Keith/Eugene Dynamic - they bring out the best in each other. There's no competition or shouty stuff, simply good thoughtful conversation and giggles.  And this is a genius cross over/collab. Love it! More please.  And really, it's just nice to see Eugene again, missed you!!! Hope that you are back now?
MAKE RANK THE MENU A SERIES *_PLEASE_*
Lol I love you Eugene ....we never agree with these kinds of videos how ever Finley our opinions line with the  stars 🌟 hahahah ...and yes more rank the menu you guys killed it ....Keith I love that you eat the menu so I don't have to hahaha
I am a McGriddle lover!!! I personally like the chicken mcgriddle better because it reminds me of chicken and waffles! way better than the sausage egg and cheese
This is legitimately one of the funnier videos y'all have released recently. I laughed so hard and enjoyed the combination of the two concepts. The Eugene and Keith combo definitely works with this idea!
yes more rank the menu😩😩😩
It's interesting to see some food items that aren't in the menu in my country.
I buy a plain hamburger for my small dog and just give her the meat. She love it!
we need more of this!! love the collab you two are hilarious together!
Rank the menu is genius!  We need more Keith and Eugene content!
The crossover I never knew I needed.  Seriously, we never see enough of Keith and Eugene together.
The baby bites Eugene takes is enraging. How do you TASTE anything?! I think Keith’s bites have ruined all other bites for me.
Yes, let's see another.
I ♥️ Keith and Becky aaaaaand also, I ♥️ Eugene and Matt.... and I want more of the 4 😁👏🏼♥️🏳️‍🌈✌🏾🤗🥳
maybe one day the try guy can try the items that are sold in Mcdonald of specific countries. for example, there no beef burgers in India, they have a vegetarian burger and one other 🌯
8 minutes in and I am slowly realising how McDonalds is apparently way more different across the globe than I thought. Literally, of all the breakfast items we only have 2 of the ones shown here (Germany), and a whole lot that are apparently not sold in the USA?? Where's the McToast? The scrambled egg plate? The frigging Bagels? The Croissant? Maybe they could do a Marathon Ranking of McDonald food of all countries one day X'D
Keith, for the love of god, chew with your mouth closed. lol
that mcgriddle rank has deeply offended me, and I will return with a riddle once I find an appropriate one
Y'all should do another one of these for the Taco Bell menu since that one is pretty old. I really enjoyed Keith having a buddy to slog through even the 20 or so menu items here! Keith and Eugene are so fun together. 💙💜
Literally just ordered mc donalds for lunch because of this laddmsdnf LMAO
idk why i came here i just got my wisdom teeth out and this is making me want to eat solid food 😭😭
I've never had a McChicken before because it's a local item lol. I bet it is bland.
I want “Eat the Menu” with a high Keith and a drunk Eugene.
Double Cheeseburger is the best small burger there. And Big N' Tasty is the best big burger, but, I guess, it's not served in the USA.
The old school McDonald’s in Downey still deep fried there apple pies 🤤
“Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet catholic” 😂😂😂😂😂
Definitely more Rank the Menu.
Can you do rank the menu jollibee
I grew up Vegetarian & i LOVE nuggets.. so yea they are the BEST !!
THE ONLY REASON YOU HATE THE MCGRIDDLE IS CUS YOU DIDNT EAT ALL THE PARTS SEPARATELY
I’m with Keith! Mc Griddle should be higher, I get a sausage mc griddle w/ the round egg and I put my hashbrown in the middle of it 🤤💯
Really triggered over the McGriddle placement
I have to sub for round egg on all my breakfast sandwiches because I don’t like The scrambled or folded the scrambled comes out of a carton and the folded comes in a bag only the round egg is a real egg that just gets cooked there
But why didn't Keith put syrup on the chicken pancake taco???? It's basically chicken and waffles
I can imagine it's hard but tasting everything in one go?! yea, I love that!! I love comparing tastes lol! But must be really hard to not over eat... like a huge buffe and yep, you stay full for days after those lol
This video had Eugene and earned 1.4M in only 2 days. This shows how we want him in the videos!!!!
This is a collaboration that I never knew I needed.
More of this mash up! Yeah!!!!
Y’all know apple pie is actually made with potato… it’s not actually apple.
YESSSS MCNUGGETS! i always order them every time i go to mcdonald's.
There isn't the mcfish in brazil right now
vid idea: -each make boxes of chocolates/candies the kind filled with different flavors for valentines day with your own choice of fillings and shapes -DIY valentine gifts for the pets
As soon as Eugene said "too much bread" I thought of Bret Krishna's hack. Go look it up and thank me later
the bleeeeeeps are so much fun, too 🤣🤣🤣
i love this collab! Eugene's naming of the items is crazy fun😂
I used to work at McDonald's and we never deep fried the apple pies
The only breakfast item I ever eat at McDonald’s is the McGriddle 😂
I will not abide mcgriddle slander
They got rid of the breakfast bagels in the UK last week and I am still OUTRAGED
Jeez I am Australian and the amount of plastic on American macca's food is ridiculous. Who wants hotcakes in plastic?? We have it in paper, our cutlery is all bamboo and all the straws are paper, hell they even made new lids for the fountain soft drinks so no straws are used at all. Watching this a culture shock, I had no idea packaging would be that different globally.
Keith is super out of touch with mcdonalds. Mcchicken is 2.70 not a dollar, the hashbrowns are 1.99 not $1.
Am I the only one who sees that their shirts match the opposing pillows?
Go back and watch tv shows from the 60s and 70s... matter fact, even the 80s and early 90s.  Pay attention to the way men used to speak then.  They spoke like MEN, they didn't talk like the girls in the movie CLUELESS.  Dudes in 2022 carry themselves with the tonality and mannerisms of teenage school girls.  It's fucking bizzare.   What happened, America?
Their shirts coordinate with the cushions 👌🏻😂
The factory makes a longer/ taller bun and cuts it into three Big Mac baby
I love how Keith subtlety called Eugene two-faced
Eugene’s teeny, dainty bites vs Keith just going in and inhaling 😂
I always felt like Eugene hate Keith idk why haha, but I'm happy to see they make videos together like this one
Just in case they didn’t know folded egg goes on McGriddles and biscuits. Scrambled eggs are liquid egg. The real eggs are the round egg and we actually crack them. They only go on McMuffins. Also McMuffins always come with cheese.
judging from the ;) tension, I feel like it's  best to leave this video on 69k likes...
The McGriddle is fantastic. Even better is the chicken McGriddle bc it’s like a chicken and waffles situation
Please do this again!
Which of the try guys is which person from sex and the city?
LOVE Keith and Eugene together! more please!! I laughed so, so much. Thank you!  :)
In the UK we still have the apple pie deep fried - it's tasty
Keugene supremacy
Love Keith and Eugene videos! ❤
I laughed the entire time. Eugene and Keith together is magic
Smh so nasty 🤢. This is when your low on content and just do whatever at this point.
I love how Keith takes big bites of everything and Eugene takes these small delicate bites 😂
i hope you try Indian Macdonalds>...
I’m not gonna lie this episode is one of the first in a while to make me ugly laugh. Like I usually giggle at the other videos. But this one had be losing my mind. I’m still laughing at that catholic conversation
Fav episode in like a year...hands down...so good
The fish sandwich is only good when you are in the mood for it I like the fish sandwich
Another video like this again. Please
When's the last time you had a baby burger? Baby burgers are super thin, there's hardly anything there. It's much smaller than the McDonalds dollar menu patties but costs more for less on the burger. I worked at A&W for years.
This needs to be a reoccurring series! It’s too good!
Love seing eugene❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did you two purposely dress as ketchup and mustard?
Why is nobody talking about the Hail Mary joke 😭😭 ffs favorite joke
OMG
Where’s the breakfast burrito????
This was really fun. At least for us the viewers. Would love to see more of rank the menu
How y’all gonna do breakfast and NOT do the sausage egg McMuffin? The best and most popular breakfast item!?
This was a great idea plz do it again 🥰
If you guys do this again, maybe something healthier? Panera? Lol
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLES! And wtf is apple pie baked in the US now? Asia still has them fried and good.
ok.
look how flushed they got after a few bites
It’s two days later and the video is STILL on trending! We getting another another collaboration lol 😂
22:16 took me ouuuttt💀🥴
GMM is getting kinda weird
As a mcgrittle Stan, I’m with Keith on this one 😭
Love these two together
Anyone else think it's weird how Eugene needs to bring sex into every show multiple times? Dude, we get it already. You don't need to be defined by your sexuality 100%.
Their dynamic reminds me of Uncle Joey and Uncle Jesse!
Not to be all Father Time but I just realized I’ve been watching these people for like 8 years now and am having a panic attack
The big Mac is not great, is has too much bread and not enough meat, but that sauce redeems it
As a McGriddler I agree that it is trash… but I can’t stop getting it lol
The BEST duo, honestly. The fans demand more of this haha
last time I was in Asia, they still served the OG fried apple pies 😍  though mind you that was almost 5 years ago (hong kong and Thailand )
I love this! Please do more Rank the Menu ❤️
McGriddles are my faaaave from the breakfast menu. I just don't enjoy the filmy texture is leaves in my mouth.
Hawaii still deep fries their apple pies!
The recurring *squeak* jokes were grade A humor.  Also was Eugene basically speaking Simlish instead of saying the names of most of the items?
Need more of this😂
Eugene thinks a McGriddle is gross but puts pig blood in a cupcake…
Did the McGriddle used to taste better originally or is it just my nostalgia?
Round egg(real egg.), Folded egg(carton), and scrabbled eggs.(carton.)
Love a good roast of the pope 😂
I never realized Keith's level of food drunk could be achieved by another. Congratulations Eugene 🎊 👏
fun fact, for all the breakfast sandwiches you can ask for the mcmuffin egg instead of the folded egg. they call it a round egg
As someone who love hotcakes more than anything else at McDonald’s, I feel sufficiently roasted 🤭
okay but eugeith??¿
Don't tell me y'all didn't sing "When I was a young warthog" at the same time
as a hot cake lover...i completely understand. #20 and proud
My fave is the fish filet!!!! And I don’t typically eat fish!  Lol
Mc Griddles are disgusting I would never order them or the hot cakes.
yellowjacketsss gang!!
I miss the steak, egg, and cheese bagel they had :/
The hotcake taco should be called the Ranchero Hot Cake Taco
Keith. wanna do an easy eat the menu do a Raising Canes eat the menu
Part of why the fries and hashbrowns at McDonald's taste different than anywhere else is they fry them in beef fat. It's why they're definitely not a vegetarian friendly restaurant.
The hot cakes are my favorite and Eugene is definitely wrong but also he's probably right because I'm sure I just like the fact that I'm basically eating cake for breakfast.
someone created an instagram account called "McSenget", honoring all the tilted mcdonald's burger, but mainly the fillet o fish.
Justice for the mcgriddle!!!
I can’t stand behind these ranking l’s THE MCCHICKEN AT 15?!?!? i can’t  GREAT VID THO 🤍
Eugene saying "I could pour water over your face while I jab you with a needle" was just epic...🤣🤣
Big Mac is so iconic and deserves #1 !!!!!!
I'm a little hurt by the drop in Filet O Fish, but I'll allow it
Disrespecting the Double QPC!
Okay, another Eugene and Keith crossover episode but they do the top 20 Cheesecake Factory foods! That way Keith doesn’t have to eat the whole menu!
This was amazing
AHHH THIS WAS THE BESTTTT SO FREAKING FUNNY
no way the new fresh beef quarter pounder isn't #1
Somehow they started this video already being delirious and just kept getting more delirious. I love Keith and Eugene's energy! More please!
Am I the only one that has never ordered nuggets from McDonald’s. Not even when I was a kid I use to order cheeseburger happy meals.
Does it not bother anyone else that Keith eats his sandwiches upside down???
squee glad to see Eugene back on the channel I love ALL the tryguys BUT ... He's my fav <3
The food names should have been said separately, could barely hear Eugene. Also would have been nice if the food name was written in both langues. But overally you're wrong about the pancakes... Just saying.
HOTCAKES ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DESERVE THIS S L A N D E R. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NOSTALGIA CRITERIA
Ketchup and mustard with ketchup and mustard pillows 😍😍😍
The Big N Tasty was better dammit!
did they wear red and yellow on purpose.....its the dedication
Do it again in a different order in few months and see how changes ... specifically breakfast later
These were the least based rankings ever 😭😭😭 how dare you
The chemistry between these two needs to be showcased in more videos!!! Cant wait
I would've switched the mcgriddle with the mcmuffins place
Eugene only ever seems to enjoy himself with Keith. They vibe on a different level. Love this collab and want more.
Just finished the video and I already need another rank the menu, best Try Guys video I have seen so far!
You can tell that Eugene's been watching a lot of SNL lately XD
They forgot the cinnamon rolls
This is the crossover I didn’t know I needed
McChicken add MacSauce cheese and tomato. The best order
Hear me out. The best is the double quarter pounder....BUT you only eat half at a time. Pull it apart so that each half is one bun and one patty. Then eat them separately.
keith is flyyying
All day breakfast for mcdonalds?? That's crazy they don't have that uk
Calling Buzzfeed,  “The Before Place” from now on
My favorite items are the best (chicken mcnuggets) and worst (hot cakes) 😅
My first job as a teenager was at McDonald's. That mcflurry spoon is like that because the top part attaches onto the machine that stirs in the topping.
Eugene saying, " We like to double murder things" in the cadence he did, made me laugh almost uncontrollably.
27:46 the gasp followed by patience tinged with disappointment
Definitely want more rank the menu. It's the perfect blend of gluttony and pride.
Would not recommend watching while having the munchies
more Eugene + Keith vids plz
rank the menuuuuuuuuuu  again plz
I need to see Eugene's take on encanto!!
This is such an amazing and chaotic combination
Do Jollibee next please
This made me crave some Maccas hotcakes (I know Eugene isn't a fan based on this video, but maybe the American hotcakes are worse than the Aussie hotcakes, who knows 🤷‍♀) and I was very distressed to discover that Maccas stopped doing all-day breakfast in Australia in October last year! This is an outrage!
Yesssss I would love to see another rank the menu
RANK MORE MENUS PLEASE 🥺
Omg I love how they watch shameless
Rank the menu is great!!!
That’s hilarious My order is big Mack combo with a side Of Nuggies
Keith is the Carrie Eugene is the Samantha Zach is the Miranda Ned is the Charlotte
I’m a mcgriddler and the McGriddle is the best thing McDonalds has to offer. The sweet, the savory. It’s a perfect breakfast.
I want to see pepperoni pizzas from multiple places and rank them haha xD
the guy on the right is a douch
More of this!! Loved it!
death upon shitting
I ones dared myself to eat 2 Big Macs in one sitting was bad idea. Plus ones my mom snuck for me McDonald smoothie in her purse to movies
Okay so having a spouse who was a manager at McDonald's one of the main reasons why the ice cream machine is "broken" is because the staff does not want to break it down and clean it, because it is a pain you have to take it all apart you have to clean each piece yeah their ice cream is fantastic but remember that next time
The McGriddle tastes like doing the walk of shame after disappointing sex
Injera Hot Cakes 😂
I liked this format, and watching Eugene get eat the menu delirious . Please do more together! The hot cakes are only good hot, try them tossed in the microwave for 10 seconds.
the mcgriddle is the best thing to ever be invented
My favorite pair, also Eugene saying other words when they presented the food lol
Sharron Dipitous is unironically the best drag name
The McFlurry spoon looks like that because it's a blender attachment to mix your toppings in.
I'm really into this Rank the Menu thing!!
I always get the sausage, egg, & cheese mcgriddles 🤭 but i ask to sub the flat egg for the round egg (the egg from the mcmuffin)
my mom used to work for mcdonalds in the higher up corporate stuff. when i asked her why tf the cokes were so good she said that they have a different syrup to water ratio and thats why them shits are so damn good.
I absolutely love Eugene!!
“Sea cheese”
Tip from a collage student who eats too many food with questionable origings, try taking a double shot of Jager after these, they might help you digest
chicken mcgriddle best item at mcdonalds
Keith's description of Mcgriddles as wet Styrofoam has been the most accurate description of one ever. The squeaky feel on your teeth as you bite it is atrocious but damn they're my favorite breakfast item from them.
Idk of it is nostalgia or I have weird taste buds, but the ranking of the hotcakes hurt my soul a little bit
If the snack wraps were still around I bet they would have ranked high
no hotcake slander allowed
Try guys try a escape room? That would be so cool 😃
Is Keith+Eugene my favorite Try Guy pairing?! This video makes a strong case! 😂😂😂
Delirious Keith is always the best, but together with delirious Eugene??? Spectacular
The 😤 bell 😤 the 😤 ball 😤 the 😤 boot 😤 the 😤 BONE 😤😤😤😤😤😤
Big Mac sauce is hypnotizing. 😂
You say that double quarter pounder needs lettuce and tomato, but they actually offer it and I got one and... never again. It made it disgusting, which I figure is just down to McDonalds using disgusting lettuce and tomato. So disappointed.
LOVED THIS
Those hotcakes are bussin. I'm highly disappointed
Most of these items are only good warm. After they sit something just goes wrong.
I love the McDonald’s color inspired outfits
I've never realized what a good duo Keith and Eugene are!
McGriddle stan
In the UK they still fry the apple pie and also the filet o fish has a full slice of cheese. It's really weird that they only give you half a slice over there. You guys should definitely do more rank the menu. The chaos is wonderful
I would adore another one of these, it was awesome
I love it when Keith eats everything, he starts fresh and his eyes are full of live.... at the end, he looks sluggish and his droopy eyes look like he wants to take a nap! The food coma is real!
As someone who was raised catholic, and went through 12 years of catholic schooling, I completely agree with everything Eugene said
THIS IS- I- the mash up we needed.
Keugene? Not Euth?
loving the yellow jackets references
more rank the menu's! the keith and eugene duo is unprecedented.
Nooooo......McDonald's pancakes are the best!!! 👌
Hello, I am a McGriddle Stan. Thank you.
I laughed so hard at this!!!!
McDonald's now only gives half a cheese slice on a Filet-O-Fish?! Sacrilegious! Blasphemy! Same with the Chicken Nuggets! The breading is more crumbs now... it used to be like tempura batter!
More rank the menu, please!!!
Is... Eugene drunk in this? He looks... happier? I think?
I can think of 3 90s shows that had an anorexia storyline: Sabrina, Boy Meets World, and Full House
I agree with Keith that biscuit and mcmuffin need to get behind the McGriddle but that’s just me.
SO many laugh out loud moments. Thank you for this joy.
Please do this again!!
I don’t like anything McDonald…
Did you know that the reason that McDonalds soda tastes like the syrup is more prevalent is because they get the sodas shipped in metal containors instead of plastic bags. The plastic contaminates the drinks and alters the tase whereas the metal doesn't do anything to the taste.
i always order mcnuggets and fries and i am happy to have been confirmed that that is the right choice. No milkshake or mcrib reviews, though!
The mgriddle is a whole breakfast in my fist and I wouldn't change anything about it
The crossover i was not expecting but greatly enjoyed and much want another
Eugene I agree, ranch kinda sucks 🤷‍♀️
I need more of this lol
I just watched Markipliers latest vid before this and here we are... What's with the Serendipitous today...
Fun fact: the ice cream machine (or whatever it that does the Mcflurry )can only be cleaned and maintenance by this one company. This company can not keep up with all the McDonalds and therefore it is always down.
“I’m not AGAINST Canada”
not y’all hating on mcchickens😭
Eugeith>> Keugene
I can tell you that the McDonald's canadian bacon is not actual Canadian Bacon. It is a ham shaped lie.
They should have put the sundae on the pancakes, I used to work at McDonald's and I'd get pancakes, chocolate syrup, whip cream, and a banana (brought it from home) put them together and it's a great dessert/ Breakfast
Keith can you do an eat the menu kosher restaurant
McDonalds always gets rid of the stuff I like. First the snack wrap. Now the breakfast bagel sandwich
Eugene is the most neurotically crazy and Keith is the most low-key crazy. It’s perfect.
Rare L ☹️
Best thing+worst thing= chicken mcgriddle
Ever since I was little the hotcakes have always been my favourite thing from McDonald’s aside from the grilled cheese that came in the happy meals, but I am not a good example because I don’t like pancakes in the first place. (I also don’t eat at McDonald’s, like basically ever)
I love Sex and the City, and I am so sad that Samantha is not in And Just Like That...
KEITH I GOT YOUR SAUCE AS A HOLIDAY GIFT AND THEY WERE AMAZING WE PRETTY MUCH DRANK THEM, THANK YOU.
I’ve watched this about 5 times.   I vote more Rank the Menus!
two weeks ago my wife said „eugene and keith should do a rankking/eat the menu crossover where they compare the signature burgers from all the fast food places“ so since she apparently manifested something there i feel like you should do that.
Who else wants the wraps back?
McGriddle got done dirty. Easily my favorite breakfast item at McDonald’s
YOURE IN THE TOP 50 TRENDING! GOOD JOB!
Rank The Menu: The most ambitious crossover of 2022
Why is nobody talking about the fact that the McChicken is ranked so low? Maybe it tastes better where I live, smh 😂😂😂
McGriddle with round egg (type in the McMuffin) is firreeeeee
I love Fillet o Fish but its only available during lent in my country :c
sea cheese lol
Can we get a rank the menu for Burger King or Taco bell
The coordination between pillows and shirts is a little much
There was ONE Chicken sandwich they missed and it is hands down better then the regular Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The DELUX Crispy Chicken sandwich. It gives you the sauce, it gives you lettuce and tomato.
Y'all should've tried the cookies, somehow McDonald's cookies are just 👌
Ranch sucks good job Eugene
As an Ethiopian, this is so exciting! You guys talk about Injera like it’s something everyone should know! My people have made it! lol
Petition to do rank the menu again🙂
I learned how much I hate everything on McDonald's menu with the advent of delivery services.  Zero care in packaging means having to put the burgers back together, and a 1-2 minute shelf life guarantees that everything tastes like cardboard. (dry cardboard at that)  Burger King and Wendy's survive food delivery far better.
Rank the menu- Cheese Cake Factory
#2 NEWS FLASH: to Kieth & Eugene. PLEASE READ #1 BELOW.
The McGriddles are my favorite
Keith and Eugene are so great together! their banter brings the eat the menu video to life :) Also McDonalds US is so different than in Canada!
thias someone whos worked in mcdonalds in multiple cities, I feel like eugene would've rated the filet way higher if he knew asians and elderly were the main demographic consumers
Wait, does the US not have the Chicken McGriddle? That’s my go to breakfast menu item from the Golden Arches. The chicken is seasoned really well (could say it has a bit of heat to it) and it’s seated within the perfect vessel; the McGriddle. Make it even better by putting a hash brown in the mix, and maybe an egg if you’re feeling it
You guys, I don't think should want to help McDonald's. There has been so many bad reports out about them. Last heard fingernails & bandaids had been found in their food. Then things just escalated. It was reported that ALL beef has been found to have human DNA in it. With this info it was commented that the cabal likes to include the public in their rituals. If this isn't bad enough... With President Trump going into different countries taking down the swamp & it's dasterdly creatures by following the tunnels they ended up in Karakistan.(close spelling) Horrible things are happening in the tunnels with babies & children. I can't say anymore than that bcuz it brings me to tears, literally makes me sick, breaks my heart & ruins my day. You can look this all up on the Internet & you might want to sit down when you read it. This country is loaded with satanic symbolism everywhere, it's capital is named satan, it's the home of the illuminati & I think it's basically a Satanic country. The Karakistan Mofia is from there & it's a satanic Mofia. The owners of McDonalds is a satanic crime family that lives in Karakistan. All satanists believe in child sacrificing & canibalism. Ronald McDonald wears red shoes. In satanism red shoes are symbolic but satanists actually wear them. They are made from the skins of babies.  Yes they sacrifice little helpless babies. All McDonald's will be closed for these reasons. All of this has been discovered from Pres. Trump taking down the Swamp & the Swamp Creatures. They did find human meat markets in the tunnels. At some point our Internet will go out supposedly for I think it is, about 10 days & at that time this info & much, much more will be released out & to the public. This is info I obtained from listening & watch the Digital Warriors on the Internet. This is real folks. While some of this many be incorrect I believe almost all of it is. So don't help McDonalds. Don't encourage people to go there. Talk about this with them. And DON'T take KID'S there! They gave the name of the meat company that actually sells human meat but I was so sickened I didn't write the name of the company down but I'm sure you could find it if you google it.I think their # one company is McD's but they disperse to MANY fast food companies. DON'T EAT at thes companies people. DON'T SUPPORT them AT ALL! SUPPORT instead! Pres. Trump. TURN RED. TURN AWAY from Biden who's a cabal crime family and actually owns one of these tunnels that goes to the Ucraine. Vote against him. The same with Pelosi and most of the Dems. Hillary, Bill, Kamala, Obama & wife, ect., ect. are the same. WAKE UP people! WAKE UP! Don't support McD's!!!
Nice to see Keith spending some quality time with his wife’s boyfriend. 😁
Absolutely agree with McNuggets being the best!!!
Mcdonalds fries have Beef Tallow in them thats why they taste way diffrent, but they are not veg which is lame. They also contain more than 10 ingredients. In the UK its illegal and they only contain Potato, Oil, and Salt
My poor McChicken 😢
Eugenes face in this one showed that he in fact knew he wasn’t right
justice for the mcchicken
🤌
THE MCGRIDDLE IS THE BEST THING ON THE MENU TF IS WRONG WITH Y’ALL
Also hash browns no 1 ftw!!!
Here to echo everyone else, give us more of this!!!
I love when these two get together, they seem to have so much fun!  Also i love filet of fish!!
Agree with Eugene about ranch, and chicken nugs, but NOT the McGriddle!
Eugene some how made this less gross?
One of my old classmates got in trouble for yelling the Hail Mary when I went to Catholic School.
I thought it was the bone
THEY DIDNT TRY THE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!!!!!!!!
McGriddles are good. They are a lot, though. I could eat like, half of one and then take a nap, while I could down 2 bacon, egg and cheese biscuits.
More classic "trying new things" videos with all 4 guys please. Honor the original concept once in a while, you know?
You forgot the steak mcgriddle :/
I unironically always orders the filet o fish bc it SLAPS, dip it in the sweet and sour sauce, change your life
Bradford Pear.. I know the smell
Rank Carrie's boyfriends 😄😄😄
Chick-fil-A over Popeyes any day for the chicken sandwich!!!!!
single burger will always have my heart
Where I work, the mcchicken and mcdouble are like $2
THATS NOT CANADIAN BACON!!!! Pemeal bacon, is Canadian bacon.
Do  like Costco or sams club
hi
U guys should do everything at subway plzz I want to see that video that would be everything also I love you guys 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Me and Eugene agree on the ranch. It’s literally gross to see people eat it lol
protip: order the sausage mcgriddle and two hash browns, put the sausage in the middle of the hashbrowns (hot sauce optional) and then you have a delish sammich and some griddle cakes for dessert!
Hashbrowns plus strawberry jam is the way to go.
I enjoyed this, more please!
Next episode... Tasting gourmet cheese 😂
Justice for the hotcakes 🥞
Eugene: “we’re never doing this again” Keith: “probably not” Eugene: “unless this does really well”  #6 on trending 11 hours after this video was posted
Euth would be cool if you say it like "youth"
MOORRREEEE
I'm so confused. I'm don't comment often and haven't been on social media in 3 years. Can someone please explain the purpose of copying other ppls comments as your own??? I've only noticed it on this vid cause other ppl pointed it out but wow, there are a lot !!!
Keith should have used honey with his chicken pancake taco.
Ok don’t hate me for this, but I’m specifically commenting cuz I loved this and you should 100% do it again 🤣 more eat the menu and rank king crossovers!!!
Theres no way eugene just put the mcgriddle below the biscuit and mcmuffin
Popeye's apple pie is better too, nowadays.
Loved the energy in this!!!
Keith and Eugene together are the perfect chaotic combo.
In India we get the brownie sundae instead of the fudge sundae and it is delicious 😋
Eugene needs a break
More Keugene!!
Wendy’s nugs are better and I will die on that hill 💁🏼‍♀️
i thought they would only eat like 5 items since its the most popular foods  also for me number one are the fries...
eugene naming the things has big aristotle on snl energy
eugene slipping in that SNL reference regarding "it might be beef" is top tier
19:28 myumyumyum :D
Petition for McDonald’s UK to have Hot Fudge Sundae in the menu. I fucking miss that cheap shit😭
McDonalds hot cakes are the only pancakes I like. Idk why but it is that way
McFlurry is a ripoff of the superior Dairy Queen Blizzard.  Ok bye.  Lol
Commenting to make sure this does really well so that they have to do it again.
Does anyone else dip their fries into buffalo sauce?? Cause yall missing out!
TRY MOD PIZZA NEXT!!!
"when im drunk i want to eat a rotisserie chicken" xD
wow, i actually agree with you guys based on your rankings!!
“But of that was the *before times* at the *before place* “😂😂😂😂
I always want to like these videos but I can never get through them because of Keith chewing with his mouth open D:
There are so many *squeak* trees here. So during the spring its soooo bad. Like a waft of *squeak* hits your nose.
This was fantastic, please do more episodes like this!
"They trick Becky with that for sure." Keith regarding the fraction psychology of double quarter versus half pound. Poor Becky. Hahaha
They definitely smoked before shooting this lol
We need more of this!
Where is the breakfast burrito?
my McDonald’s stopped serving breakfast all day so i never eat McDonald’s anymore lol i used to love the southwest chicken salad too, but they don’t have that on their menu anymore 😭
I really like Eugene and Keith together. I watch all the videos but normally I'm not a fan of their stand alone videos. This is the first rank king and eat the menu episode I really enjoyed 😄 lol sorry boys apparently we all like to see you suffer apparently 🤣
We need so many more rank the menu episodes. Also, thank you Eugene for dropping facts about ranch. It's never tasted good.
The McGriddle is so good!!! I agree with Keith it should’ve been higher!
KEugene is my favorite Try Guy pair up.
Mc Donald is bad its so small burger do nothing AND EXPENSIVE
I’d like to know what McDonalds is selling their hash browns for $1 cause in az one is almost $4 after tax 😭
McGriddle for life!!!!!
I would watch more of these. Just saying.
As a middle child I happily accept Eugene as our king 👸🏻
i love the crispy chicken sandwich but i have them add big mac sauce!
Keith is Guy Smiley. Same chaotic game host energy.
Where my McGriddle bois at?
When the squeaky toy sound byte played my poor puppy thought I was teasing her with a toy lol She is very pupset about the lack of toy
I find it very odd that I was watching the titanic ship sink animation and then stalked that channel and watched a couple other ships sink. I say okay… let’s move on from this topic and watch something a little more lighthearted. Then THE OPENING LINE is related to Titantic ?! ok.
Is it just me or is the background music really loud in this episode?
Do it again
swap fillet and mc griddle right now or god help me
As a fellow gay middle child Eugene is my role model. 💜✌
I feel like these rankings would be vastly different if they removed a bun slice from each sandwich (with the exception of the nuggies and fries - those would still be the top 2). Like, McGriddle is the only breakfast thing I get from there BUT trying to eat it with the full bun is too rich so I take one off. I do the same with some of their other sandwiches as well because the bun is generally the worst part.
The problem with the machine is every flipping store will only pay to have 1 maybe 2 employees, usually a manager, to go through the training course on how to clean and put the machine back together. They have to send them to another company (the manufacturer of the soft-serve machine) and so they can't just put it back in their pockets. Anything to save a dime.
Seeing Keith and Eugene in a video is crazy to me besides regular videos
Lolol "in the before times, in the before place". Thanks for making me smile Keith!
I can't believe you don't have a heat lamp to keep the food hot by this point y'all lol
I think the true winner is yellow jackets
McDonald's fries will always win over every other fast food restaurant.
Rank every menu. All of them.
MORE RANK THE MENU
I’m w him I’m not a fan of ranch at all I kinda don’t like it at all
Eugene said Sara Ann >   And my whole body got ice cold like sir pls
Keith.. I always get two hash browns. I happily eat the first. I happy start the second and then I finish it with sadness cause it always gives me a belly ache lol you were spot on.
To actually answer "what is it about McDonald's fries" There's allegedly a bit of corn syrup in the oil.
Okay but McChicken McGriddles are lit
My two favorite Try Guys in one video doing my two favorite segments. THE BEST!!
I used to eat sausage and egg mcgriddles with bacon added for breakfast regularly. Now I'm 30 and I can only do that with the McMuffin. I have similar metabolism as Keith.
I could live off your top 7.  Great ranking.  Yes moving the apple and cherry pies to baked vs. fried….awful move.  Nothing was better than that crunchy and bubbly deep fried pie.
The sausage McGriddle is perfection.    Anyone who says different is crazy.
I relate so much to the feeling  that McDonalds burgers are too bread-forward. I'll always resent the day that I ordered a cheeseburger Happy Meal and literally FORGOT TO ADD THE PATTY! I had a CHEESE SANDWICH.
I was thinking that Keith should redo the McDonald’s Eat the Menu, and then this popped up! And it’s even better because it’s a whole new thing! With Eugene!
As a mcgriddler im offended
The before times at the before place lol
I LOVE this video. My only complaint is how the McGriddle was treated 😭
More rank the menu!!!!
Such a perfect crossover. Since Eugene didn't get to join Keith for Popeye's I think that should be the next Rank The Menu!
When I want a snack I order the cheeseburger with big Mac sauce and extra pickles, onions. Yummy. Its just right to get it to be not so dry and not be starving waiting for dinner.
I want more of these.
The McGriddle has really gone down hill. It used to be my order but I don’t like it anymore
All Mc Donald's food is "rank".
Great, now I want McDonald’s!
We always need more Keugene. I'd love to see episodes involving popular Texas chains... especially to see how Texans feel about Whataburger being ranked after their response to the Whataburger ETM episode!
YouTube. Please don’t ever recommend me these beta boys.
You guys are in trouble because of course we all loved it!
That was really great. I do hope we get another Rank the Menu. That was amazing.
I used to work at mcds after high school for about 3 years, and sometimes we'd get to customize sandwiches for our employee meals. One time I had one of the guys on grill make me a big mac with quarter meat. Omg so good but way too much. Its def better with the skinny 10:1 patties lol
Me dying every time Eugene straight up doesn't even try to say the name of the foods, I legit laughed out loud every time.
Can the try guys try skateboarding
agree to disagree... McGriddle should've been higher
When my sister was a sophomore in high school, she had a teacher who she nicknamed "Mr. McChicken" because his real name was "MacCallan" or something similar. She liked him a lot more than you guys like the McChicken sandwich lol
I am very much an Apple pie Stan and I’m a little offended and disappointed
Oh y'all tripping the  bacon egg(circle) mcgriddles with 2 hash browns are the best!!
Fast food delirium is real.
The delirium of these two are what I love for 😅😅
I’ve legit been getting the fish filet sandwich from McDonald’s since I was a child - I Stan filet o fish. 👊
me, as a australian mcdonalds employee, cringed at the quality of american mcdonalds
I wish you guys had Hardee's out in California although it's basically the same as Carl's Jr I am told. Their chicken strips are so good. Their burgers are so much better. Their ice cream is real. Of the fast food I prefer them way over McDonald's and I absolutely cannot stand Burger King.
Okay hear me out, the chicken McGriddle with cheese, with habanero sauce. Life CHANGING
truly distraught over the mcgriddle rank
I like the apple pie, it would be in my top 5, part of my regular order! 🍎🥧
Eat the Menu brings us an air of wholesomeness and Keith struggles to eat everything, but perseveres for the greater good. Rank King provides a feeling of decidedness that straddles the line between comforting and a feeling of lost choice. Combined, the outcome is beautiful, and confused.  Keith eats so that we don’t have to. Eugene decides because we don’t get to. Together, they bring each other down from their respective pedestals; they bring each other down so that we don’t need to.
How does human flesh taste??
In Canada before the pandemic, the McGrilled had the egg from the Egg McMuffin. You could have with bacon or sausage. It was soooo good. We never had the scrambled egg.
Yeah i definitely want another rank the menu!!!!😁
Angus mushroom n swizz nearly killed me
My daughter really love Try Guys, and to think she's turning 25 but still laughing out loud out of these guys eating and ranking food, this is a good one.
the crossover i've always wanted
Omg ronald mcdonald was def inspired by pennywise😟
Dang it i thought u guys were gona pop out with the big n tasty, snack wraps n the country chicken sandwich with that one single solitary pickle 🤨🥵🥵
Yes!!! Loved this!
Since some of you are from Texas just, like me, how about doing Whataburger? If you did one, from Whataburger then I'm sorry. Btw, I love me some RANCH!!!
Craving McDonald’s
I hope this video does really well so we can have more
Thank you guys for properly assessing that you need a double cheeseburger if you aren't doing the big patties bc just one thin patty gets completely drowned out by the bread and cheese.
The way Keith bites into these fucking burgers omg I'm so hungry
Eugene should do more drag and his drag name should be Sarah Ann Dipitus. Or Sharon Dipitus!
the nuggets with honey <3
Highly recommend a McDouble with mac sauce, it's a really good combo
Eugene takes the nicest little baby bites and Keith gets half the sandwich in his first bite lolol
Yaaaas, I missed Rank King!
Oh man. I knew you were talking about Bradford pear trees before you even said it. My old college campus is covered in those things. Fck those trees.
Loving the SATC references lol
disclaimer: i would have known exactly what eugene was saying without the censor   that being said; is it intentional that i can still read yalls lips even with the censors? cause i'm fucking howling, i love it so much. if it was unintentional please don't change it in the future, if it was intentional, good job editors, i'm having the worst day and this detail made me laugh as much as eugene and keith and that's really something
Please welcome to the stage Sharon Dipitous!!!
California McDonald’s must do the chicken sando dirty because it is not dry on the east coast.
I never comment on things but I would actually LOVE another trampling video with Keith and Eugene
“We won’t do this again unless this video does really well” Everyone : like, comment, share immediately
Anyone else’s filet o fishes always have lettuce on them? Ohio McDonalds’s wyd?
The only time I ever had a mc griddle, it gave me explosive diarrhea at work
When Eugene said the McFlurry is something you’re seek when drunk is 100%… I’ve walked 5 miles drunk to get a McFlurry
@mcdonalds PLEASe give us a gluten free anything option
Keith should have put maple syrup on the best/worst combo. It could be a very poor man's Chicken and Waffle.
It took until the bull testicles reference for me to realize what word I were saying
I love these videos so much! Thanks for making this mash of Keith and Eugene! it’s amazing! ***audio note... the background music behind your voices can sometimes be a bit loud and makes it difficult to understand you sometimes for the hearing impaired- I use CC but it’s nice to be able to hear you too! Just a note:) thanks for making the best content out here!
Eat the menu with a competitive eater!
Only with cows can they say "we like to double murder them". If they talked about dogs, they would be cancelled. Hypocrites 😆
The comedy chemistry you both have is so enjoyable to watch.  Please do more of these if you're up for it again. Very good content x
I LOVE KEITH AND EUGENE TOGETHER! We need more videos like those
This is the platonic ideal of a great try guys video <3
Don't get me wrong, I love all the try guys but this duo right here...I LOVE THE MOST.
Imagine ranking heart disease for money
More of theeeeese!!!
This was excellent
I prefer the Bacon, Egg & Cheese McGriddle over the Sausage, Egg & Cheese McGriddle 😋
Omg i love you guys 🥰
I love how delirious they both got while eating the menu cus honestly McD does that
Oh wow. Scintillating, thought provoking content alert. This certainly advances us as a species.
Please do more of these! I loved watching the two of you banter 😁
why do woman skin nuggets?
when i worked at mcdonald’s a lady in the drive thru ordered a cheeseburger without cheese and then yelled at me when i rang in a hamburger because they aren’t the same thing. i told her i would make sure it was a cheeseburger no cheese but i had to ring it in as a hamburger. even got the kitchen to wrap it in the yellow wrapper. she still called to complain
Why the need to make horrible comments towards Catholics and their representative? You would never do this to other religions, why is it fine to mock Catholics?
For an April Fool's joke Keith should eat everything at Raising Cane's.
I love how Eugene keeps mumbling the names and Keith is saying them in earnest.
THE MCCHICKEN IS $1 AND HASHBROWNS ARE 2 FOR $1....WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK In Australia has browns are $2 and a McChicken is $6.80 Also, why is there a muffin, a bisket, a griddle then a burger and a sandwich. What is the difference
I somehow hate all the MacDonald breakfast items😅😊
watched it twice in two days. it's sooo good, i love them together! :) just what i need, feeling on the edge of getting sick, weak and grumpy.
hahahahaha i’m only 2 mins in but how high is eugene in this video
I think a better combo name is Eugith. I’m standing by it.
Um 1, I need more rank the menu. 2, JUSTICE FOR THE MCGRIDDLE!
i love how eugene starts a joke, can't continue because he's laughing too hard and then keith just takes it away for him
You asked if we want another Rank the Menu... And we do! Bring it on ❤️❤️❤️
Guys, help me out, whats the word that eugene said at 6:12? I am not native english speaker so i have no idea 😭😭
I love McGriddles and Hotcakes
Keith: Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Biscuit! Eugene: Mgfha hfsrbji kugffma
This is the blend of my two favourite things. Please more!
There is one burger missing, we have it in South-Africa, MC feast deluxe burger, the best of all MC Donald burgers
There’s always a lot of points where I think an eat the menu is just off the rails and done, but “prosthetic arm” was just so harsh. The music change, the look on their faces. There was no coming back then.
The sheer size difference between their bites is sending me xD
Eugene's face when he said "Famous Internet Catholic" needs to be the hot new reaction image
I got an ad for taco bell and idk how I feel about watching this video anymore...
You guys are nuts. The McChicken is _at least_ in the top 10, and definitely above the Egg McMuffin. An oversized Chicken McNugget with lettuce and mayo between two toasted, slightly sweet buns _for a buck_ 🐔. You can’t beat that (unless you’ve got a box of Chicken McNuggets).
Omg my parents almost named me Serendipity!   They cam to their senses.

you need to do this in Australia omg maccas is so different here hahaha
Rank the menu Taco Bell
You want to truly "double dip" on an animal? Eat the whole family with chicken ramen made with chicken broth, pieces of chicken and don't forget the soft boiled egg!
These dudes have never been funny
I like the mcgriddles but 1) altho I like sausage as a whole more, the bacon one is better and 2) it's also a lot better and not as wet if you eat it with the hashbrown on it as well. *chef kiss*
🥰Eugene🥰
I am so happy to see Eugene here. I dunno him just throwing his angle into it and mixing with Keiths system just made it so much more fun!!
Justice for McGriddles for REAL
This is such a creative way to maximize two of your best shows lol
“We won’t do this again unless this video does really well” Everyone : like, comment, share immediately
I loved this! It's so great to see Rank King, but I also love Keith and Eugene together. I love all the Try Guys, but Keith and Eugene just have such great chemistry together. It's so much fun watching them. Really enjoyed this. ❤️❤️
eugene and keith together provides a level of serotonin in my brain i never knew i needed 🤯
I LOVED Keith & Eugene together!!! ❤️💕 Me re please!
can we just take a moment to appreciate the set design and wardrobe choices? the yellow and red cushions on the red and yellow shirts *chefs kiss*
What about breakfast bagels with breakfast sauce? Is that not a thing nation wide?? That's all I get in the morning if I stop at mcdonalds.
I LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF THIS!!! Keith and Eugene together are amazing and hilarious! I would love to see more of eat everything on the menu and rank the menu
We need more Keugene videos 💜
I love all your food videos ❤️
Adding Big Mac sauce to a quarter pounder or double quarter pounder! *muah*!
King of middle children 👑
Sausage McMuffin w/egg is better than the Egg McMuffin (which has ham)
McGriddles are the best  breakfast at McDonalds. I like them either with no egg or half egg.
Keith is my favorite try guy - 50% of that is because he is a cat person lol  But I also relate to his humor the most
I just wanna know what Eugene says every time they introduce an item lol
this makes me think that american mcchicken is trash because the ukrainian one is really good to me….
Definitely more of these, I know you said probably never again but DEFINITELY MORE OF  THESE
More please!
I cant believe that here in Hawaii all our mcdonalds pies our fried. Y'all are missin out.
omg as an Ethiopian born and living in England, I cant tell you the absolute shock and joy of hearing Eugene compare his food to injera! It's so lovely and comforting hearing words from your culture which are never said or explored in media or by the vast majority of western people; most western people who've tried it would more likely refer to it as 'Ethiopian food/Ethiopian flat bread'. There isn't a single Ethiopian restaurant in the entire county of where i live here in the UK, so hearing this made me feel ssososososo happy. SOOOO much love!
Yall didnt get the Homestyle Burger! Loved this episode tho
Keith: I ate a double quarter pounder once and I threw up Me: *only gets a double quarter at mcdonalds*
I would love to see Eugene ranking fans submitted volunteered outfits
This was great! But fuck you the McGriddle is heaven sent LOVE YOU
Tried hardees menu
The McGriddle is the best breakfast item outside of the plain hashbrowns
Lmao my mom’s name is Sarah Anne but her last name is not dipedous lolllll
I love the keugene energy. And ranking the menu was a great idea! I’d love to see these two do this again for sure. I’m also team McGriddle lol. It’s the salty and sweet and soft and warm thing I want to eat in the morning lol.
the before times in the before place
More
Keith looks really good with that mustache.  I know that he's had it for a while but I didn't like it much at first.  I don't know what it is that made him look so good with it in this video.
Yes to more Rank the Menu!
This is the weirdest episode of Star Trek I have ever seen...
32:50 McNutcakes
No but I have a needle
This was such a treat, really hope you do another segment like this :)
Bk rank the menu
I will never forgive y’all for placing the McGriddle low
What about the sausage egg mcmuffin??
Commenting just in case you need more data to say “we should do this again”
The before place 🤣🤣😂
Don't know any kid names sara n dipidous. But at my work someone does have twin girls. Ordered a birthday cake for years for the girls. The girls are named Cinda and Rella. Literally how it is written. I kinda feel bad for those girls. They just turned 3. Have a tough life ahead. And I worried about naming my son Ronald. Lol
"Eugene Lee Yang the famous internet catholic!" 😂
that fact that Eugene keeps making Titanic references is very serendipitous bc I just went to the museum a few days ago
I’ve watched this a couple times. Gawd I love Keugene
I used to be able to eat a double quarter pounder with cheese meal until I saw "Super Size Me" and Morgan Splurlock barfed after eating the same meal. Now the idea of eating that burger makes me feel sick.
i thought eugene was gonna say “you know what i like about catholics… nothing” lmao
Why isn’t this called “How High Is Too High?”
NOOOOO I LOVE THE MCCHICKEN :( It’s what I get every time :(((
Even though everything tastes the same according to Keith, and they still haven’t given him a sponsorship I think ranking Taco Bell would be fun!
the hash browns are about $2 now
Blame Michelle!
Did Eugene and Keith purposely dress up like ketchup and mustard? They are the cutest duo
Really disappointed they didn't try the chicken biscuit, it's the best thing at McDonald's by far. Get it with some pickles on there omg
The shade thrown at their old company lol
Ugh. McDonalds baked apple pie tastes like disappointment compared to the original fried one which is better in pretty much every way.
So as a former mcdonalds employee, I love a double cheeseburger with Mac sauce and lettuce. It's like the big Mac but cheaper and without the middle bun.
But does anyone remember the spicy mcchicken?????
More rank the menu please
At the very start while Eugene was talking, it sounded like Braveheart......not Titanic.
Yes please! Do another one!
I had a McGriddle for the first time recently. It’s great in its own terrible way. Like it’s great but should not really exist 😅
Chicken McNuggets are like an old shoe. Eventually you’ll eat both of them?
We NEED more "Rank the Menu" videos please !!!!
WE NEED ANOTHA!
“When I’m drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken.” Same.
Idk if someone has asked this yet but Eugene should rank Energy drinks!
Comment, like, and watch TryFam so we can do this again!!!
PLEASE do this again!!!
I need more of this in my life!
*the ONLY good eggs are the ones on the McMuffin. the rest are powdered eggs. p.s.- you can sub a real egg for the powdered rubber crap on any breakfast sandwich (for like $1). AND, nothing better than taking your hash brown & put it on the egg mcmuffin!!!*
I LOVE SEEING EUGENE’S FACE!!! Makes me so happy to see him in the regular videos 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
We NEED more of this, Eugene and Keith together is absolute GOLD
Can anyone tell what the squeek is censoring?
Why does Keith always look like he's getting drunk and stoned at the same time when filming these?
Do I need another rank the menu? Not necessarily. Do I need more keugene content? Absolutely.
as a hotcakes stan I am very heartbroken (just had some this morning)
Hated it at first loved it by the end
Yall gotta try mchicken with atleast extra pickle and cuz I hate dry sandwiches I also do extra Mayo shit is amazing
The hashbrown is better than the fries. To the point where I wish I could put the hashbrown on a quarter pounder with cheese instead of getting fries.
Kind of sad they didn’t get a triple cheeseburger but then again I don’t think it’s actually on all menus :( but it has the best ratio of bread to meat to cheese to sauce
I LOVE Keith and Eugene segments!!!
Anyone else confused why Eugene isn't saying his quote right?!  "I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up!!"
POV: You screamed "THE BELL, THE BALL, THE BOOT, AND THE BELL KEITH!" at your screen.
The fountain drinks at McDonald's have extra soda syrup, which is why it always has a really strong taste. I've tasted their new chicken sandwiches and they're not very good. My sister always removes the middle bun whenever she eats a Big Mac. I love McFlurries and oreo is the best kind!!
Mustard and ketchup
The McCracken is not a dollar lmao
He did the soyjack face 🙃🙄
interacting so this performs really well
Please, please, please make more rank the menus!!! We love this combo here at our house!!
The real worst thing on the McDonald’s menu is the McRib
Would like to see a Rank the Menu/Eat the Menu/RanKing of 7/11 food (like the 7/11 branded food) Don't remember what they have in the mainland but in HI we have bentos with rice, meat buns and noodles.
AZ has hot n spicys INSTREAD of mcchickens and my mom (from Cali) despises Arizona for it every time 😂👎🏻
My concoction when I want McDonald's is the Quarter pounder with cheese, add big Mac sauce, lettuce and tomato.    Best of all worlds there. And when you are feeling extra fancy, small ice cream cone, ask them to place it in a bowl, and an apple pie.   Then you have pie ala mode after.
Damn... I freaking loved this so so so soooo much. Please please pretty please more.
i need a gif of keith talking about the steam from hashbrooms
Oh yea, McGriddles is a dream come true
yaaaaassss chicken nuggets are always the best
AAAH EUGENE MENTIONING INJERA MADE ME LITERALLY MELTT
I am so in love with their chemistry!!!
We need more of this segment! 😊💚
👄
You should definitely do another cross over like this 👍🏻
Effing Bradford pear trash tree
more like the gay guys
My little boy calls the regular burger the ‘depressed’ burger😃 laughed when Eugene said he felt sad eating it
Okay - Keith and Eugene have the best chemistry. Wtf, how did I not see this before? Please do more! 1M views in one day and I’m sure I’m at least a third of those views lol. Literally love this ❤️❤️
Unironically the filla o fish is my favorite. I agree tho, it is benefited with lettuce
When Keith mentioned Yellowjackets I got excited, omg such an amazing show!!! Also I love this video!!!
Rank the menu is the best crossover idea ever. Whoever thought of this idea deserves a raise
I eat fries with no salt.
What a freakin' great show you two put on.  PLEASE do this again sometime! Also [SQUEAK] Trees are the worst -- can we please delete all Bradford/Callery Pears in the US? Also also, the basic Sausage McGriddle is actually good, unlike the one y'all had.   Adding the egg and cheese is just way way too much.  Gotta keep it simple.
The US mcchicken’s look so sad. And the only difference is the bun! In Canada we have it on a sesame seed bun and it’s dope af I’ve never met someone who didn’t like it
The Canadien mcchicken is way better then y’all American one, y’all getting robbed.
Folded egg is prepared comes in plastic and steamed, the other egg is fresh with a broken yoke
The crossover we didnt know we needed!!!!
4:29 Tom Waits?
They missed the mark on the breakfast by not trying bagels.  Also mcD pancakes way better than ihop
You guys should do The Try Guys Try Irish Step Dancing
I worked at Mcdonalds as one of my first jobs, they put me on the grill making sandwiches my first day, and I kept making big macs with the quarter pounder burgers instead of the 1/10th patties, the shift leader didnt notice until he couldnt figure out why I could never get the big mac box to close properly.🤣
Big Mac remove the top bun and flip the middle portion upside down  or order it with different meat
More of this please!
Please, do it again!!!  I so enjoyed your riffs back and forth.
I love the difference in bite sizes Keith has the entire thing in his mouth then Eugene just likes a little taste
I love mcgriddles but without egg
Hey Try Guys Team!   I love all the videos you guys make. I've watched all your material.  I was just curious if you guys ever thought of balancing your more indulgent food videos with something for the community?    Have you ever thought about doing something where the Try Guys give back? Maybe with so much focus on food videos (which are hilarious, don't get me wrong) you could also do something about awareness around food insecurity? Helping out at a food kitchen, shelter, family services center, community center, friendship center?    Just a thought! Love you all, I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe.
i just want to point out that the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle is better than the sausage. the syrup just pairs better with the bacon
Keith eating the chicken pancake taco: not so bad. But the ranch…no lie I threw up. 🤮
The mcchicken is so much better if u take off the mayonnaise and add cheese I promise 😭😭
Yo better do a little research on what you are eating that is some f***** up food got human DNA in it
Mcgriddle comes first for me
I need more of Eugene and Keith!
The deep fried apple 🍎 pies were the best at McDonald’s, but they decided to go more healthy and changed a very good 👍🏽 thing that is bad for us to worse!  Surprise McDonald’s, we do not come to your restaurant for healthy choices.  KFC has an apple 🍏 turnover that is close to the McDonald’s fried pie 🥧 of the past, but no cigar.
I need more of this!
Personally I love the sundays but not the chocolate ones the caramel ones are amazing definitely #2 on my list #1 is the fries
The folded egg is frozen pre-made, the circle egg is fresh cracked egg.
Does anyone else want to see Keith it more mix of best and worst of food lol
McDonald’s Eat the Menu (Keith’s version)
When the McNuggets are bad, you’ll still eat every single one. When the fries are bad, you leave some in the bag. Just sayin lol
I'm about to date myself. But, McDonald's uses real eggs.... At least they did in the 80s. 🤭 The bread in the middle of the Big Mac is actually called the club.
I really appreciate that every ad I got during this was for Burger King
I love seeing this new duo. Give it another go for sure with the show combo
Wow! Our McDs apple pies are so different looking here in 🇨🇦
Yes more rank the menus! I loved this more than rank king and eat the menu videos
OMG PLEASE DO ANOTHER RANK THE MENU!!!!!!!! Also, Chicken Nuggets are TOTAL nostalgia food!
Lolol they are literally food drunk lolol Keith’s eyes at the end are slits lolol ong this was great! 💀🤣
Pls keep doing these for the love of god I’ve missed this dynamic
Eugene gets goofier with Kieth, and delirious with excessive amounts of food.. I'd like to see more of this format!!
I honestly wanted Keith to put his hot sauce on the chicken hotcake taco cause I think that would have been good.
I actually have a pair of converse from 8th grade that I refuse to get rid of because they are the most comfortable. I am 25.
Sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is my fav
MacDonald's food taste worse than sh!t.  Over priced and bad for you.  Only an idiot would eat there.
The way they will demonitize every video😭😭😭
The laughter in this was so great. Loved watching this show. Hopefully more to come.
Have they already styled each other for fun?
10:29 : Not naturally occurring.. 🤣🤣🤣.
Y'all should have gotten the quarter pounder Deluxe. It has all the veggies.
The combo of Keith and Eugene together is a beautiful thing I didn’t realize how much I needed. They are hilarious together
I'm so glad I haven't eaten McDumpster in over 15 years. The only thing worth getting at McBarf is the fries. The rest is just trash
Yes! We love a crossover episode!
Please do more rank the menus this was wonderful!!!!!!! This was actually the best crossover in cinematic history
I’m so sad that they didn’t make a mcbanger or try the hot n spicy mcchicken lol or the McBanger with a spicy mcchicken
THANK YOU EUGENE.   Ranch is disgusting and nothing will change my mind on that.
Do it again! Haha loved it
Yeeess, finally, a crossover episode
"THE BEFORE TIMES AT THE BEFORE PLACE" I'M DYING
I’m lovin it
“Never doing this again” “unless it does really well” #8 on trending
Okay, but a Southern-exclusive that tops literally everything at McDonald's is the chicken biscuit. It is one of the BEST in the biz.
You need to do a “rank chicken nuggets” episode because MCDONALDS NUGGETS ARE THE WORST OF ALL THE FAST FOOD PLACES
Pedo mustache
I love this crossover
I love Keugene 😍😭
Justice for the hot cakes they’re so good
I really like their dynamic
Am I the only one that doesnt like chicken nuggets??
can eugene do a ranking of all forms of cooked egg already
I put this into the universe with the best of intentions: Keith is the glue of the group. without him, I dont think the dynamic could match. of course they have proven, through the pod but also through the last few years of vids, that not every guy always has to be in a try vid. but if you had to sit down any three and say it’s not the same, it would be the three without Keith. Love you all the same 💛
Definitely more rank the menu I loved it.
Bell, ball, boot, bone.
I think the pope is secretly the Superhero named "Super-Gay!" (I was raised Catholic, so I know such things!)
Interesting how my favorite meal is #1 and my favorite breakfast item is last. Weird.
I dont know if this is going to gross some people out but I dip mcdonalds fries in the hot fudge sundae. It's a thing in the Philippines and it's great. 👍
Once, just as a test, I ordered a Filet-o-Fish *without* the fish.  Just the tartar sauce and the cheese.  And it tasted probably 95% the same as it did with the fish.  The entirety of why the FoF is so good is that sauce/cheese/bun combo.   But by the same token, it's dumb to pay 3 bucks or whatever for a cheese sandwich, heh.
I was very upset about the low McGriddle ranking but I appreciate Keith’s advocacy throughout 😂
This was AMAZING!! We need more of Keith & Eugene Ranking the Menu!!
More rank the menu please!
They need to go to a Frisch's Big Boy.
Am I the only one that hates chicken McNuggets? They just taste so fake and mediocre to me. I’ve never understood the hype.
The McGriddle, imo, is at it's best with bacon and no cheese.
Fun fact from an ex Carl's Jr employee, they started out with a hot dog stand🙃I wonder where those went🤷
The bacon, egg, n cheese bagel was the best breakfast item on the McDonald's menu and they removed it🤬  My next go-to is the bacon, egg, n cheese McGriddle.... if they remove that, I'm just burning every established down, and quitting McDonalds. 😤
The spicy crispy chicken sandwich at KFC’s is the best fast food crispy chicken sandwich…  Mic drop.
Do it again with Subway, please.
I see that yall do not value sobriety during these shoots and more power to ya on that front kings xoxo
This episode was great 😂 - I have to note though that Eugene's comment on mcgriddles, "if someone's eating this this is all they should eat for the day" is harmful and potentially triggering for your audience. Love you both!!
their comments about the mcgriddle had me rolling. its my favorite thing on their menu and i will never forgive them for giving me all day breakfast and then snatching it away again,
yes please do more rank the menus
I need a Wendy’s ranking
McChicken always needs extra mayonnaise.
I think this crossover needs to happen more often, I enjoyed this a lot
Cesar people judge ranch people so much 😂
My friend and I used to get high, and then go to Mcdonalds and order a McChicken and a McDouble and put them together into one sandwich, we called it the McDicken.
I wanna another eat menu/rank king
A girl I know really is named Sarah N Dipity.
Love that they are wearing McDonald’s colors
whoever does sound design/production is not getting paid enough idc how much they're getting paid they deserve at least double
Please more without a recipe videos!!
I for one, LOVE the McDonalds hot cakes. Gives me so much nostalgia for the first time I ate it, which was when there was a huge blackout in Toronto due to the Rolling Stones concert in 2003. Also LOVE the fish-o-filet and McChicken burger for nostalgia reasons.
As a Midwesterner I feel like I need to throw down a gauntlet about the ranch. Grew up putting that on everything, but mixing it with tobasco cuz I'm also mixed Boricua and need that spice.
I would love another video of you two doing this.
Sausage egg McMuffin is sooo underrated
yes please do another rank the menu, I love this so much
This is the most drunk Eugene has been
I once had a strawberry milkshake, and I threw up for days lol
Next episode should be Popeyes. For obvious reasons ;)
UUuuuuh yes to more rank the menus lol
please the Mcgriddles are bussing
At the end of the day one thing is true.. ya got to watch yellow jackets
I put a hash brown on the McGriddle with an extra hash brown on the side.😋
Eat lechon!
Mmmmmcdonalds
Ok but the McGriddle is easily one of McDonald's best items on the menu.
They should have dipped the fries in the tartar sauce.  It is the best
I have never even heard of some of these items. Do we just not have as large a menu in the UK?
We have one of those trees in the parking lot at my work. It’s in bloom right now and the air smells disGUSTING.
We needed some more just Keith and Eugene they are the sweetest and most chaotic pairing in TTG. Much love to everyone at second try🥰💖
The McGriddle is the BEST breakfast sandwich in all of fast food
McGriddle is the best
I wanna say that I can't believe becky is a hot cake girl, but actually that kinda checks out
10:19 he’s nobody’s dad
I just love Eugene and Keith ❤️ always good content when they're involved.
My breakfast McDonald's order is pancakes, hash brown, and a plan biscuit
Got my niece her first Happy Meal yesterday, so this feels very timely (she got McNuggets with like eight packets of ketchup, if you're wondering)
keith and eugene I am that mcgriddler you speak of. i fucking love them and i get them with no meat and a chocolate milk SUPREME BREAKFAST OPTION FOR THIS LAD
Y'all messed up by getting the crispy chicken sandwich. You should've gotten the southern style chicken sandwich. Superior by far!
What about Quarter pounder Deluxe???  I miss when they had the different sized big macs... The small one was perfect. Like the whopper Jr is better that the regular whopper. Better ratio. Sometimes I get Frisky and add special sauce to a couple double cheeseburgers
I absolutely love these two. Idk what it is but Eugene is always so silly with Keith and Keith is always so gentle with him lmao. Like I know it's all jokes but I love their dynamic
You gotta dip the fries in the ice cream tho
my testosterone levels dropped just by watching these dudes
Please don’t ask why I remember this, but isn’t that your wedding anniversary? 😆
i loved this video but JUSTICE FOR THE HOT CAKES
Eugene's chaos level fucking SKYROCKETS anytime he does a segment with Keith
Yes, this is the perfect hybrid, all the foods competing with Keith & Eugene commentary as a bonus!
The old shoes thing hit me lmao My converse from sixth grade have been worn in rain, snow, and mud, have tears on every side, no fabric on the inside, the laces have ripped in half, and you can barely tell what colour they were but I WOULD DIE FOR THEM
The greasy laugh after Keith’s “aBoVe ThE fIsH?!”
RATE TACO BELL 🌮 🔔
as a McGriddler™, 🙋‍♀️ mcgriddles are the ONLY thing I will purposefully go to McDonald's for. If I happen to be out of my house before 11:00 am, I will go to McDonald's. Any other time of day, I always choose A&W over McDonald's 🤷‍♀️
The spoon with the hole with used to mix the Mcflurry with a machine
I have an affinity w those apple pies. Before they used to fry them, before these current ones, they had like two full sheets of pie crusts sandwiching the apple pie filling and it was flaky and delicious MCDONALDS BRING THOSE BACK PLS NONE OF THESE COMPARE
Try Guys as the cast of Sex and the City: Ned—> Carrie Eugene—> Samantha  Zach—> Charlotte Keith—> Miranda   Honorable mention: Miles—> Stanford
Justice for the McGriddle!!!!
The McGriddles are an amazing product of our time.
‘Unless this does really well 😏’
29:20 the spoon has square top because it is attached to a machine that mixes the ice cram together with the Oreos. You can find the video on Tiktok :)
15:36 i need to know if eugene meant "shiny tier" (?) or "SHINee tier"
Fun fact: my cousin Tonya plays the older version of Allie Stevens in Yellowjackets!
They r so funny
More Keith and Eugene content pretty pls
they don’t have vegan burgers there????????
They r so funny
YOUR MCFLURRY IS SO BIG??? what is happening over there omg
No one cares get off the internet
Idk why but I love the hotcakes. They do have way too much sugar tho.
Eugene has good energy, he was laughing and enjoying himself. Loved watching it 😍 ❤
Eugene should rank Keith’s sauces, Zach’s tea, and Ned’s recipes
The McFlurry spoon is what they attach to the machine to mix it and Keith put his mouth on it 😀 LMAOOOOO
The world is so much better with these two together. More please
Yea this was fun, do another one!
I have come here to ask what came over Keith and Eugene when they came into the first 10 minutes. Come on guys.  You need a special face for the intro...maybe a come face? 😂😂
JUSTICE FOR THE BREAKFAST BURRITO
Sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is the best wtffff !? You need that round egg though not folded 😭🙌
YES RANK KING IS BACK!!!!
Just wait until they rank the mcRib
Mcgriddle deserved higher :(
Aren’t the fries cooked in beef extract? Lol
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes  in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️
Keith's bites are like 5x bigger than Eugene's bites, lol
Rank the menu Good Times Burgers and Frozen Custard!
I want justice for the McGriddle
Anyone else catch that sly dig at Becky? 21:40 "Yeah, they tricked  Becky with that for sure." 🤣🤣🤣
we need more keith and eugene pairing
Which one are you?? 4:30  I’m Eugene 😩😂😂
“It eats like a yankie candle” gold. Just gold
This was the best video this year so far!!!
Keith needs a Keith’s Ranch
Did you purposefully match the shirts to the pillows in the background
27:35 - Hey Sharon, lern 2 rite first!
I loved this
Can mc Donald sell their frozen hash brown to the market because I would buy it
Mcgriddle should be even lower. When I worked there the cooking them made the back smell like burnt ass
KEITH: A pancake chicken taco is a real thing! At the restaurant Pablo y Pablo in Seattle they have a fried chicken pancake taco and it is HEAVENLY.
Damn y'all are making me go to mcdonalds now
I love the hot cakes yum 😋 especially with McDonald’s sausage. But I also love a sausage biscuit with egg too.
Sing to me so I'll eat you 😂😂
Honestly, I don't usually enjoy Keith's eat the menus (because I can basically feel the grease throught the screen), but the 2 of them together was highly enjoyable. Great job!
I just want to know what the blipped out lol
LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!
my testosterone level dropped by 50% watching this
I NEED Keith to do a Mexican McDonalds eat the menu. It's ok if he only eats the staples but I'd love to see how the Mexican one compares to the US one.
to be fair the only time a mcgridel tastes good is when you are hungover and havent slept yet
When you didn’t like the McGriddle my heart cried
I’m a McGriddle Stan here to say!!!!!! I don’t like it with egg and cheese. Just a sausage and the pancakes plz. Yum.
Loved this. More rank the menu please! That being said, the mcgriddle is better without the egg. Just the sausage on those syrup soaked pancake buns
33:22 When you are in hangover at the sunday family lunch and you can't throw up
I definitely want to see more Rank The Menu!!
Mcdonalds fries are overrated mane
I want more Keith and Eugene content I like them ranking the menu it provides a good balance. Plus I feel so bad Keith is always just rekt at the end all by himself. 😭
8:15 timestamp for an excellent reference to an epic Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph SNL skit. I love you Eugene. This video was TOP TIER.
I love McGriddles but do agree it should be the only thing you eat all day 😂
GOLD. LOVE IT. more please? 💚
I’m devastated that the hotcakes were last. As someone who dislikes fast food breakfast sandwiches, they were a lifesaver as a kid
Thank you for Keith and Eugene video, we missed their dynamic.
Do you know what's funny after I had my first two covid shots McDonald's started tasting like chemicals and I can't eat fast food anymore its just doesn't taste right, but regular food taste normal to me that you make it home
This is the best dynamic for an eating video! Pleeeease do more
Keith & Eugene Tank the Menu (taste/rank)
Low key offended hot cakes are rated the worst because I loveee them LOL 🥲😂
keugene content >>>>>>>>
Just like McDonald's i gotta have more of Keith and Eugene
The McGriddle (with bacon) is pretty much the only reason I ever go to McDonald’s lol.
Raaaank KFC
The McGriddle deserved better
Greatest crossover of all time, The Rank King & Eat the Menu King in one video
How come I feel like I'm the only person who knows about the daily double.....
"mystery goo" is worse than c*m, Keith
The only thing i learned abt this, is that eugenes fast food taste buds are super basic bro tf do BETTER
More Keith and Eugene please
The pro move is quarter pounder with Mac sauce instead of ketchup and mustard, y’all. You’re welcome.
There’s no way nuggets are better than fries.
Who is the giver and the receiver?Also you two look like your going for a role in the next star trek movie.😂😂😂😂
Huge Hotcakes and McGriddle fan!
The McGriddle is amazing!
I always get a cheeseburger with Big Mac sauce and a mcchicken with extra mayonnaise . Or a filet of fish with extra tartar. Yum 🤤
McGriddle… travesty
THIS VIDEO RUINED MY DAY
TONIC is booming right now am I'm wondering if this coin is a good investment. Not much people talking about it.🤙🏼
Eugene you're probably not going to see this but you can tone down on your chaotic behavior. You don't have to exaggerate that side of you for show. We love the real you too.
Love that he says unless it does really well and its trending lol Cant wait for more
i feel like mcnugget taco with bbq & syrup would have been ….. better than with the ranch
Pls more Keith and Eugene 🙏 this is def what I needed today 😀
The crush Eugene has on Keith is crazy cute. Their chemistry is awesome. Thank y’all for listening to the fans
I love the ketchup and mustard aesthetic they had going on here.
Good video!
Please rank more menus!!
HERE TO DEFEND THE MCGRIDDLE
Not the mc chickens being a dollar in the states but in Canada it’s 6$ 😭😭😭😭 30 min worth of work for one McDonald’s small ass sandwich
Them: *eat sausage egg & whatever the last thing was  Me: *realizes I had that for breakfast* Me Again: well I guess it is on the breakfast menu
The flavor of the spicy chicken is always aweful.
This was a great team up video. Especially how food drunk you two were by the end :D Well done!
Shave you're mustache and leave the middle it's damn time.
omg as an Ethiopian born and living in England, I cant tell you the absolute shock and joy of hearing Eugene compare his food to injera! It's so lovely and comforting hearing words from your culture which are never said or explored in media or by the vast majority of western people; most western people who've tried it would more likely refer to it as 'Ethiopian food/Ethiopian flat bread'. There isn't a single Ethiopian restaurant in the entire county of where i live here in the UK, so hearing this made me feel ssososososo happy. SOOOO much love!
justice for the hot fudge sundae
Fucked up man
Keith looks like he doesn't wanna go
Eugene is not gonna fight for us
😵‍💫
This was excellent. *chefs kiss*. The crossover we didn’t deserve, but the crossover we all needed.
McChickens are like $2.29 in MA 😭
I want mooooooorrrrreeeeee
No one’s gonna talk about how perfectly they match the pillows behind them!! ❤️💛
We need more rank the menu! I adore Eugene and Keith together
Canadian bacon is just bacon strips, isn't the breakfast sandwiches just using ham? Maybe peameal bacon (Canucks don't usually like peameal bacon) or bologna slices? We have found something us Canadians get mad about...Canadian Bacon is just bacon strips XD Love you guys, mcgriddles are my favourite thing from McDicks
15:15 "what could be better than going to McDonald's then going to the movie theater?"   Uh. Bringing McDonald's with you to the theater? Haha I also bring wine ;P
The McGriddle is INCREDIBLE when you're hungover. That's all I'm going to say.
Can this continue to be a thing? These two are fantastic together
I LOVE the Sausage McGriddle & rank the menu was great
They need a heat tray or something to keep food warm. Mcdonalds is night and day from hot to cold.
Another rank the menu!!!
I’m with Keith on the McGriddle. It would be  in the top 10 of my ranking.
Rank the Menu is amazing
We need more of Kieth and Eugene!
Love this video 🤍
I’m obsessed with this please do more
Yes do moar rank the menu
I didn't know Eugene ate, lol 😄
McGriddle rights. Qlso, def need more Rank the Menu
oh i just loved this so much I love Eat the Menu is my favorite series on the channel, and Rank King is not far behind, plus I LOVE the chaos whenever keith & eugene are together. yeah i love this so much
Double cheeseburger is always my go-to. And McGriddles are gross. I said it.
Ok but RanKing mashed up with ETM, is literally BRILLIANT, there’s so much chaos here and I love it 😂😂😂😂
Oh my goddddd YES, more please!!
I can't believe they placed the hotcakes in last, those are one of the best items!
I keep watching Eugene’s crazy villain laugh over and over again
I always get an apple pie and Sunday and once I eat the fudge layer off, I crumble up the pie into the rest of the soft serve and let the pie soften up and it's Soo good! I've always done this and don't think I could actually not now
you guys should try butter sculpting I feel like it's just the right amount of cool and ridiculous for you guys to try
so i work at mcdonalds in the uk and my god your mcdonalds is Not It man
Eugieth.
I love yellowjackets 😍
McGriddles are against God and nature. I want so much to hate it... but I don't. Absolute Dark Arts.
I worked at a Micky D's for a few years and we had a regular who came in everyday for a large size Double Quarter Pounder meal and would refill his coke twice before leaving. His health deteriorated over the years to the point where he was dragging himself to our counter to order. Then all of a sudden he stopped showing up. A few weeks later, his son came in and informed us that his dad has passed. I'm not saying that Micky D's killed him, but just a reminder that everything in moderation.
I either eat like a child or have bad taste… maybe both but 3 of my go to items were in the bottom 5. The McGriddle is not one of them. I guess I need to try more things in the top 10
“Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet catholic” hoooolyyyy cow I can’t stop cracking up 😂😂😂
I miss the cherry pie!!!!
Thank you Eugene for calling out ranch! Hahaha!
Shout out to your sound mixer guy. He did a fantastic job at the music editing from Keith to Eugene opinions
When Eugene said the McFlurry is something you’re seek when drunk is 100%… I’ve walked 5 miles drunk to get a McFlurry
Yessss!!! Whatacatch is better than fillet-o-fish! Tho it’s the only meal that I order in McDonald’s. And yes, I agree with the ranking 😉
THE RANK KING RETURNS 🥰👑
As a McGridler, I feel abandoned and hurt :(
Please do this again. It was so fun to watch!
Got a BK ad during this lolol
We need a best to worst video for plant based burgers from all the top fast food chains. Pleassseeee
You missed the best burger... The daily double!
justice for the crispy chicken it deserves so much better —a highschooler working at mcdonald’s  ALSO the people who order them usually aren’t annoying so that’s a plus
Let’s all just take a moment to appreciate how much effort goes into these videos. 👍🔥🤯
What BS!!! Ronald McDonald House told a kid that had cancer,  his family to leave. McD's  has no soul and I or my family/friends will NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THAT BUSINESS AGAIN. Right Coca Cola??? Get Woke--Go Broke.  Standby AT&T, Direct TV, Concast, Xfinity. Potus 45 just called you out.
Please can we have more of rank the menu please!!!!
I want the Rank King to rank all 8 gens of pokemon starters
Eugene should be in more Rank The Menu videos!
This eats like Yankee Candle! 😂
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                                                                ,./,./,/.,/.,/.                     ,./,/.,/.                  /,/.,/.,./ ,/
In Portugal 2 apple pies are 1€
I agree that the McGriddle is wayyy too much. I can't finish one. My fave McDonalds burger/sandwich order is a triple cheeseburger actually. 2nd is the Big Mac and 3rd is Filet O Fish. Also I love ranch but McDonalds ranch is absolutely disgusting lol. I  LOVE Keugene! More of Rank the Menu please!
I don't really like potatoes nor fries, but McDonald's fries are the best. They should've been at the top of the list
lol did anyone notice that Eugene matched the red pillow behind Keith, and Keith matched the yellow pillow behind Eugene?
Keith: A CHEESEburger 😃 Eugene: not the double  😂
a week ago i said to my bf that try guys need to make a video combining eat the menu and rank king. imagine the excitement when this popped up on my feed. needless to say you need to do more of these! this is amazing! ♥️
“I once ate a quarter-pounder with cheese, and…I threw up for days.” 😂
WARTHOGGGGG
“We like to double-murder things.” 😂
I get the filet o fish and ask them to add lettuce. Burger kings fish is better though
I need Keith Eats Everything at Panera just so badly
Sounds like a right pair of yank  plonkers.
I feel very attacked by that ranch rant 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2 of the weirdest looking people I've seen
Please more rank the menu!!!
We need more of this. ASAP.
Also, the thing about the McGriddle is it tastes complex and amazing the very first time you eat it, but any subsequent time you eat it it's disappointingly too sweet.
More of this!!!
Bro why did u change the catch phrase to open wide?!?? It hurts my heart
Eugene and Keith is the duo we never knew we needed 😂❤️🙌🏻
I love the hot cakes and always will
New merch line: “We’re right, you’re wrong…OPEN WIDE.” 😂
wait oh my god i absofruitly loved it
mcgriddles r the best eugene dont get it🙄
Oh my goodness.. Eugene is the Samantha we all knew that but if Keith is the Carrie, Zach is the Miranda and Ned is absolutely Charlotte
I would LOVE them to pair up on a Whataburger video
More more mooooore of this!!
Here's the thing about the sausage egg and cheese McGriddles. The egg ruins it. I know you're probably thinking "but the egg is the only thing with any sort of nutritional value." You would be correct. Which is why it has to go. Keith's assessment of basically "it's bad, but you know it's bad, so it's good" is what makes a McGriddle great. You remove the egg and it transcends badness and becomes a glorious monstrosity of salt and syrup and cheese.
This is incredible.
I'm not a McDonalds fan, if, on the rare times I go, I only eat the chicken burgers whichever one they have at the time, Mcchicken or the Chicken mayo or a Chicken wrap, and then I get chips,  I do like the chip but some time god can they be really salty sometimes but then again being salty does make me drink my drink faster which helps is not get even more watered down with the ice lol  if I ever got for breakfast, I get the hashbrowns because it's a sin not to, and I just get an egg and cheese muffin.   the drinks are ok, sometimes you can tell they are watered down, which makes them bad,  but yeah I don't eat any of the beef or pork or the nuggets and I don't have any of the sweet stuff,   because the only way to get there is by car and sweet stuff and travel sickness do not mix well lol
Did the hotcakes dirty smh
Keugene!!
Re-subscribed because this video was great. More Keith and Eugene plz!
More RTM
did not expect to get called out for keeping my old as shit converse-
spoiler alert this did really well
They should have had someone throw the food at Eugene in typical ranking fashion
youre telling me the sides are the best?? YUP. Just like korean side dishes are the bomb
My grandfathers name is Frank.. I don’t want to imagine what Eugene is insinuating… NOOOOOO
This IS the greatest crossover in cinematic history. Two of my favorite Try Guys shows combined, I’d love to see more!
The scrambled eggs are liquid eggs scrambled, but the McMuffin eggs are an actual egg cracked into a mold. That's why it's better.
Justice for apple pies 😭 they are my guilty pleasure. I have ordered 24 of them and just ate them over the course of a week and a half. I regret nothing.
Now I'm on the way to McDonald's bye 👋
Best video yet!
The background music is SO loud at times lol
This was great :))
"My prosthetic arm... If it was made of apple pies" 🤣🤣 I literally watch these videos for the level of chaos that Keith brings but every once in a while he levels it up lol. Also I'm obsessed with the Keith and Eugene dynamic 💖
Ranking all the cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory
When I was a toddler, I fell off of a second story balcony and my parents took me to the McDonalds Play Place to make sure I was ok. Not the hospital but McDonald’s. It was my favorite place and will always have a special place in my heart. Late 80s/early 90s were truly the McDonald’s golden years.
The butterfinger oreo mention surprised me because it's not the first time I've heard about it. General Sam has actually made that himself in an old video
MORE EUGENE AND KEITH RANKING FOOOODDDD
More RANK THE MENU!!!!!!!!!!
This is utter heresy, the sausage McGriddle is elite and you cannot tell me otherwise
I just realized both Eugene and Keith are wearing the McDonald’s colors.
I'm glad that the Big Mac was high on the list because that's one of my favorite and I had it for dinner yesterday! I haven't had the fish fillet in a long time so maybe I should get that next time.
Yes, yes to all of this
I love this combo!
Can u do rank the menu but eugene sits on keith’s lap the whole time and he feeds keith
what carb-drunk on mcd’s looks like
McGriddle Justice!
The packing design is so much better at McDonald’s in the uk then it is in America
I agree with Eugene. Ranch is just not that good🙊 it's good on salad and veggies. That about it
I can never look at Keith the same after hearing that he doesn’t like the McChicken anymore 🥲🥲
I think the try guys should retry drag
Are we just gonna ignore the when I was a young WARTHOOOOOOOOG 🎶
If a waiter or waitress is waring a Mask I make it a POINT NOT TO TIP them at the end of my meal. Sometimes I will not even pay for the meal and walk out disgusted 😒
11:39 하나 둘 셋 I heard you Eugene. ㅋㅋ
.
Rank the menu omg
So I am old enough that I remember when the filet of fish came with a whole slice of cheese... key to ordering it today is order it with "extra" cheese AKA a whole slice. Thats what its missing ;) also means its made fresh, hasn't been sitting under the lights.
In no world is the filet o fish above the mcgriddle, r u serious
not the mcchicken slander 😭
Keith: 'crispy chicken sandwich' Eugene: 'hito babo pupapu'
rank the menu  is a fantastic idea i'd watch as many as you make
NO lie..  this was one of the funniest and BEst Try Guys videos I have ever seen!   I snickered through the whole thing and irritated  my husband..  😆  Hopefully you guys will do this again, this was a lot of fun to watch..
I LOVE McGriddles but I'm also chubby and eat 3 at a time
The quantity of advertisement is ridiculous. One every 2 min!!! I hope you guys are nor that desperate for money!
Gotta try a McGriddle with a round egg 💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾
I was born in 96 😂
No more “shut up”????????? Cmonnn!!
The big mac bun actually is 1 whole bun that gets cut in 3 pieces. We have a special spot for it in the toaster just for it.   The mcflurry spoon the divet in the handle is actually for the machine we use to stirr the mcflurry. The spoon then spins and gets everything together.
I like the combination video more!
The best crossover ever.
Okay a thought: Rank the Menu/Eat The Ranking for each of the highest viewed Eat The Menu/Rank King videos
someone english here. Today I found out that american McDonalds are selling bacon and egg scones and I don't know how to feel.
Definitely do another! 😂
The Emily cameo was hilarious! I love her
I can’t deal with the McGriddle slander coming from Eugene! But in his defense, the bacon egg and cheese McGriddle is ten times better than the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle
The sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is my families favorite and only McDonald’s breakfast item plus hash brown
what happened to “i’m right, you’re wrong, shut up” ????
I want ALLLLLL the rank the menus! This was amazing. I HAVE to go back and watch the original McDonalds one. Also, loved the Titanic opening.
“When I was a young warhhooogggg 🎶🐷”
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLES WTF IS THAT
Eugene and Keith look like ketchup and mustard...iconic combo...no wonder they go well on a hot dog😜
Not certain why I chose to watch this video the same day I chose to start eating well again..
Putting the Mcriddle that low. It’s so good 😂
PLEASE EAT THE PANERA MENU🥖🥪🥣
Keith and Eugene are my favorite duo of the try guys. I always laugh so much when I see them on videos together
Lol not me screaming about the egg differences at my screen.  The Egg on the Egg McMuffin is round egg, or just an egg cracked into a metal round disc on the grill.  The "scrambled egg" is folded egg, and is liquid egg poured into a square metal form on the grill, then folded over itself.  And the egg found in the breakfast burrito is scrambled eggs that come with the burrito mix.  My first job was McDonald's, and I still remember this stuff. 🤣
I'm 11 years old and I love your channel so much I watch all the videos you post your videos make me super happy❤ One day I want to be a youtuber like you, but I think it's still a long way away
we should make keith do a vlog on how he prepares for eat the menu and going home after shooting
Why don't you do this in a country where mcdonald's doesn't suck, and the menu/ingredients are the same?
We NEED MORE
Did you guys ever fix your hormone imbalances , I remember yall had the  estrogen levels of a teenage girl
The double quarter pounder vs half pounder is funny, cause someone came out with a 1/3 pounder and it didn’t terribly cause people thought 1/4 was more than a 1/3
This right here is why i've been a fan for the last 5 years
Listen listen, the fillet o fish is perfected by adding shredded lettuce and extra cheese, it’s my go to order from maccies
In the UK the apple pies are still fried and honestly it's the only thing I'm patriotic about
Eugene should really tone it back w the sexual talk, seems like hes pent up and a little too into keiths mustache, all around pent up vibees i wasnt expecting...
Hot take: McDonald’s nuggets are terrible
Im with Keith the mc griddle need be higher in the ranks.
Not going with Eueit seemed like a missed opportunity.
The only crossover to rival no way home
I missed Eugene
These guys aren't funny...
Please, Eugene, give us a list of things that also taste like cum 😂😂😂
McDonalds Hotcakes are the BEST
YOU HAVE TO DO MORE OF THESE!!!!
ANOTHER RANK THE MENU!!!
I love uncloseted Eugene so precious ;3;
I always thought when I become an adult I will understand all censored context. But here at 24 and I’m still frustrated and clueless.
Eugene is cowboy bebop
🙆🏻‍♂️
so what I'm hearing is that people who order nuggets and fries at mcdonald's know what's up
loved this crossover
a cross over i didn't know i needed
PLZ DO TACO BELL NEXT!!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😩😩😩
That is not called a mcchicken in Canada lol it’s a jr chicken and the one that comes in the cardboard box is the mcchicken
The McGriddle deserved better ranking. Lol
Fun fact. McDonald’s gets differently made soda. That’s why it tastes different
Bacon McGriddle is my go to lol 😂
More rank the menus!
I AM a McGridler.
You still have plastic straws?  We have crappy paper straws in Canada.
if it wasn't clear before, LOVE THIS
this, my dudes, is what i call ✨fanservice✨
I'm confused bc here in canada we have the junior chicken which is a dollar and the McChicken which is bigger, better bun and is 6 dollars. Does America noy have junior chicke ????
The best breakfast sandwich that Mcdonald's had was the Bagel Steak Egg and Cheese and they got rid of it😞
What a great video.
Yeah Canadian bacon.
Day 1 asking for try guys to try tiny baking
Love the McGriddle  but I only get it with the sausage!
when they match their pillows :’)   also they look like ketchup and mustard
“Famous internet catholic” 🤣
What happened to the breakfast burritos?? 🙃
and they said infinity war was the most ambitious crossover in history
It's ok Eugene. I hate ranch too lol
McDonald's fries are good but go cold real quick and there's no re heat value, once they're getting cold thats it 🤮
I hate ranch and my whole family loves it. My brother said that I was unamerican
Rank the menu of eugenes favorite menu or with a fast food menu Keith hasn’t done
I love the crossover 💖💖💖 my two favs try guys together. Combining two of my fav videos of the try guys to watch.
Gee the Oreo McFlurry with caramel!!
Eugene - prepare a regular appt with your GP because it looks like you guys are going to be doing more of these.. :D
I had a really bad day, and this made it better. And I'm from Canada :)
the greatest combo of try guys series
I'm watching this while eating McDonald's breakfast. I'll rank my order: 1st: Blueberry & Cream Pie, 2nd: Hashbrown with Mild Picante sauce, 3rd: Iced Caramel Macchiato, 4th: Breakfast Burrito with Mild Picante sauce :)
okay this was great PLEASE do this again. a rank the menu of wendy's would be great
i am a diehard mcgriddle lover 🙏 the chicken mcgriddle is my personal god im not kidding
More!!! You two together are my favorite!!
I’m offended that Eugene keeps pushing that McGriddle down. ITS SO GOOD!   Also, this is the kind of content I love! Please make this a series 💜
Now just bring back Topic Masculinity if you’re not too busy and we’ll be set for the year
The match up we all needed
the tree is real
You're from the same company but somehow this feels like a collab
Please do the menu at Red Robin
Mcgridle beings back bad memories. Got so sick after eating 2.
Whoever says that McDonald's is the gold standard of fry has never eaten A&W fries. They are so good they still slap when cold.
i love that they refuse to say buzzfeed and say “the before place”
Loved it! So happy seeing Eugene laughing so much
1) Add cheese to the crispy chicken sandwiches.  2) McDonald’s and chic-fil-a have the closest sandwiches. KFC and Popeyes have the closest sandwiches to each other. 3) Big Mac sauce on all burgers.
FILET OF FISH LOVE
Can I just say to everyone, please don't put your mouth on the top of that spoon. That goes onto a square shaped bolt on the flurry machine and is used to mix it. It's not a straw.
I absolutely loved this episode!!
This was one of my favorite videos recently!! I smiled the entire time and laughed and that Hakuna matata moment was priceless and amazing! 💛
When are you going to eat Del Taco !!!
Now I need them to rank the best things from every eat the menu
11:39 and Eugene counting hana dul set in Korean is so precious xD
Did they not have sausage burritos available??? Also, laughed every time y'all read the names of the food items and Eugene just *blushahsueirkt*
Mcgriddle buns are good by themselves but put sausage or others in.. not so much..
Wait, your hash browns weren’t $2 each??😭😭😭 it’s a scam!
In Germany they still fry the apple pie that’s why I was surprised how it looks in the US. Deep fried it’s honestly one of the best items ngl
I was really disappointed in your portrayal of Spike in the live action Bebop, among other gripes, but seeing you here you seem to be a down to earth guy, Eugene.
Switch the folded egg to a round egg on the McGriddles and biscuits and you’ll have an ExPeRiEnCe
These two need to rank the menu more and more!!!
The two best try guys. I will not be taking questions 😏
For some reason “well their last name would have to be dipitous” killed me
‘All this sandwich does is make you wish you’d have gone to Popeyes.’
This definitely needs to continue! More rank the menu!!
DEFINITELY the McGriddle should be higher, Big Mac above the hash brown. Keith should have used the syrup with his chicken nugget hotcake taco, that would have been so much better.
Bruh only $1 for a hashbrown would be a dream. Australia we have it for about $2.30? for just one.
Yo, this guy looks like Chozen!
“The before time at the before place”
They stopped frying the apple pie over 20 years ago and it bums me out I never got to try one, everyone seems very pissed about it
Did you know you can buy the McDonald's hashbrowns at Walmart in the frozen section.
I like that Keith and Eugene get to descend into madness together
McDonald’s ranking (2022 Try Guys version)
Say you are from California without saying you are from California:    "It was on the dollar menu, and you get get it for $1.08"
The chicken biscuits are the best breakfast item IMO (which I know are regional and not all McD's have them).
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLES!
This is why your testosterone is that of old women, boys. untuck and get back to working on being men again
Sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is my favourite thing on the McDonald’s menu. Not part of all day breakfast here in 🇨🇦 though.  P.s. chicken nuggies are the best McDonald’s item.
I related so much as a middle child to Eugene talking about being a middle child
Please more of Rank the menu!!!!!
I love this video SO much! Also so funny to see other people get crazy from the food together with Keith! Also: I am once again asking if we are ever getting that summer edition of the Starbucks video?
Everytime I get a Filet-O-Fish I always ask for extra tartar sauce and cheese, eat it fresh, and it’s actually delicious.
I, too, would always get a McChicken in high school (with a small fries and small drink). Now that I'm in college, I have upgraded to the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich and my wallet and body both hate me for it
The trick with the mcgriddle is you gotta get it with the round egg!
McFlurry is my honorary drunk snack, I’m proud it’s up there 😌
Ok but the hot cakes plus chicken nuggets plus the syrup would be the worst chicken and waffles hack of all time
Fast food eggs are fucking plain, texture sucks, and horrible.
i got a burger king ad while watching this
I am a McGriddler....and I put my hashbrown IN my McGriddle because it's so delicious.   Also, I can't not picture Keith with apple pie arms now.
It’s not a true eat the menu without a sauce plug
Avenge the MCGRIDDLE!!!!
The sausage mcgriddle with a round egg is top tier.
. There is a traitor among us 👿 . Press the button before we get killed 💢 . We are looking for a traitor in the chat 📃 . Sign up if you're not a coward 💣
I will not stand for the McGriddle slander!!!! It’s a full breakfast in one sandwich
Keith and Eugene has the color of mustard and ketchup
The hashbrowns are the best I don’t really need to watch this episode
If the try guys does Portillo’s I would be happy
If the hotcake taste like penis…. The only logical reasoning behind that is that that owner of that penis either 1) dipped their unit into bad maple syrup or 2) have diabetes
I paused this video halfway through to buy a McMuffin
“Half pounder?” I BARELY KNOW HER
We definitely need more of these.
the filet o fish is my tried and true… always get extra sauce tho it’s so dry lmao
the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle is SO much better than the sausage. I love the bacon one but hate the sausage one.
Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
I love who Keith becomes when he's with Eugene
Can say, the ranch thing is accurate.
Im Asian and the 1st time I ate Mcgriddles, it was truelly disgusting. But the second time try made me fall in love with it. I know it's weird
Eugene fun fact 2 shots of fireball and some apple juice tastes like a McDonald’s apple pie <3
luv u ned lmao (jan 30 11:18 rn and it be 23 hours ago na). aint watching this rn tho,,just commenting for the same day thing lmao
McDonald's fountain drinks have magic in them. They taste way better than any other place that has fountain drinks, even if it's the same product.
You need to put the butter and syrup on them pancakes. It's a game changer.
I’m the McGriddler… ummm WHAT THE FUCK GUYS
Keith is the only person who actually makes Eugene laugh. It’s adorable
"You know, they fucked this up, but you know what they left...'  'behind PORK RICE BOWLS.'
The before times at the before place lol
Though I worry for Keith’s health there should be more of these
Mcdonalds is the only company that gets their fountain soda syrup in stainless steel canisters, instead of plastic bags, so they really do have a unique taste.
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN!!!!!
Keith's moustache serves him well.
Where's the biscuits and gravy??
I love the hotcakes….
Hi Try Guys, here's a feedback. I love and anticipate new try guys videos every week but when I see eat the menu I feel slightly deflated, not because of the content but knowing there is so much waste. I wanna know if the team actually eats the food after because Keith usually takes a bite and is done with it. Even in this video, there was an opportunity to share one item (including the hashbrowns) and have them both taste it from the same item. The experience is even more candid in my opinion if they shared from the same burger, same pack of fries etc. I hope your team can at least let us know what happens to the food! I wanna keep supporting but aaaah this element is so frustrating. This differs so much from Mukbangs, where people usually eat the dishes till their plates are wiped clean.  This comment may get overlooked, but for anyone here who knows what happens to the food after these episodes or if they mentioned it before do let me know! I am curious to know as well
I work in a McDonalds in the UK and here’s a few pointless facts!  - the meat in cheeseburgers, hamburgers and Big Macs is a 10th of a pound. In my store, we literally call it 10:1 meat. - the McFlurry spoons are shaped like that bc they’re supposed to be mixed by a machine - the spoon clips onto the machine, which spins the McFlurry for 8 seconds. A McFlurry is supposed to weigh around 175 grams. - in order to combat waste, we’re supposed to use a measured amount of ingredients; for example, 8 grams of onions on a burger. This is not regularly done bc imagine having to weigh everything before you put it on a burger. - A Big Mac with no pickles is virtually useless, bc there are pickles in Big Mac sauce. - I cannot speak for all stores, but in my store, the milkshake machine is very rarely broken. It is often used as an excuse for the machine being out of the specific shake and sundae mix used to make the items, or a misunderstanding by employees when the machine runs too low and automatically enters heat treatment. In order to fight any possible bacteria, shake machines are put into heat treatment every night and are thoroughly brush cleaned at least once a week. Managers want the machine on as much as possible (for profits) and employees can get in too much trouble for lying about the machine being out of commission; if someone tells you employees lie about it, its not true or that employee could be strongly penalised for it.
please actually do this agin
You guys have to make this a series PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
Most people already have their favorites. It isn't like Mac and Dons is a new thing. This was a bit lame. They've been in business since 1955.
2022
you could probabaly do eat the menu and rankking t the same time again if thy were stoned since they could crave more food.
id love to see you do a canadian add on for this and for the original. just to see how mcdonalds poutine favors, especially with the new buffalo chicken poutine ( its spicy keith, soo prepare if you do try it)
I didn’t know I needed The Rank King and Eat the Menu to come together… but I did! This was awesome and among one of best videos they’ve released in a while. Please make more… Eugene requested the Popeyes eat the menu video and then wasn’t in it can we get that one please? Also would Keith’s opinion change on the second round?
Keith looks like Ned Flanders, in this video.
More Rank the Menu!  BK, KFC, so many good options to revisit!
I felt so validated when Eugene said that tree smells like c*m dude I’ve been saying that for years and everyone is gaslighting me telling me they don’t know what I’m talking about
I feel like there was a missed opportunity for the title Rank the Menu 🤔
more plssss
If it's not fresh, it tastes completely different. And there is no way that was all fresh.
can we talk about the LITTLE ONIONS ON THE LITTLE BURGERS THEY ARE THE BEST THING ON THE MENU
This is iconic. Not just because Eugene is in it (cause let's be honest, anything with Eugene is iconic), but Eugene and Keith eating and ranking a menu is the crossover everyone needed. Please please please do more! Sorry for your calorie intake, Eugene, but this is what we need!
KEUGENE MY BELOVEDS
Justice for McGriddles
Got a Burger King ad while watching this.
"In the before times. At the before place" That has me soooooo tickled
McGriddle is my granny’s favorite breakfast lol it should go higher…also this is now my favorite show🥰🥰🥰
£¢€¥~`1912
_"That was in the before times, in the before place!"_ McDonald's are launching the Chicken Big Mac in the UK for 2/2/22. It's a Big Mac, all the usual sauces, with McChicken patties instead of beef patties.
Best crossover, made me wheeze with laughter
Apple pies are still fried in Australia, so goooood
Keith and Eugene need to rank Buffalo Wild Wings' sauces and rubs!!  Please?
Loved having Eugene on eat the menu... Hash brown is number 1 for sure...nothing else matches
Eugeeennneeee ❤❤❤❤
The McGriddle does not deserve this slander. It is SO good!
i can only wat the fillet o fish and fries at mcdonald’s because i’m kosher. so it’s great for me (i haven’t tried anything else)!
Injera!!!!!
30:10 through 30:16 on replay 😂
The mcflurry spoon is shaped like that so it can fit on the mixer. They use the spoon they give you to blend it.
Maybe if we start a petition to GET them a heat lamp, they'll listen and use the one they have?
It’s funny how we don’t have the same things in europe
Made me get McDonnalds. Also, I watched the first McDonalds video yesterday 🤣🤣
Australian apple pies from Maccas looks wildly different
Please sir can we get more of rank the menu
I LOVE IT!!! I NEED MORE!! RANK JOLLIBEE FOODS
At this point Keith and Eugene could be ranking wallpaper and I would still be entertained
Love Rank King and Eat the Menu so I loved this ^^ After seeing Keith gush about hash browns, kinda curious to see how they’d rate different potato dishes (fries, chips, etc)
Hungry order UBEREATS
honestly Mcdonalds really just depends on when they last changed their oil. You can always tell how fresh the oil is based on the color of the fries..... It really really impacts the taste
Kegene is cute but they missed the opportunity in using Euith (you eat). 😏
I like the shows separately but did find the crossover even more entertaining
In Canada your McChicken is a junior chicken and we have another McChicken
Take a shot every time Keith says “let’s try it/let’s try the (insert food name)”
Bro he said hashbrowns are a single dollar… they’re actually $1.50 FOR ONE. Their prices have gone up so damn much the past two years. Like the three pancakes with a hashbrown is $5! That’s a lot for just that for fast food.
I can't even be in the same car or room as my son when he gets a mcgriddle sandwich. That would rate below the hotcakes just on the smell alone. For a long time the only thing that I would order at McDonald's was a sausage and cheese McMuffin and 2 hash browns and an ice coffee, but when they doubled the price of the ice coffee and the hash browns I completely stopped going there.  Please, please do more Eugene and Keith rate the menu! We definitely need more of them together!
Eugene's "gibberish," while introducing each item, is cracking me up!
As a person from Australia, American McDonald’s looks awful and sad :(
Order the round egg. Same price but they make it fresh.
Why did I not get notified? Youtube need to check themselves before they wreck themselves. Naaameeeeannnn?
Oh shit, y'all still get the actually flurried McFlurries up there? Wack. At some point over here they decided it was too hard, so you just get the soft serve the mix-in and a spoon, and you stir that shit in yourself. Which means you don't get that faint, buttery "whipped" flavour out of it. Jealous man, Oreo McFlurry with a shot of fudge sauce was 100% my jam back in the day.
I'm always getting the spicy crispy chicken with extra sauce, medium fries, and a sprite. So good
If try guys ever come to Ireland u should 100% review Supermacs!
Unpopular opinion: McDonald's fries are the worst fast food fries. They are just soggy salty meat flavored fries. (also not vegetarian or gluten free, which is dumb, it's literally a potato)
the Musik is so loud
Im from Texas too, the double quarter pounder is the one I crave the most 👀
The cum trees are the worst
I loved this Im keen for more crossovers haha
Lol "you feel bad after these" - keith
More rank the menu plssss!! This was so fun
Keithe's chaotic energy and Eugene's chaotic energy somehow work together and multiply each other exponentially... but it works!
YES WE WANT ANOTHER RANK THE MENU!!!!
Mcchicken is my absolute favorite item  can’t believe they ranked it so low😂
Keugene is a superior duo!
„Baby People“ 🤣
My dog loved this episode specifically for the squeaky censor noise
Can anyone tell me wt is the word they beeped?? 😅😅😂
I’m watching this hungover and it 100% caused all my problems and cured me of nothing! Nonetheless I’m enjoying myself!
I want them to a Rank King/ Eat the Menu of Whataburger. Gotta see how Eugene will defend or destroy Whataburger
Okay, but I kinda want to eat a menu.
Here in Brazil, the apple pie is fried, and it's delicious!!
1. This made me so hungry i had to make some nugs to eat while i finished the video 2. Never once did I understand what Eugene was trying to call each food item
As a McGriddler…. I am upset. However, love you both so I’ll move past it.
I have to know if anyone else remembers the Big n Tasty burger that McD’s had in the 2000’s. My adolescent heart was destroyed when they took it off the menu.
1:20 five years???? Ive been watch try guys for more than five years?
Eugene : samantha  Keith - Carrie  Ned - has Miranda seriousness/brains but obsessed with baby’s and his wife like charlotte  Zach is charlotte
am I the only one who is absolutely certain of how high they are
i am sick and didnt rlly have an appetite but after watching this video ima order some mcdonalds...
just starting the video… my baby hash brown better be top 2
I wasn't prepared for how much I loved this. I admittedly haven't watched all of them, so I can't say it's the best Try Guys video in a long time, but it's certainly my favourite. Keugene forever; more of these please.
Non-American here, what's a "Griddle"? Cuz the McDonald's in my country don't have this on their menu.
the entire aesthetic of this video does not go unnoticed! look at all the coordination of outfits to background colors. i am IMPRESSED. Keith genuinely makes me belly laugh, specifically with eat the menu videos (i’m sorry for your your asshole, Keith) but the vibe with these two is just unmatched.
Ranch on ice cream uhh interesting combo??
Eugene's tiny a$$ bites should disqualify him from ranking food entirely.
In Belgium, and probably other countries too, we have a 'royal o fish' and its basically a filet o fish with lettuce and cucumber. It's so good!!
I'd love to see more Rank The Menu, or just more Kugene videos
Pro-tip for the nuggets: Use the honey dipping sauce. Not honey mustard! Just honey. I know it sounds weird but it’s so good. Only works with McDonald’s nuggets.
What is eugene saying when displaying each item? English is not my first language... Maybe that's why I can't understand his mumbling here...
My favorite McDonald’s pie is the holiday pie with the custard in it I wait all year for that pie.
loved this!
You guys were clearly stoned
never have i ever realised how many different maccas items there are in the us!!
More of this
you really did wrong that mcgriddle
Keith, how how have you never had a McFlurry??!!! 😱 They're so good!
Hot cakes look like pancakes from the UK.
As a middle child I accept Eugene as our king
Bad idea to watch this video hungry 😂😂😂
I would loveeeee to see more videos like this!! This collab was great! 😀😀🥳 Keith and Eugene are amazing together!!
Fun fact: the "scrambled" egg is called a folded egg and the other is the fresh cracked/round egg. You can switch them out if you like one more than the other. Why do I know this? Because my husband has a strong feeling of folded > round egg so it's been ingrained into my mind.
definitely should do another onw
The best, you two are a match made in heaven
I try not to eat a lot of mcd’s buttttttt the McGriddle is the greatest breakfast sandwich ever and the Big Mac is the greatest burger … and I’ll straight up fight someone over it 😂
Keith said u can double the cost and make the same amount of profits...
More Keith and Eugene!!
How is there not a Keith Eats Everyone at Carl's Jr/Hardee's???
This video sucked.
Eugene not saying the name of the dish made me lose it.  He did it for every dish, but even though I KNEW it was coming, I still fucking cackled every single time he did it.
Question for Americans: what makes it a burger vs a sandwich? Here in Australia we’d consider the McChicken and the other chicken ones you tried “burgers” not “sandwiches”.
Thank you guys and looking forward to the next one!
Who goes to McDonald's for the taste?! It's just quick and cheap calories... Okay except for the hash browns... and the apple pies (in Australia they're still deep fried)
Hot cakes are so good tho
the mcgriddle was the first thing I ever had from McDonalds and it gave me food poisoning
The deep fried apple pies are still available in Australia. They are the BEST!!!!
YEEESSSS!!!!! THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I WANTED TO UNWIND MY SUNDAY!!! I love you guys so much!! Keep up the amazing work :D
I love filet of fish 🐟
They don’t do sundaes in Ireland anymore and it’s the worst thing they’ve ever done
Eugene saying "why is the filet-o-fish so high?" mult times has my pescatarian heart so happy. I actually like the filet-o-fish
This was so fun:) I would love to see more of Rank the Menu
love this!!!!!!
Yaaaay! the people have been asking and we have received :D thanks guys
Filet O fish!
I live for episodes that have both Keith and Eugene in them...please do more stuff together
We want this again!
Eugene doing korean phrases😂 Absolute love!
The old realm
BACON EGG AND CHEESE SANDWICH WINS 24/7, 365 for breakfast.
Finally another rank king episode
Would love to see more of these
OMG I can't believe they left the pope things in, that's so inflammatory hahahahahah
Damn honestly i dont know why this one bored me
Lol you guys should do Whataburger again in this format, let Eugene represent Texas
The apple pies were SOOO much better when they were fried
Definitely need to do this again!
You need to do this but with uk macdonals
McGriddlers UNITE
why is the background music so loud😭
what KEUGENE or KIEGENE do not know is that EUITH sounds like YOU EAT! Like this is worth starting some kind of conspiracy story yes? Or atleast a cult! <3 love from Belgium and yes, this is Belgium humor.
I love this. Please more Keith and Eugene! For some reason I especially love Keith introducing the foods properly and Eugene speaking Simlish at the same time.
5 on trending Wooooo
eugene just speaking simlish instead of actually trying to say the names of the foods got me every. time.
THE BLESSING
This is weird. I saw a bunch of items that German McDonalds doesn't offer... I've never seen the hotcakes lol But I guess that's because American pancakes differ a lot from German ones.
the mcgriddle is best with only the sausage!
Dairy Queen has a butterfinger blizzard... if you and Eugene like ice cream so much rank that menu... they also have chicken strips with country gravy... the best!
fries rock big mac too dont think mcnuggets deserve top
this is the BEST try guys video i’ve seen in sooo long!!
More crossovers!
Seeing the squeaks in the closed captions is absolutely hilarious
The crossover I didn't know I needed. We need more of these tbh.
Love rank the menu! Please do more! Two of my favorite segments! Lol
MORE OF THIS COLLAB PLS
when u go into a mc donalds and order fries as soon as u get them eat them because there so much better when there freshly made then when u have them delivered to you
Is the Sausage  Burrito not a regular menu item Nation wide?
McGriddles are frickin amazing!!!
The before times at the before place 😂
Has anyone else ever noticed that McDonald’s restaurants are often located near hospitals? It’s because patients want comfort food when they get out and visiting family members or hospital employees can grab breakfast or dinner any time cause hospital cafeterias are hardly ever open when you need them.  If you’re in an emergency and can’t find the hospital, look for the Golden Arches and a hospital will be close by. Here’s a hint too: always ask for your burger with something extra or something left out, like extra pickles or no onions or extra tartar sauce on the filet o fish.Then they have to special make your food instead of serving you something that’s been in the warming tray. Plus you almost always get fresh hot fries, which is the only time the fries are good.
Eugene @ catholic people: your church is so pretty and the pope's outfits are suuuper gay
Eugene's chaos level fucking SKYROCKETS anytime he does a segment with Keith
They're both giving off gay dad energy and I'm here for it.
Loved this crossover! Watching Eugene get delirious along with Keith was hilarious.
You can still get fried apple pies at Hawaii McDonald's. :)
You have to try the big Mac with the Sweet and sour sauce added!!! It's top tier! 👌
The fillet o fish while not great and the hashbrowns are the only edible things at McDonald's .
Petition for more rank the menus!
yall shld go japan & rank japan’s mcd menu!
why does Eugene look drunker than the beer and wine video
Our Apple Pie doesn’t look like that in the Philippines… And well we have Chicken and Spaghetti in our menu. And other rice meals…
Funny enough, the filet-o-fish has to “rest” for at least like 5 mins after cooking before serving otherwise it pops and oozes boiling hot oil from frying when bitten.
EXCUSE ME?? 2017???????
Liking the colour coordination with the shirts and pillow cross-overs😆👍🏼
The moment Eugene said there’s a type of tree.. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT. It makes me gag every time I walk by (I guess as they should) and for some reason, most California universities have them😩
Please do this again!!!! i love this rank the menu
MCDONALDS HOTCAKES SLAP
Our mcchicken here is actually pretty good and the spicy mcchicken is even better xD speaking of desserts we also have strawberry custard pie which is way better than the regular apple pie .—.
8:19 WAS THAT AN SNL REFERENCE?? FROM SUPER SHOWCASE SPOKESMODELS ????
my mind can't comprehend how milkshakes weren't here
This crossover episode must be a regular atleast once a month pleeeease! 😂💙💙💙
10:47 burger kings fish filet is so much better by the way! You should try it! But finally!! I've been waiting for another rank king video lol 😆
I felt like this was lowkey yellowjackets and sex and the city ad
I need more of these episodes!!! 😂🥰
I demand more Rank the Menu
McGriddlers represent!
as someone who has worked at mcdonalds, I've got to say i never understood why the filet-o-fish called for half a slice of cheese either! we never did anything with the other halves, unless another filet order came in they would just stay there in the cheese tub looking sad
Sea cheese or cheese-sea get it?? Lmaoooooo McDonald's does not taste the same anymore. Only thing that didn't change was the fries
"if I had a chicken, I'd just be sucking on that butt." *wants to be a chicken*
I need Keith to know that Big Boy invented the club sandwich burger 40 years earlier
Please do more Rank the Menu with Keith and Eugene
when I was a young WARTHOOOOGGGG
fries have beef in them, true story
I am kinda upset that they didn’t do what’a with Eugene, a texan
Love so so much. Please sirs can I have some more.
How did we never see this? Keith= Carrie  Eugene= Samantha Zach= Miranda Ned= Charlotte
The apple pie used to be good in the 80s.  It was fried and had a generous amount of cinnamon & sugar in the outside of it.
This was excellent. *chefs kiss*. The crossover we didn’t deserve, but the crossover we all needed.
JOLLIBEE RANKING!!
watching at 2 a.m., cackling away. love it. but also now want mcdonald’s 😕
keith making the mcnugget pancake wiwth ranch was horrifying
Crispy nuggets and hot well-salted fries will always be unmatched
15:05
Justice for the mcgriddle! That is the only thing I like for mcdonalds breakfast lol
Keugeneeeee
Is a biscuit over there a scone in Nz?
McChicken add Mac sauce 👌 my fav cheap goodness
This had a lovely energy
McGriddle rules bruha…….
OMG YES PLEASE DO MORE RANK THE MENUS!!!! Eugene & Keith are the best try guys PERIOD!! 💜💙
McDonald's sucks now
I stand with Eugene on his perspective on ranch 🤮
I just got to know that USA Mcd doesn't have fried chicken..
I... Really liked this. I honestly love Eugene/Keith only vids
Beautiful inter-try collab. I ♥️ the rotisserie comment around 29:30
Ever since Topic Masculinity I’ve loved these two together. They just work so well off each other!
am i the only one that feels like the energy in this video is so awkward. why am i the only one getting bad vibes omg
MCDONALDS EGG HACK! Ask for the round egg! Round eggs (like in the McMuffin here, if I’m not mistaken) are cracked and cooked to order in a ring mold, vs the precooked folded egg featured in the others!
I loved this! It was so fun to see a crossover 😂
JUSTICE FOR HOTCAKES
Keith, we stan the McGriddle.  It's so good.
They’re both matching opposite pillows behind them😂
How many fans this channel has ? 👇
IM RIGHT, YOURE WRONG, SHUT UP <3
Yes precisely $1.08 😂
mcdonald’s breakfast in the uk is now such a let down, they barely have anything anymore :(
If they don't do another fast food one I SWEAR TO HECK
Poor dudes. They’re gonna have to do this again.
The greatest crossover in cinematic crossover was iconic
“We won’t do this again unless this video does really well” Everyone : like, comment, share immediately
When I’m drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken 🤣
I love the rank king, I stan but the double quarter pounder & Oreo mcflurry need to be #1  🤣
I'm literally eating a filet o fish, nuggets and fries as we speak😅😆
I’m not feeling the on-camera chemistry.
ok hang on - @2:15 - as a Canadian i NEED to say: what the USA calls "Canadian bacon" we literally just call "ham"  IF IT'S NOT CRISPY IT'S NOT BACON, IT'S *LITERAL HAM*  rant over, gonna go back into my igloo now
Why this shit always make me hungry no matter how bad the food is
Why do americans call scones biscuits?!
It makes me so happy to see you being friends after so many years
I love the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle
omg I was excited to see rank king Is back with a twist !!! Ahhh
"I'm right. You're wrong. Open wide."  👀
McGriddlers unite!
In Aus the McFlurry come in-flurried and with a bamboo spoon that velcros to your tongue 🤢
Also Eugene’s brain can’t comprehend salty and sweet combinations and how superior they are, mcgriddle is #1
*chants*  do-it-again! do-it-again!
Yay! I missed the Rank King!
Apple Pies have been baked for WAY before Michelle Obama came into the media spotlight. Maybe 20 years. About the same time they stopped using trans fats and changed recipes for a lot of products.
The Kapok tree smells like 😏
Eugene being called the ‘Rank King’ adds an extra layer of humour for aussies
What McDonald’s are they buying from because those prices are way less than any menu I’ve seen.
Yaaaas more rank the menus! Lol
I LOVE McDonald’s pancakes HAHAHAHA
It's weird to see how in Italy we have less items and smaller portions 🥲
I’m getting concerned about Keith’s health.
Y’all ruined the individual shows, there’s no turning back from the collab now *will still be watching both though
Who wants to pray with me. Jesus is calling
Oh the McChickens are $1? Well here in Australia it’s $8 😀
“That’s how you know it’s a successful product: you can double the cost and have the same profit” wouldn’t that be the OPPOSITE? If you double the price on a beloved product wouldnt the profit ALSO double? The profit staying the same would intend the product FAILED with the price increase
Okay, so first, the eggs. The egg on the McMuffin is made fresh and the scrambled eggs are made offsite and reheated. Second, was something that I've now forgotten. Third, the chicken pancake taco needed honey instead of ranch.
My names Sara my mums name is Sharon and my brother is just james
9:15 Eugene is a hoot. I can't even 😂
absolutly love a mcDonald's cheeseburger, reminds me of childhood.
This was great! I don't know what a mcgriddle is (we don't have it over here) but I would love to see more of these crossovers :) Also I loved the comradery between Keith and Eugene, so great to see two guys just hanging out and having fun.
McNuggets is always going to be my fave 💖
The mcgriddle is absolutely garbage and deserves a low ranking but I am a garbage person so you can bet your ass I'll be getting one in the morning.
This combination of eat the menu and rank king is so good. I love the energy
Im here, bcause im hungry
honestly, justice for the mcchicken and apple pie because those sometimes are really good...but also sometimes not so i get how they ended up in those positions
3:19 yum 😍
Okay so I know it’s not the most popular item but the best thing McDonald’s offers is strawberry crème pie
Wow. I needed this.
I’m with you on the McGriddle keith
I loved this episode!!!
Honestly this could be bigger than both shows individually this was too entertaining
Does his sauce have mustard in it? And I've never had a BigMac because I know I would NOT like the sauce.
I'm going to need the compilation makers to put "when I'm drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken" in a video because that was GOLD
The chaotic energy in this video is everything! More of these please!
*Who* counted in Korean before the McChicken?!
I eat McDs 0-2 times a year, and when I do it’s the McGriddle
Eugene should try Furaido Kaizen's spicy, charcoal, and habanero ranch with their chicken strips and/or sandwich. It's a game changer!!
1:04 I love that 😂
I love the hotcakes, but they have to be smothered in the butter they give you ahaha. I think a portion of it for me is also nostalgia, because it's the breakfast my grandma would bring us whenever she watched us. :) <3
Y'all missed the quarter pounder deluxe/deluxe double quarter pounder. I think that would've ranked pretty good.
I would never eat McDonald’s eggs 😭😭
Please do this again, if you ever come to Australia..
Anyone ever tried ordering a cheeseburger from McDonalds, eat through it halfway and realize they forgot the patty and you were just eating a cheese sandwich? 😅
i rewatched keith eat the menu mcdonalds australlia the Australian chips/fries are different
Loved this
The bacon, egg, cheese bagel is the top breakfast item for me
Honey on the chicken nuggie pancake taco 👨🏻‍🍳👨🏻‍🍳💋
I am here for all of Eugene’s SATC references 😂
What a perfect series
I would watch more of this crossover, but with better food!
This is everything I needed today! So chaotic and so fun!
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLE!!!!
More rank the menu please.
That rotesserie chicken I laughed hard hahahahhaha that is definitely a keith mood 🤣🤣
Gotta say I love Keith and Eugene's dynamics. I feel like I don't see just the two of them  together that often but after seeing this would love to see it more lol
I'm so dating myself by saying this but you guys missed out BIG time on the REALLY great fries and hashbrowns when they were still cooked I'm beef tallow! (Sorry, not sorry vegans...) 😁
Do it again
Those apple pies in the US do notttttttt look like the Canadian apple pies!! Also wtf are all those breakfast things? I never saw those!
It's 2am and I've had bevs, this video made me so hungry for McDonald's breakfast and my McDonald's isn't open until 6am😭🥺
So I’m the only one curious on how they had breakfast and lunch items?? What they do? Get breakfast items and then wait?? Or did they do this right at 11?
i love how at the end of any eating episodes, keith seems drunk😂
How is the fish burger so high?!
rank the menu popeyes!!! because Eugene wasnt in the popeyes video >:(((
Sea cheese
Canadian mcchicken is point,  totally different than the U.S.
new comfort video alert
Best eat the menu!!! I can not go back to the normal way. We need eat the menu ranks!
If you knew „could it it be beef? I don’t think it’s beef?“ was an SNL reference you’re my friend 😂😂
I think the order was very reasonable
There are two types of eggs at McDonald's the round egg and the folded egg.  The round egg is an actual cracked egg that is then sorta poached.  The folded egg is liquid eggs made from eggs and mixed. But it goes on the grill as well.  The round egg is superior, and the mcgriddle tastes better with it.
Please more rank the menu!
Please more rank the menu!
I, too, hate the square egg from McD, but you can usually substitutive a round egg (which are real eggs made fresh) instead of the weird frozen scrambled egg.
Yes to Ranch dressing and to cheese!!! 🧀🧀🧀 I LOVE breakfast food 😍 I've never actually tried the fillet o fish so maybe I will add it to my list.  I'm trying 20 new foods in a year (not on the same day like you guys 😜). I've already tried pickle potato chips, chocolate hummus, kimchi, hot pot, arroz con leche, and eggnog! I want to try green olives, Korean corn dogs, a banh mi sandwich, a cronut, chickpea pasta, and while I'm not a fan of seafood, I did like fish sticks as a kid and tartar sauce is cool, so let's add the McDonalds fish sandwich.  If you have any suggestions for my list let me know. (Nothing extreme / gross! I'm trying to expand my palate, not be on Fear Factor, thanks 😉😳🙄😁)
This was amazing to watch, even though I dislike McDonald's because when I was a kid, I had some after a chess tournament, and as soon as I got home, I projectile vomited all over the living room wall.
Apparently this is a Keith’s chicken sauce emergency. Go Alexandria go!!
Keith is heartbroken his McGriddle is at 17, I'm still furious the hashbrown only made #3.  Its the best thing they do by a mile dammit!
You two have such great chemistry. You guys are a delight.
Rank the menu buca di beppo. That place is so good for chain Italian.
The Biscuit and McGriddle sando's are really let down by that crappy from a carton yellow egg.  In Canada, we get the McMuffin egg, which is a real egg cracked into a circular mold, for all the sandwiches, its bomb!
did the breakfast wrong…best is a sausage mcgriddle with a round egg.   also, filet-o-fish is trash
Mcflurry actual worst food item ever
McDonald’s fries expire after 5 minutes.
Chicken Mcgriddle is the best breakfast food., the fact that the sausage and egg one represents McGriddles makes me so sad
my fave duo <3
This video is entirely too long. Was this really worth doing for a video people are going to watch half of, if that?
I disagree with the ranking and agree with Keith. The mcgriddle and the hash brown are the best. Though in Canada we get the real egg and not he microwave garbage.
I remember when does McDonald’s apple pies were deep fried Lil Wayne McDonald’s had supersize everything milkshakes fries drinks. And then they decided they want to get healthy and get rid of the supersize Because apparently America’s too fat
More rank the menu with Keith and Eugene!  Sorry Keith.
eugeith
Mcgriddles are terrible. I will be mildly bruised to defend this hill.
Best is to get the DoubleQuarter, with cheese "dressed like a Mac".
I'm still pissed at McDonald's for eliminating salads and fruit and yogurt parfaits. I used to eat filet-o-fish, salad, parfait and water. Now, I boycott McD's except for the during lent when the fish is on special. Even then, I'm so disappointed without the salad to go with it.
Rank all the menu's please
I usually let Eugene do his thing in these but man… the mcgriddle review hurt. Although my order is the sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle.
Justice for McGriddles 😫
Best crossover 🥰
Here to say just order a plain sundae with oreos added and hand stir it.  Cheaper, better serving size, and it's actually mixed thru by you instead of eating the first half and having no topping in the second half.
I didn't know I needed this. But this is perfection
McChickens near me are $1.67 now
Another Rank the menu please
This was BOMB DIGGIDY!!!!! pleeeeeease make this a thinnnng!!!!
Keith- “the Oreo McFlurry” Eugene- “chi… boo boos”
DO IT AGAIN.   And combine Candid Competition with Ned and Ariel doing a date thingy. And Zach and Miles have to send them out into the field (and Walmart) while they babysit.
Eugene sort of looks like Gia Gunn
My grandma was a “who wants a happy meal” grandma in the late 90s. My parents were not. So at around 9 years old I stopped eating it and now I have started again at 26 and I still only get fries and chicken nuggets
As I watched Keith dip that tasty nugget in ranch, a part of me died inside. And then Eugene said he didn’t like ranch and I have never felt more heard in my life
Fun fact for those that haven't worked at a McDonald's... the only difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger is 1 slice of cheese.  That's all.  Also you can get a cheaper big mac without that weird middle bun if you order a mcdouble sub macsauce, and add shredded lettuce....
The Telephone Gaga-Beyonce collab of the Try Guys line up
Wait where are the cookies? And muffins? Are those not deserts?
Great Eats the Menu/Rank King mashup!
Did you guys dress like ketchup and mustard on purpose?🤣
I love seeing Keith and Eugene together making a video; we don't get to see this duo very often ❤️
next do texas roadhouse, beni hana, or red lobster
*me, an empath, sensing they are drunk*
Double dipping animals 😂
whY the fUCk does the apple pie look like tHat now
No frozen coke 😢
what's with americans and calling peameal bacon "canadian bacon"? bacon is bacon in canada too. the flat thick one is called peameal ham or peameal bacon. . Drives me nuts when people call it canadian bacon. we don't have fancy canada specific bacon.
💕💕💕Keugene 💕💕💕
The McGriddle is superior to everything at McDonald’s!!!!!!!! I’m upset😂
mium mium good fish haha jk
yes
middle child representation we all need
I work at McDonald’s and also the ice cream machines just suck ass like I promise they annoy us much more they they annoy you with how fuckin broken they are all the time and the people never actually come to fix them we are at the mercy of those machines every day I haaatteeee them
Am I the only one that loves the hamburger, the plain ol' no cheese hamburger? It be the best.... and when it comes to sauces, Hot Mustard #1. No lie, no filter.
Keith hearing “when I was a young…” and immediately going to Lion King made me so happy I just rewatched those five seconds multiple times. That’s what I need in my YouTubers: their brains to go right to Disney
Wtf is going on at American McDonald’s? That third burger, the sausage one, sounded so heavy when Keith dropped it.
I need this crossover for Taco Bell!
for some reason it erks me that the worst is on the right and the best is on the left.....
#6 on trending today, y'all definitely need to Rank the Menu again 😆
sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is elite. It's the only thing I get at mcdonalds.
Most anticipated crossover event since That’s So Suite Life of Hannah Montana
They forgot the sausage burrito 🥺🥺🥺
Cheese on a mcChicken makes it 10x better
This was lovely.  Even if y'all didn't do a whole menu ranking, the combo of menu and ranking was fun.
Eugene takes too small of a bite to do the taste test.
we need more of these rank the menu is amazing
21:47 the way he immediately regrets saying "milks keith [hand motions]" 💀💀
please do another one this was amazing it was so good
When Eugene said Samantha's line, I immediately quoted Carrie!! "Can I cancel my rice pudding?" 🤣🤣
Keith and Eugene: High or just drugged from the McD's preservatives?
You need to get up to WA and to Zips sometime.
They're so right, the pies are disgusting!! I accidentally fell for their 2 for for 1 special and spit it out. They taste like dry crackers with a too sweet filling. Not what I was expecting. Back in the day they were sooo good!!! The fries are good now, but they were so much better then too, before they changed their oil.
Saying the name at the same time, with different names hahahahahaha
As a Sharon, I approve of this episode 😂
I actually work at McDonald’s 100% we change the syrup to carbonation ratios and the bags (which are more boxes with bags in them) get changed at least (at my location) 3 times a day
A single hashbrown is $1.89 here now...absolutely ridiculous.
Im surprise Keith don't have a Fish Sauce
This is amazing and well u heard Eugene unless this vid does well they wont do this again soooooooooooooo GO LIKE THE VID
Eugene: “we’re never doing this again” Keith: “probably not” Eugene: “unless this does really well”  *#6 on trending 11 hours after this video was posted*
Keugene > cute jean > you’re cute jeans
"...and I threw up for days." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
The best and worst = the chicken McGriddle 😆
I totally 💯 agree that chicken nuggets are number 1
I rarely ever eat anything from McDonald's because I get disturbingly violent stomach problems from most of their food. That being said, there are exactly two items on the menu that I can eat without much of a problem. Those are the chicken nuggets, and the McGriddle. I don't understand why it's specifically just those two, it just is what it is.
Better than mcdonald then hoping to the movies? How about mcdonalds at the movies?
I LOVE THIS! All eat the menus need to be like this. The new favorite eat/rank the menu 💜
justice for the apple pie
32:17 I can’t stop replaying the sound of that high five
Need MORE!! How about KFC or  BK?? Wendy's?? We NEED This!!!
The apple pie was way better than your ranking.
this is chicken snack wrap erasure 😤
the subtitle's timing is a bit off
Heeeey where are the salads?
I always ask for shredded lettuce on my filet o fish. My mom taught me to order it that way. Never order it regular. With lettuce, it’s amazing.
Sweet now let’s see how all of these animals were raised…
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
I love the filet o fish, also the McGriddles should be lower because they chose to make it plural instead of singular. Yes, that is a thing.
I love that Keith makes jokes for himself and then just laughs and looks at the camera
mc donalds cones are the best sorry Dairy Queen
This is my contribution to get the views going so we get more of this series
Keith, I love the 'stache. Do whatever you want always obv, but know I support you in keeping the mustache as long as forever.
Literally my favorite is the sausage egg mcgriddle but with the round egg instead of the folded egg
I've never so severely disagreed with rank king's decision. Chicken nuggets are sponges and the hot cakes are amazing.
Okay but the deluxe crispy chicken sandwich has tomato and mayo and is so much better than the regular crispy chicken sandwich
We middle children appreciate and accept you as our spokesperson
obsessed. need more of these two
More rank the menus pleaseeeee
The chaotic energy that was coming off this was incredible
You both should do more of these
Eugene ranks nostalgic/ 90s cartoons
Seriously, has Eugene never had a blizzard at Dairy Queen? Far superior to the McFlurry!
I need more of this duo in my life
I was dyyyyyying over the Bradford pear convo! My mother hated cursing and thought so many words were crass yet when the Bradford pears would bloom she would complain about the nasty c*m trees 🤣
Honestly if you want like sausage egg mc muffin go to tim hortens. Unless your in america
I agree with Eugene in hating Ranch.
Me named Frank : 😅
Cry laughing at this mash up video, so good!!!
i am sorry it been 82 year  u wanna hear it or not Mr. love it  its been 82 years and i can still smell the fresh paint , the china never been used , the sheets never been slept in. Titanic was called the ship of dreams  and it was; it really was
The rank King has returned
This was awesome!
More Rank the menu please 🙏🏻💖
Eat the Menu Dutch Bros
Why did they get two of everything? Feels like the perfect opportunity to finally not waste as much food.
Didn’t know what the censored word Eugene was saying was UNTIL HE MENTIONED THE TREES 😂
I love this!!!
Would love to watch more Rank the Menu!❤️
Justice for McGriddle!
I have literally the same McDonald’s food ranked opinion as Eugene :)
How was the sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin not above the ham one? It's so much better.
Placing the McGriddle and McChicken that low is wild but everything else is basically right
PSA: don’t watch this at midnight when you’re high bc McDonald’s is closed
what about the chicken tenders?!
McNuggets, then fries, then hash browns? My elementary school self would've said the same. Apple pie would've been in the top 4 as well, but like y'all said... It was fried back then.
The original McDonalds was in San Bernardino. It's closed now but there is a McDonalds museum there. The one at Downey was one of the earliest franchises and is the oldest still operating.
My mom loves the bun of the hamburger
I am convinced fast food was better when I was younger like the McChicken was spicier and crunchier now it’s like wet and not much flavor, am I the only one who thinks that?
Eugene needs to rank Whataburger items with Keith and he needs show him how wrong his fews on the food! Especially the honey butter chicken biscuit. As a fellow Texan this needs to happen.
I like the Buzzfeed Shade lmao
I don't care what anybody says the mcgriddles are delicious!😤😋
I'd love to see more of this kind of thing!
I don’t agree with the chicken nuggets….cardboard!!!
i'm so sorry that i laughed so hard i almost choke on my macaroni when keith and eugene started trashtalking the p0pe 🥴
My ass legit paused the video half way through to go buy McDonald's.
RANK THE MENU NEEDS TO STAY
this feels like two tv shows have a crossover...
This is wonderful, I hope they do more! I can't stop humming the "Keith and Eugene" song from Topic Masculinity.
My go two items are mcchickens and fillet o fish
I hope they didn't throw out the leftover food
is it just me or are McNuggets incredibly inconsistent.  when they are good and crunchy they are fire, but sometimes they have the consistency of shoe leather
The fries in the not beef section is misleading, as they actually contain beef byproduct
I actually love the McGriddle
Fillet o' fish is the quite an underrated menu item
OMG. I really hope that there'll be more videos like this one!!! 🙆🏼‍♀️🖤✨ Super enjoyed watching both of youuu!!! 🖤🖤🖤
I high key started craving McDonald’s mid way, so I paused the video and went and got some 🤣💀
Yes! Rang King and Eat the Menu! Omg, dreams do come true!
“The smell is just slapping me in the nostrils.”—Eugene  😂
I feel like I'm the only person who hates the nuggets. I always get a hard bit and they smell like puke to me
As a McGriddle stan, I am offended that y'all ranked it so low. 😤  Also, you can tell that Keith and Eugene are pretty close and spend a lot of time together outside of work because of how well they vibe together. It literally felt like I was watching two best friends just being dorks together. 🥺
I miss the bacon egg and cheese bagels but sadly they are not coming back to the menu RIP so I am partial to the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle
Keugene but what about Eugeith
I don’t like ranch it’s all about Bbq sauce lol
Watching this high was a real treat.
Man, by the end of this video I had to go to McDonald's and get a hot fudge Sundae and a mcdouble
the bacon egg cheese bagel and the french fries are the only two things I like at McDonald's lol
Legit u had me rewinding the first 15 seconds 15 times before actually proceeding to watch the rest of the video that was truly hilarious 😂
Nice video now do it with real Americans
We need more rank the menu. I would like a in and out version of this that would be cool.
Lmao this is more like Eugene ranks McDonald’s foods and Keith is there for moral support.
omg eugene quoting the beef SNL skit w kristen wiig
This is the first time in quite a long time that I’ve actually laughed out loud a few times during a Try Guys video -funny stuff, guys! It’s not that I don’t enjoy the other videos, but this one was next level funny for me. When Eugene relaxed into it his cheeky grins were completely infectious. Keep it up 😘 👍
I LOVE everything about this
I wholeheartedly believe that Eugene’s “could it be beef” is a reference to the super showcase models snl skit
If what they had in the sodas was coke, it tastes “better” (or at least different) than other fountain cokes bc Mcdonalds and coke have a partnership going on. The coke syrup doesn’t come in bags to get diluted down like at other places, it comes in these big stainless steal containers. Somehow that keeps it fresher idk.   Also the boys are right, Mcdicks straws are slightly wider than most normal straws. More drink per drink is always better.   There’s even more that goes into the soda. McDonald’s takes it mad serious that a McDonald’s coke from California should taste the exact same as from nyc or London or wherever you may be.
This is such an iconic fucking duo, this is what we needed
People blow this up with likes and views
PLEASE do more of rank the menus. this was sooo fucking good and I NEED more thank you so much for it already!!!!!!
Wait why isn't Eugene saying shut up anymore?
Keith eats everything at McDonald’s (try guys version)
I cant convey tone enough in this comment. DO NOT STOP DOING RANK THE MENU
LOVED THIS VIDEO PLEASE MORE KEITH AND EUGENE CONTENT
More rank the menu- this duo is just everything
This isn’t taking into account that the first bite of their burgers tastes fantastic and the last bite doesn’t even seem like actual food anymore. Also get “add mayo” on a quarter pounder it takes it to another level.
Please rank fast food french fries.
Keith and Eugene are great together . But Keith needs justice for the poor McGriddle. While I don’t like the folded egg and usually remove it. The round egg has a better taste. I would recommend the chicken McGriddle add cheese. It’s like chicken and waffles.
"You only like it cause it has his face"  Me who got a Gfuel shaker just because of a poketuber I like: Yes, but logo
Eugene is wrong about the plain burger. "Bag of burgers" was a staple for road trips! It still holds up, thank you Keith!
Keith is the only person who actually makes Eugene laugh. It’s adorable
This was iconic 😍
I need like a few more of these rank the menus please
They match the pillows! So coordinated
oh yes this had to be done! Great idea.
Keith and Eugene rank the outback menu get fked
I’ve been fortunate enough to eat at some of the best restaurants all over the world and for reasons I cannot explain…a Big Mac and fries are still a guilty pleasure. Makes you feel like shit after, but you can’t deny they taste good
I remember when hash browns were .50 cents. 😆
I both love and hate the whole ketchup and mustard thing they have going on in this video 😂
Random thing i wanted to say but i love seeing Eugene being more happy and open, in the older videos he was always the “mature one” or the “tsundere one” but i love this happy Eugene much more. Seeing him relaxed, happy makes me also happy and relaxed. ❤️
Neither of my favorite breakfast items where on this ranking haha. I love the sausage egg McMuffin and the sausage burrito.
Hash browns #1. Nuggets are lower than hash browns and lower than spicy chicken. And fudge sunday needs to be moved way up. Kiss Kiss for jokes. Jokes very entertaining this episode.
fillet o fish fuck dude. Like from warching this whole video now do you know what i wanna get from mcdonald's? fillet o fish. Like they don't sound good and they have a steep drop off like the fries but wow get that and hot fires and a soda/chocolate milkshakke as a meal? s tier.
They say breakfast is all day, but the one here in VA is until 10:30 😪
Eugene making up bullshit as he goes along reminds me of markiplier makes
Um i love you guys but hotcakes being number 20 is a little shady
You can still get the deep fried apple pies in Hawai’i and they are so much better than the baked ones imo
What if candid competition, eat the menu, and rank king in one grand video! Zack will pick the restaurants, Keith will do the tasting, and Eugene will do the ranking. A beautiful chaos of thoughts and judgement 😂
Honestly I think Rank the Menu is a super good format. Definitely hope we get more of these.
Missed the opportunity to say Euge-keith instead of Keith-gene.
No mention of the fillet of fish steamed buns!?!?
.... dating a Frank, can 100% confirm.
Love that Keith and Eugene look like mustard and ketchup lol
Ginkgo trees also smell like ass.
Loved the crossover. ❤️  Australian Maccas still has the fried apple pie and Asian countries have the banana pie. Australia also has the Angus burgers and they are 👍
the most eye opening thing about this was the prices - I live in Canada and all of these combined would be just under $100, but it sounds like everything is so cheap there?? $1 for a McChicken, our closest alternative to that is $2.50
Hot take here, the cheap McDonald's patties are significantly more delicious than their "higher quality" ones. The double quarter pounder has so little flavor compared to the shitty little double cheeseburger. Also, the Big Mac is better without the middle bun.
I hope there are more videos like this!! It was too funny
Holy shit, you unlocked A lot with that chicken nugget commercial. I remember getting the character in a happy meal
See, my go to when I'm buying for myself? The triple cheeseburger from the value menu. Its just the right balance of meat, cheese, filling and buns for cheap. Especially since they got rid of the chicken snack wraps 😭
Would love more crossovers like this with different fast food places! Also I am slightly hurt about the McGriddle ranking 😂
yes more rank the menus please!!
this video truly shows how strong Keith is. Eugene is far more food drunk because it's his first time. 😂 This isn't Keith's first rodeo
Omg if only the McDonalds cookies were there. But great video
I didn't realize I was a McGriddle stan, but here I am coming to its defense 😤  But Wawa's short lived version was better
EUGENE IS BACK
More 😂
Sausage bacon mcmuffin is what i get for breakfast when i do. Yall messed up with that fake ass Canadian bacon.
Please make this it’s own thing. Best of both worlds
Whole time I was just thinking "wish Keith was ranking these too"
More Rank the Menu!!
Y does he cover up his tattoos?
"When I'm drink I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken!"
when worlds collide, I love it😌
Also no chicken McGriddle, it’s the best thing on the breakfast menu
So funny
neeeeeeed more of these
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
Eugene .. known as the devout Catholic. I had to pause so I could laugh adequately
DO THIS AGAIN DEFINITELY!!!
I love that I got McDonald’s on the way home and this is what I find on my feed
"but of course that was in the before times in the before place" I'M WHEEZING
I loved this
Please make this a series! This is the greatest crossover ever!
when i kept saying the og line of "im right, ur wrong, shut up" and them not actually saying it 🙂
Justice for McGriddles. But also, the egg is what ruined it, I promise. Sausage McGriddle with cheese is bomb.
omg i die at all the 💦 jokes. did y’all film this after the weed episode?
Eugene "i sound like a batman villan" me: id watch that for sure
So fun (gross) story from when I worked at McDonald's, the Filet O' Fish buns are the only ones (ore they were at the time) that were steamed. One day as I was taking a bun out of the steamer I hit the wrist of my dominant hand against the top of the hot, steamy metal. Quite possibly my worst burn ever
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Eugene needs to try the sausage McGriddle. It’s so much better without the egg and cheese
Woop Woop  "Funky Spunk".
The coke at mcd  is the only food place where it's stored In aluminum canisters
As a middle child, I humbly bow to our king, Eugene.
Okay, tell me I’m wrong but  Eugene = Samantha Keith = Charlotte Ned = Carrie Zach = Miranda
"We're never doing this again." "Unless it does really well..."  *#6 on trending*
We need more keith and eugene!
wtf eugene i was wondering wth u’re until cheeseburger and i realized you’re just saying gibberish u did me dirty
Dang, they didnt do breakfast burritos lol
The background music gave me a headache. I  couldn't finish the video. (Stopped at 22:50). I don't know if it was too loud or too distracting in contrast to their speaking but either way I feel like it shouldn't stand out that much. I enjoyed the content otherwise.
Who else googled what a Bradford Pear tree smelled like to know what they’re saying?
I didn't know this was the crossover I NEEDED
More collabs, please!
🔥
This was so chaotic I loved it!
MORE RANK KING
Keith: "Welcome to eat the me-" Eugene: "This is cum. Everything is cum."
Eugene, I am a fellow southern, and I HATE ranch as well. Eugene is right, Kieth is wrong, shut up.
I don’t go to McDonald’s for a freshly cracked anything. I know I’m getting processed liquid egg and that’s okay because it’s not real food and it isn’t supposed to be. It’s McDonald’s.
Really tired of Keith plugging his sauces!
How many year's will your Mom live??  Ignore : 0 Year's 1 Subscribe = 100 Years
Hawaii McDonalds Menu…you have to get the apple pie here as it’s deep fried.  So.much.better!
Please more Rank the menu. Yall are so awesome together as a tag team.👍❤
You guys got the JUNIOR chicken, NOT the McChicken!! that's why it was sucky!
If you are low on funds get the mc double with big mac sauce. A co-worker recommended this, its good Lol !!!
The keith-eugene combo is my favorite humor wise tbh
I was slightly offended the McChicken was ranked so low, but then I remembered the McChicken in Canada is different than the McChicken in the States and, yeah, the States McChicken sucks.
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖
Its actually the bone not the bowie lol
You guys need to do a Burger King! The spicy chicKING sandwich is 💣🔥
We need a Rank the Menu with Whataburger so that Eugene can tell Keith how he's wrong.  Redemption for Whataburger!
This was great! I love the Eugeith. Keugene? vibes. Okay, but hear me out... high Rank the Menu.
I feel like Eugene respects Keith more now hahahaha.  I need more of this. Keiths acceptance of the death feeling and Eugene learning of the pain hahaha.
Yes more Rank the Menu, loved the Keith Eugene crossover 💙
I NEED MORE EUGENE AND KEITH!! This was *chef's kiss*
Its been a while since their videos made me laugh as much as this one
I used to work at McDonald's in the late 90s and the pies were baked at that point. I looked up when they switched and it just made me feel old. They stopped frying them 30 years ago. There were quite a few other changes to the pie more recently. They used to have a cinnamon/sugar topping on the crust that is now just a sugar sprinkle.
This was amazing. Them both…I laughed so much. I needed this. Adore you both 🖤
There are two moments that stand out and will be going to heaven. 1. When Keith tried to suck the spoon in the Mcflurry 2. When Keith silently started gagging on the McNugget Pancake
33:18 Keith looks like he could just cry. 😆
DO THIS AGAIN PLEASE
the icons
not eugene referencing my favorite snl sketch-
I love McGriddles. 😭 they are my go-to McDonald’s breakfast sandwich. However, I do not eat it often. So I think the rating is fair for the most part. Loved the video!
I love that their shirts match the pillows
Love kieth experiencing all 5 stages of grief with those mcnugget cakes with ranch. just *chefs kiss*
This was an awesome pairing! Would love to see more
Imagine not including the Sausage & Egg McMuffin
I couldnt stop laughing this whole video but I also had the epiphany multiple times that Im more Keith than Eugene mcgriddles, catholic filet o fishes, and ranch all day
I need an answer of where McDonald's Sprite ranks tho. That's a whole different type of Sprite right there
rank the menu rank the menu
“Don’t recommend channel” wack AF
Please please please do more of these crossovers with Keith and Eugene! They're my absolute favorite! This was so funny and entertaining.
Oh yeah, the US McDonald's don't have the McSpicy, why is that? I thought the US go crazy with everything chicken?
The chicken nuggets are amazing so glad they got the number one spot
Vivo por el Keugene
wait what. mcchicken is $1USD ? Its 5.49CAD in Canada. what is this. 1900 . $1 for a burger??? 1 USD =1.25 cad approx
Y'all need to do another one of these. I'm just saying.
Happy to watch another upload :)
i need more rank the menus and i will not take no for an answer
Witnessing someone else other than Keith getting a fast food grease high
Am I the only one McLoving the red and yellow color scheme? And the elegant pillow selection and placement?? Very high class for a fast food review mashup/cross over boys, well done! 👏🏻
Just saying, the McGriddle is easily #1. I don’t care what anyone says 😂
The hate on the McGriddle is wild man.
fun fact - the filet-o-fish only has half a slice of cheese because when first introduced, it was considered part of the "healthy" items. That half slice be saving us from diabetes apparently.
omg omg omg om gomgomgmgomgomgomgogmgmo YASSSSS <3 More please MOREEE of these <3
this duo is iconic. hands down. also, this made me want to eat mcdonalds now and i swore to not eat fastfood on the weekend but oh well
This one of two fun facts I know about McDonald's drinks. The coke is a special formula made just the golden arches. It has more of a bite so it tastes better as the ice melts. The ice they use in their drinks is proprietary it is a specific shape and size for them as well. It takes longer to melt and therefore your drink does not get diluted as much.  You're welcome. Now someone else will know those useless facts.  The fries are friend in beef fat. They use to be at least.
This has been the most iconic video since the one where Eugene and Kelsey went through all 50 states' iconic alcoholic drinks.
I used to always get the strawberry sundae. But they don't have the strawberry sauce anymore. At least in Canada.
Useless fact: the university in my town planted those trees all over campus. Spring is a bad time.
The Filet O' Fish is my favorite McDonald's sandwich. Regarding the regular chicken sandwich, add pickles and cheese.
Go vegan!
🤣 I love how gradually delirious they become in this video
In Canada the American mcchicken is our jr mcchicken and then we have a bigger non spicy chicken burger called the mcchicken. Also we have mcchicken sauce which is mayo but with a touch of mustard…it is superior in every way to mayo 🤤
LINDEN TREES! It's linden trees that smell like manly... emissions. Also persimmon fruit tastes JUST like it. Like, exactly like it.
Why didn’t you guys just share each thing?
America must have different hotcakes to Australia 🤔 Ours are the bomb
The entire video summarized: Eugene - I'm right, you're wrong! Keith - If I'm being frank ... * proceeds to hate the item *  LOL we need more of this!!! Please keep it going for next time!
We need more of this!!
My name isn't Sarah N. Dipitous but it is Seren, and my friends sometimes call me serendipity! Or Dippy cuz theyre assholes lmao.
strawberry sundae is better than the hot fudge 🥺
"We are never doing this again" "Not unless this does really well"  Oops  Sorry not sorry, I want more Rank the Menu!
Marvel: Endgame is the most ambitious crossover ever  Try guys: hold my beer
The last few times I got a Big Mac the employees didn't put enough sauce on it.
I really love Keith and Eugene together in videos! They have such a great dynamic.
More "Rank the menu" is a must 😁🙏🏽🙏🏽
You can't get a McGriddle in Canada. The one time I had it in the US I thought it was what dreams were made of.
Keith is Samantha Eugene is Charlotte Ned is Miranda Zach is Carrie
More Rank The Menu!!
Did they improve the egg, I can see the yolk? They always used cracked eggs for their McMuffin sandwiches. Oh the ignorance.
I'm so happy I got the "could it be beef?" reference
Can we have more of these? Please
I miss the nuts for the sundaes 🥺
I fucking love McGriddle patties, I worked at McDonald's for 10 years and before we went all day breakfast, every time it hit lunch I would save myself some of the left over McGriddle patties after they were marked as waste (because otherwise they would be thrown away) and that would be my lunch later on when I went on lunch. It was sad, I was also kind of poor at the time. Currently my favorite food at McDonald's are the Sausage McMuffins. Which are usually $1 or a little bit more and you get sausage, cheese, and butter on a English muffin. It's so good and so cheap.
the subtitle's kinda off
I love this
Who's the creepy shadow dude in the back @15:53? Lol. And they didn't have the McDouble. Is it better or the same as the Double Cheeseburger?
This is the content we want and we need
Don't like the new look Keith really high and it bothers me
You gotta get the mcgriddle sub round egg (the real eggs).  Takes it to another level.
As someone who worked at a McDonald’s for a few months, the hotcakes honestly became my favorite thing on the menu
I still want to see a sushi eat the menu
When you find out these a difference between whole eggs and "liquid eggs".....hello service industry!
I love this collab idea!!!
we need more of these
I'm halfway through and if they've forgotten the buttermilk chicken sandwhich I'll be UPSET. only thing worth eating after the wraps. RIP
Idk if it's just a Canada thing, but the Chicken Mcgriddle is both the best breakfast item and the best chicken item (besides nuggets)
how is the fish not the worse... it shouldn't even be on the menu
More Keith and Eugene collabs!!!!
Keith and Eugene videos are always amazing
But I love Filet O Fish and McGriddles so much 😭😭
Okay now im sad, i always get a couple hamburgers
Keith has to be high
I feel like Jonathon has a wealth of knowledge. He often just drops facts or answers questions so quickly… he needs to go on jeopardy!
Is he saying c*m trees or p*say tress I am so confused
Wow
Ugh I didn’t know how much I needed this
McDonald’s is vegan guys Woahhhhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need more of this series! Just absolutely perfect duo 😎🤙🏽
Rank McDonald's Food after You Look Up FBI Report, Human Meat Found in McDonald's Meat. 90% Tested Came Back Positive
MOAR RANK THE MENUS!
yes I'd love more of this!!
they match the pillows
The fries, Big Mac, and hash browns are all better than the nuggets
the fact that Keith's mustache is now normal to me and I hate that
the hot cakes are one of my guilty pleasure foods so I was upset, but then you both liked the hash browns so I was less upset.
Touch grass and get mickeyDs
Where's the hot n spicy? How dare you!
Too bad they got rid of the steak eeg and cheese biscuit and the buttermilk chicken sandwich cause Greyson were the freakin best
Justice for hotcakes! They’re the only breakfast item I’ll get from McDonald’s. 👏🏻🤣
This was so much fun! Not to like, ask you both to put your health and well-being in jeopardy again, but I would absolutely not say no to another Rank the Menu episode honestly 😅😄
Yes! Loved it! Still chuckling.
It’s so nice seeing Eugene happy! And Keith not sooo food sick! Omg this is #6 on trending!!!
Keith: Introduces food name Eugene: *simlish *
might be the only one, but i feel the need to defend the hotcakes...they slap
eugene is so unhinged in this video LMAO
I honestly enjoyed the heck out of this!  A bit of a miss to get a standard Egg McMuffin instead of a Sausage Egg McMuffin...but you can be forgiven this one time.  I vote do it again!
Please make more of these, this was the best moment of my week. Which is saying a lot, since we had puppies at work today.
Absolutely incredible format, 10/10
Okay but when are you guys gonna do Hot Ones...👀
I like the hot cakes with butter and syrup! I also like to get a sausage biscuit fold the hash brown and put it on the biscuit with ketchup! Love a Big Mac!! Nuggets are good too! When I was younger I used to get a double cheeseburger and a packet or thousand island dressing and put it on top! It’s before I knew about Mac sauce!
I love Keith and Eugene's friendship! Also love the union of eat the menu and ranking the menu.
Eugene saying each item name completely wrong killed me everytime 😂 more keugene ! 😂
Watching while eating McDonald's
I had my first McGriddle back in 2016 on vacation in LA and I still think about it after all this time 🤤
The fact that Keith’s McFlurry wasn’t even blended…
MORE
My chickens are only a dollar there. ????? MBN😭I pay over 2 dollars in cali
Mcgriddles were done so dirty. Can't believe the disrespect.
This was utter hilarity and I loved every bite of it~ 💛😂
lol I love a sausage mcgriddle idk why they hate it so much
Rank the menu needs to be a series
You are missing out on the McRoyal Bacon Burger. It's the best thing ever. Come to Portugal ;)
This was amazing. Rank the Menu is a fun idea, honestly.
You know who else orders hot cakes at macca’s? Vegetarians.
I'm sorry guys, but I reeaaally lolved this cross-over and I want to see it again!!
Back in the 80's when I worked at McDonald's, they used lard. Like that solid oily white stuff.... Huge vats of Crisco, but not Crisco.
Yes rank more menus. Yes justice for mcgriddle.
Loved this combo so much! Please do more of this! XD
Please make this a weekly installment!
I'm loving Rank the Menu!!  More please.
I used to only get McGriddles for breakfast growing up, then I started to notice they coated my entire mouth with a film of greasy filth that lasted all the way through lunch 🤮Haven't touched them in years
Wait, so Keith's sauce comes from Keith?
That was super fun. Definitely do this again! You two are hilarious.
Whatever happened to "I'm right, you're wrong, shut up"?
This video is hilarious!  I just wish the captions were in sync with the video.  It throws me off when watching 😞
Yes please, more Rank the Menu!!!
JUSTICE FOR MCGRIDDLES
Growing up my favorite breakfast was the cinnamon roll. Now it's the McGriddle w/a hashbrown & sweet tea.  Also growing up when I had a surgery,which was a lot, when I was given the go ahead to eat solid foods my grandparents would bring me a quarter pounder with cheese.  Also the Fillet O Fish is, was and will always be trash.  I hated it as a kid and I still do now.  I remember in 8th grade we had a major field trip. Our teacher had it all planned out. Then she got sick and for whatever reason the sub scraped those plans. I came up with the new ones. We went to the Louisville Slugger Museum and the Louisville Science Museum. But the I did not plan the meal which ended up being McDonald's. We went on a Friday during Lent. Did I mention this was a Catholic school? Guess what EVERYONE had to order?!??!! FILLET O FISH!!!!!
This crossover more often!!!
I feel so vindicated that mcnuggies won in a landslide 💕
12:40 "They'd trick Becky with that for sure " 😆😆😆
love it, wanna see more please
I love the fish sandwich
How come the breakfast burritos didn’t make it as part of this ranking? 😣
Am I crazy or was the hot fudge actual hot fudge when we were kids? Now it tastes like the chocolate sauce they use in the squirt bottles at coffee shops or the grocery store one in the jar. Is it just me?
This was great! Keith and Eugene are the best together! And I'm so happy nugs were #1!
I work at Turano Knead Dough in Illinois, we make the McDonald's buns.
“When I’m drunk, I want a rotisserie chicken.” Keith, SAME. I want to gnaw on the bones like a Neanderthal. 😂
Please please more of this!!
you guys need to review national fast food chains in australia because i swear on my life our food is so much better and way less fat and sugary. please !
Keith's ranch sauce incoming??‽?
In Canada, we have a Jr. Chicken, which is the value menu item, then a McChicken, which is just a bigger one. Then the special deluxe ones lmao
YOu should have used the mustard sauce instead of ranch. Mustard is good on pancakes and chicken nuggies!
They forgot the oatmeal from mcdonalds
After years, decades even, of watching food reviews I’ve never understood the flavor of what the host eating more than “it’s like walking into an AMC movie theater”.
I went to order a seperate hashbrown the other day and it cost $3.10 🙄
I miss the cinnamon melts from McDonalds
So, I take it Keith has forgiven Eugene for getting his wife drunk on cheap wine before noon?
Please do this again! 🤣
I cried every time the mcgriddle went down the line. Best hangover cure ever
That was totally fun, seeing Keith and Eugene do this together.  I think I would have had the chicken hotcake taco with syrup, tho.  Thanks, that was great!
JUSTICE FOR THE MCGRIDDLES
Unfortunately, we all loved this format so......time for another remake of old times eat the menu
Us mcchicken is called chicken junior in Canada. And Canada’s mcchicken is just regular chicken sandwich on the menu
BUT…. No biscuits and gravy????? That’s my favorite McD’s breakfast item
Ranch is NASTY
this is McGriddle slander and I'm not here for it. lol also c'mon checkers/rallys fries are far superior.
“It eats like a Yankee Candle if I’m being honest. It’s soooo goooood!” 🤣 How that can be a compliment is beyond me!
McGriddle was the first thing I ate when I visited America and I hated it so much it’s an abomination
they really did the hot cakes dirty. With butter, syrup, and strawberry jam it's honestly so good
The way they both start to get delirious while eating...it makes this video just so delicious! They are a great pair, more Keith and Eugene PLEASE!
I love this so much, would definitely love to see more Rank the Menu videos
The amount of censored words was annoying haha. Y’all should have a channel that includes everything that is said, then a PG channel. I think the explicit channel would be FUCKING hilarious.
I WANT MORE OF THESE CROSSOVERS PLEASE
Eugene: Lemme get a number 2 with some Mac sauce
I agree with Rank King on the McGriddle. I can’t do a breakfast sandwich drenched in syrup, it’s just not right, way too sweet. And also everyone saying they’re dressed like ketchup and mustard, they’re wearing MCDONALDS colors sillies 😂
Justice for Hotcakes!
Nooooo not the Big Mac being ranked higher than the Quarter Pounder with cheese! :( Also, the Big Mac is Trump's favorite....just sayin
We want MORE OF THIS!!
@27:48….. 😂🤣😂🥲🤣🤣…. Best ever!!!
If u put cheese on the mcchicken it makes it stupidly better!!
the collab we needed
please subtitle your videos try guys! the auto ones are very bad and miss lots of things you guys have lots of hard of hearing viewers❤️❤️
they are high aren't they? this is just an excuse for their munchies
I love Eugene videos that don't involve blood🥹
Bravo!
I like to put strawberrie jelly on my breakfast sandwich s
this is really good....more of this....wow i really missed Eugene and how funny he is with everyone else XD  sorry Eugene 500k in just a few hours.....sorry Eugene, you are doing this again XD
I get the McGriddle with just sausage or cheese and sausage. The egg is sussy. They also make a chicken McGriddle and I frickin LOVEEEE ITTTT
Maybe this is something Keith has mentioned before that I missed but is there a reason he's eating the burgers sesame seed side down?
they need to do this but australian maccas
I looooooove mcchickens. I get them every time
In Canada, the McGriddles now come with the good egg!! Just ask for it my friends down South! That's what I did before 🤗 Also, the reason why the Coke tastes better from Mcds is because the syrup come in stainless steel kegs, not plastic lol
You’re right, I’m wrong… OPEN WIDE!!!  Rank the Menu ❤️❤️❤️
CHALLENGE TO EVERYONE - Watch this video twice! Let's get the numbers up so they'll do more content like this!
We need more rank the menu!! Love you’ll!!!
I love Rank the Menu! More please! How they got more food drunk as the video progressed was hilarious.
Fucking loved this!!
They flirt with each other and it’s wonderful to watch.
It cracks me up how the farther they go one the seemingly drunk or stoned it seems they get off of fast food lol 😂 poor Keith
It genuinely makes me so happy and proud when try guys videos are trending. Y’all are just so honestly kind and have made me laugh through so many hard times and I always feel like a proud mom when I see you continue to succeed. Thank you for being beautiful, unproblematic YouTubers <3
McDonald's fries have always tasted good, even when they changed the fry oil to all vegetable oil. However don't put them in the microwave! I did once, before I knew how microwaves worked, and my God, did I stink up the break room! Oil poured out of them, turning them into odiferous, greasy noodles. The smell lasted for days,. When Keith mentioned that the burger tasted better than it used to, I thought YES! It's true! I used to hate the quarter pounder, but now it's not bad at all.
No Mocha or Caramel Frappe 😔
This was sssuuuuchhh a good crossover!  More please!!
Eugene would make a fantastic Batman villain 🤣
Will watch as many of these as y’all are willing to make 10x over
As a former McDonald’s employee the spoon in the McFlurry is actually used to stir the toppings in. It attaches to the stir machine and spins the actual spoon hence the shape to fit around the metal piece
More more more!
Vril must be collectivized
I'm rewatching this just to try and get more views so that they do this again
Wish you all could come to Japan and try the "Adult Cream Pie" (basically a fried custard pie)
It's okay to be White stop the great replacement today
How dare you disrespect the McGriddle. It’s so awful that it actually loops back around and is good. Scientists from around the world have gifted us this unnatural sandwich. For shame Try Guys. For shame.
mcgriddles should be 1 no debate
It's ok to be White
They were half wrong. While Eugene IS the Samantha, Keith is the Miranda, Ned es the Carrie and Zack y the Charlotte.
I'm really fucking drunk, and I'm eating a McDonald's burger now, this was just peak entertainment to me.  I fucking love you Keith and Eugene
CROSSOVER😭💕 I would genuinely go to prison for swinging over a McGrittle, McNuggets, a Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and a McFlurry!!!!!!!!
Keith and Eugene should do the wendys menu together!! Im really wanting to know what their thoughts are on some of the items especially the spicy chicken sandwhich😁😁
Another Rank the Menu please!
Definitely more rank the menus
Love the Collab, and especially the new Rank King closing line "Open Wide!"
This was exactly the crossover content I didn't know I needed until I saw it!
We don't have the McGriddle in Australia. Never have I been more inclined to try one so I have an opinion
McDonald's baked apple pies suck compared to the fried ones. Glad we still get them here in Hawaii
mcchickens are so good
We still get fried apple pies in Guam and Saipan 🇬🇺🇲🇵
Another rank the menu please! Thoroughly entertaining!!
they had the pear trees near my friends house and oh my god they were PUNGENT
you guys should eat and rank all the different girl scout cookies since its girl scout cookie season!!
No test
The differences in their bites are so funny
heeeeeey, mcgriddle stan here!  The Mcgriddle got me through college (for the third time) and I'm soon to be a practicing ota.  I know what you're thinking, and of course I got cheese on it.  As for why I am like this?  The world...may never know.
I would swap the cakes and the nuggets
the best thing mcdonald's has ever had on the menu is pepper fries
If McGriddles aren’t #1 this list is void
After the “Keith and Eugene expose toxic masculinity” video, they became one my favourite Try Guys pairing, so I love this 😂
@16:16 oh gawd noooooo. Fries are the best eevvvveeeeeeeerrrrrr! 😄
this reminds me of the try guys drunk fast food test.  it has a similar energy.  i wonder if they “indulged” in something before filming this?  anyone?
OMG an ICONIC video!! Honestly I was waiting patiently for this one :)
This is what women want you to act like. Patriarchy is bad, but Matriarchy is also bad. Don't accept either.
FINALLY A CROSSOVER
I'm here for Eugene 💖
I like this idea, Eugene ranks the food after Keith eats it, like consecutive videos
Love Keith and Eugene ❤️☺️
Please more of this.
my exact thoughts after getting the crispy chicken sandwich at mcdonald’s was also that i should’ve gone to popeyes LMAOO
MORE RANK THE MENU
mcdonald’s warm v cold is night and day! can’t commit to these judgements
The first McDonalds location, and the original when Ray Kroc joined, is in San Bernardino, California.  The oldest surviving franchised location is in Downey.
I want to see 20 rank the menus
The other video in the before times in the before place is my favorite video of the Try Guys♡♡♡ I know it by heart word for word 🥰 sorry but it's true. I really love that video and Keith DID eat an Oreo McFlurry in that video maybe he don't remember  Love you guys!!!
Guys, neither of these shows individually is my favorite, but the COMBO is pretty dang solid. Eugene, we've missed you. So funny together (Ned & Zach, you're funny too, obvs), much funnier than bringing in your guest stars on your "individual" shows. Plenty of laughs.
The move is a mcflurry and chocolate chip cookies.
Eugene's Kristen Wiig/Maya Rudolph "beef" impression 🤣 One of my favourite SNL sketches
the collab i have been waiting for 😩✋🏻
I am a mcgriddler
Do more of the “Rank the menu”. Wife and I love them. DO MORE!
The chemistry between Eugene and Keith is my fav. 🙌🏾
this is officially my favorite video now wlsmkamww
Oh great Eugene and Keith please rank hot sauce 🙏🌶🥵🔥❤
MORE RANK THE MENU PLS
this is some of my favourite content you guys put out im sorry you die in the process but it just brings out the silliness i love about you all ❤️❤️
I am a hot cake stan (it's better than all the sandwiches) and I think McDonald's nuggs are the worst fast food nuggs so I can't say I love this ranking. Everything in the middle is on point though.
NGL, every other week, I use the McD app to get the free medium fries with minimum $1 order.
Caramel fudge sundaes for McDonald's are the best you can have both sausage together it's special thing at I ask
I just came to comment that I like that y’all are dressed like ketchup and mustard  🍔 that’s all 🤎
I took that hotcake slander personally
Alright this has to do really well we need more!!!
Has Eugene gotten even more attractive or have I just not seen him in so long that I’m amazed all over again?
this show is the perfect thing to watch while stoned
When keith said he'd always get a mc'double and mc'chicken when he was younger i was hoping he was gonna say he put them together to make a mc'gangbang
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whosoever should believe in Him would not perish but have everlasting life John 3 16 🙂 💙 ❤ ♥
Watching two kings looking funky fresh is a great start to my Sunday
** sings** When Eugene was a young warthog!!! Loved the lion king reference
Did you even try putting butter and syrup on the hotcakes? They are so good. Throw in the sausage and it's great.
This is chaotic good 😂. Or chaotic evil idk 😂 but I love it.
This made my heart happy 😃
Every episode with sandwiches has at least one “This is pretty dry,” and one “That’s a WET sandwich!”  It’s like Keith has a “Goldilocks zone” for sandwich moisture.  😂
Gosh the background music is so distracting from the actual content
I loved the dynamics of kieth and Eugene in this video. Does anyone else miss the McDonald's king sized wraps?
They messed up cause now Im going to want more of this crossover when possible
they wasnt pupets you four eyed geek they was real!!!
28:48 your not supposed to be able  to taste it, it's supposed to be so hot you burn your taste buds off, thats the point of a McDonald's apple pie.
This definitely needs to happen again!
i'm so offended by the McGriddle placement; unacceptable
The mcgriddle is my favourite thing on the McDonald's menu and I wouldn't even object to it being the bottom of the list tbh. It's deliciously disgusting
Ik
We need more of this crossover!
But *because* they bake the apple pie it is vegan. Everything fried at McDonalds isn’t vegan so baked is better at least for vegans.
okay this was a gem. seeing the two of them interact so casually was perfection. need moreee
“Good” news for Eugene, if chickens eat raw egg they do develop a taste for it and start destroying their eggs, but people also will feed them scrambled eggs and eggshells cause it’s a good source of protein and calcium lol
What I wouldn't do to sit down and have a meal with these two- their personalities compliment each other so freaking well. Great vid!
Sarah Anne Dipitous is my new drag name
Ever since McDonald's changed their nuggets I've hated them. They removed their artificial flavors or some shit and now taste horrible.
I lost it at “when I was a young .. WARTHOGGG!!” 😂 MORE OF KEITH AND EUGENE PLS
Justice for the McGriddle 😭
Please rank lunchables
DEFINITELY DO MORE OF THESE
McDonald's eggs fun fact...the round eggs are cooked at the restaurant fresh. The scrambled egg squares are shipped in frozen and reheated by steaming them.
just realize they’re dressed as ketchup and mustard 😂
The set was extra visually appealing with Keith and Eugene matching the cushions. Well done!
Listen -- I'm a McGriddler. I love it. It's the best of ALL breakfast items to include pancakes and eggs and [insert breakfast meat].
He did not put the filet-o-fish above the mcgriddle! The mcgriddle is definitely in my top 5 lol
i love their matching colors for mcdonald’s
The McGriddle is literally the ONLY thing I will eat at McDonald’s.
It's a double quarter pounder because it's 2 quarter pounder patties. Not 1 half pound patty.
Talking about SATC x The Try Guys: I know, everyone considers themselves a Samantha but I don't think that Eugene has a distinctly Samantha-like persona on camera. INSTEAD...  Eugene: Miranda (used to be bad-ass, stern and sometimes cynical but softens over the years) Keith: Carrie (often led by emotions) Zach: Charlotte (juvenile, optimistic, if a bit naive) Ned: Samantha (if you're disregarding his relationship status which is very unlike Samantha, he's also the oldest of the bunch and sometimes speaks in a very sultry way)
Psst. I'm with u on the ranch dressing, Eugene. I don't hate it, but its soooo overutilized.
Oh boy haha McDonalds food in the US is the worst, which is hilarious considering its where it is from. The bread/bun isn't much better, but it is definitely better outside the US. I agree chicken nuggets, fries and hash browns are the best items on the McDonalds menu.
I love the mcgriddles Eugene!! 😂😂😂
Ranking the spicy chicken sandwich this low is SACRILEGIOUS!!!
We need more of this!
A "bawk" if you will 😂
Did they purposely dress up as ketchup and mustard
the sims language 🤣
I can totally relate, the McGriddle is just too much and tastes like nothing but chemicals. Also, very strange that the iconic Sausage McMuffin (with or without egg) was not part of this as it is arguably one of my top items to order. In Filet-o-fish's defense, it is ONLY good when you eat it fresh because the bun is steamed and immediately loses integrity as it gets cold,  akin to the fries - eating it cold just doesn't do it justice.
*sigh* we're gonna need more of this, fam!
Do this again for the love of McNuggets
Fries will always be #1…
I worked at a McDonalds in the 80s and haven't stepped foot in one except to use the bathroom since the years started with a 1. More power to you, it just doesn't scan as food to me anymore. I don't think they have a single menu item I'm able to eat, even if I wanted to.
The double quarter pounder as #1 and Fry's when hot #2
WENDYS RANK THE MENU WITH THE NEW FRIES!!!
This was incredible PLEASE do another Eugene Keith crossover
This is the combination we NEEDED…….. more pls
I have missed Eugene.
Could it be beef? I’m sorry, the answer was nine? Ah, Eugene is an old school SNL fan I see.
The greatest birthday present ever oml
Someone *please* tell me what the word they’re bleeping is, I’m so confused
The sausage McGriddle is so much better than the egg and bacon one.  Have Eugene try that one and he'll get it.  It's just like chicken and waffles, you get the salty and the sweet.
The cross over we need
love
eugene speaking gibberish when introducing the items is so funny
Y'all need to do this for Wendy's!
Missed an opportunity call this ‘Eieth the Menu’
I love how Eugene some how makes everything dirty even when he isn’t trying. I know he does it on purpose but it amuses me when it’s not.  I enjoy the energy of Keith and Eugene.
love the red n yellow matching
Guys that ham is *absolutely not* Canadian bacon 😅
That final crossover would have been better with pancake syrup rather than ranch.
I’d love to see this format with Starbucks!!
If they tell you the machine is "broken" but you are still able to order a sundae.... the machine is not broken, there just isn't a staff member capable of (or willing to) make a cone.   xoxo - an ex- McDonald's employee
Bruh the hotcakes are the best things at McDonalds, I’m heartbroken 😭
Oh my God I’m literally terrified of the stupid McDonald’s clown
I am a “McGriddler” and I am very upset it isn’t like 3rd place
When you find this video while eating McDonald’s so now you have to watch it while eating McDonald’s
I tend to forget McDonald's is really just a burger joint and not known for their chicken. MCDo Philippines is know for the chicken. Hahahahaha
My midwestern soul hurts over Eugene’s ranch comments
The little matching ketchup and mustard outfits and pillows are killing me! 😂 it’s so adorable!
the crossover i didn't know i needed
Keith gagging and then taking another bite of that hotcake-nugget-ranch taco…was a moment
The fact that their shirts match the pillows is amazing 😌
"IN THE BEFORE TIMES AT THE BEFORE PLACE" crying
My husband and I love this collaboration!  Eugene speaking gibberish, Keith trying to keep it on track, loved the jokes and the chaotic energy these 2 have together
I never knew I needed a Keith/Eugene combo this much?? it’s amazing
Great now I want McDonald’s
Wait. America still has plastic straws?! We have soggy cardboard ones now 🙃
YES more rank the menue please
The hamburger… I pull off the bottom bun and fold it in half. Vastly improves the beef-to-bun ratio.
I'm from Tennessee too.🙂
The last shape of the chicken nugget is the oval
We need another mash up!!! Loving Rank the Menu!!!! And also - I agree with Keith. McGriddles are wicked.
Love seeing Eugene and Keith together, would definitely watch them ranking more menus.
More of whatever this is!
MORE PLEASE. THIS IS ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE.
i too am a mcgriddler
Eugene needs to rank rappers next.
I don’t understand the hash browns popularity, I find them gross
Eugene, I'm from the North Star State as a opposed to the The Lone star state and as a midwesterner I am also traumatized by ranch
Sorry Eugene but Chris Klemens is the king of Middle Children 💀
Keith + Eugene is my favorite one on one of the try guys
Rank the Menu sushi next? I really liked this collab! Short and sweet menu, sometimes eat the menu drags on, but I love this pacing. It felt almost more focused? Yes.
More rank the menu!
I feel like Panera would be a fun one to do as their menu has some variety and not super geasy!
Eugene determined to say cum and promote various television shows for 34 minutes
Get the McGriddle and ask for the round egg
That was a super fun video! You guys need to collab more!
guys please please pleaseeeeee do five guys. Keith needs to try the fries cause 👀 also if you do, you gotta eat in the store cause thats part of the experience. anyway pls do five guys
Oooooh... I like this idea a lot actually
Here's a secret about that ice cream machine: they tear up all the damn time. However, especially late at night, if we've already cleaned the machine, ya it's broken. Not recleaning that damn thing at all.
i love a keugene moment!!!!!
i feel like theres a point where keith gets drunk off of all the food and in this instance its 28:32
I need a rank king and eat the menu collab just ranking the ranch dressing from each fast food chain IMMEDIATELY
love seeing keith and eugene together they bring the chaos and its awesome
This was fun!
Congrats, #6 on trending guys! Well deserved, you two are amazing together.
Weird mcgriddles and biscuits egg mc muffin  All have the fresh cracked eggs in canada. Wonder why in the states they use the scamble mixture bottle for mc griddle and biscuit.
Bacon mcgriddle 🔥
THEY’RE HERE! Love this duo WAYYY too much!!! 😂😘🏳️‍🌈
Eating McDonald's while watching this... they forgot to put cheese on my Big Mac ☹
i really love the Keith/Eugene dynamic. 10/10 *chefs kiss*
Excellent!!!!😁💕😁💕😁💕😁💕
I stan keugene💪🏼 this was perfection to watch hungover in bed 😂 love y’all! Couldn’t stop laughing!!
i havent had mcnuggets in a literal decade wow
they should have ranked the sauces, i would pay to see that.
I want McDonalds so bad now
Did you guys… coordinate shirts with the pillows?
Rank fast food burgers Big Mac vs whopper vs 5guys
Fries are actually beef. Lol. It has beef flavoring.
Dude McDonalds is just baadd....
Is this sponsored by yellowjackets
McDonald’s fries taste good because beef flavoring is added to the oil.
Idk why i feel like the chicken just got worsed, cuz i swear the macchicken was so much better then it is now
When the say it's broken they are just cleaning it out
Idk why i feel like the chicken just got worsed, cuz i swear the macchicken was so much better then it is now
The gender neutral word for King/Queen should be Eugene
YES THE CROSSOVER OF MY DREAMS
I need a food science internship. Mfrs halp me ass
Keith is absolutely cheddar blasted during this episode 💨
I missed Eugene
I'm Sarah Ann... Wasn't blessed with dipidious 😑 (my moms name is Sharon😂)
you CAN get tomato and lettuce on the double quarter pounder. YOur order person needs to do a better job
Absolutely loved this!! Great combo of both and loved the ranking. More please!! 🙌🏻
Canadian bacon is just cured back bacon,  the meat comes off the back of a pig.  You should try A&W if you ever come to Canada, there are restaurant locations in the USA, but they're not as good as in Canada.
Not the double...
USE THE ARROW BUTTON TO SKIP BAD JOKES.
The hashbrowns are just under $3 a piece where I am. It is crazy town.
Keith + Eugene is such perfect chaotic energy
mcGriddle is best thing on entire menu
This entire video is just proof that Keith and Eugene each make anything better, and as a pair they hold far too much power.
Oh my godddd. I just realized Americans don’t have smartie McFlurry!! That’s the best!
Just throwing this out. There is a how it's made episode out there for mcgriddles. Its pretty cool to watch. Theres no injecting it's more like they ball up the syrup then bake it into the griddle cakes. I love them sans the egg cause just no.
I LOVE KEUGENE CONTENT ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like mcgriddles, but I think you would have had to have to start eating them as a kid because they are not food a normal adult would seek out or like I think cuz they aren't good but they are
There are two different types of stoners...
I feel like they just got h1gh and wanted to eat McDonalds. And honestly, good for them.
The best burger McDonalds ever had was the  McDLT !!!
Haven't had the apple pie in years, but had to run to check. Still fried in the UK, thank god!
Wait how the hell are the god tier pancakes at the bottom but the nasty soggy with oil hash browns are at the third spot?!
my list is better
i strongly believe a BACON egg and cheese mcgriddle would have changed their minds
The difference between bite sizes for the two of them is kind of comical.
I have a secret (but like not so secret) love for McDonald’s and I love the rank king/ eat the menu videos. This was just the absolute perfect video.
Sad they didn’t get to try the spicy chicken McGriddle. It’s a different chicken patty and would probably blow Keith’s mind
Keith was giving me Jenna Marbles vibes in this video, like Virgo season Jenna.
Do this again!!!!!
This was really great and I've love to see it again. As for the conflicting rankings, I suggest doing what Eugene has done on previous Rank videos: Let the "guest judge" (Keith) make the initial rankings, and then Eugene can rearrange everything when he "closes ranks".
How high are Eugene & Keith rn?! I haven’t laughed this hard since their high video.
Surving PEOPLE!
The fact that Eugene even mentioned injera warms my Ethiopian heart, but sir, it's pronounced more like if you said injure and add an a at the end. I am just saying. Still love you!! <3 ...Also, I'm biased, but I think injera is softer and better texture than a mickey d's hotcake...I also don't think injera goes well with syrup
WE NEED THIS SERIES TO CONTINUE!!!!
I'm so sorry guys but this is gonna do *great*  😂😂😂 Next time take Eugene to a beer garden or smth and yall can "drank the menu" instead 🍻
1.	  Egg McMuffin and Sausage Egg McMuffin are two separate sandwiches.   2.	 Folded eggs are sus. Always sub round eggs  3.	 McGriddles straight out of the oven are god tier. If you have seven minutes to wait, ask for fresh McGriddles.  4.	 I thought that too but actually it's the offensively bad syrup. Try it with the strawberry preserves instead.   5.	 No comment. I don't like them but lots of people do.  6.	 McDonald's goes through so much Coke that the syrup isn't kept in bags. There are 75 gallon tanks in the back.  7.	 McDonald's fries are iconic.  8.	 Always order your Filet o' Fish fresh. It takes three minutes. The cheese was decided by the test kitchen in Illinois.   9.	 Add tomatoes and/or pickles to the McChicken. You're welcome.  10. The "new" Crispy Chicken sandwich is a redux of the Southern Style Chicken sandwich. The Buttermilk Crispy Chicken was better. 11. The Spicy Pepper sauce is a lot if you don't like being attacked by your food. 12. McNuggets are a classic.  13. Hamburgers/Cheeseburgers are comfort food. The taste is nostalgia. 14. Double Cheeseburgers and McDoubles are essentially the same sandwich. The only difference is the amount of cheese. 15. Quarter Pounder with Cheese is the best lunch/dinner sandwich.  16. Double Quarter Pounder is too much beef. 17. See 13. 18. Big Macs will always be there when you're having a bad day. There's onions, pickles, and wheat in the sauce (fyi). 19. There was a settlement recently that should allow McDonald's stores to service their own ice cream machines instead of calling in a tech from the manufacturer.  20. The apple pie was recently changed and the new apple pie is markedly better. Switching from frying the pie to baking happened before Obama took office. You can still get fried apple pie in the South. The Peaches and Cream pie, while objectively the worst baked pie, is the best fried pie. 21. If you enjoy chomping on frozen chunks of chocolate go off on the M&M McFlurry, I guess. McDonald's needs to bring in a standard menu, not limited time offer, non-chocolate option for the McFlurries.
This was such a great collaboration video!!
The nuggets are lowkey BAD with no sauce
I'm a McGriddler and I'm Proud
McGriddles are my fave after the fries
"I like the pope's outfits. They're suuuuper gay." -Eugene
Eugene has become slowly more unhinged and happier in the best way possible since coming out
The spoon is shaped that way so they can hook it up to their machine and use it to stir up the mcflurry
didnt realise the right side was the worst end until like quarter way hahahaha wow i am dumb
I like the McGriddle 🥲
I didn’t even watch and already love it.
BEST COLLABBBB!!!
Where's the Sausage Egg McMuffin????,
My favorite duo! The chaotic energy from these two 🤌🏼. 💜💜💜
This was amazing!
⚡baby people⚡
🍟🍔🥤
This is everything
YAY KEITH AND EUGENE
Always get the round eggs, they crack eggs for those.
Great crossover. Nuggets are the best. I used to like the quarter pounder too, but last time I had it, it was changed and was awful and was like cardboard
I'm in america for the first time in a fair few years. Wanted to watch some Try Guys stuff as I haven't in a while and they're the main american thing I watch on youtube. When I saw this video I was like - yes, perfect - and it made me smile and laugh so much. Thank you very much. Made my day a lot better.
Those compilations of Keith and Eugene being gay: insert this entire video
Eugene and Keith are such different people there’s no way this didn’t turn out iconically hilarious and it did so… thanks
This was magic! I want more!
I love Rank King. I love Eat The Menu. I love Rank The Menu. Maximum Try Guys please and thank you. 🖤
This was excellent. *chefs kiss*. The crossover we didn’t deserve, but the crossover we all needed.
Always substitute the folded egg for round. Round egg is fresher made. Folded egg comes premaid and basically heated on the grill. (At least at the store I worked)
Honestly hilarious video. Would love to see more rank the menus 😆😆
You should eat the menu while stoned!
Mcdonalds used to have a breakfast beagle, they no longer serve it…or at least not in texas. I’ve been sad since then.
i will not stand for this mcgriddle slander Eugene🙄
About calling it the double quarter pounder.. it's crazy the psychology of marketing. I think it was McDonald's that changed the quarter pounder to a third pounder for the same price, but sales plummeted. Because people thought it was less meat, because 3 is smaller than 4. The fact that the majority of people buying this stuff were so bad at fractions blows my mind.
I would LOVE to see a rank king episode of seltzers. It seems like everyone and their momma has a version of alcoholic seltzers now.
I fully believe that what makes chicken nuggets so good is that they scratch such a unique taste itch that nothing else quite does. Like, they aren't particularly tasty, but they just REALLY hit the spot
Please do this with more restaurants, you killed this
We’ve been asking and it finally happened!!
Wasn’t expecting the last part
the color balance with the pillows in the back 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rank the menu is the iconic cross over I didn't know I needed
Eugene's feelings about ranch is how I as a Marylander feel about old bay
What happened to the breakfast burrito??
The repartee between these two is an absolute pleasure to watch
"We are never doing this again" "Not unless this does really well" Is #5 on trending 6 hours after release
Can you do a rank the menu of fast food french fries
Excellent combo
I always got the Filet O Fish with extra tartare and would then put the fries inside the burger...... Dipping french fries in the sundae....Or the thickshake.... Double quarter pounders are the bomb.... You have some items that we do not have in Australia....So I have no clue what they are like....
McDonald’s did me wrong before the pandemic they had the bagel sandwich now a days they don’t have it lol if I’m the only one that remembers this I’m all good with that 😂.
Oof...McGriddle was way too low and all the Crispy Chicken sandwiches way too high
the buttermilk crispy chicken was better, i will forever grieve the day it was discontinued
My fav middle school memory was sneaking in dollar-menu McDonald's food into the movie theater
I think my fave Try Guys duo is Keith and Eugene
Aaay you number 5 on trending congrats!
Its NUMBER 6 on TRENDING! Lol they better do this collab again 😭
The Chi'King Deluxe at Burger King is THE BEST fast food chicken sandwhich I've ever had. It's actually real, thick, crispy chicken. It has no business being that good from a fast food drive through restaurant.
27:28 Emily Zugay
As a former McDonald's employee, I resent the lack of Sausage Egg McMuffin here. It's by far the best menu item
PAROLE
Suasage egg Mcgriddle is the best no doubt
McFlurries in the UK are half that size and it's so depressing.
Eugene you are so right about Ranch sauce/dressing. It is vile.
As a mcgriddle stan i am quite frankly offended and think it deserves AT LEAST middle</3
They changed the recipe of the chicken nuggets tho!!!!!!! How did y’all not notice!!?!
The McGriddle is a dream for a hangover. Also, the SPICY McChicken slaps, I’m sad they don’t have it everywhere anymore. Also also, my regular order is a filet-o-fish. That tartar sauce is magical. But agreed, nuggies are top tier.
Just letting people know that the apple pies in Hawaii are still deep fried.
This is the boost of serotonin we all need for a January day ❤️
Ok but yellowjackets is amazing everyone watch it
McDonald's soak their fries in water and corn syrup for 4 days before they fry them and because they're so small they end up soaking up all that sugar, making them sweet and salty!
Number 5 on trending? Let’s goooo
As an Eritrean, hearing Eugene describe the hotcakes as “injera-like” when most people (wrongly) describe injera as a pancake made me feel like I’ve been transported to mother dimension
The Bradford Pear smells like semen.
McGriddler here or a mcgriddle stan if you will. McGriddles are my fave depression meal and deserve to be #1
beautiful 🤣
More rank the menu!
In my opinion the McGriddle is good if you are someone who really likes sweet things and overly sweet things and your mouth and stomach can handle that stuff. As someone who's favorite breakfast food item from McDonald's the McGriddle sandwiche, specifically the sausage one
Cant tell if this is a commercial for Yellowjackets or a commercial for cum
Fully convinced this was filmed after high trivia.
the only thing I've learned from the ranking videos is that I have terrible taste x'D
Rank the menu was great! More Eugeith pls
I need more of the dynamic duo. Hilarious. And I am very torn between the McGriddle and the Sausage McMuffin.
The chicken mcgriddle is singlehandedly the best thing McDonald's has ever created. I'm sad Eugene hated the mcgriddle😂
One of the best Try Guys videos I've seen in months! Eat the menu is my fave segment and Eugene is always fun to see! Please do more!!!
This was great but I definitely believe the Mcflurry deserves top 3
I used to get fillet o fish all the time when I worked at mcdonalds.  I would add leaf lettuce and tomato.  I think it's an underrated fast food sandwich not that it's fantastic or anything, but better than most fast food.
at least in my part of canada, we always call it peameal bacon not canadian bacon
Definitely do more of these!
I want more of this!
I wished they ranked the nugget dipping sauces
I feel so bad for all of the states that don't have hot and spicy chickens
WE. DEMAND. MORE. EPISODES.
good
Love Eugene deeply but that comment about the mcgriddle being so bad for you that you should only eat that all day is very toxic to ppl with eating disorders and probably even to himself 5:04 btw
Rank Baskin Robins flavours
Commenting because I need this video to do well so we can see more of this glory!
More of this please
the DISRESPECT put onto the sausage egg & cheese Mcgriddle is TOO MUCH SIR!
Filet o fish so underrated
their teeth are so white😮
Im sorry guys but this is so good.... Rank the Menu has to be a thing!
Oh how I’ve missed the Rank King!!!! The thought of syrup, pancakes, sausage, egg and cheese together is vile. I once ordered a McGriddle with the pancake part and just the sausage. Delicious.
I need to say this for Eugene- get the biscuit sandwich and ask to sub the folded egg with a round egg- the round egg is what they call the egg from the McMuffin- you can do that with any of the sandwiches- and I do lol 😂
McGriddles always seem like a good idea to me but I always regret it
When they got rid of the butterfinger mcflurry there was no longer a reason to go to mcdonalds and that's facts.
This was absolutely hilarious - please do this for all of the Eat The Menu episodes!   I like how Keith goes out of his way to say something good about Whataburger after he got so much grief for tearing them to shreds in the ETM Episode! 😂🤪  Random McDonald’s breakfast fun facts I noticed upon watching the video… 1. You can get the “real egg” on any breakfast sandwich - so much better! 2. The McGriddle is made by mixing maple syrup crystals into the batter that melt into little syrup pockets in the finished product!  Keith does this all the time - I hope Eugene is OK! 😱😂🤪
The way that they are dressed like ketchup and mustard and the pillows behind them are too is so iconic. Love the attention to detail.
yall are my favorite combo also yes chicken nuggies #1 for sure
what the pancake chicken taco needed was some chicken sauce and maple syrup
The issue with the mcnuggets is that depending on the time and location they're such hit or miss. Usually they're too fried and you can't taste nor see the meat. They have lost the nostalgic appeal to me. The fries, cheese burger and sundae have the most nostalgia for me personally.
WHY DID YOU USE RANCH INSTEAD OF SYRUP?!?!
I totally want another Rank the Menu
Just wanna say, I think the timing off the subtitles is off :/ Super fun video otherwise!
JUSTICE FOR THE MC GRIDDLE!!
Thank you for the comments on Catholics I am an ex catholic and it was so funny
I really like when the guys just to get together and laugh.
Always get the nuggets :) They are the best.
I don't know where Keith is getting a Hash brown for a dollar cause here in San Diego it's one for like 3.59 and it's BULLSHIT!!!
So small but my family and I have said that mcds pancakes feel like Injera so this slight representation made me feel so seen haha🥰🇪🇷
We need more rank the menus
You guys forgot the sausage breakfast burrito!!
Lets blow this up to get another ranking with a new fast food take
the "megg mcmurmu" and Keith saying "what?" got me omg we need more keugene lol
You guys should do more of these!
Go back to the restaurant Eugene wanted to be there for. Rank the whole menu together.
Hi I am a judge fan from Mexico, you should try to rank Mexican food or candy’s from Mexico
I want more Rank The Menu pleaaaaase
This is the chaotic good i crave. Eugene and Keith always bring out the best in each other. 🥰
Let’s rank the menu! 😁😁💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I absolutely loved this
this was absolute the best thing ever
More
This needs to happen again!
this was excellent
They should rank food when high lol
Eugene's simlish was on point.
You lost me at the McGriddle. Best McDonalds item. Period.
Hashbrowns are such a rip off here in Australia. They're $2.50.. they used to be $1, then $2, soon they will probably be $3
I'm so mad the mcChicken is so low 😭 it's the only fast food meat I still crave as a vegetarian
I really loved this. More rank the menues!   I useually dont watch eat the menues unless i like the restraunt since by half way in Kieth is delerious and mostly burps. But this added alot more of that try guy banter that i love. Definitely watch agian.
Omg what a combo
I was never a fan of Big Macs but after having the real thing at one of the last surviving Bob's Big Boys, I don't think I could ever eat one ever again. Also had the vegan version at Doomie's in Hollywood. Couldn't finish it, it was soooo rich.
It's crazy our generation was learning 2/4=1/4 in 6th grade and now as a teacher I am teaching my fourth graders how to convert 1/10 to hundredths so they can add it to 56/100.
I work at AMC, unfortunately there’s a nuggie shortage and near impossible to find vendors. After not selling chicken since beginning of covid we finally got the IMPOSSIBLE NUGGETS! They taste pretty good.
Brilliant crossover series! (sorry Eugene it’s DEFINITELY got to be a series! )
McGriddles are seriously the best breakfast sandwich you can buy. What a stupid review.
Love this crossover and hope to see more!
Why haven't I seen any comments talking about how GOOD Eugene's singing was at 20:28??
I hadn't had Micky Ds in SO long and you guys made me get my classic order! Quarter P with fries! Yumm and I became a McGriddle stan so I'm with Keith all the way, it deserved to be higher! Great vid guys!! 👌🏻 🍔🍟🤪
more More MOre MORe MORE
Keep it.
I hope you get a Showtime sponsorship with all these free plugs lololol
DO THIS AGAAAAAINNNN <3
One of the funniest videos. Truly iconic
I don’t usually comment but this was an amazing crossover!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I worked at McDonald's for 2 years and the highlight of opening every morning was pouring that hot fudge out. It smelled like brownies and it was GODLY. Nothing better at 4am than smelling brownies.   Also you GOTTA do the quarter pounder deluxe. The only way to go.   And you can sub the eggs out - get a round egg on everything, it will change your life. I know that wasn't this video but for the future, get round eggs. They're top tier.  *Also adding: If/when they bring Resses cup pieces back for mcflurries - get an oreo mcflurry and add reeses to it. Chefs kiss
watching this while eating mcdonald’s is just perfect 😂❤️
I'm literally wearing my scuffed shoes that I should throw out rn 😆
WHY ARE AMERICAN MCFLURRIES SO BIG WTF
i got the hotcakes when i worked at McDo by pure curiosity and that was the first time i wanted my money back for food.
Keith and Eugene truly brings the best out of each other
The McGriddle is the best when you switch it to a round egg… top notch!
Was Eugene saying the name of each food in Korean? Anyone know?
Breakfast = Sausage McGriddle (no egg) and add cheese and a hashbrown with a large iced caramel coffee.  Lunch/Dinner = Spicy Chicken sandwich with extra pickles and add cheese OR a Double Cheeseburger, extra pickles, and add mac sauce.  Also, the Hot Mustard sauce is the ultimate superior Nugget sauce and the world was a darker place when it was discontinued for a while.
As a Canadian, I’m disturbed by the look of that Canadian bacon. It almost looked like bologna to me.
THIS CROSSOVER WAS EVERYTHING WE NEEDED
Keith is my favorite try guy and I really love him with Eugene. It's my favorite combo.
Fun fact: The round eggs are real, whole eggs cracked into a mold. The square eggs are made from liquid egg product.
havent had mcdz in over 10 years but the big mac and chicken nuggets were top tier
rate **ms.
Shame you didn't use the slogan "I'm Right, You're Keith, shut up and eat"
Definitely needs to do well. 😀
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
Big Mac sucks... 1000 dressing is awful and that extra bread in the middle is wrong
Hahaha I love when you two crack jokes haha we need more videos pleaseeee
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh what a treat!!!
When they bleep things I can never figure out what it is they’re bleeping and it irritates me
The McGriddle is good w just sausage, no egg or cheese
Moar Keith and Eugene
Dang at this point the US need a poutine restaurant
I hereby think that we should all dethrone Eugene as the rank king after this one I respected his rankings in the past videos but not on this 1🤣
fast food reviews that don't eat half the item need to start with a qualifier.  big mac unravels halfway through, fries lose like 2 letter grades during a car ride.  love the channel.
To anyone that reads this: go add fries and ketchup to your mcchicken 😩
I love Keith and Eugene’s energy together. We need more collabs for sure!!!!!!
We need more crossovers!!
I love McGriddles so much lol  .
Try guys need to try a McDouble made like a Mac 😎🤤 way cheaper then a big mac and with 1 less bun. Also a double quarter pounder BLT is a thing guys 🇨🇦😁
This is the crossover we never knew we needed. Good job guys
The energy is immaculate throughout the entire video
keith and eugene: “oh let’s say our ship name”  my brain: eueith (yeeth)  them: “keugene”  me: obviously that’s what i was thinking
I love this dynamic so much hahahaha
I ordered a McDelivery while watching this
Mcchicken slander 😔😔
Does anyone notice that the try guys use a lot of music used in Horrible Histories? Like at 6:14 it's the music that plays when there's an animated bit like when they talk about what Vikings had on their helmets and 23:12 it's the "Hi, I'm a shouty man" music. Am I alone in this? British people? 😂
This is a comment to help the video do well.
My daughters name is Saren because of the word Serendipity. Close enough 😂
More of this please
YESSS WE LOVE A CROSSOVER VID!!!
it,s ironic to put fries in the "not beef" category since they have beef in it lol
Please do this AGAIN
losing my shit over keith and eugene taking turns just saying gibberish instead of the product names
I also like “Eugeith”.
More rank the menu
Rank the menu helps Keith eat less. but make Eugene, somehow eat like Keith 😅
I don’t want y’all to hate doing it but you should definitely rank the menu again!
like does keith have  alifetime supply around the office or is that bad boy kept in his pocket?
I love how droopy Keith’s eyes get toward the end of Eat the Menu.
The mcgriddle is my fav  here in Canada. The way I eat this is adding the has brown to the mcgrille
just wanted to tell yall that I just noticed I'm not subscribed, I'm sure I'm subbed, they removed me, might be happening to others too
RANK KING!!!
Me, Sara Ann sitting here eating popcorn chicken with Keith’s chicken sauce like 👀
McDonald’s actually works with coke to create a special formula for the drink just used at their locations.
double 1/4lb add lettuce and mac sauce
Love this so much 😄
We need another Becky and Eugene rank video
I agree with Eugene on everything except I would switch the big Mac and nuggets. I tried the mcgriddle once after my dad raved about it and I was so mad I tried it. I do like sausage with syrup but something about the combination of the sandwich just doesn't work for me.
MORE RANK THE MENU
Yaaaaas!! At last!
I can’t handle the Keith and Eugene duo, Topic Masculinity, aka the 70s themed talk show by men and for me, almost killed me
Definitely more rank the menu!
I do love the various competitions and contests the guys have, but this was really refreshing. Two of the guys, hanging out, enjoying each other's company and opinions...and trying not to die of food poisoning. What could be more wholesome? Really enjoyed this!
More please
Y’all better do this again
More. I just realized. Keith and Eugene are my favorite try guys. Their lovers also hold that spot.
I LOVED THIS VIDEO! you should *for SURE* do this again, but fast food things against each other (ex. best fries, best burger)
Do a rank the menu with sushi.
Keith and Eugene: The Mustard and Ketchup of Try Guys
The rank kings
I know we aren’t allowed to speak the B word, but thank God for B******d bringing Eugene, Keith, Ned and Zach together. The combination is supreme.
I didn't know how much I wanted Eugene anf Keith together in a video until I saw this!!! We need more of this!!!
Yes! More of these! I couldn't stop laughing.
Omg “in the before time, at the before place” I love that lol
PLEAAAAASE DO THIS AGAIN! I love Rank the Menu! 100% perfect Try Guys content. Love seeing Eugene so happy, too!
Keith you knocked it out of the park with your sauces! We have gone through a couple bottles of each!
I'd the bacon smoked house burger was in the menus permanently,  it would beat everything also mcgriddle is the best one and chicken Nugget are gross cause I can test chemicals in it
I think Eugene helped balance out some of the likes and dislikes. My favorites were still in the middle but 🤷‍♀️
My husband and I dig on the McGriddle. It's especially delicious with both a sausage and chicken patty.   Canada has a slightly different menu (we have a delightful Angus burger on our menu) but we think the McGrid should be #7.
The only thing is there’s no chance a mcchicken is better than the crispy chicken sandwich.
Love you guys
Mcgriddle is my favorite thing on the menu
I’m so sorry, but we are definitely going to need more of these videos! This was iconic! I loved every second!❤️
I personally need Keith and Eugene to rank *every* menu
A&W apple pies are still the good ones.
wonder why they got two of everything instead of just sharing one food item
Literally in line at McDonald's watching this video lol
If they rated McDonalds in Australia the ranking would be soo different
It's making me sick just watching them eat all that McDonald's.
Love the mustard/ketchup vibes from your shirts
Keith Im with you, I love mcgriddles
Eugene mispronouncing and mumbling something funny instead of the actual name of the food cracked me up every time 😂😂😂
This is the correct ranking 😌
Wait, the Eat The Menu McDonalds was when you were at BF? I could have sworn you did it on this channel.
Lol Keith and I have the same Scrooge McDonalds order XD
Biscuit over muffin … the numbers say so
Y'all have to invest in some type of way to keep the food warm until it's time to eat it, man. The temp messes with the quality, you have to eat a lot of these foods hot to actually get the full scope of their value! C'mon now, it's been years LOL warm it up!
I love this ketchup and mustard colour story
I love how they matched their outfits and the pillows in the background to the McDonalds Logo
Love this crossover of Rank the Menu!!
i’m a mcgriddler
loved you two together :)
guys i want dinner what should i order
This was awesome! We need more
I’m happy with whatever puts Eugene back in videos. I miss him.
This video gave me a soul deep craving for McNuggets like I have never known before
This was fantastic
Chicken nuggets taste like calf fries lol so it makes me wonder what are chicken nuggets lol
PSA: everyone needs to get a quarter pounder with Mac sauce
Did you say a McChicken is 1$ there??? Its just about 6$ in Canada for just the burger
Hashbrowns are top tier cmonn
Hilarious 😂 i would totally watch another RTM
Firstly: why no sausage and egg McMuffin with cheese. Best item on the menu hands down. Secondly: where the hell is everyone else? Thirdly: I feel like you've done a version of this video a hundred times. Y'all better be working on something huge! Stop phoning it in guys!
PLS more of Keith and Eugene together. This. Is. GOLD.
Eugene and Keith make a great combo.
I loved it! I miss seeing you Eugene. And I love Keith's eat the menu and ranked so with the two together I'll be watching and waiting for more!
More rank the menue!
Any one else just absolutely love goofy Eugene!?
questioning Eugenes taste buds since he put the Mcchicken above the McGriddle.... wtf!?!?
The chicken nuggets from McDonald's are disgusting and tasteless. Jail, immediately, lol.
Does anyone else remember the Big N Tasty?🥺 it was kinda like the Quarter Pounder but with lettuce and tomatoes.
Ugh. I absolutely *hate* that I have opinions on McDonald’s food strong enough that I feel the need to comment on this video about them. Buuut… here we are _and_ here we go!! (lol)  First of all, I agree that the Sausage, Egg, & Cheese McGriddles are fucking _nasty._ *However* if you get one _without_ the egg and cheese (So… just a Sausage McGriddle!) they’re absolute *FIRE!* (Provided the fact that you’re into sweet & savory/salty combination items!)  And now for my second item which actually isn’t featured in the video at all. I’m assuming that’s because, for some weird reason, it isn’t _on_ the menu anywhere, even though they _always_ have it. I also need to preface this item by saying that they’ve changed it some within the past couple of years and is now nowhere _near_ as delectable as it once was. Now that I’ve chatted it up so much, be prepared to be let down by the reveal, because the item I’m referring to is their Fruit & Maple Oatmeal. (lol) Now, the yummy maple oatmeal aspect hasn’t changed at all, so it’s as good as ever! Unfortunately though, they ruined it by switching up the fruit “mix-ins” thar come with it. Previously it came with one pouch of regular and golden raisins as well as one pouch of sweet, slightly tart, and (somehow) hella crisp, chopped apples. Once the pouches of fruit are mixed in, the oatmeal becomes _truly_ incredible, as well as super filling! However, the last time I got the Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, instead of raisins, I got a packet of dried cranberries and, instead of chopped apples, I got precisely *jack shit.* lol  Welp, there’s the McDonald’s hill that I’m willing to die on. Apparently this is what my life has come to. Oh boy. 🤷🏻
Dip the fries (ask for them well done and salted) in a caramel sundae
I would have liked to see the nugget sauces ranked as well, or even in the overall list. Is BBQ better than the hash brown?
Real bacon Canadians  sooooo good ! 👍
The fuck happened to the real slogan. "I'm right, you're wrong, shut up!"  Also the censoring is stupid
It’s them talking about what tastes like c** throughout this episode for me 🤣
More Rank the Menu. Also, nothing beats a double fish filet except maybeeee the holiday pie.
eugene said the whole video smells like cuuum
I'm with eugene, ranch is gross. and it's super gross when it's poured all over food. blech. i think i'm traumatized from when a giant bag of it was spilled all over me
I missed these 2 together 🙏😭
The crossover I never knew I needed. Thanks guys. Brb, gotta go smash that like button so they make another one.
The video we never knew we needed but are so glad we got to enjoy anyway
More Rank The Menu!!!!@
their shirts match the pillows opposite of where they're sitting
WE NEED MORE RANK THE MENUS PLEASEEEE
I am a die-hard for the McGriddle, BUT the sausage-egg-cheese is doing way too much. I always go for just the sausage. It's very simple, like it reminds me of when I was a kid and my parents would take us to a local cafe for breakfast and I would sausage, pancakes, and hashbrowns, and I would dip my sausage into the pancake syrup. It's a pretty good breakfast sandwich, a little dry, but that just means you ask for extra syrup and pour it over, which is always a win bc McDonalds has really good maple syrup!
Rank the different chicken sandwhichs from different restraints!!
Need more Keith and Eugene crossover videos. I liked the Rank the menu, but more Keith Eugene crossovers in general
1. A food warmer would be a tax write off guys.. 2. The mcgriddle being so low hurts me
did anyone figure out what they were bleeping lol
Please, Please, Please do another Rank the menu! This was fun!
MORE OF THESE TWO!!
the female ginko tree is also super stinky
Keith, Becky is going to beat 80% of your ass implying she would be tricked by the fact that 3/4 of your ass should be kicked for making fun of her math skills. Sucks to be you lol
Can you please do Din Tai Fung and give us the REAL tea if it's good or not
More rank king!
I ate three McGriddles in one day before :D
They planted those trees all over my college campus and every spring it REEKS
Every time Keith and Eugene name an item I just keep picturing them going, "Tryboo. Tryboooo. Tryboo!"
both! you two are my favorites!!
As a former mcdonalds employee: The folded egg that comes on the mcgriddle and biscuit sandwiches is frozen and then thawed in restaurant. The mcmuffin round eggs are cracked fresh and cooked shortly before assembly of the sandwich.  Always substitute the round egg instead of folded. It makes them 10x better.
The world needs more Rank the Menu.
Pls do this again
"I'm Eugene Yang the famous internet Catholic!" - Eugene Yang (the famous internet Catholic) 2022
YESSSSSS!!! Rank the menu as a regular series!!!!
Personally love the spicy deluxe chicken sandwich over the regular one, has lettuce and tomatoes too, the basic one is boring and you for sure need the sauce on the spicy one! And  McD's fries #1 all the way, what other reason do people even eat McD's??? I once got a delivery and they forgot the fries and it was the worst thing ever.
If only they still had their chicken tenders or the wraps for the rank the menu—def would’ve been higher than filet o fish 😂
Ironically I was shown a tree removal service commercial at the end of the video…. 💦🌳
What did we do to deserve this!! 😍😍😍😍 Please please please in the love of what ever doesn't offend you make it a regular series and would bet my life on that!! I miss the regular version on Try Guys Game time with 4 of you together as it is!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm such a simp for Keugene 😂
Omg I’ve been waiting for you guys to bring the tank king back!
Nuggets being #1 is acceptable!  Lol
I don’t know why but Keiths face says  “I’m gonna be a daddy”
wtf keith. mcmuffin = ham. it's the only good use of ham on earth.
As a former Catholic, I can guarantee absolutely no one asked for the filet of fish. Lent is depressing enough without weird fish sandwiches with half a piece of cheese
Keith: Says the item name Eugene: also says it, but in Simlish
This gave me a stomach ache just watching.did I get sympathy diahreea ?
You can request the style of eggs you want on any sandwich. The "round egg" is the only style that is a fresh egg cooked in store
Long term Mcgriddler here. Just wanna say that i found this video to be extremely offensive.
The best mcdonald's sandwich was the chicken mcgriddle. I will die on this hill.
What is with the half a slice of cheese in the Fish Filet? Canada has a full slice, probably because we have universal healthcare so we throw caution to the wind and go for all the cheese.
kids: ❌ baby people: ✅
Eugene is Rank King Keith is Rank Prince
Zach is Miranda (single so long) Eugine is Samantha (so much sex talk), Ned is so Charlotte (do I need to explain?) and Keith is Carrie (going back to eating dairy, when he is lactoseintolerent is like Carrie going back to mr. Big)
This format is 100% where it is at. I never leave comments but we need more of this.
My two favorite. One is the best. The other is the worst.
They didn't do mc cafe
Anyone else get a Taco Bell ad? They’re on to us..
But home style burger.
Mine would be fries, mcnuggets, hashbrown, strawberry creme pie, big mac..frappe
I hope this does really well
I used to looovvee a good ol McGriddle. But now that I’m an adult, it’s incredibly overwhelming.
McDonald's apple pies are still fried in Australia!! So good 😋😋
This is the video series I've been waiting for. It only makes sense to rank the menu!
Do all the restaurants!!! I love this!!! You guys are amazing together! Love it 😍
Is Eugene speaking Simlish? 😂
McGriddle is the # 1
For breakfast always get the round egg!! Those are made fresh and cooked the square egg comes frozen and is warmed up !!!
I missed Eugene
Damn now i want fries. Stuck in quarantine but this made my day 100x better :)
I loved this combo
I need more of these two ranking😂
Singapore’s top selling item from Macs is McSpicy. and paired with Ice Milo, perfection! McSpicy is really spicy, really juicy deep fried boneless thigh. i don’t think it’s the same as US spicy chicken sandwich.
I'm a mcgriddler through and through and everything Keith said about it was absolutely true. We KNOW it's bad but its so good. It's more than a meal, it's an EXPERIENCE😤
Where’s the hot and spicy?!
So maybe they should imitate Popeyes with how their chicken sandwiches are made (bun, sauce, pickles), only with like six chicken nuggets inside?
You should do a taco bell video!
The fillet of fish is really good.
Keugene sounds like you are romantically shipping Keith and Eugene together. I’m not complaining
Love that their attire is McDonald’s colors! So glad Eugene is back and combo with Kevin. Love him.
I love seeing Eugene and Keith be food drunk together 🤣🤣
If I had to ‘f***, marry, kill’ the tryguys, I would select Kieth for each one. In that order.
NGL whenever i do get a filet o fish I always get it with lettuce. Eugene is right
32:54 wow the grease buzz… almost like they’re McDrunk.
My bf changed my life when he told me, I can get the Mac sauce added onto any other sandwich.
I love you guys doing eat the menu together 🙂
As someone who works at McDonald’s- can get this food for free on a regular basis and also knows how all this food is made- adds a whole extra level to watching this video
But where was the chicken mcgriddle ?
Now I want this video to do super well!
why is eugene talking in sims language when they introduce the food?
please do this again! i love the balance of energy in this one
The mcgriddle is the only breakfast sandwich I like. 😂 Otherwise I just get a breakfast burrito.
I love this whole crossover
Nothing at McDs is good, except the Sprite
I love this... I kinda want them to rank Fast Food Breakfast items next.
What a treat to watch 🥰💖
Add Big Mac sauce to any burger - The best ever!!!
Wow the apple pies here in canada are still 2/$1 and look nothing like these. Wild.
Crossover of the century.
I thought this episode was sponsored by Yellow Jackets and Showtime🤣
Tmw they both realize they have the same show (Eat the Menu and Rank King). 🤣 We stan opinionated men that know what they want!
Sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is a top 3 menu item, 🚫🧢
Here for the hot n spicy
Keith eat the hot cake taco at the looks like he’s dying 🤣🤣
A lot of injera bread at like, local, "unfancy" Ethiopian restaurants is made with pancake mix! It's a hack that I guess permeated the culture in Africa, and now is a carryover to a lot of "cheap" (not cheap as in not tasty!! Cheap as in not expensive and """classy"") Ethiopian food you can get in the US!
Dear America,          Please stop calling a slice of uncooked mf'ing ham 'Canadian bacon' its not.. no seriously its not.. there is Canadian bacon, and that shit is delicious.  It's a wet-cured un-smoked back bacon from trimmed lean boneless pork loin rolled in cornmeal.  Thank you, All of... most of.. someone from Ontario
Lil fact, the McFlurry spoon is designed to attach to the mixing machine hence the hollow center and that lil plastic clip on the end. Keeps them from having to clean a mixer over and over.
My go to here in Canada is the quarter pounder BLT
We need more Of the try guys high WITH SNACKS😍
should have tried the breakfast burrito those are my fave! also justice for mcChickens those are amazing
I don't know when it happened, but McDonald's changed the oil it used for their fries. To me, they taste pretty bad now.  You youngsters don't know what you missed.
gotta disagree with y'all- I love that hotcake breakfast combo. Hotcakes, sausage, and the hashbrown y'all. Then again, it brings me back to washing The Price is Right as a kid on Saturday mornings, so maybe there's some nostalgia bias there 😂
Definitely wish the McGriddle was ranked higher. When I'm craving something that's salty AND sweet, that's nothing better from McDonald's!!
The mcgriddle is the best I love it so much
In NZ we had a Bubblegum flavoured McFlurry and oh god the colour was so artificial it makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it
OMG Seeing Keith combine the pancakes and nuggets just reminds me of Ron Stoppable and his "Nacho" Lol
Only commenting so that this video gets more views
This is the most controversial video yet
we need five seasons of rank the menu…. keugene 4 ever!
Oh I Hope They Do More!!!! 😄✌️✨🍔🍟
These two are my favourite duo! I’m so glad we were blessed with this episode
who’s gonna tell keith the mcchicken is now 2.19 in california💀
The first 3 are literally the only thing i ever get from McDonald’s
This was a pretty weird ad for Yellowjackets 😆
please stop poisoning yourselves for clicks and views.
the machine isnt broken, they just cba to clean it
More rank the menu!
I can't explain why but my #1 would be double cheese burger because it's just so damn good and it's not the worst item/health wise then it's mcdonalds fries/poutine and then bigmac. We have local grocery store that sells mcdonalds type chicken nuggets u can make at home so I don't really buy nuggets from mcdonalds but they're amazing.
the best portmanteau of Eugene and Keith is Eugeith.
Takes an exquisite pallet to understand the culinary complexities of a McGriddle
I love Eugene and Keith together Their 70’s moment on toxic masculinity freaking gets me every time 😂
Eugene is right. Eugene is Samantha, Keith is Carrie, Zach is Miranda and Ned is Charlotte! And just like that… the try guys had sex in the city.
McGriddler here, I would love The Rank King crossovers with all the shows, Date Night, Candid Competition, The Barkchelor...
I never comment. I enjoyed this video so much I was pulled to the comments section to say MORE PLEASE! Love you both 💕
Lol so all you need for hot fudge sauce is chocolate and some sort of oil. Melt the chocolate and add a bit of oil (preferable vegetable oil but coconut works if you want more of a magic shell effect) and make sure to mix it well. Depending on how much oil you use will effect runniness.
Justice for McGriddles!
Big brain video idea: go to Texas and eat do one of these videos for whataburger
ma fav cuties <3
I'm a McDonald's employee, and my franchise offers it's employees free food for our breaks, so I am very familiar with all of these.  I agree, the Spicy Crispy Chicken is hands down my favorite thing on the menu, even over the Classic, which totally threw me, because I was a huge fan of the Southern Style years ago when we still had that.  The sausage egg and cheese McGriddle is what I eat when I get my break waaaaay early in a long shift, like I still have 7+ hours left, because I know it'll carry me through the rest of the day.  The hash brown is great; even though I eat it almost every day, it's still hard to say no to a free one.  The Quarter Pounder (with no cheese, because American cheese is the devil) is my favorite when my break falls during lunch/dinner hours. And we have fresh never frozen beef now, cooked when you order! We finally learned something! Somehow that makes a huge difference.  I still can't argue with people over the quality of our fries, and still go after them, even after I've had to clean out months old fries from our waste bucket that STILL looked new.  Also, you're welcome for that round egg on the McMuffin. It always cracks me up (see what I did there?) when people are like, "Oh, I don't know about that round egg, Jess, I don't know why it's yellow in the middle or why it's round, I always get the folded egg instead," and I'm like, "Yeah. It's round because we cook it inside a ring. We cook it with butter, and we crack a fresh egg into a ring. That's the yolk."
Also keugene kiss, alliteration because its wanted
The colour coordination in this is elite
This would be great as a new series!
please make more rank the menu im begging
I NEED 100 MORE OF THESE!
I went to that old video and holy shit keith looks so different
These boys did the McGriddle dirty
Love Keugene!!! You should do more videos together!!
I've been waiting for this
ya did my griddles and french fries wrong
Yaaaay Eugene and Keith are the best couple!!
The fact you sent to sodas but didn't mention they carry tropic berry Sprite is a sin. Its delicious and you can only get it there
I love the difference in Keith and Eugenes bites. Keiths is always comically large lol
Pls never do an eat the menu without Eugene ever again
Little Bottom Princess Bun!!! I guess that would be me!!!🤣😅
hold up mcchickens are supposed to be $1??? they're more than $2 here LMFAO
The pancakes are just frozen, reheated in the microwave, and then we dump eggs and whatever else onto the plate. You're honestly better off going to Walmart to buy a box. It'll be cheaper.
We need more rank the menu!!!
I particularly enjoyed watching Eugene fail to actually say the name of any dish along with Keith
Contrary to popular belief, the McDonalds cheeseburger is significantly tastier when eaten *ice cold*. Change my mind. Actually, don't waste your energy on me.
The nuggets were a fave UNTIL at 2 am on the way to Wildwood NJ, I got a FOOT with batter!!! 😜🤢🤮 I literally opened the car window on the highway and spit a chicken foot!! Sorry if anyone was by the car I could not deal with the foot!! 🦶🐓🦶
Their fries actually have beef flavoring in them so they SHOULD be in the beef category
I don't watch a lot.of try guys but have watched Keith eat mountains of food for years. This was good and should happen again.
They use the hole in the spoon to connect it to the machine and mix it
Please do more!
We need more Rank the Menu!
this video was everything I didn't know I needed. It was perfection! Rank the Menu needs to become a thing. I don't think I had ever seen Eugene eat something on camera before. I'm obsessed with this duo! I can't wait for the next one!
Hotcakes fans are malding
Euieth is better especially if you say it with the same inflection as "yeet" yeeth!
More rank the menu!!!!!😄
Hello, more please. 🙄🤡✋🏼👍👍🏽🤲🏼
Eugene and keith
The McGriddle got ROBBED!!!
My name is Sharon and my moms name is Sarah.
Wow they really do get drunk on fast food
LOVE THIS SM would adore seeing more. Keith n Eugene are so fun to watch together.
I had to pause the video and go rewatch Samantha's "funky spunk" clip. I'd forgotten about that! 😆😆😆
I think the fries and nuggies should be TOGETHER! Yay! both the best combo
Keith, while he was eating the best and worst, seemed like he was contemplating his life choices but also wondering if it worked flavorwise
Do a collab with Wes Tank! Maybe Keith could have a rap battle with him! (He was the guy that rapped Fox in Socks during quarantine and Keith was ranking the Top 50 Trending on YouTube. He's been wanting to say thank you for all your fans that came and checked that out)
oh LOVE the Kuegene content more of this pls 😭🙏🏻
I love Keith and Eugene together! Such a good dynamic ❤
as a mcgriddle stan, i appreciate keith defending the delicious masterpiece that is the mcgriddle. i definitely won’t deny the egg is weird as hell though
I hate Ranch!
Without seeing anything else…the hotcakes and sausage are best breakfast food…and the full plate..eggs, biscuit, hash brown, hotcakes and sausage is the BEST and the nuggets are just horrible! Barely tolerable unless coated in the dipping sauce.  Maybe because I wasn’t a happy meal kid, but they’re my “not really hungry, but not craving anything in particular” choice….normally my lunch/dinner is between Big Mac, no top bun, flipped top/middle bun so burger on burger or the quarter pounder w/cheese, extra onions….or if craving chicken…the mcchicken w/heavy mayo & a cheeseburger, one bite of each…and life is good….then just eat the fries dunked in their yummy tartar sauce or BBQ sauce
Apart from the big mac and mcflurry, I had always thought all these were the sad items at mcdo that only children and fools order... no big tasty, no spicy mcchicken (with lettuce), no cbo, no 280 original etc ? Where are the goodies?
PLEASE do another Rank the Menu episode. Keith and Eugene together is comedic gold FOR SURE!
Eugene!!! And Keith ♥️🎉♥️
I LOVED this video - please make more 😊😊😊😊
Product waste warning :D
Love the crossover happening here, but I am viscerally offended by how low Eugene ranked the McGriddle.
Eugene's description of the middle child so accurate, I felt that one being the middle child.
This is the first time seeing most of these McDonald's items for me and I'm genuinely like WTF AMERICA?? Fast food serves you EGGS?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Make another rank/eat the menu! Keith and Eugene is the best it’s the two of them together that makes magic! ❤️❤️🔥🔥😊😊
Yall try an egg mcmuffin but replace the english muffin with 2 hashbrowns. Accidentally discovered this glorious creation as a celiac
You two are heroes for eating all that...ugh.
Whaaaa? no BLT? thats sad. Guess its a canadian burger. Also sad that mcds no longer has the mcgridlle in mtl. Its my fav breakfast item. It should be top 5 easity!
MET GALA Eugene has out grown try guys, Idk his face and attitude sometimes just screams "wtf am I doing here anymore?" just saayiiing just saying maybe he need his own channel where he can do Eugene things of grandeur.....
I LOVE THIS!!!
Rank the menu is way better than each show individually
THE BONE ITS THE BONE NOT BOWTIE
Plz guys do A&W
Eugene and Keith need to eat the McChicken McGriddle. cleaner version of chicken and waffles. Eugene and Keith need to do more videos.
The bell, the ball, the boot, and the bone
I love the McGriddle. I order it with the egg on the side though
We need more of this
More Rank the Menus please!!!!!
The straw is shaped like that because they stick the top in the machine and it uses the straw to mix it. Usually anyway, sometimes they just throw it on top
i good example of that double quarter pounder thing is when burger king did a third pounder burger and nobody bought it because people thought it was less than the quarter pounder :’)
There is one other club sandwich style burger on the market though!! THE BIG KING from Burger King!
I remember going through a Canadian airport and getting a McGriddle. I was so disappointed. I would have been happy just getting potato. I should have just gotten potato.
Hehe I enjoyed Eugene’s nod to Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig “I think it could be beef”
Yes! More Rank the Menu... perfect Keugene combo!!!
In Canada the McChicken is a much bigger burger and its also quadruple the price. Our Jr Chicken is your McChicken lol
Was thinking today that what I missed was Eugene's rank king videos and now here we are with something even better.
I'm putting my vote in for more Keith/Eugene Rank the Menu episodes
A hot McChicken with pickles slaps idc idc
I only watched this because I wanted to see Keith and Eugene together. The food honestly made me nauseous. But I do want ice cream now
I tested positive for covid on Thursday and now I’ve just been waiting for Saturday for my emotional support guys to make me feel better I love yooooouuuuu❤️
the intros had me rolling
This was great! We need more Rank the Menu!
underated duo
The fact that they color coordinated their shirts with the pillows in the background to be Ketchup & Mustard?! Iconic ❤️💛
Also the McChickens in Canada are gross frozen food chicken burger patties, we had Jr chickens that was like mayo, lettuce, and like chicken breast that's the same price as mcdoubles
I LOVE this, please do more crossover episodes. Especially if you ever get to travel again and do local/regional place Rank the Menu :)
More Keith and Eugene video collabs!! #1 Big Mac
I'm now calling McDonald's chicken products "CLUCK CLUCK" lol
Was this filmed after Stoned Trivia 😂
Love them so much!!
I dunno how they eat McDonald’s cold. It’s just so different
McRoyal !!!
As a McGriddle Stan it deserves top 5
Oooo this was a fun one I like the ranking  videos.    And the eat the menu videos.  So the mix is great and fun.  Thank you guys
i liked mcgriddles as a kid but man they're just odd now.
As a McDonald’s employee it’s hard trying not to answer their questions about the food and I can’t answer them  Ugh
ohmygasshhhhh it's been awhile and what a cross over 🥳
if y'all want to have  fried apple (or taro or haupia or pineapple) pie from Mcds you gotta come to Hawaii. Jus' sayin'. WAY BETTER.
I’m aghast to see hardly anyone commenting on how impressive Eugene and keith singing that line at 20:30 is?!?  the mashup we didn’t know we needed
We got spicy nuggets in my country now - they’re so good, especially with the cheddar sauce
where are the curly fries????????????????????????????????????
this was beautiful. this is one of those videos you come back to when you need a laugh. i loved this. absolutely need more. but please like max top 15 things, i didn’t enjoy eugene feeling this awful through grease overload🥺 if not more eat the menu then just anything with these two together, eugene and keith’s jokes give me life💀💀
Im surprised it was a bacon egg and cheese and not a sausage egg and cheese. The bacon was the slowest moving item we had when I worked there and they have a really good sausage.
I stand by to this day that the best breakfast item at McDonald’s was the steak egg and cheese bagel with slivered onions. I have no clue if it was popular (probably not since it was discontinued) but it was soooo gooooddddd 😭
The timing of the subtitles are horrible :( as a non-native speaker its hsrd to understand without it)
Did you know that McDs fries are made with a salt/sugar mixture which makes them so addicting.
TRY GUYS, THIS IS THE SORT OF CONTENT WE WANT!!!!!!
From a McDonald’s employee I would like you to know the McFlurry “straw attachment” on the spoon is actually what attaches to the mixer
Keith needing a nap after eating McDonald's is a MOOD
the cross over we all needed
Would not have put McNuggets first...it goes French fries and then Big Mac, then Double Cheeseburger, then McToast, then McFlurry, then the rest doesn't matter 😆
Please do more of these! I immediately prefer this to eat the menu, not gonna lie. And I love the Keith/Eugene combo energy!
i am all about them chicken nuggets with ketchup, honey mustard, and ranch.
Eugene videos hit different
Definitely need more rank the menu
HOLDUP Americans can get Mcdonalds breakfast ALL DAY?!?
Yayyyyy
More rank the menu!!!!!!
"When I'm drunk, I want to eat a rotisserie chicken." - Keith     Very funny line, and how???
Canadian bacon isn't even Canadian. That's just ham
Mcchicken is good for the price lmao
Your ranking of the mcchicken is embarassing
You have never tasted a good fish sandwich until you experience Culver's
My go to order is mcchicken add mac sauce and pickles 🤌
Is this video sponsored by Yellow Jackets? Lol
You should do Eat Menu at Culver's!!!!!!! Also, apparently, the reason the third-pound burgers did not take off in the US was that Americans thought that quarter-pound burgers were bigger than third-pound burgers.
the background music is SO LOUD😂😂😂
The sausage mcgriddle with cheese (no egg) with the hash brown inside the sandwich is incredible. Also the sausage and cheese mcmuffin (also no egg, I don't like eggs) with the hash brown in the sandwich. I never liked fast food breakfast until I discovered these items.
20:28 eugenes singing debut?
I’d love to see many more rank the menu videos
Keith is extremely right about the second hash brown.
i need more rank the menu immediately
"or you know, go do something!" um excuse me who are you to speak to me like that
When you get a crazy budget can you do eat the menu around the world? Because there are subtle regional differences in the taste of a McDonalds burger from the US vs Canada vs France vs Sweden. Keep it in mind when you travel again. And maybe years later made this huge video of you trying it on different vacations. There is a difference between the taste of a royale with cheese vs a quarter pounder even though they are supposed to be the same. My take - France and the Netherlands have the best McDonalds because the raw ingredients they use there are just better.
How many people go buy the food Keith features after posting videos like this?? I’m weak lol.
This old chicken bacon ranch sandwich thing was so good. I hate the new chicken sandwich 😂
If you come to hawaii McDonald’s for breakfast we have spam, eggs, rice and Portuguese sausage. It’s called the breakfast deluxe platter.
this is me manifesting a new season of rank king some point in the future
McDonald’s stores their syrup in stainless steel instead of bags which makes the flavor better
Canadian McDonald's looks so much better than American McDonald's!
Always wonder what kinds they have in the U.S. We just got the homestyle chicken with kimchee, sweet/sour sauce and wasabi mayo it's so monstrously good.
Loving the Keith & Eugene pairing! I am not a big fan of the Golden Arches, BUT I agree with the Oreo McFlurry, Hash Browns & Fries being in the upper rankings. I'm also a fan of the Sausage McMuffin. I can't imagine what it feels like to eat all that McD in one sitting. I could see Eugene was feeling the grease load. Would love to see u 2 do another combo ETM and RK. I stead of fast food, what about a chain sit-down restaurant like Red Lobster, Chili's  etc.?
Keith & Eugene rank drunk food..drunk
If they decide to do this again, it would be fun to see Eugene rank what Keith thought was the best item of each of the Eat the Menus.
The horror on his face when Eugene figures out his grease laugh...
I don't know if I like the actual hot cakes, I just really like the syrup.
this was honestly so good
I have to say, they are all great but Keith and Eugene together always bring the best out of each other, and will always be my favorite duo. Both of them are funny on their own but when they're together it's just delightful how much they make me laugh. I would love more Ranking the Menu videos just to have these two interacting more!
The ONLY acceptable McGriddle is to lose that gd sponge egg!
This might be my new favourite try guys vid and I missed them together
YES!  More of you guys together!! Please!!! PLEASE
More Rank the Menu please!! Also Justice for the McGriddle, but yes the egg that goes with it is wet and not good.  Take the egg out and try it again!
In reference to you guys saying don’t go watch the Buzzfeed videos, I think you guys should add all extended versions of the original videos on your Second Try channel! Also I love this mashup!!!!
Amazing - more rank the menu please
More of this
I neeeeeeeeeeeed more of these
"The machine is broken" - aka we can't be bothered explaining the reason in detail so we say broken because it's easiest for you to understand. Hello from a past McEmployee in Ireland. Over here the machine would "break" regularly after making a very small few items because the machine has to cool back down after being used. Usually it takes about 30 minutes to an hour to be ready again. I always found it funny that the franchise refuses to replace the machines with more modern versions with a smarter cooling system, i forget the reasoning our big boss gave for not replacing it but it was generally just "we are not allowed to upgrade them until HQ say to".  Also McFlurry "straws" are Not straws xD Do not put them in your mouth, they connect to the machines that mix the ice-cream and toppings which you don't wanna be putting into your mouth ^^;
Keith and Eugene! McDonald’s does use extra syrup in their fountain drinks! That’s why they’re so good! And, Eugene has a good point about big straws.
I want more of this!!!!
23:12 This'll confuse some people, but... "HI! I'M A SHOUTY MAN!"
We must have more of these crossovers.
So, with the filet o fish, leave off the tartar sauce and dip it in the bbq sauce
I'm so sorry Eugene and Keith, but i need more of this asap. this duo is iconic.
Please do this again because this is a crossover we didn't know we could get but it was more than what we needed.
What if you both had your own order for your picks with your favorites meeting in the middle where the tables are joined? A head to head showdown.
the mcchicken slander is unacceptable
Actually about the quarter pounder half pounder thing, (although I'm not sure if this is still the case) quarter pounder patties weren't actually a quarter of a pound, they were a third, but people back then were too dumb to know what a third was so they would just say quarter to avoid explaining it. This means that a double quarter pounder would actually be two thirds which isn't a half. Though it's still closer to that than a whole pound, people nowadays are smarter and know what a third is even if a two thirds pounder doesn't really roll off the tongue but a half pounder wouldn't be accurate either. And Eugene's theory of double sounding better than half is also very valid.
love when Becky's spouses get together <3
It’s a real bummer that McDonald’s changed their apple pie. It used to be so good!
MORE PLEASE!!!!!!!! IM RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG, DO MORE OF THESE VIDEOS
….. does it do really Well?
EUGENE!!!!
Honestly I wouldn’t mind them doing more of rank the menu! Especially with places Kieth has already tried and then do again with Eugene and get two different opinions
'In the before times, in the before place' 😂🤣
Lol but Eugene’s into was soooo good lol
I'm obsessed with this
Chicken mcgriddle is a game changer, egg and cheese never belong on mcgriddles, long story short mcgriddles deserve better
A new series should definitely be Eugene Lee Yang Famous Internet Catholic it would be incredible
More Kieth and Eugene please.
This is a GREAT crossover!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m not gonna lie… I love y’all Eugene and Keith but sometimes y’all be talking so much heresy about the Catholic faith and even Jesus Christ in general it’s not cool man. Have you ever thought about why you’re here? What is the reason you’re alive? Why do we do what we do on our day to day basis? And what happens after death?  Come on man. If you feel a certain way about having faith in Jesus Christ just keep it to yourself. Don’t ruin it for other people who are just searching for the meaning of life. You deprive that for them when you bad mouth things. Then they become just another lost soul looking for a way home but their so lost they can’t find it. I say this because I care for you all, you guys are so talented  and such amazing people who can influence many.  I look forward to meeting y’all one day, I’ve been watching your videos since your buzzfeed days. Praying for you all and your family’s ❤️ God bless you Eugene and Keith, you guys are so Loved you don’t even know it yet ❤️…. Not by us humans tho, but by God. Who’s love is graceful.
More rank the menu(and Keith should sneak a McGriddle into the next one and see if it ranks higher compared to like… Wendy’s sandwiches or something)
is eugene drunk ghjk
Obsessed with every second
The Apple pie section is top tier lol
OMFG MY TWO FAVORITE WORLDS COLLIDE !!!!! <3 <3 <3 We missed you Eugene. It's been so long!!!
The local grocery here where I live sells giant bags of "fast food grade chicken nuggets" that are 100% Mcnuggets and it's awesome. Buy them all the time
Why not keep food in an oven on the keep warm setting? If thats an option anyway
100% more rank the menu or Ugene & Keith together
please more rate the menu!!!
Ok someone help me out. What word are we censoring that Eugene says with the pancakes? Is it cum? 😆
I gotta say I didn't know I needed this combination in my life!!! Go Keith and Eugene!!!
The first minute of this video is pure gold. Brilliance. Best intro ever.
Would love more rank the menus!
my hungover ass pulled into a mcdonalds drive through one morning and got the sausage egg adn cheese mcgriddle. i had to take the egg out bc idk i was not feeling it, but it kinda revitalized me. i dont think its intended for any other use lol
U should have people submit their weird fast food combinations and then u try them plzzzzz
“I like the Pope’s outfits, they’re suuuper gay”😂😂
Please read my other comment about fast food combinations
I WANT CHICKEN MCGRIDDLES! F YOU GUYS IM DRIVING TO MCDONALDS RIGHT NOW!
CAN U GUYS PLEASE DO WEIRD FAST FOOD COMBINATIONS LIKE EXAMPLE MY MC DONALDS OREDER IS A CHESE BURGER WITH ONLY CHESE AND MUSTARD NO MEAT WITH LOTS OF FRIES ON THE ACTUAL BURGER !!!!!!!!!!
We need more Rank the Menu!!!!! Dooo it! Doooo it! Doooo it!!!!
a dream collab my boys 💚
You can add hot fudge to the McFlurry!
I loved this we need more of it ^_^. Also an idea for 4 vs 1 potentially with ping pong
I’ve never been this early and so fast to click on a video lol
I'm soo pumped for this 🙌🏽  Honestly the best thing to wake up to 💜💙🤌🏼
I love how they both wore red and yellow and even the pillows match
As a fellow Texan who hates ranch, I can not agree with Eugene more!
We NEED more rank the menu! But also, how did that new crispy chicken sandwich make it so high up? I tried it once and wow, it was BAD. It might've been the bun. I remember hating that part the most.
Love this!! I would love to see a eat the menu rank king while high video.
love this but the music is too loudd
F
Itd take like an entire year but I'd like to see Eugene rank the short term items like Shamrock Shakes and McRibs from different restaurants.
Immediately think the sequel needs to be Whataburger. Keith needs to be educated real hard.
Yesss!!!
my fave thing at mcdonald's is their saddest burger: the hamburger 😳
I love this collaboration!!! Please do more😁
I won't lie, I feel like they did the crispy chicken sandwich a disservice by not getting the deluxe. I'm not saying it's a real competitor as far as chicken sandwiches go, but it's definitely better with actual condiments. Also maybe it's just cuz I'm still poor but I do love mcchickens lol. I get them with cheese, which I think helps.
I am offended at how low the McGriddle is. If they got bacon egg and cheese instead of sausage, it would be higher. Bacon egg and cheese McGriddle is top tier
The double cheeseburger is much better than the McDouble
The filet fish don’t sit right with me😭
The disrespect done to the McGriddle is unforgivable.
Eugene just mumbling gibberish when they’re introducing the food items made me giggle every single time. I’ve really missed Eugene and his Eugene-ish antics in videos recently and seeing as Keith is hands down my fave try guy this collab of their shows really was a happy thing for me! I hope this video performs so super well that they do this format like ten more times.
I have covids and this video made me feel worse.
I have to correct you guys on the fudge. from working at a McDonalds in the recent past, the fudge is in a bag, then it gets poured into a container to be warmed. we keep it in the area that the food is slid down to be bagged, then once it's warmed up properly and liquid and easy to dip into, we dip the cones into it. if it isn't the right consistency then the ice cream will fall in and get hard because it's the hard shell chocolate. we use the same for the ice cream in the cup but because it gets too cold again it won't stay hard or soft. it becomes kind of chunky and gooey inbetween.
My favorite thing from Macdonlds is getting fries and dipping them in a sundae
YES we need more of this show!!!
Keith and Eugene are such a pair
I'm with Eugene...no Ranch! 🤗 This was awesome! Good video! Great job! 🥰🥰🥰
Why did they stop the breakfast warp and will they start all day breakfast in the uk
"probably Michelle Obama" LMAO 🤣
“Oh, cuz I’m sooooo Catholic. Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic. 😒”
I definitely need more Rank the Menu videos!!!
I definitely own that pair of converse they’re talking about. ❣️ Love me some Try Guys
I appreciate that Eugene has been able to accomplish so much for a person who is constantly trying to sabotage everything including himself lmao
Mcnuggets suck. Wished you tried the McDouble. It’s the best thing on mcd’s menu.
Oreo McFlurry with the hot fudge 😇
I love how Eugene is speaking Simlish during each item reveal
The shirt vs pillow colors are very aesthetically pleasing 👌🏼
Do they really still not have a heat lamp lol
I want another rank the menu!!! The addition of Eugene is awesome! So much Kegene chemistry!
Eugene: Samantha, Keith: Miranda, Ned: Charlotte, Zach: Carrie. I'm right, you're wrong, shut up. 😂
Unfortunately-or fortunately?- the fries are flavored with beef. And are therefore not “not beef”. But it also makes it delicious.
🙋🏻‍♀️ another rank the menu!
Love this - make it a series, love you two together!
Well I guess I have to watch Yellow Jackets after this
Sorry Eugene but blank is not as thick as fake chocolate syrup. Just saying from experience.
As a catholic I can confirm after Ash Wednesday mass it is family tradition to go to McDonald's and have the Filet-O-Fish 😂
So here’s what we’ve learned, we love Eugene and Keith together, Zach and miles, and Ariel and Ned.. just facts
I could smell this video lol
McGriddle is better with only meat, Hashbrown Best.
Lol I ain’t know what the bleep word was until they ate the sundae 😂
Is Eugene's just saying gibberish when Keith is saying what the thing is
McDouble with Mac sauce, extra pickle, extra onion 👌🏻 Perfection.
Are the subtitles really fast/un synced for anyone else?
I think Eugene is right about the mcgriddle because he ate one with eggs it's better just as a sausage mcgriddle
you can only get sea cheese from uncut sailors
“It could be-beef” Eugene quoting the Supermodel Showcase sketch from SNL 😂 very subtle but we see you Eugene
The mcdonald’s app rewards is such a hidden gem, i don’t go to mcdonald’s a lot but getting free hashbrowns & sandwiches is a delight
thank you for this amazing crossover 😍😍 please do a rank the menu for taco bell! I know Eugene mentioned he ate it a lot in college, it's my favorite fast food, and since it was an early eat the menu I feel like the commentary was lacking in comparison to the more recent ones 😅
The crossover I didn’t know existed, but I’m glad it happened. I hope we see more Rank The Menu in the future.
When I was studying abroad in Asia this canteen at my dorm had chicken nuggets that we’re i swear 100% McDonald’s nuggets down 2 the shape, taste and fry
Baby people is my new favorite way to refer to children
JUSTICE FOR THE MCGRIDDLE
Yes. I need another video like this one.
Keith is everything!!♥️😭
I don't get it, what's wrong with the older video?
What do you do with all the left over food?
Commenting so u have to do this again 😌
Did anyone notice whenever they introduced food names Eugene always says random things like:  Keith: Big Mac Eugene: Falafel
Eugene's bite versus Keith's bite is hysterical
2 Hash Browns, 2 Bacon, Egg & Cheese McGriddles!! as soon as my hungover ass can find my keys, best hangover meal
I want you guys to go around trying the regional McDonald's items bc the spam eggs and rice breakfast platter that McDonald's serves in my hometown is heavenly. Also their haupia pies and fried apple pies 🤤
this feels like the disney channel crossover episodes…and those were always the best 😁
It’s sex AND the city not sex IN the city. Weird, right?
Yaaaas! This was great,please do more!!!
More please!! So good! Also, if you had put syrup on that pancake/nugget taco, it probably would’ve been delicious!
I absolutely loooved the McGriddle - I was so mad/sad when they took it off the menu where I am. I’m with Keith on it’s delicious.
Mcgriddles are in my top 5 easy. Maybe top 3
the McGriddle shade is worthy of a thumbs down... Also, best "hack": Double Quarter Pounder with Mac sauce instead of a Big Mac
Now Keith and Eugene just need to eat food together while they are high lol
Glad you did the pancakes and hashbrowns cause they're two of the few things I like at McDonald's....as bad as it is for you lol
Eugene: "Takes me back to 1912, when Titanic took her maiden voyage..."  I'm not sure if this proves or disproves that Eugene is just a charismatic vampire hiding in plain sight. Like, really old supernatural evil gets dates confused, right? There's a lot to remember in the last 1,200 years.
I got the notification for this video while in the Mcdonalds drive thru..weird.
I TRIED TO WATCH IT EUGENE. But I don’t have the channels or funds. And yes I will 100% forget to cancel the free trial. I always do 🙃
This whole episode made me not trust Eugene. Chicken nuggets at #1?  Mc Griddles almost last (no way it's worse than a fish sandwich). I've never disagreed with Eugene more in my LIFE.
Do we want another crossover like this. Hell yes we do. Love this combo
this needs to happen more often
This Keugene fast food collab was everything I needed. Please keep them coming!!
Great video! The music is a bit too loud tho and it’s hard to hear the guys talk because of it
32:15 #17 was bacon egg & cheese McGriddle. If it was sausage it would’ve been higher 🍵
2:09 the erg mr murfun
Mcdouble made like a Mac is the best
Fellow mcgriddler here, its much better when u ask for no egg
It went really well just sayin.. lol
My 4 favorite things were ranked in the top 5 so I feel validated lmao
Can we just take a second to appreciate how Eugene beautifully biffs every food intro it’s amazing pretty please do this again!
rank the menu the cheesecake factory  double homicide edition
McGriddle is like a dessert, I’m with Keith
The tree that smells the most ass is Ginkgo trees, but only certain ones because they don't all have berries and that is the source of the smell.
Oh my god Keith unlocked a memory for me. They used to have butterfinger mcflurries and I remember being devastated when they removed it.
I forget what Keith looks like without the stache.
RANK KING IS BACK
As a Canadian I’m so happy anytime it’s a familiar chain that I can eat 😂
They change apple pie. It sucks now, was fast food golf before
I think we can all collectively say that we need more Eugene and Keith eating and ranking
Omgosh I remember Doug and Patty Mayonnaise!!! Hahahahaha
A SHAMELESS REFERENCE <3
I was laughing so hard throughout the whole video and then at the very end about needle 💀💀💀
as someone who used to love ice cream from mcdonalds… it’s not the same since they’ve changed it and it breaks my fast food heart
Keugene
Justice for McGriddles
The Try Guys remind me of Disney's The Weekenders and I always dreamed of being a part of a really cool friend gang like you are <3
Keith should do eating all the food at the American girl doll cafe PLEASE
This is the crossover event of the year
seeing them talk about McDonald’s ice cream makes me want them to Eat The Menu/Rank King Dairy Queen’s blizzards and chicken strip box - I grew up on DQ after church on Sundays
More of Rank the Menu please
the mcchicken is amazing.
LOOOVE THIS IDEA!!!!
Sausage biscuit was robbed
I feel like ALL pancake mix smells like c** 🤔🤔 but ESPECIALLY those trees, I feel so seen lmao
We have a Bradford pear in our front yard and my husband thinks they smell like c*m 🤣 I think they smell fine. Maybe it’s a genetic like the cilantro/soap thing 🤔
McDonald’s fries also have beef flavor
Eugene, my dad’s name is Frank….
I love mcchickens!! But here in midwest mn they are $2.19. Not $1 😔
When they introduce each food I was trying to figure out if Eugene was speaking another language like Korean or French cuz I know he knows those languages ...but is he just speaking mumbles? has anyone figured it out? Lolol
I was team Eugene until he dare talk bad about Mcdonald's Pancakes 🧐‼️
i spent this video laughing at keith's growing trash pile
I love this video!!!! I know this is one I’ll be rewatching lololololollll
I fucking hate this Chicken sandwich battle between all the fast food places. I was okay with Mc"D Chicken and Chicken Ranch/bacon Sandwiches along with Wendys Chicken Sandwich pre-chickn fillet battle. Then along comes Popeyes and Chick Fil-A where their style is the same lettuce and tomato but theres a pickle....get that PICKLE away from my CHICKEN!
Where I went to college there were Bradford pears all over the city and they were commonly called “vagina trees” because of the smell.  Also PS Eugene isn’t a ranch fan because he’s not white. People who grew up around actually flavorful food don’t care about ranch lol.
Always a fan of the Keugene dynamic. More Rank the Menu, please!
In Canada, we have the McChicken and the Junior Chicken. Chicken is more expensive in Canada in comparison to the US so the McChicken is like 5 dollars and the junior chicken is on the value menu for like 2 dollars. Also, the crispy chicken sandwiches don't exist, we just go to Popeye's.
McDonald’s fries taste so different because of the beef flavoring added to them.
The "WHEN I WAS A YOUNG WARTHOG" had me dying omg
MORE RANK THE MENU, thank you.
Keith and Eugene is the combo we all needed this early into 2022. Always so pure of heart when they are together. Also, I loved that they matched the McDonald's colors/ketchup and mustard colors.
Go to Belgium & try the Fries in Quick. No salt on them at all. They give you a sachet of salt if you want to put it on yourself. Real Fries in Bruxelles is excellent. A European trip like the Australian trip is needed in 2022 or 2023
I love this collab
Love this collab! Would love to see more!!
Definitely need more of this!!
that’s because the folded egg is microwaved and the round egg is actually cracked and made on the grill
It’s back!!😆😆😆
Omgggg I missed Eugene so much!! Do more, do moooore!! ♡♡♡
IVE MISSED THIS DUO SM
I thoroughly enjoyed this
McChicken is number 1 in my heart
OMG, I LOOOVED THIS CONCEPT!!
I stopped this video at deserts to go get McNuggets.
y’all only don’t like mcgriddles because you’re getting old. they’re soooo good
Eggtalk has escaped the podcast 😂
I used to work for McDonalds and the folded egg is a liquid egg product and the other one is an actual egg.
Love how Eugene says "Enjera" 6:08 almost perfect 😊
Have to try a hashbrown on the double quarter pounder, it is great
I love the dynamic between these two lmao
MORE RANK THE MENU PLEASE!!!
I love when Eugene and Keith are together in videos. They really play off of each other well.
Rank the Menu might be the greatest thing you've ever invented 😂 throw the food babies in there and you've covered all three of my fave try guys shows lol 🤣
Dude this was a perfect combination of try guys video series! I love BOTH eat the menu and RankKing! Do it with Whataburger!! 🤣🤣😝😝
The apple pie in Europe looks so different - it's fried and fucking fantastic. What happened to US apple pie?
The best combo! 😉
The mcgriddle is the only thing I love at McDonald's then the fries
just like that is awful!!! but love the real show. lol
Sausage egg McMuffin should be on the list. Also the cheeseburgers are so nostalgic they are perfect. An Egg McMuffin is not that good. McGriddles are also higher.
Yes, please. This is the crossover that we didn't know we needed.
The USA McChicken is Canada's Junior Chicken.
i enjoy a good mcnugget, but above fries?!? insane!
The chemistry between Keith and Eugene is so underrated. Please make Rank the Menu a channel regular!
I feel you keith! All i want when i’m drunk is fried chicken 😂
RANCH IS SOOO GOOD I love it
Rank the menu Popeyes!
“At the before time, with the before place” 💀
i really love this rank the menu collab, i love the energy and comedic back and forth between keith and eugene. altho at the end they (or at least eugene) doesnt look forward to eating a menu again, id love for them to rank another subject together!
More Rank the Menu!!! So fun
I related so much to Eugene in this video. I am also a texan that does not like ranch because everyone around me would just dip their food in it 😅😅 It was gross for me
It's funny, in Canada, at least when I worked at McDonalds, all the breakfast sandwiches used the egg mcmuffin egg and not the scrabbled. Only the breakfast wraps have the scrambled eggs. Also for anyone curious, the egg rounds are cooked on an egg grill from real eggs, while the scramble is carton egg. The scrambled is also cooked on the normal grill and isn't that flat folded thing you have in yours.
Most of the food at McDonalds is absolutely disgusting.
I hate McGriddles the smell and taste of them make me actually sick
Whoa! The US Burgers look like crap. Seriously! Mc Donald in Poland has big, pretty and crunchy burgers with lots of ingredients, and they come in boxes so they’re not smashed when you order them to go :)
Very into rank the menu!
McDonald's is literally trash. I feel bad for your insides, guys.
Oh wow your country has some...interesting breakfast stuff at McDonald's!
Ok, but I loved this 😂 More crossovers!
I’m wrong, but I like the hotcakes.... you just need to eat them without utensils because you weren’t given any and you’re on some college campus for a robotics competition at like 6:30 in the morning when it’s ridiculously cold outside(where you’re sitting) but the hotcakes are warm like hot chocolate(or I guess coffee, but I was a kid)  Alternatively, you could eat them(without utensils again because you’re in a car and pouring syrup on a flimsy flat tray is not the move - you tear and dip them by the way) in the early morning on a road trip....any other time of day something else from McDonalds is what you want, BUT they can be good. - despite that aftertaste that I can recall right now, it mostly goes away with McDonald’s sprite though, which may sometimes be worse?
Not that I’m a McGriddle stan; But in my opinion, eating a regular Sausage McGriddle is 10x times better than the Sausage, Egg, and Cheese McGriddle.
Rank the Menu Taco Bell!!!
Did not know I needed this kind of video... but now, I want more of it...
this feels like old disney channel when they would make a collab between hannah montana and the suite life
Great work fellas! So fun :) Definitely a smile for my day
Best collab, two worlds colliding.  I would love to see more
I’m offended that the McGriddle isn’t #1
I would love more of this crossover. But it doesn’t have to be food if it makes you feel so bad!!  What about ranking all the yankee candles? Or better yet— as a sort of sister video to Safiya melting all those candles—you could rank all the Bath & Body Works candles? A lot of them have food scents so Keith could comment on how close (or not) the smell is compared to the actual food?
the hot fudge sundae or the caramel sundae with a cheeseburger and fries was my go to McDonalds order as a child.
not eugene going "하나 둘 셋" to count with keith
This collab is such a gift. The cold open was hilarious. I’m barley 3 minutes in and I’m dying 😂
Okay hear me out though.... Keith's taco sauce on the sausage egg mcmuffin. Trust me.
Sea cheese, like sea glass, but cheesier
More of this! We need this collab! All of the cross overs!
Rank King Eats The Menu IS THE BEST CROSSOVER IN HISTORY.
I was given a McGriddle by mistake once when I ordered a biscuit.  It was SO gross!
So funny! I love the BK commercial that plays in the middle 😂
It’s like Becky always said “all Keith needs is a little more Eugene”
Oh man I'd love to see more crossovers like this!! I think a really good rank king could be Zach and Eugene ranking popular tea flavors!!
You gotta get the chicken McGriddle, it's like fast food's chicken and waffles.
How about a Dunkin Donuts ranking?  Btw, the omelette bites are horrible.
Me trying to work out what word they were censoring Eugene: There's a type of tree Me: Ohhhhh
justice for the mcgrittles
I  NEED  MORE of this! The dynamic between Eugene and Keith is 🤌
It’s actually the oil for the fries I’m pretty sure! They use really good oil
I really missed this, I've been skipping some of the videos now and then but this brought me back. Thanks guys :)
The Filet o Fish is soft and pretty simple in flavor so I like it for what it is, to be honest.
E:I could pour water on your face as I jab you with a needle.:D K:That could do it... I guess... :S  Dead. Deceased. Ghost. Thanks gents!!!!
My favorite burger at McDonald's was the Angus Mushroom, but they don't have it anymore 😭🍔
20:29 did not think eugene could sing. for being spontaneous and done jokingly, that was surprisingly good.
This needs to be a regular thing y’all, we must make this video do well
a mashup i didn't realize i needed
Hate to Burst your BUBBLE but one hash. Brown in Florida is $1.69 and McChicken a $1.89.  Yep gotta suck 👍
I'm offended that there isn't more rage about how low the McGriddle was ranked it's literally my favorite breakfast food
Alright I lost it when Keith said the McChicken was, "a bock." I laughed too hard.
Nice to see Eugene back.
This was awesome!  More Rank The Menus!
I can not believe hot cakes were the worst 😫
I love literally everything about this. I didn’t know I need it until now.
This was hilarious, please make more Rank the Menus 😂😂
Raise your hand if you felt personally victimized when Eugene said that hotcakes should be last 🙋🏻‍♀️
P!ease rank the menu again! This was so good!!!!
So, I saw a video where someone said that McDonald’s Contracts Coke (that autocorrected Coke to C*m & I was like, the influence this video has to my text 👀) & Coca Cola makes McDonald’s a special recipe syrup to use for their Fountain Sodas. Also, they use bigger straws because there is apparently a science behind it that makes it more carbonated.
The Titanic cold open took me out 😂
I hope you guys do another rank the menu, this was so much fun to watch!
What happened to the hot and spicy? A cheap item that doesn’t get enough credit
Yes can we have a rank the menu for kfc and also if you still doing eat the menu can you do a buc-ees eat the menu please. I think you might have more fun with it
My two favorite Try Guys (love all of them but these two have a special place in my heart and funny bone)
This is incredible. What a crossover. More!!
I love that the filet o fish is in the middle, as someone who loved it and could only eat that. It makes me happy.  But then again the filet o fish tastes different in every country.
Wow I can’t believe Eugene Lee yang is collating with the try guys
I knew exactly what tree you were talking about we had one in our front yard and for years we could not figure out what was causing the smell lol as soon as we did we chopped that sucker down so quick!
Eugene and Keith are magical together!
I don’t know why, but I think I’m going to watch yellowjackets
As a former multi year McDonald's manager in charge of facilities.. The Ice cream machine is quite rarely actually broken, they just don't clean it or fill it properly so it locksdown and has to be cleaned fully to work again (takes about 3hours to do and it's wretched) :)
One of the reasons the McDonald’s fries and hash browns taste so good is because they are fried in animal fat. Sadly I’m a vegan
Loved it!
Keith and Eugene are delightful together in this! And it was so nice to see Eugene so relaxed and very funny and playful 😘
I’m just sad there wasn’t a mcspicy
The concept of this video gives the same energy as Taylor Swifts re-records.
Eugene's william H macy and shameless pun is top tier😂
0:19  "The before times, at the BEFORE PLACE" ... ah yes, at the Company That Shall Not Be Named
one of the VERY few friend groups where every single friend, is best friends with every single person, like zach, eugene, ned and keith all have the biggest, best energy  with each other
Eugeith
Bruh it is athleticism to eat all this food  I get sick watching them get Ill and delirious
Common sense calls for reeses pieces mcflurry
McChicken is $3(!!!!) here!
A McGriddle is, indeed, a dream come true. Accurate, Keith.
All us hot cake lovers crying in the club
I’m quite salty about the ranking of the McGriddle! But I will say, you ordered it wrong 😂 I liked when they had the chicken McGriddle and I added bacon to it 🤤 but just always get rid of the egg and eat them with bacon. It’s a necessity!
You guys should do The Try Guys Feat Old Gays!!! Pleeeeeeaseeeeee!
The top 5 are definitely solid.
Keith, next time you should try a Chicken McGriddle with cheese.
listen. the nuggets are NOT #1
Am sad the mcgriddle got such a bad rank. It's literally one of my favorite things for fast food breakfast!
this killed me😭😭😭😭
McFlurry is a Canadian invention
Was Keith about to barf at 33:23? Lol
the crossover I didn't know I needed
I totally agree with Eugene about ranch; FYI saturating food in ranch doesn't make me want it
This would be a perfect list if they have the breakfast burritos
Sorry but for me the Double Quarter Pounder with cheese reigns supreme. Add bacon to it and it ascends even higher.
I hope somebody sees this! The subtitle timing seems to be off starting from the end of the video intro (0:42). This is an accessibility issue and it lasts for the whole rest of the video. Is there any way to fix it? For those of us who are partially deaf (so we have some hearing but rely on subtitles to fill in what we can't make out), the sync issue makes trying to follow what's being said even harder rather than helping. :(     EDIT: Yay! It's been fixed. :D
The McGriddle needs to be in the top 5! It’s amazing! 😛
I worked at a McD’s in the early 00’s and they never fried those pies. Looked it up: they haven’t been fried since 1992…. Aka: before most of your staff was born. Lol!
This was great!
As a middle child, I accept Eugene as my king 🤴
Putting the mcgriddle that far back is blasphemy 😤
The chicken sandwich is one of the best things in the UK McDonald's
We've been traveling in the US for almost 5 months and haven't eaten McDonald's yet, but now I want me some nuggets!
Egg's are freshly made (can confirm)
I love when a video with Keith uses a Mozart horn concerto for some of the music 🎶
LOVE THIS COLLAB…these two were the perfect combo 🙌🏻
Here in Hawaii, we have fried apple pies! Soooo good 🤤
If you ever come to Utah, you neeeeed to do Artic Circie!!!!!
Justice for hash brown!
I would love to see a lot more of these kinds of videos. I truly enjoy all of the content that the try guys create and mixing and mashing them can only get better from here. 🤘🏽
I completely agree with the list.
Justice for the McGriddle
wish I could like a vid more than once
Yessss! we want more of this!!!!
couldn’t even dream of this duet, and also McDonald's! thanks!
MCGRIDDLE
Unpopular opinion but i think the file of fish is perfekt if you want Fastfood but nothing heavy like a bigmac that sits in your belly for hours on end for example on a hot summer day  There is a time and place for it
This right here is the culmination of my fucking existence
I love to see another rank the menu Keith and Eugene are hilarious together
Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich add bacon and cheese. God tier item
Please do this again!!!
The long-awaited collab has come!
The apple pie is accidentally vegan !
24:22 when they bake the bread, they slice it into 3 pieces, and only use the middle patty for the Big Mac, and they use the rest for regular burgers. There’s a video on it, called how McDonald’s is made
Omfg I was literally just thinking about wanting a rank king episode again 😭😭 dreams do come true
Keith calling kids ¨baby people¨ >>>>
They grew so delirious towards the end I think it was all of the oil🤣
egg texture grosses me out 🤢
Okay, so a) McGriddles are one of the best things at McDonalds, haha, and b) The real travesty is that the salads - particularly the Southwest Salad - are gone. :( That was the best. Also, c) McDonalds in China is WAY better. I lived there for a year, and there was this one spicy burger that was insanely good. KFC also had a Sichuan burger that I still dream about sometimes, lol.
Rate the Menu, OR, and hear me out, Eat the Rank King
I know EXACTLY the tree you are talking about - they used to bloom outside my college dorm room and would make everything smell like them 😬
Watching this as I’m eating McDonald’s breakfast 😍
Pretty sure you can request the real egg for any of the breakfast sandwiches. The mcgridle is way better w/o the wet sponge they pass of as egg.
I bought McDonalds for lunch today just to watch this video while I ate. A+.
I love this video!
I adore this collaboration, please do more of these mash ups!!
i hate you for making me want to go to mcdonalds
This was pure gold plz do more <3
That squeaky censor noise makes ugly words sound so cute lmaooo 😂😂
Lol is it just me, or does Keith get shorter as the episode progresses?
Noticed how often Keith chose to eat the sandwiches bottom bun up?  Is there a life hack message hidden in there? I think it’s safe to assume the sandwiches were designed to be consumed top side up. However I’m open to change. I defer to the more experienced. Educate us Keith!
There has got to be SOMETHING so y'all aren't eating AS cold of food by the end. A reptile heating lamp, those pads you put plants on to germinate them, a lil bitty microwave, SOMETHING.
This was amazing
more rank the menu please!
Love this, please do more rank the menus!
What a delightful video lol MORE
honestly didn't know i needed this but damn this is such a great video
The before times, in the before place, we don’t talk about that place, bad place
Again! I need more! But with better food.
I do not like the music that has been added to this video. It is too loud and at a certain point it felt like someone just left the radio on scan.
I love the big breakfast from McDonalds, the pancakes are so good.
If snack wraps were still around they’d make the top of the list 😔
UGH WHAT A DREAM.  LOVE YOU BOTH
Loved this collab! Keith and Eugene, you both made my day! Keep it up Try Guys!
If Eugene is Samantha and Keith is Carrie, I guess that makes Ned Charlotte and Zach Miranda?
I don’t know why but dang cold chicken nuggets are the best
The sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is my go to mcdonalds breakfast but you have to take the hashbrown and add it to the sandwich fucking gamechanger!!!!!
What is the word they’re bleeping? Lol
Eugene lovesss to brag about himself in literally every video he’s in😂😂😂
The apple pie was better fried
Chicken nuggets are so weird though
The Try Guys watch Yellowjackets! My two biggest interests are combining!
🤣🤣🤣 look for it being on the dollar menu I’ll still eat them both it’s my go to mcchicken with extra Mayo and a McDouble with a small fry. Easy. Also I love McGriddles. But I am also that friend who judges you for eating McDonald’s it’s literally only eaten twice a year for me during exam weeks when I’m already feeling like crap.
Do it again! Love Eugene and Keith together. But they don't have to hurt themselves. Get inexpensive and top shelf weed and have them rank that.
The spicy mcchicken is where it’s at
Please get Mythical Chef Josh on a rank king video!
I love Eugene
I am a mcgriddler and I do have questions. Number one: how dare you
I love the refusal to say things in sync
Love this series!
My favorite try guys together I love this. Eugene needs to be a regular from now on with eat the menu 🖤
Keith missed the chicken mcgriddle and chicken biscuit.
i never comment but this video was absolutely hilarious, i need to see more of it
I have to stop watching because I can literally smell this video and it's making me very nauseous at the moment 😂💀
The McDouble is still my go-to. Extra ketchup, mustard, onions, and pickles makes it perfectly balanced 🤌
Everyone alr tryed it
I’m happier about Eugene‘s return than I should be!
and they said marvel had the most ambitious crossovers
Complete waist of time
The McGriddle is so gross.
Mcgriddle stan here. no egg. the egg ruins it.
“I love Pope outfits because they are super gay” Best line ever!!
I got a burger King add on this video lmao
this is my new favorite!!!
Oh hey, a McDonald's with an operational ice cream machine.
Best crossover ever!! Marvel who??
Freaking love this video
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS VIDEO
Just to clarify, the McDonald fries made in the U.S are actually made with beef oil so it's not "non-beef". Great video regardless and i love the collab between Rank King and Eat the Menu <3
If you’re a salty-sweet person who likes syrup on sausage or bacon then the McGriddle is the best thing ever and sometimes it’s a necessary evil
You can see them slowly getting grease crazy
The pancakes taste like coffee creamer there nasty 🤢
Love u guys... lost my mama Sept 30th 2021.. she was only 53.. it came unexpectedly..I introduced her to u guys. She loved you all. You're videos bring me comfort. Thank you.
Keith talking about a McDouble and a mcchicken.... Know what a mc gang bang is????
im infuriated that they didnt eat the oatmeal which only furthers my suspicion that i'm the only person under the age of 90 who orders fucking mcdonalds oatmeal
So is not just Keith who acts drunk after too much fast food, I love that Keith's work and effort tasting everything is being appreciated, Eugene looks like he found a new respect for him.
can you guys do a Secret menu for all the fast food restaurants pretty please?!  for macdees there's fried apple pie dunked in plain icecream cup!
I fully appreciate someone suffering along with Keith while eating all of that food and fully support that it was Eugene who stepped up and took the hit! lol
i love u guys
Wow when the mcgriddle is the best thing on the menu and I've literally asked everyone I know if they like it. It's especially perfect for a hangover! Idk how Eugene didn't like it 🥲
I wonder how the “before” place is doing.  IYKYK
My top 5 is  Any drink Nuggets Quarter pounder w cheese  Hot and spicy Bacon mcdouble They did screw up the apple pies!!!
In Asia we have seasonal special like curly fries, and crispy spicy fried chicken, and chicken sausage wrap, iced milo.
Commenting so this video happens again
Guys a hot cake taco (no syrup)  + a piece of bacon + a piece of hash brown 👍👍
I knew this collab was goin wrong when Eugene rated that mcgriddle so low
Omg last time u guys upload new video i was thinking i wish tryguys try mcdonal menu, and then  i found that keith already did that, and i upset. But thankyou for making my day. ( i didn't watch the buzzvideo because i want to support u guys more, hehehe)
The greatest crossover in cinematic history.
No!! There’s crack in the McDonald’s cheese, I swear! It’s the best part of the breakfast sandwiches
Funfact, in bc canada they don't serve the "canadian bacon" mcmuffin. They have actual bacon, and sausage or no protein.
i saw a tiktok about the different eggs. the square ones come frozen and are done on the stovetop and the circle ones are actually cooked in store
You BETTER do this again!! 🙏😂
Do more of these lots more of these!!!! Go back and do all the eat the menus this way. Love Keith and Eugene combo 💕
MORE OF THEEEEEEEEEEEESE
they were so stoned
Omg I LOVE Keith and Eugene videos THE BEST
i watched all the keith eats everything when i had covid and couldn't smell or taste anything. Idk if it was to torture myself or remind myself that food can taste like things, but it brought me some semblance of comfort. Thanks guys

It’s crazy cause I just went through all of the Rank King videos..but also thanks to the ole clock app we learned that the egg McMuffin has a real fresh cracked egg on it while everything else basically gets rehydrate powdered premade folded eggs
Psssst Keith, in Hawaii McDonald’s still fries their apple pies!
Absolutely want another Rank the Menu with a chicken spot!
Thank you for standing up for the Filet-o-Fish Keith, appreciate you
Love the video but ranking is WAY off.. Sorry, I'm right, you're wrong!
I love Keith and Eugene's friendship!
This is just my take but if I do get breakfast items at McDonalds, I get the Mcgriddle and instead of sausage I get bacon! It’s sooo good and since I think the sausage overpowers the other ingredients
I like this format!
I love it so much when it’s Keith and Eugene being chaotic with each other. It’s so fun to watch! Thank you for this amazing collab
why do i get the vibes that they low key don’t like each other….
YES YES YES Please do more of this
more rank the menu plz
MORE RANK THE MENU!!!! 😍😍😍
THIS VIDEO DID WELL, DO ANOTHER ONE, I ORDER YOU TO DO ANOTHER ONE! NAY, I TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU TO DO ANOTHER ONE!
Bow tie
More rank the menu please !!!
Already liked this video on “eat the menu” VS “the rank king” intro 🍟🤴🏻
This was a delight
Try guys should do more food ranking with Keith and Eugene,  sorry Ned and Zach but Keith and Eugene are my two favorite try guys
Rank the menu: Wingstop Edition please
The spicy mcchicken...they forgot about it. It's like 10000x better than the plain one...still not great but not terrible
OK, I NEED more Rank the Menu videos now!!! This was my favorite Try Guys video I've watched in a while.
Finally, someone else in the try guys gets to see how Keith feels after this video. We love to see it.
I really love seeing Keith and Eugene together.
Hi Eugene... I'm also Korean. Hehe.... Anywhoooo I wanted to say you seem significantly and noticeably happier in recent videos than in earlier videos. And I'm glad to see that :) cheers
I loved McDonald's breakfast, but during 2020 they deleted it from the menu (for pandemic reasons), and than reintroduced it summer of last year... But they change a lot of it and now it is disappointing... The McToast was a panini-like bread, now its regular toast... I don't need to buy this, I can make it at home... -.- I'm really mad about you, McDonalds, just sayin'!!!! (Greetings from Germany tho xD) We have only 5-ish fast food chains in here, so alternatives are limited...
Keith's content is the best on this whole channel. No offense to the other guys. I love you, but Keith is the funniest try guy.
As a fellow middle child, Eugene's comparison to a big mac is truly fucking perfect
Seeing Eugene with Keith's sauce makes me think that Eugene HAS to do a rank the sauces video
keugene. the best collab EVER
mcgriddle superiority
The best McGriddle is with chicken because it’s like chicken and waffles.
The Holiday custard pie was INCREDIBLE, the strawberry and creme and guava pies were pretty great too
Eugene just mumbling gibberish each time for the item title got me each time. It was so dumb but so funny please send help. Actually he was in great form this whole ep - love to see Keith playing the straight man for once.
This video has given me the munchies!🥴
Do they not have a food warmer at the office for you guys at this point? C’mon y’all!
Lmaaaoo “the before place” 🤣🤣🤣 smooth dudes
the mcgriddle is capitalism's best argument
Um, I'm sorry, what? 😂💕 Literally of course I knew Eugene could sing, and was like okay great, but 20:25 when Eugene sings when I was a young warthog, I'm sorry excuse me, what?!?!?!?!?! That was incredible!!!!!! That was just very casually incredible beautiful singing at basically a professional level, where's my musical theatre Eugene album, rude!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love this combo! Do more!!!
the mcgriddle is a culinary invention mcgriddle slander will not be tolerated 😔😩
Eugene “hasn’t eaten breakfast” my entire life
more keith and eugene together!
Combining the formats together was really interesting, would like to say that I’m a bit sad that there were no cookies from Mcdonald’s. In my family at least, the cookies were pretty iconic.
Funny
You can see them slowly loosing their minds as the video progresses
I'm commenting because I love the collab.  Now I'm going to go do something.
Alternative title: Eugene ranks the c*m in McDonalds foods while Keith Opens Wide 😲
I agree about the baked apple pie but what Keith probably remembers is the fried apple pie which only Hawaii has now and it is SO good
I wish you had the guava and cream pie. It's reagonal, but I like it as much as the apple pie.
I like rank the menu! And I don’t love McGriddles so no shade from me.
I like how Eugene hates physical touch but when it comes to giggling with Keith, he always hits his arm or leans on him when he laughs
So Keith would get McGangbangs! Love that quick little throwaways after the filet o fish!
MORE RANK THE MENU!!!!
Sausage McGriddle is bad ass! 👍
Don't they bake the pies to keep them vegan now? To avoid cross contamination with oil that was used to cook meat. It seems they still fry them in the UK though?
Rank the menu needs to be a regular thing
Life changing, if you haven’t done this - always order two hash browns with your McDonald’s breakfast combo. Put one INTO THE SANDWICH.
After the fries are Fried they put a powder on them containing salt and some stuff that has a slight taste of beef that’s why they are so good or at least that’s what I read about that
i think chicken nuggies should've got 3rd place. don't get me wrong i looove them but the fries and the hash brown is something else
LOVE THIS!! “I’m right, you’re wrong, OPEN WIDE!”
Hotcakes with nuggets is that a new menu hack lol
The mcchicken is not a $1 anymore its $3
McNuggets are the worst! I loved the video, but I disagree with the king.
Lol first commercial on here was Burger King. 😂
I love Kieth and Eugene. There's not enough content of just the two of them lol
The way Keith and Eugene just play off eachother is my new high in life.
28:06 Should be two children one named Sarah and one name Dipitous (obviously Dippy for short)
Damn American mcflurry cups weird as hell
"The Before Times"
I can't with Keith. He has really been in the trenches with us. 'you eat one, you want another, you eat two..you feel bad" so accurate. I have been so sick this week this has cheered me up so much!!!!!  Thank you
This is funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tbh here in the UK that style of "pancake" is called Scotch. Dunno why, but they're damn fine.
McDonald’s has three different eggs. The round egg which is just a normal egg cracked and the yolk broken, the folded egg which is basically some processed egg or whatever and the scrambled eggs which is liquid from a carton and scrambled
Love the cross over
I love this so much!  Please do another colab!!!  You two are so funny together!
Love it! Although if you come towards the Midwest Frischs has their big boy sandwich with the middle bun, so it's not only the big mac!
i can officially say that keugene is the ship that eugene loves loudly the most HAHAHA
Is the video sponsored by yellow jackets
The curious child in me wants to know what word they censored. I must know.
More Keugene please!!
Isn't McDonald's supposed to be great in the USA?!? The food looks so much worse than the ones we have here in Portugal! I wish we had hash browns tho!!
Filet-o-fish fam where you at?
I’ve been asking!!!!! For!!!!! This!!!! I love!!!! Also yes the McDonald’s eat the menu on bf is trash don’t watch it
More rank the menu! That was great
I've never been this early, so excited
YES MORE RANK KING I love Eugene videos
Y’all need to look up the TikTok of that person making the McDonald’s eggs
This is the most iconic video. We need more eat the menu and rank king cross overs
I loved this. I love when the guys get to do things together.
Eugene and Keith are total opposites for how much food they put in their mouth per bite
It was so fun seeing Eugene in one of these!
How do you not include the Sausage Egg McMuffin ?!?!?
Glad to see them in McDonalds colors too hahaha
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING
This video hands down is great!
MORE OF THESE PLEASE! Hahaha so much fun!
This was almost as good as their toxic masculinity.
Please don’t let this be the last rank king and eat the menu mash up!
Man the captions on this are really off sync
Don't you know? There is no before!
Yellowjackets is really good! I also can't stop talking about it!
The only other fast food rank the menu should be whatabuger since that’s a Texas staple and Eugene is our spicy Texan.
I’m having the worst day of my life for the 7th day this week. This video helps
The chicken nuggets are the nastiest thing. Idk how people eat them. They should be illegal.
Hey Keith!! The mcgriddle is too mushy and sweet, sausage+egg+mushy bread=no texture. If I'm stoned enough from wake n baking, I'll definitely get a bacon egg mcgriddle (among a few other things 🐽). Salty off set the sweet & the bacon gives it a different texture... Makes the mcgriddle actually palettable.
Could you imagine being in the ocean and there's just hamburger buns and tarter sauce floating around? <wink>
Eugene's so extra goofy in this one, it's AMAZING! He's really having a fun time, and THAT'S good entertainment! Got me laughing so hard at "Cuz I'm so CaTHoLiC! Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic!" XDDD
Are they wearing the McDonald’s colors on purpose?
More Rank King!!!
So Keith and Eugene collabing to rank the fried chicken of the world (or at least available fried chicken of their area) when? That or a cooking show of Keith attempting to cook the various fried chickens of the world and plugging his chicken sauce in the entire time.
YAY COLLAB
Yes I'm with Keith justice for mcgriddles! Lol but I love the chaos and balance that ensues from Keith and Eugene collabing together! It definitely is the Samantha and Carrie of the group lol.
Fun fact - Mcdonald's fries contain beef flavoring so I don't think fries should be allowed in the no beef section.
ingera bread? YESYESYES do an ethiopian eat the menu omg
This will do well. Already waiting for the next video 🙂🙃
I got McDonald's for lunch and was looking forward to eating while watching the new Try Guys video. Imagine my surprise when I saw the title. I'm so excited all around!
Steak, Egg, and Cheese Bagel is THE BEST breakfast item they have. A little sad it was left out
Can we all agree that Disneyland McDonald’s Westward Ho Fries we’re amazing. I miss it so much
I was sad when mcd's got rid of their buttermilk chicken sandwich and replaced it with the one they have now. I LOVED the buttermilk chicken sandwich!!!
"You go to McDonald's for both the taste....and the nostalgia."  I think that should be changed to "You go to McDonald's for both the taste....and the diarrhea."
We need more food ranking videos with Keith and Eugene!
I heard Eugene speak korean 1 2 3
Finally more ranking videos!
Eugene was obviously talking about the Ginkgo tree not some random pear bullshit
they were definitely high in this vid tell me im wrong lmao it was hilarious
This is so amazing I need more Rank the Menu 👏👏👏
i haven’t had Mcdonald’s since before the pandemic and this video is making me crave it so bad right now lol
You guys did forget one item , the mcrib
this, this is the content we wanted
WE GOT THE RANKING THE MENU EPISODE! Thank you guys for listening to us😭💖
I wonder if Brazilian McDonald’s is that different from USA’s bc here the chicken nuggets suck
As a Nordic person, it horrifies me that Americans call those breakfast. That's like dinner for me
Fun fact: fountain sodas vary in taste based on the how clean the fountain heads are.  You ever get kind of a weird taste you just can’t place? It’s most likely mold on the fountain head.  You’re welcome
Let me just say I have been eating the filet of fish since childhood
Love this mash up!
I'd've put the syrup on the McNuggetPancakeTaco, but that's because I always liked the mcnuggets with honey as a kid, and also I hate ranch 🤭
I would totally switch the fries with the McGriddle. I might be only because I live in Germany but here the McDonalds fries are at the bottom of nearly all fast food chains. They are floppy and either under- or oversalted and to thin.
Just realized that the Mcgriddle in Puerto Rico has actual eggs. There is no way that Mcgriddle is can compare with the one they make here.
i wonder if the us version of fast foods especially McDonalds really that bad in comparison to the places in other countries, cause many of the items that they say are bad are actually really good here (like the chicken sandwich here are so juicy and kinda has different breading i think) or if i just have bad taste
As a Texan I’m also not a big ranch fan. So I feel ya Eugene 😉
"yeah you feel bad after these" guys I love this series but please I think I speak for the fans that we'd prefer y'all not to feel bad! Imma huge fan and I love you guys! Stay safe this winter!
Eugene saying he was trying to swap Keugene the other way around made me realize it probably would be "euth" (pronouncdd youth) and that would not fly I think 😬
Every time he disses the McGriddle, it's triggering. But I absolutely love them doing these rankings. We need more.
Lmaoooo the way that I got a Burger King ad during this
Tbh, i cannot blame or criticize the pope for saying what the catholic church has been saying for 2000 years, it’s kind of his job as the CEO of the thing. Like The CEO of nestle saying they are a good company, same thing.
Nuggets over fries and hash brown 🥺
Cant
The best thing about McDonald's breakfast is you can actually substitute the meat and eggs so you can get exactly what you want
immediately comments for more rank the menu pls
I'm extremely happy to finally see a New Rank King! Thank you Eugene! I realize you didn't rank my beloved Fillet of Fish very high, but that's fine since you threw McGriddle to the bottom. Love you bunches. Hi Keith.
Love Eugene throwing in “하나 둘 셋”
my favorite try-duo/friendship! i love how they and their significant others pretty much became a platonic quad-ple
Closed captions are not in sync with the audio. 😔😔
You guys have to do another one of these PLEASE
Try and the guys  Eugene=Samantha Ned=Miranda Keith=Carrie  Zach=Charlotte
Epididymis
happy for Eugene to be king of middle children
I need more Rank the menu!!!!
What about the Homestyle Burger???
I am SO here for their color coordination. ❤💛
You can request the "good" egg on any sandwich. Ask for a whole egg. So much better that the folded foam thing.
Love this collab! Mcgriddles deserves better though haha. The sausage one is perfectly balanced and the only thing i get at McDonald's haha
please more of this!! i miss keith and eugene interacting so much 😭
Keith: « oooohhh, of course »  I lost it
See the thing is, I don’t like regular chicken sandwiches from anywhere, but every place that sells them the spicy ones are so good. Spicy chicken sandwich > not spicy chicken sandwich.
The hole in the mcflurry spoon is so it can be attached to a stirrer
I am watching this while on my 30min break at McDonald’s
Was this by any chance filmed after the weed trivia?
In Canada all of the McDonald's breakfast comes with the round egg
I'd eat the pancake chicken taco. Top it with the hotcake syrup. It would be good.
Either they got on old chicken patty or an over cooked one....for the big chicken sandwich
As someone who HATES Ranch, Eugene made me feel validated af.  Thank you, Eugene.  <3  I wanna eat foods with you guys!!
"Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic." STOOOOOPPPPPPP LOL
Y’all should absolutely do this again! Absolutely loved it!!
Liked this collab. Not sure when it was filmed, but if it is the 1st of a series I hope that there was a considerable rest period at a spa (COVID-permitting)  before continuing this series.
The McGriddle is an Amazing work of art. I can’t believe it wasn’t in front of the biscuit let alone in the front.
More rank the menu!!!😂❤
I was thinking the same with the Apple Pie boxes
Eugene Lee Yang: Famous Internet Catholic
10/10
The filet o fish used to be so good, but now the half slice of cheese and lack of sauce makes it. Awful lmao
Yay! More Rank the menu!
Seacheese would make for some real funky spunk.
You guys should try this same video but either drunk or high and see how much the rank changes….
Eugene constantly saying random words and noises while introducing the next item had me in stitches
Good 'ol Eugieth team up 👍
Ahahahahaaa so excitedddd
the music's too loud
Euith the Menu?
I really enjoyed this video!! Haven't seen Eugene in a while, still excited about what he's making!!
Yay crossover of ranking and eat the menu.
Clearly the hotcakes are PANCAKES
Love
Um, you didn't try the Big Mac?!
I love beautiful, silly Keugene! :-D
Keugene, eugeith, love me a series crossover
Honestly, I'm a queer Korean ajumma who lives in Texas so my bias will always and forever be Eugene. I love Rank King because I love sarcasm. I'm sort of meh about Eat the Menu--there's always a moment in every video where I just start to feel sad & sorry for Keith. I did love this mash up though. Something about it worked really well. Please bring us more Rank the Menu!
Yes, Rank the Menu!!!
Whose gonna tell Keith that the whatacatch was discontinued
I can never forgive Eugene for ranking the McGriddle so low.
✨✨✨Coom ✨✨✨✨✨
“What shirts shall we wear” “‘Match the cushions”
As a middle child, this video makes me feel seen 🤣
Eugene: Unless this video does really well...  Challenge accepted, friend.
Keith should eat everything at Pollo Campero for that Guatemalan 🇬🇹 fried chicken 🍗. Where my chapines at ?
im obsessed with all the satc references thank you
the opposite of Keugine is Eugeith
More frequent videos of eat the menu
WE NEED MORE RANK THE MENU
"Unless this goes really well..." See you at BK. And Taco Bell.
eugene: keith u r so talented  keith: i know
Wait these series have been going on for 5 years??? It feels like yesterday.
Yessss Eugene that tree smells JUST like it! Some people think I’m crazy!!!!
Bradford Pear is an awful tree, but the one that smells like that is chestnut 🤢
would love more rank the menus!
McDonald's has the best fountain Dr.pepper and the original Cajun mcchicken was so good. It absolutely has gotten worse
The fact that they got all of their Sex and the City characters correct! Keith= Carrie, Eugene= Samantha, Zach= Miranda, Ned= Charlotte
not for lent, for fridays!!
My top 5:  1. McFlurry  2. Fries 3. Hash browns 4. McNuggets 5. McGriddle
We’re never doing this again… unless this does really well. 75k views on a 34 minute video in an hour. I think we will see more of this
The energy of this video is "haven't seen the bestie in ages and now you two are trying to outweird each other because you've missed each other so much"
Please rank Popeyes food 😂
Rank the menu
I used to hate McDonald's breakfast when it was first introduced in Germany, because during their breakfast times, they would *only* serve the breakfast stuff. But if I went to McDonald's during breakfast times, then I was usually on a road trip. And if I've been driving on a road trip for hours at that point and am hungry, I don't want no dinky ass McMuffin, I want a Big Mac.
Y'all got the wrong McGriddle. If you want the pinnacle of McGriddle, you have to go off menu and get a Steak, Egg, and Cheese McGriddle. It's sweet, savory, and bound to shave years off your life. But it's absolutely the best menu item.
I love how Keith and Eugene appear to be in a food coma in the last half of the video.
It’s not a bowtie it’s a bone. Unsubscribing.
Justice for the McGriddle man 😩
I love how the try guys sensor all the bad words with a squeky sound and also keith’s face HHAHAH LOVE IT !!!!🤣❤️
Me. I'm the McGriddle stan they're talking about.
Eugene didn’t say shut up :(
I love the Filet O'Fish! McDonald's tartar sauce is the absolute best. 😂 Pro tip. Get the sausage and egg McGriddle without cheese. It makes all the difference!
I dont understand how the mcgriddle is so low... it's the only thing I eat at mcdonalds other than hashbrowns
It smells like an offensive Yankee candle 🤣
Please more Rank the Menu!!
Keith - Miranda, Eugene - Samantha , Ned - Samantha, Zac - Carrie
Keith: You eat one.  You’re like I want another. You finish the second, you feel baaad.  So true Keith. So true! 😂😂😂
My 3 year old daughter loves McDonald's hotcakes. She's gonna be devastated to hear she's been wrong for years..
HELL YEAH
Eugene: (Usually takes himself and his causes and art quite seriously) Eugene: (Is partnered with Keith) *"Cowabunga it is."*
omg im a mcgriddler
My dad’s name is Frank. Please don’t say that 😂
This was a super fun Collab.  Please do some more. I thoroughly enjoyed this.
Eugene throwing little punches at Keith's arm THE CUTEST THING EVER
Cu
I miss the plastic mcflurry cups so much. This paper rework is dumb, you can't even close it! And its smaller, no size choice. And where i live the price increased for no reason.
Love love love this episode!!!! Please do more of these collabs!!
It took me a long time to warm up to Eugene. But now, he is my favorite.
They should've ranked the strawberry and banana smoothie
The only good thing about the McGriddle is that it tastes the same coming up as it does going down. 😂
Keith: "egg mcmuffin" Eugene: "manamurnamur"
I feel like they should do one with just Dairy Queen Blizzards
Hot cakes are top 3!!!
OMG THE RANKING GOD IS BACK
this cross over is great thank you but eugene needs the beard and mustache back thanks
Come back to Australia! We have always deep fried the apple pies!
Absolutely love these guys. Gotta get Eugene on Top 5 Beatdown to expand the TGCU
You basteds made me crave a Big Mac and I’ve never even tried one. I still love you though. 💙💜
did i hear that correctly- who in their right mind puts ranch on ICE CREAM?? oh my god.
Ohhh Rank King is Baaack!
I want Keith to become the next Nikocado Avocado.
THE TREE lmao omg Eugene
now imagine if they did this stoned
I greatly appreciate the censoring of the many cum's you threw out there. My 9 year old came over to watch and would have had so many questions I did NOT want to answer lol
Eugene, twitter does not take kindly to youtubers making jokes involving animals you gotta be careful
Maybe not a fast food chain but it would be fun to see Keith and Eugene rank their favorite restaurants and see what they both like and dislike
This video is so fun! The guys are being silly friends, the food-drunkness, the judging, it’s all amazing. I can literally eat nothing from McDonald’s and yet I will watch the video many times over.
boys, I gotta say, the maccas menu here in australia, in terms of spicy chicken, is far supreme. you gotta try the mcspicy if you get the chance, its a fucking delicacy. also the crispy deluxe is pretty good but eh
It's so funny to see them slowly go crazy with the amount of food and grease they eat
Also when you're eating the plain burger  you're supposed to drink coke with is as you're chewing it. Makes it taste even better.
The video i never knew I wanted until now! Please do more!
WTF where are the egg burritos???
Please more rank the menu
MY FAVE DUO
The McGriddle requires someone with a mature palate to appreciate the galaxy of flavors in it.
I love the Rank the Menu concept and we don't usually get a lot of just Eugene and Keith videos. I would definitely be into watching a lot more of this series. Keep up the great work Try Team <3 Love You Lots Like Tater Tots <3
I don’t appreciate the pancake slander 😔
They got more fucked up on McDonalds than they did in the weed episode.
My order from McDonald's is a mcdouble   with Mac sauce.  I also get a side so I can do my own version of wild style fries.
Putting the nuggets in first place is the worst thing I’ve ever seen happen 🧿👄🧿 there nuggets are the worst out of every fast food chain so they have no right to be at the top of the list
I loved this! Would love to see more rank the menus! Y’all are hilarious together!
The collab I didn’t know I needed.
Filet o fish are underated
I loved this
The collab we've all been waiting for
Kieth: “When I’m drunk I want to eat a rotisserie chicken.”  McDonald’s: starts selling Mctisserie chickens
The BEST duo.
How pleasing it was to hear Eugene refer to the pancake as injera - rolls have been flipped
Love Keith's sauce,mainly the chicken one.. shocked when my son got it cause we are in Alaska and lot of things they won't ship here. So I am glad he got it cause they are tasty 👍
The apple pie they make now sucks, I miss the original fried apple pie. It was so good! 😭
Keith is the best!  It seems like Eugene gets his spark back when he is paired with Keith.
Morons I disagree
❤️❤️❤️
Why is the McChicken so small? Glad to see the McFlurry rank well!
Where are you getting a hash brown for a dollar, all the MCd's around me charge 2.19 for one
Definitely another “rank the menu”.
Love the combination of eat the menu and rank king.
The quarter pounder >>>>>
Ranch <3
You gotta put the hash brown in the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle!!!!
actually fries have sugar in it.
justice for the sausage mcgriddle
They should've gotten the original honey cup for the nuggets.
No chicken burger from McDonalds will beat the McSpicy. You can get it in Singapore and other parts of Asia?
22:13 that's because they cook it fresh now, its raw meat for the Quarter Pounders
Bell ball bone boot. Silly Try Guys.
And you didn't get a breakfast burtito!!!! SMDH. For shame.
Welcome back Eugene Im glad you brought an unhinged energy with you
I work at a McDonald's I been working on becoming a manager I have a few comments. I'm sorry about your experience with the crispy chicken sandwich it shouldn't have been dry I believe that they held it in the cabinet past the hold time. I recommend for that and everything I order is ask for cook to order. I'm a closer so at the end of the night I cook to order for 2 to 3 hours before we close for every order it's a lot harder with being short stafted but it's worth it knowing the food customers get is at its freshes plus to be honest it helps with the restaurant waste counter. And the soft serve I'm a little confused maybe the store I work at is different but it's one machine one side does the ice cream like the cones and Sundays and the other side does the milk shakes sorry getting off topic but the ice cream machine is down so much because of ether it's being cleaned for safety reasons like I wouldn't want to serve you ice cream with a possibility of it containing expired ice cream mix the other reason is the machine brakes a lot idk why that's just what I realized. I hope that it gets redesigned to stop breaking. And the mcflurry straw is designed like that to go on to a machine that uses the straw to mix it together. Also don't hold me to it I haven't made a breakfast item sense before covid when we still made some breakfast at night. There is 3 different eggs there's folded eggs, there's liquid egg whites that we cook in a round dish, there one that's a cracked egg that we cook in a round dish
How you gonna review McDonald's breakfast and eat NO SAUSAGE ITEMS?? Party foul. I call BS.
Next time put syrup on the chicken nugget pancake taco, that could be good! Lol
middle children of the big mac rise
Omggg is it a crossover😍😍
the final boss is eat the menu at Cheesecake Factory their menu is so big it has chapters
21:30 The 1/3 pound burger failed because people thought a 1/4 was bigger, because 4 is bigger than 3
They may call that Canadian ham, but our ham is back bacon/peameal bacon/Canadian bacon
I’m so happy the Filet O Fish was given some respect. My mom was a health freak so I would only be allowed to get the Filet O Fish at McDonalds 😂 It’s so good and it gives me nostalgia
Its so interesting to see this McDonald's ranking compared to the original made by Keith, you can see how much production has grown since then
Put a hash brown and a big Mac
“This is top tier. This is Shinee Tier (15:37)”  I didn’t know Eugene was a Shawol.
love the way y'all mismatch the cushions in the back
"They'd trick Becky with that for sure...." I laughed so hard. 🤣 poor Becky... I love Keith and Becky!
You missed the best McDonald's breakfast item, the sausage burrito
Burger companies have tried to make 1/3 pounder burgers for years, but people think they are getting ripped off compared to a 1/4 because 3 is less than 4. America is a land of idiots.
They really started the video with 'fuck buzzfeed'
McDonald’s just came out with menu hacks can you please do an episode with all the weird combinations they’ve come out with on their app. Please pretty please
I feel underwhelmed by your chicken burgers! In Denmark, we have the Chicken Salsa Cheese, which is my fave!
You guys could do a rank the menu type video but with everyone’s favorite fast food/restaurant item/meal from different places. Then see who has the best taste in the office lol
I'm always here for Rank King and Eat the Menu content, so if this gets me more episodes, yes. Yes.
Why does keith sound drunk
"In the Before times... at the Before place"
What do we think Eugene and Keith were saying that had to be censored? Balls? Bussy? 😂
I didn't think the Pope of all people would get roasted in this video. But hey I'm a catholic raised italian turned atheist so I agree with Keith. Also yes our churches are fucking gorgeous
Wait, did Eugene go on a rant about something smelling like pussy? Because I looked up the Bradford Pear tree, and apparently it smells like rotting fish. If so, not cool. That lame joke about vagina's smelling like fish is some misogynistic bs. I thought better of you Eugene.
You guys need to do tims!!!!!!
MCGRIDDLES’ sweet, salty, soft and crunchy wetness deserved to be higher. They are the 5-in-1 we can accept.
Honestly, there is a newer franchising fast-food place that I have been thinking would be perfect for a Keith and Eugene eat/rank the menu – Holdaak. It started in Fullerton and has been expanding through the Orange County and LA areas, and it sells Korean fried chicken; almost feels meant to be. :)
Grogu agrees with chicky nuggies being #1, but I rank FRESH french fries #1
RANK THE MENU,
The filet o fish is always assembled so it’s half off the bun , with half a cheese cliche and little tartar sauce. Are McDonald workers told to have it be half off the bun?
Please do a Keith eats Trader Joe's
Big Mac, McFlurry, fries and apple pie is my favorite
Keugene ftw!!!
YAHOO! i love this series <3
I love how Keith takes big bites, and Eugene takes baby bites. I just find that interesting.
Yes please :) Rank the menu is quite enjoyable
I love that there are in fact no McGriddle stans in the comments because those people don’t exist. 😂
bun seed sesame a on onions pickles cheese lettuce sauce special patties beef all two
Keith's mustache makes me sad
Eugeith
I love how chaotic the whole video is 😂
nuggies, fries, and the Double Cheese are the 3 things I buy most
The most wholesome video ever! I had no idea i needed this type of collab! More of these videos please and keep ranking :)
Justice for the McDonald’s hotcakes
🤩
I 100% go to McDonald's specifically for the Hot Cakes. And no... you're wrong.
Mcchickens are so much better with tomato cheese and Buffalo 😗
round of applause for Sara Ann Dipidous (it's greek)
McNut Cake
You guys have so Much note stuff than we Do here on Québec !!!
I don’t know why but worst on the right and best on the left feels wrong
Alright I'm gonna say it: Eugene is high AF
I’m In Ontario Canada my favourite breakfast is the breakfast burrito
Is it just me or are the subs too fast compared to the actual voicing xD
is the hot sauce only online? id have a better time finding it at the store than waiting on shipping time
Making the fillet-o-fish was my least favourite fucking job! The buns are steamed so taking them out you always burnt your hands and then you had to rip the cheese in half and I still have no idea why??? Plus you would have to waste the other half since nobody orders them that often.
"We're never doing this again" ill see yall in two weeks where they rank the menu burger king :)
as someone who worked at mcdonald’s get the mcchicken with no mayo no lettuce as ketchup and diced onions 10000 times better
Where’s the sausage McMuffin?
29:55 you're welcome 😂
Let's another one please. Let's do series
More rank king please I miss Eugene
Definitely need more of this, Rank the Menu.
The fact that Eugene said the McGriddle was a "strange culinary experience" after all of his shenanigans on without a recipe is hilarious 😂
I know it’s not McDonald’s, but at BK in Calais ME, they have a bacon sundae.
watching this just proves to me that mcdonald's have better food outside the US
eugene lee yang catholic icon
Kugene is here to stay! We definitely need more Rank the Menu episodes!!
*watches as eating Mcdonalds breakfast*
I can’t stop commenting bc this video is gold. 💀… the fact that Keith ate a double QP with cheese at like 9 makes me feel better for having my mom order me 3 double cheeseburgers off of the dollar menu at that age. 😂💀
Egg McMuffin is the only thing they still crack an egg for ..everything else is boxed eggs lol
The bacon egg and cheese bagel is superior and I’m so sad they didn’t try it
Wait did they purposely dress to match the pillows?…💛❤️
there is beef powder on the fries
Uhhh where was the steak egg and cheese bagel?!?!!
My favorite duo. Keith is also the only try guy who makes Eugene laugh the most ❤️
The round egg (a real egg) is made fresh, the square egg ( pre-made egg can’t say it’s real) is frozen can can be thrown in the microwave and most times is if they are busy 🙃. I don’t recommend  Fries are soaked in milk before the flash freeze it’s the secret to why they are so good  Also it cracks me up that people don’t have a frishes they have this but it’s got tarter sauce so much better
yeah the hot cakes are good when your 5 before you try bk's french toast sticks and i'm weirdo usually gets strawberry jam to dip them in. and you two hilarious together. Filet o fish is good but has to be eaten fresh if not colder it gets worse it gets just like you know fries need be eaten hot to mcdonalds has some of those foods where as with hashbrown can be eaten cold as can big mac they still good cold.
petition to redo the other place🤢 eat the menus you did the rank king himself!!
Justice for McGriddles!!!
A McDouble, dressed as a Mac, is good, as well
Injera? INJERA??? You’re done….you’re done. 😂
For me is the mc chicken. The besta best chicken sandwiche.
Please eat the hot fudge with friessssss 😋 🤤 🤤 😋
"You know the one thing they left that survived the nuclear wars?"  You're close, Eugene, but it's the french fries that fall between the car seats. 1,000 years from now they'll still be there. Pristine. Perfect. Flawless.
This was so fun hahahahaha
I need like 100 more of these videos this was the best thing I’ve ever seen
15:55 who is the creepy shadow in the background?
Keith and Eugene collabing is what I needed in my life
What is up with you Keith and Eugene doing a video together? But it was well worth it and I would love to see another one of some kind!!
Again again
I've never tried the McChicken...but that's because in Texas we have the Hot N Spicy chicken sandwich. Which is basically the McChicken but hot, sort of... I was kind of surprised to find out that's not on all McDonald's menus
i love the pancakes 🥺🥺
I love you two together! Best Collab ever! 💙💙💙💙💙
Egg Mcmuffin egg is just a egg cracked right out of the shell and cooked It's the most unprocessed thing at McDonald's
"Could be beef." Great SNL reference, Eugene! XD
This did not disappoint!
How could someone not like a McGriddle…. But because it’s Eugene now I’m wondering if I actually like a McGriddle… but I love the McGriddle…..
Can we get an updated most iconic 50 States Drinks video with Eugene??? It may not be possible be I love it. Thank you to Keith for constantly putting himself through Eat The Menu for us. ❤️
Love this style of video! Keith and Eugene teaming up is epic 🥰
please do more of these rank the menus i beg
How dare you insult the mcgriddle like that.
When u guys come to Singapore again, try the macdonald menu here! What is popular here is filet o fish actually haha. And our own items like Mcspicy. We also have seasonal items like sumarai burger, nasi lemak burger and recently the chicken rice burger. Oh and we have curry sauce!
EUG-IETH
eugene don’t shame me for eating the mcgriddle and other stuff!! it’s SO GOOD
Eating Everything from McDonald’s (Keith’s version)
Personally I'd like more rank the menu, this was fun
10:15 you get a like for that statement
Yessss, perfect video to watch while eating weekend McDonald's 🥰
I really appreciate how they color coordinated their clothes to match each other and the pillows with McDonald's themed colors. ♥️
Keith needs a heating lamp for these.  Temperature is a part of how food is consumed properly.   You cant have a hot ice cream or frozen burgers and expect a proper judgement.   Help daddies favorite out
They are correct different eggs one is cracked in a circle mold and cooked on a grill and the other egg is a pre whisked egg that is cooked the same but in a rectangle to be folded
I'm so high and I just shouted "this is genius marketing!!!" Idk..
Imagine a Jackbox Rank the Menu. That’d be so hard to watch lol
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before
In 1976 I used to get a double cheeseburger fries and a shake for $1.29
Ironic how this is a McDonald’s video when I get an ad about Burger King….💀
We need more and more of these two together.  Love their synergy!!!
Eugene thinks that we have to re murder the cow to get cheese instead of just milking it such a Texan haha
please this was a great video
i like the folded egg better!
They forgot the Hot N Spicy
McGriddle is prime for my breakfast choice every time.
Eugene.... I'm also from/in Texas and I'm not a big ranch dressing fan either.
As someone who hasn’t eaten McDonalds in years out of pure disgust and hatred for McDonalds and everything it represents, if you put a McGriddle, Hashbrowns or a Flurry in front of me right now, I’m going to eat them. MsGriddles are so chaotic yet brilliant to me. It’s just those damn syrup infused pancake buns. Whose idea was that? The Hashbrowns are literally perfect no debate and the McFlurrys only flaw is that the damn machine is always broken.
As a former worker of McDonald’s, the breakfast is by far the grossest part of McDonald’s
The McDonald’s crispy chicken sandwich literally makes me sick every time I try it. 0/10 do not recommend, save your GI Tracy the pain.
The captions are out of sync.
Rank the menu was awesome
Do not put awful shit taco lettuce on the filet o fish nor any other lettuce.  Lettuce is a trash addition used to supplement other toppings except in a BLT or burger
The serendipitous bit was hilarious 😂
"avengers endgame is the most ambitious crossover" okay so you've obviously never seen this video
petition to make this a continous series 🙋🏻‍♀️
Why does american fast food always look so sad?
Great video! I wonder if the Try Guys will consider ranking different fast-food chains on the food they have in common, like fries, burgers etc in one video. Not their more unique foods. Like a fast-food competition ranking. I love the McDonald's hashbrowns but what I love even more is the potato cakes at Arby's. Which they have sadly recently discontinued. My mom & I were so enraged I wrote to them through their website that it was one of the best non-sandwich things they had and the only other fast-food place that had anything like it was McDonald's and their hashbrowns. It was more unique to Arby's, and I like the Arby's potato cake more than Mc D's hashbrowns simply because they're thicker. What did Arby's replace it with? FRIES. Why?! Every place has fries. I'd happily pay more for them if they brought them back. I just want to end this comment saying while I love their sandwiches I haven't been back to Arby's since they discontinued their potato cakes. And it will probably stay that way for quite a while, but we'll see 😒😮‍💨
That thing on the half pounder vs double quarter pounder is actually kind of true. A&W had a 1/3 lb burger that was cheaper than the quarter pounder, but people didn't buy it cause they thought they were getting less food
Such a spunky episode
im so glad i lived long enought to witness events like this
Let me just say -the flashback to the first TG video reminded me of how much of a glow up each of these men have had. 🥵
You missed the breakfast burrito! It's my fave!
This episode was amazing. They should do more food episodes together. For sure one of my favorite videos 🥰
More rank the menu! We want morrreeee!!!!!!!!!
They literally wore red and yellow like macdonalds OMG
I love you guys
We need more of rank the menu 🔥🔥
Honestly, Mcgriddle should be top 5 and maybe hash browns is moved up to 1 and this ranking is pretty accurate. I only get that food dopamine hit while eating some fresh french fries, hash browns(the best) or fresh out of the fryer mcnuggests so top 3 is solid. Ironically they are also the 3 worst foods if there not fresh.
Insane that I got a Burger King ad halfway through the video
The subs are 2 seconds too fast lol. But I enjoyed the video.💜
YES THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED
Fun Fact: McDonald’s has a partnership with coke and the coke is sent in metal containers for that there is more carbonation in it and they use a different syrup so it tastes better. As well as the bags being switched out more, that is my Mcdonald’s soda has such differences from the regular canes.
This was super fun! I’d love to see more Rank the Menu
i love how we can all agree that you can only have one hashbrown or else you'll feel gross but it's still the best
obviously more rank the menu pls
"We won't do this again. Unless this video does really well." *Likes and comments IMMEDIATELY*
Love this
Rank the Menu sounds great
You probably had it while you were here in Australia, our McChicken is on the quarter pounder bun and the small McChicken is called a chicken and cheese (no lettuce, but a slice of cheese instead on the hamburger bun)
the jr chicken in Canada is elite, I have heard so many Americans complain about the McChicken but its counterpart up here is literally heavenly
I love this one, and I don’t normally comment BUUUTTTTT my name is SAREN like Saren-dipitous…. Anyway love you guys!!!!
I'm surprised they got the fish on the bun tbh iykyk
I will defend the hell out of the McGriddle. Primarily because it takes me back to the need for a quick breakfast in high school. As well as because it was one of those things where I was judged for eating each layer individually.
No one: Keith: “when I’m drunk, I like to eat a rotisserie chicken”
But they must do it again 😭
is it just me or the substitles kinda a lil bit faster ? im sorry english is not my first language so it’d be helpful is you guys fix it. Thank youuu
Something about the growing pile of McDonald’s on Keith’s side is so funny to me. I wish McDonald’s would bring back the wraps and chicken tenders. 😭 Everything else hurts my stomach.
More Eugene/Keith videos please! Their chemistry is gold!
Another one!! Eugene has elevated eat the menu!! Eat the menu with Keith and co-stars will never be the same.
Keith does not look good at the end of that video 🤢🤢🤢🤢
it's the *color coordination* between their shirts and the pillows behind them for me 🤌🏽
I want moreeeeeeeee
I don't know if it's still the case, but when I worked at McDonald's many years ago the hotcakes were pre-made frozen "pancakes" that were thawed out and microwaved. They are truly awful and I don't know how anyone could like them.
AWWWWWE
I love by the end of every video where Keith eats alot of food his voice gets huskier and sleepier lol. You just know by the end it's gonna happen. All my love from Michigan ❤️
Great video! Your videos always make me smile! Y’all are so funny 😄💛
This was fun I love the 2 if u together
Do I want another video where Keith and Eugene decide whether something tastes better or worse than c**? Absolutely!
This video is proof that The Try Guys love us and want us to be happy. 🥰
There is no before
YESSSS!!! My favorite Try Duo
No respect for Hot Cakes or the McGriddle, objectively two of their best products.  :(
😆the bell, the boot, the ball & the blob
I haven’t had them in a while but I remember thinking McDonald’s nuggets were awful. I was a Wendy’s nuggets Stan all the way.
This and the weed trivia video are both Top Tier. The editing, the acting, the Vibes. Good stuff.
Yellowjackets was such a wild amazing show. Love that the try guys watch too
Is Eugene referencing an SNL skit with Maya, Kristen and Bill at 8:21? Because that's where my mind immediately went to! PURE COMEDY GOLD
i love keith and eugene videos bc it forces keith who is usually the chaotic one to reign in eugene who can and will go off the rails at a moments notice lmao
Keiths bites are ginormous compared to Eugenes
idk if it's still the same as it was during my first job in the late 90s, but the egg mcmuffin eggs were always real eggs that you'd crack from the shells, all the other eggs were liquid scramble that you'd cook, but like everything else, they get rewarmed so that might be why the texture is weird.  i don't think you ever had a fried apple pie because at least as of 1998 they were baked, and i don't think they were fried since at least the 80s if not earlier.
I feel like ranch culture is one of those things where poc look at white people and ask "y'all good"?
Is the Bradford Pear the same as the linden tree? They smell like…you know…the thing that Keith and Eugene said they smell like. 🤣🤣 watch That Mitchell and Webb Look for a great sketch, that illustrates this exact point. 🤣
I had to stop watching and stare a wall for a while after learning mcchicken is 1 dollars there and everything is so expensive where I live that I can’t even afford the mcchicken easily and have never tried other things (especially the ones with beef since they are even more expensive) and thought mcchicken was the best thing ever until now...
How about eating everything from the menu of an Indian restaurant near by?
I’m gonna call it now that this is gonna be a very successful show and Eugene will begrudgingly have to eat while menus more with Keith, I love seeing their dynamic on screen!
this video has done v well. dont stop please haha
i feel like eugene is completely unhinged in this video & I LOVE IT 😂
I never really went to mcdonalds, on the episode of fast food trivia when Keith said that McDonalds was his favourite fast food was McDonalds I was confused, so I tried mcDonalds for the very first time in years and didn't get it. Now watching this video I realized that I'm from Portugal, in Europe and our Mc is just shit, like the "bigmac" was the same size of a happy meal burguer
it's incredible how awful american mcdonald's looks compared to in other countries, i had forgotten just how bad it was :s
i feel like pancake taco w nuggets would be better w syrup instead of ranch, like wayyyy better
The mc griddle is the second best food at mc D 's
Omg crossover episode
rank king and eat the menu at the same time???? girlll dreams do come true
I am live commenting my thoughts. So stay tuned. 1) This is everything I ever wanted in life. 2) I love nuggets but they do not top fries, I'm sorry. 3) Is Ranch a Texas thing??? I grew up in Maryland and I am obsessed with 2 condiments: ranch and old bay. I put them both on EVERYTHING (savory except for the one ice cream flavor at the Charmery which has old bay in it and that is the one good old bay dessert). 4) "a lot of companies started with really bad stuff... Like Us!" you're not wrong but my loyalty to y'all feels hurt by this. 5) "sometimes forgotten but greatly appreciated once you understand the function" really hit home as a fellow middle child.  6) they changed their apple pie recipe at some point and it's just not the same anymore... 7) KEITH. They specifically gave our FREE caramel brownie mcflurries AS AN APOLOGY FOR EVERYONE WHO THOUGHT THE SPOON WAS A STRAW, HAHAHAHAHA. It was a whole marketing thing!! 8) It's just so funny to watch someone else experience the actual things Keith puts himself through on Eat the Menu. Like we always have guests but they're not there for the full time, so seeing another try guy go "i'm so delirious" made me happy because finally someone sees Keith's pain, hahahaha. 9) For the first time ever, I think I agree with the rankings, haha
The fish sandwich from Burger King is top tier
No one can argue that chicken nuggets reigns supreme.
forgot this video was about mcdonalds when it turned into a yellowjackets ad in the first 4 minutes
Are they doing one vid a week now?
Hi hello yes McGriddle Stan here ✋🏽 that little sandwich gives you the best of everything breakfast has to offer and the fact that it’s ranked so low is quite frankly demeaning 🥲
this is the best thing I’ve seen
Please do so many more Keith and Eugene RTMs!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I didn't realize they present the item/food the same way until today 😅 And these two have my favorite individual segments lol
"I'm right. You're wrong. Open wide."
In Sweden its a hole slice of cheese on the felet-o-fish.
I have always said those Bradford Pear trees smell like c*m!! It's so nauseating. 🤮
How old is Keith? 9 cent hamburgers? For a day? I remember the Wednesday and Sunday 79 cent hamburger and 89 cent cheeseburger..
I love this episode..rank the menu...i need more
Seeing McNuggets ranked first made me so proud, like a mom whose kid just got into Harvard.
I’m in love with the (McDonald’s) ketchup and mustard colored shirts and pillows!
28:11 something bout Kieth saying apple pie like that
The idea of the McChicken being so high is troubling 🤢
I am deeply saddened by the lack of the breakfast burrito but mostly because I’m afraid they’re going to go away if they’re not popular and they’re the thing I always crave the most from McDonald’s! Paired with a hashbrown? Bliss.
Just because I love you guys, Why are we only getting one video a week? Not complaining about the great content just wish I had a little morsel in the middle of the week of Try guy content to look forward too.
Seeing bacon, egg and cheese in what looks like a scone is wild
I guess I need to watch Yellowjackets
Eugene Lee Yang: Famous Internet Catholic 🙏🏻
God, I missed Rank King
This reminds me of December when I went Christmas shopping. I shopped all over this shopping district 5th St. Highway which is a VERY long road filled with shops and fast food restaurants. I was on the first day of my period and I was craving Mickey D's. I was on my way to Walmart by bus which is on the end of 5th St. Highway. The only Mickey D's I remembered I passed earlier. I started to cry ON THE BUS because I was craving Mickey D's SO MUCH! I looked out the window when the bus arrived at Walmart and saw a MICKEY D'S NEXT TO WALMART! I reacted like I won the billion dollar lottery right then and there. At a HUGE feast when I got there and ate the food REALLY fast within 10 minutes. Not my proudest moment.
The specific chaos of a Keith Eugene collab is everything we ever wanted🤩🤪
The fact that my 2 go tos: nuggest and double cheese burger are so high is validating
Also put mcchicken on the double cheese burger. Mcgangbang...
I've come to love the Big Mac more this pandemic for some reason. So it coming 4th is a welcome surprise!
firmly believe the pancake chicken taco could actually be good w/ the hotcake syrup instead of ranch!
the yellow/red shirt-pillow coordination is excellent, on brand mcdo. Very impressed
We need a rank of frozen pizza!
The apple pie looks like a Gregg's sausage roll.
Apple pie much better with frying
Big mac with quarter pounders burgers are the best
Not including a Sausage McMuffin with Egg is a true travesty.
The collab we most definitely needed
You should do a Culver’s eat the menu!
"we both have the same show basically"
Yes more of this. Make this a series please
The Eat the Menu X Rank King Crossover we all needed
Double cheeseburger and mcnuggets are what I get. Great ranking.
Love this crossover!!!
McChicken better be below F tier, it makes all their chicken products look worse
Got an ad for McD halfway through the video 😂
Can we get a Wendys Rank the menu!
Please do this again! The crossover event we didn’t know we needed
"And they used to fry them, now they bake them" - Very stoned looking Keith, but don't worry he's just full on dah dah dah da dah..that M. @28:54
.
i loved this crossover!! we need more keith and eugene content i love them as a duo... especially high off fast food
Its going to be a lengthy post here. ‼️ I worked for mcds for 7 years(quit in August of 2021), the list is pretty accurate when it comes to sales, mcgriddles should be higher tho. (above the fish filet) I know it was 20 items, but they should have added the breakfast bagel sandwiches(it has the steak meat) and should have made the hotcakes into the breakfast deluxe; its hotcakes with scrambled eggs, (different from the folded egg from the mcgriddle) biscuit, sausage and hashbrown. Finally, about the ice cream machine, that machine is so delicate. If it has too much shake mix it will lock down, if it has too little shake mix it will lock down, if you don't clean the machine properly it will lock down. If we start running out of shake mix and people keep asking for ice cream we have to stop selling ice cream for the machine to not lock down. If it locks down it will take days to unlock and you have to call maintenance to help you out. It was a nightmare.
Fudge is real chocolate. The way it's prepared determines whether or not it hardens in colder temperatures
This idea was brilliant. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Watching Eugene gain a new respect for the trauma that Keith goes through during eat the menu is beautiful
Egg Texture. That was my high school band name.
I’m done with Popeyes chicken sandwich. It’s kind of too much for me a 5’10 man. Too much flavor. Chick-fil-A is just right though. Great balance. Gonna try kfc sandwich next time.
I always eat a Big Mac with extra sauce XD and in those drunken moments...Big Mac, Mozzarella sticks, and chicken nuggets with ranch. yum yum
Keith. I love you, nonromantically. You're my second favorite try guy (Eugene is my favorite)..but what is with the mustache? Are you ever gonna shave it?
OMG, as a recovering Catholic, this video was 🔥🤣
The pancakes are the best thing at McDonalds I’m sorry
I reference the warthog line way too much lol My bf who is lactose intolerant loves the sundaes at McDonald's cause it's not real dairy. So that's our ice cream date 😂
literwlly waiting on my mcdonald’s skip order 😂😂🤦‍♀️ then i see this! nice hahahaa
About time try guys have a good video
Keith and Eugene are the best try guys combos!
sorry guys, this was too good. you're doing this again . . . and again .... and again
Their clothes and the pillows behind them...
So far I have only seen two items get ranked, but as a former Mc Donalds employee, I have to spill the secrets. We serve three kinds of eggs for breakfast. on the egg McMuffins we serve round egg which is out the shell eggs we crack ourselves. on the biscuits, we serve "folded egg" wish is a package of about 9 little egg patties that we warm-up. for the breakfast and long-forgotten bagels we used scrambled eggs which was a carton on egg mix that was poured into a mold on the stove and shaken to get the scrambled egg look.  edit: I agree with Keith the McGriddle is awesome. with the caveat that is the only food that ever made me puke while working there.
Eugene and Keith try McDonald’s secret menu items 🥺
I was with Eugene until he placed the hamburger at the bottom. I know he’s the RanKing, but I heartily disagree
He should of put syrup on the chicken pantaco it would of been 🔥
When they said mc chicken it was clearly a jr chicken
this video made me order McDonald's omg
I'm a proud mcgriddler thank you for the representation Keith 🙏❤
Crazy.. the mcgrundle is the best!
Yay I like seeing eugene! Keith you’re like the decorative flowers.
I don't care what it is they do, Eugene and Keith is just a dream duo. I loved that one fever dream, 70s style talk show vid they did.
Since the spiderverse, this is the best crossover of the century
We need to talk about how Johnathan is always at the ready with facts. He knows proper wine bottle labels & c*m trees.
When is the next without a recipe season?
Lol who the fuck goes to mcdonalds for the nostalgia? It's a toxic slop of overprocessed cheap shit, and the only reason anyone I know eats there is because we literally can't afford anything better. JFC idk why it made me so angry to hear that. (Maybe because I can't afford actual healthy food and have no choice but to eat this shit if I don't want to starve.)
Hash browns have not been 2x$1 in years 😂. McDonald’s doesn’t even have a dollar menu any more.
My university was filled with those trees!! There was always someone who would mention it when we would walk by😂😂
I love how Eugene didn’t call anything what it was. Not even for hotcakes/pancakes 😂
How is that you guys haven't rented or purchased a heat lamp?...... 🤔
"you finish the second one you feel bad" said right as i finished my second one and indeed, i am now feeling bad
This is a fantastic idea! I remember a show where Keith and Eugene were paired, Eugene wondering why they weren't paired very often ; Keith: Because we're BOTH the best! It wouldn't be FAIR!!  This Ranking/Eat the Menu collab was SO much fun!! Do it again, please!
YAYYY THE TWO KINGS TY
Justice for the McGriddle! If I could only eat one thing at McDonalds forever, it would be the sausage McGriddle. Even over the fries and nuggets!
My step dad drowns stuff he eats in condiments, like... I wanna say at least an 8th of a cup, maybe more, and he throws half of it out, but it's so much condiment that it smells. I can't stand it it makes me wanna throw up.
The only McGriddle I can go for is the chicken one. It's terrible. It's a cheap fried chicken slurry in between two pieces of foam rubber soaked in fake syrup. I can't not get it.
You know Ned was so hurt when Eugene said Keith was “the Carrie”
I really really really need Keith to do The Catchelor
Bell, ball, boot and bone🐔
The crossover nobody knew we needed…GENIUS. Eugene sounded so good when he sang spontaneously. I want more of Eugene singing. Love that these 2 sound progressively drunker with everything they ate. Let’s have a video of Eugene sticking needles into Keith while pouring water on him 😂😂
What about the breakfast burrito?
this made my entire day bless yall
I never knew I needed rank the menu so much in my life!!!
Releasing the video before lunch (EST anyways) was very cruel...
Eugene: “If I had a chicken, I’d just be sucking on that butt.” 😂 Oh, Eugene, how I have missed you
Brooo imagine having the munchies and eating a McDonald’s hash brown ANDDD a Big Mac😩😩😩😍
do more of these. this was great!
summarize the old video:  Keith eats so much his voice gets weirdly deeply.
Can you rank Pokemon please? There are so many good categories of ranking! Thanks! Lol
It's the combination of "open wide" and the recurrent c*m jokes that gets me. 🤣🤣🤣
I appreciate that this video is just a sneaky way to promote Yellowjackets.
Finally!🥳 They listened to us. Omg that means we are gonna see Zach & Matt cooking together?
Petition for McDonalds to bring back the Rolo McFlurry!
so Whataburger ranking
This is literally one of the best videos we could have asked for, more please!!!!
Been so long, but to see Eugene and Keith is absolutely amazing! 🥰
This was the crossover I needed lol
Keith being on Eugene's Rank Show is quite entertaining. Also, get a Quarter Pounder with cheese, add Mac Sauce and lettuce. No ketchup and mustard.
The chicken sandwiches in the UK mcds are way better than the ones you guys were eating. Yikes
“Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic.” 💀
I want to know how they get their bread buns stretchy and slightly waterproof.
Yes for more Rank the Menu! Love the Keigune energy. :)
This is absolutely one of my favorite episodes of the try guys. It's hard for me to watch a whole eat the menu normally, but when you add in Eugene and ranking things, I could watch them rank things all day long.
I hope this does well lol
the crossover we never expected
Ok, you toddlers have NO idea what you're talking about. I worked at McD's back in the day when most of these Sammies were new. You didn't try the breakfast burrito, which is quite decent, the addition of bacon on the quarter pounder is genius, the filet-o- fish used to have lettuce on it, and the original desserts (apple & cherry pies) we're FRIED! You could also count the cherries in each pie- any amount over 4 complete cherries was jackpot! Not to mention the mini cinnamon rolls, heated, with pats of butter...the bomb! Big breakfasts we're also with royalty (pancakes, scrambled eggs, and a sausage patty). So I respectfully disagree with your rankings. The food has changed too much to accurately rank it. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. (Your ranking of the hash brown was correct).
I love how they match with those cushions!
When I was in elementary school I would ride my bike to McDonalds to get the Tuesday 29c hamburger or Wednesday 39c cheeseburger for me and my sister.
This was excellent. *chefs kiss*. The crossover we didn’t deserve, but the crossover we all needed.
As an Australian - I do not understand the McGriddle. I ate one and the texture was confusing. I agree with Eugene
Clearly Keith doesn't eat McDonald's...$1 for a hash brown? Try like $1.70 now.
i’ve never, ever been happier!!!!!
Why did I watch this whole thing? Lol
When I’m drunk I wanna eat a rotisserie chicken. I’m 💀
You guys look like mustard and ketchup together with your shirt combos😂💛❤️
Loved the Super Showcase SNL skit reference 😂 Solid reference and impersonation. “It could be beef…”
they should do an unfiltered thing bc like i have an idea of what there saying but like i need for sure
Not to be a Karen, but the background music was a bit too loud. It could easily drown out what the guys were saying. Just my input for future edits!
I'm low-key disappointed that you didn't make a "McGangbang" by putting the mcdouble & mcchicken together 😒
More of these please!!
This should have been Keith’s ranking and then have Eugene close ranks
The duo weve been waiting for!!! Love you guys!!! Miss the two a week! 😫😫😫
the best crossover we've been waiting for
A rank the tea with zach
I just watched 5 seconds of it and I can already tell that this video will be marvelous, entertaining, funny and great. This is a video we all have been waiting for and we finally got. Thanks to everybody who made it possible to make this video.
How many times has Eugene called himself a bottom princess?
that william h macy joke was gold 😂
the only difference between a mcdouble and double cheese burger is 1 slice of cheese
Eugene seems to be forever lowering the tone of your videos guys there is no need for his smutty attempt at being funny I'm not saying this because I'm  homophobic or have any ill-will towards him in any shape or form, in fact it's the opposite I have a lot of respect for him and I think he's better than that !
we love a eugeith collab
Why is this something we needed but didn't know what we wanted
Where was the breakfast bagel sandwich?
Omg, absolutely loved this collab! :D
Okay but mcchickens deserved better
Would love to see more rank the menu videos...if that doesn't make Becky too mad😅
Sorry but a plain sausage McGriddle is the superior Macca’s brekkie sandwich, a piece of meat between two little hot cakes with syrup- salty savory perfection
Can we just talk about how genetically blessed Eugene is? His face and smile are chefs kiss 👌
Us canadians call that, Back Bacon 😂 idk why americans call it canadian bacon
why is the american mcChicken so sad?
The top 5 of the list are all I basically get 😭 I agree with the list, you guys are so entertaining as always 🥰
I had a dream Keith died and I rewatched all these and violently sobbed and i woke up in a cold sweat
Great collab!  It’s it weird that I’m OLD and I’ve never had 90% of those foods from McDonalds?!?!?!  I’ve only had the nuggets & chicken sandwich. 😬 well, and the ice cream & fries.
I hope it does super well!!!
Y’all need to eat the McDonald’s items from other countries. In here, there’s a limited time spicy garlic nugget with a smoked cheese sauce. Super crispy and the sauce tastes really nice.
Eugene’s ranch slander physically hurt me
we want MORE of rank the menu!!!
Plz make this recurring 🤣
The fact that I want McDonald’s right now is toxic haven’t eaten for 4 years or so maybe lol
Love seeing you guys together!!!
I'm obsessed with Keith and Eugene doing videos together. It's absolute chaos and I'm here for it!
I love seeing Eugene and Keith together they’re such a good team. Eugene is the king of middle children :)
RANK THE MENU!!! YES!!!!
“I have a needle in my bag.” “…” “For sewing things.”
This is a terrible thing for me to watch at 2am because now I am so. Freaking. HUNGRY. I usually don’t eat McDonalds but they make it sound so good!!
I can't believe they chose Keugene. They lost a big opportunity. Eueith was the perfect name for a series like this. Eu(gene)(K)eith
the captions are timed incorrectly :(
Oh hell naw. McDonald's Hot Cakes are THE best pancakes.
The crossover I never knew I needed
I just want someone to be as loyal to me as Keith is to the mcgriddle
When Keith said we were poor that’s why we got it sent me and the face after 😂😂😂
YES MORE RANK THE MENU PLEASE
Sweet Chili Sauce trumps all other sauces in my opinion. It was a true crime when they took it away. 😞
Eugene's HEHHEHHEH
I can’t explain myself, but I LOVE the McChicken!
Rank Taco Bell
Keith recieving what is clearly pancakes: what the f*** is this???
Eugene I usually love you but the order you picked for the breakfast sandwiches is the exact opposite of what I would’ve picked. I’m sad
You can totally tell how much bigger of a bite Keith takes of everything when eating next to Eugene.
I'm right your wrong shut up
Them ranking the McChicken so low made my heart sad
Michelle Obama did ruin food. School lunch. School lunch.
Literally take the egg and cheese off the McGriddle and it’s way better
CROSSOVER EP CROSSOVER EP WOOO
Eugene: Samantha Keith: Carrie Ned: Miranda Zach: Charlotte
Agree: the McChicken got worse.
Once travel is a thing that can happen again, you should do a Rank The Menu: Whataburger Redemption episode where you do it in Texas with actual Texan Eugene
Eugene, as a fellow Texan also traumatized by excessive ranch culture: thank you.
Idk I don’t get the McD nuggs appeal 🤷🏻‍♀️ they smell like wet dog to me…. 👀
Thank you for eating everything hope you do it again.
I haven't watched in a while and DAMN, EUGENE IS SO HAPPY NOW! Either his boyfriend is awesome or he's high. Either way, good for him!
Eugene speaking gibberish at each food announcement. Hilarious.
Keith Eats everything at McDonald's  (Keiths Version) feat. The Rank King
I’m kind of in love with this format… more please !!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the McGriddles. :(
“I do like McDonald’s soft serve” 🍦 Eugene’s line delivery 🤣🤣🤣🤣I’m dead
keith as misty-fucking-quigley is the funniest part of the whole video
As a McGriddler, it needs to be ranked higher!
Sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle is love.
What is this a crossover episode?
Don’t know if any other deaf or HoH ppl agree but the subtitles were a little fast and I couldn’t keep up! They didn’t seem to align with the guys’ lips either. Any way to have them slowed down? I appreciate that there are subtitles though, so I don’t have to rely on my declining hearing to watch some of my favourite videos :) x
I love how their outfits match the McDonald’s colors
This is a great new format! Would love if they went back to the other ETM places and ranked them
Me yelling at the tv: Dogwood! Dogwood tree! It's the Dogwood tree!!
Yellowjackets = amazing
You know who Joe is
We need a “rank king ranks Disney songs” (let it go, we don’t talk about Bruno, etc.)
Love the ketchup & mustard color coordination 😂
Looooove yellowjackets
As a habesha I appreciate Cultured King Eugene's injera reference 🥰
Eugene knows how to paint a scene 😇
Uh can we stop with bleeping out the bad words with a squeak? My dog is going insane!! Lol
Now waiting for the compilation of Eugene mumbling every food item in this video
What is this, a crossover episode? hahahh
Eugene's love of Titanic is so underrated. He needs to rank the best scenes from the movie.
This. Is. Genius
Can someone explain what Eugene said the hot cakes smelled like? I can't figure it out 😂
AHHHH RANK KING IS BACKKKKKK
I had to stop watching when Eugene started talking about c*m.... I was eating, dude.
"The before times and the before place" Gotta love subtlety
Was there scrambled egg in that McGriddle?? O.o is that an American thing?
i’ve never been this early!!!! do the try guys heart comments?
I wanna see them redo this video but keith high and Eugene either high or drunk and see if there ranking changes!
KING OF MIDDLE CHILDREN  Absolutely destroyed at Eugene holding up the food and never saying the name right on purpose. 💀 Every time I laughed! 🤣🤣  Also Keith in reference to the McChicken being $1: A bok/bawk 👏🏻👏🏻
The cross over we never thought we needed!
just wanna say i like Eugeith better.
All I can think of is Zach calling Ned NERRRRRD for the potato peeling fact 🤣
I know the come tree 🌲 they are taking about, and it 💯 % smells just like it, it has white little flowers 🌸 on it.
NO I LOVE MCCHICKENS 😭
Did y’all know that they hand make the round eggs and the square ones aren’t! The more you know 🌈
2 minutes in and this is just as chaotic as I thought it would be
Rank Jollibeee food itemss pleaseee
I am LIVING for this chaotic energy
I had surgery a few weeks ago and when I woke up all I did was ask for McDonalds hash browns. I did get like, 4 on the ride home and then I felt even more like death but it was 100% worth it
Eugene I feel you.  I am also a Texan who does not like Ranch.  I know the struggle.
This is what we needed!!!!!
And then there's me, who never saw most of these popular foods because they aren't available in my country😥
Yes! Another classic Keith and Eugene mess-around! 😏
Love the video, the constant switch of music bothers me a little though!! Maybe try stick to a few consistent tunes :)
McGriddle is the best, Eugene is WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
Feeling your heart consider a heart attack and death right there is a major part of the McDonald’s hotcakes eating experience
Euith Pronounced Youth name combo
I went to America few years back & thought everyone in America always talks about this McGriddle thing so I tried it & also got a sausage McMuffin incase didn't like it & I love pancakes, eggs, syrup, bacon but all together nope so I had to throw it out. It was not a good taste. Lucky had my second McMuffin.
Keith: Quarter Pounder with Cheese! Eugene: mmm humpher ma
Mcgriddles are my favorite!!
This is literally the best video you could have posted today. It’s my birthday (I’m 22) and I love McDonald’s and you guys so much!!! Thanks for keeping me sane all these years 😜
Eugene ranks power rangers series
Love that they're wearing yellow and red to fit the theme.  👌😂
My aunt loves the hotcakes but she brings her own syrup since they don't give enough...she uses like 3 packs of syrup per pancake so found bringing her own was better
16:17 what in the fuck Eugene LMAO, the way they feed of each other’s energy makes them so odd and I love it LOL
mcd’s breakfast 🔥
Eugene Lee Yang, famous internet Catholic
Who's wrong and who's right? One thing to recall is that manufacturing and recipes change over time. Well iam done here
Eugene: I am a big egg boy  I think we learnt that from Baking Cake Without a Recipe video 🤣🤣
You can tell who a person is by which sauce they use for their McNuggets. I’m all for sweet and sour supremacy
I don't know about how everybody else feels but chicken nuggets used to be so much better than they are right now. Like I will still eat them but they aren't a 10 out of 10 there may be like a 6 out of 10
💙
Sausage egg and cheese mcgriddles are  the best
He hasn't mentioned what language he's speaking unless it's complete jibberish
They’re dressed in the McDonald’s colors 🥲 so cute
I literally woke up this morning and thought “what happened to rank king?!” And here we are! A combination of my two favorite segments! 🥰
The crossover we all need it.
I haven't even finished this yet, but whoever came up to combine eat the menu with rank king deserves a raise.
Keith.             🍗🍗 There is a restaurant called *Eugene's Hot Chicken* You love chicken. You love Eugene. GO THERE 🍟
They’re not even drunk or high 😂
I ordered mcdonalds then i got the notification for this. So lemme tell you what I always get. Two McChicken biscuits add cheese and bacon then two hashbrowns and you replace one of the biscuits with a hash brown. Delicious
I still don’t understand this American “biscuit” nonsense and I’m glad the English breakfast muffin version was rated higher
Keith not knowing sex in the city references is so funny
i love the eugene/keith combo. it’s like the gayest person and the least straight, straight person coming together
You’re supposed to get the bacon egg and cheese McGriddle, not sausage. That was the first mistake
nothing makes me happier than seeing this when it was posted only 15 minutes ago
I just noticed, but the pillows behind them is the same colour as their shirts, now I can only focus on that 😂😂
Eugene can only talk about iconic tv shows and I’m here for it
well, now I just want to see them act out scenes from Titanic
"McToboo" - Eugene 2022 4:34
famous internet catholic Eugene lee yang 😂
The whole "tree" conversation integrated with SATC has me in splits
Rank King and Eat The Menu collab was something I didn’t know we needed but glad we got 😂
Kudos to the Food Babies on rubbing off on Keith and Eugene to match their outfits for the video!
As a vegan, I am only watching this video for Keith and Eugene. The duo we all knew we needed.
I'm glad to see Eugene again he seems happier
Maybe it's just me But the subtitles are too fast and not aligned with the audio
I like how it feels like Kieth and Eugene have never watched each other's food shows before XD
KeiGene?   Euke?  EuTh.  that's it. if they go to korea , they would be EuTh in Asia.  (audible groan)
So annoyed Australian Maccas stopped all day breaky last year 😩 only do hashbrowns all day now. Sometimes I just want a mcmuffin at 10pm at night damnit
"im right You're wrong  open wide " merch asap please
I love that Eugene’s shirt is matching te pillow behind Keith and vice versa
I'm never going to eat hotcakes the same again, thank you Eugene
The size of Eugene's bites compared to Keith's tho. 😂
Please maKe this a show! I would love to see this become a random show here and there like zach’s Candid Competition!
Eugene come to Ibiza and rank every nightclub
Ahhh shiiit, what is this, a cross over episode?!? Thats so awesome lol
I like this combo. More of this please!
Early
This is proof that The Try Guys really listen to their fans and what they ask for. Such a fun collab!
Let's just say, I'm right you're wrong, shut up!
Is Eugene absolutely Stoney baloney
I love that when Keith proposed eating all of everything, Eugene’s immediate reaction was “Becky would be so mad”
Sounds delicious
I have a video idea. Try guys try to make edibles without a recipe. I think it would be so funny! They have to try infusing the 🍃 without any help. They won't know how strong their edibles are or if they taste good.
IM TOO EARLY 🧥😌
the crossover i didn't know i needed!
All Hail the Return of the Rank King!
I love how they count down to say the name when it's so futile- Eugene is just garbling nonsense and grinning. Lol. It's like when they "TGGT" and he tries to turn as many words into "Gay" as he can while the other guys call in unison.
Eugene ruins everything.
The way they handled those pancakes before eating them gave me so much anxiety
Keith: item name  Eugene: *incoherent boo boo noises*
here before eugene leaves
Running out of ideas? Let’s recycle and add Eugene who everyone loves.  They know their audience.
"I'm a big egg boi"
Do the guys not post on Wednesdays any longer?
IM THIS EARLY!
I will ONLY eat my sandwich with scrambled egg. I can’t with the separated yolk. Bleck!!!
This was amazing.  Love u guys and what a crossover.
The bacon smokehouse was the best burger I've ever had at McDonald's 🤤🤤🤤
This is weird
Stop McGriddle slander.
Purple
Keith struggling with his best and worst taco had me dying.
A crossover of "keith eats the menu" and "Eugene is right, you are wrong shut up."  Dude that's actually brilliant!
The crossover of the century
Now all we need is a Candid Competition of science/baby stuff  for a Zach/Ned collab
Please eat the McDonald’s Sausage and Avocado pizza
The non collab - collab of the century
The first sentence was amazing lmao
Running out of ideas are we?!
I was waiting for a new rank king and this is perfect! Keugene!!!
I exclusively eat McDonald's because it is cheap. I do not like McDonald's for the taste.
Best of both worlds!!!!!
This is a bigger crossover event than what happened in Spider-Man: No Way Home
wait i just noticed 2 minutes in that they dressed in McDonalds colors OK STYLE ICONS
I honestly just discovered this channel a few weeks ago, and I'm obsessed! I love ypu guys!
The crossover we always wanted! :D
Took a page out of the Food Babies book! They’re dressed in McDonalds colours and/or ketchup and mustard
best duo
I never thought Keith and Eugene could be alone together in a video
I respect everyone who were involved in this Seriously the best piece that i ve ever seen on YouTube 💌 Hate off to well all 💟 love your videos  ❤  .
This is such a cute mashup, and I love episodes that feature the guys' genuine friendships.
Well, now I’m definitely gonna watch the mcdonalds eat the menu after this
Not even a minute in and I am so excited!!!!!!! What a great show mash up
EARLIEST I’VE EVER BEEN

I needed this collab
love u guys ❤
RANK THE MENU

Remember God loves you♥️ John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. PLEASE turn your life around and repent.🙏 the clock is ticking.....
hahaha
The crossover we didn’t know we needed.
At the before times in the before place 😂😂😂😂😂

The collab we wanted AND deserve
Hey guys love you all and hope you are well ❤️
