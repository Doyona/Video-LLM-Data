OH NO MORE RORY SHOW
wow he didn't say anything about Greg or liv golf iam amazed needs to shut it now and get on with golf
NOBODY CARES GO LIV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🌞
Not one camera angle down the line ffs
Rory still missing it in the wrong spots!! When is he and Harry, going to learn!!! It’s not rocket science! They need to fix this if he wants more majors!! 🤯
196 with wedge?
The bigger you become on your the more time you spend complaining about putts not going and bad lies and all that crap , if I was playing with someone standing there looking at a missed putt for 10 seconds I’d never play with them again … And then he can’t get onto the green out of the thick rough and the announcers give him excuses , he shouldn’t have missed the fairway , as one of the best drivers of the ball ever to play
Bad highlight. Bad camera works.
Huge fan of Rory, but I'd love to see Hatton take this one. I can only imagine Hatton's reaction.
Fantastic eagle!
What a man
Is there a more boring commentator than bjorn in any sport? 😴😴😴😴
I'd rather see Alex Noren
I want to see approach shots too with tracking lines. How the shots are shaped
How can you show highlights of the best driver of the ball in the world and not show a single tee shof
I love the Golf from Rory
His streaky putting is preventing him from winning more often
Who cares about Rory. He shoots 68 and is 11th. Can't find any other highlights.
Guys, you know there’s other world-class players in this competition who are playing really well & should be highlighted… PGA Tour YouTube levels of laziness
NOT PROTECTED TO WIN! NOT IN THE TOP 10!  Another pointless highlights package. No wonder PGA tour Highlights are way better. Show the leaders no matter what.  Leaders this week are English too 😂  Massive 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I know this sounds like a fanboy cliche, but he really seems like a genuine good, down to earth, humble guy. Love that about him.
And still only 7 shots off the lead! More pointless rory highlights - we don't care about. Where's the fitz/Hatton highlights??
Please less putts more pitches , en approaches
Bumhole paddy
One thing really disgusts me, all the haters on YouTube. None of you is worthy enough to lick Rory's shoes.
what is he doing playing golf in the Middle East? 100% hypocrite. he's been playing golf more with his mouth these days.
I'm confused. I thought Rory was dead against supposed Middle Eastern 'sportswashing' etc., yet here he is receiving vast sums of money from a country with a highly dubious human-rights record. Make your mind up, Rory!
Infatuated!!! let's not show the leaders rounds 1 & 2 just Mcllroy...
So Rory went head to head with the Torque GC's number 4 player and tied. Let's go Liv.
Get up earlier and shave … attention to detail
the guy that finished the day tied 11th makes the highlight video, get a grip DP World Tour (mind you a lot of the better players are on LIV now)
Go on rorey 👍🏌
World n.1 right there
Playing like a guy who hasn’t won a major in 8 years.
Rory should win every tournament 😂.  He’s playing against a weak field now that LIV is home to the best players in the world 😂.  I wonder if he’ll cry about LIV in his post-round interview?
APPROACH SHOTS! WTF the approach shot is WAY WAY WAY MORE INTERESTING THEN MISSED BIRDIE PUTTS . how thick is the editor ?
Show fewer putts. More drives and approach shots. Simple formula. Thanks.
McIlroy playing like me for a few holes 😅🤦🏼‍♂️. If only I could finish like that!
And then cried about LIV 😂
