I would like to point out my friend Adam isn’t actually my assistant, he’s a great friend of mine and its just a joke we have between us but I was quite rude to him in the video and apologise for this, sorry Adam 😔

When it doesnt hurt you its worth it but as a peasant its a scam
Video was ruined by how many times you complained about the price, just enjoy the moment and make the best of it
I hate the color combos but its the culture there I guess
This is crazy😂
Hotel looks average, around 4 starts in Portugal 😂😂
Still some how cheaper than NYC by 3x lmao
Your videos motivate me man. 🔥🔥
*Ungrateful. You complained about everything. This generation is doomed. you didn't even compliment the view or anything and your friends were rude to the hotel workers*
dude 1200 for THAT is banging, Im planning to save for the rest of the year and see it!
Great vid as usual buddy, but to be honest, I wouldn't stay there if they paid me...
*complains in scouse* 😅
The coolest part is this hotel was built in the 1990s and most if it has been untouched since construction
Top 2  Luxxe hotel Cagayan de Oro city  Philippines ;;:‘*
People are starving, and they have a golden escalator. Fucking pog ngl
Idk why people are complaining abiut the architecture its beautiful
What's with the anti-science masks?  Did Pfizer promote your video?  Or even some meds to treat your acne you get for non-science -based "be afraid of flu" rags on your face?
Bro don’t know what a daybed is Aahhh
That scenes😮 that montage❤ with music🔥 I am new here😍
After all, Dubai is too overrated. Can't have the Queen size bed.
1k for 7 star hotel = room in avg London 5 star
Lol
you could fit your 5 wives all in the tub at once, kinda ugly room though a bit over the top with the decor
In a few hundred years that building, and all others like it, will be rusted and will have become a whisper in the wind. All the money and energy spent to build it and stay in it will waste away as a dream. The hungry man dreameth and eats in his dream, but then he awaketh and he is still hungry. Woe unto this wicked and corrupt generation! Woe unto all who spend their money on those things which cannot satisfy! This generation has damned themselves with their pride.
22 pound cocktail is fairly standard in any super high end restaurant
nahh, too luxurious
Dubai is an huge depressing joke.
I would rather have like one less painting/less gold somewhere so they could have quality beds and bathroom hardware.. that tub/faucet flow rate was abysmal

Why me not rich and in 7 star hotel!
90 bucks is pretty normal price to pay for a meal for 2 people in switzerland 💀
I just want to thank you for showing me Shoptagr  now i can do my dream of traveling the world me and my friends that are going on it too just want to thank you
1300 for a night in a 7 star hotel .Is quite lit .Might do that next summer and stay for 2 or 3 days
Your comments about the décor is hilarious and spot on. I would really like to stay at this place, but I can't stand how the rooms look. I've watched other videos about it and the cheapness of appearance, tacky clash of colors and designs, etc...I'll pass on this one, I guess. Thanks for sharing your experience!
there r a lot of 7 star hotels
bro my names Adam dat crazy
This is what happens when you are only rich because of oil, you get one of the most pointless and ugly hotel designs. Cool on outside, ugly on inside. Needless gold, rooms that look like a Western Grandparents home.
❤thanks for sharing. Had no idea that there is such a thing as a seven star hotel. That’s amazing.❤
it was not worth it.
The Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai was opened in 1998 with a butler for every room – this has been the first hotel being widely described as a "seven-star" property, but the hotel says the label originates from an unnamed British journalist on a press trip and that they neither encourage its use nor do they use it in their advertising
Wrong, it's a 5 star, and management of Hotel even says so. The 7 star is a myth..by the way who awards the stars?
the room should come with a personal dog. then itll be worth it
220% havent subscribed out of 100% watching thats incredible
The pool is amazing but the room is so tacky and ugly...
Definitely overpriced. Plus I hate any place that (over)charges for everything, making me not want to put the place to full use.
I would like longer visual shots, and less cutting. Not that the vid is not smooth, liked the slipper thing at 9:04. And your reactions are fun, just like to see more of what you are reacting to.  Or should that be ‘more of that to which you react’? I have to try and remember: never use a preposition to end a sentence with.
Schumachers Island is in the west bit of ‘Greenland’ in the world islands of Dubai.5:50
0:21 They do tell the guy with the piano to move when they want to use the helipad, don’t  they?
The star system does not go up to 7…. 🤔
I don't think I would stay there even if I had the money. I'm happy enough with premier inn tbf.
Went there in 2008 and was shown around by one of the builders sons. Had VIP access. Was insane. $100 cup of tea and diamond encrusted hand guns in the jewelry store. Wow what an experience.
You're a total retard.  You were rude to your mate and all you did was complain about the amount of money spent ffs.  You're in a 7 star motel what do you expect?  You need to grow tf up.  The vid would've been great had you not moaned your arse off like a bi*ch.  Stay home if that's how you behave.
7 stars doesn't exist.   And it looks ugly and outdated as hell.
A fantastic place to visit! I stayed at the jumeirah beach club but had drinks in the sky bar and dinner in the basement. You’re quite right when you say you actually have to be there to appreciate just how opulent it is.
The design is horrible low level though. More like 3-4 star than anything, at least for us Scandinavians that have a good eye for interior design. Just the colors makes you scream inside...  Not impressed the slightest. Most good 5 stars are way better designed than this.
Hey, just found your channel, and this vid, sorry for being late! 😁By the way that "interesting looking sofa" is a chaise longue, and has nothing to do with sleighs! 🤣 🙂
ok
go all in you brokie
There is no such thing as a 6 or 7 star hotel recognised by any major hotel rating organization. Any hotel that claims otherwise has awarded themselves this rating.
It's all so tacky.
I would literally be scared to even breathe in a building like this
Predictably hideous
Yay a random F1 mention! Love it!
No such thing as a 7 star hotel. It’s all marketing buzzword bs lol
Looks dead tbf
Ben * casually forgets passport *
the video is great. but again whoever do the design, don't have any taste, East taste  or not. milion patterns, colours, nothing is symmetric. looks like going back to grandma, when her house is time capsule from 70'. i imagine service is at least worth it.
Cool
This is not a beautiful hotel room. I’ve never liked gold (Terrazzo, Marble, Shou Sugi Ban is far more eye catching) I grew up in Vegas and use to work on a cruise ship so this literally reminds me of both. 1 Hotel, Proper Hotel, so many more hotels are 100x better looking than this. You are paying for a room to say oh wow and sleep in it for the night. You ain’t getting that money back. This is why I just watch YouTube videos of people visiting places like this instead. It’s free.
The hotel can say they are 10 star, doesn't mean it's true....looks tacky AF!
I would hate for you to come to my house, you are so rude and immature with no respect for others things
Bruh I spent 900$ per night in Miami and it was 4 star hotel for me it's not worthed the money that i spent and this Dubai hotel is 100times better than the one i stayed no 🧢
I wish i could thumbs down this video multiple times
Just admit your "assistant" is your boyfriend lol
You should go skiing
That pizza looks like it came from a 7/11 though 12:21
Wtf is this video. "Let's stay at the only 7 star hotel".... then complain about how much everything costs and refuse to pay for expensive things.
Part of it is just incredible and the other part is offensive to my eyes
Little point in someone doing a review that can't even afford the taxi to the hotel. So much of this magnificent hotel and the aquarium in the restaurant was missed. Stick to easyjet hotels Mr Morris, it's much more suited to your budget and intellect.
He lost me at "old money."
The deco or is it the color scheme, l can’t really put my finger on it but l can smell the old room/item/ old people houses smell
Everytime he said, “my assistant…”🙄  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dubai uses slaves from india and other poor countries to build their buildings like qatar
Ben are not able to be critical about the places you stay at? The interior design is really tacky.
I had different thoughts about the mirror lol. Could be interesting
I do not enjoy leaving anything critical, especially because this video was superbly orchestrated however, calling your mate "assistant" at every opportunity (whilst you know full well he doesn't like it), made me uncomfortable. He said how lucky he was to be your friend, so he's not just taking the piss whilst you're paying for everything. Anyways, you'll earn well from that video and shouldn't your mate benefit too, minus all the disrespect?  I will not subscribe because I don't like people getting belittled or disrespected.
The hidden TV is huge for people like me who won't turn the TV on and would prefer the view.
what if you scratch off some of the gold to pay for it
I’ve literally paid “half” that price, at the Marriott (across the street from Disney Land) ….. for their Penthouse. If memory serves me correct, it was a three day stay, and included a FULL breakfast & Dinner. And it was for Eleven people and One ☝️ Dog. However, it wasn’t even a third as nice …… and had zero view. Although we did have a personal hot tub, and a fireplace. *So for what they got, and had access to ….. it looked like an Excellent deal.
shoptager is literally budget honey
I was like Ben was when I was 19. I am glad I grew up, I hope you do too and move to greater ventures
I just did this mission in Hitman 3
.. this is a 4.5 / 5 star hostel but okey :) arabia like eating sand
mirror celling bedroom cool did you two sleep .. ohh of course you did
nice vid but the hotel sucks
Great stuff
Proof that money can’t buy taste 😂
not worth it.
14:10 IMMATURE AND RACIST
Goofy capitalism tower
there are at least 7 7 star hotels you can find from a quick google search
As an interior designer I was cringing at the decor. Sure that was opulent in 1999 but they need to seriously revamp this place considering the cost to stay there. I was considering a stay there later this year but I might look at some smaller boutique hotels instead. I can't justify that price point.
Outrageously ostentatious and unappealing…no matter what demographic they have targeted.
It’s only worth it if you have the money to splash. If you’re just doing it for a YouTube video then I would say no
So everything was a la carte starting at parking for $1k
We get it, everything is expensive.😑
Prime example that money doesn't buy taste. Materials might be expensive, but that doesn't mean it automatically looks nice.
idk if I'm the only one who likes the interior design very much I think it's really classy and kinda cozy too. Great video btw 👍
I stayed there in 2018
A bit of optimism would have been appreciated for this kind of experience. Even for us watching.
you should've brought a black light to see how many things are covered in cum
Wish you luck mate, but you seem a lil too obnoxious. Maybe the younger non-45 year old market can help. Adios
So marginally more expensive than a weekend at Center Parcs then? 🙃
I’m just proud of my country
the interiors of that hotel room knew what they were doing of putting a mirror in top of the bed😅
Of course it doesn't worth it. It just represents everything Dubai is: Just a temporary expensive looking but cheap scam for stupid people with a lot of money. That lame failed double bed revealed everything.
Imagne breaking something in there 😭
"Honestly the definition of unnecessary" I'm deaddddd
The room was worth it for the experience, not something you’d want to do too often (unless you win the lottery)
Nothing could top this super luxury hotel ! This is absolutely incredibly amazing! The highest height of a super futuristic architecture, a vision of beyond dream of the most expensive hotel in the world!!!! The location is breathtakingly beautiful!!!
Ben saying there's an Urus but calling an Aventador SV and a Huracan two Lamborghinis around the Urus
Ich hab auch ein Hotel mit 8 Sternen
This video should have had a gold counter.
THIS IS SO EXPENSIVE 😭 HOWEVER I CAN UNDERSTAND THEY SERVED REALLY GOOD SERVICE PLUS THEIR INTERIOR IS SO LIT!! SALUTE TO THE DESIGNERS!!!
There's at least one more 7 stars hotel, located in western Georgia, not too far from Batumi.
I rode a jet ski around that hotel when it was under construction
I lost it when they exposed the bed. A hotel is a hotel whether it's 7 stars or not it seems 🤣🤣
i wonder if this was when they were filming the second advert where emirates flew an a380 round the burj with a flight attendant stood on the top
I stayed at Jumeirah al Naseem next to it.
keren
The kind of people that stay at these places do not have to even think about the cost of things, it was very off putting listening to you constantly complain about the cost and things being unnecessary throughout the entire video, of course the things are unnecessary, It’s a 7 star luxury hotel. It’s supposed to be frivolous and unnecessary.
who pays for this ?
From what you have shown us, it seems that there is barely anyone staying there. It looks empty. Gee, I wonder why (most likely because if it's age and room/food prices). Imo, it's way over priced for what you actually get. The fact that they kicked you out of the pool because it closes, is not what I would expect for a self appointed '7 star' hotel. I would expect that they should have someone there 24/7 so you can stay or leave as you see fit, and to also have someone there that would help keep the birds away from the pool area (because they will crap in the water if they are allowed to stay). This is definitely a hotel I would never stay at even if I could afford it.
what a fatal mistake, allowing these junky boys to represent, or misrepresent should I say, such a top hotel, what do these junky boys who never saw but the junkiness of British slums know?, they destroyed the reputation of this hotel with this video,  when would the Golf countries get rid of inferiority complex towards the western citizens, no matter how junky they are.
Yeah anyone that turns their nose up at great new food probably shouldn't be staying in a hotel suite like that. and the interior designers / the Arab that choose tha interior design needs shooting.
Well now she’s dead in 2022
Queen Elizabeth should live in this mansion
tok buttir eh mu kecek nate apo.. gilo mung!

Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Is that guy ur friend or ur assistant cuz ur treating himself lil shitty while smiling… just cuz ur smiling doesn’t make it ok. It’s actually worse in most cases….
❤️This is the best place ❤️
9:04 bro that transition 🔥🔥🔥
Great video Ben!
And all built by slaves ! Amazing
For ur kind information there’s no 7 star hotel in the world... every hotels service is scaled from 1-5 ... it was one journalist who was impressed by the service of that hotel n after that he said that it’s more than 5 star...
you wanna tell after spending all that money on the room u still have to pay at the restaurants?! nah you bullcrappin' me.
the definition of unnesscary - i liked just for that
That was an innocent comment, mirror for playing chess in bed 😅 not what that mirror is for
Definitely worth it!
13:29 boys in 7 star hotel. (Typical)
what about emerates palace?
Thanks for this video. You have done fantastic. I think once in a life, spending this much money is worth spending. However, you have not taken many glimpses in detail. Video was cool but very fast. Anyway, it was still the best.
Honest-fucking-ly i don't get the whines about these interior colors, im from the other side of that country too & apparently 'royal nuance' is differ in lots of part of the world, some prefer the same boring colored hotels just bcuz the colours of this 7 stars hotel doesn't fit their "fancy colours".
WDYM ONLY 7 U DON'T SEEM TO HAPPY AND IT BRU
How can u complain so much at a seven star hotel? Watch this guy! He will show u exactly how to complain about luxury! Sad...this is the first video like this that I cudnt finish watching because of all the complaining..
if u have this much money to make a video like this in a  hotel like that with that kind of gear i dont think you need any subscribers
why you complain about the prices all the time….. you go there ..i don’t think the hotel invite you…
Stop Bitchin about the money for crying out loud
What was the cost for the night mate? I must have missed it
respect bro
I am only liking this video because of the countless times Ben talks about how much he spent
Kkekslekelelelelelelslslslslsls
Nice video I want to go there
lolll ..inviting your "assistant" to a 7 star hotel stay and then making him feel like a moron the whole time. excellent.
This video is a waste of time, i thought i will know about the hotel not about you and your friends
The seven star hotel is a title there is no 7 star hotels in world and burj al Arab is five star hotel
Doesn't look like a 7* Blue Eyes White Dragon.
Lol these songs are making me wanna watch Hikaru’s stream
Michael Schumacker WHAT
I subscribed just to get you off the "666" subscribers. You're welcome.
Whats the point of having so much gold everywhere
The amount of sellout to give u money in this video is INSANELY CRINGE !
I would love to stay there! 😲😲😲
How about a video of the burj al arab workers? I just want to see how they are treated! Please
Who else is arab here ?
ugliest room really
I was actually expecting it to be more!
rating agency can rate only 5 stars, so the claim that this is the only 7 star hotel is stupid, and illogical
Just subscribed
My crazy thought, am kinda broke so i was wondering if I subscribe will you guys offer me $500 , big help big fun.. ✌🏻😁🌼
so how much did it all cost?? all I know is that a cocktail cost £22 and a pizza £169
Honestly nothing was as expensive as i thought
U got urself a new sub
I like your contents.
I went to dabi for one day and I saw it
Rich people have so much extra money that they just throw away. They waste their money.
This hotel is such a waste. They've wasted so much gold. There is so much wastage on this planet. Nice video though. Don't be so mean to your assistant.
With a scouser on tow...watch your hub cabs ..how this bunch of scallies got into a seven start hotel is a mystery.All of them on the rob i guess
Looks dated inside.
If I were the hotel managers, I would kick these two idiots out of the hotel right away.
u could have gotten the chocolate train come to ur room
How much is the room rate per night ? What is the area of the room in square meters ? Do you stay there at your own expense or got it for free ? Nice video 👍👍👍

"it's the definition of unnecessary" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 i laughed waaaaay  too much about that line
The interior is too overloaded sorry guys but the views are crazy. I for one wouldn't stay here and spend such a lot of money for ALL THAT GLITTER.... Appreciate you making the vlog to show us what the cheapest room looks like at BURJ AL ARAB
It was the giant mirror above the bed for me 😂   It’s actually not that expensive, about $1,500 less by now. There’s a place in CT USA that’s about the same if not more 😒
Nice video until those 2 stupid came to jump in bed.
Taj Mahal Palace, is a hotel in India, Colaba, Mumbai. (I think it's the most luxirious hotel I've ever been to)
Quit complaining about the price you poor
Thank you for spending the bucks to tour us here!! 🥳❤️🎉
Hi Ben, I am your fan..  from India tamil nadu..
Why do you remind me of a certain diver... you even sound like him!!!!
It's all gold plate, you let that broad gas you up 😂 😂 😂
definitely not worth
Try Empire Brunei. Gold THROUGHOUT WITH A MASSIVE CHANDELIER AT THE ENTRANCE AND a gold club. It was amazing.. it is also a 7 star
It's worth it
Why would you get a hotel like this and bring a dude??? I would have to smash it in every rooom
You didn’t let your friend crash on the couch in your crazy room? At all?
I saw a 7 star Hotel in tunisia
people say that dreams always come true so I am going to decree that the next time I dream of going to Dubai in my Dubai Dream Book I am going to book the best room in the  Burj Khalifa Hotel The World Famous 7 Star Hotel  !

I think it was worth it because i went to a five star hotel in Dubai and it was the same price
Yeah careful asking for a gentleman's kit see because Sharia law prohibits homosexuality and you can even go to prison for such a thing and you wouldn't want them to get any ideas beings theirs 4 guys in the room
You look like the male charli damelio
The amount you've paid is totally worth it considering this is the same amount you would spend at a Ritz Carlton in the U.S., which is a considerably lesser experience.
You realize this hotel can get in trouble with Dubai law for giving you condoms, right? It's unlawful in the country to have sex outside of marriage and even though hotels with tourists do it a lot, they can even get shut down for this.
I-I if I go to that hotel I will be very very happy and excited I really want to go to that legendary hotel
😍 cool😊😊👍👍
Aw man we all wanted to cancel you☺

It is a great experience one should do it and feel like a king for once. I stayed here about 8 years back and the time spent here was so amazing.
quid? 🇺🇸
I think the deco is super tacky. Overwhelming to say the least... I've been in 5 stars hotels and palaces and this does not compare. I would be disappointed if I ever had a room like that. Maybe the service is great but as for the visual experience... I recommend Paris, London or New York. The Arabs don't seem to realize that gold trimmings are a No-No for good architects and interior designers...
Ok we understand this fucking hotel is insanely expensive but your plan was to make a video about it and obviously you haven't being saving enough money to go there and you were freaking out about the cost of everything. My point is: you weren't prepared to go there. To me it's like you wanted to do an Everest climbing video and you only had a pair of old shoes and a short.
small 50m skyscraper
Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi is also a 7-star hotel.
Explanation is not perfect, you have to improve
GO to spend a furtune of the flight and than a astronomic some on A WEIRD HOTEL for to buy a cheap watch and glasses  and make a bargain for those two DUBI IS A WHOLE CREP with CREPPY PEOPLE
Your a jerk to your “assistant”
Amazing video. Really felt like I was there. 🔥🔥
Amazing video. Really felt like I was there. 🔥🔥
I thought most of the things were ugly. And how did they earn 7 star? Did a middle east company just lie and make stuff up? Seems right
I think this must have been an expensive trip... Every 5 seconds...
so I would never ever spend this much on a hotel, but tbh considering how nice it is, I was actually surprised that it wasn't a lot more expensive
His assistant look like his boss
I went to Dubai I hated it everything was so strange. I speak Arabic and I’m Arab but it was not that great there.
"Sofa seat" is for luggage...
I'll be honest, £1,100 is a lot less than I would have thought
The fake king size bed was aturn off but the rest was pretty neat
u need to learn the art of taking scenery with your camera. it move to fast
Welcome to another episode of watching things you can not afford
Yea, all the majic between you and your assistant. Now I see why he's got an attitude. It's his turn to be the girl. Lmmfao 😂
Bro, the 🌟 rating only goes to a maximum of " 5 🌟's". Just because Dubai wants to out do the rest of the world in luxury doesn't give Dubai authority to raise the ratings for hotels , restaurants or anything else fir that matter. There are nicer rooms in 4 star hotels in The United States .
You never said how much it was!
No one is going to talk about the slave labor that built hotels like this and others in Dubai? I wouldn't go to one of these places if it was free.
mans said beach bag
what does this 2010 imac in there?  LOL
bruh how much did it cost
That is the ugliest, tackiest hotel room I've ever seen. lol
Sorry, that hotel looks like some cheap ass place in Vegas where you can catch a VD from the sheets. I get it, I really do ... but man ... what a waste for a 1978 Poconos experience LMAO  j/k not hating on you at all, just the Hotel seems a bit too much for ... well ... basically anything lol
The hotel room reminded of a Hollywood set in some technicolor  movie made in the 1950's.
Thanks for sharing 🌻  Impressive 🌈
Your friend definitely slept over 👀 you not fooling anyone 😂‼️
Overkill on the shiny gold.  Almost kinda tacky. Especially the elevator room.
meh. worth
A "7 star" hotel that gives you a time limit on your swimming? lol ok
Me driving around dubai in my honda civic, i will get more attention than those people driving fancy cars.... jojojo
Não têm bom gosto, pois não?! Muito obrigada pelo vídeo!
Do buy
Milano also have a 7 Star Hotel
Actually, they gave themselves the 7 stars, the most u can get honored are 5 ;)
Who made them a 7 star hotel? Im thinking they gave themselves that distinction, doesnt look more impressive than your typical 5 star hotel...
This was NOT a good advert for the hotel.
Live large next time. To much money talk is gaudy!!
In Vegas they now make you walk down to the front desk to get the condoms.  They won’t deliver them to your door.  Put me in a very awkward position and it ruined the moment.
Nope, Aman resorts are 7 star, and there are more
imagine the front of desk after that phone call... he wants condoms.. for that room with another man.... where 2 more men just went up to ..... WATERBLOON FIGHT!!!!!!!
The Arabs build all of this but all of them just stay in the deserts (locals)
There's no such thing as a 7* hotel. It's just marketing BS made up by the hotel
"Pointless, but sick"
To think the creator of Minecraft could buy 3 of these is bonkers
7-star hotel but using a fake king bed??? Yeah... that's not a 7-star hotel, that's a ripoff. If they cut a corner there just imagine the corners they cut which we don't see. Perhaps I'm just a pessimist but I also worked in the hospitality industry (hotels in major cities throughout the US) so I've kind of got an eye for how quality the accommodations are. Also my first impression of the furniture (desk, couches, chairs, etc.) was not a good one - just looking at them you can tell they're not of extremely high quality like you would expect at the "best hotel in the world".  It's not surprising seeing this in Dubai though. Essentially every luxury hotel/condos/townhomes/etc in Dubai has this problem in one way or another. The only way I can explain it is like this, despite the massive hoards of wealth over there the culture is actually still very "nouveau riche" so to speak, a lot money but little taste/sense. They misinterpret something costing a lot of money as being luxury when that is not the case. If you go buy a $5 bag at a flea market and then put a $5000 price tag on it, I hate to break it you, but it doesn't make it a luxury handbag nor does it make it worth the money.  You'd get much higher quality for your buck at a $1300/night hotel in Las Vegas.
Living your best life , good to 👀
Yeah while poverty and other worldly issues are going on let’s just build a hotel out of gold
Doesn't Dubai have poop trucks because they have no sewage system?
There's an Indonesian maid somewhere there, let's ask what she think about all of that.
The rooms and decor is ugly ….. don’t care how expensive this hotel is…..all of my senses are in shock 🥺🥺
Built by slaves
7 stars hotel and has an iMac from 2011.
Why they get 7 stsrs hotel in Dubai? Becouse you dont have anything alse in Dubai. In Swiss they can build it also but there is no need for it cuz you can enjoy in 3 stars hotel even more that برج البدو.
**Indeed, When it comes to beauty it it Dubai NOT Mumbai!**
Well I can definitely say for sure I’m so mad YouTube started showing how many people are subbed because I’m getting sick of every video telling me to sub. I don’t even have the bell turned on for the subs I like because I only want my phone dinging for important things
1.1k euro a night, well its not that much
Is MORRIS GARAGES yours?😂
I really expected it to be at least 5000$ / night
You booked a hotel room at the most famous and expensive hotel in the world, and somehow you're shocked at the prices? This video was good from an informational standpoint, but the editing, camera stability, shot composition choices (including your friend using the toilet, backlit at the window, and just sitting around disinterested in the background), along with showing all of your friends jumping hard onto the bed multiple times— which I find extremely low class and tasteless, explains why 222% of your viewers don't subscribe. You seem out of your depth.
There is one in Milan too
the funny thing is that so expensive hotels and they dont even have sewers. literally there are poop truck
DAMN it looks.... ugly
This entire city is pointless.
Feel like the fact you spemt so much isnt quite worth the stay , but it was a great video and very interesting
Weirdly I think that the rooms are super ugly compared to some of the cheaper options in Dubai
but there are lots of 7 stars hotel for example in milan there is the first 7 star hotel ever created and certificated
all that for less than 2k 😨
I’ve been to a 6 star hotel and that was amazing but this is just over the top, am I the only one who finds gold tacky?
i mean, you're in dubai in the most expensive hotel.. not sure why you guys are sooo surprised by the prices and tend to fixate on that, honestly that kindaaa messed up the otherwise great content for me. Hope you guys still enjoyed the experience tho!
If only you know the future says, you, I'm know that indeed crypto currency is the future, investing in it now will be the wisest thing to do.
I don't wanna be the guy who can afford staying in this hotel, I want to be the guy who pays him  his salary
Woah
220% havnt subscribed so everyone has to sub 2.2 times still guys!
Same price as a not 7star hotel room in London. Just to put in perspective how stupid prices are in London haha !
It is amazing what slavery and exploitation can creat. Please research about Dubai and humanright of the workers. Thanks and have a nice day✌🏻
Honestly I kinda worth it with the amusement park food pool and stuff
Insanely rich. Strugled to get food here😭🤲💫😘👌👍💪🤲🤲🤲
ngl that's one ugly room haha
A big Thank You to the Internet... now I can watch myself feel Poorer than the poor I am 😢 Never even been to a 3 star hotel
I am not sure why there is the annoying music in between. It is just distracting from the footage and experience.
"Play your chess in bed" Sure, that's what they are for.
It is nice to live off your parents dream.....  With their money!       Opps
Nice to live off what your parents had!
that's not what the mirror on the ceiling is for
i live in the dubai.
Id rather take a trip to rome and stay in a 3 star hotel then that and in dubai
How did it get past 6 stars? Lol
The interior looks really dated
Ngl I love the interior and colour scheme
terrible camera work..
Imagine pretending sponsors didn't pay for this entire video.
Tbh the room needs a design update. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Ugly hotel all the way. So tacky. People don't know what to do with their money.
Your filming skills are abysmal; what a waste of money
the interior is hideous 🙈
You had me absolutely hooked when you showed that your Uber in Dubai was a Tesla Model X.  Yes, I was able to identify it instantly as a Model X because who wouldn't be able to recognize those gullwing doors?  Older units without the steering yoke and a traditional steering wheel are actually still my dream car, but if I had to go with a brand new Tesla at this point instead of buying used, I would have to go with either a Model 3 or Model Y.  I am beginning to hate the Model 2 after hearing that it will not even have a steering wheel at all as part of Tesla's wholesale push to get their full self-driving system fully online.  Also, which of the items in the hotel are the true freebies and which ones stay in the room?  When you are sinking tens of thousands per night into staying in that kind of a room, there had better be a whole lot more that you could get away with taking from the room when you leave than the standard - albeit grossly overpriced - fare.
I just found your channel but this video was fun to watch so il subscribe to your channel :)
going to the only 7 star hotel in the world and bitchin about how expensive it is...good job moron
I'm sorry, but I can't stand this guy's accent.  Who, over the age of three, says, "Bahfroom" instead of BATHROOM?
Looks cheap & tacky. Sorry, just not my style.
It’s double the price at Christmas
I need a holiday…
Come Ben, go and be the only vlogger who reveals how much the sponsor paid him for this video?
Hope I could stay in that hotel. Char!
It’s Dubai obviously everything is expensive
Those seagulls are living the best life
Wow! Wish i can stay there even 1 night
I stayed there for 10 days it’s pretty chill 😬🙏🏻
7 stars? Wow! I want to visit the only 100 star hotel!
They be really thinkin we all have oil pumps
so much gold, really unnecessary imo you won't be bringing any of it with you anyway so yea lol
I think that for one night it isn't great value but if you stayed for quite a while it probably would be.
I actually stayed in 2019 very 👍🏻
Jesus loves you all he died on the cross for you i pray and I beleive that you will find him weather that'd be today or another day. Jesus loves you all AMEN! <3
This dude sounds hella condescending
is that KLCC from malaysia?!  -  12:05
I mean like.. it's a beautiful hotel and all, but like the interior design could do with a bit of touch up for a 7 str hotel. Anyway great video :)
Adam and you have a really fun friendship! I would love to go on trips with my friends like you guys!
The First certified seven stars hotel is in Milan.
Umaid bhawan, rajasthan , india is also a 7 star hotel (authorised)
The antithesis of decor I like, if it wasn’t so expensive I’d say tacky
This place is just ugly
Whenever I watch or hear anything about Dubai now, all I think about is Adam Something's video...
Ur "assistant" are spoil on everything
Reminds me of the place padme was staying where she almost got assassinated in attack of the clones
If I'll stay there for 1 day, I'll not sleep cuz it's too expensive 😭
crazyy wow
its not worth  at all
I can't believe they just push the beds together, that is crazy.
All that gold and the toilet doesn't even have any bidet
this compagnie is rippin off ur money like what do u need with the gold everywheren like if im gonna spend that much money id rather have better quality everything, mayby a sauna as well
*Imagine paying to stay at a crazy hotel like this & then complain about prices of everything*
bafroom ,😭 anyways love this video
🔥
"It is definitely the definition of unnecessary" lol
That room looks sooo cheap
Sorry but asking viewers to answer “is it worth it?” is such a cop out. How should we know you’re the one who stayed there. You should tell us your opinion. For someone who spent a lot of money making the video I didn’t feel like you did much of a review of the hotel at all.
Cost ????
I don’t think it’s “dated”….looked luxurious and I would not unreasonable
I was in dubai few days ago
There are much more expensive hotels here in greece than Burj al Arab
Thumbnail $3259
The cheapest room in the whole place looks like a presidential suite anywhere else 🤯
Do they wipe clean your .ss over there!!!😂
Livingbobby posted a video where he stayed in this room just under $200
right so how much was it
Been there
It feels too expensive to even watch this video
there is a 7 stars hotel in Milan, there is not only the burj al arab
Lots of beggar people are targeting your place and robbers tooo!
Because ur too rich
3249 dollars give some sallary
有中国人吗？举个爪？
Nothing special.. except just fake gold everywhere...
Did anyone consider the fact that you had 2 men sharing a room, who then invited 2 male guests to the room, before asking for condoms in a gentlemens kit......in dubai? Bold move there chief haha
*sips tea* "It's hot" ~ Ben Morris, 2021
As a travel influencer, you should know there are no 7-star hotels. Not even 6-star.
Stop complaining about the interiors!! The patterns are unique and represent typical dubai culture. Appreciate it.
My assistant, this cost me a lot of money, my assistant...
It's like a clown designed those rooms, gross man...smh 🤦‍♂️
So how much did it cost? I missed that
8:13 Steal the light
Go with a school bus lmao
Dubai feels so soulless
AND ONE NIGHT
Well, the video is great but hering your complains for everything is quite annoiyng, if you cannot afford this kind of places just do not go. It's quite simple, nobody will never force you to go and do something you won't.
The decoration... So beautiful!!!
The laughable gore-tex putatively squeak because notify bioinformatically heal below a roasted spear. long-term, ill margin
weird i cant find any negative comments
Legends are watching this after 6 months ...
I am shocked that a King size bed is made out of 2 beds. This is a scam!! And they charge extra for chicken on pizza. Wtf !!
New Sub here Loved the video ❗️
They actually give away an iphone 12 8:10 to you if you book that hotel room??
The water is so bumpy... as he's on some of the calmest seas i've ever seen
7 star my ass ,it doesn't even have a working sewerage system it's all just a luxurious illusion
omgggg
9:10 , lit transition ben! lit!
It's 5 ⭐
well, seen cooler rooms, if the hotel is 7 stars then should exist 8 star hotels xD idk why it smells like politics in that place
Ive actually been there
"old money" haha none of that looks like old money
la hawla wala quwwata illa billah
You shouldn’t be so rude towards your friend. In this video I saw you being mean to him, telling him he didn’t pay for the toilet, throwing with his iPhone and more, especially in front of 1.2 million watchers. I disliked this video because of that.
If it was all really gold, then why is it tarnishing? Because it's brass.
start watching from 6:18, before that it is just wasting time and using word "money" repeatedly
Be nice to your assistant.
Does it have proper sewage system?🤣🤣 -adam something
I was expecting at least another zero…
I think it’s hilarious how this dude is just laughing in shock about the markup on everything in a hotel like this. Also, why is he pretending his “friend” is his personal assistant? Just a weird video to watch.
Nice for some to go to Dubai I would get thrown of a building lolz
Come to Pakistan u will get free stuffs and more subscribers
The way Dubai is wasting their money is frightening. Their vision is so shortsighted.
اهلاً بِك 🖤📍
9:05 transition ❤️ woah
there are some 7 Stars in the wolrd not only this
this is gon br my senior trip
Design wise, it's quite ugly!
So $1,122? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA  Dude go to Cavo Tagoo in Mikonos, Greece for a night and see for yourself what expensive actually means. hahahaha
"I dont want cheese" said no one ever
What a tool this kid is. Takes forever to say nothing.
Apparently it's cost him alot of money.
I would think they would have upgraded that iMac in the last decade, that's a 2011 model in their room
If I went there, the only Ugly thing in that Hotel would be me.
Haha it's a 7 star hotel why are you complaining 😅
You must pay for rolce roys
they should just get rid of that apple PC and use a real gaming pc with better performance lol
Kaya siot
It's so ugly
This hotel is so extravagant I wouldn't be able to stop feeling uncomfortable/scared to touch the amenities. It would feel almost sinful to stay in such an expensive and luxurious suite.
Damn I'm actually impressed by the sponsor
Or maybe you could've had a better assistant that actually be grateful to record with you.
the design was underwhelming for a 7 stars hotel
Don't want to spend anymore money. Rides a Tesla Model X. 🧐
that’s the ugliest hotel room i’ve ever seen in my life
"what an unnecessarily expensive hotel, who would even stay ther--- then I saw so many people in the breakfast
17:01 yw
That 7 milion dolar Mansion is nothing. Look in Cluj-Napoca. A city in a 3rd WORLD country with 5 rooms and a bit of green is Wörth 2 milion to build, not Buy
The 7th star allows u to shoot someone if u think they don't do a good enough job
Bro why is your dumb friend so depressed the whole video while stay for free at the best hotel in the world?? Get someone else bro
i thought u are Faze Rug
For 1,225 quid. For a view like that, in a hotel like that. Fair priced. Very fair priced.
STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR MONEYYYYY
If you wanna do these things on a video, no need to cry about your money.
MR beast be like i will buy all room in this hotel
Honestly the interior of this building is one of the ugliest I've seen ever... -_-
This design is basically ture middle east essence with the sea as a addition to it, the Gold implifies it's superiority over others and the beds sizes differe on sizes.. And the interior is from the best materials you can find on this Planet.. Live in their and then say whther it 6 or 7 stars.. Peace !
The cheapest room looks crazier than all the hotels I’ve ever been in combined.
Its not the only 7 star hotel. Hotel seven star Galleria in Milan since 2007
the bathroom sick tho ngl
Bruh this is not the only 7 star hotel
Everyone should just spam 1 star reviews and make then not 7 star anymore
Looks like casinos I’ve stayed in only I didn’t have to travel to the UAE to enjoy.
So how expensive is it i cant find it
i feel like its a tacky kind of luxury
What is up with the donkey ass editing. I would like to see what something looks like for more than 2 seconds. Trash 🗑 2/10
❤️
It looks like a ps5
Very beautiful 👌👌👌
Signiel Hotel in Korea I think is also 7 stars
tv goes down so you can see the awesome view better, IN THE BED, dude, look at that s***, amazing, not useless at all
This hotel is more facade than quality. It seems the cost makes it 7 star 😂
Dubai looks cool in the fog 🌫
Never beg for subscribers.
If the sea level rises 10M Dubai is gone ... and so is Holland.
7star hotel with no sewers system and at a morning lot of trucks carrying 💩 😏
Dubai is a fucking joke. Great video, tho.
People lose thousands of dollars each day trading stock & forex matket. So whatever you spent was actually worth it compared to losing it for nothing.
That's not fog, it's the shitty Sandstorm.
God, you are an easily impressed child.
7 stars is a very clever marketing trick that they used to promote the hotel worldwide. 5 stars is the highest official rating, so this hotel just made up their own thing that is not actually real
There is no such thing as a 7 star hotel . The rating goes to 5 and that’s it. It all started with a journalist saying if there were such a thing as a 7 star hotel this would be it .
Really off topic but i always wonder how men like him get their lashes to look like that LOL
7 star hotel in the middle of a desert and a city that is just capitalism on steroids where you can’t even legally hold hands with your partner for fear of arrest.  About as far from worth it as it’s possible to get.
It’s carbon dated. 1999 was a long time ago.
how much its cost to check in?
lmao. " smell like money" 😭😂
Goes to a 7 star hotel, dressed like a hobo....
Painting is probably because there is no window.
Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's home's costs  2 billion dollars 1 billion more than this.
Does the cost include the meals and the drinks? because if it does, I say it's worth it for a very nice experience!
A TV that can be lowered so you can enjoy the full view.  This guy: pointless
Should make a video abou how workers from outside are treated in dubai and all these other beautiful arab countries.
Its not the only 7 star hotel there is is the worls!
Why not just visit India and rest at somewhat same lavish Hotel and drain just 700$
Scam or not, it’s about the experience. These guys can’t even afford the full experience, so thumbs down to start. Either you go there ready to spend on your experience or go elsewhere, it’s very simple. Otherwise, you too will be miserable eating over priced pizza at the world’s only 7-star hotel.
It is not foggy but hazy.
If you're traveling, where do you leave your passports behind so that you can't check in?
Dude, this place is bigger than my apartment😂
Am I the only one who thinks it's actually cheap?! No I don't mean I'm rich, just that India has places that will rake up way more for a night 🤔
You know, your video has made me feel that I'm not missing anything.. Must have been a superb experience but the room's decor was too colourful for my liking - and like you said, dated and expensive. 😊 Thank you for showing us this.. And for being so down to earth and giving an honest review.
Just subscribed😊😃😉💜
I don't really think it's worth the money everything looks so worn out inside
yeah... yeah you're right, this hotel is definitely the definition of unnecessary and.... fucking extra. but im just a bitter normie
I love your accents.  The color scheme was unpleasant, just as you said.  Next time, please include the American dollar equivalent when listing the cost of things.  Your video was awesome!
How can someone goes for vacation during this pandemic? I want to go for vacation too😭
This Is  So Fucking U G L Y   Its unbelieveable that rich people have literally no taste in interior design 90% of times
You’re really a douche of a ‘friend’. I HOPE you apologized to him personally.
Did he call the decor outdated? Bro, you didnt know what half the stuff was in the room. Its called elegant.
not subscribing for your attitude
Also in Milan theres a 7 stars hotel.
The room cost was very reasonable..!
Yeah I think Adam slept over..!
Just wow
This is too gaudy and terrible interior design. Probably trump's taste.
I'm going to celebrate one of my birthday''s at The Burj Al Arab!!!
to say that hes spent over a grand for one night, that hotel is deffo not worth it look at the interior i laughed when i saw it and the bed spilt in half wtf how are they getting away with that to say its a "7 star hotel" , what a waste of money
I am proud till now that i used to be one of their Executive Butler... Best memory ever
Stupid video, spend my time on bulshit
Omg 🤦‍♂️
This hotel is a 5🌟 (the highest official hotel ranking). There is no such thing as a 6* or much less a 7* hotel in the world. It has been erroneously described as "the world's only 'seven-star' hotel", the hotel management claims never to have done that themselves.
I have to say, I was disappointed by the room's decor. It seemed basic and it came across as extravagant for the sake of it in terms of the gold added into the surroundings for the rest of the hotel. Perhaps being there in person and finding money no object would make me think differently. Who knows? Anyways, thanks for showing us the hotel and room. I'm assuming there were varying prices regarding the rooms so if you'd have gone for the most expensive suite - I wonder if that would've actually had a proper queen-sized bed that weren't two beds pushed together?? 😂
He is treating his mate terrible, keeps telling him to get out.
The decoration is so 90s. Even if I could afford it,  it wouldn't be in my bucket list.
Reality hits hard when you realize your bank account.
I went to that water park lol
It was tacky. All that choppy gold and blue. But good video. Liked it.
Spent part of my Honeymoon here,4 nights: Stayed in The Panaramic Suite. You truly have to be there in person to appreciate it. I could go through the price of everything (my wife's gold flake cocktail 🍸 for example 110 euro, our last meal 540 euro in The Al Mahara restaurant), but it was 10 k all in and worth every penny. Those cherished memories I will always have with for the rest of my life; and that to me is priceless.
9:30 here we have the masterba~ ..throom
The thing is its 24k a night…
Are you both couples?
You’re very disrespectful
how are they so calm ,i would be so hyped if i we're in a 7 stars hotel 😂
Spend like Arab 🔥
The price is reasonable. When I was in Kensington- pre-covid- basic room was £600.
what i live in dubai but never had dat kinda money
It’s worth it for sure . It’s not alway about modern furniture
2 hundred twenty percent...?
My friend entered and won the first Godolphin Lucky Seven racing stable competition in 1999.  She won a Rolls Royce, which she sold for £50,000 and a two week holiday in (the then brand new) Burj Al Arab.  Back then there was a member of staff assigned specifically to each guest who followed you around with discretely and was ready to get you whatever you required at any time.  She said it was a bit strange to have the guy suddenly appear with ice cold water and towels when you were beside the pool 😂
Yup. You can tell this guy's personality is garbage and has no class nor taste. He can't even appreciate the good side of the hotel because his broke ass is focusing on the fact that he can't afford the place :')
This is bs.. i once saw a 9 star hotel in an italian back alley
Had to turn off cos of the way you speak to your 'mate'
my guy spent more on a pizza than I spent on 10 takeaway in the past 2 months, and I've been feeling so guilty after wasting money on takeaways every few nights
Take some tools and get the gold. Making holiday cheap lol
Dumbest 7 star hotel in the world.. Rooms look gaudy as hell... the room designers  should be FIRED!
Just the royal roice was worth it
MrBeast needs to come here
Lol they wanted you to keep those flip floos and the slippers to advertise
The observant daisy optimally like because vermicelli simplistically ban pro a materialistic landmine. noxious, ignorant cement
chavs
❤️🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Liar there are 27, 7 star hotels
This place doesn't have the look of "old money", this is the look of NEW money!
Dude you have to keep the amenities pack
Love it! Thank you  for wonderful video! It is really interesting & motivating for travel. Cannot wait when all of us start travel again!  ww
I love to watch rich people still doing luxury things during this pandemic, keep our dreams alive bro. Love it
What an amazing video!! Would love to see you review other hotels around the world as well!! ❤️
Gaudy and tacky.
It is not the world only 7 ⭐️ Hotel. Italy (Milan) has someone too
Anyone know the song at 4:40 ??
You're kinda cute
Deffo ahead of its time, so much gooold
Does your assistant have a name, plzzz use that😗
It's 5 star hotel. There are no 7 stars hotels in the world.
why does it looks like titanic
idk why i‘m watching this, i‘ll never will be there😂😂😂😂
I’m sorry was that good toilet paper??
How can it be the world's only 7-star hotel?
Bloody boring these video, bla bla I spent this I spent that I don’t want to spent.. subscribe 😂😂😂 amateur
wow i finally got too see inside i can see it from everywhere in Dubai
Every country has class mentality. They like to pretend they don't but they do.
15:10 those kids in the back are lucky to have parents like that
Totally worth the price.
I stayed in quite a few high end hotels and then discovered that a simple cottage in nature gives me a LOT more happiness and fulfills a strange spot in my soul. High end hotels are sooooo boring.
Wasn't as expensive as I thought
Can't wait to see what it looks like in the future!!!!! Updated, and alive, with people, and lights....
Absolutely worth it! Good show, great vid. Awesome place.
Actually it looks kitschy, vulgar and tacky to me. Not at all in elegant good taste. "Seven stars"??? ... what gimmick.
Daniel James, is that you?
Ne pete pas plus haut que ton Q!
Luxury, Rich, Skycraper.  My mind: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait
Soulless
hey man , you need to learn too much about recording video and talking its not good
7* doesnt exist wow xD
Subscriber from India
It doesn`t look 7 star, probably 4 star as maximum.
Laaammmeeeeeee
Definitely not worth it lol. For that amount of money, I could go to so many other hotels, with everything (including alcohol) inclusive, for several days! This is a total rip-off.
start respecting your collogue and i will think abt subscribing
Living bobby is happy that you got to enjoy this hotel like he did
Very arrogant guest,  everyone should act decent  specially if u are on other country.
1:42 omgg, so clean
not worth it,but maybe for once in a life time experience, it is alright.
5:14 "220% of you haven't subscribed.." - What???  How can you have more than 100% viewers?!?
That Dutch accent bit was gold.
My assistant *wink wink*
Really seven stars...lol....did you really stay there?. As you enter the hotel there is a board put up by Dubai tourism which says the hotel is five star deluxe which is the highest rating available...lol...there is no seven star rating.....
actually there's 3 7 star hotels the one you stayed in was the cheapest
It's worth it for you, but not for us plebs not having a youtube channel 🤣
Worst interior ever .... 🙄🙄🙄
Cannot say I’m impressed with the interior at all. However nice to discover another Youtuber much younger than me living their best life.
Damn every other day I discover a YouTuber living their best life and much younger than me on many occasions.
there is no such thing as an 7 star hotel it's a mythe. It's not the world only seven star hotel. There are 0. look it up on a booking site
Correction it is not a 7 star
When you stay at a 7-star hotel you have to expect it to be very expensive, so don't complain! And why are you throw things on the floor which don't belong to you? This is very rude...
It just looks like a place that's trying to look expensive
oh 1000 smth isn't too bad...i thought it would be a lot more
that is one ugly hotel room
You should have asked for an upgrade to an even uglier room...
After seeing this I realised that my room is better then luxury hotel 😂😁
God still loves you it isn't to late to repent
Over 1,000  dollars and you dont  even get a whole mattress?? 😆Uhhh, nope.
MALAYALEES EE VAZHI POKUVANEEL LIKE ADIKANE
Bammmmmmmmmmm
can't you dress a bit appropriate for such a hotel ?
That Dutch accent made me cry, that was actually pretty good. Cheers from NL!
Arrogant host. Bye
The husky walrus compatibly prepare because gorilla undesirably pass up a exultant teaching. lackadaisical, shaggy breakfast
Who is awarding stars and what do they objectively measure? Slap gold on everything and charge 22 pounds for a glass of ice? I find the whole thing just gross.
The embarrassed eyelash causally stare because cousin identically inform behind a certain soybean. slim, electric profit
Total cheese! 😆 ... and the toilet seat was up!
I Stayed in World's Only 8 Star Hotel
slaves have died for the rich side of dubai. Find it rly crazy how people travel to dubai which is still a country in that you cant kiss openly, woman cant walk around in bikinis and slaves still exist.
Hi, you’re one of the few bloggers than mention the price. You and I are different generations but I really enjoyed this vlog.
Who is gonna tell him that 7 Stars isn't actually a thing?

You are so cute

Not worth it
So, I have a couple questions... 1. What is the story on liquor? Is it allowed? Only wine and beer? 2. What if you “pick someone up”, can you bring them to your room??  I know Muslims take their religion VERY serious and this country doesn’t exactly abide by the concept of “separation of church and State”, so...what are the rules and regulations in regard to this fact? And how do these issues change where women are concerned?
OYO is best, 600 rupiya me mast maja aata h.
The drink and food prices are very reasonable for how nice the hotel is. Maybe do reviews that dont hurt your wallet so much

Highest class hotel, lowest class idiots ruin this video.
conclusion of video "waste of money"
4:58 In actuality, those birds are being paid to stand in formation.
you got me fucked up if you think ima be thinking about money if I go to Dubai. Its Dubai dog! Of course it's gonna be expensive. Bring 10 grand, ball out for a few days, film and dipski outta there 👌
Loved the video.  Slow down talking.
Not as expensive as I thought it would be

Not worth it
Wooow amaziiing bagus banget
I can’t sub for 1 reason the video is interesting but bro you come across so boring
we all love to see things that we cant afford
I tried the challenge but I woke up before it could land 😔😂
So maybe the fog might have seemed kinda shitty timing, but honestly I think it's unique and cool af you got to capture the way it looks.
The private island it showed is the same price as an apartment in the burj khalifa
so....$1583 was your cost?? couldnt be.
To Much complain ? Just enjoy .
Stop being rude to your buddie
not worth it. End of story bros.
Wow,love it
I am middle class ok but my bathroom is bigger than that bathroom 😁😂
Hey guys you should do all of these kinds of reviews. I have watched so many and this is cool like watching a movie. You guys .. young melennials, are the best, chilled and not on your own planet like most of these food/room review couples.
The useful mandolin spontaneously shade because orchestra technically suppose anenst a shaky semicolon. hideous high, harmonious starter
it's not the only 7 star hotel in the world though
Cute
please iphone 12 plus 😂😂
color scheme is terrible and what normal person actually can afford that?
Imagine going to the worlds most luxurious hotel and moaning about how expensive everything is the whole time. Ruined the video for me.
Curious to know what your equipment are? You could probably do a "Whats in my Bag" while you here.
I’d be annoyed that they shoved those two beds together instead of providing a real king mattress!
Hundreds of Indian labourers died to make that hotel. Just FYI.
Welcome to Dubai
He is visiting to world most expensive hotel & complaining how expensive the food & stuff are... 😂
Obviously a nice hotel but I thought the rooms were a little gaudy.
You have 1 friend who lives in the burj Khalifa and 1 friend who lives in burj al arab like wtf
Immature rubbish
what'll you've earn on this video won't be worth what you've spend on it.
We have started calling him Little Bitch Adam, LBA! We have your back Ben
Only 7 stars i saw before was on GTA 😂
U deserve billions of views man 💯
I dint understand why you complain about price when you know Dubai is so expensive, or you should search for prices.
This is hardly different from someone going to stay and promote a North Korean hotel
7 star hotels don't exist,  it's just a marketing scheme
how much did the hotel cost
YOU ARE A DANGER TO SOCIETY
NO USE FUCKING HONEY
Shout out to his family
£1.1k, is that it? Christ, cheap as chips mate
I think that hotel cant believe how stupid people are to pay the ridiculous prices ,they must laugh their heads off every time some nobody checks out.
It's simply a waste of money
This was the most funny think ever!!! You go to a 7 star hotel, you had a pizza and you are afraid to spend money!!!! LMFAO
I thought when you said you called your friend an assistant it was just a slip of the tongue. Now you keep referring to your friend as an assistant. That is a little demeaning.
Im very close to saying it waz worth it... I wish the meals would have all been included
Milano Has a 7 star Hotel
It's great, greetings from Bogota Colombia, I'll go soon
Isn’t there only supposed to be 5 stars?
Don't discriminate your assistant.
So funny as you have sponsors……This video would have been much better if you didn’t talk about money. Problem here is that your sponsors invest a lot of money. I already know that sponsors also pay for all of or part of trips like this. You’re not just sponsored but you endorse. Endorsements are not free to any length.  You have accomplished one thing, going on a sponsored trip and acting as if you spent just your money.
Poor editited video. He barely finishes a sentence before starting a new one.
Stop murdering the other guy😂😂
Just let me correct everyone of you.. Burj Al Arab is not a 7star hotel infact no where in the world a 7star hotel exists. Its just a 5star hotel.
I was just going to school in dubai
Check your facts dude - THERE ARE NO 7 STAR HOTELS. The max is 5 stars.
What's the price he didn't mentioned
Omg,, it's dream! Love from Bangladesh bro🇧🇩
Arabs are extravagant
Where is Glen?
it is not crazy, they just don’t customize.  Thank god you decide not to trash the your hotel room. ’
u go to the same jet ski place as me hahaa
that scam you for the bed.
It's nice experience but for me it's total waste of money.
its honestly a lot more colourful than I expected, I thought it was going to be tacky and gold everywhere but the design is actually very beautiful
so prttyyyyyyyyyy wow
You are very rich
Ok but the real question is why does Adam want footage of a swing ride that fell to the ground and injured 16 people?? 🤔8:10
5:06 thats a view
To stay 7 days there i must work 7 years also why look so emty cuz almost nobody can afford ?
not the best content on the hotel
I'm too poor to be seeing this.
Man kept switching from quid to pound
See video any Indian 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
here's a dirty secret: the more expensive a hotel is, the less is included and the more extra costs you'll have.

He’s too broke to be YouTubing this if you gotta keep complaining about the prices and can’t even take the Rolls Royce. Bye.

I love to visit this hotel
6:35 no matter how expensive the hotel is. This thing is same everywhere!
You're very beautiful but this hotel is ugly, I wouldn't stay if it was free.
Just the bathroom is worth more than my entire life probably....
Hi Ben. Greetings from Canada. (Just subscribed). I want to visit Dubai soon. What category of room did you have? And you said this was the cheapest one? Looks like a palace to me.
Next time you should label this as,” I stayed in the most expensive hotel in the world and was cheap about everything.”
Not very modern looking.  Am I the only one who thinks this place is kinda lame? Not trying to hate, I expected more...
You go to a 7 star. Hotel. N ur a tight arse. £400 for a meal s cheap. Ur definitely not dressed for a 7 star hotel. Didn’t see ur cheap pizza n chicken. A cheap skate vid. 🙃

When they contact the pr department tor the hotel to get free stays and then claim paid for it
Looking forward to staying here
Nice video. Disappointed about the room in this "7" star hotel though.... Not worth the money if you ask me....
tHE NAME IS BURJ'KALIFA
Its not the most expensive hotel.
Brits always complain about anything and everything! And I am a fellow Brit living in the UAE too......no shade intended.
With everything that hotel has it should be expensive.
Everything has to be imported. Every bit of food.
We also visited last lastweek the place it is really amazing and luxurious ❤😊  We made also our vlogs and made 2 parts of the video..  Hope you can visit our channel😊 to see The amazing & luxurious 7 Star hotel in the world.
lol wait this is the exact room that that other guy got, whats his name LivingBobby.....it must be the cheapest room for sure lol
Dope place. But not worth it tbh
There is no 7* rating. It's just a marketing ploy as usual. Architect is British, Tom Wright, construction company, Atkins, is British, Jumeirah Group run by British and European. Money sloshed in from UAE. They have no clue about design, construction, style, sophistication or business.
Should of gone to Butlins with your partner you both wouldn’t know the difference,  crying over £20 chicken what did he expect Aldi prices.....
In 2009 I stayed at Mina a Salam, a Hotel right next to Burj al Arab. When you stay there you have full access to Burj al Arab. I went there for dinner several times.
I jst want to laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sorry 😂😂😂😂
I wanna see a livingbobby X Ben Morris collab 😅
If you are crazy rich and conside the facilities I personally think this is worth it. Unfortunately we are not crazy rich
So kitsch 🤮
I dont get it. Why its not all inclusive?
You are so cheap how many times you mentioned how much it cost you 🤨 and how many times you said my assistant 🤔 he doesn’t have a name
You are so cheap how many times you mentioned how much it cost you 🤨 and how many times you said my assistant 🤔 he doesn’t have a name
Bro there are 7 star hotels in india visit Taj in Mumbai and Taj in Hyderabad
Imagine what would happen if he actually broke the Vase.  Hahaha bloody hell
the dream
The rooms looks quite old fashioned...but i guess that's the design of it
It's not the only one actually
While I didn't stay at the hotel, my Mom and I got to experience the Afternoon Tea at Skyview Bar back in late 2015.  Was pretty expensive but I'd say totally worth it!  Didn't want to blow our vacation budget to stay at the hotel proper though, but it's wonderful to see you guys having a blast and being silly ;).
I think it is worth it.
Brutal treatment of a friend. You seem very hung up on money and that .. you... are paying.
Complaining like couple of little bitch until the end exactly they don’t serve British tea in a little tea pot or apple cider 🤣
Where are the hot chicks??
I wouldn't go for free. I feel guilty just watching.
Such an overrated hotel. Such a watse of money.
Beautiful camera work
very good
Love how’s he’s so money savy 😂😂
Editing sucks and it's a headache watch the video, thumbs down 👎
Wow this is actully very expensive in my country it’s thousands
Looks like a king castle
Only 7 star hotel ?
hey, ben i will accept your beach bag flip tomorrow.
the moment i saw the slipper transition, i subscribed.
Hitman 3 vibes
That hotel looks like a sanitary towel
It isn't the only 7 star Hotel, there's one in Milan too...
Very nice vlog. Well done.
The designs are terrible and overrated.
I worked there
im proud because you came to my cuntry and to see what we live in
What a Hotel 😇😇😇!!!
Too much b roll man. U say one sentence and then back to b roll
Everything looks amazing except the interior design it's so fucking ugly
Calling your friends your assistants is a great way to lose friends
if that`s what we call cheap than imagine the expensive
There are 3 seven star hotels in the World. 2in dubai and 1 in Italy
Was it worth it? Ans: NOT AT ALL !! they just robbed you smiling mate
Literally No one :  Ben Morris every 5 secs :  "This video has cost me a lotta money"
Moral of the video : He is living life !
5:03 it sounds like there is water in ur here😂😂
This needs to blow up so he can make his money back 😆
as someone who lives in Dubai, these prices are INSANE! if your thinking about visiting you wont see these prices everywhere.
great video, however it was annoying to hear you always complaining about the prices...
I miss visiting Dubai :)
Looks overrated Hotel to me..
isn't this the 'Hotel Oasis' of mw3 where Makarov died?
It IS expensive, but actually not that expensive. I know a lot of hotels that charge more than that/night that definitely not a 7 star.
Crazy expensive
I mean we all knew, including you, this was an expensive stay...no point in repeating yourself 10 times throughout the video. I think it would be more appropriate to say it once at the end of your video when you summarize it all
This is expensive because the fruits are actually real.
it was very worth it
Gd content mate.. i spent a year in the uae....biggest rip off ever! Decent experience over.
It is not a 7 star hotel is “self proclaimed 7 star hotel” and I am the God
Very nice, but the first and still active 7stars hotel is in Milan inside the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele.
Rewatched this and MAN 9:03 is one of the best editing I have seen on Youtube. Another banger Ben
Not the only 7 star hotel
You rich ass
That's penny bills for Jeff Bezos😂😂😂
Inspiring can't wait to visit Dubai and live the luxury myself
Thanks for giving us this vicarious experience. 👍👍👍
I can't even afford to plan a trip to Dubai.. going is way out of my league .. but I can't even think 🥺🥺
Is that a room a house
I hope you didn't forget your flip flops and sliders mate xD
Can we appreciate how he is so good at editing 🤧😌
I’ve went thir before
Great video but...travel, hugging friends, what? Is Covid over in Dubai?
The interior is ugly AF even though the view is magnificent.
I guess Ben is one of the influencers who had to make this essential journey breaking the lockdown rules to film this then...
worth it mannnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
I rolled up to this hotel in 2010 ish. With a cheap rental car. The guy at the gate said I wasn't allowed in. I said why not? He said cause I wasn't a guest. Makes sense. Then he said you can't get in also cause you don't have a coller shirt. I said I'm going to go buy one. He said OK. So I called him out on it. I went and bought one and drove up. He was still there and let me in. I was absolutely shocked. I thanked him so much a tiped him generously. Pretty much when I was inside it was free rain. The top restaurant was insane. I only stayed 1hr but it was awesome.
😂 bathroom space and my room space are same wtf😂😂
who wish they can just live in this room for only one night
Looks tacky and outdated in a way.
Has anyone ever told you that you sound exactly like Britain's famous diver, Tom Daley?!
smh cheaped out in dubai go back to ur slum
Am I the only one mad at not every thing is free like drinks and food etc like why. AND WHY DOES THE WIFI SUCK IF YOU ARE SPENDING THOUSANDS A NIGHT LIKE WHY

Bali - 7 star hotel. Been many times.
Theres a 7 star in turkey too
They scammed you in several ways.  1. There are several 7 star hotels in the world 2. It's only a 7 star hotel because a journalist said for fun that 5 stars were not enough So basically you were in an expensive 5 star hotel, lol.
I thought only 5 year olds liked startling birds for fun.
You want air?     It’s $500
two eggs in a video
Ben i have visited this hotel but I don't have much money to stay overnight  :(
6:51why does that remind me of the stranger things music
song at 6:25?
This is not the only one 7 star hotel in the world maaan
I went there for a 3 day stay and brrooooo amazing experience!😍😍
Question is when was this filmed, before UK lockdown or during?
Alternate tittle: virgins land on 7 star hotel. Like you don’t know what the bathroom bench is for? Holy crap, hope you learn that lesson soon.   When you do, you will also learn you don’t take a friend here. Its meant to take the hottest chick in you country.
I can afford a Bottle of water there
Actually there are more than seven, 7 star hotels over the world.
Not the only one but all right
well nobody in the comment section wont ever be doing the Burj Al Arab beach bag flip
SELF-PROCLAIMED 7 star hotel ... Standard is amazing but cmon guys it's not 2 stars ahead of some other masterpiece hotel. This is highly overrated but at least it's a good marketing idea on their behalf
I wouldn't go to a country where the king is torturing his daughter who he doesn't even knows and who he is probably going to kill. No good money spending.
me a middle class teen watching this knowing I will never be able to afford this 😭
Dubai 🤮
Taj Mahal in mumbai is better and worth
it s very worth it                           for the hotel owners
what a boring bloke
10 pounds for gummy bears o.o They better have gold on them, cause damn...
I personally do not think it worth 7 stars at all, having stayed there couple of times
What is the whole point of staying in a hotel where you can't even get a peaceful night (Peaceful :- Without thinking of the expenses, Just a good sleep and something good to eat).
It’s. NOT the only one in the world, there is one in Milan for example
How much was this one night in  $ Canadian Dollars ?
imagine stealing just a little gold aha
Boys 😂😂@13:22
Assistant? Bro this is not good. I just not subscribed you because of your words. Because What you told him. 👎
There is a 7 start hotel in Georgia too lol. Do your research man
It's not the only 7 Stars Hotel stupid
There's nothing pointless it's dope
This is not a 7 Star hotel, even Jumeirah group denies it.
There are many 7 stars hotel out there.
Actually, I thought he was a disrespectful asshole! I turned him off !
Burj Al Arab is the World's First 7 star hotel not the "Only" 7 star hotel. There's also the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi which is also a 7 star luxury hotel.
It looks old, there’s just a lot of gold
Room should have own pool, this is not 7 star hotel, its more like 4*.
You deserve more subscribers love from India

PKR (245,762 )
No, you didn’t stay in the world’s only 7 star hotel. Do you know why? Because there is no such rating. There isn’t even a 6 star. It’s a ridiculous self-inflated accolade that doesn’t exist. The global hotel rating system has a maximum of 5 stars. That’s it, end of discussion.
That only aroun 1.2 lakh indian rupees i have heard rumours that it cost 16 lakh rupees
I also livede there but iam now at the emaar hotel 👍
Sick hotel, but 7-star hotels don't exist...
The furniture and colour scheme looks like that of an old persons home….. I was expecting something really nice.

Your staff is too much good !

Burj Al Arab Costs - $1 Billion Antilia - $3 Billion 😅😅
Who else thinks that the hotel just looks too busy with unnecessary colours and patterns.. besides that, this is generally a good video, clarity and editing is on top!
UNNECESSARY
Orange county resort costs more than that
Great documentation!
He is underrated but when he blurred the price on the thumbnail it was 3259$
I don't mind sleeping in the bathroom guys.
This is the first video that i watched on your channel, your content is quite amazing . And ... the answer to your question is ..... it was a nice room but not worth coz same facilities we can easily get in a 5 star hotel with a lot less price and go on another dream destination😬😬 with saved money❤️
I’m overwhelmed by your video Ben! You are really talented. I hope my videos will be as good as yours one day!
This hotel doesn't meet the requirements of a 7star hotel. Anyone will get a room like this for just $800.
FOA there is no 7 star hotel in this world right now officially. But the services they provide is 7 star  so its not a 7 star hotel actually but you got that so called 7 star facilities.
Super
you are so underrated omg your amazing!
Money has left the chat!
It's just the views that I loved other than that the interior of the suite was mehhh. Btw nice video bro
I don't think you came in hotel I think that you came in paradise. This is really sick
North Korea has a 42 star hotel...
I do thin its worth it for like a 1 in a lifetime experience Bloody L
No, you didn’t as there’s no such a thing as 7* hotel.   5* is max and everything else is just marketing bullshit
🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪
Class video Ben. What a stunning hotel 🔥
Bro I am from India and I went to that hotel and when I came backs to India I went broke
Who's ur assistant xx
nice hotel just to have a look , everything else in my opinion is a rip off
Dubai is so soulless
Added to my bucket list 🤠
Okay, I'm not a fan of their interior but the view is magnificent.
I got recommendation today and I subbed today.
i miss like these vlogs
Burj Al Arab owner : we're going to be bankrupt  *After giving to people rooms back to the game*
Can u go to maldives resorts
Awesome 😍
I cant believe he has just about 600k and hes making these time of videos, keep up the good work man
Whats the camera?
Ben's videos are underated, banger!
I live in dubai lol
9:05 can we appreciate that transition
Ben: I think this is the cheapest room in this hole place   Me: yea you might not want to say cheap 🤣
Ben is the only YouTuber that I don't skip 15 seconds when he talks about his sponsorers.
1. Their are no official 7 Star hotels 2. Their are many hotels, which are inofficial 7 Star. For example emirates palace abu Dhabi or one hotel in Mailand
why do rich people disgust me
This is Sheit xD
its actually 5 star if you search it up.
My grandma is a millionaire there in Dubai,we go there every yearly for Christmas! :D
How much money did it cost
adventurous
haha i remember when i was younger i went for afternoon tea there
It is a self called 7 star hotel... But still a damn nice hotel!
''Interesting pattern'' .. in reference to a standard paisley pattern, lmao.
A hotel that expensive doesnt come with free drinks and they call it 7 star? Get out im already dissapointed
that's bigger then my flat
Do buy😂
Tbh bullshit. there are 17 7 Star Hotels in the world
Cyprus is now making a 7star hotel
The rooms are great but somehow feel rather dated now.
That room reminds me of a rich pirate ship
dude I've been next to that. my dude does not realise the fucking amount of jellyfish there
It’s not the only 7 star at world, there is another one in Milan
You should go and see super car blondi
Good vid bro, love how real you are with us, things are a bit to expensive, when I was there we stayed at the palm hotel 🥰
Too too underrated. Videos are amazing 👏
Been there too but I didn't stay for the night, only ordered mineral water in their restaurant 🤣 It was only $10 thought so it wasn't crazy overpriced. Staff was very professional despite me wearing backpackers clothes etc
Absolute legend 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Overpriced shat
last year my family and me got to stay there and im so grateful for it
can't believe the old IMac they have in the rooms !!!
You are about 18-20 years late to the party....the 7 stars nonsense came from some travel magazine..BAA has never claimed it..there is no such a thing as 7 stars...this thing has aged worst then an avocado...BAA is a old old story in Dubai
There is actually no such thing as a 7 star hotel.  They only go up to 5 Star.  They can't just make their own star rating.
It’s not the only 7-star hotel. They are rare but there are a few. But I’ll give this to you cause this one is definitely the most infamous
does the hotel come with a trip to wild wadi water park?
The best video i watched in your vlog. Good bless to you ben.
Your assistant is supper funny lol
There is a 7 star hotel in Venezuela
13:27 That bed is probably more expensive than my house is
which smartwatch is he using?
his mate looks like that guy from young offenders😂😂
Why is no one talking  about the mirror above the bed, it’s kinda weird
Goat!!!
It's a 5 star hotel, its not possible to be over 5 stars.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back soon and that will be turned into ashes, get saved now.
Why he telling his friend “ohhh you didn’t pay for this” smh white people
Wild wadi is the best I’ve been before
The cost of the hotel is relative to how much money you have. For most it wouldn’t be worth it. Unless they got it for free.
Look out for the Hitman 3 in there.
Imagine being a 7 star out of 10 and having expensive cars bring you to it. I can get a 10 out 10 which has crap in the pools.
Saying don't piss in the toilet before me even as a joke, I'd have pissed all over the furniture so you got the damage bill 😂
That is so cool a waterpark near the hotel
This hotel looks azaming to dear
How is his uber a tesla
For everyone complaining about the style, this style is true middle eastern. They were going for a more arabic feel. since it is an arabic city. The blue is representing the palm since it's your view. The whole vibe is supposed to be classy and try to arabic style.
Awesome 👌
That table lamp light at 12:15 is the exact same thing you can buy on AliExpress for like $15 lmao.
me already thinking about my future job at that hotel 😂
9:05 THAT TRANSITION BROOOO
Overuse of gold just makes it look tacky.
Are you in Dubai now?
POV: your from Australia and don’t know how much it costed
yo wanna meet up
Hey Ben can u Make a video about staying in Burj Khalifa for a day It would be really cool
all those costs to stay there, and the faucet and shower head water runs shittier than lower classes😂. and when u guys were jumping onto the bed i guessed it was 2 beds 💀. ur content is amazing though! glad u get to go on these adventures
Wait your in United Arab Emirates? Dubai.
Is it me or does the building look like a ps5? 5:21
When an hotel room design cost more than your whole house lol
even the rolls are dated there
They make it rain in dubai with planes like not even a conspiracy theory they actually do it lol
Honestly that is a lot less than I thought it would cost.
Maybe travel to Greece next year, not just Santorini but other islands (there are 6000 islands in Greece and they are ALL beautiful and are full of history).  I would suggest, Rhodes, Mykonos, Milos, Meganisi, Crete, Kastellorizo, Icaria and Santorini.    There are wayyyyyyy too many to name out, but in my opinion the top ones are here (there are many more tops that I have but I just named some out that I remember by heart.)
9:02 is sooo clean
am i the only one who thought it was skeppy?
Changing of the guards. Casey passes to Ben. Great to see it, great content, keep it coming
I expected to be like 3000-6000£ cause i know its gonna be expensive but its ok. Its like an iPhone 12 pro max price. This is dead cheap for those dubai prince
Some people don't know that hotels are rated till 5 star.rhere is no thing like 7 start.
This isn’t the worlds only 7 star hotel
Any good cocktail in London is £25 at least I don't know what you're talking about...
The interior design still has "insane" style. I expected it to be more, actually. Yes, it was worth it! 😁
everyone like the video it cost you nothing and the amount he spent on this video it would help him out
UH?????
U can take everything in the room for free
What’s your second YouTube channel called????
So nobody is going to talk about the mirror above the bed...giving me Fifty Shades of Gray vibes
Looks dead. Stayed in nicer 5 stars
What Camera equipment do you use? The quality is INSANEEEEE
My parents went there
2:15 you look and sound like you’re about to cry
YOU SHOULD VISIT SAUDI ARABIA 🤙
My nephew, who lives in Dubai, is 7 years old and obsessed with Burj Al Arab for some reason. Anyway, I think the rooms and the hotel itself is very outdated and certainly not worth the money. I’ve stayed in tons of 5 star properties across the world that are miles better and cheaper than this.
How much wa it
I spent 10 days in Dubai and it was the best trip ever. It is like Vegas on mega steroids! Where else can you buy gold bars from a vending machines, where the police drive Lamborghinis and you can go skiing indoors?? Dubai! Can’t wait to return one day! The Burj Al Arab is a beautiful hotel but to me it’s outdated and goddie!
16:09 that scream had me dyinggggggggggg
The place is humongous, was expecting a small kitchen somewhere 😕  I hate it when hotels push beds together 🤦🏾‍♀️
I rode a jetski and had pictures done around that hotel. It's so cool! It is always foggy in Dubai though, you probably filmed this the day my friends and I went jet skiing. We had reservations for 10am but didn't end up being able to make it to jetskiing until 2 or 3pm because of the fog. 😬 Dubai is very boujee but I love it! (I live in Abu Dhabi right now).
Expensive = 7 stars
Did he forgot to say how much it cost him at the end ?
I think the beaches and water in Cancun (Mexico) are much more beautiful, i saw a clip recently a video there and i was impressed, good job👌❤🔥
12:15 Half of what you said were Greek food "Kalamari (Καλαμαρι)". Everyone takes ideas from the Greeks but loveeeeee Dubai bro I want to go there once I get enough money lol
We Live in Dubai and yet to go in the Burj Al Arab :) :) hopefully we get to go in it one day and definitely will be vlogging it :)
I’ll take all the little soaps after 😂😂
Am I the only one who thinks that the hotel looks a little tacky lol
Luv from Dubai!!
You should have tried the indoor pool it’s much better
Too many adverts, too greedy
Worth it. Keep it up.
This hotel is like Versace inspired lol
bruh ive seen better hotels, just a rate doesnt mean anything
I thought it would be more expensive than that
Tackiest place I’ve ever seen..... yuck.
it was worth it
5 star Ritz Paris is much better than this
living the best life
I stayed in the Hilton by the creek (about GBP80 a night) and thought that was amazing so this was unreal, but USD1,100 is crazy. I think most of the what you pay for alcoholic drinks is probably tax. A pint of Heineken in the Hilton is GBP10.00, but there's plenty of bars in London probably charge that now.
Why is this dude not at a million subs already like if he should
You should go to the savoy, it’s probably better than this
I’ll just stick to a premier inn
This hotel room is a let down
The decor gives me going on a cruise vibes
This made 6star hotels look poor
This YouTube channel is so underrated!!
Thanks for the tour.  Absolutely, not worth the massive amount of money to stay there, eat, drink, etc.
You know there are more 7 star hotels in the world
The transitions😍
He’s not Scouse he’s from Birkenhead
Literally self proclaimed 7 stars so they can charge more. The system should only go up to 5. Its kinda the point of a scale. Its like saying 15 out of 10
Wow lov it
Is Adam your editor? Or just your friend
Lol I stayed at intercontinental too and hired that same red lambo
bro u said Arab correctly in the beginning, lool nice
13:57 Kim is hilarious loool, get him in more videos
The cinematic shots of your room though...😍
Theren’s also a 7 star hotel Shekhvetili, Georgia 🇬🇪. With a 150m pool stretching into the sea, a giant aquarium with sharks, a private water park, a private beach and a botanical garden
I don't feel like it's worth it at all. I guess beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I rather spend money on everything outside my room. I barely stay in the room only for the night.  Gold to me is just a metal and diamond just a tightened up piece of carbon. Enjoy the little things.
Wow that’s so expensive
I'm so jealous 😫
Why all the time you have to say uuu this is soo expensive, so muuch money.?
I love your vlogs Ben. One of my favourite vloggers, thank you for giving us quality entertaining content 👍🙏😎😎😎
Yes 😍🤩
Insane!
It is an experience something you have to see and not think about the price
Thats fantastic
Bruh my man said elevator even though it’s lift and he’s BRITISH so it should be lift😂
This is a rich hotel, but it’s overdone
ur videos are so good...u put sm effort into them! Its really appreciated x
I was expecting it to be more expensive tbbh
4:39 music?
the architecture was insaneeee
you are making me insanley jealous
There’s no such thing as a 7 star hotel
The burj costing that much is just a waste of money and not worth it at all it’s just unnecessary gold everywhere what benefit r u gonna get out of looking at gold
No not worth it
If 1 man with 1 channel can do this then the Sidemen should be able to go here with all their channels and yes I know... It'll probably cost them over 100k for all of them to stay for 1 night
Whats the song playin when he’s in the pool?
Your videos just keep getting better and better!!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for Ben
Worth it for a special occasion or if you got money to burn
Free comments to get bens money back
Free comments to get bens money back
Free comments to get bens money back
I’m just here to comment to help Ben get his money back I can hear the pain of him talking bout how expensive it is 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤩🤩😭
220% not subbed ?
What an amazing video!!!
Why does his voice go up at the end of every sentence !!!!!
how much did it cost him?
It's definitely an old style decor style
Did he even get all the free accessories
Cool editing and great content love it!
Hotel looked amazing!
You have to be a classical fan to appreciate this room decor. Personally I’m a fan of modern designs so I would prefer a JW Marriot or Hilton over this. That’s just me
Living the dream x
World's only 7 Star hotel?? Common 😄😂
601k subs woop cheers for this content Ben
Kudos to ya Ben, in lockdown you have really lightened ny days and given me a “holiday” in these great places u visit. Keep up the amazing work 😀
I like premier inn more
There’s no fresh flowers in the room so this technically isn’t even 5 star haha. Seriously tho I’m not impressed just looks like a standard penthouse but covered in unnecessary gold 🥴
Thanks youtube for Recommend Me This High Quality Video
Man said cheapest room👀
I went here it looked so beatiful from the outside.. there was even a porsche outside at the beach for show..
I was aked to leave skyview in 2011 because we were told Donald Trump was doing something on the right (when looking from the inside toward the sea) of the place and his goons were standing on the floor you step down onto blocking off about 3/4 of the place  as we entered from the left. He was no one then so me and my friend just sat down and ignored them (Never saw him, there is lots of curvy stuff in the way). Then hotel staff came and told us we need to leave, they were very nice about it though. Probably good since a simple burger was 1,800 Dirham. Great experience. Go do the desert drive.
Everyone went home last night and Adam is about to come round now.... lol Whatever😂
Amazing content as always expecting more videos :)
not worth it
If you close your eyes he sounds like Ali-A
the shots of the pool were so beautiful
🌈💙💚💜🧡💛⭐
SO FUCKING UNDERRATED
He’s done it before the sidemen surely!
That's not dated interior. That's the traditional interior in Dubai.
What, how much!! Complains in scouse accent
lmfao iPhone 12+ ?
How can they afford this?
anyone down to put all of our money together and get 1 room
Was it worth it? No. £1,000 for 1 night in a hotel? Much rather spend 1 month in Bali comfortably.
That is a long long way from the best hotel in dubai
Film a video at Nusr_et Steakhouse..☺️🥩
Its not outstanding for the price
Gentleman's Kit. Pah.
Ben: And here's my Assistant, Other Guy: Stop Calling Me That!!! ------- Whoops. 😆
Ive been to that water park
was not worth it
Ben you make the coolest videos dude, like the young Casey Neistat 🙌
16:17 hey I went on that as well it was too fun
Imagine how rich u could get from mining the gold in there 😂
Not really worth it but that room was so tasteless it was untrue! Dubai may have money but it doesn't guarantee style
I stayed here for 1 night - I definately didn't flood the bathroom :| For a 7 star hotel you'd think the seal on the shower would be better 😂
He could make his money back by selling those slippers and flip-flops on eBay.
*that's* the cheapest room?? wow how much was it
Wow 🤩 it looks amazing. Also I really wanna go jet skiing now it looks so fun
this was such a cool vlog! such an experience! :D
I think that Dubai looks like a horrible place. So ostentatious and fake. I'd rather be in Margate.
HITMAN 3 first mission be like :
I’m confused is he English from uk or dubi
Ben’s content must be up there with one of the best on the platform. So underrated. The quality of content alone deserves so many more subs.
Congrats on 600k mate!
Is it just me or is the guy really mean and condescending towards his friend/assistant🤔🤔
How is this man only got 600k madddd
I'd come visit you if I knew you were here :(((
subscribed:     shh not subscribed: 220% lol
Every video 220% of you aren't subscribed makes sense
what about the price???
11:58 it looks like a ps5
Actually quite cheap
Horrible room
BEN URE DIFFERENT
happy to see u living ur best life xoxo proud dad
its literally 4.7 star rating ffs
Is he actually your assistant?
600k btw
I do like the content he creates but all the videos I watch he just seems to complain about people watching and not subbing, and he did nothing but complain about prices this video! Came across as a bit of a dick to be honest, don't think I'll watch anymore
Ben brings out some amazing content!
Respect to Ben. Been a follower since 100k and his editing and video ideas are 💯. On the road to a million subs...
I wonder why this is 7 stars, I have seen far cheaper hotels that are a 100 times more beautiful than this, so I am wondering whats the point of going to this hotel? Why do people want to go to this hotel?
600k 🎉
that slipper transition was so fireeeee
Correction: The 7 stars awarded by themselves. The hotel star rating officially doesn't go to 7 stars.
Ben your my second favourite youtuber your so underrated and your just short from the sidemen channel but there a group so basically my favourite YouTuber😅👍
I think the hotel room, is worth every penny. It's the experience!
Hey mate, I'm just a kid from London who lives in Dubai and I would recommend to go to IMG worlds of adventure, it would make a great video!!
that slipper transition thou woah boi
Your content is fucking class
steel the gold in the toilet roll holder
Can we just talk about how Ben is literally in Dubai living and chasing his dreams. My inspiration
*"Complains in scouse"* had me dead lmao
There is a hotel in bur dubai called grand hayat and its the best value for money hotel ever
One word mate, " GOLD " 💯
I actually went to that water park and did that drop slide thing
your videos are so so good Ben! keep doing what you're doing!
Only if Glen was here
That transition to the editing was smooth
7 stars, just like the quality of Bens videos.  Over the years Bens content has gone from good to nigh on perfect.  Very enjoyable. Well done young man, I wish you all success.
Why would his friend need a passport if she wasn’t staying
I went on the drop slide 🥲💀😂
I think it’s prolly worth it if your a millionaire cuz it prolly like nothing to them lol
I went the Jermira beach hotel next to it, it’s all very nice
its not fucking sated, its a diffrent type of inteiror deign that is used in Duabi
£1200 for the room, services, food and the trip? thought it was gonna be like 5k
His best vid till now, absolutely nailed it mate!!
theres actually a seven star hotel in the country georgia
This proves that money doesn't buy taste of style
*complains in scouse*
“Unfortunately I couldn’t be on the interior design team” 🤣 Ben would go off on that design tho ngl
tbh i thought it would’ve been more but ben is one of the most underrated youtuber out there
Surprised this man doesn’t have at least a few million subscribers
gutted there is no all inclusive haha
This is the 600th comment. Nice video
Loved it
Definitely not worth it but really cool video idea!  Keep it going Ben!
This whole video is literally Ben complaining bout how expensive everything is 😂
Look like ten days back in dubai it was do foggy
Congrats on 600K
Ive been to wild wadi and that scary ride
You’re cute, don’t worry I’ll tell all my girls to subscribe to you xx💜💜
the edits, the transitions, the dedication. everything is just top notch
money well spent in mate
that was not worth it..
Fun watching this video
looked like a tacky place to stay lol wtf 1.1k f that trash
Can he do "I spent 7 days in the quarantine hotel" so we can see if it's  worth the risk 😂
Congrats on 600k ben
Looks at the mirror above the bed - "would be great if you were playing chess" HAHA
You didn't do a cost breakdown in the end.  Kinda dissapointed . 😰
Id say the stay at burj al arab was worth it
Banging video mate they keep getting better and better
This is what I call quality content! Congratulations on 600k Ben! 🔥
Wayyy 600k well done
on a real note how does one have 220% non-subscribers tho lol
What happened to the other 6?
Ben you're the most underrated youtuber I have ever seen, I hope you get Millions of subs, luv yah
Banger, as usual. Thanks mate🙌🏻
Scouse? Nailed on wool him
Be careful asking for a gentle men's kit from 2 guys.  They'll throw you from the roof.
Amazing content as always
I actually like the color schemes. Reminds me of a living Moroccan rug.
Congrats on 600k so underrated 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Where is Glenn
Stays in the only 7 star hotel and does nothing but moan about the price of things... Did ya think it'd be cheap or something lol
Simon Wilson and Ben should collaborate together.
In my opinion , since ur doing the video u might have as well paid for the nice expensive restaurant and rolls Royce it’s not everyday u experience stuff like that and might as well do it for the content  . But great video
13:17 that transition tho 😍😍😍
Do subscribe BEN MORRIS please!
you can stay in much much nicer hotels in nicer places for much less money. It's pretty tacky to be honest. I agree with you the colour scheme is shite. And the overuse of gold is a cheap way to claim it's exclusive in some way.
Another quality video 🙌🏽
600k damnnn, love the vids
not worth it apsoloutely not i wouldnt spend that much on a week there maybe a month for that price
I could not afford to be your friend dude!
Finally treating your self and I hope you’ve been seing what the big uk you tubers been saying about you your the most creative you tuber in uk and your brother proud 💙💙
Not worth it but considering you can pay $30000 for a flight it is kind of worth it I mean if your rich your rich go ham
wow nice. I think it is wor4th it
Looks like a giant tampon
wow
Stands on the scales - gosh I'm heavy, must be just full of s. today.
The room tour montage ??? *chef’s kiss
"Hype Hotel" its not worth it at all.
Your content is insane !!!!!
I think a star or two should be knocked off the hotel rating
Jmx bens brother 🤯🤯🤯
How much did it cost then?
He said his room was the cheapest I don’t even. Wanna imagine what the most expensive one looks like
Always a quality video if its a Ben Morris video!!
9:05 That was so smooth, had to watch it twice!
*Congrats on 600k!*
This guy deserves a follow and like
Your channel is so underated. Amazing content that takes alot of effort.
7 star my arse I've seen much better
I had no idea jmx was ur brother 🤣🤣🤣
He’s just so underrated Ben mate u deserve a lot more
Ben: I suppose you could call where we're going a beach... Proceeds to go into a swimming pool 😂
15:02 LOOK ITS A MERMAN IN A BED !!!!!
Wheres glenn ?
Ben is so underrated he really deserves more followers
Put down the toilet seat and wash your hands! Lol
can you do the money translations into english please👍
CONGRATS ON 600K BEN
How has Ben not got ATLEAST 1mill subs yet ?! 🤯
Glen would have made this vid way better
How he have the money for all of this
Congrats on 600K
How did you meet Adam I mean your assistant
Seems overrated, think you could have such a good time spending that money somewhere else and living like a king
bro...the hotel should employ you to make their trailer, love your montages of the room. Dope vid as always
Good content
This is the content I love
His channel rn: 📈📈📈
Is this were the princess os kidnapped?
Rich kid makes a YouTube account
The birds just did not expect that devastating attack
Great vid Ben👏🏻
Gg on 600k
That boy living life like no other. Been subbed for the longest so crazy that you haven’t hit 1 mil yet but it’s all about the journey it’ll come with time
Waste of money. Could of donated it to charity
Wonder how Ben's kitty is
Congrats on 600K you deserve it :)
The first and only scouser to step foot in a 7 Star Hotel
The building looks like ps5
13:55 Hahaha dat Nederlandse accent! Geweldig 😂
Anyone else remined by the sidemen reacts video?
Bro this guy’s filming skills are insane
Ahhhh yay you hit 600k! It’s so well deserved
Most under rated youtuber
I was in Dubai this time last year, love that city, hopefully be back again in November, inshallah
congrats on 600k subscribers!
Talented don
Everyone like and comment he needs the money!!!
HES DONE IT AGAIN  congrats on 600k
I hope ben wins a best YouTuber award he deserves it more than anyone 🙏🏆👑💯
Amazing video
I done that slide when I was 7
600k let’s go
Know we know that ben i oficaly rich$$$$$
every video gets better and better
who else saw sidemen reacts do a vid on the hotel?
Love the content keep up the hard work bro 💯💯💯
Bro does YouTube really pay yall this much money? Cause if that's the case, all you creators/influencers have literally been holding out and keeping secrets. Cause y'all know damn well EVERYBODY would be on YouTube if they knew lol
congrats on 600k
this makes me wanna go to dubai so bad!
The colour coordination is terrible but it’s a nice place I would say it’s probably not worth it in my opinion but glad u enjoyed it mate
Ive been there i totally understand what you mean
Sick
Wort it
Bro I swear this deserves millions of likes.
he’s so fine
Ben is living the life
ben what camera do you use I'm so interested in cinematography so let me know :)
this hotel shouldn't be worth more than £400-500/night. 1.4k/night (according to google) is just purely ridiculous , not to mention the food/drink prices. unless u are a multi-billionaire, u can't afford this hotel >.<
that sleigh looking sofa is called a chaise longue (if you wanted to know)
Glenn looks different in this video
how did u go there cuz of covid
some of the gold was just unnecessary like it ruined the interior
Ben you good mate? You're content is good enough but this.... 😳
no glen TODAY
Ben: ‘Maybe it’s someone’s ashes’
My parents were going to climb to the top but my dads scared of heights so they didn’t really get to do it!
'when you come in person...' thanks Ben for making us believe we could afford this
Ben congrats on 600k most underrated youtuber I’ve ever seen this guy deserves at least 5 million
ngl thought it woulda been more than just a grand
the quality of the video dude... idk.. <3
Why is no one mentioning the slipper transition 👍🏽 inside man our Ben
Your so underrated brilliant videos and still you aren’t on million subscribers it’s mad
There's such a thing as too much gold, and this was it for me
Comment
Happy 600k!
I went there when I was three but I havnt since
10:09 *Complains in scouse* hahaha
How much did it cost ??
dont be part of the 220%
🤙🏼🤙🏼
Why didn't he give the price at the end like he said ?
the transition when he showed the slippers was so smooth
Trim looking fresh
This guy is living the life eveyone dreams of
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
With the money saved with shoptager you could stay in Bens hotel room for about 229 years ;)
Best YouTuber ❤️
Finally 600k subs well done 👍
Yes, I think it's worth it. Great video also.
These videos are nothing but inspirational 👏🏽
It's all nice cool and stuff but... I'm stuck at home, can't travel can't afford luxury lifestyle. I wanna see real life in Dubai.
appreciate all the effort you put into your vids dude!
Okay your content is sooo good go sub
I kinda like that hes underrated, can watch Ben all day long!
Man is amazed at the urus but walks past the Aventador sv
Underrated 🐐
Not underrated, but appreciated. Thanks Ben!
They are completely taking the piss with their prices tbh , as if you're not paying enough for the hotel itself 😒
Join Yes Theory
Imagine this flopping
Great vlog.  The hotel price I didn’t think was that bad for what it is.  The food was tho lol. Stay safe.  Love your vlogs !
Why is no one talking about the slipper transition, that was so cool!
Bruh, That's rom is bigger than my house.
if u live in dubai like
Content beast, Ben Morris 😤🔥
I'm sorry but I cannot stay in a hotel one cuz the tacky decorations can't even
So not worth it. Tacky
it looks almost too fancy ya know.
I remember it being built years ago every year wed go to jumierah beach hotel without doubt one of the best fmaily hotels in the world. However we use to go over to the burj for dinner al munt ta ha. Fun fact I once fell into the water fountain no jokesand got taken to the dry cleaners downstakrs
best content on youtube
Amazing videos. I live my dream holidays through you xx
claim your here before 1 million views ticket
That’s a big footstool not a coffee table😂😂😂😂
Doesn't that hotel have a tennis court on the top??
I was in Dubai last week. Ohh I miss this lovely weather 😀
I think the hotel was quite overrated imo
Dope
Congrats on 600k
Best time of the week! Keep it up Ben😇❤️
WHY HAS HE NOT BLOWN UP YET??!!! The work ethic + content + awesomeness = success .... what’s going on
not my style looks tacky and over lavish
How does he not have a mil im acc hurt
XD Its a chaise longue lol  Slay indeed
there's so much gold the room actually looks cheap tbh
What hair products do you use Ben?
Hi Ben
we miss glen
Was so no worth it, you barely got any inclusive with the hotel which just made you pay more and the hotel didn’t even look nice
Great video. I'm not convinced to pay that much to stay there. Take away the gold and the room feels average imo.
If YouTube have allowed, I would have liked his all videos more then millions time
"Complains in scouse" 😂 You're mate must get vexed being around you
Congrats on 600k!
I'm sooo jealous, let me travel too
Isn't there a 7 star hotel in turkey somewhere
600k 🎉🎉🎉🎉
share with ur Homies pls dis deserves 6.7 million views not 50k.
Not worth it
Take a shot every time he says beach bag
How much did it cost?
It might have 7 stars but not my style . Tacky but nice pool
Hi Ben! I would like to know what camera you use?
“Incase you are playing chess”  💀
Adam got his moneys worth on that jetskii
“Complains in scouse” 😂😂😂
You need to go to a rainforest and see a tribe that would be sick
Slept on YouTube bro man you should be on  1 milly already
Wow that was expensive
MOST underrated YouTuber out here! Road to a milly this year!
❤️💜
sidemen reacts
I don’t understand how a 7 star hotel that has gold throughout, cant provide an actual Queen sized bed😳 like, is it even worth 7 stars then?
£20 for a drink may seem too much (and obviously it is for us) is nothing for those rich people there.
So underated man your the one with good content
I BEG you all too subscribe if you aren’t !!!!!
Congrats on 600K! Another 400K to go!
that super king size bed really was a catfish
The real question is did they have bidets?
When are you going back to the UK?
This guy is so lucky to be in Dubai especially when in uk we r all in lockdown 😫.Like this comment if ur in lockdown
You made it to 600K Ben! Well done!
I would love to be called assistant for free from the only one Ben Morris.
Keep the great content coming Ben, well done.
Stayed in the World's*
Hi Ben, just thought of an idea while watching ur new video. How about doing a Doing the Top 5 best activities in Dubai? I’ve seen people doing zip-wire etc which could be fun
