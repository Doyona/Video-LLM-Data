one of my favorite games i've ever watched. i come back to watch this multiple times. the celly at the end too inspirational.
Chao said and 1 then called foul after the miss. Dudes so cheap . Zero skill . Just cheats his way to a win.
Why he couldn’t do this on MK 😂😂
ez
This game was brazy Kenny Chao was hitting them shots when he’s on he’s tough to beat & that’s Cam who had a majority of his points in the paint bodying the shorter guard!
Kenny hasn't been the same since 😂
Imagine Getting beat by Kenny chao
Cam plays defense to far back thats why Kenny got so much shots off
How could a young, 6'4 guy who plays everyday, lose to a 5'8 guy who is not really fast, cannot jump, and relies only on stand still 3's off the check and step back 3s. This is an embarrassment.
There's a huge height difference I wonder why he just keep shooting 3's??? Its not even falling for him.. Just post that midget down and get the ball back and it's finish..
Kenny dun got nice with it ✨✨🔥💯. Dope vid guys. Keep it up also Cam
Bro Kenny cannot miss and it looks like cam wasn’t even trying
Cam is the matchup that makes your boys Kenny and Cash work no cap it’s a fun matchup.
How you almost lose to flight but beat cam 🧐
What u screaming and1 for kenny when there's no contact :/
Kenny calling bs fouls
First game he ain’t look trash
No doubt Kenny can hoop when he's not in his feelings. But he a grown ass man fouling the hell out of people but then calls every little thing on him. Dudes a certified hack.
The haters in the comments be the same ones asking for a picture.
Kenny still trash
cam soft as what____?
nah cam real shit for this but kenny still shit
Kenny game getting way better but this man a FOOL with the foul calls while hacking Cam like crazy
They are both trash 🗑
Not a foul
cam how dare you let this lil punk beat you, and why on planet earth did you keep shooting when you have a foot different on old boy? you really played with your food on this one...smh
Kenny would never trash talk someone else like this
He finally won something🤣 dude was 0-3 for 50k😂
kenny was calling some bs
Can anyone explain to me how Cam beat K Showtime in the tourney and K Showtime beat Kenny 💀
Kenny a bitch with all them fouls though
Kenny fell off so bad... :(
Kenny only talks when he’s in the lead. Boy silent when losing 😂 that’s fake confidence right there
This is the Kenny I wanna see 😂😂✊🏿
yeah kenny we all know you'e ass now lmao
What happened to this Kenny, the creators league Kenny is garbage
I like Cams energy he a good guy
Kenny cheating cam out of 3s his foot ain’t even on the line most the time😂
Kenny is still ass. Real talk!
Kenny so soft bruh😭 only time you see him happy is when he winning LMAO
Kenny a bold face lie at 2:02 lmao
Jenny's bump to left hook lay up is fire
That’s not a foul mr chow
cam is so soft
Kenny is weak how do you call that last one a Fell he barely touched him Kenny didn’t when him calling the Fouls won him the game
And this is how kids in the next generation think basketball is supposed to be played😫
I didn’t know ur allowed to take 10 dribbles on average in a 1 on 1 smh this just hurts me eyes
Kenny true trash honestly and EVERYTHING he was calling was bullsh**t!!!!!
Cam’s tall ass stayed chucking 2’s 🤦, why not drive
Cam all jolly and shit in this video
Kenny got chill with the screaming act like you done that shit before screaming like a little girl out there
Cheater, Cam won. Look at Cel's video exposing Kenny.
Kenny shut the fuck up you hit a couple threes and you think you are some body i am surprised you can see the basket with your terrible vision
Kenny try’s to finesse every 1v1 he in with sayin everything a foul he soft asl but ggs to him🤝.
Hoh an L for counting Kenny win on 1st game
Cam shouldn't have been playing with his food shooting 3s. Put Kenny in the post and punish him.
Kenny cries like a baby when he makes that foul face.
20:03 Kenny doubled hahahah
DAMN KENNY
Cam would call a foul if i gave him a high five
That’s sad Kenny playing all these tall hoopers it’s ain’t even fair leg him play some one his height
Cam wilder need to stop because   1. He not James harden  2. He a pussy of going to the rim And 3. He whines like a crybaby just like crswht so basically there partners
Kenny fouls every play and drive
Kenny would only get picked if we needed a 10th guy to run full🤣🤣🤣he's a steady hack and fouled out in the 1st game🤣🤣 utube ball players are hilarious 😂
kenny just hacked and called fouls all game
I knew that kenny chao will win because he's a shooter and shoot similar to stephen  curry and he's a point guard too.
kenny chao really stressin over sum fouls the 5k must mean a lot to him😭😭😭
H o H  we got to quit letting one guy bang the hell out of the offensive player on D then come back on offense and cry about someone playing them tough on D.  if it's gonna be physical let both players b physical.  let's not just call it on one side.
Bet
Kenny looking like a happy lego after he won
talk yo shit Kenny 😂😂
Cam crying too much!
How tall are they
Someone get cam wilder a pair of extra small basketball shorts.
This is how 1v1 should be defensive wise. Not like friga vs mk. Just straight hacks all game. This was mutual respect
cam wilder  trashhhhhh  whos  next Flight?
MK vs Friga trash ass game compare to this game. HOH hire some damn refs cheapass.
Kenny is terrible. He is a hack. He plays like every football player that try’s to play basketball
You can’t say and1 and say it’s a foul mfs be trash
Cam still the better player
Kenny’s beastin’!
Kenny’s nice wtf
Why are u guys shooting so far out. MKs 3pointers we’re at the foul line 😂
Damn, Kenny's really getting better and better
kenny has to go all out but cam is barely sprinting
ian gone lie kenny balled out but he doin too much foe hella loud
Cam u got cheated in that last one Kenny not even like that😂
i dislike kenny a lot
If cams defense was there Kenny would’ve lost
Black community been taking to many Ls lately
Man Cam just got a funny ass personality
Aye Kenny better take boy video off ya page lol
Kenny your still ass
Kenny swear he good dude trash
Kenny is so ass😂😂
Beat cash tho
Kenny look like Kid BOO hahaha 💯🤘🏽

Kenny's game is much improved you can see his hard work paying off great game
All that training with Kakashi Uchiha 🔥🔥🔥🔥 love that shit Kenny
Asian with the braids and the black guy with a fro interesting
I would be both of em 1v1 for 5k
Kenny calling lines for 3s. 😂😂
Cam wilder lowkey is sus, man always be wearing his baby sisters shorts shorts guys gay bro
Best ive ever scene kenny play kenny im glad u learned how to handle the ball at a normal adult level
Nick briz squad vs Kenny chao cam wilder Gio wise and 2 more people they want
At least he firmed it
Kenny switched up 😔
Kenny’s game has improved but that boy be cheating throwing his self into the defender and calling fouls because the defender is in his or her correct spot. He knows it so he throws himself into the defender and cry’s like a bitch. And if I’m not mistaken that’s illegal now.
All you do is foul
Kenny calls so many bad fouls
BAO CHAO
bro this boy was doing the same thing to cam every time but worse and wouldn’t call fouls but every time this boy gets touched he calls fouls
Cam is a fucking crybaby
Kenny Chao calls and 1 when someone contests his body but then hacks in the paint because he’s too small and cries no foul
Huge height difference
Kenny Bao Chaoooo
It's crazy how consistently players go train with Dev and come out better and you can clearly see the before and after improvement.
Someone get marcelous in here so he can show these dudes how to play defense, you kno Kenny gone shoot like 💀
from seeing ken being jessers camera man. to him now being the one of the best basketball ytbers is insane.
still buns
Kenny trash lmaoo he complains bout everything if it don’t go his way no cap
I’m sorry I can’t take Kenny cheating ass serious … he never wanna respect someone call but expects his calls to be respected ??? And then every hooper knows u can’t say AND 1 … miss and then call foul that’s complete bullshit and cam is lame for even giving him that respect … cheaters get no respect
Kenny calling the most bs crap I’ve seen
Kenny fouling as always. Garbage as hell
Cam wilder has height and weight over Kenny, so those fouls he was calling were straight embarrassing
Kenny need to stop fouling
Let's go kenny 😜
Kenny needs to stop calling fouls, he be playing that baby crap
Bro i thought they was playing with a volleyball for a second😂
Bro cam isn’t playing fucking defense
Kenny’s is hot garbage 🗑
Ian gone lie I got hyped to when Kenny said and 1 😂😂😂😂
Kenny!!
Bow Wow
#BAOCHAO
STOP SLEEPING ON KENNY !!!!!!
You suck kenny
On the third game when the score is 2-4 Kenny double dribbles
Bao chao
Kenny playing that Nasty Cash D I mean CashNasty D lol
Goofies
First off ya lost cuz u arguing ya foul calls 🤦🏾‍♂️ if u call foul its a foul Cam u gotta toughen up bro let’s go
And why is Cam so SOFT. Kenny half the size of him and he strugglin in the paint and he aint talkin no shit.
Kenny really thinks he's good 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he's so garbage lmao. Stop trying to give him bullshit encouragement when he really ain't like that. He's a well below average basketball player. He's not even good for a YouTube basketball player. Yall givin this boy fake hype 🤣
Can see how much work he’s put in just from Game 1. Those left hand finishes at the basket were definitely not there a couple months ago. Awesome stuff.
those kenny chao cards be going UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
BAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kenny is a great hooper but he be cheating sometimes no cap but i like what he do
i mean cam is like flight at complete form though so i mean you really is azz

Baby dev @kenny
Cam neck hurt cuz he always bopping his head hard asfuvk
@5:49 no foul
24:32 Calm down lil tay
Cool
I wish Cam would get a deeper bag.
Kennnyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dribble dribble dribble - goes right. Jab step - goes right.
Kenny you improved a lot gs😭💯
6:30 LMFAOO I LOVE THIS NEW KENNY
I will buss Kenny easily 😭😭😭😭
Ngl Kenny fouls every time cam drives😭
4:18 I ain't never seen kenny do this move. That lab work different huh
All the work in the lab paying off‼ Show them ur progress kenny😤😤
Kenny you cant call and one after you make it man...
He still sucks
One reason why kennny might of lost the 2nd game way back was cos was probably worried about his YouTube live streaming to his subscribers, that got probably got him out of focus
Kenny gettin nice
cam at the end lookin like "i just lost to a shit call... shoulda just shot for it.😐"
4:07 Kenny soundin like eren yeager. you already know sum shits boutta go down this match
Kenny chao is the definition of small mans complex. Respect tho cam an overhyped basketball player
GG To Cam Too Both Was Giving And Recieving Bucksts
Big Dub Bro Congrats Man !!!🥶🥶🥶🥶
Kenny is always a baby when he calls fouls
And Kenny complains on all his drive talk about "foul"  cry baby. Just body
Kenny is beating White Iverson in a rematch in my opinion
Bao Chao
Kenny got no defense; he literally shoulder bumps
cam is a str8 cornball
At this point when Kenny heats up I’m just considering it game over
Playing with a white ball is an advantage for Kenny. It looks like a ping pong ball.
Kenny still ass.
BAO CHAO!
Don’t stop here get right back to it keep building on this Kenny!!!!!!
Imagine being bullied on the court by Kenny lmao
Cam ain’t got nothing special in his bag. Bro either shoots or forces his way to the rack. I ain’t never see not one cross over or ankle breaker from him.
kenny has gotten better but defense is apart of the game to he needs to work on his defense against taller players and when your a shorter player you gotta work on your legs and footwork so you can reach the shot a lot faster(like when cam hit that spin jumper at the end of the second game) because a hand in the face dosen't always work but keep grinding and getting better that goes for both players
Price went up !
They both look like they would be garbage in the nba.
Am I the only one who wanted cam to win
4:05 LOOL you improved kenny gg man
Kenny still ass Lmfaoo
Wtf Kenny🤫🔥😳
Wenny
Kenny fouls every defence
Cam been taking Ls lol
YESSIR️KENNY MY DAWG WITH THE DUB
Kenny be finessing so much
Kenny want to be cash so bad lmao but ngl Kenny whooping on cash too!
My mans a whole foot taller and still lost! I’m shleep.
Thumbnail....thought it was a chick vs an Asian guy lol
Cap bro ain no way I seen his last 1v1 and he loses to a tik tok hooper like 11-1 or sumn and can already been skunking him
Dnt like unlimited dribbles... let me just run around and run back to the three. That's all I seen after cam shut down the drive Kenny would run back to three and shoot. Seem like Cam selling to put Kenny over.
Kenny rly iced out the card collector chain lmaoo
#KillerKenny
BAO CHAO! Def earned my respect on this one! Love to see it
Bao Chao
BAO CHAOO!
Cam is the better player but Kenny fr got more heart. Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard
This was a good one ☝️
Kenny finessed the last foul because he called “And 1”. Normally he wouldn’t get that foul
Yes Kenny got better and dominated this game, but I really don’t think cam is that good tbh.
TELL EM KENNY !!!! YASSS
I can’t believe cam picked it up when he said get the rebound ! 😂🤦‍♂️
Cam gets dropped off by players with less skill because he plays way too laid back. Doesn't surprise me. Kenny is still the most inconsistent player on youtube.
I’ve always fw kenny and I’m glad to see him in the lab puttin in work, but his attitude way different then it used to be ngl, gettin a lil cocky kenny
6 minutes in KENNNY IS A HACKKKK
All Kenny does is whine
Smacking someone’s hand on a jump shot is not a foul 😭😭 i wish people stop calling that shit
Cam is clearly better Kenny just plays like a bitch when times get tough
That last possession wasn’t a foul. He said and 1 clear as day. This game felt rigged against Kam because of the difference of height
Cam high key overrated lmao goddamn
Kenny soft as shit
Y’all should’ve done 7 all 1s so nigga can’t just only shoot 3s to save him
kenny need new moves hes done that snatch back hezi into lay up and its getting him no where
that game winning shot was so clutch 😅
Them training sessions w dev paying off kenny finishing at the rim and has a lil more wiggle now I love it, I’d still drop his ass off😘
My reaction to this game. I'm absolutely SHOCKED Cam lost. https://youtu.be/tS0T_C-ViFs
I NEED CASH TO REACT ASAP SO I CAN WATCH
Nah kenny is a hack😭😭😭😭
Kenny is funny man haha good game fellas.
Kenny fouling like crazy
No way, Kenny got in his head 💀💀
Cam gotta work on his defense bro
Kenny didn’t even really win cuz cam in the first game he won tbh they was not one point they was 2 but it alright
Cam is too nice man lol he lets Kenny and whoever he plays get every call! 🤦🏽‍♂️ then when they make a call on him he never debates it lol don’t let these boys take advantage of your kindness bro! Haha good games fellas!
Cam is sooooo over rated
BAO CHAO! Kenny be smoking layups on purpose his last few videos to not show his real game. He showed it to Cam today.
Kenny is acting like he beat some Great basketball player. Cam cares more about his weirdo hair than basketball... And Kenny your defensive stance in the worst I'm ever seen....
4:20 Kenny shifted that boy cam & put him on the clippp
Yeah kenny been workin but his attitude towards the game is still annoying as hell.
Cam your the worst 6ft basketball player ever bro
Ou gear 🧐🧐🧐🧐
Idk if Kenny got Better or cam got worse
Same ol Cam Wilder getting bullied because he doesn’t do well with confrontation. Everyone knows if you call AND1 & miss it’s not a foul. Kenny got ball back on game point LMAO (plus he created the contact in the first place, no ref would call that). Kenny is a student. He listened to EVERYTHING Dev taught him & it shows. Got his weight up, stand on your 10 toes in any confrontation, dribble moves. Everything. Even down to his character, talking back confidently like Hezi. Plus dude has high arcing 3s from being short so way higher chance it goes in. These guys born with natural talent never get it, few do. Imagine if Cam actually studied, trained & applied. You know it’s bad when Kenny calling you a tik toker when you’re supposed to be the baller😂😂 GG. Get in the damn lab!!! Kenny exposing people💯
How you let sho shang chin beat you 😱😭
Cam is garbage for this L
Kenny finesses to win games😭😭😭that’s crazy dawg that’s crazy dawg that’s crazy dawg.
Kenny in the gym everyday but still somehow the worst basketball player out of the whole basketball group 😭😭
Kenny got that hall of fame complainer badge equipped forsure
You guys are trash if you think Kenny is good. He's horrible.
Yes sir Kenny you’ll be short for the rest of your life 😤💪🏽🍚
Kenny was fouling then crying be like friga he let his game talk doesn’t need to argue every foul when it’s clear
We need a ref lmao😂
Can’t call and1 and call foul same time in a pick up…unspoken rule
Bao chao!!!!! Kenny that sniper 🔥🔥
lol Kenny crying like a baby all game bro so annoying luck was on his side Cam is better end of disc.
Where’s cel 😂😂
KENNY KENNY CHAO CHAO !!! BEEN WORKING HARD!
Gg but Kenny acting like a 🐱
To be 6’4 das some weak ass defense. Of course he’s gonna shoot your hands are down 🤦🏽‍♂️
BAO CHAO🏆
Cam too worried about his shorts staying short, he keeps rolling them up 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kenny talking spicy 🌶 “ cash I like this Kenny “ ! 🤣
Cam really sucks
Softest 7 footer I’ve ever seen!! 😂
You're bouth are funny⛹‍♂️
Bro these 3s and this quickness is insane
yesssirrr kenny
Why Dey played to 8 tho last game this ont take away from his game wit tk tho 😂
Kenny did wha he did on mk
What a shame Cam...
Kenny so serious haha
Kenny cheated that last game, if you call and one you cant call foul. Great games tho
Me patiently waiting for cash and cel to react
Not kshowtime😂😂
Bao Chao!
Kenny needs to stay humble he be trying to act more and more tough every video
Kenny vs cel rematch 👀👀
Kenny def improved but he finessed his way to this dub
Can cam not dunk
The piano beat at the end goes hard, what is it? Also gg Kenny was rooting for the underdog, Cam nice but mentally he weak af needs to work on that
I’m proud of Kenny, he came a long way🤧🙏🏿. Buuut he was hacking and fouling all game💯then when it came to Cam, he didn’t let none of Cam’s fouls be valid fr😐 the height difference shouldn’t matter, it’s all about skill and practice. Plus Kenny was pretty much whining the whole time but good game I guess🤷🏾‍♂️
kenny bro i knew you had it in you good job homie
Yooooo Kenny u always tryin to cheat someone out bro u know he shot a 2 instead of a 1 his foot was behind the line smh come on Kenny
Bro Kenny has ZERO stamina
how the hell does this boy lose to carlos freking win against cam mad respect tho
Waiting on cel to react 😂
Softy 😂
It’s not that Kenny’s bad it’s that he’s just inconsistent asl
Kenny either automatic or dog shit. He throws up prayers 🤣
Fire games, shout out to both guys
Our game is broken today. Someone like Cam shoots perimeter shots against someone half his size..that was painful.
Finally Kenny finished a layup
Kenny still can’t beat more cel😭😭😭😭😆
YESSIR Kenny finally I see some actually good moves and good shots. Let’s goo you deserve this BAO CHAO
Hell naww he called and1 and still got ball back
When Kenny beats Cash he has my respect💯
What are we gonna say now...? Everyone beats Cam these days. Just sayin, sorry Cam. His D is weak and his O is streaky. I'd beat you both. Definitely not beating me with 3s. I'm 5'7 and I have 5k. What's up?
Cam ass on defense Ong
Kenny I wanna play YOU !
Cam you’re waste of being tall use you’re size 🤦🏾‍♂️
BOA CHAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The whole chat was toxic asf to Kenny tho
I had Kenny winning this and bao the man did his thang with the W💯    Cam you did your thang too💯   Good games guys💯
That boy cam gotta get in the lab with dev
YEA KENNY
Kenny’s trash talk is sooo cringe
Kenny off a 30 fasho
I onced refered him as Jesser's cameraman but now I refer him as Cam's father
Kenny this is very impressive u have improved a lot I've never seen u this good and I watch all the vids training with dev is paying off
6'5" cam called k showtime baby food just cuz he 5'11" then lost to him, bro kenny is like shorter than 5'8"  o.o
Kenny wants to be black so bad 💀
Bao chao!!!!!
Now just play consistent like that and we won’t talk sht no more lmao
I'm a fan of kenny but it's so hard to root for him, cheating any chance he gets, fouls every drive on defense. Especially when he's playing a guy like cam who is so humble.
Congrats to Kenny a well deserved win he put in the WORK and it SHOWS now let’s congratulate the un sung HEROS of this Bao Chao win Big Big Big congrats to the reaction goat CashNasty for putting Kenny in the gym this is how he was able to absorb contact and still shoot and lay up the ball Last but definitely not least Dev THEE GOAT of YouTube basketball and hell drop off most of ur favorite NBA players but he has given Kenny the skill to pull off this win an he so fucking humble he dont care about the praise but imma do it anyway momma always said i was hard headed look at the change Kenny made in a short time at the lab he looking super dangerous which he is his failures are mostly in his brain dev know what i mean but congrats kenny u did fucking amazing and i was entertained the entire time kudos
WENNNYYYY
YESSAHHHHH
Damn cam should really play defense he just gave Kenny free open shots 😐 other than that this game wasn’t as entertaining
Good shit Kenny!!!

20:09 Literally seen Kenny practice this in 2 of his Training videos with Dev. Good shit Kenny
Kenny starting to go now… nice..💪🏾🤙🏽
My respect for cam wilder 📉📉📉📉, Kenny is terrible
Damn kenny look clean
There’s a line between competitive trash talk and disrespect bro wouldn’t have made it home where I’m from
I swear kenny stays showing out when its a crazy anticipated game 😭😭😭
Kenny is good but cheats every 1v1
Marcel and Kenny gotta run it back
HE LIKE THAT, THE MAN STRIVE UNDER PRESSURE BAO CHAO 💪
cam is such a bitch lol. why yall hype this clown
So even though Cam argued with Kenny. He ended up respecting all of his calls. Kenny however argued and didnt respect a lot of cams calls. That ain’t fair. AND, kenny was calling DUMB shit
Kenny played good but why did he have to be so cringe
Need better audio
Kenny the only guy i know who can foul someone the whole possession. And then question the call. But he call the foul every single posession
Cam you let me down my boy smh...
Kenny looks like kid buu out there
If cam kept on driving he would have won
WOW. True. Authentic. GROWTH. - Thank you Kenny.
You better shout out dev next time for putting you on fr fr
Bow chow🔫
I wanna see xrm n chao

big W kenny
Dam crazy
They both play like somebody bitches
LETS FUCKING GO KENNY
KENNY BEEN IN THE LAB❗️❗️❗️
I want to go to dev lab now😂
This man dev the illest trainer out come on bro
I hate Kenny and how he plays so much
Kenny a Killer. His game reminds me of IT in his prime from the Boston Celtics. Shot put can create specs off the dribble to get off his shot over taller defenders. Can finish at the rim with a tough lay, although his finishing ability is iffy at times it's definitely gotten better. It's his ball-handling and shooting ability that's dangerous. He's legit and he's only getting better. If you underestimate him you'll end up losing.
oooohh shit marcelas gotta be thinking bout running it back about now
get den kenny
Cam Wilder…if you see this you deserved to lose this game.
I think kenny is ready for a rematch with cel, will he win i dont think so yet but it should be interesting
Yall need to do PED test on Kenny ASAP. He s too agreesive, too strong. 😂😂
Kenny is like that don’t play with my boiii 🤟🔥👌👌
Kenny weak as hell most annoying YouTuber I have ever watch omm
Kenny be cheating with them calls🤣🤣🤣
If Kenny doesn't own anybody. He owns cam. Lol
BAO CHAOOOOOO
Good shit Kenny.
Bro that last drive wasn’t a foul.
Bro Kenny so toxic
Next time can we get a shot clock for Kenny that man drives in and then comes out to the 3 point line and does it over and over
BAO CHAO!! LETS GO KENNY!!!
Just saw linsanity vs kellyobre
Still hasn fix that issue wit his leg when he layup lmao
Kenny be hacking then calls foul when cam breathes on em good win tho he deserves it best of luck to both of them
I need cash reaction
Wtfff
Cameraman back up to where we can see there feet at the 3 point line
Kenny still is dodo buns cause he so exited this fa sho his first win in a long time and he’s so cocky sometimes
Kenny low key finessed cam in game 3 he called and 1 missed them called foul👀
Kenny Cheater chao yet again
Kenny so proud he won over weak ass calls. Cam deserves for clout.
As always. Kenny cheats. Every chance he gets. Cam called foul and Kenny made him shoot for it. Then Kenny calls And 1 which ain’t a foul and then doesn’t shoot for it. Cam a good honest player. Kenny tried to cheat people every time he plays.difference between a real hooper and some dish that don’t live an honest life.
Not a kenny 1v1 without this 16:08 😭
Cam has NO dog in him at all lol he be getting buss up in all these big matchups
I ain’t seen Cam win in a minute
Why do I feel like cam plays at the level of competition and then lose and blame himself cause he let down
BAOCHAO
LETS FUCKIGN GO KENNY
22:25 bruhhhhh kenny is such a cheater it annoys me cam hit his guide hand after he took the shot where's the foul
Cash gone love this video
OKAYYY KENNNYYY!!♥️
W
Cam wilder can hoop but that man baby shit soft
This 5k kenny making is more than he made all year off his videos that average under 10k views lmfao without 2hype he is nothing
kenny so cringe
And cams got no defence lol
Kenny is the shoes that made you play like that.. good shit bro..
Kenny is so ass🤣🤣🤣
26:13 was clearly a double dribble. Somebody come get this dude.
No lie , Cam is muh better than Kenny, Everyone can have good and bad days, if one of them is hot its over but consistency wise if i had to bet if they played each other 10 time, Came is winning 6 of them at least. Good shit tho Kenny you wasnt missing
BAO CHAO 💯
22:35 Kenny he did not even touch you at all, but even if he did, thats a bitch foul, Everyone knows hand is part of the ball, calling foul if he hit your hand after your shot or even while your shooting is lame asf
you could tell who was actually gonna win because Kenny was practicing game moves during warmups and Cam was j shooting around
Wow. He played out his ass. Props
Surprise Kenny won now he gonna throw it in his face
You’ve come a long way Kenny. We all see it, just keep working
Kenny lookin super tuff
Cam threw the last game heavy. He was settling for jumpers when they weren't falling. Once I seen that I knew the game was over.
Shout out to Dev he really put the Bao in Bao Chao!!!!
Massive respect for Kenny heart over height been in the lab paid off paying those bills 🔥🔥
Cam made almost every shot that he went in the paint but he kept shooting 3s
Mr “in the lab Kenny” at work
Yeeeeeeeesirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr kenny fuck all the doubters let's go kenny give my boi respect bao chao
Aye bruh tbh ion think cam all that tbh
Kenny’s a hack. If Cam polished up his game and matched Kenny’s energy, it’d be over with. Good runs tho Kenny you’ve definitely improved
It was not a foul Kenny trash
Cam is terrible
Cam did not use his height Advantage Enough in the paint
Kenny is a world class cheater
BOW CHAO!
Finally putting Dev’s moves into play
BOW CHAO
Kenny fouls so much
Kenny is so annoying, i don’t think he got fouled one time the whole vid
Choa season
I ain’t gone hold you, Kenny showed he been working hard on his game. He earned that dub.
Kenny looking real shifty, I like it!
@26:19 that's from the lab
Kenny acting different, can’t wait for cash and marcelas to react to this
BOW CHAO!!
cant wait for cash's reaction
Respect for both players! Someday you win and someday you lose. GGs indeed.
He cheat cam 2 threes
When the bullied gets the chance to be a bully
This the Kenny that beat White Iverson and MK
Kenny was locked in. Kenny is playing like 5K is on the line and cam is playing like he already won. Great win for Kenny he earned this. Hours in the lab really do pay off 💰
Good shit Kenny!
zone 6 lookin so sad rn
Kenny shot is deadly good misses too he got that shift now all he needs is a spin whenever he pulls it behind his back
ngl them calls were a little bullshit, but LFG BAOCHAO
let this be a lesson to kids.GET IN THE LAB AND WORK ON YOUR GAME YOU WILL GET BETTER, THAT WILL GROW YOUR CONFIDENCE AS WELL. KEEP YOUR CONFIDENCE MAN BUTTTT AS YOU TRAIN YOULL BE MORE CONFIDENT! GOOD SHIT KENNY NOW GROW FROM THIS WIN MAN
Considering how bad Kenny did the last game, I'm proud
Is Kenny the best hopper on YouTube.. only cash nasty beat him
Cam 🌎
How tall is Kenny?
Alright now all kenny gotta do is beat cash and his basketball career is complete 😂
Cam is a tall dude with a ok jumper he not like that im starting to see

Kenny record is 3-165 but this was his biggest dub 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit rigged
Get in the weight room cam should be able to beat kenny easily playing Bully ball at your size, take notes from sensei Nasty. Bao Chao!! Boi
BOW CHAO
Kenny the goat 🐐🐐🐐
Cam plays soo light skin 🤦🏿‍♂️ he could sweep Kenny if he was just a little bit aggressive
Cam wtf 🤦‍♂️😭
Wow. Progression!!! Kenny with the W. Played well 👏 👌 good work 👏
yeah kennyyy!
Kenny really used those unlimited dribbles lol
Kenny your HACKING and then saying it’s not a hack wtf . Can’t respect it
Shout out to Dev in the lab out here shaping demons
Can nd his crew talented but they ain’t got that dog in them
why is cam even popular he aint even good
Faithfully waiting for Cash to react…
Just by watching warm ups you can tell who is gonna win. Kenny is working on game shots while cam is goofing off and moving slow
Waiting for cel to react

Kenny is ass Cam just worse😭😭
This had to be fixed cam literally beat Kenny 21-2 without breaking a sweat
IN THE LAB !
mans is a 6'5 NAIA hooper and lost
This was intense!
Cam need to learn how to stand his ground. Kenny said a1 which isn’t a foul call then wait mad long and called foul…… not how things works but good shit from Kenny that boy looking nice
Kenny came to prove these haters wrong 🤣
I ain’t seen this nigga cam play good since he was on friga team vs nick briz the one and only time🤦🏾‍♂️he ass let’s face it💯
Cams Shit Still
Put some respect on his name KENNY IS OFFICIALLY LIKE THAT!!
cam  use yo motha fuckin strength when you go to the rack
Kenny I need some Bao Chao shorts
@9:55 layup package improving
Kenny’s game has improved so much, Cam and him were calling some iffy fouls, but Kenny didn’t finess near as much this game as he usually does.
This the biggest win of Kenny career rn he know it cam been taking Ls to end the year but I think 2022 will be a good year for cam
Cam ass bro when y’all go see it
Cam could really play but tries to be be pretty Kenny has more nigga in him😭😭
Uh oh
BAO CHAO
Kenny’s LaMelo Ball chain gave him special powers
Kenny be finessing last call wasn’t a foul lmao, but cam did sell losing game 1
Kenny has been working, I would’ve bet it.
Bro spam up cash and cel bro they would be proud! Yes sir Kenny!!😎 you’ve come a long way bro
Talk yo shit Kenny spam dat shit up 💪🏿
I love Kenny bro, but as usual he cheated. He didn’t respect Cams foul calls, then told Cam he had to respect his, smh Kenny
Lol
I feel like cam doesn't play his hardest sometimes..is it just me? He shows a different level of talent in different videos and tries harder sometimes. He just plays around sometimes to be honest.
How is Cam such a loser😭😭
Cam should’ve used his size more. Trying to pull too many 3s. Could’ve got whatever he wanted in the paint
i said kenny gonna win
Kenny bro u put in that fkn work 🔥 Can tell you’ve been training 💪🏾
LETS GOO KENNY!!!

Kenny completely explodes on Cam for calling completely legitimate fouls cause he can’t defend him and even makes him shoot for one, then complains and whines until he gets his foul call which were iffy af some were ok but that last one was BS but ig whoever throws the biggest fit comes out on top 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

Cam seems like a good dude, but on the court he’s sorry as fuck sometimes 😅
Kenny rlly leveled up hanging with dev for the training and with the hoolies for the mentality.

Anyone think Kenny knows that “boy” was a term given to black people with the purpose of being demeaning and basically saying that blacks will always be inferior to everyone else.. cuz he was spamming that word towards cam recklessly 😂😂😭
