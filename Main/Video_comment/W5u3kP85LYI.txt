Love the green/blue stripe outfit

This is amazing and also love the RHPS reference
This song is so Halloween coded
MARINA PLSSS THE GIRLS WANT PTP ON TOUR 😭😭😭 RECONSIDER QUEEN I BEG
Ye , fudge u Lana del Rey
I love the songs from this album..MARINA IS LIFE!!
she was so ahead of her time, wow motherina
It's a great day to watch this video. Cheers, MARINA. I hope you meet my sister Grace Kelly someday.
Ngl Marina is kinda attractive (don’t get wrong thoughts I ment like tiny crush ) but she is SO pretty
❤
this is so froot coded
IM OBSESSED
The ruby slippers, the treading water, Rocky Horror vibes & the idea of Mother Nature singing a song like this??? 1:36 onwards is still so hard hitting
Sydney Sweeney has great genes.  "On guys? Straight leg" 🏳️‍🌈okay.  I fucking need this song right now.
This might be the best song I've listened to in a while
Normally I listen to death metal, but this is pretty lit
I've been listening to Marina since 2012, and I can say for sure that this is her best lyric, it's a shame that it doesn't get as much recognition.
Cause i. Dont wanna live if i cant bs honest gurl u ate that ily sm. Omg pls be my mother i need a princess
Love this song since it came out and so relevant now
Ok, I have too many songs by Marina that I love but this song has the best beat and I love it so much I’ll listen to it on repeat
sigo regresando por aqui , mi album favorito ♥
These comments are unbearable 😂
❤
That was crazy back in 2021❤
I like that shes singing as the feminine devine and mother nature, mother earth.
Turkey loves you sooooo much.
Since this song is about social commentary I think it’s perfect for GTA 6 since the game series is also about Capitalism just like Niko Bellic from GTA 4 said “Capitalism is a dirty business”
Some songs have weak lyricism, but this one has a decent one :)
Mate,Ive always loved this chicks awesome musik,!😁😎🤘🙏
love her!
i love her outfits
hi
Marina is on top of my pedestal for artists who embody the earth, shes besides aurora lol i love her music.
2025 😂 anyone ?
Her music is just so real. I love the messages she sends and she's clearly having so much fun. Her new one "CUNTISSIMO" is my fave
Good on Trump for fighting for womens rights. MAGA! 🎉
This song hits harder in 2025
I'm with the feminist witches
i’m so serious when i say this is one of the best songs/music videos i’ve ever heard/watched
NEED TO PURGE THE POISEN!💚🖤
She pushed a little bit too much with this one
Girl we know about america, talk about how shitty is you're oun country and i'm not even form U.S.A
It should have at least 500M views, people are sleeping
Love love love her and the song but wish (my personal opinion, I'm allowed) it was a little more family friendly because my son is a big fan and I just don't feel comfortable having him listen. Bummer but I know she's allowed to have her creative freedom. One of my favorites.
HINOOOOO
Marina's style is just iconic, no matter the album or song!!!!
❤❤❤
Марина я из украины голос нежный
NEED TO PURGE THE POISON FROM MY SYSTEM UNTIL HUMAN BEINGS LISTEN, TELL ME, WHO YOU THINK YOU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREEEEEEEEEEE
This MAY be my favourite song ever
2025
I notice the Sparks influence, and never turn your back on mother earth !
Crazy how she literally TOLD US and yall ignored her
America has usually just response to aggression.
2025!!
Beautiful ❤
America is never going to be good.
🌹
Jaw dropping, literally, Marina you are so gorgeous. My jaw remained Dropped the entire music video.  I feel like this is a response to Primadonna - moving from external validation to internal knowing. Idk I recently began listening to Primadonna this week again (used to be OBSESSED with the song and felt very connected lol) and it was fun to Step Back into my mindset back then. "oh no!" Feels connected too, like a return to the "I know exactly who I am and who I'm gonna be" - returning to that confidence in self rather seeking external validation through romantic relationships like we feel in Primadonna  Idk I'm so happy to hear this song ❤❤❤ happy to reunite with Marina
SOOOO we all starting a coven after Marina admitted she's a witch? 🙇‍♀️
Ruined by that stupid vox in the chorus.. After the last couple of albums it’s hard to remember way back to the exciting genius that sprung from every track of the first three albums.  Marinas Muse is a long forgotten thing,and that’s SO sad.
I love this bro
This is what I’m talking about Ma, not only being a legend but making a whole lesson of how to!
Marina has her style, she aint no basic mainstream artist
I remember watching this before it had 100K views, oof. Great song, don't think i'll ever get sick of listening to it 🙏
Probably one of my favorite songs of all time
1:28 Good call, damn
Marina's dropping a new album, time to get back into my Marina phase craze!! 🎉🎉
This is truly an amazing song.. its getting so many important things across
simplesmente amo purge the poison 🙏🏻
My exgf introduced marina to me lol jokes on her 😂 i get to listen to dope artists without arguing everyday.
Why am I so absurdly late to seeing this video...!!!!!
I posted this on Twitter a few months ago.
SAVAGES PART TWO
yall weren’t listening and now it’s too late for america..
Vibe is = how can she come from greece and be above regular people comprehension?
This song is like a curse and i think the chorus could be used as a banishment
R.I.P Los Angeles 🥴 Mother nature on the phone What have you been doing? Don’t forget, I am your home Virus come, fires burn Until human beings learn From every disaster You are not my master….  Tell me, who do you think you are, are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far
‘Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn’  We never learn
wandavision vibes help??
Idk how u can hate her
It’s my birthday first song of my 25th imma grown ass man 😤✨✨
The production is amazing! Really good song!
She is literally the most underrated artist. She serve and she's an icon.
0:55
best pop song ever i will die on this hill
Marina and Lana are my guilty pleasures that if my friends will find out about them they will think i am homosexual
❤
Damn. Apparently I’m so obsessed with the recent Wicked movie. I actually thought this song had references sprinkled in, and was inspired by the play. All from the Pink and Green to the red sparkle shoes! 😅
bless Marina forever. a true star.
Marina is so good that she's one of only three artists in my YT labyrinth who have their own playlist.
Harvey ((Weinstein)) gone to hell ✡️
❤
The Pop Witch ❤
2:17
IDK WHY I HADNT SEEN THIS EARLIERRRR!! MARINAAAA ILY!! I love the way she says “tell me who’d you think you aaAAreee!”
I love the fact she’s really just making note of societies faults especially America
Here after the 2024 election. Marina knows how to articulate exactly how I feel in this system. This album is my mantra for the next couple of days. ❤️🌎
Listen to her WORDS "britney shaved her head and all  we did was called her crazy" preach to marina for calling out the ppl who called her crazy as if it was normal
Thank you you have had been a part of my crucial transformative powerr
I LOVE HER SO MUCH
What does her sequin see throu dress says on her chest? I mean i cant catch a single moment to read it. ❤❤
I love her sm
This song has a perfect halloween vibe!
Natalia Oreiro 😅
THIS IS MY JAM!!!
Words to remember: "Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor".  At least it made 99% of us poor, the rest are doing fine, much better than ever.
Wow - this is her best song
Marina i love you and this Album but a lot of it feels like performativ actevism
I love a Brit telling me I need forgiveness for every single war. Every one, huh?
I keep thing she is talking about Covid and when everyone was saying Covid was the earth being mad at us (everyone I’ve said it to has said they don’t think so)
2:31 idk but its giving nevermore ( the webtoon)
Does this lady have a bad Song? Absolutely all the ones I've heard are really good.
The lyrics are absolute bs/garbage but the music is decent
Can’t believe she invented earth and the 80s 🔥 ❤
She is so beautiful and so strong I want to play a honest game of billiards 😂
"mother nature on the phone, what have you been doing?"
'god forgive america for every single war' - I'm hoping she's being sarcastic, but these days it's hard to tell.
This song sounds great but alas how badly has this video aged… this woke parody! Its a bit cringey and the masks give me pts.
❤❤❤
Te amo marina
Her vocals omg
Marina my hero❤
came here because i heard a man saying all women are dumb and should have their rights taken away LOL ily marina my queen🥰🥰
My HERO
I love u
MARINA MOTHER NATURE
❤
mother MARINA 💕
@ 2:19 the background synths sounds cute, almost kiddish, innocent, welcoming, giddy, THEN a few seconds later it comes out wih such bombastic force! it's genius! gets you off guard! like BAM!, it's beautiful!!!!
Heels on the pool??, that is SO ICONIC
Marina baby no
Amoooo ❤
I love all the features the heels look so gorgeous! ❤❤❤❤
Marina, be my wife, I'll take care of you...
Marry me
The fact that this song doesn’t have even 1 GRAMMY crime.
❤
❤
❤
❤❤❤

"God forgive America for every single war!"  - Marina Diamandis is a Greek Goddess.
My family wondering why i listen to Marina.....(..)...not too hard zo guess it..😢
Woman would ruin the world if they had power. They shouldn't have it, because I care about humanity more than "fairness".
Queen. She reminds to a certain extent - her powerful artist expression- to Queen/ Freddie Mercury. Awesome!
such a great, very cool, and the lyrics, her voice and sexiness is awesome!!!!
❤❤🌕🌕😻😻
1:58 written in her dress was ACTION
1:22
Pure art, pure beauty... Marina is so fucking special ❤️
❤
awesome Dress!
Marina 2015: Do really want me to write a feminist anthem? I’m happy cooking dinner in the kitchen with my husband Marina 2021:
Tbh she ate
Are those gloves a dr seuss reference
Purge my neices from your indoctrination
i love this woman. her music is so good, her voice is beautiful, she's aware of what goes on in the world. love marina forever ❤❤
Basically America attacked Syria, Afganhistan,Yemen,Libya,Somalia,Iraq,Iran so that’s why she said “god forgive America for every single war”
#FREEBRITNEY
I remember disliking this song because the lyrics were so unsubtle. I dont feel that way anymore lol.
where is the new ritual for the orphans?
I just hope she is not on the team if the globalist and communist the pieces  of trash who create every problem on earth then come in to “ save us “ . If she’s outside of that then I’m on her team. I can’t tell where she’s coming from
Boomers in the USA had the greatest turn away from God and belief, Boomers are kind of running the world right so let's see how this goes.... Been interesting so far.
❤
I was in love with marina 15 years ago and I am still now. XD.
AAA QUEEN💚
This is the only queen who I will bend on my knees for. ❤
I love Marina and this is a good song but the line when she says God forgive America for every single war is a very broad generalization that she normally doesn't make and I was surprised to hear it's like Pearl harbor never happened or something. God forgive America for it's many wars would be a better line.
I love how transparent you are!
The Ruby Slippers are a really heavy icon here. Judy was the OG abused showdog.
🌶️
Ever since it came out it became one of my favorite rock songs in my playlist <3
Authentic
you are such a beautiful woman. colour me in love
Saw the dawn was comin', everybody knew... change coming everyone can feel it.
This song is from the hear tof our generation change is coming... Earth is like a white rose, quiet cloud of petals cold A place so corrupt where angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new, studded with a diamond dew Saw the dawn was comin', everybody knew
❤️‍🩹
but your home is now your prison
Love her.
She has the fairest complexion.
She is the queen of militancy!!! ❤
Look, the song SLAPS. But can we talk about how cute Marina is? Like i know that's not the point of the song but this woman is adorable
Love you Marina!!
Awesome.
Why can't I stop listening to this song? why? is it because she and her friends are witches?
I've been on a Marina kick lately and this is just forever relevant... Happy New Year, everyone. Maybe we'll learn this year. 🤔
Marina is the queen of global anthems 😍😍😍😍😍
💝
marina aka mother nature
love this song!!!
mezmerizing!
This is "we didnt start the fire'" for millennials and Gen Z
This song is perfect ❤❤
2:15  This whole verse is the most poetic shit I've ever heard in a pop song
She shouldn’t get political cause she doesn’t know anything. Capitalism is the reason she has what she has
This is disgusting cringe. I'm embarrassed for her
I can’t believe I’ve only come across Marina just this month. An instant favorite! I’ve had this on repeat lately taking an occasional break to listen to the rest of her discography. 💖💖💖
200k likes ❤
Marina is the only singer who can make lyrics so delusional it should be really cringe to listen to, but kills it so much with the actual voice that I can listen to it anyway. That's talent.
LOVE
Am I the only one who feels like this is kind of like a modern take on We Didn't Start The Fire?
Beatstar players who played this awesome chart
All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master" Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are?

It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are?

🌟
Capitalism made us poor. Derailed the whole song for me😔
very cool.
This song is so underrated!!! Amazing❤
This is what a clueless feminist incel looks like
Love the video.. love the song.. the “wuo oh” ❤❤❤
She danced in the red shoes
Welcome to Beatstarrrr, QUEEN ❤️🔥🔥🔥
Your in beatstar now!
o único erro dessa música é falar América ao invés de Estados Unidos mesmoKKKK
Absolute queen and icon 👑
I was listening to "Dancing with Tears in my eyes" and it reminded me of this song. Both song are great and espesacially Marinas meaning.
New world order...😢
Marina my queen forever, I can't explain how I love this song 💜
Got a 20 second unskipable add before this and sat through it purely because this song slaps hard enough to make it worth it
MY HOLY SONG
This is the song they should've used for the Barbie movie
shes so smart
We hear you.
0:14
sorry, is she in the pool with socks
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
One ancient woman 👩  In Melbourne Victoria Australia 🇦🇺 STRAYA SOUTHERN Cross ➕ Southern HEMISPHERE   Did here YOU 🙇
This is my favorite song foreverrrr
... Marina  a évolué, mais garde une plastique très sympathique ... ^^  ... Elle me rappelle un peu PJ Harvey par certains aspects ...  ... Elle cite souvent Hollywood dans ses textes ...
I just noticed she has space buns like the candy bar girl from The Purge movie
🌟
Wow Marina even invented Witches!
SLAYYYYYYYY
Correction : socialism made us poor Addition : desperate, immured and silenced
We need to purge the system of feminism
Arthas to Stratholme be like :
This is the most punk I’ve ever heard a pop artist sounds like
She reminds of myself lol 😂
I freaking love her music 🎉😂❤
Love her🤩
Marina is sooo breathtaking.  She makes my heart race at 100 miles an hour! 😻😻😻
❤❤
Marina is one of the greatest artists I've ever seen. Her songs have meanings I can't explain. I don't know if it is on my mind but this song is so conected to "Savages". Both songs make me feel so good.
OMG Marina defending Britney.
Awesomeness 💋   @cher @global Madonna @gary Barlow  GOLDEN ✈ 🐦 ➕ 🦇 LIFT OFF 🎺 37
she always spits facts
she's stolen my heart goddd
Marina is the example of artist that should be heard by everyone. Her songs are meaningful and essential.
I always knew Hollywood is full of Witches. It's so awesome. Finally.
capitalism made us poor ?
Mother is mothering
My favourite❤
marina is so cool
I always love her songs
I LOVE IT
Still amazing. Still her best.
marina dissing america is a pearl
Cant believe marina created the earth 😮😮😮
I mean this in a positive way when I say this is like the modern we didn't start the fire
I love that the video is so simple, just visual effects and lots of creativity, almost zero waste!
<3
I'm a hungry planet I had a youthful face They were in a hurry To go to outer space They needed bombs and tungsten Ore and iron too So they climbed and they dug and they blew  Divided me right in two I'm a hungry planet Orbiting in the sky The things they did to hurt me Pass on by and by Now here I am all alone They never, ever learn Why I had to shake and quake And make their houses burn I'm a hungry planet I had the bluest seas Oh, the people kept choppin' down All my finest trees Poisonin' my oxygen Diggin' in my skin Takin' more out of my good earth Than they'll ever put back in I'm a hungry planet...  HUNGRY PLANET  © 1970 Skip Battin, Kim Fowley, and Roger McGuinn
1:51 I love that she looks just like Amy Winehouse
Happy birthday purge the poison!!
2 years today
2 anos de "Purge The Poison". Que venham as próximas! ❤
Rezo todos los días para que saques más canciones mi alma las necesita ❤❤❤
Mother nature is currently purging ♥️😌 thank you mother nature and for this beautiful song about her.

Utterly transcendent.
Love this song, really reminds me of an 80s classic, Cathouse by Danielle Dax.
shes a witch and I love witchies
🦚🦚🦚
She is so talented💗🛐
"You forgot without me you won't go far" She's most likely portraying women and/or Mother Nature.  Edit: Maybe she's talking about herself because she is the only thing keeping us from falling off the edge
this is so cheesy
I love Marina
Escuchar esta canción en vivo, no tiene precio ❤
The west has been feminised enough, now try the middle east.
When the end of the world happens I want to die with this song in the background
honestly im scared she will also disappear as an "accident" araanged by the goverment lmao
Why are those clapping red gloves the canvas for Froot on spotify?

She's such a queen, it's like Mother Earth taking lol Not punishing but damning none the less cuz we all killed The earth, no one is innocent yet a small rich few are the most to blame
NEED TO PURGE THE POISON FROM OUR SYSTEM UNTIL HUMAN BEINGS LISTEN TELL WHO DO YOU THINK YOU AREEEE
Marinas awake or is she 🤔you wouldn't mention new world order and purge the poison in the same song if you weren't. Hmmm......
She needs to be more popular.. that way maybe the world will take some fucking notice about how fucked up it is.
This is a Masterpiece 💀🌊
تحصيلي٢ او٣؟
I love ❤️ this song.
I hate the word “iconic” but I lack of better words
the most accurate music video ive seen that looks exactly how the song feels

I’m lowkey convinced that Marina is Mother Nature trying to warm us about our issues.  This is one of my favorite eras.
Do NOT miss the most important line: "CAPITALISM MADE US POOR"!!
Oh my.. this is amazing song
stan marina👊👊
I remember I found Marina on some transgirls FB feed... And then started to research her... Purge the Poison was her single at the time... And it grew on me... Then Ancient Dreams popped up on my Spotify as a new release... And I got excited.... Listening to that album transformed me for a while... During that time life was sunny... I took long walks in town listening through the album... And I was having glorious visions... It was a beautiful time... I was in sync with my inner Goddess.... But then my landlord raised my rent and it destroyed the visions....
Is AMAZING MARINA SUPREME!
my third comment for this song :))) i love you marina ♡♡♡ from the bottom of my heart
Yeah cuz Hollywood feminists are gonna save us...
R/witchesvspatriarchy
This photographer definitely doesn't love you.
😂😂
Will feminists ever not be cringe? Adults unironically believing in witchcraft is cringe. Women are the biggest factor behind the destruction of the planet, most aggressively breeding biological children as a requirement for the exchange of their affection. Feminists who don't have biological human children are a minority and don't describe female nature.
I loved this song so much and the part where she was in the water 💦 amazing
Her mind. Her mind is amazing
love this song to death!  don't necessarily buy into the subliminal political/feminist inculcation vibes but it's tote's whatever.  fav part: 2:34 "a place so corrupt..."
sou fã
IF I HAD THE PRIVLIGE OF FIST FITTING THE SUPREME COURT I WOULD PLAY THIS SONG WHILE I DO IT
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.
wow es como una sirena
God only knows how much I love this woman!!!!!
Gawd she's amazing
this shi fire on mute 🤘🤘
PPL ARE NOT TALKING ABT MARINA ENOUGH
Love her suggestive big-picture songs and how-does-world-hang-together hymns.. wondering if she's read Bruno Latour (rip) ... And that Range in your singing woman, damn!
… amazing
Gotta love how feminists always bring up misogyny but never misandry.. cause thats what they are misandrist.. females in power? Yeh that worked out well for bloody marry, Wu Zetian, Park Geun- hye, Ranavalona… the list goes on. Theres a reason women aren’t in government.. they weren’t meant to lead 🤣
Perfeita a maior
cant stop listen this song
aprendi com os melhores me recuso a errar
I love
new world order? seriously?
i love marina so much she needs more recogniton
This ICON deserve more 💖💖💖 thanks to Tiktok i knew her on 2020
I'm a misogynist so i just stop singing along for the part about women making up 1/4 of the government
Seeing this live is so cool😭
Amo, amo, amoooo esta canción, la letra es otro nivel y se sabe
Finally coming to Utah. Can't wait 😄
Ela postou esse Clips 6 dias antes do meu aniversário, fiquei feliz kkkkkkkk
Hahahahahaha! "Capitalism made us poor" - My God that's the funniest, most ignorant statement I think I've ever heard! What is with the deluge of young women who think they know everything? That's the poison if you ask me.  Socialism is what made us poor. Government getting involved in free markets and regulating them into dogshit, to let other countries to outcompete on prices and force all production jobs abroad. Crony Capitalism is what allowed socialism to run rampant.  Anyone who wants to know the truth should go find Peter Schiff, his 'I am the 1%' video will illuminate you as to why us being poor is the government's fault. Then do further research on what capitalism ACTUALLY IS, and how free markets are the reason America was able to not only produce all of the best goods domestically, but was also the richest country in the world for decades, even today it's barely holding on, over half a century after the socialists got their grubby dirt covered paws on regulatory power and fucked it all up. Louder with Crowder has a good mini-documentary on how socialism destroyed Atlanta.  As for Weinstein- dude was 100% killed by bought-and-pair-for cops to hide secrets.
if these had lyrics on the screen too, it would be the cherry on the cake.
TFW the video is over a year old and there are still no one explaining the symbolism in the MV.
"God forgive America for every single war"
I like how this feels from the perspective of a woman of Gaia but it has not gone wel still. We lost birth control rights the pendulum. Swung again
Holy shit is the water cuz rising sea lvls? Goosebumps
Te amo Marina
i see
The line “where angel flesh and blood is sold” is this in relation to the sex trafficking in Hollywood?
I'm new to Marina. Based off these comments you'd think she's a huge artist that's been around for 20 years. Just curious, how big is she really? I only ask because my wife is at a Panic! concert right now and Marina is the opener. Never heard of a huge opener. No disrespect to her but I pride myself in my music knowledge yet I've never heard of her and she's an opener for Panic!.

Dorothy from Wizard of Oz
What happened to the diamonds?
Yawn.
Marina My Love !!!
Finally, I have found a blunt leftist song lol
watch out people, I think Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion would have adored her music <3 <3!!!
Love this song
Love this song
when the world ends im listening to this lol
It's giving MarinaVision 📺🔮
Easily her best album yet
Amazing song
Hay esa canción la amo demasiado siento que es una de las canciones que nunca voy parar de escucharla me encanta como Marina hace todas sus canciones la amo 😭💗✨
GRITALOOOOOOOOOOOO💋💋💋💋💋
Freaking love this song 🥰 (my friend forced me to listen to this)
Still listening everyday and everyday ♡
Me encanta
Minha música de ouvir no ônibus
This mv has always given me major rocky horror vibes, mainly the gloves, the lips and the pool I think
2:31 I LOVE THIS PART SO MUCH
I was so hyped to hear this song in the new Pretty Little Liars reboot!! I hope it brings some new listeners in ♥
🤯
Dollar loan
ate
she literally does not have a single bad song imo omg
Just found out a week ago about this underrated gem called Marina.  Amazing voice, lyrics and artist. She's a punk girl in the pop music!
I love marina
I think a Marina and Dua Lipa collab would be incredible!
K am I the one talking about how Dorothy's ruby slippers are in this video??? As a few of you guys know Judy garland was abused and harrased on the set of wizard of Oz but sadly she died prob around the 70s or 60s r.i.p Judy garland
We need this song to be found
PLL Original Sin <3
Os sapatinhos da Dorothy 🤌
AOC brought me back to marina after years 😭💖
Хороша мелодіця і відео ряд   є щось в тому , прикольна діваха)
She is the poison. “Mother nature”? Bet she never leaves her mansion. Take a look at the third world. The people are dying, and the nature is there
britany shaved her head and all we do is call her crazy
This is a modern version of we didn't start the fire and I mean that in the scariest way possible
AMAZNG STUFF MARNA KEEP T ALL GNG, NEED AND  WANT T SEE YU PERFORM THE LATEST STUFF N CONCERT PLEASE, NEED YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yaaaaaaayyyyyyy
Omg was that a rocky horror picture show reference in the clip?
her songs and their lyrics give so much serotonin <3
Shes 🔥
Niceeeeeeeeeee⭐⭐🤩
MISTICAL BITCHES🤘🏴‍☠️
The more we move forward the more relevant the EP gets
Harvey Weinstein gone to jail 🤘
my biggest flex is that this was posted on my birthday
Genius writing lyrics and musicwise
TESSSSSSSSSS
YES MOTHER 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just whent to see her AMAZING
"Capitalism made us poor." in Spirit Marina? Poor in spirit or financial? Because Capitalism made you rich Marina.  A lot richer than what you'd be making in Socialist country. I know she gives 2 charities but if she wants to be making what she would within Socialism all she has to do is give away more cash, a lot more.  She's worth 4 million. Less than Sanders (who owns 3 massive homes/mansions.)
Marina never gets old
this sounds like something that would be from charlie and the chocolate factory that the oompa loompas would sing
Her music is *chef's kiss*
Love the Wizard of Oz reference 🤗
Marina, a millionaire: "capitalism made us poor"
We have heard everything from humble pie to atomic rooster , the cult , the cure , joy division and played every note of the major scale Infinitum backwards and forwards while enjoying All literature from17th century to now  , viewing art , living life ,just doing what is required  But this material if heavy . Obsessed with Mariana ? Yes we confess   Most important artist in a very long time
LYRICS IN THE DESC TOO??? Queen
She's awake of what's the real going on in our world it's True fact
Marina Couleur sing about biggest tragedies in  history and every one would vibe to it
Mind blowing 🎶
“End of the story” line is so powerful. It’s time to end sexism.
Bop
Purge the poison 💯
Queen
Your music 🎵 is Fabalous!!! Love the Feminine energy helps me feel happy 😚
"Harvey Weinstein gone to jail" That was also the text on her shirt in the diner scene in the Venus Fly Trap music video, right?! I just noticed that, Its a really cool detail!
Marina what a bop
It kinda reminds me of we didn't start the fire
This album is froots mother
im glad i meet her in the ancient dreams in a modern land era 💙
this song is everything 💗
the family jewels vibes
Haven’t you guys had like two lady prime ministers ?  And they were both shitty conservatives who didn’t do anything about global warming.  Kinda undermines the eco feminist message of the song
Lyrics <3  All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master" Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? 2007 when size zero was the rage Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed Harvey Weinstein, gone to jail Me Too went on to unveil Truth and all its glory  The ending of a story It's a new world order, everything just falls away Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are, are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far, far
Where have you been all my life?
this song will be forever in my playlist IT MAKES ME FLY
Listened to a lot of your newer stuff, I still find myself going back to your older song "Oh no"...  I loved that song. So catchy. Cool story. Easy to relate to.
perfect
Blood is sold like how people of power kidnapp children and torture them to make a drug out of their blood😳
Is this a parody or a real video?
it’s giving modern we didn’t start the fire
Truly a gem of an artist
I love Marina but girl- capitalism did not make us poor lmao, my family in pain fighting socialism rn.
I love this song so much.
Wow
don"t forget
Little known fact I dated marina once  but we broke up because I'm jealous af about how marina can beat contra for nes without the code and I  couldn't ...we all make mistakes it's All about acknowledging them and then attempting to change that s*** day by day , just so y'all know tho I don't mean marina d. Mine was actually a marina m. She was kawaii af tho lol
My friend has started to assign me a  nightly/morning Marina song to introduce me to her music, today is the first and damn they chose a good song lmao!
It’s been a year and I’m only just realizing it’s “you forgot that without me you won’t go far.” And not “you forgot that we don’t need you what the fuck?” I feel like a legally registered fool
Marina I love you, please come back to Colombia <3
PURGUE THE POISON BEST SONG.
Happy birthday still a bop
HAPPY BIRTJDAY TO THE SONG THAT AMFE ME A BIGGER STAN!!!

TE AMO MARINAAAAAAA CASA COMIGO
Cool song, but why the hell is this video recorded in 4/3 aspect ratio lol It's not 1999.
This should be the protest anthem of a generation. We have SO MUCH WORK TO DO.
i love you, i love you marina, thank you so much
this is one of the best songs I ever heard in my entire life.
Maravilhosa essa música
ginamet q toh as background music sa pe yasssssss eh homophobic pa naman teacher namen AHGSHAGHSAGHAH TULOY ANG KABAKLAAN

She's like the author of dark fairytales fused with relatable lyrics! Beats out Katy Perry, Britney Spears by far! I put Marina and Charli XCX together on a playlist... similar styles; like double the pleasure! Love her! cheers
ESTA CANCIÓN S UN HIMNO Y SÉ SABE
this song and video ate down! i listen to this all the time
I LOVE YOU MARINA<3
God forgive America for every single war...guess what its at war with Russia again sigh!!!

This video deserved so much better, only 4M views is so sad 😪
I love her music
This era deserved better!

we are aging sunshine, we are both from 1987, and we are aging...
healing our damage
GET LOST THE QUEEN IS HERE
<3
Inspiring and love her and her songs/lyrics. Louder the better 🙌 🎵🎶
Holy fuck she really threw shit on the fan!
I love her concept to! You got a strong and nice voice and one with a message!  The only thing I could give you feedback on is the high angelic voice, which I do not like in all the songs. Yesterday I was critically listening and though, manny of your songs would be so much better with less use of this voice. I this song it works because it’s like you’re quoting Gaia.   The fact that I’m a male will surly play it’s parts as well. It’s not ment as a negative comment, just an opinion. A little hard to be honest about it because as I understand it, it’s part of your branch or your personal stamp. But again it’s not wrong, but sometimes ‘to Much’ in my opionion.   Never the last, the songs carry a real strong message which resonate with me. You’re a beautiful and creative person!  I’m not very good expressing myself in English, so to add “comment is really just a positive criticism, but whom am I to tell you how to do the thing you’re good at.”   Keep enjoying the process making these songs and the transformation that comes along with them!   ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
marina seems like she would be down to just go do witchcraft in he woods with a small coven, let me come with in this hypothetical scenario lol
I am so fucking hype that she's using her full vocal range again, she's seriously a top 5 singer for me
This gives me We didnt start the fire vibes
the message that her music brings is so inspiring
All of her music is so timeless its amazing to see
Love and fear was better album...she's repeating herself
This would be my profile song on Myspace if Myspace still existed
Idk....Marina's music has been radical in the industry since the start. She know how's to fit an entire message with prose and all into a pop ballad. I often felt an off kilter vibe when listening to her, so crisp but over time I realized it's really a rally, a scream broken down into beautiful symmetry.
BUT THIS IS SOO CREATIVE- 🖤💚🖤💚🖤
Marina you are a pure goddess, you are the divine in human form. Your power is high! Please do keep the great work of your wisdom going, flowing globally. Peace, love, unity. /\
Hmm, catchy. The rhythm is quirky.
como amo esta canción! 💗
Euro Pop lov it!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok im witch gay agein thanks Marina
marina envelhece q nem vinho
Now my system is full of this Song, thank you 🤎
All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood then she says but your home is now your prison..the satinists put it right in our faces and yet dumbed down society just can't seem to wake up it's disturbing really. She is pushing the feminist movement and telling men our masculinity is toxic. This world is going to burn with everyone and everything in it
Venus fly trap vibes. 💚🌌🪐
You are worthy to be the one and true Witch Queen.
Aaaaawesome! I love this 😊💗
based marina?????????????

Love the rhythm of the song, lyrics are deep as always, singing is flawless
Is it a Rocky Horror reference, or a coincidence. I'm gonna assume it is for my own enjoyment :).
Only 3 millions!!!!!!
Not a feminist, stand for capitalism, don’t blame men for everything. But I love this song so much.

Disappointed Marina has traded insight and individualism for woke liberal brainwashing.

Queeeenbbbbbb forever the beet
That's quite a lot illuminati symbols... Although very well hidden. What happened to you, Marina?
Omg! All is pure perfection in this song! I really love the lyrics, but i love Marina even more!! streaming it constantly!!!!
Have followed her career since the beginning and absolutely LOVE her. Her lyrics are amazing.
☹🙊🙋‍♀️
OMG
2022 Mantra! So brilliant. Her and her lyrics.
"Capitalism made us poor" . Not really, it's made us (and nearly all residents of the USA) the richest in the world. Even our poverty line is far above the rest of the world.
Does anyone else hear Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start the Fire in this?
Preferisco questo davvero
"NWO" Marina the Brave ♥️💪
The lyrics ;)))))))
E quando esco davvero ti gonfio di botte di persona nonla virtualità per il disturbo di avermi svegliato
Can't believe I've been sleeping on this. Rediscovered Marina and cannot be happier about it!!
The message of Marina's songs always helps me overcome my anxiety when singing for others. Seeing her confidence really inspires me to be a better person.
Don't tell me Marina is in her 30's. Unacceptable. She looks 22.
Spese contenute,io nn investo su progetti m su errori commerciali di nn considerazione e preventivando analogie e variabili conviene di più,ti diverti spendi e recupero alla grande
What a banger!!! It should have 380 000 000 views at least! Great song - top tier.
I have to say this in greek; ΚΟΠΕΛΙΑ ΔΩΣΕ ΠΟΝΟ, ΤΟΥΣ ΤΑ ΕΧΩΣΕΣ ΚΑΝΟΝΙΚΑ
This new album needs to blow up. She’s skinny asf
Yeah we only make one quarter of govt :(  You go girl ❤️🙌
Great
I love Marina and she still my fave artist regardless but this song is so dumb almost every point in this song can easily be debunked with some further research
2:30  "put in psycho white rose - quiet clad of Thanos cold"  I KNEW he was somewhere in the lyrics!😎
Una volta tempo fa nello zoo di Roma ho visto una scena davvero triste impressionante e scioccante,un elefante nn smetteva di sbattere la testa su di un muro,era incredibile tornava indietro e compiva gli stessi movimenti così l ho detto a Corinne che ha realizzato questo tributo sulla foto del profilo a denuncia della barbarie degli zoo,la foto e originale nn ha subito nessun ritocco e un gioco di luce ed ombre nn alterata davvero arte domestica,semplice anonima e d effetto con un po' immaginazzione
This song reminds me of "we didn't start the fire"  But yours is a million times better
Marina is surely the poet laureate of the music world.✍
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see the lips from I Am Not A Robot as a returning character
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh what a 2020 I had! Reborn. The universe watches through my eye's now and loves Marina on my spiritual quest to the point of light. /\
Here because of the news in Kazakhstan.
this is so like unique i've never seen a music video like this and that's why i love her
I Love You Marina for this song! this song makes me feel powerful! 💝
THE BEGINNING REMINDS ME OF MITSKI!!
Slayy 🤧❤️❤️❤️
theres no marina song that can disappoint me
if your jamming out to this on new years 2022 you are a legend
This song deserves way more views
Listening to this almost every minute of the day
One of her worst songs sorry the lyrics are cringe in my opinion
she's Punk
TE AMOOO
Deserves 1 million
I love how she looks so amazing in all her videos and is fairly popular while still dressing modestly. Stars nowadays make music videos that make me feel gross for watching. Your beautiful marina!
omg
Marina me transporta a los 80'
She's trying to wake us up.
Diamonds are a gays best friend 🥰💗
marina nunca faz musica ruim #faleitoleve
this is so amazing omg
Marina gives me such positive vibes.Even if its sad song
Tiene pinta de los años 2000
randomly found this artist and wow her musics are catchy
Banger
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCHHHHH!!! ACCCKKKK!!!!
Can anyone explain the Dorothy red slippers reference? I can’t wrap my head around it.
The first verse eminds me of the hippies in once upon a time in hollywood <3
Ohhh 👐👍👐
чет не очень ей все же прогрессив
i dont know why but this gives me 'we didn't start the fire' by elton john vibes
que buen tema
Marina criticizing and pointing out the flaws of society is my aesthetic
Perfect
Vídeo sobre o Electra Heart em nosso canal ❤️❤️
Don’t ask why…  *but this gives me major Shrek vibes-*
Sei fantastica
*silently searching for a paragraph abt what this song is abt*
The Dorothy I know ! ✨
Hello Marina Super music 👏👌👍😘💕 Video 🎥 very beautiful Pozdrawiam z Polski 🇵🇱🤗🌷
ok but why all of her songs are so good??
If Mother Nature was embodied
Thank you Marina for reminding me that i am, in fact, a heterosexual
If she wore a strappy bikini this bitch could find a way to make it look classy af
7 months since this and I still crazy for it!!!😍😍😍
I'm fucking HERE for Marina calling out all the bullshit in the government. Fucking queen!
I just have to put this out there: YOU NEED TO MAKE A SEVENTEEN MV!!!!!!
for the authentic experience watch in 480p
❤️
this song is a buzzfeed article put to music
I want to meet her friends.
Rocky Horror anyone?
thanks bestie
The references
my fav marina song
Its greate
So this is the new "We didn't start the fire". I'm down for it.
Capitalism has made us poor! All power to the workers!
I think she said: "we women are beings who can walk on water, we should rule the world" or i thought too epic :) anyway she is the best
holy shit the lyrics are so amazingly well written but it's also a bop?!?!?!
Sounds like Ultravox with an female voice, but really nice :)
Her voice, Her aesthetic, Her Lyrics, Her Face, Her Sound  I believe in Marina Supremacy 🛐
A masterpiece
Brazil loves your songs, Marina. All of them are pieces of art. <3
I love this song ❤️
Holy fuck. I'm a 56-year-old lesbian who only JUST discovered this incredible performer. I'm entranced.
I love Marina.
when you feel 2011 vibes from Marina's music videos, but its 2021... i feel old
All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood Whilst society is fallin', we are quietly reformin' Protectin' the planet, healin' our own damage  Quarantined, all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doin'?

So, why is capitalism bad again if it made you rich and popular?
The I am not a robot reference was so good
Than Q
Marina I love you
When so many voices shout with her "Harvey Weinstein GONE TO JAIL" - epic! this album is a grand symphony
still AMAZING months later. <3
ANGIE AMA LA CANCION JIJIJI
This is a really pretty song. I hope that things get better for women in the world, support coming from your local trans guy
Well that was amazing!
This reminds me somehow a bit like the song 'Sex Yeah'...
Stunning  Saying everything that needs to be said  Praise you sister!
This song and Man's World are incredibly misandric. MARINA is ruining herself. She's better than this. Terrible woke stuff is not good for MARINA's career.
Just discovered the artist from that one meme video but I did not bring myself here for that. I salute MARINA for this straightforward and powerful song.
Shhh I just learned that she is libra ♎ kie me😀
SO GOOOOOOOD
MOOD 🧚🏻‍♂️🎃
e eu que vim atrás de bronze e acabei encontrando ouro! kkkk pensei que ela cantasse músicas mais calmas estilo Lana Del Rey, mas felizmente me enganei:) Tô há três dias nesse vídeo ouvindo repetidamente. AMEI!!!💓
Marina speaks Truth.
Pqp, que mulher lindaaaaaaaaa
I love this
I love her :(
This the type of lyrical content we need from somebody and Marina did her thing. I will be repeating this over and over!
It's your own decision but your home is now your prision!
Mom imma le$bean
QUE JOYA!
Kinda iconic ngl
Linda nunca errou
FAVORITE. SONG. EVER.❤
peituda metida <3
BONITA DEMAIS MDS DEUSA AAAAA
Politics in Music - always disappointing
I still obsession about "All my friend are witches"
This album feels like I’m on drugs
Damn, Megan Fox stole your outfit for the Met Gala!
The song is awsome, and I truly like Marina, however I do have a curiosity about 1 verse "Taking back what's ours", when in human history females had a better position in society then now? What "back" is she reffering to? You can't take back something that you never had, you can only fight for more.
Magnificent Marina!
so good ily marina <3
she performed this at a nyfw show and her voice live is so godly…literally the same as the recording  update: i saw her in concert and this song brought me to tears. she says she’s a witch but i say angel
i will listen this song on my way for school.
The song is sooooooo catchy, but the lyrics are some leftist, feminist bullshit. Damn, that's disappointing.
Yaaaassssssssssss❤️
VERY BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING......I THINK I'M IN LOVE......YET AGAIN!....OMG YOU'RE SO AMAZING MARINA....I WILL CRY NOW..
Coven Vibes
Shes so beautiful I wish I knew her work out routine 😫
marina no sabes cuanto te amo <222
eu queria colocar essa musica pra todos os gados do bozo escutar!
been listening to this on repeat for a week
Canción que debería de estar en los número uno de todas las listas de todo el mundo y afortunadamente esta en mi corazón Que chingona mujer!
“Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazy” FINALLY SOMEONES SAYING IT
OH JESUS YOU'RE GOOD LOOKING WOMAN ACTUALLY..REALLY I COULD LOOK AT YOU ALL DAY,YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND MAGNETIC...I LOVE YOUR VOICE..OH MARINA...WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR CONCEPTS FROM..SO COOL AND HONEST...
ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED SONGS BY MARINA
i swear feminists are gonna take over with catchy music
@Marina, why does this song have the same opening beats as Horrible Histories - Dick Turpin?
I can hear Family Jewels distinctly in this one, especially vocal part in chorus. I'm really glad the new songs sound like the old ones.
This album is amazing, Marina is a beautiful artist - her voice, the visuals, the message, it all entrances me
Her best era is here!! All four singles are top tier and the rest of the album is insane, too. Marina doesn't disappoint 🔥
what a MASTERPIECE!!! incredible! im feel honored, awaken and wordless!
Comrade Marina ⚒️
she looks like a jjba character
So is she a real witch, aka worshiping the Lord's enemy?
It took me a while to understand the concept of the album, but this really slay.
Pandemic anthem
Coven vibesssss
MARINA go Russia
Is she pagan if so  thats swagggg
hey guys I'm not used to do it but I don't feel like I have the choice. I make music since I'm a kid and just started posting my things after many years of anxiety disorders. can you please check it out ? only one like or one view would mean so much to me.. thanks ❤️
People really complaining about her acknowledgment. Like bruh, I listen to artists who only get 3,000 visitors on Spotify per month. This is scaring me like she if she gets millions than where the hell is someone like Justin Bieber being view caused I’m caused at this point It feels like everyone knows her already but they don’t 🤯
This song feels like the 21st century version of, "We Didn't Start the Fire," and no one can convince me otherwise
0:41
Why did she change her name from Marina and the dimonds to marina?
Marina is literally perfect
Marina is magical.
All songs from this era are so good !!!! 🤧🤧🤧
Te amo 😍
Humanity is the poison.
I was very surprised by the resemblance of Marina with my sister when she wore her hair down
I love the idea of mother Earth passively threatening us like misbehaving children. People usually portray her begging for help, as if the planet is the one in danger. The planet will be fine, we are the ones who are gonna die.
NEED THAT POISON =2021
I love Marina but the lyrics are kinda contradictory. In Venus Fly Trap she sings about being a millionaire but in this song she sings capitalism made us poor. Don't try to be political while at the same time having a different agenda. Peace out.
I can’t believe I’ve been listening to her for over a decade. It’s a privilege to have seen her grow over the years Her music has helped me grow and discover myself as well so I could never repay her for that ❤️
Eco-feminism, forest terfs, worship nature and the womb.  Supporting nature and natalism is supporting the patriarchy, conservatism and abrahamic religions.
You claim to want to purge the poison yet you work in a industry that spreads poison You say capitalism makes us poor then benefit from it the most you’re a walking contradiction you really are a pop star
Stop with "Marina is underestimated" Marina is very popular and her concerts are always sold out. She doesn't sell her soul like the others and it's fantastic ! I prefer her like that than corrupt. And this song is a fu.cking proof 💪
Ok so does anyone else think that she is in fact practicing, cus her vibes are very much pop witch
AAAAAAAAAAAAA 💞
About to put out my reaction to this entire album! Stop by and check it out! :) Thanks!
Purple galaxy amazon
Fun fact: this is her audition to camp rock
0:51 in love w this part omg
Amazing!! Freedom for all!!💕💖👍👍
Love it
Did she just talk about new world order? Lol only woke people will get it
Next I'd like some MARINA MOOR :)
this gives we didn't start the fire vibes and i'm living for it
Merece todo o reconhecimento do mundo!
amoooooo essa musica da Lady Gaga

There is no one more adictive out there jajaja
This is not a song, this is a documentary.
The parte NEED TOPURGEFOROURSYSTEMUNTILHUMANBEENSLISTENTELLWHODTHINKUARE gave me fucking life
“Virus comes, fires burn until human beings learn”
Probably one of my new favs.#freebritney
ALWAYS MARINA
She is SO underrated.
Marina is a Goddess 😍
🖤🖤🖤
She always, ALWAYS brings something fresh to the table. Never one to settle for what's trending or the same sound, Marina is all about what inspires her and creativity!
You guys did marina start the freebritney movement , we have to go free Britney , me marina iJustine and the diamonds
esta cancion es una joya, no se porque no se hace conocido, me encanta
"All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood. Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood" <3
OUR QUEEN ❤🔥
I love this part: “It’s a New World Order, everything just falls away”  Loving these lyrics  Loving this song LOVE YOU MARINA!! <3
Listen this in slowed
“Owning female power, taking back what’s ours” 🧡
I love capitalism
Wow, I love women
Mystical bitches 😎😁👍 I am so in love with Marina and her style. I rock out so hard to all her tunes,  not a bad one among them. I am especially in love with her jumpsuit in this video, so fucking cute.
Is Marina a based antivaxxer?
Teamo
I LOVE YOU MARINA
The message of the song is so nice tho
i always here the lyric "capitalism made us poor" as "capitalism is a whore" which hey same energy lol
as a witch, i am obsessed with this song
ESTOY OBSESIONADO COÑO PERO NO PUEDO DEJAR DE ESCUCHAR ESTA OBRA DE ARTEEEE 🥴🥴🦠
Nid shu posion for mi sistem an the human him 🤓🤘
Me trae loco
obsessed with all the makeup looks for this video! 😍
I’m leading all her new songs because I’m going to her 2022 concert
BIGGGG rocky horror vibes
This is not old MARINA vibes. This is future and present MARINA vibes. Also 0:55 makes me get wandavison vibes.
Every second marina album has been pop or like what was popular at the time but I think she’s gonna continue with the indie alternative style for the next album
Magic 🪄… it’s Marina.
You can hide many fuckin things in this world...but never the fear and suffering from people's eyes...it doesn't take a Genius, it takes an emotionally aware enough person or a kid...And I would never manipulate for gain, I do it mostly to analyze people and shit...turns out, that was needed more than ever...you're welcome!
her when she contracted covid at a party:
Coming back here after she tested positive for covid after going to a party!! Purge the poison indeed!!
Thanks for you marina EEUU 🇺🇸👋🏼
Im about to make a drag performance of this song, this is not just a song, this is an anthem!
Omg such a great song.
"capitalism made us poor" yea right Marina Lambrini Diamandis from Warner Music Group

3M 💖✨
3 M 👏🏻👏🏻🌪🌪
The lyrics are great, but the video is contradictorary
Esta canción es realmente un veneno muy adictivo, buenísima WOW
I absolutely LOVE this song, "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home!" "capitalism made us poor" "Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazy"  then all the references that at least I recognized, the red slippers from the Wizard of Oz, the lips from the Rocky Horror Picture Show! This song is genius and talks about important issues, for example environmental issues and feminism, love this so much.
my favorite
Unfortunately the uultra rich do not feel this way
who dislikes something as magestic as thiss
bitches it should be GLORIFIED
One-quarter of the government? Lucky you! It’s 5% in Poland...
Marina we have Birthday on the same day! I like you Music ! You are for me the female freddy mercury!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is *_such_* a bop, good god!
i can't believe it!
Pls don't misunderstand me. I really love Marina and her songs. But what I don't get is the fact that she's singing about mother nature but uses in almost every video plastic, like glitter for her face etc, that easily becomes microplastic. I don't get that logic, really.
THIS SONG IS LITERALLY A COMBINATION OF SAVAGES & WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE- I'M SCREAMING IT'S SO PERFECT
Virus come fires burn until human beings learn
this is absolutely terrible
Збс песенка 👍
Shes so fucking weird I love her
*communist twerking*
THIS SHIT IS GOOD
AHHH MARINA QUEEN👑
Notice how when she says "gone to jail", other voices are saying it with her. It's like they're all the women he hurt. All the women who made the going to jail happen. Brilliant detail.
🤍
This is pretty bad
Great song but the main critique is that is does sound savior complexy
Can we just appreciate the amount of effort that is put into each of her videos like 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😧😍😍
you are not my master !
Capitalism made us poor. We need to purge the poison. Preach
*Gay Witchy Twerking*
YouTube recommended this MV. I heard MARINA's music for the first time! I love it. From Japan with love.
Why she kinda look like Azzyland tho
Our beautiful feminist queen
PlanetMarina
One song you're saying. You're not here to conform and then in this song you  spout off about wanting to be apart of the government. I thought you had a brain for a moment.   If anyone know's what government's really are they wouldn't want anything to do with them. The behaviorism and actions of parastitic philanthropic sociopaths degrading sanity, logic and morals out by legislating legalisms and underminding real consent. You want posion out of the human population?   You can understand history or you can trust "government." You cannot do both.    The State's criminality is nothing new and nothing to be wondered at. It began when the first predatory group of men clustered together and formed the State, and it will continue as long as the State exists in the world, because the State is fundamentally an anti-social institution, fundamentally criminal. The idea that the State originated to serve any kind of social purpose is completely unhistorical. It originated in conquest and confiscation -- that is to say, in crime. It originated for the purpose of maintaining the division of society into an owning-and-exploiting class and a propertyless dependent class -- that is, for a criminal purpose. No State known to history originated in any other manner, or for any other purpose. Like all predatory or parasitic institutions, its first instinct is that of self-preservation. All its enterprises are directed first towards preserving its own life, and, second, towards increasing its own power and enlarging the scope of its own activity. For the sake of this it will, and regularly does, commit any crime which circumstances make expedient.
This is for sure my favorite song from ADIAML!
This lady is a cultural reset , purge the poison is just omg .
When I'm listening to this I feel like I'm on acid 🙃✨
#FreeBritney
BROO THIS IS SO GOOD
okay so i know that marina's probably not bi, but... she does the bi finger guns at 0:33. so what am i supposed to think
Love u ❤️❤️❤️🇮🇹
i discovered myself as bisexual after listening to marian for the first time
This really cured the depression I had in 2017
Seriously marina is giving us a message we really need to think about how ridiculous this world works.
This Song reminds me everything that humain being had done and how cruelle how humain can be
0:00
That britney line says a lot now they really have her as a slave in front of everyone and all the press did was make fun of her
all my friend are witches..<3
We stan
Iconic
PLEASE IM OBSESSED
I like the song, very nice to listen along with froot. That being said the lyrics contain a lot of bollocks aswell.
"God, forgive America for every single war" - Well I sure hope God forgives America for the Punic wars. Jk jk Anyway I love Marina, she's an extraordinary artist and her songs are just amazing, though dark af at times
This is my fav song on the album with the beautiful and bittersweet Goodbye !
SHE NEEDS TO BE *PRESIDENT*
#freebritney
If the lyrics weren't so awful, this would be the perfect song
“You forgot that without me you won’t go far”  “Hey there it’s me the team’s only lady, throw like a girl and I punch like a baby...but my heart is strong and my wand is too so try to keep in mind that without me you’d be so screwed.”  I never thought a marina song would remind me of a song about Final Fantasy but here we are
I just ran into this artist about 15 minutes ago on Spotify--I'm already obsessed.
é a melhor do album sim
This sounds like Garbage.... No kidn
God I love her
SLAAAY SLAAAY
My favorite MARINA video is "Purge the Poison"
This song is equivalent to snorting thirty seven lines of cocaine
I love how Marina makes a meaningful lyrics in each of her songs like damn I can use these lyrics to do my homework essay about COVID
Can someone explain what “studded with a diamond dew” means I tried looking it up but couldn’t find anything
I love what this song means
i love you marina i love you
‘Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday.’
she's gone so woke its sad, where is MARINA AND THE DIAMONDS ?!?!?!!
isso precisa de mais reconhecimento
Te amo Marina
We didn't start the fire part two meets Sparks.

I love how this song sounds like it’s from the early 2000s
I’ve JUST discovered her as she was featured in Apple Music. She’s weird, but amazing!!!
i don't need oxygen anymore, this song is all i'm going to breathe now, thank you Marina :)
i'm so sorry, i can't stop laughing with the beginning because it reminds me of the “we rock” song from camp rock 😭 still such a masterpiece
Can you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Thanks to all musicians for making life better! I know from my own experience that life can get tough, but if you listen to good songs you can get through it and keep going. Made some playlists for many moments in life. Come listen to them and leave me your opinion. I'm getting started. Thanks!
hi iloveu
I hear a big Abba influence, love it 😀
Just wrote a review for 'Ancient Dreams In A Modern Land' at themusicsanctum.com. So proud of Marina for this work of art!
Record label: What budget would you like for this video? Marina: Keep it, I don't believe in capitalism! I'll just wear what I have, lol
these lyrics are so bad marina what happened to you....
no cause why is this song so addicting
Help this song makes me hate men
Cringe
She's flawless
MARINA WE MISSED YOU

I love how 2020 brought back the 1980s
it’s like a modern “we didn’t start the fire”
I think this version is better more than audio
OMG THIS IS A MASTER PIECE 💖💖💖 Thanks Marina for all 💖💖💖
I love this song! It reminds me of a more upbeat Savages

you are undervalued
The new album is EPIC! love it!
Μαρινα μου ελα ξανα στη πατριδα για συναυλια!!! <3
YAAAAS 🔥
She’s always killing it with her lyricism, sis can spit facts and bop
bro, i can't stop listening to this
Marina is the literal perfect specimen . The hair, face, bod, mind, heart 🖤💓 all perfect to me
*MARINA FOR PRESIDENT!!!*
WHAT A LYRICS! JUST WOW❤️
this is a masterpiece
So so beautiful <3
I’ve been listening marina’s music since I’m 13 and am so thankful for growing up with her <3
this song forced open my third eye and made it Realise
💖💖💖
I'm really obsessed with this art.
this is such a banger
She’s so gorgeous <3✨
She’s older than me (I’m almost 17) but I’ve loved her music since I was a kid and it’s educated me a lot on current issues in the world. She’s also helped me love myself and have lyrics I can relate to. As well as spreading great messages ❤️
Starts off like Go-Go's "We Got The Beat".... and the rest is, well, Marina. Yeah, let's listen to Marina :)
This really purges the poison. After listening to the whole album my life quality improved as much as 47634874%
I’m a new fan because of this amazing album I love her 💞
the wholw album sounds very "marina" i love it so much
''God, forgive America for every single war'' I really LOVED THIS ONE
The rapid-fire, socio-economic verses remind me of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start The Fire," but with a feminist bent. Love it!
Pandemic music video productions be like..
🥰
This whole album. My god, revolutionary. allow me to say something I usually abhor: YASS QUEEN
Can't describe my infatuation with this lady - so much admiration for what she does. Unique for the times - and clearly not bending to anyone else's ideas for her. In the Music industry... can't help but Stan and Respect this Artist
I love your new album marina a big hello from coventry band the eyes of isabel
<3
David Lynch would love this
Thanks Marina for that history lesson @ 1:22 because that’s all i can remember about 2007 too 😅
this video has me convinced that Marina herself could be mother nature
I just realized the red shoes are a reference to the Wizard of Oz because "there's no place like home" (earth)
Marina siempre sorprende
Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home  virus was released, fires lit for profit until human beings learn, Illuminati sh*t you are not my master" Need to purge the poisonous illuminati, reclaim our humanity

This is my favourite song right now.
Marina didn't start the fire.
This whole album is ICONIC
❤
Love this 💕
We will Purge the poison 🤩☣
amazing music/music videos you've been releasing recently <3
Indie Marina is back! It suits her better! 😍
*anti-capitalist twerking*
OMG THIS ERA IS INCREDIBLE
Who else is here after the album dropped
i just wanna know marina's work out routine and diet
This gave me froot vibes when I first heard it and the rhythm reminds me of Savages
Amazing how she puts so much truth and social-conscious themes in her music and at the same time looks good doing it. The power of pop music.
Bravo!!!!
I'm obessed with this old-new marina
This is smacking into me hard than Family Jewels I'm crying!!!
Okay Marina why do you always have such synchronizing music. I think I'll always love you. I'll still never forget the chance I lost in Montreal at the Metropolitan I think its called you were doing Electra Heart. I was a young teen almost got the chance to come see you then. It was a shame I didn't but I never stopped listening to you nonstop.. That wouldn't change concert or not.
I feel like I can finally experience what everyone else did in 2015
@Marina The Poison we need to purge is the "Elite" they pushed greed, consumerism, planned obsolescence, capitalism and gave people no other option to live free and now they are putting all blame on us, like putting people in a small space, not letting them out not even for bathroom needs and complaining that the cage is filthy and that the people are to be "depopulated" because they are destroying the space. Created the problem and selling the (fake) solution to the masses for they don't need slaves anymore with robots and AI
Who is she???   How have I never seen her until now???  I am uncontrollably and irrevocably in love.
im loving this new era
I love this era tbh
#1 aqui em casaa eveeerrrrr amo a MARINA, queria tanto q a bichinha hitasse, mas de qualquer forma hita aqui em casa 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Seriously at 1:13 is giving me sailor moon nail transformation vibes & then at 1:17 her ruby slippers are giving off wizard of oz vibes !!  Just me?? Or is marina not only a lyricist but she’s symbolic too ❤️❤️ I wonder what she is saying in all this
when i have grandkids, i'll tell them MARINA was one of the BEST artists in my generation.

The only bad part in this song is 3:17

Só queria um feat com rina sawanna e com a Pabllo :))
O sucessor do froot!
♥ SHE IS THE HUMAN EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE ♥
*hits crack pipe* Capitalism made us poor.
Okay, I am a bit of a metalhead at heart and I kinda dug Ancient Dreams but thought that was a bit of a random and guilty pleasure. Now I've heard this, I am preordering the album and looking forward to hearing the rest of it! This is gold!!
I looovveeeee her so much. :D
Amo esta canción, no me canso de escucharla y disfrutarla
MARINA IS BACK
Marina invited 80's
*twerks politically*
Absolutely perfect
Virus is far from being gone here in Brazil
Oh gosh!!! Yeeeeesss Ms Girl!!!!
People can have an opinion, but calling this cringe is so stupid. You guys will listen to 21 savage saying shit about his red clothes every second but marina writes music about feminism and you guys Just love to hate on her? Is it cus she makes her own music ??
This is so good it gave me chills.
Over ten years and her music is still top tier.
I started maining Viper after this Song
I love the music^^
Absolutely brilliant!, i love Marina, her songs and videos are always amazing!
Love you Marina ❤️
God this song is good. It kinda reminds me of Billy Joel’s we didn’t start the fire.
This is the purest representation of MARINA
New wave twiggy?  Marina on her best ever.
she is so feminnine
i thought it was impossible to beat teen idle, but this is actually her best song ever
This song reminds me of the cigarette song
vintage marina
Forget whether I commented on this truth bomb 💣 Marina bop already.  Loving the direction of this album
I feel like she's the only one who addresses the shit that happens in this world
Te amo mi poetisa Griega hermosa
✨Sororidad  💜 sisterhood ✨ Queens here 👑🔥🌬️🌊🌱
I can feel myself getting skinnier ✨
🦕
I need more I need AN ALBUM QUEEN!!! ✨✨✨✨
I love this song!! The chorus gives me goosebumps
I'm so obsessed with her look though-
All the Rocky Horror Picture Show vibes 😩😩 Impeccable
Ancioso demais pelo álbum rainha

her lyrics r really bad, they sound really cramped up and some what like performative. this song sounds like she in trying to be some kind of woke leftist savior but in reality shes just a millennial
Love it
gurl, this was CAMP
The editor behind this video is an absolute genius.
lenda
Wow more identity politics ... how original.   You are better than this Marina.   Both these singles come across as lazy.
absolute queen. marina is my religion
I think this is officially my favorite MARINA song now <3
queen.
This song is so underrated
<3
So basically, TFJ era is portrayed by Marina in that gorgeous translucent dress and curly hair, Froot era by that yellow onesie outfit  and ELECTRA is out of sight just showing her red gloves , red high heels and ofc her red glow lips. . . . .    Let me believe in my lie ok
Need to purge the poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen especially to kill Kuzco, Kuzco's poison. That poison?
okay i cried. like.
Marina always knew the assignment
Queen really said 'capitalism made us poor'  We have NO choice but to stan.
yoshh
it’s your own decision, but your home is now her prison. She’s got a point. I love her news songs about feminism and Covid and Mother Nature. She’s amazing
Te amo Marina, amo esta canción :3❤️‍🔥🕊.
Poisonous twerking
I'm pagan I so get this
Love it! Got old marina vibes
ugh this is amazing! marina you absolute queen.  an absolute bop with an incredible message. I could listen to this on repeat. As for the actually message.. I'm doing my best right now. I want to lessen my carbon footprint but I still live with my parents who thing climate change is a sham. I do what i can, like thrifting for clothes, but when someone else controls transportation and money, it's nearly impossible to break free from them.  yesterday was the first time I ever put up my hair without a rubber hair tie (used hemp cord), and yeah, I've had long hair for 18 yrs and used rubber ties all through that but progress is slow, and I do what i can
timeless goddess 💕
2007 britney shaved her head -
💖
This is hilarious
wow i cant believe MARINA invented clapping
It's funny how it looks both old-fashion and recent pop
This is so "Family Jewels" + "Froot" I just ADORE IT
I have never been in fandom before or called myself a fan of any artists but sheeee issss sickkk all her songs Oh No and BUbble gum bitch etc shes such an icon
She's like so pretty
I seriously love u so much lol
Come to Brazil again pleaaaase, São Paulo! I boght the first Loolapalooza and the next year I couldn't go and miss your show! AFTER COVID PLEASE COME BACK AND SING THIS AMAZING NEW SONGS!! <3
obsessed w this
LOVE U MARINA1111
💜
💖
How can this woman never stop doing better songs then the previous masterpieces she has done just before
Extremamente icônica❤❤❤❤
A socially conscious song for our times...I dig it ❤
It’s about time we got our generation’s we didn’t start the fire.
I’d pay a good $3k for those guns 💪
Does the refrain "a place so corrupt where angels flesh and blood are sold" reffer to children traffic and murder to farm adrenochrome? 🤔
Amen
Also Marina just found out bitch and witch rhyme and needs to use it in every song, like emo 11 year olds who think their poets vibes
Say ‘I’m not popular enough so I have to pander with surface level identity politics’ without actually saying it
Heck, Marina. I knew you were a great, like, really GREAT singer. And you have a song for almost every life step I've made so far. I'm back to being my true, philanthropist self. Having you as a friend must be awesome. Fighting capitalism and saving the planet does require strong women in powerful roles.
we didn't start the fire vibes
Anybody else thinking about the line wherein she sings  “You forgot that without me you won’t go far” like Electra Heart was singing that? Lol
Queen
gays and they’s, are we here?!?
Quedé knoqueada. Ayuda.
Song of 2021.
No one in The World is The Government apart from United Nations (U.N) why do you vote for political nonsense when you can invest and vote in The Official United Nations. The U.N will always Enforce its Good Will!
This is the true retro..
Lyrics:  "All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage  Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail Me Too went on to unveil Truth and all its glory The ending of a story  It's a new world order, everything just falls away Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are?  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far"
I wanna be her I love this human being  so good

Ah, what to do if I love the music and hate the lyrics
nobody: my brain in the middle of my final maths exam: *_NEEDTOPURGETHEPOISONFROMMYSYSTEMUNTILHUMANBEINGS-_*
This is like a modern day “we didn’t start the fire”, I love it!
Love this kind of songs, especially for mental health and positive messages 😊
this reminds me of marina in 2010-2012, im loving this

What a fuckin legend i'm gonna cry
Gonna play this on repeat forever now
Greek Icon
She's beauty and brains and heart and soul
The old times Marina we've adored back then ! :)
HI :D SHE LOOKS POGGERS! HERE FROM ANCIENT DREAMS CUZ IT POPPED UP IN MY RECOMMENDED!
#FeministAnthem
Obrigado, amiga. Você é uma amiga. Serviu muito.
I just found out that she was born in the mid 80-ties. :O! WHAT AN ENERGY!
I've never heard of Marina but this song keeps coming up on my Facebook feed and I have to say it's damn catchy.
Ahhhh, I am so sad I have refunded tickets from your last tour due to the pandemic.  I hope you will consider coming to Phoenix again :D
Why 1,1 thousand dislikes?
you just can tell how much fun she had making this one
This is like a great lost 70s Sparks song
Im so ready for this era!
Love the Wizard of Oz references <3
I love u so much <3
I like some aspects of this song. But the liberal viture signaling buzzwords is just cringe. I thought she had more artistic integrity.  edit: this is song actually slaps and she has a point.
she, she, and she. <3
These new songs make me want to change the world. This is Marina's world domination!!
**natural witches twerking**
So now we know the new album will have at least 2 songs that rhyme "witch" with "bitch" and that make reference to Mother Nature. I mean honestly, that could be every song on the album and I would still love it.
THIS WOMAN FEARS NOTHING 🌹🌹✨✨✨👑👑👑👑👑
So many outfits I can do inspired by this video alone 🥰🥰
Loved this song!!!!
Further proof that you either die based or live long enough to see yourself become cringe.
That’s what’s called political/ social  pop ;)
+hi
This is Marina, takes me a few listens then I'm fucking hooked! 💗
Marina, você é necessária nessa industria e nas nossas vidas. ENTENDA ISSO. Te amo! ♥
THIS SONG
Anyone else get Kate Bush vibes from Marina?
I love this merge of old tumblr and modern day vibe
How can she look SO GOOD in EVERYTHING SHE WEARS????? Illegal!
Ugh! The energy! The speed! The voice! The choruses! UGH! Won't descibe it!
the colors reminded me to "suspiria"
The Family Jewels vibes. Plssssse yes marina saving the earth
This melody brings very powerful, inspiring emotions. Releasing all the energy and consuming all the love that exists in the universe.  Funny thing the lyrics is also about that. This shows her talent and depth of her creativity and consciousness. Everything fits into place perfectly.
"we didn't start the fire" for gays
Marina t amo
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
A queen
*INHALES DEEPLY*  needtopurgethepoisonfrommysystemuntilhumanbeingslistentellmewhodyouthinkyouaaaaare ARE???????????  *dies*
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
well, marina's been spending a lot of time on tumblr lately.
Love it
Gracias por ser tan sincera en una canción pop.
EU ME ARREPIO TODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
op
Normaly must be a chartbreaker
Marina viene más despierta que nunca en esta nueva era.
Anyone else getting some really heavy " we didn't start the vibes"
Qué bueno estar vivo para este momento _
most simutaneously pro- and anti-gilead song ever written
Thank you mom
Te amo marina
This song is an absolute banger
I just dropped on the floor with tears This song is PERFECT
I need Marina to make pop music again and not this weird parody Weird Al type of music. Get her some writers.
It begins like something from Ultravox!!!! Excellent!
te amo muito
I'm so happy she went back to her old style!!!!
How is it possible that Marina does not have 100 million views on each video? Can someone explain to me what is wrong in this world?
the beginning gives me anime vibes
Beautiful song!!!! Love the vibes, love u marina! ^^
I want to live in a country where this song is the national anthem
Marina if somehow you read this, know that I love and adore you :,)
The political jargon and modern feminist goofiness in lyrics hurt it......but overall this song is incredible !
When she talks about taking back our power as women, girl hell yes! But how can we do that with all this confusing stuff going round about gender lately?? Come on, I can't be the only one here!  Where's the strong women who see through this?
Capitalism made us poor? What does that mean? 😕
NEED TOPURGEFOROURSYSTEMUNTILHUMANBEENSLISTENTELLWHODTHINKUARE
I am really proud of Marina and how good is her music and really love the direction she is taking with her career   BR 🇧🇷🇧🇷
"britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed" sadly true, britney deserved so much better #freebritney, love u marina 🙌. UPDATE: BRITNEY IS FREE Y'ALL 😭😍🙌💖💯❤✨🎇🎉🎉
time and time again Marina proves herself to be absolutely based
Fuckin 2021 anthem!

💗💗💗
*communist twerking*
Perfection 💕
mamãe ta entregando tudooooo
New world order- Freemason hints in this song.
Marina is one of my fave artists !
Q U E E N ❤
<3
Who else came from ADIAML? 😂
this is so cringe
que clipe incrivel 😩😩💜
Okay I my brain can't take the yellow dress. Then the light/color effects. Then she starts swaying.  So sorry Marina you only get one thumbs up.
💜💜💜💜💜
This era is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who’s her after ancient dreams in a modern land dropped 💎
MARINA, YOU´RE FCKING ART GRLL
A place so corrupt where angel flesh and blood is sold. Love the reference and this verse
She is truly an artist majority of pop stars could never claim their work as truly their own and do it with such talent
just did a drum cover for this masterpiece ☠️🪄
sick
That second verse tho    1:22
I hope I one day have a daughter as pretty as Marina. 💜
Am i the only one getting "We didnt start the fire" vibes?
I'm sick of all these messages because I'm not the one actually killing the planet. Corporations are. But this song is too much of a banger and anytime Marina is doing anything similar to Electra Heart again I will love
We Didn't Start the Fire vibes of 2021
God forgive ISRAEL for every single war.
💕💕💕
This reminds me of the I’m Not A Robot video. It’s so good
YAS THIS GIVES ME OLD MARINA VIBES I LOVE IT
Marina you are awesome!
i've been listening to marina since college ten years ago, and came out as nonbinary this last year, I really appreciate her language evolving over the years to be even more inclusive & welcoming. she's one of the few artists i can sing along to without feeling like i am misgendering myself. 💜
omg so misandristic
Very strong female vibes - i love it <3
Im sorry but the very start always gives me flashbacks to the durarara op
Shakti slinging enlightening volts🤟🏽⚡️
I really love this video, marina is a queen
I'm obsessed w this song 💚☠️🧪
Cada vez que Marina saca una canción nueva una parte de mi vive de felicidad. 💗
Marina you are simply awesome!
Hermoso
i feel like this has a lot of the same energy as We Didn't Start the Fire
This is a cultural reset
Made it to 2M views finally! Needs way more but congrats witches 💕

I'm as straight as males come but Marina has convinced me to side with the feminine. As I have and always will

marina is dorothy with her red shoes from the Wizard of Oz
Elle parle du nouvel ordre mondiale she 's a pupet of illuminati.
Finally an energetic song🙌 Missed a lot this beat, congratulations, Marina 💚
Só eu acho ela parecida com a Alexandra Negrini??
first of all: this is ridiculously awesome! :O  BUT! Does the melodie remind anyone else of the intro of rainbow brite? ._.
Music is awesome, lyrics are trash (for the most part).
I love Marina with all my heart. You are such a brave woman with so many important messages using your music. I would love to see you in real life to tell you that!
Her and Lana del rey are THE queens in my opion
So is she saying Corona is good and capitalisme is making us poor. She lives in Hollywood and everyone should care more about a rich girl with a problem, Britney.
I love you songs
people are eating her up on twitter bc of the lyrics but there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the lyrics
''And Crawling on the planet face some insects called the human race, lost in time and lost in space and meaning''   - The rocky horror picture show
The Earth is sorta crying at the beginning
Woke garbage.
Capitalism made us poor, hell yeah! Eat the rich 😈
I love it sooooo bad!!!!!
Cool song by Marina. You can check this one as well, modern rock song with old shool sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAkn2RsNFfw
That's the Marina we love! Amazing, great, brilliant!
Anyone else getting like intense tv series intro vibe?
Such an important message! You go Queen!
Marina, Bravo!!!
2021 Version of We Didnt Start the Fire. Periodt.
I swear Kim Wilde and Florence had Marina as their love child.
Big the Family Jewels Vibes
That green outfit 🥵
Marina is a queen
T^T♡
Queen 🥰🥰 That's the kind of music we need ♡♡♡
There’s so many elements in here that are like classic Marina it’s crazy
i am living for this video
not it every time
That’s so her loved RHPS references
Less than 100k views before she gets 2M! Let’s do it! 💎💕
Love the Rocky Horror inspiration for this video but love the message of this song even more
YES PLEASE
This is so much better than the fake Madonna ...
Idk why marina isn’t as big as Ariana grande and billie eilish etc. She’s smart beautiful talented funny her music always seems to have a story/important message...  Be better people
BOP!!! SLAY
YESSS
One of my favorite artists
This mv turned me straight.
this sounds really similar to we didnt start the fire
gives me a headache.
is this a different version? I remember it quite different when it got leaked by Marina herself
love the rocky horror picture references
YESSSSS
Coven Twerking <3
What’s her obsession with Hollywood lmao
OK KATE BUSH
I’m being forced to listen to this
I can't believe that the revolution will come from women and gays OMG
lmao I'm sorry, marina's feminism just screams  "liberal girlboss mom" 😥😥😥
THE BEST SOOOOONG
Giving green 💚 music
QUEEN
i love this!!!! excellent
One Month to ANCIENT DREAMS...
And oh yeah beware of Maya the illusion
I like the undertones of the song but where is the enlightenment? Where is the teaching? No reference to gen 11:6 just wearing my colors doesn't mean ya actually joined Marina. Sometimes I do regret telling people anything.thoygh I never thought you'd be one of em.
This gives me MGMT vibes
This is fucking awesome, i am here in my laboratory in México all fucked up, turn on the music and appears this awesome song, thanks marina, saved my Monday and my week and my life
the aspect ratio rly sells it for me
1k people who didnt like with no music taste..
Cool music, awful boring vomit-inducing lyrics
I like it
Okay but we can talk about the powerful lyrics she wrote like WAKE UP WORLD
Marina is everything 💓 Masterpiece, we need more you!! Love you!!!!❤️
She's saving humanity with this one
Is this a nod to PJ Harvey's "Down By The Water"? Loving it.
YESSSSS MARINA. Family Jewels mixed with Froot is the vibe I’m getting here.
GOD IS WOMAN SIM CARALHO
imagine lana del rey and Marina together *0*
wow ♥
MARINA ERES INCREIBLE
Does she even age ಠ_ಠ
Marina - the woman that really is able to purge the poison. Good luck, Marina.
She sings about Britney... You are all witches
t amo marina
The way I had this song on repeat since it released! I LOVE everything about this song! The vocals, the instrumentals, the message, the visuals! I am OBSESSED!
1,840, eight one zero
Пожалуйсто добавьте русские субтитры
i don't think ppl realize how smart she always have been her songs are bops and they carry a lot of messages. this song alone 🤯🤯
This gives me To be Human, Savages, Man's World era vibes.
the shots of the red lips give me rocky horror vibes and i love it
Cuanto arte
conspiracy theorist marina talking abt new world order ..
brasil? alguém?
Love + Fear Acoustic EP And The Family Jewels VIBES!
I’m just crying she’s a literal goddess
She's such an icon and I genuinely love all her music
Sorry for being a capitalist
Jesus! THIS IS AMAZING
*woke twerking*
God forbid America, so true
amei a musica...  que vídeo horrível foi esse gente
Strong Final Fantasy 7 Avalanche ideology vibes. Barret would be proud.
..which side will YOU choose?..
198k views until 2M let’s GO!!
i’ve gotten back into marina in the past year again and please shes still amazing. she really raised me through my middle school and early high school years it’s so great to see her being still so iconic
is anyone surprised Marina is a Green Witch?
I love this!!! Totally MARINA vibes!
I really don't believe it.... It's the best song of my life!
Misandry, misanthropy, sjw and political correctness... What a mess!
The lyrics and the beat are amazing omg I'm obsessed
Marina's Greek free spirit its so intense... She is a Modern Philosopher... Powerfull lyrics In her masterpieces. 👏M🌿👏A🌿👏R🌿👏I🌿👏N🌿👏A🌿 Εύγε!
Eu amoooo
Toujours aussi bon ! j'ai hâte d'entendre son prochain album le 11/06 !!
Legend❣️ 🦄
So at least a million of these views are mine... WHY ARE Y’ALL SLEEPING ON MARINA?? 😛
ancient dreams in a modern land is going to be so good omg
The lyrics are just amazing
love
daily dose of poison-purging
When I heard Numb I wondered why Marina wasn't on the radio.  Then I heard this song, and now I know.  Nobody will play real music, they just want pop drivel about people wanting their bae back or partying too much.  I'd rather hear her real music on here.
PLEASE tell me I'm not the only one who thinks Marina looks like young Princess Leia
Marina 's 2nd single is still going Good hope she'll keep those goodies  coming .  Am i the only 1 who thought Love +Fear was a Nice Pop album but it was too long ( too many songs got lost by overpowering each other )
I want to see her in concert!!!!!!
yeah I'm a guy and still love this song
We need this song in just dance 2022 with that green outfit she had in this song!!
google bookchin <3
cringe
Not another red shoe, damn. I really liked her
Love this song !!!!!! 😍
1K users hate mother nature
I like Marina a LOT but sometimes her music as of the last few years just gives me White Woman Feminist™️ vibes...................she gives me "aMEriCa iS ThE rEAL pRObleM", "dOEsnT fOCusINg oN rAcE mAKe It wOrSe" vibes.......Im not saying thats who she is but thats the vibe I get from the music lately and I fear that those types of people will think that by simply listening to her musis, they are "saving the world" and "not part of the problem"
AWESOME but why did I think it was Marina from Animal Crossing singing this tho?
Tava com saudades dessa Marina
Marina, você é perfeita! <3
Real cuestion, I'm drunk. Why u left the Diamonds ?, Ergo, ur fans?.. i dnd't see the asnwer
Fine wine.
I can't find the button to give one million likes to this queen.
i really love this song, theres a part when shes sings sounds like Die Antwoords Alien
I'm back for I think the 100th time since it was uploaded 😭  edit: I'm back 4 hours later cuz this song is the one thing keeping me sane.
capitalism DID make us poor, thats right!
Get the Tories out!!!
OMG, I can't believe that Marina's just invented feminism and ecology at the same time
Why is Marina so fckng gorgeous?! < 3 o < 3
“Capitalism made US poor”????? ain’t your net worth in the millions?
love the Wizard of Oz and RHPS references😍
This reminds me of no doubt/Gwen Stefani. I know marina is a fan of Gwen.
Obviously I agree with the message, but I would just love to be able to go to music to escape all the political stuff. But I fucking love the Family Jewels energy. I've been yearning for this for yearssss.
I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS SONG
I love marina!!!
as tyreen once said: I love, LOVE IIIIT!
I loved it!!
*purgative twerking*
Marina mode "old school" is back!! I love her anyway!
Anyone else reminded of we didn't start the fire?
I needed this era
I am venezuelan, comunism make us poor, i love you marina but you cant talk about something if you grew on capitalism and enjoyng capitalism...
OMG MY QUEEN IS BACK! <33
Marina has been my favorite artist since her debut. And I liked Sia too for a long time.
omg Electra Heart vibes! i've been waiting for this. <3
Por que esse hino não hitou?
Love U Marina!
Witchcraft doesn't end well.
I think Marina is a witch who works with Aphrodite
These dance moves are eco-friendly. Mother Nature approves!
kween
HOW YOU DO THIS QUEEN 🤤😍
Am I the only one who is sooo obsessed that i watched the lyrics video atleast 20 times just to worship the lyrics?🤯😱🤩
MYSTICAL BITCHES should be a track on the album!
2:17
💜💜💜
This was a jammer
Let’s get it to 1.7M views, only about 35K left. Let’s go!!

Cada vez están más hermosas tus letras <3
Himno
Perhaps the poison she's purging was Radioactive
socialist twerking
I see the message behind this, too bad most of the people are at sleep. Im ready for nwo or at least i have backup plan when everything goes to "shit"... good luck everyone you will need it (:
My fave parts are 0:39 and 2:29😫

ecofeminist twerking
*IM HALF GREEK HALF WELSH TWERKING*
I love that they use Dorothy's ruby slippers Marina you're amazing girl
как прекрасно) как будто старое видео)
FROOT vibes
Love the Britney quote, love Marina ♥️
my birth year in a song which has the best messages in it and which belongs to MARİNA💗
This is everything and all the commenters know it.
OH MY GOD
this is like Savages pt.2 :")
She's got it....over years
First time hearing the song, Me: okay it's good its good.. After listening more than 10 times: *claps everywhere*
I’ve missed this sound so much
I liked the way she tunes her voice!  does anyone know more songs in this style?
I lalala love you
1:02 Vibes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show!
I'm obsessed with this song
looking for Marina and the Devil
“A place so corrupt angels flesh and blood is sold” is that a line about human trafficking? This is dark Marina 😳
is this about what happened in 2020???
Watching this video two days straight.. last time this happened with Beck's Colors video. Must be something with the way it's cut or something :D
linda
Ai, ai... Gostei
Shes definitely going to need a teleprompter when she sings this live.
*woke twerking*
u know i appreciate the sentiment I guess but this feels deeply performative
Think it's super cool she used to idolize america and now criticizes it. Growth!!!
I just found this today and am on my 21st listen , help
They sound nothing alike but this song reminds me of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start The Fire" the way it lists pop culture events 😂 loving Marina's music! 💕
her slay...
Te amo Marina, te vi crecer como artista y ahora te veo crecer mentalmente eres una diosa 😭💗💗💗💗
this is amazing
Bravoooooo from Germany! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼
The lewks.... THE LEWKS!!!!
She has blessed her lgbtq+ children once again😤😭
I LOVE THIS OMG
This woman can never make a bad song and when she's going off with free artistic expression and intended message it's art with a purpose.
This song reminds me of star trek for some unknown reason
This song absolutely slaps. This might end up being her best album yet.
Yesssssss old marina vibes I love it
It’s a crime I’m only hearing this now. Especially since there’s a character I write who’s songs have big MARINA vibes and this is fits way to well
I can not agree with each statement but love the song.  P.S. That "all lefts and rights reserved" in the beginning of the video.
We love the message
Maravilhosa em tudo que se propõe!! <3
Marina is aging so beautifully! Hot damn i'm so jealous of her voice, her looks, her kindness and her talent. ❤
q hermosa mi reina
OK PURRRR M,ISS MAAM
Thank you IG algorithm for suggesting this when I was adding music to a story
I've listened to this song abot 1000x now!! Bumping your statistic on Spotify, mystical b*tch 😜
MARINA > MARX
HERE BEFORE THE REMIX DROPS
Stream girl from rio guys
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE WITCHS!
I don't like Marina's songs but I am obsessed with this one !!
KEEP STREAMING HOLLYWOOD WITCHES
ITS GIVINGGGGG 😩 VERY MUCH ELECTRA HEART VIBES
LA MUJER DE MI VIDAAAA
GOD I'M OBSESSED
To Be Human but make it  ✨spicy✨
u n d e r r a t e d
I am part of a cult devoted to worshipping her. First time listening to her songs and my decision to join this cult was valid
I've been watching you for years and have no idea how you're not one of the most famous pop artists on the planet.
Me encanta la canción y es hermosa
Essa coroa não sabe cantar nota 0000
Can’t stop listening to it 👏✨✨🤯
The most underrated ARTISTTTT
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE DAY I DON'T LISTEN TO THIS MASTERPIECE
I love you!
I love her and this is great sonically but lyrically it sucks... I go to music to escape the depressing bullshit in life not be reminded of it
this song is such a bop
Amazingggg🤩❤
🤍🤍🤍🤍
thank you marina for reminding me that i am, in fact, a lesbian
I am 36 years old and I am litterally growing old together with Marina, who is about my age. About 11 years ago I saw her live in concert in Berlin and met her afterwarts behind the stage for a quick chat. This event was so inspriring and I still keep this concert as a special memory in my heart. Her voice is so unique - I never heard a female artist anywhere coming near. And her lyrics are so smartly written. She is just a genius. An outstanding artist!
*glittery twerking*
A M É .
Georgeus  song with a powerful message!!! We are all the earth❤💙💚 Im obsessed.
I will be listening to Marina in 2051 if this technology still exists lol
The song was great... until Marina basically called herself a communist in the chorus. That really ruined the song for me :/
Ok, great song, but "all my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood mystical bitches" gives me terrible vibes. I dont know how to explain it.
Me, in the background: “Aaaahhhh Aaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaah!
I love this marina, "Who do you think you are?"
Influenced by R.E.M. "It's the end of the World".
The old Marina is back!!!
Excellente musique
This is brilliant. I thought Electra Heart. I always thought Electra Heart underrated. Yes shades of the others but I feared she was losing her way a little after Love + Fear. I saw her twice in 2015 and she was brilliant with her band. I felt a big mistake to disband. I hope they return, when they can. Oh, and the first part of Poison has shades of Billy Joel's "We didn't start the fire". No bad thing, that's also a great song.
THIS IS SO ICONIC OMG
I love this. Marina's music has always been thought provoking and addressing humanity in one way or another, musically I feel like this is an evolution of everything she's done before. I have LOVED the journey through her music career and I think all of her music is great, I can definitely hear aspects of all her albums here come together in a new but definitely inspired by the past sound - it's come together so well and this song is so perfect for the world right now.
I am a HUGE fan of Marina, so I do NOT say this lightly, but I honestly think this is my new favorite song from her. It really is perfection.
This song ACTIVATES ME. GO GREEN AND PROTECT THE EARTH AND THANK YOU TO EVERY WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO HAS HELPED HAVE A MAJOR POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE. IM A BETTER PERSON BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. RIP TO MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER WHO WAS TAKEN FAR TOO SOON FROM CANCER.
This song reminds me a lot of ''Oh No!'', i'm loving it so much!!!
Wonderful track, Marina!
Marina finally snapped and became an avatar of nature's vengeance and I couldn't be more here for it. <3
YASSSSSSSSS
I love this artist so bad!!! 🪔🪔🪔
Dear Diamonds,Let’s make it 2M before next Sunday.
This could've been EPIC if the clip was an animation. Pity she lost the opportunity to actually project herself :/
GREEK GODDESS
Love of my life
This song needs to get on Genius 💯
Essa música merecia hitar tanto
🧪NEED TO PURGE THE POISON FROM MY SYSTEM ☠️

Clever song...
Marina is the gift that keeps on giving.
t amo marina mi onichan

God I’m literally in love with her
ily marina
pretty
queen
Anti-capitalism 😍😍😍
giving me real Lana Del Rey vibez and i love it
who is lady gaga?
my queen
"Capitalism made us poor" Marina: is worth millions      It made us poor, not you. Idk why we pretend that celebrities are anything like us, they have more money than we could ever spend. They aren't suffering through the pandemic, they're locked up in their penthouses bribing their way into any inconvenience covid causes them. Critiquing a society that has granted you the ability to soar above the common folk pretending you're just like us is so out of touch. So fake. So nauseating. So Shane Dawson.
Why does this give off Electra Heart vibes?
Electra heart with 80s vibes😫❤️
Omg 😃 I love this song ❤️ well done Marina ..
QUEEEEEEN!
This gives me vibes like it's a modern day "We Didn't Start The Fire"
This song is sooooo fucking good omg! Really gives me Froot vibes and I LOVE IT ❤
Worst song I've heard so far this year
All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master" Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? 2007 when size zero was the rage Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail Me Too went on to unveil Truth and all its glory  The ending of a story It's a new world order, everything just falls away Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far
So excited for the album
Let's get inspired to not lose hope and do everything we can do, even little things, to make the world a better place for everyone. We have to fight against the absence of justice in a lot of situations. Be the person who inspires and tries to teach people to respect and help the others and the world we live in.
Needs more claps
everyone who listens to Marina, you are the best! and she is a preacher of truth and justice 🛐💕
2015: Do you really want me to write a feminist anthem? 2021: Okay then
Modern day 'We Didn't Start The Fire'

GOD FORGIVE AMERICA FOR EVERY SINGLE WAAAR, NEED TO PURGE THE POISON FROM OUR SYSTEM. She sounds like a goddess like her voice is like angels in my ears

It is 2021.  I have known about this goddess for a decade.  HOW has the world slept so hard on Marina?  So much talent and realness. I love her so much.
This is like the fusion of the every persona of Marina. We can see Froot, Electra Heart, TFJ and Love+Fear.
Omg Electra heart vibe here ♡♡
I come here every 8 hours this is like medicine

mujer mía te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo te amo
so good to have Marina back, really excited about her new album!!
wizard of oz and rocky horror picture show references i wonder what they mean?
Hey Marina!! This song has been living in my head for a week now. I may need to ask you to start paying me rent… Thanks!
You're my comfort 💖😊
OK, time to read Eco-feminism theory. Thanks, Marina.
"Capitalism made us poor", you would know girl
this was uploading on my birthday ebebebebe💕💕💕💕
THIS IS AMAZINGGGGGGGKASJDKSALDJSAD
Melody is nice.   Now I'm not trying to start shit but the lyrics are drenched in virtue, good in itself but in execution comes off as a wee preachy. When I think of bands who push for humanitarianism I take more seriously those who do shit. System if a Down is raising funds to fight for their homeland, real third world problems that has been their message has consistently been since the 90s.
☪️
Always been one of my favorites :)
Such old Marina vibes! Love it!
You were niche music in 2012. Now literally the gen z's are like wow this is the stuff.
Marina comunista!!!
She's so underrated omg
Queen
😫❤️❤️❤️✨
Look how she's grown
A QUEEN
The Rocky Horror reference was 👏👏
This sounds like 'We didn't start the fire'
This song gives me hope🚀☀⭐🍦💖
SHES BACK YALL ITS NOT A DRILL

A BOP 💗💗💗💗
YEEEEEEESSSSSS GO MARINA!!!!1 ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMSZ!!!!! AYYYYYYE
Aaaaaah eres genial Marina :3 Love u ❤❤❤❤
Ah ma allora è viva
Marina is so relevant thats why shes not mainstream. To be mainstream you have to be all about sex and be in. But Marina is.not all that. Im still here since her family jewel days. LOVE MARINA!!!
I AM CRYINNNGGG I MISS THIS MARINA SO MUCH
The Greek Goddess has spoken
the part with the echos literally sounds like a siren song. IM OBSESSED
Greek twerking
como eu amo senhor como eu amo
This is so art 😍, I feel like this duality! Song’s rhythm gets me up but lyrics are just brutal! Hits you like a bucket of cold water! How much damn truth in a song! I love you forever marina 💜💜
Yesss! i'VE LOVED EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE AND POP IS MY FAVORITE! I'm definitely here for the pop queen vibes! Love you ,Marina!
Fuck yeah! ❤
Can we refer now to Marina as to Comrade Marina? Pretty please?
Mmmhhhmm, we on board. Griahtapot. ♪ About time. ♥
The family jewels were lost! Electra heart was broken! Froot is rotten! Her love is dead, now all that's left is fear! Now here Ancient dreams in a Modern land!
Im obsessed 😍
imagine a marina x rina sawayama collab. THE POWER THEIR LYRICS WOULD HOLD
Same vibe as "we didn't start the fire" and you can't tell me otherwise
OMG
this gives me so much electra heart era vibesss
marina is such an inspiration
check mago and apple by gfriend for more witch pop
2:12 Miss ma'am sounds very ethereal here 😌💛
Wizard of Oz references, 90s Gwen Stefani, 70s Cher, and Wild Things/Jennifer’s Body 💖💖
Cant wait for the album omg
Family Jewels album mixed with bubblegum bitch I am ALL about this vibe
Love it!
This is awesome! Marina rockin' like always!
Marina is for me the definition of what we say "it's a song that i like its music but i want also to know the lyrics" or in my case i Have to learn the lyrics. Honesty that hits you right to the heart, περήφανος Μαρίνα (people in Greece tend to be proud for things that don't really matter and they lose their direction, i believe Marina is a true reason for somebody to be proud to be Greek, and i say that with awareness, i feel that i'm getting addicted to kindness because of her and that feels awesome, i am finding myself more day by day). Ευχαριστώ Μαρίνα!
✨If your voice were poison I would still listen it ✨
Love the new single and your new look, although it’s always Marina style. Love it! Keep it coming!
Some Lene Lovich vibes here
i hadn’t heard this yet and i told my 4 year old we should check it out, and now im here crying. this was so much more beautiful and inspiring than i could have imagined.
*humanitarian twerking*
Durarara! opening vibes? nah just me then.
This is a step-up on Man's World.
Marina always had important subject matter in her music. Whether its depression, eating disorders, or the problem with Hollywood in general. She's an awesome lyricist!
te amo Marinaaaa
In a hundred years historians might call this the most important song of this decade. Thank you, Marina.
dios te amo
I'M OBSESSED
Over 1 million views and not even 1,000 dislikes. What a power move.
2012 2021

i'm fascinated by this song and its lyrics
ily
I deeply thank marina for her vibe🌸🌎🍃🌞🌈
IM IN LOVE WITH THIS
She gets so so much prettier the older she gets istg
QUEEEEEN
TFJ vibes seeping through makes me so happy😭💖
can’t stop listening to this
I'm glad to see you again Marina. Very glad. <3
ms marina queen of this century, and also my second mother
she’s so underrated bro :(
Great song but damn. Some of the lyrics were not thought through. God forgive America for every single war? Also,  women only make up one quarter of the government because they don’t want to be politician’s as often. What can we do? Force them into government.
☠️🧪🖤✨
TIDDY SHAKIN MUSIC

1:17 gave me chills 🥺
#Freebritney
She literally gives me nostalgia everytime I listen to her
THOSE OLD MARINA VIBES YEA GET IT I GUESS!!

No marina. Capitalism made US poor and YOU rich.
marina seems so happy is warming my heart  <3
A BOPPPPPPPPP
I played this song for 8 hours straight, over 150 times because I’m autistic and love repetitive things. this song is so good :’)
🖤🖤🖤
Awesome 😍
love the new sound
!!!!!!!
genious, brilliant, perspicaz
I wish her music videos had more budget. I feel like it's what's stopping her from getting big
Kachorra Vibes
Welcome back mamaaaa
Am I an angsty middle schooler in 2013 again?
Favorite song of 2021 💚💚💚
😍😍😍
Aaaaaa finalmente AMOOOO
I like the chorus. Lyrics are kind of Billy Joel-esque, not a bad thing, but it's not a thinker.
I’m here for women taking over the world tbh
i love it
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man, at this point I believe God sent Marina as the new Messiah, no joke 💚
In loveeee
Earth Day is twerking off the negativity and posion.
ARTE
Damn this is literally "we didn't start the fire"!
Hey, love the song, love the queen. but most of the links are not working
❤❤❤
I see she is part of the Cabal and ILLUMINATI WITCH COVEN. BORING
No one taking about the lyrics "shaved her head we all called her crazy"
Oooh, this is a return to a style I loved
this is one of the most perfect things i have ever seen
She's back! ♥️😍
🤘☠️🪐🌞
i might be tripping, but the way the camera focus on the "south part"  of the global map – the part that is poorer and explored by the "north" part... i was like: she thought everything out.
This is already fast for a Marina song but I also love playing this at 1.25x. It would be a fun karaoke song.
obsesionado con esta canción, i lov you marinaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
LOVING THIS VIBE! MARINA DELIVERS ON SOCIALLY WOKE POP 💖
Lost the diamonds?
So . Good.
How come she looks the same😍
Maravilhosaaaaaa 🤩🤩🤩
I love this song but can't get over how Americentric it is
i cant believe marina invented feminism
This video would've scared me if I was kid
omg shes so wicca lmao just kidding. Love it, Marina! Finally!!
queen be trying to fix man-made disasters one awesome song at a time! YOU GO QUEEN!
Marina já está na quinta dimensão 😹❤️ que letra perfeita
Ok but think about the power if Marina and Blackpink collab...
I love this song so much i may die
STREAM EVANESCENCE ♥️
She popped up as an ad! Longest ad I ever watched.
Heavy 80s vibes, bro
TE AMO, REINA<3
♥💪🏽🔥😭🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏻🙏🏼💯👍💥
Α ρε μαριναααααα ααα, αχ αχ αχ
#fansincedayone... I'm so happy now.. this was unexpected.. powerful!
god this is about to be my favorite era of hers
REINOTA QUEEN, no te merecemos
POP HAS MADE A COMEBACK
I LOVE IT
I love her omg
Marina is so underrated she’s is amazing.
esto me devolvio a mis 14 años
Please don't show this song to tiktok
I wonder her thought process for this video like why did she choose to go this route with the neon colors and vhs vibes? I like it though its different from her usual stuff.
rockly shaking
Madonna vibes
i adore u
❤
THRIVING
All people commenting this has "Electra Heart vibes" are terribly wrong in my opinion. Electra Heart sounds completely different from the rest of her albums cause it was more on the commercial side as she explained many times. I obviously did love it of course but I do prefer more meaningful/political songs like this one instead. If I really have to compare this song to the previous albums I would say it's a mix between TFJ and FROOT musically. Lyrically it's a new chapter cause it talks more about social issues rather than personal ones.
fucking smart
I've listened to this song three different times today
i love this so muchh
MAMAEEEEEE
I am here for her lyrics.
lol im a female in gov't and i will tell you the girls i work with are some of the cattiest girls since high school. ill get on the feminist train as soon as girls stop being catty and stop acting like Mean Girls was an instruction manual. i much prefer to work with the men who i dont have to worry about slandering me because they dont like my outfit that day.
All the most boring parts of her other eras :(
I LOVE THIS SONG
MARINA YOU ARE MY MISS MAMA
I owe my life to this girl seriously thanks to her I was able to get out of depression a time ago :')
I'm forever proud of marina
#zeitgeist
This is catchy as… Dam I love it
MARINA IS THE QUEEN SHE IS ALL WE NEED
cringe
Never a miss with her. Pop Icon.
This is everything
The old Marina is back^^ 💕
😍😍😍💚
gimme the family jewels part 2 pleaseeee
Thank you and we are proud of you. Now let's all listen and strive for our best, each others best and animals and earth itself too. <3
omg- yes
Ja shes lit! Lyrically impeccable. Its great and also glad to hear to hear old notes being hit again maturity combined to a powerful new album NO DOUBT!
I think she is such an incredible artist. This work is worth its effort and love
Loving the new music omg just amazing!
this puts my frustration with the world into words, thank u marina
The message of the song is quite profound, but the lyrics are clunky and don't suit the melody. Besides, Marina keeps recycling the same melodies ever since Froot. She used to write very witty lyrics, so I'm somewhat shocked about this drop in quality, this song is an absolute SJW cringe fest. Is she aware of the fact that the British basically invaded every country in the world?
Really feeling like the 90s with these aesthetics and it's so good. Also good to see someone who is in a public view willing to mention that capitalism might not actually be that great for once.
Yasssss💕
She has a unique style, I love it so much
I love Marina music but sometimes I get confused about her visuals. It changes so quickly that it looks from a different project and another album.
holy shit. is this... this is like a Steven Universe villain song. omfg.
This sounds like the Sparks
marina started the fire
Marina se reinvente please  Isso soa Tao Electra heart...😕😴
i request your hand in marriage
This is not marina this is gaia possessing her to send a message to the masses. I- "need to purge the poison from my system until human beings listen..."
I LOVE THE OLD MARINA VIBES UGHHHH <3 WHAT A QUEEN !!
Such a shame your friends aren't actually witches xxx
I want more
Essa musica no futuro vai ser usada nas aulas de história contando todos os fatos que trouxeram a gente até o dia de hoje.
U MAKE ME BALIVE IN MYSELF LUV U
The red shoes and the green light makes me think about the wizard of oz !
Everything is here she has mentioned everything needed. My idol marina
I absolutely love this. Does anyone think the music at the beginning of the song sounds like "sorry we lied" by Blood Orange?
Omg. That's SO GOOD.
i love marina but i dont like how half of her music videos look like they are from 2010 :(
I've moved from a toxic environment, and I've realized so many things. I feel like I was blindfolded, numbed my own feelings and put my emotions away. Everyday my head was in turmoil but now I feel free. I know this has nothing to do with the song and video but songs like these always make me want to talk on and on...
this is good.
So amazing and it's Oh! NO vibes i loved
THIS IS ICONIC I just can't stop listening to this song, I CAN'T!
💚 yay Marina 💚 I thoroughly appreciated everything about this experience
Old marina vibes and new
Queeeeeennnnnnnn
broooooooo wtf this is soo fuckin good omg , this song its being on my head for a lot of time
Kali yuga times are coming
Me encanta 🤩 marina saludos desde Venezuela 🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪
¡APÓYENLA COÑO!
Just have in mind that capitalism is whats making MARINA money, the reason she even is a singer is because the talent she has she can profit from it that is capitalism, so yes the lyrics is pretty flawed again great song thoy pretty nice beats
I LOVE THIS SONG
SHITTY MESSAGE, GREAT CATCHY MUSIC love and hate it
OMG IS SHE BACK!! I LOVE IT!!
im sooo digging the old marina vibes with this?
If you are not a fan, something's definitely wrong with ya.
This threw me back to Family Jewels and I'm LIVING! Your albums shaped me as a person.
giving me girlboss but it still goes hard
This song is so necessary!! 💚
"Britney shaved her head" 💀
Okay but imagine a Marina and The Voidz collab
BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP I LFUCKING LOVE YOU MARINAAAA WITH ALL MY HEART YOU HAVE A BIG FAN IN COLOMBIA
Y eeuu retoma su campaña d.misilws al mando del nuevo presidentee en Siria
TE AMO
Not only is this song amazing, she definitely filmed this either by herself or with a very limited (in person) crew which I so appreciate cause so many artists are really acting like the pandemic is over and have a million people in their music videos that obviously had a large crew. PLUS this video is also amazing quality and is just a good of a music video as any with a large cast and crew! Kudos to whoever editors this because it’s perfect.
im still not over this
Dude, she looks better than ever, so fit and pretty and comfortable!! So excited for her! Thanks marina, love the throwback vibes to your old videos!
WOW! Marina is amazing! Love the lyrics!
This is fucking badass. Love it.
HER!!!!
I love you !!!
“Capitalism made us poor”.......should be replaced with “Socialism”. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Cant wait for the album queen 💕💕💕
Capitalism made us poor
the message in this...... i love her
♥️♥️♥️🌻🌻🎵🎶🎶☮️
I’ve been listening to this nonstop since it came out please
I MISSED MARINA SO MUCH THANK GOD SHE IS SAVING 2021!
Wow wow wowwwww Marina comes back 😍😍😍😍
Marina t amo gracias x existir ❤️❤️
listening on loop all day
THIS IS SUCH A BOP OMGGG
Oh my gosh i wanna listen about trans rights and murders, and masculine powerr tooo, please save white male!!!!
earths day vibes
This Is so awesome.
Man's World (feat. Pabllo )when?
I keep coming back to this BOP <3 It's so deliciously right
When she said "Capitalism made us poor"  I felt that
Ameeei!
Didn't like it on first listen.  The other thousand have been excellent.
I think I've just experienced an awakening
I’m literally in love with her,,,,,,, and this has literally been stuck in my head since being released
Welp. This is definitely a different message than cringe, "Do you really want me to write a feminist anthem//I'm happy in the kitchen cooking dinner for my husband."
THE AETHETICS SJDAJSDJKSD
en mi canal hice un traducción al español de esta canción:)
Obrigada
We fucked around too much got Mother Nature herself make a song
What we are all feeling packaged in a bomb ready to explode! I love you Marina
I pre saved. Yesterday and today I woke up feeling beaten. Now I feel I have a voice x Thank you x
I love this so much. Such true words. We can all relate to what your saying. You tell them girl x
MARINA, O BOLSONA*O ESTÁ DESTRUINDO O BRASIL. POR FAVOR NOS AJUDE
Does anyone see Grimes and her being similar?? Or am I crazy 😭
The perfect song for Earth Day
I didn’t know it was possible for one being to cover so many topics in one song and make it a bop, but here we are
i keep sharing this so much this needs more recognition
Why did you unfollow LANA?
Is she a feminist?
From the title this could be a pro mia song... purge the poison?
She's so authentic!
HOW SHE IS SO PERFECT 🤤😵🥴✨🥺
Escuche esta canción 3 veces a las 3 a.m. e invoque a satanas 🤡

Her best song
I love it! ❤️✨🔮
Capitalism made us poor God forgive America to every single war... She know...
she's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend and she's the moment
💚DIOSA💚
Why does this feel like a feminist "We didn't start the fire"? but I mean that in the best way possible lmao
I think this is the best song I’ve heard this year. The lyrics really sum up all of 2020 which is obviously saying A LOT.
Damn dude, this is catchy as hell!
masterpiece
u cant make one bad song huh? u got froot and a whole bunch of songs stuck in my head now this?!
Menciona lo de britney en 2007 y hasta ella sabe que haberla llamado loca era exagerado #Freebritney
F*ck. I love this song!
comeback of the year
Lyrics:    Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnnie Ray South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe!  Oh wait wrong song...
ugh I love it, she is the best
All the bad and good Racism and misogyny  according to word order misogyny is ALL THE GOOD thing and racism is bad. ok. I got it. YOU are a poison.  please stop using man made internet using man made synths, musical instruments, computers and electronics in a building built by man in a city built by men using electricity produced and invented by men etc etc etc etc and take what is yours - a stone age cave. farewell silly female

I LOVE MARINA SO MUCH I CAN’T

Electraheart meets Froot and I LOVE IT 💖  I AM 100% LIVIN FOR THIS, THANK YOU MARINA
song of the year... sorry, will be 2 years lol
YOU ARE THE MOMENT!
💙The lyrics tho!!!💙 💖I love when you write about🍃 Mother Nature🍃, and of course Femininity! 💖
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Thank-you Marina!
I purged the poison (my now ex).
This reminds me of the Wizard of oz the red shoes the green water and the green outfit the make up it just reminds me of it for some reason
Amo los visuales, ahhhhhhh
love the chorus
Marina can't go wrong <3
COME ON FROOT AND TFJ ERA!!
if this song, or this album will flop, i will burn the whole world down!!!
OLD MARINA IS BAAACK
It's amazing that she even took this risk, beautiful song. Necessary from the place where she stands (symbolically and intrinsically as well). Awesome
This is like if Poison Ivy wrote We Didn't Start The Fire
me surpreendi hahaha
Political shouldn't be a part of music IMO. It's nice rythm tho so thumbs up.
Love you Marina 💜💜💜
We made 1M😊
I loveeeee thiss omggg
I love it
this song is everything
in love
Nobody: Marina: 👏👏 Me: clapping with marina👏👏
QUEEN
Girl you deserve the world
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH, THIS SONG IS ME
Not all heroes and wear capes. Most of them wear beautiful Dresses and singend along with an Angel-like Voice.  Months Ago, i was scrolling through YT and i found an AMV with "Bubblegum B****" and since then, I'am a big fan of Marina. Her music makes me cheer.  "Purge the poison" has purged me alot. Hard Times needs Good Music^^
this is like 'we didnt start the fire' but better
why the thumbs down.....
DIVA
This is the anime opening to 2021
iconic
This is her playground. God she knows what she does so well. That Ah-ha is too good xd
I can’t believe this is a new song. Gotta be the best song I’ve heard in a longgg time
TE AMO T-T AMO ESTA ESTETICA TUYA ES COMO ELECTRA HEART
LOOKING REALLY NICE....
What a stupid fuckin song lol but any IQ can make music.
When she said how fucked the Earth is i really said: 🕺💃🕺💃
It's 2021, I had unfortuantly forgotten about Marina until this came on as a YouTube add and MY GOD I'M HOOKED
Lyrics are naive at best, but DAMN, MARINA MARRY ME PLEASE :(
one million <3
It's incredible how clear this spit elite's plans for us in our face 😔 2030 here we go! At least the song is great
AMAZING
Hell’s bells, she looks amazing in this video!
I'm glad I'm not a native english speaker. That way I can still appreciate Marina without having to deal with the political and moralist stuff. At least if I listen her new songs without paying too much attention, just for the music and her incredible voice <3.
Love this!
April 2021
No hate guys. But Marina’s music is different now... for me, it has low quality. I’m ok with the topic, but the lyrics are simple... remember Savages and the whole Froot. How could I ever compare the pure masterpiece and this.. it’s like she is making low-qualified parody of herself
1 million streams finally
I'm not one of those fans that for some reason hated Love + Fear but can't lie this song is better than that whole album.... her best album coming I fear
Been vibing to this all week, Marina can not be beat!
Britney Shaved her Head and everybody gone crAze
Original Marina Vibes
te amo marina
Me a bulimic: *nervous sweating*
All the straightness and up-front-ness that was Martina... get's lost in blurry reverbs. Booo³
The v-bangs were sported by Αmazon women too or just Natalia?
She’s low-key rapping... I love it
Queen 👸🏻👏🏻✌🏼✌🏼👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
omg the electra heart vibes!!!!!!!
I surely liked the video, I also liked the way she claps her hands.
Promote more this ⭐
Omg this is so 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Unpopular opinion, marina lyrics really went downhill after Electra heart.  Hating on capitalism while proclaiming that she is a millionaire on Twitter. Disconnect indeed I will give it 4/10 and I gave mans world a 6/10.  Maybe she is aging and slowly leaving her peak.
Capitalism made us poor?  No Girl! Socialism and Communism did! Although old MARINA VIBES ❤️
0:55 So clean, i love it!
MARINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! THIS IS SOOOOOOO GOOD! I LOVE YOUR MUSIC SO MUCHH!
Obsessed
👍Marina Forever
every time she says "need to purge the poison from my system" i can't help but think of how cats throw up...that's literally the rhythm they throw up to...
Froot and much more !!!   Hell lotta yeahs!!!!
this sounds just like if was out of the familly jewls, i love it <3
OOOOOH! I absolutely love it!!!!
this reminds me of her old music from 2012 I love it!
MARINA YES

This is so beautifully Marina. She is one of a kind and inspires me to heal and grow.
the poison has been purged <3
I'm so happy to be alive at the same time as her.
I think Froot will always be my fave album of hers
Everybody is anticapitalistic in 2021 and I'm down for it.
OH HEY THERE QUEEN??!!?!!
To think she went from Girls to Purge the poison, we love the character development
THANK YOU
SHE DESERVES

Imagine singing along to these songs LIVE with marina. It wud cause a revolution 💪⚡
The last time popular music had such boldly feminist lyrics was the punk days
*Antes de llegar al millón*
❤
Marina reminds me so much of kate bush
*song of the year twerking*
its not really subtle but i still like it, sometimes you have to explain things to people right
I love this!!!! This is pure ♀️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
sorry kween i forgot i love u <3

✨🔥 Petition to make this the anthem that'll sound when people finally take over the world and dismantle the goverment ✨🔥
im in love
Absolutely love this duo of timely powerful songs and their hard hitting joyous lyrics. But what I want to know is where is the right place to listen to ensure our favourite artists benefit most. Is it YouTube? Is it Spotify? Is it your own website?
Great musician, great song. Love Marina  though I'm not getting along with that "Feminist" Stuff. But somehow it will fit.
Please please pleaseee cover Murder on a dance floor by Sophie ellis bextor

Ela faz tuuuudo
NO SONG OF HERS IS BAD.
Omggg i love it 😍😍😍😍😍
she POPPED OFFFFF
OMG the way I just know she’s coming for us with the album
I don't understand why you guys acts like this is a big self referencial video when it's actually outsourcing to so many other media (the most obvious being Wizard of Oz and Rocky Horror) (this is good thing). Always a delight to watch Marina, even if I don't always like her songs (obsessed with this one though ❤).
THANK YOU!
This is my anthem
Giving me the family jewels vibesssss!!!! Yasssssssssss
she´s coming so strong
Love it ! I’m getting “we didn’t start the fire” vibes
MARINA IS MY RELIGION CARALEOOOO
I'm weak for her looks on this video! What a goddess!
Is this the "We didn't start the fire" of this decade?
Mother Nature has LANDED.
Marina can't ever release a bad song, every single song is a bop
wow! love this!  honestly did not expect this! it reminds me a bit of that Marina from the family jewels ... <3
This reminds me of your older stuff, love it! Please do more bangers like this.
Call her Mother
it feels like the love and fear tour was one of the last fun things i experienced before covid, so excited to see u tour again one day

marina mi salvadora nada me faltara
Ten silver spoons coming after me
Its Been stuck in my head since the realesed
This reopened the Electra Heart phase in my life and I’m just thriving right now💖🔥😭
AHHH CANT WAIT WHEN THE ALBUM COMES OUT 💖💖
There is ABSOLUTELY NO PROMO from her label! I cant believe it! No nothing!  MARINA ITS BETTER FOR YOU TO BE AN INDEPENDANT ARTIST RATHER THAN GIVE % FROM YOUR WORK TO THIS AS S H OLE S!! FOR NOTHING! 🖕👿
🥰
I'm gonna tell my kids this was "we didn't start the fire"
She’s woke
0:34 "You are not my MASTER😝" that was powerful 2:24 Is powerful too
YES old Marina vibes came back! YASSS QUEEN
Never disappoints. Love it.
Marina come back now No one can stop her.
In this song, it feels like the mother nature is threating us to start caring about what nature is going thru.
Ich liebe dieser Lied💖
Artisima.
the beginning sounds so much like the durarara opening lmao
I need to beg people though not to just listen to a song like this, get all inspired and think you're making a difference. You're not. Actually go out and do something and practice what you preach.  Sorry I just have the image of people listening to this and being like *fuck yeah!" then throwing plastic coke bottles in the bin, plastering themselves without a thousand chemicals to make themselves look a certain way, consuming fast fashion, and taking flights to go on lots of holidays :/  Actions speak louder than words, and it's easy for stuff like this to make this ideology seem so cool and glamorous, but the reality of it is hard work and sacrifice, just saying and reminding people.  Anyways, love the song Marina! 💖❤️
the visuals, the outfits, the sound, the lyrics. Marina always delivering
Our QUEENNN has come back ogain
keep on streaming mystical bitches
I die for Marina the pop 👑
can't put my love for marina in words, i've grown up with her and now her every word appeals to me so well that it seems like we share the same brain cell
😘💜
😘💜
MARINA se la esta rifando con este nuevo álbum.
I stream this every day.  My queen deserves her crown
Propaganda bull. She is successful because of capitalism ...ironic song
mARINA OMGSDJGHS
vocals = TFJ guitar = electra heart aesthetics =  froot lyrics = l&f
2007, when size 0 was the rage...I don’t know do much about reference, but I am getting Mean Girls reference there
Let's go to 1M witches! 💚
This gives me the old Marina vibes and I'm obsessed. I love you.
Porque a nadie le gustó la letra? 😐
Love yoooou
...Lyrics in the description say "helped us to unveil", but she sings "..went on to unveil" in the actual song. 1:30 Love the song though <3
Yasss queen
Is this the new "We didn't start the fire"?
Okay, I'm living for this 🔥🥺
I’ll do anything for this woman quite honestly
Those lips remind me Miley's Prisoner🤔 Who we actually made ourselves according to they lyrics😌
How privileged we are to exist in the same era as Lana and Marina.
When i see Marina  i want to start to do workout
Sing For Us Siren!
What is the song all about? btw nice beat
Loove the aesthetic of this video. Wish they gave her a bigger budget. Her music is amazing.
682 didn't purge the poison

Communism made everyone poor. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system. But I guess she gets the woke points on marxist twitter
💕💕💕💕💕
Oh god the old and better marina is back 😍😍😍😍
I'm revisiting this daily... who's doing the same?

Nice, reminds me a lot of Kylie Minogue's Say Something though both are yet different in many aspects
LOVE YOU MARINA

OMFG Vibes The Family Jewels, I love it 😍
PERFEITA
♥
Don't wanna be that person but if Wales ever does Eurovision MARINA  would be the best choice
I lovvvvveeeeeeeee hhheeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr
Este vídeo es una joyita
Yasssss Marina . Love this
just tell us its a quarantine music video already
capitalism made us poor indeed
I'm surprised no-one's talking about the nod to Judy Garland - a tragic poster-child for all starlets chewed up and spat out by Hollywood, ensnared in much the same way that Britney has been since her debut with Disney. #FreeBritney
THIS IS SONG IS PURE MAGIC ✨
I love her voice!
The first 8 seconds remind me SO much off Ship to Wreck. Need me a musician to break down why exactly
*WOAH THIS SONG IS SO MASTERPIECE TNX MARINA!*
Amén
Ohmygod Marina you never fail😫💗 This era is as if Electra Heart had come back from her ashes and from all the hurt bloomed a woman who is done with society's bshit and id gonna call it out  My past young Marina stan would be so overjoted rn (I still am lol)
come back to the orange tree. Not my bag.
Can’t take it outta my head ,this is so fucking catchy ❤️❤️❤️
A RAINHA FAZ TUDO <3
You can’t say it is not catchy af
I'M OBSESSED!!!!
I wish Marina made good lyrics like Teen Idle again. This one feels like a Facebook post. Man's World is slightly better but also poorly written compared to her older works. Also, "quarantined all alone"? Don't be a hypocrite. We know you had to leave home several times to record this song AND the video, you and the lots of people who were involved in their production. But us plebes should stay safe at home, right? Let them eat cake.
Did anyone catch the ruby red shoe reference? She took a stab at the MK Ultra overlords. Britney wasn't crazed.... they ruined her mind.
her music is so fucking good jesus christ, I don't think she's made a single song I don't like
YUH
What a beautiful woman! ❤️❤️❤️
I looooove Marina
THE MESSAGE THAT THESE LYRICS ARE SERVING RIGHT NOW !!
NO WAYYY OLD MARINA ENERGYYY
she can do no wrong
Love it
I love u Marina <3
Jesus Christ is Lord
*Greek™ twerking*
today's we didn't start the fire?
Marina is a godness 💚
can’t wait to listen to her future album
i love her so much
she is a queen
obsessed
Straight from Electra Heart and I love it.
Did she reference Rocky Horror Picture Show, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Wizard of Oz?
RADFEM ANTHEM "Do you really want me to write a feminist anthem?" Yes "I'm happy in the kitchen cooking dinner for my husband" Ok Marina, we'll pretend to believe it ^-^ Love youuuuuuu <3 much love from Brasil! Queen Marina
OMG
Did I cry? Absolutely YES
Weird energy. Too much irony, not really based on anything deep. Nay
the lyrics pls its the slap for me
She’s an icon
Her body is so perfect
Completely in love with this song, I love the ecofeminist message and the witchy vibe :3
Thank you Marina !
Sounds like if Sparks was commissioned to write a feminist “We didn’t start the fire.”  So, yeah, it’s catchy as hell.
Istg the more songs I listen to her the more pain I get when she slaps us with the truthfulness 🥴
sounds a litte bit like oh no
Muito boa
ninguém acima dela
This is WOW track! Respect from Russia.
No supero la canción 🤤
A R T
Britney twerking
Wow. Just gorgeous lyrics
𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙬𝙚𝙧𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜
This has been stuck in my head every since I've  heard it,  she rlly slayed 😫🤞🏼
Awesome song Marina!
“Capitalism made us poor” YES SISTER GO OFFFFFF
*twerks in NWO *
te amo
comrade marina
OMG, LISTEN AT 2X SPEED!! IT'S AMAZING!
Omg does she ever dissapoint? Another catchy song with again great lyrics and that melody!😍 For years I just can't stand the fact that she is so criminally underrated. People need to stop sleeping  on this popgodess!
Já fazem 3 dias e eu continuo aqui
Blessed be 🌒🌕🌘
MATOUUU ✨🛸✨
Alternative Marina is back!!! I missed these vibes so much!  Will the band also come back?
Mi nueva canción fav 😍💖😭💖✨
Like a modern B-52s! Very good!
*feminist twerking*
She's a diva, a perfectionist and likes to surprise her fanbase. Did not expect that in the slightest.
I love this so much!!!! Thank you for blessing my day...I love your music so much. ♥️ Witch support !!!

AAAHHH FAMILY JEWELS SHES BACK!! rock forever babyy
i love you
ELA VOLTOU E NEM AVISOU AAAAAAAA 😍😍
I love youuuu
She need more promotion of her artwork
OH GOD SHE SOUNDS LITERALLY LIKE SHE DID BACK IN THE DAYS AND THIS ALSO IS SO GOOD OH SHIT I- BFUVEWGHFWVFWGFEWHFCEGWCFEHWCFWCFHEWCFGECWFHCEWGFCECFGHEWCFGHEWCFHHGEWCFECWGHCFGHWCF
Dude! I'm just so shocked, I literally didn't think anyone could break her record, but she did it ! No words Going to replay and listen again😶👌😍
i hope people are actually listening to the lyrics
always amazing, love you marina 🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
Britney shaved her head for our sins
Alternative Marina is back 💜♀️
very much here for marina being overtly political tbh
i love the britney reference!! especially at a time where britney is battling the fight against her unfair coservatorship
im sure im going to love the new album because the sound of this song is so reminiscent of her first album UWU
Perfeita 😍, cadê os br🇧🇷 curte
OBSESSED
💕💕💕
"A New World Order", "A place so corrupt where Angel’s flesh and blood is sold", "All my friends are witches  And we live in Hollywood". Comments comments on this wall, are you paying any attention at all?
Loved
No me voy a morir- Belanova vibes
Goddess !!!!
This was shot at my brother in laws house 🎉
marina will always be the standard,  and if u think she's not, then pls raise ur standard!!!!
I get a feeling that she isnt one of the puppets like the current popstars
Those haunting notes! 😘😘😘
why do i think this is about bulimia
I love the fact that these lyrics are so punk and in-your-face. I feel like there are a lot of older songs that tried to convey the same message but in an elegant tone, with a lot of metaphors and poetry. This to me feels like a song made out of urgency, and frankly a "shit has hit the fan" attitude and I am SO here for it. I really went DAMN to so many lines. She just said it like it is, no more Miss Nice Marina! And the 80s darkwave undertones of the music support this attitude. Gothy, witchy, fuck the system vibes. Big YES!
a vida depois do love + fear
Ok I'm in love with this song
So addicting
SHE IS BACK FOR REAL NOW
So awesome! Definitely brings back the sound of Family Jewels. And those drums! YES.   Also, need a lyric video cos WHOA.
OMG 😮
Old Marina, new Marina... it's Marina <3
she is the main character
I lov marinas voice
Back on track, sounds great!
surprised no one in the comments (that I can see) has pointed out the explicitly anti-capitalist message of this song, as well as the more implicit message that it’s the main contributor to climate change. Not to mention the anti war message and the tie in of systemic racism and misogyny to capitalism. This is my favorite Marina song in years because of those things.
This is definitely a post-pandemic version of Set Fire to the World by billy joel
Essa mulher não erra, pelo contrário só acerta, que música contagiante! 🧡
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
THIS IS GORGEOUS
😍😍😍😍😍😍❤
This sounds like a sister of Hollywood, soo goood
I just know Lana and Melanie are part of that coven💅🖤
She looks like a Buffy villain I'm obsessed
detox twerking
ily
Can't wait for the Marina ft Jack Stauber collaboration
She looks like she had so much fun recording this 💕💕
She deserves a Grammy, hopefully next year they do something right by nominating her, it's waaay overdue
☠️🥰☠️🥰☠️
This is literally so addicting
uh this is real good <3 love the messages through this and Man's World, can't wait for an entire album of it :)
I WILL FOLLOW TO ALL YOUR TEACHINGS QUEEN
She is BACK
te amo siempre te ame
She's seriously speaking up like everyone should
this reminds so much of The Hex Girls
I just realised that in Man's World she says: "Burnt me at the stake, you thought I was a witch Centuries ago, now you just call me a bitch"  and in Purge The Poison: "All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood"  LOVE IT!
we need a MARINA AND RINA SAWAYAMA COLLAB!!! LETS GO. MARXIST QUEENS
oh my god, this is revolution
i love her oof
queen is back!!
Nice 👌
qq falta pra uma collab entre M.I.A e MARINA. Um sonho, um hino
New album on the same day as Troubled Paradise omg what a day for music!
eu te amo Deusa Marina eu te amo 🫀
I'm so excited for her new album
I hope she gets more views and subscribers. Her lyrics get straight to the point, none of that bs
Marina for unuversal president? I say yes!
Love u
Magic
I just want a world where i can see the feminine.
please stream purge the poison💖
THIS IS UNDERRATED
Please I love this song 😭😭
This is giving all the eras in one song , the goddess Marina didn’t deserve the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl0F875NU14
MYYY GIRLLLL😭😭😭😭😭💋
God. Most of my friends are witches and I may be moving to Ecuador. LA on the phone and since the ringing rings for evermore, I'll purge the poison from my core and broom the ill sounds out the door of consciousness, communal space, much info for the human race, retracing and erasing while our earthly stages spacing out and making out the fakers' clout and takers spout like a bows. Respect and honour to the sisterhood. Praise Pacha Mama.   I'm a trained actor with a Masters in poetry and if you hire me now, you get untold bonuses, including disaster prevention and diplomatic community 🤙🐻‍❄️🤙
WE NEED TO MAKE 1,000,000 BEFORE WEDNESDAY GUYS !!!
*anti-capitalist twerking*
SO FRESH I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!
Watching this over and over.
OLD MARINA’S VIBE YAAAAAY
A Queen♥
Petition to make this our National Anthem
no te merecemos reina tkm😔
YASSS MARINAS HAVING HER ACTIVIST, ARTIST AND WITCH ERA 💖💖💖
Love the visuals and the melody but the lyrics aren’t doing it for me I mean “capitalism made us poor” while it made marina wealthy.. yeah and some others don’t make sense
This song is politically correct 😄 Marina vibes again
producer: so how many visual effects would u like in the video? Marina: yes.
WHO'S HERE BEFORE 1 MILLION ?
MARINA didn’t start the fire
we didn’t start the fire but make it 2000s
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, my friend is dying over the song
Take the Gulag and shove it. If that is something you can't work out with your site, I'll listen when I want to. Maria seems to be teaching weird shit.
ecofascist qween
os visuais, a estética.... ela entregou tudo caras
SHES THE MOMENT YALL
I love this whole "Kill all men" era omg
SHES BACKKKKK
Ok purr
CDMX, MÉXICO PRESENTE 🤗
Purge Liberalism (I mean Communism). Sadly, won't happen.
Market in America gdammit!!
FUCK ReAlItyyyy teehee
YES YES YES
perfectttttttt
I'm happy that she's back to her roots and where she belongs!
I instantly knew this was going to be a bop before I even clicked on it
She's a star, she's powerful and I love her so much!
This reminds me so much of OH NO!
Dude she low-key defended lana del rey after the shit year she had with controversies.
I'm getting so many gifts this week, now classic Marina is back  😭
It's like she aging backwards she looks ethereal and the music omggggggg my ears are blessed
I looooooooooooooooveeeee thiiiiisssssssssss
Marina! Myself and 47 diamonds from across the world came together to create a fan lyric video for “Purge The Poison” you can watch it right here on our Youtube channel! 🙊💖 We hope you like it!
AMAZING!
I just have to mention how amazing the mention of witches was in this👐 so powerful! And the aesthetic is so reminiscent of Electra heart it fills me with so much happiness. Stand in your feminine power✨🎇🎆🌌🌚🔮🔱
This has a We Didn't Start the Fire vibe
I'm here before 1M.
ICONIC
MY FAVOURITE IS BACK
SHES BACK!!! FINALLY
I can't even express how perfect this song is. She did it again.
Te amo.
It's the old marina's sound with the new marina's lyrics and im obsessed
She really said Free Britney
MARINA WENT FULL ANTICAPITALIST WE LOVE TO SEE IT
Goal. Meet this woman once in my life, just so I can tell her how amazing she is to her face.
SHE'S BACK BITCHES
your save my night, thnks
Well this is just woke intersectional feminist propaganda set to music. 🤮
a marina song that sounds like marina
perfect perfect PERFECT!!!!!!!!✨✨✨💖
The production is excellent and the vocals are there! However the lyrics are just. They're trying to hard, there's no poetry
SHES BACK BABYYYYYY
inspiration in grace jones? Love much
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I LOVE THIS AAAA
<3 Waiting for that Marina album
I hope people understand her message
this is giving me past era flashbacks
❤️🥂
te amooo
We Stan a 👸 who talks about things that are actually important in this world
Love this 💙💙💙
I love her and God i love this song 😍😍
Love u forever
místicas perras, i love it
watching this every day to give it the views it deservessss
Family Jewels meets actual Marina, love it Also the social content
Me at every stop light “2007 when size 0 was the rage, Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her craze”
Strong TFJ sound from this, I love it.
I love the natural development from pop princess to iconic witch that Marina had over the years; her music it's like a balm to that part of me that is a little disappoint by society ♡
This gives me We Didn't Start The Fire vibes
Queen
She is so stunning with her hair pulled back
Que bonito homenaje a Natalia Oreiro.
Grunge look with green dress-tfj era Blonde girl with wizard of oz red shoes-electra heart era Green and purple suit-froot era  Hair slicked back in water-l+f era
Perfect Lopping 💞
I need Marina’s arm workout ASAP
Yep
LOVE IT
I love Marina,  but I really disagree that Capitalism made us poor? If we weren’t a Capitalistic society Marina wouldn’t be making money which enables her to share her beautiful voice. I’d love to hear others feedback on this. 💕
ARTEEEE
Valley of the Dolls 🤣
OLD MARINA IS BACK!!!!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
when she said capitalism made us poor..
This sounds like family jewels, but the video is bad, I don’t know what’s happening to her, her first two eras she made really good and original videos, her last album was really good but really bad videos, I think this is one of the reason she’s not getting the success she deserves, she needs to put more effort in her videos to be at the same level of her music
WOOOOOO YEAHHHHHH
OMG wow, i wasn't expecting this to slay me so much...Fully giving me old Marina style..
I can’t believe there are still people who dose not know this legend like wtf are you even living???
I can’t get a enough of this its so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song slaps so hard
Another unbelievably incredibly amazing song by Marina
Y E S ! THIS IS OUR GODDESSS
A R T E
keep streaming sisters ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
I am a wizard
She’s always so sexy.
the video has rlly strong the family jewels vibes!!! the song is so old marina too, i love it
me: oh new marina song.. lets check it out 2 seconds in: *already loving it*
I LOVE IT
I feel like it is mother earth speaking to us through her prophet named Marina. MARINA YOU ARE ROCKING IT
MARINAAA witches ain’t it 😭 but ily still

LOS DODORINOS ESTAMOS COLAPSANDO DE TREMENDO ARTE <3
QUE DIOSA HA REGRESADO MARINA
felt like old marina, 10/10  but i feel bad for thinking that because i know any artist wants to do other shit
Oh??????????
love the start so much, sounds like an anime or something haha
There is no place left home
Musically like good ol' times, but lyrically too PC and one dimensional. It might grow on me like most of her stuff though. I consider her a genius so don't think I'm not a fan.
GORGEOUS
YES
old vibes 🔝🙌 I love it ✨✨
healingly twerking
This song is fucking perfect! 💜
OMG I MISSED THE OLD MARINA AHHHHH!!!!
This makes me so happy
She’s just a goddess
Excuse me, are those red gloves Zella Day?!?!??! 0:25 My Game????
Marina has ne music, nature is healing
ELECTRA HEART VIBES I'M IN LOVEEEEE
I'm a witch
i love you Marina ❤
BEAUTIFULL I LOVED, KISSES FROM BRAZIL, I LOVE THIS SONG!  SORRY MY ENGLISH!
Great track and video. Kinda reminds me of "Are you satisfied?" but in a saving the world kind of context.
Wow
ITS GIVING FAMILY JEWELS I LOVEEEEE IT
Abertura de I-carly? 😂♥️
I'm not obssessed because "old marina vibes". I'm OBSSESSED because it's Marina, and her work always worth it!!
beautiful girl with gorgeous vocals!
Damn...🔥
1 MILHÃO
Marina te amo, eres el amor de mi vida.
I love how openly political, feminist, socioeconomically and environmentally conscious she is in her music now! She's definitely starting a new trend that we need more of!
queen
the beauty and the talent!! i cannot
i thought this was one of the older songs from her that i missed !!! lol
MGMT vibes.
you know it's gonna be good when you're only a second in and it's already a banger
MARINA SAVED 2021 WE WIN❗️❗️
a return to form after the terrible "love + fear".
This is not watchable and not listenable. I miss the old Marina, you had hope then in an angsty way and now you are just angry. Pray for God to show you his ways and what true spiritual regeneration is. Renounce witchcraft and earth worship. John 3:8 The LORD bless you and keep you, Marina, show you the truth.
Why the fuck baby reveal party in trending but not this masterpiece
she really said woman rights are human rights
This looks like something that played on a music video channel between the late 80s and the early 90s
Magnificent Marina🖤💜💚 I love this song
боже это как эра электрик харт!!! обожаю оолд Марину!!!
Pls she doesn’t age Im sooo jealous 😭😭
Fuck! My heart is exploding!!! 2021 needed this. Thanks Marina for making my day my week and my year :)
#FreeBritney ❤
Marina is so underrated  Her creativity is amazing and so is her kindness
Old Marina vibes! I love it
why is she so amazing
Really good Marina! Its still you! Respect👍🍀
I love the visual aesthetic. Love the rhythm and melody of the song. Love how the lyrics are genuinely meaningful and important.   Marina is so talented!

I also just want to see the feminine 😭!! Love this because it’s so true! So often, the feminine energy is seen as weak, when that’s not the case at all. One day, it’ll be more respected

Ya estarás contentas Lesslie del Rey
PLSS QUEEN BACK
OLD MARINA OMFGGGG!!!!!
WTF? Why people hates this lyric? This one of her BEST lyric in a whole career, really smart
I love your creations Marina, I'm with you for so many years..  But I dont like that it is more and more political each time.  meh
I’m living for this!!! Everything!! The music! The lyrics! Her outfit!!
I am obsessed!!!!
She makes politics sound good, okay we can all stan, but I miss the Teen idle vibes...
Marina is finally back.... the marina I've been waiting for for a very very long time, old memories resurfaced....I love her <3
no one is doing it like she is
Since the Man's World song i realized that in my own opinion - all Marina's way in Music is completely piece of shit. Build up idea is her traumatised ego - she put it literally everywhere. And open people's eyes on their problems - feels like fashionable "hype mod engage" similar to gay rights protection. Sorry to everyone - its just me. Give you advice don't lisen shit like Marina, enjoy pure old trance Music or Nu Disco or somethin. Peace.
Obsessed with everything about this
😭😭😭 loooveee
This era is giving us such amazing records 🥰🥰🥰
she SNAPPED
"Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazy" WOW WHAT
MARINA IS IT
AMAZING! love ❤️
Legend
Queen
I love this, but where are The Diamonds?
She is really channeling her inner Kate Bush here huh w/ 80s aesthetic
EXTREMAMENTE LENDÁRIA

I love this new song! I adore it! OMG! 😩❤️✨🌸  Lots of love from Germany 🇩🇪 🇪🇺

This woman is unstoppable, I’m loving how she’s able to create genuinely amazing art promoting social issues. She’s what the world needs💕
*earthly twerking*
* twerks in poison *
Hail to the Queen. Love this ❤️
omg, i feel nostalgic to her froot era but we're like moving forward 🥺🥰❤️💗💖
this is about to become my entire personality oh my god
The family jewels vibeeeeees
Humanism and Feminism.... that's the beauty in its pristine glorious state. Such a wonderful MARINA
👍👏👌♥️
This sounds like it came straight out of "The Family Jewels", Marina is going back to her roots! ✨
Hollywood and To be human lovechild
My head stopped for a bit m speechless rn I believe in marina since her first album even if she's not well known in worldwide but that's because she's not doing bullshit or commercials she brings meaning in every single word she says
WE WENT BACK TO OUR ORIGINS OMG YASSSS
Love the lyrics and I see nobody else doing what she is doing. Respect to her for making meaningful music!
How is Marina's lyrics always so on point relevant and corresponding to what I am going through! Where are my witch sisters at? 🔮
QUEEN
Marina is back to Electra ❤💙💜
OLD MARINA IS BACK?!
OLD MARINA VIBES AND IM HERE FOR IT
Ваще классная ..
Q U E E N .
Why does Marina remind me so much of Phoebe from Friends?
this is giving me marina and the diamonds YES
Her Music is the Best <3
SO TRUE MARINA QUEEN
Can't believe Marina invented purging. I'm obsessed your honour.
weeell...hail the new queen
The fact that i have bul!imia makes the name 10000x better
ELECTRA HEART AND FROOT ERA COMBINED AHHH 💞✨
I like the song, the video. Glad to see that Marina, like many years ago. I would very much like to have a collector's edition on cd / vinyl (in my collection from Marina, whom I constantly listen to). But the cost is ridiculous! Marina sings about inequality, but a lot of fans around the world are exposed to inequality thanks to such delivery exclusives. PRE-ORDER/ PRE-SAVE: ... Subtotal	€31.99 Shipping & Handling (Tracked Mail)	€58.48 Grand Total	€90.47   "Capitalism made us poor" or its because i'm russian? Sorry about that, but.. uh
marina we are on the same team!!!
Yessss Marina
She read America to filth 😍
all her songs sound the same 😩 where’s the artistic evolution girl
Marina! She is back! <3 ( she never went no where^^,)
THIS SHIT IS FYRE!!! LOVE EVERY BITS OF LINE
Marina t amo nunca t mueras
I'm loving it! It's giving old Marina vibes, a huge contrast toward her previous album.
OMG! This album is coming out on my Birthday! What a freaking gift! Dont know what I would do without you QUEEN!
We love Family Jewels 2.0
the eco-feminist rebrand we needed!
I LOVE THE VIBES IT SOUNDS SO GOOD

I’m obsessed 😍 with this mystical song
I just can't understand why her label always put a 2 dollars budget into this genious woman. She need much promo, lives, better videos etc always needed! Bigger than this, wtf I mean imagine this artist with much more promo! She always have something to say Im OBSESSED to see her bigger!

EU AMO ESSA MULHER
Alt/Indie twerking
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
💙
My favourite new hook I’ve heard in a long time!!! So catchy!!! I can’t wait for your new album marina 💛💚💙
Can I somehow be a part of this sisterhood of mystical bitches. Please? Please please please
thumbs up if you're playing on repeat
"I'm tryna look for the lyrics in the comments but all i see is a variety of amateur twerkers...I applaud you all.
Look, I'm a fan of Marina and I love and listen to all the songs she has released so far, but I couldn't match this song to her. This song doesn't suit her and it's not a song that I can call good at all, unfortunately. I am saying it again, my purpose is not to lynch her or anything, I just politely explain my opinion. Come on, you can't say this song is bad just because you are all her fans. Everyone, it's not a bad thing, we don't have to call every song beautiful just because we're fans of her. Let's be honest and say what's real on our minds and Marina will agree. I'm also a fan of her but I didn't like this song. This is fckin normal, not everyone will always release perfect songs. I can also say that the songs "Handmade Heaven", "Soft to Be Strong", "Baby", "End Of The Earth", "To Be Human", "Enjoy Your Life" are also perfectly beautiful songs. Just as I can tell this song is bad. Anyway guys, I'll be just waiting for the album, I hope there are better songs in the album. I have expectations from Marina. Her voice is tremendous. 🤍🖤
Remember when I saw the cover for 'Mermaid VS. Sailor,' heard her singing about the devil and called her out for being a witch and nobody believed me. Lana too. Called her out for being a witch way before the public knew. Everyone called me crazy. Witchcraft is extremely powerful; It will literally consume you and make you believe you're helping the world. You're not. You are the reason we are in this state that we are and we are only a short time away until the Mark of the Beast, a cryptocurrency that will connect your brain and your hand (Rev 16:9) You will not be able to buy or sell until you take this mark. Homosexuality isn't real. Sex with women is amazing. For all. We have all been lied to. Do NOT join her 666 sisterhood ESPECIALLY if you are a man. Trust in God. Trust in Jesus. Please do not hesitate to challenge this.
MARINA TE AMO, GRACIAS POR ESTE TEMAZO
OMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.
She is anti-capitalist! 💖 Hopefully she’s Marxist too but I’ll get behind anti-capitalist lmao
o murro em man’s world
What a fucking icon, what truth x
She really said you know what imma just : *is iconic and witchy*
Before this song I said if I hear the word quarantine again I’m going to scream, after I AM SCREAMING YASSS. Marina slayed yet again!
marxina diamandis
*Genius!*
This makes me feel nostalgic
Why is she literally the most perfect human being?!
PERFEITA
Album out on my bday 🥺😩😖😣
"God forgive América for every single war, *crying in mexican* ಥ‿ಥ For those who do not understand: The US intervention in Mexico, also called the Mexican-American War or La guerra Mexico-Estadounidense (Mexican-American War, in English),was a military conflict that confronted México with the United States between the years 1846 and 1848. It began as a result of the expansionist claims of the United States, whose first step was the creation of the Republic of Texas, which separated from the Mexican state of Coahuila and Texas, Other triggers were the entry of the US Army into the area, as a result Mexico lost 1/3 of its territory
Froot 2.0
Old Marina is back! Kinda reminded me with 80's froot era mix with jewels family 💃🏽
The best thing I've listened to recently. 👏🏻👏🏻
Family Jewels, but make it woke 👏 I love this
Marina and qveen herby collab pls 🥺🧚‍♀️
Lets make this our generations anthem
prettysoundsprettysoundsprettysound
You look like jolyne Cujoh with the green outfit
Im here to hear her saying Britney
I feel like I've already heard this before
I love you marina <3
So really a full on feminist now. :/ A bit obnoxious, but I still love you.
Love the reference to Britney! And it's true, everybody calls her crazy, and now look at us, we all making our hell in this planet, destroying it, I know that feeling its terrible, the feel of being powerless about saving our planet, consuming it all.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS
i love the way she reflects social problems in her songs, no one is doing it like Marina
i love this
Sosossososossooooo obsessed with this!!!!!!! You have such a power when you sing. ♡
my queeeeeeen 😍❤❤❤
these looks !!!!! 💚💜 gorgeous !!
So many words to describe her, and yet I am speechless. My QUEEN! <3 Marina....
OMG. The music. The lyrics. The meaning. The voice. I have fallen in love.
That drum intro sounds like We Got the Beat from the Go Gos
MARINA! ❤️
Marina te amo por ti le echo ganas al colegio

Can't wait for the album!!! 💜
rocky horror picture show vibes with the talking lips
A bop
Woke women❤👏🙌 Love your music and lyrics Marina❤🙌👏💪🏽

old marina vibes with such an important message
i want to live in this music video forever
O Brasil te ama Mulher 🇧🇷❤️
Brazilian people?😃🤩
TE AMO
Old marina is back and i loved it
Wait.. you all fell for this bullshit political cringeworthy white skinny lady branding? Shit, I’m even more depressed now.
This song has such a deep meaning i realized it when she said its a new world order
Menuda fan ta sí a. 🌟
No because I’m obsessed
Just become a communist, Marina. We have cookies.
aaaaa she is back <3
DIOSA
I’m a a huge admirer of all of Marina’s Work and her in general really, I love  how her themes all tie, reinforce each other and ultimately lead to deeper meaning.  I was belting it out at home tonight and honestly felt some Queen/Mercury coming through- ? The reverb, the Tempo change, the lyrics are faster and hard hitting, with meaning and just screaming relevance.  Singing from another’s point of view etc.  Masterpiece level Marina. 💎💯
Te amo, gracias.
MARINA SNAPPED!!!! as a long term fan I'm proud of her growth and her signature cheeky, camp style. I'm honestly emotional :''')
If lana del rey is Sartre, Marinna is Camus
SO GOOD
Pleaseee come to Curitiba in Brazil, we love u ❤️❤️❤️
Marina has such a unique voice with great talent. It allways makes me happy when I hear this Lamborghini Diamont voice :);).
Amazing song, as always. Marina deserves more views...
Please go on diva and don't forget about your diamonds
thank god she's back to her roots, rip marina's radio music era you won't be missed!
The world should listen to this song immediately! We need it! Bravo, Marina!
MARINA IM OBESE
Magnífico. Marina eres la reina 👑
Best woman artist of The world👍👍👍
I LOVE it!!!! Reminds me of her older stuff! YAS!

Back to the past song...hmmm. I'm confused
queen is back.
I really want to like this, but it’s so on the nose and specifically political that it makes me cringe. Like, this song is gonna be so dated in a year it’s not even funny
Bubblegum bit 9 years later 💁🏼‍♀️💅🏼
"Who do u think you are"Thiss!!Baddie,wow
Love u x This is so lovely...the lyrics
570 dislikes are only mad she's calling them out like that
she literally never disappoints
Several North Americans furious to hear the truth... 😂😂😂😂MARINA IS PERFECT! Samba mais na cara desses hipócritas que a gente ama 🧡💛💚La verdad molesta a los falsos.

Futurista
Omygosh, she looks so much like Natalia Oreiro on this cover!
Vibes from the old songs, i love it!
Te amo , chiquita
0:16  Am I the only one who thinks that with this hair tied like that she's looking like Musa from Winx Saga? 😂
if someone would have told me this was released 4 years ago i wouldn’t even doubt it
Marina with brown dress and loose hair: The Family Jewels Marina's mouth alone: Electra Heart Marina with yellow clothes and tied hair: Froot Marina in the pool: Love+Fear  Let me believe in my fantasy 😩

This deserves more views!!! Please share
"Capitalism made us poor" says the woman who became rich thanks to capitalism. I love Marina and her music, but these recent poilitical lyrics are pretty cringe and tryhard. It's a shame cause the songs melody slaps. I'm still singing along to these lyrics.
We love a witchy anti capitalist anti misogyny anti racism bop
Like a GODDESSS✨✨
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ FIZ MEU CANAL A POUCO TEMPO, VENHA CONHECER E JOGAR TARÔ COMIGO ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

♡♡♡♡♡♡
I made up a whole story, thank you Marina!! Set in the 80s (rise of feminism), it's about two witches gfs who kill men bc of their past trauma in a hideout in the woods <3 I won't spoil you the end♡

Lyrics:  [Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood Whilst society is fallin', we are quietly reformin' Protectin' the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined, all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget, I am your home Virus come, fires burn, until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007, when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein gone to jail⁣⁣⁣, Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣, the ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus] It's a New World Order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate, we can now regenerate Stop how we'd been livin' every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are?

[Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell, cast the moon under our spell Ownin' female power, takin' back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus] Earth is like a white rose, quiet cloud of petals cold A place so corrupt where angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new, studded with a diamond dew Saw the dawn was comin', everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are?

Yeeeeees!!! SHE ISSSS! Amazing!!!
El petardeo que llevábamos años pidíendole

Witch Marina !!!! <3
She is a super talented song writer, her messages are important and she does it so well, thanks Marinão 💞💕😚
Love u so much <3
Come to Portugal please and this time Lisbon, not Porto haha
Love you, Marina! ⚘
It was MARINA ALL ALONG!!  Gurl I'm so proud 💚💜
Marina ate this up and left no crumbs ✨
you will not exist marina if america does not go to war
Love it!!!!
You said tell me who you are well my name is Marina and we are opposites. I believe in female leaders because their qualified not because of gender. Capitalism didn’t make us poor and you don’t live in the real world. The difference between liberals like you and me is that you can shout all you want but I believe in freedom of speech above all because I am American and I will never tell the opposition to shut up. Communists will delete this post and “ purge the poison” which is basically getting rid of freedom of thought which is not yours.
Marina puso todos los problemas del mundo en una canción , y le dió espacio para hacer su coro largo. La amoooooo 💜💛🧡❤️💚🎵🌟
next time i see anyone clap i’m gonna be like “FUCK YEAH, PURGE THE POISON” 👏🏼👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
I love you my queen, please come to Mexico someday surely!

She is GORGEOUS.
I've missed you
this song gives me 'sex yeah' vibe from the Electra Heart
I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU ! With love x
Marina makes a lot of references to spirituality in her latest songs. Interesting
Δια τούτο σας καλώ να αναφώνησετε. Ζητώ η Μαρίνα.
Ahhhhh this is giving me classic marina i love it so much
Marina is a role model
bendecidas por MARINA una vez más <3
she is sooo iconic, inspirational and empowering
We're blessed with this song. This new era will be fire💕👏🏼😍
MARINA I LOVE YOU
**twerking to everyone's comments about twerking **
In this video She’s representing mother nature! Purge The Poison!
Marina is so underrated ,she is literally a queen ,a true artist ,a role model !
queen
YES OLD MARINA VIBES IM OBSESSED
Finally sounds like the Marina we’ve been missing since Electra Heart, the problem is the song still sounds tame and dull like everything since Froot... Hopefully the rest of the album is punchier and more catchy. Maybe if she stopped living the Hollywood life she always craved her music would sound real and honest again, because since Froot it’s all sounded pretty soulless.  I don’t expect the majority of you to agree with this of course, because most of you became fans after Electra Heart’s success,  and enjoy the soulless pop music that’s fed to you over and over again by the same female artists that lost what made them special after an album or two.
INCREDIBLE OMGGGGG
Where did u lose your diamonds?
Guys! We're almost at 500k views!
GO WUEEN GO
she said i’m gonna give the gays everything they want
i just realized the video's aspect ratio is 3:4 which is so weird to see now when everyone is trying to get a wider screen in media.
Speaking right to my soul. Thanks for finally getting me!!! I love you forever.
This is so TFJ
Marina hates the society we live in. Finally a relatable star.
Thank you for healing the planet 🌍 mother 👑
The nerve of you to release 2 bangers which we all connect with not just superficially (aesthetic, lovely voice as usual) but profoundly (lyrics, message)........... I really wouldn't put it past you to save the Earth wow
The Political Pop we needed
this is TRANSCENDANT this is a MANIFESTO
This is everything I ever wanted! Thank you so much Marina 💚✨🪄
I seriously love MARINA so much!!! Simply amazing!!!
Intense Envy for her Outfits
💜🇧🇷
💟💟💟💟💟
Finally we get an album for the fems

#purgethepoison

CAPITALISM MADE US POOR!
* poisonous twerking *
I LOVE YOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU
Awesome
Next time I want to explain my sexuality to someone I think I'm just going to show them this video
A lot of people don't understand that global warming LITERALLY is the earth trying to purge itself of us, mother nature don't give af, she's just trying to go back to normal
Family jewels vibes in the best way 💖
LYRICS if you prefer comments All my friends are witches And we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches Making our own sisterhood Whilst society is falling We are quietly reforming Protecting the planet Healing our own damage  Quarantined, all alone Mother nature on the phone What have you been doing? Don’t forget, I am your home Virus come, fires burn Until human beings learn From every disaster You are not my master  Need to purge the poison Show us our humanity All the bad and good Racism and misogyny Nothing’s hidden anymore Capitalism made us poor God forgive America For every single war  Need to purge the poison From my system until Human beings listen Tell me, who’d you think are? It’s your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me You won’t go far  2007, when size zero was the rage Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail, @/metoo​ helped us to unveil Truth and all its glory The ending of a story  It’s a New World Order Everything just falls away Our life as we knew it Now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and the hate We can all regenerate Stop how we been living Every single day  Need to purge the poison From my system until Human beings listen Tell me, who’d you think are? It’s your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me You won’t go far  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning our power Taking back what’s ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals cold A place so corrupt where Angel’s flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Studded with a diamond dew Saw the dawn was coming Everybody knew  Need to purge the poison From my system until Human beings listen Tell me, who’d you think are? It’s your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me You won’t go far  Need to purge the poison From my system until Human beings listen Tell me, who’d you think are? It’s your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me You won’t go far (also i write songs inspired by Jeremy Zucker/Lauv. I'd love if you give a shot to my music and subscribe 'cause most probably you won't regret<3have a good day:)
i love the concept of her being a popstar, activist, and witch at the same time
I swear I heard this somewhere before release and I didn't see the leak but it's the part where she is saying we need to purge the poison fast
Aiii essa vibe ai q saudds 🤧💖
Please come back to Cleveland so I can meet you again
When I say something’s breathtaking at this point, I literally refer to being as breathtaking as this era. Like fr
i love how Marina this sounds! it’s very much her style but it’s so fresh and new at the same time. an amazing era is coming, i can feel it
Though song is contradictory...It deserves a like for the truth,though I do not support witches.
the 462 dislikes were the mysogonistic racists
queen
But I'm against a New World Order.I do not like it at all.
Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail... and Katy Perry was a bait.
A place so corrupt where Angel’s flesh and blood is sold... Yes it's truly is so.
this sound is SO reminiscent of the family jewels, i love this so much.
The live chat would went to the rhythm a lot
In 2007 Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed...
Purge the poison from your system...I Have seen Horns of Baphomet and some Illuminati signs.
God forgive America for ever single war... Yes they have fought many unfair wars.
All the sisters witches... I know one Tiniest Witch in Hollywood with baby face it's a Tiny Persilla:):):).
This song has a complicated text.Let's figure it out.
savages part 3
Me encanta
Savages part 2 and I am here for it.
Marina is now the only valid depiction of Mother Nature.
Acabo de descobrir o quebrando tabu
The red latex gloves are killing it here
Casi llegamos al medio millón. VAMOOOOOOOS.

YES 👏🏻
Capitalism surely made ME poor
It's crazy what a genius Marina is when it comes to writing. She's one of the very few artists that write about reality in such a philosophical way. We share the same views on way too many topics but I struggle to put then into words, yet M always does it so beautifully and gracefully. Effortless good lyrical action here, beautiful notes that only a music student would consider singing, love her face in the yellowish-green outfit, she looks as excited and proud as we are. I love you Marina, girl you're my favorite human being, would love it if you go back to writing, I tend to find myself interested in whatever is in this pretty little mind of yours. You're a genius, musical genius, writing genius, but also a human-genius like nobody else.
It seems that she has real fun with her music again! I love it!
I can't express enough how much I love this. I simply can't.
So beautiful!!
#freebritney ❤️
*psychedelic twerking*
The new and improved “We Didn’t Start the Fire”
te amo tanto marina
I love you please come to egypt one day
♡art
I love how Marina embraces her femininity. I feel like as a woman living in this century,  as we become more empowered, somehow femininity as been related to something shameful. I know it is mostly a social construct but still is somehow part of who we are and i don't think it is something we should feel embarrased about.

This is Mega Ultra Supra

my Marina i can’t describe how much you mean to me ilysm, i want to cry😭😭💕
1:54 smile
awesum
* some kind of twerking just to fit in *
Queen you are the best person  in the industry
It’s like she just lives inside my brain and makes this beautiful art verbalizing it all through song.

i love ittt
PERFECT! <3
Dang, this sh*t is scary!
It's like We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel, but nicer
We Didn't Start the Fire, Marina version
You never dissapoint me girl  i love you
I remember discovering Marina in middle school. I just graduated recently and I am still a fan 😌👏🏽💗
Queen baby
The lyrics are so powerful and so true. ✨💞
I'm obsessed! I always love your music
This song reminds me of a Sky Ferreira song, I can't recall the name now...
this song is fun
That’s music healing me i feel I’m back to 2014 literally MARINA Adorable unmatched !
Reminds me of family jewels but even better
After the second time listening to this. I just realized that this is Marina's modern version of Billy Joel's "We didn't start the fire" And I'm REALLY obsessed with tht.
Damn that sounds like ''needle push the poison'' both scary and genius
Really really proud of you marina you never dissapoint and this song was amazing!
Why nobody is talking about the wizard of Oz references?  That's so cool!
I mean, there’s no other artist that write their lyrics like Marina does and that’s why I love her. Her songs always reflect social issues and not always just about boys love and sex.
I LOVE YOU MARINA
Te amo marina 💖💖💖💖💖
Marina is everything we need right now--someone with influence and artistic prowess speaking out about real world problems through their art! It's amazing how much is said through her lyrics alone. She's such an inspiration and I love the direction this album is headed.
This song is a real gem 💎
Marina is sooo talented
As someone who’s a fan of Marina from pre album MySpace days this album is going back to her roots and I am so here for it ! Giving the gays what they need !
So goooood
My new favorite Marina song. She never ceases to amaze.
OH NO! TFJ blueprint is strooongg! 💎💎💎💎😍😍😍
I want to be friends with her
ARTEEEEE
Love it ❤️
I'm so ready for this new album and era
This video has such an alt-90’s vibe and I am LIVING FOR IT

If you listen closely you can hear all the drag queens practicing lip syncing to this so they can be the first queen in their city to claim the song
drugs? nah ive got purge the poison
ethereal chaos
LITERALLY A MERMAID
I loved Love + Fear and Froot but the beats and tones of an Electra Heart era is my absolute favorite and this gives me those same vibes 💗
i’m in love w those vocals omfgg
#freebritney
We need more artists who just say it like it fucking is, like Marina
This is giving me SUCH family jewels vibes and YESSSSSSSSSS
MARINA,MARINA!!!!!!!
I AM LITERALLY OBSESSED
Marina swoops in to save 2021!
I love this song so much, but I can't understand "god forgive america for every single war" Is she refering to The United States of America? Or America as a whole?
communist icon you should do a revolution and all the gays will follow you
it sounds like marina with mgmt influence
so beautiful
Something in her voice that free my endorphins !!! Love her forever
I loved this in so many ways, I can't 😩❤️
#FreeBritney
This song has similar vibes to “we didn’t start the fire” and I love that
tudooooooooo
This gives mad solitaire vibes. And it also is very reminiscent of her older songs. I’m loving this!! And the lyrics are so meaningful. Great. Work marina!
Marina is so underrated and needs to be recognized Like if u agree——->
Hey, I'm so happy for this new record but i didn't see Happy Loner :(
#FreeBritney
i've got termites
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
loving the song but near the end around 2:29 the lyrics in the discription say "Owning  our power" while "Owning female power" is what is sung, does that mean that this line will be different on the album? Or just a mistake while making the discription.    This song was excactly what i just needed. the message is timely while the music is just beautiful and entrancing. Cant wait for the album
THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME TV SHOW INTRO BUT I CAN'T CATCH WHICH ONE
I love this song i can't wait for the album
I love everything abt u I can’t even relate in words!
Communist baddie 😘😘💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻#girlboss

this is literally WE DIDNT START THE FIRE. Billy Joel walked so MARINA COULD FUCKIN RUN

Come to Spain love✨✨✨✨
The queen of the electro-indie is back ✨✨🧚 🧚 🍃💖
The melody reminds me of a good Sparks song (70s rock band from Germany)
I love how she is exploring new music genres and still having music, politics, and feminism all into one.
Congratulations, excellent song✨
I love it

She is amazing with the messages she has in her songs while still being a killer song. She has been my favorite artist and always will be !
#freebritney
Been a fan since the start, she doesn't have a single bad album. This song sounds like something from 'The Family Jewels' which is great.
this is just what we needed
so true queen ended misogyny and capitalism
Love it! Yes!
#FreeBritney and save us the fucking WORLD! 🙌

Sounds like Marina's beginnings. Love it!
EVERYONE MARINA’S READING THE COMMENTS OMFG?
Ya no esta en tendencias ya estaras contenta lesslie del rey
I've been her since like 2015 and not once have you ever disappointed me, like why is lit all of your music amazing, its actually crazy, bless this women she's actually god.
favorite musical genre: powerful women angry
Wow!
Yeaaah old Marina vibes love it
The lyrics is strong and inspiring to reflect on life ....serious message ❤️
songs are so much better when they're making fun of men and america
Marina: do you really want me to write a feminist anthem also Marina: yes.
anti-capitalism........... i think i've seen this film before
que mulher perfeita! eu to de queixo caído om tanta beleza. Eu te amo tanto, Marina <3
ON REPLAY ALL DAY, I LOVE IT, ITS BRILLIANT but damn its baaaad isn’t it?
i don’t understand how she can say “capitalism made us poor”, when she used the capitalist system is what allowed her to become rich off her incredible talent and competence as an artist. it feels dishonest and graft-y on quite a few levels. and the thing about only one quarter of the government being female doesn’t sit with me quite right either. women have entirely equal opportunity to become politicians in the united states, just look at people like AOC, if a woman can get into a position like that, i’m not really seeing the problem. the reason that fewer women are in government is generally a lack of interest, it’s not a product of some patriarchal oppressive device. the same exact concept applies why there are fewer male teacher’s or nurses. men and women are just commonly interested in different things.
Who else thought she said bitch instead of but for the following line “but your home is now your prison”?
Im so in love 💗 ahshhhs
you ate that bestie
one of her best songs omg i love the vibes ive been streaming non stop it's just so good 😭😭💚💚
She is an ace of music I like her
MARINA ISN'T JUST A STAR. SHE’S THE BRIGHTEST STAR THAT LIGHTS UP THE UNIVERSE. THE BADDEST WOMAN THAT HAS EVER WALKED ON EARTH SHE’S ON HER OWN LEAGUE SHE DIDNT COME TO TAKE PART SHE CAME TO TAKE OVER. SHE IS MARINA REMEMBER HER NAME. MARINA THE BEST!
this could easily be a system of a down song
Icon

“Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣” , the truth has been spoken
I’M HERE FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CLIP

LYRICS  All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood Whilst society is fallin', we are quietly reformin' Protectin' the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined, all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget, I am your home Virus come, fires burn, until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? 2007, when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein gone to jail⁣⁣⁣, Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣, the ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus] It's a New World Order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate, we can now regenerate Stop how we'd been livin' every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are?  [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell, cast the moon under our spell Ownin' female power, takin' back what's ours Pre-Chorus] Earth is like a white rose, quiet cloud of petals cold A place so corrupt where angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new, studded with a diamond dew Saw the dawn was comin', everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far Need to purge the poison from our system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far

QUEEN
THE TALENT
do nada isso na minha pagina inicial
Queen shit
TFJ + FROOT = NEW ERA VISUALS
I like 'Karma' and the older stuff from when she was known as Marina and the Diamonds, listened to it for years since before she got this popular but the direction her music has gone most recently is almost disappointing. It's too blatant activist/ideological and less original (or plain good) in sound. This is exactly why fans of indie/alternative artists worry about them getting world famous, the quality suffers and they just become mainstream propaganda machines like all the rest.
A ver si encuentro un comentario de TopMusicOff jaj
Lyrics are kinda bleh, but the song overall is pretty great for dancing \o /
venceu mamãe, você sabe que venceu!!
Perfection.
Yes Marina, without you I really won't go far thanks for everything ❤

I've been a fan *Diamond* for almost a decade now and I've been saying it the whole time...she is brilliant and she is underrated. I love everything about her artistry...but her lyrics especially, are just always on point.
I've been a fan of your voice and your lyrics, ever since Primadonna Girl. I love your musical attitude, I think you're heavily underrated and I don't see why popularity doesn't rank you beside Dua Lipa. Quality and musicality isn't what's valued in music these days. Can't wait for the new album!

best of all
precious

que musica boa to aqui repetindo pela 1000x
queen
I'm so obsessed with this song. I love the TFJ and Froot vibes in this, and the song sounds like it could fit on Electra Heart or TFJ. It could fit in Froot too tbh. It's so good I'm obsessed
Social reform KWEEN
Sayyyy iiit tata
Iconic all that u have cannot be bought by money
I feel like I'm 15 again i stg the nostalgia
I had to think about "Oh No" after this video because the line "capitalism made us poor" reminded of her in the dollar bill dress with money raining onto her in "Oh No". That song in general, while seeming so happy, is pretty dark, especially considering her state of mind during the whole Family Jewels Era, as many others have pointed out. And I feel like the line in Purge the Poison describes this song pretty well! As far as I remember, from what I've read at the time Marina was out for success and not in a good place. Capitalism made her poor, but not in a monetary sense, more in a metaphorical one, as she always felt like she's the worst, not enough and not achieving her goals, at the time that could very well be meant in regards to her career. And I feel like that's true for a lot of people who desperately chase after money, as they feel that they find no value in themselves or their existence without it and that just makes a lot of people miserable. Especially when through social media you can continuously compare yourself to other people, even if only subconscious and see that they are way younger than you and more successful already. We all know that social media isn't reflecting reality 100% and people often make things look better than they truly are, but still comparing yourself to someone like that can make you feel like you failed at life and in a way make you poor in a figurative sense
ENTREGOU TUDO CARALHOOOOWWWWW
this is trending i love it for you my queen
Also this is the little millennial sister of 'We Didn't Start The Fire', fight me
Elektra Heart is back 😢😍😍😍😍😢
Marina sigo soñando que vienes a Perú 😭💞
If Savages was on TFJ.
Ladies and gentlemen ✨her✨
Shes an icon, shes a leyend, and she is the moment
This 3:12 music video taught me more than what I learnt at university all those years.
The writing on this is immaculate. MARINA you are a true ARTIST!
poetry!!!!!!!!
Que tudo!!! 💖
And just like that we went from diamonds to witches...
Yes this is the Marina I love.
the red gloves = blood on our hands
THIS IS THE MARINA I MISS!!!! LOVE YOUUUU ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lo amé💗💗, siento que volviste a tus inicios de marina and the diamonds❤️
The meaning of this part stumps me... Any interpretations out there of this:   Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals cold A place so corrupt where Angel’s flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Studded with a diamond dew Saw the dawn was coming Everybody knew

ok I love this song, but the phrase "capitalism made us poor" sang by super rich person who makes huge money thanks to capitalism sounds a little disrespectful and privileged.
I love marina and this song  but Lol WTF   Captialism made us poor ???😂 is  this a joke?   1/4 of the goverment is female???---- who cares? serousily who cares, the only people who give a sh1t about this sort of stuff are rasicts and sexists.

She is referring to Dorothy's shoes, I don’t know why, but I think Marina referring to old cultural stuff so aesthetics, it kind of suits her, just like she did with Marilyn Monroe in The State of Dreaming
She really has a brilliant mind, imagine composing a song like that, with so many words combined in an addictive melody?? WE STAN A GENIUS QUEEN
I'm in love with this!

No war was ever won in anger  Purge the poison and we will be in peace Take back what is ours! ☮️
eres humilde mi chiquita te amo
💜💜💜💜
Her music has always been incredibly reflective, beautiful and thoughtful, but the way the content of the lyrics have grown and matured and the way she constantly experiments with her sound, it's just so lovely to get the privilege of hearing that, of a skilled artist sharing that growth with us in the form of FRIGGIN' BOPS. She's the absolute best. <3
This is giving me The Family Jewels vibes with a modern twist. . . LOVE IT!
I love you my queen, please come to Mexico someday
Te amo Marina, cuando te descubri en el 2013 estava en los u.s.a California resien llegado de Mexico queriendo y intentando el Sueño americano en ese entonces tenia 18 y resien operado de la pendise, un dia ya resien operado y en una pequeña traila donde vivia de renta con mi hermano estava viendo youtube y algo me dijo que le diera click a "Marina and the diamonds" (You are not a robot) y ya despues el resto es historia. Love you Marina 💍💖🎀
PERFECT! Electra Heart is alive!

I personally addicted to this song. ❤️ Indeed a QUEEN.

Love you marina
Sucks to see her pushing these bullshit agendas, including the NWO. Sis, just give us TFJ 2.0 and stop preaching fake shit.
Stylistically this reminds me of her older music, and I am so happy about that.
HOLY MARINA THIS IS STUNNING
This reminds me of We Didn't Start The Fire 🙈
OH MY GOD.

Britney shaved her hair... 💇‍♀️✨
Quel retour ICONIC après 6 ans d'absence !!!!! 🙏
A huge hit just born..marina for president
Personal opinion. I wish she would make music that wasn’t revolved around current topics. I want to escape the world, not hear my one of my favorites singers complaining...
Marina is everything i aspire to be. She gorgeous, but that’s not even the best part. She’s smart, talented, passionate, successful, and just overall admirable. I love her so much.
She’s an absolute icon
MARINAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS NEXT LEVEL ICONIC COME THRUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Просто королева 👑🔥🔥
YESS!!! QUEEN IS BACK!
Наконец-то 😛
YES QUEEN
Sound catchy tune
Marina is BACK! And we are to support our QUEEN 👑♥️💯
you're SO COOL. ALWAYS
god i love this woman
Well, quarantine is good for the planet. So that's a plus. Problem is, people as individuals can be kind and selfless. The larger the group of people however, the harder it becomes to make meaningful changes. Usually we need to be forced to do good.
HOW DID THIS MAKE ME FEEL NOSTALGIA FOR 2021? Wow! Definitely my Anarcha-Feminist Anthem. We miss you, Marina
I can’t believe we getting Family Jewels II. ✨💕
Occult twerking
Marina brought back her Diamonds 💎
Entregou tudooooh, te amo Marina 🇧🇷💖

mulher eu te amo sério obrigada por tudo que música perfeita
Essa é a Marina que a gente ama!
I feel like all of her eras are being surfaces within this song and her new album
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.
SERVIU EM TUDO MEU DEUS A ESTÉTICA PERFEITA
MARINA EU TE AMO PORRA QUE MÚSICA É ESSA MEU DEUSSSSS
Worth the wait again, been around since Obsessions had about 2k views (I remember someone wasn't happy what you were wearing and you commented back about not needing to look like one of the "Sunday girls". Very epic, loved it.) About 13 years later and I'm still amazed by everything you and your team have created. Looking forward to more
É A MAIOR DO MUNDOOOOO
Hinoo
Te amooo
Rainhaaa
GO MARINA GIVE ME LIIIIIFE
I just lost my wig
КАКМНОГОСЛОФФ,КАК МНОГОСЛОФФФФФ!!...СРАЗУУУ!!🤣🌺🤣
Reinota
We Stan
This gives me "We Didn't Start the Fire" vibes..
"Marina". Pensei que fosse brasileira. Edit: é, não tava tão errado assim kkkkkk
i cant believe marina invented water and happiness
"All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war"  Are you living in the US? Racism and misogyny isn't a problem at all, almost, in the West. Strange thing to focus on.   Capitalism literally made you a billionaire and has raised billions from poverty. Every economist agrees. So why mislead people with such a line?  America is the problem for everything, right?
Me encantó
Hearing the phrase ''capitalism made us poor'' from a person that has been able to make a highly successful career off of her music, has to be one of the most dishonest and ridiculous things I've ever heard.  Tell me more about how capitalism made you poor marina, tell me more about how you make concerts in socialist/communist countries. Oh that's right, you dont, you only do it in first world capitalist countries where people can actually afford going to a concert. As someone who has lived in Venezuela his whole life, please stop this bs.
久々に毒っけがあって最高 戻ってきた感じがする
I so much appreciate the good work of *coded_hack* on Instagram. He gave me access to my girlfriend device.😍

There are lyrics in the description, but the longer I listen, the more sure I become that they're incorrect... MARINA DESERVES BETTER!

Love this !!!
SIMPLESMENTE INCRÍVEL Conceito, aclamação!!!?
family jewels vibes and i LOVE it
Marina just never misses. So true queen
Grab a cuppa.  I think a part of me will always love Marina. I love how she sings about topical issues or reconfigures cliches into something more meaningful. But, the world right now is not as simplistic as this song (and Man's World) decry. There would be too much to go through right now, that seems a bit naive in this song (although sonically and visually it looks amazing), and that's because I'm dealing with a lot. But I'll say this... a woman, the new wife of my landlord appears to be making a heap of demands on my once kind landlord. And soon, I may be homeless. Homeless because she wants subway tiles or some shit. They're doing major renovations on both their million dollar properties and now they want to sell the rental I've lived in for twelve years. So, I've been calling the various homelessness resources, GOVERNED mostly by women, who are feeding me ice-cold attitudes and desensitisation (of which no sex is immune). And I'm dealing with a BArts degree at the best Uni in AUS, wondering if I'll be homeless. From "homeless to Harvard to homeless". I'm also dealing with health workers who are mostly women, as I have C-PTSD, and they aren't these shiny wonderful creatures just because they have a vagina.Some of them are fucking bitches from hell. Don't come at me because some guy pulled the wool over your eyes! Or fucked you over in some way. You aren't saints and angels yourselves. Most of you are manipulative, actually. I think it's important to remember that when someone has power, and there are a huge amount of societal sectors where that occurs (doesn't have to be politics), women are not immune to callousness. Plenty of women are in positions of power. It's not the government that will be helping me relocate, it's up to the woman in charge of my local homelessness organisation (the lovely anti-gay/ trans Salvation army) that my future and life is depending on. And it seems to me that rather than equalising the scales, the current feminist MO is to abuse men in a variety of ways, and to enable abuse. The abused becomes the abuser... As someone who was groomed by his mother to hate my father, making me feel like she was the victim of his alcoholism (and she was to a point). But beyond that simplistic picture, she was part of the problem. I have lived to protect my mum (was nearly killed by a machete by my dad) and other women in my life, only to come last on the list in homelessness shelters because some stoopid little girl got knocked up by some asshole and they get everything (because kids). On the streets I see mainly men that are homeless. In the small country town I moved to it's the women who have made life hard for me, with their gossiping ways. Do you know how damaging and destructive gossip can be? About to spend my 49th birthday alone tomorrow.  And this to someone who was sympathetic down to my core when it came to women. Now, I just see factions. Gender factions. But in reality, we can work together. Don't you know that 50% of women vote conservative? It's half of women that have created the problems other women now claim to be able to solve. It's all so naive. And it's GREED, not capitalism that is the problem. Why do people keep getting that wrong? I'm so tired of this century. Everyone is so dumb and making things worse. And the real problems go on. Women aren't creating a cultural revolution these days. Feminists did once, but not any more. The real questions you should be asking yourselves is... 1: How do you support men who support women? and 2: How to you deal with women who enable and support scumbag men? 50% of women voted for Trump, Johnson and Morrisson. What are you going to do about THEM?  So fucking get real and stop blaming my gender for all your problems. Take some responsibility for your life and where you position yourself. Britney had no problem being portrayed as a paedophilic sex symbol when she first came on the scene because she smelled the money and power. Now that she looks like a wreck, men are the problem. Pffff. She's just a dumbass.  Look, we've all been hurt. Focusing on the 0.0001% of men with actual power is basically retarded. And there are just as many women in power. Have they created utopia? In Germany? In New Zealand? NO. In New Zealand, indigenous people still suffer greatly, WITH A WOMAN IN CHARGE.   Are you getting the hint yet?  And for the record, this song shits on the lives of brave men and women (mainly MEN) who courageously fought in WWI and WWII against very real enemies. Millions paid with their lives for the freedom you take for granted. So, may God or whatever you believe in forgive YOU. We'd all be brainwashed Nazis if it wasn't for men. And yes, there have been unjust wars. So? Governments can be corrupt, like with Vietnam. Duh.  And where does this song talk about how people (men AND women) treat animals? THREE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND ARE STILL DYING. Show me some real guts and take on traditional medicine and animal handling norms. Go on then! I mean, it's so glaringly missing from this song! The misery animals suffer should put all humans' problems to shame!  ANYWAY, I feel like Marina will continue to grow as an artist, and hopefully she will come to fully understand what women AND men deal with in this fucked up world. Just spare me the sugar and spice bullshit. And you're not solving problems, you're making things worse than they already are.     "Most people can bear adversity; but if you wish to know what a [person] really is give [them] power."  "Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind."  - Robert Green Ingersoll    P.S. I don't check the replies to my comments, so GO OFF. Enjoy your delusions! Enjoy the fact that there are women already destroying men's lives and favouring females. Think about my words when you see men on the streets, and pass them by. They must've done something to deserve it, right?! It's not health issues that put them there. It's karma!   We were healing. Men were learning. Things were changing.   Drive a wedge which will never be healed.
Gives me family jules era vibes
A  BOP
The 80s-est 80s inspired I’ve seen so far

It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who'd you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that without me, you won't go far
I needed you back so much 😭❤️

The Lyrics of this song! Omg!

masterpiece
AAAA TE AMO MARINAAAA😭✨💗
#FREEBRITNEY
Here I am again watching this video uploaded again and I’m still in love
love u queen 🥰❤️
She's a hex girl now
Curiousity she got same haircut as Natalia Oreiro's Uruguay Actress / Singer in 2002 for her album called "Turmalina" Also the Hit for that album was called "Tu veneno" Which translate to "Your poison".  I mean, what a coincidence, plus the fact they look-alike a lot. Google it y'all
* CAPITALISM TWERKING *
Family Jewel vibes. This is giving me everything I didn’t know I needed 🙌🏻
This is a literal work of art
I AM NOW CURED AND HAVE NEVER HAD DEPRESSION
This is basically feminist rant, i love it!!!
Marina released a new song while im having a mental breakdown. Coincidence? I don't think so
é a patroa
#15 🇧🇷🇧🇷
I FUCKING LOVE THIS WOMAN
this song gets better and better the more you listen to it.
The artistic potency of Marina is Unmesurable, look at this MV, look at these lyrics, the vocal control, i just love so much.
🥰
Cuánto arte nos regalas.
Amo tu música.  Te amo a ti.
Great song...👌🏻❤
This song could fit RIGHT on The Family Jewels and I LOVE IT. It's like old Marina, it's so good.
Loove you
ended capitalism
Juust perfect
This song gives me vibes from her "family jewels" album for some reason and I like it
Wonderful!!! MARINAAAA YOU ROCKKKKK!!!!
Capitalism is a problem, free market is the solution. Fractional Banking is the economic poison.
THE VISUALS!!! THE SOUND!!! THE MESSAGE!! AHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH LAPUTAMADREMARINATEEEEEEEEAAAAAAMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
*termina cancion* *reproducir denuevo* TE AMO MARINA LPM TE NECESITABAAAAAAAA
I’m not gonna lie I think the song writing is a little overkill, I love the message but I think she could’ve still gotten her point across with lyrics that were more cleverly written. Some lines on their own are nice but the song feels more like a speech than a song.
I’m obsessed
i absolutely need to see her live again!!!!
people say if Froot and TFJ had a baby it would sound like this, but I disagree. This is completely different from all of Marina's songs, it's so unique. And I am so excited for this new era, it is gonna be so special.
queen,so talented
I adore you, really.
This mv is giving the same vibes of the "I am Not a Robot" and "Karma (Acoustic)" music videos
Está nueva era de Marina es lo mejor de 2021
Reina
Este vídeo merece más vistas
Te amo Marina
Love it Marina*
*twerks in queen*

Is Marina a practicing Wiccan? I couldn’t find anything confirming it, just thought so from what she’s saying at the beginning of the song?
Obsessed!! It combines her rock and roll and unique vocalizing of her older music with her increased vocal maturity and songwriting skills and lyricism!! 💖
Oooooooooo Honey She’s very angry and feeling her Family jewels mojo Back in this Era I am READY !!!!!!!!!!

Não é feminismo que vai concertar o mundo🤮🤮🤮 É união e respeito sem bandeiras.
Lyrics  All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage  Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?   [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus] It's a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are?

Another GREAT song, yet again from Marina.  She is such an icon for our current times. I love her.
God is a woman 💚
nice outfits; great song
God i love your music. You have your own style and sound. It is amazing.
I love you Marina, you have no idea..
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH ILITTTT
Te amo tantooo
Thank You Marina new Music for my Brain Pan 8))))))
A M A Z I N G
I've never felt the need to recover from a music video but HELLO, Marina, DAMN.   I liked the chill vibes of the last album and I always support whatever direction artists want to go even if it's a huge change, but I've been playing her old discography on repeat recently and I'm really glad she hasn't completely moved on from the glam stuff. Love it
I felt when she said WTF
i used to loooove marina... but now she’s just another ultra liberal feminist, and i just want regular, good music, not the same overplayed platitudes
Wow Okay TFJ I see you come through baby
Everyone is talking about the meaning of the song or how amazing she is. I just want to say how this feels like a family jewels or electra heart music video. Like it has nearly the same vibe as Oh No!
I love this already
1/4 in a business full of old people's pretty good '.' ,   that should become majority as more decades pass and the older generations vacate the business, '.' maybe a lot more decades, pretty sure the biggest wave's the youngest generation, so it'd be around when the current youngest generation in politics reaches the top 50% of oldest people, that could be 30-40 years away, lul, xP we'll all be old then, hopefully the age demographics within politics change before then, & speed up the process
Te amo 🇧🇷💚☠️
It’s almost like Mother Nature is singing directly to us
MARINA AND THE GAYS 🌈 I love u queen ❤️
AMEI
wow me sorprende su evolución musical , simplemente me encanta.

Man, the one who before used the name Marina and the diamonds, talking about capitalism, it’s like a white guy trying to teach a black guy about racism... Just don’t match and it’s kind of embarrassing... But the vocals and production are really great.
Thats it! ❤

she summarised our most visible problems without sugar coating them, apart from how amazing the production is, we must divulge the word she's given us
You're the coolest
AMO AMO
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it
Getting the Family Jewels vibes from this

I'm constantly amazed by how many different vibes she can pull off
anti-capitalist marina is the best marina
Serious family jewels vibes 💎❤️
I can feel some of the old Marina DNA for the first time in ages
💙💙💙💙
This feels so fresh and new and yet has elements that remind me of all of her past eras, just a perfect expression of growth building on her past achievements I LOVE IT
She's literally just writing about her feelings and her thoughts, reuniting all of us with the same type of sensitivity whilst still having great beats and melodies. What a a genius artist & human being. U GO GIRL !!!
PERFEITA! MULHER ENTANDA VOCÊ É UM ACONTECIMENTO! UMA FORÇA DA NATUREZA! LENDA VIVA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA TE VENERO!
so good
Estoy alucinado. Es como si volviera a la era pre-TFJ, cuando Marina hacía esos demos rockeros. Su voz juguetona también vuele a ser la de antes, y me encanta.
SHE CAME
Alternative pop princess bi*ch is back! 💚💎💉
Yuuuuh 😩👏🏾
I just love her so much
Omg this is so good 😍😍😍
* twerking while destroying the patriarchy *

A BANGER
purge the poison isn't just a song, it's a cultural reset, it's the oxygen you breathe, it's a lifestyle, a reason to breathe. It's food for the soul, a moment in history, what sets the dancefloor ablaze on the weekend.
💚Lyrics:  All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage  Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  It's a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?"  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far
I like the music itself but I can't understand half of what she's saying and the lyrics I can hear clearly are boring and miserable. I don't have a problem with music being political. Madame X was a great album but this is predictable and dull. After Man's World (which I didn't mind), it seems like we're going to be getting a whole album dedicated to hating white men and much as I love Marina, I can't be bothered for that. I don't think men are perfect and I don't think women are perfect. Nobody is. Why can't these feminist anthems be like the Spice Girls songs and more about girl power than going on about the patriarchy and capitalism? I get that she has a message but it doesn't make for good or even enjoyable music.
Marina always since the beginning sang about what she wanted to sing and I think that's amazing
OMG i love this
big the family jewels vibes w this one love it!!
Electra vibes,  LOVE IT!!!!
Hey, queen! Girl, you have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all 😍😍😍
GODDESS💚
**inspirational twerking**
Marina is the fucking QUEEN!!!!!!!
Haus of diamonds ya los tengo ubicados y les voy a plomear su grupito mierd4
LONG LIVE QUEEN MARINA SETTIN THE STANDARD FOR THE REST OF EM
I can feel the cultural reset
I love her
LA MUJER PIENSA LA MUJER PURGA EL VENENO
QUEEN😍😍
Apenas Marina pode salvar o planeta, apenas percebam isso 😭
Oh how i missed her
So basically, TFJ era is portrayed by Marina in that gorgeous translucent dress and curly hair, Froot era by that yellow onesie outfit  and ELECTRA is out of sight just showing her red gloves , red high heels and ofc her red glow lips.   Let me believe in my lie ok
The MARINAVERSE is finally here reunited with TFJ, Froot and Electra omg
So basically, TFJ era is portrayed by Marina in that gorgeous translucent dress and curly hair, Froot era by that yellow onesie outfit  and ELECTRA is out of sight just showing her red gloves and red high heels. Let me believe in my lie ok

Marinão, você é MARAVILHOSAAAAA
Catchy! The visuals of the music video is amazing.  OMG! She's wearing the blue socks and red shoes that Judy Garland wore!  Also love how she mentioned Britney Spears, how she shaved her head and everyone thought she was a joke while she was suffering from a mental breakdown. :( It's sad, I'm glad Marina brought this up.

OLD MARINA BEAT BUT MORE DEVELOPED LYRICS ABOUT THE WORLD UR AMAZING QUEEN I CANT WAIT FOR M5
Omg shes back i love her songs sooo much omg
Now she lives in Hollywood Then, Hollywood infected her brain, in a movie scene, puking American dreams Obsessed with the mess that's America... ooh, ooh...    It's like ancient 🤍MATD🤍 and W0KERINA has blended together 💞💕
Can we take a moment to appreciate how big of a true feminist icon she is
so good
I keep getting new music videos in my recommended-
This is like Family Jewels and Froot had daughter who hang too much with True Romance (Charli XCX)
Upbeat Marina? Ooo bring it on!
Old Marina its Back ! 😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷
Instant like
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MARINA'S VOICE SOUNDS SO GOOD IN ROCK SONGS. I MEAN HER VOICE FITS EVERYTHING OBVIOUSLY BUT HER VOICE SUITS ROCK SOSSOSOSOOSOSOSO WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Socialist icon 😍😍😍
Μαρίνα μάγισσα μου!
Te amo tanto 🤩😍❤️
YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!
why is everything you do perfect ????
✨ARTE✨
kinda glad i’m not that fluid in english bc sonically this song is driving me INSANE it’s really amazing but when i read the lyrics it’s not that good😅so i don’t really understand what she’s singing when i hear but i’m glad about it. i enjoy the song so much

FREE BRITNEY
HOW COME I DIDN'T SEE THIS BEFORE
MDS É ELA É MEU TUDO
MARINA IS BACKKKK 🤧🤧 HERE IS YOUR SIMPP QUEEN 😔🙏✨✨
A SUPREMA ESTA DE VOLTAAAA
perfect
This is high level discourse put into a song, and honestly I think it's the kind of thing we need more of. The easiest way to educate others now is through mainstream media. Marina is doing that beautifully here with the perfect mixture of talent and intellect. What's more, this happens to have been released on my birthday 🥺 which is a pleasant surprise. Thank you for this gift Marina, and for gifting us with a powerful message and call to action.
o surto de felicidade das viúvas do tfj
"Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war" She's always on point. This is what meaningful music is.
SHE'S THE MOMENT 🗣️
The witch song my Witchy Playlist didn't know she needed
the queen never disappoints
this album is going to make me die from how good it is
"It's your own decision, but your home is now your prison" That hit hard. Another example of Marina's brilliant lyricism
ok. a serve
Mi nuevo himno feminista :3
Queen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've been rewatching this for an hour
She's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment
YES
"Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed." Fucking GO OFF, MARINA. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #FreeBritney
Marina creating yet another anthem
Yyyaaaassssss
My jaw dropped I’m so excited to blast this in the car on the way home from work
🖤
This new Marina era is Froot but make it rock and political. And I'm fully on board with this idea, tbh
It's like the son of Froot and Electra Heart
Very good!
OUVI ESSA MÚSICA UMAS 10 VEZES HJ
From Girls to Purge the Poison, this guys it's what we call EVOLUTION OF A QUEEN
this is like a modern & feminist we didnt start the fire, love it!
Marina speaking for Mother Nature <3 THAT INTRO I COULD PLAY THAT ON REPEAT-- I love that we are a part of this song; her lyrics are absolutely immaculate! This is forever a bop and I am playing this on repeat
BIIIIG SAVAGES VIBES
OMG OMG OMG! It's just fantastic!
MARINA, TE AMO ERES UNA REINA
LET'S GO WITCHES  🦠🧪☠️
The power in calling everything out so blunt. It's like To Be Human and Savages had a baby but that baby came out angry at the world but ready to DANCE
yass queen
All my friends are witches? Larina is still a thing y'all 😭
Marina really just DID THAT!! We stan this flashy beginning of her next era!!! ♀♥
كلنا مو مستعدين للالبوم 😭😭😩
I LOVE HER SO MUCH
amazing....
Never disappoints 😍 so glad you’re making new musicccc
“Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor”  That’s a lie. Thanks to the capitalism we are getting less poor. Just watch the statics of 1800 and 2021. The poverty rate goes dramaticly down at the end of 20st and 21st century  Actually is the socialism and government intervention what are making us poor!  Love you Marina, but I got limits.
ARTE SIMPLEMENTE ES ARTE
capitalism makes us poor
this is the new “we didn’t start the fire”
🤠🤌 why does this slapppp LIKE imagine making the truth sound good wow
"God forgive America for every war.." Okay lol
This song feels like Mother Nature slapping you across the face. And you want to thank her. 💚🌺❤️
wicca vibes

This album will takes all the best things from all the previous one to make the best thing Marina has ever done. Man's World and Purge the Poison are already in my list of the best Marina's songs.

All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage  Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ MeToo went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣  Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  It's a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are?  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, who do you think you are It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far
I LOVE THE AESTHETIC OMGGGGG <333

Queen Marina salvando el 2021
How dare she says she won't make a feminist anthem and drop this banger?😅⚡⚡  [For clarity, this isn't meant as hate, it is a joke😅 I absolutely love this song, and Marina. I referenced one of her former songs, "can't pin me down" where she says "do you really want me to write a feminist anthem, because I am happy cooking dinner in the kitchen for my husband" meaning (i guess?) she doesn't need to make a feminist anthem in order to be considered as a feminist]
Icônica
Amo
QUEEEEEEEEN
Lo mejor

teeee amooooooo
💎
some critical analysis of this video that i gleaned from my first viewing and a few listens of the song:  as for the song itself, i love how she takes on the voice of mother nature combined with the voice some omnipresent benevolent godhead just observing society and shaking its head at us all. this approach has been done before in media, but often it comes off as really preachy and self serving, whereas I feel like in this song the tone completely separates Marina the person from the speaker of the message which is being conveyed by Marina. the speaker comes off as sincere and well informed, so the listener can easily believe that this is coming from the perspective of a higher power and not just a person preaching or trying to prove that they are “woke.”  as for the video, the most obvious theme i noticed first and foremost is that in most of the video she is looking directly at the camera addressing the audience. and the camera is most often in a fisheye lens (moreso in the beginning), which reflects how human eyes see and process the world. so it’s like she’s literally standing right in front of us, yelling at us how to fix the planet and our society, yet we’re just speechlessly ignoring her message but still recognizing its existence by continuing to watch and stay close. the whole video feels like it’s very intimate and interpersonal, like it’s just you and her, and you both know each other all too well. and she isn’t sad or desperate in her emotions, she is often smiling and dancing joyfully while still maintaining eye contact, but I think this is conveying her as mother nature continuing to live and thrive despite the damage that you, the viewer, has caused her. and even so, the proximity suggests that she is desperately trying to convey the message - her happiness being in defiance of your (society’s) hostility toward her.  as the video goes on, the fish eye shots appear less and the ones that replace them are wider and more traditionally voyeuristic shots that we are used to in a film or music video. and in doing so they also get dreamier, more blurred, and seem somewhat unreal. this is further enforced by all of the allusions to Dorothy in Oz (which imo feels a bit ham-fisted but it gets the message across to an audience that isn’t necessarily looking for the more artistic/subtle ways of conveyance). and overall, feel like the message of this imagery is that we are all deluding ourselves - we’re all living in this fantasy that everything is going to be okay and we can continue as we always have been, when everything is really falling apart right before our eyes. mother nature is literally treading water, she is begging for our help, and if we don’t she was soon become weak and drown. we are choosing to be voyeurs instead of friends, backing away from that initial fish-eye interpersonal position to a place where we can comfortably view her in distress. we are at such a distance that we could claim that we can no longer reach out hand, but we are the ones who put ourselves in that position.   and again, even though Marina herself does not express emotions of distress on her face, her emotions in the pool are more subdued and stoic and then at the beginning of the video where she is clearly joyful. and combining that change of expression with the consistent repetition of “who do you think you are?”, even though her intonation doesn’t change in the song itself, the question changes meaning as the video progresses.   in the beginning, it’s more a question of: “we’re friends, and what you’ve done has really hurt me. can you recognize that your selfish actions have caused me harm?” it’s a discussion where she is levelheaded and expressing her grievances; you are sitting across the table from each other, and she is informing you of your actions because she recognizes that you may not have realized you have hurt her; she is giving you room to apologize and repair the friendship.   near the middle, in the transitional period, it becomes: “why do you keep doing this? I’ve told you how much these actions have hurt me, and yet you are actively choosing to do so again and again. why do you think you can continue to treat me like this and I would be okay with it?” she is revealing a toxic pattern of behavior within your relationship where you are consistently hurting her but never apologize; you are her abuser. she’s also giving a kind of warning, that she will not tolerate such treatment for much longer, and that when she does eventually hit back, it will be justified and long overdue.  by the end, her saying “who do you think you are?” is meant in the way we all know it to mean, in that disgusted, vitriolic tone that one would shout at a pompous asshole trying to take your seat at the table. here, she has truly run out of reasons to defend you, and no amount of empathy and understanding in the world can allow her to forgive you. you may have reasons for your actions, but they are not moral or defendable reasons; they are narcissistic and selfish in the truest sense of the word. she has told you time and again that you are hurting her and has given you far too many chances to make amends. yet you not only refuse to show remorse, you ratchet up the violence in response to her pleas, because when she does not obey you, it conflicts with your narcissistic view of yourself - you see yourself as deserving of everything in the universe, even if that means destroying it.  you are our society, who disrespects her beauty and grace; you are imperialism, capitalism, greed, structural inequality and discrimination; you are destruction incarnate.   you are poison. and now, after all this time, she is going to purge the poison.
Greek goddess of earth
Why is nobody talking about the Rocky Horror references?

SHE MURDERED US WITHOUT MERCY
I usually don’t like any song on first listen but I loved this
LYRICS:    [Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood  Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war    [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?   [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣    [Pre-Chorus 2] It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day    [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far    [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?"   [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours    [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew    [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far

OMG THIS IS SO AMAZING
New video of MARINA. As someone says in the comments: Show enormous energy and propose new artistic images with color included. Those women shoes in the water with the bubbles included are a natural-artificial artistic design. She breaks free of her conservatism to show sensuality, as befits a WORLDWIDE ARTIST like Shakira. Of course, this sensuality is demure because Marina has a British intellectual background. She shows naturalness, for example, her loose hair looks good on her. In my opinion, it is shown in this video that MARINA can be Young, although her face may not believe it, and renew herself as a woman, breaking her own pre-established rational limits.
😍😍😍😍😍
Perfeita demais 🥺🤧
I love you💖🥲
Omg Rocky horror vibes ❤️❤️
"2007 when size zero was the rage Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed" #FreeBritney

Good forgive America for every single war. And forgive European countries for all the genocide and plundering that that have happened and continue to happen in Africa and South America.

FAMILY JEWELS IS BACK YALL
SOO GOOD AHHHH
I appreciate the feminist and pro-nature and anti-racism and anti-war verses, but I don't like how this is basically saying COVID is a punishment from nature. It is no better than the extremist religious people saying COVID is a punishment from God. It is insensitive to people who are suffering, & is making light of a tragedy that's killed millions of people and left millions more people traumatized.  Viruses don't come into fruition just because humans aren't good to the earth. All animals get viruses, not just humans. Many animals don't even live nearly as long as humans do. Like dogs live an average of 14 years before dying of natural causes. Is nature punishing them? I don't think so. I don't think nature is punishing humans, either.  Although I agree that humans should treat the earth better, this whole "nature is punishing humanity" is insensitive and untrue. We can advocate for better treatment of minorities & the earth without making light of a tragedy that's hurt and killed millions of people.  Edit: Also...the virus has hit minorities MUCH harder than it has hit privileged people. By this song's logic, nature would be punishing minorities harder than privileged people.  But the song also speaks against discrimination, which is good, so I don't think you would agree with that. So like I said, maybe it's better to get rid of the "covid is a punishment" entirely. It's not only nasty by itself, it can lead to even nastier implications (I actually have seen racists say that the virus has hit black people harder because black people are being punished by God).
Major Froot vibes (which has always been my favorite sound) packing punches like "Savages" with every line!  "Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war"
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I. LOVE. YOU. SO. MUCH.
Love it
Between this and Man's World.... guys her best album is coming. PERIOD
Imagine saying capitalism made us poor 💀 bitch i-
It's too preachy. js

Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  It's a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?"  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far

I hope this gets the hype it deserves!
We have the family jewels marina back!!!!!!
We stan a strong independent woman who's able to call out basic bitches, misogynist men and capitalism
Classic Marina, Family Jewels vibes 💎 but on another level 💛💚💛💚
YES MA'AM
I feel a Amy Winehouse + The Family Jewels energy and I'm here for it
"Capitalism made us poor". I understand what she means about the not fair world we live due capitalism. But I'm afraid of that statement it's somekind of preach for socialism or communist, the same ones that are killing my country, and oppresing other countries, Russia, North Korea, China  (which it's basically the same capitalism without elections) Capitalism isnt god, but neither it's socialism/communist.
Let's all thank Marina for inventing lyrics

THE LYRICS
this must be one of her best songs lyrically and sonically. damn. what a fucking masterpiece.
[LYRICS] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches, making our own sisterhood While society is failing, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing?

It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who'd you think you are? I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude is coming, everybody knew Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who'd you think you are?

It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far
QUEEEEEENNNN 😭😭😭😭😭
I would have liked this song but she is talking about capitalism. That why she shouldn't involve herself in politics. She benefits from capitalism (because people are buying her songs) and communism isn't a good option, just look at communist countries. Instead of Capitalism she should have denounced over comsuption. Capitalism isn't the problem. The problem are people buying a thousand of things that are useless or not healthy for the planet.
I’m getting “the family jewels” vibes and I love it😍
wow marina absolutely did what she needed to do <3 I am so In love with this one
froot amaria ter esta no album
I ADORE YOU
Truly enchanting its like the Family jewels & Froot blended with a dash of late 80s and early 90s!  Your creativity is truly art Marina ! ♡♡♡
Reminds me of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”.

I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far
COMING TO SAVE THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
marina serving once again 💕💕💕
Contagious af   A bop beat with an actual message: Why we <3 Marina! LOVE TO SEE IT
Read the lyrics and what a beautiful song ❤️
TFJ: who are you? ADIAML: i am you but stronger
this feels like all her previous eras put into one huge bop. what a queen
This is the most HD video I have ever seen
killing it. as always. our queen dropping an album and this BANGER on the same day
I feel like this is going to be my favorite era of hers. So far I am loving both Man's World and Purge the Poison. Also, she looks hotter than ever.
OMG THIS IS LIKE THE UPDATED WE DIDNT START THE FIRE
Amazing, Marina I ❤️ you !

thx for save my sick Wednesday, Queen!!! 🙏😭✨💖💕
Been following Marina since Myspace. Got to see her live twice when she came to Vegas. Her voice in concert is something unforgettable. She's the epitome of artistry: raw, authentic, and true. What a force of nature! I've loved watching her metamorphosis. There's no doubt she keeps ascending.
With marina, you wait for her to drop more music, but it’s always worth it.
The clapping bit gives Night Club vibes. 😁
The Family Jewels 2.0
amo os clipes de 10 reais da Marina 💙
Back to the roots! Family Jewels vibes!!!!!!!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Am I the only one who is getting old Marina and the diamonds vibes from this? At first I got Electra heart vibes, then The family jewels, but I also hear some Froot influences. I am in love already
Este álbum va hacer una bomba!!😍

PLEASE MARINA COME TO BRAZIL
Electra Heart vibes 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻
This is so fresh! I Love It!
Banger
She is so amazing! I just feel so much honesty in her words! And this song sounds so much like her. It has a mixed vibe of The Family Jewels and FROOT! I'm living for it! Can't wait for June <3
Why 4:3 video format?
MARINA MINHA FILHA VOCE ENTREGOU TUDOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Im so proud  of you for follow your journey of being to true to yourself . You are fucking glowing in this!!!

COMMUNIST GODDESS

Queen

This killed me and gave me a new life to live.
Brazil loves you queen 🖤
AKIDJSJAGSNSAN OH MY GOD. AMAZING.. I'm now listening on repeat to learn the lyrics
Giving us the  "The Family Poison" vibe  💖💖💖
Ok, make fucking tik toks this need to exploit as it should!!
REFERENCE: THE MOUTH FROM THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
This is PERFECTION
I’M LIVING GURL
Love you so much Marina 🖤
The early 2000s vibes are killers I already love thos whole ablum
She didn’t hold back, AT ALL.
Cmon eras!!!!
this song is like the feminine alter ego of "people" by the 1975
Ahhh 2004-2007 era was crazy lol.
I thought St Vincent's latest music videos were my favorites of the year so far, but this video is damn near perfect.
the family jewels + froot = purge the poison = pop perfection
AAAAAAAAAaaaaaAaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaAAA  DiositA Marina 🙏🏼✨💖💕  I love you so much. We support you from Mexico. ✨🧪☠️🧪✨
me: I looked at Marina's dms on: uniid.lol <~ Im criying, poor boyfriend: "I hope it changes" Like if you love Marina
Marina queen
TODAS AS MINHAS AMIGAS SÃO BRUXAS
OKAY SHE MIGHT'VE SNAPPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the lyrics 😍
te amo vc é pft Marina
Finally Marina our religion
Олдскулы свело.
Her lyrics tho🙌🏻💚💚
I WASNT PREPARED BESTIE
Tudo pra mim

Argentina loves you
I love that it’s modern but calls back to Family Jewels . WE STAN
queen
The vibes from this era <3
I missed this so much, I feel like I'm alive again. Marina thank you so much💞
new mental breakdown song
Diosa bella.
I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS!
YESS OMG ITS SOOOO FCKINGGGG GOOD
I've listened to this three times now  one word :    QUEEEEEEEN !!!!!😍😍😍
Her lyricism is phenomenal on all her songs!
Sonically it reminds me of The Family Jewels but the lyrics is really Love + Fear and I can definitely hear some Electra Heart and FROOT sounds too. This is like all of her music combined
she kate nashed herself
She can do any genre??? Rock, pop, indie, I want to see her R&B even though that’s not her style
U GO GIRLLLLLL
IM LIVING FOR THIIIIIIIISSS this "instrument" sound (the drums are so clear etc) fits her so much 😭😭
I love this sounds like it’s straight out of The Family Jewels
AMEI
''All my friends are witches'' There has been a lot of talk about the overlap of 3rd wave feminism and witchcraft, I guess Marina is a witch herself? I don't know if she's spoken already about her spiritual practise, but I'd be interested to learn this side of her!
We didn't start the fire?
Did I just heard The Family Jewels kind of production plus Homewrecker meets Bubblegum Bitch melodies??? 😍
You're an icon, baby ❤
PERFEITA
This is like Froot and The Family Jewels had a baby and I AM LIVING
Que bien que canta la Oreiro
WOAH her lyrics are always so powerful! ✨
♥️♥️♥️♥️I loved your new song Marina ♥️♥️♥️
Ladies and gentleman our old MARINA is back❤️
she is back

This feels so old and fresh at the same time. Like future nostalgia by dua
👑🖤
💗💗💗💗 loveeee this
Ela é tudo
Is it just me or does Purge the Poison feel like To Be Human’s parallel/twin. They both convey a similar message but Purge the Poison is the action while To Be Human is the call to action.
Bubblegum Bitch vibes.....but so much better. 💁🏻‍♀️✨
Πόσο καυλιάρικο ρεφρέν
Yaaaas queen 😍😍😍
The “somewhere over the rainbow shoes” tho ✨
Me encantaaaaa 🥰
ooooole
Okay but can we talk about how good she looks, WHAT 🤩✨

This era is POWERFUL! <3

Sending 💌 to everyone!You got this!💕
Marina just described the whole corona pandemic in one song as a feminism anthem. What a queen
QUEEEEEEEN OF ROOOOOOCKKKKK
This has the same vibe as her first album! I love the return to her edgier, social commentary side. This is the perfect sound track to second resurgence of the #MeToo Movement. Well done Marina! I hope the entire album is in a similar vein.
THIS IS FUCKING GREAT I CANT BREATH I LOVE HER SO MUCH SHES BACK THE QUEEN IS FUCKING BACK
Finalmente uma farofaaaaa
Wizard of Oz and Rocky horror picture show vibes IM HERE FOR IT
Yesss I was craving new music
Icónica mi reina ✨

Anyone else getting some We Didn't Start the Fire from this?
i love how she tryna convey that don’t forget Mother Nature is our home (whereas she’s healing from all of what we’ve caused) so, stay at home because home is not a prison since people have been feeling “imprisoned” these days due to pandemic but it’s for our safeness and so, we must listen and avoid partying n crowded places. anyways, stay safe everyone!💛 x
bestie your vocals never dissapoint
THIS IS SO ELECTRA??????? IM DYING
giving me electra heart and froot and I love it sm
CHORUS???????? ATE
This is PERFECT, thank you marina
There is one word that describes this entire song: Period!
THE EFFECTS AND EVERYTHING
the lyrics!!! truly a sign of the times.
THE  VIDEO THO
[Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling, we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage  Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein's gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ Me Too went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus 2] It's a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate Stopped how we'd been living every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?"  [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is now your prison You forgot that, without me, you won't go far

This song sounds so timeless, the type of song the future generations will listen to if they ever want an insight of what all of us went through.
🙌🏼🥰
It’s like Electra Heart had a child with The Family Jewels 💎 ✨ Hope there’s more like this one on your new album 🖤 P.S. Please come to Cardiff! Hope to see you again one day 💃🏻🤗
👁️⚡🌈☁️✨🌟
She is right , we need to purge the poison from the system. like the far left, or the woke  and politically correct nutters. They are poisoning our planet.

Facts
Al fin esta teniendo el reconocimiento que siempre ha debido tener porque ella es puro talento. BRILLA mi chiquita que el mundo vea que naciste para ser una ✨Leyenda✨
Marina is one of the best songwriters, this is a fact, but I think this song has her best lyrics ever. The lyrics represents the present so badly, but the song has such TFJ vibes, and I am living for it!
MARINA YES
A child of Froot and TFJ indeed
Mi diosa griega
HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE ANY DOWN LIKES FOR THIS MASTERPIECE
Omgggg I´ve missed Marina so much!
LINDA MARAVILHOSA TE AMOOOOOOOOOIO
YES MY QUEEN!!!!
This video remind me of The rocky horror picture Show, Love it 😍
Marina has been my #1 favorite artist since 2015 and after this I’m pretty she’s going stay at 1st place for a VERY long time. I literally know the lyrics to every song she has ever made
these lyrics are so amazing
Marina la vida seria realmente angustiante sin tu musica, te quiero
she is here to save the music industry
YEEEEESSSSS
The queen!

I loved the video, I loved the song. Excited for the album!
Amazing
YES
amazing as always! will the be a vinyl for the album?
I think this is incredible! Marina says so much in this song, and the way she puts it all it fits so well with the intruments and the melodies, it is a great great composition! I'm very excited for the album.
"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it".
Family Jewels vibes?? 😍🥰😍🥰
She just doesn't miss
she NEVER misses!
Everyone jump
TE AMOOO REINOTAAAAA🥰🥰🥰🥰
ok now i'm totally here for it
I’m glad I found and fell in love with Marina before she blew up on tik tok, however I’m so happy she’s getting a bigger fan base now 😊

Fantastic!  Taps back into the Aware vein of American Dream ~ pop music with substance.  Looooove.  This new material delivers.  Cohesive with theme and strength.
Mermaid vs sailor and froots baby
*  *twerking glamorously* *
the rocky horror picture show + wizard of oz + britney: trash pop culture juice welcome to the family jewels
*Poisonous Twerking*
POR FAVOR REPRODUZCAN ESTA CANCIÓN DEBEMOS DE LLEGAR AL MILLÓN HOY POR FAVOR POR FAVOR POR FAVOR 😭 MARINA LO MERECE
☄️☄️☄️☄️🧡🧡🧡😭😭😭😭te amoooo
happy :)
I AM OBSESSED!! I LOVE YOU MARINA❤️
IT'S 2005
💌💌💌💌
PS. She is MARINA (as in, "from the sea" in Romance languages like Spanish, Portuguese and Italian), and she has aquatic, mermaid like aesthetics here. I love that detail <3
Marina knows how to write what we are going through. Her music is therapeutic.
Guys this album is another reason why Melanie Martinez and Marina should collab someday. I think they would create a mystical and empowering masterpiece
perfeitaaaa
the family jewels vibe 🙏❤️❤️
Te amo mamãe
omg new album new era <3 <3 <3
who’s also joined the sisterhood? what does that mean?!
Save us, Marina!
Bapho ❤️
She is so golden and I can’t
The Rocky Horror Picture Show references are on point! The glittery red lipstick and the latex gloves *chefs kiss*!
ATTENTION! ATTENTION! Marina is an amazing artist. Her visuals are amazing, her voice is amazing, and her lyrics are refreshing. That is all. Enjoy your day🌼
THANK YOU for crediting the whole crew in the description. It's unbelievable how rare that is
I love this bop and love marina even though my political views are not of hers I respect her opinion and like that she is using music to send a message
THE DRAMA!! I LOVE IT
Love the song, dig the aesthetics, but the lyrics are embarrassingly woke (or trying to be). Stick to what you know and what you’re good at, Marina! No need to virtue signal, we all love you no matter what! Just my opinion.
The Family Jewels vibes 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I’m fucking love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Marina keeps talking about witches while she's getting more beautiful with the years... hmmm!
if froot and the family jewels had a child:
TE AMOOOOOO
Bye Marina! Your world is not my world 🤷🏻‍♂️
Queen 👑
YASSSS MARINA, love this omg. She really is the most versatile queen
LINDAAAAAAA
THE OUTFITS I REPEAT THE OUTFITS

_rebelious twerking_     i just had to hop on this super unorigonal comment train i'm sorry i couldn't resist-
nunca errou ♥️
SHE SPILLED FACT NOT TEA
I used to love marina's music and songs but honestly, it's not like it used to be. This song and the one before are full of anger and hate. How can someone who sang so beautiful songs create something like this... 😔 may God keep you safe...
I love it😍❤
amazing
MY MOM IS BACK BITCHES

Time to listen to this and only this until the album comes out

IN LOVE WITH THE LYRICS  [Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus 2] It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?"  [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me, "Who do you think you are?" It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far

This sounds and looks amazing, I miss this Marina
Noooo!!!! The shop replies with a 403 HTTP error, "not authorised to access this page (shop.marinaofficial.co.uk)"?!?!? What happened there??? And by the way? what happened with the "Man's World" 7" in pink vinyl? I never received the mail that it's available (although I registered for it) and now I see that it's actually sold out ... how disappointing ... :-(
*THIS is the family jewels + Electra heart had a baby.* Love in Greek goddess and Love who's herself. MARINA!!!💗🥺
What did she say?? THAT. Preach Marina!!!!
Simplemente mi diva
This woman does not stop giving us art ❤️❤️🌹
This is a pure serve

The music and video style is so different from her other work, but I LOVE it! There’s definitely some The Family Jewels in there somewhere! Can’t wait for this album! 🤩
STREAM ITTTT
i don't like u
Marina single handedly saving pop music
This song is so iconic I can't even wrap my head around it.
QUEEN
Hmm, my favorite Marina is lost (I fell in love with her just because of L&F album, I love also Man's World, the rest of her music - I feel nothing). This PTP....hmm, it was difficult to watch until the end. Also, what for to sing again about the same stuff? Two singles in a row? I am sad.
Marina !!!!! Thanks for not depriving us any longer !! 🖤🦠☠️✨
Marina exude the poison
Se vuoi pestami a ritmo di questa canzone. 💫ICON💫
amazing
THE QUEEN IS BACK
These lyrics are really good
Oh my god. Oh. my. god. I love this song. I love this song. I love you Marina ♥
I FUCKING LOVE IT
Damn. This is amazing. Those lyrics are hitting home. 👏
Marina, entenda que você é perfeitahhh
Popular opinion: Marina’s musics are cachy in the first time we hear and still cachy forever
"escucha las palabras de las brujas"
Ooh myyy
Marinaaaa we love youuu TwT
I just sat like this :O throughout the whole thing. AND HELLLOOO HER BIO ARE WE GETTING A NEW ALBUM???
MARINA I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Already a bop omg ❤️❤️❤️❤️

OMGGGGGG
OMFG FINALLY
All witches in line with dorothy shoes , c moooon 👫👬👭
Our Greek goddess is here to blow our minds once more!
Where**
Am a huge fan but tbh I'm not digging the new material all that much. If I dropped all music I love because of political content I'd have nothing to listen to at all. Nothing wrong with a message. But the new album seems to be nothing but messaging and complaining about political issues from a very narrow point of view. I'm getting way too old to listen to punk.
she never failed in her discography
yes I love it!

Ahora a hacerle stream a MARINA <3<3<3<3<3
Marina eu te amo 💗
Perfeitaaaa Brazil love you🇧🇷
TFJ and Froot vibes. This album is going to be amazing.
Thank you for this bop mom
soberana
Ahh the subtle movie/pop culture references I love!   Also I love how retro this sounds!
Oh My Goodness..I am literally Speechless! This song is like no other- the lyrics of this song are addressing humanity's mistakes and how humanity forgives and punishes. The meaning goes so deep and i love it. The song isn't about a break up, or drugs or something basic. This is why I love Marina so much! Her songs MEAN something! My favourite lyrics are "Who do you think you are?"- like EXACTLY! Who DO we think we are?! We don't have the right to hate or destroy peace, we dont have the right to destroy the environment or take animals lives(i could go on) yet humans think they are so great. Anyway, thanks for reading this comment-this is at least how I feel about the song. Like this comment if you think Marina is such a special person!
This era bring me a family jewels vibes  Love you marina
periodt marina let's goooo
Witnessing history....

Marina really did THAT
Listening for 11 years and I’m still left starstruck every time I hear her music
[Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God, forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus 2] It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?

[Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?

I'm not a robot vibes in this video.
Vem pro Brasil mulher 😭😍

Lyrics: All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far

She’s already for the new era!!!
I absolutely love it
electro heart entered the chat: ppls: cringe marina's fans: YASSS BITCH 😏😎✌️🥰
I see the album topic now and how Marina really went over and beyond with her discography starts with her struggles in family jewels and electra heart, worked towards fixing them in froot, was finally at peace with herself in l+f and now she's going to face a much bigger enemy, human greed
queen
Love the Björk look

PURGE THE POISON
Lirycs  [Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus 2] It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far

electra is back
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.
I love the make up she put😍

I just peed myself
Это прекрасно.

LYRICS [Verse 1] All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is falling we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  [Pre-Chorus 1] Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God forgive America for every single war  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] 2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  [Pre-Chorus 2] It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Post-Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  [Bridge] I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  [Pre-Chorus 3] Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew  [Chorus] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  [Outro] Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far

God is back 💓💕💛💛💛
My heart and soul are ju-ju-jumping in joy!  All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood While society is failing we are quietly reforming Protecting the planet, healing our own damage Quarantined all alone, Mother nature's on the phone "What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn From every disaster, you are not my master"  Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity All the bad and good, racism and misogyny Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor God forgive America for every single war  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are?  2007 when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣ Britney shaved her head and All we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣ Harvey Weinstein’s gone to jail⁣⁣⁣ ‘Me Too’ went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣ Truth and all its glory⁣⁣ ⁣ The ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣  It’s a new world order⁣, everything just falls away⁣ Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday Inside all the love and hate we can now regenerate It's all that we believe in every single day Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? I just want a world where I can see the feminine We only make up one-quarter of the government Like an angel gone to hell Cast the moon under our spell Owning female power, taking back what's ours  Earth is like a white rose Quiet cloud of petals fold A place so corrupt where Angel flesh and blood is sold The feminine is born as new Started with a diamond dew Solitude was coming, everybody knew.  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far  Need to purge the poison from my system Until human beings listen Tell me who do you think you are? It's your own decision But your home is not your prison You forgot that without me you won't go far.
