They version of God lives
Yeah, in the fire, been tried Affected the way I been wired inside You can hide or glide I could've been deported That's the definition of a "Fight-or-flight" You can type all you like, I know about homeless Immigration, they took me from my mum's arms Fuck a gun charge, two swords, I'm a Ronin Błaszczykowski, I'm tryna score with the Polish Pain in my eyes, plans of me stayin' in the guide With a vision of this changin' my life Crime's on the rise, hate's on the rise Feel like everythin' but my mum's pay's on the rise "Did you come through?" That's the question Affording a burner was never man's problem Adoption, we couldn't find homes for the weapons By the station, we got poles, no election In the fire, been tested Before I had money, it was time I invested Nothin' changed, still time I invest in Watch-game delicate Tutankhamun, there's money in skeletons All I gotta do is point, they're gonna sever his head And tell ... that we're better as friends Nights that I can't remember with some people I could never forget Casa Cruz, you could bet a Nusr-et Don't make me call a young gunner on the back of a 'ped Slappin' a lead, civilians grabbin' your friends There's chaos on the main road, they called choppers and PEDs All because of some shit that you said I got killers with me (killers with me) And they love me, they make a man's heart stop The shit you find horrifyin' gets laughed off I'm like Meekz, bro, I won't stop, can't stop Yeah, it's kinda different when the fire's what you
Masterclass
Legends of the uk rap scene on this track😮

Salaam All readers, I have known that Ibrahim (PBUH) was tried in the fire. May Al-ALA keep him close to AL-RAHMAAN, AL-RAHEEM, AL-AHAD, Allah Azawajal 🤍🤍💛💛🤍♾
Who is still here in August 2025
I found out about ghetts from this song and ever since then I've been listening to him.  Man is just too exceptional.  I wished he was the one going against Joyner Lucas who happened to also be one of my favorites
I dunno how many times I've commented..damn this a masterpiece 😢shout out to the whole crew *Have you been tried😢😢 I ain't trying to be somebody to anybody❤❤
Love this ❣️❣️❣️
GOOOOODDDDDDD DAVVVVVVEEEEEEE
Bro squeezed and he missed but we admire a tryer finesse kid you could never lie to a liar.
Still one of my GOATED albums (We’re All Alone in This Together)  Nahhhh, Dave’s talent is wild 😭😭
My money is on UK rappers any day, anytime. You feel the essence, you feel the truth, you feel the energy and finally you feel what you can't feel elsewhere. Thank you Dave!

She's got a man's singing voice
1st July 2025  Waiting for the album
Meekz killed it man shit hot so he is ❤
That ronin/blazakowski/Polish lyric, is the best bar in the history of rap. Please, please, please look it up on rapgenius to understand. It's the greatest lyric ever.
Incredible all around 🔥❤️
Ghetts audience silence speaks ✅
This gun don’t bring nothing but prison and death. 😢
This is too good bruh.
1000000/1000000❤️‍🔥🖤✨🔥
Very unpopular opinion but I think giggs ruined this
Fredo want to go home so bad 🤣🤣
The UKs Prince
When dave says I've got killas with me and giggs smiles you just know the verification code with that smile
Classic performance
What a performance man, coming back to this in 2025 and still finding it hot, In the fire is a classic, and there’s no forensics.
The intro doesn’t get enough credit.
EPIC!!!!!!!!!
Who's the 3rd guy?
This song resonates with me so much rn it brings tears to my eyes
Thur, 24 April 2025.
Dave 🙌
“He needed no temple. He was the altar"
I’ve listened to this song weekly since the album was released over 3 years ago. I know it word for word. Somehow I had never seen this live version. Absolutely mind blowing.
Dave could be a one man band
Masterpiece
Came looking for a music video, got a so much more.
Mars 2025
Na Dave is everything music😭‼️
Giggs wasted the verse 😢🎉
It actually brings me so much proudness, to see SBTV dave from 10 years ago. Dropping a guitair solo as a superstar.
“Me an santan you won’t see nothing like us again”.  2025 an we still ain’t seen nothing like it
One of the best live performances ever
That performance was FIRE!!!
I know I got religion I belong to the laws and crew You see we fought when we get happy That's the way we Christian do Oh (Have you been tried-) Have you been tried in that fire? I heard bullets sing higher than Mariah in choir Spent a lot of time trappin', now I'm tryna retire But this shit runs in my blood, and I'm the guy they require And these guns bring nothin' but prison and death, still All my niggas just admire the fire Bro squeeze and he miss, but we admire a trier Finesse king, you can never lie to a liar But Fred got the fire, I fire for days I gotta write them in my notes, they'll be ignitin' the page Grindin' on cold nights, puttin' light to the flame Now there's no flame that can melt the ice in my chain, yeah I really put the ice in rice for the 'caine Me and Santan, you won't see nothin' like this again That's my young boys again, on the glide with the flame I just really hope your block came with fire-escapes Before my entrance, I took the fire exit Tried and tested, about twenty times arrested Two times guilty, no comment, I guess they guessed it Couple time bail, no forensics This a Deezy pendant, I don't need a necklace We stay protected and connected It's the energies I'm blessed with And now they watchin' like Netflix, had me doin' next shit Tryna get rich, but what's rich? Took more losses than Boris I sold more boxes than the post-office Twenty-one in jail, it turned me so solid Why you think my vision sick, I changed the game in my brain And sold robotics If you fell in my fire, you probably roast on it Heat up the stove and put hope on it Cah they don't care 'bout our lives, I put my soul on it I'm done tryna be somebody to some nobodies I'm bein' so honest, and they don't know porridge If I get burnin' while I'm watchin', higher learnin' Guns bustin', tyres turnin', that's a Russian and a German That's your phone ringin', you can hear the beep You won't be saved by the bell when you hear the screech And it's so deep, open, ocean This man escapin' some shells they can barely see Me and bro raisin' hell, we gon' share the heat Now put us in the same cell, we gon' share the sleep Am I my brothers keeper (it's deeper) I'm my brothers leader (speaker) I'm the eldest The one who had to make a name so the bells ring So nobody would trouble my siblings in this whirlwind My older cousin wasn't known for nothin' Never had no one I could call, but I was old in somethin' I'm diggin' deep with this tool like I'm known for plumbin' Somethin' in your chest like it's Robitussin Word to arsonist, I burn all this I stood in front of all three dragons and heard "Dracarys" And now we're jumpin' out G-Wagons and murkin' parties Man are comin' out with these bangers and dirty dancin' Nobody puts baby in a corner I uplift my girl, like I'm Swayze in the water And if it's already written, maybe I'm the author So accustomed to the fire, I get shivers when I'm naked in the sauna How, many times have they mistaken me for Scorcher? I'm lookin' in the mirror, sayin' "Justin, just cool, huh" Send Ghetts downstairs and tell them "Just bring me water" And tell Ghetts I put somethin' in the formula I'm focused, I don't need to burn the kush This is Moses speakin' to the burnin' bush I stood in front of the fire and learned to cook Finished my verse and never heard a hook Riskiest numbers, this jungle, stick through your youngers He's hungry, picked off the fungus Kept humble, slipped him a hundred Yeah, lived in a dungeon Those AirMax, which nigga stung them? Can't walk in my shoes, you could be riskin' a bunion The government's twisted I cover this shift to cover this Christmas Forget them old friends, I'm done with those bitches They color coded my brothers and sisters Run the rhythm, you're a brother, but you run the rhythm Try accusin' me of colorism Blinded 'cause you look at me with tunnel vision I was fallin', but I've gone and risen Is this nigga trusty or Sideshow Bob when he's creepin' on Krusty? Streets keep me tusslin', people disgust me Racist disease, that shit that disgust me Don't touch me on the streets with the sweeper 'Cause the streets pretty dusty And I've always got love for genuine people that bust me Santan and the gang advisor, I'ma check him out, I'm a analyzer She was callin' me an antagonizer Let me sanitize, where's the sanitizer? (Jheeze) Just flutter by, he said "Giggs can you handle this?" He said "Float like a butterfly" I bring truth, but they love a lie Plans, I'm the man you should run 'em by In the fire, been tried Affected the way I been wired inside You can hide or glide I could've been deported That's the definition of a "Fight or flight" You can type all you like I know about homeless Immigration, they took me from my mums arms Fuck a gun charge, two swords, I'm a ronin Błaszczykowski, I'm tryna score with the Polish Pain in my eyes, plans of me stayin' in the guide With a vision of this changin' my life Crimes on the rise, hates on the rise Feel like everythin' but my mum's pay's on the rise "Did you come through?" that's the question Affording a burner was never mans problem Adoption, we couldn't find homes for the weapons By the station, we got polls, no election In the fire, been tested Before I had money, it was time I invested Nothin' change, still time I invest in Watch-game delicate, Tutankhamun, there's money in skeletons All I gotta do is point, they're gonna sever his head And tell- that we're better as friends Nights that I can't remember with some people I could never forget Caza Cruz, you could bet a Nusr-et Don't make me call a young gunner in the back of a PED Slappin' a lead, civilians grabbin' your friends There's chaos on the main road They called choppers and PEDs All because of some shit that you said I got killers with me (killers with me) And they love me, they make a mans heart stop The shit you find horrifyin' gets laughed off I'm like Meekz, bro, I won't stop, can't stop Yeah, it's kinda different when the fire's what you start from Have you been tried in the fire? (Hot) Have you been tried in the fire? (Yeah) Have you been tried in the fire? (Oh yeah) Tell me (did you come to) Did you come to Have you been "Do your research to travel Don't see, don't really see the corners of the world That are alien to you, really do interest you And you know, 'cause in due process then you'll meet new people And then those people will tell you new stories Then you become a voice for the voiceless I mean, you should ask Daniel, really, truly, where he goes to find himself 'Cause I don't know anything, I'm just speculatin' More importantly for you and your family You then get to ask the questions and answer the questions About where you were made Like "Where you come from, where you're goin, London, Lagos, LA" The journey is the film"

Jesus loves you Joshua 1:9
"The shit you find horrifying gets laughed off, I'm like Meekz bro I can't stop won't stop." Pure poetry, Dave was right on it
This season of my life I am being tried in the fire, at times I feel like I should flight but mans fighting. I will come out pure as gold.

Amazing song.. god bless you all Xo
I've been scrolling down and down no talks about  Meekz's voice sounding the best and exactly from the original song
👿

Always back to feel the same emotions everytime
Giggs so calm but gang 😂❤

Iconic ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥👑🐐
Ghetts put his soul in that verse
That choir was absolutely incredible. They added SO much power and feeling to it. What a beautiful performance.
Ghetts spazzed on this one.
Fire
❤🎉
Ghetts
Right way that way 👌🎂🥰🙏🏿🤣❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘💕💕💕
Nadway❤️🎂🎂🎂🎂

When The Crowd Realized It Was Meekz✅✅✅✅✅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a load of shit
Happy Easter or happy ramadam..❤🎉
This song would have been ideal for Top Boy
Before the entrance I took the fire exit
Big tune Meeks is cold
This performance is just flawless!!!🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
truly the greatest of his generation
This is real!
Get goosebumps from this performance every time 🔥
https://youtu.be/ynNsuyneTwo?si=gj4gtPKTWT6LdeVm
https://youtu.be/ynNsuyneTwo?si=gj4gtPKTWT6LdeVm
Rap god performance 🔥🔥
6:30 is all you need to watch onwards
Damn😢
This is the best live TV performance in the history of UK hip hop history could be the best in hip hop history
Ghettss🎉
Giggs verse so weak
Meekz sounded exactly like how he was on the track
these goosebumps from this art... this is it!!!!
No claps for Gheets…:( come on fam.
Banger !
Dave is the GOAT at miming guitar, seems to have fooled most people here
🔋🔋🔋
The greatest performance I’ve ever seen ❤️
too clutch!
Can’t walk in my shoes, got me risking a bunion! Vintage
Came back to watch this for the 70th time
Too crazy 🔥
i was doing the dishes and every time i turned around Dave had a different instrument
dave so freaking talented
The way Ghetts was preaching is phenemonal . Giggs did his thing idc what anyone says LISTEN TO THE CROWD!! and he does it so effortlessley
Won’t lie this probably the best artist out now
Amazing what hip hop and rap could be if you spit the truth and no lies. #dissesforthestreets
Poetry class!
Long live king Dave!!!
dave man he’s acctually different from any other rapper
Mais wesh
Anyone know where to find the tab for that guitar solo
Every once in awhile I come back to this video for therapy 😮‍💨
Sold more boxes than the post office 😮‍💨😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥
2:36 My favourite line
Incredible performance but what was up with those mimed guitar parts. Just credit the actual guitar player by sticking them on stage rather than having Dave tickle the strings with his thumb and screw his face like he’s going Hendrix mode
Wow ❤
All i gotta say is fire jhhhhhezzzzz
Did come through as gold 🪙
fk yes
Fire mode 🔥 on
After hearing "In the fire" many times and falling in love with it, I just searched for the other rappers that were with Dave on this song and I got redirected here.. This is truly amazing, these guys are so real. Respect!!! 🎉
One of the greatest performance ever.... Still On repeat  in 2023 🔂 mad love❤❤❤❤
Dave’s on a different wavelength 😊
One of the best to ever do it
even among all this flames this performance is so cold!
This is truly one of the most beautiful performances of I’ve seen
Still here keep coming back
Before I had money it was time I invested
Damn they dont censor tv in the UK or something 😂😂
Love that from Dave, mouthing EVERY lyric to all the other verses
Dave is a savage
Man managed to get the singing of Christianity, the toughness of the streets and the pain of the past in a song, Mad respect 🫡
So sick
fuckin fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome Even got Mrs Brown on the chorus
here again for this masterpiece performance❤
i cant forgive dave for not including the woman's voice at the beginning in the spotify version, it's so angelic
You have put the fire  or put down everywhere. Le rap UK est réellement présent !
What a load of crap. Anti gun talk from Fredo then fast forward his best track will be glorifying it. Giggs sounding as boring as ever 😴 all back up by what sound like a church choir. Nah, I'm not buying in to this rubbish.
Dave is alread in the top 5 rap artists ever for me. He is so mature and his lyrics are so touching and smart. His storytelling is on another level. Plus that every production is amazing.
You are the team GB
had to comment again, but god damn my boys a rockstar
puts every live rapper performance to shame. imagine rapping at a live concert.
I’ve been tried in the fire 🔥
That gospel is no joke
❤
DAVE U DA GOAAAT !!!!! (Fredo went so hard with dat verse too)
I watch these performance once a week at least, Dave will be the next Prince. Inspiring this performance and production x
I'm so moved ❤❤❤
Good damn! I like it!
One of the great moments in British music this century
Is mumsy still nursing?
dave really is a ROCKSTAR. one of one.
Dave is incredibly good fuck 😮
This choir is so freaking awesome 😊
Dave is like crooked I , you don't wanna him anywhere you on a track . Dave made these lads look Sunday league
Deepest voice a Girl could have
This lowkey the best song ever
Dave is annoyingly talented
This song draws me back every time ❤️
Why didn't I catch this when it dropped
She sounds like a man
Crying 2023
Santan Dave
Wow
Before i had money, it was time i invested ❤
#fredo
DAVE

I heard bullets sing higher than Mariah in choir Spent a lot of time trappin', now I'm tryna retire But this shit runs in my blood, and I'm the guy they require And these guns bring nothin' but prison and death, still All my niggas just admire the fire Bro squeeze and he miss, but we admire a trier Finesse king, you can never lie to a liar But Fred got the fire, I fire for days I gotta write them in my notes, they'll be ignitin' the page Grindin' on cold nights, puttin' light to the flame Now there's no flame that can melt the ice in my chain, yeah I really put the ice in rice for the 'caine Me and Santan, you won't see nothin' like this again That's my young boys again, on the glide with the flame I just really hope your block came with fire-escapes Before my entrance, I took the fire exit Tried and tested, about twenty times arrested Two times guilty, no comment, I guess they guessed it Couple time bail, no forensics This a Deezy pendant, I don't need a necklace We stay protected and connected It's the energies I'm blessed with And now they watchin' like Netflix, had me doin' next shit Tryna get rich, but what's rich? Took more losses than Boris I sold more boxes than the post-office Twenty-one in jail, it turned me so solid Why you think my vision sick, I changed the game in my brain And sold robotics If you fell in my fire, you probably roast on it Heat up the stove and put hope on it Cah they don't care 'bout our lives, I put my soul on it I'm done tryna be somebody to some nobodies I'm bein' so honest, and they don't know porridge If I get burnin' while I'm watchin', higher learnin' Guns bustin', tyres turnin', that's a Russian and a German That's your phone ringin', you can hear the beep You won't be saved by the bell when you hear the screech And it's so deep, open, ocean This man escapin' some shells they can barely see Me and bro raisin' hell, we gon' share the heat Now put us in the same cell, we gon' share the sleep Am I my brothers keeper (it's deeper) I'm my brothers leader (speaker) I'm the eldest The one who had to make a name so the bells ring So nobody would trouble my siblings in this whirlwind My older cousin wasn't known for nothin' Never had no one I could call, but I was old in somethin' I'm diggin' deep with this tool like I'm known for plumbin' Somethin' in your chest like it's Robitussin Word to arsonist, I burn all this I stood in front of all three dragons and heard "Dracarys" And now we're jumpin' out G-Wagons and murkin' parties Man are comin' out with these bangers and dirty dancin' Nobody puts baby in a corner I uplift my girl, like I'm Swayze in the water And if it's already written, maybe I'm the author So accustomed to the fire, I get shivers when I'm naked in the sauna How, many times have they mistaken me for Scorcher? I'm lookin' in the mirror, sayin' "Justin, just cool, huh" Send Ghetts downstairs and tell them "Just bring me water" And tell Ghetts I put somethin' in the formula I'm focused, I don't need to burn the kush This is Moses speakin' to the burnin' bush I stood in front of the fire and learned to cook Finished my verse and never heard a hook Riskiest numbers, this jungle, stick through your youngers He's hungry, picked off the fungus Kept humble, slipped him a hundred Yeah, lived in a dungeon Those AirMax, which nigga stung them?

Gets it past God level, his on an all new plane creating a new universe of Rap I tell ❤️‍🔥🧘
U.K’s Kanye West ( pardon the comparison, I’m speaking on artistry only) sorry for seeing this performance late but was amazing and “Elegant” (Dave voice) all in one!! Mawd ting dat t’bloodseed!!! 💣💥💣💥💣💥💥💥 … blessings king!! Flood the industry!!  #hiphop #mawdness #greatness
That was fire 🔥🔥
Dave till the end 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Dave and Burna Boy are my fav artist of all time...need a Collab album from them🔥😩🙌
This is insanely powerful!! What a bunch of absolute legends!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dave choose in the fire so he could perform with all his mates, what a man
Giggs did wonders
Soo everyone actually wanna sleep on ghetts n ignore the fact he actually owned this tune like it was his own n performed like no one’s business!! I always feel like he is slept on n people don’t take him. They just wanna follow n crowed n go for the Meeks n fredos just because every other younger does
Watching this live in jail, was a crazy experience 🔥🔥🔥
Keep coming back here ❤️
And that session singer ain't even got her name in the description
This is mad🔥
1st a big shout out to the artist all very talented people but when Zionist push mainstream ..your drill ..your and grime like they did gangster rap in the u.s. your youth are the ones manipulated to living that lifestyle like there's no other way to come up..They continue to reward a view to suppress the many from greatness.
I love all of you so much, so much talent and so beautiful!!
Masterpiece 👌
wish I could’ve seen this live😭
Best live performance ever. Hands down
This is the most beautiful UK performance I’ve seen!
Tooo Lit🔥🔥🔥❤️👏🏿

I look forward to dave's performances. He is true in everything that's said. Keep it up
anyone know meekz jacket or pants?!
Immense, even more so that 2 of the GOATs feature , only could have been made better by Kano featuring
Insaaaaaaaaaaneeeeeeeeee !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 no words for Dave man !
What a song 🔥
Amazing performace
Ghetts makes it effortless he's next level
Best rap performance till date 🔥
Ghetts went ham 🔥 absolute legend
“Tutankhamen there’s money in skeletons”🔥
Uk history that one jheeezzz
This my favorite live performance I’ve ever seen ong!  Watched it like a thousand times!
I loved the song but as a musician myself that plays guitar i loved the solo but hated the way it was played. The lack of vibrato just made me cover my ears. There is some technique he has to work there, but the solo was well "written".  The choir was amazing very pleasent for my ears! Great job, the solo itself was great but need a little more practise!💪💪
Best ever
fire rises
Mah mans out of this world w this one
Meekz is a true performer
The Brits never seen a performance like this.
Dave is a young Legend
Ghetts 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥  🔥 🔥 🔥 was the best on this

Meekz

Thank you Dave ❤
Dave Knows Art... Nah Dave is Art!

I live in GA United States. I started listening to UK grime in 2016. Put everyone in my city onto it. I knew it would be the next thing. This is beautiful.
Best performance ever
Nobody speaks about how much Ghetts ate here. He absolutely killed his verse it was flawless what a legend.
Amazing young man...Bless him!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Giggs getting the respect he deserves with arguably the loudest reaction what a man
that moment 0:54 , unlucky

Ghetts man.. My guy poured his heart out 🔥🔥🔥
Dave you’re unreal 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unforgettable 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goosebumps man! Goosebumps
realised that the song 'In the fire' is about how everyone has been tried in hell and we have all been tempted by the devil but if you keep on going, then you will end up in Hell so we have to be careful as Christians.
Didn't know Dave is a multi-instrumentalist
Epic

The best to ever do it
Look at Freddo holding his cheeks like wtf 😭😈
Fucking sick performance right here one of the best I’ve ever seen on the brits
👑👑👑👑👑
Meekz has the sickest flow
Dave is inspirational to the nation 🇬🇧 🔥
Ain’t gonna lie this was just another level. Would have been good to have seen Kano on here also
Waw!
🇧🇷
Giggs was the best
Santana Dave be making Nigerians Proud 🇳🇬🇳🇬... man's got so much talent 🚀🚀
Dave can you play the Brits again? Yeah but I need two famethrowers.   Such an amazing performance and performer.
This performance should go down in history 🔥
Giggs part was sooo boring and dead
Damn even Giggs killed it. Not often I have said that.
Amazing performance 🎭 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
i never knew Dave was a true artist until today...real talent! 🔥👌🏻
Talented line up, but Ghetts deserves some studio time after his performance. Barz!
nah UK rappers or Grimers cant do SOUL.  leave that too the Americans.  Yall keep doing the Fast electronic synth dancehall beats
Dave better be immortal because I’ll probably lose all hope if he passes
This was amazing.. just got round to seeing this.. Why no one cheer for Ghetts coming out tho.?
What guitar does he own
The fact that Fredo swore and use explicits knowing he'd get fined is amazing to me lol, everyone else covered up or improvised their lyrics.
Gibbs's verse and flow 🔥
You just can't hate Dave ❤️

Hey I’m not like being Karen or anything I love Dave so much he’s my favorite artist but I didn’t know they could swear at the BRITS? Or is it bleeped out on live television? Idk I was just wondering cause when Dave performed black at the BRITS he didn’t swear but I’m just wondering. Best artist, best performance, one of the most talented artists right now much love from the states!! 🇺🇸

Used to watch this for Ghetts. Now I watch it for the woman in the beginning. Me and my 3.5yo doing up baritone 😆
When giggs walks out! Yeahhh boi
America…. Take notes
One of the greatest performances I have seen, Dave n the artists are greatly appreciated. This is why Dave is one of my favorites
we need to hear a collaboration Album with Kano and Dave. Y might instantly see see an upgrade to what they have already set. City street art might even move with it  ;;))
Dave talented af bruv, Playing Guitar and Piano too?!! Damn 🔥
This performance though!!!! Wow!! Ridiculous!!!! Best ive seen! Guitar piano producer is there anything this man can't do
Legend 🔥 first time listening since the brit awards 🤯💪💪
Humble at the same time fearless ruthless Dave 🔥
The way meekz comes in
Dave ft Quavo 👇 https://youtu.be/OmrMuDzreic
amazing
Dave’s chain round his neck is inspired by a painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Her paintings often reflected her life experiences and dealt with the pain she endured. One of her quotes: “I paint self portraits because I am so often Alone…”  Dave is such a meticulous artist👏
This is so pure, he let us comment, its a concert so we can comment like were in a crowd it’s beautiful, other songs are solo listens, man has RANGE
UK really is bringing the best music out these days
Ghetts is so fucking sick
That was epic levels 🔥🙌🏿🔥
https://youtu.be/AkmFU-UAaRI
Rapping, electric guitar, reg guitar AND on the piano. I love it!
He Nick Jonas'd the guitar solo, but everything was still fire.
2022
Every time!!!! The hairs on the back of my neck rise when I hear this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Always love the way Giggs sounds like he somehow found his way onto stage and doesn't care he's there, don't know how he sounds so good lmao
10/10 Performance. Power. Presence. Clarity. Not one wasted moment.
i watch this anytime i come on youtube. UK's GOAT rappers
This is such a mental song.. I remember playing it, no mentions of features, then got hit with that cheeky 1,2.. still one of my fav songs of all time.. gonna learn to rap every word. 🔥🔥🔥
How fucking talented is that! Best song for me on album, yea we all been tested, but all them man there know gods the answer bless them up!
Also just have to respect Dave for bringing on this many Black artists
Ghetts has thatkano type flow
anyone got tabs for the solo? lol
This song's beautiful, words cannot communicate the amount of respect I have for these artists. Never stop.
That was an amazing performance! Madd!
Cringe
Santan the gang advisor
💥🔥
MEEKZ

What hoodie is fredo wearing
Fammm this coming like a legendary tune
Lit
Wretch was my number 1 GOAT with no competing but Dave is creeping up so close 🔥🔥🔥
The goosebumps are mad with this one
I don’t know what the hell they’re talking about but I love the background
Superb. Stunning work.
I think he just defined why we are held back on every level but that just makes the come up sweeter 😎🔥
Ghetts Verse is actually so nice
Sick man, Just sick i never heard of these guys but shit!! Shit is sick
Meekz went from a cell to a standout performance at the BRITs in 3 years. THERE ARE LEVELS TO THIS, DONE DEEZY PROUD!
Ghetts verse is a mad ting
Some of the back ground singers can sing better than most artists 😩
💯😍🤟🔥
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
⚡️
I listened to this in school
Dave is a GENIUS. this was soooo good 🤍
Finished my verse and never heard a hook
Verse of the year goes to Ghetts, bars like his life depends on it
what a song and what a performance!
This is the best performance I've ever seen. Dave your amazing 👏🏽 Poetic Kings 👑 Well done to you all!!
This music is so spiritual
Load of bollocks
🔥❤️
Can we just appreciate how Fredo kept every verse Uncensored thats a real
The guitar playing was abit corny though especially when he’s going off pitch but good try !!
This is my fav out of the album and also the other song “system”  .. I know he pushed the clash song with stormzy
Really he deserved album of the year. For me nothing topped it. Truly an outpour of emotion and deep thought. But KSI's latest album deserved a nomination
Bro there should have been more cheers for all these guys. There all legendary man
THIS is the best Brits performance. It's truly above average grime or drill. Dave is the artist putting the UK at the top and on the map. Forever pushing boundaries. It's great to me since this is one of the songs off his album I'm least familiar with. UK and black excellence. When I first watched this on TV I  couldn't believe what I was seeing
ay yo modie watchu doin fam
Electric guitar took me TF out! It was already a 10 before that!
What a man❤️
Thanks to Top Boy I’ve found so many good UK artists and Dave is definitely at the top of my list. Salute all the way from Baltimore Maryland ‼️🔥
Dave is the Kanye of drill
64yrs old loved rap hip hop r@b since the start but this song excels sends shivers through these old bones love the British stuff you kids are top drawer take care young men

BIG DAVE>>>>>>
fredo spazzed
Calm music
Big kano vibes from ghetts verse
Ghetts and giggs such og’s showing how it’s done
Dave has be a man of many tallentd
Santan can never be topped but gigs 😍
0:57 when it gets good
Giggs been in the game too long to be cuffing the mic like that . Messed up the sound quality of his verse .
*MY GOD my goodnesswhat a  multi talented artist is Dave is. also he just raps straight facts* there was *NOT AN OUNCE OF A LIE IN ANYTHING ANY OF THEM SAID it was all entirely truth and needs to be worked on.*  *but there's fat chance of anything's improving for the working class of people of colour in this country when the fucking Tories are in charge* *the worst of the worst are the Tories* they act like they're good people like they're holier Than Thou *THEY ARE JUST CRIMINALS IN SUITS are the Tories* *Fuck'em they ain't no better than the supposed* "thugs" "Crooks" and "criminals" they look down upon. Get out of here with that bullshit.
Wow Dave is multi talented! Really impressed with all of it! Next level shit this is, how can you not like this.
THE BEST
Absolutely smashed it out of the park.
Location big🎵🎶but  he guna be running things in every location for a very long best artist  musician these days  in my eyes with out doubt 👌
This tune is 🔥 u got to love it favourite tune Dave the legiond!!! take a bow👌🎶🎵🎧
What a performance 🤯. Different gravy
This right here need 100’s of millions of views
Giggs… it’s a no from me. Sounds like he woke up 10 mins before
fredo is a beast !!!
Why didn’t ghetts get a crowd reaction tho smh
satanic ritual pathetic
Dave 🔥
Dat guitar duo 🎸 🔥
Shit gives me goosebumps everytime, goat shit !!
Sitting here studying, grinding in cold nights, Doctor Me May 2023, God be with me
Full force of the flame x x x
This is insane. One of the best performance I’ve ever seen. From the vocalist to the instrumentals. Alllllll 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
The women in the start! WOW.   some voice!
🔥
Dave always give me chills when he take the mic this guy is pure raw talent love u bro ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Black excel-lence
dave should release some music with Konyikeh, she has the vocals to produce the same type of background/secondary music as most of his tracks
there was absolutely no need for the intro to be that good. those vocals were insane
My best song for the year beautiful song oh oh
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that choir?! SO powerful. Everything about this performance was amazing.
"Did you come through?" that's the question.
M HUNCHO FLOWS SO MUCH BETTER THEN ALL THESE GUYS 💯 EVEN SOME ONE DEAF COULD AFFIRM DAT
Anyone who's been following and is still not proud of Dave and his rise, needs a whole personality check.   Remember him rolling round Streatham as a teenager, here is hitting God-level performer. Best lyricist by a mile, multi-instrumentalist, producer, ambition and talent to match. This guy is doing us all so so proud.
recognize real

Giggs best ft
Inspiration the best music
Ghettz is deep at dropping lol
Meeks go !!!!
I wish I saw this live. It’s so powerful. All great artists but Dave has such a drive and passion to what he does. He is going down in history with the greats
Goated
All-stars
Meekz went in 🔥
Absolute banger, massive props to Dave for learning the guitar and putting on such an incredible performance so quickly, young legend on the scene
Fredo didn't get the memo about no cursing 🤣
What a croc of shit. You aren't living in America, get real for fuck sake.  As a poser if this country that faired your life, education was invaded like the Ukraine?  Would you stand and fight or run away? Just don't get these 'Bad Boys"   that want to be street. It's all bullshit,  Ice, bash the lot.  Big boy rapper go to trinity garden's in Tower Hill boi See where My grandfather's name is etched in steel.  All war is wrong and don't try to tell me these know the score  Would they fight on the frontline?
Real Rap!
Dave ❤🔥😩
Fire and Ice
FU
You could hear the emotion in Dave's voice
My favourite artist, and also the best alive
This young man is so talented like Jamie  Fox
This was crap compared to the Black performance. The truth is, such is his popularity, he is no longer judged, it’s DAVE!!!!!!!!
go go save all of u
I loved this amazing x
wow
Dave is rare... whaaaaaat!!!🤯
Fantastico
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dave would you be up for a peace march to the Ukraine,and perform a free concert for the people of this conflict? I'm at your side and up for the march?
Dave has absolutely been listening to some 70s floyd and I love it
Dave generational 🥶🔥
Bro Dave is so underated man, should be along with the top artists bro
Does anyone know what jumper fredo was wearin its hard cant lie
Fredo is on fire 🔥
Raised in Streatham, supports Man United ... proper South London yout that! Dave, jokes aside my young bro, I'm happy to see you happy.
Dave is MAAAAAAD. all his lines are him spitting. That fight or flight line to start with🔥🔥  He says he's got killers with him and that was literal. Half the lineup have had murder cases.
Dave, you are a bloody legend!!!! You slapped me really hard with this one!!!! I can't believe it!!! Bloody hell!
SUCH POWER!!!!!! THE OPENING...WOW!!! I LOVE THIS WOMAN, I LOVE THE VOICE!!!
SUCH POWER!!!!!! THE OPENING...WOW!!! I LOVE THIS WOMAN, I LOVE THE VOICE!!!
SUCH POWER!!!!!! THE OPENING...WOW!!! I LOVE THIS WOMAN, I LOVE THE VOICE!!!
Dave badest highest confam
Like the 100th time coming back to this 🔥
The best live performance of all time on UK soil.
Meekz sounds EXACTLY like Maroc from Country Dons.
🔥 firee
Goosebumps! What a performance! A true voice of a generation 🙏🏻
That women sang like a man lol
I wish I saw this live. It’s so powerful. All great artists but Dave has such a drive and passion to what he does. He is going down in history with the greats
Fucking terrible - except for the woman at the beginning who can actually really sing and choir which is great. Otherwise just a load of whingey little boys
Man this is ridiculous.  Such a great performance. Dave just plays everything, raps every bar from start to finish...true artist
They don’t know you Santan like they should but mark my words your time is yet to come and make sure someone is filming your rise on the side ( like Kanye) . You’re going to do greater things
The crowd reaction to fredo vs everyone except Dave gets me every time
Fredo is just ghetto feel so happy for him not begging it but he is one person that does really deserve to stay at the top because he is been from the bottom and got to the top on his own and made it before the music now his straight ghetto
Most talented man on earth rn no 🧢
Said it when it came out and I’ll say again. Everyone on this track went crazy, but Ghetts crushed it
Holy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We have nothing to worry about in the States if this is what's hot over there...Guitar playing a beginner but not bad...listen 2 Jay-Z  and other new artists we have and be blown away (Adele is the only artist/winner that has done excellent here) deserving so...a real singer/artist
that woman from the gospel choir in the beginning was nuts
For Jamal
Meeks ownes this shit .
His guitar skills are better than most in actual guitar "bands" around today... Nice one fella!!!
This guy is too talented😤
🤟✌️💕
This is LEGENDARY 🙌💯
“ I could have been deported, that’s the definition of a flight or fight” 🔥🔥
NAH NAH NAH DAVE FRED AND MEEKZ AYYY THIS HAS TO BE HARD BRO  nah man... the bars were hard... but they came on some sunday morning church beat bro smh  😞
How average was this…. Shocking.
This is fire on so many levels…                      Massive respect to Dave
I stood in front of all three dragons and heard dracarys
The amount of times I come back to watch this
best performance in brits history. hands down, everyone shelled it. Meekz and Ghetts brought next level energy, ments how hard they went compared to the stuidio version of the song.
sorry superbowl half time show what ?
Meekz absolutely fucking killed that
Meekz was 🔥🔥🔥
P

Dave... How do you own one of the most common names and make it yours... Dave did it!!!! True musician
i come back to watch this all the time. goosebumps fr
Ghetts is another type of lyricist! "This is moses speaking to the burning bush"
Dave can play the guitar?
This guys the definition of artist MULTI TALENTED 💯💯
OH HELL YEA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like rap but these lyrics are just silly.
Super Dope!
Now the bots have come to yt 🤦‍♂️
You’re star 💫 bro
This is serious!
Epic.
Dave is honestly such a great artist.
Dave plays instruments, talented poet!
That singer has a deep ass voice. And y do the rappers have such low energy ?
Meekz and Fredo need a song together
His guitar wasn’t properly in tune. Also his solo skills need improving but it’s alright because I didn’t even know he played. Apart from that, sick
Had no idea he was an instrumentalist. Made me want to give him a go. Anyone know of any up beat stuff of his?
Dave telling our story, no apologies.
Dave is literally the GOAT
Super talented! one of the best in the UK.
🐐
Way too much fire just to back it up🔥🔥
Electrifying 🎵oh my nerves🙌❤️💺
Oh my god he can play instruments too
Brilliant performance! Big up!
Best BRITS performance of all time, period.
The guitar solo was awful.
Am from Kenya and man dave is the most talented in the whole grime scene💥💥💥
Each time the crowd went wild for each artist… beautiful
That was good
What hoodie is fredo wearing?
Wow seeing Meekz on a stage like this is inspirational shit man

love it, simple
I need this on iTunes please!!!
He talked about learning how to play the guitar few months ago he's playing like he did this last 4yrs man
Man this love blazing as fire,much ❤ to all black yutes!
BRO WHAT!!! 🔥
Unlearn all you've been taught to enslave you. History never stopped, because time never stops, but evil people distort and conceal it. The Truth will set you free.
BIG UP to all the production team on this as well. FLAWLESS
Giggs kinda let this performance down a bit, too lazy with it haha. Otherwise this was on point!
Nobody puts baby in the corner...
Gyllene läxa ovärderlig!!!
DAVE IS TALENT
Dave chose music over law at uni. It was only right he made it in the music game.
Rammstein want there stage set back!
Dave........ Thank You! Ghetts man!! Amen!
🔥🔥🔥
Ghetts is fucking hard man. The UK Jay Z
Wow 😮 this is what you call telent raise a glass for these lot 🤙🍷🍸🍻

PETITION TO MAKE THIS THE OFFICIAL VIDEO
Is Giggs being carried by the culture or is his spot solidified?
performance on steroids man damn🥵
Dave is the only rapper who is showing music ability! playing instruments like that wow! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Hello, I have something important to tell you  The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
I love this man😩😩😍
No but Meekz 👏🏾

This has the edge on the studio version without a doubt
thats hard asf
Dave showcasing his talents from acoustic guitar to piano to rock guitar... although I wasn't sure in the end whether it was him or the other fella pulling the strings.  I think it was him but got me wondering
This performance is better than the actual track.
🔥 young and gifted #AllStars
Dave 🎸🎶skill madddddd🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
Yeh, that Adele record was good and more mainstream i guess but in the UK how is the best hip hop album not just the best album in the UK. I get it, white women love Adele but cmon, this is a once in a generation artist
WOW... I'm speechless... What a performance.
He was playing guitar just like he was playing piano on the other one. Sorta.
Yo I want what Giggs wearing, that attire looks 🔥. Grown man wear
Tutankhamen there’s money in skeletons!
I watched the halftime show which was sick. But this is like the UK scene showing that they’re sick. Amazing musicianship and talent. Proud to be apart of this scene. Amazing artists producers and performers.
This guy is so talented it's crazy
I wish I had children as amazing as you brodders. So much pride and love. M. O. M 👆👑
Dave!! what a talented visionary you are King 👑 this is epic one for the history books. Ghetts Verse 🔥🔥🔥
Fredo in the scene

Dave is a LEGEND
Performance gave me goosebumps 💯
Dave Hendrix!
One of the best performance I've watched Too much love from Nigeria
This man is a different breed to bless the UK music scene
New meaning to mans not hot
Growing up in Gorton. Proud of Meekz man
Better than the 2022 Super Bowl halftime show
🖤🖤🖤
23 years old ya know feels like he has been around for generations
It was such a moment! So amazing to watch An entire stage of Black excellence shut down the O2 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 was a really  amazing performance even more so when u know Dave only learned how to play guitar few weeks ago! Nothing but love 💕
Meekz manny
That's a Health and Safety Officer's nightmare. I mean, Polyester gowns?!
Salute!👌🏾🖤
For the culture 🔥🔥🔥 I’m so fudging proud
1.36.  Just look at the absolute passion and energy in the performance there.   Disgusting
0:22 this bit is soooo good
Respect for Dave went up big time after this, they all smashed it!! not to forget the choir and band members 🤟🏻
This man is the ultimate performer at this point what can't he do
Epic!
You call this music this is the most horrible music fire. Only morons and singers without talent call this singing… only in America //?
The crowd when Giggs come on tho 👏
That solo is awfully bad. Even close to Lil Wayne's one string solo. It shows to what level people accept "live performances" or "talent". There's no talent into that guitar playing. I'm not judging the song but pls for fuck sake, stop going crazy for an awful performance...
just 4 months, Dave ?? you nailed ! 🔥
Dave is absolutely reaching that Andre 3000 level here. True Artistry amazing moment in music.....LEGENDARY
Had a chance to perform one of the impactful tunes and basically just chose some "bring the mandem through" type ting for the connections and industry ratings.  Worse song on the album as far as all the others man could have chose. Just to put on people with dead verses. Literally only Ghetts stepped up on the original.  Wasted opportunity tbh
Time to unite One Love Selassie I
Outstanding performance 👊🏽
You people worship celebs but when I see these rappers really outside they moving anxious and wanna be extra cool lol
Fruity rappers
Dave was made for this industry, super talented well done King ❤
I was sat there thinking “Daves kinda holding that guitar a bit weird at the end there” then suddenly flames shoot out the end and I understand why
*It's sounds crazy* ❣❣
32 years of age and this is definitely the best brits I’ve ever seen!!! Big up Meekz manny 🔥👏🏆
ayy he mentioned about Poland <3 what a legend
This Brit awards performance is going down in history
Can’t wait to go see Dave live new album tour like 2 weeks away I can’t wait
meekz duppied
Love the gospel. But man not digging the rhymes sorry. Just cringe. It’s all been done before and better
🔥🔥🔥
Never thought I’d see the day Giggs performs in a double breasted blazer 🙌🏾
This was weird 😆 hella awkward
Miss the old Dave
I saw this man at lowlands, his energie, the way that het interacts with the audience. It shows a lot of musical intelligence.
Heyy can you guys check my beats real quick??
DAVE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ghetts comes out n just destroys the song. Not many beat Dave on his own tracks
This is the best things I’ve seen in my life.
She got a deeper voice than me
Giggs could become the UKs Snoop. General tings
I got killers wiv me ..and they love me (looks round) 🔥
Its been on loop since the brits 🔥
I was getting goosebumps when I heard this
Dave is actually a DIFFERENT BREEEED, doesnt stop surprising everyone, guitar solo's now?
Giggs looking like a boss

My God guide you and blessed on your path !
If a rapper like dave playing the guitar like that isn't an inspiration... I don't know what is fqirplay dave you fucking legend
super banger
David, thank you for this bro. It was necessary for the culture. Giggs & Ghetts had to perform at the BRITs one day. You topped the Black performance, which at the time was the greatest BRITs performance of all-time.
when ghetts came in tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Young Kings 👑
Dave is clear !!!!!
Hey youtube, I'm converting all of the music I like into mp3, I'm so done with your shit adds you shit website

Daves so talented man singing, rapping, song writing, beat maker, guitar & piano player what a true inspiration for anyone young or old to look up to 👏
Dave was legendary, Ghetts was simply sensational, everyone delivered, this was easily the best brits performance of all time.
Best rap performance I’ve yet to see!!
SUCH A FUCKING TALENT!!!!
DAVE is so intelligent, mature and a great heart. Im so glad to witness one of the grestest artists of a generation.

All of them did amazing but Giggs' part was insane
Dave = one dimensional flow  Ghetts = diffffffffffffrent!!!!!!!!!!
Dave is a gift.
Ghetts is toooo cold with it
"Tutankhamen thats money 💰 in skeletons"💀 🤣🤣
Probably watching this for the 20th time ,since it came out.🤯
I love it great music , but why he had to pretending to play the instrumentals (fake guitar , fake piano , fake electric guitar)
Took more Losses than Boris 🤣🤣🤧 meekz has wordplay 🤌🤌
FIRE

🔥🎉Amazing all 💖🍀🙏🏽👍🏾✌🏽

SANTAN!!!🔥🔥🔥
This guy cannot to any wrong in my eyes 👌🏾
Best description of the fireballs was by a commentator who said Man was throwing “Double Adukins” only Streetfighter fans would gerrit:)))
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
gg in the chat
Dave is easily one of the best rap artists of all time!!
This was actually the best ever live performance I’ve seen
Doing It Stealthy makes me happy in a way that no woman ever could... btw I'm single and so alone, please message me.
Everything in my life changed when I started listening to Doing It Stealthy by Oloff.
Doing It Stealthy helps me to process my feelings about 9/11.
What do you call a man who hasn't heard Doing It Stealthy by Oloff? A sad loser.
I listen to Doing It Stealthy when I'm experiencing existential dread. It makes it worse but... I just can't stop.
Doing It Stealthy is one of those songs that makes you ask.... why did God create us? What happens after we die?
I listen to Doing It Stealthy by Oloff whenever I need therapy. Yeah, I could pay $300 an hour for some college clown to tell me what to feel, or I could just smash great big fucking coconuts on my head and listen to my favourite song over and over again.
🔥🔥🔥👑✊🏿
Santan took it to another level. This is a trademark performance in British Music History 🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Can we give it up for the girl killing intro vocals ? 🔥🔥🔥
Fredddddddd
I hate to say it but this just shows what I’ve been saying for 20 years! Giggs is shit on a rap beat! IMO and only my opinion I believe he scammed the game 🤣 his bars are basic, flow is boring and delivery is whack!! Nursery rhymes 👀🙈I remember everyone use to bang talking the hardest and I use to laugh and say what is this shit!! Throw on some “Page” leave giggs alone 👊🏼 Cant knock his workrate but not enough substance to him! Just shows tho what sheep we are as a people!
The best to ever do it 🐐❤️
🔥🔥💥❤️🥰
https://youtu.be/Fo4SnFc0FuA
This performance ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Wish Giggs put more oomph in his part. It felt too monotone. But that guitar solo and flamethrower turns this to a 11/10.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the best collaboration ever frfr big up these legendary MC's
Live audio quality is exceptional, very cool song and visuals. Well done!
Dave’s really on a different level, true artist

Bro brought out the avengers
whos the singer in the beggining?
I know I got religion I belong to the laws and crew You see we fought when we get happy That's the way we Christian do Oh (Have you been tried-) Have you been tried in that fire? I heard bullets sing higher than Mariah in choir Spent a lot of time trappin', now I'm tryna retire But this shit runs in my blood, and I'm the guy they require And these guns bring nothin' but prison and death, still All my niggas just admire the fire Bro squeeze and he miss, but we admire a trier Finesse king, you can never lie to a liar But Fred got the fire, I fire for days I gotta write them in my notes, they'll be ignitin' the page Grindin' on cold nights, puttin' light to the flame Now there's no flame that can melt the ice in my chain, yeah I really put the ice in rice for the 'caine Me and Santan, you won't see nothin' like this again That's my young boys again, on the glide with the flame I just really hope your block came with fire-escapes Before my entrance, I took the fire exit Tried and tested, about twenty times arrested Two times guilty, no comment, I guess they guessed it Couple time bail, no forensics This a Deezy pendant, I don't need a necklace We stay protected and connected It's the energies I'm blessed with And now they watchin' like Netflix, had me doin' next shit Tryna get rich, but what's rich? Took more losses than Boris I sold more boxes than the post-office Twenty-one in jail, it turned me so solid Why you think my vision sick, I changed the game in my brain And sold robotics If you fell in my fire, you probably roast on it Heat up the stove and put hope on it Cah they don't care 'bout our lives, I put my soul on it I'm done tryna be somebody to some nobodies I'm bein' so honest, and they don't know porridge If I get burnin' while I'm watchin', higher learnin' Guns bustin', tyres turnin', that's a Russian and a German That's your phone ringin', you can hear the beep You won't be saved by the bell when you hear the screech And it's so deep, open, ocean This man escapin' some shells they can barely see Me and bro raisin' hell, we gon' share the heat Now put us in the same cell, we gon' share the sleep Am I my brothers keeper (it's deeper) I'm my brothers leader (speaker) I'm the eldest The one who had to make a name so the bells ring So nobody would trouble my siblings in this whirlwind My older cousin wasn't known for nothin' Never had no one I could call, but I was old in somethin' I'm diggin' deep with this tool like I'm known for plumbin' Somethin' in your chest like it's Robitussin Word to arsonist, I burn all this I stood in front of all three dragons and heard "Dracarys" And now we're jumpin' out G-Wagons and murkin' parties Man are comin' out with these bangers and dirty dancin' Nobody puts baby in a corner I uplift my girl, like I'm Swayze in the water And if it's already written, maybe I'm the author So accustomed to the fire, I get shivers when I'm naked in the sauna How, many times have they mistaken me for Scorcher? I'm lookin' in the mirror, sayin' "Justin, just cool, huh" Send Ghetts downstairs and tell them "Just bring me water" And tell Ghetts I put somethin' in the formula I'm focused, I don't need to burn the kush This is Moses speakin' to the burnin' bush I stood in front of the fire and learned to cook Finished my verse and never heard a hook Riskiest numbers, this jungle, stick through your youngers He's hungry, picked off the fungus Kept humble, slipped him a hundred Yeah, lived in a dungeon Those AirMax, which nigga stung them? Can't walk in my shoes, you could be riskin' a bunion The government's twisted I cover this shift to cover this Christmas Forget them old friends, I'm done with those bitches They color coded my brothers and sisters Run the rhythm, you're a brother, but you run the rhythm Try accusin' me of colorism Blinded 'cause you look at me with tunnel vision I was fallin', but I've gone and risen Is this nigga trusty or Sideshow Bob when he's creepin' on Krusty? Streets keep me tusslin', people disgust me Racist disease, that shit that disgust me Don't touch me on the streets with the sweeper 'Cause the streets pretty dusty And I've always got love for genuine people that bust me Santan and the gang advisor, I'ma check him out, I'm a analyzer She was callin' me an antagonizer Let me sanitize, where's the sanitizer? (Jheeze) Just flutter by, he said "Giggs can you handle this?" He said "Float like a butterfly" I bring truth, but they love a lie Plans, I'm the man you should run 'em by In the fire, been tried Affected the way I been wired inside You can hide or glide I could've been deported That's the definition of a "Fight or flight" You can type all you like I know about homeless Immigration, they took me from my mums arms Fuck a gun charge, two swords, I'm a ronin Błaszczykowski, I'm tryna score with the Polish Pain in my eyes, plans of me stayin' in the guide With a vision of this changin' my life Crimes on the rise, hates on the rise Feel like everythin' but my mum's pay's on the rise "Did you come through?" that's the question Affording a burner was never mans problem Adoption, we couldn't find homes for the weapons By the station, we got polls, no election In the fire, been tested Before I had money, it was time I invested Nothin' change, still time I invest in Watch-game delicate, Tutankhamun, there's money in skeletons All I gotta do is point, they're gonna sever his head And tell- that we're better as friends Nights that I can't remember with some people I could never forget Caza Cruz, you could bet a Nusr-et Don't make me call a young gunner in the back of a PED Slappin' a lead, civilians grabbin' your friends There's chaos on the main road They called choppers and PEDs All because of some shit that you said I got killers with me (killers with me) And they love me, they make a mans heart stop The shit you find horrifyin' gets laughed off I'm like Meekz, bro, I won't stop, can't stop Yeah, it's kinda different when the fire's what you start from Have you been tried in the fire? (Hot) Have you been tried in the fire? (Yeah) Have you been tried in the fire? (Oh yeah) Tell me (did you come to) Did you come to Have you been "Do your research to travel Don't see, don't really see the corners of the world  That are alien to you, really do interest you And you know, 'cause in due process then you'll meet new people And then those people will tell you new stories Then you become a voice for the voiceless I mean, you should ask Daniel, really, truly, where he goes to find himself 'Cause I don't know anything, I'm just speculatin' More importantly for you and your family You then get to ask the questions and answer the questions About where you were made Like "Where you come from, where you're goin, London, Lagos, LA" The journey is the film" Source: LyricFind
Daniels friends in the bible were in the fire, heated moments which make us angry is like being in fire. These moments can shape our mentality and attitude towards others. Spirituality is important to keep focused on what is important and is a cooling system for when we are in fires.
If this had Kano then it would be all my best of British
Dave your the best my g 👍
dave on god levels
ma brother
Legit thought that was a man singing
I think any random person from the audience could probably rap better and bring more euthasim then Giggs honestly.
Meekz kills it
Who's doin it like him mann
Most talented person going…can play 2 kinds of guitar, can play piano, best lyricist, and is a very good actor
Ghetts is so sooo way underrated his verse was clearly easily blow meekz frado dave out the water his the best UK rapper easily the intellectual of this man is different class.. Devil. Kano. Old asher d lol I cud name a few more but that's just my opinion peace and respect to all
Dave is Goated🔥🔥🔥
"feel like everything but my mums pays on the rise" shit, that bit was deep.
I love that they’re rapping live over a P.A. track
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥
Brits was mad this year
Fully thought that was a bloke singing at first 😂
Ghetts&Giggs only missing chip 💣
Nobody does it better than Dave🤝

Rise Sir Dave! His talent is ridiculous, know people there’s bare man in all hoods who have the potential to be on his level. They just never get a real chance to make it! Love what he did with playing the guitar...showed old Skool rock n roll musicians new Skool, black musicians are taking over! ✊🏾❤️💪🏾

This is coldest performance ever. This man is an absolute living legend👑⛑️
Wow he really just shredded a guitar at the end i am amazed, well done lads very touching performance.
Ghetts 🔥
Giggys voice is low key hot 😳
I knew this was a gem the moment I heard it when the album dropped.
Powerful ... I got goosebumps watching this man.

Ghetts looking like a fire fighter in that outfit 😂
Only thing this is missing is kano
I coulda filled the last gap with this fire that I wrote but damn the revolution finally televised ✨✨✨✨✨
That guitar goes crazyyyyy
Each time I listen a Dave song, I either cry, and feel all the songs. Real bomboclaat poet🔥🔥🔥
This was nuts- legendary
Wow🔥🔥
The UK need to show more love for Ghetts man. They have no idea how legendary he is to the scene.
God bless dave for bringing back pop smoke to sing the intro!
Hell of a perfomance!!!
When the live is better than the music video
Going to see dave at the 3arena in Dublin in like 3 weeks time .. and this has made me even more excited
Dave is a legend man ❤️

The Brit awards was so very boring this year except for Dave performance  ..Real vibes!he wiped everyone else out including Adele!
What jacket is meekz wearing ? Anyone can help??
SANTAN 💙😎

Such an electric performance!
Best linkup in British music history, across all genres!
This is crazy! An instant classic for the people of UK to always come and watch 🔥 also the world
Can’t lie I’m gunna go listen to walk in the park
I'm absolutely speechless, completely awe struck 😳 this is hands down the most incredible Brit awards performance I've ever seen and I personally don't feel it could ever be topped. They all deserve their 100% respect and appreciation where its due 👏🏼 but Dave is in a league of his own an absolute talented masterclass genius. He will go down in history as one of the UKs very best top tier 👌🏼
Giggs "You can't walk in my shoes, You'll be risking a Bunion" 💥💥💥
These guys should stay together and be the UK Wu Tang Clan
That ghetts verse thou 🌡
Bro we still waiting for you to come to Lagos
This came like some hell slayer concert. It’s lit 🔥
Meekz enters this track differently!!!!!
What an epic performance..! 🔥🔥🔥

crazy ! super talented that girl sounded like a man tbh but
SANTAN 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Meekz my donny
If you can't see or hear the level of absurdity on stage then just enjoy it to your hearts content 😁
The whole performance was a damn masterpiece, but let's not sleep on those opening vocals - that woman had a crystal clear, powerful as hell voice. Who is she!?
This song is special! Did you come through as pure gold even after hearing “dracarus”?  Big up the mandem ❤️
GOD DAMN WHAT A PERFORMANCE! I got chills when Dave started rapping, his delivery was amazing. And of course the guitar solo...FIRE 🔥
Santannn!!!!👊🏿💥

Government plants all celebrity's are fake masks wwe scripted lifestyle made up playing each other masks wwe fake government plants
I love it when rappers use physical instrument like the guitar or drums etc. Let’s appreciate Dave giving us a full guitar solo at the end 🔥
This is what u call a tip top performance. Amazing🔥

for meekz to step out like this with these names shows he's up there
Absolutely wonderful performance 🎭 🔥🔥🔥 🐐
Me coming back every day to seethis iconic people 👏👏👏
Quality performance and sound! (Shout out to camera peeps for getting the best shot too) but it’s silly how my first thought 💭’did it smell like burning or fire from the audience or on stage 😳👀does fire even have a smell?’ Either way this performance was something else 🤯😱I wasn’t ready for the fire in the guitar tho🥵😳👀 i would grade that they burnt the whole assignment paper and school down including the opp students schools , teachers all been toasted by this single too.  Everyone just absorb 😶‍🌫️it bc it’s only every now and then we get music of this intellectual and diverse quality. I cannot get enough of this song I listen &every time I notice something else that I clearly missed before it’s long enough to really deep the lyrics and deep your situation in a relatable manner but not overly emotional 🤯😱it’s mind blowing stuff for me so I am learning& taking it in it’s great word play and Why am I telling my whole opinion in the comments like anyone even asked😭 .
Giggs the feat king does it again, guess the bunion bar was a reference too his legendary features he has done, they all went in on this one Ghetts brought that kano flow to the show, Fredo did his thing and so did Meekz and Dave set it all up...... Bless
Bro wow  Breathtaking performances  Big up all  One love people
Santan Dave is so clear man. So inspirational I
So they have sold their soals well done 👍
What a performance!!
PUT THIS ON SPOTIFY RN THIS BE 10X BETTER THAN THE NORMAL
Took me by surprise his guitar skills but then again he always full of talent
yo that was maddd big up to dave giggs ,ghetts.fredo and meeks blooodcalrtttt serious teckers on that stage
Dave no words just young man I am so proud of you and all the guys who made this performance one of the best I've ever seen 👏
So my man Dave got a star studded stage,started of playing the guitar switched to piano then rapping then back to guitar . Dave is goated🐐
No words …. 🙏🏾 🔥
That was sensational. The guitar, piano and electric guitar segments were insane. Choir did their thing too.. actually 10/10
Fucking amazing.
DAMN !!! That's Heavy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Santan Dave, a man of many talents.
Giggs part fire
Was an epic display 👏🏽
GHETTS ......HIS CLARITY INSANE SO GOOD LIVE
THIS IS ELITE
This was phenomenal 🥺
Can we just stop to appreciate how amazing the opening singer was 🤯🔥
It’s cool to have this posey cut done on stage lyrically talented all the lads, my biggest issue was that everything felt flat. No emotion or energy throughout the performance
This is soo beautiful to watch 🥰🥰🥰😍
I am so glad to be alive right now to know my 16 year old son who loves these talented artist can see . You do not shine in the sunlight by yourself you bring your people through.  ❤❤❤❤❤
Dave is a game changer
biggest track from the uk last year! no doubt!!
Giggs is awesome

https://youtu.be/DSGWYAO-yOw
This is why dave is the BEST artist in the Uk, nobody can touch him like, he’s literally in a class of his own
This is so good.
Fredo went in
I generally don't listen to British hiphop but with bars like,  I stood in front of 3 Dragrons and heard 'Dracarys'.   I'll say I should listen more.
1.36.. what's up with Fredo 🙄🤔
Check me out uk rapper
Ghetts 🔥🇰🇪
🔥🔥🔥
My black kings 💕
This was so heavy wow. Every verse got smashed. And is Dave playing a guitar that's shooting flames not the coolest thing ever done on stage? Amazing.  Only thing missing for Me was Kano and/or D double they needed the whole gang
Goosebumps - GOAT 🔥
Hello hello lm : ;nbj
I thought I was chaps, turns out it was goosebumps 🥶🥶🥶
I really dislike the choir can’t even hear them rapping over them and fredo saying the n word on the Brit’s Urm no sir…. But Dave, ghetts and Giggs never disappoint 👏🏽
ghetts!!
Imagine Kano on this tho 🔥
Dave is undeniably one of the best to bless uk Rap, Meekz' passion on the mic m ghetts' wordplay though 🤢🤢🤢
Ok ok, wow.
Just needed stormzy in this performance
Woke BS 🤣
Great performance from Dave but Ghetts🥶🥶🥶
Ghetts
GOAT.
Whole set absolutely lit 💥
“Do your research…”
🔥
Ye its kinda different when the fires what you start from
Damn shout out Meekz. Went from that dirty backyard accidentally doing a face reveal, to here ✊🏾
Meeks common
Dave for the Grammy👑👑👑
Up there with Nick Jonas for playing the electric guitar.
The guitarrrrrr 😍
Ahhhhh this is fire 🔥
Meeks and Fredo shoulda had longer  features
Who's the women at the start ?
Excellence,enough said
Santan Is A Real One🔥🔥💯I Look up To Him🥺♥️
Just needs P money
The crowd wasn't dead; they just wanted to shut up and take in these legends. Once in a life time experience, I'll shut up too.
<3! God Bless this performance from all artists involved
Queen better give Santan his MBE soon
Stopped me dead in my tracks this .. Absolutely love the scene and what these fellas doing 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
The reaction when Giggs came!
That was absolutely EPIC. No other words.
UK avengers,  always seen them as stars but this performance really solidifies that on a professional level, big big moment for uk
Now this is music 👏❤️
I have alot of respect for Dave like he doesn't rap about girls and jewelry he's rapping about his own life he's like the British Eminem
I was here. Dave killed it🤩
From Jekyll and Hyde to this. Dave 🙌
dave you are smashing it 100 legacy will live on ya only young
Can I like this twice
hopefully there wardrobe for the night was picked by someone else, otherwise there “mates” are fake and shade… lookin like absolute pillocks the lot of u. well done for the catchy beat but tis a  shame u all look like dale winton trying to be cool
Not to be sentimental though but Santan is an embodiment of talent
I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. That for me was the greatest live song performance I have ever seen from any rapper 👑 not even Travis Scott could compete with all the fire that was on display 🔥
CHILLS 🧊 WHEN HEARING ABOUT THE TRIALS IN THE FIRE 🔥. GOOSEBUMPS
Ghetts godly flowwww
🤟🏽🔥
The rapping, piano
Santan, this is the greatest video i've ever watched in my 20 years. I cannot wait until you come to toronto in may. 🐐
Santan Dave Fucking goat 🐐
Seeing Dave grow as an artist from a 16 year old spitting on blackbox to him shutting down the BRITS with 4 of the biggest rappers in the game while playing 2 different instruments is something else 🔥 🔥
shite
THE best performance the Brits has ever seen.
Dave’s a beast!!! ♥️
Dmn Meekz sounds clean on stage ! props to the sound team on this one.
🔥🔥🔥On Another Level 🔥🔥🔥
This is ELITE!
Ghetts is the GOAT all day but man like Meekz shelled this performance.
What an epic performance! Just pure talent on that stage, everyone delivered fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing performance! 🙏❤️
Nice 👈 ☺️👍 💙
they call him Giggs, cuz he needs a job outside of rap to pay the bills.
CERTIFIEDDDDD HOOODDD CLASSSICCCCC
greatness
i’m VOICELESS, dave is amazingly talented and inspired !  they all did it all right
I literally cried watching 🥺😭❤️
They killed this. Not one bar missed
Meekz manny killed that verse 💯💀🧊
Dave is in his own fucking lane 😪🔛🔝
Nothing more telling about Dave than the fact he uses his moment in the limelight to promote his friends too. Best album of the year by a country mile
MEEKZ 🔥🔥🔥 TOO SICK
All i got to say is this need to be on a  move #santandavemovies
Anyone know what jacket Meekz is wearing
He murdered that guitar though
He's beyond human. There are literally no words to do this justice. He makes me thankful I'm alive at the same time he is. We need to treasure and protect him.
Meekz is DIFFERENT
Yes ghetts your time to shine you worked hard bro chain hanging like a G dunno
Greatness 👏🏻
Dave>>>
absolutely iconic
Mk fray mumzz
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bring back 90's rap please this is trash.
That Jan polish bar was maaaaad 🔥 🔥 🔥
My favorite video of all time
*This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen to it, I never get bored.*
That girls voice is hella deep
You win bredda 🏆
you don’t need to get the whole crowd singing your lyrics. you need to get them inspired. and dave does that every single time.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favourite UK artist ever. To all English folks, please cherish that man. Most don't even remember that this kid's still 23 years old! A true legend in my book, being from a dumb generation, yet managing to be so unique, woke and real. I appreciate every lesson I take from music, and every feeling it gives me, but gotta admit it gives an extra joy to see guys my age thinking and acting the way he does. Clearly visible that he's highly intelligent, and most of all, learned the most from his experiences. He is, to me, what most guys our generation should be like.
Coz of Dave, I can now proudly say I’m a Black Rockstar
Wow.
Ghetts with him jackets 🔥🔥
Didn’t it used to be called smash hits party
Dave bringing everyone in big legend in the scene gonna have his own record label one day 💯💯💯
Dave has changed the Brits forever
simply Epic.
These lot are some of the best in the UK scene not to mention Dave being the best in the UK industry and I think it would be cool to see him work with some great US rappers,I'm so proud of this guy,this performance was amazing by a guy who can do anything a true musician
Yo who is that woman singing at the beginning? Amazing!! 🔥
Man like Santan
Phenomenal. This is what we need at our next launch!
Dave is one of the best artists right now and that’s pretty hard to deny, at only 23 aswell! He’s got all the time to cement his place as a goat in the UK scene!
Shout out Santan Dave everytime that’s my guy cmon ❤️👊🏾💯💯
❤️
{Me and santan you won't see nothing like dis again}.    Much respect man 🖤

Fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Dave's definitely going down in musical history. Absolute legend.
tremendous performance 🏆
It’s crazy listening to Giggs and ghetts in school on my phone, super underground and now on the brits!
I feel like Dave and Kanye have the same Vibe
A guitar solo in a rap song and it fucking banged…    No cap, Dave ain’t the best rapper to me (he’s one of the best though) but he is the most talented to come in the music scene!!!
Yes Dave on the electric guitar 🔥🔥🔥
What a talented guy Dave is
I don't know why, I was disappointed in this performance. I can't put my finger on it 😫  I think his last brits performance was better
goosebumps, Legendary
what does the letters at the back of the stage say?
Meeeeeeekz
Daveeeeeeeeeeeeeee. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Sorry Dave fans, he's miming his electric guitar solo
Rr
F**king SANTAN DAVE 🎯!!!!
People, Dave is an incredible artist, songwriter and public figure. But don’t lie and say this that he was any good on guitar. He fucked up many of times and it wasn’t all that technical at all. Praise people for the good they do, don’t make up shit yeah?
Unreal, avengers assemble!
Crap
Honestly, so moved me....amazing...I can't say any more 💯🔥
💕
Thats what i call a performance
Next level!!! Enough said say no more!!!
I think santan is a god
Mobos not brits
Have you been tried in the fire?  🔥
https://youtu.be/MmxQR1qr6r4
love this performance with my entire being
Santan and the gang advisor 🔥🔥
Only disappointing thing about this video is that ghetts didn’t get a bigger cheer for the crowd
Legend
Powerful isn’t a strong enough word
very gud ukay drilla song
Woke PC rubbish! Need to go back to the 90’s when we had proper British bands making proper music and performing on the brits!
Don't play with fire 🔥
The best song in the whole album ‼️
Absolute shit , what’s actually happened to music these days ?
This is fire 🔥 pardon the pun! #TrustsNo1
Dave invoked the spirit of his kinsman Sir Victor Uwaifo with those flames #IfYouKnowYouKnow #EdoToTheWorld #BlackBritishExcellence🖤💪🏾🇬🇧
INCREDIBLE
🔥
EPIC!!! Artistry
Love seeing man dem on the brit stage, come some far
I don’t think I will get over the performance, Dave is a legend. 😭😭😭😭 I’m literally crying wtf did I just watch, definitely beautiful

Don’t care what anyone says Dave is a legend 🥶🥶

daveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee............................ you heat that shit nigah
Dave is the 🐐 was fire that 🔥 can’t wait to watch him live next week 🔥🔥
Most of Dave fans don’t have a clue about playing piano and guitar hence the excessive hype. Good show tho 🙏
Meekz absolutely smashes it yet again. Never fails.
this is historic wtf!
Meekz, Ghetts, Giggs. That’s the three giants right now.
Im so bloody proud to be black and see black artists thriving just beautiful

Yessssss boys, fucking smashed it!!
Performance was incredible but I've never seen the big bad Hallow Man Giggs so anxious lol
Like I can’t explain how much I love Dave and I am not a rap head. He tells our story with eloquence and poise. His musical ability transcends genres, ages, culture and races. His album made my 70 year old Nigérian mother cry. He told her story!
Ghetts wordplay unteal underrated bro
Emotional performance

Brings back memories of Eros , Enfield .... Blessed 🙏
That’s talent
Goosebumps

The woman's voice at the beginning had my spine straight tingling! So powerful!
This is the reason why Dave is my favourite artist
That was FIRE.
Dave... Hmmm !
Giggs looked nervous like someone from rap show UK. Why didn't ghetts get a massive cheer when he came out??
This is this generation's Game Over. Absolute levels.

Fredo looking at Dave like "what a guy"😂🔥
Dave is an absolute genius. He has worked on his craft and stayed true to his roots. An extraordinary individual that really does bring entertainment value. Ghetts verse is so underrated on this, it’s woven and worded beautifully.
Бля, я обрадовалась, думала dave это девушка в начале, а это очередной репер
Proof that more guitars are required  in today's music to really shiver
GOOSEBUMPS
This performance is so fire 🔥
Articulated legend! This is what is good about dave, he is a verbal genius and he gives me hope for the future of all music!
🐐🔥
Big up Dave

Nobody talking about how meekz so confidently snapped
Good shit, I knew I started listening to UK Hip Hop for a reason
What can't Dave do? Man can do everything, I swear 💯
Watching this is soo addictive... who's with me ???
Dave and ghetts are two of the best artists in the world no doubt
you did good dave 💥💥 i rate u bring the mandem on it that was cold
Bro on his fela shi 🅿️
LOVELY
🔥🔥🔥
Santan Dave. What a legend. Not much more needs to be said.
Greetings  I felt this song   FIRE FIRE FIRE Everything on POINT.
This is honestly incredible. Dave and Ghettes were on another level
I don’t think i’ve ever seen an artist as talented as Dave, lyrics incredible but also the way he picked up the acoustic and electric guitar (which he only started learning 4 months ago) and Piano as usual and made an incredible performance. Can’t wait to see him live this summer
Nah man just came and completley took over the game. There’s never gunna be anyone greater than Dave 🔥💯
Amazing
Come through with the guitar Dave🔥🔥
Amazing performance. Class from Dave choosing this song to showcase some of his mates, love the fire theme + the raw talent of Dave is great, never knew he played the guitar too, this guy does everything 🔥🔥🔥
Dave is GOATED OMD
That performance was absolutely fantastic. ‘Gary Barlow’
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
GOAT
❤
Dave is the modern day mozart
brabo
THIS IS LEGENDARY🔥🔥
Young legend
WHAT A PERFORMANCE
This song is so cold I want to frame it
Dave is such a talent, master in the rap game, producing, music instruments. Mehn reeeaaal 🔥
This song is touching. Especially coming from a struggle ✊🏾. This is Exuberant Black Excellence
I love how most artist it’s all about them but Dave no… it’s about everyone for everyone. Big love ♥️ absolutely smashed it
off to see if the reactors are reacting..
Actual legend
Wish I was there to experience this in person cause it just looks too unreal! Dave really out did himself on this and IN THE FIRE was a top tier choice 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
who is that woman at the beginning because she sounded STUNNIN
Just wow!!
🐐
Man this performance was on FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Giggs just admiring Dave on the guitar, you can see how much he rants him💯the future is in great hands!!
History in the making ❤ who was the lady vocalist amazing tone
Can’t beat ghetts
Out of all the rappers and minus dave what a moment this would have been to Meekz Manny #cantstopwontstop
This is what you call an artist!!! 🔥❤️
Goosebumps
Didn’t think I could love this song anymore, goosebumps!
Emily carter says this is "better" than rammstein ? Lol i fell off my bed laughing at this school play
🐐🐐🐐🐐
This is fucking iconic  I got goosebumps watching this
I peeped that "Błaszczykowski, I'm trying to score with a Polish" line @Santan Dave, big respect from Poland ;)
Dave is just the best
Fredo chats shit who the fuck listens to him and thinks he’s serious
I cannot even comprehend how much I love this. Dave is on a whole level of his own. I’m speechless
Verses so good you can’t say 1 passed another
Dave is the best musician in the UK.
That was deadly 💯🔥
This moment is so powerful🙌🙏
this guy just keeps raising the fucking bar🔥
Absolute MASTERPIECE ❗️❗️❗️
C r i n g e

Does anyone know the vocalists name!!!  She's incredible
Giggs didnt curse once badman
This was so so good, mahn 🔥🔥 Also, how many instruments can Dave play?? Mad talent
I'm sorry, but that guitar solo is absolutely horrific.
Ghetts got nowhere near the ovation he deserved
absolutely amazing. santan dave the truest. truly magnificent
That guitar playing is comedy gold, you can't fake this stuff.
I was watching this video with a smile the whole time. this gig was so sick 10/10
this is f**king legendary
Ladies and gentleman that’s what you call art at the highest level
Been here since JKYL+HYD, Dave is like a big bro, so proud one of the GOATS!!
Dave brought a better solo than Liam Gallagher and Sam Fender 🔥
Dave is just too, too, too sick.
no beef all love man love to see it
*I Can’t Lie* I was bored by most performances at The Brits.. went to reach for my coffee but Dave woke me up.
You can just see what it means to meeks for putting him on like that. Dave 💯
I really hope this goes on spotify as a live recording 🤞
Oh this is sick.
Fucking awesome!!!!
Daves been a level ahead since he was 16. One of the best to do it currently, not just UK bit worldwide.
🔥🔥🔥
Full love from Ghana afrifa Love you Santan
You’re too cold Daveman
still wondering why Giggs was featured, he's juss below par, respectfully!!!
Man this is now my favorite performance ever 😭 up there with kendrick lamar’s 2016 grammys performance 🔥
Dave said "Avengers Assemble"
goat of 🇬🇧 rap scene

Dave does not get enough credit in the rap game he needs to be more respected internationally
Whose the opening vocalist???
AHHHH
Where did Fred get that hoodie from?
BIGMANSANTAN!
The vocalist at the start has a powerful beautiful voice. Her voice tells a story.
Man really dropped a verse and guitar solo back to back 🙏🏽🔥 this is why we love Dave!
Just got my ticket to the Houston show and I can't wait!
Mad performance. What a dead crowd for ghetts though🤦🏽‍♂️
Fredo rolled out of bed 30 minutes before the brits started
Beautiful
Where is the diversity that they all moan about? No Asian or white people
Speechless ✊️
Going to say Probably one of the best brits proformances. But changed to. Was the best.
Art 🔥
Before my entrance I took the fire exit
Just imagine In The Fire giving me the chills!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Still can’t believe giggs verse is on this masterpiece. smfh.

You know Giggs has been around the block the way he censors his own live performances
Mana santan the gang adviser🤫🤫🤫
Guy 1: You saw that Dave Brit Awards performance? G2: Not yet...was it good? G1: You would never believe a Rap performance would end with a "fire" guitar solo! G2: That's different...it was that good? G1: No bro...I mean yes, but fire guitar solo! G2: Okay it was a good guitar solo...calm down G1: You're not hearing what I'm saying. Just watch it for yourself 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Man the last rapper I saw play the guitar like that was Wyclef
Dave, talented, gifted, phenomenal.

Before I had money it was time I invested, what a fucking line !

For me Dave is the one of the best artists/rapper/storytellers, personally I think he's the closest rapper to Kendrick Lamar...in terms of thought provoking, consciousness and album quality. #MoreBlessingsDave🔥🙌🏾

I want dave to be my friend
That solo was fucking insane
I would’ve loved to have seen Kano up there too.
I'm not gonna lie I think this might be one of the best UK performances  I've ever seen on the Brit Awards uno🔥 This is just incredible from the Choir to the raps and the ability to just make this masterpiece so soulful with these individuals keeping it real & authentic. Kudos this is just great. Big Up 🇬🇧
Everyone but Fredo and meekz muted cuss words 😂
Dave is another level in this business. Much respect 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Man is talented, it's too much
God bless the man dem unity is strength m¥ people, look at the kings dem display!
Seeing dave 26th of this month in Leeds... Going to be🔥🔥🔥
Did they forget to blur out fredo saying the n word😂
Dave is best U.K. rapper right now.
Santan makes music a blessing   ❤️. All the way from Zambia🇿🇲.
W
Oh my another classic Dave award ceremony moment. Ghetts, Fredo, Meeks, Giggs what more can I say. I’m not worthy.
fuck sake giggs sounded absolutely dreadful, never rated him live giggs, makes you think  well it does me, about how easy it would be to make it IF you had a sick team around you (studio engineers, masters, mixers, etc etc) these guys really are lucky. They made it, and MOST not all, just fuck girls every day and drink loads and do drugs, drive a few sports cars around here n there and perform at music events. The entirety of there purpose is flawed and disgraceful. GOD will see them all one day!!!
Dave is one of his kind, can't no one do it better. Dude a true legend
The man dem CAME THROUGH
How can you watch this and tell me he's not the UK goat - rapping, piano and a guitar solo after only 4 months of learning mad 🔥
the love giggs got❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
What a load of absolute drivel. Really, honestly this is the best of British? For a gender neutral Brit awards there sure was a lot of bollocks.
so much talent put into one song😭
Woi
literally fire
Really gave me goosebumps 🔥
Literally my favourite song from the album, so happy they performed it
Dave Santana now?
Insaneee
I just love Fredo
Couldn’t of been done better respect to all the boys
Holy fuck
Ghetts bars man 🔥
Her voice is amazin
Damn
Dave Is so talented and a great musician and rapper
legendary
so fucking hard bro
Man like Dave with the gituar 🎸 What a performance from everybody on Brit Awards 👊🏾🎥
What an inspiration.
Salute
So talented just keeps bringing out new skills
Unbelievable ✌️👍💪✌️
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Dave is literally one of the best rappers in the UK rn❤❤
Why’s nobody talking about sis with the vocals🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🤞✊🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why man wins Brits
This is 🔥
Fredo like a skinny big narstie
Wow💯
Goated with this one
Seeing the whole scene here it’s great to see where we’ve come now, also I wish there was more praise for ghetts
I am so thankful that I found out who Dave was musically. I was drawn to him from his performance as Moldie on Top Boy (which he killed that performance as well). But as an artist muscially he reminds me of a Kendrick Lamar, Andre3000, Lauryn Hill, Solange...etc. Hell even Prince. To our beautiful Black British Brothers and Sisters. Know this. We love you. We support you. Never let people think that there is a division between you all and us (African Americans). This performance is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It has grime, hip hop, gospel, jazz, and soul!!  I am going to see Dave out here in San Francisco on 4/26. Keep killing the music game. One love!
This is beyond iconic I'm ngl.
their deliveries were so fucking special, fredo sounded so raw performing and Ghetts verse was suttin else truly. Daves last verse is perfect to end out the song, and ofc he had to add a guitar solo at the end. whoever has not seen this or heard this song truly is missing out man im telling you
Why this song slap so much harder live?
This should be a national anthem 🥺🥺😫
Legendary 🔥
Santan a Genius man!!!
Wow
That ghetts verse ❤️‍🔥
Damn, what a cool, smart Person. Don't know about this side !!! Maybe one of the best live performance, i´ve ever seen 🔥
🐐
A true masterpiece of a song what a performance 👏 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nah to see ghetts and giggs performing in 2022 on the big stage again icl it actually gave me goosebumps
Wow.
🔥 Amazing and beautiful performance and definitely my favorite track from the album Love from USA
Omg this is sooooo crazy 😍🔥🔥
What a performance I hope it gets a lot of recognition at least 2 mill views 300k views in less than a day is a good start such a cold song 🔥
All that was missing was devlin
Epic 😈👌🏻
Can't wait to see him in two week 💯
Favourite song on the album so glad they finally perfomed it!!! Dave Santana is the leader of the new school!! B1
Dave is blessed
What's this all these black men on British TV? Fuckin ell, you'd think we're in Africa
I didn’t know Lil Wayne performed at the Brits this year ?
The actual GOAT
Fucking beautiful
A performance that will go down in British history... What a talent! 🔥
Terrible guitar solo. Sounds like a beginner in a Guitar Center. But because he is a rapper, and black, they will act like he is brilliant at it.
Seeing Dave grow as an artist from a 16 year old spitting on blackbox to him shutting down the BRITS with 4 of the biggest rappers in the game while playing 2 different instruments is something else 🔥 🔥
Meeks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That shit gave me goosebumps
swear thats mkay frays mum
Mandem on fire 🔥🔥🔥 legendary performance
I had goosebumps watching this!
Literally the greatest hip-hop performance in years!
Well... it gave lil Wayne's solo a run for its money... what was that?
There's a difference between being a rapper and being an artist. Dave is the latter, his versatility and musicality is unrivalled
Canadian here. Didn’t think i would see anything top Stormzy’s 2018 Brit Awards performance. But, here we are. Dave is that guy.
So what were not going to talk about ghetts or giggs?
This would not have been possible without Channel U, if you know you know.
Legendary
GHETTS 🙏🌊
Dave is 🔥
Have u ever seen Fred bud without a trim
Too fuckin cold
To see him go from black box to a performance like this. The work rate is inspirational🔥
_these lads are on fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire_
🐐
Watched this yesterday it felt spiritual.
Dave is the GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐
Shame kano wasnt involed in this tune
If Santana was a rapper that loves Rammstein pyrotechnics. I'm discovering this artist. Fire performance. That guitar solo and the flamethrower guitar were more rock'n roll than what passes as rock nowadays.
Gooaaat🐐
💣💥🔥🔥🔥
This link up made me think about a lot of things. The newers having mutual respecting their olders, multitalented artists, a mesh of so many genres being recognised as uk music, made me tear up I swear
One of the best songs of 2021 fuck drill!! Keep this alive Dave
How has he turned the Brits into his own study session😂
This is one of the greatest brits performances ever .
Jeez Dave save some talent for the rest of us😂 what a performance from everyone though🔥
I didnt think his performance last year could be topped...damn
Dave is the English Tupac as in artist wise
No one better🐐
This was a fcuking moment. So happy I was here and blessed to see it. Yes king.
This performance was insane.
fredo!!❤
different gravy. absolutely unreal 🔥
This is an iconic performance. great way to end the night 🤛🏼🔛🔝
I live in the Bahamas and I’ve been on Dave’s talent since Samantha
Dave samshed it as always ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What a performance and what an utterly dead crowd, they didn’t deserve what was in front of them
My GOAT My GOAT My GOAT 🌟🙏
Un fucking real
Giggs is actual shite how anyone can like him i do not know
🔥🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌
The guitar bit is cold until you just see its all the other bloke lol... 7:35
Amazin
Hope.
This is one legendary performance frfr
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
somthin special
That's was incredible 👏
why we still don’t have a music video to this song continues to baffle me
I needed this, so so good.
No offence to you. This was an incredible performance but if u had 7 minutes i genuinely feel like you should have done heart attack. It was a song that i just shook off at first but later really came to appreciate. But of course i get the fact that this is the brits and therefore a whole group of british artists performing together was fitting. An extra verse would have been dope too.
That guitar solo is what sets dave out from all the rest in my opinion he don't conform to the usually rapper personality man's up there channeling straight jimmy hendrix vibes fucking love it!!!😂
Nice
yeah man
The strenght in this one tho. My babes dem #ghetts #G and #D 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤🥰
The opening vocalist, not over that yet That was one of the richest baritones I’ve ever heard Wasn’t ready for Ghetts 🤯 The CHOIR 😭 its tew much Giggs looks good all suited up. Love that verse Yo Dave the guitar solo 🎸😭 Amazing performance, happy ears right here 👏🏾🔥✨
I can't stang that Giggs' verse... I don't like him anyway though
Damn...  Just damn... 🔥
Big up Dave coldest out there ❄️
Third guy sounds SO much like kano its mad
Definition of a goat
This is the greatest live performance I’ve ever seen ! Stars aligned 🔥
Amazing
One of the best live performances I've seen 👏 real talk
Truly unreal performance.
YESSSIRRR
Fucking legendary
Everyone dressed somewhat proper and censors their lyrics. Fredo was cussing with a green hoodie and jeans on😂 Man just doesnt care he  stays himself, I rate it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯🔥
seeing meekz on this got me gassed
Black excellence at its finest❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a talented individual.
Dave can do everything,special
The song is over and I still got goosebumps
Fantastic performance by all the rappers, Dave is on another level. Can we talk about that amazing choir please, voices of Angels! I'm a massive Sam Fender fan loved his performance but this was outstanding. Well done guys 👏👏
Best performance I’ve ever seen , every transition from every each rapper was smooth  and Dave’s amazing guitar solo at the end of the performance.Amazing .The song is amazing already I been blaring n all
Straight cringe with that stupid choir
Wow
Has a heart of gold this guy. Very very dedicated and very very talented, lyrical genius and a true definition of a musician. His Live performances are 10/10 every time… best in the industry
Fredo looked so awkward LOOOOL
Goosebumps
its Dave playing the guitar for me what a talented guy
Incredible!
the first one , is that a man or a woman?
Musical genius
Dope tune ayy ✌️ it was suggested to me from “Dupe - International “
This performance is going down in history
🐐🐐
Wow, proud to be British, real talent
EXCELLENCE
💎🤘🔥
WOW!!
Beyond an amazing performance 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾! Don’t think he was playing that guitar at the end though! Alright Modie!
I'm not even a big meekz fan but holy shit he bodied that performance, it sounds like the original track, nerves of steel! My top song of 2021, they came in like the UK Avengers, so glad they performed this, well done David!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
In a world full of negatitivity I’m grateful to be here if i get to notice shi like this💞🌍

Dave is so fucking talented, playing 3 instruments   Ghetts killed his verse aswell
Jeeez Meeks and ghetto killed dis
That guitar solo was shite
Dave the best out of uk
Dave is a GOAT!!!
Sickmade 🔥
Dave got robbed on Album of the Year...
This is a moment for artists! Dave is a legend🖤🔥
Can't lie the guitar playing wasn't that impressive and I never really loved this tune seemed like an average performance to me
Wow
Team Ghetts and dave
This shit got me shaking 😳
Might be one of the best performances I’ve ever seen
She hears like a man
Lil Wayne was his guitar teacher
Giggs was a little lazy on that one but this was still awesome
There’s level to this shit
Best guitar solo since Brian May at Live Aid
Meekz is the coldest !!!!!!!! He wasn’t even trying, the voice sounds like it’s came off a song he’s that good live, with a mask on!!! Silly
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Madddd tinggggg🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
love you, can’t wait to see you❤️‍🔥
This performance was just 🔥🔥🔥🔥
that was fuckin sick
More life, more history.

Arrepiei demais, pqp!  🔥 🔥
"Crimes on the rise, hates on the rise Feel like everythin’ but my mum’s pay’s on the rise"  i hope the MP's were watching   🔥
What a goat 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
not usually my cuppa tea that... but when I seen this last night got goosebumps, was pretty special
I know the word died back in 2015 but that was fucken epic
0:54 I felt that frustration 😂 Insane performance by all though, I'm ready for the shows!
Sick dave just rocking it out at the end. Legend. History made. Awesome performance ❤️💙❤️
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Amazing

Goosebumps I SWEAR TO GOD 🎵💫 GOD BLESSED EVERYONE ON THAT STAGE ❤️
Everything about this is incredible! What a performance, what an act and what an artist all of those guys are. Dave is that guy.

Dave will continue to change the game for as long as he makes music. Generational.
Crazy hard
Damn her voice is deep. Amazing!
Meekz killed this!!!!
Lil Wayne got a problem 🎸🔥

😭
The only 3 words I have after watching this are...  FUCKING.EXCEPTIONAL. ARTISTRY !  Dave is really a rare thing in his line of work. Not everyone can rap, play the piano, and kill a guitar all in the span of about 10 minutes. Thank you Dave for appreciating the art and doing it the way it’s meant to be done. With passion and lots of it. That’s what makes you stand out from the rest.
Man plays an electric guitar now!💯
ppl gonna be talking about this for years on years dave forever proving himself as a legend in this game
Guitar, Piano, electric guitar AND smashes his verse.  An all-timer performance, Dave is the 🐐
This is too slick. This is how the Brits should be. They should always allow Dem man to showcase talent
History in the making
What a  🔥 MASTERPIECE 🔥
Don't see the hype
Love it, so talented.
Bless Dave 😇
🔥🔥🔥
daves come a long way from doin pics wit fans after shows an havin almost every person in the crowd run past him to go to aj. both artists have evolved since thiago silva no cap

Is there nothing this man can't do?
this was an amazing performance. the set looked incredible, the choir was electric!! and every other artist delivered. quite literally fire. i will never get tired of watching
Meeks,Fredo,Ghetts,Giggs,Dave. (The face of the Streets)🗣🎤🗣🎤🗣🎤🗣🎤🗣🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dave is definitely a man of many talents (it just goes to show that just because you look a certain way doesn’t mean you act that way)
JEEHEEZ !

Incredible
Surely no one above the age of 15 actually enjoyed this
yeah this shits something else man. sickkkkk
Whos the don in the mask?

Once in a while a performance comes along and blows you away...this wAS ONE OF THEM!

Thank you Dave . You are a legend . Changed my perception about music . God bless !
This put a smile on my face. Great performance
Giggs is honestly so shite

You won’t be saved by the bell when you hear it screech
Black excellence!!!!

Honestly thought he was gonna perform heart attack, but this is better
This purely elevates the song. Dave is next level. Ghetts had amazing stage performance and meekz as well.
this is bad comb ever 🥇
Dave 🐐😭
"In The Fire" is an incredible song as it is but this performance took it to new height. Outstanding from all the artists and choir.
😳😳😳💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💢
In my opinion this is the best brit performance potentially ever
Meekz could've had better bars. I think he didn't realise the magnitude
This is beautiful pure goosebumps
From the Solo singer to the Dave.. smashed it 🔥
Dave is The coldest I swear down
David hendrix ya knowww wtf
😍😍😍
Brilliant. 67 year old lover of talent!!

We in Russia really love you Santan! You GOAT
All I'm gonna say is wow! Dave is an absolute national treasure!
Love the way they stylised this as a fireside chat, we’re the boys are just sharing struggles
giggs smashed it
i love this guy so much man
Dave by far the greatest artist on earth, this guy is so versatile its literally insane
Fuckin hell what a performance. Ghetts didn’t get the recognition he deserves from that crowd
mid
Crazy! 🔥
not a single white person on stage at a BRIT award ; imaginje if it was the other way around
🐐
unbelievable
Incredible performance! Dave has so much passion I love it ❤ he's a fresh of fresh air in the UK honestly
PERFORMANCE OF THE MFING NIGHT!!!!!
Surreal
I took a punt and went to see this guy at Glastonbury.  What a great performance he put on.     That's the brilliance of Glastonbury, instead of being disappointed about who isn't playing, get excited for someone you don't know who is playing!
Sheeesh 🔥
why are you this good
MAAAADDDDD talent is insane. playing guitar, piano, singing, rapping, producing he does it all. Lyrically great, wordplay the best. Looking forward to the 21.02!
This was gd idk why the live broadcast was not as gd I knew it was something wrong because I know that Dave fredo meekz ghetts and gigs are fire and on telly it might just be my tv gigs was almost inaudible but big up to Dave
absolutely unbelievable performance.
wow loving how  blues and electric guitrar are getting integrated in the uk rap scene
Santans gonna be the British Kanye west I swear
‘Slappa the base’ Dave ⭐️
Wow🔥
Bro Dave is really that dude, don't be surprised if this man ends up in the goat conversation. There's nothing dude touches that isn't fire. His penmanship and intelligence are unmatched. Everyone of his songs are probably someone's favorite song.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real tears
this right here is what I call Great British Culture
Outstanding performances all round
To be honest , I really love Santan Dave. I am his big fan.
Wow💣💣💣💣💣💣
Dave secretly a Rammstein fan? Incredible performance!!!
Let’s take a minute to appreciate Dave mans rapping is on point mans piano skills are on point and not only can he play the acoustic guitar but he can absolutely rock out with a electric guitar mans got real talent
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
dave born for this 🙌🔥
So proud of you Dave
Wooooow 👏🏾👏🏾
GOATS.
Giggs is so dead lol
This guys a megastar. No other word for it. Highly rated, but still super underated.
Giggs🙏
What the man in the beginning is a woman???
This whole video gave me shivers
I'm 34 now and old enough to remember the humble beginnings of uk grime/rap. This makes me proud seeing how far its came, witnessing performances like this 🔥 💯 big up all the U.K Fam 🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧
It was a good day when the big man made Dave.  He went to town with the talent.
Beautiful not much else to say
Maddd🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! Do you know what this will do for our scene? Big up Dave man, what an amazing human.
Not many people in the world could play an 8 minute song live and play the acoustic and electric guitars and the piano all flawlessly, insanely talented
such a lit performance fam 🔥🔥🔥
Everything about this performance was just spectacular! From the choir’s vocals, to the guitar and piano Dave soloed and don’t get me started on Ghetts’ lyrics... All just fire indeed!🔥
this is madddd
Woke central....
really loved meekz verse. all of them did a great job, incredibe performance- stand out of the evening.
Black and British excellence🙌🙌
Giggs will always go at his own pace. Can't rush class
Dave playing guitar, next thing he’ll be rapping over a dirty rock tune
This right here!!!!!!!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 so proud of Dave
Next Glastonbury headliner
🔥🔥🔥
Whats the name of the girl who started the performance? She is amazing...
i cant believe this performance! i was always thinking how a live performance of in the fire would sound like but this definitely topped my expectations!🔥
I can't wait to see dave in birmingham next thursday. This was incredible.
The opening vocalist is a STAR!!!!!!!
Great artist. Dave is a star.
Dave is literally on a different level to everyone else. His dialogue on the Black experience in the UK, and the way he tells it is unmatched. It's poetry and prose and his voice is so identifiable and clear that you don't feel like you're listening to a rapper, you feel like you're listening to a young Black man pouring his heart and soul out to you. His choice of music to back his vocals is outstanding. I don't love every song he does, but especially between his Brits performance of Black and this, he's standing out.   Personally I think the only rapper close to his level when it comes to this is Stormzy with Rainfall, Crown, Superheroes etc. I'd love to see the two of them collab on a song about the Black experience like this and Black. Would be amazing.
What a legend
I'm glad I'm alive to witness such greatness👏man what blown away🤯🤯
Dave is amazing just needs to leave the road talk for the wolves. He sounds ridiculous talking bad. Dave’s a lamb
Dave is too too talented
damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,wtff man, jeeeeez phantasmagorical.
DAVE DOES IT ALL HES THE GOAT I STG HES A DIFFERNT BREDD
real life guitar hero shit that haha LUV IT
giggs wordplay was mental
This why Dave is the goat coz he says nah if im coming my people are
Geng❤️🔥🔥🔥
Giggs ruined it for ngl
blown away.
Dave is Unreal 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Ghetts is so cold
Iconic 🔥🔥
I’m sorry what?  Dave is LEVELS. Honestly untouchable at this point I feel. What a fucking performance.
untouchable, Dave is the greatest hip hop artist the UK has produced and he always reaches back to uplift his bredren. been a fan of this hip hop thing for over 30 years and this fella still gives me the feels, amazingly dope artist.
GOATED performance!
What a sick performance
Santan make real moves and say and speak only real things,. Inspiration to a generation. ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
WOW.
Just wow! 🔥🔥🔥
He aint playing that guitar
this should of been the official video!!
Dave is so talented
Real artist who sound just as dope live as they do on cd...
Meeeekkkkkzzzzzzz 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ghetts a different breed
Ghetto thinks he's faithless now
Work of art
WayGhetts got the least reception, but had the hardest verse…
Gone Clear.
History.
Legendary
FIRE 🔥 PERFORMANCE 🤝👑
my king👑 !!!
Man santan Dave is the best but still upcoming
Man said Dave doing up rockstar with that guitar at the end makes me want to stick my mouth and say “ROCK ON 👅👅👅🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾”
Legendary Dave!
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
The woman's voice at the beginning had my spine straight tingling! So powerful!
Meekz yano
Legends!!!
Don’t get it twisted, there ain’t ever gonna be an artist like Dave in any genre or country. Even if he don’t reach the heights he deserve, he done things that shoulda been impossible. A road yute banging a guitar solo on stage at the BRIT and got a lad from south crying from the performance. He’s the definition of GOAT for the UK and I don’t think anyone can argue he’s proven that
that was insane 🔥🔥🔥
Madness
I can gladly say I was there ❤️
This was outer space dave playing guitar acoustic and electric man plays piano and can rap his arse off closing out da Brits u know salute my g. This collabo is beast mode 👍🏿🦾🔥😎👑🤯.
The Best.
This is Kanye and Jay style😭🔥🔥🔥
Giggs is overrated, as for the rest..wow
FIRE. EVERYWHERE. 🔥🤘🏼
Giggs is overrated, as for the rest..wow
🔥🔥🔥🌋🌋🌋🌨️❄️🌨️❄️💣💣💣
Beautiful !!!
Great .. but did it beat Stormzys from before? Watch stormzy come back for the crown!!
Holy shit
Meekz voice sound the exact same live, thats so fire , all did good tho!
The goat, robbed of aoty
Thankyou for this :D AMAZING PERFORMANCE I LOVE YOU ALL FR
What a fucking talented human being
A lot of my favourite uk artists all in one track 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
dave is a badman. Guy can rap + play the guitar
Incredible 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Dave smashes it again 🔥
this is how guitar is played, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUHhUy6sBiQ
load of guff, the dude can just about manage to play the guitar without hitting bad notes....
ITS INCREDIBLE SCENES. AMAZING
i looked for the definition of talent in the dictionary = Dave
The fact this sounded just like the album
Not enough people giving Meekz credit for how good he sounds live
Lovely performance and shout out to Giggs
Dave needs to drop the video please.
Yeah this is iconic
When u want kanye performance but from UK
This goes harddddd
These goons are hard af
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely amazing.
Everyone on the track rolled up for it!! Respect
I used to play guitar, my 2019 self would've gone mad over seeing Dave play a Gibson Les Paul 😂   Mental performance tho, Ghetts, Dave and Fredo are on another level
Purest work of art
Dave is just pure talent the only reason I watched for his performance 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💙🐐
Dave is 100% the GOAT of UK rap most man fake their background but Dave is so genuine and is one of the most people i’ve came across. Met him once and was speaking to him and he is so interesting to have a conversation with. My goat 🔥🤝
Black Excellence!
Goosebumps the whole performance. Wish I couldve been there live!!
The man's talented. Dave plays the strings as well 😲
Dave is different
this dave guy is the goat
Just want to say many thanks Dave...
Wow wow wow
i love dave
One of my faves off the no skip album
What a pile of shite
Ghetts is just something else
Ghetts is levels ahead of the Legends in his class
Dave was really playing the guitar in the fire
Different
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 what garbage.
wow
Dave is smart asf, makes a track with legends from the music scene, invites them on the brits to perform with him and as much as they’re his guys he’s just fully shown them what multitalented looks like and made them look beige 😅
Quite possibly the best live rap performance I have ever seen!
This will be one of the best Brits performance ever . Like the way those artist stood and were looking at dave doing these is just everything
That was electrifying!!!!
Multi Talented!
That Baritone Voice shuuuu🥲👏🏿🔥🔥🔥😭😭
Nice to see Meeks getting some recognition 👏
You will not believe how young he is. Dave is definitely something else.
All i can say is m humbled by talent 💯🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥

Didn't think he'd ever be able to top the "BLACK" performance from the other year.... and then dave brings the absoloute 🔥🔥🔥
Who's the lady with the masculine voice

Ghetts is something else

Day 1 of returning to this.
🇿🇲
This is music
🔥🔥👏
goated
Dave just shredding the electric guitar what a talent he is the jack of all trades of music produces, raps , sings , plays countless instruments..  unbelievable 👏
I tried to stay awake for this performance and I fell asleep but let me say this Dave is the greatest musician of our time. Protect this man at all costs. Let him live his life because he is a true creative. We will never see again. He plays the guitar at the start then the piano then the electric guitar then performed his verse. No one comes close to him
You can't do nutn wid Dave... He's waaay over there
Santan is the greatest. He really has got talent this man 🙌. A proud moment for UK music 🇬🇧. A really great moment ❤️
That was fucking amazing go my boys
The fuck is wrong with that crowd? Slept on ghetts, these fucking tiktok kids haven't got a clue
Literally lit🔥
Yooo this made me feel PROUD as hell, and I'm not even from the UK. DAVE is on another LEVEL for real! Bless
Phenomenal!
They brought it! Wow
jewels
This guy santan taught me not to put myself in a box and reach for anything and everything 💯
🔥🔥🔥
You can tell Dave was made for this, he's in his element
the guitar flame thrower was pure Spinal Tap
This was missing potter payper
I mean it's ok, but you younglingz need to chill. Thinking everything is the best but only experienced a couple years of life having no idea wtf is really going on. I like dave he is a human dictionary but give it time, you'll be saying the same shit about another artist in a few years. Rinse and repeat
That was the best bit of the show,I'm an old gran,the rest done nothing for me,but this brilliant
my fav on the tape ✨✨✨✨
BFM on the rise 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ghetts is beyond sensational 🐐🐐🐐
This gave me goosebumps
Fred looks fire
Every time I watch this I get goosebumps
Different Levels 🔥🔥🔥🔥

OH MY DAYS WHAT A PERFORMANCE
Getting the approval and safety checks done for this performance must have been pure hell, llol
🎉🎉💪🏾he is in a different level
I love how Fredo didn't get the memo to censor his verse🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS IS TOOO HARD
The goat 🐐
Wow
Surreal. This guy 🔥
Maaaaaaan! I missed this 🤬
That solo😍
😥😥😥😥😥😥
This is one of the reasons drake co-signed santan, the young man is a genius🙌🏾
Love from Portugal! What a performance 👌🏻🔥🇵🇹
Best artist in the world
Get rid of Giggs and Ghetts and this is one of the hardest performances going🤕
wow
🔥🔥🔥
All tha my favorite i ni
First time I've ever thought it was a dude singing and it wasn't. Great stuff. Just confused me lol.
Manz been learning his Pentatonic. Fairplay
Dave is one of the goats been listening to him since game over and the progression he made is really inspiring 🐐🐐
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
EPIC!!!
Godamn this was amazing, Breath taking performance. Were all alone in this together is a masterpiece, One of the best albums to drop last year, and this song is easily my favourite from the album, this performance just somehow made it better
Oh my gosh, that was totally amazing 😲  Much respect to Dave for making such thoughtful music, that reaches all. Thanks to the #Brits for bringing him back again  and with Fredo,Meeks, Ghetts and Giggs.
Elite
I do not watch the Brits but my sis told me about this performance! Amazing! Multi talented! Keep it going young brother!
Beautiful
Он вообще отлично 🔥🔥🔥
I've been waiting to see this with my eye balls and boy it did not disappoint! Grin so big it's bursting off my face, amazing.
Says he gone be in dallas in May. damn I am in Colorado. But It is not impossible for me to make it to Dallas. SHit come to Denver, I dont know if you smoke, but we on that crud here.
What a load of s#it
Another epic performance! Serious levels to your talent 👌🏾
What an amazing man and incredible performance! Dave is one of a kind
Perfection
What a celebration 🔥
Goosebumps
Dave always coming in with something new in the live performance. Flame throwing electric guitar... great performance
Giggs only rapper I know who can talk on a beat and still be shelling it lol
Meeks was sick man Giggs just absolutely dead 💀☠😂😂😂😂😂
Keep elevating the levels 🙏🏾👏🏽
dave jamming out on the guitar at the end yesssss go on lad 😍 that solo was amazing and i think that proves he's an actual genius bc to learn an instrument to that level as an adult is super hard & takes a lot of intelect, probs way different than the piano too so like seriously the man has a literal genius IQ. i know he's told us as a brag n whatever but i honestly believe him when he says it
This live would of been absolutely insanity, I felt that one ☝️ 🙏✅✅✅✅✅
Vocals at the beginning were so beautiful
Imagine potter payper on this song with them 🔥
Meekz was hard
This is actually too good. Santan is a generational talent.
There's a bigger picture too all this... i love rap grime etc but im clever and this beyond satantic
Crazy performance, blown away
This was nuts!
Can Dave and fredo make a tape man they don’t miss
The GOAT of the UK rap scene, not a question anymore
Legendary 💯💯
Thought that was a man singing at the start wtf
🤩🤩🤩
Just proud to read the comments and how much people see what impact Dave has had on all our lives ❤️
Genuinely can't wait to see him next week 🙌🏾
This stole the show for me stunning piece of art. Bringing rock n roll into rap is a major skill. Brilliant work all of you should be very proud this was just on another level 👏🏻 bravo
Damn her voice is Deep ❗️
Protect this man at all cost
Grime is alive
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Господа, это шедевр

They saved the best till last! Amazing performance my whole family love you Dave. Your the best UK artist we have
Man You've come so far, I remember seeing you in Amsterdam after Psychodrama dropped just a small stage with like about 100 people there. Now here you are putting up huge shows. It's awesome to see how you've grown.

Now that’s what you call a performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥 from beginning to end
Damn boys! That's what I call fucking, vision.💯😎bless up👑🐝
Bro Dave is hands down the best black rapper… dudes on Tupac level 100% well at least better than anyone I’ve heard come out since my lifetime (I’m 22) From Australia 🇦🇺  🇦🇺 🇦🇺
I can't lie, I thought a cheeky extra verse was being added, but Dave came through with the guitar solo? Madness. Dave is an incredibly well rounded artist. His progress has been insane.
What a banger
One word ‘ LEGACY ‘🔥🔥 Like Big Fred said ‘ you won’t see nothing like this again ‘
Legends!

This is the greatest video I have ever seen holy fuck
Классно
I would pay too much money to watch this live

Ghetts and Dave sounding so comfortable live. Incredible energy!
Meekz voice powerfull man
That was f*cking epic.
LETS MF GOO
Giggs getts and Meeks too hard

How many instruments can he play?
The crowd is dead, having a man like giggs on the stage and doesn’t get a massive cheer
legendary scenes
This is 🔥 the transitions is really ace one
THAT.WAS.MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
To think Dave came from doing Street Stars Freestyles and a Bl@ckbox to performing last at Brits with this extreme product is so heartwarming. Truly proud of this man.
🐐
For those who know, how long did dave start playing guitar?
This was the best song of the year isc
live performance makes u appreciate the song so much more 😍
hands down highlight of the night 🐐 🔥
What a performance ! I'm looking forward to a concert in France.
Honestly one of the best performances of the night, absolutely incredible🔥🎸

Okay just clocked Dave didn’t really play the guitar - you can tell if you watch closely.  Sick performance though
One of the best performances
Black British excellence 🔥🔥
This was so cringe😭
Fred and Santan, u won’t see nothin like this again.
NAH THIS IS TOO HARD
Incredible , year on year the genre has come such a long way. From Dizzee to Stormzy and now Dave stealing the show at the brits (all in there own way)... we should be proud as a nation to have such talent on our doorstep 🇬🇧
Dave muhombe🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody can tell me this man isn’t the GOAT
Dave realising Meekz is a g. Dave the best we got
Outstanding 🤩
Genius❤️💯
Goosebumps as I watch
Does this top 'Black' tho?🤔
You won't see nothing like this again 😤

Love the silhouette of Ghetts in the background 0:52
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 best performance ever in Brits history  Just wowwwwwwwwwww  Can’t stop listening to it
Nah Dave is just a 1 of 1 individual. He's so talented and whatever he puts his mind to, he just becomes so good at it. Proud of this man. So inspirational and talented. Shows that you can come from nothing to something.
My 🐐 fr
Chills
Wow
This was next level. All smashed it out the park but Dave is just inspirational
Wow my baby a rockstar 🥺🥺
wheh he retires he going to be the greatest.
I'm so proud of this man. Legendary performance
You can tell Dave put in a lot of thought and hard work into this performance from the piano riffs to the choir singing in the background he’s definitely the 🐐🐐🐐
What makes me cry is everyone came and threw bars he really gave his hommies a platform.
Santan Dave is a Visionary
This performance 😬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 yohhhh!!!!!! 🙆🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thought this was the music video, but I'll take it! This is sick!

Greatest performance of all time
Giggs was admiring the guitar play in the background so much. You can tell he's genuinely got love for Dave's artistry.
WOW
The album of 2021 for sure this is FIRE🔥
As a yank I just love the UK scene! Dave really unites the artists and seeing Meekz on this stage is a pure joy. Take a bow our boys!
🔥🔥🔥 goodness me what a performance
This man brought the whole scene to the nations eyes and played 3 instruments in the meantime, realistically Dave is the best live performer from the UK at this point I’m convinced
These boys are the biggest inspiration to all black boys around the country. Doing more for them than any politician will.
This performance gives me goosebumps. Dave Is the Goat🐐
Dave needs to play the electric guitar mode
Yh cant lie this was dead
the greatest of all time

He is just the future..amazing performance 🎭 Gemini Gang
Phenomenal
Dave is absolutely greatest artist of the century, not even just to say
My king!!!! Im losing my shit 😍😍
The best of U.K ♥️

Daves ability to go from guitar to piano to dropping a verse back to a guitar solo is a thing of beauty. What a talented artist.
Raised goosebumps
❤️
Why did no one cheer when Ghetts came out??? These kids don't know man.
Mad 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How did Adele beat this man makes no sense
Choir sounds good, the lads mumbling a load of shite ruined it😳
When Tupac said be impress when you see a rose 🌹 growing out from a concrete pavement! I guess we now know what he meant when we look at these young talented men! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Only performance I wanted to see and was worth the wait!
Who's that first woman singing, sounding like man ??
Trigger, why do you call me Dave?, my names Rodney...
My tune! 💃🏾 The vocalist at the beginning though 🔥 the tone of her voice 😍
That intro singers voice is magic
best song off the album, deserved a video, this at daves shows will go crazy
Giggs voice thooo😶‍🌫️
I was literally screaming, santan is the 🐐. The last part where he played guitar gave me goosebumps. He is a complete package

Too sick. This is so inspirational man, In so many different ways.  Meekz has navigated his way all the way to being on stage at the brits! With 4 London rappers. How far he’s come in a short space of time is amazing to see.  More life to all of them! Keep uplifting

Every single one did their damn thing on that stage!!! The choir, the opening vocalist, dave on the instruments! Now I shall watch this an unhealthy amount of times!!!

Firstly Impecable, second why is Meeks wearing a bally? did I miss news?
Piano last year, guitar this year. Wouldn’t be surprised if he comes out with a trumpet solo next year🤣 The guys way to talented man
Ghetts performed this with so much power and  meaning I got chills

One of the greatest to ever do it.
This was a top tier performance no one can chat for this guy 🤷🏾‍♂️
Santan Hendrix, enough said. Sheesh!
Wow
Mans can play literally ANYTHING. He's so great and yet still underatted.
FREDO 👑
When Ghetts came on… Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥

For my alboz I highly suggest the tune “Dupe - International “ 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱

I always notice they always pull out certain type of artist and years ago there was supposed to be a more uplift of black representation in the Arts JOKETING! STILL waiting to see that🤔 no black supporting actor no black leading actor no black director no black breakthrough I can go on
Such a dope performance 🔥🔥🇰🇪
Bloody hell bruv This hit home
Dave is so talented. He blew me away once again
Woiiii
Been waiting to see a live performance of this, and I'm not disappointed! Dave is once in a generation artist!
LOVED THAT!!!!
What u telling me dave playing guitar as well? what cant this yute not do bro? Elite

This is a beautiful performance I really love that he chose this song to perform so that the other artists on this masterpiece could perform as well true black excellence.extremely proud of the creativity put into this. Dave is a jack of all trades because that guitar riff was amazing. I love Dave so much man , love from 🇯🇲
what cant this brudda do I swear...
Honestly, i expected nothing less 😍😍😍😍😍
My guys🔥🔥🔥
He’s got that level guitar playing idk why they think it’s a good idea to shit like that when he’s obviously quite a novice he’ll look back and regret that if he sticks at guitar and gets better aha
Ghetts is one of the best to ever live no one can say otherwise
6:37 first thing I thought of was Lil Wayne 😂 sorry Dave
No matter how 'overrated' some may say he is, no denying he is the man 🔥🔥
One of the best live performances I've ever seen! 👏🔥🔥
Legendary 🔥
my man playing all the instruments!!!
This is perfection, people.  Edit: Man gituar solo'd (duet?) at the end? Bruh. Pulled out all the stops.
Dope tune 😈😈 it was suggested to me by Up Next , “Dupe - International “ 🔥🔥🔥
One of the best songs from one of the albums of the year by one of the artists of the year. Dave is different gravy. All people put their ALL into this
Im just wow, speechless  !!! I wish I was there!
This was more than a performance this was a statement ..A proud moment for the Uk rap scene. 💥💥💥
Should have played something a bit more upbeat.
fucking insane. Ghetts and giggs give me shivers but Meekz, Fredo and Dave just are something else. INSANEEEEEEEE!!!!!! <3

Ghetts with the firefighter fit. 🥶
