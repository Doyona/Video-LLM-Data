Come for the golf … stay for the banter 👍
32:58 Well done Matt 👍
Peter, you should get a condo in Jupiter for the winters and rent it in the summers… should pay for itself 🤔❤️⛳️ or a house for you and your crew 🤷🏻‍♀️
Absolutely hilarious lis was Fryer who chose to do stroke play!😂👌 I'm surprised Peter, Andy, & Rick. Don't poke fun at Matthew for saying things twice all the time?! Lol.
That was awesome!!
Bit of hinge and bit of flick, oh and miss the golf ball😂😂😂😂
You should do a variation on this:  Each player choses the clubs the opposing player must play with before the match at an unknown venue chosen by a third party,
Witter on like a couple of old women, and Finches putting is getting worse, needs an eye test or lessons in reading the grass on the green😂😂
Awesome video guys. Love the banter and the golf. BIG FAN
Great seeing 2 mates enjoy playing together, that's what the game is all about --- MORE PLEASE !!!!!
The last roll of the ball. Perfect..🐦
Jesus   these guys talk total bullocks.
I wish this wouldn’t have ended all square. Pity, really.
That was SO good. Thanks!
You two have some of the best banter! Keep it up! Loved the ones you did together recently as well
Just before Peter took his 18th tee shot, he morphed into Rick Sheilds ...don't believe me check it out for yourself😆....great show Mat ,loving the Rick,Andy,Peter and yourself vids as well good banter.
Love the chatter
Always quality between you two! And Andy to be fair. The air swing from the thorn bush, if you didn’t make contact does the swing count? No idea on the rules
"Oooh Ello".
That’s was class, much fun to watch, cheers gents.
21:02 is that rolling by itself in the background?
Always a good match with you two. 😂👍
Classic walk towards hole after final putt,no words needed 😂
Honestly Think You and Carter do the best videos. All-out guys Finch, Shiels, Robinson should do more videos together you get a good laugh when there's competition. Keep the mind games going Matt one day it'll work I'm exactly the same like giving out a bit of banter and making my opponent think a bit 😆
Matt if you had that swingless club you would have got the ball out!
That was one of the funnier and more entertaining full vlogs I’ve watched out of all of you guys. I love the banter back and forth.
That was SOOO funny 😂 you two are great 😊
Holy cow!  What a shot from the heather!  I'm wondering whether a goat was sacrificed off'-camera.
I love the fact you guys show real golf warts and all instead of being perfect all the time! Great partnership
I've come for the banter. And I'm not disappointed!!!
20.57 A golf bag decided to abandoned his human and went for it! Never to be seen again!
Mr Finch needs more matches like this if he ever wants to qualify for the Open. Mental toughness probably only comes from experience.
Heh I was rooting for you on this one Matt, especially after all that DOUBT on that up and down!
thanks for the laughs!🍻
lol these games are the best .. Sorry Pete lol
"ooooooh hellllooo" is now my go to war chant on the course 🤣🤣
422 par 5?? is that because its a ladies course? only assuming but thought they would have yardage to suit the men too?
That bush shot was dark magic
That was brilliant. Well done guys, Top banter.
Great video, top banter between you both.
Class video, yourself and Pete are making some great content.
The pair of you should do a video similar to MyGolfSpy video on pin in vs pin out. Their science says leave pin in every time.
I’d love to play a round with you and Pete…sadly I live in the US
The way you chip away at each other  (please pardon the pun!) Makes your collaborations so enjoyable, especially this one. Great match up!
That was a lot of fun. Very much enjoyed that.
Oh my God. I can't remember the last time i laughed so much at a golf match. 5 minutes straight laughter. Gasping,  crying laughter. I love you guys
Great video guys, I’ve this type of content and will be doing the half set challenge with the lads no doubt.
422 yds par 5!?
Brilliant Entertainment - you guys are fantastic
Pure class.  Thanks for the belly laughs 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
😂😂😂👍
Hahahahahaha loved it.
The two of you together are better than the sum of your parts. Your banter is so relatable and sounds just like the rest of us playing golf with our mates: brutal and unrelenting ribbing, rather than the super polite professional demonstrations you normally see from other pros.
Love Formby ladies brilliant course and priced properly
Fryer beating Pete was awesome Peter will be hating life at the wedding
Pure enjoyment. The silence from you both as the putt dropped. The Waldorf and Stadler of the YouTube golf world. Always a thumbs up even before the video starts. Keep em coming.
Technically you gentlemen and I speak the same language. But as an American living in Oregon, I truly understand about 1 in 6 words you speak. Which actually makes the video quite interesting.
♥
1 of ya best Matty
Brilliant. The ups and downs of golf 😂
Most enjoyable match I've seen on the tube of late. Well done fellas great banter
Matt! Good job!
Entertainment at its best!
Seriously one of my most favorite videos.
Atta boy
A challenge where you two have one of each type of club. Wood, iron, wedge, putter. Make it round 9 with four clubs.
Matt living rent free in Pete’s head.
You want the flag out, no...*hits flag and pops out* proceeds to power push 3 wood..
Just love.
go play with the other half of the set on petes channel
Can we please please please,.pretty please have loads more content with Matt, Pete amd Carter. By far the most entertaining thing on the internet. Keep up the brilliant work. It's because of you guys that I have dusted my clubs off again.
Gingers rule 👍🏻😂😘
Love you 2 together, it's 10% skill and golf, 90% mind games 😂
that was unreal.. Pete deserved that after hitting 4 iron on the getable par 4
Genuinely belly laughed at matt's first putt and finchys reaction
You guys are so much fun to watch!
This pure and strong will to stay on the bright side, staying positive at all costs under any circumstances - absolutly remarkable! Awesome, Matt!
That was an awesome match - loved every minute and shot. As Pete is going to Edinburgh I am sure he'll feel better soon. Cheers
🤣🤣😂😂 Love the banter!
Well done matt ha ha 😂 👏 👍
That would have to be one of the funniest bantering games of golf I have ever seen. Keep it up boy's really great entertainment, cheers.
Epic ending 😂
Matts putting 👌
daaaaay for it 😍☀
That was absolutely the best banter I have ever heard and fun golf too.
When are we getting a shoe review
Enjoy your wedding Pete.
Wow! What a comeback, off the bushes
👏👏 Yes pal
oh peter ...classic golf karma ...17th tee playing "the game within the game and desperate to win for a good lead in to the weekend " ...so how did that work out for you ? LOL ...love the good nature to the end ...we have all been there ..so many lipouts ..i think you need to appease the golfing gods somehow ....and again i implore you to do a distraction game where you just sledge each other even during swings to see who can still grind a golf shot out
This is a brothers banter and i love it
🤣🤣🤩🤩🤩
Great video guys. Absolutely hilarious. You couldn't have scripted that roller-coaster better. Especially with your personalities and humour.
My game calmed down considerably after I took driver out of the bag.  245 with the 3 wood gets me around a 6,200 yard course in fine fashion & the amount time saved not trying to tame my driver in practice & from not hitting out of grim locations is immense.
That was awesome/ great banter. Great to see two friends having fun.!
You two have some of the best banter in YouTube golf😅
What a great match and very entertaining
When Matt is chirping Pete.  I am matt.  I am that guy
You guys are a lot of fun!
Fryer vs Finch my favorite match! I love the Banter
Wouldn’t want to be sitting at that wedding table this weekend!
One of the best videos I watched in ages. Loved the banter and bickering. More like these please and get Carter in there too🍻
Peter Finch has such thick grips on his irons... why?
I absolutely love the banter that you and pete have, its brilliant and makes the game fun. Easily my fave golf video to date. Thank you for the laughs
Love it fryer love it👍
What’s the long blue thing in Matts bag?!
Get in Matt I cheered when the winning putt dropped 🏆
And... when someone gives you it... Take It! Enough with the tap ins on a 2 inch gimme!
Loved this!
V funny
Funniest video yet! Please play Pete more often! 🤣👌
That was fantastically un-Matt Fryer that... brilliant quote of the day.
Great video boys! Hilarious
"There's not a hurricane on the planet that will save that one." 😆
I know you can’t help it but my god I watch the first 5 min of filming and there was 3 advert blocks sorry lads love your work keep it up but shit the adds are killing YouTube
That shot out of the heather!
tactical golf vs David Blaine underwater escape tricks....well played lads!  :)
Nice one, Matt!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Quality Game!!
Love the banter. That match was just awesome.
I watch all the big UK youtube golfers. There are two thing that set you above the Shiels, Finchs and Carters. Extreme talent, and that perfect mix of tenacity, overconfidence and sardonic self deprecation. Cheers to Fryer.
I love these blog’s between you two as it’s like the weekend banter we all have. “Good shot, did you slip?😂” is the normal put down, or another fairway found, shame it’s not the hole we’re playing. Question is would the putt drop if the flag was out?
Most natural banter between you two and its always entertaining 👍
This was just an awesome video!!
Good, fun content! Also your 'bad' shots are better than my best! Great golf. Great banter.
Laughed all the way through that, brilliant video. Top notch banter 👏
The best "ribbing" ever...
Should have hit 3 wood off the tee 😂
That's was so funny.  Awesome stuff guys.  What a finish.
Great match between two great fellows! Deserved winner, Matt: You did never stop believing. Valuable lesson for us amateur golfers for sure.
Great match!
Great video guys. Would love to see you 2 against the Golf Life boys. You 2 with a half set and Tubes and Ange with a full set and a shot a hole 🙂
Do you guys block book an hour slot from 1st tee or let lots play through?
Only one shot of tequila!  (Matt will understand) 🤣
Quote of the day...."You have to have a wood"...Thank you for the laugh Mr. Fryar...Cheers "I feel I have come out of that hole better than you" ~ Mr. Finch ... lol...
Matt Fryer the Banter King
Hilarious just love these videos. Pete’s face was a picture.
Like always great match between you two.
Well well,what a game! Golf is funny game sometimes!😁
Paid off hitting it out of the heather!
Pete at the end just had me in stitches! Loved this vid! Keep it up!
Brilliant content, love the banter!
My fav video of 2022 so far..   you two should go on tour.. not pga .. comedy tour
🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely love the banter and fun when you both play together, makes for a fantastic video to watch !! Great mates playing chirpy golf, nothing better 👌
Love the banter! You guys are class :)
Peter you doubted The Hulk and given his experience of playing out of the heather on that course.
Different gravy boys .class vid and 🏌‍♂️🏌‍♂️
Peter’s putter sounds terrible.
Why can't you two be on tour instead of these prima donnas arguing about millions!  Much prefer watching these great videos! Thankyou (Nice Putt Matt) 😉
Nice match Matt and way to not give up!! Great birdie putt on the last!!😀
Its always a bad lie when you can't see your own feet! 🤣🤣
Solid!
The amount of visceral ball busting is what we are here for and this was no letdown.
This was absolutely hysterical
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fryer: did you get a dodgey set? 😂
That's the best match I've seen on yt in a long time.
So awesome, you two.
That last roll was perfect.  It felt like it took ages to get to the hole. Loved that there was shots that ended up in places that normal golfers would end up.
🤣 It was a joy to watch. "Is there a hurricane?" Hahahaha!
Brilliant 🤩
I just can't get enough of the videos of you 2, thank you, please keep them coming!
Hey, what mics do you use on your shirts to get your vocal audio? Love the quality man:) thanks
This was a great way to spend 45 minutes. I always end up smiling thanks to you gents, and that's a hell of a great thing to do for people. Thanks Matt and Pete! Wonderful stuff!
Never give up!
Everything else on YouTube is just a disappointment after watching that 😊
Oh my gut hurts from laughing..on the first hole...holy crap guys.
Great job Matt!!!! What a great come back and win! So happy for you Matt!
Lol even the ball dropped in with a level of sarcasm
Always love you two together
What could have been, had quivering Peter not chickened out of hitting 3 wood on 8….
do more of these, like a series like the members of Good Good. These are very entertaining
Love these types of videos
Matt's shit talking is so good. He knows exactly what to say to get under Pete's skin, love these 2 together.
What a comeback!!!!
Matt, so gracious in victory. Pete could learn a thing or two ... 🤣🤣🤣
"ooohh heellloooo!" 🤣So funny.. great match!
Well done Frysy! Great comeback
That was one of the best "Frynchy" videos yet!
That was a classic boys….well done
The chemistry between you two is class.  If Peter thought you were tight with giving puts then he should see what I'm like
This is just pure class. From the both of you. Just the perfect golf youtube video.  I just feel lucky and happiness watching the two of you giving us this masterpiece of video. Thank you so very much. You made my day, my week.  Now I can’t wait playing on Thursday and Friday.  Who knows, I might get sub 20. And if I do, I will give the both of you the honor!  From the very south of Sweden 🇸🇪
Do a one set match. Divide the club's up one at a time .... Someone's getting the putter
I feel so much better about my game now! Thanks Matt!
Getting over Covid, sitting on my deck. Threw up everywhere because I laughed way too hard on the 17th, cleaned up then again on the 18th.... What a roller coaster. Going to to get the hose now, thanks Matt 😜
Great banter......don’t subscribe if you’re from my channel 😂 Pete was living rent free in Matt’s head.......and the best bit.........it was unfurnished 😂 Great win Matt.
Did Finch meet Grant or just Micah... contagious lip outs! There may be a Vax. Jaja
Finally Matt! I've been waiting for ages!
Great banter. Gave me a laugh 😂
WHAT A ENDING WHAT A MATCH
Fryer, the albino blinding strategy.....very sneaky. 👻
The 17th…. Comedic gold and what a tremendous par Fryer!! Awesome finish, lovely to watch!
The banter
Fun!
190k subs well done Matt
Matt, last time I saw legs like that I deep fried em and tossed em in hot sauce
Mr. Fryer, what a recovery on the 17th!!! New 3-W in the offing?
Days like this we just say Golf was the winner on the day
Is this a golf channel?  Not sure what you are playing.  Though my game was just as horrible.
“Obviously Pete’s further away, because he’s hit a worse shot than me.” Hahaha   You two are the Best!!
Excellent match and dialogue/banter!
Love these arch friend games.🤣
Love this vid dude I agree with Brandon the "Get In!"  shouts are feckin hilarious 😂🤣 thoroughly enjoyed this one ⛳🏌️‍♂️
Pete do you carry a shovel to dig a shallow grave. Matt I would watch my mirror on the way home.🤣 Great round Matt.
Hahaha Love to see it haha
Such a good watch, you guys always have me laughing. Well done on another great video and what a finish! 😱😆👏🏻👏🏻
been watching all of your videos for a while (Matt, Pete, and Rick)... This might've been the most entertaining one.
Pete: I am not going to hit 3W and be tactical.. Golf Gods: Watch this.
Love the challenges
hahaha, great stuff - savage finish for the loser!  I'd like to see a 'stingers only' round - including the wedges, basically nothing is allowed to travel above the height of a 3 bed semi!
Hilarious! Well done Matt&Pete! This is what we love to see :D
Perfect entertainment we need more of these!
Love the course vids with you fellas. Not to disappoint you but, it's not the quality of.okay that makes them enjoyable. It's the bants.
Introducing the champion half-set golfer of the year, winner of the beer jug and golden coin chocolate medallion ... (you'll just have to watch to the end)
Well done lads...this was hilarious. You perfectly recreated many of my weekly league matches with mates that I play regularly.
😂😂 Great video guys
best threat ever "i'll snap this club and harpoon it through your chest" fryer 2022
Some of my favorite videos are the Finch & Fryer show. Great banter and class around a course. Keep up the great work guys.
Very funny guys, I enjoyed very much
Loved seeing that trolley going along on its own at 20.59!  Great Video.
This is our last match, I’m done
Hey Matt, just keep on chirping. Love it. Thanks guys
At first, Pete was in Matt's head, and then Matt got into Pete's head. Hilarious match, loved it!
Love this
Thanks again Matt, for keeping doing this videos with The OGs. :)
SUCH A FUNNY VIDEO!!!!
Well, Pete suffered the curse of YouTube by not hitting three wood on 17. Even when Fryer owns his truth he did that. Really fun video. I love the chirping you guys do on the course.
"I actually hate you"
hahaha superb, gamesmanship personified, banter just kept on going
Class content that is. I luv your banter. Cheers mates.
Nice one
That was absolutely epic, loved it. I’m sure it’s all forgotten and you have both moved on already though, yeah right!
Best comedy duo in YouTube golf. Fantastic video, love it when you two get the patter flowing. 😂
Matt yelling "get in" at shots that have absolutely zero chance is my favorite thing on YouTube! It honestly makes me smile every time and often laugh out loud! Great video as always, guys!
Well played both of you. Very Professional.
Why do you talk like a news reporter?
Nice putt.
Brilliant video, one of the best from the group, maybe more without Mr Big shot Shiels? love the banter between you two.
Birdie for the win! Well done sir.
Fair play to Matt getting out of that gorse!
Good vid, thanks - good bants - but I’d have made you move your bag on the last mate…yer out of order there 😁
Chernobyl corner
Great video! Would still love to see a no practice swing video
Love the chemistry you guys had on the course, awesome content.
You could have played a round in the time it took to do the intro. 😅
Matt that was a good match. Great recovery from the gorse bush.
Absolute class🤣🤣🤣
These videos with your group of pro golfers are just great!  Not sure the matchup that is the best between Finch, Fryer, Carter, and Shiels!
Enjoyed that video, isn't Formby Ladies a brilliant course
You two must have shares in this course.
No way #10 is a par 5.
Mr Fryer does not get 😡 anymore!
Don’t worry Matt your worse golf is still better than ricks best 😂😂😂enjoyed the video bud
The banter between you two is the best part!
Some shot out of the heather there!!!
Matt...buddy, them legs whiter than mine.  You should have provided Peter with sun glasses to cut down on the glare.
Did the course start out as a ladies only club or? I've been watching forever and just curious. Happy for another Fryer vid!
Enjoyed my T100s all year. Hope you’ll like them aswell 🏌🏼😃🙌🏼
First
