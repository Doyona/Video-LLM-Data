Me and my sister have watched you for a long time and we love your videos. Do what makes you happy.
I love videos like this
I love you guys sm 💖
Where did gabi get that shirt😭???
this content is the oneee
Gabi, I love how your hair looks 😍😍
even after all the plastic surgery and everything, they look so alike in this video
as someone that knows people that a influencer i can say this is 100% true because l'm not going to say there name but they didn't think what they do makes them happy or they know whats going to make there fans happy
I'm going to be 32 next month, and I JUST came out to my boyfriend and my best friend. Idk if I can come out to my dad tho, he's incredibly judgemental
Thank you for just being here y’all are my hero’s

They got the drama aspect down. That's for sure
Love it this is why I started watching you guys
YES- make a podcast! I’m actually surprised you two haven’t yet. Just really think about what you want to talk about. Like make it about the things you think about and tell absolutely nobody, including even yourselves. Make it something you are passionate about and not something that gives into or feed into any trends/media/what’s popular. Make it REAL and make it you..and include as much about pa as you can because why not?! Pa clearly rocks! 💓✌🏼
Pleaseeee do a podcast
_stark_romanoff_
Yess a podcast would be great. I know i would be listening to it every time!
Niki I’d if you’ve got checked but since I’ve watched you I’ve had the thought you may have adhd. It’s been life changing finding out for me so thought I’d share my thoughts and maybe something helps
Finally a video I could relate too ..
I enjoyed this very much. I felt a more mature chilled vibe.
These girls are lovely
Love this video
I only recently started watching Niki & Gabi so I haven't seen the evolution but I love how open they are being in this video ❤ definitely continue to make these videos and content that makes you happy and not what people want. ❤
Sread the word about god
My favorite video

We love how YouTubers are opening up like this.

The first point about loneliness and strange timetables is something that anyone who is self-employed deals with, rather than being specific to being an influencer I suppose

Niki needs to let gabi talk more
I would love a pod cast
Its not a real proffession get over it, ur a person with a camera that makes content that requires less work, ur job is not stressful, nor is it a thing to be taken seriously, get over urself
It’s very hard to find out who asked.
So when are we getting the story time about dating the same guy from the truth or drink video?? Would be a great video!
YES i love videos like these and a podcast would be great 💜
Influenzers
You both are beautiful and I appreciate your mental health focus and real-ness! It’s so important!

I would download a podcast app just to listen to you two
I am so in love with the new direction you have take the channel. The realness is amazing
I like how they tell us what they are going through and what’s going on in their life 😌
I’m not a podcast person, however if you guys made a podcast I would become a podcast person I love listening to what y’all have to say ❤️
I love videos like this keep going queens ✨✨✨
<3
This setup gives me the morning toast vibes!
Yesssss a podcast
719 dislikes 👎 wow!! It show that 719 haters or have their opinion are opposite what niki and gabi open about influencers.
“Influencer”
First you have to become an influencer

You two are the only you tubers I’ve consistently watched. I’ve been watching you guys since the beginning.
Gabi... makeup, hair, fit, everything in this video 😍 Niki looks amazing too but I feel that this is different for Gabi xoxo
Commenting before watching just to recognise how good both your hairs look 🥵😍
This is such a cancerous video
Cares?
You 2 look like twins but with different hair styles
Have a great day.
You're glowing <3 Thank you for being so honest with us, I'd love to see more videos like this one!
I love this
Gabi your hair is everything! So beautiful 😍

It’s so odd to hear some people unfollow after not seeing videos or posts.  I find myself unfollowing when someone posts soooo much content I can tell they’re not interested in.  I found you guys when you started doing the more honest and open videos and I love them soooo much.
Oh my GODDDDD if you guys do a podcast I will die!! Please do that, seriously!

I WOULD LOVE A PODCAST VIDEO FROM YOU GUYS !!! love the real ness 🤎🤎🤎🤎
You should do a girl talk video like a similar one that laurdiy did. She sat down and answered girl questions while painting something.

I love ur sit down vids
Gabi, your hair though! OMG <3 <3 <3
i loved this
How cool would it be if Niki & Gabi were brunettes at the same time. Someone should edit that together Niki now with 2020 Brunette Gabi
Such a inspirational video love u both keep up the good work 😊
I really hope that they do a podcast, as I love their videos so much. I have been watching Niki and Gabi since I was like ten years old and I am sixteen now. Thank you so much for being like my big sister. 😊💖
I love these girls! I mean just look at them!❤️❤️❤️
I love y’all both so much! ❤️
Love the honesty—-but can we recognize the hair!!! Gabi love the waves 🌊  Niki kickin it with high pony 😁
❤️❤️❤️
NIKI LOOKS SO GOOD
I love this video ❤
Do a podcast!
I love sit down videos!!!
You guys should do a story time muck bang about being influencers and things you’ve went through being influencers
The dark side is it seems you all seem to work very hard to be Just Like Everyone Else. Fighting to be the first to say I’m a cliche! Me too, me too, I’m the same, I’m the best at being the same! I’m a product! I Obey!  Be punk.
Niki you should do a podcast!
thank you sm!
niki literally looks like my fav childhood PollyPocket doll 💅✨
Love the honesty.
I’ve moved from YouTube to twitch and I’m so much happier 💙 my boundaries between social media and the “real world” are so much stronger when I’m limited toa specific space and time frame
Lyyyyy
Gabis hair😍
love this better than your shopping videos bc i've been watching yall since I was like 11 and now im 18... so i'm growing up with you guys
omg podcast videoooooos 😍💜
Podcast video style ✅❤️
I'm excited to see Niki and Gabi feel more comfortable being themselves. I watched them as a young girl so seeing them grow too is lovely.
I agree with the comments asking for a podcast!! It would be a great place to open up and share old stories.
Why is this garbage on trending lol
I love how really you guys are with you subscribers
Who else can see them getting their own reality tv show in the future ?🥺

DOOO A PODCAST♡
niki did WHAT at the bar?!
This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.
Believing youtube is their real life is like believing the movies actors are in are their real life. Every video is curated and nit picked to influence you.
niki and gabi are the realest youtubers out there. i love how they can just be so honest with their viewers, they're the big sisters i never had. ❤︎
i loved this honesty
I love you guys and this is amazing!
Yessss! Pleaseee start a podcast! I would love to listen to you guys when I’m out driving and stuff hehe

deep video. i enjoyed it!! more videos like this
Oh my gosh this is so sad they make millions and bitch and moan like “poor me” be blessed y’all aren’t poor🤞🏻
Great video :) thank you both for sharing and being honest
This video is iconic!
This is probably the most beautiful video you guys have ever made. I love you so very damn much. Xoxo, from Italy
So difficult being an influencer, wow I'm in shock. (Being sarcastic by the way)
You’re not so special and different than others. Get over yourselves. Influencer? What a joke. Who are you?
PLEASE MAKE A PODCAST
so you're telling me that your face is senorita to you? oh god help u
does Niki have a tattoo
Heart Felt song ❤️❤️❤️😝😝
We greatly appreciate you explaining this. This is what we want to hear. This is what we want to see:)
“Know when to put the phone down”
Gabi's hair and makeup in this video tho 😍😍
Thank you so much for being so open to us all 💕
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
niki did what at the bar?!!!!!!
What is an "infuencer"?
I appreciate u guys , yr amazing and I love u so much ! Wishing u good luck in the future ❤
OMG I would be so interested in a podcast! I listen to them when I’m working to pass the time and I the way you guys talk to each other is perfect for a podcast! Always love you guys would be the #1 listener for sure
I love how niki and gabi are so honest with us. They are my comfort you tubers. I appreciate them so much!
Great video! As someone who is trying to grow my channel and be an influencer, it's good to know the dark sides as well. I hope you guys have a nice day
Thank you so much for talking about this!
LOL "the stresses"
This was amazing, you guys are my favourite influencers I watch! Mad respect for you guys!
omg yes to podcast!!! ❤️
I really appreciate your guys honesty <3 and i love seeing your guys more honest videos together lately !! Love it all and always checking for videos from all your guys channels! <3 <3 <3

i cannot get over how STUNNING you both are in this video. wow
I am not an influencer but, this felt like the most honest video this specific topic
Love this I wish It was more in depth 😍💙
I love this!!!
PODCAST!!!!!!
You guys are the best <3 thank you for this video!!!
This is empty and ponderous.
They are killing it with their hair!!!
I wish I was attention starved. And I've noticed these GenZ kids cause more drama for more content and think they're famous.
Thank you ❤️ You guys do so much for your followers, but remember to breath and do what makes you happy!!! Like you said “enjoy the little things”
Their both so pretty I love them they are gorgeous and yes I lean more towards Gabi with style
I love your videos❤️💖
I love that Niki and Gabi are so honest with us. That’s there’s so much behind the cameras. And how much time and effort they put in for us. I can always count on them to give us the tea. 🤍
Every job comes with cons. An “influencer” is not any more difficult then other jobs out there.
Well done for lifting the lid on the influencers life style. X
Who else thinks Niki + gabi should do a podcast on Apple podcasts
You should totally do a podcast for Apple podcasts please
Omg omg I would love a podcast
It’s insane to think that I live so close to Niki and Gabi, and have never gotten to meet them. I’m so sad! I hope someday that I could meet you guys!
❤️
DO PODCAST VIDS ON YOUTUBE!!
As much as I hate the term ‘influencer’, I’m glad you guys are talking about your experiences
i love you too

OMG podcast!!!!!
YES. NIKI AND GABI TAKE PODCASTING- LOL
I'm so happy they did this video 💖 it takes strength. And omg yes podcast!
I pray for all the women affected by the image obsessed industry these two have benefitted from, that contributes to the vanity driven culture you push through photo shoots, instagram and youtube.
Gabi's hair though. My god that part was made for her.
I love how you open up to us, cause that's not as easy as it seems. Keep doing the stuff that makes you happy. When I see you in a video being genuine happy, that will make us happy💙
“You can sit back and enjoy your coffee”....my face because I really am having coffee right now 😳😂.
yessss a podcast would be awesome omg 💗
Daily reminder: You are enough!! God made you for a reason:) Find it
My comfort people.
i would love a video podcast type thing

Oo that sounds so cool i love all theses sit down videos just be your self we love you just way you are i will watch any videos you guys post
Who asked
Yeah bro the demand for content is crazy. Like shit bro have some patience, do people want to see stuff that's good because there's time and passion for it or just some pushed out copy and paste video? Creativity needs space! 👌🏻
they are using  the intro from stranger things, they kinda changed it though and it bothers me a lot
I love your top Niki! Where is it from?
PLEASE make a podcast !!!
Love this so much! & Fuck yes to the podcast.🤩
Podcast video style for sure!

For your weekly video one week y'all should go live at a certain time and just do like a question and answer live and chill/ hang with your subscribers to get to know us and so we can get to know y'all a lil more. You could do it for like an hour or something. You could even start doing it every once in a while as well like when y'all feel like ya need a chill sit down video. This allows for you to get to know your subscribers and what they want/ or look for in your videos. ❤🖤💜❤💜
Niki and Gabi makes me laugh and happy :)
😢
DO A PODCAST VIDEO STYLE!!!!!
Become the next girl code
Love this video!❤︎

I love this video so much it really shows everyone the real shit that happens behind the scenes. And also niki and gabi you guys look freaking stunning 😍
I loved this so much. Not many influencers can open up about this!!

You should start a podcast on Spotify!!!!
Loved thissss
Love the sincerity ❤️ podcast I’d love to listen to you guys
OhMehGoodness I wouldn't mind y'all doing a gf & bf podcast together even if y'all only post once a month
Also I'd love to see you guys do a podcast
Loved this! Thanks for the honesty ❤️
You girls are so amazing for opening up about this! Not many influencers are raw and honest when it comes to these topics, thank you both for the reminder that not everything we see is always picture perfect, Forever Stan you girls 💕🙏🏼
NIKI PLEASE BRING BACK THE TRUTH ABOUT SERIES I LOVED THAT ONE it felt so real and raw
gabis face though its looking strange
Love this!
You guys change faces every single video. So much filler.
When it comes to content, it comes down to what you guys want to post and not making your fans happy. You could post anything and I'd still watch. You should have more control on how you want both your YouTube career to be and your life in general. Love you both and thanks for talking about this.
i swear to god i love y’all 😩❤️
this is such good content
“Your life is special”- Niki, 2021  this made me cry. ily guys so much
dude they are so close rn literally i couldn’t tell their voices apart at one point i love this video sm
This is so true! Just stay strong and happy 😊! ❤️ like if u think this to
it’s the honesty for me✨  but for real though, I love this content, I love their relationship, I love the growth! keep blooming🌹
Love you guys !!
Thank you for speaking out about this.
Love this! ♥️
YES A PODCAST PLEASE
Literally love this omg and yess do more segments ps. Niki and Gavin when the new music comes out we need a dance moment you guys should do a dance song something that we can dance to and feel good about haha 😂 I think that would be so iconic
i love y'all sm
Talking over each other is totally fine and must be a twin thing. We get those comments too.  Watch any Mary-kate and Ashley or Tia and Tamera interview and you'll see them talking over each other and finishing sentences. I love seeing that. This was an awesome video.
Thank  u for  this video  love  your  videos
Please do a podcast!
social climber cough  *teala* cough
I love how open Niki and Gabi are. ❤️❤️❤️

Could you talk about middle school? Just the general topic? Thanks ilysm!
I’ve always respected y’all being honest and coming back to tell things truthfully. It may seem “perfect” at times. But, when y’all are ready, you always come back to say it how it is and give advice. I love seeing y’all be yourselves!

This was a really good video I loved it
the fact that they had the guts to admit that their lives aren’t as glamorous as they seem shows maturity. they’ve grown so much and learned from their mistakes. this is why they’re my role models. they realized what they’ve done in the past and have made so so much better choices. i love you both 💞
I love the genuine and deep videos, SIT DOWN VIDEOS ARE THE BEST💜💜 you guys are so genuine and it must’ve taken a lot to make a video like this ! 💗

While yes demand for content may seem very draining at times. But it’s your guys jobs and you guys should feel very blessed that after all these years you guys still have a demand. That’s what business’s is all about customer demand. You guys are very blessed I know you guys know that. Y’all are dope the new aesthetic is dope. I love that you guys are posting more like day to day content and less challenges it seems more authentic.

I love how open and honest you guys are when you do sit down videos❤️
Do a podcaaaast omg that would be awesome 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Wait a minute....... Why aren’t view and subscriber counts private? They are essentially only needed so that  a creator knows how they are doing on certain video topics and such. Why do they need to be public?
So genuine i love you guys!!!!! Pleaseeee do postcasts or youtube podcasts!!!! Like relationship advice friendships etc!! Anything we love and support xoxoox

I love your guys hair 💖
Such a wholesome video 🤍
Please make a podcast!!

yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees podcast
Start a podcast
Gabi looks beautiful without hair extensions
Thank you for being so honest with us❤️❤️
❤✨Appreciation for you guys. Its really hard being an influencer😭. I love uh Both
I love the podcast video style! Super into the deep talks and relatability. Life is too short to worry about what others say or think about you. Live life on your own terms. I personally love how this channel keeps it real. Keep doing you, Niki and Gabi!  Hope you can ‘influence’ more positivity to your platform 💜
Why do influencers not listen? They  do whatever they like, like they’re entitled to do anything.....then get upset when they lose followers.....makes a sorry video....then do it again? Confusing!!
I love yall bitches
This is so refreshing. Would love a podcast
Wow
10:42 Niki I lived for that moment🥲
I’m all for the podcast
Love you guys🥰 You’re both glowing!
arff
is gabi wearing jeans!? I LOVE IT!

NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY !!!
This is probably my favourite video they have ever posted because you can see the way the care for everyone and have the confidence and bravery to open up to the whole world
I saw the they posted and screamed. I heard my mom say to my dad in the other room "Niki and Gabi posted"
I’d love a podcast!
Did they mention where they got that Neon light from? It's so cute I want one. It would really spice up my room. I'm into neon lighting stuff rn. I'm so weird. I want to make videos about decor or books or both. Lol I'm weird but I kinda like it. Wow that's the nicest thing I've said to myself in awhile.....
Yessss do the podcast🤩
i LOVED their hair in this video!!!
Hello
I love when they do sit downs it helps me love them more and more!
WE WANT A PODCAST! 😍😱
You are amazing and it is so appreciated that you do open up to us. Love you ❤️xo
This is amazing! It’s all very different from what I expected, I was used without needing to be famous-
Gabi’s hair looks amazing💗
okay but I love how much they've grown individually AND within their own relationship with each other 🥺
just be you because you are beautiful
Those things can be helpful but they are extremely damaging as well
Yes Niki I live for sit down videos

Wow, this vid is exactly 15:00 minutes
Can we appreciate all they’ve done?
please do a series reacting to older videos! showing bloopers/ arguments that happened when filming them and tell us what was actually happening behind the scenes ♡ ♡ ♡
This is sad people need to treat them like real people normal people
Omg I’m from Bethlehem!
AM I..........EARLY? 🔥🔥
this is actually my favourite video they have posted in YEARS
I love you niki and gabi <3
Please start a podcast you guys truly look like you're in a good sister relationship and we'd love to listen to you guy's podcast

I clicked way to fast
ily
WE NEED MORE INFORMATIVE CONTENT LIKE THAT. -stay positive 🦋❤️
never clicked so fast!
Gabi’s hair!😍😍😍😍😍
When niki said where not kids anymore my brain went STRANGER THINGS 😂
When you're trying to be an influencer yourself and see this video title to add to the anxious feelings but you click it anyway bc its Niki and Gabi. I want these girls to be happy 😊
I love how you both are so honest, love that you both are now being authentically yourselves!
yall be like “influencers are stigmatized as being tone deaf 😔” and then make a tone deaf video 😐
Sometimes we need these talks x
Omg hi Nicki and gabi I love you so much I have been watching you from the start k bye and it is my birthday on Friday love yall 💋btw I am this Zodiac ♉️to bye 💜💛❤️

You’re an awesome YouTube channel.
Y’all forgot niki’s handle 😂😭
