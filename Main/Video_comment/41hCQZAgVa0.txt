lol Next Question
The lion also has fangs. claws, incredible speed, agility and power and is engineered to be a killing machine with no fear...the cow, well... it provides milk. Still it was a great pep talk.
I know Gane is soft spoken but it almost seems the mic's audio were lowered, but as soon as Dana gets on the mic is loud as a mother fucker lol
Anyone else love the way Jon explains shit and talks during the press conferences? glad the goat is back.
"he didn't make weight. i don't give a shit. i'm paying him anyway".........way to shit on everyone else who's professional
Man Alexa looks mean, I'm serious she's has an intimidating presence, truly makes me wonder her backstory, but she fights with great pressure, her boxing and takedown defense was just amazing to see, she's very well rounded and I even put money on Shevchenko, shouldn't have glanced over grasso like that, lesson learned. Viva 🇲🇽
he did great <3
I also saw that Bo Nickel knee to the groin before take down of Pickett but since it didn't hit the guard and didn't make any noise so the referee let it go. Jon Jones will always be evil and a bad person no matter how many times he says 'Jesus Christ'. He was cocky and brutal to Gane always calling him Gain. It is a matter of time before Jon Jones slips again. Gane had already lost to him before the fight calling Jones the GOAT and saying "If I win" again and again during pressers as that shows the lack of confidence. Miocic wouldn't be a good challenge for Jones as he also lacks confidence. A Russian wrestler like Sergei Pavlovich would be a great challenge next for Jones...
Gotta love Mexican fighters........3 champions, beating Russians, rising up.
1:19 ish. Ask me again, I'm sorry. That's a professional cunt trying to be humble, needing time to be 'correct'  Damn he's smart, calculated and manipulative. This truly is one of the most dangerous men on the planet (physically)  I hope he believes in the strength of family love and does everything in his power to respect it.  If this prick suddenly dedicates his life to live rather than war, he's going to achieve truly special things  IMO 🤷 🙃
He's full of shit, God this God that, we've heard this before and he's beat his wife, hit pregnant woman in a car accident, fires a gun near the homeless drunk. Let's see Jon live his God life and not just say it.
Disappointed that he's only a kickboxing. Francis proved that Gane had no ground game. The hype of Gane was overhyped!! He is know where near the fighter they have tried to portray him as being. He needs to go and spend some serious time on gis grappling.
SHHHH NOONE MENTION FRANCIS THE PREDATOR NGANOUU.
2:43 😂
Is Jon running for Governor?
nganou will beat the shit out of jones
Ya but what is Jon on lol that’s what we all want to know.
"All that muscle, with a big ol p*ssy" I thought he was talking about Gabby Garcia 😆
wasn t the ufc restricting divinity invocation in the octogon?  I don't give a shaite about religion  , but i remember since the khabib days , when ‎Inshallahahaha  was basically eradicated. Inever ever heard it since.I am guessing jesus pays better , huh ? LMFAO , don't read to much into it , but is just funny.
Jon jones - I’m in it for challenges (Moves up to heavyweight)  Khabib gets asked if he would fight khamzat at 170 “ I don’t think so ,you know why this is? he is 170, I an 155.  (Walks naturally almost 200 lbs)
Gane got paid to be beaten by Jon, like Conor’s some opponents been paid to be beaten by him too 😅
Person talking in the back ground is really unacceptable 3:38
Shavkar should not think about title after that kazahstan speach
Dana beats his wife😊
We want ngannou vs jones
Weakest title fight ever 😂 Jones is a great fighter but just so full of shi!t on the mic 😂. He’s one of those dudes that says “O my goodness” tries not to curse then leaves church to go cheat on his wife then smacks her around when questioned 🤦‍♂️
Francis erases Jones from time.
Jon jones is the goat that’s solidified now for sure
This grasso is getting FFFFFFFD UP trust me she only done pissed of Valentina trust MEEEEEEEEEEEEE - 🤌🏽
Hang on a second...apart from.being another Mexican baby faced assasin, Alexa speaks 3 languages fluently?? This woman has the world at her feet. I know Valentina also spoke Russian, English, Spanish and pretty good at Thai...it's like they are just shpwing off now (obviously I'm playing with that comment) 😂😂
Its so weird that the woman that just beat arguably the greatest female fighter of all time is an absolute sweetheart of a person!! It's amazing how many of these bad mo-fo's are just really nice people. Alexa is so marketable as a cute, sweet...KILLER!! The fact, like Valentina, that she speaks English so well means that they can market her so easily around the world
Ahhh man, how can we not like Cyril. He is such a nice, polite guy!!
Love that sinole one word answer, who you thi k will win,everyone expecting a few words... "Burns" Gets up and leaves. I like this kid Rakhmanovodov
2 minutes get yo ass out of here? What was that??? Lol
how many buttons does he need lol😂
i wanta see Jon Jones become Champ Champ 🙌  but i must say 3 years to bulk up for heavyweight class seems excessive...     daniel Cormier just jumped to heavyweight after winning the light heavyweight belt and won both . i always wondered why Jon Jones couldnt have done it too when he best cormier twice
Gane doesn’t appear too be the type of fighter that can bounce back mentally after a loss. He’s a phenomenal talent. But I’ve been watching UFC since the first show ever. The one thing that ends careers more than injuries and retirement is the inability to bounce back mentally after a loss. I’m a huge fan of Bones. Always have been. But I wish this kid luck in his journey. Getting beat up in front of millions of people isn’t easy too come back from. It’s embarrassing when it shouldn’t be. Great event.
You call out à killer and you laught...
Jones still as fake and as narcissistic as ever
Bury Power Slap. Canonize Alexa Grasso!
2:02:43 "This is war and there's no mercy. Guys, mercy." Lol
So damn happy for Alexa, she deserved this. VIVA MEXICO! 1:05:48
The journalist who asked about power slap is a shill
Dam Geoff neal took a double L missed weight lost 20% of his purse and lost the fight dam! He’ll be back
Thank you for the entertainment to all fighters loved the card Dana 💯
Dana white saying Jon jones should be on Nike commercials, when he’s the reason he’s no longer  sponsored by Nike smh 🤣 🤦🏿‍♂️
Pretty dumb question asking if Valentina will fight Amanda? First Valentina lost and in different division.  Makes zero sense.
Great performance and result for Jones,  but I wish he'd stop the religious preaching.
As someone that has been hyper critical of JJ, keep doing your thing brother. We all aspire to be better tomorrow than we are today and I respect the hell out of the fact that that's what you're trying to do.   Godspeed champ.
Dana went home and beat his wife
The 🐐 and for him to say kick boxing and striking might take a back seat and he is gonna grapple and wrestle more is genius and scary for everybody else. He has  already proved his striking and kickboxing skills!
I don't think anyone can beat jones ever. He is just to good man. Maybe pavlevic but I can see anyone touching him.
There was a LOT of bad reffing in UFC 285.
Another stupid ass question from the french journalist...
So  jones future fights will be  first stiipe and after  Sergei Pavlovich......
Who's Stoppin That....
I was telling all my friends it was gonna be a work just before it started. Ganes demeanor gave it all away. It was written all over his face as he came out of the tunnel and during the introductions he slowly paced back and forth staring at the floor. He never behaves like that prefight. Then in the face off he could barely look Jones in the eyes. Gone was the confident happy go lucky attitude he had all week leading up. He was approached backstage and told to lose. I wouldn't be surprised if they forced him to rehearse the finishing sequence backstage with Jones.   Look for Gane to buy a nice house with his fat losing check just like all the opponents that laid down for the leprechaun. Also take note of how morally bankrupt the Disney owned UFC is. Barely a year removed from him beating the shit out of his fiance in front of their kids and they're willing to fix his fight to put him on top of the game again. Their greed has no boundaries and shekels are all that matters. They will continue to do what's best for business and get away with it because of their army of clueless fans who believe whatever they see on TV. The whole worlds a stage.
I hate Jon jones but he is the goat and has always been
Everybody look at the octagon around the 30 year symbol. Do you think it would be better to make two of the sides parallel to each other just a bit longer just to give more range for the fight?  I think it should be longer on two sides.
Shavkat should not be taking on Colby next. Neal missing weight was because this guy is so damned big for the weight class. I would bet that.  No other reason he missed by that many pounds. But Neal is still one of the baddest MFers at WW and there is one problem Neal has.... he is too willing to brawl every time. That is going to catch up to him.  He can win more fights removing the aspect of brawling.
Jon now looks like Denzel Washington and talks like Muhammad Ali. Not a bad combination!
why can’t dana just say jon wants to be paid more and dana/ufc doesn’t want to pay jon more and that’s why jon doesn’t fight often. It always comes down to money why fights don’t happen with jon jones cuz Jon ain’t scared of anyone
$80 for this
Jon Jones sounds like a psycho......He definitely does not sound happy no matter how much he claims he is. Sound like a future robot that is lying to you about something. Completely devoid of emotion but is trying to sound like its having the time of its life.
😂 That was a great. No, I'm not sorry to the French fans. This is Combat this is War & there is No Mercy. But hang on 1 sec I do got some Merci right here for ya, bye guys! ::proceeds to button his WarMaster General Washington suit jacket::
Gane is great.
Where was Valentina post fight conference interview?
Uncle Dana we need a Seattle card in our new arena!!
That Gane thinks the loss to Ngannou wasn't a real loss means he learnt nothing from that fight, his grappling is still terrible and he went in there against Jones who is a superior grappler to Ngannou of course this is the result.
💯💯🫡
Why was Jon so offended when he was asked about Drake's bet?
that was the most pathetic performance i have ever seen from a heavy weight
Dana tries to discredit Ngannou every chance he gets now.
I will always love Jon Jones.. like he's just the best
Can we all agree that Herb Dean is the most terrible ref in the game? They only let him work one fight.
The reason Jones has great men & women in his life is because of his ability to make money for them, plain & simple! He's turned into a Bible Thumper, & thinks it's god that blessed him to win his fights. It's as simple as he inherited good genetics then exploited his potential
Irony Jon mentioning illegal moves esp hitting the back of the head 😆
would love to see Jones going down LHW and fight Jiri for the title
This was a great card, great PPV, never bought a Jon Jones event before, never jumped on the hype train, guess I'm a bit late to the party🫣 that was definitely impressive for man to jump a weight class and be out of the game for 3 years 🤯 worth every penny 💯🇺🇲💪
Jon Jones does have a loss. It's against Matt Hamill
Did this fucken guy just say Jones looks like the greatest HW ever?!?! C'mon man. He looked horrible. Ntm this was his first fight. Dana should know better than that. Throwing those words around like that take away their legitimacy. Imho.
Dana needs some consistency, make it a rule if you miss weight but hit a bonus your loss percentage is applied to the fight too! Make every pound over 5% off or something. *shrugs*
Usman, Nunes, Israel,Shev eventually the best lose. People don't understand its hard to be champion your entire career, the champ only fights the best. That doesn't mean when they lose they're a bum it just will eventually happen. But man, it all happening within a year of each other is wild so far Amanda got hers back. Just amazing how quick things can switch from 3 African champs to 3 Mexican champs the UFC has been very interesting.
Lol....the people in the back getting picked up on the mic I heard  "get yo a$$ up outta here" 🤣🤣🤣
the greatest of them all. our country is proud. USA lets go! 🇺🇸 👑
Grasso is Italian for fat. Ironic considering how skinny she is
Pretty obvious Jon won because he had a picogram of extra tape on his toe
Love u Alexa Grasso!
Cyril needs to move to the US to reach his full potential,that's the same reason Francis left MMA factory
The energy that escapes Jon when he talks about Stipe is incredible. He knows what beating the best UFC heavyweight would do for his legacy, especially at this point. And he knows it's close.
Jon Jones is Not the goat. He fought nobodies. I dont know one of the fighters he ever fought. I only know Conor mc Gregor and Jake Paul.he didnt Beat Conor and Jake so Conor, Jake, Logan and KSI are the best Fighters of all time.   Anyone who disagrees with me has No knowledge of Fight Game and I hate men, cause transgender are best people in the world. My Penis Burns when I pee is that normal? It is 2inches so big dick what now?
Jake's defo on the secret juice
feels so fucking weird hearing someone call Jon Jones short and how it makes sense
Yeah but mma is a sport power slap isn’t complete opposite
Nobody ever accused Jon Jones of being humble also did you see how scared stipe looked when he called him out in the crowd
*Brock Lesnar enters the chat*
GOAT doing GOAT things. Unreal. Grasso outstriking shevchenko was just amazing. Loved the event.
I hate hearing Kevin lole ask questions they’re always so bad
What a star Grasso is & she speaks at least three languages fluently too!
Jones is good at fighting and drugs.
Why’s the volume always low during post fights ? Like jeez someone needs to be fired
Jones said Christians are perfect well they would of been if would of been follow the Jewish tradition and not follow the Roman’s imposition through all this centuries that have nothing to do with the original roots of the Jewish Christians movement back in the ended of the first century .
Should Jon's record be 28-0 or 29-0?
2:43 wtf was that 😂
Hard to believe my first MMA crush would beat Valentina Shevchenko.  I'm still not sorry I picked against her.  Alexa Grasso is a good fighter, but Is she really going to be able to win the rematch?
Like Dana said; Dealing with Jones is like dealing with an artist!
31:51 what a waste of a question honestly lady is that the best question you could think of… woah really blows my mind some of the pointless questions that get asked in these pressers
As a person, Jones is Trailer Trash compared to Cyril Gane However, Jones is undoubtedly an incredibly talented fighter!
1:49:37 uncle Chael was right
I 100% agree with Alexa grasso women need that discipline she speaking someone red pill game probably don’t even know it
I seen a comment someone called Valentina a trans that’s cold she’s stays in shape she what many petite women even some thick joints would look like if all u do is train be honest it’s manly looking women she looks more appealing physically at 135 to 145 throwing shade on her cause she is a easy target a accomplished champ who lost
I thought the slap finale happened during Dana’s Mexico vacation
Jons could run for president with this fake personality i think im the only one who can see through him nobody is commenting about it great fight though🔥
Jon is wearing a like a fucking 1800's captain jacket lol
My head told Jones would win, but my heart was with Cyril Cyril is SO MUCH more of a Respectul, Well Rounded, Decent person than Jones! I feel Cyril will fix his weaknesses & remain a Dominant Force in UFC! I wish him the BEST!
Jon Jones is the GOAT!
I wish I could be submitted by alexa
I can hardly wait to see how "Off the Rails" Jones will go celebrating his win!
Jones FAKE CHAMP Francis Ngannou REAL CHAMP
Praise Jesus Christ for raising up the greatest combat athletes of all time! The GOAT Jon Jones! no one will ever be better
Top 5 Goat list:  1: Jones 2: Silva 3: GSP 4:Khabib 5: Nunes  And Jon Jones is the Goat Of All Goats!
I came here just to say, ¡Viva México!  Grasso now makes 3 Mexican champs.  We now need Irene Aldaña.  Vamos, Latinoamérica.
How does the reporter not follow up on the Francis being a big ol pussy statement !!?!? He was so caught up and asking his question he didn’t allow Jon to continue ranting and cutting promos !!!
You are welcome :) lol
Not trying to stir the pot but why do they say Jon Jones has never lost when he got busted for drug cheating (NC), and illegal elbows in another (NC)? I thought cheating and an NC was a loss since it isn't a win? (I honestly don't know). Anyway, I just watched him fight for the first time and never heard anyone address that. Thank you.
Jones vs Stipe is going to be a great fight. Hope we don’t have to wait 6-12 months, Jones got out unscratched tonight so he can be ready for the next fight in 3-4 months time
Goat of all goatss jones
What's up with all the Francis bashing.....?  I know it's post event and dana is s promoter but..... how soon we forget.
Alexa is the Real face of mma this time. Fuck that Phenom ! : )
If you fail multiple drug tests and hide under the cage to avoid being tested, you're no GOAT, you're a cheater and that's it
One thing is VERY clear. Jon Jones is terrified of Sergei Pavlovich. he'll fight Stipe, and bounce before he has to fight the real test in heavyweight right now. Sergei
Grasso!  Been watching and waiting Alexa from her early UCF beginnings. Congratulations Champ
Valentina 💔
UFC WE NEED TRANSLATORS
17:15.    ALR GANG
Repent to Jesus Christ “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭18‬:‭20‬ ‭NIV‬‬ Y
jones stand up seems to have disappeared so he will have to wrestle
Was a great night of fights. The Alexa Grasso win then Jon makes his Heavyweight debut and makes it look easy. Wow
Almost cried? Lol tough man aye
Why is the audio so low?
Wow Neal missed weight by 4 pounds and still lost the fight that’s embarrassing
“Great Life Decisions” Jones finally beats someone without a spinning elbow to the back of their head! Can’t wait to hear what drugs he’s on before or after the fight. Dudes a pice of shit.
O thing but respect for Gane. He literally still praised home sun defeat. Very stand up guy
That Francis tweet got under Jon's skin, look at his body language after...
They need a whole team to get jon to the airport on a B line lol
ciryl keep your head up! U did not lose to a bum that man is the best in the world! Change coaches and you will be fine!
Stipe got short hands he got no chance . Only Nganou is thread for Jon .
Ce va bien, et tu?
Jones vs Pavlovich is the only fight which really makes sense at heavyweight.This is it and this is all.That simple.
BONJOUR COMMENT CA VA. omg the GOAT
Have he sat wit Mike Tyson yet?
Jones TOE Tape lasted longer then Gane.😢😮
Misses weight by 4 lbs gets beat and still gets a bonus wtf Dana get your shit together you can't keep paying these guys that miss weight they don't care about the pay cut they would rather win
Uncle Dana had fun at Colby’s after party
UFC is mcdonnalds of sports. low quality ingredients. cheap product. dana is a parasite
Jon went from a villain to a hero, man I love the dude, keep it up champ.
Grasso was AMAZING
great audio...
Damn man I hope Jon Jones has a son
Do September 16 Dana,  Mexican Independence Day.
Lmao all this humble talk and then calls Ngannou a pussy a second later
Bro she speaks Portuguese too beast beast beast
jon jones never lost... except when he clearly broke the rules and got DQd.   That's a loss.
does Jon have beef with drake??
jones only talks real shit when the other person is either no longer fighting or in the organization. people are stupid if they think this the ufc is better off without francis. dude never ran from anyone. he sacrificed himself for the bros.. yet jones sits up there and calls him a pussy while praising god?? you talk about mistakes.. francis hasn’t made the ones you have.. so put out the same respect you do for the other guys. not just talk shit to the guys you would avoid in public.
"Gane is a bum" hahahahaha. I'd like to see you last 3 seconds in his world
Jon Jones has always said the "right" things and he still does.  It's unfortunate he doesn't live those things.
Nice jacket Jon 😍. Congrats. Jon reminds me of Samson in the Bible. 🇪🇨🙏🏽🌎
Nobody is surprised that the French tapped out again 😂
I imagine Stipe will be more of a test for him but I still see him getting it done. A strong big Jones is dangerous when he gets him hands on you.
lol Jones seemed to get a littl mad at the drake bet comment. wonder what that was about
With jones on top gane might really have to consider dropping down a weight if I ever wants gold
Jon ain’t lying tho 💪 🐱 😅
Yo who heard that shit in beginning 2 minutes get your ass outta here lol 😂
Lmao i got worried if we were waiting for jones like did he get arrested before the press conference? congrats to the 🐐😂😂
Real boogeyman ☠️ shavkat 🔥
Jon has really matured and developed as a human and Christian. I always had faith in him and liked him, even when he was considered a bad boy. Grasso is a humble badass for sure. Mexicans have always been good fighters, just mostly in boxing.
Man, Alexa speaking in her 2nd language about learning a 3rd language is awesome, super skilled and super intelligent.
He is 100 percent correct about being more relatable. We love your faults Jon. We are all sinners
Pickett- "groin shot to takedown! I like your style" 😂
Jones foot injury vs Gane hand injury ?!? Was that just a WWE match in the end ?!?! 🥲
Last night was EPIC!  AND NEWWWWW!
That one reporter who asked about Powerslap was such a pussy. "I like the product." "I like the product." "Please don't take my press pass, Dana.".
Sup with the toe tape thing? Fighters wear foot wraps all the time, i dont see the problem.....
This is a sad event. It's the event the UFC community basically unanimously admitted, it doesn't matter if you cheat your way to the top, just as long as you keep winning. Everybody from Dana White to Joe Rogan, Jon Anik, Michael Bisping, as well as most the fan base says Jon is the undisputed GOAT. So next time someone pops, just know it really doesn't matter that much. UFC is not a brand where it matters.
Imagine… Islam goes up to fight Shavkhat
It’s crazy how nobody is questioning jones champ status since he never beat the previous champ. DC got all that criticism when he didn’t beat jones for it but all I hear are crickets so far
Wow you can see the instant when dana got an erection for jones
Khabib GSP goats. This man popped not once but twice
Bo’s win started with a groin shot that the ref missed
I’m impressed enough with a person speaking 2 languages fluently. Alexa Grasso up there answering questions in 3 languages. Pretty cool!
John Jones = 📈💰📈💰📈💰
Yeaaah I'm sure Chandler and Connor dislike each other now. It's not just for the hype for sure...
Slap league is completely unsustainable. Dana still trying to make parallels between them is such a joke. Just stop
I think John has turned a new page, looking up to great leaders, dads, and people in leadership roles. I think that's a great insight to have and strive for. I think that thought process will really guide him through a successful career.
Francis Ngannou had full stinky pants, that's why he's gone
Him ignoring the question about the Drake curse was golden 😂
Breaking News jon Jones just got arrested for 2 transgender prostitutes and an 8 ball of coke.
Dang Darren Till said he wasn’t good enough anymore to compete in the UFC haha
Does Jon not like Drake? He just completely dismissed the Drake question 😂
Alexxaaaaaa
Matt Hamil enters chat…
2:44: Listen to what you can hear on the microphone in the background
Listen at 2:44 someone says “get you’re ass up out of here”
Jones found Jesus.....Thats funny
GSP was the goat. He also got caught greasing. Khabib didn't face the highest level in even the lightweights. Even GSP crossed weight classes. I know a lot of people don't like admitting it but Quarry, Maia, lutter, Irvine, Cote were all gimmies. So yeah that's what I think of Anderson's record. Jones with all the BS still fought the highest level and retired multiple goats, never lost ( just a bullshit DQ in a fight he was dominating). Cheers
Imagine u destroy few generations of fighters 🔥🔥🔥👌goat!!
Am I the only person that thinks most these reporters are brain dead groupies?! It feels  like a comic con meetNgreet at these conferences
Jesus Jones the GOAT. This card blew me away. ALEXA THOUGH!!!
“Francis is a big ol pussy” “all that muscle and a big ol pussy” -Jones on Francis 🤣😭
Dana got a little bit of that social media money and now he’s stoked off it haha
Knowing Jon, saying anything about his style being a certain way moving forward is a total fakeout. This guy is always playing the game. Goat for a reason
Do Jones vs Stipe in Ohio for Stipe last fight
feel sorry for Ciryl, but even more for Frank
Dana sucking up to Jones hard hahaha he might ask him to marry him after last night
2:44 wtf lol why does that sound like Bobby green.
Greetings in French was a good mix of old school poke ya Johnny Bones with the new school mature Johnny. Has he really matured? Time will tell, but I'm betting that he has indeed grown mentally, physically, and spiritually.
Just want to say, this was the best UFC post fight press conference in the history of the UFC. Dana and Jon Jones are in their absolute prime form. Dana's interview here is must see TV, he's one of the funniest, most entertaining people in the business. Dana seems to be sharper than ever, because he answered so many questions here, and added so much substance to the entire sport with all of his insights. Dana could have just said a few words, then went home, but he put in a lot of effort here to answer questions. The same with Jon Jones. Jon went way above and beyond, and was extremely insightful. And Jon also sold the fight with Stipe in a huge way, and also sold a fight with Francis in a big way. Dana and Jon Jones made this the greatest post fight presser, of all time.
That's funny, "Charter a jet right now and get him home." About John Jones. No shit!!!
No-one talking about the knee to the balls from Bo Nickal. Cheater
Ha ! Ha ! Ha !  Dana selling his product when saying that Francis can't be compared to Jon...
I like the old Jon Jones, but the new Jon Jones is just 100% REAL , humble and deadly.. He's got a magical combo and I expect him to impress even more in the future.
give him the money honey
BO Nichols kicks or knees opponent in the nuts and clearly the guy feels it goes down gets submitted and no ones says anything.
Gane seems like a good dude, I hope he stays around for a while
I don't believe jones will do well in the heavy weight division!
"great condition" he worked for 2m and was sweating and panting like a 5 rounds fight at the end.. that was weird tbh
Jon would do the same thing to Francis, good choice for him to leave so he can talk shit now and not have to back it up.
2 minutes get the fuq outta here
Jon the lord has been with you throughout your journey and he blessed you with a smooth victory!
High IQ move from Jon Jones when he wrapped up the French fans question with "this is war, no mercy" and then says "MERCI" have a good night! Slick pun!
Well yea jones u had 3yrs to get rdy for heavyweight and u show up with a super gut come on bro glad ur back but wtf with the dad bod..??
I thank my Lord and savior Jesus Christ, I'm grateful so on and so forth. This dude has been a piece of shit his whole life, on top of being a great fighter. SMFH
Val!!!!!
And then he talks🙄. Why is it when Jon talks it feels so contrived and false but he is the absolute goat! Fantastic fight just wish he’d leave the thanking of his lord and savior out of it. His behavior tells us who he is.
So Gane didn't even show ? I guess he didn't show for the fight either.
How come Jon Jones has many children with his fiancee? Kids will be known as "bastards" which pertains to a person that's unmarried and has children. Get married GOAT.
At the end of the day these guys are fighters! The occupation is violent, there will always be flaws in some of their personalities.
Bald jones has always been a mythical fighter 🔥
Dana looks sick and old. He's probably on his way out. RIP Too much stress.
Worst audio of all time coupled with 4 ads a minute. Sweet.
Shavkat…future champ no doubt.
I hope this isn’t an act and Bones has changed. He’s such an amazing and gifted athlete, his only kryptonite is himself. 🐐
Can anyone explain why you like Jon Jones after everything he's done outside the octagon? I just don't know why some people ignore that aspect
Jones is soooo cheesy.
I wanna see him against alistair oveereem right now....i wanna see him against a real bigger fighter than him...maybe volkov too a real test for the goat
WTF Alexa Grasso speaks Portuguese!!! <3
Audio issues still undefeated
UFC RIGGIN!
Jon in an interesting guy. I don’t want to say he’s fake, but the true Jon Jones deep down inside is an animal, like a modern day Viking, he’s a savage. He tries to hide by smiling, talking about family, etc but that’s not the real him. When he heard about the Francis tweet he almost lost his composure, the mask slipped. He couldn’t even focus on the next question. I’m not bashing him, I like him. The savage inside of him is what’s made him the 🐐 Keep that mask on Jon
Jon allegedly beats his wife in front of his kid, but tonight he’s a hero. 🎉
I would imagine the UFC have under the table cash deals with their biggest stars. Francis blew any chance of earning a name. His appearance in Jackass really was his peak
Alexa knows three languages, so she’s cute, a bad ass, and intelligent. Guys she’s a catch for sure. Wifey material
A fighter who has been positive for steroid use then received a 1 yeae suspension can never be the goat, once a cheat always a cheat! For me its khabib or GSP
What's the over/under on Jones popping for steroids and cocaine, and how many days after this will Dana White come off like Ralph Kramden, or call everyone a goof (meanwhile acting like a goof) trying to cover up for Jones yet again??
😂 The talking in the background at the beginning.😆
My Sensei - "You can go to a regular gym and look like a body builder, or train here and create real strength"
How long until Jon Jones gets in trouble for drug use, speeding, or beating his wife?
Jon is the goat
Glad to see Jon Jones back. Congrats to Jones and I believe he will beat stipe as well stipe is good on the feet on the ground his game is in the basement. And with Jones a big problem on the ground. Stipe got some ring rust he ain't fought in a while and he isn't Jon Jones. And stipe wrestling isn't on par with Jon Jones facts. I will waiting to see Jones take stipe as he better than stipe. Facts!!!
Congrats to Grosso, that was incredible
Бой с Нилом показал что Шавкату,ещё рано на титул явно,этот бой он провел слабенько
What's the odds of beating somebody from France to be champ, and not fighting the actual champ whose name is Francis...  A Cameroonian that trained as a boxer in France and beat a former kickboxer from france but speaks better english. Then you have the French dude last name being "Gane"... And the African dude last name being N"gann"ou.... Wtf is this matrix doing?
Kindof flukey. Hopefully they get to rematch. They’ll meet again I’m sure, just sucks that it probably won’t be for upwards of 2 years I’d guess.
“2 minutes! Get you ass up outta here!” Lol
Personally we have always Related to jon .we are not perfect in life .yet we strive for it in war
As much as I like the humble Jon, I still can’t help, every time he starts talking, replaying “you still there pussy” in my head. I just don’t know if it’s authentic now or it’s a ploy 😂
Stipe is easy work for Jones
greatest UFC fighter ever, Dana is right, why doesn't he have a shoe deal?
Talking about not wanting any dirty fighting when he is literally the dirtiest fighter😂
Congrats to all the fighters at ufc I must say you guys needs lay off the monster that shit is liquid death that's facts and can prove it.
JJ the GOAT. Until July.
Cyril you dont just need a high level wrestler. You need a high level MMA wrestler!!! Somebody ho really understand the game like DC, or Jon Jones, or ofcorse Khabib
Mexico has unified the ufc belts.
Grasso out boxed and wrestled valentina
Ita kinda hard for Cyril to be disappointed in himself and his performance when he didnt even had time to do anything! Jones is on another level baby!
“Imagine that” good job Alexa!
L
Jon Jones is a skilled fighter, and he got caught taking Steroids more than once!!!!!! He can for that reason never ever be GOAT.
So humble she forgot her belt
Valentina won the fight she just got caught. So Dana wtf you mean grass executed perfectly lol
I was saying Gane hit JDS and Tai in the back of their heads leading to both victory's and someone was arguing with me, glad to see Jones himself also noticed that.
Did you guys see how white Steve looked while Jon was describing what he had in store for him?
Slap League is a ketchup popsicle, and I wear white gloves
Ganes sparring partner ares there for him to look good. Middleweights maybe light heavys. Needs good partners
Gane will never touch that belt again as long as John is in that weight class
Leave it to the French to make an excuse for losing within the first 30 seconds of the discussion.
2:03 Grasso speaks Portuguese
UFC rigged again
Try calling islam the p4p now 😂😂😂😂
Anic the best commentator. dc and rogan didnt give grasso any love
Shoutout to Dana for not pronouncing the second T in Toronto. He’s alright in my books
Who cares about thr under card people I mean really?
Thank god Dana is back. Press conference was shitty without him. He was right lmaoo
I tell you what ... jon's attitude changed when the whole Francis tweet come up you could see it pissed him off! The rest of his interview was probably him thinking about killing Francis lol
Bo nickal knee to the groin!
I’m just saying he took no damage he wiped out gane in three minutes, please don’t wait no year and a half for another fight  Get back in 6 months
Was there live on the floor! Such a great night, something I’ll never forget!
Really nice to see Jon and Dana back together again, especially after both of their domestic violence incidents, everyone deserves a second chance.
so glad neal got the bonus still. w dana
Dana hyping up Jon as the "best heavyweight ever" after ONE FIGHT against a medicoer fighter..
ChampagnePapi got his money worth.
Dude gets rewarded for coming in 4lbs over? This is pathetic. If anything, give his share to Rakhmonov. He took the fight despite the other guy breaking the rules, AND he beat him! You shouldn't be able to fail and get paid for it.
I like humble jon
Got chills watching the love for Jon in his walkout. Fool me once & however that saying goes I'm just so happy for you champ & I have confidence in you're recovery. Goat!!
Style Bender wouldn’t last a round vs Jones 😭🤌🏽
Valentina is phenomenal fighter but she deserved to lose, she was fight too safely, Graso was more agressive and looking for serious attacks all the time
Jon jones: "Thank Jesus Christ for my test results equivalent of a small child"
Why does Captain Obvious always get the first question?
Crazy sport, guy has little muscle tone but I've said it a million times before,its not a body building championship. What a scary finish,shades of Jon vs  Lyoto. He can take a good punch which is good because from here on up its going to get tougher.
1:56:10 Cryyyyyyyying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 "All that muscle, wit a big ass pussy."😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
When do we get the USADA test results 🤣
They were gonna pay Francis all that money and feed him to the real predator. He got up out of there quickly. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Daniel Cormier beat stipe and jones has beat Cormier three times not counting he's bitch ass cheating with PEDs why is this a competitive fight?
Stipe looked shook when Jon started to call him out
Woman beater drunk driver ped abuser and the 🐐 LMFAO 🤡
please jon dont drink to celebrate, we need to see you at least 2 more fights please!!!!
Greatest heavyweight ever after one fight in the division....
grasso is just so dang cute.
Give 75k away now~~~ inflation Dana
Can you near the end of the interview that Jon was entering party Jon mode 😂
I’m worried about Jon’s wife
It's so obvious that everything Jon says is scripted. However, you get to see the REAL Jon when he spoke about Francis.
John made MMA history tonight
Never forget... Reyes beat Jones
Jon answers his soft body look,he looked great fron the bits we did see Great win 👌
We need a different Kazakh translator
Gane was/is too caught up on the game of being a French celebrity and having ranked matches on FIFA rather than you know.. train for his job. Nice job.
Grasso is a little Mexican warrior The Mexicans are Coming!
Amanda nunes is Brazilian you fuck who said she was Mexican
I love Gane , hope he holds the belt one day. Not while the goat Jon is fighting though lol. Its about to get shaky up top with sergei too.
I really hope jon has forgiven luke thomas and takes an interview with him
These are the dumbest Journalists in any sport I swear. Its like they let random people walk in from off the vegas strip
he solodified himself. no questions after
Malhadinho will shake you kkkkkkk
Malhadinho ainda vai lhe sacudir kakakaka
Geoff Neal getting his bonus after missing weight by 4lbs is pathetic. doesn’t set a good example
Jones makes divisions shallow
Jones is the full package, the absolute best to ever to do it and also super entertaining. The reason I started watching UFC🐐
Dana listen ..your smart... MMA is a ART...power slap is handy Craft...it will never reach a museum...it's primitive and in no comparison... everything you touch turns into gold...but this venture won't...sorry to break your bubble
1:42:44 🐐 alert!
Poor gane, true competitor ~~ he will be back
29-0  15 title fights
This is BS. Jones didn't fight his way up and sustain damage in the heavyweight division to become #1 contender. Gane fought Francis, Tai...etc to get where he was. Jones was gifted this fight with an advantage.
jones should change his name to "jon goats" ;)
I tried to tell people JJ would dominate man, I got called delusional, a meatrider, all kinds of things. Now it’s radio silence 😂
Bet DC hurting inside

Lol I feel like jones waited for Nganno to leave so he can have an ez match and claim the best heavy weight. Ngannu fixed that with his message to jones. He signed it with "Heavy Weight King". lmao
All Jon's haters saying for years ahh he's never going to heavyweight. Dude just wanted to get old to give them a chance. GOAT
Wait so tuff will air Friday? Dana white said you guys will see Friday….
When the Francis tweet came up, he got in the fightmode right away.. he was annoyed for the rest of the interview
Brought that Title Back To Merica!!!
Don't be too upset Gane. Your a French and you never had a chance against the American Steele
Bo got that weak ass bs win. Pickett is a good sport for taking the L like that and not complain
Jon boring ass Jones. Worse than watching paint dry.
I wish I could super like this
people need to develop their wrestling and they have a chance to become the best
It was honestly too easy for Jon guys. Think about it, he dominated. The only real damage he took was to his cock 😂
Cejudo called the exact sequence of the sub
my goodness Joan Jones turns into an ESG college professor
The new WWF. Beyond scripted
Seriously, I hope JJ lays off the ❄️ and leans into his greatness
精彩的比赛。🙏
Dana as a promoter obviously shits on Francis as he’s bitter, had Francis come to a deal with the ufc Dan would talk highly of him, that’s how a promoter works
Jon Jones is not the Goat! or maybe the Goat of Ped's
Of course he sees things as good for the show as it’s not spontaneous as Anthony Smith said he got told to do a scene again on TUF that’s not realist that’s contrived
Every fighter went out there and give it all & they all had something good to say in this post press. I love it, this is what its about honestly true true warriors all of them
j'aurai aime voir plus de combat debout, peut être un autre combat, peut être une autre issue!
Dana has created something real good here i’m grateful for the ufc boxing could never compete in my eyes
Hey Jones: 7uc4 you and your saviour! Your not humble at all.
The BO SHOW IS HERE 🇺🇸 💪🏻 🇺🇸
GANE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Alexa Grasso is so beautiful & so smart by being able to speak 3 languages. Wow!!
Gane is still a better human being than Jones
Zzz
Imagine Gane saying it is his first REAL loss is crazy to think it happened in just a snap compared to Francis. Real recognized real. I really do hope all the best to Gane, he seem like a genuinely nice guy.
I’m surprised how nervous Jones was. Fighting is one thing, but talking to press is a whole different beast.
Jones breaks the curse of drake with jesus allmighty😁💯
2 minute fight ....too bad
Ian Garry has potential to be GOAT.
How long ago did Jon get back with his Fiancé?
Jon Jones Bringing that wife beater energy
I feel happy for Jones but really sad for Ciryl
Shavkat vs Wonderboy!
All hail the heavyweight goat
How come Alexa's English is perfect?!?
Three african champs fell but three Mexican champs rose🇲🇽
Ciryl gane keeping it real i love that but jonny bones is truly ELITE
"I dont think there's any level higher than jon jones" - Dana  Well, he IS in Vegas so I guess we'll see just how high he goes!
Cyril sounds like he's just happy to be there like he's a fan or something and not a UFC fighter. Jon was right, he doesn't have that dog in him AND he's a sloppy fighter, like he's just throwing strikes with no real direction. I feel Stipe will give him more of a fight but Stipe been knocked out before and that ALWAYS will weaken a fighters chin. I feel Jon might knock out Stipe. Stipe isn't a 'fast' fighter and Jon might piece him up from the outside. So who's left...no one really. Everyone else are wresters and Jon is the best out of all of them. I just feeel Jon Jones will have an easier time cleaning out the heavyweight division because of the lack of top fighters. It's like 90% of the heavyweight fighters are average to shitty versus LHW fighters who Jon fought. I just see a long time as champ at HW.
Dana deep down thinking about men taking turns slapping each other
Cyril is my new favorite fighter. He got to kick Jon Jones in the nuts :D
Whether people like it or not John just gonna get a rested tonight
ciryl nice guy man
Izzy izzy izzy from southern Alberta
The nutshot by Nickal decided the fight. It was BEYOND obvious to everyone, but the ref ignored it, Rogan & co ignored it....UFC is so corrupt sometimes.
I’ve got a feeling John’s gonna be trouble tonight I hope not but I could just see something  in he’s eyes and his stare
"......is going to keep me humble. What's that? FRANCIS IS A BIG ASS PUSSY!"  "I can do all things through his name, amen." Goats are strange AF. SMH
Dana White's hands concern me. I see cancer. FUCK
9:50 Lesson = Learn ground work and escapes.
cereal can only be disappointed with that performance, looked like a novice bum on the ground.......😒
@2:43 “2 minutes? Get yo ass up outta here!” 😂
I’m gonna keep quoting Mexican Martial Arts: “Jon Jones got that SUPER high fight IQ. That fool leaves his IQ in the cage so he doesn’t lose it.”
y'a pas cocorico, y'a que John Bones Jones!! Et les journaleux français calmez-vous avec vos sorry etc vous faites pitié. Comme avec Ngannou et vos pleurnichardes car il remercie pas la France alors qu'il est camerounais...Vous en manquez pas une pour rappeler à quel point vous êtes pathétiques et mesquins!
pico jones got a win.
This was Jones vs Mbappe
That was the most pathetic performance i've seen since i started watching the UFC 2004. Gane just gave him his back without resistance. Tapped under 2 seconds. Pathethic. I guess what they say about the french is true.
Loves Gane rejecting the excuses the media was trying to make for him, he said he trained and prepared well it wouldn’t make a difference
The true champ not some sissy who always try’s to choke people out quick and end it “Khabib” 😅😅😅
Did Dana's ear get bigger or am I tripping
I've been saying for years...Jon Jones is the 🐐. So for all the stupid idiots out there that somehow think that Khabib is the 🐐...now you can kiss my ass and shut your mouth!!! There is absolutely no question who the goat really is!!!
Please don’t mention drake the Illuminati puppet. He’s a owl worshipper
Simple fact is that access to large amounts of money shows the reality of a person's true self. When money is no longer a boundary and you can do what you want, what you want bleeds through. JJ is a loser, a hood rat POS who makes very poor choices, he's a cheater in his sport and unfaithful to his oaths and is violent to those who can't defend themselves; he should have long since been ejected from MMA. As while supremely talented indeed, he is of extremely poor character and in no way a true and respectful martial artist.   That's my opinion anyway. It's sad what society excuses these days just because someone is good at something. While it certainly won't, it really should stop. Even the US government chose to rescue a drug addict loser over a US Marine who served his country and was a hero because of optics. Bash me in the comments if you like, you're only proving my point if you do. But I believe strong character is important for every man who's an actual man and especially for someone who's a pedestalized hero. We should all expect more and do better.
Francis is a big old 💩🐷 he would not last in the ring with j jones. All he has is a right hand. Jones has everything
Cyril Gane: IT'S ABOUT THE FIGHTING SPIRIT!! Being hungry, not frozen. Jones made it easy because of Gane's absence.
Did dirks not get a performance bonus ???
Let Jon celebrate with some coke, he has earned it
"To the little Mexican girls..." LMAO why does he make that sound so bad
I don't know what part of ciryls head thought he had a chance after getting ragdolled by francis grappling. Now, take a guy who is just as strong, just as dangerous, and add 15 years of elite wrestling. The poor guy never had a chance. Stipe will be a closer fight, but he will still fall short. That will set up DC vs. Jones 3 at heavyweight.
Nikal won the fight by kicking his opponent RIGHT in the sack. Wow. Peterson and the whole UFC really IS a foul organization.
NO YOUR STILL FAKE JONES
John🐐🕊🇮🇳🇺🇸
Ngannou would kill Jon
Stipe fight is so weak.. hes old. Why even make that fight. Go to LHW and hold 2 belts like DC did.
Acknowledge JC, he is the only true saviour
The champ is here 🪘
Now dc will forever be in jones shadow
Who is this Jesus fella jon keeps mentioning every time he talks to someone? Does he mow yards?
Godspeed 🙏🏽
Jon couldn't even get through his first postfight presser in three years without contradicting himself.....one moment he's talking about giving glory to God and remaining humble & grounded......then the next he's calling Nganno a pussy. Yup, Jon's a changed man alright.🙄
Thanks to Jon for saying it out loud. Francis is a Big Ol Pussy💯
Khabib is still the GOAT and Jones loses to Ngannou
PICTOGRAMMMMM
Ngannou 👑
Man's just casually called Ciryl fuckin Gane a cow😂😂
This was a prelim fight for Jon tonight....  The real fight is after...in his hotel....   With his Wife
Ciryl Gane sucks, he needs to go into slap fighting or tennis. How do you lose the chance to win the HW belt twice... against the the same game plan you just lost to.. I never want to hear anything from this guy again. I don't even care for Gane I just wanted him to beat that fraud Jones.
He is Back 🔥🔥
ALEXA GRASSO IS THE CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!
We all got kicked in the balls by Ciryl Gane
I'm french and I'll be honest: France is 30 years behind when it comes to MMA. Fucking politicians being so soft about the subject and not allowing french fighters to get to the level of other countries in this sport. It's really not Gane's fault. He needs to change a coach ASAP like Francis did ! Nobody knows Fernand Lopez and this guy has been riding on Ngannou's hype for so many years ! It's like having PSG of early Qatari days, facing Prime Real Madrid of Cristiano Ronaldo ! Gane needs a top tier wrestling coach and a olympic level wrestling training partner ! At 32 with 2 championship losses, It's time for him to get these high level experts otherwise, he will never become a complete fighter and Jon Jones said it best during the press conference. Gane can be dangerous and he doesn't need to do trash talking and do mind games to get an advantage, I mean look at GSP FFS ! Another thing that Gane admitted: HE IS LAZY ! he needs to change that to become a champion  because he is super talented but that talent is going to waste and that pisses me off !
Next Question! We lift you up Jon.
Better Man, Better Fighter, Better Father, Better Friend. Amene🙏🏾
I hope grasso keep the title for a long time the way she fought that 4th round without loosing a breath she is a breath of fresh air the division need and hope we see a rivalry between her and blanchfield
Praise Jesus! Congrats Jon!
Whatever you put in front of Bones, he wins!  There can be no more debate!
Dana so salty about francis leaving
Shavkats the truth. He would run through Chimaev and kill the hype
I’m sorry I disagree with DC stipe a harder fight then Ciryl gane😂😂😂 no way yeah stipe a legend for sure one of the best but he’s old past his prime after Francis knocked him out that was the end of stipe DC beat him if DC can beat him Jones will do the same as he did Gane made him tap easily Jones is the 🐐 for a reason smarter then eveyone to me Gane is younger fresher then stipe who is 40 older then his prime days gane is the best heavyweight jones could face Gane beats stipe and anyone else jones is gonna walk past the heavy weight division easily
Stipe will be the actual challenge for Jones. I do think Jon is the GOAT, but I don’t think he’s had his _real_ test at heavyweight yet.
Even though I was rooting for Bones, I feel bad for Gane. Nice guy.
Wat is p4p ranking
Why did Jon curve the Drake Curse question so hard? Any story behind that at all?
rematch in a year or two. let bones stomp some other heavyweights and give gane some more time/notice for training <3 both top athletes, jons the goat. but let em run it back sometime he'll keep on his feet better 😁
Alexa! What a champ!! She speaks three languages!!! Amazing!!
We need nganouuuu and jones
Very magnifique
New mythical fighter   Jon “Chandler Quotes” Jones
Bo Nickal secured takedown after hitting Pickett with a massive knee to the groin. It was very clear from the angle it was shot in and you can see Pickett's immediate reaction. I think that's why they didn't show the replay after his interview. He also looked like he knew it happened. Someone must've seen it.
1:24:48 not sorry no mercy merci that was a dope line
is this the longest post fight press conference ever . also jon jones is the goat
jon jones is the goat
2:02:13 My man talking about illegal blows.
If Jones was White, he would be the highest paid fighter on the Planet.
Jon proclaiming his Christian faith then calling Francis a 'pussy'. Nice way showing your faith Bones. Makes one wonder.
Highest PPV Heavyweight fight ever,  remember that next time the UFC tries to push White Hypes like McGregor who hasn't earned it.   Here's a fact Whites racist will try to deny, the UFC over pays White fighters because they know White Supremacy can't thrive without white people have more money
Gane totally won. Bullshit decision.
Jon knew the fight was gonna be short so he made his entrance take ages
Boring  Dana really ruin ufc an scared away another great fighters  I have too say ufc heavyweight division weakest in any sport  MMA Boxing
Come to Germany
Watching history being made live after UFC 285, and the adrenaline we all have been feeling through our veins, its pretty tough going back to your boring daily 9-5 job, being totally numb each and every day. May god give us his blessing and make our dreams come true and manifest our thoughts, and feel alive every day.   Congrats Bones 🙏
Craisy that Danan White knew Jones wouldl be back anfd on pupose made so Francis Ngano got out of UFC, he would absolutley KILL Danas femboy
Jones has beaten 3-4 generations of Title contenders! Holy shit!
Gane has all the skill but lacks the killer instinct..dangerous man if he ever taps into it
Congrats to Grasso, but she's going to have to do it again. Pena upset Nunes and Nunes showed it was a fluke. I have a feeling the same will happen with Shevchenko. I'll be placing a large bet on her to finish Grasso in the rematch.
Stay clean GOAT
MEXICO!..MEXICO!!.. MEXICOOOO!!!!!!
The performance of the night should’ve been Jake Gyllenhaal’s Flying Knee KO
Bro Jon is a crazy man not even joking like he really crazy and has mixed personalities he the MMA God tho
They really need to quit letting these idiots wear the stupid hats wtf I'm an eagle no I'm  wearing half a wolf on my head
Islam and v Volk can stop crying about who #1 is now 😂
Ciryl should find new coach
Had a multi. Jon came through, 18 other legs came through. Lost 1 over 2.5 goals. They had 2 goals before half time. 20cents to 14k. Anyway fuck yeah Jon!!!!
Jon telling Stipe to take time off fire fighting is cold af 😂
GOAT... No bones about it.
Dana White VS Joe Rogan  who wins?
Who else is going to check the mma news first thing in the morning to see if Jones was arrested or not
“ I happen to like the product” we’re living in a weird time.
Had to ho to ground😴excited to see new jones...oh same just more of a pudding
I'm new to this whole UFC thing, but seriously? Someone in Ciryl's corner should have warned him to NOT kick Jon in the nuts. That's just asking for trouble. Rookie error.
I love how Jones says he's a really big Christian and how he's wants to stay humble then calls Francis Ngannou a big-ol-pussy lol. @ 1:56:10
You never bet against Jones
The king is back baby!
bring in brock lesnar to pound the living F out of jon the criminal jones!
Great respect for Shavkat for speaking only Kazakh language!
I was in a sports Bar and when Jon took him down the place went crazy......I thought that was strange.....Fans are changing
Jon Jones the GOAT. Think of the resume... Khabib is not even close
JJ is a cheater and hits women. How he even gets these chances over and over just speaks to money over values
All the whiney neckbeards on Reddit from the last 3 years that have been hating Jones and predicting he would get KO’d in his heavyweight debut are punching air right now. All those long detailed essays talking about how Jon was gonna accomplish nothing at heavyweight amounted to absolutely nothing. Sad times for those individuals. Enjoy the cope.
Bad day to be a bag of cocaine with heavyweight champ on the loose 👃
Newbies fans discover Bones the GOAT today. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bones is the GOAT, period...But he is severely mentally ill
Grasso mi herma,MI Reyna. Gracias.❤
Дана якось постарів🫤
Cyril is unfortunately in the new Jon Jones era like Cormier. Jon Jones is the best of all time!
He's definitely scary. They gave him a good starter opponent, I want to see how it goes with Blaydes, Aspinol or some of the big Russians.
Proud of Dana White for coming out of the closet during this press conference.
JBJ is absolutely incredible. <><
I love Dana, but I'm getting sick of hearing him say "Jon Jones is the GOAT, nobody can argue that" I agree he is probably the greatest "fighter" of all time. To be considered the GOAT though in my opinion. You cannot have the kind of blemishes that Jon has, the biggest being steroid usage....automatic DQ if you ask me. Anderson Silva is one of my favorite fighters ever but he also would not be included in the GOAT conversation for the same reason, again just my opinion.
Jones talking like tito
Respect... Jones
1:56:10 BEST MOMENT 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Jones still has to get out of las vegas without being arrested
Jon look clean asf 🔥
So many fans forgot the greatness and dominance of jon jones,you just can't bet against him in a fight.
Jones looking like an Union Army Officer lol
GOAT
If Ciryl wants to reach his full potential he needs to go to a new gym
GOD ABOVE ALL ✝️✝️
"47,46,45,43,44,43...  My daughter has dyslexia"
I don’t care that Valentina lost I would still give her a baby ❤
The GOAT bones 🐐🐐 Beat the Drake Curse, UFC Embedded Haircut Curse, Chael Curse all in one night.  All he gotta do now is beat the Las Vegas arrest curse
Big respect to Jon Jones, he is the GOAT. But I worry a little when he thanks Jesus Christ.
🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿
This year 2 GOAT debate ended. Football/Soccer ~ Messi MMA ~ Jones  What a fokin start of 20202023
Jon's wife gave him a harder fight than cereal gane
Imagine doing whatever the FUCK you want to do  All the drugs. Cheating. Drink and drive. All the times he's not caught. Barely fights.  Walks in and just becomes heavyweight champ in 2 minutes
the perfect response to Francis bullshit comment 😂
Technically france got the belt when Francis had it
Dana hanging from Jon's scrotum for dear life
GANE WHO? THE FRENCHMAN  SHOULD STICK TO SOCCER  INSTEAD. JONES LOOKS LIKE A KILLER IN A DIVISION VOID OF QUALITY FIGHTERS.
JON JONES IS THE GOAT 🐐🦴
Where all the casual Ciryl fanboys at now?? 😂 Jonny Bones ftw!!
Lol Jones shaded Drake he said “next question” when they asked him about beating the drake curse and winning drake money on a bet
No hand fighting, nothing. Gane bank account about look like Jon Jones stomach.
Tfw Jones wife lasted longer than gane…
That was too easy for Jon, but he’s not done yet…. his REAL test is going to be tonight’s after-party
Jon winning the title and Shevchenko losing, It was a wild night
Whether people like it or not, Jon is the GOAT
People calling this rigged has to be the biggest cope ever
The goat the debate is over
Too easy!
Jake paul knocks out Jon jones
Turn to Yahuah while you still can❤️
