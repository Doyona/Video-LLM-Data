'I could have gone pro but I wasn't good enough' is so funny to me for some reason 😂
That was amazing Ameziane. One thing about you is your resilience and relentlessness when learning new things. Hat off for that.

at the start Kenzie clearly knew a lot more about pottery and was just trying to help
build something from ikea WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS
Soooo engaging. I love your energy. You are so kind to others
Pottery wheel throwing is one of the hardest things I ever learned, and you doing it with that tiny wheel… another level of struggle
The "Oh ClaY ThErE" had me 🤣🤣🤣
Your hair makes you look like some Shakespeare looking poet loving old guy tbh
I really love the videos and the dynamic between you and Faisal reminds me of me and my sister. It’s sooooo relatabley funny so kanallah always do videos with Faisal

@ameziane what breed is your cat? i need to knoww, does anyone know??

Challenge: actually commit to practicing pottery and show us the results in let’s say 500 hours of actual practice :) (in other words: 2 hours per day over the span of 250 days(within a year)). Make your best vase! ;)
Loved the video, just me in my bed laughing was the best vibe😂 can't wait for next video😊 you should try making those animal shapes from long balloons, that would be so funny, 👍
I feel like this guy can just practice 5 minutes and manages to success at anything 😂 Inspiring as always !
