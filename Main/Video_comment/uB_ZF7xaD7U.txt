Eubank jr was right. We only saw 60%
Dang and I mean they promoted the heck out of this fight wow
I can't see Ben knowingly taking  Juice before the biggest fight of his life, it is standard that they will have tested both considering what was on the line.  If Connor Ben did knowingly juice up then maybe he should retire because hes had too many knocks to the head.
no.1 BS!
Through insurance purposes
I hope all the undercards was paid money due and on present
Look at his neck haha sted head
Conor benn is a let down..
All these athletes cheat, only very few are honest
Bruh
BRUH SMH
Both camps new weeks ago about the failed PED test, probably why Eubanks Snr didn't want his son fighting. Shame on Eddie and the Benn camp.
Conor still ivf champion
Eubank jr would have Benn Jr beaten if this fight went ahead,Eubank is a cool character  whereas Benn Jr seemed more hyped up,even Benn senior was more chilled,someone's comment said a while back that Benn Jr show signs of roid rage.
Someone tell Conman its the IBF not IVF
Chris Eubank was right about ben when he said he needs to worry not about boxing but the outside life style of it.
No wonder..... He was confident
C.Benn (clomid benn)
Eubank showd class
Eubank beat him withhis class
Hearn nearly pulled off a proper sly one there 🙈🤣
THIS IS NOT GOOD
Benn trying to get pregnant? 😂😂
🤣😂🤦
Fertility drug?   Testosterone then?
Conor is very good. But I would of wanted Chris to win.
Shocked he's a ped user! Btw This fight won't ever happen, so dnt get your hope's up.
Imagine the fight goes ahead and Benn still looses.... 60% Meme will become cemented in history .
Meesssyyy🤪🤣👊🏾👊🏾💥
The undercard should be aloud to go on with the main support up graded to top of the bill,it's not fair because they won't get paid.
The test was voluntary....
Boxing completely sucks, only was going to watch because of their dads.  I'll stick with ufc atleast when fights are off always a replacement.
BBBoC are a disgrace. A failed drug test and they did not cancel the fight.  it took a news paper to reveal the failed test.
What is the drug anyone know ?
This joke off a fight should never off been set in the first place I'm just laughing my ass off because all those mugs who have paid for it booked hotels and etc lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 unlucky
joke mate joke hes a joke thats all i can say
Eddie Hearn has known about this for weeks. Now I think its time that the promotion was held accountable for wanting to let this happen in these circumstances. If the fighter gets reprimanded then so should his boss.
Ban him for life
Bought cars to early
There goes my winning bet.
So many fans disappointed. They knew two weeks ago a trace was found. How can you clear your name after this. Was a huge fan of Conor until now.. Should be banned..
Right,  Gutted but I believe Connor is a cheat. Why else would you have clomifene which treats infertility in women who do not ovulate, including those with polycystic ovary syndrome. Furthermore In males, clomiphene citrate increases levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones are important for fertility and are present in both males and females. LH encourages the release of testosterone in males.  So with the science fact above its crystal clear that Connor is doping. What plausible reaon could he have for this drug to be present in his system.  I agree with banning cheats totally. Connor had let himself down, his father as especially fans.
Matchroom  what a bunch of jokers.
I guess he needed help to handle Eubank's 60%
How many times have boxers been told they are responsible for everything that goes into their bodies. Hearn would have Grainnes fighting if he could earn a pound note.
Benn looks like he does abit of charlie with his mrs
Conor as let the British public down And he’s not example to the Young kids looking up to him for This should be stripped of all the sponsors and brand from  Boxing It’s a disgrace
Little Benn srank his little ding dong 💉
Connor fumbled the bag big time
What a fiasco all the hard work from undercard boxers for nothing all down to one man hes blown it now
A 60% Eubank was to much for Benn.
He’s father loved a edge just look at the Gerald bout Nigel was on the gas
Benn was juicing???!!! I know his father is ashamed of him!! The black destroyer was the real deal!!!
It's unfortunate that Benn used clomifine because I was looking forward to watching this fight. Feel bad for Eubank and all the undercard fighters that won't get to fight and so won't get paid.
He should be banned for life, as should anyone in any professional sport that fails a drugs test.
Connor Ben had just sunk like a titanic !!!!
They should of took a leaf out the UFC and had a step in opponent absolute crabsticks
I’ll forgive Conor if he fights Vergil Ortiz instead
They knew weeks  ago about blood test😄
Thats disapointing !!
Had the weekend to themselves and they fumbled the bag completely! Good job guys
Benn's lot should be paying the undercard 🥊
I knew it would be  So not safe to go on
Maybe it’s for the best. Eubank is a middleweight and Benn a natural welterweight. Jr is 31 and should be pushing for a world title fight, not publicity stunts like this. His promising career will fizzle out unless he can secure bouts against top 10 ranked opponents, win them and earn a shot at a world champion.
It was just the A sample he said 😂😂 samples a sample mate
Benn has bent my weekend!!! Cheers mate 😭
It may very well not have been Conner's fault, he probably has a supplement/dietitian who would've been managing his consumption.
DRUG CHEAT!!!!!!!!
The bookies should add failed drug test to the betting options.
Benn will bounce back from this, I’m in your corner lil bruh,  keep grinding till your hand is raised in victory with all the belts.
He's a disgrace
I've just Google clomiphene wow I'm disappointed
There was me jumping on the benn bandwagon my bad what a let  down
If you can’t do it naturally then you’re a bum. Stop taking fights if you can’t stay clean. You’re wasting people’s time come on benn
worse than an L
Chris needs to refocus and fight GGG. As for Benn he's finished.
It's a small substance in a drink for energy
Love to be a fly on the wall, when Eubanks snr phones Benn snr 🫣
Benn let Eubank Jr down, as well as himself and the fans. Eubank Jr should stay well clear in future and pursue a world title at 160lbs.
That’s a lie, ben is clean, it’s all politics, don’t believe the media
This is the first time that Eddie has done real damage to his own and the Matchroom brand.  If you fail a voluntary test then you have been caught, regardless of whether the BBBoC recognise them (which they should).  Why go after the BBBoC, let it go. You are better off going to the fighter if you want recourse! A massive shame.
Ol hell naw i want my money back 🤣🤣
Chris snr didn't want Jr to fight because he new about this. Chris Jr agrees anyway and the fix was on. Chris snr wants nothing to do with the fight daily mail leaks the news and the fix is off lol
At least Eubanks test came back positive for KFC 😂😂😂😂
RIP to whatever mundane career Benn was gonna have
If Sky had the PPV rights instead of DAZN it would still be going ahead 🤑🤑🤑
Everybody is going on like performance enhancing substances haven't been used in boxing b4, what about Tyson Fury boar story & he's just a HW World champ🤔
Ok …. So Benn is the bad guy for now until he fights again providing he wins .  Remember all publicity is good publicity
They way Connor Benn is constantly out here giving Kayne Face, I am not surprised he’s on something. He always act like he has a very painful stick up his hole. He’s my least favourite fighter at the moment
Lame. Good job Conor Benn!
Hmm
Is anyone surprised this fight isn't taking place? It's boxing.
I knew something was not right when he knocked out algieri when no one from his illustrious former world champs could do that to him, not with a single punch, even after an accumulation of punches he's not been not been knocked out that brutally. Conor should be banned for life.
I thought it was still going forward?
Benn maybe not suspended atm but he definitely should be, matchroom should be suspended to for the disgraceful role they have played since finding out also!
This explains why eubank jr has been posting videos of himself stuffing his face for weeks. He knew in August that this fight wouldn't happen🤦‍♂️
Old seeninger play of
Feel for eubank and the undercard + fans who's paid for tickets hotel's etc etc  Benn needs to come out in person and tell the truth and accept he's tried to cheat or why run the risk of taking it in the 1st place
Jr would batter him and he knows it thas why he tried to cheat let everyone done
You lot for goodness sake Its was a fertility drug he had FERTILITY common sense maybe he has issues with having kids  who knows only god  thing . no curruption here...  involved.
Why do they do this juicing nonsense, surely they know they will get caught, its such a shame for the undercard who are paid appetence in comparison who are the true warriors of the sport.
All the money lost and time away from families. Undercard fighters must be fuming with Benn.
Should go down as a loss on his record. The whole thing was a circus anyway.
He is a drugs cheat!
Should be banned for 12 months.
Conor Benn should be ban.
It's the right decision, this fight should never have been considered in the first place. Saved Benn getting thrashed.
Glad it's off, now keep it off, ridiculous match anyway
Both way to effeminate to be a bad man
If 2 fighters want go ahead and 1 doesn't think other holds advantage by taken the substance then fight should have went  ahead .
Truly gutted over this...sorry for all concerned...if conor is guilty off this...its a sad day....but I'm hoping with all my heart he is innocent....its happened to fury Dylan white...both counts innocent Hope same applies
Bro wtf Smh
Conor Benn Tren
Eddie Hearn should be ashamed of himself, Benn is taking all sorts and this drug was to disguise the other drugs he was taking, he should be banned for life
this should be a list on con-nors record. what a shame!
All the hype of moving up two weight classes the back story with the father's just proves Benn's not Ready
Very strange
No b sample yet? 🤣🤣🤣 it’s not hard to get the b sample checked. So he’s taken it and a drugs cheat 🙏
Sigh smh
That's it now this fight will never happen
Poor Chris eubank dropping weight now you can eat loads of kfc
Of Course it is off, The Bookies knew Benn would Lose the fight as did Benn and Company, He Did not even want to start the fight. Chris Eubank Jr was the bigger man with the longer reach, Chris Eubank Jr Fought on the big stage and had the top class Experience with class fighters. who really thought Benn would win this fight, His father was a flat footed boxer who was over hyped and when he met a fighter with a hard chin got bashed up. Fought Five top class fighters in his career of 42 fights. Benn would have been beaten within six rounds.
Fury v Joshua , now this no wonder why boxing is on the decline 👎👎👎
Some facts. When this drug is in your system, you've taken it. 100%. Keys not keep saying ' we think it's a mistake' no! He's taken it and he needs to admit it. Shame, as I thought he didn't seem the type.
Shame. Very sad moment for all. Benn included. Was looking forward to the fight.
DAZN IS A JOKE
Mr Benn… would you like a sweetie?  ~ C. Eubank Snr
The drugs don’t work. Game over Conor, reputation in tatters. 👎
Dammit i never got to see that 60% 😆 🤣 😂
Its officially just been announced aswell that he has failed a lie detector test and he isnt human
Boxing is a joke now
OoOoOoh NoOoOo 😂  I imagine  isn’t prepared for Chris just yet  Risky, avoid the fight at all costs... Shame, at least Chris can see some lady again for abit🙃🙂😉🙂🙃
His head screams juicer, look at the shape and size of it.
They are all on PEDs it's a open secret in all professional sports but especially combat sports. Sometimes they get caught being complacent and taking the wrong thing at the wrong time. They all have coaches and access to doctors and dodgy pharmacists who know how to beat the test and get around tests. They come out with new drugs every year that fly under the radar. It's been like this for decades. Only narcissists and sociopaths reach the top of professional sports now who are of the mentally "If you ain't cheating you ain't trying" or "I would have been the best regardless of the drugs" There is no honour in sports anymore. How do you think they train the way they do without their bodies totally breaking down? You can't you'd get injured and would become ill from bashing your central nervous system and immune system so hard day in day out for hours and hour a day.
They knew this a few weeks ago and that’s why Snr said pull it. They have only confronted it now after the media broke the story 🤷🏻‍♂️
Boxing's on the ropes.
Conner Ben what a joke - his a dope
Conor Benn is a disgrace for cheating he should be banned from fighting …
Boxing stinks ...
Benn needs serious punishment. He's wasted every one's time and money.
in general this fight never should have happened in the first place
What a let down
GIVING US HOPE AT THE END  LOL
This is the end of benn
Hopefully Chris still gets paid
I was and I state was a supporter of the Benn family, but never again. Shameful.
Refund everyone !!!!
They knew what they were doing, scrap all the clean cut stuff been caught out don't play the martyr's. Bye bye rep
I worship the Ben name from a kid today is a black day. Chris is what he is but he has won a major follow now. I pray he is clean
It cant happen,what a massive SHAME,,,Big week end gone,,,
Hugely disappointed that benn would take clomid. No other reason to take that or other than to stimulate the testes to produce testosterone after exogenous test being administered...in layman terms, this is blatant cheating and doing so with the Xtra strength could have created nasty outcome for Chris who would be significantly weaker than normal. Benn, you have let millions of people down. None more than yourself.
Another one up for the Eubanks
Shame, I was looking forward too a good ruck.
Was so looking forward to this fight... but this is the right and really only thing to do. It's not right for all the undercard though as their likely left with nothing.... Well done Benn.
Why is there not a process In place when something like this happens? Did he cheat or did he not?
Not being funny here but this Eubank Jr vs Corner Benn fight was never ever gonna live up to what there dad's did when they fort in the early 90s I think there's a bit of Take That going here meaning relight my fire lol😆😂🤣they'll always be living in the shadows of there dad's it's just the way it is & always will be there dad's rivalry is & was Legendary the dad's brought the country to a stand still to an extent when they fort this has just been like being at the circus regarding the kids fight
He had to get the edge because Eubanks is a destroyer
Snr spiked Benn's water so Jr doesn't have to fight
Hearn known this months ago. Snake melt whelk
You’ve gave Eubanks fuel to the fire now you’re own fault lesson learned too late
Conor Benn really messed up with his cheating ways.
Did he eat some of Canelo's Mexican meat? Did Canelo make him some steaks?
Im sure its still on
Right choice, eubank could had possibly been hurt with this huge advantage of power and stamina against someone who would had been dehydrated despite him being the naturally bigger guy.
That’s finally the correct decision. You fail a drugs test you are out. This is the fight business ppl get hurt and can loose their lives. No drugs cheat should be sanctioned to fight. Benn let everyone down at the end of the day
Imagine getting in trouble for something that probably every athlete does
Whata plonka
Eddie will blame it on the water
The test saved Benn from annihilation
The whole thing stinks, there needs to be a government lead  independent enquiry, into the Promoters, with the drug testing teams...I bet it unearths a massive can of worms
No B sample lol pattern going on here with matchroom
Well Connor has well and truly cemented his dad's legacy well done
Benn should go to jail he was on roids when he k.o algeri what a cheater
Was it a mask or a mistake? At that level logically it was a mask.
Feel sorry for any people who brought tickets or hotel accommodation for the fight.
Eubank Snr knows best he's a good father
I think Jake Paul should step up
Half the fighters out there are on the juice , they just have smarter men with the needles who can time it in the system better so it doesn't show up
Probably be some court claims from fans that have forked out for hotels and travel expenses.
Disgrace, been is not telling the truth about how that drug got in his system. Boxing has really lost its way. Eddie hearn and the other promoters do nothing but creat theatre and scam fans
It's a way out because he's not ready. Needs more experience. ( I have no idea about either fighter, by the way. Just thought it sounds good ).
Chris Eubanks had insight well spotted Chris take me hat off to you
Good
how can they look for a legal avenue to continue the fight if a substance is banned..? i mean wtf...makes no flipping sense. either your banned for doing drugs or not. period
NOT GOOD FOR BOXING
Goodnight to Benn's hope of any respect
I want to know why they sign up for a voluntary testing scheme when they are already been tested by the boxing board of control why do they need to be tested by two different Testing company
I feel sorry for all the fans who have booked up travel and hotels (non refundable) all because of Benn. They are the people who have been left seriously out of pocket. Nigel must be really proud of him.
Was really looking forward to this fight...what was the drug benn had taken
Looking forward for the flight Saturday. Same as fury and aj. Boxing is turning into a joke. Back to ufc it is then..
What a shambles benn Absolute Embarrassment to the sport
It only got called off because it got leaked. Disgraceful from both camps and promoters. No wonder Eubank Snr didn't want anything to do with it.
Benn the cheat should get his license revoked.
Deadzn really taking a beating atm
i knew this fight was not gonna happen to begin with.
They havin knowin about this for a few weeks and now call it of in the last minute... shocking stuff hi
Cancel the whole fight dont let them fight each other now, after everyone has been talking about this and to let them down like this, no one cares now no one wants to see this anymore you have completely ruined it.
Everybody cheats. Blame the guy who got benn’s PED cycle wrong
Eubank snr saw it coming
So disappointing wow
Ben just ended his own career 😳   Boxing is a mess
Conor Ben ain’t took no drugs it’s rah bull
Look regardless of whether the failed drug test is flawed or not but it’s been two weeks now and it’s unbelievable that they haven’t given out result of B test so as much as I wanted to see the fight I believe the right decision to postpone is best but I do think Eddie Hearn has not been honest and he still wanted to overrule the bbboc WTF they may not be perfect but they have the boxers safety as their priority Whereas Hearn has money as his.
Good shouldn't be a fight between them anyway...
What a way to save CRIS’s CAREER LOL HE WAS ONE FIGHT FROM RETIREMENT
I can see a law suit from eubanks team
And Coner has a dietitian surely he would of know better taking a legal drug which is band ???
I backed benn the whole way. But now I’m totally on Eubanks side. Not because I like him but because Benn cheated and Eubank literally did not cheat! Eubanks still annoying, but honest!
I'll Chris. This I'm about 170 pounds. 2 amateur kick boxing fight under my belt. I'll smash Chris in 4
*60% Eubank Jr would still beat 160% Benn*
Connor is a joke lost all respect for him
This wasn't a fight it was a freak show!
So you guys called off a fight because he doesn't want to get pregnant? Lol it's not even a steroid
😄😊😅🤔😢😂😭😭😂😂😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😭😭
How’s the family Nigel
So what is this fertility drug, why is it banned, what does it do, so many questions.
Connor waste man, he new he didn’t have a chance without his drugs and Chris dad snitched told the bored
Tests where done about a month ago apparently, both camps tried to keep a lid on it 🧐
Good why have drug testing then if not enforcing it.
This is a setup for the next lineup. All fake
That's good I bet Eubank snr is happy that's the main thing in all this
Connor threw his dad's legacy down toilet Feel sorry for Nigel Wtf 🤬
I hope JR gets compensated for it.
Was looking forward to this ish kmt
Conor benn is the new IVF Champion 🏆
People buying hotels flights and other things there should be a way so people can sue them
Benn Benn Benn bottle went imo edit: how did I forget, the cheat!!
Matchroom are a disgrace.
now wait a darn minute   the promoters want to take legal action against the board of boxing for LETTING the fight go ahead.  isn't that backwards 🤣
This was news 2 days ago.. keep up SKY
Benn won't recover from this.
Not a great week for eddie   Did he find his pen yet
this will follow benn forever whatever he achieves,like cannello/whyte massive mistake saying never done anything that’s what ben johnstone said and dwain chambers,i know different sport but still cheating to gain advantage,never going to admit anything is he,that’s for his book in 20-30 yrs
Left Hook City Central  Just to give some info as a competitive bodybuilder - Clomid or clomiphene is taken after an anabolic steroid cycle to start the body producing its own testosterone again after being shut down by the exogenous hormones (steroids). He would not have been taking that alone to raise testosterone, rather, he most likely was using steroids or anabolic hormones/drugs during his camp and then took clomiphene afterwards to elevate his natural levels back to normal. It would seem they were worried about the size difference in this fight and they have been using anabolics to gain size/strength quickly. They have just got the clearance times wrong and some was still detectable in his system. (copied and pasted)
Ffs good job I didn't take that day off work like I was gona do
In this age you will never get a real fighter taking on another real fighter who weighs more. Not since Dempsey V the orchid man will  fighters ever be real again and actually fighters.
Benn let everyone down
What a "FARCE", would like to say it's  unbelievable but when eddie hearne is dealing with things it never is...
why did benn jeopardize the fight by taking an unprescribed drug!?. unless he was privately running scared of losing
If ROLLY ROMERO CAN PASS DRUG TEST AND BENN CANT HOUSTON WE HAVE A PROBLEM FIRE EVERYONE
Mad smh
A fertility drug is he trying to get pregnant?
Man was just trying have kids lol
Gutted!!!!!
*HOW TF DO YOU FAIL A DRUG TEST! WHY TF ARE THEY EVEN IN YOUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN YOU HAVE A FIGHT COMING UP…..*
Well no surprise there really
I knew this fight was never gonna happen...Im glad in a way boxing has gone to the dogs yard now with this YouTube b.s and everyone making their own fights is nonsense both of them would get there face smashed in their own division and only get less than half the money so that's all it was for is money really yeah the fan's wanna see them fight but the real recognition should go to the champions I there weight class not these pair of chattie patties
His dad must be proud 😤
Eubanks missus better put in a bloody good shift tonight
So conor Benn does not give a crap about his fans....!!.
Made the fans wait until the last week off the fight , promoted should be ashamed,  Connor Benn even more so, dont want to here about Connor no more or watch him fight,
I hope it goes ahead, payed big money
Connor Benn cheats. Sad.
Dan Lawrence, head of performance at match room has a lot to answer for in regards to his reasoning behind advising Benn to take the drug. I feel people would’ve had more respect for Benn if he couldn’t make the weight and got some what close. Oppose to the route he chose and was advised. Him and his team chose their bank accounts over their respect to the sport.
Everybody is on steroids    NATE DIAZ
Dammit!! I was looking forward to this first the Queen and now this 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ no disrespect to the Queen but I wanted all these fights to go on and I hope Conor Sparks 💥🥊 Eubank Jr cuz he always calling out smaller guys and don’t fight no one of note at 160lbs
Guys conor has never had a problem with tests before so instead of being  negative see the other possible reasons....one being set up by certain people not wanting jr to fight!!!
Major L for Benn 😂
Sur-prise, surprise. I, for one, am relieved it didnt go ahead, and of the opinion that the fight should not have been possible to matchmake in the first place.
On. Off. On.  Off will they refund my popcorn n pizza 🤔
Amen serves you right you let down
He got in to big Kalle's stash
Now we know what he was crushing in the gym
Connor "100% mate" Clomid Benn
Another boxing let down roll on ufc 280 which is never a let down
How utterly depressing.
Chris Eubank Snr has got something to do with this, he approached team mayweather over in the states who have strong connections with Nevada testing and they’ve altered the results. If sample B comes back all clear then trust me Eubank Snr has got something to do with this. All masterminded by Snr and team mayweather  This is my theory
David Benavides would have been ready.
Conor Benn needs to be banned from boxing
Man Benn was probably the most exciting boxers in the world and whatever has gone wrong here is terrible for Benn and his rep
Didn’t care 48hrs ago. Don’t care now.
Immediately after making the announcement, numerous witnesses  saw Eddie Hearn in the local branch of McDonald's. According to sources "he just wanted his god-damned breakfast..."
Connor Benns jab is that strong VADA picked it up
These M8s are all on something
Like the other 100 videos about the fight I thought from the start it wouldn’t happen
This is not good for boxing at all very disappointing. All the undercard loose their fights & purses with out a word for them . 12 week camps all down the drain . I would be suing for breach of contract & leaving matchroom
Was looking forward to this fight. Ffs 🤦‍♂️
Sanity prevails at last. This fight should never have been made in the first place. Always possible the B sample comes up clean, but common sense says VADA have caught him tapering of his PCT after getting a bit of pharmaceutical assistance bulking up...
Proper let down.
for me thats 1-0  to Eubank
So glad they made this decision.
Hope Conor is cleared of this, there are ways and means of reaching the pinnicle of your sport, hard work and dedication, not PEDS. If you have taken these knowingly then your Rep for me has gone.
This is the only instance where CE will always come before CB!
All the U.K fighters be cheating lol. Tyson fury cheated at least twice in the past too. Makes no sense.
All involved in drug taking and knowing that they are taking them want firing from boxing ashame on you .
Obviously the b sample disappeared then?
come clean and this does not happen! simple
Let everyone down conor especially yourself.
The B sample needs to be tested and let this play out through the courts I hope Conor Benn is happy that he just cost Eddie Hearn a lot of money Frank Warren is laughing now Eddie has not had much luck lately AJ fight is  off with Tyson and now this. And the ones I also feel sorry for is the undercards because of Conor Benn they now can't fight what an absolute disgrace
Sky trying to destroy matchroom before the b sample has landed. Wasserman (Eubanks reps) have already said they are sueing the Bbofbc over refusing the grant a license before appropriate tests are completed. Just more of the anti Eddie Hearn crew Piling on you’re all pathetic
Benn only jabs when his sleeves are pulled up
🤯
cheatet
what a joke boxing has come to, fights canelling and fights not being signed, starting to push my focus more over to mma now
Stupid little child. This is what happens when you give a kid too much money and opportunity 🤦🏽‍♂️
It's looking like Benn will be relieved to get out of the fight. I hate people who have to cheat!
A that money they have to give back it's really caused me to dislike Conner now biggest fight nearly aswell
Never thought I'd rate Chris eubank Jr more then Connor Benn. What a joke.
Just 2 days left wtf !!!
Best wishes to conor hope his pregnancy goes well.
My Saturday night ruined cheers bro 😒
Boxing is a panto , hopefully this will force them to reset the way they present boxing to the world !
God damnt. Boxing sucks this year
Imagine having such an opportunity and all you have to do is not take drugs, absolute flop
The new IVF champion Conner benn
I'm glad it's off not fair failing a drug test hopefully he dosnt get a ban and they can fight in December or sometime in January maybe connor benn didn't know all about this it could of been in some of t food he eat only god knows
Promoter's trying to push the blame lol. Nobody is to blame but Benn.
Benn the cheat , ban him for life , had this fight on perveiw  got the beers in havin mates round , booked the night off work , Thankyou Conner benn Thankyou very much 🤬
Gutted. Nice one Benn.
Kick him out of Boxing for life. Not even be allowed to train anyone
I guess we know now what Benn was CRUSHING IN THE GYM
What a joke boxing is becoming
Why female fertility drugs?  Why not male fertility drugs?
Conor Benn. Dilliain whyte are Drug cheats💊💉💊💉💊💉💊 We are still waiting for the B sample 😂😂😂 Eddie hearn match room boxing and Dazn are finished 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Respect to Eubank Sr for leaking the story to Daily Mail
Sky Sports choice of slow mo clip of Eubank dressed as Santa was legendary!
I feel sorry for Chris
Wow Benn is scared
If i was Nigel..... conor wouldnt be welcomed round mine this christmas.
The Benn camp should be held liable for paying the entire undercard, as well as refunding fans any expenses they might have already spent, such as hotel bills, and even days booked off work. Disgraceful behaviour.
Benn will always be remembered for this....shame.
The right decision. Benn should be reprimanded and heavily fined. I hope it can be rescheduled next year.
Was lookin forward to the fight 💨🚣
Drug cheating
Get Conor out of boxing I will never be a fan anymore
What does that say about ukad, vada obviously don't mess about
It won’t be the first time he has cheated
Look at Benn neck it huge. That not natural
Clownor Benn smh I was so excited for this fight you 🛎 end
Another big hit to DAZN
Benn knew he couldn't do it with out help
So it should. Hearn should be ashamed of trying to ignore the rules and have it go ahead
Boxing has become a joke recently.
I'm a clean fighter but I've got a positive test ,conner benn
Clomid?
Benn is done. You let everyone down.
I don't care about no drug tests, the sport is rife and, Eubanks just probably managed is choice of meds better..
Connor Ben is a wet yute
It's a step to getting this sport cleaned ..at least the best way possible slowly but I think this type of course should be made in every time someone test positive .for a banned substance
He waz always juiced to the gills😉
🤦🏿‍♂️
Ben never fight again utter disgrace
Black cheeter
Benn lost a lot of fans smh, he was never confident in himself.
I bet Benn will say he doesn't know how it happened and its all a big mistake blah blah blah
Team Eubank all the way
Loved this sport up until this year. I now HATE it.
Massive let down, what a shame to the sport of boxing and how corrupted it has become, money corrupts everything, look at the world for example 🤷‍♂️
He was getting knockout anyway winker
Silly little rich kids
Conor hasbenn.......its all over
Cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat
In the future in such situations there should be mandatory fines paid to the opponent and under card boxers to cover training camp expenses
Benn = cheat.. proper let down.. B sample is the same as A ffs .. if B came back OK then there's more chance that's been tampered with rather than the A sample
Thrusts a major doubt over Benns recent improvement roiding the whole time perhaps?
THIS RUINED BENN CAREER
Until the b sample come back its no ones fault and it really is the bbbc that is to blame as they shouldn't off sanctioned it in the first place as they new about this in august
"born" rivals
What would a fertility drug do?
I’m with majority boxing fans it has too be called off until all the facts are out
I'm sad to hear this news but it was the right call, I feel bad for Eddie Chris dazn the other boxers and fans that booked hotels ect. hopefully Eddie and co get a bit of luck soon because I want everyone to be doing well in the sport.
I hope conor has a safe pregnancy 👨🏾‍🍼
I think there’s still a chance we can get the fight on for Saturday
Mr hearn is having a bad year isn’t he😂😂
Eubank 2 1 draw benn 0
Boxing is in such a decline man. They forced these two to fight for the legacy thing which doesnt even make sense because of the weight difference, and one of them doesnt pass a drugs test! Boxing is a declining sport.
What a mess
This is the right decision. The Boxing authorities couldn't possibly allow it to go ahead because of the precedent it would set.
Was the right call. If Eubanks got hurt, that wax the end of the sport
A FERTILITY DRUG PEOPLE NEED TO GET OFF THEIR SOAP BOXES.
Eubank snr knew something was bubbling. A complete mismatch was obvious Benn was going to do a Brock Lesnar. Disgraceful
Conor Benn must Identify as a Woman now, I don’t want to hear the excuses lol
This will hurt Nigel Benn the most.
The boxers on the undercard need to get paid. It’s not their fault that the fight is off. Benn should be suspended for his behavior. Canceling the fight was the right thing to do. I still feel bad for the boxers on the undercard.
Really hope he hasn't deliberately cheated we all make mistakes but with all the claims of being a top class professional athlete does not boad well. 🇬🇧✌️
We support Conor until proven guilty . He is innocent as from now . Respect that cxxksuckers or I'll give you some of the left hand .
Conor how could you do this to Nigel
Should never box again the cheat
He knew he’d lose that’s why he took drugs
Sad gutted why stupid kids let down gutted get well ben🙏
congrats  to Edie Hearn for ruining two events in such a short time Fury vs AJ and Benn VS CHEJr. It is your fault Mr. Hearn.
Drug commonly used as post cycle therapy following a steroid cycle. Seems news reporters are overlooking this as a standalone test booster. There's no reason for him to have a drug used for womens infertility in his system. Quite ironic how he pushed for the fight, put all these clauses for Eubank to be disadvantaged. Yet ontop wants to be PED cheat
Eubank jnr = professional  Connor Benn = unprofessional
Boxing has become a joke again
fumbled the bag
Sorry for the ticket buyers but it was a silly fight based on weight regardless. If Benn can get clean maybe he can be fed to Ortiz or Ennis as punishment.   Eubank should be trying to fight Golovkin. He needs a relevant name on his resume.
Conor Steroid Balls Ben
Gutted
I know Sky sport is having a cheers moment...  as DAZN's annual revenue plummets. Eddy would be begging Fury for a fight now....anything-Chisora -Fury?
rah annoyed was really looking forward to this fight....would of been good
He’s smaller so he should be allowed to take roids 😅
Absolutely disappointing from Benn
Conor will never get that chance again . No one to blame but himself .
no wonder hes crushing it in the gym
Apparently, the VADA sample was taken in August. What's going on?
Conor Trenn 💉
Complete and utter joke.... Thanks for letting us all down.
All parties knew about this problem weeks ago but kept quiet about it. They carried on as if everything was ok and fully intended for the fight to go ahead KNOWING that there was a failed drugs test. It was only when the situation was exposed by a national newspaper that they did an about turn, even now, none of those involved, Matchroom, DAZN, Eubank Jnrs team have shown any regret or contrition. Yet another stain on Boxings reputation and more ammunition for those that want this 'sport' banned permanently.
Benns going to get some right hate now!
What a absolute joke 😂😂😂😂between this crowd and AJ ABS TYSON there killing the sport
At least now Benn walks away still able to say Eubank didn't beat him 🤣
Tbh looking at it now. Felt way too rushed. Eubank senior should have been onboard from day 1
Who says 💉 don't make u a better fighter benn n that gym went from area level fighters to world level in a year
BBB C should have acted earlier or not at all
His daddy cheated the GMEN MCCLEANAN
Well there is no point in signing up to VADA if no one is not going to take any notice of it
They knew about this in August, there should be a class action lawsuit in favour of EVERYONE who has incurred costs because they chose to sit on the information rather than disclose it to everyone involved as soon as they were aware.
Feel gutted for the undercard boxers putting in a hard 3months hard training camp for absolutely nothing 😪
conor the con man.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!
I knew it wouldn't go ahead I didn't no why it wouldn't I just knew we wouldn't get to see this
BAN HIM FOR LIFE NO EXCUSES
Tony Bellew now you choose to go home to your wife and kids, where are you now we want your opinion 🤔
Con ner bent
I didn't think Sky was aware this fight was happening based on the lack of reports until this all kicked off...
UNREAL…This was such a massive fight, biggest for decades in U.K….it won’t be the same if it EVER happens MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE let down ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
Ban Eddie Hearn from boxing
THEY Can't KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!!!!
Another nail in boxings coffin
Boxing appears to be one head-in-hands moment after another currently.  Benn fails a VADA test but the money-grubbing promoters choose to give a statement having a pop at the BBBOC.
Never let him fight again,I don’t care who they are,drugs out
Cheat. Lifetime ban
I really wanted this fight to go ahead, especially as the father's bouts were so exciting! But if you need to drug take to enhance your chances of winning, then No THANK YOU!
It wasn’t gonna happen, pure publicity stunt.
What with Tyson and AJ and now this what is boxing coming to its CRAP !!!!!
🙄
Conor Benn has always been unlikable and he just made it worse for himself. Will never be a star
Look anyone with a decent brain in their heads understands this fight will now be in a stadium , this was the talk all along, nothing at all to do with drug abuse.... They realise they can make mega bucks out this than anyone dreamed , still watch it when it comes back around tho lol 🤣😜
Ffs these promoter's and fighter's are getting as bad as Jake Paul for cancelling fights
Eddie Hearn 1 million buys.. sorry lies.. Game Over
We never got Dillian Whytes B Sample. “Havnt received Connors B Sample as of yet” 😂
both men need to be 100pc fit and clean for a fight like this
Where’s that stooge Tony bellew ? Funny that! You’ll Neva see me agen kuuuuugz
RIP to Benn’s reputation
Sounds like conner is trying to become a daddy.  All meds aren't ment for the ring but life after. Ijs
GOOD.  This is fate taking immediate revenge on Hearn — for depriving us of Fury vs AJ.
So sad for the sport and the world of boxing 🥊🔥 😞
Basically, UkAD got paid VADA didn't oppsie
Eubanks 3 - 0 Benns
It is the right call but Eubank and the undercard need to be fully paid by Matchroom. They shouldn't have to suffer because Benn cheated.
WA WA WA
That stuff doesn’t just end up in your system. Gutted.
Deny, Deny ,Deny...  Lance Armstrong
Game Changed
Wow
Well done to the British Board. 👏 Despite the repugnant Eddie Hearn's attempt to superseded them. That man needs banning from boxing, endangering fighters health to line his pocket.
Someone's payed varda off to fail him how do you pass all other tests then fail another they both knew how much testing would go on in this fight boxing is so dodgy
Bro drugs mess everything up! 🥊👎🏾
I'm just waiting on Gareth A Davies to pop up
Hahaha
Massive L
C'mon Sky last as usual! 🙄
We already knew what the result would be but it would've been such a good fight
Eubank JNR  VS  Eddie Hearn
I don't care it's off both fighters are average Lol
..
Well done Conner Benn you jeopardised the fight
I'm glad they're doing the right thing, instead of letting the drug test pass in favor of the fight; we don't need more corruption in boxing 🙄
Eddie Hearn a disgrace trying to keep this fight alive.
Hardly surprising after a failed drugs test
Good.
💉 💪🏽💉💪🏽
Saw this coming tbh
The only time sky covered it 😂
Is it off or on dam
Really
Ffs excited for this
Conor benn let everyone down
