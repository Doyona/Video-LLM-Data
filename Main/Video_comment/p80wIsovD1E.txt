I love Randy Orton
Orton and Triple H feud is hella intense
3:50 Badtameez 😂 Orton
You live by the sword you die by the sword such a great line 0:40
First line was funny, now in 2021 just turned personal
3:05 the same ahh bars back before super showdown
Luv u Randy ❤❤
1:28randy orton remembering 2009😅
When Randy Orton brought Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley into the picture, he should've known better.
What did Triple H say around 1:09-1:13?...
We need this Randy back badly
Hahahaha
Even with fans just watching online, this was great. It was still entertaining as wwe used to be before.
Triple H Should be The Next Kratos😂
I am here after tonight's SmackDown kicked off with Orton - Triple H 🔥
Randy send em ALL PACKIN
He's called the Legend Killer for a reason, Triple H.
Kratos vs randy orton 😁😂
2:52
I miss this raw theme
RANDY SENT THEM ALL TO AEW N HBK TO NXT
Triple H’s final match.
I remember that but triple h had a good reason too after what Orton did too his wife.
The King of the Kings Vs. The Apex Predator.  They are the greatest rivalry in WWE history.
3:05 2019 all over again lol
This was Triple H's last match and it happened in an empty arena. 😢
Hi    My     Name      is        Jordan    Hillery
Triple h easily the greatest wrestler in my opinion
3:33
Covid randy 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
3:32
Randy Orton is the real victim, they turned on Orton for no reason in 2004. That serves HHH right when Orton destroyed and terrorized the whole mcmahon family in 2009 and his former teammates (Evolution)
Triple h Cant understand why randy attacked ric flair but yet in 2005 triple h attacked ric flair for no reason an they had a brutal match at survivor series that year
Triple H is a hypocrite, he really forgot that when Randy won his first world heavyweight championship ever, Hunter cheated on Randy for no reason, Randy was right when he destroyed the McMahon family with Legacy, he was right the whole time!!!
This is exactly the first day i started watching for the first time, wwe. But not in the *now* kshow. I was watching matches, may episodes, matches. When i started the *now* it was since edge lost to roman. And since then to now, i watch what happens now
This was a rivalry that will never get old love to see randy and triple h in the ring again after so many years of hating each other
And here I thought Triple H's last match was at WM 35 against Batista
0:00
I like wwe is the best
Only me understand why Randy Orton did all of that..
Randy orton will Rko triple H
Within two years, after this promo, Mark Henry and Paul Wight went to AEW, Randy got injured, Triple H had to be hospitalized and Jeff Hardy showed up at AEW, got arrested then came back, CM Punk making his AEW debut, suspended then came back. Punk then got terminated after a fight with Jack Perry, and returned to WWE in 2024.
Orton and Roman saved WWE at the pandemic period
3:33. Ouch.  Something tells me Randy was expecting that.
Didn't Randy ask him that before
Your unable to retrieve your balls from her purse😂😂 classic roast
All hail King Dom
RKO THE VIPER vs. HHH THE GAME
3:03 “ or is just steph your wife isn’t here tonight ! So you’re unable to retrieve your balls from her purse “ 😂
3:11 like the June 3 2019 orton special joke lol
when the old man HHH aka the game, aka the cerebral assassin, aka the king of kings need to understand what's in the viper head all this time lol
What happened to Triple h and Stephanie McMahon
Balls segment 2019-2021 Randy Orton😂
Randy Orton and Triple H
randy orton hit him w the you left your balls in her purse 😂😂😂
triple h standing like kratos 😂
2 years ago
2 greatest rivalry of all time
I knew Randy would bring up his balls being in Stephanie's purse.
I always think back on the day HHH turned on Orton after he became champion.  Not that Randy is the type to hold grudges but man, you can't forget that & he hasn't when he mentioned that ball purse insult 🤣
Ugh I'm so sad we can't see HHH wrestle for the very last time due to his condition 😢 man I miss that dude when he's in the ring.
That looked like he really hit him
Pandemic Randy Orton was unbelievable
the two men who put this company on their back when it needed it most at the turn of the decade
randy orton joy vandnrvort
Nice
DAMN! 3:13
Orton is better than the game triple h
What a Story History between Triple H and Randy Orton from 2002-2021
Triple H is officially retired from Wwe. Thank You HHH we hope see you soon at HOF 2023!
POV: you’re here after Triple H announced his retirement
Triple H's last official match. Thank you, Game.
Thank you Triple H
That’s triple h❤️❤️❤️💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🔥🆒
You know the "VIPER" Randy Orton will get his revenge against HHH (Help, Help, Help).

CRINGE XRODEE : First Time Watching This Again And Liking On This Video JULY 17, 2021
Or sending them to AEW 😂
Did triple h shrunk in height as he got older?
Expect the Unexpected. The person wants a fight. Remember. He or she asks for it
HHH KING OF KINGS.   ALWAYS...
I don't like that Randy recycled that "balls from Stephanie's purse" line.. A bit unoriginal 🤷‍♂️
Its fitting that Hunter is wearing a grey suit and black trousers thats innmy mind vinces attire
Randy Orton has always been better then triple HHH and Batista and mark Henry, Ric Flair Shawn Michaels, edge ,Christian, and big show theirs a reason they call the legend Killer Randy Orton
Randy Orton has always been better then triple HHH and Batista and mark Henry, Ric Flair Shawn Michaels, edge ,Christian, and big show theirs a reason they call the legend Killer Randy Orton
Randy Orton has always been better then triple HHH and Batista and mark Henry, Ric Flair Shawn Michaels, edge ,Christian, and big show theirs a reason they call the legend Killer Randy Orton
1:11 thought a rko was going to happen
Can someone tell me is the pg era over or whats happening here?
Randy Orton : So HHH your wife..... HHH : So you ve chosen a miserable  and tortured death.
triple h look like bud spencer
Triple H and Randy Orton...one of the most personal rivalries that has ever lived.
Why does trips shave his head. Doesn't look like he's balding.
Triple h looks like Kojack 🙉🙉🙉🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Steph heard Randy's comeback about her 💀
Love when randy say "retrieve your balls from Stephanie's purse" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great to see Orton and Triple H talking some old times once in a while. We need to see another Wrestlemania match between them.
How do these spectators pay for theit seats?
Triple H won that match.
Retired your old n washed up
Here bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:09 the hell did he call him?
Randy is my favorite his story lines are always top tier
I am happy triple h said what he said and did what he did orton was out of line game over you are darn right I'm over
hhh needa have randy retire him
We Want Hunter Legend
I seriously thought these two would compete against one another at WrestleMania.
triple h  sy randy orton joy back
"You were unable to retrieve your balls from her purse"
Is that simulation audience sound?
I remembered Legacy vs McMahon
3:32-3:33 what the hell was that noise lol
mask covid
One of These days, one of These dayș some of You gonna eat a lot of tomatoes and after You will die! Have a Nice day! Don't ever underestimate The power of will! Have a Nice day!😎
The balls in the purse ew why this video randy stop say that ok
Love 2 see Triple H around more often... But he is doing well with managing Nxt  Randy has a lot of potential but the bliss script is madness.
Randy has been on tv every week for almost 20 years thats why he is my fave.
Attach a very model you’ve never done it we all future shut up believe Manny would’ve
what did he say in the censored? a hint will do good since i cant read through the lips
Doesn't feel the same with no live crowd
HHH: I don't understand why you are attacking and humiliating the legends.  Orton: Uh, because I am the Legend Killer.  You gave me that moniker in are early days of evolution.  Remember?
A no good ...what !
Triple H....he isnt like he used to be..
Bro wtf am i trippin’ or are ppl really saying that triple h ain’t that good in wrestling? Bro maybe now he got a lil old, but the amount of sick matches he had is insane, so how can ppl say he ain’t good in wrestling I think I’m trippin’ wtf
Hhh has always kept himself in shape he doesn't drink or smoke that's why he looks good and can still go with the young guys
Triple h vs aj styles plz make that happen
Randy should be the one to retire triple h it makes sense.
I would love for Randy's last opponent before he retires to be The Rock HHH or John Cena
Weirdos
These fakking Corona rules, pathetic ..
Triple H can take it and he can dish it out as well.
Triple H got a nice beard going on there
I reckon we will get fiend vs Orton in a firefly funhouse match and triple h vs AJ styles at mania this year
Triple H a true OG
Technically he never said he could get his balls from Stephanie 🤣 we understand Trips it's a lot of pressure to have balls 🤣
the stephanie line is a little hackneyed isn't it??
Connor McGregor went to the wwe now?
"I'm a legend on my own time " Orton say
Let’s not forget triple h used to smash a dude named chyna
Triple H. My most favourite wrestler of all time! I wish he'd trim his beard back down though. Although he's 51, I recon he'd look a lot younger without that long beard. It ages him terribly! 😔
3:07 I swear this one was even funnier than when he said it in 2019 the fact he was so serious and proper when he said it made it 10x more hilarious😂😂😂😂
Yo randy looks younger?
Zaiden And Jessica 📱 Brandon Nintendo Switch
triple h is my favorite since 2000  my favorite match is 3 stages of hell vs steve austin
O
The purse line killed me😀😀😀😹
One more time
Randy orton is the best 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I know this sounds crazy but picture this Triple H as NXT Champion, just one run
Even years later these two can Still give me tension when they are on the mic gotdammit love em 😂
mkay
Now THAT is 'outta nowhere.'
Damn
Randy Orton vs Triple H at WM retirement match of triple H will happen
Randy gone roasting everybody! 🤣🤣🤣
Childhood
who remembered Randy kissing stephanie
This two on wrestlemania?
I just wanna dx to come back!
Triple H and Randy can work together at any time and still put together a great match. Two of the very best of all time
Triple h enter the rumble match 2021
No matter what anyone says I will always like randy Orton better than triple h
Maybe this time Kevin nash will get another SMS from a secret individual :D
Go Kratos!!!!
Everytime Triple H was loafing around when you say something bad to him especially when it comes to his wife, he will always have the guts to threw a punch. That is the real Triple H.
Randy: “Stephanie” Triple H: And I took that personally.
I really thought that it was going to be a Pedigree
In 2004 didn’t we establish Randy was the legend killer?
It's like Back to the Future calling Marty McFly a chicken with Stephanie and his balls
Older brother HHH vs younger brother RKO can't wait to see that match!!
I will be glad to see that . Dennis Winship lynn Massachusetts
This is my favorite version of HHH ngl
Who remember when Triple H broke into randy ortans house 😂😂
"balls from her purse" 🤣🤣 far out there's a new one for y'all.,
The memories all coming back...
RKO needs to win the Universal Championship!
This one was good
Kratos
bruh its like deja vu when they last fought lmao
So that’s what I have to do to get Triple H to fight me. Just mention his “bean headed wife”. CM Punk quote
Is Orton's hair thinning at the back? Look closely.
Orton went for triple Hs  head with that line 😯😯😯
How many times randy roasted triple h about retrieving his balls from staphanies purse lol
Randy''s 2021 Gimmick is - CM Punk Cult of Personality. Same hairstyle, beard,  gear, challenging Triple H, sound familiar "" CM Punk 2011""
2009, In Wrestlemania 25   they were young .
Randy , Stephanie wants another kiss 😐
bored
I couldn't make out the swear under the bleep.. what did Triple H say?
makes me remember the feud back in 2004-2005 ..when Randy was so much better and younger :)
Hhh left his manhood in that purse
How you know ratings are going down l
These 2 will be in each other's lives forever....   Anywhere they hold the wwe together they save it
A really good and not too much overacting promo. Really nice! That is what I want to see.
Orton vs HHH is good rivalry
If Orton really wanted to provoke Triple H he could have just reminded him of when he DDT’d Stephanie whilst Triple H was handcuffed then kissed her
WWE still going on. Wow
Randy Orton is the only person left from the aggression era
Anyone wanna drop triple h a pack of lozenges off?
Randy knows how to trigger HHH every time
Randy Orton could make anything look too damn easy. Especially his Mic skills
Randy: Stephanie isn’t here. Triple H: I offered you friendship, and you spat in my face.
That hurt randy he shot on you
Same WWE same fights same story nothing changes
It’s the same insult that randy said when they were about to face each other in Jeddah
Haven't watched wwe in months as soon as triple h returns I find myself interested....
WWE LOL
Ok WTF is this
With subtitles in english, thank you
triple h is consistent performance fight in 51 years old and i think he's better than randy orton
A real legend doesn’t disrespect other legends ya they defeat them but they do it in a respectable way and acknowledge what they have accomplished
Dear god why is this gonna become another wrestlemania main event for triple h. So annoying at this point
Unable to retrieve your balls from her purse! ☺️ icon symbols Randy Orton is on fire with his wordplay.
Go ahead Randy! * 5 ☺️ symbol icon
HHH literally destroyed Ric Flair on Legends Night wym Hunter 😂😂
Enough with the fake crowd noise. You can’t get real fans in there like AEW? Also, you really gonna act like we didn’t hear Randy say that EXACT line like a week ago?
Quick thinking on randy to roll out the ring
Randy Orton's  been the one disrespecting legends all this time and yet Goldberg says Drew Mcintyre has no respect. OK.
I know what the title of the video means but it's just funny how Randy wants Trips to meet him in the ring as they're already meeting here in the ring.
Remember when Triple H lost to Batista in a Career match?  Yeah neither does Triple H
3:00 I've heard this a million times but it's still good 😁
Randy was igniting the Game 1:46 Then he finds out HHH still has it all intact 3:42 😂😂 what a punch 🤛
Ese Randy es el Rey de los Memes, Ojala y alguien haga un YTPH de este Vídeo la Verdad se vería muy Gracioso. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
😴😴😴😴😴
What the hell happened to HHH's legs?
HHH...is just awesome on the mic 🎤
Randy orton has one of the best beard ever
Ouch
Triple H is pleased
Randy Orton and CM Punk just love the "balls in stephanie's purse" joke
Triple H doing what he does best taking them spots from them young hungry talents for the big Shows like Royle Rumble and Of course WRESTLEMANIA!!
Randy forgot his lines again...its cool
Just not the same without real fans...
Orton used this Stephanie line so much, nothing classic about it, just lazy and repetitive... its embarassing HHH would even react to that since its so tired and the dude is old
What’s with randy n balls lol
Chris evans new show wwx cool would
Is Orton back to his legend killer self?
2009 best rivaly of the decade
Triple H, even at 51, can still to this day go with the best of them. He still has a few more left in him.
I don't know about any of you guys in the comments but at 0:38 l was waiting for the firefiy fun House theme to randomly interrupt triple h✌🏿️✌🏿
Randy Orton started it all with Triple H 18 years ago in Evolution.
Its like they're rewriting HHH's fued  with CM Punk. I literally remember Punk using the "Balls in purse" remark to HHH and it ended with HHH throwing a right hand to punk in that exact same  promo. I'm fully convinced Vince has dementia.
"I don't understand you kicking legends in the head."  Do... do you not remember _any_ of the first five years of his career, my dude? Where he went around calling himself "Legend Killer" and punting dudes in the head? I mean, you were kind of there when it was happening.
Remember when HHH was the main heel in the attitude era when He injured rivals attacking Ric Flair after a match in 2005
Randy Orton is carrying the wwe for all the vets
Randa orton coward
I swear triple h looks like kratos 2018
The game is back 🔥
this again 🙄
Question? Are those cheers are fake?
Why do we need to see this now again when these can hardly move.
Not sure is it Triple H or Kratos
Oh god... Not this tired fued again. Does this company ever try to establish new stars? Or just recycle the same ones from the past no one wants to see. First goldberg, now this.. Same old tired balls from purse line everyone uses against Hunter
Orton finish what little dignity hunter has left. End the game once and for all Randy!
Zzzzzz
Kratos is about to go wild
Vim pelo wwe em geral . 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
How many times are they gonna use the balls in the purse gag. . And why does it still work. Lol
HHH is the only wrestler who gets ahead by f_ckin the bosses daughter
No one wants to see triple h wrestle. Hell, no one wants to see triple h on their tv screen period.
Sad.wheres the new wreslers.Damn.
I can’t believe I used to watch this stuff
Triple H should play kratos before he gets too old
Ah yes when WWE gets boring, put these two in a ring together. Between the breaking in ones house and DDT the others wife, I can smell 2009 in the air lmao
I became a fan of hhh with that rivalry in 09!!
Rivalry is cool, but Orton said same thing awhile back during their rivalry. Will WWE Creative please let Orton be more creative? Bc I'm sure he can. Been hearing a lot about AEW product. Might wanna check it out.  Seen a little. I'll always be wwe but let them speak w/out writing lines Vince! Stone cold talked about this & he never done that, everything along with The rock. & others wasn't scripted. Just sayin wwe....
I Remember When Randy Attacked The McMahons And RKO’d Stephanie In Front Of Triple H When He Was Handcuffed.
Your balls from your prouse lol 😂
You know somebody's getting old when their voice is starting to sound like the undertaker...
Why is it always “Hey HHH, steph got ya nuts or what????”
Ok by why did Triple H call Randy a No-Good N-word? I felt that was very offensive.
Randy Orton for the Raw Tag Team Championship and a Triple Crown winner
Triple H le pateara el trasero
Great Rivalry between these two but One of the Worst Wrestlemania Main Events they EVER HAD‼️
Bruh were gonna get triple h vs Randy again for the millionth time
Nice
Hi
Randy orton has always hated hunter. Hes spat in his face and rkod stephanie sending hunter into a raging bull both times
This already happened... More than once... BORING BORING BORING
I would go back to watching if it wasn't for that "crowd" and "crowd sounds"
Triple H look like Kratos lmao
Ah HHH you get provoked so easily
Triple h don’t don’t do it don’t wrestle orton
Quit picking on legends randy is a bully he beats up old retired wrestlers why why why
Lol I love it
Randy orton is gorgeous 😍 yummy
🥱
Randy and HHH chemistry is still flawless
A no good what?
Steph: *isn't there* Randy to Triple H: "You have forfeited life privileges."
It's great to see The Game The CEO Triple H, when he fights it instantly becomes real like real fight that's how great this rivalry is, yes we want to that battle and more of Triple H on Raw, we do need the Captain on this ship
The balls from her purse line took me back to the last time hhh and randy faced each other and the promos for it were amazing and so was the match
Randy is HHH son in WWE exactly the same type of chaos
little lame but ok
When nore with the clowns working there that should not be  like fun house waste of time n money n those who working that stuip show
Really seriously hhh gone missing what a joke n that idoit girl comes in n sends fire to randy what a freaking hoke this company just sad sack  boring as hell
It’s funny how Randy Orton hurts and threatens them and he is also one
Hhh finishes him
Sorry, can't get into a bunch of monitors spread around the perimeter of the ring with fans that actually thought, great my face will be on a monitor while I'm watching the matches.
They'll be digging up dead wrestlers for Orton to challenge soon
Randy has matured a blonde orton would be boss..
only seen this about 1000 times before
Game is the Best
what a knock out! he still got it.
A no good what?the beard was in the way
Randy is without a doubt, a legend!
These veterans know how to cut a promo and get you invested in a match.
Randy: Your wife— HHH: Death it is then.
Kratos is that you?
wait what he said
Kodak black in the cut lol 3:31
1:15 that’s Covid right there 🤣
What's this another wrestle mania build up match, this is the problem with wwe these days still relying on old stars, can't build any new stars anymore!!!
Gawd there matches together were boring......... Putting it out there
What did he say a no good what ? 2021 and still censoring
Ric Flair should've never formed Evolution these guys have been at each other throats since day one.
Get him triple h always the game .
I don’t understand how wwe think this is a good idea... Randy orton said the same stuff last time and triple h just talks in his Deep voice...
Without a crowd it shows me that hhh is a legend
Randy Orton Vs Triple H vs Covid19🤣🤣 right in each others face🤣
Orton is brilliant when he is like this.
They should have the fake  Crowd noise randomly start Cheering  C M punk 😀
Place maintain a social distance please
Was this a repeat? I've seem the Orton HHH balls out of your wife's purse bit before, as well as the Flair Evans match where Dad interferes.
This is better than anything roman could think of doing.
What I don’t understand is why there is no “social distance” between them
Randy has been working double time recently. He has just been showing up for B-tier matches the last few years, but 2020 has been A-tier all around for him.
WWE is trash these days!
Wait he’s actually back I just found this
Who things they should have one more match at this year's wrestelemania that would be a good match to see
WWE has forgotten how to create new superstars. Randy Orton is practically all that’s left of the good old days on the full time main roster. Might as well make every night “Legends Night.”
No social distancing at a time when America has the most cases of Covid19
Triple H with that raspy voice out of nowhere. Like father-in-law like son-in-law
Wwe is weak now. Back then less rules, more action💪🏿🤘🏿. And best of all, more Ogs
Randy Orton : Stephanie isn't here.  Triple H : *so you've chosen death*
Wrinkle  in the forehead no bueno amigo
عثث🦸‍♂️🇸🇭🚁🇭🇲🇭🇹🇭🇰🇭🇳🇭🇺🇭🇷🇸🇭🚁🤾‍♀️🤾‍♂️🛕🏑ثخن٣خخ٣مث😀
I miss the John Cena , Randy Orton and Big show rivals
Lmao is this 2004
A no good what???
"Can't make stars, lets throw out HHH.... Again".
If this really happens I’m signing up to wwe live
You know when Stephanie is brought up something is going to happen.
The fake crowd noise ruins it
Can’t get enough of legends
Randy is the greatest 9f all time
What did he call Orton that was censored ?
I clicked on this to see what more could these two can do in the ring or on the mic.
He’s said that to Hunter before like get some new writers
No good what?
This is literally the same promo as Triple H vs Undertaker End of An Era.
Petition for HHH to be Kratos!
Is that rusev 1:19🤔?
HHH is being a snowflake
Is it just me or does anyone else feel they can’t take this seriously with a bunch of screens in the background 😂
HHH vs Orton at Wrestlemania ?
Randy orton one of the best heels I seen throughout my whole childhood live
Ok their tryna bring back the og rivalry, show still trash tho now
Flash back from when the viper was really the viper when he had a feud with triple H, one of the best storyline in history
"I am in my prime" Nah. Prime Orton was 2009.
Who remembers when he came on Monday night raw and had a poster of him spitting in Triple H face. It was one of the best rivalries of the modern era 🐍🐍🐍🐍
Happy new year.
Happy 2021.
Use to like Randy Orton but now I'm 100% on triple h's side can't stand Orton
2003: Evolution Starts 2004: Randy Orton Wins the World Heavyweight Title becomes the 1st Member of the Group to Leave.  2005: Triple H Defeated Randy Orton at Royal Rumble 2005.  2006: Orton forms Rated RKO with Edge to Feud with DX.  2007: Randy Orton beats Triple H at No Mercy to become WWE Champion the 2nd Time in 1 Night.  2008: Randy Orton defeated Both Cena and HHH at WM XXIV in a Triple Threat to Retain the WWE Title.  2009: Randy Orton eliminates HHH to Win his 1st of 2nd Royal Rumble Victories and Feuded with HHH that Years 25 Anniversary of WM.  2019: Randy Orton faces HHH at SSD  2021: Randy Orton faces Triple H on RAW.  Note: Is there anything missing, just comment.
I like how Randy & HHH fight. It’s good to see again, especially HHH in the ring again  But What’s up wth the way WWE is treating Ric flair. One day their Evolution next he’s getting punted in the head because all Orton Push, even with Charlotte  Why not have Ric stand by Orton breaking his 16x championship & fighting John Cena one day to break and stand by Charlotte WWE creations I tell you.
A no good what?!?!
3:18 looks like Bray Wyatt with a black and white nWo shirt
Lmfaooo 😭😂 that balls in purse roast sure can drive any man crazy😂😂
hey remember back then when randy orton provoked HHH by kissing unconscious stephanie mcmahon??
Randy rolled like Neymar Jr. , lol 3:35
My god time really flies I remember being a kid watching these 2 go at it now they just old of 😂
They were talking to close where's the 1.5 m distance, m8? I thought they were bout to fight with their lips🤐
I remember that purse line from CM Punk
Wowwww!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
you got "punched" by HHH while he wore Katie Vick's bracelet
balls in her purse makes me remember cm punk
I hope triple H inducts Randy in the hall of fame when Randy is done.
On attend ce combat ce du waooooooh 🇨🇩🇨🇩💯
The Cerebral Assassin is right here!  😏
randy used that exact line and sequence with triple h about 5 years ago.
If god of war makes a movie pleeeeease have triple h play kratos
Their rivalry in 2009 was  legendary
randy needs to seriously be in discussions for wrestler of the year. this man has literally carried raw on his shoulders during the pandemic
I MADE YOU IN EVALUATION
Wrestlemania? I want to see Triple H beat his....
Using the same line of the ball and the purse.
He is a legend with those punches
when are the crowds coming back
Triple H still has it deep down on him. The Game is top 5 easily.
Rick needed to get his head kicked lol.
Why did they cut what triple h said? 1:08
Now he needs kicking triple h in skull
I hear a WrestleMania main event going on!!
الله عليكم منو عربي
:)
Watching these two in the ring makes me feel like it's the late 2000s again.
Thought somebody was twerking @ *1:53*
I wana see hhh come out to his 1999 jam " 1....2... is this on" "yo Jimmy hit me with that triple h"
Wwe getting desperate with ratings so low. They bout to throw the big guns in. Dont worry after it will suck again. Wwe is getting Purdy Purdy bad nowadays
People that remeber cm punk using the line 🤝
3:07what you say to your homie when he ask his wife if you can hung out with the boys 3:15 his reaction
atropelou
welp hunter got himself a ticket to punt kick city
Did HHH actually hit Orton in the face??? It looked too real to be a pulled punch....
Remember when randy ddted Stephanie
randy jst knows how to get his matches!!! hes a badass 💯
The undertaker would  come back to defeat Randy order.
Randy and his legend fetish :O
I'm starting to get DE JAVU with this stuff.  They could have just cut & pasted the HHH's balls in Stephanie's purse bit from the last time they were in the ring together a couple years ago...🥜👛
so everyone from 2009 is back now ?
I never seen some one that happen to get punched lmao
Love the promo work by both. This is what I miss with today's WWE. Only a few can hype a match like Orton and HHH who didn't even have a match last year but is still amazing on the mic
top de mais
Randy smart 🐍♥️
L
And also: 2004 - The Evolution (HHH, Flair & Batista (HEEL)) VS Randy Orton (FACE) 2007 - The Evolution (HHH, Flair & Batista (FACE)) VS Randy Orton (HEEL)
2004 - Triple H (HEEL) VS Randy Orton (FACE) 2009 - Triple H (FACE) VS Randy Orton (HEEL)
Welcome Back triple h in the ring after two years
HHH was a good wrestler not a great wrestler Randy is a better wrestler than HHH ever was
Triple H would beat Randy sensless
HHH still one of the greatest of all time, Orton , way better than his pops... priceless.  Thanks for still entertaining us.
I mean, with Drew out I guess they HAD to go back to the well, but... c'mon. (rolls eyes)
How many times have people pulled the “you left your balls in Stephanies Purse” line on HHH
For a second, I thought they were kissing
First row baby
Okay I’m gonna need new joke material. The Stephanie jokes are just corny now.
There Rivalry Of Randy Orton And Triple H In 2009 Was Good
Triple h 🖕🏻😡🤬
Randy has really gotten back into his grove 👍
@guresturkiye
What if this isnt hhh what if this is the fiend playing games
Didint they settle their rivalry the last time they faced eachother?
Why do I hear boss music?
It's brilliant Hunter is putting over young talent like Randall  Orton
I lowkey wanna see Cena vs Randy again
I really don't want these two to fight in the ring  no more.
What was the word that got censored at 1:15
It really all started in 2004 with the veteran triple h being jealous of orton
3:33 I don’t know why that part was so funny lmao. All you heard was “Red hit—OH!”
And also sub to my channel
I was here
Please WWE, give us another Randy Orton VS Triple H rivalry. 😩
What a way to start off 2009!
Albeit I am not the hugest fan of the current product, I feel nostalgic and grateful for these two to be still at the top!   *Random but I just wish Stone Cold Steve Austin wrestled longer than 02-03, was still wrestling and/or at least heavily involved on Raw.*
That exact scene and words,  you've already done this 😂😂
Randy always use Stephanie against triple H even kissed Stephanie's lips in the ring when HHH was tied along the rope 🔥🔥
Good To See Triple H Back
Man Orton Digging Out His All enemies Lol
Randy Orton vs Triple H in 2021
3:33 Man Triple H working that snap into perfection
Too cocky to be true !
Got to love Randy Orton though, he's the perfect heel at the moment. He's truly at his peak now
i mean its gonna be a hell of a storyline and match but WWE PLEASE dont let Hunter win again!
Evolution !!!
I wish the cameras weren’t zooming on their faces; damn man! They are both old 😔
Triple H is not Triple H without his hairs
Everytime Triple H gets scared/backs out of something, the superstar has to mention his wife, Stephanie McMahon.
Randy Orton and Triple h have good chemistry
bring CENA back all of them get the spot & championships it's cena's turn come on where is he ??!!!! bring him full time on raw
I consider myself lucky enough to Witness these 2 in a match live. Super Showdown 2019. The best match that night!!!
That would be boring
Are they really building these 2 up to face at mania
Why does Triple H always have to sound like Batman
Hey, I've seen this one
And isnt triple h the one who encouraged randys behavior.??????
Everyone who wants to get under the skin of Triple H always used the (take your balls out of Stephanie’s purse like) to rile him up and I always works
I wish HHH was there last week on Legends Night Raw that wouldve been best for business
HHH vs Orton... Ahhhh yes, the classics teaching the kids how it's done.
Time the play the game baby 💀💀
Good old Seth Rollins trick
The fiend changed randy
stupid
Possible that Batista returns to cost HHH the match so they have their Wrestlemania match that was teased a couple years back
HHH is The Kratos in WWE
RKO!!!
Cm punk line stealing here...
Has the fiend corrupted randy Orton?? Is that the angle there goin for. He's never been the same since his rivalry started with him
My idol for ever Triple H!!!
I think triple h wanted to give randy  a kiss being so close
PIPE BOMB !!!!!
Get your balls from Steph's purse Hunter 😂😂
I'm old enough to remember when CM Punk said the same line to Triple H..
This rivalry started in 2004 and then 2007 after that 2009. Again in 2019 and now 2021
I guess these 2 aren't afraid of Covid then 🤔 😷
Its time to play the game
لن
ي
لا
ممو
هههههه
ال
2004 2007 2008 2009 2014 2015 2019 2021 they will fight till the end of time 😂😂
Randy legit just took the "balls frpm her purse" line from CM Punk
Randy Orton : Triple H ruined my life
“Randy Uh”  “Doh!”
Nice crowd LOLOL
Retrieve your balls from stephanie's purse🤣🤣🤣
Randy i stand by ur side😂
It would be interesting if Randy brought up the whole DDTing and kissing Stephanie
The last legend left from the attitude era.. the one who’s been there from the beginning til the end, they’ve come and go but the king has never been dethroned. The GOAT of wrestling whether you like it or not, or you don’t wanna except it, but it’s true.  Still in top shape, and he’s still not done making history.
Everyone talking about 2009 what about 2004
What a super punch  now this is super punch
Randy Orton vs Triple H in Royal Rumble 2021
Who cares
Randy is just a Goat man Carrying WWE on his shoulder
I Guess Raw would of done anything to get back on 🔝
I thought this rivalry ended between these two at Super-Showdown 2019. Can never believe wrestling in ending certain things
This show sucks soooooooo bad! 😑
1:21 wtf that’s Dean Ambrose in disguise
What look like this about evolution the legend or betray the legend :  2019 Batista : batista returns turn heel attack the legend ric flair at the backstage and break the legend birthday and give attention to hhh   2020 Randy Orton : Randy turn on to the legend and punt kick ric flair  2021: is this gonna be hhh will turn on to ric flair that we never know😞 hope is nothing gonna happen to legend ric flair😌
i think this is first time that we saw triple h without a tan
This is almost identical to the promo they did for super showdown or whatever it was called.
Anytime Hunter grabs a mic, he makes anything seem interesting or important.
When ratings are so bad, they bring HHH back to wrestle.
1:11 “no good” what?
I love rko from Indonesia,👑👑👑👑👑👒
Making money is easier through investment don't save your money buy assets and invest
Randy you shouldn't have let him get close...
Wait so ur telling the fiend was a face this whole time ?
Royle Rumble all the legends Randy has disrespected will come out and hope to see Kane there two
Let’s keep it a buck......... Randy Orton has been in his bag lately
Sad they have to bring HHH to help what they have done with Randy let alone what he has done to himself
I think this may be' the final act of Triple H in ring career
HHH could really play Kratos. He got the look.
Randy definitely got that balls in the purse from cm punk
Randy Orton and Triple H opener the Raw show this is amazing and this remember my they rivality in 2009 and this is amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I havent watched wwe properly since 015 as soon as I saw this on recommended I clicked straight away
nah i dont like randy vs triple h wrestlemania 37 the rock vs triple h people
triple h will fight randy orton entire life WTF is going on they have 16 years rivalry
ORTON THE GOD AND BEST
Orton vs triple h at wrestlemania 37
Wonder if Randy Orton got chance to take on Japanese wrestlers like Tetsuya Naito, Kota Ibushi, Hiroshi Tanahashi etc
2008 Vibes
Randy Orton vs Triple H is one of the greatest rivalries of all time
TRIPLE H SPIT SHINES HIS OWN HEAD
Randy hurt Christian on the Legends episode.  Why wasn't he mentioned?   This was a serious insult to Christian.
Triple H has a Kratos thing going...
Writer  "Legends Night failed, Dear Vince, what do we do now?!" Vince "We hit the Ultimate panic button..."  Writer "You don't mean..." Vince " I do..." Sound system "Behold the King, the King of Kings..."
Orton vs Triple h wrestlemania
Its definitely a royal rumble match.
Are they that unoriginal they repeat the same nuts insult every time there's a feud?
So as someone who didn't watch the show did he get challenged and this was confrontation or does HHH accept for a fight down the road?
2:52 Ole girl in the back reaction to HHH answer 😂😂
1:12 what was the word???
Randy 💪🏻
To get triple h to agree to a match with u tell him he left his balls in Stephanie’s purse works like a charm..
What was the censored word, I cant tell
He stole the purse line from CM Punk lol
This is all just a build up for Randy Orton to fight the Rock
Again ?
Orton is now the same age that Triple H was at WrestleMania 25, how time moves on.
Nice video wwe
BOOOOORRRRRIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!
so how often had we the same thing going with orton and hhh?
Yeah I wouldn’t wanna see randy vs trips again  but Y’all think aj styles vs Triple H should happen?
One question? WHY?
The start of triple h’s promo sounded like his voice acting from the svr games
I love it
Randy got him good with the balls in the purse line lmao
Ah Christ this is literally Vince McMahon's in case of emergency break glass move.
Again? Boring
Interesting fact before Supershowdown Randy used the same insult to annoy Triple H
What
This came from out of nowhere I was expecting an NXT call up but this was awesome
2000 s ı like triple h 2010 s ı love triple h 2020 s still ı like and ı love his chrachter every show he's in very diffrent to me
If Randy doesn’t win I’ll be surprised
Why do everyone always add Stephanie into the fire
HHH And orton my people Despite all the economic crisis this is the right time to start up an investment
Oh Yes!! Triple H vs Randy Orton great match!!
Randy Orton is legitimately carrying raw these days
Dang.. that will do it lol
if there are no more legends to kill the only legend is the legend killer
Randy keeps talking bout steph
Let me guess. "Do you need your wife's permission?"   "Hiding behind your wife"   "That suit is just a symbol of you selling out"   "I'm.gonna ask Stephanie since she's the one who wears the pants and makes all the decisions "   Same tired promo EVERYONE uses against HHH. Get new writers. These ones are out of ideas.
He dont see you.
Wish HHH fight AJ
Triple H lost by Randy in their last match. Triple H wants the last word in every rivalry. I am sick of this
A sad song on hhh he is old now
Someone help me out please. Is Triple H still an executive in NXT or has he come back to Raw?
End this story now, I ain't gonna watch this garbage
Honestly I don't like what Randy did to does guys
Goddam what a right hand🤣
Has anyone said that raw and smack down sound like 2K
Triple H vs Randy Orton at WrestleMania 37!  Book it!
Getting cm punk vibes all over again
Fam dese two already fought flipping last yr what’s the point of Triple H coming out of retirement to lose when he can fight someone new like AJ
Kinda hope this leads to a Triple H related Firefly Funhouse match, that’ll be great that!
Laid OUT
This better be a personal storyline where have similar moments to when triple h invades randy’s house
"Oh are your balls in Stephanie's purse".  now where have I heard that before. Hmmmm
Wwe is so repetitive now 😂😂
I still remeber
the one that wears nwo wolfpack shirt looks like moxley(fan)
Who thinks they should have a match at the rumble all Mania
they used the line again ? Balls in Stephanie's Purse wow ok that was unexpected but i  guess  that,s the thing that Randy has to say to provoke Triple H lol
Uhhhh... this a rerun or sumn?
Are we slowly building to Ric Flair setting up a triple threat match between Evolution?
Nah That Hit Was Tooo Real
0:06 the one you should dont understand is WHY THE HELL GOLDBERG TOLD THAT IT WAS DREW MCINTYRE WHO *DISRESPECTED* THE LEGENDS 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🤦🏻‍♂️  Its Randy Orton, you Oldberg..
Please accept his offer triple h
Triple H King of Hell in a Cell WWF/ Ruthless Aggression   Randy Orton King of Hell in a Cell PG  Era
It would be a cool match and all but it’s the same issue with part timers all over agian
3:15 flash backs of the golden shovel
Orton vs Kratos: God of Raw 2K21
They need to put raw on the wwe network weekly
Let's see Randy kiss 💋  Stephanie again ! YEEAAHHH  !
Ah the man vs boy storyline with these to
Didn’t we last go through this at a Super Showdown not too long ago? 👎🏾
RANDY IS THE BEST HEEL RIGHT NOW❗💪🏽🔥🔥🔥
randy orton is a no good *legend*
The balls from the purse insult is a throwback to when Cm punk said it. or he said something along the lines of "you don't carry her purse but you wear her panties don't ya!?" or something like that
Amizing 😍😍😍😍 wow t H and Randy Orton even this day reminds me of when Randy Orton Faced With triple h  in the time of 2009 and Faced With triple h in the time of  2009 and 2004
so they pulled the "balls out of her purse"-line again...
The game is back
I want Randy meet in ring with  Brock lesnar
Because he's the freaking legend's killer ! Voilà
Randy the best wrestler ever
Idont get this storyline
love that randy orten brings old fights back
Here we go again....trying to stick it where it hurts..
Love Triple H but everytime i see him i expect him to say hes taken over WWE hahaa but in all serousness he shouldve got Goldberg to out over someone that needs it same with himself put himself or Goldberg in the Royal Rumble and let someone like Drew Gulak or someone kick your arse and put you out....but all respect to Triple H
I miss triple h long hair now he's just bald
Randy is the reason why I watch WWE
It's incridible for how much years we've seen these guys together.
What did hhh say
Triple H The Legend
Damn we got 2011 Orton vs 2014 Triple H😂😂😂
🔥
Ugh.
Triple H was the truth
What did HHH said to Orton at 1:10 seconds when it bleeped out saying: "Orton is a no good.."
This one is gonna be good
HHH 👍
I thought i wouldn't see this again after SuperShowdown.. What the hell took so long anyway? When Batista beat up Ric Flair Triple H wanted to kill Batista but he didn't do anything to Randy Orton after he beat up Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels
arguably the two best bad guys in WWE history
I want them to go 1 on 1 wrestlermainia I've been wanting this rivalry to happen again for years I'm so hyped
Wat about RKO and fiend
During this segment covid19 left the chat
one of the best rivalries in the wrestling world !
Kicking people in the head turns them from being cocky to humble.
I like this Randy...loving to fight...
Cant take this show seriously anymore with the digital crowd
Here we goo again
Face Triple H before in-ring retirement, yeah, that sounds good.
Bad television
Take this to mania!
3:14 randy orton used that exact same line on another show lmao
i hope randy beats hhh... hhh winning will have no sense..
These two’s rivalry will never get old
What he said in the beep??
Triple H is still jealous of Randy Orton success at this age,,,this old man can't get enough 😂😂😂
2004 I loved this rivalry
Is 2021 creative team be real
WWE censoring > AEW censoring
He already used the Stephanie and the purse line last time 😂😂😂
2009 Vibes!
That's funny how Randy said that about Hunter family jewels being in Steph purse, when last week Randy was called a bit©h by Alexa because he wouldn't set her on fire.
3:32 what ?
Lol Stephanie purse reference is bk
When did Kratos join WWE?
Hope drew gets well soon
Maybe it's the legends who are head butting Randy's foot, did you ever think about that? Okay! it is Randy's foot trying to detach the legends heads from their shoulders, but Raw set them up to be bullied by the killer for having a legends night. They know Randy's hates that night.
Balls from purses that's the similar line cm punk said to triple hhh
The ball purse joke again?
How is sami zyan snd bray wayyt watching from tunderdom 😂😂 ( like if u get the joke )
You know you can’t do what your buddy Shawn couldn’t do because Shawn was always better than you
Go WWE 🔥🔥🔥 we want this match at Royal rumble please 😫🔥
I don’t know who to stand by!!?? They’re both my favorite!!😭
here we go again, feel like dejavu, the balls conversation is the perfect way to taunt hhh
عجبا لكم لقد اجتمع الصقور وعزل القطيع. لماذا هذا الخوف من كورونا.😂😂
Ruthless aggression era kids your welcome
What did HHH say to him?
That may have been a Real, not pulled Punch.
Damn Randy took that balls out if her purse line from CM Punk 😂
Side note Randy's hoodie is dope but he looks funny asf in those shorts 😂
I love this new guy, HHH I think is his name. This other rising star Orton and him are facing off and everyone is so ready for it. Maybe one of them could even challenge the other new guy Goldber for the title he's sure to get
Well, there's your WM37 build started.
I heard this rumor the other day & I didn't believe it but here we are
Triple h and randy orton just brang me back nostalgia vibes from when I was a little kid in 2009 watching that
We’ve seen this about 700 times
2021: Triple H vs Rendy Orton
Hunter could feud with anyone. He could help elevate absolutely anyone. Why Randy Orton? We've seen this thousands of times...
The guy from the thunderdome look like bray wyatt
One legend Randy won't be able to put on the shelf
👃👃💚💣💚💛💛💣💣🛍💣💣💣💛💣👙🩱💛💛🛍💛💛💛💣👃💣💚💛💣👃💣💣💣👃💛💣💛👃💛💛👝💣💣👃👃💛💚💚👃💣💛💛💛💣🛍💛💣💣🛍🛍💛💛💣
“The God of War” Triplllllllllllllle H!
Is there even a superstar left who has the talent randy has? He’s basically triple h from the early 2000s. But at least H had talent like undertaker or angle or many of the great talents of that time. Now we have 2 (ok) champions. I don’t see Roman or Drew being able to beat Randy. Which is ok since wwe doesn’t need to push The legend killer. I just how sad it is for Orton to be on the top of the mountain with no one to actually get him off. He doesn’t need to be a champion to be the best the company has. It’s actually really sad as a long time viewer.
Dam they finally did a good rival maybe a match at wrestlemainia 37
I want Triple H as Kratos when a movie comes about God of war
Mentioning Stephanie having his balls is like Marty Mc fly being called a chicken
So is Royal Rumble just going to be legends vs Professional Wrestlers like Goldberg vs Drew Mcintyre Triple H vs Randy Orton
Randy Orton in 2021: "I am at my peak!"  Randy Orton in 2009: Hold my RKO
A no good what? There was some random beep...
God of War
They awfully close, I bet one gets covid.
I was wondering why HHH didn't say anything when Randy punt kicked Flair
Man again lol 😂 how many times are these guys gonna go at it in the ring ? This has been going on for years lol
The audio sounds like it was from 2k20
ohhhhhh rannnddddyyyyy with that punch line..... letsssss goooooo
Literally in 2009 all over again YES WE NEED IT 🔥
Isn't HHH the one who made Randy the Legend Killer, to begin with? lol
Hhh same story every year
Triple H vs Orton
When are all you guys gonna cut back on that time wasting microphone talking and start getting on with  some action???   i give you two chumps each a chair shot til you dont get up.
You couldn't retrieve your balls from her purse   Bruuuu
Who can remember the rivalry back in 2004
YOU WANNA FIGHT ME😩 YEA I WANNA FIGHT YOU😩 KISSES😋 AYOOOOOOO
Side burn Orton is back !
“Someone said to me once, 'Time is a flat circle.' Whatever we did or will do, i'll do it over and over again.”
How to make HHH accept a fight: - Say “Stephanie isn’t here...” Works like a charm!
jesus. Orton desperately trying to get Legends to fight him week in and week out starts to look very pathetic.
THE KING OF KINGS BACK WITH THAT HARD PUNCH 🤯🤯🤯👊👊👊👌👌👌👑👑👑😎😎😎👍👍👍
Cm Punk used that same line on Triple H during the Pipe Bomb angle to provoke Triple H
What if I told you back in 2005 that this feud would carry on into 2021 😂
The fans in the background look ridiculous lol
How many times Randy gonna resort to the "ask Stephanie for permission \ she has your balls" bars???? 😪😴
Imagine orton punt kicking triple H
Dude HHH last wrestled in 2019
No .  Triple H too ?  But the Match idea is nice .
"d'OOOHH"
Randy Orton Aaron TripleH Rob Doyle
HHH looking like Kratos at the end there. 🧐👀
Randy vs goldberg in a 16 minutes match would be awesome
Me parece o triple h se achicó xd?
I dont want to see this match again!!!!
Why is triple h talking about how hes  embarrassing legends. Hes the LEGEND KILLER!!!
Holy shoot
Never seen the game backing off from a challenge
He's been the "Legend Killer"....Rick was when he seen the light 🤔🤣😂
I love triple h    he's my favourite wresteler   but i dont saw him in the Ring for long time
Yes Triple h fight in 2021
I don't understand why you buried CM Punk in 2011 and it doesn't benefit you Triple H 🐸
Triple H's retirment match against Randy Orton? I am in to it.
Randy Orton, don't EVER talk about a man's wife, remember what happened back in Houston, Texas? Wrestlemania 25 at the  Reliant Stadium Triple H beat the living hell out of you for attacking his wife Stephanie and you deserve every beating
Lmao, no probs to Christian because he was more over then wwe wanted him to be lol
Randy has no respect for anyone except the paycheck.
They censored brat? LMFAO If you're trying to make us think he said a curse word at least have the camera behind Triple H's head. I read lips, he says BRAT lmaoooooooo
Back in 09 GREATESR RIVALRY ALL TIME
These two were A MAJOR part of my childhood
Watch the profanity
They Should Renew This Rivalry For the Royal Rumble Triple H vs Randy Orton
Anyone know what Triple H called Randy? "A no good....???"
Stealing/repeating CM Punk's balls in the purse joke from 2011 i see
They minus Mark made their bed
Randy Orton will be the best legend in the future. He is just an unorthodox person. He can make any storyline way better than the rest. "The legend killer's" legend will be legendary.
Cant wait to see triple h back in the ring .. always a fan of triple h 👍🏻🤘🏼
At this rate it’s gonna be Goldberg vs HHH for the title at wrestlemania. If this was the early 2000s I’d be freaking out
1:22 What Is Rusev Doin In The Thunderdome
No good WHAT?!!!
Dumb
RKingofkingsO
Randy is jarkass?
WWE just can't help themselves can they?
We really have to see this feud again. So many times they fought. Triple H just won't retire lol
Triple h is still gorgeous
Triple H vs Orton at wrestle mainia for HHH retirement Match and hes the legned killer killer ?
What a joke
He will fight again
Throw in Batista...because...f it...
This is the new normal  THANK GOD WE DONT HAVE DIAL UP!
If this was real, Mark Henry or the Big Show would demolish Randy Boredom.
What did Triple H say that was censored?
Ohh great it's the WWE version of Brady vs Brees
Hand over your hand, Trouble H, for That  I hit Orton to learn literature, Mayit again
I thought the punt kick was banned not anymore was it Vicky that banned that movie because he put dusty roads in the hospital im not sure
Bringing back attitude era wrestlers again for the 50th time🤦‍♂️, I guess you gotta do what you gotta do 🤷‍♂️
Wrestlemania 37, Randy Orton vs Triple H, carrer ending match🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like a setup for a Triple H retirement match, well if thats the case it should have been Seth imo
Again?
He doesn't understand why Orton kicked someone in the head......... Does HHH remember attacking Flair and ramming HBK's head into a car window ? Etc ?! lol
Now I’m always for them 2 in the ring but it’s sad all this talent & this was the highlight of the show
Wwe its borring AEW is the future
No good what?
didnt we already see this exact thing a few years back? vince is getting senile dementia?
the game fight match
I personally want this match. I Think it will be an I quit wwe match and Orton wins. He is only 40
ITS ALL IN THE GAME
So he wipes his snotty nose then   touches randy that covid safe🤔
Why is it when these two get together in the ring you just know it's going to lead to one hell of a match/fight
TRIPLE H OR RANDY ORTON??
My god has Triple H aged.
That was actually a good promo which isnt saying much because good promo's are far and few between in the WWE these days and the few that are good all seem to involve Randy Orton.
Randy took it personal with many people like Edge, Triple H and mostly John Cena
It's back to Orton vs HHH from 2009
Respect to Orton and HHH, but it's sad to see that in 2021 a Ruthless Aggression stars have to carry the show. And it shows that Vince can no longer make new stars
Possible matches for WrestleMania 37 Universal title match: Roman Reigns Vs Drew Mcintyre, Drew wins. WWE title match: Goldberg Vs Randy Orton, Orton wins.

Tell him Triple H
Ligma balls
How many more matches are these 2 gonna fight in
such an UNDERRATED rivalry back in the 2000s & 2010s. they REALLY WENT AT IT, and i MISS TF out of it....
So Triple H really does not like it when you beat up Ric Flair.
I remember when randy give rko to stephanie and kiss stephanie in front of triple H, thats so crazy storyline
Interesting
R. K. O
Here we go again.
I hope this isn't like 2004 where we get a bad face turn from Orton
Man people pull that stephanie card so often HHH should be imune to it now
They had the most viewed video in WWE's Youtube channel. 🤔
I am a huge Orton fan, and I love him. But I don’t like it when he humiliated all those legend. I want him to be the Randy everybody wants to cheer for.
Randy Orton is a perfect heel
Again? Nahh
I feel like Randy Orton watches Cobra Kai cuz his promos lately remind me of Kreese. A viper and cobra are both snakes after all.
Evolution members facing each other.  HHH vs Orton HAS to better than  HHH vs Undertaker at Melbourne.
déjà vu
Will the game rise again face againts the legend killer haha
What did HHH call Orten when they censured it?
what triple h said ?
So... Randy is just you? Lol
@3:11 😂🤣💀
The only thing that can make Trips fight is to provoke him with his balls in Steph's' purse, The Rock did, and now Orton
This feud was since the separation of evolution
HHH has never cut a bad promo throughout his whole career as The Game
3 states of hell match at hell in a cell was good
If Triple H retires soon his farewell match should be against Randy Orton.
I remember SuperShowDown, HHH vs. Randy Orton last time ever
Triple H has to get permission to retrieve his balls from Stephanie's purse here we go again I'm on the floor dying of laughter thanks😯😅😂😂😂😂😂
Randy carrying raw on his back these days
This promo reminds me 2009 These men are legend
No good what?
Decked him in da snoozee
@3:33 that's the noise I make when I catch myself in my zipper
The first time I got into WWE was when Orton left Evolution. This is nostalgia at its finest.
randy said the same thing from 2 years ago. DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN
Legend killer 🔥
Balls in the purse gets HHH every time
Jinder Mahal in the background?
What's with the Just For Men Orton? You were rocking the salt and pepper look. Let the grey flyyyy.
This brings back memories when randy kissed stephanie
Randy:Stephanie  love me Triple H: Fxxk u ...
Wm37 bout incoming🤦‍♂️
Burn in my light theme back? 🤔 That would be EPIC!!
Triple h is fake personalty
*The roasts are*  🔥👌
Wwe just feels like a rehearsal videos
Randy orton is always been my favorite
Randy will get destroyed
Triple H always burying up and coming talent like Randy Orton. Orton is a futur hall of famer
قيل للسّعآدة .. كيف تأتين ؟!قآلت .. آتي حين تعلم كلّ نفسٍ أن لن يصيبها إلا ما كتب الله لـٍهآ؛؛؛؛؛؛؛؛؛؛؛؛
oh so Orton vs HHH for the 1000000000000th time
Triple H has been provoked by the same line for like 8 years now
Thirple H :you are not a legend killer Randy Orton:yes,I am not a legend killer, I am now simply an legend
Triple h is underrated on the mic just as good as rock and stone cold
Who remembers hhh broke randy Orton house
Triple H has done far worse numerous times and we're supposed to pretend he hasn't.
Is that Rusev wearing the raw shirt? 😂 1:19
Randy Orton is the best HEEL on this show
Yeah man don’t ever Disrespect Ric Flair, he’s a real life wrestling legend
I haven't liked a lot of segments lately, but this one, as well as a few others last few weeks are actually impressive 💯
I cant see the video
Last time a guy said that to me what happen your wife took your balls are you lost your fighting spirit it took 15 guys to hold me back no mistake I’m 195 pounds
Lol he forgot Christian.
Feels like 2009 again 🔥🔥
2005-2021 HHH vs ORTON
Legendary promo by both 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Randy Orton vs Bray Wyatt at Royal Rumble (2021).
What did he say that it was beeped out
Fiend comes and attacks orton at the Royal Rumble
This is the best Randy Orton I have seen in the last two decades.
Greatest rivalry forever for me as per stories 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The Game Vs The Viper Both are like same Mentor vs Student
1:08 Triple H calls Randy Orton N-Word in 2021
I'm Surprised Triple H Would Actually Fight😉
I love both these guys but I do not want to see another HHH Orton Fued, Orton is to good to be in a Feud with someone with the Age of HHH.
But yet Goldberg goes after drew for what randy did 🤷‍♂️? Tf how does that work
I love the WWE pushing their young talent!!!
I like when wrestlers insult hhh regarding Stephanie because it's most likely true and it's funny as hell 😂
Booooooring
Omg I miss this rival ruthless Era Orton vs attitudes Era triple h
Man this stuff is unwatchable. Just my opinion I can’t do it. I can’t wait for the crowds to come back
Look at how short triple h is. Hes struggling to be 6’1.
Didn't Randy make that purse joke the last time they went against each other?
kratos😎
Um...Mr. helmsley sir...this is PG...
Every time the "balls in  purse" line does the trick for Randy
Orton kissing Stephanie while crawling around the ring is the most polorizing moment in wwe to me...
Y’all talking about their ‘09 feud, what about their feud after Summerslam 04 going into Royal Rumble 05? GOOD times.
Not again zzzzz
This should have been done last week with Goldberg. It would have made more sense.
the most destrctive group in wwe is like and old rivaly back in 2009
I'm having flash backs
They do this every couple of years these two ...   Man Tripple H is getting Old 🥺
y tho
Randy is nothing but a no good.. What?
Why Triple h  conforts Randy Orton? We already see it a lot of times. I just wanna see the feud between Drew McIntyre and Triple h. It can be awesome.
Could be setting up a Randy Orton vs Triple H  match at Wrestlemania
The balls in steph purse might as well be a compliment by now
the croud affects
orton against triple h again? did i transport back to 2009?
Finally My hero HHH here!!! just wait randy
I want HHH vs Cody Rhodes
Two of the greatest wrestlers of all time
Triple H vs Randy Orton at Wrestlemania. Last Triple H match. One more time.
The game is here! I missed him so much!
Not the first time Randy had used the balls line with him lol
First, Dave. Now, Randy? How many Ruthless Aggression guys has Hunter ticked off?
These guys had the best feud back in the day man the memories are coming back
Triple H is back in the ring 👍🙏wellcome back to WWE 🙏
Triple H is going to tear apart Randy Orton for bringing up Stephanie McMahon
triple h i dont understand the things you do to the legend ITS NOT LIKE HE'S CALLED THE LEGEND KILLER
Looks like Randy isn't taking days off... He's on to his next victim
they deadass censored brat im dead
The audio is too loud
Hhh betrayed orton freaking 17 years ago.... how is it that long?????
Triple H created this monster  Now he must put him down
What i miss raw and now were having hhh the game feuding with the apex predator randy? wth
Randy orton has been at his peak prime for the past 15 yrs
Randy’s built different
They both beat eachothers but this time Orton needs to win because hhh ain’t full time wrestling no more
Triple H Never Disappoints!!💯 The Damn GOAT 💯🐐
How many times have they recycled that line about Trip’s balls being in Stephanie’s purse??
About time The King of Kings came back
Who remembers when triple h was handcuffed and he watched randy kiss Stephanie?
😂 old but funny randy orton the legend killer wich that he is 💀
Randy orton Randy orton
Did randy just say he's in his prime 🤔
RKO RKO RKO
Looks like randy went bit to far on triple h
What did triple h say? When it beeped
The balls in Stephanie’s purse is always the go to when trying to bait Triple H to a fight. Please come up with better material I’m sure if Triple H had a dollar for every time he’s heard that line he’d be just as rich as his father in law lol.
Special delivery for Randy
So the Fiend is done with Randy? I thought he never forgets?
OMG! HHH IS BACK ON THE RING!!! 😍
Why has and still, does wwe post punk just feel like punk arc rip offs. Like when a lead leaves from a show or a band and they they try to replace that member and act like nothing happened. But clearly something did. Clearly this isnt punk
Why censored? Its not even a bad word RIP WWE
wwe is going BACKWARDS not again hhh just won't Retire😃
Triples h voice is deep as hell and sounds very intimidating as hell
Yep there gonna have a match
They always go there lol 😂😂
I feel like every time they have a match together he uses the balls and Stephanie's purse promo every single time
Already did this and used the same script 🙄
Its funny that wwe is not able to build sb like hhh or shawn up today
Played right n to his hand Trips
“You were unable to retrieve your balls from her purse” a callback to the build up of their super showdown match
Have them feud. Give them a match at Mania no holds barred, Fiend interferes and costs Orton the match.
Triple H vs randy orton..fight right now..gogogo😈
Ever since Triple H went bald he hasn’t been the same triple H with long hair
Nice seeing younger talent get pushed.
Everyone from evolution trying to challenge triple h 😂
they should do this match and if HHH wins then orton retires..
That match must happens at Wrestlemania for the HHH retirement as a wrestler
They are recycling cm punks pipe bombs.
I bet that felt good for for triple h lol 😆😆
WRESTLEMANIA 2021: TRIPLE H vs RANDY ORTON
Do they not remember that he's the legend killer???
people never say as I think of the goodness of jesus all that he has done for me my soul cry out hallelujah thank God for saving me
Yoo this gave me chills frfr 😳
Whenever i see both of them, Randy kissing Steph comes to my mind😅
Randy should've brought up when he kissed stephanie
Damn it’s never get old seeing triple h on the mic  But what did h said that they have to *** ?
Road to Wrestlemania 37!
Maybe Randy can dish an unused roast next time.
Wow 2020 threw one last curb ball, another boring hhh and orton feud. So im guessing triple h wants to bury orton too.
does anyone else find the room reverb on his voice, on top of the crowd seem just a bit off?
They almost kiss each other
Feels like a rerun from what happened in 2019
My answer is no. Dean ambrose returns... ‘’ Oh what’s the matter,? Do you have to ask for permission from your father-in-law first?’’
Knew it
I love how Orton brought the balls in Stephanies purse back
Triple H could play the god of war KRATOS
The Viper and The Game. The greatest Rivalry from 2009. So much nostalgia.
Cant wait for the promos
He really hit HHH with the same line from the promo in the saudi Arabia buildup the balls in the purse wwe u ain't slick
Evolution is a mystery...
triple h is a washup
Look at these two fighting like two old drunks in a discount liquor store line on New Year's Eve
nothing says building young stars than triple h and goldberg........
😲😲😲😲😲
HHH for Kratos in the God of War movie
Triple h old
Yeah, HHH left the balls in his wife's purse! Freaking sucker punch like a Stephanie slap XDXDXD Sickening thought that anyone would cheer for The Authority & The Fiend
Stop with the damn "beep" already 🤷🏻‍♂️ and randy is carrying raw amazingly 🔥🔥🔥
Orton vs h at royal rumble
"A legend like... Big Show" what? Since when is Big Show a legend? A legend of face/heel turns, maybe but JAJA a legend? Nah.
Randy Orton's deserve a  good pushed in the month by triple H
Sooo good 👏
Batista Returns on my Channel!
Flashback To CM Punk Saying HHH Balls In Stephs Bag
👊🤚
How boring. That's the insult EVERYONE uses to goad Triple H into a fight. Can no one seriously think up anything else?
Randy is at his best when he's facing executive.
I think triple H.vs randy Orton will be a really good 1 on 1 match up in 2021!!!
We've seen this like 373748483 times
Tell me why these dudes feudin again? What all becasue randy disrespected Ric flair?!?!? I think maybe Goldberg got his script mixed up with triple h’s and came out and said it against drew
Not sure what's up with triple hs voice here.. sick? Or too much stress from wwe sinking. Doesn't sound like him or like usual in his lower toned speaking voice. 🤔😔
One more match
Really nice 👌 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Damn, Hunter sounds old ... from his last promo to this one, you can tell. 😭
There was a time when Triple H did all that of course. But now if anyone insults his DX/Evolution pals no way. And Orton loves playing the balls in Stephanie's purse trick. Works everytime. it's Wrestlemania season and I'm long overdued for a Triple H match and some new merchandise.
Who remembers Randy Orton vs. Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship at *WWE NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2011* & *WWE HELL IN A CELL 2011?*
We need Like Randy Orton Vs Triple H At Wrestlemania
Is that fake cheering?
How many times has someone insulted Triple H saying his balls are in Stephanie's purse. Seriously. Writers or Vince can't come up with anything else. Super lame.
Well at least Triple H doesn't come back to face Goldberg or not I'll be so piss lol
15/16 years ago: Royal Rumble 2005🔥😎 15/16 years later: Monday Night RAW🔥😎
I miss These days of Wwe Where these two were actually Feuding back in 2009
before triple h was much stronger than Orton
Biff: What's wrong McFly chicken 🐔...? Marty:Nobody calls me chicken 🐔
Trips can still cut a promo   “Live by the sword, die by the sword” part I liked a lot
This is gonna be awesome🔥🔥🔥🔥
A no good what?🤣
Orton is Blin🔥d now can’t wait to see The Fiend Return
Dammm
Man the swerve this took tonight blew me away.... from last week to this segment I forgot Randy was beefin with The Fiend. But this was put together brilliantly
2:16 Lol if only Snake Gaiden or TheFizio were still making YTPs. 👅
Shades of cm punk lol @3:15
Can Triple H still grow hair? Or is his bald head only for his business side?
Fighters fight (in Rocky Balboa voice)
Only watching raw because of randy Orton, drew macntyre is trash
3:12 was the greatest line in my life .😭
What are the original WWE settings?
Randy orton angry kick triple H Head long long year’s 2009
Wtf is this lmaooo
He said he doesn’t understand like he didn’t do this in 2009😂😂
Kratos mad
YOU PPL ARE IDIOTS 😊03:33 - Homer Simpson commentates for 1 second😂😂😂😂🍺🍺DOH
Randy Orton vs Triple H vs Edge vs John Cena. most world champion’s in one match at Wrestlemania would be great.
Yawn boring boring boring like a pair of middle age men far surpassed their prime talking up a match its 2021 not the late 90s lol
Alexa Bliss actually threw a fireball at Randy. I guess she's a supernatural witch.
This is just class man😍😍😍
Fn coward snake stuck in a corner
Randy orton 2009 kick because randy orton angry
Good who?  MoFu?
The game returns
Why (to me) does Triple H sound like Bruce Wayne/Batman
Their rivalry over the years was LEGENDARY.
Hhh on improves raw a little bit
Another match
I'm on my peak, I'm on my peak eh, I'm a king, champion Booker T 👑
3:33 Do’ h😂
Boy, WWE Is Always Playing The Hits, Isn’t It? Good The First Couple Of Times, But Now...C’mon..
Didn’t this same thing literally happen like a year or 2 ago when they face each other at super showdown.
Zzz 😴
Triple H vs A.J. Styles would slap
2009 flashbacks
ahh yess swearing the good ole wwe lol
didnt they already have their "last fight" like last year. WWE runnin outta ideas
Great. I'll be surprised if Triple H didn't bust his pectoral muscles again.  Seriously, first Goldberg and now this? Keep risking old timers' health for money and nostalgia is not what's best for business. Look at how that works out in Crown Jewel and Super Showdown.
Why are everyone talking about triple h balls when they trash talk him
3:10 Raw June 3, 2019 Same Recycled joke
Who remember Jan 11 2021 when Randy Orton wants Triple H to meet him in the ring
So wwe doesn't have any worthy opponents for Orton anymore that they have to rely on H to fill the void?
He used that "unable to receive your balls from her purse" the last time they feuded
RKO
1:33 i thought the one with the red shirt is Batista, lmao
Randy Orton is the best
WWE is completely lost for ideas. Wasn’t this a joke feud going into crown jewel the other year? Come up with something new ya gronks
Alguem brasileiro kkkkkkkkkklk
WWE should be grateful for Randy having a strong back, cause if there's anyone that's on the Raw roster that's been caring the show with it's storylines more so than anybody else, especially through this pandemic, it's legend killer, not to mention how he's been brushing his teeth with the mic. No offense to Drew, well maybe, cause again why is he the champion, and Randy's not WWE? It's been the RKO show.
by the end of their respected careers, John be a vs randy Orrin and triple h as ref
Completely awesome
So the fiend's feud over? Sucks!! Sister Abigail vs Legend killer is awesome
I’m ALWAYS into Orton/Triple H feuds
Randy:Is it just Stephanie your wife isn't here tonight you are unable to retrieve your balls from her purse Hunter:IMMA PUT SOME DIRT IN UR EYE
Randy should do a Crossface ‼️
Bro that’s literally the same Same same promo they did when they fought at Saudi Arabia
Orton sets a fellow wrestler on fire but keeps his job. 🔥🔥
Randy said to to Hunter in there promo for there Saudi match
I think they will both be in the rumble and one of them will eliminate the other causing a match at wrestlemania
Their rivalry amazing in 2009
i like that hunter became a protector of legends
😍
Triple h  randy Orton's 👍👍👍
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY GOLDBERG IS BACK
Balls in Stephanie's purse is such a good joke
He almost broke the game again 😂
Enjoy
Orton retires HHH
Randy has literally used that balls in Stephanie's purse line on trips at least twice now an literally as he was exciting the ring in the same way lol
HHH was a last minute insert coz Drew caught Covid.
Triple H is so good.
2 Years ago, The Stephanie-Joke was funny.  Now..not so much
Wow they keep bringing back the old dogs. Get some new material. Boring
they should really cast triple h as kratos
Triple h always waits for WrestleMania to make a script.
I wanna se a triple threat mate Randy v Triple H v Batista
Love to see this triple h
How to get a match with triple H  Insult him by saying he left his balls in Stephs purse
Looks like an Dejavu segment.. That Balls and purse thingy😂
That looked like an actual punch to me
I hope this won't get a Weasel Randy Orton threatens to sue WWE for him being attacked by an official  Storyline. Because that would be boring.
Legend killer
It was time for hhh to stepped up to Randy Orton
But at points this was line for line a rehash of prior feuds. They did have to scramble...so...
I love Triple H and Randy have one final match at Wrestlemania
Cheap shotted him because he knew he would lose in a full on fight
Damn, they were this desperate for ratings that they gotta rehash old feuds.
Shades of CM Punk
"Randy...the truth is I need my knees" - Triphe H
two legends
Who else remembers HHH as a skinny former self with long locks of blond giving a pedigree to the Ultimate Warrior and then getting smashed?
Didn't Triple H literally screw everyone over to keep the title back in 2004-ish? Not sure how he can preach from any sort of pedestal.
Randy want to Kiss Stephanie again
*so is the preview of wm37?*
Dam
Triple h vs randy orton 2021 royal rumble
1:11 Did he say brat? 🤔
N wwe
Nanana nananana nanana nananana hey hey hey hhh nanana nanana nanana hey hey  hey good bye nanananana nanana nana hey hey hey good bye
In Randy's defense, Its not like the legends don't know he slithers among them when they show up on raw, and how he only finds joy in punting their heads off,.Randy nothing more and always will be a Venomous Legend Serial Killer, whom they don't want to make coil.
wwe, your program is a joke.
Randy Orton: and your unable to retrieve your *BALLS* from her purse  Fake Audience Audio: OHHHHHH
Who want see CM Punk Vs the game HHH
They’re always roasting Hunter with  Stephanie
3:10 My jaw drop 😆
BEST HEEL OF ALL TIME. NOT AN OPINION ANYMORE. FACT
Fellow Evolution member doesn't under WHY he's a legend killer   Hmmmm!
the most wwe segment ever
GG.
Triple h haven't been in the ring since supershow down seeing him and orton go it at will be a rematch 😎😎
Didn't he use this on the Authority in like 2014/2015???
Hey im early
Why is this going to happen, again?
DAMNNN HE MIGHT END TRIPLE H
A 17 year long feud
Triple h - kratos Randy Orton -baldur
Triple H not able to retrieve his balls from Steph’s purse. That has never been said before 🤣
Push.  New.  Guys.
he said the same punchline about the balls in Stephanie's purse? seriously? WWE booking needs some work.
The Legend Killer-🔥🔥🔥
Imagine if they made these angles back when there were people in the audience instead of putting the same old boring shows.
👀
Just saying hhh hasn’t fought since randy beat him in Saudi
the classic "stephanie isnt here" roast   works everytime
341th and i managed to get in the thunder dome 😎
orton gonna ends triple h
Isn't Triple H the same person who battered and beat Ric Flair with a sledgehammer?
Triple and Orton promo raw 2003 Orton joins evolution
No good what?
his prime was 2010-2017
They gotta bring in hunter just so people can watch this lol
I miss the Evolution
That is good idea I want edge too on the ring and challenge on the legend killers challenge match
Randy orton is more dangerous than ever
After the champ get covid. This should make up for it
Man this build up to super showdown 2019 is geting good 😉
Randy should do a Crossface ‼️
HHH and Randy will be wrestling each other when they’re 80
Guess they are who wants triple H to win   Like : triple h  Comment randy orton
Randy orton vs Batista 2014 Batista vs triple h 2019  Randy orton vs triple 2021
This Promo was pure gold
what did HHH say that censored?
We got Kratos vs Orton like the good old times
The "get your balls from Stephanie " line was used by Randy the last time they wrestled...lol. They couldn't of thought of something else? Ohhh WWE ... AEW is catching up
Randy should do a Crossface ‼️
Why does everyone have to mention triple h’s wife saying that she has his balls somewhere
Man, people gotta stop talking about Triple H's balls like that. It never works out
Randy Orton stared down half of the legends but not Triple H mannn!!!!
No matter when or how. Randy Orton VS Triple H is always🔥🔥!! One of my favorite Rivalry's in WWE!!!
What did hhh say that was bleeped? I couldn’t read his lips
HHH: I don't understand why you kick people in the head...... Legends.....  " Gee I don't know maybe he's a heel and has been kicking people in the head for years lmao 😂 WWE must really think we are stupid
Alexa bliss is like she ate a fire flower and then shoots a fireball
Are we in 2008 or 2021 ? Why wwe can’t build new stars ? We don’t need to see legends in 2021 to take spotlights from the new talents
Ohh I hope randy Orton fights triple H
Yes bring the game back, he didn’t wrestle in 2020❤️
At this point any promo would between them is going to be way better than any match they could have now.
Rko! Rko!Rko!..Its wrong if you live in 🔫 gun you will die in gun its in the bible written👈🐣👍🇺🇸🗽🎶🎶🎶
It’s about to go down
This is  Wrestlemania worty!!!
Triple h: the game, the cerebral assassins, the king of kings  Randy Orton: the legends killers, the viper
I hope legends should be around the Ring to make sure Randy doesn't run away
This smell WrestleMania Match
Triple H: How many times do I have to teach you this lesson, young man?!
We literally had this same exact segment before super showdown 2019
Wrastlemania setup
stop bleeping out cuss words it ruins it lmao
WHY
Batista : Hey Randy can I ask u a question ?
What is the censured word that HHH said? Sorry I'm don't speak english '-
Imagine next week batista spears randy in the ring
Hhh with the sucker punch... Hope RKO punts him
Same insult as 2019
Wut did he sayy
HHH vs. Orton for the 1234567890th time.... Take my money!!! 💰💵💸🤑
Ppl use that same line against triple h almost as much as ppl use the “burying” thing with John Cena
Randy said the thing about Stephanies purse in another feud anyone else remember that feud
Randy vs Triple h I was so hipe
This kinda makes me think that HHH is gonna have his retirement match at mania vs orton
As much as Randy deserved being hit.   A CEO can not strike a employee for any reason.          $1 fine plus a 30min Zoom Lego build with your son.
HHH
The best feud of the modern era
I swear they always use the insult about triple he’s balls being in stephs purse
*QUICK!* Someone tell Samantha to get the door!!!!
did randy reuse a punk line
I cant believe Orton went there with the "triple hs balls being in stephanies purse" comment. He is basically quoting cm punk.
AEW is way more better and exciting than WWE.
That CM Punk Reference Ouch Randy That Stung Even For Me
Honestly, I agree everything that HHH say to Orton.  Cause it's sad that despite being a legend himself, he's still disrespect the legends.  And add the insult to injury, he no longer have the right to call himself the legend yet he's hypocritically claim that he's the legend in both of his own time and HHH's time.  I mean what did I expect from The Legend Killer anyway?💁🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
I've been waiting for this!! I wish they showed this last week at legends night
Triple H looks like that dude who played Evil Man in The Thundermans
That straight punch hit harder than the atomic bomb.
No offense but why is Triple H on RAW tonight again?
Randy Orton pulled a Cm Punk...lol
He.....will......return!!! The Fiend.....will Return Randy!!!!!
Randy is still the legend killer
They use that line all time whenever triple h is in the ring  oh Stephanie must have you’re balls in her purse
Triple H trying to be the good guy is like R Truth trying to legitimize the 24/7 title
Randy has used the balls in purse joke twice now
Evolution to Randy handcuffing HHH and kissing Stephanie to HHH making Randy the face of the company to Evolution reuniting these 2 have had quite a history
I saw this.👍👍
They had a lot of history between one of onther back at the past
The history of these 2 has been reignited!! And it was a fight
Something something balls purse something something same two dudes in the main event AGAIN
Bro where is the fiend..things are getting dull now sense him and alexia just vanished...
Hell in a cell at Wrestlemania, make for that Wrestlemania 25 match.
3:14 Vietnam flashbacks from June 2019.
BREAKING! We have confirmed its the 10000th time Randy has used this "joke" on Triple H 3:12
Triple H looks like Kratos or is it me?
andre to hogan  bret on the screw jod  now Randy on the legend humiliation
Would love to see those two at it again 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
orton with his mentor 🔥
12 years later....  WE NEED THIS MATCH
Did Randy just use the CM PUNK LINE ?! The “balls from her purse” reference 💀💀💀 oh naw
Triple h:" you wanna fight me"? Randy:" yhr I wanna fight you" !
Randy vs hhh 3 stages of hell was the best match I have seen out of both or Evolution vs the shield 2014 too 🎉🤩
Opponent: Triple HHH I challenge you to a match Triple HHH: No Opponent: How’s the wife? Triple HHH: Alright it’s personal you’re on Every Triple HHH feud ever
Who remember when Randy DDT Steph from the middle rope and kissed her in front of Triple H
Randy used that exact same balls joke last time too 😂😂
Not gonna lie Love to see Triple H again (I don’t watch NXT unfortunately)
Randy is a savage  But at the end he was blind after the show
If you want to get Triple H to accept a match, just insult his family and his manhood.
This was one of the best in the 20 years of Monday night raw
And this is why ratings are garbage for Raw hhh and Orton in 2021
Wow triple h’s balls in Stephanie’s purse, not like we haven’t heard that before
ahhh fireballs
I want Triple H and Randy Orton to face each other inside Hell in a Cell sometime. both of them and the undertaker are the three masters of that match. also I wish Triple H would grow his hair back long again. bald's not his look
You are unable to retrieve your balls from her purse😂
hey boys
What's good its been 8 minutes
nice
I'm tired with HHH vs Randy . Can we see some new star. ..🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Hello ??
I totally have stopped watching raw but I wish I would have seen this thank goodness for u tube I just wish there would have been a ending worth watching with the game and orton I don’t like the fiend or that brat.
HHH CAN JUST SWEAR any time he wants he owns the company
Twice now randys told triple h to retrieve his balls from Stephanie's purse 😂😂
Orton go SAVAGE again with HHH
He had to bring up Stephanie into their conversation 😂😂
This is the 2nd time Randy has made that purse roast and it’s still hilarious as the 1st time
They've used that line a few times. Lol!!
"I don't understand you kicking legends in the head"  On 2004 HHH was ok with that xD.
Ric Flair is the GOAT
Balls from her purse joke was already used when they built these two up for super showdown
The legends say this is what was meant to happen last week with Randy and Goldberg, but Goldie got lost and ended up in the ring with Drew.  Good on Trips for looking out for the elderly.
Randy said the same thing about Stephanie purse
Добавляйте субтитры на русском!!
I- Not again LMFAO
He said that 2years ago lol but this time he did not break character
Remember when Randy Orton had turned face by turning on Triple H & the rest of the Authority back in 2014
Randy is just getting good story lines ☺️ and he surely proves that he's worth them
🤣🤣🔥
Triple H and Randy Orton had one of the best rivalries ever that’s why they’re both legends
very nice video hey boy
THE VIPER new wwe champion in wrestlemania 37
RANDY ORTON BEST WRESTLER IN THE WORLD
orton vs hhh wrestlemania?
He brought back the Balls in her purse line 😂😂😂
Who misses lana
I love it when HHH and Randy Orton have a feud against each other
Mr HHH👑 is So Good 2 See You
BRING BACK CM PUNK  and your ratings will increase thousand times
Triple H was furious to Randy Orton in 0:01, because he caused several WWE Legendary wrestlers injured in 0:20, including "Bray Wyatt The Fiend" suffered with his skin burns since TLC. 0:30. 😡. He disrespecting him about Stephanie McMahon in 2:59, and that's what he get. 3:32.
Randy Orton will always be heel , Triple H.  is 💯 as heel.
Just kiss already
Randy ❤️
Triple H and Randy Orton has done unspeakable horrible things to each other for over 20 yrs.
Randy Orton and Triple H have a lot of history together.
I still remember their last man standing match at no mercy one of the greatest match of all time
Randy orton be careful what you wished for when you want the game
Retrieve your balls from Stephanie's Purse. I knew he would bring that up
QUE RAYOS FUE LO QUE PASOOOO!!!?
even me here.. I don't understand what they are talking  but I'm just enjoying watching WWE
Overrated Roman Reigns has only 1% of Randy Orton & Triple H mic skills combine
Attacked ric flair  Attacked Triple H Batista next?
Randy Orton retires Triple H in Wrestlemania. Evolution retiring each other, that would be awesome.
Randy Orton vs HHH WM 37
Covid-19 is fraud. None of the tests are even looking for any kind of virus at all. Especially not a covid-19. All the tests are doing is they are looking for things that may or may not be there if there maybe was a virus present (not specifically covid-19) but those things may or may not be there for a variety of other reasons too. One of those reasons being if you've ever had a flu shot. There is no true covid-19 test because there is no covid-19. Nobody has ever been legitimately or honestly diagnosed with covid-19.
Why does WWE always decide to write Raw at the last second ? Like they've got the WHOLE week. But they finalise on the day of the show. And yes I wish our WWE champion the speedy recovery.
The rivalry of Triple H vs Randy Orton was awesome back in 2009
This rivalry is legendary
Triple H and Randy Orton had a long rivalry against each other.
Randy Orton is the real face of this company.. NOT Overrated Roman Reigns.. Randy Orton is absolutely a LEGEND
Who remembers back in 2009 where Triple H invaded Orton’s house?
what year are we in ?!
Their rivalry was amazing in 2009.
Titus worldwide 🌎
hbk and orton great
Orton has used that purse line before with HHH.
Epic
Keep Triple H on RAW every week. That will get people invested in RAW.
HHH cuts a better promo than 95% of the roster
YO IM EARLY
This segment thousand times more entertaining than Overrated Roman Reigns whole career  FACTS !!!!!!!
2019: Batista attacks Ric Flair  2020: Randy Orton attacks Ric Flair  2021 : Maybe 🤔 Triple H
1st
HHH still in great shape.
Poop
Anyone gonna talk about the fact that Alexa is now a fire bender
Anyone realize how raw was made so weirdly, it was because they were late on schedule
I WWE is awesome to Watch
This 2009 Feud Is Epic. This Feud Is Still Going On Until 2021. WOW....
First
Cool
Omg
I am the Pakistani WWE champion of the world
Sometimes Randy Orton can be savage on the mic these two have great rivalries
I’m early
