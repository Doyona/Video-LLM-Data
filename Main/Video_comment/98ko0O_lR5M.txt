Hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaa. One of the most satisfying wins in mma!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂
Bruh. Chito is so much better then Sean. Sean sucks, he fights the weakest guys . MARLON IS THE NEXT CHAMPION. !!!!!!!
Hahahah chito is such a joke 🤣 😂  he says he checked the leg kick lmfao this guy kicked Sean and his toe fucked up Sean's leg... a win is a win and we can't take that away from him but this not something to be proud of as if u knocked him out
"Ecuador hijueputa" JAJAJAJAJA
Omalley is 14-1, he is still a phenomenal fighter
Sean didn't lose he simply failed to win
Ecuador 🇪🇨!!!!!

Chito by immigrant mentality
Next stop for the Chito train is in Las Vegas Dec 19 , 2020 where he will TKO Aldo . All Aboard !
Came in a fan of O’Malley now I’m a fan of Chito!
I’d like to see them run it back. If chito wins again he will own omalley.  If O’Malley wins they will have a trilogy.
Need some milk
I just want him so badly to say "Ma nam Jeff"
🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨WE LOVE CHITO  💪
Gettt emm boyyy
7 straight
Way to represent Chito 💪🇪🇨
DUDE,,, this is so funny, "don't be a bitch and conquer your inner bitch, all those fu3kin things Joe"
Sean shouldn’t be losing to this guy he cursed too much
"Ecuador hijo de puta"  That part was pretty dope
Sean Oh'Myleg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Momma oMaley should have breast fed ol suga sean
@UFC gives us: Chito VS Rivera / O'Malley VS Dvalishvili next!
Ecuador hipp
Sean o malley with the fake salty hand clap at 0:13 LMAOO
Sean O'Malleg
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
Igual el chito nunca se aprovecho cuando se le doblo el pie.
Chito all day
O’Malley leg: Chito was never my friend
Welcome to the CHITO SHOW🔥🔥💯
Sure, some people were too far in on the suga show hype train. But there are also a lot of people too happy to call him ‘exposed’ suddenly aswell. The worst strikes he took were after he fell to the ground of his own accord out of injury. Great win for Vera but O’Malley still has a lot of potential. There’s so much hate when young fighters get a big push from the promotion
Chito "Immigrant mentality" the kicker.
I think he is handling this wrong, its a weak win.  What if Sean just twisted his ankle?  Its dumb to parade around with a win like that.
Vera and Eddie Bravo should be on jre asap!
Rogan went IN and right OUT of podcast mode after Chito mentioned his podcast at 0:43-0:45 lmao
Chito kicked that nerve on malleys calf
that guy is cool I am a fan now
🇪🇨🇪🇨😎🇪🇨
🇪🇨♥️🙏🕺
He watched joes podcast 🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
Marlon "if you wanna kick with a kicker make sure you ready for a kick" Vera
Lol Bruce always says "the VERY 1st round"  little salt in that wound loser.
If the ufc game were the rap game O’Malley woulda snitched 💯 that ankle looked like Allen Iverson crossing over Michael Jordan 💯💯 O’Malley you were marketed purely on the Clown Show.
Too much VEGAN !
Sean O'Fragile
yeeeaahhh
It's nice to see a fighter who, for once, giving Joe what he deserves, wich is trully respect 🙏
Chito is bitch if he thinks he actually won that fight straight up!#FACTS
Sean you gotta drink more milk my man
This is what I kind of hate from MMA now. O’Malley was up and coming and lost. Now, Chito could be seen as an up and comer. Hope he can keep the momentum. Same with Masvidal, guy had hype and lost. Nobody can rack up wins or great performances in a row. Which means the UFC has great talent all around but c’mon, we want stars that win.
chito👏👏👏👏👏
haha even UFC knows Spanish bad words
g shit
It's weird to hear Joe say "so much hype behind Sean O'Malley" like he didn't help create the hype.
Hey vera you are not a winner,Rematch???
Reminds me of conor v diaz but less exciting and lower level of fighters
Sean may have lost the match but he could very much win an oscar for his acting
I put that money on Vera I knew what was up
*HE NEED SOME MILK*
Man idc what marlon thinks he won cuz O’Malley got injured watch the rematch
Lol he milking that ankle for all it’s worth
Maycee Barber tore her ACL in her last fight and still didn’t get finished
I'm very happy that Chito won. He is making the American dream happen for him.
Great Interview Mr. Vera.. Good luck
Vera kicked Sean in the knee the same way DJ kicked Cejudo and caused the same exact thing to happen. Yall mma fans are idiots if you think Vera didnt win this fight.
Tremendous!!!!!!
I saw the replay today an Chitos kick trigger O'Malley s door to give in . So yeah that was a legit tko
O’Malley rethinking those face tattoos real hard rn
Marlon power!

Marlon Vera, lo 1° que tu hija se recupere pronto,lo merece,y así una vez que esté bien,ya no tendrás ninguna preocupación dentro de la jaula,arriba el "Chito".
Has anyone ever seen a UFC Figher sprain his own ankle? How did he break his own ankle? To be honest i thought Chito looked like a deer in headlights and Sean was looking good. Then he trips on his own ankle! How? Theres no rocks or uneven ground.
Injuries suck wtf
O’Malley wanted to be McGregor so his foot turned into a balloon
You can just see the respect Chito has for Joe
Chito vera
Chito won cause he conquered his inner bitch
Just rewatched and O'Malley starts stumbling after a kick at 2:54 to the side of his knee. It seems to have hit his peroneal nerve and deadened it it's the exact same injury that cejudo had in rd 1 of the second fight with dj. Can't call it a fluke with that
Welcome to the Chito show!
GARBAGE STOPPAGE
Powerful Joe Rogan.  Immigrant mentality dawg.
C H I T O OO O O O O OO O
It’s funny to see the comment section laughing at these athletes after an injury. People who don’t fight and never have fought. I don’t care how much I dislike a fighter I can’t imagine what type of sack of shit can laugh or make fun of injuries. I’m assuming it’s the type of people who wish for the other teams star to be hurt so they can win instead of wanting two teams at there best to go at it. Shameful people. Huge internet trolling losers who are miserable with their life so they live in the comment section.
Chito on Joe's Podcast make that happen now
Everyone acting like this win was an accomplishment. This was luck. Guy only won cuz O’Malley took a misstep and broke his foot. Who gets in a fight with a dude and fractures his foot and wins and then brags about it. Chumps. That’s who.
#EcuadorconChito
Cool let's go Chito
Man. The love he had for Joe was special. Mad respect. He’s right tho, Joe is the man. And today, Chito is the man as well. Props to both of those guys. ❤️
Нужен втарой бой
He got lucky!! He didn’t win nothing!
ESA ES HIJUPUETA 🇪🇨🇪🇨🔥🔥🔥💥💘
Vera won by injured foot of O´Malleys... How can you be so happy from the win against cripled guy? What a cripled character...
Vera is a great fighter but he didn't do shit in this fight - O'Malley beat himself.
Sean “Puzzy Foot” O’Malley
While I hate O'Malley, no one in the comment sections has mentioned the injury caused him to lose. Nothing to do with Vera winning.
Its not easy to fight without a leg ...
I dont wanna sound like im talking shit but Suga Sean just fought his first real opponent.  He has been given cherry picked opponents and now got a real dude put in front of him. Guarantee 100 everyone gonna say he lost from that injury but I truly believe with or without that happening Sean was going to get ko'd
Rematch https://youtu.be/ylUrj117-jA
Your the man legend
Chimaev is the next hype train to be derailed
All these comments are retarded
Talking like he won fairly. Your win was given for real. So be humble cause you didnt win legit
Gracias Por Dale en Su MADRE a ese Payaso!
haha i got that "immagrant mentality" he's clearly a fan of Uncle Joey
When you spend all your vc on hair colors and tattoos instead of nerve endings in your foot
proud moment for Joe when vera referenced his podcast cause that's literally the core essense of Joe Rogan as a human also; always improving without making excuses.
Not his fault that O'Malley couldn't perform but don't pretend like you did anything special.
Nothing against Chito but this was not a victory. Much less a TKO... It was a fluke.
Marlon didn't win that fight. Sugar lose that fight. There is no winner.
O'Malley thought that beating a bunch of no ones can make you someone... welp, it didn't go that way for him
chito was gifted the win, and thats the truth
COWBOY STADIUM NICK DIAZ VS MASVIDAL. MAKE IT HAPPEN DANA
Sugafoot Sean O'Malley
He knows he didn't win this
Merab gonna beat Chito in boring fight soon.
I heard O’Malley’s wife dyed his hair back to normal
Aqui el comentario en español  Ecuatoriano =arrecho nunca muere y si muere ,muere arrecho
This idiot got lucky I don't know why he's acting like he didn't recognize that if not for that foot injury he knows he would have lost I don't know why he's acting like he knocked them out with pure skill
Sean “ Bambi “ O’Malley
So proud of you bad ass..!! 🤜🏼🇪🇨🤛🏼
He lost because of the haircut curse in the embedded vlog series
Imagine doing nothing and showing off like your the shit
Viva ECUADOR👍👍👍
Extremely happy chito, he deserved it.
lol love how he got the same color hair as the flag of his opponent thats how brain dead ufc fighters are
I can't believe John turtoro beat omalley 😂
Marlon "Immigrant mentality" Vera
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Love to see the underdog win . O’Malley was probably feeling too loose or comfortable, we all know he likes to be loose and have fun in the cage .
This guy was getting ripped by Sean with a busted ankle, he didn't do shit all
Holly shit carnal your the man..go get that gold G
Marlon Vera landed a kick on O’Malley’s peroneal nerve at the point where the clock was showing 2:54. This immediately made his foot go limp and eventually roll over causing the injury.   https://youtu.be/SwsxtIp9zPU
Im liking only because of and for joe rogan.
Nooooo. I hate u chito. Go to h
Chito looks like a future champ.
Foot O'Swelley
Who gets complimented more as an interviewer/commentator of a sport than Joe Rogan?
He got knockout and acted as if his ankle got injury badly 🤣🤣😂 what a drama queen
The Chito Show
yougot yourself a new follower bud!
The Last Fifth Robbery To Chito Vera
Ecuador CHITO Vera we Proud Of You Homie We Win Destroy that guy Talk Some Shit And Painting the Hair the Flag of My Country is a Karma
Sean should learn how to kick properly and maybe lift a weight once. Sticks break easily. I was so happy this unranked hype train lost. Love the energy of Marlon Vera
Sean was pushed to fast just to make UFC money, not himself the UFC. Vera is a talented fighter an actual fighter not a WWE 'fighter' like the UFC want
O'Malley's face tats made him do the C-Walk
No love cause he's Spanish?🧐🤘🖕👌🤣🤣👺😎🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐😂😂😂
Viva #chitovera
he is good on the mic
Where is the part of the interview where chito talks about joes podcast? I’m guessing they cut that out
Duro Chito Vera  🇪🇨
Chito Vera le dio por el chiquito al payaso presumido y le rompió el culito mandandolo en camilla Chito: puro verde marisco papá y yuca. Payaso: yo como MCdonald. 🍑👈➡️🚑🦽🤕 🤣😂😂😂
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Campeón duelale a quien le duela
If you wanna kick with a kicker make sure you’re ready for kick - Marlon Vera
Immigrant Mentality night, love it!
hahaha i love how chito acts like he did the damage bros literally just a gate keeper and thats all he'll ever be
Trump Pence 2020✅🇺🇸😀
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158305563739760&id=605614759&sfnsn=mo&d=n&vh=i Por esto gana Chito Vera
Cody faught hard fights. Yes he can be a toss but O'Malley better have some respect now. Wouldn't hang one minute with dillashaw etc
Vera acting like he just fought the greatest fight of the century but only won because of an injury after O'Malley had been the better fighter in the first half of the round and then calling an injured man a "puta". What a fucking scumbag he was. He should try showing some sportsmanship and act like a man instead of a pathetic little boy
Why Omalley was joking about Veras wife?
Gotta respect Vera. He’s a classy fighter, a man with a plan. I wish the fight would’ve gone longer, but congrats regardless!
Chinto le partió la pierna de 2!  https://youtu.be/A5tdgQAZuVY
❤️🇪🇨
🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
Sean crybaby!
Chito RULES! Sean don't cry hahahaha
Rainbow hair didn’t work for tekashi ain’t bout to work for sugar
Viva Ecuador🤬...!!!🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨❤️
He has a win over one of the most famous stars in UFC,  and still the press dont give a shit about him. It feels like munhoz vs garbrandt, Cody is still a star and Pedro a prelim dude
Imagine being Sean. Looking in the mirror and seeing your hair colored in the flag of the dude that beat you. Feels bad man.
Some say Chito won becaus of Sean's injury. Chito would have won either way, injured or not.
🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
Izzy is the only one to live up to the Hype! Just how good is Adesanya?
🌹🌹🌹
🍎🍎🍎
*Sucka Sean Clown Show* has Mt. Dew bones.
O‘Myleg
I loveeeee Joe Rogan .
Hype train derailed! 😂 I love how the fan girls will try to cheapen this win. O'mally is soft and not elite. He can only win against no bodies.
Sean “He need some milk” O’Malley
I'm a big sugar fan but it's clear chito kick put his leg out then they didn't even want to let chito celebrate when he jumped on top of the cage when that's something everyone does. Congrats to chito great win!
Chito Vera acting like if he did a real KO..LOL what a joke..the only reason he won cos O'Malley injured him self..!!
2:07 He said it best lol.
En mi canal dejé subtitulado al español la conferencia a Chito Vera, para quien le interese
Let's go Chito..way to go.
VERA DID FUCKING NOTHI G
Damn, people piling on Sean after his first loss.  Reminds me of when a guy gets jumped and gets beat up, but if any one person squared up fair,  you'd get your ass handed to you.
fool you got the W bc an injury pretending like you KO the guy or something gmafb
This guy acting like he legit beat Sean and didn't just benefit from a freak injury.   Like yeah you got the win, but stop it, you were getting pieced up before that injury.
These chito fans were all quiet before Sean’s leg stopped working...give chito merab, see how that goes lol
Hoki😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dying his hair Ecuador colors was disrespectful AF. he earned that ass whooping
Glass leg and glass chin.
,,Some people aren't made for war.."   Says a man with a Glass Jaw.
Shhhet  im sad for Sean.
I share the Same Birthday as Joe rogan. 11th August lol
ECUADOR CHUCHA!!!
HUMBLED AND GRATEFUL
It's cool seeing more fighters give a personal props to JR
Ecuador!stand up!
For all the pressed O’Malley fans that think he self-injured his foot: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CD9EHX2j1HX/?igshid=1773eltgj3t55
Choti is good but I think sean can ktfo of him if his leg was okay and we all know that but the comment section keep pretending like chito won a war against sean.
he said he has immigrant mentality, Joey diaz school 😀
Vera is not a winner fiuck
O'Malley was hoping Vera would hold him on the ground till the decision like last time. Second leg brake.
Rematch needed
Vera talks about a check here but mentions a calf kick in the post, the ball bone you got on the outside of each calf at the knee, if you land a kick there, all nerve control down is jeopardized. I’m surprised this doesn’t happen more or maybe It’s what Vera said, he’s a kicker. His kicks are just that much more crucial I think
If you rewatch the fight. Vera lands a calf kick at 2:53 of the round. You see O'Malley roll his toe and then another trip up which Vera then points at. So I'm sure the kick deadened the muscles which led to the big ankle roll. So I think that confirms that it was a contact injury and further legitimizes the victory for Vera. Just think it's important thing to notice.
He won’t win a rematch he’s a one trick pony.
O'Malley needed a fat slice of humble 🥧!
honestly no disrespect to his skills but Chito Vera is a fucking clown. Can't wait to see him get smashed again.
O'Malley's body cannot keep up with his technique, I see him being injury prone the rest of his career like Dominick sadley. He's got to change up his game now because he's been exposed a few times now with his foot/leg and everyone he faces in the future will be smart enough to take out his legs. No legs = no suga show
Un orgullo chito gracias
Vegan diet, don't try it.
ECUADOR HPT 🇪🇨❤
-You’re the fcking man                                        J -Thank you Sir.  LOL
JONES JONES TERMINO CON EL DEDO ROTO Y NUNCA SE QUEJO ESE O'MALLEY ES UN CHISTE
Grande Chito.... codazo en la jeta y TKO. Viva Ecuador y Latinoamérica.
My pudmi out hahahahaha
O'Malley: I'm gonna beat him easily His ankle: are you sure about that?
Did he say he checked o malleys kick and that's what caused the injury. Really! And what's with the I've got 15 kids to feed bull. Joe I would take no pleasure in hitting a guy on the floor after he injured his ankle like that.
OMG! Eso si no me lo esperaba... Juraba que Sean iba a ganar el combate, pero por comportarse como un sobrado en plena lucha y en redes sociales le pasan estas cosas, ya se que el es un "showtime", pero ya faltar el respeto a un país pintándose el cabello de color de la bandera esta mal ya que todo tiene un limite. Muchas felicidades para Vera que consiguió la victoria contra alguien que se decía que lo noquearía.   #KARMA
run it back! oh wait, sean cant even walk.
The Shuga Show just got cancelled. But there’s an opening for clowns at the circus.
Everyone acting so over the top about what this means for Sean.  No big deal, leg clearly gave out. It happens. Recover and go again.
This fight was shit. O malley hurt his OWN foot. And chito only took advantage of that. And that’s strategy? That’s common sense.
" I got 3 kids I need to feed " real motivation
What a legend this guy is.
😎fedor was the hw king for more than 10 years (not the best hw)😎😎😎Cain had the best skills EVER SEEN in a hw (not the best hw)....stipe beats a guy who is already 41 yo and  SHORTER than max holloway...woowww he must be from another planet.😂😂😂
Sean O my ankle Malley
Rematch that shit
Similar tattoo to McGregor and same arms wide open pose before the bell. Why do all these fighters try so bad to be like McGregor? I like this guy vera tho. He's himself and just straight up sincere. Real. No over compensating trying to be liked hes just respectfully himself. O'Malley caught got in his own hype and got humbled. It's a good thing to get humbled, this will make or break him. Hope he comes back stronger and better as a human being.
You just Lucky, so don't happy too much
If your gonna keek  weet a keeker you gotta be ready for da keek
Suga and Chito look like they’d fight someone downtown over a Xanax bar. All jokes aside I hope O’Malley heals up though
Go chitooooooo....¡¡¡
Ecuador ikueputa
I fucks with Vera. He's a true G. Keep feeding you family my dude.
I like Omaley but something told me this fight might go bad for him.
You will never get as big as the Suga show or Conor without haters clinging to your nuts. These comments are proof of that.   Suga will move on and keep rising. Cheeto will always be stuck being Cheeto.
This dude looks like his name would be Cheeto. Lol.
At 2:55 of the fight chito throws a leg kick that lands on the knee of suga and wraps around behind to his knee. Suga them immediately switched stance and becomes lead foot heavy. From that point on he kept rolling his ankle. The kick must've disabled or at least numbed his leg. Legit win by vera
Quick everyone, do all the meme comments you’ve seen other people do before.
so this fight was Mcgregor vs Diaz poor version?
Suga just broke. Vera is battle tested, big difference
Another hype train that derailed. Glad to see that this douche lost
"Ladies and gentlemen"
Herb dean out here handing out Ws.
The kid needs less Suga and more protein.
Marlon Vera By KO, TKO or DQ	+1100      Big congrats to the guy that bet $40k on a Vera TKO right before the fight.
Sean "Too much sugar" O'mally.
Vera won and that is it! Is isn't his fault that Sean lost control, what was he supposed to do? He took advantage when he saw it as he SHOULD HAVE! STOP CRYING
Damn comment section is all kinds of fucked lol
Sean "snap crackle pop" O'Malley
Nice i hope sean will never get a win anyday
Im willing to die at every single moment - O Melly his foot
I was rooting for Chito Vera, but props to Sean O'Malley for being the first openly gay man in UFC.
Sean o malley please don't lie about your foot, I saw the replay and you just slipped bruh
But the win was weird O Malley injured himself and lost because of it. I wouldn't feel like it was a legit win if i was in Chtio's place.
CHITO
I seen this coming thats why I commented last week I wasn't sold on the sugary even though I like him as a person and ive subscribed to his channel  but it was there that I didn't like him not taking chito Vera serious being over confident and worrying about the next opponent after he knocked out chito in the first round big mistake and i seen this coming i dont care what anyone says Omalley is finished his legs are not cut out for mma boxing maybe!!! Sorry sugasho but this is reality the fantasy is over
Chito"immigrant mentality" vera
Ecuador está con chito 🇪🇨 we all ecuadorian have the dog inside us! Don't count us out! We are brawelers, we fight! We win! We conquer!
O’Malley gonna come back again and rematch Vera... he gonna knock Vera... that’s my point of view.. today was his bad nyt.. any ways congraz to Vera..
"I'm ready to die in that cage."  - Sean O'Malley's ankle
Chitoooo you knocked the Ecuadorian flag colors of his head and raised them up real high ñaño  thank you for putting Ecuador on the UFC world and showing them that Ecuadorian dog Inside of you.. sending you mad Love from Sunset Park Brooklyn N.Y 🇺🇲 Manta Manabi Ecuador 🇪🇨
I had a feeling Sean would lose this one. Not the way he did but lose all the same. Too much hype,too soon. Not from other people but from himself too saying he is the best striker ect
Los latinos a Suga : Que pasó amiguito
”I appreciate you Joe you da fuckin man”........ this dude is trying to swoop on Suga’s bromance Haha 😂
Splenda Sean O'Malley
Look at his face , he knows he got lucky.
Eddie Wineland punching air rn
Hype. A word not used as much as it should. Great win for a good man. Congrats to the successful gamblers!
It was just bad luck. Pro soccer players do that allll the fuckin time!  doesnt mean sean SUCKS?!?!  Some many people quick to jump off the sugar train bc he took his first L.
I voted for you my boy Vera ✊
Hype train derailed I knew it, crazy how so many casuals really thought O'Malley would stand ba chance against any top ranked bantamweight 😂😂😂😂
Dana grinding his teeth this morning
Sugar lost because he didn’t shake chitos hand at the weigh ins
Sean “ I fell short to MJ and Ali” O’Malley
We all know Chito won because suga fucked his leg up. Lets be real. If they ever run it back suga wins
Lmao this comment section is too much rn
Sean at 145 would be interesting.
Let’s go I swore I was gonna lose my bet
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Lil McNuggets got sauced up with some salsa
O’Malley would fuck him up in a second fight, he got lucky
Conchito verga gran comentarista de mma.
Sean "chicken foot" malley
If you don't notice a guy falling in front of you over nothing at all and you don't advance and capitalize on the fall, well your not going to go too far in UFC Congrats  God Bless
Esto es justicia para Chito después del despiadado robo de la última pelea O' Malley perro que ladra no muerde!!!
The hype train derailed
Felicitaciones Chito desde Ambato y sige adelante (manaba arrecho ......hoooooooo)
Sean "Rubber's" foots
Sean O'Malley: My foot was a balloo... Connor: 👀
Blame the ankle.. then ACT accordingly to let people know he lost because of his ankle.. PATHETIC
Sean look like the type of dude to only eat chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese
Chito 🤡🤡🤡
Money well spent seeing O'malley lose like that..
Lucky win honestly Sean was piecing him up, i'm not even an O'Malley  fanboy or whatever tbh I still think he has a lot to prove and the guy is cringy asf.
Sean my foot was balloon 🎈  O'Malley
One of the worst stoppages I've ever seen, the ref looked like he was responding to outside reactions to the elbows and leg injury.
Suga Sean gtfoh
Oh I bet O’Malley’s so butt hurt expect a whole video of excuses , hey O’Malley go up to featherweight and start drinking some damn milk bra!!
Yes
Suga show is over
This guy acting like he actually did anything to win that fight hahaha
Shane vs Paige van vant BNF title.
sii chito gano , lociento por no apoyarlo anoche me dio sueño XD
6ft And Fighting at 135lbs can someone pls tell me he doesn't belong in that weight class. Can we also respect the fact that vera gave him time to recover unlike other guys they would have took advantage and beat them up.
I'm a fan now...
I’ve never seen Bisping say he lost because he only has one eye 😂 stop making excuses 😂😂😂
Sean O' Malley had a bad injury, thats the only way you won.
He checked that leg kick something crazy
Sean "he needs some milk" omalley
'Suga' Sean O'myleg
This guys celebrating over winning on a guy who got injured...classless
this guy is actually funny 🤣🤣
Im so proud that man is from my country
LMAO THE SUGA SHOW COULD NOT HANDLE THEM LEG KICKS THAT THAT BOI CHITO, CHITO TOOK THEM HOES LIKE NOTHING TUFF ASS DUDE !!!!
Its cool win the mouth peace is ko'ed ! Big talk no back up o'malley ! Sorry man but thats what happens in the MMA ! Forgot, DANA !
Sean should’ve watched Karate Kid 😂
Well the Sugar Show got canceled 🙃. Too much weed clouds ones mind. All that hype and talk eventually you will get humbled
🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
Sean "now I just deliver autoparts for a living" O'Malley: I should stop smoking weed and go back to fighting bums.
THE HYPE TRAIN HIT A WALL
This show just got sugar free
The Chito show sure is shit. He is high on his horse after beating someone who crippled himself lmao.
I didn't realize O'Malley is so hated. Seems like a nice kid and it looks like the only reason he lost to Vera is because of a really bad foot injury.
Wise man once said never fall for the hype train. When you hype the fighter he loses his focus on training .Eg Johnny Walker and now Sean.Both very good fighters but the hype killed their performance. And a humble request to the fighters .please don't copy Conor.
🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🤣😂🤣😂🤣👊👊👊👊
Bien hermano 👍🤭🤭🤣🤣bravo bravo 👍👍😎😎😎😎😎
DUDE HURT HIS FOOT ... AND CHEETOS THINKS HE'S A BAD ASS...LOL.
Ecuador hijue...!!! ahhaahah <3
hype train has been nuked by the foot
now suga has his opponents flag dyed to his hair SMH XD
o'malley
He tries to make it sound like he went out there and beat Sean O’Malley Sean beat himself dude rolls his ankle and can’t fight anymore but for the first four minutes he was whipping your ass
To beat sean just dance around the cage and play defense, eventually sean will hurt himself just like the time he fought Andre, hurting his foot by kicking him
Once he hurt is leg it's over. He will get a rematch.
Let's be honest o m" Malley was winning every second of that fight until he injured his ankle.
Chitoooo
Yea !!!!Cool!!!
Unlucky for Sean, the fight could of gone either way if he wasn't injured
If anyone honestly thought that Sean O’Malley skinny weak ass was really gonna climb the division like that come on
El deportista del año sin duda
Sean” went from suga to shit” O’Malley
YES. Next JRE Guest will be Vera!
Lol Sean was lookin rough at weigh ins lol
Get that kid a glass of milk ffs
caaaasshhhhhh
this man got lucky that sean got his foot broken if he didn’t this man would’ve been ko’d
Chito Vera respect fighter and person if sean decides to keep fighting  is his problem he can decides to quit the fight any moment  sometimes  in life humans should be more honest
WOOOOOOO!! I won big time on this one Boiz! I said Chito is easily a top 10 fighter.
🇺🇸
lucky
Thank you for beating that clown
Look this!! O'Malley injury explained. Chito's victory is 100% fair https://youtu.be/A5tdgQAZuVY
Sean o malley.... https://youtu.be/PKkREYxELZQ
This chito dude think he so good😂😂😂 Sean couldn’t even walk and he actin like he did so much😂😂😂😂😂duck ass dude😂😂😂
UFC the only organization where the fighter praises the interviewer .
Omally played the "completely crippled" act too much. Vera's leg kick affected his nerve behind the knee. Happened to Henry Cejudo against DJ
chito actually landed a calf kick and Sean started to wobble near the cage after that...
Chito “immigrant mentality” Vera
GRANDE VERA!!!! VIVA LATINOAMERICA
“O’Malleys connective tissue has left the chat.”
Choo da farking men chjoe - Lov from Chito
The limping show at the end was some bullisshh...he was not even limping that bad in the fight..total hype train
Vera got Lucky...….....
Logan 3 sneeze excuse sounds better one than suga's
Love this guy
Respect 👌🏾💯
I love it when a good and unrealistic hype is  exposed 😂😂
"The dog I have inside is bigger than all these guys"
When hype a young talent goes wrong, O'Malley welcome to the club with Phillip Nover, Sage Northcutt, Paige Vanzant, Johnny Walker and Uriah Hall. O'Malley weakness got exposed.
Latino beat the hell out of O Mally oat meal biscuit
Damn, that’s like the third hype train derailed just this year alone? Hooper, Shabazian, and now O’Malley. Anyone think of any others that had a perfect record and is over now in just this year? Also next month Adesanya vs Costa is happening so one of them will have their perfect record broken.
That dog got one handed to him tonight
ITS NOT CLEAN WIN
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I knew that little clown would get his head bounced of the canvas. Nothing special about old pencil legs 😂
Chito kicked that fool on the nerve around the knee, which made Omalley collapse . Very good win for Chito.
Chito you are the best
O'Malley lost without beating a single ranked opponent. Now I see why he was scared to fight them. At least he made a little money first
"There are levels to this game" (Frankie Edgar after beating Yair), and the UFC should have kept Sean fighting slightly tougher fights BEFORE a Chito fight. Suga wanted to jump the line, but he didn't have the skills...yet.
'If you wanna kick with a kicker , make sure you ready to kick"- chito vera
He should just take online gaming seriously & stop fighting.  He got godlike fighting skills, But a body of a peasant.
"I got the immigrant mentality" LOL
Everyone needs to lose once         Except khabib ....
Vera a true dog! A real warrior but yet ol Dana won't promote him like he should.
Chito "If you're gonna kick with a kicker, make sure you're ready for kick" Vera
love seeing cocky pricks like O'Malley eating elbows... messing with peoples countries never goes well.
Sean injured himself by himself, plus it was an early stoppage  That little tattooed shit didn't win .
Big foot silva  Small foot suga
Fake injuries he did the same thing when he got ko
Ecuador hijue p.... 🇪🇨 thank you Chito for give us that victory 🙌💯
Thank you lord for knocking that arrogant Sean O Maley down a couple pegs.
Marlon vera ha
This dude is always breaking his damn foot
This dude probably breaks his foot so much cause he so tall and so skinny
In Suga's surreal dream that had him feeling like he was suspended in a alternative reality,...he'd already defeated Conor, Cody, and Cejudo becoming the "champ, champ" for all his "Twitch FAM.". He'd watched all the YouTube fan reaction videos of him knocking people out. The hybrid version of Cowboy's ranch and Rob Dyrdek's "Fantasy Factory" with a foam pit, gym, etc, had already been completed, years earlier while on his supersonic rise to the fame he'd always obsessed over as a kid, long before he knew what he'd be famous for. He had an undefeated record of 30-0, and he still mentioned in every interview that "I reeeeeeeeally like knocking people out in the first round. It's what I do.",...as his eyes were opening, finding himself staring at the ceiling of the UFC Apex Center in Las Vegas Nevada, he saw a blurry Herb Dean waving his arms while using his body to protect him from the beating his head had been taking only seconds before.  As it all came into focus Suga finally realized that all the ego and self righteous opinions about other fighters lives, from their dating to their inferior speed and natural skills, meant absolutely nothing when finally matched with a relevant, highly successful fighter.  And as the Suga Express derailed off the tracks, crashing violently into reality, Suga had an epiphany.  Maybe I should hype myself less, care less about being rich and famous, sell less "merch", worry less about my UFC 4 video game avatar ranking, and perhaps refocus on developing a fighting style that eliminates all the fancy footwork that keeps breaking my ankles and feet.
We all knew that was going to happen. Sean O'Malley is overhyped to shit, everyone was saying "yeah give him Cody, give him the Elites"… no. Please no. He's good with kicks and his right hand, but he doesn't train as much. If he did he'd be a beast. He has untrained natural talent for fighting and that's it
🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
It's one of the most beautiful things to see a cringe hypetrain crash. Vera's a hero!
Lol so who was it that said sean could beat garbrandt?
The hype train has been derailed!!!!!
Sorry Chito. You won, but didn't BEAT him
chito didnt do shit, he really think he deserved to win that
Sean "my foot was a balloon" O'Malley
Sean "Suga Toe" O'Malley
o malley lost from nobody today sadd
I knew Marlon would win this.
His left eye is weird
They need to do it again and hopefully it’ll be a great fight regardless of who wins
My foot was a balloon 🎈
upcoming 'chito vera humbles o Malley' video soon
Look how fast everyone switched up on Sean
OH PLEASE!!! That wasn't even a fight ...Get real..
Sugar Sean would've made a great soccer player.
Now EA should have no option but to put Marlon Vera in EA Sports UFC 4.
You can see Chito is a JRE fan "I got the Immigrant Mentality"
Don't talk too much if you never fight top 10 in the division! Talk less do more!
I cant believe sean lost am i in a nightmare
Yoder got robbed
man its sad that this fight end like that
Haha he’s got that immigrant mentality! Love it
I like this guy no BS works hard gets the win.
Duuude never expected this
It was a bit early imo.
Man i been screaming about chito Vera for years since the ultimate fighter. Im so happy to finally see him get his moment. That man is deadly! Them elbows were brutal.
Sean milking that foot so we forget that he got slept with them elbows
Chito “immigrant mentality” Vera
Salty Sean O´myleg will end up in Bellator within 3 years
Suga needs some milk!!!
Who remembers when o'malley said he could beat Mcgregor 😂
Congrats Vera another hype train is over 💪👏
i follow joe podcast and i respect chito even more cause joe seen 10000000x of fights and all champions etc. and he explains in detail the different regarding and average joe to the top 10 as long as yout top 10 contender the level of fighting skill has a major gap.  good to know he listens and takes in the advice as well.
Very unlikeable dude
Chito is much more intelligent than people give him credit. Kudos to him. “I have kids to feed and house to pay” if a man has a why, he can bear any how. Good for him! He’s gained a fan in me tonight.
Hype train derailed. Literally almost zero promo for Vera glad he won. Tough loss for Sugafoot
I like the way Marlon talks. I'm a new fan. Good luck to him
Sean "I was inefficient with my ankle bone calcium energy." O'Malley
Man that's an unfortunate injury for Sean and this fight could have ended different but congratz to Marlon he has been on a role also 💯
I like this guy he is a true fighter
Joe, how could you call this the biggest victory in his career? He did not really defeat Sean nor did he prove anything really. Let's be real here. I am actually disappointed with Vera after this interview. Showboating a win caused by an injury. If he had any pride he would have said he was not happy with the victory and give a rematch.  And all these so called fans celebrating Sean's loss like it says anything. You guys are a bunch of pathetic losers if you celebrate a win/loss like that. This is coming from a guy who also thought Sean needed to be humbled. I derived no satisfaction from this fight. Tho I would definitely watch a rematch. Both guys looked sharp from the get go.
Vegan bones
Early stoppage
This man act like he won by KO 😂.
Chito Vera is the next big superstar....mark my words
This is one of those damn moments where i shouldve placed a bet! I shouldve put money on Vera!
Don't die your hair likentekashi69
Who prepares the octagon floor? It is obviously badly glued. That hurt O'Malley ...
My foot was a ballewn!
The immigrant mentality! Joey Diaz inspiring!
I had omalley but I didnt doubt chito
talking like he dominated O'Malley. Stfu, couldnt land a shot untill his opponent literally couldnt stand on his own anymore.
pffff thats playing of "ohh my leg hurts so much" like footbalist player. What a sad way to accept the lose.
No immigrant mentality comment , disappointed 😒
Suga foot O’Malley
Was that really a win if O'Malley hurt himself?
I do not want to hate on Vera. So I won‘t. I will only say that it is weird to celebrate a victory that OBVIOUSLY came by injury as if you beat the living shit out of a person.
not for nothing. i would not celebrate like that win a win like that; its like hunting a wounded gazelle. just saying.  do it again on the rematch and he'll have my respect.
Solo te puedo decir  gracias chito  gracias  x deker en alto a Ecuador y que cena que aki somos arrechos
Glad that crayon lost, dude needed a reality check !
Did he just say i got that immigrant mentality?
I hate the MMA community
Suga DIABETES lol
Good performance chito vera 👍
Weak ash
If seans leg isn't good then he doesn't need to fight again  We don't wanna see more fight from him
Alllllll aboooooard
Sean O'malley the type of guy to ankle pick himself before Tony does
Sean “My foot 🦶 was a balloon 🎈” O’Malley
"I've got immigrant mentality" hahahahaha
Marlon "if you wanna kick with a kicker make sure you ready for kick" Vera
Wonder if there will be a rematch?

I hope ppl dont shit on sean now
Ooooo mr.noodle
Sugar got eliminated by salt
Joe Rogan looks tougher than the fighters  lol
shiiit first shaybezen and now o'malley, i know dan gotta be crying backstage lmao
His got the Stipe Miocic Mentality!!
He need some milk
Just lucky win..
what's up with hating a dude that's been hyped a little bit these days? ufc fans are the worst two-faced people i've ever seen on the internet. you can easily tell sean works really hard, in nearly everything he does. one day they like the fighter and when he tries to hype the fights and acts a little confident, people pray for his loss. absolute no-lives
Its always cool when someone gets humbled

Another hype train derailed
Vera swore like he had a good performance 🤣
Sean not on Conor lvl like he said he was
Thanks *Chito* for *turning Sean ( spaghetti leg ) Suga Free*
why is everyone just ignoring this douchebag is using rashads nickname
Yeah sean cannot fight at 135. He gotta go up to 145
Exactly, he doesn't throw numbers, thats where you go in and catch him with volume, well said chito.
lol funny how things turn out! 1. Perhaps this will bring Suga down a peg or two now, as his ego was starting to become out of control, a few more wins we would of been looking at another mcgregor mentally and I don’t think anyone wants that shit anymore, it’s boring and cringe worthy. 2. You can always tell when the ufc are trying to build someone up, ie lots of footage of them shown (more than other fighters), more media coverage, more focus on them etc. This isn’t a smart move when they do this as it just inflates the ego. It’s also not smart cos when they lose they look stupid, especially Dana white in this instance due to his brown nosing of Suga (hahaha bitter sweet 😂)
I like this guy's personality.  Well done. Glad to see Pennywise lose
chicken feet
Ecuador Hjptaaaa 🤣
Why he talks like he dominated o’malley
He won fairly he is no Chito! Sean was way overhyped and should be deeply embarrassed to get KO'd like that, he should spend less time at the hairdresser getting jazzy haircuts and more time training. Massive Fart Noise to those saying Sean would totally dominate the division.
Rogan is such a shill.....
Sean "Brittlebone" O'Malley
Poor Dana....
Shuga needs milk babyyyy!
karma hits for sugar for disrespecting opennents
"the immigrant mentality's allways there, you follow me?" -Joey Diaz
"Nobody moves like I do." - Can you see why, Sean? Stop jumping around thinking you're a video game character, The loss was the best thing that could happen to Sean. His ego was running away with itself. He knocked out a couple of bums and then called out Conor McGregor. Nah son, Sit down, STFU and wait til you've beaten someone ranked before saying anything ever again.
O'Malley came out for a party... Chito came out for a fight.
Latinos 🔥
Guess it wasn't the suga show lads
Not surprised. Sugah Hype Train is now on parking
Damn O’Malley’s fans are non existent in the comments now, where y’all at 👎🏽🤔
So happy for Chito man. He deserves this!
“If you want to kick with a kicker make sure you ready for a kick” - chito the kicker
Sean is nothing but hype, got taken out in the first round by an unranked guy lmao
Excelente Ecua pa q sepa
The Steroid Show got derailed, what a great weekend.
69 sister got knocked out hah
Damn that slow mo roll with weight must have hurt like a b1tch.
"I'm willing to die at every moment in the fight" *licks lips...yeah u dont want to fuq with this man
They eye poke from miocic changed the fight and everybody knows it. When Daniel did it he even stopped and stepped forward to apologize, stipe was trying to step and and finish Daniel the last few seconds of that round. Fighting without depth perfection is hard to do because you're vulnerable from attacks on that side. I think had DC went to his wrestling he would have dominated stipe and got the result. What's even worse is that john anik even said video review is available at any time during the fights and Goddard didn't even take a look at it like he could and should have.
"I've got that immigrant mentality" 😂😂 This guy is following memes.
Some Ecuadorian humble pie!
im not surprised!
Красава!!!!!!!
He won because of a rolled ankle .
Sean was calling out guys like TJ and CODY.  Not sure if thats a smart move
O Malley is a good prospect but i saw him losing this fight,experience counts a lot
Suga "tekasi69" o malley
Suger whatever the fuk looked a little scared all fight
Sugars trainer to sugars foot  "Your the baddest mother fucker , your a champion baby"
they have to rematch
Sean was in a position just like Cain Velasquez was when he fought Francis it was really his foot/leg/ankle that made him hit the canvas.
Comments are gold lol
“I’ve got that immigrant mentality” Joey Diaz will be proud
Wanted to see Chito win this fair and square and end Sean's hype. Kinda sad his ankle gave in and brought him down before Chito could since it ends up taking away Chito's credit.
I immediately recognized when Sean's knee started to shake before the fall that he got hurt. Probably something to do with his footwork and balance. He pulls and faints with his left leg in orthodox stance but his right leg just stayed there, it might be tough on the knees and ankles.
Vera is as real as they come, just being who he is. O´Malley should take a page out of his book.
HE NEED SOME MILK
Don't worry My cousin Adrián yañes it's in the line he is not a clown like fck o melley
He is next
Cheeto
Look like he done that on purpose just to be like oh my ankle... I lost because of that little fake trip...
Go Ecuador and Chito. Hype train Omalley seems to be a bit injury prone, back to the couch
Told yall 6ixnine getting fuckdup!!! Vamos!!!
Can i get a refund for O,Malley's jersey ?
CONGRATS CHITO VERA !!!
this guy won due to the injury and he's talking like he beat him fare and square lol
So much for the Hype..Hahaa
omalley will be better after this
Suga show my @ss..first real fight,first tko...hype as hell..
Sean "LGBT" skeletor
Sean with the big Ego , its time to get down to earth buddy ...he's done
Chito Vera will be top 5.
Such a shitty win, but people hate O Malley so of course they will clown him over this. If they run it back O Malley smokes him. This dude doesn't realize how lucky he is.
he’s from chone
At 4:20 lol
Sugar never lost
Can't walk suga talk .....bum....
Ahahahahah
Big mouth O'Malley got his face smashed with a couple of nice elbows. Such a classless punk, coloring his hair the same color of the Ecuadorian flag. His arrogance was his weakness.
Im so glad Sean got beat. He was becoming really arrogant with his cockiness
Sean 'open relationship' O'Malley
When you buy Conor McGregor from AliExpress you get Sean O'Malley
Great stoppage. O’Malley went limp with that last punch.
The Embedded hair curse strikes again
Marlon Vera great performance👍
man as usman said ~at one point in life somebody has to humble uh 🔥
This thime you have luck
I liked that he lost, the other guy, sean whatever.
That wasn’t a victory 😂😂 he wasn’t out 1 and 2 he hurt his foot so stfu and rematch
HYPETRAIN DERAILED😂😂😂😂😂 Sean "Legs out of suga" O'Malley
Cocky hypetrain D E R A I L E D !
VAMOOOO CHITOOOOO, VAMO  LATINOAMERICAAAAAAAA
That boy Marlon tryna secure the JRE podcast invite 🤣
Watch it be a rematch 💯
Suga frail...
Hahaha weres seans big mouth now
Look at everyone Turning on Sean O'Malley 🤣🤣🤣yall fake
According to marlon: Sean chiwawa O’Malley
Too much Suga is too bad for health ,  over estimate self its bad !
His foot was a balloon
Sean "Over confidence" O'Malley
The hype train got derailed
Well done Chito👍
Weed broke his bones
And O'Malley was talking about KOing Garbrandt. Ha ha ha ha.
Sean acting it up when chito gets his hand raised
Bruh suga gone hear fo a minute didn't get to  c all but took a step n timber hopefully not his career cause I fucks wit him no cap lol stay safe out here BLM checkout The Main Squeeze🙏
Suga cry baby o mami derailed
Vera is a clown for even thinking he won, I could’ve went in there and gotten the tko win over Sean. A wins a win but when the rematch comes Vera won’t hang
More sugar weakens your bone
O'Malley all hype. No sauce
Rub some dirt on it son
Hahahahahaha
Chito "Stop Train" Vera HYPE TRAIN 🚄(SUGA) MEET STOP TRAIN 🚅(CHITO)
HYPE TRAIN 🚄(SUGA) MEET STOP TRAIN 🚅(CHITO)
Suga is the only fighter who can trip over his big toe and roll his ankle #Pussybones
Baby bones suga hype train got his ass whooped 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥this is amazing
He didn't do the post fight conference ?
I knew he was a hype job
Can’t lie I’m glad he lost
Marlo Vera: I fucking love you Joe Rogan                      Sean O’Malley: Joe Rogan was never my friend
Suger Foot would never stand the same again
I was hoping Chito would humble O Malley. He needed to be knocked down a peg cause he was getting too cocky and it was annoying.
Chito Vera is very smart, and people that underestimated him were checked today.
🇪🇨💕
Eres el mejor
Te amo
Imagine celebrating a win you didn’t even do anything for haha
Cheeto acting like he did something that fight 🤣
After watching the post fight shit and reading the comments of people saying the hype train is over and sean got whopped im thinking " well that sucks but might be good for him" then i go watch the fight and then get shocked because he lost due to his own injury and even after the broken foot he still lights chito up. I guess people that don't like sean went blind in the middle of the fight
never seen someone so happy to win from an injury.
Height, fame, big name...goliath....
So this is the savage that Garbrandt has been hiding from?? This is the stud with all the UFC merch?? This is the killer who’s ready for a title shot??
I actually liked O Malley and really wanted to see him succeed. Hard to hate a guy who wanted to be great. People who throw comments like "he was too confident or full of himself" are just weirdos Lol. He's young and he's doing something you're not. Hope he keeps his head up.
Bag off Vera 😂 if O'Malleys ankle wasn't messed up pre fight Vera would've had his ass handed to him. O'Malley shouldn't have fought on an ankle like that.
Se humilde no te creas..
I can now sleep peacefully at night listening to the tune of O'malley dickriders and all those who hyped him up cry in their beds ahhh.  Sweet music to my ears.  Will the Sugar fans please stand up?  Come defend your boy in the YouTube comments section!  He's hurt bad!  Btw who is Marlon Vera?  Just a random on the UFC roster?  Wait he has to be top 10 right...wait, he's not!  Wtf...I thought Sugar Show was going to be a huge problem?  Petr Yan, Marlon Moraes, Dominick Cruz, Jose Aldo, Cody Garbrandt, Aljamein Sterling, were all getting a little worried there for a second...
Not everything that shine is gold...la apariencia engaña...Los ojos engaña n....la percepcion engaña...se veia o yo lo veia monstruoso..o se veia monstruoso...grande,  cruel...ah, ah, ah, tamaño mas alto...mirada...pero el otro es tambien atleta....terror en un minuto se fue..el es fuerte..  Pero se creia..
Atlast
Chito won against a handicapped one legged man. 🤷
The hype train has derailed. Knew he couldn’t win against a skilled fighter.
Lmaoooo, Sean was unlucky. I’m sure they will run it back eventually. Congrats to my latino brother tho
*"Sean O'Malnourished"*
He atacc.... He protecc..... but most importantly he drinks Milk 🥛 💪😂
Rip Joe Rogan 😞
lets all take a moment to respect that suga did predict the 1st round ko
This dude has a personality
Sean Mamonley 😆
I don’t know this man I won’t pretend i new him before  either, but I’ll tuning in to fights from now on that’s for sure 👌
And just like that the omalley hype train is derailed
Really impressed with Marlon. I really like his attitude and he’s pretty talented. Would love to see more of him
Chito said paint my hair like Usada’s flag.
Glad to see that clown get his goofy ass handed to him...congrats to vera
I find it funny sean was talking about putting cejudo lights out but got carried out on a stretcher lmao
The clown car swerved....wheel came off...and boom right into the big top...
Strange, I break my feet the same way when in danger
I’m not impressed when Sean comes back gimme a rematch see what happens
"This is the Chito show"
Chito was going to win regardless
Awful to see Sugar get injured again, hope for a speedy recovery.  All respect to Chito for being relentless! He seems like a genuine cool dude. Jobins represent, Sugar Sean will be back in a big way 🤙🏻
Why the hell is everyone complaint about the stoppage. Skeletor couldn’t even walk lmao. Chito would’ve done what Andre Soukamtaht couldn’t do
Checked Kick is very reasonable cause the same thing happened to Anderson Silva, his leg was injured initially before the broken leg moment, it's very possible cause the force and power Malley throws kicks
Both Marlon Vera and Pineda were slept on a bed of nails, thanks odd makers Easy Money! Easy parlay wins!
I've always like Chito but he became epic after this fight. Very composed and a really nice guy. He even gave omalley a chance to recover when he first rolled his ankle
Chitos kick damaged O's peroneal nerve
2 trains derailed.
Vera went in to fight, malley went in to dance........
SUGAR SHOW GOT SPOILED
Good finish...
Bruh why are people acting like he won this great fight? He was getting lit up by sean even when sean had a broken ankle.
He need a to go Thai land or something he lives to comfortable if he wants to fight for a belt
The way I saw it was O'Malley was giving Vera difficulties with movement and fakes. Vera was reacting too much on the fakes, but as it was early in the fight, he was finding his range which came into play more even before the foot injury. Because Vera started feeling more comfortable, O'Malley started making more over the top foot movements, like his "wobble" fakey just before the injury. He tried to do the same move while moving and either had a "wobbly" calf muscle from a kick or never tried that fake while moving ever in training. Sorry O'Malley, "protect yourself at all times" also means that if you hurt yourself by doing moves that make you look silly, and end up on your back in an elbow downpour, accept the loss and focus on coming back better and stronger. I like both fighters, but showboating usually turns out bad.
Knew omalley was going to lose the moment he stepped in. He didn't look confident.
To be fair. This guy stood 0 chance of winning if O'Malley wasn't injured. But its a fight and these things happen so good win. A win is a win in a fight.
DMT:"AND THATS STILL MY BOY"
Screech got fucked up
Every hype getting destroyed except adesanya
Would have loved to see a longer fight without the unlucky twisted ankle...
Might not always agree with Joe but everyone loves his poddy's
Ohahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaj
He don't deserve this win. smh
Suga's ground game is terrible. Any of the top 5 will maul this guy to pieces. His stand up isn't enough. Both his legs were flailing in the sky when he was on the ground. He didn't try to progress to side position or anything - just flinched, got elbowed and put to sleep twice or thrice. OVERRATED
Until we will know better, for now we need to accept either: non contact injury / cito's calf kick / cito checking low kick. Whathever, Suga is down and looking like a fool after all that talk..
The hair curse is still going on strooooongg!!!
Sean hurt his ankles more than curry in his early career
The fight should be overturned to a No contest Sean was robbed
Lucky shet
You call this a victory??
Lucky boy fc i
So sean didnt beat a not even ranked contender , then cody would have busted him up probably, you have to understand that your full body can take it , and if you hurt your leg already at a age like that you probably fight waaayy below your weight or he just skipped calcium smoked to much weed and didnt use any sports legal nutricians like Calcium to strengthen your bones. 5.11 and then fight at bantamweight. It's not steady and you hurt your self big time. Good luck on his next fight though
Vamos chito ....excelente.
I knew it
Going out on a stretcher is abit cringe
Awesome I like this guy
I thought O’Malley was a lot of hype and again while Dana and Chael get it wrong , I’m right .
Come to see people talk about how chito thinks for some odd reason he had a dominate performance when sean just broke his ankle
Suga smoke weed everyday
I can't believe that people are shitting on O' Malley the guy has otherwordly talent and he will def comeback in brutal fashion and devastated guy....The same guys that shit on him are the same one who will jump on his train when he delivers his highlight reel ko in his comeback
I just love how humble and hardworking Chito is, he always has his feet on the ground and ignores all the bad things in life. That’s the Ecuadorian spirit! Vamos Ecuador Carajo!!! 🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
I hope Sean’s leg was compromised by Vera checking his leg kick because who would want to win a fight due to a freak injury. Just sayin
Everyone has mad respect for Joe Rogan! Fact is, he is an absolute legend! The man JR 💪🏽🙌🏽
Why does everything seem to be quiet after O'Malley We have a really tough contender for 135 be ready👍👍👍
The Curse of the Schmo 😂
Surprise Motherf***** -Sean O'malley's foot
🇪🇨🔥
Theres a guy betting 40k on Vera, hes the real winner
this is why kicking styles are not good. It's such a high risk and moderate reward style. O malley just isnt quite ready
Everybody want to blame his foot but he got beat ground and pound. It had nothing to do with his foot. He just has no ground defense
Run it back
True champion ! How the fuck can someone bet on sugar baby?
Sean “12-1” O’Malley
Omalley fans shouldn't be too upset. Marlon is great! He's gonna be a top contender for a long time  and could be a bigger star than Sean potentially. & Sean will comeback strong he's still an entertaining fighter
Before today EVERYONE was on his nuts. Look at every one of you hating now lol.
Im so happy sean got hurt hope his leg never recovers properly and DC got poked i hope he goes blind in that eye
Yeah but suga got hurt
At least Sean got his prediction right. That Chito guy won
Dos hombres en el camal a esto le llaman arte
Man sugar blew his knee don’t think you beat him in full health 😂😂
Yessss thank god that fake stupid clown got exposed
I knew it. This rainbow head guy is all hype. Lol
Suga limping for excuses
https://youtu.be/q7J6ijujUW0
He’ll get you in the rematch! Lucky for you.
THIS ROUND OF HUMBLE PIE HAD SUGA IN IT!!!! Sweet af 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I liked that interview
Derailed....
Big deal, he beat Post Malone.
Once Paulo knocks out adesanya all of the UFC’s hype trains will be done for and they’ll start to tank in the profits
Another hype train derailed!
If I’m Vera I would not be satisfied with this win and give O’Malley the rematch to really see who the better fighter is, yes Vera took advantage and did what he had to do but he shouldn’t brag, I can understand if he was dominating him before the injury but in this case a rematch should happen once O’Malley heals up because nobody was actually winning
I smell Rematch!     🍻🙋‍♀️
Hype train derailed
CHITO A GOAT
Now that the sugar show hype train has been derailed, I can't wait for that rat Chimaev to get knocked the fuck out.
Atleast we don’t have to hear the Suga Sean fans talk about how he’s gonna be champ this year😭
How you want me to lose?
People defendig sean saying he was injured or stopped early lmao Chito checked his kick and it o’malley fault to stop rolling and running but chito was the real deal im glad he didnt push thru the decision bc Cody would actually break omalley leg lmaoo
No walkaway KO this time. O’Malley couldn’t even walk away after the fight. 😂
Joe faking it he loved that bumb I made cheese today hell yah I knew he was k.o dat bumb Shawn was more hype he cant fight Joe says some one is great bet against it its the rogan curse he dose it to every one
O malley looks brittle at bantamweight he should move up to 145
Also chito's da man!!
Suga's train got derailed BIG TIME!! He's got a velasquez ankle now!
All the hype train got derailed, Starting off with Johnny Walker, Edmen, Masvidal, and now we got O’Malley.
Marlon litteraly just got a fluke win. Didnt even touch him ONCE before the injury and everybody is acting like omalley just got brutally KO'd. Shows how fickle mma fans are.
Sean looking like a multi flavored gummies
thank you chito!!!!!!
Hahaha I knew the clown would lose.
Sean is fucked now 🤣 Im so happy for Marlon , he walked the walk , Sean only talked
Safe to say that the Sugar Show got derailed. Everyone is living Sugar Free from here on out.
“it hurt itself in his confusion”
Legend says Sean is still stuck with that Ecuador colored hair 😂
This is what happens when u blow ur own trumpet
Another big mouth bites the dust. 😂
Bruh why is he acting like the man when seans ankle litteraly just snapped and he jumped on him... no skill
Damn O'Malley got shut out by a dude that's about to be snack food for some real ufc fighters.
Chito el mejor  el titulo es  tu yo  ....ECUADOR  . .....ECUADOR  ...😎😎😎😎😎
Really ESPN, why you cut the part when Chito said that he knocked out O'Malley, that's the most important part of the interview, because a lot of people thought it was a early stoppage, but it wasn't. O'Malley was out twice for a bit, but in the last time he have his arms down, so it was a great stoppage...
the sugar fandom turned into salt real quick.
this is why you shouldn't get your hair styled on UFC Embedded
I think when Sean threw that front kick in round 1 it hit Vera's knee that might of done something to Sean's foot/ankle. But good win from Vera
Isn’t that eyeronic don’t ya think
Man Vera is acting like he took O'Malley apart where he simply got lucky with Sean's injury. What a clown
People will say chito didn't really beat him, but the bottom line is this: if you blow your body out and can't fight lol...what are you going to say? "I would've been champ but my foot..."? No shit, Sean's body wasn't made to take damage, that's it.
I am so proud of Chito Vera. Congratulations from Ecuador. You are in a big moment. Keep focused and train hard. You can do it!! Make us proud
Me foot was a ballewn
Suga is more concentrated on Megan olivi as compare to fight training😉 😉
I hate to be a hater, but I knew Sean would fold. He was too full of himself and isn’t as talented as he thinks. All these people just jumped on the hype train recently and were automatically “huge fans” even tho they only watched a few of his highlights. I’m glad to see him lose but not out of a hatred, but so that he’ll be humbled and that leads to him being a better fighter. And more likable of course 😂. Congrats chito !!
Fight was boring and vera didin't proved anything.
Funny all the “Suga” fans are now Salty 😂
O’Malley: Nothing a pint of milk can’t fix in the after party
Chito "thank god for O'Malley's foot" Vera
Suga free
Sean “gets sniped” O’Malley !
Anyone looking to buy a octagon I know a guy.
Drink some milk , sugar !
Chito a hero to derail that clown car Suga Sean o'mahleg out the hypetrain
Sugar tried to do a Conor of being cocky.. but overconfident and derailed
6 in a row in the bantamweight Division but lost his last fight on paper
I LOVE how the casual fans are now hating on their god. He’s a PED cheat. Get over it
I can’t wait for mojahed’s video on this😂
imo that was a total fluke but whatever
Sean "bones of chalk" O malley
Dvalishvili Vs Vera now
Sean should be a basketball player, breaking ankles like that takes serious skill.
thank you for shutting o’malley up lol
another hype ended
I didn’t like this interview. I never discredited chito from the get go and was hoping sean won. If that was a real bad leg injury then I wouldn’t discredit seans skills and call him basically just a hype train with nothing behind it like Chito did. Maybe he won the first round other than the leg injury but it definitely was not a blowover. Saying he has no “dog” in him like he does is bullshit because it didn’t go outside the first round and wasn’t really a clean finish regardless. Who knows what would have happened if the fight continued. Chito got a legit win but be humble jesus
Marlon AKA Chito AKA Jacinto Vera...is the only way that you could win my friend...About ZEPI O'Malley: Every LIVER have what he deserve
Before people go and discredit Marlon.  O’Malley seems to be fragile, he’s busted that foot before against Soukamtath and Andre couldn’t finish him. Vera is a killer and was gonna break Sean’s face with those elbows from guard.  And Vera checked and landed a leg kick on Sean that very easily could’ve numbed the foot and caused it to roll like when DJ kicked Cejudo in their second fight.  SUGAR FANS, YALL MAD
Can someone explain to me why Sean was wearing a Irish Reebok kit before he walked into the cage? Like bruh I get you like Conor but come on!
"VAMOS ECUADOOOR!!  HPTAA!! " ~Chito Vera 2020
So much for those spinny kicks...huh omally
The swelling went from o'malley's head to his foot.
Marlon Vera is legit, dude's a gangster. It will also be interesting to see how O' Malley bounces back from this loss
He who laughs last, laughs best
Suga was landing brutal kicks and even after he tripped over his own foot shown in the replay footage he was still winning the boxing engages  before he fell and couldn't get up. I'm no Sean o malley fan but you people are sad just admit the truth, he got gifted a free win 🤣🤣
i wonder if O'Malley still thinks he's the best striker the UFC
And Sean said he could beat Conor and Cody lol
Thanks a lot Chito and UFC! Greetings from Ecuador.
Apparently O'Malley has renamed himself "the sugar foot show"....
VIVA ECUADOR
O'Malley hype beasts right now 🤫🤫🤫
Sean is milking that injury, I've seen fighters keep going with way worse.
Clowm omaly
Chito smoked him.
I knew it!!
Sean "I dont love you joe rogan anymore" o'Malley
When a prospect loss: hype train delaired; but whenever other fight loss: it is what is. For sure O malley will comes back stronger, and Chito is a seriously top contender in the bantamweight division.
If you really come to think of it o Malley should have already had a loss on his record, but the dumb fighter sukkahrahman decided to go to the ground with O’Malley who had injured his foot.
"I have that immigrant mentality"🤣🤣🤣 he's definitely watching the JRE podcast!
Before o’malleys ankle roll chito threw a low kick and suga switched stances right away
Jo Rogan  is the best commentator and interviewer
Grand theft hype
Like rogan said he won the fight b4 this 1 also great fighter
Forever chito
I hope this Humbles O'Malley he started to feed into his own hype I could tell by his disposition
All this time I thought this kid was a clown, but he is really a total wimp. An amateur and embarrassment to the sport.
Arriba Chito 🙌😠
No way Eddie doesn't get him on JRE
Stevia Sean O'Malley
And this is why you don't overhype fighters to a point to be ridiculous.
"The dog I have inside is bigger than his foot bones"
Chito brought up Joes podcast because he wants to be on it but Joe shut that down right away
lol and Suga was calling out Cody and got beat by this dude....
Sean o malley..try to gain some weight man.. Too slim for a fight, improve ur calcium as well
I never liked his fookin rainbow hair glad he got knocked out
Malley's chicken legs can't hold his wt no more  🤫😂😂
I'm glad he got TKO,BIG MOUTH
People saying Vera only won because Sean injured himself? Watch the fight again, Vera landed a good leg kick on Sean about 3 minutes into the fight, it made Sean switch stances and then a few seconds later he stumbled and fell on his leg. Vera injured Sean and deserves credit for whooping his ass
The fight was going well until he injured his leg. It's the second time that happens to him and i'm afraid its something that will never really heal fully. Sucks to see another confident kid lose, we need more fighters with personality in this sport
Suga fans need to actually watch the fight and around 2:57 Chito throws a low kick and from that point on Suga changes stances and starts backing up and circling. Then starts using the feints heavily and rolls the ankle. The ankle was already compromised and Suga knew it.
Sean was talking to much shit on Instagram haha he lowkey deserved it
BTFO
O Malley acting stupid with tht leg after the fight! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good lmao hahahahahahaha 😂😂😂
Sean got some nice punches in, he is a dynamic fighter and he was just getting started. Round one was about to end anyway. And it's not really any win to brag about if O'Malley tripped backward and let you come in. WTF. Anybody can just get in a ring and start kicking away but Sean was fighting with skill and not just waiting until he threw another punch then throw your knee up. That's not fighting. Sean could have grabbed Vera's ankle three times with all that kicking malarkey. And Sean wasn't even knocked out, the Ref stopped the fight. I dunno. If you're looking at skills, Sean is the winner.
Who rolls their own ankle in a fight? Glad Sean got finished that guy beat no one and thought he was God’s gift to MMA
Sean O'Hypey
I wish I could bet in my state, i called this fight for verbatim
WIN VIA LEG INJURY
People out here acting like he really won the fight he got lucky bro he was getting his feet kicked out from under him I can't wait till they re book it
Everyone hates O'Malley so much they're acting like he got destroyed lol. Quit lying to yourselves people. He'll get humbled in due time but 4 elbows from a 35er ain't it. 🤷‍♂️
Suga Sean ”the second comming of Brian Ortega” Omaly
Another Hype train crashed 😂... Getting tattooed like McGregor and posing with open arms in the middle of the octagon like McGregor come on dude be real..... Infact "SugaFree" looked slightly worried just like McGregor when he faced Khabib 🤔..... There is only one McGregor in this game and he is the best entertainer no matter win or loss.... He attracts audience 🔥🔥🔥
I'm not even an O'Malley fan but let's be real about how this fight went. Vera got lucky as shit and he's going to try riding O'Malley's name for clout
lol he only won cuz o malley got injured
lol u win because he was injured
"My foot was a balloon"  Sean O Mqlley
Suga got popped dropped and stopped
Suga is as brittle as a sun dried suger cane
Good job herb dean u stopped that fight faster than Sean’s mom even would have
It's one thing to be happy about the hype train losing and another thing to be praising chito. Chito acted like he put together a world class performance when he did not.
Dana white tomorrow morning -" Who the fuck is that guy" if anyone asks about Sean O'Malley.
Gotta love the comment section when an overhyped fighter gets put on his place
Lol Omalley looked awful even before the fake injury. He completely yanked off his foot taping on his way out on the stretcher, he wasn't hurt😂
Chita much respect to you brother the belt will be yours soon!
Fact: It was Chito's calf kick that limped Sean. Sean didn't injure himself. here's the video https://streamable.com/qln12x
sean was faking alot, when it came to his foot, it didn't work. It looked like a sprain maybe. I also think chito got into his head. It all contributed to what happened. I sensed a little acting at the decision to make it obvious that he lost because of his foot. We'll hear about it. No fluke, All credit to Chito.
I very happy about this.
Fun fact: Chit O Vera is Steve Os twin.
Only takes that one loss then everyone hates you huh.
Suga Fans: 'RUN IT BACK!' LOL,   Your boy can't even walk now
i love  both fighter . but omalley  was not taking vera  Seriously .  a lot of innecisire mouvement
None of those matter if you put in hard work or something he said. DUDE he fucked up his leg tf you talking about even tho Sean is kinda annoying cmon man don't act like u didn't be the luckiest man this night smh
Well in Sean’s defense he did predict a first round KO
Where all you omally worshippers at??  I said this was going to happen I said he has what it takes to be a legitimate great but he will most certainly lose a few times and that would only make him better. He needed a loss to humble him. He wasnt entertaining cocky like conor he was just asshole cocky. And he wasnt even slick with his words its weak af. But like I said I'm sure if he can manage to walk straight in a fight he will bounce back as a potential Goat. That being said the Omally that's been in the UFC I cant stand. Let's see how he is a year from now when he comes back
Chito is rising to the top. Mark my words. Poder latino!
Honestly hope Sean is healthy, he has had two of these injuries already. I am not a Suga fan but your body limiting your abilities is not great.
Nobody should want a win or take a loss like that  Rematch
Sean lost because of an accident and that's a fact. I was rooting for Chito before the fight, but the way he handles his win the way it happened is just sickening
Thank you chito for the $$$$
Ecuador in the house!!!
I bet vera tko 2nd round =(
It would have been better if both fighters could go the later rounds
Would've been worse if he fought Cody
Parece hecho de cristal, no quiero tirar hate pero si presumes tanto debes respaldarlo en el octagono, se ve a leguas que queria ser mcgregor pero por lo menos este era muy bueno en el octagono...
Kids on twitch are going to be pissed
Suga Fragile O'malley was just hype flashy hair flashy tattoos instead of spending time at the hair salon he should have spend time training hard,I did not see a single punch thrown by O'malley good for Chito  overcoming adversity from that bully thinking he was going to KO him in the first round  , he proved that" his skin is thicker than his mom".
1:35
Sugga Free Show 😂😂😂
Idk why everyone thinks chito did something he was LOSING and suga show hurt himself rolling his ankle lol
He did get cut on embedded
O'Malley was robbed!
IMO Sean made his foot look bad by acting  , so that chito's win over him will look as fluke. I don't know. Looks like it, i apologize if I am wrong.
Fucked up his ankle doing a faint,pretty bad train derailment tonight boys. Disco Stu fans on suicide watch for the rest of the weekend
Sean fanboys where you hiding?
Tattos & dying hair doesn’t make u badass.
Chito stole his Train and now he riding it !!! Great job Amigo
So unlucky sean
This is a joke right? Vera is a clown for acting like he dominated O’Malley. He got injured, and you jumped on him. Congrats on beating a one legged man 👏👏👏
mad respect for Joe Rogan he had #chitoforchamp
O malley trying to be conor SOOO bad
NADIE SE HABÍA PINTADO ASÍ EL CABELLO EN Ecuador COMO O´MALLEY
tragedy at its finest lmaoooooo  only person to beat sean is the ground
If His Foot Wasn't 100% So WTH He's Been Kicking That Much And That Hard🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
lmao where were ya'll when o'mally was winning? i'm a suga fan and i'll stay one  cuz im no bandwagon bitch
I’m glad O’Malley lost, highly overrated
Thats what happens when you look past your current fight and are already calling out  your next opponent.   Never disrespect the sport or opponent   like that.
What do you expect from gummy worms head O'Malley. He's over hyped, - all he does is paint his head with stupid colours and smoke weed. The guy doesn't train enough. Glad he lost, maybe it'll be a wake up call for him.
Guys let’s take this moment to pray for joe. You were a legend and will never be forgotten 💔. RIP JOE💔💔💔😩😩
TKO fest tonight
looks like omalley will be out another 2 years :P
Suga sean more like suga gone
And you tought he was gonna beat cody
so funny seeing the herd mentality come out here as usual in the comments. I don't see Suga loosing that fight without that injury he was in complete control up until that point. But much respect to Chito Vera i'm not trying to disrespect his effort but too bad he had to win like that.
Not Veras biggest victory Joe.
those fients and all that stutter stopping was over the top and he rolled his ankle like a fool.
Lmfao
So Sean O'Malley is the Derrick Rose of MMA huh...pretty sad tho
Run it back. It’s not an honorable victory if it’s earned from an accidental injury rather than a injuring him with your strikes.
I like sean a lot and I hate to see him lose like this, but Chito has made a fan. I really like him and I'm glad for him and sad for Sean at the same time.
Vera : thank you suga foot
Stipe wins via eye poke and Chito via O'Malley's ankle      more so for O'Malley but... that eye looked holy crap nasty.
Hype train derailed hahahaha 😂
Let's go Chito
rematch is coming vera. talk while u can.
Sean 1'Malley
Who’s still rooting for the clown?
Tremendo orgullo ecuatoriano 🇪🇨 vamos chito 💪🏾
Six in a row 😂
I can't wait for this rematch 😂
Achilles Heel
If you wanna kick with a kicker be ready for kick.... if you wanna talk trash speak English. We got great deals in America for you Latinos
Dude hurts his foot and this guy is acting like he actually did anything, that’s nuts. Sean will go farther than this guy ever will lmfao. Plz relax bandwagon fans.
rematch
sean got rocked on the ground. Almost went out
ECUADOR!! 🇪🇨
Felicitaciones chito
Khalabib stipiocic
I’m so happy rn
So happy for chito
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Splenda show....
Unlucky Sean, that leg maybe a problem throughout his career
Hell yeah!!! Fuck suga!! The sugar got watered down!!!  Chito the man!! 💪🏽👊
That is awsome forget that clown. I'm glad he lost
People saying Sean was beating Chito up and all he was doing was throwing leg kicks lol
Sean "My Fooot was a Balooon" O' Malley
Sugur free O smelly
Grande chito supongo que darás la revancha dada la circunstancias que ganaste!!!
sugur free O smelly
Chito i just got lucky lmfao
a mi sinceramente no me gusta ninguno de los dos pero O'malley se vio frágil;  Va a haber gente que dirá que se torció el pie solo que Chito solo aprovecho el momento pero la realidad es que hablo de mas y en la pelea se vio. He visto peleadores como Anthony Pettis ganar por Knockout con un brazo safado, he visto a un tuerto ser campeón y defender su cinturón y he visto a Mcgregor pelear con el ACL roto .Cuando cayo al suelo pudo haber usado su jiujitsu que tanto presume pero al contrario solo resistió 3 golpes ni intento pelear  y reacciono peor que Silva cuando se rompió la pierna
My foot was a balloon
This pleases me
If i learned one thing its that everybody in the comments is broke
O'Malley lasted longer at the barbershop lol
Omalley needs to get back on the steroids 💉💉💉
Suga sean just remembered mid fight to bend the knee
As arrogant as Suga is his skill can’t be denied. I’m hoping he can recover soon
Yamasaki: you call that a stoppage? Smh
Spanish blood
Stipe decision was fair and square. But without an eye, DC was in the latest rounds pretty good. If Stipe fights the rematch like today with Francis, Stipe will get exposed. The power of Francis doesnt compare to DC, one punch and Stipe goes to wonderland
he doesnt have the dog i have inside 😐
Sean coming back stronger
Now everybody makes jokes of suga Oh man you are all so funny
Buena Victoria chito 🇪🇨❤
Lets GOOO CHITOOO <3
O' Malley has a knee like Ben Askrens hip
Love O’malley but he thought he was competing with the sun for the center of the universe. He needed this to bring him back to reality.
Suga sean o mah leg
Chitiooo
If y’all remember same thing happened to cejudo.   There is a nerve in the leg and if kicked hard in it makes your foot go numb and you can’t feel it for few mins.  So it’s hard to move on it.  Watch the cejudo fight I think it was against moraes or Johnson?  Look it up, it looked the same exact way.  Only differences is cejudo didn’t hurt his ankle and that numb feeling goes away after few mins. Ugly fight all around.  Crappy loss and crappy win.  Wish this could be done over to really see who has better skills.
The guy seems like a really good guy
Sugga who
Suddenly everyones a bunch of Vera fans...lol
Chito started checking Sean's leg kicks, and Sean was trying to readjust from the flashy footwork to a more efficient one. And in the process, he rolled his ankle. So all credit to Chito, he forced Sean to readjust and Sean injured himself.
Humbled
Ecuador  carajooooo es lo único bueno que pasa  gracias chito  por esa alegría que nos das
ECUADOR PAPA 🇪🇨 ¡VIVA ECUADOR! 🇪🇨
Hell yeah! Good work
This is what happens when you aren't in your bag
No one:  Suga Sean: my ankle was a balloon, my ankle was a balloon.
Somewhere on this planet.. Cody Garbrandt is smiling. 🤪
It's sad when fighters act like him after beating an injured opponent. Especially when both fighters barely even got to do anything before Sean's weak*** leg gave up again lol. But they're fighters.... can't expect them all to have class.
This is the weirdest reaction to a fight I ever seen. He beat the guy after he was fatally wounded. If this was a life or death situation he would be crippled and dead lol. No one is talking and acknowledging it would of maybe been completely different without the leg failure
White cancelled his hotel reservations with o malley. Condoms, whip cream, strawberries, and lube oil all gone down the drain.
That foot 2nd time already... he would have had 2 losses on the record.
Where does Urijah fit into all this?
O'malley knew ecuador will win thats why he dye his hair like that
Well folks. There you have it. Another great white hype. Gone down the drain for Dana.   Brock. Ronda.  Conor.  O’Malley.  They rename that show from Dana White Lookin for a Fight to Dana White lookin for the Next Great White Hype.
Chito has the personality, he’s gonna be big like Masvidal now
Lol O’Malley looking pretty stupid with that hair now
Chito woulda got slumped if seans foot hadn’t got injured. Vera sucks and Sean is the future
rematch
Bro, your boyfriend like, totally lost, like.
The arthritis show
'the hype' is over forever and afterlife..😂😂🤣🤣
That clown O’Malley broke his little pencil leg 🤣
o'malley savia que ecuador ganaria por eso se pinto el pelo asi
They way he stepped on that foot in the fight was nasty as hell
I knew it that Chito Vera will end the hype train! Sugafree
Finally someone humbled that cocky flamingo!
He hurt his own foot 🤦‍♂️
Chito is the man! My boy had that crusty the clown looking joker’s head go bouncy bouncy on the canvas.
Dude was getting beat the whole Time. o'Malley blows his ankle out then still outlands him by alot hoping on one foot.then it gets stopped on one of the worst stopages ever and all these lazy bums sitting on their asses shitting on o'Malley when their broke asses clearly didnt even watch the fight and dont know what happened.
heal up Suga and go on “Dancing With The Stars” them sign with BKF
Ehh, idk man. Sean was doing decent until he pulled a type of Silva and..Chirs..Fuck forgot his last name.  That being said, congrats to the dude. Nasty, nasty elbows.
I knew Chito would be a tough fight for Suga Sean. Dude is no joke.
Sean was injured, but not as injured as he was acting the second the fight was stopped. Jones's toe nearly came clean off and he seemed surprised when he noticed it. Colby fought with a broken jaw. Big Nog's arm was broken and he just looked mildly annoyed. O'Malley reacted worse than when Anderson snapped his shin. He was playing it up so he could blame the injury and the hype train doesn't get derailed. Watch it turn out to be just a sprain.
marlon our here claiming he made  “adjustments” i mean he was getting outclassed on the feet and got very lucky because sean fell, tbh if dc can fight with one eye then sean could of lasted that first round
Marlon "If you wanna kick with a kicker, make sure you ready for kick" Vera 1:44 Solid win!
You don't put Sugar on Cheetos. 😂 The real hype train is Chito Vera
Suga gotta get on that mexican horse meat
Congratulations Chito!! So happy for you!
da dog bit tonight sir
12-1  Forget about khabib's numbers 😂
Lol it’s funny while he’s saying he checked a kick they’re literally showing him misstep and roll his ankle
Si awebo.....sugar no había enfrentado a nadie
why is he acting like he won fair? He aint beating Sean without some bs happening like this
Does this mean that O'Malley's opportunity mode is over?
still love o malley, a lot of people lose in this game. he’ll be back. props to chito
Sugar Sean hype train got derailed...
He really sounds like tony Montana. They world is yours Chito.
Why's joe rogan look like someone beat his ass and he covered the marks with makeup?🤣
They beeped out "Jesus Bless you." Wow lolol
Suga Caboose.  Carried out, again.
Dude I’m happy about this win, my friend wouldn’t shut the hell up about Sean calling him the next McGregor and I was like stfu 🙄 nothing against Sean though my friend just got on my nerves
Gracias Marlon nos distes una alegría enorme, solo te tenemos a ti y a Barcelona.
Immigrant Mentality - Joey "Coco" Diaz is proud of you
Sean "Insufficient calcium" O'Malley
It would of been a different story if he didn't fuck up his foot lol
i follow him on Twitch!
Without the injury, I believe O'malley could have won... He showed it with the power low kicks at the beginning and the punches on one leg... the stoppage was also kinda early maybe because of the injury...
It's all the act he doing after fight...Sean was heading forward after that too slip...it's looks all act  just to avoid embarrassment
If Sean O’Malley didn’t get injured then he could talk shit like this. I don’t respect a Cheeto.
Such haters.. Chito had nothing to do with his injury..  Hopefully Sean will recover properly and this injury won't keep coming back..
I dont know how he can brag his win when his opponent has an injury during the fight
sean beat sean
My foot was a balloon
Why’s everyone talking like Vera derailed anything and Sean didn’t get injured what does this change, paper victory Sean was already putting the heat on him
Sean " stanky legg" O'Malley
Finally sean omaley got a little humbled
The UFC needs to change the gloves It's getting completely out of hand with these eye pokes
That ending was disappointing as hell, but Marlon won that fight. He was winning to round and it so happened that Sean’s foot gave out on him. Shitty ending, but Marlon deserves credit, I mean those shots on the ground were booms man.
Like I said Vera is gonna win
honestly it's unfortunate Sean rolled his ankle when he feinted. Who knows what would've happened if he didn't injure himself. Maybe he still would've lost or maybe win by knockout but we can all agree chito vera had a huge advantage after that. Props to Vera regardless of the unfortunate injury. Vera did what he had to do and it wasn't his fault Sean injured himself
I wanted chito to win, sugar posted a videos trash talking chito's wife. Guess conor's stunts make you look like a clown when you lose.
I'm about to throw up reading these comments. People celebrating unfortunate injury and loss is nothing more than disgusting
It wasnt a gift to Chito. Suga sean injured himself due to his own feints, there had to be consequences Edit : Update: it was a calf kick by Chito that hit O’malley’s fibula and wobbled his leg.
Im surprised Joe rogan didn't ask him if he uses a sauna and takes vitamin D
Still can't understand what this guy celebrating, he would be destroyed without that foot injury.
Not a o'malley fan boy but cheeto acted like bitch all week just sad acting like he knocked out francis son you beat a 1 legged man dog shit think i saw some girl scouts walking down my street if you really wanna prove how tough you are
💪🇪🇨E.H.P. les tapo la boca a un poco de habladores vamos por más Chito toda Sudamérica y México te apollan
To chito fans, i'm sorry dawg. He didnt beat Sean. Sean O'Malley's foot just beat Sean O'malley.
It's a shame that O'Malley had to lose this was cause now there will be an excuse as to why he lost.
Dana White is right not to give him Cody too soon.. Btw Cody would also wreck that Song Da Yong mon bong bong guy.
Sean was clearly hurt
Chitos a tool bro
o'malley looks like a professional clown with a meth habit on his day off.
Sean will be back better than ever. Sean will get a rematch KO and will be right back in co main or main event big flight circle
#SugarFree
Not veras fault Sean hurt himself dude needs to drink more milk
Idk what all these casuals saw but sean was winning the fight. He established it from the beginning. Just because he accidentally rolled his ankle, doesn't mean chito beat his ass. Sean did more damage to himself than chito did. Chito was lucky sean rolled his ankle. It was obvious who was winning
Glad he is not in welterweight division.........Usman's foot stomps would have retired him.
Por creerse más O'malley, bien por Chito
Gonna be awkward when he looks in the mirror and he’s constantly reminded of it because of his hair
Got lucky was losing the fight until Malley injured himself
I’m sorry but how can you not like this guy
A loss is a loss. Welcome to the Chito Show!
Thats a BMF walkin right there..😳
He broke Sean’s leg with a kick. Watch it back. He doesn’t even know yet. Haha
Herb dean was 5ive9s guardian angel tonight. He saved him from seeing the dark side 🤦‍♂️💀😱
The over speedy train has turned on itself.
Dana White is going to abandon Sean now
I wonder how this fight would have gone if Suga didn't injure his ankle..
Another hype train derailed again. Tsk! Tsk! O'malley drowed in his own hype.
Grandeeeee chitooooo
So the question remains, how good is song yadong
Hype train: derailed
I like both fighters but Chito won me over this week. Comes across as a really humble and decent guy. Was happy for the underdogs tonight
It is what it is ....   Lose is a lose   Sorry #sugar_show
CHITO IS THE TRUTH
Maybe sean should spend less time on the tacky plastic throne of his, thinking he's chael sonnen and spend more time training #HypeTrainDerailed😂😂😂
Chito faught smart.
Sean said he can beat Garbrandt😂
OH SNAP
Sean "Salt" O'Malley
This guy speaks perfect English.And by perfect I mean I love the shit he is saying!
Such a good fighter and person.
HYPE train 'Sugur free O Smelly'
Suga Sean O'Malley slipped on his own kool-aid.
O'Malley injured before the ankle twist. Chito did it, not Sean injured himself. Check it out, it started when Chito leg kicked him while O'Malley's back was on the fence.
Only lost because he got injured.
Herb Dean stopped Suga Sean from taking a nap.... I feel Mario Yamasaki would have been the apt ref in this case....
Any real mma fan cant be happy with the way this fight ended. Coulda swore by these comments that vera won by a walk off knockout
Hypetrain derailed😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dc: eye pocking last 2 fights Stipe: yep imma end this man whole career. Damn idk why that happened on the last fight to decide whos the best 😔😔😔 nice win anyway
Que vivan los latinos vamos Chito, apoyando desde Venezuela
'Sugur free O smelly'
Not even ez money cos everyone in mma gc and gym took vera for the win LOL
If sean took the same time dying his hair in training the outcome would’ve been different
Watch the fight, and don’t make an ignorant comment. Sean was in no danger from chito until he rolled his ankle and his entire movement stalled, and even then, he outlanded chito before he went to his back. Run it back no injuries!
I’m an O’Malley fan and it sucks to see this happen, but you can’t take this one away from Marlon Vera. Dude clearly has a warrior mentality. Not his fault Sean got injured. As much as it sucks to see, a W is a W and life will go on
all these casuals acting like chito dominated the fight or some shit. sean clearly rolled his ankle which left him with a huge disadvantage. and its not even like chito knocked him down XD sean literally fell over because he put too much weight on his foot which led to chito absolutely destroying quite literally a handicap. so gtfo here with the whole " hype train derailed" shit.
Him taking the L is like the rat hes trying to be (69) takin L’s walking around ny and la right now smh.
How he act like he actually won that fight.  pathetic😂
Demo am 29.08.20 in Berlin - Fest für Freiheit und Frieden - Suche Mitfahrgelegenheit in Kassel - Liebe Grüße #haltetzusammen
Someone needs to make an edit of the Dana White/Conor baby picture but with Sean
Not impressive win .
2:44 “I appreciate you joe, you’re the fuck man”
Rematch
Sean O'Chilles
Injury won him the fight. Rematch pls
These dudes talking like Sean was outclassed, Sean was doing well until he broke his foot and Chito was smart to take advantage of it.
People in the comments acting like if Sean didn’t break his foot this would have gone the same way smh
O'Malley really milking that "injury" lol people actually think he lost because of an injury lol na cheto checked those leg kicks and smashed that hype train junkie! 😂😂😂😂
HE ONLY WON BECAUSE SEAN ROLLED HIS ANKLE PLEASE STOP
RIP SUGAR SHOW 🦶
And Still!!! STIPE! GOAT 🐐
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK THIS WAS A "FLUKE" LEMME TELL U SOMETHING. SANTOS FOUGHT JONES WITH AN INJURY ON HIS KNEE AND STOOD THERE 5 ROUNDS LIKE A MAN. FUCK O'MALLEY, CHITO WON, DEAL WITH IT .
O malley feinted too much and broke his ankle. STAND AND BANG or gtfo
Chito Vera humble & shuts Sean O'Malley verbally , mentally & physically.
So disappointed in my boy O'Malley. I lost $45.
Glad chito won...Sean was getting way too arrogant.
RIP CORMIER’S EYE 👁
Sean o malley lost because he cut his a dyed his hair on embedded
We’re all you sugar cane omalto fans u girls just vanished in to thin air like a magic trick 😭😢😭
"Ecuador hpta".  Leyenda absoluta
Give this guy a title shot
I GOT THAT IMMIGRANT MENTALITY
He should definitely be in the top 15 now. I'd like to see him fight Dodson next or rematch Yadong.
He can barely walk...fair stoppage
You wanna see hungry? That’s “immigrant mentality” right there!  All or nothing!
It is nice for a fighter to get humbled this early during his career. I despised O’Malley’s arrogsnce and then he proceeds to ko his own leg with some weird movement. It was totally self-inflicted. It is definitely not an excuse for a loss. Hype train off the rails. Nice.
DC Vs Stipe fight was like" an eye for an eye Fight".👀👈
Someone feed O'Malley a cheeseburger. That vegan diet turning his bones to glass! Also to the people saying this was a late stoppage try again, he was getting elbowed so hard you could literally hear elbow shatter dome. Plus he stopped defending himself after the third elbow, he got finished. Class act work from Herb!
So dc bitches about eyes poking when he is the first to poke can't stand dc I'm glad he lost.
O’maley getting humbled lol
THE SUGA SHIT SHOW
“i appreciate it joe you’re the fucking man”
O'malley torn his achilles unfortunately, from a basketball fan
I respect Sean, but when he said he wants to be Jordan, Ali, and BIGGER than Conor, i just dont see how i can respect him that much. I mean, how the fuck you wanna get bigger than Conor? If he said "like Conor" i can respect that but to say "bigger" is insane. Sean has some skills, but to be bigger than Conor, you must have the mic skills to, which he never will. So, Sean, its good to dream, but dont get too much ahead of yourself, you just TKOd yourself in there lol. But still, i'm in the suger show, we'll see what you got.
Keep that hunger
Apart from my other comment...is there really that much hate for suga? Did Tony get this much hate when he hurt himself tripping over a camera wire? Or is it just funny cause of the memes?  Just curious what everyone else really thought, like true opinions after the jokes?
HYPE TRAIN DERAILED. BYE BYE SOY BOYS
I don’t know why my man is acting like he kicked O’Malley’s ass lol. Dude misstepped and injured his leg. Congrats on beating a man with a bum leg. I get being happy about winning but he’s acting like he won a clean KO over a healthy Sean O’Malley
Unfortunately, everybody is gonna discredit Chito’s win tonight. Fans have made their mind up that Suga Sean is the UFC new golden child. Chito should ask Dana to run it back so he can KO Suga Sean again. Here’s the truth, if that was Chito who injured his foot/leg, nobody would’ve given a fuck
Suga Show im going on break now.
Another reason to respect conor he is the only one who talk the talk and walk the walk .Though he is different and arogant now
Seems like hype trains are just getting derailed all over the place
Fluke
Here to see all the Sean fanboys to talk shit about him now. Kid is total joke and now everyone knows it. Can't wait to hear the excuses from him..."I have stuff no one has seen as well as excuses no one has ever heard " -Sean O'Malley
Unlucky for O'Malley he was winning until he hurt his foot and couldn't even stand that's when chito landed those elbows
Tan orgulloso por ganarle a un lesionado , ánimo
He won because of technicality this fight is gonna be rematched soon and he will get smoked
I swear to God  I dreamt  that O'Malley will lose!
Chito Verá is a gangster
so happy for this man right here... fully deserve the win
Sean shouldn't fool around in front of guys like Chito. You can't beat them with an injured foot.
This comment section really shows who watches this shit and who doesnt. Everyone acting like Sean got his ass beat.. The mfer tore something in his ankle and fell down because of it later and those were the only shots vera got on him. I swear man some people are so damn insecure they immediately start hating against the guy that was hyped after he lost because of a BROKEN fuckin ankle. He was winning the fight before that and vera was barely throwing anything at him. Clear as day man. Smfh
Comment here if you wanna argue over malley being a punk Biotch  Keep scrolling if you're a punk Biotch
O' Malley: im gonna kill Chito Ve- O'Malleys knee: Hold on im hurting Brotha .
Does anyone else disagree with rogan and Cruz that Sean fucking his foot up was something Vera did and doesn’t take away from the win? I’m not even a Sean O’Malley fan, but that sounded pretty stupid to me. Ive been an athlete all my life and rolling my foot like that would definitely affect my performance and I would lose every single time if I competed with a rolled foot. Vera didn’t cause the damage, it wasn’t from a checked kick it was From rolling his foot over and probably breaking it again. I thought it was crazy of rogan and Cruz to act like Vera did all that and him rolling his entire foot over itself and limping around the octagon wasn’t the reason Vera got the finish like that. Let’s just be real with each other here, Sean probably broke his foot again and Vera took advantage, like he should during a fight, but let’s not pretend before that moment that Sean was outclassed and was losing the fight. The way Vera was talking and acting after the win you would think his name was marlon moraes and he had just starched Aljamain sterling.
Stipe should get DQ'd for that. That wasn't a regular eye poke that was knuckle deep. Disgusting dirty move.
Waiting to see how Mojahed Fudailat saw this one 😁😁
Sean tried to clap and then he's like, fuck that lol
He just got lucky
THE CHITO SHOW
Won't be hearing about Suga sean for awhile now
1:08 Marlon “Joey Diaz” Vera
Cant believe DC and Sean are the same height
Wait.. he landed 2 elbows and it got stopped?
Daniel "Bisping" Cormier
Chito Vera just won me 500 dollars!!! I love this guy and I knew the odds had no idea about this man lol
Joe with the FAKEest smile
Chito deserved to win after the robbery from his last fight and Sean deserved to lose because he’s a douche bag. Glad that train derailed.
First shahbahzyan then Suga the hype 🚆 are derailing Edit : 🐀 lip might be next
Lucky TKO, I'm Not Impressed by your performance.
Idk why vera thinks he destroyed sean sean was hurt but good job vera
Get him on JRE joe
Cheto deserves to be paid
O'Malley broke his soft weak frail fragile antifa bone kicking a real man.. Game over fanboys.
Props to Sean. He fought despite his injury. These keyboard haters don't have the bals to fight in the octagon or life.
Great stoppage by Herb
This dude was losing, we all know that and Sean would have never lost like that if he didn't get injured. Also Dean stopped that fight wayyyy too early. Vera is trash! All you haters are trash too!
Sean lost to himself. They should run it back. Not a real win
Ecuador!
DERAILEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Am i the only one here wondering why everyone in chat is fighting and picking sides thinking how both Chito and Sean are equally annoying?
Por payaso y la pintada del cabello pa que igual le reventó la cara 💖💖eso es Ecuador 💖💖
Suga McGregor: My ankle was a balloon.
Rematch!
Hype train derailed, and he tought he could beat Cody and Mcgregor.
Chito is talking like he won that fight with a walk off ko lol ... he didn’t even won in my opinion... his opponent got injured without even touching him ... He’s trying to convince himself that he won that fight
as a suga fan my birthday wish was ruined but gotta show some  respect to chito
Remember guys This hype train claim he will beat Conor
This fo thinks he won you lucky boy there was a clear injury whatever makes you feel like you won empty ass win. I would called for a rematch.
Nobody learns a single shit of how Mcgregor conducted himself at the beginning of his career... Don't be a sore winner
Weird that nobody acknowledges that his ankle went out.. chito is acting like he really won the fight and even Joe isn't calling it like it really was.. from what we saw on the tv screen Sean crumbled to the canvas after his ankle wouldn't even support his weight much less allow him to fight.. it's just weird how this was called after the fight..  ok chito technically did win the fight yes but only because Sean was on one leg and chito is acting like it was something else other than what it was.. he didn't win the fight in any way shape or form, it was more like a forfeit..
UFC Bantamweight Championship to Suga Sean : I won’t let you get close
Not even a Suga fan buy Chito acting like he really KO'd him, dude he fucked his leg up, and it wasn't because you checked it either.
Check me out on the tube pure entertainment 🔥
Yeah, chito got robbed last time, suga got robbed this time.... shit happens in MMA. chito will continue to be pretty good, if not great, and suga will comeback better than ever...hopefully. just saying, flukes happen, that wasnt a real fight... I mean, do any of you think its truly Competitive if one of the fighters hurts themselves early?
Congrats to Chito on the win but you can't say he don't have the dog you have inside when the reason you won is because Sean got injured and couldn't continue. And all y'all saying HyPe TrAiN DeRaIlEd clearly didn't watch the fight because up until he messed his leg up Sean was clearly piecing up Chito, and I'm a big fan of both fighters. Johnny Walker was putting dudes to sleep and got KOed by Corey Anderson. That's a hype train being derailed. Learn the difference.
Another undeserved hype train 🚂 derailed...... I LOVE IT
As predicted by everyone pretty much
I’m on the O’Malley hype train still but this guy is good I’m following his Instagram now 👽
These all are fake accounts of JOE ROGAN that disliked the vid
He got lucky he had nothing for him
Nice piece of humble pie.
Look at the title "after TKO win" they dont always say how the winner got it done. they are immediately hyping up chito and giving up on O'malley after his loss. Props to chito but you can see O'malley performance got sabotaged by his foot injury, you're litteraly taking away one of his main weapons + footwork.
Very unfortunate ending I was hyped for this fight
So glad Vera humbled him.
Some people says its an early stoppage LMAO, Sean went out twice I think what kept him up is because of pain from injury similar to Cain vs Francis.
LEGTS GOOOOO CHIITTTOOOOOO
Doesn’t matter how much you hype yourself up if you don’t win...
Song Yadong beat this chump
Ecuador🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
I like how all FANS hate fighters but us FANS wouldn’t have the balls to step in and fight
"I'm not impressed by your performance" - O'Malleys foot.
Sore winner
Suga show is over
lmaoooooooo joe asking dc INSTANTLY about the eyepokes LIKE DC DIDNT POKE STIPES EYES 3 FUCKING TIMES IN A ROW
Belleza CHITO👊💪
He really think he did something
Chito hasn't proven a thing, and everybody agrees. This is definitely an immediate rematch. Sean beat himself, with the same foot he broke over 2 years ago. Anybody who says the hype train was derailed was never on it to begin with. The train made a pitstop and is still on the tracks. Let Sean run it back.
Nah both of them are cocky...still a suga fan though
Fuck this guys speaks well. Presents himself very well!
RIP DrugO’ Malley
dale chito  , de los mejores carajo , el  cabeza de granizado se cago .
Chito Vera seems like a good dude and a great father. Can't wait to seem more of him in the octagon!
Lmao bigger then Conor , boy go back with your daddy 69 your fk clown , stick to yt instead .
Remember Cody said don’t go off on a stretcher again 😂😂
Everyone has got to chill,O’Malley injured his foot it’s not like he got knocked out or submitted just got unlucky with his ankle/ foot
suga fans on suicide watch
The Sugar snapped 😂 stop the fukkin comedy and fight better next time. Cody is sending you the laughing emojis
1:35 😂😂 Sean needs to stop that juking shit
great defensive fight son love your work
Sean should work on his not leaving the arena on a stretcher.
rip in peace
This man is the shit  "Ecuador hijuepta" jajajaja
Suga Show canceled early tonight
Even Dana was talking all week like O'Malley already won..smh!!
O MALLEY O MALLEY O MALLEY O MALLEY-Sean o malleys leg surgeon
O malley immediately grabbed his foot to show the camera “it’s because of my foot , I didn’t get tko “
I like how he talks! Let’s go!!!
Both these guys are studs I promise you they will see each other again think of this as the bantamweight version of Mcgregor vs Holloway they’ll be running the division in a couple of years.
Didn’t really follow this guy before but that was a great post fight interview! I will follow him now
So was it due to a leg check or prior injury or his leg just gave out outta no where?
The idiot suga show
Work before acting cocky you donkey
Terrible way to win.
O malley fans mad asf
If Sean kick Dc’s eye.There will be a broken leg.
What a plot twist. I mean ankle twist. I mean 🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
Hit us wit that Joey Diaz
And the human trash has been taken out. If that "injury" is real I don't have to see or hear anything about that dude for the next 6-8 months. Thank you sir for those super necessary elbows down there.
Wishing O Malley a speedy recovery, 1 loss isn’t bad! Congrats to Chito.
People in the comments not even watching the fights just see the interview and form an opinion idiots
Chito eres un ÍDOLO igual que BARCELONA en Ecuador bendiciones eres la persona que gracias a tus victorias le das alegría a este pueblo que está golpeado por el virus y todos estos ladrones del gobierno que nos están terminando de matar 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Blame it on the cankles😂😂
I thought herb stopped the fight too soon
Dc got robbed
“Immigrant  mentality “ fuck yeah 😎 you know he’s a jre fan for that lmao 😂
Daniel "WatEr WAter WATeR" Cormier
No excuses baby. Let’s go Chito.
Chamaev was looking damn ahaha
I really hate how Vera and his fans are acting like he destroyed sean. Sean rolled his ankle and fell and herb should of stopped it right there. Stop discrediting sean for this. Hes still super talented and will come back better.
Don’t forget... Sean said he could beat Conor Mcgregor 😂
My mans broke his own ankles in the the middle of a fight, lol mighta toked too much b4 this fight fam 🙏
People acting like O malley got out classed he was winning and hurt his ankle relax he’ll be back
Sugar Sean Rolls his ankle and y'all acting like he got knocked out lmao wishful thinking ya bums
Yeah but imagine being that happy when you didn’t actually beat someone lmao
Marlon  Vera is OG huge respect
I did not plan on enjoying this interview so much, replayed it like twice
Don’t know what was worse his hair or his Performance
"Sean O' Malley was never my friend."- O' Malley's Foot.
Noob Seandogmalley
Hope suga has a fast recovery
What a shit fight. I'm beyond disappointed.
sean got them pretzel bones.
Good Fight, respect to Chito BUT you can’t really be satisfied with this TKO/win Sean obviously hurt his own ankle again and I wish the best for him and his carerr sucks to see a fighter like that injured, takes away from the UFC.  Chito against a top 10 next
Chito Vera must be in UFC 4!!! Congrats Chito! !
Welcome to Shitty Show.
wanna be connor put to rest 🙏
This kid needed 2 be humbled
That fight was weak as hell. Definitely need a rematch....Sean injured himself and was done after that and had to fall down on his own which caused the loss tonight. Vera did nothing impressive either. Too short of a fight to say much of anything.
People ignoring Sean going out from those elbows, has to feel so good for Vera.
Some people don’t like him or do but we can all agree it wasn’t cheeto but it was omalleys foot that got him fucked in that fight. I mean before that his kicks were sending marlon flying
Weak ass foot
I knew he would win
Stipe has his payback literally blinding DC with an eye poke  Sean “Sugar” Omyleg
Congrats to Chito. Rip the O malley hype train
Just to let you know Cormier vs Stipe ended by decision for Stipe #andstill❤️
Jesus Loves You
Won big money tday
Sean's right leg is fragile and probably forever compromised. Plus after that nasty ground elbow Chito landed, Sean wanted no more in that fight. Hype Train derailed, Chito  prevailed! Congrats man
Well, Sean used a controller to play an FPS on a gaming PC.... So, not gonna lie, he deserved that L.
Why is no one talking abt his ankle injury?
This was a lame fight Sean hurting his foot then he went to the grown wanting to show what he has on the ground but didn’t happen 😪congrats to chito though
Judging by the comments it seems nobody actually saw what happened in the fight 🤣
Chito was running his mouth like he KO Sean clean.Sean was injured and Chito probably had nothing to do with it.I am not saying he shouldnt be happy he won but beating an injured guy doesnt make you a badass.Chito was talking like he was the best fighter in the world after beating Sean.  There should be a rematch.People complain Sean is too cocky well Chito lost my respect in this fight.
Lmao people talking like Chito knocked him out  Calm down, Suga got injured from an awkward step.
wtf these guys didn't watch the fight? O'malley was picking him a part before he hurt himself, Chito literally was gifted that victory
Sean needs to switch his diet , he gets hurt a bit , like not hating on vegans but he do get hurt a bit
All the O Malley fan girls salty 😂😂 blaming the leg and then also blaming herb for the “ early” stoppage. Get over it you snowflakes the hype train has been derailed 😂
Hope Herb stopped that because of O'Malley's injury & not that he thought the elbow legit shook him because O'Malley was defending himself perfectly after it.
It's funny reading these hate comments on Sean. Its like they didn't watch the fight.   Also saying that Chito looked good before Sean hurt himself.  I hope Sean recovers well and they can rematch cuz Chito looked great.
Vera acting like he KO'd O'Malley lmao. Not sure he hit him once pre leg injury.
Suga turned out to be DIABETES .
O’malley should’ve spend the time training instead of trash talking#derailed
Congrats but Sean will get back in there an Knock his ass out wait on it
Dan hardy making a fuss about herb's stoppage affected this one
Calf kick
Oh wow definatly made a fan out of me  40 secs in the first round damn
O’Malley is still undefeated, you know this.
O’Malley will be back. Best believe
se lesiono solo, pero se lo merecia, por alardear tanto
I dont give a f**k with the fights, i just happy that Joe Rogan is back ladies and gentleman
Beast haha
Clown Suga after get his ass kick badly by Chito : My foot was a baloonn
welcome to the Chito show
オマリー期待してたのにな。初黒星。
karma got his ass lol
And all the omalley fans switch up😂😂 im still rooting for him tho.
Hype train got shutdown
GOD ROGAN
Hell yeah great job Vera.. O'Malley needed to be knocked down a few levels and humble himself.. especially dying his hair color the same color as the Colombian flag to mess with Vera.. Well Vera got the win..
Chito con trabajo y humildad acabó con su rival, toma eso Suga!!!!, Ja ja ja ja  Grande Chito Vera
nothing wrong with that. Good on him. respectful dude.
So sad for DC
That ELBOWS !! DAMNN !!!
hype train derailed  inject it in my vein  💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Those who saying early stoppage , come one , omally couldn't even stand
Chito!!! 🇪🇨☝️✊🤘👊🙏🤙
I’m a fan of Sean but I ain’t dumb chito won the fight give him some credit Sean will be back
Hype is over 👀👀👀
God the comments are amazing
At least he didnt leave the octagon like crybaby dc lol
Another hype train derailed. Chimaev should watch his words too.
I feel horrible for sean poor guy
The suga must of been too sweet
Funny how many Suga haters are in these comments right now.. he’s a confident kid who believes in himself so what if he got hurt and lost
Chito vs Merab. Make it happen
what a cool guy.  I'm a fan of marlon.  humble, not cocky like "the suga show".  Glad O'malley ate some humble pie tonight.  He'll be back, but fuck yes.
Humbled the stickbug from Montana, them face tattoos ain't so fitting now when the cocky bastard injures himself and proceeds to get smeshed
Gandhi: 'An eye for an eye makes the world blind' Stipe: "Hell yeah!"
Sweet and Low, Sean O Malley .... what a hype job!
Suga will probably say his foot was a balloon.
Somebody needed to humble this guy,I'm glad Chito did it.
Congrats to Chito, RIP the Suga Show
What a joke. This guy is acting like he took O'Malley to school and beat him badly, when in reality Chito's opponent became unable to fight almost immediately when out of nowhere his ankle went belly up on him through no fault of Chito's. In a scenario like this, anything more than a "it is what it is" kind of reaction makes you look like a complete tool.
Suga loses his first fight against a veteran. Back to steroids I guess
Lmao, he hit us with that Joey Diaz immigrant mentality. I don’t care what people thought of that fight or how it turned out, but Chito won me over with that post fight interview.
Finally O'Malley got that big head popped he can fake an injury all he wants he got his ass beat plain and simple he knew chito was better
run that back, Chito had it too easy to me
So glad he won.... Suga needed that humble pie
Johnny Depp brother got the W tonight.
I’m looking for the Suga fans, they have been staying pretty silent since the fight
All you ufc fans love the hype wagons. Sean is a dick and is in love with himself. I'm glad he lost. That's what he gets for being a complete twat
I think Sean needs a better more seasoned coaching team, no offense to the current team but someone needed to bring Sean back down to earth before Chito did
STIPE BABBAYYYEEEE!!!! Also this is bs. O malley would have won this fight
Latinoamerica comtigo chito
Le enseño a ser humilde
Lol 12-1 and under 25 years old, Sean’s gonna be back.
Stipe still champ bois
I TOLD YALL NOT TO SLEEP ON MY BOY CHITO VERA 😎
The Chito Show!!!!
Stipe should be DQ'd for eye poking DC knuckle deep. Absolutely disgusting.
In terms of control pace and control of the action it looked like Sean was gonna pick him apart, he already put him to sleep with the faints. BUT Wins a win lol
Ecuador hijuep*ta
Hype train Derailed 🤣
"youre talking on your podcast on stop being a bitch, and just do it. so i did it. " 😂
Fighters always getting robbed when fighting Song Yadong, first Cody Stamman then Marlon Vera, glad to see Chito get the W
Stipe "eye poker" Miocic   DC eye was completely gone
I called this...  And now the next hype  to fall is Chimaev
Omalley should be back and better bad luck tonight
Dude acting like he did something
Where is the 2 thumbs up?!?!?! I have a daughter with special needs so I completely understand THAT DOG mentality O’Malley has met for the first time tonight!  This dude fights. O’Malley plays . God bless you Chito Vera !!!!!
Was rooting for Suga but Chito is a solid guy and fighter.
I am very happy he humble sugar
Congrats to Herb Dean for another poor stoppage!
bien por chito, mi respetos para chito tapando bocas, le cerro el ogete a ese payaso!!! bonito le quedo el pelo de color amarillo azul y rojo a O'malley por fanfarron y subestimar al ecuatoriano. GRANDE CHITO
Here before Sugas fan start making excuse
''My foot was a baloon''
Sean "Salt" O'malley
SugaTrain derailed😂😂😂
The Suga Show has been taken off the air until further notice
"My foot was a balloon" -Sean O'malley
lets be real if it wasnt for the leg sean would win 10/10 times
They gave Marlon no promotion for this fight. They only gave Sean attention and now the train is derailed
Dman I knew o’mally was overrated
"HAAA HAAA" Cody Garbrandt to O'malley
The Latino/Hispanic(aka Bad Hombre), Marlon Vera killed the great white hope! 🖕🏼 #immagrantmentality
Marlon "I have the immigrant mentality" Vera
Welp!! There goes the O'malley's hype.
Haha.  Suga is always limpin around and hurting his foot whenever he feels the fight slipping away.
Sean „my foot was a balloon“ o‘malley
Grande chito, accidente o no esto es un nivel profesional y tienes que saber como mover tu cuerpo, se lesiono practicamente solo y chito le aplico el respeto latino para que se calle, ahora que se pinte el pelo del color de los pendejos GRANDE CHITO 👆💪👏
Stipe dominated DC
Marlon Vera looks like a mini Boyka.
Hell yeah Joe you ARE a great role model.
Damn after hearing chito talk I can’t wait to see him back in the octagon
Tin Can Sean O'malley got finished by an unranked fighter and he thinks he can beat Garbrandt and McGregor lmfaoo
Well I guess the hype is over
Hell yeah put the hype train to rest !
Suga : I wanna be bigger than Connor Chito : not with that hairstyle
Fin del invicto gano chito
Chito is for real, I had a feeling this wasnt going to be a easy fight for Sean, hope his foot injury isnt that bad so he can bounce back
rolled and smoked
yeaa chitoo💪🏼
Stipe won hell of a fight
Damn that's tough to see sean like that man chito vera real deal
HYPE TRAIN DERAILED!  next train to go is Chamiev
135,000$$$ night!!!! Congrats chito!
O'Malley should have used his spinning techniques
Wow! Good for him👍
He'll be a better fighter after this. Hopefully. Hopefully he'll be less cocky.
Oh well
Lmfao...get Sugar that Conor fight
That was the biggest crock I’ve ever seen. O’Malley breaks his ankle and STILL dominates until Vera gets lucky and trips him. And then to top it off, Herb Dean calls it early! Gotta love Joe slightly calling Vera out for his bullshit though. “I checked the kick” no you didn’t you git. Run this shit back, and retire Herb Dean
