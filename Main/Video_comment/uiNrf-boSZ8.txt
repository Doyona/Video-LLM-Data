Love the fiancé ❤ great man
The first bride and her fiancé I’m sure are still happily married because that’s top-notch communication and consideration of each other they have a beautiful foundation I hope the wedding was equally beautiful
i love the first dress she tried on
The first dress was so beautiful and perfect for the bride
It's not the fashionista sister's wedding it's the cowgirl sister's wedding, she should be able to chose the dress she wants and likes. I like the fact that the consultant said it's the cowgirl's wedding she'll take her into consideration.
Katie got sabotaged by her sis. That first dress was flawless.
That sister does not look stylish at all
The 1st dress was gorgeous! Clean cut & simple ❤
I’m sorry but there is nothing “high fashion” or “fashionista” about the sister😂 glad she at least got over her own vision for what she had for the bride and agreed to the final choice.
If it goes around your mouth twice, it fits. This is for the sister
Bruh the cowgirl bride could be a model omg how beautiful 🤚
We are taking about $387 and all those people she  brought couldn't give her the money and had to go to her husband... She should elope! Her family is unsupportive
Gurantee sister wants her man Small towns not as many around
Have to ask for permission to purchase the dress???
Why does everyone say corsette?  The correct pronunciation is corset.
She looks great in the dress she chose, but she need white cowboy boots.
Sister has mo fashion sense....she's dumpy
Fashionista my butt!  Opinionated and negative.
Sorry, but with the pushy sister egging her on and not helping her stay within her budget,  she should make up the difference!!! It's because if her pushyiness that the bride ended up with a more expensive dress!!!
Was the definition of fashionista different back then?
Loved that Katie called her fiancé to clear going over budget!! Loved the fiancé's answer too!!
Katie, your husband is a keeper!!!❤
So over the farm gir,l cowboy boot fad, how better to ruin wedding dress, put them  for the dancing. been to three wedding with this and every bride catches the lovely hem of her dress on her boots.
I get that she wants to please everyone, but it’s the BRIDE’S day and dress, not the sister’s! Katie is paying for the gown and she has the only opinion that counts!
If I were buying 7 acres I would get married in something I already own.
I hate that she called him to ask about spending "her" money.
So glad to see a sibling not fucking getting in the way of her sister's choices...
The sister is full of herself. A good stylist considers the needs and desires of a client. And her fake cowboy look....SMH.
You should NEVER show a dress over budget!
Her fiancé is literally SO SWEET!!! LOVE THEM!!!
Sorry sister you’re not the fashionista you’re made out to be or that you are in your own mind. Let your sister make the pic just sit down so you don’t hurt yourself. And I would’ve made the sister pay the difference if she loved the dress and she should’ve offered up the difference so the sister wouldn’t have had to put the extra towards it the cost of being a fashionista, huh?
That fiancé is a walking green flag.
‘It’ll be perfect when she loses the weight”.   Giiirl, she’s perfect now!
The first dress was gorgeous  and being a wild child fashionista as she claimed, her sister had a problem with low neckline? Jealousy it is
And this, this is how you adult. You looked stunning Katie.
The sister claims to be a "fashionista" but looks like she begs for change at the gas station, smell and all.
Sister doesn't dress very fashionable
Sorry but not liking the fashionistas’ Woody Allen look or her advice!
I love how he was like “I bought a dirt bike so you go ahead and get that dress” 😂 love it haha
The sister doesn’t look like fashionista to me. I find her outfit VERY plain! 😝
I thought the first 3 halter ones looked best on her
"Fashionista"? And dresses like that? A hat and too much "jewelry" does not a fashionista make. No.
Since she kept nixing all the dresses the bride loved the sister should have said, “I’ll help you cover the difference”.
The sister has no taste and is not any kind of fashionista. The first dress was perfection.
Little sister needs to shut the eff up. It's not her wedding.
What a sweet man🥹
first episode where i love everyone including the fiancé. such a good family
They lied her sister is not a fashionista. The first dress was clean and elegant and made her look statuesque
Every dress looked good on her 🎉 happy for her
The consultant was way too focused on pleasing the sister and then pulls over budget dresses. Poor bride.
I would’ve thought she would want something lacy and more free flowing. I wouldn’t have thought satin for a cowboy bride.
Fashionista sister, with that stupid hat? Gtfooh.
She is living my dream life
I loved the first dress on her, she looked like a queen.
I would be so mad at that consultant for pulling a dress that was outside of my budget after I told her what my absolute max was. if she doesn't go speak to her manager and get the price to match my budget she should never bring that dress to me. Its about the principle and not everyone can afford an extra $400, plus tax, and alterations.
I wonder if the fiance consulted Katie before getting his dirt bike.... I hope he did. Katie seems so kind.
Lmao she might be a country fashonesta but she wouldn't cut it in the big city looking like a hobo
Sorry but with the sister insisting on her tastes dominating, couldn't she have forked out a few hundred dollars? If my sister was such a big mouth brat, I'd have put the pinch on her or shut her down.
I love this bride's attitude. I think should could have rocked a pair of white jeans on wedding day!
Sister: I think it looks trashy. Me: And I think you need soap👆
Gosh how does the sister call herself fashionable in that outfit🤢
Fashionista ? Where ? That hat ?  Trashy fashy
I'd be a wreck knowing I'd have to continue losing weight before my wedding.  It's stressful enough having to plan a wedding so having to lose weight on top of that can sometimes be impossible.
What a painful sister.😮
Bride #1–dress #1
What I want to know is... what do they do when they find out the alterations are $500? Veil, headpiece, etc?  These girls have no idea about the extras!
Bride #2 ❤❤❤
A farmer tend not to overspend on clothing. However, farming is hard. Considering it's $400 overbudget, she should get the dress and cut elsewhere.
this is like 2010 but the sisters outfit is ridiculous and they call her high fashion
P
Her sisters outfit is trash!!!
Ohhh her fiance made me tear up, reminds me of my husband. That's sweet country boys for you
I like how the bride said it's going to be a small wedding of 100 people lmao but I was like well they're probably both from farming families and those tend to be huge (I say this from firsthand experience, my mom's side are from a farming background and there's a ton of them lmao I meet more cousins every time I go to a family reunion)
Beautiful dress, perfect on her.
Understanding fiance😊
What a loving and supportive fiance I'm really happy for her. :) she looks so beautiful in it and im sure the fiance will be left breathless when he see her walk down the aisle
Her sister is jealous thats the only reason she's acting that way
i loved the first dress
I don’t know what kind of fationista rejects the first dress
I love her fiancé and how supportive he was and I especially love the comment “If I can get my dirt bike you should be able to get your dress”
Nice but 2887 usd including tax or not ?
Sis is Stylish ? She’s dressed like Taylor swifts red era 😂
Sister should pitch in the extra $. Or keep her damn mouth shut.
Ok but him on the phone! So cute 🎉
kinda shitty that they put her in it with the whole works THEN tell her the price and not consider that emotional manipulation.
Wear a suit
If I were the sister, I would have paid the difference, and that would have been my contribution as a gift. It would make me proud to have contributed to my sister's dream dress that she so clearly loved.
Little sister needs to put her money where her mouth is and pony up the difference.
I love the 1st dress. It's so sophisticated and classy
Bravo les filles. Félicitations 😊❤🎉
"It's gonna be hard making both sisters equally happy" why do they need to be equally happy...? one is the bride and one is not...
The sister is delusional if she thinks she's a fashionista!🙄
The sister’s dressed like Six from Blossom
That communication between the bride and her groom is so nice to see! Open communication, and he was so excited for her to find a great dress ❤
Why do they keep saying Fashionista or high fashion sister? Her outfit is ridiculous! Looks like a teenager trying too hard on a 30 year old 🙄
The decision should be up to the BRIDE.  It's her dress, NOT THE SISTER'S
Why do they always always add a belt?!
Good grief. It’s not her sisters wedding. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I know it’s a scripted show though. I don’t know why I got sucked into it.😂
Nothing about the sister says stylish or high fashion. IMO
All those opinions from her sister and she couldn't have given her the $300 difference in the dress
Sister and family should have chipped in since they were so insistent on a different style
Liked the first one better ❤ idk why sisters need to interfere 😮‍💨
What her sister keeps doing with her nose?
A noiva escolhe, o grupo apóia!
The dress is gorgeous and he fiancé sounds wonderful!…like the man I married 33 years ago! Who needs to please the sister…not her wedding!
The Bride calling her fiancé sounds like me and my partner. Trade dirt bike for something nerd related and it's us! lol
I hope Katie and her husband are doing well. They seemed so considerate of each other.
Very happy for her !
First dress looked awsome on her❤
Is this sister Klair from Schitt’s Creek?
The fashionista/big city sister had no fashion sense. That first dress was so classy.. The bride was so simple and beautiful ..
The 1st dress was very pretty on her but im glad her fiance was so supportive about her buying the dress she ended up loving.
The first dress was STUNNING. The fiancé seemed so sweet. The” fashionista” sister…  her hat didn’t flatter the shape of her face.
Yes!!! That's the way a marriage is supposed to be , communication and compromise. Congratulations. You two are going to be blessed.
Love the finance's response!
the sister makes faces, not very elegant and classy for someone in fashion. Perhaps it is the American way of fashion, however I doubt it when I see Tom Ford, he is very refined.
The fashionista sister's opinion is clearly not needed here
I love first dress on her
The consultant was really good, all the dresses she pulled looks beautiful on her bride, considering the low budget dress.
Wears a hat- "Im a fashionista" 🤠
I thought that first dress was elegant and beautiful
Loved thatvthe fiancee told her to get the dress!!  To me, it  just shows thay he supports ger completely and wants her to be happy!!
Why is it that there's always 1 "fashionista" in every entourage that thinks that they know everything about fashion abd completely disregards what the BRIDE ACTUALLY WANTS!! After all, SHE'S THE ONE WEARING THE DRESS!!!
Woman has her own farm.. I'm about to turn 30 and don't even have a driver's licence yet 😆
I mean it’s so sweet of her fiancé, but come on.. fashionista…mom and friends there can’t chip in 300 dollars 😂
“Cowboy bride” or maybe a Cowgirl
Why the mom and sister dont suggest to pay the extra?!
If she is my sister, i dont mind spending 500 additional cost for the dress.. i could say thats a selfish family..
I don't think her sister is quite the fashionista she thinks she is...
fiance is SUCH a sweetheart!! sounds like a very happy marriage to come. wishing them the best!
the fiance is the only other person who should ever be saying what the consultant said about "it's not too much above your budget." that was out of line.
The second bride looked sooo great in her dress!
Her fiancé clearly has the right priorities. He cares more about how she feels than controlling her decisions. The fact that they both have that amount of respect for each other to talk about any financial decisions like adults and are willing to be fair to each other shows that they'll make it.
Does only one side of the sister's face work? Because clearly only one side of her brain is working, just like her opinion.
BUDGET $2,500!!! Bride said she's paying for it, and wants to stick to THE budget. Why would the sales rep bring her a dress way above it?! I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THIS. It's a blatant disrespect, and unprofessional all the way around.
Wait..hooow is her sister some big city fashion girl. She's wearing a terrible hat her hair looks like it was caught in a rain and wind storm, and she's wearing a shirt that has a red and white boat anchor like she just went shopping at TJ Maxx. So stupid
I think its so respectful of her to ask. If its her money.
Don't ever bring an entourage!  They can and always be delusional! And quir saying like you bunch of airheads!
All of these people are delusional!
he first one was wsy better than all
why don’t they (seller) want to negociate ? I bought one with a price tag of 2850 and I paid 2000 + tx
Welcome to another episode of “It’s not your wedding”. Hey sis, why don’t YOU pay the price difference? I would have.
Who wedding your sisters of yours
Why is finding a dress that HER SISTER likes a consideration at all???
The first one was beautiful on her
Dress #1 was absolutely spot on!!!
Why didn’t her other or sister offer to pay the extra money?
First of all its not a house or anything that you use together purchase. If I'm making my own money I'll spend it on my own dress how I want. Why the heck do women feel that they need to ask permission?
why people wearing the worst clothes obviously not having any style are always stylists? How? Who is paying them?
Her sister doesn't even have good style. I know this is a clip from an older episode, but she still doesn't have good style.
OMG THE FIANCÉ!!!!! So cute and I love it!!
It’s crazy to me how someone can use the words “jeans” and “comfortable” in the same sentence
I wonder if man ever worry about their outfit and lose weight to look better, probably not.
Every time there’s a fashionista in the group they got on the most stank ass outfit 😂
Why do the consultants constantly upsell?  Always going over budget.  Very disrepectful.
I was disappointed her mother did not defend her daughter to the critical sister.
The bride is a natural beauty and the sister probably went into fashion to talk down to her hard working sister - pretentious and vacuous.
The sister was sandbagging everything in order to springboard her stylist career. She couldn’t care less what her sister wanted. 🙄 Lucky she has a kind hearted fiancé.
The first dress was the best and the bride ended up with the worst and overpriced dress 😢
Katie is so beautiful...is she without makeup!!?  So natural...so beautiful!
I love the satin on her! What a pretty lady! The off the shoulder pleats wow! Why couldn’t the family chip in?
What’s wrong with the family that the mum and sister don’t immediately step up and offer to cover the difference???
FASHIONISTA sister and what she is wearing................... He didn't agree He said you love it you should have it. he got his dirt bike. Please do not over emphasise he said OK It was his support that she wanted Love the cameo broach on the consultants roll neck jumper
I thought she looks great in dress 2
What a shocker they chose the one that's "slightly over budget"
Love the fiancé’s attitude!  He was super considerate.    That marriage has a REALLY good chance for longevity because there is consideration / compromise on both sides!  💕🤞🏽💕
it's always the people who claim to be fashionistas who have an ugly af style
no offense but for someone whose 'high fashion' what she's wearing looked thrown on. /;
I /loved/ that first dress! It was perfect!
The second I see a hat like that I know they aren’t really going to be stylish
Why is the bride trying to satisfy her Sister? Who's wedding is it?
The dress she chose was perfect for her! But honestly, she looked amazing in every one of the dresses she tried on 😁👍
What a good fiancee
Well personally if my sister was dressed like hers she sure wouldn't be helping me pick out my wedding dress!! She needs to burn the hat and boots!! But as for the dress she was gorgeous in it 😊😊
I watched this episode when it aired on tv which was yearsss ago. I thought damn her sis is 'stylish' HELL NA. now rewatching it and reevaluating, I STILL FEEL THE SAME. Her sis commented 'trashy' says the person who is wearing a fake chanel sweater..
👑👑🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾🖤🖤💜💜🧡🧡❤❤✌🏾✌🏾
I love that the bride consulted her fiance. This shows respect and trust on both sides. Big expenses should be discussed together.
The sister was right about the first dress. Meh. She just wanted her sister to look amazing and she did.
OK NYC, Katie is a farmer not a cowgirl. There’s a big difference.
What a lovely couple
The bride has like a model body I mean she literally looks stunning in everything 😍 and the fiancé is so sweet
I know that these episodes are old, but I honestly don't recall ANY DECADE when what her sister is wearing would be considered "stylish".
What the heck she is like ok we need to stick to what the bride wants, but thinking with an evil laugh😏🤫🤭😈👹 who cares about the  budget she wants to stay at, let's purposely find a dress over her budget and make her fall in love with that one ha ha ha😈
The dress you chose is certainly beautiful, and looks great on her, but I think that first satin dress was just as good and was in her price range.
3:06  Dress #2 was so pretty.  I don't know why no one liked that one. Lovely.
Her big sister is stylish?  I never would have guessed.
First dress was a winner! 🙌🏻
I love the fiance ❤❤❤ I really thought the family would pitch in for her.
The dress was perfection on her!
I went wedding shopping by myself……all of those opinions would drive me crazy…..you know when you look nice or not….
How come her mom.isnt chipping in anything ???
Love the first one
$2500 vs $2800.... And you walk away?? Its only $300 like drop something else stupid from the wedding and get the dress!
Wearing hat indoors is a faux-pas and there is nothing about the sister that screams fashion.
Try sitting on those buttons!!! 🤣 Off the shoulder can slip just like strapless can 😂
❤❤❤
Fashionista sister? Come on. The first dress was so classy.
The dress the first bride chose did nothing for her, it looked like she wrapped herself in a white sheet.
He said  "your money and our money"...he is a keeper.
Gorgeous dress & cowgirl
Her sister needs to stop with turning down the dresses it's not her choice it is Katie's dress
They ruined the last dress with the stupid belt?! They do this all the time!!!
He’s a keeper!
What was the lady talking about on the last Bride's dress ? The strapless version of sweetheart shows off everything you don't want to see.... We're so 10 years over it....
The first bride had a nice figure in almost every dress but I couldn't see every dress in a field. My fav was the second one ,it does a bit more prairie pioneer something with the A-line,I wanted to see that one with a bit of sleeves and dressed up. Mermaid was too city. Strapless is unnecessary. The last one did nothing for her.
she’s a farmer not a cowboy lol
Strapless timeless? When was this made?
What a nice fiance! But couldn’t her family have kicked in the extra $300?
the sister is over doing it
That hat in the middle of a bridal place is like wearing sunglasses in a mall
Katy has beautiful hair. Loved her final pick. She looked amazing.
The second bride looks beautiful I don't get the whole diet thing.
google says average price of a dirt bike is 8-9k. So Yea!! Get the dress!!!
Great show Jillian is an amazing consultant! She looked perfect in the dress she picked. The couple is adorable! Love that her sister desires her sister to find her perfect dress great episode!
I love that dress!
To the sister corset back in dresses does not look trashy I had one and it was not trashy looking.
The sister is a fashionista?  Like for middle-schoolers?  The bride has a better sense of style.
I burst into tears when I heard him tell her, "If it's your dream dress, BUY IT!"! He probably won't get many other chances to say that to his love throughout the marriage. 💞
The dress is beautiful get it
Come on yes to.the dress u do know u made a typo u put cowboy instead of cowgirl 😂?
With all those dresses, I'm sure there was one for Katie under her budget. They're always up-selling. Hope she can find some white  satin flats instead of boots.
I love that the FIRST thing the consultant did was remind the group that it's about what the -bride- wants.
Sorry! Not keen on all the "wrinkles" or creases of the dress she chose.
The  fiancé’ is wonderful ! No hesitation ; he wanted her to have her dream dress.
I love the fiancé! He said “I spend on what I want if it’s your dream dress get it❤️❤️❤️” No hesitation at all. Yes it was over budget but not crazy❤️❤️ Congratulations!!
her fiancé is so sweet 🫶🏻
Fashionista???? Look in the mirror. The hat????
What a sweet fiancé!!!!
She is hands down my favorite ever on this show! 🤠
No 😮está bonito estaban mejor los anteriores🤯😳😵‍💫🏐🤕🤕
It's the bride's dress, and the couple's wedding, When is the family or the sister going to realize it's not their wedding.
Is your  sister  buying the dress  It is your day .
The sister isnt going to wea the dress. She also needs to learn how to wear a hat. Lily Dache, where are you?
I’m the first here. Please show some love 😂. A bride should get what she loves
I’m the first here. Please show some love 😂. A bride should get what she loves
