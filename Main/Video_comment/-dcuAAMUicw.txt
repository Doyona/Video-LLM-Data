FreezeFlame22 is a very underrated youtuber
tony zaret's an insane pick
I don´t like that you put creators that do shorts, this is youtube, it was born in a horizontal format not a vertical and short format
I NOW REMEMBER WHERE I FOUND OUT ABOUT RANTON THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE SHOUTED HIM OUT
Where the hell is defunctland at the top of this iceberg
Omg i saw the thumbnail without who made it and was like "wheres jacksfilms?" 😭 😭 😭
JACK!! JACK THATS NOT SCUMBAGDAD!! JOHNFILM!!!!!
this is like the bible part 2
Why am i not even on this iceberg? This is glorpshit
yub
Doktor is NOT good anymore 😭
my youtube crashed as soon as he said “good youtuber”
The first link is wrong. Should be @scumbagdadofficial
Still great!!! ❤
wtf the entire time i was watching i the background music had these big drums but at the end they kept going after the vid was over but then they just randomly stopped and i have no idea where they were from
So happy seeing Dimestore Adventures getting some recognition
Bobby Fingers and Wizards With Guns are literally my two favorite channels
!! TONY ZARET MENTIONED !!
Wheres the genius 1200 word story comment from ICE?
hey i love some of these channels and completely did not expect them to be featured in a jackfilms episode
WHERE OFFICAL CHUU
0:25 the purple one is a very good lump
Lumpytouch😊
Vomitsaw is pretty good - too bad he is only really known for the Nintoaster video 😕
I highly recommend Atun-Shei Films.
It’s easy to click away from a Skipper video when he does a negative amount of research on his subject.
Do another!!
Dime store adventures is so good! It’s nuts how in-depth they can get without being overstimulating or feeling like it’s dragging.
THEY DO NOT KNOW about UNDERDOGS GAMING, the channel with the deepest lore of inside jokes where it’s nigh impossible to get new viewers
3:41 Mancarrying thing mentioned :DD love his content
Pc rehab is a personal favorite channel of mine 😊
CAPTAIN D!
Videogamedunkey
you featured value select, but where’s jazz emu?
Tony Zaret the GOAT
Wozniac?
WHERE IS ADRIAN GRAY COMEDY OR SKYCORP HOME VIDEO
Now make the good farts iceberg
Bobby fingers is amazing
How do you find these?
3:45 does that say NSFW Al Gore (the politician) or NSFW AI (artificial intelligence) Gore?
Captain Disillusion would like to have a word with you.
hmmm, this video is fake news 🧐, I'm not in the iceberg
right after this video was made dr skipper made a vid about godzilla that genuinely inspired more discourse then gxk because of how bad it was
Youtube has changed so much since I was a kid I'm so happy to see how creative creators have gotten
Take a shot every time he says “They” or “Their” 😂
Needs to have @EthanChlebowski youtube.com/@EthanChlebowski and @ChineseCookingDemystified youtube.com/@ChineseCookingDemystified for quality cooking content (not sponsored)   (I have 1 million subscribers, so my opinion is valid)
Subjective
This is such an awesome return to form to when you used to shout out channels at the end of all your videos back of the day
6:22 What a nice man. I wonder what he thinks of the Godzilla series.
Man Carrying Thing is one of my favourite creators this decade, glad to see you shouted him out and got him some attention. This vid in general is great, shame I just now caught up
Daniel Krafft Sticks
Mrmobile baby back when phone area had great staff
Better health again 😅
6:22 well that aged horribly
You forgot Sssniperwolf
absolutely love lumpy touch and man carrying thing, they're both great
I watched a few tony zaret videos. I feel like his content is supposed to be a satire of the post ironic culture of the internet by pushing it so far you're in a trance of what is and isn't
I think defo boop is a good contender for these style of channels , the amount of effort he puts into his videos and how creative they are is insane  Alfaoxtrot is also a very funny channel I’ve followed for ages of a guy who puts loads of effort into his editing
I don't see any good youtubers on there.
Scumbag Dad on here is great to see.
Doing God's work.
make a 5 day long video covering EVERY creator that your viewers think are good and yours as well as a 50 day long video covering the BAD youtubers
oh shit tony zaret!!!! i love that guy
I want to do something like this with music artist
"Youtube iceberg" and not "Youtuberg"? I am disappointed.    But really, good stuff here.
2:43 Well that aged poorly
Yes bobbyfingers is amazing
it is so weird how many of these bottom tier ones i actually recognize
I have been subscribed to reloxard for months now and it makes me so happy to see you giving him an audience. He truly is proof that the art form is still evolving
Where’s sssniperwolf? She’s not there tho,Is it because she’s a successful girl boss? 😢😢
Big Yelow
You should put caddicarus in the next one
Where was coryxkenshin for over 1m subs?
Skip Ranton, this guy gives every single game a 7/10 and his videos get boring after a while
im really disappointed that none of my favorite late night tv hosts are on this iceberg.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS VID, THEIR CONTENT IS SO GOOD, JUST LIKE YOURS, TYSM !!
Wizards with guns are straight up gold!
Where's Scott the Woz tho, he's got fewer subs than most of the surface tubers
Where's BobbyBroccoli tho
Came here based on a recommendation from jacksfilms. Am NOT disappointed.
A sponsor I actually watched
alright heres a great one: Arcus, he's a big man in the ninja gaiden speedrunning community, he has nice and chill laid back commentary, and his coffe & gardening with arcus series is just perfection. we need to get him to 100k subs!
Bold of Jack to imply that he's making good content.🤔
RSK huh? Real Sweet Kids rise up!
So happy that Captain Disillusion is at the tip of the iceberg. I followed that guy when he had like 50k subs, and back then, his content was already INSANELY well-done, and all self-produced.   It took him getting on the H3 Podcast before his channel really exploded. Deserves every bit of it.
Poor jack got black listed & still cant apologize for going at  a youtube creator 😂😂😅
What about me ;(
There i ruined it is AWESOME! More ppl need to know about them lowkey
What’s not cool if you try to drop your channel here he blocks your comments so you can’t even say check out blank blank
Scumbagg dad yessssssss
Has anyone come visit or have you  realize that you're overreacting i can't watch sssniperwolf because of you 🙄
Love to see the Man Carrying Thing love. He’s also like a partial booktuber
Glad to see Bobby Fingers getting his recognition. One of my favorite YouTubers ever since his Mel Gibson diorama lol
Brilliant! I'd been wondering how the hell can I sort through all this garbage to find the hidden gems, why hasn't somebody done something like this - there are so many reaction videos and all kinda stuff like that, but nothing pointing me to what I seek. Then I see this video about some drama between this really lame reaction video maker I'd come across before and this persnickety fellow with a channel called jacksfilms and another one called jjjacksfilms. If sssniperwolf has ever done anything useful, it's that she has brought you to my attention! Thanks for the great work, jaskfilms!!!!! You should p*ss her off a little more as she may bring you to the attention of more bored and dissatisfied YouTube viewers. Hahaha! Perhaps it would be funny if you paid her a token amount per head on all the subscribers brought to you by her attacks on you. I love your channels! Won't be giving her a second view unless I hear she's feuding with another witty content creator.
I think Dankpods is sorely missing from this list
im happy about this i really love there i ruined it and im glad ur helpign all these guys out
Bro forgot me
Thansk for the new content
Im so glad that your recovering from the incident earlier on in october 🫡😔🥺
MAN CARRYING THING
I got an ad 5:49
I got an ad
Where is my boy Paul Davids
Jack is the best antidepressant.
Wizards with guns are genuinely funny guys, glad to see them getting some love
grrr worst iceberg ever add me!!!
Why are you calling everyon " them" its really obvious if they are male or female.
Erm... why am i not on there? i´m literally the best youtuber on the platform.
YouTube won't let us report "her" Channel anymore they took away the report so if we click report it just links us to her homepage
It’s not on here but one of the most underrated channels in my opinion is ck productions, they produce very fun enjoyable videos about games and “logic” videos and they are really good, they only have over 100K subs but they are still really good
Jack in the next. One you need to mention microwave society. The vibe is immaculate.
Can we add Dunkey to this list?
the reference to her during your sponsor lmao 💀
lets go its man carrying thing he never misses absolute legend
Wizards with Guns made it
Where is summoning salt
The lilkurbs and ryuhkar content is endless! Thanks for the support
I've actually been recommended some videos from Man Carrying Thing before. They were good, go watch them!
"Mr. Mobile" (Michael Fisher) is an untrustworthy sell-out. The moment he started getting cosy with OEMs, he became as pathetic and biased as iJustine. Except iJustine never actually pretended that hard that she's unbiased while Michael likes to try to through dust in our eyes.
Greddebates is one of my favourites
Awful list unfortunately
RANTON MENTIONED RAHHHH!!🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💯💯💯🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳 WHAT THE FUCK IS AN ATTENTION SPAN!!!
I fell in love with Tony Zarets channel because of this
One channel I would personally recommend is Umami. They make really good surreal animations based on surrealist art. Their series “Interface” is genuinely amazing but their parody animations are very funny too.
TONY Z MENTIONED!
Number 1: Sssniperwolf
The good samaritan Jack who has the good youtubers iceberg. Knock knock buddy. You see we all have friends and enemies, and trust me in the world people like you try to promote, the enemies are always more in numbers and in passion. You will regret getting into this rabbit hole brother. You will regret.
yo where did you go? I haven’t seen you in a WHILE
I didn’t even see MY good yet unknown creator so he must be even more unknown
Nice!
Where's my boy Jreg at ?
Maybe we can have a dedicated iceberg for wamen YouTubers :)
This video is probably the most poignant in making me want to do YouTube seriously
No Scott the woz detected
Wizards with Guns is one of my favorites ever. I recommend them to every one of my friends. Their pop rocks sketch is one of the funniest videos on the internet.
Why are the surface all mostly white men
under rated youtuber @KeoTsang
its still sad to think that sssniperwolf still makes videos
Can I be in one of the videos
Can I be in one of the videos
Project farm one of the best.
i am just gona enter RN
Where horrible histories
When a content creator is so genuine you actually watch the whole sponsored ad
😁😆💟🖤💯
TONY
Can you please write a song about the difference between Jacobites and Jacobins?
where's tomska?
That why I love YouTube! Since there's so much stuff on here, I keep discovering channels I had never heard of before, even if they have millions of subscribers sometime. That's also why I think your iceberg lacks so many channels (but you can't fit all of YouTube in 10 minutes lol). I LOVE the concept though
Holy shit Tony Zaret the absolute goat of bait
Where’s markiplier 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭📸😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😼😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭📸😭📸😭💀📸😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😼😭😼😭😼😭😭😭😭😭😼😭😼😭😭😭😼😭📸😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭👻😭👻😭👻😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💩😭😭😭😭💩😭💩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💩😭💩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀😭💀😭💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀😭😭💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🇧🇧😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🎉😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
You forgot kurzgezesgt
W video
you forgot jaboody dubs
I feel like you would like Max0r's channel, fairly large with 1.3m subs but based on how you described some of the other channel's videos it seems similar
watching this with 10 hbomberguy videos in my recommended. someone was robbed 😭
I cant seem to find the VOD for the 10 sec clip reaction stream. I couldn't find it on twitch. where could I find it?
Clicked on this video when I saw LilKirbs in the thumbnail, and discovered some cool creators! 🎉
TONY ZARET!!!!
Oh so YOU'RE the one I discovered Wizards With Guns from! I couldn't remember where I first heard of them. 11/10 recommendation!
@SiliconFX should be on this list.
Almost friday tv makes some absolute masterpieces. Absolutely go check them out if you have not.
Gotta love the fact that a random YouTuber pretend to have the absolute truth on who’s good and who’s not. 2024, here we come. The era where YouTube and Instagram is the main website to get informations. People in 2040, you’ll miss this area. What a generation of lunatics is about to take on the world…
I sadly saw this after dec.6 :(
missed the opportunity in making the discount code "JACK_OFF"
I can also vouch for wizards with guns. They're absolutely the most creative and hilarious skit Channel I have ever run into.
Wizards with guns has been one of my favorite channels in the past few months
sv ignore 4:01
Crackermilk is another great one!
I’m sick of her always claiming the victim whether it is calling jack sexist insulting his facial features or giving an apology that’s not really an apology and that is clearly not written by her. When she is accused she can never counter and instead diverts. If you’re still watching her don’t be an NPC unsub and spread the message.
bobby fingers is a genius
thanks for this, love it. Sad that i only know doctor skipper before this...
Glad to see mr. select on the iceberg.   There are few with his mastery of green-screen-no-jutsu on the planet. A talent witnessed at the dawn before time when he was still at the diepest tier of the iceberg. When the value select lifestyle had just been birthed.  Watching him grow from such a small beginning to the tower he is today brings me pride that only a step-father could feel.
heyyyy, my channel wasn’t up here! great video jack!
mystic bubble is a really good and funny channel
I'm so glad Captain Disillusion finally made it. I was subscribed I want to say around when he had 200k, and it was shocking how much effort he had already put into a huge library. He felt like a hidden gem, and then a long while later at some point he finally blew up. He was there from the start making great content, while it took too long, I'm glad the audience finally found him. If anyone is reading this, do take a look at his long backlog of videos. His first videos from SIXTEEN YEARS AGO are even good still.
happy to see forehead guy back to his normal videos after that "scary incident in october"
Bobby fingers is hilarious and terrifying. I would have never thought a channel like that would actually exist. Wow.
Wish I'd known this sooner 😢
Dude, do I just have a really good taste? I know like half of these
I only knew about 1 youtube on this list, so if you could do more of these that would be really swell.
TWO YOUTUBE POOP CHANELS? IN THIS ECONOMY?
Definitely didn't expect to see LilKirbs on here! His stuff is always so good. It's bite-sized (just a few minutes per video) and his hyper-downplayed narration and explanation of the levels he beats is such great humor.
ive been following tony zaret for 4 years now on instagram he hasn't changed
I just found wizards with guns the other day because my sister was cry laughing at their 2000's weed film video looool
It's mad to see Bobby Fingers featured. He was known especially in UK and Ireland for a previous gig he had that is searchable. Very glad he has the space of his own to create the videos he does now.
IMO the bottom of the iceberg is Rabbi Glazerson's channel, if you can include serious educational content.  He used Michael Drosnin's bible code software to find codes in the Hebrew Torah and although it's not funny, he shows how 3300 year old words are clearly proven to talk about current events happening right now. It should scare everyone that a force exits capable of doing this. Decided to investigate the software myself and found 2 codes in KJV which are up on my Rumble channel.  We're in a time it's more important than ever. Well, if you don't get it now maybe after 12.14.23 you will.
This is a great video jack! As a mario maker nerd though I have to say I got annoyed when you called lilkirbs the best player in the world lol, there is a whole community of people who constantly push the difficulty limits and considering how hard levels get he isn’t even one of the best. The hardest level of all time is Trials of Death, which took the creator 7 years of attempts to beat, and the hardest in the second game is chocolate speedrun v5 by a japanese creator. This is somewhat just me nitpicking and your introduction to kirbs is good but kinda suggests that there’s nothing higher in difficulty than what kirbs does which might disinterest people in the deeper SMM community
Boring Af 🤣🤣
a great channel that has somewhat similar yet still unique content to value select is jazzemu
Jack you're a king for this
How could you forget me, I am officially the best channel on Youtube
Watch brahkie. Shes blowing up
I hope I make the list next year.
Been a Bobby fingers sub for a good couple months, cannot recommend enough. Get in on Bobby fingers
You need to add Chris and Jack to this.
It’s so cool seeing other people like wizards with guns as much as me, this a awesome
I feel like this video is not gonna age well! (But it’s still a wonderful idea regardlsss)
What happened to jacks petty arc this is wholesome asf
Where's NileRed
It has been so long since I watched Jacksfilms I didn't realize  this was him until I listened for a bit
I’ve never heard of any of these channels.
I'm glad there's still appreciation for Youtube Poops out there. Some people call it a thing of the past but I still find myself searching new YTPs from time to time and enjoying my time watching them. It's just silly fun in its most honest form, that old spirit of the platform that shouldn't go away.
I am so happy you mentioned dimestore adventures
Friendlyjordies should be on the list for the Chronicles of Yilmaz. A series from 8 years ago lol
Wizards with Guns is underrated af. I wish that they got more recognition for their work
I like this subversion of the algorithm by giving me recommendations YouTube will not.
you might have good intentions but we all know that overwhelming majority especially youtube algorith does not care about small channels some small channels deserve to be small either from being AI zero effort channel to low effort reddit lets players that in reality are bad people not evil bad cause they are funny word thats starts with a and ends with hole cause everyone is a pro family friendly these days then i want to be total opposite  other small channels are stuck in purgatory but heres the fun part the purgatory can deviate into probably more then two path the first one is they are their own void where they hold back cause they are not satisfied in themselves the other purgatory is where algorithm ignores them  but its a complicated problem cause there are cases where people lose control where even a big channel can fall either from deserved drama or poisoned by being too obsessed to go viral every single time or get attention they didnt wanted or were too ignorant to consequences that finally catched up  success is often rigged like a coin toss where things get interesting then it lands on its edge
why you forgot me
I’m surprised you haven’t made a Iceberg Parody video.
al jokes deserves on here
yooooo WWG mention
kirbs is goated
Henrys Kitchen shoulda been on here ngl
I love this concept but the fact that Lemmino is not in here is a disaster
This is going to be a lightning rod for those "This aged like milk" comments.  Mark my god damned words.
I think alex bale is one of the best unknown film producers on youtube, came for the spongebob theories, stayed for the creepy corporate ARG hivemind, should have 10 million subs for the level of production he has
And Jack hath become this eras Ray William Johnson
Hey jacksfilms. I know someone as big as you wont be seeing this but hopefully by faith i want you to check out this man named "Sideeus" his Minecraft skits is perfect and the thing is he is underrated AS HELL so hopefully youll see this comment and boost this creator. Or not.
I feel like I should have made the list.
Should have titled it the YouTube Shorts iceberg.
Watch cs188
longestsoloever
Man carrying thing mentioned 😳😳😳😳😳
Major omission from this list: Ann Reardon's How to Cook That, it could be a contestant for the absolute best channel on the platform.
Internet Historian is def.  missing. I would also say Tobias Fate (God Tier Editing),
Bro Sssniperwolf is still posting stuff like nothing happened -_-
3:11 - Nice use of the Dubstep Solves Everything 2 Beat
Yeah, I tonyzaret is weird
Late to submit but just wanted to provide you the opportunity to laugh.
I can't wait to feature on the "below 10 - average gamer content" series
Your comment at the end sure made me laugh. "You'll be hearing from my attorney!" XD
Happy to see almost Friday near the top ❤
There are many excellent women creators with over a million subs. Your entire first tier list was all male! I dunno, I just found it very alienating and super surprising coming from this channel.
Finkfishcity is an amazing one to look up.
My dad beat me with a entire magic card deck until I couldn't walk and I had to eat through a straw just because I said mom was the better cook.
Just came to sub, your a solid person and doing right by the community. i always dreaded trying to start a content platform because of all of the bs content thievery. You've given me hope to consider it now realistically. That sniper wolf fiasco is wild. Some of the
Awesome. I approve this message.
I'm a proud Tony Zaret acolyte
Hilarious thing, Lia hasn't uploaded for 12 days.
As a member of your community I think of you as a lovable big forehead, but the wider YouTube audience looks up to you. You’re a veteran so this means a lot to all these creators.
I would add Andrew Rousso. Very funny stuff
Can't wait till all of these creators dox Jack
That headset microphone has more promise when dr disrespect threw a football 70 yards
You seem to like sketch comedy, so here's one for the under 300k club: Chris and Jack. Consistently hilarious, great production quality, also if you liked Avatar The Last Airbender then you may recognize Jack in Chris and Jack as Jack De Sena, voice actor for Sokka. Still don't know why they haven't blown up yet, they deserve so much more
Why are iceberg videos coming back?
I DID A THING is very, very entertaining and honest.
6:09 value select is probably my favorite smaller creator right now, the songs are so good
doktor skipper deserves sm more recognition than he gets man
There's something really pleasant about the way creators rave about their own passions. Hope Jack and other creators make a habit of this sort of content.
Good job, Scumbad Dad deserves more recognition.
Good job man👍
Hey I was subbed to one of the channels... man carrying thing
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION!!!
Thank you for the important highlight on these creators Jack! Really need to shoutout Internet Pitstop, please check out his content. I think it is a severely underestimated channel for the content it puts out
Where is Mr beast??
Dark somnium on the next one!
I think someone who needs a shoutout is FlameIsLucky, his over an hour long documentaries on obscure sports champions have some of the best editing and story telling in a youtube documentary ever.
Do you know magic the noah? u will probs like it
So how do you guys classify people like me that watches vídeos on all of these channels before this vídeos exist?
I recommend @AllThingsOnePlace. He does technical performance reviews of power adapters and chargers. Most tech reviewers only review the outside of adapters without diving into the performance side.  Truly a hidden gem, and I wish more people would watch his reviews to make a better decision when buying power adapters
I love skycorp
REALRANTOOON MENTIONED!! MARTIAL ARTISTTS/MARTIAL ART FANS  WILL FEAST ON THIS RAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
NOOOOOOO!!! I missed it!! On the last day too! 😭 what a missed opportunity!!! I hope you'll do this again, so I'll keep an eye out.
WIZARDS WOTH GUNS MENTIONED!!!
Add Internet Today and Internet Historian to the list too!!
forgot vsauce
Big Money Salvia!
Another one that is criminally underrated is the talk,  "conversations that never happened between two celebrities that never met
Commentiquette bounced on my boys BIG MONEY SALVIA to this video aaaaaaaaaand Post!
I only knew the captain and There I ruined it... The rest, I have no clue...
I’m gonna assume this iceberg was built mainly for youtubers not a lot of people know because it would be really obvious if vsauce, marques brownlee or any other insanely popular good youtubers that everyone knows.
Personal thanks to Ryan Hollinger and RagnarRox you guys rock the indie horror part of youtube.
AlmostFridayTV (the sketch guys) are bound to blow up with the quality and tastefulness of their comedy.
INTERNET!!! COMMENT!!!!ETIQUETTE!!!!!!
i love tony zaret
Surprised you didn’t mention RLM
Scumbag dad being on the iceberg completely ruins the whole iceberg
Ahoy!
He forgot videogamedunkey 😢
Adrian Gray Comedy is also brilliant
L u dont deserve views
Me
ohhh shit I hope it's not too late to submit bruhhhh
rlm
I'm subbed to dime stories!
Another fantastic channel is Foil Arms and Hog. I think they're the funniest people on the planet. They're absolutely lovely people too and tour often! Couldn't recommend them more highly. After 15 years, they're so close to a million subs. If anyone here reads this and goes to check them out, it would absolutely make my day. Otherwise, thanks for reading!
Sniper wolf: below he iceberg
A channel I’d recommend is slavian a YouTuber with over 7 thousand subscribers who does long form edits to military forces such as the Japan Self Defense Force
YES DIME STORE ADVENTURES. Such an underrated channel. Love the dude's enthusiasm
I got recommended wizards with guns a few weeks ago and legit best channel ive subbed to since all those elsagate channels in 2017
Sssniperwolf’s comments are on again
3:55 lmao that gay dream skin war really funny
Shots fired!
What about The Coding Train ? 3blue1brown ? NileRed ?
Well shit
Geekvolution is a smaller (comparatively) YouTube channel I’ve loved for as long as I’ve watched your channel. They have 35k subs and specialize in comic book media content, but also have a weekly Q&A that is always good for introspection and laughter back to back with each other. Definitely worth checking out if you like podcasty style videos
I absolutely love this. You should be the CEO of YouTube at this point. Anyway, I would love to participate in the video submission challenge; unfortunately, I do not have time right now to create a clip so I would just like to ask that you keep doing these submission "challenges" on a somewhat regular basis so I can make it in the next one. Thank you good sir!
You’re awesome dude. I don’t think anyone—even the most profit-brained YouTube corpo—could look at you and Ssssssssssss and not come to the conclusion that you are an angel sent from above, while the other is a greedy content thief
This is so wholesome, I really love the direction your channel's been going lately, Jack! You're fulfilling an important and impactful niche and we appreciate you for it!
You didn't have to release your jack-juice in the first 30 sec...
Kirbs really is the king of Mario maker, and impossible levels.
Bottom of the iceberg is @Dougie Birkner with about 1k subs. He makes very original music and music videos
Ayyy let's go @skycorphomevideo
There's better out there but still ok recs
Joo @Ranton let's goooo
BOO! No science youtubers on your iceberg.
Just seeing this video Dec. 6. xd Would love to see more like this!
Captain disillusion is literally vsause but with mad editing skills
There are plenty more good YouTubers, but they are a bit obscure. For example Junferno for the Tech/Programming people out there.  He's currently at 182k subscribers. And there is AlphaPhoenix for the Physics people out there.  He's currently at 370k subscribers. There is also LiveOverflow for the cyber security people out there.  He's currently at 862k subscribers.
I love your videos bro hahahahaha and scumbag dad is goated
Ay where's Physics Girl?
The remote video from Wizards with Guns made me die, the 360 camera use is brilliant
Pls add wendigoon <3
Thank you so much for giving shutouts to deserving creators out there!! I'm always on the lookout for new interesting channels to sub to but it's not always easy to just stumble upon them. Keep em coming!!!!! 🎉🏆 You also motivated me to work more on my videos
I like how this video wasn't 12 hrs long.
Thank you for Ranton and Doktor Skipper, they are great! Never would've found them without this video.
So mr beast j isnt a good youtuber?
aww no technology connections mention :c his content is so brain itchingly good
Should've included Daily Dose of Internet
Wow Jack looks like Chris from China Uncensored 😂
I thought I saw a certain guy named Rick
Trickle Bickle has three videos now, I think he noticed this.
I'm a goofy goober
https://youtu.be/r9E9suKSw20?si=1jIoGpXk_xh6ehPX
Almost Friday popped up on mine a while back and they give me that old sense of collegehumor when their skits were supposed to be original and relatable
Im disapointed "InfoChammel" didn't make the list, he used to do animations for Adult Swim so you can expect some pretty wacky stuff. All hail Fred Furner.
I love wizards with guns
@NotNowImBusy , is my favourite hidden gem. The Keurig skit kills me everytime. These guys are comedy gold.
This video will go on Lil’ Kirbs wall
I love lil kirbs
Imagine being a channel with 56 subscribers getting a shoutout!
If you make another one of these, check out these channels: Posy - Absolutely insane visuals, grabbed all by the channels creator. You won't find a single piece of stock footage in it. Alex (aka French Guy Cooking) - One of the most entertaining chefs on the platform, and you get to learn about how to make authentic cuisine. BrightSunFilms - Absolutely stellar Documentary channel about times gone by Defunctland - There are theme park news channels, there's theme park nostalgia channels, and then there's Kevin Perjurer making some of the most compelling, entertaining, and informative documentaries on theme parks.
ItsFunneh, and flamingo are good YouTubers.
Use this comment as a space to share all the obscure but wonderful YouTube channels you know about!
Great recommendations made me discover some nice content :p  As a side note I'd say that maybe exurb1a could possibly deserve a spot 👀💧 It's more philosophy than comedy, but his videos tend to still be pretty funny and I've found enjoyable even to people who don't care much for handmade existential crises
I gotta put The Creatures of Yes in the iceberg. It's the Muppets but you woke up from a NyQuil nap and you left the TV on an obscure adult swim show. It's perfect.
And they all do what they do without doxxing anyone 🫠
WWG and almost friday are so incredibly underapreciated, I couldn't believe they were both only at 300k in subs when I found them.
man if I could subscribe to a channel again... Jack, you are youtube heritage and still a legend
@hivemind
You should do quack mode
Wizards with guns is amazing, been following forever and so happy to see them on this
My two most favorite youtuber is 'ManlyBadasshero' and 'Wizard with Gun'.The First one Is my favorite Gaming youtuber with really Great Persona,and the Second one Is  Comedy Skit channel that occasionally make me Laugh my ass of
it brings me great joy that you watch ranton
comment for the algorithm
That 10 second challenge sounds fun. Let me take a crack at it
PLEASE DO MORE PLEASE DO MORE PLEASE DO MORE
i love that you're promoting smaller creators.
Bobby fingers is insane
I almost disliked since Leo Vader wasn’t mentioned
Seeing Tony Zaret on here is amazing lol
John. How dare you not include @bobbybroccoli
Nakeyjakey tho.
I'm really liking this hero arc. Not that you weren't a hero before...you're just doin' so much for the community these days that it kinda makes me wanna cry.
Thank you for this. You're a real one Jack
Nice vid! For me is KaptainKristian that one that makes me stop what im doing when theres a notification of a new video
I really like AFtv
Biased
Ranton is if you took a youtuber from 2016 and told them they now live in Germany. Oh, and that they are also Chinese. Oh and that they are also in love and married to a Russian woman.  Cool shit.
Thanks for the list,  been a long time sub of both Captain disillusion and Internet comment etiquette. The real goat of youtube however (imo) is Internet Historian
Scumbag dad is falling off hard due to the cringe and weird collaborations. He keeps promoting terrible music and pornstars it seems like he’s just flexing his connections at this point.
Thank you for CREDITING them sniperwolf should take notes
I wonder why sniper wolf isnt on here (maybe because she sucks)
i'm so glad i saw scumbagdad immediately, i love this dude
Does Jack dislike Mr. Beast?
Jacksfilms is the worst youtuber ever and needs to be banned
@JazzEmu Needs to be on this list!!
man carrying thing there lets go
No one sits deeper on the iceberg than I. How the top looks so bright and warm.
Wizards with guns just hit 300k!
I LOVE SCUMBAG DAD!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bobby fingers is by far, the most unique and indescribable channel I've ever seen. The man is a genius.
YESSS JACKS CHALLENGE IS SORTA BACK
coffeezilla?
i like this content it gives me more content
Thanks Jack for making this and got some new underrated YouTube channels to watch.
Definitely forgetting Blame Society Films. They’ve been on YouTube since the beginning with Chad Vader. Since then, they’ve been active with board games and films. They also have sister channels Junkyard Joust and Game Society Pimps. The show Beer and Board Games has a dedicated following that initiated FolksCon, an annual gathering of fans and guests of the show.
I'm going to add another channel here that I've recently discovered.  Kitten Arcader has an awesome new series called "Foot the Bill" where he estimates how much money characters in movies (and maybe shows) could spend doing what they do.  The first 2 episodes are on Saw 1 and 2 on how much Jigsaw could have ended up spending on his traps.  They're both awesome.
Pog Kirbs
Yesss love captain disillusion <3
Yeah! Value Select!
Crackermilk
WIZARDS WITH GUNS MENTIONED‼️‼️‼️
qxir is so good https://www.youtube.com/@qxir
Bobby fingers is fantastic!!
its crazy u didnt include smosh, u had a great roast on their channel
BOBBY FINGERS 🎉🎇🎆🎊🍾✨
I'd like to propose a few alternatives to a few on the list with similar content, but different executions: Lumpy - ShortToon MrMobile - MKBHD I guess (not that funny, but imo a bit more thorough) Reloxard - Alternative Cuts  Bobby Fingers was a TREAT however.
The youtube algorithm has been sending me the same crap too much lately.  Than you for this!  I'll check some of these out.
this is all subjective lil bro
Max0r is a fantastic creator IMO. He does these insanely well edited videos on videogames, they're brain melting and make me feel kind of sick after watching them, but they're amazing. I got into him from his Ultrakill series, but his slightly calmer Metal Gear Rising vids are probably my favorites. Also, he got Gianni Matragrano to voice the Ultrakill series (who is Gabriel in the game) and he also has a fantastic voice acting channel. Both of them are some of my favorite content creators.
You did Captain disillusion wrong with that thumbnail. He is so underrated when you relise how much work he puts into every video.
bro missed FUNKe
Wow.... what a HORRIBLY curated list. All of these feel like 2008 YT.
7:50 evanthorizon for history
6:11 jazz emu type
3:50 come on you forgot aljokes
This is a white ass list my guy
Dont forget aljokes
Value Select is soooo fucking good.
showing my support :) keep it up Jack, may God bless you and your family
WIZARDS WITH GUNS MENTIONED, LESSGOOOOO
Tantacrul makes beautiful videos
This is an excellent video! Highlighting smaller channels is a GREAT idea! You sir are one of a kind
It sucks to find out that I'm already subbed to a lot of these youtubers but rarely get shown their videos because AlGoRiThM. Id like to see new uploads by any of my subscribers on my youtube homepage first and then get recommended videos like it used to be, not get recommended completely random videos at the top of my homepage, fucking bullshit
Awww, I love Ekatt, I used to watch her cardistry videos 6/7 years ago <3
Time to begin the grind it seems for starters like me?
If you guys haven't caught on the Australian comedy Singer Tom Cardy, i highly recommend you to go check out his channel  His songs are funny, catchy and are mostly stories about a small episode in his life!
I don’t know anyone, where’s Charlie
For cooking video I recommend "Internet Shaquille" Very educational and funny, in a compact video without any padding.
i see a pattern here..
ayy value select was mentioned
If you like Value Select, may I recommend Jazz Emu, similar stuff with a hight budget (they did a collab as well). Also, one of the best small channels on the platform right now is NoBitrate, he does NOT upload often, but all of his videos are pure gold.
Wizards with guns(great)
It's obscene how good Bobby Fingers is relative to his number of subscribers, but he's clearly starting to take off.
Alphaphoenix science content is actually insane.
Magic the Noah. Just the funniest shit ever
tony the goat
Almost friday tv was such a lucky find for me. Skycorp was also a good pick.
https://www.youtube.com/@BridgeStuart
https://www.youtube.com/@BridgeStuart
https://www.youtube.com/@BridgeStuart
https://www.youtube.com/@BridgeStuart
glad you found reloxard's channel he's an absolute gem of a creator
Everyone deserves to find out who Bobby Fingers is. Please look him up, you won't regret it.
Ryan George is so good he should be on the tier list
10:07 would a 10sec clip from one of my older videos be allowed? or does it have to be a brand new video?
Bobby Fingers is so increadible. I am so glad you've got him in here! <3
Captain D was way below a few years ago. Following him for a decade or more. I'm happy to see him getting popular.  Same for coffeezilla. Was with him when he had less than 2k subscribers.  Excellent video.
Thor’s shorts in PirateSoftware
My boy Value Select!!!!
PPPeter is such a good travel youtuber, very underrated too!
verytallbart.
i should be on this
very tall bart and aliantos have YTPs that eclipse the OG YTPs, they're just that good.
hey why aren’t i here :[
was really hoping for @hivemind
I found out about captain disillusion through mark rober and he's really good sad he's not uploading that often. He needs more subs as much as the rest of the youtubers on this list
Not related to the current video, but I just wanted to remind everybody that jack promised to release his nudes at 5 million subscribers. He's almost there, everybody! LET'S MATCH THAT MILESTONE!
Reckless Ben has to be up there. Incredible journalism and infiltrations into cults corruption, and its all 100% real. Please check him out if you havent yet
Bobby Fingers is fucking gold.
One of my favorite phrase. “Let’s Learn”
you've got to add the YouTuber dragoon
Glad you got Man Carrying Thing on here
Clearly you missed my channel
IS THAT FUCKING RANTON HELL YEA BROTHER RANTON MENTION AHHHHHH 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
I am coming back to find these people make this a bigger series
Tony Zaret mentioned!! Love his videos so much.
So many great creators on here. Wizards with Guns are worth the watch! Some of the most genuine people
you should definitely check out and add Dark Tark to this. His lowkey comedy is brilliant and his production value is insanely high for having so little subscribers.
AlmostFridayTV is actually super good, I seen their tiktoks and was kinda eh and almost didn't click on one of their youtube videos... So glad I did.
TNR videos is an extremely underrated creator that only has around 400 subs sadly he has made a video in over a year
Another great YouTuber is Paper Will, he does deep dives into obscure topics. He's been researching his current video on North Korea media for over a year now with no sign of an end.
it lacks a little bit of junferno
The amount of ppl im subscribed to on this list was making this less of an informative video for me, and moreso a try-not-to-get-emotional challenge everytime someone I loved got the recognition they deserved. Im so excited for the boost all these creators are going to get from this. Thankyou for doing videos like this.  ALSO SHOUT OUT TONY - HANDS DOWN FUNNIEST MAN ALIVE
This list needs Technology Connections!
With YT's terrible cookie-cutter recommendations, I salute you for expanding my subscriptions that I otherwise wouldn't have discovered on my own
Camwing definitely deserves attention
Dime store adventures is top tier
I am so blessed that the algorithm served me Bobby Fingers on a silver platter on the very day he released his first video. However you wanna describe him, you'll do him injustice, he's Unique with a capital U.
Oh my god I love wizards with guns so much. Been following them since about 50k. Definitely my favorite sketch channel
Just a heads up. Ekat has repeatedly taken effects or routines that are being sold by magicians and exposing the methods behind them online for views. Many creators have reached out to her asking for such videos to be removed and she blocks them. This not only hurts the creators of these effects monetarily, but their magic is broadcast to hundreds of thousands of people and makes the utility of these effects for working magicians less likely to be astonishing.
Outdoor Boys
"Put it in the bin" *goes to the past*
@AlmostFridayTV is soo funny and needs way more subs. and there podcast is so funny and different, its a breath of fresh air
I’d pay top dollar for this kind of curation
@ThisOldTony, @frankmakes @primitivetechnology9550 with CC's! @BobbyDukeArts, not underground but the early @InternetHistorian are great recently I promise @VeronicaExplains to use her as a perfect example of perfect youtube production. I have thousand. like those.
I clicked for Captain Disillusion in the thumbnail, but it's amazing how many I know and don't know.   Jazz Emu is another amazing artist that has collaborated with Value Select
Shouldn't SssssssssniperSnot be at the top of this list?
Value Select is way underrated
Where am I on the list?
I missed my opportunity to do any sort of YouTube videos. I just play games on Twitch for free lol. Well, I got hurt while in service so I don't need to make money while streaming. I'm comfortable. I won't go hungry, that's basically it lol. So I just stream to stream.
Thanks Jack films for using your platform to promote channels that make good content
I wish I had videos worth asking you to feature but I only build model kits that nobody watched. Maybe Ill do some more videos in the future.  Anyway if you dont mind me adding my own recommendations for "good youtubers" for a part 2 that is sure to happen.  Anton Petrov - He covers science related topics mainly focusing on space but sometimes biology topics as well.  Cool Classics - He covers The lives of classic TV actors like Adam West, Nichelle Nichols and Ted Cassidy  Quinn's Ideas - If youre into Scifi this guy is the quintessential youtuber to follow for discussions about books like Dune and The Three Body Problem.  RobWords - Like his name implys he is Rob and he talks about words and linguistics.  Seejanedrill - Leah is a home improvement expert. I have learned things from her videos that 40+ year old veterans in home improvement have never heard of.  UsefulCharts - Its basically the history of things like the family trees of monarchs but in well thought out chart form, he even sells the charts he shows in his videos.  In Praise of Shadows - His 2 part video essay about the Golden Age of Horror Comics is enough to warrant his channel to be on a best of list but all of his video essays are well thought out and presented in a captivating way where you want more after watching a 40 minute video.
I remember discovering Captain Disillusion when I was a teenager in around 08. For Myself getting heavily into video effects it was the best thing since Ryan vs Dorkman for ‘at home VFX’   So happy he is still around and killing it in the exact same style he started with. A true living legend.
I prefer Max0r over Ranton tbh. His editing style stimulates both the ADD and the "I want to rewatch to fully understand this" parts of my brain. Ranton doesn't really do that for me
9/10.  -1 point for no nokeric Dude is making some of the most interesting, disturbing and darkly comic shorts on YouTube. They are inventive and anxiety-inducing, and make me think of the early days of YouTube when it was the Wild West, and there was no concern with polished videos made to game an algorithm.
Honestly I don't have much time to watch YouTube, mainly only when I eat and I only watch jack, and like 2 others so this is good when I need something to watch. Will def be coming back here
YES WIZARDS LESS GOOOOOO
why am I not on this actually, my channel is a fucking mess
If they’re not already on this video, then I nominate Foil, Arms, & Hog for consideration for the next of these
Captain Disillusion's videos have been consistent in quality
So you basically promote your own subscription on youtube. Boring as hell. Absolutely arbitrary and subjective list, nothing 'good' or 'bad' in it.
you should add vlog creations
Jack, have you not watched Lemmino?
Nerd City?
I love Captain Disillusioned
value select mentioned!!!
it's a shame they're 99.9% white men.... I really hope other groups of creators get a chance to shine, too!
Seeing tony zaret made me happy
Absolutely did not expect Ranton to be here. Approved.
I can’t even remember the dude on the lefts name cause he takes 9 months to upload and will upload a 8 min video, same with Michael Reaves. And Reaves will be like “haha I forgot to record this part” like that could of been 10 more mins to the video
Where's SSSniperwolf?
trash
Jacks taking it to the next level! Keep going bald king
You forgot TheFlashHawk, SMH
W Man Carrying Thing mention
james lee should be on here for his amazing style
Wheres all the YouTubers I watch on a regular basis?
No way @trickle_bickle defeated me with 3 more subs again 😆
Should just do regular episodes of this.
I accidentally pressed 0 on my keyboard close to the end of the "intro" time-stamp and it and it restarted back to when Jack said "This is th egood youtuber iceberg." making it seem like those shorts that loop back at the end.  ("wich makes his videos so entertaining to watch" ... "This is the good youtuber iceberg." 👌
where is my dad @wendigoon
He really gave TonyZaret a shoutout omg !
Penn is omnipotent it seems
Not putting Wendigoon on the iceberg is such a missed opportunity.
you forgot drive45
Bro add al jokes in the next one
Ranton is... a lot... but I love the guy for exactly that.
6 good ones
Value Select moment
I’m so FRICKEN happy and honored to be part of this list, it means a lot.   Is what i would say if i was on this list.
Gotta vouch for Almost Friday, those dudes make me cry laughing on the regular
Noooo Jack. Don't shout out the good content, you're supposed to upload it yourself
I cant watch the captain without becoming obsessed with the makeup, how long to put on?how long to take off?if you accidently scratch your chin do you have to start over?
for me it would be Posy he makes excellent video essays about weird physics phenomenoms with amazing editing and stunning shots of things he's talking about
Discovered Almost Friday TV a few months back, and I gotta say - it's some of the best comedy and production I've ever seen.
This seems fun
Weird how many YouTube short YouTubers are featured here
Where DJ peach cobbler
where am I?
So glad to see Bobby Fingers on this list. The most exciting new youtuber in a long long time.
There should be more of this! finding good content is unacceptably difficult, given how abundant it is. This goes way beyond simple nods, it's curation! I love it.
This is just a list of youtubers jack is subscribed to
with 418k subs, Average Rob belongs on the ice berg
Great content as always.
Next one on your list should be " alasdair beckett king "
nah @BobbyBroccoli will always be the most underated youtube creator.
Glad to see Wizards With Guns mentioned. They are SO underrated!
God, wizards with guns is so criminally underrated right now. They should have 3m subs by now, hilarious content.
Jack is like a medic character in the youtube community
Why no Scott the Woz on the top of iceberg though
I’ll be severely disappointed and hurt if I don’t appear at the depths of this iceberg.
FUNKe really should be on here!!!!!!!!!!
already made the Video 10 Seconds Is A Really Short time 😂😂
Well, the 18 or older part for the 10 second clip is holding me back. Too bad
Where is Julian Smith?
does the 10 second video have to be new or can you submit an old vid that still fits the criteria? Couldn't really find that anywhere
3:10 AHHAHAHHAHAHAHA
love seeing wizards with guns here. One of my favorite channels of all time. channels
All the top youtube channels are only populated by mildly-retarted children brainwashed by tictok and social media.   Plus bots.
Stevie Emerson
johnsfilm is my favourite content gatekeeper
The fact that I was presented Bobby Fingers after only one or two videos from him shows how good the Youtube algorithms are, loved it straight away, even sent it to some friends. Nice to see him getting pushed here, the guy is mental, talented and extremely funny.
Great video! :D
Submission done: fingers crossed! 🤞
Oh, SickAnimation. Good ol Newgrounds-Days. Hoohrah....
Out of these channels I only knew There I ruined it and Man Carrying Thing, so it was really interesting to learn about all these YouTubers :)
There's another Youtuber who also deserves recognition - Sethorven. From his Let's plays and his fun multiversal shenanigans videos and his essays on games like dark souls and subnautica.
I’m too random but appreciate all these recommendations
SkyCorp Home Video is one of those channels so ridiculous and satirical that it can make you feel uncomfortable with how accurate it can be. I love it.
chrisandjack chrisandjack chrisandjack. I don't know why they don't have millions of subs.
Why isn't Sssniperwolf there? So good am I right?
no jreg???
Well, that is a pack of good content makers who know the power of montage.
never seen a more trashy iceberg video
thank you jacksfilms
He has ranton on there good.
Immidiately see WWG nice
@qxir should be here
It's crazy how different people like a vast array of different things. Like to me personally, I don't like anything you listed except CD or Bobby's fingers. It seems pretty cool. But all of the "comedy" stuff and zoomerish crazy fast editing stuff you listed, I just can't stand. The fact you didn't even put nexpo or something like him in the top is just wild to me. But again, that's what's cool is that everyone likes different things. There is truly something for everyone.
Where tf is Mayank maximum ( i need editing crash course)
Where is Penguinz0?  Moistcritikal aka Charles White? He's one of the nicest + really good YouTuber of all time. Disappointing list, Jack.The ones you showed us are just a  bunch of nobody's😂 like you...
how dare you credit another channels !
I am infertile from eating scented candles. I rate candle flavor channel
so glad you mentions bobby fingers! purest form of art from a truly great artist!
Ranton is so underrated. he is the way in your very own epilepsy.
I'm already subed to many of these. Bobby Fingers, Man Carrying Thing, AFTV, WWG, and others. But Dime Store Adventures in particular I wanna shout out. Love that channel and the fascinating stories he finds. Excited to check out the few hear I hadn't heard of before though! Thanks Jack.
Al jokes shall never be forgotten
I live for scumbag dad
Theslappablejerk is also a great comedy channel
You should check out crackermilk, great comedy 😂
lets go ranton!
Would be nice if there were more female creators too?
DaThings is another amazingly talented youtube pooper! Her videos are highly re-watchable as the humor is often subtle and well layered. 10/10 youtube channel
Watch Jack bring back Vine shorts with this challenge
I'm looking forward to the Bad Youtubers Iceberg
I love that I can hear your smiling in your voice when talking about how passionate you feel about these creators
Captain for the win!!
Tony Zaret is the goat
Almost Friday tv is definitely underrated, would recommend
I really like George Clarkey, Arthur TV & crew's videos! They're mostly reaction vids, but they are funny guys and the editing is top notch! Also, George Clarkey started the YouTube Court series which is hilarious!
RANTON BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Congratulations SkyCorp I have watched all their videos multiple rounds Even put a review on their IMDb
Lol Lumpytouch
Ssssssssss wolf where?
Jack why aren't you on this list?
I subscribed to so many of these I'm not watching all of them 💀
Shout out value select best channel on YouTube 🤘 jack this is amazing, I am so excited to check out tall the channels on this list I don't already love. We need more of this creators showing love and exposure to other creators
I saw the morshu bible video. It was amazing.
Jacksfilms will be on that iceberg once he makes the Mukbang parody video
I'm sorry, but Man Carrying Things should not be on this list, he's more of a copout or a low effort clown 💀
this should be a yearly series!
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO ALSO KNOWS MAN CARRYING THING!
I am glad Internet Historian isn't in this.
You commenting on my channel won't stop me from just deleting the comment.
I’m so thrilled to know jack also loves wizards with guns. Criminially underrated.
I love u Jack 😘
saw this and thought it was a wendigoon video lol
Wait.. ranton is in there? Never expected that lol
Some random YouTubers I like:  AstralSpiff - 742k subscribers This guy makes some well-edited gaming content. He likes to make special challenges for himself in video games or he will use glitches in video games. The challenges are always interesting to watch but the glitches are actually quite interesting. I've learned a lot about breaking video games from that.   Tom Grossi - 557k subscribers More American Football content. Tom Grossi mostly makes reaction videos to NFL games making fun of what happened in those games. If you actively like to watch NFL games and want to watch some funny content, he's a great choice. Also, he raised $500k for the charity St. Jude while going to all 30 NFL stadiums back during the summer.  Touchdown Rewind - 7.16k subscribers If you like American Football stats, then you'll like this channel. Their videos are usually short but have tons of facts about NFL players. It's a great channel if you want to learn more about American Football.   Geography King - 226k subscribers If you ever wanted to know anything about the geography of the US (and the rest of the world sometimes), this is the channel to go to. Geography King has taken road trips all across the United States (except Hawaii and Alaska). He knows a lot about each state and its unique culture compared to other states.  Sean Fay-Wolfe | Diamond Axe Studios Music - 15.5k subscribers Sean Fay-Wolfe does pop music ranking lists. But if that sounds boring, he has a bunch of twists to the format of top 10 lists. He blends humor and a surprise factor to his tier lists.
so happy to see Wizards With Guns on this list, in fact, I feel validated seeing a good few people I watch on here
OMG WOW! Thanks for adding me Jack! You are truely what Youtube needs right now
ive been watching tony zaret for over a year. content is still terrible, love it.
Where is SSsniperwolff? tsk tsk, discluding her because she's female "yo"
Havent watched yet but really happy to see Wizards With Guns on here!
the concept of content solely based off of highlighting the best qualities of channels of all size is such a nice thing to see online. Amazing video as always
No northernlion, based
Gutted that Steve1989MREinfo didn’t get a mention. His content hasn’t switched up since his inception, but he’s the most down to earth and eloquent guy when it comes to when reviewing Military rations. His charm exudes through the screen! He credits other MRE channels too, in his descriptions! When you sign up to his patreon, he gives you a personal thank you note, a P38 can opener and some old cubes of sugar. He’s a great human being and a great content creator !
You need to make this into a series
i love bobby fingers and tony zaret i remember getting onto bobby on his first video, and i couldnt believe he hadnt uploaded anything else with how high quality it was
Cracker Milk is an amazingly underrated channel
love to see value select recognized, have been watching them for years
You should go back to making videos about SSSniperwolf. I don't think any of your other content gets as much traction.
Another good one is starvharv
Thank you for these recommendations. Cant wait to check these all guys out
shouting out small youtubers is all fun and good until one of them turns out to be a closet neo-naz! We live in a world...
The only one I recognized was “There I ruined it” but the others seem rather promising
Its so cool to see how many more subscribers these channels have after your video!
eli handle b wav was missing...
I would have loved to see "The Right Opinion" on that list. I absolutely love his longform retellings of online... transgressions. Also, Wendigoon, T B Skyen and Schnee. They're the only YouTubers I give money to ever. (Edit: I do realise that this is his opinion, but he makes it sound absolute, so I do too)
if you're popular you're popular, if not you're not. That's just the way it is. You got youtubers like Jacksfilms who can post every day and People like me who are fine being 1 subject rarely posting.
Aaron Paulsen definitely deserves a spot on this list
@bombsquadproductions you guys should do the challenge
I love you❣
You Tube is so vast, I don't know you or any of the million subscribers.  I was subscribed to I ruined it, knew of lil kirbs and think Wizards with Guns is what got me the rec for this video.    Even if you have 10 million subs like LTT or Cyanide & Happiness many youtube users  still have not of heard of them.  I remember when both those channels were closer to a million.  Hell I learned of MR beast when the controversy came up from curing the blind.
where my boy jaystation :( :(
I just came to the comments to give Grimbeard a shout for those that love long-form game content
Value select is really good as well as Jazz Emu
Wow, I genuinely thought this was a Captain Disillusion video because of the thumbnail.
VALUE SELECT BABYYY, FIGHT THE ALGORITHM
wow
Sad that Josh Strife Hayes is not on this list, guy has the wittiest coments on the MMOs he reviews
Man Carrying Thing also makes really intelligent and articulate book reviews if you're into that kind of stuff!
Omg how is philosophy tube not on here, some of the best produced educational YouTube ever
Bobby Fingers is an absolute gem. 100% Agree he will be at 1mil soon. You described his content perfectly. You simply cannot fathom what happens in his brain.
Oh man, I’m so glad to see a shoutout for @valueselecttv. I absolutely LOVE their skits and videos
Are you done with sssniperwolf? Did you get all the clout you needed. I wonder when this video will reach a million view, it seems the one about sssniperwolf did with no problem.
This video style reminds me of vsauces "things you can do online now guys" videos its very good
This channel helps restore my faith in humanity, fr though.
Dude, I love this new era of jacksfilms. Uplifting creators who need a little boost to get well deserved attention from users, calling out those who just steal content from others, its good to see. Jack has always done good work in my opinion, but now he's helping us find more people who deserve more attention.
PETER I SWEAR TO GOD
Hey Jack! Recently Hbomberguy ahowed that Internet Historian's Man In Cave video was plagiarised. Since you hate reaction videos so much, it'd be great to see you draw attention to this, especially since that video made it on that year's Top 10 list.  I think we'd all like to see the issue acknowledged and dealt with rather than hidden, and your help in doing that would be invaluable.
Cs188
what about rm brown
Credit where it's due to all other creators featured in this amazing video but Bobby Fingers is on a whole other level of existence: I was intrigued by Jack's description of the MJ video so I binged the playlist in the description and all the videos are great but once I got to Bobby Fingers' video I had to stop and contemplate what i just watched, an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't deserve to be on youtube, heck it doesn't even deserve to be a full fledged movie, it's more of a lucid dream or a revelation from a higher power. I am absolutly appalled after watching the video, have subscribed and will watch his other videos. Thank you for the recomendation, keep up the great work Jack.
This video is... mmmmm chefs kiss! So many awesome channels to check out!
Hey you forgot "al jokes" one of the best channels out there
This be a lot of men. Do you watch any women Jack?
@TripleSGames belongs on this iceberg. They explains the rules of different board games and their variants clearly and concisely. Their videos lack humor (apart from some videos), but it's so entertaining to just watch, even if you don't plan on actually playing the board games that they explain.
Just stopped in to say I've watched you off and on for 17 years myself. You are a YouTube hero.
Love it, Love em. KEEP PUSHING GUYS
4.09 hey! i already know this one! cool!
You should have been in the list yourself
Why is NerdCity not on this list? some of the highest quality content on the platform and does a lot for other creators, super under-rated. He deserves more credit than he gets!
Jack good video but you forgot the channel meditations for the anxious mind!  https://www.youtube.com/@meditationsfortheanxiousmind
TONY ZARET MENTIONED
wish I Did A Thing could've gotten a mention from all the insane inventions he creats
This Iceberg will never be valid without WatchMojo, UNSUBSCRIBED!!!!!
No FUNKe??? Whaaaaat???
You forgot Optimum Tech. Tech reviews with Nolan tier cinematography
Wizard with Guns is just amazing to me. They make consistently _great_ comedy, with very decent production value, and they are struggling to reach 300k subs, after 5 years and 250 videos. Just impressive how unfair is the algorithm sometimes.
It is wild how funny Skycorp Home Video is. Some of the most laugh-out-loud stuff I've seen on YT in years.
I hope Hbomberguy doesn't make a video on any of these youtubers
You HAVE to put en-ex, an amazing finance YouTuber with 100 subs
So glad you mentioned Wizards with Guns. My favorite channel, I’ve been subscribed for years. They are very underrated and I hope they get more recognition in the future.
Aw, RSK is over 10k now 😊
took me 7 years to finally reach just 100 subs. Keep fighting everyone!
I got so excited when I heard him mention Value Select!
Obviously this is all very objective and definitly not at all a subjective opinion after which the iceberg was formed. But I appreciate your efforts!
I would have put Jaden Williams on that list bc he has some of the most interesting yt shorts and amazing editing and writing, and his beamng series are hilarious aswell
I really hope that wizards with guns get more love. Those guys are amazing and deserve way more notoriety
Now do it again but with more two token women! :)
Dude is probably dealing with that doxxing bullshit, all the while uploading videos like this.   You are beyond a good dude!
The fact that Wizards With Guns and Almost Friday TV has less than 500k subs should be a crime.
Bae fakemon
im on the top of bad youtubers iceberg 😎
I LOOOVVEEE lil kirbs!!
Legendary YouTuber who copied kurtgesacks video style
so glood tony zarent is getting some attention lol i love how many layers of irony he can put into everything
RANTONI!!!!   nice one
why no more sssniperwolf?
a lot of these seem too much like tiktok slop for me
Jack 4:36 I’ve been using delete me before they ever approached me also Jack 5:05 I’d still be doing it myself
🖤✌️👁️
I'm not on the list buddy
how the f do I know all those channels?
UR HAIRS LOOKING THICKER N FULLER TODAY !
Man Carrying Thing is probably ny favorite youtuber rn so its cool to see him on here
OMG TONY ZARET MENTIONED
What a surprise, all white and almost only men. Such an echo chamber
long time-ish wizards with guns youtube channel, can say they are a great youtube channel
Thanks to Captain Disillusion I discovered *Ami Yamato* .A very underrated animator. She was the first to do animated character vlogs with great VFX. Some say she is the original Vtuber, but don't let that put you off. She is an animator, not mocap and her videos are well written and hilarious.
James Lee is the king of animation. BrandonFM, Joseppi, Big Boss, and Lemmino are the kings of documentary (and fashion). RackaRacka is the king of filmmaking. GxAce is the king of camera reviews and photography. Optimum Tech is the king of computer hardware reviews. Flyingkitty is the king of YTPs. _Bosivert is the god of ARGs. div_y is the king of Minecraft humor. Filmento is the king of movie reviews. In59seconds is king of psychology. Dyinglama is king of 100 percent legal city exploration. Arean is the king of videogame storytelling. Maxor is king of crack editing. DIY perks is king of DIY tech. Omozoc is king of stop-motion. Tabbes is queen of storytimes. Manley Reviews is king of videogame reviews. Justmehabibi is king of meme editing. Degenerocity is king of commentary. Omri is king of metahumor and music videos.   There is so much quality content on the platform, you just have to sift through a lot. There are many channels particularly in the animation sphere like Krugston, Ethereal Snake, David Firth, IanHubert, Funke, and maps and plans, Podel, hyper, Hoot, PixelswithaZ, Leon Massey, Cel Shock, and Ahoy, that are constantly slept on, some way more than others. I’d love to see an in-depth video covering as much  good channels across all genres as possible.
Why does jack remind me of Hugo Weaving?
I like how if you click on any of the youtubers at the floor they have like 1k subs now
Youre missing Sir Swag, I Did A Thing, Exurb1a, Pursuit of Wonder and alotttt more, vid needs to be longer
I can't believe Mauler isn't on this list!!! Great vid jacksfilms
no captainsauce
Been subbed to dime store adventures for a while now
The playlist is a good idea
Add Big Tugg to the next list! One of my favorite up & coming youtubers!  https://youtube.com/@biggtugg?si=r06JmNS8FeggkF-F
As someone who is not on the list, I can confirm I am not a good youtuber.
I would also suggest Ahoy! , who makes lots of video game history videos, and has been doing so for years
3:15 “MRBEEEAA-“
I found Wizards with Guns a few weeks ago and was sad they had so few subs. They are definitely deserving of the spotlight
Careful, Pewdiepie did this one time and some of them ended up being nazis I think.  In all seriousness, thank you for the new content suggestions!
Does Mr Beast or Penguinz0 count
Dear jacksfilms,  If hbomberguy's newest video doesn't make it to #1 this year, you're a crazy person.  No, but seriously, you've had a hell of a year, my dude. I hope the rest of it goes well and next year sees certain beautiful individuals actually held to the standard proposed by their corporate overlords, and less stupid shit happens. Can't wait to finish this video and find more channels to enjoy.
HEY! theres a cool channel i came across on yt called "thats a bad idea" and they create short form comedy sketches and some horror shorts, (and they are really funny)
If you do a part 2 you gotta include dankpods he absolutely deserves a spot
CAPTAIN DDDDDDD
Thanks for the shoutout!
CHAZE is also a very good youtuber
Im at the bottom of the bottom of this tier list. 😎
Value select has a song about a magician who worked as a spy for the CIA, When I'm feeling unmotivated I just go and listen to it
Miniminuteman
I hope you do more of these 😭 And I hope you out Bridge Stuart in the list next. He's been making rly entertaining skits and I hope more people notice him
you forgot dunkey
Well there's the issue. Erik has ingested faaaaarrrr too much soy. He used to be a great YouTuber a very long time ago, back when he was still high on salvia. But today, ehhhh hes way too concerned with the soy. And it makes me worried about him.
I hope one day i can end up on this iceberg.
Me waiting for Random channel Keith to appear: O•O
CD IS ON THE THUMBNAIL LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOO YOU HAVE WIZARDS WITH GUNS IN THERE! god, i love those guys' work so much.
Sausage fest
Waiting to see Jimmy Is Promo on this Iceberg
im amazed you didnt take a jab at erik lmao with your history i was expecting something more like the end of the smosh roast
And ranton is also a kung fu Shaolin warrior
Imaging getting a shoutout from Jack. What a honor. Jack has always been such an awesome guy and this video really shows that he sees all of us.
So glad to see There I Ruined It, Man Carrying Thing, Skycorp Home Video, and Value Select here! I’m the only one I know who watches TIRI and SHV :’(
I’ve gotta say that Jazz Emu fits perfectly on this list. He creates stupidly funny, groovy music that is completely underrated. I’d call him a long form Value Select.
ufvidhvd thats so cool i needed recs, much love jack
For education: Freya Holmer has amazing videos about animation, math, and programming
Foekoe and Desbug are also really good (though desbug has less variety)
LOL 2:53 2:53
Whwres mr beast 2:40
Sienful shouldve made the list. Extremely well edited short "video essays" i don't like using that term because it doesn't have a good rep but check him out please.
Getting awful close to the promised nude leak Jack... 5 Mill is super close
Wizards with Guns is my favorite sketch YouTube channel.
I have 293 Subs only But I’m in the Bad YouTubers Iceberg
Holy shit Sick Animation has been having me say "Get 'em wet, Shaggy" for a decade
I really appreciate you doing this jack, I've loved youtube all my life, and I know there is lots of great content that is overshadowed by the amount of garbage there is. You truly understand the essense of the site.
Very underrated one I've found recently is DanIsBlue. The only thing the algorithm randomly gave that I actually enjoy
8:48 incredible engagement rate for  a 3 day video is kinda wild
"But I never laugh" *WHAT ARE YOU DOING*
Jack you're a real one. Doing great work here!
Wait, this kept popping in my recommended and i kept ignoring it but it was from Jackfilms? I thought it was just some random channel. Maybe you should put your face in the thumbnail or something.
THANK YOU FOR SHOUTING OUT ALMOST FRIDAY!!! those guys are absolute geniuses.
You ok? About the sssniperwolf situation?
known abt man carrying thing thing since fall 2021 when he did book content
RANTONI
Ranton mentioned?!?!?! Common JohnMovie W
VALUE SELECT HELL YEAHHHH
jack why didn’t you include me in the iceberg
The tital or at least premise should be some of the good youtubers iceberg because YouTubes a big place
What about MrBeast?
Disappointed to not see Ordinary Sausage on this list
SivlaGunner for a part 2?
Al jokes Jaden Williams
No jon bois?
This is the PERFECT antidote to meaningless reaction videos. Well done, man, well done indeed
filthy frank was the best
they are all bad
Dr.Skipper is so cringe. Oeboshoes is the best
My deepest was wizards with guns. Good picks!
Aw hell ya got to love someone showing Marc M some damn respect heyo
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
EmpLemon Leo Vader Funke b-mask Shammy
AlmostFriday is GOATED content. so happy jack is shouting them out and theyre getting the publicity they deserve
So happy to see Man Carrying Thing here
The harry gold show is a very cool youtuber i think https://www.youtube.com/@TheHarryGoldShow  he does drawing stuff and umm yea
WHERE'S VSAUCE???
after this video I might come back to youtube
Tony Zaret is criminally underviewed and underappreciated. Glad to see him on here, despite the woke liberals trying to hold him back.  Shoutout Value Select also!
Great video, but what about DankPods lmao!? Sure, he has 1.5 million subs but he's one of the best tech YouTubers out there. Maybe his Australian accent and persona might turn people off but he (like many other YouTubers on this iceberg) has a very unique video format that never gets old. One of the most hard working creators on the platform imo.
I also think a YouTuber named Caddicarus Is pretty funny
I respect Jack too much to not subscribe to every single channel.
I dont know why Ranton being here made me feel so vindicated. I love that guy so much, and its hard to recommend him sometimes because his vids are so sporadic. Thanks Jack
why does this guy look like my actual math teacher. not like *a* math teacher, but the dude that teaches my math class looks exactly like jacksfilms
LIL KIRBS!!!!!!!
Uhhh you forgot to include Posy
Much respect for this kinda spot light video, hope it becomes a trend that lasts
I love Man Carrying Thing, he never misses, the absolute legend!
iceberg irrelevant, gawx and matt colbo not included
What's sad is that Jack himself is STILL (after EVERYTHING with SSStalkerwolf...) just below 5mil subs himself. You are so underappreciated, Jack. Over a decade later, you're still my favorite YouTuber.
Red Letter Media where? Internet Historian where?
glad to see Man Carrying Thing getting some love, Plankton Farts and Dies (Real) is truly a masterpiece
I was there for the editing of this video! Well done on it, Jack!
Depends what your tastes are..idk any of these guys
seeing skyhome almost felt like whiplash, i stopped thinking about them entirely after they pivoted hardcore into NFTs. dont know if they're still doing them now, though
lol, absolute looser
Love this series. Do MORE!
Bro you forgot the greatest and only, jazz emu.
Tony Zaret’s work is legendary. There were… years? Where he pretended he was pandering his videos to Chinese audiences just like Hollywood does with blockbusters. His work is insane I love it
Id love to see a sequel to this for more hidden gem youtubers like Ashens, Caddicarus and Peter Knetter who could do with way more attention
Yes! SkyCorp Home Video is hilarious! :)
ADD DOXXERWOLF OR SHE MIGHT BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE!!!
Rantoni Pepperoni ❤
working on it Jack..
captain disillusion is so fuckin funny.
Eddache and Project Kino are two channels I enjoy every single video they release. Project kino is extremely underrated with only 15k subs creating fantastic video essays. Eddache kills it every time and a great sense of humor and timing.
dont forget patrick more!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳      i did emojis because he needs to see this
Lil kirbs is a legend, been watching for years
The only one i knew going into this video was lilkirbs because i used to play quite a bit of Mario Maker until Nintendo decided to stop updating it. I still watch lilkirbs and Carl and DGR through
im mad cinnimasicre isnt on here
Wizards With Guns has been one of my top 5 channels, for a little bit now.
huh, nice; please keep on doing this and stop giving the cookie monster any further attentions.
SkyCorp FTW woooo!! Im 90s child, and love there videos   Peleas fracture me in the you're grammar suck
TONY ZARET IS MY GLORIOUS KING
_Don't forget the submarine man topic..._
Another populat r but not household name popular good ytber would def. be danny gonzalez!!! he has like 5 millionish subs? Or maybe more I dont pay too much attention, but he's funny and acrually adds value to his reactions.
I know you couldn't include every channel that deserves more recognition in a short video, but no James Lee  ? I'm surprised, I'm still flabbergasted he has less than a million subs with the amount of work and the incredible style of  all of his videos.
kingboo97 boutta have a word hearing that Lilkirb is best smm2/j
n o t h a n k y o u  i don't wanna be roasted
You're a real gem John Jack! <3
Ranton is just too much, his style is basically a nonstop noise that makes it very hard to watch even one of his videos.
Eh
I’ve made a lot of channels on about different things over 5 years though I never got many subscribers. I’ve fallen in just about the deepest in the algorithm cracks as possible.
Damn, was somehow hoping to see @unclesamsonite here
Jack I know you probably won’t see this but this guy makes the greatest comic content ever— even if you don’t like comics his videos are incredibly well researched and fascinating   https://youtu.be/uH91zSklnb8?si=9eOoPXAS3OZ5--sb
You forgot vsauce
Thank you for using your platform to bring attention to these great creators!! I learned a lot and i appreciate you!!
Unsub from XQC
Where’s LLLniperwolf?
I did a Thing is also amazing, also love the Internet Comment Etiquette & Skycorp, some of the absolute best
Where id Jreg?
Cyzstix should be on this list just by the way he is able to combine the analog horror and comedy genres so good
dr skipper is mid as fuck bro ima be real
'And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.   (Job 37:21-22) 'And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.   (Matthew 16:16,18) 'This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.   (John 3:19) 'Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

(Romans 15:13) 'By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.   (Hebrews 11:24-26) 'Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.   (Philippians 4:20)
Thank you for including me in this list, John!
spreading positivity and wholesomeness, i love it jack, keep it up, this is great, ney, amazing content.
I can't believe I recognize Tony Zaret!! I've seen his stuff on Instagram
tony zaret mentioned !!! glad to see him get more recognition
Michael eat a bug 🐛
I haven't started yet, but seeing Value Select on the Iceberg just already affirms the validity of this lists content creators being top quality
I actually follow some of these folks already!
Yoo wizard with gun
I haven't watched a single video of Dime Store Adventures yet but this is exactly the kind of videos I like to watch I will be sucked down this rabbit-hole to never be seen again thank you for the recommendation
You're a good man
Holy shit Bobby Fingers is amazing.
A little surprised and disappointed @joel-haver is not included in this. not sure if it's just an opinion thing, oversight, or something else, but he consistently produces laugh out loud awkward comedy sketches.
Oh hey Jack, I've been watching you for over a decade. I hadn't checked this channel in over two weeks, and this was completely unexpected, and I'm so grateful for the shoutout. Uhh more coming soon ig lmao wow I'm blown away
Love Tony Zaret, glad to see the shoutout!
moon, vile eye, hyro
I was offered to be in this video but i declined because it will take 3 more years til i make 10seconds of content
fulnkncb
So close to the 5 mil jacksfilsm onlyfans; I can almost TASTE it....   And it tastes GOOD.   Also anyone else kinda irrationally annoyed that Sssniperwolf managed to successfully make Jack her bitch in a way by stopping him from posting about her anymore?  Like, she did something blatantly illegal and lawsuit warranted, and yet got off scott free while Jack, with his tail betwixt his legs, decides to throw up the white flag and instead use the second channel to uplift smaller channels.   Can't he do that on his main channel, where they'd(said smaller channels) get more attention? Idk... Just don't like how easily Sssniperwolf took the W just because she intimidated him.   I hate it when bad people win man. ):
RIP there I ruined it :(
I’m glad ur giving RSK so much attention he really deserves it!
Wizards with Guns, Wizards With Guns, Wizards With Guns
Hello my friend.  I subbed you when I found your channel and you bravely took on the worlds smallest giant SS....I always got mentally stopped when I saw the ss....I wonder if there's a hidden message there?  Anyway.  I watched her vids and found them funny until I found out they were stolen.  I'm not into that.  I'm not a creator and way to old to start.  I do find the talent I see on YouTube and TT great.  This generation of creators have more talent than all of hollywood or the big 3 TV that once ruled the world.  Back then you had a hand full of great directors and writers but you could starve to death trying to sell your stuff.  The talent you and the others make is inspiring.  I wish I was young again.  I doubt I would be a huge success but to have the ability to be creative. Anyway, when I saw your channel and you exposed SS....there's that darn mental block again....for stealing from some very creative people, I checked it out and I was done.  Losing one person is no big to her but it meant something to me.  I don't steal.  I've never stole and I don't like people that do. The crossing the line part where she actually put your family in harm would have pushed me over the edge.  I'd never let my family be at risk and I would take all actions necessary to protect them.  I'm just an old redneck but I have high morals and ethics about family. Thanks for all you did but you and I know YT will let her back on and really has by not removing her from the platform.  YT is gutless and we all know it.  They too will be the my space of this decade.   Thanks again.  I look forward to all your post.  I'm not a creator but I will watch the full content you post.  Well done
unsubed libral video leftest sjaw propganda should hav ben baned
wizards with guns is so good
Can you add Russ Cook's channel Hardest Geezer to the 'berg, he's running the length of africa for charity, he's raised nearly £100k so far and is sitting at only 137k followers. he's producing high quality content all while in the rural african outback, showing how lovely the people who live there are. He's also completely insane
What I love about this is that all of these videos are the content I enjoy watching, but I only knew one of them beforehand. Now I have many more content creators to explore and enjoy! Thank you!
Wizards with guns is amazing
Me waiting for noodle and nelward:
Jack giving almost Friday a shout out who woulda thought
heck yeah, value select for the win!
I love @tonyzaret
Wizards with guns ya
Wow I can't believe Tony Zaret is on here, I've been a fan of his for a long time
I think your message at the end distracted from YouTubers this video was about
10:14  *But I never laugh* - Tim Robinson's I Think You Should Leave, —Netflix's giant sh*tpost.       don't get me wrong; I love it.
Where me?
For the next one it would be nice to see some more female and POC creators. It was feeling very white male dominated in this one. I could for instance recommend ViHeart for clever math videos, JunsKitchen for creative cooking and cats, or Princess Weekes for in depth video essays
Bricks and disorder
When you do the next one of these (and yes, you will) you have to mention FUNKe, his videos have highly stylised animation while he talks about anything from concept albums to video games to Junji Ito while having plenty of humour crammed in. His stuff is excellent do check him out if you get the chance
Personal recommendation: Wambu
Brutal Moose, Umami, the minute hour, native birds. A couple of great channels.
Woooo Ranton mentioned!!!!
WIZARDS WITH GUNS
you are fucking amazing dude. god
cant believe you watch @Ranton!
Thanks for this! It's been hard finding good content I like with the algo and all. This is great, I love Almost Friday binging them now :D
SO glad to see the Wizards mentioned. Been following them for years and they only get better in every way. Give those boys a TV budget and they'll be unstoppable.
Almost Friday TV is a gem. The first day i discovered them I binged all of their videos. Just a group of hilarious dudes making amazing videos.
Man carrying iceberg
Forgot the outdoor boys
Yoooo lil kirbs is great!!
Glad that Rantoni is getting some praise!
i love the big d, he so cool when the video is a cgi he remake the vid it awsomes
A few recommendations if there’s a part 2: Scott the Woz needs no introduction, and he’s my favorite creator on the platform besides maybe Mr. Beast. Jet Lag: The Game is a seasonal competition channel by Sam Wendover that baffles me as to why it’s still doesn’t have 1 million subscribers with it’s very fun ideas, accessibility, and clean editing made with plenty of effort and care. Out of the YTP community my favorites are DaThings, and og that has mastered the art of sentence mixing, Qwistoff, who incorporates animation into his edits, and Kadz, who makes simple yet very funny edits of well known sources. A couple up and coming Nintendo creators (I’m personally quite a Nintendo fan) are Jopes, whose content mostly revolves around experimenting with MarioKart, and Drengodr, who hasn’t made a ton of content to this point, but already has a really good style, tending to cleverly create and craft concrete sentences conforming to the confines of alliteration.
I love Value Select!
Jacksfilms forgot himself on this list, wont lie
Eh ehmmm Vsauce?
10 years from now, we will hear interviews of people now being a youtube millionaire, only because jack gave them a shoutout years before. I cant say how much i appreciate someone using their reach and plattform to connect and reach out finaly, instead of only collaborating with bigger names for one video.
Ones I know Scumbag dad Lumpy touch There I ruined it Lilkirbs Value select Doktor skipper
Common wizards with guns W
Iceberg video that isn’t 2 hours long? Yessir
TONY ZARETT MENTIONED 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🗣️🗣️‼️🗣️‼️‼️🗣️
ngl this video sounds like chatgpt wrote it
shout me out cuh
Came for the creators, stayed for the Tim Robinson reference.
i highly recommend leo vader if anyone is looking for slightly niche but top quality youtube videos. his editing and overall awkward vibes make for great video essays
I have 88 subs now ! 😅
"Rich Man INSULTS Poor Man, INSTANTLY REGRETS IT!" By Tony Zaret is my favourite video on the platform
Tony zaret is great
Tonyzaret my boy
It's crazy to me how underrated Tony Zaret is, I swear I thought he was a way bigger channel
Ayo u got ranton on here? Hek ya. Spicy pepperoni.
Love to see Wizards With Guns here, they've got some of the best skits ever. Watching them blow up from 1k subs or so has been awesome
im so glad value select got featured, the king absolutely deserves it
I cannot believe how inspiring Jacks recent actions have been. I’ll admit, when he first announced the redirection of his content (steering away from vvVoldemort and focusing on new creators) I was very upset. I felt like she “got away with it” and got exactly what she wanted, but I’m very happy to say that Jacks recent uploads have completely changed my perspective on this. Huge respect for turning a terrible situation into something that simply benefits the people you were trying to protect beforehand in a positive way that can inspire other channels to do the same
Man Carrying Thing has less than 1million subs? That is wild
if you make a sequel, make sure to include people from this list!  tom cardy (1.5m) - quite literally the funniest musical comedian ive ever seen. all of his short songs are quick and catchy, and all of his long songs are absolute bangers and sometimes end up being somewhat profound, while also still very funny.   solar sands, (1.3m) - started from making videos about deviantart undertale inflation drawings, now moved onto making insane high quality video essays that will just live you staring at the wall thinking about existence. its been a pleasure to watch him evolve over the years!  louie zong, (1m) i cannot recommend this guy and his music enough. hes a jack of all trades, does 3d/2d animation, produced music, live music, tutorials, animatics, just anything. there doesnt pass a day where i dont him one of his songs.  eddache, (200k) okay now we are getting to the actually underrated ones. many know him as the guy whos friends with tomska and appears in his videos, but he actually has his own channel and its great! its about film and television history among other stuff and gives really good and entertaining reviews about them, while also including silly animations inbetween.   polyblank, (50k) this guy is really new, and has only super recently started making videos about art history. fascinating stuff!  aaron paulson, (800k) his short form content is A+ top notch just perfection. absurdist humor, super stylized, weird musical gimmicks, he plays guitar and drums AT THE SAME TIME????  jazz emu, (400k) his songs are very catchy and his music videos are top notch! amazing comedian and musician.  hope this doesnt get buried under "first" comments
Man Carrying Thing!!
KroboProductions i think would fit in reallly well here. has under 100k subs and "The Fesh Pince of Blair" series is some of the best content on youtube
Funke better be on the next one.
Bounced on my boys iceberg to this.
No fucking way Jacksfilms mentioned Tony Zaret 😭😭😭
I strive to make it on here one day 🫡
Another one id like to throw out there is fleekazoid
Zanny should make an appearance on this list imo
Jacksfilms is becoming the true hero of YouTube. The one we all need, but YouTube as a company absolutely doesn’t deserve. I hope our boy sticks around for as long as YouTube is around. Thank you for everything that you do, Jack.
Captain D really is top tier for sure. Love that guy.
Tony Zaret is the GOAT
Disappointing lack of worthikids but everyone else was more than deserving of their place in this video
YES CAPTAIN DISILLUSION IS ON HERE
What? Where is Bobby broccoli?
Man forgot the jersey boys  1. Anthpo (surface) 2. 1MTS (Shalow Water)
You should have putted Alfaoxtrot in it, he is super underrated
I bet Jack wanted to put Ssseth but can't risk publicising his affiliations to the merchant's guild
I highly suggest Chris and Jack. They are a what old YouTube used to be. Fun clever skits that can be rewatched over and over again.
Ive been watching tony zaret for like 5 years now. Glad to see him get some recognition
Amazing video what a great idea
Let’s get my boy Jacob geller in there
from the clips you've showed, ranton seems like they have a filthyfrank/idubbbz level of chaos while remaining respectful, which i greatly respect.
Ranton and captain D at the top I already agree with this video
I don't see SSSniperwolf on here? I know she's got a lot of flack recently, but lets all be honest for a second. She's GREAT at being sus.
Hey Dr.Skipper! Nice Jack thank you for showing love out there even after you were treated in such a poor way but YouTube     YouTube your garbage and cater to who makes you the most money.
tony zaret is one of those accounts I love and always just assume is huge before realizing they're still pretty niche
WIZARDS WITH GUNS YEAHH!!!!!!
Where scott the woz
I discovered Value Select a few years ago thanks to you, Jack, and I'm so grateful. Happy to see him here as well!!
YES CAPTAIN DISILLUSION GETTING RECOGNITION
Im actually proud of how many of these guys im subscribed to, seeing them recognized is amazing.
I LOVE VALUE SELECT
I'm so happy to see Ranton get mentioned in this video. He's such a criminally underrated gem.
jacksfilms is the man. might even be the guy.
You're doing God's work.
I’m a creator of comments, if that counts.
I love wizards with gun and I don’t know how they aren’t more popular
This is so cool. I've been losing interest in YT as a whole for multiple reasons. From their response to The Incident to the disastrous impact on my mental health/dopamine dysregulation, to the awful ways they treat their (sometimes very young) workers and the ads that are completely out of control at this point, I just think they've become a terrible, predatory corporation that i don't want to encourage anymore. However from a millenial who's been there since 2006 to another, thank you Jack for rising above all of the crap and using your own status to add value to your fellow creators. Humans are worth more than the unregulated companies that crush them.
A iceberg under 30 min? Crazy
As an avid Lil Kirbs fan, I’m so glad to see him on this iceberg
Captain Disillusion is peak SFX
What an awesome idea!
Would also recommend Wendigoon if you’re into long videos about theories and horror, and strange aeons if you’re into internet history !
The only channel I knew of and immediately recognized the profile pic was LilKirbs. Amazing YouTube channel for an amazing gamer. So glad he got some recognition here because his channel is so worth watching for anyone, not just mario enjoyers
I want to shout out some actually good Youtubers below the iceberg:  _Boisvert - short psych. surrealist horror channel. Makes a series with lore. Out of pocket deep artist.  Kathy Loves Physics - educational Youtuber. Deepest dive into the history of particular ideas and discoveries in Physics on the platform.  Dialect - also educational. Focuses on special relativity. Animations and expositions are particularly very clear.  Dankpods - funniest tech reviewer on the whole site.  AvE - working class scholar, I swear. Man makes his trade into poetry.  Moth light Media - Mesozoic visualiser. Educational. Best animations of prehistoric fauna out there  Art of the Problem - Educational. Clearest expositor of computer science I've ever seen.  Worldbuilding Notes - short interesting concepts for worlds informed by anthropology.  Web of Stories - interviews from academic, and some non-academic celebrities, as they tell their whole story. Good for reference.  The Tarnished Archeologist - biggest deep dive channel into Elden Ring lore out there. Draws on real life inspirations to make highly novel inferences on Elden Ring lore.  Neat AI - Educational (sorry if it's alot; I guess it's just my neck of the woods). Explores Cellular Automata.  Earth.parts - Educational. Best geology resource here.  Metal571 - it's been a long time, but this guy used to make THE MOST HELPFUL headphone reviews on this site bar none. Low production value, but it's worth it.  Ben Eater - this guy makes the strangest and most awesome computing videos out there.  So Uncivilised - Video Essays. Star Wars apologia. Extremely well written.  PilotRedSun - batshit animations, bordering on horror.  Ahoy - videogame history channel. Longform, captivating. He does what he does very well.  US Auto Industry - it's crazy this is here, but it's true. Educational. Will give you the clearest explanation as to how the diff. in your car works.  BobbyBroccoli - History channel. Focus on scientific fraud, and how politics and science interact, particularly in America. Awesome visuals to convey data and organise information, plus synthwave.  Tantacrul - highly entertaining and engaging tirades on the follies of UX design in music software.  Brian Douglas - Educational; more technical. He's here because he's responsible for my understanding control theory. Excellent content, but more niche.  Wyvern66 Economics - go here to learn economics, and nowhere else.  Why These Notes - Clearest Music Theory channel. Best explanation of tetrachords.  There's so many more, but these guys I feel have the broadest appeal, while being pretty underrated.
RM Brown deserves a mention
“This means nothing to me. I have no opinion about it, and I don’t care.”  -Pablo Picasso, 1969.
This is fuckin awesome. Appreciate all the promotion and support you've downpoured unto us smalltubers like some benevolent, goatee'd raincloud floating the heavens abov' 🌧🌧🌩  Might I add: Imaperson (acid-speed YTPs from the YTP golden age) VeryTallBart (YTP of right-wing pundits) brahkie (2006 - 2009 styled vlogs, they even have a neocities website) The Minute Hour (hilarious surreal animated skits) u m a m i (vaporwave-y surreal animated shorts & electronic music)
Hey wizards with guns made the cut
shoutout to hot dad, man's only got 165k subs. criminal.
OMGG WIZARD WITH GUNs yessss I LOVE EM SO MUCHHH❤❤❤
Legitimate gold mine
You forgot mine
Thank you for showing love to Marc M. He deserves it.
new favourite jack arc. also can this become a trend? can every youtuber share their top tubers list?
Was so excited to see Almost Friday TV and Wizards with Guns here! They are seriously some of the best sketch groups on the platform, or that I have ever seen.
YAY WIZARDS WITH GUNS!!!!!!!!!
wHY IS JACKSFILMS FIXIN YOUTUBE FOR tHEM! smh
Great video, love Value Select and Wizards with guns, I’ll need to check out the rest.  With so many good youtubers, a more extensive list would be hours long. I would like to shout out a few I love and I think deserve to be up there with the greats. Crackermilk, sketch comedy channel with them being master’s of subversion. Rav, for making probobly the most entertaining League content (and now WoW) with very witty writing. And Douge Douge, who makes the best stream highlights videos.
I can hard vouch for Almost Friday. Some of the most well-made sketches and characters I've seen. They're naturally great at comedy but many of their long-form sketches cross the line into comedy-horror. Their podcast is also great for bite-sized character concept.
I LOVE Man Carrying Thing
I love Man Carrying Thing, especially his world famous “Plankton farts and dies” video!
Man Carrying Thing is one of my current favorite channels. The absolute legend never misses!
Great video Jack. Pick me next time. Lol
Man carrying thing is truly the voice of a generation. He really is carrying thing.
thank you.
Honestly, these recent videos about YouTube creators and your new bingo really feels like a medicine being applied to youtube. Here's hoping that over time, this place will heal
Just by having a vague understanding of Jack's humour I was 100% certain Skycorp would be there
Just by having a vague understanding of Jack's humour I was 100% certain Skycorp would be there
Wizards w Guns the throat goats no cap
OH MY GOD DIME STORE ADVENTURES!!! I LOVE THAT CCHANNEL SO MUCH!! so happy to see him on here!
based ad
we need to add Sweigun with his youtube iceberg series dude
we need to add Raymundo ‼️
Love that I know most of these haha Getting my tastes complimented by jack
Disappointed no tom O'Regan.
Kinda sad not seeing me on here. Still giving you a like tho.
hope to be on these types of lists someday :')
wizards with guns getting a shout out!
I love this so much!!
LMAO DIDNT EXPECT TO SEE THERE I RUINED IT AND LILKIRBS ON HERE NO WAY 😂   Respect Jack for doing this 💪🫶
Where is midnight krick
@man carrying things
7:30, it’s not just penn but also his daughter! (She made a recent appearance on fool us)
one channel that I suggest looking at for ytp's is very tall bart. his vids are very political but they are also very funny.
Erin gpt
Man  Carrying Thing finally getting the recognition he deserves for his work on Plankton Farts and Dies (Real)
Ironically, Jack is gonna sell all your data from the form to data brokers.
what a cool thing to do for the community. I appreciate the work
TONY ZARET!!! I've been a fan of his for years he's so so funny I'm happy to see him here! One thing though, in the future could you try and highlight more women YouTubers? I'm always trying to find more women YouTubers but a lot of recommendations videos are usually men
Should’ve had Vsauce on ther too
Lilkirbs mentioned 💪💪🌊
I’d personally like to recommend BigTugg. He kinda just talks about things like how he thinks space is scary or why he thinks weddings suck, but he does it in such a chaotic way that’s just addicting. Check him out
Where tf is Scott the Woz?
Sick animations are super under rated yet have a big impact on YouTube culture since I see a lot of bigger YouTubers referencing his videos, appreciate jack 4 putting their name out there
yooo i was just looking for a list like this, thanks jack
I've never heard of any of the ones at the tip, but a lot of them underwater
And yet Captain D is still underrated. Best channel on YouTube, no doubt. (Sorry Jack)
Tony zaret is the goat
We salute you
honestly, the VHS style's classic is Jack Stauber, even tho its weird it would take so much time to even imitate one of his videos
VALUESELECT FEATURED?
Can I mention @tomatoanus? I know speedrunning isn't for everyone, but his documentaries are amazing!
Wow Jack appreciates youtube poops. Are you familiar with dathings1?
Im surprised al jokes wasnt on here hes funny
I’ve heard of three of these channels, lol.
TONY ZARET MENTIONED
YES!! I love Man Carrying Thing. I do want to add--for those who don't know his channel--MCT also occasionally uploads incredibly well-thought-out book reviews. He's amazing
Rsk now has literally over 12K subs that's WILD
I LOVE how topical the sponsor is! Very well done.
Im so happy to see a video like this. I hope everyone steals your idea and shows off the cool underrated youtubers theyve been watching
I hate that you had to change what you do because of sssniper, but i love what this has turned into. I hope this starts a new trend in youtube where bigger channels help and support smaller creators. It shows that there is a great community here on youtube. And that we shouldn't let the scums of the platform take over. Slap the word challenge on this and it will take over. Creators supporting creators challenge. Best youtubers iceburg challenge.  Best youtubers you have never heard of.
Heck yeah, Wizard's With Guns are criminally underrated.
Why scumbag dad at top?
Mad props for including value select and wizards with guns, amazing channels.
This guy content is just dissing youtubers he don't like lmao
Miss chance to have code say "FkSniperWolf100"
Left a like just for including Captain Disillusion! There were so many that you had to leave out for time sake, but some that comes to my mind are Scott The Woz, Wendigoon, Did You Know Gaming, Metatron and so on and so forth. Even outside of the English sphere there are so many good channels, like from the Italian community we have channels like Cydonia or La Biblioteca di Alessandria.
Love this, and would certainly be interested in similar recommendations of interesting channels in the future. So often it’s a matter of stumbling across a creator, especially with the algorithm these days.
Good vibes going 'round
Lilkirbs is good, but Ryukahr is my vote for best mario maker youtuber. (Also, love that my boy Dime Store Adventures got a shout-out. Seriously needs more love.)
where’s Tom Scott
Yay Wizards With Guns!
Don’t forget hourofpoop, he’s a great ytp guy
10:14 "I think you should Leave" reference? 😂
Wizards with Guns in the thumbnail? Now I know this list is gonna be good.
ranton gives the same energy as maxor with his Ultrakill playthrough/review/thing
JACK, Internet Archivist is an AWESOME youtuber who creates documentaries documenting youtube drama and is basically the the gravekeeper of the youtube graveyard. He's under 500k subs and underrrated. Cinderblacksally's youtube shorts for D&D dms is also really underrated and deserves a spotlight too!!!
Where's SamTime?
A dedicated shout out disguised as an iceberg video is surprisingly wholesome
I would love to recommend max0r as well
I don't see the bringus studio
No mention of The Why Files?? 🤯
@IFinishedAVideoGame is a channel that should have been on this list.
I'm glad Rantonipepperoni is getting some recognition
wheres joeygraceffa ??????
I would also reccomend DJ peach cobbler for this list, he is hilarious and throws hot takes like nothing else
Honestly, there are a ton of really amazingly talented creators that get overshadowed by weirder and lower effort channels.
vagrant holiday should be here
I would lile to recommend topm bated
Jack I've been watching you since the late 2000s, I remember when you reached a million subs, I remember a time before YGS and JackAsk (also thank you for responding to one of my questions on jackask, your reaction to it was gold) and I just wanted to thank you for being an actually good YouTuber.
Can I say I’m over 18 and just give the $100 to my mom’s PayPal
Viva La Dirt League is cool(and things)
I'd add max0r, his editing is just godlike
Value Select's content is beyond amazing and I am truly honored that the universe put my eyeballs and ears in the same timeline and place where his videos exist
Watched two Bobby Fingers videos upon hearing the recommendation and oh my god. This guy has good taste! I should probably check out all these channels, thank you!
The funny thing is that I have never even heard of every single channel on the iceberg 💀💀💀💀
Man Carry Thing is hilarious. He’s so creative.
God damnit Peter! What are you doing at 4:08?
Where the cancer crew at?
Lilkirbs deserves all the love
Nice to see some of my favorite YouTubers under the water
SickAnimation is truly an OG
Jackfilm PLEASE analyze the Garfield trailer i beg you, my life depends on it. feed it to me like a mother bird to her small insignificant child and hope that this is the one that will succeed in flying, set us free and let us see the light after years of waiting for the next cinematic breakthrough ever since july 28th 2017, allow us to be re-incarnated by giving us every single intricate detail and reference in the new trailer to garfong starring mario mario and whoever voices jon. give us the pure essence of bliss as you bestow your high quality analytical psychology tactics and unweave the deeper meaning of Garfling. Embed our brains with all the plot devices and relatable characters introduced in this snippet of cinematic history. i do not trust anyone with this power but you, as the man who has film in his name (jackFILMs, really sneaky there jack 😉) i don't know how much longer i can go without knowing how to interpret every scene of the trailer, what did they MEAN when Grimfeldor   said "If you have young children, this would be a good time for them to leave" i NEED to know jack.  so if you see this Jack "To The Future" Filmerson, go to twitch.tv, hit "Go Live", put on the trailer, and let us be free.
nightride is the best car channel
Welcome to iceberg lore 😁
@FireDepartmentChronicles , go check them out, its about firemen funny real encounter s and some funny sketch
Another great Youtuber is RunningShine, They make Amazing game reviews with some of the best comedic inbetweens I've ever had the pleasure to experience!
Captain Disillusion is literally actually goated on the sticks AND with the sauce
Man carry thing is an absolute legend. He never misses.
Yes! WIzards With Guns is on the list!! They're so funny and I'm so excited whenever I see them in collaborations or mentioned
why wasnt i on this list...unsubscribed and reported bro
Yeeeep tony zartes we are UP!
I love that you have ranton on here
TOM SCOTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where's videogame dunkey? This is preposterous. And with that, I walk.
no crackermilk?
WHAT ABOUT MY MAN HUGGBEES??????????
I fail. Please leave a nasty comment. But show everyone on stream so I can pretend to have people watching me.  In return, I'll.... Do something or whatever, idk.
my boy captain disillusion in the thumbnail!!! let’s go!!
Let's go Rantoni peperoni
Man Carrying Things is the best thing it has happened to my life in years. 10/10 will recommend
The Wizards made it boys! Praise Magius and Algorithmius!
This still doesn't answer the question of whether Tony Zaret is "bait"
How dare u tell everybody about bobby
While @Reloxard is good, we all know @cs188 has been the undisputed king for like a decade straight
4:03 Entirely random. But doesn't this guy look like if Matt Smith (11th Doctor, Doctor Who) was fused with Tom Holland?
been following tony zaret for years, so glad hes getting out there, the woke mob has been unchecked for too long
the delete me sponsorship is so perfect
No RedLetterMedia mention :(
Only channel I've ever heard from any of these is Captain Disillusion.  The rest don't seem like my kinda channels/content, lol.  Captain Disillusion is actually an intelligent feeling kind of channel. Many of the ones you showed here were just pre-teen, and young teen levels of poop comedy that should be left in 2010, lol.  Glad to see you're still doing well after dddoxerwolf's disrespectful behavior, and YouTube's subsequently disappointing follow-up behavior.  Shameful on both of them for treating an OG like you the way they did. Been with you since the very early days. YGS, was the best. Still feel like it should make a comeback, though.  Gen Z and Gen Alpha grammar has gotten so fucking bad, it needs the Second Coming of Jack.
I cannot tell if Tony Zaret is "Sad Tire" because of "Cole's Slaw"
Dude, seeing sick animation on the iceberg broke me
If you want more good YTPs and masterful sentence mixing I can't recommend VeryTallBart enough
Pls do a part 2 with actual good youtubers
There’s no eboys channel, it might be a mistake.
I’d put Natalie Sideserf in here. She makes hyper realistic cakes but not in a tutorial kinda way. She just tells stories while making them
We need more videos like this to gide us and keep us from consuming all the trash that is on YouTube
Could I have a shoutout in the under 100 subs section thanks
Value Select is the deepest I recognized except for RSK (thanks JJJacksfilms)
Thankyou for including me jack!
Wizards with Guns maded on the iceberg, Hell Yeah!
CEASE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS
I've been following Tony Zaret on Instagram for years. Glad to see him get recognition. Also been following Valueselect and Skycorp for a long time and I believe channels like these are what Youtube was made for. Sad they don't promote skit channels as much anymore. They would've been massive if they started uploading in 2012
Value select lets go!
Man carrying gun AND Wizards with things?? That's two of my favs!!
tony zaret mentioned! tony is a great creator and he has gotten some attention and notoriety on tumblr, really happy to know he's appreciated elsewhere as well
Thank you for making this video, and for your very well-intentioned exposure challenge for other creators on the rise. @DoktorSkipper is a rare gem that I would have statistically never been able to find ever. I am now going down your list and checking out a few videos from everyone (other than CD and Kirbs, because you introduced me to CD many years ago, and the YT algorithm is not always ___)
It was nice to see Man Carrying Things in there, also discovered a few new ones The absolute legend, he never misses
we gotta acknowledge people like @studsonstudio and @northoftheborder
im so glad captain d is getting the recognition he deserves
This is an internet service. And that's the thing Jack makes this place better when so many other people are making it worse
I love Man Carrying Thing. Was excited when I saw his face on the iceberg haha
maybe bring up more women next time.
Honestly great to see someone he saw on bingo on this list
Take my word for i vouch for bobby fingers!
How did I know so many of them am happy about
I would personally add Ssethzeentach to the above 1M list, his content is really really good just that edgy review content is not for everyone and his mentally stunted method of reviewing video games, I really love it because of this.
I can't find the playlist link. Can anyone help?
what about intezga????
I am SO GLAD just seeing Skycorp Homevideo's logo in the intro. These people deserve so many more subs and views, their content is absolutely amazing. It's a shame their current revenue is hindering their content quantity creation.
No joel haver 😥
Ranton is just max0r but without as much lsd.
4:08 Peter?? I swear to god....
Another one is audio opera some of the funniest shorts on the whole site
Bobby Fingers just hit 100K 🥳 I wonder how much this video helped
Joel Haver :(
I think Casual Geographic 100% belongs on this list! He's so good!
I'm so happy you mentioned Dime Store Adventures! I've been subscribed to him for a while now.
Is he qualified?, oh he didn't need to because this is appreciation, and i agree about everything
my boy Bobby Fingers! so glad he's up here... I was in the MJ video (I gave advice on the scaffold build)
Holy damn ranton is here 🔥🔥🔥
I have been watching Value select ever since your last video recommended him, love the guy’s stuff
This is such a great video! I follow many of these fine folks, but now I know about them all! Thank you!
THIS IS AWESOME
This content is really really really really fucking good
I love that for Man Carrying Things you used the video that is referring to you! He's fantastic!
good video
me im the best youtuber
I discovered Value Select from your first vid on him and he’s been one of my favorite people to follow over the past few years. So creative, so dedicated and so god damn fucking funny
I'll tale Jack's recommendations over the algorithm any day! Here's to the creatives!
Shoutout to Man Carrying Thing for bringing me here by mentioning that you shouted him out!  (Also I'll admit I totally thought Tony Zaret had more subs. Honestly the first several times I heard about Skibidi Toilet was from his YouTube community posts so I entirely thought it was just an in-joke he'd made up and not an actual thing for genuinely months. Tbh I want to go back to that time as I enjoyed thinking of it as that much much more.)
Because im terminally online, i already knew almost all of these channels. Didnt stop my enjoyment of the video, hightened it actually. ThereIRuinedIt is probably my favorite of all these, but they are all bangers. Good stuff
Recognize a lot of these, but shout out to LilKirbs. I hope to get to his skill level one day!
I see we’re gatekeeping YouTube now…awesome… 🙄
w
Ekatarina is questionable because she gives away magical intellectual property that's not her's.
Almost Friday TV do have some great sketches. 👍
Lilkirbs
Almost Friday TV do have some great sketches. 👍
When will jacksfilms analyze Shrek 1995 test footage frame by frame?
Bobby Fingers is one of the greatest channels I have ever seen.
Challenge: watch every video from all these channels
This is really cool. You're a good dude, Jack.
My boys wwgs are here!
Love this, elevating good creators, and soft launching a fully OC react series that promotes small creators, putting a new spin on the typical streamer ylyl payout vids
I'm so happy about this.
First time ive seen anybody mention wizards with guns! And it drives me crazy those guys deserve all the love
The Ekaterina one is funny as there's a whole group of magicians trying to get her cancelled for teaching magic secrets.
i recommend I Did A Thing and I Go By Lots Of Names
Thank you ☺️ lovely to discover other creators 💪
Nah, Internet Comment Ettiquet went aggressively woke a few year ago. Drove away a large portion of his audience the more beligerant and divisive he took it.
I have been a fan of wizards with guns for a while, absolutely banger channel
Appreciate the positivity in this video.🎉
Shouting out some great channels on here. I've followed SkyCorp for years, and it is honestly one of the best channels on YouTube.
Tbh, when I first found JacksFilms in 2016 I thought he was ripping off PewDiePie's content by making his own version of LWIAY (I was 16-17 back then and for me, Internet was a new thing). But now, his content is starting to grow on me after the whole Sssniperwolf dumpster fire, because I didn't find his channel for while now.
I love how I know some of the channels you mentioned, like Man Carrying Thing and There I Ruined It! and also lovely to see you shout out RSK again :)
@AlmostFridayTV is CRIMINALLY underexposed. Everyone should know about them. Funny and somehow wildly impressive.
Um where lemmino
Where is Cadicarus???
wizards with guns is genuinely my favorite channel on the platform and im so happy they've been included in this list
Nice to see Skycorp getting some love!  Been a fan of theirs for ages now.  They deserve more recognition.
Jack should become the ceo of YouTube
I wont lie, I expeçted Dan Bull and Scott the Wozz here
As a comedy video creator myself, this is such an awesome video! It's always great to see bigger creators giving some attention to smaller ones. Even if you never come across my channel, I'm still happy to see others like me getting some well deserved attention. I'm not really interested in the contest though. I've dealt with enough attorneys tyvm 😅
I'm suprised you didn't talk about jr. egg
the only channel i can possibly think of that should've been included is probably Scott the Woz, otherwise my other suggestions boil down to personal preference and tastes in content
more creators need to make videos like this, just uplifting other creators and sharing good content without relying on the algorithm. i really hope you make another
Awesome. I approve this message.
i’ve watched wizards with guns for as long as i know. they’re amazing and i watch every video they uploald so underrated
No way, jack didn’t mentioned "internet historian" and "Gayford"
yes man carrying thing and scumbagdad!
TONY ZARET YESSSS
3 seconds in. Marc M on the list. Hype.
Bet
PEEP OUT TALL BART @verytallbart
I just want your nasty comment
wait wizards with guns has less than 1 mil?
Live laugh love tony zaret
Jacksfilms earning respect by doing good and being modest! Finally some soul in this rat race.
Almost Friday TV is my hidden gem goat recommendation whenever someone tells me they're bored and they wanna watch something new
All of these YouTubers suck
can i be on it ?
4:07 I swear to god, Peter!
I've been with Mr. Fingers since the very beginning, and it is no surprise that his channel will be destined to grow exponentially in the coming years.
captain dissaloisim is a goat
3 best YouTubers IMO are   1) CGP GREY 2) CAPTAIN DISILLUSION 3) LEMMINO
TiL jack is easily entertained by adhd editing.
i fucking love value select thanks for featuring them
I thought i was watching tuv's video because of the voice 💀
So how long before one of these channels is outed for being a nazi? (it seems to happen to at least one channel whenever there's a lot of recs)
I love when Jack does this, he did something similar a while back and it helped me find one of my favorite YouTubers.
It’s a sin that Scott the Woz wasn’t included
They are good cuz
4:07 is that peter from smosh
Matt colbo really needs to be on that list!
Love to see the Wizards with Guns respect! Their sketches are absolutely hilarious and I've always felt that they should be more recognized.
Im glad that you mentioned Tony "Zaret" (funny man who makes videos for GUYS!)
please add bhultra if you end up doing another one of these, he has below 100k and does very well crafted documentaries
There I Ruined It is amazing. Bill McClintlock is another musical mashup master here on the Tube.
Mr Mobile or Captain 2 phones has been on my subscriber list for YEARS. He’s amazing
Scumbag Dad videos went from chaotic adventures with a scumbag dad and a child to some very creative crossovers
If you like lilkirbs, you'll love switchpalacecorner and other TGM (Tetris: The Grand Master) players.
Says worlds best Mario maker player… doesn’t show video game dunkey
Where's Sssssssniperwoolf  💀 ah no, she's infront of my house, and I live in Philippines how
Funny how scumbagdad is on top of the iceberg 😅
I like big yellow. One day he will talk about fighting games, next tomodachi life and then the purple brick from lego.
Wizards with Guns is so funny and their interrogation parodies are extremely convincing until the breaking point where you realize you’re an idiot or you see the channel
But where’s Joel Haver???
channels sold so well that it encouraged me to watch some of these channels months ago
Bobby Fingers will go down one of the greatest channels in YT history
Tony zaret 😭😭😭
Ranton is good, and he's going to be doing the ultimate self defense championship season 2
What a great video. I knew about some of these creators but now how so many others that I can enjoy.
Yooooo wizards with guns gotta be one of the funniest channels I've seen on yt
This gives me hope for the future of creativity on the internet
So the Swedish vlogger in japan with you over 10mil subs doesn't count. Got it. Doesnt need the shoutout.
The Friday Beers boys are my favorite in the game rn, their production value is insane, even for the most random, insane premises. Wizards with Guns is a close second!
As a tony zaret fan, thank you. He is so underrated
You mean December 6th
Krugston is also an amazing youtube animator which might have the best animation on the platform.
Wizards with Guns and Almost Friday TV are the peak of modern YouTube comedy
Awesome picks! I think some other awesome YouTubers are Microwave Society, Life of Boris, Modest Pelican, Jeffaplier🎉🎉
4:08 THAT'S PETER FROM SMOSH WTF
so happy Wizards made the list, they're one of the funniest "just some guys doing skits" style comedy channels
sigh, tony zaret is mainstream now, time to pack up.
Dime Store Adventures is so good.
BOBBY FINGERS MENTION!!!!!!!
These are all good channels, and there are far too many good YouTubers in almost every genre. I think you right amount of YouTubers and they all have a great quality.
I love you FOREVER for including scumbagdad
0:28 “last week, JimboLips was caught”
I have to throw in a recommendation for In/Frame/Out. It's some of the best movie analysis on here and they have criminally few subscribers.
Big Mike!
@camiidae should be up here makes uncredible music.
matthewmatosis, dnsl, and companyman don’t miss
Captain disillusioned is hr GOAT for me in  youtube content
That’s awesome to see there I ruined it!
how dare you not call me, with a whopping 0 videos, an actually good youtuber?????????
This is such a good idea for a video. Thanks for making this.
Awesome vid jacks. Thanks- Love, formerly known as Slut Bucket.
No A-mart :(
Awesome new content! Love to see how you've brought such a positive light to this whole situation.
4:08 It’s “Peter, I swear to God!”!! 😂
I know most of these guys. I don't know how to feel about that. Should I leave my house? Should I touch grass?
Shoutout for the Weird Explorer. The guy's whole youtube is just him reviewing every fruit he can find in the world. Just very niche but enjoyable.
I’ve been watching Man Carrying Thing for awhile, thanks for giving them a shoutout!
very happy to see ranton featured in the video, he is an AMAZING content creator!
Shout out to Daniel Bautista and David Hoffman for still being passionate youtube content creators despite getting less attention than they deserve
Dani  You know Watch him
Wizards with Guns is so underrated
this is actually one of the most noble pursuits i’ve seen on this god forsaken website, godspeed jack
YEESSSS BOBBY FINGERS
I flippin love wizards with guns
Clicked specifically for captain disillusion. Not very often he gets the recognition he deserves
Oh, God, I wanna submit a video, now... If nothing else, I'll get roasted by Jacksfilms... Win/win 😉
WIZARDS WITH GUNS MENTIONED🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I wouldnt be surprised if many of the sketch and music channels were inspired by PMS
when I first came across Wizards with Guns, I thought they were 1mil+ youtubers but I was actually completely shocked when I saw they were still under 200k. I binged their whole channel
Felt reassuring to essentially be told I watch good channels
This list only shows me that we don’t use YouTube the same way lol
TONY ZARET OH MY GOODNESS
Massive fan of both Man Carrying Thing and Tony Zaret
the 'There I ruined it' channel situation is sad
Fuck yeah Almost Friday TV made it on!
I like your intention Jack, but if you REALLY want to help smaller Youtubers then what you should have done is to reupload their videos on your channel, maybe with your face in a corner so that I can watch everything here instead of going to their channels at all, which is DEFINITELY the BEST way to support any of them
Why do i know most of of the YouTubers here?!?!
Absolutely love it!
Almost Friday TV goated
What hilarious timing for that sponsor, gotta make sure the internet doesnt know...  Also JHXC64 is really cool :)
You forgot Yotam Perel!
I've been following dimestore for about the danger time. What a great channel
2 channels that come to mind i love under 2 mil are Quinton reviews and emplemon
glad to see skipper here
I'm re-watching this video again 100%, love this creator curation
Jack you gotta check out MDE.
Rantoni Pepperoni!!
Tony Zaret is a legend
Daryl Talks Games is another channel i woudl definitely put on simmielr quality to these guys, he makes good stuff
you should check out skeleton realm they make some of the most confusing but also funniest stuff ive ever seen, and they do it all LIVE
Love Mr Mobile, he makes actual reviews instead of just reading the specs to you.
almost friday tv is such a banger machine  Their skits are both poetic and funny
yes
Please please make another one of these!!
MrMobile already has some audience before he made his channel because his stint on PocketNow
Truly honored to be counted among such talented company. Thanks so much for the shout, and for the excellent recommendations!
I love to see Almost Friday TV and Wizards With Guns on this, I love their content and I think their sketch comedy is really unique and funny when compared to any other sketch comedy channel on the platform
My boy Nerd City not on here? Sacrilege.
not even a hundred subs? that's almost a hundred...
I may have 7k subs but my content is HORRIBLE
I love this era of Jack being like "I got my bag, let's help others get theirs"
Jack is exactly what YouTube needs right now. Helping other creators, as oppose to stealing from them.
"I don't see many hyperedited music videos like this" Bill Wurtz:
why no ollenoboguh?
I’d like to recommend  ssethtzeentach, ordinary things, Mogswamp, Martincitopants
I knew Captain Disillusion, There I Ruined It, Lilkirbs, and Doctor Skipper. I recommend  Luck Is Me, uricksaladbar, dankpods, razbuten, BobbyBroccoli, EllyProductions, slowstart, Deoxide, DeadlyComics, faxjam, James Lee, and Zalinki for now
wow jack, a shout out to Tony Zaret AND an ITYSL themed contest, you are truly a youtuber after my own heart
imagine if you included wavetro and worthikids
Thank you for supporting my boys Wizards with Guns, they deserve it
Wizards with guns is so underrated
Jack I truly mean it when I say that you represent everything that's great about youtube. Thank you for being a source of entertainment for the better part of two decades (how crazy is that by the way) and thank you for using the platform to help other creators. Much love and thanks for the recommendations :)
This is awesome. You made a playlist of cool channels to check out, thank you sir.
My favorite Wizards with Gun video is their bomb salesman video. Or their sand real estate video. Or their poop dick video. Or their shark tank video. Or their …
thank you for giving the captain his long-deserved recognition of having some of the highest quality content on the entire internet
man gets his address leaked and uses a sponsor for deleting personal information, lol love you jack.
Bajookistani residents, stand up for King Zaret….
This whole list got me bouncing on my boys iceberg until it melts and floods Arizona
Holy shit sick animation
THE LAUGHING SIMON. Hes got less than 50 thousand subs. He needs 1 million
Jack is genuinely a good dude. Youtube is better with JacksFilms
Good work fam❤
i could be on this iceberg, maybe.
I think CJ the X would be a good addition to this list. They make longform art analysis videos, with a fast paced, witty, and smart talking style. They don’t have a lot of graphics in their videos, a lot of it is just them talking to the camera, but they don’t NEED graphics to keep you engaged. Highly recommend.
Heck yeah, Value Select and Man Carrying Thing are sick
jack went from simply being an og grandmaster to being both a pariah and a true paragon of the platform. thanks for being an unexpected light in the dark, jack&fans
I love this video. Every iceberg video on YouTube is 2+ hours long, this was a very succinct but valuable iceberg video that you don't see often.
Jerryrigeverything?
Another Youtuber I'd reccomend is Alasdair Beckett-King. Super funny videos
Amazing video! Just one question though, how has Value Select replied to what seems like a quarter of the total comments!? There’s over 1000 comments and like every fifth one has a Value Select reply. Wow. Just wow.
💗💗💗
Great video, Jack. All of these youtubers are so unique and fun. Keep up the good work.
Tony Zaret is one of the only guys on YouTube that makes me laugh 100 percent of the time.
NOT THE JIMBO LIPS MUSIC 😭😭😭😭
Wheres ghetto smosh?
Honestly thank you for doing this.   So much of this site is just crap now, and there are people out there still trying
REPPING SICK ANIMATION FOR EVER
totally criminal bobbyfingers has less than 100k subscribers... guy produced masterpiece after masterpiece, granted his releases are slow but they're quality
Yo, Jack great vid, but have you ever heard of Skeleton Realm? Goated channel with less than 10k.
The fact that EmpLemon and B-mask weren't on this list is a tragedy
That I think you should leave reference at the end of the video was perfect
MAN CARRYING THING LFGGGGGG
Sadly there i ruined it has privated their videos for 90 days due to copy right
where dunkey
Glad to see Mr Mobile getting some love. He has been my favorite Tech YouTuber ever since he was with PocketNow.
My favorite Wizards With Guns videos are the magic item salesman
I feel like MCT is special because, like his in-fandom joke says, he literally never misses at his social critique and parody. Social parody?
Dude!!!!  He shouted out Tony Zaret!! Finally the stardom he's always deserved!
I see ranton, i press like
I don't wanna be that guy, but.. ᴮᵘᵐᵇˡᵉˢᴹᶜᶠᵘᵐᵇˡᵉˢ I never said anything.
So glad I made it in every entry. Thanks a lot Jack!
i farted
If I had to reccomend someone for the depths, I'd give a big shoutout to Leo Vader. His imaginative commentary videos never cease to grab my attention. His lore and world building is so interesting, wanting to have a deeper story and reasoning to his creation of videos that extends beyond his personal life. He sits at 190k and I believe will only continue to grow.
How is SuperEyepatchWolf not on here???
There I ruined it was one I've liked for a few months. Those music videos were hilarious.  Oh Lil Kirbs was always awesome too.
The new feature of YouTube recommending small channels is so good. I love finding all these small gems, even if I have to deal with crap sometimes.
Imagine you're me and you're not in this video. Fake Iceberg, badly researched lol.
I love wizards with guns, glad to see they got mentioned
Where's jacknjellify
WHERE'S DANTDM
"Still wide screen as the good lord intended" hahaha
TONY ZARET RAHHHHGHGHHGHH YAYYYYYYYYYY
Thank you so much for the shout-out, Jack!  I am glad you enjoyed my video. EDIT: No longer in "The Floor". Thank you, Jack!
This video is top tier YouTube.
Hey, couldn’t help but notice you said that Tony Zarets content had a layer of irony. But truly we can never know if it’s ironic because of Poe Slaw
HELL YEAH RANTON MENTION
Unfortunately, you cannot tell if Tony Zaret is joking or not because of "Poe's law"
Love the mention of value select, been watching him for years now, no one does it like him!
i just want to mention Ahoy, some of the best on youtube :D https://www.youtube.com/@XboxAhoy    also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BZLz21ZS_Y
If you like The Last Airbender, Overanalyzing Avatar is a very cool channel where this super passionate guy goes through every episode of avatar and gives his thoughts. Its my favourite channel.
where is videogamedunkey
Oh hell yeah Lumpytouch!
Gotta throw Ordinary Things into that shallow water pool
thanks for sharing, thanks for supporting small(er) creators! feels way more organic and successful (in terms of content i actually like...) to discover good content through someone you already know and trust than an algorithm trying to force feed you recycled formulaic vids from the most massive channels on the platform
OMG I'm so glad you included Value Select in here! He's been one of my favorites for a little over a year now, and I definitely think he deserves more love!
SHOUTOUT TO CAPTAIN KRB
i love that i recognized at least wizards with guns and value select instantly (edit i also know man carrying thing)
Love videos like these
Thanks, Jack. At last I can escape the algorithm.
why isn't Wendigoon on here please fix this jack
meow
Best episode of stuff Phil likes in years.
I met Value Select, Jazz Emu, and the gang in person a few years ago and can confirm they are the salt of the earth. Hung out after the show and chatted for a solid 15-20min
You should checkout GrogTV, he makes lots of videos with car games and their edited pretty well. Very underated
i would argue vsauce may be the goat of ‘good ytbers’
I have such an odd degree or respect for DeleteMe sponsoring JacksFilms right now. It's fitting, good and authentic.
So glad to see our shining boy Value "Max Renner" Select and WWG, in the thumbnail no less
I had to make sure Bobby Fingers was on the list, HE IS THE GOAT!!!
I'm not going to bother stating the name of my other channel because at this point I really don't want the attention.  I stood up for Jacksfilms on my other channel where I have been uploading videos for the past three years, on multiple occasions and then he puts out a video asking for people to send him videos, so on my other channel i did that very thing. What does he do? He deletes my comment. I asked him why he deleted my comment and he deleted that too. Jacksfilms, I've unsubbed from your channels and I just don't understand what I did to offend you.  Maybe YouTube is a club that I don't belong in because it feels like a clique. It's not only because of you, but this is one of many factors that made me decide to use a different platform to post my videos. I also just don't care for this platform in general. I don't know why I bothered typing this, Jack is going to delete this comment too, which is ironic because it makes him seem so disingenuous to his wanting to provide a spotlight to small channels and creators.
Cyriac Harris, Ze Frank, Felix Colgrave, Film Cow,
I can't believe Sssniperwolf isn't on here
I really expected a giant shitpost, but I'm glad to see you shouting out good creators.
shout outs to Almost Friday TV man they have been killing it
Where am i
I've been a wizards with guns fan for YEARS and I'm so glad people are finding out about them
please do a part two! there are so many undiscovered gems that dont get enough attention, if you do end up making a part two, someone i recommend is dantavius. His editing and the way he goes about the topics keeps it entertaining but not over the top, great video jack!
I didn't really watch the whole video, not sure if I was included, but if you're gonna make a part two, can you please include my channel, or my other channels, or all of them, which is @RiceKrisShorts, @RiceKrisBrand and also @RiceKrisYT, and I might create other ones such as @RiceKrisVlogs... I might.
This legit feels like oldschool youtube here, a creator shouting others out.
I got a really weird sense of pride when I realised just how many of these channels I'm already subscribed to~
I MAY BE ONLY 14 YEARS OLD BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO WIN THOSE 100 SMACKEROONIES JACK
based off of this video jack would love Zack Freedman. If you see this jack i would highly recommend taking a look at his amazeballs work
DUDE I LOVE WIZARDS WITH GUNS SO MUCH I SHOWED MY BEST FRIEND AND HIM AND ME HAD SOME OF THE BEST LAUGHS EVER
Happy to see Tony Zaret getting well deserved love
DUUUDE THERES NO WAY YOU MENTIONED DOKTOR SKIPPER
I wsnt subbed to a single one of these youtubers before this
Tony Zaret mentioned‼️‼️
Damn I love Tony Zaret. I mainly know him from Reddit posts.
Prob in the upper tier I'd put Wendigoon (really long videos talking about obscure culture things in the most friendlike way possible) and Emperor Lemon (best videos ever, period). Then in the middle tier my boy TBSkyen (character analysis reviews). Please check them out if you don't know them yet.
I would add a few, Scott the woz, Dankpods casual geographic, upisnotjump. Their content is very well polished and genuinely entertaining to watch. I feel there are very few YouTubers that are very high quality. Not to diss the iceberg you made but if thought I’d shout out a few more YouTubers
I'm shocked Joel Haver isn't on this list but i'm also super excited to go down a rabbit hole with who you mentioned :D
Great job John👍
Every couple of months I search for 'Marry My Dad' by Value Select.  It's been one of my favourite videos for the past few years.  Never fails to crack a smile out of me.
vagrant holiday when?
WIZARDS WITH GUNS HELL YEAH
As a long time fan of both yours, and a few of the "surface" youtubers... I *really* appreciate you making this video (as well as what you're doing with the new direction of JJJacksfilms). More of this please :)
Ayyyyy! Captain disillusion in the thumbnail! :D
I see no coryxkinshin
no nerd city is crazy
Value select is crazy good.
Sick animation was such a huge part of my childhood I’m glad he’s still around
I'm just gonna drop some YouTube channels that I really love here (in no particular order), for anybody interested!  1. BobbyDukeArts (very wholesome, very funny man who creates genuinely amazing sculptures/carvings/etc) 2. Tasting History With Max Miller (another wholesome and funny man, but this one cooks historical recipes while deep diving into the time periods they come from) 3. Drawfee (a wonderful group of friends who goof while they make digital art together, often using prompts chosen from viewers; things like "drawing the weirdest local news headlines we could find" or "artists draw Pokémon from memory") 4. ZeFrank1 (a guy who makes hilarious but VERY informative videos about animals) 5. The Urban Rescue Ranch (Uncle Farmer Dad Ben makes videos about the wildlife rehabilitation facility that he runs, which started out as a crack house; he's also got some lovable permanent critters on the ranch, like Kevin the Rhea and Dababy the Kangaroo, who make frequent appearances) 6. Lindsay Nikole (awesome lady who deep dives into some really interesting stuff about animals and evolution).
Ermmm actually, you forgot Gillbear 🐻❗️
Why am I not in this list
1:20 Max0r is kinda similar. I love his ultrakill videos
Wizards with Guns and Man Carrying Thing are my favorites on this list.     WWG did this sketch on Taco Bell 🔔  that was just too funny 😄
Leaving out Lemmino and Hbomberguy is bold
Really validating when you are subbed to a lot of the smaller channels already. You did miss a few smaller actually good channels tho so I can not forgive you
I subbed to WWG earlier this year, great stuff!
checked out every channel and really loved all of your suggestions jake! what a great mixture of incredible content!
idk if its just commentary youtubers he's talking about but I know this one guy who has made a whole animated movie and series and is making another movie and it is baffling that they have under 100k subs their name is Jonni Phillips
Thank you Jacksfilms for this content & the opportunity.  It seems I’m currently underneath your iceberg and it’s pretty cold down here.  Cheers!
Are there going to be any royalty free Xmas songs this year?!
Already subscribed to RSK❤❤❤
so far, every channel i’ve checked out from this list has been an absolute banger. thank you for existing, jack, youre such an amazing source of humor
High boy is reccomended
The gospel of bajookieland will expand
I'm somehow proud that I know and support most these channels already :)
Ummmm where is asmongold 🤔🤔🤔
hmm
FINALLY somebody knows who Wizards with guns are
Super proud of Jack for taking this channel in a new direction in such an innovative and exciting way. I can imagine when contemplating this concept, it seemed like a lot of work for a video that might not do well. But dammit, he's doing it and putting in the work for the community. Respect.
VALUE SELECT MENTIONED RAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Those peeps all reek like Bunk smelly cracks and pits
Jack is a diamond in the rough. Truly. .•*:•:*
yes, i love to see the WWG shout out. absolutely my favorite sketch comedy group and deserve far more attention
Why am I not on the iceberg 🥲
Alright, they all have another subscriber. Now it's up to them not to lose me 😁
Can I also recommend James Lee because it is a fucking travesty that he doesn't have more attention, as a guy from the fucking newgrounds days who has consistently put out good, UNIQUE, and INCREDIBLY SKILLED content for years upon years
Interesting, didn’t know jacksfilms watched man carrying things.
This was perfection ❤
Bobby Fingers was at 85.9 subs at the time of the making of this. 3 hours since video's been out, he's up nearly 15k. By the time MOST people watch this video, he'll no longer qualify for this iceberg tier
There’s no way Tony Zaret just got a Jacksfilms shoutout
OH MY GOESH ITS TONY ZARET
Loved recognizing some of the talented creators here in this video! Glad they’re getting the attention they deserve 🙌💥💥
Wow Jack, this is so awesome, thanks so much for including me in the video! It is seriously uplifting to get a shout-out like this. Lots of other real interesting sounding youtubers to check out in here too!
Dude, half of the people on this list I have already watched and unfortunately haven't remembered them, but now this video makes me wanna go back and watch their content...
Tony Zaret is so underrated, the first time I discovered his channel I just spent hours watching everything and laughing my ass off
I saw ranton and i IMMEDIATELY got excited
Amazing video! ❤
Damn it, I'm below 18 (No, I was a fan of his channel before Sssniperwolf doxxed him, and a bunch of people out of nowhere suddenly became aware of his existence), so I can't pass in one of my Zelda TV memes. Jacksfilms probably wouldn't laugh, but at least I would've gotten a comment from him.  Of course, that is assuming I got accepted in the first place.
No russian badger?
"I just ate $1,000,000 of solid gold, just to see, what it would do to my tum tum!!!!" - strong Mr. Beast vibes here. Also, Gold is inert - so it wouldn't do anything, you just have to clean up 1,000,000 of gold after nasty and disturbing session on the pot. Or have one clean it up. Is that a MrBeast Video Idea? I'l.l DM him.
Jack, have you already covered Jeffiot?! He only has 5.3k subs but he is outrageously talented and funny. He has created a few successful args.
Finally wizards with guns is Finally getting some well deserved attention
Rennsreviews (with two N-s) is also a gem game review boy
One thing about magicians is that while I understand their desire not to reveal tricks; the actual reveal makes it more incredible because it isn't magic but just pure skill and showmanship and that is far more impressive.
Also me 👋🏻🙂
I absolutely love man carrying thing lol
I LOVE HOW IVE BEEN WATCHING THE YTP CHANNEL AND I SAW YOU COMMENT AND NOW YOU POST IT HERE MWAHAHAHA WHOLESOME
VERY excited to see Man Carrying Thing on there, been watching him since the early days (even collabed a few times) and he is one of a kind!
Yes!!! Tony Zaret!!!! Awooooo!!! I Stan Tony.  Edit: If anyone says this comment is cringe, guess what? It was Bait! Mwahaha
Genuinely can’t believe Leo Vader isn’t on here.
I get what he's going for, but i fucking hate scumbagdads content, intentionally cringe videos are still cringe videos
3:23 not true actually. Videogamedunkey is the best Mario make player. Didn’t you know he has the world record on the level bowsers big bean burrito
Ngl I kinda expected Pyrocynical to see here. Especially his video essays are a great watch
Adding Sod and Olivia to the list of underrated channels!
YESSS new JF! ❤
Im the worst-best YouTuber.
Happy to see love for Man Carrying Iceberg! He also does longer videos mostly dedicated to book reviews. I thought I should mention that as that's how his channel started, and he's still passionate about books.
Wtf why is this just my subs tab? Literally all my fav creators!
You missed DougDoug
Quick, we need to protect toner zaret from all the mainstream woke soyboys and keep him niche!!!
I'd also like to shout out MiniMinuteMan. Not only is he hilarious, but his videos trick you into learning archeology.
I’m so glad Tony Zaret made it on here
man carrying thing and jacksfilms collabed last night in my dreams
I wonder if you considered putting RLM at the top of this, or at least their new clips channel before they decided to nuke it and pretend it never happened. I guess you've spread their gospel enough already as it is.
this needs a part 2
is jacksfilms aware of max0r?
I’ve been waiting for a list of good YouTubers like this! Thank you Jack!
I've been suggested the Morshu video for weeks now, and, after having finally watched it, have to say that it's worth the 23.33333333333333% of your week
So happy to see Man Carrying Thing make a cameo in the JCU (Jack Cinematic Universe)
Jack please for the love of god watch Jazz Emu, please and thankzzzz
Genius Jack! You found a medium that people enjoy while promoting creators!
JoshWickPlays is such an underrated gem, his editing is so good and his content is very entertaining (at least to me)
Where’s max0r
Love Skycorp, but I think you don't get it. They aren't a comedy channel. These are clearly instructional tapes to played at school/church/work depending on what's needed.   /s
Where are Tyler Tube, Freakin Reviews, Stuff Made Here and the Lock Picking Lawyer?
Gg Jack
Love to see wizards with guns and Friday beers. Espically Wizards with guns tho. Oh and also Friday beers. But you can't forget about Wizards with Guns.
I watch this channel called Hydraulic Beanbag, really good animations
Great list of Youtubers! Brutalmoose is also another underrated youtuber i would like getting more exposure
I guess you could call it a....Niceberg.
I believe gamergod88 is the greatest Mario maker player but thank you for the shoutout!
Absolute amazing xontent, fast and straightfoward with the iceberg, its good to see you back Jack. 👍
Us Manheads been watching him carrying things since ‘05
Holy shit Tony Zaret recognition is beautiful and i am so glad to see some of it
Jack is doing his best to undo "She who shall not be named"'s damage
Captain and MCT ❤❤❤
Very Tall Bart and Moon Channel are ones I’d add to the iceberg (both in the abyss section)
As an Irish person who has watched bobby fingers go from a local smalltime artist on the internet through his rubberbandits band, it feels surreal to see him being shouted out by Jacksfilm (who is also a youtuber i have been watching for a long time)
This is honestly the best!! So many creators to check out now
No RedLetterMedia huh? You surprised me.
Using your platform to support/praise/reveal lesser known channels that deserve it is such a great thing to do. This is awesome. Also yes, I highly recommend Captain Disillusion and Man Carrying Thing
No matter how many subs captain disillusion has, he's still underrated!
Skycorp Home Video is unironically one of the best channels on the platform. His humour is unmatched in its uniqueness.
People who watched him edit this on stream 🤭
Technology Connections better be on the list, one of the most blessed channels out there
3:22 I'm sorry but in terms of SMM technicallity, the undisputed champion is ChainChompBraiden, the only one to ever, past present and future, beat trials of death. 7 fucking years. It's prolly been like a year or 2 since he did that and it's still baffling just to think about. Just. Wow.
Value Select is going to vanish from the platform soon... and im going to greatly miss him
I saw InternetCommentEtiquette eat a bowl of soup in Napa California wearing his own merch, didn't get to say hi :(
Recognised Sick Animation immediately.   Sprankton, a noun.
O shit, a product from Abine. Thats a nice surprise
i’m so happy i knew most of these
Greel
notice how jacksfilms isn't on the iceberg
Wizards with guns aren’t being treated fairly
I love There I Ruined It. Been watching for a year or 2
Sigh. I did 10 Second Quickies 13 Years ago.
Based Rantoni Baloni recommendation
lilkirbs represent
What a great video 😁 Sending love from Bajookieland ❤❤
I wish Hivemind was mentioned
the best on youtube: the VAPE
I did not expect to see Tony Zaret.
universal is actually useless
I know so many great underrated youtubers to put on this list that make great content. One of them is someone i know you know Jack and i am wondering why Ryan George is not included on this list?
Finally man carrying thing gets some recognition
3:27 second to Panga
You’ve got Lumpytouch, you’ve got my attention
i've been watching value select for sooo soo long so happy to see him here
Jack, you will LOVEEE “bizlychannel”. I found him on my recommendation tab 4 months ago and his content really hooked me immediately after just watching the first 20 seconds of his Stealth Games video.
Should have put atomic Shrimp in there as well
crazy that jack likes the same youtubers that i watch
let's not forget Sumito Media!
TONY ZARET LETS GOOO
I'm so glad you mentioned Dime Store Adventures!! They've been my comfort content for a while, it's astounding he still has so few subs.
I don’t know any of these channels so I genuinely can’t tell if these channels are meant to be amazing or terrible.   But one of my favourite channels on the smaller side is “Shoot from the hip”. They do improv acting and it’s bloody hilarious. I very much recommend them.   The smallest channel I am subbed to is Burn the Ladder with 63 subscribers. They make music and just released an album two weeks ago. I really like their songs Speak of Water and Lions in the Grass.
Jack out here doing amazing work! Very curious what people will come up with for the 10-second video challenge
Can we take a moment to appreciate how Jack makes us take a moment to appreciate underrated YouTube creators
HIVEMIND DESERVES A PLACE ON THIS LIST
Today's sponsor sure is something else, glad that it worked
Jack profiting off of getting doxxed like a king
I loved the video but will not watch a single short. I was here for youtubers not tiktokers
missed Mia Cole
Tony Zaret is a fed, take em off the list.
caaapptaaain disillussioooon
Didn't even know I needed this.
I had to really pay attention to the above 1 Mil channels
I've always loved Tony Zaret, so glad you gave him a shout out
3:41 so glad to see someone mention this guy and how well he carries thing
chuggaconroy not being here is criminal
EVERYONE IS HERE!!
Daddy jack film pls include me
Shouldn't a good YouTuber iceberg be made by a good YouTuber, Mr. John's Movies??
TONY ZARET MENTIONED!!!
Tony Zaret IS for me.  If Tony Zaret has million number of fans i am one of them . if Tony Zaret has ten fans i am one of them. if Tony Zaret have only one fan and that is me . if Tony Zaret has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth . if world against the Tony Zaret, i am against the world. i love #TonyZaret till my last breath.. .. Die Hard fan of Tony Zaret . Hit Like If you Think Tony Zaret Best YouTuber & Smart In the world
Value select is king
Isn’t Ranton the ex monk?
unfortunately the links in the description are broken :(
People you mentioned in the YouTuber awards he did a few years ago have really popped off since. You have a great influence, keep it up!
God bless jacksfilms for doing what the algorithm won’t… showing me new content I want to watch.
Jack if you do this again I beg that you include GXAce in your next vis. Pwease🥺
Another person you should add is jazz emu. He makes funny and short songs. 1 minute to 3 minutes usually
@LukaBigPants is very unique, haven't seen anything in this exact style before and personally, i think its pretty cool and well done
If you do one of these again I think you should start the iceberge upside down so the lesser known channels that can benefit more from the exposure get seen by the largest amount of people possible
Jack this is EXTREMELY important ask RSK where he got his name
Only good channels are the ones with 3 videos that tell a story and the fourth final vid was never made. Also it has to be ten years since the account was active
Thanks for adding almost Friday TV. I'm not a part of it but they are incredibly underrated
YOOOOO TONYZARET LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bobby Fingers is awesome. So is North Of The Border.  And this other guy, named TheDirtyRancher, i hear he's fantastic.....
Ive been telling everyone who'll listen about Bobby Fingers for months. Warms my heart to see him get a mention.
SHOUTOUT TO THE FRIDAY BEER BOYS
Always love seeing a value select shout out
4:46 god, shes evil
Captain Disillusion is so underrated despite having over 2M subs,he deserves way more Also, I didn't know you have such refined taste in youtubers (like Tony Zaret)
Wizards with guns is so good. Brown lightsaber had me rolling (on the floor laughing)
you should've brought up jack pop.
WIZARDS WITH GUNSSSSSS RAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH IVE BEEN A FAN OF THERES SINCE 8K they are SO FUNNY
Thank you so much for reminding me of the existence of value select
This is fucking awesome. I'd love a little series of these.
Wizards with guns are the best! They remind me of whitestkidsyouknow but shot above 244p
oh also the ranton video on the playlist has the slur r*tard in! not judging anyone at all, but i thought i'd mention it in case there's a different video of his that you like that doesn't use slurs that you wanted to switch it to :) (i'm probably going to regret leaving this as a youtube comment 😅🤞)
I love lilkirbs
Skycorp Home Video is so amazing.
you just introduced me to like 10 channels I will be watching frequently, so if you want head Jack lmk.
Man Carrying Thing deserves so much more credit for creating the revolutionary Plankton Farts & Dies
scumbag dad 🔥🔥
Would be cool to see some Mukbangers featured
Looooved the vid. Can’t wait for contest results
I hope to make this iceberg one day. this is now my goal
I saw several of scumbagdad's videos but had no idea of his main content because it was just the ones where he shows off goofy watches lmao
below the bottom of the iceberg: jacksfilms
looove the wizards with guns shoutout. they are too god damn funny and are too damn underrated
I'm so glad to see you continuing to fight the good fight and help not only credit the creators, but actually uplift them as well!
Wendigoon??
Not a lot of your viewers will get this but... coldmirror
And yet I’m not even on here, smh
AS SOON AS I SAW RELOXARD I WAS LIKE Thank you. Thank you so very much. You have made my day 2 times better. This guy's editing is remarkable, yet, last time I checked, he had 10k subs.
this video is super awesome!
I'm the best youtuber actually. I'm just so far down the iceberg cause I'm so unknown but also really cool and awesome
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION MENTION!!!
Love Skycorp Home Video. They are so awesome. I didn't even grow up in the 90s and I love daddy Smithers!
Almost Friday TV is owned by Mark Cuban
I'm happy to see alot of underrated YouTubers being mentioned here. This will really help boost their channels.
Cool ad
Yooo I actually am subbed to a lot of these
I feel so cool knowing most of these guys before watching this video
I knew and was subbed to value select before this video I discovered him thru our lord and saviour Jreg, he's a great channel especially The hit me with your car song
Fun Fact Ranton trained in the shaolin temple and knows shaolin kung-fu
Where is HowToBasic on this list?
Lil kirbs!
Speaking of Youtube poops, I highly recommend DaThings to anyone who likes the genre and wants to see it keep going.
Tony zaret mentioned hitting like
Finally Value Select is being dispersed to the general public!…  …yes, all according to plan…
i'd like to shoutout Resprit, the creator of some of my favorite videos - especially "schmovement in video games". we gotta get him to a million.
I can’t explain my excitement that Man Carrying Thing is on this iceberg
the only youtuber i knew here was lilkirbs ._.
Hopefully I can get into the next good YouTuber iceberg been on youtube for 5 years but I’m still alive ahaha 😂
I proud to have know about some if the smaller channels already. Vouch for dimestoreadventures. He's great
Unless deleteme also deletes a certain sniper's videos, I'm worried that it won'g quite do the job. 😢
Almost Friday TV is incredible! And I'm definitely going to check out the other channels
I'll definitely be looking through these. I discovered Ranton, Captain D and NerdCity through one of these videos and they were so good. Jack's recommendations tend to be videos I have to watch on 1x instead of 1.5x because they're so well paced and edited.
dammit jack you made me think Captain D uploaded from that thumbnail, then I clicked and just saw forehead
No Hivemind? SMH
Jack, i think its a true shame that you did not include Folding Ideas into this list. Around 900k subs, so not too big (Like Joel Haver with 2 mill subs, which also deserves a mention), but with videos like "The Line goes up" and "The future is a dead mall", Dan Olsen and his team creates the most relevant and informative essay videos about modern economical treds and fads. Before that they made some of the best videos on the plattform about movies, books and series. This is a must for anyone who wants to consume high quality YouTube.
I can recommend couple more Sl1ppey - not big channel, but editing and voice are on the level, and topics are relevant to rouge-like/lite games, genuinely good person. I found them from their essay on being a content creator, which i highly recommend   Andrew Huang and Rob Scallon - both musicians and have been here on YouTube from almost the beginning, and now experimenting and vibing musically, together, and separately. Mostly i recommend their yearly "series" First Of October, the day when they go to one studio, and record whole 10 track album in 12 hours, the process of making is released on Rob's channel, and stream on Andrew's.
Wait... Is Jack being more effective for YouTube? Trying to keep ya on YouTube for longer by recommending other creators Woah!!
Highly recommend Sickanimation
PSA: Sssniperwolf’s comments are back in latest vid.  But I suspect she went on a massive blocking spree, my own witty comments do not show up publicly.
Appreciate the new content, but unfortunately this is where ive gotta unsub. Nothing personal, just that I don't really like this new direction of your channel. I miss you being funny, and thats not really a thing here anymore. Thanks for the good times, best if luck
Top 10 YouTubers
Is Tony Zaret being “ironic”? I wonder if there’s any way to tell, i’d pay money to find out!
I'm glad siivagunner type content is alive and well on tiktok in accounts like thereiruinedit
Fuck YEAH Wizards with Guns shoutout! I started following them when they had less than 10k and I KNEW they were destined for greatness. They're just too funny to not be noticed!
There is no such thing as a “good YouTuber.” Just ones that haven’t been caught doing something scumbagish yet.
Tony Zaret hell yea
10:07 10 seconds shows nothing
Doesn’t seem right to leave Wendigoon off the YouTube iceberg
I hate when Jack uploads past my bedtime!!! But it's okay if I keep the sound down maybe my mom and dad won't hear me watching this video hehe 😅
Everytime i see a new video from one of your channels i instantly watch it i love the videos
I love Wizard with guns, found them last week.
Dan and Phil games 🔛🔝
Thank you, I will reach a greater audience through this video now <3
I’m already subscribed to half of these people.
I'm very glad seeing wizards with guns on the list
there i ruined it is just kanskaart
unfortunately, we can never know if tony zaret is ironic or not. because of "Poe's Law".
Thank God you mentioned Value Select. It hurts my soul that he isn’t more popular considering the consistent quality of his content
This is interesting, I have never deliberately watched a youtube short or tiktok in my life but apparently I am missing a lot of great videos uploaded only there?
Finally, someone who’s heard of Wizards with Guns
mancarryingthing mentioned. W
Add HivemindTV
I'm always in awe of Bobby fingers videos the amount of effort he puts into his videos is unbelievable and they are huge rollercoaster rides.
Where’s @dingus
THANK YOU JACKSFILMS! I use to watch you with my dad when I was like 9
i think bro has a type
So glad Bobby Fingers is getting some love
I remember seeing wizards with guns when I was doomscrolling tiktok, their post only had like 5 likes so i checked their yt and they had I wanna say under 10k subs. Great channel, great skits.
Glad someone is giving Wizards with Guns attention. Thier videos have given me some of the hardiest laughs on the playform.
I genuinely didn’t expect to be subscribed to anyone at the bottom tier but I too subscribed to casually overcomplicated after he made Morshu read the entire Bible.
tony zaret is an absolute legend thank you for putting him on here
2:34 slipknot my beloved
Not including Ethoslab is almost criminal. That man has singlehandedly inspired so many Youtuber careers.
You put Captain D in the thumbnail and I’m THERE
Man Carrying Thing never fails to carry a thing
THERE'S A YOUTUBER LIKE VALUE SELECT CALLED SOUPY GARBAGE JUICE! THEY DESERVE SO MUCH MORE LOVE
The funniest one which is Marek Larwood and his other channel the Cool Dudes Walking Club, if you are british you my remember him from childrens TV.
So glad to see lil kirbs. Been watching him for a while and he's super underrated
Jack is the man. I vow to personally double the comment count on this video, in the name of original creator exposure 🫡
I have to agree these are some cool channels that I somehow come across
pretty sure the morshu video DID use ai, just not ai voices
Wizards with guns being on here makes me so happy. I know they have a couple hundred thousand subs but they're SO underrated.
Would love to see you do an iceberg covering all the known youtube accounts that don't have any videos on their channel, but comment A LOT on videos.
Where is MIMIR
There must be at least a few more worthwhile channels out there. No more than 4 or 5 though. I imagine there'll be a very, very small percentage of the comments offering suggestions for other videos and channels you absolutely have to check out or your life will simply never be complete. There may have been some sarcasm in the previous sentences.   Thanks to your brilliant initiative (not sarcasm, you started something special) we're discovering mostly smaller creators over on JJJacksfilms. I don't think doing it through a stream would work because it'd never end but is there a way to create playlists in different categories for other channels or videos people may want to promote? I was thinking along the lines of what Nando V Movies did with "One X-cellent Scene". Maybe a unique hashtag phrase that can be put in the video title or playlist that people can upload themselves? I'm just pulling these ideas from nowhere. I'm proud to be part of this community that is getting behind sharing what we love and making Youtube a better place for creators and their fans.
I did a thing better be in here he better be
WIZARDS WITH GUNS  FINALLY
JoeMcShmoeTV Was Here
i really like this video :))) my favourite that you've done in a while!!
i love baumgartner restauration, he’s educational, witty and asmr-like
Wizards with Guns on the list!! Yes!!
What a great subtle non lawsuit-y way to mention she who must not be named in an ad lol. Bless you, Jack
I feel like most of my "old reliable" youtubers have either left the platform, or pivoted to stuff I really don't like, so I really appreciate you taking the time to do a curated recommendation list cause it's a real service to folks like me who go through a lot of videos on here.
7:40 so, a liberal channel?
Jack, you are a LEGEND for including Man Carrying Thing, There I Ruined It, and Scumbag Dad.
GOOD TO SEE TONY ZARET GETTING HIS DUE
Your forgot Neil cicierega
I can’t believe Mancarryingthing made it into a Jacksfilms video
sad how a lot of these videos go under the radar in favor of obnoxious, bright, and loud videos  been like that for at least 5 years
All hail SkyCorp Home Video
That 100% is Penn from Penn and Teller watching Booby Fingers, you can see his daughter sitting next to him.
You forgot the spaghetti and meatballs
Are you sure
CJ The X is the best youtuber
Finding underrated, quality content is incredibly hard with today's algorithm so thx Jack for giving these people exposure and giving me new peeps to add to my sub box
Sick animation is a goat Marc M is underrated genius  Also fun fact he’s the boss in smiling friends
Love me some lil kirbs
6:07 low attention span videos
We stan Tony Zaret
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOATED YOUTUBER TITLE JACK
where’s npesta?
Bro forgot MatPat’s channels
i know casually overcomplicated
2:47 under 1m subs, but 3m follows
he forgot matt rose
Man, i wanted to see Slappable Jerk on this tier list.
Sick Animation and LilKirbs in the same compilation video?  I’m in heaven
Glad to there i ruined it on here, their oktoberfest straight outta compton is a masterpiece
I used to really like There I Ruined it, but they have started to fall into AI covers, which, while funny at times, I cannot willingly support
Possible ideas for the next video: Ivan the unstoppable: the most in-depth powerscaler I've ever seen, with a deep catalogue of  characters he's gone over Jobbers and goons: In the same wheelhouse, but kicks the funny meter on and focuses on shorter stories. Reminds me of a more classic time youtuber, one of the passionate ones you'd find from the mid to late 2010s Livakivi: He's a pretty variety creator. Made a series fixing up a soviet store into a home a year back, made some vids on trying out different computer OSes and mechanical keyboards. If you're interested in any of those things, you'll probably like all of the content. CS Ghost Animations: Sufferer of high quality infrequent uploader syndrome. Has videos on anything, from tech (how to spend 1 thousand dollars on electronics, to csgo) to a video on machining and engineering that managed to  be intruiging,  even as someone who has no idea about either of those things. The zoomers will love him. Technology  connections: maker of quaint tech videos. Low editing, but still fun infodumps.  Edit:  another good one: natural habitat shorts: high quality animal-based skits. High reccomend
This is such a well made video but I think you could've allowed it to be longer and go a bit more deeper into the youtubers
ZARET
Only 4 thousand subscribers lwft
As a representative of the Versus Editing community, there’s a reason we’re not on this list anywhere
having MrMobile in this is a great addition. my favorite personality in the tech world, and he's grown so much since leaving Pocketnow
Make this a series!
Hard to call scumbag dad a YouTuber when he just uploads tiltoks
You forgot a channel called jacksfilms
I’m missing RedLetterMedia! I found them after you mentioned them as yout favourite youtubers! You should mention them too so more people find them!🥰
can't believe you didn't put me on there. okay but seriously you have some great taste man, love this channel as always
Tony zaret is the goat you are so real for this
Value select!!
If deleteme could only delete sssniperwolfs youtube channel
Given the sheer number of YouRubers and niches that are around, I'm genuinely curious what criteria Jack used to create this list.
You didn't include @Azalea22
So happy to have made the list Jack! Humbled to be on the platform
Grateful you included the goat Tony Zaret
YO TONY ZAREEEEEEY
holy shit tony zaret mentioned, ive been following him on instagram for the past 8 years. thats my goat!!!!!
Why isnt nerd city on there
great vid jack
Hey Jack! If you plan to make more of these and shining light on quality underground channels, I suggest trying to represent some brown and black creators too.
not many women hey
bad youtuber iceberg
Wizards with Guns is the best channel
what a G unit for including Ranton :DDDD
I know these comments are probably going to be filled with requests for channels to look at, but i would be remis if i didnt mention my favorite smaller youtuber. Leon Massey is a video essay channel with 100k subs thay makes possibly the most verbose and well edited conent on the platform. The improvements he makes on his style every video is honestly astounding and i cant recomend him enough.
Only 40k more subs! You better keep your promise Jack
Man carrying thing, internet comment etiquette, doctor skipper, lumpy touch, and there I ruined it definitely deserve the spotlight
i got jebaited by the captain disillusion thumbnail, i thought he posted lol
7:30 Yeah, that's Penn Jillette and his daughter Moxie CrimeFighter (who just showed up on Fool Us) to his left.
If you ever do a part 2, you should totally add worthikids
Seeing Tony Zaret and Wizards with Guns on this iceberg makes me so happy, so I'd like to extend YOU a recommendation. If you like Value Select, you'll probably also like Jazz Emu! He does basically the same kind of highly-edited comedy music but a far more funky/jazzy (as the name implies) tilt- and has even started doing comedy skits as of recently. JE and VS have even collaborated a couple times, and JE was the opening act for VS's fairly recent tour!
Sick Animation are EXTREMELY underrated
i like how i knew most of these
God ive been watching tony zaret on Instagram for years
you probably can't say anything but PLEASE tell us you're gonna take the freak inspired the use of DeleteMe to court
you're a gem! not only are you an amazing creator yourself but you uplift others in your own way :-)
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION
Value select is my favourite youtuber of all time, by far the best youtuber i know of
I hate being *that guy*, but if you're after recommendations then I would personally suggest: J. Draper - massively informative videos about the history of London, Jay Foreman does more or less the same as well as videos about maps and music, and Garn. is just a really funny channel especially in the case of their "Every x Ever...' series
Wait, this is just Jack showing us the channels he's subscribed to Book reviews but youtubers
I only need Red Letter Media in my life
VALUE SELECT REPRESENT
There I Ruined It's channel just went into hiberation too lol
Captain Disillusion, Lilkirbs, Man Carrying Thing, Skycorp Home Video, and Wizards with Guns! I actually knew (and already loved) a bunch of these!😄
Not Jackfilms with the personal privacy sponsor after *the incident* 😭
dantdm is also such a good youtuber he's my favorite he's literally everyone's childhood he's changed a lot but still has good content he's a dad of 2 sons now and respects their privacy i love dantdm
I love the idea of DeleteMe but I hate that it’s for profit. That shit should be free. For profit privacy protection is fucked. How about everyone is guaranteed the right to privacy and if someone steals your info without your permission (long TOS does not count) the governments will protect you. What the heck is taxes for if not these kinds of things? Oh I forgot, they’re for more fucking human murdering machines (in the case of Americans.) I will follow several of these channels though. Thanks for informing me of them.
I would also highly suggest CrackerMilk if anyone likes dark humor comedy shorts
Here at 30,821 views.
Very cool.
Value Select is so good! They also introduced me to MACKandgold and damn she's just a great artist.  If anyone wants to give Value Select a look, You Left Us is one of my favorites from them, just downright hilarious. 🤣
Hey Michael fisher getting some love on being in the top is awesome to see! Also congrats to all of the YouTubers on here
man, i love today's sponsor "Delete Me". I've been praying for it before i even know that company exists.
Jack's Films
seeing jack love Ranton so much made me thing that he would put Max0r on the list, if he ever watches him he might fall in love with him
if i may recommend one I've only recently heard of, DJ Cummerbund with 323K Subs. he makes mashups of songs you never knew you wanted until you've heard it
Jack being a Tony Zaret fan really just brightens your day
Also shout-out Westside Tyler, the only live streamer I bother to tune into live, he's got like 2.5k subs or something rn
im happy i can say i watch a few of the shallow waters youtubers
Me being very confused that Jacksfilm knows the german shouty shaolin monk (apprentice) boi called Ranton... I thought he was our little shouty boi.  That said he's a good german shouty shaolin monk (apprentice) boi.
Lilkirbs is honestly my 3rd favorite youtuber
It makes me so happy seeing tony zaret in this, his stuff is so fucking funny! Liberals owned
just beautiful. The YouTube "meta" just feels like it's "find an idea that works and milk it as long as possible", which gets so boring. YouTubers who do their own thing and actually spend time being original are so good.  I'll also just leave one more, @PinoPrime has been my absolute favorite YouTuber recently. He's an artist and game developer and whatever he does, he makes it high-effort and funny as hell :)
Bobby Fingers: the most original channel on YouTube. Only has four videos, and they're all pure gold.
Why no Oneyplays
Almost Friday shout out 🕺🏼
WIZARDS WITH GUNS!! Absolute lads
Value Select is great. Recommend Jazz Emu as well.
I know that it's impossible to cover all the creators who deserve love, and also that this community probably couldn't handle the humor of the guy, but SsethTzeentach deserves millions more people watching his stuff
Erik barely made it into the 1M+ what a crime
Hey let's go, Jack is how I discovered Ranton, I'll never forget that, what a king 👑
Nah Geography now should be one the list. Maybe I’m biased, but what he’s doing is AMAZING.
rip LikeAFoxStudios
WE LOVE TONY ZARET
You forgot dunkey
Thank you for actually trying to help this stupid site which only promotes mind numbing children content that capitalizes on impressionability. Making this a series would be awesome and absolutely promote creative channels
I'm so glad more people are Finding Tony Zaret I have been fallowing him since 2020 such a grate comedian
Danget. I thought this was a new captain disillusion video. Guess I’ll watch it all the way through.
Fuck YouTube. I want "There I Ruined it" back!
Man Carrying Thing got a shoutout here, the absolute legend! He never misses!
wow am i that out of touch with youtube, i didn't know any of these.
VALUE SELECT LETS GOOOO
More of this stuff please
Why can't I save this video? Why YouTube?
i was hoping you would mention wizards with guns
Where SuperMega 😢
Let me download this video so i can binge watch all the channels one by one
Whoa you mentioned the man carrying the thing! He never misses, the absolute legend!
So Jack is gonna be broke after this 10 second video marathon is over huh
No chris and jack? Or jack and dean?
My channel is under the Abyss lol
where’s my channel
I'm literally starving for good content, I've subscribed to like 7 new channels now, thanks! You are now officially the angel of youtube (until Jenna comes back), keep highlighting the efforts of those that need it!
erm excuse me i belivee you forgot lewkeee
Great video, specifically at 4:30 when you can hear my heart breaking
wizards with guns!
youre wrong about a handfull of them
Wow! That ManCarryingThing guy seems like a really nice person who would absolutely not push someone by the name of Joshua down the Grand Canyon regardless of what a woman named Deborah did or said!
If you like well researched, objective videos, that still feel kinda personal. I recommend Mika's rhetoric, she almost have 40 000 subs. She Deserves 4 millions
recently became obsessed with Internet Comment Ettiquette and I can't stop saying "AAAAAAAAND....POST!" oh god I'm even doing it right no–
Wait pepanga nooooooo
Great video, I need more like this now that the algorithm can't suggest me anything interesting anymore!
Harry Gold should be on this list.
chewinator is top tier
Can forget McSussy Productions
Oh no JacksJohnsJamesReels didn't add my favorite high-profile tuber to the top, they must be _evil._ I'll go unsub from them right now, thank you good sir.  *unsubs from Jacksfilms  ...wait
LILKIRBS
Literally only knew about man carrying thing and skycorp. Speaking of comedy channels, doormonster is pretty good but very insconsistent in uploading, like casuually explained or Sam O' Nella
Captain D is the literal poster child for this videos theme.
almost friday tv is great. love seeing cross promotion, i hope youre doing well after... the incident
Lemme add a YouTuber that's not in this list :  Vargskelethor Joel.
havent watched the vid yet but if a youtuber icebreg doesnt have *the* iceberg boy, wendigoon on it, i will be slightly miffed
Rip to there I ruined it :(
MAN CARRYING THING
oh my god mancarryingfilms is now gonna carry many more things
I love Tony zaret!!
Just happy you're mentioning Value Select, I remember you shouting him out in a YGS or something a few years back
It wouldn't be a jacksfilms channel highlight vid without Erik lol
SIGNAL BOOST FOR SCUMBAG DAD HELL YEAH BROTHER
where is Dunkey
I love how man just got up like it was nothing and still continues to put out great content. W jacksfilms  Too bad the simp bot 3000s are now gonna be everywhere on this channel 🗿
Lil Kirbs is probably not the best Mario Maker player, but he's definitely up there. Glad to see him get a shoutout here, though sad to see other channels i'd love to see get more attention not mentioned. Just the fact you are making a video like this alone though, and for the purpose of showing off OTHER peoples work for THEIR good is an amazing thing, hope to see more creators do their own version of this.
Thank you Jack I love you
I'd love to see other YouTubers talk about their favorite channels. It's like how musician's musicians or director's directors are usually lesser-known but masters of their respective crafts.
Leo Vader is the depths but my gosh is he good, highly recommend his channel.
Where is SSSniperwolf?
John, as a fellow horror like-r but can't stand the jumpscares, I have to recommend Horror Mine! I refuse to elaborate any further. Enjoy!
Foot or Skipper mentioned 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION IN THUMBNAIL? Say no more I’m clicking
Honestly, what a Chad move. To go from your usual normal content and then the whole drama thing to this. This is some real actual good content and I'm all here for it
Thank you bro 🍆
Someone that I'd want added to the Iceberg is Ahoy. Back in the day he made guides on the guns from Call of Duty but now makes feature length videos about video game history and the like!
I love when I find channels that just fit me perfectly. Ashens' comedy tat reviews were basically the reason I created my original YouTube account back in 2007. Have found another couple of basically perfect ones over the years - Aging Wheel/Under Dunn which are comedy car reviews and woodworking channels both by the same guy, and Ordinary Sausage, where a man beyond the edge of reason creates eldritch abominations in sausage-form.
damn, i never thought i'd get a shoutout in a jacksfilms video. thanks man
forgot a few imo:  Huggbees: Not only a master of parody, but also makes entertaining history lessons.   NothinButLag: The editor for Supermega, he makes great IRL content. Highly recommend his streams  Jacksfilms: This guys kinda stinky though, i'd never watch one of his vids. (Get it because)
im subbed to 3 of these guys. There, I Ruined It, docter pelican (i forgot his name) and JacksFilms
I think Kirbs is only like the 4th or 5th best Mario Maker player.  His videos are super good though, and funny.  I’m always trying to figure out what he will put on his wall.
I wanna do it just for the nastu comment smh save me
Mr mobile is one of the few youtubers I'll be excited when he posts about an old piece of tech i never heard of or one i barely remember
I love the end of the month because all of my favorite youtubers push out a video on the last day that their sponsors will let them
"As we know something scary happened during October"  💀💀💀💀
bro tony zaret is hilarious, i used to watch his videos all the time in high school lmao
R.I.P To There I Ruined It’s channel
WHERE IS THE DUNK????!!!!!!!!!
That’s insane, thanks for the kind words jack. I’m 21 and have been watching you since I was a kid and it’s crazy that you even know I exist at all. But that aside, I’ve found so many under rated and talented people through this video so thank you for giving them exposure.
WIZARDS WITH GUNS MENTIONED
I've been watching Wizards With Guns for a while and I always love seeing them pop up in videos like this. Thanks for making this to highlight them and others, Jack.
cant wait untill he finds SsethTzeentach
If you're watching this in the year 2023 and I think you are
man carrying thing and skycorp are genuinely some of my favorite youtubers, glad they got some recognition.
3:41 the man, he never misses
Hey, I know that guy
Hope this video ages well later down the line, with how social media has been lately
I’m subscribing to a bunch of these people thank you for showing us them
hi
513
Bruh I love Man Carrying Thing. He's gonna blow up for sure.
where am i :(
I found comment etiquette because of you several years ago, and its so damn good. Im excited to maybe find one or 2 more channels that I love as much. Thanks
I loved this. I’ve been wanting some new channels now to watch
man carry thing recognition
Looked at a few but didn't end up subscribing to anyone. This is a pretty shitty list imo...
Time to study what Jack finds funny
youtube shoutout is back i missed this era
Bro, he said the thing!
I’m disappointed that Crackermilk didn’t make this list. They make some of the best skits on YouTube, and you know they’re good, because their content keeps getting freebooted on TikTok and Reddit.
I have so much more YouTube to watch now thanks to Jack. Who needs cable?
Recently found wizard with guns, funniest stuff I've seen in a while, easily watched a quarter of their catalog before realizing they barely had over 250k subs and almost couldn't believe it.
So happy to see value select here. Love his videos
Meanwhile sssniperwolf is deleting / shadowing all her critical comments on the latest video. Its like the 30 comments are paid for
Let's all just hope he learned his lesson the repercissions of harrassing a bigger YouTube😅r.
The only channels i know are scumbag dad tony zaret and man carrying things lol
Thanks for including me Jack! :')  I'm over theeeeere, in The Basement, just right below The Floor xD
i miss captain disillusion
AFtv is genuinely up with the best sketch channels
Al Gore invented the internet. Its why AlGorithm is the name
Million dollar idea time.  DddeleteMe.  It's like your sponsor, but is dedicated solely for removing Ssstolen videos from YouTube compilations.
Whoa! What a fun surprise! Thanks so much, Jack. Will certainly be checking out your other recommendations!
Right off the bat I see that sweet Wizards with Guns logo!
allthingsbirdie isnt funny or anything, but they make make good informative videos on birds that i enjoy immensley. They are under 30k subs im pretty sure
Jack, this is such a good idea! Your mission to champion creators rules.
You should do art one's
I appreciate you shouting out all types of channels and would love to see different demographics of creators!
What about dank pods?
I watch some of these YouTubers and whenever I see their view count and I just can't believe it, a lot of them are so underrated
Hey its scumbag dad Ooh and there i ruined it Omg and value select
This video and JJJacksfilms have made you my 3RD FAVORITE YOUTUBER, Conargulatons! You should feel honored.   If this video gets a part 2, I recommend shouting out Scott the Woz, imo the most varied and funniest gaming essayist on YouTube, his show is TV worthy, oh wait, because it is on TV too. He even has his own official Monopoly and Clue!  But, who undoubtedly will forever take the cake is Huggbees, creating consistently hilarious trips through all variety of things in perfect depth, the time Texas people kept smashing trains into one another. The goose that wore the most drippy kicks of all time. And Snowflame, The Cocaine Powered Super Villain. Yes, that's right, Snowflame, The Cocaine Powered Super Villain.  I could name like 30 more if someone asks me to, this series could change YouTube forever, man
I’d love if you went a bit deeper. I wouldn’t mind if it ends up being 40 mins long
love captain disillusion!
So happy you mentioned Value Select. Hugely funny, very relatable and absolutely killing the shorts game right now. Deserves to be a household name
YES!!! WIZARDS WITH GUNS!!! I love their videos so much they’re so good!
include i go by lots of names on the 10 hour version
the rise of nox
you missed TPD TV, one of my favourite channels!
Skycorp is great indeed
I am loving this new era of Jack.
I know skycorp and man carrying thing
where chuggaaconroy
I wish I was in this. 😕
Nooooo, I don't believe you. I'm an avid watcher of alot of these. They can't have that small a sub count. (I don't really read sub counts anymore)
The 10 second short challenge sounds fun lol.   I'm in.
Skycorp let's fucking go
Shout out to lumpy.
seeing a small youtuber on this list who ive followed for a while makes me feel like i deserve a trophy, lets go tony zaret!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i watch man carrying thing he is good creator :)
I don’t know what I want more: $100 bucks or Jacks utter disappointment in me
The man that is carrying object is on here? Did not expect.
The youtube algorithm is beginning to recommend a lot of small creators to me, I blame the new jjjacksfilms content but I actually love it
I see  playthrpighs and will say that if i dropped everything on YouTube, would at least be seeing Pete Complete
Love the Wizards with guns appreciation.
I love long duration videos like Leanwolfs and JacobGellers content, but I HATE iceburg videos even of stuff I'm interested in. It's just a bad, clickbaity format.
I since yesterday I’ve been back to the iceberg craziness and I feel called out by this
I absolutely loved this video,. I am looking forward to more like this! can't wait to check these creators out!
skycorp and wizard with guns need more
How to win the 100 dollars:  Put a picture of baby shoes for sale
gonna add my two cents in even though i probably shouldnt; Iceberg Tech is a really nice channel about older tech that isn't ancient, but is feasable enough to play modern games on, a niche rarely explored on the internet
Man carrying thing mentioned
This is really cool. I love how Jack is actually involved in the platform and even knows the deep cut channels. Most youtubers seem to be fans of channels before they get big, but then stop watching anyone at all and are only aware of channels they are friends with or trend on twitter.
It's worth noting that John Green called Eric from comment etiquette the best writer on youtube
Yess @ the Bobby Fingers recommendation. One of the most insane (affectionate) youtube channels i have EVER had the pleasure of coming across. I forced all of my friends to watch his Jeff Bezos video
I am forever surprised and devastated that Value Select aren't absolutely huge!
Doktor Skipper getting the glazing he rightfully deserves, guy's a legend!
AZALI is a channel that I think needs to be on this list. It started a year ago when they just started posting videos of songs they made, but the community has grown. Every song is really interesting and usually has a story. The community is amazing. There was also a meme where someone commented "why was i born" and AZALI replied with "to like comment and subscribe", which I've seen in several meme compilations now lol. They've been growing a lot, so they have 100k subs right now, but they deserve millions.
Unbelievable!! Thanks so much man!
I am looking forward to ManCarryingThing's 48 second long disorientating reaction video.
way to go!
Fucking SCREAMED when I saw Tony on the iceberg omfg thank you Jack you are a fucking SAINT for speaking his gospel
Jack calls YouTubers without 300k subs "the depths" of the iceberg  Me being proud of having 400 subscribers: 🥲
so you only watched like 3 man carry thing videos, cause the effort he puts in his book reviews is simply breathtaking
Yup looks like either Jack got punked into not going after sniper, sued by her to stop, or sued her and got paid but had to stop going after her.  It's sad he won't tell us which one though.  I'm going to go with the first until he says otherwise
ADD FAXJAM TO THIS LIST! THEY DESERVE WAY MORE CREDIT FOR THEIR AMAZING ANIMATIONS AND COMEDY!!
This video is amazing! More like this would be greatly appreciated. The youtube algorithm seems to be hiding smaller interesting channels more and more, even the ones I'm subscribed to.
I'd like to nominate @InternetUnderground for the next video.
I love undertime slopper
Dr skipper❤
Shout out to Scott's Thoughts as well. If you're into Pokemon speedruns that try to be as scientific as possible within the old games, this channel has everything. Statistical analysis of playthroughs and thurough methodology, plus a very calm and relaxed vibe. Just a good dude.
can't wait for Tony Zaret to mention this video in his next upload
Really liking this new version of jacksfilms. Wholesome while keeping the essence of the channel
Why isnt Sseth or Robbaz in this list?
4:08 Dammit Peter
Check out Jack Stauber
LIL KIRBS MENTIONED
okay but          aimkid
I feel like Jack would really enjoy Tom Cardy.
please do more of these!!
Yes. Bobby. Get in on that.
Nah, Ryu is the best mario player...
What the YouTube trending page wishes it was.
IDK if there are any PKA fans here but....RSK means something else to me. lol
a guy who carries objects is goated with the sauce, greatest to ever do it. I can't imagine finishing a day without at least watching one of his vids
Disliked, theres no tally hall                 Ok this is too mich
Why so many shorts creators 😫 YouTube is the worst platform for scrollable content
I love that this is the direction that this channel has always leaned, and that it’s just embracing it even harder now ❤
The harry gold show is a channel with around 75k subs and I love his videos, I think he should be on the next list please.
20% Jack off. I mean 20% off Jack
I thought mrbeast would be at the top of the iceberg, but it seems like he is too obscure to be included 😢
what a cool video i bet the arrows in the thumbnail took very little time or struggle
Your ass bout to be in depth from all the laughing
Fun fact: Jack Stauber also does the SHV VHS thing for most of his music videos!
Leaving out Steve1989MREinfo from the top of this iceberg is a tragedy.
hey jack if you make a new one, i think Max0r is a good addition. he isnt that known but he makes really funny and EXTREMELY energetic videos about him playing through videogames while sort of describing what he is doing in the weirdest way possible
no jacknjellify 0/10 /j
We don't deserve Tony Zaret man
Hi Jack, I tried to use your link to sign up for Deleteme but it's only for US customers :( The code JACK20 doesn't work on the Australian version, is there a way I can ensure you're credited?
doing gods work!
What an amazing video to bring groups of fans together!!!
I see wizards with guns on here?!?! Ok im hooked
I subbed to everyone of these people.
damn, dubstep solves everything cameo at 3:12
This was great!
2:31 Help him!!!
Did not expect wizards with guns. I forgot their profile picture so I didn’t notice it on the thumbnail.
I really liked this video! I got to see a lot of new youtubers I might be interested in that I probably never would've heard of otherwise! I hope you make another one of these (or even the 10 hour one Justin Y suggested)!
My god, when I found Bobby Fingers I was so sad when I realized he only had two videos at the time. I subscribed so fast.
Wooooooo, saw sky home videos icon and I instantly agree!
Legendary, except for the fact that videogamedunkey is the best mario player of all time
Jack, you're taking every opportunity you can to uplift Creators, big and small, and I absolutely love it! Icebergs are usually associated with awful things and people but this? This was really nice and I'll certainly take a look at these Creators. Also, here are some folks to add if you do this again: Joe Caine. His Speedrunning Shorts series is hilarious and an algorithm saver. He's great for exposing engagement bait and debunking nonsense. Another great Mario Maker Creator is PangeaPanga. He's made some excellent yet evil levels in both Mario Makers and he's been uploading daily in a series trying to get to 42069 levels played (noice!) for at least 5 years. FunkyFrogBait and Film Cooper are Titans in the New Wave of Commentary YouTubers. FutureCanoe is the most realistic and hilarious FoodTuber on the platform and he just hit his first million. SWOOP makes the best documentaries on the Platform and she is a Champion when it comes for advocating to for victims of the people she covers while going into detail about things to watch out for when interacting with people online and IRL. Last but not least if you want ethical True Crime content that always puts the victims first, please go check out Coffeehouse Crime and Boze vs. The World/Boze but Shorter. Adrian approaches every case with a level of compassion that's unmatched and Boze is not only hilarious, she is as good as a therapist when it comes to explaining things like narcissism and sociopathy.
Not sure I agree with everyone here some of them are terrible people
gun wityh wizaerd
mate rsk now has 10k subs how tf
I wasnt expecting a random man carrying thing appearance that guy is the goat
@boydilly is a great YouTube channel that no one has seen
Lets go Ranton shoutout
When is the next JJJacksfilms video?
erik could have any number of subs and be in this vid, you know jack's just simping.  he has every right to, im just saying  its obvious
i am sorry wy does the backgroun look like a greenscreen
among us
Happy to see skipper and almost friday in here
Commenting a comment so more people can see this
You must be 18 or older to participate in the 10 second challenge... I am suddenly 42 years old
CD in the thumbnail is a big win!
true gamers watched him edit this live
i fucking love mrmobile, a well-deserved shoutout right there
didn't know he watched doktor skipper lmao
As an Almost Friday podcast listen and lover. Thank you Jack for including them. they are truly so hilarious
Finally some love for Tony Zaret. Every time I'm watching, I'm so perplexed by the fact that he gets so few views.
Shoutout to I FInished a VIdeo Game, Max Durrat, and CIvvie11. All three make amazing video game content that shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys that kind of stuff. Once you start watching their stuff, you won't want to stop.
yo throw me up on there imma be at the verryyy bottom
4:08 Peter from Smosh
Kinda wanna see somebody eat 1 million dollars worth of gold now ngl.
if i want to watch shorts i go to tiktok
the fact that rsk is over 10k now
O
rantoni baloney
glad someone who's actually tolerable enough to watch is giving Tony Zaret some exposure
Man carrying youtube comedy
These are some of my favorite creators :D Thank you jack
oh boy
Wait? where is sniperwolf? I hear shes like one of the best lol
man carrying things is truly the new monoculture
So spooky
Most of those links 404'd. Nice work Jack.
>good youtubers >shorts
I love captain D!!!! lets go!!!!
I clicked on multiple links and none seem to work. I'm on mobile but not the app.
Omg i already follow Wizards with Guns! Yahoo!
Skycorp Home Video is probably the best yt channel ever
I think Max Fosh Should have been in here
where would i be on the list? 😅🤔 anyways good video as always jacksfilms!!! 😁😁
Scumbagdad Supremacy
Vsauce
Can't believe you didn't mention Joel Haver
Based on what you are into Jack I'd highly recommend Nick Lutsko, his videos usually get a few thousand views but they are some of the best musical sketches on here.
AlmostFriday, ManCarryingThing, and LikeAFoxStudios are some elite up and coming content
Missing scott the woz and somecallmejohnny but other-wise perfect
So nice of you to include your boyfriend Erik in the list ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/hibkYz6moLA?si=YiNFEG1j0waGKGtO
the links in the description arent working for me
God I love Man Carrying thing. SO funny, and clever, and his previous book reviews are also so good. If you watch anyone here, go watch him.
Captain disillusion is amazing been following him for years.
JC Foster Takes it to the moon is a super underrated YouTube channel. You may know him for "I walk to burger king, then I walk back home from burger king" but he has a plethora of short, witty comedy videos. Plus, his engagement with his fanbase is admirable.
How on earth did bro make the bible outta that 💀
Hey Jack I tried to check the channels through the links you provided in description but they keep forwaring me to non-existing pages. Can you check if those links are alright for you?
Great job Jack.  Although, that "downfall of pixar' guy ain't good lol
Need some sloppy toppy with a twist
Nice. Now I can watch some youtubers with talent.😊
So glad he didn’t include that terrible YouTuber “jacksfilms”
Wow
The channel links in the description aren't working for me. They go to a 404 page.
Ranton is the man, but so is jacksfilms!
I'm happy to see i'm already an avid fan and subscriber of like 80% of these choices, and I'm even happier that now i have some new youtubers to check out as well
Editing stream gang rise up
we've steeped so low that jack is making an iceberg video.    We did it reddit!
Where's Super Eyepatch Wolf?! Please more people watch them
""Tony"" "Zaret" more like Tony epic BACON!
had fun at the watchparty! here is the promised view.
Why do i only know two of all the youtubers you mentionned ? (Lilkirbs & Man carrying things)
yo I fucking love Wizards with Guns!
Those links don't seem to be working though? Or is it just me.
Great example of turning a horrible negative experience into a positive one!
Disliked, didn't even feature literally every good YouTube channel
Maybe it’s just me but the links don’t work on mobile.
It's so cool to see some of my favorite smaller channels get shoutouts from Jack, keep up the good work!
channel links dont seem to work, but im really glad youre giving people like tony zaret and wizard with guns (among the other channels) this much mainstream acknowledgement
*There are YouTube channels right now that have less than 1000 subscribers But will get over 1 million in 2024*
Man carrying thing is the best one
Jack I hope you know you’re still on my list of great YouTubers. You make me want to be a better creator every day, maybe someday I’ll have something I want to submit to one of your streams!
Anyone else getting a 404 on the links?
actually competent and awesome youtubers on MY shit filled social media? NUH UH
I've been following tony zaret since like 2016, he's only gotten better, it's crazy how he's always able to adapt perfectly to the cultural moment while still clearly maintaining the same style of comedy.
some of this stuff looks like stuff id love, imma check it out. thanks jack, love the video !!
This iceberg isn’t big enough. I hope this iceberg grows.
Hey just so you know the links in the description are broken.
You missed Jacob Geller and Leo Vader and Joel Haver and more
YO IT'S RANTON MY MARTIAL ARTS MAN!
uhm links in the description are broken :| 404! or is it just me?
links broken????
Toddintheshadows???
I might also mention DaThings as another fine ytper
Captain Disillusion is such an underrated channel
Why aren't I in this? I feel robbed. :(
Where the FUCK is drew gooden/danny gonzelas/kurtcoker
i am so glad that lots of my favs are here
Just got click-baited into thinking was a Captain D video…
I did not expect Rantoni Pepperoni to be here
Anyone who likes animation check out AniMatt, he makes really sick fights like Omni Man vs S class from OPM. Very cool stuff and his animation is pretty wild
Orulati ftee chrimsas songs!
it is impossible to tell if this iceberg is satire due to "poe's law"
How did Redlettermedia not make this list?!?
you sold these channels so well that not even the broken links in the video description can stop me from searching them out
im also a good youtuber jack
this list needed someone like emplemon
Just a heads up the links to the other channels are working (well at least the first two)
So happy man carrying thing got on here.
loving this jacksflims character ark, but wanted to mention, links are going to 404 for me, dunno if that's me or the links, pls check 🙏
The Tony Zaret inclusion makes up for Hbomb exclusion
erm what the poop where is SiIvaGunner
There are no other good youtubers. This is it.
Seen Jack edit this video last night on stream! Really good video and Im a HUGE fan of Captain D, Top Tier Quality Content!!
Love the wizards with guns shout out! Underated
I really appreciate how you use your platform to better the youtube community. Good on you.
Jack I know this is a joke but I'm desperately hoping you make another one of these YouTuber icebergs but actually make it 10 hours long and go over YouTubers only the most terminally online people would know
Thanks I’ll sub to the three of these that I’m not subbed to!!!!
the zaret verse is expanding
There's 404 Errors on all the channel links in the description using the full URL, great video though
WOW, what a great video! Jack, yet again, proving why he’s the goat. And yeah, why isn’t Captain Disillusioned huge by now? He’s brilliant and makes informative and super slick content.
3:51 this is the video mct made after jack got doxxed
Great, now I have so many rabbit holes of YouTube/etc. content I can dive into. Seriously, this may result into a timesuck of material I'm happy to watch.
Where’s my man Ceave Gaming/Perspective?
I think you left some guys out, just a few though, obviously not easily over 100  (jk great iceberg)
I love value select! I think a similar creator, Jazz Emu makes very similar content to him and a few of his shorts have gotten a good amount of traction
Value select is the most underrated
Ur perspectives are spot on and I agree with your opinions tbh. Love ur content.
Value Select is very quotable to me
The only actual ice berb video I've ever watched
Your links are broken
If you like There I Ruined It, you'll love William Maranci Mashups
I love carrying men carrying things
went straight from watching a man carrying thing video to here :) great taste
Thanks for letting me know which youtubers are good
Wow thoose were pretty good Youtubers
Daniel Green might get triggered if he finds out Man Carrying Things was included on the Iceberg but he wasn't.  😂😂
So glad value select made it!
Youtube killed, "There I ruined it". Bunch of fake copy right strikes.
Where the fuck is dunkey Jack?
Ooh
4:35 thats what they all say
gssllahs
ALl your links are 404 jack  Edit: the links to the channels are the playlist link works
great video Jack, but you forgot one VERY important channel: SHUTUPDENNIS
100% all of them are good Youtubers, what an epic iceberg tier list you made Jack
I’m so excited for the inevitable skit that Man Carrying Thing will make due to the fact he’s been mentioned in one of Jack’s videos
Good as in morally, ethically, or contentually.
Damnit Jack, I thougt Captain Disillusion had uploaded again!
Erik 💜
bro how are ppl commenting about the vid it just came out 💀
Well lumpy touch is on this iceberg how long till he comments
Am I a good YouTuber?
Long time follower, btw! Will absolutely follow all these people,  they definitely deserve more subs!!!
Somehow jacksfilms could be in any part of the YouTube Iceberg and I wouldn't question it at all.
Didn't expect lilkirbs to be on here!
This is a really cool idea. I've actually seen a lot of these Youtubers, so it's cool to see you mention them.
so THIS is what he was working on??
Why isn’t his channel at the top?
I always wonder how Tony Zaret isn't more well known than he is.
the way how i already recognised 4 within just 10 seconds makes me really happy
*MR MOBILE!!!* 🎉🎉🎉 I’ve taken his advice for like the last 8 phones I’ve gotten. Love seeing you appreciate him!
It’s great that we can finally acknowledge the genius behind plankton farts and dies
You can literally make an iceberg on anything these days 😭  Can’t wait for “The Grass Iceberg” to drop by JimboLips.
Captain Disillusion is awesome.
Captain D!
10:00 hey thats me hehe
My mom told me I couldn't watch you without parental permission DX
its so realistic jack isnt on here!!!!
The links are broken
Oh hey. The guy who makes those diaramas of embarrising moments
Dude really forgot my channel 😔
but it's not as good as how jimbolips was, Jimbolips, (pretty big channel over a million subs) is a channel who suddenly disappeared.
Only a few minutes in and really enjoying this :) Just a heads up, a lot of the channel links in the description don't work. Either way so nice to see you doing this for the community, love u Jack <3
Excellent points as per usual Jack!  I just started my second channel and have been uploading the most chaotic insane content I possibly can to it.  You are a superstar
Love to see the Doktor Skipper recognition!
Oooo boy I got so many new channels to watch let’s goooo
