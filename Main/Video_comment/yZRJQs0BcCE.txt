80 Litres of Hall a week ! Blimey.
Very awesome setup you work hard you deserve to have the best bc you are the Beast!💪🏼🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Wow Chat GPT said your worth £28 million! I never would of thought the Worlds Strongest man 🌎 would be so rich! 👍 😮
Outstanding spa & gym area.
Absolutely brilliant
High pH water is absolutely stupid. Think about it. Your body works really hard to keep your bodies pH level at 7.4. So why introduce high alkaline
The ranger looks tiny in the US but looks like a full size in the UK. Also it seems that all the houses have short ceilings
Respect for putting the link in for the water, I'm sick of buying highland spring its costing a bomb every week & forget tap water, ppl get offended when you say you dont drink it out of a tap 😂
Eddie does so many in depth plugs for products, I hope he's s getting them for free, as like a spokes man. I bet that water filtration system is not cheap and he's got 1 in the pool room and 2 more in the house. That must have cost a pretty penny
Best drinking water is scottish
The land is so beautiful. It seems glum you don't have an outdoor pool.
Nice recovery spa! But what shocked me is you were drinking 12 liters of water a day? That is 50 8 oz cups of water a day?? 😳😳Holy crap, I struggle to get in 8 !!! How do you do it?  And wouldn’t you be in the bathroom continuously? I’ve got questions 🤣😂
Name of water filters plz
Glad to see you enjoying life and doing it right mate
can we get attic update also ed
never heard of that type of vitamin
Amazing, amazing home Eddie!  Built for a BEAST!
Anyone else vexed that he had the tap running while commentating? Just turn the tap off while you’re talking. No point in wasting water
Dope Eddie. I like you better than Brian and Hafthor. Much respect mate
Be kind to each other.  Stay safe.  Love to all
Well deserved!
Cant fault that big lad.. looks mustard!
Couldn’t miss the house tour.moving on to part 3 hi to Alex.daughter & max .have a great week.how’s mum & baby bump 👩‍🦳🏋🏼🇬🇧
What is this water bullshit just smells like a scam that eddie buys into. If they were that good they would be the ones treating tap water instead. Just drink that instead unless you are in some undeveloped country
Good for you Eddie, top bloke you deserve it all
Is the water bottle a security blanket?
Eddie is like a normal person who just got rich.. Love it
Bless him... Eddie doesn't know the difference between Centigrade & Fahrenheit.   A cold tub at 45 degrees Centigrade is 113° Fahrenheit.  Todays "Hot Day" is 34°C and 93°F  😀
We’ve just bought the same swim spa and it’s just turned up today! Thing is fuckin huge.
I did recently a research of my tapped water (got the technical analysis of my local water supplier in the internet) and was astonished that the each values it has was ‚better‘ than the tablewater i used to buy. So i’m saving a lot of money now. Furthermore i found out that tapped water has to be analyzed for 100 items but tablewater only for 50 items.
Where does he get all his money? This would have cost £100k
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Awesome video series Eddie.  Massive congrats and props for staying positive and replying to nice comments instead of propping up the trolls.  Got nice taste there too mate.  Love how the sauna is cleanly tucked away too.
Have you watched doctor strange
Eddie why no Steam Room ( also good benefit )
Way to be environmentally conscious about the plastic bottles Eddie! 💪💪💪
There's people out there through no fault of there own who's homeless and got fk all..then ya get ppl like this who rub it in their faces..he's grafted for it and good on him but no need to do this
When you realize the Goverment just thinks what ever let them drink the dirty Water its not that bad for them ^^ holyshit what a type of Assholes realy they could easy spend half a Million in Tax Money to build a top cleaining System im 100% sure about that!
.... " it was super important to get the swimming pool in "
Eddie just looking at you reminds me of the little weakling that got picked on every day.
WTF KINGDOM
Finnish ground water is the best drinking water!!!
Eddie you've earned it you've worked hard well done xx
Kangen water is a scam lmao. Kinda ruins my image of Eddie that he bought into that.
Everything at your Disposal love it love the House and love the drinking water Brilliant ideas.
Amazing area ! Love the way you positioned the TV there to watch while in the sauna. I’ve built a sauna in my garden for recovery, it was a long journey but so worth it. This has given me some ideas for mine 💡 thank you!
Distillers are best for pure H20. You're minerals should come from the sugars in vegetables not from water.
Spot on about Vit D
Who’s gonna let Eddie know that the PH of your water doesn’t matter once it hits your stomach acid
Amazing to see Eddie getting the home he deserves?!!! Stoked for him!!!    Sacrifice got him everything he struggled through it all!!! Fucking legend… working class mechanic legend headset and a will be remembered forever… the most amazing part is our kids kids will learn of him and have so so so so much content to enjoy imagine having some of history’s most amazing figures putting out 3 videos a week seeing part of their growth and yeah again congrats and I’m glad to see Eddie thriving and earning biggggg bucks without the stress of strongman… great to see more and more obsessions inbound been loving the boxing and can’t wait to see Thor dropped 100000000% we’ve all seen the pads work video Eddie is fucking prepped primed and ready to go
What a great host.
Thanks for inviting us  into your home again Eddie, it's effing boss an I'd like to come and stay for a while! Haha. Superb Eddie 👊👍
Get Kiptoe to do a massive mural in there
How the other half live
I watched a program once. And it's prob on YouTube somewhere. A scientist said mineral water is the biggest con known to man. Multi billion business. And tap water was just. Or infact more beneficial the bottled water.
Damn how did I miss this video lol looking dope Eddie m8 that spar is hot asf lol
Who else wants to see Eddie absolutely wreck Jake Paul in the ring
Started from the bottom now we hear 🎶
some red accents for the interior would have made it more beast like
he paid 10k for two of those kangen filters. holy shit man. didnt know strongmen had money like this! good on you eddie!
Is Eddie actually an architect?
reincarnation of king henry 8th!!! great video. Keep it up
Kangen water you'd sell anything you sell out your just talking shit all the time to sell products now you used to be such a strongman and honest now your a terrible lier get your head out of your hole we all miss the old Eddie hall
Boxer?? Your not a fucking boxer ur a strongman who mite have a boxing match that’s it don’t ever speak of your self as a boxer u sound even worse then load an and Jake Paul
Did you say the cold tub at 44 degrees centigrade is freezing cold? What?! Do you mean fahrenheit?
Nice one 👍 how much for the drinking water installation?
Bro his spa house is literally the size of my house
As a finn, hearing that you have to ask for the water to be poured on the stones in a commercial sauna is beyond bizarre. If you don't do the water, all you have is an uncomfortable dry heat! The water is necessary to make it a pleasant experience. If dry saunas are the norm around the world, no wonder people think it's weird.
Jelous
Hate how this guy talks to his wife it’s so gross… “good wifey aren’t ya” type ish. He’s gross. He’s strong. Cool.
I think Eddie will life a long healthy life with all the health and recovery benefiting machine/apparatus. If I'd have the money, I'd do the same. Can't have mental health without physical health and vice versa.
I loved everything about this except for drinking alkaline water. Come on Eddie, your body will make literally anything back to a neutral pH using a mixture of HCl and bile.
Enjoy
Huge respect Eddie!!!!
why not sink the pools underground? it would open the room up more
The Big Eddie!
I feel bad about all the plastic of the bottles that I was wasting.... Sir, do you know how many KILOWATTS you're wasting on that shit? A week is easily worth a year of PLASTIC WATER.
Ive been trying to find out about the best water to drink for years.   Not that easy to find out.  Always the perfectionist. I love it 👌
No tinted windows ???
How Eddie for for the pyramid scheme bruh kangen scam
Amazing house renovation and gym! Well done ♥️
That is so sick 👌
You have my dream house literally
Random that this was in my recommendation but what an absolute top fella. Love the set up, especially tv in the sauna
Thats a awesome setup
Best drinking water in the world is Scottish tap water
Loving this tour. Off to watch part 4 👍
You know you’re the worlds strongest man when you think 44c is cold.
Love the home
Not bad for a mechanic from Stoke. Inspirational.
That water system machine costs $5,000. He said he bought it to save money???
Come the summer you’re gonna wish you had bifolds with all that glass. If you don’t have aircon in there gonna be awful oppressive
Holy shit some house!!  hard work pays off
Eddie v thor, eddie win by points, eddie wins re match, eddie continues in the boxing ranks, becomes a heavyweight, eventually eddie is on Pay per view pro boxing. Go the beast. Your the man eddie. Top man. 🍖🍗👍👊.
I always love to see when hard work pays off. You probably failed a 100 thousand times in order to get this big succes we all see now what a play! good job all the best to you and your family big man!
Bro I remember how u said u had to lift 500kg deadline just to pay the bills, its so lovely to see u and your beautiful  family enjoying  the best of everything's,  cheers Eddie keep inspiring!
If you are not putting the right fluids in you….
How much for the set up please Eddie ?
I have been diagnosed with low vitamin d
Eddie is a smart man that pool house has everything a strong man needs to stay in peak condition especially when you add the gym in the basement to the equation good job Eddie you have come along ways over the years keep working hard.
Six Person Sauna OR...just enough room for Eddie + Brian.
Man could just join an expensive gym, get a huge pool, etc etc fr fraction of the money
How do you swim in a tub?
such a cool house
Oh common eddie? Kangen watter? IT DOES NOTHING!. Literally... NOTHING.
might have more $$ would love to fight him FREE..... when I when $2m
love the house updates keep em coming
He has good taste. Looks great
Perfect
Hello Eddie we are tripping our balls off on magic mushrooms and feel like we can pick you up from the screen. You are so tiny! Thanks for the video see you later tiny man
That´s not a house, that´s a FREAKING CASTLE!
I'm getting myself one of those. Don't try to stop me.
Nice truck
Change your water change your life 👍🏽
You deserve everything you got only few know how hard you really worked to get to where you are today 👍🏼
I look at this and get so much motivation. I most likely will never make it this big but gives me huge inspiration to do better in my life.
Chlorine Dioxide is best for purification of Water.  Research MMS , and Jim humble! It's great for viruses too. The Big Pharma  etc don't want anyone to know of any thing like this! I think you know why $$$$
So funny the ego on these guys must be on roids too
Kaaaaaaaaaaaangen!!!
Jealousy level on a million
It's not like he doesn't work hard for it. Deserves every bit of what he has. Well done, mate.
your water and electricity bill every month probably is more than my property worth!
Amazing setup but I'd hate to see your leccy bill
He should probably read some actual scientific papers related to drinking water pH... The company will of course tell him that it's fantastic, but in reality it's just snake oil...
Hello from Seattle! It is awesome to see you constantly better your life. You are truly inspiring to watch. Thank you and good luck to you and all your endeavors. p.s. I've got 4 kids and we have been drinking alkaline water from a similar system as yours for the past 5 years. We love it!
House is looking Amazing dude....well done. Hard work pays off for you and your family
These guys just don't get it...The rest of us choose a steroid free life and so have no chance to attain anything like this through athletics even though we might have been born with the talent and drive required.  Eddie took a truckload of drugs and now wants to rub it in how rich he is.  I showed a lot promise in the gym when I was younger but knew I could never compete without steroids because all the competitors were taking them and their advantage is too overwhelming.  I see something so ostentatious like this and I can't help feeling resentment that because of numerous drug users like Eddie I never even had a chance to compete without sacrificing my health.  Damn right, this makes me jealous and angry; thumbs down.
Awesome
Looks so dreamy….  🥶🥵🥶😁
WOW
💙☠️💙
Thanks for sharing your cool stuff with us. Aspirational.
Amazing man love the thought and design you put into this keep on doing what you doing great video!
12 L a day sounds harmful
Can you do a video of how much water you drink a day
I have a kangan water filter, its amazing. Do you have the one that fits onto your shower?
High pH water fucks up my stomach .
This is unreal inspiration.  Cheers Eddie giving me a home sauna idea to work towards! Just bought a wood stove for it. Loving the new ranger too she looks like a fit green lane machine
thor thinks he has a chance against this man. what a muppet
Eddie sauna is relax Time no wahes yuotub😀
I've heard a lot of bad stuff about Kangen water Ed, high ph isn't always it's cracked up to be. I love your new sunbed, your old one is still going fine too which i bought off you back at your old house. I will have to look into those vitamin D tubes myself. Look into Preventa water which comes in different levels of Deuterium Depletion. Get the lowest you can afford. You can buy it from a warehouse somewhere down south in the UK, not sure where now. Normal tap water has high Deuterium content and you don't want that, so it's basically been distilled loads of times to remove the Deuterium which is a heavy hydrogen that is bad for us all. Also hydrogen enriched water is good, not the same as deuterium which is heavy hydrogen and comes off power stations etc and is that crap that is pumped into the air and lands in our reservoirs, and also breathing in Hydrogen gas or Browns gas, look at those. Sorry to hear about your arm, not been on here for a while now, was hoping to see the fight but i see it's been postponed. You will get there. Now i know who you are, if you remember i could hardly hear what you were saying when i came to look at your old sunbed, my hearing is still as bad but at least i know who you are now. I'm looking more into oxygen levels now, do you still have that hyperbaric oxygen chamber, that was cool and i would have bought that off you too if i could have afforded it, and had the room for it. Check out flood your body with oxygen by Ed McCabe, but you probably already know all about that with having a hyperbaric chamber. PS if you want to get high PH levels into your water, just add sodium bicarbonate to your water, much cheaper. You can test it with PH strips to see what level it is at, and if you need to add more bicarb.
Seems like that water system is a MLM scheme so they heavily overcharge you.
You have done very well for yourself eddie      pleased for you
God bless him
You look strong mate, should try out strong man. I reckon you'd go far 👍
I would say conservatively it's a bit small. Typically English conservatism.  The building is too small and so is the poo I guess for his training recovery it's fine. Bit living in the Caribbean l woud say it's a bit too small.   But overall very very practical as always very very happy for Eddy. Massive and kick Thor's ass mate
Living the life style Eddie I've been a fan since the beginning and you've come such along way well done champ 💪👌👍
This video is doing more for that water system than the website. Website design looks like one of those pyramid scheme how to make money scam websites lol.
Tanning beds are absolutely horrible for you and cause cancer factually. Almost a half hour a week is bad news. Get that thing out
Eddie getting the good YouTuber cash now
You can tell Eddie has a very Roman inspired lifestyle when it comes to a home
At least he had taste unlike the douchy YouTube clowns.
Wow you did a great job bro much deserved after all your hard work it came out great I do hope your bicep is healing good and your back to boxing training I really can’t wait to see you fight Thor he is getting much better luckily so maybe he ll be able to put up a better fight now
you telling me you swimming in 35°c water😂idiot haha..
You can't get Vitamin D from a Sunbed
All the burglary gangs watching Eddie's home Vids 🤣 what a  big headed bellend 🤣
I saw an old video of you living in a tiny house well done well deserved
gotta stay hydratated man
wow  you damn rich, like really rich
Eddie’s spent all his money before he’s earned it. Jokes aside kudos, very nice setup.
great, now fight thor
Bro Eddie you are so cool 😎
...I'm in a wheelchair but if you let me stay there for free...I'll find a way in the hot tub and probably live in the sauna 😁😁
How do you fit in a Ford ranger?
Eddie is the greatest strong man of this century
Hydration
Did you read any medical journals to see if there is any actual evidence for the special water’s health benefits? Taken for a ride if you ask me.
The dream
I want to see all the renovations!
“Vit-uh-men-D”😂😂
Curious to know why he didn't put the swimming pool underground?
Nice mate! Well earned and well deserved
Anyone who puts their last name initial on their gate comes from nothing and has never experienced wealth and likely has a small weiner. Literally the tackiest thing you could ever do... if my parents saw this they would disown you from the elite circles. I bet he has towels and stuff like this too, soooo tacky...
You're looking good Eddie and you sound more relaxed and calm (arm and bicep healing nicely). It's all about balance. Thanks for sharing.
Who is the sauna supplier? Is there a web please you can share?
checkout zamzam water
That's incredible. Eddie deserves all the best things in life. He's worked so hard to get where he is today and shouldn't be judged by people who don't understand his daily routines and the consequences of not being able to recover properly. Good on yer Eddie. You're a hero of mine and such a gentleman.
you’re wack
There are many impressive things about this man but the most impressive stuff for me will alwaysbe this mans massive calves. Just fucking look at them.
That's great but when are you fighting Thor?
Those are some giant trucks but Eddie makes them look small lol😂
Nice
I though 7ph was the best????
Spent all this money on shit ya don’t need, you’re not even competing, you’re fucking retired, and no you’re not a boxer  You don’t need this room, you’re not doing strong man
Tap water in Scotland is great. In England naw it's no good.
I don't understand One thing. If you are a retired athlete, why all this stuff?
No-one recovers like Eddie!
WE WANNA SEE U TRAIN
Question eddie how do you think you would do against pudzianowski in the ring?
Some pad the beasts got
Eddie’s boxing form is a fucking joke but his home and his taste in design isn’t.  What a stunning home he’s made for himself the whole thing!  The H on the gate is a classy touch.
how does the hot and cold work ? I heard people dying from heart attack when going from hot to cold and that it's dangerous. I heard a guy was working hard in the hot summer then dying on the shower because he set it to max cold. How to go from hot to cold without danger and use that as recovery ?
key's in the pot!
Is this house called Eddie Hall?
The good life enjoy 😉 you deserve it Eddie
He should rather build a new shithouse no normal toilet can contain all the crap that comes out of his mouth
At this point I'm starting to think the boxing match is about more than just the money if I'm basing it off the mansion.
UK winter ‘harsh ‘ ? 🙃 I am a Brit living in northern sweden ..... Uk winter is tropical  compared to -30C winter cold 🥶 . Snow is dam great fun 🏂 ⛷though 👍.
Is the boxing apprentice still on the team...?
Where did you get your sunbed Eddie?
I don't ever wanna see Beasts electrical bill
Live in Scotland water perfect. I guess by the whole of the UK you mean England lol
Looking good Eddie! 😎👌🏻
Would love to see Brian Shaw and Oberst "fix" the H on his entrance gate to read "H2O!"
Utility bills must be through the roof for this gaff 🤣
I wonder how much ue paid for the house
That is my dream …
Beautiful!
That is just gratuitous, no man wants to see you naked. Lol. You lucky Bastard Eddie (Your Hard Work is Not Forgotten -  500kg).
Eddie get yourself a diesel
How much is that Filter ???
Eddie hall is like a comic book character
Say no to bullying and support our Englishman the beast Eddie hall
I really appreciate all the health advice you give with your explanations on the additions to the new house. You truly are an inspiration and a beast, well done Eddie!
Can you do another collab with Ross Edgley in the near future? Your collabs with him are always awesome! Maybe some sort of challenge in your new pool...
You’ll be spending a lot of time there after your Thor fight
12 liters a day wtf haha
Killing it Ed 👍
6 person sauna or a sauna just big enough for Eddie. California tan??? You all are a pasty people, love yah, but pasty.
Jesus hes not even had a boxing match yet
So happy for your success Eddie. Your a great inspiration. And very down to earth. And real. Glad you’ve done really well. It’s well deserved
Hi eddie
Sorry mate! why are you not training? I swear to god from now on I'm gonna be like your mother!  Hey Eddie stop fooling around and go do your homework!
I would like to see a video on how you think your stem cell thing went and if you thought it was worth it upon reflection and now a fair bit of time has passed. I'm gonna be honest, my immediate thoughts on it are it is expensive snake oil, but I've never had it done so I don't have the experience to go off. Interested to hear from someone who has had it done though!
Either a dirt cheap vitamin D pill ORRRR.... a $10,000-$25,000 stand up sunbed...
What I'm not understanding,why not put that pool into the ground and build the whole building surround a bit bigger. Weird 😬
That was the most masculine way I've ever heard someone talking about lavender scents being released into the air.
Bloke deserves everything he gets earned that with literally blood sweat and  tears he brought sttongman to the forefront again like how i remember it as a littleun lovely family good role model tough tough determind bloke all the best to him and his family
Lame content! Why would anyone like this kind of videos? What do people profit from seeing a dumb house with a spa? What are you giving back? You are all about me, me, me, me and me. Congrats you just lost a subscriber.  I hope people would wake dafuck up and do something for themselves instead of wasting countless hours, watching stupid content like the ones that you upload Eddie Hall.
Well done Eddie mate living proof hard work pays off
just said the cold tub is 44 degre C? so hotter then the hot pool?? or was that  a mistake
Why didnt you put the swimming pool and the hot tub in the ground? It would look so much better
When ur making ur own water you know you've made it 😆
Good for you, you deserve it
The sunbed is blatantly for his missus.
Your content is great look forward to your new vids every week. Arnies was great too congrats on a successful weekend, your Q & A was a good laugh too!
When Eddie says the sauna fits 6 people does he mean 6 normal sized people or six Eddie Hall size people 🤔
That is a cool build eddie. You worked hard for everything. Cool you can enjoy.
Great talk at the Arnold Sports Festival on Sunday morning, it was inspiring. I even got to meet Stallone, I’ll never forget that day. Thank you 💪
Eddie Hall, the man who literally lifted his way into living his best life !  and a stokie to boot
It's all cedar wood, it smells gorgeous... Until Eddie uses it once...
You gonna need it after thor slaps ure ass around
Careful with that sunbed, and don't forget to check yourself for cancerous spots.
Big gate for a big boii!! I haven't been hear since you where doing sit-ups in the yard on the missus yoga matt lol missed ya buddy,place looks great too
Where did he get the the cold water therapy tub from?
I want to see Eddie smash out an ultra marathon with Ross after the boxing. Like one of the BIG ones they have in the US.  See him just smashing out all kinds of athletic shit.
Looks like your sauna is missing air vent from the back. Also you bit killed the mood with that hose instead of metal or wooden water vat... Cool sauna nevertheless!
The bully hall
Only a britt would spray the stove with a hose... blasphemy. The sauna gods are not with you Beast...
Your water maker looks alot like the one I have on my yatch, I'm sure yours is much less costly though
Eddie, we gotta hear your steps to your bicep recovery. An average man would  be laid up on pills still!
wow I remember u showing us this spot with the pool in the yard in the tour . that was fast came out great.!.
07:10 Brian Shaw- do you think Eddie will finally be hydrated enough with this new water filtration system?! 😂
Is it safe to drink water with a pH of 9.5?  Something doesn’t seem right about that Kangen. Nice spa setup!
LIVING LIKE A KING! AWESOME
Eddie awesome to hear you care about cutting down plastic use! Let's goooo 💪
Proud of u Eddie lovely bloke u deserve it
Very nice 👌
Looks great Eddie! Success story’s like yours are inspirational to us all. Keep smashing it! 🥊
Do neighbours get access to the spa too 🤔
Eddie run some auxiliary water proof  speakers off your tv into the sauna 👊🏻
Love how you called Larry on his bs. He was like a deer in headlights lmao
Awesome
Awesome 😎
I was here when it was just a slab with a pool. I'd say you've done a hell of a job of not only helping yourself with recovery but added value and just fun factor to your schedule and home. Well done Eddy, very well done...
U deserve it
Im envious... looks fantastic
I have that same machine. Have had it for 4 years. It’s excellent!!
You need to clean your lens.
Does anybody know what kind of sun bed he is using? Is this better than standard beds? I was under the impression standard beds are not healthy. I assume Eddie has some alternative type which is healthy.
He deserves this. The Beast
Eddie really over compensates for his micro nutrient intake
I like this Eddie
Keeping hydrated I see.
I had a swim spa at my mast home. It was great, extra electricity was a bummer but swimming was fantastic and it helped me recover from a knee injury
Eddie we NEED a training+recovery session video with Brian/Gargoyle Head here!
Would love an incite into how much the gas and electricity bills are, the spa is brilliant
*Zombie apocalypse happens* *Nukes ruined the world*   Meanwhile: Eddie is cozy in his vitamine D chamber like no fucks given.
The spa is gorgeous but I can't fathom why you wouldn't have had the pool inlaid into the ground so it's not so high. Also, the water filtration system is amazing but the wiring looks so messy. Definitely should invest in having it built in and more clean/sleek looking.
Are you going to put a picture of Shaw in a Roman art on your wall
Is there any other WSM winner that has accumulated so much from his matches, sponsors, paid appearances ?
A hose in a sauna... fuck me, what a game changer
I respect Eddie. He's got all this money and fame and still chooses to live where he grew up. No where fancy just where he is born and bred
As a Finn, I am not completely disappointed with that sauna.
Looks a bit shit,, used to have this lad nosh me off back in the day!!
Blows my mind that getting high quality water is such a privilege in many Countrys. In Germany you can easily drink the water which comes out in the Kitchen sink because it is so well filtered
Eddie we do murals all the time, we can replicate archways looking over a Spanish vine which I think will look very good there. We are specialist decorators and always work with high class clients and royalty.
Here in Finland every house has a sauna. Even in the slums the apartment buildings have saunas in the basement. I hope that's a REAL sauna, and not some 60C warm room, you can take your wife to a picnic..
The Hall Kingdom ... digging the colors you went with on the exterior !! 💥💥 And of course, a sick spa, imo. 🤜🏼🤛🏼
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  This life isn't all there is, heaven and hell are very real, but Jesus Christ loves you and can save you. If you will ask Jesus Christ with a genuine heart to please forgive all your sins, and come into your heart and please save you, he will save you and you will soon know how real he is. God bless.
Vitamin D is essential but vitamin D bulbs for a sunbed is giving me the same energy as tartan paint and spirit level bubbles 😂
What did you use for the walls? If it's waterproof I also want to use that for my indoor swimmingpool building.
very fancy, it gets cold up there huh. I've lived in australia for 41 years and still haven't seen snow yet
Absolutely loved this, carry on the hard work mate 💪🏼
Never heard of sun beds providing vitamin D? Day light is the no 1 way to gain vitamin D
Eddie the real life Cinderella story from diesel rags to heated pool riches🙌 truly inspirational, Ps. Still hoping you get to slap some humbleness into thor
They keep promoting there useless protein powder but they don't tell u wat really makes them big is steroids
This just in, Larry said thors balls are still in his mouth hahahah
Eddie is a well liked public figure n respected in the strength world he should promote stopping the use of steroids these young people are all using steroids now cus of people like Eddie n Larry wheel
Drug cheat junkie role model no ! He is a cheater all those strong men are that's why mainstream media don't like reporting on strong men comps they need to bann horse hormones in strong men cus that's wats these weirdos are taking why are people not speaking on the use of dangerous drugs in strong men
Why u so insecure with yourself
What's the starting song name plz??
Man child!! And a salty one at that!!  Where was my positivity Larry Wheels....boohoo!!
I hope Jason Statham (The Mechanic) does not appear under the pool and kill Eddie.
12litres a day?? I’d be a constant fountain in the bathroom
His house could easily be a top notch 5-star-hotel...
Eddie your such a cry baby hope Thor drops you classless and so sensitive. Larry wheels apologized and you acted like the bitch that you are.
Eddie hall vs vikkstar swim contest
it was sick seeing you at the sports festival Eddie, shame I couldn't get a picture tho. legend.
Big man with a big house. You livin' now.
You should do more podcasts, they’re always great
I agree with your water choices Eddie, I bought a plumbed in version similar from the then H20 company, after a demonstration at home some 15 years ago around 2006. Basically removing chlorine, iron, copper, zinc & other minerals etc. to produce nothing but pure drinking water... That day we tested bottled Evian... it was 330ppm, tested my own tap water which registered 270ppm so cleaner than Evian, then I was shown H20 cleansed tap water after filtration that produced just 0.8ppm (pure water).... I was sold but it wasnt cheap. This was 15 years ago and cost me close on £1,700 back then.. The company is still going strong but trades under Pureh2o these days..... for anyone wanting decent water store bought you simply cannot beat Voss (produced from Norway)... its pure, expensive but you get what you pay for & its in glass bottles NOT plastic which can leach!!
Luv your sunbed with vitamin D tubes, course I take tablets myself at £12.99 a bottle instead of a 6k walk in  ;)
Some gaff mate! Worked bloody hard certainly deserve what you have got!
Watching you invest in yourself and your family is wicked lad you deserve it all. Hard work pays off! I will be round Tuesday for that dunk and sauna party 🥳 🤣
Imagine having all these technologies just to get knocked the fck out by thor 😂😂😂
Eddie keeps calling himself a boxer in every video is like me lifting a few weights and calling myself Mr. Olympia.
My absolute role model. I felt inspired even being 5 metres away from you when you broke the punch bag at Arnold fest on the Sunday. Keep inspiring mate!
Don’t want to take the fluoride out the water. That’s why peoples teeth aren’t like they were 100 years ago
Absolute top lad. Humble and still hungry. Earned everything he has.
Wow, you are so rounded in your comm, and looking great, how is your 💪 doing. Saw the match with Devon, what did you think ? I think Devon is great but not a boxer. I 100% think you will overpower the Viking as he has  trained a little bit too much  ?  you look trim but still pumped. Thanks for the tour 👍
I can totally agree with this...😎😌  Enjoy your "me time" Eddie!💪🏻😄
we wanna see you being salty as fuck more of that please kiddo
Hey Eddie I'm happy for all you success, but you need to attended a boxing camp. I love all the toys, but you need to put them aside and go old school boxing. If you look at Thai boxers or American boxers, they don't use all theses gadgets at the beginning of there career. I'm sure you can justify why you need them, it just seem that there all a distraction. If i had to give one piece of advice, it's stick to the basics. Good luck Eddie.
Imagine being that obnoxious u get that water machine… just drink normal water like the rest of us 🤯🤣
Eddie why u going on about a fucking photo on Instagram to Larry, who cares, ur meant to be a strong minded man? 🤣🤣🤣
"Designed it myself"  "With an architect"
im höpping another yöör :D big love from germany
Eddie's finally found something that hydrates him 🤣🤣🤣
Don’t think anyone is as committed as Eddie. Who thinks to themselves, this tap water isn’t good enough. Researches and researches and now has his own ph filtration system for his recovery. Doesn’t miss a thing! Love it 💪🏻
Nice 1 - hgv fitter- strongman- millio0naire- and still down to earth. 💪👍
Hopefully that kangaroo water keeps you hydrated
When is the fight date with thor?
Nice one Eddie! The spa looks awesome as does the house! Hope you and the family are enjoying it and best wishes for the future! P.s. knock the f*** out off Thor 🥊🥊👍🏼👍🏼
Eddie, you shouldn't be so sensitive if Larry Wheels hurted your feelings. I knew from the beginning all Larry was doing, was just to hype the big boxing fight with you and Thor. Larry is a good humble human and you should never be angry at him for feeling that he's in favor of Thor.
How much is your electric bill?
You attacked larry did that make you feel better? Attacking someone like that doesn’t make you a smart person? You made your self look like a bully
Science with Eddie
corn flakes have vit d
You was an absolute knob to Larry Wheels. Making out you're a hard man. You're an egotistical gobsh*te. Can wait for Their to iron you out. Good luck keeping you followers.
SPA’s amazing but that F150 style ranger is just awsome top work dirtyunicorn
No steam room
dude that kangen water got rid of my dads high blood pressure! stuff really works
I like Eddie hall but he needs to act as tough as he is I can't believe he got offended At Larry wills grow up man you're a public figure you're going to have to deal with it Toughen up
Eddie hall drives a Ford ranger 😂
Hard work pays off 💪🏻💪🏻✌🏻
You are a very inspirational man Eddy, however this kangen water machine you speak of is complete rubbish, if you watch the promotional video on there website they speak of how acids are bad and alkaline substances are good, this is complete nonsense as we consume various acidic foods in our diet such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, the latter ofw which contains antioxidants that the so called kangen water contains. Furthermore the alkaline water will be immediately neutralized when entering the stomach as it is such an acidic environment leading to no health benefits, you are better off with normal tap water as its free and it contains all the vitamins and minerals you need. Don't fall for this rubbish people!!!
Eddie, the lengths you go to are amazing. But I'm amazed that despite all the research, you were drinking water out of plastic bottles, which has a reputation for lowering T levels. I'd drink tap water over plastic bottled water any day
Damn Eddie..your still dehydrated...drink up..
Eddie. Will you let me power your home with my technology of green energy? We can then call it Beast Power Supply.
Looks amazing man 👍
That water sounds decent but why don't they tidy it up so isn't so ugly?
V nice
Eddie you need to do a audio book my 14 month old just sits and watches with me and he’s so focused on soon as he hears you voice he just runs over and sits next to me
the realisation at 9 minutes in that eddie hall is responsible for most of the microplastic human beings are consuming in the 21st century
Show us the house!
Mad you used to be fixing lorries and doing strong man, now living the dream
Absolutely amazing!
Kangen is just another gimmick. Lmfao.
You have a beautiful home Mr Hall
Nice Cars Ed. I hope for you they are electrical 😅
Lemme guess? You live in London?
Can I live here? 😂😂
Eddie buys the worlds best water   Still dehydrated 😂
This just shows all your hard work and determination is all paying off p.s was awesome seeing  you at the arnold expo at the weekend  and breaking the punch machine 👊
I can’t wait to see what kind of art you’ll put in that spa.  Personally I do expect to see a huge canvas of you, still your arm extended, and Thor in midair, halfway his fall, with an empty expression in his eyes.
Hold on a minute you don’t even work!😂
I designed it myself........yea boys put big windows in!!
The sunbed has to be worst idea for a source of vitamin d surely. I love the idea of going extra level for recovery and the water idea etc but the sunbed thing takes the piss surely
Oh wow looks amazing eddie 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
If i win the lottery i'm going to use this house as a reference as i can't fault it in any way.
Well done mate keep it up and kick is ass sooooon
I also am a Kangen distributor so if anyone needs more information I would be more than happy to help!
Pussed out of a fight..... Very manly beast... Keep it up
Well done mate , you've earned this . All the best for you and your family's future .
How sick is his house 👊🏻
You could fill that pool yourself drinking 12 litres of water a day 😂
A hose in a sauna.. Well that's a new thing as a Finnish person to see :D  We just have a bucket of water and a scoop to throw it on the stove.
Without exaggeration between that house, that gym, and that spa why would you ever want to leave this property? All you need is a quality food delivery service and you're set. i would just spend every day rotating between house, gym, spa. Hats off to you.
Looking forward to seeing you toppling that mountain 💪
Optimum hydration goals reached
Self made success blood sweat and tears years of hard work just shows you can achieve your dreams if your willing to commit to your goals
It's kinda weird also, how he's bought all this stuff and does literally everything he can to be as healthy as he can, yet he literally does 3 minutes a day in a cancer causing machine. It's been studied so so so many times that tanning beds cause cancer, and at 21 minutes a week that's literally insane. Makes me second guess literally everything else he says. Unless of course the bulbs have UV shades, but then he mentioned the tan so clearly not, just doesn't make sense to me.
All this shit you do realise you’re going to look like a right dick head if you get knocked out first round 😂
Eddie's swimming pool  powered by tears. Dry your eyes 😂 poor larry was shocked at how sensitive he is. Cool spa right enough
🤣🤣🤣🤣 the winters being quite harsh in the UK 🤣🤣🤣 That's cute 🥰  Go hang out with Mihail in Siberia😜
Thor lives in Iceland and he has no roof over his hot/cold. "dont want to get cold during my hod/cold" XD Thor is so much stronger human bean
I can not think of a better business name than “dirty unicorn”
Thor gonna hand you your face
Him talking about vit d levels. Mine are below half of the recommend amount. Might have something to do with works nights for 5 years
Eddie The Cry Baby Hall
5:16 for 6p or 2 Eddie
All this water still not fully hydrated
Anyone who try’s selling you a subbed on Vitamin D does not have your best interest at heart.  There is no such thing as a safe subbed, anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.  There is definitely enough sunshine in the UK…I grew up in the 80s whereby parents thought that the sun does your kid good…was also an athlete in the 90s.  In my 40s now and, despite being a shade seeker, I still ended up with Melanoma.  As you say Ed, do your research…sun beds are not a recovery tool in the slightest!  Stay safe, you dunnie want what I got weighing on your mind
Nice things.  Hall you are a successful man, one of the strongest athletes in the world, you have worked in clubs as a bouncer and you know how "out of the ordinary" things work I have no doubts, but ... precisely for this reason I was amazed by your reaction with Larry Whells , I found it exaggerated, Larry does not seem to me a man sure of himself despite his muscle mass and strength, indeed he seems to me really the opposite but he is a good one, even shy.  Maybe he rang the bell for Thor too loud but you scolded him heavily and even in a vulgar way, you have to grow a lot from this point of view, then you will also be a great man, best wishes!
Wow I think I want to be a strong man, Jesus look at all the money this guy must have
That looks full of shit. Better leave the pool outside and the sauna extra👎🏿.🇩🇪Das sieht doch voll Scheiße aus lieber den Pool draußen lassen und die Sauna extra
Eddie passed the torch down and make me your Prodigy
you should train with Anthony Joshua
“Puts the PH off the charts” Normal drinking water is around 7/7.5 so it’s barely putting the Ph up that much. It also can not help you digest food properly with that level of PH
Looks awesome 🙌🏽👏🏽 hope you knock Thor clean out 👊🏽🥊
My family got a Kangen machine years ago and we love it! Best water I've ever had!
Eddie taking hydration to the next level, always.
Love the song in the starting of the video ❤
He is the real Viking
Hell yeah long live the Beast!!!!💪👑
Nice, promoting sun beds to your audience. Really sensible Eddie, hope you realise the % chance of getting skin cancer from sun-beds from as little as 30 minutes per week are huge.
Why are u acting like a cry baby, in Larry wheels last video?
You should explain what happened with you and Larry
Tap water in the uk… hold up Scotland has some of the best water in the world, England is where it goes downhill
Big cry baby…
Your brand has exploded 🖤
Eddie getting his water right so he doesn’t get dehydrated before fighting Thor.
Beg the dehumidifier isn't on with the windows open.
eddie u be best getting those front metal gates sorted as the gaps in the bars thor would be able to slip in lol
I want to know how much he spends on cranberry juice lol
Your microbiome tends to be healthier when you ingest some more acidic foods like sauerkraut and apple cider vinegar and becomes unhealthy when lowering the pH through medication such as PPIs or ant acids. So I doubt it would be healthier making your water so alkaline.
Damn I'm proud of you Eddie. You climbed to the top of the mountain and earned every single trophy on the way up there. Now you just need to beat the mountain and ascend into godhood!
Just needs a nail bar in there and you're sorted
Fantastic place for all ur needs well done Mr hall I,d love the funds to do it! Get fight fit do what we know u can!
Used to like watching your videos, but after watching what you were like with Larry wheels don't think I will watch again. Think Thor is right you are coming across as a bit of a bully pal. You might be big and strong but there's a lot out there who are harder than you are just remember that
I just want you to know I watched the clip of you confronting Larry.....Kudos to you brother.....I’ve always been a fan of you, the way you carry yourself a lot of people can take notes.....you always seem like a genuine good guy. I’m definitely pulling for you against Thor, most of all hope you’re healing well.
You can't get vitamin D from sunbeds
I love how obsessed with being healthy you are ,I’m glad to see I wouldn’t be the only one investing all my money on hood health ❤️
Flexin with that gate
6 person sauna, roughly 2 eddie hall sized.
*I’m pretty sure you want your water around 7.5ph because you need balance with your stomach acids.* This should ensure optimal digestion, mineral absorption and also ensuring that the good stomach bacteria and acids aren’t neutralised.
Fit for a king my man, I wish I could have something like that but I've never been the world's best at anything, much respect to you. You worked beyond hard and it's paid off for you 🙂
Kangen water, hahah sounds like the people from school trynna sell me into a pryamid scheme
"Hard work pays off." " Discipline equals freedom".  take your pick...
Sweet!  Super nice!
Eddie has the eternal look a man that needs a good wash
btw if you use really low pressure with the kangen machine you can get a higher PH than it advertises, the one i've tried has max limit of 9 but i've gotten 10 PH out of it
The link for dirty unicorn isn’t there
Special vitamin D bulbs 😂😂😂
I feel like you could sell Eddie anything as soon as you put "Hydration" in the sales pitch or title :D
The spas aren’t built in? 😂 bruh
Thank you so much for watching.! Hope you enjoyed  the little THOR of my new spa.
Love your videos it looks amazing
The beast is the running coward now we all new he llwasnt gonna turn up
But the real question is when do we get an HotTub stream?
This is the exact definition of the american dream, coming out of a big gate, with a huge house, cars and even a spa inside. Crazy how you live.
The house is a gaff
I’d love to film a montage or a video for you brother, if you allow me please reach out. I’d do it promo for you.
That is sick love it
Size of his calves, beast!!
fantastic eddie love it well done wish u even  more success
I saw you in your truck going southbound on the M6 just north of J18 the other day. The things massive. Respect for the way you were shifting lane hoggers out of lane 4 😂
Looks fantastic 👌
That Kangen website do be looking like it has a great investment plan for all my crypto - all I need to do is transfer all my funds to a shady account.
Gotta admit it's a very well done green screen of a bloody Disney  Haunted House behind Eddie Hall.  On a serious note, it's a mansion indeed but he has earned every damn brick and nail on the property.  The gate could move a tad faster.
Man go prepare for match and loose weight
When's the rap album coming out?
Must be nice
For a man like Eddie Hall who's always dehydrated, he sure relies on water for everything else. The pool, the hot tub, the sauna, etc. Lol
Eddie do a updated day in the life.
"yeUR"
As an eddie fan i hope he wins the fight because this guy deserves everything
So when can I come over for a glass of water like I'd love one 🤣
Idol🙌🤩
That bet must’ve weighed half a ton. Love the setup!
Awesome thats the result of hard work and success!
like
The water tho! I just drink at the river
Brian may have the best strongman gym, but damn, Eddie for sure has the best recovery setup/spa facilities for any home setup.
Eddie you have so much life left to enjoy, dont cut it short with skin cancer, talking from experience with that hellish machine.
💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Watch larry wheelss video, The fuck Eddie?
All this and Thor is still gonna bash you up 😆 🤣
we love you, but please stop with all the acid/alkaline water BS...your stomach acid neutralizes all of it!!
Witman :D
For youtube videos to watch in the sauna, I have to recommend the channel: The Modern Martial Artist. The guy does excellent fight and technique breakdowns.
This is amazing but please don't promote sunbed use. It's huge for cancer and very dangerous
Princess 👯
After knockout by thor eddie will be thrashed by larry hahahahah
Think u meant 44 f not 44 c ed
Eddie they also sell Vitamin D supplement pills that’ll cost you 100x less
Amazing what YouTube can do for you if you put effort into it...good job Eddie (and team)Bye bye cold winters bye bye hot summers 👍🏽
Awesome man I’ve been looking forward to this one! Great stuff, here’s to top recoveries and to ripping Thor’s head off 😂👊
What happened Eddie? The fame going to your head or something? 🤷‍♂️
Looks like a carage with full of light, and other stuff 😁
Hmmmm what to buy.  $15 bottle of vitamin D tablets or $x,xxx.00 - $xx,xxx.00 machine.   I wish i had that dilemma lol.
Hey Eddy,, I k ow you are training hard for your math against Thor, but with your retirement from strongman compilations, what is your plans moving forward? Are you planing on training other athletes moving forward, or are you planing on boxing more long term?
Fat bro larry is right
Larry is right
Eddie's gonna be spending plenty of time recovering in his spa - once Thor has finished battering him senseless in that boxing ring!!
That sauna looks dangerous. Just waiting on someone to lightly touch that hot piece of metal and get burns.
Top top man 👊🏾
Finally! Saw the shed all finished when you told us about your tear and I've been waiting since to see it
I've been supporting you now for a while been backing you up when people slander you online then I see how you confronted Larry wheels was quite disrespectful and that last comment to Larry where you said keep sucking Thor's dick, Larry took it as a joke but you ment it, don't turn into a tool like thor or other utubers please and respect the people who try help promote you.
PH- level is going out of  what and where?.?.  Would not drink that water if it`s below 0 or above 14.
Everytime I watch Eddie's vlog..I feel refreshing 😌... absolutely flawless life...
That water machine is great, had one for 5 years now, never go back to tap water again.
Eddie talking about water and fluid intake daren’t say the ‘h’ word 😆
Another Eddie-mercial
I would hate to see your Electric Bill.
Hey Eddie!!😝, if i was in HallLand and was able to see you sooooo damn raging mad......I might blame it on Thor's jaw. -not it
Look at me and all the expensive things i have. LOL.
vittman Dee
What state he live in east coast also steam room over sauna
You've become a disgrace and disappointment to the sport. You yourself showed several bad things about Thor in your vids but couldn't stand when Larry showed one little thing. Went straight out to him like that. You were the one talking to balls to him when you didn't have any to face Thor.
Losing respect for Eddie little by little. Started off being a huge supporter but the childish antics are getting old, the latest case with Larry is just the final nail in the coffin. Either just knock thor out or stfu.
the house is really coming along nice👌
Mad to think that Eddie drank 12 litres a day but was still chronically dehydrated 😂😂😂
I heard you filled the pool with Thor’s tears
The Beast💪🏽💪🏽
Would love to see Eddie’s POWER 💥 BILL
2
World's Strongest Man's new WORLD'S STRONGEST HOUSE😄😄
Def jealous
Used to be a fan eddie, but now ive been seeing a different side of you. Larry was just hyping up a fight and you are taking things a bit too personally. Thor beat you at deadlift and Ill be unsubscribing now
Amazing I love watching Channel . All the best in the future .
Larry - 10 grand conversation Eddie - watch my 100 grand spa
Thanks for the water info
Writing notes down, this man has everything you can and don't think of. He won't lose against Thor but if he does which is a slight chance that's going to be upsetting with all the pre cautions he's had in place. Only thing he can have more is a better coach like world renown.
Y'all have the cutest little trucks in the UK!
hydration is no joke! sick setup bro
I feel like you're dedication is misunderstood and very well maintained
Are u using the spa when Larry is butthurting you..?
Seeing what you have now; I hope you watch Muhammad Ali's last fight at least once.
Fifteenf best in strempf pound for pound. Eddie pronunciation. Amazing how the property is looking.
Has everything still salty from comments that mean nothing
Wow! Now I really want to buy one of those water purification systems. I contacted them and they quoted me ~$5200 Canadian for a lower tier option. Still waiting to be quoted on this model
Eddie loves that vitamin D😂😂
It's shit as compared to Usain Bolt's house.
Roll on Eddie Vs Thor the so  called mountain doesn't know whats coming! Eddie's like a staffy gonna mully fuck out of him, if ya know ya know
"good luck with the bicep"....larry.
Finally Eddie is hydrated
Mean while,   Thor is swimming in the North Sea...
Robert Baratheon when he was young???
No wonder Eddie was always Dehydrated, he's been drinkin tap water
Whats the rules for the Thor fight?   Are you bothering getting tested for PED's ?  Or is it the same as WSM?
Eddie your recovery center is awesome 😎!!! Has everything
Me: *Waiting for Thor to release a video of his HotTub which is of course capable of 41 Degrees*
Eddie hall the next property king 😂
This guy spend more money on recovery and still blows out a bicep? Thor didnt blow out a bicep
Imagine the amount of gobar gas this man can convert.
A yur
His body isn’t 75% water, it’s 75% cranberry juice.
Nice One and Great additions, you can never go wrong with Water !!  Water has soo many benefits for us, both internally and externally, especially since we're made-up of about 60% water !!  Personally though, I would've sunk the Pool into the floor so I coould walk down into it instead of having to climb into it.....Each to their own though, it's cool whichever way you have it !!  Happy for you mate.....Keep Up the Great Work !!
Four person sauna if Brian Shaw visiting 😀
Can we have a before and after Tour of what has been done already?
Don't drink high ph water when you eat. The high ph neutralizes your stomach acid so the food you eat has to sit in your stomach waiting for new stomach acid to be produced in order for digestion to progress. I don't know if it's harmful but it definitely decreases the efficiency of the digestive process.
Why you bully my Larry ...I'll fight you on his behalf
Which vitamin bundles or multivitamins would you recommend for a male? Don't want to buy any cheap crap.
Awesome pad Eddie.....living the good life 👏🏻👏🏻
I remember when you didn't have that building around the pool. Looks great!
Great video!
Hey Eddie just a question, why did you feel the need to call out Larry ?
Also - amazing stuff Eddie, your house is wow-factor!
Eddie has all these new fancy water fixtures but there’s no doubt he’s still dehydrated
Suggest purchasing a hand held phone gimbal for your videos @Eddie - will make huge difference to these really cool videos :-) - love your videos, keep 'em coming!
Kangen is a pyramid scheme sadly
from watching your documentary on netflix to see where you are now .... well done and you deserve all you have achieved .... big up the beast
When you were talking to Larry wheels about the time he offended you and he was giving you an apology. While he was apologizing to you you kept offending him by talking about him eating bull balls.   It looks like you can dish it but cannot take it.
Officially lost a chunk of support with how you acted towards Larry Wheels. Tried to embarrass him for supporting Thor and when he handled himself properly and apologized to you, you still had to throw another insult at the end. THAT was embarrassing
If you want top, elite water with error proof quality, buy Vitalis water. It is an internationally awarded Portuguese water and is also available in a glass bottle.
You are pathetic
Can't beat good old Scottish Water
Always got time for you Eddie
Fucking nice place. It looks that's the batman house!
U rlly hated on Larry u child🤦🏽‍♂️
There's no real evidence that alkaline water is any better for you than regular tap water.
hows the bicep
Eddie let me know if you want your windows cleaned for your home And gym!
You earned and deserve everything you have Eddie, and all the universe has for you. A true legend 🏅🏆🏋
He just needs a big picture of Brian Shaw in the spa 👌
He lifted his way to this. What a dude. I look up to him, hes strong and healthy hes got a family and he’s wealthy.
In the Army we had guys like you. Al the gear and no idea. Keep ya hands up for the 50th time 😂
Super fun to see! 😊
I remember when his house was the size of his pool house . . . . Some motivation right there
Didn't show his money tree he had planted🙄🤔🤔
If he has been able to afford  this lifestyle, big respect for his intelligence in business. Strongman is no exactly the easiest sport to make money, even if you're  one of the best, and  with a short career.
👍💪🔥
What’s his power bill?
Nice one man.
Need a window cleaner Eddie??
Seen the ranger at gravity show a couple of weeks back and what a car you have Eddie perfect car for a strong man
You drink 12 litres of water a day. Wow.
Not jealous at all pal 😭😭
Mate fuk off with your constant look at how much money I have bull
The compound is coming on nicely but are you properly hydrated 😆
Good to see you are doing good in life.
Eddie you're the man, straight talk no bullshit, I love when you straightened up Larry Wheels about him broadcasting your decapitated head, he shat himself mate but you asked him again , he had to apologize , he's been in Thor's side and said to Thor " knock his head off" . Eddie you need to give Thor a beating he's asking for, please mate dnt slack off just shut him up once and for all please 🙏🏽
EDDIES A BIG SOOK AND LARRY HURT YOUR FEELINGS YOU SOOK CRY BABY EDDIE HALL
Idk what research you did for the water but sounds like you got scammed. Water hydrates your cells, idk how it how oxygenates your blood since only your lung does that. And "molecular rich water" yeah no shit water is just made up of molecules called H20. Sounds like a laods of bollocks mate .
Nearly as big as your ego Eddie
Beautiful spa! Building codes are obviously way different in the UK than the US. That and we both just do things differently. In America someone like you would've built a spa like that twice that size with high ceilings and all the same equipment 😄 Looks great tho. Nice to have a spa in your backyard!
You should definitely have Brian Shaw over to your new house and vice versa love when you guys do a video together.
The world's luxurious strongest man
God bless you always
Eddie wanna buy me a 125 ?
👍🏻💯
👏👏👏💪💪💪
Eddie is a silly close to Thor
do you think he means it when he says 'big love the best'.. I live Eddie but not in that way. I mean in the kind of way i'd like to smell his farts and tell him how hydrated he looks
smart man great investment now just need solar roof for free electricity which is  to high in UK
Cheers, Eddie. I’m a long time follower. Behind you all the way. Always appreciate the tips.
Eddie will be needing that spa for when Thor knocks him spark out
Hey you said you will be getting that 10 grand from Larry... HAHAHA good luck getting that from Larry!!
Oooo Larry you hurt my feelings please apologise 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Swimming in 38 degree water? Fuck me
Alkaline water is a scam
Why do I hear a distant screeching sound of a doctor
Enjoy it Eddie worked really hard for what you got.
Dudes chanced I’m surprised most of y’all still fuck with this dude
nice to see a brit making big bucks
Eddie hall will beat the shit out of the mountain
thors jealous
Eddie Hall bought a new hall.
I can't even afford to decorate my bathroom in my two bedroom council flat that was last decorated in 1995 but i Must feed and buy clothes for myself my wife and children first 🤬
He'll need that dedicated spa after he gets his arse kicked 😅
"the winters are quite harsh in the uk" LMAO you need to get out more eddie
Knowing Eddie the new intro will be him burning into Thor’s back big love the beast 😂😂😂😂💪🏽
Eddie I watched the video of you and Larry wheels and I'm a huge fan of yours you need to lose your insecurities it came out strong when you confronted Larry, Larry is a good man and most likely promoting the fight to bring up hype but maybe not it's his opinion, I believe you will knock Thor the hell out way too much power way too much strength. Believe in yourself Larry is a good man there was no need for that and he was the bigger man and apologized which nowadays is remarkable.
I remember watching your Netflix documentary, it’s when I got into watching strongman stuff. You have come such a long way and you deserve everything you have congratulations. As a new father all I want to do is provide as much as I can for my family.
Eddie u just lost a follower can’t believe how u handled that business with Larry .speaks volumes to what kind of person u really are and from hear u look like a weak minded man child .you have 0 class .
But where is the positivity for me in all of this!!!???
You should give me your black Ford ranger my dream car lol,  but seriously the way you talk about recover is quite impressive mate and keep up the good work.
Eddie get INKVERSION to do your mural. Man's a beast with an airbrush
you have to win against Thor , PLEASE ..
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No its Larry’s legs hanging out of Thor’s rear end
A pound a litre for drinking water? Chat shit.
With that new rig hopefully Eddie will be able to stay hydrated
Beast doesn't start with "H" that gate needs changing Pronto! 😆
This is like watching mtv cribs beast style 💪💪
Sad you had to act like that with Larry. No need mate.
I Love how you setup the home training & recovery facilities. Proper decent 💪💪💪💪💪
Got a new one for ya Eddie. How about Eddie ''Princess'' Hall. Big outside, sensitive and insecure inside.
hydration station
Looks great
Dreams bro with the spa. That is an awesome room. Congrats
Insane Eddie! Definitely deserve all the fruits of your hard work mate. Live it up for you and your beautiful family. Much love from Aus
12 liters of water wtf
Love it 💚
44°C is freezing, my levels are above optimum and that's a good thing, and I use a sun bed instead of taking a dietary supplement.  Some have brains, some have brawn I guess.
When are you going to box Thor?
Dream🔥
“I’ve had the vertical tanning bed installed to ensure optimum levels of vitamin D”  Bollocks, the missus definitely made you add that in on the planning blueprint.
I’m glad he’s enjoying the Boxing, but I wish he’d continue Lifting.
I'm glad you're getting the rewards you deserve. All those years of work and dedication is finally paying off. Congratulations. If you need a cabin built in Montana I'm your man. *finger gun, tongue click*
Very nice to have!
Whens the amusement park coming? 😂 😂 I can easy see a Arcade hall coming soon.
Dissapointed those iron ball decorations at the start of your entrance stairs aren't dumbells :(
I bet the water taste better aswell
I like that bathroom in there man yeah I poop in that toilet and heartbeat the shower is nice too matter fact I'd probably poop in the shower and stomp it down the drain it's real nice I hope one day I can have something nice like that and the front of the house is beautiful kind of wish I wasn't so lazy and actually worked hard and applied myself
Eddie take the piss out of Thor call him whatever you want, little cartoon video at start of older videos of you and Thor  But then you cry to Larry and accept his apology only to ‘kick him on the dick’ right after. Your a hypocrite that can’t take people not choosing you   Come on buddy
Gotta take those covers off the pool and hot tub, now that you’ve got a roof
Eddie, message from Finland where we have a sauna in every house. Use beer over the stones in the sauna. Just a little drop mixed with some water. You can thank me later 💪👍
ah, the polynesian spa
House goals!
Hall Hall? Nice.
Amazing..the house is looking awesome and we appreciate the insight 👍
Hi Eddie, as a pro strongman and world record holder, can you maybe do a video on Joint pain such as rotator cuff tears, healing them, nutrients that feed them etc... You healed your bicep tendon tear very fast. This will be a good and informative vid for all of us who are trying to be like THE BEAST.  Mad Love.
9.5ph drinking water? Yeah, no.
Hope you’re investing some money too so you don’t end up broke 🤑
🐷🐷👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Daaamn
Eddie finally is able to solve his dehydration problem
eddie it's over, thor will knock you out
Only dude with a bigger gut than Eddie is big Lenny 😂
Who just stopped by from Larry Wheels video? 👀
Eddie "The Crybaby" Hall
That is not a ranger that one is a 150 Raptor. The black one on the right is the Ranger.
You know what's different about you and Thor? I've nothing against the man but you have personality sadly Thor doesn't luck forward to you winning that boxing match with ease 2nd round knockout goodnight vienna
Eddie is getting fat
Thought this was great to watch, love to see all the cool stuff you have for your training. Also seeing your amazing house makes me work harder as that is the kind of life i want too. I remember you when you first came into strongman, to see how well you have done because of all your hard work is amazing and shows if you put your mind to something you can do it, that is why i am always team Eddie.
Water makes it a steam took. A sauna is not supposed to have and steam, dry heat only.
Nice 👌
Awesome job Eddie. The spa is amazing. I love the dirty unicorn 🦄 - brilliant! Hope all this recovery kit works wonders for that bicep. You said you were going to get the other bicep checked to make sure it had no damage. Was it all OK?
Very nice Eddie well done you've earned this buddy👍⭐👏👏
Eddie doesn't live in a house when he owns the royal Albert Hall that's why he called Eddie Hall lol jk
I'm sorry Eddie but that water ionizer, the alkaline water is all bs, there's not enough real proof to support those health benefits claims, whoever recommended you alkaline water is not "trustworthy" because they didn't do the proper research, ask a second, third opinion, talk to nutritionists, Kangen water and the claims around it are bogus.
My Savage Uncle! The Worlds most powerful MAN! The King 👑 of England!
So uh what's the electric bill for this bath house alone?
big baby needs a bottle
I like the setup Eddie, things I have been researching myself for my new home.  I was researching water systems and I have not come across this one.  Thank you for the info!  P.S.  I liked the video that was posted with Larry Wheels..made me chuckle.. I honestly don't think he was hating on you, I believe he was steering the pot.  However good call on the call out haha
The only thing I mite of done different, was to have bifolding doors instead of windows.  👍👍
I don’t even want to imagine his energy bills 😂
How much did it cost for all the building and inside?
I felt bad about how many bottles of water I was using but ok to drive in that ridiculous truck in Stoke...lol
No lack of money there!
My uncle has a property up in the mountains with a spring that has naturally filtered water.  I got the water purity tested.  It was 99.99% pure.  Best water I've ever had!
Eddie just likes to be Wet but not hydrated 😐
Shaun lomas uses the same  thing he swears by it, anyone that goes to his gym he only uses that in his and he swears by it
Eddie i just saw your clip with Larry Wheels.
Eddie got bread lol
Eddie make a video on Larry Williams because i feel like that video didnt sit right with alot of people ,larry was hyping up your fight its a good thing regardless of whatever hurt your feelings he apologized for it ,and obviously u still feel a certain way about it , you and thor both made videos of the torn off head thing  both exchanged words but this needs to be addressed in a calm manner  , of course people can disagree with me but i feel like you and larry need to sit down with eachother and talk to eachother like men , not sitting down a whining  or bringing anger into the conversation but a nice calm conversation where both sides can be heard and get over it
Can help but feel that Eddie doesn't want the fight with Thor.
It looks great, very useful. Always great watching eddie hall vids
So many recovery methods with shit evidence behind them blowing up atm. And £1 a litre of water!
A yeao 😂
Incredible spa.
He is like a candle , he consumes his self to light the way for others.
A man who built his castle  literally from his strength. It's amazing what Eddie has done through sheer hard work and determination
Great job Eddie💪🏻
Now that's what I call wise investment. Awesome work Eddie. Thanks for the update. Looks amazing. Can't wait to see the attic remodel.
Would you think you would be in this position two years ago?! It's crazy how far you've come from the WSM you won.
Where did he get the money from?
Looks the business Eddie, I just watched your chat with Larry wheels (have come off) on nick strength & power. He looked liked he was bricking himself. Good job.
Eddie doesn't even look that big to me tbh .......small wrist and forearms . There is an arm wrestler names levan that has a bigger forearm than Eddie's biceps
Nice, if I had some money I was thinking it would be nice to have a place with some space for an indoor pool for water polo or whatever, although we make it out to play ceiling basketball pretty often.
Kangen water though lol. Biggest MLM scheme.
Jesus......... 100k spa.... in your garden. Legit.
Imagine if Eddie had this place/house/home recovery clinic and home gym. 550kg deadlift maybe 😁🌋
The man does his homework. amazing set up
the perfect home
We wonna see you boxing! I know you don't wonna reveal your progress, but come on! Just a bit of footwork!😁
12 litres of water a day? Doesn't sound healthy to me.  And was still dehydrated?🤣🤯
I like the house vids Eddie I was waiting on you doing another, if I win the lottery I'll buy it off you 😆
TEAM LARRY
Im so jealous
I hate to break it to you, but that water system is scam
bruh
Mighty posh for a fella who refuses to behave politely in first class situations! Can't wait for Best, Oberst, and Shaw to come give that spa a proper commissioning.
So happy for you my man! As Conor McGregor once said, “From nothing to something to everything”
Scottish tap water is where it’s at 👌🏻👌🏻
Well done, very jealous 👏
Vit-men-d got to get it 🤣
His cardio involves his wife yelling for him and him running around his compound trying to find her
It’s amazing that Eddie won wsm without all these luxuries. I wonder what a prime level beast would be like with all this stuff.
All this water and Eddies still not hydrated
Wow you are getting your home well sorted, i hope that you show us the house 🏠 when it's all finished, and i still say you are going to slay hafwit no bother 👍👍💯
Thats a amazing room love it
All this recovery and still tears a bicep
Have to say hot&cold is not necessary, but it feels nice and feeling good is important, regarding an effect on your muscles it is not necessary, evidence is clear, "only because something has an effect it does not justify its use" a massage improves circulation by a 100%, a nice little spin improves circulation by 300%
Awesome!
Totes well jel!
adopt me
Hope one day I can afford half of this stuff
Just seen the video of you with Larry , have to say this boxing thing has really made me see a bad side to you and I’m unsubscribing !  Get a grip Eddie
Love you bro
That house is not yours. Until you fight Hafthor bjornsson. Be prepared for the lawsuits. Because we as public are going to demand that fight.
Wow the front of your house looks so nice now man!
Eddie the baby hall
You gotta get that drinking water right to stay hydrated huh Eddie?
Eddie is now finally hydrated…..
You should have had a crying room built, you big baby
Larry doesn't believe in you. Getting hurt while doing nothing, while Thor becomes a more and more experienced fighter. Connor syndrome. Get desperate, and all the sudden the mask starts to slip, and you start being the asshole you really are.
1080p this time lol………..what a house and all the additional you’ve done really well for yourself nice one mate
40 degrees centigrade is boiling hot and 4 degrees centigrade is freezing cold.  Got it.
If he focused on boxing as much as does all this shit he could be a slightly above average boxer
Congrats Eddie on your second child!
When are you fighting thor tho don't care about the spa
Eddie was you getting offended by Larry's post a joke? If not then your really a joke to the fitness industry. XD
Year ❌ Yurrr ✅
Going right off Eddie just seen the video  of him having a  go at Larry  Eddie  if you can't take it don't give it out your going on like a baby hope thor sorts you out
Hopefully this new spa will help you cope with life
You accepted Larry's apology by walking off calling him a cocksucker!?!?. Larry gets a new sub, and you're losing one. Good luck with the bicep😉....
Eddie is minted.
Internets done you good man, gota prove yourself now..
Well deserved Eddie all the  hard work payed off 👍
Best house in stoke on trent by far!
Eddy, you should remove chlorine and fluoride in all your water, including your shower and pools. Look into it.
No boxing.. your paper view will literally be on paper,no one cares..let your ego go
Well! Mr Hydration took it to the next level i guess😂
You have so much money that you can think you can do anything, you are a fucking YouTube phenom and a one time wsm.. nothing else, you are jake paul in a heavy version
And that dear viewers was the infamous "Hall castle"
The other 4% are bitter ….. good for you Eddie .
Eddie’s anti dehydration building
That house is stunning now
Eddie can show cartoons kicking Thor and humiliating him but can't take it himself, smh. Big bully.
You should've challenge the Thor to a track running Advent you would have won that now you're flexing on YouTube remember where you came from a little apartment mechanic
must be nice being rich
Congrats on everything u’ve achieve,all those years of hard work and sacrifice for u and ur family have paid off.Well done The Beast
Unfollow Eddie everybody if you believe in real sportsmanship
Not just a hulk of muscle, also a GENIUS of recovery!! This is what sets Eddie apart from other athletes.
This man is inspirational because he climbed, swam, and lifted his way to the top constantly breaking down his body till the end and it was worth it because he got a wife, kids, a good reputation, along with a castle as a house.
nice home spa :)
Beautiful! 🤩
This man really knows how to manage his house 👍
THis little shed is built better than my house :(
I would hate to  pay the gas and electricity bills for that 😂 if you can afford the finest things in life why not, I would do the same 👍 ps how's the bicep coming on Eddie??
Eddie i am a huge fan but mate, crying for an apology to Larry ????  you are the worlds strongest man physically but emotionally? just win the fight and prove them wrong.
very good t jari hyvärinen  suomi finland
Ladies and gentleman the biggest crybaby on planet earth  Faking a injury to avoid haftor bjornsen how sad  Larry should not appologise to this sore loser
You need to get Brian Shaw over :)
Eddie, do you keep the cold pool cold all the time/sauna on all the time or do you start it up each day or w/e?
I saw the video where you confronted Larry Wheels involving the photo of you decapitated and I was very pleased as to how you handled it. Harsh, just as it was supposed to be. Not easing the blow at all and going down harsh with your words to get that apology. Honestly, I think I am too much of a nice guy for this kind of stuff but I definitely want to to become more like you in that sense. People can't step on other's toes like that and expect to get away with it. So just thanks man for being a good example of standing up for oneself, I will take this video to heart and try to learn all I can. Big Love, a fan!
Hope to see this man go into business and maintain his presence in strong man along with the wealth. Good shit
That spa setup is elite. Combined with Eddie's basement recovery... eff me.
Eddie, why do you want to get even hotter in the skull than you already are? I mean, you're already at the boiling point, the boiling point that Thor has inflicted on you.
The kangen link is awesome. Thanks for that. They are quite expensive though 👍
Did you say something to Larry that made him turn on you and pick Thor?  THAT's what we all want to know.  Because if you didn't and Larry was being a dick, I understand, but if you did, then it's a bit hypocritical of you to dis Larry like that.  You are constantly being offensive and arrogant and when it comes back to you, you get all offended.  WTF?
You are the Best Strongman I've ever seen ❤️
After seeing u pulling up on Larry I hope Thor knocks the F out
house looks mint proper batman vibes
U little karen
Don't listen to the nonsense about sunbed vitamin d. This is very irresponsible. Yes sunbeds give you a small amount of vitamin d but it's far outweighed by the health risks of the sunbeds. Sunbeds are bad for health. Not good Eddie..be real you want a year round tan
very nice Eddie.  interesting stuff  as always!
Eddie please kick that Hercules gene into high gear and knock thor out and then schedule a fight with Larry wheels 😏😏😏😏
Eddie, with all that equipment and your super-healthy diet you’ll be training 100 years from now to fight Thor’s great-great-grandson!
Ngl seeing you at Arnold Festival was a experience
*every Scotsman in the world*   "ITS NO AS GUD AS OUR TAP WATER!!"
Saw Eddie confront Larry Wheels, and it was good, funny stuff. lol
Very nice indeed! Well done Mr.Beast!
Congrats Proud of your success
It would be nice to have a house like that, the unfortunate thing is that i can't walk naked in the yard.
The spa is bigger the my whole house 🏠 😱😨😀, and that's in his garden, his house must be a lion compared to my ant sized house lol. Beautifully designed BTW ❤ 💖 😍
Eddie talking about water, me on the edge of my seat waiting for him to say hydration.
Why do you cover your pools they are in side???
You need a window cleaner am your man lol
Larry feeling real lucky he dint get slapped 😂
why you being so sensitive eddy
Don't say anything negative. He'll get upset
When is the next house tour? & What would you want in/outside your house, that you can't now get?(e.g garage)
You're gonna burn your leg every time when you go through that sauna door
How is your motorcycle doing???
nice spar edward, but where`s all the customers/shelves 🤔🤔🤔
It was so good to meet you in Birmingham on Friday at Arnolds sports festival.
No one has preventive Care like Eddie!
"Super" good video Eddie loved the "Super" important toilet in the spar and the "Super" light in the spar... im sorry haha your a legend mate
When the house 100% done you need to do new showcase of it👍
yesss my dude you are a legend
You need to learn to take some banter Eddie or you'll lose alot if your fans and by the your version of the Arnold's was awful and I constantly heard people moaning about it and I was there for 3 days.
Eddie, you should consider inviting AJ to train n use your recovery infrastructure.. it's win-win.. I mean come on, I don't know.. (I might be wrong) but I don't think even AJ has such a state-of the-art recovery set-up..
*Six person sauna*  Well, guess that Eddie and Brian won't fit in there then
that looks so great Eddie BUT you need a remote controlled motor on that T.V. so you can turn it from the sauna ;) big love from Denmark ;*
Yo eddie, pre fight banter is tradition in any fighting league, its part of promoting the fight and getting fans engaged and pumped up. If anything your fans seeing that felt more firery and will now support you more. Relax on Larry Brother.
Worlds Strongest Man living like a king!
12 liters of water a day? Sounds really over the top to be honest.
Name me the man who takes things more serious than this guy
It is nice to know you are thinking of the planet with those plastic bottles.....  It has also made me think of what plastic i am throwing away.   Lovely home Eddie ...Wishing you and your team well .  My Money is on you :D
don’t know about that dehumidifier, what if you get dehydrated?
This whole video is a deserved flex
thanks for doing higher than 1080p
Think you should smash Wheels in the chops next Eddie.
Just watched the video of you confronting Larry Wheels. Get over yourself Eddie. I really really used to like you, but you're such a hypocrite. You know the social media game, your intro has various ways of you destroying thor, but as soon as someone does it the other way, you can't take it. Relax your ego, I really want to be a fan of yours but you've made it impossible.
who gives a fuck
Eddie isn't the most important thing  Hydration 🤔 !!! 🙂
I hope you will win the fight against this Icelandick jester
your special water story sounds mostly fine (although i found hydrogen rich water funny but that seems to be an actual thing that might be useful in some situations), but i never thought about water that way but i guess it makes sense that you can make water better for you or something. Although holy shit that site you linked looks like a typical scam website. Also apparently the product is BS anyways (or compared to Dutch and Belgian tap water). you might wanna look into it as i have a feeling the mentioned advantages are either fake or dont have any real effect.  i did find a better looking site from the supposed manufacturer of the device and trhat looked like a proper company site and not some scam. so maybe its useful somewhere but it vertainly looks like its just all nonsense.
RIP Thor
NICE HOUSE EDDIE YOUVE DONE VERY WELL FOR YOURSELF BUDDY KEEP UP THE  GREAT WORK BUDDY BEST WISHES
Lol, injecting yourself with poison while cleaning your drinking water. XD
Been looking forward to this one , all the best Eddie mate!
Dam this dude has some money.
So this is where you will be recovering from your emotional distress from when you have to pay Larry Wheels 10 grand.  Maybe you should just call it off now, considering how easily you get hurt now a days? Then again, it isn't as if a brain injury can make things worse for you. Good luck Edd, because that is all you have going into this fight.
I’m so glad you got in Larry’s face…that was epic! Well done mate!
Hard work pays off, met you in monsters gym before all the success. Well deserved 👍
do not brag about your fortune your glory days are long over you spend money thoughtlessly more than one has done this and ended up on the street
Place looks great Eddie dream home for hard working driven man, also handled that talk with Larry like boss, he was like dear in head lights when out it on him… Big up 💪🏼
Saw the grey ford ranger in stoke the other day while at work didnt see if you was driving it tbh looked mint tho ed
Fantastic to see that you using kangen. Absoltly best thing anyone could buy. I wish i could buy one as would help hugely to my fibromyalga. Also recovery of my broken ankle. great to see you have done amazing research. love your channel. great seeing it finished. love update on your house
Imagine going to all this effort spending all this money and then getting ur arse handed you 🤦‍♂️ eddie i hope you smash thor
Looks really good 👍
Looks great, Eddie! Pricing up a home spa now, thanks for that haha.  If you do ever need help with architecture, I've used "British home design" in the past and they were brilliant, I would highly recommend 🙂
Your behavior with Larry was quite childish on your behalf Edward, hope you stop being egotistical narcissist.
Taking care of that hydration.
lol. just watched this a.hole, try to intimidate larry.
I dont know why I watch your video's, you'd manage to piss me off helping an old lady across a road.
Very well done Eddie.. looks really good. Keep doing what your doin brother. Love.
Welcome to the kingdom of the BEAST
Eddie so did Larry wheels hurt your feelings u big baby ..u like to talk shit to other people but when it's your turn u get butt hurt
what happened to the animations in the beginning of his videos
Dude you ought to blur the plates
Wonder how much he's worth
No stone unturned - true professional, great setup bud. Looks like you're doing everything in your power to recover from bicep surgery.
Ah kangen water plug
Would love to have a third of his setup at home
Haha! Love the new house updates, uckin bangin
Nice!
Good to meet you today at Arnolds Sports Festival
Lost respect when you confronted Larry, man up, be fking humble like you were. Can't even take a bit of words when you can offend someone with the intros and all of thors in ur video, zzzzz
Me watching this but I can’t eat 2 meals a day ☹️
Looks nice! I'm happy for you Eddie.
Did you get the idea from Derek MPMD?
Hard work=
Nothing wrong with tap water 🚰  you was brought up on stuff growing like most people in UK 🇬🇧
Wow your spar is 4 times bigger then my whole flat lol 😆 🙃  it's beautiful Eddie well deserved  👏  hard work pays off ,well done ..
Oh this is going to make me jealous. A home spa is like my goal in life.
We need i video training legs 🦵
Worlds strongest baby!
For a company that produces such a high tech device their website looks *REALLY* sketchy. They should probably get that sorted out for the purpose of future sales to be honest.
Pity he’s such a cry baby,I’ll get him some tissues to wipe his eyes
Happy recovery Ed. !!
Wtf haha
how can you get your back up to Larry  about a drawing nobody really gave two shits about when you literally had an animation of yourself pulling Thors head off. If you're gonna dish it out  least be able to take it fat lad you're embarrassing yourself.
This is wot hard work looks like
been waiting on this one!
You're house is every athlete dream.
all the gear
hogwarts
That sun bed is complete pseudo science
Where's the positivity towards me tho? :c
Yes something new .. Eddie pride of England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪
Larry's sorry
Best water in the world if fay scotland....eddie why you telling porky pies🤣🤣 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I really love it whenever Eddie talks about recovery or just these science facts for health. Really informative and helps me incorporate some of these in my life too :)
"viuh-men Dee"
A Yoor
You must have a ridiculous amount of money!!!
I know you've got to be but have you given up on arm wrestling?! Will you ever return to the WAL after Thor?
Eddie your house is really wonderful and has very beautiful things and you deserve all this thing for me that you made this dream with your own hands and made it and you are a sincere and lovable person and I love you from the bottom of my heart❤🔥👍🏻💪🏻
Eddies water-filtration is more complex than most peoples gyms
Well all the kangen water and fancy spa...lets get to some punching ed, besides the commercials.
Well done eddie, you have made something of you’re life and achieved what you set out to do. All we need now is another couples come dine with me in this house.
Oh cmon Eddie, who drinks 12 litres of water a day, haha
used to love this guy, now not so much, nobody likes a braggard, all your toys will be gone when your heart blows out chap
I use a vitamin D spray, you just spray it on the inside of your cheek and get 3000iu, everyone in the UK should take vitamin D through winter
I can see why he was one of the greatest strongman of all time this is recovery on a new level
Only 1 thing u miss there :D 1 bed for the moments when u feel to be alone and don`t wanna enter in the house :D all the best and keep with the video-s
Great place mate ,investment investment investment 💪
Well done fellow Stokie. Well pleased to see you doing so well
Eddie, you are awesome man, from Denmark, a simple guy from Guatemala, your vlogs always put a smile on my face,  I am a new follower and I am staying.
12 litres of water Thats impossible You would die!!!
(Now I know there are benefits to that water) but come on that is so unnecessary 🤣 rich people really spend a lot on unnecessary things
Go f yourself Eddie lost all respect for you the way you acted towards larry is shameless
Looks like my house , very nice! Good stuff mate.
Big respect Eddie calling Larry out he was deff shook🐍
Hypocritical man 😶
Episode 137 of Eddie being Brian's little brother ( Brian's Shelby vs Eddie's ranger) .... and yes I'm jealous lol
Eddie, your videos are always amazing and beautiful and you were so excited to see this beautiful video❤🤗🔥👌🏻
I’m very impressed
The death look Eddie gives passing cars on his street makes me definitely not want to drive past his house
Now all you need is surround sound, water resistance speakers, and blast music. AND IT IS 100% COMPLETE.
Eddie confronts Larry wheels. 👍
For all the Larry deluded haters out here, Have a reminder that Eddie made a whole animation of beating up Thor and ripping his head off. but when Larry did it to just "PROMOTE" the fight and hype it up. Eddie gets mad like a toddler. Hypocritical.
Eddies house is a science lab.
Big Love Eddie❤🔥👊🏻
Eddie hall - Beast, Strongman, Boxer, Architect
Be careful with the sauna, it dehydrates.
Why did you come in so hard on Larry ? You had decapitated head intros of Thor in your video too way before that pic he posted , that’s a bit hypocritical man.
Just WOW.
Eddie the pool has become much more beautiful than before and a very cool design🏊🏻❤👊🏻
Yøøøøøøøøø
Eddies house is like a whole kingdom bruh
Mom I want a boxing training video. We have boxing training videos at home  Boxing training videos at home: LOOK AT MY SPA
Time to see the quality of sauna.
Eddie just see the video Larry I just 💩 a 🧱 Wheels uploaded hahahahaha it was so funny seeing him like that anyway Thor next buddy 💯🇬🇧💪🏻🥊
Those pavers look like shit
Larry took a side snake 🐍
Must have some sort of a Tardis!
He should apologise for his pathetic childish chat with Larry Wheels… embarrassing
I was legitimately just watching the past tours and said to myself I wonder when the next one will be up, as I came on to  my home page, hear it is
Reminds me of the Bubble Works at Chessington. Love it. 😀
Hard work pays off brother. Lovely pad Eddie 🖐️
Eddie Your Ford is literally gorgeous with the Beast logo on it really amazing🔥👌🏻
Amazing🔥
I gotta say.. that is a pretty sweet crib you got here.
Eddie, we can't watch your video and be at the arnold strongman classic at the same time mate 💪😂
Nice
At this point you'll never have to leave your house.
Should've put Larry in a headlock since he wants to play games with you
looking good mate and good to see you today at arni fest
Let's go beast.[btw would love to see you box somebody. Plss do. ]. Beast for life 🙅🏻‍♂️
Some say the bubles in Eddie’s jacuzzi is fuelled by Eddie himself! 💨 🛁
Beautiful home Eddie, them vehicles are class. Never seen a hot tub as big in my life! You could bid for the next Olympics with that! Haha
The Beast House Returns
Handled yourself well against Larry my man
Big love the best 💪🏼😉
Great meeting you at the arnolds bro, humble guy👍🏼👍🏼
THE BEAST LIVES ON FOREVER
Ain’t gonna make you a better boxer than Thor
You can get me a new home spa too
🔥🔥🔥
Great meeting you eddie 💪🏻💪🏻
Looks great 👍
Hi
🐐
First
