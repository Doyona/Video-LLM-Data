"just like a coat of Armour" Best quote - Peter Jones 😂
This is an April Fools right?
not for the first time Duncan doesn't know what he's talking about.  Just like the heating product
I worry about the consequences of giving chickens the means to fight back
Reminds me of Big Poppa Pump (anyone?)
Was this the April fool special ?
Duncan does the cooking sometimes, Peter's offer for half at 24%
Environmental friendly ? - not for the chickens and turkeys it ain't..
She didn't quite get the roasting that other entrepreneurs have received from Dragons.
Their servants should be consulted on this cooking product idea.
Chain mail does not hold moisture in and doesn't make it cook differently.
What episode and series was this?
It's pathetic the way rich people flex about never cooking a meal.
It looks like a medieval implement designed by an old head mistress. Yet, here we are in mid 2025 and we're still using tin foil. Pretty sure even Julia Child would be impressed!
She said it lets out the steam but that is what the tin foil does is keeps in the steam to aid the cooking, keeping moist and tender.
Any chefs on here? Yay or nay?
Wow never cooked huh
Who'd a thought. A Scot inventing something that saves  you money
Mithril
Fabulous product
Hello, my name is ..Blythe Duff !
not gonna lie...that would look awesome sewn on my leather jacket
Sadly no repeat orders
Duncan's input on his cooking just made me want a Hell's Kitchen crossover.
This was a bit awkward at the end
£14 sounds pretty reasonable, blacksmiths don't come cheap.
I’ll invest $700,000 for 0% equity, contingent that $100 is used to go to a hair salon
I want to buy it
Theo : "I've never cooked"   That's how you know a dude is born into money. Totally out of touch with reality.
Freedom!!! 🗡️😣⛓️
When Debra holds her earlobe, she's going to make an offer. It was interesting how long she thought about it this time with her hand already in. She makes offers without doing it too, but if I was pitching and she was holding her ear, I'd be stoked.
She looks like Mrs Beaton
Well its been over ten yrs and ive never seen any for sale 😮
I really don't see how it works.
How would you clean that?
What a terrible investment.
Can you imagine cleaning this ? No thanks
Is Duncan wearing a chain mail tie?
Duncan has no idea lol.  Sure everyone said it was nice when he made it with no tin foil but listen,  they said it to be nice.  Covering chicken is great and you should always cover or after it has cooked for sure, and for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour. Another thing, covering a chicken whilst cooking has several advantages, it can stop burning to fast, it retains a ton of the moisture and several other things but what is great about this actual product is that you can still crisp the chicken up which you cant if you covered the chicken the entire time of cooking with normal tin foil  Duncan should just say he does not understand the product or cooking, not say all of the silly things he did.  Jesus I am getting old and changing over time, I was worried about what the latest game releases were coming out etc seemingly not that long ago and yet now I am an expert in vacuum cleaners for carpets and how to cover a chicken for a decent roast
This is now made obsolete with the increase usage of steam bake ovens . In which the oven produces small amount of steam to keep the moisture of the items you are trying to bake inside .
Feo thetus
Deborah I don't cook. Meaden
Chain mail lol
well done chicken lady :)
Great product idea for sure
Duncan is actually so ignorant so often when he argues against a product. 😂
she was looking for a shopping chain that did mail order
2024 - £34.99 at Lakeland!
Excellent....
there should be some irony somewhere in the chicken getting  armour after its head was cut off.
"If it didn't cost 29,95 I'd rush and buy one tomorrow"  Kinda funny to hear that.. from an investor... on dragon's den...
Really great idea!
Company dissolved in 2017. I guess her business plans were foiled.
This woman got screwed by big corps that stole her idea, then choke-holded her by saying she made exaggerated claims on her site.
Wikipedia  Roastcosy's investment was never completed. A publicised investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority on the company's products may have impacted on the deal. Company was dissolved by 2017.
Chain mail for chickens. Brilliant!
Duncan is not smart sometimes
I'm wondering why this product was discontinued. Lots of positive reviews on Amazon and elsewhere
This is the FIRST lady I've seen admit that the deals aren't just about percentage of equity. She's right in saying you can't quantify the experience & contacts, etc. that these investors bring to the table. ✌🏻
£30 ain't bad for a fancy kitchen accessory when you consider people are happy to pay £500 for fancy knives.
I think it's good!
The lady is right but if a product is profitable
The basting bit is a real winner for me
I like the product! BUT....My only concern would be how easy would it be to clean. I am surprised that the Dragons didn't pick up on the convenience factor of aluminium foil and whether this would be any good for wrapping your picnic sandwiches in. It would certainly be good for roasts and the like with the ease of basting, but whilst it would reduce the use of aluminium foil, it would not eliminate it. I also couldn't quite understand the conflicting statements of retaining moisture, but allowing steam to escape and the ease of basting.
all thats missing is a viking helmet
Could this be difficult to clean?
just like all that people who thinks they can sing enter singing shows...I blame their families
The first question in my mind was ''how do you clean it?'' then I realised how poor I am
They always say “strict den rules dictate….”  But I’ve never seen a judge or official came out bustin skulls if they offered less $ and the entrepreneur accepted.
“Tin foil is non degradable.” Yeah but it’s 100% recyclable. Plus, how does this retain moisture with holes in it? Jesus…
Lol. Duncan announcing he had a roast that was cooked without foil like that's a slam dunk argument against her product. She put him in his place nicely. I think the product is brilliant, but I haven't seen it anywhere but here so I guess it didn't work out
Day 6 and 1000 clips later
Its ace that would defo sell great idea, duncan is so far wrong here….
patent no one asked!
Peter isn't writing. He's drawing someone begging him for money.
I don't get this chainmail substitute for an aluminum foil. The chainmail is totally porous, you can see it is made of big rings with huge holes in them. How will this porous chainmail keep moisture in like aluminum foil? Ridiculous! I guess all of the dragons failed their basic science classes in school, that's why nobody asked this.
Deborah has the hots for Peter I think
Is this so the vegans can stop you cutting off a slice??
Duncan used to frequently argue about stuff he knew nothing about, arrogance at its finest
Can't believe Hilary is not here anymore 💔
Good luck cleaning it, it will take an hour. This is why it doesn't exist in the market. Tinfoil you just throw away.
Buy some armor for your chicken
I would buy these even if it doesn't work
£2.80 per foil roll?? Where on earth is she shopping it costs like £1 per roll where I live
Remind me never to eat at Duncans house
Tin foil is not environmentally unfriendly because it isn't bio degradable but because of high energy costs. In germany over 90% of tin foil gets to be recycled. But melting it takes a lot of energy. That's why other things can easily score better than tin foil in a life cylce assessment.
My chickens often enter into local jousting competitions so this body armour is perfect im gonna order 10 for the whole team
This is brilliant and every food dude would want one. I was nervous about cleaning but shaking it in soapy water, the friction would do the job.
I can not believe know body asked how do you clean this and will it get rusty over time.      that said I liked it and wish all involved success:)
Saw this on @sorted recently
Duncan Ban-A-Tin-Foil
Duncan: "I royally screwed up here and im too proud to admit it so...Im out"
Aluminum is bad for u id get this
Chicken chainmail
70% of aluminium circulating today has been recycled. It’s one of the materials that’s cheaper to recycle than mine new.
Rip hilary devey
I'm a buyer. this is cool 😊
So what we learned here today is: Never go for a sunday roast at Duncan's place.
Duncan loves dry chicken and meat
Peter is very calculative, give half at 24% so that she still has 52% which is majority shareholding then negotiate downwards.. clever!
Greedy dragons
Throughout the video I was like 'Don't give away half of your company .. it's such a great idea ..'  and she did it .. 48% is not a deal it's being robbed.
How did it go after?
Hillary has not been on the show dunce 2012.
Should have also mentioned the dangers of aluminium foil at high temperature on our foods. I believe there's a correlation between old age Dementia and the longterm chemicals that break off from these materials into our blood stream through food
SILVER FOIL? hey Deborah, your rich is showing!
They know the product is good but at a very early stage, so they hammered her down to get the higher percentage. Not bad for them.
10 seconds in. Chicken Armor Chain Mail ⛓️
Wow why everybody has to be a Gordon Ramsay?
How are you supposed to clean that?

Conspiracy chicken...😁 Makes a great Faraday cage for your meat 🍖 😀
48%!   These greedy scoundrels!
Brilliant product, the price is good, enviro friendly.  I want to know what Cruella De-Ville’s workout regime is?? would love shoulders like hers.
“One day we could see £30 chainmail used solely for resting a chicken in every house!”  Fast forward to today and people are turning down free spuds cos they can’t afford the gas to boil them.
That business  godess is smart she is gonna get a lot of help
Her: Hello  Peter: I’m out…
And Duncan displays his lack of knowledge in how to cook a succulent Roast Chicken.
Isn't Deborah a vegan? Maybe she wasn't back when this was filmed.
This is actually pretty cool.
Tin  is environmentally safe you melt it down and make something…🇬🇧
I would buy this without a doubt! Oh and lovely dress Debra. 💐
Looks like she’s sending the turkey to the crusades
Oh I can see them now chickens running round outside with chainmail & an helmet & a shield & sword going cluck cluck cluck catch me now !...if you can !
This is rubbish, it performs nothing like foil
JENNY - “ I love it! This could be in every house in the next 10 years” …… JENNY - “ I’m out”  😅😩😩
she says good bye with her hand when she says im out! Sweet
she argues very well! The cooking lesson was really a sales pitch. Smart woman
Actually Duncan was right. By extracting the water from beef or chicken, it intensifies the flavor.
Nice lady. Happy for her!
I cook 3 times a day everyday and I would never buy this. I use tin foil maybe once a month
Bannantyne is such a man baby- lost him temper because she told him the truth about how to cook a chicken.
Has Ballantine ever invested in anything……. To busy investing in young ladies …allegedly
Thought she was gonna flog Syrups ….
I want this how to buy it?
Now imagine dropping a red-hot chainmail on your foot by accident while cooking a chicken...That's why we use aluminum foil instead of stainless steel. That's what you could call a high-risk investment ..
Don't mean to be negative but I wouldn't  like to clean  it, whereas foil is throaway....
First thing I'd do if I was her would be to approach qvc and other TV shopping channels lol people will buy anything on there and just moan about it....
My first thought is ‘can it be thoroughly and easily cleaned between uses?’
When i saw this i was like i need this in my life until she said £30 wow
Theo doesn’t know anything about cooking but owns Robert Dyas!,
Never mentioned how you clean it
Amazing, cook one chicken and be bussy for half a day to try cleaning this invention... soap, hot water and chemicals for saving the invirement from aluminium.. good luck!
This is a genius invention
I cannot see and hear Leo without hearing and seeing that comedian fellow who impersonates him.
dragons are like - hands up, this is a robbery!
Imagine cleaning that thing. Nightmare. It’ll be a breeding ground for salmonella and bacteria after a couple of uses.
Reggae sauce 😊
Billionaires crying about £29😭
You have to hold moisture in when cooking meat it would never work and how would you clean it  ??
Why do they call it tin foil when it's aluminium?? 🤔
So it’s been 10 years, first I hears about this product was today and her company closed 5 years ago
The most unwanted invention ever! Jesus 🤣
Funny when the non cookers put their two cents in about cooking and the product, when they have no clue what they are talking about lol
Mithril
Imagine cleaning this!
what an utter fool 😂 just a ridiculous product destined to get obliterated
Never used foil to cook a roast
environmentally friendly for the climate change of LGBTQX BLM diversity pronouns  kneetaking stay at home save lives white privilege.  WHen lefties tried to reduce the human race to a series of pointless slogans.  and the rest of us laughed
“Oh and it’s very environmentally friendly and - “ “Your not answering my questions. How is this cheaper than a lifetime of tinfoil “ What a prat. Worst dragon ever
If you was to forget to wash it what is the Risk of salmonella
Sexier then some birds I've seen in the same gear 🤣🤣
Can you imagine the state of that thing after a few uses. It'll be covered in rotting grease in no time. Ridiculous idea.
Do you only use it at Knight?
I want one!!!
Ahh, just perfect for when your chicken wants to go to battle, some chainmail armour
Cooking with foil at high temp isn't healthy it leaches. Stainless steel doesn't
all these dragons who "have never cooked" xD
Peter your the  man and what can I say about Theo big don
I knight thee sir Gobblealot for thy triumphs in battle
It’s so pleasing to see them shaking hands again after all the conVid nonsense!
Will we have to slice the meat with a sword after tendering it with a spiked hammer
Duncan hadn't a clue about what he was talking about
What a ridiculous invention
This is a parody of rich people. On the next episode they'll learn how to use a stove.
The way debbie took so long, pretending to ponder and wonder and think, she had made her mind up within seconds, the pondering and wondering and pretending, was to make it seem like a much better deal and an offer she really didnt know whether to make or not lol  Its quite funny
What about hygiene?? How do you get the flesh bits of it after cooking??
That is some thumbnail my God
I'm so happy she got an investment!
No one asked about cleaning the thing !
Roast Cozy and Duncan's Tie @5:20 are both seeking your attention.
I lost it when Peter said, "so this is something you put around your chicken before you put it in the over".
Peter: so you wrap it around your chicken, before you put it in the oven 😀😃🙂🙃😊😇😀😃🙂🙃😊😇😀😃🙂🙃😊😇😀
Ethereum
I like this comment.
She got eaten by the tall dragon & blonde dragon 😝😝😝😝😝😂😂😂😂😂😂
What on earth is Duncan even talking about in this video...
Duncan is just sheit at cooking is what i learned
Tumbleweed blowing through from 10:38 🤣
Peter: Youre asking for too much money. Hillary: Youll need a lot more money. Rest: I would need to ask my butler, if this was a useful product.
It’s nothing like tin foil. I cover things in the oven with tin foil to stop them burning and keep in steam. Chain Mail doesn’t
Grogu wants his armor back.
🤔DEBORAH ! have you  seen the PATENT PAPERs?! 🤔 or do you ONLY ask for them,  when it's CONVENIENT ? 🤔
What's up with 💸dragons den❓
I'm now looking for this delicious chicken armour
Nobody asked anything about patent or anyone just copying the idea
Chicken with chainmail +10 AC
It would be a living nightmare to clean it after using...
Ill negotiate…if you change your hairdresser..  yesterday.
I just cant help it.. im going…going..going ….💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
And my usual question people,  how do this business work out ?
I'd put it over my hand while I cut vegetables and then put it on the meat.
This is tailormade for Medieval Times restaurants since roast chicken is the main dish they serve
Duncan looking at a chicken burnt to crisp and looking like a piece of coal: ''The chicken's still ok, it's just lost all the moisture''
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 im sorry but this was never going to catch on
I didn't realise Nicola Sturgeon had a side business
I've never seen Debra take so long to make a call.
I actually think this idea is great. Looks silly but would thrive in today market with the current environmental mindset
Interesting idea.
Anyone want some Scott Steiner Turkey? Holler, if ya hear me!
fantastically well done and may the business flourish.
So this is where Baby Yoda's Mandalorian armour actually came from 😱
Bet it's annoying to wash up
I really liked the product and she seemed lovely. I think a big problem though is being able to tell when the turkey is safe to eat. If we were to fit a flowsignal
She was delightful
How does chain mail help retain moisture?
my mum used to just covered things with a dish cloth and then washed them
Anti-Brexit and pro China Debs . . . . .shame i used to like her.
A terrible invention made by a terrible looking man
What year was this aired?
Fast-forward to today, we find that she initially made money from making chainmail for chickens, then the product line was expanded to include a shield and a sword for chickens, then she made money from rebranding a rust prevention spray that chickens can use to keep their chainmail, shields and swords rust-free.
Such a lovely lady, hope she got her success
If Duncan doesn't understand why you want to keep the moisture in, he must eat rubber chicken. Go into Hell's Kitchen and give the scallops a 10/10.
Just googled this... Debra and Peter took this product to Uzbekistan and they're selling the product to over 5000 independent stores. You will find the most succulent lamb and checked company house... It made a turn over of 6.7 billion Uzbekistani So'm.
I actually like the idea and would buy this
These merry band of chicken brothers must have fought together on succulent St. Crispy's Day.
Caveman duncan, I cook it take it out is done, he is a proper man man, but missing the point, that he would of had more chicken, and it will cook quicker
YES THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THE FULL LENGTH CLIPS!
Do you people not have oven bags?
Chicken farming is so far from environmentally friendly it kind of defeats the objective.  Just saying 🤷‍♀️
Duncan is a clown. Unless you know what you're talking about, don't attempt to pick apart a pitch. Obvious that he barely ever cooks.
Duncan should just say he’s not interested. Watching him trying to argue against something he clearly doesn’t know is funny
Anyone seen Chicken Run? She’s reminding me of the farmer’s wife wanting to make her chicken pies 😂
She was great happy she got the deal
Product failed in the end, website is gone, no longer for sale. RIP
Doggone it. I totally want one.
Barren woman who doesn’t cook. Good job she inherited well
I prefer dry chicken actually
Who wouldn't want to put Frodo's Armor on their chicken?
I want one!
I want to get one for my mates cat it's always getting into scraps
Mon the well!
Of course, Deborah Meaden turns up at home shouting "Where's me dinner" to her slavish husband.
8:35 That was the biggest gulp I've ever seen on Dragons' Den when made an offer haha
If there isn’t a lift, I’m out.
It really did take off. 10 years later and you can find it (and many many knock offs) everywhere.
Washing it would be a nightmare, with tinfoil you can just throw it away.
I definitely don't spend anything close to £2.80 for Asda brand tinfoil
The most environmentally friendly thing to do would be not to eat chicken in the first place - the tin foil issue is a red herring.
How come no one questioned the lack of patent protection? Someone could easily come up with a similar chain mail at lesser cost and bankrupt this lady.
Stainless Steel? should have used Beskar
Tin foil is not bad for the environment because it doesn't break down, it's bad because of mining and the manufacturing process using a lot of energy. If you leave tin foil in nature it won't damage the environment, like plastic does.
It would be a nightmare to wash that would
What’s next? A shield for a ham? A Lance for a lamb?
They are just money grabbers..I hope they fail..
Deal didn’t close. Very little trace of them on the internet, only an ASA complaint about exaggerated claims on their website. The company was dissolved in 2017. Looks like they failed to get off the ground.
Jenny: "it's a bit mediaeval so for that reason, I'm joust"
But you have no head!  Chicken: Tis but a scratch!
I always wrap something around my chicken before I put it in the oven.
So, it allows steam to escape, but it doesn't allow moisture to escape? 🤔
Winner, Winner, chainmail chicken for dinner!
My gal smashed it! Business now worth 20 mil! What a boss lady!
Why not just NOT cook Chicken to begin with if it damages the environment? This looks like something in a medieval tavern!
Feel sorry for her a little. 48% is a lot and I think Peter is the greediest dragon
dissolved company now. i knew it would be.  i suspected she'd only sell a handful maybe on a shopping channel.  she had a massive challenge to convince the decreasing non vegan population that they have been cooking their chicken the wrong way all this time by using tin foil. yes, meats can use a bit of moisture but there are far cheaper ways to resolve that problem for the next time than buying a product worth. £29.99.  most chefs are stubborn too, they won't pay for this product when they know their chicken has turned out nice 9 x times of of 10.  she's only targetting a very small number of people who are rubbish cooks, and most people who are rubbish cooks don't bother cooking at all. since they know they are a rubbish cook they wouldn't go out and spend £6-12 on a chicken they know won't turn out nice.
In case you want to take your chicken into battle for Isengard.
well its been ten years and they are still around and being sold in a variety of different product ranges
Duncans ego was crushed so he is oot
The deal subsequently failed.
Anyone knows the update?
Let me rephrase what Duncan said: My chef cooked the roast and we ate and enjoyed it.
I just buy a ready to cook chicken in a bag from Aldi. Coz it's in the bag, it doesn't splatter in the oven, so it saves the messing about!
It produces the most succulent meat imaginable! The gravy makes itself. Not so much a gadget, more an essential piece of cookware.
The company was dissolved in 2014.
Im curious what mr. Wonderful would have said ..we all know who would be out first too..
75k is too much for Hillary to invest, but she spends that every year on booze and cigarettes
I feel like chicken to knight
The company is valued at 3.24 million now. And have diversified their range.
Even if this thing does cook a chicken better, it’s no 30 quid product
And if your turkey is suddenly called to war, it’ll be fully prepared
It's all very Alan Partridge. Armour for turkeys; wetsuits for chickens.
most of them don't cook because they have personal chefs 😂 upper class for you
When You Need Allies To Become Elden Lord:
Great invention, now i want the pork one
Lol I just had chicken wings for dinner, without chain mail
Don't forget to buy one of these when you go to Moria!
I don't see how this makes a chicken crispy.
Hold! Hoolld! Hooooold! Unleash the battle chickens!! 🐔  😂
Chicken = + 10 strength and +10 stamina
Ok, this is EPIC!!!!
Washing that would be a pain
This is a great product, too bad peoples mentality does not change. And the lady s a darling.
I don't cook chicken, but I still want one for a toy!!!
Meanwhile 10 years later, we are still using tinfoil
Will it not tint the flavour of the chicken
How have they never cooked, or don't cook?
Must be a pain to clean it lol.
If it would have come with a banner, shield and a sword. I would say sold
After having seen how Duncan cooks it's no wonder he doesn't get why dry chicken is a bad thing.
"i've never cooked" "i don't cook" - do some people actually eat out for every meal???
Seems like some sort of Minecraft mod
Come on Hillary, if you can’t afford to buy that then you can’t invest 😬
Chicken To-knight 🤔🍻
It's no horse armor dlc.. but I'm intrigued!
hi
*narrator voice* "there wasn't"
Chainmail for Turkeys? 👀👀
Here we go! Chainmail armour for turkeys. Perfection
Hi everyone
