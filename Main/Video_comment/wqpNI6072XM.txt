proud of you laroiiiii
Psalms 68:6 God makes a home for the lonely; He leads out the prisoners into prosperity, Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land.  Isaiah 6:46 We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness is as a filthy rag; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  John 14:6 Jesus saith, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  1 Corinthians 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.  Acts 2:38 Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit  Isaiah 1:16-17 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.  Matthew 13:50 This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Oh my god I love this

Fire
When he was 15 I was like, this kid will blow up and look at where he is this shows that you can accomplish anything just set your mind on it Proud of you
Best song of the album
Bro your killing it every track you pit out is a banger
musica foda🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥
any of the ppl that disliked jus stfu honestly
The album is about the opposite of its name. But I am suprized he got polo G and Justin bieber on the same album . Also Stunna Gambio being on an album with these two when I never heard of him.
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc
i know i said i wouldnt but i fell in love again- Still Chose You/ i hate to say it but i fell in love again - Hate Her Friends
For me this is the best song on the album. It's least fave project from him but this and maybe 2 others will stay in my rotation
🔥🔥🔥

cant wait for this music video directed by cole bennett
Broowww !!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
ayy someone's going bigggg, I hear the prod taggg🔥🔥🔥🔥
“All of these hoes but I still chose you”….I’m sorry is this supposed to be a compliment or something? This kid is literally a kid. He doesn’t even have enough life experience to be talking about love to this degree, everyone thinks they know what love it when they are a teenager and inevitably look back and fucking cringe. He hasn’t even had enough time to actually develop genuine relationships due to his teen idol tik tok career, and as aforementioned his age. Kid is acting like he’s on his 3rd marriage and has kids by 4 different women. And every single he has seems to disparage all the women he encounters as hoes, how many hoes do you really know buddy? lol! And if all the girls you have been with are hoes, the only common denominator is you, meaning you can’t discern a compatible person from those who you are simply sexually attracted to, which coincidentally is most girls when you are a teenager with raging hormones. Also maybe stop calling all girls hoes and you might find a semi decent one.
This sound more like a remix or a continuation of something
I just know this is gonna be a banger
Jorja smith or where is that intro from
Bro i can see juice up in the sky with a cup in one hand and a blunt in the other boping to this with a smile telling everybody there thats my boy

The people that disliked this song should get covid tests done, because one of the major symptoms is no taste
lyrics here-  (Mustard on the beat, ho) Here I am, here I am, here I am I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again Know I said I wouldn't but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh)  [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you We're all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh) All of these hoes and I still chose you We're all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you   Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)  [Verse 1] That's what I promised I was never gon' do...  [Pre-Chorus] Here I am, here I am, here I am I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again (Love again) Know I said I wouldn't but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh) [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you We're all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (No)   Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh) All of these hoes and I still chose you (Oh, oh) We're all that I want and I still want you, oh (Oh, oh) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)  [Verse 2] You know, out of anyone, that it's hard for me to show my love ... I should've known I wasn't ready to fall in love again  [Pre-Chorus] Here I am, here I am, here I am I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again (Love again)   Know I said I wouldn't but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Love)  [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you We're all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (No) Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh) All of these hoes and I still chose you (Oh, oh) We're all that I want and I still want you, oh (Oh, oh) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)

The Kid LAROI - Still Chose You  [Intro: Jorja Smith & YG] I can see your face, see the light in your eyes I can see the change, feel the heat of the fire If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive Both feet on the line, by any means, I will— (Mustard on the beat, ho)  [Pre-Chorus] Here I am, here I am, here I am I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did  [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you With all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh) All of these hoes and I still chose you With all that I want and I still want you, oh I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh)  [Verse 1] That's what I promised I was never gon' do I said, "Fuck love" 'fore I ever met you (Oh yeah) Three different girls in a day, I'm ashamed But with all that I've been through, girl, who could you blame? Oh Trust issues, I still got 'em That's why I'm always tweakin' with you on some lil' problems And you know it's different for me, I came out the real bottom Why the fuck you stressin' on me? You know I got real problems (Real problems) [Pre-Chorus] Here I am, here I am, here I am (Oh) I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Oh-oh)  [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Oh, oh) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (No, no) All of these hoes and I still chose you (Woah) With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Want you, oh) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Never gon do, oh)  [Verse 2] You know, out of anyone, that it's hard for me to show my love Hope you don't go to everyone Tell 'em everything that I tell you, no Oh, 'cause I'm so sure 'bout you I hope I'm not wrong I know where this is headed 'cause I've been here before But I can't blame nobody but me, it's my fault (Oh) I should've known I wasn't ready to fall in love again [Pre-Chorus] Here I am, here I am, here I am I know I said I wouldn't but I fell in love again (Fell in love again) Know I said I wouldn't, but look at where I am I just pray that you don't do me like the other ones did (Love)  [Chorus] All of these hoes and I still chose you With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (No) 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do (Oh) All of these hoes and I still chose you (Chose) With all that I want and I still want you, oh (Woah, oh, oh) I can't believe that I'm trippin' on you (You) 'Cause that's what I promised I was never gon' do  [Outro: Jorja Smith] If you can feel the pain, then you know you're alive Both feet on the line, by any means, I will—
