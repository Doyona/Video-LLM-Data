Why did you not put in majicarp it is literally the fish pokemon
When you mentioned poultry, would you include Delibird to your list?
tatsugiri already is literal live sushi. think of it. its a salmon based Pokemon laying on top of rice.
What about magicarp? It’s as big as a salmon and it’s pretty easy to fish.
12:53 no way it was made with flipaclip
Corphish is delicious. It looks like a mix between a crayfish and a shrimp, so it probably tastes pretty good.
5:50 to skip ad
Are you sure you don't want to eat the ice cream pokemon
When he was talking about fish and asked what better pokemon to eat i thought miltank. Other than miltank. I love him. Hes also smexy
You knew about the ice pop berries when you made the every interesting sword and shield deck video
idea  bound sweet sweet +petiletel tea
3:23
I don't think you want to eat a psionic pig.  I don't think you want to eat meat that has been psionically charged with misery and suffering.
3:29?"I'll eat his mom though" 👀
11:55 ever tried fried crab claw? Delish. And kingler has a big claw
Why is this my comfort video??? Like fr when I'm at home and my anxiety kicks in I can watch this video and I'm fine??
I know that alcremie gives the cream your not killing alcreamie
NO  T-T
NO

3:23 ayo
Oinkologne is literally just a plain pig. Why didn't you think of it? You already mentioned lechonk.
2:48 Oinkologne (or whatever the evolution of lechonk is called) could also be a good meal choice
Looking it up Torchic is actually larger than some real world Chicken breeds
Mnnnn Cicken nuget
vanillish and vanillite
magikarp
3:11
2:02
that is just rude man 3:23
*ahem ahem* *shows a paper* "pokemon were married to people"😭
2:40 Lechonk evo?
i am sort of curious what the meat of a crustle or dwebble would taste like... not the rock though
5:52 YAAAAAY!!! (sheep is my favourite animal in the real animal kingdom)
0:16 the thing is that book said used to that one lady in Pokémon Colosseum definitely didn’t read they used to part
Onikalon
What about crabs and lobsters? Water Pokemon fish!
Very late, but this is preety much Pokemon's version of Peta's worst nightmares in one video
Hear me out: Aerodactyl. No I will not explain
Gigantamax creamy is literally a cake
2:00 zesty Mikey💀
You know Michael, I once used an Unfezant on my Pokemon sword team, and he was pretty good. So it wasn't all that dumb in my books.  Plus I do like Unfezant.
4:03 Uhmm don’t you think that’s a little harsh even for Michael
Disrespectful😂 13:29
With the flechling.... thing, is it like how we almost made bull extinct
"Ill eat his mom though"                                           -MandJVT
who else here would eat pikachu-
Vanilite
I’m sorry, Mikey, but your pants are on fire. You discussed the berry smoothies in your sword and shield Crazy poke dexs entry’s video.
Two Pokemon dipplin and gmax alcremie
Scovillan
3:21 “I’m not gonna eat Bambi. I’ll eat his mom, though.” -Michael from MandJTV, 2022
Oh my god royal pear is in this
I'm sorry but those sub headings at the bottom don't machup. It says porygon when he's talking about wlopoke
wishiwashi scool form a lot of fish to cook
rewatching this after seeing Mega Malamar... I wonder how Mikey would feel now with his new friend Malamar 😅
We see shuckle juice in pokemon Horizons it looks like orange juice
I will say. I’d try the majority of these. The only exclusions are the fish and the shinottic line.   I’m allergic to Fish (not seafood in general) and I just don’t like how mushrooms taste.   So long as I don’t have to prepare the meat itself. I’d probably cry.
You just have to cut of its uterus and as it is screaming of agony break its bones to imobilize the miltank then you can chop it up and while it is alive and that will make it have the most painful death possible and you can have a nice meal
I would enjoy some of the meat and fruit and vegetable Pokémon and I want to say Mikey I enjoy your videos so much and they always put a smile on my face. Also I would have some of the fish Pokémon as well because I love my fish so much.
I know some of you freaks would say lopbunny or guardevuar
I mean, go lie, but you can also eat horses
6:22 what abut vullaby? Edit: I’m so late
Not creamy
What only plant Pokémon would you eat?
Bro what abaot vanilux
2:00:00 is the best part
I like turtle stew so big man Blaatoise and is cooked... literally. And I feel like if you chopped the plant on Bulbasaur's back it'd make a great lettuce or csbage substitute
0:36 Why didn’t he mention Slowpoke Curry? I’d eat it
Fun fact: Morelull’s Sword entry says: “Pokémon living in the forest eat the delicious caps on Morelull's head. The caps regrow overnight.”
I’m surprised drowsey isn’t in here 😂
Oinkalone
Eat is 🦜🦜🦜🦜🦜
Mint is a common Bug repellent, and we eat it.  If you grow Mint, it's common for Hedgehogs to come and chew it up and put the mint over their bodies to get rid of fleas and other parasites.
I love to eat pokemon
Ribombee is too cute to be eaten :(
5:39 - “It’s blue, right?” Made me smile.
Ive tried pigeon before i went to a restaurant ordered a meal thinking it was chicken in the photo but when i asked the waiter what bird this was he said it was pigeon
13:35 WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO OUR FRIEND MALAMAR
5:35 got me hystericaly laughing
3:22 Mandjtv Out of Context
honey
I feel like with miltank, tropius and chancey, you could have a pretty healthy and delicious breakfast.
And then i'll eat bambi
Tauros isn't a cow
Is that guy on the thumbnail ai?
John would hate you for the piloswine part
Not Myanmar😡😡
Want to add something to this list: Mega KalaMalamari It’s Malamar.. but more :D
3:31 Had bison burgers at a cookout at my grandparents house. 7.8/10 I was terrified I was going to get mad cow disease the whole time. But otherwise it was really good👍
No, I imagine that heavenly taste of zapduos
Pumpkin cookie
Me personally, I would eat a good scovillian.
do you think ivysaur’s leaves are edible? like instead of lettuce?
Magikarp
Miltank haters unite for tonight we hunt meat!

I love pumpkin too
An exorcism sounds like a lot of effort for some pumpkin. 😂
TATSUGIRI I’D GO CRAZY FOR A TATSUGIRI
2:45 yay you won’t eat him 😊
I love his juice 2:23
Rewatching this and just want to let Mikey know that pumpkin goes really good with Turkey meat
9:58 pumpkin spiced mercury
5:22 LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT DUDE 😭  And yes ik its a bluegrass joke or smth
7:58
The power of magic and editing
Fun fact, Swirlix’s fur just tastes just like cotton candy. It itself isn’t made out of cotton candy, but next time you shave your totally real Swirlix, be sure to keep this in mind.
10:03 I don't know if this counts but i have eaten rice with meat, and pumpkin
Mikey is perfect for this video when he even likes pumpkin flavored everything (I’ve been sick of that kind of thing for a bit).
I dont know what i expected but now im super hungry
Hear me out pikachu I just really want that dumb rat dead
Michael!! 3:24
Why do i think sammurot would taste good …
2:10 but Michael, there are no such things as bdsp, it was all one of darkrai’s nightmare things
Pumpkin is so highly overrated, and I'm so sick of seeing literally everything flavored with it every fall. Also, pumpkin has a ton of fiber and will give you the raging shits if you eat too much.
Try pumpkin and blueberry cheesecake
This is like a rooster fight. When someone loses, they turn a rooster into fried chicken.
Idk about u but a bulbisoar salad sounds great
The small dragon fish in paldaya
0:00 Greetings Michael, Pokefan here
What about the ice cream Pokémon?
1:04 plus nacli salt😋
Tatsugiri is just sushi
3:22 Unhinged out of context Mikey comment
You forgot about seafood
3:40 miltank rant
Make sense human can eat dogs which is man's best friend
Well, there’s also Oinkologne which is basically a normal pig, but just smells really good
You can also grilled in KFC style Ho-oh
14:42 drowzee
2:37 mankey is a pig
I think millank is really cute
RUFFLET IT WOULD BE TASTY ITS JUST LIKE MILTANK ITS SOO ANOYIN
What about fidough
9:58 is it me or does that bag next to the Cheerios looks like a bag of pumpkin pie dog treats
Bulbasaur's bud may be poisonous but if not it could maybe be edible  Some flower buds are edible let's hope this one is (As long as it's not attached and wont grow back because that might end up with it ...)
BROOOOO G-MAX Alcreamy
Hear me out... Pincurchin. Uni (Sea urchin meat) is delicious.
In horizons shuckles juice is a common thing to drink
Polteageist's tea is said to be delicious so i'd be down to taste it
“ Not Bambi, I’ll Eat His Mom Tho”🤨😏😭
Magikarp sems very tasty to me
I love those foods too and fried calamari so much!! And all the foods you like too because they are more something i would eat in the pokemon world
3:23 😧
I love pmpkin bread
i would eat squrituls tail
Anyone had snake meat? Kill an Arbok, cos' it's a jerk, and you soon have some snake burgers going.
8:35 well they are talking about the skin of the pie on his back
3:21 yep
Creeeeeeaaaaaam 14:26
Sweat 9:06
Eating Pokémon alive 8:29
Shukles juice 2:02
Just a note, whenever an animal in real life looks like food, it is because its a parasite. So be careful eating the "food" pokemon
Take MooMoo Milk  Superheat it  Add Flapple’s acid spit  Play with the curd until you have mozzarella   Cover it in egg wash and flour and panko  You now have fried cheese
The vanillite line is just ice cream isn't it? And what about oinkolonge?
MIKEY DON'T THE MUSHROOM ITS GONNA TURN U HIGH AS HELL
chill mikey what the miltank do to you😂
I am pretty sure it’s talking about those lines on Appleton‘s back 8:20
12:55 "Paahk the Caah!!"
Honestly i would like to try ho ohs and moltres meat
I would NOT eat any of the regis though 😭 they're my favorite characters, and most of them will just HURT to eat regirock? my teeth will fall out regice? I'd freeze registeel? same as regirock regieleki? 10 sets of electrocution regidrago? I mean, it's body does look like a fruit but hell no that things probably rock solid  REGIGIGAS?? some people say normal type Pokémon are litterally just flesh, but that things a body of ROCK, a body of STEEL, and a body of ICE. I would freeze + my teeth would fall out
This video may have been made before oinkologne, but that is the most normal pig
We never see people actually eat food that much in the Pokemon universe and I wonder how they survive with this limited amount of food because all I see ash eating is pokepuffs
Oh. So That's Where The Origin Of Pokemon Pumpkin
And then, on October 23, 2022, Unfeasant was considered extinct because of human consumption.
Petalittle tea is just coffee but better
I’m working on a Pokémon trainer oc whose parents own a restaurant and you have NO IDEA how helpful tbis is for studying Pokémon culinary and stuff as well as coming up with ideas for what dishes this resturaunt will serve!
id eat vanillite and all its evolutions as well as fidough
10:17 😂
Mikey is making poke dad jokes
Watching suffering is minor Mikey u need help
1:15 saving money is key 😅
What about ice cream Pokémon
13:05 for shame
00:19 bro that mean that people could eat there hubby ain’t that wrong
What about vanillite
This is probably a Pokémon legends acreus survival guide
Who wants to eat farfetch'ds green onion that its holdin
You don't like lamb? Bruv make skewers and sprinkle them with cumin and red pepper you philistine. Oh and don't overcook them
How dare you eat piloswine
what about oingkologne
Bruh I wanted unpeasint to be in scarlet because I wanted to use it on a playthrough team
where is tatsugiri
Do I see squirtle and bulbasaur from Pokémon talk in the background?
finally clicked the link for the raycons.  the ones they link for your code, arent the ones Grunty Boy advertises.  cant even find these in the video
Jd have Tauros or Buffolant burgers with cheese. I bet baked goods with Tropius fruit would be tasty.
Real late to this but I’d add some of the bug Pokemon to this list. After all both them and crustaceans are arthropods, it’s just that normally they’re too small to get the meat out without having to eat the bug whole. Meanwhile the world of Pokemon is filled to the brim with giant bugs more than big enough to properly butcher, for example I imagine a cooked skorupi tail would compare to a lobster tail as long as you removed any venom glands and a plate of steamed ariados legs could be a nice crab leg substitute
Isn’t shukle the mold Pokémon
Can't eat miltank. It's a dairy cow not a beef cow. Dairy cow meat is not FDA approved for consumption due to its meat quality being "poor". You would be able to get it outside of the states but not with in. You'd be eating Torous. Higher quality with potentially beautiful marbling,  since it's based on a beef bull and not a dairy cow.
This was not the first thing that crossed my mind when I though what would I see on my recommended page😭
what about the vanilluxe line? Ice cream? ^^
noooooo not pear
Ya, about the hole eating Pokemon thing, the only time people on the show talk about that was the first season of the anime. The only thing close to that after words is the food that the Pokemon create ( with out death and) through stuff like it falls off of them or they make it through stuff like milking or whatever shucle does
I am just saying, where on earth is Magikarp
Klaf shells
What did he say 2:00
tangelas noodle things
They could be eating shed skin
2:56 but what about oinkolong
magikarp sushi, tatsugiri
0:19 Hey, did you know-
morning: breakfestburito with miltank meat and a miltank milkshake noon: pancake's made from miltank's milk evening: A miltank steak with mushroom sause (contains miltank milk) and for desert ice cream of choise (now guess from witch milk the ice is made of)
3:41 ~ 4:06 favorite part of the video
Most american thing ive heard today. "If theyre almost extinct, they gotta be good right..........im having me some"😂
9:56 you a Starbucks girly (only in the autumn)
Hey, I like unfesent
Hey, I like unfesent
9:50 pumpkin makes me sick but i LOVEEEE pumpkin
as long as you don't eat the full bouwnsweet i'm fine (my favorite pokemon are the bouwnsweet line)
2:19 so its wine? sure ill have some
I would honestly eat a rayquaza
I've been attacked by Veluza too many times, but y'know what, HOW THE TURN TABLES-
Grilled Gabite sounds astounding
I do Not Need the egg I am all of them
To be fair, Pokemon Had and ALWAYS have the chance to eat a Human.
2:01 this sounds pleasant out of context
Pokemon are like animals in the real world, right?
Me:chuging up some milktank cireal and eating milktank burger Bro:were is my milktank!!??!!??
Ngl I have a pumpkin chili recipe made with spicy Italian sausage and canned pumpkin filling and beans and oh my! My husband and I eat it during fall and winter! :)
Pumpkin mashed potatoes exists.                        Why
Wortoal scriptures to small and blastoise has cannons
This needs a update with veluza and toedscruel and such
You lost me at the buffalo and ranch. Just bbq that combusken
I thought grass was purple?
god
1:17 th- th that se-that seems
Delicious in dungeon be like:
I would be interested in trying a milotic  meat
Where is Gardevoir and Lopunny?
Wait, isn't Combusken's body like, DANGEROUSLY hot?
9:06 “I’ll drink Tsareena’s sweat” Someone said that at the bottom of the comment section
I love bug meat guts legs head eyes and Durant is 1 foot long but somehow 72 pounds sign me up. Also what if an applin infected a pumpkin it would be easier than removing the ghost.
I thought it was pee
Thought: Maybe the skin on Appletons back is technically dead skin, like how when humans have dead skin and it peels off it’s still technically skin, so maybe the cooked apple on it’s back is like dead skin that harmlessly peels off and taste like apple pie, it just eventually regrows and piles up again and either falls off or is eaten, heck maybe it feels good for the Appleton like releasing pressure on it’s back
bonsweet sweat prob goes good in coffee
It's pronounced ChOW-DAHHHR.
Pumpkin soup with diced salted potato and a grilled cheese is actually pretty nice.
shuckle juice is wine.
In the first anime to not have ash it’s a juise brand
14:44 don’t eat the alcremie just let it give you infinite cream
You forgot ho oh hes basically fried chicken
Snorelax
So are we just going to forget that grunty boy being Harry Potter then
I wonder what unknown taste like...
Weirdest video on this channel
Hahaha😂😂
Isn't piloswine just fur and fat?
As a Bostonian, you hurt my soul with your Bostonian accent.
4:00 i recommend miltank milk,it is just like chansey's eggs explictly stated to be super delicious and healthy
Dude😂 the vegan teachers going crazy right now
What about Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe?
Uhhh isn’t their a sushi Pokemon or am I crazy
Vanilite,Vanilish and Vanilluxe
Mikey doing his best Charles Darwin impression: Eats the thing he is researching 😂
9:57 In my homeland of South Africa pumpkin fritters are very popular among Afrikaans people, so I can see a region based on South Africa making Pumpkiboo fritters
Hear me out. nacli  (specifically nacli ice cream)
Gory teams for events
Pumpkin water or pumpkin cherries
Ppl eat gator and turtle down here in the south, so I’d be willing to try krookodile/krokorok (ik they’re crocodiles but close enough) and torterra or blastoise.
just saying you eat klawf in S&V
i would eat whitneys miltank specifically. once she retires it, im not a monster, but oh my god i hate her goddamn miltank
7:40 i'm pretty sure lemon works as a natural bug repellant too so it's not that uncommon
make a video again,but now featuring the whole gen 9 dex
Could eat squirtle water tortoise or blast?Oysterturtle meat turtle shells dew is a delicacy not to mention turtle.Leg sup your turtles are edible and they're good
3:20 ill eat bambis mom though lol
...bro forgot the sentient ice cream...
Ok id try a few Foods from the anime wich is moomoo milk and the homade ice cream from the sun and moon anime
13:08 There’s a joke in here somewhere…
Noooooooo Milltank don't eat him please please please!!
What if you find some pretty good leftovers in garbodor
Royal pear collab
This video is sponsored by Vegans Nightmare
Oh I didn't know that Pumpkin is so wildly consummed in sweet recipe ! In France, we more likely tend to eat all kind of pumpkins like vegetables in gratin, stuffed with meat, steamed ect.
Why not swana or octiliry  swana looks pretty good
Send this to that vegan teacher
Vanilla pokemon
2:22 that was my childhood dream to eat berries from the pokemon world
one thing i wil be saying grunty boi is a multiversal threat now its a good thing he is stuck with mikey or we wont just see miltanks demise we will see everyones demise
wait its m and j tv, not mand j. tv?? (or mand JTV)
7:32 Halfway point
appeltun skin i thing will count as pastry
U forgot alcrarmy
Should've added Bulbasaur, thats meat and veg, similar to Farfetch'd
As a native to Maryland, I would DESTROY a Klawf. You got the klawf sticks, the built in organic seasoning, it would be delicious. I would also mess up a Spicy Combusken Chicken Sandwich.
He forgot to say the ice cream cone pokemon
You didn't mention the frogs or frog legs.  Like Polytoad.  And Phantump has a dex entry with states its leaves can be used in a tea.  If you ask nicely.  Speaking of tea, there are the tea ghost types.
Imagine marrying food.
How about Dynamax or Gigantamax Alcremie
You don’t even need to eat alcreamie because they make wipped cream
Maybe peta came along and was like “Frick you” and did a little superhero action and got physical and did a lil damage  and then they stopped
Bellsprout ‘s leaves  ( as a Indian I will add leaves on anything )
“I won’t eat Bambi but I will eat his mom” got me DYING 😂😂😂
“Am I doing the Boston accent right? Bak da cah?… clam choughda?” Why was that funny
7:47 ROYAL PE-
mikey you missed something bulbasour bc of its back or back pack
6:15 well then ur eating l l l l lava ch ch ch ch chicken Steve’s lava chicken ya
6:32 Hi, butcher here. Pheasant is great for beginners to Game Meats (meat from animals you'd have to actively go out and hunt for, like Venison.) It's mildly gamey with a pleasant flavor, and its one of the few poultries you can leave just a little bit pink in the centre.
Ok thank goodness my favorite unova pokemon is tynamo but alcremie just ask it for cream T-T
DO! NOT! EAT! THE FOOD POKEMON! Piratesoftware pointed something out that makes TOO MUCH SENSE! The only time, in nature, something deliberately looks like food, it's because it's a parasite. Those Pokemon are parasites! And, judging by their size, you won't be a host for long. You will be a desiccated pile of bones and inedible organs within a week.
Vanilite
nom nom
Why aren’t you eating oinkeleen
I would eat febass
7:09 I’ve had kangaroo meat once and loved it, I’ve never had it in the ten years since… I have been waiting for the day I taste it again 🤤
Vaporeon😐
U forgot the vanilite line
Capsakid's teeth are used as flavoring, according to the Violet Dex.  And I do like me some spicy BBQ sauce. I came here to mention Veluza, but that was already noted. Nacli is also known to provide salt.
This is the greatest Pokemon-themed video of all time. Bar none.
i'd love to taste gyrados it looks amazing and prob very tasty
If I had the option to eat a Pokemon, I'm going straight for the dragon meat. Pokemon are fantastical creatures, I'd want a culinary experience that isn't anything like real-world animals.
3:21 is so out of context
Too chicken jockey 6:15
Any Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet come to mind here?
God dam idiot grass is green 😂
Fun Fact: When you trade a pokemon for shuckle in heartgold and soulsiver the shuckle will have berry juice item with it
I have a favorite! Sliced scovillian heads on oinkologne pepperoni pizza!
i think petilil's leaves are based on neem (Azadirachta indica) which are used in india for medicinal purposes and for storing grains because it repels bugs.
Grunty boi needs his own channel for his playthroughs
0:17 poor magikarp...he is just a carp...
2:54 Isn't piloswine and mamoswine a mammoth? i mean it's MAMOswine
4:05 why is Whitney so hard
If the berries are fermented inside the Shuckle’s shell, does that mean Berry Juice is canonically alcoholic? Pretty sure you would get drunk if you had a lot of that.
I am actually doing a challenge in violet where I can only use edible animal based Pokémon, with the exception of Nacli to salt the meat and iron bundle to keep it frozen
i see that austin shirt....
This was a funny video
"But I'll eat it's mom though" is the most random and creepiest thing I've ever heard
So you wouldn't eat the ice cream Pokemon
In Pokémon horizons you can see that shuckle can pour juice with one of its holes
Pidgeotto?
No not bambi mom
What about oinkoloine
I like the new thumbnail! very cool art
muk backwards?
Balls on its head is WILD
Vanillite
In episode on diamond and pearl " the lonely snover" there was scene where snover gave Ash and others his ice "berries" even tho it looked more of compresed snow ball. From how it tasted they said it's sweet and cool, so basically small wannabe icecream. in same episode we saw that Ash's Grotle strats growing acorns on his back bushes as sign it's accepting it's own evolution. From what we saw, it's taste is different as Ash didn't like it but pikachu did. so Grotle's acorns can be source of food for pokemon.
And a drink on the side
Hear me out,what if you made a meat skewer with a bunch of different kinds of Pokémon
I love pumpkin pie too😊
Garss is not blue is red
Nall bro that juice comes from somewhere else that Pokedex is lying
Of course you'd eat Miltank. I like Miltank.(not eating it)
This guy forgot Oinkologne
May i introduce: Roserade Tea?
Bro militant is a jack of all trades! It has steak, sausage, and milk. Need I say less?
I mean I could go for a chocolate flavored Milcery right now
14:48  fried caterpie
Electros is a lampray, not an eel, just so you know
Imagine John/PM7 commented “HOW DARE YOU EAT PILOSWINE THEN THERE WOULD BE LESS MAMOSWINE”
I would eat Mr. mime 🤤
Fun fact: there is indeed a plant that does have bitter leaves and is indeed used as a remedy for fatigue by chewing on the leaves or as an infussion like tea.... also the same plant is processed to extract the alcaloid compound and used for medical purposes or sold illegally as a white powder.
We all new miltank would be in this video personally I love steak and milk so miltank is an easy choice
Get me a ground miltank slider right now yummmmmmmmmmm
Or a kangaroo
i bet magmotar  would be delicious
Do you like the sound of pumpkin cheese?
Hopefully eating bat Pokémon doesn't spread diseases like in the real world...
"Pumpkin spiced everything". Mikey just admitted to being a basic white girl.
This video isn't as weird as you think it is. In the anime it is shown that plenty of these pokemon most notably shuckle and Alcremie, regularly provide food as part of their not weird lives. Shuckle regularly makes juice and pours it into glasses for the pokemon and human crew of the Volt Tacklers in Horizon, and Alcremie is partnered with bakers and helps cooks by using its creams to decorate cakes, with its flavor varying with the type of Alcremie.  There's one plot point where a single Alcremie was owned by two bakers who went their separate ways, but Alcremie helped them get back together and go back into business together.
Shuckles explicitly makes juice for the crew in Pokemon Horizons.. its not weird at all.
Don't drink to much Miltank milk,or your body would turn into one of a Miltanks
2:34 What about Oinkologne?
Bacon (spoiler) Oinkaloink
I’m not gonna be surprised if he does a “if it faints, I make and eat it”
1:19 explains why it’s so rare to find one in gen 1
humans. the're a pokemon, right?
MICHEAL KILLED BAMBIS MOM! EVERYONE, GET HIM!!!
All the *RABBIT* Pokemon!  Love me some fresh rabbit meat, both me and my snakes  😋
/Slacking
What about vaniluxe and the evolution its just... ice cream
Hoot hoot
Magıkarp the god of the sea😂😂😂
I think Hariyama might be good to try
Gourgeist and pumpkaboo: Singing joyfully while they send their victum to the underworld mikey: Tottally normal things
Miltank sausages sound great
What about Odish?
'I'll eat his mom though' - MIchael
Vanillite its litterely ice cream
And that’s what they said about mercury 7:46
If you use the captions it says grand tip boy 🤣🤣😂😂
Farfetch'd being hunted to near extinction doesn't mean its good to eat. It may be, but historically the animals we eat the most aren't about them tasting the best, but rather their size, and ease of capture and herding. Cows and chickens. There's better meats, but these are really easy and still taste good.
I should eat a kingler
mikey going out of his way to extinguish the miltank race by eating every single organism alive:
You know if i was in the pokemon world i would actually eat the berries we know the berries are actually good remember shackle berry juice and they also heal injuries also if i get access to one leftover that's enough food for my whole lifetime
3:24  Bison burgers are, indeed, very delicious!
THE ALL IN ONE-BREAKFAST Grumpig Bacon Chansey Eggs Miltank Sausage Pumpkaboo Pancakes Reply if I missed anything

I miss the day😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I would love to have some Combuskin Nuggets
My peak breakfast would be milktank tacos and burgers with cheese made from moomoo milk, and arrokuda
I feel like I would eat wooloo because I love goat meat.
New thumbnail?
(edit in read more, make sure to press that before you tell me I was incorrect about when this was posted) Also, in terms of pig Pokemon that would probably make good bacon... Gen 9's basic Normal type, Lechonk and it's evolution Oinkologne, would probably be pretty good too. And yes, I do know this video was released before SV released.  Edit: I was rewatching this and forgot he had already mentioned Lechonk. Let it be known I disagree, Lechonk and Oinkologne would probably make some pretty good bacon, even if Lechonk wouldn't provide much
i would eat a legendary pokemon. probably a dragon or bird one.  I would probably go to hell for it but id do it
2:36  And now we have Oinkologne. Quite edible, really.
When he said “if they hunted it so much it’s gotta be good” he explained the entirety of dodo extinction
Alligator is really good. So, yeah anything feralligatr.
Speaking as a man who has once tasted a stew made with bobcat meat, I'd be willing to find out how Luxray compares.
Michael is one of the few people I don't skip the sponsored sections for, almost entirely because of Grunty Boi
I would eat drozee I hate it
I love how Mikey is the biggest miltank hater
Pumpkin juice, Pumpkin sauce,Pumpkin beef and Pumpkin cheese 9:54
Good to watch this and the 7 year old version
No escargot? Yes its nasty to some but snail pokemon (like the goomy line) could be put here?
Don't let the vegan teacher see this😂😂😂
Mikey: "Grumpig and Piloswine are the only choices."  Oinkologne: *Am I a joke to you?*
You’re pronouncing the Devolution of alcrame wrong watch the last season of Pokémon
It’s been two years since this video was released😃(wtf)
I’m vegan but I’ll eat some of these pokemon like alcreamies cream
Are you the one that killed Bambi’s mom?😂
im back and now im thinking of it dipplin would be amazing
I will gladly devour Miltank, considering they're everywhere and have a lot of body surface for meat cutting. Miltank burger and MooMoo milk would taste amazing.
Bro nacli is described as having delightful salt crank it on militant with pepper and that’s a salt as miltank
If got a kfc commercial for spicy chicken just after you said combuskan is on fire😂😂
I’d prob eat Tatsugiri
I would try Oinkologne bacon if it was kosher.
Although I’m not sure if this is even canon due to it being in a dream sequence and the sun and moon anime gorgeist are seen turning into pumpkins after being defeated
2:15 “The berries eventually ferment” MY GUY IT LITERALLY SAYS *”The berries mix with its body fluids to become delicious juices”!!!*
I hate miltank
Did you forget that there is a lireral ice cream pokemon
Exeggcute and Exeggutor could provide nutrition 🤔
vanilux is just ice cream
i wanna mention veluza since it's fish fillets are mentioned tasty and i can get revenge for it being a chasing asshole in casseroya lake . dachsbun it's tasty cooked dough
Technically Lapras could also be an edible Pokemon, as the many whale hunters who brought its numbers down must've done so because it tasted delicious. Now that it's become overpopulous and no longer endangered it may not be such a moral conundrum to want to try some Lapras sashimi?
Sinischa and polchageist. The tea has healing properties. Not sinistea or polteageist tho. (Watch the horizons anime!)
vanillite?
But the question is could you live with killing one of those cute pokemon?
I'd eat Loppuny, but not as good 😏
What about oddish
noooo not cha cha kitty pumpkin😢
Pikachuuuuuuuuuuuüuu😊
Shuckle's berries would most likely be a cider, not a wine.
If we eating Miltank,  I'm eating Whitney's one
I love eating other pokémon.... just not any eeveelution
bulbasors bulb
id eat sunflora. roasted sunflower heads are delish
What about the vanillite family?
We eat dog and chickens.   Same same 😅
"I'm not eating bamby... I'll eat his mom tho" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THEY MARRIED PEOPLE?
me out here eating fidough and dachsbun
Fidough and Dachsbun. They’re just bread in the shape of dogs.
12:53 "Am I doing the Boston accent right?" Me, a Massachusetts person: No, you are offending my people. Don't worry, the fried calamari thing instantly redeems.
Since you're on the topic of food and I saw you talk about a soup-and-fish type Bookman. I'm just gonna say it. The ocean is a soup. Just think about it and then come back with that. Yeah, now you get it.
What about scovillain and capsakid. Assuming that they don’t go on a fiery, murderous rampage similar to that of their dex enteries
What website do you use
Good thing you didn’t choose to eat Magikarp. Carp are trash fish and not safe for consumption.
Also i absolutly love Azurill (sorry Azurill) but its tail is packed full of nutrients... But the head thing might not be too edible... (Sorry Azurill).
Piloswine will tell PM7
john will be so mad
I think you could eat Bulbasaur bulb. It looks like a cabbage.
9:56 all right I’ll name something for pumpkin pumpkin uranium 252
Magakarp
I'm surprised he didn't mention tatsugiri
Thanks for the legends arceus guide!
Tatsugiri!!!
Mikey show this video to that vegan teacher and watch her reaction
7:48 We be eating Royal Pear with this one
The idea of eating farfetch is really mouthwatering (I love duck) . I would also probably eat any water pokemon except suicune (yeah, yeah yeah, I'm a specist, I know XD) and anything spicy sadly (but not charmander and vulpix. That I can't) and any grass pokemon except sprigattito. There, I said it... also any pokemon that makes tea, I'd drink it. Chansey eggs, milk and cheese from gogoat, also look delicious ! Obviously though I would avoid any pokemon that is said to have a nasty taste XD
LET THE MAN FEAST  Edit: give me chansey eggs now
When you said I won’t eat Bambi but I’ll eat his mom my dog left the room quickly 😂
Why is GB (Grunty Boi) wearing them he's not actually gaming 4:14
Mikey did you know gaston was the guy who killed bambi's mom
2:02 Excuse me… What?!
So your saying chansey could cure cancer
Yoooo Royal pair
vanilait!
A Tauros steak would hit the spot  Or an Oinkologne porkchop
I like that you said you want to kill milk  tank
majicrp
majocarp
Hahaha just out of spite he would eat Miltank all the time😂 3:44
I totally would eat some Magikarp.
im pretty sure shinottic would be comparable to psychedelic mushrooms, you know, magic shrooms. Since its a grass/fairy type.
So there's a possibility that a situation like this would occur in the pokemon world  Someone: aw man, I'm thirsty but there's nothing to drink  Someone: *realises* *slowly looks at milkery*  Milkery: *backs away*
I get why he said pumpkaboo pumpkin pie stuff is amasing
I wouldn't eat Magikarp since its based on koi fish and they aren't fit for human consumption and I like Gyrados. Pretty much any pokemon that I hate and is based on an animal that people eat, I will eat. Especially Kwalf because I hate its lame design and I love crabs.
Put gruntty boy in white already
Not Shellder and Clamperl! Like if you felt bad for them.
MAMOSWINE AIN'T A PIG HE'S HE'S A MAMMOTH ITS IN THE NAME MAND
Aussie here,  at 7:09 kangaroo meat is very difficult to prepare as it loses about 70-90% of the moisture whislt cooking therefore whenever we prepeare it for something other than Kangaroo Jerky we add gravy or othersemi liquids to add moisture to it, But Kangaroo is a very Lean meat and is best eaten with Herbs and spices and If possible australian Yams go great with it
Tatsugiri
Even if miltank can infinitely produce milk, it can still suffer, milk producers WILL BECOME RICH
Smoliw
Trubbish and garbodor are yummy 🤤
10000000000000 Milktank burgers for me
Torchic could make some great chicken nuggets unless if you could handle its stomach which is like 1800 degrees
There's a pokedex entry for miltank that when you drink enough milk you will become miltank
pumpkin soup
You missed Vanilite and the line
I would suggest polteageist, Dhelmise sea weed, basculegion meat and fried Skeledige
0:19 I just think that's cute
Vanilluxe: *phew*
You should include bulbasour vines
you forgot magickarp
Just asking, are you willing to eat a Xerneas?
I just found you today and THIS video has earned you a sub. XD
Once, I read a fic about how there were some Pokémon raised for food purposes. I can’t remember the name of it, unfortunately, but I remember it had James keeping the Magikarp he got from the scammer on the St. Anne, and Meowth calling Magikarp a “foodie”, if I recall the term right? That’s where it got talked about, Pokémon raised for food purposes.   Ngl, I’d totally love a Milktank steak with a side of mashed potatoes made with moo moo milk.
Where’s the ice cream pokemon
What about Alomomola?
lechonk literally has chonk in the name there's gotta be a ton of meat there
being vegan in the pokemon world sounds like choosing the hardest difficulty at the start of a game
I love that if grunty boy leaves mikey just goes further without saying anything.
2:42 Evolve lechonk…………. 😋😋😋
if the pumpkin Pokémon is inside a pumpkin that means there are pumpkin’s in this world so why eat it
I never knew this 1:57
Bro you missed magikarp
"Ill eat its mom tho" 💀
Is it just me or is mandjtv the only YouTuber who doesn’t slow down their vids
Phesent is basically a chiken, they're really good too.
I thought you hated Miltank LOL 3:42
What about Lechonks evolved form though? but that being said I would assume that it’s meat would be really heavily perfumed to the point of being inedible but I’m not 100% sure
Vanilish?
NO NOT KLAWF!!!!!!!!!!!!!😥
For Appleton I think the 'skin' is probably the pastry strips on its back
9:55  "Bro you wanna have some pumpkin dog treats"
Why not Oinkolonge?
Im surprised you didn't mention chekorita it sounds delicious 😋
Ngl I would eat toedscruel/toedscool or octilleriy cause I LOVE calamari
Looking at Camerupt, I get that “camel” is implied in his name, but he is absolutely a cow. Even then, camel burgers are still a thing.   What I’m saying is, jalapeño Camerupt burger with pepper jack cheese.
In the starter squad seires, THE CATERPIES FEAST ON BULBASAURS BULB! It is tasty and nutritious
The fish pokemon
You missed the legendary bird trio and the lamb Pokémon/goat Pokémon
I wonder if it would still be vegetarian to eat smoliv. like, of course it’s a living being that has emotions. but then also it’s a plant. maybe it’s similar to how some view fish??
is thhere a reason he didnt pick magikarp?
Feel like Alcremie on Pumpkaboo pie would maybe disenchant the curse that may be on the pumpkin since it's Fairy type
Sunkern- is it Corn or Sunflower seeds? Either way, yum!
I know this was before dlc but I would absolutely devour a dipplin
Delibird: Not sure what penguin tastes like but it won't be missed. Vanilluxe: Enough said. Qwilfish: Sure it's a Poison type but I know parts of it are not because people do eat pufferfish.
I would enjoy a good cup of bounsweut❤ tea. ❤😂🎉🎉😢😮😅
Bro's going to get attacked by the vegan activists
Native people did eat dogs of corce i would not eat boltund but whatever
The Vanilluxe Line lucked out with this one.
Valitine
I enjoy your videos, and I enjoy that you have a duel role as Grunty Boy
scolvillian?????
is mikey ok
grunty boy your right grass is blue
Would Shinotic line just count as psychedelics?
There’s a literal sushi
Pumpkin spice apple cider
I would eat bombirdiers stones
I actually realy wanted to see tatsugiri in this video for som reason lol.
5:25 Yes it is.
U mist onikolone
can I eat pumkaboo pie with milkcreme creme on it?
Im surprised because Farfetch'd is the only one you considered duck. But duck is so freakin good. Also, big fan of pumpkin seeds if salted well.
I feel like this is weird but I would kinda want to try some dragon Pokémon like haxorus and Charizard to see what it tastes like
9:47 Not a  TIL cuz I've watched this at least once before. So, today, I remembered that Mikey is a Basic Bish
3:24 wtf
I love Pheasant! I’m actually hunting them right now! I could cook you some Mikey!
Magic grunty boi
3:22
😂😂😂🫥🫥🫥🫥
9:05
Charizard
What about squirtle I feel like it would be really juicy and plus you got a drink and some meat!Also turtles are just good in general
"I'll eat his mom tho...." 🌚
3:42 - 4:05 Mikey, my dude, AMEN! THAT DEMON COW CAN PERISH
you didnt want to mention the ice cream pokemon?!
Good you didn't said Oddish, but Oddish soup could be good
WHY DO I WANT TO EAT A GYRADOS
I’m sorry SHUCKLE’S JUICE?!- WHAT- (you would WHAT TO A MILTANK?! My guy listen imagine it was a DUDE. THAT WOULDNT BE MILK ANYMORE.)
If I had to eat a Pokemon Arceus.
Pokemon of pets it's like eating your dog it's sad is there a monsters what's wrong with them why are they crazy what's wrong with them who eats their own creatures of friendship 😭😔
Well, obviosly appletun’s back is eatable, is a literal apple pie
I would eat any grass tüpe that iş not poisionıus
There would be pokemon that could produce food within just a second. Alcreamie in anima producing whipped cream,  and Slowpoke's tail being cut off painlessly.
YOU WOULD EAT THEM?????? YOU MONSTER
i would eat regice
Vanelite
I think Dachsbun would be a great choice
No! Not shelder, i love him
Honestly if i was in the pokemon world, id probably be vegan, lmao
How do you kill a milcery to eat it it's liquid
the doughnut dogs
A Oinkelone subway sounds delicious right about now.
Some pokelunch1. .    1.  Curry ( farfetch meat , leak , potatoes, carrots, curry leaves and big root. 2. Pumpkin pie ( pumbkaboo).  3. Vanilite icecream 4. Petilil tea ( with honey and moomoo milk.
Pokémon saved since Gen 9 wasn’t out yet: Quaxwell (duck) Quaquaval (duck) Oinkologne (pig) Nacli (salt) Naclstack (salt) Garganacl (salt) Dipplin (candy apple) Hydrapple (candy apple) Paldean Tauros (bull) Tatsugiri (sushi) Dachsbun (bun) Smoliv (olive, could’ve shown up) Dolliv (olive) Arboliva (olive) Toedscool (mushroom) Toedscruel (mushroom) Brute Bonnet (mushroom) Fezandipiti (pheasant, albeit Poison type)
6:13 nah its a nugget
I’m not done with the video but I hope Alcreme is in this video, happy gigantimax Alcreme Specifically!
"im not gonna eat Bambi......i'll eat his mom though."  this could VERY EASILY be taken out of context LMAO
Appleton can regenerate
😂 I'd eat Milktank everyday too.. its gotta go
That image of a cyndaquil drinking from miltanks utters is a picture that wont ever leave my head
5:37 WOW
3:46           WOW
Bad news for vegan people💀
Grunty Boi not remembering what grass is like is just  hilarious.😂
Marrying a pokemon..... 🤔, Um excuse me is a hybrid ok in the pokemon world? 😀
I will eat Charmander and don't forget some Bulbasaur and another one but this time is was Squirtle that was the only thing that I will eat Charmander was just a meat because we can eat their tail and Squirtle was just a delicacy of a turtle meat and Bulbasaur was just a piece of broccoli and some salad
I want another one of these
This feels like a dungeon meshi episode
How have I never seen this video before?!
7:45 “People do it so it must be safe” Mikey 2022. 2018 YouTubers doing a specific challenge.
Honestly, I would eat beedrill
Another delicious pig would be oinkologne.
You forgot onkilone
Pause at 0:19
You had the BDSP entry on screen but ended up reading the Black and White entry instead
"I like mushrooms"-Mikey 2022
And Scoville is just peppers 🌶️ but just remove the fire 🔥 from there mouths
Magikarp left the team sky future chat.
ok Michael what is going on?
What about bombirdier or donzozo? 14:43
make team rocket eat a chancey egg and oh I made a comment 4 months ago appletun would be good though
3:48 Actually, Miltank can be found in the wild on Route 39, just outside of Olivine City, and there's even a Miltank farm there. Olivine City is based on the Japanese city of Kobe, where Kobe beef comes from. So Miltank's meat probably _would_ be similar to wagyu beef, as they come from a similar geographical area.
A5 wagyu miltank seems yummy
3:51 Miltank :why do you hate me MandJTV: cause you are so FREAKING Hard to beat Miltank :Skill issue
Pumpkin poop
Pokemon marrying people isn't so surprising today 😂
I would eat Pincurchin so long as the meat no longer has electricity in it. Uni is very popular especially with sushi.  Arboliva shares it’s nutritious olive oil with people so I would imagine there would be tons of dishes that would work with  I haven’t tried Frog Legs before but I heard from people that have tried it saying it tastes like chicken. The best choice for me would be Politoed.
9:04 AYO!!!
What about magickarp and Vanilluxe?
11:46 klawth is a rock
I am pure vegetarian
What about Oinkalogne.It's just like grumpig and piloswines meat except a little more fatty.
Alcreamies gigantamax would be bussin
You missed magikarp lol
Me personally would love to try a piece of appletun's skin on it's back with a vanillite. I know it sounds brutal to just eat a vanillite it is ice cream
bro imagine bounsweet sweat, tropius fruit, cherubi fruit, snover fruit and a very small amount of miltank milk in a smoothie
Royalpair is edable
Le-chonk evolves
pumkin pizza
pedalil tea with bound sweet sweat
no grass is yellow
Do NOT eat the fairy types. We all know that eating fae food is guaranteed to harm you in some way.
Finally he gets revenge on miltank
dont forget skwovet
I want to eat alcremie
You forgot fidough
Personally, I could go for either a Vanillite, Vanillish, or Vanilluxe sundae!
Exorcise the pumpkins!
shuckls juice💀
Megicarp would also be a cool meal
Toshugrye know those sushi dragon Pokémon the little sushi Pokémon sorry I like sushi
Pumpkin pancakes
Grunty boy you need to go outside or you’re not mentally OK 5:23
MandJTV Is Hell
I Hate MandJTV Hate And Eat Milktank
Sunflora seeds?
Im staying this as a 🚬  Grunty boy is more gay-coded than RuPaul He doesn’t just know Dorothy, Dorothy is his drag persona.
LAPRAS!!!!!!!!
5:27 Yes, and it sounds amazing
3:41 imagine this out of context
I love the fact that people are supprised people eat pokemon, immagine them saying “OH MY GOD PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE EAT COWS!!!
To add on to the alcreme part in the anime(horizons) it literally gives it’s cream to the cook
Snorlax it’s big and probably has a lot of thick juicy meat on it
Pumpkin Spice lattes are godly
"What better pokemon to eat" "...besides milktank"
the grunty boi segment is wild "although i cant seem to remember what grass is like. its blue right?"
Scovillan and capsikid’s teeth sound good. (It says they naturally fall out and are a traditional paldean spice(Scarlet and violet))
Lechonk bacon sounds good
2:40 did you forget about oknkilonge? (sorry spelt it wrong how do you pronounce this one)
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN       MAGIKARP MEEEEAAAAAATTTTT I mean, remember that episode of the anime where Ash and the gang along with Jessie and James thought of eating the magikarp James bought from a random shopkeeper in the SS. Anne.
i would eat primeape
These help me talk to customers in McDonald's  So now I can make money
The galarian delicacy Gmax alcremie
Bro really gonna skip a chance to try literal dragon meat.
No ice cream Pokemon?
According to the newest handbook for Crabominable The detached pincers are delicious and some trainers bring Lechonk into the mountains just to search for them.
What about Oinkologne?🐖🥓
With the pure amount of berries in the pokemon world, I'm sure I'd definitely be a vegan in the pokemon world too.
Graploct, I like octopus
Nah I’d eat ducklett, that one is fat and chunky, haha.   Oh don’t let the bug repellent feature of Petlil worry you. Bug repellent plants being edible is not unusual. Often the best herbs have bug repellent and herbal tea benefits. Rosemary repels mosquitoes  Lavender also repels mosquitos Mint repels flies and ants.  Lemongrass repels mosquitos as well.
12:50  Bomb and Boston Jn the Same Sentence Is Crazy, Mikey Didn’t realize what he said
Wait grass is blue right?
How`bout Togepi😋
I support all of these except Alcremie.  Don't eat my cute frosting gals
vanillish
I know I'm waaay late, but Toadscruel skin is edible according to its pokedex entry and I think it would fit in the murshroom category.
NUM NUM
charizard tasty:)
In that case id eat Salazzle Loppuny and Gardevoir, batman 😩👌🏼🔥
If they're possessed pumpkins, doesn't that imply that there would be pumpkins that aren't possessed that you could eat without doing a ritual
Lechonk too young? Lechonk would be delicious! Very tender pork meat...  Roast it over an open flame and season it and you'll be having...  Lechonk de Leche (Small Pig Roast) 🤣
I mean, farfetch'd is literally based off of a saying about a duck arriving with exactly what you need to cook it, so…
Oddish, my least favorite Pokémon(it’s because in this one game I play oddish is literally almost impossible unless you’ve been playing for your whole life for some radish Pokémon) I would love to eat for the same reason for militank.
something about miltank to note is that miltank's milk if drunk too much turns you into miltank
Kangaroo is ok. A popular way to cook it is kangaroo tails slowly stewed. Just like slowpoke 😂
What about tastugiri
Hey, it’s like those natural bug repellent. You know those some plant bug repellent that you can able to eat yeah that does like this. Well it’s DIY.
Lord i'd eat a Golem bet its rocks are tasty
Fun fact: You probably won't want to eat Pumpkaboo, because most "pumpkin" products don't actually contain real pumpkin; it apparently tastes pretty bad, so they use other squashes instead.
Charmander blood=hot sauce Fried magikarp Fried dodrio
You would probably enjoy Miltank's milk even less if, like in the real world, Miltank had to first procreate in order to provide milk.
14:46 Vanillice and its evolution line It’s just ice cream
I’m sorry but now I’m in subbing slow poke tails, so bye never watching the video game
You suck
Royalpear: uhhh… i dont think you can eat me… mikey: *prepares knife and fork*
Were veluza
This make me so hungry
You missed Woolo and dubwoul
As soon as he said pumpki I was like I'll switch my every meal w something pumpkin flavored and I'll be happier than ever.
I'm not gonna eat Bambi. .... I'll eat his mom though.
Is anyone put off by the fact he called Radagon Ragadon?
where the hell magicarp, the og pokemon cuisine.
Those pumpkins are probably rotten!
What is a seed, if not a plant egg.
Grunty boy is right. Grass is blue
The vegans are fuming after this video
Okay, it seems there is one you REALLY missed. Sorry for the 1 year delay xD Magikarp. Let's be honest, it's one of the few we have visual confirmation of being eaten, so... It must be good, or at least plentyful and not bad.
3:24 " I'll eat his mom though " 💀💀
"I not only get to enjoy [Miltank's] flavor, but also its demise!" Mikey is a D1 Hater.
He: I Eat His Mom
I’ve had squab before (pigeon/pheasant meat). It’s alright.
i would be down for some fried malamari as well. i also would enjoy milktanks demise
I know this video is over a year old but I was re-watching it and was hit with a thought about piloswine bacon. In real life highland cattle is quite lean meat because they keep themselves warm with their long coat instead of with body fat like other cows do, so I would assume piloswine is very lean meat also.
10:18 thats just a hard way eat a pumpkin, at that point i rather i eat a normal pumpkin rather than a cursed ghost pumpkin. Also if a ghost inhabited a pumpkin that means that in pokemon universe there are normal pumpkins, and probably people selling it.
I’d try Tatsugiri
Tauros
1)  "Pumpkin spice" isn't pumpkin, it's the spices used in pumpkin pie.  2) Pumpkin is a squash, and goes great with savory dishes.
Grunt boy using magic and turning into a gamer then saying grass is blue is just peak comedy
I still don't think it's going to beat TF2 at least in the long run
lol
What pokemon could you make alcohol from? Sugary and honey pokemon like bounsweet and combee. Make cider from applins and banana beer from tropius hahahah
what about herbs and spices? Bayleaf literally has Bayleaves growing out of it's neck. Use those oddish, tangela and chikorita leaves to season those miltank steaks. Hell yeah
Definitely the best video you've ever made Bro. (Australia) PS yeah kangaroo has to be cooked on a very low heat otherwise it goes super tough. Cooked right it is very tender and tasty.
“And since i like to eat.” Please tell me if anyone HATES EATING
You forgot the vanillix Pokemon
Ooh i want a creamy and cheezy chicken Alfredo rn dude.... Yum
i would probably enjoy a miltank burger with some shuckle juice as a beverage
Eating a Cloyster is kinda sus😂
"Pumpkin spice" is in no way pumpkin. Pumpkin itself is more of a squadh flavor. Pumpkin spice is literally just the spices that are put into a pumpkin pie. So most people think they like pumpkin when they really like just the spices.
To be fair. Seeds are food too
Can you eat a bulbasaur
turtle
What about icecream pokemon?
if the vegan teacher sees this, she's going to go crazy
togepi.
Poke fried farfetched 🍗🍗
Vanilish line
Its nice how you forgot bout the lechonk's evolutiom
I know this is a year old but I just discovered you. Anyways, as a Cajun from south Louisiana, I would absolutely F up those crab Pokemon. I always said how tasty a Krabby looked lol. Corphish's claws might be bad, but I bet its tail is good boiled haha
With the if they hunted it that much it must be good thing, the dodo bird was hunted to extinction for food however it's meat was according to sources not pleasant however there was a fat based sauce that apparently made it palatable
- all these Pokémon are too small!  You know in the real world we mostly eat baby animals, right? Or at least barely young adult? The meat gets tougher on almost everything with age, so it doesn't make any sense either financially or culinarily to continue farming after they reach a big enough size that growth slows significantly.    Also people eat things like quail and squirrel.
how about phesandippidy    Edit: I have no idea why I said this 1 year ago
Gigantamax alcremie
But it already be cooked 6:16
I would eat a Lechonk for bacon and Chansey for eggs for breakfast. And maybe shuckle juice
What about vanillsh
2:24 alcohol yippie
id eat dipplin
How could you not eat tatsugiri its literly sushi
Fried Arceus sounds good
The only upsetting part of this video is Mikey not knowing the culinary delight of a warm pumpkin soup with bacon, some rosemary, and a little cheese biscuit on the side~   Or I guess a pumpkaboo soup with thick sliced grumpig? I don't know what kind of herbaceous mons we have but maybe rosemary just exists in the pokeworld on it's own.
0:18 some people raise chickens for meat, some people raise chickens for companionship; it’s not like it’s an outlandish concept in our real world.
I wouldn't eat Bambi, but it's mom....
The problem with the Slowpoke poaching is that it was being forced at unsustainable rates.
I like lechonk
that thumbnail is not good 😭
your going to make miltank go exitinct,hahahahahahahaha XD
cloyster would be sorta chewey
w
eating Grumpig: Why my bacon taste like colors
Bulbasaur legs because you can use the thing on its back for herbs
you missed vanulluxe
7:50 WAIIIIIIT IS THAT ROYALPEAR-                                                    .                                    I DON'T  WANT TO EAT ROYALPEAR
petillil tea + watered down bownsweet sweat  think about it
I hope you singlehandedly wat miltank to extinction.
Vegans will stick to Oran berry’s we’re fine
Cheese  ;)
also we need a shinotic evo
mikey just roasted all gamers ever
I wonder If You Could Eat Miltank's Sausage Nipples Like A Hotdog. A Hot Steak Dog
corphish is tasty but not crawdaunt due to its dark type
The only things a person can eat in the Pokemon world are Pokemon themselves, what Pokemon produce, and what Pokemon also eat. Eating Pokemon is probably the most practical option for people in the long run for the sake of population control and to make sure the Pokemon still have enough of their own food to eat.
Don't hurt ma boi appletun! Also if shuckle juice is fermented berries, it is therefore wine. Doesn’t that make pokemon alcoholics?
O:19 What the fu-
Surprised not to see the HONEY!
Dookieshed did this first, so shoutout to him.
Being vegan must be hard in the Pokémon world given that grass types exist
Where’s Loppuny
0:18 I Searched this once... I'm not Joking!
Just spitballing here, but I bet that a slowpokes tail falling off is only painless when it is supposed to fall off.
Torchic: I can't wait to see who my trainer is! Me: CHICKEN NUGGET
Galarian zapdos
Pheasant is amazing
Ok mikey, would you eat a pumpkin worm. Kind of like a gummy worm, pumpkin flavored and totally not a real worm pumpkin flavored.
I wouldn't worry too much about food items that can and are used as bug repellents - this is how cinnamon, lavender, garlic, and many others are used in our world and are obviously, not dangerous for consumption :)
I knew as soon as I saw the thumbnail he’d be dunking on Miltank hard.
14:19 ITS_GRUNTYBOI GAMING
In certain restaurants in Vietnam, ur able to order a still-beating snake heart. So, there's that lovely food item. No idea if that's still an option, but it was when i 1st read about it
You do know what shackle is based on, right? It’s not a turtle, it is an infectious fungus that bores roots through rock, I’ll pass on it’s ‘excretion’ as some del entries say
"i'd eat his mom tho."
Watching this long after the release of Scarlet and Violet, I assume that you’d be a big fan of Oinkologne pork chops lmao.
Stornaxe
I can't eat anything on pumpkin spice because I'm allergic to cinnamon except for apple pie
I don't know how good it would taste but Snorlax would be able to feed a whole town.
grottle bush berries
14:25 You don’t even need to eat them they can produce cream themself
New series, Michael makes pokemon inspired dishes.
Oh, how much joy it brings me that someone else hates Miltank with all their heart, and wants to see it suffer. Mike, you are now my best friend.
All the regional birds
GMax Alcreame
I dont remember what grass looks like its blue right?(of course not its brown rusted metal that grows)
But Pinoswine is so cute! Why do you want to hurt that little thing?!
I think Nacli would be good for providing flavor to a meal because it’s just salt (NA CL is the chemical composition for table salt if you didn’t know)
We should all go to mallow family restaurant
I’m down for a Pokémon meal any day
Literally Laios from Delicious in Dungeon.
So does the pokmon universe have any cows or chickens or pigs or dogs or anything that is a animal that doesn’t fight or kill or anything it’s like a normal animal
I would marry an Alcremie. Really, I don't think it's that weird
New offer: get the milk and then it dies
weerdear went extinct because from people eating it
Im not eating bamby ill eat its mom
Picking up where Dookieshed left off, I like it
appletun😋
I love the taste of metel so tink dioxid we be selision
Poor milktank
Would you eat a klawf stick though?
Fun fact: shuckles  juice can be seen in the new Pokémon horizon and it’s yellow
eccelgor
Oooh I’m gonna tell PM7 you want to eat one of his favorite Pokémon, Piloswine
I wonder what Arkoos meat tastes like
i like walmart
Why does Pokémon not have a food type
I think Appleton is pie
this moment, just roasted every 5:16
can i eat magikarp? or diced garydos?
Poor miltank😢
Bulbisar
i dont even like cow meat but id eat miltank out of spite
Bruh, i’m eating a miltank right now, and its a steak
I just had a sandwich from tf2 and yes i liked it
A buffalo and a bison are two different animals
Just eat Alcream's cream that it makes, that means MORE *CREAM* .
I got a shiny slurpuff and named it Bakery
I would eat miltank mostly out of spite, I'm looking at you Whitney
0:20  POKEPHILIA ALERT ALERT CALL THE POLICE
RoYaL PeAr CoLlAb CoNfIrMeD 🤓🤓🤓🤓
If you eat Malamar, YOUL BEABLE TO MIND CONTROL SOMEONE!!!!!!! :0
All Indians don't eat beef because religion. me too
You missed majikarp
One word. Vanillite
I love pumpkins♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
1:24 and plus some people have to have reserves of farfetch’d meat
Vanilite
You forgot the ice cream pokemon.  XD
About the bug repellent thing: garlic is also said to ward off bugs iirc so it wouldn't be dangerous to eat
12:53 uhhhh no
magic carp and his cousin
7:00 You're forgetting that you can also eat Toedscool. It even says you can eat the flaps on their body. It's Scarlet entry literally says," The flaps that fall from its body are chewy and very delicious.", and its not a poison type. Same fore Toedscruel. It's Violet entry says," The folds along the rim of its head is a popular delicacy.", so their edible and probably also very tasty I'd assume. 12:43 You're also forgetting the fact THAT WE LITERALLY USE KLAWF CLAWS IN OUR SANDWICHES WHEN WE PICNIC!!! For some of the recipes anyways. . .
"I won't eat bamby, ill eat his mom, tho." Mikey- 2024
Ya know this reminds me of a small random joke I made a while ago..  I always thought that gengar looked like a grape so I basically started calling it “floofy ghost grape”.and now that I watched this video I regret naming mah child AKA my favorite Pokémon after a fruit…..
mareep ?
Hydrapple and Dipplin
*looks at Vanillish, Vanillite, and Vanilluxe*
Did I miss Magikarp
Chiken nugs are not this
Pumpkin hot dog ?
Vanilite and it's evolution line are all ice cream pokemon right so you could eat them on a hot summers Day
You forgot sir fetched
Leave pumpkinboo alone
imagine you eat magikarp alive and then it evolves inside you
To grunty boi:grass is green and makes me itchy
Here’s a Boston Accent pronouncing guide (Pah-K du ca-h in hab- bor-d ya-d)
imagine pancakes/waffles with Blissey/Chancey eggs. or cake or smth like that. that'd be fire
I hate when people talk about how "weird" it is that they eat pokemon in the pokemon world. we eat animals. we are also friends with animals. Cows and pigs can be great friends. they can also be great food. Chickens? I love them in both ways. Fish can be friends, AND food
Slowpoke tails could be a casserole too....
kabuto too
I’d eat a miltank or farfetched, but ain’t no way I’m eating my boy slowpoke’s tail  Also, I’d gladly eat a chansey egg
How can you eat miltank
I'm a weird child I hate meatballs but I love oysters😂
Vanillish?
Pumpkin is eaten usually stuffed with a meaty soup here in brazil
Pumpkin-flavored Oreos
Does he not like vanilla ice cream 🍦 vanillte
Your a wizard grunty boi
Why not austrage (autruche en français) Dotrio and Dudio are both ugly and probably delicious
I would like to eat Arceus
Amazing video🤩😮🥺😊❤
14:11 Time
also G-Max Alcremie (I most likely spelt that wrong) because it is a literal wedding cake
“How’s Malamar gonna mind control me if it’s dead?” -Mandjtv
How you guys feel about lifeforms that are meant to be eaten.
Pureed pumpkin soup with a grilled cheese?
Drowsee *_nuh uh area_*
Disclude gorebyss since gorebyss is based on the long nosed chimera or ghost shark
‘How is Malamar going to mind control me if it’s dead’ Michael’s humor is getting better😂😂😂 Edit: Then he proceeded to say multi-bee vitamin 🥲
Bro eating Miltank beef cuz he got beef
‘I’ll eat his mom tho’  Bro is hunting hard.
‘But if they hunted it that much it’s gotta be good’  Started laughing then remembered the rhino that just got extinct
Tatsugerie
You forgot skwovet and gredent
Did I miss Vanilluxe?
13:41 I don’t like sushi
Isn’t Tatsugiri  just sushi. I think that’s edible i think
someone clearly has not used Milk Drink out of combat.
Torchicken nuggets
I mean, I’m pretty sure I remember hearing that mint is a pretty good natural bug repellent, and we eat that. 🤷‍♀️
Man ive been playingy games all wrong.
Also the tail of a slowpoke regrows
Peta has been very quiet since this dropped...
What about Vanilluxe? It is literally ice cream with a face.
I think Oinkologne could be added…but Im a vegetarian. So, maybe I could also eat Toedscool Flaps in soup?
im sad he didnt mention magicarpp id eat him
Lechonk has a evolution and it's literally a normal pig
I've eaten raw tuna from a sushi roll before and it's okay, but it tastes better cooked. For raw oysters, I wouldn't eat them unless they're cooked either. I'm with you on the pattern of raw oysters.
Lemme guess: ur gonna eat drowzee
What about the ice cream Pokémon, perfect for a sunny day or you could have it as a dessert after eating a Miltank steak with Piloswine bacon with some rice and a nice salad.  For me I'll have Piloswine bacon cooked crispy, not too crispy as you gotta have a little bit of a chew to it in either a toasted white roll with ketchup or a untoasted white roll that is buttered so the roll isn't dry and squeeze tomato ketchup on the bacon with a nice glass of Shuckle juice to wash it down after with some Tropius fruit to eat just for some healthy eating
I would eat tropius fruits *drool*
Is it just me, or is any edible Pokémon considered delicious?
Do a remake of this video with scarlet and vilet
Note to self: Watch this during a meal, not before or after. I'll just be hungry and sad.
The paldea doggos. Not grevard line or the mastobiff line, but the dachsbun line. Its just toasted bread, seems tasty
I feel like this entire video is just the embodiment of Michael being unhinged about eating Pokémon and honestly, I'm here for it.
I just know that some cultures have this obsession with eating anything remotely edible from the sea.   I can guarantee at one point, Finizen, Wailmer, Sharpedo, and even Quilfish were on the menu, not that I recommend eating Fugu (spelling?) unless you don't mind the chance of dying from food poisoning. Even to this day, some Japanese consider sharks and dolphins to be delicacies.    I also find it most likely that it is Oinkolonge and Grumpigs that would be farmed for food. Unlike Tepig, they apparently aren't in demand as Pokémon for new trainers.
New thumbnail
If Misty gets famished enough, I'm sure Togepi would look awfully tasty.....
You forgot eating baby miltanks for veal,
"I'll eat his mom tho🤤😋"  - MandJTV
2:22 POV: That one part of Horizons
You can still eat eggscute, coconuts taste great.
Shukle juice could be wine, but it could also be vinegar; which sounds a lot more delicious than wine.
I would eat blastorest, I hate it and I just want to eat it to see it dead.
Skip ad 5:50
+ hot dogs 🤣🤣🤣😁😁
I'm pretty sure that Malamar tentacles are a powerful hallucinogen, and are a controlled substance.
With the surface level knowledge of pearl farming I have, Cloyster is probably due to lack of trying. Plus, just get a big enough pan and cook it over a fire. That will open it.
I’d be down to try some magicarp
So this video canonises, that Mikey is a basic white girl.
I’m gonna eat fidough because it can be made into pizza or pretzels
You don't have to hate Milbank because you had a hard time with it! I hated Wiglett for the longest time and I don't anymore.
I would eat Onix. Alive, dead, you name it, I’ll eat it.
My dad is from Boston so I know u nailed the accent
I have never eaten a Burger,taco,hot dog and never ever drank a Soda
I'd eat out Bambi's Mom too.😋
I'd try every pokemon.
This made me hungry
As an Australian I can say the to make kangaroo meat taste good you have to eat it raw apparently it's better but if you eat it raw
Why not oinkologne
I think luchonk with some shuckle juice would be amazing
Mikey your my favorite YouTuber and a bunch of ppl I know love you to
Bro, halfway through, I got bored and said, "I need memes." So, I opened Aspitpiay. lol.
so duck are nearly extinct 😢
And the Shuckle part is now canon.  Dot in Pokémon Horizons literally shoved a straw inside a Shuckle and then sucked out its berry juice and she said it was delicious.  Snover's berries were also eaten by Ash and his friends in an episode of the Gen 4 anime.
Your mother
Also what about Magikarp
What about the berries in the game
They should add eating Pokémon to the games.
The reason my skeledirge and annihape died was because I ate them
As a fisher and hunter id wanna try em all. Maybe not eel pokemon though...
Some Pidgeot drumsticks would probably be good!
Mikey you forgot Oinkalone
"i'd like it's flavor and it's demise" got me dying😂!
Vanillite and Vanillish its friggin ice cream
He forgot the sushi Pokemon, tatsugiri!
try seaking because in the sword dex entry says became fatty when breding so you have lots of meat and sushi  go for tatsguri
what about miltank blood since you want miltank dead
Milcery mmmm
My own Pokebreakfast special:  Chansey Breakfast Burrito with Jalapeños, grilled with Moomoo cheese on the inside and outside Piloswine Bacon, cooked limp Petilil tea, 3 Milcery cream, 3 sugar 10 piece Torchic nugget
I think we live in a futuristic devloped technological era and we should not eat meat , fish or crabs because it feels like we are from stone age 🤢
He forgot to put Rattata in the chicken section
Smallive oil
where wishwashi at? yes they may be small but are tasty which is why its best to have a few in one sitting
Imagine if a shiny Pokémon has different meat colour
Hey Mikey, when you said you would drink Miltank's milk, do you really really want to suck on dem uders.
Completely forgot about Vanillish and the evolutions which are all ice cream pokemon, great for summer days.
i would love a nice warm cup of sinistea ;) sinistea is the cup not the tea itself.
I had an uncle who made Buffalo burgers until he passed
If im eat a magikarp the fact im making a magikarp and chip
Bro imagine being one of these Pokémon exited to have a trainer and they just eat parts of them or them entirely
I would like some FIRE calamari because I hate squid and would love to decries their population.
Does pumpkaboo have seeds because i would definitely eat roasted pumpkaboo seeds
This is why i think another potential pokemon type is Food Weak to Normal (and a few others) Strong against Fighting (and a few others, with excuses along the lines of "Overeating does XYZ to this") (edit)   It relates to pokemon who mutated over the centuries to become:  - Bigger eaters  - More "Food shaped"  - Have usefull/adictive edible product be formed by their bodies  (- and the sad side effect of this also making MANY (1st stage) pokes, the bottom of the food chain)
When I was little i thought that it meant farfetchd could cook
i would love to eat gardevoir.....
Gardevoir and lopunny
10:06 Actually, I made the pumpkin soup from Twilight Princess using Salmon (since Reekfish isn't real), and its very delicious
So let's see here, trying to put multiple items into one meal... Chansey eggs, probably scambled with Miltank milk. Piloswine bacon. Petilil tea. Tropius fruit on the side. We have the makings for what sounds like one of the best breakfasts ever.
Vulpix, Eevee, Lycanroc left the chat                                       - A chinese
bro vanillite and its evolution line is literally vanilla ice cream and also magikarp seems like it oculd be a good salmon like fish
I always thought Seaking looked delicious.
3:23 that one kid at school
I mean, Magikarp, obvs
Pikachu I would eat pikachu
The reason why Petilil tea can also be used as a bug repellent is probably because it contains caffeine, which tea and coffee plants naturally have _to deter insects_
2:03 bro really said hear me out 😭
3:22 mandjtv out of context
I'm so surprised you didn't mention eating crosses no matter the side effects. New fan art coming;)
I would drink a sinistea and a polteagiest
You forgot one for calamari which was octillery
MilkManMike would be offended!
Now we know where Bambi’s mom went to (Mikey/Mickey’s stomach.)
This is just "what if pokemon was palworld"
I THINK SHOULD EAT GENGAR(;
You didn't mention oinkologne
This is why they should make a Pokémon cooking game
Oinkalogne I feel would make good bacon
Your not wrong
Pumpkaboo curry!
just defeated a corphish in x and y when you first mentioned them
Vanillite and vanilluxe?
What about oinkilon😂
I would maybe eat bellsprount idk
Tatsugiri is literally sushi
PETA is going to be knocking on your door
Fido
Im pretty sure the Rocket+Slowpoke incident was over cruel harvesting, lopping them off causing harm, animal cruelty i guess.
You should have released this when Scarlett and viloet came out. Oinkolune would have been perfect for the pig section.
Not u mikey
3:22 bite is super effective on ghost types
mikey needs to come down to trinidad and try pumpkin curry shrimp and roti
Yummy miltank😂
You should mix the bouncesweetsuite sweat with the pedilill tea
The perfect Micheal food mix Pokemon is appletun (pie), pumpcaboo (pumpkin) and alcriemie (cream)
kill it!!!
0:19 um…
It was a mistake, to watch this video hungry.
You could grind down parts of the Nacli line and use it a salt.PUT IT ON THE MILTANK MEAT!!!!!
try t atsugiri
Bro the reaction on milktank😂
I would eat remoraid and octillery because, come on, octopus is a delicacy in places and remoraid is just a tiny salmon, gimme a cooked alpha and im good to go
I like Unfezent
Madigcarp
If the malamari had glowing spots you would be mind controlled.
I hate miltank to.
Pumpkin your mom she's a sweet treat
mmmm yummy
Make another
I love how eating many of these mons' products won't kill or even harm them. Especially all the fruit. Makes me want to be a Grass-type specialist. As for the meat, well, you can't have steak without killing a Miltank or two. I won't mind killing one, say, a hundred. Which is weird because I usually stick to poultry and fish in real life, because of global warming.
Im boutta get a miltank burger
Pumpkin Tea's
i think palworld took inspiration from this video
you missed octillery
U missed the ice cream pokemon the whole line could be eaten
Yes
Repost the video so that every minute, the screen turns more gray
Personally I would love to try crawdaunt étouffé
Miltank
Miltank
Miltank
Miltank
Miltank
I’ve never seen someone wear a hat like that to the point it looks like a yamaka
Yes 1 more
how the hell does this video have 72 views, 197 likes, 6733 comments and an mandjtv comment section
I need a miltank burger so miltank can suffer and I love burgers
"I'll eat his mom though" is definitely going to appear in the next meme review. Out of context.
yamper
appletun's skin is either classified as meat, or a fruit pastry, since it's based on an apple pie. the long strips on its back, when removed, remind me of those bar-shaped donuts
There's no need to eat Milcery/Alcremie! The Pokémon World likely has regular cream to eat.
Moxie thumbnail?????
Imagine if someone in the Pokémon world raised a spoink up to a grumpig to eat it but then his baby son called it Gum-pig and got really attached to it so the guy just butchers a miltank for the family instead.
Bruh Klawf is literally just a rock
Grunti boi should be a magishion
🤤 - Have You Try'd, Cat Meat ?    It's Fyk'n, Delicious !  It's a Chinese, Recipe  & It's Real !
What about the vaniluxe line?
dude artecuno zapdos motres giant birds and zapdos has succulent drumsticks
Yay Pumpkin
Ray con starts with r like team rocket
Don't eat my slow poock
Paldean Delicacies: Dachsbun, Arboliva, Nacli, Toedscool, Toedscruel, Tatsugiri.
Veluza are also said to have a mild but delicious flavor. I'm not that much of a seafood fan, but I wouldn't mind trying some Veluza
Give me some delicious balbasaur.
Also all the Pokemon listed would probably be the prey of large apex/predatory Pokemon like Tyrantrum or garchomp
I have the ultimate breakfast meal, pancakes made with Miltank milk, burrito consisting of Miltank steak and Chansey eggs, and an ice cold glass of freshly made shuckle berry juice
The swine line is a 🦣 not pig wooly mammoth
what about a female gardevour
Nacli line salt would be perfect seasoning for the Farfetch'd meal.  And for Miltank/Turos/Mammoswine meat.
Some people eat insects and arachnids, which is fair since they're basically just land crustaceans and are apparently super nutritious. With this in mind, you could convince me to eat dried Nymble or Kricketune, but I wouldn't have the heart to eat some Bug-types (too cute, like Wimpod, Ribombee, even Galvantula) or the stomach to eat most (too creepy/dangerous, like every Bug/Poison, Parasect, Pheromosa and Buzzwole, and so much more).
in my headcanon i think if you peel of appletun's skin in about four to five minutes it would grow back
i would eat Gyrados, Groudon, Kyogre, Dipplin, Hydrapple, Flapple, Reshiram, Regice snow cone, Vannilite, Vanillish, Vanniluxe, and finally Arceus. (and no I'm not kidding i would eat all of these pokemon groudon probably tastes like ground beef and the legendaries probably taste good.)
eel meat is the bomb dude, so good 🤤
Goregiest would take your soul before you can even attempt to eat it so that wouldn't be a good idea at all it is NOT a nice pokemon
appletun's skin would technically be a dessert, because I see it as more of a sweet flaky pastry then actual meat like miltanks meat would be
why is miltank getting so much hate from you, it's literally a cute little dairy cow, it's not harming anybody, it's just munching on grass and being a happy lil miltank, leave it alone for goodness shake
I also think Gigantamax Alcremie Would have good taste because it’s cake
Give  me some exclusive Giratina meat!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just realised most food in scarlet/violet have no meat and it could be because of this video 😂😂😂
Grunty Boi is now magical boi. I can see the magical girl fanart now. Go wild with this new idea fanbase lmao.
Hear me out on this folks. Lopunny is a large rabbit, Rabbit is a common food in many parts of the world. So with how much meat should be on a pokemon like lopunny. It would probably a worth enough meal.
I know that sounds a little weird but I might eat gargangle Salt is good and well, I might season it on a burger
Dondozo. I don’t care that it’s massive. I don’t care it could swallow me whole. I’m from the South and that thing is a catfish. Bread it up and fry it because I want it on my plate. Wishcash too for the same reason.
dude shrimp is delicious im gonna fry up a clauncher
dude the id eat his mother though  got me dying
Nothing for Vanillish!? It's both literally ice cream, AND has a name like delicious!
...yes, Michael, we know that you would eat Miltank all the time.
while execute are seeds if there from alola they will be coconuts and most other seeds are edible like acorns and i think that execute is a dumb pile of acorns because i think that kantonian exxegutor are oak trees
Wait Texans have cold days? 1:05
11:24 and Quaquaval
6:14 Torchicken nuggets
3:56 Same with me but with Quaquaval
Well, on garlic bread, that is.
Capsakid and Scovillain would also work as I also tried spicy red peppers
How would you eat the pokemon if when you "make them faint" they disappear into nothingness
Michael: “Sign me up for a Chansey/Blissey breakfast omelette each day and I’ll be doing great! Not happiny tho, it carries a rock  Teacher next day: Why are you laughing Me: Nothing My Brain: Happiny rock breakfast omelette
Vanillite Vanillish Vanilluxe
That vegan teacher would kill you in the miltank part😂
vegan teachers gotta see this😂
expect an baculegion knockong on your door
I wish I could buy raycons but they don't deliver to NZ, or at least they didn't the last times I tried.
3:21 underatted MandJTV quote  “I’m not going to eat bambi. I’ll eat his mom though!”
9:50 I feel like it is worth pointing out that Pumpkin Spice isn’t even pumpkin. It’s just the ingredients typically in Pumpkin pie that makes it taste good including Cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Pumpkin spice products don’t even necessarily include Pumpkin as an ingredient.  So all those Pumpkin Spice products aren’t Pumpkin flavored at all. They are flavored with the stuff in Pumpkin pie.
In Pokémon master journey. The clauncher is mentioned that its claw is edible by the Pokédex itself.
2:41 I would gladly eat the tepig evolution line bc I hate them.
Also dragonite...
I think lapris,garados,magikarp,combee,dipplin,pigey,piggioto and spearow
Nah Lechonk would taste great
Pilloswine is a mammoth
Magikarp?
I reckon Gyarados would have some juicy, fatty meat
Seeds are food too
The good thing about Appleton is that it doesn't mind being a snack and the shell or pie on its back grows back. SO Infinite pie!! Another thing I would like to say is that Appleton should change its pie flavor depending on the season , so when its fall its pumpkin pie. Peach and berry pie or just berry pie for spring. Chocolate pie for winter I think Pokémon could do that, it would be cool!!
Veluza left the chat It’s Pokédex entry on Scarlet says :When Veluza discards unnecessary flesh, its mind becomes honed and its psychic power increases. The spare flesh has a mild but delicious flavour.
the vanilite line would be pretty tasty
speaking of eating do you think a sharpedo would try to eat a wailord because real sharks eat whales
Hatterina
You just know that some kid in the Pokémon world has been dared to eat Crawdaunt meat
Uhh, you do know that pumpkin spice doesn't actually have any pumpkin in it, right? It's just a blend of spices that pair up with it well, so if you like pumpkin spiced stuff, I don't think Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist are gonna help you with that...
what about oddish and pikachu
I learned from this video that MandJTV would not eat burning humans
Mikey: “I’ll eat his mom tho”
Tatsugiri
MMM GOOD EATIN  *consooms a milktanc*
imagine eating octillery
6:38 that aint Pidgeot silly
You forgot gogoat milk
Eat the miltank, eat it please do it eat it
Oinkalone
hisuians:were the smoliv
I love fish and the fact that basculin is remarkably tasty is my top pick for Pokémon I would eat.
I don’t think you’ll ever have a chansey egg breakfast burrito because they are very protective of them. Plus it would be very rude to steal its most prized possessions.
wait but some people keep pigs as pets and..... BACON and eggs
i feel like i remeber those ¨eggs¨ being rocks for some reason
As someone who has had pumpkin with meat its actually pretty good
Here me out here, Pumpkin Spice Petilil teas with milcery cream go cool it off (if you prefer cool tea)
I would eat lopunny 😏
bulbosur bulbs
6:56 What about Toedscruel? Those flaps are said to be put into recipes, and you did say you like mushrooms. Plus with its Ground/Grass typing, there's no potential harm from toxins.
Also a Wooper Whopper from burbur king
I gonna eat some scizor food becuase im a mega scizor
Eat feesh
At 13:56 in the show ash and and two of the girls I forget their names in the ultra sun show I think same with team rocket they try to eat some which ash and his friends did but jessie got a poison one when they where looking for grandpa forest or the Pokémon dranpa
Also you would never eat our lord and saviour lechonk would you? (Yes I know there are 4 Pokémon gods now just don’t question the words of the texts)
What about tatsuguri
Doesn't Beedrill have some honey?
Mikey cooking up a Miltank: “WHO’S MOOING NOW?!”      (Bonus points if you get that reference)
Wait, so if Slowpoke can shed its tail, then can Slowbro and Slowking too? I mean, Slowbro is just a slowpoke with a weird fish-clam on its tail, so if it sheds its tail, does it un-evolve? Does it turn back into a slowpoke?
Torchicken nuggets
What about smolive? Its an olive
Depending on Alcremie’s form, it could be inedible. Also do not eat Gigantamax Alcremie. Trust me.
humanowd
i would eat oinkologne ngl
You forgot oinkologne
You forgot magicarp
My favorite meat is chicken 😊
“I don’t have time for this.” Made me laugh
I would make my teeth nice and healthy because of loppuny milk
Ah yes eating Bambis mom and sending multiple kids down a traumatic spiral
Gyarados would probably be delicious
PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEAAAASEEEEE COOK UP A BLASTOISE THAT WOULD BE DELICOUSSSSSS GEJWJSDJKDLEODKDNJEJ
"i wouldnt eat bambi,but i would eat its mom though"
I get that Mickey called miltank wagyu a5 as a joke but theoretically if wagyu a5 miltank did exist in the Pokémon world would that mean the higher level the miltank or the stronger it is (for example ev,hm,ability, and nature) the higher quality the meat is I would also wonder how items would affect it for example leftover,berries,revives and potions
Scrambled Blissey eggs with Oinkologne bacon and a Farfetch’d leek would be great!
I think bulbasaurus Bob would be delicious
Surprised politoad was not on here because of frog legs
Mikey: I hope there is no mind control side affects ether and how is malimar gonna mind control me if it's dead   Me: "rich laugh"
Pumpkin phriters
Then we having Pokemon buffet
I mean the vanilluxe line is just ice cream I mean really cold ice-cream but like  If it's too cold then maybe like a milkshake or something
Magicarp
I like miltank, but damn….I would eat a miltank burger.
Gator meat is good try bigcricodile
What about comebee honey
how can you forget icecream pokemon vanillish
Pumpkin salmon made me throw up
Do you like pumpkin cookies?
What about bubasour’s bulb?
YOU FORGOT SMOLIV!!!
how the hell do you not like lamb lamb is amzing
good video
I'm with him on the pumpkin 🥧🍮🥞🎃
I'm with him on the pumpkin 🥧🍮🥞🎃
Ok I know this is far in the future but who would play a survival game where you can catch pokemon and also kill and eat them.
I would eat pachurisu togedemaru and Pikachu
Is it weird that I’ve never seen cherum before?
Pore alcremie a poor cute little dollar of cream wanting to bE EATEN well if your just eating the cream it produces that’s fine
Grunty boy did magic and no one bats an eye
I bet today sponsor would be good for team rocket because the symbol is a R
Chasu prom from those pig pokemon sounds sooo good 🤤
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LITTERAL AND PHYSICAL SENTIENT ICECREAMS WITH FACES YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE FLAOATING FROZENED SWEETS
OOOOOOHHHHHH SPICED BOILED KINGLER KRABBY CRABRAWLER CRABONIMABLE CLAUNCHER CLAWITZER AND FRIED CLAMPERL SHELLDER CLOYSTER CLAUNCHER CLAWITZER FEEBAS FERALIGATR AND REMORAID  WOULD BE DELICOUS .
There is a Pokémon that’s just ice cream 🍦
I would definintly eat Psyduck , Golduck , Torchic , Combusken , Blaziken , Ducklett , and Swanna scrambled eggs . Duck eggs and chicken eggs when they're scrambled are delicious .
8:52 Considering the only Pokémon rights group we see is TEAM PLASMA, I'm sure it's fine.
Ill eat his mom though
"Farfetched"d makes a delicious meal especially cooked with leek"  Might as well make Vullaby thanksgiving turkey.
I think that Barbaracle's oysters could be tasty as long as they are washed to the point where their as clean as possible and add some hot sauce and crackers would eb pretty good on a sunny but windy day
This is a kind of dark
Sunflora, rip them seeds out and eat ‘em up.

Tatsugiri sushi’s
For those who have eaten gators, do you think the gator pokemon would taste good? I think crawkanot would be very good
Gogo milk they farm it for its milk products

Vanillite's line
I would eat a buneary with sinistea
Magic carp Do you know any short in the show him cut up?

Some people eat frog legs
Goldengo would be absolutely delicious
great vid, austin fc shirt gotta go tho, as a crew fan not my favorite
“Hey people do it, so it must be safe.” - Every Tiktoker in 2020
Surprised Octillery and Grapploct weren’t mentioned. Often,calamari is a combination of squid and/or octopus
What about Honey that's made by Combee & Vespiquen? I don't think Beedrill make honey because they're based more on Wasps which also don't make honey.
Vaporeon fins, it has a dex entry saying there delicious
eat driplin a literal candy apple
POV the vegan teacher😳
KILL THE MAMOSWIN KILL THE MAMOSWIN

Castform would taste good
There should be a video with John about this where every Pokémon you catch, the other has to eat.
What about vannilish
This video in a nutshell: bane of vegan weebs😂
Why would you not eat magickarp
Mandjtv killing a bunch of miltank - miltank not deciding its stats or looks
raycon deez nuts across your fase
I absolutely love seafood and also would add petilil tea with combee 🍯
He forgot about skowet
chansey egg + miltank milk + capsaikid tooth = pokemon omelet
I would say the bulb on the top of Bulbasaur
This isn't morally gray this is morally orange
Next video: Every Gym Leader I would Eat.
Yes eat Milltank
Oinklogne is the most normal pig and as a new jersey resident im down for some oinklonge porkroll
I definitely think that I would eat a lanchonk
Bounsweet is based on a mangosteen, and mangosteen skin has been described as beneficial for skin health. Here in Indonesia, we have a commercial for a popular mangosteen skin extract product with the most memorable jingle, so I suppose Bounsweet's skin would have the same benefit.
Is no one going to talk about how grunty boi unlocked magic
Pumpkin and meat is really good
Can Team Sky PLEASE be a team in Pokemon Go, Mikey?
Mikey: greeting poke fans  Captions: gory teams for events.
If I was a trainer I would NEVER eat my Pokemon!  To me Pokemon are friends not food.
Better thumbnail
Torchicken nuggets
My hypothesis is that the sword and shield used to eat things are just this is edible but that seems weird so we're not going to say people eat them now.
Hey hey unfeazent is cool
You forgot the vanilite evaluation
That Vegan Teacher 💀
Well can't eat, but could use combee honey for teas or sweet things.
Ludicolo is both duck and algae
I pretty sure nilotic will make you sleep

Dynamax is going to solve world hunger
Eating an alcreme sounds DELICIOUS but to sad. . . GOODTHIND THEY CAY MAKE FROSTING ACCORDING TO THE ANIME
Question of the day: what’s your favorite food? (Mine is ham)
Vanillite ! And an update with Gen 9 : Oinkologne, Fidough, Dachsbun, Smoliv and Tatsugiri
No Vanillite line in the last category? They're just ice cream with faces
You shouldn’t eat gorbyss nor huntail Gorbyss is based off a chimera  and huntail is based for a oarfish
He of course made this BEFORE the reveal of Onikologne, the Pig that looks like just a pig.
WAIT! if you don't eat the alcremie you can get more CREAM from the alcremie
I swear you changed this thumbnail twice already.
Morelull and Shiinotic are definitely psychedelic mushrooms, Mikey
Was surprise that he wouldn't eat Drowzee.
Farfetch'd is endangered  Shiny hunters: Say no more fam
I like headphones
american lamb is garbage, but here in australia it is an absolute godsend
and the starters? eat a charmernder and not only one is down but you have baby dragon meat! and you don't have AAAANY mitical or legendary ypu would eat? like mew! it would be SSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPER nutrisios and problaby very tasty (not mewtwo< he's basicly a mutation) and another one for the plant category is pokemons like chikorita! pell the body, cloud it down or whit an ice pokemon or a firzer and eat!
Try vanillite, vanillish and vanillux.  THEY ARE BASICALLY ICE CREAM
Combee honey, Magikarp, and Octillery.
Micheal promotes eating endangered Pokémon
*coughs* tatsugiri
Is it vegan to eat a plant pokemon🤔?
With the effort you have to go through to eat Pumpkaboo, you may as well just eat a regular pumpkin. 🤣
Smoliv
Wait, if pokemon were married to people, then would I have been able to eat my own spouse.
3:51 whitney.
NOBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS A POKÉMON NAMED *LE CHONK*
Try Pumpkin Curry
I would want to try Fossil Pokémon meat I could make Tyrantrum meatballs
@3:23 without the Bambi part.
4:04 HSI Grand Tip Boy!
Clamperl isn't an oyster or even a calm.  It's caviar.  It's already ready for consumption 😂
Vanillite?
so lets get back to MEAT 👹
Tentacruel and it's evolution    Now you may be wondering why I chose these they are octopuses
“I’ll eat it’s mom tho”
Bro what about exeggcute and exeggutor they are eggs and coconuts respectively or eggs on a tree it's a bit complicated but you get my point don't you Mikey.
"People do it, it must be safe." - Mikey, 2022
Shuckle = Gluck Gluck juice
You're telling me you wouldn't eat a Vanilluxe? A Combee's honey? Oinkologne? Dachsbun? I'd eat a Oinkologne/Dachsbun hotdog for sure
what about vanilite😊
I love the thumbnail btw
Nom yum nom
3:10 deer moment
Interestingly in the anime, Ash and his friends meet a snover with berries growing on its body.
Wants to eat Slowpoke tail ....Can confirm Micky is Grunty Boi!!!
Mikey: “Psyduck is too small.” Psyduck: Is casually almost twice the size, and 20x the weight of a normal duck.
Not going to eat the dessert Pokemon?
Is grunty boi from Kentucky cause here the grass is blue
Tatsugiri?
Are you gonna eat lechonks evolution?
Vanillight
Tatsugiri. Do I need to explain myself?
Mikey really be like “I too enjoy consuming food to stay alive”
"I'll eat his mom though" -Out of context Mikey 2022
I Love how Mikey and Grunty Boi are just Pals now.
I mean the petilil bug repelling thing is as farfetch'd  as you might think, we drink coffee which is high in caffeine aka a natural pesticide and mint tea is made from mints which also repel insects and small mammals
magicarp, its Dex entries talk about how often it dies do to being incredibly stupid and is often found floating on seaweed. while not the meatiest of fish pokemon, if seal and rat pokemon eat it, it can't be all that bad.
Swirlix is actually a dog with sweet sweat, sort of. Just shaped like Cotton candy
Pincurchin is a pokemon wich you might eat people open theese black or plurple sea spike and crack it open and there is yellow creamy meat i thaught the same thing with pincurchin but has more meat whitch has deformed into a butt mouth    Edit: idk how this comment only got 1 like in 1 year
I would choose lopunny 🤨
I wonder what garbador would taste like
Maybe cursed pumpkin is spicy
😈👿🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡
For the Slowpoke, yeah, I'd have the Aloalan Tail Stew, but I'd also eat its skin if it was in bacon or jerky form. Maybe I'd even eat its paws, if they were deep-fried.
Bear meat exists so I'd eat Ursaring. Atleast to try
Psyduck the literal duck is to far from being a duck...aight
YOU WOULD GET PINK PUMPKIN PIE
12:12 I'd be a little more hesitant with Crabominable because it is based on a real animal called a Yeti Crab and it is unknown if  Yeti Crabs are edible.
He would eat miltank to extinction
slowpoke is my favorite pokemon but its tail sounds delicious
YOU MISSED DROWSEY!!!!! XD
What about the leaves on bulbasors back not the flower
Pumpkin is pretty good
5:50 end of sponser  dont thank me
Primal Growdon
How about vanila
Gruty boy why
Someone should tell this man that Pumpkin and Pumpkin Spice are 2 different things. Pumpkin Spice is just nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and ginger.
Breaking news Man has single handedly caused Miltanks extinction
i have never caught/used oinkologne but it is just a pig like oinkologne bacon or an oinkologne ham sandwich or an oinkologne porkchop sounds fricken delicious and also tatsugiri is just sushi thats alive like it is a live fish on rice i don't know how to describe the sushi of the pokemon world any other way and sunkern is a sunflower seed like people eat sunflower seeds i think and the smolive line kinda looks tasty i would eat the olive on shiny smolive's head like smolive is an olive like its in the name and i think people also eat rabbit but idk and you forgot octillery and some magikarp fish sticks sound really good could possibly  but that is all the pokemon i think someone could eat
'I would eat his mom' LOL 😂🤣
Maybe The Vanillite line would be tasty. Don't Castellia cones have to do with them? The Ice cream sold in Castellia city in Unova. I would defeinitely like to try one. This video was fun haha
I’m confused about oinkalone
gigantamax alcreamie is just sentient cake
togepi when its in its egg state
dauschbun hands down best pokemon to eat
people also eat fresh urchins so maybe a freshly caught pincurchin would be good?
Don’t blame milke tank akeis made tham that way
He forgot fidough
*Vaporeon**                Also 2:00
Get ready to chow down!
3:46 it is good thing there is no that vegan poketuber.
Honestly, I would eat Slowpoke tail because of all the talk about the delicousness of it and all. Also, I'd use Chansey or Blissey eggs to make pancakes. AND another thing, I would eat the small ball on Cherubi because IT HAS TO BE TASTY IF STARLY EAT IT, RIGHT? ANOTHER ANOTHER thing, I'd be down to try Basculin, even though I don't eat fish because I have loads of 'em as pets, but still, I'd be down to try it. ALSO ALSO ALSO, I'd be down to try any of the crabs OTHER than Kingler because I love Kingler and I would not want to harm it. Also also also also, I do NOT EVER want to harm a Cloyster because it's just so cool and, I WOULD eat Shellder bc its tiny and i can just crack it open right? Also, Clamperl is pretty and no harming the pretty Pokemon EVER. Aside from Cherubi, and yes, I consider it a little pretty because the color. ALSO ALSO ALSO ALSO ALSO, I think dat Fearow (that ugly) would be yummy 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
There literally is an ice cream Pokemon
what is weird in th fact that they talk about friendship, and also eat pokemon The same thing is with animals irl Not all animals can be eaten, and not all pokemon can be eaten special bond can be made with every animal irl and with every pokemon.
I would eat ultra necrozma
You should try Mr.Mime from pallet town. He's delicious
Thank god the vegan teacher is gone or she would level a building watching this.
Magickarp
GIGANTAMAX ALCREME IS A GOSH DANG CAKE
Mikey is the kind of guy to ask a group of scientist that brings back the mammoth to turn it into a meatball
3:22 That line sounds so wrong out of context
AYO WHAT CINDAQUIL DOING
I would eat lopunny,I hate it and it might be good,just like miltank!
I'd like some febass sushi plz
I think arbok would be delicious snake is very good
Dude just eat real vegetables
snowcrab
Sea urchins are a delicacy in the Philippines and I love it if pincurchin was noted to be tasty I would eat it
Snorlax can taste like a Marshmello
"I wouldn't eat Bambi... I would eat his mom though" -Michal from MandJTV
Don't eat pidove
"I'll eat his mom though." (Out of context Mikey quotes)
When mikey says shulke juice i think of the thats What she said meme
Oikalone is a pig to dude it’s perfect
Magicarp
Pumpkin poisen
I like to imagine tht some Pokémon are put in a farm and those are the only ones tht get eaten Very wishful thinking but I can think what I want
If pokemon was real I would use this to see what Pokémon is good to eat
Personally I think oinkologne sounds pretty good to eat
The ice cream Pokémon
i don't remember what grass is like. me: sees leafs in the background
I want a rainbow roll made with both forms of basculin and some crabraller meat
You could eat diglet he is basically a potato plus its nose has lot's of nutritional value
Try some numal, i guess it might be good camal meat, plus it cant feel pain
To be honest as a vegetarian this hurts  😭
At least he didn't mention a water type eeveelution 😅
Cherry-like balls 💀
Veluza discards excess flesh to boost speed and it’s psychic power and one of it’s dex entries describes them having a “mild but delicious flavour”
U aint gonna have a “cold winter day” in hawaii
Pokémon but c o n s u m e
Cow tongue tacos 😧
1234567890mmmmmmm

2:34 your telling me piloswine is a pig ITS A LITEREAL WOOLY MAMMOTH
Are we talking the Pokémon itself or stuff that they make? Cause I’m totally down to try combee honey
I'd eat combee's honey
...Excuse me but have we not considered the Vanillite line?
Bro forgot the actual food pokemon VANILISH
Ur eating my orange lobster
....  so is blazikin cooking its self on the inside?
No grunty boi grass is orange duh
qwilfish could probably be good if prepared correctly
Eat drowzey for the same reasons as miltank
Slowpoke seems yummy ngl. Like, I would eat ALL of him. Not just his tail.
I’d recommend a dusknoir to help you with the pumpkins
Mikey, don’t drink Miltank milk, you’ll turn into one!
grunty boy never fails to dissapoint me with his classical music and memoirs grunty boy is my favourite charactor that mikey plays as he is so so funny i  grunty boy and in every video where he sponnsers  at the end of the sponersing he says tataa i love it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Michael: I wouldn’t eat Bambi, I would eat his mom though  Bambi: …what did you just say….?
how about Magikarp and Feebas?
chikorite meat would be veggies and meats (prolly red meat) plus i think its meat would be flavourful
EAT AN ORAN BERRY!
SO YOUR WOULDNT EAT THE BIG SPICY CHICKEN BUT YOU WOULD EAT THE MEDIUM ONE?
BUT ONLY ITS SWEAT?!?!?!?
How do you miss the obvious joke?
Top 1 DROWZEE
WE ARE GETTING THE. ✨ GRUNTY LORE ✨
Plus we have pets and still eat animals in rl. it's pretty natural, we just think it's weird in games usually since they aren't real animals, there's prob some vegans in the pokemon world anyways
Get grunty boy some grass and outside
the issue of slowpoke tails in gen 2 is how they overharvest them
okay hear me out........turtles
Fact: Exeggcute is classified as the egg pokemon in the games, not the seed pokemon
Peta is gonna be angry 🤣
My list is  Lopunny  Gardivoer  Salazal  Braxen  Lucario  Oh you mean like food
stop changing the thumbnail
I have to say, I will eat Bulbasaur’s cabbage on its back
DESTROY THE MILKTANK BY EATING THEM WHILE WATCHING THEIR FLESH GETTING DEVOURED
Asian people would probably pick the dog Pokémons
I don't like the main characters in pokemon games, but 3:23
I would eat Rufflet. I mean, it's a chicken!
Bro just became the villain of Bambi
Magacarp
personally i would like to try Garchomp tail ( its best if you dont think about it to hard)
3:40 AND 3:51 IM DYING MAN😂😂 😂
How dare you kills Bambi’s mom😂
he forgot vanillite
Fidough line and the Lechonk line and PM7
Don’t now what you talking about kangaroo is delicious
You missed gogoat as it is a lamb we can make lamb curry out of it which will prolly be delicious.
Somewhere in the Pokémon equivalent of Louisiana, there's a man making the most delicious Crawdaunt Jambalaya in the world and pairing it with a jar of Shuckle moonshine he made himself.  As for me, though, I've never been one for seafood.  I wonder if Sawsbuck venison changes flavor based on the season, though...
Oddly enough I'd go for the litteral ice cream cones
as soon as I heard Mikey talking about eating pumpkaboo I immediately imagined Mikey cutting open a wild pumpkaboo saying PUMPKIN PIE!
You are trusting the pokedex entries... Do you know how wrong the pokedex can be?! I wouldn't be surprised if all these mons tasted horrible!
Bro forgot about tatsugiri
Now what would you drink???  Sinistea - only the owner can enjoy the tea
yeaaaa as someone who's first pokemon game was crystal i knew that slowpoke was coming
Even if eggsecute is seeds I mean I love seeds I would eat eggsecute
Slow poke noooooo
I'd eat every pokemon on this list  Plus I'd probably try some of one of the dragon types.  Dragonite looks like it's got some meat on it and in curious how it'd taste
Would you eat/release a shiny miltank
I feel like this is weird for you guys but I'm a bone guy i eat chicken bones and nuggets wo marowhacks skull and bone and cubones meat too
Vanillite and its evolutions
Blaziken may be my favourite Pokèmon, but DAMN i'd totally try Kentucky Fried Combusken
I'm coming up with a drink, right here, right now. Take some juice from a shuckle and pour it into a glass. Water it down and add a few drops of bounsweet sweat. Place a cleaned-out applin slice on the rim, add some ice created by a glaceon (specifically glaceon because I love eevee and its eeveelutions, so really, any ice-type's ice move will work), add a straw and enjoy!
What about the ice cream pokemon
Please no one say garduvwar or loppunny
With spoinks dex entry being what it is I'm gonna assume bacon is an incredibly common food source in the pokemon world bc all youd have to do to get a spoink prepped for the butcher is stop it from bouncing
“I’ll eat his mum though” Micheal 2022
And bulbasaurs bulb
Sus🤨
Purplecliffe be like “tsarina same reason as Mikey but when it’s her time of mon-“
mandjtv i have a question which pokemon will you keep in a zoo?
3:23 what u mean by that
pm7
How Could You Forget vanillite
That got - Morbid   Edit : though I would see abt trying chicorita
Probably  magickarp
Drowsee
Fidough is just bread in a dog
Cherry like balls 8:05
I would eat lopunny😉
Mostly kalamari is pig bo
I would eat a blacken
And I wanted to die..... HAHA IT IS I
Don't hurt the winter sawsbuck and we'll be fine.
I'd love it if Pokemon were real because then the grass types could help the crops on my family's farm to grow faster. Also my friend and I could run Pokemon gyms.   Also for any endangered Pokemon that you wish to eat just hatch more of the pokemon you eat and raise them therefore the population doesn't change. Unless you want to go overboard and do a nicer thing by breeding and releasing them to raise the population.
He mised the f ing ice creem pokemon🤦🏻‍♂️
😱😨😳😱😨😳😱😨😱😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😳😱😨😱😨😱😳😨😱😳😨😱😳😳😱😨😳😨😱😳😨😳😨😳😳😳😳😳😳🤔😳😳
Carbink. I'd imagine the crystals would taste pretty good especially if they were broken up into pieces to make rock candy. I haven't really read into its dex entries in full detail though, so I'd go in tasting the crystals blind and hope for the best and keep my fingers crossed about them tasting good. Edit:  Well I change my mind now about eating Carbink after reading the many dex entries mentioning Carbink using a beam that it fires out from the gem in its chest. Yeah I think I can cross eating Carbink off my list now.
I would like like to see a video, of him and lockstin talking about what animals in the Pokemon world, they'd eat and why.
Is nobody gonna talk about the thumbnail change
Piloswine is a literal Mammoth
I agree
One of Miltank’s Pokédex entries says that people who drink Miltank’s milk look a lot like Miltank, unless you plan on becoming what you swore to destroy, I’d just stick with the steak.
G max alcremie is just A CAKE
I fell that bublasaur would taste like a good salad [sorry about spelling 😅]
All in favor of killing a milltank if you see one say I
I'd never be able to eat swinub. They're SO freaking precious.
Boogie fans
Koridon will be SCRUMSHS
Shuckle's juice must be eaten with nuts too Whose mom ?? Ayoo
i'm going to make a song of mickey  loving pumpkin pie
Late to this but what about garganacl not eat it but have it make salt for you
I would eat Golem without the rock/shell
Did he say Vanillite i don,t think he said vanillite
Here me out Aceus it is just a big deer
Pumpkin spice is not from pumpkin. It's just abbreviation of pumpkin pie spice or PP spice. Still blends well with pumpkin taste.
Oinkilon
"Altough, I can't remember what Grass is like. Is it blue?" Two green trees in The background: "Well, guess I'm not here anymore?"
note like half the pokemon he wants to kill he doesnt have to
Tbh I would try eating Espathra, I've had ostrich burgers before and they're pretty good
also vileploom cuz yes i think it kinda tastes like rebombie's pollen not gloom it looks like that its a poisonus flower with a face
bulbasoar ivisoar and venosoar i know they are poison types but the pollen on venosoar and ivisoar is i guess tastes like rebombee's pollen and the bulb on bulbasoar look kinda tasty i guess idk
Bambi
K L A W F S T I C K
Combusken could be Buffalo Wild Wings because it’s spicy
3:19 Bruh I choked on my sandwich from laughing at this
What about tatsugiri it’s literally sushi
Zubat/Noibat:Are we jokes to you?   *COVID 19 walks in*  Zubat/Noibat: *in Utter Shock from Guilt*
Shuckles juice sounds hilarious
he didnt do the ice crème cones
The first time that he wasn't annoyed at grunty boy 😂
Bounsweet sounds like during summer and when its hot and sweaty you can put them bucket worth of cold water and tou can get your sweet drink.
For me,I eat a Garchomp call me insane.
The new thumbnail tho💀
How can you not like lamb?  I had lamb for the first time at 14 and realized that instead of petting then I should have been shoving them into my mouth.
i've had kangaroo meat, it was quite good. also ostritch, very nice
6:42 How DARE you say you will eat Pidove, Tranquill and Unfezant?! If you do, I will make sure that I turn you into a Pokemon eaten by Pyroar, and feed you to one
Smoliv
6:37 Based
"shuckle's juice" Me: Wait a minute lol
NO GRUNTY BOI!! DON'T PLAY LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!
I can't imagine the dislikes😂
Top tear
nah im gonna tell on you mikey
I think it was mentioned people would wat magikarp. But a vegetarian so what do I know about meat? XD
Wow. Pokémon are delicious    Read more
6:38 noooo pidove is my favourite pokemon
Search up how to cook pokemon 😢
Why do I think koridon would taste good like ancient meat sounds pretty awsome
THUMBNAIL???
I think you forgot tatsugiri Like, unless you don’t like sushi, tatsugiri is just living sushi. Kill it, cook it a little and there you have a delicious meal
miltank desirves it
I'm surprised that he forgot to say vanillite vanillux vanillish
Mikey: I won’t eat Bambi though. But I’ll eat his mom. Me:🤨📸but Bambi doesn’t ha- toI know never mind
No way morelull and shiinotic aren’t the Pokémon world’s version of psychedelic mushrooms
Who here reamber the original thumbnail
I want to send you a pokemon card of snowy form castform
unfezant is the best regional bird
Gogout milk is delicious acording to the anime
Lechonk
Balls🤓-
in the hisui days a alpha gyarados would've fed the whole village i would be happy to eat a gyarados since it looks like a catfish and i love those and of course magikarp too
Septiel fruits
Anyone notice the new sketched thumbnail for this vid? It looks nice, but it’s got me curious
Clauncher line is shrimp and I love shrimp so I would eat it
What about when oinkalone
i havent seen any of this yet im still on the ad but if lopunny or gardivior are on here i swear to god
If he said fidough or dachsbun..the entire internet would appear outside his house to obliterate him…including me.
I would eat requaza
I would like to eat miltank's meat but not its milk tho the pokedex said that if you drink too much miltank's milk, you BECOME a miltank
ya missed combee
I would eat Malamar for the reason you want to eat miltank I would enjoy punishing it for being evil.
Literally Farfetchd is one of my fav pokemon I was shocked when they were endengared
I have tried a bit of swordfish meat and it was good
Vanillite evolution line, maybe smolive and it’s evolution line, possibly sinistea, daushbun
Vaporeon is a Edible mon, hes literally just water
My favorite Pokémon is Farfetch'd. Even though it's my favorite I feel like it would taste good. Humans eat duck so it's not so bad
Celery
Cinnamon, Citrus, and Peppermint are safe to eat and also used as bug repellents, so Petalil being a safe tea and a bug repellent is not too Farfetch'd. No mention of the literal Ice Cream cones with faces?
Well, I can never play Pokemon the same way again. But I used to catch certain pokemon for wonder trade and name them things like "Your Lunch" or "Your Snack" and other meals. Often they were of the seafood variety, I mean water type variety.
he changed the video profile but it looks better
Thanks for the pig facts: Immediately eats oinkalone.
what about oinkalogne
HE CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
Nom nom nom 😋🤤
miltank nipples turn in to hot dogs
I like gator meat so gator and croc Pokémon could be tasty.
Torchic for chicken nuggets
No it’s yellow
There are literally no real animals in the pokemon world, so you cant exxpect everyone to be vegan, can you
kangaroo meat is so good
Arceus and gardevoir
Eat oinkolongne
How about quaxel its a dancing duck
I cant eat Pokemon          Im Pokeat intolerant
9:47 you know that pumpkin spice doesn't contain any pumpkin right?
Mmmmm…Kanto Fried Combusken!
I think u missed Drowzie
For calamari try omanyte and omastar
3:30 I’ve had that exact brand of bison meat it was delicious
Bro became 100 percent anti social when he spoke about milk tank
I would eat hoot hoot
When you said elektross  I was so sad my favourite electric type nooooooo!
Grunty boi go and touch grass
What happened to Oinkalougne for the pigs
Fun fact: the reason Farfetched is call that is cause in Japan seeing a duck with a leek is farfetched
Tatsugiri is sushi
gamer grunty boi
Pumpkin Ramin
I would eat all of tinkaton because corviknight deserves better
Gruny boi is a literal god
mikey:grumpig is the most like a normal pig Oinkologne: am i a joke to you
Yeah. I think Blaziken would kick your butt if you try to eat it.🔥🔥
YES!!!!!!!! KILL MILTANK FOR FOOD.🍔🍔
I feel like lechonk would be relatively tasty prosciutto or even some delectable bacon. Sure they’re small, but they are relatively abundant in S&V. They’re also fairly plump, so I’d wager their meat is relatively juicy and fatty. Perhaps not the healthiest cut of pork in that regard, but I think we can all agree that a nice fatty cut of pork is delectable on occasion.  And if ethics is an issue, may I direct you to large scale chicken farms in the real world, and how they torment and slaughter millions of chickens just to keep the world fed. Yes, standards for chicken farms have gotten better over the years, but I think humane animal farm practices are not maintained well by all the big corporations simply because supply and demand won’t allow for a slower, more humane life for the chickens. This probably extends to other animal farms as well, but I’m honestly unfamiliar with most farm practices.
7:08 I need this kangaroo meat story also I once tried reindeer at around Christmas time so I felt like I was eating Rudolf but I actually liked it.
I am a wine gal so I would gladly try some Shuckle brewed wine
Shuckle juice
Squirtle you remove the shell arms and head then you put the body in their delicious meal
If anyone eats appletun I will come to there house and kill then like who will eat that cute guy 😢😢😢😢😢
New channel: GruntyBoyGaming
1:23 "endangered pokemon" My brain: BREED AS MANY FARFETCH AS YOU CAN WE NEED TO RE POPULATE THE SPECIES
Vanilite evo line
I'm down to do a ritual and get the ghost part out of those delectable pumpkins heck I have a a set to do the ritual in my home and can easily get one of my other friends to help with the ritual, I AM DOWN MY GUY.
Grunty boi grass is actually orange,please know your grass colors,though I don’t know if grass is a sauce,is it a sauce?
What about goat pokemon? The new Scarlet and Violet Pokemon and any exotic Pokemon.
You forgot to mention Magicarp!
What about Dashbun it is just fried dough
I will say I understand about Lechonk being too small, but in the Philippines (and I’m sure in Spain and many other Hispanic countries), pigs are turned into a delicacy called “Lechon”; with one of my favourite variations is “Lechon Kawali” (“Lechonk-awali”). So every time I hear Lechonk, I will always think of Lechon Kawali, so I’d definitely eat Lechonk
Some pokémon I'd eat: Torchic Miltank (Milk and Beef) Applin Slowpoke  Nacl Shuckle Magikarp Fidough (Bread)
Pumpkin resoto?
i dont know why but i think goldeen would taste good if prepared properly
Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't people eat magikarp in the anime
Isn’t blasiken like self cooking chicken
the subtitles think your saying "gory teams for events"
pumpkin soup or pumpkin bread
Vanillite gannillisf
vanilux
I eat Bison all the time and cook the tritatiol way with my family and friends on my uncles birthday
The egg on top of Venusaur
Mikey enjoys the finer things in life... including The All You Can Eat Miltank Buffet. Mikey would eat them into extinction just to spite Whitney... and then maybe he'd eat her Miltank too.
Dis you change the thumbnail? Very sneaky...
The second time and watch this video I noticed that the thumbnails drawn😮
Personally I would love to try Rayquaza
I wouldn't want to drink piss, even if it tasted good.
the possesed tea from sword and shield
3:57 per nom nom perfect miltank oy stop crying Whitney
also slowpke tails grow back
GARDEAVOUIR VAPOREON mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I’ll eat a Bambi burger or a Bambi hotdog yes I’m a savage🦌😈
Grunty boi forgetting Grass is a grunty boi move
It's actually fascinating how much of the food facts are covered in Pokedex entries! I love the subtle world building that we get through the 'dex, it's great.
2:43 what about oinkilogne
Rabbit meat is pretty good why not bunneary or bunnalby
Pokémon food ideas:  Roasted farfetch’d with leek   Tauros steaks  Slowpoke stew  Slowpoke curry  Scovillain sauce  Oinkolonge and gogoat cheese sandwich  Berry Smoothie   Shuckle juice  Bulbasaur bulb  Vanillite ice cream Gogoat ice cream Miltank ice cream  Miltank steak  Bouffalant burger  Grilled Barraskewda with fries  Grilled spearow  Combusken wings  Petilil tea   Klawf claws with lemon and lime  Arboliva oil  Seared Basculin  Fried Veluza
Magikarp!
Bro missed the ice cream
Nice
No guys, he’s becoming a game theory. He’s looking at every word every sentence everything in the books everything in the aaaaaaaáAaäå
I'll eat lovedisc because I hate love and I'll put lovedisc to extinction because it brings love
I'll eat lovedisc
die miltank
I would eat hoothoot. I mean, have you seen how big it it's like a giant meatball.
How to get inf food. Ditto
SO CRUEL!!!!😢
I hate how much meat is in this video I ain’t fully vegan but still
You can eat Dacshbun
PeTA: A GUide Hoew tO bEE vEgAN For PokEMoM scaRRleT and ViolEEt
Quaxly literally comes with a broth
Did you know that some people say Magikarp and Gyarados can actually be pretty tasty their meat is actually pretty good and I would love to eat Magikarp and Gyarados and Octillery not only because I was good octopus meat most likely I also hate it along with no tank you're not alone there
You might like pumpkin flavoured Oreos
"I am not eating bambi, but the mum though" < basically the plot of bambi.
Uhhhhhh aren't pliowswime mammoths😅
mmmm a pikacu
Drowzee better be on this list.
FunFact: Caffeine exists in coffee beans and tea leaves because it's a toxin to insects... so Based on Petilil's dex entry mentioning its use as a bug repellent further reinforces its similarity to Real World Tea!
Klawf is just a rock why do you think it's the rock titan and not water and they use it's claws as a season for food which in my case would be good
"We do a little seance we have the spirit move on in peace and I get peace to, peices of pumpkin pie!" I loved this part of the video (Might have messed up the quote but still funny)
Vegans watching this video be like 🙃
I imagine Dragon meat would be pretty tough and tastes. So probably Cyclizar Tails. Besides, that's pretty badass to eat a piece of a dragon. Speaking of, as morbid as it sounds...Dragonite and Salamance wings? Garchomp is a land shark, so basically Garchomp fins? And tail. Goodra is just goo no thanks. Maybe use Kyurem ice in my whiskey XD
Shuckle:“WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WHINE”
You said that you would eat miltank but would you SUCK ON HIM?!😂😂😂
Good thing your not Markiplier.
Not s Herbert. Sherbert
The Whole Vanillite line are literal ice cream cones. Count me in. Vanilluxe s Herbert, sound delicious.
Years after saying he would eat sasbuck (pardon my spelling) he goes on to talk about how many enthusiasts it has.
What about the Icecream Pokemon?
UNFEASENT IS MY 9TH FAVORITE NORMAL TYPE MICKEY!
Idk what it’s called but the evo of ducklett
If lechonk is too small, get its evolution out on a platter
Not vanilite or vaniluxe!!!
I think rather than eat milkery and alcemie maybe just ask them for their cream
Maybe don’t eat inkay or Melmart because they are squids. Yes but they are also psychic types I think.
I think definitely eat shelder but don’t eat clampearl or cloister
I think that this whole video is hilarious but I don’t think we should be eating the pumpkin Pokémon partially because I’m a big fan of gourgeist seeing as it was one of my very first Pokémon in Pokémon go, which is a Pokémon game that I particularly love
I love petilil it’s an awesome Pokémon, but if it was willing to give leaves for that, I definitely would take it
Don’t eat morelull but do eat shiinotic
Don’t eat unfezant it’s an awesome Pokémon
I think maybe eating sawsbuck is a bit going too far but I think I understand the rest
Waiter: how much whipped cream would you like on your pumpkin pie sir. Mikey: the entire Alcremie.  Waiter: 😅 wat
If you kill milktank do you have ifinite moo moo milk
Pumpkin is life pumpkin is love
How dare you eat a slowpoke!!!
3:42 UM ACTUALLY!! Milktank is a DIARY cow so you can only eat it if it’s “retired” meaning it doesn’t work to make milk anymore and it looks like from the anime it’s nowhere close to being “retired”
Although none of its Dex entries mention eating it, arceus
Yeah grass is blue I saw it 10 years ago
Miltanks dhelmise get it😂😂😅😅
nah bro grass is purple... wait leeme check............ EW
OH MY GOD I too love calamari!
Swirlix is acctually a dog that ate so many sweets it became one.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
“I’ll eat his mom though”
Imagine this: A plate full of Tatsugiri, Magikarp and Qwilfish sushi alongside a bowl of soupy and slurpable Farfetch'd ramen, fresh, spicy Combusken wings, Avgolemeno with fresh Combusken, vegetable broth, Chansey eggs, lemon juice and a drizzle of Arboliva oil and a cheesy burger, with the buns being made for Fidough and high quality wagyu Miltank. And for desert, there's Dachsbun donuts with puree made from the smalper head of Cherubi and Gourgiest pie with Alcremie cream (the term Alcremie cream sounds so wrong)
Magikarp
Caffeine is a natural bug repellent. And I am addicted to it.
ARLIGHT GUYS GUYS HEAR ME OUT lopunny
I bet if the vegan teacher sees this she’ll freak out
I think you would like deez nuts!
if the vegan teacher sees hahaha
And not even the parts that fall of or are anandamide objects that the Pokémon carry
Your eating 🍽 Pokémon
I have the Raycon gaming headphones, and they are perfect. I listen with them daily.
This is being wrote before the video it's a ad but miltanks dosage nipples
As the vegetarian, I find this hilarious. Also sign me up for Bombee Puffs. Don't know how where who or why I felt the need to mention my vegetarian status.
I would honestly eat the insects of the poke on world, But only the land ones. Just extract venom and poison, cook it properly and you got a crunchy centiscorch burger
oh wow, this, this video..
When you said fruits and veggies, I was like what Pokémon are fruit
hoot hoot
milcery is just milk
Vanillite
Mmmm pumpkin spiced souls of the damned
This is the Sinnoh branch of peta! We demand you stop this madness at once! Im sure we can find some dumb-butt excuse to take this down!
Whitney gave you as well as a whole generation a hate boner for miltank huh?
Klawfs a rock type, I personally wouldn’t like to eat a rock
I agree with mikey so much our tastes are so similar especially when he goes on about pumpkin I also adore pumpkin!
Mikey:*sees miltank* Mikey at the end of the day:”that steak was delicious”
I would eat Oinkolonge.
He wants to sukle on the shuckle
Maractus and cacnea are potentially on the list. One of Maractus' dex entries says their seeds are full of nutrients and are a good food source in the desert. Cactus pears are also delicious, as well as the cactus plant itself after removing the spikes and cooking it (nopales) Lickitung and lickilicky might also be on that list. Now hear me out but beef tongue is a very delicious and tender meat that is underutilized, which is a huge shame. I know the dex entries say the saliva is very sticky or corrosive but I feel it's okay to eat once the tongue is removed, properly cleaned, then cooked. Besides it's like Mikey's point with miltank, lickitung and lickilicky are awful and I get to enjoy my meal as well as their demise. I also want combee honey and roasted sunkerns to snack on
AS A BOSTONIAN, MIKEY TRYING TO DO A BOSTON ACCENT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE SEEN ALL WEEK
5.995th in the comments
i belive grass is red, maybe purple its been a while
Sceptile little balls
I swear I've watched this video longer ago than 4 months
i wonder what fidough would be like
this was a worrying but very entertaining video.
What about the fish sushi pokemon😂?
Fidough
I would eat a ditto, make it transform into an edible pokemon that I know the taste of and see if its similar or just tastes like ditto and maybe ditto tastes like jelly you never know. But if it does seem to copy the tastes of other pokemon then I would have alcreamie, vanillite and milktank all in one on the go. Its basically a portable ice cream or vending machine.
you forgot about gardovoir! What were you thinking!
Im a vegetarian… but alcreamie isn’t meat 😈😈😈
3:11 Mikey: Venison is deer meat. Persona 4 players: And I took that personally.
Speaking of venison, I'd (at least try to) eat Xerneas. Venison that LITERALLY REVIVES THE DEAD is sure to taste good, right?
I’d probably eat fidough and dauchbun
When I told my mom that people eat Pokémon, my mom was like EW! DISGUSTING! Then few days later when I showed my mom Gygantamax Kingler I said Dose It Look Tasty? And She said Yes,I Also Kinda Want To Eat Him. Then I Said Few Days Ago Didn’t You Said Eating Pokémon Is Disgusting? Then she said Oh, You Still Remember I Said That and I was like OF COURSE, IT WAS LIKE THERE DAYS AGO.
Go to choose from girl, Pokémon
S-scovalian. Why not scovalian :( it’s a literal pepper
My question is what about the legendary‘s because how ho-oh must taste so good
My mom's dad cook some pretty good dear if you want some you can come over the only problem is that I live in Mississippi
Fun video. I'm surprised you didn't mention Sinistea and Polteageist (probably spelled their names wrong). Or is there some weird curse thing that happens if you drink their tea?
Hes missing vanilite and vanilish
Bruh... this made me want to eat these foods soooo much... and plus im going to eat! So ill get to eat some of these! Probably... maybe... I don't know...
13:35 save for later
This video is a goldmine for out of context clips 😂😂😂
10:53 *_M E A T_*
Why the hate for milktank?  Moo moo milk was such an epic design.
TOUCH GRASS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💀
"Arrokuda seems to have tendency to get caught in things' throats."  No son, that's because Cramorant doesn't chew its food.  Methinks it shares the Pac Man Frog's lack of restraint.
2:39 one word, Oinkologne.
7:41 Fun fact: caffeine is a natural bug repellent
Pumpkaboo and goregeist: k!ll people for fun. Mikey:I don't care, i'm gonna eat them
If you can eat bear meat you can eat snorlax and beware
This is insane and I love it 😂
I would much rather eat Pignite than Piloswine, simply for the fact that there is VERY little risk of getting fur on my Pignite chops. Can you imagine the amount of shaving they'd have to do, just to get ready to butcher a Piloswine? No thank you.
This was probably made before scarlet and violet but I would 100% eat oinkolonge preferably male but female also works
Shiny sneasel I’m lovin it
The fact that shuckle juice is mixed with berries and its body fluids is unappetizing
We need an edited version of this with Drowzee in it.
Mmmmmmm tasty Pokémon steaks mmmmmm....
The vega  teacher watching this video
what about pansage's tufts? they are known to relieve stress.
I don’t know about you guys but I could really go for some azumarill. That is because rabbit meat does exist and it’s good. Also azumarills ability is thick fat. That must mean it has a bunch of juicy meat.
I’d use haunter’s horns to make into a seasoning as long it isn’t uh poisonous ☠️
All the turtle pokemon  turtle soup
Said dex entry for shuckle also stated that it's juice is partially made from it's blood.
i think morpeko's food ball pouch things would be nice it literally ate them in the anime and smiled so i would have morpeko puff bag commpany
grunty boy is now a gamer
in the latias and latios movie latias turns into a girl and kisses Ash so
i would eat magikarp
This video was amzing :) But I wouldn‘t eat Appletun because he is one of my absolut favourite pokemon :)
What about tasugui that is just fish and can become sushi
Not tatsugiri?
I will eat his mom though XD
My number one that I'd eat from scarlet and violet is tatsugiri. Just looking at it makes me hungry for salmon nigiri
With technicality the steaks in scarlet and violet are made from miltanks and then imported. So it made it technically.
I would eat magikarp if you know you know
Eat Tatsugiri, it is literally sushi, the Tatsugiri interactive voices even say sushee.
I'd eat magic karp
who here has wanted to comment multiple times on one MandJTV video but thought it would make you wierd?
Who wants an update of this video after Scarlet and violet came out?
Combee…
Tatsughiry
0:18 Why do I have the feel that was Gardevoir?
I know this is going to sound weird but, I dislike wagyu beef. I like most other cow products, just not wagyu. I find it gross in both texture and flavor.
I'd love to taste Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist based Pumpkin Pasties. Pumpkaboo Pasties.
I know you really don't like Miltank, which I get. I definitely understand the hate it gets, but that also makes me think it would be an interesting challenge if you could beat Pokemon Heargold or Soulsiver....using only Miltank!   As much as we all hate it, it does have some solid stats, so I'd like to see this challenge
I think that Appletun, being a reptile, would shed it's skin.
Miltank can be found north of Olivine City in Gold and Silver which is based on the real-world Kobe, as in Kobe beef. So, yes,  Miltank is most likely wagyu and delicious.
Petition for Mikey to react to Bumbles McFumbles' video going over Kanto Pokemon with potential to be a good pet
I would like to try honey made by a Combee colony.
Vanillux line.
Dachsbun looks pretty delicious.  Vanilish et al turns out to be just covered in frost, not ice cream at all, but it might make for a good snowcone.  How about Sinistea?  Is that drinkable?  And while an exeggcute is not technically eggs, I hear it pairs well with the meat of a bagon.  Hard to beat a breakfast of bagon and eggs.
The Nacli line produces infinite salt with which to season and preserve the meats.
This has got to be one of the funniest videos you’ve made ever. I dont know if it was intentional or not, but I laughed so much
Shuckle’s juice is literally made of it’s BODY LIQUID does that mean the juice is berries+shuckles uhm..pee?
Guess what part of Machoke I’d try
why not octilery or alolamola
Max Alcremie!
Oh and about the logic that I would eat Pokémon ,I hate, I would eat charizard, greninja and this wrestler cat ( in German it is called fuegro) but I don’t know it’s English name but I hate these starters
I am vegetarian and looking this video without aggressions witch is pretty surprising
in pokemon journeys ash fights g-max alcrimme and pikachu just eats the cream ( bad spelling )
Kangaroo is a really lean meat so it's easy to overcook it, it's really good when done right.
If you would eat milktank would you also eat it’s nipples?
why did i think he would add lopunny or vaporeon :l
i acutally think the elektross line wouldnt be that edible, seeing that they are more lamprey then eels
combee
Gardevoir and Lopunny 😏😏
Pffft this is so dark and funny at the same time.
Klefki 🤤 🤤 🤤
Bambi
Are you the man who hunter ban is mum
I think magikarp would have some really deliciously juicy meat jus thinking about it I’m hungry😋🤤
I would like to add arceus to this list I mean godly meat would probably have some health benefits and taste good
I setting my sights on fidough   ITS LITERALLY A PUPPY MADE OF PASTRIES
surprised pika for the fact that oinklogne wasn't on this list
Good you'll drink and eatthe legendary milk and meat from miltank
What about sinister and polteagist?
I won't eat Bambi,but I'd eat his mom
Oinklogne
Just read torchick pokedex entry
i think i would eat venusaur
Pokémon: people eat or at least use to eat Pokémon Me: did people use to eat chardet or other humanoid Pokémon 😥
Also, the only reason team rocket got in trouble for cutting off the slow poke tails was because they didn’t have a license.
You can now add: Fidough Dachsbun  Capsakid Veluza Oinkologne  Nacli Garganacl Toedscool Toedscruel
Scovillian spice would be good. I also would mind a fidough..
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IVE WATCHED THIS VIDEO AND SOMEHOW I QUOTED “if it’s dead.” FROM MALAMAR’S SEGMENT EXACTLY AS HE SAID IT
Tauros is a cow. Toros is Spanish for bull. (Or whatever female cow is)
Charazard meat would be tasty because just kill it and because it’s literally on fire it would already be cooked
U are sick person for eating pumpkins you monster
I thought you would like to eat vanilluxe
The thumbnail makes you look like you're laughing maniacally
People eat crocodile and alligator, so similar Pokémon would be good. You have to try croc tail at least once. Tarantula meat when cooked is comparable to crab. So I bet a lot of bug Pokémon would be tasty. Not the poison ones, but, yeah.
Pideoto
9:26 It be cool if pokemon make a form of this pokemon with the berry  it grow
Most of the fish Pokemon would probably be tasty. Whiscash is a catfish, which is delicious. You mention Malamar but not Octillery? Octopus is delicious. I also hear that shark is delicious, so I'd probably try Sharpedo. And I hear that whale is tasty, so I'd try Wailord. I'd try Qwilfish, but only if a master pufferfish chef prepares it.
I understand why it's weird, but I don't think it's weird... seriously, I've seen people with pet chicken and I love eating chicken.
did anyone elce notice the pumpkin dog treats XD
I feel like there's a lot more Pokemon you could eat. Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Pidgeot, Oddish, Chikorita (if you know, you know), Furret, Politoed, Sunkern, Linoone, Seedot, Cacnea, Whiscash, Kricketot, Kricketune, Combee, Buneary, Lopunny, Audino, Seismitoad, Maractus, Vanillite, Vanillish, Vanilluxe, Shelmet, Frogadier, Gogoat, Wishiwashi, Mudsdale, Scorbunny, Raboot, Wooloo, Dubwool, Clobbopus, Oinkologne, Dauchsbun, Smoliv, Dolliv, Arboliva, Nacli, Naclstack, Garganacl, Scovillain, and Tatsugiri.
Now that Scarlet and Violet are out, I think Mikey would add Oinkolonge to the pigs.
The Vanillite line is literally Iced Cream. I imagine it’s rather delicious  Sinistea and Polteageist are also pretty self explanatory.
given that pokemon will churn out a ghost pokemon from near anything........ i can totally see a ghost dark malamar haunting you for turning it into food. if i cant eat the vanillite line (i loves me some vanilla soft serve ice cream) that nasty abomination is canna get tossed in the snow cruncher to become iced water...... (honestly the vanillite line is for me = what miltank is to mike).
You forgot magikarp
You say you don’t know of snover’s berries but it was mentioned in your sword and shield crazy dex entries video
Pumpkin soup
They should add a game called pokemon: Crimson and Purple
I’m sure I speak for the 5 other people who like unfeazent when I say how dare you
I am playing pokemon right now surprise trade i got a cherubi exactly as mikey said cherubi
mikey you are aware swirlix and slurpuff are dogs right?
...Hail nah
Lopunny
What about the pokemon that are just straight up ice cream?
I would eat lopunny cuz rabbit soup tastes really good for me😋
Hmmmm who else after the video ended wondered if Machamp would taste good?
MICKEY:SAUSAGE NIPPLES
bulbasaur bulb
Mudkip, Marshtomp, and Swampert would be delicious! 😋😋😋
Ice cream Pokémon vanellite line
How did the ice cream cone not get mentioned?
When I first saw oyster muscle, I was disturbed because this one piece looked like a neck
bro this guy litterly said ''Il eat its mom''
Um. They don’t normally cook milk cow in world so I doubt they will use milktank that way.
I am so suprised PM7 hasn't seen and reacted to this video, i mean it be a great reaction, and seeing PM7 aka John take on Pokemon he'd eat lol
I WOuLd eAT a DrAgALge iN suSHi
Grunty boi’s R is no longer rocket, it’s raycon.
Oinkilogne?
What about  allcreme
5:22 go touch some grass, grunty boy
Bro just the jokes hit different XD
It's strange that Slowpoke tail is being served in Alolan cuisine.
Why wouldn't you eat the literal ice cream cones?
👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤🤬😤🤬😤🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹☠️☠️☠️👺☠️👺👺☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺😤😤😤🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

I think magicarp would be delicious because I love fish so much it’s so good
Mikey and pumpkins is like me and raspberries. To bad there aren’t any raspberry Pokemon *yet.*
E A T L E C H O N K
Now im faking mad
You forgot some seafood like shrimp and salmon
mew
Grunty Boi Makes Lots Of Sponsorships
10:37
What about hootie he's like 40 lb of pure chicken meat 🍖🍖
You're probably hoping in generation 10 after eating so much melting that the Pokedex entry says this Pokemon is almost extinct
bold of me to say this, but... bugs have more protein per pound and are more efficient to farm. So, as someone who has tried and even enjoyed some bug dishes before, here are the bug type pokemon I would eat: 1) Nincada Cicadas are genuinely quite good, and very easy and delicious when oven roast or deep fried. 2) Sewaddle if you've never had stir fried mealworms, you haven't lived. cheers 3) Skorupi ...Bear with me. big body arachnids actually taste a lot like crab, and are by far one of my favorite bugs i have eaten. I KNOW i know it's mainly a poison type, but I do not care. i do not care, i want to try a skorupi.
Gigantamax alcremie….I LOVE CAKE
You missed Magikarp.
11:45 Mikey: and klawf Me: NO CLAWF
I wouldn't eat the meat, but can you imagine how much oil Snoralx's fat could make? You could fry your food for like a year with that amount
13:23 can you tell how much of a tard I am that a blurry background shot of Alain puts a smile on my face lol
There are three Pokemon I would include on this list that aren't here in the x and y anime Ski-Doo is responsible for the most delicious cheeses and ice-creams of the Kalos region so I would drink skidoo milk in the most efficient white meat source in the Pokemon world is Hoot Hoot it weighs over 40 lb when it hatches what a single rotisserie hoot hoot would be enough to feed your family for over a week
Vanillite!!
I want a Pokémon farming/restaurant game where we can only cook with Pokémon and plants shown in the games and shows, because there are actual olive trees that the Smoliv lives around, so...
I'd try some Shuckle Wine
Vegans watching this be like:😭😫🤧🤮💀
I think Tatsugiri would be good sushi
THE ICE CREAM POKÉMON
Waiting for Bacon Steve the Pokes
I would look like a woman
You missed ash, human meat is amazing/j plz fbi that was a joke
Primeape would be tast... UHH MONKEY MEAT. The best kind. I had in in Mysterianadia and it was bussin'
Sus sus
People eat reptiles so maybe krookodile or squirtle
Scrambled exacute tho…
i think team rocket didnt much like drinking that shuckle juice.....    I mean if they actually catched all of the pokemlns that were atracted to the juice it may be good
You forgot the most tasty alakazam
WTH is grass
But shuckles juice is also part of his blood those berries mixed with his blood to to make it full liquid
Bro just called piloswine and mamoswine pigs💀
DO NOT EAT SMOLIVE YOU MONSTER
The two pokemon I would have in real life are Teddyursa and Blissy.
A lot of pokemon as food options open up as well when you consider other cultures, like horse, camel, alligator, whale, seals, even insects! Outside of obvious pokemon like steel and rock types, almost anything can probably be eaten to some degree if people are willing to try lol
I could definitely go for some Veluza fillets or Huntail sushi. Saying that, I probably just could eat Tatsugiri, anyways.
I would love to eat Rolycoly
You missed conbee honey
bassculegion would be yummy
Oinkologne is the perfect pig pokemon to eat now that we know of it's existence
WHAT ABOUT Vanilluxe Aand Vanillish!? PROBABLY THE MOST SCRUMPTOUS AND DELICIOUS POKEMON!!!! ♥
6:26 took eating **** to a whole new level😂
Yeah. I agree that Miltank is the absolute worst. So I would eat it. And my mom loves pumpkin spiced stuff too.
What about magikarp?
What about all the turtle Pokemon?
eat forfech
As a New England resident I will say this...... you indeed said Chowdah right
WHAT ABOUT SINISTEA
In the Pokémon world not even the vegetarians can get away without eating Pokémon
3:10 WHaY DO YOU EAT RAINDEER DUdE!
I agree the only one I'd try is Dauchbun
About the bug repel thing- bugs really hate cinamon but ifs still great in tea.  (If you have ants coming from a whole in the ground, circle it with cinamon and theyll stop coming. Then you can patch it without killing the ants!)
My lechonk evolved into a big oinkalong and it look delicious idk wdym its too small this is so much pig
You forgot squirtle
9:46 bro is the exact oppisite of my dad lol
make an new every poke  you would eat video ,becuase theres more pokemon......
How you have so many dad jokes and not a dad? Lord the overload you'll have should you choose to be one in the future.
This video was kinda sus
Me wants shuckle juice🤤
so we’re not gonna talk about how he said he was gonna eat  deerlimgs mommy
And some of them you can eat guilt-free if they learn Recover, such as Appletun and Alcremie, so bonus points for those
Just gonna put out there that if you haven't had a camel burger, you're missing out. If you find it offered somewhere, definitely give it a try.
This video this makes me hungry
i know it doesnt count but what about human its really like really good!
Now there’s bread Pokémon people!!!!🍞🥖🥨🥐❤️❤️❤️
3 Pokémon I would eat I would eat miltank because it’s a cow ,second I would eat diglet because it looks like a hot dog,and lastly I would eat garde-
I've also heard of people eating snakes, gators and let's not forget those famous chocolate covered bugs. 😆 so Ekans, sandaconda, a fair number of reptile starters and an ENDLESS supply of bugs are all possible options
Pidoughhhhh
You know jigglypuff is delicious
John is gonna be mad
Yes, but I just found out there were real animals, bugs, fish, and birds too!
In Wishiwashi's pokedex entry for Pokémon Moon, it is specifically said that it is "weak and notably tasty". So, if you like anchovies, you can totally eat Wishiwashi, as long as it doesn't school form in the kitchen.
What about oinkloge
would you eat tasugiri
I mean I’d be down to eat some Appletun skin, because it is literally an Apple Pie, or an Apple Turnover. Although a Miltank burger with moomoo milk sounds really good.
Oinkologne. It's literally just a pig.
Ayo what did he say
Personally, i would eat gardevoirs a-
how else would they get meat?
I believe that octillery would  be a tasty addition!
I'm not into reptile meat per se. Never had it. But I think I'd try any type of dragon meat just to see what it tastes like. Especially a dragonite. Looks fatty.
miltake's milk turns you into miltank!
I wonder if Scovilllian would be the best spicy food.
Me when he said : I woud eat miltank evry single day good
My dad can make pumpkin waffles😂😂
You forgot Scovillian and Capsakid the chilli peppers
I feel that Tatsugiri would be great.after all it’s a famous type of sushi
Oinkologne would probably taste and smell delicious
That one player ordering rattata meat menu after i use F.E.A.R Tactic
As long as you don't hurt a slowpoke or a bidoof I'm fine
I would eat aurorus
birds like pige sparow farow.
If I lived in the Pokemon universe I would be a militant vegetarian
how about pigeons and doves. we do have them here in asia..as a meal i mean
I can tell the drum part is made in flipaclip
U didn't mention gardevoir and lopunny
Mikey in his white girl era
The Pokédex says that bay leafs meat is a delicacy
you know they are more then likely eating the pokemon right i mean do you ever see a normal animal in the show games or movies
Klawf al Ajillo 👨‍🍳😘
Would you eat a smallive
Klawf being edible is also supported by its legs being sandwich ingredients in Scarlet and Violet
Vanillite for sure
Grunty boy is a wizard.
magikarp
As an Aussie roo meat is good if prepared well it can be dry if not
Magikarp
I don’t know why it’s so funny when he just lists meat after meat saying it’s great🤣.
“I’m not gonna eat Bambi, I’ll eat his mom though”- Michael
The ice pokemon
Tangla spaghetti
Cloyster tastes like vagina. Can confirm.
Give me a pound of klawf meat and i'l make you a krab meal
Where are the Turtle Pokemon? Those Pokemon look delicious
I probably would eat Psyduck. it looks delicious
That vegan teacher would not be happy🤣
10:47 next video: Mikey not here rn because he was possessed, ONLY pumpkaboo LIVES
3:24 you are going be one of the victims in the upcoming Bambi horror movie then
No frog Pokémon? I mean, have you ever tried frog legs? They’re delicious! So, Politoed, you’re on the list of edible Pokémon
Oktillary would be good takoyaki!   Technically you can eat the legs of the frog/toad like Pokémon and the snail Pokémon would be escargot.
Bird meat. in turkey we consume BIRD MEAT
Cant believe you didnt mention the pokemon thats leteraly ice cream XD
You forgot mewtwo
What about vanillite
Duck and pheasant is not poultry. It is fowl. Also, pumpkin spice contains zero pumpkin meat. Pumpkin spice is cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and sometimes ginger... but no pumpkin.
I would eat florges
the comsumption of the animal
No Combee honey?  Also in the anime, Skiddo are stated to make some excellent dairy sources, since Skiddo milk makes for super delicious cheese and ice cream.
I saw this...and instantly wanted to say: I'd eat Gardevoir. Then realised that is stupid...then said it anyways
Why is it weird to eat Pokemon because of "the bonds and friendships they form"?? People bond with real animals all the time. I had a few cats I loved dearly. Didn't stop me from munching on beef, pork, chicken, etc because my bond isn't with every animal and the animal I'm eating was bred for food anyway
What about Tropius’s banana beard?!?
I mean lion meat is eaten by some people in the world so pyroar and arcanine could also be a great meal although probably very rare
Pumpkin spice miltank
Your going off like our perspective for food, ya gotta think outside the box more, wonder what an eevee tastes like for example
You forgot other fish like feebas and magikarp. Also a Mega kangaskhan kid would problaly be tasty too. Other bird pokemon, like moltres is basicaly a cooked bird. Also sorry pm7 but fidough would be good too, its basicaly a spanish pastry.
Team sky should watch : legendary and mythical battle royal
What about Smoliv? It’s literally an olive
Gelato
What about milk from Gogoat? It does learn Milk Drink.
Hear me out mewtwos tail
I would eat a tsarenna
I know some of the younger viewers wont get the bambi thing but man that was evil! 😂😂😂
“But not deerling, I’m not gonna eat Bambi, but I’ll eat his mom though.”  My favorite line from 2022 Mikey 😂😂😂😂
Most of these were on dookieshed's list from 7 years ago, but that was 7 years ago and needed an update.
I will 100% eat Sharpedo. Its Moon entry states that its fin is "tasty foodstuff". Also I just really shark meat, it's pretty good
U forgot Magikarp, Gyraados (Shrimps)
I feel like combee should have been on  this list. Sure, I wouldn't eat the bee part, but it looks like part of the pokemon is the honey, so removing that should work, right?
Why not - Pokemon: Gotta eat em all
Yummy for mikey LOL
I would eat pyduck as it seems like it would have some good meat on him. Also I would eat every pig but the Swinub line.also if dachsbun was to shed or something I wouldn’t mind trying some( edit : I was playing violet and the minute I posted this comment my dachsbun turned and ran while we where piknicking )
What about vanillish and vanillite
“I’m not gonna eat Bambi… but I will eat his mom though!” 🤨📸
Vegans are going to be ballistic
What about septile he literally grows fruit on his back
the only pokemon I would eat is crabby
There is one pokemon that you might have issues with.  The Swirlix Line in particular is NOT cotton candy. In fact, It is a dog XD  In the dex entries, It states that it's fur is as sweet as cotton candy. But other dex entries tell you that "It eats it's weight in sugar everyday".  When a dog eats too much sugar, it smells like sugar because the body is like "Help, we need to get rid of the sugar".That is why it tastes so sweet. Because it is just a perfume from the sweat it produces. You...are eating a dog who smells sweet but the fur is not food XD
Feesh
I'll eat dynamax alcremie IT'S LITTERALLY A CAKE
7:40 Peppermint is a bug repellent and caffeine is a chemical that plants produce to protect themselves from being eaten so you already consume bug repellent
I JUST got Petlil's dex entries! The liquid from boiling it's leaves can be both used as a pestacide and help you recover from fatigue because it's CAFFEINATED! Caffeine was adapted in order to kill pests, it's technically poison. We just have a habit of taking poisons and becoming addicted to them (Caffeine, alcohol, etc.)
Mandjtv has gotten nicer to grungy boi has anyone noticed that?
God I would love more videos like this, idk why but this is incredibly entertaining to me
02:00 you seem to deliberately go over the part where the berries mix with shuckles' body fluids... but I mean honey is quiet popular as well
“I’ll eat his mum though” -Micheal 2022
I know that he's a poison type, but hear me out, if prepared properly, I could see Drapion being something at least edible as we already eat Scorpions. And the Fruit from GMax Snorlax sounds Delectable. We also forgot Combbee, not necessarily for eating it, but it's honey. However if it did pass, isn't it made of a Cakey like sponge anyway?
I personally think that tatsugiri would be tasty, given that dondozo eats it
Who hates miltank  and wants them to be steak 🥩
what about tastugiri
“I’ll eat his mom though.” - Mikey 2022
bounsweet bath water, anyone?
Dont forget to use alakazams spoons
Tea is the most perfect drink
Mikey: But people do it so it must be safe. The tide pod challenge: Yeah. Safe.
Despite it being my 2nd favorite Pokémon ever, you forgot vanilluxe I'd actually eat it, pretty sure they're really good ice cream, I think they can just naturally make it for you too without killing lol
Gotta eat em all
What animal does shuckle looks like
3:22 Ayo🤔
I swear if this video has a Vaporeon joke Imma just straight up ragequit
Remembers Whitney gym leader battle: *MILTANK EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!*
You forgot Gator
Smoliv ??? (It's litteraly an oliv)
Theory: The Petilil leaves might have caffeine in them. Bc Caffeine is toxic to bugs so good bug repellent and it rids of fatigue. Or it could be an essential oil idk
11:16 I was playing Pokémon Sword while watching this video and just as he said this my opponent sent out a Basculin, so yes, overpopulation is a problem
He did forget vanilte or whatever ever it’s called but it’s ice cream
Trevanant and make some nice pine needle tea I recon
I think that muk would be so yummy to-
I am so happy that you didn’t just eat a whole slowpoke it’s my favorite Pokémon
ummm uhhh combsken is fire type sooooo you basically die
What about the ice cream pokemon
What about Fidough? I know it’s a cute doggo, but it’s also, just sentient dough. In the shape of a dog. I think it would be fair game in the Pokemon that are food category. Especially since evolution appears to just, add more dough? And bake it? At least I think Dachsbun is baked. Is it? Idk I feel like both would be fair game. Not that I condone eating a doggo, even if it is a sentient piece of pastry.
Scarlet and violet suggestion Smoliv and Lechonk. An OLIVE AND BACON though I don’t like olives do you?
You forgot Vanilluxe
Yes I would love to order 2 miltank burgers and a glass of moo moo milk and 4 miltank sosages on the sides
what about vanilluxe?
STOPP I have never wanted to eat my favorite pokemon sawsbuck as much as I have now
Ditto it can legit be everything
Pretty sure more than a few bug type pokemon would have some good meat. I mean, fried Scorpi(Heat destroys scorpion venom,) with some Chargabug tea, and roasted Galvantula for dinner. Have a Kricketune burger for lunch. And I don't know why, but I am convinced karrablast would make a good stew...
There are several things we eat that are toxic to bugs and bug repellents. Spicy food is deadly to them. Caffeine acts like alcohol for them. And several other foods and drinks.
I read the title of this video and then pondered about the ethics of consuming Pokemon for like ten minutes. And then I realised that I forgot to press play and watch the video.
Why do we have to buy bread when we could just use Fidough
GRUNTY RISES AGAIN!
I wanna eat zigzagoon
Whattt
What about legendaries? You mentioned deer and such, imagine eating Xerneas, LIFE itself being consumed by you, your body gotta feel great from that.
miltank's milk drink hurts miltank if used outside of battle
mikey i think appletuns skin (depending on his back or his green skin) the green skin would most likely be fruit and appletuns back would probably be apple pie considering how bready it looks so it would probably be in the carbohydrates category
A nice pumpkaboo with all conditions met and a sweet alcremie would make one of the best desserts! And some tauros and miltank burgers as the main course. And a sweet nutritious healing glass of miltank milk before bed. *IT'S THE BEST*
So, basically you're eating your friend's favourite pokémon's child.
So, basically you're eating your friend's favourite pokémon's child.
You don’t really need to sacrifice the poor alcremie line, as seen in the anime, they can just produce their whipped cream from their palms whenever they want
Vanillish? Mabye? ⟟ mean… it IS icecream!
Grunty needs to join team sky at this point
Someone show this to that vegan teacher
Now I have the urge to make menus out of Pokémon products
febas and milotik
There’s actually a Pokémon book where pikachu drinks “shuckle juice”
Taste like friendship!
I think the issue with the Team Rocket plot in gold and silver is the fact they were kidnapping Slowpoke and violently chopping off their tails rather then having them fall off naturally like in the dex.     Also good to see Mikey working on his hate boner for Miltank. Slowly work it out of your system man.
What about applin
"I wouldn't eat Bambi. I would eat his mom, though." My reaction to this is "JESUS IF IT SHE WASNT SHOT IN THE MEADOW🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Magikarp, anyone?
Klawf, Magikarp and Pidgeot.
Veluza. I don’t even care if it tastes good. I just want at least one more gone from this world.
This how people in legends arcoos survive
magikarp is good
Vanallite
Going off of this comment section, I'm convinced that 80-90% of you would get yourselves killed in the first month of your journey from eating something you shouldn't have. That much is obvious from the number of comments suggesting he "missed" the extremely cold icicle Pokémon who happen to resemble ice cream. If you want a cold snack, stick to the berries of a friendly Snover.
Oh yeah,I would definitely eat some Alcremie,if you know what I mean.
"I won't eat Bambi 😊But i'll eat his mom though 💀"
flapple would be a good pokemon to eat its basically the same but the apple isnt sweet Edit: Xerneas would be good too and YAVULTAL looks like a delicous bird/chicken whatever it is it just looks like it would have good meat
Damn Michael is a huge gourmet.
You want to eat some scorpion meat too? Be my guest, Drapion is my Miltank.
We act like eating pokemon is weird because everyone is friends with their pokemon, but I own pet chickens and I love eating chicken.  I think that's all it is. It's like having a pet pig and eating bacon. Everyone likes cute little pigs. Everyone loves bacon.
what about vanilite
psyduck and golduck are platapus
I would eat a lechonk I would always eat a really good Spanish bacon made with lot of spices .
Tauros and milktank and buffolant
I am applauded, you would eat farfetched? That’s my brother!
3:23  “What’re you eating?” “Your Mom”  I can’t get this scenario out of my head
No gardevoir or lopunny?
Baskuleigion is like 10 more basculion than one
He needs to visit New England
Don't forget Dollive and Arboliva. Maybe not eat parts of them specifically, but they're known to give away a nutritious oil and they're based on olives. So... basically, a vitamin-packed olive oil equivalent. Perhaps, to make a nice salad dressing, or just for general cooking.  Also, duck is a very commonly-eaten bird; I don't really like it very much, but that would mean that at the very least, Psyduck and Quaxwell might be viable. I assume Quaxly and Quaquaval are probably in the same situation as Torchic and Blaziken, respectively.  And, not to mention, in Scarlet and Violet, a dish in the game is said to have a spicy Scovillain sauce, which sounds like it could be interesting.
I feel u should not eat miltank bcauz its ur enimy, i would be discusted🤮
veluza
I like pumpkin stuff too you have good taste
Gmax alcremie is a giant cake
I'm gonna assume that the Appleton was delicious at the time, but it evolved to taste more bitter
Personally, I love lamb and similar meats so skiddo and gogoat are definitely on my menu
Thank you so much bro I was watching a video and I just got a shiny hopip
milsteak
Pokémon is humans, murder!
You're bad person
While pumpkin sweets are certainly delicious, my mom made pumpkin and pork soup once, and it was actually quite pleasant :)
I expected you to say tropius since people already eat its fruit
what eat pokemon
miltank milk cow
You forgot the obvious one...Pidgey.
gmax alcremie is just an endless supply of cake
I have a feeling that consuming a whole Milktank would be quite a challenge.
Where is Magickarp???????
I personally would like to give sinistea or polteageist at least a little taste
I would take a milcery sundae any day
People who agree with this list  | | ⬇️
This isn't food but I think it would be fun to use pincurchin as a pincushun because when I played pokemon shield, it got 5 KO's whereas all of Hop's other pokemon got 3 KO's put togethar all of which were zachian.
Me: YOU MONSTER  Also me: bro but I could go for like a vanilluxe sundae too 🥲
Soon the vegan teacher will be canceling you Mikey😂
I’d eat kingler in a heartbeat. Love some sea food boils😍😍🤣
I have also tried kangaroo meat before, kangaroo burger to be specific. The meat ain't bad exactly, but it does get dry super easily and isn't that tasty when it does
Raid has sponsored Grunty boi enough to turn him into a mage.
I feel like you eating miltank everyday is just motivated by your spite against it
"As they enjoy the suffering of it's victim - minor stuff" - Mickey
for those who do like lamb, mareep and flaffy would be good, also i feel like seeking and spearrow would be good
The fact that some of these are supported with actual Pokedex facts and not just random opinions is hilarious to me 😂
Tatsugiri new gen 9 pokemon It's literally sushi and sceptile's berries look tasty
You forgot sunkern since sunflower seeds are a snack a few people like
Don't forget to get Combee honey
Like... pokemon you'd eat... or... pokemon you'd... *EAT*?
“ I get to enjoy the flavor and it’s DEMISE”
you know the Pokédex entry where it says that malamar mind controlled a whole group of people once in time it’s probably from eating their meat. 🤣 or for being caught eating their meat by other malamar.
No turtles?
13:40 OH MY GOD HE MENTIONED IT! Yes! Sushi is so good, and I also like eel! I actually did not know that eel would be so good in sushi, but I discovered back in 2020 with my parents!
This man is a comedic genius I swear I was cracking up every 10 seconds
How about a Nuzlock but every certain amount of time you have to eat an edible Pokemon to feed yourself. The bigger/tastier the Pokemon the longer you can last until your next meal.
“I’ll eat his mom though.” Wow… well said. XD
Lopunny. Rabbit meat.
Appletun is,I think,appple pie
PETA may hate you, but we love you!
9:12
Yes grass is blue
Vegans watching this : 👁👄👁
7:32 some honey honeyed screams
3:26 can i get sky bison instead of ground bison please?
On one hand, it’s a good video, and it IS canon that some Pokémon are prey animals. But on the other, my inner child is now inconsolable. 3:24 Oh, you did NOT!
Mint is a bug repellent
In scarlet you make the sandwhich with the pokemon not for them
Does... Does Mikey know that pumpkin spice isn't made of pumpkin? Like, sure, you could still EAT the pumpkin as a pie, but pumpkin spice refers to the spices used to flavor pumpkin (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger).

Magikarp
You forgot the ice cream pokemon. I feel like Vanillish would be amazing.
U missed vanilat
"lechonk is to small" well played
HSI Grand tip boy
gory teams for events
Combusken is top for me. It’s probably spicy. Same goes for Pignite. I’d also totally eat both Croconaw and Feraligatr. Gator is delicious. And obviously the Fuecoco line. Spicy gator? Sign me up!
it is a horror for me but i would become a vegetarian if i get into the pokemon world pokemon are just to smart to eat
Imagine PETA sees this video...
I mean I'd prolly eat every one except steel,rock, or poison types maybe ground too but I'd eat a cubone or something like that
You my favourite  youtuber
Imagine being like  “Im gonna starve in the wild…”  *has a farfetch partner*  “Sorry bud”
Honestly though, I would take a massive bite out of a Bounsweet. Too much sugar? No such thing.
3:51 funny and dark asf 😂
Every time his sponsor is Raycon
I’m vegan. Why? Because my parents are vegan
Looks like eating pokemons as was on ealier games. And I didn't knew that.
im hungry
Michael made sure to show us his Texan heritage with this video 💁🏽
I don't think anyone has ever hated a specific pokemon more than Mikey.
no its cause lechonk  is       cute thats    why
i think you should eat vanilis or the evolution line or maby smoliv idk if you said that
I'm gonna eat Bambi.........I'll eat his mom tho. -Michael 2022
I would eat a VULCIN VELUUUUZA!!!!
Here in the Caribbean we use punking to cook our beans stu. Is delicious and is perfect with rice and any meat or poultry.
I would eat Gardevoir 😳
miltank’s body is a5 wagyu steak and the milk provides you with ABSOLUTE RIPPED BODY AND A 6 PACK
Octerelly or something idk how to spell it
There's a WAY simpler way to go about this. Simply get really friendly with an Alakazam, until it gives you one of its spoons. According to the Pokedex, anything eaten out of an Alakazam's spoon become delicious. Then it doesn't MATTER what you are actually eating.   Addionally, since people do consume milk from other animals than cows, I assume the milk of many other Pokemon is edible. Contenders would include Sheep pokemon (like the Mareep and Woolu lines) Goat pokemon (like Gogoat) Buffalo Pokemon (like Boufflaunt) Camel pokemon (like Numel and Camerupt) Horse Pokemon (Ponyta Rapidash etc.) and donkey Pokemon (Mudbray).
Imagine a teacher having a dead aplin on their desk
Starbucks customers be like: "this bounsweet isn't sweet enough"
I’d eat a charmander            Tail
Alcremie = *cream waifu*
if my mom had cancer and we lived in the pokemon world i would go to a pokemon center and ask for chansey’s egg so i could make my mom a delicious and curing chansey scrambled egg
I want to put some of the some of the sweat inside of the bitter tea
Jessie and James without gloves are my nightmare.
What pokemon i think would taste good (Gen 9): Toedscool and Toedscruel, in toedscools dex entry, it says that its flaps are chewy and delicious! much like crabominable, i think that toedscruel would be the same, but more!. Veluza, its dex entry says that the unnecessary flesh that it discards to make its psychic power increase is mild but delicious!. Capsakid, its dex entry says that the shedded front teeth are used in various traditional paldean dishes, but because their used, it makes the dishes very spicy, i think that scovillain would be the same but even more spicy, but i would be cautious with scovillain teeth becaus apparentally the spicy chemicals have made the green head go vicious. Arboliva and Dolliv, in their dex entries say that the oil they have are nutritious and delicious, but not smoliv, its oil is bitter and astringent. Tatsugiri? im more hesitant on this one because it doesnt say if its edible, but if this is a bird pokemons main prey, Hey i'll try it! also if i do eat it it better be washed a LOT of times, since it hides in dondozos mouth a lot (also its a DRAGON type???). Klawf, exact same reason as mikeys!. Garganacl, this may be weird BUT, it says in tis dex entry that pokemon gather around garganacl hoping to lick its MINERAL RICH salt! could use some salt for a dish! also maybe brute bonnet considering its not poison type
5:20 Give grunty boi raycon headphones and he'll evolve into Magic boi, a normal psychic type, the amazing power of raycon ear buds has caused him to evolve, giving him powers beyond human understanding.
I'd eat a tentacool
Shi I’d eat a pikachu
Me who's algeric to pumpkin
Probably something like Rayquaza. Not so much for the taste or nutrients but for the status.
Bro I like unfezant specifically the male version
There is actually a theory that pokemon like Alcremie do, or at least used to, prey on humans. There are ambush predators that camouflage themself as the food of their prey.
In S/V they prove that you can eat Klawf
12:15 in the new S&V games it talks about how people use lechonks to sniff out crabominables meat because it’s just that good so yes, it would taste very good!
Bariscuda is so big that it can poison you with it's meat (It is a barracuda thing)
Squirtle and it’s evolutions would probably make a great turtle soup
I used to skip Grunty Boi's ads. Then I just skipped the beginning. Now I watch them all the way through.
i just realised there’s probably a Poké-vegan teacher
Magikarp
Lechonk more like lebacon or lepork or lesausage
I think you should look into lechonks evolution's they are literally pigs
so you wiLL not  eat bami but he mama (edit) POV bami in pokemon
As a chef, i approve.. and would add a dragon. I wanna taste a dragon
Imagine if the vegan teacher saw this😂
Maybe a fish kind like the water type Pokemon
12:53 as someone who’s lived in Boston for the past year plus you are absolutely doing the Boston accent correctly, R’s become H’s lol
Magikarp, Feebas, Gyarados, Sharpedo, Finneon, Lumineon, Bruxish I guess, And heck, Wiglett. It's basically unchopped sushi rolls, dude. 🤣
Smoliv, Fidough and Oinkologne look appetizing
I prefer appletun hat you know appletuns have hats soo i would eat them sinse there apples.
you could get high on Sprigatito
Just don't eat me. Please? (You won't right?)
What about magikarp I think it would be tasty
mabicarp
"aha it is i ✨GRUNTY BOI✨ "
Me:*laughs in intellect*
If u like spicy u could like slowpokes glarrian formm tail
I think magicarp and Garidos would taste amazing
Rip miltank😢
What are you talking about grunty boy? Grass is not blue it’s red!
I just got back into this franchise and clicked on your channel to find, this.
Im more concerned about how the people who made the Pokedex found out they were tasty. Like, is that just a regular test for Pokedex entries?
Milotic, luvdisc will also be good
"I would enjoy it's flavor.... AND ITS DEMISE."                 - Mikey 2022
Quick little mention you should try wild boar meat it's fricken amazing
That thumbnail lol
Bro eats wailord for dinner every day
please make this the most liked comment on this channel
I love all these foods so I’d eat everything in this video
Bulbasaurs bulb juice. If heracross loved it me and u will
This is accurate, given by how many Pokémon descriptions mention the consuming of a body part or the whole thing in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
Miltank not milbank
I love your videos too
This might sound random but please bring back pokemon talk
I was watching this as I played a reseted pokemon shield file, and went to catch a bownsweet as soon as it popped up....
There are is scream cone Pokemon
With a Boston accent it’s”pwak the cwa
vanilite
For got bulbasaur, squirtle,and charmander
Vanillish
I had a good laugh at the Miltank Comment everybody enjoys miltanks demise
I would eat magikarp because I like fish hopefully it taste like salmon
NaCl = Sodium Chloride  Sodium Choloride = Table salt  NaCl ~ NaCli (pokemon)  NaCli = edible  Also NaCli = Salt
hoot hoot is the best bird pokemon to eat
Dog Is A Food So I Think Grevard Would Be Good NOT Houndstone
Got some bad news for you about pumpkin spice; it doesn't actually contain any pumpkin. It a mix of a few things, but the most prominent flavor is the cinnamon.
sandshrew meat sounds good
pidgeotto and pidgey
Grunti boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
You missed magicarp
I’ve heard snake meat is good so you could eat ekans, arboc, and the other snake Pokémon
I imagine the animal plants are just beyond meat lol
I wonder what Grunty Boi's perferred pokemon dishes would be like.
жиза так же бы поел кроме рыбы
the captions said gory team for events
i would love g max  alcremy  because it is unlimited cake!!!
klawf is a rock
wiglet spiggeti
Murder...                                                              Miltank
This is hilarious! Makes my day, thank you for this funny video.
**Currently waiting for any angry vegans and PETA fans*
this video reminds me of that cursed chikorita cooking video
I think I would eat bulbasaurs bulb
The gen 1 and 2 starters seem like they might be quite delicious
What would be the point of being a vegan in the Pokémon world if even the plants are alive? (I mean as lively as an animal or person)
Gigantamax alcremie because it's al literally a cake
I'm subscribed to all your channels
Looking at this when Mikey was saying that Lechonk is too "smoll" 4 weeks ago and now we have Chonk evolution which is even more perfect to be eaten as whole roast than Grumpig :D
I'd bet my bottom dollar luvdisc being a panfish equivalent would be just like crappie meat. I would eat so many luvdisc fillets
Fried Cajun Combusken legs Would SLAP
its mostly pumpkin spice not pumpkin then ....
4:04 You could could just torture it. ;)
You have to boil fire type meat to cook it
Eating the Applton skin would be like eating pie, not meat or apple.
Combee honey
I’m a person who definitely loves the taste of lamb and goat so Wooloo, Marleep, Flaafy, Skiddo, etc. would make some absolutely delicious and tender lamb chops in my book.
Since you clickaited about eating milk tank which is obviously inspired from cow so please talk about eating cow because it is very auspicious animal in Hinduism and in india
I forget I live in the ass crack of the south so I shouldn't be as surprised as I am when people say they don't eat deer or haven't in a long time. It's at least once a month in our house and it lasts a week.
Oddish
Not quite sure but I'm pretty sure crabomitable is a tarantula
I feel like Mikey is slowly turning into grunty boi who we just saw time travel here to make sure Mikey will continue down this path of eating Pokémon.
I would eat Krookodile cause crocodile meat is edible and i heard its a lot like chicken, so i think that might be something to have on a resturant.
if you drink miltanks milk you will turn into miltank but your head would be the same
You forgot to mention wailord. Yum
is a fish
maybe magikarp
Here is Miltank meat  just killed one🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖
WOWOWOWOWOWOW
WPW
Lol
Provide milk then chopped to death
Rip piloswine
I'd eat snorlax because it's probably pretty freaking nutritional and fatty
I think you missed a doduo because ostriches are really tasty.
Depending on where you live, it is aceptable to eat a sprigatito salad
In the end hes just gonna deep fry them
Tinimo seems like it would taste like a sardine or something
Michael:Most of their dex entries… Screen/Video:*1-2 dex entry(s)*
People who say Gen 5 is the worst have never listened to Black and White's music
2:20 you can also read the Pokémon book pikachu in love
a milktanks milk can make the tainer look like aa milkatnk i think
Don’t forget about gogoat ice cream
If The   Vegan Teachers was her she would flip out
I cant believe it; i wanna eat pokemon now
Palworld prep: the video
Nah Bro Grass Is Red
You missed gmax alcreami 😅
He missed goat
Best grunty boi segment of 2022
I really appreciate how you and castform love eachother :)
They actually did a whole episode about Shuckle’s juice in the anime
A L C R E M I E
10:45 Its ability isn’t Cursed Body, is it?
What about the ice-cream pokemon
JAIDEN WATHING THIS  NOOO CUMBUSKIN😵😵
“I’ll eat his mom though!” -Mikey 2022
As I always say gotta eat them all
You forgot vanillite
Icecream pokemon
Honey from
How about some Magikarp sushi, Shelmet escargot, Fidough bread, or Politoed legs?
Okay, Michael. Clearly you've never had good lamb before. I'd eat a rack of Wooloo chops or a leg of Mareep in a heartbeat!
Eat hoothoot
"I'm not going to eat Bambi, I'll eat his mom though"😂
U forgot combee and vespiquen honey
11:36 Ayo
i didn’t know pumpkin pancakes existed until now
Me when he said he would eat sawsbuck 😲 😮 😲 😮 😲 😔
I weep for fidough, I do not wish to harm the pupper. However, I cannot help but wonder how good of a loaf it would make 😭
oddish? duh onion
I would eat Mr. Mime
Ranch dressing. My man!!
i feel like snorlax could be good to eat. like its thicc. packed with meat and no dex entry says its meat is disgusting. so it would be a fine try!
I think squirtle, warturtle, and blastoise would make good seafood because I know someone who ate turtle once and they said that it was really good
You can eat seeds, and I feel like exeggcute might be more like a nut and the egg is the nutshell, therefore edible.
Ok hear me out.Charizard thighs.
I bet Pidgeot would taste quite fine as a dish. No explanation, just lots of tender meat.
Haven't been watching this channel in quite a while, I think at least not since the beginning of the year. I realised that what I missed most was Grunty Boy. XD
I would drink miltanks milk 🥛 ( if my dad left for it then it must taste amazing )
Yum! Especially, the Miltank I like me some miltank murde. . . I mean miltank milk and pork!😃😃😃😉
gory teams   -subtitles
My theory on Appleton’s whole children eating it’s back skin, the bumps on the Appleton’s back might be able to just fall and or be pulled off painlessly and it might regrow.
I know I'm late but what about vanillice or whatever it's called is it not just ice cream with ice
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
13:18 🤣
i dare you to eat gigantamax alcreamie
Bulbasour (is that how you spell it?) Might make a great salad!
Me when you said petilil: 😢  Me when I found out you were just talking about it's headleafs: (Can't find emogi that shows relief)
9:40 I strongly agree. Pumpkin pie is my favourite dessert
He Thinks That Raw Oysters Is Weird But Not Raw Fish... But I Agree XD (Sushi Is My Favorite Food 👌)
Here me out, I know that Gyarados it's a big fish, but its body is kinda similar to a shrimp without the exoskeleton, so I think it would be really tasty, a really big and tasty fresh shrimp
cheryums small ball hmmmmmmmm
i saw lechonks evo in a leak and lechonks evolution is gonna be a nice meal for me
Have you ever tried sloth
Hey! You forgot an annoying one in the og Pokemon game! Pidgey!!
Pumpkin Spiced Marshmellow.
3:20 I died laughing.. I am super immature.
Magikarp...
The best pokemon dessert would be vanittite
What about fidough,or vannillite line
i like to think that combusken is very spicy
Is anyone going to mention the ps4 controller and how it was off in the sponsor segment 4:23
That grass joke with the ad🤣🤣🤣
Mikey: *eats Grumpig and starts levitating*
Slowpoke tails are real in…I think Japan?
As a cultured man i have watched Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon maid, and since Dragon tail is edible weather it’s bad or not, I’d be willing to try dragonites tail or even garchomp tail
Did you know that all of the American states are part of the Unova region
I don't know why but I want to eat an Octillery
Bunny/hare pokemon and whale pokemon not being here is sad.
Mikey: “ill eat its mom though”. Care to explain??
Maybe Froakie or frogideer because frog legs
How dare you do I am Feza dirty you are such a liar and male on pheasant is perfect
Personally i would love to try some Vainlaxe
Kangaroo is 10/10 delicious
If I lived in the Pokemon world I could go for a Miltank steak and/or burger, Combusken tenders, Petilil tea, and Snover berries.
um, vannilite?
I completely forgot grumpig existed
Miktank is a dairy cow you can't eat dairy cows
Pumpkin bread?
Shuckleberry wine
3:21 Out of context, this is GOLD
Ok… Random thought but what if the fire type Pokémon that are on fire is a curse that the devil/Giratina put on them all for eternal suffering but really though is it.
I would have eat vullaby cause its a turkey's or its evolved
Mikey just didn't mention doduo and dodrio gotta make a nice KFC right
I would eat Arceus because I can
also squids have brain cells all through-out there bodies, so malamar could pretty much posses you if you eat it :)
I replay your videos over and over in the morning because your voice cheers me up. :]
Vanillice?
What about a pumpkin flavored pumpkin
MILTANK IS MY FAVORITE I AM PISSED!
combee!
You should make a video on how you’d prepare each legendary Pokémon as a food dish.
One of the greatest challenge that mikey could do on the Plays channel is to play any game like sword and shield or heartgold WITH ONLY MILTANK.If he does it one day, i m begging this will be his most viewed video 😂(plus his reactions would be insane).
I would be down to try magikarp
I wood eat snorlax meat for 2 months
Wait I don't know if someone already said this in a comment but I am just thinking of that one that's entry where itself if you have a diet of milk tank milk you literally just look like the milk tank itself that how milk tanks are actually made except the other ways three breeding
I am Indian
hear me out.. Chickorita not only do i hate it BUT its a walking pear, cut off the legs and leaf, And YOU JUST MADE GORMET PEAR
I wanna eat a voltorb
Try Squirtle soup
Do you like pumpkin coffee
Havent tried rabbit meat yet but am definitely down to make my least favorite pokemon ever suffer, as long as I don't get burnt in flames in the process
MI would eat Mamoswine M
Go to therapy😅
I’d eat every non fossil Pokémon
why is Appletun not in the "food with faces" category? IT'S A DAMN APPLE PIE
Pumpkin Pickle 🎃🥒
I would eat smolive magickarp not The ice-cream one it just a ice... ALLfrog pokémon sorry pmg7 I'm French  that seed pokémon maybe suncrun gogoat maybe if  goat meat exit and that's all.
Why i think u don't need to buy wedding cake in your wedding,you just need to gigantamax alcreami and you get a whole neighbourhood size wedding cake.
I think garchomp would be delicious.
i wonder would pokemon be halal and kosher
YO on a legit note you can’t tell me you couldn’t see papyrus and grunty boy being friends, they look like they would find eachother funny and papyrus could finally find a friend so wholesome😊
Bison burgers, chicken with buffalo sauce and ranch...I just ate dinner, and you're making me hungry again!  😆
You have forgotten Magickarp. I wouldn't eat it but I know some people that would.
I feel like some pokemon are more likely to be food than other in thr same vein as Monster hunter, yes there are a lot of monsters that you can hunt for meat, so why not eat a brachydios or a deviljho? Because we can't digest it or it's not nutritious I mean you think we can eat a salamander that protudes fire from it's tail? Or in the same vein, we can train lechonks, gogoats, miltanks etc... because some people keep them as pets

"I'm not gonna eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom, though." John Michael Groth, 2022
Alcremie's cream, being a Fairy-type, might actually counteract the Ghost-type related side effects of Pumpkaboo's consumption
1:18 That Lapras kid has a new mission
3:23 greatest line ever heard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Would you eat Qwilfish? Real life people have been able to eat pufferfish it's like the most strictest thing can can ever learn to be I think there like 5 people in the world that can properly make it if made wrong you are dead
Why not g max alcremie it’s a freaking cake
i would eat xerneas
Magickarp
I like to think that Slowpoke tails grow painfully quick and so in order to like... Not have a super long tail that causes issues. Then the tails would be cut off (like trimming nails) and then cooked and ate lol.
Gyarodos would probably be good because Magicarp is good
“Cherubi’s Small Ball” 💀
Ah yes I too eat the meat of my least favourite animal knowing that it had to die for my to eat this
OMG what is going on with Grunty Boi's character arc
"I'll eat his mom though" Funniest quote
Shuckle is just a walking beer keg
Maybe Sinistea and Polteageist
Magicparp
Honey from combee
Sinistea and Polteageist are literal drinks
Like mushrooms I highly recommend the lion's mane mushroom it is so good it tastes like chicken but the texture is rubbery it's delicious
As a country gal myself, I have eaten venison my entire life, I'd also might try Virision if it wasn't a legendary though
i was waiting for cherubi but it didnt show up
"i will eat his mom though"
Bambi is a girl😂
i would probably still try to bake eggsecute into a crepe thinking its a bunch of eggs
After watching this I now want to eat the Pokémon mentioned in the video
I wanna send this to that vegan teacher
1:30 not specific enough. Which egg are we talking about here.
Bear meat (ursarang)
You absolutely missed vannilite and it's evolutions. Literally ice cream
Vanilluxe gellatto 😍😍👌🏻
get it right bro chicken goes the best with blue cheese
I am wondering how grunty boi was made
Im glad that im not on this list!
I highly recommend a South african dishes called bull tong and bull heart , it is delicious
Your hatred of Miltank is hilarious!
Yeah cause I think Slowpoke are like geckos, so sometimes their tails just fall off when they’re stressed and they can regrow them
Both me and my mom eat pumpkin with food like meat, rice and beans, stuff like that, normally! One quick note: we're Brazilian, so we eat rice and beans + meat and veggies.
i like lamb and would eat wooloo and dubwool and sheep milk too (its good)  miltank and gogoat for milk products
I mean I haven’t read the den entry but lechonk might be good because he’s a pig and I like bacon sooooooo :/
Hallelujah raycon made headphones!
3:21  “I’m not gunna eat Bambi……..I will eat his mom tho”  -Pokefan Mikey 2022
Mikey! The fact that petilil is edible to humans but has bug repellent properties is actually pretty accurate! Humans in general are able to consume all sorts of chemicals and plants that are dangerous to other life forms. Like mint! Spiders and other insects hate it, but we use it for all sorts of coooking! Same for caffeine and coco!
Fun fact: Mint is a delicious herb often used for cooking and tea, and in some cases can be used as a bug repellant! Growing it in and around your garden can also repel deer and other garden-ravaging pests.  Ta-ta!!
grunty boy has no ttouched grass
id eat the entire bulbasaur line                                e
Imagine realizing the meat showed in the show is artificial
“I’m not going to eat Bambi… I’ll eat his mom though!” If I didn’t just hear that come out of Mikey’s mouth I would’ve thought that was something Jack said in one of his videos 😂
I personally never tried rabbit meat but media in general describes IT as really tasty, so bring me some bunelby stew whit some good potatoes(not going to dissapoint Sam here) plus, im helping end the life of some annoying and ugly creatures, so I kill 2 rabbits wjit one fork
9:06 i don't want bounsweet sweat i want tsareena sweat
Pokémon you missed Magicarp,Dracofish,Carvanha and Sharpedo
i would definetly eat the vanillite line, edible or not cause i’m willing to take those risks😋
I have to wonder if you  could eat eggy bois like you would pistachios or sunflower seeds ooh or pumpkin seeds
missed one smoliv is a BIG olive😁
This video makes me hungry
I THOUGHT RAYCON ONLY HAS EARPHONES BUT THERE IS ALSO HEADPHONES?????? EPIC IM BUYING THEM
This video makes sense because you need food to live
wahts about Magikarp?
wtf is closed captioning doing
Petilil tea and a Chansey/Blissey omelet sounds like the perfect start to every morning.
A nuzlocke with the Pokémon you hate, but when they die, you eat them as a meal in real life
Grunty boy is a pro gamer. Grass is over rated
hoot hoot
"ill eat hes mom tho" AY AY AY AY AY AY AY CHILL BROOO
"Salty stew"  My brain:needs more salt
"I'll eat his mom though." ... We are still talking about food, right?
yeah no i would eat a krabby
Punkin donuts
you compleetly missed the best looking one kyogre fish for days but like fride lugia dosnt sound bad
Leave a like if you want pokemon talk back
You forgot the Vanillite line. They're literally ice cream.
Daruk from LoZ would love the rock Pokémon
“ yeah people do it. It must be safe” michal 2022
octilery
You missed Fidough
Me looking for a drowzee comment from John 😂
Thing is, people in reality befriend animals and form close bonds. But we still eat them. Eg. Maybe a farmer adores their cows, but they can still eat cow meat
PUMPKIN MILTANK MILK
Pumpkin ghost
I LOVE PUMPKIN TREATS TOO MAN
I clicked off of the video whenever you said you would eat appletun. SMH
3:25 live in Colorado
Hu, so basically shukle is a mini distillery. Bet he won,t be too out of place in the moon shine mob.
“Although I can’t remember what grass is like.It’s blue right?                                                                                                       -Grunty Boy
Mikey: How's malamar gonna kill me.. *if its dead?* me making a ghost type malamar for my fakemon region: *evil laugh intensifies*
4:15 when grunty boi said his new headphones my headphones just turned off as if saying “NO! NO OTHER BRANDS IN MY OWNER!”
Surprised you didn't even mention the literal ice cream pokemon lol
I personally would try to eat a Magikarp, they look good enough to at least get my curiosity, I'm also curious about how Gyarados meat taste (or if it is even edible to begin with)
I haven’t watched you since like 1 and an half year ago lol
No Polteaguist (sp?)
Did he say ishi washi i dont know how to spell ishi washi im dumb di he say it?
A thunder taste to fried Zapdoz a hot moltres chicken and a nice frozen articuno chicken sandwich
This is the weirdest Pokémon video I’m existence Now I’m hungry
Honestly, if I was a traveller in the Pokemon world my top 3 Pokemon would be Tropius for the fruit and transportation, Miltank for the milk and Delibird for a portable storage
0:19 Mikey: *dramaticly stares at drowsey*
where is vanillite/vanillish?
You missed vanilluxe and vanillite.
“I’ll eat his mom tho”          -mandjtv 2022
A note: Pumpkin Spice does not contain pumpkin. It's the spices you would put into a pumpkin pie: cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger
Mandjtv: i’m not gonna eat Bambi but I’ll eat his mom tho Me: hol up wait a minute
Piplop
Litwick is so good I will eat the wak
"I wouldn't eat Bambi, but I'd eat his mom though."  -MandJTV
"yes I know those Pokémon are terrible. but what if we ate them instead ?"

The SCP Add, Gruntyboy is a Type Blue.
What about the sentient ice creams?
Magikarp
11:44 crabomination?
Eat The Other Reptiles Talls
When you realize that shelder is poisonous, and by extension, so would cloyster
Is he back?
hey what about aegislash it looks SCRUMPTIOUS
Pumpkin spice poison dart frog
“I’m not gonna eat Bambi…but I’ll eat his mom though.”-mandjtv 2022
you should do a sequel where you eat the food/animal the pokemon is based on.
This has huge RyanGeorge "all the sounds I know how to make" vibes
U forgot sinstea
“I’d never eat Bambi… I’d eat his mom though!”  Best quote ever
Polteageist shares its tea with those it likes..
I remember when I was younger. I used to think that Tropius was an evolution of Chikorita. I have known for years now for that not to be the case. I just think it's funny to think about
Oh my God. I could own a Shuckle, have a friend, and have some thing like wine on a regular basis.  Perfection
we do smash or eat next
Pumpkin spice everything!? YUK!!! Has Mickey gone insane!?
I finally found someone who says Mil-curry and not Mil-surry
"And since I like to eat" "I want to try Shuckles juices" "I'll eat his mom, though" "I would drink his milk, too" "I can't seem to remember what grass is like" "Playfully morally grey" "I think that's enough meat for now" "I like mushrooms" "Cherry like balls on it's head"  "Only it's sweat" "Caught in things throats... I don't wanna choke" "Are just cream"  -Michael, 2022
GRUNTY GAMER!
You forgot about magi boi
I would try Relicanth purely because of how old it is, I feel like it would have a really unique taste. I'd also try any of the turtle/tortoise Pokemon because of the rumour that Galapagos tortoises were incredibly delicious
6:50 welp, suicide. A completely white shroom is ultra poisonus and has effects on your mind similar to that of hard drugs
14:10 you were the chosen one you are supposed to destroy the people who think eggsecute are seeds not join them!
can you cook fire based pokemon? like magcargo
now im wondering how miltank cheese tastes
And now i'm hungry
I just pre-ordered Pokémon scarlet and I'm so excited for when it comes out!!!!!
when ar eyou goin to introduce us to trinity  ;)
All I can say in regards to the Miltank segment is “make sure you have a higher Speed stat than her Michael” 😅😅😅  Thanks for the laughs Michael and go hug your animal friends all 💙🐱💙
You should visit Bangladesh We have this curry that we make with beef and pumpkin and it's super delicious
gyarados
7:58  Cherubi's small balls :)
Yum yum
I thinck Mikey should check out Pokémon platinum and I’ve played and beat it 3 times and I recomendable picking the fire type starter it’s good and Mikey if you want to do the post game and I reclámense playing
Nice a scarlet and violet Food guide. also Would you like pumpkin cake?
Counterargument for clawdaunt, have you ever had a crawfish boil?
when Mikey said "pumpkin spiced EVERYTHING" he just confirmed he's a good old Southern Boy
Or warturtle
Mikey blastoise
The day after my birthday I will be clawf
WAIT WHAT I THOUGHT MILTANK WAS A PIG
What about frog legs
Imagine the vegan teacher comes to this video
M and J TV please play Bendy and the ink machine I hope you have an amazing day love dragon please❤❤❤
I really like how there were so many pokemon, goes to show he ain't fussy... however, the thing about ANY duck pokemon... nuh uh, you can't eat dem cus ducks are too cute for dat so pls no especially not quaxly ma boy, also my favourite animal is a duck das why. whass ur fav shiny btw? mine is wooloo, maybe.
Squirtle and wartortle and carracosta could make good turtle soup. Sharpedo and mantine fins. Skwovet stew. Golden and Seaking would be good fish. The whole walrein line, good fatty meat. I'm sure snorlax would be wagyu like. Omynite would be like conch meat. Hisuian sliggoo and goodra escargot. Skorbunny, bunnelby, diggersby would make interesting rabbit stews
Finding a gourgeist, catching it, bringing it to wherever the exorcism is being performed and then cooking the remaining pumpkin seems like a lot more work then just getting a non-possessed pumpkin.
I would eat Skiddo and Gogoat. It's mutton. In Indonesia, we cook mutton in various ways, like mutton satay, tengkleng, and nasi goreng kambing. I'd eat Gogoat fried rice anytime.
Breloom is many things but a kangaroo is hilarious😂😂😂😂
Yo where memes
Give me Pokemon types to put together
What about the ice cream guy?
I(as an ok chef)would want an alcreme because it is show in the anime to squirt it’s cream into the batter making it sweeter
Hey Mikey, do you ever intend to do a Emerald Kaizo or Platinum Kaizo playthrough without nuzlocke rules? Would be super fun to see your take.
Surprise the ice cream pokemon is not on the list sorry I don't remember the pokemon name also come on they are literally ice cream
6:52 I feel like they'd be.. uh... A different type of shrooms
The hate for Miltank is strong in this one. Lol. *Suddenly gets serious.* Nobody understands the pain and nightmares of Miltank.
"I'm not going to eat Bambi but ill eat his mom though" 🤣
such bland taste I'm gonna eat arceus
I would eat gengar because I hate gengar it is so annoying I would eat its dnyamax  form
VINTENDO SAID CASTFORM IS IRELIVANT
who doesn't like pumpkin stuff I'd eat pumpkaboo and its evolution, the best has to be pumpkin pie
Would you like roasted pumpkin seeds?
Michael: "I won't eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom though." Me: 👁👄👁
Let me bring you back to your 100 pokemon cards video. Tender tentacles
Lilligant and lopunny. Guess which kind of eat I mean.
What about galarian farfetch’d
Chansy actually give their eggs to those they have strong friendships with…. At least In the anime they do, like when they give their eggs to khangaskhan in journeys
We have the same birthday and type(November 13th) and (Dark and Pcychic
They ate Appletun skin in a Pokemon Journeys episode.
People married Pokémon whhyyyyyyyyyyyyy telll meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
I would only eat miltank
Please react to "Pokemon X, but all oponents are lv100" from smallant
Surprised he didn't say anything about the Vanillite line
How do you get a far girl in bed?  Piece of cake
Suprised there is no Vanillish here.
While Pignite might have too much muscle on them compared to marbled meat, this would not be the case for Mammoswine, while the legs would have significant musculature, the chest and belly would have very fatty and marbled meat, as humans used to hunt mammoths for not only fur but food as well, so it’s very likely that it has a significant amount of meat on it’s bones that would make for some delicious meals. As for Emboar, seeing as boar is literally in the name, there’s a very good chance that the meat around the abdominal region would be very tender, juicy, and sweet given that boars, while pests, are also good eatings because of the amount of fatty and well marbled meat that can be carved off of them.
Moltres because we know there are multiple and it looks like KFC so just put out the fire and cook it for a few days and you got chicken wings that can feed an entire town for days
Nice vid
I have a idea for a play through get 6 pokemon in sword or shield trade them in the beginning and see if you can beat the game with only that new team and if you want you can roll the dice half way through and trade one of the pokemon to see if you can get a legendary or what you consider is better then the pokemon you just traded away.
Apparently Croco meat seems very tasty and some people describe it as steak but with hints towards seafood or straight up fishy. what about turtle meat though? or.. Rat meat.. eww maybe if all other food sources ran out. of. sources.
This is already out of context as it is and it shouldn't
"I would  eat his mom" 💀
What about frog legs if you cooked a croagunk or Toxi croak long enough it wound be fine!
Am I the only one who thinks Mikey looks like Tom Ellis?
Greninja, frog legs are the bomb
I feel like maybe Combi’s honey would be good
Plenty of Bug repellent plants are edible. I know mint (and the related cat nip) repel pests and I believe cinnamon does as well
Vanillax ? Its a literal icecream
would u eat sir fetched ( I wouldn't ) and ludicolo or magmar
Did he say fidough?
YOU MISSED THE HONEY !
mikey will eat milltank till its exstinct
We need a video of Mikey only using Pokémon he would Eat on a team
“ I'll eat his mom though ”  Very Relatable
I think vegans would be able to eat any Pokémon, even the more animal/meat-based ones because Pokémon can consent to being eaten. So as long as Miltank says it's OK, you can have that steak even if you don't delight in its demise.
Scientist: so what do we do with this cloysters innards   Mikey: Give it to me  Scientist: it’s poisonous   Mikey: MEAT IS MEAT
*me putting 999999999999999 milktank beef on my sandwich*  Milktank:* almost extinct* Mikey:..... ???? What now?
I am pure vegetarian But I love this video  jokes were good though
mandjtv i want you to react to moxiedraws ai generated pokemon video it very interisting to ai bots create new pokemon i want you to react to it😊
You could eat Cacnea...He also missed every edible bug Pokemon
In the anime also in gen 4 I am saying, Ash and his friends eat the berries of Snover in season 12
I am. 99% sure, eating the skin off of appletuns back would be delicious, I would feel bad for eating a very nice looking Pokémon, but I would say it would probably diverge into the, pastry or sweets, category, since, it’s skin is similar to an apple pie skin I believe.
I think u missed vannilite and vanilluxe
“ I’ll eat his mom though” Michael
People are like "Oh my gooood, People don't eat pokemon in the pokemon universe they're friends" Not knowing that there are still part of the world that eat animals considered as pets and yeah, even extinct animals
Also, the less Slurpuff on Earth, the better. I need to consume all of it, and it’s soul*.   *I am not creepy.
Come on man, blue cheese is better on wings.
0:02 "Gory teams for events Michael here" - Youtube Captions, 2022
I know of a great plushie to be featured on Pokémon talk! Johnny the Walrus!
Man give me some Whailord or Kyoger meat
I would eat magicarp lol and also swirlix ;)
Bring back the national dex? No, BRING BACK POKÉMON TALK
Video: it is I, grunty boy CC: it is I grand tip boy 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
I now know how to cook as a 10 charzard cook the miltank so it will burn and make a good meal 🍖🍗🥩🥓
Michael should make a video or something listing off all the exotic and non traditional foods he's ever eaten. Preferably with a ranking system of "will never eat again" to "will eat everday"  This comment may get lost and ignored, but if our lord Arceus allows it, it may get enough traction to draw Michael here and give this idea even a moment's consideration.
Good I'm a vegetarian.
Types and there weakness that I'd be giving(copied from notepad)-                  (weakness↓) FIRE-  Water, Ground, Rock, Air WATER-  Grass, Electric, Poison GRASS-  Fire, Bug, Ice, Air POISON-  Psychic, Ground ICE-  Fire, Rock, Fight, Steel ELECTRIC-  Ground, Rubber GROUND-  Water, Bug, Ice, Grass, Rubber STEEL-  Fire, Electric, Ground, Sound, Fight GHOST-  Dark, Ghost AIR-  Rock, Ice, Electric PSYCHIC-  Ghost, Bug, Dark, Sound FAIRY-  Steel, Poison, Dark, Sound BUG-  Poison, Rock, Fire, Air FIGHT-  Air, Psychic, Fairy, DARK-  Bug, Fight, Fairy ROCK-  Steel, Water, Fight, Ground, Grass DRAGON-  Ice, Steel, Fairy NORMAL-  Fight, Dragon SOUND-  Water, Grass, Rock, Rubber RUBBER-  Poison, Ice  [REASON: Changing the name of Flying type to Air type, Fighting to Fight type. Air should be super effective(SE) against Fire as strong Wind can blow fire. Steel can conduct electricity more than Water. Poison should be SE against Bug and water coz people use insecticides in the field and home to keep away bugs. Poison also means pollution, water can be polluted. But not giving Air pollution coz all creatures take breath from air not only birds.  Sound moves 15 times faster(5150 m/s) in steels than Air, so sound is SE against Steel. Sound is SE against Psychic & Fairy. Coz psychic's cant concentrate due to noise and Fairies have a weak nerves. Sound weak against water coz water muffles sound. Also nobody can create sound underwater coz if u open mouth to create sound, water will get into your mouth.  Grass is SE against sound coz cotton can isolate sound, trees can block some sound and trees are quiet. Rock SE against Sound becoz hills and walls can reflect sound. Also Poison will be immune to sound coz generally poisonous snakes hearing range is too low(10 - 600HZ only).  Dragon should be weak against steel instead of dragon coz at the end, the knight slays the dragon. Also there is no strong logic for dragon weak to dragon rather dragon vs dragon rivalry ends so early in battle which doesn't give fun. Giving dragon SE against Normal just to give dragon strength.   Dark and Fairy both should be SE against each other coz angels and Evils both works against each other and wants to harm. Also "good will always prevail" this already applies for fighting so no need fairy again and this is not correct everytime. Fairies also represents Light and Light and Darkness opposite of each other and Super effects each.  Rubber is Electricty insulator, Soundproof and we use rubberlike things to vlean dirts. So its SE against Electric, Sound, Ground. Rubber also resists Steel, Fight, Rock, Water, Sound, Electric. Some acids distinguish Rubber and Ice makes rubber brittle. So its weak to Poison & Ice. Bug should be SE against ground coz bugs dig holes in ground to make colonies.]
You forgot the ice cream Pokémon
Don't forget that alcereami's gigantamax entry states that it has SO many calories even eating it could cause you to DIE. Can't imagine normal Alcereami XD
Maybe Stunfisk?🐟
As a native of paldeia I'd say klaf cooked rare with a side of tinamo sushi is a delicious recipe. Edit:pettilil leaves would go great as a spice for tangala broth
Now for the poultry id say hoot hoot would be amazing because its really big
So a petal that you can dry out and then consume and it gives you lots of energy? That's a real thing. It's a cacao plant and it's the raw natural ingredient if cocaine
Magicharp is edibl
Michael you have to act fast because Grunty Boi threatened my bloodline and told me to tell you that he would send this video of yours to that vegan teacher if you didn't retire Team Sky I am genuinely trembling at the thought of all this
OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! WHERE IS POKEMON TALK?!
i would love bouffalant milk
no wonder grunty boi is part of team rocket he interrupts my video >:(
.....I just released you look just like another YouTuber, task and purpose
Not my dear Farfetch'd 😭
As a boston resident its more of an “uh” sound when saying Chowder (Chowduh)
grunty boy I don't think grass exists I have played too much minecraft pvp to ever see it again
The moment you sed sukkels juice I latht so  hard
I love fish where is the fish
ITS ALEAYS RAYCON (AND RAID) im actually getting angry   And what did GRUNTY BOI? Wut
Vanillite,Vanillish,Vanilluxe
All my friends jumped off a cliff... that means many people do it... So it must be safe!
I knew my favourite Pokémon would be here at some point.
i want to dislike this but i cant
Eat Pikachu
Eating combusken legs would be the equivalent of eating buffalo chicken wings
Nikey 👍
Pokémon rights groups don’t exist able to participate in dogfights starring Pokémon
Pokémon xvz Kian
As a person from Boston with heavy accent relatives i can say you did it right although i dont have an accent myself so i can't be to certain
Milk Miltank first before you kill her
What about magikarp?
Man grunty boy hasn’t touched or seen grass in a while 😂💀
And also leave the apple out of this it has like a 🐛🐛🐛
Leave The flowers  out of this
"I want shuckle's juice"
How about octilory
Here in Australia, Kangaroo is, obviously, quite common. It is very difficult to cook. If you don't cook it properly, you are eating it either too raw or it's way overcooked, so I get it. It's a bit full on, you don't need much of it thats for sure.
"I would eat Combusken with ranch dressing" 😏
Haven't you made this video before?
I know this kind of sounds stupid but her me out. Kling, klang and kling klang. They have all the iron that my body will ever need.
90% of fish pokemon would be good to eat
Man you really hate Miltank don’t you?!?! 😂🤣
When you talk about Appletun, Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist, Unfezant, and Happiny, you ending lines are so funny! It’s your delivery that makes them. Plus, just casually talking about do a séance during the Pumpkaboo/Gourgeist segment was kinda funny. This whole really had me laughing hard!
You missed magikarp it's literally a regular fish and would probably be good in sushi
What about elcreme
13:38 Your delivery with stuff like this makes it all the funnier! 😂
You don’t like ice cream? You don’t like vanilla ice cream?
guardivuair
At pig part I was like “miltank” and then ohhhhh he doesn’t like it
Mmmm.... Whipped alcreamy with pumpkaboo pie.
I would have eaten vanillite.
I have tried one at a first Americans museum in Oklahoma City. And I mean buffalo burger.
"I'll eat his mom though" take it out of context
I'd eat bulbasaur and squirtle
I think that kaw kaw I’m a reshiram would be good
Oh no way, I eat too! What are the chances!
I'm glad you didn't include Fidough, it is too precious to be eaten.
Combees honey
Wigellet I would eat it
GO THROUGH YOUR SUBREDDIT I POSTED TWICE AND PEOPLE POSTED TEAM SKY APPLICATIONS
I would eat alcreamia pumpkaboo pie or gigantamax alcremie
Comebee😊
Shuckle…makes booze and gets around censorship. “Delicious fermented juice” is alcohol…
You would eat… Snover’s berries? 🤨
I’m vegetarian
Slurpuff is wet cotton candy, If you don't skip grunty boi 👇
what about the vanillite line? its just ice but you can mix it with chocolate or any fruit to add taste which is how some types of ice cream are made
6:13 and too cute!
Vullaby Turkey yum yum
I think Stunfisk would be delicious too
I heard there was a species of tortoise called the Giant Tortoise that was so edible that researchers couldn't even bring it home to study; they had to eat them on the way because they were so edible and delicious.
The pokemon you talked about are all fine and dandy. But there are plenty of other options if you're willing to try. Some countries eat Alligator. Or was it crocodile? We have a couple pokemon for that.  Frankly any of the bird looking pokemon are potentially viable food options. Birds are birds. And just because the dex doesn't specify anything regarding taste, it doesn't mean other bird mon couldn't taste good.   I'd 100% eat Octillery.  Can we take a minute and talk about how tasty Snorlax would likely be? A big fat and lazy creature like that would have very fatty meat to enjoy.  Pokemon like Zigzagoon would be viable as well. In real life, road kill is safe to eat as long as it's internals haven't been exposed yet.   Some people eat snake and so the snake pokemon are viable in a pinch.  The dog and cat pokemon are reasonable too. Heck, you could eat a Rapidash. Some countries in the World serve horse meat...
My name is also Michael and ya I agree with you  pumpkin spice is pretty good
charubys ball, charums balls, snovers berries, tinymo is too tiny. all quotes said by mikey
Appletun secrets a nectar on its back that’s what the children eat not it’s skin
I’m from Louisiana any Pokémon would be fair game.
Touch grass lol
Vanillite. Definitely vanillite.
Imagine miltank cheese burgers existing edit: why hasn’t someone liked or commented yet, I am surprised it’s been nine months since video release
Please do "is it pokemon or is it mozart" reaction.
YOU FORGOT VANNILITE
He somehow missed the literal ice-cream pokemon. Other than that, yeah, all good picks.
3:23 someone clip this for a no context reel. It's... reel good, heh.
Watching this video made me crave bison burgers. And I’ll join you on the Miltank train
Mikey hate to break it to you but there’s a pumpkin shortage
vitamin BEE
Shuckle wee
Micheal why hasn’t there been Pokémon talk for like 4 years
Ok honelessly I would make Torcick into Torcick nuggets.
4:48 why is scarlet witch playing raid shadow legends
I would love to eat lopunny or gardevoar
PILOWSWINE!!
BROOO?! WHY WOULD YOU EAT MY FAVORITE POKEMON?!
Imagine eating eevee 😔
I wonder what  Too sweet for human consumption means   Like does it just destroy your skin immediately
Sorry im late i was busy studying and every time you upload a smile comes to my face I have been watching you for 5 years now keep on going
What about bird pokemon ;_;
"I'm not gonna eat bambi. I'll eat his mom tho." hmm.. 🤔
Vanilite
Charizard tail ITS ALREADY HEATED UP
Hear me out:xernias-now now I know it's a legendary but...its a deer so venison first of all. And with xernias's healing properties you could have a delicious healing venison
That's good and all but when is the next pokemon talk? Or is it canceled son?
Octillery and grapploct be like
You sure have broken the forth wall: you can’t eat pokemon    Unless your team rocket
Plus I hate it so I would get to enjoy its flavor and demise god Mikey has got savage intentions
Ash and Brock daydreamed of eating Magikarp, From what I saw in their thought bubble I would most likely to eat Magikarp.
Vespiqueen
What about seaking
Wouldn’t pumpkaboo and gourabyss be hollow
Forgot about Dwebble and Crustle when talking about crabs. Dex doesn’t really talk about eating them, but they’re crustaceans so they probably taste good lol
Bu- Bu- Cute Pumpkaboo with a hat... Pumpkaboo are friemds. not food
How did you miss the Vanillite line?
03:23 Peter Griffin moment
Appletun is basically 🍎🥧 so fruit not 🥩
You know I always rationalize it as Team Rocket cutting the tail off at a point that doesn't grow back.
I had a whole ass moment thinking about eating that giant crab pokemon I saw crawling on a mountain side in a clip once (during this video, not when I saw it originally lol) a crab that size must have so much tasty meat in it 🤤🤤🤤
Eating a haunted pumpkin is like the fastest way to get possessed lol. Imagine having to go out on a ghost hunt to find one, exorcise it, then make pumpkin pie with it. What a workout for some pie
Imma be honest here and try to say something about Mikey not wanting to eat lechonk... I know of a Spanish Dish of wholly roasted pig and it's called lechon... See where I'm going with this?
I’m doing a bug types only run, and I’m gonna wait to do the finals in wyndon until my snom evolves and also stealth rocks trivialize kabu
I think Wiglett would taste like noodles😂
I’m surprised he didn’t mention magikarp it was dreamed about being eaten in the anime
I laughed at the Bambi joke I feel bad
you forgot the vannilux line
I feel like if I feel like if pokemon where real Mikey would single handedly painfully murder EVERY miltank
Quilfish and overquil
Wouldn’t Torchick taste like a chicken nugget?
It would be fun to see you play with only food Pokémon as a Baker Trainer
There was a small fish that i think evolved and became many small fish that are moving as one big fish and i would deep fry them so they become "tsatsa" and would eat them every day all the time
DIGGLET MEAT
Imagine if grunty boi pops up in a non sponsored video
What if the Miltank runs away...
3:22 "I will eat his mom tho"
Ok listen I’m sorry but if you were to slow slow SLOW cook snorlax, it would be divine. The meat would be as soft as a tissue(pun intended), the berries probably had some effect on snorlax and made it healthy(ish) and I heard of people eating bear meat so dig in to a feast if snorlax  Edit: ok also I forgot to mention that if you slow cook very fatty meat, it melts off and makes the meat so soft
Have you tried Pumpkin Bread?? Cuz it's my FAVORITE dessert ever!
“I haven’t seen grass, it’s blue right?” 💀
is it just me or is this REALLY sus with u know
Bro sinistea
bro forgot he can make miltank wayyyyyy less disturbing buy cutting its floppy nipples
10:00
I would eat miltank too I hate it and it traumatized me for give milk to a cyndiacill from that 1 episode in the anime I would devour a miltank burger in an instant
Has anyone noticed that grunty boy has the same voice as Squirtle from Pokemon talk
what about hoothoot? its just a big owl lollypop
you missed the fish
Smolive is an olive and I love olives.
Pokemon:  Gonna taste em' all!!  One pokemon i would eat more than anything is Lopunny. You've seen their Thickness? They're packed with ton of juicy meat!! Plus, Rabbit meat is perfect for a stew during winter. And with the fur, i would make a comfy fluffy coat, so nothing go to waste. Don't deny it, you too would want to have a roasted Loppuny on a stick, mixed in a stew or better, served whole with an apple in her mouth and dipped in bbq sauce.   Now that i've said that, i'm suddenly craving of rabbit meat...
You look much happier and are having more fun with your videos, keep it up!
Eldegoss' seeds attached to it's cotton are nutritious to both people and pokemon.
i would eat gardivoir...dont ask me why tho...;)
No mention of the Vanillish line? None at all??
I still consider eating slowpoke tails wrong cause every time somebody in a newer game mentions eating them I remember how morally abhorrent it was originally portrayed. Also don’t hurt the head empty Pokémon
Bassimians fruit it holds in its hand!
3:20 MandJTV:I'm not eating Bambi,I'll eat his mum though Bambi fans:You MONSTER!!!!!!!!
What the hell
The 🍦Pokémon
sprow
I love how grunty boy's entrance went from  WHO ARE YOU to Hey man
Lavender is used as a Bug repellent and is a really good and tasty tea
E!!!!!!!
One wird for ya KRABBY
And also thank you I now know what to eat in Pokémon! And Real Life!
You missed ghastly because the souls of the innocent taste AMAZING! Edit: 1 spammer removed
How long have you been back on youtube i missed alot
Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist... Are some of my favorite pokemon... Even then, I cannot disagree with how happy Mike is when he discusses eating them... Well done, sir!
mikey be like "I WANNA DRINK SHUCKLE JUICE"
i like how mikey didnt mention vanilish vanilite or vaniluxe
Also this is like a remake of a video he made a few years ago actually!
“Farfetch’d, a wild duck Pokémon, is very good when cooked with leek. Due to this, *farfetch’d is nearly e x t i n c t.”* -Dexter, idk what year
Easily the best Grunty Boi promo.
You should do a video where you eat food off the pokemon you would eat like madgicart make it look like whay ou think it would look like or what the show shows
I would like to eat is madgicarp
NO MICHAEL     DONT EAT EELEKTROSS
Can we get another team sky video where you’re in unova maybe?
Grunty Boy is correct, Grass is Blue
I was kinda thinking that you would say that you would drink miltank’s blood as well :D But sure miltank milk would be good too
This reminds me of one of my favourite Pokémon journeys episodes, where Jessie and James almost eat an appletun and vanillite because morpeko keeps eating their food
What about Polteageist and Smoliv? Also, I think some fish pokemon would be great too.
Rip my man pumpkaboo
The vanniluxe line
Mikey you literally forgot Vanillite, they had a ice cream shop in B&W games !
Mandjtv I LOVE CALAMARI TOO
The real question is, would you eat a shiny?
Lechonk is probably getting an evolution, i think that would make great jamón serrano
Anyone remember that video that had the same premise(something like "top 10 pokemon most delicious pokemon") and really uncomfortably described eating Miltank? Pretty sure Tepig and Krabby were also on the list.
Carvana Sharpeido
Now, would you eat spicy Moltres wings?
not watching the video, just leaving a dislike for how downright horrible of a concept this is  "playfully morally gray" does not properly encapsulate how genuinely demented it is to kill and eat the bodies of sentient, living creatures
Mikey is a Pumpkin Spice Basic Beeyotch?
As I have seen if wigglet is edible its evolution would probably be the #1 food in gen 9, as normally it is long, if it evolved it would be x2 food or something like that.     (Also, Gen 9 is my favorite generation cause I live in Spain :D)
I hadn't realized how many dex entries talk about eating pokemon
"I Would eat it EVERY DAY" that means miltank would kill you from a heart attack lol
I would eat ho oh
You prob won’t see this but clam pearl is a fish egg
was that a mom joke?
I think that combees honey would be as delitious as normal honey well it is a honeycomb with a face so yum
There must be a bunch of grass type Pokemon you can turn into rice or pasta or bread, right?
I have a challenge try to beat Pokémon let’s go with only one caterpie that can’t evolve
Eh, a plant being both a bug repellant and edible isn't that weird. Catnip actually has insect repellant properties and you can make it into tea.
I think gogoat milk would be interesting to try
Vanilite
Hey during the 'THE INCIDENT' did a bear attack you or some thing
Thx a lot mnjtv
What the sus
Hi
"Im not gonna eat Bambi, I'll eat his mom tho"  -Mandjtv 2022
As someone planning a food-based team for the Path of Legend, thank you for the inspiration!
so when the vegan teacher gonna attack Mikey
Clearly you never tried a pumpkin and pork rib stew!
The Vanillite line sounds good to eat, I mean who doesn't love ice-cream?
I'm not eating Mambi.   I'll eat his mom though   Roflmao
Weird aside, but the concept of blue used to include green, and in Japanese what we would call "green vegetables" are known as "blue vegetables". So yes, grass is actually blue (in the context of the history of colors).
You fool if you fry him or her will evolve to blazakin 6:20
I think Sinistea and Polteageist would be good since they are tea
i just got a peta ad while watching this I think they know
NO MIKEY YOU FORGOT FIDOUGH
Would you eat Bulbasaur’s bulb? Reply below!
Try pumpkin seed soup it's said to be very good
7:10 HOW COULD YOU EAT JACKIE LEGS!?!? Let alone be compelled to try it in the first place?
Would you like pumpkin soup?
As soon as I saw the title, I knew there will be Gardevoir, Lopunny or Vaporeon, But it turns out that Mikey has a clean mind and I have a dirty one
3:22   "I'll eat his mom though"  —Michael  "hail yeah" Groth
Vanilish and it's familly maybe
I'm surprised Lopunny wasn't on the list. people eat rabbit meat, and I'm sure Lopunny would have enough meat to be considered a meal. (Also it would've been funny as a joke entry, but that's beside the point)
As for ones (besides Oddish) that I'd totally eat, that you didn't mention: Rabbit's supposedly pretty tasty, so Buneary, Bunnelby, Scorbunny, and possibly Raboot. Not Digersby, 'cause that thing looks gross. Not Lopunny because it only evolves if you're its friend, and friends are not food. Cinderace seems like its meat would be a bit too tough, though I suppose if you slow roasted it, that'd be fine.  Similarly, crocodile's said to be pretty good (even the great, big ones that you'd think would be all tough and gamey), so the Totodile and Sandile lines, for sure.  Although *you* wouldn't eat Exeggcute, I totally would! Sure, it's not eggs, it's seeds...but both forms of Exeggutor are very obviously based on one of the two known variants of the coconut palm tree, and do you know what the seeds of such trees are? The coconuts! Which means Exeggcute are clusters of coconuts!
I’m Australian and kangaroo is alright
Also, you missed a pretty great option in the vegetable category: Oddish's name comes from the fact that it is an odd radish! And radishes are pretty great.
Also, pumpkin only tastes weird in combination with savory things, if you're adding in the clove and nutmeg and cinnamon to make it pumpkin *spiced* savory things. Pumpkin on its own tastes like spaghetti squash, so it combines perfectly fine with savory foods. That's what pumpkin soup is all about.
That Pokedex entry about Farfetch'd being an endangered species, didn't originate in the anime. It originated in the gen 1 games, which-at least in Japan-came before the anime.
3:20 Take that out of context
What a great video idea. I hate it, thanks. I hope nobody eats my friends next time I start a Pokémon game
I won't eat Bambi... but I'll eat his mom though - MandJTV 2022
Mandjtv somehow offended jaiden by eating blazikens prevolution
By the way, you've been pronouncing Alcremie wrong. It's pronounced "AL-kruh-mee". It's a play on the word "alchemy"
3:23 clip that
What about vanilite, vanillish and vanilluxe? They're basically just ice cream with spiky ice toppings
what about gator meat
12:49 oh my god that accent that you just did was one of the funniest accents you have ever made in your YouTube career! Lol!
Diglet it is hot dogs
I would eat all of these
Michigan upper peninsula go to white tail best bison pastes around
I’ll take those facts to the diner table, and Granty boy can you do more magic on you next sponsor please I thought to was a cool transition.
Contest idea to do Against Pokeman7, Best Pokemon (Sword/Shield) Best Pokemon of a certain number in it's Dex-Number (Example: Start with 1, then choose a pokemon that have that number I it's Dex-Number)
More meme reviews
No Combee honey?
Nice shirt Mikey
Careful with ribombee, it can make both delicious and disgusting pollen puffs.
One of my my favorite starter Pokémon septile is my real favorite
I have I small question on Pokémon talk it said nobody is talking about treeko being there favorite he is my favorite Pokémon
Why not bad to Legion
You missed the Vanillite line
The ice cream pokemon get some flavoring and you got a good snack on a hot summer day
😂😂😂😂😂
Vanlice is literally ice cream.
I have never tried crab meat but if I was in the pokemon world I would eat it 100%
Isn’t shinnatc the Pokémon that sucks the life out of you I wounded what will happen if you eat it
I mean I will eat them all if I go to a poke mart
smolive, furdough, vanilite line
what about magikarp you can also eat that as well and maybe octillery since that's also an octopus so maybe more calamari
Hmm I would eat a Scorbunny
Pumpkin Pie.
Yeti Crabs aren't exactly edible per se, so I'd stay away from Crabominable
CHARIZARD
Vanillite
Well on my side of the world it is kind of blue like it isn't called Bluegrass estate for nothing
How about a cup of Sinistea or Polteageist? :P
I wouldn't be able to eat any pokemon that aren't related to cow,fish,chicken or birds,otherwise it would be like eating a dog
Great video, hilarious sponsoring skit, and an incredible and beautiful thumbnail. One of my favorite videos of yours.
3:22  Out of context "I'll eat its mom though"
Grunty BOi is right, there is grass that is somewhat buleish
what about fidough? lmao
Bison is delicious
I love the pumpkaboo part! Super funny! I am a huge fan of pumpkin flavor too!
So vanillite
Genuinely surprised Vanillite's evolution line wasn't here. Aside frm lactose intolerant ppl, who DOESN'T like a good ice cream cone? 😌🍦
Sharpedo for some shark fin soup
3:23 SUS
How did this dude really forget vanillux, it’s literally just ice cream
Funny you Mention Kangaroo meat. Being from Australia I have had Kangaroo quite alot at home as its cheapish. It is very difficult to cook though but when its cooked right it is delicious, so tender and melt in your mouth, i would highly recommend it (kangaroo carpaccio is amazing). It is unfortunately really easy to cook it too far and have it just become leathery and horribly chewy.
I would have expected for you to finish with "Gotta eat 'em all" instead, LOL
Slowpokes tail grows back
”Lets do some fruits and veggies” proceeds to name a mushroom
I want to see a Pokémon game that is in Hiroshima and rest of the areas that was impacted from the 2 bombs in Japan. So Team Rocket wants too make people or the grunts have pokemon powers to help them to rule the region .But this experiment went horribly wrong and people started too become pokemon! So you need to save the region and stop the radioactive pokemon waste everywhere! And too stop Team rocket turning everyone into pokemon! But there’s one more feature you can become pokemon also! And then you start a whole new storyline! Helping you pokemon bros to rule the world!
Tbh you probably eat Drowzee, but not in the traditional way ;)
The Vanilish line. Partly out of spite (like Mikey and Miltank)
ok but the ice cream pokemon like also Slurpuff is a cream puff also also Executors coconuts .. and supposedly Octillary's ink can be turned into a sauce to prepare on fish
I'm shocked at the lack of mention of Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe. They're all literally ice cream! And if you wouldn't eat them or don't like ice cream then I'm still surprised that you didn't at least mention them at the end with the other Pokémon that are literally just sentient food
i cant imagine anything being weaker than a pokemon made out of whipped cream
Mmmmm vegan chickerita nugget
MandJTV: I'm not gonna eat bambi, I'll eat his mom though. Me: AYO.
It make sense it you try to eat Mamoswine, you will be something next meal not the Mamoswine.
Your to go label
Magikarp tbh sounds nice grilled
give grunty boy a mill tank
i feel like the pokemon company would reflect on what they made and did after watching this
Forgot about drowzee 🙈
Hail yeah 🌨️☀️🌧️
Truegreen7 made a legendary form of castform
i love usfeznt my loving bird pokemon
here's a video idea: if every rival was champion! May should ABSOLUTLEY use venusaur and blastoise cuz she had a venusaur and squirtle in the anime
Have you ever tried kangaroo, it’s amazing and a must try(if it’s leagal where you live)
Your a wizard Grunty!
3:25 at first I Lough. Than it was wierd...
Morepeko has this yummy thing in its front pocket
This video is just an excuse for Mikey to show his hate on Miltank.
I think you missed fidough I know it would be hard to eat such a cute pokemon but if you just put it in an oven I think it would make some really good bread
Grunty boy is now a pro gamer
You forgot the ice cream cones. They should be edible too...
Honestly surprised to not see the vanillite family on here lol
Grunty Boi: Thats what I call a pro gamer move Everyone of Mikeys audience: HE SAID THE THING
What about Ditto? Being able to transform into any pokemon gives it my top vote for the best edible pokemon. Followed by the Vanillite line since they are literally ice cream. Also, a honey glazed talonflame entreé sounds delightful. Mike, I would advise also trying Grapploct since it is basically another form or an octopus.
He actually did it, He admitted Exeggacute are seeds
I'm surprised you didn't mention the vaniluxe line.  They're literally ice cream.
Who else here would eat gardevour?
The thumbnail is so mikey
Combusken = a chick that shapes like a .......
you missed the vaniluxxe line
I would eat sceptile 😏
Mikey you could gigantsmax some Pokémon for more food like creamy and snorlax
How long will the code for earbuds be valid? Because I want to add the earbuds  to my christmass list.
after this video i saw mikeys if i were a gym leader and i think he should play the fan rom the gym of mine
I'm calling the police
Bounsweet sweat?? why not go all the way down and try some of dat Tserena sweat good lawd😩
Pumpkins 🎃
I don't know really that this Pokemon will taste good or bad  And also l don't know pokedex so........  And this are from anime  I think that grotle nuts are eatable                    AND Bulbasaur honey from back can be eatable
HE MISSED VANILITE😭😭 THE FOOD POKEMON
What are your thoughts on octillery??
I hope team sky reaches unova , kalos , alola and galar too
Looks like Grunty Boi needs to go out and Touch Grass
Vanillite maybe?
How did you manage to exclude every Pokemon from the vanillux line
What about the Vanillite line? They're literally ice cream with faces!
oddish is the weed pokemon.  snatch some off the top of its head and roll it up 🔥
no magikarp sashimi?
mint is widely considered to be a bug repellent so its not strange that you could drink petilil tea despite it having that effect
Fidough
blazkin will kick your face in
Scientists: I’ve found the meaning of life! Mikey: Fry it and let me eat it.
Speak for your self I’d eat mewtwo. Don’t ask.
Unless the Pokemon World has a Steer variant of Miltank, then maybe THAT'D be taking into consideration... As for the other Pokemon, those all make sense. But don't forget to take Milcery, Alcremie and Fidough into consideration as well! Milcery and Alcreamie's whipped cream can be used in baking, which was shown in the anime when Alcremie's whip cream was used for the Whipped Cream Curry and during the baking competition, while Fidough's yeast can be used for baking pastries and breads.
Give every karen an egg if it turns them nice and pleasant
About the tea also being able to repel bugs.. lemongrass is a common herb humans use in cooking and tea that can also be used to deter mosquitos and though it does not harm or deter honeybees it can be used to protect honeybees from the mites that have been endangering them
I NEED GOOD FORTUNE HALF THE TIME I WANT TO DIE
What about the rabbits? Scorbunny stew anyone?
You forgot the literal ice cream Pokemon vanillish
huh i guess grunty boi is a wizard now
what about fidough? i know it kinda looks a bit much like a dog but it's bread :V and i think it'd be pretty tasty lathered with a light spread of butter or with cinnamon and sugar
Blazeken is too kick my ass
What about the literal ice cream pokemon? Or would that just taste like ice?
Imagine someone in the pokemon world started smoking petillils and they become the new villian the player has to stop
What about majickarp and I heard Asians eat bugs so sislapied sorry if I spelled it wrong but the fire bug from gen8
If you don’t want miltanks milk then just use gogoat, or skidoos milk because in the anime they are known for making milk and some of the kalos regions cheeses and ice cream
Some of rabbit and squirrel mons
Is there a winner dof the John Michael cup. If so I'm having a hard time finding the video.
Pichu be looking mad tasty
You wouldn't eat the ice cream cone pokemon?
Man, don't eat Alcremie. If you keep it alive, it'll keep making you more perfectly edible whipped cream.
Pumpkin cheeseburger
You don't need the Dex to know how Shuckle makes juice. That's just a game mechanic.
charzard so grass can go more popular
Rack of lamb is good
WOAH DONT EAT HER MOM
Aint we gon talk about Mickey not wanting to choke on things?
There is also Ursaring. Bear meat is good
Since you like pumpkin spice so much have you ever tried pumpkin spice milk?
Feesh
You forgot hoot hoot I would
Bison is great
So glad you explained your choices.
Pilloswine bacon sounds amazballs
3:40 why not miltank milkshake
Content is pretty bad do more of then and now types
The literal ice cream pokemon Vanillite, Vanillish and Vanilluxe?
Imagine eating a majicarp and it evolves into garadoss before you can cook it
If you gmax it will be so much better.
@MandJTV I am looking to start a poketuber youtube channel, what site do you use when doing a nds or 3ds rom?
3:39 *cough* *cough* sausage
So, fun fact about Shuckle - it was actually based on snake wine, which is wine fermented with a snake in it (a traditional practice from China).  The beta design of Shuckle is simply a snake head poking out of a jar, its "legs" were much smaller and looked like part of the "jar".  For whatever reason, this design, like many others in Gen 2, was toned down to make it a vaguely turtle-like creature, but the stuff about it fermenting fruit in its shell remained.
I ate lamb only few times in kebab and it's great, not as good as kebab with beef but for sure better than with chicken. So Dubwool come here to my plate, Wooloo and Mareep are to small for me, while Flaaffy and by extantion possibly also Ampharos have rubbery skin and that would make them harder to prepare imo.
No bug pokemon?
People eat turtles I don't remember if dex entries say they aren't edible
What about the ice creams? Vanillish, vanilluxe…
I'm sure Mikey would love to get some fresh miltank milk, just like that cindaquill
Hey I just saw the you have an Austin FC shirt on. Wicked!!!!
Pincurchin is just like uni!!!
that's why you spin to evolve milkery as its cream so your wipping it up to make alcreamy im mindblown🤯🤯🤯
React to greavard trailer!
Ash ate some snover's berries
Sir did u read torchic and his entries of them
You seem to have forgotten the two ice cream pokemon. You know. Vanilla in their names, just add some flavouring if you dont like vanilla
Where’s Hypno
Wiglit it's a sausage and I love sausages
He would eat miltank to exterminate the species
Charizard and fossil pokemon (exluding Kabuto) i asume are delicious but probably high in protein.
Weird and funny
Vanillite, vanillish and vanilluxe. Ice cream with faces.
Michael, I need your opinion. Do you think I should rebuy a 3DS etc with Pokémon bank on it or do you think Pokémon will do the same thing they did with gen 1&2 and  the 3DS and do virtual console games for all the pre switch games and allow it to be transferable to Home
You should shave your beard
never thought pokemon would make me hungry haha
3:20 Excuse me WHAT DID HE SAY
What about frogs?
gator meat?  also, if you had to pick, which legendary/mythical would you nom?
8:49 They did, until Drampa came for them 😂
My dad's favourite meat is lamb. Wooloo and Mareep would thank you.
Vanilluxe is literally ice cream
We NEED more team sky
The Vegan Teacher gonna have a field day...
Don't worry guys! It's just Drowzee showing us Michael's wettest dream of eating pokemon.
so he dosent like icecream.
Why not Vanillite and its evolution line?
iwith the seafood clauncher and clawitzer would be my favorite since they are way more based on shrimps and not krabs
it takes a sick mind to think this up
3:21-you heartless monster!!
I mean it makes sense i love my dog and my cousin has a pet pig which is adorable but i still eat pig just not the pig i care about
Not sure if you'd eat it, but one you never mentioned anything that could be edible is Combee.
meanwhile every vegetarian and pokemon lowers seeing this vid 🤮 🤮
"I'm not gonna eat bambi. I'll eat his mom though." You just cause my brother vietnam flashes to his Bambi trauma and it was great. xD
what  about the icecream pokemon
No ice cream pokemon??
perhaps sausages from miltanks sausage nipples?
Frog legs,pigeon,octillery,remoraid,covid bats,cactus juice
I absolutely adore Grunty Boi's efforts to appear with a different fabulous flair every time. This time is no exception.
Fidough, Smoliv, Lechonk And Fuecoco Would Make A Mean Spanish Breakfast
Gardevoir.
I agree with most but not all I'll cream you think will be the last Pokemon I would dare put my hands on not only is it  adorable but you cannot put on your pumpkin pie the thing about like this I like the rest you can probably easily kill them for your meals this one you can't easily do that cuz it's cream there's no vital organs he kill it with I don't even know if you could kill sentient cream so either we leave that creamy bee or a whole monster cuz you're eating while it's sentient have that food for thought as you are seeing how creamy scream on your plate good day gentlemen I had a horrible traumatizing thought and now I bestow it on to all of you as a wise grunty once said Tata Tata
We dont have to eat plant pokemon because we already have non living plants in pokemon
Love the video and keep up the great work
Let's hope the Vegan Teacher never watches this video!!!!!!!
Feabas and magikarp meat because the are fish
I would invest in slaughterhouses for miltank
I am suprised you didn’t talk about THE LITERAL ICE CREAM VANILUXE
How about the frogs man 😂
Wow I didn't think mickey would slurp on militant everyday
This is one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in a long time 😂
What about pumpkin chocolate with a hint of caffeine
Yiu forgot Magikarp
Farfetch’d doesn’t have be put in a sandwich. He is the sandwich GOOD DAY SIR
du machst leute hungrig xD
Now when you are vegetarian like me the pokemon would probably eat me lol.
Pumpkaboo and its evolution likely aren't edible pumpkins. There's multiple different types, bred specifically for one purpose or the other. The pumpkins bred for carving, like the pumpkins these Pokémon inhabit, are not bred to be consumed, and thus don't have a pleasant taste and are a bit dry. Pie pumpkins, on the other hand, have thicker guts and a better taste. That's just my understanding, at least
Would Alcreamie whipped cream counteract the possible curses in a Pumpkaboo pie? I mean it’s ghost vs fairy…
2:20 - 2:49 bro I like piggy’s not them….
Swanna
Pokemon that can eat you. Next hehe
Thanks for the Pokémon world survival guide
I think you forgot rabbit meat like rabbot and ice cream like vanillish
What about smolive wouldn't that just be like olives???
You forget about vanilluxe
This is a great video! I know it’s more on the scripted side, but it seems a lot more natural. That hiatus really worked!
I’m allergic to apples
damn your going through a mid  life crisis early
Ya missed the ice-cream
the remake we didnt need but the remake we deserve
Vanillix
Appleton is a dessert
Pumpkin spiced miltank?🙃
Scarlet and Violet sandwich guide. Noice
Loved this video would love to see PM7 react to this video
What about the ice cream pokemons
scrumptious
hey, i remember that Tauros is one of your favorite pokemon, so why do you want to eat their meat? you only contribute to their faster extinction!
What about squirtle for turtle soup? And why not octillery for calamari? Or magikarp?
Whipped Alcremie on Pumpkapoo Pie sounds amazeballs
Magickarp
Fidough i think you could just make a delicious cake from. I mean its fi-dough
I do admit the premise of this is weird, but funny.  Also the Grunty Boy segment was hilarious this time around! Though if he has magic that might be a problem.
vanilluxe?
when it dex entry says children eat appletun's skin, it might be harmless to appletun, cause the "skin" that it mentions in the dex could be talking about its scales since its part dragon type(?), and the scales could be edible?? idk, sounded plausible in my mind
I’d eat pikachu that bastard has gotten way to much attention
Dude I love your Austin fc shirt
WHERE IS FIDOUGH, I WANT MY PASTRY!!!!!!
I would like to eat Fidough's bread because , ITS BREAD ! Moltres ( Yeah I know its a legendary but still ) because I am a KFC enjoyer . Vanillux because its summer where I live.  And finally, Gyaragos because : 1. Its feesh  2.All hail Feesh 3.Mega Gyaragos looks like a giant shrimp
i mean the only reason battles arnt ban is bc pokemon have human level smarts to some point so they can choose to fight or not  but at the same time id eat some pokemeat
Mikey talking about wanting to consume Shuckle's juice, meanwhile Drowzee with a dark cloud of depression over its head.
I think vanilluxe would be great in a hot summer day.
You missed vinliec line
Oddish look like an onion soo go for it gigatamax snorlax is the berries form the tree
What about the ice cream pokemon? Vanilluxe. It looks delicious to try
I’d like to put wooloo in a slow cooker.
Literally everything he says sounds so wrong
Yes grunty boi my boy grass is blue
Vanillite?? Ice cream
Petilil leaf tea counteracting fatigue and working as a bug repellent makes sense actually since caffeine naturally evolved in certain plants as a form of bug repellent
Would you eat Wiglett. It's an eel
You missed one the literal ice cream Pokemon wait
I feel like the stuff on an Appletons back is just like shead skin that it uses as armor so I think it would be fine to eat.
I’d eat magicarp, even though it’s scales might be hard it’s still a carp, and James even activity tried to eat one in the the gem 1 anime
I'm guessing Plurplecliffe's list would just be gardevoir
emergency fud
Croconaw and feraligator tails sound delicious
(*clears throat*) feesh
So about Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist: The pumpkins we use for jack-o-lanterns are not the same breed of pumpkin used for pies and other food products. They're still edible but they do not taste good. As for combining pumpkin with meat...you know pumpkin is basically a kind of squash  right? There's loads of recipes that combine meat and squash.
so you *wouldn't* eat maractus?
Beraskuda might need to be prepared right since beracudas are toxic to humans unless you prepare it right but I'm down for it
Grumpig would beg you to not kill it while using telepathy and looking into your eyes
not sorry but i would consume EVERY jigglypuff, maybe some Squirtle and a side of chansey with the egg but without is fine too
Dude bla skin is literally cooking itself the best instant food
Forgot Fidough
MmMmM
Reminds me of the first time we had Venison as kids, our dad didn't tell us what it was until after we finished. My sisters, who was probably 6ish at the time, response? "Bambi tastes good!"
where's klefki?
“Playfully morally grey”  No, this is very seriously morally gray
Regice cubes???
Vanillite line? If they're not ice cream, they are at least snow cones that you could flavor. Ooh vanilluxe with shuckle juice syrup and alcremie whipped cream.
Love your videos
Micheal being hilarious for 15 mins straight, also where is Fidough?
Grunty boi is wrong grass is actually pink
"I'll eat his mom, though" Mikey 2022  I think the Appletun skin wanders into dessert territory... but what do I know. lol  Also EWW pumpkin is gross.  What about Vanillite/Vanillish/Vanilluxe???
If Unfezant tastes like actually pheasant, it'd be a good choice.  Although I think actual pheasants are more plump?
eiscues ice face... it replenishes so i mean you could shave it off to turn into snowcones :)
Fidough's evolution. probably?
It’s so funny how he is so happy to eat Miltank just bc of his passionate hatred for it
I think Vanillux would be good
Maybe add a gator for jerky
I'd so eat the Skiddo and Wooloo lines
For eel Pokémon to eat wigglet is also an ell so it would make for a nice treat
O come on! Torchic is the nuggets, combuscikn is the strips and blazakin is the spicy 12 count drum bucket!
What about the ice cream pokemon, vanilite, vanilish and vaniluxe??
You love pumpkin you would love my mom‘s pumpkin fluff. LOL it’s kind of like frosting and you dip graham crackers, apples and vanilla wafers in it.
I recommend for you mikey to watch the food theory because they also cover about pokemon eating.  Ps:I always love your content and it is our prelim exam now I watch your video instead of reviewing lol
I think cutting off a slowpoke tail will prevent it from evolving.
Combee?
You probably should have put in a category for dessert like Vanillite and other dessert Pokémon
Yes grass is blue and the sky is pink
You are very funny and I love your energy!
I think hoothoot meat would be delicious, as seen in matpat's video, hoothoot is the biggest and fattest regional bird, and i love poultry and bird meat!
wha-what about charmander lizzard meat😔
Day 7 of asking for a Team Rocket version of Mytey for Grunty Boi
bonus with the alcremie you dont even have to kill it as it willingly shares its cream with its trainer as seen in pokemon master journeys episode called the sweet taste of battle
Pumpkin milktack
I'd wanna pop open a bag of lightly salted Sunkern to crack 'n' snack on a road trip
mikeyy dont say youd eat a cloyster just look at it
i like to eat oricorio, tocanon, and fralligator mainly because i love chicken and i would really love to try some gator
I feel like Dragonite meat would probably be amazing
you’ll never get my juice
Isn't vanillalite an ice cream cone?
Pumpkaboo pumpkin pie with alcreamy whipped cream
Rip jaiden animations favorite Pokémon
now we know mikey is 30% instagram mom
Can’t forget Gmax Alcreme. It’s literally a Giant CAKE
Mikey: I would eat bounsweet, but only its sweat me:FBI OPEN UP! *click* bon voyage me Mikey! *BOOM*
Listo! (A) Great video (B) Awesome Austin FC shirt! Can't wait to watch the team go to the western playoff finals. Being from the Austin area, it is awesome to see you support the team.
So you don't like ice cream? 🍨🍦🍨
Miltank is a tank of a pokemon just use it on ur team!
Hey Mickey... Why don't you try playing "Pokemon This Gym of Mine" it's a game that makes you a Gym Leader... I think you'll enjoy it since you have a video about becoming one... You can even play it as Team Sky Gym Leader...
now this is content
No Frogadier?
Ha Ha, It Is I, Gamer Boy!!!
Sceptile has good vegetables 👍🏾
What about Vanilite evolution line? They're literally ice-cream with cones.
This is why I’m pescatarian- Xd
Dude skipped out on Magikarp even though that was the main example from the anime
Im down for a rayquaza roast.  Delicious
9:40 Isn't Pumpkin Spice a blend of Cinnamon and Nutmeg, or am I mis-remembering something?
combee honey!
just pumkin?
What about vanillite the ice cream looking pokemon? Also keep up the awesome work!!!
Can We get a part 2 of this please! 😂
Probably comber’s honey would be good
Hello, I think you know a lot about Pokémon, so could you make a video of what a traditional Alolan Pokémon league would be like? (8 gym leaders, elite four and champion) Thanks for your attention
pumpkin soup? pumpkin gnocchi? excuse me? it's delicious pls try it 😂
Not vanillish and vaniluxe? They are literally ice cream
If you like I can give you money to go on a date with drowsy
Vegans
3:30 from America’s wretched history with driving the Bison to near extinction (and thus driving the Native Americans to near extinction along with the bison) I will strongly refuse.               HOWEVER, I would eat Miltank as well. A good steak dinner with Shuckle juice/wine on the side.
i wonder how shark meat is. I'd like to try a garchomp
Why do I feel like Mikey made this video while he was starving 😂
Vanilluxe
try the pumpkin spice ramen!
The thumbnail makes me feel some sort of pride.
What happened to magikarp
This will sound cruel but I think eevee would taste nice
So Chansey and blissey eggs are like an antidepressant in a way😮
What about swanna
Gogoat would be an amazing source of goat meat. With the leaves that come with it, the mat works probably have earthy and herby notes to eat and that sounds DELICIOUS
Point of order, small fish aren't a problem. White bait is lots of very small fish dipped in flour and deep fried and they're delicious
What about vinilish
Roasted Clefairy might be a good dish, if it doesn’t taste good at least I can sleep well knowing the world is better off.
The ice cream pokemon
Well if we were in Korea we could always just eat and cat and dog Pokemon 90% of the time basically that's what Chinese restaurants are made for
PUMKIN PIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Micheal: if they hunted it that much its gotta be good. me: yeah and i dont like farfechd as a pokemon but i would eat it as a meal.
Hell no on the pumpkin! Quit being a basic white girl
grunty boi grass is not blue it is purple it is so obvious
What about Vanillite? Team Rocket almost ate that one and Appletun in the anime
What about the Vilnalite cone I hear those are insanely delicious
I would just eat the tropius straight up. I think they be good steaks
They are literally just food Vanilish line: am I a joke to you?
Wiglet
a sentian ice cream cone
Vanillite
Lemon grass and mint are both bug repellent and we eat them
Should've had Grunty Boy offer Mikey a Slowpoke Tail
I think Sawsbuck would taste more like shrubs than deer meat and while alcremie can create whipped cream without dying micrey would probably be too sweet and you would have to kill them first.
Weird fun food facts that nobody asked for.  Garlic is a natural bug repellent (primarily with mosquitos) when ingested, similar to the dex entry for petlil. Pumpkin flavored dishes such as pumpkin pie don't actually have pumpkin in them. It's actually butternut squash that is used as the USDA allows anything in the gourd group to be labeled as pumpkin for some reason. Actual pumpkin is actually fairly bitter and unappetizing to most Americans, so the much sweeter butternut squash is used instead. Also, pumpkin spice is just the spices that would be added to the "pumpkin" when making pumpkin pie. There is no actual pumpkin (or squash) used in anything labeled as pumpkin spice.
I feel like Combee would be a tasty treat.
Morals? What are those?
✨I wanna have Shuckle juice ✨
9:56 Mikey....why are there Milk Bones and Fruitables on that table?
331970th
I get that you’ve kept this somewhat realistic but come on wouldn’t you like to try dragon meat, some legendary bird wings or therian forme mystical being stew? Please do another video for the more outlandish possibilities
You forgot the Vanilite line…id eat them ice cream cones
3what about vanilite and his evolutions?
have you not seen the literal pokedex vid withy combusken
As someone who's family raises bison, I appreciate the shoutout to try a burger!
"Shuckel's Juice.. let me expla-"  Sus moment collector and memer: "no, we dont think we need to hear anymore"
Love how he just skims over the “mixing with bodily fluids” part of Shuckle’s dex entry
I love to eat Alcremie and the gigantamax form because I love cakes and I love to eat Appletun because it looks like an apple pie and I love apple pie and I love to eat Tauros because I love burgers. I won't eat the mushroom Pokemon since I hate mushrooms but I would eat pumpkaboo and gourgeist I love pumpkin pie and I love to eat Vanillish and the evolutions I love ice cream and I would eat tangela for spaghetti which I love.
Anyone else here think that edible pokemon will be fairly prevalent in the next meme review? :)
Put some snowcone syrup on a Vanilluxe or Vanillish and I’d imagine that would taste good. And since you brought up Klawf and Lechonk it stands to reason Smolive could be used in cooking using its oil. Then there while it doesn’t seem to have it on the outside I’d think Vespiquen has some honey somewhere in its hive like body
The grass joke is crazy😂
Mikey's (full) break fast. Tropius' banana-Appleton-cherubi fruit pie glazed with bounsweet syrup. Chansey egg with grumpig, paloswine bacon and miltank jerky Pettilil tea with miltank milk and vespiquen-combee honey.  Sweet fruit pie, savory proteins and bitter(balanced) tea. I think that's a good combination.
What about pansages leaf, atleast in the series do it share it to other pokémon as food
I really hope the next ASPITPIAY is loaded with memes of Mikey saying, "But I'd eat his mom." Come on community, MAKE IT HAPPEN!
I think magikarp would be delicious.
3:21 not a sentence i expected to hear ever at all not once in any lifetime
Isn't the vanillite line literally ice cream? What about them?
This was an interesting insight on your personality, I feel like girafarig would taste nice too
Doctors when sombedy has a deep enough wound you can see the bone.can  somebody get a egg in here 1:32
My dad is the same way pumpkin anything especially a dessert is his favorite
Humanity will never be vegans, When a demonic cow exists.
Eat arceus, two words for explaining: ITS GOD
Octilery
Though according to dorkley, combuskin meat equals your death
I would eat ducklett, only had duck meat once but it was very good
Thais is obviously no vegan viewing experience 🙁😅
You forgot about the FRICKING ICECREAM POKEMON
weres magikarp
I’d eat a cloyster…. Just saying.
"Shuckle's Juices" XD
id eat gardevoir
hello
Have Raycon started shipping to countries that AREN’T the USA?
I would definitly eat Slurpuff
4:30 and 4:48 I didn't know Scarlet Johansson was a gamer.
A whole dang ritual for some pumpkin pie… let’s do it
What about miltank’s sausage nipples
Mike, I think you want to eat Combusken because its uh.. oddly phallic.
Thank you, this will be very useful for my "restaurant menu" playthrough I'm planing in violet.
What about tauros it might be relly beffy but i like beffy meat and tailow
Idea for a video : Do a Nuzlocke with every pokemon you hate and see if you have changed feeling about any one of them .
I bet Mikey would also buy Tsareena bath water.
Vegans like me are screwed in the pokémon-world because even plant-pokémon are conscious and more like animals xD
Fun fact: my mom can make pickled pumpkin and it goes well as an extra veggie with the meat based dishes. I recommend to try at least once
I would eat virison for one reason. Made me waste 50 pokeballs for me to catch it. I despise that unovan Legendary
DID MIKEY MAKE A GAMERS DON'T TOUCH GRASS JOKE HAHAHHA
10:10 now I Imagine Mike calling an exorcist or doing It Just to eat a pumkin. The Power of Arceus compells you, now let me eat you
vannillish the unova icecream pokemon might taste good as well. also the tree on torterras back produces edible nuts it enjoys sharing with others
“im not gonna eat bambi. I’ll eat his mum tho” why did this catch me so off guard 😂 oh yeah, also, aussie here, idk if its just ur taste or the preparation but kangaroo steak is extremely delicious! and while i havent had it myself, my family and friends would also recommend emu meat!😊
3:42 haha revenge
3:22 his mom? 😳
2:58 i was bouta say john name to or comment it XD
The Vanilluxe line?
I'd eat the vanilite line I mean it's literally ice cream.
Real talk snorlax would have some tasty real fatty muscle
I think fidough would be very edible too
I'm really hoping someone sends Mikey the tiktok of the chef cooking different pokemon like chikorita bulbasaur and charmander
...anyone clip uhhh... "I'll eat his mom though." ...?
So Ribombi is just Apito but pokemon?
what if eating psychic types had a similar effect to hallucinogens?
You must not care for Chinese food given we didn't see any litten Meowth Persian growlithe or Rattata on the list 😂.
Is it just me who isn’t surprised that this video is 36# trending and only been up for one day
vanilluxe line
Can we talk about how Mikey said that he doesn’t like kangaroo meat, like seriously I live in Australia and i will tell you kangaroo is delicious 🤤
Now we know why farfetchd is so weak and rare. They are hunted to damn near extinction
When u clicked on this video i did in fact not think that i'd agree with Mikey and would not mind to eat, drink some Pokemon
Hear me out, exeggutor would not make a good meal BUT, if you chop it up and used it as wood for a furnace, i think it be good
There’s probably a lot of calories and sugar in Gmax Alcremie but like it’s a giant cake…who wouldn’t want to eat it? At least till I can’t have anymore
Mikey you forgot a lot of fish and shark pokemon
What about Magikarp meat tho? It's pretty much a perfect size for food, so a Magikarp Sashimi, or Fried Magikarp perhaps.
Hows malamar gonna mind control me if its dead? Lelouche would like to know your location.
Hello the ice cream Pokémon? Vinillux?
02:02 "Haha ye, shuckles!"
Did Did he not mention Magikarp?
that chansey one worried me a sec there ok wheres johns comment if its not here alredy someone send him this video unfezant gets sh** on so much anyone else remember the snover berries from the show?
What about the literal ice cream Pokémon?
Uh oh, looks like it’s time for Grunty Boi to touch grass…
I'm surprised there weren't more fish, and he just listed the ones that were explicitly tasty.
Drowzee
Me: sees the video thinks about all the things he could talk about  Also me: ready to watch a video about Miltank
Never mind
Is it just me or did everybody forget about Grante  boy?
Also are do you watch soccer
Grunty Boi Gaming! 4:15
Crookadile If  Alligator tastes like chicken so should crocodile so I bet crookadile's line would be delicious
Because I love Appletun so much, I have to believe that the edible skin is shedded skin.
Wishiwashi
Grungy Boi confirmed wizard.
Mikey: Pokémon that are literally food with faces  Me: laughs in vanilish
vegan teacher about to come after this man
Pure lies adds
You missed the ultimate dessert Vanillish
When I was playing Sword, I REPEATEDLY lost to a Shukle raid.... it's juices would be delicious for more than one reason!
I love this remake of the first video on this,and I love it   Hope your having a great day
Dude roasted piglet is delicious! Tepig would absolutely be a delicious spicy meal
Go touch grass grunty boi
Now grunty boy is a magician 🪄 will he trick Mikey into letting him into team sky?   Find out on the next episode on GruntyBoiZ
I have a Boston accent and the first time you said chowdah sounded right.  Also obviously Miltank is one I'd love to eat. Beef is the only meat I like. Not only that, but I love hamburgers and steak. And I'd try Bounsweet since I have a sweet tooth but also can't taste sweetness that well. Also Sunkern, Cherubi (though I'm allergic to cherries so as long as I'm sure I won't swell up), Exeggcute (seeds taste good), Exeggutor (love coconuts), Snover berries, Appletun, Smoliv oil, Tropius bananas, Vanillish (lactose intolerant but I'd still try it), Alcremie (same as Vanillish, would go good on some Appletun), G-Max Alcremie, Ludicolo (partly inspired by pineapples), Farfetch'd's leek, and Fidough.
your pallet is very diverse
My headcanon is that the pokémon in this video (or any for that matter) wouldn't be safe for consumption for us "normal" humans, because the pokémon themselves are far more powerful- and by extension, dangerous to eat- than normal animals. The humans in the pokémon world probably have adapted to living literally next to monsters that can kill them in an instant, so they developed resistances to the toxins and other hazards present in their food, which we lack.
. Scarlet and violet has a little dog dough Pokemon
I love pumpkin spice cider it is delicious ❤
Lol he forgot gardivoar
Mikey! If you love pumpkin I would try pumpkin mac and cheese with bacon bits mixed in! It is absolutely delicious and my kids eat it without realizing they are eating veggies!
I thought that militant was an eevee!!!😂😂😂
I didn’t even know pumpkin pancakes were a thing
I thought he would say drowzee ngl
Great video, but I feel you are missing the vanellite line. They are basically just ice cream.
Came to comments to see if anyone was making a joke about Mikey saying “I’ll eat his mom though” in regards to Bambi
I'm pretty sure the original slowpoke tail thing in GSC was an allegory for shark fin soup. Interesting then that they retconned it in the Ultra games.
Mikey would you eat pumpkin miltank
"i'll eat his mom though..."  -Michael/MandJTV
I also want to drink Shuckle's, "thick, pulpy juice," in the words of the wise poke-makers, it is "delicious."  (Please note these are jokes, if you check, these are the exact quoted versions of the pokedex entries. Please do not call the FBI)
“Grumpig is the most like a normal pig, just with psychic powers…” Imagine being a pig on a farm… Your a fairly happy animal, loafing around and eating whatever you can and one day you are bacon. Now… imagine being a psychic pig and knowing when and how you will become bacon. I think I’m happier now without psychic pigs. Haha
MIKEY MY PRIMEAPE IS TIMID NATURE AND MY STRENGTH HM IS A TWO HIT KO
I imagine fighting types like Combusken wouldn’t be too keen on the idea of being eaten and are gonna put up a helluva fight
I love pumpkin rolls love and I also love your videos
Hi
i like how he chooses the phycadelix mushrooms
What about combee
Grunty Boi prolly needs to touch some grass
As an Australian, kangaroo meat needs to be prepared quite specifically, the way I tend to describe the taste of good roo meat to those who haven’t had it is, like, pre-marinated
my man want's to eat kfc kanoto fried chicken thank you dorkly.
Ahh, feel like rabbits would make good food choices. Snakes, bears, alligators, Turtles.   Ducklett and swanna. Greninja legs. Sharpedo fin soup. Oricorio. Skwovet and greedent.
If grungy boi is becoming a pro gamer when does he start making more videos
I've watched the old video, and this is a big improvement
Smoliv was missing
uh magacarp thay eat it in pokemon sowrd
Me shows my mom the pumpkin part  My mom: PUMPKINNNNNNNNNN
Fu
Only way to eat Cloyster is to bury your face in it 👅
a fidough cinnamon roll 😮‍💨
I feel like morelull, because of the fairy type, would be more of a magical mushroom if you catch my drift, but hey if you’re into that kind of stuff I guess go for it
I noticed there has HAM in the scarlet and violet camping trailer
Pokémon I would eat:  #1. Ashes pikachu BECAUSE A FRIKING ELECTRIC MOUSE RAT SHOULDNT BE STRONGER THAN A FRIKING GOD
you failed to mention the snowcone pokemon; vanillite, vanillish, and vanilluxe
Hey man I love this video I want another to be totally honest
I would reconsider Lechonk. His name hints at the fact he's something you'd eat. Since Lechon, which is what he's named after is a traditional dish that's main aspect is the roasted pig.
10:18 Why would you not just go out and get a normal pumpkin
.
Becoming a pro gamer has given me powers and intellect beyond your plebeian understanding... What color is grass?
Actually about Barraskewda, real life barracudas can't be eaten if they're above 3 ft in length. I can't remember the exact reason why, but it's something along the lines of the meat being poisonous because of their diet? I don't remember the exact details but I do know it's not safe to eat if they're longer than 3 ft. And Barraskewda is in fact longer than 3 ft
Bring back pokemon talk
I love how Mikey is starting most things like it's awful to kill the Pokemon... but they'd taste great! Lol!
2:00 GAH HA HA! Look everyone Mikey said shuckles juice!
When he said psyduck. Are you sure that’s a duck buddy
"I'll eat his mom, though." - MandJTV 2022
In the poultry department I would add Pidgeot and Pidgey, as the two are just chickens, but one can fly, but Pidgeotto is too much muscle, but who does not like fried chicken, chicken stew, roasted chicken, chicken soup, and grilled chicken
Miltank steak honestly sounds delicious.
wow mikey wants shroooooooms
try Pumpkin Ravioli
that was an interesting video I'd be down to try Braviary...since it's the closest thing we have to a turkey YES I know it's an eagle but...I'M NOT EATING HO-OH! Edit: Also frog legs and aligator meat is good too! so I'd try Politoad, Frogadier and Croconaw. Greninja is TOO lean and Feraligatr is probably really tough. Poliwhirl might be good but not Poliwrath...too tough again.
I don't really know why clicked on this lol but I regret not
Question. Goat-Meat is also eatable. Do you eat... Arceus without the fence?
The vanillite line. I would eat them
He just violated Bambi/ deerling
Vanalit
No icecream?
Grunty Boy is getting stronger by the video, soon he shall become an Avengers level threat.
14:08 I'm glad you've seen the error of your ways
Why not code with gruntyboy instead of mandjtv
5:15
All I gotta say is I have never seen Learning with Ms.Rachel and MandJTV in the same room change my mind
f*cking vanillite
would u eat rabbit meat? like scorbunnys line/ bunneary line?
this video makes me suffer
Vanillite, Vanillish, Vanilluxe would be pretty tasty as well I’d imagine
I enjoyed the video, but as a FC Dallas fan, I’ll like the video after Sunday,
Swirlix is not cotton candy. Just fur
I like alligator meat So I guess I would go for a Feraligator and Krookodile.
Kangaroo meat is incredible if it's super rare, bordering on blue rare.  It's awful overcooked because it's so lean
You coud make Torckic Nuggets 😅
being a vegetarian really helps make pokemon feel slightly less sadistic
I don't want to eat pokemon but I think that vanillite might make good ice cream
Huge character development from wanting to eat crawdaunt to not wanting to eat it
Would you rather have the drowsy or become rich
if you like this video, go listen to the podcast I Chews You, where they talk about how they would eat and prepare every pokemon. so fun!
Fidough?
if there was a shiny gold star rayquaza and deoxys tag team card from 2005 how much do you think it would sell for?
i haven‘t watched through the video yet but if there is no hypno i‘ll be mad, clearly mikey likes to eat certain body parts of it while sleeping with it😂😂
So that’s why farfetch'd are regional exclusive in Pokémon go.
Qwilfish for fugu would be 👌🏻
lol I giggled when I read the title XD I clicked straight away XD
"People do it, so it must be safe"  uh... have you MET the human race?
Boy this is dumb...... Ooooo Pumpkiboo Pie WOULD be tasty
Grunty boi became your average genshin impact player 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Pikachu would make an excellent feast 😈
Silly Grunty Boi, grass isn't blue but close, it's purple 😊
the new dog in scarlet and viiolet
I’d be down for more goofy videos like these
Okay mikey, but about going through mega pokemon and seeing which ones you would or would not eat.
Vids on trending! Congrats bro!🎉
If it’s on fire it’s pre cooked
Sharkpedo
With Raycon, due to playing lots of rhythm games and DS games (and my DS Lite speakers are broken), if they had a wired version or an adapter for non-bluetooth devices, I would get one.
i feel like graploct  would be good for calamari to
Wouldn’t that make your part miltank
I feel like you missed a few that IRL you can only seem to get in specific places. Smoliv, Dodrio, Octilery, Feraligator, Grapploct, Fidough, Krookodile, Shelmet, and Wishcash are the ones that come to mind.
you wouldn’t be able to catch miltank with there speed stats. 😂
lamb choWduuhh
Hiya mike hail yeah
Vanilite??
If I were in charge of pumpkiboos dex line entry, I would put they don't mind people cutting out a few pieces for food because it grows back in time & they like to change around the face carved shape making each pumpkiboo unique & proud to show off different cute or most scary designs. However the spirit inside gets very sad whenever their pumpkin body gets totally smashed & unusable leaving them to wander for a new body as u hear their mournful cries.
Blub
I'm not sure it'd count, but what about Combee's honey?
So, there’s no reason to eat alcreamie because in the anime it’s said to be able to create infinite cream that tastes different depending on its form
More importently, you want milktank to die so they can’t make more milk
Banana
He missed vanilish  vanilite and vaniluxe
There’s an alternate universe out there were Mikey runs a milltank farm. Where he hates milking them but he loves butchering them.😂
I have heard that turtle soup tastes good so im down to eat some squirtle
"I'll eat his mom" -MandJTV 2022.
did grunty boi go to new namek?
Chikorita
The ice cream pokemon, galar tea pokemon
farfetch'd  is like the giant tortoise
After watching this, my son proposed that they should create an "Edible" type for Pokemon.  I'm not sure what a Dark/Edible would be, and I don't think I want to know.
The raycon ad was hilarious! Brilliant job!
“I can’t remember what grass was like. It was blue right?” I don’t know man you tell me!!!!
One Pumpkaboo Pie, and Alcreamie on the side please
I used captions and when grunty boi shows up it says Haha! HSI Grand Tip Boi!
pikachu bc i live in the sewers
Bro favourite food is salmon, I would definitely eat a basculin or a arrakuda
I’ve had alligator before, and it was really tasty, so I’d be down to try a Krokodile
Add Pidgey as a Chicken Pokemon imo, or at least a squab, cool ideas though
mareep and wooloo lives! 🐑
I’d be willing to hire an exorcist if it meant delicious pumpkaboo spiced pancakes
That vegan teacher is absolutely crying right now
the eelectross family are hagfish, you dont want to eat them
"I won't eat Bamby, but I will eat his mom though" made me laughing hard
NOOOOIIIICCEEE 🐱😺🐱😺
Gourgeist is the only kalos pokemon (Megas don't count) that I like. Y u gotta do me like that? 9:43
8:50 Poke PETA
Boi you forgot the icecream pokemon-
Don't we all hate miktank?
Plankton eating Porygon: “Hmmm, holographic meatloaf! My favorite!”
Thank you for not mentioning rabbit meat or rabbit stew! I’m a rabbit momma of many and it upsets me to hear that people eat these beautiful babies so thank you for not doing that!
What about pumpkin spiced pizza
Exeggcute could taste good. They are seeds and people do eat seeds. Since they are bigger seeds you would not need to eat as many of them as you would the normal-sized ones.
Noooo why did you Eat on of my favorite pokemon
good job on trending
lmao
I love the torchick line but honestly fair enough for wanting to eat combuskin. Cuz I love chicken too but that's literally the only chicken line
what about Fidough though !!!!! It's just a food that got  a FACE !!!! 😊😊😊😊
Gyarados is just a bigger version of Magikarp Magikarp is basically salmon
Hear me out hear me out Gyarados
wigglet noodles
Half way thru the legendary battle “.hold on let me eat my Tauros It’s almost my bedtime”
What Abt the rabbits
8:47 i would have thought it was pastry
For vegans, tropius and snowrunt are best to eat
Missin out on the frogs and gators bro they good eatin
The concept of eating pokemon is interesting because pokemon are known to have equal or higher intelligence than humans. Also, I never realized just how many Pokémon had food related entries that didn’t involve them dying
LE CHONK HES A PIG.
I would only eat alcremie
The Bambi joke had me dying😂😂😂
Eat a bootleg and hope it doesn't explode
u missed goomy snails
Vanillite and vanilluxe would be delicious 😋
I'd totally eat a Gigantimax Alcremie
So, so many out of context clips. Too many, even
Nooooo pokemon😢
Just a really late thing about the handbookbstuff so ot said nincada was a psychic type
Michael where the hell did you eat kangaroo meat
Does Galarian Slowpoke have a lemon flavouring since it's yellow?
I'm impressed how he skipped the whole Vaniluxe line, which is litteraly just ice cream
And there is that one episode in the johto that shucle (yes I know I'm not good at spelling T-T) was making juice
6:37 Noo, Unfezant is great ☹️
How could you Unfeazent is my favourite Pokémon other than Sawsbuck
Bulbasaurs bulb has nutriseous juices my friend told me this so don't quote me
I've heard rabbit is pretty good. But considering there's multiple rabbits in the "human like" egg group, i refuse to believe that in the pokemon world there's any overlap between pokemon that ancient people married and pokemon that people eat. Separate that venn diagram as much as possible please.
What about the vanilish line?
Grandpa is in cotton candy it just duets a sweet secretion and that's why it's birds all sticky it's literally just fur you would literally be eating a dog
You forgot vanillish
Octopus in real life even when the tentacles are cooked they move and malamar psychic type so be careful
amongus miltank
That B vitamin joke broke me.  I'm done.
Did I miss it or did he not mention the ice cream pokemon
Mikey should open a restaurant with these names 😂😂😂😂
I would eat Lopu- I mean Garde- I MEAN NOTHING
You forgot the ice cream Trio. Vanillite, Vanillish, & Valnilluxe
"How's Malamar going to control me if it's DEAD!" LMAOOOOOOO WE LOVE U MIKEY
You missed three Pans trio
* Foie gras exists  Psyduck: 👁👄👁
Fun fact: we would not eat so manny miltank as we would eat Taurus.  IN our world we eat more male cows, the female one are used for milk and making more cows.  Bonus fact, the Hide of a male cow gives better leather, cows habe stretchier skin after giving birth and so the leather dosnt realy hold its Thickness. What works well with the meat industrie using more male cows and so producing more male cow Hide/skin.   (yes, i work in a tannerie)
I don't know how to feel about you eating Shellder and Cloyster
I’m tempted to say Vanillish and Vanilluxe, but I’m pretty sure that the “ice cream” part of them is just regular snow.
What about the ice cream cones
My ideal Pokémon diet: Breakfast: Grumpig like Mikey  Lunch: Miltank because it ruined so many of my Johto play throughs  Dinner: Gyrados(RIP to anyone who hunted it in the process of turning it into supper) Dessert: Pumpkaboo. Don’t possess me please
I'm not gonna make a Combusken joke with this one...
what about magikarp
yuck miltank meat
Now I'm hungry
Charizard meat 🔥🔥
Talking of poultry, I'd eat a Doduo.
I would personally eat Meowth, Eelektross, and Pikachu. No I will not elaborate.
I would eat the absolute heck out of febas
I’m surprised he didn’t mention magikarp for seafood there’s literally a scene in the anime where it shows people eating a magikarp
this was a very interesting video to watch as a vegetarian who loves pokemon
Bellibolt absolutely is my number one choice. It looks like candy.
Fun fact, Mikey: Farfetch'd itself is based on a Japanese proverb, something like "don't trust the duck bearing its leek", as like the duck itself was asking to be cooked. It means that you shouldn't trust things looking too convenient to be true :)
I was thinking combee would produce delicious honey, and that would allow for the occupation of beekeeping in the Pokémon world
That multi B vitamin pun really got to me. Hilarious stuff.
metagross.
Did you know that in pokemon insuregence, Mikey(sorry if I mispelled it) predicted klevor with his delta sythers name!!
I would definitely eat fried Pinachu
Vegan Teacher is gonna FLIP!
" I'm not going to eat Bambi. But I'll eat his mom though!" 😂😂😂😂😂
Vannilite?
Pumpkin Pine Needles
why not Lechonk? It derives from "lechon", which is literally roasted pig
"Not Happiny though, it carries a rock." I feel like that shouldn't have made me crack up as well as it did but it made me laugh so much. XD
Where is combee and vespaquins honey?
VANILICE?!
No shoutout to Dookieshed?
Can you watch north of the Border making Pokémon.
What the sentient icecream?
*List of other pokémon not mentioned in this video that could be eaten in the right circumstances:*  - Magikarp/Milotic/Alomomola/Wishiwashi and probably more pokémon that are fish-like (seafood, fish) - Snorlax/Beartic/Ursaluna (meat, fat) - Sharpedo (seafood, shark) - Cacnea/Cacturne/Maractus (cactus juice) - Wailord/Kyogre (seafood, whale) - Walrein (seafood, Walrus) - Regice/Avalugg and probably more Ice types (ice for smoothie) - Vespiquen (honey) - Crustle/Clawitzer (Variations of crab) - Swanna (Swan)  - Bunnelby/Diggersby/Scorbunny/Raboot/Cinderace (Rabbit)  - Skiddo/Gogoat (Goat milk/cheese/ice cream) - Mareep/Flaaffy/Ampharos/Wooloo/Dubwool (Sheep milk/cheese/ice cream) - Volcanion (Hot water for tea)  - Caterpie/Weedle/Blipbug/Grubbin/Scatterbug and more Bug types (Fried bugs)  - Grapploct (Squid)  - Mudsdale/Galarian Rapidash (Horse meat)  If you prefer, you could also get some Frog, Monkey, Cat, Dog, Lion or Fox meat.
No not my best boy slowpoke!
MAGIKARP U MISSED
I think you forgot Fidough
I would eat Remoraid and octillery
You missed the obvious Magikarp. Also I would eat a Bulbasaur. They look like tasty meat cabbages.
Has anyone seen on Google images someone created Pokémon with “food” as a typing? Very creative!
mikey would be the reason milktank would go extinct
Everyone glossing over the Kurzgesagt calendar
Swirlix isn't cotton candy by the way, it's a dog that's sticky and has sugary sweat. So if you wanna eat it that's up to you but it's not just living cotton candy lol
Awesome video ! I think maybe other fish could have been mentioned (Seaking, Mantine as stingrays are eaten...), Octilery for the squid part, but most of all... the Vanilluxe line !
Grunty Boy is becoming too powerful
pokemen rent real
I think you missed the ice cream pokemon. Seems like a no brainer.
5:22 BRUH grunty boy needs to touch all gamers fear... *G R A S S.* also, vanillite and vanniluxe would be great desserts. add some alcremie whipped cream and a cherrim ball (ayo) and then you got a nice cone of deliciousness. Fidough would also make a nice sweet treat, as it is literally a dog made of pasteriez. i should also note that you mentioned tauros as a cow, but never said it was something you would eat. i defidentally think tauros is a nice choice, as wagyu beef is expensive (milktank) its nice to go for tauros some time because you said you would be eating it all the time, and you would prob be broke if you ate it every day.
Vannillish and vanilluxe can be nice ice cream too
I am LITERALLY CURRENTLY EATING and this video is STILL MAKING ME HUNGRY. HUH???
I don't think I could eat a pokemon.
23 hours ago hail Eris
Whiscash would definitely make a really good equivalent to fries catfish
What about the Ice creams?
FROG
How dare you eat mamoswine he’s one of my favorite Pokémon as well as Johns    Also Mikey instead of pumpkaboo just eat a normal pumpkin 🎃 😂😂
Kentucky Fried Combusken
Too bad you can’t eat tentacreul as it’s poisonous
8:46 I think so because I don’t think the sweet skin is actually attached to it
Isn’t meat muscles not fat so pignite and emboar is perfect to eat
Does anyone remember Shuckle's playground rumors?  Many know Shuckle can transform held berries into the Berry Juice item. The rumors say that if you leave that with it long enough, they become Rare Candies
That grunty boi segment was peak. Blue grass had me in stitches
This is interesting but I love your videos
Okay I got the idea for doing menu entry's for these Malamari- A salty rich malamar sunflower oil fried tentacles; it has a special side affect where the emotions of the malamars life you will feel while eating, malamar farms are just as good as 5 star hotels so people feel comfortable and relaxed after the meal
Could you eat Gengar?
Hi
yummy
I’m surprised that you didn’t do Magikarp
The Boston accent was pretty bad. too high pitched and your fast paced speaking doesn’t supplement the accent well.
Ursaring is one I can think of off the top of my head cause you are able to eat bear meat if cooked the right way
HOW DID U FORGET FIDOUGH!!!!!!!
Cherrim
Mentioning not coming up with too much ides for videos I hope Mikey can complete the Pokem Types then vs Now Series soon
how could you miss vanillite you pathetic bidoof
You missed lopunny.. saying this for Cliffe
The honey from vespiqueen and combee
Picture these:   - Grumpig Sausage Hotdogs, with Sawsbuck Venison Chili and Moomoo Cheese.  - Miltank Cheeseburgers with Basculin Chips and a Cherubi Milkshake.
Naaaah i dont Like pigs its haram
Here in Puerto Rico, we eat rabbits, so I would eat Buneary and Bunnelby
Yes grunty boii. Grass is blue
You missed marshadow the marshmallow
How about the ice cream Pokémon?
brutal indeed
Ice cream
Your Boston accent sounds like a Chinese accent
Hey buddy just fyi somebody is photoshopping a cock in your mouth if you leave it wide open in the thumbnail. You idiots should stop doing that
If I'm correct with this you would eat a milktank steak with the side of Slowbro tail Curry with a Gourgeist spice pie with alcreame on top with a cherubi with the side of shuckle juice wine
Mikey: Add some Honey and Milk and I'll drink Petilil tea all day. Me: Oh, so you're àlso taking milk from Miltank and honey from Combee.
Ditto
I would eat moltres
Speaking of not eating lechonk for being small. If there is a bigger piggie(evo of lechonk) I would definitely eat it. It would be fun if the Scarlet and Violet picnic sandwich is made with the real pokemon meat and veggies.
Pumpkin Spagetti Bolognese
well....in the pokemon series the duo has to choose an alcremie to use it's cream to bake a cake and my lord they actually can produce like copius amounts of this cream and with different viscosity's too.
Forgot fighdoh
bro forgot magikarp 💀
You forgot Vanillite
When Mickey talks about eating Pokemon LMAO
I think this man found a new way to fight pokemon,BY COOKING IT
Don't forget about the horse Pokemon I'm not saying I would eat them but people do eat horse some places 😜
Officer it’s this one
vanilite, vanilluxe. i rest my case
Combusken = KFC baby
Vegans exit the chat. Or enter. Depending on how fighty they are.
I'm sorry you would eat bamby's MOM, what do you mean by that 💀
You noticed this video is on trending 👇
No Vanillish line?
Vanilluxe?
I’d eat diglett, just for fun
Your the Dumbest regional Bird or regional Poketuber
my favorite sponsored segment
I would eat vanillish
Kangaroo when prepared incorrectly goes incredibly tough. When it's done right, it's downright delicious and incredibly healthy for you. If you ever come down to Australia, I'd be more than happy to prepare my renowned kangaskhan sizzle steak sandwich for you 😁
Pumpkin is great with meat. Pumpkin cooked with Pork is just fantastic! ☺️
Taste the LIFE
Grass is blue… well done grunty boi
Casually forgot vanilluxe
I would eat a Garadous or its pre evo Magikarp
I hate kangaroo meat too
Personally I'd love me some Buneary or Scorbunny stew
Chinese guy in the pokemon world: "everything is food "
How to say this channel Normal way=em and jei tv(M and J TV) Psycho way=man di jei tv(Man D J TV)
Shuckle HAS THE JUICE
Drowzee is gonna be very upset when it finds out that your against Pokémon x Human marriages
No grunty boi, grass isn't blue... it's pink.
I would like to eat god himself (not bidoof btw because it's the rl god)
Wot
This probably wont be seen but kangaroo meat can actually be really good if prepared correctly,  its a lean meat so searing or similar methods are the best ways to cook it.  Try to cook it for too long and your going to be eating glorified boot leather - signed a dude from a country that eats both the animals on its national emblem.
I would eat Vanilluxe. It's a double scoop ice cream!
TASTY
I would eat lopunny😈
5:20 "although I can't seem to remember what grass is like" is the best grunty boy line ever
God this was the best video ever
Well yes but how exactly would you kill the sentient foods?
He says he hates Miltank, but wants to enjoy Miltank every day because he hates Miltank
Apple tun is a big pie
No poison type. Because you know, can literally poison you
What about combee honey?
As an Australian I agree with you're view on Kangaroo meat. I don't know why it is so popular.
Charizard. Nintendo's already shoving that pokémon down our throats, might as well get a meal out of it.
We should've got an Alohan ghost type, Slowpoke.
I am actually really shocked to know that bounsweet is too sweet for human consumption. Like it is based on the mangosteen, one of the most sour fruits in the world. I have eaten the skin of the fruit and feeling was like eating 10 lemons in one go. And I was told that the pulp was so sour, that if I eat it, I will puke. So it is quite strange that bounsweet is a very sweet pokemon
but would you eat the leaf from pansage's head🤔
"I'm not gonna eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom though." -Michael 2022
Surprise twist, Malamar calamari makes you trip balls.
The icecream cone pokemon!
Oh! Blipbug its so- Look at how crunchy it looks!
6:41😡🗡🗡 is unfezant that bad? i like it tho...
this was the most sussy Micheal video (sorry if I miss type mikeys name)
Pumpkin salmon would be Pumpka-Magikarp :) (there's probably more salmon-like pokemon but I'm a gentwoer so I don't know them or can't think of them :) ).
Don't forget Gigantamax Alcremie, it's literally AN ENORMOUS CAKE. Though you might need about a hundred friends to help you eat it all before it disappears, considering Gigantamax doesn't last that long.
Tropius’ fruit comes to mind!
Given that when harvested ethically Slowpoke don't feel any pain from the removal of their tails, I'd eat Slowpoke tail. Probably most Normal/Flying birds too, since I adore chicken and duck and spent enough time on farms growing up to know how to prepare them. Miltank would be delicious, Tauros would probably be damn tasty too. I wouldn't touch anything with a humanoid form or human-ish face though, that's too much.
Guarantee you that eating a Shiinotic would just make you trip out.
Love the video but damn this was a trip to find during my lunch break.
Did i forget or did you not include applin line or vanilite line?
lopunny
Vanillite! It’s literally ice cream
Grass type Pokémon are just salads 😂
read the combusken dex entry
read the combusken dex entry
“But I dont seem to remember what grass is like… its blue right?” That part got me laughing tho- 😂
combee and bulbasaur bud ?
So no Whishiwashi on your Pizza?
I would eat some "jelly donuts" because they had to get them from Pokemon.
It’s probably the upcoming ham sandwiches and eggs at picnics that brought this on, but I’ve been thinking about this topic since Chuggaaconroy’s Let’s Play of Pikmin 2, when he talked about how Louie catalogues all the monsters in said game. It’s obvious what he’d be thinking if he ever encountered a wild Seaking. 🤤
On the note of farfet’chd (defo spelt that one) dodos taste horrible but we still clapped that for the meat and sport
Miltank milk
This is perfect without context material
Let's hope That Vegan Teacher never finds this video...
What about Mewtwo pie
i like lamb so marep but no evolutions i like tuna and salmon so most small fish like tymo and wishi washi
I think you forgot drowzee
Kyogre is based on the Leviathan, which is supposed to be eaten when the messiah shows up. And I love nigiri. 🍣
Even if pokemon were edible, I would be vegetarian.
9:34 Whould it be a smothie or a slushy?
Is next video every pokemon that you would marry?
can we get another grunty boi play though realy want to see him in johto or unova
gmax alcremieee
I'd be down for some Magcargo escargot.
Wait so u made a eating pokemon video without magikarp????
I would eat vanillite and its evolutions because its just ice cream
You can also eat pufferfish meat (aka Qwilfish). Though I'd be sure you don't wanna even try it
Not vinilite
Do you like soccer or are you just being patriotic
Hearing Pumpkin and meat as a wierd thing is funny because outside of north America pumpkin is savoury
Weezin the Shuckle, buuuuuuddddyyy.....
The moment mikey talked about cows we all knew who was about to be said
Actually a couple of things - frogs (the ones not poisonous) - small fishes can be used to do a bunch of tiny fried fishes (i don't remember the exact name of the dish but they are good and crunchy) - pumpkaboo maybe it's like an hermit crab that sheds his pumpkin every time it gets bigger (since his introductions there was the concept of different sizes) - also don't eat wolves like mons And i guess you could virtually eat the monkeys and snake pokemon
I’ve heard crickets are good so the deleleleloop duo
you forgot to mention magicarp
fidough
This video has informed me of so many more pumpkin flavored items. I thank thee, oh mighty Mikey
3:22 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ok
Togepi
I'd make like shaved ice out of Regice
What does he mean grass isn’t blue it’s red
I just thought of a really fun John Michael Cup video idea! Pokemon Pig (or horse). Basically you take turns going to find and catch Pokémon. The thing that makes it a competition is that you have a limited amount of time, let’s say 10 minutes. If you catch a Pokémon before time runs out, your opponent has to go catch the same Pokémon with at least the same amount of time left. If you don’t catch a Pokémon in 10 minutes there’s no punishment, it’s just your opponent’s turn now. You get however many letters you want, and to prove it you choose either you or your opponent to go do the same pokemon with the same time left. Here’s an example: It’s Mikey’s turn. He goes and catches a Geodude with 7 minutes flat remaining. Now John has to go catch a geodude with at least 7 minutes left. He fails it. Now John has a P. Mikey goes again, so on and so forth. Eventually Mikey catches a Togekiss, John fails it with PI, and chooses Mikey proves it. Mikey fails so John stays at PI, so on and so forth. You can pick whatever game, of course, but I’d say the most fun one to watch would probably be PLA for me personally. Also of course you don’t get to look up locations, and your opponent is not required to tell you the Pokémon’s location. You could choose whatever you want for variants such as alphas, but that may be a bit too tough.
Smolive. What happened with him?
Well I'm terrified
id personally not eat s fruit in which something has been in be it apple or pumpkin. but thats just me probably
I feel you, Grunty Boi. My color vision is slightly off, and when I put on blue light filters, I could suddenly see actual green. It was way greener than whatever yellow-blue bs I was seeing before.
... 6:20... yes but it being fire type... means it can cook itself, said same for when you mentioned Tepig line, that's precooked bacon my dude. I don't think Shinotic would be safe... I think it's a drug shroom personally. You say not execute because it's a seed, not eggs like we continue to think (although... aren't seeds technically just plant eggs, if you think in a broader term, plus seeds are edible, sunflowers... poor sunkern)... but... (looks at Executor the palm tree)... coconut milk anyone?  Some you missed I think would be good would be Wishiwashi, Dhelmise is the seaweed not the anchor, while I don't like seaweed, you like sushi it's a possibility, frog legs so froakie and poliwag lines on the table, turtle soup sorry Squirtle, Gogoat goat meat is edible Quilfish (possibly why Hisuian one doesn't exist, fugu), Vanilite line. Bunnelby, Lopunny, scorbunny any rabbit Pokemon is edible, squirrels like Pachirisu, the chungus squirrel I can't remember the name of, crocodilians, sharks, bear Pokemon, holy crap I can't believe I almost forgot Whiscash CATFISH I LOVE FISH! Maractus, probably not Cacnea line because it Maractus is the type that has drinkable juices.  There's a lot you missed, but this was still fun. Also always interesting to hear and discuss, the 3 things people ask whenever it's something we don't understand, how does it poop, can we eat it... and how does it... do the baby making tango.
What about octillery takoyaki?
I would of eaten arceus
Love the content!  On the subject of bees...  I think combee's Honey would be tasty...  There was a Pokedex entry in "Legends Arceus" about some pokemon stealing combee's Honey..  it must be tasty.  Anyways, keep up the awesome work and have a great day!!!
Maybe it’s just me but I think magikarp and/or feebas are missed opportunities
this is a disgusting video
PM7 when he hears that mikey would eat piloswine.
Not to be rude to pokemen7 or anything but frog legs are a thing and I think there are few frog pokemon that could work
4k
DONT EAT KLAWF, IT IS A ROCK
I’ll eat his mom though 😂😂😂
One work: Magikarp.
This might be the weirdest pokemon video I have seen.
... well... blue grass does exist Grunty Boi, and I'd also say you're not wron in general grass is blue... if you mixed it with the color yellow.
What about combee and vespiquin primarily for honey
Shuckle juice (or actually berry juice) was actually a great thing. In Gold and Silver (don't know if they continued all the way to now, might be worth trying) a Shuckle could be given a berry to hold and if you walked a bit with it in the party you could take berry juice from it. Berries healed 10hp, the juice 20hp. So it was an upgrade for no cost.
Wooooo! I love pumpkin anything too!!
Fine now I’m hungry
Are Seedots edible?
As a cephalopod lover, I take great offence to the Inkay eating         But I don't care about malamar. Malamar can rot.
Dont screw with me Mikey I'll send this to that vegan teacher
Nooo I love crabs
2:36... in the words of Dookieshed... that's bacon that cooks itself. It's also possible to eat wild boar just as much as raised ones, might be a little more gamey, but no reason you can't fix that up, people eat bear meat and it's SUUUPER gamey... deer god (pun intended) Sawsbuck would go extinct from me, I LOOOVE venison, no Stantler 1st because my grudge for them is as much as your grudge for Miltank (though it's also up there for me).  Also Tauros is not a cow, it's a bull... sorry to get technical, but a cow specifically is cattle that has had a calf, you do not eat cows, you eat cattle (the broad term), bull male cattle, heifer female cattle that haven't had children, or... veal but I don't like eating babies, won't judge you if you do. Cows are probably used for making meat, but it's less likely because they'd be used for dairy, while heifers are definitely used for meat. Just providing fun facts for people.
My work sells pumpkin milkshakes you can also make it a pumpkin pie and cheese cake milkshake
"Chansey or Blissey, their eggs specifically"....... I wouldn't not try Chansey or Blissey meat, I mean... you eat duck or chicken eggs they taste good, you eat duck or chicken meat, it tastes good too.
Speaking of delicious pumpkin food, I sometimes have pumpkin lasagna rolls which is one of my favorite meals and is a pumpkin meal
Eating Pansage's leaves will "whisk away weariness" and I remember in the anime, Cilan, Cress and Chili would have their monkeys work together to make tea using the leaves, water from Panpour and heat from pansear.
"people do it, it must be safe"
bro you missed Jynx, Mr. Mime, Throh, Sawk, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Hitmontop
A cursed video idea? YES Very enjoyable and made me hungry? ABSOLUTELY
Love the video. A few ones I'd add: Vespiqueen since they store honey in the bottom of their bodies for Combees.   Also Hisuian Sliggoo looks like it could be prepared like escargot.  Frogadier and Politoed also look like good food. Specially legs. Magikarp, Seaking and Whiscash also look like good fish meat.  And, of course, Celebi's head, which looks like an onion
“I’ll eat his mom tho”🤨
Yeah... Cloyster would be good to eat out!
What about drowzee?
Regarding Parasect, I understand that some cordyceps mushrooms are actually quite healthy to eat.  In fact, its Gen 1 dex entry reminds you of this... while calling out the type of mushroom by name, just in case you missed what incredibly creepy real-life thing this Pokemon is riffing on.
someone apparently watched the dahmer series🫣 lmao
"sausage nipples"
roasted legendary birds
This seems… familiar
I think Fidough would be delicious, but it's too cute I think
For those who don't know, Farfetch'd's Japanese name is a phrase which translates to "a duck comes bearing green onions," which is a Japanese figure of speech meaning "surprising, but convenient."  So its entire original premise was that it's a joke about a duck that carries its own side vegetable.
Im waiting for a true  evil mikey who has milktank and other of his hated pokemon on his team
Tropius and its fruit
You monster
3:23  "i'll eat his mom though". XD XD XD What was mikey thinking while saying this
POKEMON DINER HERE I COME
Vanillish: am I a joke to you?
this is my favorite video youve made hands down. im super biased bc im a huge fan of food related videos especially the discussion of food in media like games but your specific energy and conveying of info has always been one of my absolute favorites out of any youtube content creator. im glad youre back to making more content because ive missed you every day you werent posting
How about grotle berries/nuts they are said to be sweet and very delicious.
oh god damn it now i HAVE to buy raycon
Could we use the rotom forms to cook or store all these Pokémon?🤔
You dont actually need to eat alcremie since it can produce cream and the more happiness it has , the more cream you eat
Omg the sponsor changed for the first time in forever
What about Vanillite and it's evolutions? Anyone for some desert?
mm mmm charazard i bet rosted charazard is delicious
Some of those puns hurt to listen to
I know you said Alcreamie but you forgot about its G Max form which is literally cake
Can vouch for bison, literally my favorite meat. Unfortunately, I've only had it on vacation because I've yet to find a place near me that serves it.
How are Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe not on here?
"So of course I'd have to eat the pumpkin pokemon! Now I know they're ghost type and transport spirits and sing joyfully as they observe the suffering of their prey, minor stuff,.." yeah, like how kidnapping children is normal in the Pokemon universe too
That sabbatical really did wonders. I can sense a different energy with these recent videos. Appreciate all of the work you put out. You and everybody in here, please continue to be safe.
2:37 lechonk would be delicious and healthy it’s pure muscle
A quick note about the "eating bug repellent plants"; there are actually a number of fragrant herbs commonly used in cooking which are known to have repellant effects on some species of bugs. Rosmary, min, and basil are all noted as having some level of effectiveness repelling mosquitoes, for example.
Mikey totally missed the gen 5 ice cream evo line
In kalos you can get slowpoke tail at restaurants in lumiose Edit: THE MILTANK SEGMENT I'M WHEEZING
Ah yes murder just what I’m looking for
Feraligatr would be delicious because I LOVE gator nuggets. Also, sunkern because it is a sunflower seed kernel and I love using them in salads
What about Vanillite and Gellato, hmmm, you forgot them.
You forgot dessert! The Vanilluxe line is literally ice cream
Feraligatr (really like crocodile meat, assume gator taste about same) Octillery, you talk about calamaris, but i prefer octopus tentacles real life. You mentioned unpheasant, i enjoyed pheasant in real life  but also pidgeon so serve me the pre evolutions yum. Buneary, rabbit is delicious. (The soccer rabbit looks to human and the xy gen is  dirt type so nah) Wailmer, must be populair in japan. Sharpedo: fin soup. Raticate: rats get eaten  just no dirty sewer or city variants. Ponyta, zebstrike i enjoyed both zebra and horse meat real life. Gyarados, imagine big chunks of flesh. Also would just go for dragonite meat
"I'll eat his mum tho" hahaha
How come Drowzee isn’t on the list?😅
Why not Magikarp?
I'm sure some people including a purple YouTuber would eat gardevoir or a certain bunny
Squirtle Soup could be nice.     Torchicken Nuggets Jigglypuff I think would be somewhere between Marshmallow and meat, which I can get behind. Torkoal soup would be like turtle soup, but I imagine quite spicy. not a spice fan myself, but some might be. Vannilite. literal ice cream pokemon.
I’ll wait for a chef to make all these Pokémon and cook Mikey a meal
5:46 Me: *sighs Also me: *searches of the meme template for it
💮💗🌟🌠💙👙🎄✨🌠✈💮✈🎋💮✈💮👙💙💙🌙👙       *God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.* *He also promised to heal your body.* *If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead* *He'll give you eternal life* *(Look up at the sky and ask God)*
Miltank is good for you eat it as much as you can kill it
As a vegetarian this video was.....very awkward
No one should eat any food based Pokémon.   Slurpuff and Swirlix are said to be sticky. They live in the wild. That cotton candy fur can’t be washed easily and it probably would have dirt and leaves around it.   Vanilite and It’s evolutions are not ice cream.   The fanbase would destroy you for even thinking of eating a fidough.   Alcremie, meh, I mean, It can autogenerate the cream, but Idk.    Pumpkaboo is fully inedible. It was just a pumpkin at one point. Not anymore. You missed your chance.   Applin is more worm than it is apple, it only fuses with the apple after evolution.
Yes grunty boy grass is blue 😂
I mean... Yeah Snover's berries would be a nice treat... If it weren't for Abomasnow. Because if it catches you taking berries from it's baby then you're pretty much a goner. RIP in pieces ig.
Im suprised you didn't say any frog related ones like: froakie frogadier  greninja politioed ect or snails like slliggo tho these are both very french dishes
Mandjtv talks about pm7  Me time to look at the comment s
definitely would eat miltank and make some fire ass tacos
I will eat a female Gardevoir on that               .               Down side
"I'll eat his mom though"
No Fidough?
Kid eats appletun back skin,  Appletun gets tired of kid Appletun used dragon pulse
Michael  for the john Michael cup
I will eat magic cop it’s so weak. We just need to get rid of it and I think it’s states and one if it’s poker dic es that it is tasty. Not sure though only problem is the scales would need to be removed. I remember the episode will meow with it into one and focus teeth
Great video, you might've missed the vanillish line
Someone please make the the quote  "I'll eat his mom though
Me: 😢😢😢 MandJtv: I will eat this Pokémon and that Me: I think I want to be vegetarian  MandJtv: there are a lot of fruit pokemon   P.S watching this video make me feel so bad LOL😂😂😂
In Masters, Siebold actually says that his Clawitzer was to be used as a cooking ingredient.
mikey killing off pumpkaboo for products that don't have pumpkin in them, everything pumpkin spice flavored doesn't have pumpkin and pumpkin pie ain't worth those guys haunting my lawn
I’d eat everything under the condition that I can use Alakazams spoon
make this comment's replies look like the search history of new gamer grunty boi
Something something Brian David Gilbert
grass is blue now grunty boi says that it's blue so it's blue
I think I'm gonna need more of this type of content
DONT EAT THE QUACK
Im porbably the only one who’s into Pokémon and soccer that I know. I hope Austin FC takes the win in tomorrow’s playoff game!
Aussie here, Kangaroo is a great meat when cooked properly, which is hard to do. It's so juicy and tender
throughout this video i have been trying to catch a chansey in pearl, wish me luck, ive already used a greatball, 3 premier balls, and countless pokeballs and only have 23 left  update; i caught it with 4 balls left, garfeild my psyduck came in clutch, and i named the chancy suffering
oh no I hate eating eggs good bye all the blissey /chancey egg benefits
"Can't remember what grass looks like" - said while standing next to a tree
Mikey: No matter how puggy it is, the whole is gonna be waygu beef. Nick Giovanni: Did someone say waygu beef?
miltank sucks so much it's better off as a burger.
Not a pokemon, but I would eat Cynthia
Considering you brought up that byproducts of pokemon count, I'm surprised you didn't bring up Combee and Vespiquen's honey! According to its diamond pokedex entry, it's sweet and has a floral taste. It would be a perfect topping for some Pumpkaboo Pancakes!
You eat Crawfish tails though………you should know this, you’re from the south(ish)…….
Would eating grass types still be vegetarian?
Why do I feel like Mikey and Lockstin teamed up to release two almost "trolling" sounding videos around the same time. This video's comedy and the Lockstin "Pokemon Name" video got me lmao. 😂
13:55 the anime also shows they are very sweet and delicious  (That one episode in sun and moon with young mallow and lana)
could go for some clam chaodah right now
Repost ?
Mikey going for a ThatVeganTeacher reaction fr
If some one is Chinese they would eat golbat
Wouldn’t conbuskin Be Like KFC😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
All the vegetarians and vegans in this video 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I bet Qwilfish and Overqwil served as sashimi would be magnificent delicacy (if its poisonous spikes are removed well)
Mikey may be a living in the state of Texas, but he has clearly never been east to Louisiana. Fried Feraligatr tail, with some Politoad legs on the side sounds good to me.
I thought pillowswine was a type of mammoth but now I'm starting to realize there probably pig mammoths Edit: you completely forgot about magicarp it is literally a carp
Sharpedo Fin Soup. Just saying
Mikey you Skipped the Ice cream pokemon
do to the almost human like intelligence that many pokemon display, i have personally decided that most meat is simply tofu, and that the tofu industry is highly developed in the pokemon world
Combee would be a good pokemon to eat since it's just honey in a bee's body
Missed the Vanniluxe line
I'm kind of spooked how many pokedex entrees are them tasting the pokemon. It's like they got hungry while watching and just hunted it
I love his reason for eating farfetch’d if its hunted that much it must be good 😅😂
" haha it is I grunty boy " Cc: HAHA HSI GRAND TIP BOY
fry a lovedisc and turn it into a chip
Haha grunty boy needs to touch grass
Funny how ducklett and psyduck were said to be too small but are definitely bigger than real world ducks and I think bigger than farfetchd
I wonder what shiny Pokémon taste like
The shuckel juice just sounds like he's making illegal moonshine and in hiding
Magicarp?
I’m surprised you didn’t say vanilluxe an it’s line
I would eat pikachu
You
Missed fidough
The rabbit pokemon
what about vaniluxe
Talking about Petilil's leaves being used as tea and bug repellent made me think of Yarrow. Yarrow makes good tea and it's used as bug repellent too.
I’m sorry to have to ruin this for you Mikey but “pumpkin spice” and “pumpkin flavored” item actually have nothing to do with pumpkins at all. It’s a blend of different spices with a long backstory as to why it’s called “pumpkin spice” but none of them actually contain any pumpkin nor do pumpkins taste anything like these sweet treats.
I would like barrcuda sushi!
An episode where miky is Evil and dark
Politoad... GET DEM FROG LEGS!!!
Bad idea watching this on an empty stomach
I'm gonna chew a sunkern and fulfill my dream of being Hamtaro
Gardevoir
can tell you roo meat isnt very nice (coming from an aussie)
Just milk milktank dry and eat it
Reason why you should eat torchic: chikn nuggets 6:13
3:23 You dog, you! HAHAHAHA!
nice and super
I would eat the new engine pokemon
I wonder how arcoos would taste? Probably godly 😂
You could eat bug Pokémon. I’d try eating bugs if cooked by a chef. I was wondering as well. Would you be able to cook fire type Pokémon when fire doesn’t burn them?
Pumpkin hot sauce
Pumpkin hot chocolate
Here me out fried charizard tail
Mikey: Greetings Pokefans! Auto subtitles: gory teams for events! O_O oh no
but seriously. Game Freak should introduce more chicken pokemon
I broke my shoulder bone
you mean it's top tea-r
We got introduced to Fidough, and that sounds like it'd be a pretty good choice to combine with Alcremie to make lots of sweet bread desserts.  Also, the honey from various bee Pokemon.  And fish. Lots of fish Pokemon!
i think Bulbasaur's Bulb on it back was stated to be highly nutritious so I'm willing to try it.
See, I would want to eat Crabominable just because I hate it so much.
Great video overall. Love the concept of food and pokemon intersecting in a playfully moral grey area.  4/10 on the Boston  accent though. Thank you and your team for the hard work put into these videos.
What about Fidough?
Vanillish?
We will not eat duskull I have him in my arms!
Fried decidueye and greninja legs
has team sky conquered Pixelmon yet?
you forgot turtle 🐢. I wouldn't, but I know some that do
Slowpoke tail would probably taste like a fusion of pork and shrimp judging from the way it looks.
vaniluxe
you forgot magikarp
3:22 AYOOO?!?!?!?!
Hello
the Ice Cream Pokemon
I for one dont find it wierd at all that people eat pokemon, even with the talk about pokemon partnership and friendship. for example many people have dogs as pets but in asia they eat dogs so take that how you will
was making a whip cream cake, but someone decided to hide a revive in there and now it's an alcremie and won't give back the whisk.
In the seafood department, I feel like Octillery and Seaking are notable omissions. I specifically mention Seaking and not Goldeen because while Goldeen seems to strictly be based on a goldfish, Seaking is not only larger, but also seems to take some inspiration from salmon. Also, its Sword Pokédex entry mentions it becoming more fatty in autumn during mating season.
7:10 Aussie here. Kangaroo meat is meant to be quite chewy. Goes well as a substitute for steak on a steak sandwich.
No frog meat ? I guess you don't want to offend PM7 that much.
Isn't Magicarp also edible sea food?   =^~^=
I'm a vegetarian so I guess I wouldn't eat any pokémon, not even the fruit ones BUT IF I WEREN'T I would totally be on board with you, they do sound yummy haha
You forgot the gen 5 ice cream cones
You forgot Garivoir uwu 😈
“If they say it’s delicious then it’s gotta be”😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kyogre sushi served by Groudon .
Never had it my self but I herd crocodile and alligator meat is good  so maybe the middle evaluation of the unova sand crocodile pokemon   Sorry I can never remember the name
Homie u gotta eat deerling the fawns are tastier than the adult deer
How about goh’s giant magikarp turned to sashimi?
Vanilite would be yummy
Best Grunty Boi segment yet.
I've used pumpkin in place of chopped potatoes in some recipes during the fall in meat stew and pot pie.  I thought it tasted good.
Sorry pm7 didn't unsup to m&j tv
Pokémon married people?  So you and drowzee can have a loving life together
”ill eat his mom tho” LOL
how about the turtle pokemon? squirtle line and such. turtle soup ain't half bad.
hmm how about fidough? isnt it just bread? and the icecream pokemon. apparently they taste good.  then if you're cajun or like cajun things.. theres the gator/crock pokemon.
Ah you should really give some good lamb a try, it's very popular in a lot of countries and I would say, it's the best red meat, a lot healthier than beef
Galarian Zapdos Qwilfish Ho-Oh Whiscash Relicanth Gastrodon Lumineon Stunfisk Grapploct Calyrex
no love for the vanillite line, sad
Milk a Miltank right before killing it! Now you have both the meat and the milk AND no Miltank was left alive! it's a win win win
Pumpkin fries 😊
I feel like the community could get a lot of good memes from this video
Don’t we literally eat Slow poke tails in Sword and shield when we make that specific curry? Also I wish PM7 would do a reaction to this video!!!
Drowzee might get jealous if it hears you are drinking Shuckle's juices ;)
Best part you don't have to kill petaill
Pokemon smash or pass? I only know of eat or yeet.
Yes bison is amazing
2:55 if it’s too small, eat 2. I think people in Paldea eat Lechonk as bacon
Why does nobody remember pumpkin cookies. 😢
Funfact in heartgold and soulsilver (I'm not sure if it's in other games after too) Shuckles actually hold berry juice in the wild
ok wait, am I understanding this correctly? So shuckle is basically a lump with knobs, AND it has the juice?
i. would. eat. them. all.
How about the ice cream pokemon?? Vanellish, vanellite vanilluxe?
Put the honey from that's a Quinn
My phone skipped from the slow poke segment where he was talkinga bout team rocket to the end of the sponsorship at Mike's last line so I was so confused 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Is it November 18 yet?
For some reson when you said it makes jucies inside of it's body I thaught of a blender just in his shell.
What about the vanilite line?
What about vannilux?!
Interesting that drowzee got left off this list...
We should eat Wartortle. Never had turtle, but would like to try it.
I'm glad he didn't mention dragon meat, that's not for us peasants
pokemon team hates lobster meat pass it on
Oh, this is a good video. Mikey seems genuinely happy in this one, and the happiness is contagious. Also, Grunty Boi now has literal magic powers.
In the Pokémon world, or as in the Pokémon anime my Mouth is Watering!
2:25 If your eating shuckle juice you better not let Drowsy catch you!
Pumpkin moose
A gorebyss unagi role might taste good
Vanilite
as a filipino,lechonk will always be my first choice.        for food…
I'm sure Pidgeotto could be a really good meal.
3:23         *That's what he said*
Ummm... hear me out, I'd think that squirtle would taste good
Leave eelektross out of this!
I heard the drowzee meat is delicious :))))
I mean I actually like lamb, so Wooloo wouldn't be off the menu for me.  Skiddo either for that matter.  Since you mentioned things like Chansey's egg, I'm surprised you didn't say some Combee honey. I think that would be interesting.  Bunnelby and maybe Buneary because rabbit is actually pretty good as well.  That's just off the top of my head anyways.
Bayleef's leaf/tree shoots growing in the tubular leaves around its neck. (I didn't realize that that was what those were until I looked at its ORAS dex entry). Whole bay leaves are common seasonings in soups, even if you're not supposed to eat them, but they can be ground down for use as a spice and eaten safely (the idea that bay leaves shouldn't be eaten has to do with the stem catching in your throat).
Now I know what to use in my sandwiches in scarlet and violet
3:23 AYO!
Pumpkin bananahhnaaa
I will also eat miltank everyday.
Imagine leveling up in the wild, fighting your HEART out, almost dying..! And then some silly bug catcher comes and eats you.
Please do not eat me
Peta just wants to talk
Vanilla and Vanillux?
"I'll eat his mom though."
3:33 Make sure the Bison burger from said restaurant is actually real bison meat first.
Gardevoir my guy me and purplecliffe with eat gardevoir 😉😏
Vanillite line
id hate to do this bc its my favorite pokemon and im aware the food is illegal but anyone from the garchomp line would make some pretty baller shark fin soup
"i'll eat his mom tho" got me dying
Fidough,  magikarp?
Galarians use Marowak's bones to season curry. I also read Skiddo and Gogoat provide milk too. And, according to Pokémon Café Remix, Lilligant's flower is just as good as Petilil's leaves to brew tea.  EDIT: People use Octillery ink as a cooking ingredient, too.
Lechonk is named after Lechon a dish in Spain of a smoked pig 😂😂 I love Lechonk but it makes him sound so tasty.
what about fidoughs ears
I heard shuckle’s juice and immediately my face went 🤨 which just shows how immature I am-
How did you mis the Vanillite line? It's living ice cream. Sounds like a win in my book
Exquisite 2am viewing
Bidoof… CONSUME!!!!
Grunty boy sacrificed everything for gamer powers
what about vanillite, the icecream-mon
Hey Mikey u forgot the ice cream pokemon
*9/ Ponyta and Rapidash and probably Mudbray. Mudsdale is probably on the tough side. Horse is one of many controversial meats. Marill, Azumarill, and Buneary. Scorbunny in my opinion would probably have a spicy flavor. I have not tried rabbit before. Frog pokemon like Poilitoad, Greninja and Venasour. The vanilish line has a sweet snow coating on them. Some people eat cat, dog guinea pig, snakes and lizard. I have had Iguana in the past and wasn't a fan. Im not opposed to trying guinea pig. Sharpedo fin is always an option. If you have ever had imitation crab meat, then you most likely have already tried shark. Octilary might be pleasant. Bug pokemon like Grubin and Kricketot have IRL counterparts that are eaten in many places. Some of what I have listed depending on where you live is perfectly normal or even considered delicacies. It's all about perspective, where you're from and what you have available to you.
We're exorcising some pumpkins over here 🤣
no grass is purple
HOW DARE YOU DISLIKE KANGAROO THAT IS AN ACT OF WAR TOWARDS US AUSSIES
Mikey supports Miltank Genocide. 👍
Australian here: Kangaroo is really tough and rangy. You get best results with stewing or mincing it.
I wonder if Torchic nuggets would be naturally spicy     Also Grunty Boy is wrong, I’m pretty sure grass in magenta
Just a suggestion: perhaps whale meat?
What about sharpedo fin soup?
Hi
😂😂😂
Vegans watching 👿👿 😂😂😂
PLEASE CLIP THE "I'll eat his mom tho"
Vanillish?
Milktank will be extinct because of mikey
3:20 is this a ur mom joke?
PETA wants to: know your location
“I’ll eat his mom though” 😂😂
Two things. First, Swirlix is not cotton candy, it's a puffball with sweet bodily oils because it only eats sweets. It just has sweet tasting fur if you were to lick it. Second, if using any cooking ingredient from a Pokémon counts as eating it, Fidough's yeast-breath is already said to be useful in cooking.
Pumkin Drowsee
Grunty Boi: I'm feeling cracked at fortnite my guy
Really awesome video Micheal, honestly was very enjoyable, but how could you miss Octillery or Grappoloct? I personally love cooked octopus, raw is pretty good, but not better than cooked, but I’m curious what would you think about it? Thanks!
I love shrimp so I've always wanted to eat an anomalocarissince it was an ancient two foot long shrimp. I'd want to eat an anorith. Oh also Clauncher and Clawitzer.
Executor 3 heads are considered to be coconuts!
Sorry Mikey but if a seance is the only way to purify a pumpkaboo and eat it, there should be no way any pumpkin based product can be mass produced.
Maybe it's the pink, but I think that slowpoke tail would be slightly sweet, somewhat like seafood
is there something in Magikarp dex enteries about it not having enough meet if not i'm suprised that he didn't mention it unless i missed it
Kangaroo meat is really good if prepared well. Unfortunately that's easier said than done
And this is the story of how Mikey became my second favorite YouTuber after Noble
Combees honey.. gator tail from crocnaw or ferligator.  Oddish could be cooked since it resembles an onion.
An omelette made from Chansey or Blissey eggs sounds delicious! And with good benefits!
If he ate miltank and liked it would that mean he likes miltank?
I love that this is just a complete updated version of Mikey's of top 10 pokemon he'd eat. Also if you didn't know Krabby's Japanese name is just Crab so it's pretty much just a one to one
uh oh, here comes that vegan teacher...
Bro I'm almost certain eating a Shiinotic will get you trippin off that fairy dust. That said I'd eat.
Congrats on trending.
Mikey laughing at his own pun is peak content.
This video is baconic
I feel like I’m gonna start to use the phrase: “Playfully Morally Grey”
"Every Pokemon I would Marry" when????  DROWSEE WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST ONE ON MIKEY'S LIST
Pumpkin scones
i would eat combee its just honeycomb with wings
Gardevoir looks delicious tho?
HOW JUST HOW. I GOT AN AD FOR RACON BEFORE THE VID
"Im not gonna eat bambi. ill eat his mom though" Mikey-2022
9:20 this aslo work with gymgirls.i heard that from friend
Not that I'd volunteer myself to eat any bug-type pokemon, but there are a lot of edible bugs irl. I've heard that Spiders and Scorpions taste like Crab, while things like ants, crickets, and mealworms generally have earthy/nutty flavors. And since bugs are often pretty low on the food chain, they tend to be very abundant and replenish their populations very efficiently.  So we could probably build out a pretty large list of potentially edible bug-type pokemon, avoiding anything potentially toxic (poison type), or overly dangerous (who's gonna put their neck on the line to taste what a Scizor's claw meat tastes like?).  Caterpie, Wurmple, Kricketot, Grubbin, Blipbug, Surskit, Yanmega, Dwebble, Wimpod, Dewpider, and Araquanid would be by picks for potentially edible bug-types. They're on the small side, but what bugs lack in size, they unfortunately make up for in sheer quantity,
Bro pal world is looking sick, I can’t wait to eat the Pokémon
Mikey, I know it sounds insane, but hear me out. You should use miltank on your next play through where it’s available. I have a feeling this might mend your relationship with the understandably off putting Pokémon. If the Pokémon is a valuable asset, you might become emotionally attached to it, therefore mending your relationship with the Pokémon.
Can't believe Mikey would eat my man combusken
kLaWf SaNdWicH YuMmM WITH SOME shinoticc mushrooms YUMMY
So I wonder if Mikey was hungry or just REALLY bored when writing this script lol
He forgot to talk about Gardevior
Miltank would be yummy
Are you hitting on Combusken? How could you, Mikey?! Think about what Drowzee would say!
It's not too weird for a natural bug repellent to be edible. Ants are repelled by peppermint and lemongrass.
What about the vanilish line
"I like to eat" idk pretty weird
Grunty Bois pronunciation of plebeian gave me Stoneman Syndrome.
The vegan teacher watching this be like
Mikey saw those videos of the starters getting cooked (look it up) and got inspired.
Fillet of Magikarp is supposed to be good...
The floppy sausage nipples!!!!!!!!!!!
Not watching yet. But dope. Good idea.
it would be Clam Chowdah not Clam ChowDAH, you focused to much on the dah part. For the Boston accent essentially just drop the R so Clam Chowder becomes Clam Chowdah, or Car becomes Cah. Source, I'm from New England. here's a way to remember it, everywhere else in the US, if you lost your Khakis it means you lost your pants, In Boston if you lost your Khakis (Cah keys) then you can't get into your car.
“Although, I can’t really remember what grass is like.. it’s blue right?” I know I have the power to say it.. but I don’t know if I should
You did this yesterday? Fine
Vanillite
I would eat lopunny
Well some places they eat bear meat so maybe ursaring and ursaluna since they're bears
"I'll eat his mom though." The amount of clips that got made from that one moment...the next ASPITPIAY is going to be littered with these jokes, I feel like 😅
Chickorita , onion
A friend once gave me some bear jerky to try and it was good, so I'd probably eat Beartic or Ursaring. I've also tried Emu meat so Doduo and Dodrio would probably be good too.
You should eat a Vanillite on an Appleton.
Miltank burgers.  Delicious. Time for a PokéBBQ.
As an Australian I'll tell you if you want to cook kangaroo, you have to cook it slow and low
kangerroo is bussen
Miltank after absolutely demolishing kid Mikey: GG EZ GET REKT NOOB. Mikey:Say that when your dead and inside my stomach 😃
Thank you Mikey! I really want to try slowpoke tail too 😂 You really need to do more colabs with gruntie boi I feel like Machop, machoke and Machamp could be good
Some people eat rabbits, Pikachu (I know it’s not a rabbit but I always thought it was!)
What about some octopus? Like octillery or grapploct Where I live it's very common to eat octopus tentacles and they are really tasty when combined with some boiled potatos
Does that mean that Mike likes to eat combustcan the BALLS
honestly your funniest video yet, absolutely hilarious!
Almost all birds that can be domesticated and farmed are considered poultry. So yes, Unfezant would be poultry irl.
Hear me out on this one I don't really like spicy stuff Enderman great person that probably try a lot of stuff as long as it wouldn't kill me but Politoed legs simmered in melting milk and in some water down bond sweet sweat it just sounds delicious.
So we're not touching Fidough.
Guide to pal world survival
I think Octillary would be delicious
Forgot Vanilluxe
But what about miltanks sausage nipples?
Combees honey, the three ice cream Pokemon, Magikarp can go with the fish too or Goldeen and Seaking maybe. Octillary if your adventurous to try octopus, it's actually pretty good.
"I wouldn't eat Bambi But I would eat it's mom"                                -Mikey
Hungry? Chansey egg Hangry? Chansey egg Feeling angry? Chansey egg Feeling sad? Chansey egg Full? Chansey egg Mean? Chansey egg Sick? Chansey egg Eating dissorder? Chansey egg Bored? Chansey egg Stressed? Chansey egg Procrastinating? Chansey egg Boom.
Let me just casually exorcise this pumpkin to make pie.
7:40 onion and garlic are supposed to be an natural mosquito repellent ;)
Pumpkin Supremacy! 🎃 🎃 🎃
#20 on trending. Well done!
WHOOOOOOO REVAMP!!!
For the squids I’m surprised he didn’t say Tentacool and Tentacruel, and for fruits and veggies what about Seedot
Do a play through of Coromon
Stay with me on this one, Scizor. I'd eat a Scizor
you don't want to eat miltank.   dairy cows are not really very good for that. you can make male dairy cows into hamburger but that's about it.
9:28 That Dex Entry is familiar, which can only mean it was in one of Mikey's videos, or John's.
But where is the dough dog (forgot the name but from scarlett and violet)
Would you eat a female Drowzee?
You’re cute tbh
7:40 Does Mikey know that caffeine is an Insecticide?
This is the most texas food review I've seen in a minute 😆 "idk if it's edible but I'm willing to try"
Pls no more jokes there trash
Pokémon and PETA made me Vegan. Get me the Grass Types and an endless Razor Leave Salad.
Why does Mikey want to eat bambi's mom, out of Context that sounds weird
No ice cream pokemon?
Grunty Boi is literally a true gamer in this video😂
I mean pretty much all fish pokemon would be ok. But you showed a picture of cooke Magikarp and didn't put it on the list
Gruntyyyyyyy boiiiiii
Hear me out I think farigiraf would taste good (possibly girafarig)
I've had pumpkin and beef tacos. They're amazing. Pumpkin flesh pairs really well with savory things
Wishiwashi is a clear one you missed as the dex states it’s only use is to be eaten
From memory you only missed the vanilluxe line and fidough.
What about vaniluxe
Mikey thats ash's Krabby not Gary's gary doesnt have a krabby cannonically
I don’t eat red meat a lot, but I’d happily try Miltank steak or burger.
today, i have sinned, i skipped the grunty boi part of the video
"I'll eat his Mom, though." —MandJTV
You miss magikarp lol
Even tho I absolutely love this pokemon, Pyukumuku would absolutely be a part of the seafood portion of the list. It is known as the sea cucumber pokemon and it is said sea cucumbers have many nutrients. Although, you'd need to make sure it does not have slime on it, said to be used for curing sunburns.
If you like venison I would be willing to send you some I do jerky, burger, and steaks
i would eat miltank too.... As Whitney watches.
Well i'm a fan of steak, so hey tons of meat.  And also I just gotta say this here was a delightful yet funny video, where it makes me want to include this in my pokemon story
You missed Sharpedo although it has rough skin.. Shark meat is actually pretty good and sweet! You gotta give it a try Mikey!!
I can see you are wearing an Austin FC tee shirt that’s my favorite team Lol.
I’m sure it’s just Appletun pastry because it’s a PIE so it’s probably fine as long as it still has some pastry left over
After he talked about bounsweet’s sweat an old spice add showed up
Am I weird for wanting to eat a gallade?
Great video. PS Mike if you drink The Pink cow milk you might turn into one according to the pokedex.
I heard that there's gonna be a sushi dragon in pokemon Scarlet an Violet, so that will be number 1 on the top ten pokemon i would eat. P.S the leaker has been very accurate on what we got of these games so why doubt them on the sushi dragon?
If I'm gonna get offered Bounsweet sweat, I'd refuse and drink Tsareena's instead
What about octopus 🐙
Galarian farfetch’d and sirfrtch’d would have a lot more duck meat on them then farfetch’d and they aren’t endangered so everyone wins
this entire video has to be one of the funnier ones he's uploaded
10 times better than the original
Gardevoir 😏
Grunty boy  starts playing Skyrim and joins the Thievesguild
Yes, Mikey.. As an east coaster, your Boston accent is acceptable. 7/10, little more emphasis and less nervousness, and you'd do perfect! (´º∀º｀)
How many types of pumpkin do you have? Where I am in Australia we mash pumpkin together with potatoes and sometimes chopped up sausages… what is this candy pumpkins you speak off???
ever tried eating turtle? I hear its pretty good
Vaporeon
fidough
“Wow, those look great. I need to get a pair for pc or controller at home.”  Me: 🤔🤔🤔🤔
No grunty boi is. Grass is purple i think Also if you don't like kangaroo meat it probably wasnt prepared well because well I live in Australia and I have enjoyed kangaroo a lot of times at resturants but it definitely has something to do with how it was prepared because kangaroo is described to have a kinda of cow like flavour so idk.
My husband made a team of all food-based pokemon. And... one Alakazam.
I would eat godfish (arcoos)
charzand could be good cuz i know some people eat lizard and it would be preaty hot so it would be preaty cooked already and i like lizard so i would eat it but not cahrmander like you said smoll
Does this mean grunty boi doesn't play pokemon as all games have grass
Mmm yum,I would love a miltank taco, especially Whitney’s miltank
Pokemon but I only use pokemon i would eat when?  Edit: interesting that Mikey WANTS to the small head of the 420 pokemon
Looking for vegan comments
what about fidoug?!?!?!
Barracuda are actually poisonous so I wouldn’t eat that.
fidough
Breed Farfetch'd. Then they won't be more extinct when you eat them.
I enjoy honey so I would like to eat Combee and Vespiquen's honey. Not beedrill though, I think they would kill me if I tried.
“I would not eat blaziken, as it’s too human, and on Fire!” Talk about your roasted Chicken…
Just think about it........to drink cow milk, you have to kill the baby (or take it away  from the  mommy) so to drink miltanks milk........
What about occtilery
Kangaroo meat is a slightly tastier version of beef so you had it wrong
So... Whos gonna be the first to give a lechonk a ham sandwich....
Lol
Lol definitely love this video and seems like you had fun with it too. Made me hungry!!!!
I think you forgot Drowzee 😉
Did he forget the literal ice cream Pokémon in the Vanillite line?
I was dying of laughter during the pumkaboo part
No vanilite, vanilux etc?
When he started talking about doing a ritual to take the spirits out of the pumpkaboos body i started imagining a circle of people with a black cloak some kind of cymbol in the middle,with a bunch of litwicks surrouding the cymbol,and 2 lampents and 1 chandelure floating above all of them,and then the ritual would start and the litwicks,lampents and the chandelure would start to absorb the spirits in the pumpkaboos body.
pumpkin soup Pumpkin Soup PUMPKIN SOUP.
Magikarp
Throw a couple Fidough in an oven at 400 for 25 mins. 😄
for meat and pumpkins. i made a pumpkin soup with hokkaidos and some smoked sausages, potatos, broth ... was delicious
What the acutual F is this title lol
You missed torchic you can eat them like chicken nuggets
"I will not eat Bamby. I'll eat his mom though."  Me: *Almost chokes on my breakfast.*
I wonder how the bugs would taste? I haven't tried eating bugs IRL, but I imagine that if anything, Bug Pokemon would be tastier.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You missed one the worst legendary kyurem it would taste good and would be ice cold
Pretty sure Morelull and Shiinotic would be hallucinogenic mushrooms, and might not be the best idea if you’re not prepared for that possibility. 😅 Also pretty sure Petilil’s leaves are what the super bitter medicines that all your Pokémon hate is made from.
I feel Vanillish would be nice
Don't forget Combee and Vespiquen's honey
ayo trending
Grunty boi became a CHAD how… delightful
Grunty boy has attained the power of arkoos
You made this video awhile ago
I'm going for the seafood. I don't care how bony magikarp is, it should still be good for stock
Torchic is litterallyba nugget
If you eat miltank you eat the sausage nipples 😳
I actually forgot Grunty Boi and Michael were the same person for a sec.
Ah yes I see Michel is a football fan of culture as well Austin Fc I see.
I believe grottle could be on here cuz in the anime we saw starley's and other animals eating the berries off of grottles back and I believe that it could be a good cuisine option
I love pumpkin food to. I always can't wait for pumpkin season to come around.
the skin is shed for appletun, im vegetarian and would totally eat that
how can you miss all the sheep and goats, I would love to try some ice cream made from gogoat’s milk, it’s even in the anime plus wooloo could be edible as well
Pumpkin is also SPECTACULARLY TASTY as a savory dish ! Roasted, with garlic and herbs and salt. Puréed into a sauce with raviolis Blended into a sauce with some egg rolls
"im not going to eat bambi .. ill eat his mom though" 🤨📷 caught in 4k lol
togepi and ice cream were missed
alligator squirrel dove or snake pokemon fried gator  and fried rattle snake squirrel are very good sauteed dove and gravy over rice many more pokemon you could eat
" i would like slowpoke tails on winter day " MCHEAL THERE ARE NO COLD DAYS IN ALOLA
Australian here! Kangaroo meat is one of the best tasting meats on the planet (in my opinion) however it can be very hard to cook properly. So maybe that's why it didn't taste good.
i am a tea person and i would love to try petili tea but its one of my favourite Pokemon 😀
I wonder what classical music Grunty Boy listens to? Shost? Stravinsky? Wagner? Maybe Liszt because of all the transcriptions, it's kind of like stealing. Or maybe he's a Debussy fan.
moomoo milk is aparently said to be sweet and small children often eat it so yes i would drink moomoo milk but also injoy its demise 😉
What about Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe?
I'm vegan so unfortunately I would only eat Jigglypuff.
petition for Mikey to publish a pokemon cookbook 👍🏽
Vanilish i mean the 5th gen ice cream pokemon
Smoliv
Just... Any bird. Especially legendary birds. Really curious if Moltres and Ho-oh would be precooked for me.
I'd go for some spicy wings from Ho-oh. Maybe I'll have perma good luck too.
chansey eggs sound better then any coffee
I would eat buffalaunt criadillas
i would try a lot of pokemon. Who knows maybe whatever diglet is is good
Swirlix is a sweet smelling diabetic dog, so despite some people eating dog, I shall not
Well you could say the rabbits, like Bunnelby and Buneary. It would be difficult to say that about Lopunnuy, but the risk of innuendo would be quite high. Better not fill into that rabbit hole.
Not necessarily food, more like a sweet, but If we imagine that the Vanilluxe line are ice cream cones and not sentient icicles i would be down to try some. I think they would be a pretty refreshing treat on a hot summer day. Maybe not Vanillite considering it is pretty small, but if you don't want a giant ice cream cone, instead just a small "treat", then i think Vanillite would work.
Well actually the reason you can't eat blaziken or torchic is cause I would be forced to kill you
if breloom is a kangaroo, WHERE IN THE HOLY HELL ARE THE EARS?!
Dead miltank.
I love when money brings out his evil side I was just sat laughing to hell when he said that he would “like to eat miltank as he would enjoy the nutrition and the DEMISE”
7:13 it’s the worst
10:47 oh you absolutely get cursed. cursed with a pumpkin spice addiction, that is
I would eat a Dialga... with Thyme of course. XD
What about honey from Combee and Vespiquen? We slather it on trees for pokemon, we can have some too right?
What about the vanniluxe line? They're basically ice cream.
Something funny is that a KFC ad came on when Mikey was talking about chicken
What about the Vanillish line?
SHOULD I BE WORRIED THAT I AGREE WITH MOST OF THESE LOL 🤣
The Vanillite evolution line is a go-to dessert in my opinion.🍦
Appletun could be meat, fruit, or pastry it’s very confusing
Fun fact Mikey, eelectrick and eelectross, despite have eel in their names, are actually based of lamprey, that being said that apperently taste like squid
what about drowzee)
As a person that does like lamb, give me all of them. I could even make a profit! Lamb be expensive 😂
i would be down to try Ho-Oh meat. like imagine how cool it would be to say "yeah, i've eaten a Legendary Pokémon!"
This makes me think that Mikey would enjoy any kind of new pokemon that would come from a Pumpkaboo and an Alcemie.... assuming it's edible....
Never eaten sting ray?
the appletun you actually I think you eat the sugar on his back
A shame you didn't mention milktank coming with four nipple-sausages.
No Combee''s honey?
Raycon is an amazing brand! The ear buds are amazing and Im considering getting the headset or the new buds
Why wouldn't you eat fidough, i usually like both donuts and puppi-
# 001 There's a person who does animations on a chef preparing a meal off of dead Kanto starters and Chikorita. Needless to say, I didn't watch the one where they prepared the Bulbasaur. Look up Brainqueen, it should be on Youtube.   Warning: It's a little bit gruesome. Because you know..........cooking.
6:00 WHAT ABOUT SIRFETCHD
Mikey: I don’t know if Appletuns back counts as fruit or meat. Me: Bruh, that’s a pie, neither of those.
Vegan teacher’s gonna bust that door down any minute now
It’s interesting that a sweet apple turns into Appleton considering you make apple pie with more sour apples (because of all the sugar you add) like Granny Smiths
I would also eat miltank meat and its milk
Someone’s gotta make a pumpkaboo pie recipe using the different ingredients from different Pokémon.
Xernius the big blue deer probably has a lot meet for it’s large size
I would like to try Dragonite and Rayquaza. The dragon meat must be cooked for a long time tho because of the very tough fiber. Oh and also Snorlax. It’s food for an entire month…
the evolution of the Mikey/Grunty Boi arc his first appearance Grunty Boi:HAHA! It is I,Grunty Boi! Mikey:le gasp TEAM ROCKET!?  now Grunty Boi:HAHA! It is I! Grunty Boi! Mikey:hey man
People do it, it must be safe  Smoking: am I a joke to you
I'll just shiny hunt for a farfetch'd and donate all of the breedjects to kitchens around the galar region. Helps with the extinction of the species and with world hunger in the Pokémon world
Vanniluxe line???
Mamoswine is a Wooly Mammoth MAMMOTHS WERE HUNTED TO EXTINCTION BECAUSE THEY TASTED SO DAMN GOOD
I cut pumpkin or butternut squash into slices, add a little black pepper and olive oil and roast them. They go great with roast chicken, turkey or pork.
dude bison meat is fire
I think you should eat a Diglett, clean it from the ground and aha! you have a sousage!
Combusken kicks 10 times a second
What about pumpkin flavored pickles
Hold up!  Are you wearing an Austin FC shirt???  Nice!!! I'm a Union fan but love when I see others that appreciate MLS!
And rabbit meat! 😲
You forgot the vanillite line 🍦😋
The Vanillite line.
3:21 Deerling is too adorable to eat
Hi
It was at this moment I realised Breloom was a kangaroo
If we're eating eel pokemon, why don't we eat the Wiglett and end the barrage of horrible memes😄
Frankly, its not surprising that people eat pokemon. Pokemon are the ONLY source of meat in that world, so if they didn't eat pokemon, they woud just have to live off of herbs grown by farmers. So its really not surprising at ALL when you think about it.
"Plus i hate it, so i would be able to enjoy the flavour, and its  d e m i s e" fucking greatest line ever
@MandJTV you ain’t the only one who would enjoy dining on miltank specifically WHITNEY’S
I didn’t know Mikey was into the MLS! I’m a Sporting Kansas City fan myself but I like Austin FC too!
Another example was at least in the anime, Grotle can produce a hard fruit, and wild pokemon were all over his back eating it. But I forget if it was edible.
it's kinda funny to me you wouldn't eat the pigs that are first evolutions because they're young pigs. meanwhile in portugal, we commonly eat piglets all the time, they're even incredibly popular to eat around christmas and new years
What about whisa whasha imagine it would be the same as sardines.
Petty, absolutely petty, Mikey. I understand the hatred for miltank, but geez. Extremely morally grey! (Nice video, no hate for you and you're pettiness. Have a nice day.)
no execute is exegutors heads
Mythical chef Josh has video on how he cooks pokemon
Who think Mikey should bring boy‘s  lover back! 👇
Kentucky Fried Combusken
muk
Yay! The Wooloos are safe from being eaten by Mikey!
Gardevoir
Just get one slowpoke because the tails regrow
Grunty Boy became a wizard, this is both concerning and exciting lol
i mean, there's people who have rabbits as pets and some treat it like it's a member of the family. meanwhile in several countries, mine included, rabbit is something you eat
The ice cream Pokémon idk the name
Ok but smoliv can also double with olive oil as well as just olives
Vaniilte
Tirtouga could be a reference to the real life giant tortoise, which was so tasty that it took several years too get an official name because everyone that got one just ate it instead of bringing it back for study. So maybe it could be quite tasty. Pretty sure they went extinct because of it too.
Togepi is also viable to eat since it’s basically an egg or at least you could eat it’s egg
What about Fidough? Its a dog made of donuts!
Missing swanna - a very royal dish
Fidough?
i'm not eatting pokemon that just sound mean and awful and I know I eat animals anyways but still
I would also try Ho-oh if they found a way to breed more and it wasn’t considered illegal or sacrilege.
Mmmm Politoed frog legs 😋
Another poultry item that I want to try is swan so swana.  Hunting swans is illegal  in a lot of places and I want to try it so ... yeah
Grunty boi definitely just used a abra
vanillish/ vanilluxe
This has to be my favorite video you’ve put out so far. It was such an interesting concept and a genuinely funny video, and you could really see your personality coming through with how much fun you were having. Keep up the good work!
4:05 - what's with all that hate against Miltank? I love that cow, it's cute and it destroyed Metronome League 1 <3
oh i’ll eat bambi’s mom alright 😈
Could you eat a blue Miltank steak though?
Appletons skin is cake
bro i clicked on this with out reading the title but still i agree on all of these
All you have to do if you want to eat Farfetch is masuda method you get a shiny and you can eat the non shiny Pokémon
ALL THE WILD GAME. I'd eat ALL the Bunelby and Ursaring,  and even some snake or bug pokemon!
Why did you pronounce milcery and Milk-ery?? Is it not pronounced mil-sery cuz it’s a mix of milk and sorcery?
Should we tell him the milktank milk can turn into a milktank? Or not?
appletun is apple pie mikey
3:20 but eat his mom
I would eat seedot
Last video of the john michael cup should be squirdle (wordle but its pokemon)
What's Grunty Boi's favorite game?
If Dodrio is a Ostrich, i will eat  Magikarp and Goldeen are some Fish i probabilly eat too  Octillery is a Octopus; so i wil eat   Grapclot is a Fight octupus, probabilly is hard to kill and cook, but i will enjoy too
Becareful with the vengan teacher 😢
3:23 out of context this sounds sus.
And Miltank is also from Japan, so that means its Japanese Wagyu, wich is even better!
Pumpkin foods aren't actually pumpkin, they're just a blend of seasonings designed to either taste like pumpkin or autumn-y flavours
What about the ice cream 🍦 Pokémon vanilluxe line lol
In some parts of the world, you'll see some street vendors selling some spicy fried galvantulas on a stick. The stand next door would have some politoed legs by the pound.
You like shuckles juice... don't you Mikey 😏
ive seen the original… guess this is one of the videos he wants to recreate?
I don’t care but I think soft serve ice cream is tied with vanilla in my opinion so vanilite and it’s evolutions would be on my list
Chancey eggs are the second coming of Christ and you cannot and WILL not convince me otherwise
Mikey would also love to eat drowsee🤭😏
Surprising that Vanillite, Vanillish and Vanilluxe aparently are not ice cream
Pokemon challenge idea with John- make  a recipe for each other, and catch pokemon for ingredients and after that you make the meals and eat them
Idea for a main or Plays video: A Pokémon S&S Nuzzlocke where, if one on your team members die, not only do you have to release it, but you also then have to set up a picnic and have the main curry dish have a part of it that includes something related to the Pokémon that just died
Wiglets also an eel
Fully expected Farfetch’d to be on this list but it doesn’t change the fact that I was hoping otherwise
Ok so, Grunty is magical. And a pro gamer. When’s the memoir is coming out?
Listen; *Pokémon Eggs* . Should taste like ostrich, and may even have different flavors depending on WHAT Pokémon which would be hatched.  And usually "young" meat is more tender and desirable - so why not deerling. torchic.
From a Lore and Narrative writing perspective I don't think you understand what you've unleashed by giving Grunty Boi magical powers. Power creep incoming.
rowlet is like cilantro on a bird
YOU MISSED COMBEEE!!!!!!!                     plz reply
I didn’t watch the vid yet but I hope there’s fried magikarp
I feel as if exegutor and it’s alolan forms coconuts might be very tasty
Now we need to know every pokemon Mikey would smash
It be crazy if they was kfc in the Pokémon world 🌎 lol
Man, this feels so wrong ngl :))
this is going to sound weird, but i agree with all of that XD As long as i don't need to be the one to cook it, I would also eat them XD😋
14:34 just a random question... what if they end being mixed with moomoo milk? or are they? does it mean Miltank generates them? or are they made of an other pokemon's milk?
Where’s the literal ice cream? Vanillite, vanillish and vanilluxe?
When is the next jhon micheal episode
...now I'm hungry
Calling it now, “I’ll eat his mom tho” is gonna be on pokemon meme review
I can't believe you didn't mention magikarp 😭 they literally show them eating it in the anime so it's definitely Canon.
Chicorita
Kill Miltank gang
I'm super unfamiliar with pokedex entries and was wondering why Sinistea wasn't mentioned. After looking it up, I now understand. "It absorbs the life-force of those who drink it. It waits patiently, but opportunities are fleeting—it tastes so bad that it gets spat out immediately."
"It's not the most outlandish thing canonical to the Pokemon world" MandJTV smash or pass when
Fidough
What about octillary?
but why doesn't people like mutton! it's delicious! (just drybrine it with salt and rosemary like an hour before you fry it kinda like a steak and it's amazing!)
Pheasant is actually pretty good so I stand by that decision
8:45 nope, that's meat. It's like for our seasoning. When used in a marinade, apple juice will help tenderise meat and while it is cooking, the apple juice gives a distinctive barbecue flavour to food as it caramelises.
EAT WIGLET!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:51 You're going to skip the Exeggcute line?
"I'll eat his mom though"💀
I thought he’d say “I’d eat miltank, every damn one of them
The first one what the hell 🤣🤣
The ice cream pokemon very tasty
Hey, if you want eel meat, why not Wigglet?
okay since i havent found a comment stating this i have to be the guy...  I'd eat Gardevoir IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
What about fidough?
Honestly who don't love some spicy kfc
7:43 Petilil is like a real plant we have and yes it's a bug repellent we can drink. Lemongrass contains an oil called citronella, a common mosquito repellent. Swap your summer glass of lemonade for a chilled glass of lemongrass tea or carefully use lemongrass oil on your skin for a quick mosquito repellent.
Unless the ghost added something to the taste of the pumpkin, why bother exorcising a pumpkaboo when you could  just eat an unpossesed pumpkin?
Magic carp I feel like would be pretty good
Im wrong for saying this... Gardevoir😂  Edit: this is a complete joke don't tane it seriously
Being British I’d with a sinistea
I am using Raycons to listen to this video right now.
I figure that the way people treat some Pokémon as food in-universe is likely similar to how we treat animals IRL.   Some people may eat feral dogs, but no sane person would eat an individual dog designated as a pet. An individual animal or Pokémon someone is attached to emotionally (to a significant enough degree) wouldn’t eat said individual.
Uh oh…
7:08 there was a dish made from Paras btw. It was like the boiled crabs you eat at the restaurant with its mushrooms as sauce.
All this video did was make me want to say that I’d be a vegetarian if Pokémon were real
As a Bostonian,, that was wicked awful kid, you are tryin' too hahd to do the accent. Although you have chosen the superior clam chowdah so I'll forgive you.
Glad to see another bison meat enjoyer. Coincidentally, I just had a bison burger for lunch yesterday 🍔🍔.
What about oddish
Can you do Pokémon recipes?
Mikey do you have some child we do not know of?
Mikey: “People do it. It must be safe” 7:40  Gen Z: “cinnamon, tide pods, sleepy chicken, skullcrusher challenge, …”
What if Mikey one day just said: “alright guys… I have to come clean… I actually don’t hate Miltank that much”?
Out of context SHUCKLES JUICE
"Lechonk is too small" I mean it's perfectly marbled, so it probably goes a long way
Pls don't eat Vanilla the Alcremie. If you try I will Gmax her and she'll cream your head off.
Apparently grass is blue 🤷‍♂️. Thought it was red but I think mine is a different kind.
You forgot Fidough
I'd eat moltres. It looks like a giant chicken. Of course I'd try magikarp too
Did you not mention the ice creams or did I miss them?
That sabbatical really did wonders. I can sense a different energy with these recent videos. Appreciate all of the work you put out. You and everybody in here, please continue to be safe.
i just realized the starters like torchic and tepig are rare because people hunted them 0-0
I remember they said slowpokes' tail takes time but regrows am I remembering it wrong? Was that a lie of my childhood? Because nobody lied to me about farfetch'd being cooked with the leek and going nearly extinct!!!
Didn’t 10 year olds get these dex entries? Doesn’t that mean the kids ate shuckle juice? Did these kids get drunk off of it if it was wine?
14:33 You lost an opportunity to make a family guy joke
Haha HSI Grand tip boy
You missed smolive
I'll be surprised if the whole video isn't just how to cook a miltank
Also Alcreamie's gigantamax form is LITERALLY a CAKE
Grunty Boy is from Johto it seems. He's rocking the magic XD
What about combees honey🍯
Try pumpkin cookies with glaze
I know that this is strange for people living in non West European countries, but hear me out, Binacle and Barbaracle are based in one of the tastiest molluscs in the world: barnacles. They are mostly breed in the north of Spain (where I live in), Portugal and France, and they are incredibly good, I know it sounds weird, but trust me, they are.
Miltank... sausages? XD
"I seem to have forgotten what grass is like. It's blue, right?" No, Grunty Boi, it's not blue, it's green. Don't come to Alberta to verify, though, because it just snowed up here. As far as I know, grass is white.
Personally Id eat all but the mushrooms and Oyster ones. But I would also like to try Lileep, and a custom pokemon I came up with; Shucker and its evolution: Loleepop. Which both of them are basically sheep with a sucker/lolipop combined
How much for a wagyu Miltank steak?
I would eat the Vanillite line as well
Magikarp!
i think magikarp would be good too.
I mean, someone helped the lapras population rebuild. I'm sure someone could help bring back the farfetch'd population, then help make sustainable lifestock populations...
Sharpedo, octillery, bulasaur, alakazam (because of dex entry), execute, and brokshish are all mons I would all enjoy eating that were not mentioned loved vid keep it up (:
Aye girl you wanna try my shuckle juice?
ON THE PUMPKIN PIE!😂
You forgot Fidough Mikey.
You forgot Vanillite
Actually, in 2nd Gen games, if you give to hold Shuckle a berry, there is a chance it becomes berry juice after a battle. I would be awesome to still have such mechanic just for fun xD
You really think Unfezant is the dumbest regional bird? Pidgeot and Swellow are right there
This is an…interesting video idea……….
Gmax appleton and gmax alcreamy a
Grass is blue right? Yeah half of lotad is blue and that comes from its grass type
I'm from Boston and you did a very good Boston accent.
In Alcremie’s dex entry it says that if it likes its trainer it will offer pieces of itself to them to eat.
I can’t decide what’s better at this point. The actual video or how god tier the grunty boi promos are
Ayo, what does he mean by "I won't eat Bambi, I will eat his mum though"?!?!??
Combuskin is too spicy
captions for intro: "gory teams for events, michael here""  oh god
grunty boi is no longer a team rocket member😢 if u can’t touch grass you can’t steal
Kangaroo meat is actually very good when prepared well or maybe we just like different things
So many great out of context lines in this one!
What would dragon taste like?
I would definitely eat an ursaring or Beartic. Bear meat is great!
me in the corner eatting bunnelbee: lol umm
You have forgotten about the vanillite line.
7:44 Drugs, drinking and driving, murder
as someone of greek heritage who lives literally 1 block away from the best greek place in america, i LOVE lamb  altho ngl i would eat charizard and klefki
Fidough
Mikey: "People do it, so it must be safe!" TikTok Challenges: *Heavy breathing*
What about pumpkin melon smoothie?
You've gotta try Lechonk, or at least its evolved form.
Okay, who's going to make the Cloyster joke
How was magikarp not on here😭 You also could’ve added frogs for frog legs
mans realy trying to exciroze a pumpkin to eat it now thats commitment
I would eat combee's honey but not beedrill's it's more of a wasp than a bee also it's poison type
Dying at the "I could never eat Bambi! I'd eat his mom, though." 😂
Mikey why not eat Fidough? Gotta love bread.  Or they use its yeast at least in the pokedexentre
this was an amazing video but HE FORGOT THE ICE CREAMS 🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦
The most morally questionable part of this vid is him putting ranch on chicken wings instead of blue cheese
I wonder about the alligators?
In the entry about shuckle it says the berries are mixed it's body fluids to make juice and according to Mikey the berries are fermented I just have 1 query: which " body fluids" are the berries being fermented in?  Because I don't know about the rest of you but I wouldn't want to be drinking pinap berry mixed with shuckle urine 🫠🤮
But consider this: Tepig bacon is already cooked
Hmm, I wonder why drowzee wasn’t on this list. I’m sure you eat drowzee up every day 😂     Pokemen7 Totally didn’t tell me to send this
raycon is an obvious scam and a useless cancer that should NOT exist
Okay, now I've thought of using Snover berries with the Shuckle juice to make the best cold drink ever. Now, Appltun folds (yes, those weird band-aid like things on it's back will be called folds from now on. I've decided.), and apparently surskit can have syrup produced from its antenna thing so I'd like its syrup with the Appltun fold things.
First make Farfetch'd cook for you then cook Farfetch'd itself, so friendly and delicious
In Pokemon Journeys, there was an episode where they actually used Alcremie's cream to make cakes, so it's definitely not out of the question.
Why does this seem so familiar
Woolo is 100% good
Day 1 of waiting someone from China to say he forgot the dog Pokemon
As with the slowpoke tail situation, I tend to say that what Team Rocket did was not only forcing the peeling of the tails, but also selling a most likely luxurious product illegally, probably for way higher prices. Basically, slowpoke tail scalping (kind of).
Pal world video coming soon guys.
The pro gamer grass joke is the funniest thing ever. But everyone knows it’s red
“I’ll eat his mom though”- Michael 2022
Do witch you'd marry next time, just to get every wierd thing (as a collection)
Really your not going to eat a vanillite, vanillish, or a vanillux
Mikey: "I'd eat his mom though!"
you lost me at pumkin spice
Mikey: outright consuming pokemon  Me: w h a t .
HOLD UP. If you killed a G-Maxed kingler it could feed an entire nation. Basically if we chose to kill Godzilla for food. And yes this is as messed up as it seems
Funnily enough I discussed what Pokémon would be tastiest a while ago with a friend, and although the context was having a drawing of a pokegirl who looked psychotic and that she would eat the skitty she was holding in the picture, we actually said that Breloom would probably be high on the list. Maybe not by itself, but it’s giant mushroom head must taste delectable, surely
I would Try the Dove Soup that was served in the past we all know which pokemon would fit. I would test Frogs, they might be tasty. Shark meat is pretty good. And i always wanted to try seal meat.
Hmm.. So you want to help decrease the Basculin population by eating them?   Sounds to me like someone is trying to make Basculegion come back to the modern day 🤔
What has miltank done to be Mikey arch enemy?😂
Fidough
Bison meat? Being from UK I'm super jelly. Suppose my flex on you is that venison meat is pretty common here.
wait is doduo edible?
Morally grey Mikey is so much fun! This was hilarious.
How does anyone eat a Grumpig? . . . They're psychic. They'll know way before you that you're going to eat them
Fun fact, the same taste receptors that let you taste bitter also taste salt, so adding salt to bitter things can counteract the bitterness.
11:41 clauncher and clawitzer are shrimp.
Thank you for not eating my beloved magikarp
Lopunny
Grotle also grows berries on it's back sometimes.
You forgot tyrouge
I have autism. The shirt feels personal. Poke food ew. I don't want to eat with my friends. Kill miltank. Ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA
By the way did you now that baby dear meat is vary soft
11/10
You have now proposed a question I have never thought I would have in my 17 years of playing pokemon. If you eat a fruit/plant pokemon, is it considered carnivorous or herbivorous?
Anything  edible at  least  once. Yes,  that  includes pikachu   it's  taste   could be  *shockingly* good.
I'll eat his MOM though... WHY!!!
Combee's honey!!!!
I would love to eat a Clefable to punish them for being annoying to face. They’re also like walking Cotten candy.
I was considering whether Togepi counts as an egg, but I think since you would have to kill it in order to eat it, I would probably not. (I am a vegetarian.)
Lopunny
Has Grunty Boi become Gamer Boi???
Yum bounsweet
I would eat a Gardevoir 🤤. Oh you meant to eat like to consume oh ok then in that case Ash's Pikachu so I can see him cry lol😋.
I've heard Koi can be quite tasty. I however am not a fan of seafood, but Seaking might be enjoyed by others.
Everything you said in this video is just a meme
“I’m not gonna eat Bambi. I’ll eat his mom though” Wrong on many levels but hilarious I love the Miltank spite
What about the ice cream pokemon
I love how he kept talking about fermentation, and the dex entry on-screen just says "mix".
This vid got me dead 💀
Combee honey sounds good!
"I'm not gonna eat Bambi... But I'll eat his mom though" that got me
“I’ll eat his mom though”-M&JTV 😂😂😂😂🤣 even funnier taken out of context
Play cuphead now
*cough* viridian city wet market*
Mikey, I would love to see your most amazing Pokémon flavored dish that you want to make/eat! Because of this video I'm intrigued with what you can come up with.
What about Fidough?
The Galapagos Tortoise's early descriptions were about how tasty it was because they never made the trip back for research, so maybe it's just human nature to try eat everything 😂
Where are the ice cream, Magikarp and Feebas lines? I'm convinced that Milotic would be delicious.
OMG MIKEY
Great Video
fidough
Wait for the vegan teacher to see this
I'll eat anything from bugs to dogs (of course i don't eat dogs) but I always wondered what they'd taste like.  I'd also eat all the cactus Pokemon, very common in Mexico.
Miltank wagyu
Grunty boy now canonically doesn’t touch grass
Mikey out of context: "I'll eat his mom tho"
Love to see the austin fc kit
The totodile line but not the Sandile line because ......... sand
This is so interesting. Not many people realize the amount of things you can make with Pokémon parts or the Pokémon themselves. There needs to be a Pokémon cooking game where you use different Pokémon ingredients to make food. The ingredients are not the flesh of the mon just like the milk or fruit
Just ask team rocket to cut some nice juicy slowpoke tail 🤣
What about Drowzee?
The one thing is that slurpuff…is just a regular dog…it’s fur is sweet due to its diet but…otherwise your just eating a dog
What happened to grunty girl
I’d eat the Vanilluxe line because they’re ice cream cones with a face. It’d be better if they came in different flavors that would change the color of their form based on their flavor
Out of context is eating better then you
Ahh...how about the literal ice cream cone pokemon??? Also, while bear meat is kinda fatty it's still pretty good and manly as hell 🤷‍♂️
"I'd eat his mom though" LMAO
...um, any one going to tell em that swerlix is a dog, or at least some what dog inspired, and it's not just sentient cotton candy, I mean we see it's feet aren't the same as it's body, so that's probably just fur.
Also you missed vanilluxe
You forgot BDG’s most edible Pokémon, Togepi!
7:48 😃 im to unmature for this💀
I think you shoul'd give Grunty boy a Chanel
Most relatable grunty boi also save the pidoves
Hey did you know vaporeon is the most eatibile pokemon for human
Grunty boi get ratioed+touch grass+skill issue
I think PurpleCliffe would like to eat tsareena, gardevoir and lopunny
9:56 Pumpkin Ravioli?
Grunty Boi the pro gamer can compete with Ultra Instinct Shaggy
Shouldn't eat the alcremie line, cuz they can produce more cream and milk by fairy magic every single day😂 instead of forcibly being taken by killing them.
If Mikey lived in the Pokémon universe, I feel like Miltank would have a similar entry to farfetch’d
What about fidough?
about Slowpoke: since Sword and Schild I thought if they had reliesed it as Alola Slowpoke and not Galarien Slowpoke the story of the tails  could have been just a Regional-Form thing. That because of the Alolan Inviroment the Slowpokes aquiered the ability to regenerate their tailes to increase their Chance of survivel while living on an Island/ multiple Islands.  By it being a regional trait it doesn't invalid the story with Team Rocket in Gold/Silver/Christal/HG/SS.  Do you get my thought process?
@3:21 sus
hi
Today I learned that Chasey's eggs have MDMA.
I meen piloswine is prehostoric
Piloting is prehistoric
3:22` WHAT DID HE SAY
Pokémon talk pls
Grunty boi turned inro a psycic Type😂
3:57 male or female?
You did this video before didn't you?
I'd love to eat Wooloo, lamb is an aboslutely amazing meat. Also Gogoat cheese must be similar to goat cheese so it must be amazing. Also Octillery since octopus is delicious.
Honestly maybe Grumpigs meat will make you smarter…
gnocchi with pumpkin cream?
Eat rayqaza 😅
Grunty boy has learned magic!
Ethical slowpoke tails that's for fine team rocket were forcefully doing and trying to crash the market for it
Bro needs to start a restaurant if pikemon were to exist
A Mareep gyro would be incredible
Forgot to mention drowzee's juice though
7:39 "People do it, it must be safe" Tide Pod challenge be like:
Mikeys fav food is miltank
Vanilite
So I guess you're not into (sm)olives?
Gmax alcremie
I guess Polteageist tea could be another beverage you could drink. Granted the Shield entry states that drinking it can send chills down your spine. Also the Shield entry for its phony form describes pouring itself into left over tea to make new Polteageist. Like a spectral Kombucha.
Nahhh grunti boi is an average basement dweller
This video is so based!
No combee or vespiquen honey? 🤔
Also I’m from central mass and his accent isn’t bad, but needs work
Octillery? octopus is a little different to squid but is still tasty. Diggersby/Azumarill? Rabbit stew is a traditional dish in the UK and isn't too gamey. Most of the basic fish pokemon? A tin of Wishiwashi would be analagous to sardines/anchovies right?  And of course, as someone who has eaten a crocodile steak some thought must be put forth towards the Krookodile line.  Slightly more tneuous but: any bats and sharks for chinese dishes. Garchomp Fin Stew anyone? Or a bat nest soup?
To dispair from PM7, some frogs are eatable in real life, and also good for kids with breath desiases like Bronquitis... So, Poliwag, Politoad, Frogardier and some other frogs are eatable!
Its so weird seeing Mikey just in middle, I'm used to him jumping from right to left lol
A Pokémon food video without Vanillish? Blasphemy!
Kombust-fil-A 6:22
‘I’d get to enjoy its flavor….and it’s demise’ lmao
Things like peppermint and catnip are commonly used as natural bug repellents so Petalil might just taste like a lovely peppermint tea
Honestly  I would drink miltank's milk
IDK if this is mentioned by someone else, but MINT is a natural bug repellent that humans eat frequently.  Petilil is likely minty.
This was a fun video. I think the dex entry of Slowpoke's tail was only added that it drops off do to people feelings regarding them being cut off.  Team rocket and others stated this in a number of games.
But Mikey, you are what you eat...🐮
*"..Ill eat his mom tho."* 💀
Mikey’s next nuzlocke: If it faints, I eat it
Hatterene, Gardevoir, and Lopunny are Pokémon I would eat 👀👀
Amazing idea for a spooky month video.
Imagine putting Milcery into a hot pan with Velveeta, or Alcremie into a piping hot cup of coffee lol. Or cutting into A gigantamax Alcremie for a slice of cake 😂😂😂 Happy birthday here's your Alcremie cake. Blow out the candles and make a wish for it to stop screaming when you make the first cut
My favorite Pumkaboo ended up on the list and to get back at Mikey im gonna call him mickey mickey mickey mickey mickey
Forgot rabbit i think
Coffee plants use their caffeine to ward off insects
“I’ll eat his mom though”
Pokémon electric chicken wings
This is why you’re my Mikey is my favourite Pokémon YouTuber 🤣 I talk about this a lot, and I am very passionate about my desire to eat a Kingler
Smoliv
Ima make a miltank steak for my lechonk in scarlet and violet
Magikarp you missed magic cop
Machamp would be delicious
Mikey you like to eat??? I never knew this. . .
So you are saying that you would eat the sausage nipples...    Okay
Can you eat Porygon if it's just data?
Technically you should not eat miltank since it is a dairy cow and you do not eat those
Wait hear me out is cumbuskin's meat cooked automatically
Someone needs to draw a thanksgiving meal but it’s all Pokémon lmao
I may try to get the raycon headphones because literally any other headphones I’ve bought or was gifted just backfired and something never worked.
Why did I just realize that you have to spin to evolve milcery because milcery is cream and by spinning it becomes whipped cream
I'd eat durant
I literally rewatched the sword and shield pokedex entries video where you mention how you'd eat barraskewda XD
Bee vitamin.... Yup
chikorita 🙃
"we are glossing over the fact that you just did actual magic" I was dead for 10 minutes
I've always wanted to eat a mr mime
What about fidough?
What about the vanillice line?
Honestly, I'd try a Rare Candy.
Limenade, Eat or don't   Mikey: Hold my beer
I'll give you a pass for the Boston accent. Granted, I'm a lot more west in Massachusetts, and the accent sort of dwindles down the farther you get from Boston. Also, New England clam chowder is the way to go, and Manhattan chowder is garbage. Why in the heck would you put tomatoes in it? I wish I could have clam chowder again, but lactose intolerance. 😩
No wooloo eating
I just got a shiny pumpkaboo (which was on my third egg of the hunt im so happy about that) and im so glad that purple pumpkins do not sound appetizing
Idea pumpkin gingerbread just saying
2:21 ammmm you might want to read it "mixes with its body fluids"...... what do you think is that fluid? Water that it got from a river??
Chikorita the pear pokemon, and vanilish if you had snow cone syrup
Ah yes the sequel/remaster is here!
Dear Michael. I want to take a minute to say something about this video. Normally, I love all your videos, but this one I watched with tears in my eyes, and not in a good way. Its the year 2022, and you are still talking about eating innocent animals. I think you can't do that anymore. I am so sorry to see one of my heroes being so ignorant. I seriously cant watch you anymore now. Please stop eating meat, its cruel and kills the world
Exeggutor is even listed as the "Coconut Pokemon". Doduo/Dodrio are ostriches. Also any of the crocodile/alligator type pokemon too as they are eaten in many parts of the world
You forgot the ice cream pokemon.
3:22 That got dark real fast, considering the fact that you might be aware of what exactly happend with his mother...
Mmmm, Klingklang, Sigilyph, Golurk, Stakataka, and Magnezone 🤤🤤🤤   I hunger…
There was a game theory video explaining what pokemon you should eat and for poultry Matpat suggested Hoot Hoot.
Magikarp???!!???
You missed Machoke, I for one would totally machoke on that...
I would love to have well cooked Noctowl
dude said sweat
grass is green grunty boi. *it’s green.*
whens the Pokemon Cooking Mama series coming out, and why is the protagonist already decided on Mikey?
3:23 I connected to my Bluetooth speaker at the worst possible part in the video
I've had rabbit before and it is quite good. Therefore I would def eat Buneary or Lopunny. Lopunny especially would have a lot of meat because of those legs. I wouldn't eat Scorbunny though. Too small.
Gardevoir.  Seriously though, I'm very interested in having Chansey deviled eggs.
Mamoswine is a pig???
Mikey, if you eat to much miltank the money the miltank foundation will make will supply more miltank.
I needed this today!😁
I'd think that eating some bug pokemon like caterpie would be fairly tasty if covered in chocolate. If durant wasn't steel type, then you could easily do the same thing because chocolate covered ants
Not gonna try and enjoy a tasty frozen treat?
You missed Octillery  You missed a chance to have some takoyaki
I would Pansage but not the Pokémon just the leaves on its head cuz in the anime Cilan’s Pansage was shown removing some of the leaves off his head and feeding it to other Pokémon so therefor those leaves have gotta be delicious
So your telling you wouldn’t eat Wiglett
Mikey: "People do it, it must be safe" People: This highly poisonous spiky baloon fish looks delicious!
You forgot to add Drowsey to the list
What about the ice cream pokemon
This video is the perfect mix of cursed and hilarious. bravo
A 'pokemon' cooking game would be fun
What about the vanillite line? They are ice cream! Also now, I imagining someone breeding these Pokémon to run a restaurant with food from Pokémon. Like a moo moo milkshake with cherubi’s cherry and a small mound of milcery on top
Vanillite
Michael david gilbert
5:22-5:27  Welcome to Boise, Idaho
This video is way too sus 😂😂😂
Before the poke tree huggers start lashing out... Do you really think a Gyarados wouldn't eat you?
🤤
I don't eat alot of pork,but I  do eat a lot of other meats. You forgot gator shark and snake meat
I agree with a lot of these choices! Though I personally am not a fan of oysters or venison, so I wouldn’t eat the Pokémon associated with those. I’m not sure if you skipped this because you don’t like octopus, but Octillary sounds like it would be pretty good. It doesn’t say anywhere that it wouldn’t be edible, and in the ultra moon dex it even says that octillery ink is used in cooking. Even if octollery itself wouldn’t be edible, some octillery ink pasta definitely sounds good!
The Pumpaboo section let me know that Mikey is part of a massive pumpkin spice problem
Is the Vanilluxe line based on ice cream, or just ice crystals?
I would like to see Pokemon go further into detail about the food chain in the pokemon world
The tumbnail, bro!
If you ever go to Maryland go to hoppers crab house in ocean city they have the best crabs
Pidove is basically squab
"I'll eat his mom, though" Mikey 2022
Very disappointed that you didn't include Drowzee's colors
I'm pretty sure Drowzee should be on this list...
hi
Did you know swirlix only smells like cotton candy? Mikey? It’s not cotton candy.
3:22 sounds awful taken out of context LOL
I choose to believe that grunty boi impresses his lady friend with his new gamer magic
I'm pretty sure that Team Rocket harvesting and selling slowpoke tail was bad because the slowpoke were wild and they were hurting and harvesting from the pokemon illegally. Slowpoke tail sold i restaurants are probably from farmed and regulated.
I went from a guy making $2 steak, to a steak guy reacting to that other guy's video on steak, to Mikey's video with a miltank steak thumbnail.  Well looks like the universe is telling me to eat steak
Vanilluxe says hi 🥲🥲
Similar story to the slowpokes in real life.   Have you ever heard of shark fin stew?    People catch sharks cut off their fins while they’re still alive and dump them into the water again while they’re still alive.     Fun fact.   Sharks need to keep moving or else they drown and without their fins they can’t move thus causing a slow painful drowning and all for a bowl to stew.      The question is though.   Do slowpoke use they’re tails to swim.   Given they break off painlessly and very easily I imagine their used for distracting predators similar to lizard tails.   Do they grow back however?   I haven’t that much Pokémon so I wonder if there is a dex entry stating they do grow back if anyone would like to tell me.
...Vanilite, perhaps?
gosh darn it, you made me want some Pumpkin Bars now
the icecream pokemon. grottle grew nuts on its bush in the anime (dont even)
The only thing I can say is that beef would most likely come from Tauros because Miltank is a dairy cow, and since dairy cows are bred for milk, they usually have poor-quality meat.
Why do i think diglett would be delicious
great vid
would like to remind you of the Vanilluxe line, all of which are just sentient ice cream. i would like to try the sentient ice cream
No magikarp?
"I'm not gonna eat Bambi... I'll eat his mom though!" -Mikey 2022
Mikey! I like miltank! 😛
7:41 there are many spices and herbs that repel insects that are perfectly safe for human consumption.
This gave me the same vibe as Markiplier's Pokemon video.
I would eat wooloo 1000%
Where is vinilux
So... can we acknowledge Grunty Boi getting frighteningly more powerful?
This video had 69,424 views when I clicked on it. So close...
Never thought I'd hear him say he'd eat bambii's mom
The weird pumpkin thing I was pumpkin spice spam
I would say that you forgot vanillite/vanillite’s evolution line but tbf it is literally just ice in the shape of ice cream.
He didn't even mention the Icecream pokemon neither Fidough (although it might be just dough).
No Vanillish? No ice cream!?
Torchic nuggets
Ah yes of course. Grunty Boy: world class criminal, household nuisance, actual wizard and most importantly  🔥P R O  G A M E R🔥
Just to let you know, Mikey, a lot of herbs are bug repellents. Basil, Bay Leaves, Garlic, Sage, Thyme, Mint, Chives, even Cilantro are known to repel bugs, the listed ones even repel specific bugs. So it’s not at all strange for Petilil’s leaves being bug repellent and edible.
I wonder if there's enough information out there to do a video on Pokemon items that you would eat.
I would probably eat exeggcute providing the seeds are delicious when roasted. I enjoy sunflower seeds so i would also probably eat sunflora honestly.
Next video - "every pokemon I would marry" You know what the people want mikey. Deliver!
Grunty becomeinga gamer god
What about octopus
Okay. I don't like having to remind people of this, but whatever. The pumpkin flavour is different from pumpkin spice. Pumpkins themselves don't taste that special, it's only when you add the pumpkin seasonings that make it taste good. Pumpkin spice is a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, along with various other spices, but those are the main ones. So a "pumpkin spice flavoured anything" doesn't have pumpkin in it. It has cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Not pumpkin.  Baby power, on the other hand, definitely has babies in it.
*Haha it is i Gunt Ti Boy*  Mikey: i want Shuckle Juices  *TaTa*
“Explicitly stated to be tasty: Cherubi’s small ball.”
I used to think grass was red now thanks to grunty boi I now it's blue
I agree
Mikey At A Restaurant With Cooked Miltank In It Be Like: I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE POPULATION
Why were those just my top 50 favorite Pokemon without certain enetries
YOU HADME AT PUMPKMIN SPICE!
Theres no laws against the pokemin batman!
Fidough?
Id eat a Lopunny 😏😏
Smoliv and fidough look like food too. I would not eat fidough but maybe smoliv.
Wooloo and dubwool
In the first two minutes you already calling out my favorite Pokémon chuckle in Slowbro
GRUNTY BOI IS A SORCERER edit: Nevermind this mad man is a realitybender.
Nice. "Multi Bee vitamin"
"im not gonna eat bamby but I'll eat his mom tho" -mikey 2022
“People do it so it must be safe” is a *VERY* _very_ dangerous assumption to make
I would eat alakazam... maybe. One of the pokedex entries states that if it trusts you, it would let you have one of its spoons, and anything you eat from it will taste delicious. I would like to try that out.
Mikey has a secret plan to make miltank go extinct by just eating all of those, which i am on board with with because i too hate miltank with a *burning passion* even tho i usually try to eat as less meat as i can. Miltank can die thats fine
Nooo, not Unfezant.
i'm so glad you didn't include magikarp
Surprised Fidough wasn’t mentioned honestly. Like just stick it in an oven and boom, fully cooked bread loaf
7:13. If kangaroo is cooked properly it is delicious. I’m Australian, I eat it every now and then, not to often cause skippy. But odd occasions.
'I'll eat his mom though.'  MandJTV - 2022
You forgot chickarida leafs
Hey look, I found one of those remake videos he was talking about! (Still as great as the first version)
Your videos are getting weird but better 😂
Shiny Yveltal, because it looks like bacon
From the Pokémon picnic in Scarlet and Violet it basically confirmed that they eat Lechonk since they use ham in the recipe
"I'll eat his mom though" - Michael 2022
@mandjtv I am from Morton Illinois and we are the proud PUMPKIN CAPITOL OF THE WORLD! Every mid September our town throws a huge multiple day festival in celebration of PUMPKINS. We have PUMPKIN EVERYTHING. Including the best pumpkin product PUMKPKIN ICE CREAM!!!! I hereby invite all of the people in the comments section and especially MIKEY to attend next year's festivities!
I vibe with the "I hate miltank and will eat it if I could" statement.
For saying you would eat a slowpoke tail, I am going to tell you one you missed. a nice, refreshing, hail form Castform snow cone. Hope you're happy.
Nah grass is red
herdier 100%
I’d kill for a Tepig roast
I feel like Mikey would eat Miltank to complete extinction and I'm fine with that.... As long as I got to eat some of that delicious steak myself.
..... you forgot fidough
i thought he already made this vid a few years ago
I would make the counter-argument that just because a Poke'mon STINKS doesn't mean it's inedible... you've heard of Cheese that STINKS, haven't you?  I think stinky food is still food.  Just... for acquired tastes...
# pumpkin EVRYTHING
You missed the Vanilluxe line they’re literally just ice cream.
I'd eat Pumpkaboo and it's evolution too
now we know how bambi's mother died!
Because of this video, there's only one thing I should ask... Mikey cooking vid when?
scurturtule
“People do it. It must be safe” No
vanillux?
Give me a Combusken and whatever the Pokémon world uses for ranch dressing, and I will be happy!
Ah yes grunty Boi always there when Micheal needs to advertise a sponser
I guarantee you that eating murelul will get you high
Mikey looks way too excited at the idea of eating Pokemon and now im hyped aswell
Eat a wiscash
I'd eat lopunny
My headcanon with Pokémon=food theme is that when Arceus created mew and mew eveolved into the rest of the Pokémon(and humans) most of them become more intelligent/the same level of intelligence as humans do, while the other part of pokemons aren't so smart. Pokémons which are smart, can develop link with its trainer and can communicate with them telepathically(red as the example of that link), but those prey pokemon can't do that, and is basically a real animal, that can use power, rather than a human like intelligent animal. I want to hear that you think about it.
Why would you eat miltank?
9:27 this one in particular confused me, you mentioned that in sword and shield dex entries, I’m a little bit loss on this.
"I'll eat his mom though!" This has been your daily dose of Michael out of context.
Mikey, you are a menace to Gourgeist and Pumpkaboo
Thank you for helping me make my Scarlet team
By the way, swirlix is not actually cotton candy, it is a dog that eats so many sweets, it looks like it. Just thought that was an important detail before eating it
You should do a playthrough video of Pokemon Sweet and it's sequel, Sweet 2th
My thoughts on the appletun skin thing is that maybe it involves how reptiles shed their skin (for context ur not supposed to pull off a reptiles shedding skin but maybe because this is a pokemon it's okay), or maybe how humans technically shed skin cells everyday, maybe appletun is just constantly shedding the skin thats on its back
7:11 I didn’t know people eat kangaroos! This is news to me! Personally I sort of expected you to mention miltank! But in all honesty these are some good options to say the least!
Hey I lost my huntal card have you seem it Mike
Pumpkaboo Spice Lattes  Also Vanilluxe
You could probably add Octillery to the list since not only is grilled octopus delicious but its ultra moon dex entry says that the ink that Octillery spits is used for cooking kind of like how squid ink is used for some pasta or rice dishes.
“I’ll eat his mom though”  MIKEY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
I can’t blame you for wanting to eat Pumkaboo and Gourgeist. I personally have an insane love for pumpkin soup
I feel like you really need to play Bugsnaxs after this video 😂😂😂
Gogoat
I did not know grumpig existed until this video
100% agree with this list
I feel weirdly uncomfortable watching this
I just saw a 25 year old talking about eating imaginable creature that can attack dangerously
Fun Fact: a brazilian youtuber made a similar video, but talking which pokemon, of the whole national dex were inspired by Edible species, can I post it here as a bit of compare and contrast?
Have you not seen the Kantonian Fried Torchic from Dorkly?
i think you skip magikarp
He really said he’d drink miltanks milk 🥛🤤😏
Famous words of grunty boi: what color is grass? Isn’t it blue?
The Bunnelby and Maril lines are based off of rabbits, but I don't trust their tastes. And the scorebunny line seems too human.
Is lack of confirmation the only thing stopping us from Fidough 🤔
Clippers are going to have a hay day with this one
So basically, let's send grunty boi to touch grass. literally.
Can we get someone to draw all of these foods? (Like the more cool ones)
Piloswine is not pork it is a mammoth
What about vanilite
I love your vedios
"Not Deerling though. I'm not gonna eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom though" That is officially my new favorite Mikey quote
Bravo to Grunty Boi for his expanded portfolio….and apparently his acceptance into hogwarts🤯
but do slowpoke tails regrow? i dont want my partner to be tailess :(
Ponyta might be pretty good 🤷‍♂️
fidough looks yummy
I'd eat Gogoat
I would love to try the vanillux line as well as a Gmax Alcremie :)
What about Dodrio, Octillery, and Vanilluxe
You bastard. I was okay until you got to combusken. 😢😢😢😢😢
Roasted pumpkin is similar to sweet potato.
8:23
Pumpkin can go well with meat too, specifically pumpkin curry served in a carved out pumpkin bowl.
"Can you beat pokemon... with food pokemon?''
He will make the miltank population extinct
BRING BACK METRONOME LEAGUES
PETA has entered the chat
If I lived in the pokemon world I would open a slaughterhouse/ restaurant  Miltank steak with a sauteed mushroom sauce with a shuckle side wine $18.99
I understand not wanted the eggs because you moved on from it being a eggs and admit that they are seeds, but why not the coconuts. Heck, Exeggutor heads can BECOME exeggute
Just eat the Miltank alive to maximize suffering
Goregiust + alcecream + unpeasant = Thanksgiving dinner
At least you won't make John even more sad after mentioning Piloswine by saying you'd try any of the frog legs. He loves his frogs.
I’m surprised Mikey didn’t say anything about the Vanilite family
Eat…   Deez nuts
People do eat pokemon but they do so without killing this is how : go taurus and pinsir pinsir us guillotine and chop off taurus s hind quarters now taurus has no  hindquarters and is "dead" now bring it to a pokemon center and because pokemon are primarily made of energy it will grow back it's lost body parts and now you have extra meat
Surely Arkoos has the most exquisite taste in the entire Pokémon universe
you forgot smoliv
“Fry it up, serve it to me on a plate” 😂 Living in the South isn’t perfect… but dadgummit this mindset is!😂
Wait Shuckle makes wine?
I’m guessing drowzee is one of the Pokémon in this video
I like that you can eat slowpoke tail in a few of the games.
I'm questioning weither or not to try any of the Vanilite line. It is a set of ice cream cones
I would eat pokemon
Grunty Boi is becoming too powerful
I forgot what grass was its blue right?
you frogot wishiwashi
I know you said you didn't like lamb but Wooloo Chops sound INCREDIBLE
Yo forgot vanilluxe line🍦
Vanillite would taste great
The amount of memes that are going to emerge from this episode… amazing
u missed rare candy.................................... i wonder what it tasteslike
Both it’s flavor, and it’s demise.
I would try dragonite and charizard
What about the Ice Cream Pokemon
wishiwashi
Oddish, Durant, Magikarp, sunflora seeds. And I'm pretty sure the petlil leaves work like mint does irl as a bug repellent.
this is why Pal World is superior. it is front and open about eating the creatures.
Someone needs to introduce Mikey to the idea of Suckling Pig
on no,grunty boy has too much power,now he is unstoppable,well i can ask him about raycon the SPONSOR OF TODAY 'S VIDEO!! HHaah i cant control what im saying
Did you say vanillite and venilluxe
Pokemon trainers be like " I love Pokemon so much I want them to be a part of me."😁
Personally I’d be down to try some of the dragons-types. While we don’t know what a dragon based meat would taste like, I’d imagine it’d either be pretty tasty, or pretty hard to cook if its a dragon/fire type or something like that, thus making it really rare
Vanelish would be good
Combee and Vespiqueen makes honey.
I just realized that one of Miltank’s dex entry said that if you drink too much of its milk you’ll turn into a Miltank… Does this make Mikey a cannibal?
Anyone else disappointed he didnt say he would eat the sausage nipples?
"I would eat his mom, though." Is definitely going to be clipped out of context and memed... Edit Also BIG MEATY CLAWS!!!
Hi there I have a question I have question I have a shiny male Kirlia in legends arceus and I have a dawn stone so what should in evolve it into Galade or Gardivar
Tauros.  It's literally made to become some bum ass steak.
Skiddo/Gogoat, Octillery, Wartortle, etc should be tasty too
Magikarp would be delicious as well
NO Mikey exeggacute is literally called the egg Pokémon 😂
"I'll eat his mom though"  -same bro, same
Just how incredibly petty Mikey gets towards a fictional cow never ceases to amaze me. If Pokemon were real, I could easily imagine him trying to physically hurt a Miltank, only for it to effortlessly whoop his butt.
I miss this type of content
Slowpoke tails grow back
After 5 years we get THE REMAKE!! and not just the top ten this time!
Mikey likes shuckles juice
I want talonflame breast and pumpkin stew is great with steak. U cook it in the pumpkin
I would like to try shelmet or omanyte, they are both snail pokemon and I actually enjoy escargot so they also might taste good.
What about vanilla? It is just an ice cream
I did not finish watching the video yet, but you get an upvote for the sponsor segment :D
Can i say gardevior?
Jesus, how did I never realize EVERY crab either starts with a C or a K?
NOOO NOT ALCREAMIE ITS MY FAVORITE POKÉMON 😢
Magikarp Soup or Gyarados Soup 🤷‍♂️😏
Charazard and shinx
If you were to eat a fire type Pokémon product would it be naturally spicy or if you were to eat an exeggcute would you need to crack any of the seeds/eggs it’s made of
Yes, Malamari probably wouldn't do anything to you if you ate it, but it would be really, REALLY expensive. Have you thought about how hard it would be to kill? It's a Dark/Psychic type! It would mind control you in a heartbeat if it thought you could be dangerous! Even just chopping one arm off would be a huge task! Also it's cool so don't eat it
i want raycon headphones but sadly i live in brazil and they don't sell there i could buy on amazon BUT GOD DANM THEY'RE EXPENSIVE MORE THAN 700 BRD JUST THE EARBUDS
I’d say the skin on Appleton’s back counts as pastry.
Why do you put the Mirror B battle theme in every video? It gets really annoying
I think Mikey would enjoy some Drowzee if you know what I mean...
Grunty Boi hasn't touched grass.          Soon we'll witness the 'passing' of Grunty Dad.
Hey mandJ tv what would you say if I told you I found a shiny onix in the Wondering cave in Pokemon Y and I ran from it i should have caught it maybe I'll look for it but I don't have the shiny charm since I started over on it
i love how grunty boi is now canonically a psychic type
Some miltank burgers with a side of Combusken wings  with some Buffalo sauce.
I would be down to eat a marripe or some edkans mabe some magic Carpe
Grunty Boi is a pro gamer yay
Wait is appiltan is not a meat it’s skin and meat are a fruit
o_o ...I think Grunty Boy might been eating bit too much Slowpoke Tails, he has started to develop psychic powers.  Also, not going to give rabbit a go? Bunelby could be decent, though Diggersby might be too sinewy. ...Also not touching Buneary and Lopunny. ...Or Cinderace line.
Goes to the TRF Twice.   Well.
Isn't this the second time you do this video?
Pokemon are friends, NOT FOOD! We love Grunty Boi, and doubt he would eat Pokemon Friends. I would consider trying Shuckle Berry Wine and would drink Miltank Milk as for the Petalil Leaves if they dropped off naturally then would drink that tea. As for the Tropius Fruit same thing as long as dropped naturally/was offered by it. Same for those snowy Pokemon berries. That seance thing about Pumpkin Pokemon then ok as well.
4:06 Subtitles: HSI Grand tip boy.
Crabby's meat would be sweeter than other crabs
Zebstrika would be good it’s like a tougher gator meat with natural spice
We actually eat some fruits that produce natural bug repellent like oranges so that’s not that Farfetch’d
Grunty Boi needs to touch some grass
Fr Mickey sounded like me 10:30 I love pumpkin stuff too
miltank milk tastes better when it’s ethically questionably sourced
Lopunny’s as- body… I mean we can eat rabbits and hares
EXEGGUTE IS NOT A SEED
Every pokemon youtuber I'd eat :
no doduo or dodrio? it's a big nugget
0:19 HOLD UP WHAT Purplecliife?
You forgot the ice creams boys
You missed lopunny, do it in front of purplcliffe. But in all seriousness, Ditto.
Kinda disturbing.
Great, Now I'm starving!
The Bambee line was so cold, I love it
Mikey: I'm not gonna eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom,. though. Me: Stop it. Get some help. Also, SPOILERS, DUDE!!!!
you would die if you eat barraskewda because of toxin accumulation in the fishso maybe just stick to arrocuda
I see you with the Austin FC shirt. Personally i am from NY and an NYCFC fan but good looks
next time ever pokemon i would marry rolf
I would eat bruxish just so it suffers
Surprised you didn't mention magikarp
“How is Malamar gonna mind control me if it’s dead?” Here’s the neat thing. You mind control other people.
What about the literal ice cream Pokémon? I’d be down to eat a Vanillite.
But michael, you can cook  the bolivian plate of food "Lechon" using the pokemon "Lechong" :v
He from texas isn t he big meet eater
but vanillite is technically ice cream
Sckuymlabls
I would say Marshadow, but Pokémon Talk covered why Marshadow is not food. BRING POKÉMON TALK BACK TO YOUTUBE.
So if you were to get gmax alcreamie, could you still eat it and what would that taste like.
I remember the universally hated elemental monkeys are great for making tea in the Pokémon world (or in the manga). Pansage's leaf combine with Panpour's water, and boiled with Pansear's fire or something like that.
Love your content Mikey please follow my Instagram I also got a mytey Plush hail form
12:55 I'm laughing at your accent
Grunty boi is a mythical gamer god!?!
This was a fun video. Although less common a topic as many things in Pokémon, it is undeniable that many could be fair to eat. Some more than others. Would probably settle on Alcremie being my favourite in these regards. Pretty good on its own, but can surely enhance other meals as well.
So in the Pokémon world one has to perform an exorcism in order to have pumpkin pie.
Jaiden named her Blaziken kn her first Nuzlocke teriyaki LMAO
Magikarp??
Poor Mikey doesn’t understand that the younger the deer the better the meat tastes. Eat the Deerling!
POV An 11-year-old laughed like a madman when he said 3:56 and its demise
He forgot Fidough
Emboars insides are probably really warm cuz it's a fire type or smth
i remember an old version of this video. the nostalgia
Had a kangaroo burger, it was pretty good.
never knew i needed piloswine bacon till today..
Mikey talking about being a pokemon cannibal for 15 mins strait
I don't know how any pokemon could possibly be near extinct when Dittos and Daycares exist. I must have completely destroyed Galar's ecosystem by releasing non-shinies all on my own.
Gruntyboi and me have something in common! Staying inside for so long we forget what color grass is. (don't worry i know its red)
So something interesting about Appletun is that it’s stated that children USED to peel the skin off of its back and eat it.  This implies that ripping off Appletun’s crust causes it pain and or the crust does not grow back and likely would be left behind after being harvested for sweet snack material.  We can assume this was later made illegal by the Government.
No fidough
I love it how Mikey forgot to add the three literal ice cream Pokémon 🤣
Ah yes the video that no one can do without sounding weird... Even Mikey. May I présent you the best ones I've caught:  0:45 The tails have been described has pleasant to chew on or flavourful.  2:01 Another product I would try is Shuckle's juice !  3:57 I suppose I would drink his milk too, I'm sure it's quite good.
Maybe magikarp would be tasty
Someone else appreciates pumpkins as much as I do
You really should try lechon..
What about Combee's honey?
grunty boi clearly has a good gaming chair and headphones
Dang man you are dark
MIKEY! WATCH OUT! THE VEGANS ARE COMING!
I love Eel meat in a thick soy sauce, bbq'ed and served in a bowl of rice with some pickled vegetables on top. Perfect meal. Unagi is amazing
Vanillite
I bet pumpkaboo pumpkin cookies would be amazing
Don’t worry. The reason Team Rocket doing it was bad was how they were going about it. That was illegal.
You might not eat lechonk but i feel like it's evolution is where Paldea gets its ham from
Hellow
Mike are you gonna play vio.let or arlet
Today I learned mikey spends every minute not on camera at Starbucks ordering pumpkin spice latte's.  They probably know him by name
fish is my favorite food
But what about Fidough?
Vanillish/Vanillite, Mantine and Octillery missing (in my opinion)
mark
Vanillux
pumpkin pie is amazing
"Ill eat his mom tho" is the best and worst thing I've ever heard Mikey say!!!
Hear me out: virizion. It is sort of like a deer, and it big, so you'd get lot's of meat from it. Maybe some Chansey egg, leak, and some shuckle juice, and it could make a pretty decent soup
Venison is good in spaghetti also I’d only eat the poke meat that won’t hurt pokemon supplying so definitely slowpoke tail
just putting this out there, i dont think fire pokemon would cook very well
I bet you could consume Fidough - use it with Pumkaboo to make your pumpkin pie! LOL
You could bake fidough, and since wiglett might be a clam, if that gets confirmed then that would sound good
I'm surprised he didn't mention vanilluxe or its line
Me when he said shuckles juice 🤨🤨🤨😳😦
Get a militank steak, farfetch’d leek, pumkaboo pie, and some schuckle juice and boom.
You think Sawsbuck would taste different for each of its seasonal forms? Heh, seasoning.
Uh  grunty boi  you need to touch grass :0
Tepite seems like a nice spicy snack for some beef jerky while on a road trip
wtf lol evil
Mikey if you want Slowpoketail why didn't you ask Grundy boi I'm sure he can sneak away 1
I’m surprised he didn’t mention Vanillite. Also love the video! The miltank and piloswine parts haha
14:13 thank you    its seeds not eggs
Gogoat milk
Uhh... how did you forget the Vanilluxe line?
You missed the fish pokemon Magikarp and feebass
"I'll eat his mom tho" Ayo???
Wiglett.... whole
Mans talked about dessert pokemon and didn't even mention the most controversial pokemon of gen 5 - the Vanillite line!
Escargot and frog legs, miachel?
But what about other foods from Pokémon like combee honey
You forgot the ice cream cone Pokemon!
Thought for sure Vanillish would be on here. But maybe Mikey’s not a ice cream man?
If you’d be willing there are some bugs that people eat that we have Pokémon based on that YIU ciykd theoretically eat
PUMPKIN SPICE!!! Also as for Appleton I figure it's kind of like a lizard and they shed their skin. So I guess it would be that you eat the skin that is actively shedding so it's not doing any harm to the Pokémon.
“I won’t eat Bambi I’ll eat his mom though” Mikey what are you trying to imply
Today was the day John was betrayed
If you hunt unpheasant, only hunt the female ones. Their design sucks. Also, Milkery milk sounds delicious.
"not Bambi, I wouldn't eat Bambi, I would eat his mom tho" I'm not sure you will eat her or "eat" her....
Appleton skin is probably closer to bread than plant since it seemingly is pie crust
Some fried articuno
There's some great quotes in here
Yeah I can't eat most of those. The reason? I'm Jewish.
Wtf kind of video is this??? Mike might be running out of ideas
Snorlax
Okay Mikey challenge accepted Pumpkin Spice Beer. Yes this also does exist.
This is sick
You are breaking one of the commandments of poke-Moses incessant is my favourite pokemon
,, Not Deerling tho. I'm not eating Bambi. I would eat his mom tho. "                                                   /Michael/
I would eat yveltal
Fun fact caffine is a natrual insect killer (english isn't my first language and I'm too lazy to google the correct word)  So basically we drink a bitter liquid because the stuff that was originally meant to kill insects keeps us awake
Togepi! Boil ‘em, mash ‘em, cook a nice soufflé…
Octillery would probably make good calamari too!
What about vanillice? Isn't it ice cream?
Have smolive oil with miltank
I don’t jbiw giw well it would FI dish with frog man aka John but maybe guy ciykd eat some idbfge drugs he likes a vur less than ur hers that are axdyally drugs and BIR tadpoles
gardevoir
This is the sequel I’ve been looking forward to the most out of all sequels
2:23 yeah, apparently Shuckle is inspired by snake wine. I'll pass on that.
I think Petlil's leaves are more coffee than tea, considering coffee plants grow coffee beans as an indecticide to repel bugs and how coffee is also bitter.
Imma try a pumpkin cheesecake 1 day
Grunty boy becoming a magical gamer is honestly just a perfectly natural progression for him
Tauros seems to be mostly muscle with how fkn hard it hits
Mikey, you should try jacksepticeye s coffee, I'd watch that ad/review XD all of your ads are so fun with grunty Boiii
Grunty Boi is canonically more powerful than Arceus
But it is the egg pokemon that’s what is says
I like mushrooms 2 MandJTV
what about fidough
Pidgeons are supposed to be tasty... and Pidgey's an early route bird so...  Horse meat too is supposed to be delicious... Rabbits are also eaten...  Then there's the infamous sharkfin soup (Sharpedo, Gible, Gabite, Garchomp) and equally infamous turtle soup...
honey?by beedrill?
Grunty boy getting sponsored by Sawcon headphones.
YOU FORGOT THE ICE CREAM
"Another pokemon product I would try is shuckles juice" There once was a time where people and pokemon w-
What about tentacool and tentacruel?
Yaaaaay
So like you remade the video from the last few years before ultra sun and ultra moon
You don't wanna try Fidoh?
Thank Arceus you didn't name every pokemon you would fu-
A quick note about the "eating bug repellent plants"; there are actually a number of fragrant herbs commonly used in cooking which are known to have repellant effects on some species of bugs. Rosmary, mint, and basil are all noted as having some level of effectiveness repelling mosquitoes, for example.
I’m pretty sure assuming they’re the edible type of cactus tiy ciykd maybe try eating Maractus or Cacturne Also assuming YIU like cactus ur would be willing to try it
I can think of several you missed. First is the vanililuxe line since it's just ice cream. Surksit syrup always sounded like it could be good on pancakes/waffles. For poultry and eggs I would include Dudou/Dodrio since ostrich eggs and emu meat are a thing same goes for Pidove because people eat doves and Tranquail eggs both to further decrease the Unfezant population and because quail eggs are a thing . Sharpedo's dorsal fin used to be a delicacy and as someone who likes octupus rings I'd also try to octillery rings
No not pil
So basically it's a lilliance or whatever makes tea that taste like hot garbage but will be like super caffeinated and give you a boost to go all day kind of thing yeah you need some sort of honey from one of those bee Pokemon for that some shellfish Pokemon might be good too since we're talking about Pokemon that it would be good to eat yeah anything in the shellfish category I think would go over very well I personally would be behind eating anything based on a shrimp lobster or crab not so much anything that's a buy valve cuz I don't like stuff like clam and I doubt I would like anything along the lines of oysters or muscles or whatever
Wait if you help make the pokedex does that mean your player character tries the pokemon and eats it
What no ice cream Pokemon? lol
If it is delicious why would you not breed farfetch'd so it shouldn't be nearly extinct
I would Like to eat Vaporeon😋
Caffeine is an insecticide so I think petaline is literally just a sentient tea tree   Though I think I would need a ranch to keep up with the consumption
It is basically real food except for sweat
If you want to eat a miltank your weak. I'd eat a jinx, snorlax or arceus
Lechonk might not be that big but it is said he is PACKED with muscle so alot of meat for his size and he literally named after a food Also smoliv is just an olive so put it on pizza
Chikorita could be quite scrumptious and maybe bruxish as well try to diminish that population. In some countries that eat bats do with that as you would, horse meat isn’t half bad, why not throw some dog in there as well try to emulsify different cultures. Oh and the vanillish line it’s literally ice cream, they make cactus into food so there’s maractus and cacnea. In the south there make alligator meat, and don’t forget frog legs. I could go on and on but I’ll stop there
I'll just eat Alcremie with cherubi on top
Morelull and Shiinotic would make you high or smth. Just look at them
Did he really forgot the literal Ice Cream Pokemon?
Hey Mikey, great video! I was wondering if you've seen BDG's Pokemon Edibility video. I feel like you might enjoy it!
I would personally eat machamp
Had to swipe up them new Raycons real quick
The "multi Bee vitamin" joke had me rolling. It was the joke I didn't know I needed but glad it was!
I remember in the original anime Ash was at an aquarium with regular fish and says, "Wonder what kind of Pokémon these are?" So I often wonder if there isn't regular animals mixed in among the Pokémon.
Why’s this video making me hungry
So do you think Girafarig and Farigiraf are somehow related, eg: one evolves into the other or is it similar to Luvdisk and Alolamola?  Never Mind, I found the answer ;)
You will start to look like one
Apparently Mikey doesnt like ice cream
Pumpkin ramen
i too think grass is blue
Ice cream
if you eat dialga meat....... you can control time?
I have a feeling that Pumpkaboo would embue the pumpkin with some sort of spiritual essence that would make it taste better/ different
Rule 34 artists: "We came as soon as we heard!!!"
Yeah it's bird that equals poultry it's definitely something that counts but I got to say a bird of that description wouldn't be considered white meat I think that would be like red meat kind of like an ostrich or something for that matter what about their Duo and dodrio would you eat them there's something along the lines of an ostrich and ostrich burgers a thing but by the way I'm playing Pokemon go while watching this video shrunk on my phone and I just hatched a freaking miltank so you feel like some burgers
I would look my blaziken in the eye as I ate another blaziken, to remind it what's going to happen if it faints in battle.
Cod phish and Crawdaunt were excluded because they aren’t crabs or lobsters  Tgeyre crawfish
👀👁️👁️
Now I'm hungry
There's an episode where a dude makes some liquids out of shuckles and berries Not sure if it was juice or medicine tho; it was in Johto btw
It's not that odd that Pokemon have a close bond with Humans and are eaten. After all, its the same with Real World Animals.
3:56 Mikey you fool, don't you know if you drink to much miltanks milk you will turn into miltank. (also yes this is a real pokedex entry)
Mikey would rather eat a living creatures sweat instead of lamb, good to know.
no the grass is actually purple and the dirt is blue
The shuckle was an episode in the anime, they even showed a shiny that had a better flavor than the rest.
Swirlix is NOT cotton candy. It is a dog pokemon that only eats sweet treats and sweats out a sugary oil.
Idk man, Dragonite is looking fairly plump and in a world with dragons who doesn't want to at least be able to say you've eaten dragon??
The ice creams, you missed them!
Hoothoot
I would eat Gardevoir
3:20 Put that sentence out of context lmao.
Dude. This is my friend's personal evil team. People who want to eat pokemon.
Grunty-boy needs to touch some grass
Mikey just needs an exorcist and he'll have the time of his life with his pumpkins
Don’t you feel bad that you take chansey and blissey’s egg and they feel bad about there egg
Perhaps if Pokémon were real, one of the finest delicacy’s would be wooloo lamb with some boundsweet wine
You need to get  another sponsor that deals without side so grunty boi can watch Mikey touch grass
As a Hindu I can say, my religion does not allow me to consume beef and pork No miltank steaks for me
Dubwool looks really tasty
I would question which of shukles “bodily fluids” are used as that could get conceptually disgusting   I ain’t drinking it’s piss
12:42 does he know about vanilla or baking soda guys
Why isn‘t Vanilluxe included? It‘s literally an ice corn and its name suggests, that it taste like vanilla.
You missed pikachu....
I wanna eat a gyrados
"I've decided to add Pro Gramer to my resume" Be careful out there, Grunty Boi. You're a VERY PG character entering a world where the ratings are often ignored.
if you eat inkay/malamar, why not octillery?
I’m pretty sure Bounsweet is based in a mangostine although I’ve never had itmangistine befire
"I'm not gonna eat Bambi. I'll eat his mom though" That sounds so sus without context lol
what about vanilluxe?
I once tasted pumpkin and it had no taste. In Finland, we don't usually use spices, so I could have thought that pumpkin tastes like something. So my own pumpkin experience was disappointing.
Klefki. Next question
☹😮youd eat ???????
Some weird meats I’ve tried that were actually pretty good include goat, ostrich, and alligator tail. On top of enjoying lamb and mutton (so I’d throw in Marreep, Wooloo and Dubwool), I’d also include Gogoat, Doduo/Dodrio, Croconaw/Feraligator, and Krokorok/Krookodile
what about the vanillite line?? they're straight up ice cream. also the appletund one could be a "pastry" since it is inspired by apple pie so maybe kids used to eat them but it leaves the pokemon's back very sensitive and soft causing the pokemon to be vulnerable. also why not magikarp? it could be a good sashimi/ sushi. shark meat is also good alot of cartilage but tastes like chicken. and finally nice concept and amazing video thank you :)
Getting Snover's barries is probably a task easier said then done, considering that Abomosnow typically are extremely protective over Snover. Not to meantion Sword's dex entries for Abomosnow talks all about how when Galarian Darumaka try to steal Snover' berries, they typically chase them away, swinging its arms like hammers.
Surprised no combee or vespequin honey. Become a combee keeper, keep the vespequin happy, and boom! You get honey from your bee friends
Vannilux Or that evo line?
Milcery has the word sorcery in it si you wouldn’t want to eat that and alcremy has the word alchemy in it so you wouldn’t want to eat that either
The vegan teacher won’t be very happy about this video. Especially the miltank part.
“I wouldn’t eat Bambi, I’d eat it’s mother though.” This is what he meant by morally grey.
vanillish: am i a joke to you
To someone that grown up on a farm we raised our animals with care and love as our pets but in the end we ate them, so Pokemon concept of eating pokemon isn't weird or anything else it actually seems normal
This is what we waited for?
THE PUNS
Not to mention we do the exact same thing, we have animals as pets and some of them we eat and have the same animals as pets xD
Vanilish?
So, you hate Miltank so much you want it inside you? 😂
Mikey did you legitimately say this is going to get playfully morally Gray I mean I feel like certain Pokemon like the fish yeah sure even farm animals but if you go beyond that I think you're getting into a only if you were starving to death type situation they are friend not food
Yes Grunty Boy, grass is blue
Did He forgot about Drowzee ?
Well this must be a pokemon video gordon fooking ramsay would like to know
Beef and pumpkin stew
Do you think Combuskin drumsticks would come pre-spicy?
GRUNTY GAMER BOI!!!!!!
what about pawmi and smolive?
Grunty boy He is an all powerful being
I want to eat wiglett
Gardevior
3:23 😭
The honey of combee and vespiqueen also looks bomb to me. And dont know if you would count it, but the olive on smoliv.  P.s. Not a pokemon but the berries that drampa gives in the anime also look amazing
How dare thee not honor thy fidough. Thee hath't been condemned from the community for thy ignorance of culinary delights of the Pokémon ordinary.  Judgment passed by PM7 the third.
The bug repell from the petilil leafs is most likely caffeine so it would be like a mate tea. I think that is a nice little detail there.
1.Seedot-the only nut 2. Smolive- oil 3. Squritle/warturtle/chewtle/dreadnaw- turtle meat and pretty sure unlike in this world there not endangered in pokemon 4.Wailmer/Wailord-same as above pretty sure there not endangered and would interested to try 5. Maractus- only if it had fruit similar to prickly pear on it 6. Kiddo/Gogoat-goat meat great for stews or real Greek gryos  7. Ekans/Arbok/Seviper/Serperior-snake meat is actually very good... just don't overcook it 8. Skwovet/Greedent- squirrel is a light meat that is perfect for pot pies 9.Bidoof/Bibarel- Since they aren't shown to be threatened or endangered I here from a native friend of mine beaver meat is heavy kinda greasy meat that goes great in stew or fried with juniper berries and pine nuts on wild rice and would try it. 10.Urasring/Beartic- never had bear meat would like to try at least once 11.Seel/Dewgong/Walrein-Seal and walrus meat were very popular in past and wouldn't mind trying since like other pikemon these don't seem to be endangered  12. Sharpedo- fin soup (never had) and shark steak (have had) and there are everywhere at least in galar  13. Rapidash- horse meat has been a human staple for centuries and only recently in the past like 50 years has really been banned wouldn't mind trying it at least once 14. Miltank- ik you stated it the video but I would try the udder, idk if it's true or not but read that cow udder is delicacy in France and has a light buttery taste to it. Any French people pls confirm or deny this.
Shouldn't have watched this when I was hungry but great video as always
I remember that u did this video before
Give me the pigs  I like ribs I’d types of pork  Ribs are my facieure food and I like a kid I’d ifger prk related foods
Good lord this video got weird fast.
Another unusual but not terribly uncommon meat is bear! I can see Ursaring (and by extension Ursaluna) being quite tasty exotic meat. I've had bear meat myself and found it to be absolutely delicious, quite comparable to beef, but much more dense and I could only handle a small amount at one sitting. Only caveat to that is that you need to make sure you cook it thoroughly, lest you get trichinosis.  Side note, would trichinosis even exist in the Pokemon universe? Who knows. Better cook it to a thorough 160 degrees just to be sure.
Shuccel had the first ever ability  In gen 2 there was a 1/16 chance for after a battle shuccel made berry juice if it was holding an uneaten berry
What about basculegion or white striped basculin?
How about blipbug? Looks crunchy
Imagine not eating arceus
I think you are running out of ideas
I just finished a steak and i see the thumbnail
With 5 of the like 15 pokemon revealed for SV being foods, and more definitely coming as one of the three main campaigns is about cooking, I wonder why you didn't wait a month to make this video...
I'd eat a snorlax. Its basically a bear. A bear that just eats and sleeps so that meat has GOT to be super tender
"cough" vanilluxe?
Fidough should’ve been on there imo
Veggies are not in the food theory episode because want to be vegan or vegetarian eat real flowers and fruit
Fighdough looks like a sweet pastry
Slowpoke tail bubblegum!
I’m going to eat some delicious kinglers today
I would want to try a rare candy and a Vinnilite
"I won't eat Bambi... I'll eat his mom tho." taking that out of contest...
Now I'm questioning the ham that they previewed in the scarlet and violet trailer when showing off sandwiches.  Also since we know pokemon eat other pokemon I wonder if predation is common during some Pokémon battles?
Not gonna lie, I would DEFINITELY eat Pokémon. They sound delicious. Maybe I’d eat a fish Pokémon.
What about the bread dog fidough
Youtube really wanted me to watch this It was like the top in all my recommendations like let me go through my subs tab first
you cuz u bee looking like a snack
Wouldn't Blaziken just be super well done chicken?
It would be funny I if you put a huge dramatic drum role before "Grun-Tee-Boi". Just imagine: "It is I....................................................................................................... GRUNTY BOY!"
hmmm how about a gator chili from Feraligatr / Croconaw?  AND WHAT ABOUT SMOLIV 🥲🥲🥲  also wishing that the Vanillite line is more ice-cream like, instead of snow 😂
Thanks for the survival guide 😂
Eat all the Grumpigs you can please. That Pokemon is so ugly I can only imagine it as bacon for it to look good.
Should do a video on you living as a pokemon in a generation of your choice and how you'd be like either with a trainer or living on your own.
(Insert cow Pokémon here I would eat all of them as a medium rare boneless ribeye)
slowpoke tails are morally fine if you keep them on a nice ranch and when the tails fall off pick em up
Guess we need to breed and release more Farfetch'd into the wild to save it from extinction, just like the Lapras guy before.
Watching this after I haven’t eaten anything today. Thanks in advance for getting me hungrier Michael.
M..m..m..milltank😂 ha millfat
What about Fidough?? It's a bread dog!!
Or in this case "gotta eat them all" heh,nailed it
That's really weird
What about Fidough?
I would decently try dragon or dinosaur meat. Serve me up some medium rare Salamance please.
Fermentation end product could be alcohol or vinegar.
3:20… what
Would vegans/vegetarians in the Pokémon world be allowed to eat grass types?
7:42 not that weird honestly, for example orange peels can also be used as bug repellent in the real world.
Hear me out: I would try some of the snake, rabbit, horse, and squirrel Pokémon. They’re on my bucket list of foods to try, anyway. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Eat Diglett. All you need is a shovel and a hot dog bun
7:41 peppermint oil is used as a bug repellent but we can eat peppermint 🤷🏾‍♀️
Mikey has gone insane
I have friends in boston and I can confidently say that's not the accent LOL I do appreciate the effort though it made me laugh
But i mean, how different is it than us now? How many farm kids get attached to the animals they know are gonna be food later??
What about vanilice
3:45 ... same, though as ground beef version
Malarmar: you will serve me now, wait Micheal what are you doing... No No Noooo   Mikey: who whats malimary???😁
yummy yummy
you missed the bug types. kinda weird that you'll eat kangaroo but not bugs.
I feel like Feraligatr would also be tasty. Alligator is quite delicious.
He forgot that ice cream Pokemon bruh
Eat wiglett because why not
Die devel cow DIE
No one: Miltank: I am the milkman. My milk is delicious.
Surprised he aint into eating drowsies.... If you know, you know
I feel like sharpedo or carvanha could be tasty, shark is a delicate meat but quite tasty. Also goldeen and seaking would i feel be tasty and sorry PM7 but feesh(magikarp) has to be on the list
fidough
God i loved this episode (even for as unsettling it was at the beginning pf)  I’m wondering tho, you never mentioned vanillish/vanilluxe, which to be fair are just snow and ice made to look like ice cream, but i feel like if you flavoured them with juice or sugar they’d made nice snow cones perhaps
This is the happiest I have seen Michael on camera in a while. I have a feeling the food does that.
I think he likes Grapploct too much to eat it.
No Vanillite or Vanillish? Need something to go with Milktank streak
I feel like you'd end up cursed or haunted if you at the pumpkin pokemon.
Head-canon: Some Togepi eggs don't contain Togepi Appletun regrows it's apple pie back
Would you try pumpkin spice Ramen noodles? Last year my partner saw some at a Walmart so he got them, as he too loves all things pumpkin and pumpkin spice.
Oh Mikey, that’s not true, we all know Onix gets to go inside a willing Cloyster…
Fun fact: combustskien has been described in the dex entries that it will kill anyone who eats it
After all this time we know who killed Bambi’s mom 3:23
Gmax alcremie
Blub
I'll try vanilix in summer 🍦🍦🍧
Mikeyyyyyy
Sunkern would be an edible Pokémon. Sunflower seeds are edible, after all.
I feel like Tepig would still taste good even if there isn't that much meat on it as with Crabrawler. It could have a sort of smoky taste and who knows, maybe you wouldn't even have to cook it
“I’m not gonna eat Bambi I’ll eat his mom though!” Got me cracking up
You mispronounced Milcery. You said it like milkery when it’s supposed to be a combination of milk and sorcery
Pokemon: You're my best friend in a world we must defend!!!  Also Pokemon: If you don't want a Gyarados, turn your Magikarp into sashimi.  Also, because Alcremie is on the list I want to make this clear. I love Alcremie. She's one of my favorite Pokemon. I would kill anyone who tried to put her on hot chocolate or pumpkin pie.
Lechonk is like the perfect sized pig for consumption, Sunkern would probably taste like a giant sunflower seed, Wishiwashi is partially based on sardines, Feebas might be really tasty in spite of its appearance, Sirfetch'd is just a larger Farfetch'd with more veggies, Fidough could maybe be turned into a nice loaf of bread, Smoliv sounds like it could provide some good olive oil, Skiddo and Gogoat provide both goat meat and milk, Blipbug has that nice crunch to it, and Bidoof and Bibarel I just really want to eat
Unfezent fans. We have a new target.
What about scorbunny?  (raboot and cinderace are to human)
I watched this before I had eaten, which I now regret
Ill watch this later today when I have time but I just know youre gonna love the taste of Miltank Sausage Nipple Sausages
OMG the title had me laughing so hard 😂
I feel like an argument could be made to eat Fidough
Bro you didn't have to eat The Pokémon version of Bambi's mom
Fun fact Miltank Is classified as a fairy not a cow so technically you’re actually eating a magical creature lol also I’d probably eat castform Since it’s a water molecule I’d be water fasting lol
Clam chowdaaaah?
I'd imagine things like Faux meat a day animal products (Like leather) would be massively popular in the Pokemon world. Also, if a Pokemon dies of natural causes that isn't something like disease, I'd say that's far more morally fine to eat.
3:20 🤨
8:41 I feel like Appletun SHEDS it's skin so people can eat it... Makes more sense and is more humane
no grunty boy is wrong grass is red
Why not eat a rare candy? I believe shuckle turns that juice to rare candies after a time.
Amazing
Idk if this was just me, but at the battle maison in Pokemon Omega ruby I swear I used to see a swinub on a plate💀
So it seems that magikarp will be saved... For today atleast...
I beat like half of sword and shield with just Grookey and Unfeazant lol
YAY new video and updated video :D I love this channel
If you’re eaten a deer might as well eat xerneas or is it a reindeer?
Off the top of my head ludicolo seems like it'd be edible. I mean pineapple roasted duck? Just prune the lily pad off I'll try it
Bro you know this is gonna trigger the TikTok vegans lol
I would be down for some Kingler sushi
apple ton is a apple pie
I would absolutely eat a Krabby and Clawitzer some butter and seasoning would be delicious
I think hipapowdon and would be tasty
The vegan teacher be like 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I'm allergic to shellfish
Gardevior
Nice Re-Make for a Nice but Old video
3:23  Mikey:I wont Eat Bambi. Il Eat His Mom Tho Me:Ayyyyoooo lmao
Here me out       Wooloo
Now that you are ready to eat Pokemon, Grunty boi can play Pokemon FireRed Team Rocket Edition much easier
Also maybe Fidough
this is one of Mikey's most unhinged videos yet. and i'm here for it
I can't believe you missed Fidough! He's just a bready boi!
Wow. Mike post at 7
I am living for this slightly dark morally gray Mikey. Thank you for giving us what we didn't know we needed
3:23 is so out of context it cut out
A frosty and creamy vanilluxe will be nice to eat
who here remembers mikey's original "Pokemon I would eat" video that he made years n years ago?
Fidough
gory teams for events to you as well
Someone pls clip 3:22 out of context, lol.
Grunty is wizard confirmed
Deer meat is so good I hate to say it but the deerling is really tender like a regular fawn but deer meat better for you then beef so a decent deer feed a family for weeks
I need an edit of the scene in bambi where his mom dies, except right after we just hear, “greeting poke fans, Michael here.”
"I'm not gonna be Bambi, I'll eat his mom though" ...Hold up
Hi Mikey I've subbed and I have turnned on notifacations
Magikarp? 👀
Fidough would be amazing
Now I can imagine Mikey eating the pumpkin of a pumpaboo and then taking flight
I always thought that in the Pokemon world there is no need to eat Pokemon because the technology is so advanced that they eat synthetic meats, so that means all the meat in game is not real meat.
3:22 Editor, another sus clip right here!
Glad to have another one of these the first one was so nostalgic to me
would you eat fidough ?
I have a Teipig plush I named Bacon
Pumkaboo is actually eaten in atleast in pokemon Cafe remix
magikarp
You seem to have forgotten the Vanillish line.
Crocodile meat is really good, so I would be in for a krokorok dish
What about fidough?
I don't see a reason why it's weird to drink petilel leaves because it a bug repellent effect, we drink coffee which is a natural form of bug repellent, the Buzz we get from coffee is used to kill the bugs that try to eat it.  It's weird how we humans like to eat and drink what's normally poisonous, snake venom sure just take away that super nasty stuff and make sure you don't have any cuts in ya, fruit that makes any creature with taste buds feel like their burning yeah how about we also make that a million times worse by eating genetically engineered ones, or how about a good sip of that fatigue reducing, bug killing grounded bean mixed into water
eggs are just chicken seeds though
I can’t believe you’d eat Miltank! Only a heathen would devour the greatest Pokémon
this kinda gives off that feeling when you wanna eatbpokemon
Sawsbuck antler sap would make great syrup imo
He missed vaniluxe and vanilice
THERES A LITERAL ICE CREAM POKÉMON
Honestly I could see myself eating most if not all these Pokémon too, especially the crab meats in the arms because the dex always says how the grow back easily, you have so many options with them with Kingler, Crabrawler, Clauncher, and Klawf. And in real life Crab meat with butter is so damn good.
Its kind of Funny how he forgot about FiDough
"I'll eat his Mom tho"
Can i make a youtube video of your content when i get older Mandjtv
Eat Mor Torchickin  And yes, I did actually put this on our  CFA sign when the spicy grilled returned this year 😂
I once made a tier list of how good every Pokemon would taste with tiers of "Basically cannibalism" for stuff like Machoke or Jynx or Conkeldurr, and a tier called "Inedible" for stuff like Gastly or Grimer or Geodude. You bet Farfetch'd, Magikarp and Alcremie were top tier.
BUT DONT EAT KANGAROOS
This is honestly one of the best videos you’ve made bro. Amazing job!
Drink castform
I love your vids
Mikey I’m from nz but have lived in Australia most of my life…. Kangaroo meat doesn’t get any better no matter how it cooked
Sorry to pm7  for this but what about Politoed legs? Frog legs are delicious so why not big frog legs
Grumpig and Shiinotic will make you trip BALLS
3:21 Out for Context is hella cursed
Ahh yes shuckles body fluids
you forgot about drowzee
I've had a crocidile burger in the past and it was pretty good so Krokorok makes the cut for me, I've also enjoyed cactus beer before and I feel like Maractus would be the best choice due to not having anything to do with the dark type and it's Shield entry stating "Once each year, this Pokémon scatters its seeds. They're jam-packed with nutrients, making them a precious food source out in the desert." I don't fully understand how the cactus beer was made but if it's seeds are that nutritious then I'm willing to give Maractus beer a try as well.
He made a Boston accent oml. That was amazing-
Ah yes, Eating miltank, Just gotta grill those sausage nips in some butter and you're good to go.
Shuckle juice could also be a more Cyder style drink.
Pokemon and human relationships are....weird. We eat them, but they are also fully sapient with emotions and understanding as complex as ours. And then there is the "marrying" them thing, which they REFUSE to retcon and also, iirc there was a part in the Alola games where some girls were openly hitting on a Machamp (who was actually a guy in a suit but they EXPLICITLY did not know that!!) coupled with moving Gardevior and her line to the humanlike egg group after years of them being solely Amorphous is pretty sus.
Imagine ThatVeganTeacher sees you eat a Miltank and tries to cancel you
What about Gigantimax Alcremie? Its just cake a really big technically sentient cake
This is my favorite Tedtalk
vaniluxxe line
bro the way Mikey said "Plus I hate it" with that smile was so funny
peta get him
Well, petilil’s leaves can grow back, so as long as she is fine with it, im fine with you having that tea
Grunty boi it's pink duh
If slowpoke tails fall off easily that makes them lizards instead of some sort of pigbearcat and I'm not sure I can handle that knowledge.
Can i have two milktanks please
You forgot the vanillite line! It’s just ice cream!
Appletun is apple pie so i think its more a pastry
and with that, Grunty Boy never touched grass again. He had a fight with Giovanni that day because Giovanni was complaining how fat he was getting and should focus more on getting money. His lasts word are "Watch me do a 360 no scope on your Mewtwo boss."
I think Sunkern would be a good choice. Many people love sunflower seeds!
I agree 100% with you on pumpkabu and gorghist I LOVE pumpkin food and I hate that they only sell it during fall, we should start to Rebell and make them serve it all year-round!
What about the ice creams? Vanillish, Vanillite, and Vanilluxe? They look tasty
I'd rather eat a younger deer than a fully grown one. Finer taste and not so tough. Also pheasant meat is so dry. It is a wild bird so it has very little fat and is tough due to a lot of movement. Pumpkin is also very enjoyable with savory foods, look at it as a vegetable like a sweet potato, nice savory/salty pumpkin soup is *amazing.* Oysters that are making pearls are better left uneaten, so ill skip Clamperl. People eat anchovies and sardines too, i dont see a reason not to eat Tynamo.
... ... ...     eating pig/ham is haram
I'm still amused that ham is one of the toppings for the sandwiches in Scarlett and Violet 🤣
"I wouldn't eat Bamby, I'd eat his mom though" Mandjtv 2022
"If it's delicious then it's delicious" -Michael2022
There is something amazing about combusken legs and ranch sauce
I like to imagine one commenter asked Mikey "Hey are you a vegetarian?" and this is his answer lol
Alcremie’s gigantimax form is just a large cake, and it’s different forms give off different flavours.Sinistea is dangerous but Antique Polteageist has to trust it’s trainer and then it will allow it’s trainer to try it’s distinctive flavour and aroma, if conditions are met sure, otherwise nope too risky
Dont you dare you touch my boy snover.
But what about Fidough?
smash or pass miltank
So that wasn’t Grunty. We all agreed that was likely a Pokémon in disguise?  Possibly a Psychic or Ghost type.
Tbh, if pokémon are the step in for animals, then either everyone is supposed to be vegan, or eating pokémon is as normal as us eating meat.
You forgot to mention wooloo, dubwool, mareep and flaaffy the sheep pokemon
I feel like this whole video exists just to justify murdering miltank
7:41 well caffeine is also a bug repelent/killer and people love it, so i guess it's fine  Also the Pidgeons might be very tasty
Kinda feels weird that he never mentioned vnilluxe at all.
3:51 That's why i would add pikachu to my diet.
You forgot Fidough, the pup literally made of bread
The milk tank one got me good
14:25 I was today years old when I learned these Pokemon existed! 😨 I’m having one of those moments where you’re like, “what is the Pokemon world coming to?”  Side note: I’m glad this topic was covered. A little strange, sure, but worth it 👍
No Mikey don’t eat it’s balls
Applion would be fine it just take a while to regrow it’s skin
What if we burn tyrunt i want to try eat trex meat :)
@MandJTV Stay away from my Piloswine!!!
Not Fidough?
now i want to see those Pokémon cooking videos with ACTUAL (Pokémon) FOOD, not bulbasaur, squirtle, chicorita or things like that...
Birdd
Not fidough?
This is a great video
The cries of clauncher and crawitzer has always made me want to eat them. Their cries scream tasty lobster.😋
I for one would love to buy Pokémon branded meats at the local supermarket, while unlikely, they’re skipping on billions of dollars not selling Pokémon themed foods uwu
Edible bugs, anyone?
At the end when he mentions Pokémon that are literal foods, I was surprised he didn't mention Vanilish and it's evolutions. It's just ice cream.
Can you do a flying types then versus now?
Another 3 legendary videos from 3 poketubers
i do also like me a three course meal in the pokemon world
Love this, thank you.
But like gigantamax alcreamie tho…
0:19 Recall that steppe cultures like Mongols, Scythians, and Comanche regularly rode horses and ate them too. So I think the dilemma of eating Pokémon is not an issue.
Possible Options:   Octillery Sharpedo Ursaring Fidough
i would eat gardevoir and lopunny
wheres fidough
I hate the flavor of pumpkin but love Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist. It'd be great 'mon for the team alongside Alcremie since I'm going on a very heavy diet and they probably don't like to be eaten, and would likely put up a massive fight.
Guess I'd have to go vegetarian if I lived in the Pokémon World.
Many of us would eat Vaporeon...
Mikey, what is this video lmao
Vanniluxe, Vannilish and Vannilite...
If Bouncsweet sweat is editable, then what about from a Tsareena? Anyone who finds this comment, I am ready for the 🤨📸.
As a Unova kid, I can confirm that mareep, once depleted of its energy and having its wool removed, can evolve into: a delicious dish
What about the gater meat? Gator met is also tasty.
Gamefreak: "Pokémon are your friends.., you must cherish them..." MandJTV: "I flambé them instead, if you don't mind..."
Did you miss the ICE CREAM?!
I think a really good tasting pokemon is a certain part of luponny not saying where
On the subject of Farfetch'd, I would catch one then catch a Ditto, let em do their thing and catch a few more Ditto. In no time I'd have a farm and a heap of restaurants reaching out to me for their menus 💵🤑
Shuckle sangria😂
The next smash or pass variant Eat or puke
A couple of additions to your poultry section, if I may. Hoothoot, Swanna, and Doduo/Dodrio. Hoothoot is a common, chonky bird and  Swanna would probably make a delicious swan roast. Dodio/dodrio are also fairly large birds reminiscent of the ostrich which can be pretty good.
I really want to know the story of how Mikey ended up eating Kangaroo meat.
Grungy Boy: Grass is Blue, Right?? Namekians: **nervous sweating**
As an Australian I can confirm that kangaroo meat isn’t that good, but crocodile is delicious!
Bison burgers are bomb af they serve those up north
Grunty Boi saying grass is blue is going to be amazing to the grunty lore
Mikey about to pull up to a miltank milk refinery and eat all of the miltank there.
how bout octilery
Oh, I almost forgot. The roserade tea you can get from the cafe in SM, USUM.
I would be so here for grunty boys memoires
I was pleasantly mortified by this video it was highly entertaining 😂
Mikey finally get revenge on Miltank😂 by eating it
man admitted that he is every other US white person during autumn
Excuse me what 0:19
well, i guess there is no need to eat pumpkaboo and gourgeist, since the dex entry implies that there are regular pumpkins in the pokemon world.
Finally, a video I'm somewhat early too. I whole heartily agree to this concept
As much as PM7 would hate it frog legs are a delicacy in some places so who is down for some greninja legs
I wonder how charmander tastes
What about hoot hoot It is the largest and heaviest bird so I must have a lot of meat on it But somehow it can fly
Hi Mikey!
The time has come. Mikey's lost it.
It makes me wonder if Pokemon recognize themselves as Pokemon or if they only recognize themselves as their particular species. If they see themselves as Pokemon and don't see humans as Pokemon (though can evolve into one), then they must be so confused on how people treat them.  Marry one, befriend another, then serve its siblings up for dinner.
You think Pokémon vegans exist?
don't eat grapoloct because it is fighting
I always assumed Appletun was similar to Slowpoke, in that the stripes on its back were shed naturally and that's what's being eaten. But then I double-checked and none of the dex entries claim that so IDK where I thought of that.  Also dangit I just ordered some Raycon earbuds; if I'd just waited a couple more days.  7:40 To be fair I think plants initially evolved caffeine to kill bugs that ate them so this makes perfect sense.
Michael they might put treeko/sceptile in Pokémon unite I know you don’t play but I’m just saying
I'm sure that Combee honey is edible, as well as Octillery Takoyaki.
fidough?
You could eat the leaves from Pansage's head, and similar to tropius, fruit from alolan exeggutor and trevenant who have harvest. Then there's sunkern and sunflora (maybe), remoraid, octillery (maybe), barboach, whiscash, the fruit that grows in the shrubs on grotle's back, honey from combee and other honey gatherers, tangrowth's vines, seeds from maractus, alomomola (apparently), Milk from milk drink users other than sausage nipples (like gogoat), and the food inside greedent's tail (maybe). That's just about everything.
I duuno if the variety of pumpkins you have in US taste different, but here in Brazil we have a lot of savory recipes with pumpkin - and it's delicious. I wouldn't eat a Pumkaboo, tho - poor guy
Name: Grunty boi Type: psychic normal Height: IDK 5-6ft? Weight: probably something absurd, considering we’re talking about Pokémon How to pronounce: grun-te-boy Known moves: attract, flamethrower, psybeam, hyperbeam, dark pulse, thunder bolt, focus blast, energy ball,
I can’t believe he didn’t say drowsey
Petilil being anti-bug makes sense when you remember why plants developed caffein
Alright, this episode is freaking hilarious. There were several points where I just burst out laughing (particularly with the extermination of Miltank). Excellent work, Mikey.
If you could have 6 Pokémon in real life, plus one legendary in real life, what would it be?
Shuckle the juicer pokemon.
Y’know what? I’m just okay with berries!
I hate to break it to you pal but crabominable is based off of the coconut crab which meat is not safe to eat.
9:21 Out of context
I think Tynamo will be like anchovies. I'd try them fried and served with tomatoes. Yum.
You forgot dessert!! Vanillite
Prior watching this: YES! Death to Miltank! Post watching this: How could you do this to John?
Tmi. TMI. TMI! TMI!
what about magikarp?
I feel like you could've included Qwilfish here. Once the poison is extracted, I feel like it would be no different that real fugu.
Michael inviting Pm7 for some Pe-TEA-lil
Hey nice vidoe but quick question when are u dping Pokémon talk it’s a good series bring it back [:
Gardevoir would be a tasty snack
You missed Castform off the list... hear me out, it's a water molecule, if you got a lot of them, you could have a glass of nice fresh water. (I would presume it's fresh)
He’s taken the dark side it’s exEGGcute
"I can't remember what glass is like, its blue right?" - Grunty boi
hello mikey
Caffeine is a chemical that plants developed to repel insects and people drink coffee so the petlil tea isn't that weird.
I never knew u could eat all these pkmn😮
I am so happy vanillite, vanillish or vanilluxe didnt become food in this video. I love those. (and i dont want them to be eaten)
some octillery-rings would sound nice
The thing you said about not wanting to eat Bambi but you would eat his mom is the same joke my Biology teacher makes all the time
The darkest part of this video is Mikey saying he dislikes lamb
on the discussion of edible leaves being used as bug repellant, cedar can be boiled into a tea to cure scurvy (niche use for sure) but if you rub it on your skin, it will also keep mosquitoes away
What about fidough??
The grunty boy lore expandssssss
I love how you didnt include the ice cream pokemon because you realized that it's not vanilla, it's pure snow
What about combee honey?
HOW DO YOU MISS VANILITE, VANILISH, AND VANILUX?  THEY ARE LITERALLY ICE CREAM
The vanillite line: I live to fight another day Michael
you forgot the vanillite line
What about alligator, or in this case Feraligatr meat? Gator meat is tasty so I'm throwing one on the grill
I like Miltank and Unfezant. It hurts me to see Mikey have such a hatred for two of my favorite pokemon.
7:13 wait, what?
"Farfetch'd is nearly extinct" Now I know why it's only a 1% encounter in kanto....
The "mandjtv out of context" series is gonna love this one
This is the funniest video of Micky's in my personal opinion
As a kangaroo, I also ate a kangaroo burger in the market where I live, and it was delicious.
Octopus like grapploct seems like a great food because real life octopus is great
Fried gator tail is rather delicious, so the fried tails of any of the few Gator Pokémon would probably be good
Mh...this video makes me hungry. XD
mmmmmmm yumny appletun skin
yass finally
"i'll eats his mom though"    *AYO?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
I personally live in Massachusetts and that Boston accent hurt lmao but I still love the vids❤
Plus its cononical that pokemon get processed because of the new sandwich mechanic in scarlet and violet
Mikey: I think I'll eat it now  *Eats Chansey eggs* Mikey(five seconds later): think I'll eat it now *Breaks his teeth on a happiny "egg"*
Cant wait for scarlet and violet
i would eat a steelix
"Shukles juice"
I would LOVE to munch some JUICY meat of Miltank
3:23 someone please edit this out of context
Magikarp
What about Octillery?  Would you eat that?  Or keeping Combee around like a Pokemon world beekeeper?  (Okay, you're not eating the pokemon, but a product of it.)  In the anime, they mention Grottle can grow nuts on its back and Ash and company tried some.  I wonder if you could use Bayleef as an ingredient in cooking, too.  I'd eat Wooloo lamb chops.  Yum!  I've eaten ostrich before, so Dodrio would probably cook up nicely :)
Though I don’t like the idea of eating my favourite Pokémon, Tangelas’ vines, according to its entry in Legends: Arceus, impart a refreshing sensation when chewed, and also quite useful as a cooking spice. Plus, I’m sure Tangela would need to have its vines trimmed from time to time too, so I’d get some nice edible cooking ingredients, and give my Tangela a good trim, so I guess it’s not technically eating the Pokémon as a whole. Side Note: Tangrowths’ vines would be too time consuming to trim, so while that would probably be in the same category, I’d need some extra people to help with this one.
This is just hypothetical but Fidough is made out of dough, so you could maybe  bake him into a cake?
Sad fidough noises
Dinner ideas for you and drowzee?
Not a pokemon but, a pokemon product:   Combee Honey!
OK i had enouh, i love Unfezant so much, and im so mad at you constantly saying its dumb!  Im not the one who loves two flying balls. Thats the dumbest pokemon idea ever. How does that makes you feel ???? Unfezant is literally my fav bird. STOP IT.
I think you could eat Fidough but have the gilt and shame haunt you
hi mandjtv!
7:45 that is a dangerous train of thought my friend
The just pokemon that are food with faces the Vanilluxe line would be delicious ice cream
POV local poketuber desperately trying to make enough content to reach the scarlet Violet release date. Absolutely love it, apparently difficulty breeds innovation and comedy, great job mikey.
I'll take some vanilite ice cream
For something sweet and cold on a very hot summer day (screw Gerogia heat) I would gladly eat any of the vanilite line with some chocolate syrup or some sprinkles
Alright everyone i need chefs and waiters for my pokemon themed restaurant
Sauteed celebi with a dish would probably be amazing.
Now claim your first day ticket here
7:41 actually caffeine is used by plants as a plant repellent
pumpkin is really good with spicy stuff, in our country 90% pumpkin is used to cook spicy food.
what about the ice cream Pokémons whose name I don't remember
Claim your “here in an hour” ticket now!!
I think vanilluxe abd magikarp would be real nice!!!!
Dear god
Frogadier, frog Legs tent to be delicious. Also horsea or kingdra, shrimps are delicious so why not?
I know this technically doesn't have to do with the video, but if you're going to get the raycon gaming earbuds just before forwarren they pick up an incredible amount of background noise. I got them for my mom for mother's Day and then a month later she gave them back to me because she didn't like them.
I would also like a cup of Shuckle Juice 😃
i would melt regice and drink it
You should watch the food theory video on what pokemon people in the pokemon world regularly eat, as it may sway your decisions.
early
Your New England accent was terrible, Michael. LMAO  Also, I'd definitely eat Miltank steak with a nice cold Snover berry smoothie.
Blublasuars bulb
“i’ll eat him mom tho” manjtv- 2022
This video hits different when you’re eating.
That roo meat was probably prepared badly, kangaroo stew is amazing, highly recommended, occasionally schools and companies will do kangaroo stew for certain events and it’s always amazing
I think u forgot bunny meat. Personally, I would love to est Lopunny’s a——
what about vespiquen or combee? don't they make honey also, you forgot to say you would gladly eat well cooked Milktank sausage nipple...XD
I would eat Jacks Buneary.
yow magikarp
Mikey rocking that Austin FC fit
hi
And the tails grow back!
As someone who has eaten ostrich, doduo and dodrio would be a nice meal, I'll bet. Also some fugu style quilfish has to be good eating if you're in to that kind of sushi. Also fried croconaw could be a thing since fried alligator is a real thing for sure.  Also you mentioned how it would be weird to use the leaves of a petilil as both tea and a bug repellent, but like we do that with mint irl so it's not that odd of a thought ✨👀✨
Oh my, this thumbnail😅😂
I'm pretty sure that Grunty Boi admitted to liking bluegrass music.
I feel like a straightforward one is Combee's honey.  It falls into the other Pokemon byproducts.
I don't think you can eat Unfezant, only baby pheasants are good for eating, so you'll have to eat Pidove. Ps: its my favorite kind of meat.
Well pumpkin flavoured things aren't actually made with pumpkin their made with pumpkin spice which is named after the colour of the spice nothing to do with pumpkins
Thanks know i need food
You wouldn't eat vanillite?
I love kangaroo meat have it every time the world food fair is in my town 😁
Me: *Eating yummy tasty medium rare miltank* Whitney: *Bawling her eyes out because I threw her cow in the stove to win the gym battle*
I would eat some frog legs. Sorry John
Why do I feel like miltank nipples would be a delicacy…
Man's gotta eat
“I’m not going to eat Bambi. I’ll eat his mom though” lol xD that had me laughing
3:22 Suspicious
Surprised you skipped honey makers, Combee's honey is constantly referenced as being incredibly sweet and tasty, with different swarms producing various flavors.  Of course...you'd have to worry about Vespiquen trying to pull you into the hive to eat you, but only if you have to harvest the honey yourself.
Hey mikey you should react to lockstin’s Pokémon legends neo ghetsis series
This is the video for the peoples
Mikey, you literally discussed Galarian Darumaka chasing Snover for its berries before. Abomisnow will throw you over Mount Coronet.
Play Fortnite
Saw the video title and screamed NO MIKEY NO
Please eat medicham!   Please.🥺
Chad"buneary"
What about the the vanillite line? They are ice cream cones? You could at least make snow cream with them.
3:30 I also recommend bison burgers. My first one was at a restaurant called Fuddrucker’s, and my first bite of it caused me to laugh with enjoyment. Sadly there are very few of them left, and none near me. 2:38 Also it’s quite ironic that even though several people have joked about the Tepig line being “living, breathing bacon”, Mikey wouldn’t want to eat any of them. I thought he’d at least eat a Pignite.
Now, who's gonna do the challenge run?
How about trying pinakbet with pumpkin then. It's a Filipino vegetable dish with meat in it and it tastes amazing.
I was expecting a whole lot more joy and satisfaction in your eyes when talking about eating miltank though😂😂😂😂
Pokemon but we create more Ghost types
I remember this OG Mikey video, so I’m happy to see it get a well-deserved reboot!
How did he miss vinilish
What about vanilluxe or it's pre evolution
Ice cream it’s food with a face!!!
Ooop
Never thought I would be listening to a guy discussing why he would eat certain pokemon.  Yet here I am  Though I am curious about blissey's eggs though, I'd love to make a cake or something with it, It sounds good ngl
Where's vanilluxe?
Vanillish
3:21 you didn't tell me not to take it out of context
"How's Malamar going to mind control me..... if it's dead?" A philosophy you can fundamentally apply to all parts of life.
yes thank you for not putting magikarp and unlike most people understand that magikarp aint even edible
I would probably eat gyarados
Beef and chicken are the best meats  Also lamb is amazing but only when you know someone who cooks it nice
That stupid gen 9 pig that I can’t pronounce his name be like….
i would eat fuecoco it looks like a apple
As I see in this video I think you should eat less types of meat since sometimes it’s not good also my Dad and my uncles assume that eat many variants of meat is the cause that my oldest uncle got cancer
lol
Another pumpkin lover! This is a miracle!
missed the opportunity to go, “Eatings Pokefans!”
Hello there I'm here
i feel like octillary shoyld be on the menu as octopus is very similar to calamari
3:22 "I'll eat his mom tho" had me dying laughing  if you know you know
tropius bananas
Look like you forgot drowzee
I’ve lost my appetite
I have an idea for a video. Maybe you can rank all of the Pokémon games in your opinion.
All this talk about eating Pokémon is making me hungry. Though I wouldn't usually eat Pokémon, if I were living in the Pokemon world I'd have to make exceptions. Plus so many of those dishes sound very good, also I could eat plants as well berries and others. I wonder what kind of dishes come from differen regions. I'm sure each region has their own signature dish.
Besides most of the ones you mentioned, I would go for some Croconaw, Feraligatr, Croconaw and Krookodile meat since I do like crocodile meat. Totodile and Sandile are too small.  I could also go for some Politoed, Frogadier and Greninja legs. Frog legs are quite tasty as well.  Even though I do like kangaroo meat, I'd suspect Kangaskhan is too endangered and maybe too stringy to eat, so Breloom is the closest to kangaroo meat that I would try.
I think Celebi is just an onion so I’d eat it                       *Also Smoliv*
The spirits included with the Pumkaboo would give the pumpkin part flavor and build character 😂
So he’s not eating the ice cream pokemon?
So this is how you make sandwiches in scarlet and violet! (also wiglet is an eel-inspired pokemon)
GRUNTY BOY LORE. HES MAGIC.
instead of "smash or pass", it's "cook or not"
The Vegan Teacher gonna cancel you for this
But Mikey, don’t you know if you drink too much Miltank milk, you’ll turn into one? Or at the very least, begin to look like one.
I am vegetarian
For venison,  you forgot about Xerneas.  I'm sure that deer meat would be heavenly 😋
Ig Mikey doesn't like Ice Cream or Fidough. I'd try a large number of pokemon as food
Ooh, now I'm in the mood for pumpkin treats
You missed the ice scream Pokemon
"I've decided to add pro gamer to my resume"
6:12 the fact that I named my torchic/combusken KFC💀
I wood absolutely eat an oddish or belsprout. sure, oddish is blue, but i dont mind, and bellsprout does have toxic fluids in its body, but that can be fixed through proper preparation
Magnaton do be looking scrumptious tho 👀
Grunty boy
Mikey be getting in the mood for Palworld next year, I see
Why didn't I get notifications for this
Cooked milktank
The thumbnail is hailarios and apropried
"I'll eat it's _mom_ though"  - Mandjtv, 2022
I believe Shiinotic is supposed to be a “magic” mushroom, so be prepared for a weird ass trip
Anyone gonna tell Mikey that pumpkin pie and most other pumpkin spice products don’t actually have pumpkin in them?
New England not just Boston, but yes
FACE BACON
Miss the days when grunty boy and michael were enemies
You forgot vanillite, vanilish and vaniluxe. Unless you don't Iike ice cream
Hahahahahhahha
13:50 Tynamo's not tiny, its AVERAGE
For the Farfetch'd "if it's endangered, it has to be good", I present the Dodo bird, a bird that went extinct not because of it's own taste, being described as not the best, but instead because of a completely different animal entirely. The Galapagos tortoise made the Dodo bird extinct due to it's fats tasting divine and being able to use it on other foods as one would use butter.  So I would add Wartortle and Blastoise to the mix of Pokémon I’d eat. Also, I need my Torchic nuggets, so that has to go, too.  Edit: The reason I chose Wartotle and Blastoise is because the Torterra, Carracosta, and Drednaw lines and Turtonator are based off of different types of turtles, and Torkoal doesn’t seem as edible
What about Ice or Ice Cream? Vanillish or Vanilluxe would be good to eat to cool off on a hot day.
It Maybe Sound weird But tsareena and florges i dont know why but they Look 😋
For anyone trying to play Scarlet and Violet blind (like me), here's your spoiler warning. There is a new pokemon talked about in this video briefly.  Edit: he's usually pretty good about it, to ensure no one sees this as a complaint
you are a wizard granty
You cookin or me
Kid: “Mom, what's for dinner?"  Mom: “Just wait dear, I'm just exorcising this Pumpkin."
Forgot to mention those sweet drowzee cheeks
I would eat pikachu cuz imma cramorant
Also smolive .......I don't know if I spelled it right but it's literally a olive .... And vanilluxe too and maybe fidough it's a donut dpg
If the people in the Pokemon world ate Basculin more often then maybe Basculegion would still be around
Nice update and if pokemon exsit sorry to your friends I'll eat the feesh ( magicarp)
I'd throw in Skiddo and Gogoat for some good goat stew.
grunty boy has acquired the god complex
You forgot about the banana's on Tropious' chin
You'll like my aunt's Pumpkin Roll. Delicioso!
Comment for algorithm
when there' somethin' strange, in your pumpkin patch. who you gonna call?    Ghost Busters!
Pretty sure we've covered this, but this video was a lot more involved and covered new pokemon, so cool!
Mikey: Not only would I eat Miltank, I would feel good about it
I can't believe he wouldn't eat out drowzee
I won't accept this violent snubbing of fidough! This is tantamount to Pokemon cruelty. EAT THAT FIDOUGH! EAT THAT FIDOUGH
By far one of the weirdest Pokémon videos out there, and yes, I'm including Markiplier's video
Bro forgot rabbits and not gonna lie I would definitely eat a rabbot or a lopunny serve it right up
You shoulda colab with mythical kitchen for this vid🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:21 AYO
3:23 Ayo?🤨📸
Would you eat vannilish? Or whatever that line’s called
I would like to point out my one dislike of this video, the sponsor of the video. Before the pitchforks rise: It is not because of the company itself nor is it because of Grunty. It's the video that demonstrates the headphones. You can straight up see the PS4 controller wasn't on. This is why I advertising.
Not my tail😢
Gigantamax alcremie for a big birthday party.
Personally I don’t think that trying to eat Piloswine is smart, because it could kill you.
PUMPKIN MUFFIN!!
I can just imagine some more feral trainers openly eat pokemon even if they aren't pressed for food.
I would argue sharing love with a sentient creature is better than considering a 10 year old an adult.
In a Professor Oak segment we see him drinking Skiddo milk so there’s that! (I’m assuming you don’t want goat meat tho yeah?)   There’s Fidough, though its probably too small for you too? At least you can use its yeast breath for cooking!  Anyway fun video!
The honey that Combee and Vespiquen gather !
Yo, but how do you feel about chili, Mikey? Pumpkin's delicious in chili.
Sceptile
Of course Miktank is in the thumbnail  Ngl it looks good
The haterd for Meltank have reached a new height I see, Miky would rather drive the whole meltank population  become extinct and enjoy it to the last bite and never see them ever again
Ah yes the perfect video to watch while I'm eating lunch- Also, thanks, I was actually looking to buy a new headset! ^^
7:29 Fun fact: There's a menu in Pokemon Cafe Remix game called Lilligant Floral Tea
Fuecoco is eaten
I would also eat  vanillite and vanilish not sure about vanillux tho maybe if I have someone to share with
i was so sure he was gonna put drowzee's booty on that list
I'm very annoyed at how he didn't include magicarp
Grunty boy should touch grass
Remember that the pokedex was made by kids so…
You should do a reaction to BDG's "most edible pokemon", it's a banger! (If you haven't seen it already)
never thought i´d see you revisit this subject i remember you did a video like this years back great to see speaking of rekvisits or follow ups hope we get a my first 100 days in Minecraft follow up soon too honestly most of these i could sat too except the shrooms i hate mushrooms both taste and texture just ugh i hav tried der sausage once which is very good tbh
Okay I am going to confess something here having seen the bit about Unfezant. Not only do I like Unfezant, I like most cases in Pokemon where the male and female of the species look different, but my pick for worst regional bird is controversial to most. I cannot stand any member of the Starly line. Y'all can keep those beady eyed, coiffured chicken rejects away from me 😁I also think Talonflame is massively overrated but I recognise I have a bias against most things Gen VI and that isn't Talonflame's fault
you missed Moltres
Before we start, miltank is holy for us hindus.🤣
do you think you could drink a sinistea?
Updated version of the Original And the old one had Crawdaunt...
a remake of my first ever mandjtv video!? TODAY IS A GOOD DAY!
Who else watched this and immediately reminisced to the first time Mikey did a “eating Pokémon” video😂?? So many years have passed
6:12 _flashbacks to Dorkly’s if Pokédex entries were literal entire torchic line with chicken so spicy it causes the consumer to burst into flames_ “This is fine.”
"People are eating that, it must be safe."  Pufferfish: Yes, but actually no
I would ABSOLUTELY DEVOUR A SLOWPOKE TAIL
The original video was the one I started watching you with
If you ate miltank you would eat the milk, which would make you a miltank
i'd love myself some combusken thigh 🍗🍗😋
Eating a combusken reminds me of bojack horseman and its chicken4days advert
That thumbnail 😂
Slowpoke's tail coming off painlessly makes sense with shellder
3:34 its because you want the extinct them
Oh God this video is too dark . . . Tbh I  might eat some of them too lool
No frogs? 👀👀
In the pokemon world it maybe odd but it makes the most sense considering we eat all kinds of animals from common meat of  pigs cow chicken to ducks calamari deer to even rare chances of alligator/crocodile and more
I don’t know if Electross counts because it’s more based on a lamprey
Thanks,Mikey,now I'm hungry for some burgers and bacon!
This video is the *definition* of chaotic neutral
Pokémon PETA fans gonna riot 😂
13:53 moming on
Can I get a like?
Do you not like ice cream what about vanilite
Obviously Michael would eat Cloyster ifykyk
Peta gotta watch this  and btw im not gonna say anything about snover bcs diamond and pearl episode it likes giving people its berries and its deliciouse and dude dont eat alcreamy in pokemon journeys it ses it loves to give cream and its cream is sweeter if the pokemon is friendlier
Try the Pidgey line.
( read this in a fancy gentlemen accent)    Mmmm yes i personally would Like a sepperated perfect cooked part of trubbish i  think it would be perfectly delightfully sweet and would have crispy crunchy parts just thinking about it makes me hungry excuse me the garbage truck just arrived farewell good sir
Smash or Pass but with eating
Would Jigglypuff taste like a Marshmallow?
Fun fact about real world lobsters that might be the reason krawdant isn’t considered a menu item, lobsters become toxic pretty fast when they die so they have to be boiled alive when people serve it. Maybe krawdant is similar, that because it’s too big to fit in a pot they have to kill it which means it’s body quickly goes toxic. But korfish should be okay to eat it, like I said, boiled alive. Kind of dark but that is seriously the best way to prepare a lobster meal.
1:57 She's trying her best :(
I remember this video 5 years ago
3:23 Ayo what did he say?!
One needs a lot of guts to watch this video while having their dreams, imagination, love towards Pokémons etc etc everything chewed down with a glass of shuckle juice
4:40 YOUR A WIZARD GRUNTY!!!
And I quote "I'll eat his mom tho"
If, hypothetically, a poison type Pokémon lost its ability to poison someone after slaughtered for consumption, I’d be down to try Bulbasaur - it’s both meat and veggie in one. I’d be hesitant with Ivysaur for a bit, given it’s leaves make me think of poison ivy, so if they were removed, then maybe.  Also, an odd one to try would be Raticate. Given its size and appearance, it looks similar to a Nutria, a semiaquatic rodent commonly found across the Deep South. During my visit to Louisiana, I got to try some Nutria meat, which was low in calories and fat, but also tasted similar to ground beef. I wouldn’t eat a Raticate all the time compared to a Miltank, but if I was in need of food, I’d suffice with one. The Alolan form would be off the table, given it’d likely be too fatty and not be as healthy.  Cherubi would be a good fruit option, given the dex says it’s smaller berry is very tasty, though it would hinder its evolution, but it’s a grass type, so it would likely take time to regrow the small berry. If that’s not the case, I’d look for something else.  My final picks would be the Cacnea line. Cactuses are full of water and likely taste like cucumbers. If they don’t taste like that, at least they’ll hydrate me to no end. Cactus juice - it’ll quench ya!
What about vanilish?
Nobody:  Purplecliffe: 3:23
oh so thats why pretty much every shuckle i catch is holding berry juice
I love meat. Like, LOVE meat. I also work in a warehouse, so I'm a girl who needs a LOT of protein. That being said, if I lived in the Pokemon world... I'd probably avoid meat, and just stick to getting my protein from eggs or supplements. Maybe it's just because I was not raised with the idea that eating some Pokemon is okay, but I just don't like the thought of it. Plus, sounds like the egg stuff would make me happy enough. lolz.  Also, I feel the same as you, Mikey, in regards to pumpkin. I very much love pumpkin stuff. The ice cream i get on my birthday every year is pumpkin cheesecake flavor (if you haven't, you should try some, it's delicious).
i feel like the vegan teacher will make a video about this
Imagine being a trainer who’s had a Magikarp basically birth, living and training with everyday, forming a life long friendship with it, even after it evolves into Gyrados, and you just some guy eat a Magikarp he just caught like it was nothing.
The miltank on the thumbnail looks good to throw away
Grunty Boi is a treasure
Mmm, moomoo steak sounds delicious
"I'll eat his mom though."   ------- Michael
The first remake video. YAY
What ever happened to grunty bois date?
Hear me out.... COMBEE HONEY!!!
Where ice cream?
Mikey making this video Purplecliffe exist:            I would eat Gardevoir.
Lopunny is my no 1 pick
It's weird that a pigeon, a garbage bird, becomes a pheasant
I don't think anyone will eat the true God bidoof right hand man lechonk
2:17
Honestly the vaniluxe (I hope I spelled that right) line would probably be delicious.   Except I’m lactose intolerant  Also he forgot his lover, Drowsey!
Fidough.
I've always been curious how WishiWashi would taste like I would imagine it would be salty and taste of the ocean!
"I think grass is blue" really got me.
I’m surprised you didn’t mention magikarp.
Mmmmm Lechonk Ham!
ok, I would prolly eat a lot of these, but I would never eat one of my mushroom bois
8:16 you know it has a bug for a tail don't you?
I this video was cool, but don’t do that! But I think you should save the the hunger for a bag of chips!
What if smoliv’s oil was watered down
I will also eat Axew
What about Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe? They're snow cones! Drizzle with some of those Shuckle berry juice and you've got yourself a sweet treat!
okay I really had to laugh with the pumpkin set. Especially since I love a good pumpkin pie. it was actually what I always wanted instead of cake for my birthday (which just passed earlier this week). that and my aunt's pumpkin torte with caramel over the top.
Wasn't aware that Crawdaunt's meat doesn't taste good, learned something new
bro really ran out of ideas
DO NOT DRIK THE MILK IT WILL MAKE YOU TURN IN TO A MILEKTANK
Every Pokemon I would eat. Gardevoir.
I would have more Lower morals lol
Mikey not being inclined to like savory pumpkin food kinda surprised me, since in my country, squashes are considered more of a savory vegetable than a sweet one. I personally love pumpkin soup, but I feel weird to try pumpkin pie or pumpkin spice latte, since I'm so used to eating it as a savory food.
I would be vegetarian in the pokemon universe, I can eat meat normally because I barely have contact with the farm animals, but when the animal are WAY more sentient and way more common even in the city, I would be able to do this.
Apparently Clawitzer tastes very good.
Surprised drowse wasn’t on here
He was hungry whilst making this
Surprised I didn’t see drowzee on this list
that vegan teacher wants to know your location
See that's the thing. If you don't wanna eat processed food or starve, there's not a lot of options in the Pokémon world. I wouldn't go out of my way to kill one for consumption but if I had nothing else I would probably enjoy a nice Milktank meal.
So... Shuckle is a wine machine
Its so nice that grunty boi and mikey are actual friends now... Brings a tear to my eye 😭
Is this a remake from the old one
Sorry Mike, as a vegetarian, I won't watch this video 😬
Bro stir-fry Bulbasaur would be fire
i so agree with your list, and your damn right, bison burger are just excellent i always cook some from time to time during summer. as for kangoroo meat, i have tried it and yeah the cooking process needs to be done right or it will not be as good, but if done well it is really tasty as long as you like a meat that has a strong taste.
“I’ll eat his mom though” Best sentence of 2022
Another thing about Shuckle's juice comes from the Pokemon side game "Detective Pikachu" on the 3DS!   WARNING! Behind the "Show More" is spoilers for Chapter 3 of the game! Do not read onwards unless you don't care about spoilers or have played up through this point.    While Tim and Pikachu are at the PCL, during an experiment with Nina in the courtyard, the player uses various berries (specifically red, blue, green, and yellow ones) with the help of Shuckle to make an orange juice (orange as in the color, not the fruit). Then, they take the juice to Klefki, who unlocks the storage room and the director's room.
I’ll eat wormadam since I like pizza and you can’t tell me it is not a pizza.
As someone that’s from Boston, nailed the accent 😂❤
I'm loving grunty boi more and more every video 💀💀
You forgot crookidile alligator nuggets
This is going to be interesting
Alcremie in every flavorrrrr
For breakfast we have eggxecute omelette and For lunch we have slowpoke tail stew and for dinner we have militank cheeseburger and milkshake
Thanks... I will Eat milktank every morning and I will drink Castforms rain
I would eat gardevoir...
I’m upset you didn’t talk about bugs
i think i would like a pancake with milktanks meat
You say you would eat various deer Pokémon because you already enjoy venison. I ask you this: would you eat a Xerneas? I would.
Best video to watch, while eating breakfast 🍽 🥞 🥓 🍳 🌯🧃😋
I have a story about me wanting to eat Miltank. I nicknamed a Miltank in Pokémon GO, Meat In Day, because of a food related political issue in my home state. After some political issues in my home state between the state government and farmers/ranchers, people were split between the governor's Meat Out Day. As my family supports local farmers and ranchers, as we have raised animals for 4H like pigs and chickens, we were against the Meat Out Day and like many others in the state, we sides with the Meat IN Day and some cities and towns had community Meat In Celebrations and had a large buffet of meat along with other food, because the meat industry helped our states economy.
You forgot rabbids, Im sure allot of people would like to eat Lopunny💀😉
You mentioned klawf but not fidough??? Cool it up and you got some tasty doggy shaped biscuits/treats
i like scorbunny meat
It seems delicious
Would you eat tauros Rocky Mountain oysters?
Mikey would eat the whole world of Miltank so they'll be no more.
I wonder how the ham from Scarlet and Violet would taste like
Honestly grunty Boi would be the kind of person to listen to classical music
What about combee's honey
the aura guardian "what did you just speak about my pink cow friend?"
Wow
Me seeing the title: *skips video*  Sees the thumbnail: *CLICKS VIDEO*
You would eat Wyrdeer? That is an extinct species, where are you getting the meat? That's the most morally wrong Pokemon to eat in the whole video. Also, Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist are Jack-o-Lanterns, meaning they're already hollowed out. You would just be eating the rind.
vanillite would be diliocusdoer3g2t3rqwd
I always saw Team Rocket chopping off the Slowpoke tails forcefully being the equivalent of a human "meat farm" while letting the tail drop off would be "free range." It still makes sense to me why the people of Azalea were giving the Rockets so much stank in Johto.
3:43 the revenge was taken
just the thumbnail that he's serious
I’ll eat it’s mom tho 😂😂😂
HE MENTIONED THE LEGEND LECHONK!!
If its endangered, then just action replay until oblivion, or breed it to oblivion 😈
Well chikorita is basically a herb so I would eat it
pheasant is delicious you should try it some time
Hello 👋
beens
there are normal pumpkins in Pokémon
I LOVE ME SOME FRESH MEDIUM RARE MILTANK HAHAHA!
“I’ve decided to add pro gamer to my resume”
I want to make a full-course meal team now 😂
Mikey: I would never hunt a pokemon to extinction Also Mikey: the enjoyment of eating miltank is it's demise   Also, Grunty, go touch grass
lechonk ham
Who hasn't looked at Mewtwo and thought to themselfs: "Yummy!"
Executor is seeds rigth? People can eat seeds rigth?
mikey smoothly skiping part about the berry mixed with the shuckle body fluids to make it not sound weird is hillarious lol
appletun is a pasturey
correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t one of Sceptile’s Dex entries say how the seeds on its back are filled with vitamins?
Mmmmm magikarp
I hate duck meat but I would happily eat a quaxly
Pumpkin soup is amazing
To me miltank is not worthy enough to eat... it is too evil and I do not want it's evil spreading to me..
What about Magikarp, Octillery, Milotic, Vespiquens honey, Buneary, the Vanillite evo line, Bunnelby and Gogoat?
dun fact this is a remake of a old video😊😊
Shuckle’s juice Lemme explain 😂😂😂
Fidough is bread, smoliv is an olive.
Mikey, buddy, if you hunt those Miltanks to endangerment, keep on trucking! We’ll wipe ‘‘em off the face of the earth!
"I'll eat his mom, though"  Easily in Top 5 Mikey quotes of 2022
What about the new doggo it’s literally made with bread
I'd eat chikorita
I would try a dragon at least once...
This was the LAST thing that I expected to see in my youtube feed this morning.  That doesnt have to be a bad thing though
Scarlet and Violet haven’t even come out yet are you’re already talking about eating gen 9 pokémon smh
I thought for sure Exeggcute would be in this list, but hearing that Mikey has come around to the fact that they're seeds, not eggs, I was like: "Impossible. 0^0 "
Mikey cool video but we want a try not to laugh with jack do it
“I’m not gonna eat bambi, I’ll eat his mom though.” Had me dying.
I would never actually eat an Alcremie because it's adorable and my top favorite pokemon, but its pokedex entry states that it secretes cream from its hands and the cream's sweetness depends on how happy it is. I have a strong interest in baking, so having a couple Alcremie around in various cream flavors could make for some rather delicious pastries!
Nice redo of an old videos of your's
Ah yes piloswine= frozen bacon
I think if he was in the Pokémon world, he would open a miltank meat restaurant and put a team sky base under it
Support mikey hopefully soon u pm7 and purplecliff will have time to continue POKE SMP!
Smoliv is an olive
SAVAGE
i would eat wooper bidoof helix
where is vanillish line?
"I'm not gunna eat Bambi.. I'll eat his mom though"
Lopunny wouldbe a Pokémon whose meat I would eat
I'd like to try eating something with an alakazam's spoon. It's dex says that whatever you eat Eitan alakazam's spoon taste delicious
You eat a Pumpkaboo. You realize it knew Destiny Bond...
Can you make a video on if they remade the shadow Pokémon games. I think it would be a fun concept.
Vinniluxe???
The guy who hates Mikey:"i would eat rayquaza"
Cant believe Mikey wouldnt eat the dish that drowzee made for him
13:54 I got scared for a second. I was about to go “Get the hell away from my favorite Alolan Bug!”
I wouldn't eat eelektross. Too much on the Lamprey side for my taste, though I am aware that Lamprey are edible
This is oddly nostalgic. It brings me back to old days of Gen 6/7 era.
Can you make a video about the towns in pokemon where you wanna live?
1:im sad that you whould eat klot 1:what about the alive icecream huh?you dont like icecream!?!
Thank you Dookieshed for helping me discover this trend- xD
Vanilluxe for days
0:19 oh no I already see all of the artists smiling
Mudsdale
Pokémon Id eat?  LOPUNNY…..for rabbit stew.   What were you thinking?
I'm a loyal supporter
In the anime and in dex entries it’s shown Grotle grows nuts on its tree for smaller Pokémon to have so likely also Torterra so what about that
PUMPKIN SPICED EVERYTHING!  I LOVE IT!
SAUSAGE NIPPLES
Grunty Boi needs to touch Grass.
Rabbit meat is decent, so i'd be down to try some Bunnelby and Diggersby meat. Bunneary's too cute though, and Lopunny's...well... Too humanoid. :"D
3:22 Jesus that’s dark
We have to eat to live of course you like to eat goofy. Also how tf did grunty boy learn magic without going to the college of winter hold
Mandjtv! I love your videos and I'm so happy that I managed to watch your videos within and hour of posting
Let’s hope that vegan teacher doesn’t see this
Somewhere out there in the pokemon world there's a big game hunter that likes the taste of Gyarados.
You could have included Klawf
There's another one I would eat, and it's the one talking ;)
I would eat alolan exeggutor
combee honey is apparently really good
I got a female shiny Alolan Raichu in Sun and Moon years ago and nicknamed it Syrup. ITS DEX ENTIRES STATES HOW IT MAKES PANCAKES!!! Who wouldn’t want that?! Waffle-people wouldn’t, but i like both anyway
M&j: I won't eat bambi but I'll eat it's mom  Me: ayo wtf
Slowpoke Tail Stew sounds amazing.
Very intersting topic for a pokemon video! I never thought about eating pokemon but this video really made me want to eat Milktank!!!
What about magikarp?
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
3:20 " I'm not gonna eat Bambi, I'll eat his mom though" AYOOOO
Why would you not eat chikorita, its literally a pear
Snover's berries. You covered that in a dex review video, so this isn't the first time you learned about it, you just forgot it.
Early
Chansey and Blissey carry anti-depressants in its eggs.
“I’ll eat his mom though” I better get on Aspintpiay 😂
Here we go again
How many of these Pokemon now want to eat MANDJ?
Pumpkin tastes better in savory dishes
I would eat grumpig because not only will it make great meat its also good for another cough drugs cough
Why is everything in Unova the region overpopulated
All hail the king, for he has graced us with his presence on this glorious day!
It would be really cool to see an artist design like all the pokemon-food items Mikey described here. That would be super cool to see "Pumpkaboo Pie" or "Malamri" 😁
3:20 ayooooo
If I exclusively eat grass-type Pokémon, would that still make me vegetarian?
What about all the icecream pokemon??????????
Yummy
9:42 OH BOY TIME TO EAT MY FIRST EVER SHINY YAY 😁!
He does try his best to make the advertisements funny😂
In Finland, we actually eat ''bambi''..
Sounds good thanks ima EAT THEM
Here’s a tip,Mikey: Work at the slaughterhouse in the Pokémon world. Then, you get to be the one to kill the Miltank, or at least watch it die.
"How's Malamar gonna mind control me... if it's dead?" Can't argue with logic🤣
The Sequel we didn’t deserve.
Poor vegetarian me ;-;
The bug repellent thing isint to strange, peanuts have a similar effect, and a lott of plants produce a chemical that insects cant stand but ar hamless to other animals
No Vanillite line?!
Happy
Lets hope ThatVeganTeacher never finds this video...
eat ? kinda sus
This checked off one of my MandJtv future vids bingo
Man, this really makes me want a turkey Pokémon to exist!
You... Do realize that farmers only send off male cattle to be used for meat right? The females provide not only milk but can help produce offspring to continue the business. You must hold a big grudge against Miltank whereas most others like myself take into account our losses against Whitney and use Miltanks of our own to win battles since they're competitively viable ever since Gen 4 when they started getting the Scrappy ability
China be like: golbat needs to be on this list
Isn’t it a little early in the morning for video?
23 minutes ago!!!!$
Mikey: crosses off exeggcute and paras for being seeds even though seeds are also edible and because of the mind controlling shrooms that pókedex says to actually be pretty healthy  Also Mikey: eats a sugar coated dog
I would eat miltank to
Where is vaniluxe?
Hi people I just got here
On a warm day, time to have a lovely vaniluxe :P
You forgot Arceus
Seriously what's this guy problem with milktant i mean i know but get over it pal
As a 16 year old pho food critic I think this would be accurate.
Yes
Just commenting for the algorithm
3:20  Could make it less sus sounding😏
Swilix is bork but it is My bork
grunty boy once said "I don't remember what grass is like it's blue right?"
This is the content I never thought I needed before watching it 😂
Just advice with the pork: the older the animal, the tougher the meat. The younger the animal, the more tender the meat. I'd eat Lechonk. Heck the name without the K is a Spanish pork dish
For the apprently tough muscular pignite and emboar I'd recommend slow roasting or smoking them to break down the connective tissues while maintaining the flavor. Also I'm gonna go by d&d logic and assume they're just like red dragons in that their meat is naturally spicy.
I’d be willing to eat Paras line mushrooms. Parasect’s mushroom has been stated to have medicinal properties in the anime, so it is probably safe to consume, and by removing a Paras’ mushrooms I might be able to save it from being killed by its evolution, maybe even evolving into a whole new Pokémon
I would eat the subscribe and like button haha
lol
lol
If we're counting things pokemon produce, we can't forget combee's honey. I think I remember it was delicious in the anime
lol
Secuqel
Vanillux
lol
Perfect!
Chikorita
Would you eat drowzee?
Now he can legaly say "bro I ait your mom".
I was dying laughing when he said he would eat miltank so he could enjoy it’s demise
What about Vanilite family ?
Icecream Pokémon, Vanillite, Vanillish, and Vanilluxe
Nom Nom
Mikey, also don’t forget that they serve you Slowpoke tails in some of the Kalos restaurants. They also have some dishes that they cook in Arbok’s poison, which is apparently not only safe, but good?
I mean alligator meat is kinda buss for real, so maybe some crocodile or alligator pokemon might taste good.
Invite to your Thanksgiving dinner when the time comes around!
My day gets immediately better whenever Mikey posts!
More like: "Gotta eat 'em all", am I right? Ehehehe... *awkward silence*
What about fidough!?
6:20 those aren’t drumsticks...
I would live to eat Jigglypuff. I imagine it has consistency of meat but the taste if cotton candy.
Tepig Pignite and Emboar are just spicy bacon and them swinub piloswine and mamoswime are frozen bacon
Of corse you would eat milltank
Togepi seems great tho. Sooooo many ways to eat it too. And finally a use for the togepi cynthia gives in platinum
THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED 14 MINUTES AGO AND THERE ARE ALREADY OVER 400 COMMENTS WHAT HAPPENED HERE
Okay. Hear me out. Dragonite. Now I know what you’re thinking, it’s a powerful and adorable pseudo legend, how could I eat it? Well that’s exactly why. It’s plump and would probably be incredibly delicious, and who wouldn’t want to say they ate meat from a legendary creature?
Vallinish with alcreamy might be dope
Vanilluxe
I think Vanilluxe, Vanillish and Vanillite woul be excellent ice-cream .
YO GUYS LETS GO TO THE MILTANK FARM. WHO WANTS A FEAST
Sandwich guide for dummies
I'm sure someone people would eat lopunny  WAIT DONT SAY IT IS BECAUSE ITS A RABBIT DONT YOU DARE GET THIS TWISTET
KLAWF NOOO… oh wait it can regrow it’s claws, carry on
9:49 *chuckles* i'm in danger
Finneon and Lumineon may taste nice (I have no idea about dex's) and Slowbro and Slowking are just Slowpoke and a Shellder, so a two-for-one
"I'll eat his mom though"- Michael 2022
No balls that Mandjtv would do a smash and pass video of Pokémon.
Gardevoir?
I'd eat klingklang
3:42 Sorry Hindus😐 including me.
3:35 wait that's illegal
The icecream Pokémon
WHAT ABOUT FIDOUGH
Petition to change Miltanks name to Milsteak
I was just expecting 1: gardevoir 2:lopunny 3: vaporeon
How did you forget the ice cream pokemon?
3:52 ah aura guardian flash backs
And where are Vanillite and it's evolutions?
I’ve learn something new today, Pokémon are emergency food :D There could be starve in the Pokémon universe and Ash just eat his pikachu to not die
"I'll eat its mom though!" This is proof we need a No Context MandJTV channel
“I’ll eat his mom though” purplecliffe moment
Surprised no mention of ice cream
Who thought buufalon was Taurus evolution? 👇
Technically speaking, in sword and shield you use burgers, sausage, and slowpoke tails to make curry. And in scarlet and violate you use ham for sandwiches. Where is the meat coming from
I see you making some pumpkin pound cake for breakfast and dessert
Well I'm early
Its confirmed, grunty boi is a wizard!!
Pumpkaboo pie sound good
Need a disclamer i gess
Slurrpuff looks more like a slightly melted Cherry Bakewell cake.
Vegan teacher coming for you 💀
Early tickets here      👇
I am sick but watching you videos always make me feel better
Most vegetarian Texas citizen
"I won't eat Bambi. I'd eat his mom though" 🤣🤣🤣 I am a weak minded individual
I really would like to see a video similar to this but with clothing made from pokemon like lopunny, or leavanny
New editor is good i think ?
PLEASE! Make a Pokémon Sword and Shield nuzlocke. I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU TO DO IT
Mandjtv just mentally preparing for the Vr super realistic version of pokemon legends arceus
Two for one pokemon a jackpot
Apllin is only a worm that is inside a fake apple shell
Watching this video made me realize people eat a lot of weird stuff
I would eat loppuny and gardevoir😏😏😏😏
Fans of Brian David Gilbert's Unraveled series know what the most edible Pokemon is. But I can not burden you with this knowledge!     It's Togepi!
Yo this was a lot shorter than I thought it would be you missed a lot of Pokémon
Mikey you missed the vanilite evo line
What about the vanillish line?
God I love the chaotic energy this video gives off😂
The Rabbits could be nice I you like cooked Rabbit!
Hi Mikey your content is amazing
1:19 kinda funny that Farfetch'd is based on a Japanese saying, "a duck bearing spring onions", which means "easy target" or "golden opportunity".
vanilux
First of all I would add Magikarb for obvious reasons. Secondly probably Arkoos, because I wonder how the God of the Pokemon world would taste
I didn't even notice even after almost 20 years of Ruby and Sapphire being released, that Breloom was basically a mushroom kangaroo. It didn't even click. That is freaking awesome and you really do learn stuff everyday no matter how old you get
Grunty Boi is even more godly than we thought…
Grunty boy is literally a magician
Uhhh
Never new Mikey liked basic b**ch flavored stuff.  I agree with most of your list.
Grungy boi needs to go touch grass sometime soon
You forgot fidough
Makes sense
Hey Mikey
I'd not eat miltank, you don't eat demons, obviously
Noice
The “that’s what I call a pro gamer move” from grunty boy is definitely gonna be memed
To be fair their are people who get attached to farm animals soooooooo Edit: to the “it’s weird we can eat bug repellent” 7:40 that is what capsaicin is.
I am from New Hampshire, and you nailed that Boston accent 👌
"I won't eat Bambi...I'll eat his mom though!" Glad to see you have such honorable standards
Hey Mikey, If you read this, things are going well in the Hisui region for Team Sky, I recruited the bandits, Akari and Beni. Edit: I would eat magikarp because of the presentation in the anime, I looked delicious and I would eat it since I could find it by fishing
I use them to listen to classical music while I write my memoirs!  Damn grunty boi on a whole nother level
Yay! He finally realized that eggecute is actually just seeds
I don't think Malamar'd be any good. After all, if the dark typing of one mon means it's disgusting, what's to say Malamar ain't gross as well?
Weirdly enough I'd be down to try Dragonite and maybe goodra
Caffeine is actually toxic to bugs, so the fact that petilil leaves give you energy and also repels insects makes sense!
PART 2
LET,S PRAY FOR MAGIKARP R.I.P🥺
3:22 enough said
I bet one of scarlet and violet’s pokedex entries on lechonk will say “Lechonk is a prized meat in the paldea region, one slice of lechonk can cost up to 100 poké dollars”
still better than cliff doing smash ir pass with pokemon.
Opinions: Those crabs you mentioned, 100% id eat, exept crabaminibal and klawf, crabaminibal seems to hairy and klawf looks way to tough, i am a vegetarian so the meats are off the table, but id be down for some seafood, and for the veggies id say sure, but im not a fan of pumpkin, as for the squids and oysters, im not a fan of those, ive never tried eel before, i wouldnt do the cotton candy dogs or alcremie because they’re to cute. Some aditions i’d make would be adding combees honey, its ligit just honey. So there, my opinions (Srry that its long)
R.i.p Miltank
Geez, what is Mikey's beef with Miltank?
I would eat a maractus cuz ive always wondered what cactus tastes like
Mikey, Klawf is a rock, that's not edible.
NO MAGIKARP???
Signature dish in Miltank farm: Smoked Miltank Panini
Grunty boi is becoming a gamer, writing memoirs and can do magic. He's becoming too powerful
I really want to eat the apple dragons is it meat or fruit though?
Mikey: “i’m not gonna eat Bambi” Me: “Good, I freakin love Deerling” Mikey: “ i’ll eat his mom though“ Me: 😂💀
John Michael cup finale this weekend who’s team are you on
HE IS MAGICK
Hey Mikey,you forgot vanilite line.
You do realize that if you ate miltank for every meal it would register to The farmers that will take me is really popular and therefore they will bring more miltank and you eating a lot of miltank will actually make more miltank happen
Shuckle is a walking wine cellar if you think about it
Pumpkin spice spam and Oreo’s are real
I wanna eat a Kubchu.
mike lookin' like captain america with that BeArD, no offence it looks good on ya!
Bro grunty boy is wrong grass is red
9:42 Don't forget the seeds! The seeds can actually be consumed after salt curing it and having it dry out in the sun for a tasty snack! Kinda like eating a peanut once you deshell the seed
WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE UNFEZANT
Am I the only one who doesn't hate Miltank? 😅😅😅
Who's not surprised as well that Mikey would eat Milktank?
Mikey: I'm not going to eat deerling cause it's Bambi. Also Mikey: But I will eat his mom though.  Well...now we know who killed Bambi's mom
Appletun sounds like it would have an amazing apple/honey glaze for meats. Now im hungry again.
ye 16mins
If I see Lopunny in this video I am suing
Pumpkaboo and I have SO much in common. It sings joyfully when its prey suffers, and I would sing joyfully when I have it IN MA BELLY .
wat am i watching. but can i eat miltanks pls
"im not gonna eat bambi i'll eat his mom though"
The titles are getting out of hand 🗿🗿🗿
As someone who works with mushrooms Morells and Shiitakes are quite safe to eat! Come visit the mushroom capital of the world and I'll prepare some for you!  Also the moment Klawf was revealed, I instantly went to the store and bought some crab to make crab cakes.  Also Clauncher would be so delicious. Great appetizer
I still want to try Porygon and Dragonite/Dragonair.  Porygon looks like it'd taste like rock candy and Dragonite just looks appetizibg
2:35 what about miltank
I think he found a cookbook in hisui
Grunty boi is GETTING LAID AND KNOWS MAGIC then man can’t stop
Mikey what type do you think farfirg should be psychic dragon or normal dragon I know it already has a type but i think it should at least be dragon
Fire type Pokémon would be very spicy to eat
I was honestly half expecting gardevoir on the list
now I can see mandjtv after the video asking grunty boy to steal something for him, Whitney's miltank. if someone can make a comic of this for pokemon meme review please do.
Gimme some of those krabby klaws please.😊
I feel like I’m the only person that actually likes Unfezant as a Pokémon. It not my favorite but I do like it.
"If I had a nickle for every time Mikey made a video about consuming fantasy creatures. I'd have to nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice"
It's interesting how you mentioned the pokemon-human relationship part, since modern day pokemon doesn't have as many references to eating pokemon (at least not where the pokemon dies, but you do have to wonder where those sausages came from) more than likely because they basically made the pokemon sentient creatures, making them unethical to eat, and also probably the idea of people keeping them as pets adds that taboo into it.   Then again, I'm a "meat is meat" kinda guy, so as long as I don't see it being made I'd dig in
Hai Michael i am your fans form indonesia
Honestly if I was ever in the world of Pokemon I'd prefer to eat just berries instead of pokemon and I'm not a vegan though, also we finally got a part two. ✨
I would eat the plant ones. Mass extinction for grass types.
Hello there
lol
367th
The vegan teacher is after you now
I am gonna tell you a secret  Read more
amateur, i have my own evil team dedicated to eating pokemon. your pokedex is gotta catch em all? mine is gotta taste em all
This made me hungry
Some Vegans probably crying rn😂
Keep up the great content
I wouldn't mind eatting them but imagine the people who  have to kill them because remember pokemon are not animals there more human because there self aware so them suffering would be extacty the same if you were killing a human for meat
I had the headphones in the first place because some bastard at the hideout stole my everyday earbuds
Why is it so weird that people in the Pokemon world eat Pokemon? People IRL love their pets and still eat food as well.
Would you try pumpkin chip cookies
Plus Slowpoke tails grow back so basically what you have is an aloof Pokémon which won’t feel much if at all any pain with an endless supply of tail meat that’ll grow back… and Slowpoke themselves won’t mind 😅
It’s a good day when Mikey uploads! Love the content Mikey!
As much as love sweets, I can never eat Alcreamie or Fidough. They are too cute. 🥰
Petition to bring back the Pokémon Types: Then vs. Now videos
As someone who has raised chickens in the past, the issue with Torchic isn't size(its roughly the same size as a chicken), it is proportion, dang head is way too large.
Mikey please continue the Pokemon Then vs Now series
Should I be the first to say "AYOO WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?!?!" Yea, why not. AYOO WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?!?!
5:22 just him saying grass is blue is very funny :)
3:23 💀
Pumpkin fried chicken
Honestly I would eat gardevoir or lopunny
I would sing joyfully while watching them get eaten
I'm glad Mikey is remaking some of his older videos in a better way, no offense to his older videos
WORRY ABOUT THE SURVIVAL OF YOUR SPECIES. IT’S NOT WINE IT’S JUICE. SO IF I LOOKED AT A STILL STATUE I WOULD HEAR IT. RUDE.  HERE’S WHAT I WOULD EAT, LIST BELOW.
Did anyone else laugh out loud when he said he’d eat combuskin (think about it)
While I am commenting this no one has watched the full video
Miltanks dead to me
love your vids
same
Hoothoot is 44 lbs!
1st 100%
The first part of this video was my first time watching him
3:20 so he is the one who did it
Damn. How long has it been since the last video regarding every Pokémon Mikey would eat?
I would eat grumpig if i could but unfortunately i am allergic to it 😭
This was a good video! By the way I can understand Unfezant being lame, but (hot take) I think Pidgeot is lamer because I believe it's design is pretty bland.
Who knows maybe slowpoke tail really is worth the 1,000,000 PokéDollars that guy in Johto was offering it for (or at least the 9,800)
Some human eat other humans and humans most of time are friend with other humans and humans don't taste that bad
I just want to make my team sky squad in this new region
Grunty boy is a wizard  With means  He'll die of 1d4 damage
I’m EARLY YAY
At one point, Shuckle could turn the Berry Juice into Rare Candies.  I’ve always been curious what a Rare Candy would taste like.
326
This was very out of the blue.
Lol I've never been this esrly
8 minutes ago
He loves Mamoswine, you love Drowsey.
Imagine thinking grass is blue it’s obviously red
"I'll eat his mom though" is not a phrase I thought I'd hear Mikey say. Clearly, he's learned from Zach Wilson on eating Moms
I would eat up miltank 100% 😊
I can't remember what grass is like it's blue right?? Lol
7:00 amoongus?
Thumbnail instantly sold me
This makes me hungry😢
I'll eat miltank burger taco with any fish pokemon caviar you call it
I cant seem to remember what grass is like its blue right:   Me atleast once a week
Alternate title: Pokemon I would use as ingredients in picnics in Scar,et and Violet
Grunty Boi became a physic type
5:22 Grunty Boi doesn't touch grass
HE DID THE TOUCH GRASS THING YES
Drowzee would be alright 👀
That grass.
I saw this and thought ok mikey
Sheeeshhhhhhh ima eat amoomgus
I like calamari, so I would try octillery
Honestly not a bad idea to turn Miltank into a hamburger... or ribs... mmm
Grunty boi has betrayed photosynthesis
Grunty Boi is canonically a wizard
Mikey you shout make a grunty boy compalaition
0:19 Oh boy
Now that's a lotta meats. Try going to a Von Hansen's Meats.
Ah........so it's come to this for content...........oh dear lord.......  Always here for the content Mikey!!
I’m not gonna eat Bambi… his mom though… that’s a different story
Hi Mikey!!
Hay Mickey
mmm mommymilkr
Ah milk tank yummy
For me: Farfetch All duck pokemon  All pig pokemon (I don't think the mamoswine line counts) Stantler (I wouldn't eat sawbuck though) was  Milktank Bidoof (I don't like it) Tropius All seafood pokemon except for fish, I don't like fish. The squid pokemon too. And I think that's it. The other fruit pokemon are too cute to eat. I wouldn't eat the food pokemon but I might sample some of the cream it makes.
yep people are gonna take the ill eat bambi's mom joke out of context
I'm your first viewer on this
Hehehe
Steak?
i got here pretty early great video and now you made me hungry
“pro gamer” lol
Bacon🤩
Ah I remember the old top tens out there. I do have to wonder how good slowpoke tail is. They look really meaty.
Milktank=bergers
I would eat Drowzee to spite you
Aa a vegetarian watching this i am very disappointed
The thumbnail caught me off guard 🤣🤣
I saw the miltank steak 🥩 I had to click on this video
3:23 That's what he said...
First
"pokemon parts or substancews"
First
Oh wow a couple seconds ago 😳

You'll never ever say that you'll drink shuckle's juice if you watch the jhoto anime🤣
I GOT HERE AFTER 2 MINUTES POSTED

Didn't you already make a video about pokemon you would eat a few years back?
Lol I was watching dhmis the series 2022 episode 1 at the lasagna joke but then this vid came out so ye here I am
There is a 100% change that pokemon vegans exist
Hello

I officialy confirm that this video is the most weirdest video on Mikey's channel.

Hi
I would eat some on the list…most of them
Cant wait to see the video!
I would probably eat magikarp and slow pokes tail, I’m hungry    edit: nevermind all of the Pokemon on this list
I'd eat miltank
GREETINGS POKEFANS MICKY HERE(and yes yo name is spelled wrong)
HEY EVERYONE ILL SHOW TODAY WHICH POKÉMON I’D EAT!
Nahhhh, jit trippin
Oh god this dark…..humour
Heheb
magikarp flambe would not work because its more bone than fish (the anime is my source)
I saw the title so suddenly and it had me rolling
I swear If anyone say they would eat Vaporeon/Gardevoire/Lopunny
I immediately knew Miltank was gonna be on here
Amazing content keep it up
Hi
I am first but anyway good video
Greetings Pokefans
Like your vid 😊
W RIZZ
We finally got pt 2! 🎉
Oh ok nice!

This is a really weird video title for me to see while I've been anticipating a Bellibolt reaction video of some sort 😅

Hi

Hi 🎉
Miltank would be a VERY delicious steak… 😋
Hold on wasn't this an old video?
Is drowzee one?
Video Idea: Pokémon that Should've got a Regional Variant
Honestly agree
I have never clicked on a notification faster
WHAT
Weirdest notification ever received in my life ✋😭
Hi
I've never clicked on a video so fast after reading the title (and I'm sure it's the same for many other viewers here)      I wonder what that says about us 😐
I just got my notification of this post!
I did not expect this vid
I agree with this. There are definitely pokemon I would eat out of pure spite.
Lol this vid
Updated previous video love to see it

YOOOO I'M EARLY TO AN MandJTV VID
I agree with mikey

You already make a video like that
I’m disgusted
I saw a dead miltank and clicked on the video 🤣🤣
Didn't you already so this?
Mmmmmm steamed miltank
What a comeback………..WAIT WHY COMBUSKEN
Yo
What
MICHEAL NO
I'm your biggest fan
It’s a dark video especially given how these are living Pokémon, but however the taste my just be worth it
ok honetly  The miltank in the thumbnail looks tasty
I'd eat miltank, hopefully to drive it to extinction
Hi micheal
mmm, i would eat a lucario
Muk pudding
hi
Hi
bhery tasty
Chansey just be saying: would you like an egg in your trying time xD
Technically any Pokémon with a physical body would be edible
6:20 Yum. Oh boy.
Same
Why
40 second gang
Oooh. Early! First time!
Just from the title I know this is going to be interesting.
This notification I got was goofy
Imagine saying lopunny
