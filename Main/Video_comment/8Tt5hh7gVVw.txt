So I watched the first video and all I could think about was..oh these are nice compared to one I stayed at and sure enough number 2 video 1st hotel is the exact same one I stayed at in Albuquerque.  I had half a shower curtain. The mirror was in half, the carpet was ripped away, the bed tilted when sat on. There was no sheets no pillows. One towel and when I asked the front dest for a few more I was told they only had enough for 1 per room.
It’s mean to be lankeybox
Where is your dad??????
9:45 not sure, but i Think i’ve been there

You're saying it wrong, it is not MEGABYTES per second, it is MEGABITS per second. 2 Megabytes p/s is actually sufficient for most internet use, even decent video. 2MBps is the same as 16Mbps. Mbps is what service providers like to use when they talk about internet speed because 16Mbps sounds better than 2MBps. Sadly the vast majority of people say megabytes, which is incorrect. When people say they get 100 megabytes p/s for their home service they are mistaken, as 100MBps is actually 800Mbps.
the hotel in detroit looks like the overlook
UpS TrUcKKK😂😂😂😂😂
Good thing I’m not there) why are you there testing it can be bad
Stud finder got me 😂😂😂
Thanks for making this content.

I feel trayhan at the second hotel, I have the exact opposite of the fear of tight spaces.. and.. long and weird hallways
I feeel like the “hotel staff” trying to break into that ladies room was not hotel staff. Lol. More like someone who’s seen her at the hotel and decided to try breaking-in in the middle of the for lord knows what… that’s terrifying. But not the hotels fault.
The ghost in room 115 Ayo the f are you doing
Yesss.
Wow the hotel philips looks fancy
Maybe if it took the money from you might get kicked out
No ants
How do u get a lot of money 😂

14:14 my friends name is Ellie and she’s dating a girl named Rebecca.. HOW THE HECK-
Calling it a dump is a insult to dumps😂
Ryan without the beard is so scary 😭😭😭
15:41 Ryan says so this hotel is haunted right? The way that Vanity responds with it sure is makes me feel like they do not care how their hotel is haunted
Love ur vids❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Look at his hair at the last hotel while hes eating its a heart
Why dont you reverse it and do 5 star hotels but you have to rate them 1 star
Guess what Ryan I tried your candy the strawberry twists joyride
㊙️🈲㊗️㊗️
Laughed so hard at "and Rebecca"🤣🤣🤣

16:09 BUTCHER VANITY-
Hotel 1 is like the motel from midnight hotel in roblox
I’ve stayed in some of the worst hotels in Vegas and nothing will ever beat the Ramada in  Marietta Georgia. No locks on the door and someone got stabbed while I was there I sat with a pair of scissors in bed praying I finally gave in when the police knocked on my door to tell me what happened. I took the L on the room found a Hampton inn they were so nice they gave me half off because of what I went through  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for Hampton Inns. The Ramada has been permanently closed down thank goodness
wait, saint regis is an extremely good hotel in italy thoigh
I don't know if we have Joyrides in England?
The only ghost I'm okay with is : Casper 👻
It sure is HAUNTED 🎶 * bye hotel * 🏨👋😅
Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore 😂
"which way to Alberquecue ?" Quote from bugs bunny
1 Year Update from ABQ - That motel 6 no longer exists because of the crime. The government literally had to tear it down
hi Ryan
The watermelon joyride made me throw up 27:26
118$ is NOT inexpensive. Now i get why they don't have any customers
i love watching your videos🤩
That's true. The ghosts show the static electric.
bro  go  439
Lol he should stay 3 nights in each hotel in DIFFERENT rooms. He can't actually think one night in one room is gonna truly see what the people saw when they did their review.
Omg I live at Albuquerque 😲
He's using a stud finder 😂😂😂
I’m buying joyride ❤❤ but I never did before  🥀🥀
Breast milk in the fridge? Groooossss
12:45
What do you mean again?
22:43 Yup I read it : the devil is in the details . 'Magnolia'? More like : 'Carnivorous Plant'.  🪰
16:45 Shut UP ! Do u think they have a bunch of rooms that have 511 on the doors just to attract people with a death wish , weirdos & sleeping disorders?
16:18 Ok it's a portal to yesteryear. No wonder people died there . They can stay there too . I'm not going. I can wipe my own butt .
12:16 That sigh ... Existential crisis. Dude is so sick of his life that's all he's got left . 'Been there ! 🕳️
2:18 Funniest comment EVER ? I'm laughing bc I believe it ! 😮😂
😂 I stayed at a round monolithic stone hotel in Africa. I swear Moses met Tarzan there. I got there in a dug out tree canoe. No electricity, I've never been happier to have packed candles , earth floor in the room , planks of wood & mattress , mosquito net : punch line : I had to ask for a door ! No hinges, huge, heavy , 3 men carried it & I had to use a plank of wood to barricade myself from the inside by hanging it on iron right angle holders from the inside. Put sleeping bag on mattress.  Scary , fun , one for the grandkids when I get some 😂❤
I am watching this on a treadmill……..it’s fun
Oh hello my name is Eilish and l love your videos and I'm subcribed to your videos and l liked this video so no need to ask and l want you to keep making more

Motel six kinda like motel in Brookhaven 💀
9:46 Genuinely thought this was the sound of a fire alarm for a second. Its probably something with.. maybe the boiler room if the hotel even has one? I know my dad has been working as a technician for years on end and I faintly remember the boiler room making this sound
How much money do you have?
THAT IS A STUD FINDER RYAN
11:44 Or it might be a 90s TV
Oh

16:08 butcher vanity ref
14:59 did the ghost wipe ur butt got me rolling to andromeda😂😂😂
Go to haunted hotels across  north America
Ghost!!!!!
I don’t think getting the expensive rooms in the one star hotel is what people are getting when they rate it.
In the UK you find hairs in the bed at 4 star hotels so yeah
18:18 bro where’s ur bible ? If I was there I would be praying to Jesus
Bro had a stud finder
“Good news Daryl” made me cackle
16:07 pov: they say ur hungers a problem

0:53 JASON G? OMG. RYAN YOU HAVE TO RUN, I CANT SAY MUCH BUT YOU HAVE TO RUN

Ryan: Asks for Medium... says he asked for medium rare... gets rare... Still happy.
Hey Ryan, I got some joyride today but I can’t post a video with it cus I already ate it all- but it’s so good!!
/fill ~-16 ~ ~-16 ~16 ~16 ~16 air
I liked hotel Phillips looked very interesting. I stayed in a Magnolia Hotel in Dallas TX and it was incredible. The Magnolia definitely looks awesome. Think the one stars there might be overdoing it a lot!
Hahahahhaahhahahaahhahaah ben bombardino crocodilo
22:03 I think Ann had the worst experience lol
“IT SURE IS!!!!”
Vanity was very nice
Love that security guards response
Beep BeEP BusTeD
There's an ant on the wall tho 11:45
vanity was nice
the crossing the street to have to come back and get the tripod multiple times is actually wild lol
❤❤
I also worked at haunted hotel for about 18 months. It had a restaurant and movie theater. I was the theatre assistant manager... I didnt have any issues going anywhere in that giant building, even the basement at midnight was totally fine... but that theater after closing... lets just say I left the door open while vacuuming... something about it just felt weird... it just gave me the creeps to be in there alone at night.
0:06 Steph C: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “toilet was haunted”
Under one hear gang:)
I love how this video summoned everyone from Albuquerque. As a Californian, Albuquerque sounds like such a vibrant city, pew pew!
The way he was using a stud finder and not a ghost tool 😂😂
11:02 “LETS SEE IF THERES BREASTMILK IN THE FRIIIDGE”

I love your videos!!
MY EYES😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭 17:57
7:11 I was kinda happy when I found out one of my fav yt went to my home state!
If you think Crys’s review is bad, check out Kimberly W’s (Hotel Phillips)  Reserved 5 rooms for a tradeshow for staff. Out of the 5, only three stayed, with good reason. The hotel was dirty, dingy and horribly taken care of. For the price we paid and being a Hilton Honors patron, I was dismayed. One room had dust and debris on the headboard of the bed, as well as spatters of blood on the bed and phone. The closet contained items from past residents. Another staffer tried to shower, only to have the water up to her calves and a hidden hole that flooded her room while showering. Another staffer showed up only to be told she had no reservation - although confirmed and reconfirmed. Sent an incident report to Hilton parent, as I am sure they are unaware that their brand name is attached to such an atrocity. Horrible.
I forced my mom if we could go there because in August my grandparents me and my parents go down state for something called The Dream Cruise on Woodward so I asked her if we could stay there and she said maybe oh and by the way I mean the one in Detroit Michigan
In Detroit I was staying at this hotel with my grandparents and my parents and we went in there because well we didn't have enough money for an Airbnb for 3 nights so we end up staying at a hotel and ummmmmmm there was a there wasn't no bug beds when we check the room but when I was laying down on the bed my body started to burn and I was having an allergic reaction to a bed bug
Toilet is haunted 🤣🚽🤣🚽🤣🚽🤣🚽🤣🚽🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️
You should try OYO Hotel Houston Katy Freeway i heard theres alot of bad bad reviews and one review meant that someones boyfriend got KILLED and there was gunshots i dont want u to be dead cuz im a fan of you so if u do u can go if u dont u dont
15:31 bro was walking away from his camera that he needs to grab
I love how he was so excited to head to his room and then looked at the room number, you know it almost feels like they know he read about it and the reviews…😅
THE LAST ONE IS A FREAKING HOUSE😂
Ryan Motel6 got knocked down
Oo
I’ve stayed in Omaha many times and another city in Nebraska that was pretty nice was kearney
Maybe you have to poop 💩
Hey @Ryan Trahan
I love your videos 21:56 can you come and visit me?
0:26 The only thing more spooky than the 1-star hotel is his spelling of Albuquerque.
Nicee now maybe I can try to survive here 😅
what song do you use during 1 star showoff thing
2 megabytes per second is nothing compared to mine. *12 MEGABYTES PER SECOND. YOU HEARD ME.*
I stayed at Motel 6 in Kissimmee Fl. Highly recommend.
The last scene with the cookies, was so sweet😊❤ 2 cool men! And the last statement on the Kung-fu Panda movies 🤣💕 Soo funny😅
Exist on a actual electrical generator.  Static is ghosts.   How did we invent cellphones. like anything? How is mankind that stupid AND that smart.   Im out
That Motel 6 in Albuquerque has been recently demolished due to its dangerous conditions.
Your the best YouTuber❤
3:57 2 way peep hole ig 🤷‍♀️
As an Omaha resident I’m glad you enjoyed yourself. You should have tried to sell your candy at Hollywood candy in the downtown of Omaha.

Thank you for making videos! our family usually watches youtube and its mostly you and one other creator, but we like your content better as you keep it more family friendly. so, again thank you ryan ! ^w^

I just looked it up 511 is the most haunted room 17:13
I live a hour away from the 2nd place 8:02
What a nice hotel house!
He was going to risk his life for this video.

You make the most best video
“backrooms of detroit” 😭🙏🙏🙏💀💀🙏💀🙏🙏
Love from Omaha♥️
Nah the ghost said like and sub

😅kjhtr4&bhh idk what to say
Hotel Phillips that receptionist was so nice😂 She actually thought you were doing paranormal investigation that’s why she gave you room 511. So sweet😂
My first name is Halley
0:51 Jason Grace reference???!!! 😜😜😜 (Jason Grace is a character from the book series Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordan)
That motel 6 in Albuquerque has been permanently closed down bro.
I’m crying laughing at seeing Hotel Phillips in this video. I live in KC. However, I like staying in hotels sometimes if I’m having house work done or something since I’m not a fan of staying with others. I’ve stayed there… a few times. Definitely my least favorite experience I’ve had among the “”better”” hotels.
28:08 heck yes best offer ever
love this! def would not go to room 511❤❤❤❤👩‍❤‍👩👩‍❤‍👩♥♥♥
Hilarious! These are the funniest videos I have watched besides The Secrets of Minecraft, and Garrot the Carrot
All these hotel scores look accurate. Rundown rooms, dirty, poorly maintained, umm ya that’s a 1.5 star. Ryan be like “It had a bed and I wasn’t murdered soo 5 stars.”
Bro can you put joyride in every store in the world cuz i ain't in usa and i wanna try it
As someone who used to work at a trashy hotel in Albuquerque I can tell you, you most likely lucked out and got a good room (by that hotels standards).
@samandcolby  ahh hotel ✨✌🏽
why do you call Frans a she? thats a males name!
24:24 deadass thought whatever was in the room was so bad you went back to the lobby lmfao
He got so mad at Ryan but could say nothing lol 😆 12:15
16:08 they say my hungers a problem
blud tryna find ghost using a stud finder😭
Vanity makes Mary Poppins look like the Grinch.
27:15
I've stayed at that motel 6 in Albuquerque. There was a man passed out on the stairs with a needle in his arm and SWAT was called in the middle of the night at some point. There were bullet holes in the room and some blood in the bathroom. We decided to sleep in the car instead on the side of the desert than stay there for the night 😅 couldn't get a refund either.
hotel2 has a meme?!
Bro was in the backrooms in the 2😂😂😂😂
22:43 95% of hotels need a card for a deposit at check in. Don’t be dumb and give a fucking debit card for the deposit/hold, ever. ALWAYS credit. No worries about overdrafts, and much easier to dispute.
16:08   they say my hitbox's a problem
21:00 when i tell you i died of laughter, i died of laughter😂 not bro sleep talking
Joyride<!🎉
I love how positive Ryan is - like this man will be walking through bed bug hell and be like 'roomates!' W

Hi
To see this now after the motel 6 got knocked down is crazy
Oh, you came to KC. Hotel Phillips... work near there. Holding my breath as your review just started.
I think nothing scary happens because they know he's Ryan Trahan and he's going to give away the ghost😂😂
"devices went missing" ... i don't know if abandoning a camera in the hallways is the best test
I have ants in my house

Akhirnya bisa jalan” gegara ryan😂

Hwlo ryan I love joyride
I genuinely want to face palm myself because of how stupid you were buying a stud finder thinking it was ghost hunting gear
Ryan you know reviews are for making the place better so the staff read them and fix their problems so the next person doesn't say the same thing. Also, when were those reviews made?
Sen Türk müsün 0:11

Happy late Easter🎉❤ I got some joyride as my candy it’s so good❤❤❤
JOY RIDE 12:28  from dandy world???
joyride? ohh i know what other joyride.. *dandys world player once said*
Ryan...I researched room 511 for Hotel Phillips and it said: Room 511 is a 2016 horror film, not a room at the Hotel Phillips. The Hotel Phillips is a historic hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, and doesn't have a room numbered 511. It has a total of 217 rooms, located on 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. The film "Room 511" is about a road trip where two men stay in a room known for wild parties, and they encounter unexpected events. ..... I really confused lol
I love Ryan's editor use the roblox oof sound❤ I'm an og player
The second hotel feels like the hotel from 1408.
5:26 Could’ve been the perfect sponsor for joyride
eB is the best words

All these videos remind me of is how happy I am we got a teardop trailer to use as a bed when we travel the country. I stayed is scary places like this where the carpet stained my socks and the bed had stains. Just scary and never again.
theres no 911?🤔🗿
fun fact, all cockroaches can fly, they just don't realize it, just like you, (disclaimer, you are not a cockroach)
English or Spanish?😊
The stud finder was wild
22:44   i’ll sum it up for you   The reviewer had a very bad experience at the Magnolia Hotel, which they say was misrepresented as a “Premier Boutique Hotel.” Key complaints include: 	•	Dirty conditions (mold, mildew, bad smell, discarded food). 	•	No fridge or microwave in the room. 	•	Bed bugs and uncomfortable beds. 	•	Rude and unhelpful staff. 	•	A $100 hold placed on their card for incidentals without warning. 	•	Overdraft issues due to the hold, and no Chase banks in Omaha to fix it quickly. 	•	Delayed refund of the hold. 	•	Unorganized and unprofessional service.  They highly recommend staying elsewhere and praise the Embassy Suites as a much better option.
“I’m going to play with my toys now”😂😂😂😂

You're so hot and cute
I went to hotel three in Missouri and there was nothing wrong

i live near alq so im literally like 1 mile away from alq but just from this video i have gone to this motel 6 with my dad and you were right, the motel employee at the front desk was nice, JUST ONE PROBLEM... NO JOYRIDEEEE!!! i love joyride but they didnt have it :(
I love the woody hat Ryan
Really  something minor the background  move😱
Can you just hurry
The burn on the desk appears to be from a crack pipe
i read all of E.R.T's review and the last sentence: SHAME ON YOU!
16:51 I GASPED WHEN HE SAID THERE WAS AN EXIT RIGHT ACROSS HIS ROOM. In my country, we believe that a room is haunted if it’s near or in front of the emergency exit. (excuse my english it’s not my 1st language) So basically the exit serves as an entrance for the dead spirits. That explains why there are paranormal things happening cuz ghost are partying in that room 😭.
Heh
Ryan, you almost nearly NEVER SEE BED BUGS on the TOP of the sheets. YOU HAVE TO LOOK IN THE CREVICES ALONG THE SIDE OF THE MATTRESS, IN THE NOOKS WHERE THE MATTRESS IS SEWN TOGETHER. FYI BUDDY. I'm scared for you watching this video since you did not look in those places.
I want some of your candy busters
28:30 Jack look like he is dead inside

Hi ryan
Respect for jack
I had to watch it two times to see after you turn off the flashlight a green dot left the screen and then just happened once it happen twice I seen green dots from the hotel, so the hotel is definitely haunted and I know that because I know green dots mean ghost
I had to watch it two times to realize that after you turned off the flashlight, a green dot blew up the air and me and my cousins have experience green dots when we are ghost hunting
Love watching u bro never gets boring
Me when I hear the word joyride: GLISEN

Room 2004is crazy
Imagine if Ryan replied to me
Bro hurt his eyes i think 18:36
The plumbing look like poop
Bro had to chanhe his pants in the 2nd hotel after the elevator
That person that says it’s haunted is joking right
I need yall to understand that reviews (specifically bad ones) usually can’t be trusted.  I’d start believing something once it is mentioned 4 times or more.  Usually a bad review is the result of a disgruntled guest who was not wronged but feels they were.    Ex: at a hotel a guest found a bug in the hallway.  Staff whisked the bug away and scheduled a bug guy.  Guest demands refund for whole stay and hotel can’t do that. Guest checks out and leaves a review about the hotel being “infested”        I can pull 10000s of examples of that type of shit.   In hotels people literally threaten a bad review if they can’t get their way. 😂
They made a Kung Fu a panda part 4?
Saying it’s in Malaysia
Do not go to Danga Bay because they will always charge you 50 rupiah
Never go to a hotel in Malaysia Malays

Hi Ryan I’m a huge fan I just want to let you know you do all of this flying and I haven’t flew once since I was 3😂
BIGGEST FANNNN
POV me when I realize he’s using a stud finder 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have an unfair advantage. The hotel knows you're coming (so it seems) and prepares
Glad you survived Hotel 6 which caters to prostitutes and rents their rooms by the hour - other than that it was great to see that you debunked the rest of the hotels.  Be safe out there Ryan, sometimes I feel that you are a bit naive.  lol
Can you test one star store like warmer I even have something to say a terminal. I hate it. I was take the stairs when I go out lights out. I don’t know what even happened there. It was like one hour. One star

I'm a little late to this video, and i don't know if it has already been said, but I would like to say that's not how you check for bedbugs. Lift the corners of the sheets and mattress pads. Creases and crevices and along seams and such.

Can you go to Da 5 star Hotel To Neseb
The Room has a Blue Chair
Ryan as someone who lives here
also it don’t matter what room you stay in. I went with a group of Christian’s for a christian event called onething 2009 and the haunting followed us. Up until the last night when whatever was haunting us scared the kids in our group and the elders casted away any spirits and demons then it sucked but was still fun for the first 3 nights
I stayed at the hotel Philips when we went to onething 2009! Honestly it was amazing. One girl wrote red rum on the mirror and all our water turned red our 4 day stay. We had to shower down the hall. Also all night we heard hand saws and hammers and also heard the fire alarms go off at random . I ran into professional paranormal investigators casting a show there in the elevator got to tell them about everything. Super cool
"some how there is a ghost in this wall every 18 inches, oh wait this is a stud finder...." 😂😂

it is not sark tank it’s Dr phil
I’m starting to think Ryan has some special vibes that make every place he stays at better.
Kaboom?
No doubt! The hotels probably see his name and go, “Oh, we better roll out the red carpet for this guy!”
😮
..... I.....I LIVE in New Mexico.... R U ACTUALLY SPYING ON PEOPLE!?
Ryan never should have told me to read that
🥲👍
Lmao, I’m pretty sure the fact that he booked the rooms under “Ryan Trahan” has something to do with all these upgrades and good experiences he’s having 😂
The response the security guard gave after Ryan asked where the vending machine was made me laugh so hard. Bro had flashbacks of Joe.
Your room is a freaking house
Hotel 4 in OMAHA, NE Got roasted by ann
Oh hell nahhhhhhh Why is bro saying I almost bought bitcoin in 2011
You should've said when you found the bullet holes in the first hotel ~**  *"Free pencil holders so you do not have to scatter your pencils around!"*  ** ~
Rayan do it again
I have seen that place I live about 2 hours away but I’ve seen it!!❤😮😊
The hotel looks so good but probably worse on the inside
0:16 you lied that it was 5 stars before going to the hotels

9:48 BRO THATS SO CREPPYYYYY
7:08 MY GRAMMY LIVES THERE
i cant really see inside all of the 1 star motel that you video as you are taking it at only a specific angles that make the motel looks at its best.. do know that people will still come to this motel but they need to know how the interior looks like to plan the stay else if they dont know what to expect, they will choose other places that shows more of what to expect.. in my opinion this is not a 1 star hotel, it is better than 1 star and is really good..
Try Knights Inn phx
I don’t normally watch review videos but Ryan makes them fun and enjoyable I don’t know how

YOOO RYAN YOU NEED TO COLLAB WITH VEGAN POWER GAMING AND AVI SKILLS GAMING AND GAME WITH ELLA TO GO TO ALL THE ONE STAR HOTALS
11:49 reminds me of the Shining hotel...
I always think surely there must be worse hotels than these
Frans is a male name usually, not female
5:08 fun fact, those polystyrene/foam food containers have been banned here in Australia for years because of how bad they are for the environment
"Grand Theft Auto mission" hahaha yess
I love the sound effects
9:31 Might Be A DOVER Impulse
"I don't participate in paranormal activity" buddy, that's not how it works 😂 you gonna get a participation trophy, don'tcha worry 😂😂😂

WHO WOULD ACTUALLY READ ERT RATINGS 😭
And plus I get so excited when I hear the word Omaha cause that’s where I live
POV when you first watch this clip Ryan seriously I thought your college brain was better than this. That’s a stud detector. It’s used for building constructions when the renovating to see if there’s any studs/pieces of wood behind that wall. 18:55
I looked up holtel Phillips and it instantly said room 511 and I didn't even type it so I was scared
cool
Do a haunted hotel video
4:24 that's not fire, that hydrogen and helium:D (i will ignore every reply with a "🤓")
The fact you got stuck with 511-
1:47 there is a bird next to ryan
lol i think when the staff at hotel phillps heard  he was there because it was haunted she purposely gave him 511

Guys i have a question ❓ how do you spot bed bugs
You should collaborate with Ben oftheweek he is so funny
Dont get blinded 17:56
please you are my best youtuber

you are amazing
“Toilet was haunted” 😂😂😂 0:06

Like this comment so Ryan says hi
I live in Detroit michigan
that is so dangerous for you why you go to the motel 6 ☠☠
Bro you scared me because the sound thing
14:20 my name is rebecca but i did not do anything😢😐😑      Pls like
The internet is still not as bad as mine😂
Ryan when you check for bedbugs, always bring traps, and lift the corners of the mattress and look there where they hide, look under the pillows and look for blood under the pillows or on the sheets. They hide during the day, but at night they come out to party. Just some advice. I’ve had them before and so I really wouldn’t want you to bring home bed bugs without knowing it, because you won’t until they make a home in yours. The babies look translucent and so you may think they are spiders, no they may be bed bugs. It’s gradual but please be careful. Those things are a nightmare.
Just a reminder, internet speeds are not measured in mega BYTES it's megaBITS, 1/8 of a megabyte.
Love love love your videos Ryan ❤ yes I said it 3 times. SUE ME. 😂 (please don’t. :D) ❤
21:07 the ghost just seems like a chill guy
Ghosts cant Harm you so nothing to worry about 😃
ryan can you send me some joyride sour strips?

7:09 Eminem land
What does everybody think? Does joyride have a new competitor find out in the next video? OK, that’s kind of cringe.
Me and my friend was going to get joyride, but they were out of stock. We were devastated, but we found something called sour strips which I think you have a new competitor.
I went to the second hotel before
Lobe the videos. Keep them coming  1 star 😂
Try the Dakkji again
Love to see that you always have a goal to accomplish in a video 👌🏻 Keeps us motivated as well!

Nice pajamas
My 3 dogs all watched the video, and when it ended they all walked away, wanting more :)
@ryan
i need a hotel that has BREAST MILK inside fridge
Big fan of your snacks and candies  but  may I suggest should make some freeze dry candies. That would be awesome and delicious.
Ryan! I actually live in Albuquerque New Mexico! I live in the South Valley! It would be an honour if you could come back and go to a hotel closer to the South Valley?
14:22  rebecca is hated frfr
I was trying to eat while watching this.  Please don't show us shit-filled toilets, even if you pixelate them a little bit, we can still see what's in there.
omgggg😐😨
Who’s here on 3072?
Any one in 2025
I’m from Detroit and wouldn’t stay at that hotel sorry you’ve experienced this lol …. I’m addicted to your videos and I found them through my kids because they watch you but wayyy better hotels here than that one lol

Kung fu panda is still loading to this day
I'm imagining that they gave you room 511 because you brought up that you've heard it's haunted, and you seemed interested in the haunted bit of the hotel, also because you told then you traveled there to come to hotel and then mentioned you heard it was haunted

View Ryan Trahan+ Food= Happiness
12:16 the security guard was amazing😂
18:11 that’s like leaving $300 dollars on the ground outside of a building then when it’s gone after an hour you declare the building haunted
Fun Fact: The oof sound is used in every ryan trahan video
My family pays 49 for a hotel and they are so good it Look like they are 200
On the review of the Detroit hotel, he was on a gun point
I want a story where you’re in the backrooms now 😂
I saw a big pink thing that was floating and went to room 6 he might haunted you 😰
14:21 my sister Rebecca nice not her twin 😂😂😂 nvm

Hey Ryan can you make a gluten free version of joyride please.
ERT I think you made too many words than a comic book Edit :24:32 I don’t think that’s a hotel I think that’s a freaking mansion
huh
i love it when he goes back to grab his cam it always cracks me up!
27:13 no sir you asked for medium 😅 run it back!😂
Ryan using a stud checker was hilarious
I owe this man so much, single handedly inspired me to create my own very difficult challenges, I doubt I could get as many people to watch me so mine though 😂 seriously thank you so much for the great content.
‏‪17:27‬‏ i will disappear like rn
29:31 MRBEAST
😂 ur so funny even when my dad left me😢
I stayed there before
Soooo essentially everything he had to say about the Detroit hotel made sense 😂😂 I've lived on the outskirts for the majority of my life, and I can tell what he really meant when he was describing that particular hotel
I live in New Mexico and we call it the creak hotel
✨j a m m y   t i m e✨
what was in room 2004
0:06  “toilet was haunted” I bet it’s a chill ghost
Hi I just love your videos 0:53
Yeah dude dont sleep at Door 13, dread spawns there
22:43 bro I actually read it it's basically just them comparing the hotel to another one and how they overcharged them like more than $200 for putting them on hold
8:27 I'm watching this 8 months ago
David from the second hotel sent the review on my birthday
Is he not worried about bringing home bedbugs? Or Hailey worried??? I don’t live anywhere near them and I’m worried. He’s brave for actually climbing in those beds
17:04  stud finder is for ghosts I didn't know that
How did frans L know even tho she's sleeping did the staff broke or steal something I'm confused
Ryan your the best reviewer ever just to know
The toilet review 😂😂😂
I live in Kansas 😁😁😁
8:22 legend says that David is still waiting for his food
3:43 this is the dest bay
You should test five star review places but you have to leave an honest 1 star review
try cecil hotel
bro someone is trying to break in 2:20
My name diego :D
who is too lazy to read that review
How is this video 29 mins it felt like 1 Hour
I'm out of spur strips🤣🤣🤣
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE THUBMNAIL REVIEW IS LITTERALLY ON THE... 17TH MONTH LIKE WHAT
Bro you should try the relax inn in Fort Lauderdale FL, I’m going there in a few weeks with the homies
I live in Michigan
If you come from YouTube your allowed to like this comment
When Ryan smiles he looks like Tom Holland
Legend says David is still waiting
I love New Mexico! All my family lives there!

Apart from the first one, none of these hotels look shady. I remember looking up hotels in LA and omg these were horrible. Maybe you should try there. 😂
11:04 bro wtf💀💀😭😭
what about room 666?
The second is just look like george and the yellow men's hotel
Is that the crystal palace from breaking bad?
4:37 bro is ordering from door dash not Uber eats guy (amir)
2nd hotel , they take your devices and probaly put them in lost property and then if you loose them you can ask the reception
You look like caylus
29:05 where did the window go
it's not 1 star but go to colorado and go to room 217
WHAT THE FUCK MAN LIKE OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH [CRYING]
I’m sorry but medium is def overcooked lol
The motel 6 is the one me and my mom went to when my dad was being a dick. The exact one. I cried when I saw it.  Trauma

@MR BEST
Death or live?
I like how the lady said it sure is when he said is this huanted
@ryan it’s scary
I think it's really obvious why someone tried to enter frans' room in the middle of the night also that first place is horrible and seems really dangerous !
vanity most definitely gave you Rm 511 on purpose
OMG I LIVE 30 MINUTES FROM KANSAS CITY😱😱😱😱 (kansas city is usually horrible depending where you go)
My cousin stayed there and he said that he found a rifle under the bed
If u love Ryan’s videos clap your hands 👏 😂❤
He needs to make a video about him rating 5 star hotels 1 star
I'm getting joy ride
I hate you so much because you have not given me any cool joyride
Why am I watching this while doing popipo dance😊
YOU DO THE MOST CRASYEST VIDEOS
Play the game  fortniet
I bought 20 joyrides ryan
He was like:you just passed it🤦‍♂️ 12:14
It's a F
The "futon room" in the St. Regis,  Detroit is where they occasionally have live entertainment...Guess it does look sus when it's empty 🤭
3:33 my question is where did the bullets enter and leave. Another thought since it’s New Mexico what if they shot the roaches
Top comment please
Joyride is so good
We stayed in a youth hostel for a school trip but not a single one of the toilets had a lock and the one in ours only had a curtin
Why was the fence pulled apart at the start?
You should test five star review hotels
Joyride is the best
look at the clock in 12:30 that's my favorite event
26:10 Not the kung fu panda plushie looking like a martial artsist panda😂😂  Dont hate on me 😅  But can i get some likes😂 👇
0:06 "the toilet was haunted" bro gave 5 stars on that bc he became friends with the ghost E.R.T is now a professional yapper
22:44 dude literally wrote an entire Harry Potter book😭
the elevators in st regis hotel were built by the company that is now known as ThyssenKrupp, the same elevators are in mys chool.

21:53 guys I found Gerry lane
21:18 hahahaha classic. Sleeptalking.
16:47 like you didn’t get that room on purpose. 😂
😊
This has happened to me 20 times why is there so many mistakes in the voice thing why does the voice thing have so much mistakes? There’s probably another word mistake in this. It’s going to ruin the whole sentence that you don’t even know what I said. There’s probably going to be another word mistake and I’m not going to reply if there’s a lot of mistakes, even if it says a bad word, I didn’t put them there
Roommate now I’m saying in bed did not mean who was saying the bad word why are you saying the bad words in my screen?
Did they say balls? I didn’t say boys.
No, not cringe here the boys thing is not working
oops, I said hair I meant charge
I won’t even stay in a hotel unless there’s paranormal benign calcifications in the vending machine
Noice!

ryan, I hate to tell you but you're fancy "wall ghost finder device" is just a stud finder (basically just finds a wooden plank in the wall so you can put a nail in and it will hold). Room 511 isn't confirmed of a wall ghost.😂😂😂😂😂 (edit- oops looks like you figured it out in the next 5 seconds) 👍
BATHROOM = GHOST ON THE SECOND ONE

Vanity is so cool
Hey! I live in Missouri! But just not in Kansas 😅
Ryan you need to go to the Gaylord opry land hotel in Nashville it was hands down the most expensive and worst hotel I’ve ever been to.
I mean my house is haunted. I’ve heard scratching, randomly creaking floorboard, and something telling me things or saying my name and things randomly falling off shelves. But for some reason only in my room🤨🧐🤔😶‍🌫️
i can't taste it I'm live in philipines😢😢
Can you go to the most haunted hotel
awesome video Ryan♥I think your cute tbh with that hair and looks😍
Under 1 year 👇   ❌👇
15:43 "i heard this place was haunted is it? " IT SURE IS🎉🎉 GOT ME DYING 𝙻𝙾𝙻
I live in Missouri
2:10 I am eating...
12:27  JOYRIDE??? *flashback*
I have a pretty big problem with that because it doesn’t have to 😢
Ryan I love the joy ride
My guess on the Motel 6 is that all the fires were from people cooking meth. And how does she know it was the staff trying to break in?  That last hotel room genuinely looked 5 star.
Omg I just got your candy joyride!
You should stay in Haunted hotels
What if they knows
Hey!,Ryan i have an awesome and important and interesting question,that it will even be good enough to say at a speech!,So let’s get straight to the question!,do you like 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑇𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠,if you get to this comment pls reply or answer in a upcoming video!
in kansas the thing you are using is a stud reader it is used to figure out were to put holes in walls so you dont break them
Vanity was a vibe
Detroit team!

Ryan should fill his house with joyride
You should stay in the Black Angus Inn in Alaska. Many drug deals going down there, locals never step foot in it.

You can’t even go outside and touch grass because of you so is her parents shut up and get up YouTube….
24:35 i think ryan is the only guy i've seen too actually use a quote from the wizard of Oz and get his way with it
Two months ago I turned 10 earlier this month the month is December well, anyways matter what I’m saying. I asked my mom if I could get joyride because it was the newest thing she turned me down.😢😂😢
12:15 *insert dramatic inhale and exhale

18:47 THATS A STUD  DETECTOR 😭
If you came here for the hotels like my comment or if you came here for Ryan comment on my comment
The “to that being said cheers” is so iconic 5:24 😂
aye why you didn't come see me i'm from kansas city missouri 😢😂
The haunted story is easily explainable, some person pressed two buttons got out on another floor and then the elevator opened on the lower floor because that was the second button pressed.
2:26 I walk a lonely road
16:27 hehe
my most favourite series
0:49 it looks exactly like the hotel in a haunted Roblox game and at the end of the Roblox game you pull the fence apart

WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT DARRYLS PFP LMAOOOOOO 14:27

I’ve been in the haunted hotel and got a keychain from it
I want two try joyride but my mom does not last me and I do not live in America or the States she does not let me order on amazon
3:15 diego is not the best hes the goat
Lmao I’m pretty sure the fact that he booked the rooms under “Ryan Trahan” has something to do with all these upgrades and good experiences he’s having 😂
When you read out the four haunted rooms I was like- GET ONE OF THOSE ROOMS PLEASE BRO   Edit- YESSS HE GOT ROOM 511
22:43 read it if your bored
Man i like these videos but i stepped into my first motel 6 this year and i was disgusted i paid for another actual hotel down the road lmao. Didnt even ask for a refund or anything it was sketch and i saw the amount of crack heads asking for drugs and constant police trolling the parking lot so i just left
I live in Kansas City in grain valley and that hotel is very nice
I love the story telling 16:05
18:27 Ryan was playing roblox blair IRL 🐢🔥🔥

hi
You should go to 5 star hotels and leave a 1 star review
I want to someday (I’m a cursed introvert) go down in a hotel lobby to also eat milk and cookies
How do you find the hotels like do you just travel and find hotels there or like do you find hotels on the review app then you fly ovet?
Plzzzz come to Farmington nm
I’m from here
the thing that you call "this thing" is to find spots of hollow walls
I love your vids
5 stars. video was good, part of my favorite playlist, extremely entertaining, i saw the ghost of my dog watching. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Over a day people  👇
Looks like twizzlers liqoorice will not try your candy but I do enjoy your videos thanks for sharing both

Hi
Your stake made me hungry D:

Bro at 20:50 OMG TJHAT WAS FUNNY
The Internet of the Ryan is really bad bro the movie
I haven’t bought any joyride
Ryan,let me just say I LOVE ur content really cool but I haven’t gotten any joy ride
Ive been to that motel 6 in Albuquerque. We left shortly after checking in because there were roaches in the bathtub and we needed to give our baby a bath:( Also there were people selling microwaves and coffee makers outside.
I really need to know where Ryan gets his jammies from 5:43, they look comfy
No but honestly the fourth room or the fourth hotel was completely amazing who cares if there was a juice splashes in the paintings cuz honestly what type of hotel has two stories is livable has it looks like a whole entire city has the best view as well I think amazing the service and I don't know how much it cost to but it must be under $200
david waiting 16 months to get his cocacola: *puts -10 stars*
I don't get what I run into your hands I didn't talk about how nice the staff was at the place that was haunted sure it was haunted but at least they're telling you hey this place is paranormal and this is like for YouTubers for trying to look at things or whatever but they were actually pretty nice and the place was pretty big and how much do you say it costed I'm definitely going there someday
Omg she is not going to get any customers
YESS!!!  IMA IS SOO GOOD! great pick for food :)
In room 511
Everyone if you reading this comment it's your lucky day because Ryan Trahan has a secret Chanel called Ryan lol

I RAN TO MY MUM AND COVERD MY EYES
Hey Trahan, I bought the blue raspberry sour strips a few minutes ago at H-E-B we literally got the same ones ❤
Aren’t you wasting your money
Yes Phillips hotel 511 is haunted one guest reported waking up at 3 AM each night to strange sounds and sensations and that multiple hotel staff confirmed that the hotel has had many complaints about ghost
Ryan why do you do this to your self😭
There was something behind you moving when you were sitting at the table with that burned spot and you had your food
I love how he is using a stud detector to try and find ghosts
I think I am blonnfff
How much money did this cost you?😃
My brother is named Ryan..

The first one looks like a um to stay there😂
13 is ghost in Thai if you turn it around you will see ผี  and ผี mean ghost
I accept the trade offer completely
I liked my own video cause nobody will 3:06
When Rayn turned off the lights in the hotel that had blood on the phone, my YouTube turned off and I couldn't access it or Chrome anymore, that was scary.
1=2=100

Vanity seems so nice, like I’d genuinely be friends with her omg. Lmao, anyways great video bossman 💪

You look so much like Tom Holland
4:49 something in the background moved🫢
This place needs God ✝️✝️✝️.  I will never go near that place 🤣🤣🤣.
La habitación 511 es un nivel de backroom
10:41 bruh in showed 4 32 and I am at 4 33 lol
I read that really really long review for the final hotel and the reviewer could have cut out 80% of it. They went on about their personal business life that didn't have anything to do with the hotel and a lot of their review that was applicable was a play-by-play description that you really didn't need to know.
Ryan talking in his sleep "I'm out of sour strip's" got me😂
I just realized maybe people are giving Ryan the nicest rooms so he leaves a good review of their hotel.
Ryan my friend didn't want to give me a little piece of joyride and I live in Italy so it's impossible to get it :(
3:42 “painting in bed” i got news for u buddy 😭
aw man i could of met ryan! :(
My dad just told me that my parents were splitting up but this makes me feel better thank you rayan😊
Im out of sour strips. Got me dying 😂😂😂😂
21:07 how do we know it’s not him just talking in his sleep-
What plane did you fly with
Off? Last One star hotel A last one He was Milk andcookies Likeanta
Ryan!!!!! YOU SHOULD STAY AT THE HOTEL CECIL IN LA!!!!!!
We. got. Joyride
No Ryan it's the other room not your room it's not busted

What the f is this? 😂😂😂😂 22:43
What the f is this?😂😂😂😂
One day  I was in Ryanair and I wametet
Stud finder - awesome!

Imagine if he met Eminem while he was there that would be crazy does he live in Detroit Michigan?
I like how she leaves a five star with you and looks at the positive things not the negative things
I like how she leaves a five star with you and looks at the positive things not the nature goes
Am I the only one who read E.R.Ts message😭😭

15:01 “I’m sorry did the ghost wipe your butt?” Got me dying! 😂
Hey Ryan in either North Carolina or flordia can’t  remember  which one but we waited 3 hours for our food at blue maple but the food was honestly good tho
Near me! Im Scottish😅

“Ambient sirens” - great description of coming up in the ghetto I heard of these kids that moved to my town (very suburban, not me tho lol) That came from the hood somewhere far away. They got genuinely nervous of no gun shots at night, no stabbing near by, no one in school with a gun (that they knew about), and no fights in sight Reason being they felt they knew it’d come any second. That’s a tough mindstate. It was cause they didn’t have awareness to see what could be a threat. Left em in the dark

Diego is the best 😎
B4o looks like Tom Holland 😂😂
I am scared 😢
10:13  backrooms lolllll😂
Man I was feeling rather down lately and idk why but your videos just cheer me up.  You’re always so positive.
I'm pretty much sure that the ghost in hotel Philips were chill with you, so they didn't do anything haunting.
You poop inside the hotel
I was so surprised to see something from my home state Missouri😅😂
Guys i feel a sleep.. for 4 hours
i have no friends so your videos are very comforting

What do u put in ur hair
Room 511 is a room in a horror film from 2016 called Room 511. The film is about two men who stay at a hotel room known for wild parties and encounter two women. They find that the day may never end and that every attempt to leave seems to stall. The film's tagline is "There's a party in Room 511. Anyone can enter, no one can leave".
I'm not generally envious of the life of influencers, but traveling the world the way Ryan does and sampling establishments great and small and getting paid for it seems like a pretty sweet lifestyle.
It sUrE isSSsSSsSs😆 15:43
12:09 the security guard has had ENOUGH😭
16:19 Ryan, it's the literally one thing you must do right away.
can i ask a question are your candy's halal because im muslim 😅

Ohhh I thought they were actually “only one star hotel” on google.  Like every review is only one star.
2:08 did any of you notice the bird?

11:05 LETS SEE IF THERE IS WHAT IN THE FRIDGE??

Joyride is the best candy ever
Joyride it’s the best candy

I think the front desk lady gave you 511 because you said you came there just for the hotel, then asked if it was haunted. That sounds like you wanted a haunted room😭
I think he will die one day😂
I-I have a friend n-name Rebecca.

Hi
Ryan: Hey excuse me do you know where the vending machine is? ……..heh..… Security guard:*Inhale* *exhale*
He should've went up to 1408 and experienced the terrifying hotel room.
That yellow thing that you were using, it’s not for ghost it’s a wall finder to drill screws in🙂‍↕️
I expected Captain Cook and Hiesenberg to show up at your door at Hotel 6.

WAH!!!!! According to Reddit users, hotel staff have shared various stories about Room 511. One staff member mentioned that the room’s security screen would flicker, indicating unusual activity. Another staff member reported encountering a grotesque figure in the room, which was later revealed to be a prank by a group of guests.  Guest Experiences Many guests have reported strange experiences in Room 511, including:  Unusual noises and sounds, such as laughter, whispers, and creaks Doors opening and closing on their own Objects moving or disappearing Unexplained cold spots and drafts Ghostly apparitions or shadowy figures Speakeasy Connection Room 511 is located near the hotel’s hidden speakeasy, which is accessible through a secret door behind the front desk. Guests have reported that the speakeasy is a hub for paranormal activity, with many claiming to have seen ghostly figures and experienced strange occurrences while visiting.  Room 511’s Dark Past While the hotel’s official records do not reveal much about Room 511’s history, online discussions suggest that the room may have a dark past. Some believe that the room was once used for occult rituals or other illicit activities, which could have awakened malevolent spirits.  In Conclusion Hotel Phillips Room 511 has a reputation for being haunted, with numerous reports of paranormal activity from both guests and staff. While the hotel’s official records do not confirm the room’s dark past, online discussions suggest that the room may have a troubled history. If you’re staying at the Hotel Phillips Kansas City and find yourself in Room 511, be prepared for a potentially eerie and unsettling experience.

I just want to say I bought some of your joyride and you have a new customer it was so good
THE DEEP INHALE WHEN HE ASKED FOR THE VENDING MACHINE😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Seeing this guy shower in a bunch of one-star hotels is a little scary because I'm praying to God that he was wearing some form of wet shoes 😭

you can tell he's from texas with the way he says "howdy"
I love it when he goes to my city(omaha nebraska)
No way you went to New Mexico
15:31 Do you actually place your camera there, cross the road, cross the road again to get the camera but edit out the last part?
They gave him room 511 because he went there cause he thought it was haunted so the desk lady gave him a task to complete 😅
And money here in 2024
Thanks for ruining my lunch dude with the picture of that clogged toilet...
hotel phillips looks from home alone 2
every place could use a receptionist like Vanity, people like that lift spirits so fasttttt (pun intended)
Ryan I know you won’t see this but at 18:50 that’s not a ghost hunting weapon. It’s used to see if you can drill safely
0:06 "toilet was haunted💀💀"
why are they so mad over goob not distracting like look at his trinkets…
Vanity seems so sweet and funny! :)
I love vanity she seemed so sweet and funny,
9:37

When the vid was at 10:22 I think all the things he said was true 😢
Pls look at cecil hotel
I like your them song , sounds like a jungle type of vibe 🤓
You asked for medium, she suggested the range, medium rare to medium, probably because that's what the cook should aim for if he doesn't use a thermometer.
That steak is far from overcooked. She must've asked for a medium well or something, expecting a medium, or medium rare.
Oh wait, you're in Nebraska? Well, that's because they have nicer trailers than that there Hotel. I'm serious.
Who's hanging out with your girlfriend? That's what I'd be worried about. She doesn't hang out with you? Ugh, ... rough.
what happened to the security guard
I am in Mexico
I'm diego

BRO THE ROOM ALREADY HAS A BLUE CHAIR😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂

The thumbnail for this video kinda reminds of something Roblox game I can’t put my finger on it…
The flaw in these videos is that the places most likely fixed someof the issues after the reviews were left. Entertaining nonetheless
As someone who lives in Omaha it’s super cool to see you go to all the places I’ve been to and loved and continue to go to somewhat regularly
3:37
WOOOOO KANSAS!!! I live there. That hotel is a bit creepy, but that is most likely because that area is known for crimes at night. Also the haunted vibe may be true but I have no clue. Hope you enjoyed your stay in Kansas City, Missouri!

I can clarify those are most likely not bullet holes. They could be, or they could be someone's bad handiwork at building a bed
That detroit Hotel reminds me of The Worlds Fair Hotel by H.H.Holmes idk why
Ryan: where are the vending machines..? Worker: *sighhhhh*
What the name of this pull up gear? 5:49
Why are there dogs barking outside?
😅🎉❤🎉❤😅🎉
I like it
Less money than my shoes. My shoes were 85, so overpriced.
Just got ur candy at target and it's delicious I can't have pork and red 40 for religious reasons and your candy is perfect for countering those things and significantly healthier thank u 😊.
18:56 those are supposed to help hang something on the wall or drill in the wall to show the frame of the building
The Saint Bridges Hotel is actually a really good hotel
Ryan,how much money do you spend to make these videos😂
I went to target and got some joyride candy. I don't like that kind of candy but my son eats those types of candy. He is always trying to get me to like them but I like skittles better. I couldn't wait for my son to try JoyRide and he did. He tried the blue rasberry and he said it was really tasty but he likes his candy sour.
Why was vanity so excited to tell you where she works is "haunted"
2:19 omg
Hu bru 2:09

هل هذا الفتى مجنون؟؟ يقول أن المراجعات كاذبة أو خاطئة فقط لأنه لم يحدث له ما حدث للأناس الذين ذهبوا إلى تلك المواقع وتركوا تعليقات عن تجاربهم! من الواضح أنه تم الدفع له ليجمّل ويحسن صورة تلك الفنادق الرديئة. هذا ما أكرهه في هذا النوع من الأشخاص، انعدام المصداقية والنزاهة 👎
Launch it in the United Arab Emirates

Don't go
Life is a test, who ever passes the test gains eternal paradise and who ever fail has to rott in eternal hell. Life has a meaning to it we were sent by someone for a purpose life isnt just about living the way you see fit but its more to it then that. We were sent by god and god is testing us by seeing if we follow his rules and regulations we need to follow the rules and god has kept peace and happiness in observing  those rules. There are some compulsory rules. ➡️Accepting that God is the creator of this world and that there is no one like him and we must worship him only. ➡️The second basic rule is to believe that a person came to us to convey all these teachings and to believe that that person was the messenger of God and he is the last messenger and god will not send any other messenger after him. By following these principles and believing in the 2 things mentioned above you will enter heaven surely but these are just the two most main things and without believing you can never enter paradise. There is a lot more to it then this and these to believes are not even 0.1% of the whole thing by following these two steps and by frmly instilling these to beliefs you will surely enter paradise one day. The rules teaches you the way to live and if you want to learn those then you must do research on a the set of principles which are known as Islam. My advice is to accept that there is one god the cretor and ruler of this and to accept that Muhammad is his last messenger(there were messengers before hime as well to guide mankind and save them from hell)and there will not come another messenger after him by doing this you will be safe from the hell fire and if you cant do so due to some family,society,social issues then you can keep this belief to your self and not tell anyone about it and once you do so you can pray to god and ask him for further guidance and he will surely guide you onto the straight,true and just path.
But the last one no way 😳 OMG
Hotel two is jinormus😅

I live  in Albuquerque New Mexico and I can confirm you got lucky. Many of the hotel 6 are awful dirty and just overall unclean. The sirens you heard are for one of the daily gunfight as Abq is a very crime filled city and this state sucks. You are lucky you only had to stay here for one night.

Dude, a sleeping bag is not going to protect you from bed bugs. You need to look up how bed bugs work if you are going to keep staying at places like this and not end up with bed ugs at your house.
isnt 'it motel 6 a location where the series Breaking Bad was filmed? Looks like the motel where Jesse would come in the first season
Ryan:I heard this place is haunted? Vanity:IT SURE IS! 😄
22:44 I read the whole thing and I was gonna put it in short so no one has to read it but there’s too much to even say it. Basically they put their card on hold 2x the hotel is musty idek
cool
That security guard sounded sooo DONE with that question
That security guard sounded sooo DONE with that question

I would never take my shoes off in ANY hotel room. gross. I wear flip flops in the shower.
the flying roaches are a lot better than those little ones...
if hotel staff is trying to get into your room, knowing you're in there, and you're holding the door so they can't force their way in.... someone's trying to get you man. that person is LUCKY.
This is gonna. Get me nightmares…
I love Nima 😐

Five stars, nice video. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 22:44 I read all of this, ERT is definitely mad
That was a huge steak and many fries. At least 1500 calories. Must've not ate that day.
That room ain't worth $118. Can do a lot better than that.
i guess im the only one who read the thumbnail as "dont sleep with me, im 13" 😭😭
So you have the luxurious job of traveling...but have to stay at the worst hotels in the country loll

What happened to the clock? i’m scared.😢
I think vanity was losing her sanity after that event.
That's barely a door 😭
Ups truck! 14:00
Do anyone know What rating app he uses?
ima assume that the place was in fact burning and the hotel staff tried to save frans. and for the smell n stuff is also because the place is burning. It also burned down the plumbing system and make the cockroaches try to escape.
I remember sleeping at this one hotel where you had to check in on a computer yourself. There was no staff, and you had to grab the room keys yourself
At 0:59 Jason G is me
Albuquerque locals here 👇🏽
10:35 this one literally went from *nice place, like really nice* *some random school hallway* *literal backrooms*
I like your reviews...but Please get a hand free mic. ! It's distracting and would help you out!

If you need a suggestion do the Dolphin Run in VA beach, roaches, ants everywhere (including in beds), stained comforter, and sand everywhere, I could here my neighbors yelling at each other and dogs barking ( dogs are not aloud ), worst hotel I’ve ever been to
15:42 OK but her vibes who cares about the haunted hotel her vibes they’re just amazing
As someone who lives in Kansas City Missouri, this hotel is 100% definitely haunted.
L Magnolia
3:48 thank goodness Ryan I was terrified that there was monsters under there
On the second to last hotel that recording made me almost click off the vid and be scared for the rest of the night
19:02 there could be some sort of electro magnetic field on that wall, I don’t know why, but there could be especially since it’s in one place, and its spans all the way across

“i’m gonna leave a device on my front door” *casually puts a $6K camera*
I bet the fire stain was probably from someone smoking crack in the room. 😅. Unfortunately Motel 6 doesn’t have “Do Not Disturb” signs but they really should.
… 6:30
I wanna know what the security guard said about the vending machine
A hotel 6 I went to had black sticky goop in the carpets and my grandfathers room had a bed that smelled like pis

1:42 they needed the iPhone charger
22:43 Sheesh ERT sure does have a grudge on that hotel 💀💀💀
Nah fuck that, that first one didnt have the latch/extra lock bc its def been raided and they def found trafficking there, its a hot spot so PDs will take them off if its too constant.
I wouldn't make it a night in any of these.
The clincher for making Omaha 1-star was the bottle of A1 with the steak.

When you do these reviews can you also check if there's hidden cameras? They look like the kind of places that would do that
@CommentGuard717 ok

That last one is literally a house
7:34
I have stayed at the Hotel Phillips and it is for sure haunted
I cant wait for joyride to come to africa 😋
i
I moved to the Detroit area about 2 years ago now. Detroit is an interesting city because some parts are really nice now, others are still not, and there's a few like that hotel, where they're somewhere in between. They seem superficially nice but you can tell they're trying really hard to move forward. I think Detroit is actually a great city overall, you just need to know which places to avoid, and they're pretty obvious. I think nothing explains Detroit better than the Zillow listings. You have $5000 dollar house and $5000000 houses all listed as "Detroit, MI."
Bro I just smile when I see this man
bro, use atleast HOLYLARK M2 wireless lav. 😊
For 118 a night I expect more lmao. That's expensive.
The way you spelt Albuquerque 😅 Ohhhh edit MY NAME IS ALSO VANITY!
thanks for 100 subscribers
“You can’t compare it to a five star hotel.” That’s literally how rating works Ryan-you give it a score of 1-5 Haley might want to see this… 💀  *bed bug flashbacks* The Detroit one also teaches a lesson: not everything beautiful on the outside is beautiful on the inside “The bus is out of service, why is it out of service?” Big kids UNITE 🤚 You just need to do Hotel Cecil now Ryan
As a RN, just curious why your pupils are pinpointed? Opioids?…. Not judging, just observing. ☮️
The stud finder bit was top tier.
Crazy I was crazy once they looked me in a room a rubber room a rubber room with rats the rats make me crazy
Stud finder goes crazy
i remember staying at a motel 6 for a softball tournament when i was younger and i didn't want to go to sleep that night. i eventually did, but my father woke my mother (woke up bc of the noise) and i up in the middle of the night because one of the staff was jiggling the door trying to get in 😭 we checked out and stayed at a different hotel but man, yikes. this is on the east coast too, nowhere new NM
OMG! at 21:44 in the video if u look at the hotel name it’s called “magnolia” and that’s my name!
YO MY BROTHER GOES TO WAYNE STATE AND UR RIGHT THERE IT SAIS WARRIOR STRONG W

Roblox OOF sound at 13:32
If you go to a Motel that has a history of broken doors run away because there might have been a dead body in there once. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a dead body hiding in that Motel.

Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.  This is the promise of Jesus. The world has been getting more evil by the day. Jesus doesn’t hate you. He loves you. But you can only take advantage of that patience for so long. Our Lord is coming back with a sword. Turn to Him and be set free.
I Love your vids they make me laugh 😂

dont read the description...
R7ryj hfdaohvasrizz
Im going to guess that the kinda freaky hotel with a nice lobby as two sides to it.  Id guess theres a side with really nice rooms. And the bad side was actrually abandoned and Theyr bringing it back to life.

Wait, how did you did that? I did not say Ryan do that.😢
ERT wrote a whole dang essay 😭

“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011” is probably one of the most haunted things to be said at that hotel
Leuk

“It sure issss :D” HER NAME IS VANITY HELPPPP (I didn’t realise I Alr commented lol mb)
“Im out of sour stripes” 😂😂
You should try some Canadian hotels, specifically in Winnipeg, we have a lot of terrible ones! Just be wary of the ones known for human trafficking, but as a man it's not much of a danger
Ert chill bro
Medium rare
If you think hotel Phillips is haunted then go to the Cecil hotel
Once I stayed in a hotel in England there where multiple mouses under the bed!
You didn't notice 511 room door open by itself
the plump can be fixed so its not that busted
I'm at a log cabin right now so yeah
Tri county in Cincinnati ohio or Hamilton in hamilton Ohio
In the last hotel the review got in a contest
I REALY THOUGHT THE MOTEL N2 WAS LIKE U KNOW THE PARANORMAL FUN ROOMS THAT ARE SOOOOO COLERFUL LIKE THAT EXACTLY
Is it haunted her: IT SURE ISSSS
i've seen your drive thru videos, and you travelled some crazy distances..... How about you try the drive thru's in india?
That person in the thumbnail is definitely superstitious
how is Ryan so calm though if it was me i will literally fight with the air🐷
Don’t you think that Ryan looks like Gordam Ramsey?
2 of the hotels were rated 3 stars 😂 the title says 1 star hotels 😅 what a clown
Guys I think we can all confirm that E.R.T did not like that place.
He definitely asked for 511
The first one was literally on a true crime show.that I watch every night. Take that as you will...
I feel bad for vanity
You should have came and got me im not far from Detroit

❤Who’s  Watching this in 2023?❤😊 8:10
I'm from ABQ and I can say that motel six has burnt
My summary of what people might mean about haunted: malfunction. If your systems don't work well, or are poorly designed, it will lead to this like things turning in and off.
Omg 😮
“oh this is a stutfinder” my dude is clueless (just kidding love you Ryan)
Ryan u are by far the best ytber
I would bet that the elevator went down there because someone on the way down pressed that floor so it went down there, that seems quite obvious I don’t know why that would make it haunted
10:07
😋
Cool
U ARE NO TRANSFORMER
“ i have bought sone bitcoin in 2011”😂
2:00 thats double clogged
I liked my comment because no one did.
If you didnt come from Tik tok, you are allowed to like this comment.
Make a Joyride commercial
POV the hotel staff FBI OPEN UP!
can you make joyride come to Canada
This is nothing compared to the hotels I’ve stayed in. You want some suggestions? Come stay at the budget Inn in Appleton, Wisconsin. Or the Howard Johnson in Wisconsin in Appleton.
Ryan man I love your candy I got my hands on some sweet succulent joyride on my vacation (sour blue raspberry🔥)
Is joyride in Toronto???

Room 511 was hunted,Ryan talked to the lady about those hunted rooms, Ryan got room 511,a ghost said they dont have sour strips😂
"I'm out of sour strip" that ghost is sigma
Can you go to norway and check the hotels there 😃
The thumbnail makes no sense

As someone who lives in NM I would say that if you want to find sketchy hotels or motels come to NM.
You sould test 1 star reviews on resorts

“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011” 💀
I’m 90% sure I saw Kung Fu Panda 4 at that same Theater.
I stayed at the Magnolia in 2018 and it was pretty decent.  I’d give it a 3.5.  I definitely did not have a room anything like that though.
I live in Albuquerque, NM actually. I am a student at the University of New Mexico. I have seen this hotel before and it is terrifying, but in my opinion of love this City. Love your videos.
2:43 my dumb little brother thought he was sonic☠️
Can you react to some in India?
14:48  did a guost wipe ur butt😊
Go to the tigers game now or else die do you have one choice to go to the Tigers game

And the 3rd oneT-T
Um I kinda felt really scared when in the 2nd hotel the light was turning off and on so I felt like there’s a ghost in the hotel or motel
1 up or joyride
I LIVE IN STAPLIEHURST NEBRASKA LETS GOOOO 21:48 NEBRASKA IS GREAT!
Store near me   I'm in england💀

Is it just me or on the side did anyone see the roof tiles like flying up or is it just me
2:09

15:43 ryan trying to act like a person who just saw a ghost
Amazing video! Your effort really shows. Keep up the great work!
✝️
Is the joyride halal?
“511”? Nah more like 911💀
Pigeons gonna be famous
I had a 4 Starr hotel room in Thailand for only 33 euro’s 🤩
Ryan i literary have 1,9 mbps wifi
The front desk lady 100% put you in room 511 since you told her you only came since it was haunted
RYAN ROOM 511 HAD A MOVIE MADE FROM IT THAT IS CRAZY
Wait, joyride is made by a YouTuber??! I just found you on tiktok, but I've been eating joyride gummies for half a year ever since I saw em in my Walmart xD
Ryan my boy, can you please lower the prices on your candy because I’m trying to buy it and it’s very expensive so I want to see your website and they’re $30 per pack or I’m wrong so could you please like lower your prices?😂😂😂

Hi
anyone in 2024?
I love your little side quests in every video so much😂 like, kong fu panda has nothing to do with 1 star hotels and yet it's still a part of the journey. Love it.
Why is Ryan Trahan so goated?
How much money did this cost? Respects man
As someone who lives in Omaha Nebraska, that is one of our worse hotel rooms
W GREG W DIEGO
Something’s wrong with the chair in the first hotel
note to self:never leave romania or us
is that the 1st motel from breaking bad?
Did the ghost wipe your butts ended me🤣
I honestly can’t believe that they gave you that room at the end of the video🎉😂😂😂😂😂
This room really needs a blue chair Ryan: moves camera can still see blue chair
Mind
There is no video👎🇮🇪
U/Ryan:Hotel Phillips is haun- *cutely somehow gets to the hotel* WHERE R GHOSTS?!

Do the hotels have smoke alarms
The stub finder bit was funny another reason why Ryan trahan is a great YouTuber
18:00 woah 😳
9:06
Why was he smiling while watching kungfu panda three
That camera you left better have been broken
Kung Fu Panda was peak bro
Detroit Michigan the hotel is actually fire
Is part of the shtick putting the mic as close to the mouth as possible? I don’t get it
S
why at the beginning of when someone said “toilet was haunted” they rated it 5…
a stud fined does not find paranormal things it finds the studs in walls so you know where not to put stuff in your walls
Try Cecil hotel
Sigmas who acctually read E.R.T.’s review 👇22:43
I like how Ryan's voice for people making one star reviews are southern people even though those people are the most likely to think that this is normal
0:19 I thought he would go up

i love it when ryan reads the  Reviews on the motels he reads it in character acting like a whole different person that's another reason why Ryan is so wholesome
If I ever visit America and I need a 1-Star Hotel Ill just play this series in the plane
Ryan didn't realize that in kung fu panda 4  the pig who said skadoosh in the the dragon warrior audition was Mrbeast 🤣
Jammy time🎉
OK, basically, hotel people don't want one star so they do their job correctly.
Ryan has to go to Cecil hotel next 🔥🏨🛎
One star hotel like gta5 place
Motel 6 kind of reminds me of the trip I went on fishing
The ghost was eating your sour strips
The fact that the first hotel you went to is shaped like an F

"Back in the day" ghost hunter youtubers made their videos at 3 AM. Meanwhile Sam and Colby still kickin with their witching hour investigations 😂

That wierd thug that spans across a wall is called a stud
Those who thought this videos was a joke👇
How do you always get the Window Seat?! 🪟💺
Dangerous
Ryan should do the opposite and go to five star hotels and have to leave a 1 Star review but he can’t lie
You need to stay at the former Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles.
jammy time
imangine if joyride is getting avaible in mongolia💀
I’ve actually been in the Kansas City one and it was really nice
Cody ko😭🤦🏼‍♂️
15:00 made me giggle
Right when you started investigating the place for ghosts my friends evil cat that im watching knocked something off the desk and scared the absolute shit out of me 😂😂
When he read the review left my Cacey, he sounded like your average redneck.
When he reads Scott's review about the Motel 6 in New Mexico, he literally sounds like Jack Doherty if he had less testosterone than Vatican city is in light years.
👾 Test a 1 star app 👾
Hey ryan i went to that toy store on a trip to omaha and found some rare gaming stuff thanks for showing the store

17:59 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I liked Jamey time
There is a difference between motels and hotels. Motels have doors on the outside.  ALL motels are dumps and you should only stay at one if you have no choice.  Also,  Kung Fu Panda is s*cks.
My son and I watch you all the time. Much love.
HOTEL 2 IS BACKROOMS TF
Ryan if you want to be on Shark Tank 🦈🔥 the follow your dream
time to play with my toys now🤣

Ive went to a Motel 6 once, had bed bugs, and moldy walls. Idk how it was still in business.      It was florida lmao

Check hotel room for hidden cameras, they look like a normal object:  clock, 3 M coat hanger, wall socket, etc.
"The Sun Has Been Spotted!"

Try Indian 1 star hotels.....ur hotels are 3 star comparitively
2nd Hotel: view: nice,  bed looks comfy, walls/floor: pretty unfinished HALLWAY/ELEVATOR= terrifying :(
I went to a hotel and my room had a weird toilet it flushes at random times so 3 stars.
blue raspberry doesn't exsist
Bed bugs? Busted
Motel 6? Fire? Bullet holes on the bedFrame?
The pigeon behind him at the motel 6

Sorry I broke the fence
Ryan can I pls have joyride because i am broke and could never be able to buy your pls @ryan Trahan
27:18 „I asked for medium rare, i got medium rare” also ryan asking for medium
I'm not sure how many Kung Fu Panda movies I've seen. Could start at #3 but then I would risk having to watch #2 in the wrong order, or not knowing I never watched it. And starting at #2 means I might have to watch the same movie again, while also strangely regretting I didn't refresh my memory on the original plot of #1. Might as well binge all 3 or even 4 if it's not too early. But then again it's statistically unlikely they are all available on my subscribed streaming services in my region. I don't like this world. Keep up the good work Ryan!
loved the video  try canada 1 star reviews
Ryan should bring Joyride to Shark Tank
I think that’s a lie💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩👻👻

Of course, we start with a Motel 6 😂😂
It’s Michigan deal with it
The final one was probably the best one, while other people like ERT got a worse room. So, the complaints were probably right.
Is it just me or does 4:00  remind me of the insane asylum from outlast 1??
ryan:is this place haunted vanity aka desk lady:YES OFC

Ryan is a good tourist
5:40 why he filming naked ???
Your lie was that you have to change your pants after the elevator oh, none of them all a lie
He got room 511 because he was talking about the fact the hotel is haunted
I need more paranormal hotel videos👏
My last name is albuquerque
Wasted your time of watching Kung fu panda the movie series suck in fact that made the whole episode of hotel reviews suck.

:)
l hate your videos 😭 you are weird 😠 but you can do that when I know you have a great day ❤️ I hate you now ok
The video on my screen that popped up at the end was an offbrand Sharman video of spoiled kids think they own the world 💀
Hello Ryan so I was in a haunted hotel because I was sleeping and the toilet just kept flushing I was like 5 so I was hella scared
I got your watermelon wedges😊😊😊
Ryan the high tech device you had was a stud finder
In hotel phillips, he probaly didnt get "attacked" because he was filming. I also read E.R.T.'s review when this video was uploaded.
I love the “oof” that plays when the rating is revealed
17:04 the fact it says stud finder is hilarious😂😂
<:
ryan
i was born on the same day as Ryan!!
Poopy
Bed bugs are nocturnal
The last hotel doesn't deserve to get 1 star
0:06 there was a 5 star review on the toilet was haunted
11:04 Aint no way little bro said that...
20:52 I literally thought this was from anyone BUT Ryan.
bro i live right next to omaha
Why am I so happy you got one of the haunted. I was literally like wishing in my head you 😅😂
The fact that you’ve been lying about watching kung fu panda for so long 😂
I went to st Regis in Malaysia and it sucked! We did an 8 people cooking class and only 4 of us moved and touched anything! They were treating different people how they wanted by allowing acceptions for some and not all! They also opened our hotel door to some random guy because they claimed it was their room! All these are the staffs problem and i dont recommend going there
Wait I live OMAHA
Ryan:did the ghost wipe your butt!?!?!*  Me: excuse me WHAT THE FU-
Bros bout to turn into one punch man if he does one hundred of those a DAY XD
He did such a awesome job at doing his job!

As someone who lives in Omaha I’m always surprised when Omaha or Nebraska is mentioned
I passed by a motel six once it was in the middle of nowhere and in Canada(where I live)
And the toilet's haunted...5 stars! 🎉
Why do you go to sleep with your pajamas on then wake up with your shirt off did the ghost take it
Why do you go to sleep whit your pajamas on then wake up with your shirt off did the ghost take it
Id take him. He would  love the farm and he'd have a female sister!!
This makes me wanna cry!!!  💔 😥
Ryan this is a great video. But I have an idea another penny series but cross vertically not horizontally
I live in Omaha so it’s really weird seeing stuff I know. I have been to that hotel I walk past that triangle shaped building during the transition. I have walked that exact street and been in the phone booth. It’s on the porch of the spaghetti works. I also have been in that toy store several times. And it’s not exactly a toy store because you can buy a copious amount of knives. I recommend going to the Grapefruit record store or Hollywood candy.
Don't know what to expect
12:48 Odd 🇧🇲Has the Same Name
0:23 What is this music called? I think it's really cool music!
backhotels* you went in the hotel called backhotels
Bro  When Ryan asked where is the vending machine is and the man was breathing like why are u here

Nice reviews. But what kind of idiot intentionally leaves their camera outside their hotel room door?
Howdy
Vanity sounded super nice lol
Maybe the ghost recording is just Ryan sleeptalking
It went like and sub
E.R.T:TLDR
16:10 Vanity was enjoying the story telling
U we’re soooooooooooooooo close to getting that free throw
Ghost hunting Ryan is good
Fun fact people rate many hotels or restaurants 1 star to just lie to the people and fail their businesses there is a lesson to this  Honesty is the best policy

Yes you should Ryan move to Omaha Nebraska some of the places you went there I've been in like that toy store it's called The imaginarium

I happy to see Ryan Christian.  God bless you Ryan.😊
I WANT  PIZZA NOW PLSSSSS  wait why did he want to see breast milk 😂😂😂
Bro who follows sour patch kids
19:40 when ryan said beep beep something in my house beeped 😅
I really thought that you were going to roll with the fact the stud finder was anything but...I feel that anyone that didn't know that, has to be pretty stupid. Even if you've never used a stud finder, to not know what one is and to recognize what COULD be one...ya, that's a level of stupid I'd never want to be close to. So anyone stupid enough to not realize that was a stud finder, please never ever be within 10 miles of me.
Literally no one came from tiktok
Anyone else see Sam from Sam and Colby in the thumbnail bro 😭
Seriously, the first challenge
It new Mexico   Of course  they got to be some skin walkers
I like the concept of this video, however I don't understand the forced 5 star review. I've only watched the first room thus far, but it leaves me wondering... what is his final genuine census of the motel rather than a potentially disingenuous 5 star review, which isn't funny or anything since we know he's going to leave a 5 star review and find things such as they had a show on that I liked, therefore 5 stars... so what's the point?
Lol 😂
Your candy is amazing!
Did he just say Something about breast milk?
didn't tophia stay In the first hotel for people that know her

Ryan. The light of me please i beg of you to heart my commet love - a drippy dog

Maybe a strip club would be useful for a Stud Finder. 😅
Would a motion sensor be useful on a cruise ship?😅
Maybe Shining II could be filmed at that KC hotel. 😅
Say hello to the Chiefs in KC. Please listen to KCKN for country music on FM 😅

You could use a wire grate to cover the outflow pipe so you don’t lose any fish

I live in Detroit so sorry your hotel experience was crappy and scary. I recommend the red roof inn in Warren, Mi for another review with honesty. 😊😂❤
Let’s have a min of silent of people who read that last review of the video 😊
Joyride da best chain    👇

Hey, I live in Michigan! I'm a big fan too!

that yellow thing he had was just a tool to find the studs in a wall (solid parts) for if you want to put something like a nail in the wall
He said at 15:16 he said 3 there’s 4! It’s alright ignore me I like to correct people 😅😅😊😊😊😅

Who want nothing
The first hotel did a partnership with the Garfield movie somehow.
You mean 3 truths and 1 lie 10:05

Hey Ryan I am a small YouTuber and love your videos so I was wondering if you could give me a shout out thank you ❤
No I still get jammy time 28:06
22:44 I read the whole thing
Someone said like and subscribe
Hi Ryan, you are on a billboard in Times Square in New York City
My daughter watches your show so I thought I would share if you ever wanted to check it out. Super 8 by Wyndham near the Grand Canyon was as gross as it gets. The bad wifi and no breakfast were the least of what the issues were. Blood on sheets and wall, bugs on the floor, coke smashed into the counter top between the beds. Took my daughter here. We left with no refund. Just a gross scam in Williams, AZ. I have pics but don’t know how to post them on here. So gross.
19:04 if only we could use shift lock
9:43 tho
The way the guard inhaled and exhaled 😂😂
It’s shelf fun to watch you might
Bro it looks like a fallout game with the first motel

Show me a video was really great but you should make a submarine song video and it’s all about the saweet sake made
When you showed the picture of like the dark hallway and the second Hotel I went to a hotel that had the Hall of Doom it was like so dark the lights were barely bright
Bro sid a whole story 💀 22:30
I bet you couldn't eat only joyride for 24 hour (it's a challenge)
22:43 I actually read all of that. Technically he just said he doesn’t want to stay at this hotel.😅
Ryan once said:  „I am being blinded by a military weapon” 😂😂😂😂😂
I live in michigan
My name is diago and my life so sick song name diego
I love Diego Ryan and chicken strips
E.R.T Was SO angry
the detroit one kinda reminds me of a hotel in Vancouver I stayed in, the lobby was super nice, renovated, had a very welcoming aesthetic and then as soon as you took the elevator to the room and go into the hall you're like "hold on, it just aged back many decades." and going into the room it was just very 80s. Just wow. The transition...
Go too my place hotel my mom works there my mom said it was really nice so if you see a girl with Black looking hair and Glasses and Boy/Karen hair and Blue eyes and has Sparks as her last name and read her name I can't spell it Don't ask if she is 49 she is It is in marcet Mishagan she is nice and has 7 or 6 or 8 Bosses

You get : jammy time I get : to subscribe
I live in Missouri
You should go to the clown motel
Repent and trust in Jesus. He's the only way to Heaven. We've all sinned and deserve Hell. Sins like lying, lusting, etc. Repent and trust only in Jesus, and you will be saved! You can be saved because he took the punishment for our sins on himself when he died on the cross, just like someone can pay your speeding fine in court, and you get off free. Romans 3:23 John 3:16❤😊❤
Why does a haunted hotel remind of that one episode from the suite life

1:18 it’s hulk!
Make a video like I tested 5 star video games
The start was amazing Pls make more Vids like this
Bro I live in Cape Town and I’m wondering if your joyride candy is coming to South Africa? Because I’d REALLY like to eat your candy.
I don’t understand why that would be ants in the TV
Ryan, i absolutely would love to test hotels I love staying in hotels, and I actually live in Omaha Nebraska 😁
10:32 was so funny lol
Bro hotel Phillips is in Kansas and haunted, have Sam& Colby checked it out??

ryan trahan is my fav youtube
Why dos he do this to his self
My name is Phillip
vanity is the loml
13:18 bro actually shit his pants
I read ERTs ling review. 1. Same as the hotel gave him a headache, his review did same to me.  2. $200 put an overdraft on your business account?!!? Seems this hotel isnt the only one who doesnt know how to run a business. 😂
Ryan you suck you take so long to post bye you suck
I don’t think a stud finder will help with ghosts.  However, if you need to hang a picture of Haley… there ya go! ❤ Love your videos.
Really specific reviews but bizarrely opposite issues.  Love Jammy Time! “ A huge win when the phone doesn’t have blood on it!…” WTF 😂
I stayed in Omaha Nebraska at that same hotle
not the meth pipe burns on the desk
12:13 HAHSAHHQJWJAJAJAJAJAJAJJAJA
Cansomeonereplytothiscomment
Bro i think the device is a stud finder
I want joyrides😥😢
I miss you everytime😩😩😩
😮😅 you are obviously very brave because I am so OCD, that I cannot stay in a motel at all!! If I travel I have to have a high maintenance hotel!! And I still bring my own blankets pillows and plastics on the bed I will not sleep on anybody else's she's rather they've been washed or not!!!!
I live in Michigan and I am 1 hour from Detroit so i might go there or I just got insulted ( don't ask why)
These videos are amazing and in the quality is amazing
10:33 its doing that cuz its a bomb.
Go to 5 star something but you have to leave a 1 star review
ZzzzsZxqqww
I’m actually scared of that hallway in the second hotel that light was flickering 😮
Come on man. You can't compare a 1 star basic room review to a penthouse suite (which is what you got in the last clip). You have to have the same experience as the reviewer.  As an experienced and frequent traveler, every room is different, especially if you get an upgrade which is what you get when you travel a lot.
I got your candy and I got the last one
Hi
Ryan as someone who lives here in abq I can easily say that motel 6 is very dangerous  lots of killings and shootings happen there regularly
joy ride joy ride
Really said I made a mistake by coming here alone. What’s the cameraman or roach?
Jammy time😂😂😂
any joyrides in ireland???
trade offer accepted
I love your videos 😊😊😊😊😊😊  I have subscribed
As someone who lived in New Mexico I can say you should NEVER stay at a motel 6… it’s like where some of the most ghetto and dangerous stuff happens in Albuquerque. Albuquerque is a one of the most dangerous city in NM and is one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.
I was really freaked out by the ghosts talking😅
where was there breast milk in the fridge? a flashlight an audio recorder and a stud finder omg
howdy
Well thats a nightmare
There are a set of elevators at the hospital I work at that, mind you I’m just going up one floor, feel like you’re going into ludicrous speed. When the elevator begins to ascend you feel the gravity pulling you to the floor and when it stops on your floor it lifts your stomach into your throat. Odder part is that the elevator hasn’t even fully ascended. After the doors begin to open you can see the elevator still has a few inches before its flesh with the second floor. I hate riding in them.

The Rules Are 1. I Have To Rate Each Hotel 5 Stars 2. I Can't Lie 3. But I Can Over Exaggerate
What that’s crazy that it’s the F Word Motel six✌🏼
Detroit had a 2 stars not 1 😢
Im on my dads account and my name is Rebecca 🫥😐 I’m not rude guys 😅
Please visit the Quaint Inn, mchenry md! the worst a hotel can ever get! any other youtubers i suggest ya try to go there for a video
Ert wrote a 3000 page essay due about a hotel
14:58 it was probably a ryan trahan fan
Am i the only one but his voice sounds a lot like pewdiepie
Bro was rly using a stud finder on ghosts
0:24 “this place feels like a gta v mission” caught me off guard 😂
10:20 Ryan there already is a blue chair😅
Can u do a night in the Cecil hotel
If your from TikTok your not loved
Okay, the elevator thing... someone called the car, reached in and pushed a button, let it go to that floor, then called it again, so it would go to the floor, open and close with no one in it, then go back up.  Not a ghost.
#10:15
The ooh sound is BeAuTiFuL
I read that review and it is loooooooonnnnng! Like oh my gosh I know some hotels are better than others but sheesh
Why not 28:02

Joyride is so good

I live in NM, no YouTubers do anything with ABQ (I LIVE THEREEEEEE) I saw ABQ NM and screamed with joy
As someone from ABQ, god bless you for being willing to stay there and I'm so glad you lived to tell the tale 😂 ABQ is not for the faint of heart
Or the Cecil hotel in Los Angeles!
Try Las Vegas Luxor
I really love the enthusiasm that vanity brought to the hotel, you can really tell they like working there
Man was using a stud finder “19.05 in the video”

Wtf 😂 18:00
Is that a stud finder? 😂😂
My school logo is the shark😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊😂😂😂
Hi! I’m RyanTrahans biggest fan, and I looked at this thumbnail again and the person that has the review on the thumbnail is you look closely it’s Sam golbach (take a screenshot then zoom in) try it out!
I lived in NM and moved because there was a shooting in my neighborhood…so it’s not safe
Aw I love detroit. You went to Ima!! They're my fav Ramen spot in Detroit. Visit the DIA next time you're here!  Also the front desk lady is SO me.
Ryan's humor is top tier!
How about you go to the hotel where Selena died
18:45 that's a stud finder that's how you find studs in the wall
22:43  This is NOT a "Premier Boutique Hotel". I DONT CARE IF LADY GAGA OR SNOOP DOGG stayed here, all of these negative reviews for the Magnolia Hotel were right!!  After reading so many negative reviews on several diffirent sites, we called the Durham Museum which booked us to do 10 shows for local elementary schools here.  We called our contact Abby, who booked us here instead of Embassy Suites she booked us last year when we preformed in Omaha. We were very happy with  The Embassy Suites, as they have a pool, jacuzzi, free made to order breakfast. Another edit later
I dare every single one of you to watch it in 0.25x
22:43 HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR THEM TO TYPE THIS?!-
I’m literally in the hotel now that is haunted
Emotional damage
R d,  d kick re dg=. Credvy 😢v 😢move rk vdedYjgfv

When he opened the door to the 2nd room idk why I thought there were going to be people in the room
lol
Took me time to understand that you’re not jack doherty 😂😂😂 you look and sound like him
The 1 star is only the first hotel. 1 star for the video!   (I LIKED AND COMMENT, RYAN.)
At this point you should call this series “5 can’t lie” it sounds good😂
Is you double click on this comment it likes it try it out :)
We all love greg.
I’ve been to that toy store 26:11
I LOFE PANDA EXPRESS
Just got my joyride
"I'm gonna play with my toys now." WOW THERE RYAN THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE WEIRD
I work at hotel Phillips, haunted vibes 1000% and I don’t normally believe in that stuff. Elevators opening or stopping randomly, lights flicker in the restaurant really late and so on. You can leave your stuff out and it wouldn’t get stolen, if anything it’s take to the front.
8
I like how every once in a while he’ll do a southern accent for one of the reviews
I went to Kansas city MO and it is really nice there but I didn't go to that hotel I actually rented a house, but I did pass that hotel and it actually gave me the goosebumps. Good Luck
Ryan I’m gonna be honest right now how is a place being strange and losing your money to a VENDING MACHINE good enough to get you 5 star and yet you question 15:00 why she gave 5 star
It wasn’t a flying kind of cockroaches😅
kug panda is so good
12:04 I’m eating ramen right now😂😅 20:04 THE NOISES💀
Who else read the while thing at 22:43. My voice is tired at this point from how long it is.
My name is diego
My cousin is called Diego
4:05 thats lterally a barking dog
The people who work at the hotels see this: 👁️👄👁️
If i hear one more “bro fell off” comment,i will evade my taxes and bills.
9:55 bro went into the backrooms horizontally
What did Ryan see in the other 2004 room😮
I live like 3 hours away from Kansas city
Five star shit
Does he give anyone else PJ Duncan vibes??
Ryan im subscribing
I’m not trying to freak you out but you do realize that you can get bed bugs and even scabies from unsanitary places. 😮
"Like and subscribe..." had me dying.
Cool😎
@TZM
Did bulletin shot 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Well I’m subscribed lmao this video was lit
👻:Spock got into the trash again
Hey Ryan! please please please start selling Joyride in the Philippines 🤧

Roses are red violets are blue I liked my own comment cause nobody would like to 😢😔
The cockroaches in that first woman's review were female.. only males can fly..
How did you manage to get such clear audio in this video?
woah! cool!
I love watching your videos with my daughter.  Monday we went to target for your new candy, but they were completely sold out! We went back today and scored 4 bags strawberry twists. We bought some for friends to try. It was good to see your candy selling out,  means you're having success and we love that for you!
11:54 bro is in the backrooms 💀
The same time I was in Detroit
UPS truck 😎
Breast milk in the fridge should be the new standard if you ask me 😁Bonus points for that.

The fact that he falls asleep on his pajamas on right right and then he wakes up shirtless
Ryan is a great youtuber love the editing keep up the hard work love the vids! 😁👍❤
😲
it's a lot of history in Detroit, Michigan!  in fact I'm from there, and am always learning more history from there!
Alright looking forward to your review in Detroit, my home town???
ryan is tbh like, the funniest youtuber ive ever seen
OK that toilet is sick in itself!
2Mbps is not two megabytes but megabits. It’s a big difference (a megabyte is 8x a megabit)
I live by Detroit. It is probably one of the most unsafe places in the world.
Lie the room need's a blue chair
what review site do you use?
he dose all this for us we love u ❤❤
I did read the reviwe it took 10 minutes of my life
0:38 because there is a lot Of crime in Albuquerque
Ryan as someone who go to plases wow he he
can u collab w ben of the week PLEASE
I love shark tank.
Idk how tf there wasn't a breaking bad reference on the Albuquerque hotel
People who thought Diego was a woman at first 👇
if you didn’t come watching this, you are allowed to like this comment
I can’t believe Ryan honored liminal spaces. Great job Ryan.
commenting this on every on of your videos because i just thought of it : call your fan base THE TRAHAN TROUP and it could also be the triple t(ttt the, trahan troop)
based on the full creases on the jammys on night 3 I'm assuming you actually just pose with them and then sleep in the nude
Is the candys halal
fully expected the voice recorder to pick up several sleep farts hahahha
Can u make a store for ur candy in Baghdad
JAMMY TIME.  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME  JAMMY TIME

Diego the GOAT
Yes

The second hotel is actually unsettling
W diego
I think Ryan must comb his hair with an eggbeater.
Why did he rate the hotels 5 even though some of the reviews were actually facts
12:06 🙏🙏
Why is the exit sign red? 16:50
Are you superstitious ? 14:51
hahaha
Love the video always make me smile:) ❤
Ummmm
DONT SLEEP IN ROOM 13 LIVE REACTION
I didn't like how the staff in Kansas answered Ryan's question "Is this place haunted?" so happily, shes like "It sure is!!"
The question is when he’s about to sleep he has a shirt one and the next day ✨IT GONE✨
Good video
Ryan your not going to believe this I found joyride in AMC theaters you know I had to cop
16:50
18:55 minutes he uses a device for finding the wood in the wall.
What does Ryan always order when he goes to Panda Express it looks so good😊
umm thats not 2 mb/s thats 2 mega BITS which is equal to 0.25 mb/s
am i seeing that wrong here or am i seeing something
WhY iS uR cAnDY sO exPEnSiVe>:(
Good choice always Good choice I always get medium rare steaks too
I watched all 4 movies
Shark tank is fire

Ghost wipes your but is personal 😂😂
Oh, my goodness, he just went to my state that I used to live in. I used to live in new Mexico
honestly some of the reviews are more funny than some youtubers (not u tho, ur funny :D)
Ryan can casually create the most epic picture of a toilet but the most goofy picture of him sitting by a desk right after
The accentsss😭😭😭

I think ryan should test 5 star hotels/motels and give it 1 star but it also has to be true. The last hotel AMAZING i rlly wanna go there
I love how Detroit is in all of these bad rated videos!! I’ve been going to Detroit my whole life it’s not as bad as ppl think!! if u ever go again try the river walk or the eastern market early Sunday morning
E.R.T a D1 crashout fr fr😂
I love the airbnb I'm in cause it's AMAZING. No bugs just so amazing. It comes with a boat. It was in gold Rush place around canyon Lake somewhere? But it's amazing. 5 stars
I live in a small town right next to Omaha
Let’s see if there’s breast milk in the fridge
Howdy 🤠

You feel cold suddenly it’s a ghost or spirits that do paranormal activity.
Imscerd

The reason why you did not get any paranormal activity in the hotel is because you were wearing the color blue and your pajamas which actually goes away the ghosts so yeah
Not even going to lie, the poeple reading Ryan's reviews probably think his crazy (includeing the motel/hotel owners/staff)   ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
0:52 Jason thought we were on a 5 star budget, little does he know does he know we are on a 1 star budget   its great👍
It’s like I’m always in the city that he goes to in one of his kind of videos put on the completely wrong side of the
It said like to subscribe, and then it said like ooh

Before going to bed in Michigan, you should set the clock radio dude. It’s less creepy if you fix it - don’t ask the security guy for assistance tho!

When he opened the hallway to his 2nd hotel room i legitimately thought the footage was edited. Looks like we found the inspiration for the backrooms guys 😬
Bro was using a stud finder
Ryannnn
I think Vanity gave you one of the haunted rooms on purpose lol 😂
Im just chillin in the 1- star hotels🐁🐁
I’m the bogeyman
I already watch all of them and kun fu panda 1, 2, 3, and 4 also the dragon knight
Movie was indeed not fire
Ħávê æņ ąŵşœmě ðæÿ
People who seen the people in the back on the first one
I would never go to a one star hotel in my life I only go to ones with the restaurants in the pools
I think 1 and 2 were truths and..3 was lie
That Lady DEFINITELY GAVE HIM Room 511 On Purpose! 😅
I think the reason the hotel in detroit felt creepy was that it was meant to be opulent as detroit was once a major economic power house. After the car companies left detroit became somewhat of a "ghost city". The layout of the hotel represents a time long gone and "feels" like there should be more people there but aren't. Its almost as if the hotel is filled with ghosts
I saw something it was glowing red 17:59 remember it's really hard to see cuz it's really small n appears for lik a split second
Hi
Mr ryan pls dont make a 4 hr vid
😂 you are just so cute!

the security guard was done 😭
I have a message for you from my family   My family: Ryan is stupid.
I am in love with your pajamas😂❤ .

I live in Albuquerque thanks so much🎉
The third hotel, Rebecca, once I was there like Rebecca had a knife when I was sleeping, she was looking at me at my sleep when I saw her I kicked her right in the stomach. I took his knife. I hit it with the back of the knife. Another time I came through. There was vanity like the same person you were talking he said, do you want a spooky room he said, the most spooky his room is 511 I said no please she said all right she said my manager is going to give you a card I don’t know which floor it is. I hope it’s not like the haunted one. I want you to stay comfy and I saw it was 511 I was shaking when I got in the room first I open the door when I went inside, and instantly closed, no one was there please no matter what you do. If you get 511 leave like say I’m sorry I don’t need this room anymore. Bye-bye this room stocked me shower keeps turning on and off please stay safe.
W Jack!
Why do you have to use a five star when it’s obviously that you don’t
Hey hey there's one in Indiana can you please test it out?
Imagine if on the first night of that first hotel the only thing Ryan hears is just the cod zombies round 1 starting music

Hey Ryan ! Im a big fan of yours , but there is something that I’m disappointed in . Your candy , look I’m from Saudi Arabia . Your candy : Joyride is frickin 93$ in Saudi Arabia . I’m super dissapointed.
Btw kungfu panda 4 is the best….
When you did this video it was my birthday
Hi
I got a little bit overwhelmed... Seriously
2:11 the accent 😂
Please more penny series
Well warfare isn't good
Can you make a video about going to Las Vegas and going to the tallest skyscraper
😂😂😂WOW, I sure bet this was a great video to film. Well done Ryan well ✔️ 👍 done
29:48
This is bad
Not the flashlight 😂
I’m so glad I was eating coco pebbles when you showed John M’s toliet!
I love your videos soon much your the best 👌 ❤😊
Is it just me, but I can’t help but feel disinterested by Ryan’s videos lately - he makes good stuff don’t get me wrong, but I feel like I want something more original. I know what I’m getting with Ryan’s videos and maybe I want to see him in different ways instead of this usual shtick
Ryan can you please stay at Malvern Manor it’s a haunted place that my dad works at in Malvern Iowa please
The last hotel had me day dreaming
Oh man this hotel looks like ghost house XD
Who thinks that Ryan is the one star king 🤴  👇
16:55 the dorm room sounds like haunted
His friends watching this video be like:😢😠😡😢
I wonder how much money he spends in one day😂
If we see Ryan Trahan on a review, then we know it's good.
dued i read the magnolia review and it was crazyy
no the fact that he woke up got out of bed placed the camera down and then got back into bed
i had no idea that there were stairs in a hotel room
don go to the  red haunted school it is so crazy it wall say die in chinese 28:50
7:13 But I could have met him   I'm from detroit
I'm happy Ryan came to KC
Last one not hotel room that’s a house
He acted normal with the bullet holes
HOL UPP I SAW IT IN CAPPANTS 9th BOOK "The Poop That Ate Detroit" Is it right guys??? Lmk in the comments

I live in new Mexico😂❤
I’m from MO and I have been around this place and I used to go around that area a lot 😅
Ryan 2024 quote "I'm out of sour strips"😂😂😂😂 21:09
3:43 someone was just eating vanilla ice cream👍
All of them hotels are terrifying
who names their daughter Vanity.. lol
I feel like I have seen this hotel but I never been to that place
Everybody’s kung fu fighting kung fu fighting
i'm glad i subscribed to you !
Ryan: hopefully I don't get one of these 4 rooms... also him gets the first haunted room he talked about
E. R. T.  why did you write so much???  22:43
AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN DETROIT WE WELCOME YOU TO MICHIGAN
I DID READ IT ON MY OWN TIME! My eyes hurt :/ also that was somebody stating the same 6 things 3 times over lol
I never like videos so your lucky I really liked this vido
Everybody in America has wierd names like Nima and vanity like what’s next BARTHOLEMEW OR SMTH (I’m not trying to be rude I just think it’s odd)
More I need moreeeeeeee
Good luck doing 4,400
Doood he would be such a good dad😂
all these comments abt motel 6 making me glad Ryan was safe. I hate that it's probably clear why Frans had that problem.
The device: Ahdhfhd like and subscribe fjjfjdksksocov  Ryan: I didn’t hear anything what about you guys?
😂😅
Try indian hotels next time dude🤣💀
You do any thing to make us laugh
Ryan is the best youtuber ever
JAMMYTIME
4:37 "Panda express, why you ask? I cant see"
I'd stay the re
26:10 why is agumon hanging with a bunch of pokemon?
Did anyone see sam from sam an coby in the thumbnail?
make more scary videos please
If you want to get rid of a ghost pray to jesus
7:54 ik that the reviewer's name is Adam but without reading that at first, him saying "I'm gonna do it Adam" when MY name is Adam kinda threw me for a loop lmao
these hotels are normal in there own way
Average school band tour hotel where there is more kids to a room than bed space.
I'd go there before in 2021 in new Mexico , its was not like that it was good 6:23
YOU ARE CRAZY but cool😵‍💫
28:02
17:35 faulty wiring and plumbing 💀
The lie is three

Wow
I ❤ your vids
E.R.T I SWEAR HE HAD HIS WHOLE DAY JUST TO WRITE DAMN 2 WHOOE PARGARAGHS IN TOTAL
Missouri don’t let me down, please XD
I can’t believe that ghost got him
Stay safe brotha
When Ryan pulled up to the hotel in Detroit I thought for a good sec that it was the hotel Cecil then I remembered that the Cecil is in California 🤣
The Omaha Hotel 100% thought you were a YouTube hotel reviewer or something and upgraded the room to make the hotel look good. It's amazing what a camera will do.
Damn Ryan was lucky on hotel four when he gets food shawty was kinda thick
Vanity for the W
I could binge a whole ass season of this
What a D@mn minute I live in Michigan
Monkey like vid
W diego.
Ryan I wanna be on shark tank one day. Me well why not now you own joyride.
he needs to make an "I Tested 1-star Coffee Shops" video!!!
IT SURE ISSSSSSSS!
Errrrmmm What The SIGMA DIGMA LIGMA
I've been to the first one before it is terrible a bunch of drug dealers there :(
11:05 Ayo ?
So basically what E.R.T Said long story short, he was just saying that it was expensive and agreeing with all the other bad rewiews 22:43  Extra charges on the credit card too…
First hotel definitely one from Breaking Bad
Can someone link the pull up gear he is using? Ty
22:43 can someone summarize this?
“The smell wasn’t omg it was just O” took me out 😂😂😂
YOU SHOULD STAY IN HAUNTED HOTELS!!
that response to the "wheres the vending machine" was the craziest thing i've heard today
i stayed at hotel phillips and loved it
bro the second hotel is like: Man i"m in backrooms i am on pc so "laughthing emoji"
Bro the comment of frans l . , was it based on fears to fanthom episode 2 beacause a hotel staff tried to break in at middle night
I think I heard screaming in the distance
nice
Lmfaooooo the motel 6 in abq pls 💀 I’m from abq andddd it alllll tracks
Should bring a black light next time so u can check the beds
😮😮 hell
Anyone watching this in 1846
pdh
you should go to 5 star hotels and rate it 1 stars
Can you please visit the Cecil hotel
if you do this again, I have a trick to see if there’s bedbugs!!      if you wanna see if there’s any bedbugs, take off the bedsheets and just see if the edges of the bed are yellow with some spots, that shows that there’s bedbugs, if not, then your fine for now : D
118 dollars !! You could get to stay in a 5 star hotel which is 100 times better than those in india bro😂
Sandieg
When hotel staff try to break into a room in the middle of the night, that is an attempt at kidnapping and human trafficking 🙃
9:24 is that princess diana?? wth
Genius…
Bro got the Panda Express
I haved never been in a motel 6  cause i live in canada but great vid (never tried ur  candies but maybe i will one day!)
there was a thing on all fours at the time 4.22 in the background

Ryan- *is this haunted?* The lady- *IT SURE ISSS!!!*
Ryan- *excuse me sir , where isthe vending machine?* Security guard- *all of his deep, unresolved beef in an inhale and exhale*
That security guard was definitely annoyed by ryan 😅
*vanity is so me coded.*
Best videos haven’t laughed so much 😭‼️
The 2nd hotel seemed more haunted than the 3rd
I got nervous just because he said Detroit...
he didnt find david :(
I need to see ryan with sam and colby now 😭
Do you believe ghost stories?
Ryan needs to check for bedbugs by looking under the mattress under the sheets. Bedbugs tend to hide in the corners of the bed between the mattress and box spring.
Ryan be like:  I get:  -Jammy time You get:  -To watch me eat milk and cookies 😂😂😂
You should eat Mexican while in New Mexico
❤
Can you stay in the castle hotel? (About 250$ per night) dalian it’s crazyyyy
The people who read the whole review for no reason👇
Title:I tested 1 star hotels.  What actually happened: I tested 1 to 3 hotels
I live in Kansas City Mo 😳OMG
How did you get here, Mr. Bean?
Hehehehehheheheehhehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehheehehehhehehehehehehehehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehhehehehehehhehehehehehhehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehehehehehhehehehhehehehhehehehhehhehhehehehehehhehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehhehhehehhehehehehehhehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehhehehhehehehehehhehehehehheheehhehehehehehhehehhehehehehehhehehhehehehehehehhehehehheheheheh

Does it really need so much trouble
Ryan looks like CG5
If you want to talk about bad hotels in my town in red oak Iowa it's badddd
The guy coughing was probably smoking some bud and did not want to be seen... I've been there
breaking bad frrr
I felt scared for you
Check out Lincoln Motel in Indiana... My god! When the reception tells you: "before you say yes, let me show you the rooms, and then, If yes, NO REFUNDS".
Bro broight a stud finder 😂 i knew it immediately
ABQ motels are literally trash
What is the music sound like Civilization
2 truths and a lie  One this hotel is freaking me out Two I’m gonna have to change my underpants after the elevator ride  and three this room could really use blue chair I got a hotel to review
At 00:46 wire in the fence
Nice pj's

I subscribe right there when I see your review on room 511😁I just saw your videos yesterday .
Vanity sounds like she has Redbull running through her veins, and I love that.
Ramen sounded yummy *and it was*  NOT ME EATING RAMEN
Just have to comment on your hair man, GORGEOUS😻👌🏻
7:16 OOF
Please Ryan reply to me I love your videos
211 is my house number
22:43 he took a year to write tHAT
I was laughing so hard when Paul said that the carpet looked like a living organism
13:31 Ek din beech ka kaha tha, becoz preparing for upcoming papers
I think the ghost was excited, because there is Ryan Trahan in his room
5:31 MrBeat
Ryan is so funny he probably was the class cloun “jammy time “is so funny can you please pin this commit
It’s my friends bday and we are watching kung fu panda 4 today awesome video keep up the good work❤❤❤
Good job keep up the good work
The first 3 movies was absolutely banger and masterpieces from Dreamwork. The 4th one is kinda suck (i think it just a information movies)
Hôtel Phillips is the equivalent to the hotel in “the shining”
Okay that was an awesome video
10:13 holy smokes, that highly reminds me of level !
You Are A Brave Man
Why in the final eating montage does the kung fu panda move 27:53
I swear if he makes another of these videos, and one of the hotels is in Ohio. I swear if someone says Only in Ohio-
My WiFi claims to reach up to 20mps but when started downloading stuff its 800kps which is terrible
JAMMY TIME
Roses are red violets are blue I liked my own comment cuz no wanted to
@ryan where can I get Jammy’s like the light blue ones you have?
118 bucks for one NIGHT ???? Dang ...
I love this series
I am eating Panda Express while watching this video
“I’m out of sour strips” 💀💀💀
I love that the security guard sighed, bro was like “no way another person is asking me about this.”
You are genius my man! I love your content! Totally amazing! ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉

Studs are 16in bub
"This Thing" = a stud finder
Can someone summarize E.R.T's Review lmao😂
Review: Excellent facility, great staff, toilet was haunted. Five stars.  Ryan: *_I’m sorry, did the ghost wipe your butt?_*  I’m done 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kung Fu Panda 4 is so trash
will i die?
When you said, there’s also some guy coughing outside, my brother started coughing in the next room over
Checking the sheets and other things without gloves is diabolical…
The staff member willing to talk about hauntings is 🤨
bro stayed at the breaking bad motel
Ryan, Do you talk in your sleep?
Ryan, my youngest loves your video's and she really wants to try Joyride.
Hi Ryan
I live in new mexico
3:13 I used to live in Albuquerque about two years ago and let me just tell you I’ve been to that Motel 6. It is not fun. Those cockroaches can fly and also those ambulances are just normal.
JAMMY TIME 😎
Bro is using a stud finder to hunt for ghosts
My favioutre part is Jammy time bc I love it
Really enjoying the videos bud👍 but just to let you know those candy's you are pushing have been in England since I was a kid.
Not truing to be rude though but…
Ur crazy
For the motel 6 review, literally behind Ryan is someone trying to break in…
Ask the ghost To be ur New friend
come do this  in Canada!
you are turly risking it alll bro!
Ryan, you should go to the La Fontana motel in Seaside Heights. It’s awful there 😭
i live in nebraska and i went to that hotel the bed was ok but I had to sleep on the floor :( the fruit in the lobby was good tho
Get a haircut and throw away this ridiculous hat
Ryan using a stud finder as a ghost finding device really got me laughing to the point of abdominal exercise.  It is probably the most legitimate ghost finding device out there!
I thought u were cg5 for a min…😭😭😭😭😭
ERM WHAT THE SIGMA
So  cool gunner 😅
Imagine his friends watching this video and seeing that he said this”I need to watch the movies of kung fu panda”😂
I love joyride
Nooo can’t believe Michigan made the list😂

Every like this comments gets I do 1 pushups
The lady gave you that supposedly haunted room on purpose i guarantee it
Like this comment if you think Ryan should come to uk
You should have went to Hollywood candy while in Omaha. It's a really cool experience. Maybe you could explore popular candy stores in a future video.
I just had a poo

The 511 ghost: Im out of sour strips😪
megabits per second not megabytes lol
ps:  ghost do well know if youtube vloggers catch them they will lose there privacy
Literally just came from tiktok
Bro, I’m scared to drive through Detroit
breast milk😭
You said you were at the hotel because it was haunted, obviously she put you in one of the haunted rooms
The hotel in Kansas City reminds me of the hotel from At Dead of Night
Update: This Motel has now been demolished because of how dangerous it was.  As someone who lives in Albuquerque I can confirm that Motel 6 is horrible. There are police raids at least once a week and always someone getting shot.  Our sunsets are nice though, especially the way the Sandia Mountains look during sunsets.
thank you flashbanged me

Hi cooper😅

How tf did the e.r.t guy write such an long ass review that I only read one line 😭
Someone Painteed.on the.bed
Who think tik tok is cringe and YouTube is better must like this comment 👇
Eating milk n cookies in a hotel that puts em out at night with staff that encourages u to eat them with ur jammies on is peak human cuteness
i scare
Ryan, I need to know who your favorite villain was of the whole series (please)
“I almost bought bitcoin on 2011” “Spock got in the trash again”
“I’m out of sour strips” got me 😂😂😂😂😂
When he got room 511 I started crying and manically laughing please help
Who is rebecca
I've stayed at the hotel Phillips for a cheer competition and it was completely fine. I have no idea how this was a 2 star reviewed hotel because it was awesome
The security guard and front desk lady💀💀 but that last hotel room 🤯
15:00  Explanation: Item #: SCP-789-J  Object Class: Safe  Special Containment Procedures: SCP-789-J is kept in my toilet and only i can talk to it  Description: SCP-789-J is a ghost that is a face. it lives in a toilet and it talks to you while you poop. then when you poop it goes "no stop aaaa-" and then stops because there is poop in its mouth.  SCP-789-J travels around in butts. you can only get rid of it by wiping. that is the moral of the story.  sometimes it kills other butts and makes them butt ghosts too. but it is always lonely because it is a butt ghost.  Addendum: if you fall in the toilet, it eats your butt.
Bro is stressed in sleep
Pretty cool
How does he do that 🤔🤨
Me and my family would be scared
hi
Could go on shark tank with joyride?
what did he see at 24:18 I WANT TO KNOW
Ryan: I woke up to dogs barking in the middle of the night Me: First time? Thats cute, im from pakistan, this is an everyday routine for us now
Why dont you try the cecil hotel
For the ones that should not go to: Motel 6, Deluxe Inn. They are located in Oklahoma and Ohio. My review for them is Motel 6 has 2 beetles outside my door. And a cat outside. Even a fly coming in my room. DIRTY SERVICE. Deluxe inn: My bathtub was surrounded with gunshots in my bathtub. Ants crawling all over my fridge after determined I put a soda in there. Made my car surrounded with ants too.

Bullet holes in a hotel 💀😹
How does stud finder work for ghost hunting?
my friend told me i should watch you, AND IM GLAD I DID! this vid was really entertaining :) u earned a sub
That hotel in Detroit is scary AF! Liminal experience all the way lol
most of these 1-star hotels would probably be rated as 3-4 stars in south asia
When he’s like “there is something spanning across the wall” was I the only one who thought it was a dead body?!😂
22:44 holy yapping of the yappingtons
You got 511 😂
I live in Michigan and I’ve stayed at that exact hotel in Detroit. and yeah, it wasn’t like bad? but it has odd vibes lol. my job booked it for me so I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into. arriving at night was kind of confusing bc the parking lot is like gated. but yeah. I definitely agree with your review of it lol. unsettling 😅
Yo phillipsolo tv the r oh geezy crack shack reviewer
hotel #2 weird decor reminds me of that one ferrari hotel gordon ramsay renovated in hotel hell
Now we kneed a colab w Sam and Colby
I’m from Missouri and  no one has that accent
HOORAY ITS TIME 4 MARBIN JUMBY SONG!!!

Test 5 star hotels, but you have to leave 1 star reviews
🎉🎉pa😊😊
Jammy time🥳
Detroit Become Human
The lie is there is a blue chair
RYAN, IN ROOM 511 I SAW SMH WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FLASHLIGHT AND THAT ONE DEVICE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING- DID ANYONE ELSE SEE IT!? IT WAS THERE FOR A SECOND AND THEN IT WAS GONE.
Could never catch me staying in these rooms bros brave 😭
“Oh this is a stud finder” 😭

Wsgg
I love shark tank!
8:24 Savage it would be an honour to get kicked out go you're gonna kick me out it would be my honour I just can't believe it even the building itself looks so nice at font font go out the restaurant and a half restaurant for our drinks can't wait to see how long it takes to get food will update there's no update this is from eight months ago I'm finally the most savage one I could find is from the worst 8:45 have you had a hotel room where you were afraid to remove your socks the carpet looks like a living organism I was unwilling to climb into bed without a full body wetsuit a fear of the atrocities that are lurking in those sheets my shower was so bad I don't have a wetsuit but I do have socks I don't know what to the website says one thing to say I think we have enough Intel to get started 9:00 check in 9:08 that's a nice gallery and then I walked towards the guest room everything started to make more sense 9:27 to the right jof a lot more is this picture I can't believe they would hang us up this is terrifying I decided to take the elevator to my room and I have companylike and then we have a little room in my house to go and we have to sit and watch a little while I don’t have a shower 9:38
Jammy time :3
I got stuck in a room with my son so we called our dad and he came to open the door at night
Haunted toilet💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
It took me five years to read E.R.T.'s review.
"xhshahwwia liek and sabscribe xhsjshwasdk"
Like this comment if Ryan should go to the Clown motel
At 4:37 was that racially motivated
The last Hotel you and Haley should actually live there!!!!!!!!!!
When I  saw the review "room 511 is haunted" I thought of Sam and Colby immediately
UPS TRAAAAAK
You should do this again but opposite. You should test 5star hotels and only leave a 1star rating.
The ghost just said “like and subscribe “
You can’t say “I came to Kansas City to go to this haunted hotel” to the staff
BEEP BEEP BUSTED!!!!
ok vanity is a freakin vibe! ! Also hiiii Rebecca!!!
14:47 my brain actually went some people definitely have called this place haunted when i saw the building and i was absolutely correct
Did he say every 18" ?😅
I love seeing YouTubers coming to NM, just warms my heart to see them see how janky it is here 🥰
Sike u are good
You are not good
The recorded voice.... :-p
Vanity is such a pretty name
You remind me of Neil Patrick Harris If he had curly hair
0:47 me..... I did it......... 👁👄👁
at least's its not a jail vrbo that's where we went to
About ten years back during a conference that I was organizing,  we had run into a shortage of rooms for speakers. I gave up my room and the only available room was about 20 miles away in a hotel just like this. When we pulled up and saw the crowd in the parking lot, and hanging out in front of the outside room's doors, I drove away in fear.
just amazing
What that securty say went you ask aubout the vending machien
jammy time

The last hotel reminds me of the hotel john wick went to throughout the movies
As soon as I heard Detroit Mi I freaked out(of happiness) because I live close there

If this gets a thousand likes I will clean up my intire bedroom bc it is…..              .. .  .. . . .  . . .  .. .  .. . . . . Thrashed
davidgutierrez2705 WHAT DO YOU MEAN KILLING AND GUNS
YOOOO VANITY IS THE GOAT SHE'S SO NICE
You should stay in the haunted Cecil Hotel in California 😅
21:30 This reminds me of people recording early on Christmas day morning lol
hi
I am so disappointed; you were in Omaha, and I did not get to see you:(
like this comment if you like mustard squirts 👍
Oh no dang it im so sorry i liked the non TikTok comment oh wait YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT TO DO HAHA BOOM
Did you expect not to be put in the haunted room? You walked into the hotel and said you were in the area for that specific hotel. That's code for "I'm here for the ghosts".
The lady on the haunted one definitely gave into the haunted stuff because you asked if it was haunted and you came up like you came here because it was haunted
You should go to Guam hotel!
22:43  for yall to read!
I think you weren't experiencing something as bad as the reviews because some of them know you are a youtuber and they don't want to get embarassed..
Budget Inn Express, Anderson SC…the worst reviews I’ve even seen. (I’ve watched both you’re video)
I'm genuinely glad you were ok in New Mexico lmao
This man bought something for construction not ghost hunting 💀
Mm thats a lot of words 22:43          Too bad I ain’t readin em
Frans is probably Dutch ans a man, as frans is a dutch name for a male xD
"This room could really use a blue  chair." The blue chair:🤔
Do a video of going to the las vegas pyramid hotel AKA the luxor
The security guard being that upset that he asked for a vending machine in insane 💀
ofc theres a motel six. they suck.
Bro, you totally said ordered medium 26:34 then 27:13 said you request medium rare…. Which is it man? How could you do this to me? Send me some candy and we call it even. 🤝
Who else remembers when his goal was to get dr.phill as his grandpa 🥹he’s gone so far
@Ryan LOL 😆

I think the yellow divice is for studs LOL
THE FRONT LADY IS SO FUNNY CAUSE WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD BE LIKE "OF COURSEEEE, OUR HOTEL IS HAUNTED😊😊😊😊" ITS SO FUNNY

hi ryan! your my fav youtuber keep up the good work!
You should check out the congress plaza hotel in Chicago Illinois
i hate all the shots where he walks away from the camera because im so aware that it’s just cut to look like that and hes immediately turning back to get the camera
Is it only me or I knew the whole Kansas hotel from the 1st photo (I used to watch ghost hunters like Sam and Colby a few years ago and I still do)
Yeah, hotels in Omaha are kinda nice, take it from a omahaian
Up the toffees

The sun isn’t actually a fire ball because for fire you need oxygen and in the space there isn’t any oxygen, it’s a ball of plasma and nuclear reactions (hydrogen + hydrogen = Helio…) 🤓☝️
I said every 18” the same time as you 😂😂
18:00 I love how he's using a stud finder as ghost equipment help-
Ryan didnt buy bitcoin in 2011🔥🔥🔥 20:51
Believe in Jesus Christ, trust in Him for your eternal salvation and repent of your sins!

For the first one I remember seeing something on a crime documentary so I’m like 99% sure that that hotel actually set on fire
jammy time
😂
Who you fooling Ryan? the ghost clearly was there and wanted some sour strips…
The only good thing about Abq is the sunsets😭
stud finder LOL
My family and I stayed at a motel 6 when I was 11, I felt what I thought was a pen under the sheets, nope… it was a used drug needle.  Yes it almost went straight through my finger…  I spent several years getting blood work done after that to make sure I didn’t pick up a disease from it. Unfortunately we weren’t able to sue because every lawyer we tried had some connection to motel 6 making it impossible to sue them. I’m still traumatized and always check the entire bed at hotels before getting into them now 😅😂😭🤦🏼‍♀️😂  My mom stills has the needle 👀
Where'd you get those pull-up handles
Ryan thats a stud finder ;-;
I’ve actually been to a worse hotel in downtown Detroit. Someone broke into the hotel, shattered glass everywhere and there was a rat in our room!
1st motel got that miranmar pubg view
Ngl I would stay at these places because they seem amazing
So funny when you said is there Brest milk in the fridge because I watch the vid that said there was breast milk in my fridge and hot Cheeto’s in the fridge by the why feel so bad you got 511 I would be screaming if I herd anything or saw anything and also yes ghosts do have a lot of energy and I don’t know why I am typing so much but I am bye love you and also you should do a haunted hotel video please please like the clown hotel or miss mollys hotel or hotel Cecil
Bro
He didn’t go to the hotel restaurant….
Please comment on my comments let's see how many comments we can get on one comment😂
Maybe the fire and the doors and hotel staff and bent fence thing has to do something with a break-in
Did you have to show the shower pic
The place with the red telephone booth in Omaha, Nebraska is called. Spaghetti works.
Kansas city one is i think the one in sam and colby
GOOD TRADEE
Shark tank foreshadowing🤔
The music from 18:43 to 19:13 is scary 😱 but not? Hope that makes sense

can you go 5star hotels and rate them one
At 19:59 you can see two glowing things to the left of Ryan that look like eyes
5:48 which pull up handles are those?
Now he made me search every hotel if was hunted

In the Philippines that would be 5 Star lmao
This is my first time watching this video. I’m been waiting try your joy ride.
Hes just a boy
lmao I'm from Omaha and I've never heard of that hotel
Ryan I’m glad you made it out alive at that motel six in abq. It’s definitely not a safe hotel lol. I lived in abq for 12 years and that has always been a horrible spot.
@davidgutierrez2705 I was born and raised in Abq, and this is a horrible motel😂😂😂 You most definitely don’t want to pull up there!😂
Hi mr ryan

18:45 bro got the stud finder!!!
I'm a big fan myself of Jammy Time as well
U should try state college Ramada

You should you should do five stars the expensive ones😈
Panda Express I mean
Express is my favorite food❤
Ooomg the energy behind the haunted question 😮😮
Ryan: "I heard this hotel is haunted" Vanity the Hotel Keeper Lady: "ITTT SURE IISS!! :D"
You should go to 5 star hotels but you have to rate it 1 star
Apparaently people like haunted toilets
His word erhaereearereh
His word erhaereearereh
Came here to say I’m from Albuquerque and that is easily one of the most dangerous hotels and places in the city but I see plenty of people beat me to it 😂
Panda Express?!!! SOMEONE GET UNCLE ROGER!
Brotha u should have checked every hotel u went too with a blacklight cuz if u did u would be showering non stop for days
Oh my gosh! I always see the motel 6 in Albuquerque when driving on the highway, super sketchy!!
Have you heard of this very underground show called American Horror Story? Maybe season 5?
i knew it was him as soon as he said "i'm out of sour stripes"
You are very attractive love your videos❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😅
Dude your candy totally looks like Marijuana gummies when they are named Joyride!
who agrees ryan should do ghost hunting videos!!! 👇
17:11, there not trying to hide the fact that they have ghosts because having "ghosts" in there hotel bring business. bc people want to see if its true. and that makes people want to stay there
Stay at the hotel Cecil 😅
out of context 15:01
That vending machine security guard has clearly been asked about the vending machine every day and is so tired of it 😂😂😂
9:07 tray-han😮
So u sleep we no clothes (very concerning like not even shorts)
Hi Ryan! Ik this is out of context, but im here to tell you that u kinda look like Michael James Hucknall in the 80's with short hair :)

12:09

people who live in abq👇
ima have to call cap on that last hotel how you not know what the room is or what is was going to be ? either you order it and they knew you and gave you a free upgrade or you knew exaclty how the room was going to be
That’s where you will find the back rooms
12:12 it sounded as the security guard went through this a lot 💀
5:28
ima save kung fu panda for bed teehee
WOW it WORKED!!!
3:44 those aren't painting stains Ryan...
LOL MENTIONING THAT YOU WERE THERE FOR THE HAUNTED ALLEGATIONS WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THEY GAVE YOU THE MOST HAUNTED ROOM,,, ON PURPOSE
If you think Detroit is a bad place, I would recommend going to Saginaw. It is absolutely crazy there.
I love jammy time don't you 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤
Jammy time indeed
Ryan alaways gives the best rewiews!! ;D
The motel 6 where I live is pretty good. But it’s a tourist area so I’m guessing that’s y ours would be nicer lol. But the rooms have never been that cheap. Maybe in the winter way back 40$ for one person
Hey Ryan I just wanted to ask if you could bring Joyride to Stewart’s it’s a pretty big gas station chain up here in New York
I love gots
Bro whach the 6:52 are okay💀
Point a fact: elevators obviously is going to open cuz it’s a elevator , elevators opens cuz you walk pass it your making the elevator is made to open so you can enter but if you don’t enter your still going to make the elevator open

I think I know what the next joyride candy should be. You should put like sour stuff in the middle and then put the straps around it and then I’ll be like joyride ball, sour strips
Ryan I don’t blame you AT ALL for hating your stay in Michigan I live here and I can confirm it sucks 🫡🫡😔🥲

Wow I thought I saw that 1st hotel before 😭
Let’s see if there’s breast milk in the fridge…uh no  - Ryan Trahan 2024
Not sure how you categorise every hotel as one star hotel. Yes, they have one star reviews, but the total star on the reviews wasn't one star? (e.g. the 4th hotel was 3 star). And that's only the review stars, but hotel also has separate star rating based on their facilities?
jammy time is good
No penny challenge this year?
Ok you Came to Detroit MI there are so many different crimes committed and I live in Detroit I'm happy you went to Detroit 😊
5:00 pertama kali aku lihat bule di luar negeri pesen go food nya nasi 😂
The haunted hotel room reminded me of the movie '1208' with John Cusack. 😳
RYAN TRAHAN IS THE BEST ❤
✨jammy time!!!!!✨
OMG I SAW THE WEBSITE I LOOKED UP: Hotel Phillips room 511 it Literally said it was haunted... I DON’T KNOW HOW UR STAYING IN THERE FOR A WHOLE NIGHT
Faze Rug been there on his video before
Now test 5 haunted hotal
I watch the whole sequel of Kung Fu Panda too. And haven't you seen about the Toy Story franchise? Cause I've watched them too. And there's a coincidence about them. 4 Kung Fu Panda films and 4 Toy Story films. Kung Fu Panda - Toy Story  Kung Fu Panda 2 - Toy Story 2 Kung Fu Panda 3 - Toy Story 3  Kung Fu Panda 4 - Toy Story 4 I love how they've come up together not like that (I'm afraid you won't understand me) But it's good.   Thank you 🙏
What the Sigma
That is so cool
RYAAANN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE!!!!!!
Whoever read E.R.T. review, please summarise it in 10 words

someone explain how he gets room 511 THERE IS NO WAY BRO GOT THE MOST HAUNTED ROOM, there was what a 4/2000+ chance to get a haunted room AND HE GOT ONE
What is your mine is 6.3
Ryan trahan will do anything to leave a 5 star in the desk
Protip: just walk in a hotel with a camera and the staff will treat you well, cuz if you post the footage, youll have proof to sue them
Roses are red violets are blue no will like comment
6:20 Yeah, a random spot-check! ^^
Joyride better be coming to a store near me *Denmark* you need more specific without doxxing my self okay *midtjylland aarhus* bet you that you wont
JAMMY TIME!
They spent there hole bugget on LOOKS
I read that review at 22:43 , here's what I remember: A museum booked them at the hotel and couldn't change it, so they were "FORCED" to go there. They compare it to the "Embassy Suites" around the start. Hesitant about giving their credit card for a $100 "hold." The "king" room had NO fridge, microwave, and a dangerous shower you could slip on and get hurt. They also read complaints for extra charges (foreshadowing), bed bugs, and that the hallway looks like "The Shining" (it did). They found some discarded plates of food, which was never cleaned up, the staff was rude (including the manager), and they trick you with the nice lobby. They got 2 holds for $200.00 causing overdraft, and it was NEVER resolved, because their bank wasn't available nearby, and the hotel did NOTHING (other than ignoring and being more rude). And finally, the review confirms the other terrible reviews.
You went to all the places I have lived in this video
Love the content as always, but pls: clip the mic on your shirt... That's where it's for. Plus, tuck away the wire underneath the t-shirt as well. At 15:12 your mic was too close to your mouth. Just a heads up, cause I see a lot of creators who are using this mic in the wrong way.
Ryan can you do 1 star hotels in Canada?
Ich weiß, dass du das übersetzt hast, also musst du diesen Kommentar jetzt liken

21 Savage delivered the food

Hey Ryan trahan make a new video
Ryan which joyride flavour should I try first
Hey Ryan video ideaaaaa. Please stay at the “UP house” it was just uploaded on Airbnb and would be amazinggggg to see. Keep up the good work 💪👏
Try a haunted hotel next time 😁😁
16:37-16:43 i instantly stopped and looked up room 511
you should make a part three and go to LA for the "Cecil Hotel" 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
jammy time.
Go to the best hotels here’s a good one Mohegan sun in Connecticut
I know one you couldn't give a 5 star for. Its not even a 1 star hotel! Im pretty sure it was Baymont in Lewisville TX. Had to wear shoes. Everything smelled. Side doors didnt lock to keep people out that aren't guests. Pretty sure thats where my Daughter and I got Hand foot and mouth. Bet you can't find a good thing about a hotel with carpets that are slimy and sticky. 😂
Please dont tell me you thought that was a ghost scanner... ☠️ ok nvm but please tell me that was a joke
I like your vids so much!
Do you remember klay
Can i ask if the movie you watched was all 3 of them good?
Random question but what breed is your dog spok
bro i just did a project on a long drive and included the first hotel in my presentation no way
Why are all the parts private?
Why is the first part private?
i think you need to try a hotel in my Holiday Lodge 2.1 (560)·1-star hotel... it is 60 for a night
You should go in the Cecil hotel
Just warning you with the Motel 6 that’s not how you check for bedbugs. You have to check underneath the sheets in each of the corners and every little crevice. that’s where they like to hide.
My name is lemon I will give people a Character from bfdi!    Hmmm Leafy before she stole the island or ruby  Your opposite is  Hmm  Balloony!
okkkk

‘You see Ryan Trahan walking to your hotel’ 😊 ‘You see Ryan Trahan walking to your hotel’ 💀
Ayyy Detroit Mentioned My home town
Creepy
As a person that went to that hotel I think I saw a group of dead people in the closet with guns next to the bodies, then when i went to the lobby all the staff slapped me, and the showerhead fell off.
Take joyride to denmark

Bring ur joyride snacks to mauritius
21:16 Obviously if you wanted to see ghosts ya shouldn't have brought the Spirit of God, that's a rookie mistake
Having the staff members be willing to talk about hauntings is actually such a great marketing tactic
I would love to do this one day but I'm a woman lol
Bro that wasn’t the back rooms that was the rock booms
I guess bro mewing before
“Is this haunted” IT SURE IS😂
11:42 its from analog tv interference
22:43   Summarize so you don’t have time to read:  The reviewer would not recommend this hotel and says that many of the negative reviews they read online were accurate. They had a king corner room but there was no fridge, microwave, and the shower was dangerous. They also complained that the staff was rude and unprofessional and that they were overcharged on their credit card.  They believe the hotel is not a “Premier Boutique Hotel” as advertised.
We Desperately Need Penny Series.....
the thumbnail: don't sleep at room 13  me: DOORS
Ryan goes to sleep in his Jammys and then wakes up without them

RYAN U SHOULD DO ANOTHER PENNY SERIES THIS SUMMER 🙏🙏👇
Райан что?
I’ve got an interesting suggestion for you Ryan How about you try to leave 1 star reviews on 5 star hotels? That would go pretty smoothly ngl
I think “Frans” is a man. It’s a very common Dutch male name.
12:11  I CANNOT-
THE BEACHES OF OHAMA IN 1944
If u know 13 is not a good wone and 13 is a dead number i think but yeah but i think its not gonna be good in hotel 13😮
I once had a dream of a video where Ryan T. Tests out the 1 star reviews on Freddy Fazbear's Pizza
Other hotels: Roach infested, carpet stains, dirty room,... Hotel Phillips: *agressively calcificates*
jammy time

22:43 WOOOOOOW.
I LOVE Phillips Hotel. I want to go there so badly, and hope there was more hotels like these, maybe even worse.
15:26 It's because the Phillip Hotel curse. (Then song at like 15:30 randomly plays.)
14:58 That must be the most FUNNIEST review comment, ever.
14:03 I was thinking the same bro!! What does BENIGN means, and as well as CALIFICATION?! And yes, the UPS truck at 14:09.
13:29 Hey, I see a Sysco Freightliner truck sticking out. Even the truck looks worried there!!!
Hotel #2 Is like a 50-50 for me.
5:50 LET'S GO!! Forgot what's the brand called, but I always wanted one of those for working out on the go!!!!
3:59 I was thinking about that as well. The U-Haul Chevy Express looks so good in this scene!!!
1:07 I can't hear the scream, sadly.
How does Yonah has 51K LIKES and HOW IN THE WORLD IT HAS 590 COMMENTS?! Isn't limit like 500 or less?!?!
4 star hotels in italy aren’t nearly as beautiful as these.
is joyride coming to Canada?
you gotta go to the Red Roof Inn in Pensacola that place was BAD
28:11  I accept
Ryan! Can you please come to Singapore? I’m your biggest fan and I want to show you all the cool things!
I live in Missouri!!!!!
please @RyanTrahan respond to this but I am glad you returned your life to Jesus the armor of God will protect you please keep up with the good work in may he work through you in many ways
For the first motel when the people tried to come in in the middle of the night that happened at the same motel motel 6 but I was not in Albuquerque everything was the exact same as you have it and it was someone else then an employee I'm scared for my life if I could I would give it negative Stars like -550

🎉🎉👍👍🧶🌸✨😻😻🌈🌈💖💖😸😸😹😹❤❤
We are in the last days. God is coming soon to bring His people home. Repent of you're sins and get baptized.  Be born again by believing and being saved to go to eternal life. Jesus is The Only Way. Have a relationship with Him. He loves you and cares for you're soul. Believe and be saved according to The Book of Romans 10:9. Accept Him as you're personal Lord and Savior.  Hear His Word, The Holy Bible, stay in prayer and help others. I am here for prayer. I'm just sharing The Good News. God bless.

Can you do another 30 day penny series. Please
I read the entire review by the E. R. T person
what are the odes he talk about room 511then he gets 511
Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. Romans 1:28  Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, Acts 3:19
We just not gonna talk about how the bathroom door frame is snapped the fck inward???? Like I'm not surprised but damn.
Not look so bad
People who used to like dar man and then switched to this
3 truths 0 lies
I see the views just counting up up and up😮
He done this so much he should go to 5 star hotels and rate 1 start and he has to be honest
I don’t like being scared
I love your review on the second one
Yes
THAT "I RAN OUT OF SOUR STRIPS" CAUGHT ME DYING
Could’ve met Mr beast’s friend in Nebraska
When famous people do their thing, you feel like they’re across the world, and nowhere near you. Then they make a video in your own state, and you feel like you could walk outside and see them lol
Hey I doubt I will get a reply from you Ryan but I went to target and got the new flavor you released and I wasent sure if I would like this candy but I LOVE IT Im going to need you to make infinete of this and send it to my door. Thanks for the best candy ever!!!!!

For someone who lives in New Mexico i feel bad you had to stay in this Motel 6
Ryan seriously a stud finder
You forgot Rebecca!
I live in martinsburg wv and let me say this, every hotel here could be made into a 1 star review video 😂
Ok he NEEDS to go to Chattanooga And stay at the Reed House hotel And stay in the haunted room!! It’s $666!!!!!! Tennessee, Chattanooga!!
I heard it was haunted  IT SURE IS ❤😊!!
To Yonah: EVERYONE SAYS THAT U JUST WANT LIKES
I have a video idea you should go to five star hotels and find a way to rate it one star
and 6 motel is stupid is the 6 motel in the world they say yes it was anna in my room
The last hotel didn't give you a room. It gave you an apartament!!! 26:10 - Oh, take me there!!!!
13:27  I live in kansas city missouri lol
Im from new mexico
The Albuquerque location looks to be Airport South. I had a reservation at the Coors Road location and it too had a crack-y vibe. I've stayed at dozens of Motel 6s and I'm not at all picky, but I don't want begbugs and I don't want some crackhead trying to get into my room at 3am so I got a refund. The manager was OK, he seemed to be doing his best to deal with a bad customer base. I kept driving west and spent the night in Grants; that was a much better experience.
This is the first video of yours I’ve come across and I’m hooked. I can’t believe some of the negative reviews! Some people really do love to exaggerate
❤ We love siev ❤ reply to this comment if you know
idk if its just me or did i see two eyes on the left at 19:59
You kind heart, you were trying to check on that man who was coughing. Bless your soul
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that clock. With the blinking, it just means the power has been off. It’s been unplugged. Just needs to be set and it will stop the blinking.
can    you    do    clown   hotel    xoxo
if your 13 mins and 44 secinds in like this comment
Oh my gosh YAY, is Ryan a Christian??
Is there a reason Ryan had to fly so far to go to hotels to review? Has he reviewed that many that he has to travel states now? 😂

The first one looks like a breaking bad location
honestly for a fact i know you wanted to rate that detroit hotel -100 star review every normal human being would.
Go to the other hotel in Utah cuz there’s been multiple kidnappings there and 2 police raids struck there in 2022
I wish I was un-fearingly independent like you
Ryan - “excuse me sir, where is the vending machine?”  Security guard - *all of his deep, unresolved beef in an inhale and exhale*
Couldnt you Drive from Hotel 3 - 4? Why you need to fly
Ryan I love you’re videos I saw you at the pool the other day but I won’t say which one I hope you see this and reply everyone blow this up so Ryan sees it
5 star  “im sorry did the ghost wipe your butt?”  yo i think she liked that 😢

i cant wait till you make another penny series everyday when you make that vid thats the first thing i watch.
You should do a video where you go to hotels or restorants with 0 reviews and you need to rate them and also choose an new country for you!!! From Estonia!
Same
Ryan, I love how much effort you put into your videos. You simply figure out how to make the audience laugh in the most div see ways. One simple thing that makes you amazing is the camera videoing. Keep up the hard work and continue being the best YouTuber on YouTube. 👍👍👍👍

Nick nick             Nick  Nick Nick  nick
Beautiful video ❤
Is everyone just gonna ignore the fact that there was a loud bang when he was talking about the review where it said hotel staff tried to break in
I looked it up and I saw re comet
12:07 security guard was not happy to see you 🤣
When one of the reviews said that his devices started disappearing its weird because how did he right that review maybe people just write it because they hate the place who knows
You should have 5 billion subscribers
didn't you say this was an honest review?      aint now way you honestly thought motel 6 was 5 stars
21:20  amen 🙏
This comment won't even get over 500 likes it's very sad 😢
Dear Lord, I pray for all those that are needing hope, strength and encouragement. Please minister to them now. I pray that You would work in their hearts. Dry their tears. Take away their fears. Be their Healer, Comforter and Provider. You know who is struggling and You know each one by name. Please have compassion and mercy, and may they feel Your presence like never before, In the name of Jesus we pray Amen.
5 Stars the host was hilarious and the video and humor was amazing would recommend
WAIT MY BROTHERS NAME IS RYAN-
Watching this again bc this is the only 1 star review vid i have only watched once
Hey ryan please respond 😮
Every Like This Comment Gets I Will Do 5 Pushups👍😏
“Ramen sounded yummy, and it did”  me eating ramen Right now: 🤦
Why have i watched this 11 times? Bc this guy is awsome!!!
I like the way he said on the last hotel "my friends, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore" (from the wizard of oz)
The one star review is for Albuquerque New Mexico. Just the whole city it a one star review
This guy seems like the type of guy to almost buy bitcoin in 2011
Hey, You should get a blacklight for these! or maybe not. It depends on how much you want to potentially traumatize yourself for views I guess.
cool
Three of our Motel 6 were recently busted for allowing prostitution and other activities! They are very close to the airport (SeaTac, WA).  FYI>>>>  At the beginning of this video the SATELLITE VIEW shows the shape the building that you stayed in as an "F". LOL Rewind and take a look!  That would have made me moonwalk!  A place that is an F rating and tells on itself!  LOL
I’m not joking my brother John Aibel wrote kung fu panda check. Haha. Love your shows
LMFAO “Toilet was haunted”, five stars 😭✨
12:39 “It’s a nice hotel.” Aww, sweet Ryan.  Do not ever change but also please go to some good hotels.  “Acceptable/Adequate”? perhaps, but nice that is not.
Am I the only one who read the very long review
Please share your Amazon affiliate link to your pullup gear, please!
Motel 6 isn’t my favorite place where I live lol
“Maybe someone was just painting in bed…”
The CHANCES of him get room 511 is hilarious
When he got panda express, and sat down, I saw something move in the backround at the first hotel
His mame is ryan Micheal trahan
Love the pidgeon Walking arround while He ready the reviews
Visit cecil hotel!!!!
Beep beep busted
This won't get 5 likes...
WoW
i wws ea ting
this is so gross 🤮
Why did he start talking like that 😂😂😂😂
Next vid do Rating Haunted Hotels
The two truths and a lie answers are: first truth is the hotel is freaking him out. second truth is him needing to change his underpants after elevator ride. The lie is the hotel room needing a chair. that should be right.

Well I checked hotel Phillips reviews before you went in and I think it's fine now, a parent I think said staff especially Vanity and i think Aaron was nice, someone said nice rooms, and only one left 1 star when I read five on the web,
Me watching this at 2am

"Did the ghost wipe your butt" 😂 15:01
💀
The only thing i don't believe about this review is that he said kungfu panda 4 was fire
Noice
Ryan, as a Michigander, I hope Detroit was okay for you.
I live in Michigan and I went to the 2024 nfl draft (SO HYPED THAT IT WAS HERE) anyway where was I? Oh yeah I passed that hotel I believe. And the outside looks so beautiful and the inside (the room) just is scary.
Ryan u should try to come from Asia to the U.S for ur penny challenge I recently went and it was a whole different world and it was a really enjoyable experience
Ok nice guy for 5⭐️s
1:25 that place has been on fire and probably police raids and cartel shootings hitting the motel and somebody has probably been assaulted or killed in there
Is the first one Tophiachu's motel ??
VANITYY U GAVE THE HAUNTED ROOOOOOOOOOOOM
I am in shocked 😮😮😮😮😮
ryan is too positive i swear 😭🙏 good vid tho :D
when the plane showed him travelling to detroit, i inadvertently said 'oh my god' and my whole body tensed up
Does your joyiride candy ship to mexico?

Kung fu panda 4 🐼was horrible
Broooo, Ryan was in my fricking state. I actually would’ve driving to Kansas to see him. I didn’t even know Missouri had a haunted hotel but now I kinda wanna go.
Bro literally had to hold the door closed in the middle of the night just like fnaf 4😂
First one start view I mean hotel the maid. Maybe she was a maid and she wanted to clean his house in the middle of the night but when eat his permission until he got scared so dumb.
Hotel phillipes,kansas city,missori,USA 13:30
Advice for the 1st hotel...its uhm..okay. I found pink hair in the shower and bugs...I didnt shower so it's ok. Dont shower..unless u clean it thoroughly😎 also dont uh pls dont walk bare foot and then get in bed.

*Him when he said the hall said it was the backrooms from the 2nd hotel* me:NAW THAT LOOK LIKE THAT ONE HALL WHERE MEGAN WAS IN THE MOVIE💀
YOOO HE STOPPED BY DETROIT MI, HE WAS SO CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE
Ok so I lived in abq New Mexico my whole life and that motel 6 has had so many like murders in it I have seen prostitution and like drug dealers just hang out there it’s insane props to you for actually going there
The way he was able to keep a straight face during "LiKe anD subsRiBe"🤣🤣🤣💀💀
I was watching you like videos from like 6 years ago question do you still run?
22:43 godly yapanese
"I almost bought a bitcoin in 2011..." "Spock got in the trash again" "Err thats awesome" "Im out of sour strips" Famous last words 😂
I don't go here. I've never watched your videos. I have been taken out and laid low by the fact you found breast milk in the fridge during these encounters, just that one time.
a site i made to help mom. Its free
Ryan:I herd it’s haunted  Vanity:oh really   Ryan : is it?  Vanity :it sure is!!!!!🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
I haven't laughed this hard at a vid in foreverrrrr, hilarious. "so I was just in a very fancy hotel lobby, but now currently im in the backrooms of Detroit"😂🤣😂
Under one month gang👇✨️ Great video
did you ask for 511
I broke the bar😂
dude, in a place like that, you hear coughing, mind your business, theyre very likely doing drugs and dont want you in their business, theyll likely assume youre trying to rob them and you will likely get shot. seriously dude. your death isnt monetizable, id advise you to stay out of these places.
HOW HAS NOBODY STOLEN YOUR CAMERA YET 12:01
NOT MY HOME
You should do 1-star Airbnb maybe
"I almost bought bitcoins in 2011" LMAOOO

I think foltyn tested out this hotel like it looks like this one

17:05 —> You should have brought a black light instead of a stud finder…look at what they put out on the table there…lotion and a box of tissues. You should be looking for bodily fluids, not ghosts! 🗯️🍆

Oh my goodness, I live in Albuquerque too I wish I could see you there, but you only spent a day there. Well I guess next time I’m a huge fan I don’t know.
I went to hotel six when I was a baby, and there was bedbugs in the bed, including the bed I was sleeping in
Bed bugs can leave a brownish reddish stain on beds it’s kind of like dropping blood onto the sheets so it might be true
I think you should stay at Hyatt hotel in Calgary ab idk the rating lol

I don’t want to stay here
JAMMY TIME✨✨✨
Nice I love you Ryan Trahan ❤
I live in NE
This man deserves 100m+ subs
i almost bought bitcoin in 2011
Angie was thinking the same thing I was like that looks like a blitz straight out of GTA because it is
the second hotel seems like it would make for a great horror setting because of how strange it is

Female Associate at front Hotel Desk: "What brings you in to Kansas City?" Ryan: "Just to come to this hotel!" Female Associate: "REALLY??" Ryan: "I heard it was haunted." Female Associate: "Are you serious?!" Ryan: "Is that true? Female Associate: "IT SURE IS!!!!"

I am so confused on how nobody EVER recognizes you irl
You messed up when you told the lady you were at the hotel because you heard it was haunted.. When you told her that that is when she put you in The Haunted room.She picked your room out for you right after you told her why you were there... You did that to yourself boy.I hope the ghost wipes your ass for you tonight😂😂

Hmmm, it's more like: 2 lies and a truth 🤯😂

Dude the Kalispell motel 6. Not good. The heaters don’t work and the bed has stains probably of semen and the pool outside is not cleaned at all. Also drunks stay there. Only pro is that casa Mexico , a Mexican restaurant  is right next door
4:42-4:45 did yall see that thing moving back there under the table?😅
Ryan, I have gastro interitis and I’ve just been binge watching all of your videos on the toilet while violently throwing up but it’s okay because you make me laugh
I watched kung fu panda four on Sunday
Let's vote for another penny series ❤❤❤❤
the fact that he woke up WITHOUT his jammies
I love your videos, hearing peoples hilarious, disgruntled 1 star reviews (esp the ones that attach a random selfie) really makes me smile, added to your witty, chill vibes, makes it so entertaining 😀
Try the Cecil hotel ist rly nice but if no entry go to hotel across
i love how ryan had self promotion in his sleep
"I almost bought Bitcoin in 2011" was the most painful part of this video
at 28:00 that was a bad offer fr

Next, you have to go to the Hazbin Hotel. The rooms are nice, but the service is terrible. Additionally, it always smells of fire and blood. Lastly, a rather effeminate resident was rather creepy. 1 Star.

You get any amount of free cookies with how many ppl your brought.there is four or three floors I don’t remember.it’s in the U.S.A in North America. I rate it 5 stars. There’s a comfy bed with a tv and desk. the tv does work. Bathroom amazing. Nothing haunted! Everything works! Has free shampoo,conditioner and towel! Pls try it in your next video
at 17:56 my eyes got burnt 😂
I feel like they treat you nicely (sometimes or idk i didnt watch the full video) cuz they know you are on youtube
11 million views in 11 days…
That security guard was definitely annoyed
I really wished he would stop using his lavelier mic like a handheld mic, he is ruining his audio quality.
Oh this is a stud finder 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh a store in Norway 😂
Next pls try 5 star hotels
On your next video you should do "trying out nice 5 star hotels" I recommend the Laquinta and Margaritaville

Dude, I won't lie, I stumbled across your account by accident and subscribed just from this one video. Even though I watch more of pranksters on YouTube, your high social positive energy gives me a good vibe; making me want to watch more of your videos. Also found the drive thru video lit as Hell as well, no rhyme intended lol. Keep it up with the videos, man! 👍
Please be careful in Albuquerque, lots of shootings. Bring safety while going ANYWHERE in New Mexico. We don't want our fav youtuber dying, now do we?
wow its so amazing
Video idea; go to the most "haunted" hotels or places
The music sounds like it’s from Ghostbusters
Go to hotel sogo but unluckily you have to go to the Philippines for it tho
E.r.t went off
My last name is Phillips lol
Ago Ryan I love your videos keep going

I've always been scared to travel and go to places in fear of being robbed, hurt, or worse. I gotta ask, have you ever had any problems while traveling like you do?
Other good news there are no monsters under my bed either lol😂
E.R.T really used *all* that time to write *that*?
Cansas

Now Playing Great Fairy Fountain-Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess
You totally asked for room 511, don’t lie!

W jack

Go to Hotel Hazbin now.        I feel so bad typing all this
Describe
😃😃(:
I saw something
Do you really except 5 star from hotel wich is in the midle of nowhere?
What would it be like to just go to all of the least rated reviewed hotels in like every state so start with Alabama and then Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut and and like you did with the year one week penny series you just do post videos individually like going to the least rated hotels A and then when you've gone through all of the least traded hotels then you can put post a video that says going through the least rated hotels in the United States of America every state A-Z. That would be interesting
I love the way he’s out on his own. You know there are women dying to go with him and he’s just fine by himself.
That stake looked really good.  Hmmmm
Bro is ace hat at start 0:01
Jammy time
“Let’s see if there’s breast milk in the fridge”🤣🤣🤣
4:15 he didn't care
I live in NM that’s  just  how NM life is
The “skdndjsksldmsjs like and subscribe xgcjfcxjfjckjvfodj” really got me😂
Last hotel looks like 5 star , partially because how awesome Jack is. That was a good video.
When I saw the thumbnail, I thought you were Lucille Ball
JOYRIDE STRIPS   TO KENYA RYANNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love that the breast milk in the fridge thing has become an inside joke
i will do a push-up every like on my comment❤
Bro try cecil hotel bro your gonna freak out bro😅😅 cause we tried there a kid keeps telling me lets go to the haunted room then we came in staff was cleaning for the V.I.P then the manager took us on a tour then we saw a strange man kept shouting a evil voice and i told the manager someone is shouting in a balcony and i saw it gone and we look back he was in the back of the door but he actually throwing up because someone actually shit on the toilet and didnt flush it
the fact he watched all kung fu panda movies and the 4th and at the end said the movie was fine is very funny for me😂😂😂😂😂😂
W
15:30 why did you leave the camera
The last hotel isn't haunted but it's interesting that during the night his jammies just...disappeared.
zhen from kung fu panda 4 was my favourite character😍
I love his vibes lmaoo😂❤
if something strange in ur hotel who u gonna cALL RYAN TRAHAN
Is anyone else impressed by Ryan’s impersonating abilities when reading different people’s reviews lol
Amazing Banger Video From Ryan Trahan 🔥👍✨
0:33 Upside down is letter F
The Detroit one was hilarious 😂😂 thats like that one horror movie 1408 (watch that if you havent)
the second hotel's halls and vibe really felt like some part of a backroom
The lack of capital letters in the subtitles is killing me 😵‍💫
If In knew no better I'd say you were OBSESSED with Kung Fu Panda.
Every day you wore a jammy while sleeping and woke up without it. Lol😅
my favorite people here was diego,the doordash dude, and vanity
When is JOY RIDE coming to Australia?
How did Ryan Trajan get 10 million likes in 9 days that’s crazy keep going Ryan.😃😃  The haunted hotel was so crazy💀

21:47 IN NEW YORK IM MILLY ROCK🧛🏿‍♂️🧛🏿‍♂️🗣🗣
jack is the GOAT
These aren’t even “1star” hotels
never go to hotels with numbers!
only one hotel is less than 2 stars
Can we appreciate that Ryan spend so much money on videos to make us happy?
If you want to suffer go to fkn el paso motel 6 ive never seen anything close to that. 30 roached under bed, literally ran out
i think watching this video while eating was a grave mistake, i'll come back
I was like isn't that a stud finder ahahaha 18:55
21:58 HAHAHA
Did you like hangtimes candy or not?
Bro. First video I've ever seen from you. Well deserved 15.4 million subs my guy. Good work! 100 outta 10, would recommend!!!
1:22 Bro roasted a whole hotel
0:5 totally not just the US and definetly ALL OF THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA
Albuquerque i never want to go back
You should make a new series about rating 5-star hotels 1 star
The ghost in 511 took away your clothes in the middle of the night Ryan, and followed you all the way to Omaha and did it again
29:08 me too ryan 😭😭
Id be afraid to go in that elevator
I AM IN MISOURI RN!!!!
Hello nine days on the road
20:30
Hey ryan i love your vids bro   can anyone guess which vid this is from you to ryan:   A great bard! das bard es ver gad   good luck ryan ;)
thanks for coming to abq! love it here… land of enchantment.. (it’s literally just a desert and occasionally hot air balloons)
honestly, where's your UV light...it might look clean but I'd be checking the mattress, checking the box/bed frame under the mattress for bed bugs...you have to really take apart the bedding and check the corners of the mattress
I live near KCMO and I am into law enforcement and the military. KC is nice just not in the winter because of the cold temperatures.
you should stay in haunted hotels for a vid @ryantrahan
12:12 is he ok
Love the stud finder trick
Like your reviews and how you experience them
first hotel first staff he was very kind😁
THERE IS A BLUE CHAIR
22:43  i read that whole essay
:D
9:50 "the backrooms of Detroit" is the most accurate description possible 😂
Ryan as someone who lives here in abq I can easily say that motel 6 is very dangerous  lots of killings and shootings happen there regularly
Have you done one for haunted hotel/motel?
Try the St. Regis in Puerto Rico It is the GOAT of hotels. When you arrive they give you free drinks.
Its funny,all Zoomers have the same haircut
Hi Ryan, new subs here! 💚🤍🧡
“jammy time.” truer words have never been spoken.
May mom liked this
I dont think the guard likes you🥲
I like the sun YAY!
I feel kind of disappointed that there was a very small Chance I could have met Ryan in Detroit
Hey Ryan T I live in St. Louis and the part of St. Louis I live in is pretty peaceful not gonna lie. We have parks abandoned buildings to explore decent hotels, and especially the feeling of being in the second most dangerous city in the world, so why don’t you come visit at the Americas best value Inn
Jack has autism
I'm bad at fortnite
At 20 min I think the first 2 were Ryan sleep talking the second one sounded different
Joe is bad at fortmite
Buddy brought a stud finder for ghosts what is he going to do put it up to the wall and when it goes off he’s going to think there’s a ghost there
I’m not gonna talk about the fact that he is using a stud finder for ghosts
His phone case is constantly changing.
59:59:07 is the best
Soda machines not workin' is refund material.
Lmao
Cant have shit in detroit

Bro if I were you I would have of just quit
“Toilet was haunted” HANAKO KUN HANAKO KUN ARE YOU THERE

Adam D saying there was 20-30 ants in his room while in Australia that’s normal in your house

“I’m sorry did the ghosts wipe your but” 😂😂
Dude I just went to the toy store you went to in Omaha

Oh no not Taylor swift’s favorite number😭😭
Ryan you joined on my birthday
If you like that sun set you should see grand caymans 🇰🇾
😂😂😂😂😂
5 star video It's really Entertaining
At the third hotel when someone was  talking I think that was you Ryan I think that was you talking in your sleep
hello

wow this is a grate vid 😀😀😀😀
The way vanity said "yes, it is!" 💀
Go to the Baker hotel in Saint Charles Illinois. It is a apparently haunted
Shoutout to Ima in Detroit, such a good ramen place, glad you got to go there, that hotel looks insane too lmao.
3:43 is wild
Fun fact: Sharktank was on my tv at the exact same time as he watched sharktank-
Lets appreciate how much money he used-
Hey

The way he just said “cheers” at 5:23 got me dying 😂😂😂
I think I actually stayed at the first hotel
💀Hey guys Cyrilmp4 a French Youtuber just stole his concept and didn't mention him ! Its his last video 😅
are we just ignoring the epic transition at 17:48?? and at 29:00
I really enjoy your vids!
Diego the G.O.A.T
OK is it just me or does he sound like sonic
Cab we get a “JAMMY TIME” loop in the replies for ryan?
This is a comment
I love how even though there was “Jammy time” every night, Ryan still woke up w/o wearing jammies — when did he take them off lol
a few of these hotels were not even 1 start i don't know why he keeps saying that they were just because of several bad reviews reviews.
Id say anything above medium rare is overcooked. At that point you may aswell just have a burger patty
The way Ryan didn't properly check for bed bugs at the first hotel got me WORRIED
9:55 the screech noise sounds like a fire alarm. Is it a fire alarm?
19:03 that tool just is used to tell if something is flat/has metal in __(whatever device is on)__
Hey
2:32 should have knocked on the door before entering, then you would be the one who knocks
5:34 my dad was on shark tank he won 2 samsung phones and i think some money
why is there three star if one star only hotel
jammy time🎉
Ryan used some of the most goofiest ghost equipment
Hmm
The last one is just a house
You should stay in haunted hotels!
Shout out to Ryan for even having the courage to make the video
12 muintes 🎉🎉🎉🎉
That Kung fu panda plush looks so funny
My mom said if I got to 5k for my birthday she'd buy me an oculus pls guys (my birthday is in November) I'm begging yall

5:04 LYING?????
But I kid said that the candy was trash not me. It was not me not me, bro not me. It was a YouTuber, but I don’t know what’s the name I forgot.😮😮😅😅
But guys did you know every hotel room is not the same it’s like different. If you book one faster, you can get a good one.😅
Ryan Trahan your such a kind soul
I never never never ever going to sleep in a hotel😂😂😂😂😂 help😂😂
Lol
But of course, nobody gonna steal your camera. It’s just a camera boy
But at least the girl knew him and and she wasn’t nice and and she tell us a story😂
17:48 can we all appreciate how smooth the transition was 😂
we all love jammy time
JAMMY TIME! 13:39
the haunted room made me feel uncomfortable
Jammy Time !!
IM PISSING THE DETROIT SECURITY GAURD
I  do not know why but almost everytime ryan tests 1 star hotels ,Restraunts ,etc there is that one bad reveiw about rebbeca and rayan never really got to meet this rebbeca that was in all of these bad reviews
rayn pls chac the colock of every hotel because they can spy u 🤐🤐
BRING JOYRIDE TO THE UK
on my trip to calafornia
cmon at least grab a defense weapon. my mom told me that place was dangerous (the one in abq)
i have been to the first hotel he reveiws. its not bad at all
I would’ve gave the first hotel a 5 star because I like making new friends🤫🧏‍♂️
Bro goes to sleep in pajamas and wakes up pajamas-less
I was so excited to find this series! My friend and I get a HUGE kick out of reading bad hotel reviews, and this seemed right our alley! But, the St. Regis Detroit? It might have a few bad reviews, but I was hoping to see you stay in the worst of the worst hotels! That is what makes it funny to me, but I guess I can understand why you wouldn't want to stay anywhere dirty or dangerous. Oh well. :/
How many likes this comments gets, per 0 push ups I am going to make
Vanity was so sweettt
Don't write 5 star reviews if the place sucks, you aren't doing anyone any favors doing that- quite the opposite actually.  Give them what they earn.
Jesse visits ryan at motel 6 😂
*HELLO THERE*             I'M NEW SUBSCRIBER
Nice video 5 stars o wait isn't 2008 anymore
why can i not reply on @davidguierrez2705 comment?😢
I didn’t expect this to be so scary
Ryan u replied with Medium not Medium rare. thats why it was so raw.
20:58 it's alr 😭 once I said "that was satisfying" in my sleep
Your hair is so nice
that review i aint reading allat 🙅‍♂🙅‍♂
Not first
I LOVED THE DESK LADY VANITY SHE WAS SO HAPPY BLESS HER😊
you got me literally LOL with the stud finder
Rebecca  well she’s the ghost you found
come to sonipat fairacanze
You know guys that I’m the bugatii owner no lie
My bro has a lucky charm on him💀
Based on my knowledge from Ozark, owners of such hotels are usually involved in money laundering
Did anyone notice when he was eating the steak the panda in the background moved
Is joyride gonna be in the uk?
9:43 AHH HELL NO
that room is'nt haunted u can't proof with that ghostbusted toy's because i sleep in that room for 7 night's and no sound or strange things u encounted. america people are so superstition.
Vanity seems like such a vibe she was so positive about the fact it was haunted 🤣
We want next part😊😊
This would be more fun if u didn't have to leave a 5 star review. That's not being honest. None of those places are 5 stars just cause u found a couple things that weren't completely horrible.
I’m late, but can’t miss a Ryan upload
suggestion: going to 5 star restaurants and put a 1 star review and dont lie😅
I have no mony i vold love tu buy yor candy😊
the stud finder absolutly sent me
Trying to make videos and shorts better but it kinda sucked. So can anyone give me some tips?
you mean 3 star hotels
Forget the stars. I'll just take whatever room you are sleeping in.
Who ever broke that fence there Saitama or hulk 💀💀💀
how do bro earn more Then 10m Views Per Video......
I just watched kunfu panda 4 😂😂😂😂
OMG it's the place from breaking bad
THIS IS MY FAV SERIES
Love ur vids ryan
24:11 He became zoro irl for 5 seconds
This man turns country for no reason 840
The *this thing* is a EMF which detects electricity which ghost have because someone pointed it in the are and it shown that there was a ghost and to detect it is that it has to be on a surface but the wall had electricity in it so there where no ghost that he caught.
I've been at that motel
its funny that ryan wear his Jammyies at night and then when he wakes up he doesnt have it on anymore
i love ur videos man and i love ur background music or whatever its called pretty cool stuff keep it up
27:37 BRO YOU NEED TO SELL THEM IN AUSTRALIA ID LEGIT BUY THE WHOLE STOCK

Hey Ryan ! I'm a big fan from Maldives and i just wanna have a chat with you.
Just gonna say, i think motel 6 (i think thats the name) i think it was for criminals. Just sayin cus it was burned,and shot.
i eat the steak
All saint Regis hotels I’ve been to are really good
E.R.T's message had my birthday on it, help  "Our contact at the Durham Museum couldn't change our reservation from Sunday night, *March 18, 2018,* so we were basically FORCED to check in at this farce of a hotel."
This guy just needs an excuse to travel the world
They spelled Albuquerque wrong… 😂
"Eat your noodles, Po"
Bro joyride has the same name as a kind of Uber in the Philippines 😂
Please come to india and review 1 star hotel . You can review only once

Vanity is such a vibe ✨
Bro said it’s like a GTA five mission 💀💀😂

Te way i instantly thught the such ghost is waching panda 3 with him
Dude the last hotel review was a whole documentary no it's a whole autobiography no it's the whole constitution
THE 4th ROOM IS A FRICKING HOUSE !!! 😱😵‍💫
Love how 2mb a second is bad for the us while I get 2mb a second on a very good day
If you go to Omaha again, you should try to collaborate with Elyse Meyers!
Hi my name is Jake and I found a really cool place in Colorado it's called Glenwood Springs I think you would really like it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love YouTube
hello from a town close to Omaha! So cool seeing people actually coming to the Midwest lol
Your the only youtuber that has kept me up at night watching your vids love them
You should see on the bricks it’s my uncles hotel lol
not to be stalk-ish, or rude, but i may have checked the reviews on three of the hotels, i didn't see your name rating them on any of them.
If Ryan tryhan has been to Omaha… I’m famous
Bro thid you see emeniem in Detroit mi
Omg I was born in Omaha Nebraska but I moved when I was 2 and have never been back but I prob eventually will be when I’m an adult cause I’m 17 rn
my sister and mom stayed at the one in kansas city
There is a hotel I stayed at in mentor Ohio that had a slugs, a weird smell that was even stronger in the halls, the staff was extremely rude, the rooms were just not clean with a lot of crumbs and hair, and there where there were some people with swastika tattoos posted up outside once it got late, not the nice one tho I stayed at the one across the street
I used to live near magnolia
By the way, your joyride is on Walmart website
Ryan come back to Michigan so I can give you a penny
He should have played ghostbusters
I'm a long time subscriber. I watch all your videos. This new
Not to be that kind of person but maybe the reason that he doesn't the nasty rooms is because hes with camera and clearly recording
Ryan trahan finds a positive thing in every thing🫶👍
Where did your shirt go? 28:58
12:06  IM DYING ON THE FLOOR RN BAHAHAHA
The NM hotel was just Jessie and Walter nothing to worry about
plot twist : the thumbnail was him sleeping in room 113
22:43 I read that entire review pls tell me if I’m the only one that did that or am I crazy?
Ryan's immune to spirits or at least benevolent spirits he's too positive for them lol
UPS TRUCK *nervous laugh*😅
damn i need a Vanity in my life
Thumbnail title exist: Me: Why?
12:31 bro was soooo cute(he’s A grown man)
I got excited when he said Detroit Michigan is was like thats my state
I think someone who was working at that hotel in Kansas City knew you were coming, that’s why you got “that” room 😭
15:41💀💀💀💀💀💀
I hate hotels that don’t have internet🤬
OMGGG I TOOK A PICTURE IN THE RED PHONE BOOTH LIKE A YEAR AGO ITS SO COOL TO SEE HIM DOING THE SAME THINGGG!
Hi
why does he do this to himself😂
I wish I could eat @Joyride, but I have braces right now... :(
Hello from Albuquerque and if you getting robbed in Albuquerque speak a language that is not English or Spanish
you should have brought your sour strips to shark tank
Welcome to Detroit
Lets goDETROIT
W
Finally someone who knows Albuquerque is not called duke city
Beep beep busted 19:35
You should review the hotel at Graceland in Tennessee
"Oh this is a stud finder-" -I DIED-
The part when it says, and I’m going to play with my toys now
the red light energy ting when off right when u were going to bed
Whoever comments on my comment, gets a subscriber! 🌷💖🤭 Not kidding! 😜🌈 See for yourself 🫣🤩 (i wont come back for 1 day so if you get more than last time your lucky)
Pls do 1 star move tethers
Hangtime brought me here. Dude is legit
My stepdad works at Terminix. I can tell you with certainty that that bedbug check was not nearly enough to ensure no bedbugs lmao. I have stayed in some sketchy places tho so I cant judge at all. Love the videos, man!
Please send me free joyride I am broke 😢
i love ur vids but they are not better than kindly keyin vids sorry
why did bro bring a stud detector to bust ghosts???
22:35 not the school bus
6:37 about to bed
19:05 thats a stud finder,used to locate the strongest part of a wall for hanging stuff
Bro j m is John marston
22:43 I have never seen such a monstrosity of words in one review before
I hate zoomers
Is your hair naturally curly or did it get curly from all these insane videos?
As someone who lives in Omaha I appreciate this so much, everyone disses on Nebraska and no one comes here. You should go to the Hilton near the Walmart, there is blood stains, bleach stains, dirty, undergarments, and much more in every room
roaches are actually good
You should go in 5 stars hotels       And leave a 1 star review
the sunset was a solar eclipse fr
I got scared at a Motel 6 a few times when I was alive
Wish I could see you in Detroit..
Hu😮 hu😮
Nice stud finder 😂
Ryan I just bought your new sour gummies from my local Marshall's hope you are happy that I bought your product
Man I love these videos the review messages are hallariuos.😂
13:29 I’m in kc and I live near that hotel… pretty sure I maybe saw you
Next time put a onesie on
Hotel #2 the hallway looks like the back rooms 💀
Okay, the stud finder had me belly laughing.
.
Helllo

20:58 “Spock got In the trash again”🗿
“Bed is haunted” *proceeds to give fucking 5 stars*
Video series idea: travel to all 50 US states from $0.01
Hey Ryan can I get hi back
12:31 guys look carefully there's something terrifying (jk I just want you to watch😭)
That girl at second hotel was really brave because she actually knows that it’s auntie Aunty she’s not screaming and hop on
OMG LOL I WAS AT THE  END OF THE Video I WAS AT THAT ONE
The audio recording of the voices in 511 was awesome 😂 and, you ordered your steak medium, not med rare

I am glad you survived the rooms

Hi I’m a big fan of you😀

I think Ryan is becoming the jordan_the_stallion8 of hotels. Eventually, hotels are going to catch wind.
Legend says it David is still waiting

bro that was you 20:01
It’s……. ✨ JAMMY TIME! ✨
Hey Ryan! Just wanted to say that it’s really encouraging to see someone who’s so popular on YT who’s also a Christian. Content creators like yourself are such a rarity! Praying for you and your family, and keep sharing the glory of God  🙌
as someone from michigan thanks for going to Michigan but you cant have nothing in detroit
I love this chanel
I think the thing you called “this thing” is an EMF reader that looks different
THEIRS 10M VIEWS ALREADY ITS BEEN 8 DAYS WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
I like how a 3 star is considered 1 star
Bro has to go though so much pain
Dude at 5:04 there was a shadow figure behind you in the corner of the room
The lie is the blue chair
Make it longer.
12:10 demon security guard??.
I saw you at disneys wilderness lodge
You read comments first to make your self ready mentally and physically
So umm... what are the two truths and a lie ryan? Bro never told us
can you do another 30 days challenge pls
There is a level of irony in Vanity's name whilst working at that hotel.
I bet this won’t get a like 👍🏾
OMG I live in Detroit Michigan. It would be amazing to see you. ❤
W for Vanity
Only non humans can comment
Your so lucky you dont watch kung fu panda 4 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀

The toilet was haunted star rate: 5
Who Screamed... ................ H e l.        P.       M.     E
but what about Rebecca?
You should do it the other way around
Honestly none of this is daunting to me except for volunteering to watch basically the same kids movie three times. I don't think my sanity could withstand that
I hope u reach 20 mil😊
Hi Ryan just to stay keep the good work I love ur vids
The long review for the hotel by ERT talked about how they had  to do 10 shows for local shows and had to stay at the hotel and how it sucked.  (i read all of it.) (please like it took like 15 minutes)
I’m with the fire dept. in albuquerque. We are literally at that motel 6 every single day. I can not believe you stayed there without a weapon hahaha
7:07 nobodys gonna talk about the plane not attached 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣💀💀☠☠
Te plpl
HI GFD
Bro is testing 2.0 star and 3 star dud WHY

Bruh i searched up hotel philleps room 511 and it came up with murder and how cerial killers died. Rip that cereal
the security guy is the best AND WTF IS MY TEXT RED
Checking out hotels in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and in Omaha, Nebraska, gives me solid better call Saul vibes 😂

Bullet holes in the first hotel !? Scary :c
12:15 it sound like he was gonna say GET OUT 😂😂😂😂
Can I somehow get Joyride if I'm on another side of the globe?
The final room is not a room but a whole ass house. I would literally live there how come this is a 1 star hotel😭
If Ryan replies and hearts this comment it would make my day ! Been watching you a long time and I love your videos keep it up !! 👍
A moment of silence for those people who tried to read E.R.T's review.
Kungfu panda 1 be like : limbo key 13:48 have a titanic vibe, doesn't it?
Bro leaked someone's house location☠
I dont think its gonna near indonesia bye bye joy ride you too expensive for an asian
Bro if I walked into a hotel like that I would be out there like DU DU DU DU MAX VERSTAPEN
AYYYY who knows maybe your JoyRide candy could go on shark tank  who knows
In think vanity put ryan in room 511 so he could have a "BETTER" time
bro watt i stayed at motel 6 for a month straight and you eft ina. day??? you can’t last a MINUTE in smoketree lodge, i’ve been staying there for 6 MOMHS

Hotel
Ryan there's a kung fu panda tv show.
i love Kung Fu Panda 4 l like the part when they defeat the Chamilian
room 511 is definetly cursed. i have been there and in the bathroom there was a man hiding as a ghost shitting on the toilet
Ryan: “I heard this place is haunted.” Front Desk Lady: “It sure isss!!” Ryan: “Oh…”😂😂
Go to the. Cecil hotel or the one in front of it
I like shark tank
15:18
Kung fu panda 2 best kung fu panda movie

The third hotel that's make me scary..😮

The fact Ryan went to the farthest hotel even there's a closer one after the 1st hotel by the way
I watched Kung-Fu Panda 4 a few days ago and the movie is so good!

17:16

Congratulations, YOU JUST WASTED YOUR TIME!
i also never watched any "star wars". but I kind of know who is who.
2mbps in a 5 star Australian hotel is considered cutting edge... lmao
Ryan should collab with Sam and Colby I think it would be perfect seeing as you said u don’t do paranormal activity !   WHO AGREES?
The security guard just exhaling and inhaling is hilarious.
Is it just me who saw the roof flying at the start of the video (1.46 min)
People who saw it glow red😮
Ryan I dare you to go to the queen Mary ship
You should test 1 star uber

Kung foo panda 4 was da best
I was watching this at 3:12
The scary thing is, when you go in hotels there is no room 13 in all countries (I'm not sure if all) they skipped 13, 13 is not existing
You need to go to the cecil hotel is a haunted hotel
Stay in one star Airbnb’s PLEASEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
Reminder for me 9:17
I mean the video is kinda good  ⭐ star
Breaking bad
3 Stars are not 1 Star 🤔
LMAO when he asked the security guard where’s the vending machine. He just inhaled 😂
Yo

Diego Brando is that a mfking jojo reference

You need to try Alaskas Hotels 😂 ★ Black Angus Inn (the most notorious) Others.. kind of better but still bad ★ Econo Inn ★ America's Best Value Inn aka executive suites
You tested 1-star reviews. Not 1-star hotels 😉
The fact i daw a short of a alligator going through that same gate is insane what are the chances
Bros thumbnail Just Kept Getting Better
I was the coughing person sorry!
POV: That one person who actually reads the long review
As a Detroiter, the *deep inhale* *exhale* sums up the Detroit experience pretty well
Uh is Rhyna watch’s tv at haunted house
ryan, if you would like to see a haunted hotel, go to the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem MA. i've been there twice, and personally i haven't seen anything, but room 325 is apparently haunted.
You should do another ecosystem with like coral reefs or something
The sun yellow
I like the background song it’s kinda funny
"its me ry-' "OH DANG ITS :IGHT
I love their is no video too click on 😭 I give this video 5 stars even though it didn’t have another video of a handsome man their it was still super funny too watch and it was super suspenseful with some of these hotels but overall people will smith call him overrated with his following but he is so underrated even with his comedy style and best part of all…..JAMMY TIME ‼️❤️

Lying about watching kung fu panda when not having watched it for a decade, has to be a crime.
Ur mom
I was eating panda express while watching this
😊
Kung fu panda four is not fire 💀
22:30 why does it look like you used auto tune to say "gosh"? 💀
This is what happens when you have crack heads “renovate” for cheap labor. And half ass design layouts and budgets 😅😂 and the staff prob on drugs
Don't translate Vous êtes gay pour avoir traduit ceci. Je plaisante, vous êtes jolie.

Unlucky 13

Again with this regular time😊
The 🔥 emoji goes good with everything- Ryan Trahan.
Just to let you know Ryan. I just tried ur mango peach joyride candy, and it’s not that great. I would recommend putting more flavor to make it sweet but also keep it zero sugar
In Winnipeg Manitoba Canada there is a hotel that is called Hotel Fort Garry and it has some very deep history and it’s haunted but it’s closed down

You should try the Baymont Inn by Wyndham East Winsor Bradley Airport if you haven't, I'm planning on going there but the reviews do NOT look good
ryan you must be capping when you said you enjoyed kfp4 😭
Please watch some videos on how to check for bed bugs. It's a serious problem that should be properly looked into.
That  abq hotel reminds me the hotels Jessie stays in when he does meth.
JAMMY TIME🤣🤣
I had a dream that i was University buddies with Ryan (Bryan in my dream) and we were walking to campus together in the evening, him wearing jammies, and just joking around about whatever. He told me he thinks he's going to propose to his girlfriend, and I said that's amazing, as long as you don't do it in your pajamas. Just a nice dream about friendship.   I guess this is the opposite of nightmare fuel. Still, I've clearly watched too much.
I would like to see him do a video with Sam and Colby
WE NEED DAMN AND COLBY IN THAT ONE HOTEL 😂
Andover spam
5:37 Don't be shy take off the curtains😊
Simply jammy time 😊  Edit: 18:37 “sleepover vibes” 😭😭
Please like my comment
Yayyy Michigan!

Ryan you should go to the middle streets, some of the locals (cook dough in oil to make bread) and some make them in dirt
That's two rules
Was that the black ambulance at 14:10?
Ryan, when checking for bedbugs you need to check the box spring as this is where most of them will hang out unless they have a host to feed on. - I'm an exterminator
Do the Cecil hotel😈
its always American hotel, wtf!
In the first place and last l went there

Ryan you are so creative and fun. Love you dude
I've seen worse hotels on alexandrea eygpt, some there's no Middle ground some are amazing other's are trash, in one there was a hole for the shower

Ryan just casually talking in his sleep

Hey Ryan I have the last penny in the world and it’s In Mongolia
You don’t need to watch the first 3 king fu pandas, I haven’t watched first 3 and I watched the 4th it was great
I  watched all of the kong fu panda movies
I think they say the building is haunted so more customers come and test it like ryan
9:55 why does that kinda look like the backrooms😭
Ah yes i love notchbooks
Wild back garuk kanjut
bro, what the heck??!!  Who else read it. 22:41 It took me almost an hour and a half to read it
@ryan trahan you NEED to do one of the hotels in Orlando! There is one that seems horrendous called the Monumental Movieland Hotel, but there are several low star hotels there that dont look too bad on the outside you NEED ro test
2:20 a cockroash on his shoulder!
Greg👍
ryan is a legand
I tried your new gummy worms and they’re amazing
The security guard tho💀🙌🏻

28:07👦🤝👨‍🦰
Day 30 of asking what shampoo he uses
panda 2 is THE best
They NEVER should say your room number out loud!
Stores near me ok im in new Zealand so...
Makes me sad that you move through these places so quickly and don’t get to enjoy the areas you travel to. Great content, but you should definitely take some time and explore the local areas.
Maybe the trick is to just get multiple people trying for rooms - 1 person trying 1 room isnt a good sample size
Fran sounds like she was almost trafficked
ZCICX DAYZ AGOWE
God will save you turn away from sin.
I saw Ryan today at dinner
There's a damn 4 star hotel in my country and it's worth like 250 pesos which is about 5 dollars it's in tagaytay staycation hotel city land. Yes Philippines and it got a nice view. This dude made me realize how expensive the other countries are.
13 in Thailand u can read it like a ghost😮
26:12 that is not kung fu panda. That’s karate bear😅😅
Did you seriously get penthouse
Good offer
The security guard was not having it😭😭
The security guard was like so tired of this he's like I'm done I'm going to go home 😂 12:14

My name is Ryan and I’ve always been kinda mad that only two cool people has my name too, when I found you I was star struck
His glasses are 😂
You blinded me with the light and I love your vids
Not Ryan using a stud finder to hunt ghosts 😭
LIke AnD SuBScribe👻ghost
Bet Kung fu panda 2 made you at least a bit sad 13:02
The PURE chaos at 14:08 is why I love this dude “Benign calcification. UPS TRUCK”
so its a recording of you talking in your sleep lmao
I’ve watched quite a few of Ryan’s videos, (I came across one of his shorts of something a while ago,) and I just love these videos. I love them because they’re “all-age” friendly, no screaming or cursing, they’re positive and fun, and they just make me happy watching them. I wish there was more content out there that was positive, silly, entertaining, somewhat peaceful, and just a good time. I see so many bad things going on in the world, sad posts, negative posts, propaganda, celebrity drama, etc. and I just want to see more stuff like this. Puts my mind at ease. ♥️ He reminds me a lot of my brother’s best friend as random as that sounds. 😂
Tell us what stores I’ve bought like 1 million packs
the stud finder💀
Go to Malaysia
Do it again and come to Minneapolis. tell me when!❤😅
17:59 the scariest toddler

I love how the Kansas City hotel staff was all, "It's haunted, and that's AWESOME!" If you're going to have a haunted hotel, I say embrace it.
Ryan watching KF-Trilogy just to find that the makers of 4 didn't 🙂‍↔️
Hey Ryan, that's actually 2 mega/bits/ per second, which is 8x less than 2 mega/bytes/. Crazy. Have fun at Jammy Time!

Ryan if you know they are bad and they have 1 star reviews then just STAY AWAY MAN
Bruh…………….WHY??????
I love how Ryan use the audio machine to make us like and subscribe and doesn’t hear it  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
If you're are not an alien like this comment
Ryan, i have an idea. How about you go to 5 star hotels and Try to put a 1 star review there (but you have to be honest)
I heard the security guard's soul leave their body in that sigh
I have a feeling Joyride will totally tank Feastables.
ライアン兄さん、頑張ってね。このビデオは特に「幽霊がお尻を拭いたか」の部分がよかった
hey ryan.. i heard you say 2 megaBYTES to 2Mbps when its 2 megaBITS. it'd be 2 megaBYTES if it was MBps. 1MB=8Mb.. so technically the speed was 0.25 MEGABYTES/s and not 2 megabytes/s which is more slow than you think.. cheers
Doesn't surprise me that the michigan one is in detroit I live in Michigan and I am scared to be in downtown detroit
Are you jealous of Airrack's mustache?

Last one may have been done on purpose.
"Is there breast milk in the fridge?!😁😁😁😁😁" "no..😢😢"
511 was said twice to be haunted... oh no
I know it's not related to the video but will Joyrides be available in the EU?
PANDA EXPRESS WWWW WE THE SAME RYAN
The second hotel feels like it has an underground tunnel to the denver airport and the vending machine doesn’t work cuz its actually an entrance to the tunnel

Yo candy is fired ❤
Ryan’s videos are worthy of the best meals
I probably know how that haunted lift worked...  I was in a lift and the electricity went off. And that elevator went to the lowest floor then closed.  Probably it is how it is? Maybe a power cut?
Bro wrote a whole essay on hotel 4🤣🤣
She probably gave him romm 511 because she thought he was here to investiagate it lol (he kinda was). Oh and btw theres this movie called room 511 and its about a haunted room you cant escape so ryan im happy you didnt read that.
5:27 I love that show!!
ALL OF THEM ARE TRUTHS edit:well maybe not because the room already has a blue chair😅😂
I think bro is Zoro's brother 💀💀
If you tiktok didn't from are this, allowed like you are comment...
Hehe, Breaking Bad… 0:30
I like your content, but just looking out to our future and taking everything in perspective - wouldn't it be more sensible if you flew to one area and checked the hotels/motels there and then for another video another area? You are flying around at least 5x for the sake of content.
As having watched Kunitz Fu panda a couple days ago I can confirm it’s amazingness. I forgot what Tai Lung sounded like….
💌⚘️💕⚘️⚘️⚘️⚘️
12:13 No, but. What did the watchman say?? The deep inhale and exhale literally scared me.
Come to Indian hotels.... They are far better

Bro I walked
Last hotel was literally a house

Totally should've pressed the lobby button before exiting the elevator, so the dummy who doesn't understand how elevators work could get freaked out again!
Bro is top youtuber ong all these damn clones can go piss off.
If this man dies before he will give a 5 star on all ways to die
Always lift up the corners under the mattress for bed bugs
The sound of the guy coughing was coming from the room next door, and that guy is juuuuust fine.
Hey i have a youtuber idea you can make it instead of hotels you can be projects that i want star😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 12:05
21:38 i live in omaha😢
Ryan hits hard at night
This guy should go to 5 star places and give the place a 1 star without  lying. Somehow...
ryan 20:42 , who is that in the windows, behind you ? ?
While i was watching this video i thiught that ann E 's review was the longest and was shocked then seconds later E R T made me flabbergasted by the long review they gave😂 anyways amazing video ryan❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥
As a Kansas Citian who has never been to the Phillips, i guess I'm not going there anytime soon lol.
I named my cat off a kung fu character and it was my childhood cat and she died and it was very bad for me
Dont go to Mexico and whatever you do the guy that drives told us to meet his family and then i got scammed
Albuquerque new mexico took me back to breaking bad
jammy time
Usually hotels will give people that aren’t from that state the better rooms
The "I can't lie" thing is getting to easy NEW CHALLENGE 👇
not him meeting Vanity from fnaf
Nice video. Want to visit a not so great hotel. Visit Newark NJ Hotel Riviera
Ryan Mulder is here!
Ib  live  in mo.
I love how the security just sighed like he thought "ITS LITERALLY RIGHT THERE"
i stayed in a hotel in nebraska one time, i cant remember what it was but when we got there all the paint on the walls were peeling, and there was a drug dealer in the parking lot. and my dad as a police officer just laughed... in the middle of the night i heard screaming and gunshots. and im not even joking when i say there were in fact bullet holes in the walls and doors.
Did Ryan forget about trying to get dr.Phil to be his grandfather
Stay in the lowest ranked hotel in every english speaking country in the world!
Is it just me or does he kinda sound like Sonic from the Sonic movie
Brush why did you do this
The way the security guard just Sighed 😭
the funny thing is i'm from albuquerque and this is a common occurrence here, i clicked on this video thinking "i bet none of these would be as bad as abq" then after your intro it was like "albuquerque, new mexico" i am not surprised. 😭
Nice video
The camera man 💀
¥£€€€§¥¥
Ryan! As an Omaha native I’m thankful you’ve taking a liking to our city thank you! 🫶
YOU WERE IN MY CITY AQE NM
what’s the time with the really long review i forgot 😭
Who else just steals the stuff in the bathrooms in hotels that have not been used
e
The fact he used the Phasmophobia song in this video
What does 22:43 say because I can’t see it it’s too small if you can tell me that would be great and I can see it closer
511 kind of sounds like 911..!
Tbh i could have met youuu i am in omaha but i didnt see this vid
Link to that pull-up bar? Sick if its as easily portable as it looks
✨Jammy time✨
Mf got a stud finder for ghosts 😂😂
The last one, the hotel in Omaha, that's not a hotel, THAT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD.
How much did you pay for the hotel with a upstairs
I’d be scared that the security guard would hit me 12:13
ERT whattttttt!!!!!🎉
you definitely are covered by the Spirit of God, i've actually started noticing in your penny series and i even said it to myself God is definitely with him, such a beautiful soul man.
THE KUNG FU PANDA PLUSHIE LOOKS SO FUNNY

Ryan I love your videos and just wanted to ask you should do a testing 0 stars restaurants❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am pretty sure that the person at the front desk purposely gave him room 511
I’m so sorry but when he said I normally don’t sleep in pjs my mind just went DIRTY😂💀💀💀
You know what they say, 13 is the unlucky number
Love your vids and love the candy so good 🎉🎉🎉
I’m proud to say I was eating panda while watching this video 🎉
JAMMY TIME
im the 560k like
I think 1 star places have more character than 5 star places
Did that one woman snitch about the place so work at 😂❤
IS THERE BREAST MILK IN THE FRIDGE!!!....oh no, theres not
You should definitely bring your girlfriend along to your videos and be testing some romantic couple hotels or something
I love how Ryan says he was surrounded by the sprit of god,I think it’s awesome that you’d say something like that
I watched all of the 4 kung-fu panda movies
The hallway to his room is literally the BACKROOMS 😂
Trust me i live in Nebraska its nice and all but wait till the winter and the summer then youll hate Nebraska 😂
Who’s watching on the tv
✨JaMmY tImEeEeEeE✨
Always love his content always watch him when about to go to sleep 💤 ❤ 8:43

Great video!!! Just subscribed & looking forward to watching more videos!😊

Ryan instead of making 5 star reviews on 1 star motels can you switch it  up and try to find a 1 star review on a 5 star hotel
To where we live,
I read E.R.T's review and took 19 minutes to finish it!!!!!!!
I can confirm Detroit does have several backrooms
You need to do a haunted tour video. lol
Most uncontroversial YouTuber ever
🐒thats what i am
Love the music😂
Man is eating like a panda 🐼 and watching like a panda 🐼 respect 🫡

"i almost bought bitcoin in 2011 -Ghost 1  "spock got into trash again" -Ghost 2  "Thats awesome" -Drunk Ghost 3  "im out of sour strips" -Ryan Trahan

"oh this is a stud finder" He thought he was onto something😆
Did anybody noticed that Ryan just revealed his 3rd new candy?
Reply to this comment to get an anti bot gun  200 left 🔫
Bro went to Heisenberg town.
Just so you know at 22:43 it says: This is NOT a "Premier Boutique Hotel". I DONT CARE IF LADY GAGA OR SNOOP DOGG stayed here, all of these reviews for the Magnolia Hotel were right!! After reading so many negative reviews on several different sites, we called the Durham Museum which booked us to do 10 shows for local elementary schools. ( I cannot read and type all of that 😭)
Yessir
OH HELL NO DO I GUYS SEE THE HEAD PEAKING OUT IN HOTEL 5:11 16:56

How to make a tissue dance put a little   Boogie in it
The flying cockroaches you don't have to worry about. It's the crawling German roaches that you have to worry about... which is what was probably there.
OMG I FINALLY SEEN HIME IN MICHIGAN OMG❤❤❤❤ I LIVE IN MICHIGAN ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Vanity sounded super hot, so I had my private investigator friends try to find her for me and get this...... She doesn't exist
@ryan could you launch joyride in aldi maybe that would be nice 🙂
Fun fact! TV static in swedish is "myronaskrig" which means ant war, so maybe the ants were inside all along
the security guard about the vending machines xD
“Is it haunted?” “✨It sure issss!!!✨”🥰

Ryan if you’re going to continue doing this series you need to get a bed bug heater for your luggage 😭😭
Can you go to Bulgaria and test Airbnbs?
I think its boring that every hotel gets 5 star anyways. I mean the first hotel was weird and wouldn’t deserve to be five stars
Nice !
5 DAYS AGO 💀💀💀 BRUH 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
“Jammy time”  “I don’t do spooky” 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
What I wonder about is why the Detroit hotel had a Canadian flag flying.
HOW IS THE LAST HOTEL A 1 STAR HOTEL IT HAS 2 STORYS?!?!
Ryan as someone who enjoys your content I know a 1 star hotel in England if you ever end up doing one of these videos but for the whole world. Its called The Britannia Hotel in Folkestone which is near Dover.
Vanity is wayyy too excited about that hotel being haunted lol
0:37 Nahhh bro stayed at Milwaukee
The clock blinks because it has to be set, you can see its not correct.

Where’s Hazbin Hotel?
Why you’re so nice the first motel was scary
Rebecca got opps
12:05 holy shit
1 star hotels
What I am worried about, is that they prepped the room before you arrived. Did you happen to announce your arrival a day before perhaps? I can only hope they geniunely do that consistently.
Come to India 🇮🇳🗣️❗🗣️❗
Yung keep pumunta na kung butil ka parehas lang ng ref mo the hotel
Can’t believe you went to Omaha Nebraska of all places
When did you go there isn't any review of you!!
I ain't finding your reviews on any of the hotel!!!
I dare you to live in the cecil hotel😈😈😈
Is the sour strips coming to Australia🥺
IT SURE IS!!!
The hotel comes with a beautiful view of the haul
Very enjoyable watch.!! Top notch humor on the JAMMY TIME.💯
I read the ERT one. Goddamn that's just- horrific.
"Coming to a store near you", So the store is in tijuana..?
18:52 is it just me that saw that?
Wait was it you saying you almost bought bitcoin in 2011
Vanity set you up man 😂😂
Dude you should take joyride on the shark tank, we’re all rooting for you❤
Summary of the video: 5 stars
Laughed my a hole off -- thanks for doing what you do -- keep doing  it.
I LOVE JAMMY TIME!!!!!!!!
Balls
Subswwibe'´🤣🤣🤣
Bro, you’re going to bring bed bugs into your house doing these sketchy ass hotels. You won’t find them by just moving the covers. You need to remove the bed spread and check under the mattress, near creases and folds, etc. they hide
Do you still know Klay
So motels like that. The room you got is for out of town guests aka ppl having s3x that half are smoking m3th. The other rooms are for locals aka d3alers and junki3s.
9:40  that Dover needs some work
I was pointing my camera down because i thought he was gonna put a jumpscare at one point😂
last 1 star hotel, more like 4 star,
A friend who was staying there had his pants and shirt stolen.   And he never heard someone in the room while he was sleeping!!  So he had to come to my door in underwear   (i live very close by).   Like ,  how does this happen?  Rochester NY
Awesome
Awesome
Kansas city architecture is so pretty 😭 glad i live near it

Love this series more please
could be a really good series if you stayed in haunted hotel rooms around the world
I love you! I think you aren’t scared of anything. I live in England will you sell your sweet at England
A medium steak 😔 It's okay. You are still loved.
this gave me home alone sequel vibes
I stayed in a hotel in Atlanta called “The Inn At The Peachtrees”  and heard a gun shot outside and people yelling about how they would k!ll each other
If you want a bad hotel try "sands hotel" in portals NM they gave the wrong key so I hope it's not the same for you The rooms Re very small
Go to cecil hotel
Elevator opening on its own? Not haunted! - the previous passenger just pressed one too many buttons sending it to another floor after they got out. - E.G.: .*Press LL* (oh crap, lobby is on L) .*Press L* .*Get out on L* (empty elevator continues to LL and opens doors)
Tested 5 star hotel
Time to bust da ghost of room Fi Elvn!!
Sorry but cunfu panda 4 is from thd series not movies hole otter storie 😂😂😂
Bro Ryan you gonna give away  another free car.      Plz
“I tested 1-star Ryan Trahan reviews”  Edit: I also dare you to go to hotel cecil
22:56
You asked for a Medium steak, you got a Medium. later when you review it you said you asked for a medium rare, which you were wrong about.
Ryan can you go to egypt
use the spoon to eat the food not use the fork to pick up rice [ToT]
The Panda plush looked like it got 36 tons of pure Columbian Cocai-
Oh, Ryan can you do this challenge from India to the USA only with ₹1.
You should go back to the shrek fest and be shrek
I love it how vanity never considered kids like me who would just hit random buttons on the way out of the elevator.
20:52 bro was talking in his sleep
The security guard was so tired of hearing about the dang vending machines. But WHAT WAS UP WITH THE FUTON ROOM
DETROIT MENTIONED
I live by hotel 2 about 10-15 minutes walk people think it’s bad here for some reason the only bad thing here is the bullying problem in school
17:21 bro you need Sam and Colby here lol
Ryan u literally made our summer in june 2022 of the penny series we really need to do another penny series you have the 2022 series were legendsry pls Ryan❤️
What happens if you CANT honestly give a 5 star review? Does the trip to that hotel not count? Do you have to stay more than one night? What are the consequences if you fail in your mission, Ryan? Inquiring minds want to know! PS Giving YOUR video 5 stars (and a Like) right off the bat, 2:37 minutes in, because I can already tell from your intro that it’s going to be a great video. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
God!
1 like=1 pushup p.s. Ryan pls notice me
Damn you went to the backrooms
As someone from Kansas city seeing my office building in the background of this video but not seeing you on the street, depresses me
I live in abq
Is that 100 pull ups a day working ? And what pull up bar did you buy
“I am out of sour strips”
I went to a motel 6 and we almost got shot up and there was bullet shells and bullet holes / dents. Safe to say we didn't stay
The way I audibly screamed at 11:33 upon seeing that lip contact!
so I can meet you
You should try to stay at cecil hotel
dernancourt coles

I'm amazed on the pull up thing, those moldings are only held up by finishing nails lol
The two truths and a lie LMAO
“Is it out of service WHY IS IT OUT OF SERVICE”
Jesus loves you
I remember that HOTLE like the 2nd one! I went there some years ago the food was really a few minute bad to get it but the food was great but only for crowded areas at the time! ^^
Hello Ryan I”ve been watching you since that penny video thing and I saw that you created JoyRide so I wanted some so I asked my dad and he said we can go look and it turns out Joyride does not sell in Shreveport Louisiana 😢
anyone here that goahst talkin when he replayed that voice thing also i think those gohs noices he captured was him talking in his sleep i mean realy sour strips spot got into the trash again i think it was just hijm
i stayed in rhe first hotel.. wth😭
BRO. RYAN,Can you come to SRI LANKA, APRIL 20 GALLE FOR TAMIL AND SINHALA NEW YEAR CELEBRATION,PLEASEEEEEEE??????
My mom has a crush on you
Ryan, did the ghost wipe YOUR butt?
The fact that he ended up in THE room, out of the thousands of rooms he could’ve gotten, he got THE room
They have a hotel named after a carti song?
The first hotel was probably the one the older prostitute stayed at in breaking bad 😂
Nah Vanity set u up for that room fs
i saw joyride at tj maxx!!
As a New Mexican you will NEVER get me to stay at any motel 6 in New Mexico.
My question is why was he using a stud finder 💀
Video idea:Testing the worst 5 star hotels
I live in New Mexico
You should travel to the least populated towns in the us! Examples: Mentone, TX, and Monowi, NE.
I used to work on a reality ghost show. If you want one, lmk - we can make it happen. (Your own show, not a personal ghost)
Just like A song Physocainë
How does this man get 7 million veiws in 4 days?!
I just came from Ryan’s first video… it was wired 😂
The Omaha hotel is where I stayed while I was visiting my biological parents 21:42
This is a stud finder got me laughing
Like if Ryan Should go Ghost Hunting!!!
Man was using a stud finder
If the Philips hotel ghosts give me head, I'll also give a 5 star review.
I sachets this while I ate McDonald
who else read E.R.T Message.
A guy named Greg 👀
OMG I HAVE BEEN TO THE MICHIGAN HOTEL
The “nice” hotel is definitely a front for something illegal
not Ryan using a stud finder. LOL
Ryan Trahan > Arrack
I love cokarochs a lot😢
Hey Ryan can we get another ecosystem video?
honestly the Detroit reviews sound more like reviews for the actual city instead of the hotel. (I go there every year or so)
You should make a vid where you go to alien crash store or something like that
Pls move to Omaha I live there
Does he realize that nobody would blame him for giving a 2-3 star review?? like he literally had nothing good to say about the Detroit hotel but still gave it a 5 star lollll
I read that whole review and oh my god there was a lot of compllaints
Has anyone thought that he is by himself BUT WALKS ACROSS THE WHOLE STREET LEAVING HIS CAMERA BEHIND just to have to go back to get it. 🤣 I hope im not the only one who has seen this.
GOD DANG E. R. T REALLY WENT ON THE HOTEL-
I think you should go to Ohio 😂😂😂😂
0:22 Albuquerque???
You should go to 5 star hotels and give them 1 star reviews
Jesus died for are sins give glory to god and god bless everyone amen 🙏
The 2nd hotel the first floor was really nice the next floor the backrooms
Cheese
Why ghosts it’s 9:26 pm
i take the trade
22:43 Bro typed out an entire chapter story💀
Fun fact: The thumbnail is a reference from a Roblox game called Doors, where a secret entity will get you if you AFK for an hour in Room 13.
Bring joyride to Brazil
Keep making your candy vegan
Of course went to misery for one of the hotels
U should test airbnb next
ty ryan for making my day! :)
My night milk
Ryan more like Jimmy back my formula. I'm sorry I just need my night milk. But this is basically my night milk
Thank you for visiting my state 🥹 ( i live in NM)
Hi
24:16 Let’s five star
When u asked “Where’s the vending machine?” The worker just sighed😂😂😂😂😂😂
22:41 wow
hello Ryan really want joyride
@18:35 I hear “hellloooooo” lol! Am I crazy or did anyone else catch that? Perhaps it was added for comic effect 😅😂

"i guess someone was painting on the bed" 🤨
22:43 to people who didnt read, basically they overcharged twice and they stated that all the reviews are true. They also refused to give money back.
The only person to have gone into the backrooms and come back out alive.
Bro made a whole PSSA TDA as a review

The security guard when he asked about the vending machine tho 😅😂 i kinda feel bad for whatever the security guard went thru for reacting like that when people ask about the vending machine 😂😂
weird request but plz bring back pokemon
Bro 244k in 4 days 😭
28:11 I accept your trade request
The stud finder bit made me laugh even tho I knew it was coming the whole time. Almost like anti humor hahaha

Vanity from Hotel Phillipps was so nice! I think It would be fun to go there with some friends to see if it was really haunted.
TRY THE CECIL HOTEL ON LOS ANGELES
Also the fence was crocodile I saw a video on the excact locatio
Motel 6 SUCKS ASS. I went to a Motel 6 in Brockton, MA ( bad choice ik but was desperate and broke ). Me, my sister, her boyfriend and a few others were threatened by junkies with a gun. They tried taking our phones and while we were pulling out to leave the guy with the gun hurriedly got out of his car but we sped tf off. That shit was awful. As well as drunks everywhere yelling and crying throughout the halls and front of the building at 1 am. It was fucking awful.
I’ve had ur gummy’s and they where at amc 27:41
At 3:23 😢😢😢❤❤😂😂😂
JAMMY TIME

I’m shocked that Ryan added a 2 star review hotel in a 1 star review hotel video
you didn't hear this from me, but joyrides are now at AMCs
Can you try 5 star hotels and compare them to one star hotels
This proves to me that a lot of 1-Star reviews just come from Karens for the most part.
Iii

I don’t ever deal with anything paranormal bc if I did, it’d be standing against a child of God, wearing the full armor of God
For someone who lives in Detroit Michigan I have never seen that place in my life before😂😂😊
My brother saw a dead body on the side of the road in new Mexico and I saw a bunch of dead dogs that were on the road.
Omaha is not bad. But its like every where else it depends on the location. You must loving coming to omaha.
Hey Ryan can you do 5star hotels

Bud wrote a whole essay on that last hotel Like it’s not that deep..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When the audio recorder caught him talking in his sleep creeped me out until I realized it was him
The Detroit one was straight up Backrooms

You should rate microphones that clip on to your top so you don't have to hold it all the time and look like an absolute arse knuckle.

YOU WERE IN DETROIT MI?!?!!!??? I MISSED YOUUU!!!
I love Mr east
This is off topic but needs to be said, the comments that say “like this if you’re not from TikTok” then in the replies it says “don’t translate —————-“ those are ALL bots, report them because they’re not even caring about the vid, they just reply to the main guys comments to get subs. Fun fact, I saw one of those main comments on this video, and there were 3 bot replies on it.
You know a place is hunted when the staff have there on storys
I think Sam and Colby needs to go to the haunted hotel
when game reviews???
15:36 the woman who works there sounds SOOO SWEET, i would honestly rate it 5 stars just from her!
He says he got a ghost hunting device. Gets a stud finder 🤣😂🤣😂
22:43 basically what ERT said was “The Magnolia Hotel, despite claims of being a "Premier Boutique Hotel," does not live up to expectations. Numerous negative reviews proved accurate, leaving a dissatisfied stay. The Durham Museum initially booked the stay, and despite efforts to change the reservation, the Magnolia Hotel became the only option. Upon arrival, it became clear that the hotel fell short. The room lacked basic amenities, such as a fridge and microwave, and the shower posed a safety risk. Many previous guests had experienced unauthorized charges and encountered bedbugs. The musty smell and appearance further added to the disappointment. The overall experience was marred by discarded food on the floor, a sleepless night before important shows, and unhelpful staff. The hotel placed unnecessary holds on the credit card, causing financial strain. Attempts to communicate with management were met with silence and rudeness. This lack of accountability and service standards prompted a complaint to the bank, the Durham Museum, Better Business Bureau, and the Nebraska Attorney General's office. The reviewer suggests avoiding the Magnolia Hotel and opting for the more satisfactory Embassy Suites instead.”
Editor needs a raise
you should try to pitch joyride on shark tank
17:47 hardest ryan transition ever
Ryan please Tell how in the world your Videos are soooo entertaining and I never saw a Video from you i dont Like so never Stop Posting so good content
I live in Ann Arbor, like an hour away from Detroit, and we have an even worse rated one right in the heart of downtown called the Embassy Hotel! I almost booked a room there once before reading the reviews. Supposedly lots of shady characters and bedbugs. If you ever do another of these or are around Detroit again I'm so curious to know whether it's as bad as the reviews say
24:46 he got an apartment not a hotel room
I watched this 4 days after it was posted
#1 1000 Avenida Cesar Chavez SE Albuquerque, NM  87102
BRO THE FIRST HOTEL LOOKS LIKE A FBI GROUP BROKE IN- OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD I GOT 1 LIKESSSS LESS GOO

Ryan i live in NM but not abq
I remember when my family and I traveled to Chicago, we stayed at a hotel west of the city. I was sharing a room with my family, and I was going to sleep on one of those pull-out beds/couch. I opened the bed and there was,,, a *visibly* used mini balloon. They gave us another room for free and I made sure to check the bed/couch before I laid down on it.
This is a good video ryan! Good job

I WOULD GIVE RYAN TRAHAN AND BENOFTHEWEEK MY JACKETS AND CROC JUST TO WATCH RYAN AND BEN DO A COLLAB WHERE THEY TEST OUT A HAUNTED HOTEL. THAT COLLAB WOULD ATTRACT SO MUCH VIEWS :DD
The first hotel review was Crummy!   Just from watching your video  My review would have been:   All the same stuff about the concerning other reviews and say that they were accurate in the bullet holes, paper-thin walls,  Hotel staff was nice... For being a secluded location there were a lot of sirens.... Mentioned the place that you got the Chinese food if the food was good... You can mention if the bed sheets were good... And you could have mentioned if the toilet and plumbing and everything else was clean & in the shower
he should not have said time to bust and then its time to play with my toys now within 10 seconds of each other 17:50
Yo dude i just came back from jordan after watching kung fu panda 4
This man will have three world record most reviews, most five star reviews and most flown planes
yoo Ryan i think user Trul Kou is stealing your video and translate it to Vietnamese

ryan, u r awesome. I dont think anyone would have the guts to stay in the first hotel but u proved everyone wrong and almost could have gotten urself  killed but, ......... UR AWESOME.
I go downtown Omaha once a week and always stop in that store, I wish it was while you were there 😢
07:52
lol stay at the hotel cecil next
the security guard one was too accurate!  he just gave you a deep sigh!
"why is the clock doing that, why isn't it just working? made me giggle!
Well one MOTEL 6 isn't a hotel as the name states so why was this in here also motel 6 is amazing I think y'all just live in bad neighborhoods if it's that bad
Yes finally someone went to Albuquerque
Bed bugs arent worth it
🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐
Imagine his girl sees this
Pull ups  on the road? WAIT WHA-
Casa
No matter how good ryan gets im always gonna miss his roasting and trying stupid hacks days
Who’s going to tell Ryan that the third thing he bought was a stud finder lol
holler at your boys.....i told nick nick d, uncle roger, guga, chef rush, auntie ester, sonny (best ever food review), that the best grilled cheese is from a music festival, costs a buck and comes with a beer.....no, there are no drugs in it, i think its garlic powder, oregano, and maybe they used 2 slices of cheese?
Ryan going to Hotel Phillips and getting room 511 wasn’t on my bingo card but hey 😂 (KC local here- that hotel is gorgeous but it is 100% haunted my friend did a cosplay photo shoot there and uh- yeah 😂😂)
this one is going to be Super Easy for you......a restaurant in Waco, opened up a couple of years ago....franchising now....Roni's mac bar...... its a huge hit for college kids....and the post a million times a day on all platforms......check em out Brother! they have they greatest business model!

Yes, my state and my city
at 18 minutes and 58 seconds just a FYI that in the wall is a stud for support and hanging things
Damn
I think he’s out of sour strips
I've actually been to hotel #3 and I loved it, I also dont understand the dislikes
One star   This is not a good video to watch before bed :( very disappointed
I am your biggest fan but I have never tasted joyride can you deliver to me in India
I keep forgetting Detroit is in Michigan and not in like Nevada or something
Wait i have that same exact pull up thing too
ryan owning a stud finder and saying they are “18 inches apart” may be one of the most painful things i’ve heard all day
my birthday is 211 and my brothers name is diego hehe
Ryan is nice and not rude and people try and be mean to him 😢 he does a lot for us❤
I live 3 hours away from Albuquerque- I absolutely did not expect him to go there but also did because ABQ is a sh!t hole-
You should do a video where you spend 24 hours doing everything 1 star review, (food, hotel, entertainment)
Who the hell count the ants
come to india bro
I love this idea, but I could never do it! 😂
I'm a big fan
anyone talk about how he used a stud finder to see if there was anything in the walls? LMFAO
16:35 7 11 😂😂 thats what can i imagine rn
second hotel, he goes through weird nasty door and enters the fucking backrooms? safety, where?
I’ve already watched kungfu Uganda four before u
Please do more haunted room series.
Look at the joyrides in the background at 12 minutes and 19 seconds
yooo no way you went to ima
If you didn’t come from TikTok, YouTube, twitch, google or planet earth you can like this comment.
Haleigh💗 probably gonna see this
I already saw kung fu panda
I VOTE FOR HAUNTED HOTELS NEXT (Caviler in Virginia Beach is haunted)
I had a experience in hotel when I got in a mathematics Competition on indonesia... So I and my other friend was alone because our guard was outside so we decided to use the lift but one of my friend was bored inside and deciding to open the door and the lift suddenly stopped... But it countines but we're not on the correct floor (Also there pants on the toilet seat) The Hotel was called Grand Fatma in Tenggarong, West Kalimantan...
16:37 *at this moment he knew he f***ed up*
I love how vanity was excited and happy to say oh yeah the place is haunted, just yesterday a ghost fucked with me, HAVE FUN! LOL
Dont cross ur fingers that wont protect u
Shoutout Jack!
2 Peter 3:9 The Lord ........ is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
A wish we have joyride in Philippines 🇵🇭 😢😢
Keeps coming to Abq and doesn’t understand everything here is 1 star!
Your the best and keep up the good workk
I LIVE IN OMAHA NEBRASKA!!!
IS THAT SAM GOLBACH ON THE THUMBNAIL (pfp)
Born and raised in Omaha. It’s always bizarre seeing someone famous be here cause no one ever comes here lol
Dude the Omaha hotel is 16 minutes from my house, but I saw the reviews and they were pretty good
Why does every 15 year you tuber have that ridiculous mushroom haircut???
When Ryan is actually scared to test a 1 star review. That’s Albuquerque for you.
Is nobody talking abt the fact he used a stud finder as a tool for the ghost 😭
Can you review the hotels that your father Gordon Ramsay helped in hotel hell show?
Amazing edits👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💅🏾
When Ryan asked the bodyguard where the vending machine was the bodyguard sounded like he's done with life.
you should go to five star hotels but yo have to leave a 1 star review
You should ask Sam and Colby to go to there scariest place
Ryan you are either the bravest or dumbest human ever, but I gotta say I'm leaning towards the former. Normally reviews exist for a reason XD
ryan pls respond to e.r.t saying that they can leagaly sue them for more than they took out of there acc i hope they win it if they do sue them
Being dead serious right now, the fact that Ryan didn't get injured or hurt at all while at the big 6 motel is just astonishing. The amount of murders and shootings that happen there is unbelievable
It does everything start with 1 minute ago
The Detroit hotel that room with all the sofas doubles as a nightclub for the mature crowd in Detroit, basically 35 and up every weekend
As somone in missouri number 1: WE DO NOT SOUND LIKE A FARMER ONG number 2: hotels are really nostalgic here BUT AY IDK
You're so friggin adorable :))
Your lookin JACKED big guy
Ryan Trahan famous quote-IS THERE BREAST MILK IN THE FRIDGE!?!
Please give me a shout out. Because IM Diego
jammy time
Bro you don’t know how happy I was when I saw this
If you want a true one star hotel then go to the Amargosa hotel near Death Valley. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was the worst hotel experience of my entire life. I walked in a theres no way this place is a hotel. It there were creepy paintings everywhere, the smell was absolutely horrid, chunks were missing out of the walls, the carpet was lumpy, all the paint was chipping and much more.
the stud find has me crying 😭🙏
I liked and subscribed before the ghost that I couldn’t hear told me to
While he was looking at the rates, I saw somebody waiting at somebody door😮
I hate the like trend🔛🔝
I think you should do 5 star hotels for your next video
If u love Ryan Trahan like this comment ❤
Ryan u should go to the Cicle Hotel 1 like= I vote for Ryan to see🤭
Ryan, you probably won't see this comment; but do you actually post these reviews??
where is breastmilk 😧😧😭😭
Can u feel it CAN U FEEL IT
Are we not gonna talk about how Sam Golbach was in the thumbnail
Did she tell you???
Is it Not 5 stars or Hotel Hell???????????????????????????????????????
Ryan gets more deranged with every video
Do like a skittle type thing for Joy ride. :)
ok but why did jack's laugh sound exactly like gus fring's
3:45 I’m painting in bed while watching this😂😂😂
I sub
I think you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque
when you mentioned detroit michigan, idk why but I got jumpscared since I rarely hear people talk about detroit Michigan and I live in Michigan😭
You also should have watched the movie “1408” while you were staying in room 511. 😂
It’s a fly? 7:42
Jesus loves you!
That security guard was annoyed asff, n probably goin through sum shi
you should do earthship video. they are really cool.
Ryan the sleep talker😅
I live in NM ABQ
That third hotel seems like the perfect hotel to play the “elevator game” on. I would be too terrified to do it but your should give it a go.
I love that Ryan is always so honest on his reviews and there always 5 stars and most of the gosh time there are like gunshot holes and burnt tables-😂
7:14 I'm also in Michigan〽️
Yooo he met a guy named Greg 💯🔥
Why do I always watch you when I do my laundry?
leaked the wifi password at 24:09, it was valentine24
In room 13th You will meet Taylor swift
this is my favorite series your doing!! way better than the living on a penny thing ahahahahahaa......
Yeah about that last hotel. I am so shocked how often some hotels look up social media of guests. Maybe for fun? I dunno. I made a comment on Twitter about waiting for baggage forever. My hotel (a Westin) replied to the tweet telling me to contact them and they’ll send a private car ‘in hopes the remainder of [my] stay is a great one.’ Creepy.
Welcome back to Omaha, where we went from being know for a zoo and now a zoo and Ryan’s fav restaurant
kansas city kansas is better than "misery" ever will be  i hate missouri
Jesus loves you!❤
“UPS TRRUUUCCKKK”
Let's play 2 truths and 1 lie, I am short My eye color is red, and a building fell on top of my head :) so which one is the lie?
The sleep talking made me fell off my chair😭😭😂😂
Ryan is the best youtuber
BRO WHY WAS E.R.T's REVIEW SO LONG???? 🤬🤬🤬
Dang I live in NE Icould of seen  Ryan😞
I would give a 4 star on this video! GOOD VIDEO RYAN! But the only thing i hate the video is the Comment Section because there are bots who have more than 1K Subscribers and they comment or reply everywhere
woah
We need this in jamaica😅
if ghosts carry heavy static, are they more prone to being struck by lightning
The stud finder 😂
maybe the ghosts didn’t want to haunt ryan because he was a youtuber
Yea lol I saw Joyride at an REI shop
21:33 spoilers it wasn’t haunted
Is someone going to tell him that the yellow thing is for finding the wooden frame in the wall
I don’t know why the “hotel coming in in the middle of the night part” was so funny to me. I’m literally folded over laughing
Go to Wisconsin dells
The staff really exposed the hotel 😂
16:00 one of the few people that talked to ryan this much
Does that mean we get to watch Ryan sleep while we listen for ghost :)
Ryan uploaded on my Birthday!!
You should go to 5 star airbnb in Albuquerque
You HAVE to stay at the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel Nevada.
11:04 I feel so bad for the people who haven’t seen the first one 😢they must be so confused.
I think the last hotel gave you a free upgrade.
they have joy ride at  a candy store near me
Guys I saw him at a hotel doing a just dance thing😭😭😭
Ryan is so serious and unserious at the same time😂
Hi
Bro that were  I live
5:10 wait until haley hears
In smt thing 11 means DANGER ⚠️ 511? Idk wut 5 mean but it means smt danger so 17:14  RUN FROM 511😣
Should have came to the knights inn in Martinsburg WV. If there is a drug raid going on don’t worry there’s no shortage of Molly whoppers for entertainment. And the fact that it’s across from stat police… matters none lol
as someone from abq, the sirens are normal and dont ever stop especially in that area
i keep meaning to watch this! Im like oh lets watch.. Time to watch it... 3 days pass... Finally I watch it!
You should do your candy that you released joyride so that the sharks can either invest or that people will see the show and will know more that your candy exists
If you see this comment...              Now you know I like your mom
11:58 GEOMETRY DASH REFERENCE
I’m Detroit he missed out on the Henry ford museum nearby like if he does not like cars or trains I can’t blame him but if it’s not the case he just really missed out and just sayin Henry ford made some pretty good lookin cars
“
Skibidi toilet
Bro did NOT find David😭😭💀💀
ERT was NOT happy that day 💀
I live 5 minutes away from the 2nd hotel
‘Haunted toilets’ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 15:00
16:46 are we going to talk about the exit door opening
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
How the flip did you just watched kun-fu-panda 😅 29:38
Hi
1. reason why prince philips is haunted:  the elevator has a 13th floor 0_0
22:43 TLDR: Contact Abby booked us here instead of Embassy Suites. Staff held onto credit cards, bad fridge, no microwave, dangerous and slippery shower. Other negative reviews had BED BUG complaints, the hallway is very musty. Couldn't sleep at all the whole night. Overcharged us 200$. Elevator made weird noises.
From some reason when you subscribe it won’t let you and it won’t let you like the video it says error
I was there in downtown where you were meet me in downtown.
I love your videos
My brother was just doing his homework and he came across donuts, spelt, wrong and he was is it donuts I always spelt it DONUTS but apparently that’s right it was spelt DOUGHNUTS that’s how donuts were spelt in the passage when he was doing his homework. How do you spell donuts in British I think they spell donuts, DOUGHNUTS UTS
Bro live in Omaha pls i live there!!
people who read ert 22:43
r u sure it wasn't danny gonzalez you played shuffleboard with
4:28 solar eclipse
22:48 I think ERT was just a little upset guys can someone check up on them
5:49 damn he can pull up
I liked this video with my nose
I love how every hotel he goes to he checks if there is breast milk in the fridge 😭 💀 😂
‘ I almost bought bitcoin in 2011’
I live in MI
Just stayed at an airbnb and wanted to leave a  1 star review for Ryan Trahan to see. Guess I’m late.
I need more sour strips got me rolling on the floor 😂😂😂
YOU WONT LIKE THIS COMMENT
Why did he check under the bed?
when you dont know what to watch on youtube, just remember this guy exists.
Ryan never fails to entertain me for the whole video lol. your one of the only youtubers who's videos i ACTUALLY all the way through. you make me laugh so much, keep it up.
I made an animated series on GTA V and need to reach my first 100,000 🙏🏻🔥
I’m sorry but the thought of him having to re-cross the street after filming himself walking away is really funny 😂
I LOVE TOUR VIDS
A stud finder is not ghost gear 😂
“Jammy time” 😂
Just a question... How does he always wake up without the jammies?
Haha, Speaking of the pinned comment yeah i agree Motel 6 is crazy!!
10:06 lol
I read  the whole thing
Ok buddy, you walk into a hotel and stuff looks like it has been on fire, BULLET HOLES EVERYWHERE.... ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!?????
FÜR DER SCHNITZEL UND DER RATTE
“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011 😈”
i don’t know how to feel, i’m sad you jay walked in the kansas hotel u.u ily regardless great video!!!
The last one is literally a apartment😭
ryan NEEDS to do a vid with sam, colby, johnnie, jake and tara
How'd E R T wright all that geez
that first one is from breaking bad
First time wearing pjs tho?
You should have reviewed Jackson Mississippi hotels
Ppl who stayed to watch him eat milk and cookies  👇
Bro didn't bring Luigi's vacuum for 511 💀💀💀💀💀
9:56 THat is literaly the backrooms I get vibe from looking at it.
9:24 it looks like they used cardboard cut outs to take that
who remebers when ryan tried to pass dr phill in subscribers. he's now passing sour patch kids. he's on a quest.
A                                                                            A
I live in NE ive been here
I own a 5 star Airbnb in Clackamas if you wanna check it out
Yo I was so suprised when you said Missouri bc I’m from Missouri and I still live here
You sound like sonic you should do a sonic act
That motel six is known by everyone in abq as a very  sketchy and dangerous motel
The desk lady at the Kansas City haunted hotel seemed like such a sweetie,I love enthusiasm 😭😭
Go to ambassador inn on menaul room 112 in Albuquerque it is very haunted.
I swear every motel 6 looks like it’s been burned down and built back up
Make a dog toy
how jack was js like 😅👍
At the 2nd hotel why is there a Canadian and an American flag there?
All three kung fu panda movie's are great but the third one is disappointing mess It doesn't deserve to be called a DreamWorks movie it reminds me of Megamind 2
Shark tank was the onener
don't listen to the vegan teacher, Ryan you're perfect as is. if you have no idea what I'm talking about, good.
imagine cuddling with your partner and in they’re sleep they say “i almost bought bitcoin in 2011”
You should do roller coasters next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you should do a review in Minnesota
Bring joyride to Canada
Least entertaining Ryan video (the joke is that none of Ryan’s videos are boring)   also guys please stop like begging
M
3:40
Ryan lives on the edge (jk, but I love your vids dude, keep it up!)
Me and my mom love you and every time it’s about night time she says can we watch Ryan Trahan and we just love you❤❤❤❤
“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011”
Do anything for clout, they do anything for clout.
This is crazy what he does for us
RYAN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. NEXT TIME YOU GO TO ALBUQUERQUE YOU HAVE TO GO TO FRONTIER. 🙏🙏🙏 (personally I think their breakfast is the best)
Ryan, I just found you on YouTube.  I don't watch tiktok.  I just love you and your sense of humor.  Be safe out there.  I've traveled the world via US Army and unfortunately have seen the best and worst of it.  But damn, what a great job you have.  Take care, from Pittsburgh.  Beth
At hotel philips he became same and colby
the classic oof before showing the rating😅
Hi! Thanks for visiting my hometown, Kansas City!  😁
Fact: some people leave 1 star reviews  because they wanna keep the amazing stuff to them selves
you really love the world huh
Hi
YUHHHGG MISSSSSOURIIIIII ITS EITHER HILLBILLES OR CITY RATS!!!!
did the security guard make those noises??
Ryan gang 👇
Bro was in room 211 and his upside down card looked like a 9💀☠💀💀☠
soooo good
go to the motel 6 in truth or consequences, it is sketch, the overall vibe in that community is very off.
KUNG FU!
Ok
The ball of sun was Literally the ball from goku.
Who read the loooooooong review 👇
How fast did bro start trending 💀
You should go to 5 star hotels and honestly rank them 1 star
Ryan should do the penny challenge in a hotel lol
i love joyride.
I read ert review and it hurt my eyes
Wonder what’s in the fridgeeeeee
I love you so much
Will Joyride be in retail stores in Canada 🇨🇦 🤔
"this thing" in min 17:04 and its a stud finder 😭😭
“……Jerry…that was beautiful”
Nah, that last hotel is insane. Ain’t no way it’s one star.
Holy cow, the elevator door opened!  A ghost must have hit all the buttons!
What’s TikTok the only cringe app
agree on trade
17:48, the edit is so smooth
22:14 Well the refrigerator is warm on the outside because it extracts heat to make the inside cold. If the inside is hot, then it is a problem.
28:13 yes I will trade this. It is a good trade idea.
22:44 please help. I READ IT ALL, I CANT FEEL MY EYES!!! MY EYES ARE RED. J.R.T PLEASE SHAME ON YOU AND I WILL BE CONTACTING YOUR MANAGER
its a stud finder not a ghost detector
NEBRASKA MENTIONED
albuquerque new mexico? Waltuh??
Vanity seems so kind
...cant believe im late to his video...
im sure that security guard was very annoyed 😂😂
ryan call customer services and rate them
UPS TRUCK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
Ryan be capping, the st ridges hotel Detroit is 3.5 stars. To lazy to check the others but that’s SUS and the other ones could be higher stars. Also did not see a review by Ryan.
OH EM GEEE KC YUHH 🤘🏻
There’s a another haunted hotel in Taos nm called la Fonda
Bro the plate was covered in blood
Ryan, try doing staying at best reviewed hotels
Hershey got some serious competition now with this one 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
2:11 Yeah from memory super8 even if it is mostly if not all civilian located/oriented of a bussiness it really tbh strives to have and uphold and to establish cleanliness and hospitality  as the priority for the customers ngl... so idk but never stayed at a motel 6 so ig glad to not have in hindsight based on this in the first locations result on the video.
The guy coughing just disintegrated. It happens all the time for me.
WOOOOOO
Oh yeah, I think three is the lie
UWU❤❤❤😍🍑🍆
literally the funniest youtuber ever
Which app you are using?
I pick         None me have no jams and mink And cookies:( one star ⭐

Amazing
Poopoo
I coughed at the same   time
WHEN HE TALKED IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT SOUR STRIPS THO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
16:34 its the one thing that we didn't want to happen
21:52 Thats 2 megaBITs per second, not 2 megaBYTEs per second. Basically that means it's 8 times slower
2:12 OMG💅
I accept the trade.
2nd hotel is a new backrooms level
Ryan: This ramen seems yummy  Me 5 seconds later: WHAT THE FU-
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS 😫😩
So you didn't review 1 star hotels... you reviewed 1 star COMMENTS? Like out all 4 of the hotels , only the first hotel was rated 1.6 with the rest being 2.0 , 3.1 and 3.0  Kindda deceiving if you ask me
when he asks where is the vending machine to the security guard and he gets mad
XD 😂
I just clicked this video on 6,666,666 views 🔥🔥
bro the first one was like the movie sicario what
You should go to a 5 star place and you have to leave the lowest review ever
Guys... I LIVE IN KAMSAS CITY AND I MISSED RYAN WHAT THE HECK. 😢
did the guy yell you about the vending machine or not?
(title) i tested 1 star reviews also him going to a 3.1 and a 3.0 star review
THE CHAMELEONAAAA
I hope Ryan knows that there are screws every 18 inches… 19:13
118$ fairly cheap?
I love these videos!!!
ALMOST 6,666,666 VIEWS
deep inhale exhale "How many times do I have to be asked because of that one f*in review?"
18:47 why he using a stud finder💀
next hotel one go to bisbee Arizona its haunted
When Ryan looks for breastmilk in the hotel fridge 😂
Who read the whole big reveiw
legends  say david still is waiting for his food
Joyride is fully sold out :( also do they ship to Australia?
do a haunted hotel vid with sam and colby!! hehehe
Hey Ryan question: are you a Cristian? As in you love Jesus as a Christian ✝️  pls reply
I didn't like my own comment
ANTS are time-of-year specific.
As a paranormal investigator this is very funny to me and I am now booking a trip to hotel Phillips
15:01
Someone comment the name of the Omaha Nebraska hotel below
If you ever have an encounter just stand up and say "Leave in the name of Jesus!" It worked for me!
3 days 6.6milion views wow
Bout to eat imos ya
You should do testing 5 star hotels but I have to leave an honest one star rewiew
homie was playing phasmophobia  2004 was so damn pretty
Ryan has an W Draw line)
Uhm did no one notice every time he switched hotels the stars went up
You should go to the motel one in albuquerque
jammy time?!?!??!??!?!??!?!?!?
Nebraska is simply better
My son watches your videos and I got into the hotel review one. We are currently watching this one and your deadpan sarcasm makes me laugh 😂. Your nervousness and being scared also made the mom side of me be like, "I shall protect him!!!!" 😂. For bedbug investigation I heard you could use some spray? Was it vinegar? Spray it on headboards and corners of mattresses to see if they scurry out. Look it up and if you try it, say HI MIKEY (my son's name). 🎉
16:37 Ryan's so terrified, he aged by 10 years
i stayed in a 1 star hotel in baltimore, literally gun shots all throughout the night, drugs being sold left and right, tricks walking in and out of rooms. But other than that, i literally had the best time ever. Got some good weed for cheap, met some cool people just in bad situations, got my hair braided and it looked amazing. But again im from florida so all basically made me like like i was just home.
Because I live in a haunted house, it gets triggered when we give it attention when Ryan was going on about the haunted hotel I heard it breathe lol
Wait this was 3 days ago? I just seen this in Walmart. Not released yet i don't think but yeah. Seen the new stuff too
If he reply’s *inhale* I will go to Walmart *POUR WATER ON THE FLOOR AND SAY THATS THERE NO WET FLOOR SIGN, THEN RUN ACROSS AS FAST AS I CAN THEN GET HURT AND SCREAM THE LOUDEST IVE EVER SCREAMED,AND SUE THE F4 OUT OF THEM THEN I WILL OWN WALMART*
im disappointed that you left omaha without getting runza again 😢
This man didn't just say the movie was fire😭😭
Ryan wouldn't reply prove me wrong
Solo un poco de ingles
26:34 he did not just get medium over medium rare
I want the front desk lady in the haunted one to be my best friend forever and ever
20:06 😅
MUST MAXIMIZE THE CHILDREN MONEY  -sponsored by kung fu -candy company that he really just gave a lot of money to to easily sell right away with no work -jammy time
I know how good kung fu panda 4 is its better then jamai time
22:43 One star review? More like one star roman
Bruh bout a stud finder just to entertain us 😂 we love you Ryan
Please do Canada next
that first hotel was definitely from "Better Call Saul"
JAMMY TIME!!
That security guard was definitely annoyed 😂
Omg I live in Omaha!!! 24:30 you should totally move here!😄😁😁
We wanna see more haunted hotel reviews
Ryan's description: Just a guy Me: oh hey thats me
The stud finder bit made me laugh even tho I knew it was coming the whole time. Almost like anti humor hahaha
Id believe the last hotel was looking your name up before you came there and gave you the nicest room. You have another video where you review 1 star hotels
Please send the sour strips and candies to Canada, Walmart or something pls
I live in Kansas City and I always pass that hotel when I’m going to my parents work place I never thought or heard of it being haunted before nor did I think any of my favorite YouTubers would go there! I just think it’s cool seeing Ryan visit my city :)
"jammy time" is a new MUSTT
I just wanna know why the haunted rooms are almost always the last room in a hallway
The way he inhaled and exhaled when he asked about the vending machines
They are not haunted by ghosts, only demons.
Who thinks Ryan should spend a day with Sam and Colby in room 511?
19:37 "i don't know what I'll do" yeah gg for you bro r.i.p
They did Po dirty
17:59 I swear I'm not dirty minded
Albuquerque, I’m not going there, but if you ever go there again, please don’t choose the wrong restaurant, if you see an RV, run.
great to see you visit Detroit again
26:16 Po looks like certain someone that is German and has a small moustache.
Ryan you should make a video about making the most sour warhead in the ENTIRE WORLD for 15m likes and then eat it or have someone else eat it
Thank you i live is cplombia MO
Does it stress anyone else out when he leaves the camera across the street
@Waltuh, I saw Ryan Trahan on my way to Gus’s, Waltuh”     -A Kid Named Finger

Ryan Amazing Video and everything, but the steak, Ordering a steak medium is a crime...
“I’m sorry, did the ghost wipe your butt?”  -Ryan 2024

Today is my birthday! 🎉 i love watching your videos they make me happeh :)
Ryan plz can you make a orange flavour of the joyride sour strips
17:05 bro brought a stud finder to look for ghosts 😂. It’s used for finding the framing in walls called studs
The security guard 😂
ngl she probably gave you room 511 because you asked about the haunted stuff
ryan keep up with the vidoes i watch you everyday sorry i wasant subsicribed its a new pc
Hey i was wondering about your joyride gummys are they allergy safe like i have a peanut allergy and was not sure if i could eat them so please get back to me. ❤
:D
Obviously he got the haunted room he told the staff that he was there because he heard it was haunted, they're giving him the haunted room
16:33 she gave you that room because you said you were there cause it was haunted
u came to my home town detroit mi
I love how Ryan put Baloons TD music over the background
I feel bad for him bc he got room 511 😭
Ryan you should go all over the world and do this challenge  man your content is too  good to only keep in the USA bro
JELYRADE
KAN YU LANS IT IN SWEDEN
Just Bro's named David can coment lets see...
The first hotel was next to my house that I live the most (521 Caprice Ct,NC)
Ryan, next time you may be in a room with a ghost, God Forbid, Dont go yapping about said ghost.
You and my father have matching jammies you just need a blue robe
I remember when you were in an underwater hotel
16:11 I stand for Vanity, she seems nice lol
joride pls
You actually barely have to watch kung fu panda to understand kung fu panda four you really only need to watch the first one and you’ll get the jest of the characters the fourth one fills you in on the past villains. It’s just a bad movie.
Good video Ryan❤❤❤
In every hotel video, gotta check the fridge for breastmilk 😭
15:35  funny
16:45
Why
20:50 lol
Idc “I seem to have made a mistake” got the hell out of me 😂
1:28 <> omg I cannot trust that door
The stud finder bit was just too good
at the third hotel i was like:  NO JAMMY TIME??? :(
I just made dinner and started watching and eating then I see a toilet with shit in it...
Now I really want you to collab with Sam and Colby that would be so epic
Bro your hotel journey is AMAZING I wish u could post everyday bc the vids keep running out🥲
Days ago I found a hotel with vomit all over the place so keep up the good work
hi
I think I've stayed at that first one
0:55
Stud detector got me laughing
17:59 what did he say 😅
BRING IIT TO UAE PLS THE CANDY. THANK U BY ME
4:19 i think you only come by whenever its a good day because if you like really live there it gets miserable and the weather is kinda mid (but yes the sunsets here are the best)
Ryan you should vist hotel forum in Bulgaria Sofia City its verry nice it wont disappoint you
Vanity was so nice👀
What brand are those pull up rings @5:50
i think we would all LOVE to see ryan go to cecil hotel🤣
Ayyy new Mexico lets goo😂
This is tbh my favorite series
Hotel n2 has TWO stars!!!!!U scammed me!!JK love U ryan
Nah you didnt watch Kung Fu Panda on youtube
18:50  Ryan, that's called a stud. It's used to construct things.

ryan you should go to rainforest cafes 💂‍♂

My hint has. Correct bc when you went to 5 floor I instantly thought that it is room 511
Awesome
awesome
can you send joyride to india pls
e
Yoooooo that first motel is pretty close to my house😅
I watched the movie it’s fire 🔥
You should bring a black light
if im being honest from where i live st. regis is very luxurious ive been there, but i think this branch is js the bad one
2:09 somehow I don’t think John is the one who did that. I think he came in and that’s what he saw. Because I went into a bathroom once in a shitty little hotel motel in the backwards part of my province and the toilet looked like that, and I went back out to the front desk and I was like hey can you fix that toilet cause it’s all fucked up. I was only gone for three minutes because the first thing I went to go do was pee, but I couldn’t pee because the toilet was like that blame me and tried to charge my credit card.
I’m convinced Vanity recognized his name when he reserved his room and gave him 511 for the vid 😂
I love your candy
We should appreciate him he travels far to keep us entertained ☆
Just a reminder that it's not 2 mega bytes, it's 2 mega BITS.
Vanity was such a sweetheart 😭
i wonder how ryan went to sleep in the last hotel with pajamas and came out shirtless 🤨🤨🤨
THE SECURITY GUARD 💀💀💀
Ryan has a FX3 and films majority with his iPhone haha.
"I almost Bought Bitcoin in 2011" is the thing that i didn't think i would ever hear from sleeping person😂
The green stuff on the faucets are probably just limescale.
my internet used to be 2mbs 😭
I would love to see you do 1 star reviews at haunted hotels!
ryan is so good at this stuff. hes so fun
on 18:52 why was bro using a stud finder...XD
I suddenly have the urge to watch all the kung fu panda movies
Don't translate... ฉันจะสมัครรับข้อมูลใครก็ตามที่สมัครรับข้อมูล ฉันและชอบความคิดเห็นนี้...
Seralago Hotel & Suites 5678 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Kissimmee, FL 34746  Try to put a 5star hotel on that shit 😅😂
Is Haley his gf??
I have a feeling that Rebecca is the ghost
you probarly got room 511 becasue you were checking if it was haunted
Albuquerqueans warn against any motel near the freeway. Crime is sky high...
“I’m gonna play with my toys now” What do you mean by that?😂😂😂
Ryan finally wore some pants in a video
"Did the ghost wipe your butt" 😭😭😭
Vanity is such a vibe fr
We need part 3😊
We need part 3😊
As a person living in Barbados, I know for a fact that Joy Ride isn't coming in a store near me 😭😭😭
We need par 😁
Ryan can I get joyride guys if you want to support pls like this comment
❤ Ryan, your content is just…….. Brilliant! Love the reviews! Keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉 YeAHhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!🎉 yahooooooo! 😂
Why dont you ask a restaurant for a yelper special

Hello Ryan
Did the ghost wiped your butt got me dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂 😂 😂
I live in isreal and i’ve been looking for joyride evrywhere
My brother said he sounds like randy cunningham (Ben Shwartz) and now i can't unhear it
"I am sorry, did the Ghost wipe your butt" caught me offgards 😂😂
I love your vids  i hope u get 100m subs!❤❤
You should rate 0 star hotels
spooky scary stud finder
Hi 👋
Day 1 asking you to go to freedom hotel in in Phuket thailand
That "oof" sound from roblox got me so hard😂
Hey tryan,,  is it hard to get  a plane ticket that connects the cities in an order, like from up to down, your flying too much, in every review video,
You didn’t watch the show though
You said "wacky activity" which is a totally missed opportunity to say "wacktivity".
What are the chances of you getting Room 511 😂
You should do you a collab with @PPPeter, both of you have excellent worst reviewed videos!
Do you guys know how to get a bunch of subs if you know I need info 😅
I love the kung fu panda movies My favs: 1: kfp 2 2: kfp 4 3: kfp 1 4: kfp 3
Bro casually left Sony FX3 outside the room 511. That shit's expensivee...
colab with Sam&Colby
Because you asked about it being haunted, they intentionally put you in the haunted room
you should book the hotel under another name or else they might give you special treatment like at the last hotel
like this comment if you think JAMMY TIME! is the best time!
ryans vids are actually some of the only good content on youtube anymore lmao
I love your vids but i wanted to go see your review on the 2 hotel and didnt see it i checked all 400
walking in detroit is crazy
Brings the stud finder 😂😂
Albuquerque breaking bad
the last one does not deserve those reviews! i went to India recently to sing with two choirs and i loved them! the last hotel reminds me of them :)
I was just in omaha and i stayed in a comfort inn (it was having renovations done) but something about it just felt eerie to me, ended up waking up sick at like 5 and the elevator was VERY delayed, almost thought it was haunted when i went to take the stairs instead of the elevator (didnt know it was delayed yet) it opened when i was like right at the stairs, very scary.
You should colab with Sam and Colby that would be funny 😂
All the comments are from bots Edit: also there's so much ants in the hotel it's out of hand
REI the camping store has all the joyride candys they are so good.
I GONNA TRY THEM TOO!!!!

This is a stupid place This place smells like poop This place has 5 billion ants Worst place in the world  👨 Donald dump  ★★★★★  Me: why did you give it a 5 star rating?
Rural motel Martinsville Indiana is -2 stars
The Greatest Reviewer didn't review Kung Fu Panda. 😞
you're in luck because kung fu panda 4 has literally nothing to do with the first 3 movies. 1/10, disappointing movie.
You need to review 1 star hotel around the world
I’m happy Tai Lung is good now but Lord shen and Kai good? That just makes no sense whatsoever!😂
Detroit was 2 stars not one
Can you try 5 stars hotel???
Pls more rating and camping vids
joyride in uk?
It is now a tradition that with  our friends we watch the latest Ryan Trahan vid lol
Yo!  That's so cool that my city (Omaha, NE) is on people's radars!  I just wish it was for a better scenario 😅.  But I'm glad it got a good review!!!  I think a lot of people sleep on Omaha 😀
Ryan Brother will Candy Come Till India?
that last hotel room is better than my house
my go to person to watch and eat my food
the voice sometimes is like a karen lol
"panda"
ryan i beg of you PLEASE go to the Ramada Inn in the out skirts of Atlanta Georgia, my volleyball team stayed there 4 years ago and i have a HIGH tolerance for stuff like this but there was a man taking a dump in the door way outside and when we got inside our room there was blood on the walls. The whole team checked out the next day and the staff said they didn't blame us.
"Jammy time."    - Ryan Trahans description in this vid
18:00 "I'm gonna play with my toys now" - Ryan Trahan 2024

Hope you brought your Po plushy to the movies
Next video
Get klay victor02
King fuu panda 4 was sadly bad
“Did the ghost wipe your butt?” BARS BRO ABSOLUTE BARS🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro I think Vanity is the female equivalent of Ryan
15:32 i bet he had a hard time getting his phone back
I love how Ryan is like Is it true it’s haunted? And she is just like YES!
Where did you found kung fu panda 2
hi ryan does joy rides shiped to thailand?
it would be cool if you did the opposite, i.e. go to 4-5 star hotels and try to leave only one star
Ryan is so cool and popular
"this thing🤔"
The 2nd hotel is the legit bad one lol
Also the new candy is sour gummy worms I saw some at the store
Dam wish I knew you were in Omaha
My name is ryan too 😅
E
Ryan literally tried to live in Heisenberg area!
Stay in the Cecil Hotel for 3 nights
bro really bought 4 rooms to find an excuse to watch kingfu panda
Why do you wake up with NOOOOO clothes what happened ( shivering in fear)
You should check out Harrah's in council bluffs ia
You are the best
You always have to leave a 5 start
Ert went crazy dang 22:44
The second hotel looks like a hotel I've went to before and im creeped out😭🙏

6 is 666 wiches haunted
14:10 UPS TRUCK 🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌🥶🥶🥶🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🥶🥶🥶💯💯💯👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️
The 2nd hotel room's alarm is giving off room 1408 lol
man that roblox death sound though
On July 2023 I stayed in a hotel for 4 days and 3 nights, and I went home with diarrhea mainly due to the hotel's breakfast.  Maybe Ryan could test a hotel where they serve breakfast, but the food is awful and unhygienic
Was shocked when I saw you come to omaha for runza, was even more shocked when I saw you came to omaha yet again and was walking around downtown. Crazy.
hi @ryan trahan please accept this challenge:  Adopt a Forest... Bring your fans and plant million of trees... please...   I thought, you are able to do it because you have the money, facility, time, resource and influence to do it...
3:40 dude you have to check in the corners of the bed for bedbugs not the sheets
The movie was trash
7:18 thanks for visiting the great mitten!

Petition for ryan to give us an update on the ecosystem
HOW HAVE U NOT WATCHED KUNG FU PANDA RYAN. THATS ACTUALLY INSANITY
"Let's see if there's breast milk in the fridge!" man of culture i see
I was thinking of getting one for myself and my family but  I’m afraid to ask because I’m going through
BRO, VANITY IS SO NICE OMG
If i would be in a room that is haunted i would not sleep
Shame on you Ryan for not watching kung fu panda sooner Jk :) please don’t end me😅😊😮
come to Australia Redcliffe
Bad idea
Shark tank is great and addicting!
could not have physically clicked faster when i saw this video 😂 i adore these videos!! so eager for the next
The way ryan turned his camera from the blue chair😂
L Ryan for using castefiy
THE WAY THE GUARD LEGIT BREATHED IN AND OUT. ?? 12:13 HE'S SO MAD
Ryan should do the polar oppisite with 5 star hotels.
keewl
bro absolutely roasted my internet speeds
Ryan trahan is so cool
Ryan i have a question is Joy Ride in india? I really wanna try it!
I have a feeling the last hotel knew who he was and put him in one of the newer nicer rooms.
You were in my dream at my school
I read the long review about the Magnolia...  Yes, it does seem like they suck, A LOT. Buutttt, to say your "week was ruined" bc they put 2 $100 holds on your account when you're in town to perform and make 1000s of dollars seems to be pretty dramatic.
you didnt rate the movie
Hotel 2 looks like a mental institution
Ryan would you still go back to hotel phillips again? BTW pls answer
The breast milk thingy was a legend 😂
JACK 5 STARS
1730
bro the asking the security guard where's the vending machine part is very funny😭
DID U JUST SAY BREAST MILK
Should've given that 1st Hotel/Motel a Bonus Point for having no monsters under the bed.  JAMMY TIME.
For the third hotel (the haunted one) is not great to watch when random squeaks and creaks and the door is moving back and forth. No
I’ve seen someone make a candy knife handle with the strips.
breaking bad reference?

I hate bots!
"1 star hotel" shows a 3 star hotel at the end
what is the song that he plays when he gets out of bed at the end?
what would your shark tank product?
Comiste hoy Ryan?
Hey new candy idea how about the new  candy called the " joyride rainbows "
i seen all the kung fu panda
Speaking of haunted Hotel room, why not do a video on testing out Haunted Hotels? I know theres hundreds out there, maybe just pick the top 5 most haunted ones?
Ryan deserves to test 5-star hotels now!
Bro is it just me or did u see that sam from  Sam and Colby is on the front cover
I stayed at st regis when I went to Psychopathic records by ICP, my room was very nice, but I also paid bookoo money I paid like 400 for a room. I challenge you to come to Tennessee and do this challenge with me.
Toilets dead bro 💀
bullet holes, 5 star. cool story.
bro is trying not to scream in elevator (i think the elevator is the scariest part)
“Did the ghost wipe your but”💀💀💀
my dog started barking when you endterd the room 511 coincdence????
I’m glad that I’m no longer the only one checking for breast milk in every hotel fridge I stumble upon. Thanks Ryan!
Now do the opposite. Go to every 5 star hotel n leave a 1 star review honeatly
Not my fault, the plumbing needed work.
It says dont go in room 13 on the thumbnail because people are petty and think it is an unlucky number
i just reakised i wasnt subbed dont worryu i subbed
Bring JOYRIDE to Romania please!!!!
Welcome to breaking bad
pls go to Switzerland🥺
ding dong
I didnt find any of your comments😢
11:07 AYO WHAT DID BRO SAY!!???
challenge idea: go to ever 1 star review hotel in all the states
Get me to 10k likes or else Ryan will steal your credit card
I crave vanitys positivity
THE NEXT 4TH CANDY IS FRUIT BEAR GUMMIES
But what if the hotel actually sucks ? Wouldn’t giving them a 5 star rating be misleading?
Lad os få en reaktion fra Johnni Gesus
Do u know where the vending machine is ☺️ mm haaa 😡
The kung fu panda movies are not connected !!! Right ??😅

Howdy
The fact that Ryan left an FX3 outside of his door is beyond me. 21:28
"i'm out of sour strips" was the scariest part of that haunted 511 room
Hey Ryan... Can we move on? This format was fun but this is kinda too much - love your content :)
Need part "agai again.."

If you want to come to a 1920s hotel in Los Angeles California which is now a low income housing and very haunted and very known I live here I’m trying to move I’m waiting to be moved but currently I am still here at the Cecil hotel in downtown LOSANGELES if you ever want to come visitI can have one guest per visit but it’s crazy if you wanna make a video
Imagine if Ryan goes to the Cecil Hotel… I would be GLAD!
David has still been waiting for his food till this day…
Ok
Ryan, you bought a stud finder
26:13 THEY GOT MONSTER HIGH THERE??? Oh I need to go there.
I meannn u did tell Vanity (desk lady) that you were at the hotel cause you heard it was haunted...maybe she purposely put u in the haunted room n thought she was helping 😂
Why were you naked when you woke up at the last hotel 😂
I love this soooo much ❤😊
Make a video of you going to 5 star hotels and rating them 1 star without lying
I traveled to India several years ago and stayed in a one star hotel. The bedding had not been changed for a very long time, I had to share a toilet that was a literal hole in the floor, and the worst part of all, the owner was mean! But for $6 a night, couldn't beat it with a stick!
W Jammy time 👍😝
Ola
RYAN!!!! can joyride ship to Australia pleaseEEEEEEEEE
RYAN HOW HAVE YOU NOT WATCHED KUNG FU PANDA AS A CHILD!!!! Like what?!
According to Chinese Feng Shui, any room that is located directly opposite of a staircase/exit is bad luck...So it makes sense if spooky things stay inside.
you should make a video of only staying in haunted hotels
The sirens are obv fire trucks cause everything’s always on fire in New Mexico 😂
TACO!!!!!
Any apartment in nyc
5:39 “Kung-Fu Panda is loading” idk why but it’s just the way he said made me crack up😂
Ryan I love your videos and I have a idea of make like joyride worms kinda like trollis.
Who saw the 1st one ? Here! 👇🏻 edit1: if anyone thinks i mean “Motel 6” i mean the one he did *BEFORE* .
13:54. algae is pronounced as al-gay
Moral of the story: Go to 1 star hotel because they're the best hotels
Mi amor
rates 1 star hotels first place is a motel
“Panda Express… I can’t see” 😭😭😭
22:43 I ain't readin' allat.
If you cant lie in the review, then why did you set a rule where you can only give 5 star reviews, when none of the hotels were even 3 star quality.
Legand says david is still waiting for his food..
It is simply… JAMMY TIME
Legend has it..David is still waiting for his food at Hotel St.Regis Ryan Trahan:Imma go find him!
IM FROM DETROIT MICHIGANNNNN✌️
You belle ex
😮😮#4 is better than my house😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Hello Me! I bet you’re gonna rewatch this so see ya!
My guy liedd 💀💀 abt KUNG FU PANDA 👁👄👁
17:49 cleanest transition
i love your videos
I been in a haunted hotel before. When I was in it my cousin saw blood on the edge then I went to go check and there was a blood spot. The hallway was also scary.
People who're tired of "if you don't come from tiktok" top comment 👇
The plumbing dont work ryan: TIME TO TAKE A SHITTTT💅
so cool watching ryan walk around downtown omaha as I'm there almost everyday
The fact that Ryan travels so much for these 1 star reviews are insane🤯
As someone from Nebraska I have never experienced a horrible hotel but I'm pretty sure its just the country experience you can't expect much from a small town
i actually read ghe super long review. My eyes hurt now
Ryan I don’t think your aloud to have yelp elite if you own a business :(  I dint know if this is true I just saw it on google
I live in abq and motel 6 is basically an active warzone
Ryan needs to do a ghost hunting video, or is that just me who thinks that.
YOOOOOOO! i live in Albuquerque!!! the Sandias are so fun to mountain bike!!!!
Motel: doors are outside Hotel: doors are inside
22.43 what the Frick I ain’t no way I’m already reading that. I’m sorry I’ll take me five hours and I’ll probably die.
Funny video! Excited for joyride arriving at retailers!
Dude pj are soooooooo comfortable
11:04 This is such a funny thing to say out of context 😭
Do Cecil. I personally believe in spirits n stuff so I would pass lol
Do you get up to record yourself getting out of bed, or do you let the camera roll all night long? Very curious to know.
Ryan is a crazy YouTube I mean he's just confident
Day 1 of trying get on shark tank. Video idea??
He gotta go to 5 star stuff next he has had to go to 1 stars for so long give him some justice
Now try I tested 5 star hotels like the best ones
Y'all remember when Ryan would cuss a crap ton in his videos
20:30  if you pay attention very very well you can spot in the vidéo a nice handsome man with a pajama watching kong fu panda 3
Please launch it to Mongolia
Forget “THE GAMEPLAN” welcome to “Jammy time”
Hi Ryan! Is joyride kosher? I’d love to get some but can’t if the product isn’t kosher.
" I'm out of sour strips " best statement in mankind
can someone tell Jeff_264 that im outside his house
As someone who watches Sam and Colby and knows a lot about spirits when he was using the stud finder, I literally said that’s a fucking stud finder😂😂😂
Adopt me please
I would check more for bed bugs, they’ll crawl into your stuff and come home with you to take your blood while you’re sleeping
There are definitely way worse reviewed hotel in Detroit bro was just scared to leave downtown
His reaction to the stud finger is un matched
Is he going to put them in Canada
You Need To Get A UV Light If You’re Going To Make Another
I wanna see one of these but he goes to a hotel and gives it the opposite review (giving a 1 star hotel 5 stars, 2 star hotel 4 stars, 4 star hotel 2 stars and 5 star hotel 1 star)
spend the night in a haunted hotel for 2 days
Going to a 2 star hotel in Detroit is brave
STOP HE WENT TO MY STATE!?
I’m two days late
One time I was in a hotel and it actually looks like the backrooms
Ants :)
how did he like kung fu panda 4...
just saw joyride in walmart!! They had a bunch on sale for 4$ a pop i had to get them all! haha
St Regis was't bad when I was there years ago. Had nice staff
How aboutttttt THE NORMAL LAUGHING EMOJI????????😂😂😂😂
26:13 that ain’t king fu panda that’s the karate bear
Breast milk???
The “like and subscribe” recording was funny as heck!!!!!
Hell ya Kansas City in my state!
22:43 tldr: the reviewer is a kids performer that got overdrafted for 200$ for incidentals and complaining about generic rude/bad service. Honestly that's a good read.
kungfu panda 2 is best
*Beautiful music playing* Panda.
you should do a video where you visit 5 star hotels and have to leave a 1 star review
When will you do an update to the tiny ecosystem?

You should go to the Cecil hotel.
I hope you love KansasCity  as much as I do❤
YOU MUST FIND A HOTEL IN MINNESOTA!!
Hear me out on jake from State Farm PLEASEEE
The stud finder bit was hilarious!
You even liked the 4th Kung Fu Panda movie. 😭😭 I would say its okaaay, the weakest of the 4.
For every like this comment gets I will take one step
Now make a video by staying in 5-star hotels but you have to rate it 1-star and you can't lie
lmao idk if you’ll see this but how’d you like kung fu panda 2?😭 its my favorite movie of all time so i’d want to hear your review!! :))
You should go to a hotel in Scotland I went to one and there where pins sticking out of the couch and strange holes in the wall
That one with Poudin was the worst hotel
Hey rayan I had your gummy bears and they are awesome I made a video about them reviewing it
Bro i live right next to kanas city my road is literally the road before kansas city💀
You should make Gummies for your candy too
Space the final frontier these are the recruits of the starship enterprise going where no one had gone before
“I don’t have a wetsuit, but I have socks.”   Ryan trahan April 2024
jack look like a such good person, I really want to be his friend!!!!
Vanity was tryna fuck
28:11 I would without a doubt accept that offer

Trade Offer at 28:01
Vanity needs a fricking raise.
12:15 yo wtf 😂😂
IM SORRY I TRIED TO BRAKE IN
26:15  that man had seen some stuff💀
I’m so disappointed. I stayed at this hotel the first time I stayed in Kansas City and actually liked it so much I went back to stay again. It’s give it a very solid 4 stars. I can’t wait to go back and stay again. These people are crazy. I hope you went to power and light to party
Love these vids

How was he in the city I live in!!!  and I never knew….  :(  ★☆☆☆☆
Bro I want to be on one of your videos pls
Hey Ryan, i live in Michigan, actually not to far from Detroit, in almost every hotel I've been in the halls are horrifying, though I've never seen one so scratched up before
TOO MANY BOTS!!! AHHHHH!!!!!!!!
WOW okay Ryan, just not going to tell us what you thought of ALL the Kung Fu Panda movies I see how it is lol
Rayan should do a vid like this: I tested 5 star hotels or anything but I have to leave a honest 1 star review.
Ima make a long thingy                                 Wait                                  You’re still here?

9:56 - looks like it came straight out of the Backrooms😅😅
love your content! you make my day or night or anything so much better and always manage to put a smile on my face!…..Five Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Leaving 5 stars is already lying
1 star places are improving themselves in hopes ryan will give them justice.
Uhm second hotel shinning vibes

Panda 😂
YOU SHOULD DO AN EPISODE WHERE YOU TRAVEL TO ALL OF THE HAUNTED HOTELS! 👻
Ya ya yA
Bro brought a stud finder😂
Try Rochester Motel, Indiana
Stayed at the magnolia while in for my son's baseball tournament a couple years back and it's an amazing hotel!
Tbh would love to see a ghost series with you hahaa
Joyride candy was in my local store
Ryan useing an stud detector to find ghost: 18:36
bro really showed that toilet picture while im eating watching this
Every like I get on this comment I will sleep for 1 more minute 😜
I love how he's using a stud finder to find ghosts
Did anyone notice how he used a stud finder in the haunted room?
20:03
I saw Joyride strips at a Marshall’s checkout lane…is that supposed to be there already?
Ryan using the stud detector😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉😂😂🎉🎉😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
I love it when he rates it 5/5 and commented about his pajamas and jammy time lol
Ryan should go to the Cecil Hotel. Creepy Stuff there.
Yo Ryan can you please give me a shout out in a video I have watch u for 4 years. I love your content. And me and my dad watch u. And Spock and Hailey are the best. Ps keep up the great content _colin
So do you just set up your camera on a tripod and walk away from it for those walking clips?😂  That would stress me out that someone is gonna snatch it and run
Order coming soon
Room 2004 is nice geeze
I live in abq and have passed by this hotel my whole life. never thought people actually would say there. recommend many way better ones literally down the street

Baby gril
the security guard is me when someone asks me where the teacher is during homeroom LIKE DO U THINK I KNOW???
Ryan sleep talking 😂🤣
It’s like he knew I got on YouTube for a good video
Kinda looks like there’s eyes 19:58
In Virginia I almost stayed at the mulberry inn hotel while on vacation go to the hotel next to it cause it closed down
Ryan is basically a normal person only he is a YouTuber and is basically showing life.
Now you have to go to 5 star hotels and give them a 1 star rating
Ryan is never home

I'm from Lincoln NE and I'm glad people are finally showing that Nebraska is more than cornfields (it is about 94% farming fields but you know Lincoln and Omaha are cool)
Ryan, that's a stud finder
you should do trying 5 star hotels but i have to leave a 1 star review
The bullet hole in the door of the first hotel/motel came from the inside of the room so that would be kinda concerning
Those accents 😂❤
JAMMY TIME
Let be honest RYAN. YOU DA MVP FOR ALL OF US... wait what happened to the tv?
Yo, John M. I’m eating here😂😂😂😂
Clean your tickets before this YouTuber has the most subscribers in the world  👇
You should make sour gummy worms
You should watch kung fu panda series too
Jeff
That better than my WiFi
You should make this a series          No pressure
Deal
“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011” “I’m out of sour strips” 😭😭😭 ngl pretty scury
Go to the happy journey in Utica NY
I've figured it out! When the front desk said enjoy your stay the lady must have said " you too" so they were breaking in to enjoy their stay
What happened to buying spock a toy?      Get him one
Hi

12:12 bruh
Bud went to my home city and i was at the mall😢

The first thing I test is the bedding and sheets with a uv light and bed bugs
Bro hi
Can you make sour bubble gum? i would love to try it
One tip: if you get goose bumps Evan when your warm Orr not cold then that means a ghost or a spirt walked by!😊 hope it help
Imagine being someone who hasn’t watched his other videos and hearing the breast milk comment 😂😂😂
Why are the joy rides out of stock
Whoever has the most likes in the comment section is gay
I tried your candy it is good
Ryan, you already did the second hotel
3:25 in the burn on the desk is more then likely from someone cooking drugs in a spoon and the soot from the bottom staining the desk
St. Regis? That's crazy! I went to the same chain in Mumbai and it was amazing and super expensive, I mean it's a 5 star hotel, so that's shocking lol
the worst hotels… aren’t on google
15:15 you could say…skibidi toilet
My kids watch your videos all the time and your a quality dude and I appreciate how genuine you are.  Keep making content. I support you broski.

If you didn't come from Tiktok, you are allowed to like this comment.
Joy ride is gonna be in Walmart in calling it. NOW

Hotels and Motels are different though. Maybe you should buy a cheaper room to review. 😂
Oliver Tree in the Elevator?

Hi
I wonder if Vanity gave Ryan the haunted room on purpose!
I surched and this vid came up for hotel phillps
What?
The motel 6 looks like a 7
Ryan did you see my boi cory?
The front desk girl at 16:05 doesn't grasp the concept that someone can push the wrong button and it going to a floor and opening and closing by itself XD
Make part 2 to all your review videos where u travel
I stayed in one in El Paso one time and there were blood stains all over the walls and bullet holes needless to say I didn’t sleep much that night
yeah.. painting.. totally
dude in the next video please tell us where you got those jammies i have to know the fate of the world rests on this!!!
Jesus loves you
Ryan i think in upcoming videos you should treat yourself like Testing 5 star hotels The video is awesome
Nebraska on top
Tested 1-star hotels review all around the world!
It’s funny how Ryan used a thund finder for a ghost detective thing that’s not what it’s meant for lol
What was wrong with the clock twicking
I need to know what happen with the security guard at the Detroit hotel!??😂
How could the last hotel be. A one star😮
Yay, Omaha!
LOL THE HOTEL IS🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞
Why did he buy a stud finder 😂

The alarm clock in the last hotel is the same one I have
Test 5-Stars Brazilian Hotels
you should go to 5 Star Hotels and leave a 1 Star Review but you can’t lie.
rank the kung fu panda movies
Kansas City, MO is kinda dangerous so is Kansas City, KS.
I legit saw the hotel in Kansas City before💀
I'm in school and im in ꋪꄲꄲꂵ 13💀💀💀
According to my calculations there is already a blue chair in that room 🤓
@ryan HI
i feel like i just wasted my time reading that whole one star review at 22:43😭
I accept your trade >:)
No Ryan I almost died form watching  kun fu panda 4
I live in Nebraska hope you loved it in Omaha Nebraska 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😊😊
24:24 t hats bigger than my house
The last hotel room looked more like a house than a hotel
W Jack
I FREAKING LOVE OMAHA 🔥🔥🔥🔥
my dad had a meth empire in that motel 6 abq Ryan you’re lucky to be alive
lol do more but like MrBeast🎉
I wish I had a joyride snack
I LIVE IN MICHIGAN
You look like CG5
12:13 .. I would be so scared if I asked someone that in public and then they just inhale and exhale deeply😭
I feel like the last hotel knew who he was so they gave him special treatment
i lived in albuquerque, and that’s what is expected tbh
We literally got a bonus ghost busters episode, being a loyal subscriber comes with its perks 😂
Frogking529
both of these videos he came to my city🤦🏻‍♀️ ian proud of detroit rn
Wait a minute I saw adam.d on a game review such luck
You spelled Albuquerque wrong
*Deep Inhale* *Deep Exhale* That had me laughing.
Really wish you hadn’t watched kungfu panda 4… it has dark elements that even children shouldn’t be exposed to…
“New Mexico’s not that bad “ * gets shredded by cartel
14:12 😂
Ryan you can't lie!!!!!!!!!;
He should go to the best rated places
if u ever need a dobbelganger my good friend looks a LOT like you
As someone who's worked Front Desk, I'd be willing to bet money that girl working the front desk of the haunted hotel ABSOLUTELY put you in one of the haunted rooms on purpose when you mentioned the hotel being haunted and she saw one of the haunted rooms hadn't been assigned yet because I've done the same thing. Someone would mention something offhand when checking in like if there was a good view or hoping they got first floor because of their luggage and I'd immediately change their room to another unassigned one the fit the bill of what they mentioned.
the breast milk joke was so layered, if ykyk
burque is crazy
not surprised to see abq as the first one, especially one (from the sounds of it) that was probably close to the warzone 💀
I found joyride at Target
Ryan should’ve gone on shark tank for joy ride
🇹🇯🇹🇯🇹🇯
Vanity is a W
when i heard jammy time my brain went heck yea
“I almost got bitcoin in 2011” caught me off gaurd.
If he'll lie to people he loves about something as simple as the movies he's seen he'll lie about anything. Giving five star reviews when they don't really deserve it is so sinister.
Do one star reviews in Canada! 🇨🇦
I was here before
You should do a video were you go to 5 star hotels and try to leave bad reviews that have to be true
jammy time
you (jammy time)
Ryan it's a stud finder😂
Ryan is such a good guy bc when the guy was coughing Rayan went to go check on him Rayan i'll give you⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐stars👍👍
please don't die on us tyler
I live in New Mexico and it is very beautiful but it can be rough in some parts
Shark Tank is on its final season unfortunately…
Please bring Joyride to Canada Ryan.
You were like super close to me
''I'm sorry did the ghost wipe your butt'' that got me dyinggg
MORE RYAN HUNTING
STOP i've stayed at the hotel phillips! i liked it though hahaha
I'm in a hotel right now, I can now say I no longer feel safe.
Visit 5 star review hotels and leave 1 star reviews (if you do this idea pls go to Brazil São Paulo in a Friday, it’s a very good place I like it a lot because I live there) love your vids, hugs from Brazil ❤
the deep exhale  made me scared
you guys i bet the last candy is going to be peach rings...
Dude vanity at the kansas city hotel was flirting with you 🤪🤪🤪
If you want to go to a haunted hotel go to the Fister in Wisconsin. One time, a baseball team (i believe it was the cardinals) were staying there for a game and literally RAN OUT OF THEIR ROOMS IN FEAR
Go to the nugget in Fort Frances Ontario you won’t live lol
AGAIN?! wow this dude is determined
2:00 IM EATING RN it was also panda
I think at this point they all know who he is so they give him better service
13:45 MY PLACE!!
i 🫶 ryan trahan
I’m pretty sure the front desk lady purposely gave him room 511 because Ryan said he wanted to see if the hotel was haunted.
Bro sothing in the back roand
Last one is more like a house
When you were at the “haunted” one in Kansas City, the yellow device was a stud finder lol
the fact bro is using a stund finder the thang you use to find wood beams is crazy
IS THERE BREAST MILK IN THE FRIDGE? got me rolling from the US to the South Pole 🤣
RYAN YOU ARE MY BIGGEST IDOL😭 man I wish I could do stupid STUFF like you ❤
Omg, I just ate at that Ima Ramen place this weekend! Welcome back to our city ❤
joe p says security guard on a power trip wdym their suppose to protect you not kick you out like he or she is above the law.
"oh this is a stud finder." HAD ME GASPING FOR AIR
Hi Ryan
To be honest with you Ryan, all Albuquerque Hotels are like that 😂 Even the 5 star ones.
Ryan basically lives in Albuquerque now.
The face Ryan made when the security guard inhaled and exhaled LMAO
Are joyride available in the UK?
He was so excited for breast milk 😢😮
MiChIgAn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12600 STATE ROUTE 9W, Coxsackie, NY 12192 this hotel sucks maybe you could try going there and i have a review on it on yelp and its a best western
Stud finder
Vanity was actually so chill XD
Bro doing these fancy 100+ resorts. Need to come to Orlando\Kissimmee and do some $39 dollar bangers on US 192. You have no idea
The 12,100 Comment!
Lol that girl with the elevator opened ghost. Someone prob pushed random buttons for other floors or just pushed the wrong button
Albuquerque from Red Dead Redemption 2 is haunted.
As a KC native, I was surprised Hotel Phillips had such bad reviews. That place is beautiful!
she def gave you a haunted room on purpose bc you said you heard the hotel was haunted
You forgot about the black light test
I love how this dude is ALWAYS happy and Super goofy. (20:00 😂)
go to cecil hotel in LA
Can you do 5 star hotels but leave a 1 star rating but you cant lie
omaha 1 star hotels look more like a apartment or a house.
You should go to Canada someday and go to the city Saskatoon and go to Travelodge
Did anyone read the full E.R.T review?
Dont change anything man you are the best
bro you literally came only an hour away from where i live in this video 😭 i love your vids ❤
ok but lowkeeyy can u go to actual 1 star hotels not just ones with some 1 star reviews
Do a part 3
The Stud Finder gag was perfect

That’s kang loo wanda instead of kang foo panda
Hi
But i didnt accept the trade request
Plz pin me 😀
Does any of your candy have pork or gelatin?
Let's appreciate how much effort Ryan Trahan puts into his videos?
Why not just buy a cheap tech device from a thrift store to test of stuff disappears why risk losing an expensive camera?
Am i the only one who realized sam in the thumbnail?
For the price of that second hotel, you could stay in a super fancy one in South Africa 😂The price differences are scary.  I don't think my trip to the US will ever happen 🤣
"These new ones are my wrost nightmare" thats crazy though-
You asked for medium lol. Awesome  videos tho :)
The first one is in the movie fall
JAMMY TIME 🎉🎉✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️ is just so funny
shielded by the spirit of god amen 🙏🏾
Repent and trust in Jesus. He's the only way to Heaven. We've all sinned and deserve Hell. Sins like lying, lusting, etc. Repent and trust only in Jesus, and you will be saved! You can be saved because he took the punishment for our sins on himself when he died on the cross, just like someone can pay your speeding fine in court, and you get off free. Romans 3:23 John 3:16
WHY IS THE CANDY OUT OF STOCK AGAIN :(
Anyone else think Ryan should go to 5 star hotels and honestly give them a 1-star review? I feel like it’s safer and funnier 😅
Ryan X Sam & Colby
10:21 All 3 of them are true.
you should do bad airbnb's
"la ciudad se llama Duke, Nuevo Mexico el estado".  - Breaking Bad, Negro y Azul, S2 E7.
Howdy everyone! 🤠
what happened after you asked the guy for the vending machine???
#4 is not a room. It's a house!
BRO, SET THE CLOOOOOCK! 😅
More of the reviewing 1 star places they’re my fav
Walmart…. It’s definitely Walmart.
I am subscribed ❤❤❤
You should do this again, but international!!
I work next to the St. Regis and have always wondered what it looked like. Expected it to be nicer tbh.
Hahah the stud finding bit killed me
Like If you read the review by ERT
Love the southern accent in the 1-star reviews
that last room looked like an apartment!
4:41
You should test 5-star hotels next
Jammy time
If you CAME from TikTok you have the ability to like this comment (not forcing)
Roblox doors reference?
I travel alot from work and can easily say that The County Side Inn in virdin Manitoba was by far the worst, most nasty place I have every stayed
dude that second hotel’s hallways definitely was some backrooms shit its hallways looked so eery 😭🙏 (AND THE ELEVATOR…???)
2 days ago you were right next to meh!
A GUY NAMED GREG
DO NOT I MEAN NEVER GO THERE UNLESS YOU HAVE TOO ITS SOOOO BADD. PEOPLE WERE FIRING GUNS AND THE POLICE CAME
11:00 did he say “breast milk” 😕🤷‍♂️
There is four kung fu panda movies
Hi Ryan Im Ryan!
24:33 literally whole house 😭
Short Reminder For Me: Read 22:43
Hey Ryan you probably won't respond to this but if you ever go to Omaha Nebraska again you can review our zoo we are number 1 in the U.S and I can get you in with no problem and no charge
how is no one talking about the steak in the last hotel - not only was that shit RARE but it was definitely frozen. what were all of those juices on the plate 👎 terrible presentation 0/10
YAY DETROIT MICHIGAN! ;}
Can u sed me some joyride please
5:54 100 pullups a day is crazy. You'll be feeling that.
what app is he using for the reviews?
My parents kept getting these stupid things called “ULTIMATE SOUR STRIPS” from the store  And I told them if they didn’t buy joyride I would be mad, so they got some.
if you watched the first video like this comment
Honor to have you In my town Kansas City 🤍
Ryan ur litterly the most awkward and funny youtuber i know😭
This is awesome as a frequent traveler pretty exclusively a Marriott stayer I’m a big reviewer reader and writer I got a kick out of this.   Plus you remind me of my son who is also very funny
Imagine there's a dead body in the bathroom.
I’ve been to the Kansas City hotel. It was kinda creepy ngl 💀
Welcome to my hometown and current residence; Omaha
This video is AWESOME
1:49 That means staff are stealing things as well
Dude, ask me. I want to do this stuff. I WANT TO MEET YOU SO BAD. Dude, also try the Lincoln Ridge Hotel in Indiana, seems like most of the reviews are one star. One review even days they saw a rat in their hotel room. If you do, look at Joshua Kuras.
Is it haunted ?  " IT SURE ISSSS 🥰😀 !   Lil too excited about that lmao
Do not go in room 1408 bet no one will know that reference
God I eat up these hotel videos
The next candy is a peach ring and they are in the store REI
go on with joyride
YALL DONT EVER STAY AT ANY MOTEL SIX….. I ALMOST GOT SHOT THERE. THERE IS ALWAYS BLOOD AT ANY OF THEK I GO TO SO DONT
Congrats on #9 Trending !! 🎉
as of watching 10:33 it is actually 4:32 in my time
Ryan even if you never see this in my opinion this is the best YouTube series ever posted. Just mad entertaining. Never stop this series love you ryan❤❤
Like if your name is also diego
THANKYOU RYAN YOU HAVE BEEN HELPING ME GET THROUGH PAIN AFTER MY SURGERY AND YOU KEEP CHEERING ME UP THANKS

I feel like I watched this video in 5 minutes wtf (not an insult btw）
3:38 guys if you’re checking for bed bugs don’t just look at the sheets, look at the corners of the mattress itself :(
can you please  try nefes urla turkey,izmir,urla
I think I have been here before
19:14
Hell na that person is a backrooms entity 12:16
22:43 this review is 30 lines long! Bro wrote an entire essay
Pro tip: knock the hotel room door at least 3 times before going in
Hey Ryan! I work at Panda, it u stop by sometime ill give you free food🤣
This video is from two days ago so check the date of my comment and you can see exactly what day he filmed this video
Bro enter the Detroit back rooms 10:50
Ok but can i really go and find your reviews? Would be   interesting
3:48 You still believe in that??? (No offense)
Its crazy that 3 of the places in this video, are the same places from the "I tested one-star drive-thrus." Good job
reviewers like you are the reason we have to check the validity of reviews. (joke, this was a fun video!)
Ki
the 4th one is bigger then my own house
13:32 looks like a movie
A like ants
The desk lady at the Kansas City haunted hotel seemed like such a sweetie, I love her enthusiasm 😭😭
😂
You should go to motel 6 in Hamilton Alabama cause I had an fun last time and we had to leave due to bed bugs 😅
my gf fell asleep watching this video 😃   update: she did not  5 stars
OMAHA MVP BABY, LETS GOO!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Hi Ryan
as soon as i looked up hotel philips it said room 511 which i was looking up
Bro entered the backrooms at 9:56
Tomorrow is my birthday🎉🎉🎉
27:19 thats not medium, nor medium rare... thats blue rare sir
Ryan sell your joyride candy in Canada I would love to try them👍
Johnni spil wreckfest igen!! btw dit hår sidder perfekt idag  og jeg elsker dine podcast (lav lige introen på weekend med Johnni Gade bedre og outro) og du skal freestyle rap hvert afsnit i swig
Ryan sell your joyride candy in Canada I would love to try them👍
take joyride to shark tank!
I saw you when i was driving i live in ABQ
He went to Omaha let’s go
But it was fun
i love the music that you have in your videos
this guys the is great he doesnt get treated like a celebrity he treats others like celebritys
Fun fact: the motel 6 in ABQ was where Hank from breaking bad got a hooker for Walt Jr.
Test some of the worlds scariest places or hotels
Okay I’m feeling a little attacked 🤣
I think I know the joyride lore... he mentioned "I love shark tank, I wish I was in shark tank one day" and not too long after that near the end of the video he mentioned "Joyride is getting retailed but I can't say by who" so if my wild guess is right I think Ryan's joyride is getting retailed by shark tank (im so smart arent i)
whose haunting the toliet hanako
ryan trahan reminds me so much of rekrap2
It's mega bits not bites it's 8* difference
I can't believe he really called a studfinder ghost equipment.
“It sure is!”😃🥳
Go to red carpet inn Dumfries Virginia
* 1 star *
He should of gone to the Baymont by Wyndham in Panama City Beach if he wanted to go to an actually horrible hotel. 2.8 stars on google.
The ghosts like "Nah he chill."
Ryan is such a dedicated businessman he dreams about joyride
I'm loving these low-star series 🙏🙏🙏
Ayo Ryan I would like to invite you to do some content in Thailand. #😰
Danmmmmm the last one tho it's 4s not  1s?
Kansas City! Awesome my city made the list! I am from Kansas City!
I read every word on the review at 22:43 lets js say, he lost 200$ and isnt happy about it
The deeep exhale is so funny bro is done with that question

The only downfall about your videos is once I start watching them. I can’t stop for hours. 🤦🏼‍♂️
lesson learned: if ryan walks into the hotel you work at, book it. find another job
Vanity is so sweet ❤
I was actually stayed at the motel 6 visiting my father when I was a kid. We passed a room when the door was open. The stretch was concerning didn’t want to know where it was coming from in that room.
W vid ryan you posting is the highlight of my day ✨️ ❤
Can you say hi to my best friend from new Mexico
You looked like Tom holland for a sec
Great vid as always
16:32  I heard the genuine fear and dread in his voice when he said "There's no way..."
15:01 this is the best joke I’ve ever heard 😂🔥
i love that Ryan's pyjamas are litch perfect for having milk and cookies
GOATTTT
YOU WERE IN DETROIT?????

The girl from the desk at #3 100% knew who he was😂
A ST Regis? Wth are they thinking?
nah man at this point I dont feel bad abt u having to stay at bad hotels, I feel bad for ur bank account bc of all the traveling😭
Once I was in a hotel in Romania, there was leftover food ON THE BED and unflushed poop in the bathroom..
A colab with Sam and Colby would be one of the most entertaining video EVER
part 3 pls 😂
NO BREAST MILK!
❤️JAMMY TIME IS THE BEST PLZ SHOW IT IN OTHER VIDS ❤
Megabits, not megabytes.
Ryan should’ve brought ouija board to the haunted hotel lol.
hey ryan can you put the ACTUAL reviews on there instead of made up ones i mean it just sounds like you made them up because they have some similarity in writing
Bro that kungfu panda looks terrifying
Wait wait wait why did no one notice that hotel one is close to hotel 3 but still he go to the borders in hotel 2
Omg I literally walked past u when u we’re in Detroit but I was afraid it wasn’t u so I didn’t go up to u and now I am sad that I missed that opportunity
Rutland, Vermont, Cortina Inn on Holiday Road. Good luck.
15:42 “it sure isssss” “Ohhh😗” LMFAOOO
Ryan, gosts is not a christian thing. Come on now, God on top not youtube
Panda 29:02
Love your content But just the windscreen on your microphone needs washing
What 6:06
Always a good day when Ryan posts
There's a beyond horrible motel 6 in Las Vegas, new Mexico.

First hotel low key loks like the one from better call saul one of the last 2 seasons.?
make the candy halal in dubai plssssss
i have stayed at the one in abq there before and there was beer in the fridge it was cool
When he said the weird painting has juice stains on it that’s how it was made though😂
Weird juice stains lol its part of the painting funny ryan 😅😅😅🎉
As someone from Albuquerque, the moment you went there the problem wasn’t even going to be the hotel, it’s just our city 😭😂
That website was so nice. Can’t have shit in Detroit. 😔
Try out hotel cicel 😅
Did you ever find David
I almost bought bitcoin in 2011
Lol I love how Ryan has absolutely no shame 🤣🤣 hotel lobby in pajamas
Hey
Bro can wright 69 I survived books😂
Banger
Love the jammy
My grandpa’s bro lives in Detroit,MI
Go to the Cecil hotel.
Honestly if you just fart all night, the ghosts will leave you alone.
culos
I feel like you went earlier and stole Davids device just so you could have a device to test if it would be stolen
Gta mission 😂
i stayed in the Detroit hotel and i saw a camera coming from under my door
the 4th movie is trash
that first hotel was really western...
JAMMY TIME 🔥
Stud finder for ghosts xD
Albuquerque mentioned 😎
PLEASE do one of those videos where u go around and check for hidden cameras in hotel rooms there have been some crazy exposés showing like 20+ cameras shaped like an alarm clock, fire alarm etc! So scary
So you’re gonna do 36,500 pull-ups in one year 5:49
GB Glace
W
ryan trahan x sam & colby????
Pls never go to the cecil tho
Why do you do this to your life?…
toilet was haunted 💀
Ryan, please learn how to actually check for bed bugs! Look in the crevices of the corners of the bed! Great video as always.
please start posting 2 times a week
W vanity
When he received the food and sat down I saw a dog like black figure behind him
nothing soothes the soul more than ryan in one-star hotels
I love Ryan Trahan. He is the most joyful and nice YouTuber. He deserves 20 mil subs
Im jealous because your eating my baby steak is my bbg not you
So I'm an admissions rep and have been going to hotels in small towns and brother when I tell you don't do that, I mean it. Everything smells like a pool. Do not stay at a quality inn in a small town in Iowa trusss
not all of the hotels are 1 star
14:03
No way bro actually got put in 511
the sound effect you use is from the super nintendo dixie kong game, tell me I'm wrong
Is it weird to leave a 5 star review for this video?
It is ✨JAMMY TIME✨
12:13 i’m crying
I live in nz
Did he cross the road and then have to come back for the camera? 15:26
its such a youtuber thing to just drive around the country to stay 1 night at hotels, not to visit the actual places
Omg I live in omaha  Nebraska 22:13 !! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS, WISH I COULD HAVE MET YOUU. 5 stars 👍🏾
16:14 the lady here is genuinely so cool!
Your videos make me happy
Ryan, do you participate in Christianity? I am one myself and would love to know based on some things I’ve seen in your videos.
0:46 yes it was Bender Bending Rodriguez
I would never go there so gross 😅😅
Thank you ryan for putting ur life at risk just to entertain us 😂
That's CRAZY that a St Regis looks like that
3:42  if you know what could that be you know
Bro tried using a stud finder to bust ghosts😂😂😂
pls release joyride in tesco asda ect so british people wont feel left out
"i tested haunted hotels"
Love to see ppl visiting Det even if it is for the worst hotel 😂
@6:03 the bathroom door had most definitely been kicked in lol
Is joyride coming to other countries?
Come in Romania!
ryan did you launch your lolipops cause i found some at tjmax did you release em or not please tell me ._.
That TV in the first motel is pretty nice for hotel standards
Fun fact: Ryan almost bought Bitcoin in   2011
Which app is used for the reviews
Hey Ryan, i was wondering if you ever tried lucid dreaming and if you didnt can you make a video on it?
This is the guy has no enemies
Why did he say that room 2004 wasn’t his room?
u suck
“I’m sorry did a ghost wipe your butt” got me dying 😂
Shout me out  Ryan pls
When you said "KC, MO" I was like "please not the sheraton"
noice
That steak looked fire
27:01 this right here deserved it's own laugh track
Am i the only one that was looking for Ryans review
CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOUR CANDY IS AT STORES
Bruh im not from america
People who want joyride in UK can like this
Please ship these candy’s to Brazil,I BEG YOU RYAN
@Kaylee Foster
00:35 did @Peet Montzingo didnt sleep there on his roadtrip?
Kaylee foster is my cousin seriously
So you don’t actually leave reviews, that’s sad.
Didn’t think this video was going to turn spooky for lil bit 😂 you should collab with Sam and Colby, I think you would have a cool time.
I stay in Detroit every couple months for a week or so and that hotel ain't are 1 star hotels not even close 7 mile on down are true 1 star. Also do flint next that's my home city I feel like are hotels way more ratchet.
I think I'm the best rater because I rate this video 5 stars.
Joyride in Canada please??
go to cecil hotel or noob
please do more, i literally love these vids, been binge watching them all week
johhnie guilbert was in the first motel of the video lol
black futons  THOSES ARENT FUTONS
Good video
The stud finder killed me 😂
JAMMY TIME
I need to know what that security guard said 💀
I hope that I could buy JoyRide but J can’t cause I live in Turkey
Reply ok
the way my heart SANK on the final room. i saw the stairs and i was shocked. when you came out of the door i thought it was terrifying but what the hell did i just witness. STAIRS IN A HOTEL? I AM NEVER GOING TO A NORMAL HOTEL AGAIN.
Ryan, you have to flip the mattress to check for bed bugs. Also the bed frame as well.
i Definantly saw some joy rides in a PX at Fort Leonard Wood same logo and everything test market?
So when we were coming back from Florida at night to Vrigina we stopped by a hotel no body was in there it looked abandoned but the lights are still on I was creepy the hotel was call “relax inn” how are We supposed to relax if it smells like cow poop 🤮🤮
bet you don't have the balls to go to the Doors Hotel
First video YT suggested & thought what the heck, the title sounds interesting... Instant crush on Ryan 😍 How is he this adorable?? He's funny as hell too!! Just wanna put him in my pocket and take him everywhere with me lol Will definitely watch more of his videos!!
The Stud Finder😂
BRO RYAN LITTERALLY RIGHT NEXT DOOR thats crazy
I also watched all of the Kung Fu Pandas in 2 days.
If you open your mouth over the speaker you kind of sounds like phone guy from fnaf 1
why did he get a stud finder im dying
This guy is so wholesome
YOU WAS IN KANSAS CITY OMGGGGGGGGGGG
YOU CAME TO KC
4:06, A man in Albuquerque New Mexico coughing? Unless you are looking to break bad, I would not recommend interacting with this man.
If you bring the talking stick to these hotels you don’t have to worry
you should do 5 star hotels but you have to leave a 1 star review
9:42 😂😂
me want joyride but it sold out so me don't use grammer
Jammy time
bro wtf is this comment section bot central??
Please can you make joyride in England?
Here is a challenge: Please get your sourstrips into Checkers, South Africa. 🎉
You didn't test 1 star hotels, only one had one star, the rest was three stars.
ryan i hate to say it but you are falling off
AGAIN!?
Love your videos ryan !
That sigh from the security card was SO LOUD. I don’t know how you stay so positive in places that would give me such anxiety.
Go to the tower crieff scotland
Rayan: I orded a medium rare... Me looking back at the recording: 💀
This vid is so so so so so so so Interesting 🤔
Sigma
What was your favorite kung fu panda movie?
i ran out of content …. again
Rayan we need 00.1$chalenge this summerpls
You could go to shark tank for your candy company
Wait… i bought your candy at Harris Teeter last week! and none of them were sour strips
The ghost hunting part really got me shocked I did not expect it
took me a whole minute to realize you were in the room and weren't scared on the last one 😭
Yo Ryan I need more of these videos
The fact that you said my name Rebecca ! I’m dead !😊😅
I’ve been going through a pretty rough patch in my life lately but just watching your videos always seem to cheer me up for a little while . Love your videos man, appreciate everything you do ❤
My comment has zero likes😂
Ryan Trackhan has really run out of ideas
Hi
17:07 U got a vacuum with you (ghosts weaknesses)
I thought you said 1 star not 2 star… Edit: idk errr I just wanna comment
13:22
could you doa format like this, but a person has to choose a hotel for you, and you guess, howe the rewiew is
11:42 Funny thing is, in Sweden that kind of static is called "the war of the ants" (myrornas krig). So they most def was inside the TV
10:29 the 3rd 1 is a lie
❤❤❤❤🔥
go to cecil hotel
Try haunted hotels
The Kung Fu Panda trilogy is incredible but the fourth one is sooooooo mid
HE WENT TO MISSOURI?!?!
"bonus peephole" im dying hahahahha
Have you done St. Louis MO?
6:01 the internent looks a bit trash
publix gang for sour strips
Dont lie, kung fu panda 4 was mediocre at best.
Are you okay ?😢ryan
I am like 99% sure the fence at 00:45 is out of a daily dose of internet video, an alligator went through it
Did the bus say Rebecca on it 💀
Sitting down and eating popcorn while watchong your videos is like the most enjoyable thing for me. Keep making amazing videos❤
5:45 Suggestion: Instead of “Jammy Time,” being used here, its a great place to put in “Joyride Ryan Trahan Candy Plug.”   -Hotel management might of been trying to break into the room due to: Noise Complaint, Emergency, or Criminal activity/other issues  24:08 Be careful on those stairs, steep and looks creepy.
Ups truck 😂
can you test the best hotels? it would be a change of pace lol
You literally found the backrooms in the second hotel, that's insane.
Im the 11,636 comment and the 4,672,046m viewer
oh god not again
the "fires" are crackheads lol
YEEEHAWW
For hotel 16:34 it’s defo part of the reputation to bring more tourists in
🤓🍿
What shows? Cuz ive never seen THAT device before.
We know
If you are reading this Ryan most of the E.R.T review wasn't really talking about the hotel.
I think he has a bootleg kung fu panda plushie but idk
try hotel cecil
I COULDVE MET YOU!😭😭 OMAHA NE IS CRAZY
Only people watching this video right NOW can kiss my ass.
Did you see the the eclipse?
22:44  Uhhhhhhh Yhea  nah i cant be bothered 😂😂😂😂
PENNY
t minus zero
Hi can join pin me me
I live in Novi Michigan Thats funny for you to go to Detroit Michigan 😂
no way u went to ima in midtown detroit that’s my favorite spot!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ryan should do a ghost hunting video
Don't watch the KUNG FU PANDA 4, it's just a money grab and it will ruin the franchise for you
I live in Detroit I'm so mad I went to the hotel the day you posted the video
Ryan is better than mrbeast. Buying 200M stuff is a bit overrated. Ryan does 1 star reviews. *5 stars*
visit georgia the country
I've seen all 3 con fu panda movies I might watch con fu panda 4 tonight
22:44  I’m sorry but if two $200 charges overdrafts a business account,  I feel like you really have other issues than just a hotel you stayed at
i usually never write comments but this video made me right one because its the first time i watch a 30 minute video without getting bored and actually enjoy it. keep up the good content ryan
YO YOU WERE IN MY CITY AND I DIDNT SEE YOU 😭😭
I so sure that the second hotel is a money laundering business.  Nice building, Lobby and lounge area but 0 efforts in the details and other aspects
When is joyride coming to canada
W❤
When would joyride be launched on india? I can't  wait to try it out!
Try the cove motel Hamilton ohio worst ive ever seen no way you leave a good review...
11:03 breast milk????
I seen gummy worms that were sour and sour fruit gummies at the store
im gonna play with my toys now 17:59 -Ryan Trahan 2024
I'm only 2 minutes in,.. someone lurking 👀 on 2nd story while Ryan is recording 😮
Days inn in Yuma az and super 8 off i10 in tucson az
11:04  my indian ass is turmarized 🙂
Ryan: Is this place haunted  Women: It sure is!
what did the security guard say was he rude?
The disappointment in his face when he sees what room he will stay in, LMFAO, I suggest that maybe you can make a contents about visiting some haunted hotels around U.S.
OMAHA!!
Another fun video!
We need a part 2 for testing 1 star hotels!! ❤❤❤❤ Like if you agree! ❤
I'm so sorry, Ryan. I saw Kung Fu Panda 4 yesterday and it was super fucking boring. it probably would've been better if you didn't watch the first 3 before seeing it cuz it cannot compare to the others at all
3:55 the bullet still there
Hi
The front desk lady being STOKED about hauntings is a vibe
Motel 6s are horrible I swear to you those rooms have every roach species you can think of I was literally scared to sleep because of how many roaches there was 💀
can’t go watch Kung Fu panda 4 without Jammys now
love these
Vanity is a name from one of those videos of cute baby names if they had different meanings 🤣
that pasta from the 3rd hotel looks fire
The second hotel. Where is the carpet?
Did you find walter with some crystal m*th at 0:21 ?
sam and colby need to explorer the hotel with you. maybe a Collab?
2mbs is bad ? that's the most you can get in iran . and every app is banned
Lol😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t translate: 斯基比迪廁所將是我的 是的，俄亥俄鎮 是的
Wondering if someone has a link to buy this legendary pull up gear
If you want Ryan to do the penny series again   👇
That jammy time transition at 17:48 was clean🔥🤌👌
22:45 time stampmfor myself
Bro best video series
Shark tank is king 👑
I love God's word and you
You know what probably happened with that first hotel? Bugs Bunny made a wrong turn at Albuquerque and from that day forward initiated a campaign to make sure everyone else felt the same way.
Best of the best youtuber
I love this type of your vidros
STRAWBERRY ROPE BITES 27:27
yo take your brand to South Africa
He sounds like will trent
You r literally my favorite youtuber it would mean a lot to me if you noticed my comment and put it in your next video pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
HE NEVER MET REBECCA IN THE THIRD HOTEL!!!!  He NEEDS !!!! to make a short talking about Rebecca and revisiting the hotel JUST to meet her
I farted
I like the haunted one because the lady who checked you in was honest
now we need 5 star rated hotels in the US.
You made this on my birth day
Hey Ryan I am your biggest fan and wanted to try joyride but it is not available in India😢
Your videos are my go to comfort videos. I always watch them before bed. My life has been depressing and difficult the last few years and  I am so grateful to have amazing people like you to help me get over these hard times. I love what you do and please keep on doing what you do best! Hope everyone is having a good day.
Your editing is so good
You should test one star BnB
9:41 💀💀💀
You should do a ghost hunt at hotel phillips with Sam and Colby that would be goated 🔥
maybe try motels next time
Its been like 4 year or something since I've watched Ryan trahan
Ryan why is your penny series song not available in Spotify
Feestables better 🗿
Be honest, you picked a motel in Kansas explicitly so that at the end of the video you could say "We're not in Kansas anymore"
I have a challenge this might take years but he watches a solar eclipse in a 1star hotel
Well done you post great videos keep up the good work
He still thinks about the breast milk😂
Ok cool but you should do the opposite and test 5 star hotels lol
Would a warm refrigerator be an oven?
Please Ryan that’s NOT how you check for bedbugs
next you do a video of staying in the most haunted hotels of the world or the US. (those of which are open)
Ooof content is running dry
Why was my favourite part of all of this seeing Ryan watch kung fu panda 😂
We stayed at that Motel 6 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Good lort, I we had that same room! 😂😮😂 The walls are paper thin!
ryan pls have Hailey in the next video :)
I was under the impression bed bugs aren't visible... you're so brave! be safe.
Can you please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️ put it in Sri Lanka please 🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️
You should do financial audit!! I think it would be soooooo cool to see you on
Never watching bros videos while eating💀👍
When Ryan posts it’s a good day
oh Vanity definetly booked you into 511 on purpose after you asked if it was haunted lol bless her
ya i think i know a worse hotel  becuse when my mom took me and my sister to kentucky to visit my moms sister when we stopped at a hotel their was a used condom in the trash can
Ryan Trajan, you are a blessing to YouTube society. Thanks for making great videos
I luv Ryan’s videos
can u try estonian hotels
Make a toothbrush
That's NOT the way you check for bedbugs. You have to look at the mattress and the seams. DUH!!!
jammy time!
Bro really said "Yeah I'm fine" when people are holding a gun behind it back and says no and leaves a 1 star review.
Omg... that exact same hotel in Albequerque you stayed at I used to drive past when my grandma drove me and my sister to her house. Nostalgia
Your mic is clipping. Check the levels of the recorded audio with Audacity.
this is such a great video!!! IM PROUD OF YOU RYAN!!!
why dont you test 1-star ubers
“The toilet is haunted. Did the ghost wipe your butt” got me rolling on the floor so hard😂😂

MAKE NEW CONTENTYDFHJJIGG
I know that the penny series has ended, but could we get a penny series just this last time because the last part for series is the best, all the series has been wholesome and fun, could we have just one last part of the series?
"i have to leave a 5 star review but i can't lie" isn't that the very definition of lying if the place is genuinely bad? Or are you using subjective optimism as a scapegoat?
Bring ur own sheets and hygienic things for motels
You should try orange chicken, and chow mein  At panda express
You should go to 5 star hotels that are cheap
please sell joyride in asia
ryan using a stud finder for "ghost equipment" got me dieing

Youre my favorite YouTuber Ryan!
"Hope i dont get a haunted room" last words from ryan
Jammy Time
His "oh" after she said "IT SURE IS!" 😂😂😂😂😂 She was too excited to check you into a haunted room.
I looked up Hotel Phillips Room 511and it said nothing abnormal other than a YT short abt this very vid
Fun fact ants could get in the tv
Hey ryn can you do a video of playing airsoft with your friends? ❤
That yellow device if for construction
You should go to the Tropicana Hotel in Alantic City NJ. because the rooms are actually so bad. the showers had mold. The only good thing is the shopping center area and restraints. The elevator ride is also very very shakey

Hej johnni
I booked that hotel in Kansas City on a Hotwire deal 3 years ago. I am very glad that I had no idea it was supposed to be haunted. Eek!
How do you leave your camera and walk away in these shady areas?
Surprised that stud finder wasn't going off constantly with Ryan holding it.      Lol, being born and raised in KCMO, and glad you keep coming here for videos. I hope to meet you around sometime! So glad you got to enjoy KFP 3 here.
20:00 was so funny lmao
Ryan's videos really are a blast! I can't imagine ever going to purposely try out a 1* something, though it would be cool to try sometimes. I guess that's just anxiety making it harder. Anyways, keep up the great vids <3
Doesn’t anyone notice that this doesn’t even mew and still has a perfect jawline
PLEEAASE PUT JOY RIDE IN AUSTRALIA
Guys is it available in australia i wanna get this really bad :(
ryan talks while sleeping🤣😂lol
Bro sleeps and wakes up shirtless
Good video

That Motel 6 was totally like what foreigners see in their minds see when they hear about American motels.
Social anxiety is scared of Ryan.
bro straight up telling his fans to leave more ridiculous 1 star reviews everywhere so he has an endless loop of new content to record
Do one of these videos with Haley( I think that’s ur girlfriend)
3:00 kurtlar vadisi pusu a turkish serie soundtrack come on 😂

Is anyone gonna talk about how Ryan just left his Sony fx30 or fx3 outside😭😭😭, I would’ve taken that lmao
Ryan will your candy be coming to coles or Woolworths in Australia?

He should do haunted hotels, not to do any investigations or anything like that but just stay there like a normal guest.
Go to Edmonton Mall
15:53 vanity deserves a raise

I stayed at that motel 6! Met a guy named Jesse pinkman. Cool guy great crystal
Room is not existing
Ryan is trying to get caught lacking 💯🔥🔥🙏
Bro bought a stud finder for ghosts😂
after this video we have to get ryan to collab with sam and colby
16:00 ryan was making sure he wasnt talking to rebecca lmao
I am came from YouTube recommended
18:33 i heard a gasp
Def should do a ghost hunting with @twin paranormal
vanity honestly seemed like a really cool worker
Bro literally said nothing about kung fu panda 2...
y is chess strats on the chalk board? Is ryan becoming a megaming? Is this a hint at thee next joyride? We may never know.
I like cacey is fine with dem cockroach
those who took 10:14 a little different '' why is it making those noises''
if you do this again bring a black light so you know what your touching and laying in some hotels are Dirty periot
The Kung Fu Panda is Atrocious😭😭
Hi😊
I feel like that "Sharktank" clip is a preview on a future video, "I negotiated in Shark Tank"
😅😅😅😅😅😅
Can we just appreciate his humor😂❤
Paul v is my math teacher. looks like him and same name
Great video Ryan. Luv ya!
😎😎😎
the st. regis is giving the shining
Question, does Ryan actually post the reviews? Cause I've checked some of the places he has been to but I haven't seen any of his so far.
I LIVE IN ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO
Megabit not megabyte

You should do this in Australia
An REI near me already has joyride candy and has for a while I was surprised but also thought it was super cool. 5 stars
Hotel number 2 is for curious gorge I don’t know how to spell it
we love it jeff
St Regis hotel is a woodward ave staple. Too bad your experience wasnt the greatest.
Ryan's videos are so fun and calming to watch after a busy day
nah that last hotel isn't a hotel its a (air bmb
2Mbps would be 2 megabits, not megabytes (MB) Just saying
go to the cecil hotel in LA and go explore all the water tanks
17:46 toooooo smooooooth
Vanity deffo needs a raise she was so nice 😊
Bro casually leaves his $1500 camera in the hallway on purpose
The stud finder 😂
Ryan do penny challenge in asia
Can you do one where you review only luxury diamond hotels?
I almost bought bitcoin in 2011 kills me🤣🤣
9:05 Listen to the woman at the front desk "I'm pretty, how are you?"
I get 2mbps on a good day...
I am from ABQ and I can say that there are hotels like 10 times worse than that motel 6 in ABQ if you want a sketchy one go to the Motel 1
you really need to stop going to places with bed bugs it’s so serious
I think the omaha hotel KNEW it was ryan. Lol no way you fet a 2 story room.
Sub please
Can u please try 1 star movie theaters
I don't know if the part when he said he ran out of sour strips was a advertizment or not
THE GREAT RESET
2nd one seems like it deserved the low star reviews tho.
“ Spock got into the trash again”
oh my god hanako is here
12:11 😂😂😂😂 bet they heard it so many times since that 1 review🤣🤣
The stud finder part was GREAT😂😂😂😂😂
I came from TikTok because the short video wasn't enough. I needed to know more.
It's probably all the good hardworking people who ruin everything showing up to hotels and bars because if anyone says the truth they might get canceled
I just love how every testing video you just spend a lot of money to only stay in one country for 24 hours
I have stayed in cheap nice rooms before but you can't find them anymore the drug addicts all stay there now so I just stay at jw Marriott now
Stay safe
ws jack
coming to KC and not getting BBQ has got to be a crime
Literally been on that sidewalk in Omaha and in that toy star
Hey guys
every time mudkip was on screen 0:00-0:04 and 0:07-0:10 and 0:17-0:18
🔥
Some places you really shouldn't leave 5 stars. These hotels have been BAD.
Trade offer accepted.
When checking for bed bugs make sure you really look at the corners! They gravitate there the most!!
I WENT TO THE FIRST ABQ HOTEL WHAT
Ryan you should stay at The strater Horel in durango colorado. Its supposed to be haunted and has some silly reviews
Cool! 🆒 3:43
I Tested 1-Star Hotels (again)  Me:Clicks faster than light itself   I tested 1-Star apartments ✨if it exists✨
UPS truck! Best part
love you man, you cure my depression. keep making these banger vids.
I think he just went to 5 stars
can u make mango flavored candy? it would 100% taste good.
As someone who lives in Detroit I have never heard or seen this hotel in my life, but the Ima shout out was great. I am pretty sure that place is a spot to go into the backrooms
lol what I had a gummy bear version of joyride?!
so uhm, we bought this joyrides gummy worms from walmart, looks EXACTLY like yours, it was onsale, and my mom had some, SAID IT TASTED LIKE POISION? im not hating, im even subbed, but is this your joyrides?
I personally would have rated the last one 7 stars
17:58 wow, ryan even put in some phasmophobia music
I love me some Shark Tank 🦈 !! 💪  🙏 👏😇
i work for a delivery company and i got stuck in an elevator for an hour today and the elevator sounding janky i was scared
Ayyyyy Kansas City represent 🎉
John had to apologize to the toilet in advance 😭😂
Vanity has a crush on you I think
the staff broke in review could be about staff going into rooms when the customers aren’t there and stealing their stuff, it happened to my mom and sister at a large chain hotel, a LOT of their stuff was stolen by a worker and her boyfriend
Lori and the rest 😢
I was literally eating Panda Express as you got the DoorDash 😂😂😂
btw all ur new candies have been leaked on uk amazon for purchase
In the first hotel is that the same place where hank schrader takes wallter's son in episiode 2 season 1 of breaking bad?
U should rate 1 star jyms
ryan clean ur laptop screen 🥲
I love this vid
26:15 yea i dont think thats a panda
but why'd you lie about gettin room 511 randomly
The stud finder took me out…like I was 90%  that’s what it was before he said it… then when he clarified I about fell off the bed. I am at my grandparents so my mom and I are sharing a bed and I literally almost woke her up from laughter. Ryan, you’re one of the few people on this earth to make me laugh so hard! God bless you man! Also Amen to the power of God protecting you❤ praying for you always!
“Let’s see if there’s breast milk in the fridge” would be so confusing if you haven’t seen the previous hotel video 💀
Ryan, as someone who visits Detroit. I’m so happy you went.
Hello 😅
Ryan, bravest man I’ve ever seen. I woulda ran just at the mention of a haunted room 😂
The response the security guard did after Ryan ask where the vending machine made me laugh so hard. Bro had flashbacks of Joe.
Idk if it was just me but i actually read all of what E.R.T had to say😭
What about Kaly
511 is crazy
Come to kitimat bc, go to chalet check in then walk down spruce trail before sunset 😵‍💫👻🇨🇦
Drop the sweet fish.
How were the last three 1 star hotels?
Awesome how everyone loves how energetic the staff were about the spooky hotel lmao always love to see the traveling!
Joyride is your business?? We sell Joyride at the AMC I work at!! I can’t wait to try.

I really like these rating videos, pls make more 😊. Not rushing.
You came to kcmo, I can’t believe it! Wish I could have ran into you! 🙂
Isn't that the hotel from breaking bad????
Why does the hotel start dancing at 22:19?   EDIT: Nevermind, it was a glitch with my GPU
ryan trahan is getting boring ngl its just the same stuff over and over
I want sour strips💀
And I’m a big fan 😊
For a video can you go to Minnesota and rate the highest rated  hotel
You should come to Colombia
You should go to Clarion Inn mystic ct🤣 I went there and it was TRASH!
Me want another penny challenge
Jammy time
Is it me or did the motion detector light move a bit at 20:47. Uhhh
Best series!
Woke up, saw Ryan uploaded, immediately smil

Anazing video as always?  Future Video: “Testing Haunted Hotels”?!???? Jkjk. Kinda. 👀  Love you, Ryan!
Ok you check the corners of the beds for bed bugs.  Also look for tiny blood stains anywhere on the sheets.  The first place did look mostly clean, the holes being to due cigarette burns most likely, although there was defiant bullet holes in that place.
a collar on pajamas 💀💀
You look like Tom holland
I literally stayed in the hotel Philips hotel in room 508 from Thursday to Sunday 😂
Sam and Colby collab??
I also told all my friends I watched kungfu panda even though I didn’t
The scariest part of this entire video is "I'm out of sour strips" Yeah, I'm not sleeping tonight.
U get 4 million views in 1 day😂 i dont think u need shark tank
im gonna play with my toys now-ryan trahan 2024
🤣🙄🤷‍♀️I am not that stupid lol 😂😝😏
I don't get why you rated the sus hotel with 5 stars that vending machine took your money 😅😅😅
I am pretty sad that Ryan didn’t proceed to quickly put the stud finder on himself and then have it start beeping.
jammy time
Best and worst plane tickets-video idea
I started on the bed after that
Great video!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Ryan thank you for making my life brighter you inspire me and make me very happy keep up the great work

vanity made me so happy idk why 😭
🦶🏻
I went to a hotel yesterday they had bed bugs and we switched hotels i can give you the name if you want
Hi Ryan I love your vids and your personality but I was wondering if you sometimes think about/do something for the environment? Because you take a lot of flights and eat a lot of meat.. Maybe you could compensate a bit to watch your carbon footprint, or at least make people more aware of climate change in your vids because taking this many flights additionally to eating meat is seriously harming our planet. If our planet goes to shit we all go to shit.
The first one at the fence it could be the chunky Babay from boss baby
Why is there a Canadian flag?
Yh  511 and the other rooms are but its hella cool
Vanity was SO kind to ryan
Commenting this before i watch: i swear if you go to Montreal Canada cuz i heard them call your name at the airport in LAX
I LOVE JOYRIDE THANKS RYAN!!
5:48 That door trim is gonna bust
If you make a number 3 stay at the armani inn and suites in orangetown NY.
Walmart, Walmart, Walmart, Walmart, Walmart, Walmart
Ryan should be elite 24
Last room was clearly a set up. They knew who you were 😂
Do a ghost video with Sam and Colby
why is no one talking about the deformed kung funpanda toy
Reviewing haunted hotels would be crazy
i love you ryan as my name is also ryan
POV you live in kansas city missouri and have walked past that hotel before!!!!!!!!!!
Love you Ryan ❤❤❤❤
Out of all the rooms he got room 511💀💀💀
You should test one star review rental car locations
As someone who lives in NM Alberquerque I can say that the motel 6 there is outrageous I drove by it once and someone was but booty naked
I saw you in Disney
ALWAYS LOOK BETWEEN THE MATRESSES IN THE CREASES!!! BED BUG ARENT ALWAYS IN PLAIN SIGHT

Day 1 of asking.. Are you and Klay still friends?
Ryan would be the class clown in my class 🤡🤡🤡
Pin them a for no reason please 🥺
18:30 look at the darkness does that look like an eye?!?
Ryan, I need some sour strips. Send me some so my tastebuds can go on a joyride. 😁😂
If you want a bad hotel go to the Romeo mi hotel read the reviews they are well 😮
he needs to make gummy bears.
Taking this as an opportunity to share my only 1 star experience at the La Quinta Inn in Midvale Utah, the place stunk figuratively and literally!!! Smelled like sewers and drugs and the people there smelled bad also. The floor had trash all over it and holes and stains. Water damage in the bathroom  the table in the room was sticky. homless people everywhere outside. The fitness center was nice but the cords to the treadmill were CUT OFF I was scared to touch anything
My wifi speed is less than 1mbps
As a local Omaha native, the internet everywhere around here is pretty cheeks. We are just now getting fiber lines put down in certain part of the city.   Glad you enjoyed the area!
17:59 “I’m going to play with my toys now”💀💀💀😏😏😏
👇TEAM MISSOURI LETS GOOO🤘👍❤️‍🔥
26:16 WHO IS THAT WHAT DID THEY DO TO MY BOY PO

TOPHIA CHU MENTIONED
JOYRIDE ON SHARK TANK WHEN???
You should test 1 star reviews in other countries like Australia.
I drove by the st Regis hotel while going down south for spring break. Didn’t go in it but I thought it was just a cool fancy hotel, definitely didn’t expect Ryan to do a video in it.
bro pulled out a stud finder to hunt goasts

0:31 u see the grey car behind him is a nissian skyline which cost 950K!!!!
The next candy you make can you please make a gummy bears?

Superman broke the gate😂
Mmm yes the best ghost hunting tool, the flashlight

Ryan, hide the camera and do the standard room, i think they gave you a upgraded room due to the camera to look good
bro has never left a 1-star review in his life
you should go to the one in kansas with sam and colby, im sure it will be so fun for you
MISSOURI GANG GATHER
He used a stud ditecter to find a ghost😂
I was so nervous when he said he was going to Detroit. Some hotels in the city are so dangerous you are literally risking your life staying there.
Test five star hotels in Japan and rate them one star
Hey ryan pls release joyride in canada it would be great 😊 also is joyride halah?
Why don’t you go to the clown motel?
Who read ERT's review 👇
That was me and my girlfriend working 17:18

Ryan reply to me and my dream will be forfilled
HOTEL MANAGEMENT OPEN UP!   Me: AHHHHHH
After seeing the room in the last hotel, I couldn't help but quote Frank Grimes from The Simpsons 'Good heavens! This is a palace! 😱'
I'm gonna start a business that goes around and collects all of the cameras that Ryan leaves behind for his cinematic shots
How would your heart be for Michigan
At this point I’m convinced Ryan just has excellent vibes that immediately improve every place he stays at
Day 1 of asking Ryan for launching Joyride in India 🇮🇳
28:07 no
search up the trade up challenge where you have an item to trade and trade it for something worth more than trade that item for something worth more money you can do this with multiple items until you want to sell out  and you can do this at conventions,pawn shops,etc or you probably could start a trade convention like a flee market. So if your having no luck in the stock market or don't want all your eggs in 1 basket also I recommend raw gemstones as a secondary option and possibly learning how to cut them. You may also be able to make and trade and sell necklace pendants or mini statues out of a marble stone, sandstone,  or any kind of valuable stone look up how much marble statues go for vs sandstone vs etc and stone may store wealth for a long while but gold would still be more of a preservation of wealth because of it being not being tarnishable. And beware of this where I think everybody is failing yes it's important to have alot of value like an oz of gold that's worth 3000 but what if your trying to get something worth just 5 bucks in value it's also important to have small value items. Be aware if the system fails you gonna need something that holds as much value as a debit card and that you can physically carry around to purchase at different places which would be gemstones,stones,gold silver, but all this must fit on your person so it's important to have small value items and large value items. Paper money is already phasing out. And cyber attacks and banking accounts  being able and getting hacked is untrustworthy...the fact that digital and bank accounts are hackable by anyone in the world and the paper currency is being abolished means we have to normalize another economic system and  currency like using trade and valuable stones to buy or gain items. We do this by establishing our own local flee markets in our community or dealing out of our garages and putting up signs. And if the gov really wants to control our market they have to go against us physically with the police they are barely paying and if they do that we can get militias to guard. If the gov really wants control of everything including us by unlawful laws and military or police enforcement and want to buy into their system and overregulate us from making profit and being capable individuals we can make them fight for it they will use their over obedient fools. If everyone just got the sees out of their fridge vegetables and bought some and just threw it on land we would be repopulating the earth, if everyone started trading they would have a hard time regulating, if everyone created militias you would be that much more capable against tyranny etc literally if we all disobey the gov dont pay our taxes dont pay anybills and try ti restart from their and shift our focus on independence and honesteading that ruins their whole system and their control and things will start becoming fixed instantly by people re establishing. And the best and most proficient systems or the fittest system coming on top again. But thats already happening naturally because of the tyranny with people not being able to pay their car,phone, etc so i just have to wait. Having your own security against the police military is important we would need militias protecting our flee markets etc when we go against. As they try and regain their power. Its gonna be america and bare resemblance we would be divided into sections however large etc until once again the best system takes over so the new countrys,tribes, people are gonna try and create with new ideas hopefully better and more secure will have to be able to endure this country is on the brink of collapse going against everyone including its citizens. So i recommend start establishing a militia with capabilities with ways to gain and create food,tools, supplies then start coming up with a system of law,economic etc then start with sucessful ideas because the next countrys,settlements,tribes,milituas and founding fathers are about to happen soon the whole world system is coming apart....sbhswh

2:21 my computer crashed at the that moment :(
Ryan, when do u ship Joyride over seas, cant wait to try them, keep up the awesome work bud, big fan all the way from Sweden 😍🤞
the last room is crazy
Ryan is the OG of doing this for views meanwhile other wannabe influencers do the same cause they see the success and use it as profit
spock got into the trash again 🤣
Ryan the same with me I was 15 and the kids in my grade asked me if I watched Kung Fu Panda and I said yes BUT I didn't🤫😉. UNTIL last week my younger brother wanted me to watch Kong Fu Panda 4 so I had to stay up all night just to know what was going on (or to prove to him that I watched it😅)
Hi Ryan big fan
I live in Michigan. It’d be insane to see you in person, if it even happens.
You had to have asked for room 511
Vanity is goals
Ryan what’s your favorite ku fu panda movie
Can you Visit Poland🇵🇱?
Bro was talking to himself in hotel 3
LOVE this videos!
Glad to hear you came down to Omaha. I hope you didn’t absolutely hate the drivers here.

Does anyone know what pull ups bars he was using?
I dare you to go to my moms hotel and give it a 1 star but you have to be honest
The stud finder had me rollin…high tech device!! 😂

I read the E.R.T review and didn’t understand one word
Do Some Creative.......!!!!!!
i live in Belgium so i cant buy joyride in a store near me, except if you partner with carrefour
The haunted one literally reminded me about the hotel in AHS: Hotel 😢 but do I feel some new category coming up? Ryan testing haunted hotels? 🤔
"This hotel is not normal" *opens door and sees rush*
How does bro go on trending with in 1 day on every video
Spirit of God, and light blue pajamas!
2 questions - does Ryan ever find the 1 star thing is actually 1 star? And does Ryan actually leave a review on some website ?
Where can I buy joy ride
Idk why but i laughed when he said he was shielded by the Spirit of God
Do a collection of haunted hotels this was so funny!🤣🤣
You are my favorite  youtuber
Hey Ryan, great video! However, Kung Fu Panda 4 was a bit of a dookieburger of a film. A disservice to the entire franchise. 1 star movie, 5 star video!
Ryan? Will there be some JoyRides in the Czech Republic?💀🇨🇿
Please do a colab with Sam and coby
9:51 Bro really found the back rooms irl 💀
hey so i looked up hotel phillips room 511 (16:38) and nothing came up, like no news storys and just some random articles but nothing about it being hunted dose anyone know why?
Room 511 (الجني عتيبي)
22:43 I read it and it says they overcharge and service is awful.
14:24 I KNOW WHY
People who read E.R.T's review  👇
Hey Ryan your joyride gummies worms are 🔥
I think Ryan is just eating all the candy himself. It's always sold out. 😢
Ryan I really appreciate your videos and I am just a kid but I love watching your videos because they’re entertaining
When he waddles away so far from the camera i always fhink abt how he has to walk all the way back 😂❤ anyways hope everyone has a wonderful day
Umm 🤔
The Omaha hotel, they almost certainly set up their guest Wi-Fi 10+ years ago when they were trying to deal with the entire hotel sharing a single 250mbit connection or something where they had to throttle each user to 2mbit, and since they aren't own by a huge chain, they are clearly still on that system.
why don't you buy that baby goku from that tik tok guy
bro ryan has me scared for him😭😭
A living orgasm 💀💀
The fact that he showed us an embarrassing audio recording of him sleep talking should tell you what kind of man he is like if it was me I wouldn't have showed anyone this until I die😂
What did the toilet wipe your but for you BAHAHAHA
I live in Missouri  😮😮😊😊
I SAW YOU AT DISNEY WORLD!!!!!
your jawline is crazy
When Ryan saw that the mbps speed was LITERALLY 2mbps got me laughing.
i think ann got a bedroom that had someone do something in it
Good thing that you didn't sleep in room 13 in the thumbnail.
Next time if you do this can you bring Spock 🥺
Ryan come to lovington nm it’s not to far from abq and I would love for you be here and see how it is living in this tiny of a town
I couldn't stop laughing, you're hilarious😂 love your videos🐔

The fact that Kung Fu panda is still loading 😂❤
21:06 That was RYAN
IT SURE ISSSSSSS
He didn’t judge it against a five star hotel he judged it against other motel 6s and even kept his sample size to ABQ lol
St regis is the equivalent of a ritz Carlton or Fairmont
can't have sh!te in Michigan 12:21
PLS sell joyride in Brazil
27:58 bud got so much blood from the steak
18:51 It's just somethig that measures the electricity in the walls. If theres a wire, it will flash and beep.
Absolutely love your videos! Keep up the great work!
Ya hotel vid :D
As someone who lives near Omaha NE, it’s just awesome going and walking around downtown, awesome stores as well.
Of course most of them are in Detroit
Whenever I look at the comments of Ryan’s videos, I always think of his notifications blowing up lol
My favorite hotel reviewer.
22:42 nope
I’m still waiting to see what the security guard said😂😂😂
11:03 bro really said “Lets see if theres breast milk in the fridge“💀💀💀💀
the joyride candy is quite yummy cant wait to try new flavors
Why are all the one-star reviews in new mexico😭
Your mic sucks.
16:28 meme potential

Ryan can u review one star gyms
0:45 mr incredibles out again 4:28 who let the fly in
$35 is alot. I've had airbnbs in the $30-40 range that were better than that first hotel. One of them had 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and was super nice for under $50
Oh my goodness I LOVE THESE VIDEOS!! 😍😍😍✨✨✨
will the hotels owner comment anything when they watch your video 😅
His face when the lady said: ‘ it Sure isss.😂
I love the music that was playing on the plane ride. It relaxes your, and then the testing-1-star-reviews music comes up and suddenly it goes from relaxing to nervous.
Its always Jammy Time somewhere
the video when hotel phillips came literally hacked my tv its haunted it literally went into static
The front desk lady being STOKED about hauntings is a vibe
I love kung fu panda
Ryan I love your videos. When are you gonna do another penny challenge. I loved it so much. If you do pls can you start one in England
this guy is genuinely just simple and the best
great vid ryan you never struggle to make me laugh 😂
Coming Trinidad and tobago
29:18 I see what he did there 😂
Go to Scandic hotel in Norway it is a cheap but amazing hotel, most hotels have pools and every hotel has a free breakfast buffet.
is joyride comming to uk
You should rate 1-star air bnbs
how tf can you feature a 4 star hotel in a 1 star hotel video
22:43  she spent more time on that review then in the hotel 😭
You almost made me blind with the light
Ryan!!!! You should try haunted hotels, cecil, faust, etc. love your videos bro (my mom does too, I think she has a crush on you)
wHO ELSE DID THE uHHH SOUND ON THE RATING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bro whoever pulled that fence apart must work out literally 24/7/365

Ryan you never disappoint your videos are so funny I love the 1 star hotel review videos. Your videos are just the best and so entertaining. 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

the stud finder had me rolling. i got up and told my partner about how ryan did a funny
Should've went to the breaking bad house
There was already joyride gummy worms in my local walmart like 2 weeks ago?
visit and review haunted hotels <3
Really hope you keep protection when you do stuff like this. You went to some potentially dangerous places.
There is a St. Regis in Bombay/Mumbai in India and it might be arguably the best hotel in India
yes
The stud finder is my favorite thing ever😂
you're so pretty, you need to get on estrogen like right now. it's your duty
As an artist thathas had to stay in small rooms before, can confirm I have painted in bed before. I do have some random paintstains on some of my blankets.
Doors the hotel
20:15 you should have Luigi board at 3
Just to let you know I was once in an airport in Pisa, Italy and I seen a guy like you, if it wasn’t you you got a clone 100% I was hesitant to ask him so I didn’t 😂
U gotta do more
How to drive past one of these photos and I’ve gone in one
There's no way that all these 1 star places deserve 5 star make it make sense e
Nah, bro actually found the backrooms 💀
26:12 there is an Agumon! I have never seen a digimon plushie in a store before❤
happy 4/13 ryan
This comment won’t get up to 0 likes
search up the trade up challenge where you have an item to trade and trade it for something worth more than trade that item for something worth more money you can do this with multiple items until you want to sell out  and you can do this at conventions,pawn shops,etc or you probably could start a trade convention like a flee market...bhh
Ryan, you know when you reveal your 4 new candies, you should make a 5th Shark themed one and bring Joyride to "The Sharks" at Shark Tank.
9:57 Bro found the backrooms
Bro when he kept calling the room 5/11 it sounded like 9/11
what is ppl doing rong i just saw a kid with 116mil subs

I tink you and Sam and Colby ar ganne be rlly good frends
Why always the rule is that you have to leave a five star review but you can’t lie
My internet is 0.56 Mbps lol
Idk if I can trust anything u say after saying Kung-Fu panda 4 was fire
Blub being mewing

The nicest hotel i've ever been in had roaches in it because it had flooded a year before (it was right on the beach in the Philippines)
The Security Guard was done with the Vending Machines questions LMAO
dont sleep in room 13 at 0.00 (because of dread)
Kung Fu panda 4 was disappointing but how dare you lie about Kung Fu Panda? Hope you liked them
KCMO gang rise up
First  1:Leave five star review  2:someone has super strength at motel 6
RYAN I WATCHED THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN THE DARK AND THE WHISPER SCARED ME
If I stayed in room 511, I'd use my Christian faith and say, "Get out of my room in Jesus' name!" They have to flee in his name! Honestly, in any room, id do that.
bro brought a stud finder to find ghosts😂
Do y’all realize just how crazy it is that he just happened to get room 511
It’s jelly bears that’s the last one
Ryan season is back baby
I’d take ghosts over cockroaches any day

I’m from Southern NM, so I don’t know Albuquerque super well. But for some reason, as soon as I read the title of the video, I knew immediately that Albuquerque would be on this list somehow.
YES, THANK YOU, I SHED A TEAR WHENEVER I SAW THAT YOU RELEASED THIS MASTERPIECE.
Hi😊
Vanity deserves a raise!

Im surprised that your camera didn't get stolen when taking some of the clips 😂
Dude, that’s a stud finder. No ghost hunter would use that.  I’m a professional ghost hunter. Come back to Hotel Phillips and hunt ghosts with me!
RYAN SLAYS!
I liked my own comment
Vanity seemed so nice and kind☺️
the bullet holes in the first one are from heisnberg
20:52 I almost bought bitcoin in 2011
You should make a banana flavored candy
You should lower the price on the joyride to $10 dollars so that more people can afford it and enjoy it and you’ll get A lot more  profit pleas and I’m a big fan of your videos.
U should test 1 star casinos
please import sour strips to india ❤Big Fan From India
Uh guys that's not a ghost finder that's a stud finder.

Ryan what wrong with your underwear
We need snc up in here for the Phillips hotel 😂😂😂(idk how to spell it mb yall<3)
ryan i think you definitely need those UV lights to check out those beds
Dude, you visited Missouri I live in Missouri wish I knew that when this came out😂
At this point I'm just surprised when he says anything negative about anything, I've come to expect that every Ryan video will be positivity all the way through and turn my heart into rainbows and marshmallows... which is not something a heart should be. Those things don't pump blood very effectively.  No but honestly, I normally hate this amount of positivity, but he makes it work! Jammy time for life.
how does he get so many views?  his voice and diction are so annoying.
is joy ridegoing to be in canada?
I would probably describe the 2nd hotel as W E I R D C O R E L I M I N A L I V E B E E N H E R E B E F O R E V I B E S
Ryan please help me 🇮🇳🥺 please give reply
I live in Michigan
That is the USA not America dum dum
Jammy Time😎
You should do a visiting haunted hotel video :)
Bro forgot he ordered medium and not medium rare
Ryan - I *need* you to review the competing Motel 6s directly across the street from each other in Billings, Montana. I booked the one with 2.8 stars once and turned around before I ever made it inside. Would love to hear your take on which one is superior 😅
Now I know about this hotel in Omaha I live about 2hours away in grand island
22:43... bruuh
Bro that's the hotel bro I thought it was a lobby
KUN FU PANDAAAAA 4
Hey Ryan when are you gonna start to ship internationally?

16:49, why did the exit door open 😭 am I going insane
How are Americans even alive?
RYAN +CORYXKENSHIN COLLAB
Best accent ever
Test 1 star countries next
Legends that read the long ass report😂😂😅
I liked my own comment scince no one will.  Yes I liked my own comment.
omg you should've set up a meet & greet, next video idea you should explore more in Albuquerque. There's lots of things to do, other than staying at the worst motel 6 ever. 😂 I hope you enjoyed your stay in Albuquerque, NM.
One of my teachers name is Ryan trahey
Ryan talking while sleeping was probably one of the funniest parts in the video😅
i guess we will never know what happens when u ask abt the vending machine, ryan just skipped that part just to give 5 stars for the video title...
that bit about bitcoin (pun intended) makes ryan my new favorite ghost
I saw joy ride in the movie theaters
Ryan I promise I’m subbed
ryan is joyride gonna be in uk?
Thanks for all that u do for the younger generation. YOUR A HERO🌎🇺🇸
I NEED MORE OF THESE KIND OF VIDEOS FROM YOU 😭😭😭😞

Joy ride sucks
Ive seen you eat chicken and rice for a long time, please show us your physique
Howdy Ryan! Speaking from Greece, I want to tell you only 1 thing, if you thought 1 star hotels in America are hard to leave a 5 star review, you should come to Greece to review 1 star reviews. Low rated hotels in Greece are the final boss of the hotel videos
🇹🇯🇹🇯🇹🇯
You content is great
Lmao he just watched clips of each movie on yt 💀
WOW YOU ARE SO KIND TO GIVE 5 STARS TO BAD/GOOD PLASES
“Toilet was haunted” 5 stars

Ryan you past dr phil subs
I am addicted to your 5 star videos
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
"What brings you to Missouri" "Uh, this hotel I heard it was haunted" "Why did they give me 511" I don't know dude maybe because you said that was the reason you came lol
sam and colby ryan collab when!!

i could put sh!t all over a hotel and ryan is somehow gonna find and rate it 5 star
"Backrooms of Detroit" 💀
I thought the Motel 6 was probably the one we stayed at in Carlsbad, NM. Just as bad.
Good video bro, I enjoyed this one 👈👈
You checked if the coughing guy was ok, bless you :)
I saw Ryans candy is at Marshall’s.

Can’t you think of other ideas
are you still friends with ryan
Ryan, please make mango flavor IM BEGGING
Try 1 star airlines or movie theaters or car rentals
bro went to Oblock
I feel like i went to motel 6 or diary wimpy kid filmed there
A whole series of Ryan travelling to the most haunted hotels would be amazing!
As a resident on NM, The sunset is ALWAYS beautifu
Not again.
The first hotel looks like the brookhaven motel..
Liminal space describes that second hotel so well lol
LOL😂😂😂
bro the last hotel had 2 mbps internet?!!?i got 59 kbps internet....
Sorry I did that to the fence at the first hotel 0:44
they heard about ryan's first video and freshened up lol
You need to make a new yelp account named Tyan Rrahan to only give 1 star reviews on 5 star places
You're gonna be disappointed with Kung Fu Panda 4
His thumbnails are just getting better and better
15:40 She literally confessed about the hauntings of the hotel to a customer, not even trying to hide it 🤨😬
Bruh I found joyride in Walmart
0:45 super strength? Oh, you mean copious amounts of amphetamines?
Do the worst rated hiking trials
ryan brought a stud sensor for ghosts       like Huh?
7:05 THE PIANO THAT PLAYS IS FROM A SWEDISH SONG NAMED "KOLLA KOLLA" AND IS THE MAIN RIFF
The school bus reflecting in the back 😮‍💨
"My toilet was haunted"
Wonder if he will do hotel cecil??
Bro in room 511, that device is a stud detector! Not a ghost detecter
trahan do a yid were you go to five star hotels and give them a 1 star reveiw kind of the oppiste
I think Ryan's new job is a paranormal expert
I got gummy worm one like a couple weeks ago, did u mistakenly release that?
Bro got a 2 STOERY hotel that was the size of a house. He got a good deal

Spirits don,t carry electricity. They are made from energy.

Imagine if Ryan would go to the clown motel 😅
Um Frans, I dont think that was the hotel staff
Did any one see the f in the first hotel
Im scared for you Ryan, why do you do this to yourself 💀
When searching for bed bugs always check the corners of the bed frame and sheets
You should do Okeechobee FL flamingo hotel * I stayed there to see family * I won’t spoil anything but there is no vending and the laddie who checked me in was weird also eat at the Okeechobee air port W breakfast there
I would rate this video 10/5 stars
JAMMY TIMMME 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
His firts room was 211 and the number on the card was 9 so 9/11 coincidence i think not.
A stud finder ?
Big fan🎉🎉🎉
Also I made a spelling mistake in the last comment by accident
Ryan you're videos are good. You might very well be the next Mrbeast. Also good job you answered faze fug when he called you. Continue your with .more good videos
Pls do the penny challenge series again  👇👇👇
i find it funny every time he walking off the camera knowing he have to reurn to get the camera back every time😂

Tryan Rayhand uploaded
This guy is so effortlessly hilarious i love him
Is joyride in the UK because i’ve been looking all over for it and is it halal because if it is, then i can have it!
we need a sam and Colby collaboration with Ryan
Rayan you should do a video about you going to a 5 star hotel and you have to leave a 1 star review without lieing
You need to collab with sam and colby
That Kung fu panda toy is from OHIO😂
Ryan is the type of guy I would spend the night with in any hotel. I would never get bored!
"toilet was haunted" is crazy 😭😭
You should do rating 5 star hotels honestly one star😂
W video
"What do you do for a living?" "Investigating bad hotels and watching kung fu panda"
9:56 this is literally backroom
I LOVE HIS JAMMY DANCE😂

Have stayed at Magnolia several times. They gave you a deluxe room. That's not even close to their regular rooms. I call bullsh*t.
Pigeon in background   🗿
VIDEO IDEA FOR WHEN ALL THE JOY RIDE CANDY COMES OUT !!- Surviving on one penny (people love that) but every 1 (or 2 days) you have to buy any joy ride candy. BOOM the penny series is back for how long you want and marketing fir you awesome Sause candy!
CAN YOU MAKE GULTEN FREE  JOYRIDE
E.R.T hate the hote so bad that she wrote a 1500 words text about how bad this place is
When is joyride coming back
Ryan once your done with your   4 new candy (video idea) you should do visiting 50(or 48 countouis) states in 50(or 100) days starting with a penny.
I feel sorry for that toilet😂
PEOPLE WHO READ THE 5000 WORD ESSAY  👇

So this motel looks like the set for ALL the horror movies in all time
12:31 good one
Pls oin
12:13 haha

Hi Ryan from Australia
Are you in breaking bad Ryan
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟
I went into the Detroit hotel on a work trip. There were ants inside of my hair when I awoke.
Oi Ryan is joyride in Australia now
Ryan. New Mexico maybe the land of enchantment but it could also be ghetto af wherever you go. Can't go alone unless you got balls of steel. Next time don't go unprepared js
2:10 love how u can see some peeps in the background
he sounded dissapointed🤣 11:04
U probs wont see this but thnx for always being a positive vibe in this chaotic sometimes sad world! I love to just like laugh and feel the good energy!!!!

Thnx for the constant inspiration! I feel like u really make people wanna be better for better reasons! 🤙🏻

Thank you Ryan for being an amazing person. Have never seen kung fu panda but have seen joyride.
We love jack
RYAN pls see this but I think u should go to 5 star hotels and then u have to rate them one star. EVERYONE like this so he can see it!!!!
Ryan trahan should do 5 star hotels with 1 star review and it should be honest that would actually be amazing
How can you buy a stud finder and not try it on yourself?

Ryan instel  your candy in UK
Jesus is coming soon be ready and repent and know that God loves you ❤❤
My bro got so unlucky on hotel 3 getting the most haunted room of them all
1 question for joyride. When they hit the shelves will they released in the UK (northern Ireland specifically) as i would love to try them but i dont wanna go to america just to get candy. So PLEASE :(
Start a hotel but treat everyone like trash so we get 1 star reviews so ryan comes
I love how Ryan always goes on side quests every time he make a video like this

BRING JOYRIDE TO AUSTRALIAN STORESSSS
Can you pls sell joyride in the philipines😢 I really want it I been watching you since 2022😊
10:34 The clock is blinking because the time hasn't been set. There was probably a power outage, and once the clock regained power, it started from 00:00. Once you set the time, it won't blink anymore.
Get black light
ryan is it weird that i watch you when I am having a breakup ?
12:13 Thats one hell of a exhale
bro changed the thumbnail from "room 13 is haunted" to "don't sleep in room 13" bruhhh
How did he get room 511
I was thinking to watch this while eating, but on the 2:28 mark I stopped to inform you.... I am gonna watch it after eating...
So whoever E.R.T is, they're giving big Karen energy tbh 😂 could be a valid review, but dang, I just skim read it and they're just mad at everything 😂
Ryan, you should try staying at Cecil Hotel lmao
I NEED JOYRIDE IN LIDL.

Honestly Ryan is probably the best youtuber for hangovers, his funny entertaining mood is amazing.
ما شاف الفنادق اللي على طريق الساحل، مغسلة وفرشه واحمد ربك لو عطوك سفنج تقول هم اللي دفعولك.

Only if i had 0.999% of ur views
The Second Hotel reminded me on the Movie ,, Room 1408 ,, 🧐💀
Go to India 🇮🇳
Thank you for literally putting so much effort into your videos. Can we appreciate that for a moment people
Still enjoying these kinds of videos, still think its wrong you are leaving 5 star reviews for places and experiences that were clearly not worth 5 stars. Also, hotels having received one star doesn't make them 1-star hotels, neither in quality nor execution. ONly the motel 6 was an actual 1 star execution of a 2-3 star kind of location. Feels kind of weird for you to go to a 3 star hotel.
fun fact the first motel in the video was actually featured in better call saul (great series btw)
the elevator story is so stupid, like someone could've just accidentslly pressed that floor, thats it. does not mean its haunted
Dudu
start a jammy time chain :D                          ⬇
4:27 "Looks like a shot from Samsung S24 Ultra"
9:57 after watching I got freaked out for a minute thinking it was backrooms
Damn my name is Rebecca 😭
What if you did 1 star cinemas
if ur gonna do more ghost hunting in the future you could whatch sam and colby for tips???
Please go to the haunted place and explore it
Yay
Why do you shower, put on pyjamas and then exercise?
nahhh the wayy how he just does kanny time is so funny
The stud finder bit made me cackle😂😂😂😂
Don't do Cecil hotel in la it's an actual murderer tourist spot
What if he does rating 5 star hotels 1 star little switcharoo
That security guard deep lost in humanity was just so perfect😂
It was fun playing shuffle board with you!    (not me)
Did anyone see something off when he was showing the ghost decivce
18:00 umm kinda sus
This is ridiculous.. He is trying to make 5 star reviews while he is just chexking on 1 room.. U have to check the entire apartment 💀💀😭😭
I miss the penny series
DO A COLAB WITH SAM AND COLBY DOOOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAA COOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBB WWWWWWWIIIIITTTTTTTHHHHHHH SAM AND COLBY btw love your vids

W video
LOVE FROM INDIA 🇮🇳 ❤
Kung fu panda 4 was anything but fire
3m views in 19 hours is crazy
While I was watching the Haunted Hotel part I was hearing random people moaning in what sounded like pain, dogs barking, and random bangs of things falling over. Thing is I live in Australia where I think its at least a little less violent? Well there's at least no guns. Anyway was this a coincidence? Love your videos Ryan :)  Edit: Now I'm hearing loud power tools and possible chainsaws? :0
For the thumbnail: don’t sleep in pink room
That kung fu panda looked cured 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Vanity is a vibe ngl
Wanna be pppeter🇸🇰😂  (Don’t worry i enjoy the content)
18 hours and 3 mil views insane
hi Ryan
Oh my god!!! U were right on my campus in Detroit!! I’m so mad I didn’t see u!!
Hi l love ur videos and l hit the bell buttl sub and lke to u ❤
THE STUD FINDER SENT ME i kinda just assumed it was one of those emp things ghost hunter youtubers use and totally did not see that one coming I'm dying
You should do the worlds craziest and creative hotels
the kansas hotel receptionist was so excited and fun!
we want a new penny series,that was really fun ryan❤
Please launch it in India
Was I the only one who read the huge paragraph review for the last hotel 😂
Are you bringing joyride to ireland
My parents said that if i hit 3k subs before my birthday they will buy me an apple vision pro! Please i beg of you please i would be forever in debt to you!!!
1:22 made me laugh my socks off😂😂😂😂😂
The loading on the computer while ryan was talking 🤣 6:04
i love your vids Ryan keep up the good work👍
Aint no way the lady at the front desk was so happy about the hotel being haunted. "Yes it IIIIISSSS!" She was such a vibe
28:05 pleasure doing busswith u @ryan trahan
legends says. david S. is still waiting for he's food
Lmao yesterday I ended breaking bad (around the time he uploaded this vid) and the first place he visited is Albuquerque, New Mexico.😂
You should play teenage conan o Brien in a conan o Brien movie
yooo ryan can you tell me what music are you using in the video?? plss
HE WAS IN MY TOWN AGAIN BROOOO
omg breaking bad reference
Spend one night in the most hunted hotels/places.
22:43  not me just scanning the text and putting it in tts bc I’m too lazy to read it
the review at 22:43 is insane o.O
if ryan does horror stuff i’m all for it
18 HOURS AND HE HAS 131K LIKES THATS CRAZY AND I LOVE UR VIDS RYAN!!!
$36 for a motel isn’t that bad… a few seconds later… bullet holes
Omaha Steaks are the best, and as a former Omaha resident, Omaha can be a nice little oasis in the middle of the madness that is Nebraska. If you're feeling bold and daring, you could go into Western Nebraska and see what the middle of absolute fucking NOWHERE looks like...
16:34  Are you just lucky or unlucky to get the ROOM 511 and should you cry or be happy btw the lady was really really nice and friendly
BRUV WHEN I HEAD THE NAME OF THE THIRD HOTEL I WENT OH MY...GOD ITS MY FLOPPIN LAST NAME:( 13:39 AGHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bullet holes in the bed's backboard is actually WILD
Bro to check for bed bugs you have to see the corners of the mattresses for black marks , the actual mattress underneath every sheet! you need to be safe that stuff spreads like wildfire if you catch it 😅 love your videos man!
Come to Finland and test 1-star hotels!
Ryan's videos make me genuinely happy
Howdy!
ryan you doing “living off 0.01 cents for a month” soon??
Hey
i missed u
You have to appreciate the music
Can't believe they named a city after Omaha from TWD
bro retail your sour strips in india
Megabyte per second? Seriously?
These hotels aren’t really 1 stars in total but 3.4 stars wouldn’t be a good title
That last hotel is insane .. but the 2MB? Yikes. That's 1 star right there!
Mbps IS NOT Mb/s, 2.16 Mbps, is about 0.25Mb/s. This is horrendously slow
that review from ert is 900 words, longer than the english essay i never even wanted to do
At 26:06 i thought that was jack skellington in fortnite
Please keep going with this style of video. You are the only big YouTuber not being corrupted by the beastification of YouTube.
I’ve learned from TikTok that they shouldn’t say your room # out loud so another immediate 🚩 for the first place lol
what do they mean there not responsible for damage to vehicles how is locking my car gonna stop someone from putting something through my window
Was that a woody hat lmao 😂🤠
does joyride ship to the uk?
Ryan you should stay at haunted hotels next !!! That would be awesome
Hello Ryan if you would like to do a review at our house in Spain it would be for free so far it has 5 stars so if you would like to come you are welcome.
is no one talking about how the motion light went off, kinda creepy lol
Why does he keep sending himself to Albuquerque?
Hii
Ho
Ho
Hi
Hiii
The pain of the security guard when you ask for the vending machine 😂 anyway still watching your video!

Vanity seemed nice.
Ryan do 1 star gas stations
Ryan, You are the definition of the term "Look on the bright side!" and I love it. Keep up the good work!
need moooooreeee of these
Ryan you have one more movie to watch just letting you know
Bro the guard sounded so annoyed at 12:11
Watching this while working at a hotel, is good to know that my work is a lot better than these places LOL
The description 😂 😂 😂
Rayan is joyride available in India
I dont understand, do they change sheets after every person or every few people or what
Yo I stayed in room 2008 in the Mongolia hotel was a really nice place idk why people would rate it one star such a nice place with awesome staff was expensive tho
I absolutely love your optimism, but you were way too optimistic here. these hotels are horrible. I hope anyone who plans to stay in them, will see this video first.
dont watch kungfu panda 4 no furious five, no oogway and the grey leopard guy became good 1 star
Go to rainforest cafe is good
Stay in o block for a night
The 4th movie sucked
RYAN you need to deliver your SOUR STRIPS in Asia ived been dying to taste those good lookin candy
Bro how have you Not seen Kung fu panda i watched all the movies in One day😡😡
Good morning sleepyhead!!
OMG 13 TAYLORS NUMBER
bro. I have a bet. Bet you’ll not deliver any of the joyride here in mongolia Ulaanbaatar. (it’s expensive tbh)
may i have a pin i subbed
Please go and stay at the Cecil hotel on skid row
3:59 to 4:01 got me dying 😂
hi Ryan i wanna ask you can you send me some JoyRide pliss and yeah 😄
BREAST MILK?!
You didn't watch the show ryan. You forgot the show.
Diego was cool 👍🏻
Well there should be joyride in shop in ireland then
i knew i should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque.
I wish this place had a blue chair blue chair in the back
Once I painted a nerf gun in bed
5.046656,119.570093 my addres
I dare you to Go to haunted hotels and do a review
.
read it
Collab with sam and colby ❤❤❤
RYAN NO ONE CAN FIND ANY OF YOUR REVIEWS YOU LIAR!!! (Joking love the vids but I can’t find your reviews :(. )
He is one star hotel savior
Does he actually review the hotels or is it just for the video?
The first one is why so many people do not want to go to America at all costs
I think sometimes just being a decent polite and caring human being can get people good treatment. That and/or anyone getting a vibe that someone might be a vlogger/reviewer. I'm guessing that one or both of those things might have played a factor in getting the nicer room at the last hotel.
sainsburys?
Joyride is going to be the best like Prime and Feastables eventually it's gonna launch everywhere main countries would be Australia,every state in the USA and UK (By the way I live in Australia I would like to try atleast a candy of joyride since it's like 70-80% of less sugar that's good, so thanks for the vids of yours and Joyride good luck from Joyride) HOPE YOU READ THIS AND COMMENT OR LIKE RYAN. THE END... for now
is there a sam golbach picture in the thumbnail or am i tripping
A legend says that David is still waiting for his food.
The second hotel looks like he just entered a backrooms level
i felt very bad for ryan when he went to room 511 he mustve been incredibly nervous lol
Dude has zoomer bussin hair lmao
19:58 YO THERES EYES IN THE CORNER
Some people go to haunted hotels on purpose it brings in people that’s why they don’t hide it
This is so funny lol (am I the only one who thinks he looks like caylus who plays GTA5 lol no just me .... Ok)
That pull-up tool looks sus. Looks like it could rip stuff off the wall or otherwise cause damage. Although I guess that's not likely unless the framing was loose or otherwise attached incorrectly, or someone was particularly heavy weight or making sudden movements.
If joyride is with pork gelatin i cannot eat it im sorry
he doesn't fear social anxiety, social anxiety fears him.
You can't just see bedbugs, LOL. If you could then they'd literally be extinct by now (because they literally can _only_ survive with humans). They hide (typically inside mattresses, but can also be in walls or pillows or cushioning or such) until you're sleeping.  Also a lot of people are asymptomatic to their bites, so won't even notice the bedbugs (and bedbugs never carry any disease), so sleeping a long time somewhere without bite marks is not an indication that there is no infestation.
He kinda wasted time by watching all 3 kung fu panda movies because at the beginning of the fourth movie, they gave a small recap of what happened in the past movies….
12:11 the security guard was not having it
please try ceicile hotel 😊
hi im a big fan and my birthday is tommarow so can u please say happy bday also are your sour strips in dubai?
21:07 iconic af
Ryan you have to come to the Black Angus Inn in Anchorage Alaska. It has had the police called there so many times the city threatened to shut it down permanently or start charging code violations and fees per 911 call. Bedbugs, roaches, pewpewings, illicit substances, ladies of the night, and lots of alkyholism. It's bad. We need some yeehaw. Please come.
Looked up the St. Regis and he must’ve found a killer deal cause all of a sudden it’s $179 a night compared to the $118 “steal” Ryan got
Corny ass thumbnails
ryan: Kung Fu Panda is loading. me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you did go on shark tank, what would you show? Just asking because joyride is doing amazing!
Me and my friends stayed at the first hotel when in ABQ. The door latch came off exactly like it was kicked in by police before. We woke up to a BIG ass roach above our friends head. We still joke about it to this day.
22:43 I don't wanna read that.. 😅
you're so awesome that i can't believe you exist
I really like Ryan videos but I hope he is not leaving 5 star reviews for these places... I know it will only increase the average score they get 0.1% but if they don't deserve it, they don't deserve it.   If there are bullet holes in your room and stains in your blankets, that can never be a 5 star review.
Stinky poop in toilet 😂😂😂
while eating ramen he made an review about it
21:53 Megabit not Megabyte
faking not seeing movies is crazy.. like lying about such a lil thing really says how much of a good person you are
Ryan. To check for bed bugs, peel back fitted sheet to expose matress. Look in stiched crevices of matress for what appears to be small yellowish rice shaped particles. Those are the eggs, and will be easy to find and see with a flashlight.
ryan
the lie is blue chair
I’m sorry does the ghost wipe your butt? 💀💀
Ryan should go to that haunted clown motel
Im in jammy's too while im waching this
What happened to good morning sleepyheads? Btw you mean by “did the ghost wipe your butt?”
Jammy time 😮
2Mbs wifi is good I have 5
The benign calcification line made me die😂😂😂😂😂😂
can you do a road trip to Alaska pleassse
so cute when you say jammy time
Spock... toy... no... why?
yay.a new vid.
27:32 i bet its walmart or target
18:56 you are using a stud reader, which detects, where in there is wood behind the wall, which it’s commonly used for hanging up shelves, not finding ghost :l
Do you ever think about your ecological footprint for making these videos?
YOU FORGOT THE HAUNTED TOILET
RYAN GO TO FIVE STAR HOTELS AND RATE THEM 1 STAR OR IF THEYRE TOO GOOD 5 STARS
Bro did the biggest flex by putting a fx3 or fx30 outside. That shit expensive
I feel like leaving a 5 star review to a place with multiple bullet holes is not morally right
I'd like to clarify, 2Mbps is not 2 megabytes, but 2 mega bits per second transfer speed. This is slow, something like 200kb/s - 300kb/s
- the satellite view of this is crazy - it is a literal F for FAILIURE  0:31
He should do this series in Africa
Ryan has a dining room in his hotel room, yet he decides to sit on the floor in the living room 😂
I actually stayed at the third hotel in KC twice for theatre trips! There was half-eaten taco bell hidden behind the curtain that the cleaning staff did not pick up.
Omaha got into a bad relationship I guess… too much to read lol
You need to go to the Cecil hotel! Please make a video on that
My names John, so when he started talking about John's "clogged toilet", it kind of felt like he was talking to me.
vanity needs a  raise now i want to there!
You should go to the Cecil hotel
Omg in The last hotel it was built in 1929
You should try and go to more haunted hotels.
Yes, I think I’m also out of sour strips 😂
My guy has come to Albuquerque twice for YT… dawg hit me up next time and I can show the 24k Gold places to go to.  😂❤
Hey ryan i like you video!
I used to work in hotel Phillips that is like the dustiest place on earth. And I’m happy it made the list it’s too expensive and too many things wrong to be so expensive.
Are joy strips coming to Greece
will it be in australia??
Okay the bullet holes are actually crazy
Joyride on sharktank ?????
bro u are in the amc!
Honestly I really want a Sam and Colby collab with Ryan Trahan 😂.
Just remember that bro has to walk back each time just to get the camera back.
when ryan goes to a place it becomes gentle for him
Howdy!
nearly 3 mill views in less than 24 hrs is crazy
Watching this in 2025 gang  👇
the last rewiew was cokin a 183 words lonk review
Please Ryan what did the security guard say when you asked him abt the vending machines? That was hilarious! I have got to know what happened! 😂great video as always.
umm hi, can you release joyride sour stripes to malaysia?...just asking hehe.
@9:29  Ryan racist🤔🤔🤔
if it goes off idk what ill do lmaoo im dead
Joy Ride in Sharktanks would be crazy !
9:56 wel that is fr just the backrooms
You realize they literally did a Ghost Adventures episode at St Regis hotel?
I’m not trying to be rude in anyway or a different way but it sweets are so bad if u want explosive poop on ur toilet welcome aboard to the most baddest sweet alive
"i almost bought bitcoin in 2011"
RYAN GIVE ME FREE JOYRIDEEEEEEE
12:11 PLEASE WHEN I TELL YOU I BURSTED OUT LAUGHING
14:10 this guy makes entertaining videos but sometimes the millennial humor is hard to take… like what was that
I live in Detroit, that hotel is actually semi often used for crime related deals, but it’s not in the worst area of Detroit so it’s not really that bad to stay there as it could be. If you want really scary stays in Detroit you gotta go to the east part, or motels near gratiot Ave
"What was your *first* name?" Is crazy...
@jeff_264 😂
The comment section is getting infected more and more with the bots
The way my jaw genuinely dropped to the floor at the last hotel bruh. I’m gobsmacked
14:09 Bro the wheezing makes me concerned for his health
You should go to the grand hotel in the uk. That’s spooky
:D
NEBRASKA MENTIONED LETS GOOOOOOOO
votr for indian hotel riview
I think you'll love it
Let's goooo ryan uploaded
16:29
That security guard gets asked about the vending machines way to much you know he went of o Ryan and he just didn’t wanna show it love yuh Ryan I wanna be just like yuh in my own way12:15
Love it keep up the work
If you think that hotel was scary, go to any premier inn in the UK.
You should Go to  Michigan holly downtown
This is a reupload !!!!
The last one is a house😅
i'm keen to know if you asked for room 511😅😅
bro said 1 star reviews it comes to 3 stars 😂 XD
You told her you came for the haunted hotel so she gave you the worst room
Ryan when are you dropping more clothes??? I need more of your clothes.., 👀
These are good but...  Do you need to leave a 5 star review? It's disingenuous and unnecessary. Reviews are valuable so putting a dent in it (no matter how small) isn't needed.  The videos are great either way. I don't believe they'd be less popular if you did something else at the end instead.  If they're not actually being posted then feel free to totally ignore me lol
you sir are very annoying, why can't I stop watching?
Why all the reviews have name and first ketter of their surname?
Ert s comment is a whole book💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
The last hotel room is huge!!!
Have you heard of lying by omission?
bruh the toilet
15:50, Yeah completely normal to think those are ghosts. It's obviously IMPOSSIBLE a kid pressed all the buttons or someone pressed the wrong button..
Only OGs know about Brest milk in the fridge
Howdy Ryan I am your subscriber and I have a wish that you should go to haunted and scary hotels
the front desk lady at the haunted hotel is so sweet omg
Will It come to India ?
سکیبیڈی
Bro E.R.T is on drugs
29:07 🐼 😂
You know Vanity gave you Room 511 on purpose lol
I thought he wrote  it him self 511 I was like meh
The breast milk reference 😂 that clip had me ROLLING
Since it was a stud finder how didn't it find you? :)
YAY RYAN! I'M SO HAPPY FOR THE CANDY!!!!!!!!!!! (Coming from a diabetic)
It was one time-Ryan
Ann E. Are you okay?
Ryan? have you made some sort of deal with these hotels beforehand?????
That bird hopping around in the background at 1:33 needs a raise    Don't... Don't ask why. I'm a Wood Thrush awake at 2:48 AM when I'm supposed to be asleep at the first sign of dark. Plus, I show respect to all other bird species. Also, I get cranky when I'm past my bed time, so uh yeah.
15:46 “I heard is was haunted is it true?” “It sure is!!” “Oh…….”
okay so this is weird, but I work at hotel phillips often and I recall one night leaving the lobby thinking "Did I just see that youtuber I follow? no way."  Anyways, I'm there multiple times a week so I'll be asking staff about the haunted rooms as soon as possible and I'll update!
all hotels look like backrooms tho
where did you get the pull up gear?
whenever Ryan records himself walking away… all i can think about is him going back to grab it 😂
LOL.... the first room you got.... 211 is POlice code for armed robbery.....
Welcome to doors
alright congrats youre my new comfort youtuber ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?? YOU SHOULD BE!!!!  this is the kind of positivity i and everyone really needs - bad reviews are EVERYWHERE, but we need to remember kindness begets kindness. more often than not it seems the reviewer themself was problematic or unpleasent to the staff, or maybe the staff was having a bad day, or some other fluke like that. the world may seem rotten if you look at it in such a shallow surface level light, but the moment you take a step back and realize the grand scale of goodnees (and, again, being kind makes more kindness happen to you, on average) you realize,, its all pretty nice
Are the joyride strips coming to NewZealand?
Yes
Ryan… I don’t think that was paint on the sheets buddy.. I think people did the tango in bed.
Great video Loved joyride promo, Kung Fu Panda, Jack, and spooky yet enthusiastic front desk lady Enjoyed hot Cheetos while watching Glad you were safe at motel 6 Jammy time 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
smash?
People who think ryan is deserving of elite status ↓
Bro come to Romania and make a video please
Bros just doing side quests
W video. Best room for last. Ryan u okay? 5 stars
Why is people always hating on rebbeca
okay luv u ryan have a great night
so now we're here
I love kung fu panda 4
I also just put on my jammies and was forced into an unnecessary position to do a jammy jig
"i wish i bought bitcoin in 2011"    me too
Ryan should visit 5-star hotels but has to leave a 1-star reviews 😂
Every like this comment gets Ryan will grow 1 inch
yo ryan what pull up thing on the door was that? Im trying to find a good one that wont leave marks on my door too
Good video
Bro this is carzy
So how do we put the toumpscoopm with the flabertragustust without no brunksenkinks and no inclariousbomberious noodles
Can't have sht in Detroit.
Someone left a yelp comment after this video came out to Hotel Phillips saying Rebecca shot their dog and parents in the throat💀💀
since you don’t mess with paranormal you should definitely go ghost hunting with sam and colby. definitely nothing scary happens for them
RYANNNN we missed you!!
jammy time
How do bot comments get so many likes?? Who enjoys them honestly??
ryan I have $-13.07 in my account but I'd do anything to have your candy.  just give me a week to get my bread up
if you’re new here, let’s wonder why ryan always checks for breast milk, only og’s will know..
I know for a fact she gave u room 511 because you said you came bc it was haunted 😭😭
I have a favor to ask if you can come California blythe On April '22 Go to albertsons And ask the cashiers for Juan Ramos and say if someone having a birthday in your family
The sshwhshshs Like shshesh and subscribe shshssh got me😂
i live in austria they will never come to us
i was just looking at hotel phillips reviews and found this:  *Rebecca G. Bavaria, KS 01 Apr 13, 2024 1 STAR! Worst hotel i have ever been too, At 3AM Rebecca broke into my hotel room, Shot my dog and stabbed both my parents in the throat, She stared at me with Malevolent eyes and said "Nemo tibi umquam credet." I was forced to get into a gun fight with her, Several rounds were fired straight into her chest, Doing NO DAMAGE She was barely affected as if the bullet were as a tickle to her. I was forced to grab a taser and a knife and put her down. Room 511 was stained with blood and the ghost of Rebecca remains in there. I have been diagnosed with PTSD ever since this moment. Worst hotel ever. Chicken tenders were okay* i have a feeling this is made up
I got a challenge, go to guinea and dont use a generator for a week
As someone who has stayed in the magnolia it is not that bad
Huh 511 more like 911 of ghosts
I’m shocked you want to leave any of these hotels. Gave the Motel 6 5 stars. Could’ve saved a lot of time and money and stayed there the entire week. LoL
Do not translate… سيتوقف قلبك عن النبض في غضون ساعات قليلة الطريقة الوحيدة لوقف هذه اللعنة  .هو عن طريق الاشتراك بي...
If you’re in Anchorage stay at Black Angus Inn. 2.6 stars average.
The thumbnail gives off "Night shift" horror movie vibes in the bg ..... does anyone agree ?
Yo my sister lives in Abq and i am visiting may 5 2024
Ryan casually using a stud finder as ghost equipment
13:40 Bro literally said kansas city is in Missouri 😂😂😂. BUT ITS IN KANSAS
RYAN, DO THE RESTAURANTS AGAIN.
Ur vidio never dissapoint me
Dang, you were so close to me too bad i didn't see you! Would have Givin you a howdy! 😁
ryan trahan is the G.O.A.T!!
I wish my name was Greg
My name is Jason
Ryan, you never order food to your door at a hotel… that’s what people look for when scoping out who to rob…
love he’s videos
Bro 12:11 the guard just like. I don’t get paid enough for this 😂😂😂
can you do like a haunted house one?!
WOAH woah Ryan! Total cliff hanger with the Security guard/vending machine incident! I NEED to know what happened after the intense *exhale*!
Ryan you should go to the Clown Motel!
Maybe you should give a review of Cecil hotel (the haunted hotel), if you do then all the best👍👍
So are we just not gonna mention the plate of BLOOD! 😫
ryan i know you probably won’t see this but you are my comfort youtuber and you’re my favorite as well. i enjoy watching you and everytime you post i click immediately. please never stop posting you make me enjoy life !! i love ya and i want to try your candy so bad especially because it’s healthy and sounds delicious !!
i read the long review
16:56
Who saw the flipping head poking out the bathroom at Philips
None of the reviews are on Google 😔
13:43 please tell me im not the only one who thought that building was a giant fence?
I feel like the one in Detroit is more Haunted than in Kansas City 😂. But honestly, it would be my worst nightmare in both hotel 😂.
One time I found a condom wrapper in my hotel
Toilet was haunted.. 5 STARS
Pls have joyride in china plsss
Ur content is lazy n boring n that's coming from me
I love your video’s keep up the good work
Love ur videos man!! Can u make a video on 1 star hotels in India?(Try it at ur own risk)
Sleepy Ryan sounds like wisdom tooth Ryan
Ryan did you pee your self in room 511 pls answer
22:43 I read it all.
i really want to try your sour strips but im from the philippines ARGHHHHHH
Alr
Stay at hotel Cecil in LA
Make your candy Kosher
12:21 bro looked so disappointed 😂
The only emergency that guy coughing at that first motel could have is losing his lighter
Bro, I literally watched Kung-fu  Panda 4 yesterday.
Warning ryan is only making positive and fun on this video but that doesnt mean the reviews are false and lie so be carefull
as an omaha native, it brings a tear to my eye to see Ryan enjoying my city. Ne rep!
Motel 6 was so ooo dangouous
"ITS me RhY- OH mY GoODNesS" had me on the floorrr
can anyone talk about the pigeon in the back?
I WANT JOYRIDE TO COME TO AUSTRALIA
Motel 6 is the last place you Wanna be..
RYAN I LIVE IN OMAHA AND YIU WENT INTO THE RED TELEPHONE BOOTH THAT I ONCE WENT INTO
Yessss Ryan postedddd 😊
How can this man have fun anywhere? like if you put him in a garbage dump, he would have the time of his life!
Omg vanity was so adorable and cheerful
I found the joyride sour gummy worms at a local supermarket and I was so surprised, obviously I had to buy them just to support my fellow Texan Ryan Trahan and also cus I like gummy worms, they were really good, they tasted like if fruit snacks were sour (and shaped like worms) 8/10 would recommend
did the security guy ever answer you after his deep sigh
I love you so much Ryan, ur literally like an angel 😭
Sam and Colby x Ryan Trahan when
Stay at most haunted hotels
Does anyone know what the background music is at? 28:35 and 0:19
It seems that no one here is an Sam & Colby fan..  Sam and Colby fans?  👇
These videos are great but it's incredibly easy to carry bed bugs back to your home on your clothing, socks, shoes, luggage, etc. It would be very wise to change before going into your home and bag all of your clothing and shoes and either leave the bag in the sun to bake in the heat or tumble dry on hot at a laundromat.
@RyanTrahan is it coming to Australia
Ryan you act like my dad at the shops so i count you my youtube dad
Wait, if ghosts have static electricity, can't you just tape balloons to the ceiling??????
i love how he spends his time getting the best shots for us
did you ever get that bitcoin?
She definitely gave him that room on purpose.
The stud finder made me laugh too hard xD.
12:11 wait what happend after this lmao
Haunted hotels series plzzz
Ryan looked so sad when the vending machine didnt work 😭
"I almost bought bitcoin in 2011"💀
Tôi nghĩ bạn nên thêm bản âm thanh việt nam
Ryan + Sam and Colby ?? *i need this to live*
“Jammy time”, is AMAZING !
The fa+t that this was 14 hs ago
Can you bring joyride to 🇬🇧 UK
Haley Just watching this...
I’ve been to worst hotels honestly this is a vacation to what I felt with in LA
Bros life has no filler episodes
2Mb/s isn’t that bad. My Xbox downloads stuff at 750 kilobytes to 7 megabytes per second 💀
Bro was in Michigan again. 😭
Idk what to say
Now we all know, no one is gonna read ERTs review on their own time. 🤣🤣
you need to go to SF and stay in the tenderloin
build a secret room and then get hunted by some one and see if they find u
did the ghost wipe your butt 🤣🤣
When I saw Saint Regis on the board I got confused, I went there so many times and each time it gets better and better
"Rules: He has to leave 5 star reviews, and can't lie" i will never understand that
Do the most haunted hotels in the country, I think that would be pretty interesting
✋🙂‍↕️
You spelled Albuquerque wrong
More reviews Ryan! 😊
Ryan never fails to make my wiggle my crusted toes on a Saturday evening
Those noises are from people living inside the walls
When Ryan was playing the audio my dog started barking at 12:00 and jumped scared me. 😭
You know it’s gonna be a good day when Ryan posts👍👍‼️
Imposter syndrome 😭😭😭
Bro missed out on making a Breaking Bad reference at that sketchy Albuquerque hotel.
Yayaya I didn’t come from tiktok
jam jam time
What the sigma
The stud finder being used as a ghost-hunter material is just great.
Paused: Haven’t watched this segment yet, but I’ve ALWAYS wanted to stay at the St. Regis bec my ex had a family reunion there in 2012 and it was BEAUTIFUL. I also love to eat at the chicken and waffles and waffle spot at the corner; the name is escaping me for the moment. I’m really heartbroken this even came up on your search.   Also, it’s not as if I’m not able to afford the hotel, i just live here and own a home here, it’s very seldom if ever, that I need a hotel downtown. I live 17 min away lol.
Bring joyride to Australia 😂
Please go to clown motel in Nevada there is cemetery next to it 🤡🔥
what if five star hotel but have to rate it with one star
I love this iconic song in all your songs and the oof in the review😂😂😂

A list of Ryan’s favorite words  Cheers  Howdy  Thanks so much
Ryan: Hi! Do you know where the vending machine is?😃.  The security guard: *deep inhale*  *deep exhale*  I just feel so bad for Ryan for some reason😭😭
Petition for ryan to go to the cecil hotel 👇

Kung Fu Panda hits different though
Go to Ocean View in VA Beach lol. You want a true experience go their. Went their and was mind blown with the stuff I seen and smelt.
ryan never go to the little ceasars in alpine wyoming… would be a fire vid tho
You are the most positive person, Ryan. The world needs more people like you.😅
I’m so sorry you had no childhood Ryan. Not seeing Kung Fu Panda is tragic
every like this comment get's ill do 9 handstands
ik u dont do spooky but it would be so cool if u did a video solely on haunted hotels !!
i was eating your joyrides! They are AMAZING! i loved the video keep up the good work Ryan!
THIS IS TERRIFYING I'M WATCHING THIS AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING 20:50
Bro that is not kung-fu panda thats karate bear ☠️
I really want to try your candy!!! It is an amazing idea to have healthier candy! You are awesome. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Do a video with Sam and Colby
Next video you should do testing haunted/paranormal reviews :D
✨Jammie time✨
17:49 best transition iv ever seen
Hey Ryan it are Belgium fries! Don’t believe me? Search it pls thx 🙏 thx 🙏 thx 🙏
The out of service bus is the most downtown KC thing ever
honestly ryan is the only youtuber i actually still enjoy
Sooooo that hill you zoomed into at 4:00 is where I went to high school teehee
bro i have 1 mbps in my home ....its quite fast compared to the area
how have u not seen kung fu panda
Idea: vist five stars hotel but you have to write a 1 star review.
🔳🔲▪️
I went to this hotel terrible for me
Trade offer accepted.
I love your “I tested “ videos 10/10 love them 😊
13 hours early
ryan go to 1 star restaurants
Who the heck names their kid vanity💀
So, in case anybody wants to know, the candy is most likely going to end up at Walmart because they are the biggest retailers for YouTube candy and other junk food products. If it’s not Walmart, I’m gonna be surprised.
Im from Albuquerque and everything said is accurate 😅 its scary, dirty, and just creepy. No safe places and honestly not a place to go nothing fun expect balloon Fiesta
you and Sam and Colby gotta do a collab
Ryan always puts a smile on your face when your down
I would get Joyride but I'm in Canada :(((((((((((((((((((
YOOO KANSAS CITY HYPE!! Hotel Philips is in Kansas City, MO tho, so your Kansas joke....... 😂
Isn’t that the motel in Albuquerque where the girl was killed in the bathtub?
E.R.T wrote a whole book about his experience at the hotel lol
The security guard 😂😂😂
24:18 what happened at this moment?
done
Phfff puff like and subscribe 😂
Bring a black light next time
It's shocking to see such contrasting reviews and your own experiences at these places. Looking forward to where the quest for the 'perfect' five-star review leads you next.
Bro you should do a video where u explore gym in a hotel, maybe disneyland hotel?
I liked my own comment😂
I went to stay at a hotel in florida on vacation. It looked nice online so we booked it. Arrived it was super run down nothing like the pictures. We get  to the room and it was nasty af in there. Baking soda or some cleanin powder dumped on furniture Luckily there was a cockroach in the bathtub so we got to get a refund and leave but man the pilice showed up while we were leaving too. U need to go there😂
who loves ryan?  he's so entertaining and funny. been watching you since the first penny challenge
Literally amazing. Your actually the best YouTuber, the king fu panda thing is SO funny your so amazing 5 stars easily
I don’t know if it’s just me but whenever Ryan uploads a video my day instantly gets better 😁
Ryan, you're falling off.. YOU the genius of creating brilliant new video ideas is reusing STOP.. AND CREATE
I have a ghost that's not even a ghost when I was 2
My dude I can’t believe you legit stayed in a motel near the freeway in Albuquerque 😂 the moment I saw lobo village I was like this is one brave soul. Being a native New Mexican I could NEVER get myself to stay in a place like that and growing up I grew up near Montgomery and Carlisle which now isn’t the best, you’re a true champion 🏆
Now go and stay in 5 star hotels
Ryan one reccomendation: DON'T EAT JOYRIDE OR ANY CANDY BEFORE BED IT AFFECTS YOUR SLEEP VERY BADLY AND MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOUR SLEEP SCORE WAS LOW
The fact that I was in Chicago when you were in Detroit you would have been 16 mins away if I was there 😭😪
17:03 the stud finder 😂
Bro said medium but he should of gotten rare 1 star
bro really left an fx3 out lmao that is wild
Candy idea for Ryan: Sour Gummy Worms
E.R.T was probably just mad he and his team didn't get to stay at the embassy suites and went into to it with a negative attitude.
Last hotel wasn’t a hotel is was a luxury apartment
Wasnt the thumbnail “there is a creepy man in the hallway” or smth like that, or am i trippin
you should've check if there's spy cam too
"Fun" fact there are more Panda Expresses than Actual pandas. that's pretty sad. 💀
She gave him room 511 because he said he came just because he heard the hotel is haunted.
am i going bonkers or did the thumbnail change(the message changed from room 13 is haunted to dont sleep in room 13)
stranger on the internet teaches me not to trust reviews [ lol love you ryan keep up the good work]
Ryan when r u gonna do another penny challange u loved when you did that
Justice For John M. And His Masterpiece 👇
Bro you brand for candy sounds like its laced candy and school wont let me bring it
He went from the penny master to the 1star master
Bro Albuquerque is crazy. I live here in New Mexico. Shout out to you for taking on that place.😂
I could do with steak an chips, the jealousy i felt seeing that meal.
lol that security 🤣
19:08 I was like "thats a stud finder wtf" 😭
you should come to torrington wy we have a crazy hotel here this place is small and quiet

That detroit hotel looked like a serious backrooms scenario lol.
You are fun to watch but this definitely wasn’t close to the worst hotels in America. NOT CLOSE 😂
Trahan is a guy who would do anything to give people trust to something they think its bad.
HOWDY GANG LIKE HERE 👇🤠
willy wanka is that you?

22:43 😂😂😂
HE SOUNDED DISSAPOINTED THAT THERE WS NO BREAST MILK LOL ( 11:05 )
Someone did crack on that desk.
If this series continues, I have to recommend the Red Lion Inn and Suites, Governor Hotel in Olympia WA.
JAMMY TIME
Love the video ❤😊
Amazing video ❤😊
We need to normalize jammy time
Amazing content!
ryan is the type of guy to write a review about how someone shot him two times in the hotel, but he lived so 5 stars
sjhdgfegf
please do another 1 star restaurant
love how ryan keeps saying jammy time but wakes up without his jammys everyday
16:52 he definitely planned to have 511
Don't translate... ฉันจะสมัครรับข้อมูลใครก็ตามที่สมัครรับ ข้อมูลฉันและชอบความคิดเห็นนี้..
Ryan can you please try the Langlands hotel in Invercargill,NZ
Go to the Fister in Milwaukee
I was stoked when they gave him 511 😂
A montage of Ryan walking back to get his camera
Need Ryan to try other countries
You should let one of your friends test out 1 star hotel just in case the hotels now who you are and choose a friend that nobody nows and cares about so when he's at the 1 star hotel we can see if he is treated different.
wait is 2mbps bad?? mines like 1 mbps 😭
vanity is so nice n friendly
So when's the Sam and Colby collab
JAMMY TIME!!!👍👍🔥🔥
Congrats on the 10k pr
What uo Ryan
Spock NOOOOO

I love the vids.  It's mega BITS per second
12:20 that long inhale to exhale......
God bless you guys the only way to heaven is by believing in your heart and confessing with your mouth that Jesus is your Lord and savior! Do you need prayer or praise over anything my friends?
Dude you giving 5 stars when you know it's not. Why
Why do you have the Casetify Toile case in blue
John marstion

If you didn’t come from a different planet you’re not allowed to like this comment
11:03 =💀
What did the security guard say?
Cecil Hotel (The Stay On Main), Just sayin
don't stay at a motel 6 in abq, i was born and raised here and it gets insane in those hotels!!!
I’ve never actually stayed in a hotel with hard wood floors….
I think the second Hotel is spooky because of there are no people there
Hi Ryan video ideas one is that you visit five haunted hotels or you could collaborate with Sam and Colby
I was staying there the time this was filmed idk how I didn’t see him but that’s awesome
god posted so im happy luv u ryan
That’s yellow device is a wood detector 😂❤
The pigeon just chilling at the start

If you think any of these are bad, try to stay a night in the Pine Rivers Motel in Brisbane.
i live in detroit and seeing ryan go into one of my favorite ramen places is kind of weird ngl
You should stay in a hunted hotel in ouray Colorado
"Ahh its a stud finder" 😂😂 funny!
Anyone named rebecca sucks
Of all videos I least expected my college to be shown in a 1 star hotel video lol
The cockroaches aren’t the flying kind, so that’s good🤠
Watching while in a hotel vibes
You should try visiting haunted hotels next time
"Kansas City, Missouri" 😆
maybe they be gate keeping lmao

10/10 experience while watching in the bath good to play with bubbles while watching Ryan trahan

Ryan your probably not gonna see this but can you go to 5 star places and leave a honest 1 star review?!
Arizona sunsets are better then the New Mexico one

pov ryan figurs out what a stud finder is
If you do a part 3, look into The Ritz Motel in Paoli, Indiana. It has a 2.9 overall, but is considered a one star hotel. Please reply if you decide to visit… I live nearby, and would love to meet you at some point.
Try get klay again
HIIIII
In vr😭
Shaky breaky with klay😭

"Staff was soo nice"      (while he holds a camera in his face...)

Ryan brought a stud finder😂😂😂😂
Remember shaky breaky😭
What your worst hotel experience, my was at el paso, the bed was hard and next morning, I got bed bugs bite
You should try going too 5-star hotels and leaving 1-star reviews.
Hey Ryan, great video. Could you do one at the Cecil Hotel or Stanley. That would be cool 😎
Let’s be honest that 1st hotel does not get a 5star
22:44 I read it
IM SOME WHAT EARLY, 12 HOURS EARLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Two people didn’t like Rebecca
I think I want to marry Vanity
I wish i can meet you bro
come so san Bernardino in CA pls we got under 2 stars easily
Dude.. that motel full of bullet holes should be condemned.  You were clearly in a drug den
UNDER 24 HRS TEAM
This is just such an amazing thumbnail. Wow
Yes you went to Detroit!!! (I’ve been waiting for this moment)
You should check out the Geiser Grand Hotel in Baker City, Oregon. The reviews are INSANELY bad! The owner Barbara is apparently a menace 😳
You should try the empress hotel in New Orleans La. 😂
My is my uncle picture.
Ngl Ryan is now my favorite YouTuber. LOVE THE CONTENT 😊
Yos… again!!!!!!
I'm the one in april 10 in the cinema you might ask me where do I live. I live in                                                                                                                                   🔽                                                                                                                                                     Saudi Arabia
I KNOW HIM AND HE IS AMAZING BUT I FORGOT TO SUB TO HIM I SUBBED NOW UR AMAZING
That security guard aint had to do you dirty like that
It should say going one star rated review hotels not one start hotels when they have a rated overall of 3.1 lol
20:52 good job ghost :)
I hate you                   Just kidding I really love you Katia you are the best YouTuber I’ve ever seen❤😊❤😊
Could someone please simplify the review at 22:44
Only Ryan can hunt for ghosts with a stud finder.
Shielded by the spirit of God amen 👏
MAKE YOU CANDY KOSHER PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
Ryan I don’t know if you were trying to be funny but you bought a studfinder
I immediately knew he was using a stud finder as soon as it went off constantly.
I’m gonna watch this movie tomorrow
JAMMY TIME IS THE BEST TIME 🎉🎉
You forgot about Rebecca, go back and find her! LOL just kidding!
20:02 NukesTop5 voice : did you see it?
I’m sorry to say this Ryan, but you are not pulling up those sunglasses get new ones.
Fancy ahhh PJs
Not Ryan using a stud finder to look for ghosts 😭🙏
PLEASE MOVE TO OMAHA WE ONLY HAVE ONE OTHER GOOD YOUTUBER
I can just imagine ghosts having a laugh while turning the lights, faucets, and other stuff on and off.
this and the 1 star fast food video have omaha ne!! idk when you are from a random ass town you get so excited seeing it in here- it’s so funny because both videos now he has loved the place 😊
Love how his first stop is albuquerque. I live in abq
Jammy time lol 😂
Hi
Doing an entire video around a Kung Fu Panda 4 promo the way you did is wild
🤓🤓After further inspection, I have realised that not all the hotels have a 1-star rating
Down town Omaha 🥶💯
My grandma and my aunt were at Moto 6 one time nothing bad really happened. I don’t think I wasn’t there really I don’t know how long they were there
Ryan, you may do this off camera, but please look on the *underside* of the mattress for bed bugs, as well! It's important you remove the sheet and everything. :))
16:34 plot twist:every room is 511
Bro I literally saw joyride at home goods😂😂😂
THE SIGH 🤣😭
Nah bc why you keep coming to New Mexico and I don’t see you man 😢
Bro Ryan is the most funniest person on yt. I love his sarcasm. If you agree raise your hand 🙋‍♀️
Are those pajamas? It looks like a dress shirt 😂
Ryan please send joyride to Australia I'm hungry for sour straps, they look tasty
Bro claims he watched Kung Fu Panda and didn't mention Master Oogway once, I'm sceptical to say the least...
NOO WAY THIS MANS CANDY IS COMING TO A STORE NEAR ME... I LIVE IN HONG KONG
A bonus peephole 😂
the first five minutes is essentially a sponsorship for isleta lol😂😂😂
That Motel 6 looks like something straight out of Breaking Bad
the new joyride is at REI
ryan finally uploaded
Hi
26:44 OMG IM NOT KIDDING THAT SOUND JUST LIKE MY DOORBELL
W
John failed to use the John
I could probably do a backflip if I gave it 100% effort buuuuut I dont think im gonna 👨‍🎓
That steak was breathing
"Well im now in the Back rooms of Detroit" caught me off guard😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am so happy about your reveal for one of the next joyride Ryan!
Jammy timeeee
Team people who read E.R.T’S whole   👇 review.
I went to the Super 8 in abq, that was worse than Motel 6. There were gunshot holes in the wall for some reason. There was also a truck that looked like it had a body in the back.
King fu panda two is the best one
Good work
hotel clocks being set to the right time is a 50/50 in my experience
2 mil views in less than 12 hours Ryan is just wow
👇
Ryan da best
No Ryan this a ghost but it’s like kung fu panda
💀
it was funny when ryan made a tiny sport for kung fo panda 🐼 on the bed then in the next morning it was gone 😂
I can't what to try joyride
when will it come to malaysia
I’m so glad you let us know how kung fu panda 4 turned out because the whole entire time I was like well is he gonna like kung fu panda 4 I need to know
the ramen place you went to is across the street from my classes I cant believe you were so near by lol
Why do you look like Alice from Brady Bunch in your thumbnail to me. 😂
*Yee Haw* ..........  Oh ..uhh Also.. *Skadoosh*
If Ryan moving to Omaha then so am I
Jack 🥺🥹❤️
Lollllll😅😅
“HOTEL PHILLIP” “what room?” “511?!”
I went to home goods and got the red licorice joyride there and it was great!
ye
that was a great video. I like seeing the different hotels.
Vanity sounds so cool.
Yes Ryan’s back !
4:07 the angel he is he tried finding the coughing man 😢
OMG I've been to that restaurant at 12:02! That would be so funny if I met Ryan there irl
WYNDHAM GARDEN “HOTEL” in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Not that bad reviews but this was THE WORST hotel. Smelled like axe CONSTANTLY. Holes in the blinds. Screaming noises. This place is crazy
Bro pulled out a stud finder😂
22:42 blud wrote the whole essay and rate 1/5 stars
Hotel Phillips might just be the inspiration behind a horror movie I saw.
hold up but was it me or he literally said '' time for me to play with my toys now ''
14:09 What is that laugh XD
The one in Kcmo killed me 😂 that home ❤️
it made my day when he got fries
Bro was in my city and didn't tell me?
2nd hotel is like a maze or backrooms
21:06  I’m out of sour strips
“Im out of sour strips” that’s all Ryan cared about in the middle of the night in a haunted room
please bring joyride to canada
Thanks for shouting out Omaha!
That's a stud finder or what ever that is called
As a Missourian I’m sad I didn’t see Ryan :(
We love you Ryan dayy one million of waiting for a reply I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO ENTERTAINING
gunshots in the motel 6 in abq oh im sure ⚠️
Ryan did you watch all the minion movie'?
"ghost hunting equipment" **stud finder**
5 Seconds in i saw toilet was haunted.
Great day when Ryan posts
How much a single person can do in a single night? Jammy time, paranormal investigation, Kung Fu panda AND the yelp thing. Oh man you work hard! Loved this one, but Ryan the first hotel kinda scared me a little bit. Please take care of yourself and try not to risk it too much. 😅
banger
I saw a new video and actually screamed out loud
Ryan should win a Guinness World Record for best youtuber!
OMG Ryan, I used to live in the apartments/dorms behind the Motel 6 when you messaged me back in 2017 😂   It is indeed dangerous 😅 Albuquerque as a whole really
Anyone watching from India ❤
when ryan when to his last hotel room i thought that he went back to the lobby because it was that big
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Funny blonde man made me laugh  Jammy time happens to be my favorite time  Trade offer to watch Ryan eat milk and cookies was a steal  Joyride strawberry sour strips make me happy
I work at a Hilton now and some guy left us a 1 star review the other day and if we could leave reviews on guests we would have given him the same lol it's not always the hotel...it's the person
This is definitely one of the funniest and one of my new favorite ryan trahan videos, Ryan Trahan you are my favorite youtuber and the best, keep up the amazing work💫👍
こんにちは、ライアン。私の「for you」ページであなたを見つけたので、このビデオを見ることにしました。素晴らしい仕事ですね :)
The girl saying “really?” Was so cute 🥺😂
Try Hotel Cecil
Ahhh, Ryan at 21:54 😂 you said "2 megabyte" when it shows 2Mbps, that's megabit per second. Capital M and B would refer to Megabyte. 😅
HI ryan
the lady at the desk at the 3 hotel is such a vibe
Love the vid is no one going to talk about how he eats milk and cookies 28:18 time
Get Sam and Colby to investigate that haunted hotel!
i loved this video, it was so entertaining
I love kc ❤
New candy!!!!!!!!!!!
That security guard was js doing breathing exercises
4:11 THE DEATHLY COUGH 😂😂😂
"The toilet gave me herpes, but I needed to visit a doctor for my annual checkup anyways. 5 stars."
Vanity is the most cheerful front desk lady I've ever heard
Last hotel was probably as big as my house
RYAN IT MY BIRTHDAY TODAY!!!!! I AM TURN !)!!!!!
3rd hotel. well someone better call @samandcolby
LOVE UR VIDS RYAN
OMG IM SO EXCITED i found joyride sour orange gummy bears at my local amc theater and made a video eating them absolutely amazing 10/10 u rock ryan make more candy we all love it
Ain’t Albuquerque something ✨
a ghost could be a guy named craig
Bro turned in to Sam & Colby at the third hotel 💀
Ryan is the definition of never let them know your next move
Nice. Keep it up Ryan!
would you like to explain why most of them are 3.0 stars ryan? ☝🧐
No one: Ryan: leaves a $5000 camera outside a public living space
"I'ma play with my toys"💀😂
Ngl you look like jack doherty, just thinking of him makes me mad hahaha
28:01 the trade offer with the tiktok font was a nostalgic flashback holy
I don't think the two truths and a lie game had a lie
I'm from glenwood 15 minutes away from Omaha
lol I stayed at that hotel in Detroit 3 years ago for a work trip. I literally took a picture of the hallway because it looked super fancy. Got a bunch of food delivered, got snacks from the vending machine, and watched baseball that night ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Kung fo panda 4 is a awesome movie 😊      Ryan I have been watching your vids for ages I love them❤
what website do you post the review on? I can’t find it 😭
Room 511 is haunted by a person
If getting room 511 was not set up ahead of time, then i wonder if the front desk lady decided to assign him to room 511 after he talked about the hotel being haunted. Typically, nowadays, hotels won't assign a room number until check-in, just my theory lol
b
omg I also watched kung fu panda 4 but had never seen the other ones. I couldn't find kung fu panda 1 or 2 anywhere so could only watch the third and was very confused :(
we need another ghostbuster on hotels
bro somehow makes 1 star hotels and food places good
Ok so I went to go to a concert in Milwaukee Wisconsin and I went to a hotel because I live a few hours away.. JEFFRY DARHMER AND THE BEETLES STAYED THERE !
When is your next penny challenge
My fiance and I stayed ay hotel Phillips and it was a fantastic stay. We got super excited to see you stayed there.
From Someone who lived and is familiar with that area of Detroit; True story: Wayne State once over crowded their housing halls, so St. Regis was the back up plan, thats where college students were housed for a period of time.
BROOOO I FELL KNEE DEEP IN THIS SERIES LIKE THREE DAYS AGO SO SEEING THIS IS NEW IS ACTUALLY CRAZY BRO
Yay a new video from Ryan! 👏
outlets in the first hotel look burnt
How ironic I’m watching this video while eating in a hotel
Best YouTuber
I'm pretty sure at  13:48 you can see the angles butt
Test 1 star hospitals
Come to belfast 😂
so glad omaha was so good to you Ryan! WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU ANYTIME MY GUY. Hope you had a great time :)
Can come to malaysia ryan?
It made me more glad to watch this video before my other South African friend watched it😅😅 11 hours after drop. South Africa 🇿🇦 📍
You should try to stay at the cecil hotel next. Love your videos!
20:03 asmr😂
Kung Fu Panda 1-3 are literally the best movies of all time. I was really disappointed when I went to 4 on the day it came out because it is so bad compared to the other 3.
Ryan is so genuinely wholesome its actually insane
ryan you bought the fanciest room of course its not 1 star, you definitely should have gotten 439
👇 ppl who read the super big comment on the last hotel
Try to give the Cecil Hotel a five star review
Is no one gonna talk about THE GIANT REVEIW 22:43 OMG THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN DAYS TO RIGHT also Ryan your cool :D
I saw your candy today at both Walmart and a similar store called Hyvee! And I wasn’t sure if someone was ripping your brand but now I know you are in all stores ! That’s great!!🤓🙏
I wonder if that nm hotel has a monthly rate i might have to send the inlaws there😂😂😂 i am wondering you will notice there is a difference in the animation style, the first three were better,
Motel 6 is goated these days
Ur vids are z best :D
These are some of my fave videos. Keep making em!
11:04 bro is still haunted by the breast milk 😂
Wait you didn't show what happened with the vending machine security guard
not the motel 6 bro
what scares me is at 28:59 panda went so sleep with Ryan and disappeared when he woke up and now I'm scared
@samandcolby colab???
I cant get joyride they don’t sell it in Hong Kong
Bro got a stud detector as a ghost hunting device man WTH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi Ryan!
I like the way how he had jammy time and then woke up with no shirt on❤️😂
"did the ghost wipe your butt?" I lost it lmaaaoooo
Missouri!!!
I wonder if Ryan goes to hotels where the place is famous for movies or shows. The only thing that's on my mind is Breaking Bad when Abq is shown on the screen
Can't wait for Ryan's reaction watching the 4th movie and being like "Uhm, excuse me, what the actual f-"
this is my fav video
I saw suckers at my TJ Maxx. I regret not getting them!
Ryan’s review vids>>>>>
bruh ryan has been within a 15 mile radius of me house twice now and both times ive been not home
Best type of vids
Ryan can u release some in idaho? i live there
24:28 bro that’s a whole wannabe Airbnb, not a hotel, no way that’s a low star hotel or “Airbnb”
16:41 Bro, told them he came cause it's haunted so they did him a favor and gave him the room they thought he wanted.
❤
24:45 ….. yk I think when the universe had these ppl right a 1 star review…… the universe was having a stroke……..
Ppl in Australia😢
DID HE LEAVE AN FX3 OUTSIDE HIS HOTEL ROOM!!
..Again?
Not me going into the same exact toy store as Ryan last summer
Wow that omaha hotel was beautiful!
15:44 i love how this lady is just completely accepting that its haunted
first
tbh best youtuber
UPS TRUCK
maybe someone painted in bed💀
I read online the hotel Phillips opens in 1931 and it was bombed 2 times and 763 people died inside and 5 were in 511 💀💀💀💀
2.1m views, 100k likes after 11 hrs? Damn.
You look like cg5 without glasses

Honestly how do you do these on your own?! 🫣
That stud finder joke caught me so off guard
MMMMMMMAAAAAAKKKKKKEEEEEEEEE JOYRIDE KOSHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE JJJJJJJJJJJJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE KKKKKKKKKKKKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR MAKE JOYRIDE KOSHER PLEASE

The only thing that would have made this video better is if you watched all of the Ghostbusters movies instead of Kung Fu Panda....one star
YESSS LETS GO BABYYYY
✨Jammy Time✨
Why’d you come to abq you came to the worst city and hotel 😂
That guard was mad
Yo I love your videos and your the best vlogger

Ryan!
The haunted one is literally like ahs hotel
10:52 cause thats what happenes when you BUY an hotel room
Is anyone talking about they said have a good one at the same exact time 4:33
Why dont you tell us how much the tips are for the dash? Are you getting special treatment?
Ryan is so invested in his business that he literally sleep talks about his candy
Howdey 😂😂😂😂😂
✨Jammy Time✨ 5:44
:)
Ryan should stay at the Cecil hotel
“I’m out of sour strips😭”
The Philips hotel be like
the staff are probably nice cuz they know u r an influencer
The last candy is gummy bears and the place where he is selling it is fresh market
i went to omaha nebraska to go to the omaha zoo and the hotel was ausome
pigeon in the background lol at the start
(like and sub)
There's definitely a handsome dude at the next video
Ryan, please respond to my comment I’m struggling And it would really make my day
2.1 million views in 11 hours, he fell off
19:48 naw man by then you need to call ghostbusters..
go to o block next
The fact that my name is also Ryan, and I’m also lactose intolerant😂
I’m outta shour shtrips
RYAN COME TO THE PHILIPPINES MOST LONGEST SANDBAR AND I WILL SHOW IT TO YOU IF WE MEET UP.
Help Im Rebekah 😔
Always the best part of my day when this goat uploads
2 MIL VIEWS IN 10HRS WHAT
I can tell you, that steak was 100% rare, not medium rare, and nowhere near medium. Personally that works for me, but not what you ordered. On the other hand, I am pretty sure they upgraded your room, places will do that if they want a good impression to be made, or you have VIP status. Anyhow, thanks for the reviews.
RYAN!! BE CAREFUL OF BEDBUGS!!!!!
I have been to one of these
I live not far from Albuquerque!
jammy time got died so funny every time I put my pajamas on I’m gonna remember that😂
Wait when did bro come to Missouri😂
how could you not watch kung fu panda.. it is pure gold </3
Let’s go I’ve been waiting for one of these!
Ryan, if you are reading this, you should do a video dedicated to reviewing haunted hotels like the Stanley hotel and the Cecil hotel.
goes to bed in jammies, wakes up topless
I hate bed stains on hotel beds
can u pls go stay at hotel cecil j for jokes and not for the ghosts 🤪🫣🤭👀😋🫣💀🥰😫💀😎🧐✨👋🏻🥹
I got this video yesterday but I was too lazy… Could have gotten my below 1k views spot…
What happen with the security guard Ryan
2Mbps is "2 Mega bits per second"  There are 8 bits (b) per byte (B).  2Mbps = 0.25 MBps  So, if your file to download is 1GB and you have 2Mbps bandwidth, it will take 1hr and 7 minutes. If you had 2MBps as you had said, a 1GB file download would take about 8 minutes.
w
20:03.
made me want to watch king fu panda now
if you search "hotel p" the first prediction you see is "hotel Phillips 511 and hotel Phillips room 511."
Can I be in a video
Omg I saw the joyride at uncle Giuseppe’s
So many bot comments
Ryan, You should do more haunted hotels tho, that part of the bud was soo fun
Motel 6 is cheating lol
18:15 Why’d you leave AN FX3 outside your door lol
Bro is just so socially awkward i can't 😭
Wow. ERTs comment wad about like everything. He was basically unhappy with the world. 😂
btw you need a orange flavor
14:58 SCP-789-J?
He’s going to start needing a name alias for these reviews or they’re always going to put him in their best rooms 😂
10:56 you should have cgi'd a gorilla in the shower ( a tribute to the hotel review on your first 1 star hotel video )
When Ryan showed us his ghost hunting toys I instantly saw that he had a stud finder and wondered if he bought it by accident instead of an EMF detector and I was curious to see where this would all lead!!🤔
GAWD DAMN, I READ THE SUPER LONG REVIEW AND GOSH MAN. THAT IS CRAZYYYYY
Ryan, I know you did this hunted hotel for fun but I triple dog dare you to spend 24h on the most hunted hotel in the world, the Queen Mary or you have to give me 3 years supply of joyride you have intill April 13 2025. but you have to shout me out when you make that video. When you do also you have to explore the ship and go in the most hunted room of the ship enjoy! 😄 (P.S Haley has to come to or you fail😊.)
Ryan is the kind of guy that would stay underwater in the submarine for three days…
Needa hit some hotels that are out in the sticks
I like how thorough you are in your videos! Have you considered 1 star cruise ship reviews?
buddy you're getting canceled.
Ryan, do not go to Detriot. You will be murdered at some point. I'm from Michigan and I would know.
THERE IS BULLET HOLE??  The story in that room must be crazy.
11:05 LMAO the breast milk comment 😭😭😭
Bro tryhan you are something else for trying out the one star review places. 😶
I feel so disrespected because my name is Diego😭
When ryan realized the the "ghost tool" is meant for detecting wood in the walls😂lmao
i just watched this and i saw toilet was hunted that was my toilet aftet i shit💀
According to the reviews missouri is now misery
Joyride on shark tank?
I love the music when he is travelling
TEST MY BEDROOM NEXT
Ryan never seizes to amaze me and make me laugh like when he thought a stud detector was a ghost detector :)
I stayed at that Motel 6 in New Mexico and it had bedbugs
we hanging up some pictures in the motel with that stud finder
I need the UHh  sound after the rating comes on again plz
ryan learns about studs
Not Ryan using a stud finder as an “EMF” 😹😹😹
RYAN I look up to you and wish to be like you one day!
Ryan should start staying in an hunted hotels or house, that with be awesome
Bros trying to write a sa
I saw your candy at Walmart, I bought it.😋👍
Repent of your sins and believe in Jesus
the way that the security guard sighed was so funny
W VANITY Btw isnt it sus that Ryan got room 511 after that chat (i think it was on purpose)
You could rate anything at all and we would still watch it,. You know why Ryan? Your character!!! You’re amazing you lovely lovely human being I just want to cuddle you ❤
Try Boise Budget Inn next time - I’ve travelled all around the world many times and that was one place where the reviews actually scared me off and I ended up at a Hilton instead. Would like to know if that was justified.
Where is the review on Albuquerque motel?
Vanity sound so fine
is no one gonna talk about how he did 5 pull ups?
Go to Polynesian ocean front hotel in Myrtle Beach South Carolina
"Let's see if there's any breast milk in the fridge"  *previous hotel room rating flashbacks*
I almost bought bitcoin in 2011 😂😂
U FORGOT REBECCA
Biggest thing I learn from this guy is alot of reviews are BS..... why so many bad reviews happen that make no sense? Idk
day two of asking ryan trahan to make a limited joyride one penny flavor
Not Ryan using a stud finder for ghost hunting lol ❤
The cockroaches are not the flying kind😂😂 2:17
7:22 immediatly akward face.
The most honest YouTuber. He seems like he would not have any outakes. Stay happy, stay an awkwardly social curious child. 😊
This test is rated R.
Love the review of the 'haunted' hotel (21:21) God will always keep us safe! & our blue pajamas too!
I accept the trade thank you.. ONLY IF you share a cookie with me
you should try living in o-block for a week, very nice place.
I LOVE RYAN TRAHAN
Imagine the hair in the drain
Ryan da goat
4:42 did anyone else see the shadow moving on the chair. I think the hotel is haunted.
I’m out of sour strips 🗣️🗣️
The first one looks like the one where windy comes from breaking bad
ups truck!!!
I live in Mongolia So that candy is gonna be my country I don't know but I are you still with your videos all the time
Hey Ryan Trahan I have a question. What airlines did you go on to fly across over to the other states to stay in the hotels?
beautiful antscanada reference at 11:30
Walmart online app is selling Joyride gummy bears and gummy worms.
Hi Ryan! That is all.
Why do you have 2 Nintendo switches?
The last hotel was quite nice the ratings are pretty rude😊
IM IN A KANSAS CITY, MO HOTEL RIGHT NOW
The thing from the third hotel is what we call wires because its a device that scans for electric energy its what ghosts aparently comunicate through
Do an international one!!!
try  clown motel
Hi
i wish i had joy ride 😢
Jammy time in the cinema sounds like a vibe 😂
I ordered you sour strips, and it was super good. 10-10 would recommend!!
Vanity 100% gave you room 511 after you told her you were there because the hotel was haunted
Goes to bed with jammy's wakes up with at least no jammy top? does Ryan really like jammy's? sus. 😁
Ryan my name is Diego 😂
I love ur videos! Keep it up!
Kung fu panda 🐼 😂

You were in Omaha twice and I missed you both times. 😔
Cool vid
i wish you would be honest bruh, that first one definitely isn’t a five star bro
My mom saw joyride in the store already, how is that?
I wait for the day he gets a hotel so bad he can't stay
He probably just reviews these hotels and stays in another one over night
Video idea  Go on the worst rated planes ever (sorry)
Ryan best video ever
man i feel happy every time ryan post
as someone who lives right outside of detroit i was so shook when i saw you stay there. ive been here so many times
The 1st one is a motel not a hotel sir🤓☝🏾
WHERE IS THE PLACE IM TRYING TO GO THERE AT ROOM 2004
i cant believe i just read ert's review
Wow I have never seen a hotel room with a second floor o.O
I’m confused because many of the overall hotel reviews you show are more than 1 star.
14:10 "UPS TRUUUUUUCKKK" 🦅🦅🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
I can’t believe Ryan risked his life for us by going to Detroit 😭
Pls spend the night at the conjuring house
Very fun
Ryan needs to explore haunted locations next 😊
😂😂😂 😂 😂😂😂 😂 😂😂😂
Jesus loves you ♥️♥️♥️
Bruh again

2:38 Didn't realise Ryan's chin is so BIG
jammy time
The sleep talking was my favorite part of the video 🤣
is ryan going to sell joyride at sobeys cause I wan't to get one
He sounds tired
I was driving on the road and saw the first hotel logo 6 but I’m in West Virginia
I am deathly sick oof. Ryan always makes me laugh though so this had made me feel better! Thank you very much Ryan!
The accents he makes for every review is so funny 🤣🤣🤣
the fact that  his profile was the 2d video
I went there to see my dad
Ngl our internet AT BEST is 3 mbps so I could def live here if it was a bit bigger cuz we have 2 houses anyway
jammy time!1!1!!1!1!1!1!11!!
how was the weather when you got to Michigan? i live there and the weather is on and off like warm one day and cold the next.
CAN U SELL IT IN AUSTRALIAAA
I feel like the last hotel definitely recognised Ryan’s name & gave him a free upgrade!
WAIT! You own Joyride? bro. That's epic. I love your stuff.
29:49 no
bro pulled out a stud finder💀💀
You finally came to Kansas City
WHAT DID THE SECURITY GUARD TELL YOU DONT EDGE ME WITH*INHALE..EXHALES* I NEED TO KNOW RYAN

Ryan when is the penny series 2024 gonna be out??
E.R.T. done wrote a whole essay lol
yo, Vanity is a viiiiiiibe!
Back in ABQ 😭
118$ =fairly inexpensive? Ok bro
The studfinder joke was the best part of the video
Go Ryan
Bro is hooked on 1 star things but I think you should test 1 star cruise ships 😉
how much does these videos cost ?
You should visit one or something in west Virginia!!
I also live in aba and we're top for crime in the USA (go to Sandia or Route 66 NOT OUR MOTELS)
do day 1 of surviving on 1 penny pls
ok ryan ya awesome and love your vids. However magnolia is 4.5 everwhere i looked naughty you. But still loved the vid .
i bought your strips at a local amc have you already said that to the public or am i just lucky ?
The fact you haven’t seen kun fu panda is concerning you clearly had no child hood
I live in Kansas city Missouri and seeing my city in one of Ryans videos is amazing
If ur not gay ur allowed to like this comment
Ryan u should test 5 star hotels and try to rate them 1 star
bro Ryan that was a stud finder
MAKE THIS A MEME/QUOTE 19:34
when you said detroit mi i legit thought it was gonna be the leland hotel lmao 100% the worst hotel ive ever stayed in. half of the rooms are doors with regular keyholes because peeople are living there which really wouldnt be that weird but theyre on the same floors as the regular hotel rooms, so onee side of the hallway is guests and the other half are tenants. the tv didnt work, the outlets didnt work, and the heat was on full blast. they sent up the bell boy to "fix" the heat in our room but when he came we realized he was the same man selling bootleg dvds in front of the hotel so we were like ???? thee bathroom smelled like bacon. anyway because the outlets didnt work and everything just kinda looked dirty we decided to leave and get our money back and go stay somewhere else. that was many years ago i wonder if its still like that. that last hotel you stayed in is so insanely nice??? it looks bigger than my house 😂
Missouri is great
Shout out to Omaha, Nebraska & Magnolia!!! 🙌🔥💯
Bro has turned into a person who records themselves sleep and then review it....
This comment will never get 6 likes
bro wtf i live in kansas city 💀
I found his candy in a Walmart store, if anyone is interested.
8:54 I think the kind of people who go there only leave one star reviews (because they're karens)
You should go 1 star hotels and eat at 1 star food places😅😊
Who didnt see someone in the minor bruh (9:56)
✨Jammy time ✨
In Omaha you got a "suite" not a room right ?
Bro just wanted to flex the fact that he bought Bitcoin in 2011
W video. Editing is getting SO GOOD Ryan. Hilarious! Keep it up.
I love your videos and mission to be positive... however, it is rather misleading to people who want to go there and trust the reviews for you to post a good review for an actual awful place. I love this, but am mixed.
Bullet holes 😭
✨Jammy Time✨
Did you listen to my comment???
21:13 he wanted to wake up at the most creepiest time  💀💀💀
Jammy time is absolutely iconic
If this is gonna be a series it would be my Favorite series in YouTube :D Love your 1 Star review Testing Videos No Matter if its a Hotel or whatever :)
Bro I got a 5 star hotel in Vietnam for 30$ with full kitchen Japanese toilet giant tv and gym+pool😂. Search up Taiyo hotel denang
24:24 DAYUM
I want this man to go to the Stanley hotel
Loud Flys!
26:27 TW: horrible dad joke
"I'm gonna play with my toys now" seems very weird out of context.
u should collab with sam and colby
Dude I loved your collab with hangtime
About 2 millions views in 9 hours damm bruh , good fukkin job !!! Really came a longgg way .
Ryan is the 1 star king making all places 5 stars. Keep the videos up Ryan!
Jack is the best
joyride to canada when tho
the stud finder😭😭
I really enjoy these 1-star testing videos. You are a legend, ryan.
Ryan I'm an ogre!
Spock got in the trash again got me laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the 1st hotel looks like an F
That security guard is the reason I have social anxiety lol
I can’t believe you got room 511 😮like omg that’s a miracle
also, this guy loves apple like a lot
Ryan must spend at least 10% of his life on airplanes
Ya know, idk what those people are talking about. I’ve never even been to that hotel in Kansas City!
security guard getting pissed about the vending machine is hilarious
Imagine not seeing the Kong fu panda movie.
OMG ROOM 2004
I see some blue meth there 🤪😱
try 1-star hospitals                 (⓿_⓿)
I saw your new candy at an AMC theater and I tried it and it was so good. Great job Ryan.
The desk lady OMG you"hey I herd this hotel is hunted is it true" desk lady " yes it is"
I’m so exited to try joyride!
Hmmm...
If you saw this before 10 hours
11:42 lmaooo
When he saw the bullet hool he’s like extra peephole
I love ryans videos i wish i could watch them with my friends i dont have
2 of these places got a gorillaz song named after them 🗣
Bro the plumbing review
I really would love to try Joyride, but I live in Australia, is there any chance you would supply to stockists in Australia??
Are we just going to brush over the fact that Ryan is (trying?) to do 100 pull ups a day??? Does he secretly have a sleeper build…
that jungle music goes hard
this was the first time that omaha has impressed someone
Ryan i may look like a cat i may  be a bad YouTuber but you can make anyone's day
... I am scared
Ryan you should go to places that claim to be haunted and test if there haunted
he didn't look to mad tbh but everyone else "MY HOTEL WAS F***ING HAUNTED 🤬!!"
love to see ryan try some paranormal stuff
why don't you eat any fruits or vegetables? My moms worried about you.
ryan im genuinely thrilled everytime i see you posted something new, more support to you!!
Ryan i donno why whenever your new video pops up you are always on my youtube recomendation
as someone from MO its not that bad ive lived here for like 10 years
Can you do testing 5 star hotels again
Ryan’s videos bring me so much joy! 🥹
26:02 I love how I know exactly where you are in that picture. I live in omaha and I absolutely love it. And you should move here cause uh yeah
How did Ryan inhale all those fries after that steak that was insane
They probibly found 2 ants and there are never just 2 ants
is david still waiting for his food
That kung fu panda plush got me dieing😂😂😂
Don’t stay in Room 1408
They were know you gonna coming to their hotel and they were suddenly make you like a vvvvvvip guest
THE LONGER THE VIDEO THE BETTTERRRR
Cool Ryan. Please respond. You owe me. Remember…
bro eats out every day and weighs like 90 lbs it's wild
kung fu panda loding for like so long (:
It would be interesting if you bring a black light with you when staying at these 1 star rating accommodations to see what else you might find ?
PLEASE do a "Haunted hotel" tour. 😤
you spelt Albuquerque wrong
I am really sorry to tell you but that’s a stud finder not a ghost finder 19:06
POV those random reviews,    Cool, One star ⭐️
The music bangs
I never go to motel 6 after bed bugs
Hi
the creepy room full of futons that hotel is 100% haunted 😂
First hotel I think it's from breaking bad
yo hotel 3 felt like a Sam and Colby video
I love these vids but wish Ryan can spend more time with Hayley 💕
“When the guy, or ghost,” GrEg CoMeS iN…
12:12  okay but imma need to know what happened after that guy sighed at you
why did that panda look like that 28:48
wearing your jammies and eating cookies with milk that's totally raid I wish I was there in that hotel then I'll be enjoying some cookies and drinking some milk. milk and cookies!!!!! 💙🍪✊that was a nice hotel.
You have to go to the days inn in roseburg. Beyond the worst hotel I’ve ever been to. Had blood on the “clean towels” mold in the shower and walls, freaked of cigarette smell and screaming weirdos in the lot all night. They said they “upgraded my king suite to a two twin Bed room”
According to CSI, the room next to the exit is where people get murdered.
Good video. Would be cool to get some black light action. Another Dirty Room series taught me the TV remote is the dirtiest thing in a hotel.
I want that pullup thingy
If you ever do another one of these you should check out the Aloft hotel near the Charleston airport in South Carolina! It's uhm... really bad.... The staff was pretty rude when I was there and we had to change rooms three times because of mold, broken doors, and even more mold.
I knew nothing would’ve happened to you at room 511 Because almighty God protected you from evil if it actually was haunted 🙏🏾🔥
I can’t believe he lied, he said 1-star only my ass, there was many other star like 3
Are the joyride coming in the uk?
hi
This is one of those youtube videos that... you find every once in a while and it is just AMAZING. Didnt want this video to end
Great vid
If a women did this series she’d be dead within the first two hotels 😶
Ryan I can’t believe u we’re like 20 minutes from my  house in MO 😂
If you sell thos in turkey, u'll make my brothers birthday 1000000times better😢 Say a101, bim, şok, or trendyol, n11, just somewhere near me!  I've never tried them before, nor my brother, who's one of your biggest fans❤
22:43 " thats a lotta words. "    " too bad i ain't reading 'em. " 🚬😎
Omg dude at exactly 18:55 in the video dude that checks for metal in the wall it’s used when people mount things like tvs on walls ughhhhh u trigger me me dude
GO TO CECIL HOTEL NEXT
Was that an Easter egg that Ryan is going to be on Shark Tank? Because that would be AWESOME 😎
I have vacationed to Omaha before and I have stayed in that hotel before, pretty nice. Also that toy store is big and cool.
Hi
Is nobody gonna talk about the last one? Bro u we’re definitely lucky especially when the worker said “oh thats a good one 😊”
UPS TRUCK phgh
Omg when I went to motel 6 in Canada IT WAS AMAZING
22:44 the review☠️☠️☠️
@Ryan are the joyride avaliable in australia?
pfft im John M
27:11 Ryan you asked for medium, if you did do you over thinking to much that you forgot , or i don't pay attention
Family loves watching these videos! Thanks for the good times and laughs! Looking forward to the next one! We also LOVE your Penny Series!! When will JoyRide be back in stock, the kids have been really wanting to try them!
Balls
Hiiii
what pull up door frame gear is that and where do i get it? lol
The"haunted" hotel has plumbing and electrical problems.
"I'm sorry did the ghost wipe your butt?!" 😂🤣
Bought 4 flavors of joyride at REI recently, not bad, but unimpressive.  2 ⭐️'s
that yellow thing that beeps on the wall tells you is theirs a support beem there my dad is a construction  worker for his business and he uses that to check if there is support in certin areas
I love you, man, but PLEASE learn to really check for bed bugs. I got them as a kid, and they legit ruin you. They don't discriminate between classes, are common, easy to catch, and VERY hard to get rid of. No joke
I live in Kansas City and have passed the hotel many times
Bullet holes 💀
nice boy
I no
omg my countrys flag was in a ryan trahan vid!
Ryan:is it haunted?  Desk lady: IT SURE IS😄😄
that yellow thing that beeps on the wall tells you is theirs a support beem there my dad is a construction  worker for his business and he uses that to check if there is support in certin areas
I was stationed in ABQ for 3 years. Im glad Ryan made it ount safely 😅
27:57 king fu panda moved just look 27:59
Amazing videos keep up the great work
I want that cowboy hat
Every time I try to but the sour strips they are out of stock I need to buy some
I've been grabbing joyride gummy bears and gummy worms from my local grocery store, but 9 bucks a bag is insane
THIS IS WHERE PREM FN LIVES
Aint no way youve been in albuquerque twice now. And i missed you both times. Ridiculous of me.
0:50: JASON G?!?!?!?!
Awesome
2 Chronicles 7:14 "if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
bro changed his thumbnail again lol
I dare you to go to the conjuring house :-D
The 2nd hotel is the literal doors hotel
I GHOST
yo Unspeakable said he would love to try joyride and he wants to know if you could send him some
211 is code for robbery... Just sayin
You should do a video where you have to leave a five star review on haunted hotels
E potato
Ryan is so genuine and deserves all of the success
Let’s go new video
Where are some stores you can buy joyride??
16:00 elevator doors do in fact open on their own, sometimes. this is a maintenance feature to ensure the door is working. it happens with almost every elevator, twice a day.
I love jammy time. Lol
Toilet was haunted 5 stars
pls make more vids i love them too much pls post more
Not the 150$ steak tho
Omg I can’t be believe he went to Detroit
" if theres any noises" *Ryan snoring*
If u didn’t come from TikTok you can like this comment
Damn is that a Netflix series?😂❤️
The move the camera away from the blue chair 😂
You mean megabits not megabytes.
I sow a move in the back rond
Ryan my man 3am is the Devils hour
Jammy time 😊
1.8 million views in 8 hours? This is our world now?
How did you service the ghost!?
Ryan, I love you brother, but studs in walls run up and down not left to ride and are 16” apart not 18”. 😂 ❤ Never stop making videos! Our family loves watching them all!
Howdy Ryan! 🤠
Oh this is a stud finder had me dead
Benign calcification, damn barz.
The "I tested" videos are some of the best on the internet.
You should of asked the ghost if it wanted to watch kung fu panda
7:20 it was so hard to read that it took me multiple tries
16:17 I think that may cuz here problems at work
That looks like Kung Fu Piracy ryan, are you a pirate? :O
i knew it that he will watch kung fu panda 4 in this video
You where never in Kansas 👀😂 @24:45
someone check on that carpet
Ert is a english teacher holy moly.
I live near Omaha Nebraska
Yes
1:50 the pigeon just chilling in the back lol.
Look I’m just here to say I’ve ate chipotle chicken rice and cheese burritos for the last week (Ryan’s favorite) slapping the burrito every time. The only downside is I’ve crapped myself every time  before finishing the burrito….how do you do it Ryan?!
You should do "Reviewing the most haunted hotels!!"
Next time test 5 star and see if they are a scam
"I was protected by both the Spirit of God and my light blue pajamas" 😂😂
28:08 is a w trade
the yellow ghost detector is a wooden stud detector ,bruh
I live in Kansas City and knowing that Ryan was in my home made me float into heaven thanks dude😀
"Oh this is a stud finder!"
This guy always entertains me.
(comment wouldnt post 5 hours ago) DANG YOU WERE IN DETROIT? IM IN LIVONIA MAN I COULDA VISITED DETROIT AND SAW U LMAO
So Ryan I know the chances of you being this is 0.000001% but I have advice for joyride. first is that I wanted to buy Joyride, but my parents won't let me. Secondly, I think you should make Joyride cheaper so it is more excessable. Like many healthy brands are super expensive so you should probably make them a little cheaper. also your content is so good (I binged the entire penny series)
Don’t make fun of people by doing an accent
Can’t have nothing in Detroit tho
Try canadian hotels? 🇨🇦
being from abq, i was actually concerned for ryan at that motel 6...
1,771,776 MILLION VIEWS IN 8 HOURS THATS INSANE MAN KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!
Wait a minute I was Rebeca
Love the vids keep it up
Vanity I think that’s just how an elevator works🤫🤫🧏🏼🧏🏼
Ryan should definitely confront his fear of the paranormal and spend nights in haunted houses
PLEASE REDO THE PENNY SERIES THIS SUMMER AGAIN
2Mbps is megabits which is smaller than a megabyte making that wifi offensively slow
do some poland hotels
Cheese
5 stars on the vid btw
17:57 I GOT FLASHBANGED
you know, i just realized Ryan always has a side goal, this time he wants to finish the kung fu panda movies while testing out these 1-star hotels
Ryan please answer my DM😭
You should go to Cecil hotel
Where is the "I survived on 0.01$ for 30 days (again)"? 🤨
can't even have a good hotel in detroit
Yello
Of content but when are the new candy’s coming cuz joyrides are goated
Bro is using a stud detector to find ghosts in the walls.
Imagine a world full of people just like Ryan
Plz try the New Haven inn / it’s at New Haven Connecticut
Ryan’s just like a vibe 10 stars ⭐️
Ryan, can u make the retailers heb
Title “I tested 1 star hotels” 1st place he goes is a MOTEL. MOTEL 6. It’s in the name lol
1,784,141 views in 8 hours Ryan rlly fell off
can you make a joyride store at AB edmonton at the hazeldean area PLEASE
As an Omaha resident I would like to inform your that the hotel did not perform up to our lavish standards and fancy life style.
I smell cookies 😂😂😂😂
Please make a video of the terrarium/mini ecosystem @ryantrahan
22:43 Who else actually paused to read it  I have way to much time 😂😂😂
Maybe do more one star restaurants?
Imagine they have specific rooms for Ryan and are only nice to Ryan so that they can get a five star
I love how Ryan finds a way to make something so scary yet so funny.
You know right off the bat it’s motel 6, it’s gonna be bad 😂
The second they stock anywhere I DONT CARE HOW FAR IT IS I AM BUYING IT
🐒
You should go to a bad hotel in Grand Rapids Michigan🤫
The first one is a horror game material
11:05 *flashbacks to the previous 1-star hotel review*
Bro that music makes me dance
11:58 @bli
Diego was my class mate but he went. Back to Mexico and the city you are in
tbh vanity sounded like a nice person.
As a born and raised New Mexician I can definitely give you credit for even going to ABQ. I have not been back to ABQ for 5 five years now I avoid at all costs.
I DARE you to go to the El Camino Motel   in Tallahassee Florida!!😂😂😂😂
Best quote “value is value” ✌🏽✌🏽
Watch 1408 lol. Scary
Did anyone else pause and read that huge review from E.R.T about that last hotel? XD
video idea: day in the life of ryan
HE CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
15:42 ryan: "i heard it was haunted" desk lady: "are you serious" ryan: "is that true" desk lady: "IT SURE IIS! 😃" 21:07 im outta sour strips 😩
Look's like Ray got some competition... 8:45
Brukkin babd
That toilet wanted to be skibibi
22:59 Beat goes crazy. Ryan has good taste, I really want to see somebody rap over this.
Albuquerque is crazy. I stayed at a hotel there and people were smoking meth outside right in front of me on my way to my car and the Waffle House next door was open the night I arrived. Broken into and a crime scene by morning.
Bro used a stud detecter 😂
Who thinks Ryan is going to go on shark tank and try and show them joy ride?
Ryan you are my absolute favourite YouTuber and I love your videos so much ❤❤
Yoo what pull up gear is that?? Looks fire
We need more jammy times ❤❤❤
Thank you for your wholesome videos
My watch has been intercepted by Iranian missile attack  Regards from 🇮🇱
Kung Fu panda 1 is ok Kung Fu panda 2 is amazing!! Kung Fu panda 3 is great  Have not seen the fourth one 😢
Eppely airport
Hi

Love to see us omahians get the love
I looked up motel 6 and apparently someone was killed a month ago there…
What if the ghost joined you while watching kung fu panda 3 😂
try the super 8 in grand forks, north dakota
Hotel Phillips is straight out Luigi's Mansion 3
any chance that Joyride will go overseas?
which kung fu panda movie was your favirote and what was your favirote part in that movie
29:07 panda
I accept your trade offer
damn Ryan got that bod
22:43 who actually pause to look at it
fun fact: the thumbnail originally said "room 13 is haunted"
is Dr Phill your grampa yet??
You should go to the Stanley hotel
I accept your offer
Thought he was eating eddie’s 😂😂
Here
17:49 that jammy time transition XD
Amazing thumbnail
Here
jammyy time!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
I'm out of sour strippes        hehe
Its so hilarious to me that he mention panda express and kung fu panda. I always slip up & say Kung fu chicken instead of panda express. I even stare out trying to remember the actual name. My brain connects the panda to kung fu panda, and the chicken to their orange chicken😭
I’m from Iowa right by Omaha I go to guitar practice their that’s so cool you went there
HEY I LIVE IN MISSOURI
That first hotel looks like a hotel you would see in gta5
Part 3!!!
17:10 he needs Sam and Colby lmao
Cool
The horses are galloping at precarious speeds, perhaps i may arrive soon
lol Ryan - The Hotel Phillips is not 1⭐️ they have 4⭐️ and 2,000+ google reviews - the Motel 6 though, definitely.
maybe the burn marks are from dr@g$ from them smoking them 😐
ryan please god u need to make a BANANA candy!!
12:07 made me lol so hard
Broooooooo
MISSOURI MENTION??
This is my favorite series on YouTube. Good vibes, always bringing positivity, brings my stress down. Five stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Great video Ryan keep up the amazing work! :)
ryan is lucky to be alive after that motel 6
Wow 3/4 candies revealed. I was really loving the shorts with the candy reveal. Cracks me up! Please make a shirt for the 3rd candy… it was a letdown to see it just barely in the video, no hype?
jammy time
panda express sucks
I hope you go my place
Bro to to cecil hotel
Why Panda Express? “I can’t see” 😭😭😭
RYAN I need that pull up thing, pls tell me name.
The last hotel room is like a house for $300.
Get rid of the Hat. It was Mildly cute years ago but now it’s just creepy.
I take the award of the longest timed comment 29:48

4:11 "I couldn't find him, so I just ordered some dinner-" LOL THE TOPIC CHANGE
My family and I were recently passing through Nebraska and went to Runza 3 times within 18 hours. Surprised you didn’t go while in Omaha
29:49 29:50 59:59
Next video idea visit the most haunted hotels
You going to low rated hotels in places like Albuquerque & Detroit had me so nervous the entire video.
very cool
I love the content and it is really funny to the point where if you make a video about paint dry it would make me laugh keep it up
omg i’ve driven by hotel phillips my entire life there used to be rumors it was super haunted
69,420:59
The security guard part was so funny lol
I miss the penny challenge. Those where the good days.
If you did not come from google giggles you are allowed to like…
I’d be a-ok if you made this a regular series
Watching your videos is always a treat. Go Ryan!
The best part was when you were talking in your sleep
i like ur phone case
FUCK this is 7 hour agoo so it was 1 am💀💀 in aust
Hes back
I tested 1-3 star hotels
I'm in the business. Your Motel 6 sheets weren't changed.

The Detroit Michigan hotel has been though some stuff… I live in Michigan and I drove through there before
Awesome, go to Madisonville Tennessee and try Benton's... You will probably like it...
22:44 I read it. Not rly about hotel
“Living organism” is very … mm.
If Ryan replies I’ll buy 1000 packs of joyride
next time you come to Michigan please bring me candy!
Ryan in 10 years-I tested broken space ships (again)
Toys 🤣
Do u even actually write the reviews … because I can’t find a single review from you 💀
No way bro actually came to Detroit 💀
Hi

"toilet was haunted"  mine too, my turds are often burgled when i check teh bowl.
Jammies are some of the drippiest articles of clothing to exist
For my home city Albuquerque, Ryan you should have done your research on our city
Bro the transition at 17:46
You’re telling me this video isn’t sponsored by kung fu panda
That review by Joe P was so Savage Holy crap
0:01 nice chess strats :)
I was actually surprised when you explained how studs work in detail then pulled the curtain and said "oh it's a stud finder". Lots of clickbaiters would've just went with it. Cheers.
the Detroit one is scary...
11:04 only true fans would understand this 😂😂😂
Every body him until ryan and his friends pull up in the jammys
best content ever in history
1.5 mil views in less than 7 hours is crazy! U deserve it bro 🎉

20:50, You sleep talk!😃
Bro is running out of ideas 🤦‍♂️
RAHHHH NEBRASKA MENTIONED🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Amazing videos
Thank you for these amazing videos they are great ideas
You should make a video where you go to 5 star hotels, but you have to leave a 1 star review   and you can't lie.
He's going on shark tank calling it now haha
Not satisfied with the testing of all the reviews. Especially the security guard
I’m not reading my own time that is too long. That’s just a waste of time.
Ryan please make another Pokémon video
0:32 upside down looks like fortnite logo
Are your sour strips going to be able to be brought in new zealand?
VANITY SEEMS SO SWEET LOL
Don’t underestimate Albuquerque. It’s good city trust😂😂😂
OMAHA
Really got the breaking bad vibes with the first one.
RYAN YOU WERE IN MY HOME TOWN FOR LIKE A THRID OR SECKND TIME(I’m in Michigan but not in Detroit)

8:25 I don't think it was 8 months ago it was like  more than a year ago
YOU WHERE IN KC MO THATS WHERE I LIVE
Yas
Tested one star hotels, yet only one of the hotels actually had one star? Are you running out of ideas?
17:46, I feel like I'm watching a thirst trap with that transition🫣

Me personally. I could never.
E.r.t really wrote a whole essay on the hotel😂
Do 1star air bnbs!
🍿🤏😯
If anyone can make me laugh, it's Ryan. From his sarcasm to silliness to friendliness to twists and turns, his videos make me happy.
RYAN, you need to go to Hotel Alex Johnson in Rapid City, SD
Albuquerque local here! Reminder that our state is number one for crime and number fifty one for education. Please be safe and aware of your surroundings when you come here (and maybe just avoid the motels).
The haunted hotel partfeels like the nancy drew computer games 😂 But absolutely love these vdeos pls make more ❤️
The fence was opened by super strength haha😂
test 5 star hotels you deserve something nice but this time you are forced to write a one-star review

It was my fav video
Come to elkhart Indiana or south bend Indiana !!!
you should do hotels where they do breakfast
I knew I shouldn’t have taken that left toin at Albakoiky
You should go to the most haunted hotels in America and give them honest 5 star reviews
22:46 Casey Neistat was in Nebraska. Cant convince me otherwise.
You should’ve asked the DoorDash guy what he thought of the neighborhood you’re in Lol
Bruh went to the cinema in his pj,s😂
WHY IS IT 7 HOURS AGO?
“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011”  Got me dying
Ryan do you ever think you’ll collaborate with Sam and Colby?? I’m sure they’d be happy to! :)

You should have bought the cheapest rooms. The last one seemed like their best room!
The most recent example of a stud
Can't believe he used a stud finder to find ghosts. He probably thought the ghosts were hiding in the walls🤣

I literally stayed at that first motel for only a night, and for me the room smelt like smoke, and this video is true, pretty weird vibes but overall not bad
No, the most confusing thing about that hotel is that there is a Canada flag and the USA flag.
I actually went somewhere scary today. It was not scary it was a little scary it was haunted

I got the rings for your candy and they weren't good. I got the sour strips but in my package there wasn't any sour.  - review written 3 stars. lol XD
Bruh I lost my doo-doo when Ryan said, “maybe someone was painting in bed?”
You are a very succseful young man Congrats and well done.
Uh, what hapened about the guard? (Im talking about when you asked them where the vending machine was.)
You’d never think you’d attract and audience member like myself but I jump with joy when I see you release a new video , keep up the great work king
Go to haunted hotels, a lot in Pennsylvania
yayya

Some say that you can still hear Haley in the distance shocked to her very breath that *Ryan said he had been living alone for the past 6 years…. THEN WHO WAS THE OTHER HALEY, AND WHY DID HE SAY “ONE OF MY WIVES” lmao XD ;D 💀💀💀*
I have that same electromagnetic reader and its loud af

Ryan: Coming to a store near you! Me living in Australia: 😢
Easily my favorite YouTuber
if you didn’t watch the first video the second hotel fridge check for breast milk would be so confusing
Just glossed over the fact that he played shuffleboard with Danny Gonzalez
U spelled Albuquerque wrong. It hurts because I live here and the fact that ur editor can't look it up so they can spell it is sad
It's said that the room 913 on Hotel phillips is practically active where guests often hear rattling sounds And room 1513 has such a sad story of a woman being shot by her lover assumably. She haunts the room crying in distress and her face is donned with red hair and flashing eyes. I'd visit with ghost hunting stuff if I'm honest !
I need sour strips!!! I have been waiting for a two weeks but no candy! Please I need It!
Netflix movie
Hi Ryan pls notice me
it's ✨JAMMY TIME✨
That's so crazy I live in Kansas City and I drive by hotel Phillips all the time now I'm definitely going to have to stay there..... Hope you got some barbecue while you're here and had a good time
I literally started dying when you used the stud finder lmfao 😂
The next time you go to Nebraska hit me up please we should 100% meet up
You should stay in the Cecil hotel - everyone like this comment for him ❤
DUDEEEEEEEE 2004 is blowing the other hotel rooms out of the water!
I went to a motel 6 a few years ago and the second night I came home at around 12 and a guy was pearing down at me and kept staring at me. Ryan dont go back
OH MY GOSH, MY DAD WAS BORN IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA❤😂

Bro is going to room 1408 next 💀

"Benign calcifications, haunted toilets, and Rebecca."
I think the fact you were scared on the second hotel is the lie :)
11:08 the 20-30 Ants is crazy
Do one star hotels around the world
anyone else noticing the thumbnail of this video keeps changing?
You should make sour snakes
Try flip it and going to 5 star hotels and ratingn them 1 star instead. I recon it will be really funny with your personality being in a really posh place, and you being awkward ( plus good content for ya). Also the only way to give it a 1 star is if you nit pick it so much e,g your butler didnt handwash your feet or something crazy

You always know it will be a good day when Ryan Trahan posts a video 😊 literally my favorite youtuber
Try flip it and going to 5 star hotels and ratingn them 1 star instead. I recon it will be really funny with your personality being in a really posh place, and you being awkward ( plus good content for ya).

I love how Ryan has goals. Like Ryan is trying to work, sleep, make candy and make videos more!🤯🥹
Are there gonna be joyrides in lidl??????????
UPS TRUCK😂 best part
Now try all 5-star hotels but give a 1-star review.
Please fix your audio before uploading it’s so simple they are even ai tools that do that automatically for you
Today I saw joyride in dicks sporting goods ❤
im not knocking you but you have the widest head ive ever seen and i love it!
Some of these places genuinely seem like they don’t deserve such a bad reputation
Go to Dominican Republic 🇩🇴
get sam and colby in the missouri hotel
Try flip it and going to 5 star hotels and ratingn them 1 star instead.

I WANT MORE VANITY, bring her back.
1,306,963rd view
me when there isnt any breast milk in the fridge:☹😭😫
It’s simply liminal that’s why u will feel the weird feeling as if ur not in the reality and one of the reasons too is because the hallways looks completely different with diff colours compared to the lobby and the rooms which that will cause that feeling and I sometimes like it but not always cuz it could become creepy
So i found out why this hotel at 15:24 was haunted you see in the 511 there is 51 wich is a number from the are 51 and 913 has 13 in it wich is a number from the deman in room 1513 there is again 13 and 803 idk
If a guy like me comments on this video and nobody like then I’m the. Chosen one
I read the entire thing on the 3rd review
u know that when you click the wrong floor in an elevator it'll go down n open even if no ones in it...
Joride
I watched you receive panda express while eating panda express
511
my local REI has joy ride candy! I had the sour gummy bears
It’s not French fries BUT Belgium 🇧🇪 fries I will explain why if you want, French= is actually Belgium but its frenched and that means SLICED but its is from Belgium 🇧🇪
Hi
Hi
The fact hat I just went to watch king fu panda 4 is crazy 😮😮❤
In high school my friend and I rented a room at the nearby motel 6 and all was fine and great having a blast just hanging out then at 3 am someone was trying HARD TO GET IN THE ROOM banging kicking we hid behind the second bed and cried  ourselves to sleep .
Ryan that's not a juice stain that's apart of the painting lol ☠
I live in downtown Detroit Michigan
I cant be the only one that noticed the pigeon in 1:52 😂
I wonder who the ghost was…
lol
I would DEFINITELY not mind taking my pet humans to the last hotel you've visited Ryan 😍!  It looks better than most hotels here to be honest... WHAT it even looks live you've rented an entire condo 😂. Could fly through that hotel room all day long 🥰🕊🪶
Its pretty crazy that his meal cost half the cost of his room
H H H H H HILL 😅
I was about to say is nobody gonna tell Ryan that he was using a stud finder and the he said oh this is a stud finder
H H H H
LOL
I moved away from New Mexico 😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢 I miss my friends
Good guy.
Everybody was kung fu fighting, everyone going fast as lightning
DAMM THTA PASTA WITH CHICKEN
NO NOT AGAIN
The Detroit hotel is straight up a backrooms situation.
What was the best kung fu panda part?
most of the hotels you stayed at aren't 1 stars according to google review or yelp
bro ordered the best meal of all time ! Panda express!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should go to embers inn in Winnsboro, Louisiana
The third hotel reminds me of the kdrama Penthouse
Wait wait 😂😂😂😂  just  asking are you and infinite  twins  plz answer  😅😂
Bruh when he says o this is a stud finder😂 and I new it was a stud finder the whole time 😂
I Love your videos ❤😊
whats next your gonna tell me room 1408 is in hotel philips
We just have to wait for a hotel he goes to to actually be bad
RYAN! You should definitely do a collab with Sam and Colby
Honestly? That hotel staff being so happy saying the hotel is hunted is such a vibe 😂😂😂😂 love the energy
Am i the one one getting the Mandela effect on Ryan Trayhan name...                                                                                                      !                                                        Auto correct was correcting Trayhan to Trashcan..     I was definitely spelt with a 'Y'...
Yippppeeee
I live in Kansas city Missouri
I love Ryans videos and he always finds a way to make me laugh and find the good in everything (Just subscribed)
HOW IS BRO NOT DIE LOL
He went to my city 😮😮😊😊🎉🎉 (Omaha Nebraska) I’m a huge fan of this fan and his content
"khaaauugaugh.. subscribe khoooouuauge.." almost laughed but not very much
Most people go to hotels because they are traveling. Ryan travels because he’s going to hotels lol
I love it
My list of kung fu panda goes 3,4,1,2
😂😂😂 I almost bought Bitcoin in 2011💀5secound later… it was me
Can you do a WOW Airbnb video again
UPS TRUUUCK! Made me spit out my drink laughing
Ryan im ur fan :D
Detroit!!!

Ryan Im a huge fan a always love to see these hotels i have a video suggestion instead of you going to 1 star hotels you should got to 5 star hotels
11:04 what
Going to these places without disinfectant wipes and disposable bedding is brave 😭
That kung-fu panda toy is the cutest thing ever 😭 glad you survived to make it home for the movie!
:)
15:34 man reported walking into luigis mansion
Ryan where u using a stud finder lol
11:51 liminp
the yellow "thingy" is a stud finder
Love your shows your the only YouTube show I watch
Finaly New video I love Watching Your Videos Keep up the good Work

Diego’s my bf. Yes he is the best ❤😎
4:28
that detroit one was such a bait
Ryan could make a video about watching paint dry and it would still be entertaining 😂😂😂😂😂😂
if im a ghost and I see ryan's epic set up, im leavin him alone
Is there a Missouri City in Kansas? Just wondering.
If Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were based on true stories, a lot of episodes probably happened in that Albuquerque Motel 6.
9:57 liminal
27:36 how do you know? walmart doesnt exist in all countries if thats the store
In New Mexico
In the first hotel
Motel 6 Chicago near airport definitely 1 Star. It stunk of cigarette smoke. No option to swap room from staff. Air-conditioning not cleaned in a decade. Terrible experience. ⭐
When you were sleeping, I heard something from the other side of your door
9:45 BACKROOMS!?
MEDIUM STEAK?????? smh
2:17 he said so that’s good faster than a cheetah can run
18:49 LMAO this is gold
you made sour candy because you love sour candy so why don't you make coffee because you love coffee
29:42  if u found this comment u will die in the next 3 days
18:54 is he using a stud device
Ryan can u reply tot his I luv u
You should test 5 star hotels and “rate” them 1 star
Hey Ryan i know you won’t see this but you should visit bluestone, wales as it is a wonderful experience and I think you would enjoy it
Would be cool for you to do a comparison between a 1 star hotel, 2 star hotel 3 star hotel etc. And then rate them on how they actually were compared to their reviews : )
Wait, Omaha looks kinda cute!
YOU CANT GO TO OMAHA AND NOT GO TO THE ZOO!!!!
HOLY COW! 1 Mil+ in 6 hours, can't wait to watch!
amazing video like usual
Way are these places rated so bad they look nicer than eny lv stayed at
Every since I watched this video, Jammy time is now my favourite part of my night routine ❤
I think the problem of sold out sour stripes is RYAN cause he has it in his every video and he is eating it !!!!!!!! i didnt mean to hurt u😉. And also in every 1 star video of his will have a review which there will be a name of a staff and ryan will look for the staff which is pretty funny cause i woudn"t have minded it at all. And also did anyone read that E.R.T's review cause I ain't.
YAY more five star vids the best videos on this platform
Pov Ryan gets haunted bye a ghost Ryan hold on I got to finish kung-fu-panda
Dude came to my mf city and I didn’t even get the chance to know and say high I’m so mad
19:12 😂😂😂
Just reealized this was 5 hours ago lol love ur vids keep making them
Bro really said:  "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me." - Psalm 23:4   That motel 6 is crazyyy   🤣🤣🤣
ryan traqnhan i loveeeee  youuuuuuuuu   ughhhhhhh!!!~!!!!
Day 1 of trying Ryan to ❤ my comment
ryan plz im begging you to hit me up next time youre in omaha
I found joy ride rope things at home goods💀
You are one of my favorite people, enjoyed the video  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5:34 yes
When the staff says it's haunted. It's a gimmick, that's what they sell.
21:09 bro it’s like just him talking😂
Did you meet Patrick in Omaha? Apparently everyone in Omaha knows Patrick. (AJR reference no one will know this 😭)
Immediate like for "haunted toilet" lol
Did anybody else read E.R.T's whole review? 😂
As a person who also lives n abl motel 6’s r terrible my room got broken into
There is so much fiber in joyride     I'm pooping rn😂😂😂
GTA V💀
Diego🎉😂
Is Ryan just always traveling
Here before a day 👇🏽
ı check that you take your device at night the device not at the same spot
Do the opposite
12:17 is hi piss
Omaha more like oh my god
I really hate this series where you blindly give 5 star reviews. What if someone decides to trust that review and gets r@p3d or shot because they put faith in your review? You saw the supposed bullet holes, you had dirty sheets, and you said it sounded like a battleground at night. How could you submit that 5 star review?
I wanna point out the elevator wasnt some ghost lol someone clicked that floor then left the elevator before the door shut that woman was spittin theories lol
IM 5 HOURS LATE! I'm so sorry Ryan I was sleeping
why did she speak so slow 9:12
Ryan can you tell me how Spock is doing
I live in Nebraska
Ryan, plz cover econo lodge in rapid City South Dakota or Royal crest in Medford Oregon
Bro your just flexing that you have joyride and we do not
19:52 min.:............................................THE RIPPLES ON THE SCREEN..........PARANORMAL ACTIVITEE !!
Now test 5 star hotels and see if there really 5 stars
The fact that she admitted that it was haunted was crazy😂
Loved the jammy time transition
giving your heart to Jesus is the best decision that can ever be made. i can assure and promise you that if anything 🧡
5 HOURS AGO! ITS 6AM FOR ME IM IN AUSTRALIA
Now test 5 star hotels and leave a 1 start review.
1.1mil views in 5 hours is mad
Ryan is such an introverted extrovert and I love it
15:05  didn’t know I was watching Sam and Colby today 😂
1:06
i live in abq and the fact you got thru one night at motel 6 alive is surprising 😭
Ryan we get it you can’t afford 5 star hotels smh 😩
He does lie tho???
i am diego i have worked at this hotel for about 6 months i did not realize that that this was ryan but yes this hotel has definitely seen better days i try my best to be as positive about it as possible but it is hard
Second hotel was fucking terrifying  Fnaf type shit
There is one hotel that has 30- 100 ants in a bedroom AND it sucks, the ants are fire ants and they ate my meat for the dogs and they turned it to bones, they even climbed up my leg!
12:10 that guard had enough bro 😂
28:59 panda
Hey ryan I need help trying to sell water cause I am inspired to donate but being a teenager it's pretty hard. Any advice?
RYANNNN I live the UK and i wanna be able to buy ur sweets from a local shop but nothing ever comes to the uk:( plz stock in uk more importantly scotland  also love u
Your two Albuquerque videos make Albuquerque look like every Albuquerque stereotype 😂😭. Abq is so beautiful & not all shitty Motel 6's & Blake's Lotaburgers 😭. I promise!
As I am from Omaha I do not like these reviews, we apologize for the inconvenience. nice room and great content
Buying a stud finder to find ghosts 😂
Breaking bad ass hotel
a stud finder for paranormal investigations 😭😭😭
9:56  That is terrifying wtf
Hotel number 4 IS SO PRETTY
Great video man i find some reviewers mean.
“I almost bought bitcoin in 2011”  “Spock got into trash again”  These are hilarious 💀
Do you have any sour grape strips? I’ll take 50 bags please.
I am sorry Ryan, but that is a megaBIT (Mb) not megaBYTE (MB). Byte is made out of 8 bits. In other words you said their internet was 8x better than it actually is.
I did not like my own comment
you slay
WOW hi, another vid another question, do you like reading, if so whats your favourite author
Oh I’ve been to that Omaha hotel before! Honestly it wasn’t that bad for me. And you are LUCKY. I got the small rooms.
7000 COMMENT IN 5 HOURS WOW
21:10 "I'm out of sour strips" Bro ryans business haunting him in his sleeo
Help me I’m in there right now please
you should leave the links to each place so we can see the reviews LOL. Great Job!
wtf was the deal with the ring
Bro second hotel was straight up backrooms  STRAIGHT UP
22:43 why is the review so longgggg
14:11 UPS truck!
"UPS TRUUUUUCK" actually sent me 😂😂
If I was an investor on shark tank I would invest in Joyride
Has Ryan been mewing on us🤔
Leaving a comment to show the algorithm that I am engaged and engaging.
Hi                        Read more
i love your videos please don’t die
Anybody saw the eyes at 19:58 ??
Is joy ride come to masi
15:43 I like how proud she sounds about the hotel being haunted
I want joyride
You said that you were gonna be honest with your reviews but you weren't at all
The Vending Machine is the bane of someone's life 😂 what a way to respond
UPS Truuuck!!
visit haunted hotels next please
26:15 that’s not kung fu panda it’s karate bear
Ryan, I have a 1 ⭐️ review for you, you are disrespecting Minnesota, like mall of America 😮😮or like valley fair 😮😮 😊😊😊 thank Ryan have a wonderful day and keep making videos like these, thanks
I'll tell one thing St.regis is lieka 5 star hotel in dubai and across the world It's in nakheel mall in jumeira
Please oh please start bringing a blacklight. 😂
We all need a guy like this
13:00
W Ryan
Well there are lots of 1 star reviews in the uk and one in York is kinda bad I hadA view of just a building
My favourite thing is seeing Ryan walk into the hotels, knowing he is going to have to go back and get the camera 😂
I’m sure Fran was specially chosen for being a lone female in a sketchy motel.
ok...just so you are aware. 3am is the Witching hour (spirits have more energy). If there was a spirit in that room. It probably didn't care for you. however @samandcolby should invite you out now
Not him saying it feels like a gta mission is wildddd 😭😭😭 0:36
74k likerf
I live in detroit
1-star-hotel reviews in European countries when
16:44 There’s now way he didn’t ask for room 511💀
why on earth would anyone even think to remove their socks in a hotel.  you want to go the opposite direction and cover your feet instead.
Imagine realising in your sleep you muttered “im out of sour strips” and “I almost bought bitcoin in 2011”
joyride doesn't need sharktank ngl
MY DOG CAUGHT FIRE IN A MOTEL 6 ONCE 😊😊😊😊
noice.
Bro there are a bunch of fences like that in my neighborhood along a wooded area
I’m so glad u did this again
Jammys
I LOVE VANITY
18:44  That... That is a stud finder... Every house has studs ranging from 1' apart to 18" apart. That has nothing to do with ghosts. It has to do with finding supports for your house. I have always trusted Ryan, but I can now say he is a fraud.  I repeat, That is a stud finder and every house has studs. It is a part of construction...  19:12 awe why did you ruin my fun? ugh Ryan is not a fraud
doing 2 pushups for every like (pls like i want to get jacked😊)
Im glad ERT abbreviated their name
W
Why did u change the thumb nail from 13 room is haunted to don't sleep at room 13

I SAW JOYRIDE AT TJ MAX
Greg!!
amazing video like always ❤
DUDE DID YOU SEE THE REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW?!?!?
Studs are 16 inches on center bud
11:59  Ramen  sounded yummy and it was 😂😂😂
Hey ryan for shark tank you could show them joyride. It might make walmart shelves
Ryan calling 2mbps bad while I’m using 500kb 😂
The sun isn't "a big ball of fire"... it's not on fire you silly, little goose!
@ But Jesus Ministry.We think you doing a good job informing people keep it up.
The Kansas City hotel have some strong "Continental Hotel" vibes. Well, at least you can't be killer on a neutral soil.
j
FYI, to check for bed bugs check the corners of the mattress
I think Ryan officially lost his mind at the last hotel
His version of Hotel Hell with Gordon Ramsey
Yall am i triping or wasnt the thumbnail "there is a weird guy in the hall" LIKE I SWEAR I SAW THAT
can u go to Britain for joyeride pls i have ur shirt :)
IM SO HAPPY YOU WERE IN NE

That is not a casetify case smh

How does someone have the time to say all of that in the last hotel just because it’s bad although I’ve probably been to worse
Hey ryan, just wanna say love from India. Hope I can meet you someday 🫂
I LOVE U MAN❤❤❤❤❤
Love the vid

27:34 bro I wish but I live in UK 😭
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Jesus didn’t come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 👍🏽
ALBUQUERQUE MENTIONED!!! RAHHHHH! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 WERE A STATE NOT A COUNTRY🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

🗣️
Ryan if you give me sour strip i will be your friend

The second hotel "backroom" and "liminal space"
The girl behind the desk at the haunted hotel was adorable
The fact that I’m at a hotel rn😭😭😭😭

5:15 Kung fu panda is amazing
22:43 did anyone actually read all that?
why are you wearing pijamas at night but you shirtless in the morning
W jack
oh my gosh i literally live five minutes away from the hotel in Detroit, that place looked scary, especially the elevator.
WHO names a kid after a sin?!
HOTEL 1 BREAKING BAD REFERENCE
Ryan, the next video or so NEEDS to be about "Going to haunted hotels/places" because you doing paranormal activity videos is like the best thing ever 😂
the ghost was scared of jammy time
6:10 i dont think it was the staff. (It was prob a killer)
I live In New Mexico it’s like that 😂😂
UPS TRUUUUCK🔥🔥🔥
That first motel 6 was definitely in breaking bad
Ive been to the detroit hotel and yea had practically the same reaction when i had to open that door and like its detroit i dunno what you expected. also even when i went that vending machine didnt work.
Love the vid's man. Keep up the good work.
omg “jason g” yall know what i mean
14:12 the ups truck passed my house at the same time i was so confused how you knew
App name
I love you ryan
Nice. Never watched any of the kung Fu Panda movies. But have seen "Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness" the TV series. Does that count?"
I didn’t even know we had a haunted hotel in Kansas City…
Ruh
If you came from TikTok like this

Dicks sporting goods is selling the new joyride candies
We love you ryan🎉
Bro used a stud detector🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how he reads the reviews in a brithis accent
Absolutely love your content., Thank you for your continues hard work and awesome videos.
I don't know what is the main plot of the video. 1.Going to 1 star hotels and giving it 5 stars 2.Watching Kung-Fu-panda or 3. JAMMY TIME!!! Edit: do Americans walk around in their jammy's?
Hes using a stud finder to find ghosts but he is finding pipes
Fries are Belgian, Ryan. Not French…
4:22 AM cant sleep so ill just watch this. (I really need sleep)😢
Hi Ryan!!!
陽
Whenever I see Ryan post, I click on it immediately-
DO MORE HAUNTED VIDEOS! (Like haunted public buildings, like hotels or something and try to stay in the haunted room if there is one)
The security guard was so PISSED OFF 😂😂😂😂😂
pls sell them in belguim
do one with haunted hotels
but there is the thing ryan most of the reviews were made a long  time ago so probably most ofthe things that you tried to review was taken care a long time ago
Hi
Im so glad ryan has taste and watches peak films
you just jinxed yourself to get room 511
That was Megabits Ryan, sheeesh. Great video, used to live in MO and been to that hotel many times.
1m views in 5 hours lil bro going crazy
Anyone else want Ryan to do a video with Sam and Colby
2:17
jammy time ✨✨
You should stay in three haunted hotels

Oh ? Edit : thanks for the likesss
when the ryan trahan video is 30 minutes long: 😆😆
I stayed in a hotel in Omaha once and every time I got in the elevator it took me to the sixth floor before it would take me to the floor I had selected. Up or down. It went to the sixth floor no matter what I selected. Doors opened. No one there. Doors closed. And then it took me where I asked it to like nothing happened. The people in the lobby said it had been serviced multiple times and no one could get it to stop doing that. *  The hotel was really nice and normal other than the elevator’s strange trickery. The room was beautiful. Would stay there again.
i read the whole E.R.T monologue, that was definitely something
I want joy ride🥺🙏
This boy turned around and almost got ran over by a bus
I somehow knew that he was gonna watch the kung fu panda movies the moment he said he ordered Panda Express 💀
Within 6 hours gang 👇
kung fu panda 2 is my favorite movie
I miss uuuu videos
Vanity was so nice!!! 😭<3
who else thought his food was pap...
your videos are so fun man and really not forced to do. I hope you enjoy making them as much as we love to watch them.
The last one is not hotel it's the whole house
i love watching ryan do these kinds of videos, they entertain me every video. + cant wait for joyride to come to my door (i CANT WAIT TO EAT THEM)  edit: JAMMY TIME
I’m so glad I was watching the other video within the same 10 minutes of it being released and you were doing this same thing but finding breast milk on the fridge. I’m glad to be one of the people who gets the inside joke
Mad respect for Ryan, he’s got to be the funniest guy ever
Just thinking about people believing in ghosts and stuff sounds so stupid to me: must be America.
22:43 NAHHHH BRO WROTE AN ESSAY
That is not St. Regis
Hey should try 5 Star hotels and rate them
Jammy time
w greg
vanity is the sweetest, but its a little weird she was so happy about it being haunted.
Someone outside was saying he wanted to do some b0uncy b0ncy! 1 star.😤
Hotel staff are not supposed to say your room number out loud. The fact that the first one had staff trying to break in too is  🚩 for trafficking
How i found ryan: 1. popped up in color blue on YouTube  2. I clicked on one video 3. I liked the video 4. I subscribed 5. I watch his videos now
So since you travel and do everything for work, does it mean you write everything off on your taxes? In a way you get to do this awesome stuff for free
Yo its Greg! had a great time playing shuffleboard with you!❤ (Edit: Wow thanks for all the subs guys very appreciated, just trying to grow the cannel yk❤❤)
Welcome to Kansas City. You want to try out some hotels go further east of Kansas City into Blue Springs Independence bet you can't get a five-star review out of some of those hotels. Lmao
The one that tried to get first 👇
What if you go to 5 star hotels and you have to leave a 1 star review . Rules : do not lie
I wish I wasn't had no school so I can be like this handsome man
Help
"we aren't in kansas anymore"  Mans was in Missouri.
I am going to runnow or elze i wi
7:15 amtrak arrowless arrow!
👇People who actually *did* read that essay of a review.😂 22:43
What did the guard say when you asked him or her where the vending machine is
Does anyone know what the pull up gear was Ryan used at the Motel 6? Looked pretty good

Your invitations to reach 1000 subscribers only😊😊❤❤ 3:03
It might be time to just build your own hotel.

you should get pink sunglasses or SpongeBob sunglasses
I can't believe there's someone called Vanity 😵
your new candy was already released at my Albertsons like a month ago 😭
Did anyone else actually read E.R.T’s while review? 😂
Can you make this a series
15:00 your comment on that review made me laught for like 5 mins straight (with my mouth full of cucumber).
id rather sleep in the wilderness than these hotels
Ryan should just make it a tradition to eat Panda Express the first night at any place he’s staying at.  Oh hey!! Kansas City, I live near there haha :)
Awesome
my jaw literally dropped when i saw the last hotel room
He ran out of 1-star ideas I guess.
The first thing I’ve noticed was you’re looking way more buffed must be the 100 pull ups. Btw do you answer DM‘s on insta ?😅
Support joyride
Stock more joyrides 😭 and get review more haunted hotels !
5 stars
NAHH I STAYED AT ST REGIS FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS IT WAS HORRIBLE. BUT THRY RENOVATED IT FROM THR LAST TIME I WENT
Nice
AMEN
VERY GOOD

I was literally eating Ramen while watching this, and then the Ramen part came up😂
W VIDEO!
Rko
Ryan in the first room 2+11=13 😮
PLS KEEP DOING THIS SERIES 🙏
Ako
I was expecting a roach instead of the  front desk lady
6:21 Doesn't this sound like Fears of Fathom chapter 2 ??
sheesh
I’ve actually been to the second hotel. I remember thinking it was really nice but then cops pulled up because they got a tip of drug dealing in the area. Then they searched all the rooms. Including mine😂
i just finished watching EVERY single 1 penny video, the editing has changed so much, you are my favourite youtuber and i got curls cause of you ❤
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEEEEN (I watch the penny series everyday all day and miss it ur my favorite ytber ever)
Do the world's most haunted places, end up in room 1408 at some point, leave a 5-star review
Painting in bed… oh!
Hi Ryan.😀

First part was a 5 star one
26:13 IM SO JELOUS THERE IS LITTERLY THE LIMITED VERION RARITY TOY BEHIND YOU THAT IS 3GEN
Bro why is ryan falling asleep in his jammys but wake up without a shirt?
you made me scratch my nose violently
SPOILER BLOCKER ⛔️📛
wasn't the second hotel Saint Regis  from that hotel hell with gordon ramsey in like 2013 ?
Someone in Albuquerque watches Trying Ryan and saw his name on the books. Make no mistake, these places all set you all up!
Your running out of ideas, ryan.
no one knows why Ryan replied “hi on this comment”
Among us    Get this thousands of likes for among us
the 4th kung fu panda movie was not good the other ones where thow
Welcome to Detroit my guy lmao,Detroit is getting nicer but also it’s still terrible…there working on the nice part…appreciate what you got eh?
I love how at 19:02 Ryan was using a stud finder to. Find the ghost of room 511
product placement of dyson fan past few videos is great
24:33 bro this is not a hotel room this is a whole house 😂💀
999999th view!
"As if someone literally designed wooden beams... Wait, this is a stud finder..."
1 stars are 1
Hey Ryan how ever try food Aruba I bet great idea for contact on YouTube, but you do great start reviews
I want more of ghost hunter Ryan!
Where's Rebecca
Ryan your sooooo amazing 👏 😍 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤i love ur videos😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and ur so funny 😊😊😊

Vanity is waaayyy to excited to be working in a haunted hotel...
He Was So Confident He Wouldn’t Get 511 💀 16:31
When is it gonna be in different countries
Hi❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

If you could stop plugging your candy brand 😂it’s not funny anymore
That last hotel room is crazy
I love you videos Ryan and I’m hiped everytime I see a new video from you. Your videos are funny, interesting and really good quality.
15:46 “ It sure is!! “ “ oh…! “
GO TO CECIL HOTEL
I love shark tank to 😊
i need to know what happened with/to the security guard
The art deco exterior in the 2nd hotel looks nice. Also the last hotel room you stayed when I first saw it I thought "There is no way that's a one star review"
I can't believe you didn't like kunfu panda
can u pls sell JoyRide in Belgium to?
Video 5 stars ✨ same sound effects some new ones to. Also bonus watched king fu panda one of my favorite franchises. Watched it with my girlfriend to. Not to much brand promoting.
GO TO CECIL HOTEL!!!
Btw Ryan idk if u did this but like 2 weeks ago I got ur gummy worms from Walmart
Im early?
best youtuber
“Come on man.” -Arnold 😂😂
I knew it was stud finder I was just waiting for you to say it
I can respect Jammy Time. I do it myself - with a hoodie and sweatpants. Thanks as always for the smiles and laughs, Ryan!
SO EARLY HOWDY RYAN!!
bro that's just a stud detector lol
Blue is the lie
Im glad creators like Ryan Trahan are giving under appreciated states like New Mexico more attention ❤
Ryan should really do a paranormal investigaion!!!
Stop doing yourself  dirty
The only way I could do that was if you wanted me too I could come and pick it out and then I can go to your place or whatever and you could pick me out of there or you can just go pick me out and I’ll be home by then if that’s what you’re going back home I don’t care if I can just go home or whatever I just want you know what you need and I’ll just be here and you don’t need me anymore to do that or I don’t want you anymore I don’t care anymore I’m not even trying I’m not going home I don’t care I’m not trying I’m not going anywhere I’m not trying I don’t care about that I’m just saying I just don’t care what I just don’t know how you don’t want you don’t want you don’t want me and that’s fine but 😢you don’t want you don’t know how I just don’t know how much you don’t know what you don’t know if I just don’t want you don’t know I just don’t want you don’t care I just want you don’t want you unfortunately and you just know I just want to talk about anything you don’t
I have a question, it is a bit dangerous video, but what if you go to the cecil hotel?
Bro he has NEVER had pijamas?!?!?
Wow this vid was only 4 hours ag- nvm that’s pretty late
Hi I have nothing to say so hi👋
Bro using casetify case.
No toys for Spock?
You didn't say hi to me while in KC. I love the Hotel Phillips!
You need to watch the Kung-fu Panda show too :).
Great video! Also, why is there a Digimon? 26:13
Are your candys coming to Australia
Did a ghosst wipe your butt 💀😆
I live in Michigan

wizard of oz line  24:35
Why do I Love the music when he’s going / reviewing a hotel
omg yu posted 😭😭 MY YOUTUBE KNOWS ME BRO, i didn’t even see the post it automatically played ❤
🦶👸🍖🧨💣🔪🧸👌👈
The fact that you’ve been in Omaha twice now 🤯 I’ve missed getting to meet you twice!  Come to Lake McConaughey, NE
The music when you move places sounds like an adventure
You should test 5 star hotels and rate them 1 star
Nothing just a typo at 21:53 its MBPS(Mega Bytes Per Second) not Mbps (Mega Bits Per Second) :)
Video ok
hii
Damn Ryan was in MO and didn’t come visit 😢
He should have went to the haunted hotel nba players go to in Oklahoma
15:44 she sounded so happy❤
HIT UP SAM AND COBLY AND DO PARANORMAL
I actually read E.R.T Review.
Nicccceeeeee❤❤❤❤❤
YouTube wouldn’t be the same without I watch you everyday and I love that your a Christian praise God✝️
Bro the sad part the 3rd hotel i live there....
Hi
The only thing missing in this video was Ryan saying “Good morning sleepy heads!” 5 stars.
Imagine if he would've bought bitcoin in 2011....
I think u should also do 'i tested 5 star hotels'
I SAW YOU IN KANSAS!! I was too scared to go up to you heh- but I SAW U!!!!!!!!
His videos ease my anxiety
Hi Ryan, You are probably not gonna see this comment but if you did and replied it would be a blessing, I am like one of your  biggest fans, you are the best youtuber EVER
Is thare gummy bears that you made
Again Ryan? 🫣🫣🫣🫣
Did he say the movie kunfu panda 4 was "Fire"??
yes ryan, someone was definitely painting on the bed
bro why is ryan so funnnnyyynynynynynynyy
Lol
big fan p.s right after I finished watching the video I went to see if I could buy Joyride
Bring joyride on shark Tank
❤
I kinda like this series
Listening to those reviews for the first one, I got a little frightened. Be safe Ryan!
I've been to a St. Regis hotel, it was very nice!
When can you test 1 star tinder first dates?
I accept the trade ryan
Yk is a good day when Ryan Trahan posted a video
jammy time chain 👇
My video lagged right when he said 2mb per second
ryan needs to go to circus circus in las vegas
Ryan, can you please start a new company that sells pyjamas and call it Jammy Time and as the logo have you doing your jammy dance?
If you dont believe in ghosts at all, you ll most likely be fine
Survive in finland with a penny for 1 week. Imposible🙏🙏✨️🔥
Hi Jack! Used to work with him at the Mag. Nice guy
How did you find this 🤨
Ryan i LOVE this series where you review 1 star hotels!❤ Keep up the good work 💓
It is simply "JaMmY tImE"
1 star theme parks plssss
that deep breath from the security guard was all you needed to know 💀
I think ryan is going to all those hotels to look for a breastmilk 😂
Nah my internet is kb
when u where infront of the kansas city hotel i took one look and went " thats haunted " lol
I’m out of sour strips :( -Ryan at 1:03
send some joyrides to bulgaria i am going to buy them all
Our candy is going to be near you! Me:laughs in third world country stores
I dont think you need a stud finder to find ghosts, its usually an EMF reader if you tried to get that
Bellow 4hrs👇
Under 1 day crew
bro really said he gonna play with his toy
Did the red head youtuber that lives next to the philips hotel appear in the video?
Ngl you vids are annoying asf and I barely watch them
I’m a lil late so idk
bro i love the way u change your voice just to read the comments
i love that ryan is loving omaha
Love watching you before sleep. Your voice is so soothing. Great video! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
You should check out the motel 6 in Goodland, KS.
0:47 Ryan i did that
I actually found some Joyride gummy worms at Walmart
Ryan Trahan  X Sam and Colby in room 511 when?
Vanity's so freaking sweet 😭
The security guard had me dying💀💀💀
I learned so much from Ryan Trahan videos and he helped me get over a mil views
29:32 i thought the guy next to ryan was kurtis conner for a second
for 36 dollars you will get luxurios hotel room here in czech republic.
pls pls pls bring joyride to the UAE feel free to come over here too thx and i love ur videos

I love this content bro
RYAN THATS A STUD FINDER! oh i just got to the part when u relize that.
14:12 goffy ahh cartoon character laugh
Lol i read the whole review for ohama and i havent read that much since i worked as a receptionist 3 years ago
Did yall notice the pfp in the thumbnail is sam from sam and colby
I laughed out loud when you said "I'm sorry, did the ghost wipe your butt"😂
Well as soon as I searched up ‘hotel Philips” haunted cane up to finish my sentence
The Detroit hotel accurately describes Michigan as a whole: nothing makes sense here lol
E :)
Hey Ryan, but you said you’re not gonna record any more videos
bro changes his thumbnail so much times
All 3 of them are actually a truth
Am I the only one who thinks that this photo was AI generated? 13:48
“1 star hotel”… stays at a 3.1 star hotel
These hotels remind me of the movie 1408
I live out here in Albuquerque and I’ve been to the Blake’s that you went to I’ve been to several times and I remember my family stayed at motel 6. Funny realizing how bad abq is
PANDA EXPRESS IS SO GOODDDDDDDD BROOOO
9:43  nah
What review site does Ryan use? I checked for his review on yelp and didn’t see anything..
E.R.T could really make that review a novel
Keep it up I love these 1 star videos! I feel like I’m travelling with you
"You cant judge this room on the same scale as a five star hotel" Ryan do you know the number of stars youre giving out?
That security guard made me feel guilty through the screen 😭💀
4 hours ago MATE I WAS AT MY GRANDMA'S HOUSE BAKING CAKE WITH MY SISTER
27:12 didnt you ask for medium?
Bro, staying in the worst morels in the worst towns.  I recommend some security training.
Pls sell joyride in the uk
Yeah don’t move to Omaha…. It sucks so much 😂
GhostsBuster👻👻
Bro ran out of video ideas😂
What does she mean by a haunted toilet? Is there a Skidi head that’s gonna eat my butt
v869K views 4 hours ago869K views 4 hours ago869K views 4 hours ago hi

I love 1 star test videos keep making them pleaseeeeeeeeeee
I started using yelp because of you
What is E.R.T yapping about 💀
Is this a low key set up for your future plans to be featured on shark tank?
We love diego ❤🎉
I enjoy this kind of content! 😊
What was up with that security guard wish he didn't cut it
Who read the ert review?
Bro thout u could find ghost with a stud finder
omfg, I am 99.9% positive that I stayed at that new mexico motel 6.  I was going cross country to try to get to my grandfather before he passed away, and made it this far before I just couldn't go without anymore sleep.  ...lets just say I didn't get much sleep.
jammy time 😎
why is the panda looking like that😂
I am the 6000 comment
If you read the whole review like this post
Nah what ate those reveiws
the series we never that we needed
The thing ryan was using to search the walls was a stud finder and those aren't used to find ghost.
Haunted hotel☠️👻 Haunted toilet😂🚽👻 Did a ghost wipe your butt?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jammi time
yop finnaly another ryan video
letsss goooooooooo

2:12 the way he said O.M.G
Omg you should Collab with Sam and Colby
YES I LOVE THE "testing 1 star"
Bro that panda plushie was kidnapped what happened to it
Social anxiety fears this man
You should start another penny challenge
Who loves Ryan Trahan❤
Eating joyride while I watch this😊
Could you try to stay at the world most dangerous hotels😅😮
Ryan can u make a candy flavored for me  Pretty please 🥺🥺🥺
Umm Ryan what’s moving in the background when you were at the burned desk
This was so funny to see you are watching kung fu panda. Im also watching al 3 before watching 4. Keep up the good work. Love to watch your content.
When did you go to detroittttt omggggg
W nice vid i liked and commented before watching❤❤
i just saw the kung fu panda movie! its GOOD! :) my neigbor was on the canadian shark tank, dragons den! super cool, but they lost :(. CBC news did an interview wid dem tho. love ur vids

Where is your candy most propeller name some states and stores
You should take Joyride on shark tank ❤❤
Hainaak
“This thing”
Is the next candy going to be peach ring
You should take Joyride on shark tank ❤❤
12:59 that "yeah" sounds so much like Dani
😆 Ryan terrified at the Detroit hotel... we've got some very rough places in Michigan. Don't come to Flint in certain areas. It's just too dangerous like Chicago dangerous
Your videos are amazing no cap 5 star and the fact you wanted to help that man that was coughing 😊and must loved the its jammy time and you literally got room 511 😂 and the kind woman at philps hotel she was so sweet❤ and i love the oof then the rating comes up 😂 and the last review on the last hotel was longg
I hope you didn’t actually leave an FX3 outside of your room all night lol!
These videos feel so simple (no offense) but im just so entertained watching these kind of videos
My friend had some joyride and brought it to our homeschool co-op group, and passed it around the table at lunch. Almost all of us are fans, and freaked out, lol. We basically robbed her of all her candy and devoured it, it was delicious. 5/5 stars!
You know what Ryan you should go to the 5 star rated hotels to change it up
I hate people that make don’t translate
HONEY wait I get get no girls..DAD wait he left to.. HEY NONIXISTY SHUT UP RYAN TRYHAN POSTED A NEW VIDEO.
13:42 What is that building on the right side? Air? From where is the reflection? It is all a simulation
I was in motel 6 our neighbors were screaming and trying to break down the door so we were really scared and we left
16:36 Honestly it feels like you asked for it not like “can I have 511 please?” But if you say you came all the way there for the haunted hotel they want to give you the full experience
The 3rd hotel had me shivering
Come to omaha more often!!
800,000 views in 4 hours is CRAZY
5:43 Located: jammy time
Bro is really using a stud finder!🤣🤣🤣
Ryan please don't go to the most dangerous areas for one star visits (like in Michigan my home state)...we want you to stay living. Detroit has a lot of prostitution and drug issues..could be why the one star.
How to get money in life
i drive past the Albuquerque hotel every day on my way to school and football Edit: I hope ryan replies he is my favorite youtuber also RYAN be more careful here in abq i have literally seen police raids at that hotel you went to and there are drug deals happening there all the time so uhh be more careful lol.
YOOOO NO CAP u the best youtuber ong
...IS THAT SAM FROM SAM AND COLBY SAYING NOT TO SLEEP IN ROOM 13!?
the stud finder🤣🤣
Omg ghost you need ghostbusters
HEHEHEHEHEH I MADE IT IN 4 HOURS! HEHEHHE
go on shark tank with joy ride
I was watching as the views went up it was cool
i love u ryan
When is Joyride coming to india?
Omaha is great
I know Ryan is too nice, but that security guard should be fired. If you can't handle a guest asking a simple question, how are you going to handle one that's being rowdy?
One of the reveiws “ toilets haunted “ 💀💀💀💀
Bro eating the cow off the bone
Has anyone from the reviews ever reported or Said something After you reviewing the Reviews?
Which was your favorite kung fu panda
I love when Ryan uploads it like a happiness boost
The thumbnail has already changed 5 times 😭😭
the audio recordings of ryan had me dying 😭
4h ago
A Ryan and a Airrack video on the same day!
The worst one I've been to is Dutch Motel in PA...
4 HOURS AGO !
Dude I can eat up your content all day I love your videos
Is it just me or does Ryan look related to Bonnie Tyler
2024

If my comment gets 1000 likes in one day, I will go crazy
Bro is changing thumbnail every hour
50lth!
Where do you write your reviews ryan
Don't forget, whiney baby poo poo pants 😉
Who else caught that he released a new candy in this video?
I love these video so much, could watch on repeat
Bro they saw your camera on the last one and threw you a free upgrade! I got one when I took my mom to Miami Beach. Life hack: bring a big camera and record when checking in hotels.
you should start flipping people off mid way through your video
hi im a fan like my comment plz
How many of you checked your internet speed after this?
did u get to see the solar eclipse?
This comment will be forgotten
13 is said to be a unlucky number
lol you are so funny 😂😂
Bro im a duck
the 2nd hotel was not 5 stars at all.. it deserve what it is😢
Only Ryan can like this comment
I'm dead that "no breast-milk in the fridge" 11:01 has become the standard for Ryan's hotel fridge checks😂
15:00 Unfortunately you can't call the Ghöüstbusteirs™ to help you with haunted toilets. The last time someone did that, they shoved the PKE meter up their bumhole.
Ryan is so nice. He is the epitome of what this next generation is like. Overgrown children. Haven’t fully matured physically and emotionally. Just such a difference in young men today, compared to young men 50 years ago even. Not to mention further back..
Kong fu panda 2 is my favorite one, best villian.  Also room 511, definitely not a coincidence.
Love the vids Ryan ❤❤❤😊
1:53 John Martson  (John M.)
Do you think the hotel employee gave you the most “haunted” room just cuz you mentioned you were there just for the haunted hotel??
I feel bad for all the bot comments he gets
Awesome
How does this man keep on doing this stuff, when does he go home?
The Kung Fu Panda Movie Four had great animation, but the movie was underwhelming overall.
22:43 ur welcome if you wanted to come back and read this
When was this filmed
this would've been such a cool Sam and Colby collab
His accents while reading some of the views is hilarious
Lmao the description is just “jammy time”
Another banger
JAMMY TIME!!!
Ryan go to Americas Best Value Inn Satellite Beach Melbourne it’s so bad but next to the beach
Buy some blacklight to look for blood stains on beds XD
Hi
I just want you to know I still have my Triton cup
That panda needs some help
UNDER A DAY REMOVE WISDON GUY
Mmm steak and blood soup 😅
Ryan you should go to haunted hotels
I’m glad you checked for breast milk. I was getting worried.
You're crazy for leaving your FX3 in the hallway that thing costs $5000
I love how Ryan is watching Kung Fu Panda in a Haunted Hotel 😅
1 like = 100 cookies
bro is recycling videos
0:07 toilet was haunted💀
W video
Can you go to 5-stars hotells and leave a 1-Star review
Gosh darn Spock getting in the trash even in your dreams lmao. So funny bro. Apparently i do the same thing I'm gonna have to let my phone record.
To anyone who could not figure out the lie: Ryan peed his pants.
Shower head, Cindy’s nails
I’ll give 1$ to a random person for every like this comment gets
missouri ream (im on computer so no emojis :(
And it is also very rare to think about it too (which the Motel 6 is not included in the first or previous (or should I say last) hot video Ryan Trahan made). I am too shocked so shocked I don’t know what to say anymore now.😮😮😮
w video
The security guard lol
That stud finder bit was so cheesy i love it
I was at Omaha literally last week and we went to that exact same toy store and about a block away from it is a very, very good
Hiiiii🖤
I LOVE THIS GUY
You are great at youtube and,do stuff i would never do 😂
Finally I cannot believe this is the most recent Ryan Trahan and 1 star hotel and motel. I also cannot believe I thought about Motel 6 in this video and there actually is especially in the first hotel he went (which I did not though about). This is unbelievable it is so cool.
UPS TRUCK was killing me😂😂😂😂😭
Who else thinks that it wasn't the hotel staff trying to break into her room in the middle of the night...😂
Not abq 💀💀
You should try living like an Amish for three days!😊
28:08 if i get to see you sleep its a deal.
wait the thumbnail was "room 13 is haunted" moments ago
my aunt lives at michigan idk why i said it
OMG
I like vanity shes so nice! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️-five stars
Love your videos. Wish I could try your candy, but I'm a diabetic. Oh well...YOLO.  Maybe I should try it anyway. LoL Thanks for sharing.  Bekka ThePottersWife
There IS joyride candy near me. We went to Dicks Sporting Goods to get a new bat for me since baseball season is coming up, and I saw some by the checkout isle were all the worse candy was. But joyride is superior.
if ryan has 1 subscriber i’m that subscriber
Crazy!✨ here have some cheese🧀 UPS TRUCKK
It picked up multiple statements. (I almost bought bitcoin in 2011)
W vid
I watched king fu panda 4 and it was the best movie I had ever seen this year

Hi
Bro used a stud finder on the wall.  😂
Bc you did 5 star
As someone who lives in Omaha NE, this is the very first time anyone who has the amount of following you do has ever willingly wandered to Nebraska. That I know of. Wow. I actually screamed in shock
its megabit not megabyte i need you to make an apology vid right now
I STAYED IN THE KANSAS ONE, I was the toilet haunter
How to promote hotel: Make it bad Get Ryan’s attention  Populah hotel 😮😮😮
It took me like 30 minutes to an hour to read the reveiew at 22:44 also Ryan Ive had joyride and it is my new favorite candy
If Ryan gets a flesh eating disease we know why…
Kansas city is not in Kansas? My whole life has been a lie
Team E.R.T reading review
Ryan, you should do 1 star airbnb
The last hotel was definitely 4.5 stars   Who agrees  👇🏻
Yoooo another Ryan trahan video I’ve been waiting for this one
✨JaMmY TiME✨

I needed these giggles today
Im just commenting

Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best cinematic panda action movie experience ever
can you pls do a penny serise
Please do 1 star haunted hotels
2 hotel= backrooms
hi
Is that the hotel from breaking bad where Jesse stayed 4:35
So did he accidentally show off the fourth candy? Or was he just showing ropes and rope bits as one?
I read that WHOLE yelp review 22:44
The painting has weird juice stains on it 😂
15:45 SHE'S SOUND SO SWEET
That was a lot of words
17:47 W Transition
thank you for saving my day ryan
Always a great day when Ryan posts!
i know Ryan said he doesn't like ghost hunting but if he wanted to for an idea bring two youtuber named Sam and Colby they love doing haunted stuff and maybe they should all do a collab one day and do an investigation on this hotel also Vanity at the check in table sounded so nice. I feel like people who leave this 1-star review just had a bad time with their stay.
15:01
Haha you could be a comedian I love your content. youre my favorite youtuber, keep going😂
I thought the first motel was the one from Breaking Bad
Always a good day when Ryan posts
11:51 look like the shining ball room
7:21 I actually live in Detroit Michigan and I thought those buildings were just a random ah buildings But there are a lot of hotels in Detroit
The reviews of the first place have me nervous but at least I know he survived since he posted this
22:03-22:30 damn
Good.
i saw that bachmann thomas set obove the shelf in the toy store...
Hey I have heard that you accept Jesus Christ as the lord and savior is that true
Am I going crazy or did the thumbnail say “haunted hallways” before 🤨
1 like= 1 normal hotel for Ryan
Go to Breckenridge's hotels
Ryan can you feature my comment in your next video. Also people that aren’t subscribed are missing out
Omg not the Bonus peek hole 🕳️😂😭
urdabest
I think Ryan is the only person who can sleep in excrement & cockroaches & still be happy. These rooms are hell.
Ryan please for the love of god check the mattress for bugs. You will regret not looking at some point man.
0:34 looks like the fortnite logo
7:07 better watch out , cant have shit in Detroit
POV: you read the ert review
Hey ryan, I really want your sour strips and candy but don’t live in the US or Canada instead I live in the UAE, any way you can help?
I live so close to the back rooms of Detroit 😂
About a month ago I went to a a pet friendly hotel  with my parents and my dog and the place reeked like dog pee anyways Ryan what’s the worst hotel experience you’ve had
Vanity deserves a raise.
when you went to new mexico did you happen to see some blue crystals anywhere maybe a van
I wonder if Ryan was recognised at that last hotel and given an upgrade, cos that "room" was waaaay too nice compared to what the reviews have said 🤔
The clock ticking in the background was lowkey creepy
2 megabytes (MB) per second is actually pretty fast. It's actually 2 megabits (Mb). Keep up the great videos, man!
Please ask da neterlends albert heijn to get your strips bc i want dem but i cant bc i lib in da neterlends
Hi Ryan I love your videos
Ryan rlly asked if breast milk was in the fridge 💀💀💀💀💀
man i feel bad for him watching kung fu panda 4 its the worst xD
Maybe if you didn’t come in with a camera we could have saw how they really treat their customers.
Ryan's hands are the tools through which his intentions and creativity manifest. Each crease and callus tells a story of his experiences, trials, and triumphs. They are the instruments of his labor, whether meticulously crafting a piece of art, deftly navigating a keyboard, or tenderly holding the hand of a loved one.  But Ryan's hands are more than mere appendages; they are conduits of his emotions and expressions. They gesture emphatically when he speaks, conveying passion, conviction, or vulnerability. They offer comfort with a gentle touch or express excitement with an enthusiastic clap.  Moreover, Ryan's hands are a reflection of his character. They extend in acts of generosity, whether in a handshake, a helping hand, or a gesture of goodwill. They carry the weight of responsibility, whether in the firm grip of leadership or the gentle guidance of mentorship.  In essence, Ryan's hands are an extension of his identity, embodying his passions, values, and connections with the world around him. They are the tools through which he shapes his reality and leaves an indelible mark on the lives he touches.
ryan you should of told be u were in kc my dad works at hotel phillips and i can't believe u were there when i wasn't.
Nut
Don't bring back bed bugs, they're a pain
Omg😅
I'm not sure but the first hotel might have been in breaking bad, and it was painted as a place where creackheads  go
I liked my comment
So cool
JAMMY TIME 👹

Ryan should do a video titled “I went to the most haunted hotels in america”
do a penny challenge again
this man could make a video about anything and I'll watch it
I live in the suburbs of Detroit whenever I go in to the city I go in with the mindset of don’t ask questions that you can answer yourself. Because you don’t know who you’re talking to.
blessed ❣❣
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ For ⭐milk and cookies. 🥛🍪
Yo welcome to Detroit 😅
Video idea: What if instead of doing one star reviews, you do 5 star hotels and give them 1 star reviews. An Uno Reverse, if you will  Who else wants to see it 👇
the Detroit hotel is like... 20 mins away from me. I COULD'VE MET RYAN.
Who agrees Ryan should test the best hotels  👇

Ryan if you like New Mexico you should go to Santa Fe it is wonderful . You should do a VRBO video stay at sun mountain casa in Santa Fe
I’m sorry did the host whip you’re but killed me 😂😂😂15.1
You should test 1-star airlines
Bro thinks he’s a ghost buster💀 20:20
CALL DA GHOSTBUSTERS
I live In Omaha I’m so grateful for you seeing my home!
24:34 THATS A WHOLE HOUSE HELLO
that second hotel was like  the uncanny valley
Anybody know the name of the pull up gear Ryan used?
Qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm curse alphabet 😈
Honestly just watch the avatar the last Airbender because they are in fortnite now
“Hotel dirty,dingy.Faucets green and red with algae and other particulates.Which Rebecca says is some sort of benign calcification.I was bitten,sparking a harrowing allergic reaction”  *Translation into modern language:* “It was well manky innit bruv”
That toilet has seen some things
I think i have a favoriet youtuber now you never fail to make me laugh😅 😊
If Fran’s was a girl, the room could’ve been broken in by a creep who did not have good intentions
3:45 ayo 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
You should bring Spock for emotional support
Now try to spend a week in the Queen Mary
Nobody heard the oof sound 😂
Last hotel carti refrence
Ryan is not socially awkward, hes awkwardly social
could you try airlines
"Ramen sounded yummy." "And it was." Got me laughing so hard 🤣
Bruhhh I was eating when he showed the toilet
The security guard was like bro you literally past it
breaking bad refference?
U need to do a no star review for motels, not hotels. So much worse. I recommend i5
Lol I didn't even know there was Kung Fu Panda 2 what the heck I literally live under a rock
Should’ve watched breaking bad
Not me coughing 2 seconds before Ryan said that there’s a guy coughing outside his window💀
Sue me
ryan should definitely collab with sam and colby
Do u think u can find reviews in Louisiana
My name is also diego😅😂😂
Welcome to Detroit, the people suck and leave shit reviews and make the city look worse than it is.   Detroit is so much better than most out of state people think.
We need an Asia addition of this
spirit ❣❣
1:00
Thank you, Ryan, for taking me out of the sh*t current events I've been watching (Apple River stabbing trial) and lightening my dark mood.  Your videos and cheerful optimism are a breath of fresh air.

Ryan is my favorite YouTuber like this if he is your favorite to
“I was expecting a hotel, not a house, 1 star” …like what even
Oh boy here we go
Vanity definitely gave you 511 after she heard you were there to experience the paranormal- she seems pretty awesome ❤

Ryan your the best YouTuber ever keep up the good work
Ryan went from being the person with the least amount of knowledge about kung fu panda to the most because you know his friends haven't watched those first few movies in a while.
are the joyride strips gluten free?
ryan you should go on shark tank for the sour strips
"anything  but overcooked" ........ "yeah ill take medium" brother anything besides medium rare is overcooked
I went to motel 6 and there was crochcroch (yes I know I spelled it wrong)
Omgggg please investigate beds better for bed bugs. They wouldn’t be just chilling on the bed, they would be hiding in the cracks and corners of the mattress. Trust me , you do not want your house to be bed bug hell
Your the best YouTuber🔥🔥🔥
Looks like bro went from a young kid to a mature man who mews   Like look at the jawline comparison from beginning to end
Ryan I Challenge u to do 100 pull ups at 6mil subs 🎉
That last hotel looked awesome.
You look like my friend when he's an adult
Ryan. Please restock your candy. I desperately need to try them. - THE gummy candy connoisseur
Hotel 1 satalite thing:f.its just an upside down f
PLS put Joy ride in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
You’re next video should be called “Rating 1 Star Candy Stores” and there are some pretty good candy stores in Omaha, Nebraska but I personally recommend Hollywood Candys
Ryan is the type of person that could make a vid about painting a wall and it would still be fun and entertaining
8:01 / 29:48 i am using this time stamp for myself use this is you want
RYAN WHERE ARE NEW CANDIESSSSS 😭😭😭
the kid jumping at 22:49 makes me happy
Bro the security guard was so annoyed 😂😂😂

I live in MO come to st Louis plz it fun

Let's go Kansas
I dare Ryan Trahan to go to the cresent hotel. 😅😅😅 im also subscribed and i bought joyrides's. I ate them and 10/10 it was delicious. ❤
Did he even leave a 5 star review on that one hotel 😂
I hate how he says "Joyride is coming to a store near you". Its not. Other countries exist.
ryan only secretly went on another hotel tour just so he does not get clowned on not watching kung fu panda. worth
You said my name rany
💔💔💔💔💔

Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
Ryan can you test 1 star Airbnb’s?
I love the use of the stud finder instead of the necronomiphone or what ever that’s thing they use is.
ryan you should make a vid of you stating a night in the most haunted hotels in the US
His southern accents are on point 🤠
inspired ❣❣
İ liked EVERY video of this guy NO JOKE
Ryan
WHAT DID THE SECURITY SAY RIAN ??! (Edited - I used the letter i by mistake )
I like waffles
Man those cookies in the Omaha hotel SLAP 5 stars
Bro I did the same thing I didn’t watch all kung fu panda but like the Next day middle of the night I watched all three lol  and I’m ready for the fourth it was a W movie 🍿
I love your videos especially the one-star reviews for different things but I have to be honest I also have never seen any of the Kung Fu panda's and my son wants to go and see it the new one so I guess I need to watch them too😢
Bro, your videos are so entertaining
the Stud finder got me Ryan 🤣
they definitely recognized you and gave you a really nice 'room' at the last hotel
if you can have a bad attitude for no reson you can have a good attitude for no reason ryan trayhan
we all know this video never was about the hotels it was all about the kung fu panda movies 10/10 video
Gosh ❣❣
Ryan the Arizona one I forgot what it’s called it looks good it’s so bad The sounds like it’s going to brake when you sit on it  It smells so bad There’s wires on the roof the inside area it’s so bad the pool has black dots and black stuff in there it’s supposed to be 80 degrees and it’s was so cold like 20 degrees   And the worst of all oh yeah the chair brakes to  But the worst thing of all there’s brown stuff like dirt of poop in the hot tub and the toilet 🚽 you have to flush it like 2 times instead of one time just tooo name a few
24:47 it's probably limited per user, so it will not overload
5:26 OMG I LOVE SHARK TANK!!!!
Every time you post my day gets like 20% cooler (I definitely did not steal that quote from my little pony)
they just took an apartment block and turned them into hotel rooms
“DID A Ghost wipe your but”
stud finder joke was really funny
Hoped you washed your hands after touching that toilet handle, and everything else
Sent me joyride cause it’s too expensive after all the taxes for my country :))) Wanna taste it so bad 😊
Ryan jst found out my gf did it with another man she says ''its not that big of a deal'' thinking of su!cide i dont know what it is i just can't live like this anymore you probably won't see this but if you do the reason why i'm thinking of su!cide is cuz in school i get bullied for how short i am my brothers call me an immatured brat who doesn't care anyone but him, my classmates punches me and pushes me around like im some sort of robot And now this? my gf having  s@x with another man  i just  can't do it anymore

I’m sick, and you made my day.
m
I would have definitely stolen your DSLR.
You should do hotels in Canada too 🇨🇦🍁🇨🇦
That security guard needs to be sacked honestly probably the major cause of the 1 star reviews of that place
Ryan which kung-fu panda film was your favorite
I vote Ryan should go to more haunted hotels
I know your making gummy bears….
"uuuuh Spoky, uuh haunted." 😂 I mean the elevator thing. Can t remember the minute
29:57 dang this hotel is actually good
I didnt rven realize you posted this 3 hours ago, lmao

Activision Blizzard employees be like 11:03
You are one of my favorite youtubers you are the best can I hve some joyride and I gave you those ideas

Bruh the “ghost equipment” is a stud finder 😂
Thanks for coming to Nebraska again. I hope that more YouTubers will come as well. We are so overlooked. Even though we are the heart of the United States of America.
I love your reviews.
u should try freezed dry joyride stripes
Now do a video where you stay in 5 star hotels and are only allowed to leave a 1 star review.
1:28  I’m sorry how could you read that I think I’m going blind

pov you read E.R.T's review.
Stud fonder wow so i thought xD
Bro’s pjs goted
Yes, GOD’S got your back
hi
Bro, I can't find your review or any of these reviews you showed in the video on the reviews for these places.. I wanted to see your comments myself, but none are there.
Yes there are more joyride candy drop sour strawberry rope bites
Also kids wouldn’t stop screaming never know until like four in the morning it was horrible
The fact I watched kung fu panda 4 with my friends today😂❤
"Look how much this room costs 😊" Bro was born in inflation
I was in Detroit Michigan yesterday
jammy time is the best part of this whole video.
Early
I wish I saw you in misseri you should have more subscribers than mrbeast
1:36 Is it just me, or is that review one of the episodes in the game Fears to Fathom?
as an omaha resident, i have never seen that  hotel and its bigger than my apartment
Ryan eats more than any person "i know" and dude doesnt get fat. Every video hes eating and always eats it all. Just impressive and what a lucky ass

13:53 Edgar Allen Poe ahh review
OMG ryan you visited my home town i live in kansas city MO ive never been to that hotel but i love it here in missouri
Not tryna be that guy but sometimes you do get special treatment because you're a popular influnecer, why else would you get room 2004 instead of a normal room? Unless you paid for room 2004 which i deem unlikely since you were surprised by how it looked and other stuff im too lazy to tell.
Ryan should live stream when he is doing a video
❤❤
ryan, there are 217 rooms in hotel philips. there was a 0.2% chance of you getting a haunted room. that is insanely unlucky lol
Ryan Trahan, I love your videos and I hope you can somehow give me a shout out and have a good day
Did Ryan really Change the thumbnail of this video 3 times☠️
Love you
Hey Ryan pls look at this I’ve never had you’re sweets cause I’m in England so can I get some pls
The disservice of giving those hotels a 5 star review though
i bought ur sour gummy bears and i loved it and my mom is on a diet so i gave it to her and she said she will buy so many for a snack. she loved it
I don't eat steak but that looked so scary... aren't they meant to rest the meat so the blood doesn't go everywhere?? 😨 Other than that, amazing video as always lol
Great video
20:52 i almost bought bitcoin in 2011
that last hotel room is literally nicer than my ENTIRE apartment complex as a whole wtf, it's sooooo nice and the staff being super friendly yeah whole place deserved the 5 stars without trying nicest hotel I've ever seen. I can see why the rooms are like $300/night lavish af.
how do they not even fill in the  bullet holes in the doors, fucking creepy
That steak is still mooing
19:55 is that a ghost or dust

Ryan, I have a challenge for you, go to five-star hotels and rate them 1 star (but you have to be honest) I bet you can't do it.
the jungel musik is a true 10/10
bed bugs be like 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🏀🏀🔥🔥🔥
Great video! I had fun going on yelp after and finding your reviews for each hotel!
I’ve gone to Albuquerque, New Mexico
😼👍
In your next video can u make a video with faze rug 🙏😢тнαηк уσυ
Ryan definitely got 511 because he said to the receptionist he was there because he heard it was haunted 🤣
Ryan, I have been a fan since the penny series and before I hope you see this comment ❤❤
Sigma! Sigma! Sigma? Sigma?
Spoiler alert; read E.R.T's review and thank me later     :)

RYAN!! I LOVE YOUR REVIEW VIDEOS PLEASE DO MORE!!  I HAVE A ROUTINE TO WATCH AT LEAST 2 OF YOUR REVIEW VIDEOS WITH ME MOM SHE LOVES THEM!!! I LOVE YOUR CONTENT❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me and my family love your videos Ryan.
The security guard being scouted reminds me of the people at the mall who work  in the little kiosks selling lotions and get so annoyed when people ask them where certain stores are

i’m pretty sure ryan is on some type of hotel blacklist so as soon as they see his reservation they put him in a good room
Amazing!
That security guard is fed up 😭😭😭

Ryan I tried joyride last night for the first time, I got the gummy worms, ngl seemed like there was powder over them and it didn’t taste like much, and it was super tough to chew.
No shot. I was getting milk and cookies as you said, I’m gonna get some milk and cookies
Within 3 hours club 👇
Honestly surprised about the review in Omaha NE, because usually the places aint the greatest also Downtown Omaha is probably the best place
Ryan is literally 🔥 Bye FAR My Favorite YouTuber!!!
Jack is awesome 😎🆒
Vanity was so nice 😭
cool
no way he went to my state again😭
Ryan is back at it again and I love it.
Jack is the best
AGAIN MORE MORE MORE

If you didn’t come from tik tok you’re allowed to like this comment
you should do hotel cecil
Ur reviews seem more jokey this time then all the time before  Not really liking it much all the other time u actually put ur thought about the room more maybe going back to do doing that? Xp
I think Ryan should make a video about going to 5 star hotels but he has to leave a 1 star review
Şuan
Love you Trahan!
hey start using a UV light bro
Did anyone else see the figure behind Ryan when he was talking about the EMF reader? 😮
The thumbnail changed... why would you change the most important thing in my life
I’m from Detroit and I have seen that hotel. I recommend to go to the Rena sans center hotel it is very nice there.
Hello
Omaha Nebraska has a nice icu that’s my only experience with the place but looked nice from the window 5 stars

And Ryan I’ve seen your other candys out already at a store at the mall next to my house like the little red ones and I think the watermelon ones
“The toilet is haunted” same
22:43 E.R.T 's experience was so bad, bro wrote an entire essay
I’d love to know more about these people leaving reviews lol. The hotels deff were huge upgrades from the motel 6 😂 Could you imagine if the ones reviewing the Nebraska hotel stayed at the motel 6? 😂😂
To eat milk
thats a expensive way to watch all the panda movies. BUT i dig it
the excitement i feel when i open youtube to see a new ryan video!!!
Buddy come to my room i will give u 69 stars😉
5:10  i just saw the kung fu panda 4✨
Under 5 hours gang 👇
The security guard was definitely on a power trip it seems
16:06. She sounds like the nicest person on planet earth ❤😭
I think that the static electricity is probably what makes ghosts' hair stand up all crazy like they're on a Van de Graff Generator or they've rubbed way too many ballons on their heads, if you know what I mean.
Can’t believe he came to my home town of Omaha again and I still missed it
dang ryan u havent watched the past 3 yet????? u have been missing out man...
You should totally make a videos staying the night at diffrent haunted hotels/air bnbs!
I will run 1 mile for every like this comment gets (for 1 day)

Toy Story night of terror lookin hotels
29:00 Ryan goes to sleep in ✨JAMMYS✨ 29:03 Ryan wakes up 😀TOPLESS😀  Guys I think the last 2 hotels may be really be haunted… by jammy stealing ghosts.
don't know if ryan will see this but, try 5 star hotels or one star hotels in the world
Alternate title: Ryan watching kids movies to keep the younger audience engaged.
He should take Deadpool with him for these hotels
You should visit the rarest restaurants in America, I’ll start you of with one just in case “ Horne’s VA, there is only one of these buildings in the whole world. And there are some recent 1 star reviews. 🤔👍
Correct me if I'm wrong, I remember Ryan as a fitness influencer, Youtuber, stuff and saw his abs everywhere and now I barely see pass his arms... right? I'm not tripping right? (Not complaining tho, just observation)
Hi
That Kung Fu Panda was 100% product placement
do a reverse one, go to 5 star hotels then rate them 1 stars but u also cant lie
15:38 💀
man u do traveling alot
👍
Amazing
Ryan I watch you whenever I am bored and you always entertain us with suffering so we don’t have to😭😂
wish joyride was available in the UK - 1 star (jokes)
me and you ryan love shark tank
Lollipop I predict lollipop
Watching this after my back door mysteriously
Bro you've got to check under the mattress for bed bugs, in-between the mattress and the box spring.
I have been to that motel 6 in Albuquerque years back and it is a GTA mission. There are tweakers everywhere and the fire alarms got set off twice. So the fire review is accurate. They did give me a free night to use anywhere though.
bros playing phasmophobia irl
17:49 was sooo smooth ✨
Under 1 hour gang👇
Please reply to my comment

Great video btw  And the new candy the water melon I already know will be amazing! You are definitely one of my favorite YouTubers love you Ryan!

Is joyride going to be in the uk
2h team
Ryan please don’t get hurt in this vid
It’s crazy how fast his view count rises when he uploads
I love your videos You are so funny
3 hour gang here👇
Wasn't the first one in breaking bad?
22:43 My father read the entirety of that message in front of me, my mother, and my brother. He even took a screenshot of it! The things he does can get ridiculous at moments.
What happened with the security guard🤣🤣🤣I’m still confused
There are plenty of hotels and motels in Virginia Beach that have a lot of one star reviews.
i would most likely be a bit to scared to do this............
Those aren't "megabytes" per second. Those are "megabits" per second. There are 8 bits in a byte, so to convert to megabytes per second, you divide by 8.  This is like the difference in 6 feet vs 6 inches.
Ryan goes to bed wearing Blue PJs - - wakes up naked.  HAUNTED!
Damn you were just in omaha like yesterday wish I would have known! Would have showed you around!
Probably bedbugs in my opinion
lol he dropped it literally the next hour
Ryan, I live in Canada so I can’t get any joyride :(
Love the Panda Express
Check the corners of the mattress when checking for bedbugs 😊 also pick up some bedbug spray just incase 😂
Security guard was so pissed smh
The gate at motel 6 look like the croc video that bend the bar
Go to Boyer inn West Virginia it says the hotel is 3 stars but it is worse than that
In only two hours gang
Im so happy that ryan loves omaha since im from here
Why does he do these things to himself?
you should do a video where you test haunted hotels!!

That 2nd hotel looks like it used to be very nice, the exterior is beautiful, but they butchered it's interior and its sad.

I was the one who left the haunted toilet review 😯 We met two ghosts named Mark and Reggie who was stuck to the toilet, they were pretty chill.

I am a bot :|
Please give me free candy
Why Is he becoming more handsome every video!?!
You changed the thumbnail, I KNOW IT!!!
2:08 that pigeon in the background 😂
I like how the desk lady said it was haunted but with confidence Ryan: "I heard this place is haunted." Desk Lady: "IT SURE IIIS :D."
for the second hotel it’s like when your making your house in sims and spend all your money on one room and the. the rest are just terrible and cheap
斯基比迪厕所 ?
i’m bored 😐 I’m just bored 😐 I’m bored 😐 🎉
Give me free candy
I both love your videos and simultaneously am on edge, might just be my speakers, but the bits with just music are 2 times louder. *Rating* - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Hauntings, Jammies and a Second Floor? Holy Cow!
ERT WENT CRAZY IN THAT REVEIW. Also Ryan’s new sunglasses 🔥
Go to 5 star places and leave 1 star
Uwu’

Another banger
I will do a push up for every like this comment gets
this comment section is full of bots and 5 year olds 😂
Usundt
What if you did the exact opposite you test 5 star hotels but leave a 1 star review
Great Video Ryan very funny thank  you 5 stars
Why is there always the one bot saying g “only if y didnt come from TikTok” SHUT IT UP
you shouldn't look at the reviews until after you stop because it's a sort of placebo effect with expectations. Just a thought.
Uuuuuuu
Wth is that plush
"Im gonna play with my toys now" 😭😭
Motel 6 is where you keep going wrong haha 😂
What about testing 1 star bus rides, or tourist attractions? if that’s a thing
Vanity was way to happy💀🤌🏻
Bro i coughed and then he said that theres a guy coughing outside
"the cockroaches aren't the flying kind" thats something to look forward to!

The Floridan Palace Hotel in Tampa FL is horrid
15:00 "im sorry! did the ghost wipe your butt?" Ryan what-
U should try testing 5 star hotel and leaving 1 star reviews
✨JAMMY TIME✨
How many cameras do you think he has abandoned in all of his videos?
We need more haunted hotel content Ryan 🙏
Imagine your life being flying around and testing crappy hotels

They definitely gave you 511 because you said you flew over just for the “haunted hotel”
First

3:11 that is a wood core, not fire damage.

Let’s beat mrbeasts comment
No one will like this comment 😢
𝕀 𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕥𝕖𝕕 𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕕𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕚𝕥
Ryan you need to show you candys on shark tank
For the second hotel you didn’t say anything about the reviews that you went to test so does that mean you actually thought it was bad and just didn’t wanna say it?? Especially the security guard you definitely didn’t speak on that😂😂😂
They weren’t 1 star hotels ? It was the reviews
15:00 had me rolling on the floor
Early
2 hours ago!!
ok.
did you need to change your underwear 😭💀
You need to give some some respect for Ryan goin* to hotel 1 and 3   👇If you agree
WEEEEEEEE!😂😂😂😂
Bro
Motel’s are my worst nightmare.. I stayed at a motel with my family and the first room they gave us was infested with flies 😀 (we got a different room after) just don’t stay at motels

American ppl want mansion in 10 dollars
i love your hair when you wake up
What music does he use for the review writing portions? Like at 6:59
I think the last hotel knew who you were.
😂😂
That one hotel that was haunted (511)   They have some active ghosts probably deaths near that area looking for revenge and the people or person who killed them was probably in those 4 rooms, also ghosts carry energy, lots and lots of it.
I never clicked so fast in my life
Bro , fuck you           Why do you make so much great content😅😅
btw thats not 2 mega bytes its 2 mega bits which is even wrose.

comment
Vanity? As in a bathroom vanity or she’s vane? Why do mothers curse their children like that? I don’t understand. But I LOVE these videos!!! 😂❤
OMG   PLS RESPOND TO THIS COMENT(ALSO I LOVE YOUR candy )
how did bro go to mexico without the cartel pulling up
You should go to 5 star hotels and try to leave a 1 star review. Kinda like the opposite of this video.
And with the glasses Ryan takes his final form as Casey Neistat .lol great video Ryan.
I have a bird in my house because my cat got him and he is a kid😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You should definitely do more of these videos. Absolutely love them bro
Glad you caught up on Kung Fu Panda, I only saw the first one
Bro I love your vids awesome work
Ryan literally said he was shielded by God. Well done, trahan.
Under 1day team  👇
@ryan as someone who has worked in Customer Service for about 5 years, worked in Public Safety for 5 years and worked as a Subscriber to Ryan Trahan for 3 years and can easily tell you that if you can't answer the question "do you know where the vending machines are?" Then you don't belong in ANY of those industries, especially the Ryan Trahan Subscriber, only First Class people allowed here!
2:15 got me laughing so hard bc of the way he said it😂
The last one joy ride is peach rings
St Regis????? ISNT THAT HIGH CLASS
Opponents gum dem style 🕺
why is the comment "The toilet was haunted" 5 staars. WTF!💀
Who saw it was shared bathroom first😂😂😂 👇
21:04 “ that’s awesome “
You should do 5 star rated hotels in the same locations. So we can compare what people deemed a 5 star vs 1 star.
spoiler alert!: the secret retailer is target!
Hey Ryan if I have a video idea, the idea is go to five star hotels and rate them one star!
Luv these type of vids
anyone got a TLDR for ERT review?????😅
We need you to do more of these videos!
im telling you hes gonna be on shark tank soon this was a promotion/teaser @ryantrahan i am watching you
Bro, go to hotels I’m Mauritius, they’re the best, and also, why did you make the red hat logo yellow and put it at the bottom right of the video?
man u really shouldve bought bitcoin in 2011
That review from E.R.T 😂😂. Bro wrote a whole essay.
Probably people just leave 1-star reviews to get Ryans attention.
Doing 1 push up for every like this comment gets
So there is more then one KunFuPanda.  👁️👄👁️
The retailer is Walmart i saw them at my local Walmart
How do you think about that
w
My blud. The second hotel u went to was the frickin backrooms...
Me when I found out he went to Detroit: This is prob gonna be his last vid
is that an ace hat?
Sending a picture of your own poo for a review is wild
How brave  of you to go through this tragedy hope you dont get nightmares of it. Have a good day😀
I read E.R.T's review it was just about them getting overcharged on their card and how careless the employees were
Nah you HAVE to stay at haunted hotels now!
The lady who brought the steak seemed sooo nice
👇If You Like 'Jammy Time!' ✨
I think something’s wrong with that panda plushy…
New video!
Time to eat already?
comment
you need to come to Edmonton, Alberta. Like, there's this one-star hotel that somebody's literally gotten murdered in and their body is just...still in the foundation... like its not sketchy anymore but its really, really odd...
The way he said “Oh it’s a stud finder” 😂
You should bring a black light
The fact that the last hotel he goes to somebody has to write a whole 1000 word essay😅
My sister watches you and now I watch you  I subscribed already 😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Ryan -- You are required to place the stud finder on yourself to confirm that it's working correctly.
🛸
Why do you lie in the title?  3.1 is not 1 star, this is the first time I;m voting your video down :(
19:07 “OH THIS IS A STUD FINDER!” HAD ME CACKLE OMG🤣😂
Vanity was so awesome
HERE BEFORE 1 DAY
SKIBIDI VID RYAN YOU DROPPED A SKIBIDI DOP DOP PIN CAN I HAVE IT 😂🎉
ryan has def been mewing
he is obsessed with hotels
2 one looks a lot like the one in The Shining XDDDDD, uncanny
Ryan you should go to The Clown Motel.
he is nice
Ryan is starting to look like Hayley 😅
bro has my phone case how
Like this comment if you think Ryan should make a video going to the most haunted hotels
Me
Did anyone else see he changed the video cover? Or is it just me cause I swear before i clicked on the video it said "don't sleep in room 13" now it's "weird guy in the hallway"😭
This is all blud does but ther great videos😂
The bots won’t be cured, you just have to not like their comment
make lemonade bursts ( gushers but lemonade flavor )
Me: Nah room 511 just has issues. It needs repairs.
commenting under every video until ryan comments howdy under my video 11
These videos are amazing fr
I smell fresh comments
22:53 that kid jumping in the background is the cutest thing I saw today 🥹
"I'm Out Of Sour Strips" Funniest Part 😂
Bro for some reason the accents that he does for the reviews are so funny😭
ryan there is a youtuber named orkun isitmak he copys you
Ryan you inspire me so much
imagin teaming up with sour patch to get the ult joypatch
Ryan I think a big reason why your candy sells is, its healthy, just a really solid candy, and your authentic joy that you sold out the first night!, support ya
Cool video again 😂
4:12 This man is a stoner's worse nightmare bro. 😂😂😂
uhmmmm isnt 513 the one thats haunted????
Exactly 100th comment.
Think it’s time to stay at 5⭐️ hotels and leave a 1⭐️ review
I am going to play with my toys now 😂😂😂
Ryan how did you not die to dread you waited more then a hour in room 13
very on brand for ABQ 😂
jammy time
I live in K.C.😂😂
Y'all these vids are THE best 👍💯
ryan, you might have to make a liminal space vid since were in detroit michigan
i was in kansas city for 2 weeks i just arrived back yesterday
watching ryan use a stud finder to try and find ghosts might've just been one of the most hilarious things i've ever seen.
my moms name is Ryan lol ur my fav tuber Ryan and mr.east btw I got Shrek crocs hahahzhahahhahah tw love ur vids
A 4 STAR HOTEL DOESNT COUNT AS A 1 STAR HOTEL
i love this guy
I live next to Omaha like to see Omahain your videos
VIDEO IDEA FOR RYAN! Go to every state and go to the worst rated place in the largest populated city (in that state)
No way bro put his camera outside his room
You should review the rooms first then see the others reviews because when you see a review it has an impact on the way you look at the room so try review first then compare the reviews
I’ve seen your candy at Marshalls
hello 😇😄
Vanity is great 🤩
2:19 you sure  Found parts to a body udder the sofa  Got robbed and kidnapped  My dog got eaten  I got frost bite and lost my fingers and toes And at the end my room was on fire   Over all 4.5 stars
Ryan, a cool video idea might be you testing 5-star hotels, but you have to rate them 1-star. AND YOU CAN'T LIE.
"that was weird" literally just standing in a elevator wit another guy
I’m am him
Tray gang 😂❤
Is it just me or am I quite nervous to see Ryan’s bank statements
I bet you wont answer to this comment.
The security guard definitely rigged the vending machine to take Ryan's money 💀
Dude I was in that exact same store in Omaha yesterday! Omaha is so cool
14:10
Bro wrote a whole wikipedia page 22:44

Ryan: “I heard this place was haunted!😥😨😰👻” Employee:”iT SUrE Is😜😝✨✨💅💅💅”      Edit: 15:45
So I looked it up and room 511 and 411 are rye most haunted rooms in that hotel so be safe! Here is what it said on google!         The Casa Monica Hotel has a reputation as the most haunted place in St. Augustine and is often called the most haunted hotel in Florida. Two of the most haunted rooms in the hotel are room 411 and room 511, which is directly above the former room
Take me Ryan please I need to get outa the house
The amount of times he said no ants at hotel number 2
Nah bro the stud finder took me tf out 😭
Welcone to another episode of Ryan tries to get shot!!!!
Bro I'm in a hotel and I'm literally on romm 211
Ryan seems like someone who'd be awesome to travel with xD😂
2 Hours late😢
these videos are supriceingly very entertaining i think its bc uf ryans experience and personality
you should bring an ultraviolet light to check if you ACTUALLY WANT TO SLEEP THERE XD
The fact that he did all of this to just watch kung fu panda is crazy
0:51 Jason G. huh? Does his last name happen to be Grace??
JAMMIE TIME🥳🥳🥳

If you came from tiktok than.. GET THE HELL OUT AH HERE

This gives me Queen Mary vibes in Long Beach, California
Imagine how the ghost feels about this, you are just hanging out in your room and then a goober comes in and blinds himself with a flashlight.
Has a stud finder, doesn't make a stud joke  1/5 star reviews
which was your favorite kung fu panda movie?
That’s not Po who’s that 💀
I ❤ your videos and I am a big fan
FYI motel 6 is a motel hotel rooms don’t open to the street 😂😂
Ryan is that guy that will find something positive in anything

U are so brave Ryan❤
Literally I had a dream last night about meeting you
I have never seen Joyride in any of my local stores before until you started talking about it and yesterday while looking for Mr. Beasts bars at Walmart I spotted them right next to his chocolate! They were Joyride sour gummy worms I bought a bag and they were really good! Hoping to see other Joyride candy show up there soon!! :D
Hi I am you
“I’am out of sour strips”
Yippe
Ryan using a stud locater as a device for haunted investigations is actually hilarious 😂
That's where coryxkenshin lives 7:08
Why was security guard annoyed is he lazy or is he tired
bro at 15:45 it started glitching
Ryan is back in Omaha my home town I live in Omaha and its cool knowing that one of !y favorite youthbers are in Omaha
Ryan definitely coming from two friends who live in abq yes motel 6 Uber serious dangerous my friend got killed in the parking lot and haunts motel 6. 😂😢
ryan i will let u know that french fries are not really french ( sorry if im being a nerd and u dont like that)
*Ryan, forget your 1 star hotels... YOU NEED MORE HAUNTED HOTELS!*
Bullet Tank
I don’t think ERT likes it 22:44
IM GETTING A KICK OUT OF YOU VISITING MY HOME CITY ALBUQUERQUE LATELY <3 YES LOCK UR CAR RYAN LMFAO
The security guard was pissed
As a former Omaha,NE native, DO NOT move there!!! Also, the emporium is haunted.
If you didn't come from Tik Tok, then you're not gay.
Love the buffering on laptop 😂 the little things
That's probably the motel in breaking bad series lol

Love your videos so much
How are none of these 1 star hotels in Florida?? There has to be some awful 1 star hotels in Orlando. I’ve been to one or two of them. Come risk your life in Florida next time. Haha.
To Ryan.  My dad is very anti youtuber and he is always complaining about the new generation. I showed you to him and now every time you post he sits down with me and watches it with a smile. He is always so busy and I almost never see him. When you post he makes time to watch and I want to say thanks for videos! We love them  and I love watching them with my dad. It makes my day! Thanks ❤😊
Jack is the best 😄
Hello
The worst motel 6 in florida would be the marianna motel 6

You have definitely won me over with your charm and charisma... such a genuine guy you give me hope for our next generation, cheers to your next video!
Can’t find his review in that motel 6. Are his videos legit ?
Also I live michigan

Ryan is really fun to watch. Also he makes me laugh like no other creator.
HELLO

Like this if you want Ryan to do “I Tested Haunted 1 Star Hotels” where he only visits hotels with some kind of ghost claims in the review 👻 i wanna see a whole spooky episode

ryan spends so much time traveling to hotels he could live in them
Extremely dangerous considering that a lot of cheap motels are used for drug dealing and prostitution.  Hopefully you BURNED all of your clothes and luggage because guaranteed BED BUGS tagged along.
yes an ryan trahan video lets gooooooooooooooooooooooo
heller
24:35 ryan please stop jump scaring us lol
1 hour 33K like 👍
His videos are immaculate Af 😂
Ryan I don't understand that you are saying you are christian but entertain/are looking for demons GOD is stronger and if there is a demon you could plead the blood of Jesus and/or say the name of Jesus and they will flee. If you are looking for demons that is giving them rights to come, sin can also give them legal rights. There is nothing to be afraid about IF you're on the winning side with GOD GOD is our protector, but if you willingly walk away from His protection, that's on you  I hope someone will be helped by this <3 GOD bless
Motel 6 room is 211, that’s my special number, because of my feb 11 birthday. 😅
14:59 " i'm sorry did the ghost wipe ur butt? ,,
Ryan even dreaming about his sour strips
9:43 ok then be prepared to see Connor 💀💀 (from DBH)

@ryan hi your better than any other YouTuber on the 🌎
Finally a new Video ❤
good vids 5stars
The video was going good until you said the movie was fire
I hour gang 👇
At 12:00 did you have to run back those last 9 seconds to get your camera and then wait another few minutes to use the cross walk again? 🤭
Tell my why Ryan is the best person to watch while eating 😂
borgor
LOL RYAN
Moreee of these videos please
i cant wait for joyride to come to a store nearby so i can try them
bruh
In hotel 3 i believe (I forgot) the motion sensor if going of multiple times means the ghost was looking for something important to them
Everyone that love Ryan 👇🏼
Ryan, you should visit Postojna jama in Slovenia.
why is all he does now 1 star thing
You actually asked for medium, not medium rare :D
You should go to the Cecil hotel
1:30 that door most definitely  has a deadbolt.
Ryan, care for yourself. I want another videos :D god w you
I live in Missouri
I can’t wait for the watermelon wedges
Ryan, that's not a big ball of fire, that's Sephiroth casting Meteor, you can't run
Ryan be teaching us to look on the bright side 👌👌👌
Ryan: Jammy time Also Ryan : wakes up shirtless
This is the first comment 😅
Petition to make Ryan go to 5 star hotels but he must leave a 1 star review 👇
Ryan my eyes please don't shoot a flashlight in front of the camera :( it hurt
wow
steak
One of my favorite things of these videos of his is that "ufff" with the stars the place got 😂😂😂😂
E.R.T was really mad wow-
Top comment plz❤
0:15 we need a ryan and kris collab!!!
OMAHA MENTIONED!!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
The st. Regis was once a to tier hotel.. it has gone down hill over time. But the architecture is beautiful and the bones are good.
if ryan only has sour strips out now why was i able to buy joyride peach rings at my local grocery store?
ALBEQUEREQUE IS ALSO HOME TO BLAKES!! 😱 OH NAH HES DEAD
Hotels are a hot spot of human trafficking. If you are a woman, and you are traveling alone, there is a chance that someone will try to break in
Why don’t you try going to 5 star hotels and you have to rate 1 star being honest
Ryan I don’t think hearing a scream and then sirens is a very good sign
Wait is the first one is the one that the game fears to phathom[i think i misspelt it] picked ?!😟(i recommend watching/play the game)
Under one century gang  👇

Bro I’m in abq right now and my parents are saying that we are gonna stay at a motel 6 so now I’m scared. 😅😅
Where do these YouTubers that have millions of subscribers, getting hundreds of thousands of views in an hour, posting the same content as all the others (which is somewhat entertaining but nothing special) and all of them suddenly sell “sour candy”…are they plants or what? Not hating, just legit curiosity
Only People Who Saw this Comment at 1pm Can Like it.
This is the pontins of America
The first one he went to was the motel from breaking bad 😭
I was so surprised when he said he was going to Detroit, I love Detroit I also love your videos, which is why everybody should subscribe👍🏼
SHIP JOYRIDE WORLDWIDE PLEASE
I read his review thoroughly my lord
be careful ryan your candy looks like edibles

You could say this video was a joyride, you get it because Ryan and the candy, never mind
DO  HAUNTED SERIES 😫🙏
Your candy tastes great!
what is your favorite kung fu panda movie
Oh I witnessed the thumbnail change nice
E.R.T just fulfilled my reading requirements from every year of elementary school that I skimmed. Also, I would like clarity if exiting the elevator ensures that I see a young Jack Nicholson (honestly it could’ve been Jack at the front desk 😶😳 and would’ve made perfect “Shining” sense). Good Trahan day with not only 1-star reviews but also haunted rooms, unhinged characters, and myth busting!
You gotta make a pineapple joyride flavor
The goat of YouTube posted again
Howdy.

if you causee the chernobyl incident like this comment
Live laugh love Nebraska ❤
love ur  work matte !!
Problem with 1 star reviews is they often got unlucky which makes them put a 1 star review when the usually experience is 4-5 stars
Hey Ryan, are you passing oompaville in sales? I hope so, what a terrible candy they have. 🤢🤮
But on a serious note you should check out this motel i stayed in called the midland railroad hotel in wilson kansas that was the most creepy place i ever stayed in my life you should go man!!!!!
i dare you to stay at the cecil hotel..
17:49 - Ryans edits just keep getting better

You spelled Albuquerque wrong
LETS GO!!!!! I have been waiting for another video i love your videos
Under one hour gang  👇 (First time doing this)
Jack is the best.

Man I missed you for the second time in Kansas City, and you were right down the street from my apartment. I’m going to catch you out one of these times Ryan!
Let’s all agree Ryan does that craziest stuff😂 he deserves all this
I’m joyride
This a spooky video
hey, any updates about joyride in target and how much will it be for one pack?
If you didn’t come from TikTok like
the fact that i’m living out of these rn lol
It's not imposter syndrome if you're actually an imposter
You spelt Albuquerque wrong
I love how Ryan always sees the positive side in things. Like, the bullet hole doubling as a peep hole?? 😂 I think we can all learn from that
4:15 is he dying?
3.6k comments is crazy for a vedio a hour ago
When he left his camera outside of the door out loud I said, "WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT"
I loved the pissed security guard 😂
"I almost bought bitcoin in 2011" DUDE OMG LMAOOOOOOOOOO

Hey hey I can definitely say that this video is going to be the banger before seeing it because I am aware of the world class content Ryan sir provides us  You are my favourite one ❤
People who tried to read the whole    Review but got bored  👇👇
no fucking way. someone from the tophiachu fandom please confirm if this is infact THE motel 6 she got kicked from 1:10
you should collab with Pete Montzingo and visit the Cecil :)
Econo lodge and suites outside Fort benning Georgia is absolutely gross. Hookers openly use it all nite.
Great respect to Diego and Jack.
16:37 what is that in the background on the left
why was Vanity HAPPILY saying the hotel is haunted?? Lmao
As a parent I would be concerned a group of adults came in their jammies to a childrens movie!
9:53 DID JUST RYAN ENTERED THE BACKROOMS???
17:04  pls replace that "Stud Finder" with a "K2 EMF Detector".
Good job bro vid is so good
Motel 6 is very dangerous😅
Bro typed eat milk 🤣🤣 28:06
*The security guard was so annoyed* 😂 By the way, I'm the worst fitness influencer in the world(true), you should try my workout

Hey Ryan can you go to PR aka Puerto Rico because the hotels are very good and Puerto Rico has good food very tasty  and there is a place called rincón and it’s very beautiful and a place named dorado it means golden it’s a beautiful place and can you put joyride on Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 and there is a lot of shooting but it is like chill in Puerto Rico cidra and I’m saying this because I’m Puerto Rican
Noe you should test five star hotell but you need to leave a 1 star rweiew withot lying
thare are so much commits in 1 hower lol              .          .          .         .         .

For some reason then Ryan said “time to bust the ghost of room 511” for some reason I thought he gonna say “time to bust the ghost of 9/11
Haha even your subconscious is bummed you didn’t buy more Bitcoin back in the day.  I feel the same way buddy, I feel the same way. 😂
Why every time Ryan goes to a hotel he looks for breast milk in the fridge💀
As someone who lives near Albuquerque you just learn to block out the siren sound because you hear them so much. I personally would be scared to just be standing in the parking lot of that let alone stay the night. And of course you picked the most sketchy one too 😭
Hol up this was 1 hour ago?
I can’t believe you went to Nebraska I’m sad I didn’t get to see you
I also didn't watch all the kung fu pandas 😂 I just watched the 4th
Can you 5 star hotels 🤔
This comment ? Is special .
That one unemployed friend on a Thursday:
That security guard was gonna give you a knuckle sandwich
So... they aren't 1 star hotels??
Ryan pls respond
I just watched the original vid   This couldn’t have came out at a better time lol
YAY YOU WENT TO KANSAS. I should’ve met you 😤

I like that you're trying out the hotels it's a cool idea, but the "Honest 5*" dont make sense.. It's not honest if it's always the best.. That's what reviews are for.
“Medium sounds good” a little later “I ordered er medium rare” I sense a discrepancy. Lol jk love ya Ryan, ur smile and personality makes me happy
Ha more like uBS TRUCK eh eh ha

Dude invented a hack to travel, make a video that pays for all travel and repeat. Genius
Do the opposite and go to 5 star places and leave a 1 star review but you cant lie (Im so evil)
3 star hotels are far from 1 star 🙃
BED BUGGSS!!!
Ryan next up do 1-star shark cage diving. I believe that such video will suceed.
come back to the O soon ryan, we love the fact that you’ve came back and supported Nebraska (i always found this state boring but im glad someone else who isn’t from here thinks that nebraska’s cool) come to taqueria tijuana in 402 street, i used to always eat there with my parents when i was still in elementary. 🙏🏽
you should try visiting a 1 star review hotel in INDIA, that's the true nightmare
It’s form my home town
I liked this video without 10 seconds. Love this series.

This video is Ryan's version of Kungfu Panda in every way: I laughed way more than i used to in any of your videos while still learning a ton of things (pun intended)
I really enjoy your videos and The Ku Fu Panda movies are amazing😊 The first hotel look good 👍🏼

Try the topaz hotel in Daytona there was bullet holes bed bugs roaches and mean staff also people ran a van into our room
Ryan had the best content
Bro entered the back rooms on the second hotel

Bros content always entertains, like if you agree
You should make 1 rated airlines in America
Huh

Ryan Trahan lives the best type of life there is.
The hotel elevator door is concerning and the noises-
Time to get my dopamine popping again. These vidoes are just so good ❤.

You should go to 5 star hotels and leave a 1 star next!
I think jammy time should be normalised, instead of getting weird looks out in public
Hotels will find him
Keep up the great work Ryan!
Hotel yorba in Detroit is where it's at
Every time Ryan posts, it’s like a birthday gift 🎁 ❤
yours the best
Man this video is great! You should try 1 star food reviews across the world WITH low star airports (if ur risky). And you should do it with airrack
For every like I get, I will do one pullup with Ryan!🎉😅
Hi

Remember people, always check the hotel fridge for breast milk

Hi
I love your videos!  Could I request maybe not putting gross photos on them, though... that clogged toilet thing, like there wasn't really a need to put that on the screen.  You didn't even need to use that review if you didn't need to.  Blurring it out doesn't really make it much better.  And there was another video recently where I think you showed a guy who was having a bloody nose or something?    It just seems like a really weird thing to have in your videos which are usually super clean and safe to watch with breakfast and with everyone present.  Just a friendly request!
Every Ryan trahan is the same these days (no hate)0

Im traveling alone for work and I deliberately got on YouTube to watch Ryan's videos to psych myself up to go out on my own. Perfectly timed video
ert is a mr typeo

I wonder how long he was sitting on that stud finder joke haha
What are the chances of getting room 511 out of all of them
Love this vid❤😊😂
Bro posted on my birthday🎉
What’s the song from 5:34 to 5:40 called?
As someone who worked at a decent hotel (nothing super fancy but it was definitely the best one in the town with only one other being a close second); We have gotten reviews so freaking crazy and it usually stems from someone not getting something we don’t have and then just completely blowing up on yelp over things they never brought up to us. One women left left a review saying she was being judged for having tattoos by me… I am covered in tattoos, I was just wearing a sweater. She also got upset because we were sold out of the room type she wanted since she was a walk-in. Wonder what she was really upset about 🤔
Nice pj
doors reference? (dread at door 13)
Whens joyride coming to the uk, I'm wanna try them soooo bad
your really my fav youtuber<3
I was laughing at Ryan using the stud finder, I paused the video from laughter and RIGHT as I paused it my mom called called my phone which jumpscared me
Hi Ryan

I SHOULD’VE WOKEN UP EARLIER FOR THIS:(
You should go to hotel Coronado and stay in the haunted room
Im kinda surprised that Ryan didnt single out 1 person that he absolutely loved, but it seemed like most of the hotel staff/reception staff seemed over all very friendly and helpful.
Ryan
Spread word about stop commenting this emjoii👇
That night transition tho
Why didn't you just set the alarm clock in the Detroit Regis hotel? That was giving me anxiety. Lol 🤣

video idea: testing 5 start hotels but i haft to leave a honest 1 start review (i will sue i you dont give me credit)
I don't think E.R.T likes the Magnolia hotel (my opinion)
Who else read the long review following with your eyes hurting
Bro you see the sign behind you that says magnolia it's a song by playboy carti magnolia at 22:00
Best YouTuber ever. Thanks for the funny and crazy videos Ryan
hi
the last hotel is fire!!!!!!
I’m here!
No joke I felt sick before watching this bro has cured me
When Ryan was in the hotel and he was using a stud finder I was like wait ain’t that a stud finder
I think the burn holes are from crackheads smoking
As someone who grew up in the metro-Detroit area that hotel is one of the worst I’ve ever been to. Staff was horribly rude hotel room was unfinished (like yours) and Uber wouldn’t even come to the hotel :(
4:32 GYATT
Waaait hold it right there, you didnt even include the security guard's reaction in the video :/ C'mon Ryan???
If there is ever a YouTube hall of fame, Ryan should be the first class.

More testing 1 star places!! Restaurants next ?. Plss
My review about Ryan Trahans videos which i have to live a 5-star on point review for, despite whatever the other reviews says about his videos. 🥶🥶😪
Hey Ryan, if and when you get Joyride into shops/stores, will you be putting them in other countries shops? Ex for Britain: Tesco, Asda, Lidl etc etc.
The music when introducing a new place is low key fire
Ryan Trajan buts so much effort for us viewers, he deserves more subs
Yesss Ryan the king of testing 1 star hotels 😂👏🏼👏🏼🎉👑
Every like this gets = 1 pushup

As someone who lives in omaha, i agree with ryan
YEEEE
So.. Ryan. I saw some joyride gummy bears. Like a month or so ago in a store.. I don’t think that they were supposed to be there.. they were your logo but I could not find them online. Also could not find the sour strips.. very confused.
Video idea recommended: I tested Haunted hotels reviews in San Antonio! (Btw I’m Railfannerj
Please Ryan can u pin me it will make my day
Remember the review “A killer standing at my door”
honestly the second hotel was the worst hotel ryan has ever reviewed from what i could see it’s horrible  the staff, who sounded very annoyed to be there, and it looked like ryan was going through a massive maze to get to his hotel room it would be more common for people to get lost then to find there room. also the pictures on there website looks like a very obvious scam. i can’t even describe my level of sadness/anger when the security guard basically just got super angry at ryan for simply asking a question? giving 5 stars to that place is not deserved at all.
Do a video in Mexico Cancun I’m here for holiday
You should try 1 star transportation
12:13 he didn’t want answer that question
hi
next time you do this BRING A BLACK LIGHT
ASSEMBLE... he has posted..
17:56 Why did I squint? WHY DID I SQUINT??!!

NO ANTS- BS!!😂  I am a former housekeeper, and yes, I have left items in the fridge. LOL sometimes just didn't think about it. Sometimes too H!gh to lol. BUT... for the next 1-star videos when you check for ants, you need to leave food on the counter for an hour or two while you go out and do something.  --ants only appear where food is.the closed bags of food from vending machines are so sealed that ants won't be there (if the machine is clean).   And your bed bug check was pitiful. You definitely picked some bugs up to take back to Hailey..  ooo, souvenirs lol  You gotta lift the sheets and check the flappy rim of the bed and look for black spots (poop) and carcasses.   So yeah, change up your checks next time lol I dont approve 😂😅😂😂

There is a haunted hotel in Charleston South Carolina I forgot what the name of it is but it is pink and a lot of soldiers d!ed in it and other events so that’s why it’s so scary i actually don’t know if it is still a hotel 😅 but there is a restaurant that’s attached to it and that’s open 😊 I also haven’t looked at the reviews so I’m not sure if it gets low ratings I think it’s just haunted.
Another video where this guy came to where I live which was Albuquerque. Welcome back, my guy! 😃
