He deserved to be banned
The realization of who always gets a sniper scope on everything😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How has it taken me so long to notice that Dimucc is green screened into Greg's apartment.

Guys they are using something called knex to build those guns and i even have knex but i have no skill to build a gun
Greg when he eats a chicken leg:   Greg: i need to add a sniper scope
Im trying this loadout lol
Imagine he wants to use his fist He says:can you put an sniper scope on it?
How you make it
I was about to say. I was missing the sniper scope
"michal: ... and a sniper scope... Loadout maker: who sent you Michal: oh uh nobody.. Loadout maker: dont make me ban you as well Michal: it was greg Loadout maker: thats it, its about time i deal with him!" Got me laughing
What's going to happen next

I love how the gunsmith threatened him with the horrible gun 😂😂😂
Just realized he has a Maryland flag in the background. I also live in Marylnd

Facts
@Ryth

What does he use to make the guns
Which cod is this
danm...
F****K
😂😂😂😂lol
Wy did you tell him    fuck you🤬😡😤😠👿
i didn’t notice until i watched the third thime that @Dimucc was greenscreened
So you live in Maryland
Imagine being banned just for customizing a crazy loadout

Bro Dimucc was green screened in if you look carefully you can see it around his arms and hair guess he did not have time to go to his home
Customization guy: What do you want this time? Player: Can you put a sniper scope, under barrel shotgun, under barrel grenade luancher, and a knife thrower all on my fists?  Customization guy: What!? No that's not even possible! Just stop! Stop being a moron. Good god! Wait, are you friends with Greg?  Player: Yeah, how'd you know?  Customization guy: Well that explains a lot...  Player: So...? Can I get those attachments?  Customization guy: How many times do I have to say, you can't get all those attachments on your fists. God... You really are moron.  Player: Aw c'mon can't you just get your hacker friend to do it for me? Customization guy: No.  Player: What? Why not?  Customization guy: This episode has dragged on for too long
What going on
And This is where it all Started....
The fact that cod even lets you put sniper like scopes on Auto fire weapons.
gai
extended barrel with a stock an bipod if you can with more powerful ammo and then sniper scope could work
HI
I use this in cod
@ryth
What an m4 supposed to be a long-range weapon so it actually makes sense to put a sniper scope on-
Greg dont hang out with Lozers they are all cringe unlike you, join the Ryth army!
I love videos that a lot of my favourite YouTubers are together !but where does he buy the stuff to make the gun its soo cool
Boo ban himself
yawaka
The perfect loop doesn’t exi-
You look similar 🤯
Hello
Stop with the sniper scope pls
Greg will be ok he’s using Greg’s load out sooo yea you know what will happen
What do you use to make your guns?? Tutorial???!!!
Oh this guy would hate me with my dumbshit weapons
Bro literally wants a sniper scope on his sandwich😂
You can see the green screen
When I liked it was perfect beacause it turned blue and the dislike was white and it was perfect
Extended barrel and no stock is ussual for codm players
What's with the Maryland flag in the background?
You guys Greg and dimucc look like brother's  or twins
Think about the plan First
How do you make those guns
Perfect cod youtuberd
Actually it’s a double V not a W.. that’s why Hawaii is pronounced with a vvvv sound not a wai sound. Like Ha’vai’E

You should have tutorials on how to make those guns!
That Greg character needs to go into the actual military and see how was guns work if you add a sniper scope the range won't be extended it'll be the same but you can see farther

Greg and dimucc
I love that Greg and Dimucc work together, some of my favorite YT short tubers
Ayo best collab ever
No way him
Lol
Ur friends with Dimmuc?
Epic the two guys who make cod content.
I like the crossover
I never thought Greg Renko and Dimucc would be in the same vídeo😱
he shouldve just said *they say its a meta*
I just realized that they aren’t the same person….
Best Collab ever
Two best YouTubers ever
Perfect collab
Love how there doing video together
Dimucc!!!
Yes! A great colab
I did not expect the dimucc to be here also u 2 R so similar in characteristics
A collab
Play codm and no bans
That's it I'm going to take care of little Timmy once and for all
Do more collabs pls
Wow
But he was talking to Greg ranko
What they are frends
What are the things used to make the guns I can’t remember
The second he said sniper scope
Again
What about a M2HB
Finnaly 2 gaming goats recording together!!!
The cross over
LETS GOOOOOO BEST COLLAB EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think dimucc is green screened
The perfect collab I am evolving
M4 with no stock long barrel is actually s good combo 🤣
U 2 live together?
That one friend who gets the same exact punishment lol
POV your 2 favourite creators collab:
This is the equivalent of NWH when they summoned the spider-men lol
Wait I thought they were the same guy just had a second Chanel
“Don’t make me ban you aswe-” “It was Greg”
I thought they where the same people
Nice crossover
THE BEAT COLLAB
Hi Greg renko
lol great vid
These guys look so similar to me I didn't realize they were different people until I watched it again
I love thissssssss
THE CROSSOVER
I like using a gun that has: No stock Extended barrel Monolothic suppreser Granulated griptape OWC laser

Fire collab
HiS iN yOuR hOuSe

The colab no one knew they wanted
This is the colab we all needed
Hi greg and dimucc
:o pog
You guys look exactly the same
Ye dımmuc ıs gere
How do u pronounce dimucc
The Collab we all needed
Michael could have just said that he's making a troll loadout and not have gotten Greg murdered
I usually see a flag where I’m from, by any chance do you live in that area?
Damn Monday
Best cross over ever
He could just say to dimmuc that tell the owner to call his hacker friend and the Grek comes back cause the hacker don't know he's banned
The moment you realize they Dimucc is actually in Greg's house
Dimooch
omg his a youtuber
Gun nerd here. That rifles has no buffer tube so it effectively doesnt work. Also, he imitated cocking it from the side. Which you actually be done on top at the rear.
Finally I've been waiting for this
YOOOO amazing collab
Well probably because your house looks a little similar
I didn't know you were friends with dimucc too!
Yoooo best colab
Beautiful
I luv dimucc and Greg
Anyone else notice the green screen?
For a while I thought they where the same people
Where is the buffer tube lmao
My loudouts be like pistol + machine gun

The best collab to ever exist
Some guy: Marvel Avegers end game is the best cross over in history Me an intellectual: um actually….
I love these two lmao
Yes they collab yes!!
Wow… two of my favourite skit makers in YT. Just amazing! (Also this might sound like sarcasm but it isn’t.)
Love how the gunsmith is finally getting tired of the wacky guns and is about ready to cap a fool
I don’t think he actually was at Greg’s house cause he looks fake but you never know

Love the collab with Dimmuc and let’s try to get Greg to 3mil by the start of October
The best cros over does'nt exi....
hahaha this was good i love that... it was only a matter of time until he got banned xD
Yesss
Bruh Does he keep making guns from scratch or does he have a whole room ful of them that he just disassembled and made a video with?
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptizeD
I love these collab dimucc is so funny and you two together on a video is so awesome keep up the good work 👍
“The perfect crossover doesn’t exi..”
Lol
the crossover we never knew we needed
Make a gun that scary that too strong if you can do my idea

I love both of y’all videos
The end of a great series bringing many people laughs. Your finally free:)

My god, the Collab finally happened!
AHHH HAAAA
If that’s Greg, whose the gunsmith?

YESSSSSSSSSSS
It's about time the gun shop took action. 😂😂
When we needed him the most he did a collab

Best.Crossover.EVER
Wow another callab lets goo

Don’t make me ban you!    …IT WAS GREG
Best collab ever
finally, we know what what the customization guys canonical name is.. We can rest easy now...
Ayeee you listened to my idea!
Yesss yesss yesss
I knew it would come eventually
I never expected a collab like this.
I got a video idea for the cod customization series, so basically the video starts on like usual and then when greg wants some ridiculous attachments and the shop owner questions about it, and Greg stays there silent, I want the shop owner to actually be patient and wait till greg changes his idea. (You can go on from here)
Hahahahaha
Now this ... This does put a smile on my face
I love the combo of these two
Wait are you roommates or did he drive/go/bike to your place
This is great!
The COLLAB
We need more of this🥵
I love the part where he was cringe      Oh wait there was no part like that
It makes me happier for you to collab
You missed a chance to make the dmr when it was op or make another kilo 141 with these attachments  1m laser, integrated suppressor barrel, no stock 50 rnd mag
Best collaboration ever
The best collabe  ever!!!!
The collab i didn't know I needed
Greg finally has a friend Until he gets banned too that is
They looks like eachother. I was waiting for this video. OMG!
Dimucc is so underrated. Love the collaboration dude

The best collab in the universe
Let's go an amazing colab, especially since they in the area
“Wait, Greg with a G or Greg with a g?” “g.” “With or without the dark blue patterned robe?” “You’re thinking of Graig. Oh, and without the robe. “Isn’t Graig the one with the glasses?” “No, that’s Greig. Graig is the dark blue robe guy. “Ah. I see.”
Shouldve said "Theres no way this is meta!?"
WAIT YOU ARE FRIENDS
Have fun hitting shots with the extended barrel, no stock m4 your holding ;)
Nice new phone Greg
This Collab is fire and Dimuccs video.
He's finally had enough.
Do more of those lol
Noicr
More of these collabs
Tell me a better collab than this
But the main question is: Did the gunsmith kill him? 👀
No way
They’ve finally done it this is a great day
idk but dim looks like he’s green screened
Skit makers assemble!
finally the crossover we were waiting for
🤣
I can't believe they're actually doing crossovers
Best vid ever
honestly, he should have fired the gun and missed because of the lack of a stock.
*kills greg*  Damn that's actually pretty good
Ayyyy
Love it!
Next weapon customization: em2
I used to be a fan but after watching this masterpiece im a whole air conditioner
AWESOOOOOMMEEEE
Lol, I love it when you and Dumicc colab
The sniper scope is the best scope of all 🤣🤣
Another one between my 2 favorite creators
Dont trust anyone with a sniperscope on a non-sniper wepon
Who uses the m4
This is a banger
Hi
Another collab from the mighty skit gods
M4 with extended barrel and no stock was one of the most OG metas in WZ. Until that sniper scope was added on it became actually rigged.
Why does he need a sniper scope on his guns still after he got thousands of sniper scopes
Please do more colabs
Even if he were to deal with Greg he probably couldn’t with that gun 😂😂😂
This is a GOD collab
The perfect collab doesn’t exi-  I saw when Greg was in his cod court case 11 but this time Dimucc actually came to his house that’s amazing! I couldn’t tell last time as they used green screens
Les goo
You are free to kill hes a bot and do more colabs
You about to square yourself up?
Ooh do the vlk rouge
Damn your already close to 3 mil subs
