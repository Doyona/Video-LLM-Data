love the music!
Could anyone please tell me the name of the song?
They have very different styles, but it would be nice to see Conan do a "Travel Man" type episode with Richard Ayoade.
Just started watching!! A year late why don't they do more propaganda!! This is hilarious!! Pee in my pants when conan bought a souvenir in Thailand and asked a vendor to kiss it 😂😂
Me redownloading and paying for max rn
Conan is a truly foreign person
Conan, please come over to the Philippines 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
When is it going to be available in Argentina ??? Come on MAX !!!
I need a podcast with dogfinn and Conan!!!
I was just about to give up. Cash it all in. I am no longer entertained by pop culture. I am a drowning man reaching for something that's sticking out of the water. Conan is something sticking out of the water.
WE NEED MORE. PLEASE VISIT PHILIPPINES CONAN 🇵🇭
CONAN STRONG
Conan makes a great viking.  It's obvious now, but that had never come across my mind until now.
It’s out now and ive watched the norway episode twice so far
Do we have a Conan shortage? Or are we reaching Peak Conan?
Just in. Jay Leno’s new Biography. Entitled “Conan O’Brien Must Go”.
Werner Herzog as the intro sequence narrator is just brilliant! An instant classic!
i cant find this show anywhere and i have hbo max
Conan can’t do no wrong. But to me, those high production values take a bit fun out of it - AND I really miss the laughter of a fellow audience 😌
Can’t wait
It's like a scripted version of "An Idiot Abroad"...
I now know who sings the Staring at the Fjords song in here.
Best thing about the trailer is the song, it’s so disappointing they didn’t use it for the final trailer
Yeah!
This is why Conan is unique
Where do I download conan hit song in Norway?
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Conan O'Palin
I watched every episode!! I have been waiting for this FOREVER!! It cannot stop!! I love it soooooo much!! kudos to Conan!!
😂❤️
I couldn't marry Conan, so I never married❤
Conan is actually singing the theme song in this trailer.
Conan was always at his best when he's doing a remote. This is it!!!
Is it weird that im extremely Jealous that I had no idea that I could have reached out and Skyped with Conan obrian
a must watch!😄
The great Conan O Brien 🙌🏻
You think you can just come back and people will care? What are you a Roman emperor or Kaiser? Which in the Roman-Ecclesiastical pronunciation is actually cheysa
Me paying for the first time a subscription for this channel just to see the show. I love love LOVE Conan 🥇
Today is the day!
If I don't have HBO.... where can I find these full episodes... you tube or where? Please let me know 😊😊 thank you ❤
Does any place on earth have no coffee. Go Conan go.
I subscribed to MAX just for this.
Finally it's premiering tomorrow! I love Conan so much
Conan has a beautiful voice, who'd have thought 😁
Omg, I wasn’t really gonna watch this but this stupid trailer got me hooked now… it looks amazing.
already lmfao team coco 4eva❤
Conan is livin the dream!
Awesome! I love Conan and this show looks like it'll be a great time! Can't wait!
Does Mr. Schlansky come along?
Ugh is this gonna be available in HBO GO Philippines?!😢
When do we get to see jordan again #wheres jordan
I hope it's funnier than this promo
Thinking about subscribing to MAX just for Conan’s new show.  You’re welcome. ❤
That kick to the face made my whole week!!  April 15 2024
10 months ago? Geez
This is one giant sunscreen spf 7,000 commercial……
I CANT WAIT!!!!
Cinemax - odd choice for a new series.
King of Remotes has returned! Hit me up whenever you’re in Singapore Conan!
Damn, i can tell from sneak peek that it’s going to one of the best traveling shows 🎉🎉 more seasons to come please!  Maybe bring Jordan along the way for couple episodes 😂😂😂
How is this guy in his 60s?
I can’t wait!!!!!!
Conan should go to the Philippines
This is gonna be sooooo! Good 👍🏾 yes!
Is it HBO or Max? Is HBO too popular for everyone now? #hotones
Sad. Max isn't available in the Philippines. :(
Oi i wish I hadn't just canceled my damn max.....
Can't wait for this. One of the worst things about covidism, aside from people losing their livelihoods, quitting on life, broken families and experiencing real life dystopia was the fact Conan's show ended. The darkness was real.
I'm looking at the Fjord. There's salmon in the sea. There's oil in the ground. There is not enough for me! Great song!
He’s like Rickie Jarvis but better. (I’m sorry for this comment)
I need this to be 1000000 episodes
I need to know the song 🎶
I literally set a reminder on my Alexa for this lol 😂 I’m so depressed today and to be happy I’ve been just watching all Conan YouTube to feel better
The best travel show ever...I hope. It looks amazing.
I won't watch it without Schlansky.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS WELCOME BACK CONAN!!! RRRRRRRRR!!!! 💋💋💋💋
Conan is the comedic version of the late Anthony Bourdain.  He is definitely a global ambassador.😊
I love this man.
Love
What is Max and how do I find this?
Beyond excited! The king is back 🎉🎉🎉
I have a question: WILL JORDAN SCHLANSKY BE THERE?
when is this airing?
You sleeping on conan’s song. Haaaa haaaaaa 🎵
They have to make that music track available in its entirety. I need it in my life!!!
The 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Conan:  Physically:60 Years Old  Mentally:5 Years Old  Emotionally:7 Years Old  me:  Physically:33 Years Old  Mentally:6 Years Old  Emotionally:4 Years Old  I Can't Wait to Watch This,I Literally Grew up Watching Conan
I would like to see Jordan as a Viking. In battle.😂
Just here for Conan muay thai kicks!!
Literally I cried just now, I am very happy Conan Rules‼️❤️💯🛸👍🏾‼️🎯💯🧠
Obrigado Max !
Man… i’ve been waiting for this 😭
This is the proper way for the Mighty Mighty Conan to vent his creative energies. Also he's just a really funny dude.
i'm so confused how Conan is even real. I've been watching him for 30 years and still think it doesn't make sense when I see him on the telly.
A Conen documentary that feels like a entire session of the show on a movie 🎥 network, so we can say bad words now and Jordan Shlanskey is here, I'm watching 👀 this.
i'm so excited to see this😂😂😂 i loveee Conan and his humor😂😂❤❤
When will it be on PirateBay
Couldn't thank enough man,..... I missed him so so so so much
I can't to watch this! We love you Conan from the Philippines!
Needs to have Jordan with him at all times
He's really the best! Thank you HBO
I would love to see this in a theater.  The return of the king of clean wholesome comedy
No other late night host can do this type of comedy. I can't imagine fallon , kimmel or colbert doing this and for it to be even little bit funny.
You can just drop Conan anywhere in the world and it would be funny.
hey Conan, if ever you're in the Philippines, hit me up!!! :D
The Conan renaissance we all needed.
Who doesn't love Conan? He's such a loving and funny vibe!
Can't wait!
Easily one of the most exciting news I've heard from the entertainment industry in a while!!!
The real question is: where is Jordan Schlansky? Is he the Associate Producer?
I'm going to subscribe to HBO MAx just for this! I love Conan's remotes/Conan without borders. I'm so excited
And he never went
YAAAASSSSSSSS - thank you for bringing Conan back!! He's the king of remotes and I missed these skits he would do out in the wild....amazing move Max!!
First we got the “Our Man In…” series with James May, and now this.  Good times.
Just shows it's never too late for a career change
Can’t wait!
I'm in!
You suckers, this is just an excuse for Conan to go on a paid vacation 😂
I am in Where should I pay
When the f is this comjng
It’s almost been a year without a release date
Conan O’Brien Must Go…on Hot Ones!
this is the first time i've seen this somehow and i listen to the podcast religiously. this made me SO excited I was smiling the whole time!!
YES FINALLY
conan should partner up with karl pilkington.
YES
That spicy Thai food laugh stumbling down the street killed me
And? Where is it?
If youre a fan of Conan, and listen to his podcast, you instantly realize what this show is. I cannot wait.
How is the strike still affecting this?
Eeeeeeee so excited!
Probably coming to HBO in July or something lol
Come on. It’s been 9 months
What’s the name of that song guys ??😂
Will this hurry and come out? I want 10 seasons of this show already. Ever since Bourdain died, my severe wanderlust needs to be helped.
hope jordan is there if he goes to italy or something
I think Conan forgot about this
this will never come out, right? Conan went to HBO what, 5 years ago? How long does it take to produce a show?
Any news on this?
Lookz gr8, love coco
Conan is incredible, they should have incorporated Jordan.
Legend
and more streching
As much as I like Conan doing this, I miss watching him every night. I feel like this is something he can do in the summer break. Give him a sabbatical 6 month every other year for him to do whatever he wants
Let's hope he brought the Max amount of sunscreen...
Ok. When?
I would like Conan to move to Ireland & become a  Youtube travel vlogger there, no entourage, just Conan & a camera all over Ireland.
You should come visit us in Siquijor, Philippines.
I love his total disregard to not wanting to look like a doofus. He embraces weirdness and awkwardness like none other. I've been itching for this show since I heard he was doing it.
No one does it better than conan o b
Well I just found my next reason to stay alive
I have Max and haven't seen this on there
When is this coming out?
I've read that this starts early this year. Anyone seen a date yet? I can't ******* WAIT! 🤪
I love Conan so much.
Just looked up conan on Max and Conan without borders came up. Is it the same?
Waiting …
I seriously hope we get this song soon, sounds like a banger 😂😂
People will have already forgotten about this by now... When are you actually releasing this series, ever? Conan should be just doing this/Without Borders now, that was by far and away the most fun, interesting, engaging and WORTHWHILE thing he has ever made. This podcast business, a vehicle for half billionaires patting one another on the back and advertising globally socially  and economically harmful businesses like amazon is NOT good, and frankly pretty disappointing for someone of Conan's intelligence and worldiness.
Kinda makes me miss Anthony Bourdain. No one did it better...
Kedakai!!! As god made her!
frickin WHEN, Max???
Conan really just literally bring happiness everywhere he goes, love from Vietnam :)
ok.  when?
When though?
I will watch this for a dollar!
Legit question. Does his family get to go with him or do they stay at home while he travels the world?
Has this come out yet?  I wish he did a travel show with Jordan!
This trailer came out eight months ago! Where’s my damn Conan show already, MAX?!
Conan is a world treasure!
its wild I heard of conan signing a deal for a show on hbomax and now i see this trailer 8 months later. I see that it still has not come out? I'm late to the party yet the party has not started.
I genuinely dont know how I missed this. So excited
I didn't expect that the successor of Anthony Bourdain would be Conan
When does it come out????
Easily the funniest late night personality
it's been 8 month!!! And I am waiting ... How much longer? Tell the the date!
This made my year!
apparently he just got back from South America. Anyone know where he went? I'm guessing Argentina as he had several people from the podcast from there
When is this going to air?
I loved Conan.  Very much appreciate all the years of entertainment X's a billion. Can we now PLEASE  move on into the future. Any type of Conan revival ruins my fond past memories,...  Let him go unto thee green pasture*
Conan is saving comedy!!!
I think max has hit a jackpot with this one !! 'Conan remote on a bigger scale' !
I CANT TAKE THIS WAIRTINF ANYMORE
PLEASE RELEASE
IM TIRED OF WAITING. RELEASE NOW.
WHEN IS THIS COMIMG OUT???
cant wait
So is this ever going to get released?
But where’s Jordan? Is he too busy with his various tasks?
No joke, this song goes 😮🎧🎶
It's been 7 long moths...HBO. When will this f____r go?
I’ll be watching these Day One, Max, so thank you!!
CONAN IS BACK ON TV LETS GOOO
How long is going to be until this show comes out? He filmed most of these like 2 years ago now.
I'm crying tears of happiness. Thank you, please take my money.
Jordan Schlansky better make a guest appearance
I love you Conan! Pls swing by the Philippines! ❤
When is this finally released. It’s been 6 months since the trailer
Conan and Craig Ferguson by FAR the best since Letterman left and I think numbers 2 and 3 behind Carson as greatest late night talk show hosts.  Seth Myers is bottom of list well below Carson Daly and Chevy Chase.
Can't freaking wait
Hurry tf up.
But how does one watch this in countries that don’t have HBO max? Has the series started showing? There’s not even been teasers on team coco. So frustrating! from a lifelong Conan fan currently in the Philippines
Ok, no joke, where can I get the song in the trailer.  I must know.
CANT WAIT
I can’t express with how excited I am for this.
Ok the disco Eurobeat soundtrack alone makes me want to watch this series. Pale awkward white dude travel show? Even better.
I love Conan so much! When is this coming out?!
WHERE IS IT ALREADY?!?! 😅
ANNA!
When is this show coming out? Bern no news for too long.
We Love Conan
I Miss Classic Conan The Masterbaiting Bear The Interuppter  the Robot on the Toilet the Year 2000 /3000  but no NBC SCREWED HIM IN 2009 AND LEFT TBS OH CONAN I MISS U
Ay what's good? Give us a release date NOW
I need this show to come out asap
Guys, the writer's strike is NOT over yet. The contract fell through and they've gone back to negotiations. Executives are being totally unreasonable, and they need to come down to Earth so we can finally watch this show
Only thing missing in this is Andy.
But  they must have Jordan
Whenn?
No other host can touch Conan
I hope the show isn't censored like this video. I'm so tired of censorship.
HBO We wanna watch this too 😑💢 from south Korea
Got pretty disappointed when I renewed my HBO Max subscription for this show only to find out that it was not available in Sweden on HBO Max.... Money down the drain.
Hey plse relase in india too.I love Conan O'Brien
Strike is over Conan can finally Go!
Hello whatever hbo is calling itself now. I understand the writer's strike is now over. So when will we get this show? I promise to subscribe once its available.
Please let Jordan and Sona and Andy be your guest star for next one.
As an alien crab creature, I love Conan.
It's like he was destined to do this
I so badly hope we get more Jordan content dear got PLEASE
Must go with Jordan Schlansky?
WHEN
this looks so good
I hope he knows that we just love him for him and that he doesn't always have to ham it up for the cameras. He is such a kind and fun dude.
im still waiting...
WHEN IS THIS BEING RELEASED
Conan want to see you in São Paulo,Brasil. ❤ love you mate
Id kill for having a fraction of conans personality and class.
Yo I can already tell this is going to be great. Better get started with seasons 2 and 3 right away.
Can’t wait 😂
Conan must go? Where?
Name one thing he isn't capable of, I'll be waiting
we should use him as a diplomat
O M G !!! I can't believe Conan finally got a travel show!
I was there when Conan was assassinated on the grassy knoll.
omg i was praying for years conan would do this again. I just finished watching his italy, korea, and japan travels for the 3rd time last week....and now this!!!!!
this is soo goood
when is the release date MAX?!
Omg why am I just seeing this?! I loved Conan’s travel clips on his channel. This new series is going to be 🔥
Conan is a living legend.
this is gonna be great
Wow he must have so much fun going all over the world to meet fans! Such a fun guy
Jordan???
WHEN IS THE RELEASE DATE WHEN?!
End the strike and let's go...can't wait nymore
Conan in America and Graham Norton in the UK.. These are the only two  good english speaking talk show hosts in the world currently .. period! No one else comes even remotely close..
I feel its scripted. I will bebvery disappointed it is. The only reason conan is funny because of his spontaneous comedy
I am obsessed with him and his staff (no, no not that one). I meant team coco as a whole, I love Sona, Andy, Jordan and everyone and i don’t even live in US.
Conan used to be so funny back in the day, unfortunately he lost it at some point.
When is soon?
wow, for a second I thought the guy at 0:38 was Matt Shea from Vice. This guy seems way cooler than Matt Shea though.
When?!  Cuando ?! 언제?! 😢
What song is in the background?
Please release this!
WHERE IS JORDAN
If only was on a better streaming service id watch this but not paying for max not worth it
Where the F is Jordan!
I watch this trailer every so often to bring jo to myself:D
This song needs a music video
i can't wait! Conan is the best!
I want Conan to tour the world with Jordan!
Maybe next season Conan can come visit me in the mystical land of Salem, Oregon
where is Jordan?
🙏 thank you HBO, this is truly a gift. Bringing in the  true king of late night
conan is just a gift and a blessing to humanity.
If there aren't some Jordan Schlansky surprise cameos, however, it will all be for naught.
Release date?
One of the first shows in years I've been genuinely excited for
Yes! Finally!!! When?
Conan should def get into live streaming, he'll do great IRLs
No Jordan Schlansky?
lets goooooooo this brings a sense of good vibes peer usual
I wonder what Jordan’s various duties will be for this show?
Conan stayed normal during 2020 you know what, and didnt alude to it, which why i only watched him him end of that year...the rest were cringy and reminding me of the nonsense and promoted nonsense Conan's genuine spontaneity is heartwarming
Conan the Conqueror (of remotes, and basically all talk shows in general)
love you Conan greetings from El Salvador!
I can die a happy man
These are going to be great!
THE GOAT IS BACK!
Finally! I having been waiting for this for sooooo long! miss you, Conan!
Love Conan! The F**k Force Five are a bunch of hacks.
The last late-night comedian who isn't a hack.
But where’s Jordan?
omg this is such a good trailer. I'm totally a Conan fan, I love him as a human being and entertainer. Yes, and we have HBO MAX :D! When is it coming?
Conan is in my dreams believe it or not I don’t know why
And I must watch
the GOAT
its a shame it cant be released until the strike is over
im IN!.. cant wait..
so effing stoked
Finally!!!!!!🎉
Super excited can’t wait, i mean hes the king of late night!
This looks exquisite! When is the release date?
💓💓💓
Can't wait! Finland loves you Conan!
Red grandpa must go to new place and scare: now streaming on movies box near you!!!
Is it not out cause of Writers strike? I dunno why I thought 4 episodes would be out.
Yes please, and thank you.
Horned helmets were a 19th invention. Booo! Everything else: Yaaaaaaaaaay! A very impressive beard even.
Yes!!! I've watched everyone on conans remote or travel videos multiple times each. I can't wait for this 😊
Conan is the GOAT of late night hosts.
I love Conan!
_BUT,_ *WHEN????*
@WB: This is the one and only case where non-scripted fan-service programing is going to work. Do spend the next decade trying to replicate the inevitable success of this show. Conan is 1 of a kind.
Sometimes fan-service works 🤝
So glad 😅to see him in another show
Youtube!? Why did it take TWO MONTHS for you to recommend me a new show with The Elder Statesman of Comedy, the great Conan O'Brien!?
I need this now
CONAN IS THE GOAT.
this cant be reallllllllll nooooo
This is cool! Is it a Michael Palin phase? Other than the Asian locales, Conan is connecting with the pasty white sides of culture.😅
Conan in his Viking Era
I wish the writers strike could be resolved soon…would be nice for this show to be released..
Noice!🎉
YES
I love Conan, can't wait to see this!!! I rewatch clips from Conan without borders all the time. Best late night host ever, hands down
I love Conan in Foreign settings 😂😂😂
The best TV host
It's exactly what we wanted. Conan is a mood.
The soundtrack is really addicting.
put conan anywhere on the planet with anyone and he can make people smile. this is going to be amazing, plus it’s got that HBO quality cinematography
But where is Jordan? :/
Bro’s doing side quests.
I want conan to visit the north or South Pole. I would even go with him just to see that
😂
Sucks that the executives have to be nonsensically greedy and are causing this to be delayed :(
How many episodes and is it only Norway and Thailand?
I've got goosebumbs! Take my money!
Song title?
I am so excited for more new Conan remotes. I watch all his old ones at least once a year. Peak entertainment.
I hope there is audience laugh in the final product
As an Egyptian, I am so excited and happy! I’ve been a fan of Conan for over 10 years now and I truly wish him the best!
Conan is a gift to the world.
Simply. Yes!
Conan is versatile.. you can put him literally anywhere and still be funny 😂
I'M SO EXCITED!!!
I need more Conan in my life.
I remember back when most of the comments under Conans and Jordans remote trips were, "We need a show where Conan just travels and fools around". Guess its finally happening. Hope Jordan will also be featured in one of the eps.
song is an absolute BANGER
Looking forward to this Conan is funny was sad to see his show ended.
Houston we have a problem. No sight of Jordan from this trailer.
Conan is the self-appointed worldwide ambassador, we didn't know that we needed - but we definitely do!
we just love to watch conan back in television where he belongs
If you don't team up Conan and Steven Yuen again, you are missing a huge opportunity.
This is the „WE WANT JORDAN SCHLANSKY IN IT“ button.
Conan is perfect for this new iteration of Travel - Vlog? Like a sublime intertwixting of Anthony Bourdain, Andrew Zimmern, and Gordon Ramsay - but he cannot cook “probably” to save his life. Can’t wait!
Conan is a doctor.
Hype
its sad and depressing that Conan has gotten old and his talk show ended. But at the same time he is still coming up with fresh new ideas that are timeless. Plus we can all admit all the remotes were the best part of of the show ^^
Yes
My subscription is Nerflix. But im gonna watch this!! Arrrrrrrrr!!  The New Pirate Era has begun!
Conan would make a great Shepherd in season 3 of Raised by Wolves....So when is that coming out, Max? Huh?  #RenewRaisedByWolves
conieeeeeeeeeeeee jajajajaja
Better be seeing some Schlansky
😂deleting comments telling you to put it out is a weirdo thing to do 😂
I hope jordan is travelling along with you
Conan is the best and funniest show man ever, I wish also best sidekick Andy participate in this project
Really hyped for anything Conan O'Brien
And thats all the best bits
Yesssss, always love Conan Remote
Finally
is jordan schlansky in this series?
About time!
This looks dope
When does it come out?
The show looks amazing, I hope we get to see Jordan Schlansky as well, or at least be assured he is back in "work" with full salary.
Conan: loses talk show Also Conan: "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine"
Came wandering over from the podcast. I listen while working remotely--best thing ever. Conan must come to VA Beach!
CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN
Conan is one of the funniest and coolest guys ever
WB Discovery shouldn't have licensed MAX content over to Bell Media in Canada.  We can't even be certain if they'll air this on Crave.  There's alot of MAX exclusive content that they skip over.
Anybody know when this will finally be available?!?!
when is this coming out! I live Conan!
I would love that he visits the heart of south america (geografically speaking)... Bolivia!
When is this coming out?
The fact that conan can be taller than viking, he is really a stork
NOOO WWAAAYYY
This seems like the show Conan was born to make. He's the only talk show host that I truly feel could genuinely connect with anyone, while poking fun at his own ridiculousness, but also doubling down on it.
Lord Conan is back......to conquer the world
He is Norway.
I somehow feel sad
Release the series already plzz
that's awesome.... I remember hearing he was coming to HBO max when his TBS show wrapped... Glad it is actually happening...
This looks amazing, when is it coming out?
Back to Armenia!   Redo the shepherding bit!
Where is Sona?
Will I watch? One hundred percent. Conan is hand down the best late night show there was and seeing him now do the best part of his show.. remotes but full time? I love it. I am hoping they decide to bring Jordan for one.
Basically Conan: without borders: the show
Unless he already knew I like how Will Ferrel predicted Conan’s HBO max show and made a farewell message for it already
This was freaking good trailer !!!!! Love it !
What does soon mean
This looks amazing! I hope Jordan shows up in some of these.
This is a dream come true lol
Can't wait! Hope he comes to Peru one day ❤
oh my god! How i love this idiot hahahaha
😢 He just did an interview, and because of the writer strike. The show is delayed, they're not filming right now.
finally after waiting for years.
There's something about him singing in the background that makes you emotional. Can't quite describe it but it's almost like he's close to completing his career journey.
This just made my day!!!! Wooo hoo! Its a great day to be a conan fan!
I hope he will visit Seoul again someday, which was legendary. Great trailer
This is a great concept for a show. Conan's remotes are his best stuff.
What a time to be alive!!!!
Yesss… this looks like *Conan without borders* on steroids 💪
I hope they do the thing where they play this in front of a live audience and add the laughs in post! Just makes it such a feel good video
anyone know when this airs?
cant even tell us when?
Alright but where is Sona and Jordan
Can't wait!
YES FINALLY <3
Total war music
Finally!!!!!!
when is this going to premier?
I should have known he’s coming in Thailand, dang it. 😭
Thank you HBO 😊
OMG IM SO EXCITED
The King is back! 🔥🔥
OMG. Yes please
hello
Never found Conan to be that funny.
Im excited.... he should ho here in the Philippines
An exploration of this giant, fascinating world with my favorite comedian of all time. I am *all* in.
wow. love this surprise. only thing is that Max is always super vague when these shows will start.
its finally here
Oh man yes. Yes yes.    Yes
Conan is King. I'm so excited to watch this I hope I get to meet him some day
I want to watch this.
Really wish I had Max! Conan is the best <3 Loved Conan without borders, so I'm sure this will be just as good :D
Leg man walking
I AM SO EXCITED AAAAAAAAAAAA
Gotta see the Norway episode. Since a friend of mine met Conan at Opera Cafe in Bergen while he was filming there
YEAAAASSSSSSSS PURRRRRRRRRR
FINALLY! A travel show with Conan!
omg i made it to the good ending
Absolutely, YES!
Finally.
I MUST HAVE THIS SONG 🎵
This.  This is what the world needs!
is Jordan coming as well ?
YEEEEEES!
needs more Jordan
Damn from his show now to Max! Must see!
Love the fact that Conan just used the song he recorded as the videos BGM
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SONG?😡
I MISSED HIM SO MUCH
Y am I now seein this
Please include Jordan Schlansky in this show!!!!
Yesss!!! Everyone wants this! THANK YOU CONAN
I love u Conan
I just subscribed to HBO just for this
Could someone please tell me where can I watch the full series...??
#MYPEOPLE ❤
Finally i thought this project would never get done
Pleaaaase HBOMax let this masterpiece come to Brazil !!!
where can i watch this???
I love this song lol I hope they release a full version
This gives me comedian version of anthony bourdain travels vibes and I LOVE IT
ok when does he pay a visit to timothy olyphant
We're not worthy!!!
JUST finished listening to Needs a Friend with the Norwegian fish farmer! Super funny to see Conan actually going there!
This is going to be good. This edit is 10/10
Oh heck yes. Finally!
DOES ANYBODY HAVE THE RELEASE DATE? 😢❤
so there's no conan must go to italy with jordan?
dear david zazlav: fire the person who told you max is a good name. it is not. thanks for firing the CNN guy.
I absolutely love how he stays so down to earth. In my opinion one of the funniest men alive! Greetings from sweden
This looks so entertaining. Go Conan!!  ❤ ❤ ❤
Anyone know what happened to the weekly night show they were going to do? It would be nice to see Andy and the writers included in something.
Get back to Italy and take JORDAN!
😏 Should have included Jordan Schlansky 🤷‍♂
awesome , these are so fun to watch
I need this OST rn!!!!!
One of the best comedians of all time!!
Why tf did the song slap so hard
omg, this will be the greatest show ever.
I'm in!  Love it when Conan is on the road.
LETS GOOOO
Conan is the reason why I started watching Late night television. I stopped watching when he stopped.  Dude just seems like an ACTUAL funny person that doesn't have to read a script to be funny.
I'm so hype for this
i love conan, that ginger clown
Man, I will definitely watch that!
Wow… how bad the world needed this, thank you Conan 🙏🙏🙏
The goat is back! 👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥
Yes, but where is JORDAN??
Conan dressed as a Viking is the most perfect portrayal visually of anything I have ever seen. I wish I could afford MAX!
I am so overjoyed!! Could not be more excited for this.
After the late Anthony Bourdain, this is probably the only other travel show i'd like to watch in my lifetime.
LETS GOOO
Where's Andy? 😢
This is brilliant. ❤
the madness level of Conan is unreachable
finally!! will be worth the wait to wait some more
*_Conan Needs To Stop_*
I will never understand how Conan lost the prime slot to Jay Leno.  Conan has more funny in his pinkie than Jay has in his entire body.  People who prefer Jay to Conan have a terrible sense of humor.  Conan was done dirty.
he should've come to my city in norway
When we said we wanted to see him travel, THEY LISTENED. This is how you do it Netflix. Take notes. ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR AUDIENCE.
So soooooo stoked for this !! All love for Conan. We've been waiting. ❤ Love from India ❤️🇮🇳
YES!!!!!!!
When can we watch this?
vikings had no horns on helmets thats clear to everyone in europe, also conan is irish, his ancestors were r*ped by vikings
And he’s back!
Awesome! But where is Jordan Schlansky?!
so cute
YES CONAN
This could be his best work
When does this come out!
I love that the premise is "famous guy goes places to see if he gets recognized" 😂
The king.
YES! My favorite Conan bits were his remote hes really in his element with strangers
ONLY FOUR EPISODES??????????????
yes! ive been waiting!
Will I be able to watch in the UK?
Where is Andy?
Conan..did you go to all these beautiful places without Jordan.?!!
conan is in his letterman semi retired phase lmao
Now all that’s left is clueless gamers. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!
YES 😭
Finally!❤❤❤
Hey guys anyone know the name of the song Conan was singing to?
Is there still gonna be a laughtrack tho? 👀
If Jordan Schlansky isn't in this series, we riot.
This is the most wholesome thing I've seen all year. Just sending Conan meeting the fans he met.
CANNNOT WAITTTTTTTT
I was hoping to see Jordan somewhere in this trailer
I guess this is why I have to watch ads or pay more for "Max"!
I love this man.
An ironic travel show that derived from a podcast featuring a comical personality? That reminds me an awful lot of An Idiot Abroad with Karl Pilkington.
yes yes yes yes yes !
Music doing a hard carry on this trailer
Can’t wait
I WILL SUBSCRIBE TO HBO MAX JUST BECAUSE OF CONAN. GOOD FOR HBO TO INVEST IN QUALITY CONTENT. READ THIS CONTENT MANAGERS.
Oh, my life was not in vain. Conan is back! 🎉
This just made my year! Conan deserves the best
The best thing about this sneak peak ? NO SONA !!!!!!
conan please come to the Philippines! let's eat balut, a very tourist friendly delicacy.
THIS. IS. AMAAAZIIIIING.
I love this man. Even when he's old and in a retirement home, I want retirement home remotes. 🤣
The Return of The King 🧡 Late night about to be saved.
I am so excited for this
Smart—he’s very funny on his international trips and it isn’t bogged down by vapid celebrities and weak jokes written by woke staff.
The fact that Conan will go to every nook and cranny of the world but won't come to India pisses me off! HBO, I'll be his personal tour guide in Delhi, just get him here!!!
So basically Conan is doing side quests now.  I dig it.
I was smiling during the whole video 😅
how do you watch in the UK?
The show must go on 😎
I re sub to max again because of this
This was the lead up to Diablo 4 I've been looking for!! Go now young traveler, and seek more friends <3 Good luck
LET'S GOOOOO!!
Where is Jordan Schlansky?!
Road Conan is best Conan.
We need Jordan schlanky in these !
Oh, I brought the same souvenir as Conan at the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.
Now this is worthy of a sub
I'm just grateful that Jordan Schlansky is no longer on a reduced wage and is back working. hahaha
Can Conan host SNL? I think it would be worth it
Conan showing up to Jeremy Clarkson's farm would be amazing
Not gonna lie, I'm only gonna watch if Jordan Schlansky makes some appearances.
ok wait this is trying too hard to be modern
Why is the song actually good
This is going to be epic. I'm subbing to HBO for this shizzle
His Conan without boarders series was incredible. So happy they are expanding on it and making a whole show around it. I love Conan and can’t wait to watch this
Where's Jordan??
i love conan
Conan is one of the artists I would actually pay to see whatever he does
love Conan!
^
Conan singing the track makes it infinitely more hilarious 😂
I love Conan
Can't wait!  I started laughing at the opening scene of the river when the music started before Conan even appeared!
I'm so excited for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When does this air?
YESSSSSSSS
Conan Forever
Finally HBO! ❤
Waiting for FuckBoy Conan series. #HesDownToFuck
A humble request to Conan to come to India! His legion of fans await! (Which given it's India isn't that many)
The man. The myth. The legend.
Imagine at the very end of the trailer, it cuts to black...   and Jordan Schlansky pops up
FINALLY THE LEGEND RETURNS
I wouldn't mind a couple of hollowood stars cameos in the different region hes gonna be in like if he's in Denmark he meets Mads Mikkelsen etc.
THIS IS WHAT WE WANTEDDDDD
YES! 😂🎉 I’m so excited!
This is the great news we've all been waiting for. I've been watching Conan since I was 7 or 8 years old in the late 90's and I still watch old clips all the time. We love you, Coco!
The best HBO MAX has
Come to India
Needs more Schlansky.
Was it not required for Jordan to come along?
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!
not gonna lie. that song is a banger
Good lord I’m excited.
As a Norwegian, I don't really care about all these late night shows, but Conan's late night show was something different. Conan just has this unique and honest personality. I was sad to see him leave his late night show, but it wasn't to end things. It was simply to transcend into something larger.
HE's the BEST .. I missed him so much!!
how do we get updates on this show?
DAMN IM SOO EXCITED!
Conan O'Brien is as likeable as Bill Murray wishes he was.
I'm unbelievably excited for this
I will subscribe to Max for this
This show has been pushed to 1:30 am
Conan is my favorite
Omg I CAN'T WAIT!!!
I am huge Conan fan and loved his adventures on the Conan O'Brien Show. I cant wait for this!! 🤗🤗
I hope Jordan makes a few of the trips
very excite
Wow. One of the greatest performers of our time. If anyone out there missed Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, you need to find and watch it. Changed my perspective on his humor. He's just as addicted to entertaining me as I am to being entertained by him. We have a wonderful synergy.
I love all of conans remote segments I can’t wait to watch this
This took way too long after his show stopped airing, it's missing something with a lack of a live audience reaction, and it looks to scripted. This is gonna flop hard. Sorry Conan.
I love Conan O'Brien's brand/style of comedy. I'm so happy the Conan team has teamed up with the talented people at HBO Max. Great job everyone! I look forward to enjoying your work. <<thumbs up>>
Just take Jordan Schlansky along with you man
My hero is back! actually no. I just want him to entertain me. Youtube is better with Conan.
Words cannot describe how happy this makes me! 😁
This is going to break records
Omg yessssss
Does this mean Jordan has a job again or will he still be doing those amazing Cameos and blaming Conan for being unemployed?
Wheres Jordan btw?
What a life.
Yessss! I love dude!
He looks more like a scandinavian than the actual Scandinavian even without the roleplay costume
Yo, Why did he leave Finland out?
This is a dream come true
FINALLY !!! ... and if they get Jordan to come it will be diamond !
'Conan without Borders' was always my favorite segment so I can'twait for this
Anthony Bourdain walked so Conan could run
Yes Please!
Whooo!!
Goat ❤
YES!!!! I loved it when Conan went to different countries, they were so beautiful!
release the song PLEASE
A schlansky sighting would’ve been the cherry on top.
I love that the theme song is Conan’s horrible singing, but it sounds awesome.
WOW YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! his travel specials were always my fav, I'm SO jazzed for this!
I come here often to express how much I need this show to happen now.
Waiting for it. I hope Jordan Schlansky can also join for an episode :D
Love Conan to the Max!
I’ve heard almost every Conan Obrien needs a friend and this is gonna be absolutely hilarious
Watching an Irish person dress up as a viking makes him look rather frail.
I miss an idiot abroad
ummmm..... i have trying to not sub HBO for a while now... but I cant resist this
I couldn't imagine any other late-night talk show host doing all the thing's Conan has done throughout his show. Conan is so such and entertaining and charismatic person, that calling him a tv host is just a big understatement, he's an entertainer.
Danhausen get ready for the visit?!
YYYYEEESSS finally
Will it be available on HBO Max or just the Max? The latter not released in my country yet.
Looks great! When is this coming out?
@TeamCoco please release the Norwegian pop song as a single
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
If you have Disney+ will this be on there?
I am so happy Conan keeps doing what he is  the best at!
This man never ceases to amaze~  *>!<><><*
finaLLY!!!
this is gonna be GOLD!
I am so excited for this! 🎉
“Max” is the dumbest name they could have picked.
Hopefully get posted to youtube but i doubt it. Ill never get to see these.
I dearly hope that I can be as active, physical, and quick witted as Conan when I get to 60. Dude still looks and acts young wild and free.
I have been waiting for this *cries blood* finally Conan in his element!
I can't wait to watch this on the new app HBO Ax, wait it's changed again HBO X, oh and Again. HBO Y. Z, K, L M O... Please stop I can't keep downloading these apps I just want to watch Game of Thrones
Favorite talk show host of all time. i was fortunate enough to see his show multiple times live. definitely days to remember
Hmm…riffing on a theme perfected by Hammond, May and Clarkson.
u the man man
Conan visits rich people in other countries  Why does the trailer not say when this will air?
Needs Jordan with him
So sad he did not visit Danhausen and did some wrestling, but there is always room for a second season!
Where's Jordan though
OoOOoooooOooOoooOOOOOOooooo Conando! Finally another take of  the Remotes!, fk Yeah!
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
song is lit bro
I have a cat named Conan... so yeah, I'm a fan... and yes, the cat has massive hair. This fills me with utter joy. I hope the strike is resolved soon!
Conan's remote segmets but make it Amazon's Grand Tour 😉😆
it is about time!!
Conan’s remote segments were HILARIOUS and I adored him in Conan Without Borders. I still watch them to this day.  Guess I’m getting an HBO max subscription…
Another glorious day for the President of Finland.
Looking forward to this. Been a fan of Conan for a while. Much love, from the UK.
His voice is the background music... What more can you ask? Onwards!
Well the next chapter of Conan gold has begun.
Exclusive travel show from Coco!! Heavens have heard our prayers. I love Conan
If Conan doesn’t come to India soon, i might do something crazy ….. I’m open to suggestions
There is something about that song.
Conan is JUST AMAZING…!!! Some day I’ll get to watch his show in person. Get Conan, Kevin Hart, Bill Hader and Roy Wood Jr.  in a movie…..
Oh, I love it! Thank You Conan and the Gang! ❤
Genius idea!  I love it can't wait.
i need to renew my HBO max subcription
When is he going to have a show not about himself.. SMH.
YAAAAY
I cant wait for this!!! Love COCO!!!!
OMG amazing, my fav Conans episodes are when he travels. This will be so good.
please conan come to indonesia
The day has finally come, I'm sure many of us have been anticipating his return on hbomax ever since his talk show ended.
This looks fantastic :D
Conan is the best.
What a privilege 🎉
im so happy
Yeaaah! Time for Norway. We finns had our time with Conan.
Who is Max?
Amazing! I am excited for this!
Hope Conan visit Taiwan
Thank you HBO max for doing this... I love it whatever conon does is going to be entertaining and comedy gold
when?
i hope there will some episodes with Conan and Jordan together again traveling XD
After Conan left, there hasn't been any good talkshows left to watch for me. Conan was and still is the best. For me. It's my opinion. Not talking for the entire world.
Conon O'Brien and Grand Tour (Top Gear) crews should a travel show together.
CONAN IS THE BEST , LOVE FROM HONG KONG  ❤
Been waiting for so long, finally!!!!!
whaaaaat?! now we should treat the casual "see you one day" chat in his podcast seriously. Team Coco really did it!
I was really excited until I read the description... just 4 episodes that rehash the travel he's already done? this content is extremely low-hanging-fruit but hey I guess you gotta' do something during a writers strike
YAY!!
When is this available on max?
YESSSSSSSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉
i'm so happy
Yes
YES YESSSS
Jordan's finally employed again.
Who would’ve thought that Conan at his best would only come after he left the late night game?
Yessss dude
i would love for it to involve a certain fake italiano
I want my midlife crisis to look like this
This looks bad.
If Jordan is involved ill watch :)
The most down to earth celebrity. I hope to see Jordan Schlansky too
Oh my god the fans on COBNAF! Its coming! And the remote is coming together again! I’m so thrilled. So so thrilled. This is top notch as John Krasinki mentioned in COBNAF, “funny + hyper intelligent” comedian. And this sneak peak is so awesome and thoroughly captured my heart and warmth. Looking forward to this series!
What a legend like 100 years old and still keep going, impressive.
You guys know Conan O'Brien is probaly an alien 😆
It is missing one thing, starts with J ends with ordan Schlansky
omg so excited to watch this
I've been waiting C
Conan plus a Drone, what a world we live in.
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
When?
It's about time!! Can't wait to see this!!
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I needed a win at this point, thanks Conan
Where is Jordan? I don't see him doing various tasks.
Shut up. Must watch! Now!!!
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!! LFG!!!!!
Where's the Swedish-German?
When will it be available?
That song Conan starts singing at 0:49...when's it coming to YouTube and/or Spotify?
Where's Schlantsky??? Although, I can't wait either way but...
Song link?
A whole series of what i loved about every Conan show, the outings!  Loving it!
someone needs to tell these celebs to retire, they really don't need to hang around for 50 years.
i would love to meet this gigantic ginger person
Where is Jordan Schlansky?
does anyone know the name of the song playing in background?
no Jordan? come on...
Jordan Shlansky better be in this
That song he sang is a banger 😂
This is what the world needed.
I really hope Jordan Schlansky is a part of this
omgosh THIS is the conan show weve always needed!
OMGGGGG!!! SO EXCITED
I just hope Conan runs into Jordan in Italy! 😂
It looks like "Best ever food review show" but with Conan.
OMG!!! YIPPEE!!! When? How? I'm in!!!
I CANT WAIT!!! TAKE MY MONEY HBO!!!
From the trailer they nailed it , it's exactly what conan does best, he doesn't need to interview celebs he is larger than most of them anyway.
CANNOT WAIT! I’ve missed Conan soooomuch! Hope Jordan will make an appearance too.
The music really kills this ad. oh what? It's Conan's song..  Oh....
Absolutely can't wait! Thank you Conan  and your staff for making this happen it's absolutely what the people need 🙏 Sincerely!
CONAF fan here and I was wondering how long it would take him to follow-through on his promise to see all the people he spoke to on the pod. And here it is! 🤩👏 Thanks to MAX for making this a reality 🥰👌 Can't wait to watch! Hopefully there will be a way for non-US residents to consume this (seeing as the premise of the show is global, I would hope that it's available to multiple countries....  even if it is just via YT).
must go? is that because there were no bathrooms there??
When you realize Conan is singing
HOW SOON IS "soon" HBO !😭😭😭and Yessss I just recently listened to the podcast episode where he talks to the Norwegian guy!😂🔥
Conan has always been the best! I cant wait for this show
I can't wait!!!
Oh finally
No one would be surprised if Jordan Schlansky popped up shopping at the floating market speaking fluent Thai.
finnally the king is back
Has someone found the song he sings?
Conan will go everywhere in the world, but NOT Turkey because his assistant is Armenian. He should go to Turkey to talk to Armenians living there and the biggest rock start Hayko Cepkin who is also happens to be an Armenian.
I got introduced to Conan from his remote segments and was shocked when it stopped thank god the 🐐 is back at it again
So, the reluctant traveller, but with Conan, and with more "bits". I'm in.
wowww!! been waiting for this!!!  The best host ever!!
Here's hoping for a cameo from Forss Fagerstrom.
Where is Jordan?
They could release this show absolutely uncut and unedited and i'd still watch it.
I was smiling through the whole trailer. Conan is treasure.
So there is a god afterall
Saw this while watching his without borders show. So stoked. 🎉
This is exactly what I wanted Conan to do full time!!! After the success of Conan without borders , this was a no brainer!!😇😇😇
Dang so excited for this what a good idea!
Yes!!!! I'm so excited!!!!!
can't wait to watch it !! i love Conan !!!
Time to renew HBO!!
its Conan the barbarian
Sad we have to wait for the striking writers to get it together before the series will be released. God knows how long that will take
I'll get Max just to watch this.
Conan is the best, period.
Who is Max?
this world need more conan.  never enough.
Fine.... *opens wallet *
Anthony Bourdain is smiling from Heaven
Finally, something good coming out
I love Conan Remotes! Can’t wait for this
id prefer a stephen colber tmust go vid  instead- biggest propagnada shill there is on late night and just a piece of chit to boot also- neer was funy even on jon stewrt- Kimmel is also the biggest poiece of chit on TV now with pure on TDS  after 3 years so far
must watch!!!!!
If theirs any celebrity out there that definitely deserves his own travel show, it’s this guy
god this looks terrible
Reel State was here.
I love what Conan is doing and becoming, he's sort of like discovering what life is really about and just exploring every nook and cranny of it with humor and insight. Really interesting face he's in, if you watch his old talk shows you can see how great he was it interviewing and setting up the guests no matter who they were, that's very unique in the arrow that he was a talk show host. So he subvertly broke new ground in a way those before him hadn't. So I'm excited to see what innovations he creates going forward with his own
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Max is a horrible brand
YES CONAANNN!!!!
I love it! Is the song available on the music streams?
What I love about Conan other than he's funny is that he's smart. He knows there are always boundaries especially with other people's culture.
Stoked for this! Also, love Conan's singing in the background track lol
i hope jordan schlansky in it as well
sooo hyped for this, please make more than four episodes!
Here we go
I cannot wait to be watching this. I may call Soonia over so we can have all the laughs and roasts about our comedy Boss man:D
omg i hope sona is in an episode!!
Ever since that trip to Korea, you know Conan was made for travelling content.
Conan the goat 🐐
Where is Sona? If Sona's not in this then I dont want to watch.
another loop for me to get lost into
Jordan will have various essential tasks and numerous production-related travel to do.
conan is not complete without the crew jordan and Sona
This is basically Conan going on paid vacation. So it's a must watch.
Brilliant - all those podcasts where the fan asks Conan to their home - and he delivers.  Must have been a lot of fun.  I hope he goes to the Lizzy Borden house with Sona and Matt..
YES SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER
Looks amazing, finally something worth watching!!
four episodes?  hardly a series
Beyond excited for this.. thank you everyone
Well... Looks like I'm getting hbo
Conan is the greatest in showbiz
I was afraid the HBO show was never going to happen. This is great news.
Jordan Schlansky better get a cameo
HBO max better be available in the Philippines once this releases  I MUST SEE CONANNN
this makes me so happyyyy
TEAM COCO since day 1.
Please tell me Jordan is a part of this
the king of all hosts
Is this the "variety show"?  Or is this a new show in addition to the variety show?  Either way more Conan, the better
Yes.
Coman sucks
I am exciteddddd ❤❤❤❤❤
It’s so cool how he uses the people he meets on the podcast episodes for the show! I’m so excited!
Thank GOD!
This is gonna put this kid on the map
This will be epic!
🔥
I'll be honest...the title scared me.  Like great! We have to cancel Conan because he touched some interns butt 😫  Thank goodness it wasn't that.
i liked when the remotes were on the show and you could hear the audience laughter in between segments. I feel like these shows where conan goes places are just a little too scripted and on the rails.
Watch Conan, Stop Wars.
Great!!!
OH. MY. GAWD.
dang i hate it when trailers dont share a release date
OMG Exactly what we needed 😭 I literally watched every Conan episode there is and this is what we have been waiting for 😢🥹💙
Max...What a dumb stream service name.
HE BACK!!! The funniest dude alive is back ladies and gentlemen
Nice
Can’t wait!!!
Yes! Conan!  Needs more Sona though.
I'm not crazy about the concept of Conan visiting fans, I don't care about the fans and don't listen to their segments on the podcast. I'm sure he can recapture the remote magic though, can't wait to see it!
IM SOOO READY
Well...a pretty horrible trailer...but this is what conan does best - just riff with ordinary people. It's a bit weird seeing him with a budget though .
YES! YES! A THOUSAND TIMES YES! Conan without borders just got bigger and better! Can't wait to watch this as soon as it premieres. ❤️
Oh my god, I just found out abt this!!!
Stolen from James May
It's about time!
Love it. But just so you know, if we don't see Jordan at least one time in the series, we riot.
Yes!  The return of Conan!
Finally...
Approved. Please do more.
All the people in the comments saying they getting hbo to watch This 😂😂😂😂. It’s gonna be on MAX not HBO.
tune´s a banger
Honestly, about damn time soneone turns him into a viking.
Yes yes yes, finally!!!
Can't wait for Conan O briens new remotes
HBO Max was already confusing name, wtf is Max? 😂
I kinda want an audience laughing to the antics.
nothings better than a ginger man going to foreign places
Steven Yuen better make an appearance.
I have been waiting for a Conan show since he went off air and then to podcast I’m so excited
Always liked Conan so much more than other late night guys, Super Excited he gets his own show now!
no matter what, i am watching this, Conan is THE BEST
They must have a Jordan schlanksy appearance somewhere down the line planned. Prob in season 2, when they go to Italy again.
Maybe this time Forss Fagerstrom will finally open the door.
Haha this looks great!
LEGEND
When the world needed him the most he returned, the man, the myth, the legend!!!
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!!! It's literally just an entire show of his remotes :D
where is jordan schlansky?
Pull The LEVER!
THANK YOU HBO I LOVE U SO MUCH
I always love me some Conan.
Yassss need me some Conan ❤
hope it will succeed... we love you conan
FINALLY
Cannot wait for this. I still have the time article about him, "the come back kid". An inspiration
There are only two people I trust to do travel docs, and one of them was Bourdain. I deeply adore Conan, and will treat this four-episode excursion with the delight it deserves, and will no-doubt be left wanting more. Love it.
i hate that i'm already addicted to that background music and i hate that i'm gonna 100% stream it if it ends up on spotify
Y’all should put the release date lol
I cannot wait until the episodes are out!
Looks like the best travel show since No Reservations and the Travel Channel became the ghost channel
HBO is going to make so much money off of this.  Conan is a money machine!!!
!!!!!!!!!!
This really needs Jordan.
Can’t wait!
As a pod listener, this so awesome and full circle. Love that he actually came to visit the fan guests from the Pod.
This is one of the reasons why Conan is the best talk show host and why he's so beloved around the world. None of the current prime time talk show hosts would do or can do what Conan can do.
Real question is: will Jordan and Sona be going with him?
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Overdue!!!!!!!! 🥳
that soooooooong
Conan without Borders was always one of my favorite segments he ever did and I was hoping his HBO Max project would be in some way influenced by that. This is so exciting!!!
Thank God he's back. He was the absolute best late night host, I still laugh watching the segment where he went to the American Girl doll store and pretended one of the dolls was german lol
Hope he brings along jordan for a few adventures
YES.
I love the song he recorded in the first clip with the Norway kid. The vibe and sound totally encompasses Conan’s next chapter in his career! I’m so happy for him and excited for this show!
Noice, can’t wait to see it
Conan remotes was without script, i'm not sure this would be as hilarious
he aint funny anymore. retire old white man
Genius. After so many years of late night... this is exacly the best thing, that could happen. Endless "remotes" and hopefully jordan schlansky.
Time to pay HBO Max again, this is totally worth it
Kedekai!
Omg can’t waaaaait
This is the only reason why I'd get HBO... I cant wait for this!
I am ready... are you ready?  Is Conan ready?   LETS GET READY!!!
Can’t wait to see this on HBO! This is the only reason I’ll resume my subscription (well, this and friends 😅)
YESSSSSSS!!!!
Conan without borders? On HBO? FIRE ME!!!
Conan needs a talk show again
conan is genuinely so hilarious, his remote segments are legendary!!! im so happy hes doing more!!
CONAN REMOTESSSS LETS GOOOOO
Better than anything Jay Leno ever did.
A nice surprise.  I thought I read HBO had canceled his show. Cool.
Yessss! ❤😢 our prayers have been answered  🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why isn't Jordan Schlansky with him??? You guys missed a great opportunity 😂😂
Can't wait to watch!
Conan's just living his life
Love it! Can't wait 😅
Ma man is back with a bang-kok. Yayyyyyy
U r just a big fan of lix
Where's Jordan?
We've been waiting so long! I hope we get multiple seasons and would love to see Conan go back to Ireland and Texas again!
The most important question of all: will Jordan Schlansky appear in any chapter?  😂
We have been rewarded for our patience! Welcome back Conan! So hyped about this series. Thank you Max for doing this.
I love you Conan! I've been watching since 93!!!
This looks like "Somebody Feed Phil" but a million times better.
Where's Jordan?
OMG this is going to be awesome, cant wait!
this is genius!!!! well played!!!!
Give this to me now and believe me later.
That was Karl in Gudvagen!
Korea and Japan again 😬
Yes he must!  Love him so much ❤ So excited for this.   ♈🐦💜
Conan is the best, forever! Whatever he does is just gold. What a legend.
Finally
Conan is in his side quest era, and we are all for it!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Man..been waiting for this..
This will be the greatest thing Conan has ever made.
I fcking love Conan O'Brien.
would watch :)
YES!!!!!!!
I will get Max just for this
I hope we see Jordan.
No Jordan Schlansky? Pass.
Yessssssssssssssssssssss
Conan the Barbarian!
Where can we see it in Australia? (sans HBO Max out here)
We know we've all been waiting for this 😂
Mr. Late Night himself. Definitely renewing my HBO membership just to watch the GOAT himself
FINALLY
I'm ACTUALLY crying 😢. It's finally here... IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!
Conan is at his best traveling,  good job hbo
HBO's answer to Amazon's Grand Tour
I'm here for literally anything that Conan does
i enjoy all the remotes, but i find Conan in asian countries very cringy, because most of the western jokes don't translate well into asian languages and asian mindsets. Which was probably why the previous Japan episode was kind of weird. Even though there was the hamburger thingy which was funny.  i hope the thailand episode would turn out differently.
FINALLY!
Awesome, Conan's remotes were the best. Hope Jordan makes an appearance, or at least lurks menacingly
FINALLY ...THE CONAN, HAS COME BACK.....home 🤨
Conan is a legend
All these years of us saying Conan deserves the world and they actually gave it to him
This gave the widest smile I've had in months, can't wait!!!!!!   I love you Coco <3
This is what everyone wanted and been asking for years. Thank you!
i’m so excited 💟💟💟
i want to watch!!!
I hope they hire *Bill Burr" to do the commentary / questioning worth Conan!
Where is jordan
Where is Jordan Schlansky?
BRUH HOW AM I 3 DAYS LATE TO THIS OH MY LORD
YES!!!! Finally 😁
Conan CONSISTENTLY coming through for the fans… and his own ego 😂. Love this man! Can’t wait to see this.
This looks hilarious 😂
The Red Midnight Rider.
Finally I can stop watching reruns lol
Thank you for making this. Cannot wait
Conan <3 Best Talk Show Host ever?
I love you, Conan. I will give my money to HBO just to see you. I repeat, I will give money that I don't have to the HBO's CEOs and shareholders just in order to see you. I'm writing this even before watching the video. Long live Conan, the great.
HBO, in case you read this, I was waiting to sign up until Conan’s show was announced. So yes, keep doing shows with Conan - whatever he wants to do with you
I’ve ALWAYS loved Conan’s remotes. I’m so excited for this!!
Norway and Thailand. Where else?
Conan O'Brien is a global treasure.
I can't wait for this!!! I wonder if Conan will travel all the way here to my homeland of Sherman Oaks, CA. I would love to take him to our exotic markets like Ralphs Fresh Fare and our many restaurants specializing in our unique native cuisine (sushi).
We love Conan thank you 🙏 !!!!!
Man, I guess he really DOES need a friend. He needs it so bad he’ll travel all over the world to make it happen.😂
order season 2 now
0:28 so far this checks out
That background music was quite good and it had Conan's voice on it...Crazy! Please let this man into your country, don't be afraid, he doesn't mean any harm (usually).
I need this song so bad
I'm going to need way more than just 4 episodes of this.
I love that it was probably the job of an entire team of people at HBO that came up with the idea to change their app name to simply "Max". Truly inspired
Conan is the only one that is able to interview anonymous people
Too bad i cant watch this where I live :(
The stuff that we have been waiting for , is finally coming 🎉
I'm extremely offended by the lack of diversity I demand that they increase the shipments of refugees
OH MY GOSHHHHHH FINALLY
This is all I've ever wanted.
if jordan , andy and the comedy shorts gamer guy was in one scene, i m satisfied, but i love this too
For those on the fence - Don't blame Conan
PLEASE VISIT THE PHILIPPINES!!! Love, your pinoy fan. hahaha.
Only 4 episodes??? C’mon that’s too little! It has to have at least 10eps 🙏🏻
Finally! I always loved Conan in remote segments from his show. Now, we are going to see him in a full fledged travel show. That's amazing! Good job HBO! You listened to all of us.
This is going to be so fun.
I'm happy he is doing what he loves
Oh Yea!!!
Finally I am going to subscribe HBO max for this masterpiece !!! Conan is the best for this kinda content.
damn gotta get hbo max sub i guess
ohhh.. he really did go and make his promise to his podcast guests! can't wait for this..
Nice another way for Conan to ignore Brazil, unless it's an inappropriate joke
I will always remember 15 years ago on the Adam Carolla podcast Adam told the story of being in improv classes with Conan and Lisa Kudrow and Adam had an enormous crush on Lisa but she was bananas for Conan.
So basically, Conan Without Borders on STEROIDS.
best intro ever😂😂😂😂😂😂
love him from Thailand
When is this out?
Omg THIS is everything I wished for! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍😍😍
Jordan will join soon. He's just preparing his body in various ways.
Hey HBO MAX I need to watch this show in Japan. Hurry please, hurry.
This is the best trailer I have seen recently
guys, we did it.
looks fun. I'm exited.
This man was doing the bellows of PODcasts for a living!? thank GOD someone at HBO saw what we all see in this young talent. He's ready
this is awesome. can't wait to watch this the remotes were some of the most memorable episodes of conan on tbs.
This is great!!! I’m glad he’s back dude
Conan needs to pursue an acting career. I wish he played Genie in Alladin.
Just give him an Emmy!
Can't wait
Can we still share passwords here? If so, I’m calling for a Disney / MAX password swap
Hey....guess which talk show host has a job...and kiling it.....
So the network wanted an Anthony Bourdain type travel show so they went with the guy with a non-soothing nor cultured sounding voice with (seemingly) unmanaged ADHD  Perfect 🧐
This looks beyond amazing I’m so glad Conan is back!
❤
i love this shows name
LETS GOOO
finally
oh my freaking glob. it hasn't been released yet but i already need more 😭
I was hoping that the podcasts were going to lead to on location episodes. I think Conan is at his best out in public - they we’re definitely always my favorite parts of his late night shows.
No release date????
The writers/producers are incredible. One the podcast --- every time Conan would say something along the lines of "well we will let you know if we are ever in the area" it always made me think...I hope he eventually goes to visit them. They (talented writers/producers) knew we loved the remotes and giving the fans what we want. Genius work.
Conan returns!!
This is like Conan Without Borders Specials from CONAN love it! #TeamCoco
Conan is always hilarious.
They finally did it a series that is just conan travelling to different places, OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED!
Can’t wait for this!!!
I will watch this.
where's jordan schlansky????
Bro is this a remote but produced by HBO? This is gonna be amazing!
This man's a national treasure
I can’t wait to see this!!! ❤❤❤
why is the the new max logo blue. disney and paramount pluses are already blue,. It was the only purple one
Can´t wait to watch this whole show in a day
Now we know why Conan is missing from late night TV
Can't Wait!
Remote segments were the best. Hopefully Jordan comes along for the ride, too.
I didn’t see Jordan. How can this possibly be good without him?
Can we get Jordan Schlansky there as well?
Finally have a reason to subscribe to Max
The key to world peace is Conan O'Brien.
Finally!!!
Now I have reason to live on this planet. Can’t wait to see it. When is the release date?
I will get HBO just for this
oh my god they did it
When does this start?!
conan must go, further
Conan is the only celeb I ever binge watch. You are sooo funny
Yaaaay
theres gotta be an episode of him in his supa suit
Rick Steves WISHES he could be on this level
Steven Yeun needs to tag along on all these trips!
From Chile 🇨🇱 , i was waiting for this. Love you Conan!.
this looks like it could be a lot of fun or very bland, like if this were anyone else i would say it looks like gentrified parts unknown with anthony bourdain, but i love conan so i know itll be fun
oh mama its a nice surprise
About time. Unfortunately on HBO max so not sure how I will see it.
Conan can talk and interact with anyone.
But will Sona be there? Asking for a friend who has a huge crush on her.
Agreed. But, he keeps coming back ! ! What can we do?
It's incredible how much joy this man brings people. He will forever be the goat.
Oh. My. God.
Oh man, so now I gotta sub to HBO!! Does anybody want to share their password with me? 🥺
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ ohhhhh mannnn
so its just thailand and norway lol
COMING SOON WHEN?!?!?!
No joke, Thai food is insanely spicy. There's no spicy dishes of course, but when spicy it's like eating fire.  Conan is probably having a fever dream after that bite.
I keep coming back to listen to the song
Coco Returns❤
I’m A big fan I love in Canada , why you don’t come here visit me 😢 Epic video 😅Conan the Barbarian lol
Is Jordan going to be there?
I have been saying this for a while conan without borders was one of the best thing conan ever did love to see him in Pakistan
Seems like every streaming service have their own celebrity travels around the world series
Lebanon here , i wish i could meet conan you know before he... i mean one of us dies odds are... nvm i love the old red haired bastardo
So good to see Conan! Can't wait to watch this!
Cant wait
Can't wait ❤
I really wish Jordan has a few scenes in this lol.
YAAYYYYYYYYYYY🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tears of joy rn. I can die happy. 🥰
Conan if u can pay a visit in China that's will be great
YAAAAs Coco, YAAAASSSSSSSS!! 😍
This looks SUPER RAD!!!
conan is probably one of the most likable talk show host.
Conan = never funny....
where's jordan
"Coming soon", "in production", no date.
It's happening!!
The only thing missing about this is a release date!
My body needs more Conan
Jordan Schlansky must go WITH!
Can't wait for this!
what is that song?
OH MY GERD
It is the best parts of the Conan O'Brien show! This looks fantastic! Congratulations to Conan after late night!
OMFG!!!!! Can't wait!!!!! Love you TeamCoCo!!!!!!
I love his wonderment and pure joy of trying to entertain, it comes through.
About time❤
This is what Conan was always meant to do.  😎
Please tell me Jordan Schlansky will be there too.
At last he is back doing remotes. Which were always my favorite when Conan did it. I actually can’t wait to see what this show does.
It seems like he is going out, having fun, and making a career out of it.  Well done sir!  Best of luck to you and all your future endeavors!
Thank you. I hope no more Sona, I love that girl but she isnt a comedian and always ends up ruining Conan's comedic flow.
Conan remotes were always the highlight of his show(s). Finally, an entire show dedicated to just that.
It just needs Schlansky!!!
I UNLIKED THIS JUST SO I COULD LIKE IT AGAAIIIINNN
I'm so ready for this!
OHHHMMYYYYYGGOOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!
Had the dumbest smile the whole time watching this, god im so excited i hope he continues with these style adventures
That helm is deff 6+ to all stats
Awesome, I read he was doing travel shows for hbo max WAAAY back but never knew if they were ever coming or not, I listen to every podcast so this should be incredible to see the fans he talked to.  The travel shows were always a huge highlight during the TBS shows, can't wait!
God I miss him so much! 🥺Every time I had a hard day at school or work, coming back home late at night and seeing him live always gave me a smile and a few laughs. And honestly killed me when I first heard that his show was being canceled. I'm glad to see that she's still got it!🤣🤣
😅
The greatest of all time
HBO, I want you to know that when Conan has not come on board yet, I had canceled my subscription. Today, I added it back for one reason. CONAN.
THANK THE DEITIES
Conan fans rejoice!
FINALLY
Next level excited !!!
Omg LETS GOOOOOO
i'm gonna watch but jfc the music in this promo is painfully generic.
im going. To kms
Conan’s remotes were always top tier television, and now they are the basis for an entire show. Awesome.
Yes.
Conan travel show lets go
I love this. I'm just sad that Conan was here and I didn't get to meet him.
finally
Conan has mastered the art of cultural exchange.  He more than deserves this!!!!!
😢I would get HBO MAX just to see Conan. I miss him so much in late night. Everyone else sucks so much.
Love you Conan O'Brien. Love you #TeamCoco. So so happy that you are doing this. 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY! THIS IS GONNA GET ME TO RESUB TO MAX.   I plan to cancel after Barry and then resign. I only watch House of the Dragon, Last of Us, and Hacks, all of which won't air this year. Hacks would have but the strike killed that chance.
I'm sad these will be a Max only thing. I hope they are later posted on YouTube or in some other location for others to watch. I'm also sad it's only 4 episodes and sincerely hope they expand on that!!
Looking forward to this
He’s pining for the fjords
That song is lit.🔥🔥🔥
I love this song please release this song in a single I am not joking I really really love the energy of it
CAN'T WAIT!
When the world needed him the most he returns😭out of all late night show host he's my favorite
Yes. 😊
Yall seriously calling yourselves "Max" now huh 😂😂😂😂
YES!!! Conan in his natural element, doing remotes, nothing beats that!
YEEEEEEEEEES!
Conan the Comedian!
finally
These Conan adventures around the world are soo much fun to watch, while standing out he fits in everywhere and makes alot of peoples day
Jordan must go as well.
Oh boy he is to comedy what Led Zeppelin is to Rock
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! 😂
conan the barbarian
I hope Jordan is in the Thailand episode.
Okay yeah, I'd watch this
Its gonna be so epic
I love that song he’s singing in 😂😂
LET'S GO!!!
YES🧡🧡🧡
Come to India please
Come to India
Jordan must go with Conan!
Conan is unstable.AND I LOVE IT.
Only Late Night Host who always try to stay in the Spotlight.Even after he was done hosting again and again.
I wish Andy was going with him. Andy is always hilarious in the studio and out of it.
I am looking forward to this!
Bring Sona with you, Conan!
Viking helmets didn't have horns.
I’ve been waiting a loooooong time for this and I am super excited.
Just tell me when.
Omg it's that dude who says he will use conan as a ladder LOL HAHAHA
Seriously? Can’t this guy just find something else to do? He’s irrelevant.
I can't wait for this  I'm so excited.
Yes! 🎉
I could not be more excited for this
Conan's the new Braveheart.
I knew Conan had a lot of Norwegian 1500's in 'im.
I'm hoping the world's leading non-expert on games will also be returning to his main job.
Yey!!!! Love Conan!!! Can't wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Conan with norm McDonald are by far the most legendary clips and Ihats what I think cemented Conan in history
at long last
This may be one of the only good reasons, if not the best reason, to have HBO Max.
Yikes. John Oliver was right about HBO Max.
brilliant idea in so many ways!
So excited for this!!
Wherever Conan goes, I will follow
What’s the song name?
I'm so excited for this.
This with succession? Time to get a subscription
Can’t wait for the Bangkok episode. I bumped into him in Bangkok Chinatown on April 23 this year.
I want to hug conan once in my lifetime
I wanna watch it!
Yes. I didn't think we'd be blessed with such greatness ever again.
This was one of my favorite segments on Conan
This is amazing
This is going to be amazing!
Nooo he needs a company for every episode, like what he did back on his 'Remotes' with Steven Yeun, Jordan Schlansky, Kevin Hart and Ice Cube.  That would make it more fun haha
0:10 so this is that "Vinland Saga" I've heard so much about
The only reason I’ll be getting HBO again
this looks amazing !!!
Yes!.must go away ginger bread man
This is gonna be epic🤩🤩
Can you take Fallon, Colbert and Meyers with you wherever you are going please? And stay there forever....
Why on earth did you drop HBO? Whomever made the decision to go with "max" instead of HBO is an idiot.
I would have loved Jordan to be part of this too.
Did Conan just pull off the ultimate?  Paid to travel the world solely for entertainment.
Ok fine, Ill finally get HBO MAX
The first couple of seconds I was like " Wow! conan in his true form...a viking" 😂😂. Can't wait to watch this, CONAN!!!
Can't wait
Should be fun, but this trailer's weak. No laughs, a rushed edit, music that doesn't fit, the title just thrown out--
Conan was and will always be my favorite late night host.
Conan??  Why are you YELLING when you're speaking???  They're NOT DEAF,  they just don't understand English.  STOP YELLING!! 😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
Damn, welp my Hiatus from HBO Max is coming to an end I guess.
About time. We’ve been waiting like 5 years for this already.
This is the first time I've considered getting hbo max
Conan out there post-late night living his best life. Good for him.
FINALLY!!!🤩
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
YESSSSSS THIS IS WHAT THE FANS WANTED, REMOTE SEGMENTS 😂
I predict late night tv shows will return in 5 years on cable/hbo/NETFLIX etc etc. Or maybe they alread have?
Farewell Conan O'Brien. Glad you are finally retiring. We love your show and miss you well.
Safe travels Conan! Can't wait to watch these :)
Petition for season 2: Jordan Schlansky Must go
Boy was I wrong to think Conan was just lying whenever he would say he will visit CONAF guests
Maybe it’s how this trailer is cut but this wasn’t doing it for me.  Also seems like he’s forcing it.  Hope I’m wrong.
when does it come out?
I’m so here for this.
Cool!
Stop promoting scamming countries like Philippines and Thailand.  Their people are full of deceitful people.
I love conan
He said he was doing a show for a streaming service, i cant wait!
Oh, cool, it's gonna be on Max Weinberg's streaming service.
Each episode better be at least 3 hours long
a truly magnificent idiot and i love him beyond compare ...i would die for conan if it meant he kept entertaining everyone else
if youre following conans podcast, the places and the people he went to are his guests on his podcast that invited him to their home countries. more or less.
The improv master gets to use the world as his palette
But when?! When?!!!!
WHAT'S THE SOOONG? RELEASE IT!!!
I hope Andy Richter is still part of this.
Coco Is Back I can't wait for this series
EPIC!
im really excited with this!! especially fan of the podcast! hopefully we have more XD
Conan! When will you visit Indonesia? 🇮🇩
So looking forward to this!
Did he visit Philippines? Goodness gracious please come here! 📣📣📣📣
This show was announced years ago it’s about time!!
Conan living his best life
I missed him
I’m so jealous of his podcast guests 😭😭😭🤯🤯
I'm in...
miss Conan! can't wait!
this is going to be gold!
Really hope Jordan shows up  in one of these.
Conan: I'm retiring, I'll just idly keep my podcast going and that's it Also Conan: SIKE! Here's me going on a worldwide tour in a contract with a major network
yes yes yes
you just made my day conan. can't wait to binge watch all episodes
The comeback kid. Love how he keeps innovating and forcing himself into our lives and onto our screens.
Is he really gaining weight?
#RestoreTheConanverse!
Honestly everytime i am like "jeez Conan cannot get any cooler than thattt" this segment is going be GOLDDD
This makes me so happy! 😊
Conan finishes 30 years of late night and has time to see his family   His family after a couple years: Yeah maybe you can go do a travel show...
CONAN O'BRIEN THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!!
nice song
Glorious!
I am counting down the seconds to see this show.
Please, HBO Max, make it available to watch everywhere, not only in the US!!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻 Conan travels and has fans around the globe, we all want to see his show!
Yesssssss conan traveling
Finally!
This will be the greatest! Might be wishful thinking but I hope Sona and Matt make an appearance too.
Getting HBO max just for this! Conan is the best!! 😂
Oh god this is going to be brilliant.
I'm so excited for this to happen. Conan O'brien will forever be the Goat of talk show hosts
This feels so epic! From the song to the settings to the meetings of the actual fans that have been on the podcast! Cant wait !
Finally
Yesssss!!! I'm so looking forward to this! HBO is da bomb! I will keep my HBO subscription till the day I die lol
If I could trade oxygen for Conan, I would...but I knda need it so I can stay alive.
I don't have (and never had) HBO Max. When the TBS show ended, I told everyone that when Conan's show starts on Max, that'll be when I sign up for Max. So very happy to see this. The day it drops is the day I sign up!
Ohhh nooooo!  Anthony don't leav............I mean, Conan!  Don't do it! Don't leave us!!  You can get help! Just reach out!
Conan's been so quiet about this project that I half-believed it wasn't ever going to happen - I am SO GLAD I can put that worry to rest!! HECK YEAH!
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!!! AND I WANT THAT SONG TO BE RELEASED ASAP!!
I’m all over this!! Yes!
I feel like I have been waiting for this my whole life
freaking love Conan. Just love him.
CONESIEEEEEE!! I guess I'm signing up for HBO max!
This is a Late Night with Conan O'Brien remote on steroids.
I'm excited
Can't wait for this!
Love how he follows up with the fans from the podcast
This is almost too good to be true.
Introduced my 14 year old son to Conan 2 years ago and he loves him. Well def be watching this together!
Gonan
If anyone’s gotta go, it’s Jordan
gonna sub HBO just to watch this guy. he's worth it!!
YOOOO LEZZZGGOOO!!! 😆😆😆😆 The Late Night Legend!! Has a show off of the people he called on his podcasts 😆😆😆 this man is a Genius when it comes to content
yay!! Can't wait!!!
Oh hey he did the thing that everybody who called in recommended. Good on ya.
what do you mean soon...I need it NOW!!!
Words can't describe how unbelievably excited I am to see him embarrass himself in my country, Norway.
Had a smile on my face the entire time watching this. Can't wait till this is available.
About damn time
Can’t wait for this
i think he's getting old... but what do you care huh? tough guy?...   sorry i just miss dave letterman... and i don't want conan to be old like dave... but man... it does feel better!  hope dave lives a little longer... and you too conan
AT LAST HE RETURNS
Conan is unstoppable. He was the (only) funniest and most genuine late night TV show host and to this day still remains the funniest and most genuine host even after retiring late night hostings.
Jordan??
Can't wait!!!
Thank god!
Gooood, I want this so much
When we needed him most, he returned <3 🐱
This is everything I wanted and needed at exactly the right time I wanted and needed it! Thank you!
How to subscribe to MAX outside of the U.S.?
Yes!
Bring Jordan Schlansky with you!
So excited!
Looks really good but HBO max isn’t that good at editing trailers. I prefer team coco
Thank God. More of Coney traveling! 🫶
Yes.   Yes!!    And more YESSSS !!!!!!!
YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
Pretty ballsy to name the show after a Jay Leno quote.
Conan was the King of late night, no rehotoric or politics just comedy.
I hope we can see Jordan in one of these episodes!
Imagine if Karl Pilkington joins him. That would break the internet.
It's about damn time.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
He always said he would love to visit them, and he really meant it!
Can't wait
Huh, that's what Conan's last network NBC said.
2008 me would of loved this
But when?? WHEN DOES IT RELEASE????
I missed you Conan O'Brien. Thanks for doing this
Conan being fired turned out to be the greatest thing to happen to the small screen
I have regained the will to live.
Yes, a Conan travel show is exactly what the world needs. Awesome news.
Now this is something to keep me subscribed to Max
i am getting chills
I knew Conan couldn't stay out of the spotlight for long. He breaks out on extreme rashes all over his body if he doesn't meet his daily laugh quota.
*This looks awesome!*
for 47 years HBO has received exactly zero of my dollars... UNTIL NOW!
FINALLY. We've been waiting for Conan's HBO Max show to be announced...
Sweet Enola Gay ITS HAPPENING!!!!
Wow so great to finally see you back in your natural elements once again! Looking forward to more remote segments!
Welcome back Conan 🙂
Coney come out to playyay
Conan is one of my favorite people ever. Think of all the so-called "important" people out there, who make me feel nothing. But it will be a truly sad day and significant loss for the world when he passes.
Conan is easy to like.
This is what Conan should have done since the start
We all knew this was coming 😂
Can’t wait!
YEEEEESSSSS
What is the name of the song used?
Beautiful.
JHC just give us a date.. 🙄
The return of the king.
So excited for this!!! Finally!!!
Looks like fun! I can’t wait to watch!
TV DREAM COME TRUE - CONAN TRAVEL SHOW!!!
Conan trading his desk for slippers and sunglasses. Let's gooo
Wow, on "Conan O'Brien Needs a Fan" when he says one day he'll visit the fan...he's actually serious! Conan is a legend. A role model celebrity who actually doesn't act like one.
so excited for this
KEDAKAI AS GOD MADE HER!!!!
Seeing how much more entertaining than all the current late night hosts combined still makes me mad how NBC treated him.
this is perfect
This gonna be good 😍
Thought that was David Letterman, at first, in that opening scene.
This is what will make me sub to HBO 😂
Pls come to Indonesia
Jordon better be in this.
Please have Jordan Schlansky appear in his various ways
I am so happy to see him on screen again. love you conan.
Conan living his best life
Ty conan for doing this project. HBO give him more projects.
YES
Only four episodes? 😔 it’s not enough but happy to get what I can Conan is the best!
Conan sang his own theme song
This looks so good. I'm so happy for consies
can't wait! 😍😍
He sux big time!!
ded!!! omg i can't believe it took this long for just a remote's show1111111
Her at 281,559 views.
Been payiently waiting for this. Havent listened to too much of his podcast lately just because i haven't been a big fan of somr of his recent guests
What a legend!
God I hope Jordan makes an appearance in a few of these sharing his knowledge
For all of you who saw his bit with the Japanese teachers, you know this is going to be comedy gold.
The greatest late night show host ever is BACK
would have been better if steven yuen was in it too
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
His travel segments were always prime late night so a Conan travel show is gonna be lit
Yes,  exactly what I wanted,  exactly what I need. More of this.
I've been waiting so long for this. I cannot wait!!
Guys, i need the song stat! Song bops hard! ❤❤❤
Conan had the best remotes, especially the travel ones
This s going to be heavily entertaining! What an idea for a show!!! Perfect! I can't wait!
Conan Bourdain's No Reservations Season 1 looks tight
YAY
yes dude
Yes! Can't wait!!!
Yes.
🎉 Congratulations Conan! Hurray for Conan. So proud.😢
Love the last time Conan traveled series this looks just as good :)
I’m shocked at how short the Norwegian guy is. And Anna and her mom are just as I pictured.
wooooohoooooooooo 🎉
Gonna watch this for sure lol.
You guys see the description?? It’s a four-episode series.  Omfg 😮 what other countries has he visited?? I only heard of these two shown in the trailer….
Conan Without Border is my favorite part of his show. this will be fun for all of us fans
Finally!!!
Yes!
THANK YOU! CONAN, WE MISSED YOU!
Conan O'Brien Must Go WITH Jordan Schlansky!
Omg yes! Ok, all I gotta do now is stay alive until this aires!
Oh my god! Yessss!!! We’ve been waiting for this for the longest time, Conan. True legend ❤ Imma subscribe for HBO Max just to see Conan.
love the play on the title of the documentary about him, 'Conan Can't Stop'.
His travel shows are always great
finally... thought this would never came
OH MY GOD MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE
This must be why most of the "Conan Needs a Fan" podcasts have fans from outside the US.
We need Jordan to join him on at least 1 trip tho
It's missing Andy or Jordan
Wait, does this mean that if I call, there is a chance that Conan might visit? 😅
=- T
Lfgggggggg
4 episodes? Weak.
This is amazing omg!
Conan the Late Night Barbarian!  Much love from Cincinnati!!
Can't wait!!!
This should've been made YEARS ago. Well, better late then never.
I miss late night already bro it's the best talk show ever and they killed it
I hope it'll be available in Brazil
I got rid of HBO years ago, well, looks like I better get it back now. DAMN YOU CONAN!
I got HBO just for Barry, but I'm keeping my subscription for Conan...
Never stop making these.
No writers? 🥺
Oh wow, this looks so good and fun!
100% will watch if Sona and Matt come along
This is amazing 😂, I just needed to subscribe to HBO
Can’t wait!
Finally! What a great idea to visit his fans from the podcast. I might have to get hbo
We are so excited for this!!  I love you Conan! Your segments are hilarious. The king has returned! ❤
I’ve been waiting for this. I’m so excited!
This is going to be great
I cannot WAIT for this. Conan is the BEST.
The trial-seperation isnt going as planned I c. Wondering if his kids atleast got the Irish goodbye,
As soon as this goes live on MAX I will be subscribing again!
All Hail Coco!
…as long as Jordan goes with him.
Here for it! Yay!
Jordan ... Jordan .... Jordan .... 🤞
I really hope Sona is in this too
YEEEEEESSSSSSSS
i've missed consie o b-rye in my eyeballs
finally!!!!
BRING JORDAN SCHLANSKY ALONG FOR VARIOUS THAILAND TASKS!
so this is why he was in thailand dunking on matt!
I like that the title is an obvious play on his documentary feature, "Conan Can't Stop." Nice.
Happy to see Conan Happy! This gonna be GREAT!!!
I love him, he always have something to say
I'm so happy!!!
YES! 🙌  Been waiting so long for his return! Pumped for this! 👏
Looks decidedly unscripted.
LET'SSS GOOOO
Welcome back Conan in his new show Must go traveling around the world is lots of fun.
This is actually the same title for a show that Jay Leno spearheaded a few years back…
Conan is so dedicated for growing that beard just for this show, pretty impressive
I love it! Long live Conan!
Conan's going to BillBoard top with this massive hit song
All hail Conan the Red 😂😂
Jay Leno is going to steal this show too.
Conan Remotes brought me through a lot of bad times when I was a teenager. I'm so god damn happy this is happening 😅🎉😊
“Trust the Gorton’s fisherman”
so glad this will be on hbo, now i know itll be good. if this was on netflix it would not be good
Okay, now I will sign up for HBO Max. I think this show is going to be wonderful. Might actually be a uniteful message. The world needs that more than ever right now.
Conan isn’t a talk show host. He’s a World Show Host
I want this man to live forever please
YESSSSSS!!!! Looks great. Only wish is that he returns to Italy with Jordan for a second trip.
Did you see Karl Pilkington in the background? No? Me neither. 😞
I can already tell my cheeks will be hurting when I watch this.🤣
Looks like Conan prepared his HBO show in various ways
Conan is a national treasure
Really wish he would visit Sweden. He was so close!
Dude where do I get this song?!
Ill sub to hbo max just to watch this
fuq yeass LOVE YOU CONEZYYYYY
Conan should go to amsterdam and do truffles
So stoked for this! Thanks HBO for bringing back the Conan remotes
Wish This is so much yes!!! I wish you'd have made it to Taiwan as well!!!! Been a fan since I've been ~12 years old. Grew up in the States and continued watching nearly every episode of your show even over here for the last ~10 years and the Podcast.
this doesn't have the same feel as Conan Without Borders...It seems over produced and very lonely. Like they have plonked Conan in front of a camera and given him strict script. I'm really hoping that's not the case and we still get the same Conan we all love.
Finally
Finally
I hate reality tv. I love Conan. This is basically Conan on reality tv. I hate that I need to watch this. This better not awaken anything in me...
Will watch anything with Conan.
Season 2: Jordan Must Go
Conan O'Brien "Can't Stop", he "Must Go" 😉
Fabulous idea. Anyone know the name of the background song or music please?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yessssss!!!!
This is gonna be fun, can't wait XD
OMG! This is gonna be the best!!🎉 I’m so excited for this!!😊😊
best tv host ever. love you coco!
From a marketing perspective, not doing a Conan travel show would be the biggest blunder of all time. Can't wait
Go cooco go😅
The real question is whether there will be a scene in every episode where Conan tells Jordan Schlansky that he has a new show and that he is not in it.
Yes the return of the king , i really miss his talk show he was the only talk show host who can make me genuinely laugh
Oh Captain, my Captain.
Let's goooo!!!❤😂😂❤
Jordan Schlansky wasn't informed about this show so that they wouldn't have to pay for his Italian vacations
Where is Andy??
Jordan finally has a job again
THE SOUND I MADE WHEN I SAW THIS ON MY COMPUTER SCREEN
I literally got max just because I heard Conan is doing a show on here!!! I can’t wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Conan is my comedian hero ❤
Nobody can do what Conan does. So stoked for this. Hopefully Sona was able to be in a few episodes. Their dynamic is top notch.
I am so so excited for this!!!
Will he finally find Faggerstrom??
Should go to Haiti, heard it's nice.
Holy crap, he actually went to visit some of his podcast guests. Let's the podcast listeners appreciate the show even more
He returns! Long have I waited.
VERY FRESH VERY ORIGINAL COMEDY AT IT'S BEST
Thank God !!
OMG OMG OMG OMG IT'S HAPPENING!!!!
sooo cute, can he be our next Anthony Bourdain
Go Conan
Long live the king
The true successor to Parts Unknown is HERE
The GOAT is BACK!
Vroom vroom party starter! (IYKYK)
FINALLY!
Yess! ❤
The world needed this.
Love Conan. Love HBO. Who tf is Max?
When?
Fine, I'll keep my HBO subscription 🙄😂
Ooo I hope he visits Singapore Sona 🤣
Holy shitake mushroom !!!!
Found my new ringtone
On the next episode of Ice Nipples.
Conan desperately trying to hang onto fame. sad
HBO Max, now you will get my money! That is, when the show premieres!
OMG!!! FINALLY!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳🙏🙏🙏🙏 I'm soooo so sooooooo happy!!!! 😊 ☺
All I've ever wanted in life is a Conan travel show.  The time is now.
Yeeeeeeees
What about the podcast?
Conan is a treasure.
0:20 ngl that's probably what conan's ancestors looked like and no one ever found out that they looked like vanilla skeletons under the layers
I can only hope that he starts this trip by going to Gourley's favorite snack shop and then buying up all Gourley's snack treats, and then giving them to people overseas who aren't Matt to enjoy.
Their are no words that describe the level of excitement I'm feeling for this. Just thank you for bringing him back. I'm renewing my subscription today
Finally, he has returned
There was talk of gerbils!
Can't wait. This is what he is meant to do
Conan O'Brien must never go! You must live forever.
Finally we hear something about what he's been working on! So glad he's incorporating the podcast into the show. Just looks like such a fun watch. A whole bunch of new Conan remotes on the way. Can't wait.
Excellent use of his brilliance
nope.... not feeling it.... not the same without andy, jordan and the sketches
I can’t wait!!!!! 🎉❤
I wanna be next! Lolol
YES!
THANK YOU GOD AND CONAN
and yet I take the time to travel to Conan's house on his day off & all I get is mace & an arrest record (understand a joke when you read one)
cant wait!!!!!
I'm so happy lets go Conan
Conan Conan Conan Conan
I will miss the laugh track
omg the podcast guests he asked jokingly if he could visit, he actually visited?!?
Finally!! 😊
Dang.  Now I have to get HBO Max
PLAY THE TRUMPETS FOR THE KING IS BACK! 🎉
I'm so happy :)
Finally!!
Cant wait..
This is perfect, and is gonna be awesome. I will literally subscribe to this service just to watch this show.
I thought the day would never come! Looks like it's missing some of the 'low-budget' charm of the talkshow, a bit too polished in a sense. Hope I'm wrong and that Conan brought Jordan to some of these places!
I've never signed up for HBO Max for any show. But HBO has found my only weakness for subscribing to anything, Conan O'Brien....
YES
of all the realities in the multiverse for what the new Conan show could be, this is the best possible outcome. HYPED!
I have got to get that song, 😆
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
dude i want a release date lol
I am Sooooo EXCITED for this !!!!!!!!
Conan's remote segments were always my favorite content from his night shows, and they got even better when he dedicated entire TBS episodes of him just travelling to different countries and exploring the cultures. Im SO excited to see more of this.
Great show, too bad the new channel branding sucks ... to the max
This is going to be an massive hit
OMG this is genius; always loved his travel bits, of course a travel show with Conan - how did I not know I needed this?!?!
I watched this video ONCE and already got the Salmon in the Sea song stuck in my subconscious 🥴
Kumain na ba kayo?
A sequel to "An Idiot Abroad" LMAO!
Yassss!!! So excited to see Conan's travel series again!! Woot woot
Chill Chums, rejoice!
This cant be overly produced, it needs to be as authentic feeling as his travel segments imo
Didn't think Conan could get any paler but here we are.
Conan remotes were always the BEST. Excited for this.
After Carson, Conan is the best late night host there’s been.  I’ll die on that hill!
They should bring in Jordan and Matt for this show as well, it will complete everything!!!
This should be wildly entertaining 😂
Omg!!!!!  This is amazing, I can’t wait to see these follow ups of being so goofy!
yes please!
Return of the King
Conan has such a beautiful voice. What an artist.
Its finally here! The return of the king!
Ive been waiting so long for this.
This is the best syttende mai present ever! Thank you Conan for coming to Norway!
King of Late Night RIGHT THERE #fuJayLeno
Omg, this seems hilarious!!! The song feels like could've come out of a BeeGees catalogue.........meaning it's gonna be a hit!
YESSSSSSS!!!!
We all know that if there won't be Jordan Schlansky - we will RIOT
I lost the bet.  Conan's show will debut before George RR Martin's next book.
So, my guess is now that it is no longer named "Conan without borders" this means there may be some travels within the states as well??
He needs to do travel show permenantly.
I was wondering how Conan feels about starting off as a replacement to being unreplaceable?
Soon?!! When soon?!! I need a date!!! I can’t believe this is happening. I watch old Conan vids every week to fill the void in my soul
Finally! My life has purpose again!
Hey where is Jordan?
Conando!!!
yessss
Amy release date yet?
He is way too fun
Arguably one of the GOAT of late night. Glad to see him still doing his thing. Can't wait!
Somehow Conan fits perfectly with this outfit. He shoulda wore this in his shows.
I’m crying. I’ve been waiting so long for his return! His podcast is incredible but there’s nothing like seeing him on screen! 😭
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Conan should come to india. Conan and chaos goes well
I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!
im sooo happy to see him in this travel format again 🥹
Whoever dropped HBO from the name to make it “Max” should be fired.
I’ve waited 1.5 years, and in an extension 10 years, for a program where all Conan does is remotes
Best news ever
I'll watch anything that involves Conan suffering.
Excellent news, more from the best.
Im dead ❤❤❤❤❤
Any chance you'll be adding Chinese subtitles to your content someday? I can't watch anything of yours with my g/f without them, so I'm on the verge of cancelling.
Finally! I love his podcast & have been looking forward to his new work!
Conan the GOAT! We’re getting a show full of remotes 🙌🏿
I can tell you exactly how this show was conceived.     Conan's Wife:  "Look, I get it.   But, you have to get out of the house and find something to do.  You're driving me crazy."
Bergen, Norway is so gorgeous. I wish I had spent more time there.
give this man a new talk show.. please!
I couldn’t be more excited for this.
Funny thing is that he goes to visit you whether you want him to or not lol
Is it these two countries or do we wait for the next trailer?
I’m so excited for this. Conan is the best.
Conan is the best late night host of all of them, seriously so much better than all the current ones today. When does this series come out?? will have to re-sign up for it
Conan!!!!!
I am unbelievably happy about this.
Conan is the goat.
Can't wait
Yey!!! I thought it would never come
I could always use more conan in my life
The legend is back
The legend is back 😭😍
Ok but where's Sonya
Yesss!
No other person can truly hold the title of International Comedian than Conan
Awwww yeeeahhh Conan on the street 🎉
I remember years ago when Conan was still doing his late-night show, he was asked if there was anything he disliked about the job and he said that the one thing he disliked is his schedule made it very difficult to travel and see the world because he had to be in the studio and film the show every night. So it's nice seeing Conan doing all this travelling, since it's something he's always dreamed of doing.
Señor O’brien, usted es el 👑!!
OH MY GAAAAA!! I cannot wait!! It's gonna be hilarious! Conan is just the bestish human being eva! 😅😅😂
waiting for Thailand.. x
This could've been the best show ever if Jordan was on it as well
Awesome. I’m very much looking forward to watching this!
Conan entering the travelogue/presenter phase of his career and I’m here for it 😊😂
you rich people and your pay per view......just gotta brag to the peons that your in the private club..PFT!
The man, the myth, the legend… Conan O’Brien
The lack of Jordan Schlansky is a bummer
I already tell im going to love this show
The spiritual successor to Conan Without Borders, which I loved. Cannot wait. Hope to see more like this in the future.
IT's going to be good. i just hope he make's Jordon almost cry again. 🤞
I thought he was interviewing me to be nice. He was just looking to take over my quaint Norwegian town. Now I have Earl Cönan demanding offerings of my grandmother’s pickled fish. She’s so old and her hands are so tired, but he just keeps screaming “MORE FISH”. If someone could please help, we are very cold and very scared
SOOOO excited for this!!
Yeah, but is Schlansky going too?
The King of Late Night, the King of Podcasts, the King of Remotes, now is the King of Travel. I kneel before you Conan, the King of Comedy Entertainment
wait... only four episodes? well i hope its a good one, and there will be more of it
Yeeeeeeees!
The best late night host has returned! Conan is always entertaining, so I’m pumped for this.
OHMYLORDYIMSOEXCITED!!!!! 😍💥🤩
Oh, he really did get an HBO show.
What?!? The same kind of humor and wit and fun that we’ve come to love about Conan but in a travel show?!? This is genius!! I’m super excited for this.
Conan never ceases to amaze me 🤩
This is going to be great...
Love it
I cannot wait for this OH MY GODDDDDDD!!!!!!!
This is EXACTLY the show I wanted Conan to do.
I never thought this day would come 🥺. I gave up on expecting this show and just assumed he was just going stick to podcasting don’t get me wrong I love his podcast but I’m so glad this show is finally happening. The legend is back!! 😁😁😁😃
JORDAN SCHLANSKY HAS TO JOIN HIM ❤🙏🏻🤞🏻
THIS is amazingggggggg .  It's like Conan without borders.  Best news everrrr <3
Conan doing more travelling? I'm here for it! As long as the podcast continues!
Just when I was thinking of cancelling my subscription!
I hope Jordan makes an appearance
This would be even more awesome if Jordan Schlansky would do this with him.
I’m all in I love this whole thing
YESSS
Finally!! 🎉❤
We’re all expecting Jordan and Sona to tag along!!!
Now this is something worth watching! Cannot wait love Conan 💯💯💯
Love it! But where's Sona?!
I had a huge smile during this entire video. This is the greatest day of my life.
I am so down for this. Im so glad you are back on screen!
*ahem*   YYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS
The legend returns.
As a 90s kid growing up watching Conan, I can't say enough but yes....yes yes yes!
Conan is back baby!!!! I really hope Jordan Schlansky is in some of the episodes
Why is that song really good though lmao
IN MY VEEEEEEEINS , PUT IR IN MY VEINSSSSSSSSS
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING
It makes me so happy but sooo sad at the same time to know that Conan was so close to where I live 😂😂😂
congrats hbo, u found a way to get my credit card info
This man really refuses to stop huh
The king of late night
Oh this looks good
The man must RIFF!! The comedy flows thorough his veins as he sees new faces to ridicule!
COCO GANG
This is worth watching
😂😂💯🔝
Legend
Been waiting for this !
THIS. This is Conan show we wanted.
This is what I have been missing in my life! This show is going to be amazing!   How fun his life must be :)
Greatest news all year.
You are enablers because Conan is my addiction.
Oh yessss…my anxiety issues will now be cured😍😂
hbo just doesn't miss! this is brilliant!
Yes!!
Yeesssss
Thats it HBO! Take my money! Finally subscribing for Conan! This looks AMAZING!
YAAAAASSSSS. Finally.
Yes... YESSSSSSS YAAAAASSSSSSSSS🎉❤🎉😂🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉😂🎉❤
HBO could also make a series just as successful with Bill Burr walking around a city, and it'd probably cost far less.
give it to me now
Cant wait to see conan going to startrek place that was mentioned in podcast
No Jordan Schlansky?  Pass
Gonan.
Lol.. never not funny... Conan is a champ
He's cool, of course, but because of the stupid feud between him and Leno, people were put in position of having to choose, which is awful - its constantly implied that you can't be a fan of both of them. And so because that's the case, I got to choose Leno. I'm sorry, no one can deny he's 100 times funnier and a greater talk show host than Conan, if not the greatest
I can't wait for this.
Sweet. This is going to be awesome!
cmon LETS GOOOOOOO!!!! I am so hyped!!!! Go Conan!!!!
Dang I’m so hyped!!!!!!!
The 🐐
Oh, HBO Max, your glory days are coming...
Yessssss. When?!
Conan is so wholesome! I’ve missed him during his time off. So glad he’s back!
Conan as a viking makes vikings considerably less fearsome.
Thank god, the best late night host is back !
Conan is the best to ever do it. I will definitely be watching this. I LOVE CONAN!
Beyond borders was by far some of the best work done by Conan, glad he is able to combine his podcast content with a new travel show! Can’t wait to see this #TeamCoco
How do we get him to come to Perú?😅
I CAN'T WAIT!!! THANK YOU HBO
Where is Sona?!
OMG this is going to be amazing, cant wait
IM SO EXCITED OMG
Conan O Brien Can't Stop -> Conan O Brien Must Go!
This looks so dumb. Just let Conan apologize for thinking he was better than Leno, and give him Fallon’s gig
I love how Conan and James May embraced this
Good luck, lotta pressure! Better be as good as Letterman!
I guess I'll have to subscribe to HBO Max for a month when this comes out.
He is a legend, a true inspiration, a friend that everyone needs, a ray of sunshine in the dark!
Holy f if he doesn't visit Finland :D
Super psyched for this!
Freakin finally!!
Hope he brings some of the celebrity guests along.
they better feature ice cube and kevin hart
I smiled throughout all of this.
im going to get hbo max just for this show
YES! Bonan O'Crien!
When? Where? Keep in mind I'm in Europe
I’m _soooooooooo_ excited!!!
How can I watch it in Germany? Conan I adore you!!!❤
Conan, HBO 🐐 🐐
YESSSSS!!!!
Jordan Schlansky: I'm not in this clip because I was preparing my body in various ways
This seems to be Conan Remotes on steroids. And I'm all for it...
Really was hoping they’d name it “CoCo a GoGo”
Can't get HBO Max in the UK. I hope another streaming platform is able to show this.
The is Conan doing what he does best
I was hoping to see Jordan at least as an easter egg, come on, this is not it without him!
The best man in the world
We all need a friend like conan. I always thought he can definitely meet all those people from conan needs a fan episodes.
❤❤❤ thank you hbo this is exactly what we all want
Finally!!!
inject this straight into my veins
I wish I didn't read the description where it says this series will only be 4 episodes long.
FINALLY
Conan without borders is back
This trailer brings so much joy. Also, is that Schlansky at 2:07??
finally, reason to subscribe
I always loved when Conan would visit different places on his late night show!!!! Having him back on air is great
Okay HBO, i guess I won't cancel my sub right now..
This will get me to re-subscribe to HBO.
It doesn’t surprise me the least if those vocals at the end were Conans at all 😂
The show we’ve all been waiting for!
This is just vlogging with extra steps
Wow. Looks like I gotta actually subscribe to this because I do wanna support Conan. He's the GOAT!
Looking a little pale there!
conan is the goat
Props to conan for always keeping him updated on the current trends..podcast,travel show..good for u..keep going
The king of remotes is back!   A-Cockaroooo!!!
Conan is a legend❤
I couldn't stop smiling omg
Seems like HBO is trying to spend a budget as fast as possible.
OMG. Is this my life now? I've been through youtube 7 times at least. This dude will never age.
Nice
The King returns!
What,  no Jordan?
Was wondering when we would get conan on HBO
I love that the show has the words "Must Go" in it. It's like HBO & Conan heard all of us & responded with love.
omg they actually did it
just come to india at this point🙃🇮🇳
Wait am I gonna have to watch this illegally as well? Sort out HBO in the UK owa m8
HBO Max is still a better name than Max
let's gooo (i've just been binging his animal segments)
OMG, thank you. I was worried this project was cancelled since there was no news about it for over a year.  I'm so excited!
We've been requesting this for YEARS and now it's happening!!!
I legitimately thought Conan was on the next episode of Succession
OMG !!!!!!
GOAT returns
Time to get HBO max!! Love conan
Love this! Hope there’s at least one episode with Jordan Schlansky torturing him though :)
Finally, something to look forward to.
OMG. This looks epic!  I can't wait for it to come out!
Long live the king of late night
that song is really good
It's been 94 years!! 🔥
This is the Conan Without Borders series that I've been saying we need for years
Finally! Where's Joel Goddard???
Conan O' Mutha F#@kin' Brien!!!!!!!
He is a remedy to cynicism
His traveling segments were honestly the best, such a smart move to do this show.   Hope he goes to more places with Jordan in this series😆
I’m so happy that you’re actually visiting some of the fans from the podcast. This is amazing!!!
I've always said Conan is funnier when he's just riffing and doing his own thing than when he's following a script.  And this looks like a whole show of that.  I'm all in
Yes, please 😌
Where is jordan schlansky?
Conan’s new show is the reason I don’t want to end my life.
A Thousand times YES!
Anthony Bourdain rally let himself go
Conan! Come to my strange remote foreign land and...Well I'm from Minnesota, but I want to play cardboard battle bots with you.
Thank you!   I was calling for this since his late night show ended.   He probably needs a friend next season on each trip though.   Conan shines best when he has a celebrity friend to shock with his wit and lack of filter.
When?
Now all you need is Jordan shlansky doing a voice over telling people all the facts and everything factually inaccurate with what Conan Obrien is saying
Conan is the american jeremy clarkson
yyyyeeessssss
Is Jordan going with him?
Go back to Haiti, Conan. I want to see more of this beautiful country, maybe you will even be able to eat long pig there aswell, who knows, many mysteries
YES.. INJECT NEW CONAN CONTENT INTO MY VEINS
Yesssss!!! Finally!
Can I audition to be his sidekick
It's gonna be EPIC!
The Song he recorded (the one playing over this trailer) is HILARIOUS!!!! 100% on Brand with how consistently funny & wonderful Conan ALWAYS is. For us fans of this beautiful man over the years...THIS IS AWESOME!!!!
YEEEESSSSS! He does this SO well. We've been hoping for a travel series with him.
That's it I'm cancelling all my next appointment with my psychiatrist.  This is all I needed.
GOD OF ALL TALK SHOW HOSTS HE'S BACK WITH A BANG LOVE FROM INDIA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
YASSSSS CONAN IS BACK!!!!  I AM SO STOKED FOR THIS. He is going to be our new Anthony Bourdain. This cannot come soon enough.
So is he only going to 2 countries?
No way they knew what everyone wanted
So glad he is doing more stuff. Keep them coming. Conan is the most liked late-night host and the most interesting and smart man compared to the others.
Definitely watching.
Conan never fails to bring the laughs! His unique humor and quick wit always brighten my day. So excited to see him on HBO, and I know he'll continue to deliver top-notch comedy. Keep making us laugh, Conan! 😄🙌
YES
Conan didnt become a propanda puppet like colbert, kimmel, trevor noah, that british dude on HBO, seth meyers, etc.  that people dont actually watch and like.. They're all shills and they're not funny. Conan is the man
OMG. This is amazing. All this random people conan have talked to in his podcast! I am so hyped. Travel Show hosted by Conan - THATS WHAT KNEW WE NEEDED!
It's like a new surprising season of Ricky Gervais' An Idiot Abroad  🤘
How is Conan still the whitest person even with Norwegian Vikings?
So many drone shots
Was waiting and waiting and waiting for HBO to bring this up. Almost seemed like a dream that never gonna get real but thanx HBO, now it feels true. So excited for having the legend and the best in the business of late night show hosts back doing remotes in random countries.
Yes YES YEAH! (And maybe a little Schlansky por favor)
I never paid a subscription in my life, and I think I'll subscribe for HBO max when this comes out.
greatest of all time
Conan is an absolute natural when it comes to meeting people and lowering their guard. If you've ever watched his remotes on the original NBC show, it is probably some of the funniest and most natural stuff you will ever see. Nothing forced and fake like with corden and fallon.
Thank you
I will support anything this man does. I shaped my sense of humor, and the way i conduct myself off of this man. He has been a wonderful inspiration to me.
I think this will be the best show HBO ever made.  Maybe even the greatest miracle of Mankind.
Mf conan is back! So happy it's making me tear up!
Conan's travel series on his late-night show is by far my favorite content I have ever consumed.  I might actually sign up for HBO for this.
I would pay mad money for Jordan Schlansky to join Conan on these trips.
how is Conan so damn likeable?!
I hope Conan brings along Jordan for his trips!
So hype!!! The king is back!!! Lets go!!!!
This got me choked-up happy. Looks so fun.
GOTY
Excited, Funny comedic GOLD is on the way, the remote locations, and humor with people, across the language barrier is hilarious. Best wishes Team cOcO! #teamcoco #conan #conanobrien #conaf #showgoeson #latenight #tonightshow #CONAN #conanobrienmustgoon
Max Weinberg has ordered Conan to go ? Interesting...
Bro that song is pretty catchy.
Wow, that new Bee Gees Song is fire!   :D
Conan is the greatest of all time.
yes.
The King is back!
Conan is a treasure.. by far my favorite comedian
I've been waiting for this.
So excited for this ❤
Finally!!!
I .......................Must Watch... Conan O'Brien Must Go...
Comedy GOD. The Zeus of late night hosts. (Without all the raping and torture)
YOURE KIDDNG ME HAAGAHAAAHHAHHA
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD ITS REAL ITS REALLY HAPPENING RETURN OF THE KING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
the greatest talk show host of the 21st century
Where is schlansky?
We have been asking for this for so long, and here it is. We love you Conan.
Well, I guess I’m subscribing to HBO Max again. Love Conan
Oh - I MUST see this!
Hail Lord Conan. First of his name. Keeper of the flaming pompadour and the self-pleasuring mathan.
We're off on the road to Thailand and Norway.  And maybe a few in between.   We're off on the road with O'Brien and like a day-old Danish pastry, we are filled with cheese!
Conan traveling abroad is the best bit of US diplomacy in the last decade.
Bro thank you his podcast are great but can’t beat classic conan
I didn’t see Jordan which is sad. But if Jordan is in this, than huge wasted opportunity on the trailer. He should have come out of the showdowns with grim music like a teaser.
Brooooooooooooo
Can’t wait to see Conan to make a fool of himself in his travels!
This makes me so happy.
this show is gonna be such a vibe, man
My favorite late night host is back. Can't wait to watch this.
Where is Schlansky in this promo?
1:16 flashbacks from my own  Thai mom 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally a reason to subscribe to HBO Max!
Brilliant! Excited to see all the interesting people he has spoken with.
can't wait
An entire show of Conan remotes!
This makes me happy.
Where’s the date? 😭😱
YES FINALLY
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
What? No Jordan being an expert on everything????
YESSS CONAN I LOVE YOU pls come to India!
THE MOMENT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!!
...to the bathroom a lot
Conan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I cant believe my eyes!!! An Idiot Abroad is baaaack!!!!!!!!
so hyped!
I miss him when he's not around, I am so glad he has something new and randomly Conan coming out. He is just... Such an utterly wonderful break from the insanity of reality. I need this in my life right now.
Oh, my God. So this is why he's been asking his international fans/guests on the podcast, "What kinds of things would we do if I came to visit you?"  How did I not see this coming?
now where is this gonna be in the UK
Love Conan!
Where is JORDAN?!!!!
I haven’t been this excited for anything in awhile so glad he’s back.
Is it likely that Conan without Borders is finished? And this is a new travel show?
This…doesn’t look great but god I hope I’m wrong
YASSSSS
wow!!! I thought HBO Max deal was a bust!!!!! It's really happening ???? wow, after the last of us, another reason to re-sub hbo max
At long. LONG last. He returns
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Can't wait!
No Jordan schlansky
Love it. Can't wait.  All you needed to show was Conan getting beaten up by a kid, and I knew I'd be there with bells on.
This is what we want!!!!!
Please have Jordan travel with him.
Yeah baby woohoo
So down for any Conan content 😊
YES!
So looking forward to this, the best part of his show were always the intern skits and these remotes
I'm sad it's only going to be 4 episodes.
Please come to Germany again :)
Conan is truly America’s national treasure. No one hates Conan
Finally did it!!
Omg I am so freaking happy right now, this is the best news of 2023
DUDEEE!! YES!!!!
Does anybody know what font they used at 2:22?
Conan Travels The World.
The only funny late night host alive! Can't miss this one! Conan we love you!
hey Conan, you're free to visit my country any time as well!
Drown on little saint james
Love it. I wish he comes to Greece
cant wait
LETS's go!!
Yesss!!! More Conan!!!
Can we just recognise that Conan song is a bop?
Why can’t I like this video 50 times more
Conan never disappoints.
I am a deeply emotional man right now.
Is that Conan singing the song in the background?! lmao can't wait for this
Like the great Odysseus of antiquity, who returned home after years of grueling odyssey only to set sail once again for new and thrilling adventures, the mighty Conan returns to a life of glorious comedic travel following retirement from his own odyssey of legendary late night feats.
the wait has been so long, this will be awesome!
Well, I guess I‘ll subscribe to HBO Max then ..
Actual people from the podcast!
Somehow he looks normal in Viking gear...
Finally.
will watch this on burning series faster than you can say "shareholder"
eeyyoo his Lawyers negotiated some JUICY money from HBO for this
No REDservations
This is the only reason I'm getting Max, this is the sole thing that has sold me
Wish I too could pitch a show where I got paid to travel the world 😁
This can't come out fast enough
Now we just Craig Ferguson back and we will have enough comedy for everyone
Conan is the reason I have an HBO subscription. Can’t wait!
I still hope Conan reunites with nemesis Jordan Schlansky and travel the world!
I love how he met up with his fan from his podcast
YES! I’ve waited too long for this! ❤️
While he is no Anthony Bourdain, I think Conan might just fill those shoes...
That does it! I have to re subscribe to HBO maxnow !
Yes.
Why hasn't this guy won a Mark Twain prize?
ConeBone69 is the absolute GOAT! So hyped for this!
He’s back, and more hilarious than ever. 😂😂😂😂
as an avid Conan Needs a Friend listener I can’t wait to watch this
Overproduced Conan is not as fun...
shut up and take my money
give me a release date
About time!!!! Can’t wait for this
I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!
Conan O'Brien travel show is golden.
Been on my daily Conan-marathon  Recently got into his podcast, happy to see Conan doing great things and fun ones too still 😂 one of the bes, not only talk show host, but entertainer himself and person!   Conan Without Borders is a TREASURE! So glad he’s still traveling! HBO you’re doing everyone justice  The song sounds like Conan singing in character too 😂   Edit: It is
CONAN!!!!
This is an amazing spin off to his "needs a fan" series 🎉. Can't wait!
He's BACK! Finally!
I am excited beyond belief.
Aw man, I love Conan!!!! So happy for him on his success! A certain former late night talk show hos must be very jealous, again!!!
YESSS!!!! Finally he is back!!!!
My wife just showed me a clip of him on some show in Thailand from a show he appeared on there
I'm hyped beyond words
THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED
Gonna need way more than 4 episodes, HBO!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait for this 🎉
I will watch this show, so hard!
Please tell me Jordan makes a cameo in this
A king retakes his rightful throne
Yes!!! !My favorite Conan bits were the remotes!
Best thing that will even happen to HBO after GOT.
We love you, Coco!! <3
Conan is the best!! 😭
Does this mean Jordan is back on full pay?
Omg now I have to get hbo Max for a month lol
Finally!
😊😊😊
I love that he's actually fulfilling the semi-promise he has been making to the "Conan Needs a Fan" podcast guests to see them in person someday!
Take Jordan or else its not much of a show.
oh my GODD i've been waiting for something like this!!
YES
They’ve done it… HBO Max wins
We need Jordan Schlansky in atleast an episode of this or more! 😆
YESSSSS !!
wait does conan visit guardsemen?
Very very excited ❤❤❤
Like that recent Eugene Levy travel show except gingerfied
If Jordan Schlasky wasn’t paid while we waited for this we riot
OH my god.. Well, I know what show I want an internship on 😂
WHAT IS THIS SONG???? INCREDIBLE!!!!!
the goat is back
IT’S FINALLY HAPPENING !!!!
This looks....awesome.  Lol
And when the world needed him most, he returned.
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
CONANNNNNNNN we missed you!!
So…guess I’m keeping Max.
Perfect show for the perfect demographic: the one that must go
WHATTTTTYTYYYTYTYTYYYTYYTTYTYTT
Finally!!!
For all of us that said: “we just want Conan to do remote segments for a living”   Y’all, it’s finally here
Second most famous Irish-American after Shaquille O'Neal
CONAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s so cool seeing the fans Conan interviewed on the podcast. He always says he’d love to visit them, and he actually means it!
Yessssssss! I knew it was coming!!!!
NICE!!! Team COCO STRONG!
It's finally happening!😁
Conan is hands down the GOAT for years and years now 🎉🎉 thanks for this series miss him so much on late night.
FINALLY!   I thought this was never going to come out because I thought he was only doing his podcast instead. I look forward to seeing this and I hope it's as good as his other travel videos.
Yes!!!!!!!❤
I got concerned that he was going to bring Matt and sona with him. Having to watch this with sona the laugh track fake cackling the entire episode would have been a disaster
max is on fire. Conan on max and soon wrestling. hopefully they add more soccer.
CONAN!!!!!
They finally did it Conan travel show!
I cannot wait! Please keep these coming. I want to see Conan in every city in every country.
I'm so excited Conan has made me laugh more than anyone ever has. I've listened to so many podcast episodes and love your clips on YouTube. I'm not kidding I have a fantasy that he would come surprisingly visit me and somewhat beat me up like he does to his staff and people he loves. Haha
I'm so excited to see Conan make a special on HBO! These past months I've spent a college semester out in Los Angeles and on my road trip back driving across the states back to New York, listening to his podcast kept me sane driving at night. I miss his talk show so much but I am so glad to see the legend come back!
He's got to drag good 'ol Jordan with him to some of these places.
Return of the pale sickly looking king
I need Jordan to appear in a couple episodes
Yessssss 🎉❤
For those who aren't up-to-date with Conan here's the gist.  Conan has had a top performing podcast named Conan O'Brien needs a friend for more than 4 years now & he regularly does fans episode simultaneously with his main celeb one. So, the fans call him from all over the world & that's where this fits in. The two fans in the trailer from Norway & Thailand had their episodes on podcast & now he visited their country to do fun remotes with them.
THIS IS A MASSIVE W! Missed seeing Conan, he is the greatest nightshow personality ever.
Can't wait to see this.
YES!
Lessfuckinggooooo boys
Whaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!
LETS GOOOO
Love that the podcast turned to this!
Whats the premiere date??
Looks like Conan without Borders on steroids!! So cool 😁
So. Stoked. 🤘
Damn can't wait
Jordan will be happy about this😂
Pumped
the song slaps
they only needed to show me the first 10 seconds and I'd be watching every episode same-day
#bringbackjordanschlansky
Awesome!
bali❤ and conan😂🎉❤ the best
I want him going around the world with his Italian friend
the goat
I miss this guy
About damn time HBO.
Finaaaaallllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍
Finally, Jordan would be able to afford all his body preparations.
Oh well I guess it's better than another GD podcast.
electric
Conan, come to India. We will plan everything for you!!❤
There's nothing like a Conafide Conification of a Conan O'Brien
YES!!!! I have a reason to watch television again 😭
YESSSS
Well this is awesome
It's just not the same. I miss the Late Night days. I've lived through so many renaissances, you don't realize how good you have it till it's over. The Attitude Era, Late Night With Conan, the "Tough Crowd" comedy era, Opie and Anthony, Hip-hop, etc. The list goes on. If I knew it was all going to be downhill after that, I think I'd rather have appreciated it more. I just thought things would get better, not worse.
THE KING. HAS. RETURNED.
This looks awesome!
The hype is real!
this will make him shine. conan is so wildly educated, witty and also decent and kind that he truly shines in unscripted moments. the only late night host who can hold a candle to his blend of intellect and character is colbert. but conan is waaaaaay funnier since goofier and more self-depreceating. this will be ITTTT
There is never enough Conan
🎉🎉🎉  Also what's that song he's singing?
Yes! Finally :D
Can't wait 😁
Hopefully, Conan gave Jordan Schalansky his deserved job of Associate Producer.
I cannot wait. Conan's back! Conan is my hero, this brought a tear of joy to my eyes.
The GOD returns brace for it ya'll
Conan is the real-life BFG taking us all to Dream Country with him.
Just Conan living his best life!
I hope Jordan was there every step of the way to point out any inaccuracies and infractions on local customs, with utmost detail and elaboration, which I am sure Conan greatly appreciated.
YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
the best show on HBO
He’s BACKKKKKK
YASSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! This hasnt aired but I already need another season 😅
conan on HBO is what we've needed for 30 years
Wow!! I am so happy now. He did go see them!  Conan is the best!
Finally! Also, should i be calling in to Conan?
YEEEEAEAEAEHAEHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!
Tengo Que ver esto, Conan siempre me hace reír🤣
AWESOME!!!!
I am so glad I survived the pandemic for this epic adventure.   The world isn't ready.  My body ain't ready.  I need to prepare my body in various ways.
Vikings did not use horns, that is a fact.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
DAMN IT! I need to subscribe to HBO again now
God I love Coco.  He's like a human anti-depressant.
HE IS BACK!!!
He is the absolute best

YASSSS!!!! SOOOO EXCITED!!!!! WOOO!!!!
IT’S HAPPENING!!!
The prophecy has been fufilled
I’ve been waiting for this for so long!
Finally!!! He's back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MY DREAMS HAVE FINALLY COME TRUE!!!!! 😭😭😭
I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only 4?? I was hoping at least 8-12
Hahaha. I just listened to the podcast with the young guy from Norway the other day. It was really funny. That's cool he surprised the guy AND did some shenanigans with him.
His travel segments were always prime late night so a Conan travel show is gonna be lit
The KING is back!  LOVE U CONAN
Wow is he going to start taking up all the offers on Conan O'Brien Needs a Fan? Waited two years for his new HBO show, and if this is it, worth the wait
Brace yourselves for the return of the KING
Damn, this is the content I want for an HBO subscription
YES CONAN!
Love Conan. The only late night guy that could make me laugh.
Yesss!!! Definitely gonna watch this. Thanks HBO
GOD IS BACK
Very excited to see Conan out and about on a platform he deserves
I. Am. So excited. I hope Jordan joins him along the way.
HELLS YEAH!
Ooh this is going to be amazing 😍
This show will be even more perfect with Jordan Schlansky.
One question: WHEN????
This looks like genuine fun for Conan. Looking forward to ikt
I’m so excited!!!!
Conan Can't Stop, Must Go!
Does this means Jordan can finally stop doing Cameo videos for a living?
The only reason I am subscribing HBO max
please stop making travel shows w millionaires!!!! millionaires don’t interact w new cultures like regular ppl do!!! give talented travel vloggers like damon dominique and jo franco the travel shows they DESERVE 😤
Gosh so excited for this!!! I listened to all of the CONAF episodes and can’t wait to see what they did in all these countries! HBO is killing it with hot shows recently ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Just In: HBO Max has announced that Conan O'Brien Must Go will now be hosted by Jay Leno.
People who loves conan without border will love this . I will miss  jordan schlansky
Conan O'Brien Can't Stop to Conan O'Brien Must Go......Can't Waitttttttt🥲
CoCo's back!!! 😀
i wish they kept the "without borders" name. it really felt in tune with conan's personality but i guess it was TBS's thing
bad trailer but it will be good
Damn Conan looked awesome with that Viking beard
About fuc#ing time. As much as I like his podcast, I missed the remotes.
He was in Oslo and I missed him 😭😭
This is what we want and need!! I'm so hyped for this!!!
Yesssss🎉🎉🎉🎉
Whole time when he was in Seoul, I was like "Man, wonder what he would think of my city (Bangkok)" and then the madman actually did it. Wild.
Tune

Conan is the man
