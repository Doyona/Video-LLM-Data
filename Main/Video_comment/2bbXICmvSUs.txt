0:33 Squirrel has a sudden revelation; discovers the meaning of life.
This was most of us in 2020
someone slipped him a shroom?  looks like he's seeing god!
Simply... wonderfull
_Shroom-Season_
🤣🤣🤣
Poor thing...
Am I the only person that knows this is a symptom of rabies?
Type marula fruit in search. You'll see a drunken army of hammered critters. Crazy fun.
Give him some pot brownies and watch the fun
Nam memories starting to kick in ... :D
....Charges are pending, "to get a minor intoxicated"!!
then he ran immediately over to the local Denny's for a grand slam breakfast!
🤣Hahah haha omg sooo friggin cute and funny 😆 ❤️can totally relate 😂
Jajajajaja se pasan 😂👁️👄👁️
LIL RED THE LUSH  :)
Never do this on purpose - just for 'a video', 'likes' - to animals, alcohol cannot be metabolised; we have bigger livers, by % of mass.
Its a real life Conker the Squirrel
it problably has rabbies
Saw this on the dodo in my news feed. Funny. But, not to worry, all of the animals like to get drunk in the winter. And the preditors, upon seeing this lil guy walking and acting all weird, will not pounce on it as it looks and acts sick to them and they will not eat such a sick animal. Only the buzzards will and only once it is dead.  But, I spent a winter in michigan with some folks who had an apple farm. And one very still snowy night with a full moon and I heard the weirdest sound coming from the orchards sounding like some drunk dude. I was reassured it was the local bears getting drunk on the fermented apples and were "singing". They said that there were to be sure that all of the other local animals were all out there getting drunk that night. It seems that in such events that preditors and prey alike all forgo their normal activities and all get drunk at the same time. So, the next day, we went out there and you could see where each animal type had their drinking tree and left their marks of pee, poop, apple bits, thrashed snow, and some cases, slightly thrashed trees. No one hunted the others and the "others" felt no fear of the preditors as they all knew this was the time for all to belly up to their tree and tie one on. The local woods must have had some horrible sounds the next day of all the hungover animals out there!  So, next time you have fermented fruit, feel free to set it out as the squirrels have a right to tie one on too!
Dude, you're like my best friend...seriously.
How to best recreate this phenomenon?
conker??? eres tú??
Off his nutz
Oh nooooo. lolz. Poor buddy.
К белке - белка пришла)))))))
Red squirrels are little demons they getting your attic in the winter time and make a mess of things you think you have mice but it's not it's a red squirrel! However I do not believe in animal cruelty which this is what it looks like to me! Why would you put out fermenting pears do you not know what happens do you not know what happens to you when you get too much to drink yeah you look like an idiot also! You people that think this is funny are clueless! I see nothing funny about it! If you're going to try and kill a red squirrel you might as well shoot it because at least it's not suffering from alcohol poisoning because that's what it is you poisoned him or her whatever it is. I know that when people get alcohol poisoning they are very sick and almost dead and some people do die from it but it's a miserable death! This is just wrong!
Conker's Bad Fur Day sequel looks great!

Le pauvre j'espère qu'il n'a pas été malade

How can *YOU* receive the free *GIFT* of *SALVATION* and *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)
Почему это видео у меня в просмотренных, если я его не смотрел?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  아 웃겨.
I like how YouTube is now putting the correct videos on trending.
Pretty impressive that even falling-over drunk, their balance reflexes are so strong that he still catches himself at the last second...twice, at least.
Sitting somewhat squirrely in the back of a church basement at yesterdays AA meeting was a bleary eyed tree rodent named Robert. He sipped coffee and ate a cookie.
The Last Leg anyone?
dang! he got into the good shit!
He lowkey be high on nuts   👁👅👁
Ale się napierdoliła
@Korah estas viendo esto???
да да.. закуси милая .. закуси.. закусывать надо!!!
Me watching 2020 go by
Poor thing has no idea wtf is wrong with it.
5G it Works!
The pear tree in my back your dropped a lot of pears one year. As they rotted and fermented in the sun, wasps were attracted by the odor. Hilarity ensued. They got so drunk they couldn't fly. Some could get airborne, but immediately crashed. They stumbled and fell when they walked. Cheap entertainment for days.
Thank heavens no hawks were around. Hate to see a hawk drunk..
белка поймала белку !
Белка поймала "Белку"!
Is it true that IdH tipsified the squirrel?!?!?😂😂😂 I thought IdH is good for hangover XD 🍐🐿 Sooo cute...😍😭
тот случай когда "белочка" пришла сама к себе
Me when I said the edibles ain't shit
Dislike man, very bad to poison animals.
Бабушка рассказывала, как накормила кур вишнями, которые уже начали портиться, а сама ушла в магазин. Когда вернулась, куры валялись по всему двору, словно дохлые. Тогда она их ощипала (чтобы собрать перья на перину) и сложила в кучу для дальнейшей утилизации, но когда снова вышла во двор, пьяные и голые куры уже проснулись и расхаживали по двору, занимаясь своими обычными куриными делами.
На Орехи налегай, закусывай...
비틀대는 다람쥐 너무 귀엽다
Someone obviously drugged a squirrel. That’s animal abuse, not humour.
From LiRed's perspective, things have become a little squirrely. He or she, looks stoked and full-up.
штырит.
Хватит издеваться над животными
Накормили белку какой-то гадостью, и всем очень смешно? Посмотрите, как ей плохо! Это сделали уроды!
К белке белка пришла!
залипает как под опиатами
안되나요??나를 사랑하면~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~뭐?!!!!!!!!!!빌어먹을 놈의세상 한잔더~~~♬♪
Белочка впервые встретила вертолеты
даже белка больше кайфует в этой жизни чем я))
2020 was to NUTS for him he couldn't take it 😂
Больше на герыч похоже, чем на алкоголь. Хозяка нам чего то не договаривает)
I know how he feels been like that a few times myself!!
Lol I watch that in Bulgarian tv news 😂😂😂
oh shit that's good...ooops...hope nobody saw that...have another bite to be safe.
Когда выпил 10 бутылок водки чтобы вывести радиацию и ждёшь пока не попустит

So basically, he's Conker.
What a cutie, hope he/she doesn't get a hangover! haha
Lol that’s something you don’t see every day 😆
Only in Minnesota
The only good squirrel is an intoxicated one.

Sometimes it be like that tho
Poor little squirrel.
He looks like he's flashing back to 'Nam.
So, pears makes the best hooch i see.  Go squirrel go!  Shot shot shot shot.
I won't believe squirrels get drunk until I see one spew and get a kebab - in that order!

Are you sure this isn't acorny joke?
Officially this is my patronus!
Poor  Little thing 😭😢😩
We call this the Dope Fein Lean
"Hello, this is your Daily Dose of Internet."
You should be ashamed of yourself. That is cruel and inhumane. Pathetic. All for the sake of a stupid video.
People think this is cute but unfortunately I think the squirrel is very unwell , they get many diseases
May seem "cute" to many, but the squirrell in this state is in a very vulnerable, defenseless, exposed position. It could not escape predation in a state like this. Not recommended.
"the woods are spinnin'...lawd how am I gonna get home..."
Me, 45 mins later after taking 3 shots of Hennessy only 5 seconds from the first.
It has rabies it isn't drunk!! It should of been killed
I've read they prefer the fermented fruit over non fermented
"Excuse me waiter, I'll have what he's having"
I love squirrels, I put out seed for them around my house
the way ma da stands after coming back home every Friday night fae the pub, trying to talk shite to me in the hallway
YOUR SICK!! SHAME ON YOU!!
I wonder if he got bed spins and puked.
This explains why he's naked.
Don't know why this is trending but very cool

I'm cordially inviting Mr. Squirrel to my 60th b-day bash that will take place in non other then Las Vegas. Wayne Newton will MC.
been there too little buddy
Drunk, eh? Are you sure you didn't lace the pears with LSD?
I needed this laugh, thank you! 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭 Happy Thanksgiving!
Were the pears taken away once they were found to be fermented or were they left there for other little critters to possibly get drunk too? I mean, it’s pretty thoughtless and mean after that.....
Рашен белка
the squirrel was later arrested for CWI- climbing while intoxicated
The Gov of Pennsylvania needs to pass a law to stop animals from getting drunk
That was funny lol he was doing the matrix lol 😀😀
Feeling good
Seizures
And yet he thinks..."I'll have some more!"
I read once about this train that derailed in the Midwest. Nobody hurt, but it took a while to clean up the mess and meanwhile all these apples and ears of corn were left to ferment in the sun. A bunch of bears got a whiff of the bounty and came over for a snack. Next thing was, trains passing through that area had to slow down on account of all the totally blitzed bears sitting dazedly on the tracks. When honked at a few would glance blearily at the honker and then hold their heads in their paws as if to say "Kill me and get it over with" or "Jeez, man, stop with the noise, my head is splitting"
Didn't know that a drunk squirrel was what I needed to start my day
Adorable! Just so you know: in Russian, the state of extreme drunkness when one experiences hallucinations is cold "white fever", a slang word fr it is "belochka", from "white=belyj". Funny enough "squirrel" is "belochka". It is a very common slang word and we often joke about how one sees "squirrels" when totally drunk :)
Congrats you were on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon !
Thats that shit they gave Lee Harvey Oswald.
Looks eerily similar to rabies
Who got here from MSN?
So you poisoned a squirrel and then you recorded it for a few minutes? Then it fell to its death... What a role model you are. Jackass
A bowl of fermented pears, THAT'S AMORE!   For more silliness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iO1xpW1HhE&feature=emb_rel_end
Omgggg 😂😂😂 cheers guys 🍻🍺🍻🍺😁 we all know that feeling right 😉😀🙈🙊
This is too funny.
goes back for more at the end haha get this squirrel some help
Next time make chunks of pot brownies
Take 2 and call me in the morning...🤣🤣🤣
lol
Save water. Eat fermented pears.
Borrachito!
The squirrel will wake up with an stuff animal squirrel and be like, "Omg, I killed her, hide the evidence!" Lol
looks like he got into  pappy's shine!  owh weee
SqurrieLean
I feel bad for for the poor thing. He’s probably afraid
Just imagine a squirrel bar somewhere...
I love how at the end he doesnt learn and goes in for more
I know of a rehab place!!!😅🤣
Looks like the heroin lean to me.
At 0:29 - “I’m gonna hit it again.”
Hes got those darn bed spins.
Unfortunately, I’ve been like that on more than one occasion
So did someone just leave fermented pears in a bowl outside for no reason? Seems like animal cruelty.
Sandy is completely zooted
LOL if you think this is entertaining, you should have seen the bluejays when they'd get into the fermented windfall mulberries in my childhood home's yard. Lots of squawking, flapping, and crashing! Like the drunken fratboys of the avian world.
The latest reincarnation of Dean Martin
Katy!!  Contributing to the delinquency of a squirrel.  Fun to see you and your kiddos.
I shouldn't, OK just one more
and his life was never the same....
LOL esta hasta el huevo!
Awww so cute.....I wanna be high! 🥳
My man is contemplating life.
Looks like me on a Friday night! 😂
how does he/she come home? :D
I wish I had this experience in class throughout grad school.
Quick, bash it with a rock!!
And then he goes back in for more
My professor just sent this to our whole class.... my mans is goated

Epileptic Squirrel
It's conkers bad fur day!
That’s hilarious! Hopefully he doesn’t OD 😂
needed this good laugh thank you
I have a honey locust tree that has pods with seeds that dry up in winter.  I have seen the fox squirrels eat these and act all weird.  I assumed the seeds fermented in the pods and the squirrels were getting wasted.  Freaking hilarious.
Been there, done that.
This just made my morning🤣🤣😂😂😂. It's good to know I'm not the only one who can't handle the sauce🤣🤣😂😂
Oh my goodness, poor little thing.  Please don't put out any more fermented foods!   Luckily, he was able to survive, but being drunk would likely make the squirrel more susceptible to an attack.  The squirrel predators are so vicious.  We have lost squirrels to fox, enormous black birds, etc.
Awesome....LOL
You sure those weren't 'shrooms in the bowl?

Those may be fermented pears that he's eating but that looks a lot like a heroin nod to me.
실화?
잌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 귀여웤ㅋㅋㅋ 램쥐쓰ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
She said the pears were in the fridge and got fermented. Lie as fermentation requires heat. She also fed the tainted pears to her pigs which is proof she is abusing them with alcohol. Isn't that why the pigs didn't eat them? Then she put a camera to film the squirrels getting drunk. She's sick. Period.
Even the squirrels have had enough of 2020!!!  I am with ABC7 in the SF Bay Area, any chance you'd be willing to allow us to use it?
He’s had too many i gotta take the bowl away
This looks eerily similar to some of the Disney animatronic fails I've seen in the parks!
Imagine that :)
Psychologist: To go forward, find your spirit animal. My spirit animal:
Wait -- do we look that silly when we're loaded?
Poor little thing
i found your movie on Italian news paper called "LA STAMPA" i think this video will become viral  , take a look :  https://video.lastampa.it/la-zampa/lo-scoiattolo-si-ubriaca-mangiando-le-pere-fermentate-l-effetto-dell-alcol-e-immediato/124485/124607
哈哈哈哈。
Hello....I work for KMSP-TV in Minnesota. Would we be able to use your video?
Can relate to this squirrel. Could we possibly feature this clip in a news story on metro.co.uk and our FB page? With credit and links back, of course!
