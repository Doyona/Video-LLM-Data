I’m so pleased that I contacted Jonny about this car on behalf of my friend Lyn. The video captures the day perfectly. This was a whole days work and the team were obviously true enthusiasts engrossed in not only the Granada but it’s history and meaning for the family. This has given them happy memories to look back on. Thanks Jonny for a great day!
Sounds like you have had a bad time! Glad you're back on the road!
That was me with every Granada i had ( 4 in total) trying to get them started !
Never had a Ford Granada, but used to work on these as an apprentice back in the 80s, absolutely loved them.
Never heard of this b4 wow its amazing
FORD , usually as soon as you move the fan control to it's number 1 position the aic-con should engage. The 1 wire alarm just pull the lead off Sparkrite £20 now, probably £10 then.
Does  it have a v6 or 4cyl
I used to live 2 doors away from there (that has the gas monkey van on the drive way)
At 19:22, was that a reference to the Top Secret, the jail scene?
They were ford falcons in aussie and new zealand. Most came out with a 4.1 sraight 6.
Isn’t the name because of the red wine color?
Hi, I’ve just been looking back at some old barn find episodes, don’t know how I missed this gem! As soon as the garage door lifted I recognised the chasseur decal. What an amazing thing, my uncle had an x reg face lift 2.0 L which was pretty awesome in its day. When I worked at a ford main dealership one of my customers had a 2.8 ghia x estate that towed his rally car around. This was a real trip down memory lane. Thanks Johnny, I bloody love this channel.
👍👍great
It's official! I feel old!! Thanks Jonny!🤣🫣 I remember these Chasseur Granadas when they were new. A chap called Mike at Old Colfeians Bowling Club had one in '83. Haven't seen one for years and though not a Ford guy, am pleased this one has been preserved.  Steve (57) 😂
Dad had a Granada 2.3 v6 auto salon as a tow car you didnt notice you had the caravan on the back even at some naughty speeds 80mph. was a very nice Metalic green . No one got stuck behind us on our way to Holiday
Why rev the nuts off a cold engine, especially one thats been stood for a while. Not very mechanically sympathetic.
Such a typical sound. The 2.8 ford v6. It just fits the granada so wel❤
At last a cool entry car that cool blue granada❤
I had one of these it had bags in boot 2 each side I think
I’m in Perth Western Australia and I had one of these. We called them Cortina’s. mine was a TE 79 Spac. Metallic dark blue with a 4.1 6cyl. It’s my favourite car. Really enjoying your show.
since you are a die-hard car journalist, is it possible for you to do some kind of presentation about the cars built by Coleman&Milne, I have one similar project here in Finland and here o. only two limousine Granada made by Coleman and two Scorpio limousines in the entire country of Finland. here we only have a little information about those coleman&milne cars
My friends dad had one rotting away in his back garden for over thirty years
No way he died on his birthday.
I had one same had the leather cases in the back  TRX gold alloys 2.8j automatic  25 years ago I also had an early MK2 2.8j manual with leather seats saloon VHK440S (Later Sweeney is VHK491S) And a MK1 consul GT Daytona yellow  But that was a basket case
Did You Buy It ? , Two Bothers that were Fantaticle about their " Grandads" im Sure one of them had a Chassueur , Top Car 👍👌  How Much did it go for ?
Brought a massive grin to my face did that.
Wow. It looks like an old falcon
The TRX tyres transformed the Granadas handling totally.
Such a solid old car, in very good condition. Amazing barn find. Buy it!!❤
I have had a Escort 1,6 Ghia and two Sierra Plaza 2.0 with overhead camshafts and with sunroof. My father was employed as a police officer in the police technical department, which drove both the version you have found now and the version you drove at the beginning, both as station wagons here in Denmark. I love those cars
Another great find, brilliant 😊
I happen to own a Granada Mk1 from 1975 Ghia in that very same blue (miami blue metallic) and automatic for real and a Granada Chasseur as a model car in 1:18. The perfect combination. :) I'm curious to know what happened to that Chasseur?
in australia that is a common ford XD style
I had two mk1 a 2ltr and 3ltr great cars also had mk2 saloon gold 2.8
I’m old enough to still remember seeing Mk2 Granadas on the roads, but until recently never knew of the existence of the Chasseur model. What a motor.
Its nearly dark.it takes you so long
The design of those wheels is totally US spec Ford truck from the same era ch-ch-ch-check it out man!
What happened here, did Jonny buy the car? Only just seen this
Great cars these old granadas. My Brother had a 2.8 Ghia saloon. Despite it having the nickname of The Exxon Valdez, due to the amount of oil that leaked out of it, it was a cool car. 👍🏻
OMG I had one of these cars back in the early 90s. Loved it. Great memories
Disappointed a full around shot of the car in all it's gallory is needed😟
My dad had a mi2 taxi edition and it was a taxi only came in black  W reg 2.8L I’m sure it was loved it
The mk1 you were driving was better imo
😁😁😁😁
Ford were really “on their game” in the 80’s, run by enthusiasts not the current idiots.  Jonny, if it had A/C the heater control would say “Air Conditioning” and would have a green shade instead of red/blue
Class lukn
For business and pleasure *cuts to next shot and aerial shoots up lol  Fantastic series Jonny, love it.
Chasseur means Hunter in French. In English it would have been called Ford Granada Shooting Break.
Cannot believe I've only just found this video. Absolute peak Granada, love it 👌
Well everyday is a school day, I didn’t know ford used metric tyres, I always had cortinas escorts capris fiestas, sierras, I was after a mk3 Granada but never actually got 1, I didn’t know about the chasseur, I’d heard if it in the sierra.  I’ve now a mk5 fiesta and mk3 mondeo. I came across your channel with the allegro build and fab co princess I’ve watched all those episodes and I’m going through the barn find videos. Great stuff Jonny keep up the good work 👍
I'd forgot how nice these cars are. Most cars look best in estate. I've always been a fan of a big Ford....... just beautiful 😍  Did you buy her? Dont they look like a long, flat Range Rover?
Absolutely epic
Saw one ,owned by the director of Alexaders of Greenock .Main  Ford dealer in 1980.❤
What a stunnigly beautiful granada.cant say any fairer than that!
Every garage in the Late Break show are so narrow. How could anyone get out of their cars?
Nice car
I had 2 mark one Granada's in late 70s. Juicy but didn't care when it was £1 per gallon.  Purple and then a Sebring red one. Mark 2 was less attractive.
Great topic barn finds Johnny, a car that's not on anyone's radar or forgotten the ford probe 2,5 24v I have one road legal and tax mine a early model as its electric blue very rare, I know their's only about 30 of that colour on the road today far as I know, mine was in dry store up until 2021 so if you fancy featuring a episode in the future would that be something you would be interested in filming.
Just  watch in Australia  did it sell??
Which engine is in the Chasseur?
Was just thinking of a Ford Granada and this video pops up, the algorithm works.
I remember them all 😊the Mk2 Ford Granada Chasseur Estate, Mk5 Cortina Carousel Estate plus the Ford Cortina Mk5 Crusader Estate... They were the in-between cars of the top of the range and the bottom of the range with fancy names..
Only c. 600K Subscribers ? The best car channel by far
Old Fords had so much class, for people who were born in the 70's these episodes are the best. They bring back fond memories. It's nice to see some have survived.
The Chasseur is an odd name for a car.  I think chasseur is the French word for casserole.
Just seen this video. At the end, probably not a bad thing it ran out if fuel given the colour of the old fuel that came out of it, especially if its gone back to sleep for X amount of time more
The only Granada in the USA, was a boxy plain Jane vehicle, no station wagon version was available. We did have the Mercury Capri that was also sold overseas but didn’t do well in the states as it was so poorly built.
I remember the model and remarked instantly that it was to do with Olympics, that said I have only ever loved fords
You think those are big, look up what a North American Grenada was.
LOVE your show Jonny 🥰I was  wondering do u have a video on  the cars u have
Looks like the milometer doesnt work. Last few mot’s have been 49,999.. 😂
I hope it goes off now to be cleaned and cherished and loved. Difficult to guess the value but I feel that Jonny’s friend may want to have this for himself. My Dad had the Metallic Fern Green 3.0 Ghia Estate and then the later 2.8 Cologne GLS in red, but the older Ghia was always his and my absolute favourite 👌✅
The Granada was so much different in Europe than in the US.   That's a good-looking car.
so much better than the American Granada
This has become my dream Ford
I swear blind when that eventually fired up I could smell it what a cracker
I remember out in the colonies of New Zealand at the time of your Grenada & 1980 Olympics, that duo tone paint scheme would appear on other Fords like Cortina with Pinto and Escort. They came in the showroom with various duo tone paint scheme's like Roman Bronze & creme or Light blue / dark blue being the ones that come to mind. I know someone will comment why I made the distinction of Pinto. We in here in NZ got the choice of either UK builds, or the option of aussie built CBU Fords. The aussie units had as an option the inline 6 cylinder Ford Falcon engine 200ci ( 3300cc), or 250ci ( 4100cc ) engines in the Mk4 ( aussie TE ) and Mk5 ( aussie TF ) in the Cortina range sedan & estate. Incidentally, the period transit got the same offerings.  Thanks for sharing Lyn's step dads Grenada workhorse.❤
i had a Granada estate (red), bought it off my uncle. absolute beast of a car, loved driving it.
Tell me it’s still for sale pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaassssssseeeeeeee
Yet another car I would love to have.  How do you resist picking up the good ones?
you phillistine, i want to see MORE mk II granadas, loved these cars.
for an extra 500 could have had the injection engine with options pack.  wow, all that car for ten grand
used to wash and wax and hoover one of these for a client many years ago. took all morning.  but 40 quid for a mornings work in 1991 was happy days
"Chasseur" is just French for 'Hunter'. Also 'shooter'. My Dad had a Sierra Estate and he used to call it a 'shooting brake'.
I didn't need to see a man's arse/underpants hanging out of his jeans! 20m 20s
My dad had a Chasseur from new. I have fond memories of wafting to Wales in it during the holidays
Thats a really specially car, i hope it stays well preserved and taken care of. If it gets sold dave should own it!
Jonny my mum Austin Westminster was tmthe same colour gold strip with brown paint and was the queen's colours and my mum loved the Austin Westminster 3. 0 ltr
Anyone remember Chicken Chasseur?
Very interesting. Amazing find. Had a 2.8GL in the early 80s. Loved it.
A shattteur is an appropriate name too
Seen jonnys 2.6 mk1 today at the start
Super rare, I've had hundreds of cars, read all the mags back in the day. That's a first for me. Love that interior, retsto mod the engine and g box. Use it.
I know it may seem a little late to comment, but, Australia, and the UK had a lot to do with Ford cars between them, for example.. Capris, Escorts, Cortinas.. did, anyone ever bother to check, the Ford XD Falcon with the Granada..?.. the front and sides look very much like the 1979/80 Falcon, the Australian Falcon had at the time, I believe, 4 engines for it, a 3.3 ltr inline 6 cyl, a 4.1ltr inline 6cyl, a 302 V8 engine, and also a 351 V8 engine, might be worth checking out.. 🙂🙂🙂
Were these based on the falcon out of Australia?
Holy crap.. why was he ragging it while it's stone cold???
I think the saloon version was the talisman? Basically a GL,S
My parents had a contina estate we did some miles in that i even remember the reg ....gya998t how great is that
I remember Granada Chasseur was built in 1984 in the Ford Cologne plant. An earlier, 1981 built is news to me. What is the VIN of this beautiful car?
I just found this series a few weeks ago, and I love your doing this with kinda normal ass cars. Being almost 50 years old its very interesting to see 80's cars come into favor as classic cars. For most of my life it was the usual 50's-60's cars that were revered.
1000 likes!!!
Absolutely loved my Silver 2.8i Ghia X which I bought when I was 22 in 1989 super smooth
I worked at a Ford garage when these editions were launched - posh car back in the day !
Shame it’s not been driven as it’s currently on a SORN.
lovely. :) (in after everyone else) I don't "remember" those, as my dad used to drive Renault 4, and later Toyota Starlet estate, before the divorce and everything and he moved out. myself, I learned car mechanic on Opel, and when I was almost done a Taunus Mk2 estate showed up as an used car (Mk4 cortina to you guys), in signal green and green interior, and I got infected with Ford; it became my first car. in 95 I decided to visit a Knudsen-Taunus meet in northern germany where I got additionally infected with that nose. :) I'd visit a handful of Ford and other classic car meets, and came across a Chasseur Granada a couple times, I think there were three or four different individuals. one of them was turbocharged courtesy of Michael May of Switzerland(tm), I think it had 250HP? the cars, as I remember, were in good condition, not as preserved as this one, but complete and cared for. the abovementioned Knudsen-metting was held by a collectoir who came across the most rarest of german factory-made Fords: a 1974 Wagon with 2.3 litre V6, metallic paint, "Ghia" interior, and vinyl rooftop. they made 5 of them in different colours to see how it would look, and how much effort it would be to determine the price tag. then decided time wasn't ready for them, and they got sold to Ford-people. one ended up with that collector, who wondered about the setup mentioned nowhere in no ad flyer anywhere, and did research. (which triggered the collecting, as he admitted) at the time, early 90's, 4 of the five cars were still existing. the 2.3 wasn't available until the 79 facelift as well as the Ghia interior, only the wagon never had the wood lining on the door cards like those 5 prototypes, so they were way ahead of time. :) side note: the roof rack seems to have been an option to at least early Mk2 Taunus wagons, but I've encountered only one, on top of a very rusty 78 wagon. I offered to buy it, but they never reacted, and I guess it's long been scrapped.
Shouldn't run it without changing the timing belt!if that  snaps,that lovely old original engine is over
Love it ❤ brings back my youth remember my dad with a cortina estate never forget the smell in green top video
I actually owned a Granada estate back in 78 - 82 the previous model and 3.0L great car paid £1800 sold it 82 for 1250.
This is literally porn for banger drivers
When the Consul/Granada series was introduced in Germany, Ford´s sales dropped considerably. The styling did not attract buyers into the showrooms. People went for BMW, Mercedes and the newly restarted Audis. When Ford introduced the Granada´s successor Scorpio, things got even worse. Ford Literally lost the "big" car market to Audi, BMW and Mercedes. Opel made the same mistake.
I owned one had it for a while until it was stolen and subsequentialy written  off , i was absolutely gutted , myself and the wife absolutely loved that Car , and when my Daughters were Babies that car swallowed all the equipment with ease , prams , pushchairs , and the like, tyres were very expensive though and you had to shop around for suppliers, Fantastic episode brought back fond memories.Thanks.
I had a '78 2.8GL ('cos I did not want the hassle of GLX or Ghia extras or the insurance that they entailed), with the Pierburg carb.  When starting from cold it was essential to dab the throttle pedal gently to reset the automatic choke to it's start position.  Failure to do so (ahem, only a few times yer Honour) made it a pig to start.
To me the Granada was a cortina on steroids.  Both fantastic cars though..  oh and fantastic show johnny, keep it going..
wish we woyuld have gotten this style in the US for the Granadas
Get your trousers on you're knicked!
Fantastic .........
Limited edition of 500 to celebrate the Moscow olympic games with sportmen graphics. half leather interior with chatham inserts, complete with 4x load compartment luggage holdalls & keys
As soon as I saw the chasseur decals I recognised them. Not sure I’ve ever seen one on the road but I do remember them. My dad had three granadas as company cars. An L reg GXL , M reg GXL and later a 1980 2.8 Ghia in pale green metallic. That was a stunning car.
Damn, that sounds good
This has brought back so many childhood memories.  My dad had a limited edition Granada 80 limited edition 2.8 ghia x estate . Had so many good days out in it .
21:30  only on three , how do you notice the difference between 6 or 3 cil ...... or did you think it was the famous inline four , Anyway a nice presentation of the rebirth a proper ford stationwagon
Things brings back memories. My parents emigrated (our family) to Australia in December 1980, 5 days before Christmas when I was 9. Our hire car to the airport was a Granada and we thought it was fancy as our family car in England was a MK1 Escort estate, the only car I remember. Our first car in Australia was a 1980 XD Ford Falcon Station Wagon, a poverty pack 3.3l 6 cylinder, they were normally 4.1 litre. The Ford global design is amazing. This looks exactly the same as the XD Falcon except for the rear styling and interior. The Granada looks to be halfway between a Cortina and a Falcon. The 2.8l 4 cylinder 'tow car' did make me chuckle. Over here, nobody would tow with anything less than a 6 cylinder. Usually a 4.2 or 5.0 litre V8...  So nice to see cars of this era preserved. Over here, the 80's cars are all but gone...
I loved the square Granada. I had a boyfriend owned 2.0 beige coloured one, XLR 65S. (saloon not estate)  I'll never forget, it got written off by a young mechanic from the local garage who was testing a little Toyota before it went back to its owner after having work done. He didn't see my bf waiting to turn into a road on the right (with its HUGE indicators) and he ploughed into the back of the Granada with such force the whole boot caved in. it no longer resembled a saloon. The boyfriends seat back fell flat with the impact and he ended up in the back seat.  The sad thing was it happened on my birthday and my boyfriend was supposed to be picking me up to go to Nottingham to get an engagement ring for me and that night we had a celebratory meal organised (not as it mattered after the crash)
Looks a bit ;like the last Model Aussie Cortina faclifted
I remember as a 14 year old our neighbour having a Volvo that was soon replaced with a poor man's Porsche as I called it but was better known as a Saab 99 in metallic black with  3 spoke alloys and a black foam spoiler of sorts and an interior like some Mig fighter jet, he absolutely adored that motor and I had the envious job of washing it every weekend for £3.00 .. I'd have done it for free in all honesty .. but one day after returning from school I was shocked to see the Saab was no more and in its place was a Ford XR3 on approval, a week later a Ford Sierra XR4i and Finally a Ford Cortina Crusader ''Special Edition" Of all the Ford's he'd had on approval the Cortina was just like a Box to me, it lacked any features despite being a Special Edition, lacked the poke of any of the XR Models and cost me £3 a week as he started washing it himself, I did hear when we moved away that his Super-duper Cortina was dogged with problem after problem, not surprisingly soon after the warranty period had elapsed and he went back to a Saab 99 and a Ford Fiesta XR3 for his wife.
Not unusual for cars to still exist due to being fitted with an immobiliser.
Why is this pillock faffing the throttle about on a carb with empty bowls while you crank... tell this idiot to hold it open slightly, that's it.... edit: then when he gets it started he sends a motor thats been sitting for 20 years to the moon.   If you've ever torn down a motor and wondered why it looked so much worse than another of the same type it's because of dinguses like this.
wow what a barn find i remember that well it was out at the right time but nobody really took to it they went for the granda saloon mostly the ghia model lol 😄
The barn find episodes have become my favourites. Good work late brakers!
You should connect up with AskEd and get him to restore this amazing car
this mofo loves his own voice. more car action and less talk ffs
Here in Australia the front end is xd Ford falcon
Not near as rare as the American Granada with the factory conversion into a Ranchero.I think you would call it a ute?
Had one as a company car in the seventies in Dorada motor group. Came  from  Huddesfield Ford, part of Dorada. Wonderful vehicle. Reg Smith.
Fantastic doesn't come close....
A year has gone and I'm sure this has found a new 'Caretaker'.I'd never heard of this,being from 'The States'.What a wonderful auto and so well kept.50K was in Kilometers and not Miles?Regardless of either,it will be driven again as intended,I hope,and not just brought out for shows.Thank you all for this trip into history.
My dad Had a 2.8i Ghia x pack in midnight blue with the softest velour interior, loved it. One thing that sticks out is the doors were insanely heavy.
Funny how people put a lot of emm & umm into their banter. Why is this.
Ford never built a decent large car after the Mk II Granada - what a glorious find....
My father had a red Granada Coupé from 1972. What a wonderful car that was!
Straight back to my misspent youth, I was 15 in 1980 living in Port Elizabeth South Africa. I love the old Cortinas and Granadas, especially the 3l  engine and two tone paint work on the Granada
Hi Guys, re. the Granada, not sure if anyone has mentioned this but Robert Plant, yes he of Led Zeppelin, had one. He lived not far from me. At the time I  worked at a local Ford  dealer/Shell garage in Chepstow and he would fill up regularly. I can remember photo coping his Visa slip just for the Autograph. Keep Them coming J.
I had a saloon 2.8 ghia back in 1985 gold with a beige interior, what a beautiful car that was, good luck to the new owner I'm totally jealous.
The UK Granada is way cooler than the US model was.
Fantastic car,love it,would love to buy it too!
The Germans certainly know how to design engineer and produce nice vehicles.
Once upon a time, there was a young couple named Jack and Emily who had a shared passion for adventure and exploration. They decided to embark on a journey throughout Europe in their trusty Citroen DS. Their goal was to experience the diverse cultures, landscapes, and cuisines of the different countries they visited.  They began their journey in Paris, the city of love, and drove through the winding roads of the French countryside, taking in the stunning views of vineyards and chateaus. They then continued through the Swiss Alps, where they enjoyed the snow-capped peaks and the fresh mountain air.  However, their journey was not without its challenges. Six times they found themselves stranded on the side of the road due to a broken fuel gauge in their Citroen DS. Each time, they had to wait for a tow truck to take them to the nearest garage for repairs. Despite the setbacks, they remained determined to continue their journey.  During one of their breakdowns, they were waiting for the tow truck when they decided to watch the latest car news on YouTube. They learned about the latest advancements in electric cars and wondered if they should consider upgrading their Citroen DS for a more modern vehicle.  As they continued their journey through Europe, they visited iconic cities such as Rome, Barcelona, and Amsterdam. They indulged in local cuisine, visited museums and landmarks, and met interesting people along the way. They even found themselves camping in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by breathtaking scenery and a sky full of stars.  Despite the challenges they faced, Jack and Emily realized that the journey was more important than the destination. They were creating memories that would last a lifetime, and their love for each other and their passion for adventure only grew stronger.  As they crossed the border back into France, they felt a sense of accomplishment for completing their European adventure. They returned home with a greater appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the world and a deeper connection to each other.  And even though they encountered some setbacks along the way, they wouldn't have had it any other way.
I remember a guy I knew in the 80's, his girlfriend's dad owned one, and a house to go with it , and I thought wow, they must be loaded!!
Only 500 were made
My dad had a 2.3 Ghia estate in Silver, it was immaculate. Purchased from a family friend who had it from new and cherished it.  Gave many years of great service. Semi frequent 1600 mile trips to Germany in extreme comfort.   I always though it was a very elegant car.
Sweet sweet car
Back in the early 80s next door n neighbor, had one I knew as soon as you opened up the garage door you have them little matchstick men on the rear tailgate
What a classic, definitely remember these. Initially thought it was going to be a 3.0 Ghia Coupe!
I remember my Dad having an 1979 ex police 2.8i Granada that we drove to spain in and the caretaker at my primary school had a Granada Chasseur. It seemed massive at the time, but is probably a piece smaller than my 2017 passat estate!
Fantastic
Close to Dagenham's lowest ebb
I remember my stepdad renting a granada back in 1983.  We went on holiday to my aunties in Suffolk and he loaded the boot with a ton of rockery stone plus our luggage with me on the back seat and drove the 310 miles in a right hurry. He always sat at 90mph on the m6.  If we had had an accident it would have been so ugly with half a quarry in the back with me.  Scary to think about now.
Great car Johnny. Never had Granada's in Australia. We had Falcon's insted.
Jonny what you need is a spray can of start you, bastard
When you washed it I let out a little bit of wee......what a stunning car!!! Cowley from the Professionals would have had one of these when he retired!!!
Please tell us you bought this from Lyn? That is a beautiful estate inside and out. We never got this in the US.
Love these kind of episodes 👏👏great work!
Remember them. I use to work at a dealership 40yrs ago
My favourite channel, totally original content and a genuine person who you'd be happy to chat with all day.
Hi, love your show, I would like to ask? how was the car sold in Germany? was it could the "Ford Taunus", its been bugging me for years. John, Germany.
Go on Johnny buy it. You know you want to. You’d do the right thing by it as well
What a car! I wonder what happened to it after the video? A year on and it doesn't have a fresh MOT yet.
Great video Johnny keep them coming, with it being so rare got to be worth £20-30K
Enjoyed!  The drive tec battery wasn’t the best start…..
Shame the mindless banger racing vandals favour these and p5s
My eldest brother used drive these old tanks, so comfortable and easy to drive for such a big car. Shame he never kept any of them!
What a beauty! I haven't seen any Granada since I left South Africa 21 years ago. Brings back so many memories!
Is there an update page anywhere?? I’d love to know what happened to the cars that are found .
Soooo? DID YOU BUY IT?
couldnt remember the chasseur until you said it but remembered the Olympic badge
What a bobby dazzler of an episode !
A beautiful car in its day ,still a beautiful car now ..
Is it just me but seeing jonny, a TV presenter, washing a car that isnt his, just to restore some old glory, is a magical thing.  No airs & graces, just washing a car...
Wow this brings back memories. My dad used to have one of these too. Not this exact model. But very similar. In a sort of champagne gold colour with brown cloth interior and those same wheels. Even hearing those boot struts open. That sound takes me back to my childhood and going fishing with my dad. And yup my dad's tailgate never stayed up either lol. One thing I could never work out is why the estate version was called the granada. But the saloon version was the cortina but they looked exactly the same apart from the extra boot space
Excellent video, wanted one when I was a kid and still want one now😢
Thats when they made proper estate cars
Classic Patrick Allen voiceover for the ad 😎
Had light blue metallic 2.3 V6 like the one in the old commercial. Nice, but slow. 108hp.
Absolutely fantastic
Shutting the tailgate gave a lovely ring for an old car
When I was 32 I owned the Ford Granada Consul 2.3 V6 manual 4 speed. The best car I ever owned (Peugeot 205 1.9 Gti were on second place😉🙂). I also had mk2 Granada 3 doors with 1.7 litre.  Good work sir, good work endeed 👏 👍
I thought you were going to say it was the fastback version like MY dad had in about the same blue as your dads at the start but this was really interesting and rarer obviously 👍🖖👏🤙🏻
Lovely Granny. I had 2.8 GL saloon face-lift, best car I ever had. Would love a Chasseur. Great show, thank you.
Lovely car om surprised he didn't buy it himself straight away, only 500 of them and that interior is chefs kiss
I worked at a Ford dealership from 1977 to 1983 , and I do remember the Granada Chasseur , I never understood what that decal was all about.  If the car has air conditioning then it would be operated by they blower switch, which had the fan speeds 0 1 2 3 , if it had air conditioning then if you turned the knob anti clockwise and you had the fan speeds for the air conditioning. They would have had rear bumper overrides, you can see that they have been removed.
Somewhere between 1988-92, a college friend of mine had a silver Granada 2.8I saloon. We'd  left college and she gave me a ride. I was amazed that this was her car 🤩😍.  It was so nice inside. She appreciated what car she was driving, it had wheels like this but in silver and a rubber boot spoiler. I loved Granada's and Capri''s. They had such a distinctive engine note and would always turn my head when they drove passed.  I last saw one a few years back and took a picture. When I find the picture, I'll send it to you Jonny. Your channel randomly came up on my feed (coincidently after watching you in some 9-10 year old editions of 5th Gear) on tv). I love your channel ❤️.
Great video. I love it when they fire up. Doing all your engine fiddling reminds me of those mornings after rain when no cars would start haha. Different world now
GRANADA mk1 & mk2 Station Wagon😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Had a Mk 4 Cortina Crusader in the same colour scheme, a brilliant salesman persuaded me not t finance a cavalier that was too expensive for me, he took me through to the back of the garage to show me the crusader, loved it immediately, I still dream that I find it in an abandoned council garage 😁
Such awesome cars, both the mk1 and mk2. My father had an early mk2 "2door" with the 2.3 petrol, i  learned on it to drive. It was a huuuge car, and then it got no power steering, so it took a few days to build some muscle and get used to it 😀 That was many many years ago, but ever since i want to get my hands on one again
You cant kill a Grannie , I knew it would go when you asked it ..Great motors..Now find a Mk1 " Sweeney "..
I can remember granada consuls in the 70s and 80s ,I loved the 2.8 ghia this brought back  great memories, 👍
That was one of the best episodes ever 👍
My Dad had a Mk1 fastback Ghia 3.0 in red with a black vinyl roof, it was gorgeous, registration LEE100P (which I understand is on a Land Rover). I had a Mk2 2.3 in red, but only an L trim, so not as nice as my Dads. I have had a few cars since then including Lexus and my current Mercedes S class, but none of them have had as good a ride as either Granada.
Nice find. What a cracking Granada. Pouring so much fuel in and pumping the carb too probably did no favours.
Not really barns are they.
These models in automatic had the C3 auto box fitted. If it won't go backwards when cold then the high & reverse servo seals have gone hard. I overhauled several of these back in the day with most of them just requiring a new set of internal "O" ring seals and gaskets. Happy day's!
As a former Ford trained technician going back to early 1972 up until March 1985 I can remember these special edition estate cars being launched. The sports decals are extremely familiar! The somewhat gaudy chequered interior was always a bit of a turn-off for me. The chunky treaded TRX tyres were standard fitment for all Granada's of the period with this spec of alloy wheels. This monologue really is a trip down memory lane for me!
That noise was a flashback to my childhood! The joy of it finally starting was always accompanied with a cheer by everyone in the car.   Love the channel guys keep up the good work.
Looks lovely
Nice car! My friends farther has died and has an old granada left in the garage.its a 2.8 v6.been in there for years, needs saving.!! Apparently it's in mint condition,  1 owner car.😍
I knew it was a chasseur as soon as I saw it was brown.  I remember them well.
My uncle had one of these back in the eighties always felt special cruising around in it seeing this vid bought back so many memories
There was only 500 produced worldwide so if there are any left they are super rare. I have had Granada’s in the past a pronominal car.😊
U come with a scooter battery to a 2.8 l engine?😂 And put some proper pants on your mechanic friend
i would love john buy it and give it a good home for my year and let him enjoy it to
Hi Johnny i used to work on these as an apprentice and remember them well as soon as i saw the tailgate i new it was a chassuer and that was 40 plus years ago in weston super mare
Granadas are going for strong money at the moment.
Loved this episode. I used to walk past Ford dealer Gilbert Rice in Horsham, Sussex twice a day to and from school. I’d go in and collect the latest brochures and pour over them at home. I could tell you fascinating details about options lists and badges if you were willing to listen. My mum says they’re probably all still in the loft. My Dad had Cortinas for years and the biggest news for me when he got promoted was that it meant he got upgraded to a Granada. But only a 2.3 GL! Then one day he came home with a 2.8i Ghia and I was lost in ecstasy. I’m 55 now and live in NZ and pretty soon sadly I’ll be back in the UK cleaning out the loft. I’ll place 5 quid on me finding the original brochure for this Chasseur model.
A family near me had one in the 80s 90s used it as a work horse. It was called JOBBY. It was replaced by a 760 TD
I didn’t realise how rare these were, My woodwork teacher had one when I was at secondary school , then when I left school and went to serve my time at a local Joinery and Undertakers one of our customers had one who was a local builder called Bob.
I've loved the Granadas since my first (of 5) the Chasseur was always the one I wanted but they were always like hens teeth, practical wise they could fit a sofa in the boot (like the Volvos)
Eyup  Jonny just watched this about the Granada, remember pulling up behind one in 1981 on the RAC Rally in the forest i had a 2.8 Granada Estate . The guy was just getting out of it and I fell in love with it , he'd just got it the day before from a Ford dealer in Nottingham and it was stunning had all the trick bits on it even air conditioning which was a first for us . I said I would  get one one day but  never did, spent all my money on Rallying mk1 and mk2 escorts. Just started watching your series and you've made my week what with the mk1 mk2 and RX7 which I had then this Granada Happy  time's so keep the video's coming Jonny.  Thanks  Steve 👍👍
My dads mate had the Sierra j reg lasted him till 2009 old ford were all amazing
Absolutely beautiful gorgeous Granada. My ultimate favourite old feel good Fords. I remember being given the keys to one back in 1986 after work! A bright yellow 2.8 injection! Went like a rocket! Well done for waking up the Chasseur and I remember seeing these back in East London growing up. Fantastic video too 😊😊
The car you drove in the intro is left hand drive, that's a Ford Taurus from Germany, not a Granada
The blue Mk1 at the beginning is achingly desirable.
Wow. Looks nothing like the American Granada.
The rims are not tdx they are Michelin TRX ,My dad had two of these chassuers,both bought from Stormont Ford at Woolwich ferry, the second one an injection model which was later given to my brother who converted to 5 speed manual and then bought a 3 litre capri, so it was handed to me. I spent around a year getting it back on its toes and kept it for about six years,at the time it was fitted with Colway ditchfinders,which I promptly ditched, all you could get was Uniroyal or Avon's at £80 a corner back then! Michelin tdxe's in 390 size were unobtainable once the fad had died off. Many BMW and Granada owners ditched the TRX rims in favour of the standard 14" alloys.trx tyres were bastards to get off the rims too!
As an American, when I hear Ford Granada Im expecting to see a certain thing.  This is not that thing.
Stumbled across this on my feed. What a wonderful find! Not strange that I’ve never heard of this version Granada since I’m from the U.S. and imagine we never offered this version. Wish some of my finds were in as excellent condition as this one is. Love wagons… sorry, “Estate Cars,” have owned 5 Edsel Station Wagons. 3 ‘58 Villagers, 1 ‘58 Bermuda and 1 ‘59 Villager. Thank you for this barn find!
Teach your buddy how to buy pants.
1:10 “this was a big car…” 😆
Rare as these cars in this edition!, I have a 2.8 GL saloon (poverty spec) not a inch of rust anyway! Big old boats pull like a train !!
It would be nice to see the car go to someone who will also really look after it  the same. Well done guys for getting running and what a difference  good wash made 👏
The years fly by, seems two minutes since these beautiful cars were on the roads. Great episode 👍🏻
Intro car is the mirror image of the first car I drove as a learner, only Dads was a 2.5 Consul with the extra chrome trim
Absolutely brilliant episode this, some memories of my late father’s A registration  2.3GL estate in metallic blue, with a BT dash mounted car phone.
My frend dad had in the 80s . It was just a dog poo . Woo
I had a Granada 2.8 Ghia X-pack estate, and i would boast to my workmates it was a Merc with a Ford badge. They laughed at me, but they were f00ls.
I remember my late father buying chasseur sierra lovely car dad was always a Ford fan always had sierras
I don't understand why you never change the oil an oil filter  it's really simple 2 do
I wonder how many people got the "Intruder 2000" alarm joke?  Best system ever created. 😂😂😂😂
In my youth, I ran a Granada 2.0L ( Poverty spec.) TTO 3X. 1982.  That steering wheel has a boss that can be removed in moments with the key and can be replaced seamlessly.  NOT ONCE, did the Rozzers ever find my stash of 90s Resin 😂  Thank you Ford.
Great episode
Quick gander by Lyn at the progress at 21.55  😂
wow, hope you made an offer Jonny, what a stunning car and needs very little work done to make lovely, great video!
Adrian flux the worst insurance company in Britain
is this for sale or has it gone yet
Love them old Granadas
I really do love a classic ford. This granada is without doubt mega rare but at least its not extinct. I saw a brochure on the granada mk2 range and in the back was a special order saloon in taxi spec, which was below a base model fitted with a diesel (yes diesel in a mk2)  from the factory. Seemed to me it obviously wasn't at all popular as not only having a gutless engine plus being special order it probably cost more for far less.
I remember the chicken chasseur
Beautiful ford
Beautiful content, cannot believe I have only just found this channel, truly brilliant stuff.
I've owned a Granada in Spain , in 2001 , broke up and abandoned in El Campello , Alicante ,right next to Lidl ,  Same year , owned just for a couple of days !!!
Loved this, watched every second! Brilliant
Somebody may have said this already but that car doesn't have air con. If it did, the fan selector would have 3 additional settings, which I think were usually marked in green.
not a fan of the colour but DAMMMMN that a Holy Grail mkII Granada, just keep it away from a banger racer
What a lovely video, story of a chap, family and the car that was a family member. You both treated it with the respect & care it deserved and what a truly lovely touch at the end of the video, showing Gerald. I'm not ashamed to say it brought a lump to my throat. Thankyou. To sum up, cars & people stories are always interesting, no matter what car, it's the people 'driving' it!
My dad sometimes came home in a mk 1 3 litre ghia coupe in yellow .I loved it and managed to own a j reg 2.8 which i traded in for a f reg xr2 .Happy days. Great video Jonny may there be many more hidden gems to video.
Lucky to find one which hasn't been banger raced
I didn’t like this vid, no, I LOVED it! What an absolute joy to see a lovely old granny being brought back to life 🥰
Amazing, my elderly father puts wood under the car like that in the garage. Nice find 👍
Old guy be up there smiling. Knew she’d fire up lol 😂 buy it Jonnie
Super video fab car keep up the good work My uncle had a grandad estate in 1979 In silver and black.
My dad was a rep and went from mk1 l gl mk 2 gjhia ghia x
These 'special edition' Fords would usually come out as the current shape of a model was about to be ended.
The moment we bring these back to life…🥲
My Dad worked at Fords Halewood…& every year he’d bring Fords Full Brochure…Fiesta Escorts Orion Cortina Sierra Saphire’s Capris & Last but not least…Granada…the best being the 2.8i Ghia X full leather top spec…loved the old Granada 3.0 & Coupe Granada…Fords brilliant 🤩
The worlds brownest Granada... lol I do like the black trim tho' 👍  My Dad refused to buy a very very cheap Jaguar once because it had metric wheels....
I took my driving test in my dads 3.0l Granada estate in 1978 after learning in a 1.0l mazda,bit of a difference !! wish I still had it now, happy memories of   ROO 857 M  powder blue
My dad had a white 2.8 GL estate auto on a V reg. Had Cibie Oscars on it until my brother nabbed them for his mk1 Mexico!!
I remember that model, what a find. I had several Granadas and I’m pretty sure the air conditioned ones had red and green heater control instead of red and blue so that probably doesn’t have it.
That interior is gorgeous.
Pretty much the same front end styling of an Aussie XD Falcon from the same era. We got the odd Granada in NZ. I remember the first time one came through the workshop and I couldn't work out which bit was MkIV Cortina, which bit was Capri and which bit was XD Falcon. Awesome memories. Cheers 🙏🙏👌👌
lovely episode. Thank you
O
I wonder how many great perfect 40 year-old engines have been completely f......ed up after some plant have tried to start them up without an oil flush and change and a new oil filter at the minimum. Amateurs would be a compliment.  Nothing like revving the balls on it  after the first start ....I'm sure the bearings appreciated that
I used 2 work in the bodyshop at ubm Ford in winchester 89/90 n I've never seen one of these ,the parts fella where I worked hadda mk 2 granny I think it was a 2.8 ghia x estate I remember bk then it was huge he hadda pair of mk2 rs2000s he used 2 rally never knew whatever happened 2 him I hadda mk3 capri 2 tone silver I always thought that was a chasseur??crackin video jonny 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I had a 74 Ghia coupe, gold color, what a great old car
Lovely sound…….drowned out by effing music………why !!!
Not a 100% sure but I think princess Ann had one of these ! Fantastic car bring back great memories..
Epic! Buzzing for this!
Oh wow what a machine always liked the granada im sure there was a cortina version as I remember my dad's friend had a cortina estate same color 2 tone jonny you need to buy her use her for shows 👍
I love what your doing on this channel Johnny, uncovering cars that were arguably a bit naff shouldn’t be interesting but they were special to the person that owned and loved them and that’s what makes it great.  It’s romantic and quite emotive especially when it was the family car. I really enjoy watching these mate, please keep em coming 👍
Great to see l I remember my father had same coloured 1976 estate .love Granadas
Well done, you managed to get much further with the Ford Granada than with many other of your Barn finds.  It's a pity that you aren't really able to take some of your finds out for a wee drive but obviously I understand things like road tax, insurance means that you are very limited to what you can do in one day.
Yes I remember the chasseur plus I collect old car brochures and somewhere I have the Ford cars brochure advertising the chasseur somewhere
Excellent 👍 👍
Sure they that grands chasseur in green as well , there was one in Sheffield as a kid it was the owners of pine grove country club  it had white alloys as well estate with the orange Olympic badge on
Ripper of a find , but did zome body nick the rear underiderz
Cannot believe how the front end looks like a mark 3 escort with those thin bumpers
Cracking vid. If you hanker after something that you always wanted or brings back happy memories then do it before it is too late.
I was on an Apprenticeship with WHPerrys 1978- 84 and I carried out psi,s on a couple of Granada estates ,I would have signed the service book,Dave Collyer!
Its delightfull to watch it being washed,makes the show complete!
I always like the 2.8 injection sport
The condition of that was pretty damn exceptional for a simple garage storage. The interior was absolutely mint.
Like 👍
I hope you buy it
An Australian Ford Falcon XD. Fitted here with a 4.1 six or a V8...
I’m feeling inter generational nostalgia :)
I must be getting soft - old machinery that was cherished by an owner no longer around, firing up with a little coaxing; rarely a dry eye. It’s what keeps me in preservation.
Is it for sale  ? Contact details ?
In Australia we had the "superior" XD-XE Ford Falcon/Fairmont, with free Australian Design Award window decals, it shared the same looking headlights and grill as on the Granada and possibly some other bits. No over complicated and fragile independent rear end, headlight washers? fugly tail lights, Chathams, Cologne V6s, Peugeot Diesels, VAT and Granada badges  ;-).  No Olympic Chasseur Edition, however we did have some specials, the ESP - European Sports Pack - Option 54.  ESP and other models could be ordered with a 5.8(351) Cleveland V8 a smaller 302(4.9) V8 and some straight sixes(4.1, 3.3) such as the 250 crossflow.  The ultimate pick for some of us XD/XE Ford hoarders in Terra Nullus would be the Fairmont Ghia ESP with the 5.8 Manual, option 54'd with the Scheel seats. As for wagons.. Sundowner?   Enjoyed the show, thumbs up.
Gem. Enjoyed this episode
BUY IT Jonny
I remember seeing these around in the early 1980s and even then the colour to my eye looked old fashioned, something from the previous decade the 1970s. I could never understand the Chassauer name or the sporting decals. It just never seemed to make any sense perhaps that's why Ford did not sell that many of them at the time.
Not started for 8-9 years…. Revs it straight up over and over and over🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ That hurt to watch
I always thought these models were known as the ‘Sportsman’….. serviced a few as an apprentice at Ford dealership in Folkestone back in the early/mid 80’s.. so I now know they are a ‘Chassure’ model, still learning about Fords in my mid 50’s 🤣
I can’t remember the year model but my Sister had a Mercury version of the Granada that was a 2 door with a 302 under the hood backed by a C4 that I tried to buy off her but she traded it. I thought it would have made a great sleeper and wish I could find one like it to this day.
I had the common booted Ghia X version back in the day but it had a 5 speed manual box, At the age of 22 I didn't want an automatic, it took me a couple of months until I found a second hand one. I also remember having to change the gearbox on mine, second hand box from a Capri, £50 or £60 I gave a friend of a friend for that,.. those were the days, can't get much for that money now.
Johnny get a can of starter spray containing ether. I use it for starting pretty much everything that's been idle for some time.
My uncle had a Granada in about 1986. I think it was a Ghia and an unusual purple colour. Was very quiet from memory. The Granada was the Euro cousin of the Ford falcon but with a nicer interior.
Treated this with care and compassion, very respectful johnny 👍
That boot is huge 👍
Friend of mine owns one of two Turbo Technics Granadas... so there
Beautiful. And getting it out and back to life what a treat for the family. I hope it will be going to to good caretaker! Thank you 🙏
We had a 2.3 But the Aussies did it right by dropping  a V8 in them.
Love the Ford granada
Yes I remember the model... a thing of beauty indeed . I think I'm one of the few people who liked the two tone paint jobs ford did back then.  The Calypso and Express mk5 cortina's etc as well.
Just out of interest @thelatebrakeshow - do you ever do follow up episodes on any of your finds?  would love to know where the various motors ended up and ballpark value of sales (cos am a little bit nosey like that - who isn't tho eh!) ?
Just found your channel yesterday and when I saw the granada film I wet myself, I know I will have to get that looked at but absolutely brilliant video, one of the best I've seen in 2021...thank you.. I had a 1982 2.8 ghia x with a four speed manual.. I took my wife to hospital in it when her waters broke with our eldest son he's now 28..i just showed him and he loved it. More classic ford's. Please.... Have a great new year guys.. James.. Bristol
Jonny it's  been a month did you  buy it ? I do hope so, we all want you to as it will be properly looked after for the rest of its days......go on Jonny you know you want to it just makes perfect sense.
The 2012 Ford Mondeo estate has a big boot as well
Proper car, love Granadas
I lasted 25 seconds till the worst car reviewer - ever, started talking.
Looks like a xd ford falcon from Australia
i drive a 1999 728i .mint but id have a granada in sky blue  in exchange.
tax mot exempt and worth £10 000
Awesome car  Have always loved Granada's but have never seen or heard of the Chasseur
Should be put out of its misery. I own a scrapyard and will put it in my crusher for free mate if you contact me. It would be the best place for it. What an eyesore typical Ford disaster. 😂😂
Is this the great great grandfather of the Mondeo Estate?
No way, proper gutted you looked at a square Granada after teasing us with a round one. Im offski!!
I found a tractor in the barn. With blown cylinders 😂
I so want, no need this interior for my orange-red '73 Consul! 😍
I had one of these. I bought it from a dealer in Portobello, Edinburgh in September 1988. I was 20 years old. I think I paid £1500 for it. I traded it for a Capri 2.8i in July 1989. I worked in a tyre dealers when I owned it and the tyres were £150 each which was more than my weekly take home pay and only available from Avon and Michelin. I'm sure the tyre size were 200/55VR390. The wheels look the same as the Granada Ghia's of the time but Ghia's where 14" in diameter making them over an inch smaller than on my car. The wheels are large for the time as most cars had 13" or 14" wheels (a mini wheel was only 10") so the wheels on this made the car look beefy. I also remember the log book stating the the model box "Granada GLS". Also if I remember correctly, it is possible to remove all the luggage. Two are belted in and two slide up and out I think?
I was an apprentice mechanic in Aberdeen in the 80’s and remember one of these coming in.
The memories 80s  cars and caravanning flood back , simply Wonderful yes and with my ford escort cabriolet magic car sold it in 2015 big big mistake 🤕
12:13 "Look at the paintwork underneath...". How am I supposed to look at it if you don't show it... Poor camera work... This Spec of Granada is beautiful thou 👏👏 You have left us with some deficiency, hunger and disappointment. As you did not display the car good enough. I hope you plan to do the next episode about that beauty...
This would be a fantastic Late Brake Show flagship vehicle!
Worked on loads of Grannys my era has a mechanic thankfully. Nice and simple. Those Pierburg carbs that Ford used back then were rubbish. Although a decent engine the 2.8 could never match the burble of the old Essex V6
In 30 years’ time, when somebody is trying to get an old Prius going, it just won’t be the same…
is this in Devon ? .....looks like its round the corner from me ........great find
Belongs in a museum in my humble opinion. Perhaps Ford UK would be interested ?
What a great car  My dad had a Mk4 Cortina Gia in Roman bronze with a tan vinyl roof which was the first car I ever drove. This gorgeous Granada looks like it could be re commissioned relatively easily. I wonder if Ford have one of these in their collection?
Incredible how much character older vehicles had.
Are they the same wheels as a Consort?
Great way to treat a classic, start it up with seized piston rings and then spray water all over it!
Great memories .. I still miss my W reg Granada 2.8i Ghia S .. 4 speed manual box too
When I was a kid, i went on holiday to Italy in a Cortina estate. My dad decided to drive all the way with 6 people in the car. My brother and me went the whole way in the boot and we had hold luggage on the roof.
My sister has a mk1 Granada 2.0GL with 36k on it and her fella had numerous Granadas, the last two both being Mk2 Series 2 2.8i Ghia X's in Caspian Blue (1 saloon, 1 Estate). All 3 of us absolutely love Granadas.
So how much ? ..
Kick down ! ...we didn't need turbo's in those days
Now strip it out, number board on the roof, rad in the boot....bomb it round the track 👌
I had a schoolfriend in the 80s who's dad had a granada estate in that colour. I'm now thinking it was a chasseur. Don't know how many were built but I'm still in contact with her on fb so I might see if she's got any info. Nice car that on the video
Mate your belt is meant to hold up your trousers
Hi there, it’s New Year’s Day ,2022.  0700hrs. Am unwell laid in my bed ,my beautiful wife fast asleep next to me.  On YouTube for the past hour or so. Noticed your site for the 1st time. Two bubble car finds.   have subscribed to your most wonderful site. After feeling low at 69 years old  I look forward to watching all of your finds !!. Thank you so  much for lifting my spirits .   PS : Happy new year to you.
Brilliant stuff what a achievement for a old Ford 🚘👍.
Back in the days ford built deasent cars unlike the shite they build today great cars them
For heavens sake don’t let the banger boys get hold of this old girl!
Was offered a "chasseur" in early 2000....didn't buy it as I was after my mate's "executive" saloon.....never managed to get that either..🤔. 😭..!!
I was a apprentice car repairer when I was 16 and these were the cars I used to get excited about mk1 escorts etc brings back happy memories thanks for sharing
Hope you bought it. And if not, whoever buys it cares for it, keeps it original and let’s you do another film on what they did to fix it up.
What a stunningly beautiful car,immaculate interior.  I worked for a Ford main dealer when the standard Granada,s were about. They were lovely cars then. I would have this Granada over any of today's so call cars. Really enjoyed this video. 👌
Take me back to the eighties...I'll be good and go to school I promise
Pull his trousers up Jonny. 🤣
When i was on my  apprenticeship in the early 70s with a Ford main dealer, is when the Mk1 Granada first came out, prefered that to the Mk2, great to see another classic car come back to life, great video again
This is only UK production car, it was not made in Germany. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TygW0EydlE The 2door on the other hand was produced only in Germany. Bit of UK/DE Granada production differences.
It's easily forgotten that Ford made some seriously good cars. The Granada was certainly one of them.
these cars are more than cars...they have soul, its great to watch them come back from the dead
These are great shows....great Granada and obviously Gerald's pride and joy. Hope it goes to someone who will cherish it like he did.
So much better than Top Gear etc.. Thanks.
Great , get it bought Jonny
Brilliant episode, as I love these old Grenada's 😁💙👍
this is magic
What an incredible time capsule of a car. I especially love the fitted luggage.  I was well chuffed when you got it going, and it sounded so smooth, which I suppose is to be expected with only 50k on the clock.  It's barely run in.
What’s it worth as it??????
A black exterior trim pack is common now, must have been very rare in the 1980s. Love it.
Buy it, buy it !
Hi, My Dad had a Granada Estate. He used it for his business. He supplied confectionery to shops all around Dublin in Ireland. I am now 67 yrs, in 1976 my abiding memory was my dad gave me and my fiance the car to go and collect an old double bed , from my fiance’s Uncle , for our new house. The car was huge we got the whole bed into the car having collected it in Dundalk , which was about 2 hours drive north of Dublin. We are married 44 years now and the memory is still with me. Great video thanks.🇮🇪☘️ Have a great Christmas.
wow   what a  great  Story  Behind this Granny  Thank you  So Much  guys  For the Video
A real credit to the original owner - RIP.
What a truly fantastic video, the passion and editing is above everyone else. Love your passion Jonny and I'm sure the owner would have been proud to see this.
Please If possible Jonny buy this one it needs some one like you to be the custodian of this car for a few more years.
There was a guy that stayed near me who was a sales manager for a dealership, he came home with one the exact same as this , I’ve told people about it & everyone looks at me as if I was mad. Brown car with the sports figures on the rear 1/4 panel . Thank you for proving I was right.
You should buy it Johnny...you won't get one as in a good a condition as this car especially with the low mileage !👍
The kindling underneath should be enough to get it going
Well, if they were good enough for the Sweeny……..
Awesome 👍🏻👍🏻!!
hi back in the 80s we had xd and xe falcons in Australia mostly 4 litre sixes with the 351 v8 engined beast also i had the xd with the 4 litre engine there was also the 302 engine as well regards from Australia PS  I noticed you had fire place going it was 35 c in Newcastle today cheers
Banging the leather off the ground is smart
i think the most fun i have had in a car was a mk3 granada h plate i bought for £450 about 15 years ago.used to get slagged for owning a grandad car but this was just rapid rear wheel drive 2l dohc the most fun and for some reason cheapish on the fuel and insurance.dead comfy with half leather.the only downpoint was it was a flintstone car that the floor was really rotten which was a shame
What a beautiful find.
I have some original photos taken by Ford internally in their studio of the Granada Chasseur.
Buy it and road trip
Amazing find it should go to ford heritage museum it’s a time capsule.
The mileage of 49,999 has been on every MOT since 2006
My wife worked for a large building company in Kent and she won two tickets for the first day at the Chelsea flower show. They said you can't use your own car as it wasn't posh enough and gave us a brand new Granada Chasseur to use for the day. That car could really motor up hills. I always remember the decals on the car, I thought they looked awful and couldn't see the point of them..
Buy it!! Did you buy it? My dad had a white Granada 2.3 GL, DPP331T
Awesome old beast
This is what I love about the car culture and preservation instinct in England. The car was bought for a specific purpose. Knowing it would probably be banger raced when they could no longer use it, they kept it tucked away. Now it can be kept for good instead of just being another lost car. This was a wonderful video, the cheeky drove shot was fun too 👍
I'm sure they did a chasseur Sierra or cortina too!! If I'm not mistaken
not wood veneer dash, just plain old plastic.
Buy it Johnny. It's lush. - I had a neighbour in Northern Ireland who had a Paris Blue metallic 2.8i Ghia X back in the day. I got to ride in it a few times and I loved it. I always liked the shape of the MK2. They were very popular with the RUC too, but theirs were armoured.
I'm in america nd I love these resurrections! I've done a few in my day but this one really got my attention and feeling a bit emotional...lol I love it ,please do a follow up.
Great show.. but can you stop saying gosh so much..😂😂
thinking about it it could of been a 2.8 or 3 ltr
my grandad had a two door coupe granada   it think it was the consel(if that's how you spell it) it was white with a black vinyl roof... cant remember what engine size but it was over 2ltr..
Pretty much the most limited special edition ford ever made and it isn't even domestic to the states. What a miraculous find. So sweet!
I don't understand why it wouldn't start in neutral but did in park.
Anyone also remember the Granada Coupe? Fella near me had one. Rare even then new.
Ford used to use them as service barges for their rally Escort team in the late 1970s. Huge estates.
I used to ride in a gold 2.8 Ghia X auto to school, was so comfortable in the back I fell asleep most days! It's only as an adult you realise what a machine it was!
As a man who loves my ford's even I never knew these existed. Well done Jonny and Dave for pulling it out and getting her started. The build up to starting the car and the editing made the video enjoyable to watch.
Who would think that in this awful age of SUV everything that even today 40 plus years on, the big wafty estate and saloon lives on in some form or other. Keep the faith you driving glove wearing kings and queens of the road 😎
Time travel IS real! Ooh all that 80’s brown and beige. And squareness 😍Chassuer???!! It was preceded by ‘chicken’ when I was at school during the same period. I suppose it sounded French and exotic to Essex Man🧐
Remember seeing a Granada one with gold writing on it as I belonged to a local Granadas owners club in Thanet , I also had a left hand drive one with Munro air shock absorbers.
My Dad had a Granada estate Ghia in the mid eighties. Lovely car, it had all the 'mod cons'. Bloomin fast, but very comfortable to be in. One of the few cars Dad had that he was sad to see it go. Nice one!
What a stunning piece of 1980's motoring history. Echos of the interior of my MK1 Fiesta Supersport (without the leather) with the check. I loved the Granada back then, but by the time I could drive, they were too expensive! You have to buy it!!   Great video, and my condolences to the family of the owner. But what a fantastic job he did keeping it in such great condition. 👍🏻
Had one of these back in the 90s
Took me back to my school days because the headteacher drove a saloon Granada &:they were common among the parents who insisted on doing the school run before it was fashionable. Also had a classmate whose dad worked at Ford Halewood and drove a racing green Capri Mk3 280 Koln. Amazing car, tan leather interior.
Definitely buy it Jonny, what a great Car. I saw one a few years ago in Broadstairs where I live. I remember the Sports decals on it. 'Share in Ford's success' as they used to say!!!
👍🏾
Brilliant watch being in my 50s really enjoyed this far happier times. 👍🏻
I had a couple of Granada estates. On one particularly cold night I couldn't be bothered to drop the rear seats and seriously regretted it after my girlfriend poked 2 holes in the roof lining with her stiletto's.  practical? Oh yes.  The same car took me and a mate to Holland with all our necessities for a week long fishing trip with room to spare
As much as i love Granadas (owned 4) estates never done it for me
Ford Granada...the best car Ford ever made....I feel bad  I used about 30 of them, mk1 and mk2 limos included, banger racing in the 90’s and early 2000’s..
I served my time as a Ford Technician in late 70’s to early 80’s and I can remember at least one of these being sold and maintained by S Jennings Ltd Main Ford Dealer based in Morpeth Northumberland. Unusual and highly specked car, had totally forgot they even existed, Ford did quite a few specials back then, happy memories
I loved my Granada from -76. Buildt ny daimler..... lost in history.
Oh you need to buy it!!!!  Cool to see the strong influences / foundation this car provided for the Australian Ford Falcon of the 80’s.
I suspect the odometer may be broken as the last 6 MOTs going back to 2006 show the mileage as 49,999...
Big car differs from the UK to US a big car in the US Is Ford F-150
love it
I knew a plasterer in Bradford had one about 30 years ago I think the man's name was Jack ,
Great  collector car...
It goes to show that cars are more than they seem. But this is truly a remarkable find. You will never get a better example than this. Great video and tastefully done...I bet the family are proud! 👍🏻
Like Estate Cars, So Usefull and the Style Of Them Is Cool, Specially older Squarer Ones. Not a model i'd heard of, Really Cool
Took me back nearly 40 years, first car was a metallic brown mark III cortina, did you buy the Granada??
How could you not buy this car! Thanks, great episode.
Grand Granada !!!
Rare= nobody bought any 😄
I remember working on the Granada during my time at a ford main dealer 1976 to 1983. k Jet Bosch fuel injection system . It had a plastic main timing gear that would shear. Also had a problem with the axle pinion knock . If I remember it,was a C3 transmission
Much more stylish than the American Granada.
When you said a rare Granada I probably haven’t seen before I’ll be honest I thought it would be the dually pick-up one that’s on air built back in the 90’s. Apparently it’s outside a museum somewhere. That’s an idea actually. A series where you go and look at the cool cars left out to pasture sitting behind or outside museums, sweet & sour lowrider has a similar fate outside a museum rotting away.
The MOT history on this is pretty strange to be honest 🤔
New to your channel today. :-) :-) I worked on these from new in the Cambridge area. I thought the driving lamps were standard too but maybe not. I also thought there was an upgraded tailgate strut ( more powerfull ) to alleviate tailgate droop. It has been a while................ The 2.5 diesel turbo must also be pretty rare nowadays - that just  seemed to pull forever. AC control on the heater fan switch?? Just twist the other way? The stereo should have been a 5 push button radio cassette Ford unit? Roman Bronze was difficult to match as there were 16? different shades from the factory.
Please please buy the beast johnny. Someone will just treat this as a cash cow. We know that you will treasure this as we can see the twinkle in your eyes.
Love it. Looking at it from the front end it's reminiscent of our Aussie 1979 - 1982 XD Ford Falcon wagons.
We’ve got dash lights the mileage is 🤷‍♂️ pull your trousers up mate we didn’t have digital clocks back then 🙃
I knew of a British Granada in Perth Western Australia about 20 years ago. Was owned by a British fella who would import spares.  It had a small v6 when our Falcon at the time had a 4.1 litre straight 6 base model with couple of V 8 options.  But yeah loved the Granada.
You said I'm sure it has AC, after you got the hood open why didn't you have you camera man show the motor & then you could have told use forsure if it has AC or not? Then you said you can see the mouse dropping in the spare tire are, but your camera man is 10' away & I couldn't see anything
What a stunner. That interior is something else. Love it.
One of my favourite videos along with the similarly kept Volvo. Loving your work! What’s the music at ~28:30ish?
That's not a big car, it's just sitting in a small garage.
i have  had 3 Granadas including 1 ex police, i (very tame in comparison) saloon and a 2.8ix estate with the trx wheels always fancied a chasseur but never got one
its nice to see a proper classic getting a dose of daylight and not just slapped on a transit tow truck and bollocked for banger racing... 😖👍
Looks like Australian XD Ford falcon
What a fantastic find, I just wish someone could help me with my Fiat 126 air cooled convertible?
I have an 1981 Daily Mail Motor Show Guide . The Chasseur is not listed but the top spec Granada 2.8 Ghia is priced from £10,300. Similar cars listed are the 2.8 Vauxhall Royale at £10,500 and the Volvo 265GLE at £10,900. For some comparison the basic 1.1 Escort is £3500 and an XJ6 4.2 is from £16K. Thanks Johnny.
why would you even try to start it...before doing the service
It looks exactly like our old blue ford cortina estate we used to have back thn lol
The Prescott Motor Company I believe used to be in Kettering Northamptonshire
I got tears in my eyes lads ......... stunning what a car ,
Cars we had n my youth...Taunus, Granada's and Capri's ....
Starts with any old ford key
Sorry that’s not a Granada 😎
UBD Northamptonshire registration, my guess is supplied new by E Ward of Wellingborough
Werent they 390mm TRX RIMS??
Looks very similar to an 1981 Australian Ford Falcon XD station wagon
We had Granadas in the states, but I don't  think they were the same car. Much like we also had Cavaliers made by GM but they had nothing  at all to do with the Vauxhall model.
Our next door neighbour Don had one of these.. He drove his family to south of Spain every year in a gold version of this . Didn't think I would see another one.. cheers !! One thing I didn't like was the check pattern . Now I am older , I realize my tastes haven't changed. LoL 😁 banging good car though.. well done son ..
With prices as they are, a really expensive car.  Needs love but will go for another 40
XD FALCON in Australia. With a 5.8 litre  v8 Cleveland. Absolute beasts. A 4.9 v8 was available as well a a 4 litre 6 cylinder. Drove like boats but reliable as the sun every day.🇦🇺
Worked at E.Ward (Corby) Ltd Ford dealer, from 1971 for 25 yrs this brought back memories
OMG it reeks of XD falcon wagon.
Love the show only very sick people like Brown & Tartan 😀😀
4:58 Classic Ford "clang" when he shuts the tailgate. It was that noise that meant my Dad would never buy a Ford. He always said they were just a tin box on wheels.
I would be annoyed if someone left it to me in their will!
What a car! I've had about 10 Granada's and love them. I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
A most excellent find and revitalisation, chaps! 👌🏻
so what is it worth in its current condition
Bit of info, the company it was purchased from is STILL trading, and apart from adding the '1' to the telephone number on the cars number plate, it is the same contact number. My mate was the sales manager there, but after this car was registered.
I remember dad have one B911xys  2.8i Ghia, prince Charles & Diana had the same one but it was Ghia x  . I used to drive it after I past my test in 1990 👌
jonny , did this sell at all ,? let me know if not
Sounds gd
Nice ford🚗💖💖💘💖
I remember having a Granada in the same colour, I bought it for £250  it used more oil than petrol so I got shut petrol had just gone up too £1.99p a gallon . Mine was the saloon version, like the one they used in the Sweeney  in the T V series the flying squad. Great 👍 video
Great story telling. A good demonstration of the connections that are made between people and their cars, and their families. Genuine passion and joy throughout. This makes for a really great watch and I would love to hear what ultimately happens to the car ... even if you manage to resist buying it!
My dad had one CJG886W, was a cracking  car. There was an Escort equivalent,  called the Huntsman irc. Great watch, never thought  I would see one again.
My old man swore by these Granadas. He had a 3,000 xx ghia brand new  we went everywhere in that car.  Of course soon as I passed my test and went VW. But years later found my old man’s Granada for sale from the bloke who bought it from my dad.  So many happy memories
Gerald W Thomas died on his birthday, what an ironic day of event, so sad
Hearing a Brit refer to this as a "big car" absolutely tickles me
Brilliant I really hope we get an update on how it’s doing someday.
You asked for stories about the Granada, my friends grandfather owned a Ford dealership in the 70's 80's and 90's her mother used to have all sorts of Ford's. She had a chasseur both the Granada and the sierra versions.... I remember thinking how in Ford like the interior was..... Her grandfather had a Ghia  X  it was blue and silver with gray leather. I'm sure it was a special too??
What a joy to see such a rare car brought back into the light. I wouldn't say no to one myself!
What a find,  buy it
O my God not the estate with the tartan seats and picnic basket I tried googling it last year ! Could not find it
Why did you do all that cranking on dry cycliders and bearings?
I had a 2.8i Ghia x pack estate for a few months  what a lovely car it was. Picked it up at Brentford car auctions Had no trouble selling it on.
A true survivor car well worth re commissioning and used in the summer months to car shows and picknicks lol an awesome motor they don't make them like they used too.
A true survivor car well worth re commissioning and used in the summer months to car shows and picknicks lol an awesome motor they don't make them like they used too.
Great find and to see remember seeing the Granada Chasseur at our local Ford dealership when new just a thought its been stood for all those years and when it fires up you rev the nuts off it  Should have let it tick over for a while first
My dad had at least four Grannies. Two estates and two saloons all were 2.8 Ghia’s. Sadly one by one they were stolen. I love these old Fords.👍🏽 I’ve just subscribed to your channel.
Wow! Those adverts are awesome...lol
I'm glad that the "The Late Brake Show" realized that truly appreciating people and the cars in their lives is not "perverted".  It's just good stories about obsessively passionate people and their vehicles. Go Jonny!
If any car needed a national trust member sticker in the window   ...this is it.
I always enjoy The Late Brake show, but these episodes are top shelf! It's not easy to make this kind of content so interesting and enjoyable, but Jonny and the team always make it work! Kudos! :)
24:00 Why's your mate revving the knackers off a cold engine that probably hasn't run in years? Seems like a pretty stupid idea.
I was to young to remember this particular model but it looks a little to me like a Range Rover-esque Granada.
I remember there was this Granada estate brown with sport checked seats and those matchstick men doing the sports activities I only ever saw 1 knew it was rear eve n then coming home from school in the 80s it was definitely the only 1 in hackney
I won't lie "i need this in my life" i just need this!!!!!
Fantastic stuff!!
I was surprised to see you driving a left hand drive one. Did they build that for export?
It was nice to see your passion for one of my all time favourite cars. I have had many granadas, but my true love was my first mk2 Granada 2.3L, The sound and comfort. This is a beauty, and you need to buy this one, what a rare beauty.
I remember PDI a few of these in the early 80's while serving my apprenticeship at a ford dealership. it was always a treat to drive one  as they were well out of the price range of an 18year lad  Happy days
Never saw one here in the states. We're the built over here? Did they come out of Detroit?
My dad bought one from Laidlaw's Ford dealership in Edinburgh. Always remember the registration-ASC 407W. It was 1 of 500 built. I only ever saw another Chasseur in Edinburgh, and it belonged to a gentleman who lived outside Edinburgh in Loanhead. My dad eventually sold it about 2 or 3 years later. As it was an automatic, he did hit some black ice near our home and skidded, and put the car through a 7ft brick wall. It was in the repair shop for a few months, as they had problems sourcing the side "Olympic decals". Would still love to be able to buy one when I retire.
Easy start
Seems a bit odd that the previous 6 mot’s all state the mileage as 49999? Either trailered to the mot test centre or the odometer is stuck 🤔
Full independent suspension too, the wheels should be gold
A family friend had a chasseur with all the luggage. It was a nice motor. I had a face lifted mk2 ghia x executive.  The air con was activated with the blower switch. If you can only select three speeds it is non-air con. Unfortunately from your video I didn't get a clear view of the heater blower control.  27:27 moon roof, not sun roof...just saying.
One of these (but regular) estates near me and used on a regular basis, love them! Good find.
So Jonny did you buy it???
Old Ford's never ever die!!
Where’s it going up for sale?! I need this!
I remember these - the Ford dealer in Coatbridge (Laidlaws) had one. I had a right good look at it when I bought a Capri…I was sorely tempted. I think this is where my love affair with estates began now that I think about it. Brilliant find and great video 👍
If the internet didn't exist, people would still be buying stuff like this for £800 😜
I'm sorry I was wrong to tune in to a British car show, all your cars are small but so is your country so don't fret and they are made like junk except Bentley's and Rolls-Royce's.
You definitely need to buy it and bring it back to it's true original condition looking at it it won't take much a good load lugger for the family I had a mk 2 Granada saloon auto black vinyl roof and maroon beige cloth interior it was lovely wish I had kept that in a Lockup I no you would be good for the car
Used to walk past one of these on way to school in 1980 at Disley (near Stockport) as a young boy, he also used to have a "countryman" edition. There was also a mk4 cortina 2.0 sport with black around the rear reg plate.
My sister had one for the horse trailer. A 2.3l. I thought it would be a rather fast car, remembering my father's M20 2.3l. But that thing was slow... incredible.
Real beauty
A Granada was a  different car in N America it was a European style  that was advertised that it had a ride as good as as a Mercedes Benz. The Ford ads they had a blindfolded person ride in a Mercedes Benz and a Granada they were unable to tell the difference between the cars. I owned a 1976 Granada 2 door with a 5.0 V8 it had slightly better ride than my 1977 Mercury Comet (Ford Maverick with sunglasses on) they shared the same platform a slight improvement in suspension I thought a Chevy Nova was a better car that is a huge admission from a Ford guy. I would also go with a Plymouth 340 Duster  or 340 Dodge Demon RT over a Granada yes I’m a Chrysler guy.
Sold 3or 4 of these used back in the 80s ,they were sought after then ,I specialised in Ghia X's , executive's etc ,could never get enough of them . Nearly every video is the same on tube always ill prepared no boost pack ,cheapest crappy jump leads ,you were very lucky to get away with it .As a professional Do yourself a favour and spend some money on Quality kit you tight b*****d  ! ,
I spotted the Prescott motor company name on the number plates. Must be local to me in Burton Latimer Northants.
Was that blue smoke?
Love the Grannie Estates…and this one is super rare! Buy it Jonny or I’ll have to. 🤭
Your Miami blue granada is gorgeous! And that Chasseur estate is gorgeous, you’ve got 2 of my ultimate classic cars right there! The 1980 granada doesn’t require an MOT anymore and is entitled to free road tax!
These Granadas were handsome cars back in the day. Unfortunately, my only experience of one was when a friend lent me a Granada 3.0L saloon for a day, that he hadn't used in a while. I managed to do what I needed to, but returned the car reporting that although it seemed to drive ok, it only gave me 5 mpg!
Buggered It Now Aye, that E10 is now Eating it's Way Through it's Digestive System!!!
Need a can of "Start Ya Bastard". down the carby.
So much like a Ford Falcon made in Australia.
I was a Ford Mechanic in 1980 when this lovely edition Granada came out. I remember it as i was lucky enough to PDI a brand new one . I only remeber it being available in Estate version and with a non Injection V6 2.8 Colonge engine. The Granada was built in Germany and this was a period when  Ford brought many special edition cars out in the late 70's 80's to name some of the special Ford cars had edition names like  Linet,Harrier (Escorts). Olympic (2000E) Kingfisher,(Fiesta). I worked an all these cars . Happy days 😄
Anyone estimate how much is it's worth?
Love it, granada it's great cars, memories from i was a kid😃❤🇳🇴 Never own one but i will buy one some day😎
You can’t help but love the Granada’s of that era. The 6 cyl sounded amazing. I had a friend who had the face lifted Saloon 2.8. We loved it
Stunning work Johnny 🍻
Everyone loves Granny ❤️
What a stunning car. This was a real pleasure to watch. Well done.
Needs bangering
The most satisfying part of this video is hearing Jonny pronounce decal correctly ☺️👍
buy that man suspenders please
Great find. Trim colour is Peat. Appealing name.
Jonny give in to temptation. Life is very short and you would never get the chance to be the caretaker of such a unique vehicle again, it'll be a great match to tow the Allegro to races....
What an excellent episode. As good as anything on the TV. Makes everything else on here look really cr*p. And I like old fords. Keep up the good work.
Got your name all over it Johnny
Buy it Johnny
I loved the granada  of 70s and 80s .my brother had mk1 granada  coupes and mk2 is mate had m1 coupes  just great cars but thirsty
That, right there is a genuine Folvo.
Hi, great video. A little tip: Don't put the fuel filter behind the fuel pump, because they are not made for a high pressure. Especially if the get old an weak. Fuel filters have always to be before the fuel pump. Best regards Ralph
The fella on the Granada advert used to be on so many other adverts too. Barratt & the Oak Tree comes immediately to mind.
I have an estate car 2021 Suzuki space.not in the Granada class, in my younger days always had ford,and was lucky enough to have owned an eightyish saloon felt like royalty oh to wind the clock back. By the way did you buy it?
Very beautiful car. I can see the love that was given to this car and the joy it gave them. Hope it finds someone who loves it just as much.
The second car I drove, bought from an engineering company in Stockport. Ford Granada 2.8 ghia x mK2, loved it. Milage was really low, 27,000 back in 1988.
Hi why is the saloon at the start left hand drive?
I remember these. I did a shell change on one back in the mid eighties when I was a professional Ford mechanic working for W H Perry in Rayleigh, Essex.
what a lovely sight to see a twelve year old ford Granada chasseur being started for the first time in over twelve years & in wander fill condion as well been kept in a garage for that length of time hope it goes to a collection like at dagenham and barking collection it deserves to be put some where & left instead of given to end it life on a race track or banger raced ?
Great episode Jonny - am I really that old that I remember these when they were new!  Not sure if anyone has mentioned it previously, but from the MOT history, that odometer must be broken as it's had 49,999 miles recorded on it since at least the first digital MOT record in 2006 - that being said, it looks to be a remarkable survivor and a rare beast indeed.  Thanks for sharing!
You had the Granada we had the XD Falcon same year different countries slight differences
The days when UK Ford cars were interesting
My dad had a few of these, last one was a black 2.8 ghia auto, lovely big car, loved the sound of it as it shifted up through that lazy gearbox
My dad had a Granada Ghia. Bloody loved that car.
Beautiful Jonny.  Lucky person who ends up with that.
Where they the ones that came with the white ghia wheels
In South Africa, you could also order from Ford either a 5L V8 Mustang , ( Basil Green - Perana ) for a go faster model, or .a 6,6L V8 for towing. Ford also supplied a Capri V8 5L Mustang from Basil Green - Perana
Jonny buy it…..then do a series of restore videos
Love it :)
Superb, ford granada one of the best estate cars ever made. My father had 3 of them over the 70,s and 80,s ,2.8gl ,2. ,8a and a 2.8i ghia x
Prescott motors Burton Latimer.
A local car to me...I had several Granadas ncluding a mk2 Ghia estate....still got a shed full of parts lol
Someone needs to learn how to wash your car properly.
I got a v6 manual Grandad for £60 when I was a Student at Bridgy College and we use to have a right laugh in it as I think it easy took 10 of use to/from the pub. Though thirsty for fuel, it was years back when it was cheap and the price of the car at the time reflected the running cost. I worked in a bike shop and got it stickered up as a mountain bike shuttle and many bike racks on the roof after watching the MTB Treds movie. With the back seats down a bike would go in without removing any wheels, great times we had rallying the old boat around the hills. Sold it at what I bought it for if I remember correctly.
Brings back happy memories of my 2.3GL best car I’ve owned.
Nice one Jonny and Dave. A very nice film you have produced here lads. I really enjoyed watching and listening.  Please allow me to share a little. It takes me back to the late 80s when I bought one second hand. It was not exactly like this, it was a 1983 Ford Granada 2.8 injection Ghia X saloon in light metallic blue. Registration A515 LNA I bought it in Manchester for £4750 and I loved owning it and driving it. It felt as solid as a rock and it was supremely comfortable and plenty quick enough and I loved the sound of the engine. I was very proud of my two extra spotlights mounted in front of the grill too, that came on with the full beam and I loved my electric aerial that I had fitted.  At least I loved it until the day a lazy seagull demolished it!  I was not a happy camper that day, i’d only had the new aerial fitted for about two weeks! I was very attached to the car and I kept it for about eight years, then I moved into a black Granada Scorpio 2.9 injection hatchback. One of my very few non-saloon cars.  Anyway thanks for bringing back happy memories of my time with my Granada.  Congratulations on your success with the channel and I look forward to more of your excellent content in the future.
Great respect shown, carry on the good work.
Brilliant stuff Jonny 👏 👌
Ford e skrot🤑
You have to buy this car dude…….its a fantastic looking motor vehicle and practical too, where else will you find another like it?!.🥰🥰🥰
I remember the Olympic badge and the beige lower paint but didn’t  know they had a special name or that they were rare as I saw a couple around in the 80s and 90s .. I guess any mk2 granny will be pretty rare now as people only seemed to preserve and restore the mk1s in the 90s and 00s ,. I loved my 2.8i Ghia saloon (which I got real cheap as it had been a funeral car), I’m sure it had the metric wheels originally too but the funeral directors changed them for similar looking standard sized ford ones .
Great channel lad,greetings from the Emerald isle 👍🏻
Checked the MOT history.  The mileage was recorded as 49,999 in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then it was obviously mis-read and recorded as 49,990 in 2011. No MOT since that date. Unless the car was taken to the MOT test centre on a trailer the recorded mileage would indicate that the Odometer is not working.
ln the 80 th l bought a Granada combi for small money to drive the turkish man who rented the flat from my grandfather home to anatolia . ln the back we had a washing mashine , a tv , a frigde and a lot more of his houshold . He payed the bills and we had a good time . The granada was running like hell . After l dropped him off l made a bit of sightseeing in turkey .Never had problems with the car . I should have kept it . Cheers from germany
Great luggage........was it a setup for DJ 's looks 12" square..
Brown and tartan.............there are some trousers out there for you..
Wonder if there will be a channel like this in 40yrs time, when grey try to start a car from today's era, the type that requires a masters degree in quantum physics and code just to change a light bulb
My dads mate had one of those exactly the same … he won the pools in early 80s and it was the first thing he bought. I remember staring at it on his drive when walking back from school…. and I’ll never forget that Olympic decal on the back , it made it a real special car in mine and my mates eyes … until the orion 16 injection ghia came along of course
My friend had a Mark 1 , 2.8 Litre. These Cars were also issued with a 5 Litre in South Africa ! This one is really unique, gotta love that Sticker Decal. Back then the Car was Ultra Deluxe, with those 4 bags and interior (Leather/Tartan), 2-Tone.
What a absolute beauty I hope this gets the love like it once had what a car!! With 49999 unbelievable shame cars nowadays ain't kept in condition like older generations did
The registration has me wondering was it originally a Northern Irish car.
This looks so much like a 1979 Aussie Ford Falcon which came with a 4.1 Lt pushrod 6cylinder or a 5.8 Lt V8.
An ironic name for a car that's British.
OMG, he's a lefty, how British!
I do hope that some soap was added to that sprayer. Otherwise...
Hauling a caravan with just a V6? No V8 offered?
'The rubbers are in good condition' indeed! (For her sake, one hopes so!)
Estate cars have boots, really?
Why Lynn and family never considered putting under a tarp is astounding.
If that interior is not an authentically, 'officially recognized and registered' tartan, it's just another plaid, lad.
John (ny) Smith: what an incredibly unusual, unique name.
Why are you whispering in the garage? Are you trespassing?
My boss had. 3.0 light blue auto. He used to get me to take his baby sitter home. What a car, what a girl. Wish i had them both still😅
It's funny how they are identical to the 1979 ford falcon in Australia in sedan form. Yet the xd was designed in Australia supposedly.  And the Australian one had 3.3, 4.1 six and then a 4.9 and 5.8 V8 and the big V8 was considered the one for towing.
I had a dark green four door Sierra Chasseur 1.8 carb model back in the day. It also had black trim and alloys. V comfy little barge. I can still remember how chuffed I felt when I first drove it to collect my girlfriend from the local train station.
We never got the Ford Granada here in NZ, but we got the XD Ford Falcon that had the same looking front end. The back end looks like a MK3 Cortina. Great show. Cheers from NZ Phil.
I had a '78 Mk II 2.3GL, my mate had a Mk II also from '78 but his was a 2.3L and my parents had a 1980 Mk II 2.8 Ghia. Later on I also had a Mk III 2.8 Ghia. I've owned many Fords, my favourite being my 1989 XR4x4 which I still miss to this day. I gave it too my Dad when I got a Range Rover and I'm sorry to say he killed it.
Jonny this car has the exact same front as our Ford Falcon XD here in Aus. I am perplexed! Goes to show the sharing of components that went on. The XD was a full sized family car. Am I wrong the fronts are the same?
It looks brown to me. Now why would someone leave an old car in their garage for 12 years - weird. Classeur is great as a chicken dish.
Back in the 80's my neighbour had exactly the same model while my dad had the ghia x
Fabulous,  really enjoyed that!! My dad had about four Cortinas before he got promoted at work to director and then had three company car Granadas, until he retired twenty three years ago!! His last Granada was the 2.9 i Ghia X.  When they went on holiday, I used to drive it to my warehouse work job! I was only young and it was nicer than the bosses car!! My dad would of gone mad had he known!! 😂
I worked in a filling station when I left school in 79/80 and one of the customers  had one. Great to see. Another customer had a Jenson Interceptor.  Ah,youth.
"...mixing business with pleasure".  I nearly died as you read that Jonny.  So kitsch its great.  Thanks for another great episode to Chasseur-away a Canadian winter weekend.
LOVE ❤ Granada's.  Had two of these back in the day
Could the other guy not find a pair of jeans to fit him or at least put a belt on the ones he's waering.😂😂😂
I remember when you were able to pick up mrk 2 Escorts for 20 quid and Fiesta's for about the same those were the days.😢😢 I feel old.😂😂😂
Made me smile seeing it spring in to life.
I’ve seen those in 70s tv show the Sweeney
What a fantastic video. I found myself raring for the Granada to start after all these years. I used to have a MK5 2.0 GL Cortina Estate and it was interesting to compare the similarities between the two.
Always loved the Granada as a kid in the early '80s.  There was an older series 3.0 liter, it's shape and road precesnse left a lasting impression on me till this day.  The newer 2.8i ghia and 2.10 were good lookers as well.
You can see where Ford Australia got part of the design especially around the front on our late 1970’s XD Ford Falcon the only thing is we ran 302 & 351 Australian built Cleveland V8 and 250 and base 200 ci crossflow sixes but not only in sedan but also panel vans and coupe utility, thanks to our climate there still are heaps around but more so the higher end spec models you will find are the ones that were looked after over the years more so, also we had a larger wheelbase model in LTD form as well as Fairmont and ghia modeks
And don't forget the Citroen CX25 GTI, they have 390mm metric rims. I own one, and refuse to replace those fabulous rims.
Oh you sod, this is my dream car, I'd love to have found this. I tried to buy one about 12 years ago, it was £1000 and no-one seemed to want it. By the time I'd found space someone had bought it with the plan of LPGing it, but I think in the end it was raped for its tuned V6.   Then there was a cache of about 3 found, but some twat banger racer got them all. Neve rmind I'll content muself with the 1/18 model!
I had the same one granada gia beautiful metallic blue 💙 👍🏻
YES! When I saw the video description I wondered if it was the car I walked past on the way to school every day for years, the impossibly suave Granada Chasseur, and it was!
I always related these Granada's to the Sweeney
Looks an absolute gem 💎 a n excellent example
A very nice car! Love it!  :)
What a find! Best one to date. Thank you very much.
I Saw a brand new one !! When i was 10 my dad took me with him to Alderley Edge Ford dealers in Cheshire to chose a new 1981 Ford Cortina Ghia.We sat in the office looking through colour charts and spec sheets and picked a tibetan gold 2.0 Ghia manual with cocolate velour PRE667W.All very nice but outside the office window by the entrance was a stunning brand new Granada Chasseur with its 2 tone paint and gold wheels and little stick people doing sports decals, I was stunned by its imposing presence and have never forgotten it so am really pleased to watch your video and once again see one up close for the first time since that day thankyou👍
As long as you’re insured you can just get these old things running and drive about in them
I'm 42 grown up in the car game sort of,,,, I dont know why but iv wanted one for years, I think it's the rear lights,,, not the one in the garage but the one his driving
Nice. Granada.  👍
Never heard of it but strangely now want one that one🤔😂
brilliant car with a very interesting history & provenance, but I cannot understand for someone who was so into their cars, did not put the car under a dust cover. It will be a cracking car when recommissioned.
Can not believe he revved like that from hibernation!!!! Vandalism
My Nissan 300ZX came with R390, and I couldn’t source 1 tyre for it (was delivered with rim only, and spare from Mercedes mounted on), most local shops couldn’t understand what tyre size do I want, and only one, where older chap (in his 50s) was working, said he haven’t seen those in ages, and remember his BMW 5 series had ones on it as well. I have spare set of alloys from my van, and these will be added on once Z31 is fully restored
Wow u don't get these cars anymore.!! They were the bosses of cars back in the day. Do urll have any to for sale in the UK??
Wow u don't get these cars anymore.!! They were the bosses of cars back in the day. Do urll have any to for sale in the UK??
Such excellent Content. Well done Jonny.
Rare?, LOL that's because they were hardly sold because they were horrible,  Interior looked like the inside of a fortune tellers tent. Reality
What a rare find I love these Engish Fords. Never seen one of these before
You Brits are so lucky to have those nice small Granada's us Yanks we're stuck with the big huge tanks.
Would of made them an offer there and then if I had the money  Lovely car .
Jonny,THIS is the car for you mate. You can just see it's the perfect car for you. Great video,very well and honestly made . I subbed your channel now. Keep it up👍👍
The washing of the car is so satisfying
My Father went from a Zepher 4 (his 2nd) to a Silver Ford Exec to the Bronze 3.0 V6 Granada Gia. It was like an XL sized Capri. However unlike the grossly underpowered and rubbish handling Capri, the Granada handled and went like stink. It left oh so many sports cars for dust away from traffic lights. 3000 rpm 2nd gear, dump the clutch and lift the front wheels 3' in the air! Brilliant fun. 85mph peak revs in 2nd.
My 1st Saab 900 turbo classic was on metric tyres. 1983 they cost £86 each! Effectively 2 tyres = I months mortgage! And they lasted 6000 miles!
So 10 years ( 2011) ago the car had its last MOT and after the MOT it only covered 9 miles!
Ah, memories of my Roman bronze MK3 cortina, I purchased it from my very good friend in early 80s (83) then next morning took it out and it was stolen, police found it that night minus wheels, petrol tank & rear seats😭
The blue Granada in the intro was identical to my dad's in 1979 - colour, vynil roof, wheels.. Except that his was a GXL, your one was a Ghia. The 3.0 V6 had a charming whistle sound from the fanbelt as it ticked over.
My friends dad had one I’m sure. It doesn’t seem that long ago, but working it out it’s over 20 years and to be honest the old girl was full of the dreaded tin worm 😞
Yes oh yes my beauty, it’s longer than I remember, ok
Cracking episode.  My dad had a red Mk1 Ford Granada Estate. He towed the caravan with it and we and relations, 7 of us went from Scotland to France in it to stay in a Gite. My cousin and I were the youngest and took turns at travelling in the estate boot with the luggage. You couldn't travel like that nowadays.  You should definitely buy it Jonny as you really appreciate it. If you don't you will never get the opportunity again.
What a find.. Absolutely superb
Wow fantastic
I read Barn find Ford Granada and i think to myself a 1979 Granada (US)?? POS car... Nobody would even open the door let alone want to see one, ahhh but this is the Euro Version and probably a better vehicle, carry on... the TRX tires we so no traction too
What a rare find.  Once I had a light green metallic Granada Estate, automatic, with a V6. Loved it!
It's 4.30 am and I wanted something worth watching and this was , GOOD JOB 👍
The front reminds me of the Austarlian XD Ford Falcon which is the same vintage.
These types of video are the best. Buy it Jonny!
Would love to banger race it😂
It looks like the car came from Prescotts Garage which was in Burton Latimer selling used cars in the 80`s, Great video, takes you back to when cars were made properly and built to last as this has, we used some of the Consul`s and Cortina`s for taxis.
Needs to go to the Ford Museum , if they dont have one
Cracking episode as per my old gold 2.8 estate was my second car bought for £250 quid  popped a mattress in back and used to go camping i remember the day I had it pulled up to let a car pass and I pulled off and all I saw was smoke as it was just spinning on spot happy days it was good to see you in person in flesh in show in Manchester even though I think I scared you with my purple hair lol
Miss my old estate sjs122s
Buy it mate if you have the money .. you wont find a better one anywhere
Love your stuff on Fifth Gear... I guessed immediately that it would be a Chasseur. My first car was a Granada Ghia, Red / Black. Loved it. Would have a coupe in a heartbeat. Deservedly the best selling executive car in Britain by a country mile, but I wish The SD1 had put up a better fight...
The only thing about this car that holds it back has to be the V6. In comparison you got a 4.2L I6 from Jag or 3.5L V8 from Rover. I would guess this wasn't a cheap car by any means in it's day unless one got lucky and managed to get a discount. The rest of the engineering and certainly the looks are there for that Granada.
Why wasn't this sent to the USA instead of the simpering fwd garbage Taurus. This car with the OHC sixes from Australia, a 351w, 351c or at least a nice 302 with a manual transmission would be an incredible little gem of a do it all car. An LS swap would certainly hit the spot as well.
That was risky washing an 80is car not only that a ford i can here it rusting from here 😂
They only came with those rims From memory They did it with an injection engine And they had the driving lamps as standard.. Which seem to be missing on this car. I doubt its injected.. Great trip down memory lane
Sold these cars back in the day Ford in the late 70's early 80's Had a 30+ %market share And an enviable product range.. The rarest I should imagine today Would be the previous model coupe And the 2.8is manual Was a beast.. But in SA there put a 5.0 in it... Great content
I really hope whoever buys this actually drives it. Cars are not made to sit in garages or museums.
Buy it Jonny,  you'll regret it someday if not!!!
BUY IT !
In the early 80s I was an apprentice at Dees of Croydon, a large Ford dealership.  The Directors all had the best Granada models - I remember the son David Dees had a Chasseur for himself, probably for a year or so.  We'd stand by it ready to 'clock out' at 5.30 peering through the windows at the seats and luggage. This is a true 'time warp' car, that sound of it revving so freely takes me back............Also takes me back to the amount of stripped timing gears we had to do on the Cologne engines!
So pleased i never grew up in the awful 80s.
Oooh, Jonny, that Granny you're driving is a bit special.
awesome love it 👍🏻
I worked with a couple of lad who were ceiling fixer’s in Sainsburys Dudley in 1983 one of those guys had one and I sill remember it so well lovely lovely car
Yes rare, black trim always suited the mk2
Familiar sound in the 80s of cold Ford engines trying to start.
I was born in 1980, so seeing this was very pleasing. Thank you. Such a well looked after car! Johnny, if you’re thinking of buying you ought to buy it, pretty sure you’d never find another in such good condition and with that low mileage 😁
So Mr. Smith did you add it to your collection? I remember the Granada well.
will there be a follow up on this one?
nearly made me cry that did, alive she is
Over 40 years ago I owned a Ford Consul  estate metallic gold  ...  the sister car to this , just brought back a lot memories, luxury car to drive.
not sure if you know the german word „wunderbar“ what means wounderful - nothing else to add. cheers
Hi Jonny did u bay the ford Granada
One of the best ford's ever produced in Europe the MK2 grannie, I loved my granada's. The late MK2 Ghia X executive was my personal favourite. Was the special edition series one saloon a sapphire? Seem to recall that.... I only ever had one series one a 2.0 L, a very rare car today that.
Great video, loved the part where you washed it and the bronze paintwork revealed its true beauty..
Please Jonny buy it. It needs to be restored and looked after by a professional. And I only really trust you with it.
What a find I'm more of a Mk1 Granada fan I owned 3 of them lol but that thing is a beauty & I really hope it goes to an enthusiast & not end up round a banger track so definitely needs to be saved restored & showed, looking at the plates it looks like it originated in Northamptonshire.
Buy it jhonny lad
Maybe rude to say but if was ever looking for a new home to continue its journey then count me in...
Nice older car.  Well done boys.  This is a proper size and shape for a station wagon as we call them over here (Calif).  The modern EV makers need to look at these dimensions and do something similar.  OK, jelly bean nose if need be.  But the interior shape that will take square'ish large objects and people with a big Greenhouse is essential for function and comfort.
I had a 528i with metric wheels. I was able to buy a set of M5 wheels and tyres for less that a set of metric tyres....
The wife's dad had the mark 4 Cortina estate in the same year and the same colour. It was used as a total work horse. So bringing back some fantastic memories. What an amazing find and really beautiful car in near new condition. Great video 👍 Cheers
Lovely car.....always had a soft spot for ford granadas....love from Malaysia
I hate modern cars they all look the same to me and have no character like the old uns 🙂
You can't deny and not appreciate the old classics, I never knew about this model. My mates dad had a blue granada. My dad was a German car lover v dubs audis. My dad died in a passat in the late 80's 😥. I always bought ford's. Xrs rs's I will always be a ford man.
Great barn find! love it! greetings from Almere, the Netherlands
Hay Jonny, great video mate, evoked happy memories of working on old fords with my old man. That moment you get a car running! Pure joy. Good to see Dave Retroford too, you make a great team. Thanks man 🤘
Absolutely love this video
I enjoy love stories like this one, complete with a happy ending.
Was smiling when it came out the garage, smiling when it started, smiling all this brought memories of mine, 2.8i ghia gold estate, it was a minter, used to tow me caravan all over the country no issues, had to sell it in the  80s due to a 2 year ban 🙄 last tax was 97 wonder if its in a barn some where, HDH 497T if anyone finds it let me know 👍
That's one great find, and videoed so well. You've taken me right back to childhood, sat in the back of dad's Granada, although his was the face-lift saloon. He was doing well back then and made it to near the last pages of the brochure and had the 2.8i Ghia X in what I think was called Nimbus Grey (why can I remember that!?). Thanks for rekindling so many memories!
There was one of these around Pleasley, Nottinghamshire back in the 80's.   My Dad had Y Reg 2.8i and a 2.8 GHIA at different times.
just epic
I remember the Metric Tires, had a guy with the TRX wheels on a Mercury Capri.  Was down to only Michelin making them, but could buy them in their Sears labeled Weather Beater brand for like $110 a tire vs $165 if they said Michelin on the side.
dogging was invented in that car
Those Granada motors were proper gangster. Great memories
This needs t be taken to Hamsters new place to get it back to factory mint (not concours).  A true museum piece but still needs to be used as it was meant to be.
That interior is absolutely stunning! What a find!
Such a lovely car, did you treat yourself?
What a lovely old workhorse. The leather is absolutely stunning for its age. Also, very glad to see you have recovered Jonny - I think we were all worried for you and your family for a while.
weird looks like a cross between an aussie falcon wagon and a cortina
My grandmother had a mk2 Granada estate in an orange-red and the sports wheels that were carried over from the mk1.  She used to have one alsation in the boot and an alsation and black labrador on the back seats.
Real nice! I grew up in Norway,and my father had a brown, with brown vinylroof 73 Granada manual 3000 estate. Good program,btw!
Proper bit of film Jonny, really is. You've got to buy her, you really do, even after they've nearly all been killed by the banger boys, I fear it could easily end up in the wrong hands and sent round an oval.  Awesome stuff as always
Talbot Tagora had metric tyres!
Lovely car.
It’s a lovely car
I was Ford mad as a kid and I can remember these being launched. Chasseur is a type of casserole I think. I’d be very surprised if there is a more original one left, and to have the luggage set intact is unbelievable. I really hope it goes to a good home.
I owned a 3 litre Consul GT 1977 traded it in and bought a ford Granada 2.8 ghia sold that and bought the ford Granada 2.8i ghia x pack one of the best cars I’ve ever owned
My Dad had a workshop behind a car showroom in Southend in 1986 and they had one for sale , I remember it very well !
God I love the anticipation of if an old car will start!
Some one actually owns registration plate 1 FMC as featured on the Granads advert. It is on a 2005 Ford GT.
My dad had a 2.8gl brilliant car YPB794T.
Love it what a  find
I had 4 Granadas loved them
Friend had a 2.8 Gia X  Saloon with all the options. It was a mean looking machine black with a ton of chrome previous owner owned a very successful body shop and no expense was spared. 90s, pulled all the time because it stood out and looked like a drug dealers Car. 😂 Being late 40’s I love seeing the like on the roads as it just takes me back and let’s face it everything looks very similar these days that old classics jump out now on the roads.  Someone buy this and bring it back 👍 I was willing it on, come on, come on - It’s alive 😁
Remember these well, neighbour bought one from new. Used to love getting a lift to school in it. Colour was so great / seemed so fancy back then.
Awesome cant be many left in that condition you should buyy it jonny
we must live in different worlds, i once found a moldy turd in an old abandoned house but i didn't make a video of it.
I was car dealing in the late 80s and had loads of grandads (as we called them) I always thought they were nice cars, had 2.0,2.3,2.8s and popular sellers, had a Mk 1 3 l ghia on the forecourt at 595 in bronze.
Love this Jonny!  I can’t stop thinking about the guy who cared for it for all those years. Then when she fired up, brought a proper lump to my throat!  Keep them coming, it’s great entertainment…
Leaded or unleaded, that's the question? Lovely car, great video. It's captured my attention, I had to watch it all. Shane. :-)
Garage?     Guh roge ?
Hi Jonny ! Wow ! Gosh, this brings back memories for me, when I was about 11/12 my Dad had one on loan from a family friend, I remember it was a goldy bronzy colour Ford Granada Estate 2.8i Ghia automatic. I could be wrong but I think it was something like an S reg, 1977/78. I remember we were out as a family one Sunday taking the dog for a walk and we drove somewhere in Kent that had a massive car park. My Mum n Dad left me and my bro in the car while they took the dog for a walk, Dad had left the keys in the ignition and as I already had some idea of how to drive I decided I was going to drive it around the empty car park, turned the key, engine on, remember my age and this is a 2.8i , in to D and planted my foot on the accelerator ! Oh shitttttttttttt !!!!!!!.....luckily remembered to use the brake and come to a stop without hitting anything. Me and my brother were laughing our heads off , to this day I don't think our parents knew we had driven the car around the car park. I remember it being a big old beast and such fun to drive. Great memories. Cheers, Daz, Leicester.
This brings back memories, I used to work on those when I was an apprentice.  They suddenly seemed to disappear from the roads when they became popular for banger racing.
wow extremely rare wow 👌 this must be last one remaining
20 years ago I thought the days of barn finds were numbered but here we are 2021/22 and they are still surfacing
I had a 1976 Ford Granada and I have to say, mine definitely did not look anything like that for the American market. It was garbage.
We had the last Granada, the Scorpio 2.3D maybe our best car ever!!! It was for towing our caravan, the only thing I disliked was the long tail which made the caravan sway easily. Due to ageing parents, we swapped the Scorpio for a Ford Galaxy with 7 seats. We now have a 2014 VW Transporter 5 seat van to tow with. That's been a nightmare from new, on its 2nd engine, a new head, water pump, then the ECU gave up. It took 6 months to repair at a cost of                   £ 6,000.oo+. The finding was iron filings in the fuel line from the HP fuel pump to the injectors, now it runs as it should have from new. I miss the old BIG FORDS for towing with, I brought our son then daughter up on Fords, but we have now all moved on, sad I know but if they're now making what you want that's the way it goes!!! Ps, Great Show Jonny!!!
Very good condition . Ha I had an American  1977 Ford Granada ( 2 door coupe with a 351w) the same color as this one except with the old “baby shit yeller”  interior ,( I think it even smelt bad,
I remember PDI ing one of these when I worked with a Ford dealer in Greenock [Alexanders] I think they only ever sold one as far as I can recall, pretty faultless although the automatics at times wouldn't go into reverse or top when cold , strip the box and replace high and reverse o rings , thermostat housing used to corrode and crumble due to incorrect coolant mix and poor quality alloy casting, diffs could whine but then again all the Ford range did , countless rebuilds under warranty , high mileage models would eventually crack the Flexi plate/ ring gear which would give an alarming rattle , we used to repair Granada Hearses under warranty and as daft apprentices we had plenty adventures with them , constantly grounded and plenty kicks up the arse ...happy days.
With regard to the TRX tyres, I had a Saab 900 turbo fitted with these wheels/ tyres. I think these were unique to Michelin and they had a special feature,  they were designed so that in the event of a ‘blow-out’ the tyre remained on the rim. This required a unique rim/ tyre design combination. I think they were in metric sizes to prevent the fitting of an ordinary tyre.
That's got to be worth £5k all day long! Maybe a tad more with a bit of a light restoration.
Lovely Granny. Hope it goes to the right owner and is kept firmly away from the banger boys
A pure delight to watch this! I'm not as much a Granada fan as a Ford Capri - with the ultra long bonnet hiding a V6 (long enough to hide a straight 8 cylinder engine) - or an Edsel huuuuge enough to hide a small suburb under the bonnet and all citizens of a village in the back seat. Dad was an auto mechanic and he was able to start just about anything or, at least, figure out what was wrong and then work around it to make any engine tick and purr. Superb finding! 👍
Love this channel. Super work Jonny.  Thank you.
Don't chicken🐓 out of buying it !
Absolutely superb cars would pul a house down had about 5 of them when cars were cars excellent video thankyou bought back a lot of memories
BUY BUY BUY Johnny, I just about remember seeing one of these in what was my local Ford Dealership Ringways in the early 1980's, they nearly always had the special editions in the showroom like the Ford Capri Cabaret and Calypso.
I had a Cortina Estate of the same vintage and it was one of my favourite cars. My next move was going to be the Granada Estate, but of course that didn't happen - best laid plans, etc.
The colour takes me back. In 1977 I bought a new roman bronze Capri GL complete with beige vinyl roof. It looked stunning in its day.
I had a 1984 Ford Falcon XE in Sydney, Australia. It was similar to this, but wider and with a straight six 3.3 carb engine. I shoehorned a 351 V8  but didnt know I had to change to a 9 inch diff and bigger wheels/tyres etc.
So well preserved, i think it looks very smart. It's made before my time, this car is about five years older then me. Surely Chops has a written agreement that Jonny can't buy barn find cars 🤣. In any case, i hope it finds a good home. My condolences to the family of the late owner.
There was another limited edition mk2 granada estate that was very pale green. Not sure what it was called though. Might have been a sierra?.
In about 1980 i used to work at the local Ford garage and saw one in for service. What a beautiful car it was. I have subsequently bought 2 Granada's, admittedly they were the later hatchbacks but still lovely cars to drive.
OMG! Absolutely amazing!
Wow what a lovley classic can’t believe the condition of it that is mint for its year some one took great care of this and was well loved 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
My Dad had two Granada Estates both 2.8i Ghia X models. One was x reg the next one was b reg. then after he had a E reg Scorpio which he didn’t like as much as the Granadas. RIP Dad.
Ah yes. The metric tires. Some Ford's in the states had them as an option. Michelin TRX radials, if I remember correctly. I was working at a tire shop in the mid to late 80's. Even then it was difficult to get replacement tires and they were pricey. The customer would usually buy standard wheels and tires for replacement.
Does anyone else do Reg checks on the cars Jonny finds? I do just out of curiousity. this one has in interesting note on the last MOT. @thelatebrakeshow any reason why that could have happened?
Great Video
Absolutely stunning, what a wonderful story. I’ve never seen this edition before, fair to say groundbreaking blacking out the chrome like that. Cheers Jonny 🍻
Brilliant, I’d take one of these ol’ barges over ANYTHING new. Look how much visibility all old cars have, no massive chunky pillars obscuring your view and no on board computers to keep you in a close and expensive relationship with the manufacturer. Thee will never be cars this good again, ever.
Interesting that it has the LHD shifter.
Lovely lovely video. Sweet sweet car
Great vid Jonny. What a fantastic and rare Granada, with great history. Hope it ends up with someone who also cherishes it as much as the previous owner did.
rear lights made in Italy! great.
Absolutely brilliant guys….well nice to see an old car brought back to life  , my grandad had a estate and I always thought it was massive!
Worth it just for the snazzy interior!
Wow!!!!!. I remember My Dad looking at one of these in the mid 80s. It was for sale for £2995 at a garage near Scarborough. He ended up buying an A reg Morris Ital 1.3 SL Estate instead. I never did forgive Him......
Lovely pal
Did the MK2 estates keep the rear end of the MK1's?
Fantastic video! My late Father had two Automatic Granada Estates, a 1977 MK1 3.0 GL and a 1979  pre facelift MK2 2.8 Ghia both in Strato silver.I can remember as a 9 year old boy, being very upset when he sold the 2.8 Ghia in 1983.I would buy this car in a heart beat.
Great video 👍 PE teacher Miss Tim's had one when I was at Tudor school in Surrey.
Great video as always Thanks my Dad n I loved the Granada's the B reg Ghia X 2.8i was his n mine was his Granada Cosworth Scorpio 2.9i full leather all the toys n a mate of mine had bored out 3.0L with a manual gearbox it went through a few clutches but damm thing flew iv a 2.8i V6 ford Galaxy now n it purrs such a great sound. Thanks for the memories keep up the Great work stay safe Full Send UK peace
My dad was doing some work at the local ford garage in 1980, i was helping I remember seeing  one all ready and waiting for its new owner. looked great. 1 year latter i started work at  a Ford dealer
Beautiful car Jonny.  If I had the cash I'd have it. 😎👍
A beauty of a car ... now we have to hope the banger-racing community doesn't get their hands on it.
I’m not a Ford guy never had one but this is truly amazing what a condition for a forty one year old car. Definitely an eights style car and in original condition with all its quirky parts ( luggage) This will be a special addition to someone’s collection I’m sure.  Hens teeth springs to mind, it’ll be one of a few left. Quality programming as usual guys. You,re taking YouTube to a whole new level. Take Care Stay Safe Everyone Regards Dave 👍😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haha, lm in love! I had an 81 2.8is Granada saloon but I really wanted as my dad would say, “ a shooting brake “” I smile  at the memory! Hey if it is for sale I might be your boy! Alistair from sunny aberdeen ,!
I used to love finding old fords,best I had was at Clacton carnival lady came over as I’d just completed a rebuild of a cortina mk11 crayford gt,she said I’ve got a cortina in my garage was my late husband’s. Went next day expecting maybe a gt as I pulled the garage door up there sat a mk 11 cortina lotus, fired up and on the trailer.. won’t mention the 68 corsair with an rs 3.1 on triples under the bonnet ha ha ,. Or the 71 mk1 escort van 1 owner 37,000 miles and my   Escort Mexico used as a recce car by mason and Clark in 73 safari
Buy it! What a great survivor car.
That woman will have grease on the arm of her coat.... just sayin..........
I remember the times when you could pick these up for the equivalent of 50 quid and a packet of cigarettes was already sitting in the passenger seat along with half a bottle of booze... They were junkers, of course and after the oil crisis nobody wanted them anymore.
My father had one 2.8 Ghia when ford made to last for ever
WoW…. Can I buy it???
Lovely jubly 😜💥🇬🇧

Metric wheels & tyres - I used to have a 1988 Jag XJ40 Sovereign on Metric wheels - you're right, the tyres did cost 3 to 4 times the cost of 'normal' imperial dimensioned ones.
There used to be one of these in the same brown up the road from where I lived in Carlisle in the early eighties I can't remember which way round they where but they also had the 2.8i Ghia X. I suspect the Ghia in blue would have been the later one.  Ohh and if you don't buy this....you did though didn't you, please tell me you bought it.  Peace Charlie 🇬🇧
Very nostalgic for several generations. Amused me that he had extended the garage to accommodate the Chasseur. (I certainly recall the Sierra version of it). Our neighbour had bought a brand new two-tone Granada MkII saloon (silver lower half I believe, and either dark grey or dark green top half) for himself and a brand new Capri for his wife. He had a long single width garage, but it wasn't quite long enough to park the Granada and Capri line astern. So he modified the garage door so it closed to 45 degrees and then bent the door in half over the end of the Capri and built side panels to fully enclose the Capri's nose! Mad, but effective. Great work, Jonny and the team!
Please buy it Jonny! Leave it as it is, it's a stunner.
My aunt had a m reg 74 in metallic purple black vinyl roof 3.0 v6 essex motor beautiful car also a v reg 2.8 gl green metallic 1980 model.
I rented a 2.8 i for my wedding in 1979, it was t reg so 1978 so a lot were fuel injection.
Good old memories when it's you and your dad...and your trying to start and old girl.....  The waft....fuel, oil and soot....magical when something comes back to life.
Wow,this video is unbelievable,that car is truly hens teeth,where would you find another? I do remember them one in my home town in the mid 80s,I think you should seriously consider buying it- you won't regret it.
My Ford Escort 1.3L mk2 1980V was Sable Brown Metallic. This Granada Chasseur is such a beautiful car.
STUNNING  Great colour way.  Would love it.
I'm actually after one of these to build a family daily, I'm going to use the running gear from the  mondeo/transit diesel update the electronics keeping it as original as possible, today's cars just don't have the character size or practicality of a 80s 90s estate yet the old estates don't meet today's regulations or saftey, it been a build I've wanted to do for years but finding a good based is pretty hard, but this isn't somthing to be messed about with imo as there's not many as original or as rear as that this was real good content and I enjoyed every second of it well done lads 👌
My dad had two, we called them Grandads instead. I remember them with fondness. Big, comfy and up market. The 2.8i went fairly quickly too.
Well done Johnny looks amazing I don't like forrrrrrrrrdddddddddssssaaaaa as a rule but always wanted a Mk2 Granada Estate Really pleased to see you like a giddy school boy just remember golden rule "You wash it you buy " 😉
Wonderful video Jonny and what a lovely car  (Chausseur is French for Shoemaker ?) - id love this car - needs to be used, enjoyed and cared for - it  would look wonderful towing our Caravan :-)   I remember looking at one of these with my Dad at a used  Rolls Royce dealer in the midlands when I was 13 or 14. the car had been taken in part exchange. the dealer wanted £3300 pounds for it at the time and my dad uhhmd and aaaghd as the car, although about 18 months younger than our 2.8 GL Manual Saloon had done around 70,000 miles (twice that of our 2.8GL), leather was scuffed, one of the bags was missing out of the rear and the straps were ripped on the others plus numerous  dings and scratches on the body. he decided it was not the car for us :-( we did however buy a very low mileage W Plate 2.8GL Auto Estate (WPU 46W)  in metallic graphite grey from our local Ford dealer - Lloyds of Stafford  shortly afterwards; done 50,000 miles and one owner and was a lovely head turning car and immaculate. I recall we paid the same price as the Chausseur had been @£3,300. Dad kept this one for a few years until we drove past a local performance car dealer who had an X Plate Granada 2.8 Injection 200 Estate @£6150....... What is one of these I hear you ask ? Well ..... it was the Granada version of the Capri 2.8injection and Ford only made a total of 200 of them; came in Red / White / Blue and Graphite Black. TRX alloys the same as the Chasseur but in white for all body colour options rather than Gold. Recaro seats - Manual 5 speed Box, top mounted round front driving lamps, below bumper spoiler. very mean looking car  indeed. He then replaced it with the ex Geneva Motor Show  A reg 2.8i Chia X Manual Estate with Roof Rack Deleted (?? Not sure why ) cost then was £7200) - had  TRX's , front spoiler, round upper bumper driving lights and and lower bumper fog lights; my dad had this car for about 6 yrs and had the valves, guides and seats done to handle unleaded (big money I recall at the time !) he ran this one into the ground (litterally) - rusted through rear tailgate, front bumper lip and scabs around the lower bodywork and got £1200 for it when sold about 5 yrs later.....
I actually sold one of these second hand. In the 80s I worked at KT Dartford an RS dealer near the Dartford tunnel.One day a very smart chap walked into the showroom and asked if we had a used one,I explained I didn't think we had ever had a new one or even seen one, he commented neither had he. When he left he gave me his card he owned a large abbey in Kilkenny Southern Ireland I joked I wasn't surprised he hadn't seen one Any way would you believe less than month later we had one traded in which after another long story  I was able to sell to him .KT was a very unusual RS dealer that most people had never heard of.Whiie I was there I had a Tickford Capri which another dealer borrowed and wrote off ,An automatic Capri injection, an RS2000 Mk2 on a Y reg a Fiesta Supersport on a A plate, we had 16 RS1600i in stock when most dealers like Thomas Motors Blackpool couldn't get 1. David the owner ran around in Duncan Hamiltons road going GT40 and Hannu Mikkolas London to Mexico Escort that Ford lent him It was strange seeing it parked around Dartford probably not locked and certainly no road tax. As Nick said these are memories to look back on!
I love these videos Jonny - my Dad had a Granada 2.8 Ghia in Oyster Gold - takes me back - thanks for the memories 😃👍
Sadly, it looks like the miles are stuck on 49,999
Mrs Richards: "I paid for a room with a view !"   Basil: (pointing to the lovely view) "That is Torquay, Madam."   Mrs Richards: "It's not good enough!"   Basil: "May I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?..."   Mrs Richards: "Don't be silly! I expect to be able to see the sea!"  Basil: "You can see the sea, it's over there between the land and the sky."   Mrs Richards: "I'm not satisfied. But I shall stay. But I expect a reduction."   Basil: "Why?! Because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment ?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POO4lrTclNY&t=169s
Nice to see the old car in all its glory.  But not the mechanics arse shot in the Engine Bay Video 😂😂. Ha ha.
Most enjoyable vid. Brought back memories of my 2.8i ghia  x executive, I loved that car. When I came to sell it the phone didn't stop ringing for 2 days. It was rare 30 years ago, wouldn't imagine there are many left now.
Is there a follow up video and did you buy it, love it myself
It's look like a ford falcon  1980s
Wow that was such a great video, I remember the model in the Sierra  more than probably the Granny. That car rolled off the production line the year I left school so a nice point in time. Thanks for a great film covering it.  I hope you do buy it.
This car brings back memories, My Dad had a Ford Granada, and we would drive between Johanesburg and Port Elizabeth and Durban, then in the UK my first car was the same brown Granada Karman Ghia which is crashed after my test. So many memories.
Hi Johnny yeah I remember this car when I work for dees of Croydon in 1980 I used to deliver like vehiclesI didn’t think I’d ever see another one and I think they’re about £10,000 it certainly takes me back to when I was a young man great video thank you
Well the euro Ford Granada is far different from the American Ford Granada. lol Nice. But quite different.
We had a '78 Mark 2 Escort in that Bronze colour in the 80's. Very nice. 👍  It had circular headlights (ftw) which we use to paint every year to go to France. I notice some models had square headlights. Anyone know which trim got which light? It was a Popular Plus.
The mileage has been recorded the same on every MOT since 2006.
Is it sad that I knew it was on metric tyres because of the tread pattern 🤔
I thought it was painted like that so they could rename it to get rid of them before the updated version came along a year later. The 2.8i Ghia X pack was light year's ahead
,
Awesome video Jonny. Always reminds me of the Mk2 Estate in Lock Stock. Love a good barn find. More of these would be good.
Always, always a good sign of a good owner is door protection strips on any walls a car might be close to.   What a fantastic barn find.
My dad was a granada man a white mk1 mel488p an oyster gold mk2 clj561t and a two tone 2.8ghia pfx86w 😀
Beautiful car, love your videos
yep, remember the Chasseur. Dad had 2.8GL saloon on a V reg, then 2.3 GL estate on an X then B reg 2.3 LX. Hence we had all the Ford brochures  including details of this very fine motor. Remember longing for leccy windows in the rear but that would have meant Chasseur, Ghia or Ghia X that were out of reach. This may be the greatest youtube video ever made, nice one
Served my time on these..great car with the crappest engine ford ever used....
It's not an American video. There weren't 15 wash buckets, an airport grade foam cannon and a "refinish scientist" to be seen.
I remember seeing this in the showroom at vospers main dealer in Plymouth, my parents use to have ford grandads of all marks including the ultra rear coupe dark blue black vynil roof my favorite
Banger racers dream that!
cool. thats what i think
Just love it when you get them going! I was willing it on in my head! Fantastic survivor car! More like this Jonny!👍😊👏👏👏
Gosh this takes me back , my dad had a 1977 mk 1 Granada estate and later in the early 80s a mk2 Saloon Ghia the same vintage  in  Blue  I had a litre  cortina mk4 Ghia at the time but was always in love with  his 2.8 , wonderful cars from that period.
Why do you start and run the old engine on 20/30 year old oil ? Would you not give it fresh oil before cranking it over, instead of circulating crusty condensation contaminated oil?  Plus you keep the old battery with 0 volts connected taking down the voltage of the jump pack..
john prescott motors ...
I remember the Granada version very well but don't really remember the Sierra one which is embarrassing as I use to work at a Ford dealership in the parts department in the 80s /90s 🤦 Edit just noticed it had silver alloys (or they look silver) in the vid   , I  do remember they was gold or a  goldish colour alloys on the ones I saw. also my manager had a two tone dark blue top silver bottom half Granada Ghia X pack 2.8i .
Another rare model is the "S", had distinct white rims, I've only ever seen one in the flesh. Great vid 👌
I put an engine in one in the mid 80s when I was an apprentice in a small garage. I remember the guy that brought it in said he’d been towing his caravan and mistakenly left it in drive 2, hence a rod exiting the block. It was an injection version with that lovely plenum chamber hanging over the marvellous cologne motor.
Omg please learn how to wash a car! You don't just spray directly on to a car like that with such a dirt layer!
Yes. They were just phasing 5* out. I am not speaking of the Pearson family. That happened ten years later. The local FORD dealer, Page Motors in East Street, Epsom Surrey seemed to have connections. They were the first in the area to have the biggest badest FORDS of the era. The Capri 3.0s and later 2.8i, countles RS's, Escort Cosworth. the Chasseur was seen there as well as a Tickford Capri. I remember looking at the Chasseur and thinking how regal it looked. I now remember thinking as a 14 year olde, 'It looks better than a Range Rover'. The decal reminds me of the sport activities seen on the first generation TV games of the time...........Now look where we are :-/  Fantastic show as always Jonny. Stay safe.
I sold one of these fabulous Chasseurs new in July 1980 when I was working in the Ford network. It was Roman Bronze over Tuscan Beige from memory with gold tinted wheels. It also had four luggage cases in the boot area. It was £14400 from memory and was at the time, the most expensive car the dealership had sold.
My crusader estate is black bumpers window trims brown and gold most expensive coulor combo now done 52k 20 pinto fantastic quiet engine  iv done 4k in 10 year spare wheel never used
Could you follow this car I seem to remember the 1980 cortina as a chasseau
My dear stepfather had a 3ltr Granada estate  auto  ,s uch a lovely car to drive long distance and so big and comfortable
uncanny - my grandad's red Vauxhall Viva was YCH711M . . .
Jonny  Didn’t they Ford make a Cortina with the exact same decals ? Seem to remember seeing one when I was a kid 👍🏻
Great chanel. Barn finds especially. always look forward to them.what a rare car to find and in great condition  it's been loved you can see that.can you not do a follow up with it cleaned up looking like new. And driving 🚘 😉
I've been squirreling my 2004 VW Passat 1.8T Wagon away as a project/special days. Less than 7800 made worldwide even smaller portion came to the states here. It's a GL with everything the GLS has Sept the Moon Roof. It's a 5-Speed manual and it has the Four Motion (All wheel drive witchcraft) and it's in pretty great shape being the 3rd owner. 2nd was my xwife who I taught how to drive a manual. But I love my, "Granny Sleeper". I use a 05' Trailblazer EXT LT (V8) that seats 7 and has the All wheel and 4x4 options as my daily driver. Living in Wisconsin more than just 2 wheel drive is important to have.
Great video had to watch it till the end, I grew up with these cars so it's great to see this type of video rather than the usual thrashing of a supercar, boring.
I have not read all the comments so someone else may have mentioned this, on air con models I think the blue and red slider colours may have been green and red ? i think you actually had to pull the rotary switch out to turn the air con on, bear in mind it was basic air con and not climate control .Myself, my brother and my father had about 16 Granada between us many years ago over a period of time, Dads were nearly new and new whereas ours were all used models
Mmmm chicken tonight
I travelled in one around ‘81!
the "fast back coupe" was the best Granada,
ive never felt as connected while wathcing a video on youtube, i remember stood up in the back of my dads as a kid holding onto the headrest posts while we drove down blackpool lights... absolute beautiful car jonny that you need to buy! ;)
Awesome Granada's.my mates dad had a metallic blue 2.8 giha X estate.for the time it was the bees knees.
If you like old Ford station wagons you should go to Australia to pick up a falcon station wagon, they were so popular back then and tonnes of room at the back mate!:)
Am I correct in thinking they did a limited edition cortina with the same name as I remember working on one in the late 80s
Please may I say these four simple words !!!  Please buy it Jonny 🙌🙌🙌
I'd love to know when and where this goes up for sale. Incredible video, incredible car. Lovely stuff as always sir!
Turn the music off, its the car we want to hear!
Beautiful, let's hope it stays out of the greasy hands of the banger racing mob.
The metric tires are available from Coker Tire, but there are also inch-size wheels (and full covers!) in that size.
Hi Jonny. I had not heard of this model, but there was a similar estate  model in those colours called the Sportsman that looked just as nice.
Amazed its survived in such good condition, V and W reg were terrible years for rot.
did you buy it?
Nice condition. These estates were before Mini Vans came along. Cars in storage a long time tend to disolve without use. weird electrical faults, gas and brake lines rust away. Gas tanks leak. Would it pass an MOT?
Please could you do a follow up episode where Dave is taught how to wear trousers?
You can't love cars and not love this. Great work!
How lovely. I used to walk past one of these on my way to school in around 1980/81, I could probably identify the exact parking space still! I used to think that the sports decal had something to do with the game selections on a TV game, they used to use very similar icons.
1980 Olympics, if I remember correctly the USA team boycotted the games. Ford would have loved that but maybe Ford Europe boycotted whatever Ford USA said! Keep up the good work.
Hi, I did sell one of these new in I think 1980 whilst working for Dees of Sidcup, it was to a guy who had recently won on the pools. This was the only one we had for sale, and the sales manager was pleased it went!
I dream of finding something interesting lurking away, unloved in a garage & digging it out like this.
Went to the car auction at Bellevue Manchester in the 80s with a disabled mate, we passed in a metallic blue chasseur because it was a manual! Must have been even rarer than that one.
I'd pay £300 for those luggage bags.
I remember going to Prescott Motors back in the 80s with my Dad and he would always look at MK2 Granadas , may have even looked at that very one ! .Really enjoyed the film , wouldn't mind it myself.
I am amazed there any Grannies left.They are still appearing at banger racing circuits.Must have made a hell of alot.
My dad had the ford consul version very rare with  a 2.5 V6
An 8 year old battery is always gonna be dead.. I revived my grandads car after it sat for 3 years and I swapped the battery straight away after draining the fuel tank
I never thought I'd say this about a Ford Granada but that it one BEAUTIFUL car...
I love this era of Fords the Granada was so posh, family had a Ford dealer, have stacks of Ford stuff hidden away, I loved my dads Gplate Scorpio was so posh!  What a lovely story and lady!!
Wow, took me right back, my dad had the 80's Granada estate too, not this model though. Thanks Jonny for sharing. You have to buy it for the channel and do a rolling resto on it! 🙏
I understand that this was a car that not a lot of people had. But it really wasn't that special. It wasn't anything people dreamed about compared to say a Capri or even the Granada he drove up in. This is a mom's car. It's a family estate with some extra options and that's it. No the color isn't wonderful. It's one of the things that was terrible about the 70's and 80's. (I was there I lived it). This is an American Escort. That's it. It's not even a Manual trans. I LOVE the European Cortina's and Capri's of the early 70's. I had two 73 imported "Mercury Capri's" when I was 17 years old and they were AWESOME little cars. They were what turned me into a small sporty car fanatic. But THIS? This isn't anything special I'm sorry. It's just not. It's a rebranded housewife's 80's Mini Van. In the USA the Granada came with a V8 and could even be gotten with a Manual trans. (It rarely did mind you LOL. But it was a HORRIBLE car. I see how it's a statement of it's time now and rings through the memory bank of emotions of my youth. But I NEVER WANTED ONE LOL.
You know you need it .get the body repairs done then get the ceramic protection like the jimny  done ✔   great video
I remember these from my childhood. A family in my street had one and I remember seeing it fully loaded for their annual holiday. Great cars!
What a beauty and a credit to its owner. I had mk2 Granada in 2 tone graphite grey over silver, it was amazing and I loved it dearly. Still one of the best cars I ever owned. Thanks for showing us this, it brought back some very happy memories.
Not hear that saying for years “look after it and it will look after you “!! Made me 😂 not my sort of car but can imagine it’s a lot of people childhood memories. Another great video keep it up boys . Shame there are not more of this on tv people love it shame it’s not more Main Stream .
Brilliant garage find,we've always had a soft spot for Fords,i had a MK2 2.8 Ghia,dad had a gold MK 2 2.0 litre and my brother loved his Capri 2.0 litre S. What a lovely car that Chasseur is dripping with memories.
A really nice bit of TV
Browner than Bobby Sands' bedroom...!   Yeuk!
I owned a car sales business many years ago and specialise in just Granadas over approximately 10 years I must’ve sold some 2/3000 of these cars absolutely unique vehicles and during that time I had three Chasseurs only one had  its luggage
Getting Sweeney-sque vibes Jonny...
Great video. So many memories,my dad had a Granada and I had a leaky Consul.
When you see an old car such as this, partly it’s a great blast from the past, but it’s also a reminder of just how much unburnt fuel and toxins tumble out of that tailpipe! We should indeed retain examples of these old estates as with all models that constitute our motoring history. I’m 74 now and have breathed more than my share of these fumes as we knew no better! But we do know now! Times change and we have to embrace the soulless present and future too! Sorry all, but a sad fact of life...cheers!
My dad had one of these, he called it 'the sport biscuit'
We’re the Sweeney and we haven’t had any dinner.
I was a mechanic at a Ford Dealer in Birmingham and PDI   2 of these  Models. They were to celebrate Olympics . Remember them as they stood out. Had lots of looks during road be test.
I remember seeing a few trundling around Devon & Cornwall when making van deliveries, though it might have been just the one getting everywhere. For me Estates are better at driving loads around. Had a SUV but my Skoda estate is a no going back car.
Hi Jonny.  I remember these coming out when I used to live in Essex in 1980 and someone did own one locally.  It was an impressive car for its time!  I could not work out why it was called a shoe in French at the time 😂!  I later found out that it  means Sportsman!  I also remember Ford did another limited run 2-tone blue and silver Granada called a Sapphire but I am not sure if it was available as an estate (or Station Wagon as we call it in NZ.) Finally,  the company I used to work for in the city back then had a chaffeur driven Mk3 Ghia X estate in black.  That really looked the business!  Hope you take this car on!
That’s so nice
I can see Jonny cruising around in this with a twill cap
👍🏼😎🇦🇺
Would you rehome it to a caring home in New Zealand?
David Attenborough of car world.
Hi Jonny, our local Sony Dealer owner Mr Lennox of East Kilbride had one of these. I always called it the Granada Sportsman as I never knew it was known as the Chasseur.
I remember the idea of Brown Interiors.  Some journo in the 70's declared that brown interiors produced the best Audio Response. Hahahaa.
HOW MANY TIMES JONNY!!!!>???? If you are starting a car that has sat for 10 years you need to FOG THE BORES.....FOG EVERYTHING!!! WITH OIL!!! If you are doing it fine, Show us...it saves all of us groaning when you just chuck a bunch of petrol in the carb and crank it. You did the same thing with the Mercedes...and it sounded like you seized it?  Like the show....tho this is painful to watch.
Wonderful stuff!
You love to drag things out, hey? FFS Johnny , get on with it, get her going!
the audio is fuked
Hi Jonny this is yet another fantastic barn/garage find video thank you. I do love a Mk2 Granada and the estate Is massive. I had never heard of a Granada Chasseur I'm ashamed to say being an absolute classic ford fanatic. But I do know the Sierra Chasseur which was one of the special edition run out models alongside the Azura. I'm sure I've seen a Mk1 Fiesta in this Granada's colour scheme maybe a similar special edition. This Granada reminds me of a bigger Cortina Huntsman edition. I do hope this Granada goes to the right person, I would have it if I had the room. I love Roman Bronze it's a lovely colour and that Brown check interior is to die for, it looks mint. 👍
Most of these have died on the banger racing tracks and they still are every weekend. Good to see there are still a few left.
i hada mk2 metro gta and the 13 185 ruber cost loads
That is a real find. Go on jonny, buy it. You know that is a great rare car which needs a good home.
How lovely to see this car again. I remember in 1981 having a paper round just outside Swindon and one of my customers having taken delivery of one of these cars. I remember the first time I walked up the driveway and saw it parked there and was blown away. The guy who owned it was pretty well off and the sort of guy who had a fancy reel to reel stereo in his hallway. They must have been pretty pricey and appealing to the trendy family man. I would have this in a heartbeat!
Wow just hearing it lovely i had mk2 ghia x 28 on carbs best engine ever brilliant miss then it was my first car wish i kept it but was to big and juice  on fuel 20 years ago great stuff jonny buy it.
Old enough to have seen the Ford Granda on television from 70's onwards. It was always the bosses car. Regan in the Sweeney , George had the Cortina. Cowley had a dark red and black car in the Professionals whilst Bodie had a Capri and Doyle in early series had the Mk2 Escort RS 2000 (which I must admit preferred over the Capri, still have the Matchbox car. He then got a Capri Then in Dempsey and Makepeace Spiking had a face-lifted Mk2 looked like saloon version of your dad's in the picture. Makepeace had a Mk3 RS 2000 cabriolet Never seen a Granda like that,  great stuff 👌
Such an amazingly well preserved piece of history. Makes brown look great!
What a lovely example of this rare model. I Have fond memories of these.. My father was a huge Ford fan of the  Era 2.8i Granada saloon in Jupiter red Mk4 2.0 Ghia Cortina in the same jupiter red. Mk 1 Essex v6 Granada Ghia. The fond memories continue as we lived at the time near a dealership (Gates of Harlow) and I can remember seeing a chasseur in the showroom. Brilliant blog Jonny keep up the good work mate👍
What a great looking Granny. Funny what time does. Shame so many got used for banger racing. You'd be foolish to miss out on that, it looks pretty special.
There’s the sound of my childhood, cranking over on the driveway. Fantastic video 😊😊
The mileage isn’t genuine, looking at the MOT history it was on 49,999 from 2006 - 2010 then in 2011 it was on 49,990  it still won’t be much higher than 55,000 if that.  Well worth buying to restore and cherish,  I personally would love to own it.
Yes fine big motor had the GL version of that car same color loved driving it. It just got to the stage where it was at the end of its useful life would have cost to much to fix it up.  I sold it to a mate of mine he just wanted to trash it sent it to the scrap yard back then we just didn't care about them as much. I never saw that kind off model great find 😀👍
What a great video, loved it and hearing the story, these are some of my favourite films you do. Keep up the good work Jonny!
Interesting that old ad. They filmed in Germany
I can remember a local lady had a Cortina Carousel  Estate in a very similar colour scheme. Think that was only based on the L though.
Just love this channel, the production quality is just another level and a pleasure to watch, thanks Johnny and gang👍
👍
I used to plague the local Ford dealer in Edinburgh every month in the late 70’s when I was about 10 and get the latest ‘Ford Cars’ brochure. Still have a bunch of them. I had the Granada Chasseur fold out brochure on my wall for a while alongside the Capri brochure that folded out to become a  poster of an Oyster Gold Capri Ghia - my Dad had a 3.0 litre version of that exact car, absolutely brilliant.
"...changing the batteries"  Aww, bless.
It probably started once it'd dried out from the flooding you gave it with way too much neat petrol down the carb.  Like watching two amateurs at work.  Sorry.  Un-subscribed.
Ooooooh sweet! A Granny mk2 estate! This was just about my favourite car when I was a nipper in the late 70s and early 80s…….personally I loved the 2.8i estate, but that Chasseur is epic - bronze, beige and gold ahoy!
I remember somebody owned one of these round the corner from me. The colour scheme and those decals were proper distinctive. Love it!
Love those old adverts being inserted like that , the voices and music from my childhood TV 💕
Hi Jonny – you mentioned if you remember the Chasseur… I do. The love started in 1979, 7 years of age and my Uncle pulling up in a ’79 Midnight Blue 2.0L. I always wanted the silver on blue Sapphire – later years, I ended up with a lovely 2.8 Ghia ’79.  From that day in ’79 I have collected car brochures and do have one detailing the Chasseur, always wanted to see the luggage! Incredible – True Ford Fan, in fact I think at MPR you may(?) have seen of my Regency Green, chocolate brown interior Fiesta 1.3 Ghia.
Chasseur was a run out special before the facelift was it not? Proper car.
9:50 ahh the orange peel paint finish option. My new Orion 1.6i Ghia had that fitted.....
I remember the Chasseur but haven't seen one for years. Reminds me of the old boy next door, he had a light green 2.3 estate. Kept in similar condition but that was a long time ago.
Thank you  -more please
What a sweetie an absolute darling........PS buy yourself a Snap on Jump Pack !
I had a V Reg Granada 2.8 on TRX Wheels in the 80’s the tyres then were around £50 each, I bought partly used at £20 each.
Nice video Jonny.  A Chasseur was the first car that came to my mind when you said a rare special edition Granada.  As a kid in 1980 my neighbour bought one new.  A distinctive car at the time but I thought the gold MKII Granada 2.8 Ghia saloon it replaced was a classier.
I can't see any of today's cars. Still on the road. Able to run. Able to start. And have the same effect on people after 41 years as these old beast do. And many others like it
That is in great nick for a Ford of that era, they're terrible for rust and falling apart. The interior looks mint.
😍  Brilliant
You need to buy it or show its selling progress whether its auction or private sale.
Go on, buy it 👍🏻😝
Jonny since you washed it,  you have to buy it.
This brings back memories, in the early nineties I owned a silver non running Broadspeed twin turbo Granada. Unfortunately it was stored on my friend’s dad’s land until he got fed up with seeing it and called in the scrap man. RIP, FLY 2T.
Excellent video Jonny
Stamford, Lincolnshire 1980, my first and only memory of the Granada Chasseur.    Jessups now I think called TC Harrison, was a Ford dealer on Wharf Road and as a boy of 9 I would haunt the showroom getting brochures, spotting the first August 1st number plates etc.     They had a gleaming bronze Chasseur in the showroom.  I was smitten.  It knocked our bright orange Chrysler Horizon out of the park!  The salesman bought my story that I wanted a brochure for my Dad who I was sure (in my dreams) would buy the Chasseur on the spot.  Could I sit in it? Yes.  Could I perhaps experience the luxury of the electric windows?  The salesman got the keys, told me to make sure it was in Park, and then let me fire up the Cologne? V6 before I spent a minute playing with the windows .  My Dad never did buy the Chasseur. Years later he did come close to buying the aerodynamic Mk3 Granada  when they first came out but by then he was a confirmed Volvo 700 series owner.    Jonny, your video transported me back to a very happy childhood memory.  Cheers mate!   .
I don’t know what year that is but it looks nothing like the ‘75 Ford Granada I had here in the states!
Brings back memories of the early 80s. Gotta follow this up jonny
The model was based on a German special which had provision for a leather pouch to carry a hunting rifle hence the name. It was built in Cologne. The car is missing rear overriders, the fixing bolts are visible but the PU mouldings have torn off, otherwise in great shape. The bumpers are certainly ‘dainty’ , the facelift had big chromed bars and rubbing strips but not on Chasseur. The similarity of the Australian model is not a coincidence, the Designer was the same and a group of engineers went from Ford Dunton to Melbourne to assist the local team on doors, hoods, boots etc but based on the US model. 500 sounds about right, it was special with black door frame cappings etc apart from the bespoke luggage furniture.
Fab love it !
You've got to buy it and you  should do more features on old granadas. There's alot of interest out there. Anyone calling themselves a ford fanatic and  doesn't know about the granada  Chasseur can't call themselves a ford fanatic mind you alot of so called ford fanatics just think it's all about mk1 and mk2 escorts.
As a kid with a Ford brochure that was my exact dream car for a while and seemed impossibly more exotic than the Prairie Yellow 1.3L Mk3 Escort we had just bought (though that did have a sunroof!).
Hows your new car Jonny?  looks great, sounds great too
I’m so pleased that I contacted Jonny about this car on behalf of my friend Lyn. The video captures the day perfectly. This was a whole days work and the team were obviously true enthusiasts engrossed in not only the Granada but it’s history and meaning for the family. This has given them happy memories to look back on. Thanks Jonny for a great day!
I actually worked on one of those in the 1980s at a Ford dealership in Germany. I always loved it, it was very special backnthen!
BUY it now Jonny! Awesome 👍
You have to buy that Jonny it’s lush
I love seeing these old cars being brought back to life and started
Business at the front, weekend at the back…. I bet Ford Europe’s marketing team had mullets. Car is incredible.
What a lovely car I had a metallic blue one great for holidays and I had a camping trailer I loved it 👍
Looking forward to the launch
What was the date on the milk bottle?
I’m not really a Ford guy I’m into W124 wagons..but this I like ..I like a lot ..great find .
That is just crazy
I think I've literally driven modern cars in worse condition :)
An isn't she a beauty sweet lad 💯💪
True petrol heads
Starting that brought back memories of my old MK3 Cortina many years ago - cold winters morning, crossing your fingers that it would actually start before the battery gave up completely! I seem to remember that I somehow learned that if I stuck my comb in the top of the webber carb it would hold the choke plates right in the sweet spot for guaranteed cold starting. Ah, the joy of motoring back then. With regard the Granada, great to see that rare MK2 in such fantastic condition, a real testiment to how the owner loved and cared for it. But to be totally honest, my eyes lit up the most when I saw you driving that MK1 at the beginning. Brought back so many memories of when my brother had an identical, but right hand drive car. After being used to being driven around in my dads old Austin1300, the Granada seemed like a dream machine. I remember sitting in the back being pushed back into the seat when my brother floored it. Just so quiet, comfortable and powerful compared to most other cars on the road at the time.
Geez... seems they'd  build a garage a couple feet bigger I mean how much more could it cost?
Think I nearly cried , willing the car to come back to life, those V6 units were great, still are 👍😋
Had a look at the MOT history. All 6 of the MOTs shown on there show the car being at the same mileage for each test  - 49999. This means that it was probably taken on a flat-bed to the test centre each time. Crazy stuff! Lovely find, Jonny!
The estate lacks the elegance of the saloon
great video.    How to price such a car?    Maybe for me, £4,000. Would be fun to take the family out during the weekend with the bikes attached.  What would you guys pay?
A great example of a fantastic vehicle. Loved my old one. Hats off to the previous owner for keeping it in this sort of condition.
A video wheee you see more of the hedge and not the entire car!
I love an old Classic especially an old Granny but the clock is ticking to  to "E day" Tuesday, 1 January 2030 when you wont be able to buy a new petrol or diesel car , Sure there be loads to buy second hand but what lies in store for High emission Classics , Does anyone believe the ULIZ will stay only around the North Circular in London ?  I hope I'm so so wrong but I can see the government  expanding ULIZ around the M25  then to every town and city eventually  lets hope I'm wrong as that could mean by that time anyone owning a 50s 60s,70,  Classic from a Moggy to a Beetle from a Granada to a Etype will either have to pay the best part of 20 quid a day to move their car from their drive or pay 1000s of pounds for a E conversion .
Awesome. Old school cars are the best.
Nice car.   But needs used or on Display in a Museum.    But not just returned to the garage.
I think I’ve still got the original sales brochure for that car, it was a childhood hobby of mine collecting them, got hundreds more of other cars from the 70’s/80’ too 🤣
I have the brochure on this car in my attic, a fantastic find
Jonny buy that legendary estate
Oh this is just brilliant!!
My dad had a serria estate and it got stolen for a bank robbery I've found the barrel for it 10 years later in the grass
What a beauty!! How many cars have fitted luggage from the factory! 😍 enjoyed watching you rub down a granny with soapy water 🤣  So what did Mrs CP say when you bought it? 😉
My dad had ghia x number plate HPP1Y
My next door neighbour had one. I remember him proudly telling my dad it was a chasseur
Absolutely, flippin loved this episode. Love the barn finds.
Wheatley guarge had one for sale I thought about buying one . Lighter brown cases
Loved that! Thanks Jonny! 👍🏻
Oy look! It's the Ford Granddada!
Did it come with leather cases in the back
You have to buy this ole girl Jonny!
Brought back so many memories going on holiday in my nan and grandads granada there's was gold then later had a red with vinyl roof, thanks for sharing this one, 👍
I remember the Chasseur I was working for Ford dealers around that time, they looked really good when new, always liked the Granada estates. I had a MK1 Consul GT estate, I was not aware they built a GT estate,  (I also had a MK2 Cortina GT estate, they were special order) the Consul may have been a special build as the first owner  was Ford Motor Co, I understand it had been a rally support car, it had several bolt holes in the roof where a large roof rack had been fitted I assumed. It had a 3 litre engine with a manual gearbox and power steering, Imola blue. It was very quick for the time.
Looks like an Aussie ford XD falcon and a ford cortina had a hot date with no protection.
What a find.. I would love to see a proper detail clean video to reveal its true glory.
Looks a lot like 1979 Ford Falcon (Australian) These were a bit wider and maybe a bit longer and came with 4 engine choices, 3 .3 or 4.1 liter 6 cylinder OHV engine, and a 5 or 5.8 liter Cleveland V8
The sound of my childhood at 22:22 as an old carburetor Ford engine struggles to turn over
What a beauty. Proper 80s estate
My Dad had a mk1 and a mk2 as company cars, I felt like a king at the time. Ford absolutely had cars nailed in the 70s and 80s , surely the best time for them.  I had two mk3s myself. As soon as the blob eye Scorpio and mondeo turned up I lost interest in Fords.
Not sure why they didn't just take a new or decent battery for the car rather than using jump packs and jump batteries. It cut out at the end because it was just the alternator keeping the car running but the voltage spikes would have been horrendous for the 40 year old electrics ☹️
Like so many others I spent my childhood in the back of Ford Granadas and Cortinas in the 70's.   Got to love that car.
What a brilliant episode, best one to date. Wouldn’t it e great if  you and Edd China teamed up to turn around some of these barn finds!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Fantastic find! We always used to call this model 'The Sportsman' My neighbour owned 3 Granada's over the years and always wanted one of these...
They also did an Olympics themed fiesta 1.4 Olympus sport
Definitely a really distinctive special edition.  Looks like a 7/8ths scale XD Falcon wagon from Aussieland, 1979 to 1981 model !!
Jonny, we need a Allegro update!!!!!
A proper estate car, not like the estate cars of today which are really just extended by 6" hatchbacks. Bring back memories of the Cortina estates that dad hired back in the 80s to go on holiday in.
One of my favourite memories of childhood is how ‘80s cars smelt when they’d been in a garage for a while - a mix of petrol and vinyl. I don’t care if that makes me weird - but I have a feeling I’m not alone.  Car names always make me smile - ‘chasseur’ being the French word for ‘Hunter’, you can imagine Ford wanting it to evoke imagery of an Olympian shooting skeet or something, but for me, it just makes me think of chicken.
Old ford's or any car from the 80s..bring soooo much good memories 2 me, ford capri was my dad's we loved it, just puts a smile on my face when I see these cars ...u av 2 buy it Johnny u av 2..don't miss ya chance you'll only regret it pal..
I love it , it is absolutely amazing  All it needs is a wash a good polish and it will look like new 😍😍👍👍
Forget yoga or meditation classes, just watch Jonny caress, wash and whisper to a barn find. Absolutely awesome, thanks.
The early 80’s and the love of brown and beige…. That period for Ford was quite unusual… remember in the brochures you could enquire about a US Mustang or an  Australian model similar to the Granada? The name if which escapes me.
I wouldn't have revved it like that
What a great video Johnny put a smile on my face to watch this from start to finish. I real sleeping beauty. Absolute credit to the original owner and what a great story behind the purpose of the cars life. Let’s hope there are loads more out there like this. 👍😊
Lovely old beauty
i have said it before, but this simple youtube show is the best motoring tv show around... you can tell that Johnny has a real passion for cars...
Wow!!! My dad had that exact model!!!!   Awesome
Looks a bit bigger then the Cortina's, and a fair bit smaller then the XD/XE/XF Falcon we got Down Under. The XD Falcon Station Wagon, was huuuge, it's a shame we never got a 2-door version like the Granada had. Someone with a race team needs to buy this example, so it can go to Goodwood towing a mid sixties formula car.
I have worked for a number of Ford dealers over the years, I was told by someone that the UK military used to like the MK 2 Granada saloon because the top brass could wear their caps while seated in the back, and Ford lost the contract when they introduced the Scorpio replacement because they were no longer able to do this and switched to Volvo instead. Has anyone else heard of this?  There used to be so many Granada Ghia Sapphires about with the two tone midnight blue/stratos silver paint work, another colour they looked good in was Apollo Green.
Bronze Medal 🥉 Brown. The official color of the 70s and early 80s.  What an absolute time capsule of a car. Just as desired as finding a near perfect Cobra.  BUY IT Jonny!!! You'll regret it if you don't.
Find someone who sings your praises like Jonny does an old barn find.
:( Pull your pants up
You need to save it Johnny,  I remember the Granada Chassuer and it was mainly because of that sticker with the matchstick sportsmen , it brings back so many memories 😁 you know you wanna save it
I remember this car from when i was a kid. I was 10 years old i have love watching this one guys👍😎
Another great episode. Made me strangely nostalgic for my old Volvo 850 estate. Miss that car.
I remember my mum's cousin had an estate version Ghia x 2.8? In the same colour and it had a trip computer I thought that was amazing. I think it gave a digital display with distance and fuel consumption. Awesome estate and always loved being given a lift. Those were days of our Ford fiesta mk1 HYP174W.
What a beauty - absolute classic.
This car without absolute doubt needs to head straight to the Jonny Smith collection. I remember these when brand new -  they are perhaps the ultimate statement of what a special edition used to be. I used to get my father to take me to all my local dealerships when I was 9 years old - one of the these was proudly displayed bang slap centre in my local ford showroom. Needs to be driven with 'Einstein a go go' by landscape playing on full blast out of the radio cassette. Its totally early 80s tastic!! 🙂🙂👍👍
Oh how I loved my Mark II... even though running it nearly broke my finances forever!
“Brown and Tartan” sounds like a Scottish Gay Club!
I am interested in buying.how and who do I contact thanks
Pure love this motor!
It’s in good condition and I don’t make cars like that anymore duvet pretty nice now I’d buy that if I was you
GREAT VIDEO thanks for the effort Regards
Jonny - you got to buy it
Great work lads, this old girl deserves to live on for a few more  years.
Memories of the first car I ever drove solo at aged 12, my late dad throwing me the keys betting I couldn’t drive the red 2.3 L estate manual beast… his face was a picture when I took off round the caravan park field we were staying at! Absolutely love this episode I’ll be showing my mum! Buy the car Johnny!
Can we PLEASE bring back tartan interiors!! 😍
One used to run around Chester in the 80s
Lovely Jonny liked the Mk 1 Granada at the start wow a rare estate Mk 2 Granada Chasseur great history about the car👍👍👍
Looking at its MOT history it looks like its odometer is broken. It's been at 49,999 miles for years.
Great to see the Barn Find Fleece in full flow.
Chasseur means it's a shooting brake I guess, re the French for hunting
Superb.  Great to see such a rare beast brought back to life.  Exactly the kind of content I love.  A definite contender for purchase, would love to see more of this clearly cherished motor!
thumbs up for dave's fine ass
Amazing vid
What a stunning car and a great piece of film making.
It's a museum piece really. Rare as hell.
Ah a Dagenham special, they sure don’t make them like that anymore
Rear light lenses with 2 screws, so you can change a bulb in 2 minutes, oh how motoring has improved since the dark 80/90s.....
Dear Jonny, Half way through listening to the Smith and Sniff podcast,this morning, where  both you and Richard mentioned a rare barn find Granada, I instantly switched to watching this YT vid. Cutting to to the chase, I owned two Chasseurs at the same time in the 1990's. They are luxury road boats that can swallow whales and Victorian roll top baths when the back seats are folded down. Yes there were only 500 made 👍🏻
On another level of cool. 😍 have to love an old Mk2
That interior looks brand new
Named after the popular 70s chicken dish! Hence the hunting/country sports logo and hunter spec colours and accessories.
TRX tyres.....the worst ever!
I love those old Ford's. I grew up in Cortina's, my Dad gave me his MkV when he "upgraded" to a Toyota Carina. It had the same steering wheel as that Granada. Good memories.
I had the 2 tone 2.8i Ghia Saloon. Loved it
We need to see this beauty up and about
My dad used to own an ex Australian embassy armour plated Granada. What a beast it was!
Go on jonny you have to buy it, if you dont i will 😂
what a nice peace of history thanks for showing us this johnny
Please please please be very careful who you decide to sell this car to as there are banger drivers that would pay very strong money for this to take it round the track ...I so hope this goes to an enthusiast who will love it and bring it up to its deserved condition rare as hens teeth
I have a Mk2 Escort 2door popular in Roman Bronze and I love it,  tan vinal interior 1977 1100cc magic, that Granada is an absolute Gem you need to buy it Johnny
What a lovely example, and very rare nowadays too. Buy it jonny .🙂👍
24:50 Greta wouldn't like that.
This needs to be yours Jonny👌
Great film JS , could almost call it  romantic. The temptation must be to buy all the barn finds but this Granada could have a great future story for us to watch. Love it
Buy it Jonny! 👍
I remember the Granada Chasseur from my youth, soon as I saw the two tone brown I knew it. On seeing the red and green buttons of the  fob brought back other memories of the cheapo alarm, 13 quid from Maccess  (auto parts cash & carry).  Actually, that'd worry me as if that alarm  is fitted, I wonder what other parts are fitted from the same shop - the ball joints and other suspension parts I got from there were seemingly made from cheese.  On the plus side they were very cheap.
Love it. My childhood reliving.... Asante from kenya
My dad had a silver granny same shape as that 2.8ghiax
What a beauty. Where would you find another like it🤔. Buy it
When I was a mechanic at a Ford Dealership, my managing director had the exact same chasseur except it was fuel injected, he was waiting to do a U-turn on a dual carriageway and he was rear ended. It ended up getting re-shelled which I was given the job of swapping all the parts over from the wrecked shell (back in the days when a re-shell was cost effective).
Great example 👍
Hi Jonny, WOW what a pleasure to see one off these again. I purchased one back in 1998/99 with a sheared fly wheel, i remember i paid £350 for the car.
Proper limited editions…. I loathe the current rash of ‘limited edition’ Corsas and Astras of which limited numbers are 3 million. And it is a true limited edition. What a glorious, beautiful car - my grandad had a few Granada GXLs/Ghias when we lived in South Africa, although the engines were 3.0s rather than 2.8s over there due to the hotter climate. These old Fords have just so much character and appeal. I really felt rather emotional and won’t lie - I shed a tiny tear when she finally coughed into life! A wonderful video Jonny.
This is content.  Love it.
Wow, fantastic. I had a 1980 W reg white Ghia estate for 5 years..it is now in the loving care of another enthusiast. Great cars.. Chasseur mega rare
Wow, that brought back some memories. As soon as you opened that garage door and I saw the two tone paint, the word “Chasseur” came to mind. My god father used to have one & used it for towing his caravan too. My dad had the Granada Ghia, also used for caravan duties lol. I’ve no doubt got photos somewhere of both our families on tour. Incidentally, the first car I owned was a Mk2 Cortina that my dad & I rebuilt …. I had it painted Roman Bronze as I liked the Chasseur so much. Happy days!
Always love your videos but I would never ever get an old car. Too much dust for me haha.
What an icon always wanted a Granada l would love to restore it 👍
Being an older git, I do remember the Granada Chasseur coming out. It was highly fancied but far more than I could afford. Wonderful to see one again, still highly fanciable and a very practicable luxury estate. Someone out there will pay good money for it now and it will prove to be a fantastic investment. Thank for showing it.
My dad changed his Granada estate for Rover SD1 ....the Rover looked from a different age, but was incredibly unreliable, the Granada did 80.000 miles and never missed a beat
After Party Car....Complete 🔊🔊
this is brilliant
Top car love the look of it. U should buy it and keep it running👊👍✋
What a car! such a great video! I thought you'd be interested even before you said it will be for sale :-)
This looks very similar to an XD Ford Flacon from Australia, but over here there were a number of engine options, i can't remember if there was a 3.3ltr straight 6, but there was a 4.1ltr straight 6, and two V8s, 49ltr and 5.8ltr. This looks like about the level of a Fairmont or Fairmont Ghia in terms of features. The headlights and front indicators look to be pretty near identical.
Bloody loved this, my first car was a “Roman bronze” mk4 Cortina
Very rare Granada fantastic find
What a find!  Lovely car and a great video!
What a great car
What a special car. I seem to recall seeing the logo but am not sure.... Dad had a 2.8Ghia
Back in the 80's my Pop had a 80 Granada Ghia 2.8 and I had a 79 Cortina 2.0 GL Ghia Estate. I miss those cars but not the fuel consumption..
If it has AC you'd pull the fan speed  rotary switch out to turn it on. Loved both my MKII's first was a 1982 imperial red I think it was  called 2.8i Ghia x auto saloon with the front air damn and rear spoiler.  Then an 84 Silver over blue 2.8i Ghia x  manual estate.
What a superb example Jonny. Always wanted a Granada, but my job grade within my company in the early 80’s precluded me having one! I eventually got a Ford Scorpio in 1995, albeit a 2.0 auto. Very ugly car, but an effortless, spacious cruiser, put 120,000 miles on it in 3 years! I remember driving one of our Director’s 2.8i Ghia in 1983, had to drop him off in London and  drive the car back to HO in Wolverhampton. Memorable drive 😎🇬🇧👍
Please buy it this car is a gem
Early to mid 90's had a silvermetallic 2,8 1982 that was manual 4-speed and it absoluteley loved petrol! Maybe due to trying to reach valvebounce at the edge of 8000rpm in all gears, which it managed in first at 59-60 and second at 83-84mph. Yes it was mean to the V6 but only happened once or twice, and only when fully warmed up. Comfy like nothing else. Luckily it didnt have TRX wheels as those tyres where EXPENSIVE AS H... At the time really posh versions of cars had TRX like SAAB 900 Turbo and the fastest versions of Citroen CX
That music is pretty annoying
Great find and what a classic Ford
Love the barn finds, especially when it turns out like this. Would love to see this driving and towing again. Excellent.
Great video as alway what a great looking car
10:00 when i say that i get arrested
Someone buy this car, give it a wash and recommission, and enjoy it!!! Beautiful car
What a car!!!!!!
Had 3 mk2's 2 saloons and an estate if I could afford it I'd buy it such a lovely car, currently trying to sort out an old Vitara Fatboy and restoring a Merlin Magic so funds don't allow  you'd be mad not to buy it if you don't still have a Granny though Jonny.
A school friends Dad had that model new in the 1980's & he loved it.
I knew they existed, I hadn't seen them in real life.
Magnificent, I'd buy in a heartbeat.
Car pervert you will cream ur pants when you get a sniff of the SD1 V8 Manual on eBay  It's lovely but not sure about the kit
Seen a couple of Mk2 Granada two doors. Never knew they existed until I saw one on the road.
A Cologne V6 will Always Start & Run Smooth as Silk.  Fantastic Engines.  & The Granada Ride Quality Is One on the Best cars i Have Ever Driven.   Mum & Dad went away on Holiday, on Return There was a Granny 2.8 Ghia in Caspian Blue with Blue & White Houndstooth Velour interior. The Whole car was 100% Mint Condition. AS NEW.  A Little Prezzie for Mum & Dad. ( they Paid me For it & LOVED it BIG TIME. )  It was a one or Two owner from new car. All Original, Never had any Paint. & Full Paperwork to Back up the Low Mileage, Once again Only Used a a Caravan Tow car. Supplying Dealer Stickers Key fobs, & Number plates etc. As Expected.  Everything I Expect to See when i Pay money for a Quality Mint car.   To Match the Quality of the Granada & Cortina V6's I Finally Ended up With a BMW e34 525i SE.  Nothing Else comes Close to Granada Ride Quality & Silky Smooth 6 cyl engine.   The BMW e34  5 Series has the Ride Almost ? But Will Wipe the Floor & Clean UP on Granny Performance & Handling.  & Still WAFT ALONG LIKE a LIMO'   mum Loves BMW e34's. Sadly Dad is no longer here to Enjoy them.  Even Mum Loves the Performance & road holding & Near silent WAFTING Ride.   You DO NOT NEED a Hard Bumpy Harsh Ride to Deliver EXCELLENT Handling.  BONE SHAKER COMFORT is for Crap Cheap Cars.   A Mk5 2.3 Cortina will out Handle & out Perform an XR3i  Cortina & you Don't know you are Moving. ( & Granada ) even better Ride than a Cortina.  XR3i  Will shake the Fillings out of your Teeth at 10 mph in a supermarket car park.   We Used a CortinaV6 as a Tow Car for many Years,  So much towing Car Trailers We Shredded the Transmission Doughnut  a Couple of Times.  Apart from that they were 100% Reliable.
I love the moment when the car started for first time,feels like something is coming back to life and sounds so happy to be alive. Barn finds are my favourite episodes,great find Johnny and if you can buy the car,it suits you absolutely
Go on Jonny, you've got to buy it. It could carry the brown chairs. Oh, and, 20:21 Buy the man a decent belt, Pleeease
That interior is so well preserved it’s like a time capsule! What a gem. The next owner will be lucky to have it.
not as rare as a 1 of 1 mk1 2 door granada though :)
Lovely bit of Northamptonshire locked in that garage.  Wonder which dealer sold it new? If Northampton town, Airflow or Alexanders. There were lots of little dealers scattered over the county.  Oh and Jonny? Buy it!
That beast is cooler than a penguin's arse.
Lovely example, shame about the elevator music drowning out the engine noise.
I think I've an "old mans" taste in cars because of the stories my step dad tells me about cars like this! Forget your SUV's and crossovers, I want a proper car like an insignia estate elite or a v90!
What a beauty 😍 love the barn finds. Buy it Jonny
That is very nice Ford 2.8 automatic.  Beautiful car. 👍👍👍
Nice one guys.
Buy  that car jonny you will regret it if you dont even if it means selling something else to make room.
Hi Jonny…Granada Chasseur perfect for the family, perfect for holidays, great 2.8 V6!…great design…chic even now. Perfect for Late Brake trips to next years various Ford classic shows….you could visit RS club show, the AVO show, Granada Mk1 and Mk2 shows etc etc….more strings to the bow Jonny?. Late Brwak Sow goes ‘’Show-off’!!….Hope you but it…Id like to!.
Cool motor with all the bits to go with it. (Always liked the fastback the most, personally).
Lovely video. It passed an MOT in 2011 then did 9 miles before being parked up.
We had a Cortina estate in the early 80's in brown with a tan roof.  Was my dad's pride and joy..... Can't say I agreed at the time as an 8 year old as my uncle has a black Capri which looked cool. However it was definitely memorable.....
I was hoping it was one of these when the vid started, as I have never seen one since I was a kid. There was one in the Ford showroom in Sudbury and absolutely loved the sporty stickers and the way the bronze glistenned - looks to have dulled considerably since i lusted after it. It wasn't a car I would have usually liked but I'm a sucker for sporty stickers :D
That was a fantastic car in its time. It started with old petrol. The newer petrol will give loads of problems in the future.
Love the Granada Estates. My father had a V reg Mk2 Ghia Estate and his friends had a Granada Sapphire Saloon and a Ghia X Estate. Great cars. Vaguely remember seeing one of these years ago, but didn't realise it had all the luggage and interior differences as well. This one definitely desreves to be preserved and cared for...hope you will be getting the cheque book out Jonny and taking her home.
Omg what a lovely car 🚗
As ever, the quality of the filming, dead spiders and cat paw prints in the dust. Presented perfectly. Love it.
Oh wow Johnny , that MK2 Granada special edition is a stunning car and not only that if this cars mileage is genuine then the engine is not even run in yet and I am really glad that she fired up and ran for a while and who it is who is lucky enough to buy this vehicle 🚗 I do hope that they keep the car in the very same condition that you found it in.
Holy hell, that entire engine startup segment was amazing. The editing was on another level. Great work - I mean both getting the car running and shooting/editing it all so well. Brilliant filmmaking!
Great vid Jonny, I remember these my dad had a couple of granada's mk2-3. I remember the logo graphics for this one
Roman bronze! 😂  I always thought more of a shit brown. Lovely family estate, much better than a SUV that's all the rage now.
You must buy this…..what a classic old smoker
My dad was going to purchase a Granada of this vintage as my cousin worked at Fords. However, he went the Japanese route and purchased a Toyota Cressida, this was in 1978. It ended up being my first car in 88. Had it for just over a year and sold it on (Rust got the better of it after a major panel repair in its life) 240,000 miles and had only broken down once due to a duff battery. I just wonder if the granada would have matched it?
Even those retro blankets are worth resurrection
Rare car ,tried to save one of these around 10 years ago ..guy wouldn’t sell …rotted to nothing …interesting if they’re Wolseley was one of the big 6/90 ones …rare ..thanks again Jonny , hope to bid on this when FS
I remember the Granada Chasseur. I worked on Fords of that era. I seem to remember that the car was fitted with odd size wheels possibly metric and only Michelin made tyres to fit the rims and they were very expensive.  Solution would be to fit a set of rims from a Ghia. If it's not already been done.

You can stick yer SUV’s where the sun doesn’t shine, these kind of estates are awesome….mark my words, they’ll have their day again soon enough, when everyone gets thoroughly fed up with carting along a chassis that’s far too big and requires too much electrical power to do it. My Grandad had a saloon version of this gen Granada, in gold with red pinstripe and brown interior. Me and my Brother used to go on “mini holidays’ (long weekend breaks) with my grandparents in the early 80’s, the Granny towing an Estoril folding caravan. Fantastic memories. Unfortunately Grandad passed away suddenly in Nov 84, and Grandma couldn’t bear to see the car, just too upsetting, so it was sold (deliberately) to somebody who lived out of the district.
Such a great barn find Jonny, great video.  Worth buying for the fitted luggage alone, pity Ford didn't try as hard with the Sierra Chasseur.  Granadas in my childhood were the premium German car of the time, always remember Gordon Jackson's character in the professionals and the directors of my dads firm having matching Ghia X dark red saloons before the moved on to Jag XJ and E23 BMW 7-Series.
Jonny never change, your enthusiasm for this type of classic is wonderful. You have to buy it!
My mom had a Green 2.8 Ghia X saloon, was a beautiful machine, till her then partner stuffed it into a wall..
Sod SUVs! Estates all the way!
My best friend's dad had a Granada Commando/ Commander I think it was?? Fitted with twin Webber carbs. Sounded like thunder and went like stink!
Last one, I promise! BUY IT. There are loads of Ghias. Ghia Xs. GXLs from the mark 1. Find me a Chasseur. It's not listed separately on How Many Left.....you might be looking at 3 left 😳
Absolutely love these videos
When you said 500, I thought.....I doubt it. Having read the comments below quite a few people remember one, so I think it may have been in the low thousands. Not wishing to be mercenary, but not only would it be a great project for you to buy, it will be a wise investment. Fords are so popular, and that means value when they get rare
Sometimes i fall asleep at night thinking of my dream 2 tone brown LS swapped Granada restomod. Great little film. Cheers Jonny!
I noticed on MOT history checker, the mileage seemed to get stuck at 49,999, but what a find. I think....the bumpers and roof rack were black as well as the window chrome, and mirrors to set it apart....
Can I have been the only one who found they'd got something in their eye when it first roared into life?
Excellent content, slow viewing, no quick edits.
My mum worked for Ford in their Essex HQ, and the brilliant FMC sent chauffeur Fred in a Ghia X to take her to radio, and me aged 9 to school, playing with the trip computer. FMC continued to look after me for years after, including being the first child to ride in an Orion with blacked out badges, a ride in Ari's WRC car, to cheer me up 😀
there’s a grada sate here in thailand no rust engine needs attention .. brown colour just saying
Wish you could visit Australia and have a close look at an XD Ford Fairmont Ghia ESP. The styling of the Granada and XD Falcon we’re clearly closely related.
Bloody brilliant episode. Took me right back... 👏👏👏👏👏
What a lovely video, not only is the content good, but there isn't one edit to trim out any Umms or Errrs, please keep this up, it's so refreshing to get something that's 'natural'.  My Dad had a facelifted Mk2 2.8 Ghia (Carb and not the unicorn Ghia X), seeing the interior bought back many happy memories of sitting in the drivers seat wishing I was old enough to drive it. Also, my best friend's Dad had a Sierra Chasseur estate, and I never knew they did a Granda as well.
I really want that LHD at he start of the vid.
The presence of the original owner is very strong in this car. I'm sure there were many moments filming this when you'd have loved to ask him questions. Although given how strongly his personality comes across, this would have been at least a two hour episode.  Also, given the luggage resembles record boxes, surely this is the ideal vehicle to to transport a mobile disco? Jonny a new career awaits. :)
Such a cool car! I reckon it's a great car for you to buy Jonny!  Also, the music got very  JayEmm near the end 👍🏻
The most evocative barn find yet Jonny. A family friend had one. A glimpse of the sports activity badge and I’m instantly 11 again. Day made. Cheers Jonny…
My father had a Granada 1 Coupe. Dar blue with vinyl roof. Must have been a 3.0 or 2.8. After that car he got his first Mercedes and said "Once Mercedes, always Mercedes" and drove MBs till his demise.
I had a poster of one of these as a kid. Sadly never owned a Granada myself, but my dad had an 1988 Granada Scorpio.
Look here Jonny, we both know you NEED to buy this. Mrs CarPervert will come to understand, eventually. Let's not draw things out and pay the kind lady.
You've got to buy it Jonny ....
AC control was from the fan switch; you turned anticlockwise for AC if I remember correctly
KGF will probably buy this, and with a white background, resell it for £50k
Prescott Motors probably a Northamptonshire Car, nice to see Dave on your Youtube channel an ex Kettering Boys School lad and a very good BMX'r
Go for it!
Look! we love these old cars and their stories but! We CANNOT ENJOY the video because of ADS EVERY 90 SECONDS! Johnny YOUR SPOILING YOUR CONTENT BY MILKING THE VIDEO SIMPLY TO MAKE YOU MONEY! There are plenty of other youtube channels out there made by GENUINE CAR FANS and NOT wanna bee MONEY MAKERS that can be actually watched and enjoyed
That is a thing of beauty! The Granada was such a great car. I remember my dad having the 2.0ltr Cortina Ghia of the same era, loved that car.
Buy it now
This video proper put a lump in my throat - well done Jonny!
I do remember the Chasseur but like you I never knew what the logo was all about. My dad had a metallic light green 2.8 Ghia estate. FPX848X. I'd love to have that car now.
A Ford Granada Chasseur estate. I bought one seconhand in 1984, as I required something large - ish to transport my two German Shepherd dogs around in. Brilliant bit of kit, just loved mine. 19 mpg around town and about 26 mpg on a decent journey. Three speed auto box and a 2.8L engine. It became a little expensive to run when I moved office and had a forty mile commute every day. I had to sell mine when my wife wanted to learn to drive. A rather large estate car, with an auto box, wasn't something she felt comfortable driving.
That was epic, loved watching and willing this coming back to life. You seriously have to buy this Jonny.
Buy it and get it on the road again
Lovely lovely car! My late Dad had these when I was in my late teens with my girlfriend. My dear Dad let us borrow it for holidays to Cornwall. Very, very happy memories then and I’m still a Ford fan to this day. Great episode Johnny, thank you 🙏
Buy it....!
I remember it being a special edition and the brochure you showed, can't recall what the occasion was. It was in the same brochure as my Mk1 XR2. Until I saw your video I would have sworn the graphics on the back said chasseur in some crazy font as the pictures weren't clear enough. I do remember thinking the brown on brown was pretty cool at the time.
Don't recall that model, but do remember those huge estates! Thought the 2.8i Ghia X was the coolest car ever - it had rear head restraints!! Granted my dad was still driving a Maxi then, so....🤣
Again, fabulous content. Appreciation and genuine admiration of a car is so nice to see from both the original owner and of course Jonny. This took me on another nostalgic journey back to my childhood. My late father had a 2.8 ghia, auto with metal sunroof (not estate), which was like riding in a spaceship when compared to the Fiesta Popular we’d come from. Keep up the great work Jonny, we don’t underestimate the hard work behind this content, it’s important to hold this high standard. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Jonny u have to add this to your collection. Its a bit of history and a cracking motor 👌
Really enjoyed that video, and a car that I never knew existed.  I do love that Jonny whispers up until the Granada is rolled out of the garage. As though he doesn't want to wake this sleeping gem.
This is becoming one of my favorite channels on youtube and the barndfind episodes are the best.
Looks a lot like an Aussie Ford XD Falcon - fabulous car!
Come on Jonny, tell us that you've bought it?
I remember the Chasseur well & also the lower rent Consort & Talisman saloon specials. It was a bit too brown even then & I never understood why two of the bespoke holdalls were fixed.  Still nice though.  My late mother & father in laws had matching 2.8 Ghia saloon & estates!
What a glorious machine, great video Johnny.
Will u find another one...probably not.. get it and save it johnny. It looks amazing
Love it 😎
You need to buy it jonny
Thankyou Jonathan your an animal.
That has buy buy buy written all over it, what a find, clearly loved by its owner.  Jonny you would be a fool not to buy it - find another let alone in that condition. We called them the Council Estate Rolls Royce / Limo
Nice thing, that leather looks more like leatherette to me but Ford did manage to make their leather look like plastic. That rad cass is aftermarket, it would have had the corporate SRT21 I'd imagine. That alarm was one of the 19.99 specials, I recognised the fob. Sounded horrible turning it over initially, stuck valve would be my guess. Not sure why you wouldn't just slave the fuel system rather than pulling junk from the tank but it does seem to be a recurring theme on these videos.
Fantastic find, you jammy b.....  I've always been a huge fan of the Mk2 Granny estate - I've got one right here, in fact, in the middle of being restored back to roadworthiness. Like most younger fans (by which I mean, approximately the age of the cars themselves :D) my Dad had one - it was in our family for years, and back in the early 1990s was my daily driver - it was actually the first car I "owned" (V5 in my name). Started life as a 2.3 4-speed, ended as a 2.8i 5-speed. Eventually, the tinworm just got too bad, and she ended up a banger racer, like so many, RIP.  I don't believe the car you were looking at had A/C (not enough gubbins under the bonnet), but you'd have struggled to find the A/C "button" anyway - because they didn't have one: The fan speed switch also had a push-pull switch inside it - pull for A/C on. And if I recall correctly, there was a small green(?) light came on next to it, when the A/C was on. I had a couple of Mk2 saloons with A/C, it never worked...
Get it in your collection Jonny !!!
What a beauty, didn’t watch the whole video, but really enjoyed the cleaning part at the end and seeing it’s true colours shine. The old estates were massive, we had a Volvo 740, and the Mercedes had one of the biggest estates of all time I think. Great video 👍
I hope this old granny lives to see another day and doesn’t just go back in to the garage. She’s is beautiful !
Superb stuff that Jonny, real unicorn and despite just being an old Granada you afforded it the same reverence as a Ferrari, its so rare to find one, never mind one that is so nearly mint. remember being bemused as a 10 year old at the sports graphics, didnt get it, not a very sporty car, didnt make sense. Remember going in the showroom to scrounge brochures, Quicks for Ford in Heald Green, used to know all the specs.
Love the car, love the video. I'd love it even more if the music wasn't playing over the sound of the first fire-up though...
Jonny as a massive classic car fan I love this content. As for buying it, I think it would make an excellent addition to your collection. I'm sure the family and the gentleman who cherished it before would be very happy know it was going to an enthusiast who will care for it as he did.
I can't have been the only one that was yelling LIVE DAMN YOU LIVE! What a really cool and interesting and rare car, it will be just as interesting to know how much it might sell for. I do love a wagon though.
9:41 That’s what she said
I don’t think there is a better moment than when a old ford comes back to life the spark and cough then lives again nothing like it
Did my apprenticeship with Reed of Torbay and remember working on these and other special Fords, including XR3 Turbo Techniques. Don't rev it too hard you'll break the cam gear, it's only plastic and bleed the cooling system properly as the thermostat is at the bottom of the engine.
You can see how well cars were made back then, even the cover for the spare wheel looks like it's metal.
More old Granada's/ Cortina's please !, BUY IT ! , isn't that Jayemm theme tune ?
Why don't cars have the suit case option as standard. How cool is that.
Love this car, beautiful shape and so useful. It’d be great if Johnny bought this.
Loved this video Johnny, really enjoying the barn finds. I had a white Mark 1 3.0 S and my Dad had a 2.o litre V4. His car was written off when a truck ran a red light and T boned him. I think if it wasn't for that car he'd have been killed.
Would be lovely to see it being used as before. Towing a classic period correct caravan during the summer season. 👌 As always a perfect video Johnny. Please do a follow-up with the new owner or maybe take it to the level where it could drive around with the family.
Nice wagon. Buy Jonny, you know you want to!.  Look up Ford Australia's 79 -83 XD Falcon for something similar.  The XD looks almost the same but a bit larger for Oz. It also came with 4 engine choices, 2 transmissions and 4 levels of accessories.  Incidentally, the Police used to use the 351 Cleveland 4 speed manual V8 for highway duties at the time.  The were also widely used in Touring Car racing here as well, check out 1981 the Bathurst  race where Dick Johnson became Fords Pinup boy for us Ford Fans.  Great show love your work!
Johnny…I bought a brand new 2.8i GLS in May 1979  VTC 900T in Oyster Gold with Tobacco vinyl roof and Chocolate upholstery. It was one of the best cars I have ever owned (out of 75 so far!) and I remember it’s effortless cruising ability and the wonderful Golde factory sunroof..no noise when open even at 85/90mph. It was always a good handling car on the Michelin TRX tyres which are the larger version on Injection cars and a slightly smaller size on 2.8 carburettor models. You can still get the tyres as far as appearance goes but they are not cheap.I kept it as brand new but had problems at work because working in a Bank, my boss had a Company Car but his was a plain beige 2.8 LX so he was jealous and I had troubles with him and others simply because of this. I ended up buying a new Fiesta 1.1l Sandpiper simply to shit them up. I had the Granada until January 1983 when it had done only 20,000 mile# but I changed it for one of the new Sierra 2.3 Ghia saloons in crystal green (NFB 820Y) which was a slow and lumbering old thing after the Granada. I saw it a few years later, missing radio and front door interior panels plus a primer coated osf wing. It did not last long afterwards but I never forgot it,   I do remember the Chasseur version…based on the GL I think so a mix of specifications but as you say, rare..at the time I think it was the interior that was not liked much and may well have dampened sales. If you get the brakes and engine sorted out properly and give it a full recommission and valet, somebody will buy it quickly! Good luck! Richard .🤞🏼🤞🏼😃😃😃😃😃
when are we going to get an update on the austin!?
Nice video. Please stop calling them barn finds.  Most likely the odometer is stuck.
Musical homage to M539 at the end....LOL
Peril music, plus the voice of the great Patrick Allen, the voice of Barrett Homes (in FMC ad) Love it, buy it! But also buy a belt for RetroFord Dave.

Yes! Take this old girl to her next chapter in life. And share the experience with us.  My Mom’s Granada was a US spec 1977 blue coupe’. Straight 6, automatic. The car I learned to drive in. Finding nice examples here in the states, is not easy. No one looked after them.  Thanks for sharing.  JT Orlando Florida
TRX tyres were the bee's knees once. I did a defensive driving course with my local Kent Police driving academy circa in the very early 80s. The on-road tutoring cars were fairly plain Granny 2.8i GLSs with the TRX wheels & tyres. The boss guy had a beautiful dark green 2.8i Ghia X in which, on a narrated demonstration drive, we closed up behind a Ferrari doing about 100mph on the M26. Chummy must've thought he was being pressed by an over optimistic rep so he unwisely pulled away rather than yield the overtaking lane. He'd touched 125 and the big saloon was still there in his mirror before he finally slid left. Our driver effortlessly pulled level and, matching the Ferrari's pace, the passenger (the boss) lowered the window and held up his white topped, Sillitoe banded cap in view of the miscreant driver whose face assumed the expression of someone who had just involuntarily voided their bowels before decelerating away behind us at a rate of knots. I guess that because the Police vehicle had civilians on board they weren't really in a position to nick him so it was left at that. The TRX system was also fitted to many big Fords in Australia and as the tyre technology actually suited recapping the boots remained affordable and available here for many years. My old Peugeot 505 STi ran them on exquisitely cast Amil 390mm rims.
Wow
Ain't seen one of them in years. I had a Ghia Estate and used to collect the model brochures, thrown now, would have had the one with that in. Begging out for saving, go on, take it off their hands and do a rebuild series of on it 👍
A symphony of the purest brown & beige
those advert spots are fantastic  edit: 20:14 🤣
Buy it Jonny Buy it   Very cool wagon
Nice car All the way from Australia, these were like out 80's falcons  So good to see it run again
That's pretty cool. You can see how the styling carried over to the Australian cars. XD Falcon. They came with 6 cylinder and V8 engines.
Do a buy Johnny!
That tailpipe 🤣
WOW ,,,,,,, she is beautiful just love the colour fantastic.😍👍
It just seems a great pity that the owner did get to see the mileometer click over to 50,000 miles on his pride and joy before he passed away. ☹️ Another great Barn Find video from Johhy. 👍😁👍
I don’t remember the car but I do remember getting a bit squiffy on Cooks Chasseur!
Rare, sure. But don't you think it's a bit... you know.... boring?
Sort of a Steak Chasseur Dish . Very brown but pink in the middle .
I have that pattern trim in my 3.0 Capri.
God I remember those 2 tone beasts whatta awesome video n motor m8 fairplay 2u that condition n millage the old girl gonna be worth a good couple of grand all day long will be very curious 2 c what the old girl goes 4 I think really it should really be put into a classic car auction don't u reckon ne way plz plz boya if u could, would u be able 2 let us hava follow up video plz plz plz plz plz plz thank u once again another awesome video reminds of that wideo volvo estate that started n ticked over beautifully keep em comin plz bruva 👍👍👍👍
Fantastic video - how can you not buy it?! 😀
Proper suits you that johnny
Wow!  Is that THE most eighties car ever?  I thought the Rover SD1 was really cool but this takes the biscuit.  You have to buy this one Jonny, you know you do.
You just know that MrsCP is going to be rolling her eyes at the mere mention of yet another car appearing at TLBS Towers....
Used to maintain a couple of them back in the day bloody beautiful car even better that it s an Estate
I think I know that voice. 😃 Not at fully charged anymore? 🤪
My brother had one of these they were epic. I was around 11 years old and the car was so fast back then and it handled so well. I have so many memories of it. He ended buying another one years later and I drove it, it was such a great car to drive.
Always liked that generation of the saloon and the estate of the Grenada - really a timeless, well-proportioned design. Never heard of the Chasseur before - personally not a fan of the brown but that interior with the tartan and the fitted luggage is epic! Terrific vid, great camera work and editing/music, one of your best
That font on the tach takes me back to my 1980 mk1 fiesta, my first car. Love the Euro Fords.
Love to see more of this granada please buy it 🙏
Keep your grannys alive for as long as possible !
Great video Jonny & what a fantastic car - loved the 2-tone fords of that era & you brought some memories back. My dad had an x reg Cortina Carousel (dark green / light green) which ended up being swapped for a burgundy jelly-mould sierra - I hated that thing, probably because I loved the Cortina so much.
Great vid jonny keep them coming!!
Great video Jonny! Love the commentary and camera angles... oh, and the car!
I'm sure I remember this special edition from back in the day, I think a family friend used to have one. I remember the later Sierra version of course. Great to see such a rare survivor!
wow what a car for its age trully brilliant 👍😁
You need to buy that estate, mate! 😉
If it's not at the NEC next year I'll be mad! LOL!
Made me want to cry seeing this old granny start up again. They all had a noisy starter. Brilliant video. 👏
What I want to know is why Ford North America didn't import these to the US - they were far superior to what they were building. Typical, heh?
What fantastic find guys love the old granada had a 2.8ghia x back in the day
Looks like it’s got Australian Ford Falcon XD headlights and front indicators.
Want. Lots.
I remember the Chasseur,but only because my old man worked in a Ford dealership in Glasgow.there were a few rare special edition Fords that I recall.The Granada 'Gladiator', The Granada''Consort',The Cortina'Carousel', The Capri'Calypso',The Capri'Cabaret',The Fiesta'Festival',The Fiesta'Bravo',The Fiesta'Dash',and The Fiesta'Quartz'.And the ones everyone remembers like the Cortina'Crusader',The Sierra and Capri 'Laser' and the Sierra XRL.
This episode was like a game of strip poker...
The only time i get to see Granadas these days is at banger racing events 😭
Always an interesting back story to these barn find vehicles. Great to see that special edition Granada all intact and time warp condition as well.
Wow! That's a great find. This car needs to be back on the road and loved again. You could see it was a carb model as the i's had a front spoiler with 2.8i embossed. I sold two of these in the day one manual i and one carb Auto. We used to sell a lot of Granada Estates....mostly 2.8 i Ghia X's which all had the TRX wheel tyre combo at the time (on the injection models). It was a fine car and much admired at the time. If I remember right, the A/C was turned on by pulling the fan speed controller out one notch, but this was over 30 years ago now, so I may be mistaken Jonny. That's not an original R/cassette, nor the 'radio hold switch. Don't let whoever buys it dump the TRX wheels tyres. Spend the money and do right by the car.....the TRX wheel tyre combo was its crowning glory and looked really cool. Really enjoyed that trip down memory lane.
It’s a wow moment 😎
This is a lovely episode. And as for the car itself: look at that shape in profile at 15:31 -- it's perfectly proportioned. Just lovely.
"Car Eccentric" 😀👍
That's just lovely
aquascutum interior
Did a Lot of camping in the 70 with Granada 4 Doors and touring just a 2.3 very good. Denmark Spain No problem has to be the German motor. English version not good For 140-150 kmt to Long!
The look of pure joy in Jonnys eyes while washing off the dirt and dust.  What a classic old beast.  All the practically of a classic merc estate with Ford running costs.   I’d probably put some aftermarket wheels on (to save money on tyres) and keep the originals in the garage. But nobody’s going to have one of those at cars and coffee are they?
Ah, the first few seconds really hit my nostalgic nerve. My third car was almost exactly like that 2.6 four door, only slightly darker blue colour.  Lucky for me, dad had a petrol station...
My dad's last car in the UK (before we moved to Australia) was a MK5 Cortina "Carousel" Estate. I'll have to find out the rego plate and see if it still exists.
If some scruffy  clown started my old car up after 20 years without putting oil down the bores first id be pissed off. Sitting on a seat with untreated dry old leather isnt smart either
buy it now or it wil be never again
I didn’t know ford used TRX wheels.... last time I checked prices for tyres on my citroen cx GTi turbo, 215/55/vr390, they were about £400 each!
I tell you what,  never mind the Granada itself in all its browness but the previous owner deserves a massive pat on the back for keeping her for all.that time and obviously cherishing it.year after year.  These old boys are a dying breed. They knew about servicing and keeping things lubricated. No doubt everytime.it went out it was washed, leathered and had a coat of Turtle Wax or.something similar.  It would be good to get lots of old photos of it in various locations etc as a bit of a tribute for.the guy. My advise, get it bought or get.one of.the team to buy it. An absolute MUST on The Late Brake Show On Tour for 2022.  Top job, what a thing to behold.
Fantastic find. I remember seeing one in a dealership in Wolverhampton when i was a boy and have always loved then. Buy it
Omg.. I recognise those roads😂
Great find Johnny, my question is can it run on E5 unleaded fuel? My Favourite Granada I always wanted to own , was a 2.8 I x Executive!
granadas were rich peoples vehicle. great motors but not for the average joe  that car doesnt seem to have air con either as no recirc system on the fan blowwer switch
BROWN
By the comparison to the US Granada. That’s a fantastic Car. Why does Ford make Great Cars for you and Rubbish for us? Buy It John you deserve it
Awesome video again Jonny and a model that always stuck in my mind. I started work in '79 at an Accident Repairers and remember having one in the shop for repair in maybe '81. Granadas were pretty special back then and easy to tell the various models from Base to Ghia X. They did a few Special Editions if I remember and the Chasseur really stood out...I think there was a Sapphire as well, two-tone Blue and Silver and maybe a 2.8i 5 speed Sport (?) towards the end of the Mk2's life, with a front lip spoiler, I think I'd seen them in Red and White with a pinstripe kit. Hope you buy it.
An emotional one for me this my late father's poor man's Rolls-Royce used to used Granada 2.8i ghia Estates as our family and his work wagon. I used to lie down in the boat with my Raleigh Chopper on long trip's. I remember hearing about this limited edition but never actually seen one it must be a unicorn surely 😍👍
My dad always had Granadas for his works car as he was a Chauffeur for a local chemical company. He had 3 MK1's and 3 MK2's (all saloons) when I was growing up. One of the company directors had a Chasseur as I recall, but an estate would not have suited dads job. I own a 1977 MK1 3.0 Ghia on an S Plate myself.... lovely cars and real head turners these days
I used to collect dealer brochures when I was a kid and had one of the brochures specific to the Chassuer.     I seem to remember a very sophisticated tinted look to it.     I said to my Mrs it'll be a Chassuer but was slightly thrown by the Olympic graphics, I didn't remember  that.      That is a really stylish, usable old bus, it's very cool.   My mate had a 2.8i which seized on the A6 after he had dropped a core plug into the water jacket, the crank bearings didn't really appreciate it.
My Dad Loved His so much as a Company Car he Bought another on Retirement..   The Check Cloth and the Luggage in the Boot..
Remember traveling to London in the boot of one of them with two other brothers still had room
Let's hope someone who really wants it, gets it and not some moneybags greedy git who only wants to make a quick buck. It meant so much to the owner but not the descendents....
I swear I saw a car like that driving round my home town Burton Latimer back in the late 80s/early 90s….. remember my mates calling it the ‘mars car’ cause it had a colour and shape like the chocolate bar.      That’s looks a cracking motor
Jonny I love you, but you’re British. It’s garage. Not gar-raj. Another Americanism that’s creeping in here sadly. Great video as always.
Thats very very cool. I have only seen that as a model car in 1/18 by BOS. Never knew they were sold in the UK. BUY IT Jonny
I think you are the hardest working content creator I can imagine. And I watch tons of car related YouTube channels. I hope you hit 1 million early next year and then quickly hit 2 million and more. Thank you for your efforts! Love everything you do!
EV conversion!!!
You're giving me blue balls here Jonny by not showing the car after cleaning.  Great vid tho and a great car too.
Childhood memories 💖 the last real estate car ford made
Brilliant Video, this is why we love your videos, the barn finds, the story, the passion 👍 sorry I criticised the last video for the over privileged private schools boys but this is back to the normal top drawer content.
What an absolute gem absolutely love 80s fords
Talking of rare….. https://youtu.be/iCUSB1KHnhc
Absolute stunning once again, I adore these barn find videos, especially so on examples like these, the relatively mundane cars, the sort that were street furniture just 20-30 years ago. Christ.. 'just'.. but to see such cherished examples of such relatable and nostalgic cars makes a video like this far more appealing to myself than a similar video on some exotic supercar. And what a stunning edition of a stunning car you have come across here. I am not really a Ford bloke, but this is 100% right up my street. Hope it can go to a home who can cherish and keep it in use for family holidays for many years to come.
Chasseur is French for hunter.
I used to work at a hotel in 1988 near Bridgend in South Wales where the Ford plant is. Ford management used to stay at the hotel, one of the Ford guys who used to stay there hated the Sierra and had a 2.8 Granada estate in silver and blue on a D plate, which he had to jump through hoops to get that as his company vehicle.
I remember these!
I had a mk2 escort in same brown.buy the granny n keep it for some caravaning advedtures
Mileage isn't genuine unless they MoTd it at home
Another enjoyable video, love stuff like this.
Buy Jonny, you need that car! 😁
I had one of these back in the 90’s,it was sold to me as sportsman estate ….
Great vid love the grannie remember my dads 2.8i ghia 👍👌
Loveley motor
Amazing find. When I was a teenager my dad owned a mk2 2.8 GL auto, to this day my favourite car he's ever owned. You've got to buy it 😀
Mr Regular would just lose it in the presence of all that glorious BROWN!
Get it bought Jonny, you know you want to.
Ford Australia bought out a metric wheel on the 1982 ltd  15 1/4 inch
Johnny, it is your duty to buy this fantastic car and continue it's story. It needs a great home. Fantastic show as always love the channel.
I’ve seen a couple of those limited edition Olympic Granada’s before. They’re amazing in that colour
Im old enough to remember this edition - chap in our avenue had one - it was IMMENSE compared with our Imp
The Australian built 1979 XD falcon was based on the Granada  The sedan was similar  The wagon looks familiar at the front  The rear was totally different  There was also a ute panel van and long wheel base Fairlane and ltd as well
Don't let this one get away
The previous 6 Mot’s from 2006 all show 49,999 miles. Obviously the Speedo didn’t work for many years when it was running so mileage isn’t genuine Jonny.
I only remember this car existed, because I saw a semi derelict one on YouTube a long time ago, but never saw one for real.
Ya you need to buy its beautiful
When I was 15 or 16 my friend's father had one of these from new, after having a Granada saloon. I thought it was fantastically quick and luxurious,  the smell of leather was terrific, the auto box super smooth. I'm pretty sure I drove it around the village playing field in Capel St Mary near Ipswich when we helped set up for the village fete. I have alerted my school friend to your video and I'm sure he will show his dad who is now 81. Great video.
What a brilliant video, full of memories, you did the original owner proud bless him, getting her to run and the wash on his drive that he would have done all those times over the years was a real heart stopper, his family will be proud, nice one Johnny
I wish I had the money to rescue that beautiful car.
Amazing
Jonny I have owned 6 mk 2 Granadas back in the eighties including a chausser mine was a carburettor version, if memory serves me correctly there was only 500 ever made, hope you do buy it and look forward to seeing it again on the channel.
I remember this particular model as I'm nearly 50 & from Essex. Think you should buy it Johnny & add it to your future videos 👍
Now that Mondeos are a bit meh, would it be bad of me to get a Jaguar XF Sportbrake and wrap it to be just like a Chasseur?
I had a 2.8 injection estate, that was quite good fun. It had aircon (the fan switch was the giveaway the one in the video doesn't)
I’m not sure if I can remember these or not ! The Olympic badge seems very familiar  Love the interior 👍🏻
Buy it and turn it awd electric... you could probably get 150 mile battery in it. What a comfy daily driver!
Jonny the kind of guy to not feature any kind of normal Grenada Estate.   You snob you...
A roof rack. That could actually carry stuff, without having to buy extra stuff to make it useful. You could turn those handwheels to move the crossbars to fit whatever you wanted.
My wife’s father had the Granada Chasseur and her mother had the fiesta Sandpiper which was essentially a his and hers with matching colours.  My wife and I were childhood friends and I remember them both.  Amazing find Jonny. Brought back a lot of memories.  Great film
Chatham fabric inserts...fake Burberry...perfect description.
We had a 2.8 Granada Estate as a pool car at a firm I worked at years ago, I borrowed it one weekend, filled it up at the Services on the A34 as I left the services I floored it in the rain and lost control of it, spun 180 dec,  went backwards and hit a road sign and flattened it, and ended up on a grass bank, such a laugh.
I hope it goes to a proper Ford fan who drives it and enjoys it. Not an internet twat who sees it as an investment.
it's poo coloured but the interior is fab...
It needs to be saved and kept in the highest order possible.  Not only for the original owners memory but for all the children of the 70's & early 80's who grew up with this iconic silhouette on our roads. Johnny if you can't buy it, please ensure it goes to someone you know,who will love it as much as the family and you do.  Amazing find & thanks for sharing.
We never had the Granada's in Australia but we did get the similar styled Cortina and Falcons that came with a 4.1L straight six. The Falcons of the same era where a bit larger and also came with a 302ci and 351ci V8.
Well done you two. What a wonderful thing it is to preserve such treasured cars as this.  The dedication is a fine ending, and the car in its new life will be a dedication too ...
I had forgotten about the Chasseur, but as soon as I saw it I knew what it was before you named it. Lovely to see it
Nostalgia as my dad had a ford granada sapphire 2.8 Ghia in the late 70s early 80s I think and without looking I think it too was two tone colour being blues or blue and silver,then not long after that he got the ford granada coupe and I think that was a 3 litre,apart from maybe the super car luxury cars being made now the days of the classic cars have finished,like these,I’m guessing the last classic cars now would be like the escorts,fiesta,golfs,205 gti’s etc
Had two Granadas…… a metallic dark green 3.0 GXL with a tan interior…… and a later dull silver 2.3 GL  With the earlier one I was Jack Reagan……. but probably sounded more Inspector Morse…..  SHUT IT YOU SLAG !! 🇬🇧🙂  Just to add….. I’m doing similar with my 2005 XC90 D5 SE 185…… 55k miles….. annual towing duties being the rare and only outings…… 😎
Again , loved this Jonny,  i remember these estate's too and that sports logo ! Great find 👏 👍 👌
Love it! I’m about to do the same to my 75 TS Keep em coming Jonny 👍🏼
That brought back fond memories of my 2.8i Ghia X, great car. Thanks.
I drove a T reg mark 2 estate 2.8 auto  ghia for a bit years ago. Loved it. Visible screws. The lock was so worn,  could use any kind of key to open it 🤣🤣🤣
What a car, like a time warp it's so original and complete. It'll get a good sale price for the family I'm sure.
Cracking vid and good work getting her going but the backing audio was a bit loud for me - wanted to hear the idling better :-(
A great find and a great car 👍 I had a 2.8i Ghia X exec with the TRXs, first thing i did was get rid if them for RS 7spoke alloys lol They handled really well for thier size, no doubt helped by all round intendant suspension 😎
I have good memories about my dads 2300 red wagon, I took us on good holidays into France, I think 1979 and 1980
With cloth seats they are One of the comfiest cars to travel in. Childhood memories going to seaside in one of these.
Buy it mate
Love the sound of them V6 Granada’s, makes me feel very nostalgic. I think they launched the Chasseur because Ford was on the brink of launching the facelift Mk2 in ‘81 /‘82, so they always launch special editions to help sell the last of the outgoing models. I remember these cars well, very rare beast indeed. Move over Johnny, I quite fancy this myself!
This is one of 2.6 had Power How times have changed Michael
Buy it Johnny its gorgeous
Bet we see Hub nut driving this car soon !
Amazing! A question that crossed my mind. What now? I've watched, I think all of the barn finds, and it dawned on me, what has happened since you found them?
Yet another fine piece of jounalism and true fanatism of all thing automotive ... Well done Sir
You must make your best offer to buy this gem.
One of the kids at my middle school had one of these in his family. I remember the luggage in the back. I think they also had a BMW 635 with the reg 635 BMW. The Grandad got the BMW plates when they sold it.
This channel gets better with every episode. Great format, and I'm sure I am not alone in sharing the excitement as the cars are pulled from their resting places....
Nice one mate thanks for finding and sharing this with us,my grandad had the cortina estate and a Granada saloon,was looking at them on market place the other day and you can still get a bargain although if I had the cash for one of these I'd probably go old American instead
Hi Jonny, brilliant video as always. I'm 62 now. My Dad had a a MK2, 2.3 litre for a good number of years in the 1980's. The car that he had before that was an Austin Westminster, 1963 model I think. This was when I was quite young, maybe 1967-ish. I remember the Westminster was parked in the garage for many years, before finally being dragged away to be used in 'banger racing'. It was only many years later, that I discovered why the car had been parked. Dad was a builder, and in common with others in his trade, liked a drink of beer or several... One evening, on his way home from the pub, the Westminster stalled at a set of traffic lights. Of course, there was a Police officer handy, who initially came to offer assistance. However, smelling Dad's 'beery breath',  tried to arrest him for driving under the influence (I think this was before breathaliser bags, but I maybe wrong. Dad, 'tripped up' the police officer and ran away, but was subsequently held by a member of the public. So, the notes in his old 'red book' driving licence, recorded after his trial read: 'Driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Resisting arrest and failing to provide a blood sample.' The court found him guilty - obviously, and sentenced him to three years imprisonment, suspended for three years; Banned from driving for three years, and a £250.00 fine - A lot of money then. I remember the old Westminster, languishing in the garage for many years. I would love to see you find one that was worth restoring.
That's so satisfying to see: a lovely survivor going into good hands. Brilliant!
Loved this, never heard of this special edition. In 1987 I had a 2.8i Ghia Granada MK II, wonderful car. In 2004 I had a Scorpio Cosworth Estate (bug eye), when it ran properly was a stunning car but was a money pit and rarely ran properly lol
A Chasseur with its luggage still extant. Win!  You really ought to buy it.
Why the hell am i getting emotional over this old 'Granny'?
As a previous owner of a Capri 2000gt (v4), I always wondered why Ford chose not to incorporate the better engineered granada suspension onto their capri updates.
Enjoyed the video and the joy in their discovery was right pleasant.  Lovely.
Fantastic video. Never seen one of these on the road, cant remember when I even last saw a normal Granada
The way you are making these films is just spot on - it’s not entertainment- it’s a public service. You express everyone’s reverence beautifully. Well done !
Find a mrk 5 cortina now that’s a car
I distinctly remember the Sierra Chassuer.
Not in love with this mk2 but the mk1 Johnny drove in with looks super.
buy it , preserve it , it deserves it
As soon as yer dead, yer most prized things are just trash to be discarded....
Good evening Jonny Yes back in the early 80s I remember seeing one of these driving around Thame in Oxfordshire,  I must of been around 12 years old and a petrol head at a very young age , it was that badge on the boot lid that caught my eye as I had seen anything like it  Cheers Phil
A car show for car enthusiasts ... by car enthusiasts ... I'm old enough to remember Top Gear before Clarkson got his claws into it and ruined it ... (sigh)
Just lovely..... You need to buy it.
I was thinking it was a chasseure when the video started but didn’t know what the Olympic symbol was. I do remember my dad saying that he wanted one of these when I was a kid as I think he knew someone who had one as a private hire taxi.
You well need to buy that Granada Jonny, it needs you and you know it 😁
Jonny please please please buy that car, please 🙏
Lovely car i had a 89 g plate granada scorpio 4x4 great car loved it wish i still had it. Buy the granada Mr Smith
Buy it - Buy it -Buy it!! I love your barn find videos and how much you care about them and your actual interest in them, a true car enthusiast!  Don’t let this rare beast slip away Jonny! It’s what your public wants 😉 Keep up the amazing work in everything you do 🙌🏼
Can't help but think that the Smith family need this and a similarly aged caravan for roadtrips and merch at shows... ;)
I live in Chatham but have never heard of Chatham Check before lol. From memory the aircon was turned on by twisting the fan speed control to the left, you'd have three fan speeds with aircon to the left (marked with a snowflake symbol) & three fan speeds to the right without aircon, looking at that fan switch it only has markings to the right, so no aircon on that particular Granada I'm afraid.
Always loved the Chasseur!  I remember my mate at school's Dad bought one after his Lancia Beta HPE rusted away.  I always thought these were Ghia spec (given the alloys) but apparently they were only GL.  I loved these, they were rare at the time and they are now like hen's teeth.  My Dad had a white 2.8 ghia saloon with a brown vinyl roof, one of the late pre facelift mk.2s (MAV 821W). One of Uwe Bahnsen's best designs (especially pre facelift)
The washing did a good job for the car. Its color looks brilliant,almost like its brand new.
Beautiful. Just beautiful. Great to see it's still alive and kicking. Thanks for sharing Jonny, and thanks to the family for letting it be shared. Whoever ends up owning this motor had best keep it super straight and LOOK AFTER IT!!! 😎
As soon as you said Roman Bronze I knew what was coming. I prepped a couple brand new ones in the day, we had probably 3 through at most. A p/x one was sold to a local landlord as I recall. Patrick Allen voiced loads of Ford adverts at the time, 80's Ford dealer memories!
I just had a look at the MOT history of this car. It's dropped 9 miles between 2010 - 2011.   Really enjoyed this episode, I always loved the old Granada's. I would love a fastback edition.
Hideous. I thought the Stateside Granada was ugly.
Jonny any idea where they will be advertising it?
Very nice touch with the dedication at the end.
Brilliant.
Jonny I love your Barnfinds films. This "Granda" is a cracking thing, an amazing preserved and rare beast! You would be the ideal custodian for it and I and I am sure plenty of other viewers would love to see you purchase it, get it back on the road documenting the journey.
Get it bought Jonny awesome car that 👍👍
Loved that. Pure entertainment. Thanks, man. 👌
Love this!! 😍 my Dad had 4 V6 mk2’s & that engine sound was the sound of my 80s childhood! I actually had a tear in my eye when it started ❤️ If I had the storage space & no family commitments, I’d have a mk2 Granada in a heart beat. Whoever buys it is very lucky. Great video once again & thanks for sharing
I remember the days of putting a drop of petrol down the carb to get a car that hadn't been started for a while going in them days as long as you had fuel and a spark and a decent battery you you could get any car started
I thought you were going to find a 2.8i sport !!! ……… It’s the only car I’d consider trading my superbee for
I coveted my school friend's dad's gold 2.3 estate on an '84 B. We sat in the boot to get a ride into town and the engine sound was so distinctive. Last I saw of it, one of the mechanics from the garage they owned had it on its 3rd time around the clock on its original engine.
My Dad's got an S280 Mercedes that has sat since 2011 only 10 years! It's a 1998 last of the W140 model with 40 or 50 something k miles on the clock down in Kent if you want to come have a look at it possibly get it running Jonny? Not that old but a future classic in the making..... funnily enough he had a couple of Granada's when I was a kid.
I remember them being launched, if you had one your family had arrived.
always amazes me that over the pond there such small vehicles were used to tow campers.  awhile over here in early 80s , they would have used a Chevy Suburban with a 454ci for the same use
I remember it, our local dealer had one Meteor Ford Moseley Birmingham,  they also sold the Fiesta Firefly a Crayford Convertible conversion and a Australian imported Ford Falcon called a Ltd or something like that. Remember around the time there was Blue over Silver Granada which think was a Ghia model rather than a limited edition. Also for ages around 81 there was a RS2000 for sale on W plate at the dealers because everyone wanted the XR3, it was red with a black vinyl roof and a soon roof. Love Big old Fords, so cool.
That's lovely Johnny the mk 2 granada is one of my favourite cars please keep us posted on it's progress 😀
I love old fords . I’m dream is to have a my 4-5 cortaina
My dad had the 2.8i ghia X (which I crashed into a neighbour’s fence while reversing, I was only 14!had it repaired) was extremely sad when he got rid of it as he loved it so much!
When you said a Granada special edition I straight away thought of the brown estate. My dad ran a garage from 1970 to 2009 and in the eighties we had one of these in for a rear wheel arch repair, I remember him having to buy the Ford stripes to complete the repair. I remember thinking what a gorgeous car !
If memory serves selmar alarms were single wire fix, sold in argos.
Gawd, please don't let it end up on the short ovals..
I wonder if Vauxhall nicked that colour and interior combo, my first car was a Nova SR in bronze with a brown interior and similar tartan centres?
Can't be many pre-facelift mkII Granny's around these days.
My Grandfather was a Ford man. I remember Corsair, Zephyr and  Zodiac, all Dark Blue.  The Zodiac, with the huge flat bonnet  ( V6 probably), it required an ambitious garage enlargement project (length and width) with insulation and lining with about 20 doors, a bizarre sight.  One Zodiac trip he took me on to see an  Army pal of his, this included an hour or so in an isolated country pub, a brisk run home with  a Ton !  No  seat belts  and lots of cigarettes. . . . ..  Grandfathers last car was a cute 1300 xl Escort, 4 door, Red  I'm sure it was Firenza Red . On her first driving lesson  my Sister put it in a ditch, over ambition by the instructor  . . . .my Dad !   He blamed the cunning new fangled  cable clutch.
amazing johnny.....BUY IT and do a restoration series. mega views for the channel and save a classic into the bargain
Back in 2005 I picked up a nice one owner 2.8 Ghia estate with a dead engine. My plan was to drop a Ford V8 into it along with a Ghia X interior from a saloon. I advertised the original Ghia interior  and had a guy come along to buy it. He arrived in a stunning  chasseur estate, which was the first and only time I've ever seen one in person. Unfortunately he bought my Ghia interior, to replace that of the chasseur. He bought the full interior, a set of facelift bumpers, stainless trim  and a set of 14 inch wheels to replace the TRX's. I believe he bought the car from an undertaker somewhere near Carlisle, what's more it had if my memory serves something like 15k miles on it.
This was refreshing. I must admit that I was about to give up on all of these garage/barn find shows. Too often they featured really nice cars that had been allowed to deteriorate beyond all hope. Here is a case where the owner took genuine pride in his motor and was able to preserve his vehicle in such a way as to be able to pass it on to his family so that they might enjoy it themselves or perhaps sell it on. Well done.
OMG my dad had one of these - never seen another - I loved the interior and the panniers in the boot - that never got used.😄
I had a Granada 2.0 l 4 cil  auto of 1982 as my first car...damn i mis it..the are so hard to find now ..
Another great episode. Thank God you washed it, I think you should always give them a quick buff!
My Parents had PNC77R a Miami Blue, black roof, 77 3.0 Ghia from 6mts old till 93. He nearly swapped it for an 85 C 2.8iGhia X estate but mum preferred the Miami blue to the new pale blue. I wanted him to get a Roman Bronze one but it wasn't to be.The std Granada Ghia X had leather pillow top seat cussions. The air con switch is the fan switch but turn the other way or pull out, can't remember, should be a little red light in the centre.
I absolutely love that, it's been on 49999 miles for a number of mots though so I suspect the mileage is wrong
Yep remembered the chasseur Johnny as soon as the door lifted I knew it was one of those I remember the sporting emblems and the luggage, I always wanted one back in the day, ended up with a 3ltr capri instead, happy days😊
I remember putting ab engine in one of these when I was an apprentice. When we tried starting it it back fired through the car and set my bosses eyebrows on fire.🤣🤣
I had a Grenada Estate 3 litre in 1977, a hand-me-down from my boss at the time. It was in a very tasty light blue metallic colour. Unfortunately the boss (previous owner) had used it primarily for driving the 1/4 mile to work and back every day. So in spite of the car having only 35,000 miles on the clock and looking fantastic, the engine was full of condensation and therefore completely shot.
I had one of them
My dad had a Grenada Scorpio 2.9 L Cologne OHV V6 it was an epic car
Gotta love an old granny. My grandad and dad had Grannies, Cortinas and Escorts all through my childhood.  Cars do not sound like that anymore and the sound of that starting up took me right back to when I was a kid.
Wow Johnny. That just brought loads of memories flooding back, we used regularly drive to Austria skiing in a chasseur just like that. Great touring car. Surprising good in the snow.
I remember that there was one of these in the village where I grew up, I saw it one day parked in the village pub car park and had a nose around it being a big Fooooooooords fan when I was younger, I especially remember the people decal on the wing....It was then I realized that somebody was sat in the drivers seat and I causally  walked off and a bit embarrassed, It must have been brand new as I was about 10 years old at the time so 1980 ish. Great video love these ones, keep it up Johnny.
The real  model e'S'tate Plaid Camera car....tow rig ....classic....do it.
Wonderful car a piece of history, that engine sounds sweet, a great buy for someone
A newsagent my mum knew called Brian (I think) in Heywood Lancs had one just like that in the 80s. He tried to convince my mum that I should buy it. At 17 it wasn't insurable.
Holy darn my mates dad had one exactly like that in SE London and we loved it!!  And being of Scottish heritage as kids we loved the interior hahahahaha! What a machine and it had the TDX tyres, that tread sooo distinctive!😜. What a great find!😜
The want is very strong with this one. Granadas, especially mk1 stcar, always gets my attention. ..but a mk2 special edition with the two tone paint and that interior. I SO want it. If i live in a country where a RHD car would work, i would look into this further.
What a beauty, totally unmolested Grandad. Someone is going to be very happy owning that.
The leather/rubber on the accelerator pump in the carb has dried out, obviously, as observed from it quitting each time you crack open the throttle.
Lots of memories. Dad had brown GXL then blue/silver Ghia X Exec.   Love the matching hand luggage. Perfect for stashing Mayfairs.  Air con you pulled out the fan button, took my dad months to work that out.
Great video Jonny, travelled round Oz in one of these beauties , 20k km with no issues, Ford Falcon in Oz. Can’t wait to see the before and after
Love the car, and the wee promotional interludes through the video, sets it off nicely
Much of that hard-start was self-inflicted...
I so badly want to see this restored! A beautiful and interesting car, much rather see this restored than a Porsche or Ferrari!
Love it, what an amazing find. I had a mk1 Granada many years ago, still miss it. As an ex tyre fitter I spotted the metric tyres before you even mentioned them 🤣
What a rare and beautiful car.  I vaguely remember that model, but the one I really wanted was the 2.8 injection saloon with the 5 speed manual transmission. I had the 2.8 Capri, but the pram wouldn't fit in the boot.  I went to buy a Granada Sapphire saloon in Blue and Silver, but as I drove into the street, it drove out!  Someone had beaten me to it!
Wow this brings back some memories. My dad had a Chasseur when I was a kid. I actually still have quite a few parts from it in my garage including the luggage set and the gold wheels!
Do it Jonny
I do love a barn find that's in a period correct house also!
Fantastic, I remember this model. I had a 2.8i ghia X with trx wheels , white with blue interior
Love these.  Remember being impressed as a kid by the 2.8V6 here and in the re-invigorated Capri at the time. Those integrated bags and the built in roof rack and chrome all blacked out made for a very special wagon, even in the eyes of a Volvo loving family. (Our 245 was about the same shade of bronze) Great stuff, again Jonny.
Lovely old Granada. My dad had a Granada Coupe love these old cars.
You got to buy that .never see one again
Fantastic video loved every minute please buy it and feature it , 👍🏻👍🏻
Go on Jonny, add it to your collection.
I love the  "Does Jonny have permission to be snooping around in this garage?" vibe at the start of these episodes.
Criticism: there's nothing more the viewer enjoys then hearing the sound of an engine firing up again after many years. Drop the background music so everyone can hear the purr
My late father had two Granada's a mark one and  a mark two, both great cars.
Great film Jonny Remember a couple of Granada Chassurs from my apprenticeship at a Ford garage in the 80s Parents had a 2.8 then a 2.8i Granada back then, which as a teenage driver I borrowed to take girfriends out. You could legally do  that in the 80s😁
I had an Hawaiian Blue MKI 3.0 Ghia auto saloon back in the early 80's. Loved it! Knew lots of my dads friends who all had MKII's at around the same time. Some were 2.3's, but they still went well enough.
Buy it!!! And/or bring it to the next show!
Another great episode - cheers Jonny
Buy it !
Buddy absolutely love ❤️ your show puckers me up after a break up …. Ledges
Loved this one Jonny. We had two Mk2 Estates, a 1980 2.8 GL followed by a facelift 1981 2.8 GL. Dad always says the 1981 one was one of the best cars he ever owned. The facelift was in August 1981 IIRC.
Banger racing anyone ? ( runs and hides )
I can't be the only one that watches these barn find videos with a happy tear in my eye. Great work as ever, Jonny. I'm a sucker for old Fords at the best of times but, this is very special indeed.
Mega 💪🏻
How special is that thing..... oh wow :)   Cheers for this vid, takes me back :)
Awesome. If I sent you my mcm chopped snapback would you wear it on a video? I would be willing to buy another if this was possible 🤣
Omg I remember drooling over one at a ford dealership in walsall in 83/84
This brings back memories from when I was 18 years old in 1989 owning the saloon version of this 2.8 v6 granada ghia , going from a Nissan one litre to this was just amazing but I don’t miss the times spent pouring petrol into the carbs during the summer in traffic ( this was a common fault with these ) , petrol starvation due to the carbs positioned in the V of the engine … this car was so comfortable to drive …then i traded it for the little Fiesta XR2 Mk 2. 😎👍
Hopefully you buy it and give it a new life
I had a 2.8i ghia x saloon in  Metallic   powder blue loved that car
Where is it going to be listed for sale please? Lovely video, I smiled all the way through, thank you!
Your  best yet,I hope  it finds  a good home!
What a Stunner! You Need to buy this car Jonny! It would look so good next to the Charger and a cracking family wagon..
Johnny these barn finds series are just so good, yet again miles in front of the others
Love these barn find vids. Mix is just right, not over geeky. Just works well with Jonny's nature and natural enthusiasm for all things retro.   Not sure how these vids with play out in 40 years... Look at this early model 3, with primitive fsd, the paintwork was bad at the time, looks awful now.
Buy it, Buy it,  buy it !! 🤩
I had a 1977 mk2 estate silver jubilee special edition, silver and royal blue never seen another since, can anyone tell me how many where made ? 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍🏻
Hi Jonny . When you say you're tempted  to buy it do you  feel a slight sense of guilt because 'first come first served!" But l think this will be a keeper ? Have to say the retail price was staggering ! And how did you find out about this particular car ? Thanks Jonny .
Boss, simply boss👏👏👏
In the late 80s a colleague rolled up to the office in her new car, which may well have been rarer than this model.  A mk2 Granada saloon with the 2.8, but it was L spec and a manual.  The fact it was white gave it away as ex police.  It had zips in the roof lining and compartments for fire arms.
Ford need to buy that for their collection.   Stunning
Jonny get it bought 😄👊
stop fkn revving it!
Jonny, I thought you went back in time there on the intro onto the set of The Sweeney with that MkI Granada! I can see how Ford Australia looked at the MkII Granada for inspiration for the 1979 XD Falcon/Fairmont range. Many common parts there.
Great find. I do remember these when they came out. My favorite Granada would have to be the Consul GT or later Granada S..manual with sporty three spoke steering wheel.
Mono radio/stereo casette! 🤯
I'll let you off with the JayEmm-esque synth music as I'm nearly emotional. Seems almost a shame to roll the mileage over.
great video Jonny we had Granada's here in Canada and they were just another body on the platform developed by Ford in the early 60's and was built on the 2nd generation of that original platform, the European edition Granada had much more engineering and refinement built into it and far more available equipment and creative comforts, those metric tires/rims with TRX tires were an achilles heel here no one wanted to carry those tires at retail, they were not mainstream sellers or sizes and in the cold weather they were just like driving with banana peels on each corner and if you wanted winter tires and rims they were special order only from Ford dealers only and 3 companies made winter tires to fit those steel rims, Michelin, Vredestein and Yokohama, the special part of the European Granada was the independent rear suspension, here we only got a solid rear axle and a weak one at that, the big entry level seller here was a 2DR, 4 cylinder with a 3 speed standard and it couldn't get out of its own way, it was a dog on the motorway and don't dare try to pass another car unless you had a mile to do so, one thing was good was the fuel economy, it would easily get almost 40 mpg in base form and the optional power steering for $129.00 made it an easy driver and to park at the malls ,i can't say more than that about them , other than they were a huge fleet car and one of the biggest rental fleet cars in the day and had big boots for all the crap you hauled along on holidays, drove many of them working part time in high school for a car rental agency and always found interesting things cleaning them out on return from a rental customer knickers and all sorts of things  🤣 , they  always started in the cold and had terrible heaters in them and some did not have heated rear defrosters in them which made them dangerous at times to drive, all the same another era of cars that were cheap entry level so anyone could afford a  car. 👍
Great video👏Theres something comforting watching a barn find, probably nostalgia
Buy it Jonny (if you havent already) it deserves a good home
I had a slight panic on when young Jonny dove into the chocolate boot satchels... if it were my fathers car I think you would find vhs tapes of questionable European adult import. And of course a Feu Orange On the mirror.
I am currently restoring a Granada mk2 2.0l 4 speed
Still awesome an looking wagon and probably as rare as Hen's Teeth/ Rocking Horse sh** and worth a good few pounds now!!!! I'd be taking that to shows as often as I could if I owned it. Too nice not the share it with the World. Plus 40+ years old. No need for tax, MOT plus ULEZ Exempt (two fingers up to Mr Khan!!!!), gets better by the minute!!!! 😁😁😁
RIP Gerald 🙏
Buy it! Keep it safe! Lovely car.
Buy it, buy it, buy it. #colinfurzetunnel
Absolutely beautiful car. The gentleman who owned this will be smiling down watching this.
Ha! I guessed right. Not only have I heard of a Chasseur, but I knew TWO of them. The first was cousins in Shetland and I saw it on a trip ‘doon sooth’ in the early 80s when they visited us in London on their way to Newport to see other family members. The other was my mate’s dad, who went to my school and lived about 400 yards around the corner.   The latter was a great car, and my mate’s dad loved it. My cousin’s was a different story. It was a classic Ford Friday motor. There was so much wrong with it, in the end, the dealer offered to send it back to Ford. As it would be sent to either a Welsh or Liverpool plant, and they were due to have a holiday with the elderly aunts in Newport, he drove it down. The dealer arranged a replacement car while the Chasseur was assessed/fixed and my cousin said if it wasn’t fixed by the end of the holiday, he’d expect a refund, or see him in court.  Ford said it was fixed and on collection, An engineer, asked the guy in charge what was wrong. It was very much a ‘how long have you got’ moment. As a warranty recall by the dealer, they started looking for faults and just kept finding them. It just hadn’t been put together properly in the first place, so it was all a bit, well, not like a new car.   My cousin said it felt like a new car and for the rest of the time he owned it, it performed very well.   I always loved the colour and the fact it was the estate which looked great on that model, and long before the grand tourer was brought back in earnest by European builders.   EDIT: Actually, I was still mid-reaction to my booster yesterday and I think my cousin actually dropped the Chasseur at Dagenham for assessment. I think they were made there and at the Cologne plant, if memory serves me well.
Ahhh this brings back memories. My dad had a Ford Consul in that colour back in the 70's. He recently passed away but he always had that down as his favourite car over the years
I had a '79 Escort in that colour.  This is the first time I've ever heard it's actual name. Roman Bronze. We always called it "Sh** brown" 😂
I remember the decals, literally first time I've seen them in over 35 years
My mate had a manual 2.8i GLS estate in white... loved that car
Always liked the Consul GT Coupe in either Rhinegold Met, Roman Bronze Met or Forest green Met!
I just love your Time Team with wheels episodes. 😁
Why do I suddenly want a Mk1 Granada Coupe in gold with a brown vinyl roof?  That is magnificently brown. I love it.
Why rev the car so hard from standing for years an also cold????
I saw one of these once outside our school. Explained at length to a mate how special it was, geeking out and doing a proper walk-around. It wasn't till we reached the end and I was explaining the Olympic badging that I noticed a girl I fancied had been sitting inside it all the time, hearing everything. You won't be surprised to hear I never got anywhere with her.
Brilliant Jonny, a Mk2 pre facelift Granada would be enough for me but a Chasseur is on a another level. Love the Granada, from a time when fleet managers bought only Ford, Vauxhall or Rover and a Ghia was about as good a symbol of success as a middle manager needed. What a joy to watch this!
The aircon was on the fan speed control, you pull it out to engage A C. However that stereo is far from original, the original fit was a Ford own brand unit. They were excellent, no idea why Ford starting working with brands such as Sony later on.
My first car memory.. My dads 3.0 consul GT with a tuned 3.1 .. Tear to me eyes
Never new this model existed, what a car.whos dad didn't have a granada back in the day. My old man had a 2.8 ghia with the spot  lights in the grill, brown interior. It was so lovely to sit in the back going from Southampton to Cornwall every summer. Great barn find ,great car Great colour. Great video.  Love to here all the information that you got on the car to. 👍👍
Is it the Chasseur?
Jonny, this car has your name all over it.. Don't even hesitate. Its you  through and through, your face tells us that. Be happy, just get it. 👍
Brilliant. Those old Ford V6 engines always sound lovely.
And everyone loves a brown chasseur!  - adam c
I remember these . In my collection of old car brochures that I collected as a teenager I’m sure I’ve got the sales literature for it.
I seem to remember a Cortina in my dim and distant past belonging to a mates dad being a chasseur, It was a lovely blue over Silver colour but that is all I can remember.
Ahh that Granada ad with the quintessential voice over actor Patrick Allen aka Phillip of Burgundy.  Mk2 Granada is such a great machine from a time when Ford really could compete with a 5 series.
Superb
Lovely video Jonny, much prefer to see a barn find washed and running. I’ve had two manual 2.3 estates in my time and loved them, sadly I suspect they went to the banger track after leaving me.  I would not hesitate to buy and run this over a modern SUV if I was in the market for one.
??? it runs it drives.  has no brakes. battery is fucked .. ??
Buy it mate !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fantastic. I remember this exact model. I thought it was going to be the ‘2.8 Injection’ model (with Recaro seats) An equally rare model which came after the Chasseur. I have the 1982 brochure in front of me.  Johnny, please buy it.
It's a sportsman Granada ...they came in one colour and trim ...wish I had one today
What a great find! The Chasseur editions were indeed very rare in the UK, but a little less so on the Sierra Sapphire and Estates. Due to the Chasseur logo, with its group of stylised sportsmen, the cars became known (by me and a friend (RJC) at least) as "Gruppo Sportivo" models, after the Dutch popsters who were big-ish around that time. The Granddad's lovely competitor car, the Peugeot 604 Ti/STi, was also fitted with the grippy Michelin TRX tyres on metric alloys in the same year. Thanks for a very interesting BF edition.
These cars existed in a time when you could recognise a car from a mile off due to all cars having their own individual look. I got into Granada's like a lot of kids of my age back in the 70's  watching Jack Regan & George Carter with Bill has their driver speeding round London in the 'Sweeney' ( I mean who can ever forget that Intro of the Mark 1 in blue coming at you with that amazing intro music). What an amazing find, it is a find that dreams are made off. Thank you Jonny.
What a beauty, Love the old Fords.
I remember seeing a new one in the show room at Hendy Lennox, now Hendy Ford in Cosham near Portsmouth 👍
Absolutely a cool car,the interior is so of it's date. I actually really like it😂😂 i hope you thoroughly dried the car after you washed it,don't want any water making more rust. Great vid as always Jonny. I can't wait to see your sleeper Allegro soon.
Nothing beats that image of Onslow's Cortina backfiring!
Being a Rover person myself, that is gorgeous.
Don't drag yer heels on this one Jonny,sh*t or get the Tarton 'Pot(Lol)! I have an '80 Granada 'ESS'---'European Sports Special' which was given to me by a neighbor who was going to junk it because His family didn't like dealing with people(and it was 'old and out of date'). It's got the 302 V8 with Auto,Magnum-500 Wheels Power everything. I'm the 2'nd owner. It's got 10,660 miles from new. Original everything. It's got the 8-Trak Player the 'Spooooorrrt-AH' 3-Spoke Wheel,Cartier digital Clock,it's got it all. Hard to believe it's as old as it is. 1980 was the last year for North American Granada's.
knew it was a chasseur soon as i saw it, but had forgotten the little badges. used to drive/ service one in early 80s, almost bought it off the firm myself, but couldnt get insurance [under 25] really not the best thing to do, revving up a dry engine thats stood 10 years, waterpump will be toast now. hope you drained the modern sh*t petrol back out, it will eat the hoses + corrode the tank/sender very quickly. trx tyres, expensive then, + personally i think they drove better on standard, suited the waft.
I can definitely see you and Chops touring around in this. I at least hope the new owner is able to bring it to a TLBS live event so we can see it in the metal.
As a kid my dad had a bronze Granada Estate Ghia… again bought to tow the family caravan.. we all.over that car
buy it
What an amazing find. Thank you for showing us it Jonny. My dad had a fowds Granada 2.8i spoooouuurghtttt...ah And I loved it. He sadly had no idea how brilliant it was and traded it in for a 2.0 GL cortina 😱
Who doesn't love an old Ford estate. I may be slightly biased though. I definitely think you should buy it. Very difficult to put a fair value on it.
I had a Ghia X mkII my second ever car in 2003. So many memories of road trips and music festivals with mates and my girlfriend (now wife)!
No usual interest in ford whatsoever but something about this one… checking mot history, passed religiously every single year until was laid up
Always loved estates and what a peach you have here ! My one uncle had an Audi 100 quattro estate 2.8 when I was a kid . My other uncle who worked for Barclays Bank had as his company car a Ford Scorpio with Ghia badges I think ?  and I think that was 2.8 ?? I'm not sure , remember discovering it's rear seats were heated !! And electronic adjustable .  Totally blown away as a car fanatic 11 year old !
"if you like brown" mr. regular from regular car reviews is currently hunting you down..... i'm sorry.
Jonny you absolutely have to purchase this incredible car. What a find!
What a beast. I've had a few MKII Gannies in my time......I'd love this one & I'd keep it as a 'survivor'.
23:55 Revs the arse out of it...  Then Johnny says "Oil pressure's good"...  Lucky that!
,y youngest brother had a sierra chasseur, we always called it the chicken chasseur because it sounded like an indian cuisine lol
What a car, hats off and huge respect to it's late owner, I'm sure he will be pleased with this video and that she will drive again. Beautiful car
A few words about Chicken Chasseur would help me empty my head and concentrate on the Grandad Chasseur..
Thought you were going to unveil a 2.8i, I so want one of those, I’d forgotten the Chasseur or that it even existed but what a find. I do much prefer the mk2 saloon, but this one is fab.
That won’t take much selling, what a beauty
Jonny these barn find episodes are definitely the best thing on the late brake show, keep them coming.
U need to buy this johnny,a true unicorn from the past
Great video! Production quality is the best I've seen on YouTube
Loved watching you giving the old Granny a wash Jonny - I remember a contributor on Smith and Sniff saying that they want to wash a car to get to know it, and I could see you building a bond. It's a beauty, and I think you should seriously think about giving it a new home. Best wishes buddy 😊
You wash it, you buy it 😁 wonderful
Great video, great car, thanks.
I had loads of grannies over the years but I once had a rare pre facelift Mk2 2.8i Ghia S, had a 4 speed manual and LSD from the factory, also had an air tank in the boot, air shocks and an airline to the towbar but I assume those were not fitted by Ford.
Almost brought a tear to my eyes.......... great job guys !
When do you check if the engine oil is ok?
Fantastic Barnfind. Beautiful classic Granny!
Beautiful car Jonny, amazing find - ' Old Fords Never Die ' !
Buy it Jonny. You know it makes sense.
Remember seeing one of these brand new in the local Ford dealership, loved the ideal of matching luggage.
Probably one of my favourite Fords. Many happy hours spent in my local Ford dealership  trying them out for size ( I was about twelve years old )  The Granada is such a handsome old thing, when estate cars were  styish and practical, a vision in brown.
Nice.    2x👍
Blimey! I never thought I'd see one again!  Back in the day my mates dad bought a brand new Ghia Saloon in 1979 and the alloys and electric windows blew my 7 year old mind and I became obsessed with Grandas. I used to see one of these sometimes on the way to school in Truro, it was very elusive and I couldn't quite figure out the graphics.  I liked the Ghia X and 2.8i but was intrigued buy this edition.
ive never been one for a ford, never got the fuss about escorts and all that but the granada is a car that does take my fancy. im not sure if i could ever ben torn away from my scimitar gte though, and after watching this it dose make me want to start tinkering.
I bet that was such a smooth lovely motor to drive
Had a chasuer, 2.3 estate complete will luggage, had a 2.8i sport estate, had a 2.3lx estate and had a sapphire estate, 2.8 carb, also had 12 MK1 coupes, numerous salons, 3.0s, GT, had far too many Granada. Then went onto Scorpio with the last one a 2.9 cosworth estate on a 98 facelift
Can't believe how good that interior is, and the exterior didn't look bad either. I always think of The Sweeney when I see a Granada, but not the estate obvs! You never have caught Regan hurtling round s corner in anything with a tow bar on it...
Hello. I never saw one of these cars.The ford Granada I know is the American version a little bit boxy.v.good. 👌👌👍👍👍
Lovely to see her running after all this time . So rare ! Probably rarest of the lot after a 2.8 injection  estate . Those seats are epic 😀
I guessed Granada Chasseur before you opened the garage. Had the Ford brochure as a kid with the Chasseur in it.
Fascinating, and a great video. Thanks. I had heard of the Granada Chasseur but only because my Dad was close to buying one, I recall the brochure. But never got to see one in the metal. Sadly he went for a Renault 18 GTL estate for the caravan towing. Again in brown.
If you don’t buy it , I NEED to buy it !! Have been looking for a Chasseur off and on for well over 30 years. I have to scratch that itch !!
Brilliant. When I first saw it I thought it was called a Talisman. Was that a Granada model as well?
As soon as I saw the badges I recognised it....... For the life of me I can`t remember why.... My best guess is that my Boss had one... In which case I would have driven it.....  Always been a Ford fan... First car Mk 1 Escort 1100 2dr ... JVR 400F...... :-)))
Buy a set of mats to protect your set of mats. Yep, hands up that's me. I bought a complete set of brand new VRS mats for my MK1. And, I couldn't even bring myself to use them!
I knew this model existed but i have NEVER EVER seen one out and about. And If i did i would have intantly recognised it. Very rare car!  Those tires look like Michelin TRX's. Very posh back then.  This car competed against the likes of  Mercedes 280TE, the Volvo 765GLE, the Citroën CX break, Peugeot 505 gti break, the Audi 200 Avant.
I would like to buy that please
Love that car it’s amazing 👍🏻 was a bit gutted not the hear the engine idle at first over the music but was amazing when it started
I hope you buy it Jonny. Another fabulous video.
and cowley
I worked for a photographer who had a 2.8 Ghia X estate that as a 18/19yr old used to drive with some vigour around Norwich in the early 1980s.  Loved it.
£307 inc vat per tyre for the Michelins that are fitted to it? I need a lie down after finding that out,  Jonny!!! Cheers. Leigh.
good enuff the sweeney
Sign of a good mechanic? Pants dropping below cracker jack when in engine bay
That’s a humdinger!
You had me @ Chatham Check..
keep your LP in em
Proper car, none of this canbus shite.
Buy it Johnny, you will really will bring it back to life. Excellent video, thank you for sharing.
Wow Jonny, you did it again. What an awesome find. The condition is just amazing. You looked like you were falling in love with it when you were washing it.
You should buy it
Shame you can't do a part 2 , where you detail it and see what needs doing for an MOT
i love the panniers inside lol
Absolutely love these barn find videos. Thought for a moment it may have been a Huntsmen but think they were only Escort and Cortina.
Get it bought Jonny. There’s only about half a dozen left.
Get it bought Jonny. There’s only about half a dozen left.
Here in the US everyone crunched the wagons (estates) so the older ones are really rare to find.  Actually, it's rare to see any at all on the road now.  Should be pretty easy to swap out the TRX wheels to a standard size Ford wheel and help sell it.
Love you Johnny smooch lmao, fully charged is a broken mess without you but this is by far a better journey well done i like electric and made a few scooters and bikes but i dont feel the hatred they have of ice.
I just love that interior, I think the car deserves to be in your collection so that we can all still enjoy it in the future
What a cool old bus...  Get it bought Jonny or you’ll be kicking yourself ...  As Harry Metcalfe says  “ go find another “
*IF I LIVED IN THE UK* id be putting in a bid on that...      ALWAYS likes the Roman Bronze Mk2 Granada after a friends dad gave me a lift in one to school...  It was the first "Luxury" car I ever went in - we had a Hilman Avenga with a hole in the floor and 2 broom handles stopping the driver's seat from falling through NO KIDDING.
They put thought into the dream this car was about - work and weekend use - with it not being a marketing gimmick. The buyer who deserves this is in their mid fifties with a dad that came home one evening with a company car, either Cortina or Granada. They will remember every detail of that formative life experience when everyone was happy and breathing in new car smell. How much to recreate that? Priceless really. Just have to have a garage big enough.
A reminder to all we are just caretakers of our vehicles... I hope enough get saved for future use!
Great video as always, love your enthusiasm for these barn finds especially when they are everyday cars that our dads/mums drove. Not sure what your you’re getting sniffing the exhaust fumes when it first starts 😀 I thought Richard Porter was the one that sniffed petrol!
Este  carro  parece  a belina  do  Brasil  fantástico
Great find that one, can’t remember last time i saw a Granada let alone a limited edition one 😂👍🏻
I love these 'barn find' things - they're a fascinating slice of suburban history! And boy, don't they just show how completely awful, rust prone, primitive and unreliable old cars were! Modern cars are just stratospherically, massively better at  absolutely EVERYTHING!!! Rose tinted nostalgia is a beautiful thing - but, you know!?  Cold, hard reality ......!? (err, do I need to get me coat .....?!)
Wonderful find Jonny….loved the Mk&2 Granada’s!. I’d buy it if I were you…it’s rarity makes it special. Richard
Please please please buy this Jonny, I want to see more of it, amazing colour combo
Colour scheme is the same as my dads old mk5 Cortina crusader ,The names were different tho,Rio brown over champagne gold and the same pin striping  .EKD 510Y long gone but great memories.
Just finished my Sunday dinner, beer in hand ready to watch this! Cheers🍺
I'm a big fan of Mk2 Granada estates. I haven't seen a chasseur edition before, but it looks glorious. Those sports decals remind me of very early Binatone video games
Brother had a 3.0 mk1 loved it.
I think with cars like this where it's possible you should pay to get them detailed & serviced then take them out on the road.Make a two-parter.
Odometer has been stuck since 2006!
Was there also a Consort? I think it was similar spec but saloon only in dark met grey.
Hasn’t run for years, no oil change, revs the arse of it when it first fires. 🤦‍♂️
How much do they want for it
What a car buy it.!!!
I remember one in my local dealership,we went one Sunday looking at the latest hot Fiesta for my mum. I seem to remember my dad rather liked the Granada but he was loyal to Volvo. My mum bought a Scirocco.
LOVE the vinyl album cases in the boot - but FOUR?!  OH! - He didn't run a mobile disco, did he.......?!
My sister's friends dad had the exact same model back in the early 80's. It looked huge to me cos I was only a little kid.
Used to sell those special  edtion Granada
My Dad had a silver mk1 with a black vinyl roof. He once drove me and eight friends to the local cinema to see Grease. Very fond memories brought back in this video. Thanks Jonny.
What a incredible car so so rare how do you value something like that ?
Nice
Go on, Jonny. Do a buy!
What an incredible car and such a find, love these type of videos with a human story to them.
Johnny. You’ve got to buy that… Surely Ford Heritage would be interested also? 🤷🏻‍♂️
I dreamt of having a 2.8i GHIA X with TRX wheels as a kid.
I remember when that shape of Granada was current, and thinking like it’s smaller brother the Cortina, how old fashioned it looked.  Compared to other cars of the early 80s. But now, it really looks so of it’s time, that there’s something very charming about that.     This particular one is great, not just as an oddball Ford edition, but that it was clearly cherished by its owner.  I hope it gets to live on for many more years.
As soon as I read ‘rare special edition Granada ‘I knew immediately what it was going to be before I saw the first glimpse. Have had 5 Granadas of various versions but always wanted a Chasseur but never came across one. Amazing it’s still got the luggage set too. Lovely colour combination.
Can we all please ask Jonny to buy it?
Real status cars back in the day,Ghia coupe is my favourite 👌
Love this car. Jonny I so couldn't walk away from this I'd have to buy this car.
Perfect car for a DJ (of the time) the luggage looks ideal for record boxes👍
My uncle had one brand new, was an awesome car I went in it many times. He had a brown and gold silver shadow 2 at the same time. Quite a pairing! Would love a chasseur 😍 so pleased to see a survivor and what a beauty! Hope it gets fixed up, wouldn't mind if myself! I've never seen another on the road, ever, only the one my uncle had. Thanks for sharing 👍🏻
My E28 5 series had metric TRX wheels.  Tyres were 200/60/390.  I replaced them with 14" rims.
Something about an old Ford starting up after years and years always gets me. Cheers from Perana country!!
Jonny you HAVE to buy that rare old beast, you will do an honest sympathetic restoration please dont let someone else do it. The owners will know its in safe hands with you 2.. 👍🏻🤙❤
For some reason the thing that transported me back to being a kid was the sound of the boot closing. Made me feel a bit emotional 😢
Beautiful relic,Jonny! Buy it!
Awesome find. Thanks.
Yes I remember one of our neighbours having one up in Doncaster. To be honest I hadn’t realised they were that rare (back then)
"Hoards of children" The perfect car for Fred and Rose West.
buy this car...
My god that styling has aged so well. Beautiful car
Had that one we always called it the tennis racket one and I had a Ghia x think paid £600 for the tennis racket
You had the full  mental willpower of every viewer with you when trying to start that. lovely car and video.
Never heard of this model,will find a good home no problem
Buy it!!
Poop brown and tartan.. what a combo ❤️
Shall we all chip in a couple of quid to buy this?
As a 12 year old my rich mates older brother had exactly one of these!! He was only 19!!! This was 1985/86. His Dad ran a BMW 530i (E12). Great film!! Thank you
Great video love the barn finds Johnny🤪
Great video years ago my great uncle had a few of these a custom and a 2.8 ,Ghia felt like a vip riding in it tried to get my dad to purchase it . Did they do a cortina chassuare as well ?
Love these Barn Find vids, Jonny there the best!! What a cracking "Granny" and perfect 80's colour combo. It's so satisfying when you get a vehicle running after so long, been there a few times. Would love to know it this one gets back in the road.
Fantastic vehicle 👌
Yep , remember seeing one of those Jonny and being intrigued by the sports graphic !  GET IT BOUGHT MATE !!!!
Brilliant .. what a car....my grandad bk in early 80s  had a dark green metallic mk2....took me right back
I’m a real ford fan and this vehicle escapes me, the estate 2.8i sport with factory fitted roof rack & white alloy wheels was the car 💯
Jonny, how is your knowledge on these sorts of thing (silly question i know!) Guy around the corner had a Granada estate when i was younger, possibly a dark green or even black but stickered up in a very similar way to that one with the olympic decals but iirc correctly this one was either tennis or golf related? Interested to find out what that one would of been about now!!!
Great find! I remember regularly seeing a Granada Chasseur around town way back when. As for the Michelin TRX tyres...I  had a heck of a struggle getting a set of 4 for a Testarossa some 25 years ago.
Can you imagine someone doing this to an e.v in 40 years..Great content as always jonny...
Just started watching I hope it’s something to do with flying squad or something!
Really enjoyed that thanks 👍 Though however nice a MK2 you find it would never reach the beauty of a MK1
I had one off them still have one of the cases in my cupboard
I have original mk1 ford Granada Ghia in sliver 1975 had car since 92 it's my daily drive
I hope Dave or somebody like him gets it and brings it properly back to life , another great find , my favorite TLBS Videos .
You've got to buy it, Jonny. We need to see more adventures with this beauty. Estates are going to exist only in the minds of some generations soon. Grew up riding around in Cortina mk3 and 4 estates of various family members. Loved them. Great to see this loyal family servant so well preserved. :)
Lovely. I had a base spec 2.8 4 speed manual saloon back in the day. Ref tipping fuel down the carb air inlet. I don't understand why folk do that. Engines need atomised fuel and air to run. That just risks flooding it. That's why easy start is a spray. Brake cleaner works well too.
And yes Jonny, you do need to buy this car.  Just think, it has more space in it than the Jimny for the school run ... that's how you can justify the purchase to Chops.  🙂
Magic I had two 2.8i Ghia,s and two Std 2.8i always thought they needed another gear as they drank fuel but I could forgive them as they were like fast armchairs would be nice to pop a modern gearbox in one these days and transform the car. Nice find Jonney a special car indeed .
Fantastic find 👍👍👍
I've had loads of Granada's and my fav was always the estate. My white 2.8i Ghia X was a fantastic car and drew admiring glances even 20 years ago! This is a true unicorn for sure. 🦄
How many built is the question not answered! 😢
Very enjoyable video, loved these cars back in the day. I was wondering What make Is the portable battery charger?
I do remember this model, how can you not remember this colour combo 😂, it’s got you’re name all over this 👍
Oh my, I love me a pre facelift Mk2 Grandad Estate. This is sensational.
What a stunning car really enjoyable upload well done keep up the good work on your channel 👍👍👍
What a fantastic example. Hope it goes to someone who will enjoy it.
And imported the mk3 into North America as part of the Merkur brand. Had on on car wizard. The Queen had two special 2.8i auto estates with special interior and one of the survivors was in classic Ford a few years back.
Interesting to learn about the UK Granadas from over here in Canada.  We had a Ford model in North America with the same nameplate, but it was a completely different car with the underpinnings up until 1980 based on the earlier Maverick which was cribbed from the 1960s Falcon ... the same platform that gave birth to the original Mustangs.  In 1981 and 82 it was a Fox platform car (same as 79-93 Mustang), but the name died in North America after that.
Lovely motor we agree 😂👍
Lubbly jubbly!
Jonny, is it possible you could follow up these barn finds and drive the cars once they've been recommissioned?
Found myself shouting YES once it started, oh my ❤
I was aware of the model but that's the first one I have seen .. the brown interior is mint 👌 love it thanks for sharing  👍 you found a hens tooth 😀
You know you want to buy it Jonny!
Bet you it’s real. Mileage. Yeh . That’s guaranteed.  It’s family owned from new.
Barn finds in America: 1970 LS6 Chevelle SS 454 Barn Finds in the UK: Ford Granada
Brought a smile to my face, this. Brilliant.
amazing beautiful car i would love to have one .
Man you have got to buy that 👍👍👍 Great vid
I can remember when i was 7 my dad picked me up from bus station. it was mk1 granada ghia .i remember it like yesterday lovely looking machine
Love those old ford granada’s
hello from Sweden love your Granada
UK Granada looks very similar to the Australian TE Cortina Ghia 6 Cylinder. 🇦🇺🇦🇺 hello from Brisbane Queensland Australia 🇦🇺🇦🇺
Stand firm fellow Purebloods ❤ NON COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY
Wow.  Wow.   What a thing.
I nearly bought one but I chickened out
Starting a car on a winters morning used to be fun using a choke. Oh those were the days.
It amazes me you even think it’s possible to fire a car up after all this time
A few seconds in and there's already a Mk1 Granada on the screen, so that's a 'like' straight away
The classic broom boot strut
My parents had a later jelly mould Granada - and a mates dad had a Cortina at the time we had a Mazda 323 - the Cortina was infinitely better
My 1982 2.0 Fowds Granada is getting a saab 9000 2.3l engine soon.
I have always wanted a chasseur granny
Ford North America used the metric TRX wheels on some of their models around 1982-1984 as well, including Mustangs.
Nothing like a Fowds barnfind to finish a weekend!
My grandparents had granadas
always impressed by people who have watched the whole video after it has been up for 2 minutes
They simply don’t make cars like they used too!  Thanks for the video, 👍
First comment!  LOL
I've always wanted one dude! 😊❤️
