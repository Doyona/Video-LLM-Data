Best of luck with the Challenge! The TH14 Challenges can be tough if you’re not that level usually so stick with it, you get unlimited tries. Also a huge thanks to iTzu Gaming for helping with the strategy, be sure to show him some love!   Where Does $500 Get You on a New Account: https://youtu.be/gNcd-lW8ASo

After watching your first few videos on beating these challenges, I’ve been able to 3-Star the last few on my own, thanks to you. So thank you.  And on this challenge, your way is way easier than my way. Lol
Hi judo sloth I hope all is well i have a question.! We had 15 max ids all are maxed. When we start a war how super cell gives numbers in war. Mean witch id will come on 1st 2nd......to..15.!.? How to balance..?
Thank you sir. got 3 stars
pleased help me bro, i completed the challenge and get 3 star in shadow challenge. but why i can't change my base scenery. i also send the code (judo). @Judo Slot Gaming
It's to fast for me I can onlly do 2 stars
Wow, I totally forgot about this challenge until the last 30 mins. Watched your video, followed it, and 3-star-ed in one try. Thanks!
I’m out of my depth
so complicated
Being a new Th12, it was hard. Tried every other strategy, but pulled 3 stars in every account by this one!!! Tysm JudoSloth.. ❤✌😁
Did it in second attempt, thanks !
Big thanks bro I got it on the first try with this and that's never happened before 😤🤝🏼
I almost forgot about the challenge but it was quite easy and quick with your guide. Thank u man though being a th11 I completed the challenge in 2nd attempt ❤️  Love from India 🔥
I luv u🥺♥️
I’m a th 12 and it only took me 7 attempts to 3 star the shadow base. Woohoo! Took me like 20 attempts for the last one so def improvement. Thx, Judo!
Thank you for the little cheat sheet, kept getting 80% and was kind of annoyed to not get it right.
I just honestly win the shadow event just right now its a successful fight. I really like to thx mr Judo for the well explained tutorial i really appreciate your effort. I hope u can help more and Bless your channel 😍🥰💯🔥
Thank you for this :)

Worst video ever ever sumit 007 is better than you... I am also stuck at 94% to 98%
Thanks for the guide. IMHO it'll be great to put a cheatsheet in the end, marking out troops with numbers indicating sequence & location to drop.
It took some practice, but I got it!

If you deploy the blimp early and soak up all the damage it falls right into the eagle compartment. Pretty convenient, plus damage on its path.

Make a video how to make our own strategy according to the base th 11...
Probably the hardest time I've had following Judo's strategy. My biggest obstacle was the clan castle. It would be forgotten and I would run out of time. Finally did it, in about ten attempts.
Tried this around 20 times to finally hear you say if you are not th14 you can't beat it as easy, what a waste of time I spent! th7 vs thDoubleMyLevel was a dumb idea
Thank you so much Judo your the best!
Ohhhh bruhhh u r legend of coc ...best attack i have ever 3 stars

Good guide. I didn't do it perfectly and still got 3 stars as town hall 10
took me a bunch of tries, damn there's a lot of stuff to work with at th14
It worked me wonders even when i was slow to deploy my troops in the order you advise. I had like 50+ attempts to no avail. Most i got was 80% and 2 stars
I messed up the steps big time after dropping the royals but somehow still managed to 3 star in my very first attempt after watching your video. You're the man judo 👍
Thank you Mr. Judo
thanks judo its very easy you just have to place right troops at right time then hogs will do everything
I did what you did. Wasn't clean. But we got it done.
Makasih infpo ya
This challenge is my thirteenth reason

Thank you
I actually got 2 stars by spamming everything in the bottom corner lol
Thanks, I BEAT IT WITH 1 SECOND LEFT!!!
Thanks judo but I have attacked more than 20 times to succeed .Many a times I got 97%,99%,95% e.t.c
The best I got is 93% (Im TH11). I still had my queen with 5 healers and then ran out of time. Then I decided to look up how to beat it because I tried too many times already.
I did 3 star on this base with my strategy and did a swag of 192 troops and 8 spells. Your strategy is useless 🤣🤣🤣
LITERALLY BRO 1ST TRY GOT 3 STARS
thanksssss!!! even i made a lot of mistake putting many troops anywhere but still got three star lmao rhxx
thank you very much
nice video. Always have to look up your videos when there is a challange. Since i only have th11's i cant understand how to use all these troops xD
These are a bit hard to follow but he got me to 80% when I ran out of time if I had more time I wouldve won
1:23 how did that minion died from air trap
thanks judo complete the challange

Thanks Judo level TH9 got there in the end after many tries lol

This was so easy it is ridiculous
I am a townhall 11 player and needed 3 tries to three stars the base thanks to your guide
I had 10 attempts but still failed :(
Just tried this strategies and it works on 1 try..ggwp thank you for the tutorials judo sloth👍🏻
I want to sell my semi max th 14 id, anyone want to buy?
Its crazy how th14 and pro players think, i have like 8 days left and i always ran out of time and never had a clue on how to do it, i was doing the siege right but everything else was random lol, and then after seeing the vid i got it 5 times in a row without a problem lol
Just completed in Second try...thanks judo
Took me a few tries but I did it, THANK YOU, JUDO!!!
thanks for all the tutorials and tips !
Watched twice and did it! Definitely missed a few steps but it was a real challenge for me (I played this a long time ago, at the time town hall 10 was the max, but I just now downloaded it again yesterday so I am only at town hall 7, didnt know half of these troops existed)
I'm always failing with time, any suggestions  ?
I did this in first try with sawing 2 Archer 3 wizard 4 headhunter 1 sneaky and I am th11 player thanks
how can i equip the theme?
现在已经开始内卷了，已经有人不用法术三星了😂
Thank you for tutorial
I did it without help and the queen charge was similar but I used yetis on the other scatter and hogs from the bottom with rc on the eagle and king cleaning up with the rc.
Stars from Queen Walkers get this challenge only with he heroes.
كفووو
I can not get this I’ve tried over 300 times getting between 95-99 percent I can not get this
ITS BETTER TO DELAY UR ARC AND DROP IT AFER THE X BOW LOCKS ON UR KING
Wow, got hairy towards the end, forgot the invis and was early with warden but made it with 7s first try! Thanks!
Thanks bro
Great tutorial! Success at the fifth attempt. Thanks!
I had a really good queen walk strat I came up with but I would always time fail
FIRST attack was a 98 % time fail but I still had a ton of troops left unlike the first tutorial I watched before his was released 2nd attack was a 3 star with 17secs left,and ohh the previous event was a 3 time 3 star straight So helpful I really needed that potion  My clan placed 6th on the cwl 😁 116 medals,what a joke
Best tutorial 🔥
Yes thank you !!
Thanks done in First Go
Only 99% .. CC is never going down.. short on time … useless strategy.
tnx judo!! just 3stared it after 6 or 7 tries lol
I don't understand how people are able to keep track of everything like this
Thanks judo sloth gaming..I have 3 star😍👍🏻

Judo is always my go to with these challenges. The man just never disappoints, managed to get three stars on the shadow challenge for all three my accounts now. Good stuff Judo.
I finished with swagging one Rage and one freeze.. thanks
I’m only TH 13. Why did you use the invisibility spell right there? Does it make the defenses ignore your troops?
They need to extend the time on these late th battles takes too long for the timer
I used different strategy but after 8 times I got 3 stars
Bro can I get legend trophies without signing to legend league plzz reply 🥺🙏
Can you give ur 1 acc townhall 10 or bigger plz
TQ Mr judo
Yes it's work
Thank you bro, these guides are always the best

Couldn’t have done it without you. Thanks man 🤙

Judo is my personal favourite Coc YouTuber because of his humble nature and he never fails to educate us. ️
Hmm blimp drop is so inconsistent literally tried 26 times to get the three star, so much of my life wasted
I tried  it 15 times it didn't  work 😪  fake for this
i 3 star this in my own way but it's hard when ure not used to it i mean th14 bases coz im just th 10 and im praciting alot of strategies lalo is my favorite and now im practicing in this base so i can come up with a plan in the next challenge it's so cool coz coc devs gives us challenge like this it's so fun i really enjoy this
i try the tutorial you made and I mess up a big time but I manage to still 3 star it thank you for the tutorial
*happy barbarian noises

Loving these challenge videos Judo! Congrats on ANOTHER trending vid :)
I just started COC, and i saw an event called Shadow Challenge then I just saw some characters that I didn't know and my mind just blown away about it. So I searched on youtube about the shadow challenge, your vid pop up, watch your video and it was a smooth clear as your video, tried it out, failed so many times, got some progress like got 2 stars and about 99% clear just ran out of time, tried it again and boom! Got it! I felt so happy like its one of my greatest achievement, it got rid of my stresses away, i liked and subribed your channel, thank you so so much bro! I'm so happy right now thanks to you
Thanks events cleared ..

जय श्री राम
Millions trying to follow an inspiration from your attack strats is just mind-blowing :0
I actually messed up a few things, but still managed to 3 ⭐! Thanks "as always"! 😋
Got myself 95% on my own attemts. After a lot of failiore your strategie worked finaly. I think that this was the challenge i struggled the most up to now. Btw ongoing th 11
Thanks iam 2nd time success bro
Just got 3 stars from this strategy. The best i could do was around 90% with the time limit running out, else the queen was still there with her ability intact.  Also what happens when we support a creator.
Took me a few tries but I was finally able to get it thanks
Nailed it, as always, Judo. You're the best!
Always great, easy to follow strategies from Judo.

I’m a TH6 so I definitely didn’t three star it. But I got 91% which is good enough
thank judo, finally i got 3 stars :D
successfully done at my first try. thanks judo
Had a really hard time with this challenge, restarting at least a hundred times to get things just right. So much new principles to learn between town hall 9 and town hall 14. I certainly have a lot more respect for top players now.   Edit: looks like I came up with a completely different plan. I queen walked from the bottom, using the blimp to get the town hall with rage/invis. I sent the hogs, warden and royal champion when the queen got to the single target inferno., and tried to transfer the healers off the queen. It took a lot of attempts and time fails though :')
69% 2 star my first try without watching any videos. I will give this method a try now.
Thanks for this guide i only try once i got 3s..thanks
Finished b4 your video😅
Thanks
I am not a town hall 14 , but I got 2 star with 73% by my own. I learned a lot from you
Thank you judo🥰 it helps a lot
Awesome video as usual 👍👍🍻🍻🍻
You are awesome.... thanks 🙏.. always simple and easy technique
Why It's really hard to get 3 stars?
i dont know what it is but i can never do it i do all the steps and still fail i try 5 times a day and fail idk what im dont wrong
yeeey
Thanks judo,i just finished the challange with 3 stars

thanks
I tried it even tho I'm just th5, i got 60%, I don't know if that's great but, I just wanna share hehe
I love it when judo says easily 3 star
3 stars done
Judo thanks for this type of video's ure best tutor in clash of clans
Im a little bit late but thank as always
Thanks for the faith in us and this tutorial keep up the good work judo
Ended messing up a bit following the strat, but it worked in the end. But as a "nearing max" (still got like, a year according to clash ninja, but my heroes are close) any tips for what you look for in these attacks? As in, like, key targets with a queen charge/walk, and just generally a "basic" strategy to get the 3 star in these challenges (obv the armies are diff, but just the basic ideas of "how to attack" or what to target at what th lvl?)
This works so well
Thank you judo for 3 star
I literally ran out of time which is only for 1 sec. I scored 99% and the clan castle left for only 1 hp !!
Thanks a lot sir i try this it helps a lot thankyou
After about 5 attempts, I've finally got it. Not precisely as you said but it still worked out in the end. Thanks Judo!
Wow your video is on the trending page
Thanks Judo for making us claim the reward with ease 😘

Thank you Judo and Itzu. Got it first time with this tutorial
Thank you Pretty much once again^^
What do you think it does to people that you guys characterize and they’re not even playing do you think evil energies do something real characters or is it the good faith  what energy  plays its part?  Kiddo?????
Done thanks Judo
Bruhhh just attacked without strategy and finished it....
thanks man,I got 3 star on that challenge 😊
Bro thank you so much for this i got 3star in the 1st try

I ended in 99 %
Thanks judo for the tutorial! keep up the content!
Just 2 attempts for one acct other in just one shot  Thanks to Judo and iTzu 😊
Ty bro
Does anyone know how or where to copy that psw vatang challenge base?
i got 3 star by using his strategy
Cool video
FIRST TRY! (with your help) thanks
Tried six or seven times to no avail, and funny thing is I rewatched the video and Judo says "...I have faith in you...", next try through I got it! Thank you!
Congrats on trending! Well deserved Judo!
Im a th10 and i havr no idea about th14 stuff but I still try this challenge on my self without looking at tutorial and I get 2 star 99 percent I can't believe it at my first time
Before i watched this, I only got an 82% two star😆 Thanks👌
I bet judo 3 starred it first try as soon as it dropped
Thanks so much Judo enjoy your videos and appreciate the help 🙏
Bruh I knew that you had to use a queen walk and use sneaky goblins for the funnel and then to take out the eagle artillery with the battle blimp and rage. I might be pro one day
I don’t like the high level bases just because I can’t tell what is what it’s easier when everything is basic
Broo i beat it on my alt account and there was 5 seconds left :skull:
It take me about 13 to 15 tries to 3 star the challenge... And now I see your tutorial it is almost the same way as I did it... U r amazing... I always try to 3 star the challenges before watching any tutorial!!!
Three star first try! Thank you for this!!!
THANK YOU JUDO!!!!!
been getting 70% 2 stars until this vid, took a couple tries but i got it thanks a lot
Thank you for the tutorial I finally 3 star the challenge.....But one question why the eagle doesn't shoot my troops
yes you do it again im your best supporter
Hiiii
This is too much…
Hi judo sloth
Only a max th9 and literally would not have 3 starred this base without this video :D
Subscribe my channel  enjoy more videos
One of my friends challenged me to do it without watching your video 😂 (we are both not TH14) It took me like an hour to barely do it! Thank you very much Judo!
You really helped me out thank you so much!!!
Took a couple of attempts but it worked. As a th10 there's so much going on during the attack, judo makes it look so easy 😂
Its really helpfull for me who had TH 10,  i even dont know what the troops does but its work😂 Thanks Judo u deserve more subs
So Easy Judo, You made it simple!
"Welcome back to the channel then guys, I'm your host Judo Sloth." Legendary
Thanks for the video! Had 29 seconds left on the clock.
This works so well that when I use the Warden ability and heal to early I still 3 starred 😅
Thanks Judo 🙏🏼
So hard not doing it
not gonna lie i watched this video for the accent
#9 on trending! 😳 Well done Judo!
this helped me because I am pretty new and I tried doing multiple ways to get this finished, I had the idea of the battle blimp to the eagle artillery but none of the other stuff XD
Thank you Judo - and Itzu ofcourse - for your tutorial! One thing I like in particular about the 'tutorial-series', is the fact that you can actually play the challenge alongside the steps at the same pace
literally got it with 0 time left
i love you!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need a active clan to join th11
dude i raged so hard on this i did like 50 tries and all the hogs go on the air defense and Im so angry
I have a different strategy an I don't have too use siege blimp
Judo is the best....in the very first attempt I was able to do it even after forgetting to drop the invisibility spell.....you are the best
These new sceneries are sick! Thanks for the tutorial man. Code Judo is active and ere we go!
Took me about 4 tries BUT I got it! With help from your video I was able to 3 star!
Can’t thank you enough for the continued investment in your community success with these guides. Keep up the great work and know we appreciate you!
Is it just me or is his intro one of the best ever
I use code judo
You can tell this was a tough challenge
this is really hard
Took a few tries to get them to destroy the inferno on bottom right after town hall and what not but great guide I hit 90- 99% everytime I failed until they finally moved just right had 6 seconds to spare with the clan castle being last.
thanks judo
thanks mate its worked and got 3 stars
I don't even play clash of clans anymore, i watch ur vidoes cuz i love ur intro! Haha
Hi judo, this is my first time commenting on ur videos and i want to thank you because of u i completed my first event challenge on coc, i did have to memorize all ur steps becuase it was hard while looking at the video and then slowly doing it, so i watched it few times and in my 5th attempt i got 3 stars, again THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!
what a simple man kinda respectful with his great videos much love dude
Since I’m a th9 the scenery look as good because how dark it looks.
Is it just me, or do you have to try so many times that you get the tutorial memorized?
well done
I'm on TH-9 and I took 3 attacks to get 3 stars and on 5th one I saved 23 seconds with 3 stars. Thank you for let me enjoy the TH-14 hard core attack.
85%
Judo: Easily 3 star...... Everyone: **LOUD APPLAUSES**
Dia yg ngetek gampang giliran w mati semua bngsdd.
Thanks so much
Worked smooth...!!!
perfect 3 stars watched the video 3 time and finally at a first attempt bingo
join clan " mega ba11z " clash royale would really appreciate it
Watched this twice, got it on the first try even when forgotten the wall breakers LMAO, thanks :)!!
I did it in just 1 attack thank you judo you are the best
I would have never been able to 3 star without this man
im townhall 7 and i tried 2 times but failed then the third time i did all the steps exactly as told and it was way better but i ran out of time and only got 99%
thanks for this awesome video judo! I usually just use all my hog riders as my main army and use grand warden ability at the th14 but i never use the wizards or archers properly, awesome video and i got 3 stars immediately after watching this video! :)
I am th8 max but I did it in 1st chance
Thanks Judo for helping me! I used alternate lol.
I knew you could do it!!! Hahaha
Tried this a couple times myself as a TH12, my best was 2 stars. Even with your guide, it took me 4 tries but I eventually succeeded. Thanks
My go-to guy for anything clash of clans related my boiiii JUDO

Thank you judo I got the 3 star

I was thinking throughout that your method was very similar to what I saw on iTzu’s channel and then you give the shout out. Looks pretty easy to copy.
Sloth bro ur voice is op and you are unspeakable i love ur behavior thx for

The best youtuber ever...🔥
super helpful thank you
Swear I just saw in top boys??
Thankz judo
Just came back to the game as a TH9, after a 4 year break, so I had no idea what to do. Cleared it on my 3rd try. Thanks for the straightforward and concise video!
Easy in theory, hard in practice.
98% two star time fail on my first attempt and it only got harder after that for some reason, luckily we have 11 days to do it so I'm sure I'll get it eventually
But. Am get three star by using ur tutorial
Thks judo yeah it's little tough
Thank you
Fun fact : Everyone have tried twice or thrice.. But legends try 'uncountable'
Thanks broo
meanwhile th9 me : random bullshit go..🙅🏻😂😂
Super easy.. thanks man..
It is the easiest challenge everrr
I got 2 tries only tnx judo
Completed it first try with ur tutorial with 9 seconds left 😅
thanks mate! first time 3 starred a super cell base.
How abt 1.with 2 balloon and battle blimp u take down left scatter section with rage on yeti from blimp,this will lure cc also.put queen with healers at 3 o clock on camp .use sg to lure all skeleton trap to target queen. After taking down skelly and cc queen will walk down . 2.put king on canon to walk down and then go inside.wall break fot queeen to get access to th section. Use 2hh and rc behind king (pop its ability)also freeze single and warden tower if needed.  3. Start the hogs on eagle side with warden ,use early warden ability then heal when hogs goes towards multi inferno and right scatter shot side. 4.use cleanup asap . I tried this on my 5 ids ,it hella worked but first try it didn't cuz the skelly just stops the hog march. Also use rage and invis for queeen/rc to be alive 😀. Idk how much someone gets it from these lines 😂
Thank you my friend 🥰❤️ for the tips hehhe i got it 3 stars hehe 🥰❤️❤️❤️
Me whenever supercell Gave challenge: why to fear when judo here 👍👍
Great tutorial Judo👍
Nice strategy
This is so much to remember lol
Thank you sob
Nice bro 👏👏👏
Thank you for helping
Thanks judo for the guides!
Me win 83%1☆🤧
These challenge videos tutorials are very helpfull for me who only is a new th12. Thx for the help!
I did it in an unorthodox manner. I deployed 3 hogs each on the cannon and the wizard tower in the south side of the base along with the battle blimp headhunters and the grand warden with 2 rages i was able to take down the town hall the cc and all the heroes along with the whole south quadrant of the base.    Then i sui with king and the queen into one scatter and the supported them with the royal champion charge from the top side of the base and pushed the RC to the middle of the base by using the remaining hogs on the second scatter with the heal spell and was easily to take down the base.  NOTE- I am just a new townhall 12 player...
thanks
Thank you Very much... I was going round and round with 2 stars cuz I'm th 9
APPRECIATE YOUR VIDEO FOR THE CHALLENGE I WAS STRUGGLING TO COMPLETE THAT BUT THEN I WATCH YOUR STRATEGY ITS WAS SATISFYING TO DO I COPY ALL YOUR STRATEGY
I am a th 9 .....did a 80% 1 star in my first attempt😅 without seeing this video
Thank you judo sire your guides are nice and i love your funny way of guiding ❤️love from India 🇮🇳
It worked! I Didn't even need to do anything after the freeze spells
Couldn’t beat any of these as a new player without these. HUGE help!!!
After multiple attempts, I was finally able to successfully destroy the whole base, thanks to you! Although there was some parts I screwed up a little but I managed to get through it anyways haha   Thank you again for this!
Judo master can you upload video for hog rider and miners attack strategy
I have no clue how I understood all of this just in one go. I applied this strategy to this same village. A few tings went different like my archer queen fainted early but I still 3 starred the base.
lol im th7 how am i gonna beat this
Always most reliable guide
It's hard
Thanks bro
I got 90% on my first try thanks to u but I ran out of time 😂
Your guide is really helpful, thanks.
Nice video
Been able to 2 star it first but immediately gave up and watched your video since attempts always got ended by either the town hall or giga bomb  (TH 10 here!!!)
I did it in a completely different way still 3 starred it
Never late to help us thank you 😊
I like how he just goes straight to the point unlike other youtubers who use the half of the video talking about other stuff
Thanks judo, allways coming with great vids. However I have done funnier things than doing this exact thing on seven accounts...
I got it first try when i saw your totorial
Good strategy Judo👍
Judo sloth has the most biggest brain i cant even 3 star a th 7
Thank you for this vid...the challenge was challenging
I came back 2-3 months ago playing COC and you help me with things like this. Your contents is great too since I searched some vids after I came back as a new mid-defense TH 11 owner. Liked and Subscribed btw!

love this so much its so to the point and somewhat easy to replicate keep up the good work judo
Thanks bro
The best strategy from you. Thank u. Just 1 try
I get 2 stars and I use my all strategy but I got only 2 stars but when I see your strategy I done some miner mistakes only. And thanks for helping
This is the nice skine all support judo code
Slothy is getting populer in india 😂
i was try with my own strategy, i was running out of time my strategi is, take the eagle with blim use the queen walk in bottom to take the bottom defense and left scattershot, use the barb king to take heroes and town hall, use RC and some hog to take right scattershot, and use the mass hog and warden to take the other defense
So ein scheiß tutorial digger

I messed up my first attack bcoz I forgot some few things you(judo sloth) thought, then I watched it again.

Hello Judo I am a fellow clash of clans player town hall 10 and nearly max I have max gold *8 500 000* and in 1 and a half days I will have 4 builders and it can go 3 ways and I'm hear to ask on advice     1 I can upgrade my bomb towers and get them out of the way but I will have barley any loot   2 upgrade my wizard towers I have 3 that need upgrading two are level 7 and one is level 8 and is alot more costly than the bombs but takes longer which is beneficial     3 walls, half of my walls are level 11 (max for town hall 10) other half are level 9 and a mix are level 10 this will be very costly and will give me no time to get loot although I can use elixir I need that for troops    Kindest regards    Youtuber name: Ffantasy  CoC name : epic clan
Lov u bro from India
please judo one request never change intro welcome back and that song🥺❣
I used a different strategy. Blimp from 10 o'clock to take down the scattershot and luring out cc troops. Queen walk from 6 0'clock assisted with headhunters and spells to take down the whole bottom compartment including TH and King from the 3 o'clock to take care of teh other scattershot. Hogs from above with Warden and RC. Am a TH12 player but learnt from pro players from Eric's channel. Good content though Judo keep it up!
Wow, nice👍 Thank you
Your the best judo❤️

Thanks judo sloth for helping us. I have completed the challenge. If you don't give us tutorial we can't do this. Thanks a lot again.
noticed that everytime a new challenge drops, the warden's starting mode is the very opposite of what you(and kenny jo) reccomend for the attack.   Coincidence? I think not!
Thank you

I’m currently in legend league as a TH10 player attacking TH14s for 1 star. Feels so good to actually attack a TH14 as a TH14 😅🖤
Big fan of you
Without seeing your video it never complete for me .
Thankyou mate
Thanks judo
Nice i love it but there is a much easier strategy which is to just spam everything in the top corner and use the spells  when: - hogs go to the left, use a heal - keep freezing the th and the infernos when they are attacking too many troops at once - 3 rages in the middle and the last one to help barb king clean up cause he might die if you dont use that rage - poison for the middle where are a few heroes
Man how do you come up with these easy and friendly strategy always? It's really working. Thanks man
Judo is the one you can rely on for these challenges

Best of luck with the Challenge! The TH14 Challenges can be tough if you’re not that level usually so stick with it, you get unlimited tries. Also a huge thanks to iTzu Gaming for helping with the strategy, be sure to show him some love!   Where Does $500 Get You on a New Account: https://youtu.be/gNcd-lW8ASo
