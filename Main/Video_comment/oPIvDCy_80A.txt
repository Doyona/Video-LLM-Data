Please take this video down Lena. Your daughter will someday be a grown women… and will realize that nothing in her life has been treated as private or sacred. I ache for her. Please take her off the internet. It’s not safe.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I love your name Lena❤
It freaks me out how momma doesnt hold the babies head in place at all times!
hilarious watching this after Jason Luv wrecked her holes
That’s such a cute push present, I’m so glad it was sentimental and not a extravagant luxury item 😊
Feeling bad for the baby 😢
thats not adams thats bbc's
Adam will pimp his kid at 16
I know all bout being ichy bad. It’s not from the opiate. It’s basically definitely the epidural because I’ve taken opiates too and you get a little itchy, but nothing like the epidural and it will last for hours so glad you got through it.
Nurse said "are you recording?" Lol
I did the same thing you’re going through I can dilate past three for hours and hours and hours over 24 hours for sure I’ve had three C-sections it’s not that bad I’m sure you know that by now bless you and your family
Awww Tony 🤍 rewatched this video this morning so cute 🥰 🍼
Aww I loved this
the nurse asking if lena likes baby as if she’s one of the popular girls testing out if lenas cut to be one of them😭😭
Lena.n Adam I wish ur family happiness and long life and Parker🐣🧿🪆🎀🇦🇲 shat urax ev Bari kyank..!!!!
I’m seriously aweing!! She’s so beautiful Lena!
I had similar experience. No pain medication. Apparently some of us just have EXTREMELY hospitable wounds and our babies are content to just chill…Colorado doesn’t allow home birth beyond like 3 days of labor no matter how determined the mother is. Maybe in Kentucky woods or something I could have but Denver, Colorado. Nope.
I just luv the baby noises 🥰🥰
Bruh i saw the video of her and trisha now wonder yall are over due
Seeing Lena just take it like a champ going home ignoring the pain she’s going through .. women are so incredible ...
Oh my goodness she looks just like Adam! Lol
This video made me so happy I love you and Adam been watching since day one! So so happy for y’all. She’s beautiful
Cutest ever 🥰🤍✨
She is a beautiful newborn most newborns look like old men but she is precious
Aww
Congratulations!!! and I CANT "do you like, do you like her?" is that a quote from Mean Girls or somethin y'all as parents are the most heart warming thing <3
Awww they’re gonna cherish these videos so much!
When she said I wanted you forever I started ballinggggg so adorable😭😭😭😭
Adam I hate you for the milk jug lmao😂😂😂
Lol the whole milk cover up is awesome haha
6:28 “Do you like her”?!?!? WHAT???? I had to rewind it back because I was certain that I was hearing things wrong! 😒 No, I’m not really liking this one. Can you bring me a few other options to choose from, please?😂😂😂
I didn’t see this at the time! Aaw she’s so cute, she has beautiful big eyes.. congratulations guys!
He is so cute oh my God she's like a princess and she's pretty too look at that beautiful princess baby so cute.  AWWWWWWWWWWWW
We need more videos!!
They always claim u need a last min c section, docs love to cut.
My son was born on my sisters bday and she said the same. Now her bday can be forced on him instead of her.
May god bless you both and don't let the baby feel lonely if you there with her.
Parker is beautiful 😍
I didn't get itchy with my epidural. That's so weird you must have been having an extremely allergic reaction to it.
When r u uploading your next videos
Never was ITCHY ? ? ? Nor anyone I know . congrats
She has Lena's eyes and your bald head. Awesome you guys.  She's beautiful and you both finally experienced what it is like to Create a life and  truly know what true unconditional love is.  Congratulations

Adam you’re definitely lucky to have these girls in your life 💕
Cute Baby, and your Cat just wanted to say hi
Its kinda sad when people have kids, they start to neglect their animals...the animals don't have the same status anymore and are ignored
Good job Lena! You made a whole new person.❤️
Did that nurse seriously just ask if Lena likes her? It’s her new born child of course she likes her or loves her.... what kind of question is that?!
Fr a copy and paste of her dad<3

That's a big baby !
She's absolutely precious. Mazel tov 💙💙💙
That kid is gonna need to stay off the Internet for the rest of her life unless she wants life time trauma therapy.
If they gave you meds for group B strep that makes you HELLA itchy
💕💕 omg, Adam & Lena congratulations on your baby girl!
Best parents ever. Adorable
Omg the baby is so adorable 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish someone could have documented Adam’s initial reaction too 💕 bc Lena’s reaction was priceless and beautiful!
Hey Adam ,      I wanted to be the first to Welcome you to the New Father Club, I know you will find the road to graduating to Bad ass father, and get a Father of the Year award! Congratulations 🎊 man seriously you will love the next 6 years will change you for the rest of your Life!
She's such a cutie pie my god 😻😻😻💞💞💞
Adam don't wear your mask backwards bro even though it doesn't really matter anyways you're not around people
You both are goals congrats on the new little one
Agreed.
I had the balloon too and I was a WEEK over due date. After I got the Balloon it dialted me and needed an emergency c section. It's horrible but congrats!!!
I love that Parker and her grandpa have the same birthday. My grandfather and I have the same birthday and it is such a gift.
From his father?🤔🙄
Love love love! I’m expecting my first baby in May and I love watching your pregnancy videos 💕
I dont have any social media so i was just thinking about yall and wanted to come say i hope yall are doing well!!
Omg she absolutely PERFECT!!! I never comment, but HAD to on this one. I literally caught myself smiling at your precious angel & the awe of love you both have. I know it was a month ago...well almost 2 months ago...but I cannot get over how perfect & beautiful Miss Parker is. Congratulations! I KNOW you are an amazing mom & Adam is an amazing dad. I can only imagine how much she has changed & your world has changed already in these 2 months. Much love to all of you! Oh & I hope Tony is adjusting well. 😉
Congrats guys!! She's gonna be so cute
I can FEEL the love they have for her & each other😻
Hey Adam, vaginal births aren't the best type of births. F you. There is no best type of birth. The only thing to worry about is that both baby and mom are doing well. A C section saved my life. Also congratulations on your baby.
I hate kids but thats one cute pizza roll. I mean baby.
Hey bro I bet being in that operation room was crazy as shit I’m 19 and I have two lil girls my self congratulations man it’s a whole different ball game now
Omg Adam is too cute!!! Congrats guys!!
Oh my god I AM SOBBING 😭❤️
She looked just like adam when they were on bed
Lena “I’m tired” Adam “on mad drugs”
This is so heartwarming god bless your beautiful little family ❤️
Congrats guys. She’s adorable
Aww so cute ❤️. Congrats to you ✨  I’m not a mom but now that I’m in my early 20s I can see why people say a baby will change your life .
That bassinet is extremely cool. Nice pick!
I just want to watch lena without hearing Adam bc i hate him.
WHERE R THE VLOGS?! Y’all pleaseeeee start blogging🥲
Parabéns pelo bebê 🌹😘👏👏👏👏👏
Awe your baby looks soo mature emotion wise, the smiling is just precious!!
You are soo brave! I'm sitting here scared and i't not even me,,,hahah you act like the pain of birth is no biggie..hahah girl #strong
wow i’m obviously biased but the name parker fits your family so well, parker adam and lena sounds so good together
Parker and I have the same bday!! Twins!!!
Why did I feel my heart stop when the nurse said, "are you recording?" As if im the one.
Aweeeeee dat sweet baby congratulations 😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰💖💖💖💖
Her little coos 😍😍😍
Congrats Lena and Adam ❤️
Babies usually look like aliens when they are born .. but Parker is BEAUTIFUL... she is so precious
I also became a mom this year. So far, I honestly fucking love being a mom😇
I never got itchy from epidural that's from opiates lol congratulations tho ❤️🙏🥰🙌💯
My grandma is in her 70s and she worries soo much about all of us kids. The motherly love and worrying never goes away
She's adorable! And so alert!! Congratulations guys, she's perfect!! 💟👣🍼
As a medical provider, it is so endearing to see patients that THINK they know more than the doctors and will put a baby at EXREME risk by being stubborn and bull headed when it comes to their demands based on something they have read on the internet.
I started itching watching you itch
she is truly beautiful  Seriously huge congratulations to you both sensing lots of love to you all  from Scotland 💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤
Stop scratching 😅
did the nurse just ask “do you like her”?!?! like what😂
I want to cry! Congratulations ❤️
The cooooing!!! I have baby fever now
she’s born on my nephews birthday! ❤️❤️
That’s one cute ass baby
So happy for you both and girl sorry you went through all the crap and hard pregnancy congratulations girl
Please do more videos like this one, all three of you and Toni too lol
I had both of my kids all natural with no epidural
I dont understand the itching from epidural i had an epidural and i did not itch at all but it was an early delivery and i was also on a large amount of magnesium to stop labor
It’s honestly a bit strange (not in a bad way) bc I know Lena and Adam from what they do for a living, but I feel this goes to show no matter what industry you work in, you’re a person and it’s so dumb when people make other people less than bc of that. Other than that, congrats on baby Parker!!!!
Epidural is in a pain killer .. it sounds like she is allergic to the epidural
She's pure perfection 🤗
Did the nurse really ask if you liked your baby!!!!???? What kind of question is that!? Lol
Doin Skin to skin was one of my favorite parts when my son was born
Parker is so adorable a precious angel
Honestly what a beautiful baby and couple 🥺

So crazy finally being able to see her I'm so happy for you two!💛
Congratulations! She is so adorable. I definitely got baby fever

Congratulations Lena and Adam <3
Had an epidural for all three kids, it only worked for one. The other two, they hit bone several times over, bruising my back terribly but didn't successful administer the medications so I felt everything lol When it worked, it didn't make me itchy, just a bit nauseated and it made me shake like crazy!!!
Super happy for y’all! she most deff is gonna have a jumper💯
her eyes are so big 🥺
No one cares Adam lol
Wtf how the doctors ask if they like her 😂😂it’s her daughter no duh
Wow, it's so nice to see the baby bringing out the loving side of Adam. He seems so much more loving towards Lena too. It's so sweet and unexpected to see! Congratulations to both of you for the healthy baby girl, can't wait to see her growing up! I'm sure she will be gorgeous and funny.
Omg what a beautiful new born!!! So happy for y’all
OMG!! You look pretty 👑 but i can feel your pain
What date was the baby born
This baby is destined for Only Fans
I was 2cm for like 48hrs, got the pitocin and the gel they put on your cervix and then bam! I'm not even kidding when I say it happened fast, I tried to roll over to hang my legs off the bed and I felt the head coming out.  It was fucking horrific, I never even had time for the morphine to kick in properly and the birth happened so fast, by the time he was out I was high af lol.  Its such a surreal experience, I'm do happy for you guys!  I've been a fan since way back and I can't believe you're parents now 😢 she's beautiful ❤
SHE IS ADORABLE
she looks so much like adam!
Omg 😧 those big eyes!!!! ❤️ so happy for you mamas
Congratsssss!!! Sooo happy for you guys 😭 can’t wait to see ur little bean/fam growwww
the way the baby looks at adam omg i cant stop crying someone slap me
SHIULD HAVE LIVE STREAMED THE WHOLE THING ON BITWAVE
WHERE Can we find the Uncensored Version?????
the nurse in the background “do you like her” like it’s a normal question to ask... like “nehhh can i have a different one?” lol
your story is very similar to my sisters birth of her son earlier this year. Question is did they deny giving you pitocin, or was it even offered? My sister was supposed to get pitocin once she arrived at the hospital but a doctor (not her original) recommended a balloon (same thing also happened) then epidural and then she had to undergo a quite dangerous C-section (previously had a c-section). So she was in labor about 12 hours longer than she should have been.  But otherwise congratulations! I hope you are healing well and don't feel like all your organs are jingling around lol!
Are you recordi~  Adam: Yes, Yes I am
This is so beautiful and emotional to watch. She is so beautiful. Congrats Lena and Adam, you guys will be wonderful parents!
What was the reasoning behind the name Parker for a girl?
Lena, Parker is absolutely beautiful! She is such a lucky girl to have you as her Mummy. Cherish every second when she is tiny, as she will grow up so quickly. Thank you for sharing such a precious moment ❤️
there's lots of stigma around c-sections being the "easy way out" and a lot of people forget it's a MAJOR SURGERY that cuts very important muscles in your abdomen. YOU DID AMAZING LANA!! I hope you heal up well and your baby girl is absolutely beautiful ♡
How in the world can she feel her legs itching after having the epidural? Lol. I couldn't feel crap from my waist down.
This hit me hard man this feels like i actually know u guys but she fsho got adams nose ! Take care of all u guys especially tony ! Dont forget about the og tony 😂
She’s so beautiful! So calm and chill - what a good baby!
She deffo has Lena's eyes 🥺😍😍😍
I've never seen a baby with such beautiful eyes omg
She’s beautiful congratulations!
This was the most silent birth vlog I've ever seen in my life
lol my mom constantly retells the story of my birth: her vagina ripped horribly and had to be stitched, she contracted very bad influenza at the hospital and one of her mammary glands got infected and had to be surgically removed. And then I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 1 years old. And my dad left. Fun. She says she doesn’t remember the first months of having me at all, she was so out of it 😂
Lena I was wondering wheres your baby . Your so beautiful . Your baby is so cute shes adorable gorgeous little baby .  Im soo happy for you ❤
Congratulations to u guys
She's so beautiful
Omg that's a baby. Crazy. Congrats you guys, I can't wait to watch her grow and see her personality develop. Absolutely insane a new chapter has begun in your lives, and I hope it last a long, long, long time.♥
I am so happy for you both. When I saw her, I teared up. She is beautiful!
This makes me so excited for my baby to arrive in early March 🥺🥺
What a BEAUTIFUL baby. Omg
why tf the nurse ask 'do you like her' its her baby not a new pair of shoes lmaoooo
So happy for y’all! ❤️ She’s so beautiful 😍
this is so beautiful
The first video I watched was the why I’m still pregnant and I had to find out if she had come yet or not.
How big was she?
She is so beautiful you guys 🥺
12:54 - 13:00 You can already see Adams DNA in that tiny face. Very happy for the 3 of you. Much love.
So basically they give you drugs then you breast feed the baby? So technically that baby is doped up to the nines on his first day on Earth and we wonder why we have so many mental illnesses 😢😢
Awesome Work ✌️
congratulations & best wishes!!!
I was the same way with my epidural.
Congratulations mum and dad! And well done to lena for breastfeeding, whether you do it for 1 day or 100 you're doing amazingly x
omg such a strong mama
OMG Congratulations guys!!!!!!!!!!! She looks so wonderful, a beautiful mix of both of you! It's definitely a new and powerful phase for yo guys and I wish the best energy! Much love from Brazil!
I don’t think I have ever seen adam softer in my entire existence watching him ! I’m so happy for Lena, she’s glowing 🎊🎊🎀 beautiful bright eye baby
Omg Adam as a daddy is so much more precious then I thought. So happy for you Lena ! Go mama ! Handling it like a boss
Best time of my life my little girl Xmas morning best gift ever!!!!
My 1st day home with my 1st son was the most loving/crazy/scary time i had ever experienced! I was only 17 and nooo idea what i was doing but i knew i was in complete love! He is about to be 13 now 😭 my sweet boy ❤
Very cute. So happy for you both :)
Beautiful baby ❤️❤️
Good for y’all man Adam just a cool dude and Lena a cool chick I don’t usually like the YouTube family stuff but this is cool
She's beautiful! Congrats mama!!
Spinal
BABY JU JU!!!!!!!!
Congratulations Yall🗣
I was forced into a c-section girl. My plan all along was to have my baby natural, until I got to the hospital. The moment you have the epidural, your lower body is numb, therefore, you will not be able to contract. $10,000 for natural birth vs. $30,000 + for c-section. They convinced me I needed an epidural =( They told me the EXACT same thing. I only was at 3 CM and that the baby was in danger. This is all part of their act. My baby ALSO has the same birthdate as my father! And your baby has MY birthday! Scorpios are the BEST!  I'm glad you and the baby are doing great! xoxo
I had almost the exact same thing happen to me! I was in labor for 28 hours with the balloon, I wouldn’t dilate past 7cm and had to get a c section
Congratulations!
omg shes BEAUTIFUL 💜💜💜💜
shes so calm and adorable awww. "its not about you tony" haha
Seeing your journey has been so wonderful. Now seeing Adam so in love with her and Lena so at peace. Congrats guys
In and out of sleep
Our labors were exactly the same to the T. Planned for an all natural calm birth w no stress. Ended up the complete opposite . From the 2cm , itches, panick attack to our daughters look like there Dad.... Thank God someone shares the same story as me other people are in complete shock when I tell them my labor storey, Glad to here your Normalize it we dont here it enough, Birth is hard and you did an amazing  job mama  congratulations to the three of you Every aspect of life gets way more exciting now!!! 🥰😍❤
her eyes are so big and bright, cutieee!1
She’s gorgeous! Congratulations Lena and Adam!! I
She’s so beautiful!! Congrats to both of you 💞
Shes absolutely adorable 😍
Why on earth would a nurse ask do you like her? What a dumb thing to say.
OMG so cute😍
She is one of the few infants thats only a couple days whose so gorgeous and doesnt look like an old man for first few days, shes truly so beautiful. So proud of you i didnt want to have a C section either Lena but you did the best you could and what was right for you and baby as we mothers always try to do great job Adam as well. Reminds me so much of my husband and our 2nd daughters c section he was with her at beginning since i wasnt in good condition and neither was our babes at the time. Love you guys fast healing blessings. I could not get out of bed the 1st or 2nd they forced me on 3rd so you go Lena!!
Ur packing bro
You’re doing great, depends on the person but I had twins and my c section was a dream. Our babies came out so perfect, little chubby angels. Prayers & thoughts with you mama! Go team! Happy you have such a supportive man by your side, my mama straight up left the OR with the babies and left me on the table. She got iconic photos of my whole intestines and such lol 😂 those are for a different baby book   Edit: yes all the cakes!!!!! That’s so special
Congrats bro! The itches are the best part Lena.
The way Lena just cant stop staring at her...ugh just made me tear up 🥺🥺 you can just feel the motherly love
Congrats Adam and Lena! I've been watching Adam on no jumper for like 8 years it's crazy to see him with a lil kid now🤧
Awwww she is beautiful omg you two are gonna be great parents rest up lena i'm so happy for you guys she is so precious 🥺🥺🥺🥺 she's got big beautiful eyes
Weird as my epidural didn't make me itchy. However some pain killers do so it could be the pain relief rather than the spinal block
Ugh when they insert the balloon it hurt SO BAD. But I fee like it made me dialated so fast
Congrats from a 2 c section mama!!!! 🖤🖤🖤 and YES to the itchiness it was painfully itchy lol
Looks like Adam. Congratulations to you both. She's beautiful
That baby is adorable
Congrats you guys!! ✨💖💞 Update: I’m literally crying shes so precious omg 🥺🥺💖✨
Oh this made me so emotional. My daughter is almost 4 and it feels like yesterday I was going through all of these emotions
What dumb ass nurse asked “Do you like her?” Wtf
what’s the name
Freaking beautiful 😫😢💜 instant baby shot was perfect 😍
When your baby's heart rate drops that shit is so scary. I'm so grateful my body kicked in and I could avoid the emergency csection by the skin on my teeth. Like Lena said you do what you have to for your situation. Birth plans change and that's ok. She's beautiful & perfect, Congratulations Lena & Adam!!!
'' do you like her '' ? wtf
When the nurse asked “do you like her” I lost it😂 what kind of question is that?
I’m so happy for you guys! She is adorable! Welcome to parenthood 🥰
aww she's beautiful!!
Shes adorable. Congratulations guys 😍
The baby is beautiful for being a newbie!
Same exact thing happened with me when I was pregnant with my first baby had to get induced they tried everything to get my labor going because I was not liking the idea of even having a c-section as a possibility epidural didn't make me itchy it did make me feel like I was going to throw up I felt no pain when it was time to push I pushed four times 15 minutes and he was born super easy labor and delivery but getting dilated to 10 that was the only thing that basically was holding stuff u back now with my second child epidural did not work also had her in four pushes 16 minutes but it hurts so freaking bad I think that's why it only took me four pushes cuz I pushed with all my freaking might!!! Plus I did not want my baby to be like in the birth canal long cuz I didn't know what him and her have a conehead...
It's the downer itch I had a hysterectomy and I think it wont be too difficult to handle...but maybe that's because I had my uterus removed..and a c section has to heal more What a beautiful baby!!!
Wow sweet
she is beautiful 😍 congratulations!!!! after a c section she is walking like anything
Gentle
This is a dope rap video intro
Homie baby
Fallout boy
Nos Ballón
I remember when Adam told the rope gang that no women can "tame this lion" when we kept asking about Lena and him hanging out in thr vlogs... Now look at him lol
She’s beautiful. Congratulations you guys 💘
14 years later: das why i got yo moms onlyfans
Omg, I cannot believe how beautiful both of the girls are! Ok, and Adam in his surgical garb. 👏🏻👏🏻😍🥰🥰
I’m so so so so thankful you both decided to go to the hospital. I was so worried about Lena and the baby being overdue. I’m glad you have a healthy mom and most importantly a healthy baby. Congratulations ❤️

You could have still had a natural birth if you didn't choose to use the epidural. No hate I don't blame you.

Lena! She is so beautiful and so alert! You look amazing ,I’m just so happy for you.
I'm gonna be having my first baby in June of next year 😭💖💖 I'm so happy for you 💖 Your baby girl is so cute 😭💖
Watching this as a labor nurse and seeing the baby’s decel on the monitor 😖 can anyone relate lol
That’s crazy!! She doesn’t look like a newborn. What a difference 2 weeks makes
They did not ask IF YOU LIKE HER. What a motherb*tchin question is this. Like you’d answer „No I don’t but whatever“.
she’s so beautiful ♥️♥️♥️♥️ congratulations 🥰
The epidural made me soooo itchy and I had no warning lol I begged a friend to bring me a comfy blanket cause the hospital blanket was making it so bad & I got a fuzzy blanket life saver lmao sounds weird but next time a fuzzy blanket is a essential for me lmao
you two are gonna be great parents ❤️ so happy for your family!
DO YOU LIKE HER HAHA
I love this video you guys are already the best parents! Can’t wait to see more
omg you guys look so natural as parents so calm
She just had a baby and still looks good. You should of seen my bm .....
I cry. This is so cute. I’m so so so happy for you guys
I really hope this changes their lifestyle.
She has beautiful big eyes!
I love yall and how comfortable you both are with yourselves
The balloon is the fucking devil. Hopefully she got it after the epidural so she didn’t feel how painful that thing is.
Lena took that like a beast I remember my mom bed ridden for a week after having my little brother, beautiful baby
Why does this newborn baby look like a wise old woman?
Congratulations bro! I'm very happy for you and Lena.
That worried feeling never goes away as a parent. We are 2 years in and all you will do is fall more in love with her. Its amazing now to watch this and relate so much to it. Just remember she will sleep well eventually and once you are in a routine things will get much easier.
CONGRATS
fuck ! now i need a baby too
Omg that’s my hospital!!! Good job Lena 💞
Wow Lena & Adam, congratulations. She just might be the most beautiful baby I've ever seen. I can tell just what amazing parents you'll be. ❤
So damn cute 😍 congratulations guys
Beautiful baby! Congratulations to you both!
You need to support her head
Omf I’ve never seen a pretty newborn but she is perfect and so small omgggg
anyone else surprised adam didnt name the baby CELINA for clickbait? lmao
The nurse said “do you like her” 😂😂😂
One of the worst parts about being addicted to painkillers was being itchy all the fucking time. I would have scabs all over my body from itching so much. Drug addiction is disgusting
She is so beautiful, congratulations <3
I am crying
Omg 😍 she’s her dad’s twin!
oh my goodness, she is beautiful! Congratulations on being a mommy and daddy!!
Omg I’m due in 6 weeks and every birth vlog just makes me cry my eyes out 😭❤️
Wassup Adam. Let’s give a shoutout to all the babies 👶

Oh my gosh I passed out too for my c-section but it was cause of all the pain!!
I knew I shouldn’t have watched this 😭❤️

Nobody prepared me for the pain in recovery after the c section. Omfg. The burning!!!! Congratulations love !!
She. Is. Beautiful. Congrats. You’ll love being parents. The first two years are hard, but beautiful. My son is three and there are new challenges but she will amaze you. LOVE YOU GUYS!
Sounds like shit nurses and midwives ngl
I had my c-section a week ago and I only dilated up to 3cm also! Pitocin made my contractions BAD and they lasted a minute to a minute and a half back to back. Also my epidural didn’t make me itchy at all. I got numb so fast. Also didn’t get to actually hold my baby till after recovery. Like an hour or 2 later.
The nurse asking “do you like her?” Is a level of awkwardness I can totally relate to! 🥴🤣 CONGRATS!!
I was smiling throughout this whole video. Congrats Lena and Adam!!🤍
😢😍 omg congratulations 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕

Congrats nigga
Do they say why they had to get a C-Section?
HER EYESSSS😭😭 just like lena’s 🥺
Never heard Adam sound so happy after the birth on his podcast. Poor Lena is allergic to morphine. Congrats new parents ❤
Congratulations,  you two! Lena, you are a Goddess on Earth. My husband and I love you guys and your family. Your baby is gorgeous.
This is exactly what happened to me I was actually 3 weeks late but I wouldn't go past a 3 and they wanted me to push I was like no I'm not able to and I had to have a c section but mine didn't go as planned cause of my back I have some issues so they couldn't get the spine tap in and it was so scary. But iv had 2 c sections and honestly it wasn't that bad to recover definitely don't push your self to much and stay in bed the first 2 days.
not to be dramatic but i would die for her🥺🥺🥺 yall are such a cute family bless you zz
Congratulations!!!!!!
She is beautiful!!! Congratulations Lena and Adam!!!
Luckily my epidural didn’t make me itch! But I also  didn’t need Pitocin  Also- even if you did natural delivery you would have to take care of yourself too.. trust me. Natural delivery isn’t a walk in the park, especially if you rip like I did.  I labored for 36 hours in active labor un medicated and I absolutely did feel like an animal! It’s unlike anything else and it’s the exact reason I’ll NEVER have another kid lol
The only video I watched every second of🥰 so  perfect... congratulations
She’s so adorable she looks like both of you and wow she came out smiling most babies don’t smile until the are like 3 months old she already and over achiever like her parents lol and I love the name Parker I never would have guessed that plz do a video on her full name and why you chose it also how much did she weigh and how tall was she when she was born!!
Gosh with for teen kids and can’t have more thought I was content but omg she is beautiful and makes me so clucky 💞 guess I will wait for grandkids!!
I’m soooo not used to seeing this side of Adam
she is adorable. i love her. you two are already the best parents!
She’s so pretty like wtf and Lena looks so beautiful even on pain killers lol
Congrats guys! I'm glad she's healthy and everything went well in the end!
Oh my goodness she was wide awake when she came out 🥺🥺🥺🥺 I love her ❤️
Congrats on becoming pause🙌 parents
wow !congratulations on the beautiful baby girl! as im watching this i cannot believe just how much this is all my birth story for my first son. i wanted all the same things lena wanted and i also was almost 2 weeks late and i also wanted home birth all natural but i also woulnt dialate either and i had to have an emergency csection as well. i cannot believe how mirrored this was
Omg I was told to never get pitocin it makes it extra painful and 9 out of 10 times it turns into a csection bc of pitocin. Anyways, glad she’s healthy  Congrats 🎉 such a blessing !
she is the cutest baby I have ever seen wow congratulations adam and lena!!
Awww she is precious!!!! Love her, congrats guys
Congrats guys xo Shes freakin' booootiful
https://youtu.be/FAHjvop5A5E
Omg she looks like lena 😭😭😭😭😭
Yeah i was in labor for 17 hours planning no drugs water birth, 19 hrs induced and epidural then boom needed an emergency c section because she was sunny side up. Im so glad ur ok heal fast momm C sections are also waaayy easier then you think. My friends ripped from her vagina to her ass and had 14 stiches I had c sections on all my babies and its amazing when you get to skip labor and choose a c section from the get go.
My son and I share a birthday, he’ll be 1 in two months😭
The balloon is sooo uncomfortable just thinking about it makes me cringe
SHES SO CUTE STOP
most people will say congrats because they cant spell congrajjulations
I could stare at her all day. So beautiful! Congratulations!🎈🍾🎉🎊
Was literally just talking about how I never want kids and then I saw this video and got emotional and started daydreaming about the day I get to hold my little own, ihms😭🥺
😍😍😍💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ash the name Parker is so cute
She is really so cute and alert. YOUR hair is so shiney. I had 6 C sections.
Congratulations, you guys will be amazing parents 🥰
Every time Lena said “She’s so sleepy” I 🥺
Congrats you two! So beautiful!! 🥲🥰❤
Congratulations! She is so cute 😭
Alwas hold the babies head
Genuine question: How are you moving your legs after having an epidural!? I was basically paralyzed from the waist down when I got mine
😹😹😹😹😹 love it!!!
Omg I love these guys!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Congratulations y'all 🍼
is it me or is she not supporting that baby’s head at all
That's your twinnn
she couldn’t have came out any more gorgeous
me before watching this video: I don’t want to have any kids 😤  me after watching this video: .....maybe just one 🥺.....
Adam is so adorable with her.  Congrats. 🎉💐 She's beautiful. 😍❤️
She is so beautiful you guys, congratulations. Welcome to the world Parker! ❤ 🤍 💙 🧡
THE NURSE SAID “DO YOU LIKE HER”  BITCH WHAT!!!!
SOOOOO ITCHY, and sick!!!
When everything in life becomes clear.......Congratulations she is beautiful! You guys are naturals already!
Soooo adorable omg I love it! Please be careful with the cats around the baby. I had a friend who’s cat got inside the bed with her baby and was way to close for her liking just want to make sure you pay attention to the cats and them climbing in the bed or snuggling to close to baby and her tiny face! Love you two so blessed amazing god bless your new family!!❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏽👶🙏🏿👶
Both of you are naturals already - congrats mom and dad - she’s gorgeous ❤️

6:53 lmao 😂 great edit.
Did a dang hospital worker ask Lena if she “liked” her own baby? Lmao tf? As a nurse that weirded me out lol 😂
you dont even know how lucky you are to be there with her!! mothers had to be alone throughout the birth of their child this whole quarantine
I had to get one and now I’m so grateful I got a c~section
Lena literally went through the exact same thing as I did minus the c section! Congrats you guys!
Omg your baby is soo adorable !!! When I went I to labor my daughters heart rate went down  2 times , so while I was waiting to open up more her heart rate went down 1 time and then I was like around 7-9 centimeter and then that’s when her heart rate went down so I had to get an emergency c section and that was kinda scary I  was out the whole time during it but my fiancé says I was talking and asking like is the baby ok but I don’t remember much from it lol I would say my recovery was good and fast from the c section , hope you have a speedy recovery 🤗💞
Support her damn head!!! Geez!!!!
She is so beautiful and precious💗. How are you walking around so easy girl? After my c-sections I felt like my stomach was being ripped apart when I moved around and got up and down.
I literally could not stand up or sit down without assistance after having my C-section
That baby is such a DOLL!! Congrats... 💝 this was a beautiful vlog
Awww shes the cutest
What's her name?
The smile🤩
Well I’m happy your able to breast feed I know you were like 30% worried about that🥳🥳😏🥳

Congrats Adam and Lena. I have a few of my own... that i want some day (office joke hehe).
IF u guys are into it there is a thing called Owlet Smart Sock and it monitors all of your baby's vitals while she sleeps so you don't have to be on edge so much while you are trying to sleep at night.It basically will sound an alarm off on this device u keep by your bed if anything unusual happens with her breathing, heart rate,etc.
I've been following since you announced your pregnancy, and it's so joyous to get to watch this. Wishing you the best of luck!
this is soo inspiring. I loved how yu were like "This is a weird headspace to be in to do this?" I TOTALLY get that!
Congratulations!👶  Shes so beautiful and precious! Such an amazing blend of you two. Welcome to the world sweet baby girl.🥰👋
she is finally here!! happy for the both of you and your families!
How she going to ask “you like her” ngl that got me mad like tf ?

You two are such great parents ❤
Congrats 🖤 She is precious.
The nurse did not just ask “do you like her?” Are you serious 😂
baby parker
Omg that is a beautiful baby 🥺 congratulations!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
The epidural made me SUPER itchy. I was 2 weeks late as well and had to have a c section. I was induced 2 days before they decided to give me the surgery. I couldn’t get to 10cm and babies heart stopped with every contraction. I was set on having a natural birth so I didn’t get the epidural until 2 hours before my surgery. Didn’t get to kick in before getting in so I passed out from pain during the procedure. Healed fast and gave baby all my attention though !
"do you like her?" Like "yeah I guess she aight"🤣🤣🤣 tf
*Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double 15 second no skip ads!*
Congrats bud!
"Do you like her" 😂😂😂😂 nah can we swap her out for another? Obviously she likes her 😂😂😂
Oh my gosh that colic baby noise yt channel is always on in my house lol  Congrats you two💖
Adam said he's a great BF so he's going to be a great Dad. 2021 maybe you can up it to Great Husband 💍
Get the owlet sock monitor... It was great piece of mind for my wife... It measures heart beat... It's not perfect but took the nervous edge off my wife when the baby slept
Kid for money shame
Having a kid.  And post. SHOCKING.  be good to the kid. Stay off the net.  Weordos
Me and my girl literally went through this same process besides the c-section
Trash
My heart oh my goodness
I cannot believe she was standing up, chilling, the morning after her c-section. Maybe it's just bc I wasn't on painkillers, but I couldn't stand without screaming for like a week
I’m not even gonna front your baby is so cute!!! And easy going. God bless u guys hope everything works out for u guys!!
Hi, Nice channel!!!!  look my channel too 🇧🇷 💛💚

Name her "Riley Reid"...
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
Congrats! 🎉

Lena is a CHAMP she made it look easy
The news media in China is censored, but one can still get a glimpse of the Chinese Communist Party's brutality from the filtered reports that conform to the CCP's narratives.  A Chinese woman living in Japan flew back to China for a heart transplant. Within 10 days, she was provided with four hearts, one after another. As this news was widely reported in China boasting the ample supply of organs, medical professionals began to question the source of these organs, as reported by National Review in an article on August 13 titled “More Evidence of ‘Organs on Demand’ System in China.”  “China has been repeatedly and credibly accused of organ harvesting the Falun Gong and other political prisoners, usually for the black market, in which rich foreigners needing a transplant travel there and buy their lives at the cost of ending someone else’s,” wrote Wesley J. Smith in the article. “It is an evil trade, and one for which China should be shunned by the international community.”  Citing an article titled “4 Hearts in 10 Days: China’s ‘On Demand’ Organ Bank Raises Concerns of Forced Harvesting” published in The Epoch Times on August 11, the National Review article considered the aforementioned woman's on-demand organ supply as new evidence of the forced organ harvesting in China. Torsten Trey, executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) said patients in the United States usually wait around 6.9 months for a matching heart. This means that finding four hearts for the same person would require over two years in the U.S.   But that was not the whole story. The Epoch Times article noted that half of the U.S. population, or over 156 million adults, have given donation consent. But in China, people in general are reluctant to donate organs due to cultural reasons, and the voluntary organ donation system hardly functions in China.   The easy access to four hearts for one patient in a short time indicates that the organs were provided through an “on demand system,” Trey explained. This is further supported by the double-lung transplants that were broadly reported by Chinese media. Ethan Gutmann, a China analyst in this field, said that the message from such media coverage in China is that, “We have the organs. It’s safe. Come on over. China is open for business.”  In his 2014 book, The Slaughter, Gutmann documented testimonies from top-ranking police officials and Chinese doctors who had confirmed or participated in the organ harvesting crimes. During an interview with DAFOH, he said that many people have asked why the CCP would commit such atrocities. To answer that question, Gutmann conducted extensive analysis and documented his findings in the book.   “There is nothing stupid about such questions; in fact they are the central dilemma that my book investigates. Six of my ten chapters are devoted to how and why the repression of Falun Gong spun out of control,” he said in the interview.   Similarly, Smith also believes that ethics plays a crucial role. “The leaders of a despotism that eschews the sanctity of life, engages in forced labor/slavery to run its industrial manufacturing sector, and crushes religious minorities, aren’t going to worry about (to them) petty limitations such as morality and basic human decency,” He wrote in the National Review article.  “That’s on them. What’s on us is that we allow them to get away with it,” he concluded.
That is a grown baby! My brother was two weeks late and he was pretty big, too. But she is so alert and seems older already. So beautiful. Glad she and Lena are doing good!!! Congrats ❤️❤️❤️

it been so long sense ive seen them and i didnt know she was prego
Parker is such a cute name omg
cutest newborn :’) her eyes are so big
So we just gonna forget about..? I guess we are.
I had that balloon with no epidural or anything and it was so ungodly painful it traumatized me it was almost 7 years ago and I remember the pain like it was yesterday. The doctor wasn't gentle with checking my cervix and the nurses made me feel like a pussy but fuck it was horrible. I did get the epidural once they decided to give a c-section but I was in so much pain I can't even remember the second half of my birth experience.
This whole video you can see how Adam is falling in love with Lena the whole time and how much he wants to protect and nurture his girls, so cute. Y’all are going to be the best parents.
Had such a similar labor experience but ended up without a c section 😭 felt your pain momma but that baby girl makes it all worth it ❤️

Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He is and that is God in human form and you're given the free Gift of eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us. .

It took me longer to heal after giving naturall birth than it took my friend who had a c section. No matter which way you give birth everyone heals differently. But congrats on the new family member. May you heal quickly. Also i raised my little sister as my own (i had legal custody of her) im 30 atm and she is 24. I still worry about her just the same as i do my biological kids my daughter is 12 my son is 10.
she’s so cuteeee big eyes😍😍😍😍
i’m watching this video in surprise . i just had my baby boy, september 26th. he’s two months today. i had to have a c section too bc i wouldn’t open up down there. they tried putting me on things to open up, i was induced for 3 days and it wasn’t working. i was there fir three days before even having birth and i was so tired and in so much pain eventually the third day i couldn’t take the medicine anymore that was helping me open up i wouldn’t go passed 8cm. and i was screaming!! and crying!!! and in so much pain never felt that pain before. i got the shot in my back, it helped for an hour and it went away and i had to get stronger medicine to go in my back. i said i can’t take it anymore i need to get a c section. so we do. i slept through my whole surgery. and two whole hours after. i didn’t even see it get to hold my baby until the next day. i couldn’t even stand until 3 days after, still then it was so painful, i couldn’t walk to pee on my own for 3 days it took me 10 minutes to walk to the bathroom. i couldn’t sit on the bed it hurt. i couldn’t get out of bed it hurt. i couldn’t shower by myself. i’m so jealous you are already walking!!! and standing!!
I cried so hard
I was a last minute c-section too the drugs made my mom pass out and my dad had to take care of me reminds me of your guys story congrats 💞💞
Congratulations what a beautiful little pumpkin.  You both are very blessed with this child.

*Hopefully Adam22 becomes more genuine now* 😳
Congratulations! She’s perfect.
One of the Most Hideous Human Rights Disasters of the 21st Century The COHRC conducted a systematic study of the Chinese Organ Transplantation and Citizen Donation System and issued the 2019 new report during the Second US Ministerial Summit on Religious Freedom in Washington, DC in July this year.  Based on the nature, scale and severity of China's forced live organ harvesting, the COHRC revealed how China's organ transplant industry quickly expanded alongside the CCP's persecution of Falun Gong. The persecution meets all elements of genocide and crimes against humanity as set out by international law.  The research shows that the CCP used prisoners on a small-scale in the 1970s. Since 2001, organ transplants have been listed as a national development strategy, but with no national organ donation system in place. Also, the number of executions has been declining year by year.  China invested heavily in the research, personnel training and industrialization of organ transplantation, which has led to the exponential development of the Chinese organ transplant industry. In just a few years it has become the country with the largest number of organ transplants performed in the world.  By 2007, more than 1,000 military and local hospitals in China were involved in organ transplants. According to the Ministry of Health's minimum bed qualification requirements for transplant hospitals, the minimum annual capacity of only 165 approved hospitals is 70,000 transplants, far exceeding the government's declared 10,000 annual transplants.  Under pressure from the international community, the CCP announced that it completely banned the use of death row prisoners for organ transplant in 2015 and turned to voluntary donations from citizens. However, the COHRC study shows that by the end of 2017, China’s 373,000 registered organ donors can produce 12 actual donations based on the proportion of U.S. registered organ donors and actual donations. The sum of published donors (mainly from intensive care units in hospitals) from each province does not even meet the number of official transplants which were greatly understated.  However, China's organ transplant tourism, international academic and commercial cooperation extend through the organ sharing agreement to other parts of Asia and beyond via the so-called “Belt and Road”. This makes forced organ transplants a global crime.  The latest COHRC report reveals that behind this huge profiteering industry is an extra-judicial killing system driven by the Chinese Communist regime and involving the military and local institutions. The victims are mainly Falun Gong practitioners, as well as Uighurs, Tibetans, underground church members, dissidents and other vulnerable groups.  The report pointed out, “Falun Gong is neither the first nor the last group to be persecuted by the Chinese communist regime, but it is the only group that has been openly targeted for eradication.  “Ample evidence has been accumulated to allow for a detailed study with respect to the development, methods, and outcomes of the persecution. The scale, sophistication, cruelty and longevity of the campaign against Falun Gong make it one of the most hideous human rights disasters of the 21st century.”  The US Congress and the European Parliament have passed resolutions condemning the CCP for the forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. Israel, Spain, Italy, Taiwan, Norway and Belgium have also enacted legislation prohibiting citizens from organ transplant tourism to China.  In June 2019, the China Tribunal in London announced its final verdict: “Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one – and probably the main – source of organ supply.”  Working Together to Stop the Atrocities Several experts and scholars from various fields were shocked to learn the details of the 20-year genocide in China. They left their contact information to obtain more information. Some said they would incorporate the information into their curriculum, or participate in research and study. Others said they would encourage government legislators to stop the killing.  A man who is the vice president of an international medical and service non-profit organization, and the director and chief investigator of a US National Training Center, went to the COHRC booth and said that he had read the information the night before. He said that he informed all the people he knew about the issue. He solemnly said, “We will soon let all the people in the United States know.”  Professor Bibeau of the Department of Public Health at the University of North Carolina is preparing to offer a course in ethics. He thanked COHRC for providing detailed materials, “These research results are very timely and exactly what I need. This will become an important part of the course.”  A doctor from Chicago came to the COHRC booth and thanked the staff. She received the COHRC information folder the day before, and read the summaries of the 2019 new report and the 2018 report that evening.  She said that she wanted to send the information to her sister who is an organ transplant doctor in New York. They had heard of the forced live organ harvesting before but they had difficulty believing it. She said she had great respect for Falun Gong practitioners.

I’m so very proud of you! Csection is no joke!! I’m crying 😭 what a beautiful experience thank you for bringing us along 😻🙏🏻
I had a csection with my daughter she was breech! Best advice I can give you is get up and move around as much as you can ❤️❤️❤️I’m pregnant again right now and most likely will have another csection. My plan was to have an at home birth as well. God has a plan 💞
Wow she has the biggest, most beautiful eyes! Congratulations 😇
Congrats addam
This literally could’ve been avoided ... sorry you had to get a csection
Lena is just the best still laughing and positive while IN ACTUAL LABOR
Omg, her noises, I can't take it, you guys are gonna be such amazing parents tho, I love watching how in love you all are with her, Adam is so sweet with her, Im 41 and due to health issues it just wasn't something I couldn't do.  The older I get the more it's killing me as I absolutely love kids and wanted them so very bad, I do want to foster or something to help the kids who don't have the parents they deserve or for whatever other reason.

We are talking of a revolution not physical but psychological revolution where there is no, at the depth, conformity. Conformity exists when there is comparison but a mind to be totally free of comparison that is to observe the whole history which is embedded in you.
What a beautiful newborn!
I waited to watch this over coffee, and I couldn’t b happier I did this. I am SO OVER THE MOON for you guys, it’s inappropriate...you cooked a good lookin baby, Lena, ALL the congratulations to you both. 💌🧚🏻‍♀️🌊

I never got itchy from the epidural but I’ve heard of that. Also I worked for an OB office and never heard of any woman being two weeks overdue. Most just go one week or a week and two days. I feel for you because I was over by five days and thought I’d burst. Congrats 🎉

Yet I have indeed bestowed upon this generation a multitude of gifts, a great number of words, words of warning and unsurpassed wisdom, words of exaltation and correction, calling all in the earth to repent.

Behold, I have proclaimed the way of salvation, time and time again, and He whose name is The Salvation of God!  Yes, I have blown the trumpet and called forth My watchmen, I have struck the gates and rattled the doors, I have shaken the foundations of the earth! And still the people hold fast, clutching the pillars and shoring up the doors against Me! Yet from the beginning I established the line, a narrow way which I had placed in the midst of My people, Israel. And in My mercy, I revealed The Way in which My people should walk. Behold, even now I have placed a plumb line in the midst of all people, setting all these crooked paths straight. For I am The Lord, and I do not change.  Or do you still think that I have come forth to  Bring peace on earth? No, not peace, but great division!...  Behold, I have come forth to correct and discipline, to rebuke  And pass judgment, to make war and divide the spoils!...  FOR MY WORD IS FIRE!...

Congratulations!🎉 She’s so sweet & beautiful!❤️
You wanna know something insanely selfish?? That you guys were unmasked around these poor nurses and healthcare workers after knowing you’ve been wildly irresponsible during the pandemic and hanging out with multiple people all the time and shooting content and shit.
She has Lena's eyes, 😍, awwwwww!  Love her 🥰

Adam23
y’all are goals love y’all! congratulations fam
What a perfect baby!
I’m not crying foo, you’re crying.  But on a serious note - I’m so happy for you guys. Holding my sweet daughter for the first time, 5 years ago... felt soOoOOO surreal.  You carry her for9 months but when you see her come out of your body — it feels like a dream. Nothing beats that. You’re going to be an incredible mom and dad.  My dad told me, “welcome to the human race” right after my daughter was born, so I’m here telling you as well. Welcome to the beginning of the rest of your life.  * p.s. if you find yourself struggling with nursing your baby through these especially difficult early months - reach out to your local La Leche League group and they will be a wonderful source of information and encouragement for this time.  I wish your child nothing but health and happiness for her whole life. You’re very blessed ☺️🌻🌼🌙🌸🌺🌷💐🌹🌈☀️🌟✨⚡️⭐️.  * p.s. drink a shit ton of water every day for milk production, and ask your midwife/doctor about Fenugreek to increase milk production as well. Have Adam bring you a giant glass of water every single time you sit down to nurse her 🙂 CONGRATULATIONS, and welcome to Earth, sweet child🥰 I hope my lil unsolicited advice wasn’t taken as anything other than my pure love ❤️
That kid is going to get bullied so hard in school 🤣💀
omg u can hear baby breathing when lena is explaining her tum!!
I'm so happy for you guys, I think you are both going to be amazing parents ❤️ Lena you have always had this Muma Bear nature about you and seeing you look at your baby girl makes me so excited to have my own one day 🥰 seeing you hold her, I feel like it's weird to think of yous without her! Motherhood suits you ❤️ Wishing your beautiful family a merry Christmas and the most wonderful, happy, healthy and safe new year ! Xoxo
This is so amazing!!! She’s gorgeous, congrats
Congratulations! She's adorable!
Smiling and eyes open from birth, that is crazy! When my daughter was born last year we had to wait a few days for her to open her eyes and then she didn't start smiling for a couple months. Lucky guys!
Congrats! It's the best feeling in the world
Guys she is beautiful!! 🖤🖤🖤
You guys are gonna be awesome parents. Congratulations.
Ahhh she's lovely! Congratulations what a beautiful family!
Clickbaiting using a new life.....new levels of low innaugrated here.....disgusting

She’s so cute
She is GORGEOUS!!!!! Congratulations 🥰💕💕💕💕
Congrats on baby girl! Welcome to parenthood!  Nothing will ever be the same. 🙃🥰
Congratulations! She’s such a cutie 🥺
She’s so beautiful congratulations guys❤️
Same thing happened to me. Itchiness and emergency c section. My baby was not fine
she’s so precious
You guys are naturals! 🥺💕
this was such a raw and beautiful video. happy for the both of u ❤️
She’s so beautiful 🥺❤️ congrats!!
She’s gorgeous 😍😍
OH MY GOD! This happened to me! They did five seaweed sticks, three full bags of pitocin... and after three and a half days they did a balloon catheter! My longest contraction was 9 minutes long and my baby was face up and stressed. We talked about doing a c section but I wanted to push, AND SHE CAME! They broke my water and I was able to push her out. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS! I felt to self conscious about having to be induced after her being ten days over her projected birth date. I've never heard of anyone else going through what you have. All the YouTube videos I've heard of women saying it was "so tough" and then hearing the easiest labor story! Glad to know I'm not alone. I also had an epidural at the last second after they pulled the balloon out. I should have done it long before but I wanted the natural birth until the end lol
Sea Food lovers , this Asian recipes for you !!!!! https://youtu.be/GoFeNmuT_7w 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
So cute so beautiful I can see great parents 🥺🥺🥺
So I heard there’s two types of an epidural: one that’s fast acting and you itch a ton and the other where it takes a bit to kick in and it has no itching. Maybe that’s why you experienced so much itching?  Anyway, congratulations!! Wish you three the best 💕💕🥰
Lena!!!! Hold the back of her head! Omg I was having major anxiety watching that
Did that nurse seriously just ask Lena “do you like her?” What in the actual fuck😂 obviously I LOVE my own daughter that just got ripped outs me😭😂😂😂
Shes sooooo cute! And so big!!!!!
I am so so sooo happy for you two! Welcome to the mommy life Lena! ILY💗😘
aww she looks just like adam she do cute about time you was pregnant forever girl lol congrats
This made my day. You two becoming parents is iconic.
Congratulations guys I’m so happy for you guys and you guys made a beautiful baby
I’m literally crying so hard right now
Even if you don’t have a c section you still have to take care of your self cause you’re bleeding for weeks and may have stitches down there and you will have a hard time peeing and just a bunch of stuff.
Congrats to you all, she is gorgeous.  She looks like her daddy...
Adams Twin!! Congrats guys 👶 🍼 🎈🎊
I'm literally crying at how sweet that baby is
Aye adam you prolly wont see this but congrats man!👍
Congratulations she is perfect 😍
Congratulations to you both! She’s Adams twin!! The baby is adorable
She’s beautiful!!! Congratulations guys I’m so happy for you y’all. I’m happy you had a safe delivery and I pray she stays a healthy happy baby and I wish you three love and happiness. Such a beautiful family 🥺❤️
Every other vlogger who has a baby “it’s taking a while for me to dilate, they put in a catheter, I’m so happy I got the epidural” Lena & Adam - “she has a balloon in her vagina, it’s pretty tight in there, on mad drugs - itchin, you know how like in lyrics they say percs have you itch” 😂 I love it
The second baby was shown I started crying
“Do you like her “ wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣
She is absolute perfection😍 congratulations guys❤
But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. 1 Timothy 6:9 KJV
Your daughter is so beautiful💕 I'm so happy for you guys! When I had my daughter it made my life complete and I know you guys feel the same fersure 💕 much love to your family🥳🥳💕💕
Her eyes are wide open lol some beautiful eyes 💗 congratulations
Congratulations man! You guys are gonna be amazing parents!
Yay congrats! My sons heart rate dropped super quick and I got raced into a room like nascar pit crew quick, they had to completely knock me out, cause my epidural didnt numb me enough. And I was completely looped outta my mind for 36 hours and barely remember the first time I held my son..and they didnt let my boyfriend in the OR! My mom gets super itchy when she takes any pain meds, when I took them(not how I was suppose too, I'm clean now) and my legs use to itch really bad!
Congrats man !
Welcome to the club cuh!!!
Awww I cried at the way Lena was staring at her when she first came out 😭congrats!

Congratulations to you both! You have a beautiful little angel 💗 I can already tell that Adam is a proud daddy and will be very protective of his little girl. She's gonna be a daddy's girl for sure.

The same thing happened to me girl! I was induced and my baby’s heart rate kept dipping with my contractions and I was relieved when I was told I had to have a c section lmao, I was excited cause I didn’t have to do much work. And the recovery isn’t bad at all, not for me at least! My baby is a month old now ☺️
Her push present! 👌🏼 nice choice Adam. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Congratulations to both of you. She’s absolutely perfect ❤️
“Do you like her?”   Like ma’am wtf she gonna say, hell no??
Please be sure to always support the baby’s head. Congratulations!
So glad both of you are healthy! She is absolutely beautiful. You are going to be such a great mom 💕

The nurse “do you like her?” Why would you even ask someone that 😂
It’s a known thing that newborns are just not cute but their baby is BEAUTIFUL! Wow
Did they really say “do you like her”?!?!
I cried ❤️ so beautiful.
I love how much love they have for each other. And how caring Adam is towards her. I love how much they grew in last 9 months and how far they came. Congrats!!!!
Pitocin is not a pain killer - and an epideral isn’t a pain killer. She was just having a weird reaction
11/20/20 just had a baby as well planned c section though
Congrats guys! Let your kid know he made 2020 worth the wait!
Cutest little baby in the world 🥺💖 I’m so happy for y’all and everything the future has in store for you too & y’all’s little family! Super proud!! ✨

That nurse was.. something else. Congrats! I hope you heal well
Omg that itch is fucking insane ! Especially after a c section and you can’t move, I was begging my nurses to scratch the back of my legs for me. I was on Benadryl around the clock 😭

She's so cute!! congrats to you both!! <3
Proud of you
same thing happened to me 2 weeks ago when i had my baby they induced me, was in labor for 14 hours while my baby’s heartbeat kept going up and down until finally they said it was gonna be a c-section to not risk the baby’s health😰definitely a longer recovery
This is amazing. Thank you for sharing ❤️

Congratulations to you both so happy for you guys she's beautiful ☺
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
Omg this is so adorable yall are gonna be great parents #daddy22
12:53 "And all I can think about is how am I ever going to stop worrying you? I don't think I will, ever." 😭💔
Wowwwww omgggggg congratssssssss 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 i can’t wait to have a baby some day too!! Love you guys sm !! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
lol "do you like her?"
She’s so precious!
I was in labor for 37 hours before I had to have my c-section. I was sooooo shaky when they switched my epidural meds from the normal meds to the strong version. I got itchy after they removed my epidural.  Glad both you and her are safe!!!
I didn’t get itchy, I just felt great!
Lol I haven’t watched yet but cracked up at “shocking c section.” Girl you were like 43 weeks pregnant. I could’ve predicted this 😂😂😂 idk about shocking. But congrats y’all!!!!!! So happy you have a healthy new baby and mom ❤️❤️

This is so beautiful thanks for sharing 🥺
I had a c-section 3x I feel your pain! You go Lena 💗🤍 I’m so happy for you x Adam. Congratulations Mommy & Daddy 👶🏽 🍼💗🙌🏼
The epidural didn't make me itchy with my first...makes me nervous for the next time I give birth in 9 weeks! You're a boss, momma! I'm so happy for your family. She is BEAUTIFUL! ❤
Lena the fucken queen ✨
"gonna be a big thing for armenia" lmaooooo brb crying alot
I can’t imagine like In 15 to 20 years that their daughter will soon find out what Lena and Adam do for a living besides the podcast and YouTube , ya’ll know what I’m talking about !
Congrats!!!
I just ugly cried and I don't even regularly follow you two. Your baby is precious and beautiful. What a scary ordeal, I'm sorry you had to go through all that. Women who go through this should be given badges of bravery or something. I wonder why it happened this way, that with all the measures to bring on labor your body just wasn't ready. Women are too often rushed through to a surgical procedure, birth is handled too medically in the U.S.. I wonder why you didn't have a doula and a midwife either, because women in labor need womens' support all around them that is NOT just medical personnel. God bless you all.
Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️ it makes me so happy to see a couple that was prepared for their baby like you were!
congrats to you both!!!
Ong the white noise video on 9n thw background😂 i play that  every night for my son whos now 4 weeks. I pause it when I feed and play it again when I lay him back down so I can gage how much sleep I get lol
“Are you recordin-“
Now we wait 9 years until he sees his mama on the hub lul..
Congrats📷https://youtu.be/41baMYcCR0w
For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.  I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.  Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.   Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information) He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope.  To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen.......
Beautiful baby ! Congrats y’all !
Adams so inlove with the baby i love that
Did the nurse just ask “do you like her?” Hahahaha what is she going to say?? No let me return her and get another one?
Lena, we have almost the exact experience during the c section, I felt so much guilt later on about being out asleep during my c section but thankfully we both have amazing men in our life who could step up during our sleepy time. Now I’m going to go hug my baby, congrats to you both. Parker you are oh so blessed 💖
She is soooooo beautiful! Just like her mommy and daddy. I wish yalll nothing but blessing on this new chapter in our lives.
Awe my baby has the loose skin and pointy ears and 8 weeks later he’s already full or fat rolls and his ears are rounding out

Another culture vulture born

*Lena shes your twin !*
How cute she’s so alert
When they were opening the painting did I hear “Parker” as the baby name? 🥺 that’s so cute
WHO TF CARES.
Congratulations y'all 🎊🎉
I would be so afraid to have a baby during CoVid
Congratulations ❤🤰
Yall are going to be such amazing parents.  The way you both look at her... just... you know there is SO MUCH love for her already.
Congrats!!!
Have they told us her name yet?? 😭😭 I want to know her name so bad!
So we're all gonna ignore the fact that Adam is wearing his mask backwards?
I honestly never seen so much love between a mom and a baby.... she is so adorable. Yall made a cute ass baby♡♡♡
Congratulations 😁😁😁
So happy for you three! She's beautiful. Mad love from Chicago
I'm a man but this is so cute 😍
Congrats 🎉. She is beautiful!
OMG she's BEAUTIFUL 🥰
🥺🥺🥺
Congratulations you guys, she’s beautiful 💜
Yayyyy! I'm so glad shes here now!  I'm currently 37 weeks pregnant myself & if I wasn't already anxious/excited enough to meet my little girl, I definitely am now. 😍💞
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3    PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
Congratulations !!!! Welcome to parenthood !!!
Lol to this kid when he finds out his moms belongs to the skreets
Her eyes are huge!! Mine were wrapped around my head too when I was born 😂😂 congratulations fr tho!
The itching and the shakes, then the almost convulsing after my c-section from my teeth chattering, when I wasn’t cold (or I couldn’t feel that I was), is the WORST.
i have never found a newborn baby cute but this is the cutest baby i've ever seen
Let me find out y'all gonna put the pregnancy video on OnlyFans ik Adam would want that guap 🤣
Congrats guys she’s beautiful 💕🤍💕🤍
okay but the way she has lena’s whole face 🥺🥺
Congratulations
The youtube white noise has been my friend for the past YEar lol!!! Seeing that on the screen made me giggle its magic
She is beautiful ❤️❤️ Congratulations!!
there are certain things that shouldn’t be on youtube
So precious 😭
This kid going to be 1iq and super dumb
Congratulations on y'alls Beautiful baby girl!!! I was 15 weeks pregnant on 11/11/20. I went into early labor. We only got to hold her for a little over an hour before she passed😭.But I love yall as a couple, and I'm so happy for y'all!!
idk why i thought she'd be tatted
Rope gang literally
love adam calling out the trolls on twitter yessssss I love you both CONGRATS "oh youre naked I didn't even notice" LMAO
she is so beautiful!! congrats adam & lena!
the hospital staff really just asked a mother if she likes her newborn..huh?
He exposed his license plate 😂
I'm so happy for you,  congratulations. She is beautiful,  your great parents already
Your baby is so big !
12:16 technically, adam’s sack was her first home 😂😂😂😂
The baby has Lena’s nose and Adams eyebrows
Tony the cat”: “I knew something was wrong I knew it I’m getting replaced”
damn thats a big ass baby. no wonder she was stuck in there overdue! 😂
She is beautiful 😍
I cannot cope with how cute and relaxed that baby girl is wow
Did somebody actually say “Do you like her” 🤣
Nope you never stop worrying. The newborn and baby stages are fun and easy, once they hit puberty or have more needs then just food and a diaper it gets hard. Emotional stuff is always the hardest and you’ll always wonder if you did or said the right thing. But trust your instincts mama!
congrats you two! you are so blessed with such a beautiful little girl. can already tell you will be bomb parents :)
🥺
Nothing happens then boom cut to clip of baby who looks just like Lena! Crazy!  Edit nope she looks like Adam! Crazy how babies faces do that! She’s gorgeous congratulations!
I remember when you two first met, and now a baby 😍 so beyond happy for you two!! Congratulations 🥰
is no one going to comment on how shes literally a mini adam?!?!?! she looks just like him!!! im crying its so cute!!!
Awe that's exactly what happen I went over two weeks with my baby tried to be induced & couldn't go pass 3 had to have emergency csection it sucks but I'm so glad y'all had her safe & both are healthy she's adorable blessings

what’s her name?
Omg.  She is so alert for a newborn.  She's so beautiful 😍 Congratulations to you both 💓
Shes absolutely perfect!!! 💜💜💜💜
She looks like a doll🥺💗
Oh my Gawd she is so beautiful! And so alert!
And congratulations to you and Adam both you guys are going to be awesome parents and she's absolutely perfect
She is absolutely beautiful!! Congratulations! 🎈🍾🎊  A csection was traumatic for me. 😣 but so worth it. I wish you both a wonderful life with your babe! ❤️
Your experience is almost identical to my first birth getting to have a scheduled C-section with my second kid was really nice it was actually calming to schedule it almost like a surgery have it be something that was so easy and for me to know exactly what was going to be happening and going on
Awww look at baby Parker Ann! Congrats Lena and Adam!!!
WOW YOU DID SO GOOD (ALL 3 PF YOU)❣ Cant wait to see you all grow and thanks for letting us see and be a part of it 🌹
Oh boy. I feel you on not wanting a c section, itching with the epidural. With my firstborn, they induced me on 8/12 and he was born via section 8/16. It was brutal. If y’all decide to have a second baby, ask for antihistamine with the epidural, if you do one. Vbac is hard to do after a section, but not unheard of. Glad you, baby are safe. Also, I had a spinal with my second son. And holy frak. I wish people would’ve told me things I didn’t know. No one prepared me for the struggles of caring for a baby after a section.  You guys made a beautiful baby! Congratulations! Edit: I have a 22 year old, a 20 year old and an 18 year old. You never stop worrying about your kids. No matter their ages.
Congratulations to the both of you! 💕
I love these 2 so much❤️♥️❤️♥️Congrats
Shoutout Adam and Lena man
Congrats guys 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Why is this being vlogged?
Shes an angel!!!!! I am so beyond happy for you guys! You both are going to be amazing fucking parents to that beautiful little baby girl

I think it’s affects everyone different. I wasn’t itchy like that when I was in high school I took pain killers before so I know what you’re talking about,  but when I had my baby i don’t remember the epidural making me itchy I was just numb i couldn’t feel my back or legs lol . Even if I did itch I would feel it 😂

So it’s true! The first born daughter looks like dad haha although of course as she gets older and now you can see a mix of Lena 😌😌
Bruh wtf why doesn’t the baby have a mask on?? CORONA!!
Congrats Adam 💯
She’s got adams nose and lenas mouth and eyes 😭❤️
She is soo cute!!! You seem to be doing really well with your csection wound. Unless you’re hiding your true pain.   The nurses question of “do you like her?” was very interesting too! 🤦🏻‍♀️
congratulations
I am so so happy for you guys!! Seeing you both in parent-mode makes my heart so happy, y’all were meant to be together & create this beautiful little life. Welcome earth-side Parker 💓💞 (so happy you used the name i was hoping y’all would 😆) She is perfection!!!! Congrats 22 Fam

congratulations on healthy baby!♥️ i’m 38 weeks right now trying to come to terms with the fact that a birth plan is basically irrelevant 🥴
I criiiiied. Congratulations to you guys! ♡
She is the cutest newborn I’ve ever seen🥺
Hey, c sections save lives! Home births are great, but they're not the best. A c section saved my life when I was born and my son's when he was born. We need to normalize c sections and not feel shameful about them ❤
I’m sorry but babies are usually ugly and you have to lie and say omg your baby is so cute but Lena and Adam your baby came out the cutest I have ever seen omfg. The pics on insta too have me dying.
Congratulations❤
Congrats!!!
Love love love love !!! Congratulations 💜💜💜💜
Yay! I’ve been waiting for this for SO LONG!!!
seeing Adam with her makes my heart melt. such a tough guy turning into such a softy always gets me 🥺
Congrats 🎉 she’s beautiful!!!

Epidural did not work for me and my drs told me pretty much that there will be pain on an epidural, I cried and cried for 16 hours bc it hurt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way Lena keeps looking at Parker just🥺😭😭 having a newborn is so fuckin beautiful. Shes a lil cutie pie!
Even though the baby was still puffy from you know.. being born.. I could tell right away she has Lena’s eye shape and a lot of Adam’s features. She’s beautiful, congratulations 💕
Omg congratulations to you both. She's so beautiful and precious. Watching you guys with her is such a beautiful thing. You both will be amazing parents.

She is absolute perfection💕 Adam’s whole vibe changed when he saw that beautiful baby🥰😭 so happy for your little family!
she has her daddy’s lil nose. y’all are gonna be amazing parents 🥺 there’s just so much love between y’all 💓
Welcome to the world 🌎
You must have had a allergic reaction to the epedural, I had 4 and was never itchy with any of them. Baby is so cute. Congratulations
She is so precious 🥺❤️ congratulations to both of you💕💕
As soon as I saw her I noticed how her eyes are so big and beautiful🥺
Also i know how bad c sections can suck! I love you so much for your honesty and how open you've been through your experience!
Congratulations y’all! Lena is such a champ, considering everything she went through. She literally became a mom solely based off that first look she gave the kid ❤️
What A Beauty! You guys are doing great! And how in the fuck are you walking lol
She is beautiful! Im so happy for you guys i could cry. Looking forward to seeing the sweet girl grow in your videos to come! 💜💜💜
Support her neck woman!!!
She’s so alert, and she’s the cutest! Congratulations guys💕
Congratulations I’m glad I was here before the baby I remember the first blog I watched was wit Adam I seen a cool white dude riding a BMX clicked the video seen his lifestyle and the click bate videos with Lena had me locked in for least 5years or more Be safe #RipKingNip #RipKingVon
Did Adam say her name is Parker??? If so I love it. I'm so proud of you guys. What a beautiful family!!! Congratulations!!
omg congratulations
She’s so so so beautiful. Congratulations guys 😌
😍😍 beautiful! Stop scratching tho! Its what gave me stretch marks 😪😪😪 it itches so fucking bad the day we went to have our c-section and the week after
So cute ❤️
So happy for y’all this is amazing
Can u believe a human was inside you? To this day its so crazy to me and I have a 13 yr old lol
PLEASE GET MARRIED
i could cry she is so sweet
Lena, I am so grateful for this video! I feel you when you want something so bad, but sometimes it doesn’t work out that way! I wanted to go all natural but my son said nope! And I had to do an emergency C section. It’s heartbreaking. Thank you so much for sharing your experience because I’m constantly wishing I had a natural birth, especially seeing everyone else do it with no complications! I wanted that first skin to skin with my baby but he came out very sick and had to be transported to another hospital and I wasn’t able to hold him until a week after he was born. Thankfully I still successfully breastfed and he is very healthy now! I love you so much!! I’m so happy for you and Adam and I genuinely look forward to all your videos! You’re an amazing woman !
Why am I crying watching this at 4 am
This made me hella emotional 😭
Cried watching this, I'm so happy for you guys! Luckily everything went well! <3
Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 the baby is amazing I’m so happy for you guys. God bless
🥰😍😭 that beautiful wee face omg ❤ those eyes are absolutely gorgeous. love you guys 😘
'how am I ever gonna stop worrying about you, I don't think I will'  I know... And just like that everything changes and you never do stop worrying....  Makings of a great mother 🥰
Awwweee papa Adam , being a dad has come to natural to you! Same with Lena, the way she looked at her made my entire heart melt ❤😍 motherhood/fatherhood is by far the greatest gift ! Congrats guys, dont blink.. She will be grown before you know it.. They grow so fast!
Congrats guys she’s precious
I’ve never had baby fever so strong as I do after watching this🥰🥰🥰!! Thanks so much for sharing, hope you have a quick recovery!!
Always knew lena was meant to be a mom💖
I'm so sick of the comment and idea that all that matters is baby is healthy. The health and mental well-being of the mom is absolutely just as important. If Mom isn't healthy, mentally included, then she can't properly care for her baby. Mom's matter too y'all.
Not me having baby fever after watching this 😭🥺🥰
“Feel asleep during the c section OH MY GOD LENA LITERALLY HAS HAD THE EASIEST PREGNACY I HOPE YO GOD ITS THE SAME FOR ME :(
She’s so alert and precious ❤️😩 welcome to the world baby Parker!
the baby is so beautiful 😍😍😍😍 she looks just like Lena
My oldest is 19. I worry more about him bc he’s away at college a d not under my roof anymore. You’re absolutely correct, you never stop worrying!
Congrats shes a cutie and shes so alert
Wow An actual cute newborn
The epidural is so gross! It does make you itchy and just blah... So glad you made it through and your sweet baby is beautiful! Congrats ✌️💖
Awww Tony is a big brother 😻. Congratulations guys 💐🥳.
I could feel how much you love her through the screen 🥲
Right before you got pregnant I was saying how great of a mom you’d be one day. I’m so happy she’s finally here ❤️ Congrats Lena & Adam 😇
She is literally so cute more cute than I could’ve ever imagined 🥺🥺🥺🥺💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
what a beautiful video, you’re gonna be such great parents there’s so much love already 😍🥰
Hey little girl, welcome to this world!
I’m literally crying
Maybe ur allergic to the shot
So my mom and I have been following Lena and Adam’s journey through this from the start. I wanted to cry because of how loving they already are and how perfect she is. My mom was so giddy to see Lena recovering well after her C and to see Adam “look softer”. Congratulations on your perfect baby girl and we will be looking forward to more Parker progress 💖
she's so alert right from the beginning! being parents seems to come so naturally for you guys
15:05 Baby looks like she is thinking:  Listen folks when i told GOD i wanted you both as my parents it was on the premise ya'll were NOT gonna be the __cringey-chessey-loveydovey-overbearing type......like what the what ?!?!?__ 😁LoL
Congratulations guys! Best feeling in the world she’s beautiful
congratulations!
She’s so perfect
Congratulations guys
I have 4 kids, I had my first one at 16. What beautiful experience! 🥰
That was beautiful best part though was when she was 1st feeding her and he blocked the titti with whole milk lol  You guys are gonna have so much fun with that little girl congratulations
girl i had a c-section due to the cord wrapped around my daughters neck. and had NO help, you got this. it’s not as bad as it seems. ❤️  you are so strong!
Why did I cry seeing you with your new baby!!!! You are going to be an amazing mother and Adam is going to be an amazing father!!!! I wish you both all the happiness in life!
Wow she’s bigg
She is so precious! Such a cutie! Congrats <3
I'm in love, can't wait to see more of her
Congratulations to you both !! She’s so so beautiful , many blessings to your little family 😊❤️
I had to have a c section last minute as my baby was not coming and getting very upset inside of me, c section is not the easy was out as people call it, it’s very hard after for weeks, well done!
Orbs in 10:35 mark. Angels are there!!
Just watch tony all the time and maybe put him in another room when y'all sleep, cats don't realize how tiny babys are and sometime want to snuggle with them and can accidentally sit on baby.  not trying to scare you but just in care you we never aware.
It’s crazy seeing you guys with a baby! Congrats!
i dont like bebes but shes actually really cute
you went home 2 days after a c section, that is amazing you're doing so well.
Baby girl doesn’t know she was brought into the world with cool parents
The milk gallon lol over the baby
That’s like the cutest fresh baby I’ve ever seen
Congrats
Oh I cried when I saw her 🥺 I’m happy for y’all

this is so crazy to me because i’ve been watching your videos since you’ve been pregnant and I found out I was pregnant I little behind where you are and I went to the hospital this weekend for pain in my chest and I ended up having to do an emergency c section due to me having something called hellp syndrome. my baby was only 27 weeks so she has to stay in the ICU but watching this in the hospital right now has me so excited to be able to bring her home in february 🖤 congratulations lena 🖤🖤
Adam is the sweetest 🥺 so happy for you guys
She looks up at her daddy and mama with such love . OMG congrats!! ❤❤❤
Her complexion was perfect.. i think she cooked the right amount of time! Beautiful
Congrats!!!! I’m so happy for you and Adam! 🖤 You’ll be the coolest parents lol . My daughters birth went about the same as yours. They ended up putting me to sleep before the emergency C section too but I didn’t get to see her or hold her for hours because I was knocked out for hours. But I’m glad they put me to sleep because not tryin to see my intestines on a table 😂
Precious 💙 u did great Lena 🎀👶🏻
I’m so damn excited for y’all been waiting for the baby for sooooo long congratulations 🎊🍾

I’m so happy for you guys. can’t wait to watch this journey❤️❤️❤️
Wtf kind of question is that “do you like her”🤣? What
She’s your twin Lena!!
6:29 the doctor ask Lena do u like her😂😂 like what is Lena suppose to say no I don’t can u just take her or sum
This is everything. Im sooooooooo beyond happy for u guys. Congrats.
I genuinely wish everyone loved their child as much as you love yours 💛💛
Adam never made it wide enough so she got a c-section 😂😂😂
That shot messed her back up in the long run 💉
This video made me cry yo . Life is beautiful-LiLpeep
Beautiful baby, beautiful family! Congratulations 👏
When he gave her the push present, am I the ONLY one who thinks he called the baby "Parker"
Congratulations guys!! She is perfect! So beautiful! I had the same kind of birthing experience with my daughter, you did a lot better than I did Lena. I was completely out of it for the first three days and barely remember anything.
She’s too cute. I highly recommend the owlet for baby, it will give u so much peace of mind when you sleep. It measured oxygen saturation levels and heart rate. If anything goes wrong through the night it will notify you with a alarm right away. It also comes with a camera that you can mount on the wall.
Do you like her? Like wtf who don’t like there own baby .? 🤣🤣🤣
Oh my goodness she looks so much like mommy 😫😍xx
i have never seen such a beautiful new born
Congratulations you guys!!! She's soooo cute, you guys will be the best parents she could ask for!
No one tells you about the itchiness! A lot of what happens postpartum isn’t talked about. It’s a mess 😅   Regardless, congratulations! Sorry your birth plan didn’t work out, but the most important part is that mama and baby are safe and healthy.
Omg she is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen! 😍 Congratulations to you both! She’s is so precious 💕💕💕
It’s 4 in the morning and I had to wait til my boyfriend went to work to watch this because I knew I was gonna cry!

Why am I crying
She's so precious.  Congratulations you two on your beautiful blessing.    I was also very very emotional after both of my baby girls were born.  It was just like a surreal feeling that you can't explain.  I felt so much joy but tears of joy and the emotions were all over the place.  Being a parent is the best feeling in the world and the feeling you have towards your new baby is so indescribable.   Welcome to parenthood ❤️  The best but yet the most overwhelming thing in life.  Wouldn't trade it for the world.
Her eyes 😍
Awh she’s so beautiful 😭🥺😍congratulations guys . And good job Lena I know this isn’t how you wanted it but you did it ❣️❤️🧡

Damn bro, I been watching you for 4 or 5 years. I remember the old store interviews and vlogs being downtown on hella drugs. So fuckin dope to see how far y’all have come and how much your life has changed!
So beautiful. Congrats family.
I had to he induced my 1st pregnancy so I had an epidural and it was a slow process because I was only 2cm dilated also..and my water didn't break on it's own [either time] so the dr had to break it for me and it hurt so bad. My 2and delivery, I had sharp contractions out of nowhere and was rushed to the hospital, 10cm dilated.. too late for an epidural or any medication and had him natural 13 mins after arriving at the hospital. It was the worst pain I had EVER experienced almost making me pass out. I'm sure the entire floor heard me screaming bloody murder. I was only 7 hours away from my scheduled induction to AVOID pain as much as possible and control the situation. *The lesson I learned: no matter how much you think you can control something, anything is possible.*  Enough of me, congratulations to you both!!! She is beautiful!! Look at those eyes and how she looked at her daddy♡   If you ever want some cool lullabies,  there's a channel here on YouTube called Rockaby Baby... they turn a bunch of random songs into lullabies.[Nirvana, Metallica, Green Day, The Beatles etc]...my 3 month old likes to listen to those and Disney songs on the paino. Also, I looked up rain hitting the window, fans blowing, white noise, ocean waves and it really helps soothe babies! Check them out if you haven't already. Your lives are forever changed ♡♡♡♡♡♡ So happy for you guys.
“are you recordi-“ then cuts off 😭
Wow Parker is the most alert newborn I’ve ever seen. She’s going to be so smart. Congratulations 🍾🎈🎉 Adam and Lena 💕💕💕💕

I love you guys so much. Congratulations y'all! ♥️♥️♥️ She's beautiful 😍
I love her!! You have a beautiful angel on earth!! Love and Light Parker Ann!! 💝💝💝
It has been AMAZING to see your journey together as a couple. I remember when yall first got together and Adam was all talking about "not being locked down" and yall weren't like "officially" together. And now look at you two! I couldn't be happier for the two of you! Congrats! I KNOW you guys will be the bestest of parents. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
You will stop worry about her, just a little, like a year and half from now:) And switch off the light when she is falling asleep, babies like it, it reminds them the dark of their "first home":)
As someone who’s been watching Adam since the coke and Xanax warehouse party days I’m proud of your growth man 😂
The baby girl is so perfect awh love to see you both being great parents ❤️❤️❤️
Imagine the baby came out black
"do you like her?" nah, can I get a refund?  WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT? 😂

Your baby arriving healthy and u guys happy is the best thing that’s happened to me in 2020 <3

You deserve all the blessings that come your way. Congratulations Lena and Adam, you will be such wonderful parents. 💐😘
Congratulations  Lena & Adam she's perfect! 😇 She's so beautiful! Even when she isn't smiling her little face looks like she is.  She is precious. 👼🏻
this makes me want a kid one day
Congratulations to the both of you, you look fucking amazing with the child🤩🤩🤩 Adam if you see this ive been watching you since you did the schemaposse interview with jgreen ghost and peep and to see your sucsess is just amazing you deserve it. keep up the good work, love❤️❤️
Omg congrats she is absolutely beautiful 😍  I am so bummed you didn't get to experience natural birth like you wanted, it would of been so nice to see your reaction, its truly the best feeling in the world regardless im happy you and baby were both safe and healthy. also its crazy how epidurals have different effects on everyone i literally started shivering so bad as soon as I got it was horrible 😭  you're a warrior for going through that c-section❤❤
you guys are amazing parents already!! ❤️
She’s so cute congratulations
Been following Adam since before Lena was gf status and they just hung out together. Congratulations!! It's been a fun ride!!
Such big eyes 🥺 so precious
Girl why do you have to censor yourself feeding your baby?
Congratulations!! Thank you for sharing your story.
I am so so so so happy for you 🤗🥰God Bless you and your family and of course your beautiful angel 😇 those are such special moments ❤️🥰love you guys 🤗😍
Do you like her?like wtf .She should have said no can I trade her.
omg her big eyes are the cutest thing ever I cant
Congratulations yal!!!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 baby feels congratulations 💕💕💕
This is weird lol I used to watch Adam living in NY now he’s a dad 😐 makes me think of when am I going to be a dad too
Congrats, she's gorgeous! But one thing I found weird was the nurses question, "do you like her?" Like what the heck, what kind of question is that? Who asks a new mum and dad a stupid question like that? Like nah I don't like her, take her away and get me a different baby. Seriously...
Lena DO NOT SRATCHHH!!! girl I know it’s so hard but whenever you feel itchy just rub oils & Don’t stop using oils. Stretch marks can appear even AFTER the baby. Don’t get me wrong if you get them it’s still beautiful because you created life but not scratching will help prevent 💛
Awwwwww this makes me so emotional being a day 1 supporter of you guys. Y’all are gonna be the coolest parents!!! 💕
So adorable!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Awweeee 😭♥️ she’s such a cute lil thing 🥺 congratulations y’all ✨
soo beautiful congrats to both of you!!!
Y’all really are going to make the most beautiful children ever 🥺🥰
I can’t wait til my time comes 🥺❤️
That’s a cute baby
Congrats!!! She's precious!!
6:28 “dO yOu LiKe hEr??”  WTF KIND OF QUESTION Like is it ur first day on the job Kathy? TF “do you like the baby that just came outa ur vagina?”

Dadam22
Congratulations!!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳👶👶👶👼👼👼👨‍👩‍👦👨‍👩‍👦👨‍👩‍👦
Omg! She is absolutely beautiful! Congratulations!🤱🎉❤
Your so brave! We they told me i had to get a csection i cried 1 day straight
LOL what if Adam gave her a xan 😭😭
Babies trip me out man
Can we just take a minute and admire how amazing Lena looks for just having a c section. And shes absolutely beautiful, and Adam is already the best daddy! Congratulations Lena and Adam, shes perfect.
I can’t believe you’re standing that soon after a c-section lol! the strongest momma. you did an amazing job creating your little bean and I hope you take in every moment with her. she will grow drastically in a matter of weeks and months so take in every breath and every blink you have with her. it’s a blessing watching babies grow and you always look forward to the next stage and new things they learn. but remember that time cannot go in reverse so appreciate them needing you for now, because one day they won’t need you to do as much for them anymore.
6:23 the way Lena looks up is so precious
This make me so happy 🥺
“Do you like her?” 😂😂
Congrats Adam, glad Lena is ok
wishing your family all the best 💖
2 weeks past due means no longer a potato and super alert apparently omg congratulations!!!!

Sobbing when you started talking about the c section. I recently lost my baby 56 minutes after birth. Everything you said is so true. I’m so happy for you guys. My heart is so happy for you Lena and Adam.
I don’t want more kids. I don’t want more kids. I don’t want more kids. I don’t want more kids. I don’t want more kids. I don’t want more kids. Uggggh the baby love is so heart warming
Who baby is that?
Congrats Lena and Adam she beautiful

Oh my gosh she is so precious 😭😭😍😍💞 I am a nursery nurse and I see so many moms be disappointed when their birth plans don’t go as they thought but forget about all that once they see their baby there and healthy  😊😊
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🍾 💕
Bro careful with the head , always keep a hand under 👶👶👶👶
Crying watching this! My boyfriend and I love you guys both so much, we just had our 2nd daughter on the 7th via home birth and her name is Parker as well. I was like NO WAY it’s the same, I love that. Congratulations to you both! She is so incredibly beautiful!!
Amazing 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Lena I was in the exact same position as you!  Labored for FOREVER with my first baby and had to have a c sec and was so sad cause I wanted something else.  I had two VBACS after my c sec, so don’t worry you can still have that animalistic birth in the future.  :)

Baby Parker is so adorable 😍 💓 😭
Aweee congrats!! She’s so precious 🎉🥰😍 I can’t wait to have my babygirl in April 💕
Her name is Parker!!!!???? So cute!!
Lmao when they censored Lena's breasts...like really now you want to cover them when she's doing what their naturally used for...bruh
I hate that people think that a C-section is “an easy way out” I would have rather had my kids natural but had to have an emergency c-section with the first one and after they told me about the risks of having a natural birth after a c section I didn’t  want to take any chances. I had 5 even though they only want you to have 3 max I was healthy so they couldn’t tell me no.
Yo I cannot stop crying! Lena and my birth stories are so similar I mean it’s creepy from being two weeks overdue, baby stressed by Foley Cath, itchy as heck, force C-section, completely had to abandon all natura- at home-midwifery-childbirth, then the full on panic attack in which I fully thought that my heart was stopping I really did think I was going to die during the C! but at least I got to see the baby come out and then immediate panic, my husband shirtless all about the skin to skin, amazing dad while I was incapacitated, and just our whole 4 day  stay super he was a supe super helicopter daddy all shirtless and snuggles,we had a rule that nobody left the babies side no matter what no matter what they were doing no nursery no nothing and man he stuck to it and just really stepped up just like Adam. watching Lena and Adam so deeply in love with each other and the baby and Adam all giddy is literally everything I needed for the end of this year. I don’t know these guys, I don’t know these anything but what they let us all know about these people and  I obviously know they’re not gonna read this, but I gotta put into the universe how grateful I am to be reminded of such a great joy almost 8 years ago. 🥳 to L&A&P  🍼 👼🏼
Congratulations Lena and Adam she is gorgeous!
YES NEW BABY!!! TODAY OMG IVE BEEN WAITING!
❤ She's so cute and precious! Adam's such a great Dad, and Lena you are a warrior, can't even tell you had a c-section! Congrats! ❤
Most beautiful baby girl! Wow she’s stunning! Congrats guys!!!!!!!!!
Huge congrats I can’t even beleive how amazingly you are moving around 24 hours later I was in so much pain for 3 days
Omg you both are such great parents already she's one lucky beautiful little lady.. seeing you both gush over her made me cryyy

OOOOOOH MYYYY GOOOOD She's the cutest little thing Ive ever seen in my entire life. I dropped a tear when she was "skin to skin" for the first time with you Lena and you were looking at her like WOW you guys made this precious human. It made me think about how I am going to react myself if I ever have a baby. Crazy how life changing it is to become a parent. You start to see life differently and also you start to ask youself a lot of questions. It makes you wanna be a nicer person. Congratulations guys! I wish you all the best! Cant wait to see more pics and videos of her 😍❤️ not to mention what an amazing big brother Tony is going to be, you can already tell, always there to protect her🤍!
Beautiful family ❤❤❤

Congratulations you two! Lena, you are amazing and baby girl is beautiful! Rest, rest, and eat. Don't forget self-care since she will have all your attention. Bubble bath and some chocolate. :) Must take care of mental health when we're mama'ing. Thank you for sharing your birthing experience with us. It's such a private, intimate moment so I am grateful you shared it with us all. <3 peace, love, and baby Parker. <3
Ayyyy at least she’s still tight 😳👀  Yes it sucks for the scar and pain but both are healthy and happy so that’s all that matters ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ congratulations 🎊🎈🍾🎉❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
She’s beautiful
1st thing Adam did wrong when you guys arrived home... didn't allow your cat to greet the baby thats no good thats how animals become jealous also Lena didnt greet the cat. Congratulations ❤️ 👏 ❤️ 👏  xoxo
Omg congratulations she looks exactly like both of you sending good vibes🙌🏼
It broke my heart to read the title because I know how bad you didn’t want that, but I’m so happy for you and proud of you
So i see a lot of comments asking about why someone said "do you like her". Coming from a medical perspective there can be instances where post natal depression occurs and the mother has no interest in the baby and could neglect it, this may be why the nurse/doctor asked "do you like her" it may sound like a silly question but it could be a way to help gauge what Lena's post birth mindset was.
PARKER ❤️❤️❤️ I called the name in your name suggestion video! So perfect for her ❤️
cutest family i ever did see 🥺
Omg she is sooooooo pretty for being a newborn!!!!!!!!!!!!
She’s gorgeous 🥺🥺 congratulations mama ❤️❤️
You two deserve every bit of happiness this baby is going to bring you ❤️✨👏🏼
She has Lenas beautiful eyes 💕 congratulations guys! She’s perfect!!!
Congratulations on your sweet baby girl she’s so beautiful, also her little sounds at the end 🥺🥺🥺
I never seen a baby have their eyes open for that long what a little angel may god keep blessing y’all ❤️❤️❤️
I am so happy to see the baby and how emotional Adam got. My mom is weird and enjoyed the c section more than her natural birth. She said she was ready to go after the c section but the natural birth she had to take it easy. I am surprised they didnt give you anything for the itching.
Morphine makes u itch soooo bad! I wish u guys the best with the new babe!!!!! Parker! Love the name! ❤️❤️
omg you can already tell shes gonna be such a daddies girl <3 congratulations you two <3

Yooooooo Adam for your next baby if you want the bay to be born quickly get Castrol oil from cvs or Walgreens and the baby will be here in 30 min my mom did this for 3 of her kids blessings bro congratulations 🙏🙏
Congrats on the baby. Y'all just be there for each other and Adam, bro. Take it from a guy who's wife had 2 c sections. Whatever she need. Do it! Happy wife, Happy life dude.
I was in a twilight when my son was born via c section. After a failed induction. After planning an un-medicated birth.   There’s a lot of complicated feelings that go along with it for some. Know you’re not alone. Know you’re still amazing and you absolutely gave birth! ❤️
“Do u like her?” Nooooooooooooo why tf ask
Did that lady just ask you “do you like her” to your own baby 😂😂😂
This video made me smile so big 😭❤️
i feel like it’s so rare for a newborn to be like actually cute. like some of these babies come out looking like straight aliens. but this baby is too precious 🥺🥺
Lena is meant to be a mom! I can just feel it! Congrats Adam and Lena! She’s beautiful 🧡

Lena I'm sorry your birth plan didn't go as you wanted it to but I'm glad you and Parker are healthy. I 100 % understand your feelings about worrying if you're doing things right. I'm a first time mom too my daughter turned 1 in October.  Believe me I questioned almost everything I did lol but trust yourself you'll do everything right. Wishing you and Adam nothing but the best. You'll both be amazing parents to Parker. Lastly best of luck with your breastfeeding journey 💪🏻.
Who knew these two would have the most beautiful family ever !?!?🥺
Congrats on the beautiful baby girl ❤️
Congrats bro

I love how Adam is as a dad now lol how cute to watch him jump into daddy mode
IVE HAVE 3 C-Sections. & OMG I am itching just watching this!! It’s HORRIBLE!! But the after care really isn’t that bad! & I know exactly what you mean I always wanted to be able to have a natural birth.. & my body got stuck at a 3 for 24hrs with my first baby and unfortunately I had a c-section but it is still an amazing experience!
She’s so beautiful, wish only positivity n happiness for you and the baby Lena💛
wow i never even knew they were expecting, good job recommended for failing me again💓
Oh my god. I freaked out during c section and they wouldn’t put me out. I cried the whole time. It literally hurt so bad. And I could feel them moving things. Ugh I feel for all csection mommas.
She’s the cutest baby ever
Omg this is the most adorable vlog EVER!!! So many memories of my mommy experience and isn’t it insane how you “plan” to have your baby one way and it’s like they know so they make sure the opposite happens!  Your swaddles looks so good!  Ahh thank you for sharing this!! You’ll be so happy you have it recorded.
She’s definitely her mamas twin ♥️ she has lenas eyes 👀🖤

I’ve never seen a cute new born baby until now!!!! So happy for you guys!!!
It was soooo heartwarming seeing you both as parents! You guys are naturals , and Lena is sooo strong , like nothing major even happened. Your baby girl is so perfect. ❤️
I came back to this just to say how strong lena is. She’s up and walking around as If she never even had surgery. After I had my son (vaginal delivery) it was so damn hard to get up the first time and get she was just cut open and acted no different.
Lena in the hospital is the most realistic view of a birth vlog I’ve seen on YouTube so accurate for how moms feel and process everything
You killed it lena!!! Congratulations, she's so gorgeous!
She looks happy to be out haha
Those EYES omg!😍
The nurse “do you like her” da fug
Congrats two both you now your cat got a younger sibling!
I was betting she’d be born on my birthday the 25th!! Congrats guys! She’s precious.

PARKER AWWW
I never usually comment on any YouTube videos, but I’ve watched you for years Adam and watching this made me really proud and genuinely happy for you and Lena. Congrats man.
She’s beautiful. Congratulations guys
This is so similar to my l&d story! I was supposed to have a water birth with my midwife and ended up with a c-section 11 days past due. Lena, you will be just fine with the healing process and caring for your sweet girl! So happy for you guys! Congratulations! <3
Omg she looks so Armenian😍 CONGRATS!
All these women bonding over pregnancy. And my high ass is thinkin of Lena off the preggy percs
You guys are so amazing, and she is absolutely beautiful! Congrats ❤️❤️
She's so cute! And I don't like or want babies or kids. How long was she? I think I was 23 or 24 inches, and I'm 5'11". Hopefully she's a tall girl!
She is so cute 😭 I’m glad everything went ok! I had to get an emergency c section also and I was so scared but it was all worth it at the end. 💜 you guys are going to have so much fun with her, she will truly change your life forever!
LMFAOOO what was that reference to rap lyrics and pain killers at the beginning??? how weird ahhaha
she's literally perfection
She’s literally so damn cute, she looks like a doll.
You both are such loving parents!
She is Oh So ADORABLE!! 💕😭
I'm not crying you are omggg
The nurse asked if she likes her to help detect any postpartum/baby blues, she wasn’t asking a dumb question. Just wanted to clarify for those commenting on it. Congrats Lena and Adam💗💗💗
It sounds like your experience was very similar to mine. I wanted a natural birth but it didnt go that way for me. I had the balloon and the pitocin. Couldn't dilate past a 5 and my water had already been broken for 6 hours. Pitocin sent my son into a panic and it had been too long. Had to have an emergency cesarean and was so drugged up I thought I was terrified. Couldn't move, puking in my hair but not able to lift my head after the epidural and the blockage during the procedure. Once my son was put in my arms nothing else mattered in the world. Congratulations guys. 💙
The way Lena held the baby and stared at it the entire time while they were taking her to the room 🥺 she’s going to be so loved and cared for, I wish you three nothing but the best!
AYYYY FINALLY YAY HAVENT EVEN WATCHED YET BUT CONGRATS 💜💖💜💖
lena looking at her baby when she was getting wheeled in backwards literally made my heart like......dude that was like........indescribable like wow congrats to u both

OMG I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.   1st son,  28 hours Labor Vaginal Delivery, 2nd Baby 36 Hours, and an Emergency C-section. I missed it all,  so did my husband.

Itching is an allergic reaction to the pain meds. It’s not pleasant
I had a emergency c-section and they are awful! But she’s 22 years old now and the thing you have to take away from it is that she came through happy and healthy!! Congratulations to you two and to all your families !!! And BTW you never stop worrying!!!

Awe poor Lena! The pregnancy probably felt so long for you, and with your heart rate dropping I’m sure it wasn’t easy. You’re such a strong mom!❤️ I can’t wait to see more videos of the baby 🥰
The nurse was just being funny when she asked if she liked her of course she knows she loves her baby. That's why she said it she saw Lena was very emotional about it so she was just adding in a joke. Y'all need to relax.
The most beautiful baby girl ever 😍😍

Wow so amazing. Thank you for sharing your experience and your baby girl with us!  She is beautiful ❤️❤️ congratulations
She is SOOOO PRECIOUS!!!! I literally screamed with joy when the camera went on her. Great job mama!! My oldest saw his dad before he saw me, they rushed him to the NICU and dad was able to go visit while I was getting cleaned up. He has an amazing bond with his father. Adam, that 40 minutes will pay off, she’ll probably be a daddy’s girl! Congratulations to you 2!! 🎉❤️

Sooo cute! Congrats
I love you guys you'll be awesome parents ❤️
Had a very similar birth story hope all is well she is so Precious 🤍 perfect mixture of you both
omg I’ve never been so emotional
It’s the milk jug in front of the breast for me 😂😂😂😂 7:00
Lena you’re such a good mommy already! That motherly instinct just kicks in. And Adam you seem like a really good daddy as well.
So after making money selling pregnant porn, they’re monetizing the birth as well. Not surprised. Pretty disgusted.
Omg I started crying when Lena was first looking at her 🥺🥺💕 I didn’t want kids until I saw you get pregnant ngl
This video was too short! I need more 😍😍 congratulations!
She is gorgeous, her eyes are enormous. The first couple of weeks after an c-section are rough but you will feel normal again I promise. I think I just cried for two weeks solid then one day I just woke up and felt like a normal person again. Just relax as much as you can and you’ll be good. I couldn’t because I was alone but even then the pain only lasted a few weeks. Congratulations, you are going to be the best mum.
she’s the cutest little thing ever 😭😭
So cute omg!!!! So happy for you both!
The balloon is the absolutely worst. I never could get past a 4 and ended up with a c section
The 46 people that hit the dislike button < The Normal 8.3k human beings

I have been watching this relationship build for a number of years.  Where you started to where you are now is amazing. The love you have for each other is so REAL and beautiful and now this baby girl just EVERYTHING!!  I could ABSOLUTELY FEEL the love the three of you have for each other. I haven’t ever watched a birth vlog that made me feel the raw emotion that this one did. Needless to say, I am TRULY so happy for you!  She is adorable and just the perfect fit!♥️♥️

Tony and Parker, BFFS in the making.
Did the nurse just ask “Do you like her?” Like wut? That’s her daughter what?! LOL
“dO yOU LikE heR?”  “Nah we just met I can’t tell”
Lena was eating too fucking much lol
I had the same experience and had to be completely put out during my section due to feeling what they were doing and panicking
She’s perfect!
SO CUTE!! Congrats <3
She is so beautiful!! Congratulations to you all!!
Congratulations she’s so perfect ❤️
She is so beautiful, congratulations family! My husband too bonded with our daughter after my csection. It was a moment he'll never forget. She's been a daddies girl since! She's ten months old now but it seems like yesterday she was this little. It's so crazy to think how we ever lived without them!! Enjoy every second. And all those wonderful hormones 😜

Seeing Adam so vulnerable is so nice

Congratulations, this made me cry..so sweet
Congratulations 💘
you’re so lucky they put you under when you had a panic attack. they refused to give me anything until i had actually gone through the c section. it was unbelievably traumatic for me and i’m so happy you didn’t have to have the same experience. congratulations to you both ❤️
She is perfect❤️
Baby girl is beautiful congratulations you guys
Lena is a freaking freak of nature. she looks so natural after surgery and just done everything flawlessly
Did that nurse ask her if she liked her.? Nah Bitch I don't like my daughter. TF?! Hahaha congrats guys 😁
She looks just like her daddy! Congrats to you two! Such a beautiful Video !!!!! <3
It’s the morphine in the epidural that causes the itching. I had claw marks all over my body from the scratching!
LENAAAAA

All this and she looks just like Adam 😭
My 17 month old little girl is a Parker!!! So a special name! ☺️ so happy for y’all! Little girls are the best!
SHOCKING LAST MINUTE C SECTION... THE BABY IS BLACK?!?!?!?!
Everyone asking why the nurse would ask if they like her or not, the nurse is simply doing the baby’s first vibe check obviously 🤦🏽‍♂️

THE WAY THIS MADE ME CRY!!!!!! Awe I'm so happy for you guys!
Why is Lena naked in the portrait 😂
Coming from a fellow csection mama it’s tough! (All birth is but that’s not the point) I was induced and in active labor for 36 hours. My epidural stopped working after 7-8 hours. I was stuck at 8cm for over 10 hours it was awful. Was on Pitocin then off it because it was affecting my sons heart rate. Then on it again. My son also swallowed some of his own poop so it started getting dangerous. I tried so hard and I did NOT want a csection I always wanted a vaginal birth and still something feel sad about not having it but it was what was best for my son who instead of going towards the light he went up basically into my ribs lol  Then during my csection they had to pretty much get ontop of me and push him out of my ribs and ended up brushing my ribs.   He was perfectly healthy thankfully but my recovery SUCKED. it was awful and I’m 100% traumatized. If I ever have another baby I’m gonna try for a vbac because I’m so terrified for another csection lol   You did amazing! Pregnant for over 42 weeks? I could never lol congrats girl! All the pain is so worth it. My sons 4 months now and he’s the best thing to ever happen to us! Congrats again guys 😭❤️
Congratulations !!!!!!!
The smile at 14:40 melted my heart!!! Congratulations!
Oh!!
The nurse lmao “are you recor-“ cuts off
I’m balling. I’m so happy for you guys. Lena, you are so strong!! Y’all are already amazing parents. I can’t wait to see her grow. Congratulations 💕💕💕

CONGRATULATIONS!! ❤️😭 So happy for y’all 🥰
Wow. When Lena was first holding her in her arms I was tearing up. It was really beautiful to see Adams soft side and that unexplainable love. Cant wait for the vlogs to come. Congratulations you guys💕
The cat is like “who tf is that”. 😂
I don't know what it is but these kinda vlogs make me cry instantly lmao
Lena you are amazing and that baby girl is gorgeous! Congrats Mom and Dad ❤️
What the fuck kind of question right after you get a baby cut out of you "do you like her" like what is she going to say? No can you put her back?
This video was so beautiful!  Congratulations!!
Congrats Lena omg I love you Adam and baby so much
"Do you like her?" Lmao what kind of question is that??
Congratulations!! She’s beautiful. 🥰 I had a very similar birth story with my first. My body just wouldn’t dilate. They tried everything. Sweeping membranes, breaking water, suppositories of cytotec, and pitocin...and after many many many hours of labor, I ended up with a csection. Luckily, i healed with no scar. When they were prepping the area for my second csection, the nurses didn’t believe that I’d had one previously. My doctor was very proud of her handiwork. I also had very little pain. I was very lucky in that regard. Some women have such a hard time after a c-section.  Made me realize I shouldn’t have been so stubborn about holding out and insisting on having him the old fashion way. 😜
The cutest!, congratulations to you and Adam she’s beautiful and I love her name! ❤️❤️❤️
3x c-section mom! They are such a long hard recovery. Praying for a speedy recovery for you
I had my baby in June, it was hard having my first baby during a pandemic but i couldn’t imagine it happening any other way
CONGRATULATIONS, your a beautiful mum &adam kicking dad goals already..so happy 4 you's. So "parker " is her name!beautiful

You slept through your Csection?! I kept asking my nurse if I could fall asleep and kept waking me up 😂 also how were you not leaned over when you were standing up right after your csection 😂 I could barely stand up straight I was walking through the halls leaned over feeling like I’d rip open if I stood straight up 🙃
The snoo is such a lifesaver at night 🥺 parents get a lot of sleep with it but getting them off it is hard - at least with twins it is
omg does she have adam's eyes?!
She's so beautiful!! Lena do u plan on teaching her Armenian?
So happy for y’all. Feel like a close friend and his girl just had a baby together... makes me so happy to see Lena and the babygirl happy & healthy. Been such a journey from the first vlog with Lena and all the growth.. etc. it’s amazing man 😭❤️
She has the most gorgeous eyes! 🥺
I’m sobbing. Absolutely sobbing

I got itchy when mine was wearing off!! I had my husband scratch my legs with a brush!!!! Congrats pretty ♥️♥️
C sections are no big deal at all. People have it in their heads it’s some big thing. It’s far far safer for the child and the mother.
upside down cross ...why?

You guys literally made a perfect baby
I’m not crying you are
Am I the only one who got anxiety by the way she was holding the baby at 10:42 ? 😭
Much Blessings you guys Thankyou for sharing this loving moment...life will bless your daughter with lots of ❤️ love 💕💕💕💕💕...
Literally the first actually cute newborn baby I’ve ever seen
They gave me Claritin after my c section because I was so itchy! You’ll be the best momma and she’s so beautiful!
i actually can’t believe this is real this is so cool
Omg I didn't know you were 2 weeks over due poor thing! I'm so happy for u and adam bless your new family!
Congrats...I knew she was going to look like lena, she's got your face, also she seems long on video so I think she's going to be tall like Adam!! The name Parker is adorable, it goes with the family!  Lol you know what I mean lol
She is perfect ! I can’t tell you how relieved I am to see a new mom have a normal c-section story, I’m scheduled for one on 3/27 because I’m having twins and I needed to see this. I knew about the itchiness, what I was surprised about was the lack of excruciating pain the day after !
what a cute and chill baby :)
Did the nurse actually say, “do you like her?” What the fuck kind of question is that after a mom gives birth?! 😂🤣 geeze
“Are you recording?” *cuts camera suddenly* is recording not allowed?!!!
dude youve known tony for like 12 years.. you’ve known this baby for like maybe a day.. maybe.
I heart Carter not Parker. Either is such a cute name for her.
Omg she's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL....... congrats you guys
The milk picture while breast feeding 😂

IM CRYING SO HARD THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU GUYS FIRST MET ITS TRULY SO TRIPPY AND BEAUTIFUL
CONGRATULATIONS! This my favorite video from you both💗 how beautiful
Its very normal to itch after receiving an epidural but a C-Section is not that bad I had two natural and three C-Sections so much different than what one would expect. I know you did awesomely.  Don't blink Adam she will not be that small very long take it all in luv's...
Congrats!!!!! Lena comimg into mommyhood like a badass!!!❤❤
So happy for you both! Happy birthday Parker.
Oh Lena congratulations sweet momma 💗 I watched this twice because your candid comments are so beautiful “And all I can think about is how will I ever stop worrying about you, I don’t think I will. Ever”  This video will be such a special gift to her someday ♥️
Omggg her little sounds🥺🥺🥺 congrats she is the first beautiful new born I’ve ever seen
I just want to say congratulations and thank you! Having kids is both something I have always wanted and always been terrified of from medical side from surgery to complications; and watching Lena share her journey has actually really helped me. Girl was up the day after a C section! Like in my mind that's terrifying but thanks to you it all seems a little less scary!
My baby was born on Halloween I thought you were gonna have yours before mine but I also didn’t have a great experience. It was a lot to handle with risks for my baby and I. But now almost a month later we are doing so well! You’re so strong!
Congrats you two.
Congratulations on your guys baby!!!!
OMG SHE'S SO PRECIOUS!!! I was constantly saying "AWWW!" while I was watching this video. I'm SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH!! You both are naturals at baby life already!! Congratulations!! I can't wait to see this epic family journey unfold! Please keep up the videos,  I'll be watching them all!! Cheers!! <3

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17):

Literally cried
Congratulations! 🎉
Lena’s face when she was just staring at the baby that’s the same reaction I had! Just pure love and omg this has happened I’m a mum! 😂
No one really talks about anxiety/panic attacks before csections. I had a csection 9 weeks ago and had a huge anxiety attack as soon as they had trouble putting my spinal block in, it took them 5 attempts to get the needle in the right place.  They told me I had 2 options, receive medication by IV which could cause me to loose memory of the whole day or go under General, where they would have to kick my partner out for the process.   I chose the medication because at least one of us would witness and remember her birth. Thankfully I remember the whole birth.   Csections are not minor surgeries. I don't know what makes women decide to have one when not medically necessary. My first born was a natural birth and 10x easier even without pain relief.
Remember that moment guys. Nothing will ever compare to it. Non-parents can never understand the absolutely crippling intensity of emotions. when people say “love hurts” you don’t understand it until you have one yourself.
omg the baby has lena's eyes
IVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED AWWWW
“Do you like her”💀💀
Happy for you guys!!
Love how you guys showed the baby she’s so precious 💘💘💘
Lena i had same thing...was overdue and tried pitocin n cervadil 2 weeks in a row and like your lil angel mine was comfy in there and did not want to come out..come to find out he was facing wrong way so noway i was gonna go in reg labor...anyways not about me its about you and I am glad baby girl and mama are ok...You are amazing and sending love and prayers to your family...💗💗💗💗She is beautiful...perfection..

We going baby on baby
I’m glad they epidural worked for you though😅 I got one and it literally did not work, felt everything🥴 lol It did make me a little shaky though but I didn’t experience the itching!  Doesn’t being in labor/giving birth feel like an outer body experience? Lol
Your nurse seemed mean jeese
Congratulations ❤️ baby girl is so cute! She has big eyes 💕
Congratulations!! 😭
This is the 2nd time rewatching this . I can’t get over how amazing this is rn
Omg I got so emotional seeing Lena carrying babygirl! YOU'RE FINALLY A MILF ily
My heart has just burst for you all!!! ❤️ she’s beautiful! Lena was a absolute trooper. Adam was born to be a daddy ❤️
Congrats to you both!! Your baby is so adorable🥰
Parker was the name of my baby I miscarried, my son who's six years old now had almost the same due date as his angel sister. One day and one year later. I just had my baby girl Lorelei almost three weeks ago, she was sleeping on my chest while I was watching this. I lost my breath for a second when Adam said Parker. I'm SO happy for you guys, and I can't tell you how beautiful it is seeing baby Parker here and healthy in your arms!! I wish you guys a lifetime of happiness together! I know it's totally unrelated, but it's crazy to have gone through pregnancy with Lena, our due dates were less than a week apart, and for baby girl to be named something so dear to my heart. This brings me so much joy!
SHES SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! Congrats Lena & Adam ❤️
The epidural made me rub my nose raw!!! When I had my 2nd baby.If I would have thought about it I would have gave you a warning 😂 so excited for you guys! She’s beautiful and I love her name! Congrats again Lena and Adam! ♥️
Yes they make you sooo itchy !!!!
Lena....💕💕💕💕
Lol the nurse asking if Lena likes her baby.....  what she gonna say, nah take her back...
Wow
I rubbed my face raw with the epidural itchies!!! It was like I had a beard of redness.

Congratulations!
So so so happy for yall

My little man was over his due date and also wanted to live inside me forever. I got the balloon, I was stuck at 1 and half/ 2 for days. The balloon kick started my contractions. I got an epidural AFTER. They botched it.(had a spinal but couldnt feel from the neck down) I had a crash emergency c-section. I was traumatized, I passed out from being terrified when they said they could not detect my sons heart rate or oxygen level. Later I found out they also gave me something heavy to knock me out bc I was screaming "get him out" He spent 2 nights in the NICU due to water in his lungs and I couldnt see him for 13+ hours. But I would do it all over again 100x, bc I'm so obsessed w him. He is a mommas boy..He just turned ONE years old Nov. 2nd..CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BOTH OF YOU!!!! 🥰❤🎉🎊
So adorable her puffy little eyes are the cutest congratulations and the push present was so beautiful
SHe is perfect!!!!!! Absolutely gorgeous!!! Congrats to you both!!!!!
Parker🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
look at that stunning lil human y’all made🥺
Omg she's from adorable🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 Congratulations y'all. Only down fall is C-section a suck! I had 3.  I never fully lost my low tummy after my first one so if I see you lost it... I want to know the deets girl. I did everything. Now it's been 9 years since my last c and I still can't feel shit around the incision..  Omg when you took your hand off the baby's back and was only holding her but, I held my breathe in fear. ALWAYS hold your baby's back for support. I learned that the hard way when I first became a mom at 15😱 good thing I was on a bed. My baby wiggled and feel backwards 😲😲 I was like ok I'm fired as a fkn mom. Lol. There's no such thing as a perfect mom. We are given this intuition though and good mommas will ALWAYS take good care of their babies even when we make mistakes.
You are a strong ass woman ❤️
So her name is Parker 🥺🥺 that is so stinking cute. Congratulations 💜💜💜
SHE IS GORGEOUS💖💗💝💓 LENA AND ADAM CONGRATS❣️❣️💞
I have NEVER seen a baby so alert as soon as entering the world. Absolutely beautiful!!!!  You did a great job momma. I had 2 c-sections. I was in the hospital for days.  Adam you are glowing with your girls. I cried when you gave Lena her gift.   Enjoy the LOVE. Welcome to the world Parker. What a wonderful world your mommy and daddy will show you.
Lena is so fucking gorgeous
At 8:51 does the nurse say “do you like her?”   Btw she’s adorable 🥰
Parker?
So fucking happy for u guys.
I’m so happy for you guys congratulations you’re going to be the best parents !. I want to thank Lena personally for all of her vlogs, showing the realistic side to pregnancy. Im recently 21 and never wanted children as I only heard bad things about pregnancy and became terrified however your videos have shown me how truly beautiful, magical and such a wonderful journey and connection it all really is and so much inspiration for it and to be healthy. Now I’m so excited for the day I have my own because of you thank you!
Is her name Parker?? That’s so cute!!! Congrats!!
Okay baby girl was so calm and just like smiling back 🥺🥺💕
So precious! I have 2 girls...makes me want another 🥰
Congratulations you guys, she’s adorable! Lena you handled the complete 180° birth change with so much grace, you’re made for motherhood. I’m so happy for you two. Welcome to the world Parker! ❤️
I can not deal with the CUTENESS ❤️❤️❤️
Did anyone notice Adam say “Parker” when pointing to baby girl on the canvas? 🥺😍
Parker!!!!
OMG I wish they would have done a c-ection sooner for me. I was induced on a Friday and only dialated up to like 4.5 cm and ended up having a c-section until that Monday. It was such a long labor!
Congratulations guys she is beautiful 💜
HER NAME IS PARKER 💗 13:46
He said her name is Parker!???!!???
Congratulations guys she’s beautiful!!!!! 💯💯❤️🥰🥰😚
You handled the unexpected/disappointing change of plans with such grace! She is so lucky to have such loving, doting parents. Soak in every bit of those newborn cuddles. Sending you all love! ✨
She's nothing short of perfect😍🎀 Not telling us the name or haven't decided??

Parker🥺🖤
Way to go mommy and daddy she's absolutely beautiful.  Good push present Adam. Did Adam call her Parker?

Lena you are so strong I hope you are feeling well. She's a beautiful blessing.
Her name is Parker?
Did they say what her name is?? ❤️❤️❤️
Lena is a G 😹
Beautiful shit congratulations ❤️
Tony is jealous. I would recommend introducing the baby to the cat and give him like five maybe ten minutes of attention so he doesn’t feel left out. Cats have personalities and  can hold a grudge/ never like the baby
So happy for you guys !!!! CONGRATS
Parker?? Cute cute cute
beautiful baby Parker has lena's eyes!! I'm obsessed, she's so cute❤️️
The same thing happened to me with my son, glad you both are okay ❤️

When I saw her I just kept saying, "omg omg" outloud.
Congratulations u guys! She’s absolutely perfect 💓
I wanted a home birth too and ended up with a C-section because my baby was breech! Let yourself grieve the birth you wanted. It doesn't make you a bad mom. I know what those emotions can do. Be gentle with yourself! Love you

Omg can’t wait !! 🥰

Omg i have been waiting, what seems like 10 years, for this! Congrats Lena and Adam! A true 👑 im so sorry you're birth plan got messed up but very thankful it ended with a healthy baby and mama! ✌🏼❤😍😘
So glad youre sharing your story! Just dont feel bad to keep some precious moments to yourself! Dont let people pressure you into knowing/seeing everything.   Youre doing great, the first few weeks are hard but Im happy you guys waited before posting this. 💕
Ahh I’m sooo happy for you guys!!!❤️❤️
Is the baby's name Dolly? Did she announce the name yet?
Thats what seems to happen with child birth. You can plan everything to a "T" then BOOM the baby chooses to do her own thing and turn everything upside down. 8 cant wait for the video. I'm hoping you and baby are ok and healthy
I’ve never been more excited for anything in my life ahhh can’t wait to see and meet baby girl❤️❤️❤️😭
Uhh I keep refreshing 😩
A fucking premier ☠️
