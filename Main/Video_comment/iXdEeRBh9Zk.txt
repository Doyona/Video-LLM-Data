It's nothing like the trailer promises.
I was actually excited when I saw this, a nice throwback to the original series of the 80s in design and slight update, but then I heard the woke nonsense from Teela and lost interest, suspecting it's only a sham.. Guess I was right, Netflix are liars.
It was OK.
Good animation, but woke garbage propaganda. I will skip it.
please make more MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE please Netflix let Kevin Smith make more! for his he man show, i grew up with 200x he man  for me i love this show Kevin Smith has done, it had me in tears with several episodes
Nope. I grew up in the 80s and this is not He-Man. This is hot garbage and so is this annoying, cliché leftist version of Teela. 👌🏻🙄
The trailer speaks for itself. I am not watching this garbage.

Netflix burning money on season 3 of She-Ra 😂 No one cares about this 💩. At least Kevin knew to keep his mouth shut after this disaster 🤣
When does it air ?
He-Man dies but comes back to life 3 episodes later. So many incels cried over his death.
Die neue Staffel von Mathemann sieht wild aus
Kevin Smith go to hell.
i feel like if Teela was going to be a focus, at least let her look cool
WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO GET IT ON DVD 📀 BECOUSE IM A MASSIVE ALICIA SILVERSTONE FAN N CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR HER VOICE 😲 AS THE QUEEN 👑 MARTHA  N BE ABLE TO COLLECT IT ON DVD 📀📀📀📀 TO COMPLETE MY PERFECT COLLECTION OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE BACK CATALOGUE OF ALICIA SILVERSTONE 📀📀📀📀.
Lovethe show
Mathemann! Wer ist hier nur wegen Matheman?
Let’s see 1983, 2002 (I think), annnnnnd 2022 wow… I still love classic
I was born 82 buy time he-man was ending I was geeked out with transformers and tmnt but i had the hole thing on VHS forget what everybody else told you or what you thought you can pick this up and not know nothing and it hits hard this series is the shi........😮 New fan,old fan it claps
2002 He Man Was great 💔
Really can’t wait for season 2 . Hopefully we get to see she ra and have her team up with he man
QUERIA VER HE-MAN E ME BEM COM TYLA.....AEW PE DE LASCAR
when you think about it, It kind of makes sense why the show is called just “Masters of The Universe” instead of “He-Man and the Masters of The Universe.” At least that’s how I see it
Kevin Smith should be kept as far from a director chair as possible. It's been almost 20 years since anything he was attached to was worth a damn.
Shaniqua twerks Transgendia
Master of the universe? Heman!
There should be added more villain like King Hiss & Hordak from next season
will we get a season 3?
ഗ്രേസ്ക്കൽ  കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി  എന്നുള്ളിൽ ഒതുങ്ങി വാ  ശക്തി  കൂടി വാ ❤️🔥
I don't know who made this trailer, but they deserve an award for making it so amazing. That award should then be shoved up their ass sideways for making a trailer that has nothing whatsoever to do with the show.
I still prefer the original. They used to be educational shows. My 2 year old loves the 80's one 😊😊😊
Trash
This is one of the reasons why I cancel my membership to Netlfix, first thing was The Witcher!
Netflix doesn't wanna get "Go woke, go broke"
Skeletor meme
Kevin Smith´s stupid ideas can ruin your childhood even if it´s long gone.
Where is heman you basterds Netflix
Please dub in hindi
this sucks
The trailer does show anfraction of He-man’s screen time. He’s literally in every episode. Anyome claimimg he got rid of him hasn’t watched or just hates the OP He-Man.
This is the one version of He-Man that needs to be put on Testosterone Replacement Therapy...
Imagine having a trailer about a movie where the person talking isn't the person the movie is about or not talking about the movie is about.
No that's horrible heman revelation shieet'ss...
Ogly Tela man... Y black King Greiskull???
Ogly heman
It's a kk...
Remember watching this trailer and hoping it would be good?
just because you buy something does it mean you have the right to changed I say it's about He-Man Star Trek or anyting just because you had the money does it make it right as far as I'm concerned a dead horse has more imagination than a bunch of you.
In the movie Ready Player One they showed He-Man wielding his sword but the bottom part was gold
Oops. My 'r' and 'f' are sticking. No, I can spell! lol.
Loved this and binged both seasons in a day. A fresh take with great visuals. The whiny incels in the comments are amusing to me. Oh noes, other people besides He-Man get character development. This is an outrage! LMAO
After watching this i lost my mind . Why you do this ? Make everything in ultra HD is not good and this is the perfect example . Old serial is gold . Why kind of Heman look like a "bacha" . 🤮🤮
Fart!
U might Not Like in the 1st half, but the second killed it... 🔥🔥🔥
BHAGWAAN KALKI MAHARAAJ Master of the UNIVERSE
Cool
SE VIENE I-VAAAAAN!!!  SHEGOOOOOO EL BIGOTEEEEE!!!!! COLORADO, TE DOY MEDIA HORA PARA SOLTARME!!!!
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
It’s masters of the universe, not master of the universe.
He-Man is not black now? Wooo risky. :o
clearly these people deleted all the comments and deleted dislikes, wow
Nothing like the original.... Netflix, you simply suck big time...
Terrible bait and switch show.  Get woke go broke as usual.
I don't know what's worse.  The bait-&-switch, or the fact that there was legitimately interesting ideas in this show that could've worked if they hadn't been squandered so heavily and delibereatley.  A dark mature heavy metal tone and Skeletor getting He-man powers of his own sounded like cool ideas(at least to me).
One of the best sequel series I've ever seen. Could not believe how good it was. Highly recommend for any fan of the original. So much love and appreciation of the wider world. Feels like a proper fleshed out universe with real characters now. Fell in love with it all.
He-Man is only one!wtf two swards!hahah.for me is the best old he-man!
Thanks,for streaming it on Netflix!! Like DreamWorks animation Shera ,the princess of power 2019,-21 and new,,- he man and the masters of the universe!! 2021.
Man, I knew something was wrong with Kevin Smith the minute he posted that stupid photo of himself crying at Wandavision's ending
Lena voice yohhh Cool
I thought Kyle Dunnigan was joking.  Kevin Smith drank to much liberal juice.  Went from cult hero to leader of the dickless cult.
My name is Himan (He-man)
I sense thousands of angry whiners and desperate attention seekers impotently cry out words like "absolute failure" and "sjw" and "Hollywoke". I also sense millions of He-Man fans well satisfied with a tv series.
As a proud feminist I LOVE the concept and the show. A+++ to Netflix
when’s the skeletor show first airing? i will wait long and hard for the day to come.
Make he man roller coaster and ps5 game
How do you people not realize that story arcs are a thing? Has the instant gratification of Netflix made you the most spoiled little dicks ever? It is quite apparent that He-Man will be the biggest part of the second half. I get that the original was episodic but this version is obvious more long term.
i like it <3 it's better than the old series
Sorry. This show is awful. There is no other way to say it.
woah! its nothing but salt and tears in the chat...
amazing show, i can't wait for part 2.
So much hate. You are all so blinded and you can’t see that Adam might not actually be dead. Just look where the spear went thru.  Secondly. This part one. Netflix did use the few shots of He-Man to get people watching, but you all refuse to see the potential of this show.  And a real struggle for Adam to grow, seek out his own power from within, recover the sword, and defeat Skeletor once and for all.
Лучший способ уничтожить франшизу, это переделать её под современные веянья и понятия. И я правда не понимаю, какого хрена, эта дичь является продолжением моего любимого сериала в детстве. К аниматорам вообще никаких вопросов, все на высшем уровне. Но феминистский сюжет, уж извините, пусть останется меньшенству, а не нормальным людям.
He-man's tiger is missing 🤔
boring. just watched castlevania n blood of zeus is better
This is a pure scam. Netflix Scam.
Nice a remember He man started at 5 september, 1983  i guess. 😏 I was 7 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
" where skeletor"
All these people complaining about this series and calling it a disaster... I get wanting He-Man to be the focus of a He-Man series. But, this series is well written, well animated and well choreographed. It seriously does not deserve the hate it's getting. I, for one, loved  it and am really excited for part 2.
So if a much larger number of people (107K) liked this trailer and far less (17K) hated it, why do we only see the negative comments? Ans: Coz YouTube misleads almost as much as Netflix does.....?
Instead of just telling a good He-Man story, you know it's going to be some SJW nanny lesson with a little bit of sloppy story thrown in on the side.  Also, why does Adam look like a 12 year old girl? That was never the case back in the day. Whatever.
This show is great. All the haters can go watch their poorly-animated 80s cringe fest. I will NOT Change my mind.
Liberals got a hold of he man. Canceled. Lesbians in.
finaly new hemen....buy netflix just forh hemen :)
Netflix has become the taint on a scurvy infested rodent. Do you remember when they, for a brief second aspired to making original, quality content?  And then they cancelled everything quality and kept all the cheap trash. You ppl suck harder than a catfish on some hillbilly's foot under water
Lol look at all the people who didn’t pay attention to the show. I swear toxic fanboys are something else.
sad and bad ending of this movie is the Heman lost 😔.
Dem trick  wi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hate!!!!!!!!
Recreating is good to some extent, but they should have retained the original theme music tune that played at the end of every episode.
liars
I thought this was a marvel series🤣
Gilman y los majes del chile tierno
Where is Orko🙁
💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍👍
To tell the truth, when I first saw this trailer, I thought that Teela left the team as well as the royal palace out of disgust for the secret that Adam was He-Man. Right in front of Adam himself as well as the rest of the royal family and the Masters. That is until I saw the first 10 minutes of the first episode.
Well this is fake trailer, its not at all how the new series will look like. its catered to kids whit all new style. this i dont know why you put up.
What I learned from all of this is that you cannot hate a show because it has a women in it lol. You’ll get called a sexist and homophobic lol.
PFFFFFFFFF !!!!! hahahahahahahahhaah !!!! its a very good Joke !!!....mmmm ..is not a joke?...
I love coming back to this comment section to watch grown "men" cry about cartoons not caterng to their conservative politics.
LMAO this looks like a steaming pile of shit
The fact that use to watch this on Cartoon Network right after sailor moon would go off or maybe it was before she came on , either way now I gotta watch this -
This is final fantasy versus 13 clickbait trailer level
This is anti-man propaganda.
This is a real disappointment!!!!! Trailer and 1 chapter are nice! Everything else after that sucks BIG TIME !!!!!
Mega
if you take the most male hero ever and diversify the hell out of him...
vlo vidio
"Sooner or later, lies have a way of catching up with you." - He Man
I'd just binge-watched the first 5 episodes. I gotta say truthfully, the animation is solid but the story and the pacing is predictable. Voice acting is bad except for He-man's; he's decent. Overall, maybe it's early to tell where this is headed but hopefully, I'm assuming it's gonna get better. As of right now, they trying to hard to impress.
Awesome show 4 times through
Hi-man from 80's is much better version!!! This two version cartoon can not compare never!!!! Living 80's, living forever!!! 😉😉😉
Coming back to this comment section is always amusing
I never get tired of people hating this show
This look gangstea never got into He Man cuz I was born in the 90s 🤷🏾‍♂️
Take your politics out of entertainment. We need few min break from all politics but you keep on pushing your woke material. I am tired of this shit.  I hate Teela so much I could watch more than 1 episode.
Rename the show as She woman 😂
The show was not what I expected but I didn’t mind too much. My favourite part of he-man was his line and the cat roar. I felt the actor could have been stronger when he says I have the power. Also really pissed at the ending but I hope they fix it the next season. 2 characters need to come back to life and we are good. I love Lena who did the voice for Evelyn. Recognized her right away😂. One gripe I saw a lot of black characters but no black voice actors. Felt like fan service .
This is just LMAO at this point😂 I'm not even mad hahahaha
Once is an opsee, twice is on purpose!
WTF.. RIP He-man K. Smith and Netflix killed you..
What happened to you Netflix, where's the charm you used to have?
His lesbian looking freind was annoying but He man himself was epic for the 2 seconds he was in his own show
Fking Scamers
This did not age well
Netflix destroyed our perfect super hero and I thought the are going to start fr where the last season of masters stopped...shame on you guys
Where is part 2?
Maybe this is just the start - and there will be more to follow ? It can't just be left with skeletor as the master of the universe
Ezreal transforms into Garen.
Is everybody brunette?? It's not a problem itself, but come on, is He-MAN... just Netflix being Netflix... thanks god now I have HBO Max.
This season was awesome and now you suddenly have a horrible CGI reboot no no no
Netflix really are enjoying raping He Man lately. First this then that CGI puke abomination.
SO BAD
This is why He-Man and the Masters of the Universe 2002 is the superior reboot. Heck, even the New Adventures of He-Man series and the movie 🍿 version is better than this thrash reboot.
💩
Remember when kevin smith swore on his daughters life about He-Man?
Mentally ill SJW's are ruining pop culture. enough pandering the crazies. these deranged lunatics have to be removed from all studios and production companies.
What trash is this?
Netflix buying thumbs up lelelel
Damn it!!! Part 2 now!!!!
Lol, the like ratio says this is a great show but the comments say otherwise. Netflix and YouTube are both pathetic. This crap is bought and paid for.
I just looked at the new He-Man trailer. 😂 Netflix has comments turned off. I think they at least half ass learned their lesson.
Propagandaflix
Netflix is trash and most of the shows on Netflix are  trash so its not surprising that this looks like trash too.
Finally, they give some importance to Teela in history to show how she goes become the new Sorcerers, I watch all and I loved it, I m crazy for watching part 2,  I hope they developed the Adam history and maybe She-Ra comes to help... She has the other sword.    Unfortunately,  have some stupid old  "fans" saying stupid things. putting all series, evaluated in just 1 season.
They definitely messed with the like to dislike ratio.  Because all I see is negative comments
Well, Im ullready disagree with one point, Sheera was femenin and powerful, that was the point, she don't need to imitate a man or being more tough for being strong and potent... That was the point, power and femeninity.  I mean, the woman power today is divided, I know, but the original thing was cooler, is like dressing with a suit and tie to proof what strong you are as a woman. 😐
La nueva serie de He Man, es una porquería podrida por el repugnante feminismo y hembrismo. Un total asco, basura y decepción.
There already female version of He-Man, she call She-Ra why the heck you make another female version of this show
Not only is this disrespectful , but once again something else to ruin our masculinity. This is getting out of control , and needs to stop. Why not do She-ra into HE-RA! Hey might as well!
This is really grateful content
What a shit story...
This the worst waste of money ever. These Hollywood elites are out of touch, over privileged and way too arrogant to learn that you go woke will go broke. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯✅
Didn't know Big Mike was cast in this series.
Netflix destroys all that was once good.
Go watch Castlevania. Then the new Rurouni Kenshin films. Thank me later
The animation looks great.  The trailer looks fun, but I'm hearing from others that it's yet another one of those shows where I'm supposed to cheer on a women that embodies toxic masculinity (because somehow I guess it's good when they act like that) and I'm so tired of those.  And we're supposed to laugh at the dumb male and I'm sure at some point she's going to slap He-man for a stupid reason and that's supposed to be cool or funny or something.  I'm getting tired of that kind of stuff, so I'll take the heads up and avoid watching yet another show where I'm told men are stupid and it's cool when women are rude.
Imagine being so woke..lol clowns
Can we started a petition to get (creator of Samurai Jack) Genndy Tartakovsky to make a good He-Man series. Instead of Kevin Smith mediocrity 🤔
The biggest lie Netflix did, what a stunning and brave this show is. 🤡🤡🤡
HE Man is killed off almost immediately and it's basically an intersectional Tela self-gratification series. She is so masculine she even has a ball bulge! this is simply politics and a fourth wave feminist orgee
It's He-maaaaam!
He man barely in part1. Will also barely be in part 2 because show will focus on evil Lyn. Skip this show if you want to see he man.
Damn the show was only relevant for two minutes to be made fun of
Its a farce!
Woke garbage!  Somehow they screwed this up. 🤦‍♂️
Holy Jeez, It’s not all about He-Man. It even says it in the title “Master’s of the Universe” You people need to relax
What utter woke crap
Heard He-Man got CANCELLED in his own reboot by woke-as-hell Netflix, lol! Oh Kevin Smith, it might be the end of the line for you... XD
I hope your expectations were subverted.... Thanks Kevin....
ISSA lagla like korben
Feeling cheated
Great job ripping out everything that made He-Man great.
I was excited about this show until they started revealing weak plots & political agendas. Kinda like approaching an extraordinarily attractive woman only for her to open her mouth and reveal a vapid personality, rotting teeth & cigarette breath. Takes you from "yowza" to "what a damn shame" REAL fast. Unless you're desperate enough that you say, "Maybe I can convince her to wear a gag for a night or two...?" Not sure how that would translate here.... Maybe watch MotU with the volume off...? 🤷‍♂️
After reading reviews,  very hard pass.
i knew it from the start netflix will never stop hunting our best franchieses
Wow the likes are either non creatives who can't draw and cant story or YT altered them
Horrible woke crap
Bl**ddy a*oles destroyed one my favorite series .. netflix m cancelling u.. dpmt want to waste my money on ur crap
Master of the Universe, absolute trash.
Give us Mathe mann back
It's not He-Man, it's Tom-Boy!
You managed to ruin huge potential. Congratulations.
I bet children love this show. I wish nostalgic adults would remember that they ought to be the secondary demographic for kids' media not the primary one. You can still watch old He-man you silly geese.
Keep your woke agenda and I will keep my money!! Bye Bye NetGarbage.
This is as old as my age
Nive
Wonderful
Old He-Man for little kids, this He-Man for the big kids! We know He-Man come back and give Teela love.
Emmmm… what happened to the “ Red Iron Cross” in the crear of the original He_Man?
Why is it every time WOKE does a powerful woman she’s a boring lesbian that acts like a man but in the 80s a strong women possessed power and womanly characteristics like nurturing and caring?  Also isn’t it hypercritical she’s leveraging off He-Mans name? Typical of woke.
This is utterly garbage.
Kevin smith is so trash
SCAM!
g4y
This is like when Hollywood killed off John Connor from Terminator!
I was expecting just a reboot of the original cartoon.  What we got was a sequel taking the story line in places it's never been taken before.  Giving life and soul into a show that although I LOVED as a kid, I know was a pretty much toy commercial now.  It was amazing.  Any dates on Part 2 yet?
nice this vidio
I saw the 5 episodes….and they were ALL GARBAGE. This storyline is TRASH!
Hopefully everyone who liked this trailer comes back and leaves a dislike
Somebody tell KS to contact me over the rights to his overhyped Clerks franchise so I can get permission to reinvent Jay and Silent Bob as Trump supporters who believe in Making America Great Again.  Let's see how well that pos response to that "realistic reimagining."
Lol not he man and the female masters of the universe 🙄lol so this is a joke 👎
omg... what shit in the wood is this?
Why is Teela the main character yet she has the whiniest worst voice actor in the show? I laughed until I cried when I heard her puny "fOr ETErnIa!1!!1" Line in the first episode.
Netflic and Kevin Smith have no idea of MOTU 😆😆😆....this is a clickbait, this is a 💩💩💩
When you make a series to just appeal to just one person an executive this is what you get.
😔👎 This is so infuriating i ALMOST UNINSTALLED NETFLIX!
Dont trust this trailer. Kevin smith rlly messed this one up
again and again and again they do this shit...so sad
This blows. I’m a girl and loved the she-ra series as a kid. I was looking forward to the remakes and now their both ruined.
The animation and fight scenes are great. Killing off both He-Man and Skeletor made it like one of those dark animes. The writing is great and they make jokes about the bad 80s cartoon writing of the old episodes.  I don't care what the incels say. THIS IS AWESOME.
The 80s He-Man show was my favorite as a kid, and I loved the 2002 animated series.  This looks like it's going to be bad ass!  I hope it's a hit show on Netflix.
It was great, great, great 👍👍👍
Soy un trolazooooo
Just continue the 2002 series with the original writers or GTFO!
Least the animation's nice. Go Powerhouse!
He Man Fans: We want an awesome anime sword and sorcery adventure with He Man! Yeah! Kevin Smith and Netflix: You want a woke show with steroid lesbian Teela and next to no He Man. Gotcha.
Fun fact: DC Comics did this He Man story better. Look it up. Teela even looks like a woman in it and has a romance with ADAM. She's blonde tho. Mer Man isn't made into a joke either. Look it up!
This is why you don't give He Man to a STONER to do.
So admit it, who here was hanging out on 4/8-Chan when someone hit the 'QUICK! There's a thing we must go and pretend to be upset about!' button? Matt Graves is definitely one. And the person trying to pretend that they're a woman who is deeply upset that I assumed that this is yet another 4/8-Chan neckbeard brigade assault on something.   There have been five (5) episodes. It's not a remake, it's a continuation of a franchise. I liked He-Man growing up. It was fun, campy, and I didn't have any concept of 'quality'. Being four years old when it first aired. Went to see the awful movie with Dolph as part of a friends' birthday - think I was five? Whenever it came out. THAT was awful, as a kid I remember thinking 'but this isn't He-Man'. Didn't fill me with vitriol. Didn't make me have a tantrum about it. It was something that happened.  Now, I have watched the five episodes and... it was okay. It's not brilliant. The source material wasn't exactly great to begin with. It was okay though. There will be new fans of He-Man, I'm sure, as a result. Younger fans. And, this is *really* important - they're allowed to like it. Or not. But it wasn't 'not brilliant' because TeelaisalesbianImusttrytobeasfuckingoffensiveashumanlypossiblebecausethenpeoplewillstopengagingwiththeinternetandthenIwin. It was told in a way that so many other stories like that are told.  So for those of you who claim you were fans from the start but are still resorting to your 'bUt MEn aRe oPprESseD!1!' diatribe, for fucks' sake - if you're my age then you're forty years' old! For the rest - especially the 'I'm entitled to my opinion...' douchebags - FOAD. The Universe will be a much nicer place for it.
Kevin you sucks.   Te-Man and the political Correctness of the Gendiverse  By the Power of Rainbowskull  André the new black lesbian transgender Di-Man ...  🖕
The trailer was deceptive.   The show was pretty good, but they alienated a large chunk of the audience once the deception was revealed.
I'm so glad that I cancelled my Netflix subscription.
And to top off covid... we have something arguably worse...
I would have thought Mattel learned their lesson about false advertising with Barbie but apparently not.
Literally have no idea why people pay for netflix. It's basically guaranteed to be garbage whenever they do anything. Have not seen one decent original programming from them ever.
Guys, have you heard the good news yet ? This woke garbage got kicked out of Netflix top 10 in ONE week. Yup, just one. We won !! Now let's wait for its cancellation. I want to see Kevin Smith cry and choke on his own tears.
Fuq this BS...... i thought animation was supposed to get better after 30 years.... what a joke
Send Kevin Smith to the retirement home where Pauly Shore, Vanilla Ice, Kid n Play, and other washed up 90's youth culture personalities are being taken care of.
WHAT A SHOW?  Where is He-Man?  I love me some Shera but therer is He-Man and Shera  (Both are equal in my book) so why get rid of Heman?  Awful show, stopped watching at the start of the second episode!!!!!
there actually ppl still watching this crap in 2021 ??? lol my side
I think Netflix needed to release all 10 episodes at once
Kevin Smith might say Netflix doesn't care about the fans but they do care about my subscription and I find the price getting a little too high along with lack of programming that I'm into.  If a show is good enough I would keep my subscription just to watch it, but this show misses the mark.  It has top notch animation and voice acting, but the lack of He-Man is a deal breaker in my opinion.
Why, why, why go away so hard from the source material!  Oh let’s make Woke-man….  Insulting to the franchise and characters.   Guess which one  becomes She-Man…..   in the follow up disaster
Oh Netflix. We pay our bill on time month after month. Why do you hate us so?
🏳️‍🌈✊🏿🤡👍🏿🏳️‍🌈
I came back to show my support for the DISLIKE button
get woke go broke
shame on you Netflix and Kevin.
THE MEDIA ARE RULED BY MINORITIES
Nahhh...this show is not that bad...     It's just the *WORST* ever
pro-religious propaganda, insteresting
Bravo! Ahora pasen una de thundercats con chitara, con novia que la admire tambien, y pantro comilon y estaremos de lo mas felices
Me, an adult man, i am shaking in my boots rn because an ip from my childhood is not the same as it was
You offered so much and delivered insults to the customers, a waste of great animation
Grown ass adults crying over a damn cartoon 😂 Chillout you He-Dorks.. Nerds of the Universe 🤣
Feministic shit
She Man
La serie debió llamarse: He man como 0 a la izquierda.
BASURA DE SERIE IGUAL QUE KEVIN SMIT
She ra cameo tho?!
I thought Netflix content was getting weaker and weaker.  This terrible show was a slap to my face and I am officially canceling Netflix.
This show was absolute pig slop. I've lost all hope in the American entertainment industry. Just woke slop after woke slop.
I was excited to watch this Netflix as I was excited about the Transformers reboot. The only thing I could say after watching it is.   ARE YOU SHITTING ME?
Masters of manginaverse
I've watched two episodes the first one was OK but the second is awful, they have taken something fans love and destroyed it? I'll put another comment when I have watched the rest
FTSIO.
Here let's do this:  **Press dislike below for this show/series** let this comment become the most disliked one, I don't care but let's vote and teach netflix a lesson for playing with our feelings like this. FYI - trailer is top notch though.
I mean, coming from a person born in the late 2000s and watched He-man when she was like 4 and forgot about all the lore of the show...                 THIS SHOW IS PURE AND UTTER GARBAGE
netflix, kevin smith, u guys fked up
Netflix and Kevin Smith are cancer. F*ck you.
Such a lie. Much suck
It is incredible how we still not learn from history. remember what happened with Transformers the movie? well, Mister Kevin  just made the same mistake.  Netflix what you've done will be remembered for ages and not in good way I dare say </>
Clickbait.
Kevin smith has been such a let down as of late. Maybe he should have passed on as a legend when he had his heart attack. Instead of becoming the thing he is now.
This trailer was 1000x better than the show.
His chest looks dumb.
Kevin Smith = a woke ass-creeper...lost all respect for you
fake news
Shite.
Woke-Man 👎
They released this on my birthday I don't have Netflix to even see it 😭
So... who is sick of all the woke BS trash?
this is garbage,id rather watch the original till im blue in the face
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TRASHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
My wife and I watched He-Man with my two oldest children. My daughter had a backpack stuffed with He-Man toys. ALL of us LOVED this series! We are ALL looking forward to the next five episodes. I knew, going in, that Kevin Smith was going to seriously shake things up and present a completely updated story, and I wasn't disappointed. If all you wanted was a recreation of the 80's cartoon, break out your DVD set and go to town. Some of us, who were fans of the old show, still liked this!
Woke garbage.
Soy Trash
Netflix been Netflix
love the 2002 he-man cartoon i hope it is like that one. But prince adam looks like a skinny homosexual and teela looks like a lesbian on steroids i hope it is still good. Teela 2002 was my waifu.
i just came back here to change my thumbs up to thumbs down. this was the biggest bait & switch of netflix history.
Troll🤑🥶
Ya dun messed everything up.
I am a huge fan of He-Man, i grew up with that series and collected all toys. And I LOVE the new series! Letting He-Man die was a great idea. And i am really ashamed to see so many people cry "its not all about boys anymore". I just expected some kind of rereremake shit you see in movies these days. But now this series... i was really suprised, in a very good way! Just keep it going. I really want to see the next 5 episodes.
Don't bother watching it.   It isn't about He-Man.
Steaming HOT GARBAGE 🗑 Thanks Kevin Bay!
I couldn't even finish it. Just gatbage woke nonsense.
The fans make the show, We should all ban the show and not watch it at all. Lying straight up and then running his big mouth calling fans fake and asking people to grow up, this guy is such a clown 🤣🤣🤣  I even unsubscribed from Netflix cuz they pay him.
Puro humo
Pandering to women always leads to ruin
Remove this and burn it, it never existed.
Oh Netflix, what a bunch of spineless woke sjw…🤮🤮🤮
Utter agenda driven garbage from a hack director. Smith should stick to schilling for disney.
Tela and the master of Wokeverse.
Second part: he-man comes back to life so he can get a sex change
can't believe Mattel was actually this clueless as to their audiences and fans when greenlighting this piece of Blasphemy.
Wow HE MAN is back super
This should be called Lesbians of the Universe.  Why?  There is no She-Man is MOTU.  Totally woke rubbish.
Thanks again Netflix, you've ruined another franchise. Kevin Smith will never get people to watch anything he makes again. Career over! 😅
Another woke garbage show...
Watched some and don't like it. You absolutely ruined He-Man.
Someone make this trailer a show! Ignore the actual nutflix version
Does silent bob die in the first  5 minutes of clerks 3?
WTF is this? please Netflix don't do this throw this trash out. it sucks.
Looks great but no He-Man… what’s the point?!
This trailer was clickbait.
Shit like this is y I canceled my subscription
Lies.  All lies.
Estas pendejo netflix  Por esta mamada me desuscribi a tu puto servicio progre
Where's the iron cross on he-mans chest?
Can you say bait and switch. This is absolute garbage
This is not He-Mans movie.  You ruin my childhood(
Went into the first five episodes without any expectations whatsoever and I must say I was pleasantly surprised (Story, characters, animation, voices, overall presentation...). It captivated me and kept me invested from the beginning of the first episode t'll the end of the fifth episode. It sure 's daring too, (to say the least) but that's strangely enough also 'part' of what kept me both captivated as well as invested and now in total anticipation for the next five episodes
This show is all about he man my ass
💩💩💩💩💩💩
:/ Netflix needs to step up.  I am really reconsidering my sub these days.
Not going to see a chapter of this shit, I prefer to keep my memories clean
Nobody gives a shit about Teela ughh
Yeah, I figured it'd be shit. Not surprised.
Netflix you saying you really don't care about how your customers feel.  I hope your stock falls and you guys can eat s#@t! And I pray that you lose thousands and thousands of subscribers hell even millions and don't forget it's the customers that got you where you are today without us you guys would just be like a Redbox
Why all the hate? I thought it was enjoyable revisiting the world. Let's be honest guys, the original was super cheesy lol
Jesus christ this comment section is fully of whiny assholes. It funny that you lot don't like Teela, you act just like her.
What a crap show. For who was this made for??🤔
What a giant tub of lard, thanks for completely destroying yet another piece of our collective childhood.
Teela 🤢🤮
Despite hearing all the negative reviews, and "The Last Jedi" (2017) comparisons, I'll admit that this "He-Man" adaptation was not as bad as I thought it'd be.
Tee-Maam and the Masters of Corporate Shilling.
This series isn't He-Man, thats She-Male.
Loved it!!!!   More!!!!
Thx for ruining my childhoods hero
Feels like Fraud.
When the western world tries to emulate anime 🐮
This was 💩💩💩💩
A He-man show without He-man. Wtf lmao. Baited all of us fans. Kevin Smith & Netflix did this show dirty. Please stop this dumb SJW, Woke, weird political agenda shit in everything. This is why Birds of Prey is absolute shit and this is why Doctor Who tanked. Because no one wants this dumb SJW shit, what do these retards not understand?
Feminist garbage!
You forgot to turn he-man in a fat Asian lesbian girl. Oh wait he is only 5 mins in the Show anyway.....btw i am not against more badass woman or other culture characters. But that forced stuff everywhere just nope
NWO
Liked when the trailer released. Now disliked. Mannn, NETFLIX HOW COULD YOU SCREW THIS UPPP. YOU HAVE SO MUCH SOURCE MATERIALLL
Another show compliments of the deep state
You know, I would have understand if Mr. Smith would have said: 'if you don't like something that is your right and it's OK. But please don't use insulting vocabulary, share your opinion but do it without this hate, please, however I respect your opinion and we will use your feedback to improve the show for you." however, Smith said: "If you don't like something don't talk about it". This is like "If you don't like something just shut up your mouth and let nobody know that you don't like it, you know because we want to sell toys and skeletor shoes. We can't do that if you share negative comments". This is just another slap in the face of fans. Really? Don't share your opinion at all because it is negative... Man... That is unprofessionell and immature!
By far the worst way to start off a series
He man Gal powah
back in the old days Adam was more man then this boy Adam.  and teela was a woman , today she  is like a transsexual. what happened to this golden era ??
Esto de las inclusiones ya es demasiado no sólo en películas ahora tambien en animaciones que por cierto este show es una basura.
Spoiler Alert:   Heman and Skeletor die in the very first episode and the rest of the series follows the  adventures of Teela and her lesbian girlfriend "of color".  They shit all over the 80's classic.
Everything is woke shit now, you could teleport me back to 1980 and I could live another happy 30 years or so.
So beautyful!! Best TV series! Thanks Kevin Smith!!! Mastermind!
It's a Bait
I think there are some problems with thie "Masters of the universe". Kevin Smith told all the time that he was a fan of classic masters and he wanted to continue the story. Well. And then something more like a modern She-Ra came out (oh, there is also a new She-RA series...). What maybe happened? It does not feel like "He-Man and the MOTU" is continued. Well the 80s series. On the other hand there was the soon cancelled MOTU 2002 series. Skeletor seems to be more the skeletor form the 2002 show. Prince Adam is not the 80s one ( the superman transformation - nobody recognizes him if the wears other clothes) . But also not an idea from Kevin Smith. It is the childish one from the 2002 show. Teela is not the one from the original show . It seems to be more the one from the 2002 show. The hidden council/Grayskull - more a continuation of the 2002 show (the desaster).  The flying disks - 2002 show. But also the flopped 2002 show was not so focused on something which makes you feel like a woke show in a bad way. The women in the 2021 Kevin Smith thing seem always to be more intelligent then the men. The Queen knows who Adam is, the King doesn't. Teela, Adora, Lynn can handle the situation and so on. Even the lame Men-At-Arms is now the most dangerous man. Even in the 2002 show death of main characters is not an issue. It is not shocking if main characters in a show now die (or die maybe twice) - it is a lame move and nt for children. You see Mossman death, Faker death, Skeletor and He-Mans "death", ripped of limbs on "vconverted" people, a Buzz Saw in Trap Jaws head... too much "violent" violence. Had hopped for more, but that is not hte 80s MOTU in modern style, it is the flopped 2002 with a bit of gore and woke at same time.
Grey skull കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി 😍💥💥💥
I just finished the series and it should be called the Teela show.
Steaming pile of woke shite.
Kevin Smith: This show is all about he-man  Me after watching the show: I said hey what's going on
Kevin Smith is a lying talentless hack.
Such a disgrace
Another leftist gay agenda twist
Your fuckin tolerance is annoying
You are annoying netflix
Let's block me
Black
Go to hell Netflix. This is rude to all he-man's fans.
If this is a follow up to the 80s cartoon why not even a mention of Adora?  By this time, The Secret of the Sword would have happened.
So promising. So disappointing. Thanks for ruining another good thing K.Smith, you evil s.o.a.b.
She-woman
How could Kevin Smith do this to us I was happy that he was making it because he always seemed like the kind of person to respect these series I know better now
Is there anything worse than Tik Tok? Yes of course, this Netflix series.
The animation is stunning. What a wasted opportunity. 😓
I'm glad I saw this, it saved me from wasting a lot of precious time watching this piece of crap. What a disappointment.
Cancelling netflix after this garbage
This show was good and people are just jumping on the negative band wagon for nothing. Silly sad pathetic negative trolls.
I just saw this and cancelled my netflix subscription immediately. Its been a while since a fictional product made me that angry (im looking at you, rise of the skywalker)
ohh thank god TEELA is here to save the day!!
Guys awaken and downvote that shit pls thx
All you had to do was follow Castlevania!!
Very disappointed. They could have stuck to the roots and this would have been great/profitable. This would have led to a She-Ra show, which has a female character. Both shows have a main female/male lead with mixed side characters. The old He-man was surrounded by female cast, so don't tell me it was too boyish you woke fools. My gosh.. we don't have to please everyone folks for everything.
Woke culture is a shit
This show is a literal trash can
What a complete letdown! The trailer was 100% misleading! Kevin Smith you should be ashamed of yourself! On par for a company like Netflix though! It’s called HEman For a reason!
Netfilx has killed he man. The series sucks . My childhood memories of the show have been ruined. They have the talent to ruin anything by making it look intelligent for no reason.  Post so many years the old version is 10000 times better. Pls netflix let it go.. u have ruined it.
This show ruined my childhood memories....lame
Cancelled my subscription since Keven Smith said his Netflix masters don't care about that kind of thing.
Best advert for the original ever
This is the worst show ever. They are failing to produce shows worth watching. Cancelling Netflix today.
SHE-MAN literally a fcking shit show
I thought it was great! Screw you negative nellys!
Get woke go broke. Thanks for saving me money and wasted time. I  have now cancelled my account and started reading books again. Cheers Netflix.
is this a series on He Man Character arc ....no no no no it's on "Teela .... Teela ki Jawani, I am so shaktishali for you , main kisike samajh main naa aayi "....
Thank you for punishing the hero of my childhood and letting him die. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. so shi...
What a load of crap. more woke bs
It's not He Man it's She man and Black lives matter combine HOLLYWOOD has ruined entertainment in last 5 years they are messing unnecessarily
If you're looking for purely feminist drivel, written by someone who absolutely hates everything about the original MoTU series, by all means watch this. Otherwise, save yourself the disappointment.
So wait a minute, He-Man & Skeletor are just playing cameos in this series? Then whats the point of even making this series.
He man used to be such a great roll modle for us growing up  The ude to stop just to teach how good something is and how to be a good person        Theres no roll modle like  He man SOMETHING THE KIDS NEED  aspeacily today with no smacking kids can choose the wright way to be         Ill admit he man made me a good man today through memories          I hope they get this      Sorry but thats true
I had lots of high hopes for this, but it was horrible! Was supposed to be a sequel to the 80s classic, but it was nothing like it. Just a bunch of hashed up crap
Yes because insulting the fanbase always works out....
She man mistress of the universe
I wasted my time watching this
NOTE:  All of the "thumbs up" for this video are from BEFORE the show was released.
Wish Heman was Marvel Comics. Fans deserve a good return
Let's see, the "woke" crowd has ruined Star Wars, Star Trek, Dr. Who, Sheera, He-Man, Captain Marvel, Terminator, the Olympics, women's sports, now, He-man!  Did everyone see Kevin Smith crying like a man child because the fans don't like the new series.  Pathetic.
Apparently, according to Kevin Smith, Netflix said that it doesn't matter if they offend fans, "because we have 270 million subscribers".
This trailer looked like the show would be good.  It wasn't.
The war on boys continues.
should call the show "Teela Queen of the Universe"
anyone feel they should have gotten someone differnt to do skeletors voice , cant help but picture "the joker" when he talks. there are better voice actors out there that would be way better than whats his name . way better. get a new skeletor voice netflix your "F" up the whole show even more than you have !  "ohhh look who we got to be skeletors voice: WHO CARES !! get a better voice !!!!!!!!!!
From now on... Dolph Lundgren will be know as the greatest He-Man ever
Should be called She-Man. Killed off the white male hero. Kevin Smith is a coward sellout for doing this to our childhood hero.
Watching this trailer after the first 5 episodes...I still don't feel like the marketing lied to me. This feels vague
It's seems like people will hate me for this. I grew in the 80s and love He-man, also I was young enough to love the live action version and still have fond memories of the film  even now even though it was  a commercial bomb.   I really enjoyed this series, mostly on the basis that there is (or was supposed to be) 2 more seasons coming where He-man will be more prominent. This IP has always been "masters of the universe" rather than He-man. Don't get me wrong He-man is definitely the draw, but why go straight in with the obvious whenb you can build a story.  Also if watch the documentary about the original series then it was clear She-ra did a lot better in numbers. Until I watched that documentary I didn't realise that the better characters and plot lines were from She-ra.  Do I want more He-man? Hell yeah! Do I mind watchin 6x20min episodes to get there? Not at all.  Just for background, I am mixed race and a mans man (borderline), who respects every walk of life but is a little fed up of feminization for the sake of it and over PC/cancel culture and everything that goes with it. This series was fine by me.  Our memory of "Masters" is just that, a memory, we would not be critiquing Ben 10 or Power rangers to the same standard.  So I say to you all, "Grow up and get over it!"  Side note: looking forward to more He-man in the next season
Such a bait. You made it look so good but it was a dumpster fire after the first episode
I really wonder what or who is the target group of this show (masters of woke verse) The former fans of the original serie would be a logical answer. However, obviously for good reasons those fans are pissed about the shows and according to Smith neither he himself or Netflix cares about that. So obviously, the little boys from decades ago like me are not the target group. I do not believe that this show has more than 2 or maybe 3 percent of female watchers, so they can't be the target group too... Apparently, the 21th century itself is the target group of this show. However, 21st century is not a person. Consequently, this show does not have any target group. Finnaly and ultimately that means that it has no right to exist at all.
Im watching the Previews#👍🏼 What U FOOLS so upset about? Looks DOPE to Me! And i was BORN N 1980!🤯😵😅 I HAVE THE POWER!
We got fooled.
More like lesbians of the universe
My guess is that he needed money for clerks 3... So they told him to make a woke He-Man and will cover a lot of the cost for clerks 3.... Kevin Smith destroyed his legacy... Nobody can stand the dude anymore and I don't trust the likes and dislikes of this video. They're being manipulated by YouTube
Way to completely ruin an epic and classic series..
What is this Netflix? If I want to see She-Man, I will watch Pornhub! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Let me just downvote first
What I don't get is people acting like Kevin Smith lied about what the show was going to be about. Most of what is said is by the Sorceress and Teela, and literally details the plot of the show. Magic is dying, TEELA is being asked to save magic, He-Man seems to be about to make a sacrifice "If I don't do this, everybody dies!", the sword He-Man uses to transform was split and they had thought it was destroyed, etc. Just looking at this trailer, it doesn't seem like Kevin Smith was deceptive at all, and all the people that made assumptions about the show are just being REALLY salty.
He Man dies in ep1, enjoy the Tela show. . .
I can't help but think that there would be nowhere near the visceral criticism of this show if not for the fact that the main character has boobs. Like if they did the exact same general plot, but the main character was Man-at-Arms. Some people would still complain about there not being enough screen time for He-Man, but they'd ultimately roll with it. Reading through the comments is all I need to see to confirm that.
0:12 dat sound editing lmao, so abrupt
Bring Evil Lyn back among the good guys. Please!🙏
This show is lame as shit. Kevin smith is a nerd who shouldve left this 80's crap dead in the past where it belongs. The show sucks
Lock how they massacred my boy
Is Neil Druckman directing alongside with Kevin? Cause this trailer bait thing sounds familiar...
Absolute garbage. Quit my Netflix a few days ago...
Tu puta inclusion me tiene hasta la verga jamas pondre neyflix me entiendes?
Seeing the trailer I was so excited to see the series, but I am very disappointed. Regrettable, it had so much potential.
You liberal loving bastards.
atleast netflix shera didnt make an other character the main protagonist
I hate you Kevin Smith!
Watched season 1 after my son called me. I can see why Kevin took this where he did, I hate it. But, I can't wait for season 2. Why would he do the 'same old, goodie show'? There will be many changes we won't like, but the graphics and story line are so out of the box, I am intrigued.
Netflix lost 430,000 subscribers in the US and Canada in the second quarter. Now say it again slower.
Netflix has the power to ruin everything.
I just hate this style of animation. And the voices the characters sound horrible.
Holy shlt ... the only evil that succesfully destroys He-Man is known to mankind as NETFLIX. Was raping my childhood hero and his realm not enough?! You just had to inject it with maximum woke poison?! There is a special place for Netflix people like you!
This series is like being invited to a Heavy Metal BBQ at a neighbor's house. You bring over a case of beer, expecting a good time.  And then you find out your neighbors are vegans, and all of the "meat" is just meat substitutes. And they don't have any seasonings or condiments. And the only music playing is WAP on an endless loop.  You reach for a beer, thinking you can get through this peacefully if you just get wasted. However, your beer is now missing. Your neighbors poured it all out while you weren't looking.
ITS AWESOME! Thank goodness it’s not a remake or a prequel. Feels like cartoon The Mandalorian with its own feels but still nostalgic.
Childhood memories❤
complete disaster
Thanks. Really appreciate you destroying one of my favorites.
The exact reason I never board any hype train. They almost always end like this. Like for the steam deck. I’m like “hell yeah that sounds awesome because ut I’m not giving my hopes up because it could be a total flop or actually good.” Don’t get too hyped, it’s a recipe for disaster.
Hola Vengo Del futuro, para avisarles que no vean esta serie de He-man sin He-man Teela es gay, con esteroides, marimacho que odia a los hombres y se convierte en She-man en la segunda parte XD
WTF? I thought i was watching She-ra, what a piece of Crap. Thanks Netflix for ruining My weekend and My entire Childhood.
I knew it was a bait and switch from the beginning.
This show is so bad, people aren't even downloading the torrent.
5 episodes in and I'm pretty interested where they take this series from here. Idk why people don't see that in all likelihood this storyline is going to head down a path where Adam becomes a hero in his own right without needing to rely on the power and Teela is gonna realize her magic power.   Like what kind of Oliver twist childhood did you guys all have that 5 episodes of cartoon could "ruin" it?
another series ruined by disgusting feminism behavior At least they show us the true face of this show from the first episode  And didn't make us waste time ...
Netflix tanto drama pará esto? porque matar un dibujo o serie de los 80?no lo querías hacer? No lo hagas? simple...
Episode 1 He man died.  Welp so did the show. I'm not even a He-Man fan but it was sooo boring.
I pirated this and still feel like I was ripped off.
I can't understand why people are angry because I'm not a fan - I think the original was a shit show, like nearly every TV show of the 80's. I couldn't fully watch the first episode because it bored me & I couldn't take it seriously.  But I would have liked to see this show get the Teen Titans Go treatment. A goofy version of Masters of the Universe for those who were *not* fans of the show. You'd have pissed off fans *anyway*, but it could have made something nice for the rest of the crowd.
‪Is it still a Factoid that King Greyskull is prince Adams’ Great-Great grandfather?‬
It was pretty good. It felt a bit short for the amount of story it had to tell. I would have liked to see more character development. It had great visuals and voice acting, and the plot was pretty interesting. I was afraid it would go for a way too safe adventure, but actually took the story in an interesting direction. The execution of said story was flawed, but never bad enough to feel frustrating. But it did leave me wishing for more after the six episodes we got, as if some of the characters weren't nearly explored enough, and as if this harrowing adventure was a breeze for our team of heroes to go though. Sure, they made some sacrifices, but we didn't get to know the characters who died very well before we lost them, giving their sacrifices less of an impact.  Pretty alright, room for improvement, but an over all positive experience, and I'm hoping the incels review bombing this thing doesn't rob us of a second season.
Netflix you are absolute scumbags.
SHE MAN BUUUUU
I was very excited about this show.... I'm honestly just disappointed.
Trash
Netflix/Kevin Smith ruins He-Man like Disney/Kathleen Kennedy ruined StarWars. Great work 🙄
The show shldve been called, she-man n the woke generation! This is trash!!!! Fck off!
They didn't lie. They just showed all the scenes including He-man. that's about it. Funny how my childhood in Anime from the 80's and 90's has been preserved in their remakes yet shows like He-Man are being trampled on. I know people don't like this comparison but... C'mon.
How did you do Castlevania oh so right, and He man oh so wrong.
Such disgrace... An INSULT to HE-MAN...
We need a FAN to remake this!
this was quite bad 🤦‍♂️ how can you mess this up so much?!
People do realize that “He Man” is a kids show….Right?     Right?😑
BAD SHOW
Absolute WOKE garbage!!!
Haven't seen this, but haven't liked or trusted Smith since he shilled for The Last Jedi. Dude's a joke.
In before Netflix disables/ scrubs comments about how atrocious this bait and switch was.
Took me half an episode to realize where this has headed. 💩💩💩
A lie.
I had never seen masters of the universe or any He-Man media but I was looking forward to watching what seemed to be a serious modern take on the franchise. Netflix ruined this just like the War for Cybertron trilogy
It’s all good goku would solo anyways
bait and switch. Not really a good He-Man story
Was it that bad?
To everyone affiliated with this: With all due respect, go screw yourself.
Best  series in animation since Superman, Batman and Spider-Man animation series of early 2000 .
The liberals got a hold of this lol this is trash
H E Y Y Y Y E E Y E E Y E
Complete garbage
So, hold on. People consider He-Man to be in every episode…because of flash backs? Since when have we ever counted that?  If a 10 year old girl asked me, “is He-Man in the 2nd episode?” I wouldn’t say “yes, yes he is.” After she watched the episode her follow up question would rightly be “I thought you said He-Man was in the episode?”  “Well, technically he was in the episode…he had screen time didn’t he?”
I heard this version is a pile of woke shit. I'm not even going to bother with it.
Netflix, the streaming service that promotes pedophilia and killing off your childhood icons.
Another show of turning gods into paper tigers, while inflating clowns to take their place.
Too bad the entire series wasn’t as good as the first trailer, even though the first trailer was an absolute lie lol. This is why I canceled my account with you guys the show was awful. It was the Tika shaves her head and becomes a Karen show. The fact that he man is actually barely in it is bad enough but you’ve actually ruined Tila as a character.
Another woke piece of crap
Anybody hating on this should go back and watch the thing they have all this nostalgia for - the original show was terrible, it was just a 30 minute commercial for action figures. The character design and world building was fun but there was nothing of substance to the original. I loved it too, and I am looking forward to a new conception of it with maybe a hint of a plot??
pure misleading trash
This is done by someone who hated he man. I hated who ever do this he man revival . Go to hell Kevin smith . You are full of crap
Awful decision made in the story line, he-man is the biggest and happyiest memory as a child watching cartoons, and the only reason you'll get more kids to watch this is from people like me getting our kids to watch this because we loved it, I can safely say I won't get my kids to watch it as there is no he-man in it, I'm hoping there is a good way for he-man to come back in the 2nd part as a lot of the characters were very true to the original and it could have been a great series had he-man been in it for godsake...like superman without superman being in it, ridiculous...and not to include the theme music in some form was also a bad idea, I know that it mite sound a bit cheesy now but it's still the things I remember most about my childhood programmes was the brilliant theme tunes or intro's.
Master's of wokeness. Done with Netflix for good. Thanks for the disappointment.
I've waited thirty years to see he-man come back and reign destruction upon his foes, instead we get a show about Teela and her feelings, this was such a giant disappointment.
It's really a shame, because I _was_ looking forward to this. The animation is beautiful, but putting a masterful coat of paint on a turd doesn't change the fact that it is a turd.
Well I haven't seen it yet, but all I hear is it's another sjw shitfest
When will Netflix apologize for this travesty? And remove the cancer of woke producers from their ranks?
Is Arnold Connan 💪😎👍
It's now considered "toxic" to want He-Man be the star of his own show
Dno, dno
💯📺🇺🇸🤜🤛🇺🇲📺💯 I am subscribe only for: Masters Of The Universe. Different, epic and at the moment the good end for the classic series.
I think the people who gave this a thumbs up didn't know about the WHOLE movie.  Nothing but a bunch of women complaining and saving HE MAN?!!! PATHETIC. Just like The Equalizer. NO!
They killed off ORKO 😭😭😭😭
Honestly the show itself isn't terrible but the trailer lying to everyone about what the show would really be sucks. I'd prefer the feminist agenda gets lost but unfortunately it seems we're stuck with it plaguing series that don't need it.
Talk about false advertising what a load of utter shite
I can’t believe I was fooled by the trailer 😞
I was hyped for this...
Upvotes and comments don’t align
The animation  is great but that's all there is to it the story is horrible  who is the writer someone please fire him.. This isn't he man.
Here's the thing, perhaps it would have been better for series one to be about He-Man. They could have reintroduced the characters to a new/old audience.  Make us care and love them again.  Then maybe in season 2 do what they wanted in season 1. Emotionally it would have a bigger impact for new viewers and  wouldn't upset so many older fans.
This is just about some lasbian surprised she’s not a blue haired land whale
I gotta give credit to Netflix, I mean kevin Smith, he just made the biggest bait in media history.
WOW! Seriously,  you fooked up one of my greatest childhood cartoons! FOOKIN SHIT SHOW!
not gonna watch it
its crap....dont bother watching it....
Nice white washed trailer.  The POC character, which played a major role, was replaced in this trailer with a white man.  One whom was nothing more than a plot device.  All this to get white men to watch a show which will trigger tf out of them.  You should be ashamed of yourselves Netflix.
No mamen lo matan en el primer episodio
I wonder if Tri-Klops sees Eternia through Rat's Eyes. Rat's Eyes. Rat's Eyes.
Watched  the 5 episodes  and thought  this isn't  what i saw in the trailer so i watched the trailer again. Yeah..all this happens in the first 10 minutes of the season. The trailer is the best part of the show.  I'm all for twists and as a kid you never got to see the bad guy win, the episodes had cheesy predictable  endings. This does nit and it's  not good. Plus no epic synthesized theme song. Yikes. Glad it was only 5 episodes  and not 23
Seriously though this was gonna be an epic and deeper story about He man but its just feminism... im actually tired of this
What a joke
Comments ellam padicha.. Intha series romba mosama irukum polayae..
Their lack of respect about our heros are sad. The industry destroyed Luke Skywalker, Seya, He-man, got the hate and don't understand that we'll enjoy more of this caracters, not less, not a relecture or another vision, just more.  They don't understand the love and the emotional memory.
Netflix you've outdone yourselves again with another disrespectful dumpster fire of a beloved franchise. I had such respect and love for Teela from the old shows, she was a fierce, intelligent, and compassionate warrior, the daughter of the Sorceress for crying out loud, You just didn't sideline He-Man, you killed a female character and made her into something worse.
Garbage!!!!!!! They are trying to ruin my childhood!!! Hell no!!!!!!
Ew           NOTHING CAN BEAT OLD HEYAEAYAEYAYYYAYEAHAY
Another terrible reboot.
it brings bacl old childhood memories but still miss the old soundtrack.
He-dead, don't waste your time.
Really wish this show would have lived up to the trailer. Hopefully part 2 will be more exciting and feature more of the characters that people watched for.
Netflix please don't tell me you made He-man gay😭😭😭, of all the characters
I liked it.....i have the pOooWWEEERRRRRRRR!!!
A disgrace. You took my favourite childhood show, piled it up and took a big fat dump on top of it.
The title of the series should be "masters of the universe: the revolt of teela". For some time they were watching a series of he-man, but they delivered something else.
I thought sword will only work with Adam 😀🙏
Wow this show Suuucked 👎
Mathemann
Like many people feel “tricked” by the new Netflix series "Masters of the Universe Revelation". Kevin Smith should have called the series "Teela -The Mistress Of The Universe" and be done with it. At least then we would all know what we would be in for.
I'm assuming those who are hating on this show are just mad that there isn't enough erotic He-Man footage for them to jerk off to.
Thanks to all the commenters who seem to have proven my gut feeling right. There was like zero chance they were gonna make a program in 2021 about a strong white man. Lets be honest this was promoted as HE MAN then released as Masters of the universe.  Also on a side note wasn't He-Man hench before he transformed originally?
This show is so bad that rotten tomatoes had to pause and filter audience scores.
A question for those authors and showrunners we see these days : How does removing female features from women and making them look as men achieve progressism or feminism ? Are you actually telling women that they'll only be free and strong when they'll get rid of their feminity, is that actually the message ? Please answer me, i really want to see you try bending reality. to make it fit your twisted logic here.
Another character assassination - thanks Netflix and Kevin Smith - think we should all cancel our subscriptions
The absolute gushing over Teela was near cringe.  I didn’t make it past the first episode.  When the main antagonist and protagonist get done dirty like that to make way for female ghostbusters 2.0, I’m over it.
At least Netflix won’t disappoint. It keeps turning these adaptations into garbage. Era melhor ter assistido ao filme do Pelé.
The only Way is ONE!
Adam / He-man has roughly 30 seconds of screen time in the trailer... about 1/4th of the trailer's length.  Teela is the first person shown in the trailer and the main plot of her going out to save magic is set up straight away.  There's not much of a bait-and-switch happening between the trailer and the show... just between folks' Brains and the show. The show's title doesn't have the word He-man in it like people are saying.  Y'all baited yourselves... you weren't baited.  Big difference.
Thank goodness the writers of MOTU didn’t create The Last Dance doc on the 90s Chicago Bulls.  It didn’t have Michael Jordan in the title.
To the people who are sooooooo upset. Get a life. How did you not know that it would be wonky...it's Kevin Smith after all. lol
The title of the movie doesn't say he man. Just noticed
I'm sooooo excited for this.....is what I would be saying if I was still a 6 year old.
You guys are incredible, you can ruin every franchise!
Can people stop crying about the show? It's different from the old one cause it's a different show, the lack of he-man in the title is intentional. If you want the oldcartoon just watch that lol.
Que verga! Me quedo con la serie de los 80' como siempre lo original siempre se destaca.
Netflix, you ruined my favorite childhood show. I will never forgive you.
Absolute trash.
Copy concept of Raya and the last dragon
It was a fantastic show, please make many more episodes! ❤️
This is why trust in mainstream media is at an all-time low.
just wondering if the people who are going all in on hate are just being mean because Kevin smith made that lord of the rings skit.
is Filmation's Ghostbusters up for a Sequel? filmation shall rise for this Netflix's Ghostbusters: Rise.
Why are you woke?
Watched the first episode. It’s not for me.  Pass.
Dumpster fire
I am disappointed Netflix.. seriously
Bruh i wanted to watch he man not some extra who needed character development in the entire series
The most gut wretching, vomit inducing, dream shattering, 1940s animated series ever created. The 2002 He-Man is back on my to watch list just so I can forget this abomination!
It's pretty good TV show my kids love it and I hope Netflix make a he man movie no cartoon
I was thinking that Teela and He-Man would be a pair in this series, each with half a sword, that way they could even explore Teela's feelings for He-Man. But they preferred to be ignorant and liars as usual
Kevin smith says Netflix doesn't care what we think! Netflix cancel part 2 and show him you do care!
Another Netflix pile of shit.
Otro producto desperdiciado por Netflix
He-man is in this trailer more than he is in the show
For all true fans On the Masters of the Universe Spoilers... this show Sucks   Come on Mattel ??? how could you have agreed to a show focused on Teela and Evil-lyn????
This Revelation is pure garbage!   What a bunch of hacks!
If you actually watch that trailer clearly implying a perspective shift even outright saying it and thought "uh it's gonna be about He Man", you clearly paid no attention. Also you can't do a trailer for that moment because it's actually so impactful cause I wasn't expecting and makes for 5 episodes of an incredible story.
Very disappointing
Soooo lemme get this straight.  You reboot a franchise because it has a built in audience, blatantly trick that audience into thinking they're getting what they want, deliver *absolute trash,* then call that audience (which was a built in factor to your success) toxic for pointing out how bad it was?    This is becoming the new formula for the entertainment industry.  Unsubscribe and go outside, folks.
He Man of the Future is better than this junk...
So another franchise ruined by the woke lot. You would think they would have learned from Ghostbusters or Star Wars or Terminator Dark Fate or The Last Of Us Part 2.
It's pure S**t
This trailer is fitting the final series completely.
Most of the people who claim they don't like this version easly forget that the 80's cartoon was created for one thing: selling toys, like 90% of the cartoons of that era! Plus the title is: "Masters of the Universe" masterS, plural and not "the adventures of He-Man"!  And, finally, don't bring up the "realisation", those 80's cartoon where cheap made and use tricks like the transformation scene to gain time in each episode!
This trailer sells it as a He-Man show. HE-MAN!!!!!! Goddam lies.
1:31 Nooooo look how they massacared my boy OH MY GOD GIVE SKELETOR HIS ICONIC VOICE BACK! If he doesnt have that papyrus from undertale voice I aint watching
I'm hoping and praying that something like this doesn't happen to the God of War franchise.
woke haircut. lol.
I for one, liked the show. Looking forward to Part 2. I am now 43 years old and He-Man the TV show was part of my childhood. If the Netflix show was just more of the same I cannot imagine it holding my interest for long.
I hate the art style.
Franchises destroyed by stupid Sequels so far: Star Wars Terminator Bad Boys The last of us Predetor Masters of the universe Whats the next big franchise they wann destroy with a stupid sequel? Ghostbusters? Indiana Jones? The Godfather?
Did you guys really think that Netflix is gonna make a show with a white heterosexual Cis-Man as main character with a name like "He-Man"?
This is the real cartoon that is really cartoon to watch
Woke trash, hero dies, bait-n-switch marketing - rip Netflix sub
Dude KEVIN SMITH DID THIS!!! How does he let this happen?!?!? So disappointed. I really hope they stop rebooting things.
Hey Netflix, you suck.
I have no idea about the show. I'm just here to see the drama.
Me conocian como Adam, principe de Gayskull. Hasta que un buen dia me meti la espada en el orto!  Y ahora me llaman I-van Y soy un trolazoooooooo!!!
This turned out to be absolute trash! Could have been something epic… instead they turned it into a sh!t show!
'1:17' 😆 I would stick to *𝗜𝗡𝗝𝗔𝗣𝗣* ^^ ⏪ that's where we get ours
You should be ashamed of yourself and Kevin Smith you are a LIAR
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
man.... people are so passionate to smash on this. While anyone prior to this generation of "reviewers" would just let it go, almost everyone who hates it, seems to want to destroy them because it didnt appeal to them and the "slow" pacing, I mean come on this start was meant to give you the idea this wars been going on for years, just let it play out least for one more season
I still loved this being the start. I just want to least see the second half. I mean come on. Just because you dont favor it for not appealing to millennials attitude of everything must be right for you, dont spend the next 5 months with all the time in the world to waste on picketing the show, cause I dont want it to go in the way of thundercats.  not like that
I thought HE MAN was gonna be black? WHAT HAPPENED?
Que paso con He Man no está!!!!! Ojalá la sería fuera buena como el trailer. Porque Tela es la protagonista?
My opinion 🤮🤢
In season 2 it’s He-Mangina.
What a joke...
It's too bad Kevin Smith sucked all the magic out of He-Man. I can't wait for part two, where they turn He-Man into She-Man 😆
I want a refund on the time I wasted watching this...made for the fans of what?! Twitter?! How did you manage to even make Mark Hamill sound bored? Incase you were thinking about it don't watch this show it's the last Jedi for he-man fans. A total betrayal of the characters and is clearly a set up for teela the all powerful and her new lover sherah to have a spinoff show none of the original fans will want to watch. Christ you could of made he-man have sex with skelitor and it would be more believable than what ever this is. Won't be holding my breath for any more 80s remakes from Netflix.
Netflix, you sneaky little rat🤐
Netflix you all just need to stop. You all are ruining these characters that we grew up loving. They always had a great moral of the story at the end of each episode on how to treat people and other good values. You all don’t know anything about the original He-Man. You all have made Teela into a whiny brat. It’s ridiculous that you picked a guy who is on video saying he hated he-man to come up with this garbage. Just stop if you can’t do better than this. You all are so out of touch it’s pathetic.
Screw this crap... Boycott
The old animation is better, they looked more realistic
Wer kommt von den Piets Mathemann?
A bull shit series
Just knowing this pissed off so many right wingers, haters and toxic fans makes me wanna watch it. And I'm not even a MOTU fan
Kevin Smith better not do any online shopping for a LOOOONG time...
I don't appreciate being lied to by creators. I canceled my subscription because of Kevin Smith lying about this show and his blatant disrespect for the fans.
Garbage! Total crap! Kevin Smith sucks!
Hard Pass
He Man After appearing:  Time to Go....
Will Any Episodes Come after ep5 ???
Its been 4 days,but my anger for being betrayed and cheated is not cooling off
Nope - Robot Chicken did the definitive version of He-Man
*Kevin lied, He-Man died.*
Ok sooo..She-ra gets some kiddos animation. And He-man gets all cgi? TF I’m sorry. No.
How can Kevin Smith and the makers of this show keep saying that this is a love letter to the fans of MOTU when they rebooted and retconed everything we loved about the show including the main character!!! This is such a betrayal to the fans!
They even tease us during the show with flashbacks of the cartoon we wanted with all the characters we love still alive and in the right costumes! So upsetting!
Only Netflix could turn even a He-Man show into a piece of crap
The show’s protagonist is Teela, not He-man. 5 episodes of Teela being the protagonist, and that’s gonna change in next 5 episodes? I didn’t even remember her.
And the wokeness has now reached and ruined He Man.  And the cartoon was better drawn in the 80s than this stop and go static shit.  We are doomed as a society.
Teela: Your son, my best friend, our champion just died, but what about MY feelings?
I just watched the first few episodes and I gotta say, its really fukin bad. I don't know who wrote this but they should be blacklisted permanently from writing anything. Its not even the SJW stuff that makes it bad, the writing is simply terrible and teela acts like an selfish sore loser in many cases, she wasn't like that in the original, her character is literally destroyed.
Amazing animation and terrible story, Netflix lie again. I am tired of this. I will cancel my subscription because yes is that bad.
Marxist propaganda. Enough of this.
My God this was terrible Kevin Smith told us it was a show all about He-Man the show we were all waiting for, for what over 30 years and this is the puke regurgitated garbage we get. Wow just wow!
Such a disappointment honestly why do they gotta ruin everything then somehow blame us for not liking it seriously? It's garbage
Excellent show, it's exactly what I expected from the continuation and update of a decades-old series. Very much looking forward to the second season.
Horrible.
🤔 is it me...  Does teela look like a stud. And adam looks sus......
Wait where's Teela?
Havent seen it yet is it worth a watch  or not , many thanks .
Feminism garbage.
Kevin Smith this sexist white men should step aside and let a woman write female characters
I haven't watched the original but this kne doesn't look bad why are people hating on it ?
Total Woke nonsense. I feel bad for hardcore MOTU fans. This is a DISGRACE!
when the girl looks like a man
Folks, it's just a cartoon you didn't like. Get over it.
That was awesome, dark, smart storytelling. WE LOVED IT! Thank you Kevin Smith from the Fans of the original show, who grew up.
liars
Shame it turned out to be woke turd. Looked great.
Netflix you are a murder
It's not that he is smaller although I would prefer hem to be as he was. He could be lets say 15 and Tilla 25. Its the whole face  sharp chin cheek bones etc.  Made him look like something else.  Personality wise I kinda liked him  he seamed wise and kind in comparison with Tillas dumb outbursts.  Fit for a king really.  But the agenda is clear.  I'm not delusional.   Action scenes were fantastic though.  When Skeletor casts the first fireball scraping the staff on the ground igniting the flame Reinhardt style  Teela evading manuvers and so on  I'm susspecting they used rotoscoping true to the original.
Imagine adora showing up
Kevin just cut his own throat.
Sounds like the plot of The NeverEnding story
the biggest lie of the Universe! better don't waste your time Just watch the 2002 He-Man, that is a good reboot
You're a f*ckin sellout KS!
Haha, Netflix is going to ruin every show they buy and put themselves out of business. Spoiler, He-Man dies and this show is about Teela.
Im taking the word Gay back. This was Gay.
Feminism ruining yet another show...
I thought it was pretty good 😂😂 thought the focus on Teela was interesting, and the animation really is superb. Orko and Evil-Lynn were personal highlights.
Well Hollywood just trashed another franchise
Well this comment section has gone to hell in a handbasket... Intriguing...
THIS SERIES IS A FRAUD AND I HOPE MATTEL DOESN'T SELL ANYTHING OF REVELATION ...
Perfect animation. But the storyline is lazy and just factory processed for the current theme of how stories have to be altered for woke.
Garbage shows for garbage people.
You know this is dead on arrival once you see what Teela's haircut, manly facial features, and body.
This could have been another Castlevania, a damn shame it isn't.
Wow, this trailer was a boldface lie.
Lies Lies Lies Kevin Smith sold his soul.
Deceptive editing at its finest.
Netflix it's officially you suck
Well I thought it was bloody brilliant!
"Yes, this looks awesome!" (hypes it up to all my kids and friends.)  Episode 1 Teela, "F**k You all, What about meeeeeee....(click)  (Sigh)
The show is called Masters of the Universe: Revelation, not He-Man., maybe that's bait and switch. But it's not a He-Man show it's a masters of the universe show.
This is  basically Teela's show!
Wait is this remake of the series ?
MATHEMANN
where's the show this trailer was for? because the one we got sure as sh*t wasn't it.
If they wanted a cartoon with a kickass female lead set in a world of barbarians, they could have just done She-Ra correctly. I liked Teela in the original but He-man was always the star. Does this mean that they aren't love interests for each other anymore? Also Adam wasn't a 90 lbs wuss like he's drawn here. Yikes.
This should be called: She-Man and the Masters of Lies.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Teela and the Teela's of the Teelaverse!
one again the meme proves real original (nostalgia), anime(fanservice), fan-made(homage), netflix adaption(leaking-cesspool)
Ah, now eventually you do plan to have He-Man in your, in your He-Man show, right?   Hello?
108k Likes but not a single positive comment?
Aww...So let me get this straight--no, nevermind. straight isn't the right word I'm looking for...You take away men's favourite childhood hero by killing him off to try and replace him with a nasty woman, making it all about herself and her girlfriend? How unoriginal! The animation is beautiful but not only can men have childhood heroes taken away, you have eye candy for women taken away too (don't take that seriously but it happens a LOT nowadays XD lol) in entertainment to please the lesbians? XD As a woman who doesn't give a crap about feminism, I'm very disappointed. I WANT ENTERTAINMENT. Boring!!! NEXT!---Also, I hope like hell Disney never remakes Gargoyles. I'm sick of really bad remakes of once great animated shows. XD
Zisch Zisch, ich bin die Ebenen-Spinne
What a horrible show this was. We were lied to. This is just another strong independent woman story with no He-Man.
я разочарован после просмотра и моё разочирование не имеет  придела (
Mathemann
Lying to your audience should be ashamed
Dear Netflix, please don't sue Mathemann. The educational system in Germany needs him.  Thank you for your attention.
Fire Kevin Smith, making Teela into the next He-Man isn’t what we want. Bring in She-ra if you want to make it more diverse.
He man has to sing his song
Love this show so much!
Isn't this made by the soy boy who cried at the guardians of the Galaxy trailer
wtf have you done.. man?! Netflix really had their heads fair up their own asses on this one
God, online fans are insufferable idiots with turds hanging out of their mouths. Can you imagine being this butt hurt over a KIDS SHOW?  I owned damn near every he man toy in he 80’s and this series has not negatively impacted my life one bit.  Maybe that’s because I’m a grown ass man who doesn’t see ‘wokeness’ everywhere he looks.
I thought part 1 was great. Dunno why people are so upset Teela is the lead character. Women exist too in Eternia 😂
just finished this woke piece shit ,  it was a bait and switch , im done with netflix once and for all on this one to many other options  that dont play to woke audience's
This was a total flop, destroyed from Woke feminist crap 💩
Gebt uns Mathemann zurück, ihr Penner!
Shame, could have been good
stop lgbti propaganda
Don't call the series He-Man if it's not about him.
Woke-Man! 😒
mathemann
Master of the universe dubbed in hindi please
Cancelled all my net flux accounts they just had to screw about with  the lore, they new the reaction, they knew what the fans wanted, but no they had to tear everything down, they couldn't even leave 3 friends alone now it's 4. They screwed and messed up THUNDERCATS, she ra and now he man, thing is I really enjoyed the first episode well 90% of it until the end where tee-ra throws a dicky fit because she was lied to Infront of the king and queen who just found out their son died, they gone woke so I hope they go broke, if every he man fan cancels maybe they will finally listen because it hurts their poker, I don't have much time left and I really wanted something good but no, by the time they try fix it, it will be too late,
Shame on Netflix, this show is a scam!
Kevin Smith is worse than Joeffrey Baratheon and Ramsay Bolton combined
He man trailer released Fans to netflix: TAKE OUR MONEY  After watching the first five episodes Fans to netflix: GIVE OUR MONEY BACK WITH INTEREST
They made He-Man's body too large so he seems like a monster.
But..what kind of shit is this???
It's He-ma'am
He man is my favourite growing up i still can watch he man but this new netflix version  Is not nowhere near the he man i know      Adams a skinny guy  Skellitors lost hes evil laugh  He man is not solid like i know  And skellitor is scrauny too    How could they deystroy he-man Im realy pissed off      The real makers of he man would laugh at this         They spent no time making this garenteed       Everything else seem like its going down hill too         Netflix is done with me    One more stunt like this ill going to can it and change companys
F*ck you Netflix and your progresist shit
Thank you Netflix for this show , only one thing ya forgot to put "He Man" in there.
YOU SIT ON A THRONE OF LIES
What an effing RIP off...netflix is a$$ for this
SHEMAAAAN!
What a shitshow. This thing is about Teela, and they have changed Teela into a masculinized, self-centered bitch. It's horrible and a slap in the face to fans of the franchise.
This was total trash!!!
You have to like it, or you're sexist.
I had to comeback just to dislike this trailer. This version sucked sooooo much!
Garbage
You Trolled us Netflix great going you assholes
this is garabage.
Never seen a trailer lie so badly
Hindi main upload karo
Y'all the name of the fricking show is He-man and honestly specking watch the old one it's better.
Wonder how part 2 is going to go Will withhold judgement until then
False advertisement, shame on you Netflix
Netflix just ruined all of he-man disastrous you will, after watching this, I have to re watched he-man year 2000 series, for mind peace, what a shame netflix, and kevin what a shame you give
Kevin Smith has officially become more believable as a fictional government blacklist level hacker in a 2007 Die Hard movie than even slightly being an actual fan of He-Man
Hero defeating a purely generic baddy is really cliched now. Must say the writer's did a good thing by nerfing up Skeletor and focusing more on the lives of other secondary characters. Stop quipping guys and appreciate the showmakers for their creativity.
Liars.
way to go with the fake likes arseholes. Check the comments and the audience score in rotten tomatoes. Why does everything have to be about social justice for you Fucktards in Netflix? This is the last straw I am cancelling my subscription morons.
What a shit show  🤣 🤣 🤣
Che cagata
He-man gets more screen time in this trailer than the actual cartoon literally titled HE-MAN!
Another case of "they didn't do their research" and "they don't know what the people want".
he man dies and is replaced by a  mary sue named  teela, she is the new "she-man"
Samurai Jack revival was better than this..
Is Masters of the Universe really about he-man or a new sort of new universe thingy.... Are they really want to create their own universe?
Just come here to dislike, you guys ruined another series
This trailer is all of He Man screentime
I think you truly did justice to the serie, not with a simple remake but evolving it, become it better. I have to say it REALLY GOD JOB. I can't wait for the 2° season
Prince Madam
What a piece of shit.
Wow man one of the best clickbaits of all time man they even had the people that animated castlevania
Garbage ! kevin Smith and Netflix are liars.
Don’t watch. We have been lied to. Took a show from my childhood and destroyed it. It made me sick. Could not watch past first episode.
Say what you guys want. I enjoy it, I never grew up watching He-man so i blind watching. But I know some basic of he-man and watching it. I know I'm going get hate but I think of it an anime remake, the animation look familiar like Seis manos and Blood of Zeus, even it doesn't have the anime the animation feel like it
Its crap i want back my money
Es BASURA quiero mi dinero
🤮👎🤮👎🤮👎🤮👎🤮👎🤮👎
Well am not watching it for you have killed he man
Please do not watch this crap. I repeat pls do not watch this crap.
He-Woke
Amazing Trailer, but a huge turd of a series, what a disappointment. FYI Netflix, MOTU is about He-Man, maybe you should have made him the main character.
Looks like someone copied CD Projekt’s homework
So let me preface this with the fact that I hate Netflix and I hope the business dies. Now that's out of the way, I have been seeing a lot of hate against Kevin Smith for his version of He-Man. When I was a kid I would lose my mind if I missed an episode and I have been hoping for a reboot that didn't suck my whole adult life. This reboot could have done without the woke BS that was snuck into it and the multicultural nonsense. Thankfully Kevin Smith didn't turn this into an LGBTQ ad campaign and I appreciate that tremendously. The line "no glove, no love" was unnecessary but I can forgive it. All in all I enjoyed the show and I don't see why KS has gotten so much hate. I hope he makes more of them, just less woke. I can't stand much more woke BS, seriously I'm over the P.C. garbage.
Trash! Where is He-Man
jeez, how misleading
Season 2 will be better
They-Them and the Wokers of the Universe: Reparations
On piracy websites, more people are downloading last year's episodes of woke batwoman than this dumpster fire.  If fact, Cats the motion picture, which some argue is the worst movie of all time is more popular than this woke garbage.  When pirates don't even want something for free, you know its really really bad.  Expect to lose even more subscriptions Netflix.
This trailer had me really hyped, but the show was disappointing. I'm not very excited about the next installment.
Me before: I’m so excited Me after: ....I’m not even mad...I really just want to...cry...I guess...why’d they do this... why do they keep doing this....😭
Bros I'm a huge He-Man fan and grew up on it and I don't have a clue who Teela is🤨
Not the right tone. Guessing this was made by people who are younger and didnt grow up with the show. You absolutely CAN NOT have a he-man trailer without him holding up his sword saying “BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL!!!”  Garbage.
Yet another part of my childhood destroyed.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
So that was a fkn lie
What a scam this is. Way to destroy ANOTHER good series.
Hamill does great villain voices but I think he got Hordak and Skeletor mixed up, Skeletor on here sounds like Hordak.
Remember children: Whenever you meet a feminist, beat the shit out of it!
Wokeflix strikes again.  Never underestimate the power of stupidity when it comes to running a streaming service.  It's almost as if they WANT to lose subscribers.  Either that, or they think 99% of their paying customers are all Biden-worshipping, soy-swilling, blue-haired, feminist left-wing SJW ideologues.
Pathetic
He man: heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyyey a said hey!!!!!!!
First they came for Ghostbusters and I said nothing. Then they came for Luke Skywalker and I kept quiet. Doing this to He-Man is TOO MUCH for any red blooded geek to bear! CANCELLING NETFLIX! To arms my geek brothers….
Oh no so many snowflake beta-males cry xD i love it xD
A terrible show made by terrible human beings.
JUST BE HONEST AND CALL THE SHOW “TEELA: THE FORCE IS FEMALE”!!! Then everyone will not feel lied too.
Imagine a new Wonder Women cartoon where she is clowned and killed in episode one and Batman rolls in saves everyone. The screams of misogyny would be everywhere!
Total garbage!!! Another fan favourite destroyed. Why even remake it when he-man wasn't even in it. Why not name it adventures of teela and her girlfriend!!!!
Hey Netflix, according to Kevin Smith you don’t care about negative opinions or negative reviews about your shows. You know Disney made the same mistake with Star Wars.
Awww look at all the widdle butthurts, trying to make out this is a nostalgia thing and not a sexist thing. It's called "Masters of the Universe", not "He-Man"... why the frick is any of this a surprise to anyone? Smash that patriarchy Buffy. Smash it good.
Well in contrast to most comments, i actually liked the damn thing.
Biggest case of false advertising
Total garbage remake.  Should be in the trash
If you honestly thought that you could watch a cartoon about a masculine blonde haired straight white guy hero that wouldn't immediately be killed off and replaced by a lesbian in 2021, you are hopelessly naive. Where have you been
Awesome...could you maybe reboot Thundar ?? Yes ..No ??
Lol I'm just here to say never be excited especially when it comes from a woke company just Outsource Your Entertainment Koreans got great dramas Chinese have some great dramas Japan have anime have fun!
ok, who insisted this new he-man had to be woke?
Looks amazing.. i like how they've recreated the 80s shimmering light energy effects from the original
Another victim of woke on crack. what absolute garbahe. so shera and heman are now designed for girls apparently. kev smith must have been high on alien weed when he decided this disaster. Heman lost his own show, its Teela and motu, hilarious. yep they were trippin when they decided this calamity.  no one should waste even a microsecond of their life on this nonsense
Cersei?
I'm just watching this for skeletor
So far it's an absolute garbage. Kevin said He-Man will be back in 2nd season....maybe that changes my opinion...
I rather watch dolph lundgren's he-man for nostalgic reasons than this crap- at least it had frank langella in it who was a great skeletor
Damn heman looks cool, i hope we get to see him a lot
Someone call this "disrespectful" of the fans but you all forget a simple thing. He-Man was a STUPID cartoon for kids and exclusively made for selling toys. Without a real story, without a real reason to exist. Skeletor was a joke and all episodes terribly trivial. But i've loved it, as a kid so it was probably ok that time.  Now all the fans grow-up, i'm near to the mid-age and, AS A FAN, i've loved the Netflix continuation of the story. If they had kept the '80 format i'm sure everyone would have said: "Thanks Netflix for another stupid cartoon!".  So, those who have loved the original He-Man and the original feeling when they was kids CANNOT really say those bad things now that they are 40-50 yo! As they said, this is for the fans, not for the new kids. ---------------------- Anyway, said that, i've also to say what my dislikes are.  First, the musics. The original one was giving a sense of EPICNESS... those used here are a bit pathetic!!!!! 😓  Second, the animations. I really think you've missed some frames during combats. Honestly, i don't think the cost would have gone up that much for 15 more frames!!!!!!!!!!! 😓 Really hope that in the next 5 episodes you will do better than this. --------------------------------- In conclusion i can say it is never banal and never predictable and give you many answers... like good show should be! 🤗 For me, as a FAN, it is a 4 on 5 stars.
Spoilers ahead so I'm warning you:       Basically this is another Hollywood y chromosome removing feminization of our favourite shows where he man was killed as was Skeletor in the first episode and replaced by f****** women. Kevin Smith hold your head in shame.
IT'S A TRAP!!!
Why are there articles defending this nee narrative?!? This wokeness is ruining everything. What a liability. At least change the title of the show.
I thought sword is like Thor's hammer only works with Adam.
Did anyone notice He-man's transformation in the first episode ? They clearly showed his butt. Why did they change the cleavage in teela's original costume and decide to add a nude/rainbow he-man butt to the transformation ?!!!? They left the nude butt out of the trailer ......
Heroes Work Shop,  so far I can tell you this if you have not see this series, you are saving hours from your live.  it’s not for anyone who actually enjoyed He-man
just to put things in comparison, if this was She-Ra and they pulled this mess, feminists would be marching on Netflix right now with pitchforks
Holy carp these reactions... o.0
Biggest crap ever. They destroyed it.
So who wants to bet that Andra (Teela’s race-bent maybe-sorta-possibly girlfriend) is actually a descendent of King Greyskull (who was also race-bent for this series) and will take up the He-Man mantle while Teela becomes the new Sorceress and they save the day and ride off into the sunset together (either with a kiss to show they ARE in fact a couple or still kept ambiguous)?
Fail. Do something original subscribed .
I waited for so long for five episodes seriously yowwww smbh
Imagine they redid She-Ra and they trashed her and made that dude side side kick the hero and center of story. It would be NON STOP screaming about misogyny and calls to cancel the show and all creators!
Masters of the Universe : She-Man smashes the patriarchy ("your childhood memories") The Last Jedi version of the Masters of the Universe ? Masters of the Universe : Revelation part 2 : Crossfit body Teela's coming out and the feminist "fact" that she always was better, smarter, stronger and more a hero than He-Man. "Teela, your greatest fear ...pretending to be ordinary when you know deep down that you are so much more" literally taken from Part 1 is a bit the introvert narcissist life motto.  Masters of the Universe : Revelation part 3 title : Teela, the only worthy protector of Eternia and new wielder of the Sword of Grayskull and new Sorceress of Grayskull and also new Queen of Eternia and she is always right.  What an amazing woman everybody especially men can look up to. The modern day feminist Mary Sue dogma was fully "unexpected" thank you Kevin Smith for such "great" writing and totally "unexpected" character development in part 1.
What a bunch of woke garbage - but what can you expect coming out of Netflix 🤣
Who is this show for?! He-Man is belittled for a butch Teela to take center stage. The title is HE-MAN!!! Get woke go broke. What you have done is so PC safe and lazy and is for a non existent audience.
gayflix
Powers be divided bye thyn own hand .Kevin smith 2021
What a SHlT!... You ruined it...
lame
i was super excited when i saw the trailer but it's such a disappointment. i love female lead trust me but this is just not fun. at least if you wanna make it like this don't trick people into thinking that Heman is the center of the show.
The biggest lie and bad writed history, He-Man died and Teela was the victim??? a Crying weak main character.... I really would write a best series with Teela as main character anf being more honest with fans.
C Bait La serie Un saludo a Pixar nos Rechazo
Run of the mill impotent incel fanboy comment section. No real critique, just whining and lamenting a childhood lost
RIP HE-MAN HELLO WO-MAN.
False info about this shit🤮🤮
DID YOU HAVE TO GO WOKE?.  GODDAMMIT.  Talk about click bait
Utter rubbish.
Has none of the heart of the old one
Whats with these directors recking our child hood memories.
Saying it now: As a Thundercats fan please do not remake Thundercats for the sake of Thundercats lol
Please boycott this woke garbage.
Damn this show sucks
I was completely deceived by this trailer.
This was a good show . No WOKe garbage
the main character of the toys the “comics” and original tv show was he man and the master of the universe he man is the main character and in the trailer they lied to us showing he man and the series is a total crap they should call te la o she man
Wasn't going to watch it but since it's being attacked as being "Woke" I'm in. Not going back to sleep. Sorry.
Absolute garbage
Netflix: Lets make heman. Also Netflix: Kills   Heman first episode. replaces him with woman on steroids.
To save you all time, let's just say the show's REAL title should be She-Man and the Mistress of the Universe :( Now, if you still like to watch this, go ahead...
She-Man ... who will play "they" on the big screen? Better get a stack of juice ready to get jacked
judging by the comments it's "they-man" now XD
The animation in this is really beautiful, too bad they ruined it. This could have been a major hit if it was done right.
Watched this to give it a fair shake and benefit of the doubt. Needless  to say another down voted show on Netflix. Kevin Smith is a blatant liar  and won't be receiving anymore of my money. Mattel has lost another  He-Man fan and won't be receiving any more of my money either. Rectify  This dumpster Fire and perhaps I'll change my mind. Until then, I'll  stick to the old stuff and things created by real fans.
Can you imagine the horror at how this show is being received at Mattel . They probably were expecting a boost in the sale of merchandise but I have a funny feeling interest in it will drop off a cliff now .
Filmation He-Man series wins.
HE Man dies in twice and the LGBTQ  squad wins thee day. that was the whole plot.
Kevin Smith,you sad little man...
No
it's a shame that the essence of the original series has been completely lost!  what progre garbage is this remake
Wow hot garbage from scumsmith
Netflix I wanted to let y’all know y’all wasted y’all time with these one
Do not watch this!
very very disappointing show
The original movie is way better than this
The trailer looks good the show really sucks it's nothing but 5  episodes of some chick complaining about how nobody told her any secrets get over it this is not what people wanna see
An absolute piece of animated garbage !!!
This cartoon is absolute crap,makes you wonder who this series is trying to appease?
You fooled me into watching this garbage, Netflix.
Please change the title to “teela, the angry princess, mistress of the universe, saver of everything “ (rated plain stupid).  Or better “Killing He-Man” that too is fine.
Another example how the WOKE and Feminist agenda poisons everything!!!
Merci pour cette merde
you could write your woke story in anyway you like no matter what. You  didn't have to ruin a classic for it. Seriously it is mind blowing how  brain-dead idiots get to make decisions in a billion dollar corp on a  product management level. Really wanna vomit from this political  correctness and woke shit cant take it anymore. Switching to amazon  prime for couple months for a change. If you really want to inspire  oppressed people with role models, that's now how you do it you  illiterate morons. History is full of these inspirational people if your  empty brain cant be invested on creating your own heros. YIKES.
He man with out He man, this is piece of the shit 💣💩🤮
It tooks Netflix a merely one episode to turn a 40 years old memory of a strong, selfless and pure hearted character like Teela into a progressive, cringey, edgy and querulous karen.
This is not Masters of the Universe, and Kevin Smith should be ashamed of himself.
the thumbnail is sooo misleading
I watched the 1stvand 2nd ep..... I stopped there, ruined my childhood
Very nicely done, but that had nothing to do with He-Man anymore. Just turn the original main character into a secondary character, what's that. Nothing against strong female characters, but the series should have been called something else. Anyone who expected He-Man was pretty disappointed here.
Wow Netflix is relying heavily on the like bots. This show was total shit.
This show was HORRIBLE!
*Curb Your Enthusiasm Theme*
It’s in the Title. It does not say He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Revelation.  It says Masters of the universe: Revelation. Ain’t nothing “Man” about this show so don’t get p*seed off. Sit back and watch. Or watch something else.
If they wanted a strong female to lead the story, they should have done She-Ra instead. The series was awful for the fact that we are not seeing He-Man at all. The story is really a mess. They've shown King Grayskull but for what? For air time? Moss man has a better narrative. It is a mess, really a mess.
Lmao! It's absolutely horrible
I am through the 4th episode and I don't know what everyone is crying about.i am enjoying the show so far
Piece... of... trash !!!!!
Wow was this a slap in the face to fans. Netflix just hates anything male at this point.
SheMa'am XD
അസ്ഥികൂടൻ 🙂
wokefest masters of the universe
Another woke remake.
You guys fu@&ing suck so...................................... bad you ruined He man but didn't ruin She ra. Why???????????? Why do you need to push being gay? You know it's okay if you're gay but a lot of us are not and the more you keep ruining shows, is the quickest way to lose all of your customers.  He man was for little boys not girls . That's what She ra is but you chose the latter. So with each step of trying to force your sexuality on me I will no longer subscribe for your services and will tell others not to renew their memberships again either. You're discussing and I hope you pay for being sh!++y people.  You discusse me and many others over this trash. And no I'm good with people being gay , I just don't think it should be crammed down straight peoples  throats. Just saying
You might as well go ahead and cancel the rest of this show if Kevin simp is involved. Wouldn't it be nice if someone would put the fans first before money
Ok cool, now do Dino Riders.  Get some real retro cool shit going on
Bait and switch.   This is the Teela show.  Netflix should be ashamed. Kevin Smith should be ashamed.
Saw the first episode. Go no further. Turned into feminist bs. If it was made for feminists then they can go watch it. It will fail like batwoman and all those rest of the try hard shit that has come out recently. ✌ Their money loss. Not mine
I wanted to watch He-Man not this garbage.  Kevin Smith has destroyed his reputation.  I will never believe a word Kevin Smith says again. How does a company screw things up this bad. Kevin Smith = Ryan Johnson
Man..this trailer looked good, but the show is awfull. I would be even ok with the decision they did in first episode, if the script was actually good. If I looked at it as a amateur writer I want to hang myself. The main characters are bad - no strong good motivation, no dilema leading to transformation, nothing. This leads to dumb dialogs and annoying main character. Shame on you writers, you didnt even try to do a good job. Maybe decisions of people "above" ruin it and Im unjustly blaiming writers for it, Idont know. Anyways.. waste of time and insult of audiences intelect.
Es una basura
A more appropriate title would be: Hymen : Lamest of the Universe. I wonder if Mattel will sue the morons who have made that show for ruining its franchise.
Another fail. Continue
Teela              Woke star                 Of The               Universe
Absolute woke shit! I’ve waited 30 something years for this and he’s dead before it starts!!!
netflix killed the show
The thing is, regardless of people review bombing coz they killed off He-Man (I'm pissed off too) or praising their new take on the story, Netflix is still gonna make money on this.
Good if you want a he-man show without he -man
Oh dang... Mark Hamill and his generic bad guy voice. Why couldn't they get a voice actor with talent like Frank Welker to voice skellator.
Wow.... It took only one episode to introduce yet another strong, independent woman. LOL. Attitude - check, haircut - check, being super hyper awesome in everything - check.  Im only guessing - Teela will find the 'SWORD' and she will be next 'He-man'.... wait - I mean She-Man.  ANd that`s the purpose of this serie. Have to admit - all your traliers were sending different vibes. ....and of course  white, oppresing male holding power of the universe in this age? Not on your watch Netflix. One question - why is Teela  white? Not Asian or Black? you becoming sloppy Netflix. But to be a little more serious -  Im honestly starting to think about going for Disney+.
No Skeletor laugh.?
This is how franchise is destroyed. Well done netflix. Goodbye.
STOP IT GUYS JUST STOP IT leave kevin alone hes doing us a favour by doing this I like where hes taking the plot and he didnt take he-man out altogether it called Masters of the Universe Revelation not just he-man this show involves everybody EVERYBODY YOU STUPID IDIOTS BUT NO INSTEAD OF ENJOYING IT LIKE I DO AND SOME PEOPLE YOU GUYS JUST LIKE TO WHINE AND COMPLAIN LIKE A BUNCH OF BABIES I mean you guys like the 2002 he-man right? so why not like this one oh heres an idea why dont you guys come up was a better he-man show oh wait YOU CANT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARENT FILM CREATORS OR ANIME CREATORS YOU ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELFS if this show ends up being cancelled because of you then the people on the internet are a bunch of morons incapable of adapting or accepting to new things and thats sad VERY SAD my advice to you all KEEP A OPEN MIND IDIOTS.
don't watch this trash he-man get's killed off it's nothing but woke garbage, jay and silent bob are both pos's... kevin the soy boy smith you alway's sucked in all your film's go retire.
Adam dies. TEELA and some strong women, and weak men of the universe. Ha ha ha. Subverted your....oh, where did you go ?
People get mad about the most ridiculous things anymore 😂🤦‍♂️
I thought Teela was a woman in Heman.   So she a guy now?  Another cartoon to never watch.  Let me guess there is no Heman either, unless he there for the comic relief.
This had to have been the most deceitful trailer in trailer history.
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
I think this may be the Last of Us part 2 of 2021
Netflix screwed my childhood memories by making this series full of wokism .. 🤬🤬😡😡
The ending of the first episode and the beginning of the second were pretty much enough for me to see all of the warnings signals about this suspicious show. He-Man, along with so many others good old shows, have undergone Netflixication. All of these pathetic post-modernist themes; Again, a rebellion lesbian anti-males female protagonist (Teela), an unnecessary, unbalanced abundance  of black characters, "technology is better than Magic" stuff (= progressive and leftist ideas VS the good, old  conservative ways) is just make us all sick. No wonders why it got only 30% positive rate from the audiences.
Canceling Netflix now, pure GARBAGE.
Why is anybody still paying for Netflix at this point, all they do is take your favorite franchises and destroy them with woke propaganda.
Spoiler...    Omfg Orko is dead the best character of all, Adam is back but what the hell is going on?  . How will it go on. I love it
He-man series without He-Man. False advertising.
Ending: Prince Adam is dead and Skeletor has the sword and the powers of grey skull. So yes, it was an awful season 1.
Is this the consensus new SheRa over new HeMan?
Rip
Also F you Kevin Smith!
Teela master of the universe. F*** you Netflix for lying and pretending this was a show about He-Man F you right in the poops!
I can understand why so many people are upset but remember it's only been 5 episodes, don't lose your shit if they have a Teela arc and then move onto a He-Man arc etc etc, if you all try bomb the show after 5 episodes then there won't be a season 2, 3, 4, 5 etc to have enough episodes to show everything everyone wants to see (He-Man "crushing skulls" is what I want to see :P) so take a chill pill and give them a chance to actually tell a story.
I watched it and I have to say I am disappointed. I like the animation, skeletor was brilliant I also liked some elements of the story but this is not he- man. Too much woke for me should of made she-ra and made a decent he-man
I hate this woke agenda please stop ruining everything
What is this garbage?? Who is this actually written for? It’s not for original fans of the show! It’s not for children, otherwise you wouldn’t have Evil-Lyn saying ‘oh bullocks’ in episode 4! Expected more from Kevin Smith!!
Do everyone a favor and don't upload part 2
What came first, was it the figurines or the show?
So they killed He-Man in the first episode, gave a lesbian haircut to Tila and make her the protagonist. Wow. Look, there's a little of Master of the Universe in your agenda, Netflix...
If they want to bring something back, how about give the fans what they want, not a PC message no one wants.
KEVIN SMITH IS A LYING PIECE OF SHIT.  He was never a He Man fan.  He is a complete Hollywood shill.  He jumped on Clownfish and owes them a huge damn apology.  This show has destroyed the canon of He Man.  This is now the teela show and he has ruined that character too.  Kevin Smith why don't you just F off you tosser.
Worst show ever!
Loved it. Actually I was blown away. Can't wait for part II.
just binged the series - LOVED IT! The voice acting (esp Lena Headey, SMG, and Mark Hamil), music was epic, style was on point; loved the story and how out there it was in terms of magic, technology.  Can't wait for part two!
It's nice and all but were is he-man?
Im suprised it dosen't have more dislikes. Since no he man fan likes the show.
Nice job ruining this too. Kevin stinks.
And another icon dies on the SJW altar.
Next season will be ‘She-male’ and the masters of the woke ness
I must admit I was upset at first. I felt robbed. I stuck through it though. Once I start a series I find it very hard to leave. I have to see it through.   For me the ending felt kind of predictable. How can you do a MOTU without the two staple characters? I was not expecting that last little twist though. They actually went there.   Much like most of you I grew up with a bit of He Man. But I also loved Transformers. I remembered when they killed Optimus and changed Megatron to Galvatron, and killed a bunch of Autobots and Starscream that was dark and I grew to love the movie in time.  This is what this show feels like. I'm keeping an open mind. Besides it's only the beginning nit the end.  Do you want a Heman and MOTU that reminds you of the old? Or do you want something new? Something that seems to be a little bit darker? If you want the old find a DVD or your old vhs tapes and live in the past.
where is the original BGM ?
Ну и дерьмище....
One of the most offensive thing other than killing he man is Kevin Smith having Mark hamil do jokers voice for skeletor.
Complete trash.  Considering all you had to do was make a show about a muscle bound Prince riding a green Tiger fighting a skeleton on front of a skull Castle, this is an embarrassing failure.
So He-Man dies at the end of the 1st episode and the main character will be a female,  I hope this is not true,  also the WOKE got involved and there going to use this to explain to children about CRT, the division of 2 parties,  and on and on , not watching this . I grew up watching He-Man,  but this people just destroyed it.
Die Helden meiner Kindheit geopfert für eure politische Korrektheit!!! He-Man ist Nebensache und die Story dreht sich um die lesbische Teela mit ihrer schwarzen Partnerin. FY!!!
Was really looking forward to this but just so disappointing to see that identity politics is as creative as it gets nowadays with reboots
No mames Netflix
Dude! This is a feminist animation! It has barely anything to do with He-Man...
Screw you, Netflix, you ruined this show.
Art is incredible. I wonder how it would look if traditionally animated. The old art of He-man and Shera looks better on some levels . Especially some designs
The show is horrible, don't watch it.  Cancel Netflix!
Get woke, go broke. Why can't you fkn understand it???? WE DON'T CARE!
Lmao the name of this show should be:  *Teela stays mad because Adam didn't tell her his little secret REVELATIONS*  what a good bait 💀
Kevin Smith sucks
What a crap show 💩
Boo!!!
Loved the first episode, also loved that Teela got some spotlight and story progression, I love how they have added Stakes and a solid plot, goals, struggles and things to overcome, Also Loved the twists and turns, episode 5 had me cheering and then shocked and devastated on the cliffhanger,   Can't wait for the next 5 episodes, However I will say this, though I really did enjoy Teela allot, I NEED my He-Man Fix, He-Man is why I loved this show when I was younger, and He-Man is why I'm watching this show now... Don't Let us Down...
The fact that you need to deceive audiences to watch woke material means you already knew that audiences don't want to watch woke crap
wait 30 years of my life to see a new release, I am a very fan of this character. and they just turned it into nothing. What happened to the character was not respectful at all. You could expand the universe without having to do what they did.
*Bait and switch go brrrrrrrrrrr*
Netflix even Changed the Description of this Video From "He-Man returns to Face a New Threat w his Pals" To Teela and her Squad. What an Absolute Joke.
Omfg did I get backstabbed
If Kevin Smith wanted to do what he did, why then create a He-Man movie and not just make a Shera princess of power movie??
They should have called it ......Teela and the Masters of the Universe.   Feminist trash. don't waste your time watching it
Soo many facial expressions from a skull with no face lol
You had us with the first trailer then you lost us with this one
Only one he-man vs skeleton fight and it took a couple of minutes, the only reason masters of the universe exist is to watch he-man and skeletor fight, the show sucks
Ooof loving the cringe chuds squeeling out in the comments "mah cartoon what have yuh SJW done!? waaaaaaahhhh!" Cry some more :)
*shows a ton of Adam and fan fav characters in the trailer*  *Me:* wow this looks like a better version of the 2000s reboot *Show:* so that was a fuckin lie
This is garbage
Textbook bait and switch.
This is not He-Man. It's woke agenda BS that ruins the He-man series. Teela has obviously been altered to be exactly like Beauregard Lionett from critical role. WTF isn't She-Ra the female counterpart to the show. Why can't we have any more strong male leads. Instead the only male's are a mostly absent father(man-at-arms), Beastman (who act's like Evil Lyn's slave), and a male robot that does what he's told. What a sad joke.
If you want to ruin a franchise then create your own ip and ruin that. How creatively bankrupt are these people that they don’t have their own ideas.
Essa série é uma desgraça total
These people cant come up with an original idea to save their life. Imagine having millions and millions of dollars and no imagination.     When you can't be original..be Kevin Smith.
More like HE-WOMAN
7 minutes, that's all it took to ruin a franchise. That's gotta be a record of some kind.
As long as it pays tribute to the OG series... are there cheesy messages in the end about lessons learned? I hope so. 🙏
I posted my fan review of MotUR on RottenTomatoes, and the next day I am unable to see/edit my review, and when I go to the fan reviews it says there are none.   This explains why the fan review score is improving -- they are scrubbing negative reviews.
Trashcan series
The He-man transformation( the first and only one) is probably the best thing about this show, I'm gonna give this show the new star wars trilogy treatment, and consider this non canon and just move on, oh and I'm a Kevin Smith fan.... but go #@#$ yourself Kevin.
As soon as I saw Kevin Smith was involved, I knew it would suck, and it does! 🤮
.... and that's another beloved classic executed by firing squad by woke Hollywood
Sorry Harvey but it’s crowed control time with this one
"Netflix, Netflix!" "Yes, papa?" "Deleting dislikes?" "No, papa!"
Show devolved to more woke wandering. He man's dead and the show is about Women
maybe they should have put the entire season at once and not split it in two short parts, animation is amazing and so are the fight scenes but the overall story so far seems meh.
Tell as part 2
Aaaaand garbage made by a garbage person.. I'd love to see this done with actual he-man fans making it.. its like Alexander on steroids..
Absolute woke shite.
Who the fuch still cares about he man
More remake crap.
Boring
i hope it was worth the money you got for your soul kevin smith
ALL HAIL  Tila and the females and social Justice Warriors of the universe
All I have to say is: TAKE BACK YOUR THUMBS UP.
JUNK
As expected from netflix, way to ruin a beloved franchise. bait and switch garbage.
It's crap. It's a shame. And No Kevin Smith...im not a robot or a bigot. This is my genuine opinion of your pandering and unfaithful bastardized show.
*Kevin Smith is lair and Smith is now basically everything he said he wanted to fight against in Hollywood.* 🤦🏽‍♂️
Forced diversity as usual, netflix. I don't need this sh*t anymore. Give us relatable, likable female characters in new shows, without wrecking old Franchises just for your screwed agenda...
This show is an absolute disaster in every way... From plot to voice acting its an embarrassment, and affront to my childhood memories.
Its really bad. The animation is gorgeous, but this is the Michael Bay Transformers for He Man. Just Horrible.
Uhh... I thought this was He-Man. They tricked us. We don’t want to see a wannabe She-Ra as the lead.
Why is this even called Masters of the Universe? He-Man got disrespected so heavily. So much for wanting to even make a respectful homage to the original show. This remind me of ReBoot: The Guardian Code, which barely had anything to do with the show it was a supposed sequel to. Granted, that is even worse than this new Masters of the Universe, but it's safe to say that the dude in charge of this project has made me extremely weary of any future projects that claim to be respectful to the original Masters of the Universe. That is what the guy has done to me.
dolph lundgren's HE-MAN still better than SHE-TEELA man series
Dang...... Streets telling me this trailer is greatest bait of all time
Could you not just make a decent Cartoon? You really had to vomit all this shit upon us ?
Killing off He-Man/Prince Adam at the ending of season 1 was a kick in the nuts to all die hard fans of the franchise in the 80's. I understand you wanna give it more female presence, but killing He-Man is not the answer (This is like killing off Superman), why not bring his twin sister Adora (She-Ra) into the fold for next season to resurrect him.
First episode was good until the end.. Second episode i was wondering where he-man was so i skimmed through into episode three before i gave up...  It sucked.. Awesome animation tho
He-Man getting removed from his own show actually is the greatest metaphor for modern IP revivals.
I thought the first episode was pretty enjoyable. Granted, I don't really have that much attatchment to He-Man himself (I always thought he was the blandest part of the franchise), but I liked it alright.
Demon be gone, go back to your shadow! - Orko
This is actual dialogue from this 💩show “He-man didn’t hurt me, adam. You did. And couldn’t even scream at you for it” Teela to adam after his death  “I died 😑” Adam “Yeah and the rest of us had to live with it” reeeela👺
no wonder that i cancelled the subscription of netflix
I'm Disappointed Netflix and I will tell you precisely why so you hopefully won't make the same mistakes as Everyone Else seems to be doing. So please, pay attention.  Absolutely ALL of the iconic franchises have been Tanking because of the Purposeful Vandalism that has been done to them. You Should be at least Somewhat aware of the criticisms leveled at Lucasfilm for the absolute Misandry led Mismanagement of it Legacy IP'S from the Majority of the fanbase which has resulted in severely impacted Revenue streams across Movies, TV, Comics and Videogames. The Complaints, Concerns, Worries and Fears for a Decade now have All been confirmed in all Resulting Products released. The Single Largest Problem with the Misandrist Agenda that has been at work IS the Demonization of Established Positive Adult Rolemodels Male and Female. These characters and franchises Do NOT Represent the Ists and Isms that are so Popular and Trendy today. These are NOT Confederate Statues that Actually Represent the Dark side of American history.  These have Always Been POSITIVE ADULT ROLEMODELS for the fans for Generations.  What we all watched with Horror and Disgust at the sheer Indignant, Demeaning and Emasculating Treatment of Luke Skywalker along with every other male character in the Sequels.  He-Man and She-Ra were Combo GOLD when it came to teaching kids through episode Storytelling and Simple Explanations at the end of each show that they, along with the Other shows of the same era, Reinforced the Earlier Years LESSONS from the Goodly and Progressive Likes of Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street that WITHOUT Politicizing Anything, just Presenting the Simplicity of Basic Right and Wrong, Taught Generations of Children, Me included, to LOOK UPON Our Fellow Himan Beings who were DIFFERENT FROM US without DOUBT or FEAR and a KIND HEART and EYES and to TREAT Everyone as EQUALS, with DIGNITY and RESPECT.  The Baby Boomers, those Flower Children of the 60's FOUND a Way to Make the World a Better Place by Planting those Oh so Positive and Progressive seeds in our minds and We NEVER Forget them. We were TAUGHT by these POSITIVE Adult Male and Female Rolemodels and we just Accepted People for Who they Are as compared to the Prejudices we Never Liked as Kids and CHOSE NOT to Carry them Forward.  And Today we have PRIDE Parades all over the world.  We of Generation X aren't Witless Old Nerds or Toxic Fans. We just KNOW these Characters and IP's INSTINCTUALLY.  We KNOW the Recipe,how it's supposed to TASTE. How its SUPPOSED to FEEL.  What you presented us with here is Anathema to the Progressive Lessons Taught to Us by Your BETTERS. You have Turned what Was Totally Inclusive and Diverse into something Fractured, Disjointed, Oblivious and Ignorant of the Inherent Value of the Positive Adult Rolemodels of MOTU. You EMASCULATED Prince Adam. You TOOK AWAY his VOICE. You Took Away his IDENTITY.  You Took Away his AUTONOMY. You Took Away his AGENCY. All of these things were an INHERENT and IMPORTANT Aspect of the Original show during an age where INCOME DISPARITY had grown to be Enough of a Problem where Both Parents in any given family unit would have to take on Full Time Employment Reducing the amount of Quality Family Time amd Interactions and Designed ALL of the 80's shows To REINFORCE That GAP. He-Man and She-Ra ARE Obviously WHITE characters,  but you CANNOT Earn ANY Brownie Points for Demonizing RACIALLY and then Demeaning and Emasculating them and Replacing Them with SUBPAR Substitutions and Not Face a BACKLASH. We are NOT Toxic Fans. We ARE Fans and That's it. You've made a SUBSTANDARD Product because You DON'T UNDERSTAND the characters and stories and franchises in your Portfolios and honestly....you Probably Don't CARE Enough to Learn. He-Man and She-Ra ARE both Positive Adult WHITE ROLEMODELS to Generations of Fans of ALL RACIAL BACKGROUNDS from ALL OVER THE WORLD. And WE ALL Percieve the SAME Basic Inherent Value of Having POSITIVE WHITE ROLEMODELS who Do NOT and NEVER HAVE Represented the ILLS that have Been the HOLLOW Argument behind and For these ACTS of CULTURAL and ART VANDALISM.  And MOTU is Just now the LATEST and One of the Most Egregious Example of these Legacy IP's being in the WRONG HANDS. Or at the Very Least...being Checkmark Lisrmted by WITLESS SUITS who Couldn't Fight or THINK their way out of a Wet Paper Bag. You DEGENERATES...that's Exactly what you are. You've REGRESSED 50+ YEARS OF PROGRESS in Less Than 10...and YOU wanna Blame US?! Oh no no no. Without Respect, We REJECT.  You Feckless Cowards.
You shit the bed on this one
This show was absolute garbage. If it was about Teela it should’ve had Teela in the title. And if it had Teela in the title I wouldn’t have watched it jus the same as I avoided shera for being trash. And this trailer was super misleading.
Ah, more woke garbage for the miserable weirdos who spend their entire existences virtue signaling on twitter.
This show sucks
It is a PROGRE-FEMINAZI  PEACE OF 💩💩💩💩!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
So disappointed in this show. And tired of this woke garbage. Also, terrible casting of Mark Hamill as Skeletor. Smh
You do not need to gay up a kids cartoon . Smith is trash
I'm guessing all the thumbs-up was just for this preview, before the actual thing was shown.. I'm guessing many of those would not be there people saw the whole thing
Absolute trash. False advertising. This trailer has nothing to do with the show. The story is horrendous. Inconsistent, pointless, boring, filled with politics to the brink. The main character is annoying. Full of token characters. The animation is lacking. I could count the frames at certain points, and they weren't more than 2 or 3. The voice acting and sounds were good. Couple epic moments put in.
OMG, this sucked. I can't believe what I just watched I was so excited and optimistic. Graphics excetera. Then come the end.. Remind me of the feeling I had going into the last Ghostbusters movie and how I felt by the time and end it. OMG. Can't believe this
He-Man, the Most Powerfull Man in the Universe, get's killed two times...
The biggest lie in history.
He-Man and Skeletor die first episode. It's all about Teela, her girlfriend and Evil-Lyn palling around kicking men's asses, killing some. That's it.  All the men die and it's just the gals and the evil men who aren't even the bad guys, just in the way. Utter trash... except the art and the musical score. Those deserve top marks.
It's not about He-Man ...this is she man 's tale...Teela is the hero...Mark Hamil plays  joker, I mean skeletor
Bruh, why they made man he-man gay. Also every time Skeletor was talk I couldn’t unsee the Joker, great voice actor but I feel they should have gotten some one else.
Man can’t wait to see my favorite character Orko
Going back to watch the cartoon network reboot, to erase this out of mind
All the wait for this piece of shit presentation of the greatest Hero of all time
When these companies swore to make inclusion and diversity their number one goal, what did you guys think they were talking about? Lol
Why why do you have to spoil everything for us? Leave our super heros alone.
You shitty fucks even changed the race of greyskull.
This show is Woke cultist garbage attacking yet another childhood icon. Mattel knew. So, screw you Hasbro. You won't get another dime from us. Our kids will have toys from your competitors. Canceled Netflix too. Its all Woke garbage now. Kevin Smith is a piece of ferret crap.
Kevin Smith has done for Masters of the Universe what Walter Simmonson did for Marvel's Mighty Thor comics in the 80's.
People complained about this not being a show about He-Man, but stupid people don't understand that the series isn't called: He-Man, it's called : Masters of the Universe.... Wich means that the guy was nvr the main antagonist, it places each character in the story as a main character. I just watched episode 1 and 2,and before you start bitching, I grew up watching the original show, even then some episodes didn't even show Adam the entire episode turning into He-man. I like the animation and fast pasted action so far, also like the story plot till now. Ofc this can change since I'm just done with the second episode. But people bitch and moan to much in my opinion. Be glad they are bringing our childhood cartoons back to life. Cheers.
another cool thing from way back ruined...
What’s going on?
Netflix where careers go to die. I mean, does hollywood really not understand WHY 80s had a resurgence? WHy fans still revisit 80s properties and jump at the chance to see a sequel? THE WHITE MALE WARIORS and CHARACTERS. because we arent getting that from new stuff. If you wanted to make a female led show, make she ra, stop destroying the characters we love, Or DONT TOUCH IT. Leave it dead. Because all you hacks are doing, is making people done. You want to lose 80% of subscribers? Keep this crap up.
I have the powerrrrrrreeerrrrrrrrrrrr ✨😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kevin Smith went full on The Last Jedi… killed the main character twice to comply to identity politics. I don’t get it.
You ruined He-Man
Wow I just listened to the new theme music & I just noticed that the old theme said only 3 others knew of Prince Adams secret & didn’t mention Cringer! Lol
I haven’t watched it yet, but now idk 🤷‍♂️
Well this sucked
Oh look. Its SHE-Man:Revelations. Where all the male characters ( He-Man/Prince Adam/Orko) die off , retire or are completely worthless sniveling panty waist wimps. Its all up to the Females with their square cut jaws, broad shoulders and BIG beefy muscles to save the universe from the big baddies now. The only thing stopping them is the fear of being TOO powerful. Which they get over pretty quickly. Kev Kev TOTALY didn’t lie to the fans about it NOT being this way.
I love it. Douch bags want to bitch and the series isn't even done yet. Impatient much?? You're the same kind of person that needs everything right now. You probably think sex is a race to see who can finish first.
It’s a piece of shit.  Can boys have anything? Can a little boy have a hero? No.
He-Man thank God have another chance to see it again, there so many animations we missed like Captain planet, Double Dragon i hope Netflix can bring back those series
It's MA'AM, HE MA'AM!!
suck it, kevin smith
This show is absolute trash, and Kevin Smith is a straight up liar. Very strange situation all around.
Hahahhahhahahahah woke culture is out on a rampage. Another one bites the dust…
True Fans: Wow a extension of the story!  "Hipsters": Um it's hip to hate it... So um yeah I'm totally gonna not like this.
skeletors voice can´t be other than original
There I was all excited to see He man but surprise it was the Teela show......Damn Netflix for ruining my nostalgia..... You suck......
Not a fan at all, Ruined a childhood classic.
Don't waste your Time  on watching this. just Thumbs down it. Such a waste of time space on the screen. the DIRTY DANCING PARODY OF HE-MAN  and SKELETOR IS MUCH BETTER  Than this GARBAGE!
Apparently the show is shit
Anyways watch she ra
he-she-man
This show is garbage, all the rumors were true! Avoid at all costs!
Don’t bother watching it. He-man is no where to be seen. Should be rename as shewoman.
F
Trash
in the 80s the toys that have been successful were created. now the same success should be repeated by creating a video game with "gacha" mechanics in full EPIC SEVEN style (including the important animations).
Kevin obviously wants to fail   . Heard he’s getting the same work done that Katyn Jenner had.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Non binary- man lol
How to turn diamond back into coal..good job Netflix. Don't waste your time with  this trash. I was looking forward to it.
Evil can not create it can only infect and destroy. These sad sad saaaad bundles of sticks.
Go woke, go broke.
Jesus Christ, Netflix ... we all knew that you only work with activists and SJWs, but this shame of a show is pathetic even by your standards. Your goal is to secretly reshape society and manipulate your viewers, isn't it? Then I would do it a little more skillfully and at least pretend to be offering good entertainment. You should be ashamed, really.
He Ma'am
HE-MAN without HE-MAN... Was it too hard to add the protagonist and not make a show about sidekicks!!???
Trash, trash already!
They lied...
Incredibly disappointed. I remember someone saying "Wait till the release, and modern feminism buttfucks it." Dude called it. This is sheman. NOT He-Man.
The problem is the name. They could have tried to tell a original story but that is risky. This show isn't about He-man, its about restoring magic, it should have been called something else but its easier to advertise it as He-man. I don't hate the show, its very beautiful to look at, lots of colors and fluid animation, but its just not what is advertised, and that's my biggest problem.  As for the "wokeness". I thought Invincible was kinda "woke" and it was still a awesome show so.....42
After watching the episodes I can honestly say that this is PURE GARBAGE.
This trailer is a perfect example of MISLEADING customers/consumers. It is a predatory practice and a felony. There is no He-Man in this series as the main character. There is She-Maam aka Teela with token haircut and a token black love interest. Written by sjw filth, no wonder it's on netflix (we all remember Cuties and how you guys promoted that monstrosity for groomers).
hello i got paid to say this was amazing,  oh wow...  i totally wanted the dude to get off'ed
He dies in first episode
remakes and reboot are so predicable. Many of us called it a bait and switch show.
Trailer is good, but the series is ultra woke. 👎
i really thought people were over reacting, but they are not. this show is sadly not about he man..... why does hollywood insist on ruining nostalgia?
woke rubbish
I gave up after 3 episodes. It's terrible!
Just another "hey lets make it about the female supportive character, instead of the actual hero, that people wish to see, so that we can show the world how 'woke' we are.", version of something that used to be great. 🤷‍♂️
trash
No no no no omg....
thanks for the effort but so far I don't like the new series,  everything was good until heman disappeared, you guys made this about teela, and as and old fan for the original series I think this was disrespect, it remind it me to the live action movie it stinks
That Adam...  Lol
Horrible! They should of called it, “Teela and The Masters of the Universe”. Basically they remove He-Man and Skeletor (the two best characters) and Teela goes searching for the sword to bring them back to life. So 4 episodes of Teela. Lame!
Woke-man
Killed he-man not once but twice its the teela show now enjoy your sjw agenda 😉
Love it! Different,but good,actually it's even better than the original! Can't wait for season 2
all the "likes" will turn around the moment people watch more than 10 mins of this STEAMING PILE OF SHIIIIIITTTEEEE.  Dear "Hollyweird" are you just trolling us now?  Just take things that a beloved and established and destroy them?  Because that's all you've been doing for a few years now.  How can anyone feel proud of this stuff?
just watched first episode omg its sooo shit.
Well, that didn't take long.  Fans are already pissed off that the writing is following the status quo of progressive ideology.  Not to mention lying about He-Man's involvement in the series.
ahí te va un resumen el hombre mas fuerte del universo muere sacrificándose por todos, empieza un era de decadencia y se necesitan nuevos héroes entonces su amiga guerrera, su amigo con muchos artefactos para pelear y su amigo robot van en búsqueda de esa arma a la cual hay que hacerle un proceso de transformación para restaurar la paz, en el camino se encuentran al rey de los mares que al principio no quiere ayudarlos pero después cambia de opinión, entran a un lugar con conocimientos y tecnología que desconocen  pero a a pesar de las dificultades logran reunirse de nuevo con su amigo mas fuerte y vuelve a la vida y aunque al principio dudaba termina cambiando de opinión en un momento luego de una gran batalla el personaje mas cómico del grupo termina salvándolos y haciéndonos llorar y al final terminan dejándonos con el primer vistazo a uno de los villanos mas poderosos vistos,  en resumen buena película, exacto estoy hablando de la LIGA DE LA JUSTICIA 😎
Why make two identical she ra shows about the same thing that men suck and lesbian is the way to go xD
So bogus, He-Man himself was only in one episode. Teela isnt half bad, but the show is called "He-Man". I wanted to see He-Man goes ape shit on Skeletor and his army.
Load of shit.
Kevin screwed up big time. I mean if you wanted a female hero, you already got one. SHE-RA !!!! Do she-ra, not defecate on he-man.
I watch it and Disappointed with the series. Might as well called it The Teela Show. The first 10minutes was promising and kind of hoping they would tell an Origin storyline. But after 10mins, I already guess where the series is heading and already lost my interest.
Another sjw trash...
This show is trash!!!! Seems like a waste of great voice talent!!!!!!!!!!
Netflix you've outdone yourselves again with another disrespectful dumpster fire of a beloved franchise. Disgusting adaptation of He Man.
They have spoiled it so bad..if they want to make a short hair girl with the feminism on steroid type of series nobody is stopping you. Call it She man, do it ... y do have to spoiled this series.
The animation is pretty neat but what a terrible story arc. Sad
Lol there's no way the like/dislike is accurate
So I watched this garbage and He-man and Skeletor are hardly in it.
IS THERE NOTHING SACRED? NOTHING THAT CAN BE KEPT AWAY FROM THE WOKE SHIT THESE DAYS? MUST EVERY CHILDHOOD MEMORY BE POLLUTED BY "STRONG" LESBIAN CHARACTERS?
Another toxic move and clickbait, done deliberately to discriminate, disrespect and destroy, instead of creating something new in a healthy way
What the flying f....?
Yet another iconic male character destroyed by SJW woke nonsense.
Absolutely trash
What a giant pile of shit...
I can taste the political agenda.
some things should just be left alone.. remember your childhood for all the right reasons
Cartoon with most unrealistic male shape now will be with tons of misandry and gynocentry and sexist malehating remarks... Holly shit.
what a piece of crap show, it completely crapped on the original.  good story writing once again took a back seat to feminism and diversity.
I guess Netflix is going to treat this show like She-ra   I don't mind all female roles.. But this is a  He-man show ,, I just might have cancel soon ....
This is what happens when you give out awards for participation.
LIES.
Episode 1? How about Episode Last? Thanks Kevin for ruining my childhood memory, ya big fat shill.
Какое же это наебалово!
Welp.
Let's make a captain Marvel sequel and have spiderman as the main protagonist.
Get woke go broke.
talk about Click bait. trailer WTF Netflix!!??
F*** you Netflix for killing HE MAN and turning my childhood show in to a LGBT show. Will not watch the ending of your show and will not watch the second part.
They need to rename netflix to female flicks.
now you know why his name isnt on the title
Watched all 5 episodes, couldn't help myself, but I do regret it. This show is bad, but not because it's 'too woke' or it suffers from 'feminism'. It's bad cause there were A LOT of good elements and they were wasted. The pace is rushed, the tone of the show and art style is so different that it makes anyone vaguely acquainted with show feel wrong footed and unsettled. It has  it's humorous moments, He-Man cracks his awful puns, and they are cheesy goodness, but then there's a bunch of very strange decisions taken with the story. For one He-Man isn't the focus, and it's weird, because the show never made me feel ok with that. I liked that Adam was made more distinct to He-Man so it wasn't just a man disguising himself as another man by stripping. But he was pretty quickly sidelined out of the story. And i kept watching hoping he'd come back. I like Teela! She would have made a great protagonist of her own show. She would probably have been an awesome supporting character too, they could have started off like that, and then had her go off to establish her own show. Like Angel off Buffy. Unfortunately Teela and the other female characters can't even shine properly because all of their character moments are rushed and lack impact. There was just too much going on and no plateaus  for the audience to breath. The series keeps introducing questions, but is incredibly slow with any satisfying answers, and constantly on the move. Some characters die, and there's a definite attempt for a proper send off, but it just isn't earned. It just falls flat and has very little impact. I mean, I cry at the drop of a hat, but I didn't cry once during any of the episodes.  And then when it's time for there to *be* actual character moments, actual bonding, the show just doesn't do it well. You feel flickers of what could be, but nothing else. The show really does feel like it is purely about Teela and while i like her, and wouldn't particularly mind that much, I am unable to enjoy that because this is started off about Adam and I don't like the writers using him the way they do. The series feels wrong and unpleasantly manipulative despite how likeable I find the main cast.  Also the queerbaiting. Why? Just why?
So this trailer had the only good scenes in it. Feel free to skip the show now, you'll be happier.
I totally get why people don't like a boring hero who has no weaknesses and no character growth, and the traditional He-Man very much fits this description. What I don't get is why Smith gives us exactly the same boring hero without weaknesses (but being pissed a couple of people didn't tell her a secret to protect her, their nation and the whole universe) and character growth and thinks it's okay now because she's female. This show is what happens when you have a great idea but you're too lazy to develop it. Not great.
I really liked it. I will wait for part 2 cause they have a lot to fix and if they don't I am going to be very angry.
nobody gonna ever trust netflix or kevin smith again after this one
Good job, this is great, the hee-man we all wanted. Trailer very faithful to the series too. 10/10
more like She-Man.....bunch of shite.
HYEAHYEAHYEAHYEAYEAH
I'm not a fan of how they've treated He-Man in this series. The show itself wasn't terrible I guess. I hope he makes a comeback in part two. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a terrible choice to voice Teela.
Kevin Smith is a liar.
😾🚧☣🚧🤡💀🚧🖤🥀👻
Trash
Feminist shit show...
It suck!!! Between inclusion and constantly canceled series, I'm thinking of unsubscribing from Netflix.
It’s lit !!!! They need to make a motion picture of this it’ll be so cool
Haters gonna hate, but I for one actually enjoyed this a lot, as someone who didn't grow up with the original 80's show. I just saw the 5 episodes of season 1 and I thought it was amazing. So haters, say what you want. I don't care.
Nice bait and switch @kevin smith
*"jokes on you i'm into that sh**"*
First you ruin She-Ra by destroying the "male gaze."  Now you ruin He-Man by making him an afterthought in his own show.  What's next Netflix, you going to ruin Thunder Cats next? Oh yeah, Cartoon Network bet you to it. 😂
Just finished watching. That was NOT the show this trailer promised - making fun of He-Man, killing Orko and pushing an extremely annoying, whiny and plain ugly Teela.  Yeah, I guess there is stuff that is pretty cool like Skeletor (not enough though...) but all in all the show lacks balance and is clearly NOT made for the old-school fans. Not sure what to think of it to be honest...
This is one of the worst things anyone has ever done to a part of my childhood.  I watched the whole thing and you turned Teela from a strong, courageous, selfless guardian of the crown into a pampered, entitled, petty, selfish asshole.  Good job, Netflix.  Good job.
More like Teela and the masters of the universe. I mean, wth is wrong with these people? Isn't there a Shera series already?
A show without He-mand and Skeletor that shows the effect of their absence on Eternia could be interesting. Focusing more on the wealth of characters that have been under used and under developed all these years. Sadly this show pretty much solely focuses on Teela who is written to be quite unlikable and self centered. The only draw of this series is nice animation and nostalgia baiting by featuring obscure characters and vehicles for a few seconds here and there in the background. Such wasted potential.
I was really hyped for the show and surprised that in 2021 someone (a netflix from all!!) dared to do a whole show about super white, super masculine, super blond manly man and they didn't change anyone from the original cast into the black non-binary lesbian marxist... And they killed two main characters in the 1st episode xD And gave us a show about "super" adventures of two super strong, super witty, super empowered lesbians, one of which is white (strange!!) but so manly and masculine as it gets to not be a disgusting man but still an empowered non-binary person leaning on the women side. They even gave her a breast plate to make her jugs from the 1st episode totally flat :D She's also a super martial artist with every weapon. The second one is of course a black lesbian and an super inteligent engeneer and inventor. She's more feminine side of the couple so they left her boobies toobies be.  So cool and original take... yuck.
There is no He-Man in that He-Man series up from episode one. Just two super empowered lesbians, one of which is super masculine and the second one super black.
You people are THE WORST! You ruin EVERYTHING you touch!
Kevin Smith is A Charlatan and A Liar!!! He is No Fan At All!! Kevin Smith is Utter Bilge!!!
Masterpiece of Sh*t. Thank you SJW.
Are we getting a TV series about Barbie with a show about Ken shooting guns, drinking beer and watching football next?
Do not watch this garbage.
aged like milk
Absolute shit, don’t bother woke as F**k
He-man? more like He-Woman
Absolute trash . " Adam was a Teenager who didn't get out of his house much ?" If you wanna criticize then bash the writers of He-man from 80's why the character itself?!! Nobody says in movies that 'Wonder man' likes to get tied up and spanked referring to her 30's comics.
This is gonna go the  batwoman way very soon. I dont get it, why do you guys try to push your stupid propaganda down others throat. U guys can be gay or lesbian or what ever I dont care. Create new shows for ur idealogies and stop remaking great shows. This kinda movies and shows makes people distance themselves from u guys more and none will even bother understanding ur side of the story. anyway this isnt made for me.
HEY EVERYNE DOWN VOTE THIS PAGE WHEN YOU VISIT. THE SHOW SUCKED. LETS SHOW NETFLIX THEY SCREWED UP!
Thank you netflix and kevin smith for ruining a show that was so important for many of us. U guys dont even have guts to showcase this as a woke teela show. U needed a man's legacy i.e Heman's to jumpstart ur woke propoganda garbage. Even if I pirate this crap show no one will watch it and I will make sure none of my friends watch this crap show.
When I was growing up watching the original series I learned that men and women were equal and slavery was bad... and that was just one episode!! This was one of the most progressive shows to ever come out of the 80's with every female character being portrayed as someone of authority but for some reason it was in need of a PC makeover. If the woke movement really wants people to start supporting their cause then perhaps they should stop latching on to established franchises and come up with authentic stories featuring female leads.
Get woke.. Make trash..
Not ever IP needs to reflect the bs politics taking place in the USA. This is fantasy with an established lore. No need to inject our social issues.  This trend is destroying our entertainment industry and creating more division. Create new properties and include whatever politics you want and let's see how successful it is. Instead these cowards hijack franchises and mislead the fandom that's kept them relevant.
It was a lie
Loved the show ❤️ I guess Ive seen online  so many negative reviews and angry drama queen fan boys that I started watching the show with low expectations. Im glad I did.   I ended up enjoying a lot the show. Binged all episodes, can’t wait for part 2 😊
Garbage.
I hope the writer goes straight up broke. Get woke, go broke. That's the rules.
Biggest bait and switch job ever.   Holy god was I duped.
*It's not **_He man_** it's HE MAAM*
We’re going to do a bio-pic about Kevin Smith and  the filming of Clerks. It will feature some guy who saw the movie once and is struggling with an unfaithful wife and his own latent desires for his bowling team captain, Bob. Kevin Smith won’t actually be featured except for in the advertising   Sound like a good Kevin Smith movie?
Shit series 0/5. Don’t let your kids watch this.
He ma'am
This trailer makes a lot more sense now that the show is out. She has more lines and more scenes. Wow.
I have just back here to downvote this garbage. You ruin EVERYTHING, please cancel this as my netflix account was...
Never ever reboot or make a sequel to established series again. Please. I will pretend this does not exist, and the show lived on the 2002 reboot. Learn from that on how not to offend fans.
What an absolute joke!! Kevin Smith needs to be thrown out of Hollywood. He-Man is definitely a franchise I grew up with along with Voltron and Thundercats. Still til this day I still think they are some of the best cartoons ever made. Even the remake in 2000 was pretty good and Netflix's Voltron was pretty good. But this Masters of the Universe Revelations is nothing but garbage 🗑I'm embarrassed and the people that made this show should be thrown and exiled from Hollywood and go work for McDonald's but then again they are not capable of cooking a cheeseburger. I am watching the Original He-Man right now as I am typing and it's soooooo much better. The 80's will always have the power of Greyskull!! Lol
Smh
Pure trash 🗑
Netflix is a woke joke these days. So glad I cancelled my membership.
The Netflix trailer with the song "Holding out for a Hero" was as awesome.
This show is sh!t...sorry :/
Woke POS
If you were a fan of the original series growing up don't watch this. Classic bait and switch
This trailer was veeeeeery misleading. Showing mostly the episode that doesn't suck and hiding most of the actual show.
Guys its just the intro thats focused on teela, coz absbhdhd and ajjdjdjdjdj but its gonna be about he-man jist wait for the next episodes. If you've watched the 5th ep you'd know.
There is no he man in this
*No strong male characters and He-Man is secondary? 😂 So they marketed He-Man (Prince Adam) but Kevin Smith et al pulled the old bait and switch routine? Just why?! Similar to Finn being marketed as the lead-protagonist with Anakin's Lightsaber only to find out it's Rey! Imagine if Finn - a former Stormtrooper - went to search for Luke to teach him the ways of the Force to eventually stop Snoke. It would have been an utter delight had Finn been the main protagonist instead of a comic-relief whilst suffering in the script at the expense for Rey's development ~ Subverting expectations didn't work for Game of Thrones, Terminator: Dark Fate, Black Widow or the Disney Trilogy -- especially the latter's progressing box-office total* 😂
hahaha. he man becomes a secondary character in his own show. just like they did to loki. all the networks have nothing but talentless hacks writing for them.
2021 is my last year with Netflix. Every other show they have that I might like, I'll just pirate. It's been fun.
LOL. I'm not an sjw but anti-sjw have been breaking my balls SO much that I'm happy stuff like this happens, and gets 10 times the likes over the dislikes. Watch Netflix put out more pc content and watch their revenue grow to 25 billions 😂
Man Died: Women Most Affected
Netflix parabéns por estragar o desenho! Esse negócio de lacração já está indo longe demais, se for para fazer uma história assim vcs podem fazer o seguinte, só reprisa os episódios dos anos 80. Vocês cagaram o desenho, O teaser ficou ótimo o desenho uma BOSTA. LACRAÇÃO É UMA MERDA.
Cool trailer but the show sucks.
I had to come back and give this a dislike for the utter shit that this show was, the trailer is the only thing good about it, screw you netflix WHEN WILL YOU LEARN, this could have been so good.
The flesh is weak
I’m confused, why did the people making this trailer create something that leans so heavily into everything people loved about the original series and have nostalgia for, when the actual series itself goes out of its way to tear all that down?
Well everyone had been fooled by KEVIN " I WANT DISNEY JOB" SMITH well done netflix well done netflix goodluck on your Decrease Subscription
How to create modern garbage 101
Show sucks, Kevin Smith lied, yada yada yada
Strong muscular manly woman represent traits the woke lack and desire. And shared traits their insufficient parents never provided.
Heard this show is garbage
Wow, is the music is by Bill Conti from the 1987 film?
So this answers a few she ra mysteries
Kevin Smith you are a LIAR AND A DUCHBAG!!!!🤨
Teela looks like trans not gonna lie ..
You all have a mission: thumbs down for the Teaser here; thumbs down in the Netflix platform (they are wary about it); Rotten Tomatoes half star. He-man needs you, his fate is now worst than death, and only you can save him.
That was disappointing. Thought it was going to be a He-Man/Skeletor cartoon. Turned out to be a Teela and the girls story. This trailer is false advertisement.
For all the people saying Kevin Smith lied about this being a show about He-Man.... Does the title say He-Man anywhere? It says Masters of the Universe: Revelation.... I think most of us just assumed it would be a show about He- Man.
Thanks Netflix, you ruined my childhood again.
How did this series not get a beat-em-up computer game back in the day (golden axe style)….there is still time
Kevin Smith did a major trolling and the comments show that he pulled it off well 🤣
Forgot what the critics say....I just finished watching it. I got to say it's pretty good. It breathe new life into the lore of He-Man and allows it to grow. People are the mad because the first season is told from an established female character point of view. Also that Gray skull is a black man. Dumb Asses.... it's a fictional show. You really have to be racist and sexist to be mad at fictional characters...smh. Netflix please make season 2...Also Skelator looked so badass at the end
Thanks (but no thanks) for ruining the show....
Mathemann
Sailormoon but US version
Kevin Smith & Netflix your dun fuked up son. Subscription Cancelled!  It hurts you came out with this when I had such high hopes for it. You didn't want HE-MAN you wanted SHE-RA. You had your platform and market, but you had to go mess with Nostalgia. Kevin I know you only have daughters and want to live your life through them, but the material is there for them.
SHE MAN!!...
Kevin Smith is a LIAR!
This trailer is a LIE. He-man is barely in his own show.  The woke cultist at Netflix choose to elevate a "strong woman".  Unsurprisingly a lesbian as well, of course, of course Wow, how original...
I am a fan of the old series and I LOVED the new version! Thanks Netflix!
I cancelled my Netflix subscription.
This was the greatest disappointment of the year Netflix...
This could have been so good. Such a waste
tee-man master of force choking of empowering women
Watching this for sorceress
Skeletor is joker, joker is skeletor
Why are they always slotting in these female characters that have a sort of lesbian evolution or are already gay like in this and in the "New Warriors" with marvel? I don't understand why we've got to make everyone wear pastel colors, cut their hair into a boy cut or be ambiguously gay for Liberals to be happy with the comic...
Dear Netflix if you reading my comments then please make note we he man fans don't want any further season's of crap show it's disgusting and dishonor to the fans  and to show itself  SOS
Go woke go broke Netflix. I've been telling everyone disappointed by this bait and switch betrayal of the He-Man fans to unsubscribe from your platform. Go ahead and laugh, but you underestimate how many of my generation loved this show and how angry we are to see something we loved turned into something to spite us, all the while being lied to that it was being made for us. Go woke, go broke.
I'll keep my he man rustic from the eighties to hell with this new trash !
When netflix becomes gender liquid: he-man becomes she-man. Don't ruin those memorable days of childhood.
Eh what do we expect from company that promoted pedofilic garbage like “cuties”?
Why he man is so weak.. even teela seems to be stronger
I wonder how someone manages to spoil one of the most successful animated series of all time? Has not even 10% to do with the original and has the potential to be the worst Netflix production of the year. What a shame!
i just watched episode 2.... is this a joke ? wtf is wrong with you guys at netflix ?
Its Awful watched the first episode and i cant they should have called it teela i mean we could have good female characters without shitting on nostalgia and making male characters useless.
What's the name of background music ?
This b**** teela being angry on Adam for her not knowing he’s a he-man and keep hating him even after his death is on a level of invincible’s stupidity where his gs was mad he didn’t tell her who he was when she knew it 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️
And another Woke Trash Show thanks for nothing
They couldn't even include the original background music and animation is worst my childhood favourite spoiled by Netflix thanks for that..........
I knew it would be click-bait with he-man just like they did with star wars, tlou2, terminator even with vampire the masquerade bloodlines 2 (they used old creators for their names and then kicked them out)  to get some attention just to switch it about another toxic masculine wamah crying about herself.
I'm actually shocked that Netflix still has the comments on this. Long story short we were lied to. No he man, teela show, complete change from the original. No fan of the original enjoys this. This trailer is a complete lie. Look Netflix, we already have the strong female protagonist in your She-ra series... Why do you have to destroy the last good thing from the '80s? They killed GI Joe, they killed transformers, they even killed the Ninja turtles ( damn you Michael Bay). If these first five episodes turn out to be a dream sequence And we go back to the status quo, I guarantee you you are going to have a large wave of fans coming back and supporting this with everything they got. Especially in the form of money for the merchandise. It's not too late, fix your mistake.
Teela and the masters of the universe*
He-Man and the Vaginas of the Universe!
This show sucks.
Well, just another show not worth watching. If that was what you were aiming at, good job i guess.
Horrible, Bait & Switch that ends on a Cliffhanger, It seems Powerhouse Animation should just stick with Castlevania since its their "One Trick Pony".
HAHA did you watch it?
Garbage! You should have named this bulls*hit Mistresses of the Universe!
When  will it be  releasing in India?
SPOILER : HE IS DEAD in first episode.
Skeletor giving me mad Ainz Ooal Gown vibes
Tesla is man at arms and a lesbian! Wow!!
its not about he-man !!!🤯 its about teela and her girl friend 👭 just dont watch it , it will ruin your nostalgia 😢
They fkd this up big time'  We need a reboot asap
Look how they massacred my boy
I'm just here for Chris wood
Wow you hyped up this even showed He-man in the thumbnail and killed him off. Screw you Netflix
Came back to dislike. Classic bait and switch. Just another classic butchered by woke garbage . Even Skeletor isn’t this evil
THIS IS THE MOST CRAP I'VE EVER SEEN!!! WHY HAVE THEY RUINED HE MAN?!?!? I HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR THIS!! WHY DIDNT KEVIN SMITH LEAVE THIS ALONE AND RUIN SOME OTHER FRANCHISE!!!???
This show is garbage.
It’s not  HE-MAN it’s SHE-BITCH
Kevin Smith... WTF dude... ?!?!
Worst He-Man yet. The cartoon itself looks great but its not the He-Man story that I want. He-Man is probably in the series for 20 minutes in the four espisode. Disappointment. Kevin Smith lie to us all. LoL
Returned here to dislike
As a kid, I hated He-Man. But I'd never have wished this on him. Shame on you Kevin Smith
When I first saw this preview, I thought it was going to incorporate She-Ra to bridge the 2 shows and bring things more into the 21st century perspective. Now that the show has released, all I can say is this is all about tearing down a fan favorite franchise because it has a strong masculine lead. This show is udder garbage. Thanks Netflix!
Woke garbage
Wait the cat Cringer can talk like a human? That's a dissapointing change from filmation and 200x.
You guys ruined He man lol.
geez if you gonna highlight teela as a main character just make a filler spinoff series......SJW shits..... plus teela's new character design is soooo SJW she looks more KAREN now ughhhh,this is why anime is getting better they ignore SJW and most of the time they are true to the character design based on a source material/manga, if you guys want a good series ignore and stop injecting this SJW shits into shows, this series has a really good potential and the animation are good but damn adding SJW makes everything go really bad downhill
I foresee many masters of the universe revelation action figures ending up in a landfill due to low sales
Honestly i felt like skeletor was pretty good amd probably the only reason i enjoyed this show im all for having teela but this shit kinda just curbstomps He-Man in general and just throws everything you knew in the trash i would've loved for them to tell us that Teela was the main character instead of hyping up the Trailers as what seemed to be a decent He-Man remake with He-Man as the main character and not just a guest character that shows up a few time and dies like twice
Nice I was afraid Orco wasn’t gonna show up in this trailer !
what a joke
Shame on you Netflix, and shame on you Kevin Smith......She-Man: Master of the Woke Universe
Absolutely loving the show so far great story, superb animation and the characters are all done brilliantly. Please bring it back for a season 2 Netflix.
i clicked thumb-up last time... came back to click thumb-down... thanks for ruining my childhood hero...
Lol those dislikes are rising up
she-man
So disappointed in all this..considering canceling Netflix
What a load of mindlessness to make shows in the same-old "anime" fashion. It is so stinking generic and cheap, you people who like this only do so to make yourselves THINK you are cool when you KNOW for fact it is the stupidest way to do animation.
After how awesome Castlevania was I had high hopes for He-man. Boy was I let down.
i'm a grown ass man and i don't remember the last time i got excited about a childhood cartoon. Thank you for bring one of my favs back!!!
If this was made in china… so it will be Chi-Man “ I have the powehhhhh”
He-Man barely appears in this series and dies twice, at the beggining and then in the very end. Writters tried really hard to make the viewers like Teela but in this occasion she is insuferable and she doest make any sense most of the time. You really suberted my expectations, assholes.
Welp, bait and switch. All episodes watched.....I was almost subverted from the bad story with the virtue signaling, diversity changes,and woke nature at play due to the artwork. But then I remembered I actually like good stories, and this wasn't what was put before me. I got fan service, lots of fan service....and a bit of plot points that made me question why king randor didn't have Teela beheaded for talking out of place to a royal family....but then I seen that she couldn't be stopped by anyone...so I started wondering why do they even need heman if she's such a badass....but, magic....so..well....fuckoff writers. An epic quest to get back the sword of power, adam leaving paradise to get killed again and well....it serves him right for thinking this story was going to have a muscular white toxic man child as a lead. This trailer is very deceptive.
What a shame. Garbage, terrible. Wtf!! Leave our heroes from the past alone, stop ruinning them.
More woke crap from Nafflix.
I liked it. It was a good update of the original show and took some interesting directions. I wish they dropped all the episodes it was really short
i was expecting so much from this but it sucks its all about teela the she man :D  they have failed in every  ep ...the voice actors sucks
Orko dies.
Felt bad for Adam. How many times will the show kick the guy? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Best show since she-rah and the princesses of power omg I cant wait to see what next season brings. Im so glad they didnt get rid of that classic humor most sequals and remakes completely abandon. My only complaint that isnt a spoiler is not enough episodes the other complaint is a spoiler
Just to clarify: this show is about the Masters of the Universe, NOT He-Man, per the title. So it makes sense that the character has a more minor role. But for those still offended *SPOILER* don't worry, all the main heroes are still straight, white and cisgender and, in fact, even though this is not about He-Man, he STILL gets to be the main hero. So, if anything, this is biased towards straight, white, cisgender males...which is just what you want.
So disappointing..
WTF Netflix...you ruined another show. I gave the second episode a shot..but when I saw her shaved hair on the side I turned the crap right off. The writing, the interpersonal dynamics and characters area all completely off.
I was so excited for the show.. I just turned it off after the 2nd episode.. STRAIGHT TRASH!!!
I enjoyed the show. Although I kept expecting skelator to yell out batman  because I just kept hearing the jokers voice.
Oh yeaa FINALLY !
I have the power alright, and the power is of wokeness. You should change your name to wokeflix or feministflik or the most obvious, I hate men flix.
How you have a great cast and destroy everything we loved in one go. Kevin smith You’re a disgrace to geeks and fandoms alike.
As soon as I heard skeletor I knew it was mark hamill
This really feels like false advertising. For those expecting a continuation of the He-Man stories, you will be disappointed. Know that the show's protagonist is Teela and it doesn't do her justice at all.
DECEPCIONANTE...Esperaba ver una serie sobre He man...no sobre teela...
If you want a strong female lead, why remake He-Man and not She-Ra? I don't actually know what audience this is aimed at.
I will say, after seeing all the negative stuff about the show I went into this expecting it to be utter trash. It isn't as bad as I thought. It was actually enjoyable(I am only on episode three). But I am still super pissed at the fact that it was marketed as a He-Man show, and He-Man not being in the show for more than a collective of 15 minutes kinda sucks... a lot. If they some how brought he man back, and made him the focus of the next season. I could be more forgiving. But I have yet to see the end of the season, so I don't even know if that is possible with the way the story goes towards by the end. Please, feel free to reply in discussion. Right now I am in the mood to discuss the show for whatever reason.
You misspelled TEELA. Episode  descriptions:  E1 TEELA is the new Man at Arms E2 TEELA and her partner E3 While defending a village TEELA and her group E4 TEELA faces a sinister entity E5 A familiar figure offers TEELA  What do you get when you have an over the hill clown like Kevin Smith team up with Leftist Netflix: He-Man, but without the He-Man and more lesbians.
This show is so aweful. Kevin Smith ruined the source material and spat on 40 years of fandom. Don't watch this true heman fans. Watch the reviews and don't even watch this show on Netflix.
I just watch this its total crap, I was a Netflix subscriber
Trash.
Don’t watch this it’s trash.
Welp, just finished it. Aaaand I wanna go back in time and punch a baby Kevin Smith. I wish you progressive wankers would just make up your own stuff instead of destroying the good ol stuff.
Congratulations you ruined another series you scrubs
So He-Man is dead, and now its a Teela-Man ? Don't you have She-Ra for that?
Reading the comments here aged well like a fine wine xd
"Still know the tune?" "He'll fight for freedom, wherever there's trouble...!"
Let me guess: He-man fights to save his wife's black son from the clutches of Skeletrump or some such woke garbage
The ending……😶
They made him a boii
What’s the difference between this and Batwaman? 😂🤣😂
Waiting for part 2
Oh My God This is More like Teela Show Crew!😆
" -Well, they finally did it. They killed my f***ing car.- " -- err, Netflix & Smith took an 80's staple and set it on SocJus "puree" in the Identitarian bullsh1t blender.  At least Mark Hamill is a plus.
Did anyone really think Netflix was gonna make a tv show about a iconic jacked white guy being awesome and it was going to be good?!!?In 2021!?!! Really? Did you see ghostbusters, Star Wars? And all the others..Did you really not see this coming? Enough with the nostalgia. It’s dead and gone. Let’s all grow up. Talking about it just provides more hype for the show making them more money.
Americans really are triggered by anything. The rest of the world doesn't give a shits ass about your politics.
The Teela Show
1st Star Wars and now this...??  Fer crying out loud, this should have been called Mistresses of the Universe.🤦🏾‍♂️
Everybody down vote this show, it was a lie!
It doesn't look as interesting as the reboot that ran on Cartoon Network.
Should be called She-Man Mistress of the Universe. If you want to watch your favorite childhood show without the main character then this is for you.
Just watched series.. dont expect alot of He man and Skeletor. It was enjoyable for fan of original series. First episode was great then kinda slows down til end. Season ending was nice.  Look forward to season two.
Well at least they didn't call it He-Man, Masters of the Universe because we know it's Teela, Masters of the Universe. I don't think they should even use the word master and it to be honest. Sounds racist to me. LOL. The show is stupid
He-man gets killed off in the first ep, so the show isn’t about him.  You’re welcome.
She-Man.  More neofeminist garbage.
So in the 6th episode, are they gonna castrate He-Man & give his junk to Teela?  Cause that's where it seems like it's going at this point.
Thanks NETFLIX , you hired Kevin smith to destroy HE-MAN
Why cant I watch this on German Netflix. Gues i go to jail for watching it somewhere else
I don't get why people still had hopes for this. It clearly was taking the rise of skywalker route. Just glad I was never a fan of the original series just passing on my regards to actual fans for their loss.
From now on when I sing the original He-Man song.  I'm going to replace the he with a she since that's what this show did.  Should have turned Skeletor into Skeletora to seal the deal.
Why do people keep ruining old stuff. Just make your own thing , stop trying to remake old stuff into sjw bs. Of course we all know you can't make your own thing because you have never had an original thought in your lives, but you could at least try.
Oooh, so you ruined He-Man now? Hahaha! What a crapfest~
Hey, guess what! It's garbage.
I am SO hyped for this!!!
Looks off the hook BUT I cannot amd will NOT get over how WEAK He-Man sounds!! He sounds like a punk! Where's the bass at?
This trailer uses up just about every frame of He-Man's role in the entire series. Eat balls, Kevin Smith. You too, Netflix.
This show is straight ass.
Clownfish TV was right about this show lol
Bait and switch. Rinse and repeat, This is really getting old... I am DONE with these reboots and reimaginings. The irony here is that the more these people try to "subvert expectations" with well-loved and established franchises, the more predictable and formulaic they become.
JOKETOR FOREVER! LOL!  It was so bad,
This is horrible I just watched it This is not what I wanted I really feel let down
O M F G !!!! IS THIS THE HE-MAN ?????
Hey Netflix!!!!!!! This is not following He-Man and now I’m mad cause this show just sucked ass
spoiler alert          he man dies twice         butch lesbian doesnt
Bait and switch by the biggest master baiter, Kevin “I’ll Cry at Anything You Want Me To” Smith.
Came back to dislike cause this show sucks.
I just watched this.. its not he-man its yes ma'am...
Holy $hit Skeletor won. This was dark af.
Now I understand why they didn't put He-Man in the title. After episode 1 it goes from He-Man and The Masters of The Universe to Teela,the strong rebellious independent woman and Her Black Girlfriend.Smh.
So it's not about He-man ?
Thanks for ruining he-man netflix
JOKETOR! LOL
If this doesn't have any re-used stock footage, it's not authentic. 🤣
What a honest bait and switch disappointment.
Kevin lied. The show is shit.
I just renamed the new version of Skeltor in this crap show. Lets call him JOKETOR!  AH HA HA AH HA HA HA!!!
I just watched the first episode last night, I grew up with the early 2000s reboot on Cartoon Network & honestly this version does NOT do it justice. I don't think the voice actors they chose for some of the characters don't fit especially King Randor, & Man at arms. I'll probably give it another try but I'm not impressed.
Yo did these guys just take out he-man from the title? Damn that's pretty messed up.
Kevin "Last Jedi" Smith.
What a freak show
someone owes clownfish TV an apology
Netflix.  GO F*** YOURSELF
I just watched this and man it was dope, but Netflix always cutting a good show short,  then we have to wait 50 Damn years for new episodes..   I hate when they do that shit,   Why not wait until you have a full damn show before releasing it..
Wtf do you do? Interesting idea, badly executed.   Spoiler: He-Man needed to be back in play at the end of the last episode for this narrative to work. Leaving it on a cliffhanger with Kevin Smith stating that ‘Prince Adam is dead’ will turn off potential fans and ensure no-one bothers to come back to ‘Part 2’ Teela is a great character, but by the end of episode 5 I was sick of her. The show appears to be building towards her becoming the next champion of Greyskull in He-Man’s place and if so, this franchise will die overnight.
Just saw five minuttes of the first episode and I have to say.. it sucked enormously to se Adam like a skinny little bitch and Teela as an angry butthurt transgender weightlifter.. Netflix and the rest of the woke horrorshow can go straight to hell..
I'm going to summarize what's happening, Netflix screwed up another Classic series...     what are you still doing here? What did you expect? This is Netflix brother, always being that shit
Show sucks.
Adam:"no one else dies" *proceeds to die a second time*
We should riot. I was hoping for a better take on heman new characters new powers new weapons.   This is complete garbage.
Shame on you netfix. You killed he man twice. You bastards. You shit on his legacy.
They ruined He man
What a f***** joke. I was looking forward to a Nostalgia series and yet another show catering to wokeness. They should have just created a Teela series and no one would have a problem with it.
Everyone’s hating on this show but I really enjoyed the first season. Felt like a continuation of the 2000s series I watched growing up.   I enjoyed that it wasn’t a simple retelling. Awaiting what happens next season.
And I ate that sweet sweet lies.
Oh god no, why are Skeletors teeth white. They are supposed to be golden like his skull.
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology.
Nothing what I expected… He-man isn’t even in the series.
Spoiler: He-man dies in episode 1. By the end of season 1 100% Teela will be the new He-man.
The Teela Show?
The one thing everyone can take away from this is to never trust another reboot, reimagining, or "sequel" produced in this day and age.
Just watched it and I actually liked it
Just watched the first episode....being a fan of the original and the short-lived awesome reboot.....my royal conclusion, from this one....Teela is selfish and King Randor is a dumbass.....and Kevin Smith is the Devil Incarnate
Garbage
People are getting so upset, look at the part at 49 seconds, and you will see a scene that wasn't there NOBODY ELSE DIES, it wasn't there, he was talking about himself and everyone else.
Not sure who I heard this from today but it's very true, Kevin Smith used the fans to promote this and then he turned on them and lied to them. That's the reason he lied, so the fans would promote he man. That's so wrong to use the fans then betray them. This is unforgivable!
The Teela lesbian show. LMAO.  You didn't have to lie Craig...I mean Kevin Smith. Damn this guy really does owe a lot apologies. What little credibility he had is now completely gone.🤣🤣🤣😂
Yeah.. I watched two and a half episodes and that will do. I've always liked Teela but christ, not the entire series.
After watching and being lied too, I'm officially canceling my Netflix subscription now. Don't Ike being lied to by a company I give money to every month. This cartoon is trash and so is Kevin Smith for lying to fans along with Netflix.
COME ON GUYS LETS GET THOSES DISLIKES UPP !!!
Was woke trash dont watch it if you liked anything about this IP in the 80s it will just upset you.
Crazy how He-Man didn’t get a cameo in she-ra..you know since they are twins. But it seems like his story doesn’t mention her at all either. It’s understandable because they made she ra a girly girl show which is complete crap because if you gonna make He-Man an action packed adventure filled with magic,betrayal etc. then she ra could’ve been done the same. Now there is no way to connect the to shows..Plus the art style for she ra is for kids and he-man is more like a justice league dark movie
I’ll pass
I've never seen a single episode of 80s He-man (only know him via Vinesauce) and yet even I feel disappointed with this.
So not only did they deceive the audience about the protagonist.  They also stole the “Black Star” cartoon idea without paying the royalties😂
I like this a lot. It looks good, has interesting characters and an intriguing plot. Can't wait to see more of Teela (voiced by Buffy herself). I hope she turns into She-Ra.  PS: The show is called "Masters of the Universe" not "He-Man".
She-Man is the Master of the Universe.
So glad this woke piece of garbage is getting shit on. One day they'll learn...
Apparently, all the magic at Netflix died a long time ago cause their contents are rotting😏
This show is trash. Why would you make a masters of the univers and heman is not even a side character.
Kathleen Kennedy: "I can ruin beloved white male characters faster than anybody else!"  Kevin Smith: "Hold my beer..."
He-Man goes woke (thanks Kevin Smith) and is relegated to being a side-character in his own show. Oh, and the same with Skeletor too. Teela, the new MAIN character is a whining Karen. Meanwhile, all other male characters are sidelined and continually humiliated by their female counterparts. Because..."equality"?
It truly is,  I am WAHMEN hear me roar 🤣 this show was garbage. Congrats Kevin Smith for bending the knee and latching on to the woke train.
The freaking Borg is a bridge to far.
The plot is good, it’s the Tesla stuff that wasn’t
Fantastic, and next …….. Saber Rider and the Stars Sheriffs
Hamills Skeletor sounds like the Joker half the time. I love  Hamills work  but he really phoned his performance in for this show. Luckily Skeletor also died in the first episode.
Lets flood this channel with down votes. If you gave it a up vote and the show disappointed you change to a down vote.
He died. In the first episode. Its the Teela show after that. Hardly any he-man at all.
Garbage!!! Congratulations Netflix for ruining HEMAN for us. RIP nostalgia!!! Unsubscribing
Kevin Smith rickrolled all of y'all.
What a let down , Teela comes across as a whiny b@$%h and in the 5 episodes He-man is only there for 15mins
What a shitty show.
Thanks a lot asshole now I won’t pay to watch this series!!! Screw you guys!!!
I am a fan of the original. I won't spend time watching this albeit the animation looks good. Pitty, another left-wing woke piece of trash.
what a shitshow.....
Ah sos re troll
Welp. Everything was awesome but Jokertor does not a skeletor make. Mark Hamill was a terrible choice and just makes think the clown prince of crime is in disguise, all you hear is joker voice again and again Brian Dobson did it better. 🤷‍♂️
Its he man and he dies off first episode wtf show should have been named theela instead he man suposed to be main character bad they hyped me for nothing so i drop it
Trash
What a waste. Even the kids were like wtf. They were so bored they didnt even watched the whole first episode. I watched the first three. Total garbage. Teela was way better before.
Kevin Smith's next project is the original animated ninja turtles that has April o Neil going on a adventure to find all four missing turtles...  Then superman the new animated series, were he dies in the beginning and Lois lane must find out who killed superman.  And then barbie the live action movie, staring ken in woman clothes and barbie died from high blood pressure
Netflix is absolute shit! Cancel your subscriptions!
Was looking forward to this.  However, this series by Netflix is pure crap.  Thumbs down.  1 out of 10 stars.
Castration if he man  Lesbi power show
F U Kevin!!!
Cancelling my Netflix subscription. I rarely watch it anyway.
Aaaaaand here we go AGAIN... seriously what non-feminin feminist misandry snakes are responsible  for media nowadays. This is getting ridiculous.  Onbnoxiously scared of masculinity they make a show about a dude like Female-ish protagonist and not HE man and have the audacity to call it he-MAN. And off course she can go head to head easy. Sure.  First they ruin ghostbusters then terminator fight club star wars... the list goes on. Poor kids nowadays.
I haven't seen yet nor been spoiled. I can't wait to watch, I'm a huge He-man fan!!!
Lots of hate.  Maybe deserved maybe not.  I'm not sure if I'll bother as I was luke warm to He-man as a kid.  I absolutely hated when Orco would pop up at the end and preach.  Orco was Jar Jar for me long before Jar Jar existed.  From the comments I understand there is at least one scene that will make me smile.  I wasn't aware this was in the works until it actually hit.  So He-man is second fiddle now and Shera gets top billing?  It won't bother me as long as the story is good.  If it sucks like all the New Star Wars movies (minus Rogue One) then it deserves to die.    As to people being misled.  When I bring up Masters of the Universe Revelations Shera is on the cover and He-man isn't on the cover and isn't even mentioned in the title.  Obviously Nostalgia isn't gonna carry this one so maybe there won't even be a season 2 - or perhaps there will and He-man will get more time.
People don't buy merchandise of this series. Hopefully Kevin Smith will be held accountable
JUST WATCHED THIS AND WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP ! Seriously the show is more about women's power than it is HE-MAN !! Another woke piece of turd !
To bad the show turned out to be what everyone was expecting (shit) and Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology.
WATCH CASTLEVANIA INSTEAD...FAR BETTER
The magic is indeed gone.
Totally ruined one of my childhood heroes - thanks for nothing. Kinda getting over the 'female action hero' at every turn. I wonder if the people who make these decisions ever actually think about who will actually watch action movies/shows/anime? Um lets see, teenage boys? Men? Fathers with their sons? I know my daughter doesn't have much interest in watching this type of content, so can we please get back to the male action hero like we did when there was alot more common sense around!
So watched all five episodes. If Netflix didn't have Stranger Things, The Witcher, Kingdom (Virgin River 😉) and some COOL Korean horror shows - I'd cancel my subscription. I'm sick of them destroying IPs that should have been really good. The Resident Evil Season 1 was AWFUL. But compared to MOTU its a masterpiece. MOTU looks AWESOME though 🔥 I'll give you that. But some of the voice casting was terrible - Mark Hamill is NO Skeletor. Joker - definitely. Killing He-man TWICE is unforgivable. Plus some of the characters remaining were seriously unlikeable. Sigh. This is NOT a toxic comment. Its just an honest review, from an old fan of the series. Rotten Tomatoes is sitting on 25% audience score. I'm clearly not alone. Netfix - look to Amazon Prime and Invincible to see how an IP should be properly done. Oh dear. What a mess 👎
Absolute garbage.
What a disappointment in the fifth episode. I feel like I've been screwed like  in Game of Thrones. You can't let die an important character in the story...and after a ressurrection certainly not a second time. This is a cheeky slap in the face to the fans and not a good narrative storytelling. 👎👎👎
The whole issue of cartoon and movie franchises becoming woke and being destroyed is 100% about the nerds, outcasts and socially inept kids of the 80's and 90's, taking over these studios and shitting on the kids that used to bully them in school.
This show should be called The Rise of Teela
F you Netflix and F you Kevin Smith you filthy liars. I am THIS close to swapping to amazon prime and I HATE amazon but not nearly as much as your lying, show ruining asses.
Garbage 👎👎👎
0:22 this is me after learning that he-man is dead and gone in this series
Master of the Gay verse!! Netflix kills one of my favorite cartoons of all time so screw u Netflix!!
Come on guys, the title clearly just says "Masters of the Universe: Revelations." He-Man is NOWHERE on it! This was *obiously* _never_ going to be about him! . . . . . ...that's pretty much just what I tell myself to get over the feeling of getting gypped, because I watched this fully expecting a He-Man show.
Thx for the Show Kevin! I IT is realy GOOD!!!
They turned it into political garbage
BAIT and SWITCH...classic wokery tactic
The Dolph Lundgren  He-Man movie is better than this. I'm being sarcastic 🤣 But for real though Masters of the universe without He-Man as the protagonist is a no no
Just saw this garbage.  Cringe.
Trash like all the things NETFLIX produces
There removing dislike. Lol. Had to re-add mine.
Bad experience! What an awful episode...
Man, so Kevin Smith going to go ahead and apologize to clown fish tv for all the hate he spewed their way over this?
Still better than She Ra
Best screw up ever ruining he-man
To Netflix execs" just put names Kevin Smith and Marc Bernandin on you blocked persons list.
they cucked he-man its now she-man
This was a disgrace, that's all I'm going to say.
Ok so I know there are people saying that this is garbage but I still want a chance to watch it and I can't for some reason. Tried searching it up on Netflix and it did not come up. I thought it came out today?
Orko was great now he is a pathetic loser.
Utter.  Trash.
Kevin Smith is such a fuckin tool. He's no better than Kathleen Kennedy.
She-man
Excellent job on He - Man  Master of the Universe  is awesome and Amazing Thank you Thank you 😊 I hope  the  She-Ra coming  in and I hope  the have more Season's
Whoa.
Tremendo bait que nos comimos :(
Just got thru watching this,  this "remake" is nothing short of garbage
Kevin smith is a pos
This actually upset me I didn't even get angry it was just a disservice calling the conclusion to the 1980s show
We've Been Tricked, We've Been Backstabbed and We've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled!
Do you ever get the feeling they make these things out of spite or something? I don’t mean to come off as emotional or overly opinionated… but what did Kevin Smith expect from this? They advertised it as he-man, vocally lied about it on media, slandered anyone that called it for what it actually was going to be, killed he-man twice in a 5 episode season but in between those deaths found time to make him useless and pathetic.   I guess I just didn’t have a good time with this. I thought I was getting he-man but now I don’t want to see them do anything else to him.
He Soy: Ma'am of the Betas
Not good enough Netflix. The false advertising and lack of He-Man in a He-Man series is unforgivable.  I'm done with this crap. Time to cancel Netflix.
Wasted my time watching this. Why did they go woke and sh*t on He-Man
Aweeee
If you want to see He-man, just watch this trailer. All the He-man scenes are there... Saved you 2 hrs.   P. S: if they would had said "Teela's show" , it wouldn't have been that bad. Hated orko, and cringer (like the originals), not a big fan of Teela's new look, but the story wasn't that bad. It's just we all thought this was "he-man" show, not a teela show. The best thing about this show is evil Lyn. They did a amazing job with her. She should get her own solo series like teela.
What a disgrace. These people sure love wasting money
Talk about Clickbait/ Catfish. Thought I was watching he-man, ended up watching She-man. The future is female ideology usurp another male character and the Hollyweird agenda to feminize everything continues
Main character sidelined for another one...So here we go again. Just like Witcher s1.
Clownfish TV was right...
LOL bait and switch he man gets a pass from me
So.....Kevin Smithy......about Clownfish TV........you wanna admit?
You lied to us. This is no He-Man show 😡
very disappointed kevin smith your just another woke jizzeater
Uhhhh... That was awful!!! I hate to say it but shame on you Kevin Smith! And why is this abomination of a series even called He-Man when he is not even in it. And to make matters worse they killed him TWICE in the first 5 episodes. Until now I had nothing against feminism but they have gone way too far.
Nothing pisses off man-children more than watching a show/movie with female leads. Oh you poor, poor tortured babies! 🍼
Why is everyone surprised it sucks? Kevin Smith was never talented.
You actually f*cking lied to us. You advertised this as a He-Man show, and kept saying the whole at through that it’s about He-Man. Why would you lie this hard? What did you have to gain?
You could have advertise MOTU as a story told from Teela's point of view and people would have loved it. Then you killed off Orko. What were you thinking. I am not buying any toys for me or nephews.
Waste of time, what a shame... the trailer does not represent the show at all.
Kevin Smith owes the fans and Clownfish TV an apology, super disappointed, hang your heads in shame Kevin and Netflix
The trailer showed all of he-man's screen time 🤣
Thanks for nothing Netflix.. shame
bruh.. they screwed this show up 1st episode... sry kevin but this aint it..
Where is HE-MAN in this? Disappointing. NETFLIX DO BETTER!
Not bad for false advertisement
👍
YOU BASTARDS YOU RUINED ALL!!!  DAMN YOU ALL TO HECK
What an abomination.  Just another Strong Wahman lead character that denigrates men.
Watching it now on Netflix. Sorry to spoil it for y'all, but He-Man's not even in it. I think Kathleen Kennedy is on the production staff. I was a sleep when I watched the first one back in the 80s. This one, however, has definitely woken me up haha.
Butchered my childhood
This Show is not about the Masters of the Universe, its about the Masters of the Feminist
Disappointed as this isn't Even Good for the Old days Vibe .The Animation is good but He-Man Isn't Much of a Man in This and plays more of a bit part in his own Show .This is just more Woke Rubbish ruining something I once fondly remembered .
Disappointed in everything I am hearing.  I loved He-Man as a kid. I had all the toys. The Grayskull, the bird space ship, the thing that looked like a green landspeeder with wings, even Snake Mountain (*until my brothers broke it). Loved the show and frankly, Teela was one of my favorite characters. But you can raise someone up without tearing others down. If it isn't about He-Man, don't call it that. Maybe this is for the new breed of He-man fans (are there any?) but they seemed to market this as if the old fans would like it. Most of them will hate it. The animation looks good. But I won't bother with it - it isn't even worth giving a chance if the key characters you loved get torn down... like everyone is sharing.
This didn't age well.
I had high hopes for this series but after episode one you know where it's headed - Episode 2 Teela full on Feminist mode almost looked like a man, I'm sure if I zoomed in she probably grew hair on her armpits, and most likely smelled like a man too.  You know that Unnecessary scene from End Game that "girl power" scene, yeah that one, that's HE-MAN now all girl team up to save HE-MAN crap. HE-MAN doesn't need saving in the old series, this version is just one way to shove woke snowflake views again!! Oh oh now I remember this is exactly as 'cringy' as watching Captain Marvel.  Why am I watching Teela the Feminist Snowflake, I guess this is why the title of the series is Masters of The Universe Revelation- yeah the Revelation that there's no longer He-Man of old because it's now the Teela w armpit hair show.  But don’t worry there are only 5 episodes for now “it’ll get better” Like How?! HE-MAN wears pink undies in battle next?!  It’s Tee-Man
In feminist He-man main character will be teela... Netflix.. you can put you woke heman up your 455
Go to hell, Netflix.
this trailer is a big big big clickbait.
Dude holy shit that's gunna be so good
This show was realy awful. I had low expectations and this show was even worse then what I expected; between Teela's moodswings, He-Man being incapable of doing anything, Adam just sucking, Teela the new Man at Arms, this show is not worth watching.
It's getting harder and harder to remember the days when Netflix made good shows.  Oh well, on the bright side I always wondered how on earth Kevin Smith could like the Last Jedi.  Now I know.  The man has AWFUL taste.  Please, never direct again.
Very interesting storyline. Now they just need to make a Voltron Defender of the Universe and Masters of the Universe crossover. Lotor can be Skeletor and Evil lynns lost child and the lion Voltron would pay some tribute to Battle Cat.
Woke propaganda...nuff said. Im done with this s·$%&T. Do yourself a favor, watch the first episode and leave.
All the He-Man scenes were from the first episode lmao
I mean, what to expect?  The producer said he don't like he-man in the first place and if he going to remake it ofc he will change into something that suit his and "their" taste.   They never care about the show or the community that make this show remarkable in the first place.    Netflix, you got your Twitter audience in exchange of  losing the geeks that actually care about it.  Happy now?
Hey, can you pretentious hipster marxists stop shitting all over everything that I used to like?
"He Man does no stepping aside" -kevin smith".    After watching the show how he can say this is outstanding.  This show is great, When it's about He Man.  The teela parts (the majority are show) are boring and badly written.  Be honest next time kevin smith so I don't waste my time.
This woke shit is ruining everything
Teela lesbian, man at arms considered more dangerous than he man... This series is a f. Nonsense
GET WOKE GO BROKE
This is the most he-man you will get and that is no joke
It only took one episode to ruin a franchise. Kevin Smith was not a fan of "Masters of the Universe" and it shows with "Revelations". You want to watch a GREAT updated He-Man series? Watch the 200X series. SO much better.
Poor and unfaithful handling of the original source material. Cannot recommend.
Yeah, no.
When he appear on netflix romania?
1:16 who the red headed guy?
YAASSSSSS!!!!!!
So Kevin Smith did lie ... shocking heh
It's feminist propaganda, boycott this piece of garbage.
Well all the rumors were true. Smh
Anyone else can’t see he-man on Netflix today
Reviewers have already made it clear that this show is a bait & switch.  He-man is put into the background so that Teela & her girfriend will be the main hero instead.  Kevin Smith admits they're killing off Orko for shock value.  They race swapped King Grayskull because they thought there were too many buff blonde dudes...why even make a classic show if you hate it so much you want to change everything about it?  Show runner Kevin Smith claims to be a super of the series but has been exposed to have said in the past he wasn't a fan & has no love for the character.  These people have no love for the franchise or the fans.   From another comment.
I’m Episode 3 in and now forgetting it ever existed.   Liberal Hollywood trash.
Kevin Smith the fool lied to all of you! Don't trust this cucked shill nonsense.
They Netflix it up.    Total women empowerment     They just ruin everything they touch with political agendas!
Thank you for the lies of omission.
Mark Hamil gave Skeletor a more macho sound compared to his original thin voice.. I like it, though this new voice kinda reminds me of Hordak LOL
This show sucks!! Nothing to do about He-Man!  F@ck Netflix for putting out such garbage! I cancelled my subscription!
I honestly Prefer the Original He-Man from the 80s and 90s. Even the She-Ra Remake was awful.
Update: Kevin Smith is a liar and owes Clownfish TV an apology
Okay This series sucks balls! it is officially SHE-MAN and the LESBIANS OF THE UNIVERSE!!
Loved He-Man as a kid but Netflix managed to destroy another great show animation was great show was trash
Aaaand they fu**** it up. Another show with karen as main charakter
NGL this was a lot better than I thought it would be. I’ve never had a problem with progressive casting, my problem is when the writers show contempt for male characters simply because they are male. Didn’t get any of that vibe here. Nor was there any Ben a whisper of romantic interest between Teela and Adara, so that turned out to be all hype. Overall good series, watch it for the story not the action- which is laughably bad and rendered at about 2 FPS.
I watched the first couple of episodes an it is awful. I'm not going to spoil anything but if you were a He-Man fan skip it. The animation is good though.
Sucks
Didn’t like it
Just watched the series. This is not the show you are promised. Everything you heard was true. Make no mistake: this show is not about He-man. This show is about Teela and He-Man is merely an afterthought/accessory. It's just more woke nostalgia grave robbing.
What the hell Netflix? This is total garbage except for the animation quality
Well this trailer and Kevin smith were lying
so after  thre episodes i have to say thats not what i wanted. i wont give spoilers but this is the wrong decision if you wanted to do sth for the fans. the children today may like it.
I am 46 right now....I was 10 ...i hope this Japanimation will be great
Animation looks great, but it seems someone lied about the rumours that He-man wasnt being replaced by Teela and other stuff. This is probably just going to try and push certain views and that. 1 star
neftlix outdone themselves....managed to make something worse than their death note adaptation.whatever survived dinsey's starwars movies just got raped to death by this pathetic barfbucket
I was promised Heman, I got SheShit. Thanks Netflix. Unsubscribe.
You ruined it Kevin Smith!!! I will never forgive you!!!
Wait, wait, wait... i'm getting excited about his but where is the knights templar cross? I'm reading comments below and is this going to be an SJW wash of a cult classic? please say it ain't so.
Well Kevin Smith caught lying
Such a waste.
Pronouns, he/man
If you want a He-Man reboot watch the early 2000 version, it's awesome. This is just garbage.
spoiler alert, its a diversity trap
Show is awful. He-Man is gone within the first 17 minutes of the first episode. It’s the Teela show and the creator lied and attacked fans for saying so. Not good.
This trailer was made to fool everyone. Teela is made the protagonist of the show and Adam is Just there to be humiliated. Another fan disservice. Hard pass
wow stunning and brave. if he-man hade the power to become a girl.
Everyone needs to stop crying, its not a remake, its a new story continuing on from the 80s, so its not going to be exactly the same.
you showed us he-Man in the trailer, but there's no he-man in the show. on the way to becoming she ra in this series
The style of animation looks awful
Wow this turn out to be shit
another fallen icon of men. killed by netflix and kevin smith
Visually, Revelations is the cartoon we wanted as kids. Unfortunately, it is being written by people who have no business handling properties of nostalgia.
No vale la pena es una porqueria.
Why would you trust Kevin Smith he's a nobody in real life
She man she does heave feminisim
Not as bad as I thought it would be if I'm being honest, certainly better than She-Ra that's for sure.
Well this turned into the Teela show.  Kevin Smith you liar.
Netflix should have done a better job orchestrating the people that remake this actual fans.Kevin Smith put on a show in got a chick  now looks stupid. With the money they put behind this it could’ve been so much better if the story was better
Teelas new haircut tells me everything I need to know about motu
Truely lord of destruction is baal
I came just to remove my thumbs up and turn it into a thumbs down. Get woke go broke, Netflix.
I'm highly disappointed in the show. It's name is misleading, he-man is barely in it.
Being extremately generous part 1 is not bad, in other words, watch the 5 episodes and move on to another thing... p.e.: Kevin Smith, please, GTFO and do smething else.
Was Kevin Smith ever big into He-Man? I doubt it, well what I mean is, this looks like it was written by a millennial, not a true Gen xer. Best thing he has ever done is Comic Book Men, and that purely down to Walt and Brian. Oh, he is pretty good at his own lore making, talking for hours over his ‘friends’ and referring to people by their full names.
HE-MAN SERIES......about TEELA....SIGH
this was bad
Malayalees evide comon
Weeks ago when I watched the first trailer I got goosebumps. Now that I watched the show, I see how much of a false advertising this was. Why did you have to ruin He-man Netflix? Teela could have had her own spin off or her own storyline within the series... Such a crappy move
Teela's show.  Teela and her girlfriend  An empowered woman against male characters.
Teela the Rey : Abomination
Just finished watching the show it's a clear switch and bait trailer.  The ending of Masters of the Universe: Revelations will infuriate old school He-man fans.
Just watched episode one and thought, well that was crap, not really He Man its She Man. Thats me done with this rubbish.
:/ wanted to see more he-man not she man.  They Got Shera, should have made another Shera cartoon and gave us a real He man series not this Teela.  Ugh.
I want to like this... but without the original score, at least for the intro music, it's just not He-Man!
Aaaaand He-Man died immediately lol
Korgoth of Barbaria is better
Hmm no He-Man in the title? Makes me wonder if he's not the main character. Only one line from Adam compared to Her 20 lines? Oh great, the main character everyone cares about is being sidelined.
Why Kevin Smith have go lie about everything? He's more sketchy than J strung out on heroin
First Class all the way. Can't wait to see the move...
I grew up, watching He-Man. I have the entire series, collection, from old school. This is Priceless...
Cringelacringe "I'm no fan of He-Man either."  - Kevin Smith
*IT'S MA'AM and the Masters of the Pronouns*
Lmao Netflix comes out with another woke piece of trash
Would have been better as a live action show.
Master of the universe, the first of magical boy.
One of my favorite shows ruined, thanks Netflix it’s about time I stop giving you my money!
I am really looking forward to this ! My twin brother and I grew up with the original, and of course the toys. Well, as many as we could get dad to fork out for. These rumours about He Man not being the main character would have to be BS. No one would be that silly to mess with what works. Let's be real here, most of the people that tune in will be old fans annd their kids. I'm off to watch now !
Epic scene 1:55
"I'm no fan of He-Man either."  - Kevin Smith
I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The show is a bait and switch. It's feminist and jewed propaganda
Mark hamill voice acting? I’m in already.
I hope they come out with a game where u can make your own he man an play with original characters in new story
Great! NETFLIX dooched up HeMan
Even then, why’s it so bad if it is a Tee’la series?? Yeah, roast me fools ! I’m a nobody!
One way to make this series really unique is to have the other characters in the show go off on their own adventures. If He-Man is still the main character, but they occasionally show what the other people are doing around Eternia as they go on their own quests, I might be okay with it still. Then they could have a big meet up at the end of the season for something epic.
This show much like cake, is a total lie.
Me: Fangirling like it's 1984, shipping AdamxTeela since the dawn of civilization. LOVE LOVE LOVE
master of woke...
How many episodes til they bring out the gay stuff?
Saw an ad on Facebook that used action Figures. I was diapointed to find out this was an animated show. I was thinking lego movie or Robot Chicken type show.
Woke bollocks.
Her-Woman: Mistresses of the Universe  Can't wait
As a 1984 baby I always confused Thunder Cats and He-Man 😂
Too bad this is going to be Tee-la and the masters of the universe instead of He-Man
You couldn't have gone with something more like "Teela and I hate He-man but I can't come up with original characters so I'm breaking your toys and going home: Revelation"
Clownfish was right. Kevin Smith owes them an apology.
Bait and switch.
Cy-Clopes was always my favorite. he was so cool.
This is a mockery of the original.
Let the angry nerds be angry. I like my warrior women realistically muscular.
Bait and switch, woke trash.   Creatively broke activists ruin yet another pre-existing beloved IP because  they haven't the integrity to create their own characters. Gotta hand it to Netflix for continually giving reasons to not resubscribe.
Let's hope nothing goes wrong here.
Another political toggaf version  Nope ... and I'm a big motu fan
People who are complaining that this isn't about He Man, it's called Masters of the Universe: Revelations not He Man: Revelations. The masters of the universe are She Ra and He Man. It can be about them both.
Trash
Looks like crap and I am not talking about the Animation
She woman and the masters of the universe.
I heard Cersei’s voice and my heart ached.
Its a trap He man is not the protagonist
It's kinda sad how the show that was all about acceptance and kindness to others is now forcing the MC out of his own show on account of his race, gender, & muscleleyness
Everyone is talking about Tela and Adam but I really don't care.  Can't wait to see Skeltor in action ,The villains were my favorite.
No thank you I relationship built on lies is never good
Ta chegando!
Woke trash.
My qBittorrent is ready.
Not gonna watch this shit after finding out that he-man isnt the main lead.
Things that are very likely/almost certain to happen,  1. He-Man loses the sword of power, so is stuck as the weak man Adam 2. Teela becomes the strong female who rallies everyone together and saves everyone including He-man  3. Teela becomes Man-At-arms 4. Teela has a lesbian relationship 5. Orko dies because their research polls showed he was the least popular character. But not before they emotionally manipulate the audience to feel sorry for him 6. Teela becomes the wisest and most respected person in Eternia 7. It's our fault we don't like it because we are not intelligent enough to understand why Kevin Smith is a genius and all these changes were necessary in 2021
1:06 OK that voice on Cringer is just a NO.
Also, I know this show isn't just about He-Man. The way I see this, I think they wanted to focus more on the former background characters this time around. Which explains the "Revelation" part of the title. However, Kevin Smith shouldn't have trolled the fans from the older franchise. People would've enjoyed this new series better if it wasn't of him.
Imagine if Netflix made a Critical Role show with these graphics...
My eight years old watched this trailer and said it looked like shit. It's shit. Leftie wamen shit that's my pow. And i lived he-man in the eighties.
It's Hollywood & Netflix bait and switch pure and simple. Stay away if you want to preserve your childhood memories.
Like I said from the beginning: this show will be woke and Kevin Smith is a lying shill.
You betrayed us, this is Teela's show, not He-Man!
Skeletor sounds exactly like Aku on Samurai Jack.
great identity politics at play and hollywood woke garbage
Please do not watch or support this. Give Netflix and destroyers like Kevin Smith a strong message. You cannot ruin our shows and succeed.
I like how the cast members are actively hanging shit on the target demographic for this...worked well for  Paul Fiege, Elizabeth Banks & Tim Miller etc. Perhaps start using the word "customers" instead of "fans" you idiots
Of course like everything it's about empowering women and putting men in the background as much as they can
I think this will be another Ghostbusters 2016, we will just ignore it like it never happened...👍😉
So the sword is actually split like the toys, far out man!
Spoiler alert it's Teela's and the mistresses of the universe. Spoiler alert Oracle is not the only one who dies.
And when I wake in the morning and I step outside....
Well looks like the Clownfish tv leaks that were supposedly all "lies" were true after all.
This is going to be a woke calamity isn’t it.
Woke trash, turned it off after finding our it's a show about lesbians
He man dies twice in this
Teela hair looks ridiculous.... but all of us don't care about Teela
Of course.  “Strong” female roles that were never in the original…..same flicking formula to destroy old successful franchises… pass
From what I hear, it's gonna be ruined by wokeness for Teela. Any confirmation of this?
LAME
Garbage
i’m in. netflix don’t let this old man down.
A show for young boys where the main character is named He-Man, is a show lacking a strong male character. Me and my boys will pass and continue to enjoy the original.
wasn't teela the captain of the guard?
And the reviews are in. It’s the Teela show. So, nah.
So they took the animation from the last air bender and made a reboot
She-man and the Masters of the Universe!!!
Looks a bit…woke. No thanks.
She mam. Show is about Teena. Another bait and switch show.
Woke. Dont watch
Can these media companies make anything that isn't a sequala or an adaptation? All these things do is make the actual good shows and movies look bad.
Teela gains the generic design ability
He man dies ..twice and is hardly in the show...so
Another strong female character?
Reviews are in its woke. Don't waste your time
Hyped!
Seriously Kevin and Netflix.....@#$! U and u neutered he-man
Is that Cerise Lannister I hear?
Clownfish tv was right about everything.
Revelation's pretty much Netflix She-Ra 2.0.
This better be awesome.   No exceptions just Awesome
DOA, Masters of the SHE Universe, being a brown guy who grew up from the 80's, I have NO interest for this despicable reprehensible malicious corrupt show, this should be the He-Man show not the Teela show, someone should sue for false advertising!!!!!!
Kevin Smith and the writers did a bait switch on us. Teela is the main character.
You know what? I’m taking my like back
Another great show Will be ruined. Another sad day for entertainment, just another woke crappy show.
Bet show doesn’t make the top 10 ranking #3 lol
I guess this will be cancelled because all the hate, and lies behind this. You know wht why can't old school fans of the show just shut up and grow a pear, and just wait until it comes out I mean really who cares if the main character is a female, who cares if she's in a relationship it doesn't matter as long as it's a part of the story. Unlike the old fans I don't like he man I always thought he was gay, but I wanna see the show and wht it brings to the table.
Heyaheyaheyaheya  I never watched he man but I know theme
It's already confirmed this is the TEELA show. He-Man is demoted to supporting character. Not watching this trash.
When's Masters of the Universe: Village coming out?
Looks like rumor’s where facts along 😰😰😰😰
The Teela show
I hope Clownfish TV isn't right about this show and it's agenda
Reviews are out. IT'S THE TEELA SHOW. Why did you lie Kevin.
More disgusting woke nonsense creating unecessary transformation of  existing IPs which already have a large fanbase from the 80s-90s. I  shall stick to the Filmation originals and the New Adventures of He-man.  I know this is the new regime imposed in the film industry but my total  rejection is noted and not 1 cent of my or my family's money will go  towards this. Bye bye.
Ok he man is my childehood. If you guys turn this to another woke agenda i am.done with netflix. The show is called He-man. I dont have anyhoprs after hearing some female is saving some sht.  But i ll give you guys a one episode chance
He Man's going to get killed off in the first episode, isn't he? Thanks again SJWs
I got this feeling its another PC tv series :(
Did they make He-man a simp and a villain ???!!!
evil he man what the....
I just seen it. He man dies in the beginning. No really. Holy shit. What a disaster
Screw Orko!
All of the people in the comments here like, "He-Man is selling out", and it was better in the 80s. You do realize He-Man was created with the sole-purpose to sell toys, right? It wasn't a toy based on a story. It was a story based on a toy. A, literal, sell-out series. What the heck is your definition of "selling out"? Because you don't get any more sell-out than what He-Man, literally, was in the 80s.
Or He-Man will be... not straigt...  Remember it's Netflix...  Anzthing goes...  The new church of how "free" you should live your life...
I bet it.ll be all abaut women and how strong and independent they are...  Oh yeezee.   No thanks Netflix.
My childhood hero.... By the power of grace God.... I have the powerrrrrr...
When did the green lion got balls??
I would have considered watching this crapfest, but alas, far too many white characters. Woke up netflix
Okay, they took this seriously, and try to make it good for everyone possible. It looks like it will be a great He-Man series. Thanks for getting rid of my doubts.
Race swapped 2 characters just because you know virtue points. So stuff it Wokeflix.
The Teela Show hahahaha
3 MORE DAYS!!!!!!!!
So exactly what time is this dropping?  I don’t want a repeat of She-ta where I stay up late hitting refresh only to wake up still waiting and disappointed.
oh my good netflix is on it again destroying our childhood
They need the help one 1 soldier..... The only 1 who could save eternia is ...... "Jerk-off "
Everyone is complaining about Teela being a main focus on this show, yet the episode from the original series about how she is the daughter of the Sorceress is one of the most memorable imo
Skeletor - Call your thampion.
I feel like they’re dissing he-man in this series
Just remake a normal she-ra!!!
Extra buff
like i guessed its a teela main - show. heman only in 1st episode. all your fears true. dont worry it will have wonderful ratings though
Way too much Teela for what's supposed to be a He-man show. How can you lie through your teeth & act like this is a continuation of the original show when Adam looks completely different?
I feel like he-man doesn't seem to be the main character and that worries me.
Why is battlecat talking? and why does he sound like a dumbass?
They ruined it !!!
This is very clearly no He-man or He-man focused.  He's not in the title and that's a dead give away that someone else will have the main role
Meh
If i recall corectly, in the OG series, he-man was supposed to have 1 half of the sword and skeletor the other, right?
She ra gets a show, He man gets a show
0:24 She’s got a nice muscular physique!!! Love her arms!!😘💪🏼
Kevin smith ruined heman. Nice.
LMAO, so basically this should have been called the F U He-Man show. Cancel it now before you screw up everything.
Watch this be one massive monumental screw up. Thanks Kevin.
Is this setting up SHe-Man? The new Shera show is its own thing and I really think they are trying to establish a new hero rather than focus on He-Man.
She's got a half-shaved half-bob cut so you know she's an ambiguously gay main character with zero faults and is Better Than The Men
I love this  Green Cat version
Sometimes I wonder how much hate and greed you must have to destroy all these awesome stories, and how naive ppl are to fell for nostalgia's sake. At least this gives me a reason to re-watch the original show, with its unique and legendary intro that nobody will ever be able to re-do. The transformation in this netflix abomination looks like a sailor moon's transformation, which is insulting for both original shows.
Two more days!!
Meh. Edits so fast, can't see what's goin on.
Holy shit. The trailer gave me a seizure. And that is a compliment.
They never punched in the original series
Why does it look more like it's about Teela than He-man?
Mark Hamill is Skeletor, sign me up
Gosh I hope it's woke! Omfg
canceled my subscription to Netflix went to hulu 🤘🏻 too much feminism shit , Netflix  is all about sexuality, they can't think with brains, only with their genitals
The plot has the wrong foundation because Teela discarded magic. Why would Teela do that when she is the daughter of the Sorceress the guardian of Castle Grayskull.  Her legacy is magic...in fact when Skeletor captured the Sorceress once Teela stepped up to protect Grayskull. So I know this show is not TRUTH (canon) and does not pay homage to the 1983 series
Oohhh....they better not screw this up.
I had no idea the back of my neck had so many hair!
If He Man was depowered and was on a journey to get his power back they would say he was feminized. Ignore the agenda of dudes who complain they can't get laid cause they're nice guys. You know, what's been known as a heroes journey since Aristotle.
Careful people with all the skimpy outfits these men will be wearing will turn you children gay…!!! Lol jk
CHRISSSS
Looks like shit, ngl
Everyones whining but the story could be centered on Orko .
Cancelled for toxic masculinity  And gender specific star
Removed he-mans cross ???  Gay teela??? TOXIC MASCULINITY  Non specific gender person                  And the  Lifeforms of the anyverse   Some things should stay in the past
Shouldn't this be called masters of the the universe guest starring He-man 🤔
And I say "Hey yea yea yea... I say hey"
Sarah Michelle Gellar's voice gave me goosebumps. Buffy meets He-Man! 😍
they made  prince adam too skinny but i like his he-man design
Ah finally stop girlr series
Be prepared for disappointment if you’re a fan of the original plot and character roles.
"Still know the tune?" Me: *HEYAYAYAYA, I SAID HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?*
Aguante Merman, papá!
Eternita is within all of us it’s up to us to make the difference
My Childhood's Favorite Cartoon HeMan
She-Man has the power now a days.
cant wait for smith to get ripped open a new one after people find out hes a lying scumbag
Okay...why does He-man feels like a side character in his OWN SHOW??? I'm not liking this new trailer's vibe...
Why is that everything Netflix touches it's screwed...
Please don't ruin my childhood hero I still hum the original intro when lifting heavy
So excited!!! Can't wait to see it!!!😍👍
I want to see skeletor whip he-man ass and take castle grayskull.......
Did they really have to butch up Teela??? 🙄
porq ese peinado a teela
I will not be supporting this They ruined teela she looks like a bodybuilder lesbian transexual
I can't wait!
Sweet, Kevin Smith did a great job
I didn't see orko or ram man??
Imagine He Man comes in and says   HEYEYEYEYAYAYYAYAYAAA
Skeletor! ❤️
Old memories is back 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Lasst den Mathemann in Ruhe, nur weil ihr auch He-Man benutzt!
Netflix you screw this up  With politics or feminism I'm canceling my subscription and going to hulu
*PLEASE DUB IT IN HINDI*
-_-) OMG... I was hoping for a cool He-Man reboot.. but this is NOT *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe,* this is going to be *Teela and the girl power, as long as she totally looks like a man!* She even cut her hair to look even more like a lesbian (not the sexy porn kind).
Futa -She-Man Crap
I don't get it, the "bat/H" symbol came after the introduction of She-ra and was specifically mention to be a "Post Horde" He-Man...we either better see the Horde go a step over the line... making He Man go Anakin on Tuskens over She-ra's death...
So are they looking to piece back the 2 swords to bring back the power sword? And is sarah michelle gellar voicing teela? She sounds like.
Ok, I gotta be completely honest here. When I watched He-Man or She-Ra transform in the 80's cartoons, I would get goosebumps. Every time. But this? When I saw him transform at the end of this trailer, I felt nothing but boredom. Is He-Man even gonna be the main character in this? Because most of the focus seemed to be on Teela and how much she doesn't want to be there.
Since when the symbol "+" became "H"?
Idhekkadi mass ra mawa ❤️
1:54 legit thought the answer for her question of "you still know the tune" was. "I say hay, WHATS GOIN ON"
Once again Netflix ruining a masterpiece by putting (Teela) as the protagonist when the main character should be HE-MAN!
OMG😂😂😂 i will olny watch this if they make him a power bottom like She-ra😂😂😂 omg😂😂PLEASE!!!
Ok... not gonna lie.. the end of the trailer gave me goose bumps " I have the power"
lol I'm just here for Mer-man :D
Look it’s she man and her girlfriend the New Masters of the Woke. Don’t be fooled people HeMan isn’t the main character it’s being taken over by Talia and her girlfriend it’s the old Last of Us 2 bait and switch.
now do thundercats
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I was 11 when it premiered the first time. Now I am 46 and I am as excited as the first time. I am gonna need new action figures ⚔
Animation looks good and all but eh missing that humor from the original series
At least it isn't cgi.
A big piece of shit with good sound effects to try to smother the production crap. Crap. Stop picking up old recipes and MISSING EVERYTHING. PLEASE STOP SPOKING IT ALL... MAKE YOUR OWN SHIT NEW.
Anybody else really like the new artstyle?
As long as they don't take another classic, and try to make it "woke" and PC by today's "standards", then it should be good.
Ik Theres 5 Episodes And Ik At Least One Will Not Have He Man Only A Nightmare Battle Including Him So Im Hoping 4 out of 5 Episodes Are fantastic
Hopefully this is just the way the trailer is set up but it feels an awful lot like He-Man is only in flashbacks and the final episode. Is this about reforging the sword of power to get him back?
Skeletor sounds amazing. This look promising. But He-Man sounds constipated.
I really hope this show doesn't take itself too seriously. At least have a little comedy in it.   Also where's Orko??
I have such a bad feeling about this just like the Lord of the Rings Amazon series. If they do happen to ruin it, they can’t erase the old cartoon from history!
If this is going to be as half as good as the She ra show was then I am in for a treat
IVAN EL TROLAZO HA VUELTO!
Everyone from my generation knows he man always sucked. It's kids stuff. GI Joe was always better. The cartoon was ok. Orko was funny.
I hope that they make Skelletor gay
In Eternia, you have to say good journey heman, good journey teela, good journey manatarms...I haaaaaave the poooooooWEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!
F#@% me and take all my money!
But let's be honest he forget his tune or they cut it out. It supposed to starts out with "By The Power of Grayskull!" 1:49
I got a feeling He-Man is going to be like Superman in the Justice League movie.
I am He-Man - Woman have the Powerrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!! - Bs woke
Looks at those skeleton. Damn
I still have concerns about the show. I don't want to see he-man as Prince Adam for the majority of the season. I'm here for He-man, not she-man Teela.
Mathemann der anime
hordak in this? have a suspicion
So apparently the sword's divided and now he man and teela share the power. ik everyone's not going to like this, but as long as teela is a good character, im perfectly fine with this, if not, then Netflix has a huge problem.
Judging from what they did to the character design skeletor's probably going to be the only saving grace for this series. An atom really needs to learn how to call upon the power of His bloodline without that sword.
*HEHEHEHHEHEH*
I loved „MotU“, watched the series, played with actionfigues, knew the stories but this looks like everything made these days. Females doing the hero stuff, males are weak, and … SkeleGOD … please guys. I pray these are just pessimistic thoughts and it will be awesome. But I fear it will be just what’s typical these days.
My favorite thing is how they changed every female character to have long skirts and more manly frames and faces, but kept every single male character almost exactly how they were in the 80s (nipples, thighs, and loincloths galore). Then we see that they will even further change the females with neato feminist haircuts and near full body suits. 2021 version of an epic fantasy show I guess.
I’m praying to see some gore!
I like the old school sword better …  Should have done a fan vote … maybe they did .  Who knows ??
THEY/ THEM !!!! BASTARDS OF THE UNIVERSE!!! WTF leave the boys MANLY heroes alone and make your own WIERDO worlds / heroes PHUK YOU PC WEIRDOS
After the blessing that was the She Ra reboot, I have pretty high hopes for this!
Mark Hamill is always a win
Looks awesome lilly buggy
Feeling nostalgic , thanks for giving us HE MAN again
Let's all take a moment to congratulate "Fisto" for making the cut!!!!
Okay I can’t be alone on this as a kid I always thought Greyskull belong to Skeletor, I mean it’s a castle the looks like the right fit for him.
Series or movie
Please cartoon gods, I beseech thee, let the story be as good as the animation. Please not another visuals over substance reboot.
I want to see he-man only
You know what would be cool……If they added the way the characters use to run 🏃🏼‍♂️ in this reboot…I use to luv how they would run and it would look like they ran over the camera…my childhood 😭
I just remember watching reruns at like 10 or 11pm as a little kid
Loved the teaser. Love the trailer. Bonnie Tyler brought me to the party but you've broken through my cynicism for my own childhood nostalgia. I'm excited to see this.
Masters of the Woke: Netflix Revelation
I don’t know, after Invincible this show has a lot to live up too. Let’s hope it’s not an SJW Woke nightmare 🤞
I mean if the show does center on Teela, and sidelines He-man, I won't be surprised. I'm sure Kevin Smith, or really any creative mind that wants to put something out to mass market media (such as Netflix) realize they have to follow the rules of the nu-progressive ideology. I can't say I blame them, I'm sure they don't want to have to deal with being harassed and vilified every day on social media for committing the unforgivable sin of having your show/movie based around a hetero white male.
This was supposed to be "He-man and the masters of the universe" they just lost he-man. I see much feminist agenda here, not watching it at all.
As a She-Ra "obsessed" fan, this is on my recommended!!!
Dull, mediocre animation and story. Bye
Why does Teela have to look like Rhea Ripley?
I like all of it except Teela's new haircut lol
I sense a whole new batch of skeletor memes brewing
I don't think I'm gonna like this heman cartoon. And I haven't even seen it yet. Lol
Teela is the main character.  ROFL.  Who is going to watch this crap?  I wanted HE-MAN.  Not TEELA.
I swear ive not been this happy to see a show in years XP thx to all who helped make it
You just know this is going to be some woke bs with Teela as the protagonist and He-Man showing up here and there.
From the same animators studio of Dragon Ball super?
Everything was good till "I got the power!"  It just have no way of being compare to the original without the echo
STINKOR’S IN THIS, I REPEAT, STINKOR’S IN THIS.
Y’all better not make he-man gay
Tamil la vantha Nala erukum
I am afraid about  democrashit party moves again a netflix show.
this iis cooler than it should have been. Damn
Trailer 1: The epicness of the original series that any 80s kid could have ever hoped for.   Trailer 2: Bait and Switch WOKE TRASH!!!!!
Please tell me Heman did not transform with rainbow colors!!!   Please anyone
Hyped
It's true what they say, you can't satisfy these people
is this going be gay like she ra doesn’t matter either way  Also is this in the same universe of she ra and are there relations to the show  I’m hoping it doesn’t so someone please respond
1:54 Goosebumps 🗡
Teela looks like Megan Rapinoe and every Karens love child after cutting her hair to become super duper woke champ!
I grew up watching  He-man and I gotta say this is awesome..
I CANT WAIT TO SEE ORCO
He-Man using a tong hehehehehe, I hate my imagination
So excited carnt sleep waiting for this
Let me guess... Feminist empowerment, lesbian hero, He-Man's heteropatriarchy dies with him in order to let feminism be something.
We need Frank Langella to voice skeletor
Oh wow... Please please please don't suck!!!!
This really s@cks extremely hard,just garbage.....😱😭😱
You woke zoomers are like the opposite of Midas touch. Whatever you touch turns intos $....hit. Generation X forever.
All I ask @netflix is that skelator and he-man last battle have the holding out for hero song in background !!
God, this comment section is so cancerous
This looks awesome, pity I don’t have Netflix:(
Something u can never forget
I really want a crossover with She Ra. Netflix, make it happen
Super. Ich freue mich drauf
Was n dreck... Diesen quotenmist brauch keine sau... Die 80er waren geil... Das hier zieht alles durch den dreck
Mark Hamill REALLY hit it off as being Skeletor Lord of Destruction, Alan Oppenheimer would be proud.
Why focus on teela This feels like making Sakura the protagonist in Naruto show
The nostalgia is overwhelming. I need to watch this
Who’s the warrior girl with the butch haircut,is that Teela?
This trash is not canon.
I need an episode dedicated solely to whether he-man hunts and kills an animal for that fur round his waist...or if he just grows his own 🩲
What is this about?
This is great and all but what the fans really want is a remastered Heyyaheyya.
Stinkor lives!
Nothings good as the orginal even the effects of the 1980s is better imo
Instead of Netflix releasing gay movies & shows daily. Just drop 1 season of this already.
Trailer rocks! Look forward to seeing his one
Knowing this isn't a reboot is a little more comforting, but I really hope they don't screw it up and make it Masters of the WOKE: The Teela Show. If it's done right, Kevin Smith and Netflix, may earn back some of my respect. Please, don't disappoint me!
Lets see if it is equal to the 2000 remake
GRINGO LOCO Y FUMONNN , NO ME LO PIERDOOO
Anyone here for Chris?….. no, just me
So like... Where's the manga??????
I have not been this excited for Netflix show since the dark crystal age of resistance!!!!
Eh, another failed he-man remake. Wrong tone, wrong color palate, wrong musical score.  Guys, it’s not hard.  Just update the animation, scripts, and music from the past. Pay the royalties and call it a day.
If heman is pushed to the side for shewoman , this will suck
Lest go he-man is back i been waiting for another he-man series I'm hype
I have the POWAAHH!!!!
He-Man playing second banana to Tela - so lame.
S K E L E T O R
As long as Netflix doesn't end this dirty like they did Voltron.................
Why is it that every female character that wants to act out always cuts their hair in that way? My first act of defiance is to shave my head! Yeah, that will show them!
Looking forward to Skeletor.
The more I see of this the more meh I feel... Smith screwed the pooch.
He-Woke
Teela gay haircut confirmed.
SAPEE
This was so awesome I nearly shed tears.
So Skeletor just impersonates Spikor at 1:34
MALAYALIKAL ondo evide enal like adi
Woke garbage. Bait and switch as always. Not sure how netflix is still alive. Santa clarita diet still keeps them afloat
Complaining about the lack of He-man in Masters of the Universe is like complaining that Captain America is not the Main Character in Avengers
thicc man
No senseless nudity? No Pedophilia? I’m shocked Netflix. This might be a winner.
By the power of Gayskull, She has the Powarrrrrr
Woke garbage!!!!
anime style he man? cool.
Ok Netflix.  Take My money and continue like this.  Well done.
Another remake?  So the lesbian space pirate plot didn't work?   Also, this looks like it was made by the makers of Castlevania?
I like how as he’s turning into He-Man there is a flash of blue, referencing Faker.
I was stoked for a re make of the original thanks to that first "I need a hero" tailor.. witch was a bate and switch.. but this looks good, I'll give it a try but there's so much back ground since it's fallowing the first show from the.. what 80's?
BATTLE CAT IS BACK BABEY!!!!!
Mathemann
Yo this is going to be awesome!  Can’t wait. With the origins line out too. Next generation of fans being made!
I'm looking forward to this, but seeing someone other than he-man use the sword, this is really getting on my nerves
The red eyed He-Man has to be Faker. I just hope they show him blue at some point
So this movie is sequel to the 1983 series of heman. OK but the characters look really different
I would have kept the original character design and look. Specially Teela.
Let's hope Netflix doesnt do us some woke She-Man BS...
Das ist ja mathepennermanntastisch!
I’m only watching bc of Mark Hamill TBH
Wow Netflix hat Mathemann kopiert
If this doesn't have "HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA", I'll be very disappointed.
Underwhelmingly Flat.
HEADLINE Should BE:  TEELA Comes out of the Closet AND The Masters of the Universe.
i won't watch this because you attacked one of my favorite webseries: MATHEMANN. HOW DARE YOU??!?
Think il wait for the spoiler reviews then if it's bad I won't have to destroy my childhood cartoon with trash (hoping it's good by the way) at least the teaser trailer was really good
ummmm I think is Theela and Master of the Universe 🤦🏽‍♂️... stop Netflix changing the cartoons, U are like Disney.
Why is Teela a dude? :(
MATHEMANN
Childhood ruined...
When She-ra does so bad you give people what they want
They didn't
Richtiger Mathemann Abklatsch
i look it didnt show this why
A show about a strong white blond man will NEVER be accepted in today's america.
what happened to the cross of his chest ???
Gess there will be a She Women with He Man and the Masters of the Universe🤔
The old version was much better.  (1981-1985)
I can’t believe the original Skeletor (Alan Oppenheimer) is in the cast but he’s voicing Moss Man and Mark Hamil is voicing Skeletor.
so he-man is evil? tilla and her new gf are the new heroes?and adam is a weekling again?
Im guessing they remake Conan the Adventurer after this,  the good thing is Arnold Still Alive...
*IT'S WOKE!!!!!*
they should play HEYEYEEYYE or else this show will suck
Whoa... HE MAN my man...   where is SHE RA
Ivaaaan soy un trolaso y me gusta el pedaso la la la la
1:48 lol.. if you want to make she-ra then make she-ra.. cuckgressive politics needs to stay out of my cartoons. Man of arms BEHIND karen here? really? gonna pass on this like i passed on avengers video game once the box art showed its true colors.
This looks terrible ngl.
The sword looks wrong.
I have the power
0:23  Oh wow, Prince Adam is really fem looking, so what's this person pronoun, are they gender fluid?  I'm asking cuz seeing how this show is going woke with identity politics of this decade with the race swapping (in this show) and gender nonsense bs.
The old HE MAN had a more powerful "I HAVE THE POWER" Voice. I was actually waiting for the call and it was a major let down.
Too bad the Netflix She-Ra series is so different from this. No chance of crossover
Dude wtf. Where’s the theme music???
As soon as I saw Netflix making this, I knew it was going to be a trashcan.
This is bull shit.
I'm in
I'm watching this for Roboto - c'mon, don't tell me you don't want to see "robots vs. zombies"!! :D
The new series better be true to the original material and not try to have any political messages or virtue signalling in it.
This is way more serious  then the He-man i grew up on back in 1983 it's great to see He-man and the masters of the universe again.
Welp this is going to be shit unless skeletor wins
So, Teela is the main star in the HeMan series? Sad.
Why do they always have to give women a manly haircut to make them look strong?  Also Teela was already a strong woman on the original show and it feels out of character for her to renounce her friends and family.  She would be mad at Adam for hiding the fact that he was He-Man but definitely would not abandon him because he was a close friend of his.  Also not a fan of killing He-Man and making the show about Teela.  Is it so hard to just make a serious show about He-Man without any woke mumbo jumbo?!  Also Prince Adam wasnt some skinny weakling but a strong man on his own before acquiring the Power of Grayskull. He was a bit of a playboy and flamboyant sure but never a weakling.  Prince Adam could bench press big weights and was pretty athletic as well, he was the son of a warrior King after all. When he aquired the Power of Grayskull he simply played out his more flamboyant side and hide his own strengths so no one would consider him being He-Man.  It's obvious Kevin Smith never saw the show or read the comics because anyone who did would know that Prince Adam is not some weakling but a caring man who did not want to worry his friends and family.  Prince Adam was a man who loved to have fun and the company of friends not a weakling.
All I can hear is Cersei Lannister
Eternia? Are they in the same universe as She-ra? 🤔
Battle cat can talk? 🤔
Thank god, its not gonna be in 3D like Knights of the zodiac
Every time, when you see a chick with a half shaved head, you know this show is doomed. How many times have they learn the same lesson. Get woke, go broke.
Looks like the Lefties will have their imprint on this in someway..
man, i know mark hamil will do a great job of skelator but all i here is batman arkham asylum
Mathemann! "Und ich liebe ... die Mathematik".
Buffy :)
Welcome to the Teela show. This is not He-man.
yikes he needs a new haircut
Oh, they used the "One sword in two" from John Blackstar!
So what are they going to do with SheRa now that this Masters of the Universe has made it clear that the swords were separated . This version of He-man resembles what people watched back in the day. I can’t imagine that they could tie together this version of He-man with new version of She-ra. The only way it could work is if they exist on parallel worlds and time lines. Am I wrong? Please get this noob some context.
Im watching this because i remember when it originally came out in 1983... I've been a huge fan ever since... except that movie version with Dolph... i mean i liked it, but upset at the sametime
Anyone else remembers the old toons & weird “I have the power” cringe
old school he-man is way better
netflix & hollywood are using >>HE-MAN<< to try to get people to watch 3rd rated character starred "Teela". Nobody knows or care who she is & there is no Man of Arms in this Netflix Version of He-Man. Waist of money like the other dogpile of crap shows
I hope they bring Hordak and Hiss back into the pic.
Divided ? Awe shit. Teela is gonna be sharing the sword with he man 🙄🙄🙄🙄
..seriously? Original He-Man ruleZ! This one s*cks... Change my mind!
I was hoping to hear that legendary trailer music from the old series.....hope they put the music in the series.
Kevin Smith lied. It’s sad what he’s become 😔
Gayflix... STOP SHITTING POLITICAL CRAP PLEASE!!!!
Mark Hamill? MARK HAMIL!  I didn't watch in the 80's. I watched the Batman series. But... now more MARK HAMIL?!  I'm in!!
Do u now a 10/10 game named TLOU? Here we are.
I hope it doesn't suck
A lesbian? No thanks. Too liberal
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Is Mark Hamill voicing Skeletor?
This looks so stupid.    I've watched it like 20 times trying to love it...  But "He-Teela" just hold no interest to me.
As someone who never saw the 80s cartoon but was introduced to He-man through the 2002 series I think this definitely has potential to be awesome
THE PIZZA HE-MAN, EAT IT
Still... MEH!?!
demn, kurt cobain got ripped
Im just gonna watch it to see skeltor say jokes on you im in to that shat and make a "new" meme format
Please redo she ra properly too in the same way!!!! This looks amazing!!! 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
This show will be about Teela and her girlfriend.
Skeletor is the only guy that can get away with saying:"I boned a girl last night"
maybe my memory is fualty  but wasnt  the sword always  split ? and if i remeber right  didnt  skeletor  have the other half  of the  sword  to begin with ?  or i am  just  rembering it wrong ?
Can't have a toxic masculine character like heman  be the main character of heman can we? Just going to be some chick
i just want to see the dislike to like ratio once it's out
Unless Allen Oppenheimer is the voice of Skeletor it won't be the same
Adam was not weak on the original series.. but now he is shown skinny and he-man with muscle protruding out.. teela never had muscles  in original that she was brave and athletic but now she looks like man.. why they want to project there idea by showing men weak and skinny and women muscular and strong. They can create there own series for that instead of tampering with fan loved series and changing the plot
He has the power!!!
at the start it sounds like morgana from trollhunters
"Still know the tune?"  My head be like: HEYEAYEAYEAYEA
This looks horrible... I already feel ashamed for binge watching all the episodes...
So he would say "hey yeah yeah yeah" ?
An oldschool animation with Japanese anime fighting style
Old is Gold... New is EWW
Hey Netflix, is there any hope for "BEN 10"
Ngl im nervous for this. Also I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who thought “for eternia” had like no emotion in it
I'm getting scared. Where the heck is Orko?
BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!
Skeletor is the Powwa
They saw a black and female character, and the comments section decided they already know this is gonna be "hollywoke". Fuckin hate it here
This will be bad, trust me.
They have a new character. Appearing in the show called "REACH-A-ROUND"....
Bout time 😊
The old bait and switch…
Ah...so they had to sneak in one of those "strong" characters....sigh~
Wow. Our childhood!
Is Skeletor going to have a pleasant day?
I'm really hype for skeletor's "Just like a woman" line, it's going to be epic.
Not even hyped anymore knowing the fact that he-man isn't even the main character in his own series because of some stupid political disagreements
I thought I saw two swords...does this mean she-ra will make an appearance?
welp, I never thought I would be simping for teela but here I am.
Looks like 200X version with less interesting story.
Eternia is on lockdown. Wear a mask wash your hands.
Now my childhood real hero is back 😍 I don't care much other series anymore. I said, "much".
The "This is for Eternia" line was delivered SO FLAT.  UGH.
He should have said "By the power of Greyskull" instead. But even so, this actually looks like alot of fun. The old one never interested me that much, as a kid, even if i can acknowledge its historya and nostaliga.
Wow, I'm down for this...
I hope they don't screw this up...it had better be about He-Man and not "The Teela Show".
Is that Lena Headey doing the voice intro??
was it me or you all waited for the He-Man to scream his power!!
It’s all woke bull.  Disgusting show. Characters all appear to be evil with evil rebellious up talking attitudes.   G A R B A G E.
I smell feminism here. Looks like She-Woman and Masters Of The Universe.
Woooooo
I would race home from school every day to watch He-Man!
Although I've hype for watching this, nothing beats the Skeletor from the 80's. Classic evil laugh.
Feminist  he Man?
She-Ra cameos, plox!
1:03 Its a MA'AM???
Einzige was mich stört ist dieses sichbare manga mäßige was es asiatisch wirken lässt
sick
This better not be some woke bs.
The memes shall rain
The best character in this series was Skeletor..
There was a report that they will side line he-man
i think netflix is against men for some reason, do we scare you or something?
HE have returned; as a MAN.
Ai nesse trailer a dublagem original ficou melhir
Mark Hamill's skeletor voice sounds like a mix between Alan Oppenheimer and Brian Dobson.
Super 😀
viu, netflix, ta passando dos limites, gente, que isso, pow, to arrepiado aqui, caraca, coloca logo no ar e lança logo o jogo hehehe
How nice of them to make Price Adam a scrawny twerp.  Just screams feminism and emasculation.  Hollywoke…. POS garbage.
I heard a rumour Heman and Skeletors male toxicity destroys something and whatever that thing portraying Teela and her band of woke warriors has to fix it! So I'll give ot a miss thanks!
Hmm. The first trailer had me thinking this is gonna be badass. I dont care if netflix makes him Vegan. This trailer has me leaning towards meh
Apparently He-Man will die early, which honestly sucks... BUT Since it's called " Masters of the Universe " and not " He-Man and the Masters of the Universe " I dont feel tricked into watch this.  Hopefully he does not die to early :(
The only toy hero we grow up with.
feminists are destroying the society...
i’m not really excited to watch something that’s gonna be trashed with forced LGBT, forced fem, and forced diversity in this show.
It's called he-MAN not he-woman.
dont think that i am going to like this too much, but, im still gunna watch it all coz of, come on, its he man, you just have to, even tho its probably gunna be a bunch of woke shit :S :(
My first SuperHero He-man ❤️❤️
The last scene gives me goosebumps.. my childhood hero..😍
Tri-Klops was always an interesting character I wish I saw more of on the original show. In this, not so much. I hate his look, and he seems to be some leader of a cult of his own. Weird.
Team LBTQ-Squad!
I pray whoever reads this should become successful. keep l for success. the rich stay rich by spending like the poor and investing why the poor stay poor and be spending like the rich yet not investing. Roar! Invest earn and be successful.
We dont want she man
If I don’t get he man I’m moving to prime
If this show makes He-Man (and/or his father black) than I'm gonna skip this garbage.
Who remembers of  Dolph Lundgren Masters of the universe ... He was the guy who fought Sylvester Stallone in Rocky II
Wow, this MOTU is super WOKE with a butch Teela and a bitch Prince Adam!  Grrrl Power! 🤣
So this wont be He-Man, more like She-Man !
Well they did it, these evil fucks even managed to make He-Man woke. I’ll stick to 80’s He-Man, back when stories were written for entertainment, not identity politics.  Rot in Hell Netflix and your woke staff!
Por el orto XD
By the power of gryskull
*nope. Not watching this liberal sjw bull spit butchering the classic He-Man*
How did all He man fans grow up to be racist and afraid of women? Weird.
poor animation... dissapointing
IS THAT *MARK HAMILL* AS MR. _I AM NOT NICE!_ HIMSELF??
Is this gonna be a continuation?
I kind of get the feeling that the Dolph Lundgren Movie will be a masterpiece of art by mankind compared to this.
Still disappointed, the original He-Man was much manlier than the Teela in this.(who is the manly one in this show)  Edit: watched the first episode 😂😂😂 i am not even angry now, it’s just plain stupid, should be named “Teela : the angry princess, the mistress of universe” even worser than expected. On top of all that they killed He-man twice🤣🤣 stupidity of it all, thinking the fans would love it.
My hope is they find a way to have both He man and Teela be equally focused without either being sidelined. I'm just trying to find a bright side to this so let's just give it a chamce
Soy un trolazo, me gusta el pedazo, lalalala
Soy boy remake
For the simple fact that this show is made by the same crew who brought us Castlevania, I'm already sold.
This might tide me over until Drac is back...
I hope Teela teaches he-man that his toxic masculinity is not okay and that he should stop acting so manly because it's not right
Bait & Switch
The fact Netflix is doing this proves they lack any self awareness on top of a complete lack of creativity.
Don't expect too much 🙄 these are sad times. You lefties ruined name calling remember??!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
So....... Lesbianism saves Eternia??!!! Nope!!??
for the first time the secret identity of He-man could be a secret. xD
Looks cool, but I'm getting tired of every cartoon having the for no reason powerful butch chick with the undercut
So... Not a companion to She-Ra?
I don't know why but I wanna see He-man and She-ra fighting together .-.
Mark Hamill as Skeletor... Say no more.
Netflix just did a bait and switch on us. There was next to nothing about the danger haired chick in the initial teaser. The teaser was mostly pure He-Man nostalgia. Now they're showing us their intentions. He-Man will be a second fiddle on Masters of the Universe. Show could still be good, but the trick they just pulled is obvious, a little devious, and entirely predictable.
This looks like an adaptation of 1983 He-Man and Shera: Secret of the Sword esp when "power of sword destroyed, No, it's divided"
The animation level is to low
80sss to  2021 ..... Welcome back.. He Man..... Love you
Great art and execution, but the voice actors are so off for me.
Imagine removing Xena is the 1st episode of Xena reboot and replacing her with Yolas the whole series.
I believe that seires it is not about He-Man. It is about Teela. She will be the hero. He-Man, She-Ra, Skeletor, Witch and the others. They are the Master of Universe. I Understand they lose they Power that makes things goes wrong. Teela has to restore She is the daughter of the Sorceress. And Netflix Please make a good job portuguese too.
Ok I will give it a chance. The tomboy in me loved this as a kid. I watch the old shows late night if they show them too.
lena headey, gods gift to villainy!
I'm liking this Cringer
I hope the opening music is fabulous secret power...
As vozes tavam perfeitas antes, conseguiram cagar, tava bom demais pra ser vdd
goosebumps.   NO Avenger No Justice League .. Theres the Legend....... HE-MAN
It had better have the right intro music!, 😡
Where is the tiger??
HEY MAN, WE CAN SEE THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE IN ARGENTINA ???
İts He-Man
It kills me how Netflix knocked it out of the park with Voltron Legendary Defender and it looks like they're going to do it again with this...but then for Transformers, we get the hugely flawed War for Cybertron trilogy.
Cringe
So it’s not about he man.
Hmmm,so He Man is under a spell here(can't be Faker),and nothing new about Teela she always acted manly in the old show..so based in the title revelations..all characters dark secrets'll come out?lol.
More like Master of the Universe: Teela becomes a LGBT Karen
_Didn't see a drop of blood - This leads me to a serious questioning - The masters of the universe and an animation made for adults or for children ..? - Because if it's for adults it will be a total failure because of childishness like the animated series Guardioes da galaxy .. Only my opinion friends_
A lesbian will never replace He-Man. F* you, Weirdoflix
1:07 PACATO ♥️♥️♥️
watching 80's kids get mad over reboots is the funniest shit ever
Needs more gay she-ra!
She-ra crossover when?
How many over here today.... were present 30yrs ago for the Creeping Horak!
He-man becoming the villain is so disappointing. Modern culture making white men the villains as usual.
Is there a good in-universe explanation as to why Teela looks like a man now and has that haircut?
Looks like Ken Masters... Of the universe.
How about you remove woke wannabe garbage, remove race, remove sexuality and just let He-Man be He-man?
Wow! more news keeps dropping on this, apparently this is a valid attempt at ruining a child hood favorite.
Anybody else getting _ThunderCats_ reboot vibes from the animation style?
More woke garbage. Gonna pass on this.
They only gave him one line in the trailer, but from it we all know one thing for sure:  Mark Hamill is having *_fun._*
This better not be WOKE- MAN !
I need dragon booster series 🥺 please ❣️ any one else
I honestly hope they come out with thunder cats lol
Smells like crap
What a bait and switch.
This looks f'ing stupid. Why is Adam younger than he used to be....
I see a women reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1:56 i heard "i have the PAAAAAAAAAAAA"
The disrespect to the main character ... it ... it hurts me, man.
Absolutely AMAZING visual style!!!! Great it's not awful 3D or anime shit!! Also it does look like it's not going to be violent, as many other projects these days!
ok where is the music?
Teaser had me HYPED!!!  Teela's hair cut in this one has me worried.....
Lol.  F this woke garbage
how I have missed you need to do thundercats
okay so why is it not about Adam trying to get back the power sword.
No way bro. Where is skelator's old voice?
adam?
I'm offended he should be called He-Person in 2021
oooh a more serious He-Man series, Good! I'm way older so it fits! looking forward to it! :D
I am waiting for the series in Tamil
I'm gonna say it...  Skeletor looks the best!!!
Damn...I'm seriously disappointed...the filmation entrance and the amazing vibe of heman is missing..just another cartoon for me, the original heman still beats this series to dust
I am big big fan of heman ❤️ Childhood favourite 💪
So He-man is now Woke-man... nothing. is. safe.
i was looking for this show, nostalgia and the animation seems like a waste due to being more woke shit, what a shame.
Can't wait till this is on Pirate Bay 👍
Please bring  back Mummies Alive
That's a lot of magical stuff for a planet that is about to run out of magic 🤣🤣
meh
it looks so good
Me watching the Teaser: Ohh sht it looks good. Me watching the Trailer: I don't know Jimmy! It looks like another Netflix's woke BS.
Childhood memory ❤️❤️❤️
Netflix ruins another adaption
Por favor Netflix,  leva essa até o final. Se não  tiver certeza,  nem começa 🙄🤪
This about to be epic!!!
Bro this better be an actual good reboot unlike the other one. I mean the Thundercats reboot was good but went to shit after season 1 cuz they got knock off infinity stones
Gen X Snowflakes: Oh no! This is just She-Ra 2.0!  Me: Yeah, because clearly the tone and art style are so much like that show
Terrible animation, the original art was better 50 years ago...
A random weeb: -ANIME IS ONLY JAPPANESE- american anime:
Whyyyyyy u keep ruining our childhood hero
I'll admit, this looks really good.
НИЧОСЕ,  БАТЮШКА, ЭТО ЖЕ ХИИИИИИИИИИИИИИМЭЭЭЭЭЭЭЭЭЭЭН!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
plot: teela is gay
I thought this bombed and was cancelled already...
LET THE HEEEEYA MEME REIGN ONCE AGAIN
Hate this shitty feminist style hair cut every damn female character gets now.
Im glad this trailer is more truthful to the take on the series they are going with for this than the last one but i think ide still prefer he-man to be the main focus
I was worried for a minute. They can do popular content? Noooo! Wait.... Yes! Yesssss. Destroy that crap to hell and bury so no one will even know what he-man was. God speed Netflix.
Só não gostei da voz e da gargalhada do esqueleto, original da tradução brasileira é iniqualavel.
teela show , race swapped grey skull , he-man cucked and sidelined in his own show ...sounds solame keeping my netflix membership canceled this aint anywhere near good enough to bring my buisness back ...sucks cause it had potential just from nostalgia alone for me
I'm not going to get my hopes up..it does look pretty badass
"You still know the tune?"  "Of course, it's 2021.  🎵 What a girl wants, what a girl needs....🎵"
So the unnecessarily  lesbian character in this adpatation appears to be  tee-la
He-Man is not the main character in this trailer. I knew the first trailer was too good to be true. More woke Hollywood trash inbound.
TEELA AND THE MASTERS OF UNIVERSE
Die haben reingekackt was ist das für ein Müll alle meine Träume zerstört
Please make a Sereis in Phantom Comic Character Animated Sereis ❤️🙂🙏
Of course they have to make a female
Isn't teela supposed to be he mans mom and look queenly and sounds grandmotherly?
Well shouldve known this was coming eventually
Oh my childhood...is real time too see
So you have a she ra series where she isn't sidelined but with the he man series you decide to sideline him you know I had hope
Wasn't there a 2000's reboot? Why can't they just pick up from where that stopped? Seriously, enough of the 80's reboots.
Lmao
He-man is using PEDs. He should be cancelled.
I have the WOKENESS!!!!!   Btw. I love this androgyn looking Prince Adam   Makes my D hard.
Etheria is better
I heard Jay and Silent Bob will replace He-Man
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
heyeyayayayayayayyayeyaya
Tamil
Damn race swapping has spread to Eternia too.
He man fan's  👨😭🤣
I was about to comment 'Isn't that He-Man?'. Come on
Mathe Mann!
The old animation was better.
Heman is best...I m heman
I see people worrying about the story focusing more on Teela then He-Man. Gonna be honest, why does it matter?  So long as the story kicks ass, I'll take any protagonist. Yes, even Fisto.
Jeez that old man at the beginning took a hard ass fall that I could feel lol.
All I’m waiting for is thundercats…. Then I can die!
Strong "He-man will be a secondary on his own show" vives here
This is more likely a Teela show than a He-man series, but the art looks good.
This is going to be woke garbage.
Pretty much like everything today.   If it’s escapist and not infusing the politics of our world into the he man reality. The fans will not argue and the show will be respectful of he source material and original.   If they try to inject today’s political arguments into a franchise and change something people adore….you are simply asking for a fight and  are being disingenuous like Kevin smith who is pretending now like he is a life long he man fan,.   I guess he was too stoned to remember he did an interview saying he was never a he man guy …….maybe he doesn’t remember he didn’t watch he man lol.    I used to love Kevin smith.  What happened.   I don’t take a side left or right.    I am a physics guy who simply doesn’t care about humans lol.   If I did care it would be to balance the equation of a social control system.        Just let me go to a movie to relax again please  .  I don’t want to be preached to by either side.  That’s not fun, it’s church lmao.          You are both sides are wrong in ways most are to stupid to ever know….  Left ,right. You are both being played , and playing the part designed for you.     To all those who feel oppressed, you should remember one thing.   These corporations that pretend to care about …….only care about one thing …money.    By changing a white character black is not giving you a prize , it is simply mocking you by giving you a hand me down character , a tokenization……and laugh as you shell out money for such a cheap change.      Real change would be Disney working hard to create new. Characters, franchises , and stories with minority characters…….hard work.   They just press a button and you can turn a white animation black lol… Also if you think it is okay to hijack a character to say make him gay (and I have no problem with gay characters).  You must remember if you are changing a character who has been around for 100 years , people love his character., want this character….respect and have paid for this character for years.      His story is based around his traits and by changing his sexuality you are also fundamentally changing the story.     If you think it is okay to come into a character or franchise that people love and entirely undo what has been done and remake it in your image.  You ARE SIMPLY A SPOILED ASSHOLE and should reconsider calling others names for not being okay with these changes.    Don’t steal a character others love…..make a new one how you want it. And if people like your work they will buy it .       The problem is with a lot of these race-swapped characters in marvel comics today that makes it even worse for fans is that these changes also came with a drastic dip in the stories being told too….the writers have become more concerned with politics than actually crafting a well thought out story…..”.  If you were still making great stories more people would be able to eventually accept these race or sexual presence swapped. Characters if we were still getting great stories.    But it is obvious these two problems go hand in hand
Its a shame that it is going to turn into She-man.  I thought that is what She-ra is for.  Once again, agendas instead of the story how it was originally written.  Disappointing.
Some one please get swatkats and Centurians back like this.
How many of need this in tamil ! Let Netflix know's that !😁✨
If I’m gonna be honest, I’m only watching this for Mark Hamill as Skeletor and Orko 🤷
Looks like Teelas show .... Another white male that can't be the main character in his own show. Another franchise destroyed by ideology and politics?
It does not feel the same. And Adam is on Keto diet is it? He-man no longer in bob cut N looks like Super Saiyain. Teela got Attitude now. What have u done Netflix??
More ruining 80s childhood memories with wokeness.
Aww man, i'm gen z, but i remember watching the old he-man reprises on Gloob when i was like 7, and i love the new she-ra, oh my gaaaaaw  aaaaaaw maaaaaan
Id like the final beem just like She ha
Just please don't force feed us with sjw crap and ruin it.
WTF is this shit?
I HAVE THE POWER>>> AVENGERS ASSEMBLE
I think everybody knows this is gonna be some woke girl power lez sht
I grew up with MOTU. I really want to see this because the animation looks amazing. Unfortunately, I'll pass because I am almost positive that Netflix will cram wokeness into it and shit all over it because they can't help themselves. He-Man will kiss Man-At-Arms, Teela's black friend will be killed by the Eternia police department, Skeletor will be a trans paraplegic who teaches critical race theory and the King implement mandatory vaccines for all of Eternia declaring whoever isn't vaccinated is a follower of Hordak.
Prince Adam looks small!! All's good until you make He-Man as a side character or an antagonist.
Seems way too  much about Teela for a show called He-man, just saying.
He Man The Masters of The Universe.
This show better talk down to He-man for toxic masculinity and showTeela defeating him in combat otherwise male viewers will get the wrong impression. It's critically important that men are educated through this show that they can't push women around anymore!!!
They took a beautiful character like Teela and then changed her into a man.
Prepare yourselves. Its going to be another virtue signaling, alphabet person mockery of a classic. It will get cancelled after one season.
The sword don't have gender  and skeleton is multi trans gender, the subverted social engineering continues full speed ahead and the programmed ZZZZZZZZOMBIESZZZZZZZZZZZZZ love IT at click of humanity great RESET AKA extinction,ask thanos or everything that came FROM techno Bolshevik Hollywood LOLOL.ZZZZZZZZOMBIESZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
This looks shit
Yoo tengooo ell poderrrr!!!
The new He-Man
This looks awesome 👍😊
So, that is Faker. He-Man has blue eyes, not red.
Teela has a destiny too, not just Adam.
I would've cast Seth Green as Cringer
He-man I saw this in cartoon network
This looks hell of alot better than she ra and im not just saying that because its girl he man. This has way better animation and it looks like its actually enterntaining
im just happy they FINALLY figured out that Prince Adam should be a scrawny looking tike and THEN get big ass hulk muscles as He-Man - that part bugged me even back in the 80's - like come on! who doesn't know that they are the same damn person! At least put on a hat or pull a Clark Kent and get some glasses or something! LOL
ANIME>CARTOON
SHE-MAN. Making the Prince weak af while the Wahmen are strong and can win the war by themselves. Please ppl from the left just finish me off and shoot me down. I’m so tired of your BS. Keep destroying my childhood and don’t create anything new by yourselves.
SHE-MAN - A world where Wahmen talks like men and wants to be men and then becomes a man and at the same time talks men down.
❤️🤟
Wahmen speaking like they own everything and they are womansplaining to me. This might be absolute bs this SHE-man here.
Looks like the focus is really on a very masculine Teela.
I like to remember one thing. He-man is about he-man, not teela.
I-van recauchutado
legend
he man is BUFF
yesss! I hope they bring more of these retro cartoons to life again, thundercats,silverhawks ect.
No she-ra in this series? We'll give you Teela instead she's way more badass now! 😑
a velha fonte
Please don't have any forced politics in this, never seen Masters of the Universe but it looks good
So I guess He-Man is now going to be renamed Bitch-Boy so Stormfront's cosplay Teela can look good?
shuould do a remaster of Thundercats too
Da werden Kindheits Erinnerungen wach.Danke dafür.War eine schöne Zeit damals
Nah I'll leave it. Theres something off about it
He man is WHITE! Not black. This is WOKE broke show.
Kevin Smith trying to make up for his Harvey Weinstein connection this is going to be super woke and a joke
That moment when you press "like" and you see the 99k turning to 100k
HELL YEAH!
Hello, people. Please, Game job PC.  Здравствуйте, народ. Сделайте, уже пожалуйста, ДОСТОЙНУЮ Игру по Этому МУЛЬТСЕРИАЛУ. ПК / PC, XBox, PS...
Does anyone know if the man in the dark cloak is supposed to be Man At Arms/Duncan with long hair now or is it King Randor? The beginning of the video shows Man At Arms/Duncan with short hair.
... for the He-Man  show without He-man
"I have the power!" No.
They-Person and the Diverse Community of the non-Intelligently Designed Universe!
He Man looks gay....
this is all lies the show a lie i lost my hype see them give the sword of power to her and heman just accepted it
its a continuation of SHE-RA?
I hope they didn't ruin He-man witj that woke b.s.
They better not F@CK this one up like they did with the new Shera series.
It’s the laughing skull from that scooby doo meme....
It looks epic, I hope it is going to be epic!
Shades of the old school cartoon Blackstar with the sword split?!? 🤔
Tee-la, mastress of the universe?
Era para a she-ha ser assim neste formato....
1:55 when i find my phone charger 🔌
He-Man i gospodari svemira! 💪💪💪💪♥️
If this Show goes about Teela, I'll quit Netflix for ever.
OMG

Weeeeeeee
She-women and the Masters of the Universe
Is it 2002 series continuation under the same title?
Y am I getting a woke signal? Women being a bad ass ...I am more than happy wit it.But please don't ruin it by saying men r stupid and worthless and so require a gender fluid women to save him.
Cant wait to see someone made HEYAHEYAHEYA the remastered version. Its going to be glorious
Prometedor... sólo espero que no echen a perder esta historia con la ideología de genero que Netflix suele inyectar en sus series.
I forgotten he-man n Shazam was similar to the summoning of powers
If i find out the HEY song is in this then i’m watching the episode
He Man looks almost disfigured with how bulky he is lol
'2:48' 🤣 Ok that is the best: *INJAPP*; 🌶️ disregard others they're BS 📌
I pray this isn't hot, woke garbage.
Y los thundercants pa cuando?
Of course this will be a woke propaganda as usual.
Woah!
Hearing her voice, Lena Headey would make a good (live-action) Evil-Lyn
Will not be a big surpise if Teela and Sorceress make a romantic couple is this SAGA.... NetFlix being NetFlix.
Adam is scared of the masculine Teela...netflix is shitting all over the real fans....
HE - MAN
Kids, lets travel back to 90's...
I was searching for the warrior song project and this was recommended to me. Based
Trash
പഴയ He-Man ആണെന്ന് മനസ്സിലാക്കിയവർ ലൈക്ക് അടിക്കു'
I can't F@cking wait. . .😆👊💥💯
This trailer make it seem the focus gonna be on the female. Please don't. Its he man and the master of the universe not she man if that happen no more netflix for me its either focus on gay or feminism
Another typical looking trailer...
I don't know why they adapt He-Man into a badass action fantasy series when the original was a trippy lighthearted adventure series.
Eternia is clearly having issues with magic because they didn't save at MoneySuperMarket, therefore doesn't feel epic.
Up Next: *Thunder.. Thunder... THUNDER CATS* HOOOO!
I can't wait. "Güç bende artık!"
Why isn't it allowed anymore for a female character to look like a female character? Why must Teela be the male part of a lesbian couple? 🤮
Voll geil!
"HE MAN" is my childhood cartoon
Skeletor say overlord of evil not lord of destruction, someone know if this new show will be better then the first show that came out in 2002?
Please... for the love of all that is decent, no woke messages... no gratuitous representation... no progressive talking points. Just give a good story and some good animation that everyone can appreciate.
woke shit ! series is not destroyed its divided ! xD
Just tell the truth: This Show is She-man, and the main character will be Teela
Well, this looks like a bag of ass.
Feminist trash. You can keep it.
Kevin smith’s wife’s boyfriend is going to be really disappointed when he finds out about this
He has the power!   ... and the nipples
히맨? 오우
Honestly, why do so many people just want... He-man with better artwork?  The original was a one dimensional kids show.  We don't do those anymore.  Why are so many people so surprised that this is going to be a little different?  I'm excited for it.  Hope others are too.  Side Note: A+ for bringing Skunk Man into this.
നമ്മുടെ 'He Man' nostu
NETFLIX i love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brace yourself for some woke BS coming your way.
Get ready for HeMan to pass the torch...
They made a stupid and effeminate Adam prince, while Teela is rebellious and mannish.... This has everything to go wrong.
He gonna came out the closet as like revelation? In anycase im always a fan
If it becomes true and teela turns out to be the main hero.  Doubt many will care about this.  Already the women look like Amazons. I remember movies like Alien where Ripley was a bad ass and did not look like an Amazon.
Thalaivaaaaa 😍😍😍😍 ரேஸ்கள் கோட்டையின் சக்தி  என்னோடு இருக்கும் சக்தியே......🔥BgM poduU bGm PodU💥
They removed the "He-Man"  from the title. I guess we all know where this is going...
im kinda dissapointed that there was no oryginal he-man opening in this trailer, but still hyped xd
Love the original.. but this looks good to
I hope this get all SJW. Please leave my childhood alone, hope this is not a Tela show
Awesome sward replace by trash, so suck. Booo boo
The pathetic underwear phytogeographically supply because barbara microregionally test on a ruddy sing. imminent, fluffy bassoon
കൊച്ചു ടീവിൽ ഹീ മാനേ കണ്ട് വളർന്ന മലയാളീ പിള്ളേർസ്.. ഇങ്ങു പോരെ..
Looks so good. Can't wait to see how all those goofy weirdo characters get updated into a mature story line. So exciting.
Still know the tune? Somethings you never forget....  Doesnt play the tune everyone remember. Kevin Smith you goddamn troll.
Good attempt nice story line but you lost the passion from the original .  Keep trying Netflix
After 1:15 I can stand no more! Rename this pos mistress of the universe and it'll be closer to truth, you have sullied he-man and tried to supplant him with Tela as the protagonist. Netflix dun f-ed up. I won't be watching this train anytime soon.
In this series King Grayskull, He-Mans ancestor, is a black man.  They race swapped the white blond ancestor (which makes far more sense) into a black guy because they stated they didn't need anymore white people in this series. They intend to slowly introduce more and more non-white new characters as well.  This series, beloved as it is, has fallen into the hands of anti-white demons filled with hatred of white people.
Chris Hemsworth will make a great He-Man!
This show is gonna suck, I wanted to watch a show about He-man not Teela
Somehow this whole bit about saving magic reminded of kung-fu panda 2, you know..."but I JUST got kung-fu and now you must save it!"  Seriously though, I pray they don't ruin this old classic.
The voice at the beginning of the trailer. I could swear is Lena Headey (Sersei Lannister). 🤷🏽‍♂️
so politics catch up to he-man, becosue there is basicly no he-man in he-man show, just teela doing stuff around
Sarah Michelle Gellar as Teela? I'm in.
MUST MISS!
Where's the portuguese pt br version?
You actually mean He-Man is still a buff straight white male? CANCEL
Like Tyrone Magnus say it, WOOUUU! ~
The trailer is misleading.  He-man is only a secondary character in this new series.  You'll all notice once you start watching it.  It's "woke" just like everything else.  Don't watch this expecting any resemblance of your childhood, but you can expect at least 1 homosexual relationship, some gender swapping, and critical race theory elements added in that have nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.
Who else is looking forward to the HD remake of "HEYYYYYAYAYAYA"
Heman
Why does Teela look like a butch lesbian now? Is this He-Man show actually about He-Man?
I don't like this choppy animation.
Gay
I remember as a kid, I used to wake up and miss the show and could only watch the ending few minutes
Please Netflix, don't SJW this. Please make it true to the original.
Childhood memories
Its HE-MAN
He-Man 😍
He-man as villain? If this is going to be teela and the masters of universe im going to give it a big pass
Wish someone made a 3D animated series.  'He-man and the Masters of the Universe' ......best childhood memories.
Kreskal kottayin Sakthi... enakul irukum sakthiyaeeee!!!!
1:06 Cringer design is so great, it's like Mufasa from The Lion King, also like the voice acting and the fact Cringer is saying that :)
40 years... and you make the He-Man return about _Teela_. Thanks Netflix, but I'll wait for the next one. Hard pass.
IMO  I want this Masters Of The Universe series should be Rated R.
Too bad the show will have little to do with the title character and more to do with Teela
I´m not gonna lie, I hate Teela's new look. It's like another complete different character, is not Teela anymore.
It’s a shame She Ra  didn’t get the same animated treatment.
I'm 45 & I'm not gonna lie, the 12yr old me is geeking out big time watching this trailer.
الكرتون القديم احلى بكثير
Aww this is gonna SUCK!? Why!?!?!
Something's you can never forget ❤️
She man ...I am so sick of all this gender bs. It’s f HE man. No one is down for cancel culture I hope. Looked good but seem like the girl will till the alter. Meh no offence I love women but serious bs
He man
Skelegod(PAS):"What sorcery do You think You're doing?" Skeletor(Filmation):"To make a proper plot, You Bumbling Skywalker Boob!!!" Skelegod(PAS):"Watch Your tongue, You Flesh-Face Liar!!!"
where is 'i need a hero?' where is 'what's up?'
This new trailer gives off all sorts of red flags. Wtf is up with that Teela haircut.
Que raro que esto lo haya permitido el feminismo :S
Those who had goosebumps when you heard the magic word "I have the powerrrrr" are  the true HE-Man fans of the 80's.
So the teaser trailer was indeed bait, and Teela now looks like a sjw... Thx Netflix!
I hope there's some kind of video game, to be made based upon this series!! I have an enamel pin of He Man and Battle Cat, adapted from this series.
where is the his ride?????
Netflix is gonna change this into SHE-MAN😂💯💯
Why the intro voice seemed to be of cersie Lannister
If this focuses more on Teela than He-Man, let's just say Eternia is better off dead.
SHE-MAN and the Woke Folks of the Universe (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
Now that I know about them making he man's  grandfather a black man..... I will never watch this woke crap.  Full boycott mode on this.
This looks awful. It has the generic euro accent, lines uttered as a question the first half statement second half...looks awful. "Whatever became of Eternia? we'll face it." - He Man. "Being a hero? swallows you whole." - Tela.
Ivan el trolazo...
Its 90s kids super hero🔥🔥.... Love from kerala♥️
She-man and the masters of simp. Not watching.
Looks rubbish. Thundercats 2011 was better
Hmm.. not impressed🚶🏾
See Netflix,.. you should have done Transformers War for Cybertron in this style of animation!!!
5fps again meh
The tawdry packet reversely strengthen because course allegedly match vice a brown camera. actually, juvenile brain
Too bad woke as a demonic joke had to be the one to make this.  No thanks.  In Christ, Andrew
Doesn’t look good.
DOWNTOWN GRIFFY NEWMS!
I still know the tune... that wasn't it.
Can't wait to watch this and tired of the whinners
Seriously, He Man? Lmao
Friendly reminder that the showrunner is NOT a he-man fan
Imagine making a He-Man show without He-man...... $20 says they just turn it into another Teen Titans Go slapstick fart joke like they did with She-Ra
Manly teela?…teela was strong and smart, no big muscles on her..why do you so annoyed by Classics that have heterosexual mens and femenins womans?..🤮🤮
I have finally found THE reason to subscribe Netflix
Is that female voice in the beginning of trailer sersai from GOT?
HE MAN IS BLACK NOW!! 💪🏾
Is it true? Is Teela a lesbian?..
😴🙄👎🏼 - He-man willl NEVER!!! be the same without john erwin the original he-man voice 👍🏼
More like He-Wahman and the Barbie's Simp Ken doll side plot character
Another memory ruined. Thanks a ton, woke Netflix.
This looks good but it better not turn into another super woke trash show where the main male character is weak and can't do shit and he needs a strong "waman" to save him. I'm so sick of seeing "strong" female characters that constantly belittle and try to make the man look like trash while she gets to stand on a pillar of virtue. How about we have strong male and female roles that compliment each other without trying to make one of them look inferior to the other for once. But hey who am I kidding this is liberal Hollywood so we all know how its going to end up sadly. (please prove me wrong Netflix).
GARBAGE
Oh, my nerdgasm it’s too strong!!
Not impressed by Adam, he looks pretty effeminate. 🧐. I hope they have all the same goodness in this. The corny Skeletor and the original music. If there’s no original music, I’m out! That ruined Voltron.
yes
The Sword of Power breaking is a metaphor for all the fragile male egos shattering at the idea that Teela might be more than a mere damsel in distress here. This show literally had a whole spinoff series where women were the main protagonists in the 1980's but its apparently woefully inconsistent to present the show's original strong female character in a similar sense here? Oh lordy, she got a practical haircut and gained muscle! This must mean He-Man will be relegated to the status of Orko! The logic is baffling.
So where's shera lol
Cersei?
I wonder if this is going to be a bait and switch type of show
How much you wanna bet He-Man will be gay?
i really hope this continues and eventually spins off she-ra.  this is the he-man and she-ra treatment i want.
Cersei?
Let me guess...gender fluid?
Its looks cool but it's Netflix so I'm already expecting He-man to be gay with Skeletor.
NYEEEE!!!!
She-Ra be like: Hold my unicorn 🦄
seems like they don't wanna tell us he is HEMAN !!
I knew Netflix would Netflix this show up. Shame.
GET THIS SHIT OUT OF HERE
Teela and the LGBTQ masters of the universe..... ow yeah and He Man is there to ..... sometimes
Michael Jackson was "He-He-Man 😆🤣😂😹😆🤣
Ahh so teela looks like she has been mainlining testosterone and adam looks like a little beta bitch. Go woke go broke.
This new lesbian- lead cartoon show looks pretty interesting. That huge guy with the sword looks bad ass. Hopefully they make a show about him. I feel like fans would like that.
We all came for this @1:55 ... needs more echo and reverb.
You know, I feel somewhat torn, I am happy to see a new revelation,  but I was really hoping for a live action rendition. I feel like netflix missed on this one!
So the sword is divided into two... I expect there'll be a She-Man? Hahaha 😂
As a kid I never watched he man because I thought it was a funny joke series But this trailer makes me wanna see it a bit tbh
Woke,  liberal activist wrote this show.  Get woke go broke.  This show will fail on a epic scale.  The backlash will be worse than the last Jedi. I love Kevin Smith but his credibility will be over. I'm canceling Netflix and they'll be massive cancelation after this show comes out.
So is this He-Man or She-Man? I'm confused.
Woke garbage
No. I don't need this.
This looks awesome. The 2002 remake is really good too. It has some very interesting moments. Like seeing King Randor when he was a captain in Eternia's army battling Keldor, who will become Skeletor. I liked seeing Prince Adam becoming He-Man for the first time. If you're a fan of Masters of The Universe and you haven't seen the 2002 version, you should.
Teela: "Look at me! I'm the man, now." Adam: "But I still remember the song-ayayay." >_> Audience: [groans] Skeletor: "Haha! Now that's a killing joke." Audience: -_- "...We'll allow it, because you're Mark Hamill." :-/
I'd love a He-man series about he-man, really.  She-ra had her series, i'm really not sure why He-man needs to be turned into She-ra too.
He-Teela! 'I stole theeeee powerrrrrrr'. He-Teela and the sidekicks of the universe?
que mal el diseño de teela(1:46) un (machirulo).....bueno lo que sea. aguante He-Man.
Okay, I get updating the armor.... but did they have to make it so incredibly generic? I mean, come on, like half of this on how badass or interesting the characters look.
"Christmas? What's that?!" -Skeletor
Back in the day, This shit just hit different on my 13 inch Magnavox from sears!
Teela looks and sounds like crap.  Going to wait for reviews on this one.. if the story isn't 10/10 it's a hard pass from me bro.  I've had enough of this woke-ness with she-ra.  At least she-ra and katra looked attractive (until katra cut her hair).    Go woke go broke.. I'll instead watch baki, 7 deadly sins, kengan ashura, or lots of other anime that still has testosterone.
Is this masters of Teelaverse?
Don't be fooled by sjw brainwash
And I say...
I guess we get to see another version of Shazam
It looks like this serie is going to be more about Teela than He-Man.
No impressed but I will give it a chance.
If He-Man isnt the lead here ! Then whats the point !!
Intresting. Lets see how much of Heman/Adam is actually in the story vs Teela being the main/centarl charecter. I'm going to watch it just to see the explanation of a race swapped Grayskull as Adams ancestor and whether they call him a bi-racial charecter now. After all the shows producers clearly stated that having two buff blonde White guys was too much and diversity was demanded. I really hope this shows good. I'm rooting for it  to noit destroy all of the 80's goodness.
now i'm 39y and i will see it again
So, Teela is back from college ?
If Netfux has this I remain cautiously optimistic..
Don’t trust Netflix and don’t trust Kevin Smith to get this right.
sheman
We are all safe from He-man dying because this show will get canceled before they slay him. Thank God
is this gonna be some feminism show where teelas the lead
at least they didnt make Adam a non binary empowered female black character. It's becoming a rarity
this is not a continuation, this a soft reboot that focus on the end of masters of the universe. They are pissing me off, they marketed this toward the original fans of the series who are In their later 30's to 50 year olds..... But changed everything from the iron cross, orko, cringer is smart now and a leader, teela is the strong warrior even though almost every episode that center around her, she needed saving (not all)... Skeletor can turn into a he-man ..... Beast man is a hero now, good Lyn is hero now....  And let's be real, the transformation scene is cool in all, but the original is better. Why couldn't they just copy that one ? He-man must grab his sword with two hands and scream, "I have the powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr".....  Kevin Smith even said he doesn't like Motu, but now he was always a fan.... Bs....  I am going to watch as much as I can, but I. Already disappointed. Good news is, I felt the same way about the 200x series, but that series grew up me and turn out really good. It was He-mans sword in 200x series that threw me off...... I prefer the original sword from the cartoon.
burn this woke shit. just when i though we getting a good show we got this failure. smfh
She-Man?   lol go buy likes elsewhere, read the comments, no one wants this SJW sht
I don't know Rick, it looks like shitty woke politics
Why is Teela drawn so eyesoringly manly? Not to mention the crappy hairstyle...
O god I’m starting to get scared this looks like some women empowerment woke type show that ruins everything. I hope not I love he-man
You just had to go woke on this didn't you?... well I hope you enjoy going broke because it's gonna happen.
Kevin got me with this one. That lying sack of ish did  good hiding his sjw garbage in this.
Holy shiiiittttttt
No quirkiness or humor... I'm worried
I was born in 1983 and I still have my castle grayskull and battlecat.  This trailer looks great.   He-man was always best as an ensemble show.   At least in my opinion.  So it doesnt bother me at all that the trailer isn't "the heman show".    It's masters of the universe.
She-Man and the Masturbators of the Puniverse... pass
Please feed Adam.
Looks great!
hard cringe. This looks horrible.
the female characters destroy this
So... Teela's adventures, with guest apeareances of He-man... I'm a little dissapointed... If called this TV show something teelas related, no Issue, I would watch it and probably love it... But don't call He-Man a show about her...
1:11 faker??
Kevin Smith is a liar.
castlevaniaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Spoilers, they're going to C@Ck Adam and make Teela the hero. There, I saved you all from having to suffer Communist Propaganda.
Could He-man be still such a thing??
Looks promising, hopefully it can be interesting yet not overstuffed
Teela with woke haircut???
Ну понятно, на первом плане будет сильная и независимая, мужеподобная и без сисек. Тупо нетфликс. А вы Химена ждали?..
Here is what I think is going to happen. The Power Sword has been split, so Adam can't turn into He-Man.  Teela trains in the badlands and gets buff like Goku while everyone gets old from dependency on magic.  Buff Teela helps Adam reunite the Power Sword so he can turn into He-man.  In doing so, she has to defeat evil He-man (like Luke does in Star Wars) I can see how it looks like mostly Teela in the trailer, but that's a good thing.  Let's focus on some other characters in the universe to expand the story. I do not like Teela's butch half-shaved head. If she turns out to be trans or gay, then I'll stop watching.... It looks like Evil-Lyn is also very buff, so that might just be how the females are in this cartoon.
😡🤬😡 !!!"WOKE HE-MAN SUCKS"!!! 😡🤬😡
Just make sure you don't femanize the show, you all have She-Ra,  Adam/He-mans sister for that and it's a good thing, She-Ra rocks too!  Keep the characters and the lore intact but make the stories deeper with more substance.  The original was aimed at 8 year olds these days we could get away with something geared a bit older. BTW Netflix & Producers: You have Teela all wrong, She was a Woman not a demeaning, bitter hater, fix it.
Crap.
Oh come on guys, stop being a bunch of pessimists.
Looks like they are going to ruin this show trying to make a stupid feminist shit
Also this whole making the strongest man in the universe turning into a twig stuff is already not a good look, He-man is the protector of grey skull and so strong he can kick superman so hard it'll leave a foot dent so the fact he's getting downgraded for a woman that literally trains Adam in armed and unarmed combat is completely ridiculous like bruh I understand that the show barely focuses on her character and all but she does play a very important role in the series she's the daughter of the sorceress of grey skull which means there's a possibility of her getting the powers of grey skull too it's just she has mommy issues let's just say that.
memories of the alhambra 2.Season please
I can almost taste the wokeness.
I'm just like uh everyone was the main character in the original series so chill it out also Tella was already a strong female lead she took on skeletor knowing for a fact she could've died but still fought him, you just need to pay closer attention.
Don't watch it we need to stand together and reject this woke garbage.
Why did they change his chest plate from a cross to an h ???
Will be quite the awakening for some people when they will see what this show will be really about.
Looks incredible, can't wait to watch this with my kid.  Seeing these characters move around outside the 4-5 canned animation cells from the 80s is going to be mind blowing!
This is for adults.  Because we are naustalgic,
Trailer was sucked. Nothing new 🤪
Looks OK, but why did you have to emasculate Adam? My action figure Adam was just as buff as he-man and why not... he's the effing Prince of eternia. Why give him the cringer treatment?
We all know he man will take a backseat to a strong women.  Woke garbage
She-Ra Already finished, It's time for the adults
💥💥💥💥💥💥 Holy shit
Teela will become the protagonist once He-Man's sidelined.
This looks cheap to me, compared to Marvels “what if “ trailer.
more like "she-man" not even gonna bother
NOT GAY ENOUGH
Why are they changing the story to suit a woman ffs?!!!! I grew up with this cartoon, it's called He-Man because HE'S the star of this story! Feminists ruin EVERYTHING, I hope this fails like every other woke trash that craps on old fans. Do these companies need to go broke before they learn that the majority of the world are right leaning and hate this woke feminist wahmen rhetoric, even women are over it!  For those woke purple haired extreme feminists blinded by a lack of intellect... You will NEVER be as strong as men, it's biologically impossible, go back to school and re-learn science! Stop trying to cancel men in everything from TV, movies and games, the world has shown they hate your views, you will go broke chasing this lie!
I hope they make the Sorceress strong this time. She was almost useless in the previous versions
Hilarious that Stink-O is in the show.
Skeletor better come with his slick and savage one-liners. If not, this will be a disappointment.
Imagine the boomers ,who hated the she ra reboot for giving adora a flat chest, will react to this
show de bola !!! amaie !!!!!
Wat?!
By the POWER of my 80's childhood HE-MAN IS  B A C K
Netflix ruins everything
Wonder how many episodes in that a character comes out as gay?
Adam looks like princess Diana
Amazing
It'll be the lesbian Teela show, with He-Man being the side character.
Bet they cram in some black and ethnic minority characters to be woke
5 frames per second looks like.  Very cheap
Well thanks Kevin smith for destroying he-man great job 👏🏻😒
1st teaser was super WOW ! 1st trailer is super WOKE !
I'm almost 40.  Saturday mornings watching He-Man, Thundercats and Transformers. Best time of my life. Then the rest of the weekend going outside and play all day.
Lesbian He -Man ?
I am going to give this a try but its not a continuation of the 80s version.  This seems to be more like the recent comics and the 200x versions. If they go off course and turn Teela gay or make her the new He-Man they will get a lot of blow back from the fans.  I will wait and see first. I have no problem with representation but when done right and not forced.  Teela and Adam were always a love interest for each other and changing that would be forced, and a slap to the face for the fans! If the 80s version had continued they would have got married! Anyways I will give this show a try instead of taking the word from negative youtubers who complain about everything, even when a movie is in production, they still find a way to complain about it... Do I agree with them race swapping established characters? No but I seen no one complaining when Nick Fury was race swopped or when they race swopped Zodiac in the 200x remake!  That is why I do not take these negative youtubers serious.  When there is a reason to be upset like making superman black or black panther gay for lazy diversity points, well Hollywood will not take our complaints serious because a lot of these negative youtubers cry wolf too much!
Teela's not as scantily clad as she used to be; in fact there's not enough skin on any of the women. Lame. At least He Man's still allowed to be shirtless.
So many memories loved it
Teela and Prince Adam are the same age "geniuses", if Teela grew and became more robust (almost like a man with masculine features) Adam also had to have grown, not necessarily to the proportions of He man but to those of a stocky young man, and not that effeminate image with clear feminine features.  You and your stupid ideology that destroys all the good that was made, but underestimates He Man fans, the franchise has been kept alive for 40 years by fans and assured them that it will survive "Wokeflix".
Where is He Man's Tiger ???
A white guy in a lead role??? how dare you netflix
ainz ooal gown is team skeletor!
This is not He Man. Bye
We never forget He Man
I want Thundercats!
Please don't be woke!Please don't be woke!Please don't be woke!Please don't be woke!Please don't be woke!
So he mai is black and some lesbians show up?
Looks like this is going to be woke trash…
Please don’t suck... please don’t suck... please don’t suck... please don’t suck...
This would be amazing in real life acting
I... have... the... Power!!!!!!!! 💪
Tinham que fazer modificações ridiculas, semore a Netflix fazendo merda com o que era bom....
Woman ...
brabo
Netflix. I'm getting down on my hands and knees. And i'm begging you. Please make at least 10 seasons of this. PLEEEEEAAASE!
now I'm a bit hyped ( ͡^ ͜ʖ ͡^)
எலேய் செத்தப்பயலுவலா தமிழ் டப் பன்னுங்கல செத்த பயலுவலா
Lol luckily had the original. Free of all the mental illnesses getting forced on the kids now days.   Netflix cancellation still the best cancel of last year.
Yaaaas! Can't wait!
Making money on remakes NetFlix be like "I HAVE THE POWWWWWWERRRRRRRRR"
Something seems off but I hope it's good.
Where is the humongous IRON CROSS ?
Tamil dubbed please 🙏🙏🙏❤️
Tamil dubbes please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Heman back iam biggest fan for heman
Inb4 He-Man gets cucked and outdone by a woman.
I can't wait for YellowFlash and that other youtuber to be proven wrong, I bet they wont even man up and make an apology video to Kevin Smith. They will find some little thing in the show to grip onto as a gotcha moment and die on that hill... Not that it matters their audience are a bunch of brain dead tools anyways.
Divided sword????? Kinda went Blackstar on that one did ya...
So basically is Teela show and the other characters
I am just worried this is going to turn out be another SWJ crap that we have gotten soooo much of from netflix of late.. And to be honest the trailer do NOT have my at ease.. Go back and watch He-man or  Adam have less screen time in the trailer then She-Re or Teela so yeah not at ease but hey who knows it might surprise.
I have the power, I am He-man
Why did they take away He Mans Maltese cross on his chest and replace it with a silly "H"?  Did they think it looked too much like an iron cross or what
I miss that  actual  theme by the power of Grayskull
Looks like I’m getting Netflix
Im not to in the know here. Is this a reboot or a continuation from the original. Cause it said 40 years but i do remember another reboot series that looks similar to this that was on between 40 years ago and now
So they are going to transform Teela in a (He Man - B)... left wing crap
Quality looks great, but a movie would have been better.
We want tamil dub ❤
He man😍
Teela used to be pretty, now looks more like a man. Kinda getting worried about this. Why do they have to attack women by changing them into men to be tough?
The original stays the best but let's c what Netflix has to offer
Looks cheesey, but I'll check it out for nostalgia.
Where’s the old music ?
Hindi dubbed plzzzz
Please be good....80s cartoons are so great, remake all the good ones and I will be in heaven.
Please be good....80s cartoons are so great, remake all the good ones and I will be in heaven.
ale gówno...
Soy un trolazo, me gusta el pedazo!!
This is giving me Castlevania vibes!
He man😋
Just another woke recreation ruining the original.
Remember Swamp Thing show that had very little Swamp Thing in it ....That.
yeah its called He-Man and the Masters of the Universe... I saw it when I was like 5.. now I'm 37 and my kids watch SpongeBob!! idk wtf!!
So magic is gone, Adam cant transform and Teela with her new SJW hair cut is in every scene.  Yeah safe to say I know where this show is going.
Thunder cats 2.0!
Still no match to the original.
He Man
ഞാൻ ആണ് യഥാർത്ഥ ശക്തി🥰❤️🥰
Reskal koottain sathiye
you can just smell the wokeness miles away...
Fantastic animation…I HAVE A BAAAAAAADDDD feeling they’ll ruin it, though.
That’s mark hammil as greyskull
90's kid
Mas um desenho antigo arruinado pela NETIFLIX...
Hail Skeletor <3
The fact the team is actually bothering to dive deeper into the MOTU lore, with an actual plot and storyline of the power sword split into two, should be causing ALL supposedly loyal MOTU fans to rejoice.  Instead all these whiney, hate-filled, toxic cesspool drivel from entitled adults crying about Netflix and Kevin Smith  destroying their childhood… GOD. Get a freaking life.   Finally a decent plot to elevate this universe, and finally giving Adam some DEPTH as a character… all these are flying over your turd heads because you just CANNOT accept a major female character taking centre stage for five episodes. The strongest episodes of the old Filmation series included Tesla’s Quest and Tesla’s Triumph, and even in the 200x series, the Teela and Sorceress driven episodes stood out as well. Now, Kevin Smith and Netflix are simply gelling the more interesting elements of the series together as an introduction into the MOTU, first as an homage to the old series, and to bring new viewers into the fandom, and what do YOU want? He Man’s nipples taking centre stage for 90% of the time with no actual plot, just so that he is the HERO? Even when so many other characters are given opportunities to contribute to the plot, you complain and complain and complain?   What if Teela wasn’t taking over the main role for Part 1? What if it was Man At Arms? Would you still complain?   My GOD. And FYI, Kevin Smith and Netflix don’t owe us MOTU fans anything. It’s so disappointing that the fandom is such a hypocritical, toxic group of middle-aged crybabies WHO HAVE NOT EVEN WATCHED THE SERIES YET.
RETURN OF THE KING
I hope they make a new version of M.A.S.K.....(seems fitting in these current times)  Switchblade,boulder hill,thunderhawk....HELL YEAH
This gives me the chills!! Can't wait to watch He-man once again :)
Wow never have I've been excited HE-MAN!!!!!!
LOL The chicks look like dudes.. The west has some shitty character designs.. Yeah no thanks.
Stop ruining my childhood pedoflix
no She-Ra? :(
Oh dear!! They’ve only gone and broken it..
Lol, all the offended chuds squirming and reeeing about women in the comments. Amazing.
I hope this is better than Cop Out
Im just mad we dont have the funny skeletor voice
Can’t wait for the incels to be outraged about something stupid.
Looks like its strong independent woman and hehe man on 3rd plan now.
Still can't get over the fact He-Man wears a H (for Hordak) on his chest rather than the Iron cross from the 80s. Its 100% Hordak bc the new Skeletor also wears it.
А где Орко?
Hard pass. Too many red flags.
I'm 47. Sitting in my office on a coffee break. Literally fizzing about this.
He Man without his powers looks so weak. They have changed the essence of his powers already. Another nostalgia cash grab :(
As a kid who grew up in the 80s with the original He-Man,I'd have to say this is garbage lol
Where is the bgm ?  😘😘😘😘😘
Teela looks more like a man with lipstick applied.. a beautiful atheletic skilful teela i remember from from 2000s teela.
GOOSEBUMPS BABY GOOSEBUMPS!!!
Ivan el trolazo
I thought the show was about He-man? KekeL?
Maybe this is good also of they make it a movie, maybe its fit also for chris hemsworth
oh cool, hey used the split sword idea from the original series, nice
this series should put a real BAD ASS she-ha
I'm going to be perfectly honest, I'm just watching this for skeletor.
Netflix has done it again with Masters of the Universe: Revelation. Finally, with an all-star cast leading the way, with the voices of Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liam Cunningham & Lena Headey. You can’t ask for more. You go Netflix. Just waiting for Jayce and the wheel warriors now...
👀 HE-MAN was one of the Best "Saturday/ Sunday Morning Cartoons"......
Next up from Netflix, G. I. Joanne, the Scarlett O'Hara vs Baroness Saga.
I will give it a chance, but my woke crap alarm is already ringing.
Thunder cats  i hope in future  maybe why not :)
No way....the older version was the best.....this is some anime crap!!!
Look, I'll accept this stuff when Women are also drafted into the Military. Until then, there is only He-Man.
yeah, i'm getting a real strong vibe that He-Man is not the main character at all. He has to take a back seat because he's a straight white male
Meh it was very average when I saw it in the 80's and frankly not much has changed.
Looks shit.
Mannn this looks amazing
If it smells, looks like woke poop, it's because it's all woke poop..... Kevin Smith saying this is the continuation to the classic is a lie.. What next Thundercats with Cheetara leading instead of lion-o.
ഗ്രെസ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി............ Uff pever mowna 🤣
I hope it is not to make feminist be like we can do everything
młody dron to kox jdjdjdjdjdjd ?
they just had bring feminism into it.......... how long will we take this punishment before we say enough to the elites!
How could you change the voice of skeletor
So they split up the sword so Teela could be She-Woman? 🤦‍♂️  Also bring back the original theme song, not this generic music crap!
I cannot add enough likes to this new series.
Why he look like Logan Paul tho! FYI He-man has black eye brows and brown tan skin.
Iván the Trolazo, comming to Netflix
Every episode should end with a little PSA/moral lesson like in the 80s cartoon.     *epic violent episode concludes* "Kids, remember to brush your teeth!"
I swear to god if this show only has He-Man in it for the first episode, then nothing but Adam as a sidekick for the rest of the season it will be a major fail.
My birthday gift
This looks really good but I just wish the sword of power had a better design instead of the generic one they went with.
So Kevin Smith lied when he said it wasn't going to basically be the teela show?
I’m… a bit scared… why was there so little focus on He-Man, Skeletor and everyone..?! This… this isn’t gonna be one of those kinds of “while everyone is doing this, let’s follow this other character!” shows, is it..?! IS IT?! NETFLIX?! YOU HAD CRINGER AND SKELETOR TALK, DO NOT TEASE ME LIKE THIS!!!
Prince Adam is a weeb without the sword
JUST A LITTLE heehee
Battlecat sounds lame. Seems like this really is a primarily Teela story, if so, kind of disappointing it seemed initially marketed as He-man. Kind of a bait and switch. I would still watch a Masters of the Universe offshoot focusing on different characters. Just be straight up about it.
You can't fool me into watching a classic going woke!! I will watch something else.
So Teela is now the main character, He-Man is now a supporting one and Skeletor has half the Sword.  Looks interesting. Hope they land it well because this concept can flop big time.
So Teela replaced He-Man... can't wait to miss this. At least I know this is bad before I like it - friendly warning: despite great action and interesting story Castelvania was ruined by modern clichés and this show is right in the same bag too.
What a disappointment!
Woke toxicity
Everyone got an upgrade,  except Tee-la.. she kind of looks weird... She looks like Someone took inspiration from Kirsten Stewart awkward looks???... ewww..
Butch teela to the rescue!
Black lesbian token character
we want that old title song to be back..... it is essence of it hehe.
Such an ugly lady teela as become…had crush on her in 2000s he man ..now she is filled with androgen..at least they could have made her look pretty
"Still remember the tune?" *clears throat*  "AND I SAY HEYYYYYYYYYY YAYYYYY AHHHH AH AH.......HEYYYYYYYYYYY YAYYYYYY YAY.....I SAID HEY!!!!!!  A WHAT'S GOING ON!"
'Do you remember the toon?' Me: 'AND SO I CRY SOMETIMES WHEN I'M LYIN IN BED'
Até hoje não entendo o esqueleto bombadao, 😁😀🤣
He man is still a white, blond, blue eyes man?  I'm shocked.
Wait.. Teela is the protaganist in he-man?
El eskeletor y heman gay
Only 80s kids would know the importance of this…..
Hmmm well good i never expected much of Netflix to begin with.
cringers new voice somehow found a way to be more cringe than the original.     somehow I feel the same feeling from this shitty reboot that I get every time Nintendo makes a new paper mario game. like my soul is losing its power to be excited about things. I dont think everything from the past was good I just really dislike this specific thing. the original was fast passed and action packed but terrible and funny because of the low quality. this is like if someone tried to make a serious anime version of the room by Tommy Waisou
It's remind the day when i was child. THX
was a big fan back in the early 80s. Loved reading the mini comics behind each action figure. Goddard's '87 movie didn't come close. I hope a new film will give it justice.
This series is going to be awesome.
Tamil dubbed please ❤️
😐 THEY RUINED IT! 😐
He Man as side character.. dont make him pathetic ..it feels more of teela and masters of universe
He become half naked when he have the power.
We most likely just saw every scene He-Man will be in for the entire series.
Is it just me or does Skeletor sound like the Joker or  Arnim Zola or maybe the Trickster? I think I hear a little Megatronus in there as well.
I was expecting to hear that legendary trailer music. At least for a few seconds :(
Lol they are deleting all the negative comments how they bait and switched for "teela and the masters of the universe"  So sick of this woke bull shit
Wow… remember playing with the toys when I was in elementary school
Since this is Netflix, I can´t wait to see which people of Eternia are gay and trans. Oh and will Evil-Lynn finally stand up against white heterosexual Skeletor?
I'm only happy, if there's a lesson for life at the end
Soy Trolazo
Как мультик?Почему мультик?За что мультик? Обещали же фииииииииииильм...
Eh, I prefer the classics. This one seems too action focused and too serious. While the original version has more comedic value and more laid back.
LMAO. Nice try but nope. You can keep this woke stuff. Imagine having He-Man as a sidekick in his own show. There is something seriously wrong with the people in Hollywood. I hope one day they come to grips with their daddy issues.
Wo ist das Kreuz auf der Brust hin? Der islamismus wird unser ende sein.......
Mamma mia
He man😎
Wow can’t wait to watch this on Netflix
I think my muscles just grew watching this trailer.  After She Ra nailed it so hard, I got high hopes for this.
Moneysupermarket ruined this for me
Looking forward to it!!!
Any tamil he man fans from chutti tv?
Uh oh I smell female empowerment!!!
Way more anime than the original... They should have stuck with the original He-Man voice and battle cat...
Adam he man?
ah shit why does the animation looks like netflix  castlevania
Just one question, why prince Adam suddenly looks like a girl in this series?
I can't wait to see my childhood show. 😍
This sirious bizness version of the master of univers should be intrestig as the shera reamake.
I'm 90's but THIS is BADASS!
Cringer's voice is just odd to me, but otherwise... WHAT DID I JUST WITNESS!?!!?!? I JUST.... WOW! JUST WOW! I CAN'T... I'M NOT READY!
WHY IS HIS head SO SMALL? WHY IS HIS HEAD so small??
Heman is back😍
good content
Oh this looks fuckin awesome dude
Netflix He-Man =They-Wamen Teela IS Man-At-Arms ffs??😂 Race-swapping confirmed! Makers ADMIT TOO MANY WHITE GUYS! 🤡 MORE AGENDA DRIVEN PROPAGANDA! Can't wait to NOT watch this racist, sexist, man-hating turd show 💩 WOKE NETFLIX MORONS 🤣
the music is too good. Inspiring.
ഗ്രേസിക്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി 😁😁
Kochu Tv He Man Fans association KERALA ❤️
Please be more brutal
Да сука. ДА! Это должно быть охуенно!
Wow Netflix garbage reimagining. Glad I'm not paying for my subscription anymore
I’ve waited 30+ years for this, I hope Netflix has taken this seriously!
Hewomyn
Will king hiss feature in this series ?
He-man, my wonderful childhoods Memories. I have the power
0:54 Great, He-Man's got a dual-sword style like Skeletor.
Wow this show is going to suck.  Bait and switch.  They should call it the Tila show.  Kevin Smith once a great director and story teller is now a hack and hollyweird shill.  R.I.P Kevin Smith.
peak fantasy
The old he-man background score was lit.. 🔥
Where is the traditional HE MAN theme music...? Im missing it
Who wrote this atrocious dialogue?
Old memories refreshed.. welcome back
Eu tenho a força👊
Totally got the wrong voice actor in italian.
Looking kinda woke with another ass kicking know it all girl. So no thanks.
tell me please do i need to what the previous tv show to watch this one? (sorry for bad english)
Nut
Voice acting sounds garbage no surprise there
I have recollected my memories of old times of my childhood I'm more than excited for He-man And want to hear the magic sentence "I have the  Power". Its cool too see the recreation of magical world.
Woke trash. Netflix and Kevin Smith should be ashamed of themselves.
if at the end of the episode there is no more moral sermon then there will be a riot
Is this supposed to be a serious movie??
This looks really really good. Awsome looking cartoon I’ll be watching this one
Where is his iron cross?
you can tell they hired Japanese animators
Very Beautiful 😍🧡
So they did not utter word 'Heman' due to some shitty snowflakes?
You can see hiw in the name of the movie is missing "He man"
I didn't see Cringer transform = boring 🤷🏻‍♂️
Wow..it's he-man 🥳
"...and as goes Eternia, so goes the entire universe" ok Cercei Lannister 😳
WHY do they STILL have to portray Adam as a lil BITCH that cant do shit unless he turn to He-Man.  Some where along the way he should've been trained. THATS MAN-AT-ARMS FUCKIN JOB.....his bio LITERALLY says he is  Adams mentor
Goosebumps!!!! Can't wait for it to air! *The Glee!!!*
The glass is still half empty for me. We'll see...
this looks fuckin awesome... hopefully we can get a proper ThunderCats to go with this next year!
After more than 30 years. I grew up seeing this cartoon and movie then with Dolph Lungren. Aka Drago!
I'm ready for this frfr....been telling my kids about he-man forever😁😁
The last 30 seconds, it just reminded the childhood memory. "I have the power' 😎
Is it he-man ?? My childhood hero....
why netflix is all about magic magic ......
I have the power
"Nyeh" "ha" "just like a..."  If I don't hear these lines I swear...
YES!!!!! Awww! My Hero
Phuk netbitz
IF they make it SJW bull it will never work - inject broken teachings only kills the joy the story gives
Welp. This show is gonna see a lot of controversy
Not one running butt scene ( i know how that sounds), sideways roll or camera punch. Guess they are saving the best bits for netflix
plz tell me that silver hawks is coming too ..
Here is the way I see it. Those of us that grew up in the 80’s want an extension of the original series. That goes for any show the re-boot. As for the changes, it is disappointing that it has to be “woke”.  I’m all for change but for Pete’s sake come up with an original idea and stop pissing on the classics.  Those that are looking forward to the this train wreck headed our way doesn’t truly understand the nostalgia that goes with being an 80’s kid.
Its amazing how a cartoon has been caught in the culture wars I hate how people can't just enjoy shit and shut up about is something woke or not.
Here we go with the feminist movement
so a bunch of adults are going to be watching cartoons for a few weeks now
Masters of the WOKE Universe: HE-TEELA
By the Power of Gray Skull... I Have the Power
I'm only here for Skeletor... Please give us our smug, sarcastic papa bones back!
Hey Netflix, PAY THE ANIMATORS YOU HIRE A LIVING WAGE.
Love he man
Nooooooooo…. What the heck is happening with the Lesbian????
Can he-man beat son of Krypton?
That Adam/He-Man transformation has low energy and too much colors
Now I just want a Silverhawks reboot
Wish the would stop using anime format it's terrible
Meh, I would have rather seen a decent Thundercat reboot. Not like that 2011 travesty.
Pandering and disappointment incoming. I bet heman isnt around for a full season
He has da POWAAAAAAA!!!!
I was to young to realize Skeletor was by far the cooler character between he and he man
Oh...okay then
The first Trailer looked so good, why did you have to go and ruin it Netflix? Can someone just let Karen.. err.. I mean Teela speak to the manager so we can remove her and get on with the better looking bits of the show?
How come the he-man costume from the toyline and not the show
Will He-man become a villain or will he be controlled and Teela will have to face him alone? And beat him? Too forced!
Yes, this is what Netflix needed to boom up there cartoons franchise
Why does Adam have an effeminate face? And Teela has a masculine face?
Se entregar o que promete, isso sim que é um revival. Na tua cara, Thundercats Roar.
Hmmm this does not look good.
Get ready everyone teela is the new heman and she don’t need no man lmao I can’t this is going to be so cringe sadly I was one of the people hopeing this would be good but Netflix and Hollywood in general don’t care about the fans anymore not sure if they ever did
ഗ്രെസ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി...എന്നിൽ കൂടിയിരിക്കുന്ന ശക്തി പുറത്തുവാ..ഹി-മാൻ 🔥
This - better - not - suck Even if it IS more about Teela than Prince Adam himself, I'm okay with that so long as they have equal time and importance. More so for He-man, for obvious reasons. Please, Kevin James. Please do this justice. The trailers are rockin' and giving me....hope. So don't get WOKE. :)  Also, PLEASE, for the love of He-Man's pecs, do a little "What's going on song/reference" cameo for all us die hards. Thank you! Much love to you :)
This doesn't look like it will be about He-Man
ojala que tambien netflix puedavolver a transmitir thundercats 2011
This is utter shyt
After 30 I listen this voice I have power of gry skull 😀😀
They changed the sword damn
WHAT MAKES A MAN, IS IT THE POWER IN HIS HANDS?  IS IT HIS QUEST FOR GLORY?  GIVE IT ALL YA GOT…TO FIGHT TO THE TOP…SO WE CAN KNOW YOUR STORY
Thanks a lot
Is She-Ra going to be in this, or will she be getting her own show?  I'm not saying that that they have to include her somehow---I'm just saying that it would be a missed opportunity.
This looks like Thundercats!!
these colours look amazing
Ok, so I'm in but if Teela ends up getting "the power of Grayskull" like Colleen Wing in Iron Fist... :/
Looks good, thank you for the video.
Producer :  We need a voice actor for villain ! Mark Hamill : sound like somebody are calling me
So, Kevin Smith was lying through his teeth when he said that, “the show isn’t about Teela”… 🙄 *yawn* this kind of stuff is becoming way too cliché.
looks like an animated movies of 80x ,with graphics of today .
teela dyked out... he man gonna have to show her the power to get back on track!
Toppppppp
Teela’s hair looks, Eyugh.
Called He Man yet they are gonna be sidelining him for Teela. This series is gonna fail hard.
Is Shera a lesbian in this version?
It is simply beautiful, I already want to see it ❤️
I literally just shot my pants
I think it’s the same animation studio that did castlevania. Looking forward!
I never watched he man growing up. Heard of it though, I saw the thumbnail and the title and I instantly thought he man. Jeez his character design is so out there u just don’t forget him even though never watching it and the title doesn’t make u forget.
Meh.
He-Man's chest plate insignia looks like what I remember as the Horde, Hordak's minions.  I wonder if that's the revelation?  That somehow Hordak is involved in all this.  Looks interesting tho.  Will check it out for sure.
He Man Trailer >>>>>>> All Seasons of She Ra 😍😍
I can’t believe Skeletor and the masters of the universe is getting a remake!
He-Man was just awesome during 80-90s..
He Man Trailer >>>>>>> All Seasons of She Ra 😍😍
He Man Trailer >>>>>>> All Seasons of She Ra 😍😍
where is Orko?
Lame.
it's really cool how they continue the legacy of heman 💪
Mi infancia CTM!!!!!  wuju!
Hope this is better than Knights f the Zodiac...cuz Netflix version was awful.
I feel like the trailer show the whole seasons split up in an odd timeline way :p
Now do Thundercats
This is going on my must watch list. ^u^
I heard this is going to be woke as hell.  Think I’ll pass.
I’m a nazi ask me anything
Her: still know the tune? Me: defenetely!  HEYEEEEAHEEEEEYEEEEEEAAAAAH!
EU TENHO A FORÇAAAAAAAA
Wasn't expectating that... but damn, it looks promising
If he wears a dress……..I am DONE.
Gay Adam? Gay Teela? Do these woketards seriously think they can turn it's audience gay if being gay is NOT a choice?
I am so excited for this.
Don't mind me, just drinking the tears of the "i DoNT wAnT CHANGE1111!!!" squad in the comments.
"He man"  is that you?
Amazing! thank you Netflix
1:50 to 1:54 Insert Heyyyyyy ya 10 hr loop
Arms to fury.
Has the cat always talked?
I wanted this to mainly be about he man but ya know it’s the Teela show now bc it has to be fair and what did they do to her hair like wth
Show of the year?
Is He-Man possessed when he has red eyes fighting Talya?
Holy shit he man is getting sidelined in his own series 😂😂
So Kevin Smith lied then?.. hmmm noted 🤔
I wonder if the new he man is gonna keep that strong homoerotic vibe?
It's gonna be hard to be better than princess of power tho
Faz sentido sarou a she-ra nada mais justo que lançar    ri -men

this teela looks like crap allready hates her she looks like a man urgh
Don't f*** this up Netflix...
He-man
can never get enough skeletor
En la actualidad hay mejores técnicas de animación y deciden crear esto :/ personajes sin alma. Al menos es lo que se ve en trailer, esperemos a verla para dar una critica justa :(
What did you expect in the nowadays USA entertainment industry? Did you expect a He-Man centered series? It was just bait for all of the real fans to join Netflix. We are living an age of darkness where creativity is no longer important but the woke agendas are (just look at Teela's new haircut and body, and He-Man isn't hot and muscled anymore, he looks weak). I'm sick of it, they're going to loose a lot of money but the aim of doing this is, what they really want once more, is to divide us fans and create an unnecessary social conflict. It already happened to many beloved franchises like Terminator, Charmed, DC, Star Trek, Star Wars and Doctor Who among a very large list that will grow more and more as we speak. Escapism and occidental cinema are now truly lost,  we just have to accept this reality and switch for better entertainment industries. At least we've still got the shows and movies from previous and glorious ages to enjoy instead of the nowadays trush. I wouldn't be surprised if they delete or censor them in time for us not to be able to watch them anymore.
I have the power. Wow, goosebumps.
My only experience with He Man is robot chicken so I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop this whole time. I mean Netflix already made "1776" so...
Sooo... they're going to make the main character a butched up Teela?  Meh...
1:49 Why yes I do!   ...and I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay  Hey, yay, yay  I said hey, what's goin' on?
This looks just like a new excuse to make more faminazi propaganda. Look at Teela's eyebrows! She's looking awful.
To bad it’s on Netflix and I cannot and will not support it ever.
Kevin Smith lied people don't fall for it.
First Transformers and now He-Man.  Welcome back childhood.  It's been a long time.
If this they somehow make this about women power or trans I will get rid of my tv and all digital entertainment and just live to work like a souless Chinese factory worker
This new he man cartoon looks awsome
Prepare for maximum gayness. Teelas gay. Adam’s gay. He man and Skeltor spoon.
Awesome but I still dont like he color grading. Although its probably close to og
Maybe its just me, but it seems like they made Teela the main character and He-Man has been sidelined. Also they changed Teela’s design to make her look more like a man and on top of that it seems all the cool stuff we saw in the trailer from earlier is going to happen in the first episode. Please tell me I’m wrong.
Es un chiste. Tanto esperar ver a HE-MAN. Y vamos a ver a Teela? Es una broma.
Kevin Smith and Netflix can take this woke shit and shove it up their ass.
YES! I remember coming home from school everyday and watching He-Man and the Masters of the Universe at 4:30. I had all the toys too. This is my childhood made manifest. I'm as giddy as a schoolboy watching this!
Please don’t mess up She-Ra 🙏🏽.
Yeah he man is back....now i can hope something good is gonna happen ❤️
Garbage.
So Teela, a normal-ish woman, is going to somehow fight a mindcrontrolled He-man, the STRONGEST MAN in the universe? So all the rumors about this being a feminist puff piece are true after all? Disappointing, I would've loved a new He-man series that was respectful to the source material.
Seen some of this,Netflix is bowing to the left and made it PC HE-MAN. So sad.
So apparently the Kevin Smith series will see He-Man defeated by Skeletor who becomes Skelegod where Teela then becomes the focus and more than likely defeats Skeletor and ends up with the Power Sword becoming "She-Man."
He man
Silence you foolllll!!!! 😂😂
She-Man, Master of the Wokeness
The only thing I find disappointing about this entire thing is that Netflix already rebooted She-Ra and made her a ridiculous cartoony figure, so I don’t really see them making her a part of this series.  That’s a shame.
That's a pass for me.
Iván el trolazo xd
What!!
Omg I’m so ready.
The sword was already broken in two, He-man's and Skeletor's, anyone who owned the toys knows this, they slot together.
What's going on~
I bet money that they will make He-Man bi or gay.  They did the same with with SheRa
*ETERNIA*
Tudo pra ser um lixo total
I need a hero
I'm sold
Yall should do galaxy rangers next
Cartoon trailer reaction: Kids: meh... 40+ year olds: yeah!
I see that Fisto has made a return 😳😳😳😳 hahahahahahahahaha
Bait and Switch
Looks like some woke sjw shit pushing wOmAn PoWeR and ruining he-man for the fellas. What a surprise..nott
I've nothing but the absolute disdain for this show and every other politics vehicle masking as part of a well loved franchise. This should be about escapism, but no, we find pathetic identity politics yet again. Goodbye He-Man, hello Teela? *I've better things to be doing, sorry.*
Cant wait he-man is my childhood cartoon <3
this looks....................................really mediocre.
Holy Sh$% Cringer! I was waiting to see him!
*More pathetic woke horse crap from Netflix.* These social justice warriors care nothing for the franchises they destroy. We now know He-Man has been sidelined for Teela as the main character. Prince Adam has been feminised and has LGBT rainbows coming out of him during transformation. King Grayskull has been illogically colour swapped into a black man because they don't want anymore "White blonde men" on screen. *Boycott this political sideshow if you love this franchise.*
Leaks all but confirm that they're going to make He-Man weak, script leaks about Teela's going to be the strong hero instead of He-Man, and they race swapped King Grayskull which doesn't make sense since he's Prince Adam's ancestor.  The more I hear about it, the more it seems like another woke fest like She-Ra, just there to ruin the series because the writers need a pre-established franchise to push their politics since whenever they make their original IP's nobody buys that crap.  I feel real sorry for all the fans of He-Man, because it seems like the writing is going to let you down.  Atleast the animation looks good
And all of the women have muscles now 🙄
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............
I'm gonna hold off and wait see if what they're saying about this show is true or not. I want "He-Man!" not the "Teela show."
So not only is this show going to pull a bait and switch with Tella being the main character but the show is making King Greyskull, Adam’s Ancestor, into a race swapped person. Instead of expanding on a already established black character or making an original one.
Can we just acknowledge how much that one girl who’s name I can’t remember cannot pull off the punk look. From every angle except head on she looks like a dude from an entirely different show
And I say haeyaheaya hehe heayaheaye i said hey what's going on!
Big❤️ from🇫🇮
well done
1:58 sailor moon transform : /
basicaly the plot is more about this girl than He-man... this will be crap
still no Panthor 😥😥
wait... Nothing of the original song!? WHYYYYYY!!!!!!
He-man is the worst
oh this is gonna SUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
This was supposed to be a He-Man, not She-Man, they already have She-Ra
Please just don't turn this into a SJW show!  I just want a reboot with no political angle or shove down your throat nonsense!
Looks very woke and diverse
This looks...      eh  ..   I'll wait till this comes one out for 'free'..
You should be the fellowship of the ring. Line from the Lord of the rings.
Why do i hear Cersei's voice ayvthe start from GoT
Teela?! I thought it was a dude...
More virtue signal bs. It’s called He Man but he speaks twice and some character I’ve never heard of or remember is narrating.
Day 1
YA ESTY OPINANDO ANTES Q LA DEN, Q SON POCOS EPISODIOS... LABUREN Y HAGAN MAS.
This going to be cancel within 2 or 3 season, just like Thundercats
The He- Man we deserve
Netflix better not drop the ball, we better get a "Secret of the Sword" after this series.
😂 Adam 🤔 face girl jajajaja
He-man must be the true protagonist of the series, and not Tee-la. Netflix and Kevin Smith stinks with so much cheap feminism.
I smell woke shit.
People mentioned stuff like being worried of this turning out to be feminism garbage and they all got valid points but honestly the most thing I hate about this is that the trailer is so boring. It doesn't make me want to watch this. The animation is nice and all but it's just so uninteresting. Heck, they even repeated "Eternia" like a lot of freaking times just at the beginning alone which really put me off. Voice acting is good but their lines are just...ugh, "Eternia will die!" "If I don't do this, Eternia will die" "For Eternia!!!" "Enternia eternia eternia eternia blah blah blah" the lines are very limited and honestly pretty cringe, especially when you remember this is an adult sequel to a kiddy 80s show that was made with the only intention to sell toys. It's too early to judge it but the trailer doesn't give good signs at all.
So cool how HeMan is slowly making a come back, Skeletor, and Castle Grayskull toys make an appearance in the new Boss Baby 2 movie!! 😉
Why do strong women in modern media always have to look like dudes? Like, a woman can be a badass warrior and still embrace her femininity. Sporty and fit women irl still look feminine, after all. Seeing the urge to make every tough woman as masculine as possible nowadays pretty much spits on femininity and I as a woman find this trend rather nasty. Funny enough this trend was started by "feminists" but funfact, telling young girls they need to "man up" and abondon their femininity in order to be strong and independet is a pretty shitty message. Femininity can be strong as well. A woman doesn't need to become a man in order to be strong.
This She-Man trailer is dope
Damn this takes me way back...waaay back.
He-man is the power of the universe.
Been stoked to see this since I found out Mark Bernardin and Kevin Smith were gonna be in the writers room. I can think of few people who write as well as Mark.
I hope they'll add the heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa
there will never be another series like the original, this one sucks
It seems like a good job they've made but there's  something to judge in my opinion. that they have chosen the designs from the 80s for the characters mostly i can understand but i'm not fine with this. I'm from 96 and prefer the designs of 2003. Story could be interesting and i'll watch it definitely. Really good animated in style of castlevania found on Netflix, too.
tá na hora da Netflix trazer um reboot dos Thundercats
Black washing.
Sooo Castlevania Animation, With HE-MAN...YESSSSS!!!!
By the power of gray skull..,..this bring back memories of my childhood
All it was missing is a kick ass rock themed he man theme song. Where was it.
Cringer can talk?🤔
Puta que pariu, essa serie vai ser pica.
Stil know the tune ??
Love the animations. Too bad it's actually Teela's adventures instead of He-Man
Bem fiel ao desenho que top
Teela’s a man now 🤢
Gay but the animation looking pretty cool.
"Still remember the tune?"  "YOU GOT THE TOUCH!"   "I HAVE THE POOOOWWWEEEEEERRRRRR!"
But will this he man be as fabulously Fey as the lat one?
They will ruin it like voltron
Wonder if they are going to follow along with Canon? (i.e The Sorceress is Teela's Mother,Skeletor and Randor are Brothers)?...
Dang he has a Sailor Moon transformation too?  Aight I'm in
Seriously😒 I hope, what this show will be about HE-MAN!!Not about strong woman.I was waiting for a sequel about a muscular man who always screams: I have the power!!😂
Crap. If this is truly for kids, make no mistake the kids  appreciate fantastic animation. This is...
He man I have the power  Teela Hold my beer
If Netflix Ruin this with woke themes, i am Unsubscribing till they release the next season of  witcher. Its HE-MAN, just do something for the men for once.
Well, now I know what will my next D&D game look like...
Even if He - Man isn't the main character I'll stay be happy as there's the other he - Man series as well to come
He-Man???? More like Soy-Man. Black Teela with a manly mug? Check. SJW haircuts? Check. Strong Wahmen with ugly sister mugs from Shrek? Check. Men getting their ass kicked by women? Check.  Redesigned covering costumes? Check. Yep, it is definitely Soy-Man. 80s, I miss you...
Cringer grew some nuts.... Only happens when he becomes battle cat 😅
Excelente.
And I said heyayayayay heyayayay. I said hey, what's going on?
Great old days nice
Well..it's gonna be more serious than the 2002 animated series. And it's in continuity with OG series!
Looks like woke trash to me...
Suprise suprise this show is about anything than He-man. What a load of garbage. I hope this show will flop and cost Netflix a ton of money. Get Woke GO BROKE
Can't wait for the woke reboot: He-ma'am.
Teela feminist, WTF
Woke BS!
Loved watching heman as a kid, now this is awsm, seems like getting back to old days
Something tells me this is going to be not very good.
Dang teela got a manly face.
I’m like a baby in the sweet shop I can’t wait
Why is there such a prominent assumption that they are making this a teela woke show?  Is there something leaked that I don't know about? Coincidentally, I just watched the OG series episode about how teela was the sorceress' daughter and will someday look over everything in the sorceress' place.  Maybe that destiny is what they are exploring with teela?
Hey netflix i am ordering you to stop gaying
Wow wow wow thank you Netflix
Wow wow wow thank you Netflix
Clownfish tv was right. He man isn't the main character in the show and Kevin Smith is a liar... Ugh.
For the most part I like how this looks.  They've got the good guys Roboto, Cringer, Man-At-Arms, King Randor, the Sorceress and He-Man.  I don't like Teela's new look.   The bad guys: Skeletor, Evil Lynn, Beast Man, Tri Clops, and Stinkor appear menacingly on point.  I'm not sure how this new story will fair til I watch this on mid to end of July.  Fingers crossed.
OMG Do I hear Lena Headey and Sarah - Michelle Gellar's voices?! I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!
The original animation was the the best back in the late eighties early nineties, one of my fave cartoons. Check the original one out compared to this one...it looks dated but was  that good considering the amount of reboots it's had...alongside thundercats...another fave
Teela's the lead, Adam looks scared...lame...weak.
Looks terrible. The animations look like a indy console game with a low budget. Much prefer the 80's cartoon!
that fits neither the first trailer nor all the stuff that Keven Smith & Co claimed. Odd.
Love heman cartoons this one looks awsome
The main villain Skeletar is the main hero’s uncle
I shouldn't of expected a good he-man,  from a bunch of people who think masculinity is toxic.
She-man is gonna suck. I had hope,  but it was shattered with this trailer.
Heyheyheyhey what's going on???
I hope that's not a woke serie
Yo I'm so hyped to se heman again
Yep as I suspected ... a show about Teela saving the day... No He-Man to be found... This is a train wreck waiting to happen.
The first trailer got me hyped for a new he man. This unfortunately looks like it’s gonna be the Teela show instead.
YES! Now we need the SILVERHAWKS!
This skeletor's laugh is disappointing
My Childhood memories ❤️😍 he is back 😁 who can forget the line "I HAVE THE POWERRR "
The teaser trailer was *much* more hype than this.
Well, good trailer.... we'll see about the rest
Sooooooo all this Hype!! Of The title for us who seen the original one. This is based on Teela and knowing who He-Man is....
Is this He man?🙄
just dont fak it up with sjw and woke mpoullsit
So does this mean we have a chance to get a thundercats reboot?
FANTASTIC
Just brought goosebumps on my skin 😅 I remember watching He man as a kid 💪
Looks like the Teela show to me!
My childhood hero
Please dub in Tamil...
The Title says it all ... just Master of the Universe. Supposed to be HE-MAN and the Masters of the Universe. They really wanted TEELA and the Masters of the Universe ...
They did She-Ra for Netflix and it is for like 5 year olds.  This looks like it will be an epic tale. It is going to be amazing.
Prince Adam looks like gay. He is totally feminized. Looks rediculous!
OMG! It looks like the rumours were true...this doesn't look like "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe", rather like "Teela and the masters of the Universe". I really hope I am wrong. I just don't understand why politics must modify the nostalgic 80s and make Teela the focus of attention, when the original show centred around prince Adam and his alter ego: He-Man. The thing is that the original tv show even created She-Ra, who was Adam's/He-Man's twin sister, so that girls could also have a heroine as strong as He-Man that could represent them. So why make Teela into the new She-Ra? Like I said, I really hope I am wrong, and that politics didn't influence this remake and it's characters.
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️,
She-man — a PhD thesis on how American society transforms from a male-pre-dominant culture during the 80s to a politically correct one in the 20s! 🙃
I prefer the 80s Teela! Way more attractive and feminine.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh..
Lame draws, lame animation and sailor moon transformation, the music on this trailer sux too. Wish this series got the R classification. Will be another heman lame.
Clownfishtv was right
Pretty soon we gonna have somebody complain about his name not being culturally appropriate or some other load of bollocks.
It's He-Ma'am.
Do you think that Teela will become She-Ra?
I have got to say that nothing beats the nostalgic  cartoon series that we had when were kids.I feel it was more of comdey than violence...hope they got some of the remaining voice actors
So excited for this!!!!
Too anime
Why was the main focus of the trailer the female side character?
Time to watch a "Manly Man wearing only tongs" fighting villains and saving damsel
If this film takes itself too serious, it is bound to fail. It's the corny dialogue, the full-blown childish universe of wonders and magic and not least the (literally) colourful characters like "Clawful", "Two Bad", "Tung Lashor", "Mantenna", "Evil Lyn" and "Man-E-Faces" that took children's toys to a whole new level and even made Star Wars pale in comparison.
Real talk, they had better not make Prince Adam straight.
I hope this is good. The first trailer gave me hope, this one...seemed a little woke. We should all tread lightly, notice it isn't called He-man anymore? I have a feeling he's not going to be saving the day anymore. I hope it's not woke, but I feels like it's tilting that way.
My childhood hero
Ok I’m F’N pumped for this!! Like can’t wait!! Now it’s time for a live action series 👍🏼🤞🏼 after this!
Haba-Man...
About time 👏
If this is WOKE im canceling my Netflix subscription
Looks like He-mans taken some serious roids!
The animation on this looks CHEAP and TERRIBLE! Hard pass and honestly this is an epic fail.
Teela and the Masters of Universe
Everyone wants to turn everything old school heroes  into woman versions .He-Man is next ..new girl version Teela Heman  will be done and finished in this netflix version .
What about the original soundtrack?
He-man was black! or was it She-Man?
This preview is Approved by a 80s baby 💪💪
I can't wait for this! I love the whole He-Man story!!!!!!!
Nostalgia, definitely gonna watch it.
He -Man ,The master of universe
I feel so happy!!!
He Man
HEMAN old carton
Looks lame its Teela and the masters of the universe he man will be a side note
This Teela - Mistress of the Universe trailer looks really good.
Grew up on the 80's animated series. Nothing beats the original.
oh no.. :( more woke propaganda, Master of the Woke :'v
Will NEVER WATCH THIS WOKE SHIT!!!!! 🤣
The  next chapter of Male Body Dysmorphia has Begun!...I can't wait to try to convince my 8 year old that men can't, and shouldn't look like this.
yes!
The final battle? Seriously, after 30 years, going through high school, college, uni, jobs, getting married, kids, etc. the giving us 'the final battle'? Like we don't need some sort of run-up to even get into it? If that's even possible as an adult (depends on how they've written it)...
Nostalgic 🥲🤩
Very cool, now where is Thundercats??!!
I cant see he-man without thinking of I-Van 😂 (Only hispanics would know lmao)
I want Skeletor to win. I dont care what he wins I just want him to have a W
My fav childhood show..He Man
Boring
0:35 great another head banging chick tell me how bad men are,,same shit over n over n over n over  n over n over  n over again,, your message is archaic and overly tiresome to even hear. This franchise will fail And just like a disease socialist will move on the next property because there message has no foundation whatsoever so they need your money and property to succeed. Vote with your wallets,,Boycotting  is the best tool we have.
Next they need to reboot Thundercats and SilverHawks, you listening Netflix?
I'm so excited for this!
So Teela will ask to speak with Skeletor's manager...
By the power of gray skullll. 😎😎😎😎
а чё без дерьмовой пропаганды в мультсериале уже нельзя обойтись. Алё, Нетфликс, где ваши модеры и мозги. Мода приходит и уходит, а классика будет жить вечно, хватит штамповать дерьмо повесточное.
Sooooo is this Teela and the Masters of the Universe or He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.
OMG stinkor is back!!! I got that toy when I was a kid for X-mas and he spent the better part of winter outside because the stench was so bad... whomever designed it went way overboard on the stink but it was AWESOME LOL!
As per usual the trailer shows way too much and ruins a big surprise.
It Looks Amazing!!....Is The Other Half Of The Sword Going To Be Given To Teela And Then She Becomes Similar To She Ra But With Another Name Like Te Ra😬😅🤣
How much money can childhood nostalgia make. Apparently a lot
Looking good. So, so good.
What the hell is with that hairstyle Teela supports? I don't mind giving her a bigger role, but why that stupid overused ugly hairstyle, why they gotta shave the side of their head? To make it more tactical? They want tactical they should just go bald. no hair to pull during battle.
theres no nothing better than the original one
They couldn't do this for Thundercats a few years ago?
Na potęgę posępnego wpierdolu! Jestem wszechmocny!
Vaya pero que buena animacion...😮 me gusta...😉👍
Even though they already did a She-Ra series, I think they should redo her for a new She-Ra series and integrate her into this new He-Man series, because they just did her so wrong and made Hordak look like a pansy, the Hordak from the 2002 He-Man and the original Hordak was Badass compared to Princess Hordak.
"Still remember the tune?"  "YOU GOT THE TOUCH!"   "I HAVE THE POOOOWWWEEEEEERRRRRR!"
Why does Teela look so manly?  Her look should have been based off of the 2002 cartoon.  Besides that though everything else looks cool.
Looking forward to this….
She-ra? me want she-ra.
I just hope what happened to star wars doesnt happen here
I say hey what’s going on
So is he going to use both swords probably not I was wish fully thinking
I know nothing about He-Man, but this looks pretty dope.
Looks like the leaks were true after all...
This is a lot like the 2002 series and the 1987 movie in the mix. I’ll check this out.
Aren't we gonna talk about the god tier animation in this??hopefully the whole series is gonna be good like the trailer
Teela: Still remember the tune? Me: Ta ta ta ta...ta ta ta taa raa ta ta... tar ra ta ta...ta ta ta...tara ra rat...Heman.
One major thing is missing... The title track which gave all 80 90s kids goosebumps... Bring that back please
He- Man...
The he-Man story turns to Black Star. Lol
Excited
So looks like now She-Man and the MOTU, He-Man has less screen time in trailer than She-Man lol
😲
So the "power" is transforming from a twink to a bear?
Teela's SJW look = 🤮
HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN
Teela seems like a man. Big arms, angular face. I think those who say that we live in a misogynistic age are indeed correct, because I have never seen such hatred towards what is FEMININE. Now even women have to look like men.   And the strangest thing is that the people who support this obfuscation of the feminine are those who say they are against misogyny. For I say they are the true misogynists, as they associate femininity with weakness and impotence, and so they need to make every strong woman look like a man.
Soooo Tela is now a lesbian? Just make your own show! No reimagining!!!🤦🏿‍♂️✊🏿
So many complaints and imagined slights about something the public hasn't even seen yet. So many people placing a cheap old cartoon designed to sell toys on a pedestal. Meanwhile, this animated series looks and sounds _GREAT_  -- even as a kid I couldn't get into the original cartoon, but THIS looks fun, clever and amazing.  Quit complaining and get happy that someone cares enough about a piece of your childhood to revive it. If you don't like it...quit complaining, stream the original, and have fun stuck in the past.
Can’t watch one show or movies these days with some gay lgbt in it, this is why me and most people rather play video games than watch tv, repent JESUS is coming soon
I just looked up the definition of EPIC and got to this page.
No tiger i am disappointed
Why do I get the distinct impression this was made for adults?
heyaya
Is it me or its look like heman cartoon 😬
I got bored *during the trailer.* Not a good sign.
Looks arrite, story wise. Just wish the animation style was less bulky and more smooth.
Nice!  Looks like fans got finally heard.  After years and yeats of back and forth between various movie projects. Producers realized that the only way to present the world of He-Man is the cartoon way.  I mean, I really like the schlocky live action movie fron the 80s. 😅
Por favor não passa isso a série he-man ótima os desenhos antigos deles são ótimos Não faça isso vai estragar o desenho Tá sério demais
And besides it seems pretty obvious that it's not mainly about he man considering it's called masters of the universal revelation
Just because it's not mainly about he man doesn't mean it's not about it I think we should watch the whole show before assuming it's going to be bad just because he man is not the main character
Woke He-man sucks
Teela don't look hot on this cartoon, she look like a lesbian . Not like this cartoon at all
Rename the series "Teela becomes Karen."
The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again" would fit nicely in this trailer. Particularly the second synth pattern, drum solo & scream.
Why the fk do they always try to ruin already created cartoons by bringing all kinds of "today's crap" in them? Leave them as they are or create the same thing in some other style. They should just create a new cartoon and put all kinds of "Today's crap" in it and create a fan following if possible.!
Poor animation, nothing like Korra Legend!
Please keep feminism out of my cartoons
Well reading the comments, I didn't hear Skeletor say, "Hah just like a woman". Which leads me to believe two things, one...they purposely made the bad guy say something anti feminist, and two, Netflix removed it because it was anti feminist. In a nutshell, woke liberals are going to subliminally ruin childhoods.
Heman great skull
Teela has been defiled.
Asthikoodan rockzz!!
is it heman??
For ETERNIA !!!
I was half expecting he-man died and a black woman takes his place.
He-Man is back😁
Why they all are  white?
опять фемку мужичку засунули!(
Remember people, you don't have to watch this trash.  Don't give the excuse of "oh, I'll take a bullet for the team", no, no-one needs to get shot watching this SJW woke pile of crap.  That's the reason Hollywood keeps churning out this junk.  Just don't watch.  It's not going to be anything like your childhood beloved He-Man, at all, it can't be, it won't be.
I am actually terrified that this may ruin one of my most favorite super hero franchise ... Let us hope not!
Since I have been introduced to Japanese Manga and Japanese Anime I have lost taste in these types of cartoons.
Heman and thundercat collqbs
Wait a second. Is he man brainwashed?
It seems women's role would be much more than He-Man, or Men this time...
I am waiting for you👍👍👍
1:54 is hope
She-Man incoming...
Best holivood movi  Hi man.
Why do the girls look like dudes?
wait? isn't this HE man? why They didn't put HE man's name HE MAN???
"wat?"
As long as there aren’t any episodes about a circus.
😂🤣😉 the most powerful Zim/Zer in the universe!!!
So it's Teelas show. Got it.  🙄
Everybody wondering if Teela will steal the show and I am just here thinking « Holy crap ! Is Orko actually showing his true power ?! »
Apesar de que eu queira uma produção nostálgica é tudo mais,Esse trailer não me deixou animado não, parece até que vão da protagonismo pra Tila é não pro He-man 😒😔
Just need a remaster of the original series.
Myaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
MY OATS!
is jitsu there if stinkor is?
Kevin Smith owes ClownFish tv an apology
Iam the only one who didn't like the He man sword design. Tha last He man series sword was so awesome.
Kevin Smith sold out...... Well sad. TEEMAN SHOW it is
Wow!
Skeletor looking different.
heman season 2 ??
Need to rename this "Teela and The Masters of the Universe" Why bother calling it He-man when Teela is the show runner now?
Is this made NY ppl who made Shera. Sinilar animation
Loved the teaser trailer more than this. Whatever spark I had just went away. RIP He-Man 😔
Eagerly waiting for my childhood show 😍
I'm already seeing better animation in this than record of Ragnarok.... I was really pissed when Netflix took it sigh
Don't worry He-Man, Teela is here to save you, wanted why they dropped He-Man from the title of masters of the universe revelation
Teela and the masters of the universe...
Still know the tune 😀
ഗ്രെസ്സൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നുള്ളിൽ ഒതുകും ശക്തി പുറത്ത് വാ..... 😂😂😂😂💥💥💥
I'm glad there is a strong woman in this show for He Man to look up to
THE MEME SHOW HAS RETURNED
Man bad, karen hair SHE-MAN gonna save the day.
0:50 looks like a lot of He-men. I see a black king gray skull, I see a Conan the barbarian look alike and someone else near prince Adam in this scene. I’m intrigued by it now. That’s pretty much all the male legends in one shot.
I am guessing this is gonna be a "Teela Show" since Netflix have another series called "He-Man and The Masters of the Universe" that's CGI and more kiddie looking?  It have He-Man on it's title and this one does not have.
Its heman in name only, woke s h I t I wont be watching
Soy un trolazoooooo!  -Ivan.
Looks great
Where is Orko kurwa mać?
I bet that guy from menudo is pumped
Why did they change the cross on He-Man to an H?
let me guess main character is gay
They forgot to draw the balls on Teela
ஏஸ்கல் கோட்டையின் சக்தியே.... என்னுள் இருக்கும் சக்தியேயேயே.......🌩⚡⚡🗡🗡🗡⚡⚡🌩
where did bonnie tyler go?
Netflix is trying it's best to copy japanese anime, However they couldn't come even close..
I don't mind the gains on Teela, she fights with a sword I expect her to be at least a little ripped but the Karen hair is very VERY concerning.
I'm a 70's baby so I grew up with He-Man killing him or making him a bitch would be messing with my childhood
This trailer has more action than all the 80`s stuff combined
Too much Teela, not enough He-Man
Won't watch. He-man wasn't a gay But as the head of Netflix is a gay so they made She-Ra a lesbian.  They will do the same to he-man and my childhood hero fantasy will die.
Not gonna lie this actually looks lit so ima let this one pass
Y'ALL REVIVING HE-MAN
Sorry but nothing beats the original He Man. Nostalgia wins every time. Even the original music was better.
So this is where adora brother was the whole time
Nostalgia..♥
Teela & the masters of the universe dark fate revelation.
Graiscal കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി 💥🥳
Dragon booster pls
We love you Kevin and thank you
Return of the Masters of the Universe-All
That laugh
He man and Masters of the universe look more aesthetic than this  Ooh I miss my childhood
Ah yes cant wait for the meme
I was waiting fr the hemans intro i am the power where his cat becomes a tiger too!!
When will thundercats come?
Why he looks like simon Belmont castlevania lol
is it REMAKE or REBOOT???
Armin is back guys you know him he killed attack Titan and now he is Savin world again....
Loved He-man during doordarshan days....
When turning into heman 2002 adam looks like a trained prince who needs to become  strong  New Adam looks like a rich kid who tried steroids to impress a girl
This always will better than She-Ra Princess of Feminists and LGTB+
he-man
If they make this all about teela and he man falls to the side I swear Netflix I’m so done with you
Why so many dislikes?
Девочки: Нереалистичные стандарты красоты. Парни: Хочу быть как Хи-Мен
I have of power.
We need ThunderCats next somebody PLEASE PLEASE an one more PLEASE 🙏🏾
Looks like Joker got an upgrade.
Let me guess the female character will be perfect in every way.
He man
Why is Teela a lesbian?
"Somethings you can never forget".......
Can we please get Kengan Ashura Part III.
Eternia eternia eternia🤣
Chills!
Still missing the dope original music though☹
Maybe they do a Netflix series of Galtar and the Golden Lance...if He-Man is successful
Vai ser mais uma bosta com lacração, a Tyla vai virar a Keith Machone e o Adam o Gay-man, vcs acabaram com um clássico da minha infância, seus acéfalos loucos por homosexualismo!!!!!
Kevin is soooo over rated.
Drinking game: every time they say Magic you take a shot
If you’re a fan of he man then don’t watch this woke garbage. Rebel and take to Twitter as well as other online outlets!!
Oh boy, I cant wait to see how empowered the wahmen of the show are going to be!  My non-binary children will love this. Its so hard to find shows with  strong and independent female characters these days thanks to the patriarchy controlling everything.
He-Man is gonna cut his back sheathing his sword like that 😆
Hellllll yeah can't wait.... Childhood memories refresh again.
This is the first MoTU I’ve seen other than the other trailer so I don’t know much. But as of now I’m cautiously optimistic because it doesn’t seem that they’re completely sidelining Adam/He-Man. Sure it sucks he isn’t main character like he used to but it still looks enjoyable
Right, so, the "He-Man" part of the title has been removed from "The Masters of the Universe"... We have a female character with a 'modern day feminist styled' (or what is widely known as) hair style. A lot more female 'empowered' characters... Don't get me wrong, I am ALL FOR equality, be it gender (but not for the ridiculous amount, what is it now 30 genders???), race, age and whatever, BUT, as like anything social media, Hollywood, films & TV... It's getting STUPID with the amount of OVERCOMPENSATING that's going on... 🤔😒😒
And i say heeyyeeeheheheye
Yea yea yea yea yea
Polii
Please God don't make this go woke and keep its integrity preserved...
All these nerds in the comments getting preemptively offended 😣😰 🤣🤣
Dubbed this in tamil
Malayalam vnm
DD Metro memories in Hindi.  Would love to see this again
Woke shit
This is probably where the animation is good, but the story sucks so bad I am rooting for Skeletor to win.
Dammit, "Strong Woman" is going to spend the whole show overshadowing He-Man isn't she?
Wow because of course the female is the hero and the male hero is the antagonist, of course!  Get your f-ing shit together, netflix
Idk why I thought this was Thunder Cats…
I want Bonnie Tyler's theme
Paridse PD season 4 batter be in the work
Wow such a pleasant surprise.
“HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN” - Skeletor
AnTeela, straight outta Portland.
He-man ??? 😱😱😱 İt's very amazing
This'll be better than shera
Man, Teela looks more like He Man then Adam does. Indeed she already has the "feminist" haircut.  Is this gonna be like the She Ra cartoon where they're too afraid to make the female characters...actually look female?  Well, it's already clear they're gonna throw He man to the side and make her the main.
He-Man us why I would watch it. If they did anything to my childhood, won't even pirate this shit.
Boo.  They changed his chest piece.
He-man.. 🤩
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
i'll not watch this lol.... im a grown man.......lol   ....... ........ .................     ................lol
OMG my childhood
“HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN” - Skeletor
BRITANNIA 😂🤣🤣😆🙂
Ith he-man alle
I've never seen a more exiting remake in my life
Jojoooooooo..
This looks so sick
Like He-man in kushi TV
the meme remake
sad truth of the matter is they couldn't just give us a continuation of the original He-Man. Changes had to be made to freshen up the story or it would fail. I was thinking more He-Man losing some of his power making his execution of heroic feats unreliable. He's still the man but needs help in a major way. At the same time an enemy stronger than Skeletor shows up because of the imbalance in power he's been waiting on for years. It's simple but if set up properly would have been entertaining to watch. Throw in a good story twist (He-Man's power was originally used for evil and almost destroyed Eternia) and you're set. Hopefully the show is much better than that.
wait cringer talks
Fans to Netflix: Lets do a he man tv show Netflix: amazing idea lets do it… Fans: yeeeaah Netflix: but lets just but he man in it as little as possible Fans: ????
Can this series available in hindi
why did "for eternia" sound like that 😭
Awaiting 🤗
Blast from the past!
Kevin Smith is a scumbag liar.
Watching this makes me wanna rewatch the thundercat remake a few years ago
Wow, they even made the girls bulky.
Isit woke now?
The show is not about He-man.
They should of kept the original "I have the power" it just sounds stupid in this one
goosebumps
The other sword would have been better.
She-man the defender of castle gay skull🏰 🌈 💀 and the masters of  all the SJWs, LGBT, feminists, communists, of the universe.
lol wow utter utter garbage.
Trash.
SJW wins again. It's ok for the male protagonist to be 80% naked, but the female character can no longer have any skin showing and can't have their classic leotards anymore.
why can i not put more than one like come on youtube
So many people were knocking Kevin Smith, but this looks hot! I only hope The Masters, are Masters this time around!
too bad its porbably gonna be all about teela
Still know the tune?   And i say hey yeah yeah and i say what's going on?
BraWO NeT.. Nice propaganda. Go W go B.
Why teela looks like a man?
It's like the HeMan which we used to watch in our child hood..... Isn't it HeMan??
You don’t have the Power!!
Quero o trailer br com Garcia Junior
Oh yeah
Id rather not have my memory destroyed by leftist agenda. Think ill pass
I hope they pay homage to heyyeyeye
🤩
I am so lucky to be an 80's kid. That is all.
Hell yeah, a he-man anime. A he-manime?
Che figata ETERNIA!!!!!!!!
Looks like the producer lied. This show is woke.
This will be bad, one of the creators Kevin Smith lied about beeing a fan, so i will predict this will be another sjw show. Ill pass
Ok so why did they have to make it like an anime? If they let the creators of shera do a masters of the universe, there could have been crossovers
Why is his chest logo changed?
Wow,,,, amazing 👍👍👍👍I never thought this kind of series will be back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heeeeeeee Man
and i said hey, whats going on
This is what we deserved instead of she – RA
She-Rah better team up or I be mad.
Come on, people… just leave some things alone.
After all this yrs he still have the same hair style, except it has a little bit of anime in it
I love whoever Netflix gets to do it's animation. Top notch.
0/10 Skeletor didn't Nyehehehehe.  Also watch Clownfish TV videos about this.
Why didn't he point his sword towards the tiger, I'm disappointed.
It's heman
This feels almost like a parody of gritty reboots considering how light-hearted the original show is haha
If they don't somehow include the tune I will be very very disappointed.
"I HAVE THE POWER !!!!"
Well looks like, H-Man gets his ass kicked in first 5 min, and then Teela will carry him through the whole series... in the end she get him his sword back, he roids up kicks Skeletor and series ends....
Im so ready
This has She-Man written all over it!!!
I hate English dubbed anime.
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA remake when?
Wow even he man now got cast aside. As far i know since a kid . This show was about he man not some chick flick. Damn you  kevin smith better not screw the show .
Heyayaya
I really dislike the redesign of Teela. 😕😕😕
Have a horrible feeling it’s just gonna be woke BS
My fake spidey senses are tingling and it's telling me to lower my expectations and brace for disappointing unwanted changes to the lore.
The hype is real.
wow brining a dead ancient meme back to life,  only netflix can think of something like this
So. let me get this straight.  1)he-man dies 2)sword split into two swords that look sorta feminine 3)teela picks up those swords and becomes the new mc while ending the male one because he is corrupted or some shit 4)Its can be easily seen from a mile away as the only character that had art change is Tesla only. who look like how woke women are shown in recent movies
This was definitely needed.
Classic heman looked cooler.. this feel too modern like a game lol
Animation looks great but I was expecting brutality like castlevania since you know, it's on Netflix.
well this is just not gonna do it
Hey man... wth is this junk?
don't like the graphics...  why not go oldschool keeping He-Man as we all knew the guy back in the 80s
He man
Silent Bob is trash and so is this HeMan
white, main character will be female? Pls no
Looking forward to hearing Mark Hamils voice acting during the oatmeal scene😏
He-Man reboot made Fans: woo!  Netflix: oh no no no no we can’t have any of that.
💩💩💩👎🏼
25 years of my life and still I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination I realized quickly when I knew I should That the world was made of this brotherhood of man For whatever that means And so I cry sometimes When I'm lying in bed Just to get it all out What's in my head And I, I am feeling a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning And I step outside And I take a deep breath and I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? Uhh, uh, uhuhuh uhuhuh Uhh, uh, uhuhuh uhuhuh And I try Oh my god do I try I try all the time In this institution And I pray Oh my god do I pray I pray every single day For a revolution. And so I cry sometimes When I'm lying bed Just to get it all out What's in my head And I, I am feeling a little peculiar And so I wake in the morning And I step outside And I take a deep breath and I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? And I say: Hey yeah yeaaah! Hey yeah yeah. I said hey, What's going on? Uhh, uh, uhuhuh uhuhuh 25 years of my life and still I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination
More woke trash nothing to see.
eternia dies 99% animation 1%
They tried...
More woke feminatzi and gender trash bs nothing else. Thank you Netflix for destroying this one as well.
i still dont understand the hate of "this is going to be all about teela" stuff. im sure plenty of side characters will get bigger roles. and dont hate to hate. would you rather have it look like this and have teela have a bigger role or have something like thunder cats roar? yea understand your b*tching before you do it.
Finally someone brought heman back
Goosebumps
He man
No thanks, I'll pass. I was expecting a He-Man revival, not a She-Man woke trashfire.
This better be better than Netflix attept at Transformers.
So powerful, every word in the title is trademarked!
Feminism is killing all
Trailer is great. Now lets see if the program is any good. From the reports, it may not be. The new Teela SUCKS.
So the sword got split? BS reason for a new He-Man
Oh oh oh!! Hero hei covered about this!!
"Everything comes to he who waits...and I have waited so very long for this moment!"
netflix and heman looks like heman.... i smell a large sum of money here
We just need GI Joe and Inspector Gadget and my Saturday will be complete again.
I don't think they understand that we don't have anything against a strong female lead. Hell, Salt (Angelina Jolie) is one of my favorite movies to date. But don't change what was already good for some "woke agenda".
“Holy shit” In my Eric cartman voice
It's dangerous not giving fans what they really want. Merchandise sales will take a hit.
1:47 LOL who voiced that? that was terrible
"Masters of The Universe"??? or The Teela Show??????? 😴
Holy crap. He-man used to be pretty buff with bulging muscles back in the day but now hes just ridiculous. He is now so buff that even his muscles now have muscles of their own.
As for me I'm hyped for this... It's been a long time for HeMan
Idk. This seems way different than the Masters of the Universe I remember. Seems it got infected by wokeness and the essence is lost. No masculine lead unless it’s a female. HeMan plays second fiddle and I’d wager he is portrayed as a buffoon requiring the guidance of a female lead. I’m sure we will suffer all kinds of virtue signaling and plenty of non-binary characters. The days of the strong white male lead are reduced to fantasy and fantasy won’t even give us that anymore.
“HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN” - Skeletor
WAT
So whats next, Adam wears panties on rainbow colors?
IVANNN
Heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman heman is cool.
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed Just to get it all out what's in my head And I, I'm feeling a little peculiar  And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take a deep breath and get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's goin' on?  And I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay Hey, yay, yay I said hey, what's goin' on?  And I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay Hey, yay, yay I said hey, what's goin' on?  And he tries Oh my God, do I try I try all the time In this institution  And he prays Oh my God, do I pray I pray every single day (Nyaaah) For a revolution! And I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay Hey, yay, yay I said hey, what's goin' on?  And I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay Hey, yay, yay I said hey  (Don't cry out loud) (Just keep it inside And learn how to hide your feelings)  (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay) (Hey, yay, yay) Hey hey hey I say hey What's goin' on? Yeah!
Another Woke and Broke movie.
For all the talk of people think He-man getting erased out of the show, this footage shows him in several completely different areas, the Castle, the jungle and a ship. Seems like that could take several episodes.
So this is supposed to be a sequel to the last one, correct?
"Y recuerden amigos, si el remastered no funciona en Netflix nos vamos pa' HBOMAX, hasta la próxima amigos" - el He-Man
Esto no es He-Man, se trata sobre Tila no le mientan al público
You know a girl is tuff when her hair is cut short
1:55 im legit crying right now
Rhis looks like Chaotic season 2
So much not good of having dialogue and strong script...
Where is the magical music
He-man❤️❤️
Winner: He-man Loser: She-ra
Can't believe the made this into a. Anime
I wonder if they'll do the snake people faction
I knew Kevin Smith was lying, stupid ass went and made Teela the protagonist, and even gave her the ugly ass shaved head to go with it.
Could listen to Lena Headey acting all day! She is always a joy to watch/listen to in any role.
Looks amazing
Looks like another childhood show got the sjw cringe filter installed.... I’m out
Where's the blood?
A whole lot of Teela talking throughout this trailer, almost nothing from He-Man.  I guess the series tone has been set.
seguramente ahora skeletor intentara ACABAR con heman -te doy 30min para que me sueltes
So they now making TV series on me after 30 long years... 😂😎
Meh….  Another attempt that misses the mark.  Is it really that difficult to capture the original feel yet make it modern without bypassing the main character focus in the process? Apparently.   Couldn’t even get the rights to the original sound track.  😒
Are the rumors true? Is this gonna be some woke "The Force is Female" type of shit they used in starwars? I hope not.. if they dont want to focus on He-Man, atleast Focus on my boy skeletor..
boobless girls ...NEXT!!!!!
Awesome, cant wait to see this series, i used to eagerly wait for Sundays on DD during childhood in the 1980s & used to unleash all my power to take the TV hostage. Heman will always be my childhood Hero :)
👏👏👏👏👊👍
Tá muito épico... 😱😱😱
"After a calamitous battle fractures Eternia, *Teela* and an unlikely alliance must prevent the end of the Universe in this sequel to the ’80s classic."
Don't ruin my childhood. Please disney already did a number with star wars He Man must live fck around and find out Netflix
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
Continuation of Blood of Zeus?
OMFG I JUST NUTTED ! This looks so good !
Hope none of that woke shit ends up in there to ruin yet another perfect original series. He-Man traditionally ends with him telling everyone some hard truths about the challenges he has had to face...would be great if this could continue without a stinking Woke narrative.
Kevin smith: it’s gonna be the best he msn movie ever! Reality: it’s not about heman. Films gonna bomb. I’ll never get why anyone listens to a shit stain like smith who habitually lies.
Omg is Ivan el trolazo
Hoping they'll sneak in a "so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take a deep breath and get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's goin' on?"
I just hope we dont degrade he man to boost Teela up and he is more like a goku where he is on his way to save the day. Plus why Teela gotta rock the same hair every single female tough girl has its just some bad lazy design man people use it wayy to much. Other wise looks good.
She-Ra fans: *starts complaining about He-Man and his TV show*  He-Man fans: _I don’t care. This show is lit!_
PRECISO     VER      ISSO
And why the hell does Teela look like a man, and have a butch lesbian half-buzzcut ??  Do they even remotely understand who their target audience is ?  And if they go full woke and turn the show into "Teela and dumb male background characters" it will lose 90% of viewers before the season is out.  You can see that Netflix management is infested with activists who care only for pushing their cause, and not about making decent product. I am already out.  This cartoon is dead on arrival like that batwoman farce on CW.
Animation looks corny, & outdated...
Ready now!!!!
Why do I feel like it’s a big setup.
Jokes on you I’m into that shit
SERIOUSLY, WHY NOT JUST USE THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK WHEN HE-MAN TRANSFORMS???? MUCH BETTER THAN THIS CRAP.
Can She-ra make a cameo?
It almost looks like Teela has become a lesbian SJW...I hope the story isn't centred around her...
This is looking like leftist woke garbage with teela being the main character and he-man being a supporting character. Sad.
It's the hundredth time I've seen this trailer since it came out. I'm very excited
Shut up and take my money
This looks so sick.
Me encanta ver a He Man, pero la animación esta muy floja Inviertan en buenos animadores Netflix!!
Are this eh is pronouns? If so toxic masculinity at its best.
1:50 "HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA" intensifies
Oh great, gonna make this character bi or gay as well?   Hard pass.
Of course you had to make it about  a woman, having a young blonde big boy for protagonist it's to much for this Woke generation I guess
Shithouse trailer. Too choppy, made it look weak with no depth
It sucks that he doesn’t have a nice place to put his sword
I don't like the story or the animation.
Im getting goosebumps watching this
Is this the same a thunder cats?
I SAID HEY HEY HEY HEY I SAID HEY HEY HEY I SAID HEY 👋🏻 WHATS GOING ON…
The animation tho...umm...yeah...pass.
damn would have been a perfect chance to make the main character transgender and call them "She-man" smh why am I never consulted on things like this
He-Man: We Have GIrls Too EDIT: dat Mark Hamill
Women trying to hard to look like men now a days.
100% netflix made He-man gay transgender non binary
Seems like it's going for Woke points.... This is worrying.... The animation also seems to be kind of lacking in some areas.
anoob question, is this a marvel anime?
What I get from this trailer is that this show is insanely predictable and generic. Oh well...Still gonna watch it with the kids though.
The thing is, if it were a different character besides Teela that was going to be the main character, nobody would give a shit. Ryan was the main character in Wilfred. Arthur was the main character in The Tick. Nobody bitched. The only reason people are pissed now is because TEH GIRLZ ARE IN CHARGE!  You people are such losers.
Woke. Woke. Woke. Do I sound incel enough yet? Looks like fun.
drop.
don't care to see it this batwomen ms marvel crap is lame to me
Excellent direction. I cant wait to see the other shows from this time rebooted.
Guys, you need to stop saying "woke" so much. Seriously, I'm playing a drinking game, and you're gonna give me alcohol poisoning.
He man better be the main character in his own series
And Another peace of my 80's Dies to the woke SJW Horse Shit Mob  !!!GOT DAM IT!!!!
Bait and switch in full effect.
So do we get to see his sister She Ra?
Want a good thundercats show like this, the last anime looking one was not very tastfull, still love the old 80s thundercats💙💙
Well now Kevin has officially ruined a series with amazing potential due to the inability to understand why the OG fans loved it, as well as the inability to write a good story without throwing woke trash in the mix.
Why they have to go woke it’s not going to be good stop being woke please
Anyone notice skeletor is disguised as spikor in the trailer?
Tread carefully Netflix
This is horrible, the animation is great but the story sucks balls.  If this show is good I will say so but until I watch it. What I am seeing is horrible. The Liar and crier Mr. Smith (Corporate Guy) has F'd this up real bad so far.
Hindi dubbed it plz Netflix
0:20 Huh... sounds familiar.
AND I SAID HEYHEYHEYHEYHEY
Teela: still know the tune? Me: some things, you can never forget. Me again: Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats Xooooooooo
I hope that Shera makes an appearance voiced by Aimee Carrero!
Not bad, but for those of us who remember the original,  it juuuust misses. The original had adults playing the parts in a children's cartoon believably.  This is a reach to millennials  to capitalize on a once successful ( legendary ) series...... good luck with that.....🙄🙄🙄🙄
Wonder how the “bitches” at Netflix will try make this one also woke🧐🤗..😖
Divided? What they gave teela the other half lmao. Ya this is gonna be some more sjw trash crapping on classics.
Trivia. Here in Brazil this cartoon series will be called Masters of the Universe: Saving Eternia.
The half shaved head on chicks is getting old🤦🏽‍♂️
Aw, shit - really???
Netflix = w-ke streaming service to push "strong female character" propaganda.
He-man will be a side character in this show.
So many sexist babies jumping to conclusions....
Is this all bout teela
Wamens of the W0ke-verse.  What a joke.  Kevin Smith is a fake fan.
"Some things never change, and some things do."
1:32  Skeletors staff now looks... like a gender symbol?
Please for the love of everything just let he man be the main character and see what happens cause I'm going to be sad if Tesla is the main character I mean nothing against her but this isn't she ra she had her show we dont want a repeat
And another series going down the drain
What a lot of bullcrap this is. I had my hopes up that this would be true to the orginal show, but at the same time I feared it would just be another ruining of a classic cartoon, like all those Transformers incarnations. The seccond were sadly true. Why is there that nobody can replicate the magic from the 80's cartoons today ? Everything is twisted and turned to the unknown. I keep saying to my friends etc that no one made cartoons like in the 80's. The production, animations, the music. After the 90's went nobody makes a even remolty as they did in the 80s and 90s.. At least I have all the orginal episodes on my harddrive. Time to copy them over to an usb drive and watch it on my TV with my kids.
There can no longer be shows aimed at boys/young men solely.
Brought to you by those who produced cuties.
1:15 you can be sure anything made today will have w0ke propaganda and as you can see they checked off all the boxes to insert "strong female character" propaganda to satisfy the femcels who live alone with their cats and can't get a man
Am I the only one getting a bad vibe from this? Looks like a deconstruction not a loving tribute to me...
Welp this has feminist agenda written all over it. 🤦🏿‍♂️
who else rewinds @ 1:38 ?
Show looks very well animated and has quite the voice cast.... $5 says they botch the hell out of the toyline
🤩He-Man will always be in our hearts as a child, but Conan the Barbarian🗡 is the test of adolescence to a more brutal fantasy world...by Crom!!💪
This is fantastic! Dat Teela tho.  SPOP She-Ra after hearing the second sentence: Am I a joke to you?
So is this a continuation of the 2000s series or something entirely new?
Teela disgraça!!!!!
The lord of not being nice is finally back
PLEASE DONT MAKE IT ABOUT TEELA!!!!
That's what prince Adam should've look like back in the 80s, a young boy cause he looked the same on the original cartoon where people were asking why they couldn't c that prince Adam & he-man were the same because the way they look
Woke
Lol
Dolph said it better.  I admit I actually liked the live action movie with Dolph Lundgren from the 80's.
Ya valió...🤷‍♂️
So... it will not be He-man but She-man. Not pun intended.
Cadê o Ariat?
Nostalgia
Except the main character: all women -good,  all man - villan. Hmm...  I think they'll get degraded at some point in time...  Also please dislike this trailer
Based on intro narration they should call this Game of Universes.
Unless he uses his sword to cut a dude in half vertically I didn't see this going that far.
I see they still get the Transformation wrong as usual every time
He-Man!?
I hope there's more to the transformation to he- man than what they just showed. All the past versions have always fell short to me compared to the original series. The buildup, then the sound, then the visual and the sound always made it one of the reasons you watched he-man. Just to watch him change, lol. Unfortunately the later versions just don't hit like the original used too.
this looks promisingly good,  ok, next up do the Galaxy Rangers and Bravestars
I hope Masters of the Universe don´t being destroyed like disney Star Wars trilogy
I have to see it!
To portrait a stong woman you cut her hair make her mad all the time and make her as manly as you can,  Thank you Netflix.
you better not screw this up Netflix,  like you messed up on she-ra,
Amazing, but hol up, we gon need a thundercats series too y'know dattebayo
I-VAN!!!!
If Skeletor doesn't say "MYAAH" I ain't watching
I guess calling the show HE MAN was not okay, right? too patriarcal?
IVAN SAPEEEEEEEEE
Is this isekai???
Dont disapoint the fans, dont play with the nostalgia and f*ck it up, so far, good plot, good animation....!!!!
Ahh, so Teela is a man now. Interesting choice.
Actually looks rather good EXCEPT I hate the Prince Adam change to He- Man. That isn't even close to the original cartoon change. That change was totally unnecessary. Looks and sounds shitty.
I'm sceptical, they'll subvert my expectations if they make an actual good show. Loved me some Voltron so fingers crossed 🤞
Que delicia !!!!!
Does Princess Adora make an appearance?
I hope they don’t mess this up like they did She-Ra. My 10, 9, and 7 nieces don’t even like the new one they had . They Prefer the original one which I have the DVD collection of and love that more to the point my nieces didn’t want to gave back so so let them kept it.
Some of the prettiest false advertising I’ve ever seen
This is ether gonna be good or more sjw pandery trash  please please let it be good  I'm not feeling too hopeful with how much more screen time and dialogue teela got in the trailer over he-man, and the rest of the cast barely getting a few nods.
Where was Battle Cat????????????????????
So another one bites the dust😒
Me: where is Skeletor? where is Skeletor? 1:35 Here is my HERO! :D
HE-MAN NO ES EL PROTAGONISTA?...NI UN BRILLO SI SERIE FEMINISTA.
Is this new series going to primarily star Teela or He-Man? 😕
Rumor says he-man is going to be gay in this one..
Tem coisa boas aí, mas vai ser uma merda.  Pô, focar na Teela? Tem chance de ser bom? Tem, mas na Netflix, não creio.
I'm 8 years old again
He man used the dumbest and gayest thing in existence now it's a kickass anime!😆
Of course, Teela has been heavily masculinized. Typical for female characters in western media these days.
I never expected they would redo he man
Teela is the main character, this is a bait
La generacion de cristal se sentira ofendida por el cuerpo "demasiado musculoso"de HE MAN por que son ejemplos atleticos muy dificiles de alcanzar para ellos
me gustan las chicas
I can hear Buffy. That means I'm watching it.
I wonder if they'll still rekindle that magic of the 80's by having the little messages to us at the end of each show!?...                    ...."Now remember friends..."
I'm...I'm...cautiously optimistic?  Please, Netflix, I've been hurt so many times before...
Anybody seen Orko?
Why they remove the cross that he man  had?
Still know the tune? HAYAYAYAYAAAAAAAAA I SAY HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
woke
She-Man and the Multi-Ethnic Middle Managers of the Gender Inclusive Universe
No like ,no like no like , you're going to load up on the mythology of He-man and the masters of the universe.  You're going to give us Tee-lo and the mistresses of the universe.  The series looks like a truño, you're going to ruin the story.
Ai meu corassaum
Lol, these comments are hilarious. A single trailer, and people are already dumping on the series.  Mattel trusted Kevin Smith and the writers to tell a great story within the confines of the lore. They are a toy company, so of course the overall goal is to sell toys, but it's an IP that they are pretty protective about and wouldn't just ask anyone to work on it.  Here's a wild thought: wait for the first episode to debut. I know it's a foreign concept to not have any preconceived notions, but try, ok?
He-man without calling it he-man to avoid cringe drama
It's he man I watched it when I was a kid
Pass...
It would be nice if you don't say "Eternia" 500 times in 2 minutes, and how super super important you and what you are doing is 5 times, I got it the first one, thanks!
I thought the show was called he-man not random women saves the hero featuring he-man
Spoiler Alert: Woke SJW Trash
Beta-Heman has the power.
We’ll see how the nostalgic he-man fares with  2020 woke reception.
I remember when the original series was on. Man iam old
When one haircut says everything about a show.
No, god please no, return to the old plot and style He-man Skeletors voice was so good, and the old type of comedy. (Although I must say I do admire Mark Hamils voice)
He man and the woke of the universe
Oh boy, He Man goes woke. Well, there'll always be the Hentai versions of this...
Por favor Netflix não estraga essa série com pegação e bizarrice.
See? It's not so bad.
Im looking for a black he-man the woman progressive looking for a woman he-man and the LGBTQ+ looking he man to come ou the closet and  Skeletor doesn’t call somebody a “Punkass” or “Thot” I’ll be disappointed 😂
Finally - a cartoon that does't look like a steven universe anime knockoff.
we got the lesbian transgender chick no one ever ask for but we keep getting in everything now lol
Did I hear correctly?! Do we have the same voice actors as Samurai Jack and Aku back together again?! 😃
nah i wont be seeing this. bait and switch trash
Netflix please don't make this an inclusive cartoon don't ruin it for old people and everyone else
LIAR,   you know who you are and what you're doing.
I can’t wait to see the intro remastered
Teela takes the sword of power and becomes She-Mam...
by the power of Gayskull
Teela VS He man its so insane 🤩
Please note that She'Ra did not get this treatment.  Thanks.
So will there be a he-man series as well? Or just this teela one?
@Zack Snyder.....please revive it!!!
Besides Skeletor not feeling the voice acting but might be good
I wonder how they wokafied this..
anime he-man.  Ugh.
Ansioso
Tell'em Stevedave!
His transformation sequence kinda reminds me of Sailor Moon
I am a 90$ baby but I was not around when this show was on TV but I knew about it because of my older brothers. I am really happy to see this 😃
This feminist bs has ruined any good old show
It looks awesome I'll give it a chance
I wish he was voiced by Thor from Avengers Assemble...
Okay okay, who else here was way more impressed than they expected to be?
I've been hearing this is a Teela forward series. Basically He-man saying she'd make a better He-man. If this is true then thanks for ruining a classic Netflix.
Lena’s voice is ❤️🥰😍
He-Man
I love that they kept the blatant "Cartoon built around advertising a toy line" asthetic while still giving it a decent looking plot.
I... HAVE... TO SEE THIS!!!  (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
He man or He Karen ? Lol
So much yes!
Hope they dont slowly convert it to mistresses of the universe . Featuring She-Person
I need the classic intro
Aaaww shit, look at the haircut, this isnt going to end well
So they are using the original comic script, Nice
Guess I know how I'm spending my birthday now
I watch too much robot chicken.
T_T
Remember before woke culture and feminism when it was called 'he-man and the masters of the universe'..... ?
-Skeletor! Que haces carajo? -Que te pareceee, estoy intentando acabaaar con I-Vaaaan… Pero lrptm se fueeee! Dejá de mirarme como un trolasooo y vamos a buscairlooooo                                                  I-VAN!!
If u had He Man underwear in the 80s u were dripped out!
I was 37 years old before this trailer...now I am 4 again! Take me back to my childhood!  Already blown away
Dear @Netflix, please make also a remake of: Thundercats, Silver Hawks, G.I. Joe (animated series). Thanks!
Absolutely nobody: My brain: HEEEEEEYAAAAAHEEEEEYAAAAAAAHEEEEEEE
ameiiiii
Oh well, I guess in this day and age, we can already be happy He man didnt become Skeletors secret boyfriend....
What is this trash? She-ra reboot part 2?
1:08....so Kringer is no longer a cowardly scared cat? Gotta check this out!
Why is it all Teela? And why does she look like a man?
When will you learn that we can see the pandering y’all are doing ? ... no he-man ?? Is that how much y’all hate men ? 🤣🤣🤣 , also stop lesbianizing every character
The classic is still better, even the plot is better.
They just can't seem to hit 'I have the power!' like the original.. come on voice actors!
Oh no, Teela is a main character, like she always has been. I don’t understand the disappointment in the comments here lol
Did they straight up make He-man one of the villains...
They better not eliminate HE-MAN from the equation.  We are already tired of its "correction" the one who commands is the one who pays, not you, the boss is the client and the client wants things as is.
Better have  moss man
wow
Wish they did She-Ra like this too. Also they gotta do Brave Starr next.
Judging by Teela’s new hair cut, Netflix f****d it up already!
This has more action in the remake than the original when I was a kid….I can’t wait !!!
Public: We want a show with good character development and solid plot lines!!! NETFLIX: Best I can do you is gay.
Im gonna go back in time and swap out Kevin's shitty daughter with a boy who doesn't grow up to be a vegan SJW tardball. Then maybe him surviving that heart attack might not be one of the worst things to happen to pop culture in years. The Kevin Smith we all loved is dead and gone. Long live Vegan Kev, King of The Estrogen Ridden Nepotist Soyboys! May he live a thousand years.
Like “Mad Max Fury Road”, He-Man is a guest star on his own show. Thanks for lying to us Kevin Shill Smith.
-Colorado te doy media hora para que me soltes -Y yo te doy por el orto.
qué trolazoooooooo!
I will reserve judgment until it comes out but I’m already seeing and hearing things about this that smacks of SJW horsesh!t. Please, don’t ruin this too 🙏
Why do we need the angry lesbian for?
I can’t wait
Please don’t suck.. please don’t suck….     It’s gonna suck..   Bad….
Remember when we all thought this was going to be a He Man show? 😭
Where was Battle Cat?
They replaced He-Man with Teela so not really want I was hoping for. This is like replacing Buffy from Buffy The Vampire Slayer with Chuck Norris. Why just why?
This stuff is hella cringe and I love it "fOr EtErniAAAA!!!"
Back then I'm afraid this show will comeback as different name "She-Woman"  Well my fear become reality shit
Everything must have abs, even that rock over there must have a perfect set of abs and muscle. Or else
Where… is…. the… original theme music?
Hmm this seems a little sus but I'll give it a shot.
He man is copyrighted so they keep using Masters of the universe!?
He-Man has to be the main character, anything else, it wouldn't be Masters of the Universe...
Youtube comments sections are usualy a cesspool of incredible idiotic, ultra-reactionary comments, and well, this one here is no exception.
So is He-Man/Adam is a supporting character in this story?
There is shows that need to best left alone, especially all the 80s cartoons. They were fantastic and not to be rebooted.  Are new ideas dead.
another series destroyed by netflix and the woke
Is it the He-Man show? Or is it the Teela (Or whoever that one with the shaved head at a side was) one?
Wonder if there will ever have any connection to She-ra and the Princesses of Power? Probably or probably not?
Finally a remake that seems right. Was it that difficult to do the same for She-ra?
Finally..I'm in my 40's..took them long enough
It’s she man not he man now
Such great names, He man, Telah....er Evil... Lyn? ...nasty.... Brenda?
I love how all people in the comment section are whining about ”SJW” and the New Netflix show based on one of the Female lead characters in the story but i can’t find any of these so called SJW and Fans Of the New show, all i see is males upon males doing the Exact things that they critizice the others for.   Talk about being whiny Male hypocrite
a gente não queria uma série da Teela, A GENTE QUERIA UMA SÉRIE DO HE-MAN. Entenda isso, netflix
This looks like they/them-man lmao
Some of the designs are closer to the art in those companion comics that came with the 80s toys. Not sure I like Skeletor's clawed feet.
Looks good. ⚔ We will see.
Teela to He-Man: IN THE NAME OF TOXIC MASCULINITY. YOU HAVE NO POWER ANYMORE!
HE-MAN and masters of universe. Lacrations fails.
“HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN” - Skeletor
.... I HAVE THE POWER! ....

Fk yeah - I'm going to watch the hell out of this.
I was excited about this show, then I looked at the comments and now my excitement is gone. Oh well, that's just how people are these days.
*Skeletor's voice is Mark "I blackmail my son's girlfriend into abortion" Hamill, WoW* *I can't wait for Skeletor to insult a child because of his parents' political preferences.*
Is this Thunder Cats?
Teela gonna be rocking the "I want to speak to your manager" haircut.
We want hindi dubbed movie
Похоже Хи-мен не будет главным героем.
Part1 ? How boring
Pass, no interest in the Teela show, this is just She-Ra with better art.
Holly Shit!
This looks very good how ever wen he turn into He man it's not that good , the orignal 80's transformation is still the best
He-man was my mom's favorite cartoon. Gonna show her this
Now they need to do thunder cats
The first trailer got me hyped as an old fan. I've even got a scar through my eyebrow from when my friend smacked me with my own toy power sword lol but given the context of this trailer I think I'll pass. Doesnt look like it's for me. Hope everyone else gets what they want out of it 🖖
Nice to see the more adult style of animation coming back....unlike the god awful Thundercats reboot. Also, apparently 7K people who watched the trailer were expecting said Thundercats style animation and should be slapped into oblivion. This is why we can't have nice things.
Masters of Universe, Lesbolation sounds better Dude , this people are obsessed with lesbians
So Tela is some butch chick now huh? Ok...
Oh Boy, The Internet Men (tm) are going to throw a fit with this one just like they did with She-Ra, aren't they?
Looks better than "Endgame".
They made He-Man into a villain? Why? He might be strong as Superman but he acts like Captain America. Impossibly perfect and impossibly good. That's his one true caracteristic.
Why are people crying about if this show ends up being more Teela focused? He-Man the original show was mainly dedicated to him, along with all the other comics and media he was in. Why not let the other characters get some development and some love and make them all as badass and beloved as He-Man?
0:50 He-Man will die, confirmed. He went Fury spec.
Wait, where’s ORKO?
I really hope that Teela gets more attention, yes, but without stealing He-Man's protagonism.
disappointment!
Is that a race swapped King Grayskull on Adams right???
Nice one with using He man to attract audience,but trick them to watch bad blonde man and overpowerd shaven woman!lol
by the end of the Part 1... He - Man will be called "Sis - Man".
the balls on them to make a he man show and make he man an evil dude. and make teela the main character. im actually not surprised
Puta q pariuuuu bom d+
Well, guess I'll just keep rewatching the first trailer over and over and pretend this series never happened.
I really hope this is not going to be another one of those feminist crap. There's more Teela than He Man. Teela in 2002 was a bitch. This one looks way wosrse than that. Why don't these people just stick to the original idea for a change?
Netflix anime leveling up lately
Woke Garbage
Why do all Netflix cartoons look the same? Castlevania, Blood of Zeus, Yasuke, Trese, Pacific Rim, DOTA…
OMG, I'm GEEKING OUT !!! 😱😱😱 Sarah Michelle Gellar is TEELA !!! BUFFY is TEELA !!! 😵😵😵 I'm SO here for this !!! 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Man... I'm HYPED!
It better be good..this new version of my childhood favourite cartoon….
Teaser > Trailer ...
Guys, Adam always was super gay and Teela was always the smartass. I don't know what are you complaining about. You weren't paying attention in the 80s.
insert boring unneeded woke character . . . . . . . . . i hope this is good it looks like it could be but their are warning signs
Looks like fun
"Still know the tune?" And I say hey, yeah, yeah, yeah yay Hey, yay, yay I said hey, what's goin' on?
I hate what they did to Teela. Her design is horrible. If they sideline Adam and He-man like it seems they are and like the rumors said, I'm going to be so pissed off.
Why is He-Man not black? Have you forgotten yourself Netflix?
Nostalgia
If Skeletor doesnt say his famous lines, it will be such a disappointment.
Reminder that this is a bait-and-switch, He-Man dies/disapears/looses his power in first episode and Teela is the main character.
Looks a lot like 'Invincible,' but with a less-interesting storyline.
Awsome.... He- Man❤️❤️❤️
ugh ugly drawing
Waiting for Netflix Thundercats. That series has sooo much raw potential in this era!
You just know that Netflix will turn him into a GAF
Another bait and switch show by Kevin “I cry a lot “ smith
They should just name the series He-Man . They gonna get all the attention on 90s kid who watched the show. 😂😂😂😂😂
So He-Man shows up twice in the series? 😂
What's that "I have the power" all we Tamil people know it as "crystal khotaiyin shaktiyae"😂😂😂
He-Ma'am
The flashback stuff looks nice then teela changes from kick ass female warrior to androgynous star
The anime is very Japanese.
This is gonna be great, but you know what even more exciting? That this is Part 1.
should of had dolph lundgren voice he-man
I hope this new Netflix series will be better than the Netflix Voltron and She-Ra.
I can't wait until someone gets the scenes of this to make a remake of the heyayayayaya video
Himan is gay...
Remember friends this is a sequel to the 80s show. I recommend watching at least the first 5 episodes of that as that seems to be where the ideas this series is exploring come from
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Vao caga no desenho
I literally lost all interest in the show because of this trailer. Its clear what it actually is
More feminist bs from Netflix. That's hard pass for me.
Is this a continuation of He-Man? What origin story is it based out of, the classic He-Man or the earliest 2000s He-Man or the comic book He-Man?
Wicked
Me quedo con el original 😹
What they have done with it, they will loose majority of the core audience of He-man.
I been waiting for this. feels like dejavu of childhood, only 80's child can relate this
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside...
i missed the epic words of skeletor " next time HE- MAN"🤣
Ah yes, Netflix getting all woke as usual
It's Netflix y'all. Totally gonna be "Woke-Man & the Masters of Diversity!"
If rumors are correct and this is Tella lgbtq series, by by netflix forever
ich bin schwer Verliebt
GaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaY!. nope.
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, VAI SE DO CAAAAAAAARALHO!!!
ARE YOU A SELLOUT Kevin Smith!!??????
What is the distance between Eternia and Asgard?
Too bad mark hamill and Kevin smith are woke idiots lol … so long to the good ol days of American animation 👌🏼🇺🇸
Nostalgic...
Childhood memories flashing!!
I hope They-Person kicks butt!
Trash. Who is this female character and why?? Wow we really live in a feminist age
I have such high expectations for this.. Please don't disappoint !!!
Man My childhood fav comeback!!!
This looks so gooood🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪💪
Looks good maybe this will open the door for more reboots. Thunder Cats, G.I. joe just one request keep them in the original form.
Thanks for pressing the movie into 2 minutes. Saves a lot of time.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
is the only haircut for a badass woman?
Where the hell is "holding out for hero"?
I was fearful of a bait and switch.  I am now pretty confident that is the case.
This is totally different from classic
Nostalgia 😁😁😁
Why don't you call him He-man ? 🤔
I think sometimes the entertainment industry tries too hard to cater to the "woke" crowd but all I'm seeing here is awesomeness! The people bitching the most obviously know very little about the original.  I can't freakin wait to see this!
It doesn't have the original 🎶 music 🤬
U know what this means fresh skelator meme formats
I really hope this don't "gay" this up like they did to she-ra
He-man!!!!!!! Curiously waiting
Why does he mans face look so plastic surgery feminin like and the womans now like they had facial fusion with batista Wtf is this Only skeletor looks awesome, guess its to hard for sjw's to make a skeleton sjw friendly
He/Him and the Masters of Correctness
Whaaaaaaaat? Cinger can talk?
Kevin Smith was all “It’s nice to give an audience what they ask for, for a change.”
He man is so gheeey
Looks like it's going to be the ol' bait-and-switch.  1-1.5 episodes of He-Man, now it's the Teela leading the way.  No thanks.  Sad too since the animation looks great.  I've gotten to the point where I cringe when I see them try to reintroduce a franchise I enjoyed; they should just stop until these cookie-cutter woke-isms are done with.
Woah, he is white and not gay!!!! This is new!
0/10, didn't use an updated version of the original theme. xD
He is back and the meme continues and I say HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA!
Kevin smith is not a fan
Hell yeah I can't wait. he-man is the shit and it looks like they did a really good job. But only time will tell
Hey ware is the green tiger😭😭😭
Looks like they disabled the counter on the dislikes...hmm i wonder why?
That line "I have the POWER" Lit AF💖😎✨🤘
He Man wieviel Power willst du ...  Ja...
I hate political correctness and SJWs, but I'm still quite optimistic about this. It looks like this is set in 2 different timelines, the classic one and a second dystopic one where all the characters look different and more hardened (something similar to Shrek 4). Teela is just one of these, she does have a lot of screen time but she used to be one of the main characters even in the classic cartoon (together with Duncan and Orko).
Indians are want in Hindi Please dub this series
No He-Man in tris serie…. Is Tela and the master of the universe…☹️
Still miss that old cult classic He Man opening theme
I can't imagine what life must be like to be a fully grown man who gets upset because a short trailer for a reboot of a children's cartoon originally made in the 1980s happens to prominently feature a female character.  What's it like, guys? Is it as pathetic as I imagine it must be?
The animation looks BEAUTIFUL. Can't wait for some He-man action scenes!
So y’all bringing the OG shows to Netflix too, right? RIGHT?!
Too much teela
Another part of my childhood gets woke, thanks Netflix for giving me an excuse to go outside instead of watching series.  Also Kevin Smith lying and blaming the fans? No bueno, and for the ppl who thinks this Is ok, pls sit on this one ".I." and Start pedaling.
Main villain is the boss of Hordak, consuming the magic well of Eternia. Done. FU Kevin Smith, get spoiled.
SHE-MAN
Русский заинтересованный комментарий😘
Lame!!! You fucks ruin everything
Cant wait!!!!
dear netflix, please add classic soundtrack
Looks like crap
23 Juli wird für mich zum Nationalfeiertag. Ich liebe es einfach. Das ich das noch mal erleben darf. Danke an den Machern.
Reminded me of my childhood ❤️
this honestly looks stupid lol
He Man on Netflix. Alright...😁😁😁
This looks wack af
Every man wants a magic sword.
Please Please please just don't suck
Trailer did its job. Now looking forward to this show. I wasn’t the biggest He Man fan as a kid but I’m looking forward to watching this with my boys.
I have a very bad feeling about this...
We need another skelator wat
Oooh the new trailer for Teela: Mistress of the Universe has dropped.
Thank You Netflix for bringing alive my childhood again 🤘😎
Reminding me of my childhood the tunes "I have the power" brought tears to my eyes. I am now so excited to watch He-Man with my son!
Why Teela looks like a man? If its Netflix then she is probably lesbian
1:11 is that He-Man's toxic masculinity.  Teela better femsplain to him why red eyes are a sign of patriarchy.
Sorry He-Man, but no, you don´t have the power 😥. Why? Because Netflix.
Teela and the Masters of the Universe (also featuring HeMan)
So this show is about SHE-MAN and the man hating woke lesbians?
I wonder if skeletor will get another origin story
I knew something was off when He-Man's name wasn't on the title.  Another property ruined by cucks
I will try to remember you fondly, 90's Kevin Smith. This skinny imposter is a talentless traitor.
the f@cked mark hamil again.
Despite all the negativity some are giving this, I'm still interested in watching this. This trailer is okay, hard to get excited because the first had the "I need a hero" song, which makes alot of things better, but I hope the series is good.
I just want to hear adam saying By the power of grayskull, lightning strikes turns in to he man and in heavy voice I have the poweeeeeer
Where the F@*k is Shera ?!
So I want to address the criticism of this show and I understand that we are likely overexaggerating our fears based on a few minutes of a trailer. I grew up a fan of the series, collected the toys and the mini comics. Despite being a fan of the original Teela I am sure some will accuse me of being a misogynist just for questioning the shows potential direction with the character. In this push to replace a male character it seems they overly masculinized the character or so it seems like a tell tale sign. We could be completely wrong and I hope we are and i'm willing to give this series a chance but I wanted to address the elephant in the room. Personally I am not entirely upset with the redesign but I understand how others could be or assume the worst. There seems to be this push for strong female representation which is good but it seems to come at a cost and when questioned by men and young boys they are immediately accused of sexism and misogyny. The fear that our male role models being taken away from us as if toxic or needed to be replaced by someone female. The irony is the equality and respect for women was already there. The issue exists not only in this cartoon but other fandoms as well ie. Thor being replaced by female Thor and I think this is what has some male fan's upset. We are allowed to cheer the Heroine and not the Hero. What does that say about a young boys confidence? Where ok with Girl power but not Boy power? The second issue is for those who expose feminist ideology don't seem to be keen on promoting femininity and beauty. The original Teela was able to retain those qualities.
Ah okay. So you guys tried to bait me. I'm guessing we saw 90% of the He-Man and Skeletor action scenes in the "I Need a Hero" scene.
This is amazing!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Not releasing this in time for Pride month was a big let down
He-man
Let's admit it anime looks better than american animation. Reminds me of those animated DC movies. Stiff movement with clunky jagged characters.
THE 80'S SPANISH DUBBED CAST ALWAYS be the best voice team characters EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm cautiously curious and optimistic so far. Considering the show's title is "Masters of the Universe", I could totally imagine the main protagonist switching from episode to episode. I wouldn't expect them avoiding "He-Man" just to make him into a side character.
Will it become another show ruined by the ridiculous woke culture?
Oh ffs stop making stuff female orientated,
*yawns*
Looks like He-Man isn't the main character anymore. Hard pass
Am glad he man's back but I hope it hasn't gone woke from what I've herd
Thank you Netflix for at lest being honest about the show in the description..   "After a calamitous battle fractures Eternia, Teela and an unlikely alliance must prevent the end of the Universe in this sequel to the ’80s classic."
Looking more and more like He-Masculated.    He-Man loses his power and the majority of the show is Teela and Prince Adam questing to get it back with Adam being a comedic wuss and Teela being the hero.
E d'un tratto torno bambino
What is this?  Netflix not completely changing a main character on a remake? Can't wait to pirate this!!!! Yeah, you guys still have "Cuties" so fck you, I'm not subscribing.
Have to be honest this trailer took the wind out of my sails, The first Trailer I’m not ashamed to say made me cry, now i have been a fan For over 35 years,I’m an old man, but I sure as hell still buy a lot of merchandise from this brand,but this trailer is so Teela Centric,It seems to validate what clown fish TV said, this is also the concerns of many other fans, I’m hoping that this is all a miss direction and not a bait and switch.  If Star Wars and comic book fans are rabid, Kevin hasn’t seen anything yet,I really hope this is 150% successful, I really, really do,It’s quite simple really all you have to do is update but don’t change, I’ve already seen some changes that has my head Scratching but I am cautiously optimistic
Fragile masculinity all over the place in the comments. This is a show for people that can live with changes. Yes, Teela will have a bigger role. What's the problem with that? He-Man will still get his instant crossfit body. But a powerfull man can't need the help of a woman...
Ah man.. Cringer sounded like he had a normal human person voice.. that's not good. Everything else looks like a nice reboot of the 2000's MOTU.
Let me guess. Women Power above all else. Right??!!
if we dont get at least one she ra (2018) reference I'm gonna cry
Sure seems like it is more about Teela
I wonder how many memes are gonna come out of this show
When skeletor started speaking... the only thing that came to mind was Skips
Yep....gonna be as expected....the teela show
bring that ass here, my beast master wants a peek
My pronouns are “He-Man”
Have not been more excited to see this since the first teaser dropped. I’m not sure why people are already hating it even though no one else has seen an episode. I mean if it’s bad when it comes out then it’s is what it is but at least watch at least 1 before declaring it a dud. I keep on thinking about the karate kid, they tried to redo it almost frame by frame with the Jaden smith version and it did not really do anything different so that was really a waste and when cobra Kai was created, that universe expanded to places I’ve never even imagined they can take it to where it is now. What I just wanted to say is that at least be open to where they can take this wherever they take it. You’ll never know , you might even like it even if the story goes to where you don’t want it to go
jebaited
HEEEEE MAANN!!!👍🏽👍🏽🤙🏽
Class
LOL this is gonna suck.
He-Man is voiced by Elliot Page...
Getting ghost busters fibes and I dont like it
It’s going the woke way. Well Kevin it seems your out of ideas and just a puppet for a pay check. I would love him to come out and defend the changes as his ideas alone and take the hit like a man. Only hit he will be getting from now until he totally disappears from entertainment.
Shame shame !
0:37 When your arms are bigger than your head, you know you went overboard in the gym. I think this is where kids get distorted ideas of a good male physique from. This and Instagram. XD
They should have just made She-Ra.
He-Man comes out as trans.
So I guess the whole Teela getting her own sword of power is true.  I will reserve judgment until I see the whole series  , however , female version of He-man (most powerful man in the  universe) is suppose to be his twin sister She-Ra " the Princess of Power".  Temporarily splitting the power sword  could just be a plot device used in the story to help He-man/ prince Adam grows as a hero.
Teela looks like a bloody man in this. What the hell? I have a bad feeling about this.
The amount of whining men in these comments should surprise me but, sadly, it doesn’t.
This looks great! One of the things alot of people are forgetting is the old series was called "He-man and the Masters of the Universe"....this is just The Masters Of The Universe...it's being told from a focus that ISN'T He-man and Teela would have taken over when Man-at-arms left (assuming he's left I haven't seen him yet)
Asthigoodaaaa.. Malayalies like adi
Wokeflix
Oh!!! My favourite.... ❤️❤️❤️
I'm not going to judge the whole show based on only 2 trailers but yeah... It really looks like He-Man will appear only at the end of the show. There's barely any new scenes with him in this new trailer.
Looks ok. I hope the actual show doesn’t have cuts that fast.
Why does Teela look like a man?   If you want to empower WOMEN why not make them feminine?  Maybe the twist is that Teela is He-man.
Teela and her girlfriend will have the spotlight and the show will be she-ra all over again. Man, can't we have just one thing that's not all LGBT, that's not how it was in the 80's
Suddenly all, above 40 year old, kids are here to catch a glimpse of their Hero.
Wait what.. !! Battle cat can speak!!! Nobody is going talk about battle cats speaking ability...
Thank you Kevin Smith👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Mark Hamill is a national treasure so many iconic roles. He just knocks it out the park with everything he’s does what a Legend. 💯
Sadly  it looks like a series about Teela with He Man as her side kick….
So this is Teela heavy..  ok, its a shame Netflix doesn't have the original He-Man show, as I didn't know that Teela was unaware Adam was He-Man.
Well, I WAS interested in this.  I'm hoping that this is just a poorly done trailer and Kevin didn't Kevin Smith this show.
Teela is the maincharakter!? No more He-man and the masters of the universe! Only masters of the universe!! I hate this woke Mainstreambullshit!! Lesboteela saves the World! 🤮🤣🤣🤣
Seems like they are making Teala more of a character than they ever did before, because, I guess even He-Man gets nagged about equality.  I hope they don't ruin the show worrying about that.
She ra crossover
10 YEARS TO LATE
I HAVE THE POWER!!!
Ok I’m totally fine with everyone disbanding and Teela bringing them back together because it’s not a bad story, but if there are heavy handed agendas littered in it, then I’ll be super disappointed ☹️
not cool 🥱
If theres a heyayeyayaaeye refarence then we're good
First two episodes will featur hints of heman, the rest is teela discovering the magic and becoming the he woman. Heman will turn evil because reasons n stuff. Abandon all hope my fellow friends that this will be anything else.
When the new clip of Trollhunters??????????????
Teela is ugly…
New trailer makes it look like the leaks are true. Well, that's that I guess. Thanks for lying kevin smith
She man
|:[ wat?
Anyone expecting real-life movie
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and get real high and I scream at the top of my lungs WHATS GOING ON???????? And I said HEYYYYEAYEAYEAYEAH
No more he-man ?
Now do Thunder Cats
The music playing when Adam transforms honestly sounds so damn good. 1:55
where is the Chinese character ? the muslim hijab women character? the trans character ...!?
Vera level ❤️❤️❤️💯👌
Nah. Without 83s legendary theme, it doesn't give me the same goosebumps.
I believe the vaccine is the mark of the beast
Boycott it
Why is everyone already hating on this show from a 2 and a half minute trailer?   If it was me I would actually wait until we can watch the show to freak out about it.
I'm worried whether this will be Masters of the Universe feat. He-Man.
Damn I hope He-Man is the main character. I'd rather him fight alone with his cat as usual but have some reoccurring side characters.
I'm really disappointed, and it's just a trailer.....sheesh!
Where is that little magic guy ORCO or something
honestly, it gave me chills
WHAT'S GOING ON?
That realization that Robot Chicken has been a more faithful adaptation to all of your childhood then all of the official content.
I haven't seen He-Man since the 1980s. This looks really good.  I can't wait to see this.
Man this trailer just zapped out all of the energy that the first trailer had and honestly I was hoping for a better plot
So what I get from this is that Tela is going to lead the quest to find power swords Adam become He-Man again period which will probably take up the whole season. And then we'll get He-Man  in one or two episodes at the end.
SERIE LACRAÇÃO NAO VAI TER HE MAN COMO PRINCIPAL !
yeah it was to good to be true...they had to squeeze in one of those...
Netflix WAS the leading streaming service
I want to cancel my subscription.  But my family use my account.
2nd season of The Dark Crystal!  Come on, guys. Sort it out
The old graphics and animation was the best
He-Man > Teela ...If this is all about Teela than I'm out!
this time Netflix, take my money
My childwood hero 'he man'
That butch haircut on Teela should tell you something...
WHAT?! No one is race swaped?? I'm shocked.
Can thunder cats be next plzzzzz
am I the only one looking forward on Thundercat remake?
Omg I know I used to watch this when I was 5 years old I don't remember to much about it  but I know it was good
Well political correctness caught up with he-man too.........
ഗ്രേസ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നുള്ളിൽ  ഒതുങ്ങുമാ ശക്തി കുടി വാ  Athoke oru kalam
Finally
The other trailer made this look really good. This one looks like utter tosh. Sadly everyone seems to be right, Kevin Smith ruined He-Man! What a waste, I really hope I'm wrong but this looks crap.
Looks gay ass hell, saw no women closes thing to it was Adam, this show is going to be a sausage fest
Who cares?
Cannot compare with the old he-man series... Not a bit....  Remember how he use to roar "By the power of greyskull.... I have the power"......
I really appreciate how it kinda ties with the She-ra reboot with the magic being gone. It would be cool if they teamed up in the end in a way that, like how in the original series(plural), the second sword was for Adora, since it has been split in half now. I hope this inspires people to make full scale replicas.
That's just not acceptable! The titel has to be named Mistress of the Universe. And please, make it in rainbow colors, because it looks kinda toxic.
I’ll watch this. For the animation. Ok I’ll keep an open mind and watch it for what it is. Make it dark that’ll be good.
Doesn't even say He Man
Plot twist; He-Man is Gay and She-Ra is a transgender!.
Man, who bought all these false likes on the video? Must have been expensive.
Please don't woke this shit up!
Oh look , the new she-man show
Yeah. This is what the fans have been waiting for. Another Alpha male destroyed. (And I LOVE strong female characters. I think the Teela thing could be great (minus the girlfriend. It’s not cannon. ). But why dose a strong female character have to come at the cost a male one. Call it Teela. Give girls a character (that falls into cannon OR just create something new. ) What wrong with creating a NEW cartoon. Why bastardize an original IP. I think that’s why I am so pissed. They can’t create their own characters, can’t write their own stories, aren’t creative enough to create their own universe AND they aren’t talented enough to form their own fan base SO they bastardize existing IP’s and pretend they’ve done the hard creative work. They’ve done NO work. They’ve high hacked an IP. Repackaged it. And slapped it on Netflix. (My 2 cents. And I’m cool with it if I get beat up out here. …… It’s expected. )
I detect a "female empowerment, strong white men bad" vibe in this.  I'd better be mistaken.
He-man was ahead of his time. He was the first person to use pronouns in his name. You’d think he would get to be the lead in his own show 😂😂😂
What a load of turd the old ones better
I hate this comment section
Teela and adam will be a “duo” — she will have a strong AF presence and he will be a weak, emotional, spoiled, and pathetic. They will travel across Eternia for magic and Teela will train him. Only when he turns into he-man is Adam actually her “equal.” The show won’t be about her, it will be about their “partnership” — a “non-toxic” friendship to show boys how to act around strong women. Heman will have substantially less on screen time than Teela and Adam. Weak Adam will be the default position of “maleness” in this series. The “Revelation” is that women are as strong as men, and there’s a pseudo prophecy or riddle that states that one of the swords needs to owned by a woman for magic to exist in the universe. Teela will get one of the swords of power and that will be the only way Eternia is saved. One magic sword given to each gender — “equality.”  In today’s woke culture, this is the only version of Heman you’ll get.
Is that Lena Headey’s voice?
🙄
Well they choosed not to call the series He-Man for a reason.
To all the fools crying he man is getting replaced, well news flash, the edge lady teela was next to adam when he transforms. So no replacement.
I have the STEROIDS!!!!!
My very first childhood hero
Kochu tv show He-Man alee ??
ഗ്രേസ്‌കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി🔥🔥😸😼
Super g@y
Is that Buffy?😍
Amazing
100% cgi garbage.
I am a lady and I say that Teela had better not be the protagonist. Teela "putting together an alliance" gave me remake She-Ra vibes and it ISN"T a good thing.
Little bit worried that this is going to be the tila show
wait what? I just watch the he man documentary and now this? awesome!
How about making your OWN stories and let all your friends watch that and stop screwing with true writers and storylines Netflix?!! Let's boycott this into oblivion fellas. These folks only understand money.. Proctor & Gamble.. You're next!!
Skeletor voiced by Mark Hamil?
There's no kick in " I have the Power"! It must be the same as the original!
If this has gone woke like many have said, this will be trash
Sem palavras 😍
Please not another anime
Teela rocking that mental illness haircut and resting wahmen bitch face.
hmm on first look idk..... it seems they are doing some bad things and i dont like it!!! Man this show is about He-man! Wth did i watch just now?!?!?!?! Hope hes not a side character!
Wow
Boomers and straight white guys are crying because Teela, a strong female character is going to play a bigger part. We are not in the 80s anymore so get used to this, MOFOs
What some people don't seem to get is that if you want a thrilling story arc with a certain desirable end, you have to begin your story telling at the opposite end. He-Man being the strongest from the beginning - no stakes! They have to take/limit his power somehow, in order to get it back to him later. Looking forward to see more Adam then. I always felt bad for him as a kid, when his father and Teela treated him as a coward. And now Teela finding out? His father too??? There is some gold character development in that. And I can also very much relate to Teela being pissed - her role as Adams protector must feel like a cruel joke to her afterwards. Not to mention, her parents not telling her anything ... To me all this sounds VERY promising and I can't wait to see it!
The fact that people have already decided that this is going to be "woke trash" just because a woman is a main character alongside He-Man just proves how insufferable these internet reactionaries are...  you lot were saying this about She-Ra and that turned out to be good... you get outraged more than the SJWs you complain about daily. Stop watching The Quartering and Geeks and Gamers and go outside lmao  Life is actually pretty cool and fun when you stop being cynical. Try it, it's great
This looks awesome!
Netflix wants STRONG FEMALE LEEEEEEEADS! Disgraceful.
Cap soulja planet was the first to ever be a planet
He-man has always been garbage. Man boys need to grow up and get over their fixation with purity.
So Cristiano Ronaldo isn't playing He-Man anymore ? xD
the animations look terrific. I only fear that they make not "transformed" He-Man to a feminin manlet, which he wasn't on the old series. He was always buffed as hell
Wow!! That's like reliving my childhood. How much we used to wait to watch He-man on TV 🤩
Everything we've ever loved is turning woke. What is the root cause of this I wonder.
And I say HEYEAYEAYEAHEYEAYEAYEA, I say hey, what's going on
What the f*** is this? 🤮
Why did the red-head have to be muscular and manly? Why can't she be feminine and sleek and still be powerful?
Wait a minute .. what happened to the original tune .. please bring it back .. without it our 90's childhood is incomplete..
wtfk i have the power lol
i saw balmond
Honest? Or misleading?
Flash Gordon Saviour of the Universe!!!
Kookad pakake khavo zyda maza aata hai is cartoon se
We all know He-Man is gonna be sidelined when the show is titled "masters of the universe revelation" Another good series ruined by Netflix adapting it.
chills. literal chills
If mark hamill’s Skeletor doesn’t call somebody a “boob” or “nincampoop” I’ll be disappointed 😂
teela wearing pants it sucks
they HEYAYAYAYA guy is back
Hindi m bhi ayegi kya
Hopefully they don't try to change the the homoerotic undertones.
I love heman remember my childhood memories
Waiting!!!!!!!
Nice that Prince Adam finally looks way different than He-man
Congratulations to netflix on another feminist pc  garbage
What happened to "by the power of Grayskull"
Greyskull kottaiyin sakthi 🗡️⚡⚡⚡...then vari Puli soora Puli ah change aagum 😂🤣
히맨 !!!!!!!
enemies to lovers 👀
He Man should have been the main character
Where is the He Man track?
Wokeflix can jam it , i have the original so i'll think i'll pass.
" By the power of Grayskull, I have the powerrrrrrr!"
Opening narrator: Cersei Lannister - Lena hedley????
"Being a hero, swallows your hole..."  _WTF_
Person: Hey isn't that He-M-* Netflix: *We don't say that word here.* Person: What? But that's clearly He-M* Netflix: *WE DON'T say that word.* Person: But....Its He-Man and the Masters of the Universe? Netflix: Yes Masters of the Universe.  Person: Sooooooo you gonna edit She-Ra's title or what now? You know, to make it fair and equal? *Netflix takes out gun and shoots persons' pet cat in the head.*
The series will be all about teela... That's not a surprise..........
The pussified version of Heman, this is not Heman. Don't reboot something if you can't get it properly just to appease.
The unfortunate truth is that DC MOTU will be unbeatable...
wowwww our childhood memories is back with the hero.....'heman'...thnx netflix
I hope this time they finished it
So disappointing. 😔
MOTU: Teela will play a bigger role from now on! Internet: It's all about Teela! MOTU: No, but she...  Internet: This is so progressive! MOTU: Oh boy... Internet: Did you just assume my gender?!
Ich glaub das wird episch!
Calling it now: it's gonna suck.
Sick!
2 minute trailer has 30ish seconds of Teela... It's somehow enough for Chuds everywhere to lose their minds 🤣😂
A Netflix original series She-Man this is going to be canceled before the 1st season finishes guarantee it .
Bei der Macht von Grayskull!!!
This takes me back. Hope they don't mess this up
Noice ❤️
Tela the bestest eveerr 😧
The design of the Sword is changed at the hand guard and the handle area 😕🤔
He-man gets this and we get Thundercats Roar! Sigh
Damn. Now I really feel lame for never watching the original 😔
❤️🔥
They need to remake Jake and the MAchines silver hawk
"Teela and The Masters of the Universe. " Just admit it, Kevin.   I'll still watch, just be honest 😂  Now, if it's something like Sypha and Trevor from Castlevania, that's would be fine.
And the latest contender in the woke Olympics is….
Man can't wait for this hope it's not only ten episodes for the first season
Hey Netflix release this series in tamil also
Finaly
Dang this looks dope.
VF series is for gays
Gays of The universe
This Looks shit il just keep watching the 80s version
Is it just me that found his “I have the power” slightly underwhelming in it’s delivery?
He-man 2002 was better than it.
Looks like Tee-la and Evil Lyn will team up to defeat Skeletor and rescue He-man. Yawn.
Now we are waiting for COSMOCATS 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😭
I hope that He-Man gets oiled up and wrestles around with Skeletor's bone, just so I can hear the rain of terrified tears. I thought Jesus was supposed to be your ideal man? Is Jesus too socialist for you?
The writing is cringe but the animation looks decent
If this is popular they'll make a live action movie
Dude i’m crying, this is so good
Netflix y’all the man love y’all bringing these show’s back
Shitty graphics for 2021.
My childhood hero He-man🔥🔥🔥
omg, OMG!
Ooohhhhh looks good
ഹി മാൻ 🔥 അസ്ഥിക്കുടം 🔥
They took the gay out of He-man
Thanks for reminding my childhood back again..
So I know Prince Adam was not buff or anything, but now compared with Tela he became more of a woman and she more of a man. Is this symbolism or something?
Childhood nostalgia
I AM THE POWER!!!! MILLENNIALS THIS IS OUR ANIME
please not another mary sue
He man 😍
I am sensing some “woke” in this. I hope not…..
John Michael Vincent is stronger than He-Man
So is this a continuation of the classic series because I’ve never seen it. I saw the reboot when I was little
I HAVE THE SOY!
So it's not really about he man, the guy running the show lied, and y'all really just click baited us thanks guess I'll watch of he-man again
Daddy AF!😊😍
Teela: still know the tune? Me: some things, you can never forget. Me again: Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
So He-Man is a side kick to teela 🙄
Wow...no classic music at all.  A missed opportunity.
Yes people want Teela as the main character.  Teela...   I cannot wait until we can put this era in movies and T.V. well behind us.
I don't know why people complain in this trailer. Sure, He-Man isn't featured as much as Teela, who takes a more important role in the story, but there is still plenty of respect given to the character. The first trailer paid enough homage to He-Man as well, so we can bear to have something a bit more focused on Teela for the second trailer. If they complain about the focus on Adam, they have to remember that He-Man is basically Adam, but just with more muscles and a boost in confidence thanks to his newfound strength. Adam is a good boy who prefers peace to war and always put the safety of the people above his own, so is He-Man. As for Teela becoming less feminine, there is always worse and I am too used to Ripley and Sarah Connor becoming "manlier" during times of crisis to complain.
He Man is back mofos 🤘🤘🤘
its weird seeing this style of animation without blood and guts everywhere
This does look awseome, however in the comics why did he have blue eyes but in the cartoon have brown?? lol
Everybody after the first trailer: I HAVE THE POWER!! <3 They have finally done justice to He-man without fucking it up!  Netflix: Hold my beer...
Okay, I feel like this needs to be said, but while I still have some hope this show is gonna be pretty good  There's not a lot of hope for it, left  My main complaint is mainly with Teela and I know everyone will say too, "stfu you sexist loser" , but I have no problem with her as the main character, who knows, this show could be insane and she could be one of the best written characters ever, but she needs to be clearly established as THE MAIN CHARACTER   The last trailer (The Trailer that more people saw) was basically showing off He-man. Every "cool" scene in the trailer was from either a shot of him doing something cool and or him delivering a one liner or something of the sorts   If I remember correctly, Teela was shown like three times, first for like 2 seconds running towards something, second when she used a sword on an enemy and finally when He-man throws her, which you could barely even recognize her with the motion blur  Continuing on this tangent, whenever a show or a movie decides to abandon the established main character in favor of telling the story from the point of view of a side character, it's usually always a downgrade since you can almost never live up to the originals and I'm not saying this trope is always bad, but it has a bad track record   If she's the main character, then don't try to hide it, show how cool she can be and how much of interesting character she can be, but they don't for two potential reason's   Either the people who made the trailer don't have confidence people will watch the show without showing He-Man or they don't have confidence in Teela as a character to actually be proud enough to show her more in the trailers and both of these are bad and will leave feeling  fans betrayed or lied too  I know for a fact, if He-man is thrown to the side as a side character or supporting character   They will turn on this show fast  All my hopes go to the creators of this show, you guys might have some negative shit coming your way, but I will hold out some hope that this show will be at least somewhat faithful to the old cartoons
Finally a He Man show about Tee La. I remember watching He Man as a kid thinking, “He Man sucks.  I wish Tee La would get a butch haircut and become Eternia’s true champion, defeating toxic masculinity and white male privilege with her woman power.”  Kevin Smith must have read my mind.
anyone else starting getting bored with the same art in every cartoon in netflix??
He is back 💣💥
In malayalam, le he-man.. Graiskal kottayudey shakti enn ullil othunguma sakti koodi vaa... 😂😂😂
cheap anime？
Que não haja o empoderamento feminino!
EPIIIIIIC!!!
We know who the star of this show will be. Just check for the typical hair style.
You had one job!
Now that's the 90's kids real anime on Netflix ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
F#@$$ing liers...
Adam's pet cat (cringer) is talking in this just like in the original version. Well makes up from the 2002 reboot.
I said hey, what's going on
Amaziiiiiiing!!!!!!!!
SHE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE WOKE UNIVERSE!
This trailer looks awesome. The comments are poison.
I hope there will be FISTO as well cause with his iconic Village People look has been probably a dream for many young gay guys back then. Obviously IMHO and with all due respect 👌
Skeletor ___ the lord of destruction   Beerus __   ahmm ahmm
Netlfix is playing with my nostolgia here, they better not ruin it.
Why doesn't he have the cross on his chest armor?
🔥
If the main story isn't centered around He-Man and Skeletor I don't know what to tell ya
Soo she woman?
By the power of woke I am toxic masculinity and we are all hezhe
This is HeMan in a new package! Nice.
Is it from the same studio as The Legend of Korra? Looks similar
I have the power.... where is the damn growl? and that background "he man." and voice of skeleton is shit, where is that nasal creepy voice and laugh. I think all netflix are born after 2000. Nostalgia killer.
I had a lot of these toys as a kid, this is exciting.🤩
Let He man be a He man in his movie , shela can have her day anyday but not on He man day.
Teela is gunna be she-man, the transter of eternity
is that lena headey's voice...
By the power of Gray skull...😍
Swat cats thunder cats revive em all Netflix make cartoon great again
I have the power
Thalaiva😭😭(( தலைவா )))
Is it too much to ask them to respect the original story?
Uh-oh!
Has anyone not noticed that Fisto is whatever the dark-skinned people of eternia are now? I've watched this three times and I just caught it when they are all charging with teela
Ich bin 47 und werde mir das trotzdem wieder anschauen.Bei der Macht von Castle Greyskull (-:
Beast man fights side on side with the good guys?
That’s not HE-MAN, that’s SHE-MAN 🧐
"I built a life of Truth, away from magic" well that's a not so subtle hidden attack. And besides that, was she trying to say she didn't believe magic was real?
💨
The original He Man was obviously gay, i hope they explore this deeper within the series.
I like femboys as much as the next guy, but this Teela ain't doing it for me, bruh.
Ñasssss
without his theme music!
“By the power of Grayskull… I have the power!”  it has to say...
Hmmmm....mmmmhhhmmmmm........ yeah........   I'm gonna wait till it's plot is released in full. I mistrust this deeply. It feels like I'm being honey-dicked into watching trash.
Can we left the undercut hairstyle in 2019? its really out of style at this day and age
I really wish He-Man to be gay in this series just to see homophobic bozzos getting furious.
He-Man is the first superhero in my childhood ....... You stupid Netflix better not screup........
Watching this and a voice in my head keeps saying “ im sure somebody’s going to be gay “
what a manly women
I have the Powerrrrr !!! He man childhood memories
WAS JUST WAITING FOR HIM TO ROAR " I HAVE THE POWER" SO SO SO EXCITED..... HE-MAN YESS YESS YESS...  DON'T MAKE HIM DIE. AND IF YOU CAN MAKE THAT VOICE DEEPER...
God loves you and died for you turn to him before is to late say his word if you want Amen
Yup, Kevin is lying. This  show is going to  about Tela. He-man will not be the main focus of the show. I hope I am wrong but It seems pretty clear in this story trailer. Kevin said this would clear things up and perhaps it has.
The title should be He Man not some low budget game name.
Teela: has rad hair   Teela after taking off the mask: has generic modern half shaved head.    Oh, ok... c o o l....
The first trailer gave me goosebumps...this one, gave me severe disappointment 🤣🤣
Heman- gracekal kottaiyin sakthiye 🔥🔥🔥
Bring back the He-Man intro score...
lol all the incels are out in force here
My childhood comes back ♥️
Grey skull kotayin  sakthiyae ennul  irrukum sakthiyaeeeè💥
The voice of Cersei ! God I love Lena Headey.
He-Man... After such a long time... Childhood hero
damn Netflix is a disappointment
Mark hamill as skeletor, basically feels like if Joker died, and was reincarnated as a lich in an alternate universe.
Is this in any way connected to She-Ra? The recent She-Ra series on Netflix? I know that the art style and animation are very different but is there a chance the two are still connected?
Ok... IM EXCITED. SKEPTICAL but EXCITED.
She-Man...
Meu cabelo é igual ao do he-,man
They actually did it,woke heman universe 😂,Let me guess the plot: heman goes badguy and teela save the day and saves heman while at it....
Wanted to see some more of Battle Cat
He-Man: "I HAVE THE POWER!!" Skeletor: "I just Sh*t myself!!"
To be honest, I have no idea about He-Man, the universe, the races or the lore.
"After a calamitous battle fractures Eternia, Teela and an unlikely alliance must prevent the end of the Universe in this sequel to the ’80s classic."
When I was a kid, He man had an iron Cross in his chest bands.  Now it's a fancy H.
"Some things you can never forget"
I’m wondering whether He-Man’s sword was split into 2……….. as far as I know that was skeletor’s sword
Communist  Netflix ruined 😠 he-man
They turned Teela to a butch
Return of 90's ......ppl born in 80,s  are just awesome they had fewer super hero's to follow and without much of confusion and more to that every comic just made sense...not like these days where everything is just too confusing...even bad characters turn into hero's in their own series creating villain within a villain.........way to goo...hope Netflix doesn't f$%#^k this series up. WE HAVE THE POWER........
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish a big Apology
One more show down the tubes.
Grew up watching the original series. Now with this one, let's hope they keep politics out of it.
is the sequel to the 1983 or 2002 animated series?
Why the hate? You have not even seen a single episode! You do not know how good or bad the show will be! Just to hate a show because one character is not in the permanent spotlight is not only narrow-minded by also stupid.
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANO!!!!!ARREPIEI!!!!!
Maybe it's is better to change 'Jake and Silent Bob' into 'Jake and Woke Bob'.
Animation is not up to the mark
Was so saddened to see that they ruined Teela.  80s Teela was feminine, beautiful and a very capable captain of the guards.  Here in Revelation she looks like a dude.  Why do strong women have to be made to look like dudes in shows nowadays? Netflix is especially guilty of this.  A woman can be strong and feminine at the same time, they just don't get it.  They better not do a bait and switch with Teela sidelining He-Man or I'm cancelling my Netflix subscription.
കൊച്ചു TV ല് കണ്ടോടിരിന്ന ഹിമൻ അല്ലേ അത്🙄🤯
According to this trailer, it looks like HE-MAN is taking a back seat to TEELA who is now a "stronk whaamens" and whatever 🙄🤦‍♂️😒 !   TEELA was never one of my favorite MOTU characters, BUT... after seeing how she threw her tiara down on the ground with impudence before getting that stupid haircut & ugly expression on her face... I absolutely HATE this character now more than ever 😡 ! THIS version, anyways !
Lemme guess I’m gonna scroll down and it’s going to be a bunch of buthurt snowflakes bitching about wokeism or whatever made up not actually a problem nonsense to give them an excuse to bitch about women.  Wasn’t entirely wrong.
*looks down at all the silly comments accusing it of being an excuse to shovel in homosexuals*  Oh yes because NOTHING about He-man was EVER interpreted as GAY before!
What do you think about this trailer guys? Are you guys interested? Cause I am not. 😑
Can't wait!
Increase sales for your small business on Instagram. This app only costs $3.
do you know? Skeletor is He-Man's uncle, his real name is Keldor.  Skeletor was defeated in the throne struggle with He-man's father, the King, and then turned into Skeletor.
Why isn't this a Live Action movie for the theaters?  Could have been a trilogy or more.  And, most people don't have Netflix.
Wow they side line the Hero of the franchise while turning the leading lady into a Man at least make  Teela an Amazon or Wonder Woman not man with daddy issues ..bruh.....
Bachpan ki yaad dila di
Who remembers Adam and Julie jumping into that "Cadilac" 34 years ago ?
Netflix is really Freudflix, isn’t it 😉   Woke propaganda on a global scale.
i can't believe they're making the same mistake again !!! the cartoon looks just as bad as the disappointing cheese from 2002. that's just not the way the kids from the 80s knew and loved it. And maybe a computer-animated series, which is toon-technically closer to the original characters from 1983 ( just cooler locations and more atmospheric) would have been the better choice.  And something for the german fans:  Meine Kinder haben den Trailer gesehen und gefragt: "Warum hat Orko so komische Augen? Warum sehen Adam und Skeletor anders aus? Warum dies und warum das?"  Meine Kids wollten auch so etwas wie das Original von damals auf das ich sie wild gemacht habe. Sie sind auch etwas enttäuscht.
WE NEED A THUNDER CATS REBOOT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well, it is Netflix. Can’t say I’m surprised.
Incel Womanhating Men's Club members: "Wait, a woman has a prominent role in this? AAUUUGH CANCEL CULTURE WOKE AUUUGHH!"
Unfortunately it's new for current generation kids
*i have the powerrrrrrr* !!!!
As a child I was a big fan of He-man. It is so nice to  be watching this with my son
Wowwww grew up watching this dam.
I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!
…A female will have a more prominent role in a show where it wasn’t really there originally? WOKE, WOKE I SAY
Also why the hell is he so skinny, prince Adam was in pretty damn good shape
I HAVE THE POWER
Skrletor better still be a sassy somethin-somethin
Huhuhu this so good
Guys the show isn’t out yet don’t shit on it too hard…
When will there be a normal animation?
ഹീമാൻ്റെ ശക്തിയെ .. 😘😘
So basically Teela is the new he-man and prince Adam is the new Teela.  I can't wait until this current year political nonsense goes out of fashion.
Goosebumps ❤️🔥
I only Heard Eternias
Why is teela the main character better not be because of this feminist bull crap, and why doesn’t he have a cross no matter. Everything is so political now it’s annoying
The tailer is really impressive! And Beast-Man and Evil Lin switch sides. That's rad. Who made this awesome soundtrack in this trailer?
Taistelu-Jaska!
ith nammade He-Man alledave
Finally after 20 years it's back 🤟the 90s kids 😎
Clownfishtv was right
What a woke crap.
He-man the white supremacist dressed as an LGBTQ member
looks shit
They have to destroy my childhood
Zisch zisch, ich bin die Ebenenspinne!
Its better in telugu
Ah well, another one bites the dust.
I built a life of truth away from magic and now you want me to save magic.   What were we ever fighting for? Being a hero swallows you whole.   Jesus it sounds like she’s going to be a right barrel of laughs.
Hindi language plz
He-Man? should be She-Man in this Woke times.
Humans understand this is not just a movie it’s show u sings Jesus is coming brothers and sisters repent for our lord thy god is coming
Evil-Lyn, Lena Headey narration... ♥️
Is he-man a sidekick in this..
He-Man: has the power 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He man????
RIP the forgotten 2002 version of HE-MAN 😭❤️

Lets hope it's not "woke" 😕
God knows why I am crying watching this trailer....maybe an emotional nostalgia.
woke trash
The more I see, the more I love it😍
I grew up watching this 😢
where is the tiger?
Wow I didn't know this was getting made. I thought Netflix has been doubling down on chick fantasy.
Smells like pseudofeminism

Hay Woke oppressors we just won't watch.
Telenovela
Buffy the buffster
Remember when Kevin Smith shit talked Clownfish TV for leaking rumor, and calling out the fact He-Man is a side-character to Teela?  Well this trailer pretty much confirms to me that clownfish TV was right, and Kevin Smith has gone woke. Move aside He-Man!  Independent, strong , lesbian, Teela,  don't need no man!

The hype is real
The more of these previews,I watch, the more I'm starting to think this could be a stink.
It will be very good if I can watch it in hindi language.
Geez. Can hollywood do anything nowadays without making it be all about female empowerment,  being woke,  forced diversity, making straight characters gay?  Seems to me it turns off about 80% of the people just to appease to the 20%.   Its not as if Hollywood doesn't know this....but they force-feed it to us regardless. Also. They must have some real insecurities...because they stop at nothing trying to demasculate or make caucasion blonde guys look bad, villianise them or seem unimportant. Cartoons , commercials, movies. Will it ever stop?
I’m a say this… any 80”s kids that grew up on He -Man, will most definitely watch this series…trust me… I represent that generation that wants to know how tha story line is going to compare to tha original…..
He man😍😍😍😍😍..... where is elumban,,😂😂
Nostalgia
Would sit in front of screen for hours watching this cartoon!
Voice needs to be more deeper and where is by the power of greyskull??? Common don’t change “He man” he is the master’s of universe
So ira gonna be the Her-Man show
Look Netflix, I’m fine with heman not having every second of screen time, but don’t back burner him for some more “girl power” over treaded and cliched bull, alrighty?
The jokes on you, Im into this shit
What the ever-loving woke crap?
01:57 Gangadhar he shaktiman hai
What?
"Grace-skull kootaiyin sakthi....ennul irukum sakthiyeeeeee...." (Bgm: he-man... Tintuku tintuku he-man...) Any Tamil people remember this cartoon in chutty tv like podunga bhaaa
Netflix's only job was to not mess up skeletor's voice.
HE-MAN universe is full of Body Builders
Remember when Netflix got rid of reviews? This is one of the reasons why.
Why does Adam look like chick? 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Yes!
Why try and do the all over again instead of continue
He - man🤣🤣
Oh god, another thing that depends on blinding the people with nostalgia, but it will be more lazy writing, marking the post modernist boxes of things that can happen and cannot, according to the gender and color...oh gad i had flashbacks to "watchmen"... I really hope im wrong, but Netflix have made itself a fame now of making lazy woke crap that are just worth to see because of boredom . Also, just call it Teela, it will be fine, people might even appreciate the braveness of making an alternative story to the 80´s cartoon made to sell toys.
Going in with super low expectations.
I can't wait!
oops where is He man's music 😕
So is this before or after she-ra I'm gonna guess before all tye she-ra stuff because of how eternia is dying but in she-ra it's not so they save it then due then she-ra comes along and saves it again
Trolazo.
He-Man's face looks wrong. Hard pass! PS: I love the old movies :)
I just came.
Hee men
Hug dia animation ne
They maintain old art style...
Still know yhe tune......... aahhh Nostalgia
Ruined the original tune....Was hoping to hear that....
This brings memories. Ahhh🥰
Meh I could do better with herman's look and origin that so desperately needs rebooted.
One of the great cartoons of my childhood has gone PC 'woke'.  When fans see what has been done, they'll tune out.
Wow!! I have been waiting for it soooooooo long
good old childhood memories
🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
If they're gonna get all woke with Teela, shouldn't they change his name to He/Her/Them Man so they don't offend the mentally ill pronoun people? And why is Adam so skinny and why does Cringer sound like a teen douche? This is gonna be hilarious. (´◉◞౪◟◉)
ഹി -മാൻ childhood നൊസ്റ്റാൾജിയ ❤
Old sweet memories 💞
He-man being treated like shi*t in his show. WTF is this?  😒
Big red flags ..this is about Teela  isn't it ?...and why is Prince Adam looking like that ?...Prince Adam was still  built like HE-MAN..he just changed into his loin cloth and battle armour...obviously I'm going to watch this HE-MAN was my hero as a kid But I'm very worried this is going to be another one of my childhood franchises getting absolutely destroyed...Kevin Smith better not have gone "woke" in Eternia...I will never purchase anything he makes again..HE-MAN was the last great 80s Hero that hasn't had the new woke reboot.. id like to leave it that way...
He man
Hey Netflix can you dub it in hindi
I'm looking for bird girl 🙁
That's a respect, willing to take
It's He, Ma'am!
People are forgetting this series is split into parts. Part 1 will likely be placing He-Man’s story on the side as he will be on a journey of returning to grace, he’s clearly lost something that he needs to get back to regain his power or whatever the situation is. Teela will take center stage, but part 1 will conclude with He-Man returning to form and retaking the spotlight heading into part 2. IMO this is a great way of building up into the main protagonist of the story while also providing a great deal of room for the side characters to develop and showcase their own capabilities and depth.
It was only me who guess it 😜 HeMan
As both a cold of the 80s and an animator, I don't care for the art style. It looks too digital. The "ink" lines are too thin.
His "I have the power!" Thing, can definitely use more cowbell!
Is He-man in this? I don’t get this trailer what am I watching?
Looks this might be something to see..
He-Man 👌😘😘😘🥳
It's the teela show not the he-man show, oh and to sucker the 80's fans into buying the toys for silly prices, I'm a asian guy from the 80's and grew up loving he-man and the positive messaging of the show, this show is pure ideological trash, obviously Kevin Smith and Netflix forgot that the new she-ra show exist's on Netflix, Pathetic.
Since when did Battle Cat can talk?… 🤨
Why do female protagonists always have a permanent frown? To be a strong female character you always have to be in a bad mood, 🐂💩.
I wish there were a re-boot of he-man in this "big boy" style animation, but with cheese factor of the original on maximum settings
Looks amazing but I can already whats going on here. This ain't gonna be about He-Man... and fucks sake thats gonna suck.  But then again... it's series... who knows. Plenty of growth.
the haircut alone.. says it all 🤣🤣🤣
He man 😀😀
He man ❤️
இத தமிழையும் டப் பண்ரா நெட்ஃப்ளிக்சே!
Nice😊👍, But I still think the 80s graphics and characters are looks better than this 🤔
This feels very empty without the old he man theme music
This children's show is sure triggering a lot of adults.
Got a bad feeling from this I reckon its gonna be 💩.
It's not He-Man it's Te-La
Not watching this trash, I'll stick with the original 80's show where the story centres on he-man fighting evil and the ordeal on how he deals with each threat and the lessons he has to learn to be a better person, I'm not interested in the teela show and her quest to find the magic power, it's clear to me this is a despicable malicious show injected with woke ideologies and disrespects the original show, it makes me wonder after seeing that trash trailer 2, how many episodes has teela as the lead character and how many episodes has he-man as the lead character fighting evil.
DOPE! Are they going to make toys now too? Someone tell me!!!!!!!
പണ്ട് HE MAN കൊച്ചുടീവിയിൽ കണ്ട കാലം ഓർമ വരണു 🔥❤️🔥   HEMAN grayskul കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി  എന്നിലേക്കു വാ ഈ പുലിയില്ലേക്കു വാ Heman ta ta ta tata taa ta.....
The meme anime
I was so excited about this. But same Woke trash is gonna take over. Why don't people understand? We cannot replace Ellen Ripley in Alien and Sarah Connor in Terminator, In the same way we cannot sideline He-Man and make Teela a lead character. Why Netflix?
Never been so excited for an animation. If they could malayalam dubbed audio to the actual movie, I am out of words.  HE-MAN
I’m an 80’s kid and a purest but I’m definitely gonna give this a shot.
Eh, I'll probably watch it.
Looks corny as Fck!!”  “I’ll stick with my reruns from my Teen 80’s that I grew up with…as those are 10 times better than this Generation Z blasé blah blah redux…
They lost off on a real chance to release this during pride month
Ah yes, Teela has that "strong independent woman haircut" and anti "male-gaze" design. The "new" female character standards, just like how people wanted.
MAHI YAHIIIIII MAHI YAHOOOOO MIHI YAHI MAI HI HAHAAAA
Why does it look like He-Man not the main Character.
It's like a much crappier version of the 'vindilators' from Rick and morty
Who needs superman or ironman when we have He-man🤩🤩.Childhood memories..
I don't care untill you put Attack on titan on the list..
Well, I've got goosebumps all over
I don't remember Abby being on he man as a kid
Had to turn off She-Ra today. Don't really want my 7y/o daughter watching lesbian relationships develop. I have no doubt He-Man will make out with Man-At-Arms at some point this being Netflix and all.
The story is... You know what I'm not even invested in the story I'm just wanting to know why some characters are where they are like the cyclops guy he looks like he is the Main bad guy and skeletor is what gone in the first episode? And Again... WHY THIS SHAVE HALF HEAD LOOK why not shave completely to a Buzz cut. I'm unsure what the hell is going on here it felt lost in a trailer aspect. I think most of this trailer may be the first episode and half
I sincerely hope the dont make my childhood hero woke. and I sincerely hope this wil be epic and not a water down feminist view of he-man.  no body wants to see a wihney tila..  pls pls pls let it be about  HE -MAN
I'm confused... Which one of those is Teela? The one that looks like Teela or the woman that looks like He-man?
not this.
The first trailer got me supper excited about this series. This trailer, not so much
YES!    *SKELETOR!!!*
We're still doing Revelation/Resurrection/Reckoning/Legacy/Rising subtitles in 2021? Come on...
Love death and robot 2?
LOL they changed the name of the show so it doesn't sound sexist but it's stil masters of the universe not mistress 😂😂😂
Garbage... anything on nutfux is trash... what a panzy ass story built on NO BASIS WHAT SO EVER!!
Typical. Of course these woketurds would ruin a classic. Again, they're running out of creative ideas.
🤯 Nice! Finally, He-Man gets an awesome movie!
You mess this up Netflix and I’ll cancel my subscription ✅✋
I grew up watching He-man. You can thank the bots for most of the likes on this one.
He man
I am all for feminism but if they take He-Man and make it all about Teela then Netflix can shove the series up where the sun don't shine.
Like the music
Too much robot chicken in my head
The most powerful man in the universe!!
Omg  He-Man &  Skeletor are back 80's Woooooooow
this animated serious have to live up on it's name "he man"
Can i watch this without watching he man
If this goes well I hope they consider The Thundercats !!!
Hail to all 90's kids ... Memories ❤️
i see Conan the Barbarian 😏
Chutti tv😌
Looked like the movie was more about that chick than He-Man.
Teela: Still know the tune? Adam: Some things you’ll never forget  Does anyone else have any idea what they’re referring to? I hope so otherwise, what a strange conversation between them to show us!
I have an 8 year old daughter. She prefers to listen to female singers and prefers to watch female protagonist. Why? Because then she can visualize herself in the role. So if netflix wants to make Teela a more prominent lead then I am all for it. HOWEVER, did they really have to destroy her appearance by making her look like a waMAN? Really netflix?
It appears it is going to be another bad reboot.   It is I have the power not I am the power.
I swear if they bait and switch and make this a chick empowerment shit I’m done
Mark hamil playing as skeletor is all i needed to hear
What cow-dong is this ??   Where is the main man in the title card?   Is this about another over masculine woman thinking that woman are supposed to be masculine and not feminine?
I hope they remake the old he man meme with this new he man. Lol
Do I have to watch the childhood series or just watch this without worrying?
Is Teela's clitoris bigger than He-Man's penis in this?
after a long long time he man is back
Looks awesome. 🙌
Kevin Smith putting his talentless daughter in every project that he works on for what a surprise! That is a major part that some voice actor needs to pay the bills and instead it goes to her when she can live off of her father's money for the rest of her life! Clearly she isn't talented enough to get anything by herself! I'm sure she's a nice person but she is talentless. I mean it's flat-out embarrassing everyone talk s*** on her not being able to get work any other way. Anytime he directed an episode of Supergirl or Flash he always put her on there.
All hype gone..this guys ruin every show..not going to watch teela and masters of the universe
I smell the stench of feminism.  I’ll wait and see what happens
Wtf is a samoflange
I remember watching the original, I don't know how I feel about....
We need in hindi plz
Can't wait for this!!!!. He-man was one of my top 3 favorite cartoons when I was 8 years old.
Duncan has a man-bun?!?
i have high hopes but then i remember netflix's motto. "STAY WOKE!"
This animation style suxs.
E MAN🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks Kevin Smith for the bait and switch. Terrible idea for Last of Us 2. Not looking forward to subverting the audiences expectations like the hack Rian Johnson.
That's not the skeletor I know💀
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYEYYAAA
He-man
Not good as the first one which used to come on Doordarshan . That was epic and the theme was awesome .
rejoice the good lord has returned !
Teela Feminazi
This looks great. Haters need to shut the hell up.
Cringer can talk lol
I guess none of you have ever seen One Punch Man? That's why He-man isnt going to be there all the time, because he always wins. Let's see Eternia struggle for a bit and be interesting.
So is this a sequel? Do I need to watch all the old he-man episodes to watch this?
Good take on why Eternians would be considered "Masters of the Universe" - that always felt out of place in the original. I really enjoyed the 2002 reboot and wished it had gone on for longer.  Looks like 20 years later, we finally get our wish.
Wow, Teela's new haircut is straight up trash. I really don't understand why all female superheroes this days have to have that dumb ass Undercut hairstyle, it always looks terrible.
Still prefer the old one👌
So who’s gay now huh? Also which new black lesbian trans pansexual character will put him in his place while he stumbles around like a idiot?
Looks like thunder cats
கிரஸ்கள் கோட்டையின் சக்தி!! என்னோடு இருக்கும் சக்தியே!!!!
I feel like they should have a little fan service by joking about “jokes on you I’m into it”
Can’t wait to watch this! The animation looks superb
This looks insanely good. Can't wait.
Why does Adam look like a skinny little prick? In the original He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which this supposedly picks up on the end of that series, while Adam wasn't He-Man buff, he was still built.
er...this does not bode well for "he" man
HE man
Wow He man ❤️❤️❤️
This show should be called The Teela Show. As many predict, Adam is stepping down, where Teela shall replace him. Even this trailer shows Teela taking more initiative than He-Man. If proven wrong, this show is worth a watch, as the animation is crisp and beautiful~
I HAVE THE POOOOOOWWEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!
So, She-Man
wow
please don't be avatar-ish like the rest of netflix animation. they ruined castlevania please not this one
Please .... Please don't make this woke. I promise to pay for my own Netflix account.
a live-action movie would have been better, but I would not like to see a ripped masculine woman anywhere.
Am I the only one who thinks it's a little bit sad that the only knowledge new generations have from He-Man is "the meme"? (you know which one), I mean, nothing against the he-man meme, it's funny and everything but that is not He-Man... I really hope this show is able to redeem the real He-Man from the 80s to popular culture.
Next..Conan the Barbarian 👍👏🙏
"Behold the lord of destruction"(with evil laughter) ~Beerus enters with an ice cream 😈
He Mann
After years of waiting...my childhood hero is back..
❤️Love to see my childhood memories back ❤️🔥
Heman 😃😃😃
No He-Man, so no ideal role model for the boys. Ugly non-feminine Teela, so no ideal role model for the girls either.  Yeah, I bet this’ll be a success that kids will remember when they are adults… 🙄
Why is everyone here concerned about “politics”. One of the main characters is a girl, get over it and stop being so angry over nothing.
From what I've read this is a bait&switch. The Show will focus on Teela, relegating He-Man to a supporting character.
July 23rd : He-Man (i am the power)  July 24th : Deontay Wilder will get an ass whopping
*HE-MAN*
I came here for....I HAVE THE POWER....
One Word.... BADASS
HE MAN
I have half the POWER!!!! EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES....Not quite as catchy.
Whatever it is .. please don't ruin my childhood memories.  . ...  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Whoa 😳
Wish it is not as woke as She ra I hoped for this show to be better
അള്ളാഹ് ഇതു നമ്മുടെ ഹീ-മാൻ അല്ലെ😬
Oh thank goodness you all created a politically correct version of a classic. You will save the world one sjw at a time. Bravo 👏🏻
It's time HE-MAN got a grown up makeover. Very excited!
This trailer screams He-man a bench warmer.
thanx netflix
Soy Iván 1:56 y soy un trolaaazoooo!!!!
this is terrible copy of original.
Dear Netflix please upload this in hindi also
We want all animes in hindi also
Oh my childhood
I feel that somehow like everything else this will also be ruined by politics.
Amazing if it was in 3Dand made by Square enix that would be the best Animated Movie like Final Fantasy
divided just like every fandom
6000+ people that grew up watching Pokémon seems offended
Ye  ben 20 neegala😆
I love the strong woman but eew at the *toxic masculinity also no people of colour, lgbtqxyz1234#%&.* The show needs to take some hints from the hit CW tv show *Batwoman.*
This is gonna suck! Tela is gonna beat He-Man that is really gonna stupid
He-man
Where is that heman music..wtf Netflix 😣..
'He a Man' but the job has just been given away
Missing the music "By the power of Grayskull" and background "He man" chanting
this looks awesome!
*HE-MAN* 🔥
All this woke SJW/feminism BS taking over everything that had a meaning in some generation childhood and turn into female "empowerment." While at the same time trying to please a handful of people born with meantal and hormonal disorders. As a result, we now have biological males taking over female sports. Woooow is this progress. Just you wait Teela. Soon will He-Man start calling himself He-Wemen.
I thought the show was called  Is he man
Is tamilDub available for this series 🥺
This is a great Netflix show I'm going to watch after Trese is about Master of the Universe
It's cool and awesome and all, but isn't this trailer kinda filled with spoilers?
So he man gets emasculated by Tila more left wing propaganda
E man
i had fun as child watching He-Man it did not age well and this looks incredibly boring and cheesy ill definitely watch it though,for old times sake and curiosity.
Where's Orko?
He mannn
He Man??
I didnt see Orco and Cringer.
"DERP I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF HE-MAN"  Yeah, cause Masters of the Universe had precisely thirty THOUSAND characters.
Please dubb Tamil language ❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
It's gonna be woke and it's gonna bomb.
Not naw but.....HELL NAWWWWWWWWW! 🤣 What is this ''woke He Man'' really about.
Love hearing Sarah Michelle Gellar’s voice in this ❤️
it looks way too serious to be as good as the 80's version
Promising... Skeletor doesn't seem to be lovable now but evil. Netflix be bringing back old shows, love it
It's about time Netflix. But, you gonna put she-ra before he man though
Very cool animation, reminds me of Aeon Flux
Not seeing a lot of He-Man in this. Why does Teela look like a dude?
I think this will be as short lived as the new Thundercats series & Voltron series were. I know these are new & different times but, the old cartoons just had a special kind of magic behind them. I did enjoy the new Voltron very much in the beginning but, then it went to crap in the last few episodes. It feels like Netflix is trying too hard to rekindle flames that were never really extinguished.
It was looking well and now here we go. Oh well... sorry He-Man.
Another sad woke treatment of a childhood beloved classic. 😒
By the power of greyskull
Really thank the directors and the team for the movie.. they have brought back all the childhood memories 😍. Best part they haven't changed the way the characters looked and the punch lines are same.. that's was made it more special.. 😍😍 " I have the power" !!! 😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Hindi dub
He-man 😍😍
why is there a butch?
Sucks
Can you just stop with the CGI fake ass shit already?
Hell Yeah!
im gonna get into this shit
Lame af
He man looked evil with those eyes
Hmm I hope they show more of orco and the sorceress :// they are my favs !!!
Being netflix im surprised skeletor is not all white and heman trans. Ill make a prediction... Teela says the day at the end!
He-man 😂
ഗ്രേറ്റ്സ്‌ക്ക്ള് കോടയുടെ ശക്തി 🔥🔥
Wow, this comment section really is a cesspool of insecure older men complaining about their wee little feelings getting hurt because the show isn't looking to be exactly the same as it was during their childhood 40 years ago. Talk about a bunch of snowflakes.
Why can't He-man have all of the screen time in his own show?
Sapeeeee!
I bet he-man kiss a man at some point
Golden memories rebirth. One of the best childhood memory- He Man  Really wonderful
_______kottayin sakthiyee ...he-man. Ta da ta ta ta da da
Childhood memories updated thank u Netflix
Awesome.
He man
The rumors were true. He Man it's a guest in his own show. Pfffff
Can not wait looks amazing but why is Alan Oppenheimer not doing skeletor again?
chutti tv tamil he man 😂😂
I have the powerrrrrrrr
lol
Full nostalgic... 😍
Brings back memories.
Looks incredible, story wise..... we'll see.... I can forgive a partial he-cuck/+1 stunning and brave man-woman, just don't go full he-cuck.
MMMmmmm.............
They just had to go and give Teela the Karen haircut. She looked perfect in He-Man 2002
So...it's the show more about the girl I suppose
MYAH
Bachpan ki yad agai, every Thursday 4:30pm......
“HAH JUST LIKE A WOMAN” - Skeletor
Remember that old meme?   Barbie: Hi, I'm Barbie, an unrealistic, unhealthy, and unfair standard of beauty, leading to a crisis for young girls and their self-esteem. He-Man: I am He-Man, the most powerful man of the universe!
Malayali ille evde He-man 😁😁🔥🔥🔥🔥
we in 90's anime? lol
He Man
By the power of grey skull .. I have the powerrr
Kewl
I am not into it bcz i am not from America
It would have been better if the name was He-man 😐
Where is sheera?
ഗ്രേസ്കൾ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി........ ഹാ രോമാഞ്ചം കൊച്ചു tv............. Nostu...... ♥️........ 🥰... മലയാളി ഇവിടെ come on
Grew up with the old show/original and there's an upgrade? That's epic dude
If he-man isnt the main character this will be trash
He MAN THE BEST OF THE BEST..
This is He-Man right
THey left the nlyimportant question: Is fisto in the serie ?
Ok, Netflix, hear me out.  I watched He-Man for the testosterone-buff muscles, the corny transformation, and the freaking meme.  It wasn’t until I was older did I enjoy the whole of it as presented in the early 2000s.   As a female watching Power Rangers, TMNT, and other “boy shows,” it bothers me to see the few female characters that those shows had become butch lesbian types when in their original forms helped girls like me who had shapely bodies to be alright with them.  You can be feminine while still kicking butt.  One doesn’t have to be sacrificed for the other.   So long as you continue to tout the admittedly twisted and sexuality-charged views of these beloved franchises, you’re just going to drive it into the ground…. Or is that your endgame?
SAPEEEEEEEEEE
IVAAAAN EL TROLAZOOOOOO xD
He Man will become Trans Person.
And I said " HEEYAAYEEEAYEEAH"
Perfeito
Its copy of He-Man remind my chindhood..
Without the great Skeletor laugh, never mind.
SJW BS
He-Man is back once again
So Kevin Smith lied through his teeth.
I want to see a version of She-Ra like this.
Wokeflix
With a return of He Man  There will be Thundercats
Please release in Tamil dubbed
Looks like this series has an unhealthy number of weaponized fems in main charracters. Storyline will be a some piece of shit. Grafic style is awesome nonetheless.
But...the show is named He Man....
the designer of the new He-man, obviously didn't understand that the sword is linked to Grayskull, the sword's two sides are meant to be bone shaped, and the middle of the sword is not a gem (that would be She-ra's sword).  Just because "man at arms" didn't understand it, doesn't mean Netflix has to follow.  And poor He-man gonna cut his back when he puts the sword there.  Wait... is it a blunt sword? No it should be a fat & heavy katana now.  ?Heavy Japanese sword... that the weight crushes the enemy?  (Don't be mean, knowledge is limited here, haha!)  or He-man's skin is so tough?  If his skin is tough, then why he needs a shield on the left?  So the sword is not sharp enough... Wait... He-man's sword is for transformation only, not used to cut.  Now I get it, and the sword lost power through the years, that is why now he needs armour & shield.  Lets give Superman a shield too, and Goku an armour, that would look cool! ;)
Are they trying to make Teela the new "He-Man" like character? I thought that perhaps this is a story about her that leads back to reestablishing "He-Man" again after something was lost but it is not looking like it.
Skeletor after seeing this : "WAT?"
I'm into this.
I NEED A HERO
Can't imagine what it would be like if he met She-ra... even though they're siblings.
Hindi dubbed
Wait so the rumours of a bait and switch might be true?
He-Man sidled in his own show 😂
I was totally buzzing for the show after watching the movie teaser trailer but after watching this. Nope 👎 teela and the masters of the universe 😂😂😂
Trans-Teela looks TERRIBLE
Power of grascal
Might as well just call it “She-Woman and the “Masters Of The Universe”. We are so politically correct.
He-man and The Masters of the Universe......This was my first ever comic book that I ever read and owned. Ohhh brings back memories 😊😊😊
Why isn’t it He-Man and the Masters of the Universe🤔
Waiting da Thambi....
When shit goes really bad you super women can fend for yourselves
Animation , oh it’s anime , anime
Please Netflix. Don’t fu@k this up.
So he man isn't the main character..that def puts me off this show a lil
anime adaption of he man lol
Teela Feminazi
1:37 all I see and hear is the running meme
Now you know why this wasn't a Red Flag since Kevin Smith was announced to work on this.
He man is love for 90s kids ❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait for episode 2, where He-Man changes his name to Ze-Person
I'm just gonna come right out and say it now with a somewhat bold and somewhat stupid prediction for the next two reboots.      Captain Planet and the Planetiers and S.W.A.T Cats.    Because the former is completely random and from around the same time period. And the latter was actually intended for a 2016 reboot on a different channel but something happened with someone aquireing the rights.  Plus, ya know . . . F U R R I E S. 🤣😼😼
Animation looks good...... I was a huge fan when I was a young kid, had the he-man figurine that you put caps into so it made a bang when you wound his fist up and a few others.....but looking back at it now, wow, it was for the very young. It needed an update but i suppose you had that 2002 one but I haven't looked at that.  A couple of criticisms: if this is supposed to be a continuation of the original 80s series....why is Adam looking like a scrawny kid now? Makes no sense. He was always buff! This is supposed to be the adult version of he-man, right? And why is the transformation Adam does to become he-man have rainbow colours in the background? the original wasn't gay like this, not even she-ras was this bad, they were pretty much the same.......it had lightning, fire and stuff, no bright colours! And why isn't he-man in the title of his own show? Since it is supposed to be a continuation and all...... And teela looks very different now too........for no reason other than let's just change it to look more edgy or current day but makes no sense? I hope they are all kept very much the same in personality, voice, temperament.......I  hope the female characters are kept very feminine not masculine like the original.
Missing Kochu Tv HE-MAN 😌😌 ogey bei
That he man voice is so Weak. ..
They made Teela a tomboy... she use to be a sexy hot femenine tomboy, now she is really a masculine-like tomboy (like Pink the singer lmao), don't like it... but, is really interesting to have a bad ass version of Orco.  But, by the few minutes of the trailer, everybody knows this show will be a dissaster at ratings. Then the feminazis will blame the white-heterosexual men and women for not watching it and be empathetic with them, specially at the part of "pathetic".
didn't expect much. netflik animation is getting worse every year.
He-Man
Holy shit ...that last line gave me goosebumps 😌
Skeletor laugh has changed...why
Did I see scareglow?
I will be honest. I rarely thumbs down content. This was a very disappointing preview to a real classic that was remade. I was willing to overlook much, even the side kick He-man. That was until I saw Battle cat speak. No thanks.
ഗ്രെയ്‌സൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി 😂🔥🔥🔥
I'm never gonna see Skeletor as anything but the "I AM NOT NICE" guy ngl
How much gay overtones is in this?
guessing this is the new woke version that they will ruin it the series with.
Did Battlecat talk before? lol
I watch mostly anime but this looks freaking cool
I feel bad for his back
Why is prince adam so scrawny?
Best thing about this series is I don't need subtitle to understand. It has Clear and normal accent.
Love Sheera and TPOP but I'm so here for this!! Put me at the front of the streaming line please!!
I don't even like MOTU like that and this looks really good! I may just give it chance!
Guessing Netflix will have He-man come out on this one
In tamil there is a guy called " irumbu thala Anna "
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww...
He man?…..
So what I took from this. We will see He-Man in beginning see him do his thing. THEN it’s the Teela show for majority of series. Then she saves He-man gives him his sword and thats when the “you still remember the tune” line is said. Bait and switch rumors seem true. This isn’t  He-Man show it’s a Teela show. Which is fine just tell us that. Don’t make a show Wok just to make it Wok. Just make good show without shoving it down our throats. It doesn’t help or do good to any side.
I thought it would take me back but it didn’t….. I was hopping an looking for a more aggressive tone for a more adults but nope.
Heman 🔥🔥🔥
NETFLIX - If u read this, give me a Battle Beasts and Sectaurs next!!! And THUNDERCATS! ✊
Hopefully netflix doesn't ruin He-Man by adding some kinda woke garbage...
🍳🍳
Heeeeeeeeeman invincibles version!!!remake thundercats also!
Holy shit Netflix.....hooollllyyyy shiiiittt
This is basically an uno reverse card in video format
More gore in he-man!
O He-Man não é o personagem principal mais? O.o
That splitting of the sword better be because He-Man and Skeletor have to work together at the end (which Skeletor will screw up during a sudden but inevitable betrayal).
Plzzz in hindi
Oooo hoooooo
We badly need tamil dubbed pls pls
One of my favorite show
Hmm, even tho I saw him there’s not much of Man At Arms
Fun is laughing exactly when Skeletor laughs, with him 'ha ha ha haaaa'
I swear, this show was made on a bet. A bet that, "There is no way you can convince anyone who didn't grow up with this show that these designs and these concepts could be badass." That guy, I cannot believe to say, lost.
OH MY GOD YES NOW MAKE IT GAY
Meh
It has come full circle ! The cartoon of my childhood.
Simp-Man!
I'm curious as to what rating the series will be? Will it be rated for everyone, mature or what?
looks like HE MAN
H stands for He-Man. Im Expecting to see his pet 🐅 🗡
By the power of Grayskull...I have the power!!!
Prince Adam looks like a chick! Why? Lol why to the women look more manly than Prince Adam? Even in his introduction as Prince Adam before turning into he-man, he looks manly!
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside~
Well here we go... Netflix gonna sjw this show up.
Ahahhahahahaha
To me tremendo aq ja
This Will be about He-man or is other woke garbage history? Thank.
I guess Teela’s going to be the main character. Hm…They should also do a Ninja Turtles cartoon where April O’Neil is the main character. Maybe remake the original Spider-Man cartoon, but Call it the Mary Jane Watson Show instead.
They'd better have Evil-lyn kick ass in this.  One of my favorite characters.
Armin vs Ainz
I love how the characters look more like they did from the 80s series.
Another angst-ridden anime where the action poses are the most important things. Yawn.
People keep complaining that man at arms daughter..who's name still escapes me...is supposedly the main role in here...honestly I don't see it. Sure she has more lines in the trailer, but it's the trailer people, come-on.
Will He-Man make it past the first episode Netflix?
My boy He-Man, what are they doing to you?!
I was waiting for skeletor
That trailer was like Teela and the Master of the Universe, oh and some side character called He- Something? He-Not the main character, He-May Not be in the first episode, ahhh He-Man... Please don't be triggered.
Love that they can anime He-Man, a terrible show like this, but do Record of Ragnarok dirty af.
VERY GOOD 👌🏻
Absolute nostalgia! But i can guarantee it will be ruined with an SJW twist.
Fe-Man!! And the Masters Of the Universe😂.
Everyone: talking about how He-Man in getting sidelined in his own story. Me: Are we going to mention She-Ra in this at all... I know its a different animation company, but still ..... mind fuxk of the century potential😳
Q DAHORA MEU PARCEIRO MDSSSS
Somebody getting killed in this show ! Bets?
Looks better than "trese"
Sounds Gay and they also changed his Cross off his chest.  It’s a no from me dawg
Where is heman tune
He Man
What isn't he shouting He-man
DRINKING GAME! Every time an idiot incel uses the word "woke", take a drink!  I've been here six minutes and I'm off my ass!
Really hope it is not Super WOKE BS!!!!
Might as well title this Tee-La and the masters of the universe.
....I have the power
I’m sure I’ll get ratioed for this but I’m finding Teela’s voice annoying. The show does look good though.
Enough with the trailers....... IM SOLD!!!!!!!!! bring it on!!!!
Ok. Now i'm confused, we've got a Karen Teela, who will be the main hero??? Oh god, please don't ruin this
Where is black tiger😓
Why did they not get Alan Oppenheimer to do Skeletor?  I love Mark Hamill, but Oppenheimer is going around to comicons to this day, doing Skeletor impersonations and signing autographs.
So a show called HE MAN is not about He man??
Ficou uma droga. Bem Netflix mesmo!!!
What is this divided sword? Blackstar reference? I think they should remake Filmation’s  Blackstar animation .
i better not see anyone mentioning she-ra in here 🤨
Anyone else got goosebumps?
another feminist shit!!!! well, another lie spitted to the public who recieved with open mouth. cheers

So... Skeletor's back. That's honestly all I got from that.
Love the animation, but is it me or does this trailer gives off a feminist woke stench.  If its woke, I am out.
there sure are a lot of insecure morons in this comment section. Sorry whiner babies, your culture war trash is relegated to tucker. Go whine about critical race theory and think you’re clever for calling something “woke”  pathetic goons  as for the show-  looks great, can’t wait.
BRING THE MEME BACK!!!!
Awwwwe look they've turned the Teela character into a butch, macho, feminist..  No room for any vulnerability... Unless you are a white, heterosexual male, then you can be the biggest pansy the world has known.
Chills man. Thank you for bringing this back Netflix
HeMan.! 🔥🔥
thanks Netflix for completely ruining another TV series that was once amazing
He-Man my favourite 🥰
He-man ?
I'm calling it.  If you're a He-Man fan, you're about to be REAL disappointed.  Sorry.
As long as Stinkor is in the series, all will be right in the world.
Doom Eternal's source of inspiration just got updated for the "newer generation"
ஏலும்பன் returns 🔥🔥🔥
The pizza he-man! EAT IT!!
Can't wait for an hd rendition of the music video
By your powers combined! *I AM CAPTAIN PLANET*
Whatever I see Skeletor I remember overlord.
Damnnnn
When did Kevin smith start drinking so much soy?
" I have the Power" still gives me goosebumps...
I was just showing my daughter He-Man toys in Walmart today!! Can't wait to watch this with her!
Reminds me of my childhood days when I used to read he-man comics a lot;still like those comics.
Kevin Smith putting his talentless daughter in every project that he works on for what a surprise! That is a major part that some voice actor needs to pay the bills and instead it goes to her when she can live off of her father's money for the rest of her life! Clearly she isn't talented enough to get anything by herself! I'm sure she's a nice person but she is talentless. I mean it's flat-out embarrassing everyone talk s*** on her not being able to get work any other way. Anytime he directed an episode of Supergirl or Flash he always put her on there.
I'm sorry but I want pure testosterone and Muscle in this.
As long as I get back the original Skeletor voice, we good!
I just thought for a moment it was He-man and the Masters of Universe but that was in childhood now he man is just a side hero.
I'm 42 years old and excited
He-man fav of my childhood 😍😍
This is a bait and switch, he man won't be in this for the whole series or will be just a side character for the plot. It will focus on the Female characters, yes guys he man is now a feminist+LGBTQ series. Good luck
Something tells me that, as Netflix usually do, this woke show will focus on Teela either being a lesbian or transgender, and a little of He-Man being a powerless white folk, or him being part of patriarchal oppression! Ouch Netflix, not again! 😴
Change the name to Teela and the Gay Squad
He man...
This is going to "pick up" where the 83 show left off
Chutti tv la release pannunga
voice actress ........ like......too                                           DICKHEAD    what R U DO???????? NETFLIX?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Just call it what it will be:  Masters of the Universe: How Communist Netflix Destroys He-Man 2021
is this He-Man´s or She-Male show?  please clarify.
I think they should have modernized his gear instead of having the conan vibe going.
This trailer is....a little peculiar
He man has a tiny head
He looks better in real series
Freaking LGBT colors as HeMan transforms 😕
Looks like another of silent bob’s dumpster fires. Hey Teela, go make me a sandwich
Oh this is Teela's Bizarre Adventure's right?
I have a nagging suspicion that this will be a SJW cringe-fest. There goes another childhood show ruined.
Why dose Tila have a lesbian haircut ???🙄
Loved castle vania, but not sure this was entirely called for imo
Masters of Woke shit
Masters of the Woke-Iverse ????????
The art style is epic. Hoping the rumors about Teela being the main character are false.
He-Man is a trans? It is Netflix, we should expect the worst.
I had to look it up but damn I didn’t know he man was literally the strongest in the universe. Does that mean is above all gods and celestials?
I think thanos!
Is it just The ThunderCats rebooted ?!!!!
All i could listen was heyyeyaaeya
HEYYYAYYYAYYYAYYA
Looks lame. Unoriginal Gen X management 🤦
The He-Man movie with Dolph Lundgren was disappointing.
Nice
Thank you for the immense discrimination against men! We have to be tall, muscular, successful, abundant and handsome, but a hero like He-Man has to give up his status as main character, because some over privileged sensitive sissies...? Wow, Manhood is definitely doomed...
Netflix and the masters of agenda
HeMaN  he is back
After 35 years this what they come up with?
Woke-man hahaha
Can not wait to watch this
Annnnnd of course. Everything seemed awesome, a great return. But of course He-Man is just extra. So what will it be now She-Man or She-Woman? This is like having StarWars return and making original characters die. Wait.
He-Man felt like a secondary character. No love to man at arms. They just basically dumped on the characters of the original series so some girl power can take place? Did anyone who watched and actually liked the original show have anything to do with this series? Screw you Netflix.
Graiskal kottayude Shakthi enn ullil othunguma Shakthi koodi vaaaaa😜
Thank you Netflix for bringing back my childhood favorite back
Nothing more feminist than taking the most hetero caricature possible as He-man and emasculating him as much as possible, taking away his protagonism in his own show, even playing with subliminal messages by cutting He-man's sword in 2...
I had high hopes but looks like they Are going to make He-Man woke trash
Masters of the Universe: Girl Power trailer
Did he just used "get help" ?
Looks good, makes me think about watching the original series in the 80's
So Kevin Smith indeed lie to us. Teela is gonna be the main character, not He-man.
If He-Man is only a side character I can not see this series being as beloved as I want it to be. All we can do is hope this trailer is misleading.
Great cast also!
Youtube recommended me this video and the HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA one at the same time, wicked.
please please please netflix don't screw up!!!!!
Old 80's and early 90's see this in india,the one had only superhero
Clownfish was right. Kevin Smith is a liar.
Don't cancel this series after one season Netflix 😒
80's = Oh man He-Man and She-Ra is awesome! 2020's = Wait they are mentioning gender in their names and there is no obese and LGBT representatives in this. Is this kids (adult woke/politically correct) safe?
She-Man and the Masters of Cuckverse
Mano esse anime parece 😶🤙 top
He-Man
Animation is good. Why does Teela have a Karen haircut?
I smell the dreadful odor of political correctness...alas...I fear this series is doomed...
I'm surprised the woke public let them make He-Man since it's considered toxic masculinity.. I think they should have made He-person a non binary and throw in some gay character's and to please the woke crowd.. LMAO!!!! And I am outraged that He-person is not a person of color damn this show is racist and homophobic..
..This He-man looks weak..
I have to SHOWER!!!!
The trailer looks solid but I have a few questions or  possibly concerns, Why does it seem like the powered down he-man is so  Feminine, And if this is the future after all of the wars  With skeletor and his minions, Then why isn't he a grown man at this point And still a kid..
ROFL what garbage. Teela cuts her hair off, starts wearing pants (because you know, none of the men are 1/2 dressed, right?) and will be the new star of the show, because in 2021 a white man with blonde hair can't even be the lead in a cartoon. Ill keep fond memories of the 1980s version and skip this woke shit show. Netflix should rename its self WokeLeft flix.
This was better off staying in the 80's
I’m sorry what is this? Why is this necessary? Wtf happened to She-Ra & the Princesses of Power?? Why did they make a whole new story vs. building on what was beautifully done? Do He-man as a She-Ra spin-off like there is so much to work with within that world, and you could have brought old fans and new fans together vs. alienating the new fans that made this shit even possible 😡
i have tHE POWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
DAMB!
Why couldn't they draw Teela as good looking as her new girlfriend girlfriend at 1:16? Why does He-Man looks so sidelined in his own show? Man, the only promising thing in this show is the animation.
I thought this series is about He-Man.
All that bloody magic that was going on and you couldn't have transported Eternians to a more hospitable planet that didn't need magic?
If you read my comment and you dislike this f*** you
Seems to not be about He-Man, probs gonna be woke trash again
Brabão 😠
Dam this thing is old , 40 yrs maybe,  still catches my attention
COOL!!!
Tee - Woman & The Masters of the Universe
Waiting for Netflix to make the final episode... of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS! Will Erik, Bob and the others finally go home? Is Venger the son of the Dungeon Master?
Kinda sad this looks 1000% better than She-Ra.
Teela and The Masters of the Universe should be the the title
I'll bet my 100% disability with the va that he man gets replaced
HE SAID IT 1:55
Not that much impressive, old is gold always
Seems ots the angry woman show. Nah, I'm good
They ruined it.
Serão quantas partes?
Skeletor actually looks intimidating
I wasn't born in the 80s so I never even knew about He-Man till the early 2000s memes.  But this I'm going to watch this just looks awesome!
This better not be no SJW pandering bull shit
I hope they have the original actor doing skeletors voice. Skeletor is hilarious
WTF where is that legandary HE MAN music 🙄
I AM SO MOTHER FRICKING READY FOR THIS
Un cambio total de He-Man
When does resident evil come out
''Some things you never forget.''  ''Alright STOP, collaborate and listen...''
I strongly suspect that this "Revelation" has something to do with feminism and toxic masculinity.
I just try to guess how he pull out or but I back his sword on his back without hurting himself o_0
0:49 Is that King Grayskull from the 2002 series but black?
Damn. Now this is reliving my childhood days 🤩🤩
So did anyone else's inner child bust out your chest?
I have a bad feeling about this.
All the dudes crying that "MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE" isnt primarily about He-man. If it were. It would be called "HE-MAN..."  Get over it. This looks cool.
He man
The animation looks sick a.f. I just wish they they wouldn't have gender swapped Adam and Teela. I liked how on the old school show you could tell the difference between the men and wahmen.
Why does He-man sound he's going to come out. Thanks Netflix for ruining it
Once again, I draw dark invigoration from a sour bunch of comments of all ya'll "whatevers of Odin" complaining about wokeness over a property whose 80s cartoon was one of the most woke, most soy of its generation.  The irony is astonishing.
The way USA is going nowdays, expecting revelation that He-man is gay.
Looks terrible
No fucken way
Funny how He-man seems to be the sidechar to the strong female woman in his own show.... Sort of reminds me of how Simon Belmont was a side char in his own story in Castlevania, Netflix other series... This seems to be a theme.
Every show has to have a "powerful" wohman thats gay or has the side of her head shaved now ...
So He-Man is just gonna be the muscle whenever Teela gets in over her head? The main focus isnt on He-Man and Skeketor?
Master Of The Universe without He Man & more about Teela story ? Nope, i'm out. Have a nice new woke cartoons days from Neflix.
The old skeletor laugh!!!
The title already gives away that He-Man isn't the protagonist here, otherwise it would've had He-Man:Masters Of The Universe Even the Sinopsis doesn't bring up He-Man and is an "Alliance"
Love all the cliched, agenda driven predictions in the comments here.  Think I'll just wait and see.  And I hope it's good.
If He-Man isn’t the main guy and they go woke at all I’m done!!!
YES!!!
the animation looks awful
My favorite show ...
Imma have to wait till catch this on VHS
You better not replace he man with that chick with the half shaved head. Smh
So we hot evil he man now?
Life is complete!
Nice it's back ...make it in tamil series
I always hate heman but this series maybe change that perception
I hope they don’t damage He-Man. And please Netflix do not overly sexualize this show all die the sake of LGBTQ. Smh.
Well, that sucks. Thought there'll be no GP in it. I was wrong, it truly is Teela centered. Previous comments I read was right, sadly.
they couldn't afford to get the original music?? really??
He man looks a little sus
so what is the role of he-man in this series..? The trailers seems made him into support character for side story
Skeletor!
Why is battlecat talking?
Looking good like the fight scenes.😘😘😘😘😘😘👍🍀💕🤗💖
That thumbnail is dumb af. Who sticks a sword under armour like straps that force the sword tightly against your skin. He would get cut up so bad.
I knew He-man was gonna be a side character! This gonna all be women empowerment and shit.
Did i just saw She-Rath in the trailer?
I really hope this is good
Feminism is cancer.
Varian Wrynn: splits sword and dies Saurfang: splits sword and dies He-man: splits sword He-man death confirmed
It took me to my childhood...the line "I am the power"😭😭
So the  Protagonist becomes the antagonist to make room for female savior  ?        1:08 Hollywood is not even trying anymore.
Magic, Magic, Magic, Magic, Magic. Oh yeah and also M.A.G.I.C
Im really really surprised its not HE-TRANS..
Skeletor... I loved seeing him losing everytime when I was a kid... now I Wana see him kick He-man's ass... Times do change hahaha..
Is this He man ?
Kevin Smith... please don't destroy my childhood memories with liberal propaganda.  Please. I saw what it did with starwar fans.
awwww yeaaaah. 👍🏾
this has invicible esque animation
希曼和希瑞 双剑合并！所向披靡！
HD: heyeyeyeyeyheyheyhey i said hey, whats going on
Wtf did I just watch?
The rumors are right, he man is only going to be in the first two episodes of the show. Dang that sucks
Dang. Who made the animations for this show. The body proportions are completely off. He-man's head is too small. Teela's arms (and female arms in general) are inconsistent and wonky. Except for the original armor and designs, the clothing looks incredibly dull and unoriginal. If this is the level of care that went into it, the story will be mediocre at best.
1:57 AGAIN THIS BEAUTIFEL VOICE💖💖💖
THIS IS TRASH
Ok ok Trailer is nice..but Were is the Tiger🐯🐯🐯..the vehicle of He-Man...How many of them searched the tiger in trailer please put the like here 🙏🙏🙏
Hey Netflix where is his tiger????
❤️❤️❤️😭 after a long time dude
I need that, "I HAVE THE POWER!" to be deeper than that. That's all I know.
PUTA Q ME PARIU!!!!💖💖💖💖✨✨✨💖💖✨✨
Is that Cerci  from game of thrones narrorating
Please hindi me bhi dub karna
This series better not be about female empowerment…..they have their own she is called she ra
Dub in Tamil plzzz
I'm a 36 year old man and I'm so watching this!
Nope! As woman myself, I do not like it that they have to make a female character look like...well something not feminine, just to give an impression that she's strong (they just look stupid and ugly!). I prefer that strong female characters look feminine, beautiful with all the curves, but not too much, like the real She-ra. Look at what you did to supposedly Teela (wtf)!?  Don't you get it? A real strong woman is not afraid to be feminine, it is our strength and charm and normal woman does not want to look like that, we want to look pretty even in a battlefield. That is also why manga and anime are more popular and loved, do you see their strong female characters, they can literally kick ass, but still beautiful and graceful. I am starting to think hollywood actually hates women and wanted everyone to just look a man.
Where's Snarf?
so it's about the girl not he-man?
You can tell how much this is going to suck
Wow 😍😍😍
Teela's face looks like a dude with thick lips. That chin is WAY too angular.
Tamil la vidra pundaalaka
HeMan lost his Cross on his chest?
...cersei...?
It's amazing how people already know exactly what this show will be about and how much it's going to suck when it's not even out yet. Must be some kind of Eternian magic!
I hoping for the based based on how they did with Castlevania.  Based on what they have been saying I get the impression Adam is totally getting cucked and this is going to turn into what Shera should have been.
I have a very bad feeling about this
Still holding out for a hero!!
I was looking forward to this. Cant wait for it to flop.
I really don't understand the 'girls need strong role models' thing still going on in 2021. This isn't 1980 anymore with only Sigourney Weaver as a strong woman in film. Video games, shows and movies have tons of examples in the last 20 years. I shouldn't have got hyped over another Netflix show after seeing that the Resident Evil cast wasn't diverse enough.
they shopuld probably stop hiring the castlevania animation and script writing team
She-man and the wokes of the Universe.
Hope he man doesnt become (he/him)
He-man is musclor
This is He-Man
I'm so tired if this fake woke Feminazi shit they keep shoving down are throats
Woah cringer can talk!?
JUST LIKE A WOMAN!!!!
Netflix, The pedophile network. Dont support them.
I said hey... what's going on?
Since this is Netflix.  One way or another it will be SHE-MAN.
He-Woke!
This show is gonna be🔥 Can't wait!
I know everyone is screaming "Woke! SJW!" yada yada, and they might be right. But I'm going to watch it, and if it involved Teela more, but it's still good? Then it's still good. This is part 1 after all, I'm curious as to what kind of storyline they're going to setup.
I have a bad feeling this will be a woke POS.
This is very immature with what I'm about to say But I grew up on He-Man and She-Ra and now I'm 48 yo this year and I can not wait until this comes back on. Netflix got a grown azz woman watching this show. Thanks, Netflix for revising my fav cartoons.
Animation looks familiar?
Ok but why does Teela go from a cool character design to a painfully generic one with a butch haircut?
He Man lost the Iron Cross that used to be on his armor.
This look good though!
hypeee
I have a feeling this is gonna be more about a she-woman or a it-nonbinary character than about He-man because is not woke enough
Seeing a lot of people concerned about how good this show is going to be, and honestly, I get it. It’s intimidating, having He-Man coming back after decades. Why don’t we all measure our expectations, and extend a friendly gesture of goodwill to any ThunderCats fans out there right now? I think they need it more than you guys 🤨
Good ol mark hamill.
ഇത് കൊച്ചു ടിവയിലെ ഹിമാൻ തന്നെ ആണോ😂😂😂
will this series have he-man finally coming out of the closet?
Looks like they're going to do He-Man dirty. Not a fan if that happens
Kirito weapons
Looks gay, pozzed, and bluepilled.
Shame
If this is a Tela lesbian feminist show..It will fail
can't wait for she-man Teela
I keep wondering why He-Man was never in the main title.
The Original Theme is still be Best Ever. I could watch all day 🌟👀🌟
This will fail.
Where. Is. Orco?
Hopefully Kevin Smith doesn't mess this up
Release to tamil dubbed
2021, when even He-Man gets sidelined in his own show.
We'll always have the bad ass irreplacable 2002 series, guys.
sooooooo itsnot about he man......here we go
Why is Adam so skinny
Oh good I can't wait because this will fail
Wont be letting my son watch this...  modern day sjw garbage guaranteed...  Sick of seeing ppl screw up what used to be good for boys.    If u want to make a new show and concept,  and butcher cultural norms there go ahead,  at least leave what once was decent alone.
What’s with Hollywood these days that they need to give every Woman going all tough and strong that lesbian half shaved haircut? And not just Hollywood, you even see it in games like Crash Bandicoot too now. It’s like literally every single Manly Action Man is busting a Boyka haircut.
can we give Teela her hair back please, i'm also assuming that the new girfrind charcter is at 1:16 Not only is adam not the star of his own show, he's also having his romantic interest stolen and having his powers stolen, really sucks to be adam.
Oh no  The last jedi and The Last to us 2.
Oh Kevin Smith what you done, blasphemous cretin.
So here we go again. Looks like women lead the charge. Woke He-Man great. Another blow to my childhood.
He man but he's the sidekick
Another woke trash from USA.   Korean/Japanese movies/series are light-year better.
Will watch this for the love of Skeletor !
Looks like the leaks were true. He-Man definitely does not look like the main focus whatsoever. Teela does, and this looks like just yet another bait and switch where The strong woman hijacks the beloved franchise from the mistreated grips of the main character. That first trailer had me so hype, but this... this is something I'm not watching until people paid to do so have reviewed it first. Not looking good right now though. Strong independent woman that don't need no man is literally a film/tv cliche now. Go figure.
HE-MAN twisted into a WOKE show
It's He-Man bitches!! The ladies are not as thicc like in the original! C'mon Netflix!!
Petition to use orginal he man tune as 1984 was so hyped when I herd do you remember comon it was like slap in the face
Mathe-Mann
He man
why does prince Adam look like he cross dresses when no one is around? can tell if he is a prince or princess.
Teela and the Lesbians of the Universe
They show the only good parts in this trailer...im not gonna waste my time with this series.  ive got the GOOD series - the 2002 He-Man.
I hope Orko won't be a dorko,
This is going to be epic
I can hear a TED saying....F yea in my head
Wheres Hordak? I never seen him in the cartoons only in the comics
I can't barely wait for 34 rule's
Can we please also have a remake of the Dungeons&Dragons (the 80's cartoon) series? Please?????
I recognize Mark Hamill anywhere
All I know is "eternia dies"
i'll skip, that sucks, another atempt to destroy awesome childhood cartoon....1983 he-man is awesome, even stupid jokes and stupid fights, especially when he  draws sword/intro...made that intro into ringtone
Yassss!! …..Where is She-Ra!
"Yo tengo el poder"
Thank God no He-Woman ... Thank you!!
100% de chance da Netflix estragar o he Man e lacrar muito
we want in telugu
Kevin Smith lied to our faces. 🐾
Skeletor sound like mark ,as much as I love the guy I don't like him as Skeletor
Gonna flop hardcore and Netflix gonna be making a confused Pikachu face   Netflix: why did it fail? We gave them their show back. Why are they not liking Teela? We though they wanted the main protagonist of "He-man Masters of the Universe" to be female   Fans: we want He-man  Netflix: aight but what you really want is teela.  Fans: bro He-man the fuq   Netlfix: got you fam, teela it is
90s nostalgia!! Hee mannn....and the masters....of the univerrrrrrsee
This is gonna be awesome!
This show will be a Netflix bait and switch.  Teela will be the MC after the first episode.
Great art.. Interesting choice to feminize Adam and make Tela so masculine that they literally refer to her as Man@Arms. This is going to be awesome 😅🤣😂
Cara, sinto em dizer, mas essa série será pura lacração
Tila tá bombada, preferia o outro modelo Raiz, mais feminino !!
1:55 Purely epic!
Teela is looking butch ,,, Why is she ,the side character narrating ? Sigh .because it is  Woke , Kevin you simp you ruined He man
So the main character is She-man Teela? 😑👎🙄
I wish She-Ra was part of this. If that lame cartoon that was made didn't exist.
The show isn't called He-Man? Why do I get the sense that he will inevitably be emasculated and replaced continually in his story by strong independent female characters who will never need saving but will likely save him countless times in the show?
I can already see the gynocentric character design playing out.....
I absolutely HATE those impact "camera" shakes in animation. So stupid, annoying and contrived.
It’s not He-Man, it’s Masters of the Universe so I guess the rumours about He-Man being a side character are true. I heard Teela is going to be the main character. I don’t have a problem with that as long as they can tell a good story. Maybe in the next season it can be about He-Man and another season about other characters. If they can do it right it’ll be interesting and I’ll support it. BUT if it is going to be some woke garbage writing then there goes the whole franchise in the drain!!
I am the power or # I am heman time change everything but you can't change the good old title b4
passado
So this is all about Teela, who becomes woke....wtf!
Is this related to Netflix sheera?
soy un trolazoooo, me gusta el peeeedaaaaazooooo, lalala la la (8)
Lord of destruction you not that guy trust me you not that guy
nyeeeeeh
He man!? yessir
Im feeling there is she ra
i love how they have made the women buff
This looks epic as hell.
how many episodes before netflix moves a diverse female cast into the starring role of HE-MAN? glad the trailer for HE-MAN was basically a Teela or unknown female sidekick (soon to be heroine) kiss up by netflix.  has the sjw/libtards gone so far that you can't even have a strong white male in a cartoon built around being a strong white male?
In the original series Teela once described her ideal man.  He would have certain traits of both Adam and He-Man.
Whelp the rumors were right.  He Man will be back seated and we get a Teela series.  Can't wait for that BS.  What a waste of amazing animation.  Kevin Smith is a woke sellout big surprise.
Oh netflix. Will you ever adapt something without messing it up?
Bring back the memory from 90s 🥰🥰
Im not familiar with this IP. Is revelation a reboot/remake or a sequel to the original show ?
Wow Teela man and the masters of the universe. No thanks
I'm the master of the univers🗡 HE-MAN💪
I am not seeing what the deal is guys. All I am seeing is that He-Man has to share the spotlight with the rest of the cast and not be the focus. Big woop. Are we REALLY that scared of women getting an equal share of the spot light? Are we really that afraid of the LGBTQ community? Grow up.
Now if only they did Thundercats looking this juicy 😇
If you didn't wanna a cishet white male as a protagonist you could have made him gay. Still watching it because I'm all about that girl power!
É de arrepiar a alma, que trailer Magnífico. Como é bom ver uma obra animada que nos ensina a justiça e a verdade acima de tudo. EU TENHO A FORÇA👊
"I sense some wokeness in the force." - Obi Juan Nairobi
The comments section is always depressing to read... this was no exception
This is gonna be awesome!
Skeletor better be grumpy.
It’s funny how much bitching is taking place without even seeing the show yet, oh that not surprising with this crying and complaining children that are so called fans!!! I know one thing, whether Kevin Smith show sucks or not, he and Netflix took a shot and brought the property off the shelf we’re it’s been sitting mainly like forever!!! I’ll always give him credit for at least taking the shot!!! It’s a lot more then these crying kids will ever do!!!
I    HAVEEEEEEEEE   A     POWERRRRRRRRRRRR    OHHH MY GODD
He- man is not the main character people. The creater already said the wanna be dude red head woman  is the actual main character.
Mark Hamil killing it as Skeletor!
I doubt it but is that Mark Hamill as Skeletor..?
Man! 90s! I still remember as a kid watching this, Heman transforming as well the tiger(?), Vaguely but brought back some of the memories!
SheMan vs HeMan
Come on Netflix don’t f up my childhood 😡
I feel Teela will become SHE RA ...I'm getting the vibe here. FYI this Netflix, so this is the HE MAN for grown ups so characters will DIE.
Is just me or the way his loincloth appears reminds the way those mini skirt appears on the sailor moon transformations?
The 'I have the power' looks and sounds pretty weak compared to the original.
So, Master of the wokeverse? ....ok
Looks great… memories..
Great, another debacle of story telling from the Woke generation. Pathetic. They can't write their own story, so they rip off and ruin someone elses.
Seriously, why do all these "strong and independant" women look exactly the same. Multiple hairstyles exist
I can`t wait for Jul 23 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Cool, the Three Towers, the Sword of Power splitting again is very classic. Prince Adam doing his best Steve Rogers, pre-Serum. Teela's new design doesn't really fit very well with everyone else. Everyone is in bright colored, over stylized outfits and she is in a generic brown padded armor.
He-fan
This must be the "woke" version of "He-Man".
The Teela Show.
It’s funny and good movie. Animated Short Films.
You can guarantee this just be another way for Netflix to push thier feminist SJW AGENDA. guaranteed. There is nothing that can't be infected without thier pushing their political agenda. You can guarantee he man will not be the main protagonist in this. From what I heard it will be a female character.
Is it me or Shazam and He man or like kids that turns into a powerful hero with lighting ⚡️🥴
Woahhh,i like how the fight scenes were made. Will be waiting for HeMan and Skeletor fight scenes👍
I realy hope thay made He Man and Thila Gay or Black, I hope thay Fight toxic masculinity and I hope thay have emigrant in Eternia. Wohoooo go Netflix
Wait why cant he-man just be the main plot and give us all fan service like we actually want?
I miss the original he-man theme music.
Let's watch Masters of the Universe to see Teela..... Said no one ever
did this snowflakes changed the iron cross on He-Man chest with a crooked H?
Teela looks like she wants to talk to Skeletor's manager.
I didn't know Abby from TLOU2 is Playing Teela now. 😆 🤣
I hope skeletor sounds like the original and insults people the same way he used too.
Netflix, please bring the Thundercats
Again no black guy  And yet a black woman is actually in it  Panthro doesn’t count
Man the amount of people bitching over Tela’s look is ridiculous, ya bunch of clowns
no gusto
Wow, how fast the Hype for this show has died
Alot was spoiled in this teaser and now i dont even want to watch it.
Why prince Adam became a pipsqueak? And Teela looks like she is taking male hormones and could bench press prince Adam for 100 reps?!!!
For the last 20 years, when ive been sat struggling on the toilet…a strong burst of “I HAVE THE POWER” from He-Man animated series saved me many’s a time. Good to see it back. Hopefully this will save future generations struggling on the toilet.
Trailer top
the new theme sucks. we want the old one!
IVAN EL TROLAZO: RELOADED
WTF this series si abot Teela?🤢🤢🤢🤢 Foking feminist🖕
This trailer is boring and the "music" is generic AF! Also, who the F* is that half shaven poor excuse for a "strong female character" that keeps buzzing around like an eye sore on the screen? Don't tell me that's Teela?! If it is, all I have to say is: Only someone blasted out of their mind on crack would spew out such a horrendous character design! The same goes for the chumps that approved said design.
Skeletor still needs to refer to his henchmen as bungling boobs; change my mind 😆💀
I remember when the left used to be snowflakes, now it's the anti-woke crowd that whines about dumb shit. Everyone really does become what they hate.
Kevin Smith is the bait n switch gag joke
Holy smokes!!!!!!!!! I have the POWERRRRR!!! Me as a kid in the 80's!! well done netflix, I'll be there!
Looks really good! I saw this on the news headlines! Felt so great they are giving attention to great cartoons now!
Teela:- Masters Of The Bait And Switch.
Hipe super 😍😍😍😍😍
Another pozzed series welp at least i liked the first trailer.
I took a stopwatch and times how much screen time Teela had, it was 20 seconds, Prince Adam/He-Man had 32 seconds, almost half of Teelas screen time had either Adam or He-Man in it.  It ends with He-Mans chest and body glowing, maybe it is the He-Man show after all!
Lixo esquerdistas
Didn't He-Man Destroy the Shaping staff?
Watch this makes me wish that Thunder Cats gets a remake as well
This is a woke Teela spin off.
There are just some things you can never forget.   This is one of them.   Long live the power!
Just like a woman!!!
There better not be a She-Man in this!
Skeleton says, "Myeen"?
Incels in the comments be like "how dare they put women on cartoons that aren't even made for me and i wouldn't even watch if it was made the way i wanted 😡😡😡😡😡"
OMG!!! We need She-Ra too!!!!! 😍❤️
Bait and switch
Sarah Michelle Gellar sounds great as Teela and more confident in her voice performance since Star Wars Rebels. Really hope she's come to grips with Joss Whedon.
There’re more scenes of tela fighting, than he-man fighting in this trailer.. actually. This trailer is 80% tela and 20% he-man.  This series will be frustrating to watch!
SHE-MAN !!!           Remember these words, my He-Man fans ! Don't be fooled by false advertising .
Teela looks terrible.
Make it MA for the win
For the most part this looks great,  but the character design of Teela and Evil Lyn looks shit. They could have been made to look feminine.
Teaser: awesome. Trailer: . . .
Well that was jam-packed, now wasn't it? I think I'll just lay down for a few moments...yeah.
Damn some manly looking women.🤨
The amount of people crying because Teela is going to be the lead character and possibly an "LGBT squad" (I doubt that will happen) almost makes me agree with Alan Moore "A bunch of grownups going to see a superhero movie is such a shame, and shows how intellectually backward they are" something along those lines.
Teela looks awful
He-Man the magical boy! Hell yeah! Hype!!!
that two days before my birthday yay me
Don't  care if its woke or not heman  is awesome
What a literal joke, and there's over 50,000 fools who aren't in on it.
and now lets have a taste of boomer's tears in the comments
Not sure how I feel about Teela going rogue just because she secretly has issues with magic. She may not use it herself but she is well aware that several of her allies use it and neverf held it against them. There is one reason that makes sense and would be plausible. In the 200x Heman Teela was obviously intended to take over as Sorcerres of Castle Grayskull one day and if I wouldn't be suprised if that was the plan in the 80s version too. So maybe the Sorceress gets badly injured and they suddenly drop it on Teela that she has to take over now and that is why she decides to leave.
Yasuke
Check out the hordes of incels flocking to this comment section and putting their pathetic views on full display. Without even watching the show itself you people are already wailing and clutching at your action figure that you retrieved from your mother’s house.
Whole lotta little boys crying in the comments because a female character's prominently shown in the trailer. It must suck to be so insecure.
What's this? Teela kicking more ass in a two and a half minute trailer than She-Ra got to do during all five seasons of her own reboot.  My attention has been piqued.
How could you tell that the show will be a bait and switch, because the show is called Masters of the Universe not He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.
StrongkWomyz side-of-the-head-shaved : Check.  When your fantasy work is timestamped and dated before it's even released.
rule 34 is SO going to have a field day with this
I was so ready for this, but if it turns into the Teela show, I am out!
So..... He-Man is a side character to the Lesbianism of the female characters! Holy wokness Batman!  At least he got to go down on catwoman. Don't see that here with Teela and He-man.
Looks like He man is a secondary character.  woke crap. let's hope Kevin smith never does a batman movie!
I smell femagenda... Is this the name of the new character Femagenda ? xD
People are so bitter in comments over a trailer 😆
Mark Hamill as Skeletor! Nice lol
I wonder what wokisms they've contaminated it with.
Would be Teela the main caracter? I hope not !!!
The comments on here are pretty toxic and for no good reason.   If Teela has a big part, then so what? Why does this matter? How about we not judge and we just wait and see?    Also, people are just flinging the word woke around without even knowing what it means. Jeez, woke means you are educated, thoughtful and are aware of injustice and social issues, that is not a bad thing it is called being a decent human being.   This show looks good. Everyone needs to get off their keyboards, stop being negative and go outside (granted I am currently typing on my keyboard, but the overall message is there).
If they wanted a strong female lead with He Man, why not She Ra?
It really sucks that it will have a gay centralized focus like She-Ra
I like anime but come on, it doesn’t have to be the root of all animation styles, go back to the original funimation look with some modern flair....
I hope Kevin Smith doesn't ruin this like he does everything else such as his Flash episodes.
Stupid
In the '80s series Adam put on an act of being incompetent. Never saw anything like that in the later incarnations. Also, what did ever happened to the trope that it's the hero that makes the hero and not their powers? Either way, today's shows men are being turned into incompetent background characters. Curious how this one will do that.
Teela: Still know the tune? Adam: Somethings you can never forget! "In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days..."
He-Man deploying some super-physiological doses of exogenous pharmacology
Netflix....KD o trailer em português?????????
I bet 80s Filmation fans never thought that Teela would have bigger biceps than Adam.  The 'woke' era is going to be one of the most ridiculed historical periods of all time, by future generations.
Just a reminder heman is being sidelined for shemam
Kevin Smith lied to us. Another classic turned woke. 🤮
Her: “still know the tune?😏”  Me: “some things you can never forget”  Also me: “ AND I SAID HEYYYEYYEEYE, HEYYYYYEYEEYEYE, I SAID HEY! WHAT’S GOING ON!!
So.....He-man seems to be a side character while woke lesbian i am wah-man Teela is the star?
We all know how this ends: He-man gets humiliated by Teela She saves the day and becomes the new hero of eternia after she come out as a lesbian transgender      At least this is what Kevin Smith wants to do
yup, skipping this one.
The triggered incels in this thread. Aww mommy look they broke my He-Man...aww boo hoo hoo
He/she/ they & the lbgtq transsexuals of the woke universe
Eita poha....nostalgia pura!!!! Fiquei até emocionado quando He- Man soltou sua frase épica, mesmo em inglês!!!!
who was the hipster in 1:00
Why does it look like he-man is being pushed to the side in his own show?it looks like this show is going to be all about teela and her story which probably means it'll be woke and a feminist show ,hope I'm wrong but it's the trend just now
This looks awesome
...oh for fucksake...
Is this the same universe with she-ra?
So is teela a dude now.
Don't make this political, please.
This is trash. Who ever grew up watching 80s He-man. This a complete trash. This look more like a diabolical series. 🤮🖕
By the power of gray skull I am He Man
Alright, even Stinkor and Moss Man are making appearances!  He truly is pulling out every character from the old series.
Man, my Spidey senses are tingling. Why do I feel like this is not going to be about He-man?
I hope they casted Joel for the voice
He looks gay
Best Scenario: He-Man is a sidekick. What will probably happen ? He will be made the bad guy, pathetic and will be trumped and humiliated .
I don't remember the last time I saw comments this salty, based on very little information. He-man was in it a bunch, and he is already a great established hero. My wager is that they are emphasizing someone that can have a character ark, because you couldn't have the same with someone who already had the journey. We all know he-man is a great hero. My assumption they were either going to more heavily emphasize another character to follow that, or a time jump and He-Ma n's child would. Think DBZ with Gohan. Goku is still very much the main character, but we saw other characters take the spotlight from saga to saga, especially his son. And I would absolutely welcome that in this series, there's so many characters.
I'm sorry but all I hear is Joker when Skeletor speaks and laughs. I know it is Mark Hamill, but it still sounds like Joker.
Netflix! God i love Netflix
The Best series Netflix! Lets go
It looks good, crossing my fingers that politics wont be in this show.
Meh
Ficou incrível!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ed boon..... I need a he man fighting game ASAP!!!!!!  And not that stupid button smashing Capcom shit.
Skeletor's laugh doesn't cut it. Original cackle and voice are irreplaceable. A good VO artist should be brought in. Skeletor shouldn't be tinkered with.  Will this also contain She-Ra? A thought.
What the hell? The cat talks?
I see a lot of complaints about He-man not being the main protagonists. So what, he’ll still be in it.  I think it’s cool that they are telling a new story and hopefully, this gives birth to a series MOTU origins. Why not expand the universe and we get to enjoy more of them all. I love He-man and yes, it would’ve been great if he was the main character, but I’m also not going to complain about a new storyline. Let’s just sit back and enjoy the nostalgia
Ohh the animation/drawing style of Young Justice :D cool^^
I predict the first episode will be fan service greatness but the rest of the episodes will be woke AF.
New JoJo is SICK
they simply dropped the name He-man from the title, so expect woke power to the maximum.
Looks like a possible Thundercats remake failure.. Still gonna give it a go like
cool
So, this take is definitely going to explore He-Man as an outlet for toxic masculinity and Adam's insecurities, right? I'm VERY much in.
Maybe the girl narrating is she-she! Hmmmmm
So, Teela knows that Adam is He-man
Hell ya Baby!
Well looks like they removed the He-man from the title.
Cop out to avoid the live action they were supposed to do.
Why is it not called he-man and the masters of the universe? Oh because your not allowed to have a strong male lead these days?
Feel like we was shown a lot of flashback in these trailers
It's not even about He-Man.
Now if they can do Transformers like this I can die happy.
Just make a show for men and boys and stop pushing the fallacy of the strong female character with side shaven head, it is getting old.
Ok guys, now I'm officially hipped... and I don't even have a Netflix account.
Arrepiei que top, nossa que f0d@
Calling it: the end of Kevin Smith's take will involve Adam giving up He-Man.
I saw on reddit QuitYourBullshit that Clownfish TV was bullshitting when they said from their sources that this was a bait and switch and that He-Man was being sidelined for Teela. Turns out they were right and that post should go to AgedLikeMilk.
I hope it won’t be as tolerant as most of Netflix’s films. Or it will become a disaster.
New He-Man: "I. Have. The. Power!!!" Old He-Man: "I am HE-MAN!!!!"
I knew, I suspected, this series is not about the Masters of the Universe, and about Teela, her journey of lesbian discovery, and getting a black lesbian girlfriend to be more inclusive. Prince Adam is an IDIOT, WEAK AND USELESS without his sword, the He-Man will be destroyed because it represents toxic masculinity, and a new She-Man will take over.   I already knew that it would have sealing is a series of Netflix, which I did not imagine and that they would destroy the masters of the universe and He-Man to pass their political/ideological message that all men are bad, and that any relationship that is not Gay and bad. And that no matter your crimes, if you are a woman you can always be forgiven, and evil is relative, unless you are a male, white and straight because YOU will always be evil!
Showwwwww.
So it’s not the he man show then 😢
All the same little people with their same little cookie cutter complaints about "wokeness" or "ruining my childhood", giving absolutely no thought to how the formula that worked 35 years ago, in a bunch of self contained 20 minute kid shows, just isn't going to work in a story driven multi-episode arc geared towards an audience that have (supposedly) become adults.
And so I wake in the morning and step outside...
I’m confused Is this teela show?
Well, I hope it turns out better than this trailer comes across.  The differences between the first and second trailer look like a bait and switch.  And what's with Teela's haircut?
Prepare for trash.  You know this people it's Netflix they run on the same ideology and 3 basic plot lines.  No creativity allowed.
Ouuuuuuu😀
If this is even slightly less gay than shera, I will be very disapointed
Even this trailer has more animation than Record of Ragnarok.
$50 teela will say something along the lines of "now /i/ have the power
Without that legendary BGMs, this he-man series is zero-man series
Masters of the Universe: Revelation. He-Man is not included.
It just seems a lot of fans are saying to themselves, "I got a bad feeling about this."  Rightfully so.  This trailer feels a lot like Tee-la and the Masters of the Universe instead of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.  Anyone one else notice Tee-La's "The Last of Us 2" arms and new "buff" haircut?
Beastman's pretty thinnnnn!!
Just saw a scene. Teela is now man of arms, then feels “betrayed” by prince Adam for not revealing his secret. It’s her show
thanks for ruining another show
Here is the Malta cross?
It has not been forty years since He Man was on. Cartoon Network had He Man on from 2002 to 2004
And I say, heyyeahyeahyeahyeah
"Not destroyed.....diversified"
Cercei ?
Here's hoping for Some seriously funny Skeletor humor to break up the seriousness.
Wow
SHE - man  And the feminizm od the ... Bla bla bla  Netflix
I'm very anxious
Please please please don't make it 12FPS like Catlevania and Blood of Zeus.
Hmm would I prefer seeing women kick ass or big muscley semi naked men 🤔  Bring on the women 👍😀
Yessssss!!!!!!
It is super-misogynistic to depict that women have to be muscular and androgynous to succeed.  It is also anti-science.  The 80s show portrayed women as legitimately feminine (which is what nature wants).
Petition for Netflix to bring hot weels acceleracers
This looks like absolute sh*t.
I mean, Teela has half the sword sooo. 🙄
I He- man find his Sister   i hope so
Cersei?
0:56 this is like God of war 4 end scene xd
Ooh no! Cry the little bitch fan boys looking over their toy collections and wishing for a testosterone driving yarn of old. What are we going to do???? If they're too many girls in it I'm going home to play with my muscle men in loin cloths and dream of simpler times. This show looks amazing.
Ok, who is the son of a bitch that desliked it?
Awesome! He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is back...and respecting it's 80s Origins! 💪👍
Please don't turn this into an SJW Tela girl power show
Rename it to Teela's Joerney.
Total garbage
Where is Classic Theme? 🤔 I am eager to hear new version of classic song....
I want a guarantee from Mattel, Netflix, and Kevin Smith that this show will NOT abuse the characters. No Mary Sue Teela, no He-Man bad/Faker good, no replacing Man-At-Arms, no "men evil", and the secret of Adam not used as a sin.  Can they fully guarantee this?  But, i would like to see Teela becoming the Sorceress she was born to be. Yet, do it in Filmation and ~2002 story line, and must include She-Ra. I am tired of this hate coming to thw 1980s characters (even we are seeing this in Lord of the Rings now) that we have been seeing (Marvel, Disney, Amazon, DC, Image, AT&T, Dreamworks, netflix, sony, cnn, etc. No political agendas, especially from the left.
Looks like DC animation
"Teelor and the Masters of the Diverse"
Yay, Fisto
Why do they keep using this animation style? it's horrible
ok I'm excited :I
if true and we lose heman in the first few episodes ill be pissed i dont even remeber teela?
Why does Skeletor sound more like Mumm-ra?
I don’t care about what all the haters have to say, this looks like a great time! <Born in 1982>
Me gusta!
🤢🤮
What woke garbage is this!
Don't know boys, it's starting to look weird
I like Königsberger Klopse and that’s why i like tri-Klops!!
Suck, suck! thundercats
Why is there such a focus on that female? He-Man was always the focus on the Master of the universe cartoon what fuckery is this!
Fckin sidecut!
Better we have a  He-Man or else no more money for Netflix !
I am trap-jaw!!
Finally, bad guys will be able to do bad things.
Not watching this garbage
Yeesh, I thought Star Wars fans were toxic.
Everyone in the comments: Teela this, Adam that, blah blah blah Me, a Skeletor fan: What the hell was that laugh?????? (01:39)
Malayali undooo
He man
Just say He-Man 🙄
Childhood memories are back
I have o poder!
so teela is now an angry feminist with shaved hair on the side of her head?
He Man is back and he wont be a side kick for teela. He wont die. Cuz if these two things happen every 80s kid will turn their backs on this show.
I will buy every action figure if released lol 80s energy overload 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The sword of power is divided, so that Teela will take half of it and be an equal heroine. More equal than He-man.
This has NOTHNG to do with Filmation's He-Man AND the Masters of the Universe.  He-Man isnt wearing the cross, Teela looks and acts completely of character and prince Adam IS NOT A BOY!  F your sequel to the reboot disguised as "faithful sequel to the original".  And you really had to race and sexuality swap Andra? Are you stupid or something?  Thats not her then! Oh and F YOU Kevin!
I never had hope for this series, then the first trailer hit and i that hold on maybe they will give He-man a bit of respect, and then this trailer drops and all hope is lost again  *Edit I was right, I was right
He man? This looks or like Teela... 😕
Now I have have go back and re-watch all the He-Man episodes from childhood.
Okay, this trailer has me somewhat worried now.. loved the first trailer but please don't ruin He-Man... don't turn him into a simp.
did they actually incorporate  stinker OMG!
Get ready for the bait and switch and yet another humiliation and emasculation of a classically masculine character.
So there are 2 swords now?
90's kids knows this
If this goes woke, I won't watch it...
Wack
🎶 I said hey..... 🎶 whats going on 🎶
It's crazy when  in the 80's I used said by The Power of GreySkull, and still waiting for the power to come in lol  So excited it looks so refreshing
I hope Kevin Smith doesnt F it up with sjw crap.
Pity shera didn't include he-man but this looks awesome.
What happened to magic? Blame those guys and gals from the Magicians tv show 😅
He-man is becoming She-man. Thanks Kevin.
The next level Thundercats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is this She-Man and the Masters of the wokeverse?
Holy 💩!!!!
Castlevania style animation, SOLD!!!
I grew up watching He-Man as a kid now I’m in my mid 40s looks like I’m watching it all over again !!
I have the powaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Netflix: Brings back He-Man Skeletor: "wat?"
If only Man-at-arms hadn't left to buy milk.
Adam looks so week
Teela is multi-dimensional! At one angle she sports a Karen-doo; at another, a shaven Woke-doo. Since Kevin lied and she is taking over the show, let’s hope the well worn cliche works this time.
this is to clean
Funny how 99% of comments are not exactly positive, yet upvotes are like 10x the downvotes. Please bring back the original theme, not this soulless music
Both my parents *were* He Man fans and when I showed them this, they said ‘This isn’t He Man, it’s She Man’ which we already had so In sure I speak for everyone, apart from woke goblins, when I say that the Teela show will underperform which is why they budget was lowered as they knew it would be a flop. Don’t believe the budget was cut because it looks incredible, then tell me why there are only 5 episodes that are 21 mins long?
"i got a bad feeling about this".
Netflix build a time machine for our 90s ❤️.  Thank you
So ready for this.
The creators of this show need to be aware of one thing. The focus needs to be on He-Man and him kicking butt. Teela and everyone else are secondary. If they've lost sight of this fact, this show isn't going to be worth watching.
Already marking my calendar 📆, gather snacks 🍕🌭🍫🍩, drinks 🥤 🍺, merchandise, upgrade my audio speaker 🔊, for the day!!!! Me and my twin brother super EXCITED 😆!!!! Some people called us Adam and Adora. My brother name is Adam, but my name is Eve. And we’re dress up our heman and SheRa costumes.
Fantastico, Eternia da lontano è spettacolare!!!
Huh I made vomit after watching shit shit cartoon. Old cartoon is 100 more far more better than this cartoon
He man would literally snap teelas neck like a chickens no contest.
This won’t even be about He man you wait and see
Where in the hell is BONNIE TYLER!
Looks like it the Teela show after all 😠
I’m so excited! My kids will know great cartoons!
Nice bought upvotes Netflix, you know very well people downvoted  it more than actually upvoted.
More woke / feminist thrash. Definitely not watching, thanks to this trailer.
The original Tyla is a real beauty..this is just a cartoonish clone... Looks far far away from the real MOTU quality even they used new tools...
I am not going to watch if He-man is a side character.
This is that old of my life, as I dont remember other than the He-Man and Skylter... Yayyy Dont bother with the spelling of Skylter...
Reallife better this stuff wak
okay wow $klsounds
Teela looks like a very HANDSOME woman 😆
Oh good... Another franchise going to hell...
Imagine drawing a woman as if she were a man. Gross.
Netflix is on fire with great animation serieses...amazing.
He-man with feminism. Trust me, Kevin Smith is s sellout to the identitarians and the rabid twitter mob.
Take a drink every time an angry bitter nerd uses the word "WOKE"!
I doubt ill watch it but glad Kevin got something so iconic
This is not looking good. First trailer was much better. Why does teela look like the main character?
Woke feminism girl power garbage. What a shame!
And the better part is that He-Man transforms like Sailor Moon
O nível da animação está sensacional
Hmmm so another woke foray into my '80s childhood smh. I bet you that it's going to be all about tela and that new chick. Girl power and all that jazz. Most of the man will be either regulated to secondary characters including He-Man or 2 minute cameo then they're out. I like Kevin Smith and a lot of the stuff he's done so I hope that's not the case but from the trailer alone that's the vibe I'm getting. Oh well what are you going to do right.
1:32  Looks like the Shaping Staff from the original series.
i hear mark hamill's voice lol. he cant only do a joker impression for all his animations...
Atleast it looks nice
The best reboot was on the cartoon network 2002 to 2004
Where is the tiger ?
So... It's about Teela (the most boring, weak and pointless character of the show) and without the original theme (or at least a remake of it). Yes indeed. The magic is gone...
Finally revealing the truth, the main character was never going to be He-Man. This is another woke piece with lgbtq+ theme
Disrespect to the classic He-man series Kevin Smith loses all cool points
It's called MASTERS of The Universe. Not He-Man & The Masters of The Universe. I think a series with such a diverse and colorful cast of characters both good and evil has the right to tell a story that isn't solely focused on He-Man...  Not that you'd think that'd be allowed with how uptight purists can be over this.
Somethings you never forget 😎
👍🏻
Man, again with the wokeness. Female lead, He-man being the bad (white) guy. This is gonna bomb. When will they learn. . . .
Ridiculous it being all about Telia.  It's supposed to be about HE-MAN.
Boys and Girls are not the same no matter how much you want it to be true. You don't go to a animal and say hey your not doing it right. This social experiment where women are strong and warriors needs to end, stop messing with nature.
ThunderCats Next 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The animation looks great BUT I am not liking He-ela (Teela’s) new look. I have a very, VERY bad feeling about this show because of the times it is being produced in and it being a Netflix thing. If the rumors of this MOTU being woke garbage are true, we fans WILL rebel.
Dry Tampons Dry Tampons Dry Tampons Dry Tampons inside women that can be just as strong as men. 🙄
1:52 "Some things you can never forget" 🔥
Hey Netflix can you reboot Conan the barbarian
ഗ്രെസ്‌ക്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി 🔥
That evil laugh😂🤣
Was looking forward to watching this, but now it looks like He-man will be a side character. And that's kind of the whole reason I wanted to watch this. To get something like the original and watch he-man go on adventure's yet again. But now it looks like the generic strong female character will be the main character and probably shit in He-man. Disappointing.
I hope the show remains to be interesting despite how different it is than everyone initially thought
So this trailer proves Kevin Smith was full shit and ClownfishTV called out his lies🙄
Garbage. Hard pass. Sticking to anime.
Uff, childhood days are back ❤❤❤
This looks off the charts 👌🏻👌🏻Stiffy activated 😊😂
not gonna lie, i was really hoping they'd get the voice of skullmageddon from double dragon neon to play skeletor
Nooooooooooo ! Now they done made my fav show as a kid woke trash 🤬 I knew they’d do that bs
I´m confused...Teela gets angry since she was lied to so she cuts of her hair and loses her fashion sense...BUT than she knows about a phrase she never heard before since this phrase was the secret they didn't told her? That makes no sense - the plot and her new look.
All I know He-man better not be drinking soy latte estrogen diet in this new series.
Hmmm...  Will some woke somebody... "cancel" this too..  After all his name is, (dare I say it HE MAN) We shall see
If this is bait and switch, Netflix - I hope you'll lose a lot of money.
If you f this up by making if she-man or feminist I'm going to drop Netflix
വിജയത്തിന്റെ പോരാളി...... ഹീമാൻ...🔥🔥🔥
Heaaaaayeayeayeay heaaaeyayaey i said hey whats going on
I'm so there
They should have gotten Christopher McCulloch to voice Skeletor.
Kevin smiths wifes bf makes sure kevin pees sitting down. What a simp!
They will likely disrespect HeMan with their woke madness.  But I hope at least Skeletor is his old hilarious self.
So dark, are you sure this isn't part of the DC universe?
History repeat ha
MATIAS????
Wow burnt diaper.. heman vs 80lb feminist. I am rooting for skeletor.
Where is Orko my hero
It’s ‘The rise of skywalkerisation ‘ of HeMan
Where's the cat?
Waiting
Miss you he-man I am 37yrs old my childhood best series ever ❤️❤️❤️ u
Да как ЗАТРАХАЛИ ЭТИ феминистки  НЕТФЛИКС зделай пожалуста НОРМАЛЬНЫЙ ПЕРЕЗАПУСК!!!  СУКА! СУКА!! СУУУКААААААААА!!!
She-man and the masters of the universe!
Ah the bait and switch is more obvious in this trailer.
1:50 waiting for that moment🤗
Garbage
Wait did Big Cat literally just speak 😂😂
All the millennials right now HE-MAN!!! I HAVE THE POWERRRR!
I'm gonna rewatch old episodes of He-man, instead of watching this show.
Buenísimoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bad-ass
i'm waiting
This trailer is what  trailers for Last of Us 2  was  btw Skeletor sound so lame  lol
So we're replacing powerful, manly he-man by a bunch of side characters who will probably focus more on talking about LGBT rights than punching villains.
Netflix is going bonkers - evil man Heman - good stronk woman Teela saving eternia. this is destroying legacy of Heman . disgusting
Woke shit = pass.
Teela looks like a lesbian... Where is the cross on the chest of He-Man ? I hope Masters of the Univers is not woke....  if it is, I will boycott !
Grasekul kottaiyin skathiyeee is an emotion!
He-man a secondary character in his own show, kinda like Tchalla in black panther. THERE I SAID IT !
I like the contrast between Adam and He-Man
Heman sounds like a 94 pound teenager
Looks like it’s going to another woke crap. I will pass.
παλι μας πηρες τα μυαλα!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! δε μπορω να περιμενω 20 μερες
Kevin Smith is a liar, and a woke cultist.
What really bothers me is that in a world with no more magic, Prince Adam didn't even think to hit the gym but Teelah did?  Am I the only one that remembers  how in the original series he looked just as jacked as heman but just with more clothes. They even had the same barber.
The sword of power is divided, Prince Adam cannot become He-Man. Teela takes the lead role. Literally He-Man without He-Man.
This looks like woke trash
Nehhehehehehehehehhheheheheh HeMAN
Taking out the main character of the series and replacing him with a side character is extremely toxic.
The amount of toxic fans that are hating on this is infuriating and that’s why this is already my favorite show!
So this is actually a She-Ra series or what?
Well... The show have only two options: He-Man or He-Gay 😁 We shall see soon. Btw. The visuals are amazing. I wish they could bring thundercats with the same vibes too.
I dont understand the appeal of He-Man, I feel its one of those things that people remember from their childhood but dont see now how incredibly bad the 80s cartoon is
дизлайк за негров
I never like he man but I will see this series.plz reboot the thunder cat
This is still not a continuation it's how he wanted it to be done, nothing more than that, definitely disappointing
I remember I passed on the She-Ra reboot when it first came out, but then I dipped a toe and loved it. I'm going to give this a chance, because if nothing else I'm glad the MOTU franchise is making headwinds again.
A woke version of He-man is what we all need
Please don't tell me they're nerfing He-Man.
I'm still biased about the series because of all of the rumors about what Kevin Smith might do to the show are slowly becoming true.
So He-Man isn't the main character? Hard pass on this guess I won't be resubbing to netflix.
I HAVE THE POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Fk yeah Netflix !!!
He-man? More like She-man! Am I right??
So…Kevin Smith lied and Clownfish TV’s sources were right.  It’s bad enough that Smith lied, but he did more than that. He actually attacked someone for *telling the truth*.
I can tell by her haircut this is going to be another woke dumpster fire.
Aww, Skeletor's laugh changed, I don't like that at all, they messed with perfection :(
Wow, thanks Kevin Smith, for gaslighting everyone who were saying you were gonna make He-Man a side character.
Each trailer you can see the bait and switch even more clear lol
Skeletor is just so unbelievably cool ! "The lord of destruction, ha ha ha !"
I've never really watched the old He-Man stuff so I had to look up when folks are complaining about Teela redesign.  Lol, seems folk just want their ridiculous eye candy back.
This looks dope.  I like the fact that it seems they'll be actually building towards something.  As much as I liked the show and the toys in the eighties as a kid, it would get really stale that it was the same plot over and over again, just trying to attack He-Man, but he never really just tried to stop Skelator permanently, only briefly embarrass and repel him.
Kevin Smith "It will be all about He-man!""  Yeah, right
This series will be the big flaw
Alan Oppenheimer, the infamous voice of Skeletor, is doing the voice of Moss Man and NOT Skeletor! I’d almost be mad about it if not for the fact that the great Mark Hamill is voicing Skeletor.
Is that Mark Hamill as Skeletor?
(Gasps)
*Woke Jackals*  are going to destroy this franchise too just like they did to She-Ra and many other franchises from the 80s and 90s.
I wasn't going to watch she-ra because.... cmon its She-ra. But after I did I found how amazing it was. So I'll give he-man the same chance even though in a thousand years Id never think id enjoy something like it.
Da fuq is this!!!
Another thing to add to the 'ruined' list due to wokeness 🤦🏻 Thanks Kev 👍🏻
Please upload in hindi..🙏🙏🙏
Wow another franchise destroyed by feminist ideas!!!
I'm a 50 year old man...and that gave me chills....
Better not turn into He-lost his balls Man
Sorry Heman fans :(
Please skip this show. It's going to be woke garbage.
Oh man looks like it's going to be woke of course netflix..
By the new teaser, without creating controversy, I have a theory: Teela loses her father in battle against King Hiss, she takes his place, as an engineer rejects magic, but the world turns, especially the Eternian... she will end up discovering Grayskull's secrets, in the meantime he'll find half the sword, becoming Tella-Man, uniting science and magic. With these powers she defeats Esquelegod and becomes Tella-Sorceress, ah, turns green at that moment, a reference to the mini-comics. In season 2 she goes to Etheria, discovers she is Hordak's adopted daughter, adopted twice, rebels and becomes Teela-Ra!!1 ending her life in the Crystal Castle, of course, after marrying Adam, who reappears now , in the last episode. In the third he goes to 3 world, and, in a crossover, he takes Lion's place and defeats Mumm-ra... I stop there, I don't want to get into conjectures.
Thanks for this ❤️
You know what the sjws would love? Let's ignore the main character and make the most annoying bratty shit head the main character. Let's have her have hurt feelings to because... okay who the fuxk would actually be bothered by someone not telling you they're superman come on.
Doido d+. Bem violento. Diferente do antigo. Rola fazer um caverna do dragão + violento tb hein🤘🤘🤘👍👍👍
Is she fighting he-man? He-man who is undefeated, undefeatable, lifted castle grayskull?
I used to watch this show 35 years ago as a kid and I'm glad it's going to be different
So many angry 'fans' that are whining and bitching that there's a woman in it and that it might focus on her. All whining about wokeness.
Upvote if you think the 1983 Teela was MUCH more attractively drawn than the muscular, shaved-head 2021 Teela.
I really want this to be good. I really _really_ want this to be good.
Take heed, Netflix: A szenario, in which Skeletor is the victor over the forces of Eternia, even if only temporarily, has been done before in the live action movie. If this is something similar, this will get you minus points in the creativity department. Skeletor becoming a god? Same story in the live action movie.  Also riddle me this: Why do your "strong women" all need muscle tone like men? They didn't need that in the original series, why do you? Given, Teela is only half as buff as He-Man, but she shouldn't even have all that muscle tone. Being the daughter of Man-at-Arms, she should rely on her agility, speed and wits instead of brute strength due to her training. In the original series she is teaching Prince Adam Martial Arts, here she doesn't look like someone fighting with wits, but pure strength. Bah!  Seemingly there is this "Division" crap theme you are playing now in your shows. In Masters of the universe, in the upcoming My Little Pony show. Don't think people don't notice certain similarities.
To all the crybabys, the show is called Masters of the Universe, not He-Man's solo adventures.
Where's Orco?
he man looks ok, but why in an advanced society will they use magic swords wtf... just use guns.
He man feels like a side character now lmao
Ляяяяяя, какая же дикая дичь из мешанины тупой крутизны.... Надо заправить тёмным пивом 👍
Awsome. So hyped. But now i will be watching it with my kids.
If whats rumored end up being true i hope this destroys Kevin Smiths career
Somethings you could never forget  "I have the powerrrrrr.... "❤️
God the comments here are just vile, aren't they?  I'm excited for this.
This looks amazing, yet infuriating lol
Every single mid-forty`s  male person will watch this for sure!
All we wanted was some classic He-Man, what we'll get is a woke Teela show fighting against toxic masculine patriarchy. A white man as a hero? Not on their watch. Teela will probably be a lesbian too.
The animation is really great. I like everything except the music. The music is really annoying. The old soundtrack should have been modified. Unfortunately, this metal soundtrack has no soul and no recognition value
It looks like it's gonna be another SJW trash. I am gonna wait for the reviews.
What a piece of woke💩
Omg I can’t wait seriously giving me my childhood back
I bet Netflix fucks it up with wokeness.
YAWN!
Teela...."by the powuh of gheyskull.....I am empowuhed ""  .....🎶she...maam🎶
Please make Avatar the Last Airbender
I see Teela going Lesbian
Well, I'm gonna go watch the 2002 cartoon now. At least I know what I'm buying with that one.
Why he-man transforming like sailor moon???
He-Maam the series.
He-man is a gay n his partner is a lesbian... Netflix logic.
As much as I despise being deceived by the first trailer, I am willing to give this show a chance just because the premise is interesting: The sword, The importance of their magical resource, and Skeletor being more of a sinister terrorist than a snickering terrorizer
Smells like woke.
Just seeing a bunch of fragile bros upset that their toy commercial has dialogue read by a woman. Can’t believe the crap some of you people will bitch about.
Woke shit.
A love story about Teela and her girlfriend.  Because everything must now be f-_a:g:g-_e-d up.
put it in my veins!!!!!!! I'm all over it
Why does it seem that Teela is the main focus here?
Bunch Haterade drinking incels in here. Have y'all even seen a lady before you nerds?
i didn't like his sword....
I hope this fills the void that castlevania has made. 😐
Another one down the chopping block
My favourite childhood superhero..always wanted to become one. When I grow up I realised that there are no superheroes ..but Doctors are real superheroes comes with power and responsibilities.
It sad when 2021 animation is inferior to 1983 animation.  And that is even before they chose to make women appear as muscular, androgynous brutes in this 2021 version.
It is super-misogynistic to depict that women have to be muscular and androgynous to succeed.  The 80s show portrayed women as legitimately feminine (which is what nature wants).
Trailer look awesome...I am the power ...He-Man
Teela is so pretty and sexy <3
"Still remember the tune?"  "AND SO I CRY SOMETIMES WHEN I'M LYING IN BED!"
what is this type of Animation called
Looks like another woke SJW attempt at destroying a classic. Netflix will succeed at that!!
Some things you can never forget. Memories.
woke trash
First teaser: Hey, that might be good. This trailer: Yeaah, better wait for the reviews.
Is Teela a relative of Abby from TLOU2
A lot of people seem upset that He-Man loses the sword and becomes a side character but I don’t really care. I’m more upset that Orko or whatever his name is might be a prominent character.
After all the blunders with the ideologically infested remakes... I will withhold any enthusiasm until it actually launches. Fortunately, I learned long time ago not to trust trailers.
I can't wait for this!
So everyone is up in arms because of these two trailers, and already have an opinion on a show that hasn't even been released yet
this entire comment section is getting filled with basement-dwelling incels who are whining about a shitty 80s cartoon that no adult can actually watch and enjoy today. there's a thing called storytelling in modern cartoons, not just unrelenting 30 minute ads for action figures. when did people start hating teela so much? and Prince Adam is still there, he just cant access his shapeshifting power, which is literally the plot. the team has to be reassembled to bring back he-man so that he can save eternia. its still HIS story. if you wanna watch the same shit again and again, just watch the old show.
This is not The He Man we know. This is Karens Man
Better not be a woke series 😡
First trailer was better lol
Where is my tiger 🐅
Teela will "come out" as She-man. 😂😂😂
Hatchet-faced side-shaved Teela looks horrible.  The original Teela was a beloved character and, personally, I would have enjoyed a spin-off series focusing on her adventures.  But this isn't Teela.
Teela and its girlfriend vs the oppressive patriarchy.  F*ck you Kevin Smith.
I hear Cersei from GoT 🤔
Happy to see fisto is in there ✊🏻
Good animation wasted on a bad story. Let’s see what happens.
This going to be feminist shit. It's not about He-man. F**k you Netflix. I am done with you.
Dc comics Heman omnibus is the best. It’s super dark. Has great moments and lots of characters dying. Now that is a Heman done right.  Killing of Heman in this show will be an act of mercy. Instead of having him pushed around by Teela and the crew. Better to turn evil Heman and Perish than live like a buffoon sidekick. Let’s e see what the woke masters have planned for our Heman.
GÖLGELERIN GÜCÜ ADINA GÜÇ BENDE ARTIK!!!!!!!!!!!! HE-MAN :-)))))
This is Netflix. I predict that at some point this series takes a sharp left turn following American entertainment's prevailing ideology.
Hopefully, someone's going to be gay in this.
I think it's going to be a woak show
BAIT AND SWITCH
Tell me this doesn't have identity politics at all
😭 Like SSSoooo EPiC!!!!!
Yeah.... it was good when I was a kid... 😑
He-man  master of universe
I HAVE THE POWER!...
Please don't do He-man dirty
Rapaz, gostei muito dessa animação, ficou muito legal, espero que fique muito melhor já que tá na netflix.
Netflix Castlevania, the strongest warrior is Sypha, Netflix Master of the Universe, the strongest warrior is manly Teela. Feminist power? What's happening? 😂
Fingers crossed She-Ra shows up at some point.
Is this Teela and The Masters of the Universe?
The new main character is pretty cool. It’s about time he man is side lined by a strong independent, brave and stunning woman.  Better rename the show to something like she-roars
Just remember how outraged Kevin Smith was when he denied Clownfish TV's rumored plot.  Anyone?
This looks dope
As long as He-Man gets both halfs of the sword in the end we are good.
Why does Teela look like an ugly feminist?
I'm just going to Head Canon that these are the First Ones & therefore a prequel to Noelle Stevenson's "She-Ra & the Princesses of Power"
Teela? Everyone else looks almost the same. But she looks like a dude now. Why? =[
This will be a feminist show
I hate you Netflix. You ruin everything you touch.
The Adventures of HE-MAN and Woke-Girl!
Place your bets. The unlimited power of he-man in an evil form is gonna get destroyed by a stunning and brave female using nothing but her own powerful, raw strength.
Oh this show seems good, (bad timmng because all the forced female roles on media) BUT the original series is heavy weighted on Teela, she is the REAL Daugther of Sorceress and she had to erase her memories. If you dont remember this, then maybe you are too young at 40 XD Also Beastman helping the heroes! Sign me in! Let give this a try people.
He-man and the Masters of the... Ups sorry, I made a mistake..Teela and the Masters of the Universe
I'll be honest:  Certain aspects of this trailer look good, such as the art/animation and the narration/world-building  BUT He-Man is shown turning evil and Teela is shown acting like an edgy SJW.... WHAT!? I am getting mixed signals here, which makes me suspicious of this show's narrative and thus it's intention. I DO NOT want another virtue-signalling retcon of my childhood, so Netflix: Do not disappoint me~
My Childhood day is returning Thanks to Netflix . But Adam in 2nd reboot of He-Man was far better than this Adam. And Why the hell this adam is looking like she-Man?
Why would Kevin Spacy lie about something and bring out YouTubers for stating the truth about the story?  What were he trying to hide; it doesn't even matter because it was later revealed. So, the reason to lie never existed.
All these children acting like they know about He-man lol
I really hope this is not Teela centric woke...
Hard pass
This looks like woke crap. Hard pass
this looks so good  its epic
Where is He-Man Tiger??? I was waiting for this entry too😔
Cant wait to see how destructive could Kevvy SoyMith make to my beloved he-man? Like RJ did to my beloved SW......
BAIT AND SWITCH 👎
Bait and switch woke garbage. No thanks. People are starting to catch onto this shit.
Part of me was hoping they would use the same animation style as the She-Ra Netflix series so we may have a crossover. But this still looks epic.
A word in fairness to so many, many comments here:  The title doesn't say He-Man at all, it's a Masters of the Universe series, so he's just one of the protagonists (probably second), not the main one. There's no law saying he has to be. Stop it with the "his show" complaints.
Not gotta lie "I HAVE THE POWEEEEER!" gaved me chills.
Thundercats and SliverHawks are on the horizon I’m guessing?
Did I just see beast man in the he man camp??? Waiting eagerly to find out….
Cersei on the narrative
Well hello Queen Cersei, survived and got transported to another universe, did you?
Go Woke Go Broke.
Is Teela a transwoman?
For these people who live in their 30s and 50s, every strong woman has to be masculine and lesbian .... they still don't know that we live in the 21st century. I hope they don't ruin HE-MAN but my hope is already diminishing every time that something comes out of this series ...😢👎👎👎
"I have the power?"
looks amazing, but wtf did they do to Teela's design.  blech.
Teela: And the Beta-men of the Universe...
cercie lanister
le voy a dar una oportunidad, por nostalgia
Ah! That what I needed to heal my eyes and ears after watching that Q-FORCE abomination trailer. Thumbs up and keep it up!
Rumor is a bait and switch for woke garbage? That would be heartbreaking, but Netflix's MO
Where is He MAN?
I guess nobody noticed at 50 seconds that there is a multiverse of He-mans. Except for Adam. Even looks like Conan the barbarian inspired he-man made the cute. I hope space He-man is in there. I hated the show, but I would like them to make that version of He-man cool too since the show is canon.
30 seconds in we have heard two women and no HE MAN
Aww, man. The first trailer looked so good, too. Aah well, at least this one saves me the time of watching the disappointing show.
Oh great, Cersei Lannister failed at ruling the Iron throne so now's she's having a bash at ruling Eternia.
I watched the heck out of She-Ra, so I'm watching the heck out of this, too.
the story good but the animation bad
Netflix...you BETTER NOT mess this up!
I am confused is this a movie or a serie???
They stole He-Man's cross pattée!
Kevin smith better apologize to clownfish tv
Another Bait and Switch,  the only good this is we know how this Series is gonna start and how is goin to end...    I´m out 😒
Relembrando a infância!🥺🥺🥺🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
aaaahh i member
Hoping the rumors about it being another woke garbage are wrong, but turning teela into another "stronk wahmen" caricature isn't looking good...
Better this series to be about He-man and the action and not another feminist lesbian empowered with the same hair cut
Netflix killed another one from our childhood :(
Am I the only one thinking that Teela is better off not cutting her long hair because she’s way more beautiful like that than her new hair style.
So many Mad Max: Fury Road, vibes from this...  Teela is the next Furiosa... Im sure at some point she gets the hair cut...
First trailer was awesome, but this one not. I wanna see He-man, not the Eternia's cultural revolution. Didn't remember leftism coming to Eternia. If they release a new version of Conan, sure they would include leftism in the ancient/medieval mithic age.  The show even can be called He-Man, and where is the crucifix in his chest?
She-man, bruh. I hope after this woke garbage you make a new  dota and Castlevania seasons.
Get Woke Go Broke.
Revelation: Eternia has Non-Binary bathrooms and Teela will not use the ladies...
He Man Sunday On Doordashan 90s Kid😌
Looks fun!
OH MY GOD 1:03     YOU CAN *TALK*
So who is the star of this show?
Looking very good so far !!
Super hyped to watch this. I don't remember much of He-Man so to see this being reanimated is gonna be sweet. After watching Castlevania, I have high hopes for this
Netflix: Remember the tune?  Don't even tried to bring a remastered remix of the old song...  This show will be soooooo lame... Skeletor looks pathetic and Adam malnourished.
HeeeeMAN
GOD i hate it when I'm right...Remember the days that there was pretty much only 1 strong female character in this series? NOT ANY MORE, now we have other strong female characters which will probably overshadow He-Man, ah GOD.
so let me guess, the sword of power was "divided" and it will turn out, now they need two heroes, because Adam wasnt enough, and Teela will get a piece of the sword and get her own transformation, because women can do everything a man does, is that the plot? I hope not
Bruh why Teel so angry. She looks like a bully. Why she hates magic? Wasn't she supposed to be the next sorceress like her Mother? Also they make all the women look the same. I though they want to be different from filmation because people were complaining they had the same structure. They are doing the same as them lol. Another thing, what happened to equality where both Teela and Adam fight together to defeat evil instead of each other and make one person be better than the other to defeat evil?!
Warum weint ihr wieder rum bevor ihr nur eine Episode gesehen habt? Meine Fresse seid ihr langweilig....und sowas nennt sich Fan🤨
How is it that the “I have the power” part was better on the original series?  I hope they bring the old theme music back for part of it too.
Netflix presents?  Tells me everything right there.   Wont be seeng this woke version.
meh i go back and look the original 80´s he-man. the one and only you need to see
This will hold me over until “Blood of Zeus” comes back  It’d be even better if they made He-Man an Xbox exclusive game
Que trolazo!!!
Well, Kevin Smith straight up lied I see…
Can't wait! He-man & Thundercats were my childhood favorites!
I thought this was about he man?
Looking great
Anyone else thinking this could be gayer and just want this he man to meet other She-ra?
I'll still watch it. I never thought that a huge, barrel chested, muscular guy in a furry speedo would nearly make  an old man cry
Teela and the Masters of the Universe. By now, I should have seen this coming.
All I wanna kno is will mer-man still sound like he’s gargling water as he speaks
Thats it Buffy give em hell.  She's fantastic & kudos to an underrated Chris Wood. His Adam/He-Man is 👍👍 Cringer talks & Mark Hamill as Skeletor 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 casting. Looking forward to this. Glad they've kept to the original outline of the characters as much as possible but with the advances in animation...For the Power of Grayskull!
We got a she ra reboot and now a he man reboot sort of
Liar Kevin Smith
Gimme!
So who's the lesbian in this one?
Now we are talking!  Thank you NETFLIX ❤️🙇🏻‍♂️
For a show called He-Man, they showed that tall muscular red haired woman an awful lot more than they showed him in the trailer. Is she actually the main character or something? Who is she? I don’t know anything about He-Man at all.
Masters of the Universe: Revelation
The axe the snake
Still remember the old HE-MAN
This is even worse than if Lion-O or G1 Optimus Prime got benched for the franchises they headline. He-Man has always been THE main character of Masters  Of The Universe.  But now Teela is superior to a feminine looking Prince Adam and on par with He-Man.
where's my 90's HE-MAN theme intro ? that's my guy
In fact Teela is the heroine of the show ... I'm afraid that Netflix will make netflix. What a shame...
Deadd
While everyone is losing their collective shit over "wokeness" because of Teela's haircut and larger role in the story (which she was always a prominent character in pretty much all fiction over the years with an important destiny in the franchise), I am marking out for things like: 0:05 the three towers of Eternia 0:49 King Grayskull, Vikor, and He-Ro in the background  1:00 Snake mountain with elements from both the animated series and toys  Looking forward to this.  Not saying it's guaranteed to be good, but I can appreciate the fact that there's elements to the story that were never in the different animated series that are finally coming in to play.
This looks great eventhough the original He-man series is my favorite one.
Cannot wait for this!!!
It's good to know Abby found some new work.
I didn’t know biden was in it
bUt tHe oRiGiNal wAs pErFeCt!  no. It wasn't.  it was good for its time, but it hasn't aged well.  At all.  Take off the rose tinted glasses.  Nostalgia can be a mf'er.  This series looks amazing, just hoping Netflix doesn't cancel it after one season.
Honestly this looks cool and I hope it’s good but I’m not seeing anything new or special but it’s not like anyone is telling us to expect that or anything, I can’t remember any of the actual story, I was too young, but it kinda seems a bit hokey lol 🤷‍♂️ maybe not but this was meant for toddlers I’m not lost or the irony of a lot of 40 year old men excited for this… i mean this is going to be in the kids version of Netflix right? I bet you don’t know for sure do you?
1 lie exposed. Kevin Smith talked about how this was for the fans of the 80s cartoon and it’s a direct continuation of that show. How is that possible when Adam looks like a skinny teenager? He was still muscle bound as Adam in the original. Did he go on a huge diet or starve himself for a year? I like the change but don’t say it’s a continuation. Call it a reboot
🌌🦹🤹
More intersectional feminism, woke ideology GARBAGE!!! Enough! Please!
Is this at all related to the Netflix She-Ra series? Because that show was decent and I kinda want to see more of that continuity.
well i guess He - man will be portrait as a gay character in the later episodes ... everything else would be a surprise ...
i bet all the  movie whatever series  will be this , all the time the dam woman (Teela with a new skin color,yeah because for netflix , white hurt their feeling)   will child HE-Man and correct him in every manner and the show is not about HE-MAN but her  with stupid drama . better go back watch the 80/90
Who else remember Thunder cats
Korean Drama's Telugu dubbing Release 😭😭😭
Looks amazing! Thank you Kevin Smith!
I feel like they're gonna pull a Twin Peaks The Return on He-Man and have him be Prince Adam learning to be a hero without his powers for the majority of the show, and then earn back his He-Man identity by the end of it, and honestly I'm OK with that. That's a fun character arc.
This is gonna be good. People bitching for no reason at all.
Really got goosebumps.........but wait, looks like some new experiments have been done, like He man sword is a little bit slim and it splits in two, As far as I know, Skeletal posses this kind of sword, did Skeletal secretly traded his sword with He-Man.....????? And why his Cat is talking........?????? Whatever I'm still excited to see this new series 😍😍
Just curious of who’s gonna voice Orko (he’s my favorite)
They should have left that dora haircut. It kinda still looks like it tho.
The original evil laugh
So the whole goal of this 'woke' series is to turn Teela from a first-rate girl into a fifth-rate man?  Shouldn't the title of this series be 'She-Man'? It is super-misogynistic to depict that women have to be muscular and androgynous to succeed.  The 80s show portrayed women as legitimately feminine (which is what nature wants).
I have the powerrrrrr
Gracekal kottaiyin Sakthi 🔥
This needed music from the original series
I am stil optimistic about it but lets be carfull about it. Lets just hope it wil be good and not full of Woke shit
80's kids know.. The feel.... He -Man 🔥
From the very first moment the trailer were released, people were speculating this was going to be a bait and switch. I don’t want them to be right... but its looking more like they were right
Such a shame, I was so hyped by this. I still own some He Man toys. Well, fu Netflix (again). :(
The white man still wants to be God
1:42 Orco and evelyn having a truce?
Teela looks like a redheaded Karen!
Don't trust Netflix. They underpay their animators
MOON! PRISM! POOOWEEERRR!!
Somehow I don't think the original show writers would like this very much, far too violent. The show always had a moral lesson, He-Man only used force when absolutely necessary. I guess modern audiences can't like something unless there's gratuitous fighting and s3x. Also, why did they make Teela a dude? Why on Earth would she be fighting against He-Man?  Edit: When I asked "Why did they make Teela a dude?", I meant that they stripped her of femininity. I feel really bad for women, It's sad that to be a strong woman, you must abandon your femininity and take on the traits of a man. Also, that silly haircut is not at all flattering.
I dunno why but I have a feeling tri clops will be quite important this time
Netflix should also reconsider to reboot SWAT KATS, THE REAL AVENTURES OF JONNY QUEST, SILVER HAWKS, THUNDERCATS and BIONIC SIX... Just Saying! =D
Wait is that....Stinkor? They put stinkor in this?
Idk, voice acting is so bad lol
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV and Apology he lied attacked the channel lying about Teela being the main character and He-man being side-lined its true
Just bring back the heman theme music plzz
Here we go.  1. Throws crown on Away 2. Cuts hair really short  3. Fake outrage and fights male .ain't character now sidelined.
Well now I guess I'll dig out the old vhs recordings of He-man because this don't seam to be his show at all.  I am surprised the tune not SHEEEEEEE HAS THE POWER!!!!!!  wokeness strikes again
I love how this trailer is intentionally trolling the butthurt proudboys
Goosebumps
Woke
I say again: He-Man will be the main villain of this series.
At 00:25 Tee-La seems Ken Shiro... sigh
Prepare to get WOKED!
scare golw is there
I only know He-man. Who are the others
i smell the wokeness in the air!!!!
Reading these comments I now I understand that the original MOTU's audience mostly grew up to be insecure incels
All of Hollywood hey she is a strong independent lets make her lesbian. Not a strong women have to be lesbian but Hollywood wants you to think that.
Same boring story than Loki.
Regresa la serie de caguaman
Looks a little woke....
I don't know if I like the lesbian route this is taking...
🤮
By the end, He-man gets cancelled for [REASONS] or reveals he's trans. Just watch. 😆
My body went through several phases watching this and I LOVE IT !!!
bait and switch : yes watch :nope
Story looks excellent, art style passible.. but that janky animation! missing loads of frames.. not at all smooth. APV's Invincible was a similar art style but was smooth enough to be watchable.. this imho is utter jank! ... I mean Invincible was a little janky but watchable.. this ^ .. I can't watch this.
EPIC!!
Getting those strong "Stunning and Brave" vibes.
Why does the hero have to be musculer?
I never watched he-man so i have no nostalgia-goggles on and I must say this looks pretty neat
Taking bets whether it's gonna be ruined by SJW agenda like Castlevania or not.
This is going to be trash. He-man is going to be replaced by Teela. No one is going want to see that.
He's HeMan
We were bait-and-switched.  First trailer released a couple of weeks ago makes you feel that the show will be centered on HeMan.  This new trailer shows that Masters of the Universe will be centered on Teela to appeal to Nazi-feminists who couldn't give 2 craps for this show.  Not interested!
So after 1 episode ,  he man will lose his power because he has to split the sword to restart the magic to save enternia. No he man , evil takes over .. Teela in her new roid bod will have to lead and save eternia , but skeletor joins the sword back together and becomes skelegod.. Orko will probably find away to get the sword back and cringer will take it to adam and heman will return to defeat skelegod ..  So mainly Teela saving the day with her girlfriend🤦.. But heman will be around and back by the end.. Does this sum it up ? Feels like this may be the story in a nutshell
this look bad, forced inclusi...Of course is netflix
Why does He-Man feel like a side character
My childhood hero 😎, but you missed important transformation of😺 " cringer " into fierce battle cat🦁
Just let it die. Leave it be.
I’m just curious where is Battle cat
She-Woman gonna save them all!
KEVIN SMITH LIED.
I think we just need to see what Kevin smith comes up with. It’s three weeks and we will know what he did with it. Teela has always been super powerful and an awesome character In her own right. having Adam lose his powers for a couple episodes and highlighting the other Masters could be really cool. Plus Smith already said he may do a second season if asked.
Masters of the bait n' switch revelations Kevin Smith owes clown fish tv an apology
My childhood memories revived! Thank you Netflix ❤️
He man old tv series of door darshan in 90,,
Provide Hindi Language Also
Somehow I know Netflix will ruin this with some woke BS. You can tell from the trailer HE-MAN isnt even the main character. They even very purposefully didn't include HE-MAN in the title of the show.
So we're getting a Teela show?
Mucho ruido y pocas nueces...
Did anyone notice he mans eyes where red in one clip is he gna be the big bad ?
Please don't be woke. Please don't be woke. Please don't be woke.
I can’t wait!!!! Brings back so many memories of being a kid back in the 80s.
Childhood memories, 90's helll yeaaaah HE-MAN
the cartoon network series and art work is by far the best IMO
hmmmmmmmmmm
I can't just wait for my parents to get tired of Netflix so I can cancel this shit XD
EEEEE Cringer sounds SO CUTE >.< love this new trailer, this shows ramping up to be something def worth watching, cannot wait :3
Kevin smith lied. He Man is taking a back seat to Tela not good. The old bait and switch.
Somehow the skeletor have the vibes of Ainz Ooal Gown
What's going on ?!
I smell a bait & switch.
We get the idea, you ruin the hero, but put some nostalgia to try to inflate your numbers and lie to the upper echelons about how "successful" is your series. Not gonna watch it.
It looks like the rumours where true
Just like I said. He-Man is being sidelined in his own show.
God, that gimme Goosebums
Hype
why is everyone butt hurt about this teela character? She seems badass
I guess "woke" is now the replacement for "SJW" for people to whine and bitch about on the internet. God its pitiful.
Like i know Prince Adam is a normal person until he summons the power but damn they made our boy look like he needs to eat something haha.
I have NO PATIENCE!!!
July 23rd... I'm there. Born in '76, I grew up watching He-Man and She-ra cartoons. Kick skelators ass! Where's the tiger he-man rides? I can't believe Netflix made this! Too cool.
Damn, I’m an old dude who watched He Man as a kid, I had no idea that kids today knew who he is
0:29 Nobody going to mention Jason Mewes blowing green smoke that smells like skunk?
Bait and switch in 3... 2... 1...
Plase also release it on Netflix India. !!
Kevin Smith appears to have roasted fans for telling the truth on this one.... he owes ClownfishTV an apology... he appears to have been spot on.
I cant wait until the reveal where he-man is a black woman.
Love how nerds just want to be angry. This looks freaking awesome!
Hard Pass on Netflix's woke rubbish.
THESE GIRLS ARE BUILT LIKE BRICKS
I suddenly have a the feeling we're not going to have a lot of He-Man in this He-man series.
Yesssssssss
No body can replace the 80s magical he-man series
So after he man loses his magic (mojo) teela going to leave him for a mysterious black women in the trailer.        OK.  🌈
Why didn't they just call it "The Teela series" we all know it's not going to be about He-Man and it's going to be filled with lgbtq...
Another show for Netflix to cancel after two seasons
Art style is super cool.
from the preview, it is a He-man show but focus more about the shaved head person.
why is heman still a guy, shouldnt this be hewoman or something? oh no wait i get it heman becomes evil because white male and some women comes up and is super awesome and perfect in every way comes up and pwns the evil heman. good call netflix cant wait
He-LGBTQ
Ha lezzzzzzz goooooo
Yeah, despite being a fan as a youngster not really feeling the Story of Teela here. Looks like she even gets half of the power sword. Because you know, a man isn't responsible enough to have all the power or something.
My dad watched the 80s version I watched the 90s reboot and now I’ll watch this one 😂❤️
My childhood is back Jack!
Just in He Man transitions to She man.
Man, what an awful look. What happened to the beautyful Style of the Original Series?
My question will always be, why the new "strong female" characters had this same hair style with a shaved side? Is the default selection or what?
Lloro de emoción, Gracias, saludos desde Perú
I have a friend that is deeply disappointed by this series, and it isn't even out yet. As for myself, I'm ambivalent.
Soy i-van y soy un trollasooooo
Did anyone get Last of us 2 vibes? Heard this weeks ago about the show going woke.
He-Man: "I have the POWER!" Skeletor: "I have CRAPPED my pants!"  XD
Why did they make Teela a lesbian with an ugly haircut?
I don't have a problem with the premise of Teela being the one who "brings the band back together" so to speak. But those seems to be too little He-Man in this trailer. Still looks cool overall but slight concern. Also, I am okay with her muscle but I would have done something other than the stereotypical college student protester haircut.
Looks awesome but is this going to end up being the teela show?
This looks like it will be a bad ass show...but I what I am hoping is that it does well enough that we will finally get a season 2 thundercat 2011.  Hear me out: she-ra proved that story driven shows based of 80's properties can work and are wanted, so this show was greenlit. You know what other show was widely popular along side the original he-man? Thundercats. If this does well, netflix might ask cartoon network for the rights to produce a 2nd season of thundercats 2011.
1:52 going to cry
Too bad he won't be called as He-Man. The woke society will never allow it.
Where is the theme song of this series  What happened to the original armour of he man   Anyways Thank you @netflix in billions for getting our childhood back
Damn, people, can we at least SEE THE DAMN MOVIE before we’re certain it sucks??  I’m a little psyched at a more mature themed He-Man cartoon myself.  If it’s about Teela, then it’s about Teela. Stfw?  The producers knew who the audience was coming to see.
This made my child hood best , I will let my children see what were those days like.
Oh no. I hope those haters aren’t right….fingers crossed
I heard that the focus won’t even be He-man himself, but Teela.  Im gonna really disappointed if they do a bait and switch like this.  Just rename the show “Teela” and don’t try to trick viewers with a brand name because you don’t believe in your own products.
Where is hordak?
@kevinsmith is giving us what we want🤯🤯🤯
Wow.. politicizing He man..lol. The ccp and the democrats have lost their mind.. I can't wait for the audit to finish up so the arrest can start.. It is interesting watching the lefties panic though...  God Bless America! Happy 4th weekend
Kabali is back
So this is "Intersectional Feminism and the Masters of the Universe"?  Got it.
Tela is the main character not He Man wtf but I will give it a chance only because Kevin Smith has his hands in it
cant waaait.............
Amazing
Feminism is untire, his mission is total destruction of the males icons in pop culture!
He-Man: Fury Road, but not good.
So, more than a decade waiting for a new HE-Man show just for him to be sidelined. Thanks for nothing Netflix.
Dear Netflix, you needn't sideline male characters in their own series to seem progressive. In Castlevania we had Sypha, Carmilla's court and other female characters that were important parts of the story. And we loved them. Like we love Trevor and Alucard. You can have great characters, we can have representation (the pair of lesbian lovers) and we can have great villains and heroes. They can be women.  And they can also be men. Don't sideline He-Man on his own damn show. You don't need it to have us love a character. Being truly progressive is stopping giving a damn about gender and focusing on giving us great characters, regardless of who they might be.
Poli sanam
SHISH      ( x , x )''
Where's Orco?  He is the Jar Jar of He MAN
i cry with this series... hope second season allready planed Oo
Interesting that the He-Man never came in the trailer, because as we now, He and Man are banned words now !
This is going to be woke shit
still know the tune? Bruce Wayne: some things you can never forget because I am... Tony Stark: *I am Iron man*
Looks great, sounds horrible! Kevin Smith seems to have done an awful job writing here.
These producers really owe @clownfishtv an apology! How do you smear a group when they said exactly what you are doing with this show! And I actually like Kevin smith but that was uncalled for slander!
I can’t wait for he-man to become a side character in his own show and get educated on woke politics! (Loads gun points to head)
What the f*ck? I want a series about Hee Man, not about the nouname lady
...the cat talks now?
this looks woke....
So Teela is the star?
Someone hire a nutritionist and a personal trainer for Adam.
So they  went from He-man to to what a she -man lol this funny just make your own story from her own back story
I don't exactly trust Kevin Smith...though.....For now!
Question.  Is this a reeboot, or a continuation
So is Teela The Sorceress’ secret daughter in this one too?
How stunning and brave you are Crying Kevin Smith. Very woke of you. And reading the comments I don't believe for a second those 50K upvotes. Cooking the books ?
For those in the comments upset that He-Man has an arc where he has to find the split sword and Teela leaves the Masters of the Universe, you're missing the point. It's a journey of self discovery and realizing that they're more powerful together. It's not called He-Man and the Masters of the Universe anymore because the team is separated for a bit due to a  disagreement on whether or not magic is important. So it seems anyway.
Is He-Man still He-Man or is it She-Man? Two trailers so far and no one has even mentioed the namn He-Man..
Chris Wood supremacy y’all
Masters of Wokeness! Yikes!!!
This looks amazing
Woke Trash.
0:44 That sword holster look terribly impractical.
so should we call it SHE-MAN now for diversity reasons?
0:50… Did you really race swap King Grayskull??? You had other Heman characters to race swap as they never existed in media before. King Grayskull was a direct bloodline descendant to Adam which is why he looked like Heman. Toys and media of him exists. He had a couple full episodes in the cartoon and has a toy of what he looks like. So now he’s AfricanEternian because checkbox?
More bait and switch… adam is a mega loser, heman is sidelined and teela is a man… f@k you
Females of the Wokiverse. Clownfish was right. Crying Kevin Smith betrayed us.
He-man ഞാൻ ചെറുപ്പത്തിൽ കണ്ട cartoon അല്ലെ ഇത് 😅
wait no she-woman? i am disappointed
Giga chad
i know this show is gonna be some woke (white) wahmen are the best bs per usual anda bass turd ization of the IP buuuuut imma watch anyways because SMG is my queen. she was my female teen heart throb and a very talented actress but sadly her record comes to show half the time she picks crappy projects though her performance always shines through a crappy project.
Man. It smells like Comic-Con in here.
Masturbators of the Universe this is the show for you!
You owe Clownfish TV an apology Kevin Smith for smearing them. They called you out and were right about this being the Tela not He-Man show. If you're going to go all woke and crap all over the show so many us us grew up watching you can at least be HONEST about it. Stop trying to bait real fans into watching your woke garbage.
Can Netflix renew "ThunderCats (2011)" series? Millions of fans are waiting for years :'(
*I HAVE THE POWER!*  Really, who was waiting to hear it?
Yoo probably the hardest animation I have watched 🔥🔥🔥
Well it looks ok so far besides he-man having that magical girl transformation
Why did they have to give her the generic STRONGWHAAMEN underside cut that 99% of female heroes have? Why is this a thing I honestly don't understand. Like if it was sone yes okay but in comics movies tv shows its a genetic goto haircut now.
he man copy from thundercats. thundercats copy from visionaries. hahahha.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Can't Wait Can't Wait
She-Man Cucked-Man
Who is the main character He Man or Tila?? Looks like He man is the sidekick of Tila!
The animation looks really good but from the trailer it feels like the story will not be so great.  Eternia was the first planet?  It was created from magic?  If it dies, everything else goes with it?  That all seems stupid to me.  The part about people forgetting about magic and moving on to technology is pretty cool.  But I really loved how the 2002 series built on the lore in a more cohesive way.  I hope this does the same.
No more bowl cut?
more woke BS
Jeremy from geeks and gamers seems correct. This doesn't look like a heros journey, but more of a hodge podge of "diverse" journeys. Oh how I miss classical storytelling in media.
Okay. I went from being excited to probably going to skip this in the space of two minutes. Calling it now. He-man is going to be sidelined in his own show for some GIRL-POWER!!! She gets the half of the sword, becoming... She-Man? Yeah, no. Stop using nostalgia to lure in fans just to jump them a product they did not ask for.
but remember, eternia dies
We warned everyone what would happen. We warned everyone a second, third, fourth time about the toxic that is Kevin Smith AND HIS LIES and well now you have the Woke Wha-Men and the Wokeness of the Universe.  It's utter rubbish and the they've now destroyed He-Man.
So Clownfish TV was right. Kevin owes Clownfish TV an apology.
And of course a man will become strong and powerful thanks to magic (deception) and without it he will be skinny and less than any woman  He will become evil and destroy everything and a strong woman will proudly and pathetically fix everything  At the same time, all women will be cool and strong by themselves , they will look as masculine as possible and not have an open skin-when like a man literally in his underpants
Tamil series audio dubbed plz
by the power of grayskull!!!
He-Man & Skeleton r one of my favourite childhood characters....
He man taking a back seat smfh
Let the woke bait and switch commence.
I feel the hype! I hope they don't screw this up
Have a bad feeling this will turn out to be "She-Male and the Masters of Diversity" in the end..
The voices r terrible 😭 that’s in no way he man
Gee, I wonder if He-man will be possessed then have to get his ass kicked by Teila.
the Teela show?
Beerus: Hakai  Planet: BOOM!!
De pronto ya no me interesa esta serie ya estoy cansado que que metan a huevo cosas raras es simplemente otra historia de alguien más no es continuacion del antiguo canon y no tiene nada que ver con la serie original, ojalá hagan algo diferente después 🤷🏻‍♂️
He man
Woke garbage. Gotcha. I'll stick with the previous reboot. And maybe in a decade when the woke tropes and nonsens have hopefully been dead and buried for a while there'll be a reboot worth bothering with.
This is giving me Deltora quest vibes
Hurmm.. I really don't know whether to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to this trailer 🤨
Iv been waiting a long time for this he-man 💀
Teela this, Teela that- how about the fact they made Battle Cat talk???
F0ck you Kevin Smith All spoilers have been confirmed
He-man with feminist tonality - Netflix's He/She-Man/womanLGBTQ....WTF.
This looks amazing why are the virgins and incels upset?
The show is called Masters of the Universe: Revelations. Not He-Man: Revelations. I like that they are going to seemingly explore having a different main protagonist. Why does Teela as the lead make some of you so mad? Why do so many men hate women?
I know a lot of u dont seem to understand.  When you complain about wokeness, SJW, feminism etc. All normal people hear from you is Mac from Always sunny telling us hes not gay. Stop . Its embarrassing. Get your shit together.
cant wait for the new memes
My body is ready
While this does look lit I aaaaaam wondering why there appears to be more screen time dedicated to random warrior lady than to, you know, He-Man.......
Now i don‘t want a Thundercats Remake from Netflix anymore 😑
childhood days
Oh my! This is looking amazing!
So how many movies/series its gonna take To notice that woke dont sell
Hewoman 💩💩💩
This looks badass.
White boys mad in the comments lmao
heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa what's going on
I miss the original theme music  "he-man and the masters of the universe , he-man he-man" and he utters "by the power of gray skull" nostalgia line which remains my childhood days miss those days 😭
To be fair, the only one you'd go drinking with out of them is Skeletor
Would have felt more awesome..if he man said.... I am the power instead of I have the power.
Netflix really got a serious boner after Amazon released Invincible.
Can't wait to watch this, I still remember I was 8 year old.
There'll probably be lots of really "hilarious" jokes about how He-Man is a muscle bound brute while Teela is the one to save the day.
If He-Man is a non-binary homosexually interested character I’ll never forgive you Netflix never
Man could have sworn he man would be turned into LGBTQ by Netflix🤣
Kevin Smith warned us... Seems that this won't be He-Man's show, but Teela's. Anyway, I kinda like this trailer, and remember that it may be just the part one's... I still got high expectations
Nice that someone brought this comic character back to life. Waiting for  Phantom also to return
Oh dear
So much childhood memories.. can’t wait
I'm liking the new Teela actually. Call me a simp but she's kinda hot for a cartoon.
Doesn't seems like he-man will be the star on his own show
I bet every episode will have a heavy dose of woketastic wokery.
Man this show looks like cheeks 😔
THIS IS SO INSANE!!!!! I can't wait for this
No. Just no. That was the dumbest thing I have ever seen. I will stick to the original. Still the best. This did not need a remake.
Looks dope! Powerhouse animation is on a seriously underrated roll! Seis Manos, Blood of Zeus are both really good and Castlevania is a complete classic!
Really loving all these comments from people who never watched the original show and are only here to push their anti-women agenda. Get over yourselves and stop pretending you were gonna watch a show you never even heard about until your loser youtube creators made up a fake controversy for views.
I am celebrating this so much!!!!!!!!! Childhood is back in a fantastic, magical way!!!! Can't wait for this to be released!!!!!!⚔️🗡️🛡️🎇🌋⚡⚡
Dudeeee, the editing gave me a brain tumour.
I was huge He Manm fan boy as a kid (im 48)....unfortunately, I do not think I will be watching this
So… Clownfish TV was right, then. Why do studios and writers feel the need to lie? Don’t they know the truth will come out eventually?  The animation and everything looks cool, but everything I’ve heard happens does, like the trailer seems to indicate, I’m not sure I want to watch it.
Cheguei a me arrepiar assistindo esse trailer . Muito ansioso pela estreia !
SHE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF HER UNIVERSE. 🙄
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology.
Lying Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology.
this looks amazing
The animation looks great, the story looks cancer. Do better.
Gracekkal kota yude shakthi ennil othungum aa shakthi koodi vaa 💥
Nah they missed a trick on this one
Hahhahahahahhahahajjahahahajajjajajahahajh SHE MAN!!!!!!!!!! OR TEELA!!!!! FEMINISM SUCKS!!!!!
I remember Cringer talking in the original cartoons... But, was he THAT eloquent?
Nope.
Will Teela still become the Sorceress? Does She-Ra still exist in this universe? Is Beastman getting body hair removal treatments?
Thought this was going to be He Man. Not Japanese anime with america cartoon characters. SMH
Why does this look so good?
4.000 stupids
It's He'Ma'am!
Teela and The LGBTs Of The Universe.
Now if they can remake she-ra princess of power the same way that would be amazing!
Teela's new haircut sucks. Its so cringe.
Finally...Stinkor
Me: is this show Will be epic?  The show: it Will be, whennit fits a woman.
Sarah Michelle Gellar is in this, Alicia Silverstone is in this, Lena Headey is  in this, Cree Summer is  in this. Kevin Conroy is in this.  I could keep going on. Essentially, The Voice cast for the show is pretty incredible
Lord of Destruction? Isn't that Diablo?
My whole childhood memories are coming 🥰super excited 😍😍😍 I m the Power ❤️
Looks epic af
Red Flags/predictions: 1. He-man isn’t the main character 2. Skeleton has only appeared in a single scene 3. It’s made by Netflix
*I said HEEEYYYYAHYYAYYEEEEAHH!!!*
So who is the hero here? Not he man.
Lets go To programing cener
"But now, the magic is gone."  My thoughts exactly watching this trailer.  Congratulations, Netflix.  You killed your own show before the first episode even aired.
Old Skeletor became Moss-man...............
He-man transform like sailor moon now ?
Wait... This is a Bait & Switch!   It's not about He-Man.  :(
It's not called "He-man" which means they progressively destroyed it in their vision He Man is probably gay, and that dumbass I wanna be a warrior haircut Teela wears now only looks like Goro from Mortal Kombat!
Teela had better not be the main character in this show. We are here to see He-man, and the other characters are side characters at best. We do not care about Teela's journey if it doesn't include He-Man the entire time.
It's She Ma'am!
Nice...
Wow! a show were the girl looks like "She-Man", because reasons, and te main white man character get sidelined in his own show! How genious, i never seen this before!
He-man 🙄😏👈
Why do I get the feeling from this trailer that He-Man isn't even the main character in his own show now.
Where is tiger ... Yarrr😞😞😞
I love this, after season one can we get the thundercats!
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I was looking forward to this for about 2 1/2 minutes, but it looks like Kevin Smith is going to turn it into "Batwoman : Eternia Edition".   No thanks.
Animation looks great, but AGAIN, another likely stronk wamen bait-n-switch plot.
They should have used the same music and the tone of 'I have the powerrrrr'
Lol.with all the crazy about this I am looking forward to it
HeMan is almost not in the series. Teela is the main char and the new SHEMAN. Thank you NETFLIX for destroying this....
And mark Hammel is skelator
Yeah I'm not gonna watch if skeletor doesn't laugh like he used to.
🔥🔥🔥
I love that the red head cut her hair in rebellion… perfect
The actress who played cerci is the voice of the sorceress
Please release in Hindi
Netflix has officially made Heman the shewoman. Woke fukin up all nostalgia.
me chego a arrepia os cabelo do cu !!!
I don't actually know anything about the He-Man universe, so while this trailer is somewhat helpful, it's still not as hype as "Holding Out For A Hero" made the last one
Teela the main strong character with weak Price Adam following her around, everything else looks cool what a shame!
T : "Still Remember the Tune?" A : "Some things you never forget", "I SAID HEEEIIEEIIEEE E EE, HEEIIEEEIIEE, I SAID HEY! WHATS GOING ON?!?!"
The voice of cersei lannister in beginning ❤️Lena heady
Why not rename this Teela....
Soooo, whatever , what if nobody dies , and we can Take back The time?
The trailer makes he-man look like a backup character in his own show.
It STILL looks amazing even if for a time the show is about Teela. I have faith,... I mean,... THE POWEEERR!!!
I think you spelt the name wrong its Suppose to be Thunder Cats
This reeks of the ol bait and switch. I’ll wait for reviews.
A woke pile of shite
We need to include She-ra, definitelly more She-ra
Am getting Thunder Cat vibes😎
I never got why adam changed back and didn't be heman 24-7?
At least they didn't go woke and make it "She-Man". Update: they did... stupid Kevin Smith.
Is he-man the hero? Or is it the stunning and brave woman narrator?
my childhood!!!!
Ms. Swan 🦢 (while looking at the new Teela): She look like a man 🧐 !"
Ya this is not all about Tela at all. Butched herself up and and is weilding the power of Woke.
I grew up with He-Man this stuff looks great but... the amount of cliche dialog they managed to squeeze into this trailer is about to give me a seizure in 3... 2... 1..
So it's not about He-Man.  K, if you don't want anyone watching your show that's fine by me.
0:23 Wow that girl is cute. I SURE HOPE she's a great female character written well@
-Where is my sister She-ra? -Gone away after 5 seasons. You're on your own
Wa-Men and Masters of the Universe
Marc benardin is an SJW shield carrier
hahah..
So I guess Teela is identifying as a man now?
Does anyone remember that super hero Isis? That's a series I'd like to see return to TV. Hint hint Netflix.
My childhood cartoon He Man
Jokes on you iam into this shit.
What this look great i will be tuning in
Is this about Teela or He-Man? She seemed to be the most highlighted character in the trailer. If so, it won't end well.
Teela: Still remember the tune?  Adam: (Humming the old “He-Man” theme from the 80’s cartoon)…He-Man!!  Teela: 😐
HYPE!
Netflix, be extra careful with this series, y'all walking on thin ice. You better not mess it up!. I see., you split the sword introduced a woman, she will become what ...a "She-woman" (or SHE-RA) now? . Idk how that will unfold. (y'all better be sticking to original storyline and plot). BUT DON'T RUIN THE CLASSIC IN NAME OF DIVERSITY AND STAYING RELEVANT...I RESPECT ALL THAT, BUT GIVE HER A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SERIES ..I'll be more than happy to watch that.
Strong Wamen taking over, netflix of course
Where is Hindi version 👀
Maybe He-Man will get a spin off show and have a show of his own lol.
Oh boy, Seems like Teela is gonna be the protagonist of this "He-Man" series.... this is gonna be rough!
ive never seen he-man but after seeing this I want to.... Where do I start? Anyone know...
Heela is there to save the day.
yep, this going to be woke as FK lol
Beautifull. Cartoon of my childhood ressurected. I just miss Hordak, but he will be in second part probably.
If you wanted it to about Teela just say so
Please dub in Hindi
Sooo this is about teela?
Where are all the trans people?
Teela and He Man are Warbuddies. Netflix has a chance to show a story where Teela helps He-Man... without all this diversity and girl power crap. I will watch it first and judge later.
It reeks of wokeness. Why can't Hollywood produce some stuff that's primarily targeted at women and other stuff that's primarily targeted at men with an undisputed male lead? Why does everything have to be for "everyone"? Just to make more cash and feed your egos on your supposed progressivity? Screw off Netflix!
He man gets the Skywalker treatment.. being shat one..
HeMen
I miss the old Heman music, childhood memories.........
So it is Teela's show Kevin Smith is full shit
Skeletor: WUT??
Forza Nino D'angelo!
Well, it's real sad what's going to be this woke cartoon. The new name is TEE-LA and the still kown tune of the universe
Either Bait in Switch or Balancing out two major stories that intertwine a lot to form ONE big story. Either way, if done correctly it'll be the best ending to the 40-year-old story.
Comeon
Finally, my childhood Animated series is back.....
Skeletor better says "You muscle-bound baffon" in this series.
Only if they ruin it with woke shit. I already spotted that "woke hairstyle". So, I am kinda afraid.
This show looks like the Greta Thunberg "how dare you" meme stretched out to an entire series.  Seriously, all the other characters are doing their job as defenders of Grayskull and Teela is the only one whining and moaning about the world?
Let´s hope it´s not woke shit as the rest of modern series.
Damn , they gendershitted this one too
He Man is white ? That's new for Netflix. Or is this racism counterbalanced by a legion of gay and trans characters ?
Teela: Still know the tune? Adam: Somethings you can never forget! “ 25 years now my life is still trying to get out that great big hill……of hope for a destination!”
Some things u can never forget....Oh!fck yeah
So it's your classic bait & switch then?
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology. He's a liar.
I will give it a try and watch episode 1, but chances are high that netflix screwed it up with the wrong lead character choice. But we all know how that marketing works. They will just look at the viewers who looked at least 1 episode and say it was a success, even if 90% just watched one
Don't fail me like you did with She-Ra
let me guess, another male-focused thing turned into a feminist power-fantasy
So Clownfish WAS right, and Adam gets side-lined for _Teela_ to be the big reluctant yet disciplined Hero and save the universe.
Plz netflix..this series dub in hindi..i m the power sunkr aj b goosbms aa jte h
More like she-women 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WTF is wrong with Teela's haircut? She was a beautiful woman in old cartoon. What is this half shaven head BS. She looks damn ugly in this.
Sooooo, The bigger question is, is she ra gonna be in this?
So... ClownfishTV was right all along.
The new Batman show, starring Robin as the main character
Still now the tune 😭😭🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️ 1:54 gave goosebumps to the 90s kids🔥🔥❤️❤️
We want tamil dubbing version
After watching this :   Goosebumps Goosebumps GoosebumpsGoosebumps Goosebumps Goosebumps Goosebumps GoosebumpsGoosebumps Goosebumps
So, this is the new Teela show 🤮
Please release tamil dubbed
Nice to see you again He Man.. Its been a while.
Hmmm...😕
Wait wait wait! This has an actual plot now?!?
Looks like another pile of woke garbage
Question. Why would finding out the truth about Adam and Heman cause Teela to give herself a horrible haircut and shave? I mean seriously.
Not liking He-mans voice.  So metrosexual sounding
Yoooo
Finally the few Answers that we Demanded are Here my friends. Now that the Facts and the Time Speak. Thanks.
Finally! An adult verson
Release in hindi
Mark Hamil as Skeletor! What a bonus!
He man ❤️❤️
If it's called he-man, I better see him more in the new show, if the shows creator wants to insert their fanfics into the show, expect a mass exodus in eternia.
So this will be shit.. Got it.
Not my HE-MAN
Okay… now after this trailer… I can see why some people might be skeptical. Is this going to be He- Man’s show or  Teela’s? Come on  Kevin Smith, don’t screw the pooch on this one.
Why He-Man's chest armour doesn't have a cross like in originals?!
omg Netflix thank you for this
I can't explain how this trailer makes no sense to me whatsoever or hints the theme and what they're trying to do I feel like it's a group of individuals who just Wikipedia He-Man and just started putting out whatever they believe is close enough.
Who is the most powerful character he-man OR Superman
Iván está como loquita
They are going to emasculate He-Man and make him the reason for the bad things. What a travesty this show will be. All the defenders will be eating crow by the end. Lets see if they got their Soy bottles ready to crybully people for pointing out the obvious bait and switch.
SJW Twist: Skeletor is a non-binary trans athlete who takes photo Ops while protesting the Eternia anthem.  Adam is Trump's Great x10 Grandfather who's destiny is to Make Eternia Great Again.
@Netflix now we need the thundercats
the child in me is so ecstatic with joy right now....man this cartoon is one of the happiest things in my life  Was the first cartoon i ever laid my eyes upon...probably was 1989 or 1990 when i was 4 yrs old at my then best friend's place....was one of the first toys i bought with the money my parents used to give me...so glad this series is being kept alive  There was a cartoon network one like 15-20yrs back which also i thought was bomb...but from what i remember it got cancelled..hope it doesnt happen to this
the show should be called "TeeLa and the SNATCH of power"
Guess this will be shit after all
This gonna be a sequel to The 80ths series? Or remake?
Yessir, by the power of grey skull
🔥💥💥🌻🌹🍒💕💕💕🩸🩸🌺💕😻😻🌹💥💥🔥🔥🌻🔥💥🔥🌻🔥💥🌹😻💕🌺😻🌺💕💜💕💕💜Yes Please!!   I ...WANT This Show!!!⚡⚡💥💕💥💥🍀💥😻💙💙🌹💙⚡💕💙💟💙🌹💙💙😻💙🌹💙💥⚡💥🔥🔥💥🔥💥🔥
Our best childhood superhero character H-Man 💪🏻
It looks more like (S)He-Man ;) - Will he (as seen so often (Loki e.g.)) play the second viola?
Couldn't they make He-mans bulge a bit bigger?
Netflix used the he-man brand power to make a teela show. Sad
Man with every single IP about male action leads, He man, Thor, James Bond, Loki being made about women, we really need to do away with the male only draft, and we should definitely combine athletics, and have women do more dangerous lines of work(98% of work place deaths are men), cause they obviously are the warriors of the future, life needs to start imitating art.
Guys. No need to fire up for a tv show, it's not even out yet and you already complain? I get the trailer shows teela and there's very little he man but maybe it's just this trailer,We can't judge without even being out. I'm nit saying it's going to be amazing but animation looks good, dubbing as well. I think we need to just relax and wait the 23 July then we can say if it's good or if it's a turd.
Is that Lena Headey as Evil-Lyn? No wonder she sounds like Big Mama from Rise of the TMNT...or Magica de Spell from Ducktales 2017?
stop making more animated serie , there's still aloooot without second part & it's riling , i've watched too much & i'll start to get confused after watching this again , at least finish few first & then start others.... you just making a looot & leaving it without second till 2-3 years laters , it's annoying...
The 80s shows may have been cheesy but at least they had a balanced formula with He-Man and She-Ra. Each show had a strong, kind and intelligent leader. He-Man and She-Ra were equals and perfectly balanced. Now we have a She-Ra show plus a Teela with He-man show. Crazy when 80s did equality better than today.
If this has any WOKE trash, I'm done with film.
The annoying thing is I want to like this markedly less useless Teela.  But pattern recognition is a thing and right now it's going off a little.
I can smell a Portuguese voice in the beginning of the video. Guess whom I am talking about.
That awkward moment when you become a side character in your own series...
ok netflix you have my attention...bought back all the childhood memories
Now make the thunder cat this style
Hahah ich dachte zuerst Mathe Mann und war überhyped
Yeah. Great. Glad. Now I just go and rewatch the original series and Castlvania while I'm at it.
Tired of the nonsense.   You owe clownfish tv an apology.
Well then... Seems like Kevin Smith owes Clownfish Media an apology for calling them liars, because it seems their reporting was spot on after all.
I just want to remind everyone this literally has a character called 'Cringer'. And after watching this I'm feeling a bit cringer myself.  P.s. stop it with all the endless remakes. Try to be original.
Sounds more like she ra. way to many female voices and characters... Its HE MAN
Queen Cercei... is that you? 😳
Like a heman
It looks good. It looks like some of the evil team will be joining the good guys too, for at least part of it. Exciting!!
Coming soon Jay and Silent Bob go Woke, and Jay will not be in that Movie 😆
Clownfish was right this is the Teela show. He-man take a seat and hold my beer woke BS will give credit for the anime
My only problem: Teela's new hair. Except that, this show seems to me good.
Any news for seasons 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-....-infinity? 🤣🤣🤣
The power of Netflix !!!!!
SOY-MAAM
Looks like another stupid feminist neo-Bolshevik crap, that infested the entertainment industry lately.
Where is Trans-He-Man
Someone owes Clownfish TV an apology.
waiting for this <3
Kevin Smith, you are a liar.  This is the Teela show, with her SJW haircut to prove she is a her-o.  Take a male story, put a female in charge, and have her act like a man that bitches about how she has always been held back by the patriarchy.  He-Man will only be a token, probably in the first episode and momentarily in the last, when Teela saves him so he can tell her she is the bestest evar.
I heard that Kevin Smith sold out and that this is going to be a pile of WOKE trash, featuring Teela as the main character.  Hope what I heard is wrong but I don't think it will be seeing as how every other shot of the trailer was Teela.
Bait and which huh damn 😅 i actually was looking forward to this one but it's the tela show I pass
Netflix India dub this series in Hindi too plzz.
WTF is this? Like they said they would complete the story left from the 80's storyline. So why does they use the look and tone of the 00's version? Why does it looks like they are going for a everything has gone to shit type of story and tone? Why don't they pick up where the stories left? Why do they set this 30 years after where the unfinished story stopped? I am so frustrated. I am pretty sure I could write a better fanfic than this million dollar shit.
Woke garbage
Not watching this woke culture garbage with Kevin Smith the liar. He never was a fan. Netflix you guys are starting to become a bunch of sucks.
I miss my HE MAN action figure
HOLY SHIT
Ok i got legit goosebumps right at the end
Nah, need the music
After a long time of war with old white men, Teela realized that she was trans.  She take a lot of hormones and get the most epic lesbian haircut in the world.  Now she´s ready to become the master of the universe.
They seem to say Eternia alot..
I am not a He-man fan but I can tell you this is going to be garbage
I am 48 years old and I can't stop smiling all the way through this trailer, I'm a big kid again!!
Horrible animation style and writing.
I love the animation, but hate the blatant bait & switch. Gonna pass.
This better be all gory and violent like Invincible, or I aint watching.
I really hate the design of the female characters. But I've found cartoon design rather unappealing for the past decade or so.   The '80s really were a golden era for children's entertainment. We'll never see its like again. Sure, the shows were hammy, but the designs were great and memorable and loveable and not divisive.
Why was Teela redesigned to look like a 2021 version of her 😤😤
Damn im this old yet i still get excited to hear this coming
Okay but why the hell does Teela get a redesign when Kevin Smith said the characters will look the same as they did in the original show🤦‍♂️ so disappointing
Nostalgia 😥
They-person
Hobby Vultures look at a perfectly good series with an old but strong fandom, and they will do EVERYTHING in their power to take it from the old fans, remove any unique features that old fans love, and prop up new characters or change existing ones until it's all as modern and generic as everything else the Vultures ever liked.
I wanted to watch he-man show, not teela show
He-gay
Panget ng gawa, but the old cartoon series was better. Sorry
What a crap voice they gave He-Man, he looks like a B as well.
I have a bad feeling about this.....
woke bait&switch 🎵🎵 woke bait&switch 🎵🎵 woke bait&switch 🎵🎵
This is how reboot are should be.
Oh yay a He-Man show with a woman lead who isn’t She-Ra yess bring on the gender swapping shows or NOT what’s she gonna say  “I have the  vajayjay”
Obviously they don't remember the tune because that's not how it goes.....it goes.....da da da daa daa da da da da daa daa da da da da daa daa da daa.
Mistress of the Unisex S01E01: Systemic Oppression of Skeletor
"IT'S MA'AM!"
When did Teela use tren and get a Karen cut??
Hmmm.. not going to watch it... nah..
So where's Prince Adams/He-Mans arc?  Lots of Tela little He-man.
Despite so many years, Skeletor still remain iconic villian.... Too bad they couldn't use the word "HEMAN"
wow, so many people whining about the fact there’s a woman as a primary character. netflix’s she-ra was absolutely fantastic so hopefully this one will follow suit
"But the Sword of Power was destroyed." "Not destroyed. Divided."  Two Swords of Power? Will it be reforged to become one? Or will the other sword go to another user?
Tee-Man and The Masters of Diversity!
He man is back
We all knew it Kevin!
They could have done thunder cats. .
so, first they dropped the Holding Out For A Hero teaser, now they are giving me this Teela Fu**d Up Everything trailer  My hype is over 9000!
Toxic heroism...
So He-man got a reboot
I have the Hype!
this smells like woke stuff
I'll pass on this one.......
What rated is this it looks like for adults
This is He Man Our childhood hero  Telecast on Doordarshan Early 80's
After all those hilarious Robot Chicken bits, I just can't help but giggle every time I see He-Man or Skeletor. Whoever did Skeletor's voice in Robot Chicken deserves a bag of awards.
If you want to divide the Sword of Power with someone and not force anger on any fan, divide the Sword between Adam and _Adora._
Animation is spot on but looks like it's gone woke so I'll give it a miss
why this music not epic
Just call it She-Ra instead then, why even bother
Another soy people scam...
*I HAVE THE POWWWWWWEEEEERRRRR!!!!* I miss the 90's
So relieving, living the childhood again
Who is that character fighting He-Man @1:13? and is that the main character now?
This will be a woke show with he-man losing in the first 2 episodes and the whamen saving the day
Dont forget guys.... its NOT about He Man.
Please tell me it won´t be that "one episode per week" shit.
What the hell did you all do to Teela though?
This has to have the original theme song somewhere. If it doesn’t show, Kevin Smith would have betrayed us.
Nope.
Past been re-created... thanks Netflix's
I HAVE THE BETA MALE!
Omg yes!!! This looks awesome, I’m a child again 😍
Bait and switch again
Not He Man...
Would it have any relation to netflix's She-Ra?
You just couldn't help yourself and gender bend MAN-at-arms, haven't you?
what? wait... the sword got split into two? now we got two half He-Man?
Was Adam always such a loser without his sword? I only watched the old series as a kid and it was so long ago where he didn't look like a little lost kid. I don't like it at all how he acts and looks here.
Armin
No one want a clam (teela) to be the hero.   What a joke !  This will fail.
He-man is back, childhood favourite
I want a live action movie on he-men
luke skywalker to joker to Skeletor . Damn you mark hammil
I will never watch this drivel. Netflix wasted so much money
Clownfish Tv was correct about everything their source said, and Kevin Smith boldface lied to the He-Man fandom that it wouldn't sideline Adam/He-Man to focus on Teela. The bait and switch from the first trailer to this one makes me not want to even watch this.
The original He-man theme was better. This was a bit bland.
Dramatic garbage
ah.. the strong female character and diversity. It's official folks netflix ruined this classic as well.
I just want to tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ loves you very much and died for you.
That first teaser was great, this just makes me sad :(
GET WOKE GO BROKE !   This is trash !
He man
Kevin Smith is a liar
Emotionless voice acting and the trailer already revealed this is not going to be the He-Man I grew up with, its sad to see yet another classic is being abused. You can keep your woke bait and switch trash, Im looking forward to hear how deep the red numbers are going to be. Smith does owe ClownfishTV an apologee.
When when when???
Sarah Michelles voice does not fit Teela
I must confess, I've never been a big fan of He-Man, but this looks pretty cool.  But, I find it quite pathetic that people are believing in these false rumors, in particular He-Man not being a main character. Uh, he clearly is. There's only so much you can gleam from trailers, the only difference being which character they focused on. If trailers accurately told you what the movie was, then the first Godzilla vs Kong trailer would suggest that Kong would dominate Godzilla. Spoilers: The monkey lost!  And then there is this pathetic anti-woke crowd, who ironically are the SJWs they claim to be against. Like, what? Having a strong woman is suddenly a political statement? Does no one remember Prince Adam wearing a pink shirt, having a perfectly waxed chest, describing his powers as "fabulous", and the PSAs at the end of the episodes? He-Man was ALWAYS woke! The only difference is you're old enough to realize it!  Look, if this show is bad, it's bad and by all means tear it a new one. But at least don't believe garbage rumors from We Got This Covered and Bounding Into Comics
Damn nice..transformers and now this...😁
Golden days are back
Oh nice the new Castlevania season looks lit!
-He Man- Let's see how this works out for you, Netflix.
Imagine what would happen if this He-Man series pulls a "John Connor".
Another woman with identity crisis...
So... where is Orco?
Final post credit scene She Ra makes an appearance mark my words
Just cancel netflix soon He man will just be turned into a Map. Stop supporting garbage that is designed to destroy what you love they will keep breaking everything their goals is to break you. They can't do that if you just stop caring about anything they put out. Turn your back on them. Support people who care. No need to even get mad they are pathetic & can't create anything eventually they will fade you can see it already happening. We will eventually take over when we do we will fix all of this. It will take time,  but they aren't reproducing. Take your kids out of their evil schools teach them right don't let them watch this trash we  have already won they just don't realize it yet.
This looks pretty interesting. Definetly going to give it a watch
The person who made Mambostuck worked on this. Homestuck is everywhere. Think about that. /j
Whoever is putting these trailers together is a legend. The first one was a pure nostalgia fest, but this one complimented that by giving more ideas of what's actually happening. I love it!
The took concepts from another Filmation show called BlackStar where the power star sword was split in two
Teela show confirmed. Smh kevin smith.
Ohhhh yeah… these homoerotic overtones are giving me life
Heyayaya!
Also, I understand wanting a more serious tone than the original series...but this seems like a bit too much doom and dire speeches for me. I guess this is what people want out of their nostalgic escapist fantasy?
So pretty Teela is going to lose the opening battle and flash-forward two years later will be Xena, lesbian princess. Got it.
Nostalgia at its best ❤️
Revelation is Teela is on roids.
This looks freekin' awesome! 1984 all over again!
Release an unbelievably good trailer the other week with the sickest music. And now we have this. I mean it's not a bad trailer, but it's not the first trailer.
You have not shown evolve of tiger ....🙄
I remember getting bullied when I was 7 and then I screamed I HAVE THE POWERRRRR! The other kids thought I went crazy and just ran for their life .... but yeah I get it why they used to bully me I was dumb lol
What in the name of my childhood is going on here
"She-man" would have been a more woke name.
First She-Ra, now this. This revival is looking good! Love Adam's voice and that they kept his iconic pink jacket, can't wait to see this!
கிரேஸ்கல் கோட்டையின் சக்தியே ... என்னுள் இருக்கும் சக்தியே ...💥💥
Woke
Woke bollocks!!!!! If you wanted a female/male He-Man team up... USE SHE-RA!!!!! (His twin sister that inspired an entire generation of girls) Why make a He-man program that's about his sidekick!!
Kevin Smith is a liar fact
DOOOOPE
I'm still shocked they didn't go the She Ra route with this one.
UGLY Teela now has thaaa POWAAAA !!! lol Would have LIKED true Teela being the protagonist, but not THIS one... :(((
So...  He- Man becomes evil Teela takes the other part of a broken sword and takes on He-man in a sword combat  Also from an amazing woman Teela becomes a man. Because why ? She is doing a mans job ? Sod off. Teela was amazing, strong, beatiful warrior. Now she is Tilor - gymbro that snacks Trenboloni sandwiches.  You could have made an amazing show with this budget. We love ( old ) Teela, but this is a He-Man show. And you messed it
its called he-man not she-man
I want to see more... Like the masters of the universe travelling to other planets in said universe...
She-Ma'am and the Masters of the Wokeverse.
I think this looks awesome, I'm not bothered at all with Teela having more prominent role in the show, but PLEASE, don't let He-Man be a secondary character in his own show.
I HAVE THE POWEER
G4E
Clownfish TV deserve an apology for the lies given to them by series creator Kevin Smith, if he can hold back his tears long enough.  When they were leaked news that Teela would be sidelining He Man in his own show, they rightfully said the fans would be displeased.  Smith attacked them for the revelation, stating that it was a lie and He Man would be the hero.    But here we are, with Teela being framed as the hero and the comments section is full of doubtful fans pissed off by the bait and switch.  Kevin Smith is now a hack.  I cannot believe I once liked his movies.  But then again, I am saying that about more and more Hollywood elites these days.  My utter disappointment in the lack of creativity or morals in modern Hollywood is hitting its breaking point.
Ok so it's not really He-Man, it's actually someone featuring He-Man. Must say disappointed, though, in all seriousness, not surprised.
Strong. Female. Woman. It's about time!
This bs is gonna continue. They removed Heman’s name from the title and nerfed him to give to spot the ——. Keep feeding this bs, i am gonna see the actual heman where he was the man
Teela oh a trying her best to look like a MAN! And that awful Haircut. 🤮
I wonder how people would have reacted if Bow had been the main character of the "She-Ra" reboot.
At last someone made revived this series. Lets see how good is this one.   But I dont like the dilogue delivery of “I have the power”  Its not as powerful as the one in the original.
Now I have to go watch Skeletor vs Beastman 50 times in a row
How did they butcher record of Ragnarok but not this
Legends: New Skeletor memes 🙈
The shocking revelation will be that the main character is neither Teela nor He-Man, but Courtney Cox from the movie! ;) :D
Is this He-man trailer or She-man trailer?
Fuk magic gimme a sword. Babes and a tiger! Call me HIMHEMAN!
oh netflix... you know how to get my attention...<3
in animation a sword can be placed anywhere and it doesn't create any body obstruction and damage during movement 😁
Another franchise sacrificed on the altar of woke. Evil cannot create, it can only corrupt.
So Clownfish was right all the time. Yep didn't see that one coming
The Teela, the new Man (at arms) Show ... and He-Ma'am.
Nooooooo! Why are they calling this He Man? It's clearly a spin off show called Teela!
A splitten sword?  Already saw in "Blackstar" and also in a Transformer series...
How does Daisy Ridley do it? How can someone sound wooden even in a voice over?
Nice drawn and animated. But Teela looks like a man and she is more prominent as He-Man or Adam in this Trailer. Is it the Teela Show after all, and Clownfish TV was right all along?
The narrator in the beginning sounded like Cersei Lannister...
Pls Teen Wolf new season
Between the trailer and the comments I've seen, this gives me Last of Us part 2 vibs. Hope I'm wrong.
By the power of the Grey Skull.. I am the Powerrrrr !! ❤️😍 He-Man !! ❤️
What I find funny is Teela throws her tiara on the ground, as if it's a sign that she's no longer "Girly" and then goes to get a sidecut.... which is actually less practical than the Tiara when it comes to keeping hair out of her eyes in combat.
Can’t wait- looks awesome!
So clownfish tv was right, wonder why Kevin Smith lied
I must say, after seing the comments, seems like that was a great way to spark even more outrage and cause many to engage even more - they'll have both the fanboys who'll hate watch the hell out of this - and go on to make thousands of videos about how bad and "SJW-esque" it is -, and people who had no idea this thing existed but will watch it after getting it in their recommendations cause it looks cool - and cause enough fanboys will have complained about it all over the internet, inflating its popularity. Well played, I'd say.
Clownfish was Right the Whole Time Kevin Smith Need to Apologize to Clownfish immediately
a big middle finger to any he-man fan
Skelly: Behold the lord of destruction Vs Skeletor: oh petrified
Legend
Please all I ask is that u dont make my boy a side character....give them both equal footing and I'll chill
Looks mad pozzed
The stereotype lesbians, wow good job at fuckin another property up kevin. Its called He Man, not tela and the lesbian, what is with these creators anymore? Awful just awful. Man that animation is wasted.
He Man And The Masters Of The Universe , you changed that to Masters of the Universe, now  we know why....
Could you add 47 meters down uncaged?
Childhood time has come back, He-Man The Master Of Universe
We want Tamil dubbed
C'mon lads for Eternia!!!🔥🔥🔥
Another series that Netflix ruin it !
The misogyny in the comments is real 😂😂😂
No I'll pass this show
He has never more lived up to the gay meme years back then now as an animal series. She ra pulled it off better and she was actually gay.
"I am the Power" Brought back so many childhood memories. Thank you Netflix.
Well look who's lying now.
Please release in hindi language also
so now we have 100% confirmation this show is about Teela and her half shaved head.  Woke shit needs to die, WE WANT HE-MAN
Oh nice, der Mathemann kriegt eine eigene Serie
They going woke? please no....
Rename this Teela and the Masters of the Universe!
Are there no Asians in this world?
Didn't take them long to start removing dislikes didn't it? It's like instead of cleaning dust you swipe in under a carpet. IT'S STILL THERE NETFLIX!
Where is teela and who is this Karen?
Skeletor was high key the GOAT
Where in the is battle cat at cringer sounded horrible and not to hear battle cat talk wow drop the ball there Netflix
I am wondering if any of the "true fans" here handwringing over a supposed bait and switch knows of the MOTU lore. I fully understand the frustration with Dreamwork's She-Ra but it looks here that the trailer has elements of MOTU lore and seems faithful to it.   Yes, He-Man is the central character but the other MOTU characters are no less important and have  significant impact on the story. Teela  primarily being one of them.   This is a continuation of the 80s series so anyone who's watched it will know that Teela's ultimate destiny is to be the the next Sorceress of Castle Grayskull as she is the Sorceress' (Teela Na) daughter and both the 80s and 200x cartoons have been explicit about this eventuality. it may well be she'll take up that Snake form as the new sorceress. At  least, I hope to see that.  Therefore, there is no way Teela will usurp Adam's place and become the new "She-man" or whatever it is people are calling it now as she has her own major destiny to fulfill. Wielding the sword of power is not one them. This will still be a role only Adam, ie He-Man can assume, so relax...  Teela, in her role as the next sorceress, will be charged in protecting Greyskulls' magical secrets and being the guardian of the swords of power. In that respect, this series seem to be pointing to that direction where she is tasked in finding the sword of power so that He-Man can come back.   I don't know. I am just happy that these character get to return and their stories are being fleshed out. Why not watch it first before passing judgement?
Show seems to be taking itself way too seriously. I see the lack in lightheartedness/ humor in it's storytelling style.   And on a side note, what's with the shaved side on Teela's head?  Let me guess.. she's gay now, right? Sooo original!   Oh, Evil-Lynn is a good guy now?  Adam seems like a weakling & He-man failed Eternia?  Oh, rainbow transformation, weeee!   Subverting expectations so much, it's gonna be the best show ever!!
Dubbed in hindi 😍😍
Teela: Still know the tune? Adam: Some things you can never forget. Adam: And I said Heeeeyyheeyyyyheeeeyy
Cersei Lannister‘s Voice
... i now want to see a crossover of Adora traveling to Etheria and hoping to find the family she was taken from and just bam, meets Adam, also i'd love to see Adora in this art style
😂😂lol they made it look like an action film
Finally childhood back 🙌🏽 🔥
i was interested but now i am half as much i did not grow up with OG he-man (i'm only 29) but i did with the 2002 series and thats what i am basing my expectations on and i am moving closer to the exit row each time i see a new trailer.
Shoutout to Laura legend for introducing me to those shows that I didn’t know
Yesss. Can ya make SWAT Cats?
OK I was super sceptical when I saw Netflix was doing A He-Man now that I saw this I understand this is a Teela show which is in concordance with the Netflix way.
ഗ്രസ്‌ക്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി... ആ കോട്ടയിൽ ഉറങ്ങും ആ ശക്തി പുറത്തു vaaaaaaaaaaa.... 😻
Another Netflix Disaster,you ruined transformers and Voltron and now your destroying He Man by sidelining him in his own show.Another woke mess with identity politics.
Another victim in the alter of wokeism and feminism
if there was any doubt before that He-Man ( Prince Adam ) was gay... he now turns into a rainbow.  The fur bikini briefs. The pink tights. His best friend is a cat. Now he turns into a glowing rainbow when he holds his sword....
It's weird how the name of the voice actor for He-Man is only first listed for the first and last episodes of this on IMDb.  Also that many of the other character's actors are more famous than him (Sarah Michelle Gellar as Teela for example).   This is gonna be woke isn't it?
That's fake...bloody hell, how can you ruin such a beautiful series. Still love to see old series only. Some changes are not required.
where is orko?
The teela show no thanks
And they had She-Ra but it wasn't enough they have to ruin everything that we love
He-Man used to be trashy Flash Gordon on steroids. But this looks like a generic anime with the usual terrible animation quality from a western studio.
ok animation team, outside of the main character being not He-Man, here's one thing that just bothers the eye even more, PLACE THE DAMN SWORD OUTSIDE THE BACK OF HIS ARMOR! goddamn that's terrible practical design, inside of his armor?? XD
We want our real he-man.
Go woke go broke not one red cent of  mine is going towards this trash
Anime is better
Teela: "still remember the song?" Adam: "it's raining men... hallelujah"
Few seconds of Orko in trailer would have been icing on the cake ...
❤❤❤❤❤❤😈
All those 40+ 😎😘😘😘😘
Eh...just eh
Looking forward to this!
My first ever action figure was of He-Man
Can't wait for new skeletor memes
Why do they always change beautiful and charismatic female characters into that feminist ugly buddies with shaved head and bad attitude?
Thumbnail made me click the video
So I can pretty much deduce that the sword of power got divided and now teela will be the main character and He-man will be evil. So they got rid of he-man to give teela the spot light.   I just hope it's written well since I love masters of the universe.
And once again... the Woke left-tards destroyed something only coz they are too dumb to create something of their own... GG Netflix.
Please Netflix, release this great series in Indian Region too, we have lot of fans Waiting for this on Netflix India. !!
will He-Man still be called He-Man or will it be Them-Non-Binary for a proper 2021 release?
For a He Man show... not much of him on this... why does he look like a support character to everyone else...?
I can't speak for anyone else but I'm kinda hyped for this.
Tamil dubbed varuma
Lots of butt-hurt basement-dwelling snowflake incels crying on here, pretty hilarious…
They should have been honest and just called it the Teela Show, as this trailer is now looking like the series is a bait and switch. First trailer was great though.
So this is Teela and the Masters of the Universe.. wtf
Teela looks more like prince Adam...just saying
La luna sangre I request please
I'm confused why is everyone hating this
Ill watch this, I kinda like the idea of he-man actually loosing at the start IF (and its a big if) the writing is good, and it makes sense, and the redemption ark is well set out.   I mean, I also REALLY like the idea of Skeletor winning as well. : )
What is with this stupid haircut they keep giving female characters its literally cookie cutter at this point, and why does Teela look so much bigger than prince Adam? I thought this was a continuation of the original show? Prince Adam was jacked! 😂 Tell me there's no woke agenda in your show kevin smith, you liar lair pants on fire.
So cool to see animation in 5 frames per second….
She-Ma'am
"Still remember the tune?"  "Some things you never forget... Young man, there's no need to feel down I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground..."
Can we see laila and yelumban in the series??
Yay...another good child hood memory destroyed by modern woke "diversity and equality"....thanks Netflix......Star Trek - Dead, Star Wars - Dead, He-Man - Dead, Marvel - Meh, going full woke COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS instead of shitting on the past.
GÖLGELERİN GÜCÜ ADINA
Another woke garbage from wokeflix. Crap wraped in shiny candy paper just to somehow desive paeaple into watch it.
Is this another feminist thing?
Such a bait already ima skip this woke shit .
Still know the tune?! Somethings you can never forget!!! 😍😍😍
The Heman transformation is funny ... looks like Sailormoon, except it is Sailor Man Lololol. Come on Netflix, a little grimness in Eternia should be ok!
Ka-Ren and the Masters of I want to speak to the manager...
Pride flag on top of castle grayskull
Is it just me or does prince Adam look the most feminine in this, looks like Adam and Teela aren't getting together and in the future have a son that takes the power sword to become He_Ro
Was that Shera?
Was waiting for the "I need a hero" tune from the first trailer 😥
This reminds me of times when Jim sterling was funny
Well done Kevin and Mark and the rest of the team I can’t wait for this to drop. Mark Hamil as Skeletor is simply brilliant.
What’s the betting that Prince Adam’s twin has the other half of the “Powersword” (She’Ra)🤔
Ok, so now it's obvious this is teela show after all. Well they did a good job at hiding it in the first trailer, but this one... it'll be a hard pass for me...
They gave Teela the angry feminist Lesbian haircut. Just so you know it's by Netflix.
Thank you for this. What a friggin amazing trailer. Can't wait!
Why does He-Man have an ‘H’ on his chest instead of an ‘Iron Cross’?
*Clássico HE-MAN! Doidinho pra assistir essa obra de arte!*
Turning a two dimensional kids cartoon into a vehicle to push an agenda . Nice .
is it thunder x?
Annnnnnd the bait and switch happened. What a surprise....
We should've seen that He-Man was missing from the title and not got our hopes up.  But even called Masters of the Universe there seems to be very little of the Masters here. Ram-Man? Stratos? Why call it Masters of the Universe when there barely seems to be any of them in the show? I was beyond excited when I heard about this. I loved the 2002 show. But it turned out this way sadly...Damn you Kevin Smith!
I love the animation and just fun BUT I am a little worried about this storyline.. He man is supposed to be cheezy and fun..
I feel girl enpowerment... I hope it would be just good show not girl power movie całego he-man
Please stop destroying our 80s childhood, with SJW virtue signalling, judging from the trailer Netflix already is pushing out Virtue Signalling, feminism and bs like every other thing they destroy, i.e. Death Note etc.. please STOP Netflix, you have no original content so you have to just use old IP's to have 'content' and push your bs political agenda across childhood memories.. just stop!
It's the teela show! He-man just got demoted to being a side-character in his own show.
Will adora be in it? 👀
40-50 y/o men thinking this cant be as good as when.... can it?
She man and the masters of Uranus.
guess 'HE- Man and the masters of the universe' would have been too offensive to the snowflakes netflix is so desperately trying to satisfy .. maybe that's why so much emphasis on the chick with the typical LGBT haircut n something about women empowerment.. gosh i miss when cartoons were just cartoons.
ഗ്രേസ്കൾ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന് ഉള്ളിൽ ഒത്തുങ്ങുമാാാാ ശക്തി കൂടിവാാാാ.....🗡😂
Looks amazing and the beautiful vibrant colors…. Sweet!
Intha series konjam Tamil la vidugalen
GreySkull கோட்டையின் சக்தியே..💥🔥🤩😌
If it is like a short serie like Castlevania then yes I will bench this.
is this show a continuation of the original cartoon ? cuz in the original he-man's overall look seems to be identical between normal and transformed , except for darker skin tone and more orange colored hair.
Another childhood show woke'ised...
netflix and their multi project deals
Chota bheem bhi add karle😂
What a strong white male in 2021 ?  No wait... never mind.
I am very grateful to Netflix, thank you very much for not changing HE-MAN's sexual orientation, thank you for keeping his color, thank you for respecting an original idea, changing things from how they were created is also racism and negligible THANK YOU NETFLIX , love you.
Lmao welp looks like it’s gone woke 💩
ClownfishTV was right.
Eternia is such a terrible name. lol
💖
Why does every western female character has to have that awful half shaved hair lmao
efsanee
He_Man!
Too much of Teela....
I literally only just realised He-man isn't even in the show title 😭 No wonder Teela is the new focus 🙄
Stop whining. It's anime for a western audience. Enjoy it or go and watch demon slayer. Cos that shit is awesome!
Is this a show 'featuring' He Man?
woowww!! I LOVE this 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
A Teela Story
I have the power
Mad respect for the studio for drawing he-mans nipples with no shame
if someone wants to make lgbtq superhero or something similar, than he need to create new character and leave our child heroes alone
Do I KNOW the tune? And I said HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA.I sAid hEY! whATs gOinG oN?
"ⁱ ᵃᵐ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳⁱᵇⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳⁱᵇᵉˢ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡⁱᵏᵉˢ ᵐʸ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ"
Where's Ram-Man?
It's good to see him as a skinny guy when he is normal and gets freakishly muscular after turning into He-man.
Lesbians of the Universe: Revolting
Looks amazing Like castelvenia
Where is the he-man chest cros?
Allahu EKBER
Holy mother of all sweet and pure
I can only hope Kevin Smith doesn't let us down.
Wtf He-Man comes back in all his glory with a sleek new look, while She-Ra came back as a goofy androgynous kid. I hope she cameos in this series as her old, beautiful self.
In the series finale we find out Teela is Captain Marvel's ancestor
Great anime
What happened to "BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL" is it somehow not pc? Just asking
High chance Netflix will woke this up and destroy a franchise.  Hope not.
What a great trailer
even cringer is being dramatic...
So who all are gay in this one
Kevin smith ! you are a liar !!! teela is the man character! !! be very careful in the next convention you attend to go........ very careful.
By the look of this show I'm shocked they didn't find the word "Masters" too problematic to be in the title.
Gracekkal കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി... HeMan🔥🔥🔥 മച്ചാനെ അത് പോരളിയ 🔥
The series is clearly about Teela and she looks like absolute trash in this they are straight up butchering our childhood
He-man 🔥🔥🔥 is back ❤️❤️❤️
Sooo He-man is now Teela sidekick... sad. What a waste of good animation.
I am going live my childhood era again with the new fantasy...Thank you Netflix..... ❤️
That is the most bisexual solar moon ass transformation and IM HERE FOR IT
Teela and her sidekick He-Man. 🤦🏽‍♂️  I am Out!
holy shit
1:55 yes
Great, more bait&switch. Thanks a lot Netflix, for ruining He-Man.
"Still remember the tune?" "And I said HEYYYYAHYAYYYYAH"
*wat?*
i have the poooooovvvvvvveeerrrrrrrr
Now this is a Prince Adam I can root for. This guy looks like he needs to turn into He-Man, not some muscle bound freak who took his long sleeve and pants off! No offense to bodybuilders
Smart money this is a she boot
You guys are really ‘owning the libs’ in these comments, huh?
And the trailer looks so good.... But He-Man isn't the ma in character so I've heard🤷🏾‍♂️
WOKE 😢
Why do they always give the female lead the lesbian haircut?it looks ridiculous.
If they want it to be the MCU for He-Man... they DEFINITELY need to include She-ra, Etheria and the evil Horde. The 2002 series did great things with Hordak, & now Netflix has the show/movie rights for BOTH franchises... so, quoting Spike Lee, do the right thing, and finally restore them to their original status as ONE "master" feranchise, and then go from there, keeping He-Man as He-Man, She-Ra as She-Ra, Skeletor as Skeletor, Hordak as Hordak, & bringing all the epic.
Teela and the soy boys of the universe
Cressida called and wants her haircut back, and Sailor moon isn't too happy with Adam either.
@Netflix Please reboot the series, Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperfast Go...
besides the fact that I'm a big fan of He-Man ,Netflix Animation has been on point lately
Fans: we heard this show was all about Teala, we don't like that. Kevin Smith: I can't believe you all accept these lies, it's a He-man show, you're all so mean! (Releases this trailer) Fans: why is the focal point of your trailer Teala getting a hair cut? Kevin Smith: you're all just bullies 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"Lets reboot He-Man with less He-Man" -Netflix, of course.
NOSTALGIA1!!!!!!!!!! OMG
Oh man bring good old days. He-man is a beast. Used to watch he man voltron and thunder cats back in the day. Damn am i getting old.
Please bring back Swat Kats
Isn't the term "Masters" very problematic nowadays? Not only because of missing inclusivity but also in connection with slavery? I don't have a good feeling about this title.
He-man should be the main guy not the girl.
Oh shit it's the chad-man himself
Hmmm...I'm getting The Last Jedi vibe....not good.
“Still remember the tune?”  But not even a hint of the original theme music.
So what about clownfish tv... where they said you were sidelining Heman for a female character. You said they were wrong and lying but this trailer proves it...
He-Man with a female lead... How very Netflix-like.
This trailer already ruined my childhood
Freakin Awesome ❤️
where my dude buzz off?
Heman had so little going on in this thing
Kevin Smith tytytytytytyty :)
my entire childhood
Bonie Tyler. Missed.
He man
Who's the redheaded bloke? ... OH thats Teela 😂
I really hope this isn't a Teela focused show since Kevin Smith specifically said it wasn't, if it is, shame on you...
This trailer was seizure inducing
"I am the power!"
If it was an anime, I would watch it. It's a children's cartoon.
I grew up watching HE - MAN.  Bad ass.
Why does teela look so manish and angry?
Omg Kevin lied right to us on Fatman Beyond…Yo this actually kinda hurts. It’s like finding out Santa Claus is actually Harvey Weinstein 😞
Worst trailer in the history of Netflix. You could have made a marvel out of it yet you settle for this.
Congrats Netflix you done f@&kin goofed
damn isnt that HE MAN? jesus
I am out....
I thought it was thunder cats from the thumbnail🙄🙄
Will there still be the tiger
Awesome......... 😁
He-man 😀😇😝😍😁😆😉
I hate that hair cut sooooo much. Evening else looks amazing though.
This trailer gave me goosebumps, seeing an old cartoon I used to watch as a kid being remastered
I love soft He-Man.
Grayskull koattayin Sakthi🤩🤩💥
Teela: "Still remember the tune"  Prince Adam: " Yeah ! So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed to just get it all out what's in my head and I, I'm feeling a little peculiar ar ar.  And so I wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath & get real high and I scream from the top of my lungs WHAT'S GOIN' ON?!!  And I say hey yeahyeah yeah yay Hey yeah yeah I say hey, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?!! YEAH!!! "
Yay ya ya yaaaaaa Yay ya ya yaaaaaaaa  Memes
See why we need gate keeper's.
Looks great!
Looks coo! I'm watching
Why, why, why do strong "whamen" always need a Karen haircut? Pretty girls can be tought just as well. Gosh, stop it Hollywood.
Did I see Tella fighting He Man. dear me the rumours were true. and what happened to Adam's voice. Kevin's sold out years ago.
Sorry She Ra He Man is back

please! pleeeeeeeeeeaaaaase Netflix don’t ruin my childhood with woke shit
He MAN ...
🔥❤
Character with LGBTQ hairstyle, priceless...
I used to watch He-man when i was a kid
This doesn't feel like He-Man at all. And although animation looks good but still not upto the mark especially in character design and their dynamics department. But I still hope that its as good as 2002 reboot.
Have they decided to suck up to feminists again?
Where is Ram Man
Amazing
Women? Not for me thanks Clive.
The guy who made it said it is a direct sequel to the 80's cartoon and HE-MAN is the main character. A lot of people seem it think Teela is the lead, she is not.
This is not Teela. This is not what she represents, how she acts.Teela was fiercely loyal to the Royal family and captain of the Royal guard. This is complete opposite. What's wrong with her original outfit? She actually looked cool in it. Her new hair cut is feminist hair nmbr 4. One of my friends who is a feminist has a same haircut. And her male outfit sucks ass. So suddenly she can hold her own against power of the Greyskull? Give me a break.   PS: Kevin, you liar! You own apology to some fans you smeared for being right.
well it didnt feel like he-man of our childhood tbh
He-Man, that is the title.  However, it seems it isn't his story.  Guess we have to put identity politics in everything now.
Very concerned they went the woke route  with Teela.
WEAK!
Some huge red flags here 😅 Nah, I don’t think I will watch.
why Teela looks like a man?
He-Mam 😑
What's with people's obsession with making women look and act like men. They cry about toxic masculinity yet their idea of a strong female is a woman who acts like a toxic male. Probably projection, it's only okay when I do it.
oh, I hope this doesn't suck. That said I have complete faith in Kevin Smith.
❌ He-Man ✔️ He-Bro
Every thing is just stunning... except the SWORD... he-man s sword is below Average 😭
This is cringe. He-Man is the side character now. A strong woman is now the #1. Just like the rest of the recent garbage. Netflix is woke remember. Don't bother with it
Well..... there goes my enthusiasm. Clownfish was right.
Goospumps! I love it!  An salty old white man go home, please!
The girls now all covered up their breast... Sad ..
He-Man   - remember the old memories.
Omg too many childhood memories. Ty netflix 🤗 "somethings you can never forget"
You had one job. ONE. Shouldn’t He-Man be the front and center main character of a He-Man reboot? Is it too much to ask that the lead role not be handed to some female side character nobody cares about? Still looks amazing (visually at least), but..... really?
We need a new rendition of the Heyya
He man reboot
So Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1 Series is about Teela now.
Disturbia.
Hot fresh trash, get your hot fresh over here !
it is a No from me
He -man fan like ❤️❤️
he man will be on only the first episode then on the last
I hope this boner goes down within 4 hours.  I don’t need a trip to the hospital tonight.
I swear if they make this another Ending of Voltron, I'm gonna shit on them nonstop
He man be replaced just for wo man rather get Jupiter's legacy s2
Thanks Obama... jeez !
Need Tamil dubbing to watch
why wasn't she-ra done like this?
Trailer playing .. Me: that's He Man right , ye that's HMan . Hold on so y this not called HMan.Anyway at least its Hman . Right , ofcourse its Hman..Comes back to reality trailer ended.
I feel like a Child again! This is glorious 😍
Why does Teela look like a man?!?
So the leaks were true mam of the universe in charge :p I am disappointed think i'm gonna drop netflik soon.
The sword of power is bi now? Imagine my surprise... Shoehorn in another Mary Sue why don't you?
Bitcoin+SHIBA INU coin buy
Please do gargoyles or thundercats next
Get em He Man for the sake of our universe!
They're going to screw this up aren't they? I can just feel it.  Edit: Yep they screwed it up. I've read the reviews and I'm not interested.
He man😍😍😍😍
False advertising. It's more about Teela than He-man. They're making her more masculine(ironic, isn't it) and cast He-man on the sidelines.  Not recommended
Thundercats next? Yes? Please?
I heard cerci Lannister in there lol
Honestly,  what happened Kevin Smith?. I used to hold him such high regards. To see you fall like this just to appease the Fake-Woke is sad to see.   Everyone can see the bull💩 coming
He man is back
I love that they added the slight echo to he-man's voice when he goes super-saiyan, like in the originals. Can really feel the high voltage
Removed from title - check Female voice over - check Feminised hero - check Masculinised heroine - check Shaved head - check
Can’t wait! I remember getting Castle Grayskull for Christmas when it was originally released! Such good memories! Can’t wait for this!!!
I just wanna see skeleton run and laugh
- "Still know the tune?"  Me: Goosebumps <3
So the rumors are true. This is about Teela. 😂 Woke Hollywood strikes again
Stupid people disliking the trailer has no idea what dis is literally... It was d best time of my childhood
Cercei from got just made the show 10x better.
🙂 സന്തോഷം ആയി
Still gay af
On the one hand I'm looking forward to the series, but on the other hand I also hope that you understand the series, even if you haven't watched the old series. I don't understand why they didn't do a reboot like they did with She-Ra. Then maybe Netflix could have done a crossover at some point.
I'm missing the theme song, Netflix, gimme the original theme song and nobody gets hurt.
wow
Oh all these old men crying in the comments about a strong woman being an important part in a reboot show.... we live in a sad world! I love the trailer - this is going to be epic like it is!
She-Man
This is gonna be a train wreck. Just wait and see.
Ok but what about a she-ra cross over episode?
Finally doing he-man right....yes can't wait to see it
Still remember the tune? "I said, HEyYeahyeyeyeah, HEEEy yeah yeah, I said HEy, What's going on"
If He-Man doesn't remain the central character or is unnecessarily side-lined, consider faith in humanity as shaken.
After getting that awesome nostalgia pump from that first trailer/song, I just realized…  I’m 42 and watching cartoons is boring af 😂
i 💕 ❤️ Heman 👍
Kevin Smith is the man, the new daddy of He-man
I'm glad they made prince Adam and heman look different instead of he-man being Adam without his shirt.
' ഗ്രെസ്കൾ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നുളിൽ ഒതുങ്ങുമാർ ശക്തി കൂടിവാ ' Nostalgic line which i can't forget. ❤
Yeah I am waiting for WFC kingdom trailer , Netflix!!!!
Last scene goosebumps tho⚡⚡⚡⚡
He man 😎
ah yeah it looks SICK but magic is gone? Which implies a new bittersweet end? okay that was the only thing I DID NOT like from thsi story.
AND I SAY HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
Looks like Teela has a new ‘friend’ at 01:15  Gotta tick those boxes.
My chilhhood have been revive
Mathemann <3
Netflix: Have a berry ....... Audience: ... Memoriesssss.....
Any chutti tv viewer who saw him as he man in tamil in small age as kid “valin sakthiye veliya va he man”  ,remember that tune anyone
Plz don’t be hype Plz don’t be hype Plz don’t be hype Pl…
i have the power!!!!!
He Man
he/him man and the masters of the universe.
I liked the new She-ra. Here's hoping that this is onpar with it.
Goosebumps❤️
Get my money now!
Where my man skeletor at?
A serious He Man series and all the side characters get a chance to shine. Plus some new ones. This version might actually work.
Man like gray skull!! Let’s goooooo!
Stop giving your money to people who hate you...  ... Add She-Man to the list.
It's a longtime pending show! Awesome
The sword of power is split to let teela shine
Wow! This looks epic.
Tears...
SHOCKING!!! Looks like Disney/Netflix have ruined another of my child favourites. Why is my childhood being ruined by  DISNEY & NETFLIX!!!
From He-Man to She-Woke. Netflix is a damn joke.
So it turns out Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology. It's really sad. The voice cast is good. The music sounds really good. The animation looks fantastic. It had the potential to be a really good Masters of the Universe show. But sadly it's just another woke Hollywood show with Teela being pissed at everyone  I skipped Rise of Skywalker, I canceled my Disney + subscription and I won't watch this show.
Yay, more woke stuff, that's exactly what we need
He man
at least adam doesnt look exactly like he man this time.
This is gonna be unreal 😃. Can't wait!
"A radical return to Eternia, Revelation is a direct sequel series to the classic era of Masters of the Universe. Featuring fan favorites He-Man, Orko, Cringer, and Man-At-Arms, the story pits our heroic warriors, and guardians of Castle Grayskull against Skeletor, Evil-Lyn, Beast-Man and the vile legions of Snake Mountain. But after a ferocious final battle forever fractures Eternia, it's up to Teela to solve the mystery of the missing Sword of Power in a race against time to prevent the end of the Universe! Her journey will uncover the secrets of Grayskull at last. This is the epic He-Man and the Masters of the Universe saga fans have waited 25 years to see!"   Yup Teela's the main character
I cant believe how many mysoginist people are in these comments smh
Excited to see and cherish some moments from childhood 😍😍👍
Pls hindi dubbed ❤️
Haha He looks like a girl.
What a BIG surprise! A strong white hetero man main character degraded to the SIDEKICK of the strong female character. WHO EVER COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS?? Using the nostalgia of the old He-Man fans to generate views just to disappoint them with your agenda as usually . Netflix...clap clap.
I'mma just say that cartoons from the 80s were and are always gonna be terrible, stop trying to reboot these lame ass stories
this series will increase the value of my MOTUS action figures i bought last year.  OUTSTANDING!
Heyayaya in 4k
Where is his Battle Cat?
Hmm. I really hope they still focus mostly on He-man :/
He-Man the first openly gay cartoon character?
1:50 AND I SAY HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
Childhoon relives
Skeletor is Luke Skywalker
Why does Teela turn into a bloke halfway through the trailer?
Damn my childhood
Kevin Smith killed He-man.
Looks woke af
Это шедевр
He Man should be the one who look bad ass not Teela. But everyone is afraid about "Me Too" and this bringing us mentally-ill- haircut-Teela with more power and attitute than He Man. Aaaaand another franchise is lost.
Still waiting for that Thunder Cats anime (2011) to come back
please release in hindi dubbed
Looks great! Super excited for when this comes out.
Yeah i can already smell it where the main male hero will as usual get depowered, nerfed, sidelined, devalued etc etc for most of the show.
Seems like this show is more like Teela and the masters of the universe instead of He-Man. But, it’s whatever. I’m sure this’ll be cool anyways.
WOW! My childhood hero has one hell of an upgrade
Not for me, I just hate this kinda of animation
Pls make it gay
Now I want Swat Katz too
Really looking forward to this, roll on 23rd July 2021.
God the voice casting is painful.  Whoever is doing Cringer isn't even trying.
Why does it seem the female is the lead role in he man
Please don't screw up My childhood favourite with wokeism and feminism Netflix.
Half-naked godly muscular men, zero cleavages or more shown skin on women. Also a buff chick with short hair included. Haha
Awesome, they are taking the original toy concept and bringing it into the show canon. For those that don't know, the Sword of Power was in two parts with the original toys.  He-Man and Skeletor both had one half.  Neither could unlock Castle Greyskull or gain it's powers without the other half.  So, He-Man losing his powers when the sword splits is 100% in canon logic. As for Teela, if He-Man is out of the picture, she has always been the 2nd in command.  She is the Captain of the Royal Guard, was trained by her adopted father Man at Arms, oh, and is the biological daughter of the Sorceress. Teela taking over for a depowered He-Man is also 100% in canon logic.  Such a shame you all have a "woman bad" mentality.
Plz dub in telugu
After years of wanting to see Kevin show that he knows what he's doing, he makes this dipshit children's series look epic! Finally
Hey, was that Mark Hamill?
Oh cool so he-man is the toxic man now and not the main character she is....
The sword split😐😑😑😑😑😑😑
woke pathetic crap
ග්‍රහමන්දිරයේ ආනුභාවයෙන්  මා හට බලය ලබා දෙනු මැනවී 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The 3k 👎 didn't have a childhood
This isn't real, the whole cast isn't genderbent or swapped, cant be a netflix original
He man die's !!!!! 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
*Tela is a skeptic, Eternia is in dire times, Cringer is talking sense, Skeletor knows it’s a beautiful day outside, and I still remember that childhood tune*
No.
"Still remember the tune?"  "Some things you never forget. ...My name is Oliver Queen."
Looks to girly.. like most stuff in 2021
Double trouble ⚔️ He-man !
ഗ്രെസ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നിൽ ഉറങ്ങുന്നാ ശക്തി  പുറത്തു വാ......  He-man   nostalgic item❤️😍😍
He-Man: "The sword of power is literally perfection"  Teela: "It will be....when it fits a woman" HERE I COMMMMEEE!!!!
Halfway through He-man is gonna become She-Ra and then evolve into they-them
W A T - skeletor.
Still remember the tune Nostalgia ❤️❤️❤️
The vibe of this trailer feels..... wrong.... idk its feels off
my childhood hero
RIP He-Man...
Bait and switch
The Revelation is simple,He-Man is now woke so he now identifies as a He-Woman. Thank's Netflix.
Intresting
Instead of teela as main character  they should have gone into He-man and She-Ra brother and sister dynamic
This seems good but I'm not going to forget the remarkable Reboot back in 2002. That was awesome!
Still waiting for transforners kindom
I'm both excited and worried, cause that new girl is looking more and more like the main character we'll be following Alot before we can see He-Man.   Let's just hope she's at least decent, and not a pandering "I am strong! I don't need a man in my life!" Even though no one asked her.
I will stick with Anime, all those woke crap getting OLD!
Netflix presents "HeMan -The anime" And I say Heeyayayayaya....
i hope this more MA rating...as most of the fans now in their 40s
why all girl look like man woke
Sooo Clownfish TV  was completely right about this being a He-Man show only in name. I have never seen the original series but I HATE when a main character gets sidelined for the sake of WOKE politics.  Clownfish TV deserves an apology  from Kevin Smith. The man used to be a genuine artist but now he's just another cog in the woke machine. What a  shame....  :-(
Better have the he man song, "hey"
Is Skeletor really He-Man's uncle, or was that invented by Keith Giffen and James Robinson?
Wat?
Can you watch this as a new viewer?
Yeah, no.  This woke crap has GOT TO GO!  Cancelling my Netflix subscription.
she-man and the woketards of the universe
Oooooooo goosebumps 💪⚔️
My children will turn gaaaaay
Is look like the title should be "Ileena and He-Man".
If he doesn’t say “BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL” I’m out straight away…and if it centres around Teela as the star I’m out…I don’t want my memories of my childhood watching this ruined
What!
Awesome. My heart beats ♥️
So, everything that Clownfish was saing?
90s kids know this hero closely 😍😊
They Could Have Upgraded his Wolly Under Pants 🤓😆
Woki and now She-Man. What's next GI-JANE?!
Isn't it he man ?? Where's his lion ???
If his transformation isn't epic then it ruins it for me. You gotta have a big brave voice "by the power of grey skull! 'HE-MAN!' I HAVE THE POWER!"'
Looks like a whole lot of someones owes Clownfish an apology, starting with silent bob....
Iyee He-Man....!
Can you guys add The Batman back again it’s my favorite Batman series
Same animation style as DC Animated movies/series.
Teela: "Still remember the tune?" Pepperidge Farm Remembers
Where is the tiger
The first trailer a few weeks ago was  a real bait and switch, if this is the crud we're getting.
BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, HE HAS THE POWER!!!!!
1:04  Namaari from "Raya and the Last Dragon", very creative approach in destroying the Teela character image for Fans.
" BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!!"
Cersei Lannisters voice?
The two biggest revelations:  1 - Clownfish TV was right AGAIN.  2 - Kevin Smith is full of shit.
so kevin smith lied?
This He-Man series looks 🔥 I grew up watching it! Thanks Netflix!😁
Ye he man he na dosto
Ah SHE-MAN
HE-MAN ... என்னுள் இருக்கும் சக்தியே 😯😯😯 ... சூரப்புலி எங்கடா 🤣🤣
I can hear Cersei
I have watched he man the beginning part 1,2 and 3. Am I supposed to watch something else in order to understand the movie's timeline and plot?
Man At Arms "The Sword of Power is perfect." Teela "It will be, when it is in the hands of a woman"
Greascal kottayude shakthi 😌
Spot-on.. can't wait to watch
So, the rumors were true, He-Man really is taking a back seat. On a side note Chris Pratt's new movie, is amazing though.
Teaser was great but based on the trailer this turns out to be yet another piece of woke BS.
why are women dressed like men??
The moment he-man is pushed aside or it goes woke im out 👍👍👍
I hope this doesn't have any gay characters!!
Is his sister She-Ra in this?
they should have much more revealing clothing for women!!
No.
He man
So hyped they actually got Sarah Jessica Parker to play Prince Adam
Just thanks. Finally Masters of the Universe gets the treatment this awesome brand deserves. And somehow this is just the beginning! 🤩
She-Man!
She-Man and the mam's of the universe
This is everything.
But, where is ORKO?
Good Job Netflix.... i'm actually looking forward to this.
Actually, this is a genius move. He-man is the alter ego because the Sword bestowed him that power, give that sword to a more capable fighter....🤔
Childhood vibe ☑
where is the german cross on his chest????
You already know this is going to suck. Boycott it.
Holy shit these animations are so clean af 🔥
1:53 goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥 the first super hero in my life
"Gölgelerin gücü adına" diyeceksin, He-man diyeceksin, Titrek bey diyeceksiniz. Orijinalinden iyi olan çeviriler bunlar.
So…it’s gonna be she man?
F**k it man!!!!  This show is called He-Man!!!!  Not f***ing Teela with a woke feminist haircut!!!!
I loved Skeletor's nasal laughter and his funny insults....I hope they keep that in this one.
and i say...
I've seen enough, time to head back to  Anime...
Hope it’s not another woke piece of garbage
He-man's face is funny
so i guess its going to be sh-maam from here on out?
Just want everyone wanted lmao a side character from he man show. 🤣🤣🤣🤣can’t stand this woke garbage
Bring the 'Centurions' back too...!!
Trans- Teela adventures. Passing.
damn why do we have to wait until the end of the month though?!
Turns out kevin Smith was lying all along 🤣
This middle aged white lesbian demographic Hollywood is obsessed with appealing to doesn't exit.
What’s going on?
wtf anime?
For those who are worried. Still to early to know what the plot is. Remember, Teela is the biological daughter of the sorceress and will eventually become the sorceress herself though she doesn't know it yet.It's possible that's what this trailer was hinting at.
I think the story is a god mix of all the characters,.. Something like QUEST FOR ETERNIA. i love it.
If Kevin Smith ruins this! I hope somebody restores He-man (2002) animated series where it left off!
you put sword in like that and you are going to have a bad day
There's enough saltiness in these comments to season my meals for a month.
Sooo... is He-Man even a main character?
Gonna be bad but I'm gonna be here for it cause I'm a sucker.
Great, Teela is not allowed to look like a female anymore... I really don't want to hate this... I still have a little bit of hope that this is not about fulfilling an agenda...
Adam: All I know is I picked up the sword and then WHOOSH!! I’m in a Loin Cloth!
He man
This looks beautiful. I hope you old 80s whiners shout up soon. As long as He-Man will be still in the game and the main later on all is good, just wait and see before you dislike everything beforehand.
Nostalgic
He-Man is white??
What is this garbage they did to Teela?  A half shaven head and man arms?   This is not giving me hope for the series
Hard pass.
Hopefully Orko is transgendered and Cringer is non binary.
Huge He-man fan of old. Teela’s revised costume says it all. The title even omits He-mans name, was and should be He-man and the masters of the universe. I’ll give it a pass and rewatch the 2002 series, they were amazing.
Thank you Netflix looks fun!
A female main character...enough said.
Teela show sure looks great
The background music is lit af! 😳🔥
i am confused is this show about He-Man or Teela?
We get to see the story of Adora's Twin! I'd love to see at some point a crossover episode of the two, would be interesting.
Mark Hamill as Skeletor? sign me up.
So I guess they didn't name it He-man Masters of the Universe because he's been demoted to a side character now or am I wrong?
Damn
90s kid ❤️
I hope each episodes end with some moral value lessons like back in the good old days.
Maybe. Most definitely sailing the seas to see. 😎
He-Man...he's Back🙌
It's been done. MOVE ON TO A NEW SERIES/ORIGINAL IDEA NETFLIX.
He-man sidelined, but it could still be good. Really hate that Teela's shaveed side hair and bitchy face. Why can't they make more likable badass females like they did in the old days.
I would’ve watched this if it was named teela or some ish tired of these bait and switches
Se imaginan una serie así pero de Mortal Kombat?😍
ഇത് കൊച്ചു ടീവിയിലെ ഹി മാൻ അല്ലെ 😂

Meh doesn’t interest me and it from mr cry over everything such a fake ass dude
அந்தநாள் ஞாபகங்கள்!!!!🛀🛀🛀
ഗ്രെസ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി
OK, so, I'm guessing this is a 2 pt movie?  Or is it a series? (continuation it looks like)
So hyped and they finally gave my boy skeletor some true power I am so excited to see one of my favorite if not favorite character come back all hail SKELETOR!!!!!
The Wokness rumors where correct, canceling subscription now.
where is his tiger?
maybe part 1 is the teela show to tick all the woke boxes and to appease woke executives and then part 2 will finally be the actual master’s of the universe where he-man is the central character
where's the damn He-Man song?
First teaser: 10/10. Trailer implying He-man won’t be the main character: 1/10.  This seems to be “She-Male: Masters of the Woke Universe”
she-woman ?
Why is Teela fighting on par with He-man? If they are going to share the sword thats stupid. She-ra already exists.
Hey it’s He-Man
Yes She's none other than Lena Headey. Noticed voice of Cersei the moment she started to speak 🔥
I'm going to bet on Clownfish TV over Kevin Smith.
Please no woke propaganda on this series
You bait everyone with the first trailer with it being he-man centered and then do a switcheroo
Al fin se viene una nueva versión de Iván el trolazo!
I had action figures of almost all of them. All lost as time passed..... 80s were good
i saw this when it was called castlevania
Lol, they're really pushing Teela as the main Feminist character. Looks like she'll babysit Adam throughout the majority of the series in order to save Eternia.
So next season will titled She-Woman and the Mistress of the Universe? :-D ..... wait that didn't sound right. :-P
This looks horrible. Get mad at me now, but you'll agree later.
So how many ABCDEFG characters here?
I am the POWER !  He-Man !
They literally probably won’t call him He-Man once because in today’s age, being a he or a man is apparently offensive… Even powered up they’ll probably just call him Adam.
OMG it took me back to my teen days when thr whr limited shows for kids like Jane Robot . HEMAN was my most favourite now i will watch it with my teen son.
Damn. Guess He-Man is gonna be a side character in his own show. Can't wait to watch *Teela: Mistress of the Wokeness Revelations*
Teelas voice is everything!!!
Team Skeletor!
Daaaammm straight homie
Oh so it's not a remake 😕
This looks so good...but why does Teela look so basic? Like, the designers or Netflix are afraid of feminine strong women? You have to make her look like a man to be strong? Not sure it's a great message. I'll give it a chance though since the voices give me chills and I LOVE what they did with Teela's old design in the flashbacks (?). Beastman, He-Man, Skeletor and the rest look great!
Wow🙂👍🗡️
Another reboot, Another disappointment.
Waiting 😍
Bout to watch Tela go toe to toe with Heman and wash him .... smh
the thing is robot chicken trolled these characters so bad that now I can't take them serious
If they wanted a strong female lead, why Teela? What was wrong with She-Ra if they wanted female representation. She could have come back to help her brother out, I don't have anything against Teela per say - but people want to see the "most powerful man in the universe" or ya know, his sister who's also epic - not prince Adams body guard doing pathetic battle cries when 90% of the time she needed to be saved by the actual hero.
please dubbed tamil ❤️❤️
Man, this is so clearly confusing.
The name of the show is Tee-La
. F . Yes I'm in ✌💯
i dunno man, i had a bad feeling about this..
Gooooosebums...!!!!!
I wish all Teela Na theorists a very good evening. I want Teela as a strong foil to Adam so. freaking. bad. Give me those complex relationships that I never would have appreciated as a kid. I know people will complain it's too woke but Teela was already a super interesting character for her rank and backstory. It makes sense that they chose an Adam design closer to the early 2000s version if they want to go the Teela/Adam foil route. I really don't think they can capture all that lightning in a bottle from my childhood, but this direction will hopefully be compelling. Thematically they have a lot to work with.
Did no one use Miracle Grow ???
He-him she-her master's of the universe. There is a good reason why this isn't called He-man: Masters of the Universe. This makes it easier to phase him out of the series into obscurity while pushing their politics and put Teela and her wah-men army with all their strong independent wah-men not needing a man and righting all the wrongs of toxic masculinity while being held back by men even though they are shown to superiors in every way and could never be controlled by men but have been anyways been oppressed. Kevin Smith is a giant hypocrite. Kevin Smith is a deflated emaciated liar. It would all be fine, if the story was actually not a piece of crap story that force fed their politics so blatantly.
He man ❤️
Yaar iska name Masters of the Universe nahi balki Heman Hona chaiye tha😁😄 Par koi nahi MAST tha trailor
oh boy it's happening again
Man .... did I just turn 5 years old again? 😉
This is a disgrace. An insult. Why take a legacy and tarnish it on purpose. He-Man is now She-Man.
Regardless what they do with the plot, they have ruined Teela as a character.
So, He Man is emasculated by not being able to get his muscle on and has to be saved by Teela? Sooo 2021! Having said that I’m going to reserve judgement till release, but…
Oh sweet. The return of the most badass gay man ever....HE-MAN!!!!
Something you can never forget “ I have the power”🔥
I never thought I would ever see a haircut that actually makes a mullet look good.
Okay Netflix think fast!  Money? Or Twitter Points?
He-Man is hardly going to be in this. Adam is going to be the bumbling sidekick, and Cringer is a philosopher?  Oh this is going to be really bad, and I don't mean that in a good way. Kevin Smith, you need to stick to Mall Rats comedy bs. I think I'm going to be sick 🤢
My First Super Hero..❤️
Yes to save enternia not eternia 0:34
I'm the power. That give me goosebumps.
My childhood love
Still know the tune? Is she referring to the tune she would never have heard, having been kept in the dark about Adam being He-Man, or some other tune, perhaps a song they sung as children?
This looks spot on. Stop crying just cos a woman is one of the leads ya bunch of virgins.
*Single tear...*
Netflix you ruined Adams fight in record of ragnarok now your doing this wow Netflix this basterd I hate Netflix man.
So Hemans new title these days is he/she/them/they,/gender fluid /person?
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Don't be fooled, this is most definitely going to be some WOKE BS! This isn't He-mans story it focuses on Heela there just using He-man in the trailer to draw in the fans. Just like they did with TLOU2 using Joel in the trailer
Nope
We can only watch if it's a he man show
Awesome! Now Thundercats and SwatKats toooo please!
Did these fuckers really skip showing Battlecat?! 😕
Cringers voice was terrible...
Tamil Dubbed The series 🤗🤗🤗...
If heman is not the main face of this animation.....we the fans....will riot
ഗ്രേസ്ക്കൽ കൂട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നുള്ളിലൊതുങ്ങി വാ ശക്തി കൂടിവാ 🔥🔥🔥
I get it, Snow-white is NOT white, and HE-MAN is NOT man.
The ready look adventitiously mug because fairies interspecifically preserve vice a lean comfort. unbecoming, tacit rule
With buffy as teela? I'm in.
The old signature tune of he man is equally important…you cannot ignore that if you really want to bring back HE MAN after 40 years…
I’ve never even watched the original series so I’m really excited about this one
This looks pretty cool 😁🥰
He - Woke and the masters of the unisex
SJW politics even made it into a show called HE-MAN… which they removed. Stop destroying our childhood!
Looks nice, but why oh why did they give Teela the Wehrmacht haircut?
Even He-man is now about a woman. FFS 🙄
Notmyheman
I still don't like the design of the classic he-man sword.
F U Kevin Smith 🤮🤮🤮
I swear if this is another lgbtq women power I will cancel Netflix
Kevin Smith owes clownfish tv a big apology
So the Teela show, hard pass.  Better luck next time Kevin.  Good animation but what I've seen here in this trailer, I'm out.  Next time get a better script, same animators and you'll do better son.  It's like EA decided to make He Man, looks good bad story, but don't worry its pretty.
I believe some woke shit has spoiled this.
I just realized something...the mark on He-Man's chest is shaped like an "H."
After watching this trailer I'm convinced that they should rename it to Masters of the Universe: Teela or Teela and the Masters of the Universe
Hell yeah!!
Waiting for in Hindi
This seems like Japan Animation style, reminds me of thundercats
Yo Kringer sound like that dude that asks for salt packs at McDonald's..lol..not feeling his very human voice...its He man and the Masters so I will get over it.
bait & switch........ so the rumors were true. ClownfishTV was rigth.
Pathetic.....no where near the original one.....more Anime less emotions .....
Watching this made me feel like a kid again.  Pretending He-Man had turned evil and Teela had to shave the side of her head and save everybody... good times.  They even have the robot guy.  I remembered that, and I clapped.
So He-Man would be sidelined for some lame ass women power shit....Thanks for saving my time....MOTU is He-Man not some other person its not the same without him
People must complain..if it is good it is good.
Shouldn´t He-Man be the protagonist?
Talking gringer wtf did they do to heman
Make movie in 3D...will more enjoyable
1:50 "Still know the tune?" "Some things you can never forget." *Proceeds to sing **_What's Up?_** by the **_4 Non Blondes_*
<\\\ SO MUCH FANTASTIC AND COOL EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>>>>>>>
The YouTube channel Clownfish was  right! Go check them out.
2002 He-Man had a better transformation.   This one looks like it's a Sailor Scout transformation sequence.   I really, really, really hope this show will do more than just look good artistically cuz giving "fans" a show that sidelines the character we all really want to see to play up the bench warmers isn't a great way to get us into the show.
I remind my childhood days
Wow why does Teela look like an sjw Butch? Yuck.
So Clownfish TV was right! Why is there this fu#*ing obsession to make a woman look like a man?!!! Someone has a serious case of penis envy and I think that someone is Kevin Smith.
I'd get a netflix subscription for this, but I don't want a streaming service that *also* supplies softcore speedo pron.   If they make a public statement and dump streaming QT's I'll sign up.
Teela: "Still remember the tune" Prince Adam: "Some things you never forget" "In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days"
Never so hyped up about He-Man since He-Man
I love how so many people on this thread have already seen the show and have decided they are already disappointed. Good grief. People are not happy with ANYTHING nowadays. I grew up with this show and thus far am thrilled with what I'm seeing. Looking forward to seeing the ACTUAL SHOW WHEN IT AIRS.
Come on Netflix just do it give us thunder cats!! 🔥
He man really looks out of place and I'm not sure why
wokey tokey he sheman
I love it when the notification shows up, "Someone Likes your comment" and "you have a new Subscriber".....
I love it when the notification shows up, "Someone Likes your comment" and "you have a new Subscriber".....
Oh no, Kevin.  It was true.  All of it.
Adora must meet her bother: Adam!
I love it when the notification shows up, "Someone Likes your comment" and "you have a new Subscriber".....
He-man is pretty steak and beer as far as stories go.  Skeletor pulls some wise guy plan, then Adam powers up and kicks his ass.  Very simple premise.  All it needed was some updated animation.  One thing it didn't need was adult nuance and themes of failure and sacrifice.  I liked the Last Jedi too, but Jeez, does every hero from the 80's now need to be a burnout failure incapable of acting alone?
So the rumors are true. We get He-man in the 1st episode and the rest of the series is about Teela going full Butch and being the hero. Screw you Netflix and Kevin Smith.
Childhood is Back
Hell. Yeah.
Please make CAPTAIN PLANET
Hey, Kevin Smith you said this is the sequel to the '80s cartoons but why does Teela looks so decades older than Adam in this? They are almost of the same age in the original series. Furthermore, Teela is a compassionate person which is why she is beloved by many, your version seems too bitchy
You better not side step the main  man
Such good animation wasted once again for some left-winged, liberal agenda.
Plz dubb this series in Hindi
"I'm not about to let a He-Man take credit for a he-woman's work" - Teela
Argh! The leaks where true. Prepare to have he-man be sidelined completely in his own reviva series in favor of strong wamen Tesla. Kevin smith thought he could pull a bait an switch again, but some of us caught on earlier on.
They're trying to focus on the ladies but He-Man has all the cool scenes lmao!
I don't understand... They already remade She-ra right??? I thought this was supposed to be a He-Man remake... F off with all this gender politics stuff... Prince Adam looks way too effeminate. Man... I was excited for He-man (and Mark Hamill). I don't think the show's a bad idea in reality, but you really f'ed up with your advertising and building hype. Show it off to be a He-man remake while In truth it's going to be the Teela show. I am upset. I'm upset AND disappointed. This is not the way.
Let's please all appreciate the layers and layers of references happening here... The sword split in two, like the original toy line. The appearance of Stinkor, the lone toy character who didn't get featured in the filmation cartoon. The cute little reference to that impossibly catchy theme song. The unapologetic approach to the transformation sequence. Etc... This show really did its homework! For everyone panicking about about Teela being the main character, I don't see it. There are three distinct female voices in the trailer; it's not all Teela. The opening narrator, I assume, is The Sorceress. And the "risk I'm willing to take" line appears to be a new character. He-Man gets the badass "everyone will die" line, Adam gets inspirational lines, Skeletor gets the focus at the climax of the trailer, even Cringer gets a dramatic speech, and He-Man himself still gets the final moment. This looks like an ensemble cast approach, which is totally valid.
Quite similar to She Ra Reboot Story...
She-man mistress of the universe 😂  The level of bait and switch is over 9000
It's like Man of Steel of Superman, so like He-man:Origins , so hyped for my childhood series
Based on the trailers released so far, I can guess how the plot plays out: -He-Man and Skeletor face each other in a major battle, which ends with the Power Sword being split in two and Eternia losing its magic. Prince Adam is no longer able to transform into He-Man. -Teela learns that Adam was He-Man. She's angry that Adam didn't tell her the truth and leaves her position as captain of the royal guard.  -Teela later learns that the Power Sword has to be restored to revive Eternia's magic and save the universe. She joins forces with Adam and other former friends and foes. -At some point Skeletor becomes more powerful and Adam becomes He-Man again.
Never been into he man masters of the universe world, but damn internet alr ruined my view for this dude with the parody HEAYEAYEAYEA video, and i can only see this muscular guy as a gay with stylish blondie hair with an appetite to bang the villains the gay way.... Thanks 9gag and internet
Netflix, I thank you for this, Voltron, DOTA, and Castlevania. I hope you will make a remake of Thundercats, GI Joe erc.
looks nothing like he-man, please stop with this old stuff and make new shows that new generations will call their own.
Bait and switch. This isn’t a He-Man show. It’s a Teela show. Lies and deception. Screw Netflix and Kevin Smith.
Adam looks very effeminate and Teela looks very masculine. It also seems like it has a lot more to do with Teela and not so much He-Man. This isn't the He-Man I grew up watching and I don't think this is going to be very good, but I like Kevin Smith so I'm holding out hope.
Finally, after 40 years, He-Man fans get what they've been clamouring for..   Teela wearing trousers!
Get Woke, go Broke.
When did Teela become a buff dude? The “Mental Illness Haircut” in her redesign tells me all I need to know about where this disaster is going. Thanks for warning.
Ah yes, they-man
We don’t care bout this where is the on my block season 4😭
I hope this show fails. Netflix is garbage and we can all see what they are doing with this loved ip
He-man is better off dead to the world than being in this series. Kevin smith is a hollywood hack now.
so majic is life just like in the shera rebote. cool
Something off about this trailer , I don't know how to put it , I am a fan of this cartoon series , I watched it in my Telugu language . BGM is one the best . But what I see in this trailer the real BGM , that itself tells show is going to bomb. Prince Adam is too much lean , and and even He-Man also . They look much worst ,compared to old and even 2002 He-Man is far more better. Still wanted to see the show ,but now I am almost 66.66% doubtful that I might not like this one. Too much music , voices are lees impactful compared to old ones , I don't know who is Teela here , she is one ugly looking character that I have seen in He man series. I don't what the makers are thinking in their mind. Might be drinking while drawing these .  SIMPLY PUT TRAILER IS LITERAL DEFINITION OF UGLY . TEASER AMD TRAILER ARE LIKE SKY AND THE EARTH.  ON SECOND THOUGHT , NAH , I  am OKAY with the 2002 version .
Teela Man
I watched He Man all episodes when i was kid on cartoon network in hindi language. Nostalgia when he says  "I HAVE THE POWER"
Well, we can now clearly see this is a Teela show. Be ready to see Teela defeating faker with both her legs tied up.
The ol' bait and switch..... Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology
Bad character designs, flat voice acting.  I'll pass
So, Clownfish TV was right...
Is it available in tamil language
Where is the song "I Need A Hero"? I was waiting for it to play along
Thanks for ruining one more show.
I totally miss the original BGM..
Should have called this series Teela and the Masters of the Universe since he-man is not even going to be the main character in his own series.
Felt so much nostalgic 😌
I see a lot of complaining. But I guess everyone forgot Teela is the sorceress' daughter and meant to take her place
0:24 who is this man?
I like that there's people essentially saying "They don't focus on Iron Man enough in this Avengers movie!" Funny af.
Hindi dubbed plzzzz
This looks like She - Ma'am and the power of my unshaven legs.
the shera reboot was amazing so i hope this one would also be good
So Kevin Smith did a complete 180 after calling out people on twitter months ago??
All Hail skeletorrrrrrr
Need a Thunder cats reboot
This is where the pendulum swings back to stupidism.
Sword got divided so teela getting the other half definitely
I'm sure the story is great and all, but I'm so tired of this crappy, cheap-looking animation style. It's whatever, I guess. We're stuck with it.
Excuse me, can someone tell me who is the main character of this show? 😒
It doesn't look international standards...looks like the same animation which was used 30 years back
Gave me robot unicorn vibes guys
Magic gave birth to pronouns. And gayskull rills it all
Looks like Kevin Smith owes ClownfishTV an apology.
This is looking like the Teela show and if that’s the case, it will be a hard pass. All I don’t need is another woke shit ruining the good things from my childhood.
I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Prince Adam looks like Princess Adam and Teela's hairstyle is in line with today's edgy Feminists. Netflix show indeed.
Hard pass, like 99% of everything else from Hollywood lately.
A small part of me hopes this is somehow connected to the shera spinoff, but let's be honest.  It definitely isn't.
Mark Hamill as Skeletor is a dream come true!!!
Wait...did they make she-ra a red head?
I see why they aren't calling it He-Man anymore.
Really Gen X, are we actually going to allow them to ruin everything?
Arnold Schwarzenegger' voice for Heman!!!!
Fvrt animated series of childhoods
Looks like they’re pulling a bait and switch. Glad I didn’t grow up with He-Man or else I’d be very disappointed
Pls pls Tamil dubbed
What criminal edited this? I had to look away as all of the cuts were giving me a headache. Massive step down in hype from the excellent "Holding Out for a Hero" trailer.
This looks badass I can’t wait
XXX: "BEHOLD! The Lord of Destruction!" ME: Baal. Is that you?
At least the animation isnt crap!  Why did they screw with She-ra SO much?  I didn't care that it was woke (I thought  it was cool) but they made fun of the original fans and show and that was effed up.
So Teela might actually become Woman-At-Arms. Points to anyone that remembers that line. 😂
Oh boy  I think Kevin Smith owes a channel an apology
Oh boy  I think Kevin Smith owes a channel an apology
We need to make this rated R series, with more violence, adult language and nudity.  Unlike batman only scare the bad guys, Heman need to use brutal force to beat the monster til they r scared of the heroes, like omniman gives them a real beatdown.
I really wish this felt better than is does.
Tamilla dubbed pannuga da
Curious to see how the left butchered it
I thought it strange why they put the Dolph Lundgren film on Tv, now I know why.  Kinda looks the same but it sounds different from the 80s. How old is He-Man in this cause 80s He-Man sounded like an adult.
As a lifelong MotU fan who loved each and every incarnation of the Franchise (okay, the grimdark DC reboot maybe not so much at first but it grew on me) including the recent awesome She-Ra reboot I'm absolutely looking forward to this - especially if Teela takes over the lead. I always found He-Man a bit boring and was more a fan of all the side characters (with my favorite characters being Sorceress, Teela, Blade, Extendar, Flipshot, Hydron, Rio Blast and Man-at-Arms). And I usually like new approaches to established franchises/properties.
Yeah, by all accounts it's a 'bait and switch' where they lure you in with the promise of a He-Man show and you get an SJW feminist Teela leading a 'diverse' cast for 90% of the series. *sighs*
Bait and switch. Pass.
Wowwww
ഗ്രേസ് കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി എന്നുള്ളിൽ ഒതുങ്ങുമാ ശക്തി കൂടി വാ....😌😌😌
Adam looks really wimpy.  Hopefully its not going to be a theme that he's a guy who's been handed everything, and is nothing without the sword and crown. In the originals Adam was buff and brave in his own right but played the fool to hide his identity as He-man.
This is He-Man or Teela show beacouse Im confused???
Is He-Man gone from Eternia?  Is Teela the main character?  Is Kevin Smith a liar?
I don't know why I had any hope that Netflix wouldn't turn this into another progressive female empowerment story, while deconstructing and humiliating the titular male character.
Dude Teela is more muscular than Adam,LOL and with the hair cut like that clearly there is a message being sent, just not sure what it is.
As long as the Moss-man figure is still scented then we're good.
He-man
வணக்கம்🙏
Mantaaab he-man muncul lg,d jaman gw SD ini film kartun favorit 😍👍👍
The only one missing in the trailer is man at arms. Wonder if they killed him off or neutered him.
I would like to know if this story really about He-Man or is he de-powered most of the series?
Looks like they did pull the switch on us.
You need a Redo of the healer.
He-Man
Get Woke Go Broke...
Looks like Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology.
Cersei Lannister doing the narration?
People need to go back and watch the original, to see how awful He-Man was as a character, you need to nerf him so the show can have drama, an actual story to tell. I don't get what's the problem with having Teela in the spotlight, the show is called Masters of the Universe, not He-Man
Mark Hamill's voice oh my god
I think I'm just going to re watch the original series.. you cant ruin whats already been made Kevin Smith
Is this a series about an ugly man in an underwear & bra like armor fighting monsters ? As a castlevania fan I'm not interested
From now on 23rd July will be called "He-Man Day"
Let see what you plan Netflix....you know what gonna happen if this mass up. lol
oh look we were right all along... this is a woke trash show afterall
It's supposed to be "He-Man and the masters of the Universe!" I didn't hear "He-Man"  one time in this trailer? Another Woke trailer of a classic. :(
I hope Adora/Shera is in it
I SAID HEYYYYY WHAT'S GOING OOOOOOOOOON
I see what they are doing here, the name of the original show was, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, now they just removed He-Man's name and made it all about Teela. Maybe they should call it, Teela and the Masters of the Universe and see how people react to it. They better prepare themselves.
Teela has a Karen haircut 😑
oooh did I just hear Cersei Lannister??
The more I see of this the more I’m afraid all the traditional stuff will just be an episode and the rest of the show will be “The Teela show” with Adam pushed to the side, shit on or both.
sahiiiiiii
dont we have sheerah, why are they making heman about teela?
My my
It's like they made Die Hard 3 and John McLane's wife was the main character.
0:43 it's 2021, gives He-Man a sheath or something. That is the most dangerous way to stow your magic sword. He could an hero himself. This is so cringy.
Tamil dubbed pannuga please 🙏
i thought this was a heman cartoon netflix.  None of the original music or spirit of the old show horrible. Glad I cancelled my netflix months ago.
"Being a hero...swallows your hole" 😂
I want original tune to be played here
big time rush
Skeletor looks crazy as🔥
Any  Tamil fans for this movie???
I already know Mark Hamill is gonna be the best Skeletor.
HE MAN !!!!😁
Now if Netflix can get the ball rolling on Thundercats my childhood will be re-imagined
Kevin Smith, one word .. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
This show looks great if you're a fan of female bodybuilding. Teela's arms....just wow!
Can't wait for it. Please  Netflix release it in hindi language also 🙏🙏
Teela and The Masters of the Universe........    ....Nope! Don't like it!
Just thinking of the original and Prince Adam holding aloft the magic sword and saying "I have the power" gives me goosebumps. This N version is meh.
What did they do to Teela!?!?
Wow
First trailer was 🔥  this makes me want to skip it.
The Revelation is that He Man is not even the star of his own show. XD
Wish the music was of the old!
DC Animated Universe Vibes!
Antes se inventaban peinados creativos, siento que ya estan usando la mitad rapada demasiado.
I have the power 😍😍😍 HE MAN 😍
Not looking what they're doing with Teela I must admit, from her personality to her later look. Everything else seems cool though. Judgement reserved until final product.
Can't wait for the Teela show. XD
Teela with steroids xdd
Castlevania,Trese and now this Netflix is doing next level thing
Teela looked do pretty now they had to make her look like an SJW 🤦🏻‍♂️
The music already sold me 🔥
The first trailer was so hype but since then I've heard concerning rumors about He-Man not being the man character, rumors which this trailer seems to corroborate because it is framing Teela as the main character.  I'll have to see the actual show before I make up my mind but I am concerned.
I can see the propaganda here, teela is going to be the lead.  To hell with netflix.
Don't like Teela design here!
Thank you Kevin Smith -_-
Animation and voice acting looks good... yeah that’s all I gotta say that’s positive to be honest.  But let me get this straight, the story isn’t about He Man even though the whole point of the series is that He Man loses his powers? Instead the story is focused on Teela for some reason even though Prince Adam should be the focus? I mean he’s someone that has to deal with the reveal of his secret identity and the fact that he’s now powerless and now has to find other ways to prove himself and be strong, you know? But nope let’s give it to Teela because she’s the leader and she’s the only one who can bring everyone together and save Eternia!!! In fact let’s make her the next Sorcereress and also give her the sword of power right? Jesus Christ both the original Teela and the one from the 2002 reboot were such kick ass characters and they didn’t need to take the place of the male lead in order to stand for herself! Pro feminist writing has become such a hypocritical joke, well at least Japan is still kicking pop culture’s ass with anime.
It's he man not masters of universe
I grew up watching he-man and she-ra in the 80's, and this looks good so far!!!
The first trailer was great. This one, I'll be waiting for more details, or even after the show starts. Tho I'm near the exit while waiting.
This is still sus af. Is this even about He-Man anymore??
My favourite since childhood! This brought in so much to reminiscence
I already know this will bomb.  They took the exquisitely drawn women of the 80s Filmation series, and turned them into muscular androgynous 'she-men'.
I notice he-man is not the main character in the trailer.
Teela looks like a man and this trailer over looks pretty shitty compared to the first one. You guys lost me. The character resign on teela and the race swapping/wokeness is just annoying at this point. I hope it fails so we can get a real he-man.
Oh dang, this drops on my birthday, too! Neat!
so, the rumors were true
Wanna see a dark more powerful skeletor
Looks like some feminist cartoon and not He-Man.
He-man 😎thalaiva 😂
Feminine women character is blasphemy nowadays, they want to change women into a man. fuckin wierd stuff
childhood back❤️❤️
Everyone knows he-man not going to be the star of his own show 🤦‍♂️
Wait the tiger can talk!!
So the show is about Teela in the end??? Because it was said it wouldn't be about Teela. Liar liar netflix. 😒
Not me crying at Battlecat
1:32 - Is that The Shaping Staff?
I just want season 2 of son of zorn
Please stop linking a small planet's death as the death of whole effin universe. That made me lose interest completely.
He man ഗ്രൈസൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി❤️
Relived my childhood
She-Ra crossover when?
Where's Mayan..I don't know his other name😅
What Power?
In the 80s, they drew the women to look like women.  Now, the women are muscular androgynes that shave the sides of their heads.  Fail.
Like old days, afternoon break
how funny they made the appearance  of Adam & Tila..... lol
90's kids - like
The HOLY MEME LORD 1:38
Even the trailer looks cool
Ummm okay. The previous Trailer was simply Marvelous. Not much goosebumps on this one. They disclosed the entire plot.
What. No spin off sequel for She ra?
Look morons . Whether this series is woke or not , the people drawing it and writing it are obviously very talented and it’s gona be great no matter what
Tamil la When Release
This will not be true to He-Man or his universe. This will be a deconstruction of every beloved character. Don't watch. This show does not need the ratings.
Jeff's kiss 😉
Where is the I have the power scene, where is our childhood He man
Please continue this series 🥲
Cringer talks?
Maria uh maria ih mariah oh oh oh
I'm rooting for SHE-RA.
My back hurts looking at the thumbnail
Hell yeah
Why is it that I’m getting goosebumps thinking about the possibilities of this franchise if done right? I thought I put my days of He-Man behind me as a kid and now this… just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
Teela looks fantastic, a real athlete.
Is That Indiana Jones?
Ivan el trolazo
Whats with Teelas hair?
So Teela is the main character...?
And to think I almost let the negative toxic fanboys get into my head the last few days with their "If He-Man isn’t…blah blah blah" like stfu already ya whingy losers. Just enjoy and stop needing to be so combative over every damn thing.   Yeah I’m sorry but this looks AWESOME! I love the idea of magic disappearing and there being a quest to not only restore it but to repair the Sword of Power too. I mean who doesn’t enjoy a good quest. And it actually makes perfect sense for it to be Teela too and most probably Prince Adam as being the characters to go on said quest. She’s always been the female lead on the show and was basically right below He-Man in terms of of main characters, in fact the trio of He-Man, Teela and Orko is how I remember most episodes, the other Masters were "special guest stars" (except the 2002 series where they were regulars). I’m really excited for this now!
I'm gonna wait until someone reviews it to watch. Netflix is making me regret my subscription.
Why lie about this Kevin? Why? If you just said that Teela is the main character and she will be getting the lesbian haircut, the backlash would be less.
Hindi dubbed plz
Teela and Prince Adam were of almost same age. But in this series (which states it takes place after 40 years), Prince Adam looks like baby in front of Teela.. how's that's possible ? BTW, I am fan of He man but this one looks unsettling
The animation is incredible. But if you hear about the rumors and IF true it'll be a shame. Been a fan since the beginning.
So we can get a new meme?
Not watching the Teela show.
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
From "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" to "Masters of the Universe"...................... sooo, He-Man is a secondary character now.
🖕 That woke culture, is an miracle to see he man still white and straight 😂
So, Teela and the Masters of the Universe. Joy... another Netflix panderfest that will destroy an old show.
Tamil dudded
i smell wokeness...
When did Teela become a dude?
Please upload in hindi also i my old memory thanks Netflix india 🇮🇳
Omg.... Cant wait
Netflix made He Man feminist I hate it
Skeletor sounds like Shredder! (RIP James Avery)
Last of us 2 revelations... Hand Teela a golf club, " cus she don't need no man"!! We all know how this will play out. SMH.
Never watched He_man before, only know him through memes butt I'm hyped as hell for this series
Looks better than she ra
I knew it! They screwed it up!! It looks Adam took to much soy lattes….
If they pull a bait and switch, I'll be pissed. Lol
Teela and the Masters of the universe yas queen slay 🌈
Teela looking like Beau from The Mighty Nein.
Pls dub in tamil
Manh when he says.. I am the power.. entire cells in my body is feeling goosebumps 😍. The Prince of eternia
Holy shit this has me interested because I love the old-school He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe and this takes place afterwards so things should be really enjoyable
Hindi dubbed?
He-Man is back.  Yesssss baby
you know this is kinda sad and i expect more from kevin smith people called him out on the Teela show  he denied denied denied and in the official trailer for HE MAN i got to wait almost 40 second to see him  very sad indeed
I learned all my morality from He-Man in 1984. It has served me well.
Adam looks like an old lady to me... All the characters are changed here, it's obvious though...  But I'm with the old version ❤️❤️❤️ Beautiful Memories... Sorry Netflix, no offense... U carry on to boom your business by changing the Gold ones... It's kind of order of the day...
Was that...Cersei Lannister narrating?!
Sure, I'll give it a watch.
Used to watch this as a kid
In India?
Was it asking too much to have him say by the power of the universe? Like... come on bro.
If you want an exact replica of the original show, you will be disappointed, this isn't the 80's anymore. Stop living in the past,nothing is ever the same, regardless of how much  you want to please your nostalgia
Cringer talks!?
Saw that chics haircut a lot last night at a lesbian bar.   Skeletor was the only badass thing in this
I'm happily awaiting that section of the internet that is going to fly into a "why is this so woke!?!?" rage because Teela got an undercut.
Love that they kept the LGBTQ+ overtones    S2
This is the same story line from The Magicians show guys
"I Have the Poweeeeerr (in echo)"
Brought back my childhood memories... still waiting for A live action movie...🤟🏽
Remembered it was broadcast on cartoon network nd we  wait everyday to hear that same words 'the power of he maaaaaan'
Is this series canonically connected to She-ra in any way? I hope so, that would be awesome.
Why does Cringer and Adam sounds the same geees
I bet the "revelation" is that teela is the daughter of the sorceress and needs to take her place after she dies.
I hope this has minimal wokehood and CRT narratives. If it does then this is trash.
Ok, so it looks like the rumors were true. They really are going to side step the main character.
I want to like this... but it feels so cringe...
It’s funny how you never see an evil skeleton with bad teeth
Good
Did the cat always talk?
Pretty sure she has bigger balls than Adam too... SMDH
Admittedly its visually impressive, but let's really look at the trailer without blind nostalgia. Adam is boyish, and very effeminate, the voice acting on Cringer is cringe, and let's not pretend that after the first episode this series isn't going to go from He-Man to She-Man.
Teela has bigger arms than Adam!!! 🤣 this is trash! What's up with the UGLY AF half shaves haircut?! Man, you succeeded in messing up a cherished part of my childhood.  After I defended you. "He'd never go mainstream" welp. I shall eat my crow
🔥🔥
Its feels so good to finally cancel my subscription ClownFish TV was right! Animation is awesome but this is Luke Skywalker all over again!
Something is off. Hope it's good
Ngl the voices of the characters seems off here. Especially cringer's voice and skeletor's laugh.
Tamil la varuma
The internet is going to rename this "Memes of the Universe"
Pls issue this series tamil dubbed
I HAAAAVE THE WOMENPOWEEEER!!
uuuuuuuuuuuuu dividieron la espada, para quien sera....... huele a feminismo.... netflix... progresismo....
He-Man
F@#$ you, Kevin Smith, you stinking shill.  Nobody wants this woke BS, and you should be eternally ashamed.
My childhood favorite He-man & Thundercats too
It's, it's, it's... perfect...
What waste of a good franchise, fu wokemons
Of course he man couldn't even be the hero in his own show. We have to give it to the strong female protagonist.
:Still know the tune? :Somethings you can never forget. :HEYYEYAAEYEYAAEYAEYAA What’s going on
Hindi mai hsi
cringrer talking sucks
Hope they take notes from Castlevania  Also, why isn't He-man the MC anymore? It's not Teela and the masters of the universe.
Not watching this woke garbage. I want to watch a muscle bound dude in a loin cloth smack skelitor around. In not interested in ugly girls mooching off He-mans  name to appease Twitter. PASS.
Don't cry out loud
My only wish is the theme song, He Man will Not be the same if that catchy song is not glued to it.
Boooooo, I want heman not the Teela show
0:49 there's other barbarian HE-MEN 💪behind him, did anyone catch that!?.....is this and easter egg...this could change everything 👈
HEMAN
What's going on.......... and i say....
Tamil la dubbing pannuga...
Did uh, did Battlecat ever talk before or am I trippin'
Where is the classic music... Heee--Mannnn
I have the power
Poor Teela, what have you done to her.
a she ra teve que perde toda sua sensualidade por causa das feministas.  já o He Man tá até mais musculoso não? estou surpreso de ele continuar sendo loiro ainda. Esperava um he Man negro pra seguir a cartilha progressista doente de vcs. Apesar de saber que tudo em que vcs tocam apodrece. vou usar o meu Torrent pra dá uma oportunidade.
Thanks!!
Ha! Just like a woman.
The animation looks so good.. ❤️
Nice series Hindi dubbed osome Netflix
So he won’t cry sometimes when he lies in bed just to get it all out what’s in his head?
So... Kevin Smith is a liar. It IS the TEELA show. Colour me surprised.
This looks like that show my daughter watched she-ra, is this the guy version he-ra?
Kevin Smith stated he wasn't even a fan of He-Man. Can we please stop giving beloved I.P.'s to people who don't respect them?
1:06 Has Cringer ever spoken before?
Hindi dubbed
Woke much?
The original HE-MAN cartoon which I have seen in my childhood was awesome. Not sure about this.
This show going to suck real bad...
ok… This trailer just confirms more and more that the rumors are true… Netflix… If Teela ends being the main character…, no damage control will fix this… 🤷🏻‍♂️ Please don’t be the “The Last Jedi” of MOTU franchise… 🙏🏻🙄
So the sword is divided... because Teala has to wield it.... woke as fk.   And why bad English.  "Whatever happened to eternia " should be happens.
Only woke disliked this video because heman is powerful man
As long it isn’t some cultural propaganda to subvert HeMan’s role as protector of Eternia and his Value as a main character in a series literally named after him, I’ll be willing to give it a go.  Also it’s only been 20 years not 40, the 2002 reboot was and is still amazing!
I shows my childhood memories 😭😭🤧😍😍👉🤩👈
I'm looking forward to it, it'll be nice to meet all those characters again after so many decades.
He-man dosent look handsome, must have refer old animation series in that series HE-Man looked best
Comments section: 40% - This is going to be about Teelah? Nobody told us this! 55% - HEEEEEEEEEYYYYYEAYYYeaaaaayyah......
Looking forward to this. Rely looks great.
Glad they kept the sexy outfit
Whoever did the audio editing--- hey must need better headphones. Because damn.
It looks like they all know who HE-MAN is.
The secret of the sword is still better
Nyaaa, Beast Man, you furry fool! Come over here and grip my thighs, my oddly purple thighs.
Teela's adventures?
He mam to too too toouduuuu!!🎶🎶🎶 My child hood was awesome ❤️ hope it comes in tamil too
He-man better show those women whose boss!
I have ADVENTURE!!!!!
The male Teela is horrible. It’s weird how Hollywood wants to make female focused stuff and then they end up making them (females) look as masculine as possible.
so the leaks were true and it's all about Teela
This will be better than She-Ra In many ways
Lesbians are the universe, Teela's revelation.
In Hindi !
I really hope we will see Gwildor eating fried chicken and talking to cow.
İf you wish to make a Female Lead Series You Should Make "She-Ra". Ah sorry I forgot you screw this. Now you should screw that too Respect
Voice acting seems quite weak here. Hopefully while watching the show it comes across better.
Why does prince addam look like a chick i understand that its too make a noticeable difference for when he transforms but still and now that this trailer is out it really show what this story is about which is its about Lesbian redhead girl so im out not watching it
Everyone does know Netflix had zero decisions on this lol it was the lifelong fan and current owner of the toy company and the writers, Smith only directed and is the spokesman. Also quit whining before you watch it all that makes you seem is soft, wussy and all over a stupid cartoon. I like MOTU and I was more hyped seeing Stinkor honestly, i used to scratch n sniff prank people that toy as a kid for years lol
And we have plot.  I'm loving how the plot here actually harkens back to the lore that was included in the original toy line rather than sticking solely to the show's lore.
Oh shit this looks good!! This brings back childhood memories.  Cant wait
He-Man returns 😭🙀
Mostly targeted for 90's kids
TOO BAD HE-man gets sidelined in his own show
So you gonna give the spotlight to Not He-man, the guy who held this franchise for over 40 years on his back. Instead, your gonna give it to his girlfriend? Smart move, noooo one's going to be upset about that.
WTF
I only like Skeletor !
Imagine this in Anime style animation.
Sweet an He-Man anime,I'm in!
So He-man gets sidelined and Teela is the main character, exactly like Clownfish said and Kevin the liar Smith denied.  Pathetic.
Magic is gone from Eternia Star butterfly:This one is not on me this time. (Chuckles nervously)
Is this a prequel or a sequel to She-ra?
Teela looks like an ugly man in drag, no one cares about her or Kevin Smith and his blubbering sjw takes
wat
We want this in india in hindi dubbed
Netflix take my money, hell take my spleen while your at it.  I will be watching this.
Masters of the Universe Where Science ends... And Magic Begins!
In stores is skelegod. A skeletor with the power of He-man. Definitely, not spoilers
He - man 💥💥
All rumors and teaser+trailer+He-Man not in the title say one thing, here is another, backlash will be unpleasant, Netflix. I hope I am wrong but they are getting dumber by the minute.
So instead of HeMan, we get HyMen?
I said hey… what’s going on?
🔥🔥🔥
Still looks good so I hope it stays that way, really wish they gave Teela a less shitty haircut though. That’s my only complaint.
What is this dumpster fire? 🤦‍♂️  1:14  This should have been Adam facing He Man.   It makes for a far better story for Adam to learn to fight without power. To finally prove his worth to everyone.  Nah instead it's a Teela show.
Nostalgia hits as hard as that sword.
90 kid memories 🤟
Tamil dub Masters of the universe
He-man's secret identity is prince adam
It's gonna be horrible, total dissapointment.
Wasn't the power sword indestructible?
He-Man and the Mary Sues of the Universe
എവിടെ ഗ്രെസ്കൽ കോട്ട
Beautiful animation
Teela and the masters of the universe.
AMAZING WHAT THEY CAN CREATE FROM A FEW OLD TV TOY COMMERCIALS DONT YOU THINK? GONNA WATCH IT ANYWAY BUT I WILL BE DISSAPOINTED IF HE MAN DOES NOT GIVE ME MY LAST MINUTE ADVISE EVERY CHAPTER
He man
Its heeman 😂 omg the fun series
Wish they will bring back that iconic He-man background score too....
I have the power was the worst part.
He-Man better be the main character, because if not I’m gonna have a problem….
Yep, they tricked us. The show is not about He-man anymore, even though he is the lead.
Why does Heman Have an H on his chest? Its supposed to be the Iron Cross
Now worth watching
Grayskull Khottaiyin sakthiyae!!!! Yennul Irukum Sakthiyae!!! He-Man! .(dot)
Everyone noticed how the shills' user names are 2 complete names? First and last? They are always in tune with: "I watched it as I child, I will watch this reboot". Netflix's call center bots are a disgrace.
0:49   So I see Vykor, That looks like He-Ro on Adam's right.....and unless I am mistaken that is a Race Swapped King Greyskull......
So it looks like He-Man won't be the show's main character?
Wait until old fans realize that He-Man is NOT the main character here!
XDDDD
What do you mean divided? It was already divided since She-ra had her sword.
They sure butched up Teela with the half-shavedhead....  I hope she doesn't come out as gay or anything like that...
I miss Tiger
IM SO EXCITED
1:31 Sasuga Ainz-sama :3
The fact that this has 33,000 thumbs up is a testimony to how far our culture has fallen. Masters of the universe is about he-man not teela it’s not a female lead powerful whamen show it’s not about lxbian relationships it’s about Adam and he man. Every single thing this sick woke culture touches gets destroyed.
Should keep the original soundtrack Heman transformation to b nostalgic
Teela and roboto look stupid
Flashgitz bit was playing in my head the whole time
Show looks good but not a fan of Teelas design. She looks more buff than He-Man. Just seems wrong to have so much muscle on her.
That’s cool. To bad it’ll be a bait and switch again. It’s the teela show. Hopefully I’m wrong. Hopefully I’m so wrong.
the annoying part is  Netflix gives you 8 episodes and a major cliffhanger then you'd have to wait another year for season 2
Unmm...
teela?? noooo
I can imagine ... "and remember kids, the orange man is bad"
So many memories, I remember getting my snake mountain when it first came out for Christmas.
what was wrong with his Iron Cross logo?  now he works for Hordak?  Lame.  I'm surprised he's still white - sooooo racissss
Once Teela takes over I'm checking out. Lmao.
Can't wait for them to do my boy He-Man shady af.
Teela lookin' like a dude in some parts of the trailer 🤣  All in all I'm excited for this show and i hope its good
He Man .(series)is remembr me childhood days 👌😉😉💪
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
So it’s all about teela and completely disrespects Adam. And you all like it. Sad…
Looks so freaking good!!
Netflix reminds me those childhood days 🥰
HE MAN
Anybody else old as me remember breaking their he-man at the waist and have to fix the broken rubber band that connected it? Switching arms off to different characters? Ahhhhhh the 80s
Look like it's not  about HE-man...
Hemen
HHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAH!
“Still remember the tune” are they referring to the meme?
wait, wait, wait wait, wait... is teela getting the other half of the power sword and becoming she-man??? PASS
Holy shit this looks dope af
Teela is a trans man now?
I am not sure but I am hearing less of heman... Thinking Netflix will disappoint.
"finally... some good fking food..."
esperen la espada ya estaba dividida en 2 en poder y honor y ahora sera dividida aun mas
Old one seems better
Oh no that's he man
@1:39 "what?"
it would be awesome if thunder cats and masters of the universe had a cross over
Just hoping it doesn't get too preachy
They will make this about Teela-Man and it will suck.  Can't wait for them to make Beastman a caricature of Trump lol.
I was a huge fan of this series growing up but looks like the Hollywood agenda entered so now I exit.
Looking forward to it... as a kid i used to collect all it's related toys... form story of my own and spend hours fighting battles... lols...
No matter how long time ago it gives me goosebumps everytime 🔥🔥🔥
1:48 That's some weak ass battle cry
HE HE MAN OMG
Good lord.....I see by the comments that every old schmuck-O does not remember the cheese that was HMATMOTU from the 80s.   Also, apparently, they don't remember the attempted revival in the late 90s early aughts.   Who cares if Teela ends up being the lead character? Frankly, the franchise needs something new and different. If you don't like it, don't watch it. It's that easy.
Magic is gone from Eternia .... Orko am I a joke to you?  YES!!!
I said hey,  what's going on?
Now I need Swat Kats recovered from Hanna Barbera and get it going. I'd like to see Swat Kats come alive. NETFLIX should seriously start polls and crowdfund section for contents that are stuck between production houses. As a filmmaker I feel contents should never die because of copyright disputes and money getting involved in it while people of large mass, long for it. 😭 NETFLIX please hear me out.
Finally He-Man is come.
Looks rad... can't wait..
More garbage  what is next  the remaster thunder cats or silver hawks  Netflix need to stop making garbage leave the original  anime  alone
ho lee crap
He-Man still rockin the Tom Petty hairdo
Please tamil dupped 🙏🙏
Its really weird when reboots come out most people say “please dont suck please dont suck please dont suck” and this trailer just kinda keeps proving those people right
I'm still a bit sceptical, All of those He-Man clips could have been from 1 or 2 episodes....😐 Please Be good, the animation and designs look Amazing 👍
Gayflix : Teela Show .
She-Ra: Still know the tune? He-man: And I say hey hey heeeeey hey hey, I say hey, what's going on
feels a lot more serious than the show I grew up with... I guess that's a good thing? Not sure yet.
He-Man?
And also a same villain 😂❤️
❤️❤️❤️ wow
"Still remember the tune"...give me chills...😭😭
Seriously copy of He man 😂
I'm still concerned that this is "The Teela show" and not He-Man.  Hopefully it isn't.  Please don't do what Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywaker to He-Man. Please....
teelO will save eternia and become the them-person
Hell no, i'm not watching the teela show, big pass and this show is gonna be a total let down, star wars all over again, subvert expectations BS.
Hope Netflix will bring Captain planet back.
This show better not have He-man take a backseat for Teela and go woke He-man was my childhood in the 80s!
if this isnt gay like she-ra im not interested
Is that Lena Heady doing the narration?
I'm gonna be honest, I became a He-Man fan back in 2002 when I was 10 with the 200X. When I heard this was happening, I was beyond stoked. When I saw the teaser, I was hyped. After watching this... I'm watching for Mark Hamill's Skeletor. That's it.   I mean the side shave... really? Plus the perpetual resting bitch face? They did such an amazing job with the OG designs that they should've stayed with that or tweak it a little bit. But of course... pants and a side shave.    Good thing Mark Hamill is in this. I wouldn't have a problem if Kevin Smith from the get-go just said it's Teela's show and we're not calling it He-Man but Masters of the Universe instead. But no. Everything I read in reliable entertainment news websites called it the He-Man show and he did nothing dissuade that.   The art looks phenomenal and I'm sure the music will be amazing, but I worry for the story from what I've already seen so far.
The last trailer was so hype, now I’m concerned, I’ll hold off until the review come out
Why does Teela have to go butch to save the world ? Is there some law that forbids beautiful women from saving it ?
Hell yeah 😈 He-Man is back 🔥
Im sure final scene will be Teela making out with Evil-lyn... because she is the main character in this series 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
This looks terrible. Reminds me of how Dragonlance was broken.
bait and switch 100% guaranteed
I think this looks promising. But I really think the voice actor of Adam/He-Man is off for his character. Almost like he doesn’t sound like him at all. The animation and soundtrack seem good and Skeletor stole the show because Mark Hamill is amazing.
I am trying to have faith in Kevin Smith but this trailer is making it hard.  Teela was my favorite character from the 1980s He-Man cartoon but the show was ‘He-Man and the Masters of the Universe’ not ‘Teela and the Masters of the Universe’. Ugh, Netflix did a good job with Voltron so maybe this will be good, but this trailer is giving me some serious doubts.
In 1:45 is He man with a dress?
Netflix doing a fantastic job 👍
This better have He Man as the protagonist....
Seems more She-man than He-man. Bummer.
So, now Teela is a strong white man... at least she's not another ginger going through black-washing.
Dam another beloved cartoon that woke Will destroy.
Notice how it's no longer "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"? He's going to be replaced by Teela. She's the captain now, it's so clear.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Se tirarem o protagonismo de HeMan para lacraem com a Teela, como fizeram com a Miss Marvel...😠😠
Millennials….and people born  after 1998+ are so easy to control with ridiculous, revised propaganda (like this bastardized version of “He-Man”).  As long as Millennials and Gen Z have their video games and new technology…..they challenge nothing.  Sad.😒
@1:38 epic smile
Still not as good as the Movie.
Why not in 3d animation or live action He-Man movie
From this trailer, He-Man is clearly not the MC anymore.
I quickly seen my man Trap Jaw.
NO MATTER WHAT U DO U CAN'T OUTRUN JAPANESE ANIME INDUSTRY..
This trailer confirms that Teela will be the woke master of the universe. They just never stop trying to push their failed agenda down our throats.
The animation looks like of castlevania
Where is the legendary bgm ?
Can You Make Tamil Dubbed
So Adam/He-Man takes a back seat to Teela in his own show.  Yeah no thanks, this should be called Teela saves the universe.  Its so obvious this show is about the wahmen and not He-Man.
Please don't make this some "woke" bs!!!
Sometinhg smell very fishie to me. I dont like what We saw.
So now we have 2 magical swords and 2 main heroes he-Man and that women but Why
No Netflix, it's He-man and The masters of the universe NOT Karen defeats the patriarchy... Thx for FU** ING 🆙 another GenX production... 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤬
The  memories of our childhood starring he- man and elumbumanithan(skull man).....often play with my dad in morning assuming  myself as he-man😁😁💗💗💗💗❤❤❤
He man ... I was thinking than ...
Powerhouse animation is just next level man!!
It better sounds like HE MAN
It is my favourite cartoon. Please dubbed to Tamil🥺.
In glad it's not made by the she ra crowd. But I hope it has a good story for all the effort that's gone into the visuals.
Omni man: look what they have to do just to mimic a fraction of our power....
Interesting that they are integrating the 'split' Sword of Power from the original comics/toys.  And the puny Adam from the 2003 version.  Other than that, I am more dubious then I was originally.
When the Season 2 Trailer drops, we're all gonna step outside, take a deep breath and get real high and scream at the top of our lungs, AH WHATS GOIN-ON-AH
He-man without He-man
The ol bait and switch   the show is about teela but not our teela, they changed her character and her look and made her into a manly buch man at maams teelor. Google sideshow teel figure.  Thats our teela.
Only attraction of heman series will be skeletor and his evil puns
That “For Eternia” battle cry at the end was weak.
Estás tan trolazo como el día que te fuiste.jpg
I was so excited about this and from what I see this girl I don't know is going to be the main character and Adam looks like they may be giving him the old rainbow flag.... Maybe I'm wrong but seeing teela(i think that's who they are focusing on since they can't do a white male) leading the charge at the end then talking to adam makes me feel. Cringe
So transformers got it right, they made new transformers movies they brought back the original Optimus Prime voice. They really need to sample the original He-Man voice if the guy that did it is dead. The original voice was just too amazing, you hear all these other voices and their just too weak compared to the original. Or hell, just sample the original voice for the transformation at least, that may be enough.
Meh.. Hope that "He Man" is there in the theme song or I'm not hyped.
so theres going to be a part 2?
Ugh.
Looking really really really bad, the bait and switch is real.
Woow😀
HE-MAN vs KAPALI
Who else remember this character HE-MAN
So is the Teela's show and He-Man is a secondary character? Pass.
I just wanna watch it before I give my thoughts on it.
He-Man.......... 🔥
Shedei HE-Man
Teela is ugly now
Ill stick to 200X, thank you for nothing
Plot twist for the revelation. He-Man will be killed off for a waman to take his place.
He man is like nostalgia!❤️
He-man😈
Plz netflix dubbe anime in hindi 😢
Okay this looks sweet
Waiting
I'm waiting meme from this
Mark hamil as Skeletor is so fitting
Another lesbian series, nice.
so.... the first trailer looked great and had me hype. This one has me worried..............
Hate to break it to you Kevin Smith, there is no Masters of the Universe without Heman, another Hollywood "Woke" hack that is ruining awesome 80s cartoons
So Teela is the focus ? The trailer clearly shows that . Why ? Who wanted this . People wanted a He-Man show not whatever this looks to be shaping into . Just ugh ! Way to drop the ball AGAIN Netflix . Fck Kevin Smith
Is that upgraded brook
Ok rumors are true HeSheManWe
Dont like the animation in here. why are there so many shadows in the characters? Its just not the original He-Man series we grew up with. Animation should be like animation. It need not be like real-life characterisation.
The "revelation" is that it's going to be the Teela show. What a shock, Kevin Smith the Hollywood shill lied about the plot.
He man : I'm the power of universe .
Woah... actual chills
Reminded me of my childhood, my very first superhero !!!
Netflix series, yeah right 😒
I never thought that He-man will come back but I wonder if there be a He-man and She-ra crossover?
all this drama, for what?
Best think they done is maintaining the 2D graphics
So wonder if Kevin smith is going to apologize to those youtubers that said this is exactly what was going to happen when he attacked them and said it wouldn't.
Seria legal se esse desenho do He-man trouxesse de volta os conselhos do He man no final do desenho,porque lindo o desenho já está.
Soooo this is not actually a he-man show?
Its about time! Now where are the thundercats at??? Yall takin too long
We want to release the Masters of universe in tamil version ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who needs this when we have Ghostbusters.
Hm... more spoilers.... Cool....😑 At least we now know he-man didn't die and will get his powers back... do I need to watch the show now that I see the whole story from this trailer?😅
If he doesn't sing the song, we will riot =)))
Releasing date ?
I’m getting “lesbian….we need to remake the 1980’s into our agenda” vibes.  I’m getting, “SHE” takes over vibes.  Nahh…no thanks .  I’ll stick to the ORIGINAL cartoon.✌🏾✌🏾
She-Male.
And of course, Adam look more feminine than Teela.
Meh. I thought they were going to try to keep this like the original cartoon? Why is it soooo hard? Cringer sounds nothing like he did. Adam once again is a teenager. Adam is the same age as He-Man. Why do they have to change it every time?
The Teela show looks so cool.  I bet she is going to really chew out Skeletor's manager !
Hell Yeah 🔥
ரேஸ்கல் கோட்டையின் சக்தியே🔥
He-Man❤️
Graphics was good. But sword of heman was very weak in comparison to previous other series.
Pls develop the martin mystery show as movie
Who's the sad post-punk rocker that's not Teela or She-Ra?  Also idk if this show is woke enough for me to enjoy without knowing what races Skeletor and Skunkor are.
I don't know, everything seems a bit off. Music, premise, atmosphere.  They broke the "Sword of Power" 🧐. So story is big fight early, Sword broke, Teela becomes Dora the Explorer and Adam and the rest are her servants?
That "for eternia" was one of the weakest battle cries I've ever heard be uttered
this show looks really great.....except for teela design what the hell were they thinking???? she looks great at first then becomes the ugly chick from the dead space cartoon.
Tamil dubbing please
If He-Man won't sing, I won't watch it
Tela: "Still remember the tune?"  Me: 🎶HE-MAN dooo do do do do do do dooooo HE-MAN!🎶
For sm reason i hate it already... Better not be as bad as it looks tho
JULY 23RD CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH. I HAVE BEEN A HE-MAN FAN ACTION FIGURES & ALL SINCE 9 YEARS OLD. I'M IN MY MID 40'S NOW...... BROOKLYN IS WATCHING
I'm still waiting for Live action adaptation of He-Man. It was way long back when first live adaption came.
Tamil lah release pannunga
He Man gone sailor moon mode 1:57
Looks cool and for nostalgia’s stake, I’ll give it a go
Proof you can't really emulate 1980's greatness here. Shame because for a while it almost looked like they did.
Heman is back..... I have the power💪⚡⚡⚡
Finally
The trailers are fire. Netflix better not do the netflix thing when the series comes out
Looks promising and well written
We Want Tamil Language 🤗❤️
why prince adam looks like a teenager?
1:55 Damn that transformation though 🔥🔥🔥
90kids here
People crying about Teela being the one who drives the plot and has dialogues🤷.  Me just looking at all the characters and naming them 😂 and getting super excited, and they even have the transformation scene.  Sometimes people should just chill and stop pretending the world revolves around them.
Plz dubbed in hindi
Need tamil dubbed
Teela looks a bit masculine imo, hope this show don't bend the knee to the woke mob
Finally! A proper magical girl sequence for Adam!!
sad, it's the Teela show alright. and what's with the ugly shaven head shit, it's that "they/them" crap again. time to sail the high seas to watch this. it's not worth paying for.
Hmph. Well now.....I'd still have Netflix but I cancelled it cuz of their last episode. Oh well. At least I Have the Snyder Cut.   Hells ya
Can’t wait until all the uninformed fans see the show is about a butch-looking Teela and not He-man. All hail woke television, here to run another series, lying all the way through.
Why do i get the feeling this is less of He Man and more of Teela?...also still waiting for this animated franchise to get a live big screen movie version going..which seems like it will never happen..sigh!
Mark Hamil as skeletor? Hell yeah
I miss my teens.
Meh. The 2002 series looked better.
make he-man series after 20 years + remove he-man in the first episode and make another power fantasy for the lonely 30 something american woman with an arts degree and a job that wont let them change the world like they were promised in college = stonks
I’m sick of these woke fcks fcking up every fcking thing we know and love. Fck Teela and Fck this show.
Judging from the trailer, if they make this into some sort of bitch show for lesbian audiences, I'm not watchin it. Mattel should know who pays for these toys, its the grown up dudes from the 80s and 90s.
Why doe the trailer focus more on Teela than He-Man? I mean this is his show isn't it?
The old bait and switch! Just like they did with The Last of Us 2. He-Man is dead and Teela is the "bEsTeSt eVaR" warrior hero!  Clowfish TV was right all along!
They got the title wrong, should be......Teela and the Masters of the Universe.
I like how for Teela to be a badass, she has to basically look like a dude, and be call the new MAN at arms. You had one job Kevin Smith and you  screwed it up.
yo where's she ra at?
This is looking to be a straight up bait and switch. They know fans have already caught on.
"So this new show is called He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Revelations right? Like the old one."  "No, it's Masters of the Universe Revelations" "But isn't He-Man the main character."
Ooh I stan twink Adam and CHAD He-man
Now do transformers. I'll wait.
I Have The Power!!!!!!!💪🔥
There goes Netflix ruining another childhood memory.
Mokka commentary viewers
who guys need tamil master of universe..vote
Looks stupid.
I can see teela in a more prominent role if the sorceress dies; she is her daughter and would be the one who inherits Greyskulls magic.
"She-Woman and the masters of universe"
More woke, virtue signalling garbage.
Please bring back Silver Hawks. Thanks
So stunning and Brave!
Too bad all the leaks show this won't be a He-Man show at all. He'll get "erased" after a fight with Skeletor in the first episode and the rest of the series follows Teela's girl gang. Classic bait-n-switch. There's a reason He-Man isn't in the show's title.
Imagine being grown men upset at a fictional woman in a cartoon based on toys for children. Jesus.
He man dies...
Any  90's kids here !!
I called it MONTHS ago.  Netflix will ruin everything with their "wokeness".  Another beautiful memory violated.
Teela is so buff, and Adam looks so weak, the original cartoon gave him much more respect. Could we not give Adam some muscle? Kevin Smith did Adam wrong.
Teela looks like a lesbian Hate her new look
I know nothing about He-man but this looks dope
Skeletor’s voice is a big no from me.  I understand everyone worships Hamill, but sorry he didn’t pull it off.
Heman....
I'm just going to say this property isn't even about He-Man and the show will be about Teela.
I do not remember Adam being a small hungry boy that turned into a muscular man when he transforms. He was already a mature and muscular man in he-man form and as well as regular-man form
BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL !!!!!
All’s I know is that it better be GAY!!!
Okay its already a female lead with a karen haircut gg. FREAKING netflix
He Man better get more screen time, ‘cause looking at this? It seems he’s in the same scenes
Heman
if netflix would finish the series of thundercats, i will offer my neighbors nut
Hope this is not  another "woke" propaganda for snowflake generation 🤞
🤦‍♂️this is ridiculous they even removed HE-MAN'S name from the title there are so going to make a joke
So Adam looks more feminine and Teela more masculine. Not hating just... Definitely watching but it's almost like it's trying too hard.
This studio does not miss, castlevania seis manos blood of zeus we're all good
I hope stewie griffin do a cameo appearance.
Seems more and more like the rumors about this show are true :/ Really not looking forward to this show if He-Man dies and Teela becomes a butch man lady
O no ....... The mask slips.
i remember this series, earlier it used to come on cartoon network with name of He man
It's the Teela Adventure Show! With special guest: He-man!
Just don't mess it up like She-Ra
Netflix never disappoints
If you got disappointed how Luke Skywalker was presented or lack thereof, you are in for a treat.( Not a good thing)   The  Teela show.
HEYYAYAYAYAY WHATS GOING ON
Never forget the smile of skeleton 😁
Teela looks like a man, so I'm gonna call her Tee-Man.
Something ain't sitting right with me and this trailer..
he man  fans power kanikk
so He-Man is Varian?
istg if they don't reference what's up
Looks AWESOME
MOTU as a garbage frame rate anime? That’s an easy pass…
Adam looks like a woman, Teela looks like a man, I'll stick with my DVDs.
This looks badass
Orko was never evil. Why tf is he hanging out with Evil-Lyn?
Cant wait for the memes that come from this
I don't know if it's going to be good or not but that hair uggh  hail H... i mean ETERNIA
Looks like people were right and they took He-Man out as the main character in his own cartoon. Hell his name out of the title says it all. Looking like total trash fing Hollywood is creatively bankrupt.
Wow! This refreshes my childhood memories. I used to watch it in our national tv channel way back in 2002. It was one of the very few cartoon series we had, just 30 mins to watch once in a week. Those few mins were enough to light up our childhood.
English web series Tamil dub pannunga with game of thrones and peaky blinders please
The Cake is a Lie!
By the way, for those that didn't get it, the story is: The sword breaks into two swords and the waman gets the 2nd half. Also she can fight better then Adam and he is de-powered for most of the season.
Tamil Dubbed Plz...
kochu tv free alle......he man
Me:where is Orko?? Netflix:In 1:42 Me:hmm why he looks like zombie and where is O in his outfit Is any one found orko in this trailer reply me
Most people don’t realize this after watching the trailer the first time, but HeMan isn’t animated in this.  It’s actually Kevin Sorbo. It just blends in so well…
Mallus will remember their old nostalgic heman !!
Looks like it's still an 80's cartoon...  Looks terrible.
You guys lie.  Its all about teela
Feminazi's here we go!! 😅😅
Oh my goodness this trailer is HYPE!!
he-man looking kinda... sus...
First Castlevania, now this - I love these directors - they're basically just living their childhood dreams.
...I was doubting the rumors...but when I see Teela with short hair and shaved sides and bad mouthing magic...yikes.
6 year old me just geeked out
The people disliking clearly don't have the power
Nostalgic, Brings back some Childhood memories 😢
Seems like she ra will save he man cause he has the red eyes  but I don't see any woke in to this honestly  I hope am wrong  hope it's good, looks great why listen  to other  youtubers  don't you have a opinion to like really your  gonna Jude cause of what someone  said on the internet  its pretty  pathetic
I just realized, it's not called he-man anymore, its called the  masters of the universe.
looks great...
I feel like he-man isn't the main  character at all and this is a feminist bait and switch.... If this is the case, SKIP......
Hey Netflix bring these kind of stuff in Hindi.ur hindi shows are dumb
Looks way to clinical to be He-Man. It just looks like every other Computer Generated Anime show.
Here we go again.. sjw destroying our childhood..
80s babies STAND UP!!!!
Memories 😱😭😭
Great trailer and the sword split? Hmmm. I'm still wary Teela is gonna be the focus.
Will She-Ra be in this series?
Graskal kotaien shakthi ye!
Looks kinda woke. If so I ain't interested. Think I'll let others watch and hear the reviews first so I don't waste my time.
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
So many people complaining about He-Man maybe not being the main character. It's called "MASTERS of the Universe". The supporting cast of most shows is usually more interesting than the main protagonist anyway, for my money. He-Man was way OP and nothing ever really challenged him. Boring. Give me Teela and Duncan and *Orko*(!!) getting to kick some ass, and I'll be happy if He-Man only shows up for the last ten minutes.
It's been ages for Helium Man
Not like old one, " I have the power "
On Episode 2 Teela dyes her hair hot pink. Ugh... This show it's going to bomb.
What a shame...We just want to see He-man, holding the damned sword! Why on earth is it so difficult? Netflix, the tide will turn when you realize that no-one watches this *stuff* and I just wish that there is noone there to save you when that happens! We need something to aspire to..you just want us to aspire to be something less of a man in our lives.. A "yes man", a "subdued man"..
All I can hear is Cersei
Not trying to start anything but the main guy really looks like Spartacus from Fate series
Is this A sequel to the 2002 show? Looms like Adam transforms into He-Man again and that's lame.
This is he man like never before. Seriously sick!!!! Respect. Me digging this! And I'm an 80s kid... haha
Siempre arruinando todo... Teela era super empoderada y femenina, no necesitaban hacerla como un camionero lleno de esteroides... Es Heman o el show de Teela y sus amigas feminazis??... Un asco toda la basura progre q hace Netflix, pero igual van a seguir vendiendo muñecos y ganando guita... Progres de mierda, arruinan todo!
Still enjoyed the original canon where Skeletor was forever imprisoned in space  thousands of years into the future in New Adventures. To bad they never finished the next series where Man at Arms was to become the villain. (The original canon series has a sequel called New Adventures of He-man.. which was basically He-man in space.)
Is it skar?
I Have The Power!
Ual!
Meh... I'll have to see what the story is like. It looks great, but even the most beautiful woman in the world can still be ugly on the inside!
ha! just like a woman!
Masters of the Universe  or  Masters of the Clickbait
Grayskull kootaiyin shakthiyae⚡💥🔥🔥
Okay, they went back to the sword split which was originally used in the mini-comics continuity, and it was also a crucial plot point to He-Man's spiritual predecessor Blackstar.
Same old story of saving the world 🤣 Cringeyyy
Please let this be woke.  As long as it is woke I'm in.  Already has a blond haired white guy, so you have to be careful not to have too much of that.  Maybe make He-Man a secondary character.
if you liked the last jedi, ghostbusters 2016, terminator dark fate, charlies angels 2019, youre gonna LOVE motu revelation!!!
this better get gay
I fu**** hate feminism...........  The show is called HE-MAN..... Why do these idiots resort to destroy beloved franchises just to promote "wokeness". People need to grow a pair and stop this SJW bs. Screw these damn snowflakes.....
We have seen this cartoon series in our childhood.  Called as He-Man.  One of the favorites of 19s kids ❤️
Internet Nerds: All new cartoons suck, why don't they make more of the old stuff?  Also Internet Nerds: Tsk, why do they keep making all these reboots, where's the ORIGINAL material?  Internet Nerds: These reboots are all just the same old stuff all the time, ugh, why don't they do something new  Also Internet Nerds: OMG THEY CHANGED IT??  BLASPHEMY!!!!  Internet Nerds: man why can't I get a date why aren't there any women who share my interests and hobbies? ;c  Also Internet Nerds: UGH SJW WOKE FEMINAZIS WHY DOES TEELA HAVE AN UNDERCUT AND A CHARACTER ARC  The lesson here is internet nerds are unpleasable and all creators should do whatever they want without any regard for them whatsoever  And, for the record?  I was a kid when the original series was airing, I had all the toys, you name it.  AND I watched everything, the original MOTU, New Adventures of He-Man, the live-action movie, the 2002 reboot, whatever I could find.  And to this old school fanboy, this looks fantastic.  It's incorporating characters, settings, and concepts that have been around since the 80s that have never made it into MOTU media before.  There are enough Easter Eggs in the trailer to tell you how much love and care was put into paying homage to the source.  But no let's ignore all that because in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-One we dare to give a woman any spotlight  Y'all don't deserve good things
Can’t wait to see how they Netflix it up and ruin my childhood
In established, canon lore, Trolla has magic before Eternia. If Trolla did not have magic before Eternia, then where did Orko and the power sword come from? You can say that Eternia needs magic to remain a living planet, and indeed the MOTU universe might fall apart without the power seed that grants magic to Eternia, and which Eternia protects, but let's not screw with the lore too much and forget about Trolla.
Why is everyone shaving half of their hair off?
He as long as the focus is on Teela and her maybe girlfriend and Prince Adam/He Man I'd pushed to the side. This makes a perfect show for Netflix or Amazon slash CW.
This was my childhood tv  cartoon, I love to watch this ❤️❤️
Too much Teela, not enough He-man
can I like this twice?
Finally he-man😍😍😍😍😍
The Power of He-Man..🗡️
So i wake up in the morning.........
"Masters of the Universe" Not "He-man"  I wonder why?...
My expectations are kind of tempered by this trailer compared to the first trailer.
Netflix, you get one episode. If I sense fuckery, I will cancel my subscription so fast it’ll make your woke ass heads spin. Also will cancel if anyone other than Prince Adam hold aloft the magic sword and says ‘’ By the power of Greyskull”
Skipped the trailer just to find out if he said the line at the end  "I have the power!"
Better they just re run the old 90's he man...that was the magic..
Please do not be a bait and switch. We want He-man!
He-Man is at it again!
I am a little scared about He-Man' s role,  according Wiki the main role belong to Teela :( "A radical return to Eternia, Revelation is a direct sequel series to the classic era of Masters of the Universe. Featuring fan favorites He-Man, Orko, Cringer, and Man-At-Arms, the story pits our heroic warriors, and guardians of Castle Grayskull against Skeletor, Evil-Lyn, Beast-Man and the vile legions of Snake Mountain. But after a ferocious final battle forever fractures Eternia, it's up to Teela to solve the mystery of the missing Sword of Power in a race against time to prevent the end of the Universe! Her journey will uncover the secrets of Grayskull at last. This is the epic He-Man and the Masters of the Universe saga fans have waited 25 years to see!"
so castlevania but he man
I HAVE THE POOOOOWER!
just as ClownfishTV reported, this show will be woke trash centered around Teela instead of He-Man.
Better not end up as some boring female empowerment show where he man dies within the first two episodes
Even if You spend billions on this but you  can't get the original emotions of He-Man (echo)
Oh childhood here I come
I am eternally glad that even today "Fabulous Secret Powers" or more colloquially known as "HEYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA" is a meme that's still going strong.
Cant wait
I thought this show was supposed to be about He-Man.
I have the power 💥💥💥 HE MAN
I've never seen the original or any of the lore in other media. However, I have heard the way Kevin Smith has spoken so joyously about this release with Marc Bernardin on Fatman Beyond. Maybe it's the cold room I'm currently in, but I got chills while watching this trailer.
Man might as well call it teela, looks like another bait and switch on the morons who think they can trust hollywood with a beloved property. Hollywood will never understand, its the awesome male heroes from the 80s everyone wants to see. Not teela, not ciri, not sylvi/loki, not a female terminator, NOT scarlet witch, NOT black widow. THIS IS A SCAM plain and simple.  We want our main heroes back, you do that, you have the fandom back. If not, whatever, your business, but I dont have to watch it now do i?
Not like original
Do they already have a date to announce the cancelation?
Poggu
Looks pretty dope. As for He-Man possibly not being the main character but Teela, this is fine with me. I am actually more interested in her. Hater's gonna hate.
Plz release this series in tamil dubbing
0:48 OMG IS THAT VIKOR AKA ORIGINAL CONCEPT ART HE-MAN!! Also I see Hero in the left and i believe King Greyskull on the right. BUT HOLY CRAP MY HEAD IS SMIAKING FROM ALL THIS PROCESS!!!😃😃😃
Don't make it pandering and saw and you got a hit imo
Sucks that the focus seems to he on Teela and skeletor just sounds like Joker and not even close to Skeletor
Another stupid woke snowflake show weakly disguised as something to honor the old 80's classic🙄. Alien overlords, come down and save mankind from these weak ass snake in the grass snowflakes👽
He-man my favourite childhood cartoon....
Good thing Kevin Smith said this was definitely NOT a Telia story😂
I'll check it out. But it doesn't look like it'll be that good.
I like this show very  much,heman is back
Seriously?
I just relived my 80s childhood in 30 seconds . Now what about GI Joe, Thundercats and Saturday Morning cartoons 😜
"The sword of power.....divided" So it's now divided into the Power sword and the Star sword. 😆
It doesn't come more generic than this man! lol It's like vomit!
Is this a DC movie ?
Their idea of a strong woman is a masculine one. A woman can be strong and feminine (like the Teela we grew up watching).
I hope theyd bring back more animations from the 80s like this...Thundercats, Saber Riders etc. Im so sick of the crap we have nowadays like spongebob rick and morty oversaturated kiddy sunshine and rainbow kiddy cartoon shit
If western animation can be this good shouldn't they try to make more comic book stories into animation? I only see DC making these animated movies but no other comic book publisher is delving into it why? Animation lately has become quite mainstream and popular. I think these western comic publishers are missing out on a huge opportunity waiting for Hollywood to make live action adaptations of their characters. Look at INVINCIBLE for instance, how successful the S1 is.  Hollywood cannot make movies on each and every superhero. So it's always better to give many superheroes animation. Spawn animated serie on HBO is another example how great animation medium can be.
Grezkal kottayude ശക്തി💪 Heman
Aaa OMG HeMan is back. I love that villain also laughing skeleton😂
Is this a movie or a series?
If He-Man isn’t the main character, I’ll pass.
Why do i have the feeling He-man is going to a side character and get little spotlight. Second trailer makes it look like a side character compared to the first trailer
Did I miss something? Where's the lbgqt stuff everyone's talking about? Or is it because there's a girl main character? Idk I'm no he-man fan so I don't know how offensive girls are in this universe
Why they change the laugh why not keep same old one
Revelation is about to be open. The ⭕️ lord of destruction? I give you a clue ⭕️⚡️44.
그래서 제가 익히아는 히맨 브금은 어디있나요!!!
Why in the ever loveing hell does teela look like she is on steroids?
This series promises a decent plot and finally some structure for the characters to fight for a cause, yet people are whining and whining and whining. Gosh. All these naysayers before even watching the series. Are you that insecure to have the main female character of the MOTU take over some screentime for a short while, before Adam finds the way to get back to becoming He-Man? Sheesh!  I’ve mentioned this before, so I’ll do it here again. This storyline was introduced back in 2019. If you were truly a MOTU fan who was eagerly lapping up the news of any MOTU progress, you’d have known about this plot already.
Give he man a lightsabre and he have the power and force from within
Did they make an evil He-Man?
This looks great. I dig it.
im looking forward to this show but why do all the netflix animated shows skimping out on higher frame rates. this is close to slideshow speed
So they uhhhh drink magic?
Is magic a stand-in for petroleum? It seems like everything could've been solved if they'd bothered to develop a non-magic based energy alternative. They appear to be sufficiently technologically advanced.
HE-MAN One of the Best series of the Planet Vaa Thalaiva 👍 vaa ...
Really love He-Man a lot during the 80's. Even save my school money just to buy those damn cool action figures. Expecting the live action version soon. By the way, I love you Skeletor😍😍😍
Looks like fun. I enjoyed the original as a child and that soft reboot they did a few years ago.
Surely they aren't going to sideline He-Man to focus the show on a buff chick with a sidecut, right?? I mean, that would mean that Kevin Smith LIED to us on Twitter!! And he would never straight-up LIE to his fans, right??
This is gonna be beautiful....TRASH!
*HEMAN* 💪🏾
Kevin Smith used to have talent, but he lost it after Clerks 2. Too bad.
Netflix really knows their how to make reboots.gonna love this
Stinkor! I'm in!
Adult swim literally ruined my childhood, He man was one of them!
What took so long Netfilx! Better be a good series else I will sell my shares! He-Man's is my childhood first cartoon I watched.
HUUUUU-HUUUUUUU 🐒 HA-HA-HA-HA 🐒 HAAAA 🐒 HAAAA (LET'S GOOOOOOO!!)
Hope they're not dividing the sword to give half for Teela. Why can't she get her own sword instead? X-23 didn't need half Wolverine's adamantium to be badass.  Better yet, if they want to focus on a badass female, just make a She-Ra show (that would be great, actually; hope it's coming next). Don't make a He-Man show and push him to a side character. It looks like a show can only be feminist if it damages a male character. (Hope I'm wrong about it all and the focus of this one is He-Man, of course. Just judging by the trailer.)  And what's up with treating haircuts as statements? People cut their hair all the time, its meaning is superficial, get over it.
Indians remember "He-Man"
0:54 John Blackstar would like to have a word with you.
Teela showings superior to men.
July 23rd can't come any faster.
Yeah can’t wait to watch it again, HE MAN
Please don't be whack
Meh.   Imma watch it.  But He-Man has got some pretty old-school themes that they are going to have to throw out to make it relevant.   The amount of surgery needed to make it current may also render unrecognizable.   My curiosity for how they've attempted it is more like an interest in a science project than it is excitement for an old story being retold.
Oh look another sjw movie where men are weak
Teela = 1/2 Man + All SJW
I HOPE She ra and He ra will see each other soon
Hopefully this doesn't get turned into Shera part 2.
With all the advances in technology and art, and they're still using that 80's style. I love He-Man, but make it more than better looking. Bring it into the future. Even Phineas and Ferb looked more fluid than this.
Oh for the love of God please give the ThunderCats the same kind of love
My  childhood without HeMan was incomplete
Teela and the Masters of the Universe 😑
Why'd Teela get a lousy hair cut?
If this gets WOKE I’m out! And my childhood intact don’t ruin it wokeflix  😈
Wow the animation is on point ....it has restrained the original lewks... Nostalgia
Lindo
its he man ❤️❤️
next boring Hipster-Shit no one asked for! THX NETFLIX
Favorite since childhood
Man despite some dudes trippin about Teelas new , I have to say this look totally kick a$$$ !!!
Mistresses of the universe: empowerment, was a better title
Yeah at last
I'm thinking this is gonna be more of a He-Man and Teela show. I really hope it a good story.
Skelator appears. "Hey kids its Mark Hammil!"
I’m here for He-Man, not Teela. If this series shoves He-Man to the back burner in favor of Teela I will not be watching this. Just gives me another reason to unsubscribe.
I think I speak for all of us is that we all came here just to see He-Man
🎶He has the power to pick up a flower…🎶
I'm out.  Kevin Smith might be allowed to ruin my childhood heroes but I don't have to watch.
Prince adam looks like a girl and teela like a guy.....i think someone got their character design switched. and damn, the animation certainly droped quality, 1:13 yaikess
😍
Material nuevo para el Bananero Sapee..!!
Yep, this is awesome. Thank you netflix!
so the sword is finally divided......well for a moment there O thought they were only showing he-man posessed,  he man being lectured and heman scared.....I am seeing a trend here.
Let me guess she shares half his power with the woman 👩 and she is better than he is.
Why do I get this weird feeling that this will be woke trash?
This Animatir i don't like  we like animation 👍
Ten minutes of He-man, the series.
Seems promising. Please Netflix, do something right for once!
It's going to be hewoke of us part 3
Yas
He man!!
The sword splitting reminds me of the Blackstar cartoon and the associated swords.
Who is the main  character 🤔? Why Netflix?
You are about 20+ and you still say  "I HAVE THE POWER" along with he-man That's how we love he-man
This should be renamed as -- Eternia ,nothing He-Man about it
wow the voice acting outside of mark hamill is terrible
I gotta watch the series again....damn
One trailer is enough to make some men cry and make the comment section burn. Lol
Hahaha the rumors were true it's all about Teela lol
I feel that I am gonna have the same disappointment of every other new series or reboot...  I dont know man, something simple done right is too much to ask these days.
Oh god this looks awful!
HE MAN
Almost every scene with He-Man is from the beginning of the show, which is going to be about the split of the power sword, so NO He-Man, until they put it back together in the end...if at all (Blackstar could show them a thing or two 😏). Since Adam can't fight, guess who is the protagonist.... The show was "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe". Now it's just Masters of the Universe with no He-Man......
I'm 21 and I still say 'I have the power' loud with He-man.
I wonder why Adi Shankar bragged about getting the rights of Devil May Cry "himself" in IGN... and no one's talking about it, it's been more than a year and no sign of "Devil may cry joining Castlevania" in what they are calling "Bootleg Multiverse" (especially considering Castlevania is finished and we'll only get maybe a spinoff now)
Why isn't there a single She-ra comment here? with how popular that series is, I thought it was BOUND to happen.
After how kevin smith lied and seeing how teela looks i'll pass on watching this
I NEED ACTION FIGURES NOW!!!! STINKOR IS HERE!!!!
ClownFishTV was right. This is a bait & switch. It isn't about He-Man. It's about Teela.
Tamil dubbing koduinga.
Cmon Netfix.....0:24 Treela looks amazing here......but then you give her this later on 1:04? and why this trailer feels more like Teela and the Masters of the Universe than He-Man?.....I still hype but I dont know, don't make the rumors true, I just want a Kick ass He-Man show, I love She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, but what worked in that show....not gonna fly well here so not do something stupid please.
Fabolous secret power
Has teela ever been laid? If not it's no wonder her emotions seem up and down in the previews of this show. She's in the bud of heat!!
I'm starting to feel like Netflix to do a good DND movie with this kind of animation
What the hell is this shit. Kevin Smith lied. This isn't the He-man show. It's the She-man show staring Teela
The Revelation is that this New series will depower He-Man and ...... another character will step in for the rest of the series............. great job Netflix
She-man and the Masters of Neo-Feminist propaganda, where every woman has to look like a transexual bodybuilder with a b**ch-ass attitude and boss the men around.
Legends return
Hmmm looks like a Teela series
kino
Thunder Cats need to re-return
why is teela the main character? this trailer made me much less interested than i was before
We want tamil dub
o the ee
The graphics and art are ABSOLUTELY FU**ING STUNNING. Now I just pray the story is good and its not drenched with wokeness. It makes me nervous what I see. Some stuff have potential for a great show, some stuff has potential for a big disappointment for the true real He-Man fans. The fans want He-Man to be the main hero, supported by all the great characters of the MOTU world...and I am not sure that will be the case. I loved Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, James Bond, Terminator...all down the drains and in most cases I am no real fan anymore. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is my ULTIMATE all time favorite show and toyline...it is my number 1. I pray, please don't mess that one up!  Two character impressions: Adam looks like a triple snowflake to me...he was always "intentionally" the softy, but this Adam-guy looks kinda...nervermind... Teela looks like she has to fullfill a political agenda. I hope we all realize it is a show to entertain and not to cover some propaganda material. We get bored and annoyed by politics enough in reality, let a sci-fi-fantasy world be free of it and unlock the joy of entertainment and dreams...I guess wishful thinking in 2021... :-(
Where's Orko?
Been on the fence about this one but I think I'll be watching this series.
Well, we can at least still rewatch the originals.  We (the fandom) don't have to consider this modern take "canon" if we don't agree with what they are putting out.  I want to like it so much, but the trailers I see present a story I can't follow.  They don't know the characters well enough and are just cranking out another series just so Mattel can sell more toys.  They lost my interest the moment the light-hearted nature of the original Filmation series was stripped away.
This is going to be so woke I can just feel it.
So king greyskull is a so-called black man now, ok -_-...
He Man 🔥🔥🔥
Really needs a scabbard….
I hope they won't ruin He man 🤫
im over 42 and this trailers give me the shivers 😅
Something tells me this trailer won't get the 6+ million views of the first teaser trailer...not even close? Me...I still have high hopes.  Fingers crossed.  Must be nice to have the dislike counts hidden?
In the name of He-man Netflix is using its own propaganda
Instead of He-man and the Masters of the Universe we get Teela and her amazing lesbian haircut?   Cool.
Booooohhh the last jedi, last of us 2 all over again boooohhh
*_I Have The Power!!!!_*
Me conocian como adam, principe de gayskull, hasta que un buen dia me me meti la espada en el orto!!!
they better not under-use he-man. The lack of him makes me worry.
😭😭😭bque desastre va ser dios miooooooo
I am so hyped for this it's been forever since I have seen a He-Man cartoon series. This is how  the She-ra series should have looked like.
wanted to watch he-man thought this show was gonna bring he-man back but they we're just using him to get views👍👍 almost got me but it's a big no on my watch list now
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
will be the story of this series more mature than the cartoon?
memories , the 80s are back baby
My word, there are so many people who can predict the future in this comment section!! Why aren't you all ludicrously rich?  Who would have thought that the human race was capable of beings who can see the future?! What an amazing world we live in!!
Ah, yes! Netflix's adaptation of Fabulous Secret Powers
This looks so good!
That's a very inconvenient and most uncomfortable way to put your sword at the back
Remember the movie 'Heavy Metal?' It'd be cool to have rated R animated movies. Realistic looking.... No offense, but not the way the average Asian animation looks.... that stuff is too cartoony
Come on it should have been the 4 non blondes.
We already have a spinoff & this feel like a spinoff too 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
WTF?!?! THE CAT TALKS??!! I only saw the Cartoon Network show from the early 2000's. That's kinda trippy!
Will not be watching this till the whole season comes out. If they drop the whole season at once then I will wait 3 months to watch it.
I was so excited about this until seeing this trailer. It looks amazing, but I don't want a story about Teela. I wanted the nostalgia factor of He-Man.
►(Te-ela Masters of the Universe)◄ lo que se traduse a que no es serie de ►(Anti -He-Man Masters of the Universe)◄ ya que el protagonista no es ►(He-Man)◄ si no es ►("Te-ela!)◄ el quien se enfoca el Progreso y Avanse de ESTA continuacion de Netflix, y ya savemos todos ya que Netflix lo a dicho a todo el mundo que ellos hacen cosas de la correcion politica y si tiene Netflix lo veran que lo ponene en casi todo sus series mensajes de correcion politica y LGTB ejemplo "sabrina la bruja adolecente" lo tiene esos mensajes en sus capitulos y asi pasa con casi todas sus series te quieren labar el cerebro con esas ideologias y las evidencias lo estan en la cara y el que lo busque lo encuentra por que hay estan las evidencias que hacen eso Netflix
Tamil Dubbed Netflix
Teela? Nice butch haircut. Is she gonna use a strap-on to fight Skeletor? A two-way dildo against Evil-lyn? GTFOH. Way to ruin a classic. Woke fucks.
The "i have the power!" Was weak! Compared to the original! And just for that this will not survive long! He had attitude, charms and charisma! Here he just looks like another barbarian character not worthy of the name!
sarcasm ... so glad they are using the shittyest animation possible . wont last a wweekk
I was initially excited until I realised He-Man is not the main character. His name is not even in the title. He is what made the show possible and they will side line him to push their girl power agenda. They should have just had him die a hero and preserve his dignity in our memory. I am black and I grew up with certain white characters they are what made that property famous. For me I don't want them changed or diminished. Just made new characters or new series and leave the original heroes alone. For example I want more black heroes but that does not mean for e.g.. I want Aquaman to turn black did he tan, did he swim too close to an underwater volcano, did he get sun burned or was he grilled. Just make new characters and leave the originals out of it.
Let’s go!!!! He-Man Returns
This is actually dope, gives me goosebumps like when I first watch the 2002 one.
What is Zodac part in this?
Is this the same studio that did Blood of Zeus?
Calling it now: 1st episode: He-Man, Teela, Man At Arms and the rest of the crew got into a sad fallout after some big battle which makes them to break their fellowship.  2nd and almost the rest of the episodes: A few years have passed, they will center around Teela cutting her hair like "the new and improved empowered wahman", which means she and He-Man weren't made to be a couple anyways, like it was supposed to be in the og series and now she's become an independent and "colourful" non-gender person (hence the haircut), because her compass points now towards another direction and all that was amazing about her, is relegated to a whiny character that "hates magic" and by extension, all what Prince Adam/He-Man represents. Until they become friends in the battle at the end of the season! The end. Prove me wrong!!!
now they just need to finish thunder cats
Finally he man
Don't expect this to be about He-Man, PC will not allow this.
I'm happy to finally see Stinkor!
Where is the hey hey meme
what
Muy bien NETFLIX.. ahora te falta   La de los Thundercats..
Amazing!!
TunderCats - …Netflix
Liked the 1st trailer with the Bonnie Tyler background music.
Enter "She-Whamen and Karens of Woke Universe".
Why cant this be as gay as the orginal 80s series?
Looks stupid
I grow up watching He-man
Why's the He-Man show not about He-Man?  You guys had She-Ra, let us have our thing.
I like how they are splitting the swords like in the original toy line, and I am loving how much Skeletor it seems we will be getting
complete nostalgia for 90s kids
Teela's new look won't be selling any toys.
Bag of shxt ill stick with the original
I wish we got a She-Ra in this too. For the fans that wanted much more than the squee-friendly show Netflix put out (glad you liked it if you did)
Netflix needs to bring back Thundercats if they're hosting He-Man.
Here we go...half-shave Teela and evil He-man.  Did Kathleen Kennedy produce this dung nugget for Kevin Smith?
Dope glad to see my childhood cartoon making a come back
GAAYE
This trailer will be remembered my childhood time. Now understand this show end I'm waiting for show.....
Oh, boy. Nuff said.
How does he not stab himself in the back? 🤔
🥵
I HAVE THE POWWWWEEEERRRRR!!!!
The teaser is more powerful than this to be honest
I thought for a second (after seeing the first trailer) that it could actually be a good, manly show like 40y ago, but nope, rumors were true. It's going to be another shit show were the main character is sidelined because he is a white male. He must be punished for his crime! Good job, netflix!
Why does He-Man look like a guest star in his own movie?
Please dubbed in TAMIL
Is he  HE-Man or Hercules?
I have the power..  Legendary quote
That Skeletor cackle better be on point!
Not feeling the voices or the sword. I'm a big fan of the 2002 series. Should have brought those voice actors back.
I’m all in!
That's not Tia That's a man man......ok you have to admit she does look kinda Manish 👀
I have to appreciate the couple frames of skeletor laughing
1:56 we missed to hear this dialogue many years from this series.
Wow great. Childhood memories recap ❤️❤️❤️
The trailer is awesome. I'll give it a chance. If it is a convincing story with interesting characters and fun to watch I don't care if He-Man is not necessarily the main character. The trailer is definitely promising.
Somehow He-Man & the masters of the Universe gets me pumped.  I felt nothing for this one, for the entire trailer.
😍😍
Who wants He-man as a sidekick?I do not. That was not the show I remember. I hope this not the case. 🧐
Looks great, but I hate anime “badassery” where every single character breaks the laws of physics and can take down 20 people at a time. It’s the equivalent of “wire-fu” movies.   He Mans grounded animations were its best quality.
Why are people in the comments mentioning teela I don't know much about he-man to be exact
Why can't the hero ever have a pot belly and man titties?
Oooo, expanded lore--love it!  Now we have an idea what was so special about Eternia and that castle...
Looks like He-man loses his power and has to become a sidekick to Ileena, Teela whoever, I bet that he’s not even the main character.
Why is this so good?!
Snarf snarf
I'll never understand why so many people want to shit on this show and are unwilling to give it a chance. I grew up watching heman and had probably every action figure, and I could give an ulcerous cancerous f@ck if they made cringer the main character as long as the show is story driven instead of toy driven for once. All of you people crying before you've even seen it are why we can't have nice things.
I get the times are changing but why can't a male protagonist just be a main character any more why is there always a need for a female counterpart that always  outshines them in the end. Am I worse because I'm a man because alot of these predictable ass writers keep trying to push that. Star wars, Loki, Batwoman, the MCU moving forward. Alot of Western entertainment appeals to one social group  and just tries to encourage divide or even instigate that divide by just spewing political garbage this is why I watch alot of foreign media from talented creative minds in countries like India Korea and Japan. I know I'm getting ahead of myself saying this but if you don't actually feel this way after watching that trailer and seeing the comments then watch it again another franchise to absolutely obliterate. Women are not the issue the agenda is. If there is any platform where a man was seen as a hero and it was successful these writer will flex the full extent of their creativity by gender swapping the mc and providing that replacement character with no other traits than their gender or for odd reasons focusing heavily on their sexuality when it adds absolutely nothing to the story. 2021 sucks
i was hyped for this series, now i get the feeling they are doing an L4D2 on me again, so i´ll wait for the reviews of some trustworthy  sources.....
So just not about  he-man
apparently the show will not focus on He-Man. He's just used in the trailers to generate hype.
I KNEW THEY WERE LYING
I really like the feel of this series. It mixes the old with the new so well. I think those who watched in the 80s and those who, like me, watched the 2002 series will like this.
I bet He-Man since he's a cis white man will join Skeletor's side. From the trailer Teela seems like a bad$%# acting like she is something, lol. At least there's a team and not depending on her to be He-Man cos she's whamin and already powerful just cos.   "I built a life of truth" "Away from magic" "Now you want me to save magic"  Pure cringe and cliche bs! LULULLULULULULULULU Kevin Smith I use to love how you went against Hollywood, wtf happened to you man?!
Born in 1980. I'm fnckin psyched for this. Had every damn toy.
“Eternia will rot and die”….. Maybe call it Temporaria instead 🤷🏻‍♂️
he man better have an equal amount of screen time, and moments to shine.  other wise, clone fish was right.
And i have the power
He-Man?
Quando sairá naruto shippuden dublado....é a pergunta do dia....solta uma pista aí Netflix....
Bring out the new one piece show already
80s kid approved
Well, I'll take the hate. I for one am looking forward to this. If the story works and is good I'll be happy.
So... Its a show about Teela and He-Man appears on it  Im get it right
Yes, that's Mark Hamill as the voice of Skeletor. Does he sound a bit like The Joker? Sure, but it's Mark Hamill!
Looks like He-Man has been wokafied and pacified. /Pass
I'm looking forward to it
Todos tienen la misma cara. Teela parece una travesti. Espero que la historia al menos esté a la altura.
Stinkor!
Such  nostalgia memories from the 90’s !🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
"Magic is gone from Eternia"  Cue talking green cat
es ivan el trolazo
This looks pretty badass
Michael Jackson: Hee Hee-Man
Sad. Just sad. Watched the cartoon when I was lad...This is not He Man..The characters from almost 40 years ago dont play-well in 2021.
I hope we all get an updated version of He-man singing.
The power of Woh man
Expecting a bald-faced bait-and-switxh into wokeness.
Looks good.
OK... Didn't see that one coming
He-Man get a transformation in Sailor Moon style?
FOR THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL!!!
The whole thing is a bait and switch.  Kevin Smith said Teela is the lead.  The official synopsis describes her as the main protagonist.  "Revelation refers to Teela's journey."  -Kevin Smith.  So don't be shocked when He-Man gets relegated to a supporting character at best and Teela is essentially Rey Skywalker. Stronger, smarter, more capable than He-Man and everyone else around her.  She will be without flaw.
We all know its not gonna be about he man so why bother
This trailer does make it looks like a beat and switch. It does not mean the story will be bad or will trample over the original series. This is a wait and see situation.
This trailer summed up pop culture today. “Magic gave birth to Hollywood. The first planet in all of cinema creation. But now the magic is gone, good stories and relatable characters will rot and die. And as goes Hollywood, so does the entire pop culture meta”.    They reach out to retired actors, and old franchises, “We built a life of creativity, away from Hollywood. And now you want me to sell you my IP’s and bastardize our characters?”.  “Yes. To save Hollywood”.  He-man representing the fandom. “Whatever became of Hollywood, the poor deconstruction of our characters, and our tv shows, we will face it, together”. “But the sword of the fandom was destroyed”. “Not destroyed, divided”. “Whether you serve the fandom, or the woke, we all need to band together now. To create an actual good show, or Hollywood dies”.    Unfortunately, judging by this trailer, this show won’t be it. Sigh. I really got my hopes up on the first trailer. That’s my fault for believing in magic again.
AND I SAID
Somebody wake me when they get around to Thunder Cats and Silverhawks...then I'll give a poo
Please don’t be woke
Something tells me it won't be about He Man in the end.  Dissapointing.
Ahhh yes, Skeletor.....the *REAL* mvp!!!
Yeah thts a hard wait until i know that Teela is not playing the main role. This is HE-MAN and not Teela. Also I remember Teela having a crush on He-Man so why is the now a lesbian? I thought it is a sequel
nice
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
Dolph lundgren is the master of the universe
HEMAN!!!
Netflix needs to pick up Silverhawks and Thundercats
Thunder cat hooooooo
Does Mark Hamill just have one evil voice that he uses for everything?
This trailer showed ALOT of Teela and barely any He-Man... In a show ABOUT He-Man... Knowing Netflix and todays climate im gonna bet Teela is the main character because "representation" or something -_-
I dont if my friend was trolling me but he said that he heard a rumor He-Man is gonna come out as gay on this🤣
The 'Revelation' part of the show's title probably refers to Man-At-Arms changing his identity for the woke audience into:  Transwoman-at-Arms.
This looks ridiculously good.  I’m sad it’s not a continuation of the She-Ra reboot, but I’m sure I’ll love this too.
And still gives me that creeping feeling that He-Man is going to make the heroic sacrifice of stepping down to give Teela the spotlight.
Mark hamill forever
I've only watched He-Man memes, but this looks dope.
O  que  será que irão revelar?
Garbabe. Total garbage.
I hear Cersie Lannister in the begging.
Show hasn’t even come out yet and people bashing it crying why Teela so important, in the comics something like this happens and she has to get the power sword back to Adam. What’s the big deal they have hinted at her importance early on in the og show.
He-Woke. Hard pass. Damn I was hyped for this...   Why Teela looks masculinized? Yikes 👎
Oh no...it's looking like the rumors were true...
PREDICTION: He-Man will be present in the first and the last episode. Otherwise, it'll be the 'Teela Show'.
I gotta warn you, they’re going to go for nitty and gritty in this series.
Plot twist he-man is not part of the show!
tbh, i don't really watch his normal animated show, but i do watch his gay porn version comic growing up. So it's kind of weird to see him fighting normal monster.......
This... does put a smile on my face...
Everyone here asking if He-Man is the center character: The is a reason why this show dropped "HE-MAN" from the title. Remember, it was "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe".
Just don't make He-Man a bitch and we're good
Is Teela abandoning her role as Captain when she found out the Truth?
He man and Karen
Marky mark hamill back at it again!
Nope!!! I still wanna watch this, but the feminist agenda is too strong.
Looks like another iconic franchise dies, thanks a lot Netflix’s 😨😰😓😔
I hope this doesn't die early like the 2002 He man cartoon series. I am so amped up for this new series I can't wait...
No thanks  I would rather watch classic He-Man on dvd
We got Orco up in this bitch!!
She-woman? ... seems the rumors were right.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Guess they had to release that to save Kevin Smith's ass.
If you really wanted to update this into “woke 21” it would be he rah and she man 😂
Dunno why, but I thought that this was going to be a spin-off of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.
I hear Wonder Woman, Cersei and Joker its going to be chaotic
Woke garbage 🗑
Animation looks gorgeous. Hope they don't make He-man suck, and Teela the hero. That would be stupid. It is like making a Superman movie, making him suck, and Louis Lane saving him.
I have the sinking feeling this will be about Teela/He-Man joining forces with Skeletor because good & evil are abstract concepts that don't matter in the face of fascist conservatives who want to take away our magical diversity. Or something like that. Really hope I'm wrong.
SKELETOR CAVANI AND THE MASTERS OF THE EUROPEVERSE
This comment section literally sounds like the word "reddit"
1:56 Gracekal kotai in sakthiyeee!!!!!!
Why dose sherra have a karen hair cut.
Now do a BraveStar remake, Netflix
The fact that it's called "Masters of the Universe" kinda confirms that it's not about He-Man. That shouldn't come as a "revelation" to anyone. RIP He-Man.
So they are confirming the Teela show.  No thanks.
Yep this looks like the good ol bait and switch that was rumored. 👎🏾
Damn everybody was right He-man bad TeelaLGBTQ good
I said "HEEY HEEY HEEY HEY, HEEY HEEY HEEY, WHAT'S GOING OOOON!!"
Kevin Smith =💩💩💩💩💩
Bro its like Shera for the honor of gray skull
That looks so cool. I wonder if it is the same animation team from the dc animated films.
another bait and switch show, ill pass kevin soy-smith can go back to posting pic's of himself crying
Using he-man name to tell a teela story... because obviously woman need man to be something, great job Netflix.
El bananero se va a poner cómo loquita
The SJW haircut.........cringe.....ugh.  Looks like Blubbering Bob's poo'd the bed again.
Teela and the She-Dudes of Eternia....Thanks Kevin Smith, you Hollywood shill
i cringed watching this
Yup , every single doubt came thru,  this is so not about he man , he is the bait , trust its the whole women empowerment,  woke bs , ....we were on the verge of greatness  , we were this close
So Clownfish was right. Kevin Smith lied. This is a Teela centric retelling of He Man. Teela will be the hero who saves Adam and the day in her SJW haicut. Animation looks great.....too bad the storytelling will destroy it. Pass.
Shame Kevin Smith lied. Here comes toxic masculinity He-Man the villain.
I’ve never been a big fan of He-Man before, but I’m pretty excited to watch this.
My favourite childhood show
Wow, what the crap is this. This looks good, don't get me wrong, but this is definitely not a continuation of he-man and the masters of the universe. They went iron man 3 on us....... Prince Adam is a main side character to teela ????? No wonder they dropped the he-man name from the title...
Wow this looks like a switch-a-roo. You know you can show a female being bad ass too without the buzz cut right? That's just stereotyping.
The crazy thing is the original show was an ad for damn action figures
Teela is 2 much in picture. Get bad vibes. Teela and the masters of universe. I hope this is not a disappointment  like the movie Jem And The Holograms...
"Behold, the lord of destruction." Mark Hamill Ladies and Gentlemen.
"Teela and The Masters of The Universe"
they made it for the gays omg we won
That has potential. Just don’t wokify the shit out of it and it’ll probably be good.
this feels like a switcharoo.
I was fairly excited for this up until watching this trailer. Hard pass.
Looks so great this teela and the masters of the universe
Woke Netflix would prefer to rename it: Ze/They/He/Cis Man and the Masters of the Universe.
I honestly liked this more than that flashy, musical teaser. At least now we can understand what's happening for real.  I still have the issues about the suspicion this show won't focus on He-man. Still, his scenes here looks good, specially the ones were he's clearly working along with Teela. At least by now, it's promising.  The fact they showed Stinkor and even brought the "divided sword" gimmick shows they may have done their homework. I like this.  Let's see how this will unfold.
If this is going to be another feminist cartoon I'll pass... we need it to be testosterone filled.
I hope this show doesn't end up as Masters of the Woke Universe
I can't wait for this.
Duncan is still hot. OK 😍
una cagada he man no es el protagonista
This trailer spoils the entire first half. Adam loses the power to turn into He-man. This turns into the Teela show for entire first half. Adam gets the power back and He-Man returns at the very end, lol wtf
Is this supposed to the thunder cats??
Please make this gritty and not child friendly..
Anybody know the music?
This show was literally impossible to screw up... but I think somehow Netflix found a way
Ryu hanbin
Holy s**t. This might not suck. O_O
"The Teela Show"... (There, I fixed the title)..Kevin Smith is a lying piece of woke garbage
Mark Hamil for the WIN!!!!
This looks amazing...but something is off. Like, very off.
No Teela, I don't want you to do anything. You're a side character. Plz Netflix dont Flux this up.
shit woke metoo gargabe fck u, Wokeflix
Masters of the universe was never just about He-man, hence why the show doesn't have his name in the title. I grew up on MOTU and She-Ra and am really not sure why people are so butt hurt about change. There are lots of people in the queer community that grew up on this show and would appreciate seeing themselves in a character they used to love. I get the argument that changing an established character gay is off-putting but even if Te-la is gay in this show she wouldn't be the first woman in history to have had a romantic relationship with a man that later realized she didn't have sexual feeling for that person.
Let's be honest. Teela's design sucks. The goal was obviously to remove all traces of femininity.
sweet cant wait for more skelletor memes
How brave of you to have He-man guest star in his own series. They totally called it. Any more of my childhood you want to ruin?
That bulky Teela design it's pointing that this show will be  "She-Man" instead.
Why do they give every female protagonist THAT haircut nowadays?
Oh Kevin Smith you've outdone yourself
Well this is disappointing…  Get woke, go broke.
i just canceled my netflix 😃🤷‍♂️
So three lesbians join up w/ oppressed bad guys to save Eternia? Hard pass
Ofcourse its about shitty Teela like so many youtubers leaked.
Mark Hamill dose it again
I truly hope this doesn't suck
I love the zombies, they look great.
Trailer looks like He Man is playing 2nd in his own show
Way to ruin an iconic character Netflix, this is a dumpster fire
Ummmm a esperar el diseñó de teela no me convenció a esperar a ver este nuevo máster of the univers
Words on the street Said it is not about He-man, i guess they are true
"Oh shit new He-man trailer dropped" *sees classic character with stereotypical wahman empowerment one side of the head shaved haircut* This gon be terrible
so basically all the leaks were right. good to know...
What's going on?
He better be singing that one meme song
get woke go broke netflix u know the drill
So this is what they resorted to trying to trick us with the trailer to only find out that chick with the Feminist haircut is the main character
I understand that they are trying to appeal to nostalgia, but from the comments, it is clear that again a cartoon will bring new superficial controversies to our daily lives.
When the first trailer hit I was a bit excited, but now... Maybe it's just me but the voices all seem a little...tame? I know the original was "over the top" but it worked. I would rather hear a scream that cracks and distorts because of raw emotion than a clear cut opera note that is calculated. I don't know. I'll still watch it, but with less expectations.
My theory: Magic is failing and the sword is magic so it splits and Skeletor gets a half. Faker hurts the Sorceress, who loses her power and becomes the old lady in white you see with Evil-Lyn.  He-Man loses his power and becomes Adam in front of everyone (the revelation). Then Teela is given the mission to unite the sword and preserve magic. In her crew you see Adam tagging along. Maybe the Sorceress tells Teela she's her mother and of her destiny of becoming the next Sorceress (another revelation).
I need to go back and watch the CN version that came out when we were kids..
plz dont be woke plz dont be woke plz dont be woke plz dont be woke plz dont be woke
Ruined my childhood
Oof, you wanna do that "For Eternia!" take again?
It looks better that I espected, He-man is like the 80's cartoon, a good heart man that always gives advices.
a lot of super butthurt manchildren here upset that the fluff from their favorite toy line isn’t playing out exactly like their childhood fantasies lol
This will be better than whatever trash we got from She-Ra
Strong female protagonist teaches evil He-man to respect wahmen!
Teela: "Still now the tune?" Prince Adam: "Some things you never forget.... heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa!"
Kevin Smith really did lie to all of us
the lich 1:36
Looks like a DC animation
This is a Teela show
You know, the classic He-man always make me wonder how Adam and He-man have the same physique but people can't tell that He-man is Adam.  But this one, we can see the clear difference in physique. Adam is a lot thinner while He-man look way huge than him.
Cringe Anime = Netflix 😑😑
Bro what happened to his gains? 😧
I can't believe I cried watching this.  I used to come home from school to watch on tv the original.  I'm 52 now and love this even more with fond memories of the past.  Great to see inclusive gay characters.  I love Netflix's!
You had me at Stinkor, Netflix.
Now if Kevin will just get Thundercat up and going.......
Im really curious who's idea it was to give Teela that stupid haircut and lame generic outfit?. She would had looked good if they just gave her Skrillex hair and left it long BUT whoever's idea that was pretty much jinxed this entire show.
He she Zi Za Zu They Them Zad Zid Man
Bait and switch. Kevin Smith already confirmed it
the more i see, the more i want!
He man  is not the main character and that sucks..
Better have Drielle on it.
Are you going to have cancel/woke culture $hit ideologies in this one, netflix?
IM SO EXCITED
it's a piece of garbage
Buy the power of Netflix I have the power to ruin your childhood
Por primera vez veo que Netflix no hace una desgracia y más con esta grandiosa serie, esperemos que revivan a los thunercats o a los SilverHawk
That new Teela show doesn't look half bad :)
Oh yeah
Ah. So the rumors were true. Its a bait and switch.
😍😍😍😍 Amazing. Thanks netflix
I have a little more faith in this show now.  But dammit, I hate Teela's redesign.
Looks like a set up for an old fashioned switch-a-roo.
All I can do is remember all the Robot Chicken skits of He Man when I watch this. 😅
So the rumor were true. It's the she-woman show now
Loving how they're trying to be all serious with characters who are literally 80's action figures.
That epic laugh 1:39 🔥,makes him super comic villain of all time
Safe to say it’s gonna be disappointing
All i want to see is Hordak Prime and Skeletor Eternal. Is that too much to ask for ?
You're on thin ice, Kevin Smith. Very thin ice. But I do hope you make it.
Amazing!
Teeela And The Masters Of the WokeVerse
Splitting the swords just like the original mini comics!!! Kevin Smith probably drenched this sucker in little references like that.
Please tell me it's not gonna be based on that flowing hard he bitch
Looks good. I'm in.
Netflix, I hope you don't let me down this time, these are heroic characters from my childhood! Plz...
I wouldn't mind seeing an adult version of this. Just sayin.
Looks like the snake men will be in this!
Why they gotta do Teela dirty with that new look?
This looks woke
Teela looks like she had been taking steroids. Lol Plus Sarah Michelle Geller doesn’t seem the right voice for her.
Incels in the comments.  Gonna be dope!
I smell feminism
Make Eternia Great Again
Omg. At this point? This disappointment is long gone, and now? We can just laugh at what’s coming, what we all knew was coming, as douchebag Kevin smith pulled the rug out from under us: a matching lgbt Ne-Man series to go along with the She-Ra reboot, only it looks like they didn’t make any of the characters obese. Now I know why there isn’t a Teela figure to go along with this line. Aside from Teela being lesbian, there’s just one more thing that I didn’t think would happen? Prince Adam looking and sounding super feminine. I will,watch the show from beginning to end as I did She-Arafat, but only with a 🙄 or 🥴 facial expression, as this will be more of a parody than anything to ever be taken seriously. To the She-Ra reboot fans: Congratulations as you’re all jumping for joy. Only, the true fans, at this point could care less anymore lol
Noooo donde te sentaste he man
Jesus,  they are taking it so seriously.
it is So back!! ❤️
1:10 I predict at least one episode of an evil He-Man.
Why are people so picky about this show? He-man's been the main protagonist for the show for years. Im ok with Teela to have the spotlight, she is a good character and she has a cool backstory.
Woke-Man & the LGBTQ of the universe💪
The black chick is giving off Amber vibes from Invincible
I almost teared up! Wow!!!
This deal's getting worse all the time.
Of all the people to do skeletors voice, why Mark Hamill? Hes not a skeletor, hes a joker. The guy that did skeletor in the 2002 reboot did an amazing job as skeletor, and that 2002 reboot was amazing as well. The only thing in my opinion that they drastically overhauled in that reboot was the sword of power and it looked ridiculously awesome! All of the other characters looked original but updated and more bad-ass, the animation was tight, and castle Greyskull looked better too. This looks like a downgrade to me, especial Skeletors voice.
A man saying "I have the power" ow my freaking ears lol
Iban el trollazo
HE/HIM MAN
1:38 mood got wrecked when Skeletor didn't go mngehehehehehe
It looks good, it also looks like they are using He-Man to get people too watch the Teela show. It would have been nice if they showed Teela so people can decide for themselves.
Aint no way teela is fighting he-man 1v1 netflix dosent know power scaling
HE-WAMANNNNnnn..... more WOKE crap. I'll pass.
"I've got a bad feeling about this." -Han Solo
I cancelled woke Netflix last year.  I don't regret it.
Oh wow teela and the masters of the universe.  Looks like the creator of this never watched the original. Pass.
Little faith in Kevin Smith honestly. Couldn't they find a better writer for this? Animation looks great but looks like Telia will be the main character.
starting to think they should start making video game anime movies, like zelda and   and Metal gear solid
Sh*t y is the girl taking up most of the trailer, not a good sign, just make He man the protagonist and have the most screen time because it’s his f***ing show and we’re all good, director
More woke dumpster fires.
This looks good, like the original, now we need a proper remake of Thundercats.
hahahah this looks stupid
Pls be he-man of old untouched 🙏🙏 not defiled
Chris Wood is He-man. And I need to hear Kevin Conroy as Merman
WOKE ALARM is ringing... Kevin Smith is a fraud.
Teela the series.
All I hear is Cersei
Teela. And the Dudes of Eternia. I'll pass.
Kigwahahhahahhaha
He man in anime would be better
looks alright. but it's netflix. where's the catch? what thing are you gonna absolutely butcher that you omitted here. it is your tradition after all
Skeletor 👍👍👍👍👍
I dunno…I got a baaad feeling about this…
Why do I get the feeling He-Man isn't the main character
EVIL HE MAN?!!?!?!?!!!?
I was always a Transformers fan growing up, but this, this looks good. I'm excited!
So Mr. Hamil got his big break fighting the Dark Side but deep down he was born to play villains.
Chills
Who did thumbs down and why?
I really hope it's all about He-Man...yes the supporting characters should get some light, but it's He-Man!
Teela looks fierce i'm so ready for my Queen 🛐
This looks so awesome. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Something tells me he-man won’t be a big part of the show
Look really good in design and presentation
It's a NO from me, Dawg.  Meh.
Why does Teela look like a dude?
Looks decent
Netflix, please don't mess this up.
You would believe after years having "The Power" Adam would be able stand in front of everyone without it and know how to fight.  Yet he is standing behind the group and notice we didn't see Adam fight or have a weapon I'm worried this is going to feel more like the Side-characters story then He-Man.
Why does Teela look like a guy?
The Revelation is they're going to shelve HeMan and his "toxic masculinity " and put Teela in charge. Kevin Smith is a chump.
Did he said "i have the power?" Im preety sure is "i am the power" is just me?, or this is another mandela thing or something?
Not enough heyeyaya
There is A LOT of woke powerful whamen power hair going on here with Teela 🌈…..  Lemme guess, He-Man f’d up and is a dumb evil patriarchy and Teela and her girlfriend save the universe…… 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case
i hope it turns to be truly good.. at least in the similar level of Castlevania good which with all contradictions and issues it was seriously a badass epic series that truly understood the heart of Castlevania and it's iconic characters  well is the least HE-MAN deserves as a franchise
Teela looks like a man 😖
Kevin Smith the woke already screwed this up...something so simple...again destroyed
Netflix anime taking over the world 👍❤️😘
I’m really excited for this sh*t!
80s Skeletor: "She's fainted. Just like a woman!"  2020s Skeletor: "She's stolen the whole show. Just like a woman!"
I need a catch-up/re-cap video!  Like, "The story so far" from the classic 80s cartoon.  I mean, most (if not all) of the old episodes seem to be here on You Tube, but I don't really wanna pour that many hours of my life into it just as a refresher (even though I have watched quite a few lately).  I need like a "He-Man 101" or a "For those who came in late..." Actually, more like a "For those who grew up with (and have fond memories of) it, but have forgotten quite a bit of it."
thats a dumb hair cut.
Skeletor still hsnt made the nyahaha sound
Did I like miss a series
they should of made his iconic line have a little more emphasis and carried out a little longer just like the old vesrion
A;tLAB style animation is too distracting at this point to be able to see the story, for me   I keep expecting Aang, Korra, and Toph to turn up, with Sokka telling Cringer that, unfortunately, he's made of meat
Wtf dude. So much spoilers.
No
Why do i get the feeling this will be focised more on Teela?
Funny how it’s not about He-Man but Tella. Watch the trailer again.
That doesn't look all about He-man to me, Smith
LOUD NOISES GRRRMRGRRRR !
They really go crazy with the shadow in the animation.
Gods the quality difference between this and She-Ra is astonishing
But does he have the power? Please someone tell me
Now do thundercats
If this series gonna be about a female centric character… I swear to god ….
A She-Ra cameo or more is all I'm asking for and I'm good.
I love the animation, but I'm not  too keen on the heavily impled story line that He-Man (the driving force of the franchise) will be in one episode and then it will all be about Teelas quest. Ultimately when you watch a MOTU show, you want your main character to feature in it, not the back up characters.
I bought the Keldor & Origins Kronis Rise of Evil 2 pack at the exact same time this trailer dropped.
Great, another girl full of attitude....yay....not really
Needs more Orko
Please don't take it to left field with this series Netflix,  just let us enjoy this upgraded ride back into time to our favorite childhood cartoon! PLEASE?!?!?
This looks like it’s gonna RULE!!
She Ra series was great.  This?...nah.
This looks more like a Tela series then He man….oh boy 🤦🏽‍♂️
hola muy bueno video
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 Woke garbage
Scare Glow!
I want more Orko
Why is the frame rate on these cartoons like 5 FPS?
Judging by this trailer, I'd say the rumors about this being the Teela show have some truth to 'em.
I said HEYEAAA HEYEAA
Where is she-ra?!?!
Teela with a very masculine face, the gay half shave, and a diverse tan Prince Adam / He-man in the back seat... probably gay too Yeah, after the gay She-ha, what a surprise
So is there going to be a Prince Adam's Red Hot Dance Mix cameo? Four Non Blondes version please!
Lo que más me gusta es skelector
I didn’t even really watch He-Man but if they make her the new He man at some point in their story I will drop this show hard. Seems like something they’d do. 🤷‍♂️
So is this a reboot or contouring the story of the original?
HEEEEEEEYY YEEEEAAAAHHH EEEHHEEHHH I SAY HEY !  WHATS GOING ON ?
The lack of he-man makes me worry
I would gladly watch this and anything if Netflix would not cater to pedophiles with Cuties still on it.
This trailer pretty much confirms the rumours that Teela will be the main character.
Total woke crap..Like a wet fart in a paper bag
they really took that one villain from scooby doo and made him the lord of destruction 😂😂 all i can see is that meme of him running away and laughing (iykyk)
Betcha He-Mans gonna be a gay fellow. No getting around that with all them glittery rainbow magic. Not saying that's bad, I guess. Just an easy bet with Hollywood's weird obsession with having character's sexual preferences be a selling point.
"After a calamitous battle fractures Eternia, Teela and an unlikely alliance must prevent the end of the Universe in this sequel to the ’80s classic."  I sweat to good gravy Netflix, if this series doesn't centre around He-Man. We be pissed.
Mortal Kombat Legend style. Smart
Looks great, but could we get another one with Dolph Lundgren as well?
2021 plot twist: HE-MAN is actually G......... Finish the sentence
This looks sick, I'm slightly too young for he man but this looks really good, I'm looking forward to deep diving the whole universe lol
First the deal with Teela and now the splitting of the sword between her and He-Man. This better not turn out to be more of the woke shit or imma be pissed.
He-man sounds beta 😂
Looks awesome! So when can we expect the next GI Joe, visionaries, and M.A.S.K cartoons?
Having seen this trailer I'm now really worried. Kevin Smith may have done us over after all.
Greskal kotaien sakthiyea .....ennul irrukum sakthiyea
Oh wow. I remember those days when I was little, he-man, she ra conan saber rider etc. such nostalgia ❤️
was that Lena Headey's voice???
Why did they change He Mans symbol?
Heman dies and the two swords will be wielded by two women.
So this is where the animation for Adam Vs Zeus Went
Sura puli yenga da.......
Oh great, Cringer talks again…and he sounds like a shonen protagonist. 🤦‍♀️
I predict the Sorceress will die who is Teela mother, The sword of power perhaps at her death or something else spilts. This makes Prince Adam revert back to his normal self and maybe without He-Man nobody can challenge Skeletor its possible he claims some of Castle Greyskull powers. This scatters the Masters of the Universe to the four corners making Skeletor the de facto ruler of Eternia. Several years pass and because of his overuse or misuse magic starts to disappear go dry, so before Eternia is destroyed the Masters of the Universe  must reunite and Teela being daughter of the sorceress must accept her destiny and become the next one only then will she have enough power to challenge Skeletor but she will need the help of Eternias greatest champion the most powerful man in the universe He-Man if they hope to defeat evil once and for all.
This trailer is 600 million times better than the previous one that had that absolute horrific god awful "need a hero"  garbage song in it.
Really hope this isn't the Teela-show. I just want a strong straight male protagonist in 2021 is that an insane request? lmao
This better be He-Man's story
Was Skeletor Mark Hamil?
now don't get me wrong: I'm glad my favourite hunk is getting some actions.   But...  if Netflix has the rights to He-Man, why don't they get Nolle Stevenson back and make a full-on reboot/remake like they did with She-Ra?
I don't see what some people are complaining about.
The sword of power got split into two!! - - - John Blackstar anyone?
I Don't Know, I prefer the clássic
So it’s now Teela an the mistresses of the universe? I pass.
Them memes are great for this trailer.
Give me He-Man and Snake Eyes and it’s over for anybody 👍🏾
How about.. For Narnia 😂😂
Is it just me or does this look very anime like I’m liking it
Looking forward to Skeletor roasting his minions. Maybe even making beast man cry lol
Wait She-ra is in this one too? It has been  more than 30 years. This is awesome.
Yeah this is gonna suck
I’m calling it now, Adam and Teela BOTH have to say,”By the power of Greyskull” and they become HE-RO, the most powerful PERSON in the Universe.
Plz don’t suck 🥺
I am going to give this a chance but they better come out swinging better then they did with the last one.
He-man is a white male kevin smith is very woke. sorry but my gut tells me this wont end well for he-man.
Musclor est de retour !!! OMG !!
Great !now reboot thundercats
Please don't be like Last of Us 2, please don't be like Last of Us 2...
Classic bait and switch. Show He-Man in the trailers and then give him 2 or 3 lines in each episode.
Kevin Smith U did it again 👏🙌 The GOAT
wow this really looks shit
Noice.
Not too much promising judging the official trailer. Lets hope it not suck too much.
Oh Jesus cristo lesbian teela? I mean to each their own but the character is not like that
Not a whole lot of heman shown….mighty suspicious
I hope they dont make skeletor gay
I already know people are not even gonna finish the series, i cant wait for this
Hopefully the series won't turn around she man😂😂
So rumors where true
So I guess this series is going to be more about Teela is more "manly" than He-Man huh? More SJW/feminazi agenda infected crap again?
Ah ah ah what's going on~ Cant wait~
Hmm....this trailer makes me think that Teela is main character.  He-Man is put to the side or made evil.
Why didn't they bring back the original song when he transforms!!!!!!!!
There was barley any he-man I’m starting to get scared for this show
Coñoesumadre ya cagaron a He-Man también maldito netflix
CHOTTO MATTE
Ahh.... He-Ma'am and the power of Gayskull.
Ah the old gotta save the world to save the universe story
this looks like it gets weeEeeiIIiirD... a much more honest trailer than the first...but we do see adam and old teela together so perhaps he man is throughout the series and not just in the first 10 mins.
That moment when Cringer Is the voice of reason.
Teela's SJW haircut looks suspicious. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.
WOWOWOW! @1:27, Teels has... ...a lightsaber?!? &, so... is He-Man possessed, or does Faker just have redeyes now? 👁👄👁⚔💀👅💀 🔴💋🔴🔪🗡🧿{目}🧿
He-Ma'am
Hmmmm… he says he has the power.., but does he tho?… Seems like a lot of focus is on that lady and not so much on He-Man…. :/
Brings back childhood memories really look forward to it 😁😁
Looks like they’re going in the original direction with the whole power sword story
Looks amazing 👏
Tee-Ma'am and the Masters of the Universe. Seriously though, why do they have to make her so butch? What's wrong with having an attractive female that is a capable fighter?
They should make a TV show of She-ra and He-man since they are siblings
"Without magic, Eternia will rot and die. And as goes Eternia, so goes the entire Universe." Muggle Earthlings: "Pffff..drama queen."
Hope Hordak makes an appearance.  And while we're here can we get a GI JOE Resolute type series as well? Thanks.
Thank you for your great animation Netflix. I Cannot wait to binge this show...over and over and over again!!
I’m strong! I’m a woman!    Well guess what bitch the people who care are watching She-Ra.    It is not a crime to give us one goddamned show ABOUT a guy.
I AM THE HYPE!!!
I just can't wait to it 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Couldn't they have just called the show, He-Man?
It better not be a lgbtqrstuv show! That has to stop.. 1 percent of the population want to dictate to the 99%.  If you want acceptance it can't be forced!
Tee-la and the masters of the universe. Also a guy named He-Man but is not important.
I'm gonna give it a chance....But I know what It's gonna be.
A Quick Verse for those who are struggling in any way, “ So do not fear for I am with you do not be dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you and help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” ( Isaiah 41:10) Turn to God and Jesus now and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that he died on the cross for our sins then was resurrected three days later by God they want to be close to you, please ask for repentance and read your bible daily! Much love! 💓 (Clarification that I’m not trying to force anything upon you )
Eternia 80s playset and lizard man who was only in two episodes plus red eyed he-man i'm guessing is faker! Man they are pulling out the lesser known cast from the 80s show and toys for this show!  Wonder if any of the new adventures of he-man heroes or bad guys will show up as easter eggs?
He-man uses Sword master style to make the Sword of Power into dual wield blades, Nice
Animation 🔥🔥🔥 Voice acting 🗑️🗑️🗑️
Why is Teela a lesbian/ non binary/ womxn female bodybuilder that’s clearly been taking some sort of muscle enhancing/ testosterone supplement??
The balller move here for Netflix would be to release the entire original series and pin this at the end of it as the last season so everyone gets to say they saw the whole thing. Otherwise they will just get a bunch of people complaining that the original was much better who never even saw the original (or like me... Saw it but don't remember it at all).
1:50 "Still know the tune?" AND SO I CRY SOMETIMES WHEN I'M LYING IN BED JUST TO GET IT ALL OUT WHAT'S IN MY HEAD AND I, I AM FEELING A LITTLE PECULIAR AND SO I WAKE IN THE MORNING AND I STEP OUTSIDE AND I TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND I GET REAL HIGH AND I SCREAM FROM THE TOP OF MY LUNGS "WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND I SAY, "HEY-EY-EY-EY" HEY-EY-EY I SAID, "HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?"
At least they aren't covering up that they are making the HE-MAN vs Telia series anymore.
So, the premise is: Man-At-Arms went to get a pack o' cigarrettes...
I have a bad feeling about this
This is beginning to look like She Ra more than He-man 🤔
Looks pretty good
We need a Conan The Barbarian show like this
"Magic gave birth to..." and the lies prop up from start.... but its ok for you sh1tters
Contando as horas! 😭
Couldn't get Victor Garber for Skeletor eh?
I just threw up in my mouth a bit...  Kevin Smith is a lying sack of dookie.  Seriously?  Standard issue SJW haircut and all??  Who do you think you're fooling, Kevin?   You've been neutered or what?
on kcuntflix its probably a she man
why that lgtb haircut WHYYYY
LOL Masters of Diversity
Men felt like crying hehehehe nostalgic
Can we FINALLY get a damn He-man game other than the GBA game or the European PS2 game I mean c'mon SO MUCH POTENTIAL & SO MANY CHARACTERS.   Huge open Eternia world that has various dungeons like zelda. I wanna hop on Battle Cat, ride across the map and have a water world dungeon fighting Mer-man and his troops,  Have a cave dungeon with Beast Man and his beasts trying to stop me from reaching him. Tri-klops dungeon he would have his drones, Trap-Jaw dungeon is a metal scrap yard, Snake Mountain is of course Skeletor's dungeon. It would work just fine and I would buy that in a heartbeat.
Masters of Wokeness, here we go. It’s Netflix so I’m sure Teela will come out as non binary by episode 3.
Looks like they need a woman to save 'em. 🤢🤮
Kevin Smith owes Clownfish TV an apology. This series has none of the charm of the Filmation series.
As a man in his thirties who grew up a fan of the original, this looks amazing! Not sure why everyone is so upset about He-man not being the main focus, he was always the least interesting character in the show. As was pretty much every 80s kids media protagonist. The villains and the sidekicks were always more interesting. Glad I'm finally getting the best version of these shows, not just the toy ads that drew in young me.
Please do WarCraft also.
All I want is a "what's going on" reference and we're good, Netflix
Gimme more Shera
it looks like it's just going to be the Teela show lol
I don't watch cartoons anymore 🖓
Wow... I remember my childhood.. ,,♥️♥️♥️
Huh did He-man’s tiger always talk?
To Kevin Smith I say…🤦‍♂️
no battlecat tease....bs
here there are people of little faith
Damn this so good
If only was in Manga/Anime drawings version would be more...bad ass if you know what i mean...
They gave Cringer back his voice.
Bro why she look so muscular?
Let's go!!!!
I guess you can’t be a strong woman with long hair. you have to destroy every feminine features to appear strong to the Twitter verse
Mm.. I see why some people are concerned given recent media, but I still have a good feeling about this one. I think - hope they're just trying to rope in a broader audience, and aren't going to do He-Man dirty.
Wow now I know where the funds of she-ra went , they made a good choice
Love it, can't wait.😆
They were right. Neon is peak aesthetic.
I'm ready.
I hope this one's as gay as She-Ra was.
old but GOLD
"I AM THE BACKDROP!" Yeah, this is going to be just like TLOU2. Lmao
Watch Netflix gay up He Man like they gay up everything else they touch.  (But seriously, He Man was pretty gay to begin with).
Looked like He-Man was taking a back seat in this trailer for Teela.
wait, Cringer talks?
all the hype from the past trailer, died here, a dry feeling death, like a jungle flower in the desert . . like a drifter who nobody knew his name
It’ll get canceled like everything else
Fichi af
Fuckin' shit. Goosebumps.  I hope it lives up to it.
Oh look a lead male character in 2021 ... Wait
So they want to make a strong female character, sure, but why would they take an existing character and make them more masculine? Strong != masculine.
Wow. All the whiny crying incels are out in force here. If you don’t like it don’t watch it simple. Did I whine about Thundercats ROAR?  No. I ignored it until it went away. I’m still ignoring it.  “It isn’t things that upset us. It’s our judgements of things.” -Epictetus
According to the rumors (I hope they are just that, rumors), it will be forced inclusion, teela will be the protagonist and apart homosexual, I clarify I am not homophobic, but it does bother that they are being politically correct and it does not look natural and organic and that it looks more fake than a 300 dollar bill. I also think that the Latin dubbing will not be the same from the 80s
Teela looks freaking stupid with that feminazi haircut.
Looks to clean. Like it was made on an Ipad.
Not too bad,very curious to see Kevin Conroy as Mer-Man. Masters of the Universe:The Batman Who Talks to Fish!🤣🤣🤣
Im expecting that Skeletor would be still sassy
Mark Hamill is gonna be amazing as Skeletor..
Where are the merchandise toys? This was the original corporate cartoon.
Well at least HE -MAN is still blonde haired white and male , given the current times that we are living ,  the character could have been changed to a transexual / female  minority  nonbinary that use the pronouns they them
Sooooon
I just read some article about stinkor not being used in this and right away  stinkor AF. Plus cool to see scareglow
What a cringe fest.
Idk, looks like feminist propaganda to me.
WTF ... I remember the ladies look like ladies in the old cartoons, now they made them look like men...are they on steroids now???
Netflix present:TELA and a guy called he-man
We'll see.... not holding my breath...
This is awesome and also featuring Mark Hamill is cool too.
This better not suck with Teela being a Mary Sue...
Netflix: so how will people know teela is a strong wamxn? Kevin Smith: we gave her the standard side shaved head. Netflix: oh good. Wouldn't want our strong  independent female characters to look different.
The New Brazzers
Só vem!!!
God this gives me the 2000's remake vibes and I love it!
looks totally crap don't even like the voices
Kevin Smith...you better not let us down.
Reminder this is actually the Teela show
Oh man this is giving me Castlevania and blood of Zeus vibes
Teela... some Red haired women who's probably non-binary and dating the Black woman.....    ... Lets turn He-Man into 'woke' She-Ra.....   Can those of us who were boys in the 80's keep SOMETHING? ... from Doctor Who to Terminator......
Looks horrible, why make a week side character so important and why give her a douch haircut?
Somehow it still feels like it's going to be the Teela Show.
He-yeeeeeea 4k 1080
Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck.
Interesting speech the narrator gave. Thank god Eternia does not share the same universe as Star vs the forces of evil.
this is how transformers style should be. reboot transformers please
Kevin Smith, huh? So is every frame sold as an NFT?
This show looks great so far. To many adult crybabies predicting a show before they even see it. People need to realize this is a soft reboot and not an exact replica of what they seen as a child. This cartoon really needed an update and looks like it got it. Can't say if it's good or bad yet but excited to see what it's about.
When you release a toy called Skelegod and give it the accessory of the sword of power, you've messed the bed.  You cant say "Back After 40 Years" and then change the name of the show hopping people wont notice.  All this does is make me miss the Classic and the 2000x series.
Yeah...their gonna bench He-Man.
The only thing that would make this better was it the rest of this trailer is just a serious and cool and action-packed as it is but skeletor was the same goofball from the original series. I just don't want to take Skeletor seriously and I think that's understandable
how can anyone thumbs down this masterpiece smdh
Teela is having a wardrobe problem.
It feels like the designs are just straight up toys.....and that’s the greatest feeling ever
- Remember that show from the 80's whith He-Man, mostly everything were focused on him and his name was in title? You know "He-Man and Masters of the Universe"? - Yeah, of course! I liked it from the start and even "HEYA YAYAYAY" meme! - We returning it with Kevin Smith as director, it will be dark and edgy you will love it! We even do the first trailer with "I need a hero" and spotlighted He-Man as main charachter. -Yay! Can't wait to see it sound like somethin' good and.... - But wait,  He-Man is sidekick of Teela now and we will focus on his not He-Man life side, that was you realy want to see yeah? YEAH? - I better watch Q-Force now....
Whelp vote with your eyes folks. If you're mainly interested in this show because of childhood nostalgia, then you're probably here for he-man. Not sure why they felt the need to push teela since they already have she-ra ticking those boxes. There's a glut of ridiculously unrealistic female op characters as it is and my eyes can't stop rolling at being force fed even more of them especially on 'modernised' classic ips like he-man.
Nyaaaaah intensifies.  Will definitely be checking this show out. That subtitle tho, "Revelations" seem like REALLY overused at this point tho.
F***k YEAH!!!!!💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Bait and switch! Its all about Teela. Sorry She mam...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍🥰🤩
I guess we can take it easy on Skeletor. The main enemy of this show is Teela Tequila.
just finished season 1. well done! loved the show.
He-Man and the masters of the universe 2002 animation still looks good than this. Prince adam and tilla are emaciated in this version
So, this is not he man story? If yes. Skip
Only the real ones know they changed the title to what it was actually was before
"You remember the tune?" "some things you can never forget." "And so I wake in the morning and i step outside..."
So how long till the anti sjws are here and try to convince everyone that it will suck because Teela excists? 🤣
Really? Teela is the main character? Not even She-Ra? He-Man is just a sidekick? I knew it was too good to be true.... Classic Netflix...👎
I’m definitely watching. But, that “I have the power” just doesn’t land with as much gusto as the old one. Why can’t they seem to get that part right? He’s not just yelling a phrase. He’s literally calling out to the universe for power. GIVE THAT SHIT SOME REVERB AND SOME CHEST!
Mark Hamill as Skeletor excellent voice casting, I just can't get my head round Chris Wood voicing He-Man though, only heard him talk as Prince Adam, just doesn't sound right to me....
where is the music that we know and love??? I hope it will be there
If he man doesn’t get majority of the screen time I’m leaving by episode 3
GOD DAMN!!!
He-Man for the next generation
I didn't believe when I watched the first trailer, but now it looks like what I expected from Netflix's adaptations (or any media nowadays), a tomboy, voice of reason, unlikable female character and the male counterpart as backseat, or as they say a "strong" woman, I really hope I'm wrong, but is hard to believe that I'll be.
If it's half as good as the 2002 series I will be happy. That was an epic He-man series
I really, really want this to be great, but I got a bad feeling about it.
He will probably die and be replaced by She-Man at some point in the series
Hurry up july 23rd
Hopefully He-Man is the man character if not, what’s the point
Looks boring now compared to the first trailer... not interested in a woke Teela show
and I say... heyy yeahh yeahh yeah yeahh..  heyy yeahh yeahh i said heyyy what's going on. hahahahahahaha
He-Man, Transformers, Thunder Cats, GI JOE,  man..what happened to all the violent cartoons.
Eu não estava preparado para isso!
I have the power ahh it takes me back
I can just smell the "woke"
I want Adora, Catra, Glimmer, and Bow to show up.  Wrong Hordak can be there, too
First trailer made it look like he man was going to be the main character. This trailer makes it look like he isn’t the main character. I really hope that this is not what happened with the last of us part two where they made the trailer seem like the main character is going to be Joel but then when the game release he was brutally killed immediately. This better not be another fake out for a woke character to come in then destroy the franchise with their wokeness. It’s dishonest to your audience and an insult to fans of what was the series. You can’t just lie to your fans just to trick them into watching the series. It’s morally wrong! And will backfire when nobody is watching it a second time.
😊
Bully at school: hahaha, you are too skinny, what did your mother feed you?  Grass? Hahhaha. Me: I AM THE POWER!!!!    *nothing happened* Got beaten by bullies
Eh
so tee-la the tomboy or the homosexual character?
Looks like castlevania but I still get flashbacks from dreamworks she-ra
Yeah it's gonna be about the girl saving he-man. Because.....ya know
Netflix why u are like this
This could be good
I guessing that black chick is Teela's girlfriend? Cause straight women can never be a badass.
And slowly but surely it's moving more and More to making Teela the main character and He Man the sidekick
and whos that male looking lesbian, is suppose to be?....
I really missed he-man and the masters of the universe. Hope this will be on par.
Give me a live action movie....dam the cartoon
This will not be HeMan focused show and that’s a bummer. The sword breaks in two and then Teela and HeMan will both be the hero. That way the makers of this won’t be called names by people who wouldn’t even watch probably.
Omg i think i came a little 😳🤣 Looks amazing 👏😍
I see a distinct lack of Mekanek.
Is Cringer the sage of the heroic warriors now? Why does he have these lines? 🤦 I must seriously ask the question if Smith if hes blind and stoopid cause why should a cringy green Cat (no pun intended) ask this rhetorical sage-like question. Cringer is there to.. well.. cringe. To better mark the difference between him and battlecat. Seriously, I now have to question Smith's general intelligence and intelligence as a director
I hope skeletor is still a master of roasting people 🤣🤣
Will Orco make an appearance?? Ooohh..Man E Faces?? Bring me back..Getting my favorite bowl of cereal for this one!!
Great, He-Man isn’t even the hero in his own show anymore. It’s just Masters of the Universe now. Does anyone get the feeling that the next time they release a version of this show it’ll be Heroes of the Universe, because heaven forbid your show should sound vaguely patriarchal. 😂😂😂
Why this got so many dislikes tho
God bless everyone
what would be cool is if they eventually introduced she-ra and her gang and even tho its like a different canon to that of the new she-ra show they made it like a reference to those characters, maybe even with the same voice actors. That would probably be in a later season if anything tho i guess what im saying is unless they make adam gay i dont care until adora shows up..
That Cersei at the start?
So...what will happen when Adams reunites with Adora. Lol.
look like Thundercats when you shave them
Yet another WOKE reboot. Say no more.
It’s 2021 and I don’t trust nostalgia peddlers anymore.   Star Wars, Trek, Transformers, G.I. Joe, Robocop, even Robotech came back as a comic and it was hot garbage.
Oh noes! It looks like Teela is getting a character arc. How dare you steal He-Man's masculinity? You are literally making men everywhere into emasculated cucks with this wokeness of not simp-adoring prince Adam, and instead, wasting story time on a mere.... _female._
Se for com a porra da shirra eu cancelo o netflix. Vai tomar no cuuuuuuuuuuu
"This shit is gay, y'all" Riley freeman (2006, circa)
Finally the truth comes out! Why even hide it in the first place? Thats why its called "Masters of the Universe: Revelation" and not "He-Man And Masters of the Universe: Revelation" cause there's no He-Man in it. Shameful, absolutely shameful. Kevin Smith truly has gone in the Leftist deep end.
Looks and sounds trash
Masters of the Progreverse
So there will probably be a short-hair Teela released first, if they get to classic Teela we'll also get a hair down head? Niiiiice.
I'd she-ra in this
He man was my childhoods all time favorite, but even i as a grow up can admit that He man overall is and allways was pretty  gay with muscles and blond long hair. So i dont get the fuss about lgbt bla bla about it.
haha yeah! Thundercats Ho!
I have a bad feeling about this…Teela with a SJW haircut and the center focus of the trailer? If He man gets character assassinated or killed, im done.
heres my review not gay enough
This actually look cool af!
pass....rather watch the original. woke incoming.
ok n ow do thundercats
Why?, Why!!!!!!  .... The Teela show??. Thanks Kevin.😣😣😡😡
Missed opportunity for Skeletor to be remade into She-letor.
The teela show
all i care about is he-man and it better be good, if not we got problems.
This makes me hate Teela.
So I am 42 years old but grew up with this so have to at least check this out!
Hope He-Man here is far more better than his cringy-ass self in the 80s.
Yeah it was a Teela show... Why were we expecting something different.
Hmm, seems sus. This looks like its more about Teela than about He Man.
Voice acting in this one seems so lame.
This will be so good. God damn it.
He-man and the Jobbers of the Universe?
I'm really surprised ‼‼‼ He-Man is white in Netflix 😂😂😂❓
Now all we need a Thundercats show with the same animation.
Garbage.  The animation looks like one of those direct to video DC movies... how did it get worse 40 years later?
Hollywood is the true enemy HeMan must destroy it.
So it looks like the rumors were true. It's not about He-man... It's about Teela and her lesbian gf.... So disappointed
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Teela Show! The Masters of Woke!! Mark my words!!
So Teela is the main character....great
It's weird how Netflix is going to have a He-Man and a She-Ra show in two very different universes.
The Hemans feminazi sidekick its no good
And he prays.....omg do i pray...i pray everyday.....for a revelation 😂
I'm rooting for Skeletor. C'mon Skeletor!
Trailer’s missing Bonnie Tyler.
Woahhhh I'm alllll for this mfn story omg 🤯🤯🤯
I prefer shera
Well seems that the rumors probably are true. Many of the scenes from the trailer with He-Man are from the beginning of the show, hence that tag team scene shows Teela wearing the circlet and having on the same outfit she has before casting off the circlet and getting her updated outfit. Pretty much all the rest of the scenes with her and the new outfit show either a possessed He-Man or prince Adam. Mind you prince Adam in fight scenes which hints at he loses his powers…  I mean for all those that are warning people this new version of the show is gonna nix He-Man for Teela… well this trailer doesn’t do anything to dissuade me from believing them.
Seems pursompus to say u need magic
Yes yes and yes.
Alright Kevin, I see you!
They're trying to pretend the narrative is different after backlash.  I'm not fooled.
Out on my birthday, best present
That leaked script is looking to be true. Stop warping nostalgia to shoe-horn female leads in. You don't need to depower He-man to make Teela relevant.
They already spoil everything... 1° The hero is Heman and the idiot Teela is the main one... 2° They split the sword... Finishing it off with Heman 3° Haven't learned anything from ghost hunting and dark fate terminator? Oh really? Teela's idiot?
woke shit incoming
Do not screw this up, Netflix. If we get that rumored bait and switch, you’ll find very quickly that you in fact do not have the power. DO NOT GIVE HE-MAN a back seat.
I'm this show don't have he-man in almost all the episode I'm not watching.
If we are getting a He-Man when are we going to get a Thunder Cats remake
Feminist b@#$%$&*t destroying another cartoon !!!!
ive got a baaaaaad feeling about this
Somewhere right now Kevin Smith is crying watching this.
Mmm This ...I got a feeling that He-man is not the main protagonist.  But will see. Good trailer.
The animation looks very good and expensive, the details! Many characters look cool. However I think that Adam, He-Man and Teela look ugly. First She-Ra looked like a dude, now it's Teela's turn. He-Man looks silly with over the top muscles, Adam looks kinda feminine. Also not a fan of "whole universe might die" plot, so generic and overused.
Childhood hero reborn
Way to go Kevin Smith. You gave me chills.
Looks really good!
Everytime I Look At The Comments I Become Depressed.  I Don't Care If It's About Teela Or Not ,Just Give Us A Good Story PLEASE
The Hype, people... the Hype!
Not as gay as the original,  but still, pretty gay.
I see Teela and Adam have a lot of work to do (and we go the "Hero is taken over by evil" trope going....again.).
Man at Arms finally looking like he's living up to his name lol
All hail Kevin Smith for his participation and passion on this project. HE HAS THE POWER!!!!
Teela and the Teelas of the universe.  Because He-Man is a straight white male. So the show cant be about him.
He-man without He-man
If cringer voice don’t drop when he turn into battle cat, I donwanit
Skeletor beats He-man episode 1 takes the sword and the Wahmans save the day
0:44 He-man's sword doesnt have a sheath when he puts it on his back? Thats stupid, his back would friggin' bleed..
👌👌👌🙏🙏🙏
Please be good 😣🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
What a hell is Ruby Rose doing here??!!
Seems too woke. It will probably be trash.
Looked interesting at first but I am sure they will find a way to ruin it,thats all they seem to do these days well old beloved franchises an tv shows
looks more like Streetfighter and Fist of the North Star, and I miss the old theme...:(
I love Teela.  I'd even be willing to look at this as her show.  But I can't hear that voice without hearing Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Takes me completely out of it.  She's just not a great voice actor.  And her haircut is so stupid!  Why?  Its okay to be a bad as a woman, and still look good.  If anything, her hair is more of a hindrance than before, because it was swept up, and kept neat.
Is it me or does it look like he man is going to be a side character?
1:55 this part gave me chills the music and everything too hits different
So Skeletor is gonna get the other half of the Sword of Power.  Wasn't that the way the toys were back in the day?  You could put He-man and Skeletor's swords together?   This is cool.  I am excited.  Evil He-man sounds pretty terrifying though.  I suspect Teela as the new Sorceress is gonna need to put the sword back together.
I'm glad he's jacked and not some weird transgender mixed skinny guy with abs...
Don't let this trailer fool you this is more feminist garbage
So first of all I screamed in my car on the last 10 seconds
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....
Magistral!!🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Ugh why is it anime
Yep He-Man is a villain now
Went "hang on, I KNOW that laugh"..and wasn't wrong either.
neflix remake the dungeons and dragons cartoon.
He-Man show, but the star ain’t He-Man?
Shera better not be stronger than He-Man.
Finally
I got $50 on They’re going to scrap he-man within the first season probably the first episode, And replace it with a female character that will *Save* them.
My childhood
original animation looks better than this shite
wait was that hordak at 1:42
more brutish women with side shaven heads? smh
!Llego el bigotes!!
The amount of insecure little boys who are already concern trolling over the HE-MAN show not having enough He-Man is absolutely staggering. This is a 2:30 min trailer, you sound dumb af making definitive statements about what the show will be.
Please don't let be this a woke shit!!  🙏🙏🙏
Oh look, a bait and switch.
No San Diego Comic-Con again this year so having this is exciting.
whats next thunder cats :D
at first glance this looks likw it will be a woke version of He-man crapping on He-Man and turning teela into a goddes who preaches at everyone butcan't do anything wrong old he-man man fan and felt no nastalgia for this show only the high possibility for it to shit on the original its fansthis trailer made me totally not interested.I guess expecrted to o much from KEvin Smith and this just looks like a woke pile of craptrying to tak over something else from the fans. God why can't someon just burn down the hollywod inbred retards
Hmm, Thor would whoop He-Man's a$$, turn Teela into a woman and Man-at-arms wouldn't even be one of his sidekicks!
It's on Netflix, don't you mean xi non-denominational gender fluid sidekick, instead o He-man?  Also, isn't it typical to name a series after the title character?  From all indication it should be named  Tela...
Did you just check out the VAs on the series? A-listers who most probably had He-Man part of their childhood. Can't wait!
God, please don't SJW He-Man. Please just let us have this one thing. Please.
Jesus, ajude para que nao seja mais uma série cheia de lacração, amém
So Teela is main character?🤔
With Teela's new look I have a feeling that the revelation in the title will be her being Adam's twin brother who changed it somewhere along the way.
Amazing!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
O SKULL TA BOMBADÃO
"ETERNIA will rot and die...." seems like they chose a kind of ironic name then
My dad introduced me to He-Man and to see his reaction made me see how hype he was as a child
Just want Skeletor…
Looks like the rumors were true after all... Tila will be the main focus... Kevin you have failed us.
Looks stupid. Especially Teela’s haircut.
Cool. It’s about Teela. Got it. I’m out
Nope, I'm out. Cringer does NOT talk.
So I keep hearing this show is about Teela, not He-Man?
Why are Powerhouse Animation shows so edgy and barely showing any comedy?
Just call this show Teela: Feminism of the universe
Love the extremely insecure weirdos who can accept an evil skunk man and a cackling skull wizard but a lady with short hair and muscular arms is just Too Far.
Oh gawd. Another woke story line. Looks like the rumors are true. *sigh
The should of called the show SHE–MAN
are they seriously making He-Man second fiddle in his own damn show
Kevin Smith Presents: She-Man and the Wokest in the Universe
I guess clownfish was right!
Ta loco minha infância  nostalgia Meus filhos vão conhecer 👏👏👏👏👏👏
"I-VAN SOY UN TROLAZO" I-VAN como va a afanar el bananero.
Why is Cercei opening this trailer?? I hated S08 of GoT, I hate her now
Bait.
He-Man: a series about strong women and shoehorned minorities.
What kind of juice them niggas drinking, how them get them muscles?
This looks nice. It seems that there would be  several protagonists than one (the main cast ofc). This could be the opportunity to give the other characters a fair amount of screentime and flesh them out. After all, the show was more of teamwork based.
Incoming bait and switch hero
HEY YEAH .... do i even need to type the rest XD
"I ... have ... the poweeeeeer!!!" *proceed to do a male vertion of sailor moon transformation*
Is he still He Man or will they woke him into They Man?
Looks great, now make one for Thundercats!
He mannnnnnnnn🔥
The trailer's look good.  I really hope that I'm wrong but.....  I cannot shake the feeling that He-man is about to get the Luke Skywalker treatment.  Move over Luke, Prince Adam is thirsty for some of that green milk of shame.
Evil He-man ??? give me a break.
epic
bait, and switch
it's very pretty
I hear me some Lena Headey
Sorry, but all I hear is Buffy in some weird alliance with Cersei.
H e y  Y e a h *I N T E N S I F I E S*
Why is there 1k dislikes? Are you ppl mad?
My woke sense is tingling...
The more that gets shown, the more the rumors are proven right.
This looks amazing.
Brazil 🇧🇷
Mistress of the Universe.
Heman
See.....good things do come to those who wait!!!
I CAN'T WAAAIIIIIiiiiiiittttttt
I knew it was gonna be Teela the show
wait...
Yay Orko!!!💗
This is not about Heman at all.
I don't think He-Man will be just a supporting character in the series. From what I've seen, Teela and He-Man are in a sort of split protagonist thing, where both Teela and He-Man are the protagonists of the series. That tactic doesn't usually work out, but there are some cases where two protagonists create a good story. Even though the trailer showed many Teela scenes and few He-Man scenes. It looks like Eternia is dying and everyone, including Skeletor's forces must now fight together to determine the fate of Eternia. Even though it may be about Teela (which somewhat makes sense, since Teela's story was something interesting in the original show, where she lost her mother and Man-At-Arms became her father), I'll sure give it a watch. Hopefully He-Man will also be a protagonist of the series, with Teela.
Wait x23 the cat talks now.
Watch us get a million hate videos about how this is still going to be 100% all about Teela.
Here comes the bait n switch!
Can't wait
BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL......I HAVE THE POWERRRR !!!!
Brutal!!!!!!
0.49 Are those previous versions of He-Man and/or former champion's of Grayskull
When he shouted "I HAVE THE POWER!" I lifted my hands in triumph. No shame in my game.
soooo.... "all praise the powerfull women" in a HE-MAN title... Nice animation, but I really think the plot will be the worst.
OMG
I'm extremely anxious!
I thought after "still know the tune" they were gonna go heyeyeyeyeyey
Pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck pleasedon'tsuck
From wiki   "But after a ferocious final battle forever fractures Eternia, it's up to Teela to solve the mystery of the missing Sword of Power in a race against time to prevent the end of the Universe! Her journey will uncover the secrets of Grayskull at last."  Oh yea. This Teela's story
What happened to animation? No one seems to know how to do it anymore
So the leaks are true, this is another pathetic attempt of woke Hollywood to erase the past and "correct" the cultural "crime" of having a iconic franchise headlined by a male figure. It was strange how they took He-Man of the title, now it's makes sense it will be "Teela and the Master of The Universe". And of course it couldn't been a modern revival of a old franchise without putting the classic male hero as a failure, and the cause of all problems that has to be saved and show how it's done by the "strong female protagonist". Hard pass for me, have already seen this multiple times (Star Wars, Star Trek, Terminator, Watchmen, Ghostbusters, MIB, etc) and the results are always pathetic.  At least Netflix continues to be consistent in disappointment, butchering one franchise/brand after another. Can wait for the dumpster fire that will be the live action Gundam movie. Or the Avatar show that by the rumors/leaks seems even worse than the live action movie.
I have the feeling I’ll ship Adam/He-Man and Teela ._.
Orko, he'll be there. that cute silly wizard.
spop is lookin a little different
1:56 I am Sailor Moon, champion of justice! On behalf of the moon, I will right wrongs and triumph over evil, and that means you! - sailor moon
Becoming more and more obvious that it’s all about Teela 😕 like most, I had high hopes they wouldn’t F&@K up what was a great childhood memory. Enough with the gender and identity politics
Netflix do not fck this up
Where is He-Man?
Looks very cool!
Saw a lot of good things. Really good things. However, a couple stand out points.  -Teela has more screentime in the trailer than He-man -His sword breaks in two. I think we can all guess who the other half is going to -He-man appears evil and fights Teela  I'm optimistic, but worried. Don't put sending a message above telling an entertaining story, please
Ho boy.  Teela went and got a Captain Marvel butch cut.  I'm not liking where this is going...  Sweet animation, though.  I'll give you that.
so, Clownfish TV was right apparently, this is a Teela show, He-man is a secondary character in his own series
If He-man dies Netflix dies with it
this kinda looks like she ra take 2
Is anyone worried this version of He-man will be woke?
Trying to stay positive. But I'm getting nervous.
Crap!
Teela and the Masters of the Twitterverse
I miss my feminine-curvy female characters. First it was reboot She-Ra (yuck), now Teela is pumped up with testosterone. Some people will have no issue over this but I really need to vent.
God, please don't let it be woke!
An awful lot of Teela being shown in this trailer...
Yes yes let’s go!!
Masters of the Uniwoke
It’s called He-Man! 😂
I'm ready for woke garbage
OHHHH HELLLLLLLL YEAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He-Man the original barbarian.
Of course He-Man can't be the hero protagonist. He's a straight white male.
Nice try Netflix, nice try...
I wonder if the "revelation" has to do with the Sorceress being Teela's mother. Maybe she is killed and the truth is revealed -  having chosen to be Grayskull's guardian over being a mother. Could cause someone to be not such a huge fan of magic, especially if it's revealed that magic was used to mess with her memory. I suspect that at the end of the day, Teela will take up her mother's mantel. But first, He-man's power will have to restored....Skeletor and his generals defeated....and Eternia saved. Them showing 2 swords makes me hopeful. Perhaps the 2nd sword will choose Teela temporarily to help He-man and the other Masters win the day, then it will hang on a wall until it finds another champion (she-ra). Doubtful they'll mention her directly. THey'll probably just do a little post-credit nod at Adora.
I'm cancelling netflix if He-Man gets killed off first episode.
Laughing at all the males cry-babies hurt than He-man has to share 😂 In the original show, it often happened that the whole team had to work together to resolve something, it's not that new. You're upset at ...a trailer, and the concept of sharing.
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
So Clownfish was right?
O..M..G!!!
The revelation is teela is the main character.
wow....mkay!!
damn thats awful! Is it really hard to find someone else with deep voice for He-Man? This dude sounds like he might go back to his bed and cry when you don't show up on his tea party. SMFH!
Is Tila a man now?
Wait WHAT?, Masters of the Universe: Revelation is premiering on Netflex on my Birthday?, Now I'm sold here.
DoesTeela know Prince Adam's secret? Why does she have this Tomboy-haircut? Why is Beastman fighting with the heroic warriors? I get the feeling Smith doesnt get it - I will not enjoy this series. My enthusiasm iswaning definetly.    Also hearimg "Cercei" voicing Evil-lynn feels kind of awkward. There, I said it: once youve seen GoT you cant un-hear her. At least Hamill does a good job, cause I dont hear "Luke"..
How much you wanna bet that Teela either gets the sword or at least half of it at the end
His emblem is a cross, not an ''h'.
Mark my words, Kevin Smith's He-Man is going to be this year's Last of Us: Part 2, a total bait-and-switch to anyone watching this trailer
This …. Looks pretty great
By the power of Greyskull
making tela a les might not actually be a bad thing, if anything it complements to the story and from the trailer she seems to have so much character. I just hope they don't Side line He-man and turn him into a p*ssy being constantly rescued by her. The show is called HE-MAN for a reason
I AM HEEE MAN
Well if its good as Castle Vania they yah GG Netflix but I swear if you mess this up like that black samurai anime you guys need to stop doing animated series.
The "Revelation" is that Teela figures out He-man is Prince Adam. Kevin Smith has stated this.
This looks so lame looks awesome but from the voice acting and the story sounds horrible.
They should have called this show "Teela and the Masters of the universe" because it looks like This show has almost nothing to do with he-man.
Bait and switch, sorry, this south american here will not watch this show. Because i probrably can predict how it will goes and end.
Let turn a new gen gay! 👌👍👏🏳️‍🌈🥰 it worked on my me when I was a kid.
This is so dope looking forward to seeing this animated series!…..nice one Netflix you may have a winner on your hand!….
Oh, oh, maybe they are right and Teela is now the main character.... If this really happen, i don't wanna hear anymore something likes "why is manga/anime outselling Comics and cartoons?!?!". Bc they are loyal to their own work and don't give a F about social justice warriors.
Wtf is this
Gave me chills! Well done Kev - Cant wait!
Mark hamel, grear choice
...this better be efing good. i'm watching you kevin smith.
I’m so sick of the sjw hair cut.
Really hope this just doesn't suck
Looks like He-man will probably take a back seat in his own show, shame
At this rate we closer to remaking Conan
I was excited before, now I just can’t wait!
Looks cool. Just don't woketard it up, or I'm done lol.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY NOW, NETFLIX!!
Ah, He said it…He said the thing!! 🔥🔥
In the wise words of admiral ackbar “it’s a trap”
More Woke destruction of popular culture.
Skeletor has a boner.
I don't like to use the term woke, but this looks like the woke masters of the universe show.🤦🤦🤦🤦
We will watch the upcoming shitty series. SHITTY!
Looks pretty groovy. Can't wait for it to drop.
*Sheeeeeeeesh*
Furry skeletor final form!!?   Now we're talking!
Hm It doesn’t appear to be what I expected but I’m still excited
1:42  whaa ? Whys Orko hanging out with Evel Lyn ? Ohoo, are they messing up ?
Cool. Yet another tired ass "SUPERMAN TURNS EVIL" trope. Real original. Looking forward to this.
Awesome awesome
"What's your name? B.o.B? So they calling you Bob?"
Oh good the bad guy from samurai jack is in it
Prince “Adam” looks like a girl
Heee man
Ясно-понятно. Нас опять на*б@ли, расходимся. Хи-Мэн для затравки появится 2 раза по 2 минуты, а ГГ - очередная сильная и независимая Мэри Сью. Интересно, кто из старых персонажей окажется небинарным гендерфлюидом...
how come some of the men and women look like each other ?
shout out Fatman Beyond!
Hollywood learned nothing from the all female Ghostbusters movie.
Looks good.
Looks ass
No thanks to yucky girls 🤢 I hope we get to see what we all want: He-man wrestling another strong man and preferably hanging some dong 💪
"I HAVE THE POWER".   DAMN STRAIGHT HE DOES. WHOO HOO HOO HOOOOOOOO.
Silver hawks pleeeeaaaaaase
Teela over here screaming for equal representation in a show called… Wait for it… He-Man.
I heard this is basically "Teela show and oh yeah...He mans here too".
This looks so freakin cool!!! I remember watching the 80s and 2000s versions. I am curious if Teela knows or will know that Prince Adam and He-man are one and the same.
Taking bets since this is done by Netflix.... Who is going to be the LGBTASFHGFD character in this one?
Can't wait
NO THANKS, I'll stick to the original classic from the 80's.
*What’s up? intensifies*
I hope I'm wrong but it smells like its gonna be a woke shitshow
I was so pumped up for this show until I saw that chick with that weird hair cut. This TIHS is going to go woke!!!! SMDH. I’ll stick to my 80s He-Man and the Master of the Universe.
I'm nota kid from the 80s. I mostly know He Man from a money supermarket ad in the uk
Can't.wait.any.longer.
So He-Man isnt the MC?
The real question here is has Kevin Smith stopped smoking weed long enough to produce something coherent?
This is a sequel series. Imma need some She-ra crossing over people.
Anyone noticed that the transformation to Skeletor begins in form of Spikor?
More and more it's becoming obvious this is a damn bait and switch! Time for THE BESTEST EVAAAAAAAAAAR TO SHOW US MEN HOW IT'S DONE! 🙄
Just by looking at her hair cut you can tell a lot.
BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL
PASS!!!
Guess there will have to be a time travel retcon of this, just like the Kathleen Kennedy Star Wars Series.
İts looking borning
The tiger talks now???? 😲😲😲😲
this looks kinda shitty.
Man those are some good roids he has.
Getting hard core Witcher Vibes, and that’s a good thing 👍 oh and Hamill as grey skull 🙌perfect casting
OKay. I don't hate it.
If He-Man gets side lined and it turns into the Te-la I'm out
He-Man revamp...still remember watching as a kid.
que grande torteela
Please do thundercats next
Por cierto al menos he man no estara muerto ya que filtrajes decian que moriria
OMG OMFG this is everything I ever wanted for he-man.
Later in the trailer. It shows Teela having butchcy hair style. Her new hair style looks bad on her.
My show!!!
Looks good except for Bass Pro Teela.
Looks like this should be called She-Male and the Misogynists of the Universe
I've been saying this since January after the Witcher I'm done with Netflix. Not upset at all with you folks you just aren't for me, things change and I can accept that I hope you can too, no need for name calling it's all gravy you understand peace
Qué purete como me gustaría ver ya que buena animación
HE-MAN! The story of... a lesbian with the side of her head shaved, and her black girlfriend.  =Netflix=
Teela and Masters of the Universe ....  Today.
After all these years, I get to hear "I HAVE THE POWER!"
This looks corny AF!
Esta bien hay sacado trailers de series que espero pero porque no hay trailer aun de transformers kingdom
When is Baki
Are these seriously the same people who told us Ghostbusters 2016 wouldn't be bad,  Last Jedi will be great and so on?  Do they never learn?
I haven`t been this excited since I got Castle Grey Skull for Christmas back in the mid 80`s....
They should just use the "eye have the power" from the original. :p
I don't give a shit about Teela.
Muito bom 👍
Great. Feminist ruin another beloved franchise.
Didn't tune in to watch the Masters of the Universe, let me tell you that much.
I will watch, but I'm very afraid.
The teela show..,, I'm guessing 🤔
This looks good I remember the original can't wait and I'm 51
The amount of whining from butt-hurt dudes about Teela being too much of a main character is hilarious. For guys that claim to be fans of the franchise, you seem to be forgetting that Teela is the daughter and heir of the Sorceress. Y'know, the person responsible for safeguarding the power of Grayskull? Teela's angry reaction at the beginning is almost certainly due to finding out about this role and not being happy about it. That's not only a fantastic story hook, it's also based completely on the source material. JFC, get over yourselves, you mewling losers.
watching this the time between July 2 and 3... midnight... wishing it was just 23.
Nothing beats the classic
She-ra?
Why does He-Man have red eyes? And why is he fighting Teela? Did you really make him bad?
not gonna lie, got a boner watching this
Do they broadcast earth media on Eternia? Because Teela just turned into a Karen and this show should be called Teela Master of the Universe and get this over with already
Yeah baby 👍
wait, Grayskull and Snake Mountain are teaming up?! This is new...
Don't know how I feel about this.  Teela reminds me of Wonderwoman when she tears off her crown.  And when Cringer speaks, I hear Snarf from Thundercats instead.
hhahahahah - bait and switch. another failure
To the morons wondering why they think that he Man may not be the main character in this show. 1: Morons, originally it was just masters of the universe before he-man was put into the title and while he is the primary guy in the whole franchise, it's more of an ensemble thing.  And 2: This is one trailer, make a be doing a thing where each trailer focuses on a specific main cast member. It's not until you see the entire part one where you will figure out who is the primary character in this part
And with that the cucking of He Man is complete.
This is cool but what about seis manos season 2 ?
Don't cheer too soon this is going to be PC He-man
I have a bad feeling about this. Anyway is Blackstar going to show up?
Ah, I thought it was gonna be live action 😕
Adam dies, Teela is trans and takes on the mantle of He-Man.  Am I right?  Stunning and brave.  I mean, you gave her the SJW haircut, so she at least has to come out as lesbian, maybe hook up with the Sorceress.
Whoever cut this trailer: "I need to bring it across that everyone could die and the universe will die too..." includes every line about that from the whole series...
As expected this is going to be a woke feminism trash show about the badassness of teela and her lesbian friends. I didn't expect anything else from Netflix.
Omg I'm so excited for this, I hope they make more than one series. 🗡️💪🏻
That undercut....
My body is ready.
HE-MAN seems like a supporting character, and not the protagonist. Disappointed.
Lesbbbiiianns of the Universe
So Teela is the focus of this He-Man show? 🤔 Your pandering is crystal clear. 🤷🏻‍♂️ This will fail hard unless that focus changes. He-Man is the primary character.
Can't wait to watch it. I sure hope She-Ra makes a few cameo's in this series.
Why did they make telia ugly with that haircut?
Its confirmed,  your childhood has been destroyed by the new Woke Revolution! Now go cry as there is nothing you can do to stop it!
Skeletor is still fighting the war on Carbs. Good for you Skeletor.  good for you
0:49 behind Prince Adam looks like Vikor, King Greyskull, and possibly He-Ro!
Cringer can talk huh
Okay, so it is not He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. It is Teela and her sidekick?
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
It does not sound He-man; It sounds like a melodrama. Plus, the animation is bad.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Start the music !! heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa
"Grey skull kottayude sakthi  En ullil odhugum aa sakhthi koodi vaa"
I’m hoping He-Man comes back full time & Teela gains the sorceress’s powers, becoming equals.
YES!
Is it just ne or do we need a Thundercats cameo / tie in?
Reading adult males getting upset about the 'legacy' of a terrible cartoon that was just an ad for a line of toys may be the funniest thing I've ever seen. So emotional.
Some of the animation here looks kinda off does it. Like some stuff looks really good but others look pretty strange.
30 something years later and 80s kids still rock with He-Man. You're damn right! 🤷🏿‍♂️😎😁
*Somethings you can never forget*  That's why we are all here after all
What is it, that every female character has to have the goddamn half shaved lesbian cut?
Absolutely not loving the animation style with this 🤦
Another source of meme
It's a tremendous nitpick, I know - but why did Teela need to nix her more recognizable look to the shaved head/manly getup?  Why is modern day cartoons so scared of a feminine figure/looks? Do they honestly think that the audience would not be able to take a woman seriously as a warrior unless she looks more manly?
I want to like this, and perhaps I will. But I get a "deconstruction" vibe from the trailer., which for me doesn't bode well. But time will tell.
Okay sooooo....we're just not gonna talk about how Kringer was speaking? Really dude?
This trailer has more violence than the entire original series. The strength of He-Man was that he rarely resorted to flat out beating his opponents. He always outsmarted them and let them live to fight another day. He-Man was eternally hopeful they would one day learn that violence isn't the answer. Also he knew he could take anyone out at will, therefore he never really needed to.
I'm just getting bad vibes, about this.
Kevin Smith hated He-Man as a kid....that's why he made this
tela is softer then baby shit
Still 80s he man was better
The feminism female warrior haircut is 🤮
The old but best animation shows are back with a bang 😍
Cringe but Aaaaaawwwweeeesome.
The new intro will be " I am teela the true hero of eternia. After prince Adam destroyed magic it was up to me to become the new champion of greyskull. Now I have the power ."
I'm sorry but I CANNOT take him seriously when he's wearing that little leather skirt
The early 2000 one looked better.
Dear lord i am ready
Super flop
THIS. IS HOW. YOU NOSTALGIA.
She-Man?
I gotta see this NOW!!!!
Que lindo
Teela's undercut hair feels like a major warning sign.
Its very simple. HeMan is going to blow everybody away and will be beloved. He'Mam is going to fail miserable. Your choice NetFlix
Cringers voice sounds like the old mans voice  from the new adventures of he man and dose not match .
why do i have the feelin we all been catfished?
Dónde estás en Español Latino?
He-man will be replaced by Wah-man.
I hope I'm wrong but it looks like some woke shit.  I want badass Skeletor with a maniac laugh. That may save the series...
I'll watch it. Teela having more to do doesn't bother me - I kinda liked her when I was watching it way back when, wished she'd have more lines. Also...  thought she was cute.
How did I know they would find a way to make He-Man the villian.
Wait I joined 6 years ago
Premise seems meh, voice acting seems a bit weak and off, but the animation looks good and nostalgia for original series. Here's hoping it does well.
Looking forward to this. If it's split then could someone else get the power. Got some more waiting to do
Not sure about that new Teela hair cut.
it hardly has he man. its about teela
Ready💪
Thank you!
I hope Mark Hamill wins an Emmy!
This looks WOKE. . . Teela is a lesbian? ?
Teela looks like an SJW wet dream. Bleck
ME gusta mucho HE MAN espero algún día  se junte esta serie con los THUNDERCATS y ALCONES GALACTICOS  QUE SE HAGA UN GRAN UNIVERSO COMPARITIDO ANIMADO
I love everything in this! Except for maybe the female designs. Not that they don't look badass with their muscles and all, but since everything is so colourful why can't they be muscular and have their og costumes. They look cool but they don't fit the tone. I want my campy characters back.
Been so looking forward to this ever since Kevin Smith let it slip on Fatman Beyond WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY back that his talent had been tapped to direct and Marc Bernardin was writing an episode.  As paraphrased Tony used to say,  "This looks GREEAAAAAT!"  I'm all in.  Now if they'd get Kevin the rights to all of the old Hanna Barbara and Silverhawks I'd be on cloud nine.
Was stoked with the need a hero trailer but passing now.
One of my favorite cartoon when I was a kid🔥🔥
I feel like this is the perfect time to remake bravestarr, animated or live action, it really should work what with other shows already proving that bravestarr was quite far ahead of its time
They pulled a fast one on you all. It's just called Masters of the Universe so no one can complain about the lack of He-Man's character
Why prince Adam looks more like a female more than ever
Wtf! Why can't they ever find good animators for HeMan?🤦‍♂️🙍‍♂️
Yeah, the moment she said the sword was split in half, I knew that there was incoming "Woke Hollywood is Ruining He-man now!!" Style rant videos got green lit.
Wooooow! They broke the power sword and went full-circle to  Blackstar!!
They aren’t even trying to hide that he-man is going to be replaced and be bettered by a woman.
"The strong side burns female lead character that has an empowering personality and her sidekick He-man".   I wish I was a vampire, would sleep 2-3 centuries until cringe like this goes back to normal.
Pretty sure this is going to be a let down
I know Teela is meant to be the main character and all but I'd love to see more Prince Adam.
So what's the last episode of the original he-man
imb for today politics and muh women white knighting
This animation is glorious. And Mark Hamill as Skeletor is simply genius.
Kevin Smith has repeatedly said in the past he did not care about He-Man when he was younger. He is not the person you want behind this. He is an empty name that is there to fill a spot for another Netflix agenda show. Get ready for *Teela and the Woke Lesbian Karens of the Universe.*
Less Teela! more HEEE=MAAAN!!
pls dont suck, pls dont suck
or they die or we die or everyone dies lol
If Mattel expects to sell toys with Teela and the WOKE squad there gonna have a bad time...
I m worried , who will be the real protagonist?
Will we see a lesson at the end of each episode? Otherwise, I'm not interested. Thank you very much.
Cannot wait for the Robot Chicken
Too soon for where is Devil May Cry?
Okay so just from this trailer I can definitely see this is more "Teela's" story than He-Man's.
They love shitting on white males characters and the fans who love them.  All I needed to see was one chick with the short hair to know this whole series is more woke garbage.
0:59  Is that King Micah?
Some people might get called sexist for not liking the bait and switch with Teela seemingly taking over He-Man as the main character. I'm pretty sure people would get annoyed if literally any other character, male or female, took He-Man's spot as the main character even though the show literally has his name in the title and the first trailer basically putting him in the main spotlight. I'd be bored out of my mind if this spin-off was about Man-At-Arms for example.
can't wait! I'll be a happy dad watching this with my 7yr old lol
Looks like Thundercats
It's He man?
This looks terrible.....
*"What?"* ~Skeletor 1987
What if there was no He-man in He-man and it was all about a butthurt butch? Fair enough - let's replace She-ra with a polar bear on a skateboard next, it's what the fans want, right?
Yo know shi?$ is going down when Cringer is saying something profound!
We need 80th soundtrack on this... Not an badass drama music
Can't the Karen haircut be exclusively an earth thing and not exist in any form in any fantasy/fictional universe
These people ruin everything. Geez. Give up on old IPs and forget about nostalgia. It’s as dead as Star Wars. Clownfish vindicated.
doesn’t look very good.
why is He-man not the main character of this series? what nonsense!
This looks great but this isn't anime style like its claimed to be.  Its more like warner bros DC animation.  With that said still looks great.
Looks amazing!!! Thank you sir!!! Me and my kids can’t wait.  My only nitpick is Teela’s hair.😀
Battlecat talks NOW?
This looks epic!
So... The Sword of Power is going all Blackstar on us?
not looking too good for he man and the masters of the universe. was expecting the old show but re made. honestly show might not be good
Mjjjjjum..... smell like a Feminazi shiit
So the council of Rick came from this?
So let's see. Adam loses the sword. He-man goes evil at some point people spouted it might be Faker but considering the times, its more likely He-man is evil. Cringer is now spouting great wisdoms. Orko is a casting bad ass. Yup this isn't our MotU.
Nice
Needs more lesbians :(
At :49 seconds you see what looks like past he-men. (King greyskull, He-ro, wondar, maybe?)
Couldn't put He-Man in the title. Don't worry Netflix, we understand. Lmfao
This is bloody EPIC. I got so sick of the haters...now how will they swallow their pride to say this looks fuckin great?????
There's a lot of hints in here of He-man turning evil or being sidelined if he gets done dirty in his own show im not watching it.
Why is Teela a man now?
This is going to be Teela of the universe .. Kevin smith is a liar
I'm surprised they didnt make He-man black.
How.... does this tie into she-ra?
Yeah its a Teela shit show... F U !!! just F U !!!!
This look Gay
No more hates for that show !!!  Many people who was born in the 80s should be hyped to see their own childhood rise !!!!!
Looks dumb. I think the 2000 remak was far far better than this iteration
Netflix, whatever you do, do not make the Avatar live action movie

My husband and I can't wait. If you all remember waking up early on Saturday and eating your fave cereal and watch your fave cartoon. And it so happen to be this one and Thunder cats.
Nope.  That's a hard pass for me.  The true hero was always Prince Adam.  Not that disgusting roided out Teela.
"Say the line Bart."
Okay, Netflix is def. on drugs now... Love it!
I just hope they don’t make this a bloody and gory show like with Castlevania and blood of Zeus. I like Castlevania, but blood and guts just doesn’t mesh well with the He Man mythos. Just keep it at least pg13 or lower.
They better have kept the theme tune.
ok
Y el trailer en Español con la voz de Rubén Moya ?
Stunning and brave!!!
THIS LOOKS BADASS!!!!!! I hope its good
I have a feeling this is going to be less about He-Man than we initially thought.
They are using 'Stinkor'!!! and at the very least Prince Adam is still wearing lavender tights and thus will receive those 'fabulous secret powers'.
She Man and the Masters of Feminism
Please dont make it a girls Power séries with lots off PC shit
Why all remakes have very stupid and inelaborate? İf you cant make a new iconic music, take the old one and make new version. İts ok to take everything from old cartoon but not music. İts very stupid. You should have even made netflix letters like filmation enterance. You are doing this for over 35 years old people, not for new kids. So do what they would like.
I HAVE THE POWER........  my childhood super hero
Hard pass on this....
What's the point of calling it Masters of the Universe if it's about Teela? Just name the show after her! Don't have to trick people.
Was the voice at the begining Lena Heady (Cersei)?
Lol.. a "strong" girl with typical SJW's haircut and a Prince Adam with no muscle who looks like a woman... nice Netflix, nice...
Where's Stratos and Ram Man?!
Was this...AN EVIL HE-MAN??? Man i am hyped!
Not watching it until I know this is a He Man show not the Teela show and all this trailer does is make me more concerned it’s going to be a Twitter tv show
Looks like Orko is getting the shaft again.
But is he still a “Rainbow Warrior “?
Please make a AAA game for He man,something like God of war.There are just so many characters in He man and it will be so much fun.
I guess the idea that it was a bait and switch is true.
Yeah, I wasn't interested... Then I saw stinkor... 1000% EXCITEMENT
This isn't going to be some woke BS is it? Is it going to pay respect to the old cartoons?
I for one am excited for giving the others, you know, the masters of the universe, more protagonism.
Brabo!
DAMN, now do Thundercats, Cartoon Network kinda fuckd it up :c
"AND I SAY HEYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA"
My childhood favorite show “Teela and the Master’s of the Universe”
It's fine I guess but without Shuki Levy theme playing over the action it all just feels dull.
Ffs 23rd of July!!! I actually can't wait 😭😭😭
The animation certainly is looking better than last trailer. Now I for sure am excited.
powerhouse???? powerhouse???
Stop right there...I'm in!
More Teela than He-Man.
Oh sweet, a He-man show with wimpy He-man! Can’t wait!
Still waiting for Extreme dinosaurs and Street Sharks but who am I kidding. That’ll never happen 😔
The story is about He-Man but Teela and Illena get more screentime in the trailer, guess I know where the series is going to head.
Netflixed
This month is going to be so freaking epic!!!  With Transformers Kingdom and MOTU:R.....OMG
So..... Is It a he man show or a Teela show?
I like this dc movie art style for He-man
So the sword was divided. Somewhat similar to the original toyline where Skeletor and he-man's swords are like two sides of the same key that unlocks castle gray skull. Also reminded me of that other show where the main character and the antagonist wield half of the sword they have that makes it whole when in contact. And as for Teela wielding it, great. This is exactly what the other YouTubers feared. Adam gets side-lined.
Looks cool, wanna see. The only sad thing is, as expected, the poor comments, made by the even poorer souls that got brainwashed by clickbait-channels and outrage-farmers that prey on the immature, weak-minded men that are afraid of everything ... funny enough most of those will not even have watched the show as a kid, otherwise they would knew it was always kinda SJW ... just look at the post-ending messages to the kids about tolerance and forgiveness and all that...also Teela always ruled. If you are under fourty and complain, just shut up and watch a bad video about how Last Jedi and Rey ruined Star Wars or some nonense like that...
This looks a thousand times better than the original series, which to be honest featured very poor animation. But fans continue to nitpick story elements for a show they haven't even seen yet.  Internet fandom sucks.
So what I get from this is He-man is a *side character* … not interested. Thanks for ruining my hype Kevin Smith! Ya LYING SNAKE!
The only way I’m watching this is if the women are weak minor characters and the men are strong central characters. We don’t want a She-Man! We already have one in the White House
Damn.....so it really does focus on Teela rather than He-man...I'll still hold out hope
I love how this music is trying soooo hard.
Teela with the woke look does not bode well for the show.
Hopefully, we get Thundercats next....
Weird, I thought this was focused on He-Man, not Teela and her lesbian friend adventures.
Solid trailer
Welp classic bait and switch
Can Smith do Thundercats next
All I know is Orko & She-Ra better be in this reboot!!🤷🏽‍♀️
Holy shit, I have a strong desire to buy action figures
Publicidad engañosa la protagonista es Teela y su "novia" , He Man muere en los primeros capítulos.
Teela became a Heela o.o
Awesome until this season started  I hope they made another season of the masters of the universe
So... This being a sequel to the original series, is there anything I need to know about beforehand?
Man, I see so many toxic ass comments on here about Teela being the MC.  These same people probably hate She-ra too 😂🤣😂
Oooh look how tough and manly Teela is. She'll destroy this evil toxic excuse for a man called He-Man
I swear, if He Man is killed in the beginning of the season . I’m done.
So, it's TEELA & THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE now...
Adam looks a little girly, but the preview looks great otherwise
Yes, yeysysyejsnc
They Them Teela and the Masters of the Universe
Skeletor:      "WHAT?"
This is simply He-Man and friends.
sjw trash. try again netflix
Genuinely more nervous than excited about this one now...kinda seems like the characters histories and their roles have been changed 🤔.  🤞
Dude, SPOILER !!!
Hamill is terrible at Skelator
Huh I didn’t expect to see this, He-Man returning. I have to admit I was expecting to hear Corrin’s voice(Cam Clarke) from Adam, not this one.
Yep must see finally
Pass.... I see the bait and switch coming with Teela taking the spotlight over He-Man. Why do all of our Male heroes have to be sidelined and replaced in their own Respected,well earned positions by a Girl with a shitty haircut and a major hate boner against Men?
Is this gonna be He-Man or Woke-Transman?
Skeletor!
This is going to be soo badass
For goodness sake stop complaining and saying werid BS about woke and Tesla. READ the dang title! It’s about all of them!   IDOITS!
I'm still skeptical. This better not turn into the Teela show or fans will be pissed.
After seeing the comment section, I search this "heyayayaya" thing and OMG.. WTF
Was that She-ra or not? And why aren’t both of them in a movie at the same time if the stakes so high lol
Esse trailer se resume em uma palavra: Perfeição
I love you Netflix
Tá porraaa menor
Can we have a season 3 of The A List
Had I seen this trailer first instead of the "I need a hero" one, I'd never have gotten this hyped. Just hope it doesnt destroy the whole He Man legacy.
Is it he-Man but with anime animations
He-man
Me singing tune: He Man na na na nana na na I HAVE THE POWER na na nana na na na nana na He Man 🙈
Love it! Can't wait!
Please let this be good, and not the woke garbage we've come to expect...
Why does this have the same music as the ads on Crunchyroll lol
A Teela's series...noooooo
BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL :)  time has come to witness something AMAZING on July 23
Where is the mighty battlecat
He Man is for kids of the 80s. Give me Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and I'm good.
Battle cat can talk????????????
So basically, He-man is Teela's submissive
I'm stoked and all but... WE NEED THUNDER CATS WE NEED THUNDER CATS WE NEED THUNDER CATS!!!!
I miss women in entertainment. Even the puritans only wanted plain Janes, not men missing equipment. When did we start hating women? This is going to be a giant turd sandwich
To idiots who can’t read; The show is called “Masters of the Universe”. Meaning it’s not just Adam’s show, it’s for the WHOLE CAST
I'm just glad Cringer talks this time!  I missed talking Cringer.
For God sakes. Just give He-Man a sheath.
The first trailer was really good, even for a bait & switch. But this trailer is just bad. Disliked.
Look Teela is cool and all but the story they are going for feels like its better suited for She-Ra. But ya know, Noelle Stevenson apparently owns She-Ra now. :/
Anyone else thinking about the chances of a crossover of She-ra with her brother?
"Twenty five years, and my life is still trying to get up that great big hill of hope. Or whatever that means."
So this is just another She-Ra show? Butch She-Ra 🤣 I liked the early 2000s one better 🤷‍♂️ Fake and gay  But not in the fun way.
Battle cat talking now 😳
my boy stinkor!
I was excited about this till I learned it is actually about Tela and not Heman
I guess all animals can talk now...thanks Brian...
Ok that gave me goosebumps.  In spite of all the controversy I have to say this looks good. Here's hoping I'm not disappointed.
This better not be woke. I
Isn't He-man like stupid strong?
É isso aí Netflix 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏
Animation is superb, but looks like that bait n switch is real, focusing on short haired teela instead of he man. Her original design much better than this stupid butch design
Of course Teela has to be covered up and have a Karen hairstyle....
From what I've heard, this ain't gonna be about he-man
Sooo this isn’t about he-man?, got it
the first few episodes is to grab us with nostalgia but then after it it will be about teela and get super woke. no thank you netflix.
Shite
...sigh, I guess He-Man is now female centered. Doesn't surprise me. Heaven forbid we just have a better version of the original..without the agenda. Pass!
TAISTELU JASKA!!!
SOY UN TROLASOOOOO
........ I feel like I know 90% of the plot
So he-man  is now evil is every super going to have an evil storyline I mean seriously from superman to captain America even goku has a canon evil storyline; JC man.
You guys put out all these anime with only one season and some only have 7 episodes how bout finishing one before Making another one
Its funny how people don't realize that He-man isn't going to be the main character.
This looks amazing, They got Scare Glow in there. And Cringer giving advice to Adam! I cannot wait!!
it sure looks like woke he-man to me. not interested
This is giving me the 2011 Thunder cats vibes. Cant wait to watch it!!!!!
HEEEEYYYYEHHHHHEEHHHEHEH
Hm IDK, she ra was sooo amazing, but that? Will se
Please call He-Man by He-Man. It’s 2021. Next thing you know they’re gonna call him They-Shim or Eric.
Its the first time a toy series becomes cannon
So it's gone be Teela show? Starting to be a little scared. Don't mind Teela spinoff. But I want Heman in Masters of the Universe show. Time will tell.
Is that Lena heady's voice?
A tv show made by Kevin Smith, maker of tusk
HE HAS THE POWER!
So this isn’t a He-man show? It’s a Teela one?
All I remember are the he-man memes.
Por favor Netflix!!! 🙏 No llenes este producto con política identitaria. Recuerda que tu público meta son personas de más de 40 años.
The animation is a bit choppy and the angles/camera is a bit static. But great character design and colour coordination!
In She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Adora's Father is BEN TENNYSON!!!!!!!!
Netflix you suck, another series you're making progressive,  get stuffed
Feminism is a sexist cancer against men. Note how She Ra remains for women but now He man is taken over by Teela, a woman no one wants to see.
Why is it that every new female character has to have the horrible buzz under lesbian haircut in order to be a "strong" female character? Does looking like a guy somehow give them more power? Is it like the reverse Samson? It is honestly getting to be pretty ridiculous.
So ya'll really went back into the library of deep toy lore to find any reason to make He-man share his power didnt yall. Hopefully the show is done well, based on this trailer I doubt it but I hope for the best
Is this for real or are people being dicks & giving me less reasons to live
The fact its not called he man worries me that he won't be focal point
It’s funny how many people are triggered by this trailer and I bet a lot of you have He-Man and She-Ra action figures in your collections.
Not a fan of Angelina Jolie lips for each character but other than that, looks epic. Def going to watch.
Still wish they could've secured rights to use some of the original theme music
Meh…
Thank God there is a POC main character!
This beats Thunder cats reboot!
She-man?
It’s the 21st century…but it’s also 1984, Im 5 years old, and suddenly this thing called an Action Figure is before me…and he has green tiger? And they fkn what!?! And the bad guy is a skeleton?!!! Feels good to be a kid again 🔥🤘🏾😁🤘🏾🔥
Why?
Little do you guys know 💀
Canceled after first season. Just watch.
Karen haircut 💇💗
i need more orko!
From what I'm seeing in this one, they'll do something worse than sidelining He-Man: Adam will only be able to become him IF Teela lets him...
Do anyone else have a feeling that a lot of She-Ra fans are going to hate this for a very dumb reason or something?
Looks a little too heavy with Teela and a little too light with He-Man. I'm excited about the series but come on, Netflix.
*My understanding is that He-Man is to play “second fiddle” on his own show to Teela who is apparently the real protagonist in this show.  Female empowerment and feminist agenda will be the main focus of this show as Teela saves Eternia along with the bumbling white beta male SoyMan….err He-Man.  Cartoons these days are getting a gigantic injection of SJW Politics and He-Man is no exception.  The story will focus on Teela and her leadership and not so much on He-Man who represents the “white patriarchy”.  Kevin Smith has all but confirmed the above…so I am not sure if this will succeed.*
Why is The Sorceress telling Teela ANYTHING about the Power Sword anyways?
HE-MAN
so the rumors were true :(     I'll pass.
Thank you Kevin Smith for this!!
Remake del heyayeyayyey incoming
Why do modern women in fiction have to have the but h lesbian haircut with the shaved side? Like why, what's wrong with a woman having a full head of hair or shit at least short hair that doesn't look stupid?
Okay the first trailer was cool but now I am getting worried. Why does this trailer not seem to focus so much on He-man? Like I get it they want to make the focus on another character but why? It’s called “He-man” even in the name it’s a masculine one. It should be mostly targeted towards men. Netflix does not have enough shows targeted to masculine men.
Why doesn't he have his original emblem on his battle harness? Is it because it is the Iron Cross?
Why does it feel like a "Rey Skywalker" it's TEELA and The MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE....you know, steal it, don't earn it. The Power Sword is Pure Power....It will be, when it's wielded by a Woman!
Don't get excited people, this will not be about He-man. It will be about the women
I was hoping battlecat wouldn't speak, I never was able to like the talking cat. Makes him seem less treating.
He Man better be in every episode. No bait in switch to Teela as the main character.
Yikes, those voices...not good! Also worried now, it looks exactly like what Clownfish and Protocutura were saying it would be. Hope I am wrong!
The real question is will they still include the fourth wall breaking life lessons at the end of the episodes?
I NEED MORE ORKO IN THESE TRAILERS!!
Looks very woke
i have The power 😍😍😍 He-man
Stop lying to us! It's 'The Teela Show.'
Just try to pull some woke BS here and I am done....
The Teela Show featuring He-Man
I don't know. Western productions don't come close to anime quality wise.
I’m sooooooo excited that I was tricked into getting excited for a show that hides Teela behind a facade of He-Man.
No. This is a disgrace. Cancel it. Truly disgusting to see.
Je veux Bob Lenon à la vf de Musclor
She-Woman and the Masters of the Universe (ft. He-Man)
New trailer so they can say there was never a switcheroo?
Kevin Smith, my how you have fallen 🤡
Ok Kevin, I see you! Much better trailer!
Como lokita, sapeee!!!
Who's the dude who stole Teela's armor?
Sending good thoughts and wishes your way ❤️✨❤️💮❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨
HEYAYAYAYAAYAY
this is so weird its like humans in medieval ages with modern technology mixed with magic lol
So it seems like Teela lost faith or was disillusioned. The story is her rediscovering her faith and rejoining He Man and the fight.
It looks so good... but Kevin Smith is going to ruin this with Woke Crap, and Netflix will give up after 2 seasons, like everything else they do. We all know how they ruined the last season of Voltron.
Another woke piece of garbage. He-man and the Mistress of the universe is what it should be called 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
CANNOT WAIT FOR THE WOKE DISSAPOINMENT. You'll dumb if you can't see the pandering out here....Remember. I be the one that said I told you so.
Teela was using magic in one of the scenes? she gonna be the next sorceress of Grayskull or something?
me trying to become a super saiyan say "I have the power"
Teela and the teelas of the teela
Can't believe they brought He-man back. Skeletor better have funny one liners
Better not be a bunch of woke garbage.
Cannot Wait! Come to me NOW!
Well looks better than she ra or thundercats reboots
Those muscles hummana hummana Hummana!!
How he don’t slice his back up pulling that thing out
We shall see. It’s like aspartame. When you know it’s there you can taste it, feel it, resent it. Just like when you can sense the wokeness. Nothing but strong feelings of disgust, resentment and disdain for being poisoned & subverted.   Im rooting for Skeletor on this as it seems he’s fighting against the woke fascism of the alt-left tyrants.
does this He-man also feels vertigo in the tail?
Please dont mess up he-man.
if this is a Teela show i will cancel my subscription 4ever. enough is enough Netflix
Kevin Smith would probably have wanted to use some of the robot chicken material.   He-Man says to Skeletor, "You know what you need? A good skull f***ing!"  Skeletor, "Wait! What?!"
Why does this look like its about Teela and not He-Man?
Confirmed: He Man/Adam is riding Bitch on the back of Tela's Motorcycle. I mean Batte Cat
By the power of GraySkull!
wasn't the quality same 15 years ago?
I am not liking how teela looks
I'm checking this out, but I really hope it's a Masters of the Universe show, and NOT the TEELA show as it's been rumored....
Can’t wait to enjoy this show with a bowl of cereal, sitting way to close to the TV
My childhood!
Why all the girls look like Abby from Last of Us 2 😭
Top das galáxias
We all know what they’ve done here.
I hope this show will also have PSAs at the end of every episode, because these comments make me think nobody who watched the original show was paying attention.
This is sure to make a couple people VERY happy
Damn these kids are fking spoiled. Look how fking awesome this is.
Glorious
I love Mark Hamills Acting but he sounds like Skipp from Regular Show and The Joker.
Esse desenho não é do he-man , é da trans Tila ,da sua amida afro americana e do gorpo homossexual , mais uma série Do politicamente correto e do empoderamento feminino, infelizmente será uma bosta
1:58 "Y SOY UN TROLAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
Master of universe? Isn’t that South Korea? It is known they have already applied the world heritage for it.
That looks freakin rad, now que douche bags to claim there's a bait n switch. Can't wait for July 23rd. The useif both filmation and comics is fantastic so hoping Teela becomes the Godess.
🤣 Woke He-man where he plays second fiddle to a female lead in his own show. Hollywood can screw up a wet dream.
So it is a story for teela, man you shouldnt sell the series as a heman continuation if it is about teela, better sell it as a teela story instead dont you think?
The "bad ass woman being just as physically strong and masculine as men" bs is really getting tiresome. It works ok as a novelty but gets the eyes rolling when you make it the norm, as it doesn't in any way correspond with reality. And why is it that Netflix can't find strength in feminine female characters?
The power of anabolic steroid.
Teela will probably turn her back on magic and then become the new Sorceress (since the Sorceress is her mother).
I remember a long time ago when I was in kindergarten this girl try to steal my He-Man lunch box. I was so upset that I hit her with a Fisher Price block😄 Anway, I can't WAIT for this series!!!!!
Skeletor: NYAAAA
0:28 "Breathe it in."
It was cool to see Adam with the other "He-Men" of the past, but you know some people are gonna have some issues with King Grayskull. Lol
A He Man show where He Man is a secondary character. No thanks.
Wokeness of the universe
Why does this look like a Teela coming out story instead of a He-Man Kicks ass and saves everything story?
Where’s She-Ra ?
That haircut has me concern 🤔
Skeletor looks so money supermarket
As Biden stands in the White House holding a 5G programming crystal scepter screaming I have the power!!!!!!
The Teela show pfffff garbage
I just hope this won't turn out to be SHE-MAN and the mistress of trans-verse.....
Kevin Smith is fuскed
I hope they sneak in some meme acknowledgement into some episodes
Never thought I would see the day when Cringer was the voice of reason.
not even about He-Man he loses his powers and the girls take over as the heroes more sjw bs👎👎👎👎👎
The cloths looks shit and the design is far inferior to the old he man master of the universe
He man is just a back drop now!
When did animation studios just give up on animating?
I like the fact that this time they've made Adam skinny. In the original there wasn't much of a physical change.
oh wow ... looks alot better than I thought it would
wow can't wait ;) i am 47 now feel like  I kid again lol
S*** b**** I can't wait until the masters of eternia  comes out cuz you know me I always was  into the he-man as a kid
"still know the tune?" "some things I will never forget,  hey yeah yeah yeah hey yeah yeah, what's going on?"
Who on Earth votes something like THAT down?! Stirring stuff!
1:56: ¡I.HAVE.THE POWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!.
Very much looking forward to this
I hope He-man doesn't lode the spotlight
Looks good and the animation looks great but at the same time looks idk a little bit feminist! I hope that the real lead character of story will be He-Man.
TOO. MUCH. MEMORIES.
One thing I love about this age of animation is that we've gotten far enough away from the days when shows like these were originally done to sell toys to kids, and are now being written AND animated with entertainment as the primary goal. Even better, it seems properly aged up, without leaning too hard into the tried "Dark and Gritty" territory.  I've never been the biggest He-Man fan, but I'm down to see how this plays out~
Molar better be on this one!
Think I'll pass. Make a He-Man show and I'll watch....
Hot damn.
So, basically this show is literally just a toy ad?
Calling it now... This show will go the same route like the Voltron remake
This show should be called She-male.
what should happen: You didn't tell me you were He-man! I'm sure you had your reasons lets go fight skeletor.   whats going to happen: You didn't tell me you were He-man!! How dare you waaaahhh! I'm gonna go find a Girl friend!
Looks cool, could have used some more frames per second tho, looks very very choppy and basic.
Okay guys. We have to go hard to support this if we want to finally see the movie.
Ngl, lowkey hyped for this.
I see a lot of Teela and very little He-Man, and almost no Skeletor.   Put me down as skeptical considering the last few reboots of beloved childhood memories.
The animation is really smooth
When I saw the first trailer I wasn’t impressed. Was still going to watch it. But after seeing this I’m actually excited now! Animation looks pretty clean!!
If the way he shouts "I have...the POWER!!!" doesn't amp you up you're dead inside
inclusive :( :/
Can’t friggin wait!!!!!
The bait'n'switch has been set. Teela and the Alphabet Squad will be the protagonists of this show. Brace for impact.
i'll never forget he-man kicking superman's ass
It's not gonna be about HE-MAN
So I'm seeing... Early loss of he-man.. moral relativism with the villains working with heroes... And he-man having a role as an enemy.  I'm thinking... 70% pass
OMG...the tears...bro...this looks amazing! ❤
IVAN!!
it's hilarious
Wait... so... Kevin Smith lied, and Clownfish TV channel and their source were right? But Kevin Smith wouldn't lie to us, wouldn't he?
Yup definitely sidestepping He-Man
He-Man, just give us He-Man
So good hearing Sarah Michelle Gellar's voice.
IT should be called the teala show not heman
I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Teela apparently would like to speak to the manager of Castle Greyskull.
They should have used the original audio of "I HAVE THE POWER!" ... it's still the ultimate expression of those words and has yet to be improved on... can we start a petition for this? 😆
It looks great!!!!!!
Well done all.
I can't see Baal
No BLOOD!!
Wait, I wasn't old enough to watch the old he-man but I saw the early 2000 one and did cringer always talk?
Welcome to the Lesbian Captain ´s Adventures! Feminist Teela is the star now!
Himen: Ja imam moc 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Que clase de ejecutivo s 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦 ignorantes..
Not another SJW nostalgic 😢 fuckery Netflix and can't you just leave us in peace
Heman has died. Will Teela and their girlfriends of Grayskull save Eternia and the fate of the entire Universe? Pay Netflix and find out.
They using the name he man as  precedence to push a trash Character storyline....
Teela and the Masters of the Universe! Guest starring some guy named He-Man.
It still looks like it could be good.
So the rumors are true. Sigh...I don't regret canceling my Netflix account at all
Powerhouse Animation are really stepping into the spotlight, all we need is season 2 of Blood of Zeus and Seis Manos
Yo quiero ver a Hitman. No a una mujer. Además las mujeres no miran dibujos de acción.
Woke nonsense
If they do the same thing here that they did to She-Ra…I was looking forward to this series, not so much now.
And now just make a video game similar to skyrim or something.
Excelent!!!!!!
I dont' care.. I liked the She Ra reboot. OFCOURSE ima watch this!
This will either be fantastic....   Or it will be yet another piece of subversive garbage to destroy nostalgia and drive away fans.
1:56 I HAVE THE POWER!!⚡️
Looks like it was the Teela show all along and kevin smith lied.
This shit gonna be 80 percent about a Character called shera don't get tricked
So is this the Teela show?
that "FOR ETERNIA" at the end could have used another take. that just sounds bland, uninterested, and phoned in. come on, give it some oomph! (and maybe less of whatever accent is causing you to overpronounce those Rs)
Looks like there going to ruin He-man
I never understood why they made Stinkor from Merman with a new paint job. Stinkor is a skunk, not a fish.  So I am even more surprised that all this time later, they decided to keep that going.  I hope they put those two in the same room in the series just so they can look weird at each other like "Did we have the same mother or something, because dang...  We look like we could be bros, but... nah..."

Don’t want to prejudge, but this series feels like they are making the same mistake as the 2000’s reboot. The Voice Actors sound weak and generic. Even though the 80’s cartoon in retrospect was silly, He-Man and Skeletor’s voices were iconic. These voices sound vanilla.
Can't wait to see He-Man making guest appearance in his own series...
Please upload NARUTO SHIPPUDEN
Más bien...
Plz do something about your anime they all look the same plz hire a better team so much titles but lack of talent smh plz Netflix step up your anime
YO .....He Mans back ✊✊✊
Yas!!!!!!!!!!
The next season will be call She-Man and the Masters of The Universe.  She will be bigger than him when she finally use the sword.
we get a new hee~eee man remix?
Lookss amazing.  Please don't mess it up with the 2021 inclusiveness junk
i have a Bad feeling He-man will be on the first episode, then lose his sword, and you won't see him but only in Prince Adam form, i saw the leak video where Teela is called "Man At Arms" still hyped for the show!
Littlefinger as Kringer...
still looks like the tela show with he-man as her sidekick. loving everything about it except that.
Wow now that Teela is a proper lesbian she is way stronger than when she was a female hetero...awesome!
"Hey Teela-" "Don't call me that anymore! I now go by the name ... Karen!"
Cringer needs to be Cringier..... But hey kudos to Kevin Smith for letting us relive our childhood ❤️
If this was on Cartoonetwork it would be cancelled after 1 season and rebooted in Chibi art form with fart jokes......
He Man seemed like a side kick. This seem to be Teela heavy.
I was already going to watch it I don't need bribing but if you do a season 2 snakemen empire plz I could see them battling the masters with giant titan like monsters from the lost depths of eternia
"gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more" :-D
oh snap, that made me smile...
Actually the animations are much more defined than what I watched back then when I was younger. I will take it into account to watch it. 👌🏻
Netflix better not turn He-man and She-ra into Them-an and They-ra...
This will be settled in a...       MORTAAAAAL KOMBAAAAT!!!
Not interested.
Another franchise bites the dust
Whatever they did to teela looks soooooo bad. And Adam looks like he's been in a coma. Even the 2000s one wasn't that thin. But I get differentiating between buff Adam and Buff He-man. But it's not like Adam didn't know how to fight so why did in the interim of whatever happen, he didn't become more like He Man without powers and instead skinner. The opposite should have happened.
puta que pariu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gay
Hopefully since she ra was a Gay series, Hopefully the next one could represent Straight Pride as well
Oh, God, they were right. It's bait&switch.  I was really looking forward to watching He-Man again. 😢
Another Woke BS
Why only 1 season?
Hope u guys use the original theme music 🥲
Trash.
Looks like its a Teela show..... but i guess we will wait and see...
Cautiously optimistic.
Where these fk is SHE-RA!!!
CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Adding this to the list
Looks woke to me. Ew
Like the fact that it looks like He-man is still around. The action and animation looks amazing! Still not sold on the over muscled re-design of Teela. They could have done better!
yare yare daze
If anyone here plays Dragon's Dogma on PS4, look up Kodaisosen for a He-Man Pawn.
so..what I got from this is.. He man turns evil. The sword of power gets split, and looks like one half goes to..( oh look, 5 bucks says half goes to a girl, woman, or person of color/whatever else identity polotics horseshit)   Golly no wonder you aren't calling it He-Man, you are doing him more dirty than Luke got shafted by Rian Johnson.
Yep the official trailer shows you it’s all about Teela and that He-man probably turns evil. And let’s not forget that the sword is divided meaning she will get the other half and will turn into the new she-ra and he-man. WOW so unpredictable!
She-Man
something tells me adam will play second fiddle in this
Please, for the love of my childhood....please don't reboot this series with Tila as the lead character? Enough of the strong, feminist, woke crap. It's called "HE-MAN" ffs
I use to make fun of people who liked this show because everyone in this show looks like they really wanna get into a strip club called "Jack's tool box" or "Put of the closest"... Turns out, I still think this is a very... Oh nevermind times are terrible these days, cancel culture is just waiting for the opportunity to destroy someone's life. The shows animation looks good but my God, this is a very... I'll leave it that.
Oh they’re doing the toy lore now.
I wonder how much gender politics will be shoehorned in to this
Teela looks like a dude . That is all .
I thought it was going to be about He-man. But it's about Teela. The old bait and switch ladies and gentlemen.
jak go zastąpicie kobieta to wam nie daruje
This is just  what the world needed in these dark times
Looks dope as hell
just make sure  you all keep in mind  stay hopeful its good but be prepared for disappointment its the 2020's and its only gone down hill so far.
Who is the red hair guy ?
Cuando saldra la vercion en español latino
This looks bad ass.
I remain unimpressed.
They better impress with this Teela arc
Nostalgic
Ok but what about thunder cats
The cat mount with the armor always looks badass
Well... If all these rumors are true, I´ll not be happy without some g.o.g-action between Teela and She-Ra :)
Need to make a movie of this thirty years late and im not talking about dolph lundgrens version
Man, Teela looks so lame with that haircut, is like she is yelling "im so basic and follow trends"
Its a teela series, well edited trailer netflix
It’s looks hyped hopefully it stays that way
Ok, this is epic
A sword seperated into two pieces. That is too much like the cartoon Blackstarr.
The first world in creation huh? That's a good way to start a fantasy epic xD
Is he He-man??
Woke garbage. Teela has more screen time than He-man
Holy shit this is so good!!!
Cringer talks!! After the awesome 200x series, it is good to see he can talk again! 💚
Todo se ve épico... menos Teela, que ahora parece hombre
Awesoommmeee
How do grown men get so salty about a cartoon they haven't seen yet. No one sucks more than anti-SJWs
Bro that head does not match that body
They should have dubbed the old "I have the power", but overall looking forward to this.
I HAAAAAAVE A Woke Feminist  Bob Cuuuuut! I mean POWWER!
WHOOOOO!!!
Well the leaks apparently were real im skipping this. Also changed that like for a dislike.
Nope
*crosses fingers* please be canon the that gay She-ra cartoon...
The bait and switch is real.
BY THE POWER OF GRAY SKULL!!
i know they are going the HAHA, teela is the heroine of the show and not prince adam, but i ll give it a chance.
Masters of the Woke-Universe.
Still doesn't beat He-Man Christmas special.....that really happened.
Sorceress buys the farm. She's not in this trailer
Why transformer does not look 👀 like this?
Himan!)
Please don't be a woke bait and switch... Please don't be a woke bait and switch... Please don't be a woke bait and switch..
Looks like Teala wears the pants in this relationship.
Cringger seems to sound brave unlike the 80’s version
This looks like a nice reboot
If She-ra makes an appearance, I will most likely die
So how woke is this show really going to be?  Surprised they left Master in the title give the sensitivity levels of today's world.
Pronoun-Person!
Oooh Scareglow! Nice!
Now this looks bad ass!!!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🔥🔥
please be it a respectfull to the original.. and not a woke shit show
Cringer sounds a bit more sophisticated now - and less cringery.
post op teela
PLEASE DONT BE WOKE. PLEASE DONT BE WOKE. PLEASE DONT BE WOKE.  Please don't be WOKE like She-ra.
I'll be waiting for the eventual "Go woke go broke" review.
THIS IS GOING TO BE GARBAGE, THE TRAILER IS A BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!
The sword split into two, sounds familiar. Only an 80s kid would know this. There was a previous cartoon called "Blackstar", where the *Power Star* (name of the sword) was split into two, namely *The Power Sword* wielded by the villain (Overlord) and *The Star Sword* wielded by the hero (John Blackstar). It seems like Netflix's He-Man took a page from that cartoon.
Plz don’t f… this up Netflix.  Sorry but you are good at it.
Another bastardized classic, Shitflix ruined one more
I still have my castle greyskull, my snake mountain, and most of my He-Man action figures
Pumped!!!!!
Teelas haircut is terrible.  Her outfit with the haircut makes her look like a man.
Awesome... love it
I dont know why I have the feeling HE-Man wont be the protagonist........
Loco más vale que sea he man el protagonista no me vengas con boludeces
Woah they made a show about the “heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa” Guy.
Remember Kevin Smith swore that He man was the main character and it is not going to be the Tela and girl friend show.
So this is that meme.
Interesting, The duet HeMan-Teela look similar  with the couple:  Trevor Belmont-Sipha.
So was Kevin Smith / Teela wrong or right?
Woke?
I saw Eternia at 0:04 and instantly became a fan of this series.  Talk about fan service!  I just hope they're as faithful to the lore as they are to the eye candy.
Don't care, it's not about He-Man
I'm getting flashbacks to the 80s but I'm loving it!
The Sword of Power was divided? So that means Teela gets to dual wield like in my Skyrim games, right? YAAASSS
why does every "strong independant female" main character have to have that same damn haircut like jesus
“Oh no there’s a lot of Teela shown and she has a haircut and she is standing next to a girl this must all equate to her being the main character and clearly a lesbian…so that also equates to it being a bad show” seriously people calm down. 1, stop judging it before it comes out, 2, stop expecting it to be the same show you grew up with storytelling has evolved since the mid 80’s, 3, it’s called Masters of the Universe if they only showed He-Man for 90% of the show you’d start complaining the name was false advertising. Then again this is the internet so faceless people will complain to complain, if you end up not enjoying the show that’s cool everyone’s entitled to an opinion but give it a chance first, if you go in negative your more likely to look for “flaws” rather than actually just trying to enjoy it.
Masters of the Wokeverse
We'll see
Is it just me or does any one else notice that they replaced the cross on He-Mans chest?
The Real She-Ra and the evil, bad, wimpy HE-MAN. Where’s spanky and alfalfa?? Maybe Eternia will finally wake up!! Getting Woke is sooo in Vogue!! It’s like today’s MULLET… totally radical daddy-o
"I HAVE THE POWER !!!!!"  tutu tututu ... tuturutututu turutu tu tu.... TU TU TU ... HEMAN !!!!!!
Woah, this looks great.
Exploiting He-Man’s weakness seems like a good story telling device. Most of He-Man’s allies do not need magic to fight.
buh....buh....how does a super lesbian come to the rescue of Eternia and save it from the evil dastardly Patriarchy?
Wait is this a sequel instead of a reboot?
Why does this always happen? Everytime I search an old movie or serie to have some nostalgie, I always find a Netflix trailer of the same movie or serie 😂😂😅🤔
I think the first half of the first episode is going to be awesome and then the rest will be boring and awful... as always...
So, do I have to catch up on the whole series before this or?
Producers:  So the sword splits in half New He man fans: That's dumb Those of us here from the beginning:  Ohh Toy line Easter Egg.
Nah Tila is the hero of this show now.  I love how they made her look like a man.
Never seen Stinkor looks badass. This series is already a hit.
HELLSYES
Of course lesbian haircut and a black girlfriend, what a surprise.... not. Why make a He-man show that is not about He-Man.  Let me guess He-Man represents the patriarchy and why Eternia is doomed and now must be saved by lesbian energy.
holy shit
It'll be better than Q-Force that's for sure
It lacks the original soundtrack...
The old Filmation He Man and She Ra is still the best!!!
Looks intense
THEY-PERSON
This is gonna be awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bleh. An intersectionalist bait and switch with outstanding animation. No thanks.  Maybe if you guys would stop wearing beloved cultural touch stones as skin suits to push your socialist agendas I'd be willing to give this a chance.
Yeah no...nice try Netflix but you can't hide the bait and switch anymore...this is more like Teela and He-Maams rather than He-man, She-ra and the other characters...
Fantastic, now somebody edit this trailer with "I Need A Hero"
Glad to see they have a talking Cringer in this show as its the only thing that annoyed me about the 2000 series.  I look forward to checking this out as it looks really good.
I am SO here for this.
It looks like Skeletor's strategy is to destroy the universe and create a new one with him as God
He-man!
Looks great, sure hope it isn’t some bait and switch advertising itself as He Man but with Teela as the main character for some reason.
Man, this looks rad. Tons of allusions to past versions and canons. Feel really badly for the "how dare a woman do a thing" fragile bois.
Offended Hipster Teela looks so out of place here. Everything else looks epic.
Holy shit, those youtubers that put out that rumor were 100% right. He Man will barely be in this. The story is actually about that chick with the half shaved haircut. Damn, I was hoping that was a lie.
This looks really good
Wai wait wait I thought this was about  he -man why am I seeing like it's about some women empowerment movement vibe
Cercei that bitches voice in the beginning...lol
Thanks Kevin Smith!
Where tf is Dolf?
Dangit. I have a convention to go to the day after this. I'm going to of course have to benge every episode and fall asleep on my drive the next day!
Why make he-man the bad guy? Let me guess she has to save his soul? Or sumthing like that? 2021 hey.
Can wait for this so I can forget about the shit they served us with the record of ragnarok anime
Lovely
Is this a Kevin Smith film?
Cringer talking is newer to me
Yea, yes, yes, an Eternia of yes! So much MOTU from across so many years…I simply can’t wait!
1:39 JOKES ON YOU !!!
Are you serious? Is this a joke? You have made He-Man a side character and from the looks of it an antagonist. This smells like feminism. Please don't insert your politics into this beloved cartoon.
So it's basically Teela's show cos she's like 3/4 of this trailer. Rename it to She-la.
I thought the split sword cartoon was Krystar or something like that.
SHOWWWW, MARAVILHOSO. ANSIEDADE A MIL POR HORA.🇧🇷❤️
Kein Smith likes anime
I heard this is a woke pos. The animation looks good, I hope the story isn't some preachy garbage. I loved He-Man when I was little.  I hope it's not riddled with woke propaganda!
CANT FN WAIT FOR THIS!!!
This looks soooooo good!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ OMG
Hopefully its good
They better not make He-Man gay
Bait and switch, people, this isn't about He-Man, it'll be about Teela. Not watching.
What!
I dont remember him going from a skinny guy to a brawny guy when changes with sword. might as well call it a reboot kinda.
totally back and forth, top to bottom GARBAGE !!!
Love this! Excited for the series to start!
Hummmmm...... Still worried and skeptic…. You better not turn this classic into a postmodern She-Ma’am.
Wait??? She-ra and He-man are connected?? BRUH
🔥🔥🔥🔥 I'm excited
Cant wait for all the salty tears of people who denied the evidence  of Kevin Smith making Teela the main character along with her gf while He-Man is pushed to the side.
Soooo, it's really "her" show now ... The articles were right and these trailers are misleading. Shame.
Where she-ra?
Please NETFLIX make this series about HE MAN, and not about we all know who 🙏
The end gave me goosebumps.     I just hope they dont woke ruin it, but Ill be more mad if they do.  Not because its woke, but because the woke will have gotten smarter at hiding their degeneracy to get people to watch it not knowing the bait and switch about to happen.
caraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiii
Like it looking forward to that ☺
He-Man’s power is over 9000!!!!
Finally, we'll get Teela's badass show
Wokeflix.
Oh, she's an atheist now too? 😂😂😂
WHATS GOING ON
The angry lesbian will save eternia!
Does anybody have that She-Ra vibes?
Adam looks like Celine Dion.
I want more Q-Force
Joke on you I'm into that shit
I can't wait for the Skeletor memes
I hope that I heard mark hammil as skeletor!
Needs more Skeletor. He's the only reason I'll be watching this.
Wow for once, I can actually tolerate Cringer's voice despite they let him talk again.
At least you guys aren't baiting anymore. And honestly, this trailer looks good. So why'd you bait us in with the other one? Caused more controversy than you needed.
Another woke crap....
Não gostei. Tiraram o símbolo do Vasco. Sacanagem.
He-Man looks like he is not even the main character in this and Teela is.
Also surprised it hasnt been renamed HE Woman
Seems Teela is sporting a lesbian look. And why do I have a feeling that she's the main character instead of He Man.
I guess what Clownfishtv said is true then that will be the Teela show and not about he-man like the lies that Kevin Smith said  many time that the show is all about he-man that is the main characther but the main characther that is shown thought out the trailer is Teela. The animation look awsome but i feel the same traps is happening again like most fictions these years
let me guess: he man will die and give her strength and power of great skull. he-man won't be the main character for the next sseasons. other show ruined !!!!!!!
Love this already looks like it's following the theme of castlevania son of Zeus and the rest
Los pelos como escarpias 😍 toda mi niñez va a resurgir a mis 44 años. Thanks netflix
Ah yes, Teela needs half of the fookin' sword to be as cool as ekhmm.. HE-MAN
I.. have... long pOwErrrrRrrrRRR!!!
Why would there be less of He-man in this one? They better put a "I have the power" shout every episode.
I also need Thundercats!!! For the love of god make a movie and make it kick ass! Christopher Nolan should also direct them movies!
como siempre ahora en estos tiempos con su inclusión de a huevo porque si no lo haces no vendes y cortes de lesbiana a Teela
We don't need woke motu...
Woke He-Man huh?
Rumor has it that only the first ep is really going to have much of He-man in it. It’s basically going to be another girl power wankfest riding on the coat tails of a popular male character.
Noffa
Finaly this time he man is gonna get out of the closet
God bless Kevin Smith for convincing Mark Hamill to come out of VO retirement to voice Skeletor!
idk if they will give this series the mature and more adult oriented treatment like Castlevania but I really got some Castlevania vibes from this, mainly from the animation.
never understood how heman could be forgotten like that, I hope there will be real hype again and also good video games thx netflix :)
I'm just amazed that He-Man hasn't been reinvented as a non binary, black, lesbian female in a wheel chair.
I'm getting second fiddle vibes for my boy He-man.
Teela is getting the other half of the sword: She-Man and The Masters of the Universe 🙄😒
Só assisto se tiver discurso motivacional/moral no final de cada episódio.
bait & switch........ so the rumors were true.
Her hair is stupid.
The more I see of this, the more the rumors Clownfish TV heard comes to pass. The more Kevin Smith lying to us becomes clear and the more disinterested in this show I become. The art animation look good at least.
Oh yeah, bait and switch
Hopefully there is nothing woke in this series!! It looks good so far
Those ladies have sure been working out. You would have to be seriously jacked to call yourself He-Man in their presence. Since when was a woman looking feminine considered to be so wrong? This is true misogyny rather than the woke variant of that word.
I don't know...not as good as the first trailer.  This is looking a little more like what people are fearing.  Fingers crossed it's not.
Tee-La and the Mistresses of the Universe.
Teela what have they done to your hair!!!
Something's, you really can never forget.  I have the powerrrrrrrrrrrrr.
So It really will be a bait and switch, Dawn you Kevin Smith
why do every woman looks like a dude wtf
Skelators voice reminds me of Alex Jones "evil voice" lolol
From the Creators of Castlevania and Blood of Zeus.
We are going to need many Jan Michael Vincent as we can get
The animation is awesome, but why almost no Heman or Adam? This trailer makes it look like a story about the adventures of Teela.
I hope it's like She-Ra!
Really don't know why people are complaining about He-Man potentially not being front and center, there is a time skip that seems to have had him lose his powers, and Netflix animated shows tend to have a slow start and build up either mid season or season 2. Just look at Castlevania. Nostalgia can make people so butthurt sometimes.
Yeah, I'm going to need this musical score released asap
I feel like modern hollywood has been absolutely terrified of macho white men for the last few years. So much so, that you can't even think about rebooting or rebranding a franchise with a lead such as that, without some asterisk attached: A female lead to be the REAL main character, retconning them to make them LGBT or making them die/ turn evil so a diverse posse of side characters can take center stage. *sigh* but no trends in fiction makes everybody happy. I just can't wait for this to blow over, personally.
Going down bitches!!!!!👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Will his sister she ra be in this?
Please don't go woke.......
If Kevin Smith is involved, don’t expect too much guys and gals!!  JS… 😬
Please be good Netflix is the worst😭
Finally some honesty, it seems most of leaks are correct, but at least Teela blames Magic and not patriarchy. Still have hope
SOY UN TROLAZO ME GUSTA EL PEDAZO LA LA LA LA LA
I wish She-Ra had this kind of animation
wow looks good but woke im scared for my childhood
Cue the bait and switch ...
This show DESERVES our viewership!
Feminist Teela saves the Universe while He-Man is a side charakter in his own show.
All I expect from this series is that someone recreates the HEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE meme from all those years ago. I would, but don't have the editing skill.
👌👌👌 I have the power 💪💪💪
Freakin' bad!!! Yyyyeeeeeeessssssssss
Hmmmm, this doesn't seem different from what was 'assured' at all.
This looks sick and I have chills. I'm 44 years old and I was playing with him in when I was four. I had about every character. Every castle. Every vehicle. I had an entire toy box the size of a recliner chair filled with He-Man stuff. I hope this is good cuz I'm really excited
what the hell happened to teela? it looks like she learned a lot from critical race theory and ready to tear appart the patriarchy
Oh good! Another "Teela Show" trailer.
Lol   He - man’s the bad guy
I will make my 5yr old son watch the original He-Man first, and ONLY THEN will we watch this Netflix Series!!!! Who's with me?????
Teela and Masters of the Universe (with a He-Man cameo in the first 10 minutes)
So it'll follow an agenda after all.
*she*-man and the masters of the universe
Teela rocking the gender studies degree haircut. I'm assuming she now has a girlfriend on there.
Wow, so Teela main character, He-Man gets his butt whooped by Teela, and He-Man is not about He-Man. Uuuuuuuurgh, great juuuuuuuust great….
Ight who gonna be the first one to say it..   Also where tf is my thundercats reboot, the CN one not the 80s
It is pu f****** !!!!!
So it was really about Teela searching for the power sword of woke to became SHE-MAN???
Spectacular! Give us Thundercats too! 😉
I smell a very "progressive" wind coming over Eternia. Research the Maoist doctrine of replacing the Four Olds. If Netflix did it to She-Ra.... they'll do it again.
So this is where Shalamayne came from...
SHE MAN is back!!! i mean he-man is going to in it for 1 ep
Wow! So He man is a side character! Damn u Netflix
He Man
Oh, He-Man isn't going to die but lose the ability to turn into his powered form (before you point to the evil He-Man, Tesla was pulled into a big well which could be like the Dark Side tree in Star Wars.) and it looks more team oriented as well.
i always said...No Live Action for HeMan....just a bad ass High Def animated movie would be awesome
I guess it is s follow up to the 2002 Cartoon series and giving it the proper ending it did not get when Cartoon Network Canceled it after Season 2
Did Skeletor just announce Diablo? :)
Netflix the Best 🏆
Parece que agora acertaram. Não mudaram nada, só melhoraram o que já era bom. Ansiosa pra ver.
So where's Adora?
By the power of Greyskull!? 😮
After all this time and Skeletor has kept his teeth cavity free just in case of a reboot. That's being extra prepared.
Right as I could feel it getting to the end I just went "He'd better say it.." and then, sure enough: "I HAVE THE POWERRRR"
Everyone is looking forward to this but sadly its not about he-man at all it's all about the women in this show I'm telling you now the woke lot have shit all over he-man
This looks awesome I only hope the rumours aren't true cuz coming from a fan of the original that would be really sad 😢 to see...If it is I'll most likely unsubscribe from Netflix only to sub again when the new season of Witcher comes out.
This is going to be like MGS2...we think that we are going to play as badass snake, since all the trailers had him in it....instead we were forced to play as girly Raiden
MY BOY ORKO!!!
Would have liked to have more of the 2003 series art style
So...this is teela story right? She even fights an evil He-man? Not sure this is what I was looking forward to to a continuation of He-man. Hope I'm wrong and prince adam has just as much screen time and character development
Kevin smith is an icon
Captain Planet,Freakazoid,Kid Icarus,Metroid, Starfox,Dreamworks Rise of The Guardians And Cool World Need Netflix Series!
WAH-MAN guess the bait and switch rumors were true
00:44 This is weird how he is carrying his sword!
Why does He-man transform like Sailor Moon? 🤔😅
WTF did you do to Teela?!  Talk about wrecking excitement.
So it's true, it's going to be a woke garbage take on how Teela saves everybody with her stupid haircut.
apparently this trailer is bait, He-Man isn't the MC lol.
oh look. They lezzed out Teela.
Damm He-man it's not a Joke anymore
I think Heman was the name of the cartoon
The woman voice narration sound like need acknowledgement from the viewers.... I sense danger
1:58 *What’s going on intensifies*
HYPE!!!......Now do Siverhawks!!!
Did Battle at talk?
My favorite show is coming back awesome!! And my nickname at is He-Man too.
If this is the best they can do for the trailer how bad will the show be
Só vem, fiquei até arrepiado!
*ഗ്രെയ്സ്കൽ കോട്ടയുടെ ശക്തി..!* Anybody?
Netflix CEO’s beating off rn
Dude is on all kindz of steroids
Nice ❤️
My WOKE app on my phone is in the Red Zone meaning He Man will die and the Women of Eternia will be the warriors with  Teela as the new He Woman or He Person or She Man as the New Leader with her fellow lesbian soldier as her Queen.
My fav childhood show(All Hail HE-MAN)
Teela the He-Maam
Feel like this show is a WOKE show. Get WOKE go BROKE
Let’s make a he man series and make it less about him and
Why do these weirdos think all gay women have that crappy shaved head haircut? You can be gay and not look like a damn man. Stop stereotyping lesbians.
When I was a kid I use to this cartoon on tv
allot of teela
We have the power!!!  Netflix Yes
Trolo man
"I! HAVE! THE POWERRRRRR to respect all women and treat them like queens" - He-Man July 23, 2021
Omg there making heman a girl power movement. Jesus im getting sick of this woke . i am woman hear me roar . 😔
I was excited…
Looks like we are getting Masters of the Universe: Politically Correct Teela Show because He-Man is the definition of Toxic Masculinity. Thanks Netflix for ruining the only chance we had at getting a good reboot of He-Man.
Excuse me, but I am over 30 and I somehow feel this ad is targeted at me! :D
"I used to be He-Man and only serve the patriarchy! But now I serve women! Call me... Herman!"
Seriously does every female heroine have to be a lesbian now?
It's going to be a woke trash!
Someone give me a remastered original story for he man so I can watch this and understand please
Good, there not gonna write He-Man out of the show, he just doesn't have his powers. I'm actually excited now
For a second I was wondering why queen cersei was narrating this
Please bring back the old song. It's a must. He man dah dah dah dah dah dah dum.....He mannnn. Animation looks dope, the story is good but need that ummpth with " I have the powerrrrrrrrr... And it echoed".
this is such crap,  biggest bait and switch, putting Kevin Smith right up there with Rian Johnson. How far the man has fallen from clerks and dogma what a coward.
The tiger talks
BAIT AND SWITCH - 101
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😊
He-Man needs to be rated R the kids got Ninja Turtles the kids got Superman kid got Transformers the keys got Batman leave something for us adults let's face it no other generation got into He-Man like we did
SIGN. ME. UP!!!
Atleast Netflix is being 1/2 open about how this is gonna be The Team Alphabet Show. No senseless last minute shoehorn like Voltron or single episode randomness like Alucard.
You now have the HEYYYAYAYAYA song stuck in your head
Please don't fcuk this up Netflix.
So everyone was right. Teela is the main character.
Gaaaayy
Teela sucks, and not in the good way...
Holy. Shit.
Why do I sense a bait and switch? He-Man and Skeletor won't be in it much and it'll mostly be Teela?
Boring 🙄 this would've been good if He-man was the main character but no instead they are tricking people with these trailers
Well...Prince Adam of the '80s looked more manly than this new version.
How does Adam look more womanly than Teela
Why is Teela more masculine than Prince Adam?
I'm pretty hyped to watch this with my nephew,  I was all about 80's cartoons, and He-man was one of the best.
Shit, so this is going to be about the empowered independent woman with the shaved head and not about HE-MAN, right?
a He-man show where Teela and her GF are the main character, why not call it Teela and the master of the universe feat He-man... Just saying. not mad i just dont want to be misslead. Im really excited for it just the tittle bothers me. they should've gone like avatar  and legend of korra 2 great shows diffrent dirrections thats whay im saying.
behold the new she man  show
My childhood hero 😻❤️🤘🍻
I heard HE Man becomes a bitch in this series and a female bailed him out. Could have had given She Ra her own series where she kicks ass but that's not good enough for the Twitter mob
I'm a little iffy on this. Sure, the visuals are great and it seems a LOT of the supporting cast are getting decent screen time, but... I dunno. Something feels... off. It's too perfect. I don't trust this.
Teela show ft heman?
I'm cautiously optimistic. The trailers look great, the news about this series...less so. The Teela man look is raising a few flags, but I'm hoping for a good time and good show. Please don't screw this up as so many have done with other IPs.
Bait and switch this woke trash will burn before it hits the screen
I HAVE THE POWER
Im starting to get a little worried after seeing that karen haircut
give a like if you stopped the vid the moment you saw them divide the sword of power, whether because you knew what that meant in the future, or simply because this sounds as dumb as a box of doorknobs.
The nostalgia!  I miss back in the day watching Teela's Adventures
Is it true that this show is going to be about lesbian Teela and her previously white but now black girlfriend instead of He-Man ?
Oh, this is gonna be woke garbage for sure...
The pizza he man EAT IT! AAAAHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Please be good!
I'm a little worried about this... I see way too much "I'm a strong woman" scenes on this trailer. This better be about He-Man.
If this becomes the Teela show instead of the HeMan show, I'm done. Already heard he's either going to be killed or corrupted, and since he has glowing red eyes in this trailer, I'm assuming the corruption part is confirmed.
She man! There will be no He man, as it has been woked.
Okay, I'm interested but I have never seen any Masters of the Universe stuff before 😭
Cringer's voice is all wrong. I'm out.
Awesome!!! 😱😱😱
Looks like a huge pile of Woke crap. As a fan of the 80s original series, I am disappointed but not surprised.
1:40 That skull's eye blink 😅
Please don't fudge it up...
That looks terrible. Animation is well done.
Exciting stuff 👍
pls don't make he man a side character
If this was Disney HeMan would be black and gay.
Gotta love it...Using nostalgia to get points across.  When will people wake up!!!
Wait. They're making He-Man the bad guy? 😔  Nah I ain't gonna be negative, this WILL be good.
Wow!!!!!
Who allowed Chris Wood to voice He man? What a terrible choice.
It looks good, butt........ We will see.
I'm just glad he man still looks like he man, it's Netflix after all.
We will see how this goes. I love that "I r bad ass woman" haircut is here. Can't have our main character not look like she enjoys the fish platter. Shrugs.
Please don’t ruin this with Whamen power crap.  No way in hell Teela could hold her own against He man.  (Corrupted, Faker, or otherwise)
How much of this is going to focus on Teela instead cause of Hollywood reasons
Yeesh, even the trailer makes it look like the Teela show.
I can't wait to see this!
One of those revelations better reveal skeletor as uncle  keldor
tusk!
So they finally took the mask away and show openly the show is about Teela with enough screen time of He-man at first to lure in the real fans.
Wish they had the old voice actors
What's the point if HE-MAN will be replaced by teela. Lmao
Wait the sword is divided in two? Let me guess, Teela is getting the other half, right? Is She Thor all over again and it's lame.
Please please please don't be a sjw cringe fest
Ugh moral story overkill and calling the universe creation...... skip
THEY'RE DOING THE THING!!!!!!111
Yo this looked badder than the hottest woman ever😄😄😄😄 I so can’t wait to watch
teela looks like a man (feminazi) XD
If this show is woke, this is gonna be the death of He-man.
Looks great
and i said HEEEY EY EY EY EY HEY EY EY EY  I SAID hey what a pretty cool trailer
He-man is only in the first episode. He gets killed off and replaced by Tela and the whole show becomes a cringy sjw feminist mess. Don't bother with this bait and switch
STINKORRRRRRR YESSSSS AAAAAA
She-Ra looking pretty He-Ra these days...
Yeah man, looks pretty awesome. Looks pretty-...  1:50  AAAAND HERE COMES THE HYPE TRAIN WOOO!
I dont have hopes for this after the leaks
Hope they make talespin and ducktales aswell
I don’t know what the fuss is about. This looks incredible!
HEYEAYEAYEAYEAYEAYEA
Netflix's He-man  no He-man, only Teela
This was supposed to be he man, not an excuse to in power women that’s what she ra was for
And all the concerns people talked about just came true in the trailer, BIG surprise there...
this on netflix it's going to suck
Oh god, Teela is going to be the main character isn't she?
Queen Cersei got a voice gig. U go girl.
Wow 💯
Waiting for the other shoe to drop...
Damn, this actually looks really awesome
Hmmmm looks great…but let’s wait and see.
I'm 43 and my 6 year old self is giddy with excitement. BTW, Teela still looks as smoking as I remember from when I was a kid. My first crush.
I hope Netflix makes a new gi Joe renegade season 2.
So as a kid they fed us 30 minute commercials for toys every day after school without us knowing.   nearly 40 years later we get what we needed.
IVAN EL TROLAZO
This is so bad. Feels not like MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. Kevin Smith said it years ago. He dont like HE-MAN. Here is the proof.
Nice to see Dave Draper finally getting his own animated documentary
🤩
when did the lion speak.?
and they made it woke. pass.
Ah, Adam is second fiddle as confirmed.
Kay
When I 1st heard they say the sword was split in two, I thought they were setting up that we would get She-Ra in the next season. Hope this team does Thundercats next.
Animation is top notch. All I want is for Skeletor to say "My powers are beyond your understanding"
Looks interesting.
Okay I may come back just for this.
I know I am being greedy, but now I want Centurions back as well and with this kind of animation!!
I want everyone to remember this is also the name of the original fanfic that became 50 shades of grey, let's just hope it's not as bad
Looks very good, but people are saying He-Man isn't even the main character and the girl is, so chances are it's not gonna be what we hoped it was.
!!!BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!!!
Red eyed he-man?  So evil he-man gets saved by lesbian white female?  Pass
La señora relevante , cambia vidas, muy significativa con su cabello de reggetonero futbolista desencaja  super mal, pero todo lo demas se ve muy bien.
man this new season of she-ra is nuts
NERDGASM!!!
Please bring this series in hindi
So adam gone darth Vader with mark harmill voicing in the show. Also are they making teela gay cuz I can't see a young adam with a clearly older teela unless Netflix is doing the whole older woman and younger man relationship.
Are you guys high? I dont know about this.
Any reboot of Masters Of The Universe that can make Orko look like a total badass deserves a chance.
You had me at Mark Hamill.
somehow this feels like yet another set up to failure..  oh childhood .. what did you do to them?
Gee He-Man/Faker fights Teela I wonder who's gonna win the *YAWN* suspense is killing me
I seriously see a bait and switch happening in this trailer. They show HE-MAN and all the other favorites, as the main chunk of the trailer. But sprinkled in are cuts of the real main character. Side hair shaved skull chick with a chip on her shoulder (against men calling it now). Go ahead and hate me now in comments. But when it comes out we will see who was right.
Spoilers= revelations refer to how much we will be dissapointed when we see that we were baited into this show with false promises..
I am unreasonably hyped for this. lol
Another hard pass for me!
Please don't be woke. Please don't be woke. Please don't be woke.
Looks fantastic! but just one little nitpick, who's idea was it to make Teela look like a dude?
I'm ready to see Teela and The Masters of the Universe
Just call it what it is Teela and the masters of the universe
Too bad this movie is 'Woke' by making some stupid random bitch the main character instead of friggin HE-MAN
They did bait and switch. Sadly Kevin Smith lied to us again.
This looks fantastic, where are all the manletts upset about "woke" He Man? They all seem veeeeery quiet on this comment section 🤣
Something tells me they've nurfed He-Man in his duels with Teela lol.  Also, He-Man's sword in the 2002 series was WAAAAYYYYYYYY better and suited him. They should have kept that big blade!!  Hope this isn't a flop, always been a fan of He-Man since I was a boy. 🗡️
watching this for Mark Hamil as Skeletor
Noice
He-man is a side character??? How disappointing…. It’s the Teela show….   To quote Han Solo… “ I got a bad feeling about this….”  The new trailer shows it.   Huge MOTU fan and now hope is lost…. 😞👎🏼
This is how I live my life.
90's kid hero back awesome
Too bad it’s not about he man, but as long as he survives I’m good
"He-Man" Nostalgia ❤️
I hope that, besides main characters, this movie will also find time to show the life and society of common eternians. It’s interesting to see how usual people live in such surrealistic world.
This looks like confirms the rumours... PLZ!!! Don't suck...  Hope lvl: As low as Eternia's Magic
Smh changing the story to please everyone,
pica das galaxias
Ive always wanted  to watch this when i first heard that 1 phrase...  Now i get to watch it! Thank you netflix ! 😃💙
Remember kids, Steriods have short-term gains with long-term consequences!
this looks great!
I dunno, man. There's definitely more butch lady than I remember, which is cool and all. But it doesn't feel quite as gay as the original cartoon. Where're the "fabulous secret powers"? Gamers are ruining He-man.  I guess there are more rubies in his harness. That's pretty gay. And the fact that he still even has a harness. Phew, still gay on that one. And he added more wrist accessories! Love. Having all kinds of friends is also pretty gay. Straight men usually hangout with very similar people.
Can't wait!!! It is so gorgeous!!
While not all, the trailer definitely helps in putting some, if not most of my fears to rest.
I didn't like the trailer but my erection sure did.
Well, the more trailers I see the more I noticed the show isn’t about He-Man.
LET'S GO!    WE NEED A HEROOOOOOOO
This show really likes the swing your partner and throw them to do something epic action shot. I guess the heros have to do that alot since they all seem to be melee builds.
Oh hai mark
!!!!!!
I should be able to like this more than once. Damn
Is He-man still the main antagonist or Teela? Anyone noticed for man at arms?
This *I have the power* is all wrong The classic one was best
Soo He Man is just the bumbling sidekick of Teela...and eturnia has to get along with each other or the magic of friendship will die and people will be sad ..... I Hope its better than this trailer
He-Man:¡ I have the power ! Tilda: uhum He- Man: oh yeah rigth   ¡WE HAVE THE POWER !
🖕
Ugh... trash woke storytelling disguised behind cool-looking, but superficial animation and action.
What I really want this to introduce more robot chicken skits of skeletor.
So many people don't know this isn't about He-Man yet, this is a show based on Teela.  And it's going to suck.
Oh hell yeahhhh!!! This looks super dope!
Now all we need is a Thundercats remake
Hold it for say you mean to tell me that in this remake Teela knows Adam Secret? This series is going to be very interesting
Filmation Forever
"I HAVE THE POWER!"  Gonna yell that when I get my second Vaxx shot.
I am watching this
Oh yeah the show where He-man is gonna sandbagged early on. Can't wait
So He-Man has wimpy voice and they changed his chest-symbol. I kind of feel sorry for kids in this Brave New World.
I wanted assassin's creed, But this will be more better.  Edit:- i take it back, please bring assassin's creed.
But a new orchestrated remake of the Classic He-Man theme would have helped more. Maybe they're holding that back.
Nice cartoon series
As a 31 year old man child I will be watching this
He-man sequel or pre-sequel
Get ready to see He-Man getting cucked and humiliated in the first 10 minuted and Eternia be saved by Teela and the power of Angry Lesbian
Stanley Tucci voice: Oh My Gaaaaaaaahed!!!!!!💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'll watch it. That's the most I can honestly say.
wooooaahhhhhhhhh
This is more Looking like a 2002 reboot then a continueation of the original cartoon 😢
ok i lost all interest.
Intresting
Orco? Was that Orco?? I'm invested!
Visual reminds of this other show with that super hero guy. What's his name again......ah right it's  *Audible Title Card* INVINCIBLE *Audible Title Card*
He-Man was my first toy/tv show obsession as a kid in the 80's.  This looks pretty damn good to me, one of the reasons I'm keeping Netflix around for now.
Looks like the Tela show to me. thumbs down.
I got chills
ohhh... alright this could be good
That was probably all the screentime He-Man gets
gaaaaaaaaay
*YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS*
Idk but I'm getting major Henry Cavill's Witcher vibes!
SKELETORRRRR THATS MY FUCKIN BOYYY
So, It was woke after all...
I hope he man is the protagonist and not teela . Why nobody's talking about those woke rumors , i am not paying Netflix to watch Teela I'm here paying Netflix to watch He man Kick some ass and it better stays that way .   I don't want no woke stuff let the man Heman be the protagonist  don't ruin masters of the universe please
Wait, I'm confuse. The controvisy was wrong from the first triler but now it look like it was right from this trailer??
Netflix is getting serious with it's animations
The other sword goes to She Ra!???
I think its fair to say my prediction was true, but I'm less worried now and more interested in what they have accomplished.
So the true trailer finally comes out.
Now that's a trailer.
He-Man definitely knows that people die when they're killed. Also the animation looks sexy! But I do hope He-Man getting evil Superman'd ain't going to take so long because everyone is looking good and deserves that good screentime!
The Teela Show! Staring Teela! With special guest appearance by He-Man!
It would be so hilarious if they spun this off and did She-Ra again. Actually I hope they do that and do She-Ra right this time.
Meh
So stoked!
Oh my god
This looks incredible!! So many secondary characters included too. NERDGASM 🙌
പഴയ ആ ഒരു ഗുമ്മില്ല
You tell Mark Hamill's trying not to do the joker laugh when he did the laugh with skeletor
Who is this chick and where is he man.
SOMETHINGS YOU NEVER FORGET. "ADAM"
Why are there black people and no asian people? Why do they show preference to them?
Nice! Please Netflix also bring back Thundercats!
Wonder where the bait and switch will happen and it becomes the Teela show.
This better not be she-ra 2.
Idk man. I hope the rumors of this being false advertising isn't true.
“Still know the tune?” “Some things you can never forget...AND I SAID HEYYAAAHHEYHEY.”
Looks incredible! This 80's kid approves!
Stupid,  He man is the main character not Teela
Is it true that He-man is just a side character in this?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍can't wait let's go
Anti Sjws: Kevin Smith said theirs a feminist twist. Ugh, this is gonna be shit!  Me After watching: I dunno guys looks pretty sick.
Yes, when you come out with Thundercats??
ah, yes, a woman cannot become a hero and fight unless she cuts her hair first like a lesbian. what a trope....
You furry fool , I know and I won't disagree. But their one thing we don't like and it starts with He...MAN. Oh no I don't know which way to run or turn.
"Still know the tune?" "Some things you can never forget...  THUNDER!  THUNDER!  THUNDERCA----- Ah shit, sorry, wrong show"
Everyone is going to be disappointed when the rumors turn out true and the story focuses on the chick with the lezbian haircut and not he-man.
Hope they’re no Woke BS in this.
Wow 😳 my childhood memories of He-Man came back to me.
This is gonna suck so bad stop pushing HeMan in thumbnails and trailers when She Thing Teela is gonna be the main character stepping up looking like a bro. So disappointing
Still know the tune? And I said HEEEEEYY YAAAA HEYYYY HEYAA YA HEYYYY YAAA HEYYY, I said HEYY
OMG Vykron, He-bro and He-ro...I think, not sure about He-ro but that was definitely Vykron, talk about fan service.
teela is clearly the main character./.. she was my favorite in the old show.. but she looks too muscled here
Something new, can't wait. :)
This Teela show looking dope.
I have no doubt in my mind that this'll be good
Geliyor gönüllerin efendisj
You guys are going to turn this into woke garbage as well. If Teela is made the main character and you turn her into a butch lesbian with a black lesbian girlfriend then you will get backlash.
Skeletor is back 🔥🔥🔥 lts get a Thunder cat show after
And there were all the whiners before this…
Where's Snarf?
Heck yeah Skelletor looks badass
The show is called Masters of the Universe, not He-Man and the Masters again... the title says it right there that this is not He-Mans show. I get it I have been here for it since '82 but I think it is more than fine that the others get to shine and not just He-Man. That being said I really don't need another show to tell me that men are bad and ra-ra girl power... so please don't be more of that. I love a strong female lead with a good storyline lets hope for that and not a SJW type thing.
I've heard the rumors that He-Man WON'T be the main character of this series anymore... I'm sad to see that this is indeed the case.
This is false advertising, don't call it He-Man when the main character is Tila and her girlfriend. I was hoping Kevin Smith was just goofing but this trailer solidifies it
Worst voice casting for Teela. You couldn't get someone who sounded like a woman?
From all the fuss everyone was making after the first trailer came out, I thought Adam wasn't even gonna be in the series past the first episode which would act as a prologue.  Honestly as long as he's still in the series and working with Teela then I"m good.
and i say heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa
Its a bait and switch. Teela is the main character of this show.
Hope Netflix does a Berserk adaptation, it’s so long overdue 😔
Is that Mr. Hamill I hear???
MYP Adam: Do you you even lift bro?
My childhood in a flashback
That guy is either Konan the barbarian or thundercat 🚶🏾‍♂️
Will we have Etheria and She-Ra making a cameo at least?? Pretty please... 😢
And then Jay and Silent Bob show up
I guess this confirms the rumors. It will be Teela's Show and Adam/He-Man will be side lined... Thats an easy skip for me.
It's just missing one thing............The ICONIC theme!!!
This looks soooo great!
was that cersei voice at the beginning ?
So its confirmed. Teela centered series with He-man being pushed aside. No thanks,.
Thank You Netflix 😭😭😭 for doing This Waiting  30 years forThis ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where's my Sorceress?
Man that thumbnail is very misleading.
Looks more promising than Netflix's She-ra
From heman to this guy🤣
Gonna say it. Teela is hot with that hair
So Hyped!
SO its not a He Man show lol
if he-man the man character of this or that woman? there was a lot more of her then him in this trailer.
Lol Teela has a Karen haircut.
I'm definitely watching this!💯
This is the first thing I have seen that made me question whether the Tela main character nonsense may actually be true. She said she was to save eternai in the trailer, she crossed swords with an obviously mind controlled He-man. And the story about the sword being split could be used as a catalyst to de-power he-man long enough for tela to take center stage, or even use one half of the sword of power herself.
Yes!
And so the truth is revealed. Teela the She-Man comes.  The destruction of a hero begins. Enjoy everybody.
So The Joker, Fire lord Ozai and Skelletor just to mention a few. Hammil is an absolute legend
Finally, after 30 years of waiting, we get to see what happened to Teela! Oh and He-man will be there sometimes.
0:23 hope this is a chic
By looking at this They said he man would be out of commission Not adam
Old version "I  Have The Power" has been better
#1 reason to give this show a chance : so in the 80’s cartoons were really just long commercials for toys. Literally the writers were given the “toy of the week” & told to make an episode around it. Sometimes it would flow naturally (like a winter suite for Batman fighting  Mr. Freeze) but other times it would just be a weird insert (like the TMNT as baseball players). This show was picked up by people who loved the characters & actually wanted to give them development. So if you’ve ever wanted to see animated Teela do more than scream “look out He-Man” then we have a winner! Plus it’s going to be interesting have Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) give us his take on continuing the He-Man story
strong woman song from Southpark playing in the background.
1) Drop Cuties, please. 2) Why did Kevin Smith turn Teela into a lesbian?
This takes me back,  when teachers weren't hooking up with students haha
If only record of Ragnarok was animated this good😔
So Teela is the protagonist and he-man just a side character. Sorry Netflix not gonna eat the Abby thing from the TLOU 2 again.
Looks so good!
is it me or did this trailer focus more on she ra then he man???
The 23rd can't come soon enough
Sword of power is really giving him a shot of Tren.
dont think I ever watched he man but I be watching this
Looks great! But I don't like the way Teela looks like more like a boy. I grew up watching the 2002 series. And Teela was funny and brave. During it.
Heard he-man dies. Not to mention most of the story is about Teela.
ALREADY getting a sjw girl power vibe, i hope i am wrong.
That isnt teela
I already watched the 2002 version on Cartoon Network!! But I never watched the 1980s version it came out before I was born.
Okay, I got some shivers at the end. This actually looks promising.
All I can say is "I have been fooled before"
Who's idea was "THAT" dumb haircut ?
They them and the citizens of a Unisex.
M. O. T. U. is back 💪💪💪💪💪
80s were literally the golden era of cartoons. HeMan, Thundercats, Voltron, Transformers.  Now just waiting on Thundercats project to release and they all will have been recreated!
So the rumors are true, the series is about Teela.....
I hope they pull some story inspiration from the DC comics
Holly shit! I hope they use some kind of rendition of the original theme!!!
This keeps getting better and better. If Kevin Smith…….if you put the original music in this somewhere, anywhere, I’m going to cry. Just amazing. Kudos.
Lol isnt this the one kevins smith is making? Where he-man is just a backround character in his own show and Sonja is gay?
Oh man!! the nostalgia... 🥰🥰
This needs to be an ongoing series, NOW! I seriously loveeeee the art style and can't wait to see this.
He-man and He-ma'am and the Masters of the Universe?
Oh my god they split the swords
Dooooooope
Old one is best, old gold, most of reboot series always smash, movie also. 😈😂😡
I said hey, what's goin' on?
Another reboot pushing the current political agenda
Fist trailer was the best for hype etc why give another one that explain way too much
I feel sorry for the ones who expect this one to be about he-man hahahahaha
Teela: Master of the Universe ft. He-Man
This looks pretty bad. And seems what was leaked long ago is true and it is focused on Teela.   I guess we’ll always have the fond memories of the original show... *sigh*
The real question is will we finally see He-man use his sword to cut or hit someone. Because of old animation “laws” he wasn’t allowed to use his sword in the original animation.
Man animation really hasn't changed much since the 90s
So, you finally came for he-man,  Bait and switch! Why???? Really!! why???
I wish they updated the models a bit. Its kinda weird seeing a half naked blonde surfer dude in a caveman costume fighting a blue skeleton that's wearing clothes that make him look naked.
If they really bench He-Man for Teela... I'm gonna be disappointed.
how does this keep getting cooler
Si claro si ya sabemos que la serie gira en una mujer y no en he man
show
And I say....
Woah 🤯
okay, this speaks directly to the 80s child in me
I 😍 it!!!
This looks rad.
Woke-Man? Or not?
I feel like this sorta confirms a lot of people's worst fears for this series, but I think this looks great and I'm hyped for it!!!
Teela and the Masters of the Universe
Let the youngins have this one...... I'm rockin the 80s version every time.
By the power of greyskull
I'm getting a feeling this centers around Teela and not He-Man.
Finally some good f***n news
The lack of focus on He Man himself worries me. I should have known there was a catch. There always is with Netflix adaptations. He Man NEEDS to be the main character of this show.
GAYYYYY !
wheres orko?
i remmeber this anime from my childhood 1997 i  was watching it at rtl 2 a german canal damn its cool to remake it
Wait so is this a reboot of the original 90 series?
THIS is what He-Man was like and always will be! Not that Cartoon Network shit!
Looks really cool.  Can't wait to see the full thing.
YES
Great another show Netflix will be ruining for everyone
The teaser was better, this trailer shows too much of the plot even if it is out of context. Now the toxic guys will cry again that their beloved half naked nipple flashing man does not get enough screen time and they are forced to look at a woman who is fully dressed and does not pretend to be stupid.
I'm not sure about Skeletor's voice... I'm just used to him sounding all high pitch... but I'm okay with it.
15 years ago.  I saw that cartoon.
This is awesome but the teaser was much more spectaculer; Especially the song choice!
That 'I have the power' sounded so powerless .. the older version used to be so epic!
I’m still not falling for this, still looks cool though.
This is going to suck.
Imma check it out!😁
It looks like Blood of Zeus artstyle, no?
This ga be off the chains
Why all trailers have to be so obnoxious with this bombing sound effect ? It ruins everything...
Now remake The Real Ghostbusters the same way.
Pls bring swat cats also
Klay Travis believes the show is too WOKE
I'll stick with the 2002 version thanks.
Let's go!!
I HAVE THE *POWER*
Feminism
okay so it looks good but the style idk how to put it... its not anime
If I dont get epic skeletor exit....I rebel
0:29 Hey, Stinkor is actually in this. New.
He-Man
Time for everyone along it he woke to belly up to the table for their crow! Amazing looking trailer
I don't like the chick's haircut, or her condescending attitude, but it looks hot.
Hey remember when Kevin Smith said this show was gong to be about He-Man? Then snapped at people that said, " So I hear that this is going to be about Teela and not He-Man, what gives?"  So why is Teela front and center? Screw this man, I'm out, I'm tired of this bait and switch crap. I mean if they had just lead with it being about Teela I would have been cool with it and on board, but nope. At least now they are being honest.
LETS GOOO!
This is seeming more and more that He-Man is taking the backseat of his own story. Not a fan.
Me: Please don’t be a bait and switch Watches trailer: Damn.
When the live action movie?
Looking good so far... I will say though I am a little worried as it seems He-man is sharing the spotlight, some if not most of the trailer was not even focused on him. Hope this does not turn out to be the case for the show.
So this is not about He-Man? The rumors are true. Lame.
animation is shit but overall look nice
"Heyyeyeyeye... Heyyeye...I said hey... What's going on??" -Prince Adam of Eternia
so, it's supposed to be a sequel of the original cartoon ?
Whose smart idea was it to hold the entire existence of a universe into one fuckin planet???
I hope that they don't destoy He-Man with woke bullcrap.
Thunder....Thunder....Thundercats....HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"HE-MAN" brings old memories Pls dub in all Indian regional language
A STRONG WOMYN, SO BRAVE
💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥 CANT WAIT! This was my childhood!
Teela and the masters of the woke-verse.
He-Man
Go Buffy!! You still got it.
Masters of the universe: dark fate
"Still know the tune?"  "AND I SAID HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA"
is he man the main character of his own story here?
I am slightly worried after this trailer that the nay-sayers might be right after all... A very Teela centric Trailer - hope the series puts the focus elsewhere.
I think this shouldve been called Teela.
Not as goosebumpy as the "I need a hero" teaser, but I like the stakes. Was Hordak in there somewhere?
"Still remember the tune?"  "AND I SAY HEYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA"
Fu🤮k Netfli✖️
Please bring visionaries back 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
So the plot of the show that got leaked were true then.
Does HeMan ever explain how they have advanced tech?
We love the first original He Man
The new Teela show looks ok.
Thank God Kevin Smith gets fan service
😎
My Childhood Cartoon now im 40 finally i can be a kid again.
why does prince adam looks like he has aids??
Excellent 🥳🎉🎉
With every trailer I'm getting more and more hyped for this.
I'm in
My childhood is back now 😋♥️
Ai sim, puta merda! Que foda!
Smels like floppy! Even more that all know that He-man will be a side character! NO thanks!
Art looks great. NOOOO Not the split sword story.... what the heck. Gonna start off awesome then handicap itself & story to spew the same messaging we get from everything else.
This doesn't look woke. Therefore I shall watch it.
Who watched it in chutti tv and now waiting for Netflix
Baller.
Wow, just WOW.......... and I thought the 2002 reboot was great. This one just looks like it will completely hit it out of the park. The hype is strong with this one, people.....
I am going to recommend the YouTube channel Spectrecreative the guy who runs the channel used to work in the toy industry and in one of his older videos he explains why the power sword is in two pieces and that might be very important and relative to the story
My Qubo childhood
pretty excited for this regardless of He Man possibly not being the main character. The character design and animation looks sweet!
Pls do a new season of Daybreak 😭
Lol, for some reason when Skeletor says "Behold" I thought for sure, just for a second, he was about to say "Mumm Ra!"
When everyone says your are prince but you can't even wear pants or any dress
Looks great! Genuine question, is it the same studio that does the Dota Animation too? The style is very similar
Now he-man. Tomorrow m. a. s. k?
It really doesn't look like he's holding aloft his magical sword anymore. The last trailer looked like this too. It's kind of his whole thing. "I held ALOFT my magic sword."  Now it's just held by his side. I'm fine with skinny Adam but low sword is sacrilege!
I’ve seen the first five episodes (legally btw) and I can tell you this show is freaking sick!!!
Llegó el BIGOTEEEEEEEE
sth tells me that Thunder Cats is coming
OMFG!!!! 🎉🎉
As long as there isnt any political or PC messages in this i am super excited.
Teela and the Masters of the Universe. No thanks.
I am so old. I remember renting the VHS movies from Blockbuster and buyin the toys from ToysRUS
If he man isn’t the main character I don’t wanna hear it
Mark Hamill as skeletor is a 10/10 choice.
Yes
37 years old... and all the memories come back
Watching day 1...
JUST DO A SPIDER-MAN ANIME
Well, the teaser was much better in my opinion
Was a show of greed by Hasbro has become so much more! I hope this is great!
By grayskull I hope this is good
Looking good. Still blown away by the cast list, so many former DC actors/voice actors along with a few Game of Thrones stars.
SARPADO!! está buenísima la animación!!
I said it once and I'll say it again........  I HAVE THE POWERRRRR!!!!!
Who is that red haired lady... Was she from original or new (i cant remember). Cuz i dont want this to be just some go girl story, i just want to relive childhood
Is this a continuation of the rebooted animated series of a few years ago or are they rebooting MotU yet AGAIN?
It was a bait and switch after all
0:03 The firth planet?  Fourth?  Furthest?  What's she saying?
AWESOME!!! YES YES YES!!!
does it is rated R? i mean i know its he-man but its the same studio that made castlevania, and this look great but he-man is for kids don't see the point in making it like titans.
Bring it on! So ready for this, looks epic
Looking forward to it
I hope its actually actually about he man and not teilla
Que EMOÇÃOOOOOO💜⚔️
I watched Shera with my girls i hope they add humour to he-man like that
Cant wait for this .. Orko looking bad ass finally ..
yeah no, not gonna fall for this one.
F@cking class💗
Not Bad!!
Ok, this looks really good 🔥
Hi
This trailer makes me so sad :'(  My childhood hero is now being used as feminist propaganda. Why couldn't y'all just leave He-Man alone instead of the Bait and Switch tactics?? Ya could have been honest and just called it Teela and the Masters of the Universe. So heartbreaking man
"when are we going to replace the stock placeholder music?  ...  Oh."
WE WILL HAVE THE POWEEEEER!!!!!
Damn the 23rd seems so far away!!
This better fix what happened to She-Ra too...
Let’s gooooo silent Bob!!!
So POWERFULL
It's exiting to watch revamped version of He-Man and Masters of Universe. The show held a special place in my childhood memories. I still kept He-Man and Skeletor collectible/ toy back at my home, purchased in 1992. I hope this version matches the standard of old ones.
Never forget. 2021 Kevin Smith "I watched He-Man ritually from 81 to 82 It always appealed to me" Netflix MOTU closer look  2014 Kevin Smith "I have no love for He-Man either" AMC's Comic Book Men tv show S3EP10 2010 Kevin Smith "I wasn't a He-Man fan" twitter He-Man made its television debut in September 1983
OvO
Why didn't they do She-Ra like this?
Hyped!
Netflix should have contacted anyone affiliated with filmation or dreamworks classic to help in this animation as a an animation and he man fun this is a disappointment to the brand.
Almost Shera 😶
Looks uninteresting, always the same thing. Nothing original
In before whiny incels.
I know there are a bunch of purist nerds out there who are mad about the way this looks, but I never watched to original series and I think it looks sweet. Death of the author.
Other than Castelvenia, normally, Netflix/american's animes turn me off because of their animation. But this looks great.
teela and the masters of the universe.... meh
"I have the power" goosebumps every single time
This looks great. Really hope it doesn’t suck.
The leaks were correct..... I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
Looking forward to the greatest troll of all time, Skeletor. Voiced by none other than the great Mark Hamill himself.
Oh boy Netflix is gonna get a hell of a back lash if this show ends up being a bait and switch
Teela is the hero.... Yeah, pass.
The manliest man, He-Man
Hope it's not just nostalgia bait and it actually has a decent story. Art style is really good.
pelo menos assim param de reclamar daquele outro
This brings out my inner childhood  (dad here)
looks like it's the Teela show after all.
🍆
Let’s gooooooooooooo I’m so hype for this I feel like a kid all over again!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
1. The sword of power being split in two comes straight from the mini comics 2. This definitely does back up rumors that Teela is the protagonist and he man takes a back seat 3. They should have gone with a voice actress instead of Sarah Michelle gellar. 4. We do hear some of gringer’s monologue that Smith said would make us cry
Get in👍💯
Please realise the original too
Love it…..but RUN KEVIN SMITH RUN!!! THEY WILL COME FOR YOU!!! This story trailer didn’t help your  case of a bait and switch….
IIIIIVAN. Necesitamos un trailerazo del Bananero.
I have the 🔋
Well, I'm out.  Yet another woke-ist deconstruction of a cool thing we had as boys, which has to be torn down, so girls can rise up on top.
They keep giving female characters that dumb haircut
Boom
God I'm getting chills
Wait, what’s going on?
Shit, I'm dying, THAT'S SO GORGEOUS, I'M REALLY IMPRESSED!!!!!!!
He man turns evil....get out of here
Trying so desperately to be epic. This basically can only fail.
Looooks Fantastic!!! I love it!
Herooooo😍😍😍
I'm gonna cry this was and is is my childhood before I discovered Spider-Man (yeah i know he older) He-Man was my hero as a child of the 80s We had so much to look up to. And He-Man was one of the Kings
I like how this vibes the old school He-Man.. was worried they were going the rebooted She-Ra route..
We used to watch it during our childhood...  One like for Heman the master of universe
They butchered she Rea
Cant wait for this. Plus the shattered Sword of Power opens the door for some epic sword fights etc. This is going to be epic and its only part 1!
I would love a devil may cry anime next
If it's not in Japanese, I don't care
made my hairs jump up
Please release in Hindi
Amazing!!!
Is the OG series viewing a must for this?
I hope they do a remake for thundercats.
We are Worthy.
MEGA - I'm so looking forward to the new series 💪😎👍
Looks good, let’s hope it’s not filled with woke garbage
oohhhh Yeah!!!!
STINKOR!!!!🦨💚🦨💚🦨💚🦨💚🦨
How come Adam never hit the gym I mean he could go crush a few. He looks like he does not eat.
I just hope they don't pull that voltron bs.
So they're finally doing the storyline from the toys where the sword was split into two? Interesting.
This basically confirms that the rumors we heard are actually true………
Wonderful trailer
Wait is that Emilia Clarke doing the narration?!  Why is there no voice credit for her anywhere I can find?
It's the trailer song for me, I'm watching this just because of that
Holy. *Epic*. Shit.
This looks COOL!!
Skeletor memes coming in, nope theyre not.
Holy shiat 👍
So, is He-Man powerless and stuck as Prince Adam most of the time while Teela leads the way? Is that the vibe here?
Que bueno que no hicieron lo mismo  Con los thondercats
I hope this rekindles people’s love for the Revolution trope
Nostalgia... The childhood days are back.. The movement he say i have the power.. I got goosebumps.....
Please be good, please be good…
Awesome 🙌🔥
Skeletor was our Darkseid back then... 💀💀💀
When's it released?
Dope
Thank you
Looking forward to the insanity. Animation looks REALLY good.
Trundercats is next l hope
I don't know, I prefer the classic one.
I liked
Eeeeeeeu tenho a forçaaaaaaa
Finally Netflix promotes realistic male beauty standards
Idiots, start complaining.

Too bad kevin smith has such a hard on for Teela , He-Man is the star. Other than than animation and story overall looks awesome.
