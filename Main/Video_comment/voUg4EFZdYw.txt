Didn't watch the game but damn that goalkeeper good
Well done jose...take a shower delli lazy alli...go on loan in January so jose can bring in Oliver Skip.
why this match is not listed in playlist ?
Spurs
That goal keeper was on F**** Steroids he needs drug testing after that game! No but honestly he kept them in the game well played 10 shots plus on target Tottenham had. right
Harry Kane comes on and gets another assist too good of a player completely!
Why is Vinicius doing the Mbappe celebration after scoring in an open goal in the europa league against farmers
Lo celso looks 🤤
How can this amazing goalkeeper has been no 2in bloody antewerp?he must be first goalkeeper in mu or barca.
Spurs better hope they win the premier league this season it’s Jose 3rd season next season sooo
The story of a destitute man who started playing football while he was cleaning the skidrow now in the same field as multi-millionaires...a man of dignity and pride well deserved fame and fortune
Is that keeper the same keeper who played for Iran at the 2018 Russia WC
Great Goal Keeper for Antwerp
Brilliant european debut for alireza beiranvand, although he conceded 2 goals, he's someone who just came from a country where the football level is 3rd class, and makes his debut vs a good team like tottenham, his performance was absolutely amazing, hopefully we will see more stuffs like this from him throughout this season, love from iran 🇮🇷❤❤❤❤❤❤
Unpopular prediction: Joe Hart will receive at least 1 more England cap before he retires.
I think tottenham have a very good chance of winning Europa league. Playing well at then moment. Can they keep it up?
BV Iran love!
Special one
Bale freekick amazing,  dafuq!!!
is it me or does mourinho always win 2-0
Coys
That Keeper was their Best Player, Alireza Beyravand if im not wrong, what story he had, fair play to him
I'm a chelsea fan and don't like spurs but KANE has been world class for so many years. He's got to be the most complete striker in premier league 🙌🏻
Bales left foot is a wand
That old magic is coming back, yippee
So glad Hart has been given this chance.
I'm so tired of ppl who have never played the game or can't play on a level would shut up Moura does so much maybe not in goals but winning fouls breaking tackles for counter attacks so underrated but yes would be good to see him score more but he'll get probably 10-15 this year
The Antwerp Goalkeeper certainly rose his stock from this match.   Almost felt sorry for him when Vinicius tapped in......  Almost lol
Tottenham won and answer defence never makes back to stop the second goal. And the goalkeeper need help after he makes a great save.
Play lo Celso in the front 3 with Kane and Son👀
That Freekick was amazing even if it did not go in
The fans probably helped spurs a lot
Well done Beyranvand 👏🏽👏🏽
The work rate of this Tottenham team this season in comparison to previous seasons is unbelievable. Jose have made them into bad guys instead good guys of the past. COYS!!! (Leicester City Fan)
Report vinicius KS and int
is it just me or is the digital aliasing on this video horrendous?
Look at that Spurs had players in the opposition half I never thought I would see that
Mourinho really is a special one
Spurs have basically got two decent PL teams, one of which they use for the Europa League.
I really enjoyed watching their keeper
How did Seck not get a red
Best in the world
Fair play to their keeper he did really really good for them!
Antwerp
I don't think Bale is the player he was, or ever will be again.   I hope I am wrong. The free kick was world class but he doesn't seem the same player in open play.   He just seems to have lost his pace.
That’s a good save from bale free kick give the keeper some frais
I don't get it... seems Kane doesn't care about scoring at all. He's all about the team. It's amazing.
Hi
3:10 - fair play to the keeper. Fixing my broadband on wednesday, facing son, kane and bale on thursday.
Good win
Does Lo Celso not have a right foot or something?
Bale is finished! He hasn’t done anything special and definitely doesn’t look like the same player that once was
Why are Spurs fans going crazy over Bale’s freekick... it literally didn’t go in.
Solid result. Good see fans back in the stadium; and not have to hear that rubbish music when Spurs score. Obviously, hope Tottenham win, but hope Antwerp do well.
Lo Celso is so 1 footed it’s annoying
How on earth did the gk save bales free kick
Bale will have a massive part to play in the second half of the season,Superb man management. Lo Celso #18 is class,Just needs consistency. I wanna see Jack Clarke more!!!!!
Why is Son so Good?!!! Him and Kane destroyed us😫😣
I’m a Spurs supporter for 63 plus years and I’ve never seen the modern football do the things it can do nowadays, it’s like a balloon when the air is let out, bring back the old ball and give the goalie a chance, well our goalie the rest can throw it into the back of the net for all I care cos with hart in goals we may Hugo doesn’t get injured
Beer and Van is a good keeper
Did joe hart actually just keep a clean sheet?
Bale does need to do more, he is on 300,000 week
Maybe play Bale on the left again. So he doesn't always have to  cut in for his favoured and deadly left foot.
Same old Bale, outrageous free kick!  🔥⚽️🔥
I so wish Bale scored that free kick!
They look so fast & powerful !
What a player harrykane
Baleman dan na na na daman dan na na na
Alireza Beiranvand also has the longest f**king throw i've ever seen. It's ridiculous.
I was driving through haringay in north london, and I saw a shop called GAZI ANTWERP !
Let's be honest here! As good as the free-kick was the keeper was at fault for the first goal.
3:01 look at that for a free kick
As it stands we've topped the Europa group and sit momentarily atop the Premier League. The Mourinho project going alright
This score line flatters Antwerp because the amount of shots Spurs had. The Antwerp keeper was sublime on the night What a free kick that was by Bale, so unlucky not to go in
Fun fact: Every English Club topped their European Group Except Man United
A reality check coming up for spurs fans .. The scouser's .. Jose will defo bring his buses out especially at Anfield !!! Nevertheless another Three one tonking from the mighty Liverpool to spurs can only be expected ( LFC 4 years unbeaten at Anfield ) ... Ticket's please for Jose's cowards they park the bus everrrry time but still get Tonked .. How on earth spurs got to a European final with Liverpool god only knows . the wheels on the bus go Jose Jose Jose .. Jose Jose Jose .. Jose Jose Jose . Merry Christmas everyone . Bye Bye.
Let’s all take a moment to pay our respects to that save from the free kick ! 🔥
Vinicius 1-0  3:01 Lo Celso 2-0  4:36
Let’s all take a moment to pay our respects to that save from the free kick ! 🔥
COYS 💪
Bale:     ‘’ I’M BARMAN’’
Lo celso is such a great player
How many asists does Kane have now?
Lo celso best player on the pitch by far!
Jose is a legend. RESPECT
Love to see Rangers get Spurs and dump them out.
someone please humble this vinicius guy why’s he celebrating like he scored a 40 yard screamer like it wasn’t just put on a plate for him by bale
Alireza Beyranvand 🇮🇷💛
Bale is done. I truly hope he doesn’t have his loan extended. He plays no role in this team. Only to sell shirts
That Iranian GK was madly good! Saved so many shots, hope a good club sign him! Wanted to see more Vinicious
Lo Celso had a great game. Hate to see Alli left out but glad Lo Celso’s doing so well
Even PENALDO couldn't Defeat Beyranvand from Penalty Spot At orld Cup 2018 ! 🇮🇷✌😁
L
Top of premier league Top of Europa league Another clean sheet Another assist for Kane Unbelievable
Moura is not passing the ball to Bale....
Hojberg,  ndombele, and le celso in the midfield 👍🏾
“Wasn’t even on target”🤦‍♂️ he was clearly trying to pass to Vinicius😂
Serves them right for having a silly name like Antwerp it's like a cross between an ant and a twerp hahahaha
That free kick was outrageous
Lo Celso hates his right foot
"Just don't catch it right". BT Sport everyone.
Beiranvand doesn’t look 28 at all
Let’s all take a moment to pay our respects to that save from the free kick ! 🔥
We'll have to see how the season progresses.  But I feel the main reason they are on top of the premier League as out of the current top 4 they are the only team in Europa. So they can play a different/weaker team on Thursdays and have an almost fully tested squad for the weekend. Where as the others sides are playing near full squads to get through the Champions League group stages.
How long will bale be finding his form for?
Bale's crazy freekick shows he is slowly getting to his best. Mourinho knows what he's doing. COYS
Imagine being an Arsenal fan that didnt want jose 😂😂
Jose keeps on giving run outs to players who just don't take the opportunity .
Beyranvand was the best player of his team and he is the substitude goalie !!!! He deserves to be a big club's main goalkeeper. I'm sure he got the attentions in this game. Good luck to him
oh look they didnt lose to the among us codes this time
That goal keeper was on F****** Steroids he needs drug testing after that game! No but honestly he kept them in the game well played 10 shots plus on target Tottenham had.
Why are people praising Bale's free kick when he didn't score?!
Gio lo celso our magician 🎩 ✨
I never understand celebrations like that first lads. Bale strikes a screamer and he taps into an empty net. Then he celebrates like Batman after he saves Gotham.
So did the Rangers
Beyranvand deserves a Big Club 👌
SON still can't win over BEYRO 💪🇮🇷
Celebrated like he scored the free kick
Tottenham a good team But there something holding them back.
Fun fact: Man United qualify for the champions league every year just for the work experience school trip, only to be dropped to the Europa league 😂
If no one gets injured, this Tottenham team can go far under Mourinho.
I hope bale can get some goods Goals this season
Harry Kane comes on and gets another assist too good of a player
Only if that bale free kick could of gone in. Goal of the season 😭
Bale is on his way people ..
Beyranvand is World Class  🇮🇷👌
Lo celso played fantastically🔥
Madrid definitely missing Bale
Bale with the free kick🔥🔥🔥
Neuer is Beyranvand of Germany !
People now hate us because we’re doing well. These rivals tears 💉
Bale is out of his prime but still better than most players
About time....
Winks is a cry baby

COYS Europa league Champions 2020/21
