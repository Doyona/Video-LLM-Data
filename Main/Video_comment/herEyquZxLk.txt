Thank you so much I found it
i use them once and i find it by using the storm
Wow
U have AI
Perfect
How do I use them
They changed where the Spiderman web shooters are
My question is why aren't they in the creative menu
Thx
thank you
Dumb over powered items like this are the reason Fortnite is dying
Love this map normally after a few games I memorize the entire map I'm almost level 100 w/out buy levels and I still have 80 percent of map seems new Let's go     Jesus love and will bless you more than you could ask for pray out load(do not feel ashamed or embarrassed) just pray for strang things so he can prove he's blessings you. John 3:16
The Spider Shooters actually spawn randomly at spiderwebs around the map. It really depends on the server on where they are.
Bro thank you
There’s also some under the red bridge
I got the spider arms
thanks dude
Do they spawn in battle lab??
Nice vid
Tysm
Finded one
Do they change spots?
There is normally one at the red bridge nearby shifty shafts
Thanks
98% arent subbed?! holy sheesh
Omg thank you I can never find them and it upsets me I'm so happy that you showed us some spots of where they are thank you so much 🥰🥰
I also think there is one spot under a bridge
thank you soooo much
I new about the forth one in the first landmark but not the other 4 so thx
This was very helpful tysm! 🥰👍🏾
merry christmas 🎄
You can also find them  in areas with spiderman's webs around  to find a backpack with the web shooters
DIDNT find it in solo mode
2:30 the audacity of this guy to call him a bot after missing all his shots and using a pick axe 😂😂 he wasn’t the only bot their mate 🤡
you didnt show the map
When I found every single one around the whole map I just put it at the daily bugle and I saw how many I could get
I saw a Mythic web swingers on Battle Lab at The Daily Bugle
Thank you so much!! This may sound weird but, it has been my dream to sling around with webs because when i see it in PS4 / PS5 spiderman games it looks so cool!!!
A little question. It will be in a permanent location that u showed? because went I went to that spot it was not there
Thx you just got straight to the point! 💜
I get Spiderman
I have Spiderman in Fortnite so that’s why I’m watching your videos the house to find the gloves
I found ultimate
I wonder what's J. Jonah Jameson's reaction when he finds out there's 5 web shooters in the Daily Bugle
Comment bots
Is there anyway to go to the main island in creative mode? I don't play Fortnite, I just want to test this web shooters out
Cool
Just saying it dosnt sound like ur talking and playing it sounds like ur doing a voice over * Im not saying thats bot u playing just that it sounds weird*
Bro was en noob Eif nume bots killed Oh easy elimination i'm so good
Thank you SOOOO MUCH I actually got the web slingers!!! THANK YOU!!! 😊😊😊😊😊
Thx🔥
thanks
Thanks bro you're the best
Thanks! I just wanted to use the shooters, they're fun.
X
I'm always  subscribed to you
Post you helped myself in the older seasons with all the weekly challenges
Ok 1 sec in vid hes like 1rst location im like yessir got to the point
I'm so happy these are in battle lab now, now I can enjoy the web slingers acting like Spider-Man without having sweats absolutely destroy me
Bro I came here to find web stingers not gameplay
Omg another person with this skin. I thought I was the only one XD
Bro, it sounds like you recorded yourself talking after playing the match. Also HOW are you getting bot lobby's, none of them built!
Do you guys think it good that I’m level 49 so far and I still got quest and I didn’t buy and levels and chapter 3 ends march19
Thank you!
I figured it out while I was playing you can find them where ever there are spider webs
Omg thanks
Battle Lab?
Idk why so many search results keep saying that the web shooters are unlimited... That's obviously a lie. We're limited to 80 webs per shooter. We can't even ADD web cartridges from other web shooters to our equipped web shooter... It just throws it back on the ground automatically, so the best we can do is to just switch ours with a web shooter that already has more web ammo.
Yes its a good video but the bags are getting less....😀
Bro I am going in the right spot but it’s not there maybe someone else done and does it go then?
This was actually super helpful man thanks !!!
You can now get in battle lab, I tested it. If you are curious.
No in the orange area on the map I got a pair
It is on a side of a building
You really helped me a lot bro. Thank you!
So are the webs not a permanent thing u can unlock in the battle pass?
Y are ppl bashing him for playing bots? Are people not allowed to play bots? Did he brag about offing players while going through the video? Or is it just unsupervised children holding onto that "I'm better at a video game then you" mentality. Legit question.
Thanks, I've been getting them from eliminations and saving it in my tent
Thanks this really helped
yo
yo \
very helpful
That web shooter needs to be vaulted
Thank you so much
Thanks good vid
Is it available in normal mode or arena?
GREAT GREAT VIDEO! I just used this to find the web shooters and they were exactly where you said they were. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero so getting to swing around was super enjoyable
Thanks you I was looking very where

Thank you sooo muck
Shitty unskippable ads
this "Game" looks so dumb its sad . No wonder the gaming comunity is falling appart and games are trash nowadays.
Wake up, Jesus is coming soon! We are all sinners in need of a savior.  Repent and believe the gospel:  Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.  He is the only way to Heaven.  He alone can save you from your sins and eternal torment in hell!  He loves you and doesn't wish that any should perish.  Time is running out; please believe on Jesus.
Thanks!
Is it in battle lab
Thx man
Spider-Man mythical are fun.   Edit:the more swings you use the longer the reload
Can you get them in playground cuz i cqnt find them
I love how he gets straight to the point.
I love how this guy hype himself up while killing bots in a bot lobby XD Like no way any of those were real players.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Thanks dude you helpt me and others
I uninstalled because I couldn't find em.

Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life1
