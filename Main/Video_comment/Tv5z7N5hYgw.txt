Finish it
I want Charmander and Bulbasaur
No water type just Squirtle
Please its been 4 years im begging you post it or atleast a trailer did you forget about it or is it gonna be cinema please give an update or a sign that your even alive
4 years later and im js now realizing there was an episode 10
Anyyyyy time now
I think there is  a reason that wartortle went super San because his name has war in it
Is the Pokemon god up there arceus ?
(😡+Squirtle)
Still waiting
The series never continued. It's so sad.
What the fu... [dies]
Noooooo I need episode 11 lol. This is amazing pls make episode 11
Am I the only one who feels no sympathy for chimchar? XD
Fun fact: After doing all the math of Charmanders kills, he should’ve evolved into Charmeleon after killing Geodude. And by the end of the story before he’s killed by Squirtle, he would’ve already been level 27!!
they should make a arcanine and make him wise but not that old
It’s official which will come out first ep 11 or gta 6
4 years later and it’s still peak
Still cant believe that its been 4 years
Just sitting here... Waiting for Episode 11... Been 4 years...
WHY HAVENT YOU MADE A PART 11 YET WAHHHHHHH 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
it's been 4 years bro 💔
Hey Shippiddge! If you are reading this, I would like to tell you that I never understood why this episode is all about Squirtle. I mean, I thought this was supposed to be a show about all three starters or Charmanders quest to evolve. If there is a reason behind this, I would like you to describe it the best you can.
(Ep.11)
The next will be peak🗻.
Need more
Decided to revisit my favorite fan-animation in hopeful preparation for episode 11 and I found myself thinking a lot about Charmander and Squirtle's relationship. It's kind of tragic how they couldn't be proper friends because of their shortcomings; in their own ways, each failed to realize in time what was truly important. I feel like if they'd both matured sooner they would've found what they needed in each other; instead Charmander went on an aimless destructive crusade and Squirtle relinquished his free will to avoid facing the reality and the weight of his past actions. I love watching lighthearted projects grow into increasingly ambitious shows of the creator's true artistic potential.
I have a confession to make. I was an avid watcher of Starter Squad back when it was premiering. I'd waited the weeks and months and years between episodes, always satisfied when a new one came out, always patiently waiting for the next, as I was aware animation takes forever and is art. When it'd finally come time for episode 10, even though I'd been waiting for it for a long time, I didn't watch it right away. I was going through some things at the time, so I added it to my watch later and told myself that I'd watch it when I had the time. Truth be told, I didn't want to watch it, because I didn't want it to end. For years those three pokemon grew with me, and I looked forward to seeing the continuation of their little adventures, they even felt something like old friends. I think that on some level, they stand as a sort of symbol of that time in my life, those days I wish I had back, and perhaps like I've been holding onto this video, I've also been holding onto my past. Well, here I am, old friends. I'm ready for the next adventure.
Im not even waiting on episode 11 anymore.  ATP I'm excpecting a whole ass movie for a finale.  PLEASE JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING
All this because Charmander didn’t take turns fighting
It’s been 4 years when will they do another
bro..... keep making these... they are good... don't give up on this, or your dreams, I believe in you!
So no one's gonna talk about "Arooceoosoo"?
Guys this was first a silly cartoon and now it serious
Ima be dead by the time this finishes up 😭🥀
Aqui é o brasil
WHERES EPISODE 11
Ugh 4 years?!
Squirtle is now the chosen, bald, angry and kill gods... kratos looks a lil bit different
This ep sucks the most I already said.  Why Wartortle so insisting to save Chimchar? That dog doesn't have any resemblance to Charmander, he is straightly irredeemable and extremely not likable unlike Charmander.    This episode was out of nowhere and as if abandoning original plot of meeting the floating guy in Cerulean cave.
HEY SHIPPIDDGE! Happy (late) 4 year anniversary to this monstrosity of an episode!😠 (Where is the alternate path anyway?)
Why did he only evolve into Wartortle and not Blastoise?
Its now been 4 years let that sink in moron this is beyond ridiculous people could make this series 10 times over they could make episode 11 faster then you ever will its sad and pathetic that even your own team is quitting bc of how long its taking for 1 episode this series should have been done years ago this series started in 2013 and still isn't done that should say something about how slow you work on stuff even with a huge team the episode still isn't done SMH people would be more understanding if the epsidoe was over a hour long but it's not ita only 30 minutes so its just pure laziness at this point
Oh jeez, it's been a while, huh
Happy 4th birthday episode 10
Broo wheres the new video ive been waiting so longggg
It's said that nothing more has happened in 3 years does Squirtle move on to the next generation I don't know
10 right now 2 left 3 years :/

Nostalgia
3 years no progress lololo
…I know it’s been about 3 years…but…what did Wartortle ask?
I saw a clip of the encounter with Missingno and MewTwo on instagram earlier today and thought this was a recent animation. And now I find out that this series has been around for over 15 years and just binged the whole thing.  I really hope this gets a proper conclusion.
Guys, its confirmed, the guy died in a heart attack. We can't get firther episodes😢
Anyone...2025?
MEWTWO 😮12:51
i’m done waiting i’ve waited for 3 years for nothing if the episode ever does come out i will not support it im tired of waiting for nothing to come out are they actually even working on the 11th episode

How it feels to be high level in mystery dungeons
When you realize that this series started 12 years ago, but Charmander’s final appearance was already 6 years ago.
This is so sad😢
Then the series died r.i.p
The way How squirtle lost all his friends and blames it on him self is so sad..
BRO ITS 2025 WHERE R U!?!?!?!?!?!?
its been 3 years, WHEN IS EPISODE 11 COMING OUT
Just tossing away the whole missingno mewtwo plot line?
Where's parts 11 and 12
Man, It has been three years since the last episode, we need the continuation!

God of Pokemon Wartortle edition
4:32 Is it Mount Everest?
The previous Parts were brilliant. This one.. I dont know.. I miss charmander, balbasaur, Mewtwo and the Pixelpokemon.
My question is what God is he fighting cause there’s a lot of Pokémon gods
The aura when he said something
6:04 ptsd
This dude stinks we never got anything ever again.
vagabundo q nunca contínuo está série
cant believe ive invested in ts since childhood
The abomasnow yelling "WHAT THE Ff-" right before exploding is just so perfect.
When’s the next one. I have been waiting 3 years
I love fearow he is so funny
Abomasnow: "FOOL! Do not attempt to talk to the giant tree! Or suffer the wrath of Ainz Ooal Gown!  Squirtle:Who?  Abomasnow: Sorry, wrong series.
PLS COME BACK 🥺😭
No.
Please do it I’ve waited three years Now I’m eight years old And almost 9 years old please do the next episodes there’s just two more. It’s almost finished, please
Yeah it's true
Deite minha opinião Por que o charmander matou quase um milhão de Pokémons No outro episódio e não evoluiu Antes de ser morto pelo Caterpi Mas o discordescondel Que não fez merda nenhuma Não matou um Pokémon que eu me lembre E evoluir e no final literalmente virou o bens Do mundo Pokémon.
Charmander dying just ruined my already sad day ngl, but I really want to see Wartortle punch god in the face.
I just saw all of this over the past week or so. I love it. I need a conclusion. I hope you are still working on this, you rock
Why is the person that killed charmander still living💔
Anyone here waiting for eps 11

Still waiting for the next ep.
Dude cmon, a *3 year wait and counting* since this episode dropped?
Surprised it took me so long to realize that Wartortle is basically just Asura(like from Asura's Wrath).
I can only imagine this next episode is gonna be a whole dang movie on its own at this point.
Please bring us episode 11 and 12
Don't be Jorge RR martin complete what you started
More than ever i understand the message.
Where is episode 11
bro make a new one pls
Bro I love the long episodes usually tother YouTubers make episodes like 5 minutes but this is just great❤
We need the 12th and 11th episode of starter squad. It better be very detailed because it took more than three years already and you still haven’t completed. It takes about one year to get one episode out. I wanna hear you reply to this and give me a good answer OK
Can you make a episode where Charmander gets revived
Can’t squirtle just use a revive on charmander?
More!
BRO WE STILL WAITING WTF
What do you guys think is coming first? Gta 6 or starter squad episode 11
I have been waiting for 3 years now do you guys think episode 11 will come?
Hey bro is episode 11 still coming, been waiting 3 years now
Crazy to think this came out 3 years ago, felt like it came out just last year.
Where the hell is ep 11 or more. It’s been 3 years, wtf
im 31 turning 32..... the good thing is.. is that pokemon is the shit and im still a fan of pokemon ...  Take your time cuh. pokemon for life..

Still waiting
all i see/hear is Mr. Goldenfold from rick and morty whenever Snover speaks...
Wartortle proceeds to climb the mountain for the next 14 years

Robot
Hey. Flaming robot huh
Flaming robot.  Oh come on I really don't before I'm dead and never go back to the world of Pokémon
Wartortle charmander thanks for everything
Squirtle I'm all alone now  I can't do that
Squirte should be replaced  with piplpup
This episode sucks
CHARMANDAR did so much for squirtle  but he got betrayed
1:18 bro's the discord mod
12:51 i saw mewtwo and missingno.
season 2 premiere
It’s crazy that I never noticed before that mewtwo is at 12:50 and this is just a hunch but I’m guessing he might be fighting the now evolved wartortle
No wonder we can get episode 11 before GTA 7
2025😢
What if he asks them to undo all of the carnage, but missingno shows up and corrupts them.
Still waiting!! Bro please release!!!
Dialga and palkia are on the top of the mountain
Next episode gotta be a few hours long at this rate 😂
COME BACK
where is bro
Where is bro after all these years
name song credits ???
Anyone still waiting for the next episodes :p
Please bring back charmander
If you want to know if you are old they count the amount of years it will take for the episode 11 to come out
When's the next one?
22:30 WHAT THE FU
Hello, anybody around?
Dont leave us for 3 years...
Gta 6 might come before the next episode
1 episode per universal reset
Charmander didn't deserve that ending 😔
Dude 3 years is crazy
If squirtle is now in gen 4 then that means that he tryde with gen 2 and gen 3 end he fell twice
This series is literally the same age as my little brother and I'm pretty sure he'll be able to show his kids this show before it finishes
I think charmander will not came back in ep 11 because it will be ep for bulba🥔
Where are Episode 11 & Episode 12 ? Will we see Blastoise ? Venusaur ? Charizard ?
Still waiting for Episode 11
What will come first gta 6 or a starter squad episode
At 12:51 you see mewtow for a few seconds with that punching monster glitch thing
24:21 this song is cool 😎
Starter squad episode 12 please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
12:34 (I know I could have said it before but let's just say I don't usually think much, even so #Leadercaterpiehater) You know, that's just another irony, because if that were the case, why would you kill your own people just for questioning you in the best way? Huh?
istg ive been waiting for ep 11 to drop for the past 3 years
Who's still waiting for the next episode
lets see i have been watching since 2013,  episode one was in my freshman year managed to finish highschool college and get married all before episode 12..
This show started before I was even old enough to stop wearing diapers and by the time it finishes I’ll be old enough to drink
u alive man?
He is a legend
Why did Squirtle throw that bidoof to the spear pillar😭😭😭😭😭 Edit:Was Chimchar trying to get to Snowpoint city💀
98!? O_O eshae bost a vaof
The Serie isnt Fun like at old times bc After charmander died the Serie didnt make fun and bulbasaur too they to was making the show really good for me
20:04 Notice how Charmender's decapitated head hat suddenly disappeared in this scene
16:07 I don't know why he feeled the urge to pronounce "Arceus" in japanese rather than english.
It's been 3 and a half years this is beyond ridiculous there is no reason this series is taking this damn long HURRY THE HELL UP AND POST ALREADY 🙄🙄
More
should make a comeback fs
11 when?
plis make the next episode but i need a good ending
Bro, it’s been three years free. I’ve been waiting for so long. When’s the next episode gonna come out in like 50 years and the next episode in like 100 years and the next in the last episode like 1000 years
I’m so mad how they just didn’t make episode 11 and 12 they said they would make it in July 2023 and now in 2025 nothing happened
omg turtwig
Its been 3 YEARS chop chop brochacho
I keep on telling myself it has to come out 2023. It has to come out 2024 it has to come out 2025 but it just never comes out part 11 I’m talking about.
Please bro bring back Charmander. What are you doing it
Waiting for the day we see the finish of this
Why did you kill charmander my favourite pokemon
Caterpie is a monster 👿
Imagine what wartortle will be like when he has reached his last stage of evolution
I’ve been waiting for 3 years now for the next episode. WHERE IS IT!?!?!
yo whens the next episode coming
When are the two other one?
Its been 3 years😢 where is ep 12 and 13???
MAKE EPISODE 11!!!
So in this generation, Piplup got picked this time? Is that why Piplup isn't there?
I can imagine Turtwig being voiced by Dreux Ferrano Jr with the same Squirtle voice.
BRO ARE YOU MAKING 11 😭😭
I have a theory, that in episode 11 that Wartortle will get charmander and chimchar resurrected by arceus. Then bulbasaur will evolve, and then they will go back to the leader caterpie and do a similar thing to leader caterpie when geodude attempted to kill charmander. And Chimchar and Charmander would become good friends imo.
POST ALREADY DAMN 🙄🙄
13:32 Nope, it's not loyalty, it's enslaving, subduing with fear (Comparing it to the ima queen of primal mainly by kamau) with fear, traumas, and a little brainwashing (You said it yourself, you used to think that squirtle was afraid of you) you are a hypocrite who in the end only cared about himself and having power, a coward who only knows how to boss around and enslave, I wish whiskers hadn't died or better, he had joined a better team and not been in a manipulative dictatorship like yours, it's good that you lost everything because you deserve it.
Gta 6 before ep 11
It’s been 3 years dang
12:52 can someone tell me what's going on with Mewtwo
I think in 2026 we'll say we got gta6 before episode 11 of starter squad
how much longer to ep 11?
Who does score to lake Moore, charmander or char?
we got the minecraft movie before starter sqaud 11
Ep 11 eles on 2025 june 20
It’s been 3 years bro ONE EPISODE!
Pls bring back charmander 😢
Bruh charmander is peak, without him alive, I ain’t really want to watch this bruh
11 is coming ❤
Such an amazing series. I watched it at least a dozen times by now! So these came out a couple years ago. Any updates on the series? Like there are too many unanswered questions and the starter squad i was supposed to meet up with mewtwo.  Oh please make it where war turtle encounters arceas and after some crazy dialogue and hey epic battle arceas using his god pokemon power reset time to where squirtle Can save charmander! And then do a few more episodes to conclude the whole thing, or they have to defeat the biggest threat yet Because it was formed by chairmander
Pls eps 11 12
22:58 that scene probably was the reason why this took 2 years to come out
Episode 11 PLEASE
are we still gonna get more from this show its been a minute
It's all squrrtels  fault for charmanders death
The way he said SOMETHING
bye bye charmander 😢
People who is watching this in 2025
Add back, Charmander
yo bro, I know it take a long time for you to write and animate a peak story but i think its time to upload ep 11 and 12, or maybe at least an update 🙏
Ill say this again i dont get at all how you have any subscripers let alone 1 miliion that you don't even deserve you olny post once in a blue moon let alone even patreons who are wasting money bc you arent posting anything at all it doesnt take this long to ahimate one episode my friends who animated their season finale lf their series took them 6 months to make not 4 years to make you need to stop being lazy and post already 🙄🙄
Plz episode 11

Not related, but Turtwig was my character in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, so seeing him kinda reminded me of that game
Still no sign of the alternate Path Shippiddge.😠
Upload king
Still waiting...
It’s been 3-4 years. I hope this series wasn’t silently cancelled
Dawg pls js post the last 2 episodes i cant take this anymore😭🙏
where my boy scyther at..
Tertwig the grass type pokemon
Hey I just realized that in one of the flashbacks there’s a quick show of Mewtwo fighting the corruption (don’t blame me I don’t wanna waste time calling something I can’t keep remembering) 12:46
Anyone in 2025?
Please please post episode 10 with charmander
Please please please please please please please bring charmander back as charmelon
Bring charmander back
This was three years ago.
Wtf bro if you don’t want to animate the last episodes at least send me the script bro
The snover are hilarious!
I miss bulbasaur erm
Big Bibby is a W man
Nahh you took yourself too seriously with this one. Back to the roots where we’re shocked by the unexpected instead of these tropes
It’s 2025
remember all this happened because of a single caterpie
Bro it's been 3 years release the final episodes plssse😭
Bro plz make another part with war old
22:01Remastered suggestion: If the choose to deny, You agree to die!
Goofy Run 16:30
Make part 11 already
It's been over 3 years. This is the longest gap between episodes so far.
I don’t get it so where did bulbasaur go?
It’s been so long I rly hope your working on it 🤞
24:20 go get em dude
HEY EVERYBODY! LISTEN TO THESE LEGENDS!
wait what I thought this was 5 months ago 3 yrs?!!
3:58 I know someone else who is [Title Card]
Episode 11 and 12 pls
POST SEASON 3 PLS PLS AM BEGGING YOU
Why is that stupid bug still alive
Theory: the gods up on the top of the mountain will bring chimchar back to life.  Mini theory: there are more bosses then the snow one I think there is for each type
It’s been 3 years bro please
will there be new episodes coming??
I miss when he still made these...
This sucks now like why no bulbasaur and no charmander like have mewtwo bring them back or something like that
Rip Charmander he will be greatly missed even though I’m late by 3 years.
THIS IS EPIC!
I’m gonna be a father of 4 by the time we see episode 12
i remember when this was first posted  i feel old
bro caterpie doesn't even fight she forces her slaves 2 fight
Where episode 11 and 12?
What about episode 11? Is it going to happen?
Theory chimchar evolves at one point and helps warturtle
So diaga and palkia are up there
I'm just praying to god this is all a dream of squirtle and charmander didn't die
im a bird tweet tweet
Where's episode 11? At its been 3 yrs
this thing started when I didnt know how to read, now I'm going to college and I probably wont see a finale before I graduate... man I love this so much
Bro said wtf😂😂😂
When’s the next dam episode?
Who in 2025?
What happened to piplup? Why wasn't piplup in episode 10 with squirtle and the other 2 sinnoh starters
Prediction: Charmander comes back as a Haunter or Gengar  We see him become a Gastly, so it’d make sense for him to come back in a new form like that, while still retaining the consequences of his death
what if sandslash had helped them
CONTINUE THIS PLEASE
Bassicly 4 years bro what the heck bro
bro why😒
Bro it’s been 4 years 😭 when we getting the next episode
i guess squirtle is like kratos now
Its no longer starter squad 😢😢😢
tbh i really hate squirtle with every cell in my body
Shippiddge please tell us if he’s going to ask to bring charmander back please tell us please 24:17
Shippiddge, I have cancer. it's pretty bad. doctors say I have  3 months to live. my only wish is to see episode 11 of starter squad. please finish it.
does the 11 episode done I'm it's 2025 dude
Instead of gta6 meme, it should be "before Starter Squad Finale"
Hell naw we gonna get gta6 before starter squad finale🙏
When’s the next one
yo what is taking so long😭
Who else is in 2025 and waiting for the next part?
BRO MAKE THE 11 EPISODE MAN COME PLEASE
When is the next episode
bro when is the next episode coming out
Pls tell me we rewind time to bring them back
Really hope the story turns back to the missingno stuff with mewtwo
What if ?squirdel then  wasn’t happy about  them killing charamander so then he killed all the catarpes
Will there be an Ep. 11?
3 years, 3 years, that's longer than the episode 9-10 wait... It better be amazing-  Lmao
No I want charmander
Not gonna lie Squirtle would do anything to avenge Charmander honestly, if he betrayed that little worm out be happy because normally my second favourite Pokémon is normally Charmander and Charizard, but nobody cares about Charmeleon right?
I forgot about this series. Just remembered. 😅
Where's the alternate path Shippidge?
🖕 to this episode😡
Shippiddge still won't just say a word Probably because he is a turd So let's get this over really quick This episode can suck my d-
To be honest I like these vids but I have been waiting and I'm now saying this because the short video that seid two left when like not be rude but if ur like idk hurt badly injured idk but I want to see the last to take your time don't rush
When the 11 come out
Its almost 4 years where is the episode 11?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean when this series started i was 4 and now im 15!!!
3 years and no 11 and 12
Done yet
BRO PLEASE GIVE US EPISODES 11 AND 12 WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 3 YEARS
9:09 i think we all hoped that he thought that squrtle was talking about charmander and not chimchar
We need more!!!!!!
22:20 he evolved
come back grandpa
No way it's already been 3 years since the last episode. I can't see what you're cooking with last two episodes
someday episode 11 will come
BRO ITS BEEN THREE YEARS IT BETTER BE THE GREATEST THING IVE EVER WITNESSED I’D RATHER WAIT ANOTHER ELEVEN YEARS FOR GTA 6 (because gta 5 is peak gaming NO DISCUSSION)
Not charmander
Snowver being snover: 10:27 “friends don’t care if your their enemy. some of my closest friends are my greatest enemies and I NEVER EVEM TALK TO THEM” “wut” 11:53 “together we will find chumpdar and make everything right again because of friendship reasons” 13:47 “Are you having a flashback? Oh boy i can’t remember the last time I had a flashback. It must have been about 3 years ago *goes into a flashback*” 14:29 “cold people are no match against HOT people” 9:49+15:03 “there’s snow in the way” 23:51 “WOAH and now he’s holding onto him for some reason. THEEEE END”
Did shippidge die?
Been watching the series since I was 4-5 bruh
The Caterpie Leader got what she deserved because she killed Charmander
I love Charmander And Squirtle’s Relationship Because they act like brothers
I hope Bulbasaur Returns because if they don’t I’m gonna be so mad
I’ve been watching this series since I was 5 now I’m 16
19:18 the subtitles say "every" instead of "ever"
3 years still waiting for episode 11
wheresss the 11th episode???
I forgot how peak this was.
"This... IS FOR PABLO!!!!" "Wait wait WAIT WAIT WAIT-"
Hell we're are going to die of old age before this damn series is ever finished I wish I never found this series in the first place if I would have known how fucking slow you were going to take with every episode 🙄🙄
3 YEARS TO MAKE AN EPISODE
It’s been 3 years I’m still waiting
In the next episode can you make bulbasaur and charmander return or I know charmander is dead well can you make him and bulbasaur return in episode 11 please.
Charmander kill caterpies for survival but chimchar is an Asshole to the bidoofs
3 years wow
New movies at the movie theater  take faster to make than these episodes
We’re tf is 11
how the hell was this 3 years ago i vividly remember seeing this on my recommended
Bruh where’s ep 11 it’s been 3 years
wow it really has been three years
Hey wait where is Bulbasaur 🌺 in all this that is my one question ? To ask
Hey Shippiddge! If you happen to be reading this by any chance, I would like to remind you that I DID NOT like the direction you went with this episode I'm commenting on. If you've forgotten what I mean, I'll remind you.  1- The scene revealing that Charmander is dead came across as disappointing and angering to me. This is because that meant Charmander ended up getting killed off, despite ALL his determination, efforts and hardships up until that point. 2- The third flashback reveals that the Caterpie leader finally realized they were doing wrong, so they set Squirtle free to atone for their crimes and then went into hiding. I thought that was DUMB, because I believe it was DESERVED to see that bastard DIE after everything they did.😠 3- Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at the end of this episode, which I thought was STUPID. because Charmander was determined to evolve, yet YOU LE HIM DIE BEFORE HE EVEN COULD, YOU STUPID MORON!😡 4- The inclusion of generation 4 Pokemon was just random and unnecessary, because I thought you were only going to use generation 1 Pokemon in the series. (Since the series is supposed to be a "parody" of the original "Red and Blue" games, I believe the reason behind that might have something to do with the time skip.) 5- Chimchar dies and Turtwig abandons Squirtle in the episode they debut in. Just WHY ARE YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE NEW CHARACTERS IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET RID OF THEM AFTER WE JUST MET THEM!?😠 6- A line from Squirtle states that Bulbasaur was the ONLY member of the original cast to get a happy ending, since he decided to stay behind for no apparent reason whatsoever. Which is JUST UNFAIR!😡 7- Just to let this cat out of the bag. The time skip was just unnecessary. Because that means THEY DIDN'T/COULDN'T MEET THAT FLOATING GUY IN CERULEAN CAVE LIKE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO!😡 8- The previous point also leads into THESE following questions- - Has the floating guy been waiting in the cave for 10 years? - A "blink and you'll miss it" moment in this episode shows that the floating guy is STILL fighting that random eldritch monstrosity. So is the floating guy the only one fighting the eldritch monstrosity now? - Is the floating guy STILL fighting the eldritch monstrosity after those 10 years or had it been destroyed/defeated at some point? - How many Pokemon has the eldritch monstrosity absorbed during those 10 years? - Is the floating guy even still ABLE to hold off the eldritch monstrosity after those 10 years?  Why did you make the show go THIS direction? Why couldn't you just have them save Squirtle, kill that caterpillar bastard and head over to the cave? (Like I wanted.) If there is a reason behind this, I would like you to tell me what it is. (If you're reading this that is.)  P.S.🖕to this episode and where is the alternate path I wanted? (There's STILL no sign of it!😡)
Been 3 years already huh
Bro when will the next ep come out!!!
Why does it have to end like this!!!? TELL ME WHY!!!
12:48
I love this show please come out with new episodes please and thank you.

Wens part 11
Bro revive charmander ive been waiting for the next episode my whole life
You need to post he next episode already this is beyond ridiculous its now onto year 4 and thr next episode still isn't out dont be a jerk and leave the series to end off like this especially when you promised us the next episode was coming when its not
Make 11
1:21 blaza in shocks for 1 will be very sad or very mad
please make episode 11 where chamnder is one of the pokimon gods
Can't wait for episode 11!
Next time we see squirtle(wartortle) he might be blastoise considering he's at level 99, but damn did he look completely burned out
Does Squirtle have ultra instinct .
22:58 😂
Yo does anyone know what the song at 24:21 is?
rewatching this again, i never get tired of how good the writing is
Didn’t squritle said you took so many life’s and then killed Lenoard
Please tell me I'm not the only one who's god of war vibes at the end
12:51   Mewtoo!
has it really been that long? 2021?  its been 3 years when is the next episode bro Edit: when ep 9 came out it took 2 and a half years to make episode 10 and its been 3 years ever since ep 10 so that would mean episode 11 is probably in a month or two
He’s not making a new episode
Whats the music in the end? (Not in the credits)
It’s 2025 now can we have episode 11?
bros kratos
Mewtwo  hitmonchamp and haunter vs missingo!
3 years :(
I noticed Squritle has an Everstone as a necklace
the tree sound like fuking asian
My question is, what happened to Cerulean Cave, the thing Mewtwo talked about? Like ok we saw a Snow God and thats it, i don't get it?
He's going to take the 10 years later legit
I think Wartortle is going to ask the Pokémon Gods to bring Charmander back to life
2025
THIS CAME OUT 3 YEARS AGO 😭
What I grew up with: What my kids will also grow up with:
Bro guys, I don’t think that they’re gonna make starter squad episode 11 this year because if they were then the trailer or the teaser would’ve been out by now yeah I don’t know if it’s coming out this year I hope I hope it does
When you releasing the next one
I know it's not the cool thing to say since everyone seems to be okay with it, but charmander's death killed this series too, or at least my interest.
We still waiting
22:57  Me: meteor shell impact
0:42 these videos are fake since bidoofs will demolish the chimchar in seconds
If Wartortle can easily defeat Abomasnow, I’d really like to see what Blastoise can do to those gods.
2025 and there is no episode 11 ahhh that will be for the next year i guess
For crying out loud, this was 3 years ago!?
People who still waiting for EP 11👇
well we all know charmander finna make a return and become charizard to inevitably face off against missingno.
Can we get episode 11 now
There’s no piplup
It feels like yesterday I saw this online and freaked out, I am really suprised it’s been 3 years since this released
Make ep011 and tomorrow is ep1-ep11
Make ep011
When is the next episode coming I've been waiting for 3 years now
Wow already been 3 yrs
When the episode 11 will be out?
Did anyone see mew tew fighting corrupted pokemon?
i almost cried when charmander died last episode  WHEN IS EPISODE 11 ITS BEEN TWO YEARS
I remeber when this came out  i was wondering has ep 10 of starter squad come out i checked and it as uploaded less than 20 mins ago lol its been 3 years its 2025 jan Tuesday 7th i hope ep 11 comes out this year
The episodes had like a 1 year gap between them it’s been 3😢
It been 3years  bro and late happy new year
Bro *my* Charmander got traumatized for life D: 7:58
And yet, we'll never find out what was at the top of that mountain....
Mewtwo lore coming back in ep 11????
I hate this. Give me my Charmander back. 😔
It's been a year now damn 😂😂😂
Caterpie did this to themselves, they deserve that fate. So I don't really feel bad for the fact that they ruined everything for him and his friends.
Where is part 11?
Squirtle warned Leader Caterpie of this. Killing Charmander was only going to morph it and their army into monsters. Theres nothing left to Leader Caterpie's name and the one person who tried to warn them has Shell Shock beyond belief.
Not gonna lie I still miss charmander he will have a special place in my heart
2025 and still no new video
where's 11 and 12
People here in 2025  ⬇️
❤
3 years, please.... give me the next part, I started when I was 18, I'm almost 30
january first 2025 im still waiting for part 11 bro...
Ive been waiting for the last episode for 3 years now ive litterly hit puberty
BRING CHARMANDER BACK
Squirtle involved in what the heck is Bulbasaur? No he’s back at the Cape but the Cave is on fire during the battle is he dead
BRING Charmander back ASAP
10:09  Squirtle associating Chimchar with Charmander and fully believing he's the same way out of grief hurts me every time 😭
Todos confiamos en sacas el ep 11 el próximo año
damn 3 YEARS!!!! AND STILL NO ep 11 what happened to this guy
Its been 3 years man come on wheres 11
Yo Nidoqueen vs Blastoise sounds dope
Turtwig spittin' facts
I just saw the didgimon in the squad supporters area after rewatching
Charmander had it coming, poor squirtle though, he just wanted to try and help, every step of the way
Please make arceus or mewtwo revive charmander
I think that he is going to dring back crdmander
We need episode 11
I think you should make a season dedicated to the caterpie war
Mr. Shippiddge, please remember us fans and at least release a trailer for the next episode...  It's been over 3 full years
Im commmented in over 3 yrs plz upload now
The show never did finish as the nukes of Russia and America east and west open fired on each other the fires of hell consumed most American cities anything surviving got flooded with radiation craters the size of counties
22:18 the best coolest Dragon ball z part
This is Charmander vs. Caterpie as with Chimchar vs. The Bidoofs.
When is episode 11 coming out?
squirtle starts to look more and more like charmender, btw starter squad best series ever
why did you stop making videos
For charmander chsrggggggggggg
Why did they kill Charmander Squirtle? Should I help Charmainer you should’ve beat the crap I have those then
When there is going to be a new episodeee :((((
Y’all we need Charmander to start his villain arc or revnge the fact he got literally betrayed by Squirtle and that sand dude who just evolved we need a new series of where he needs to get revenge
wasnt the next bullshit meant to come out at the beginning of last year. This wont end until 2030 at this rate
23:37 Squirtle got mad at charmander for “trying to evolve” Squirtle told dead chimchar that he would’ve gotten them hell if he evolved. Same type. Same starter. Same series
we need more of these. I loved these.
Charmander: now the caterpies are wearing my head
When is episode 11 coming out?
Nah bro we are going be like 40 when episode 11 comes out
WE NEED PART11!!!!!!
Its about to be 2025 WHEN IS EPISODE 11 GONNA COME OUT
I really want a dog
New episode???
This was NOT, 3 YEARS AGO!
This is the extended pokemon edition version of the eggman parody where he goes, “I miss my wife tails… I miss her a lot.” But instead it’s, “I miss my friend Char, I miss him a lot.”
Dude i wish Charmander comes back, we already know Bulbasaur is and i really am happy. But i feel like without Charmander its just not it. Every group needs to have the Dumb one,Smart one and the Angry one. Imagine just Charmander coming back to life and having a fight  Caterpie and won🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I watched this when ep 9 was newest
When epesode 11 I’ve watched this for years all the way since before epesode 10 and it’s been 3 years since this epesode
Nope I’m not watching it’s not good without charmander
I want charmander back😔
That’s me!
What happened next I have got to know is squirtle is going to win ?
3 years ago
Make another one
I hate you. I hate you… bring him back. Bring him back…
Crazy how this video came out 3 years ago and we still haven't gotten episode 11
We’re still waiting for part 11
Still waiting for episode 11 in 2024
GOD DAMMIT 3 YEARS WHERE'S MY DAMNED PART 12
Charmander comes back as a gengar real
What about season 2?
Quem é você não vai ter o sinal e pesquisar capítulo 1 a caixa todos e conte tão triste sem chave chave mas vai curtir sai de falta porque vai ter 11 isso 11 once é maior então vai colocar capítulo 11 ou não vai capítulo 11 não confirme onde é pão tá
super good jod  make more  pokemon  story 11  goodbye
Should make more these are funny
Are u actually making episode 11?
24:17 what he means by something he means to bring everyone who died back including charmander
WH- HUH, HOW?! YOU CANT TELL ME ITS BEEN 3 YEARS, WHYD I THINK ITS BEEN ONE
When new ep?😢
I've always thought Squirtle's eyes are unnaturally red... they were PTSD eyes.
How does caterpillar go from constantly losing and just coming back with more weird plans to fucking hitler
Its already has been 3 YEARS!?
3 years already???
🗿
Where's Piplup?
bring Charmander back
6:14 BLUEY REFERENCE?
3 years. Wowzers
episode 12 is coming 2047
“Something” that lime is probably one of the coldest line ever
Probably in episode 12 wortortle will evolve to blastoice
Going back to this series is wild 10 years ago I watched this stuff
what is the song that plays when wartortle is climbing up the mountain with ded chimchar in tow?
Can you make chapter 11 and squirdle seed another charmander
squirtle's biggest gain upon his evolution is his eyebrows.
abomasnow moveset: (gen1-4 moves) -wood hammer -sheer cold -giga impact -avalanche
"Truly our friends are the most replaceable people we know." XD, and with modern culture being what it is, might actually hold a grain of truth.
Hold up, wait a second, did I hear closely from EP 7, a meme for Caterpie leader, you can tell in the beginning of EP 10,😅  0:08
13:56 poor snover had a flashback and slowly fell behind
3 years later and still no 11th startersquad episode in sight ...
Pleaseee....los episodios que quedan? La terminarás algún día ?
13:43 bro is he good? He looks lifeless
What if the top has legendary pokemon and while wartotle fights all of them he evovles into blastoise destroys all of them and he becomes the next God to save charmander he goes to the pokemon tower to find his missing soul he finds him and revives him and Charmander evovles to be a god too
When episode 11 will exit i ll be an old grandpa
Is there ver gonna be a final to this?
Fearow: *bragging about being a bird*  Squirtle: *certainly murders Fearow*
We boutta get GTA6 before ep-11
every fire type is hot headed
FORESHADOWING   6:57 "Everything I've ever done- EVERYTHING! It was always for- it was... no... no."  21:48 Squirtle finishes up the statement he made earlier. "Everything I've ever done was for someone else. But you can't escape the wrong decision by putting it on others. If I'm gonna make bad choices, they're gonna be my own!"
3 years? really?
"hOaah, bird" -Fearow, ????-2021
21:26
Man bro please don't make us wait for more years
Just was two years ago when is episode 11 coming out or 12 when just when
Squirtle’s going full-on Kratos mode now.🔥🔥
I think ima have to take manners into my own hands and just finish the series myself
U are you evl sckdll
Maybe the gods of the mountain is Charizard 😅 or is Charmander from the starter who evolved because he fake his death  I switching to another Charmander
Bro I love charmander and chinchar!
Aaaaaaaaaaa🐢🐢🐒🦫🌲🌲🌲❄️
🦫🦫🦫🦫🦫🐒🔥
Bad ending, charmender shouldn't have died
Do itt!!!!!!
I wonder if this series was dropped
It’s officially been 3 years, still no episode😢, hope the next one was worth the wait
I can’t believe this started 11 years ago and its still going on. I think i tuned in at ep 5
So is the main caterpillar dead or alive?
Heres  how i think charmander will come back  Mewtwo: Turtle Wheres That Lizard i still Have Unfinish bussiness with him  Squirtle: u-uh will hes dead?  Mewtwo: Dead!? That Damn Lizard dare to Die with Unfinished bussiness unacceptable!   *casually revives him back*
I was thought this episode released last year it's been 3 years
My Dumbass Watching this series since 2014
can’t believe this is already three years old… feels like it was released just last year
I didn’t know it was three year anniversary i just wanted to see if there was an update.
ITS NOW BEEN 3 YEARS AND EPISODE 11 STILL HASNT FUCKING POSTED THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS HURRY THE HELL UP AND POST THE NEXT EPISODE ALREADY THERE IS NO DAMN REASON WHY ITS TAKING 3 YEARS FOR ONE DAMN EPISODE THERES REALLY NOT this is a new recrod for how long 1 fricking episode takes 🙄🙄
Hey Shippiddge! Happy 3 year anniversary to this festering blister of an episode.😡 I hope you know/realize why I'm calling it that. (SERIOUSLY, why can't you just give me the alternate path I wanted from you?)
I hope we get more of these videos soon.
This was ,  two years ago and still no ep 11 I, so sad.
Hi, can I purchase works in the style of your Pokemon videos for a movie I'm making for my child?  I would appreciate your consideration, thank you...
Not long after, miles above ground level, Wartortle fell ill due to the high altitude of the mountain, slipped and fell back onto the sharp rocks feet below. Bleeding to death, he saw Charmander’s ghost along with Chimchar’s. “Come, come home with us” they said with a smile.. And Wartortle died.. THE END. Closure for anyone who’s fed up of waiting for episode 11.
When's the next episode
this gives me god of war vibes
So are we going to see what happens to whiskers in ep 11
Fun fact: this was made on my 8th birthday
When is charmander coming back?? Or when is new episodes coming out
When is the next one 😢
I give up i think we are never going to watch episode 11
BRING BACK CHARMANDER
level 98 Squirtle
charmander will come back
When is next episode
I hate leader caterpie that character killed charmander she just killed the entire series
You have 40 people on your team but yet it takes you 2 plus years to post a damn episode 🙄🙄
From what I could gather/understand, you will not be making that alternate path idea that I wanted. I only gave it to you because this very episode I'm commenting on offended me very severely, so the alternate path was to make up for it. (You got what you wanted, now it's my turn.) I fail to understand why you denied giving me the alternate path.
Where's Piplup?
🖕to this very episode! (I hope you know why I'm saying this Shippiddge!😡)
Hey Shippiddge! If you are reading this, I would like to let you know that this very episode that I'm commenting on has become the BANE of my existance. (I sure do hope you understand what I mean by that.)
Squirtle is Anakin Skywalker. Both tricked by a figure that took inierest in them in order to save someone they cared about only to end up that figure's emotionless gun.
Fearow went insane 6:07
13:02....oh? 13:20....OH....
Why would u make squirtle the main character it should have been squirtle who died because he saved Charmander then time skip then Charmander who evolves and then kills the snow
I HATE SQUIRTLE HES THE REASON CHARMANDER IS DEAD
Can you get back to life Bring him back to life bring him back
Fishing We have metal pokemon with fire times And that is Amanda
Let them help you then I see you die   Don't kill youIf you know If you know you die So then help you😢😢😢
Please more 🙏 even if it take another 3 years please 🙏
Ive been waiting for so long wheres 11?
This got so dark 😂
after rewatching this episode I saw that the caterpie wearing a cap isn’t a normal hat it was charmanders head…
By far the worse one no chamander no bulbursar hate the way the story turned then they just threw new characters in story got wack. Chamander did all that to find him.
Charmander
Beaver Society
If Wartortle was this strong, i wonder how Blastoise would be…?
Charmander is alive. Yay.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love 💕 Pokémon
Where is episode 10 and 11 Iv been waiting for 3 years
6:12
22:52
When squirtle evolved, he completely destroyed snoway, and If charmender was alive and he evolved as well imagine wat he could do to snoway😮  (It's a shame that chamamder died though he was my fav character in this series)
The credits are so damn on fire. Amazing!
Bro it been 2 years he not make another one
Wait what about episodes 11-12
Ok chimchar is literally luffy dub though right?
He is a level 100 Wartortle. Tremble in fear
When in the ep 11 coming
22:33 This plays in my head on repeat for some reason
make another part of the seiries! its cool :)
Pls pls make a return for charmender we want him to evolve pls bring him back cmon man charmander is the main character all of us want him back to evolve we thought he would evolve pls bring him back
I'm the son of account btw
I've loved this series, and I've just returned to it if my suggestion came in episode 11 or other episodes. I would love to see Charmander come back to life. If this happens I will be very happy and have some information I'm 9 years old and only 15 days until I'm 10 and my birthday is October 3rd
How much you gonna make us wait?
I really feel it's a pity that a character with a distinctive personality died so quickly.
Where is the 11th one
So what about with the glitching thing? aren't that the main problems?😭
Still bad ass.
So, Charmander developed as a person, learned how important Squirtle was to him, then when Charmander went in to save him, Squirtle beat him then stood there as caterpie killed him. ...Sure Charmander was an ass but wow...I don't think he deserved that.
How you animate this ?
For those wondering episode 11 will probably be getting a 2026 release episode 12 might be 2029 or 2030 That’s just pure speculation though
Man, i can't wait to wait till 2030 for episode 12
Please please allow Charmander to somehow come back please I beg of you. I want to see him back. It is what I demand please I beg you.
why didnt u continue this its so good
22:59 WHAT THE FU- *gets nuked*
Still waiting for ep 11.
Pls i will charmander reviven
RIP charmander (comoletetly forgor about this show but its still amazing)
I was starting high-school when this came out and I think I'm probably going to graduate before I see the last episode.
One question tho, where is pilup?
Who’s watching this in 2024😮
Hace el nuevo episodio pls
2:56-2:57-2:58-2:59-3:00
20:02 bro that snow guy can’t walk why he acting like he can’t just climb and go around him lol
Now it’s been 10 million years
When will the next episode release
Episode 1: That's a lie, he only knows scratch. Episode 10: If you had evolved, you'd be giving them hell.
These trees 😆 🤣 😂
He’ll show us truly why he is called *wartortle*
Did Charmander have to die 😭
It’s been 2 years 😞
Where is episode 11😞
The scream by squirtle in the start of the video reminds us all of a funny scene from ep 4
How did a blue turtle that squirts water get to sinnoh if the last time we saw it,it was in kanto.😊😅
BRB, I’m going to go catch a Snowver!!! I don’t want to hurt his little tree feelings.
Male 11th episode
this is taking too long 😢😢😢😢
Can't believe this episode is almost 3 years old.
24:19 ok why is this unironically badass
I pray charmander and bulbasaur come back 🙏
Why are all the fire starters assholes?
What I Think Is Going To Happen In Episode 11 So It Will Start like this at the end of episode 10 Sqwirtel: Something that is orange reptiln  and flaming hot!.Who Apears To Be!...... CHARZARD. What I Also Think Is Going TO Happen In Episode 11 Sqwirtle Is Going To go back in time and rescue Charmander and get the heck out of here and then.... 50 years Later The Starter Squad Has Evolved Charmander To Charizard Sqwirtle is either going to be blastoise or the blastoise with the third gun on its back Idk But Finally Bulbasaur To VENASAUR. What I think is going to happen at the end Black screen and then some lighting bults that are shaped like pikachu. Well what do you guys think is it awesome or awful?
Im still mad at squirtle and wish he died instead of charmander
What happened next ……..
Where is 11-20..... you cant leave us on a cliff hanger like that....
Where is episode 11 and 12
Please make more!!!!! I beg you, please!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's been two years... I wonder when the new episode is gonna come out
Tbh I kinda didn’t like it after coming back after like 5 years waiting for this to release I kinda wanted like charmander to still be alive but it’s wtv not the ending I wanted but it’s better then nth
GUYS HOWS HERE IN 2024 AND ALSO DID YALL NOW THE PIGHIN THATS FLYING WITH A HELMET AT 12:11 WAS A YOUTUBER NOT FOR LIKS ANEWAS BYE Z;0
Ep 11 ?? 😔😔
can someone tell me where do i find the soundtrack at the end where squirtle climbs the mountain carrying chimchar? 24:19
O que aconteceria se ele remontasse o charmander e depois usasse um max revive nele?
I saw Mewtwo 12:51
What the hell i just realized its cuzthe trainer picked blue shell guy instead of flamethrower
The starter squad ark will continue to become more interesting 🤔  And shippge or sorry for mispronouncing it* Don't take this the wrong way but.. I think Nidorino has a crush on Charmander tbh
''If I'm gonna make bad choices, it's gonna be my own'' hits hard af
For anyone curious, the Caterpie wrote "Victory" on Charmander's head.
W years to make 1 ep chop chop boy work faster
Hu I just realised we probably aren’t going see mewtwo because the 🥗🦖 (can’t spell so just using emojis) is gone and the 🔥🦎 is well 🪦 and the 💧🐢 doesn’t know about mewtwo
better than 99% of the pokemon anime
Please make part 11
23:17 Ok, hot take, like , EXTREMELY hot take, but Squirtle, I can think of MANY situations where that train of logic might not fly. Like, what if someone is being threatened with the loss of their life? Or the life of a loved one? Or all of their friends and family? Or what if the person who's telling them to do something is stronger than them? What can they do? Fight back? The controller is stronger than them, so they'd just get beaten to a pulp, or worse, killed! Heck, since Snow is an "emmesarey of the gods," it's plausible that the latter situation is his situation. You say he always had a choice, but if the supposed god really is an omnipotent being, or simply just a miriad of times stronger than him, then he would have chosen death, as the "god" would probably just kill him, and then do all of the killing they wanted Snow to do themself, or just pawn it off to some other victim who isn't strong enough to fight back. I get that it ties into Squirtle's arc about taking accountability for his actions, but there was an opportunity for him to fight back against Caterpie. He could've blasted them with water the way he did to Charmander to stop them from killing him. And then he could've freed Bulbasaur and together the 3 of them could've fought to escape the Caterpie's hideout. Meanwhile with Snow, I HEAVILY doubt he could've done ANYTHING to the supposed God which very well COULD BE a god considering that Arceus exists in Pokémon. So comparing his situation to Squirtle's feels a tad victim blamey.
What Happened to Piplup
Make new episodes of This.
I’ve been waiting 2 years for part 11
0:45 Aquí podemos ver un chango ígneo peleando contra dioses
21:54 are we all going to ignore the reference to episode 8 when charmander threw a rock at haunter when he was a monster that ate him?
This ep came out before 1st ep of murder dromes, is ep 11 came before last murder drones ep or after
2 to 3 years later and this is still amazing
Finally episode please
I have a theory hear me out Char is ash’s rival Paul’s Chimchar and in this universe Ash never found him
Are you going to make more episodes of Pokémon?🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
i love this series i just came back to it... after 3 or 4 years, and i cannot wait for anoter part.. keep doing the amazing work
Why did Caterpie say she feels bad for (pity’s) whoever gets squirrel next? What did he do?
when is episode 11 coming out
24:14 This is probably the best line in the series and it’s funny cuz it’s also the last line of the series   edit: the first time I did the line wrong so this is me fixing it 😑
I want to see a shiny in this series
I WATCHED THIS WHOLE SERIES 13 TIMES, WHEN THE HELL IS EPISODE 11 GOING TO COME OUTTTTTTTT IM  LITERALLY 18, ITS BEEN 10 YEARS AND IM STILL INTERESTED IN A FAN ANIMATION OF LITTLE MONSTER GUYS CALLED POKEMON Also charmander deserved better he did all that to save squirtle and died…..
Where ep 11 at
Wait, Squirtle and Wartortle get voiced by THE SAME GUY?!
20:08 oh caterpie lost his charmander hat where could i be?
wortortle will probably ask for chimchar and/or charmander to be revived or be sent to the beginning of episode 1 and prevent everything from happening
im typing this in 2024 and when is the next episode is going to come out? its been 2 years and epidsodes 1-9 were amazing but when chandmender died it dosent feel the same good fun show from 2014 it just ruin everything 😥
22:50 WHAT THE FU-
Why charmender die is mc
just rewatching this, need to rejigger my memory for when the next episode comes out
bring back my nigga charmander
when does episode 11 come out bro
“So, what are you gonna ask?” *S O M E T H I N G^
bro its been taking so long for you to upload im all grown up now
Bulbasaur got a happy death? I'm sorry, Squirtle, but being eaten alive doesn't sound that happy. Bulbasaur got the truly terrible death. Charmander at least made the choice to be a warrior and he went out a warrior's death because of it. Bulbasaur made no such choice. Not to mention, Charmander went out quick, Bulbasaur went out slowly. Bite by bite. A quick death is preferable to a prolonged one.  Edit: I almost forgot. Excellent job! Keep up the good work! Finding things like this takes a bit of the sting out of the falling writing quality in movies recently.  Youtube. A millionth the budget, a million times the passion.
pls 11episode
To everyone hoping charmander comes back, he’s turned into ghastly. When haunter said “after you die you become one of them” he was referring to him being a ghastly after so you might just see ball of gas and not char
At first I was like how did he get so strong but then I remembered he is level 98 and he just evolved which give like a 2x multiplier or something like that
ITS BEEN 2 YEARS?!
19:38 would be just stop talking about the gods
Bruh one episode is taking like 3 years
whens the next coming out i been waiting so long cant wait
this video has god of war thingy☠️
“Something” was the last word in this episode?????
This was uploaded in 2021? Damn
Part 11
Where’s 11&12
2:32 no way squirtle really said so longe bidoof
mewto is a nice guy
Will thete be an ep 11
Can you please make11 please make it?
2 years?!
Moreee
When is number 11 going to come out?
i wish there is ep 11 by now but i mean they only have gotten 2 YEARS (i hope its almost done)
at this point were gonna have gta 6 before ep 11
The entirety of Skibidi toilet was made AFTER this episode
Wow, I guess Kendrick was right. "Fuck the big three it's just big me."
GTA six will be out before the next episode💀
I wonder what Piplup is doing at this time?
I will faint all Caterpies from now on in the games
Bro it's been 2 years when are we getting another episode
6:06 6:38 12:04 20:03 22:19
Really been 11 years and it still has yet to finish 💀
You should ep 11 where ctarmander come back to life the starter Squad is back to together
WHEN IS NUMBER 11, DAMN YOU!!
Chimchar is an asshole tbh
I think wartortle is too op. Atleast make it a hard fought fight.
Its b33n 2 years man, pls post
Quien diría que una serie parodia terminaría con una historia bien definida con desarrollo de sus personajes,simplemente una obra de arte!!❤️
I was playing Pokémon Sword when the Alolan Ninetales dex entry reminded me of this episode. The entry I'm referring to is this one: "A deity resides in the snowy mountains where this Pokémon lives. In ancient times, it was worshiped as that deity's incarnation." Differently from other dex entries, this one doesn't say "Legends say that a deity resides[...]" It just flat-out says that there is a deity up the mountain. I wonder if this is intentional or just a coincidence. It seems too specific to be intentional, but if it is I'mma go insane.
i hate how he killed charmander
With Bulbasaur having been there, wonder if he told Squirtle that Charmander had been there to save him. Maybe even chewed him out for doing nothing, and that’s one of the reasons he didn’t wanna leave with Squirtle. Would’ve added to Squirtle’s guilt knowing that Charmander had been changing, but then HE was the one who didn’t let him.
When will episode 11 be made
I wonder what happened to the Caterpies.
You need to make more of these they are the best where is 11 and 12 we need it
POV: me checking if they’ve made a new episode every 6 months
God i hate that caterpie xd
Still no new episode.
The fact that water turtle beat Obama snow is crazy. He has a four time weakness to Obama snow and plus if Charmander was a little smarter, he could’ve won against the Caterpie.
Bro squirtles about to beat the gods into a bloody pulp 💀
It’s been two years
2 years for one ep is crazy
I feel like I've been living under a rock i just finished all 10 episodes and wow this is funny as all hell
Will another episode be made ?
Rip charmander  -Episodes 1-9
When Charmander is heaven right now he's going to be saying wait He evolved and I didn't
Stumbled across this today for the first time watched all 10 absolutely hilarious
I want a space tree return
I wait since 2 years , when are you going to finish the episode 11 ? I mean , i could wait a few months, but  not more of 2 years
OMG!!!! That was amazing I love the way Squirtle transformed into wartortle Im gonna give it a 10000000/10 for sure ❤❤❤❤😍😍😍
I have waited 2 years for episode 11
bro when is episode 11
His name is not stikle or but his name is turtwig
His not buley his Squirtle
I like turtwig❤
Still waiting
If yall didnt know the text on the caterpillars hat says: victory
When is the new episode
Who is been waiting for a new one since 2020
Does anyone know the end music it’s so good and want to listen to more
When is ep 11 coming?
So, there's season 2 somewhere?
Credits to /BSM/ everyone
The music after wartortle said "something" was so cool😍
I'm here waiting for another episode
So can make sense
Why is Squirtle in the sinnanon region  Shouldn’t Squirtle be in the Johto region?
Why is Charmander dead? Why why why😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why is Charmander dead? Why why why
Snow is in da wæh
CERULEAN CAVE, THEY NEED TO MEET HIM AT CERULEAN CAVE
Im not trying to be mean but think that gta 6 will come out before the next episode of this will come out i mean its been nearly 3 years since  this episode came out
I see this going one of two ways. Option one is that charmander eventually becomes a powerful gengar with all his memories intact.  But i feel like it's more likely that wartortle probably becomes a blastoise at that point that will convince the pokemon gods up the top to send wartortle back in time and he will prevent charmander death. Probably in hopes of also stopping missngno
Two years ago...
I hope Charmander and Bulbasaur coming back
DId anyone else notice, Mewtwo fighting the glitch at 12:51 , I think the glitch will have something to do with reviving Charmander.
i should’ve never watched this series i’m addicted
How was this two years ago already?!?
"Well they're not here!" Nice
Thinking about it, Charmander’s death is like ironman’s death. Everyone wishes it never happened, or they want them to be brought back.
It's so cool to see chimchar and turtwig have their own personalities but still wind up having the same fate, with char dying and bud leaving
I think this surpassed being a parody of pokemon red quite some time ago. not complaining
What the fu-   *get obliterated*
“I resemble the ultimate authority!”  *proceeds to die*
Bro in my head I was laughing because squirtle  just evolved then said “move” as if he was also a god
Omg it’s been a while😢
I like it when the graphics get better as time goes by, like in the flashback where Squirtle is fighting a bird the graphics are worse than in the scenes further in time. It's really a small detail but still a relatively good one!
episode 11 and 12 and 13 is taking way to long
Is there season?
Guys this is so period
WHEN PART 11 PLS I BEG YOU I WI DO ANYTHIGH
I wonder how things ended up with Mewtwo and Missingno.
24 is sat not 23
It's been 10 years bro, I've literally started watching this same year i started playing destiny, and i am 30 now, I'm trying to- nay, i need close some open pages from my 20s, i took an L with thundercats(2011), young justice is still a coin flip, but this, needs an end, i need closure 😂😭🙏
😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🔥❤️‍🔥🦎 he.s. died
When 11?
It has been 2 years
This proves that..  Why misty loved water types and hated insect types.. 😂😂
Bro it is just charmander in a different sole and bubasure is the same thing just.an idea
Bro make a season 2 pls I will subscribe and follow and share.and everything else
Who’s here in June?
12:50 mewtwo????
ITS BEEN 2 YEARS I NEED EP 11 PLS
i need to see this series end i have lived my entire life waiting for new episodes i need to see it completed
Truly a masterpiece
Also I really want to see bulbasuar as a venasaur
Episode 11 pls
Im from 2 years in the future there its still no chapter 11 JSJSJSJSJS
To think that I started watching this when I was like 7 and I'm 15 now insane
Oh my god squirrel is a badass
It's been 2 years dude. Where's the new one? Argh!
It doesnt take this long to make these animations... Hes just stopped
i hate the part were he say were not gonna stand there and watch u die 2:41
When tf are the next episodes coming out 🙄
HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE HIGHEST QUALITY THING I’VE EVER SEEN ON YOUTUBE  I love this series
The bidoof that loves being kicked lives rent free in my head 😂
Any  decade now the next video will come
I wanted chalmander to evolve.
Why  did you kill   chramander  in   show   man
Squirtle je my worst Pokémon en caterpie too
No 😪
WHY YOU  KILLE CHARMANDER😡
Is that the girl cars voice from a cars life?
It’s 2024 and no ep11
i have theory on how charmander is gonna come back i think mewtwo reviv him because in episode 8 mewtwo told charmander to meet him at cerulean cave  and charmander died to the caterpie and mewtwo found him and revived him to clean up the whole missing.no thing and charmander is still probaby lurking somewhere trying to get revenge because squirtle betrayed him
6:10  I’M A BIRD! TWEET TWEET!
Still no new episode?
Did yall notice the hat in the back its chamender's head 😥
I hope Charmander gets another chance to live, what if they take his head to a fossil reviving machine and bring him back to life?
I can’t wait to see Wartortle become a Blastoise at level 100. Let’s do this! This will rock!😎👍🏻
Chimchar sucks and he is a bad replacement for charmander.
Honestly i was surprised they killed of Charmander I didn’t think they would do it. I personally didn’t like Charmander but I honestly, starting to feel bad not gonna lie.
this is so funny 🤣1:59
13:37
❤
Wartortle is definitely turning into a blastoise next episode he is almost level 100 at the beginning of the episode turtwig said that he was level 98.
It took me 2 years to realise the 10-year time skip is a reference to how Diamond and Pearl released 10 years after Red and Green.
That "What the fu- was persanal
When will Ep 11 and 12 come out I have been waiting for a 2 year
Wait, what happened to Blue? Shouldn't Bulbasaur been picked to when red picked squirtle?
If they make a 11 it probably be to do with legendary Pokémon
It's been 2 year I swear if this ain't the most jaw dropping animation I am done with this series
Who here likes ash better then red
I love your videos I want more of this show
Here’s my film theory. It’s been 2 years since the this episode came out. I think they’ll be finished by very late 2024 or mid 2025
It has bin two years
That worm is EVIL!!!!!!😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬
I like the part when Squirtle evolved
yo 2 years later and this seems like a cinematic masterpiece
I want this series to end before I die
A esperar tres años mas para el siguiente episodio
What does piplup have to say about this
My theory for Episode 11 and 12 since it been 2 years. The Pokemon that will be found at the top will be Mewtwo and/or Missing No. I am thinking Mewtwo because look back at one episode where we never had Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle go to Cerelean Cave to face Mewtwo, so maybe Mewtwo is what Wartortle going to face at the top. But at same time. Missing No could be at the top since who knows how strong it gotten since the last time we saw Missing No.  Another theory here since in this Episode. Squirtle evolve at Level 99 to Wartotle. I do believe in Episode 11, Wartotle evolve to Blastoise at Level 100. Episode 12, Blastoise Mega Evolves to Mega Blastoise, Blastoise uses his Z-Move, OR Blastoise Dymamaxes. I know they aren't in Kalos, Alola, or Galar. But it could be possible that one of these 3 things happen. I am thinking the Mega Evolution got the most likely chance of happening.
Hopefully next year theres a new episode
I'm sorry for your death Squirtle
2 years and stlll no new ep
"oh cool what are you gonna ask?" ... "Something." *Walks off epicly*
TZZYUN
The writing written on the back of Charmander‘s head says victory, since after a long time, Caterpie actually won
Como se llama la canción del final,no la de los créditos,la del final del episodio?
I wonder what happened to piplup
so I guess this series is dead then, coming up 2 and a half years since the last episode official episode(halloween spinoff doesn't count)
hi shippidge i love your stuff but please give us a teaser or something youve been edging us too long and i cant take it anymore
Series Dropped After Charmander's Death. Who's with me?
im still waiting….
Where’s episode 11??????
Warturtle whint full Kratos
You have two make the12
You should make an Nother one where Squirtle and Charmander and Bulbasaur meet back up just like in the beginning but instead at the end
it is kind of sad
12:51 mewtwo is there for a bit
If charmander doesn’t come back I’m actually going to lose it
and were still waiting....
"The last flashback I had was about 3 years ago"☠  I kinda wanna see that flashback tho
WHAT THE FU-
22:59
22:55
volta com essa serie
I love how snover talk lol
It's safe to say that fire type pokemon are just hot headed.
Hey shippiddge im your big fan and I just wanted to say I love your work on this serie... And I don't know if you give on this serie or something but I just wanted to say that your work is great... Maybe even for last episode you could do like after Squirtle or Blastoise could "ask" dialga to return him to his past and then Squirtle could fix his mistake
man.. where’s the next episode? I know it takes time to do, and your works is greatly appreciated, it’s all understandable. But please, this is taking too long man, just how many views do you need to upload the next one, come on man!
"Char needs me! I would go to the ends of the earth for him!" When you realise Squirtle really means Charmander in that line...😢😢 Poor thing
🫲🤬🫱2
Hey can you make season 2 because I really like it ❤❤❤
I remember being so upset and so mad at Charmander dying 2 years ago 😂😂😂😂 This is nostalgic 😮
Cant believe this was already 2 years ago...
2024
Wartortles voice is a little to deep for a second stage evolution if anything his voice should've been relatively the same except a bit deeper the super deep voice he has now should've been used for blastoise.
I love the bidoofs ❤️ I hope Bulbasaur is still alive I LOVE the snovers ❤
11 11 11 11 11 episode
Plot twist idea: Dialga & Palkia didnt order Snow to do anything.....
I remember when this was immediately posted now it’s already been 2 years and this fantastic series is still not finish😢😢
I love how Wartortle’s voice was so masculine compared to Squirtle’s
Why did you never finish this
Bro is still walking after 2 years I wonder if he made it yet
Squirtle did it!
What happened to piplup
Dude, when the first episode of this came out, I was so young. I still love starter squad, and I cannot contain myself till the next episode(s) I feel such nostalgia, and even tears come to my eyes when thinking about this.
i'd say 9 episodes is the full series
Had to nerf charmander, his evolution wouldve been cracked
Chimchar famous last words : remember I hate both of u  More then u ever know
11🥹🥹
Um I don’t think Charmander deserved to died😢
If Bulbsaur died I will stop watching starter squad!
Where is charmander:(
In 12:51 Mewtwo is there
squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel of the squel
So it turns out charmander won't return...I'm going to be dissapointed for all of eternity
Come on bro it’s episode is really good
My god.. to think that this series first began in 2014, and it has already been 10 years To put it into perspective, I was in PRIMARY SCHOOL (UK) when this started.. and now I have left college this year and currently in a full-time employment. WOW
I know charmander will back and alive
Man is been two years since we had a starter squad😢
''me still waiting for episode 11''
Is Charmander is about to come back
My tree feeling
I will never stop coming back here
please make episode 11
Can you bring charmander back please 😢
WHEN IS A EP11 COME OUT
TBH watching that made me feel like you just gave up and wanted to hurry up and write an ending so you could be done with it. Thanks / no thanks for making us falsely think there was going to be more.. I'm not sad It's over I'm mad it's over! 😠
Personally I think it would have been better if you would have had them do some version of video game reincarnation or something. There's still too much left unanswered.
Where's 11 and 12 dude, you just going to give up on it and leave everyone hanging!!? 😠
NOOO NOT THE CLIFFHANGER!!! I MUST SEE THE WARTORTLE SLAY THE GODS OF POKEMON SOE EVERYONE CAN HAVE FREE WILL!!!
I think thats were Charmander is😮😮
Lame charmander died bye😒
I hope he makes more
Only if Charmander never killed Pablo he would’ve have lived but he still be a Charmander
amigo esto se esta poniendo muy bueno
Wait I think they should make a what if Charmander didn't die!
Why inside the flash back the world is broken but after flashback its not broken
What happened to caterpie if squirtle saw them again he would probably ambush them
Cant believe it was 2 years ago
24:21
give more eps
What is a good thing I know
This was 2 years ago? Wow
i'm starting to wonder if thats the end
Omg master ceterpie wearing a CHARMANDER HEAD!
Charmander s retorn ? On episode 11
Charmander s retorns
I refuse to believe this came out 2 years ago, Time flies so fast 🥲
😭RIP charmander
Can you make Starter Squad (Ep.11)
No episode 11???
GTA 6 is coming out before this series ends💀
His friends die😢😢😢
When I saw this I was so sad dude why did y’all have to kill off CHARMANDER?? 😭
Cant believes  its been 2 years
Squartal should meet another charmander but different a different personality
why does squirtle sounds like Rick from Rick and morty
Squirtle's flashbacks are insane
the abomasnow said arceus in japanese
BRAZILIANS ARE WANTING TO CONTINUE THIS WONDERFUL SERIES   🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤🫶🫶🫶
Not gonna lie, I keep thinking the title is "shell of a guy" and I can't unsee it.
this was 2 years ago. how time flies 💀
24:20 i need that song
The first 9 episodes were my childhood, im so glad we got a continuation, i love this series
I want charmander and  bulbosaur
I want episode 12
333
Dude 2 years have passed since this? Absolutely crazy!
The way things are going, GTA VI will be released before chapter 11 of starter squad.
24:21 that song is so good bro
I’m a birrrrddddd tweeeeeet tweeeeeeeeet
I bet that bolbasor is gana play a huge roll in the future
👇Episode 12
pls part 11
22:54  WHAT THE FU-
SpongeBob's talking to himself again😂 also naruto?😂   Jk salute to the VA's
"A rehash of Charmander but WORSE"
Man's is gonna fight God😂
PLEASE PLEASE lvl 100 blastiose eps 12 Edit its cuz hes a lvl 99 warturtle
Could you please leave us a comment on when episodes 11 &12 will come out please?
COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make episode 11,12 as charmander goes alive with bulbasaur not caught by baby butterfly because now I am hating your idiotic story . Change up
I just realized that Squirtle said, "you have got a lot of nerve," at 4:59, a catchphrase said throughout the series.
Now episode 11 could come out any second, any minute, any hour, Any day, any week.
I just realised how poetic this episode is, the 2nd team disbanded in the same way the first did, bulbasaur had left, charmander died in his mission of becoming the strongest and squirtle had stayed. The new team had squirtle stay and turtwig leave, and chimchar died trying to get strong by himself. Crazy how I didn't get that, but amazing series! I've been watching since the start of the series.
Caterpie is no better than Charmander when he killed him..
bro when will new ep come its  been 2 years
YOOOO EDATLIN HOLY SHIT
where episode 11 bro 2 years
Common make the second to last chapter pls🙂
1:53 JUST USE ROLL OUUUUUUTTTTTTT
it's crazy to compare squirrel's voice changing from episode 1 to episode 10 I mean it's been 10 years. man!
What happened to piplup? Because there’s always a water starter too lol
This is actually a terrible strategy, delaying evolution. Prevolves stats don't increases as much when leveling up. You completely gimped your blastoise.
22:02 is prob my favorite part i love it when he evolves.
20:02 Caterpie acting like Napoleon here. There is truly nothing we can do.
WHAT THE FF-💥
Hot take but I miss whiskers and andrew/sandslash i wish they came back
Holy shit has it been two years already
charamander turned into a gastly in a song if you havent seen it
He could come back some how maybe
When is ep11
No way this was almost 3 years ago, I remember it's release like yesterday
i like how it atarted in gen 1, but then 10 years later, it was in gen 4, the accurate time and dates
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE MEWTWO IS THIS FORSHADOWING
Bro, when will u make part 11? 😅😊
Friendly reminder that all of this happened because Red picked Squirtle instead of Charmander
The way my eyes widened upon seeing caterpie’s hat
Holy Sh!t, Has it really been 2 YEARS!!
“WHAT DA FA-“
Still peak
This series is honestly bad after charmander die and keeping caterpie alive is horrible. Honestly idk why the writer is taking so damn long. Episode 11 better be worth it or it represents that the animator is mentally ill like the caterpie, making terrible decisions. The person behind the channel must be lazy as hell.
If a wartortle ends up beating the shit out of arceus I’m gonna start crying laughing
Bro I remember watching this a few years back, pls make more 🙏 😭
21:39 The way he said "we" instead of "you" shows that he acknowledges that he made mistakes by not taking responsibility for what happened in the past and letting everything go too far, but switching to "you" also means that he wants Abomasnow to see that he is responsible also for following his Gods, similar to how Squirtle thought he had to follow whoever orders him around.
😢 please charmander back
12:09 I just realized this spearow was also a leader of his own clan like Caterpie is to theirs because of the bandana on his head. He was also on a revenge for the Fearow's death, the Fearow was probably his older brother or father.
give wartortle a lozenge
I honestly miss Charmander, like I bet he is a Gastly by now- Also W Spearow is the bird-bird!
Give us a part, let me please. We was begging for everybody to say. It's just please give us part 11.
This is so nostalgic
im back and its not out its been 2 years
This episode was boring
Bro its been two years lets go get episode 11
Damn, the quality improve crazy i cant imagine 11 episode
i wonder if Squirtle will go to cerulean cave to meet mewtwo
part 11
When does episode came out the relationship with me and one of my best friends who I fell in love was sinking and it was all because of me I had trauma that I didn't know how to organize let alone deal with I wanted to love my family and I wanted them to love her because she acts just like I did before I completely lost myself I saw this episode a week or two after we stopped talking I deleted her number Instagram everything and I was in more pain than I ever was and my family didn't help me worth a damn and all I went through with them was bulshit boyfriends when I saw this episode for the first time I decided to clip when Squirtle evolved in the speech right before he lost charmander and now chimchar in what he said when he evolved about suffering under people and following rules that just end up hurting you and the people you love in the end that and everything my crush physically gave me was all I needed to keep going and now I am independent and shes coming to visit me I'm going to show her the love we both need
11?
@00:27 Israel be like …
This is amazing please make a episode 11
wow so depressing after charmander's death squirtle just continued slaving away for the caterpie
Amazing!!!!!
6:09 IM A BIRD TWEET TWEET, BIRD SOUNDS, BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME, THEY DO. I AM TOO MUCH OF A BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD HOAHH BIRD
This animation single handedly made that Pokémon at the end one of my favorites.
11:36 squirtle mistaking him as his old friend bulbasaur is sad asf
Please additional of episode 11 and 12.. make 2 or 3 episodes about the war again Bird 🐦🕊️...
I like the boss batle
14:16 R.I.P society of Noctowls 😔
this sucks... Charmander would have never died...
How did charmander die?
la verdad estan seguros de que sacaran otro capitulo mas por que ya ha pasado un año y nada
BRO THIS IS ALRADY 2 YEARS AGO??? I WAS LITERALLY THINKING JUST NOW THINKING “hmm it came out like a year and a bit ago around April or may 2022 or something” DAMN THOUGH 22.11.23
How emotionless can you be?  Squirtle from 12:04 till 13:45 : Yes
Yoo
Make a new episode
uhhhhh what happened to bulbusaur  edit nevermind he stayed a slave
Did no one else notice mewto?
Isn’t me or Chimchar sounds like Tara strong?
nah charmander isnt dead he will heal his head back because the tail is not cut off
11:00 is actually crazy lmao
bro is literally the kratos of pokemon
got damn man wtf. This existed for 2 years and I'm just now finding it. This is top quality stuff.
Caterpie really just abandoned Squirtle after putting him and the area they were in through so much suffering. I hope Caterpie died or something.
Please, Wartortle, bring Charmander back to life. That would be the greatest thing ever.
FUCK SQUIRTLE ALL MY HOMIES HATE SQUIRTLE
I love how the story goes from 0 to 1000! Like the show started from a simple comedy with a simple story to a fully fleshed out drama! 10/10, a studio needs to give you funding for this!
How did you get Ed atlin to be in this video or as he calls it Vicho
Bro snow is just zamasu
It’s fr been 2 year damn
The green pokemons nome is girt tuig
Bro been gone for one year and then comeback and left us two years
When episode 11?
Aww the turtwig was so cute
Wow, I never knew this episode existed...level 98?!
this series is why wartortle is one of my favorite pokemon :)
I really want to see squirtle fight arceus or giratina after fighting palkia and dialga
Yo can you do one more
Charmander Was my favorite character ad well but now I wonder about episode 11
What happened to the glitch and mewtwo problem tho, seems like the story moved away from it without a solution
This series is forever a YouTube classic of mine ever since I first found the first episode back in 2013 when I was 13.
God Of Wartortle !
12:51 mewtwo continues his duel with missing no
I completely forgot about this from my childhood and watching it again is amazing
damn you this is good also please dont take around a year to make episodes its boring waiting
how the crap was this 2 years ago already-
The big fat beaver us my fav character now
Interesting how the most simple one got the best ending
Make charmander come back
2 YEARS ALREADY
breh i want charmander back
Mewtwo?
I vibe with these Snovers, best hypemen ever
10:55 Squirtle calls Turtwig Blubasaur.
My guy just decimated a vessel of the gods in his middle evolution 💀
Shiny bidoof?
22:47 patrick?
Did anyone else see mewtwo fighting something at 12:50
So when's the next episode?
I watched all of the episodes
Took you long enough to make another episode
I feel bulbasaur will go to find mewtwo at cerulean cave
Bros about to pull a kratos
4:46 LOLOLOL
Do all Pokémon reigons
The people who rewatch the old episodes out of boredom  👇
Why do these take so long out of curiosity
*My area* Got me rolling around on the floor
2 years already?
A true fool, he created a mindless soldier to do his bidding and destroy all in his path, and then begged the same shell of a person for advice, his rage blinded him for years, he thought he wanted to lay waste to this land, but in the end.. he realized that wasn’t what he wanted, long after it had already been too late
The ending was firee🔥🔥
It’s been two years 🎂
Kinda weird hearing caterpie cheering "Bluey" on as he murders a fearow.  And ordered "Bluey" to kill 😂
GUYS STARTER SQUAD EP 11 COMING IN BEGINNING OF 2024 Edit: August 9, 2025 12:34AM, GMT+8 Timezone, Episode 11 is never coming. It has been forsaken. We have been forsaken.
R.I.P leonard😭
Damn it's already been 2 years.
He's still making this, right? He's just taking a little while? Because i've been checking this for quite some time now it feels like.
MAKE EP 11 ALREADY
anyone else just randomly remember this series and check if theirs's a new episode
I really want charmander back he was the best I liked all the eps he was i
I'm still waiting btw
GOW lore be like:
PLS I WANT NEXT EPISODE HAVE AGAIN CHANDAR BEACUSE WITHOUT HIM I DONT REALLY LIKE THE EPISODES
can you put to next episode the fire lizaed?
I’m guessing Lucas chose Pilpup and Squirtle took advantage of this to claim himself as the water-type of the Gen 4 Starters.
Damn just realized Squirtle is gonna fight fukin Arceus. Snow said it was aruceusu but... I'm pretty sure it's just Arceus with his old time wisdom accent.
I'm impressed.  FUCKING impressed.
Squirtle accepts himself and evolves into one of the best 2nd starter evolution ever 🥶
when will be episode 11?
Wheres the ep 11 its been 1 year
6:38 Squirtle Used Outrage! It’s Super Effective!
thank you for existing
Make Ep.11 pls
Can't wait for the next episode we know it takes a few years for this to be designed and the battle mechanics and animated but keep up the great work we all look forward to watching the channel grow
I love wen he ivolved
Could we maybe get an update? I started on episode 5 and this is hell after it was hyped up on the teaser 😂😂😂
I want charmander back 🙏🙏
Its been a year still waiting for 11
Bro imagine if charmander actually lived in ep 11
Soon enough, two years will have passed, and this still feels like it came out just a few weeks ago. I really don't mind how long the next episode is taking, I feel like the more time passes between episodes, the more I can use them as "checkpoints" for my life. Part of me just straight-up doesn't want the next episode to come out, just so I can keep telling myself that the series isn't over yet
Chimchar has appeared!
I wonder if charmander will come back
And 12
I hope Wartortle climbs the mountain and somehow makes Charmander revive with the help of Mewtwo or whatever.
Legend🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
When comes the next part from starter squad or When come this part in german out?
How did Bluey end up in Sinnoh?
رووووووعة جداا❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 واوووووو 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope that there will be a Charmander in 11 12
Plot twist as he charges the finishing blow he dies from hail damage.
Imagine Wartortle dies from hail damage
I wish charmander didn’t die😢🦎🦎
Yessir next eps this year
Please do starter quad  11
6:19 Bird sounds come out of me
What happened to bulbasuar I miss him so much his my fav bc his so wholesome and cutest❤ 😢
*Spoiler Alert:*    *Dialga* will be in the next episode.
when squirtle evolve he became warturtle but the way he talked is like kratos
When is ep 11 coming it has been a year?
Come on Shippiddge. It's been a year... We need MORE, the cliffhanger is killing me! Lol
i still hate squirtle for not saveing charmander >:(
When is he posting episode 11
Man after wartotle jumped was like what the fu
The most hype video of all time
Bro like i can't believe charmander died it would be awsome if squirtle went back in time and saved him
are you dead
I miss the old charamander squirrel and bulbasaur , if only charamander didn’t die
My theory:Bulbasaur realized that the Caterpie army wanted to start a war and just ran off, he found a trainer with other Pokémon’s and was able to evolve to venusaur. Word is spreading about squirtle reaching farther and farther up the mountain and Bulbasaur, his trainer and the rest of the Pokémon start heading there. when they referred to the Pokémon gods, it was arceus,dialga,palkia, and giratina. Squirtle challenges giratina to a real Pokémon battle, since he is pretty much responsible for Charmander‘s death. during the battle Squirtle is able to evolve into blastoise. Squirtle obviously loses but giratina sees what Squirtle is worth and they decide to help him. Dialga says is that he is able to send him back in time to save Charmander but with the rule that he cannot come back to the top of the mountain, from where he was sent. Squirtle accepts the deal and is sent back. he is transformed back into his original form and is a minute away from the Charmander  getting executed. Squirtle rushes in to save Charmander but the leader of the Caterpie army realizes what he is about to do. They end up getting into a battle, and they all start fighting. Charmander gets back up and both Charmander and Squirtle work together to take them down. Squirtle tells Charmander about everything that has happened while he was dead and Charmander starts to realize that Squirtle was really a true friend. Charmander has a flashback about everything that he and Squirtle has been through. they both get Bulbasaur and they leave. they are able to catch up to sandslash and they all decide to make a team. they find this trainer and they all are with him now. they become a great team, and live happily ever after.    The end.
BRING CHARAMSNDER BACK PLS
Bro 💀 I have been waiting for 1 yearrr... Where is the next episode
You need to make more of this
😎😎😎😎😎
UNTIL YOU MAKE EPISODE 11 AND 12 IM NOT FUCKING BREATHING
Did you drop the Mewtwo storyline?

The Cerebus Effect is a trope that is defined by a work starting out in a comedy-adjacent tone or genre that either quickly or by a not so slow burn turns into a drama with a more serious tone, the trope-namer being Cerebus, a comic book series that in the beginning was comedic and episodic, but turned more gritty and dark over time.
Estarño a Charmander
22:56 best scene of this besides the missing no and geodude scenes
can you make more videos 📹
What happened to piplup?
Please make it 11 please I’ve been waiting for two years now…
Can’t wait for episode 11 and 12
On bro y’all ruined the whole series with this new charmander and squirrel shit fr fr
Blue shell man will maybe beat up the hell out of godzilla
when is episode 11 coming out
Damn people was crazy a year ago, creating unbelievable, stupid, ilogical and ridiculous scenarios where Charmander appears again and refusing to accept he is dead, or refusing to accept he murdered a surrendered caterpie. 10/10 would evolve again
Crazy how it been 1y already 💀
When ep 11 and ep 12
the cooooooooooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉
please bring Charmander back he is best
Where is Charmander? Did he die in the war
Squirtle don’t evolve
I hate the worms
After 3 years since last episode he returns
Was there a sister freide reference in the return from whence you came?
Guys I think they Squirtle and Bulbasaur will try to find Charmander's corpse and head then uses a revive
Man kratos looks different
When is episode 11 and 12 gonna come out it's been 1year now
He's a level 96 and he just evolved into Warturtle when he took the stone off. He should of skipped Warturtle and turned into Blastoise lol
Part 11 pls
oh yeah i forgot that the mewtwo part was talking charmander to meet him at cerulean cave guess its not happening anytime soon since he's dead.. wait what if mewtwo saved him? oh welp
Big tree guy basically the whole time: Respect mah athorataaaaa!
The soul of carmendar is gonna be missed he was little died from finding friend😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Forgot about this so i watched this masterpiece again and god it only gives me more hype for the next episode
I wonder when the next videos will be out
😂 make a party 11 please
Part 11 pls
21:17
God they’re in Sinnoh now? Yikes my dude, yikes. I can already hear Cynthia’s approaching theme from here, by bud Wartortle will be in a world of pain I tell ya XD
I think this squirtle is a a ditto,he probably was piplup and transformed into squirrels dead body since he can’t survive in the wild,therefore inheriting all his memories
13:12 nickeh30 when someone doesn’t follow his role-play rules
R.I.P CHARMANDER 😢
Will there be episode 11,12 and 13 😶‍🌫️
What the fu-
Ghosh, cant believe that's already 10 years. cant wait to see what next
Squirtle: I - I I’m not afraid! Me: no but SUPERafraid!
Umm me saw wast ep I must know if character is still alive!
My prediction is that the gods / god is a charizard with half of his head missing does that soun familiar???😧😧😧
Bring back charmander
episode 11 is probably releasing in November or December
Well it got dark after episode 9..
I like the plot twist with charmander dying but it could have been a good opportunity to make my evolve because he killed over 20 Caterpie‘s at the same time while he was trying to survive squirtles water attacks he took so much damage and he could have had a Pokémon anime evolution, but I still like the plot twist keep up the good work❤
this is sick i watch the whole thing
Bro this turned into a meme to a dark story.😭💀
see u guys in the next 7362772)uwuqy$/)261718 years

This Is Truly Sad Squirtle Literally Watched His Friend Die And Mostly Because Of His aactions
Why isn't ep 11 coming?
idea if you  make seris starter squad but the chosen one at firs is charmander
Bro the next episode pls 😢😢
i still await the next episode
next episode guess: Palkia and Dialga bring back the squad
He is gonna give heaven to Pokémon god's like he said to chimchar that he would be giving them hell if chimchar evolved
I had just died over a dumb charmander death counter
why is turtwig the most based character in the story so far
Charmander just should not have killed Pablo and things would have been different
Pease bring ack Charmander next episode
im still sad about charmander dying :(
Is he death ?
I just wanted the 11th episode make ‘em quick I’m freaking out😭  Plus  I Hope Theres a season 2  Maybe charmander will come as a ghost or something???  SHIPPIDDIGE PLEASE I WANT THE 11TH EPISODE I HAVENT WATCHED THIS IN YEARS IM BEGGING U
Is the series going to continue?
Charmander is still alive he is going regrow his head bc he is lizard
where is piplup
And Wartortle is fuckin beautiful 😍
Squirtle ana turtwig saved chimchar 😊
21:55 I love this scene, especially when Squirtle evolve himself into Wartortle!
I know Squirtle is doing a good thing...but I hope Chimchar stays dead. I hate him so much.
“BEING SLIGHTLY BIGGER CHANGES NOTHING!” - last words before abomasnow dies to (You guessed it), a slightly bigger squirtle.
Can someone tell me what happened to Bulbasaur
I love ❤️ charmander more but killed
I hate Charmander and Chimchar died they should come back as Gastly Hunter said when pokemon die they turn into Gastly (boo!) LOL in my gastly voice
Do part 11 please
Do part 11 it’s been so long
Do part 11 please it’s been so long
Killing off charm lander was such a bad idea
Hi can you finish the mewtwo and missingno arc
Squirtle starter kill count 2 charmander and chimchar
wheres bulbausaur
can believe squirtle is kratos now
Is no one talking about metwo
Mewtwo?
Make them faster * me crying because it isn’t here yet* we need number 11 now I MEAN NOWWW
Mewtwo was fighting the monster glitch thing
I didn't even realize she was wearing charmander head damn hes really dead😢
The ending is shocking and so sad 😢😢
Where is bulbasaur?
guys  squirtle will fight red because the snowy mountains is where red is
Bring back Charmander!
please tell me charmander will help wartortle fight the gods as charmeleon
I don't know man. I love Starter Squad, and this episode's storytelling was amazing and super emotional, but I'm not sure if I love the direction they took with the show. I get the message, but killing off Charmander and making Bulbasaur useless just for Squirtle to have PTSD and travel to Sinnoh where he attempts to relieve his childhood wasn't the best way to continue the series IMO. I wish Charmander defeated the Caterpie Army and the three Kanto starters went on more adventures.
I Don't really understand this episode that much.Can someone explain it to me please?
Red needs to get evry pokemon in the factory
I predict that Mewtwo will be able to bring Charmander back because he is powerful. And also you can see mewtwo in this ep so he is def still part of the story line.
Hm, wonder where Piplup is
Theory when Sqruitle reaches the top he going to get dialga and go back in time to save charmander and get Bulbasuar than kill all of the caterpie and get out of the nest and they find mewtwo and he askes if they cleaned up the mess charmander made and they say yes and Mewtwo gives the XP and they evolve into they're final stages and go up mount Corentin and talk to acrecus and they defeat arceus and the rules go away freeing everyone. Or get palkia to go into a alternative dimension where charmander is alvive and where the rules dont exist and everyone is happy
Imagine if wartortle and mewtwo will team up to defeat that missingmo thingy .
Is squirtle's shade of blue make him a shiny?
CHARMADER NEEDS TO COME BACK!!!!
"Your heisenberg"
So Charmander started off as selfish, he still was, but when Squirtle tried to teach him that force isn't what makes a leader, he tried to use empathy and redeem himself by trying to save Squirtle. Squirtle was always trying to follow the rules unless someone he viewed as an authority figure tried to make him break them, but by doing what he's told he loses the one guy who actually viewed him as an equal and gave up his free will to not feel guilty for what Caterpie made him do. Now that he looks back on his past and tries to hold himself accountable, he sort of embodied Charmanders initial desire to evolve and his belief that the rules Squirtle followed were not worth it when following them caused him suffering.
é incrivel que a musica é os criadores e não o OST
What’s the outro music?
Why did charmander died
ES CINE 🚬🚬🚬
Rip charmander
We need part 11!
When the next one comes out I will ask u SOMETHING
I am so dissapointed that it had to end at episode 10 why cant he just make a compolation of ep 1-ep12 hurry up with the divelopment my son is probably  ganna be in my teens when ep 11and ep12 are relested
Millet yeni bölüm bence gelmeyecek 😢
Squirtle is gonna become the god of war
Pls make 11
Can you make a 11 and 12?
What year is episode 11 coming out? What day and month?
Well no more episodes???
You realise that Squirtles argument of learning higher moves at lower levels lost water (no pun intended) 58 levels ago.
Please bro we need a other one your doing good
I love chudul and I love turtle 🐢
It’s been a year 🎂
everyone’s talking about charmander and squirtle, but not bulbasuar? i mean, he’s not dead (probably) but yknow…he’s slowly rotting away—yknow being food and all- plus he was my fav character :’ (
charmander carried the series now it sucks
7:57 :(
Wait a second...abomasnow was guarding the mountain for his "master"... WAIT IS RED THE ABOMASNOW`S MASTER!
Anyone remember how in episode 8 the haunter said "This is what you become when you die" this tell us that there may be more charmander only as a ghost type pokemon Edit: tho it will probably not happen.
PLZ REVIVE CHARMANDER
this was uploaded?
21:00 the way she realizes what’s happened to squirtle is terrifying
Bulbasur is so cute 🥰
Liked the series but not watching the 10th ep I don’t like that chsrmsnder died
Bro Beaver society😂😂
WHERES THE NEXT PARTTTTT ❤❤
It’s been like a year and you still haven’t made another episode
I hope up the hill we can get Charmender back
But Why charmender is died i like him
when is Ep 11?
anyone think it's unfair that in episode 9 charmander only wanted to save squirtle and he ended up dying......
when is the next one comming?
Pls I want to see the next one when will it be here
Bro it's been a year where is part 11
"A true friend doesn't care if he's actually your friend. Some of my closest friends in the world have been my greatest enemies, and I've never even talked to them."
For 2 whole years I thought Charmander was still alive 🗿
Wow. I just started this whole series today and I saw this as a funny parody but when I kept watching, it ended being dark. Overall, this is extremely well done, I’ll wait years just for the next episode. Thank you Shippiddge and for everyone else who was included into making this masterpiece, amazing series.
When I saw this episode I’m pretty sure  Squirtle is going to go back in time to save charmander.
I assume whiskers commited suicide
😂
6:06 12:04 20:03 squirtle flashback
Wheres part 11
biddof slaying monke red man  0:19
Please make charmander alive in the next episode as charmeleon😭😭😭 I miss charmander so much😩
Charmander is definitely alive i feel like there are 3 things  1.he became a glitch like the manchamp least likely 2.mewtwo is gonna bring him back from the dead or replaced charmander with a dead one 3.that skull is like charmanders decay when he evolved
Chimchar just has too much independence thus turtwig was just to much of an ahole at 10:45   11:01   11:10   2:52
😢 I miss turtwig he’s was a good character 😢
Chimchar is like Charmander.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
can we do episode 11 please
I hope they get revive stone and revive charmander and he evolved into charizard and fucking kills everything
Even after 1 year this guy aint uploading
No way, i come back nearly 2 years later and no new episode yet
The snovers were absolutely great
Episode 11 needs charmander
How long till the next one
Please make episodes 11🙏
Ok I now hate this episode I hate that charmander died I really miss the other one and this one I hate it so much I'm thinking of charmander I said maybe he evolved but when I see caterpie's hat I thought its just a Christmas hat tht is orange but it's not it's charmander I hate this episode so much🤬
When did swhdl  become so bad ass 😮❤
The music for the ending credits is amazing. Love it.
Make a new sequel!!!!!!!
Did charmander die 😢😢
It's been a year daddy. I really really miss you.
I know I'm late it's just been a few years since this caught my eye. I was about 7 or 8 when I watched the first few episodes
I thought charmander would evolve and destroy all of them but man i didnt accpect this
Is there going to be more episodes?
Please more
My man waiting for new episodes
The way squirtle's voice went from a nerd to a fucking badass when he evolved to wartortle is immensely hilarious
What happened in those 2 years
I love the idea of the everstone being a limiter
why did you made the green worm where charmanders head^
The music, animation and story telling is very top notch.Props to everyone who worked on this masterpiece.
Bad but kinda good ending: Squirtle (Wartortle?) Loses everybody and goes to fight god
20:59 22:17
I personally think Wartortle is at his highest potential in this form. He is more agile like this than he would be as Blastoise.
I have an idea while wartortle is climbing up the mountain to find the gods with chimchar he will fight dialga then he will ask dialga to revive chimchar and bring back to time where charmander died and save charmander it sounds like a good idea to me please let charmander come back to revive or something I miss him make something about Arceus or pokemon gods to revive charmander please
7:57
CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
cant wait for episode 11 , meet yalll in 2 years
Charmamder will come back because he didn't complete his task for mewtwo
this entire series is a masterpiece
When is the next 😢
How has this man not evolved to the final if he’s fuckin lv 98
I watched this in high school and may possibly see the final episode as I graduate college
Something
Squirtle‘s friends die 😰😓
If you still make this show I have an idea  The gang go to gardvoir's mansion and charmander falls in love with kirlia
and so the game began:"POKEMON GOD OF WAR"
Please bring this back
do pt. 11 pls
When 11 epesoid come out
Obrigado por nunca desistir
Make the next one!
make ep 11
Please make more starter Squad episodes please don't end it at 12 please make more
😡😡
Where’s episode 11 is it in works
Bring back charmander he’s my favorite caricature
His name is Squirtle
Squirtle Logic:- Disobeying Charmander's command when he was his trainer and let him die because he killed some f*cking caterpies (for him and balbasaur)    Also Squirtle: obeying every single command of Caterpie and killed many flying and bug pokemons for that f*cking caterpie 😢
11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11
no way chimmy is fighting bidoofs
Please make episode 11 soon
A new protagonist has been born! Jokes aside... I miss Charmander... :(
3 years of waiting
Why are all fhe fire starers slain
PLZ FINISH THE SERIES BRO
And is it just me or I saw mewtwo
I love this
Squirtle shouldn’t bring Charmander in the Pokémon ball fast so he can not die
kinda cringy but its cool, some of the voices are kinda high and shrill and make my ears bleed but its fine.
do the voices change alot o something
I don't like how Charmaine died. I hope wartortle is able to go back in time and save him. Granted, Charmander did kind of have it coming.
I thought episode 11 already came out? Weird
I was expecting a stupid little two minute video about pokemon, not a wildly depressing and yet amazing cinematographic masterpiece
What's the goated song in the end?
Just found out about this today, now about to binge 😂😂😂
Its been a solid year maybe a sneak peak ?  BLAH!!!
I was half expecting Charmander to make an appearance but Squirtle was like nope he died. When he evolved into Wartortle to fight the tree god it reminded me of Kratos
It's been 3 years why haven't you posted🤨
And also squirrel savage
I need you to release the new one now I need to see it
Do a video with bobosour please
Turtwig: he's a level 98 Me: HOW DID HE LEVELED UP THAT MUCH!?
Episode 11 should be out soon
Started when i was 7 now im 16 or something
Bro you get rid of charmander
SyALkk😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Make a chapter 12
When is the next video bro
We need episode 11 it’s been over a year man come on don’t do this to us
Best last words ever 😂😂😂 22:58
20:55 This is one of the best moments in the series, perhaps the most emotional so far too. The realisation he/she had about Blue, the reality of it. He probably didn't even care what he/she would do to him, he just didn't want to take responsibility for his actions. And I don't think he even knew it till he got released...
Oh God I remember when this was new
Predictions: Obs the Sinnoh God's are going to turn back time. And Charmander will be back alive, BUT also: Near the end Charmander will start to evolve and stop himself. We will see Whiskers and Bulbasaur. Missingno will be the reason Pokémon are no longer slaves for humans. A Digimon will be included somehow.
Well this series went downhill fast  Hope it's redeemed with Charmander somehow making a comeback
This was worth the wait
Character analysis: Bidoof:not very good at fighting Chimchar:charmander but madder Big bidoof:fat and doesnt care Turtwig:bulbasaur but smarter Snovert:ANOYING!!!!!
Still waiting por chapter 11 😢
bro hurry up like daaaaaaaaamn
It would be cool if they make a episode 11 they find a secret revive to bring back charmander
nexed epesoid
SINNOH????????!!!!!!!!!!
charmander was the heart of this it’s not good without him
Abomasnow is now the only pokemon i'm afraid
22:18 LETS GO
Is that everstone squirtle was where is like a necklace stone stops the evolution that makes sense because squirtle took out that necklace he evolveed
I see a lot of parallels between this series and Charlie the Unicorn. Both animated comedy series. In both cases the episodes took way longer than originally promised to come out but in both cases it was worth the wait. Both started out fun and lighthearted but got pretty dark towards the end. Both have great musical numbers. Etc.
you should switch squirtles voices back, but in a funny way tho like "cough cough* smth was stuck in my throat" idk just some excuse
Am i the only one who misses Charmander? And the fact the squirtle calls chimchar the nickname "char" is so heartbreaking!!!!!😢😢😢😢
Why squirtle didn’t saved charmaner in episode 9 now I don’t like squirtle
im wait eps 11
💧💦☔️☂️🌊❄️☃️⛄️🌬💨🌧🌨🌴🌳🌲🌱🎋🍃🌿🎍🍀☘️🍂🍁💐🌷🌹🥀🌺🐚🌾🌿🍃🌸🌻🌼
I miss charmander man he was the soul of the series
This is kinda sad.  Squirtle had the chance to stop Caterpie from going back on her word, but he didn't.  Now Squirtle is suffering from survivors guilt because it took him this long for him to realize that he made the wrong choice and that Charmander was right all along.
i remembered this series 5 years later and theres only 2 new episodes lmao, love this series and glad i remembered it! hopefully the next episode will come out when i'm still alive
Damn I love the part when they put a god of war studd
11 12 🔥 come on
Ok
Imagine chimchar was charmanders reincarnation they have a lot a like
I have a gut feeling that Bulbasaur is at the top of that Mountain and is a Venusaur 24:35
"Snow way" says the Snover  Its funny cuz I named my Abomasnow "SNOW WAY!!" as a pun  didn think such a coincidence was possible.
I want  charmander back
WHEN WILL THE NEXT COME OUT TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bring back Charmander please😢
I hate how Charmander died, It was a bad way to go out, after he killed a whole army of caterpies. Still pisses me off and makes me sad that he isn't alive, but at least Squirtle evolved.
When will pt11 be here
Why don't they just take charmaders head to the pokemon center
This gives me God of War vibes
😔
IM A BRD TWEET TWEET
I hate episode 9 I hated him enough to unlike all of your videos and unsubscribe and not support you because of my second favorite Pokémon😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👹😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
Why is nobody talking about mewto flashing on screen for a half second
It’s been one year since this drop and I always come back for the snovers. They add so much while doing so little. Please send them more love ❤
we gonna see blastoise vs arceus??? 🤔
THIS ALREADY 1 YEARR AND THE EPISODE 11 AND 12 HAVENT DONE
This was amazing!
When is the next episode coming out?
I like how caterpie went from the villain who’s plans never work but never gives up to a literal evil dictator
Fuck caterpie omg
When is part 11 coming
I knew this series would go deep. But not THIS deep
Bro if charmander doesn't come back as a ghastly I'll be pretty sad
Why did Charmander have to die tho he was a badass
2:15 Squirtle: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like turtwig, I hope he returns
make more
Is 2023 he should make  part  11
What a outstanding development of squirtle, honestly you flabbergast me !
squirtle killed charmander, yet 10 years later, squirtle’s “oh so sad” about charmander getting killed. imagine killing one of your friends, and years later, you are so sad about it. that’s such a bozo move.
plz make the other epepsodes
I can tell Chimchar is racist
Charmander was the best part of the series 😡
Idk charmander needs to come back idc for the char monkey
Well red didn't get fire
this is so good nice job
Make one more episode plz!
Bulbasaur is just forgotten lol I love it
12:49 i dont think that was supposed to be there
Where is balbasour
Why is caterpie cute vruh
Bro, charmander started off as a bitch and now look at him. He tried to save his friend squirted and died in the process. Respect the character development. A lot of people loved squirtle initially but now a lot of people hate him. I still love squirtle though.
Chamander walked so squirtel could swim
Now that’s a masterpiece I wonder how your going to top this and looking forward to seeing it.😊
C'mon it's bin to Years and how Long does He's episodes take soooo long 😡(p′︵‵。)
It been 1 year but still no more!
I NEEED TO KNOW THIS IS A GREAT
What happens next
Charmander was literally my favorite pokemon
Intire
If charmander is dead you ruined the interest show
Duuude, what if.... ARCEUS COMES AND EVOLVE BULBASAUR NEXT TIME WE CAN SEE HIM!?
Remember when this series was funny?
Gotta wonder, is Chimchar being nicknamed Char, a nod to Turtwigs comment about them only being there so Squirtle can relive his childhood?
I'm Malaysia
I think Bulbasaur is gene be main character in  Episode 11 And Charmander Is gene be in Episode 12 After they all evolve they now make a reunion Together
Riolu or Lucario should be in this series…
THIS WAS MADE IN 2021 WHAT      TIME HAS GONE BY FAST.
11?
I said I’m not getting younger so please upload!!!
so no one remembers how Charmander accidentally brought upon the end of the world or some shit like that by killing hitmonchan
At lasyt Chimchar died pursuing his dreams. Unlike Charmander, cut down in his prime by the friend he was trying to save. Slain at the hands of the weak, those only able to take advantage of his compromised state after Squirtle weakend the proud Charmander. An act Squirtle performed after being commanded to by a pathetic worm! In summary, fuck you Squirtle/Wartortle you little prick, I hope you get fried soon⚡
What if Arceus is in next episode
Dude that's a great theory
14:15 oh…wow..
8:20 Hits different everytime it gets real
Btw altho Charmander might come back, I really like the fact that he is gone Not in a cynical way, but like story-writing. Stories like these have gotten really old It's always the same thing where it all works out, rince and repeat. So what you did with it is simply just more interesting Also, I'm considering this to b Season 2 lol  It's also really satisfying to see Squirtle suffer the consequences with those flashbacks of what happened w the side he chose Still not done w this episode but so far he still doesn't know that Charmander was trying to rescue him the whole time I supposed it's satisfying cuz it's also my own anger of watching Charmander go through all of that just to be brutally betrayed and misunderstood  Again, so much better story-writing than the same old "power of friendship" where it all works out rainbows n sunshine So now when that does happen, it'll definitely be earned
"Together we will find *Chumdar"* 😭
Bulbasaur And Charmander Glastrier Spectrier you have a good day at
I really miss Charmander he was doing much better, he simply just didn't like to show it.
R I P BIRD
Part 11!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TWEET TWEET I'M A BIRD
Please bring back charmander everyone wants him back
Give us charizard
Plz back charmendor
When the next episode going to come up
Aw fuck man they killed my boy Charmander I mean it's still cool but I wanted to see Charmander become the very best and become a good person along the way until he fought the gods and maybe sacrifice himself in some way you know all in a little bow.
22:58 Best
Idea Once your done with episode 12  new series Starter squad but the guy picks charmander
Man I hope jiggly puff will appear soon
(Ep.11) please
so, wartortle is going to make another squad? the new game starters?
Has anyone actually noticed that the snow protector thing just seems like an iced out version of abomasnow?
squirtle sucks, charmander better
I dont like Charmander became a monkey
I want Charmander back
13:42 this is the face of a man who’s lost friends and has been broken
Squirtle evolved into Kratos
7 years ago i had the time of my life watching those first few episodes and was so sad that there weren't more episodes. I coudn't be happier to find this treasure. You've unlocked such a happy memory for me. I love you. I look forward to the last 2 episodes.
When will they come out x.x
I thought flareoeon or sandslash saved him but 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wasn't really invested in the time skip or new characters.  I care about Bulba, Squirt and Charmander, not these new guys...
Post the last 2 episodes please
20:05
Dam charmander died lol
Where da next one
7 months I’m still waiting
You have ruined the series charmander was the series and now you decide to clip him
This really hurt to watch I gotta say you should do an alternate ending because killing charmander off really feels like a waste, 😢 rip charmander
You doin this on purpose? It's been a whole year mate and you haven't made episode 11:/
😄😄
finally
I'm going to be in a retirement home by the time this series ends
I really hate Squirtle for killing Charmander.
this not it like wtf the direction of the story really sucks
IM DONE OF THIS SERIES LIKE CHARMANDER IS MY FAVORITE WHY DID U KILL HIMMMMMMM AHHHHH IMMA NOT WATCH THIS EPISODE 10 - 12 BRUH
Overrated crap😒
Everyone knows dirtle solos
Already a year ago!
I hate that my _initial_ reaction to what was on Caterpie's head was "gee, where'd he get that Trainer-Hat...?" Only to realized soon after, _that was no hat..._ (ರ◡ರ;)
sopr col move
I’m not getting younger
14:37
'MY AREA!' best thing ever.
Anyone else feel that the abomisnow part is inspired by god of war 2? The squirtle abomisnow fight has the same dynamics and then the ending where wartotle decides to take on the gods is literally the ending of the game!!
I cannot wait for episode 11 man. I love this series
Fg
Man I miss Bulbasau
I like squirtles voice better
still hype, always hype
Damn a year already felt like it was yesterday 😢
When is episode 11 and episode 12?
How much progress on episode 11?
Ove01111111
Idea: when wartortle goes up to meet the gods, he finds Venasaur who escaped and found a secret tunnel up there and they work together to defeat one of the gods, and the god has a Max Revive, and charmander gets revived again
To think the story started with a bad trainer's death.
Would've been cooler if he said "everything".
12:51 what is that metweo doing hmm
https://youtu.be/-K7U26SU9cA
im your 33130 comments
Oh comeon man relase the remaining 2 episodes
Bro, when Squirtle becomes a Blastoise, he will tear shit up

What the hell happened to Charmander please have another one
Every time squirtle talks I hear chadtronic

Bro did Wartortle turn into kratos
i wanna know what happens, and who are those gods, this series is awesome, idk whyvyou stopped, but please show us the conclusion, we can't wait to see who Wartortle is gonna fight.
What happened to bulbasaur I literally forgot 💀
i cant believe the gen 1 trio is gone 😭😭😭
i really love this series, but there is just something so unsatisfying for charmander to die by the thing he hated the most. just him gone has made the series feel so unfinished. i hope he will somehow make a comeback, but i doubt it. ill watch and enjoy the next episodes none the less.
Just to awesome  make more!! I love it❤❤❤
He kinda remind me of kratos
This was back in my old times when the first video was made. And I can't wait for the 4th video content.
Definitely worth the wait
I know it wasn't easy to pull off but thank you for finishing the fight I don't know what you're going through but if you need any help message me okay
I’m so sad about charmander
A
This doesn't make any sense! He just died and that's it were the hell are we! And where's the hell is babasario😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
why did you kill charmander :(
Already a year! Damn
Part 11: Im ready 👦 Im ready 👨 Im ready 👴 ☠️
I want blastoise in the next episode
French pleas 😭
I’m a bird tweet tweet 6:10
Dude, it's been an whole year! I really wanna watch the next one
Please please please make episode 11 I mean like starter Squad so please make episode 11
Please tell me charmander comes back somehow. I need to see his redemption arc and resolution with squirtle XO
I want to see more bulbasaur
23:45 If Steven Universe be like this to his gem friends
whats the song that played before the credits?
22:20 being a admin in Roblox be like:
Why a Episode Tooks so long does he make a Episode by him self ?
“Stickle!” Had me dead 😂
Alternative Evolution:  Squirtle↓ Seatortle↓ Oceatoise↓ Stormtoise↓  Stormtoise Gigantimax
I swear the worst thing ever was seeing a fire type pokemon head on bug type 🥲🥲
Make Charmander back to life please 🥺
Actually, Chimchar was mean for a reason. I wish he was nice to Squirtle and Turtwig.
WORTH THE WAIT
I think he was almost tired he had two little bags under his eyes
my prediction is, episode 11 will come out possibly in late 2023, to anytime in 2024.
The flash of interdimensional fighting between Mewtwo and Missing No was great, though tbh I was really hoping that that was the story they'd follow with.
Wait a minute. Weren’t they supposed to see mewtwo after the caterpies? What if we see a mewtwo missingno abomination
we all miss the the starter squad
Nice
I think the last epidsode might have a charizard witch is charmanders father that has been searching for him for years and found his head with caterpie wearing it and charizard kills all the cateripies and then the glitch will come and spread over the world but all the legendaries come together and the episode is titled charizards revenge and at the end the legendarys are fighting and we see that glitch has grown and it is a war
I did the math. Starter sqaud episode 11, expected release date: January 2024
New episode here? Nope, just checking. *leaves for another six months
Can't believe this is a year old already. I've watched this series so many times and so many years can't wait for these next couple episodes
Was the giant ice dud say what the fu- before he died
IMA BIRD 😂
SQUIRTLE IS A GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn this series went form funny pokemon sketch to deep dark pokemon story
When will ep 11 be released, cause it's been a year now since ep 10 came?
I've always seen squirtle more a protagonist than charmander. And this is the reason
24:20 that song is heat
Make more Plese make more starter squad with the pokmon gods
Where can I find it subtitled in Spanish?
Bro u reference blue kratos
6:54 i feel bad for the bird😮
I want charmander
Theory: Because Squirtle/Wartortle is a level 98, I think he’ll evolve into Blastoise but he’ll get glitchy and die or turn into a egg from being over-levelled in the final episode
Wow… this series took like, a decade and its not even finished. Im so amazed at this person’s dedication
lets be honest this is better than marvel
when will episode 11 come out
I'm getting granite state vibes from this and I'm loving it can't wait for the new episode
Yea I’m not watching the rest of this
It’s been one year and still no ep 11
Squirtle goes kratos
When will episode 11 and 12 come out
Anybody notice mewtwo in squirtle memory
👎
It's NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT FUNNY  THAT CHARMANDER'S HEAD IS BEING USED AS A HAT!!!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👿👿👿👿👿👿👿💔👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
☠️👎👻👿
Are you kidding me right now!?!😨😰 Why did Charmander have to die!😣😩😫😵😟 He was my favorite!!!!!😟💔 He just wanted Squirtle back😮‍💨😤😢
I hope the next episode wartortle meets bulbasaur walking as a ivysaur
It’s all fun and game til the catarpee meets wartortle as blastoise
You know at the end of ep 9 I realized that bulbasaur didnt even try to help Charmeder. Also with Bulbasaur liking poison he probably became an alcoholic.
How the heck did squirtle beat ho-ho!?
is not starter squad but is Death Charmander of starter squad i cry bro why she create the video like this no no no poooo
This series feels like god of war
here is my bet, the next episode will be Bulbasaur s point of view after the end of the war
Squirted could have killed that caterpie if he wanted
As piggy, this started as a parody, and then became the most viewed ever pokemon serie ever. Anyways, whos waiting for part 11
make charmander come back as a ghost next to giratina on top of the mountain
I want charmander back
bruh
1 year
You cant let me like this
if charmander the best starter dont come back then this series will suck and i will unsubscribe
When is 11 goinf to come at
Falta poco 🤩
I wanted Charmander to come back because of that god he has on the mountain
Funny that those Bidoof at the start are actually the female sprite
Four more years until the next episode
I saw mewtwo!
A Wartortle with the potential of a Mega Blastoise, I like it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I’m really sad that the two fire types bit it though 😢
But what happened to charmander
Man, I miss that animation, I was just sad with Charmander's death... I don't know... The sinnoh region is so... Bad, in my opinion, only 77 pokémons, but like, okay, I love the starting squad, with or without Charmander, I'm looking forward to the last 2 episodes.
Me the whole time: 🙁
I had to watch the previous episodes BC of how long it took for this to released
-Squirtle- Wartortle just became the next kratos-
wheres the rest?.. please continue this great work
We love Big Biggy
Can you make episode 11?
what the heck! 1 year already??!?!? It feels like I watched this like a few months ago
When will the 2 episodes come  I t Really like it
this is so good. i love the back story and the flashbacks. this is beautiful.
Make more Episodes please 😊
Still waiting for the next episode unless it’s already out?
Kinda fell off at the end. Charmander’s death felt really flat
Ridiculous
“oh cool what are ya gonna ask?”   “something…”
Where the hell is charmander i dont want squirtle
22:23 22:44 22:58 WHAT THE FU-
I was in High school watching episode 1. I never would’ve thought I would come to this channel every year or 2 to randomly find a new episode uploaded. Love this series
pls bring back Charmander
When does Starter Squad 11 come out
I hope charmander gets returned after he sees the gods
bruh I got to say all this waiting for a cliffhanger I mean I like it but I wish  that we did not have to wait 2 or 3 years or 1  not a hate comment just saying. my opinion
1 year up boiii
So can we still call him Squirtle or do we just call him Wartortle now?
i hope you make more episodes
Awww charmander is killed by the caterpe slayer
How about you make a part where buddies comes back
I want Korea title  나는 한글자막을 원합니다
If Wartortle was that overpower imagine it evolving into a blastoise
Shouldn’t have killed charmander
wartortle sounds like alex jones
Who saw the Mewtwo fighting the glitched guy
How did squrtle doj the fire 🔥
I just realized something, the flareon in episode 7 never died he just left, "And don't come back until you learn to fight for yourself!" so does that mean the flareon will come back?
My heart is depressed. My childhood….My innocence….I’m with you Squirtle….
What happened to bulbasoar?
Char is a cheap copy of charmandor
it's not the same as it was when charmander was here, Its boring now
where is charmander???
So sad
What happened to Bulbasaur
I dont think charmander is dead. Mewtwo is literally known for killing missingno (or destroying him for a while) Who knows what could happen next?
Bro I love the snovers' voices 😭
Episod 11 plss
question. when Caterpie says "it's not me you've been afraid of" who does Caterpie mean? who was squirtle (wartortle now) afraid of?
And that's why you shouldn't make friends if your still struggle with PTSS and are still retraumatist
Am thinking that next episode Will be return of charmander with forgoten memory and come back have back memory And evol to charmelion
Homie turned into kratos
*Squirtle evolves into Wartortle* "One pooooooooonch!!!
What about Missingno.'s battle with Mewtwo
will charmander come back
Shippiddge u mind if u make a part in episode 11 or 12 charmanders soul is talking arceus and arceus gives charmander a second chance to get revenge on the caterpie that killed him?
Cool
When will u upload!!!!!!!!!!
GUYS WORTORTLE IS GONNA ASK SOMETHING 😱😱😱😱😱😰😰😰
there is no way this is a year old....
I have a theory that maybe episodes 11 and 12 will be a recap on what happened in gen 2 and gen 3
I want charmander back charmander is my fav character
Shippiddge I have a question when will Episode 11 and 12 come out?
''Always remember turtwig I hate you both more then you ever know'' got me laughing so hard
“oh cool what are you gonna ask?” “something.”
DO THE ANIMATIONS FASTER
Bruh these charmander fans blasting hatred even after that much screentime and here our bulba boi and turtle boi didn't got as screentime and importance in anime and they didn't even evolved they did bulba boi and turtle guy dirty in anime and venusaur is deadass always getten his ass kicked and blastoise ass whooped against Charizard but still these charmander ballsack kiddo fans wants more in an fan made series, that fire lizard even got 2 mega's
Rip charmander
Finnally
Yes the best pokemon ripped off i ever seen
Is lovely!!!! Pls episode 11 & 12
This is a whole diferentes thing
Where is 11 and 12
I hate there worm
I miss chameder
Do you think charmander is going to get a comeback as charmelon
Kratos moment
wrz cARMENDAR PLZ
I am still waiting for the next episode.. it's been a year
R.i.p Charmander 😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢😿😢
I will never understand why everyone is acting like this episode was anything other than terrible. I know Shippiddge and everyone put a tremendous amount of work into it, but to throw away EVERYTHING from the previous 9 episodes is just bad writing. Charmander's character development, the missingno plot, Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur's relationship. Just getting rid of two of the main characters and trying to sell me a whole new plot just doesn't work at all. Not buying it, sorry.
This was so cool 😭
it turned into god of war at the end
Epic.
No wonder why  nobody uses bug types
Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof Bidoof
"I'm a bird! Tweet, tweet!" 🤣 I lost it there.
What happened to Mewtwo and Missingno?
Bro yes please 🙏 🙌
Why is Squirtle Not Evolve Yeah?
I'm not gonna be surprised if Char's VA lost his/her voice after this
Why did this remind me of early God of War fight sequences 🤣🤣
you are a genius, but the sad part is squirtle never realized that all charmander wanted was to save him and not to evolve i hope we will see the original squad back together in the next episodes
Squirtle is now just not just a wartoirtle but kratos from Pokémon legends arceus
Where is bulba?
I’m just kidding 😅
Snover over here about to tell me staring directly into the sun gonna give me superpowers
I wonder if piplup is going to come and fight squirtle in episode 11
Because charmander is not going to be in this anymore
I am not going to watch this show anymore 😢
In part 12 they should do a final boss like team rocket and wartourtle which will evolve to blastoise and chamander and  bulbasaur and  will join as charizard and venusaur and pikachu and the leader caterpie will come  and they will all team up to beat team rocket
I’m still waiting for part 11
wartortle is not supposed to have the strength of the sun
um where is piplup?
Squirtle and wartortle meet in past and wartortle frees his past self from the liar caterpie that killed charmander
Myetwo is still fighting that thing
Plís gym charmander
I'm so fucking mad that there isn't a 12th video but I do have an idea of what could happen Squirtle Makes it to the top and at the top there is arcues and Squirtle makes a request were arcues says if you don't tell anyone who lives up here and what happened I will bring Back your friends Charmander and balbasor or however the hell you spell it
dis video busein bro
You did a good job. Keep up the good work. Sorry if I was impatient.
Plot for episode 11 Our hero continues to climb up the mountains to figure out who is the one on top of the mountain. Since because in the end, Warturtle said that maybe Gods can be up the mountain. In the middle of the hero's journey, Warturtle meets an old friend, Bulbasaur. This time, ever since ten years ago, Bulbasaur has evolved to his second or third form. Also, he has become less of a goofball and doesn't wear a separate head on his head. We also get some back story of how the rest of this journey was from the point of view from Bulbasaur.
i miss Charmander
What happened to bulbasaur?
Why has it took 9 years to get to episode 10
I wanted charmander back. Pls bring him 🙏🙏🙏  🥺🥺
Squirtlle became the god of war
ep 11 when
21:54 Literally a movie quote except its Starter Squad
Charmander is still alive mewtwo got his back and missing no is still out there
what charmander was my fav plus the worms were annoying
😧Not gonna lie I'm so disappointed after watching ep 10😓
Best pokemon movie ever
Will charmander  come back
I just realised, they did level 98 because he has to level up 2 times to become Blastoise
Drednaw is dumb
Why didn't Squirtle kill that bug 🐛
This video suppose to be 3 months ago, time is out of control
Why not make charmender become alive in the next video and avlove to charmeleon and charizard i wanna see it i will sub if u make
12:51 did i saw mewtwo while using speed???
I really want to now what happened nexts
I can't believe they killed charmander off. I also can't believe they just dropped the mewtwo missingno story after just one episode. I was really looking forward to see what would happen next but instead we got a main character death and a random new story out of nowhere. At first I was into it but now I can't even watch it anymore.
So... You're not doing this anymore or you Need 2 years for an episode?
Abamsnow deserved this. the fact that squirtle-excuse me, wartortle, took himself accoutable after years of sufferind is awesome. I am dieing for the rest of this series!!!
Ye i hate that worm i want charmander back
Squirtle was level 98, Wartortle is now level 99. My guess is that dialga is gonna play some kind of part. This is sinnoh. And assuming the top of the mountain is the gods...
Plot Twist: the god is bulbasaur or charmander
I’m guessing that Mewtwo will be the god in the next episode
Its just not the same  Edit: the new grass guy is kinda cool
Why wouldn’t they save him
I love it but charmader was the best
Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
God of Wartortle
This turned into god of war pokemon edition real fast
Pokemon version of kratos
2:23 Pokemon mystery dungeon be like:
if only red chose anything but squirtle
Bidoof is now a water type
BRING CHARMER BACK NOW!
WHY DID YOU KILL CHARMER WHY EDITORS WHYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!! 😢
how the fuck did this series go from silly Pokémon parody to god of war
Squirtle just failed the easiest "Who's that Pokémon" question ever.
squirtle! What did you do to him?!
o my god
wow pokimon
2022 queremos en siguiente episodio 11
14:39 man that tree really needed a T pose break
This is so cool
Me thinking squirttle was gonna say “ I’m gonna ask for my friend back
I don’t know if it’s the same voice actor playing wartortle as the one that plays Squirtle (maybe it’s a filter) but idk it might be someone different
So many jokes. This is gold!
When the next part comin out
What happens to Bulbasaur???
You can tell that the caterpie is a kid because he has 2 Pokémon called whiskers and Bluey
Make episode 11 all ready
FINALLY IS WARTORTLE TIME "WAR"
“Me unsubscribing because charmander died”
24:20
24:17
MAKE PART 11 MAKE PART 11
That squirrel betrayed charmander ....
Imagine if charmander comes back because dialga is on top of the mountain and brings them back
I thought he died. I'm so happy he's back.
4 months... what even happened to this channel and this series?
Where’s bulbasaur
Episode 11: squirtle beats the gods, and he is a true god of peace.
It's not the same as it was with charmander
Can’t believe that it’s a year old already…
Wait this was a year ago
I literally just got a  squirtle starter at the sta-
Nooooo charmander
holy shit
rip char
could you do bulbasaur's life
my little tree feelings
I suspect this will end by loading a savepoint of the original player.
Charmander is coming back right?
The squirtle of war
To everyone thinking that Charmander may have lived, look a look at 7:03 and how his head is being worn by Caterpie.
finally in ep 11 bulbasaur won't be the sitting duck!
What about charmander Can't he get revived
wpw
Maybe, Episode 11 could be called: “The ghost of Charmander”
ep 11 pls
God of war turtle
Could u make more than Episode 10 with pokemon like by continuing with war turtle and maybe having him take Charmanders body to bring him back to life and Charmander evolved?
This is the kind of Pokemon I always wanted to watch.
Where's Piplup
12:51 bloopers I think squirrel will fins the Pokémon god which is mewtwo and then kill his trainer
Where’s piplup?
I can relate to charmander
I SEE MEWTOW!!!
ITS MEWTOW!!!!!!!
Mew 2 Was in the back
2

222

Awe man, you killed off charmander.
For what it is as a standalone, this is gold. As for continuing the series, this is shit. The story built up from episodes 1-9 is just thrown out the window with this. Very disappointing.
This series has literally turned into Pokemon God of War and Wartortle is well on his way to become Pokemon Kratos.
Make a new one please i need to know everything
great we just have to wait another 3 years for chapter eleven
when will you continue are you even gonna continue
God Chimchar gets on my nerves. Turtwig I love because bias
I have to admit, at first watching this I thought this was gonna be an alt future thing where Squirtle met Dialga at the peak and got sent back to save Charmander, but now I’m not sure what the endgame is.
😡😡😡😡😡😅😅😅😅😅😅😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😅😅😅😅 you hugn mjhjj
Everyone else thought that Charmander was reborn and became Chimchar, explaining the aggressive behavior he showed in this episode.
Lmao I like How they made Chimichar The new Charmander and Turtwig the new Bulbasaur
This is epic! But charmander dying is just dark he was my favorite character
No why did Charmander have to die
Wartortle become the god of war wtf
Pls 11 episode
I would say charmander is better squirrel!!
21:26 If Steven Universe did the same thing to white Diamond
you cudduh made squirtles evolve cooler
That's sad that Charmander died😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
should have saved Charmander
bro in the last or 2nd last episode they should ask the pokemon gods to like let them travel back in time for squirtle / wartortle to like fix all the things he has ethier done or missed
2:34 SO LONG GAY BOWSER
Squirtle jumps up  Guardian: WHAT THE F Squirtle : destroys giant snow  Me : WHAT THE HOWWW
They should make Arceus  heal Charmander
Dam that dam caterpillar broke him
i think the series would be better if charmander stayed dead, true he is the main character and pretty much the best character but idk that would be too cliché and it would be like every other show
10:24 10:24 10:24
Wen are you making a new one
Charmander did deserve to die but now that I watched this video I’m not so sure…
At episode 8, mewtwo told charmander & bulbasaur to find him after they found squirtle... But charmander had died and bulbasaur simply had just forgotten about that.... But the problem also wont be fixed if all three starters (charmander, squirtle, bulbasaur) not gathered together.... So something miracle need to be happened to gather back all 3 of them and get back to cerulean cafe and meet mewtwo in the end....
His last words:"WHAT THE F-"!
☹️☹️🥺
The part with Squirtle and Spearow some people actually posted it and I actually seen it but I didn't think that was actually in the episode
Squirtle what's my name
22:58 what da f***😂😂😂
So funny but this series also is kinda dark :/
In 20:03 is my fav part squrtle just a behave Pokémon 😢😢😢
Wait but what happened to charmander and bulbazor?
I been waiting for 1 year and looking at the beginning and now here I Am VERY PROUD?!!!! ✨
Next part plz
It started because of red
True man
When will Part 11 come out
Wooow The Cure Mike Favourite Pokémon charizrand
growing up and watching this now on what Squirtle has said it hits different on a personal level fr
Turtwig is now my favorite character
the rebirth of kratos
Sooo did bubasaur die or not?
I like copying fearow
Hay Shippiddge can you make a part 11 and 12
whiskers go brrrr
Bro why the heck are you taking so long for making all the episodes >:(
More pls more
alright hear me out what if charmander never truly died and squirtle is having one of those comic futyre sights before it happens, and in ep 12 he snaps back into his senses and saves the other two starters? the turtwig and chimchar could be hid imagination of his future team members, but in reality charmander and bulbasaur are still alive while hes seeing whats happening in this episode
It’s all Squirtle‘s fault that Charmander is dead because he chose to water guns Charmander to near death instead of the Caterpie
What happened to Bulbasaur
Wtf ending is this
RIP CHARMANDER AND CHAR
There is a dragon type and a metal type
Rip charamander
I wish I could have seen charmander as a charizard.
a year goes by so quickly
Please bring back charmander in ep 11 somehow just please do it
Charizard's death was unlawful >:(
...What on earth am I watching
Damn it’s been a year already
Nooooo Charmander😢😢😢 and Blue became a Pokémon god of war instead of him
Can you upload episodes 11 and 12 for fcking sack
I miss charmander :(
Part 11??
Gotta love the snovers replacing each other
I like the starter squad.😀 I love it!!!!
make episode 20                                        pls
I don’t think there’s a starter squad anymore because Squirtle evolved and Now he’s not a starter
Bro shippiddge please have wartortle climb the mountain and remember what mewtwo said about him being in cerulian cave please dude
Catapie why did you get rid of squirrel
My god.... SO MUCH EMOTIONS
I can't believe Charmender died
Wartortle is really gonna fight arceus
I hope another episode comes because this was very good
I was expecting that Charmander evolve
Be    neks episode 11 sgaard toordool
God Of Wartortle
pls make it faster i ave ben waitin for 4mouts
Can’t Believe I saw MewTwo again.
Charmander need to survive he the main character
It been 1 year since I want to know if Charmander still alive and Charmander to evolve and Bulbasaur to return and evolve with Wartortle and Charmander
I think after ep 12 you should make a movie 🎥
Wait if 11 is coming that means it must be the war of the birds and the catarpie
Wait squirtle can bring back the ones he lost
I want episode 11 NOW!
Squirtle:RIDEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR HENSHIN!!!!!!! EVOLVED FROM RAGE KAMEN RIDER WARTORTLE
love the beavers
Okay okay I’m okay okay I just got home from work lol lol I’ll be there in a few minutes I’ll be there in a little after I get back in my
It’s like the Moral Orel of Pokemon  Started campy and silly and evolved into something we couldn’t have imagined, but this time in the best way possible
why did it take so long Jesus Christ
Red: Picks squirtle* universe: PATH CHOSEN.
I want charmander back
IS THIS THE END!!!!!! PLEAS TELL ME KNOW
Predictions on the last 2 starter squad episodes 11: We'll see how Bulbasaur is doing after the events of episode 9, and see much more of caterpie's life after charamander death 12: The show has come an end, Caterpie revives Charmander and apologizes him about how he started the the Caterpie murder and they became friends, the other members of the squad comes back together to go back together, and we'll also find out Pikachu was on their adventures all along as he was the cameraman who recorded all of their adventures and things and that was the reason why he didn’t appear. The squad evolves into their last stages and they take a picture together and it becomes a happy ending at last.
Bros been walking for a year now
oh man they decided to have that 'gurren lagann' path where the MC died and replaced by another :(
when is episode 11 coming
2:33 - So long, gay Bidoof!
Out of specifically these starters I would have chosen bulbasaur
Bruh how can squrtle fight charmander
Charmarder got killed by a green silly worm with a stick
This is better than the real series
Bring charmender back cus mew two asked him to fight this glitch that he made
I fEEl so bad for charmander
What’s sad about this is that nobody was in the right nor were they in the wrong, for starters Charmander’s actions were in the wrong but his intentions were just in the right he committed mass murder because he wanted to get friend back plus those caterpie’s were willing to kill him so he didn’t exactly have choice, speaking of Caterpie, they at first wanted to protect their people but after killing Charmander they became cocky and wanted to start a war, not realizing the consequences or rather ignored them now having to live the rest of their life with that regret, as for bulbasaur— well ignorance is bliss.
Loved the series but when can we expect the next episode it’s been about a year .
Dime dame un Pokémon Luna porque me regaló una pokebola
Where it part 11
I’m sad charmander died
Charmander needs to make a come back
What’s happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur
I can't believe a year had passed since the release of the 10th episode
I don’t believe squirtle Charmander is alive and I know it!
Wartorle’s voice hit puberty
Just realized today it’s the first year anniversary 🎉 Still waiting for new part.
[chimp char] meeting him was the worst event of my life I wish death upon him nightly
I love beavers❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazzzzzzzzzzzzing
Its been a year daddy
Idk if wartotle is gonna turn into blastoise and he can bring everyone back
Par 11 part 11 part 11
And is Literally The Tallest Mountain In The World based on Mount Everest?
did whiskers die or leave
Wait so what happened to bulbasaur after episode 9 again?
Bruh I need wait 2 years for episode 11
Episode 11's probably going to be 40 minutes to an hour long
Abomasnow is literally 4x weak to fire, what was char thinking? Probably underleveled.
It’s been a year shippiddge. I really really miss you
What happens to the squirtle eye
Are we all just gonna ignore that he became god when he evolved, makes me think what kinda power boost it would give when he becomes blastoise
oh
bruh what happpen to the dragon charmarder
What if charmander evolved into chameleon with the same godlike abilities like wartotle and runs the place
Wait what if when they get to the top its charamander's soul that's in charge 🤔
Please do another story but with Gen 2
I almost cried 🥺
I want Charmander back
😭 why he died why why 😭😭
Cool
Nice
Pt:12 now haaaaaaaaa! Way 12. Now
could someone give me the time stamp where it shows mewtwo fighing missingno
Can’t believe charmander died
The fact that snover is my favorite Pokémon and is the comedic relief to squirtle being stressed out is enjoyable to watch over and over again 🤣
I love how Bulbasaur had that naive attitude towards himself, while Turtwig here is completely satire most of the time.
Bro the way caterpie is just wearing charmanders head hits hard even after watching this 4 times
I still come back to squirtle's flashback regularly due to how much I relate to it. That melancholic feeling of it being too late is something I don't think I'll ever be able to recover from.
very late comment, amazing video but like im praying we get to see Charmander one last time.
Did anyone see mew two fight missingNo in the flash back with squirtle and the worm?
I refuse to believe Charmander actually died, especially at the hands of a weak-ass Caterpie.
I refuse to believe Charmander died. He was the main character. He has plot armor.
Time to wait another 9999999999 years
Pls more
Shame on you Squirtle for not saving your friend Charmander! For whatever reasons, Charmander did try everything to find you and you chose to watch him die.  Charmander might have been brutal but he was good. Shame on you Squirtle! Regret? Too late!
hold on……in episode 8 haunter says you turn into ghastly when you die…WHO THINKS CHARMANDER WILL BE IN THE NEXT EPISODE AS GASTLY!
Are you going to made another chapter like episode 11
forgot these existed for awhile
His name is turtwig
Hold on…In episode 8 haunted says you turn into gastly  when you die.Who thinks charmander will become a gastly in the next episode?
21:27
24:01
Squirtle had a f*** you job the f****** take care of charger dead things to him like the lizard Charizard why the f*** why the f***
Chapter 11 pleas
Wait where is Bulbasaur?
Rip char
Really hate the fact that "youll never make it past snow way" is because "theres snow in the way" and not "there SNOW way"
im really sad that carmander died😟😟😟😢😢😭😭😭
When's episode 11 gonna come out?
congrats on 1mil
“Oh cool. What are going to ask?” “……… Somthing.”
Why does Wartortle be looking like Goku rn??
All this started because charmander killed her brother
Dude. The writing is phenomenal! Oh man this was epic!!!
See what I mean when she kicks him
Char is so mean and be for societies real I don’t care if it’s not or if it is! I just want the beavers to be OK like in real life like I’m somebody’s being killed I don’t care it be us if beaver society is real or not I just wanted to be yes because Bieber societies real I don’t care if it’s not sure
I’m mad that a monkey replaced a fire breathing dragon
I miss charmander and seeing that he dies kinda sucks
When are you going to make chapter 11 it's been so long😅😭
the soundtrack at the end was so beautiful
me realising that this was uploaded nearly a year ago now.. where did all the time go
Come on dude i want chapter 11
WHEN PART 11
6:06
12:04
다음화 내놔
Can only imagine how powerful he’ll be if he evolves into Blastoise
3:29 to be fair he has a point, Squirtle lecturing Chimchar about progress, while he's wearing a rock prevents him from getting more stronger is hypocritical
My childhood he level up
Respect to big bibi
WARTORTLE SO OP
why squrtle chose caterpies team and those tree pokemon they hv a weird voice
I am a bird tweet tweet !!!!!!!!!!!! Lol 😂
12:50 Mewtwo vs Missingno
I’m gonna guess the one at the top is like arceus or something but with this series it could go any possible way lol
Hmmm now i wonder how did whiskers died?? He was like the second strongest of all the pokemon in the worms side, how?
Hahaha,  Blue shell man
This series just got so dark
I liked this series I know how long it takes for you to make I hope piplup comes soon and sandslash, bulbasaur, and the one glitched pokemon monster
What if right before caterpie stabbed Charmander mewtwo teleported and got Charmander out of there and then just replaced him with a random head after all mewtwo did say Charmander was gonna take care of this mess the mess being MissingNo
Did he ask them something yet?
When’s the next one
Where is episode 11
So it started with a video of the starter pokemons perspective on who gets picked.. And now it's at God of Wartortle?
24:15 bro this gave me goosebumps
I wish that's there's just a twist that charmender is still alive like another dream story lol love your story and animation
Anyone else find it fking terrifying that  Abomasnow is giant and weird looking. Also wonder what happened to the Piplup… oh wait it got picked as a starter nvm
He went from a soldier to a war veteran
Hi
What happened to bulbasaur?
Wartortle sounds like Christian bale as Batman
Your almost 1 m
23:48 Wartortle terastalizes! Shippiddge has predicted terastalization!  This is probably the best episode of Starter Squad so far. I like the other ones to but after everything happened this one is incredible. It’s so cool that Squirtle went outside of Kanto but I wonder how he got there. What did he go through on the way there? Why did he go to Sinnoh before deciding to climb Mount Coronet? Maybe he’ll explain in the future. Way to go, Shippiddge!
I hope. By some small miracle. Charmander returns.
I cant be the only one who checks for ep11 every single day💀
pokemon  baguheban
I bet charmander survived because of plot,just guessing
Why do I still feel like charmander is still alive I mean he was a fan favourite and it would be such a epic entrance if he just came out of nowhere and save Squirtle last second and say “did you really think I could die?”
10 months? time really flies i remember screaming when i saw this in my youtube feed, and episode 9 was 2 years ago? crazy. i remember it all like yesterday and i’m super hyped for episode 11!
Just mad he killed off charmander
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pokemon at bloons td 6 be like
MAKE ANOTHER PART PLS I LOVED IT
Poor bulba
Dude i want charizard man not the monke
I cant believe I rooted for a race-annihilating lizard than an underdog worm.  Charmander better come back. We miss his foul mouth.
When will episode 11 come?
When you realize that charmander was technically in the right and if squirtle didn’t betray him he would still be alive and would have a closer relationship with them both 🤦🏿‍♂️
$100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000❤Luis
Was that Mewtwo in 12:50?
It’s been 10 months
R.I.P charmander you will be missed
Turtwig is charmander s voice they used him all over again
Squirtle has been through more than you think he already knows where and this is going if they continue on having a war with the bioofs
The fact squertle is the only one alive from charmender and bulbasoar the caterpillar is the one who killed charmender they feed on bulbasoars  plant it has what they need inside
a cool note how they gave squirtle the EXACT LEVELS HE NEEDED TO EVOLVE INTO BLASTOISE. especially now that hes a level 99 wartortle.
Let’s stop predicting and get episodes 11
진짜 재미있네요ㅋㅋㅋ
Dialga up there, huh? Master of time? I wonder... XD
18:35 if you want to see the fight
Make a chapter 2
Does turtwig survive? (He’s my favorite Pokémon)
14:15 chimchar hasnt evolved yet and he doesnt have a everstone??? So how would he have reached a high lvl to use an attack that looks like flame thrower the best attack he’d have is ember? So that cant be chimchar🤨🤨🤨
This episode make me cry
And all started when the only attack he knew was bubble
Nooooo not Charmander
I wonder if we are going to get turtwig back some how
아니 가벼운 마음으로 보기 시작했는데 왜 쓸데없이 명작인데 이거 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
6:06 ad just at this moment
AHHHAHAHAHAHAHA want more
I wish charmander never died. Can u plz make Celibi go back to the past and make charmander kill the annoying worm
WHERE THE FUCK IS CHARMANDER
Squirtle is a badass
The Caterpie with Charmander head is making me sad and also mad so can you please make Charmander come back?
I've been seeing this passes on my feeds and I decided to watch it from the start, and guess what, I'm shocked that Charmander ended up being a hat💔
OMG charmander is dead
woww i love this series from ep 1 to 10 i loved the amount of laughs
One thing I love about this is unlike SMG4's YouTube Arc, they actually chose a unique and unexpected direction for the series. And unlike how SMG4 won't kill off his orange money maker, this series does.
when someone asks me what Character development is ill show them this series.
DELETE THIS EP AND MAKE ANOTHER ONE IN WHICH CHARMENDER IS ALIVEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I WILL END YOU LIFE BRING CHARMENDER BACKKKK
It sucks that we lost charmander
and now squirtle sounds like muscle man
Why did you have to make Charmander die I was hoping Squirtle was gonna save Charmander I didn’t want him to die😭
This  remember me FlexAir, an last bad update of a masterpiece serie. xd
Fr charmender better
It’s sad that Charmander die
Where is Charmander
Animal themed anarchist.. were I have I seen this before😑
When are u gonna make a new one
Did I  just u
Bruh the darkest anime i ever seen Why U chose to killed charmennder it's soo crushed
Heyyy are you having a flash back let me ask him
When starter squad episode 11 coming out
파이리가 죽는게 어디써요...
Make the videos of these Pokémon! Make sure the caterpillars die!!!
Make more videos
Hi
Actually as bulbasaur fan I want him back we know the sad ones charmender is dead but where abouts of bulbasaur is unknown  Please bring him back 😳😳  Though turtwig is good I can't imagine him in place of bulbasaur  Also please show the true potential and power of bulbasaur please
I FUCKING LOVE THE "You can tell because there are X's where it's eyes are supposed to be"
So, this is what my brother was up too
When's ep 11 and 12
starter squad episode 11 charmander ???
It's not the same without charmander, I'm disappointed.
The tree guy sounds like the "Vreedles" from Ben 10
What happened to mewtwo
Why does the animation looked like it changed
Squirtle is the best starter
Pokemon    Pikachu card
Sddd
2:35 And I thought only team rocket blasted off like that
this dude is not messing around
Where is Bulbasaur.....?
WTF THE WORST EP I HAVE EVER SEEN WHERE IS CHARMANDER WOW IM CRYING RLY NOW I WAITED ALMOST 2 YEARS FOR THAT
Omg, image Wartortle goes up against the gods, and he goes PASSED level 100?! 😱 I need to see that!!
Charmander now looks like a monke:>
What if the king at the top is. Charmander like he really didn’t die like he escaped
Im kinda glad chimchar is dead
So squirtle met another plant and fire type?
Thanks you for making the new episode I’ve been waiting for along time🙏
Plsssss
We want him back pls
Were the hell is balbasuor
i am and was completely stunned with the direction of this episode. WOW!!!! Very dark but also a lot of well written and acted out content. I wonder if after the last two episodes will Shippiddge do a gen 2 or spin-off.
Where is episode 11
Why is nobody talking about mewtwo fighting the glitche
His wartotle form already turned him into gigachad, imagine if he turned to blastoise
Part 11
It's amazing how a squirrel who was so weak evolved like this and became strong like this.
Blue shell guy lol
Yay time to wait another *868 YEARS FOR THE NEXT EPISODE.*
The gods final words were WHAT THE FU-
I want charmander back
Yo where’s piplup?
'fraid i lost mad respect for this show to find out charmander died.
SEE YA IN 10 YEARA
IT'S BEEN 10 MONTHS BRO WHERE IS IT??!??!?!? UR TAKING MORE TIME THAN ONE PUNCH MAN NEXT SEASON
Even after he's confronted his past,  i still feel like when wartortle is talking to chimchar, he's somewhat speaking to charmander. "If you had evolved, you would have given them hell."
Where's the other 2 episodes
Noooo... Theres no way my fav character really died (Charmander)
Realizing that he was wearing Charmander’s head I actually felt like I was dying I really wish that he didn’t die because there might’ve been an opportunity for him to really grow and evolve and become a better person… I mean Pokémon
goofy ah animation
WHAT HAPPENED TO  BULBASAUR HE DIDNT DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE AND IF HE DID YOUR NEXT!
🤣
now i know what it feels to force yourself to watch after they kill ur fav character
I swear that charmander should come back
Time Travel! I predict Time Travel…Or a resurrection potion or ritual! ⏱🧟‍♂️
oh my lovely chamender was die.... I hate cat
I feel bad for Charmander
20:05 where is *hatmander* ?
Hey I've got an idea for episode 12 when Wartortle/Blastoise defeated arceus Wartortle/Blastoise has been granted 1 wish and Wartortle/Blastoise wished for charmander to come back to life, for season 2 ep 1 Wartortle/Blastoise trained charmander to evolve into Charmeleon Idk what else to think of putting in this episodes ideas ik u will not understand what I'm comment
When the part 11 release ?
Si charmander vuelve en forma de charizard mega evolucionado y se venga de squirtle sería epico
WHERE IS PART 11
Wow 😳...just WOW 😍🖤❤️
great work :) very entertaining stuff <3
When is 11 come out please I want all them :(
Love the evolution music
I am loosing my mind this is incredible
What ever happened to Bulbasaur?
Charmander deserved to die 😆
damn I really wanted charmander to live
Still passed at Squirtle because of Charmanders death but I’m glad he learned his lesson
wait did charmander really died
I am exited to see the next episode!
Wtf is wartortles voice-
If that trainer caterpie doesn't die in the last episode I'm gonna explode
why tf did you kill charmander
Shoulda gave squirtle a Barry White voice cuz he's pretty hard on the ears atm.
I waited  the hole year, good!
pls do pt 12 plsssssss
I started watching episode 1 because of nostalgia and now I’m here. This is great.
Can you make a part 4?
I think that whiskers will fight squirtle
Sounds like piccolo was good wish it was longer 🥺
Wow I didn’t know if it was on in oct last year I just check this profile today and I guess I only had it subscription thing on this account I don’t use often
Just wanted to say that I love you guys' video it's really well done and it's hella funny
I love how dynamaxed/Abomasnow Just said WHAT THE FU- In his death
안돼...... 파이리  NO
LVL 98!wtf
Anyone else notice Mewtwo is still fighting that Hitmonlee🤣🤣🤣
Oh boy only 18 more months until episode 11!  Please be only 18 months
I WOULD KILL THAT CATERPIE BY NOW I GIVE NO MERCY TO THEM
Tbh this never would have started if red chose charmander
Aruseusu? How foolish, everyone know it's name is Arkoos
you have 2 episodes left, if charmander isnt alive or back, ill have the same fate as him.
A NEW EPISODEEEE
This is so ridiculously higher quality than it has any right to be what the hell
charmander better come back to life
Can I know when the ep 11 will be available?
Charmander must have lived because he was in "three episodes left" Edit: this was me in the past dont waste your time on a reply
"You believe in me? You believe in me!? After enslaving me, lying to me, for forcing my every move!?? It turns out you believe in me?? Oh that's that's great!!! I'm so happy I'm strong enough for you!! Thanks for believing me!!!!" After watching this whole series  up to this episode, I felt every word that came out of squirtle's mouth.
Anyone notice the glimpse pop up of mewtwo fighting missingno @ 12:50?
This is s epic pls make 11 12 13
This is really "something" !!!!!
mane i miss bulbasaur, bro was the most valid
When well you make 11
Chimchar is fighting gods
Me waiting for Charamder coming back
Turtwig
tree dude: oh cool what are you gonna ask? wartortle: somthing DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
Squirtle: Sorry Charmander, I don't know when I'll see you again but it might not be for a while... *Proceeds to see charmander's severed head every single day for a long time** 😭
Such a brilliant and shocking turn of events🥺🥺🥺
Y’know… they spent 10 more minutes on squirtle which I think just made 99% of the viewers yearn for charmander back
I would pick Squirtle cuz I love him in like the pixel version of Pokemon I have a flag of him
see you guys in one year
Well most of us *Chosen* Squirtle as starters. He have the every right to be one of the best Pokemon after 30 years franchise..good to know it says to be continued. I hope squirtle got to travel back time
See you guys in 2027 when epidode 11 drops😀
I’d always wondered why this had taken so long, after seeing so many tiny clips the real episode is even better than I thought. I can’t wait to see what happens next!
time to wait for about 15 years see y'all than
Imagine Charmander Meeting the Snovers
I still think charmander is returning somehow, dead or alive
MAKE! THEM!! FASTER!!!!!!!!
You are the best Pokemon YouTuber in my opinion
파이리가 주인공이었는데 시신됬누
fire monke
Sorry. Really bold decision to get rid of Charmander, but it leaves a big dent in this episode. Really not sure if its going to be as entertaining going forward but this episode doesnt really cut it
I knew squirtle would evolve some episode
I dont like this episode. The series revolved around Charmander and suddenly switching the focus to Squirtle doesnt really make a whole lot of sense to me. It also isnt very good IMO. I really miss Charmander and in my eyes the series ended at Episode 9. If Charmander returns as Ghastly, forget about this comment.
9 whole month still nothing I will update each month
I wonder if we'll see whiskers again
This twist and weight generated by the squirtle, having an unexpected and sad ending, reminded me a lot of the ninja turtles comic "the last Ronin" where all the ninja turtles died and only one left, which now has to deal with the weight of one guilt that consumes him for having lost his friends, leaving only revenge, and to console himself, obtaining a disciple who gives him hope.
12:51 Hello Mewtwo & mysterious DNA how r u doing?
Charmander had a lot of screen time to just die out without a word! Did not like that part! I wont say this part is bad unless i see the next part because it could be a start to a good end!
I can’t wait for part 11 wartortle will see Dialga, Palkia And Arceus
i love replaying up to 24:08 till the end its so good!
When will next one comes out  Episodes 11
fff
Who was mentwo fighting at around 12:50
Wow it takes him 2 years to make 1 episode dahm
It’s ironic that warturtle is crashing heaven to save the one based on sun wukong
dude, I’m so happy this came out
I didn't even notice u made this but keep up the content
Please make 11
episode 11 is in 47 years
Charmander dead if I see a worm I'll kill it for Charmander because I love Charmander 😈🤜🪱🐛
I never thought 2 Snovers would make me crack up so much
I have a different theroy squrtle is going to go back in time and save every one first by going to to end of episode 9 to save charmander and everyone else
Don't let this series end, ultra instinct wartortle
What happened to Piplup..?
can you do ep 11 pls
I can’t believe Charmander is actually dead :(
I love how the phrase: “you got a lot of nerve” has been repeated consistently throughout this series over and over
you c0uld kill tree man with a rattatata  with it holding choice scarf endeavour and quick attack
The fact Squirtle is at sinnoh and not Johto makes me think he got the other starters killed.
wait charmander actually died???
You had to kill Charmander now you just ruined it and I'm not watching again
i'm still mad about charmander's death
This episode hits too hard
There's gonna be a ep 11 just gonna wait couple of years
21:57 The most badass moment in the episode. Just phenomenal
Hello can you people help me what is the music when wortortle is climbing up spear piller with chimchar on his back?
Why is no one talking about the snovers. They were great
YES FINNALY
is there gunna be another episode pls make a new on eit been a year
I feel that somebody is gonna get resurrected next episode
Wow, two fire type starters die back to back.
Leader caterpie is very regret at his mistake because of his obsession just becoming strong with the help of squirtle and whiskers to kill the Pokemon who he hated at the last flashback it shows that whiskers and charmender head is not with him 'case he lost both of them in a furious and big battle or whiskers abounded him'.
What ever happened to that Mewtwo
I bet the MissingNo will come back In some way since Charmander died he was never able to find MewTwo again and fix his mistake and we all know Bulbasaur didn’t tell Squritle about it. So if he does save Charmender maybe that’s what they’ll have to do
14:37 Ah, turtwig was right 14:40 Why was a third tree following them and just T-posed for no reason on the summit of the hill?
R.I.P charmander
Charmander was My favorite one
Make the starter squad faster
Of all things Palkia and Dialga selected abomasnow who has like a 4x weakness to fire really
This series was amazing up until this fucking episode
How did squirtle go to Sinnoh?
I know this is is probably not going to happen but I think it would be so cool if "blue shell man guy" defeated arceus and asked him to revive charmander
I fucking hate the caterpie
Nnoooooooo the Bidoof did nothing :(
How has Nintendo never have taken down any of these videos?
I know, this is stupid kid action to think about... sort of sudden plot twist, when Charmander and Chimchar get revived, but what can I do with it? Maybe Squirtle/Wartortle will make "Pokemon Gods" to rewrite the history....
Pokémon: God of War Version
we want charmander bad PLZZZZZZZ
fuckin squirtel cheat charmander
#Bidoofisgod
No! Charmader's dead!
Squirtle called chimchar "char"
I know what happened to nidorina she left the caterpillar because of his obsession to continuously kill the people who he hate.
Squirtle used siesmic toss 2:31
What a name legend of a blue shell guy means reference starter squad squirtle
If volving had this huge of a power boost then it I wonder what will happen if the most chaotic of the three gets to evolve lmao.
This is really bad episode Charmander is gone and isn’t coming back I don’t know why you got rid of Charmander and also why did you add a new Group
the ever stoone diddnt do any thing
I know it'll still be like a whole other 2 or 3 years, but I can't WAIT for the release for Starter Squad Ep 11!
I want char back from the dead and have been evolved and I  can animate I just need time
I Want Charmander Back😰
PLEASE BRING BACK CHARMANDER, maybe like say Arceus looked dow down upon him and gave him a second chance or something
16:09 "Aruseusu" is the literal Japanese translation name of Arceus
It's hinted at pretty early that Squirtle isn't wearing the Everstone just for high power moves.  Turtwig mentions he's a Lv 98.  Squirtle learns Hydro Pump at lv 33, and it's final move Skull Bash at lv 36...
Can you make episode 11 slowbro
I hate the ending
the moral of the story kids is: don’t be a fire type or you will D I E
Chi char is such a Karen lol 😆
I can’t believe they cut charmander off like that
bru they killed my favorite character
Fun Fact: That fearow was a bird ;)
Bro this is sick
Never felt that similar with a character before... Squirtle just following orders, no feelings, no remorse, no frienship
Hey Ship, was the decision to have Squirtle at level 98 for this episode a very specific one?
Dam that had a lot life lessons in it
This make have some DOOM SLAYER vibe and god of war
Yeah ain't gunna miss chimchar
Shoutout to the Snovers keeping the comic relief in this episode, they’re so silly and cute and I love them oml 💖
Please give ep 11
man. the 10 years later was unexpected... i was thinking that mewtwo problem was an imediate emergency XD
Hopefully charmander returns as a ghost in the future
WTF NO ONE TOLD ME THIS CAME OUT
I can't believe charmander actually died!!!
ihvantchormandertuiwolweoldevaituCHorsord
Plot twist, at the top of the mountain they find Charmander and Bulbasaur fully evolved and say they planed to fake charmander death.
the first episode came our when I was 5💀
You've been bested in combat lmao
I love that squirtle is basically the ultimate form of malicious compliance
"Green boots" Oh no *awkward laugh*
Where is Episode 12AND13
I feel like Mewtwo and the glitch will come back 12:51
I really appreciate the animation in the snow part in all parts but especially the snow part like when they walk in the snow and It looks like Squirtle has been in a war
I feel like this is how this series feels like And the owl house and amphibian feels like 8:20
How technoblade act in the dream SMP 0:59
What the?! How’d I not find out about episode 10 till now! Been wondering when the next episode/episodes were coming out lol
When I saw squirtle with tirtwig & chimpchar I thought he was training them & helping them so that they dont end up like him, a way of trying to take a tone for his past actions by making sure it dosent happen to anyone else, but at 11:00 tirtwig exposed the truth, he isnt trying to help, hes trying to relive his youth by using some random kids that fit his old friends as if it's still before charmander was killed, heck he never bothered with tirtwigs name but with chimpchar it was worse, he was never calling him a nick name, he was calling him char(mander), hes right, the only one who got a happy ending was bulbasaur
😆😡😡!!!  Yes, there you go.
Can't wait for the next episode in the next decade
Bro Squirtle literally just became Doom Slayer of the Pokemon world, that’s so raw.
The absolute perfect way to express hatred for what is happening, total apathy
the pokemon god are probably gonna be dark rai and arceus
Time to wait another 2 year for the next episode
I'm just glad to hear your voice again as Charmander XD
wutt?! 8 months already??
I'm new don't ask but where's bulbasaur
I feel like they gonna have to go back in time with dialga so they can stop charmander from making missingno
Piplup is bawling its eyes out right now
It’d be cool if the top was nothing but on the other side is some place Charmander is in fight his own battle to get up the mountain, and both meet evolved not knowing who each other were, it’s just a concept I have :>
Make pwrt 9
Is so s3
Poor charmander
I've noticed that they've touched alot of things that looked fake after ep 8
Can you make 11 already
If your making more I’ll be so excited for them
Bruh
I feel bad for the bidoofs at the start
Hell yeah! Stater Squad is back baby! Also 12:48 glad this plot thread wasn't dropped!
ITS BEEN 2 YEARS WHERE DID HE GO? also DO WE GOTTA WAIT 2 MORE YEAR FOR THE NEXT
Anyone know what the Beginning ost is?
Bro please make more videos
Charmaine no
Please make an 11th episode
What happens next
NOOOOO CHARMANDER DIED NOOOOOOOOOOO
This is probably the best Pokémon series in my opinion
All I want is charmander to come back and maybe bulbasaur too
No it would’ve been so cool if he evolve into Charizard
BRING BACK CHARMANDR
Why piplup is not there
Whay did charmånder die:(
Make more ep pls
I wonder who will replace Chimchar now that shes ded.
Has anyone noticed that chimchar is charmanders voice
Snow last words: WHAT THE FUC-
Now we just all have to wait another ten years for episode 11
are you gonna make a part 11
I thought this thing was over but for 8 months there’s been another episode?
Yes
This Is dumb
Wow
Pleas episod 11
who else here is waiting for episode 11?
Good for you and I like you videos
You're almost at 1,000,000 You're almost at 1,000,000 subscribers
GIVE US EPISODE 11
This whole series is such brilliant storytelling.  I'm really looking forward to the next one!
squirtle always had opportunity to do with his life but he never really took those choices by himself and even though when he makes choices and they go bad he blames other people for those choices even though at first Charmander did keep him around like a trainer would do when he finally learns empathy Squirtle did stay with him as a friend even though he consider to leave he didn't do it out of freedom but just try to stick the rules just trying to be a pokemon to someone else to Squirtle following the rules is basically what a pokemon is to him but that he finally realized he needs to take responsibility for the choices he made
I don't like this now cuz Charmander died
Wartorte is about to square up against arceus, in like 6 years
At first i thought it was just gonna be a normal and funny parody but this got me watching it everyday until the next video
I thought this would never come out
Why did you make it so sad 😭
I wang charmander back in the sierra
This Is Why Blastoise Is The Best
rip charmander
Oh he left charmander and bullbasaure (idk how to tipe bullba)
Man i wish he evolved to blastoise
My life is good again
i wish charmander would survive in the entire series
Why do the Snover sound like Mr Goldenfold from Rick and Morty 😭
What happened to the humans in that world maybe the pokemon killed them.
What's the music at 24:19
wait mewtwo vs missingno
"You can tell because there are X's where his eyes should be" had me dead
nah this show doesnt feel the same without charmander i hope he gets revived or something especially with that whole thing about meeting mewtwo at cerulian cave
Great animation but squirtle is a level 98 but he evolved 1 time into a wartortle not 2 times into a blastoise
Make more
Upload a new video of this pls I like these animations pls
In the next episode charmander will become charmeleon on caterpie
i watched all the episodes today i love it pls make the 2 rest
i feel bad for charmander i mean the caterpie cut off his head man i mean he did that for bulbasaur but STILL 😭😭
im so excited for ep 11 this is so cool
Imagine if the next episode is like screw this one and this was actually a false reality and Charmander appears alive
Part 11 for 1m followers
Squirrel is now WaR tUrTlE
omg yes its been like 2yrs since this was updated
Everyone thought Charmander was gonna  elvove And survive and then he dies me:💀
Where's episode 11
Actually to be totally honest… how are the poke balls that small??? XD
What would happen if charmander didn’t die and before caterpie put a stick into charmander, charmander evolved?
And this is why Squirtle is my favorite Kanto starter! 😂
when does the next episode come out?
I want to see more!!!
I just finished the whole series thanks to fb recomms.  - Now I must suffer and wait another 2 years until the next episode is uploaded.  - Thanks for the effort making this series, Shippiddge.  Got yo self another subscriber ^^
Can you put Arceus in One  of the last episodes
Charmander Is dead all because of Sandslash
Can't say this is what I was expecting, but it looks promising anyway
Took a slowbro amount of time
Pls I want charmander back his is a good character
"I COULDVE HANDLED IT MYSELF!"  Charmander: *well that didn't work out for me...*
just something were pilpplup
its soooo good we need moreeeee
Charmander is replaced by chimchar NOW!! Really shippidge you should make charmander live and now im gonna miss him in the SERIES but I hope they will miss him I did miss him but sorry for the hate mail on this way
I really want to know when the next one comes out
Squirtle just got mad PTSD 💀
Rip charmander
i need ep 11 its a shame charmander died he had so much potential but squirtle beating something sent by gods is amazing
The  end?
Man I miss Charmander, especially after everything he went through to get Squirtle back
When will ep11 come
2022?
I’m pretty sure I was seeing a legendary Pokémon fighting a glitching pokemon
This all is so  cool and this will be the best Pokemon show everyone. And the animators are the best and all of the other people who worked on this show . I can't wait for the finale.btw I'm a kid
Obmnasnow is a push over in gameplay, due to its several type weaknesses, a fire type like chimchar would wipe the floor with it. But when you put a plain water type squirtle against it, yeah, that thing is definitely scary
Bruh hurry with the chapters just saying
It’s been 8 months daddy…..I’m still waiting
I can’t wait till catperpi dies
I started this series as a second grader in 2014, I swear ima graduate high school before this ends lol
This is like the 5th or 6th time I’ve watch the whole series and its just amazing every time. I hope you guys are doing a follow up or something new. Starter squad is just so good. Thanks for this.
Come on we've been waiting for a long time
Would you see two parts left I'm done waiting

Anyone saw mewtow at the place where Leonard die
Trader
Sqirtle  sucks
Please upload 11 part fastly
Squirtle has gone through to much in his life it’s just sad what happened to him back then
The worm killed Charmander and the worm is the woring Charmander‘s head on her head
Boo I like chearsard
Funny Theory after a Year of thinking: Starter Squad is basically a Altered Timeline that was screwed up because of Red choosing Squirtle which messes up this Timeline they’re Living in and Time Traveling using Dialga and Arceus May screw the Original Timeline of Reds Right or Correct Decisions since there may be 2 Versions of Squirtle, one from the screwed up Timeline and the other from the Right one. And the original one would basically be either Bulbasaur or Charmander to be picked by Red. Funny huh? Oh okay it’s not, I’m sorry-
Is this supposed to be charmander in another life? Because if it is I liked charmander As he was🙁
Dude where is Charmander he's better than squirtle bruh that fucking worm shit again😡
IM WAITING FOR NEW ONE I WILL WAIT

How long until the next video comes out I have been waiting for several months😕😕😕
"What are ya gonna ask?" "Something." *ROCK MUSIC INTENSIFIES*
His last line being "something in a badass tone is just the chef's kiss to the whole video
I was wondering when they'd evolve but now squirtle has an everstone
"Defeated to death because there are Xs for his eyes" hahahahaha breaking the fourth wall there
they have had  8 frikin years to do this series and its not even done yet
Man charmender died befor seeing mew damn

That poor bird thing
I Love how this is the Perfect Balance Of Sad, Epic, and Funny. All things balanced.. As they should be.
Make more
Piz
I really taught Charmander will still alive and bacame Charmeleon   I will miss Charmander
Why did charmander die man he was the best fr
we will see you at the next episode among 2 other pandemics!
Holy carp this was one of the most amazing animations ive ever seen. Its an emotionsl roller coaster, from squirtle being the chosen starter, to him becoming a slave, going against what charmander had told squirtle long ago. This turned from a humourous little animation, to death, horror and slavoury. In my opinion, this series so far is a 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
I Wana him as Blastoise shits about to pop off
Did Charmander die?
*Chimchar like me.*
😈😈😈
So turtle has PTSD?
It made me sad to see Charmanders severed head in Caterpie. He was my favorite
But one thing still confuses me. What about mewtwo aren’t we going to see it again in another episode?
This remind me of gta 5 ending where you kil micheal compare these endings side by side Franklin kills micheal  and squirtile kills charmander  Franklin kinda regrets doing it and squirtle regrets killing charmander
Squirrel sucks!  His arc sucks.  He killed or smothered all of his friends.
When does esp. 11 come online? its been a while since this one has uploaded and i cant wait for 11 and 12!
Why charmender have to die
..Damn, I return to this series years later, after I get back into Pokémon, and this hit hard
Wow.  Things just got pretty fucking _METAL._
Make a new video you son of a bitch
Please finish the series
How u gonna kill of charmander like that?
Only one entity can bring charmander back from the dead and his name is arceus
Can we all just appreciate the fact that when Squirtle finally decided to hold himself accountable for his own actions and fight for himself he became war-tortle . Fuckin beautiful
This has 1/3x views of the first episode while having 10x the content  Damn…
so... kratos time?
I'm so confused on how charmander died to a shiv when caterpie doesn't even have arms to pick it up to stab him
Is taking sooooooooooooo long to make starter squad 11
It’d be crazy if charmander came back but as charmeleon with mewtwo
I feel sad for mewtwo waiting for charmander, in cerulean cave
Make another one please I hope you make be like in a timeline also that's what I think see
FINALLY YOU DID EPISODE 10 I WAITED FOR 2 OR 1 YEAR
If your a lawyer for Pokémon reading this, please. Just let him finish the season
Were charmander
Omg rip old starters
why charmander died
Was I the only one who saw mewtwo?
So did she actually kill charmander???????!!!!!
There should be dialga  at the top and squirtle should ask to go back in time and save charmander
CHIMPCHAR KILLED MAH BOI NOCTOWL !?!?!?
Can you try and get charmander back plsssssssss
Ok but now i wander what happened to charmander
This is a horrible episode it was 28 minutes of characters I don’t care about, and we find out charmander is dead. If charmander is not brought back by squirtle by going to the top of the mountain, the will have a horrible ending.
plest berig charmader and berg the trreos back
Yo i miss  charmander
I have been waiting for so long are you just being mean you jerk make them faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster faster

He turned in to kratos from the god of war games

Idgaf about these people, Why did they kill charmander.
Another 5 years let's source this guy 😂
ep11
Did anyone notice that when squirtle was with charmander squirtle was always mad at charmander but now he doesn’t with chimchar even though chimchar is yelling at him
Weak. Squirtle n Bulbasaur sum bitches
I need 11!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mewtwo or mew probably
Make more vids PLEASE I wanna see what happens next with charmander
Part 11 please🥺
This was good as fuck bc
das
Dude, I only found out this existed now (well I guess 28 minutes ago) and it really hit hard finding out charmander was properly dead. To bring him back alive would be terrible writing, but it really sucks that he won’t come back.
bruh why kill charmander
ep 11 pls
The flashbacks are just too sad
Oh dang, I didn’t realize a new episode came out… almost eight months later. Whoops
Wait so who is chim char?
I hate that caterpie and he should have a bad ending ! Eventhough charmander started out violently ultimately he had some character development and finally he did what he have to save his friends ! Unlike this caterpie who started a war and even ordered to kill his own kind ! That Caterpie is the real evil .
This series has been amazing Loll Please make part 11!!
blue charmander🌶
howw did it take me so long to notice this ive been waiting
More Pokémon Videos

I hope in ep 11 chamander comes back and char for his wish to the pokemon gods,seen as hes been through hell in all ways I hope his friends come back.

If Squirtle didn't put on his everstone back on after he evolved into Wartortle and he's level 98, shouldn't he have also evolved into Blastoise?
EEVEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish charmander Didnt die he was my chlid hood I can’t believe squrirtle didn’t save charmander they would’ve become a trio
Make new episode's faster
Can u bring Charmander back
I can't believe this was 7 months ago
When is the nexts episode
I just recently discovered these videos, this is awesome af
It's not nice with charerzad not here
Sheesh! That Chimchar is a sick jerk! I HATE his attitude. 😠  (Edited) But I REALLY love this voice actor for Chimchar. Infact, this is a straight up better Voice of Chimchar then the official one in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness!
I miss bulbesaur and charmander
Bro became the kratos of pokemon
I've missed this series
MAN- This series evolved so much.. It give me such nostalgia watching it now after so long <33
Ahh danm I really wish the people who made this would make charmander catch the stick before he was gonna get stabbed and tell squirrel that he wasn’t going for the evolution and was going for squitel
Omg. So, SO, soooo good!
THIS TURD SO FAST AND IM GLAD I WAIT YEARS FOR THIS :)
Dude what happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur
Bro bring charmander back that was funny…
IS CHARMANDER DEAD
wait squirttles a level 98
i miss charmander🥲
i really hope this doesn't get canceled for no reason or anything. I wonder when 11 will come out
finally squirtle evoived
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😤
I want Charmander to be Charmander again :(
Oh I miss Charmander I wish you could still fight them
what happened to charmander? did he die?
Pls make episode 11
Wait where was charmander is he dead
So my theory is that mewtwo would be able to bring Charmander back by going back in time and saving him. I don’t know how it would work out but that’s just a theory.
Ima i big fan since i was kid...i know its hard to render it and it takes so much time....thank for ur efforts dude....make it happen again...awesome work....
I support you. You will achieve one million subs
New vido
This episode was so good, it almost made me cry. This is 28 minutes of good storytelling, good acting and extremely dramatic scenes, this is a masterpiece how do you and your team do this?
Why man
17:58 the monsters eyes are light bulbs that opened
Is charmander really gone forever? :(
8 years ago I fell in love with the charmander's attitude  and his improvised acts of cruelty. I was so excited to see this new episode but they've replaced literally every character in the series we've grown and loved within just this 10th episode. I can tell they put so much work into this and it looks amazing; the new story is just madly disappointing to me personally. Thanks to the creator though for the hard work & for all the years of moments of glee this series has given me.
Plz bring part 11 fast
when did ble shell man get so much strengt????
what wartortle dosent know is that arceus is on top of that mountain...
This is cool as fuck ! I want more haha
When comes ep. 11 and 12?
the tree pokemon is having a flashback about a flashback maybe that flashback is about him having another flashback and it goes on...
Tree:Okay so what are you going to ask them  Squirtle:Something Me:Bruh
16:05 what does the giant tree say (I'm assuming it was in Japanese)?
When are more coming out
please can you make Charmander😢😭😭
I cryd when charmander died
I hate that worm (because charmender)😡😡😡
If only Charmander will evolve all the way to Charizard and went full godzilla mode on caterpie and destroyed the caterpie base and made the lead caterpie suffer to the end of its thoughts and regretted having to even face him in the first place! :)
12:52
12:51
June 7, 2022 When will the new episode come out? Thanks, avid fan here 😘
Where eps 11
Just want charmender back
These stupid bugs
When is episode 11 and 12 coming out
Sqiurtle not killing Caterpie is ultimate blue balls.
Eight years later and I’m kind of surprised
Hey can you guys part 11 please me and my cousin is dying to know what is happening we want to see real turtle make it up to the Gods frites Elise part 11 I subscribe to your videos
What happens to Bulbasaur WHY IS NO  asking this!!!!! I need answers!!!
Charmander will come back right??? He can’t be dead right????
We want the ep 11 fast i just cant wait
I love how squirtle just so long gay bowsered the bidoof
SHIPPIDGE WHERE ARE U IF U ARE THERE WHEN IS STARTER SQUAD 11 COMING
Pt11 plz make it hurry
Squirtle looks so depressed
TikTok brought me here. Specifically, because of the Rock Smasher bit(if only Pokemon games had real-time combat, then Geodude would actually throw hands like that).  Checked the whole series up to now. Sucks that the remaining 2 episodes will take years to make.   And hopefully Nintendo doesnt mess with this. But Im guessing they tried many times.
When will starter squad 11 come out?
i feel like ep 11 is squirtle askin the gods to give charmander back...
I want the next one nowww
Can't wait for the next episode. Hopefully soon
8 years for the next is charmander alive
Finally
The next episode please
THIS IS SO GOOD BUT SQUIRTEL if I'm not spell right I'm sorry why is he so strong when he's in he's second evolution
Love it! More please...
Chamender could not be die if Squirtle didnt make him low Chamender kill almost all worm to save Squirtle but the end...
what do I do?
...
Make ep 12 pls
This is an amazing series
2022
Episode 11
episode 11
Char better come back
After playing the gen 4 games im really hyped for episode 11, I can imagine palkia or dialgia, (maybe even cyrus summoning them) in the next episode.
chimchar is a fool
I finally found this video now questions. how is squirtle gonna save charmander where is mewtwo and how bulbasaur doing did he evolve did he die who knows
What started as  a parody has now turned to a fantastic Story of its own....Kudos to the creators
I hope in the next chapter that was  Charmander he was a decoy  and he only evolved only 1 time so he's a charmelian
you should acctually work in pokemon and make films man
when will be the next one ?
Squrtal and charmander are great in 1-9 but bulbasaur needs some more love
It hurts soo so so much to see the gang altogether and bulbasaur isn't really cared about all that much
When is coming ep 11
Poor squirtle,he’s been through a lot,forced to kill his friend,then having to see his replacement’s dead body
Where’s 11
please make more bro
I need the final 2 episodes ughhhh
They need to make more
I am speechless
make charmander survive
charmander )=
Charmander should have let Gavin catch him so that he and the others would evolve includding mega evolution.Aggree
We want episode 11 🥺
Ep 11 RIGHT NOW
Episode 11
7 months already shheeesshhh
I dont like the new deep voice, does not feel right for me.
Bro where’s episode 11
Squirtle is the WORST! He let Charmander get killed after he was trying to save Squirtle. And then Squirtle gets the same mindset that Charmander had when he was trying to save him... I hope he ends up dying as well. And what happend to whiskers?
That ending is so badass "what are you going to say?" "Something" it gave me chills tbh
I hope Bulbasaur comes back I liked him
Great time to wait another 2 years
I loved  char mander
When the next episode
When will the next one come out, 2 years? 8 years? No one knows.
Bruh why dose this have to have a cliffhanger
Bring back charmander from new to do magic and bring charmander back and bulbasaur please
When you going to do the next part this was really good
Bidoof rules
Did pls make 11 ESP and also 12 plsssss
no this  cant be the end i have been waiting for years just for this to be it. How sad.
I think what would be a good twist is charmander is alive and evolved
You should make shorts of the funny parts of your videos
Bro all I hope is that’s like dido
Part 11 please
I'm pissed now that charmander died
I thought “snow way” was gonna be a really cheesy pun where they say “because there’s snow way to get past” what a knee slapper.
Lol it's like he has crazy demon powers.
dialga god of time  palkia matter, space, and the cosmos arceus god of the pokemon world turtwig piplup and (XoX)chimchar are the same regoin  where was piplup? longest comment ever MAYBE mewtwo just be fighting missingno bulbasuar just be chillin' wow
So what now
2 More left 😄😁!!!!
Episode 11 already been made 9 years
were is charmander i like him
im so sad that charmander died he was my favorite character!! where is bulbasaur tho??
Jimenez you have a good day at work today and I feel this way rrrr is working with all rfrtyyyuuiiopokkkkjjkj,jjkkjjjbbffvvvcffffgnmk,kkkhjhhhhuo
Fun fact: when squrtal killed snow he used the move that charmander taught him
i hope charmander gets revived
I’m assuming squirtle will get a chance to go back and try and change what happened in the past.
In episode 11, make Pablo and Charmander respawn, cuz I want them back.
Love how you introduce this new hothead character baiting an entire arc centered around him, then pull the rug. Nope, he's dead. Love Squirtle's character!
It’s been 7 month and still nothing
And make him ask make char and charmander back to life
Can u make somehow charmander return because charmander is my favourite like u can make charmander come back and he be in a fight with blue
Charmander said make these faster
Defeated to death! (You can tell because there are x's where his eyes should be.)
Also like your videos
Can you put back char under
Guys what happened to our charmander
You know some serious stuff has gone down when there’s bags under the eyes.
When will be the next episode its been 7 months
still waiting for episode 11
When is episode 11 coming
Bruh just make a new fucking video bro
Finally he’s back
I kind of want to see the death of Whiskers
u can't believe Charmander was actually killed off, Charmander was the best thing about this series and now he's gone (that's not to say this episode wasn't good because it absolutely was) Charmander he will be missed RIP buddy RIP.
It took them long enough
24:35
It's been two years... I wonder if this animated series is still be working on its a cool series's please make more
22:17
Ive been waiting for this for so long
Damn you broke his arm off what the fuck
Can we get a second season?
Can't wait for squirtle to get to the top and it's just the like 2007 meme of bidoof being god
22:16 "Move". If that isn't metal AF, I don't know what is. . . Thank you for this amazing series. Eagerly awaiting the remaining episodes.

Does this mean charmanders dead
Nooook charmander

Wen is 11 coming out??
I'm still waiting for 11 and 12
I think they are going to get dialga and turn back time
we need a part 12
Make it that the bug didn’t kill charmander
Why is this getting so depressed? I remember this series to be light, yes with deaths, but still fun and light and know is just... well.
episode 11 please and thank you
I totes forgot about this but randomly remembered after 2 years
Come on we all know Charmander is  gonna come back
It has been only 7 months it is like 2 years
MAKE THEM FASTER !!!!!!
“Friends are the most replaceable people we know” 😂🤣
"7 months ago"
So what ever happened to mewtwo and the glitch???
Wene is ep 11 coming

Love it❤❤❤❤❤ Best Pokémon animation
BRO I DISLIKE THIS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE THE PART WHERE CHARMANDER DIES OR NOT
Is it me or did I just see mewtwo
Want charmander back figure out a way to do it please
Articuno is up the mountain I'm calling it because it's in an ice area and articuno is a legendary ice pokemon and their could be an articuno shrine up there
22:58 XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
22:55 WHAT THE F-💀
I love the snovers in this
Honestly at the end of ep 9 I was thinking oh surely they didn’t kill charmander the best character then ep 10 charmander is dead squirtell now wartortle is the main character he gave up on everything then was freed then tried to forget his past life but at the same time relive it and now I think I’m done watching this series so when ep 11 comes out I’m prob not gonna watch it because this just kind of ruined it for me so now I’m just really pissed
This was made on my birthday bro
Squirtle's been through so much, losing his friends, losing Charmander, HOW CAN YOU NOT CRY?!? If you don't cry at least a little, then you're a demon! *sniffle*
When is the next one out
Send the next one
6:44 OK WHAT THE HECK SQURITLE
next episode will come 5 year after,i can wait...maybe
Where is charmander
CARMANDER NEEDS TO BE BACK THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM TO COME BACK
Is he trying to bring charmander back
The story is awesome, but this is a complete reboot. Either I feel really bad for turtwig and chimchar for their lack of personality and relevance, or the story is basically over since every other protagonist is out of the game. I wondered why abomasnow speaks exactly like mewtwo, but I guess this fact was just not useful to the plot. And what about the "find me in Cerulean cave don't forget CE-RU-LE-AN-CA-VE" bollocks? Last option is Dirtle getting there, but since Mewtwo kept fighting, it didn't work, and the reboot will just leave too many unturned stones.  Since a reboot is a possibility, the "2 more episodes" is just a soft limitation. If stones are kept unturned, the story doesn't ever have to actually end. I guess that means it's a perfect representation of the Pokémon world, then. That's all the anime has been about since Ash delivered the GS ball, after all.
I wonder why there’s a big gap every time this channel make’s a different episode
Do charmander really die
This is a movie. 🤩
I’m gonna try to predict what’s gonna happen next episode:warturtle makes it up the mountain to the gods of time and space and gets the decision in his mind either he wishes chimchar to be alive or..to make charmander live again and he will probably wish for charmander he was rude but he went into the caterpie cave to get him back so he wished that and charmander thanks him is walking around with warturtle when he gets into a encounter….with the caterpillar that killed him many years ago but the glitch that happened when he sent the guy(forgot his name) comes back when he finally gets his chance for revenge but since warturtle is so strong he defeated it but it’s not dead and while there walking around the glitched haunter survived and almost sucked charmander into the glitch realm but warturtle saves him but did not kill the haunter so he gets his way out of that realm somehow and found them again but warturtle was worn out but at the last second mewtwo saved them and I can’t think of anything else
Add comet
That series was a masterpiece? I wonder if charmander was ok...
Is squirtle alive?
Wait why kill charmander.... why kill main character... this is amazing too but this was suppose to be funny comedy...
I don’t few happy for squrtile
Did caterpie die because he dispersed its
Can’t wait for 2024 ep 11
when is ep 11
make epic 11and 12
I can't even believe charmander died I thought squirrel was going to save him but charmander may come back because everything that the important character's said actually happened like how caterpide said he we use charmanders body parts and when the leader caterpide said they would suck on bulbasurs bulb well that happened to
i was just 10 when i first watched this series .. it was funny episode, who knew stuff would get this serious in 8 years 😲😲
I wish you could make more I like it!
Is tertwig going to be a villain but whiskers and bulisaur are going to stop him with piplup

I really think that mewto will have a role in episode 11 and maybe he will help squirtle reunite wth turtwig and charmander (i hope)
I think I'm slightly traumatized by this. Like... actually. I did not expect this.
Porque rayos tardastes 2 pinches años en subir la parte 10
yeah your content went downhill, no uploads and shitty craftsmanship, bringing in random ass characters for no reason.
Nooooooo charmander and bulbasor are dead well idk about bulbasour

Ep 11
Please tell me that there will be more
Am I the only one confused about what happened to Mewtwo and Missingno?
I want to see bulbasaur soon
part 11 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
When ep 11 coming
Part 11 will meck you lucky
Or els i will diss leick you
Plis Do Part 11 and 12 i wanne Sie IT so bad
Squirtle is a slave to pokemanity
according to my calculations the Charmander head or the upper jaw .This is not our Charmander since in the third flashback the head is missing.so I think he is either given another life from arceus or mewtwo or thats just another charmander
Come on Episode 11
I feel like mewtwo saved carmader for their goal to stop the gliches because we see no refen to them so mabye carmader is a live
Episode 9 and 10 really made this show bad.  The death of Charmander and the enslavement of Bulbasaur and Squirtle made it so I hate this show and I will never watch future or past episodes until there's a single happy ending.
What started as a funny parody has become a story so filled with emotion and charecter development. This is no small work. The animation has improved superbly too. I understand it is too much to ask, but it would be sooo awesome to see the earlier episodes with the level of animation that this team currently has.
Thanks for spoiling the evolution in the description.
Please make part 11 🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Where is Charmander?
Can you please make starter squad episodes 11 please.
We need the 11th episode
We need part 10
Nice
I MISS CHARMANDER
Ok hurry up and make part 11
I don't accept that charmander is dead
Squirtle's/Wartortle's Level is over 9.000. If it's that strong now, I don't want to know how strong it will be as a Blastoise. As always awesome.
Can you make 11
It literally only took me an hour to finish the entire series but just looking back makes me feel nostalgic of the last 60 minutes
7:21 bulbasaur IS gonna be mad because she got charmander epic hat And bulbasaur got caterpie common hat
Guys the next episode is that probably mewto is up that mountain and he brings charmander and bulbasour back
i just wanna see bulbasaur again
This so good make more please
This went from hilarious to dark af lmao
Make the next episode now 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I wish charmander  came bac😥😥
I loved this when I was younger and its still awsome! The last 2 episodes will be great!
Part 11 I WANNA SEEEEEEEEE
I think Charmander will come back in the final episode
Man, so emotional.
Piplup: Am I a joke to you?
Man make more fast the episode 11 pls
When is part 11 coming out

Whyy Netflix you buy the 7th Anime for bad adoption give this guy money to do full time season 2 pleaaaaase (I think Game Freak only sue a little bit then) hyped for ep. 11
Dialga is gonna be at the top he will rule him and go back in time to save  charmander
Dude What if there came a ep 11 Where sqirtle Goes on top of the mountain and melets archeus Where He g’ets to revive his 2 kost fire type friends

Time to wait another year for so 11
May Charmander one day avenge themselves as a Gastly, possibly a Gengar.  The sad part is he was willing to spare them if he had seen Squirtle firstly.

Yes 👍 squirtle get revenge for charmander
Can he be alive
No charmander
Cliffhanger
Theory skurtle  will have to choose who lives and will be very careful on who to choose
I hate it when charmander dies
I wonder if the gods will somehow make him choose between reviving charmander and chimchar that would be a pretty interesting dilemma 🤔
Charmander😭😭why did you kill him squirtle
Boooo charmander dead 💀☠️
Finnaly after uncalculatable decades the ultimate Pokémon series has returned
Is 11 out jet
Charmander WHY
Can't believe ep 9 came out 2 years ago
The writing is getting better! Better than Pokemon anime/game plot coming out.
Ep.11
BRO IT YEAR STILL NO 11 EP
Ayo did all the comments get, like, purged? I somehow don’t believe a video with so many views would only have 53 comments, all of which are VERY RECENT.
I want part 11
Pls more eps
This is shit fire 🔥 😩 😫 😍
Wait why does this only have 49 comments? I could have sworn there was heaps more, especially for a 4.5m view video
Time to wait another year to get 1 new episode

See you in 1000 years where episode 11 gets released
Wheres Bulbasaur and Charmander?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO 22:19
14:35 this just goes to show that squirtle didn't care who turtwig actually was, he just wanted a replacement, kinda hits hard
11:01 the delivery here is insane
I love this one and I can see why it took so long I have to say here is make them at your own pace and I love how much care was put into this
Starter squad is a lot better than Pokemon Journeys
Did anyone else see mewtwo there
More episodes
years of waiting
Make an episode 11
Just put charmander's head on to his body and then he might come back
From now on, I’m never picking squirtle in a Pokemon game.
More episode please!!!!
Just found out about you and watched the first 9 episodes and now I am watching this one. This is so good, but why no more episodes? Also weren't we supposed to see their adventures and also see all 3 of them evolve? Edit: you killed my favourite starter.. at least if he died after his final evolution in a one big battle 😢
Bring back charmander!!!!
What in one of his flashbacks... Mewtwo is still fighting that glitch exe thing from ep 6 Mewtwo has been fighting that thing for over 10 years what the heck and I feel like that Mewtwo should show up more it's at 12:51 when I saw him fight that thing
I just watched all of these. And maaan this series has evolved (pun intented). Can't wait for the next one...
Wtf- Well i thought charmander and squirtle and bulbasaur would evolve and live a happy life
I hate the caterpillar because he killed charmender so I am disliking but if charmender is not dead then I will like only char is back
I wish Charmander had lived,it's so sad that he died!
Epic Gaming
Is charmander going to come back
We want charmender back

I want Charmander back Please please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
To be honest I wish charmander was still alive he was a great character
can we get another episode
Your videos are excellent!
( Charmander)
Man I hope squirtle finds a way to bring back Charmaine in part 11 because if he does that would be so cool
I would like it if there were split endings after episode 9, this one and a what if Charmander survived
Please give charmmender back
my prediction is that he is going to go back in time after beating up palkia.this fight will be ep 11 and then ep 12 will be him going back in time to fix things.
Hurry up with the next episode and bring back charmander
Cool video l like how squirtle has flash back and also when's part 11 coming out
WHERE IS CHARMANDER
I'm still sad about Charmander
I Don’t Like Ending Maybe Squirtle Should Kill Carterpie
Couldn't they just use a revive on charmander?
When your next vedio come ? Charmander also eveloved ?
I can't believe squirtle chose those slug pokemons over charmander
Damm that pain charmandes died
Make part 11 pls pls pls i beg you i will sub and like
What about 11 and 12
God damm bro this took slow
You made the episode flower year somewhere collectables flowers

Do ep 12 or 13 now
So the so called god tree thingy said he sent by gods time and space so I know 2 of the gods now palkia and dialga
Man went saitama mode
Nest ep pls
its been 6 months
I kind of expected a little introducing because they kind of did introduced the beginner Pokémon trios  And uh. they didn’t even did a single thing expect just immidiently see death
A fire type can't even beat a Grass/ice type (Which would be 4x super effective) But a water type can?? (which would be resisted)
will charmander come back?
This is so fucking cool. Never thought episode 10 would be a game changer
why charmander die :((((
Do 11pls
Upload another one
First 9 episodes were funny and cool then got kind of strange... and now it's real weird.
Episode 11 plss
Dialga

Wait where is charmander and bulbasaur?
he went missing again :(
Is the monkey dead i saw his/her eyes x's
rip my favorite
If only the trainer didn’t pick Squirtle in the beginning…
We waited 2 years for this bs
Dude if he asks The gods to bring Charmander back ima be crying
eeeeeemotional damage!!!
Bro am so mad that they made this about squirtle
Please make another One
i miss charmander 2 he was my fav
I wish you can add me in
this needs to be a game on the switch or at least a game in the same style like chasing a cant starter to play as and you go through each region as that same starter doing different tasks in each region and facing a strong opponent near the end of the region :) or maybe each starter has their own story and you choose which type you prefer to play as and you play each regions starters story in each region (chasing a new starter each region cause each region being finished in 1 or 2 hours would be too short for a game so mix em all together and have starter squad traveling as a game) :)
Wonder where Bulbasaur is...
why they killed charmander though?  not cool
Bring back the boy bulbasaur
I think that caterpie is going to turn good
Wheres piplup?
Make ep 11 and 12 and 13
When they gonna make part 11
We’ve all been waiting for THIS moment! 8 DAMN YEARS IN THE MAKING. Glad that I’ve been on this journey since the start and I can’t wait for the finale. The home stretch! 🔥🔥🔥
wait... Charmander is... dead.... Why.... can you make a plot twist where charmander actually cloned himself.. PLEASE
i.need.more.episodes. Hahahaha I like watching these. Make a season 2 and 3 Hahahahah i know im asking too much but i like these
Next episode boutta take over 2 years
Kratos must be so proud
It’s been 2 years since the last episode and it feels good to see it go on. I really want you to work on this Cuz this is the best story I have ever seen!
The snow guy sounds like Steven he
It’s kinda sad that squirtel just left both of them
15:42 I don't think a pokemon with 7 weaknesses should try to act tough just saying
BRING!!!BACK!!!CHARMANDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hold on hold on are you gonna add any of the gen 9 starters in episode 11
13:30 what move was that?!
make a teaser for episode 11 pls
😮 YES. IVE BEEN WAITING.
No Charminar
No
I'm gonna comment something to the makers of this! And the comment will have some heroic music playing in the background!
I want to see either Pikachu or Piplup in future videos
Who noticed Mewtwo and missingno there? 12:49
You just made an émotionnel rollercoaster... Like,i was sad that charmender died,but i think pokemon gods Will save him. Also,i want that bug’s ass to be beaten.
where is ep 11 😢
Charmander asked allot from others because he was willing to give allot. He didn't understand he had more to give than others. He was a gift that acted stolen.  What should he have done instead? Taken things slower? Value Method over results? I think he should have appreciated his friends even when they failed. I think he should have asked if they thought they were trying their best.
Please tell me this will continue
23:12 lol
It's kinda funny that I was playing Pokemon platinum right before watching this.
So is Bulbasaur dead?
Guilhe9612
PLEASE MAKE MORE I WANNA KNOE HOW IT ENDS
NO CANT END AT THIS
OK WHEN IS THIS GONA GET A EPISODE 11 ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS ALREADY!
Cant belive chamander died best charcter
I just want a Charmander to evolve
Where is charmender
Dude this whole thing is some of the greatest cartoons I've seen in years I even watched all 9 episodes multiple times even with my son this 10th episode is crazy how do we get more episodes sessions how can we get you to work on more of these cartoons donations??? I'm sure this ain't no easy to do task but talent is threw the roof if I can donate something to make episodes come out faster PLEASE LET ME KNO ME AND MY SON LOVE WATCHING THESE CARTOONS
to think  that i can last another 4 or 3 years or 2 or 1.....
wait my names jacob so i played turtwig
I was waiting for this part ! But I wish the creator never released! That’s the stupidest way to finish an amazing show! The worm killed the lizard after everything he did for squirtle, bulbasaur disappeared and the stupid turtle let the worm live after been released!  I will never will pick squirtle and every time I see a caterpie will kill with Blast Burn !! 😡😡😡 well done creator !! Well done
Make them fast
can you make charmander revived from the dead
Now we are going to have to wait a very long time for sort 11
Face reveal?
Why did he die tho
Fuck this series charmender is dead there is no point
Pls upload a vid when charmander is still living a three of them Cᴏᴍᴇ  back to get   Revenge on the Caterpillars

Can charmander be evolved in next episode?
Charmander is really dead ???
Plz make another episode plz
Did charmander become a monkey or did he die?
11:10
Bro l thought we will see charmader
What an amazing series 👏 I'd love if there were more though but anyway great work 👏 👍
plz ep 11 at 1mil
Can you make more
Amaaazing. Better than Netflix series
Yo is this a legends Arkoos reference?
Will charmander maybe make a return?
22:19 better than the actual evolution music.
When is episode 11 gonna come out???
I hope this doesn't turn into a cliche where we return to the beginning of the entire story. That would be a waste.
Dude I feel like he changes alot like how he doesn't evolve and now he evolves , can u make the 2 more episodes now I wanna know what happens to them. . !
The shippidge creater's fav must be water type .. that's why squirt always be and win 🙃
whyyyyyyyyyyy Charmander died
we need to make one of these scenes into a meme format
THIS WAS MY CHILDHOOD I DID NOT KNOW THEY MADE A NEW VIDEO I NEED TO SEE MORE
Not the sequel we wanted but the sequel we deserved
Make starter squad 11
Is bobbsor a live?
D d did charmander die
I wonder when will charmander AKA charmilian will come back
Can you also revive bulbasaur
Can you please revive charmander
Where is episode 11 and 12!?!?!?!?
DAMN IT SQUIRTLE ALMOST BECAME WARTORTLE MY FAVORITE POKEMON!!!!!!!!
wow
Vf?
Ayo is he about to get arceus to turn back time
It has been 6 months where is a another one
The casual comedy is still good but it doesn't feel the same
Do the EP 12 now pls 1 Days
And now we play the waiting game... Again
Please make more and please make charmander evolve to charmilion
The Fact That Almost Everyone Here Talking About Charmander But What Happened To Bulbasaur Squirtle Just Said Bulbasaur Have The Happiest Ending Of All Of Them Maybe Bulbasaur Meet Mewtwo Or Other Trainer?  Welp I Think No One Will Ever Know
I cant wait till ep 11
He said on patreon a new trailer should be out soon.  Good progress on episode 11, but it will be way longer than this.
I can’t believe it’s been six months. I remember being so hyped this came out, it feels like just yesterday. Hope the next episode is in the works!
do we have to wait again 1 year...
Next episode please
Next episode please
Please bring back carmander 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🐶🧂
Plsssss
Make more
We need charmender and bulbesaur back please these 2 are my favourite pokemons
More please
Rip Charmander
you need a larger group or a group of animators working on 11, we NEED to see it
bro i hope there are more
BEST ANIMATION EVER
So is charmander really gone? Because if he is wow can’t believe he’s gone he was like the main character of episodes 1-9
Okay but what about the buggy hitmonchan? The charmander died. And is MewTwo still in the cave, waiting for Charmander?
Meanwhile mewtwo is still waiting at cerulean cave…
I'm so pissed that YouTube didn't notify me that this uploaded.
lvl 98 squirtle 😭
I wonder if Bulbasaur is the god. It would be a super tragic ending having the only friend left of Squirtle be the god who was destroying him. It would be interesting tho because Charmander bullied Bulbasaur and this was his way of getting back
Damn Lenord got 1 shot in the back of the head
Ep 11 pls
good work!
so much action and drama
Now let's wait for another 2 years for the next episode
I can't believe that Caterpie got away with it...why didn't Squirtle kill him?
Two last episode to go , imma wait till my time has come🥲
Bring back charmander
Why does this entire series feels like attack on titan vibe
Why did charmander die
Now that world turtle going to literally kill God because Pokémon trainer didn’t choose Charmeleon crazy to me Red is literally the reason that the world is probably going to be destroyed
I wonder if all the Pokémon fighter at one battleground and the 3 main characters evolved to maxed and fighter each other while mewtwo fighted the glitch while the bird gives each of all the Pokémon some food but the bird eats most of them and what if sandrew grabbed some of the Pokémon down to the core of the earth and made some suffocate and what if mewtwo becomes a glitch?
Wait whiskers died.. She was my favourite
I want charmander back😭😭😭
Well charmander was a jerk I wish sandslash would stay
Part 11 plsss
There is no charmander no fun.
u should make charmander come back eveoled
i beg you make a new vid PLEASE THIS IS TO GOOD!!
when will the next ep come i'm eagerly waiting hop it comes soon
Man its been a long time. I've watched this series for so long since I was a kid and now I'm nearing an adult. I'm glad that this show has matured for the fanbase's sake, but I'm not sure if this is right. Too many changes have happened in only one episode and there are only 2 more episodes left to convince me that removing Bulbasaur and Charmander was a good move for the story. (and to finish up whatever mew-two's problem is alongside with giving more background to what happened to the caterpie trainer) I commend your years of effort put into this series but the sudden turn in the story is just disappointing to me personally.
I think when he gets to the top he goes meet bulbusaur or ivysaur or venasaur
Part 11 pls ps your vid its cool
hey could you make a more story of this? I saw this for a real long time because i love this vedio
Everything was so fun and happy, until squirtle got PTSD.
i think charmender will be revived by dialga or arceus
But.... What about the cerulean cave?
Make the three god damn rest of them pls
I can't believe the whole MissingNo plot was a red herring while the real story is a tale of the suffering that comes from blind obedience.   I love this, this is some of the best content on the internet right now.
Would you make episode 11 and 12
Possibilites On the top there could be arceus Or Palkia Or Mewtwo Or Celebi Or Dialga They might give wartortle a shot to save charmander.  Possibility 2 Mewtwo might have did some Magic to charmander to revive him he might have been wandering around killing wild pokemon to earn XP and evolve he will find a mega stone and mega evolve and since he is fire time he finds the giant tree and he totally destroys him thats why he calls charmander (or more of mega charizard) a god and becomes his defender while he stays at the top of the mountain.
Squirtel and bulbasour is stupid charmander is superior
I wonder why squirtle didn’t evolve into blastoise or atleast evolve twice
:Oh cool what are ya gonna ask? Wartortle:…….Something…
Ok I was wondering about mew2 and the glitch 🤣🤣🤣
What happened to charmander
lol rip
i’ve forgotten the story it’s been so long
Also I found mewtwo fighting missingno
When squirtle got rid of the anti-evoltution he evolved right? But he's a level 98 so when he evolved into wartortle he would have evolved to blastoise since when they are more than level 50 they evolve into 3rd evolution so what happened?
OMG no charmander died
part 11...😟😕☹🙁😢
Series started 8 years ago
What this is the end 😧😧😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I hate this but I love it too.
😭😭😭😭😭😭🥲
This is so sad 😭 but it so good for too a movie 😭😭😭
It was a good episode but I’m sad that Charmander died honestly he just used self defense in the beginning and then the caterpies  waged war so it’s there fault Charmander is innocent. And I REALLY hope he comes back
They actually had to balls to kill charmander
Part 12 pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee 😯
Make new episode
I love all the people commenting “where is charmander” or “what happened to charmander” as if caterpie wasn’t wearing his severed head in the flashbacks
Bring charmander back
Two episodes left should be next,right?
Godamm Chimchar is crazy
HOLY S#*$ THAT WAS EPIC AS F$*@
wonder how the beaver society is
The show isn't really "starter squad" if Charmander is dead and my favorite character Bulbasaur is gone
Wow, I’ve waited years to get this far when this series came out. And just like that with charmander dead, I’m done. Pretty good plot but you walking dead’ the series #longbeachgriffy
Yeesssss
what the fuck it just went like 3 more gens that's not the continuation of the original thing, fuck you creators
Rest in peace charmander ew will respect you
22:45 Eeuurraaaaaaagaaaaaaaahhhgggghhh!!!!!! Haha
in the last episode you should make it so squirtle reassembles and revives charmander and bulbasaur
I didn’t really want a ending like this cause I thought in episode 10 Charmander would be saved by squirtel
plz have charmander be revived by squirtle if he finds a full revive
hey shippiddge please make more of these unless you are in the work of this.
warturtle is a god comfirmed?
i feel like Ep 11 may come out in Nov 2023
What happened to charmander
Come on we need ep 11 and 12
WHERES IT AT? ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS! LOL
EPISODE 11!
iae
please, man, make Charmander come back to life
Next episode I hope wartortle meets another bulbusaur and charmander
it has been a longt time since i watched the last episode i alway re-watch every single episode and we believe that you can make this a great series
When is episode 11 coming out???
Bro i miss charmander he was my favorite
Why does it take very very long
You're turtle
THAT MADE ME SO MAD HOW THEY MADE CHARMANDER DIE LIKE THAT
Pls make ep 11
i can't wait to see the next episode Squirtle went bad ass.
I really think at the end Charmander comes back but angry at Squirtle and he’s Charizard
Can you bring Charizard but he's his final evolution and he's invincible and a god
The birds and just eat the Caterpie to make it a twist ending
Make these faster I beg of you these are so entertaining
Didn't even know part 10 came out but Charmander actually died say whatttttttt. But the story is getting intresting.
He just gave a big post on patreon.  Next episode will be 30-40 minutes.  The script is almost done with most of the voice acting cast.  It will take a while, but it will be a huge upload.
I love this series it’s awesome because of the amazing story line but I’m gonna miss charmander :’(
Just watched literally all of these keep em comin great job
Amazing
See ya guys in another 5 years for episode 11!

I know charmander has been dead for like 10 years, but I dunno. I wish we wasn’t dead. Like, his body acted dead but he really wasn’t. Like an illusion that the was dead.
the first few episodes were jokes but now this is straight up a sad story now
Worst episode ever
I hate this charmander was the best part
Can you make episode 11 about Charmander horses evolution and Bulbasaur
I want to see what happens when caterpillar is about to stab
What happened to episode nine I hate this episode

Charmander,no!
I'm sad
nah i really want to know what bulbasaurs life is like
I absolutely love the trees voices. I want more starter squad!!
bidoof
Fun fact: a pokemon will automatically level up by evolving which means squirtle is now level 99, still meaning he could evolve to blastoise at level 100
15:41: Foola
GO FASTER
Plz to a part 11
Excellent stuff! I can't believe this had been out for so long where the hell have I been ?!?!?
I dont blame you for taking so long, this is a 30 minute long animation.
Give me the shit
That’s probably why I didn’t pick chimchar
Noo why charmander have to die.. I wait him to severe caterpie head
23:45 The mother fucker literally just pulled an escanor "WHO DECIDED THAT?"
When a silly pokemon animation you watched as a kid ended up getting a new  introspective and emotional episode after so long.
Dude I’m hopping there is another charmander
when is ep 11 coming  I loved every single video that he makes of pokemon
12:51 is Mewtwo fighting MissingNo?
Bruh?
I have a feeling that Arceus will be the last enemy here
To be honest im sad that Charamander died   Edit: Because he is my favourite starter pokemon
when the next episode coming out
Time to wait 2 years again
Why you no sub videos
NOoOoOo give me more now!!!!
If this is Pokémon shield and I saw this fight in the beginning I’m sorry but you just Dead
These guys still hasn’t gone to the cave to see mew two
Wow this episode was INTENSE. I was not expecting this at all.

R.I.P chimchar
Shippiddge can u make episode 11 i mean its rn 2022 but if u upload some episodes i will be appreciate if u can make it and the episodes are so good quality
I bet he’s gonna ask the gods to bring back charmander, but as always there’s a twist….
Wow ! This episode is great! It's heartfelting and it's animation is amazing. It almost made me cry 😢
You should make a episode 11
is charmader dead :(
WAR TORTLE(coz war)
Man I wish charmander was back
Yes
I wish charmander didnt die  Squirtle is just as chaotic as him and i want him back :((
And to think... this all started when one Charmander took a shiv to a Caterpie's eye. Well, you know, when the plot finally took form.
Charmander...... Whyyyyyyy :=(
I wonder if they should make it so in the next one they Bring back Charmander and after that they should bring back Bulbasaur
Can you make charemafder back pls 😞🥺😢
if only squirtle and charmander listened to eachother
Where’s charmander
i am so sad Charmander is dead and so mad can you make him to be a life to Charmander like the glitch call missingno make him Charmander not dead but not glitch of Charmander did to make missingno free and do something but Charmander got one eye on his left that can be a good one
Allmoust att 1 mil
Make part 11
NT303 3:03
Please create a new episode I'm waiting for it😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What happened to charmander?
Theory. episode 11 is when Squirtle makes it to the top and meets arcues and brings charmander back to life.
YOU KILLED CHARMANDER HOW DARE YOU!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU HAD A MASTERPIECE IN YOUR HANDS AND YOU KILLED IT! YOU KILLED IT YOU MONSTER!!
This is so sad
Is there anyway for charmander to come back?
To be honest the older ones were better. I’ve been a fan boy for 3 years now but it doesn’t beat the originals but still good animation good quality it’s just WHAT HAPPEND TO CHARMANDER
I love this series, but I have 2 issues with it 1 the uploads are like game of thrones, and they killed and ditched my 2 favorite characters, Bulbasaur and Charmander
I thought there weee no more episodes! Include caterpede again please
Bro I'm glad it took the episodes for squirtle to evolve and I hope charmander somehow escapedand used a fake head
Please make episode 11
No keep making more there to good to only have 12 parts
I guess i'll have to wait another year for the next episode
I feel like the fearows and pidgeots totally would kill caterpie
I kind of want charmander back
I miss the first squad
Why do you have to do this to charmander
7:57 I HATE THAT CHARMANDER WAS KILLED BY CATERPIE  Edit:I want this to be caterpies dream
I feel bad for caterpie I hope she has a better path
Oh my god this is crazy I don’t know what to think I wish I had the words to describe
This is so thrilling
he was shossen as a starter befor his trainer was burnt befor charmander killed him you have to level  squrtlie to 100 to wartortle and 300 for blastoise
Did anyone see mewto fighting missing no in the background of one of the flashbacks?
I got a question. If the Caterpie said that Bulbasaur is now going to be food, and Bulbasaur is a grass/poison type, does that mean Bulbasaur is delicious but is slowly destroying the Caterpie‘s lives because of the poison??? That really confused me.
After killing his friend in blind fury, the Ghost of Pallet Town climbs up Mt Coronet to slay the gods that denied him his peace. He is the God of Wartortle
@Shippiddge pls have a spheal  and have him team with squirtle
your so based giving hearts to only verified
22:58 “WHAT THE FU-(dies)”

I wonder what bulbasaur is doing
You kill car
Plsssssssssss make video fast
I thought Charmander will survive
Sad
I wonder what happened to Bulbasaur
Les goooo
No really I thought FLIPPING MEWTO would save charmander at the LASSSST second of life BUT NOW ALAN BECKER AND THE POWER OF STICKMAN WILL SAFE HIM how about king orange theaters them all to safe him OR ELSE HE WILL USE HIS POWER TO DESTROY THE POKEMON WORLD EXCEPT THIS TIME THERE WON'T BE ANY STICKMAN STOPING HIM INSTEAD THE STICKMAN WILL BE HLEPING HIM THIS TIME UNLESS...................  The Pokémon do something about it..................................................................
I hope stickman that was created by Alan Becker all of them... the second coming red green blue yellow purple king orange the dark lord and even the chosen one himself and the second coming will weld the ultimate weapon and all of them are will team up and save charmander is saved by them and the ultimate weapon is literally like the stick figure version of the infinity gauntlet and tell me I hope it will end like that AHA Pokémon Vs Alan Becker they are coming for revenge of what THEY DID TO HIM THEY WILL ALL DIE TO ALAN BECKER THEY WILL FOR HHHHHIIIIIIMMMM
Bring Charmander back to life!!!
It's kind of sad that Charmander is dead all because Squirtle didn't wait for him to finish his sentence.
I feel like piplup will come in 11 because there are all the 4 starters both but there no piplup
WHENS 11 BRO
11
The grass types don't know how to evolve water types don't want to evolve and fire type die before they evolve
thats why i hate squirtle
So he died HE FU— DIED DAMMIT
PART 11 NOOOOOWW
I cant believe they replaced charmander with a fire monkey I hope charmander will make a return :( Although im happy that squirtle evolved
Nvm me, just checking for any updates on the new episodes...
You ruined my life for killing charmander
Love how I didn’t know how this came out 5 MONTHS AGO BRUH
Can’t wait for episode 11
The Snovers are a fucking vibe
I started watching these when I was 7, and I don’t care what happens but I ain’t ever growing out of these
I expected for charmander to be alive but the leader of the caterpe army has his head
12:48 mewtwo protecting the world
Any eta on episode 11?
No charmander died
When do we get part 11&12?
i used to check everyday now its out
Next time squirtles definitely going to be in Gen 6
i am so exited for the next episode (i think the next episode will be on may)
I want more
Ep 11 pls
huh imagine the next generations are just filled with level 1 and 2 and the highest is 10 and squirtle was the last level 100 and his team
Me watching me when I saw the hat of the caterpi. Me: noooooo
Pls part 11
at first the caterpillar was right, the charmander was wrong, but it did the worst, it killed the whole area, for what? power?, charmander did everything to survive, not out of superiority  and she even used charmander's head, showing that she wasnt better than him, she is worst
When’s the next one
You should revive charmander
I hate that charmander died
When are u gonna bd done with the starter squad series
Part 11
Part 10
Is it possible to make eposide 11 please:)
Can you please make episode 11 please
Did you make more ones
NOOB
yeah
Yeah
I heit scuertol
No one is going to talk about 12:51 at all?
Where’s Bulbasaur and charmnder in this video?
Does this mean squirtle is now level 100 and cannot become blastoise?
Impressive. Love the content! Watched all of these tonight!
I don't like that they killed off Charmander, it makes this seem like an eye-for-an-eye type scenario. There's no forgiveness in this series
sooo i just noticed the orange "hat" on caterpie...  So not only was the evolution notion a play on metaphor that Squirtle would never grow pass that stage of his life since his mistake, but he only suffered an exaggerated personality disorder of submissive behaviors due to that mistake. He actually refuses to evolve by choice because he hurt Charmander within an inch of his life believing that he "just wanted to evolve" (obviously not thinking through right away about how Charmander risked his life going down there to save him, Squirtle being too blinded by deaths to see that his friend actually cared for him) and it was originally his friend's plan that they all do evolve.   Even Whiskers saw it in his eyes that killing was no longer a problem for him since that's all Charmander did and his actions and choice led to the combination of his trainer, wearing his friend's severed head, telling him what to do all the time as he's already the submissive type; he blamed himself the whole time...   I guess Bulbasaur really did get the best ending out of all of them.
How many talking trees?
Did the talking tree say “fiction”?
I’m surprised when Chimchar took off Squirtle’s everstone he didn’t evolve, plus all of the other times it got taken off, until the end.
I honestly hope Wartortle doesn’t evolve
And i forgot goust type
Chimchar voice is was getting on my nerves
Who ever did the voice of chimchar is actually pretty ANNOYING
Oof i forgot ground type
Whater if there's like qorld bosses like poison grass electric water snow fire types of world bosses  and squrdle has killed 1-5
Chamander Rip 🙏 😢 😪 😔 💔 We wish him a happy lifetime
I miss charmander
9 episodes where Charmander was main character and "to be Continued". Ep. 10 Squirlte :yes charmander died.
You need to hurry up and make the two last videos please😁😁😁😁😁
Come on Charmander is dead 😭
boooo
Ok, I like this series so much, I just need my pal Charmander to come back eventually, like @LegendBoi stated, maybe he could have Dialga go back in time and save him. Overall, great story! Keep it up!
07:57 I just realised that's charmander's head.
Tell Wartortle to bring back Charmander please ruin my whole childhood🥲
On patreon he recently said the next episode's script is around 1.5 times the script for this episode.  It will take a while.  That also means it should be around 45 minutes long.
22:58 Best line of the episode. Edit: Damn thanks for the 100 likes I wasn't expecting that.
Have Charmander return
more pls
when will we have te next?
Move.   Goosebumps.
There is 2 Sinnoh starters just pretend that squirtle is Piplup and ta-Da! We have all the 3  Sinnoh starters!
I wanna see this as a new series pls more wartortle fighting god
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE 2019
Glad i didn't forget about this
When is episode 11 and 12 comming out
my god took you so long
whens the next one coming out?
I can't wait till he sees giratina
Squrtile is a goat
I love Squirtle because he is adorable Noble dice and strong I like Bulbasaur because he dies no more sometimes in a little bit I love Charmander because he is strong he has a he's a fire and he loves protecting his friends

Please make that wraturtle will go to arceus and rerive charmander bulbasuarpleaseee
charmander y
I'm kinda disappointed..was not expecting all this extra stuff..I thought maybe he saved Charmander by putting him in the pokeball..I thought at first chimchar was a reincarnation of Charmander..but I laughed wen squirtel, kept calling turtiwg Bulbasaur..but please keep up the good work .but don't stray to far
Make a vidoe about charizard that hé comes back from the future
I wonder what he’s gonna do with mewtwo, he might go back and time and the finale will be about mewtwo or the legendaries  Edit: 12:51 just saw this lol
All along, Squirtle is the main character.
Getting a serious "Would you Kindly" feel from "I believe in you"
This series turned from Pokemon into God Of War really fast
this is genius lol next episode pls!!!
And now we wait another two years for the next episode 😢
They ruined a brilliant story. I'll stick with just re-watching ep 1-9
Squirtle has black Air Force energy now he has become the poke-god killer
I have been waiting for YEARS now
2:06 Imagine That They Peed On Him
I want to see more of charmander
i want episode 11
o wn
ay when is ep 11 coming out i love this story
Not gonna lie I didn't expect squirtle to try to kill god
Wow, Charmander actually died. I wish we got to at least see it actually happen
R.I.P Chimchar
He’s going to ask for chimchar to Come back because he’s bringing his body
when will Ep. 11 come?
where is the 11th episode
I loved this
abomasnow: I AM AN EMMISARY OF THE GODS squirtle or is it wartortle now?: I am level 99
That charmender head make so sad
I want to squirrel to be in GEN9 Springtetto is going to be there to be squirrels partner and old time in a friendly partner
K believe it or not all you people saying that it’s dialga that’s up there on the mountain you are wrong because between dialga, palkia, giratina, Arceus, Dialga is a legendary with blue glow and as I saw on the top of the mountain there was a pink glow you know who has a pink glow PALKIA dialga would have a mountain with a blue glow on top knowing that squirtle is going to the mountain that’s at snow way with a “PINK” glow he’s going to find palkia and probably Ask where dialga is or he is just gonna try to reason with palkia or something
"I am not enjoying being kicked anymore" "I am"
So….when is episode 11?
When Leonard said that we are not winning I saw him mew tube
2:42 2:00 2:05 Chimchar attacks squirtle for saving him and squirtle used hydro pump on chimchar
Episode eleven shpuld come quick
"Creator of time and space" is wartortle about to fight palkia and dialga?
Where’s episode 11!? Episode 10 is over in 9 months ago!
Seriously 😳 Squirtle is kinda weak for a 98 because my low heath /12/123 health luxray defeated diega
Where will be the next episode will be coming?
God of Wartortle
More
I cant wait for episode 12 to come out maybe lunala will be there?
when is 11 and and 12 going to release it's been 5 months
1:18 I like this dude's attitude lol 🥱
I did not expect all this genius a big plot twist more depth in history  If they made a movie, if I had paid to go to the movies
I love this one pls make more soon
every couple of years i come back to these vids
We need ep 11 now cmonnn dont make us wait another 100 yearsss
R.i.p to charmander he was a savage but got ended by some worms when weakened by squirtle.

before this came out personally I thought charmander would evolve and survive
So charmanders actually dead..
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please post part11
Is charmender dead?
I just realized that the monster said “what the fuck”? And yah
Wheres the other episode , it's been 2022
Aight. See you guys in 3 years for the next one.
I hate  that caterpie bro he killed charmander
Would you allow this game named pocket incoming or pet impact do an ad of ep 1 of this starter squad series because that game stole ep 1 as an ad to the game which i tink is like stealing thumbnail
That evolution was so cool!
I waited for 1 year if had came back
I have an idea when this starter series will end will you start the season 2 starter series in which cyndaquil ,. Chikorita and totodile were there and bluey also make starter squad series of different different regions of Pokemon 😂
wtf level 98
12:48 mewtwo
gooed
this is a very strange and unlikely ending but I think the pokemon gods are going to go and give squirtle a time warp and he can choose to get charmander back or the monkey thing. I would highly guess charmander. then the lat episode will be overthrowing the caterpie and stopping it all.
This Is One of the best episode of the saga(i want  mege charizard X,mega venisaur and mega blastoise for the finale
Does this mean that Bulbasaur is dead too?
Charmanders ded not watching this anymore
Come on where is 11
Wartortles voice sounds like a DBZ voice
already 5 months and the next episode hasn't come out … is it going to be another 2 years until episode 11
Fuck this, I miss charmander
PLEASE COME CHARMANDER WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN CHIMCHAR, WHEN YOU CLIMB THAT MOUNTAIN THERE IS A POKEMON THAT MAKES A WISH AND PLEASE COME CHARMANDER BACK TO LIFE, CHARMANDER CAN'T DIE😭😭😭

No charmander
Moreee charamader
did you guys notice how caterpie's headband had a black dot instead of a Japanese flag
Flash backs
I wached episode 1-9
That bird sounds like a psycho from the Borderlands series. Even says what I would imagine would be one of their catch phrases.
If hes lvl 98 he shouldve evolved into blastoise right after wartortle
Without mewtho the world is gone.... he stoping the glitch
Took 2 years
Charmander 😭
Bad Charizard now please
I've gotta say Wonderful job with the voice acting and animation but, Jeez man it's just not a good direction for the plot I'ma break this down into different sections • The untimely death of Charmander • The fridging of Bulbasaur • The destruction of the missingno plot • The time skip & new characters • The solution Yep I'm... Really posting an essay on a comedy/light lore Pokemon series.  The Untimely death of charmander  Charmander started the series as a pretty standard arrogant douchebag, but his character development was done wonderfully. Charmander's character development finally paid off when he stormed the Caterpie hideout to save Squirtle, and throughout this entire raid he tried his best to show mercy to the Caterpie whomst he would have slaughtered if the incident had happened earlier. He gives EVERYONE a chance to escape, but the Caterpie are so damn stubborn so he ends up needing to fight anyway. Now what happens to Charmander after showing empathy, compassion, and mercy... Squirtle who was IN EARSHOT when Charmander said "give Squirtle back and I won't hurt anyone" tortures Charmander with water gun... And then he gets decapitated. Then his death is played off as a joke in this episode, because funny hat.   The fridging of Bulbasaur  Bulbasaur was a great, and genuinely funny character. He doesn't appear once in this episode not even a flashback is given to him. We are simply told that he was enslaved, and used as a food source for the rest of his life. Then Squirtle gives a really upsetting line "He had the happiest ending of all of us..." WHAT!?! That is quite possibly the WORST ending for an actually likable character.   The destruction of the missingno plot  The missingno plot was actually interesting because it was an event caused by the characters, and it was an intriguing and creepy mystery. Missingno had something as strong as Mewtwo angry and terrified. It is my suspicion that it was originally intended for Squirtle to be rescued, and the missingno plot to continue, but nope apparently we needed to essentially kill off two main characters flee the country and skip forward 10 years. This episode has ONE mention of missingno in one of Squirtles flashbacks (I'm pretty sure)   The time skip & new characters  I'm pretty sure the majority of people just groaned when they saw the 10 years later, because it's the last thing you want to see after a cliffhanger. The feeling of dread only intensified once chimchar appeared on screen. Here's a hint DO NOT MAKE YOUR AUDIENCE UNSATIFIED JUST FOR SHOCK VALUE this shit royally screws the story. I doubt anyone cares about chimchar when they get like 3 minutes of screen time and immediately die, and all that on top of just being a watered down Charmander just made me miss the twenty minutes before watching this episode even more. Seriously the two new starters get barely any screentime, and zero memorable lines. The SNOVER are more entertaining than any other character introduced here.   The solution  Really the only solution here is to rhetcon the episode, and it seems like that is the direction this is going. We know that Arceus and some other pokemon gods live on top of the mountain, and most likely dialga will be there. This means that time travel is possible, and will most likely put Squirtle back into his body before he was level 99 and a Wartortle with the experience he gained being mental experience.
Charmander should somehow come back or something I know it sounds dumb but idk I might just be dumb as heck cause he’s dead
Pls make a part 11
Pls make part 11
Its finally here,and I'm 5 months late.
16:05 “The Giant Tree” says that he is a guardian for the MOUNTAIN TOP DEITIES, ARUSUES (pretty sure that’s Arceus, especially since he followed it up with GOD OF GODS), creators of TIME AND SPACE have chosen him as THEIR protector. We’re gonna have Arceus, Dialga, and Palkia somewhere in the mountains and they will give Squirtle a shot to  save Charmander.   This is the clear and obvious choice in writing. Especially since Mewtwo told them to meet him in Cerulean Cave and we NEED to know what that was all about.
Great animation. No offense. I despise you. #CharmanderWasRight
LETS GOOOO ITS BACKK
Oh shoot this came out!
Dude I thought when the caterpie leader tried to stab Charmander I thought he was going to catch the stick start glowing and evolve into Charmelion then take Bulbasaur beat the crap out of Squirtle on new adventures.  Then in the end they had one last fight with all of them fully evolved and Charazard and Vienasuar would kill entire caterpie army, Nido Queen,  and Blastoise but nope you chose the very dark path. Well I guess they would have both been dark paths. :/
Is that the end?
ohhh is he going to ask for charmander back?
Can't what for number 11 and can you bring Charmander back from the dead?
Since roggenrola has a 50% chance of holding a ever stone then did the other 50% evolve? Then what happens to the other 50%? does that mean the 50% that doesn’t evolve become lvl 100. so if I forgot to take away the everstone (witch I probably will) then I would be super confused since I’m a dummy
You not good
people who watched the first episode when they were 10 are now 18
Imean pt 11
MAKE PT 2 PLLLLLLLLSSSS!!!!!

Squirtle was the main character all along
If caterpie is up the mountain that would be awesome
Pls make starter squad ep11
I need a full conversation between Snover and Bibarel. XD
Wartortle is pretty much Kratos from god of war 3 at this point and I’m loving every second of it😍 I hope there are gonna be a few references to god of war 3      Ex. Wartortle flying to the top of the mountain with wings he rippled off of a fearow or charmander saying “let the rage of mankey fuel your hydro pump”
Y’all I did Charmander dirty 7:59
Where's the episode 11?
Snover is my new favorite character
I miss charmander already
Ep 11 pls
Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle
Please bring every star character back
Where is Charmander
The ten yeats later might aswell be acurate
11?
I'm almost cried watching this I've watched these from like 7 years ago i love this keep up the good work
Prediction wartortal Is going to go the hell kill jiratina then kill acoos
Plot twist: in the next episode the trainer from the beginning uses a max revive on Charmander’s corpse
Can you make it at the end where tormez or comes back as charges are
I need another
Charmander is dead ?
Alright see you in 2024
Make bomber 11 and 12 place 😄😄

I’m so happy that Chimchar died he was so annoying.
Finally episode 10!!!
bruh no way they thanked winco foods in the credits
what does the kanji on caterpie's head mean? or how do you read this?
Now i need more
I'm interested to see Totodile.
Why did this video take so long to make
Time to wait for another 2 years
squirtles gonna ask for charmander back
Any1 notice mewtwo
Hey plsss realease a new episode plssssss i realy like this
Of his head
I can see Charmander's scull
He really misses his friend Charmander sorry for your loss Squirtle
I hate the worms and squertle they betrayed charmender😢
This, brought a tear to my eye. Multiple times. I watched this series when I was young. (Ep 1-8) and now seeing how it has changed into this, sad sad story. The Nostalgia is just, a lot.seeing this made me super emotional, everything that squirtle has been through. The losses, and death.  Can’t wait till Ep 11 and 12. I hope it ends with a happy ending.
I hate you if you don’t bring charmander back I WILL and I repeat I WILL find where you live
Snover hands down the best character in the entire series so far.
I would love if we could see what’s happening with mew two and missingno
I miss charmander
I miss  charmander
Why did you kill charmander
Why did you kill him
Dislike
you should make charmander appear in the next one but as charizard x or soemthing and be a complete god
Awesome job, thank for this animation. My like and mi comentary for support the channel 😁
I need part 11
The Idiot Squirtle got Charmander killed smh
Omg 😱 what a ending
He died god.. but this is still good
Omggggg
could you get the next one I'm excited to think about chapter 11, please
I swear. Squirtle sounds SO MUCH like the the voice of Suction Cup man.
I hate starter squad since this takes place when they died  and I’m f ing mad right now
In my mind the opening about Big Bidoof being useless is a nice counter to the "Shiny Bidoof" that ruined Pokémon Rusty.
Nooooo charmander died he was my favorite he was the best
Can we talk about Stickle? Charmander and Bulbasaur name Sandshrew Dirtle to "replace" Squirtle. Squirtle was not present. Squirtle independently came up with the same idea and named him Stickle to replace the innocent old Squirtle.
Chimchar sounds like Donniegirl12
Hey shippidge, what is your fav pokemon?
Squirtle evolving to Wartortle was his Super Saiyan moment
Dude when charmander head is on that fucking worme i was so mad its a  bad ending 😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
What's the music in the trailer called
I though I would forget about everything here and never come back and look at us now it has grown
Vool
Hurry up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11:13 “Your just using use to re-live your stupid childhood!” Squirtle was doing exactly what I would’ve done.  Honestly, I didn’t expect you to bring back starter squad in such an emotional and strong way. I love how you kept this super nostalgic masterpiece of a siris alive. Your the best man, don’t feel rushed on these because they need the effort and time.
Ep 11 plz
best movie ever keep it up!
make starter squad 11 now please!!!!!!.
Fitting that this came out within a month or two of Legends Arceus
He will save charmander and find bulbasaue and we will have the squad back :)

Squirtle died instead Charmander Charmander would evolved fast for Squirtle Death
It’s not the same right😕😕😕🙁
What happened to bulbsaur
Squirtle unlocked a new move! MUI
I wanna see squrtle evolve
This ought to be on netflix
pt 2
plz make Ep:11 soon please and can It be in kalos ;)
Make the next episode now I’m getting mad I will file abuse
See ya next year!
I love the chaos 😃
Awwww the bevers are sooooo cute😃
Squirtle in the flashbacks is literally any pokemon who didn't love their trainers
I feel bad that charmander died
I'm gonna make a really bad joke  Russia: You won't get away with this! I'll stop you if it's the last thing I do! Ukraine: What are you talking about? We live here! You're the one that's destroying our homes and kicking us around! What did Ukrainian society ever do to you? Russia: There is no such thing as Ukrainian society! You all just made it up!
Wait so DID CHARMANDER AND BULBASAUR DIED Ok im sorry ALL OF THEM IS MY FAVORITE sorry if Charmander and Bulbasaur doesn't  appear again im not watching this anymore
I’m gonna be 75 when episode 12 comes out
And i Knowit takes a Long time but it to long
Make it faster why are you so slow by the time you make ep 11 it Will be 5032
Why
This is cool
There are 3 theories one that I've seen is that since they're in Gen 4  They'll make dialga reverse time another theory I've seen is that charmander will be a ghastly in the tower and a thought I just had is that squirtle keeps calling chimchar char as in charmander plus chimchar is a fire starter who has a flame on its tail I think squirtle is so depressed that hes keeping chimchar around as a new charmander the parallels are uncanny
prediction charmander didnt die depending on where he got it:theory he evolved into charmelion and didnt actually die
thankyou
my childhood has ended
What happened to Bulbasaur?
I still think charmander is the right one the caterpie is the evil i think and if its true why didnt arceus stop this mad bug
"Something"
I love this stuff the best gold 👏🏽😎
BRUH WHAT ABOUT CERULEAN CAVE NOW
man the evolving of the series from stupid beginning to serious ending it's amazing
When is episode   11 coming out
12:50 Mewtwo still fighting the glitched pokemon eh?
Is there gonna be pt 11-20
Just found these, 🤪 and now I want more......oh well 🤯 The Hard Rock beat down 💪 was amazing 🤩
Randomly got hooked into watching these videos and did not expect a Caterpie to be a Sith Lord.
So I guess mewtwo is still fighting MissingNo. Poor guy.
Everyone is dieing
I’m sad Charmander died
I was a bit late to this but this was actually insane. Its cool to think that ive been watching this series since 2016. Also sad that charmander died tho but this is still insane. Were gonna have to wait another 2 yrs for a new episode but idrc i will still love this series.
Did anyone notice mewtwo I think Wartortle will fight him
I just realized thst caterpie is wearing charmander's head!
When are the next ones?
ESTA HORRIBLE
This cant be the end. Pleeeeeaaaase continue the story, im so excited to see warturtle on top of the mountain
2 EP LAFT
so cool, I wondered where is bulbasaur and dirtle now. squirtle really fcked up with his decision to stay with caterpie who killed his friend. it's pretty ironic when squirtle is the only one that would stand up to charmander, turning into a loyal braindead soldier following evil caterpie.  it went really dark after charmander died. so, I don't really know if I gonna enjoy comedic act like I do from episode 1-8
Did Charmander die?
Bro you’re so talented keep making these!! Can’t wait for the finale!!!
I love all the details and stuff, but I’m not a big fan of the plot, new characters, and the STARTER SQUAD  being “split up” ( and Charmander DYING).  Great animation tho! Even tho I put in a lot of *critisism*, please don’t let it get in the way of your masterpiece. Just wanted to share my  opinion… *i still didn’t want Charmander to die…please bring him back. He was my fav*
When are you making the other on
REVEIW: 7.4/10  I love how they stuck to the story of the original starter squad story and the flashbacks to show what made squirtle evolve and be so independent but it’s not as violent as it was Witt Charmander also no story with mewtwo or missingno which I was kind hoping for. Loved seeing the new charecters for gen 4 also one thing I didn’t like was the lack of random humor which the snow tree guys (forgot name) kinda provided but I think bulbasaur was better since he was a starter not just kinda there. Loved it though and I’m excited for episodes 11 and 12
I hope when he talks to the pokemon gods he can bring charmander back to life and big bippy is a  cool guy :)
MAKE PART 11 NOW
so boring because there's no charmander nor bulbasaur still well-made though, needs to be appreaciated
When charmander make a son with a random pokemon No - lizard Yes - fire A - monkey
Sooooooo Ep.11?
When will the next one come out
CHARMANDER NEEDS TO BE ALIVE HES TO GOOD OF A CHARACTER TO DIE PLEASE NOOOOO
I was the one who decided that
finally i didnt know this was out yet
That is one tough Wartortle
Still can't believe charmander died I thought he will evolve that time
He died?  Noooo
oye esto esta chido, yo veia el escuadron arranque en el 2013 muy buena animacion y historia bruh
Charmander tho 😔
can you make more eps pls
Dem trees kill me with the way they talk
Where charmender
I. Need more please this has better writing then anything Ive ever seen
when ep 11
No I refuse to believe charmander died
Some one:what are you going to ask? Wartourtal:something…
When the tree guy left it almost put me in tears to see them break up the squad
I feel bad for squitul…😭😭😭
bro i feel like charmander is still out there even the rock guy did not know he did not die for a sec and rock guy is in top 10 for the most op ppl in the starter squad show
The series isn't good without charmander
Is this a last part
Why don’t we appreciate this enough? It’s half an hour of an incredible 3D animation of Pokémon. That shit takes time and time and effort
I cannot wait to see if wartortle evolves into blastoise soon!
“Cool what are u gonna ask” “Blue turtle: Something”
Wait if he said he was level 93 maybe a little bit afterwards he should have evolved to even more
Make part 11
Where is charmander?
I hope so I wanna know what happens!
Poor Squirtle consumed by depression can't forget his journey with fire lizard and green toad.
Pls pls pls bring back charmander some how pls pls
Pls bring charmmander     back he was my favorite  character
Has anyone realised how sad and tragic this entire series is
Yo
omg, he died, charmanders gone o.o
Please make an episode 11
Plz send trailer of episode 11
I luv this series its way better then the normal pokémon
They should meet mewtwo again...
Still hard to believe that this started 8 years ago almost a decade i love this series so much!
Without charmander in my opinion it’s not as good as before
epic endng though still poor charmander
just... why did charmander have to die😪😪😔
Make 10
bro when ep 11 gonna be realeased
I hope squirtle will ask the gods for charmander and chimpchar to revive them
Who nows were whiskers or caterpie are did they die
Caterpie evil
Also does anyone think bever society is funny
Wait weres pipulup
I hope he asks the pokemon gods to revive charmander and chimpchar

The god WHAT THE FU-
shippiddge pls make episodes 11 and 12 faster
Omg this was awesome
More starter squad
4 months since this masterpiece was released good luck w ep 11 king
Im guessing charmender died
didn't expect all that emotion
That by some chance of God Arceus revives him
I hope that for the next episode Charmander and Bulbasaur come back again please please
Look i've been watching this when i was 8 now im godamn 15 waiting here for the next episode..
dude the bird was funny
please don't tell me you're going to let charmander merrer like this revive him or I don't know in my opinion he is one of the best characters i think i could do something to bring him back
Epic
Have you ever been watching this video and wondering how many people charmander killed, well over on my channel my guilty pleasure is counting deaths. CHECK IT OUT
When we will get the next episode please put it fast ⏩⏩

Does that mean better graphics since blender 3.0 came out after you released this?
One dislike from me for killing charm of the series by killing charmander.

Omg.. Is very seinen.

Damn. Killing Charmander was a real jab.
Can't wait for the next episode
No episode 11 cmon man this is one of the greatest series you're fans I mean us have seen keep up the great work!
After watching this video, I eventually knew why Squirtle was lv.98. Good~
Now we gotta wait for 4 years for another episode
MORE VIDOES PLEASE
Is Chimchar based on technoblade
16:00 I am no mere tree! Also Aruseeusuu ❤️😂😂
The Turtwig voice sounds like the voice of Jaden from Yugioh abridged 🤔
I really like this animation that you made.  I hope to see more Pokemon animation videos like this in the future in your channel.  By the way,I just subscribed to your channel.
12:50 you notice mewtwo and missingno there
16:08  "アルセウス"  means Arceus
we miss you come back shippiddge
Finally after all this time
The episodes are getting longer. Hope one day I can watch the finale in the cinema.
How to get ep 11 Step 1 wait Srep 2 wait. Step 3 wait more. Step 4 wait more until you pass. Step 5 wake up in backrooms…
I wonder what balbasaur is doing
Heckkk yeeaaaa months of waiting and we still have more to goooo!!! but rest in peace charmander T A T.
Mount silver is in this
SQUIRTLE IS NOW A LEGEND BC OF THIS SHOW MAD RESPECT TO HIM
Pls make part 11
Just released another video of Charmander Squirtle and Bulbasaur
L episode because they killed charmander
aw man not Charimander he was like the main reason i loved this show
Did charmander envole
The god “controlling” abomasnow might actually be mewtwo and abomasno killing chim char might be some type of punishment from charmander acting childish with the glitch
Can you make more in less time plz and add another bulbasour and charmander that do the right things
i think charmander is going be in a ice cube thing on top of the mountain
I feel like the series is going to end with Squirtle going back in time and telling red to choose charmender instead of him
‘Pokemons Can’t Be A JoJo’ 2:00 Nevermind, he is related to giorno
PT. 11 pls pls pls pls
1:19 2:00 chimchar barrages big bibby
Can you make charger big if you got green girl
ASAP plz I’m dying
Need 11
Poor charmander. I wish he still was alive, but this episode is still great.
Guys I'm looking at all your theories And remember We only have *1 episode left* How are they gonna wrap this all up
2:00 MUDA MUDA MUDAAAA!
Finally episode 10
The thing that is sad is that Charmander dies
FINALLY
make the pokemon gods bring back charmander! uuuuuuuuuum cause their gods right?
I am not saying u can`t rest but been so long till i forgot wut happen
nice
When is episode 11

Rip charming 😨🤯☠😥
I been wiating for this for 1+ Years
Rip Charmander
pls make mewtwo tell ppl that charmander has to come back to life for idk just pls
i want charmander back i startid to cry when he died RIP charmander you shal always be in my heart
This is a great series!
If you think about it, charmander didn't get the chance to tell squirtle why he killed all those caterpie.
i love the snovers, they are so annoying and cute
Chamder should come back like a Chairdlaird
22:44 not Wartortle going sicko mode
When is the next video
Dude what the hell it’s been so long can you make another episode of Jesus
When Is The Episode?
Don't end it like that bruh also I thought Charmander was the MC 🤣
I really hope we can see Charmander as a Ghastly Haunter or Gengar
I love this series but why did charmander die😔
please ep 11 charmanders return
breh we want ep 11
I WANT 11 EP PLZ
OMG SO GOOD
Squirtle could've just throwed the PokeBall at the CaterPie leader then Charmander wouldn't have died.
My theory for this is that squirtle ( who is now warturtle) will get dialga to send him back in time and do things differently and save charmander
Just saying when is part. 11 coming out?
rip charmander. he was a good leader of the pack.
It all started as a funny video now it's this
Squirtle calls him "Char" which is both Chim'char' but also 'Char'mander
Dialga is the only way :(
More please
Can you make a big a charger is a Vibing make him come back
I thought charge I was going to pass
when rker joins rker
Whyyy did charmander die
Wonderful as always
make Ep 11 pls
Starter squad episode 11 release: 2024
I really enjoyed I wonder when the other episode will come I cant wait
So much pain :’)))
YES ITS HERE
Idea: ( I will leave some parts for your imagination) Squirtle will go back in time to save Charmander and reform the team. (yes ik its a bit short)
I was 15 when ep 9 came out and I’m now 21 and ep 10 finally came out, stop taking years to make one ep dude
SQUIRT- I MEAN WARTORTLE IS GOING TO ASK DIALGA TO BRING CHIMCHAR AND CHARMANDER BACK
i watched this thrice its so fire!!! cant wait for next one dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is gen 4, that means Dialga exists, that means Squirtle can go back in time to fix his mistakes, that means that all the Caterpie wouldn't have died, that means that Charmander will be able to go to Cerulean Cave, that means that we will be able to get a conclusion for the whole Missingno thing.  I know everybody has probably already said this but JESSE THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!
imagine if charmander wasnt actually dead and was the boss up in the mountian as charizard
bro if hes lvl 96 then why isnt him evolving
I have been watching this since I was in second grade and now I'm in 7th its been 5 years
jesus christ, i started watching this series YEARS ago when i was much younger and now , seeing one of the main characters die and one of the others mourn many other deaths along the journey , as well as suffering major trauma from being a slave truly hit hard , i can't wait to see the future and end for this series
More charmander
wow great job on doing this
Make them faster
shippiddge hopefully your doing alright and good job making this new amazing video i can tell that your work has gotten a lot better then the first (starter Pokémon) episode you made. You have a lot of fans that support your in what your doing and your the best. Also your team is amazing too the voice acting is amazing spot on. Don't give up :D
i thought whiskers would realize that what caterpie was doing was wrong and stopped caterpie but no ;-; RIP charmander
I think we all know what something is
Can we get a new episode pls its been 4 months and a year
god man sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bodol
Where's charmander?
All hail our lord Bidoof
well heck.
yoooo its the blue shell guy!
I miss charmy now. And Baulbie. The only downside charm had was cause he’s arrogant cause he’s fire type but he tried atleast…to change his ways to save his his freind
Bro i look everyday to see if there is a new episode man
Did charmader realy die!?
*then you have chosen death..*
Level 98 Squirtle can still probably crush just about everything in game.
wow I liked it a lot!!!
When Will episode 11 Come Cuz I Am HYPED
Man I can’t wait to wait until 2069 so I can see episode 11
this is just amazing
I miss charmander
;-; u takin a hundred years again
what about bulbasar ?
No wonder this one took so long it's so high quality it's amazing
Next episode after 3 years yay!!!
Charmander should come back and ontop of the hill is dialga and dialga goes back in time and brings charmander back
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhh trash
It is sqwrtal!
When will the episode 11 comes
7:56 its scary
Yoooooooooooooooooo epic lore
Broh not only did a level 98 squirtle only evolve into wortortle, but he also managed to completely destroy a giant guardian of the Pokémon gods. I’m not complaining tho this series is great
To be continued in another century
Man ... when the next video come ....
BRO this took like 1 second :0
20:02
So your just ganna drop the whole glitch thing that charmsnder was supposed to fix?
When are you going to release ep 11
Part 11 plz
I'm not hating, I'm really not, but an Abomasnow would beat the hell out of a Wartortle
Can you please make a new episode
It can’t end here you have to make where warlort Kills Caterpie and brings back Charmander
make a new one
make a new one
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
what about charmander
This was a sick movie
HOW WAS THIS 3 MONTHS AGO!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
he said wtf bro
my childhood is almost complete
bruh please give back charmander
this episode was terrible idk make squirtle time travle and stop all of this
REMOVE THE CHARMENDER HAT NOWWW
i miss the old squad :(
I think the series is special because the main character (Charmander) actually dies, the main character legacy has now passed to Squirtle
I'm so sad that charmander died but this series is 👏
All flash backs and also bring charmander back 20:04 6:04 12:01
He went from getting picked by a brainless 11 year old to being level 99 and probably meeting arkoos
anybody saw in the part of 12:51 in the video where mewto and the un textured pokemon appeared?
Why did charmander had to go
I think they should make an episode where squirtle goes back in time from dialga and palkia and saves charmander that would be epic
Wartortle has so much Depression that he could commit suicide and Lose faith in The Pokémon Humanity and Suffering
Congrats you're almost at 1 million subscribers
(8:02 13:42| 6:05 0:01|20:01 21:27 22:18|23:04)

Charmander came back as a ghost ball when he died. From that haunted tower with the ghosts, charmander said he will come back as one of the ghost when he dies.
DAMMMMM I REALLY LIKE THE STARTER SQUAD BUT THIS NEW EPISODE IS TRASH

15:27 Oh look, there is a giant abomasnow
Now is not a good time
When’s the next one
I kinda hate Caterpie but at least in the final Flashback u kinda see him view what he did  Like u can see that everybody is gone so he just leaves   All he wanted was the best but he was just so involved with rage from Pablo that he never saw how bad he really was
hello? when is the next episode?hello?
NOO CHARMANDER BRUH YOU STUPID WORM
!!!MAKE  THE EPISODES  FASTER!!!
Bro what a banger can't wait for Ep.11 if there is gonna be one which I hope there is
FINALLY IVE SAT HERE FOR 2 YEARS AND ITS OUTTTTTTTTT
Charmander  is dead huanter  said then you die you become gastly
I waited years for this and I'm going to have to wait more
Charmanders DEAD?!
Where is chatmander
Don’t worry, charmander is a happy ghastly which will one day visit wartortle
11 ep plz
When is episode 11?
YESSSSS
wait a minute.wasn't ep9 about the caterpie kidnapping squirtle and wanting to get revenge on charmender?what is this.pls explain.did i forget smth.
The voice acting is priceless.
i wish the next vid that charmander  vs squirtle  in the end >:) i hope char wins
Wartortle? U mean Goku Ultra Instict?
How dare the caterpies i wont look at them the same now not even my butterfree that carried me
Noooooooooo
This was amazing but that's understandable since it was made by well over half the nationaldex.
NOOOOOO WHY IS CHARMANDER DEAD:(**
I first saw this when I was five and now I came across it again and I see this :(
Well this is a deppressing ending.
I’m not even mad that this took a year to make it’s really good 👍
It would be really cool if at the end he was just day dreaming and it goes back to the moment before Charmander was killed
11
WE NEED CHARMANDER BACK! :(
charmamder noooooooooooooooo
Bruh that was amazing I hope episode 11 will come out soon:)))))
Holy crap, what an emotional roller coaster here. Like I feel bad for Squirtle he’s been through hell.  Remember back then when each episode didn’t have a plot and was actually funny…man it was so simple and now look it’s gotten more serious now.  But all in all enjoyed it, see ya guys in a year or 2 for the next ep!
MAKE CHARMANDER RETURN IM CRYING
FINALLY
FINALLY
for all the work that was put into this the only thing that disapointed me was the like to viewer ratio.
When will part 11 come
22:57 what da fu btw kinda sad that charmander died rip
I hate this ending
Can't wait for ep 11 I'm so hyped rn
imangine not pinning this

Next part plese
Pls just bring back charmander he is my favorite
If u are reading this, Please just pls all I ask is for charmander to come back
PLEASEBDONMORE
I like this part, one of the Snow pokemon just stays behind T-posing like a tree. 14:39
pls find a way to bring Charmander back, he was my favorite
From a lvl12 Squirtle to a lvl99 Wartortle    FÙÇK YES!
I cried when charmander died and bulbasaur left 😢😢
11 NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How did the Tophatclan got in here? Henry ... have you got an answer to it?
I like the added detail when turtwig says that Squirtle is lvl 98. So, he has one level to level up to a lvl 99 Wartortle. Hence, he is so strong
Do part 12
Do part 12
Dude this is a great series love the storyline and how things have gone down so far I hope u continue this cause i really enjoy the series and the fact you have it from the perspective of the pokemon is an amazing touch instead of the trainer props to you and your hard work bro
Man literally called him 'bulbasaur' because of how much they bully him
yay a New episode
new season?
If it’s ten years later how hasn’t he evolved yet
Did you just re remind evrey episode until now in like 2or3 seconds???
Wait what about that missingno monster from episode 8
Ooooooo this sucks I want charmander to live >:(
after watching this my soul hurts I want charmander back please
Anyone see mewtwo in a flashback or just me??
WHAT THE..F-?
this series was sooo good I wish they would make part 11 and 12 but other thant that it was not a waste of time watching it for an hour and 30 something mins
:
how much did the creator cry making these..
Please be fast at it I can't contoll myself with suspense
Went truh pain to
Killed for squirtle
Charmander was doing all that for squirtle
I AM IN 2022
where is 11
In epizode 12 can you do that charmander and squirtle reunite
Why did charmender had to die:(
tree thing guy: cool! what are you gonna ask? Wartortle in an epic voice: ...something. End of the video: *EPIC INTRO NOISES*
I am sad about Charmender's death . It was really sad seeing him die :( But loving the series so far!!!
Actual tears, actual tears man.
You already know the next episode is coming out in another 3-4 years 😭😭😭
What happen carmander
part 11 plz
All charmader did to find squirtle just end wit him dying and to be worn as a hat
Can warturtel make all og F his freinds com back from the dead pls i realy think evryone would love that
I love how he made abomasnow look like a completely freaking monster...
Plays mayk another wun this wun was grayt
I like how the bag eyes on squirtle foreshadowing that he was old...
Big bibby is Kyrie
I think I don't want to get Watch my charmander
Bruh the best part was charmader's ruthlessness so what if he fought against worm thing, get his head to resurrect char
Warturtle accully means war
Too bad charmander actually died. I liked him :(
Did i just see mewtwo...
Is there gonna be 11 in 16 februari
What happends later: Chimchar:u saved me,why? Squirtle:mmm,monkey
does charmander come back please tell me he does
Thi was i mazing i love this 10/10
time to wait another 2 years!
Plz we want ep 11 plz plz
This should be a real TV series after the twist of the main character Charmander dying
thank you so much for making this beautiful series
Finally
Snover 😂😂
For some reason I hate caterpie
It’s finally here!!!!!!
I really don't feel that charmander is totally dead, because they met missingno and when that happens in a game, well everything that happened is corrupted and there is no other way but to start over, and so squirtle could meet again with charmander and bulbasaur and start a new adventure as it should be, who knows maybe that change of perspective
Prediction- Squirtle could possibly revive Char.
If squirtle finds dialga, he probably can’t save both chimchar and charmander. He might have to choose. Or if he manages to defeat dialga in a battle, he probably gets both of them back. This is just a prediction
I think turtwig is dead and charmander killed him when squirtle did not notice to get revenge
Charmander is definitely still alive
One more episode please your episodes are too good
revive charmander pls
I better see ep 11 soon or I'm gonna kill someone
This series is better than the real anime
I think squirrel might go to the cave that mewtwo said
IM SO LATE TO THIS IM SOBBING
I’m sad charmander died he was my favorite
I hope charmander come back to life
hell yeah
This has been going on for 8 years
Bruh
why charmender have to die :(
"Is he having a flashback?" I'm ded
This was epic. But why does everyone hate each other? Why are the troublemakers always the fire types?
And I subscribed to your channel
And I love you guys
And I subscribe to your videos
How did Charmander died like how
I like your videos
What
Soooo what about mewtwo
rip charmander he was a good guy
I’m sorry, but why no charmander he was the best character
22:58 "WHAT THE Ff-" I just love how this was perfectly cut!
no charmander : no watching
YES finally
Where's bubble sor
I cant believe Charmander died
Ooh I can't wait until number 11 and 12 look like
Finally!!!
WAHN IS 11 IS COME OUT?
Why you choose Charmander you shouldn't do balbasaur he worst one of all
where is piplup..
I love it
You really killed off charmander? Ballsy.
Starter Squad Is Back Yayyyyyy🤗🤗
Amazing I love this series
This calls for a SEASON 2 !!!
6:37 6:58 12:41 18:11 19:20 20:04 20:22 20:46 21:59 22:22 22:28 22:38 22:42 22:44 23:31 23:46 24:00
Plase starter squad 11
Mewtwo still dealing with Charmanders mess at 12:50 😂.
Not the direction I thought this was going but it was awesome
just use a revive on charmander smh
Why do you kill charmenda
I could wait another year for this
Were is the french subtitle 😭😭
What I think will happen: missing no will be revealed as God and mewtwo is an anarchist trying to take over that position. Some Pokemon will go to the cave and bring charmander back along with get bulbasaur
Part 11 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please make episode 11 I am invested now
Yes
When is the next one I literally cannot live without this I will slap myself every single day until there’s a new one of these
Bring back charmander pls
What happened to charmander and bulbasoar
Imagine chimchar I s charmander
Sob sob i miss carmandar
you mess with bidoof you are dead
this is so good
When 28 minutes feels like one, you know it is a great story/episode.
12:51 mewtwo
There's no telling what Squirtle might've done to Piplup just to take his place...
I see charmander where is it he is dead or alive please come on the charmander please please please please 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Charmander didn’t derserve to die
Whats gonna happen now i watch everything
well thats another 2 or 3 year wait
When is the next episode?
Here's to another year and another great episode! 🥂🍻
Its a shame charmanders dead but maybe bulbasaur will come looking for squirtle and mewtwo will have brought charmander back in the last episode and they will kill the thing that the haunter and hitmonchan are in and all evolve or it turns out they faked charmanders death or smth idk
I noticed that snow said arceosos as the creator of time aka dialga and space aka Palkia and when he said arceosos aka ARCSEAS
Sad about some of the story...but this was hilarious in some spots. Watched this when it first came out still laugh at times
Is charmander really dead i cant believe it he needs a return
okay ...... so our main character Lizard is dead, caterpie squad has been ruined, everything fall except Bluey is continued his journey and .....  go up the top to see pokemon God to undone the all deaths ? cool
i miss charmander
the big snow man wanted to say the f word
Your almost at one million subscribers
That squirtle never feared her... or he... the caterpie leader, he didn't even fear death! He was only afraid of being indecisive - losing his sense of direction. He wasn't worried about the life of his leader or not being submissive enough but being forced to choose what's wrong or right was scarier than anything to him.   He would always blame himself the moment someone got hurt that he cared about, and took loss as a reminder that he really doesn't know what he was doing after all, and that he couldn't possibly make a single good decision on his own.
AMAZING
I want to find out what happened to whiskers.
The team is just gonna slowly turn into turtles
This is a 4th gen team with a level 98 squirtle with as much years of life experience as any region's champion trainer. Man they could've buried the story of Charmander so far back into squirtle as some all but forgotten traumatic series of events, they could've made him barely think of bulbasaur and call gen 2 and 3 grass type names when he looked at Turtwig. I guess they realize these animations won't be coming out fast enough for them to manage a long plotline like that.
11:57 I got a car ad as Squirtle was having a flashback. That couldn't have been put in any better part of the video lol.
Man charmander had to evolve
blue-shell-man-guy
guys did he or she kill him on episode 9 or ?
omg squirtle almost evolve
Charmander might not be coming back and that’s heartbreaking
two more episodes yay im so happy this is back i feel really sad for the ending i hope squirtle gets to see bulbasaur
pls make more pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls make make more more more pls pls pls
Woa cool the big tree is created by diaga end palkia i thougth beacuse the tree said she got created the god of time end the god of space soo i think the god of space is palkia end the god of time is diaga
these animations and graphics are better than Pokemon legends arceus 😂
I just feel I want Charmander to come back cause hes my favourite character and favourite starter pokemon😈💀💀💀😈😈😈⛓😈
"you can tell because there are x'es where its eyes should be"
Why kill off Charmander!?
MAKE MOOOORRRRREEEE
rip charmander
bruh theses took months to make it is is nice to see um back after a few months
Tbh even tho charmander killed so many I still feel bad for his death
I wish charmander returns
He have 99 lvl now and on lvl 100 he evolve LOL
Omg @Gojo I hope Ur Right
I loved Starter Squad But It's Kinda Getting Worse. I Liked It When They Were All Together.
The problem is squirtle didn't give charmander enough time to say I need you back or something.
I'm so sad that charmander died hope he can come back maybe mewtwo can get him in time he did put charmander where squirter was.
plz do ep 11
Shippidge man i know i waited too long for this video but i definitely felt that this was so much worth it
12:51 mewtwo I saw him
We all are waiting for episode 11
Build a 11 episode next
Pin me is been 3 year
Are you going to make seasons of this? Please do. Also for the last episode can you please make Charmander come back evolved please
I hope the next ep came out soon
I miss charmander like he should live and show up as charizard that would be cool
Level 98 squirtle   What a legend
Squirtle went full kratos mode 22:16
This is probably my least favorite episode
That must be mount corenet and spear pillar
Can Mewtwo revive charmander
Wow... I didn't expect this at all, and my god it hurts SO MUCH. I'm currently ugly sobbing rn.
Chimchar noooooo
See you in 3-4 years for episode 11
Who’s waiting for part 11
What’s the name of the song that plays at 24:20

Wow
Wow 1 year of waiting

I don't really like that Charmander died it ruins it
I don't really like how Charmander
Guys charmander didn’t die there’s a video where charmander and bolbasaur are watching their episodes and charmander says that all? And bolbasaur said do u know what happend? And charmander was no

when is the next video
ep 11 when?
C'mon man, you can do me like that, tell me you're working on the next one.
Oh Charmander is dead
I WAITED 4 THIS
*Bird noises intensifies*
You have something going on with haunter/Hitmonchan thing vs Mewtwo that I could see resetting the timeline or something else big.
To put things in perspective I was 7 when the series first started in 2013 now Im a freshman in high school it’s crazy how fast time flies Edit: now I’m a junior time flies
Can we please get the soundtrack for this episode it’s so good!!!
im realize Squirtle sounds like King Kai
Bring back char ;-;
This is the bad ending!!!!! I need the good where squirtle saves charmander and the 3 of them all lvl up and become heroes
When are you going to make a new video
You should have instead of Squirtle you should have made it Charmander that lived and you need to make more of these dude they're awesome they're super good
As for my prediction the pokemon god will be "red" alongside with him with be the charmander that squirtle thought was dead.
I now hate caterpies for the rest of my life... :D...
Kinda depressing but I loved episodes 1-9!
Bitch no where is part 11 now
This man predicted Alpha Pokémon
Pls make a part 11
Did you guys see mewtwo!?
I feel bad for char
Legend has it shippiddge posts a episode every year
In ep 11 add pikachu
After all these years
Lol
U know why char died, squirt becomes slave and Bulba food?   Because they don't have Psyduck
İ hate the new  version
This was so incredibly done and never thought I would be so committed to a story like this! Stunning work!
Its funni because this all happened over 1 small thing.      Hey at leastt bublasar didnt die :>
How many Years to make episode 11 pls make it

I think you should bring Charmander back
He totally just said "Arceus" in Japanese. Is he really going to go against Arceus? Can't wait to see the last 2 episodes
FINALLY EPISODE 10! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A WHOLE YEAR FOR THIS!! YOU BETTER NOT TAKE ANOTHER YEAR FOR A SINGLE EPISODE AGAIN OR ELSE I'LL EAT YOUR FOOD >:0
😀
Aw, I'm gonna miss his old VA 😢
This looks like anime but fighting
This video said Squirtle is level 98 so wouldn't he have also become Blastoise during his fight too
can you make ep 11 and 12
I unsubscribed after charmander died
So when the hell are we getting charmander back.
New ep
Uayaayayayayya
I saw mewtwo come out of no where.
Dang where’s my boy bulbasaur at?
strange how he predicted the future of bigger pokemon with red eyes :D
Bro I can't wait for him to evolve into a Blastoise and Bash Skulls and dominate 🗿
Make 21
Just like charmander used the caterpie he killed as a hat for bulbasaur, he got killed with the same weapon and got used as a hat😬
Guess were gonna wait another 2 years now? Well this was an amazing episode ngl
LETS GOOO EPISODE 10!!!!!
im now a huge fan i watched all ten episodes in a row, this shit is amazing bro
Oy mate where ep 11🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Man he really predicted alpha Pokémon didn't he
the scene with the fearow was hillarious until squirtle broke its neck and jaw then started choking it
This series kind of like rwby you start small and evolves into something BIG. Anyway this episode was surprisingly depressing god squirtle's face is just pure depression 😢
*chef’s kiss for how the story is going*
This story started like some funny meme show and it got serious when charmander actually died looking for squirrel
WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE I NEED A NEW EPISODE PLEASE RELEASE ONE SOON!!!!!!!
We want charmander back plz
You shoud make ep 11 this was EPIC
Finally, after 2 years…..
THIS WAS AMAZING!
I like the subtle details on Squirtle. His desaturated skin, his battle scars on his shell, the wrinkles under his eyes. He's been through so much...
“Defeated, to death, you can tell because there are X’s where it’s eyes should be.”  -snow 2022
I wanted to see the missingno plot twist instead of this post war madness, it feels so out of place, you truly lost your way after all this time.
Is it just me or does it seem like this should be an entirely new thing?👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
And then we sat till gen 21
Wait where did stickle go
WHAAAAATTTTT. So peaceful Squirtle turned into Wartortle Kratos. Im guessing next step will be God Killer Blastoise? I remember when this story just started being something funny to watch. It was interesting how you managed to keep the humour and introduce dark themes like revenge and sorrow. Cant wait to see how this ends.
When will episode 11 be coming  out? Will charmander be alive
I love this serius!
Valimosensim
Mom
Hey dude, I know you probably won’t see this but I’ve got ideas for the last two episodes if you wanna hear them (I’ll tell you my email if you want the ideas just reply to this comment)
There is char but not charmander chimchar
Make apart 11 please
put f in the chat for ghost charmander
I’m sooooo Excited to see episode 11
I hate how he wouldnt let charmander talk, he was gonna say i came to save u but then he becomes the reason why charmander dies
Will the pokemon gods bring back charmander, if so what episode will it happen🤨
Bruh i feel so bad for Charmander😭
Can Charmander come please 🥺
Please bring back charmander
nah fuck that charmander didnt even get the chance to evolve had hardly any growth thats so stupuf he should never have died
Can you make 11th episode
PLEASE  BRING  BACK CARMEDER
Rip Charmander
The "what da fu-" was everything
Bring charmander back
2 more
When comes the Next chspter ?
It’s finally out. I waited 2 years for this
Part 11
Please bring back charmander
Bird?
When will the new episodes of starter pokemon come?? We all want them plzz
I doubt you're going to see this or respond to this because it shows here you haven't done anything in a long time just because others don't show interest in it and you got less used than a normal attraction doesn't mean you got to stop for those who actually enjoy it I was actually looking forward to more to this one because you ended it with a cliffhanger as if like something else was going to happen or another one is coming
4:45 Even Chimchar could remember Turtwig's name and Squirtle couldn't.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
When’s the next episode
It been 8 years .
Man this is so dope!!
Make ep. 12 PLZ
So, im guessing charmander has to be resurrected, then fight missing no in the next two episodes How thats going to work? Id like to know...
Bird sounds bird sounds I am so much of a bird
Wait does that mean if charmander is alive he will evolve!?!?!?
Damn I'm gonna have to wait another 3 years for another episode...
And I helped Wartortle and Chimchar on their Journey and then they need a villain name sparrow and they fight them and they win the battle
Maybe in episode 11 they meet a Oshawott and snivy pignte
O and has gone mad with power but both spere each over
What if bubasour left when he realised he eat the same thing over and over agen and was the god eating red berries and Tring to revive carmander
Charles’s bed and spread
R.I.P Charmander he will be missed
I hate squirtal
To be continued: 3 YEARS LATER
Rip charmender
I hope he can go back in time and save charmander in the next one
We waited for 4 years. It csnt be that hard to write a script.
I love how this started like a just a joke and ended it up with a really cool well written story, I'm really impressed
More starter squad please
this was so good i really liked the voice actors there is no words of how i can express my self this was real awesome
maybe the "pokemon gods" will revive char and chim
12:42 you can see mewtwo still battling missingo WHICH MEANS WE MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME OLD LORE
i have a rly weird feeling that mewtwo will revive charmander
Where is charmender
Sup man these are really cool I like them. I’m wondering can you make more please.
The script was really good here
When ep 11 come I am so excited for watching
congratulations you almost have 1 lakh subcribers
Bro pls bring back charmander
the guardian is literally just an abomasnow but gfx is on
Ngl this series is kinda boring without charmander
Please make more I hope you can keep this up I will love to see more I feel like I must know what happens
Squirtle is noob  Charmender was op
I was not expecting this to turn into the Pokémon equivalent of God of War.
WE NEED MORE STARTER SQUAD THIS IS AWSOME!
Man 2 more episodes left can’t wait until 2025 to see the last episode
charmander will back?
WHere is charmander
imagine if charmander got reincarnated as another charmander and beat the sh*t out of the caterpie
make them faster please
charmander died tho?
Still haven’t have the final yet
12:50 mewtwo fighting missingno
Damm, it gets better and about time since 9 years ago , plz continue the story as far as it can go ...👌
Now 1 more year for new episode
That Abomasnow saying WHAT THE F-!!!! kills me every time I repeat the episode.
Amazing work, I'm eager to see the rest of the episodes. You are very talented, congratulations.
It's so sad that charmander died
This is sick.  Can’t wait for ep 11
I hated this Charmander was my idol pls make this better when Charmander comes back please.
this gives me llama's with hats vibes
AH!!!!!!!!!!! TOO GOOD! NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES ITS SO GOOD!
i can’t wait for part 11
Honestly I think that the idea is good but the end of the original cast is so abrupt, and not in the good way I don't want the ark to be left at wtf happened and wait like 3 years for it all to come full circle
MAKE THEM FASTER DAMN IT -Charmander / Yeah make them faster! -Bulbasaur
I was so sad when charmander died... hopefully squirtle makes the gods somehow bring him back...
Please continue to make the episodes
You should get a job at a movie studio! Also amazing job, fantastic piece of work
What happened to bulbsower
12:50 Mewtwo: Damn you Charmander!
Finally...   After 2 years...
So long
I feel like he's going to go back to Kanto and see Bulbasaur but he evolved or was killed
Can’t wait for the finally!
FINALY
I can't wait to be in this show
Nooooooooooooooo charmander !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wartortle really bouta go take god's lunch money
These Steve Harvey tree pokemons are so chill
Did you guys see mewtwo
Y’know none of them went to cerelean cave where mewtwo said he would be
Can you do 11
I mist Charmander💔🤧🤕💔💔💔😔
I love the line of "If I'm gonna make bad decisions, then they're gonna be my own"
12:50 A wild Mewtwo appeared!
bruh i watched this series and its fucking funny lol.
can you MAKE PART 11 and 12  Plsese  ... and Emotional Damge !!!!
10 years = 3 generations Sweet
Why does it take long to make an episode Shippiddge
Yup you waited 8 years just for charmander  to become a side plot
Something..  “BEST ENDING EVER”
Man i miss charmander and balbasaur
I hope charmander come s back
How long until episode 11 and I know who the main villain is missing no The glitch Pokémon from episode five
even though its taken years, im stoked for the finale
12:55 Am I the only one that thinks Leonard and Whiskers have some sort of relationship.
i was sad by charmander death but when i saw squtirle evolve it wass worth it. this was a very good episode cant wait for thee next one
😥
awsomeeeeeeeee
Charmander got the Hershel treatment and I just lost interest in this. Build up the character then kill them to invoke as much emotion as you can. I thought we were watching something humorous before but this series went TWD. Sad.
Fantastic Job bro. but please make the episodes more quicker I cant waitttt im soooo hyped for next. please man just make it quicker
Can you bring charmander back? I miss him
Cant wait for next episode
Plss ep. 11
I WANT YOU TO MAKE THESE STORIES BUT WITH LIKE EVERY REGION starter Pokémon
New episode
Hey Pierce looks like we have more than just a first name in common, we both love pokemon!
So sad
What are you doing please make more because I watched all your videos I really love them and I want you to make more of these videos please
Awww Charmander died😭😭 can't wait for more.
I want to see bulbasaur evolve into a ivysaur
Hopefully xnerneus brings character back to life
Honestly he might ask dialga for help or ask palkia to make a new dimension just for him lol
So.. is it to be continued or is the adventure over?
OMG I really missed started squad episodes!!
bruhhh this is just amazing.. waiting for more episodes
Yess finally I waited years I forgot this but then I searched Pokémon
19:58
16:13
🗑
I love the Snover characters so much lol
#bringcharmanderback
Whoever are this is a story writing genius 👏🏾 🙌🏾
Another 2 Years for the next episode. 😫😫
We love it but plz try to make these faster plz.
Snover will always sound like chill guys to me now
Who else want to og squad back?
Not gonna lie, that Abomasnow looks amazing
make something about charzarid
nooo not charzaird pls make him come back
I want charmander also I'm mads
My theory is that only 3 episodes were left, then the next protagonist would be Bulbasaur...  And the last, Charmander. Also they said that Arceus is the god of space and TIME, I hope Charmander revives
who’s this squirtle everyone’s talking about I only know blue shell man guy
This the best
I now want a Pokemon Dark Souls game
7:38 quick shot of charmanders head-also known as the reason im hunting and killing every caterpie and burning the gold one
So well put together. At the start it just seemed like another meaningless Pokemon piss take but this has evolved so much! Keep up making these 💪💪
I hope chapter 11 doesnt come out in 2041, i mean, earlier
make 40 more episodes  and ill subscribe
Did anyone see the mewtwo vs glitch in the caterpie vs birds after math
Where is bullesauer
What
sombody: kills sombody else me: 22:00
When we all saw this in our YouTube notifications we died
I like Wartortles
Had a random urge to watch this again, can’t wait for another video next year!
Is there eP 11?
Finally!!!!! It's seems like it's been a century
If you go to around 12:58 you can see mewtwo fighting hitmonchan
I felt bad about Charmander
Omg finally :D
Imagine just squrtle fitgting God himself but you know who would win
i was waiting for 2 years for this
These snowvert guys are very weird Aso they talk weird
Charmander was one of my favourite characters but that was all on squirtle he was the one who weakens him enough for him to get impaled
The return of the king
Ok finished time for 5 more years of waiting time 😂
trash
who da f is that dumb monkey :( this made me cringe episode 1 - 9 is way better
I beat the game with only a Pikachu
I hope you put the next ep soon
Can u make episode 11?
It's tome to wait 2 years.... Again
Charmander should be not die
Squirtle in this is such a beautifully tragic character. Him losing his sense of self throughout his enslavement and his dead eyes throughout the flashbacks are honestly terrifying to see?? The fate of his old partners haunting his every thought to the point where he projects the gen 4 starters onto them and refuses to evolve so he can live back in the past when they were all together is just…wow. This series really ramped up the dark factor in the last two episodes. Also? I love Whiskers so much I’m gonna miss her
wartortle is very very strong im very excited about episode 11 keep it up
I have waited 8 years for this part
did Squirtle travel to Sinnoh Region?
How did a bidoof get beaten by a moooooonkey
Can we have an F in the reply’s of this comment  R.I.P charmander
Great video
After so long
This was cool
Squirtle should be in gen 2 not gen 4….
Don't worry guys,we're just going to need to wait another three years for the next episode.
When is episode 11 coming out
a new squad again of fire water and grasss but what happened to bulbasuarrrrrrrrrrrr
The animation gotten better, keep up the good work 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love the snovers ⚪⚪⚪
I feel bad for charmander I thought he would live
When that Snover said it had a flashback 3 years ago I think that meant something
Why did charmander die he was a big part of the story
How did char defeat him he went that way sooo
12:51 the hell is happening there
I want 11 :[
Man i can't wait for another episode
Part 11
I just hate that they kill charezed
6:04,12:04,20:02
I’m still sad charmander died he was my favorite
I feel so bad for Squirtle. He lost his friends and was used as a tool for people he hated. And he was a child (I think, he seems rather old now). Glad he's evolved though.
wheres charmander
Mewtwo have been waiting for 10 years in Cerulean cave
Wan are you going to make episode 11
Love how squirtle climb the tree like if it was in a God of War scene
another 2 years for the final, can't wait!
Man slowpokes really are slow
And make more
Omg you are evil 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 carmandr is my fav
Did carmandr oof
If squrtle si level 98 he Wood be blastoies
T
I can't wait for the next one
if u didn't realize..... HES LVL 98 and is still a SQUIRTLE
its been a year and a new ep has been made
Charmander died, bulbasaur stayed and what the hell happened to piplup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Old Time : charmander vs caterpie New time : fire monkey vs biddof
So i think the something is going to be to save char but the Pokémon up there would turn him into  charmander because he calls him char
Where's charmander and squirtel
Make two more episodes to go please
Ep. 10 squirtle gets charmander to come back to life
Fun fact: when this video is uploading it is the same day as my birthday
Damn, Mewtwo has been fighting MissingNoChan for 10 years!
The amount of denial Squirtle is in is honestly sad cause it showed how much he truly cared for the team
I feel so bad for fearow  he was being a bird
When is 11 comeing out
22:58
😭😭😿tachamanedaRe
ah yes, the majestic..                      blue shell man guy
Noo char
Who you think gonna win Jotaro? "Probably Arceus." Yeah me to.
Holy shit dude
OMG charmender is diet, charmender diet, chimchar is charmender bulbasaur is truwing
Can we have an ep 11
Why did it take so long for this video
Is charmander dead
Bro it been so long since upload 2 months. And no videos
See you guys in 2035 peace
The legendary series is back!
How long is it going to take to make 11 starter squad
YES YES YES
VERY STUPID WORMS
Been waiting for episode 11 for 2 months 😬😬😬
I can’t move on without charmader
This episode was a huge let down to me.    Now I just wanna say, I didn’t really like this series to begin with, mainly because of Charmander. There is a difference between having a mean character being likeable and having a mean character ruin the show. Regardless, I tried to ignore this. But, then this episode ruined everything. First off, we have a 10 year time skip for some reason, and ChimChar decides to leave and we barely get to know him. Then, Turtwig leaves, meaning Squirtle is the only one left. We got little to no character development whatsoever, which I don’t know about you, but that was just a waste of time. While all this was fine for me to a certain degree, the MAIN THING that ruined this episode was Squirtle turning into Wartortle and then becoming a absolute *god. Not only was it not fair, but the ending was just terrible. Your telling me, a SECOND EVOLUTION starter, is going to go fight gods on a mountain?* What, is he just gonna rip off Arceus’s head or something? That was just beyond stupid. The animation was great, but the story is probably just gonna go downhill from here.
Everybody forget about flareon, what if he comes back?
When be the next ome
Imagine adding dracovish to starter squad 🤣😂👍🏾
You should make a part two this was the best thing I ever watched and it’s just sad that Charmander died like he was like the main character in his the season to order episode 10 because I do not know
i miss charmander
We will wait another 1.8 years but this series is one of the best sad-comedy
Aww charmander died  . They were my  favorite charactor...
Mack a time mashien
I like how they’re not in gen 1 only anymore which opens up the door for more possibilities
Bro I started this series because of charmender and now he is dead I think I will not continue this series
OoO
I wish charmanders ghost goes back to his body i pretend that dead one
Wow I forgot this channel existed
Make part 11 please I watch all the episodes
I love how it is funny and saying swear words
still fun after one year.
I can imagine, charmander at the top of the mountain fully evolved into Charizard looking at warturtle or blastoise!!!!
CHARMANDER DIED ? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Uff after so many days i checked your channel and founded it!
I'm sad charmanders dead
k.....went away and came back to this. I mean I know it's gonna be dark if Charmander dies but this, this is on another level. Freaking Shakespeare-ass shit over here.
this is better than anything ash in 18 years.
Please i cant wait what will hapen next
Can anyone explain when caterpie figured out what Squirtle was really afraid? What was it?
Didn't enjoy this and not fan of the time jump. I only played and watched first 2 gens and i got over it 3rd gen on this is is the same
Bruh charmander is really dead wow... that's sad I liked charmander):
Yooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Snowver and Abomasnow were TREES?! I thought they were pigs...🐷
Squirtle is literally just a traumatized war veteran
Also I hope in the future the snowers evolve and save squrtle oh big biddy forgives squrtle because he didn't kill anybody just made them faint
For ep 11let charmander still be alive
I miss charmander
Just gotta wait like 2 years
I just realized that missingno absorbs Pokémon, dead or alive and it gets more powerful so mewtwo in the background of the second flashback fighting missingno was to stop its power growing
More plss
Awesome Video :D
Is Snover the same voice actor as Mr. Goldenfold from Rick and Morty?
literally 10 years later
It would be a Good time to Post
Can you at least do an episode where Charizard comes back to life
Where is Charizard Bulbasaur?
is ''the lizard'' gonna return ?
When the next one put
Finally a tenth episode you don’t know how long I’ve been waiting
Banger can't wait for the finale episode
Pls make part 11
I completely forgot about this series, and now I’m back it’s as great as I first seen it
who would the gods be? Arceus, Palkia and Dialga are probable, being the canon pokemon gods and all. But you know this series, they could be anything!
This whole thing reminds me of Red vs Blue and I’m absolutely loving it
Damn..man i have to come here after so many years cuz mostly was kid and didnt really understand everything and now?  Not only here to know the person who made it still continues and also get the meaning of certain things. Amazing job man on comedy,story,characters and hope we see more this new year 🔥🔥❤💯👍👍👏👏
Where is charmender ??
part 11 plss
i wonder where shippidge plans on taking this, i really don't care for chimchar and having charmander return seems really... strange. but this series is clearly a lil random so
See u guys in 2 years when ep 11 gets released Till then bb-bye.
Not my cup of tea. The story telling level is not at the level of the prior sequence and feels outdated, when the other one played with so many nuances that it felt fresh even though it is a play on such an old storyline that we all know by heart.
Charmander will come back, i just know
They never did get the chance to see Mewtwo again in Cerulean cave :(
I love this series 😭 the voices, the attitude, the violence it's amazing
i hope next part will come? i cant wait!!
Do you all think it will take years for new episode
I want charmander again please make another episode where squirtle save charmander by meeting mewtwo again
This is soo good! Can't wait for episode 11
The fact that it'll probably take another 2+ years for the next episode is honestly depressing 😭
Why charmander have to die
imagine if squirtal somehow put charmanders remains in a fossil revive machine and hes like"WTF JUST HAPPENED oh hey squirtle"
I think we all  agree squirtle killed off the best character in the series. I swear he is the reason I don’t want an episode 11. I HOPE HE ENCOUNTERS A LEGENDARY POKÉMON AND GETS HUS ASS BEAT. CHARMANDER WAS ONKY TRYING TO SAVE HIM.
Can you bring back Charmander like squirrel just finds them a wild one
Make episode 11
Omg please dont slap me. Ofcurse I will watch this dear algorithm!
This is amazing but I really hope Charmander comes back
I was wondering where iss charmander?
I like this series can they make more
Cool time to wait a few more years
Pls make Charmander and bulbasaurus Come bach
In one of the flashbacks you can see mewtwo fighting missingno in the background and I wonder if missingno will return?
I hope there's an alternate version to this where Charmander is alive and the trio gets to face the Missing No.   At first I thought the Caterpie battle was just a subplot. I really got invested with Charmander's character and eventual growth. But then it just dies off like that.  Well, from the start this show wasn't afraid to show dark humor and stuff so I wasn't disappointed, just sad.
Is this a reference to Pokemon diamond?
NOOO
I just love how turtwig is just like meh
Spoiler alert!! . . . . . . . . I dont think this will end in a bad way. Main character being killed in a story that he leads for 9 episodes? I dont think so. Plus. Abomasnow mentioned the god he serves involves time and space. So yeah. The story will probably have a reset button at the end.  (just assumptions)
Damn. It took me a sec to notice the orange lump on Caterpie's head was Charmander and I was just "WTF!?" before she turned around.  Also super Saiyan Squirtle😎👍
The time ep 12comes out i might have a great grandchildren to watch it with
wherer is charlmender ;-;
And make The episodes about them evolving
And 11
Please make a part 12
Where charmander and bubasaur
whoever voiced the caterpies did a particularly good job
Haha I started crying for this.
Squirtle threw one Bidoof into the mountain so we might meet he again.
Well,what about mewtwo and the cerulean cave he was talking about? I guess squirtle is going there in one of the remaining 2 episodes!
So good can’t wait another year for The next part to come out
why Charmander died he is the hero
this has been my childhood series. never knew it would be this emotional. theory of what comes next(i am aware or ep 11) wartortle climbs to the top, and there is a sacred book that only pokemon over lvl 95 can access. wartortle performs a ritual in the book to bring back the lives he had lost, and his friends appear in a block of ice. wartortle patiently waits, and then the ice cracks. and he is reunited
Please I’m begging you don’t take as long to make the next one is this one please I need more of this
LESS FUKIN GOOO NOW WE GET TO WAIT ANOTHER FOUR YEARS FOR THE NEXT ONEEE
Why would you edit the video so charmader died charmander is my favourite.why............ ):c
Iam also hoping we get to see dialaga help squirtle get back charmander and now iam wondering what happened to the missingno
Plzzzzzz make the next episode fast,I can not wait for it😁
It's sad seeing charmander dead atleast he cared for the team carterpie literally just inslaves ppl
Trash squirtle have ultra instinct wtf did u think I  loved all of it but after charmander died it’s boring u change the genre from funny to revenge serious bro there was  much better options charmander should go to mewto even like mewto shows up saved charmander or whatever so many things killing main char always bad decision until it’s the last episode
This is very much a jump-the-shark moment for me.
Dang this is really good👍
Make part 11
Anyone else binge watch all the chapters?
I want charmader  back  please
Please make at least 9 more episodes 🙏🙏
Aw so charmander died :(
Im kinda sad nothings of the last episodes were saved it kinda feels like that was all for nothing
Worlds greatest comebacks 2022
Squirtle : *Evolves* Charmander : Hey that was my job!
Hurry up and make 11 ice bin eating for a year
EPISODE 11 COMING NEVER GET LOST LOSERS LOL
espera que paso con bulbasaur

When the next episode will exit?
This is gow + Pokémon now and i am totally here for it!
Great job on these videos Shippiddge! Soon 1,000,000 subscribers
Please bring back charmander with some sort of storyline. I honestly only watched this because of charmander and what is the storyline is there isnt a badass guy Who's learning as he lives.
So basically after charmander died kanto is destroyed and squirtle travelled to sinnoh that is pretty strange
No Charmander :,(
Ma boi chimchar is 4x super effective agaisn’t Abomasnow and died , say F for respect
The fat beaver is jayingee I can tell by the voice
imagine warltortle evolved
The legend die in the last episode 😭😭
Abomasnow was like "WHAT THE FU--"🤣🤣BOOM SHELL SMASH 🤣
pls 11 a12
of all the sinnoh pokemon you added, you added my favourite
Bring back Charmander
17:54 "You can tell because there are X's where its eyes should be" This dialogue is perfect XDD, ty for creating these videos
I won chapter 11 come out where Charmander come back to life and Bulbasaur come back but evolved to a Venusaur
We need session two it’ll be amazing 🥲
Yo love this series I. Want to see bubblasor and squirtle duo
Cant wait for the next ep!😄
The next one is going to be a nther 2 years
oh my god...
BRING BEACK CHARMANDER AS A GHOSTLY PLZ HIS MY FAVORITE POKEMON
This is scary, I predicted exactly this would happen in episode 9 about 2 years ago.... seriously.
since the start of this series it's been what, 8 years? safe to say that starter squad has been part of my childhood by now, and seeing it develop in this direction is pleasant to say the least! keep up the good work, you and the rest of the team <3
19:54 I like How its T-Posing Rn Lol
I think squrtle hmmm wartortole will kill arceus
Waiting for the next episode
All that build-up and journey with Charmander and y’all just kill him off like that? lol y’all really just killed off the main character.
Why didn’t shirtless evolve into blastoise if he’s level 99
Why  do there  is  not  charmander
come on make ep 11 and ep 12 next year okay or i will unsubscribed this channel i bin waiting so longgggg
Where did turwig go🤔?

When are you going to make part 11 i’m so excited. but what did you stop making videos for year but please just make it
imma keep it straigh up i enjoyed this but not as good without bulbasaur
Why the fuck did Charmander died
Waiting for next episode 🤗💞
when is ep 2 coming out
We would love for a return of Charmander.
I was sad to hear what happened to charmander all these years after episode 9 I thought charmander would survive
I completely forgot this existed. Okay, now let's wait another year.
You can tell because there are X's where his eyes should be... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yaay see you guys after a year
No where is charmender
Finally
2 more episodes yey
Ooooooooooooooooooooh episode 10?! Omg make episode 11! Make episode 11!!!!!!!!
YEEESSSS
Charmander Died 👎 My long wait was nothing for me, sorry
Bruh like every single character died
When is the next episode coming out
Imagine this becoming a undertale au and would have disbelief squirtle (after charmander's death)
Being one level higher should not make a huge difference in power, even he evolves.
THE MOST MOTHERFUCKING ANTICIPATED-
So pretty and nails look amazing.
The cruel irony of caterpie using charmanders head as a hate is genius
I wonder what Mewtwo's reaction was when he found out about Charmander since Mewtwo told him to meet him at.. uh I forgot the name
OMG seriously no way did charmander actually died I loved every episode in this animation but out of all of the episode this is the worst episode ever pls fix this pls save charmander and bolbasour
YOOOOO SQUIRTLE EVOLVED!!!
Haha can’t wait for fuckin’ caterpie to die
The worm is the BADDEST thing in my existence if squirter becomes blastoise and kills that worm
Holy shit, it’s finally here.
https://youtu.be/Ht15ISGCKbM here you can see cats getting scared by cucumbers, it's very funny
Can someone tell me how long this season 2 gonna be ?
Stickle
Please let Charmander live on
It’s finally here
Man time flies. I started watching this when I entered high school. And now finishing my last year of university…
Okay. N-no. I watched starter squads years ago, years later watch episode 9, was wondering how Charmander survivded because I low key wanted him to continue his rampage but now this?!?!?! N- no. NOOOOO. CHARMANDERRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! SOMEBODY CALL DIALGA!!! Edit: wait…            THE GLITCH Wait…           12:50 bruh
Truly our friends are the most replaceable people we know.
Where blubasaur go
I'll miss Charmander but your work is excellent!!
Oh yeah, I know that PlayStation game  God of Wartortle
what happen to bobasaur and charmander
Holy cringe
Just remember if he keeps going at this pace 4 years till we see the end been here since ep 5
2 months
finally!
Where is Bulbasaur, did they bugs eat that bulky plant?
<3 perfeito isso mano
I kinda wish charmander didnt die. He was my favourite.
Why does it take a whole eternity for 1 new video?
Ok
snover-basically cleveland from family guy.
I don't like it  1:I like chazard  2: chazard is gone  3:I hate that monkey
''stickle!'' X''D
well in the 3 ep left it said charmander is alive maybe he is the god on the volcano and he is now a charizard and wartortle becomes blastoise and fights him
11 episode will came
i have be waiting for years
i want the lizard back a live
This is litteraly Xenoblades plot.
THE OGS HAVE BEEN HERE FROM EPISODE FIVE AND WATIED 8 FUCKING YEARS FOR THIS YEAHHHHHHHHHH
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwww
I hope Squirtle knows this doesn't change anything about Charmander he's still betrayed him now he's just trying to make up for the lost causes that's his fault traitor
Evolve him into Blastoise next
I actually began crying,
2025: Episode 11.
What happened to bulbasaur 😦
Maybe charmander knew something no one else could
Comon man how meni tim it need just make part 11 and 12 pls pls prete plssssss
I guess I have to wait like a 2 years Agen
when is there episode 11
6:07
Create episode 11
I love squirtle in the real game but hate him in this series but I still love this series. Just recommending but maybe charmander can come back because the gods sense waturtles power
What happened to bulbasaur?
And I really thought this would be the finale.
What happened to bulbasaur ????
Finally this
Make them longer please
Download permainan FF sabun lemon
I've waited so long
We’ll see you guys in 2 years
Next time be quicker         “Like that would ever happen” -Shrek
THIS. IS. DOPE. AS. F%$#!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE....EVENTUALLY!!
I want to see even more so the one who made this video can you make more episodes?
Compared to episodes 1 through 9, this episode is pretty weak in my opinion... And I'm a fan!! Keep supporting the series guys!! It will need it.
I think there is gonna be a plot twist that charmander acctually a live
11 with arcius
Is no one gonna talk about how the shaders and the graphics looked amazing?
It was sad to knoe charmander died
Cant belive ep.10 is here
I miss charamander
I just realised, everyone in the Caterpie army except for the leader and Squirtle are dead, and both have gone their seperate ways. Bulbasaur is either alone back at the base eating the entire stock of berries or dead due to a base invasion.
I love it when charmander is still there but you ruined o love the starter squad now its lost squad
i wish squirrel was replaced with charmender
That snow giant, when he died, he said “ What the fu*boom”
I enjoyed this series, but personally, I'm not a fan of this episode. Felt like it was trying too hard to be a deep, complex story. Like there was no mention of any gods before this episode. I don't even think anyone said "oh my God" so it just felt super random.  And Chimchar's death was also weird. Were we supposed to feel sad? The guy was alive for less than 5 minutes on screen so there was no connection made with the viewer whatsoever. Not to mention that he was a total prick. At least Charmander had some redeemable qualities (leadership, free thinker, funny). Chimchar just opened up by attacking some random Bidoof but needing to get saved.   Overall, I still think the series has the potential to end well, but this was disappointing.
What happend to charmander
Definitely appreciated the passionate philosophical defense of free will by Squirtle!
Can’t wait for another episode in 9 months!
Not gonna lie, would of liked it better if Charmander hadn't died but this is still pretty good.
Charmander nooo your kill I help you
I was waiting soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for this
Would be awesome too see wartortle evolve into blastoise then gmax
Bring Charmander back now I miss him
Damn, keep up the good work.
Come on 2 episode left
I want them to find the  to summon or find dilalga and rewind time and bring back Charmander and stop the war (this is going to be so epic😀)
Upload episode 11 quickly pls
Hi
Hi
When is the next episode coming out
EPISODE 11 !!!!
Well time to wait many years later
12:51 Mewtwo is still fighting missingno and is still waiting for Charmander lol
Squirtle: Evolves Charmander's ghost: AWW COME ON!
The Wait Starts!!
Nice tip
charmander NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
in the next episode bring  charmander back please
Pokémon don't swear bruh and they DO NOT fight Caterpie like that...the tear of the heads horrifies me a lot
More
wait uhh i got ep 9 in my recommended dicided to check and.... FINALLY
Can you please have charmander back to life in episode 11 and episode 12
plz make ep 12
Snover is the best character Change my mind
part 11 pis
Please no not charmander😭
Is charmander going to come back?
THis is so good i want more please do more.
Animation takes him forever to make a new episode but Episode 11 might be coming out until 2023 but Animation is very hard and let's hope to see the finale but Episode 11 and 12
Wartortle is probably going to 1v1 Arceus on Final Destination.
This is awesome, but sort of made me depressed at the end. If charmander somehow got back to life, I think all the fans would be here for it.
When's is episode 11 coming out
Literal Chills....
This my first episode lol pretty dope
Surprised squirtle isn’t going up to dialga to change the past. Maybe prevent missingno, maybe save charmander. Idk I thought charmander was gonna be saved, but who knows what’ll happen at this point. Also the snover & bidont were super relatable.
op animation
That was an awesome episode
mans back to haidas
The snorunts had me dying this entire episode
I know charmander killed lots of pokemons, but it's really sad to see him dead. And I think the leader caterpie is worse than charmander.
And my favorite pokemon is squirtel
This is the best video I ever seen and I knew that squirt would evolve keep up  the good work ur the best youtuber ever
The Snovers 🤣🤣🤣
GIVE ME A LOOK AT STARTER SQUAD EPISODE 11 RIGHT NOW OR ELSE
Please next episode
I need episode 11 and 12
This became a crazy ass show. But its still funny. When its done, you should do some editing to the originals and make a whole ass professional move
I cant believe charmander died
There needs to be an episode 11 so far it's one of my favorite series ever
Of his is level 98 then why did't he Level up :/ you level up at Power 30 bruh and I still enjoy it to the god killed char and I'm just confused 😕
:(
Me Miss charmander
I want to see mewtwo again. He was my favorite depiction of that pokemon and I'd like to see the return of him. It'd be awesome if he was the pokemon at the top of the mountain even though he said to find him in cerulean cave.
finally part 10
God of war
This would’ve been good if Charmander hadn’t Died I still loved to watch it though
Hes going to heaven to listen to Charmander cuss him out for a whole hour
When is the 11th Episode coming out?
Well... That took a turn for the worst
12:49 Did l just see mewtwo 🤯
This shit got lame.
ep 11 its been 2 months\
Where's Bulbasaur?
Level 98 evolves and become 198
hE EVO HOLy …..
what happened to charmander
Is that true
Me before watching: oh! Cool! A new episode dropped :D Me after:…I need a hug
There hasn't been another starter sqaud for 2 months
Know what Pokemon God he should fight fire god
Omg this was amazing please do a part 2
i bet $100 that the pokemon gods are dialga and palkia
Надеюсь следующую серию не придётся опять ждать 2 года
Dude must have godly IV's.
This is a really  great evolution from squirtle.😀😁
a time when a starter water type can absolutely shred a starter grass-type because char and turt are like level 5 and wartortle is like level 100
When will the next episode come out and will bulbasar make an appearance or charmander might come back.
А бульбазавр то с чего реинкарнировал?!
I love this series
It is sad that Charmander die, like my childhood has gone. Well Charmander had killed a lot of Caterpie, I hope Squirtle will be just like him, destroy the slavery culture, kill Pokemons, make friend.
You’re literally making me cry with a story you really want to make your favorite characters have to die by the stupidest little thing I am literally making me cry I am really know‘s😭
This came out 2 months ago and I missed it...I THOUGHT I CHECKED LAST MONTH AND IT STILL WASN'T HERE...better late than never, cool surprise for January 1st
Make squirtle meet diagla and time travel back in time to save charmander and bulbasaur
Super op
When will the next episode be aired?
So charmader is dead
Bro at this rate I will die before you finish all the episodes
: D how did i miss this
8,06  it's me , I can't belive that actually happened holly shit
I am guessing Bulbasaur also lost when the forest was destroyed and the worms that were feeding him were all destroyed as well.
Everyone predicting Squirtle will get Dialga/Palkia to rewind time and save Charmander. Am I the only one who thinks the next episode will follow Bulbasaur and perhaps Whiskers (who seemed to want vengeance on Bluey for killing Leonard) saying she would remember it? Also a stone was mentioned, indicating Caterpie could have evolved her. Maybe she's taken the stone for herself and is now a Nidoqueen. It's not the Everstone as Squirtle didn't have that when Caterpie set him free, and Nidorina wouldn't need an Everstone.
Dude a lame squirtle evolved into a warotle yes but it's like you turned him into a god!
Damn this is sad
I have waited for 2 months and no response yet
Caterpie at end: oh uh I mean I’m sorry hehehe Charmander: YOU LET ME DOWN *kills* Bulbasaur: *vine whipes* Caterpie:  aaaargh
I hate squitrle beacuase charmander fight to dead for squitrle and squitrle  it is worst
Make more please
Pls make more
You have been doing this for eight years:/
R.I.P Charmander
Omg omg omg omg it’s here
Way
I missed charmander
I’ve started watching entire series and I now know how it’s going to end Squirtle is going to beat up dialga then he’s going to make it go back in time safe Charmander then go to The cave where Mewtwo is at and fix the glitch
...am I the only one that is disappointed
MAKE HEM FASTER
It hurt to see charmander’s severed head on caterpie.
his name is turtwig
Wow. This was good and all but you killed off Charmander.... I couldn't even enjoy this episode. It ruined everything you done on past episodes. GG lost a fan
I didint like this episode because i really miss charmander and the series is kinda boring without him
11 ?
I want Charmander back
I want Charmander bag
Make episode 11
since this may or may not be the last episode, c yall in 2 years
Next ep is next year
Did charmander die
24:14 (dont mind this, i just put it here)
Don’t know how I missed mewtwo the first time through though I honestly feel bad for mewtwo’s bad luck with events
Now 3 years more for next episode
What if caterpie learned fire move and evolved into a rayquaza????????
What if caterpie was the god
I hope caterpie dies
WAIT WHAT IF THE SNOW TREE GUARDIAN WAS TRYING TO PROTECT POKEMON WHAT IF THE GOD WAS THE THING MEWTO FIGHTING......
WAIT CHARMANDER IS GOING TO BE SAVED?
Bro this is dark as fuck
Squirtle is gonna inslave mew two go back in Time save charmander and kill all of the catterpee
I miss charmander he was my favorite
i feel like the actual reason squirtle had the everstone was because charmander never made it to charmeleon
Where’s my boy Pippy I must know
1000 Like for seson 2 Attack of the weedil i gess becouse caterpie weedil you know or some other worm pokemon
Why is there mewtwo in 12:51
So shippidigge didn't said it so I am saying from this episode (episode 10) season 2 starts litteraly it feels like season two started from this episode so it did
If the war was over and done with. Doesnt it seem rather odd that it didnt show what happened to Bulbasaur in the end....i mean if he had such a good deal in the end like if he died to or moved on?
Omg it’s here
This was… amazing.. :( more MORE PLEASE
SHEEEESH!
How could an ice type kill a fire type?
You miss one episode and it becomes God Of War. *Sigh* Why not?
He didn't cry during the titantic? Do men even have feelings?  Me at the flashback:
This whole series was a wild ride, can't believe every episode had me at the edge of my seat. Great job on the awesome animations 👍
BRING BACK CHARMANDER
This was so good
Wonder what happened to balbsuar when he didn't want to leave
Can you all imagine that this all started 8 years ago 8 BROOO
This is the most tragin nuzlocke I've ever experienced
Why did this take so long to do
I been waiting for this for about 1 year
Keep up the great work
Do I have to wait a decade this time
Your all videos are great you are the best animator ever in YouTube
:DDDDDD
why did Charmander have to die
keep up the good work😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 wow it was so good
because of the glitches everything is going back in ep 12 where charmander remembers everything and is at the part when golem is killing butter free and then wartortle sees charizard and its him
Bro am so excited for the 11 ep
Hey there! Could you make blue shell man guy  (EP11,12 and 13) please ?? :)
I can't wait for the next one especially because of how great this one was
I already have a team
I can't wait for the next episode. It is an epic, heart wrenching story. Time travel also looks better. Charmender shouldn't remain dead. He should wake up soon. Please make the episode soon.
This is incredible !
The next part plissss ep 11
ep.12 idea. they can just probably stitch up charmander and to think of it they have revie so just use that
What happened to charmander
Can we pls have a part 11
ill be back in 5 years
Calling it now. Charmander is gonna come back as a Gastly.
I love this series
Will wartirtle make it to the top? Find out in the next episode of pokèmon starter squad
*_Dramatic flashback happening_* "Is he havin a flashback?" "Hold on I'll ask him" "Hey, are you havin' a _flashblack?_ "
Honestly , great job but all this time for just this , meh
So he's in the sinnoh region now huh? Where the legendaries are master of time and space and creation And the literal God is also found here. The only reason of this time skip I could possibly see is as its gonna change something in the past.....
i like wen he wins
Mede more episodes 11
Me to
“IM A BIRD, TWEET TWEET!” I love this line
I want charmender comeback
I hope the legendary Time pokemon brings Charmander backk he was my fav character
it went from the first series and now this is just dark
I like the reaction of snover when squirtle said “What is that”   “That is snow.” It killed me.
I love this one
Squirtle behind the scenes: *Silently watches his gen z memes*
8:55
O shi forgot to subscribe after all these years
Please hurry and post the next episode, I've literally been waiting forever.
Make episode 11 please
Part 11 please
jesus, wartortle was so fricking deep, i wonder how deep blastoise is gonna be in his voice
I miss charmander
What heppen to charmender ?😨😨😢😢😞😞
Join my cult ritual to revive Charmander.   WHY KILL HIM OF HES THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE FIRST EPISODES
Please keep this going. I really enjoy episode 1 through 10. I love it so much.
This is like deltarun snow grave route
Well that’s great that squirrel that’s about to his second person but what about Charmander is he still alive or is he Dead
Okay, this is just THE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I guess we have to wait another 3 years for the next episode
This was definately worth the wait
please please make (Ep.11) i beg of you shippiddge please😅
Mewtwo is still fighting unknown
i have a teory, Missingno have the power to glitch the space time, maybe mewtwo use the power of missingno to turn charmander back to life. (IT'S A TEORY)
I remember watching episode 9 a year ago and thinking charmander  would evolve and not die or something 😭
Can’t wait for episode 11!! I’m wondering where the heck did bulbasaur go? Did he die or move on and evolved?
I think squirtle is the bad guy. 1) It killed Pokémon from orders from a caterpillar yes a caterpillar. 2) It stopped  a god guardian. That guardian could of got killed by the gods for losing to a wartortle. 3) He’s a  rebel. 4) He killed his best friend. I do like the series it’s just it kinda feels like before episode 10 squirtle has changed a lot ( This isn’t a hate comment I still watch the series and like it it’s just an opinion so please don’t hate me)
Never mind I know what happened to him
OK but what happens to bobasour
When is ep 11 coming out I’ve been waiting for so long
When is ep11 gonna come out?
I want charmander and bulbasaur to come back and befriend the gen 4 starters. If dialga can bring back time it can be possible
I waited years this and it was every bit worth it
Each episode just keeps getting better and better! I actually love the choice to not save charmander, that would have been kind of lame since that's what always happens. Now squirtle is such a badass character. I guess he was always kind of the main character being the starter chosen in episode 1. Damn, this is definitely up there in some of the best pokemon fan made animation ever with Rubyer and Golder! It's crazy to think I watched this over 8 years ago in elementary school when the video first blew up, and how we've all grown. This comment slowly changed from me just admiring the artist to now reflecting on the passage of time and my life now. Kinda like how the show was just a funny animation that wasn't supposed to be taken seriously at all, but then became so much more than a joke about the starters and playing out of turn. Truly a work of art that was worth the wait. Thank you shippiddge ❤
I wonder where bulbasaur and the catarpie are now?
i love the fact that snover can just evolve into obomasnow and be just as terrifying as that massive thing
Amazing and I can see future plots and arcs in the work. (Whiskers becoming Nidoqueen and attacking Squrtile and the gods either being a joke or Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina)
I’m so sad that charmender died 😣😣 but this was so good
Pls make ep 11
Squirtle got such a nice personality glow up and even then he was already good. I love the design for bidoof! Kind of sad that turtwig left... I kinda liked him... Also it has been so so long since I watched this!!! Love your new art style!!! Stay safe! My sister thought you died for some reason.
War turtle is going to go back in time to save Charmander and then Charmander evolves into Charmeleon
Turquoise
Its is so good can wait for 2030 for the finale
u m i think the next episode is in some months
and now to wait another year
Finally I'm waiting so fucking long
Maybe squirtle and bulbasaur will die and then they will meet back up with charmander in the after life
Things would be different if char knew that Pablo was Caterpie’s brother
Squirtle will turn back to a prevolve and bring back charmander and bulbasaur
E11 when
we need episode 11
I found Chicken under my bed
this is cool,sad,funny, and interesting
Is charmander gonna be back or sum or not :(
make them faster slowpoke >:c
When's the next episode coming out
This is op where will be the next part will come
Wait, then charmander is just deid??????????!!!!!!!!!! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
12:50 not the universe dying
Pls another part as fast as you can pls
Something I noticed: When Caterpie tells Whiskers she's "Not ready for the stone" you might think he means the Everstone charm. BUT Caterpie never gave Squirtle the Everstone, he doesn't have it when they part ways. SO it's more likely that Caterpie has a moonstone which he was going to use on Whiskers, but wanted to be sure she was 100% obedient, as a Nidoqueen could easily crush him.  I'm thinking Whiskers didn't die, and instead may have left and taken the Everstone. Perhaps later, after Caterpie gave up the war, she went back for Bulbasaur and is seeking vengeance on Squirtle for killing Leonard. She's a ground type so a grass type would be useful for battling Squirtle. I think we will see Nidoqueen and Bulbasaur/Ivysaur next episode (he could have evolved as it's been 20 yrs).
Whay shuld charmander die 😭😭😭😭
Don't make a finale plz it is so entertaining
OH CRAP SQUIRTLE WENT GOD MODE
Mega Obamasnow
When is the next episode?
Shit gotta wait one more year damn it
The first 9 episodes were season one and now it is season two
i love these viedos
Whiskers saying she “won’t forget” seems like a bad omen for the future. But damn this series is so good. I am curious if the whole storyline with meeting Mewtwo at Cerulean Cave will continue or if Charmander’s death marked the end of that. Guess we will have to see in the final 2 episodes!!
Ok that was very epic
Size doesn’t matter snow way
In the next episode can charmander be in it
Next episode plz have crmader
I love your videos
Plz more
Wenn Charmander gonna be  back ??
waiting for part 11
Man, time flies. I remember watching the first episode when I was eight. I'm sixteen now.
whst happen to bulbasaur
Rest in peace Charmander
Ok... Then let's wait for 3-4 years for the ep 11
I'll tell you who didnt get a happy ending. Us. Old cast was better and that was the story we got after the wait? Garbage fire.
I wonder what happened to bulbasaur
12:51 what the
See look at the size they're lighter than before this before he had the gem
Oh and BTW I feel like Squirtle eyes are much more darker it's like he's having flashbacks of his own memories just like me
I feel like that caterpillar needs to die hopefully she does and never comes back what she needs to do Squirtle you had multiple times to kill her why didn't you
Summons all the memories and all the remains of Charmander attack ghostly Charmander glow blast
Squirtle you butthole left him there wow such a great friend that happened to you exactly
GREAT JOB
squrtle just went like this 🙂-> 👿
holy sh## this is amazing more episodes please you better or elsse fbi open up
Charmander and Bulbasaur you will always be remembered…. BOOHOO!! *Starts crying* 😓😣😖😫😭😭😭🥺😢
i forgot this series even existed until a month after this was released damn
Charmander was my favorite :(
well then- that was depressing
Well... that was absolutelly awesome. The story evolving like that was absolutelly unexpected, you people are killing it with this :D
Please bring charmander and bulbasaur
...now THATS A ANIMATION
I miss charmander please bring him back somehow :(
Valerio a viso un Pokèmon

Waiting for episode 11
R.i.p charmander
Wow I’m so happy it’s back!
okay listen up  turtwig mentions squirtle to be level 98 before evolving (doing so by gaining a level) and becoming level 99  IT CAN AND PROBABLY WILL STILL EVOLVE (otherwise, why would he mention 98 exactly) :OOO
wow.. good choice in having a Warturtle to continue this story.. it is stated in the dex that it is wise.
yehey.. been waiting for along tie for this
I miss charzard
I wish charmander wasn't dead
This is actually a really good series lmao. Keep it up
Bruh this went from a comedy of starter pokemon getting into shenanigans to fucking war crimes and despair wtf.
tvh i wish charmander was still here... i LOVED the character SOOO MUCH
Getting charmander vibes.
16:07 “Aruseusu” Not even Pokémon know the correct pronunciation of arceus.
1 year later... Starter Squad ep. 11

Can you do the legend of orange lizard
Squirtle: well looks like its time to get my life together  Squirtle: Donezo Stick: But all you did was put a decorative rug ove-  Squirtle: Donezo Stick: ...
I thought charmander lived
The writing in this show keeps getting better and better
Wartortle is so underrated I’m hype with the way he was portrayed in this masterpiece of an episode
but you cant just kill off charmander like that so early thats bullshit
He tried to save Chinchar
No
I actually thought charmander was going to be the main character (at least the most focused on in the group).
alfin saliooo TT_TT graciass pense que ya no sacarias TT_TT  amo tu serie XD
Squirtle has a point about evolving but if you do evolve you get stronger and stronger and thats how you grow!
He became god of war hahaha
New episode plssssss guyyy
I would like to know what happened to the bread bulbasaur?
This series is one of the best i have seen. Pokemon for adults...Though the basic concepts of Pokemon were never for kids if you really break it down.
I love how mewtwo is still trying to get rid of missingno
Pls episode 11
What happened to bulbasour
Nice
Ayo?? Found this by chance in my recommended and didn’t expect this to be as good as it is!  Started goofy like DBZA, it’s ending with giving me a REAL interest and attachment here! Binged it in one night and I’m sad it’s ending :P
🥰
We need him to turn in to blastios
Nooooooooooooooooo Charmander
I was taking the ACT and crap so I was hoping somebody else would mention this question but legit no one did so-  We still don't have the most important question answered yet tho!!  *Is the Caterpie leader a boy or a girl?*
👌
if charmader dont come bake i am going to cry
"If I'm gonna make bad choices, they're gonna be my own."  LOL.
Is it me or do the snover sound like a group of sassy and over friendly Pokemon?
that was so long for it to come out
It was fantastic and  i am so glad that i am alive to see this
he's currently a level 99 wartortle so... is blastoise going to take on arceus? 👀
Add charmander back somehow he op
Snover is easily my favorite pokemon character in all of canon plus fan based lore because of this video.
please make Charmander live again in the next eps!!!
Make charmander Alive and envolved to charizard mega
Dud... Charmander is ded? ; - ;
bulbasaur and charmander death??
Its been a month I dont have many days to live I am getting old😂😂. But seriously please upload more episodes
Always remember turtwig I hate you both more than you will ever know  (No one will ever respect youuuuu)  This is gold
So maybe he will battle the gods and travel back in time to save charmander and bulbasaur and head to cerulean cave to meet mewtwo and defeat missinggno and travel again Across the regions
What happens in episode 11
OK WHY IS Charmander DED
Wait, so when he says "bulbasaur didn't want to leave" did he just stay there by charmander an wait to die with him?
Yes the next episode yesssss
Well i will wait 3 years for the next episode
OMG SO COOLLLLL O:
Cant wait for Blastoise to be introduced to be Squirtle's dad and said "Remember Squirtle, dying is gay" then Squirtle just evolves again.
MAKE ANOTHER EPSSODE AND MAKE THE POKEMON GOD GARINTINA AND MAKE HIS NEW FRIENDS RABOOT AND THE MID GRASS TYPE STARTER IN GALAR PLEASE
2:34 a smash bros reference

Honestly found this and watched it in a day, really impressive animation quality and premise overall, hoping you head back to missingno eventually :D
LETS GOOOO
I think Squirtle will talk to Palkia and Dialga and will get sent back in time to fix his biggest mistake. I was sure the episode would end on that actually.

Noooo charmander
Monkey is techno blade
I agree Chimchar but his voice is god awful.
#snovergang let’s make this a thing
I like how he is slowly turning into charmander and still holding his grudge about charmander
Is charzard coming back?
So Squirtle turned into Kratos after Charmander's death? Cool.
Noooooooow charmander :'(
I'm so sad that Charmander died I thought that the Caterpie would die not Charmander!  how though Charmander has a huge type advantage.
is this….the end?

Gotta wait another 2 years for episode 11
I loved the quick mewtwo scene
Ok. So... Charmander is dieded, and Bulbasaur is being lunch while eating lunch. So if Charmander was dieded, then he is that Gastly back at Pokémon tower that’s always like...            BLAHRGH
Aw man i felt sad for charmander's horrible destiny at least squirtle is now a free pokemon
I really wanna see charmander back, it feels kinda different with just squirtle. Like, cmon dude. it's the STARTER squad. If you could tell people's opinions without having fights, I kinda hate this newer episodes, I would dislike this but hey, my opinion. It's okay if you like it anyway.
i want charmander back :(
Charmander died F
11
Good writing! Can't wait for episode 11!
NOOOO CHARMANDER
Yey
I miss charmander.....
2><
Mising know and mew 2?!?
Dude did i just watch and learn the true meaning of "WARTORTLE" name was is "GOD OF WAR"?? Its way more cooler than Kratos. Looking forward for its sequel tho.
wating 1 year for this,finally
Theory: In Episode 11 We get a flashback when Caterpie tried to stab Charmander but Charmander dodged it and ran away.
I am really  sad for charmmander
What happened to charmander and bulbasaur?
Kratos???
We want carmander back with his evolution
yayyyy after 1 year of waiting we finally get........ 1 episode????? ummmm yeah 10 down after 10 years .........yahooooooo
please also release the 11th episode and also release this series as a youtube featured web series
damn i been wait for so long just for charmander to be dead \
Did charmander and bulbusar get reincarnateD?
Long live my Charmander
Finally got the time to watch this and it was all worth the wait. Great job to everyone who worked on this. If only Nintendo could hire such talented young minds like yourself who make great fan projects, but alas, it feels like a pipe dream of mine.
wait is chimchar charmander and turtwig bulbasaur?
3:13
16:09 If you see the translations, and the way he proununces it. It's Arceus obviously
I disliked this one make charmander and babasaur come back there so good
I can't wait to have a TORTANK !!!!!!!!!
When Wartortle obtains a revive
Why did it have to end on a cliffhanger. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
Bring back charmander
What happened to ball as ur and charmander
What happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur?
Please do part 11 and 12 please
Go Warturtle
Squirtle was really a cheat. When charmander wanted to save him from those caterpies, he fought from their side and betrayed charmander that got charmander killed. And now what is he doing,he is also doing the same as charmander,trying to save chimchar. I hate squirtle for this.
Plis sube el video número 11
I HATE THIS WHY DID CHARMANDER HAVE TO DIE ITS SO DUMB CHARMANDER WAS THE MOST LIKED CHARACTER I UNSUBBED
PLZ PLZ PLZ MAKE CHARMANDER COME BACK PLZ
great video. I do wish it was a little bit more comedy based but still fun to watch
This is the first episode I’ve seen of this series and I’m already invested lol
I felt so bad for Charmander.
ep. 11 or season 2 when?... cuz im lovin this kind of vid even tho its a lil bit sad..keep up the good work
We waited 2 years for this. Was it worth it? The answer: Yes
i hope they make ep 11 in 2022

Make more bro i wanna watch more!!
This is probably the most sickest episode of the series
Oh my little treelings
My question is the bidoof shiny?
I NEED THE LAST TWO PARTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Charmander died no Wait where is Bulbasaur
It kinda seems like squirtle has PTSD from being a soldier in the caterlie war and now he's lashing out because he just followed and couldn't save his friends.
Can't wait for episode 11
Wut happen to charmandar
the end has me laughing alll this all has me crying part 11
I kinda wish Charmander made a bug appearance at the end...
RIP Charmander
Do you does anyone think this is the last episode
What time squirrels was the main character I thought Charl meant it was
I hope charmander comes back somehow
This is what the pokemon franchise needs, this!!!
Charmander... Died?

oh my god i feel so bad for squirtle  THIS SHOW IS WEIRDLY AMAZING
R.I.P to the following: Charmander Bulbasaur Piplup Chimchar
can we just agree that snow is a dynamax abomasnow?
*WARNING*  *Spoiler alert*    Ok, I litterally cried over Charmander. He was the best character. But I gotta say, iam pretty scared of where this lore will take us. I hope they like revive Charmando some time.
Love it
After 10 years, squirtle is still a squirtle
it was so sad and i cry and crid and at the end he said something idk what to say :0 can u make part 11 pls! its so good!will if u didnt.... idk if u did do 11 or not idk random i guess am not really ur fan so ya
when episode 12 comes out i will be done watching the whole tiktok for you page
I'm still sad that character died
2:15 Squirtle Comes
ep.11 when?
What happened to the humor? I thought this was supposed to be a comedy series.
please make episode #11 AND 12 COME SOONER
Also me after squirt le evolves: noooo I want the old squirtle backkkkk why does these episodes get worse and worse-
Nooo I wanna have charmander backkkkk
I’m pissed that charmander is dead…
Damn cant wait for this son of a b squirtle evolve to a fricking blastoise
Finally it’s back again
Where's charmander?
😥😥charmander died
finally  I've been waiting for a long time!
Get him to 1 million subs
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥🏒
My fhone's kinda laggy
Bring back charmander
Seeing charmanders head there is pretty much yikes he is dead. So yep. Charmander is officially Dead. R. I. P His Empathy.
I hope bulbasaur and charmander come back
This made me emotional.
Where is Charmander   this video
I want charmander to still be alive on the blink of death
🙁🙁🙁😢😢😢
finnaly 10
Snover guys were my absolute favorite.you gotta put them in the next one!
Damn i just saw mewtwo fight missingno
You can't literally beat legendaries and mythicals bro they do insane damage Also I think Arceus can defeat this guy cuz he's unbeatable
No way I didn’t think it would ever be made
mewtwo was in a flashback in the forest when the caterpie was talking to squirtle about killing the other one
Thank youuuuuuu a year of wait is really worth it
Uhm where's bulbasuar
make the others get revived!
Thank you for continuing the series!
he should have evolved into blastoise because pokemon with 3 evoluions usually evolve 1st at level 20 then evolve again at level 50
This has been going on for eight years and we’re finally at episode 10
Are we gonna wait another year for the next episode though?..
because if they are goddamn why
is the og starter squad dead?
if charmander died i do not like this series
Yay what a long wait
OMG I waited for 1000 years
If another 2 more it would take another year for 11?
Imma miss charmander lol
You did a outstanding job bro you gatta keep going you need to start doing seasons 🔥🔥
Now how the hell is charmander gonna be replaced when a different  char doesn't  know wartortal
FINALLY!!!
What’s the song in the beginning
what happended with charmander and ulbusore
....
I LOVE THE SNOWERS LOL
I have  watched  this video 100 times
I hate why this is so underrated
Only 2 more episodes left episode 11 on 2025 episode 12 on 2030
Charmender should come in next part
after all this time. I wish Charmander got a good ending, its unfortunate.
where is ep 11
Make Charmander become a demon and he is on top of mountain
wow this series became crazy
Glad I remembered this
It toke you like 10 years
Aren't those bidoofs?
I want to see charmander  see evolve
brooooooooo i what more ep
Is episode 11 coming next. Also there is no beaver society
12:51 is mewtwo fight and missingno
22:42 POV: The way more skilled toxic player tryed to clap me after I got my pizza rolls.
Sadly charmander is dead  😢
BRING CHARMANDER BACK
The way caterpie released Squirtle and stopped calling him bluey is quite touching
there will be a ep 11?
where charmelion n bulbasaur
not bad
WHAT THE FU-
Omg
I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT WHAT ON CHARMANDERS KILLED BACK SAYS IT SAYS VICTORY TGAT MEANS THEY KILLED THE LIZARD OR MEWTO REVIVE HIM OR SQUIRTLE GOES BACK TO SAVE FRIM STOPING CATERPIE KILLING CHARMANDER OR  that the only option OR WHAT COULD IF the funny facts would squirtle poke the charmandee hat?
Aww I liked charmander :(
OH NO I NOTICED NOOOOO CHARMANDER

I don't remember a thing from the last 9 episodes
Disappointing conclusion :/
ya ep 10
Where is charmander
2 more? The last one better be squirtel charmander and bulbasaur to be reincarnated or something for a nice ending
Episode 10 was so awesome, I love self you're really episode 11 keep up the good work
22:00 'Then you have chosen death' The origins of that meme
8:41 make sense in the games if you have the everstone I think it's called if your Pokemon is passed it's  evolution point. It's a bit stronger
Do episode 11 please its been 1 month since I checked
It’s really good But really sad Lol 😂
FINALLY THE 10EPS
Without charmander it´s not good anymore
22:00 _A wild meme template appeared!_
Squirtle really needs a hug. He's been through a lot. Absolutely LOVING these episodes, by far my favorite pokemon show (and i mean over the actual anime too). You and your team are doing an absolutely amazing job, Shippiddge. Really hope these characters get a happy ending!
I miss charmender
The moment it became god of war
You know,.... dialga exist, so .... we can still revive charmander, i mean i dont really like how it ended, like it s so sad
New episode!
Holy shit that's edatlin as Snover
the tree dying like : WHAT THE FU-
Charmander :(
did this turn into god of war?? XD
bro when will u upload episode 11
that was amazing
Starting to have squirtle to be honest
YES i honestly thought there wasnt going to be anymore
22:56 This reminds me of Squirtle did the WWE  John Cena slam.
I love/hate that Squirtle looks kind of elderly........
Man the wait is over :) waiting from years!!
Where bulbasaur
I have a feeling bluey is gonna ask "the gods" to revive char and put the old Charmanders memories into him
I didn’t know it was already here; and it’s been a month already! Last time I made a joke saying ep. 10 would be released when I had kids. Guess what? I got pregnant, had my kid, about 9 months old now, and somehow while I was watching another thing on YouTube he put this video. I had to leave this comment as soon as I could, as a reminder.
we need more
Ep 11 soon?
I miss Charmander...
I know squirtle probably found chimchar and turwig but if it was the sinnoh starter team first    WHAT HAPPENED TO PIPPLUP
Reincarnation of charmander and bulbasaur????????? Please someone tell me
Yes episode 10!!!!
Yes episode 10!!!!
Anyone else think Chimchar sounds like a girl??? I'm just gonna think she's a girl in my head canon
Thai is the real Mega Abomasnow
Only 5 or 6 more years and the series will be complete.
gonna call it now, Charmander is gonna be revived by mewtwo
Charmander is %100 dead
Bruh i was expecting a longer wait but damn this was released quickly
Imagine That When He's Finally at The Top a Staircase Well Randomly Show and above The Stairs Is Arceus The god Of Pokemon's
Wait wtf Charmander died I thought he was The Main Character!
Took him long enough
Where is  the episode 11 and 12:(
Were is episode 11 and 12
Sad that Charmander is dead
Squirtle was playing god of war when fighting abomasnow
Can't wait to watch episode 11 after buying gta 6
NOOOO! CHARMANDER DIE?!! NOOOOO! NOOOOOO!!
Final legend is back
NO I WANTED TO SEE SUPA COOL ULTRA GOD KILLER IN ACTION
I want to see Alolan Sandslash up on that mountain.
I dont know this but how much time does he take ti produce 1 amazing episodes
The absolute violence of Snow’s death was hilarious, the WHAT THE FU-
waiting for the last 2
Loved your incredible video  ✨😊

Is gonna part 11 come out????
It fi
I love the God of war references
This is dark my heart fell when they killed charmander its dark
F*cking finally!! An amazing series no doubt! But it took way too long!
what song reorsences war torrtles life                   ALONE AGAIN ALONE AGAINNNNNNNNNNN ALONE
Guys squirtle is coming to get charmender back cuz in the boss fight it said god of time and space so squirtle is getting charmender to be alive the gods might be dialga and palkia
Yes I missed you posting vids
This series is beyond amazing. Shippiddge has created something unique...  Now, regarding speculation about what's about to come: If you watch carefully at the drawings on the wall on episode 9, you will see that there is Squirtle, Wartortle and Caterpie about to stab Charmander. So Shippiddge has already decided on what will come next years ago. Also, if you search for the Japanese name of the god that "Snow" mentions, it is Arceus.  So I suppose that Wartortle will talk with Arceus and will be sent back in time so that he can rescue Charmander and go and find Mewtwo afterwards to destroy the glitch/Missigno
Also bring charmander back he is my favorite starter and my 1st.
Brings me back to when I got diamond version around christmas as a kid, my starter was chimchar my other favorite is turtwig.
Did anyone saw mewtwo fighting that corrupted thing?
Come on pls upload the whole series at once plzzzzzz ☺️☺️😜😜🥺🥺
Sad ending😭😭😭
Did he go doomslayer?
Yasss
what did you do to charmander!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Snowvert is now my favorite pokemon
Human human human human
Flashbacks always happens well not to me lol
Will the next episode come in 2022??
PLEASE WE NEED EPISODE 10
Ooh maybe he’s gonna ask arceus or mewtwo or whatever for charmander to come back
🥺😢😭 charmander noooooooooooooooo
Happy to finally watch this episode... but really, really sad... to know that this episode is extremely likely to be last one, 10 years to make this one....   i hope someone else can take this job and work with shippiddge if possible
This may seem a bit out of the blue, but could it be that Charmander is now a Gastly? I remember when Haunter told him, "This is what you'll turn into when you die." This would be hilarious, just imagine: Squirtle mourning him, refusing to evolve ect. all while Charmander enjoys his (un)life as a Gastly.  One day, Wartortle revisits Lavener Town and suddenly "Bah!", a Lv. 80 Gengar shows up. Gengar gives Wartortle a hell of a ride, torturing him, confronting him with his worst fears. But Wartortle knows that voice, that behaviour. "Charmander, is that you?"
a 98 lvl wartortle sure be op
I honestly hate squirtle after what he did to charmander
FINALY! A NEW EPISODE!! Man That SlowPoke Really took long enough.
Awww wtf charmander died??? Wack
Song:  Finally, i have been waiting for eternity. come to me come to me, ep10 i have been waiting for the years 🎶 the two episodes, the two episodes i have been waiting. But no more.  End  You can use this song shipiddige
Remember: 1.  Do not question beaver society. 2.  Name things after their purpose. 3.  Don't tap the reserves. 4.  Tap the reserves.
I have a v calyrex rainbow card and a Raichu GX rainbow card and mewtwo rainbow card wow
It's really sad that charmander did change at the end but squirtle was so blind to see it.
So is charmander ded
Live on squirtle as wartortle go see the pokegods and show them you’re the man
Aw what you actually killed charmander? Bruh
YOOOOO IT CAME OUT?!?!
Can you make part 11 with Charmander Bulbasaur
I wish I could of got the Pokémon of pokemon shield and sword
Wow this episode nice make episode 11
What happened to charmander
😭😭😭
Please, please… PLEASE, tell me Charmander is alive.
Hay man can you make the next part when your ready I NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPPENS
DAMN CLIFF HANGERS
This is sad man I was a little bit disappointed that charmander is dead but then realised how good this episode was it really shows us how much emotional pain squirrel has went through charmander was only trying to help his freind but was killed by him in the process. To think this used to be a funny animation with some pokemon is mind blowing.
It be pretty cool if Charmander gets revived by a revival stone
Plz part 11
So Charmander really died?! Sad 😔
What year is it
We’re is the real charmandr
Mewtwo is still chasing error hitmonchan 12:46
I want charmander to be main character rip charmander he could have meet mewtwo
Woww such a good storyline man ( ◜‿◝ )♡( ◜‿◝ )♡( ◜‿◝ )♡( ◜‿◝ )♡ and i like blastoise (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
Hollow
Awww man we’re is Charmander
Yes I have beeen waiting for so long
That's it this is not freaking nice this is about war now now I want to kill those worms Charmander it's a dragon and I like dragons and he is dead and he turned it to a hat now I want to turn them into a billion of hats one by one and even all smash them on a wall I made is called the spike wall full of poisonous spikes you will die when you get stabbed and you will die at heaven for God's sake heck of giving up poo God God Jesus God Jesus oh my God Jesus Christ of God please for God grace is a carnitive card of shoes and she gosh I am now hating Pokemon so much now or maybe choose Charmander first
How have I literally never heard of this series until now? This silly joke turned into such a great series. This episode was so well done.
Best ever pokemon series... 👍 👍 👍 👍✨
I found this at the star of the year and randomly though “huh, maybe it will be out by now”
Can someone give me the full end credits music?  (It’s this music btw 24:39)
What tha heck  Wartortle are not that op
Ep 11 please
Give next video
I did not know it was realeased I already subscribed you an turned on the notifications hiw was not it working. Iam waiting for 11 and 12
Anime rage power up
Is Char ment to be a equivalent of charmander. And the other Pokémon (don’t know his name) ment to be an equivalent of Balbasaur?
He's going full corpse husband mode when blastoise comes around
after years its finally back btw been watching since 2017
If you really think about it...it's kinda sad.
Is Bulbasaur still alive
Charmander die 😣
where is charmander ?
Bruh when squirtle evolves I got so sad remembering that that was all that charmander wanted other than his friends.
While Hollywood's big bucks are going to overhyped mediocre creations, these guys created this hugely enjoyable film (binge ep. 1-10). Storytelling masterpiece (plot and visuals). THANK YOU!   ... to think I got here while overhearing it while my 5 year old videosurfed. He's asleep and I couldn't stop watching.
Wartortle will probably have Dialga send him back in time and he will save Charmander, be devolved, as to not be too OP, and prevent the war
can you make charmander came back to life
Finaly thank you very much for ep 10
Where is Charmander and Bulbasaur🥺
Please bring back Charmander Charmander can evolve into Charizard or Charmeleon plees
ep 11?
Wait......did Charmander die!
I was watching ep.nine and was like thank goodness there is a ep.ten
plss make more🥺🥺
I have a theory, so since it seems we're in gen 4 right now, either palkia or dialga will be in the mountain. (Or both) and since one of them can stop time and the other can go back in time, they will send wartorltle back in time to stop caterpie from killing charmander. Or arceus will be in the mountain and do (something)
But isn't there 2 episodes left?
What app are you using plz tell me
I know it's is sad and all but tell me there is a new episode coming and this time it won't take more than two years 🥲
Make more videos
2 more?
plss bring charmander back in ep 11
THIS WAS EPIC
Man Squirtle being directly responsible for Charmanders death is heavy
When is ep 11 im  exited
Rip Charmander
My favorite character was charmander I’m sad he died
this is a super good animation man
Finally
Coming to think about it, charmander wasn’t really a very good Pokémon, killing a majority of caterpies, but I’m just kind of sad that he’s gone.
Human Human Human…Humaaan!!!!
i waited years for a new episode
NOOOOOOOOOO
Hey man please can you ad charmender like he is alive and kill that insect in next 2 episode and in ep 11 you can evolve charmender to charmeleon please and in ep 12 last episode you can evolve charmeleon into the charizard please 😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😭😢😢😭😭😢😢 please ppppppppppplllĺlllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeee please please please please please
Did charmander
А можно по русски
Wheres his giant canons
12:51 just a normal battle with missingno and mewtwo
Theory: Chimchar didn’t die, I think that because at the end when he was bringing him up, the chimchar had the color of a shiny, and the chimchar warortle knows is not a shiny, does that mean the original chimchar is alive?
That was really good one of the best videos I've ever watched on YouTube 🔥 I've been watching this series since I was little, only two episodes left wish there was more 🥲
Rest and piece rip
Been here since the beginning
De verdad sois increíbles! Llevaba mucho esperando este capítulo 😍😍😍
MAKE CHARMANDER BACK TO LIFE NOW I LOVED THIS SHOW

Finally

What happen to Charmander and Bulbasaur
Wow, Chimchar was a pussy. His opponent had *QUAD WEAKNESS* to fire!
sad
A kde je Piplup? 👁️👁️
I can't wait for ep11 in 2023
Awesome video Shippiddge you are the best YouTuber ever and my favorite YouTuber of all time
I hate this.This is the worst series ever. You killed the best character and have replaced him with a monkey.this was my childhood and now I have considered to kill myself
oh charmander's dead
Well now all I can do is not ask for part 10 but part 11
bulbasaur and charmander look different from 10 days

¿Whats happend to bulbasaur?
Bring Charmander back!
SOOO COOL
Umm, where is charmander?
Op the last moment
I miss charmander :(

Hope the next ep cms
Where's Bulbasaur
22:58 it's the "WHAT THE F-" for me lmao
i want charmander backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me encantó por fa saca la parte 11
I really like when the snow monster says what the when wartrotle falls from the sky to kill him
Really. charmander was my favorite character
Meanwhile Mewtwo still waiting at Cerulean Cave
Dang RIP Charmander
Thang this should be on Netflix
Sooo specifically we know Squi....Wartortle is level 99 so Blastoise is coming.   Is Turtwig gonna come back?   Was bulbasaur that oblivious he died as food or did he wiggle away   Will Caterpie come back is they a butterfree now that it as grown as a person over 10 years   Where is Pidgeot he still getting bodied by poison types?  Is Whiskers dead or did she run away  Also I was waiting on the fake out of the Snowway monster just being a cowardly  Abomasnow with a big costume.  Actually got some action outta it so creative. Comedy in perfect spots. (Just because you're slightly bigger doesn't mean you stand a chance) I laughed but I can see an enemy saying that. This writing is amazing.  Well done well done always worth the wait
8:03 took me this long to find out and Turtwig is basically my inner voice 🤣
I wonder if  charzard is not really dead but great job with the animation ik these take a while
Ep1-8 funny&sometimes scary Ep9-10 just sad..
Las 2
I'm even more hype for the final episodes than before now
are we gona have to wait 2 years for the next 1? :{
Don't worry. Wartortle is going to see Arceus. He'll bring everyone back to life. Or maybe I'm in denial. Probably denial.
Now I gotta watch all the other episodes to re catch up OMG 🙄🙄😃😃😃😃😃
noooooooooooo porq charmander por q el , era el mas cabron y chingon de todos
Epic
the best 28 minutes and 16 seconds of my life
Please bring back charmandar
Wet is bobs or and Carmendr
Hey why charmender die i like charmender in series turn on the charmender again
RIP charmander, a really good character of this series🦎🔥
wait is charmander actually dead or did they kill a different charmander?
Bruh charmander died cmon man
This video was sad
Pls can you Make a episode it will reborn charmander?
Oh man!! This series is lot better than Journeys.
Cant wait for the other episodes. About did a really good job
So Squirtle is the Main Character now
Hello no no no no no no no no oh no oh no no no no no no no no no no no no
I'm sorry but I have to dislike this... I mean my favorite character Charmander is DEAD?! And this whole time I thought he was the main protagonist so sorry shippiddge also I'm not looking forward to the next episode.
This episode was 28 minutes and felt too short. Thats a mark of great storytelling. Not to mention the voices, animation, etc. Shocking amount of character/story development over the years, amazing series, cant wait to see the rest.
Thank you. Thank you for the best birthday gift. I was truly amazed by this.
So did charmander actually die? I was hoping I’ve would somehow survive 😭😭😭😭
For some reason I miss Charmander
This show really started 8 years ago
why charmander?!? :(
Why WHY!!! Did charmader die
piiiiiiieeeeezzzzzzzzzz  i wot mor nowwwwwww
Jesus christ I just realized it was two years ago that the last episode was released  Just you wait until it’s been two years since im this came out
This shit is so violent
Hi
Hi
I thought that squirtle would evolve into blastoise
It has been awhile
not even gonna lie best 28 minutes of my life. best
i miss charmander :(
Think that the god would be Charizard                        .............                        technical its not possible 😕😕😕
Big talk from the pokemon with the worst ever type combination LOL
Look, I appreciate this whole series and everything, but I will no longer be watching it after this episode. In my personal opinion, you took the worst possible route storywise. You can't just build up this great story through 9 episodes, and then right when it all comes to a head at the end of ep. 9, you just 1. Don't show any of what happens in said climax 2. Not show 2/3 characters we've gotten to know over this whole series ever again. 3. IMO unjustifiably kill of Charmander. I know that no one probably cares what I have to say, but I thought I'd give my two cents.
Squirtle said he’s gonna ask something. My theory is he is gonna ask to resurrect charmander and chimchar from the dead.
WE NEED CHARMANDER AND BULBASAUR BACK
wait whats going to be next?  I really want to see the next episode
Episode 11 please 😆😆😆
Where’s EPISODE 11 I want to watch moreeeeee
oh, now I know thanks
where di bulbasaur go?
To bro when is the new video comeing
Thank you so much for making these videos, they are the memories of my brother and I, your videos are why we start to be participated in the Pokemon world, really grateful for your work
I think in episode 11 or 12 wartortle might become blastoise
Wow, absolutely amazing. Love the future hint for some time-travel hijinks with the Mewtwo plant.
Ayo im there
Yep dude so much waiting
*Squirtle : God of Wartortle*
The only thing i dont like, was that Charmander and Bulbasaur died.
Plz not another 2 year wait
I think wartortle is going to talk to dialga and try to bring Charmander back to life
We waited 2 years for this ep :)
Cant wait for ep11
This.. Is the greatest thing I've ever seen....
PLSSS PUT CHARMANDER BACK I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
Noooo charmander :(
Wait....so....the whole Missingno Thing didn't matter? Cause mewtwo said to "meet him in cerulean cave", and, well, there's no way squirtle could have known about that, since charmander is dead and bulbasaur probably forgot. And 10 years passed without Missingno being a problem? Did mewtwo take care of him? If mewtwo could take care of him, why didn't he in Episode 8? All he did then was make it retreat, Given he said "you caused this you can fix it..", Implying he didn't actually kill it. What was the point of introducing a villain like that if you're not gonna do anything with him?
I still wonder why Mewtwo is still fighting Missingno after 10 years
Cant wait for ep 11
YES THANK YOU JESUS
Keeping this series is awsome i love this series 👍
Cadê o episódio 11
YOO I just notice the caterpie is wearing chamader’s head!
I love how this is perfectly timed with the release of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
Everyone’s asking about bulbasaur  Or piplup But not                                                                      Why you wasted your time looking at this comment
I can believe charmander is dead O:
I really want to hang out with the Snover 🤣 but man this episode was great! Can't wait for the next one 😆
Why a whole year make us wait
I miss charmamder
😂😂😂 yes!
Looks like digimon X evolutipn
12:50 oh hi mewtwo
Pls make more video
Its all warturtles fault if he didnt water guned charmendwr he had not done this
Wow Charmander went out in a really unfair way. He was tryna save his Squirtle but Squirtle got him killed. That is super unfair. Poor guy
hate to see charmander like that :( :'(
THAT WAS COOL
quartle evolved
Also, i just watched the 9 part series and now im sad that charmander died
Hey Where Are Those Dragon DID YOU KILL THEM Ship!
When can we expect the part 11 to come out
Finally yes
Were is bobozord
I am waiting for 11 and 12
is der more i want more
Not a single God of War comment......ima leave this right here
gonna wait another year for ep11
Where's charmander
I hate the fact charmander died
I waited so long for this
They’ve traveled so far, it started from squirtle getting chosen to fighting a literal god.
Where is Charmander?🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
this is... actually a fairly well made show the characters are so well written theres no clear good or bad side nothing here truly revolves around a main character, its like im watching something that really happened and by god, that voice acting. holy shit.  this is absolutely amazing, not even a joke
stover has been my favorite Pokemon for a while, now I love it even more
The Snover is peak comedy
Make ep11 with rayquaza
whens the next one coming out?
I'm glad Chimchar died. He is worse than Charmander. Charmander is annoying but I miss him.
I know that the final episode will be in 2 years.
oh shit episode 10 ..it's been so long i wasnt even sure this was new and I already forgot everything about the series except the smartass charmander - welp time to rewatch
This was a two year masterpiece also I love how squirtle looks tired
let's wait for 3 years for 11
WHY CHARMANDER WHY so sad im not even almost cried when i realized he died
Omg i’ve been waiting for decades to see this :0
Yes finally after a whole year of waiting
Squirtle is now a hardened solider suffering from ptsd.
Everyone gangsta until squirtle throws his everstone
I did not like this only the Last episodes
I dont like that charmander died
Finally, 2 years to see a new episode
i really like this series i just want to see the next one but have to wait
12:51 wth is that mewtwo
Please bring back Charmander and Bulbasur😥.
I love squirtle
Charmender 😢 fuck! Really die ?
So did charmander actually die
Where's bulbasaur🥺🥺🥺
I have been following this series since I was a kid now I'm a young teenager. I really love this series and I will never leave it!
plot twist: Charmander is the "god"
Arg vibes fr  can somone look into this
Aw man I enjoyed the old style is Charmander going be back?
Charmander dead 😭😭😭😭
Where's Bulba?
i was really hoping for charmander to somehow come back it was really sad how he died he was my favorite
this series came out a year ago? I’m so confused I watched this series so long ago      Edit: that was the 1 - 9 episode video that came out a year ago
Wait what happened to bulbasour?
i prefer this over that helluva boss show 😁
I think at the top it’s gonna be caterpie and Squirtle and Caterpie are gonna battle it out since we don’t know what happened to caterpie I think it’s returning episode 11 trying with new Pokémon and better Pokémon.
No score of the sauce to be a real friend Charmander did all of that for him and he watches and standby as he killed him
Chimchar is just like Charmander Charmander reborn
FINNALYYYYYYYYYY and wow kinda violent charmander died
I'm sad because Charmander died
Dude I just checked this out I’m some excited
I've been fucking waiting forever for this I can't wait to get off work tonight crack a beer and watch this THANK U SO FN MUCH
I love how the tree is still talking while wartortle is talking to dead char
I can't believe I've been watching this series for 8 years
The plot twist lizard survives and evolves to  Charzard and takes revenge
nooo i want to see my boy bulbasaur!
Wait so is charmander dead😭he was my favourite but I like chimchar's characteristics.. But wait what happened to bulbaseur then..?
i swear to god if u make us wait for another 2 more years for another one
This is so freaking cool can’t wait for the next episode
i wiated 1 year ty for  doing this
22:59 WHAT THE FU-
Why’d you kill🔥🦎 off
Part 11
Prediction :- Squirtle restarts everything to the time when they were getting picked back in proffesor Oak's lab. And this time squirtle will let charmander be picked,  so that he won't go out of path in the first place and he will happily watch his friend become a charizard and win pokemon league.
Cancer
22:59 snow said bad word
Mother fricker I thought charmander survived
This was terrible , literally awful  . Every other episode was funny and ironic. This was just sad.  Squirtle killed charmander, and what now he feels so bad he doesn’t want to evolve and he wants to relive his squad days? Idk me and kiddo think this should be deleted and a do over . Cuz after this long waiting ……this was disappointing
After 1 year theres finally another episode now time to wait another year for episode 11
Bravo to the entire cast of this series This episode is no joke fantastic. From Charmander's fate to Caterpie's moment of realisation, to Squirtle's development as a character. Squirtle was the hidden star of the show. And I love it.
It was sooo cool..🤩🤩
more
When is ep:11
Dude...I'll avoid giving spoilers in the comments but this really shocks me...
it was better with charmander...
ITS GEREEE
I HATE CATERPIE
When ep11 ??? And When is it going to happen
How about charmander??
When will episode 11 comes out
Plss  Part 11
im happy but we have to wait like 3 years more
The wait was worth it now to wait another year for the next one
what happend to missingo?
Those snovers looks like they came from Rick and Morty
ayoo wtff after 3 years u craete this bull crap wheres the next ep
Why do I feel like warturtal is going to tell them to bring back everybody
I wonder if they are gonna use the revive item and use the starters. That would be epic
Dialga is the Pokémon god of time so if wartortle finds him at the top of the mt where he is in the actual game then he can turn back time to save either charmander or at least chimchar
Make a fucking part 11 now!
Pokemon squirtle shippiddge 11
More episodes
I like this episode
is there another episode ? pls tell me there is another episode
After almost a year we get something
Yes it's here, the long wait... gone   Feels good
So I guess mewtwo had to fight that corrupted Haunter/Hitmonchan alone  since Bulbasaur Charmander and Squirtle never showed up at Cerulean Cave
Seeing charmanders head makes me uncomfortable
Taking guessing the next 2 episodes are origins of charmander and bulbasaur
Me when i found out that there is a new eppisode:😃 Me when i saw that the original squad was not there:😕
what is the name of the songs in the credits?
worst episode until now
Abomosnow *about to curse*  Wartortle *stops this master piece from getting demonitised*  Me: He is our hero because he stopped this from getting demonitised.
Snover is now my new favorite character.😂
It’s so amazing how are you LOL
I feel so bad for squirtle. I can't imagine losing friends that you've had since the start. The ending was so sad for me for some reason. Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and charmander had so much memories together..
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
I'm shocked and confused
Yk What You Should Slide The Perfect Bidoof Into The Next Episode
I think this series really took a turn for the better, but I apologize for the death of Charmander, and the pain Squirtle had to go through. I hope Bulbasaur is just fine doing whatever he’s doing now. I’m a fan of Bibarel, he’s like a large and wise hippie.
pls we want the next 2 ep pls make soon
I miss these so much
12:50 ???
Make episode 11
I think we gonna go into time travel
what a series! i cant wait for more! your content is always wonderful!
For some reason im in love and annoyed with Snover
i really wished charmander is still alive      he was the main character 1-9 right?
I cant wait for episode 11
Will charmander come back?
So squirtle was holding back evolving because that was charmanders goal for them.
I miss charmander
And balbousar
Where is charmander
Can't wait to watch this with my grandchildren
Anybody notice mewtwo at 12:52 ?
Squirtle reached level 99 and evolved into Wartortle. One more level and he will be a level 100 Blastoise. Can’t wait!
I’m just sad that charmander actully died and he’s supposed to be the main character
A truly great series can’t wait for ep 11
Oh and by the way bulbadaur did not die! just charmander so bulbasaur should be with squirtle insted of a turtwig
Its not starter squad without charmander and bullbasaur and just squirtle
This was awesome 🤩 but…  CHARMANDER
how long will it take for the next video
Yay this episode is finally out! See y'all in 2023-2024!
S charmender coming back
when is ep 12 comiing
Theory time: there are two episodes remaining and heres how they are gonna turn out:  episode 11: Wartortle is gonna meet dialgia and palkia at the top of the mountain and he is either gonna fight them and be sent back in time or just be sent back when he meets them. He is going to return to the point before charmander dies and saves him. The episode is gonna end with them killing caterpie, charmander and bulbasaur remembering what mewtwo said to them.  Episode 12: They go to cerulean cave and meet mewtwo, then they fight missingno or sumthin like that. But i feel like it would not be too satisfying as an ending so something else might happen.
I LOVE IT 😀👍 also do more
Naturalè
Ok.......🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
que paso con charmander y mewtwo
Hello
Snover: what are you gonna ask? Wartortle: ...something
Donde esta mi Charmander 😭😭😭. Devuélvemelo., mi jodido char 😞
he evolved!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I dont think Charmander is permanently dead.   Remember, he still has unfinished business left agaisnt Mewtwo.
This was definitely worth the wait.
Now to wait another 4 years
12:51 mewtwo
pleas mor
No fire lizard. No fun. Charmander is dead, I am out
Very Well done
Wooo. It’s been so long. Great job!
b i d o o f

Why you die the charmander
War vet squirtle
Moments that I expected to be in ep 10:  1. Missing No. 2. Meeting of Mewtwo and Charmander in Cerulean Cave.
After 8 years another episode
🐛❌
🐛❌
🐛❌
Ngl I'm mad about charmander not being in this
What if squirtle use water gun before Caterpie stabbed Charmander
What if pablo didnt ran into Charmander and Bulbasaur
Literally me after the ending : squirtle do be walking doe 😳
YAAAAASSSsssss
He became charmander he now knows that evolution makes you stronger
Song 24:22?
I waited 2 years for this... I expected more for the wait!
Now bring back the squad as fully evolved
YES FINALLY
See you guys in a year!
I wonder if there will be a pokemon moon and sun episode, it would be cool
Hi
I love this scene lol 22:56
I am ready to wait another 2-3 years for episode 11. This series is worth it. 😌
Can we all agree that when he uploads it makes our days so much better!
Well that went in some unexpected directions.
What the hell!
Its your fault
Also I love how at the end despite the tree guys asking simple or dumb questions wartortle still responds honestly and genuinely.
Tô ansioso pro EP 11 muito bom
So happy that this is back and definitely cannot wait for the next one. I have such fond memories of watching this with my best friend and can't wait to meet up to do so again for the rest of this series.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo murió el charmander ptmr
You are my hero
Rip da bird
where bulbasaur
Papue español
Why you not making next video please make make next episode fast I requested you
Thanks
The Snover having a flashback about a flashback is amazing
next episode release date = next year
I wonder the final vedio 3 going too happens?
I still find it insane how this started as a short miniseries about starter pokemon little adventures, now look where it is
this episode is kinda deppresing if you have this questions what about sandslash will charmander be ressurected? is bulbasaur ok? is red still burned? chimchar has died or he is just in coma?
What about charmander
Please release ep:11 as soon as possible
I knew Squirtle would make it so i voted on the poll
Fuck my chamande die
Please make more
12:12 is that charmandr,s head
did char die :(
Finally Forever
Snover:oh cool what are you gonna ask  Warturtle:something
11:52 "Together we will find Chumdar and make everything right again because of friendship reasons" This line breaks me every time
I miss charmander.
tradúzcanlo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
FINNALY
Wait... what if those "Pokemon gods" can revive Chimchar and Charmander?
22:50-23:00 Shell Smash
see you next year, hopefully
Time to wait 4 years for the next episode
Can I have a cut of this video of just the SNOVER? Thanks
Is Piplup gonna be the god up top?? O.o
THE SNOVER ARE SUCH A MOOD AND I WANT TO INVITE THEM ALL TO MY NEXT BIRTHDAY PARTY
This was crazy and worth the wait?? But now I just need more and more plus Stickle made me laugh so incredibly hard.
please keep making more i love your content
Watch ep9 first so you could relate to the lizard hat  Squirtle killed charmander  Maaaaarrrr deeeee rerrrr
See you in another 2 years
Took so long and its worth it... Made a year later, Hard to remember what happened in EP. 9 without rewatching it
where is piplup😢
Please make Charmander come back please man He’s my child hood
What is this song? 24:20-27:04
I have a question where is charmander
After so long I was watching these series in third grade now I’m fifth grade still loving this show
Omg finally episode 10
Squirtle killed charmander for no reason, charmander gave the caterpee a chance to hand over squirrtle but they didn’t, then squirrtle just obliterates him. Squirrtle is responsible for charmander’s death.
22:54 千！斤！墜！
THIS LITTERALY MADE ME CRY
WHY YOU KILLED THE CHARMENDER!!!!!!
BRING BACK CHARMANDER
I hate the caterpillar dude or dudette
I actually couldnt watch this one, chimchars voice actor was way too annoying. Its a shame as ep 1-9 were hilarious.   Waited ages for this….challenge failed.
I started watching this series when I was 7.now I’m 15
So is this the part where the team somehow get reunited somehow because of plot reasons
I want charmander back 😕 I did not wait years for my favorite character to die  I take that back mans turned into kratos the way he said move had told me he became the god of war mans had spartan rage equipped😂
Will there be a episode 11
I didn’t wait years for this
I’f only charmander and bulb was here
THATS IT?!?!
just think guyz, this series was started 8 years ago, after al long wait, ep 10 is finally here
22:16 Wartortle LVL 99 "Your level isn't high enough, bitch."
Now let's wait 5 more years for the next episode
bro i remember i used to love watching starter squad
what happened to Bulbasaur
Good episode but it was pretty disappointing to have waited all this time only to find out that Charmander died and now the series is continuing with just Squirtle. It started with the three of them and should end with the three of them. It doesn't really make sense to just have it be Squirtle from now on. Especially when the series is literally called "Starter Squad." Hopefully you find someway to get Char and Bulbasaur back in.
F por charmander
wow this episod was so epic
This is the Japanese "I" phrases  they use Charmander - ore Squirtle - ore (sometimes) -boku Bulbasaur -boku  Caterpie - watashi/watakushi (Which is a female phrase) Sandshrew- boku/ore
RIP charmander, the series wont be the same without him, but I do look forward to seeing where it goes from here
it will take 2 or 3 years for the next
i loved this series because of charmender now i feel sad i can't watch it it anymore i think i will take time to digest it😅.
If you see this comment, that's mean you just saw a cmt in 27k cmts and... that's mean you will have luck in the next 5 years... so like this comment
BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME!
%
its awesome but what the fuck you killed charmander =(    bruuuh....
How did charmander died
It’s not over there is still 2 more episodes and that will be in 5 years but I would like to see a bulbasaur and charmander resurrection
So charmander is dead?
Snow way monster:you can tell because there’s x’s in its eye areas, me:am i one year old or sum
Mor 3 boi
another quality animation. Plz hurry for the next one. quite school if u must
This suddenly went from Pokemon to God of War
Bruh, this series has more unexpected deaths than Game of Thrones
I hate you cause u killed Charmander
Others: NOOOO why a cliffhanger? Where's episode 11?  Me who read the manga: "I am 4 parallel universe ahead of you"
More seasons or episodes coming? This one was epic btw!
Legend is back 😀😀😀
THIS. IS. AWESOME.
Nooo charmander is died
Yay time to wait another year
I know what I’m nicknaming my abomasnow in BDSP
Yes I’m thinking charmander might have faked his own death prob because he is the mascot of starter squad
R.I.P Charmander he got killed the worst way by a stick.
FINALLY THE EP 10 CAME WAITING FOR YEARS FOR THIS
I would like that charmander stayed alive :(
When’s the next part
in so sad charmander died i reallly want some kind of revival and then he fights the glitch he made  in the very end and after the fight when he wins he finally evolves like he wanted to from day 1
Bulbasaur actually need some focus as well
Lvl 99 turtle vs lvl 50 tree
This makes no sense
HALT!
Dope ass video , love the series, can’t wait for the next
HOLY SHIT THE EPISODE IS OUT
(Brings back charmander and reverses time into before when caterpie is about to kill him)
I thought this series were for fun but now my fav squad is falling apart
Pls say charmander returns you cant just kill him of like that
This is soooo good
How to make a parody series. - Start off with comedic jokes as the main focus in the series -Give the main cast defining character traits. -Deliver an emotional turning point in the middle of the series. -Have a tone shift where the series becomes more story focused while still placing jokes in the right place.
Time to wait another almost 2 years hip hip hooray
He can still evolve at Lv.100 though
Haha funny  big snow man
Evolve to blastoise and kill the snow way
Finally
When Darth Vader trains luke
Is that the new charmander 3:32
Neon Genesis Bulbasaur
Freakin super saiyan wartortle
Pls (Ep.11)
😢 çharmander head
It's funny how the Abomasnow wasn't able to say a profanity before dying.
FINALLY IT’S BACK
When ep 11 will be release ?
"Ok time to wait 1937473 more years for 11" I DID MY WAITING 2 YEARS OF IT! IN YOUTUBE PURGATORY!
Having squirtle show up in Sinnoh\Gen 4 is probably no mere coincidence because of the Gen 4 remakes coming out next week as well as Arceus next January. I am disappointed Charmander died but it proves the old saying "live by the sword, die by the sword". Chimchar faced the same fate for the same reason.   The best thing for squirtle to do now is to help guide the next Kanto starters if trainers didn't pick them like he is trying with Gen 4 starters.
I love how in Ep 7 near the end in Caterpie's Gym, Whiskers tells Leonard that she believes in him and now in Ep 10; in one of Squirtles flashbacks, Whiskers tells Leonard that she believes in him again  Such a cute little callback Love the Voice Acting though glad to see this series is still going!
Finally  it's done been so long
The fact that squrtile was arguing with charmander in his last moments and that he made charmander so week to the point he couldn’t fight back and then carierpie killed him so squirtle played a part in his death and that and their last words to each other were them arguing
where were you
This kinda traumatized my childhood cause I love Pokemon
It took you two years to upload thos
the snover characters are my favorite in the series. i laughed at almost everything they said. well done 👌
“Being slightly bigger changes nothing”  Oh boy, if you’ve seen DBZ, you know how this ends
Wait what happend to empathy that was sqirtles thing.
Now. What the fuck happened to bulbasaur.
Wtf happened to o charmander
That was one of the most funnyest eps ive ever seen funny as fuck
When will episode 11 come out??
I am back after 5 years
please episode 11 pleASE--
I love Squirtel
When is the next episode
An episode is going to take another year or two or three
Jsi jeden z nejšikulinkaťoulinkatějších šikulků z celého Šikulkova na celém šikulkovském světě. :)
Lol noob
*Best anime of 2021*
This ep 10 make me cry.
What happens to wartortle next???
Best animations make ep 11 and 12
FINALLY IT'S HERE
Mewto is still fighting the glitch
I’m still sad charmanders dead

Now  we wait till years for another episodes let me guess another 3 4 years later
balls ligma
hey hey do another ep or else i will say a bad word

Squirtle*
Squirrel looks like a old man
Cool top 10 of cartoons what happens if chimchar was damn stupid
Finally dude
Can’t wait for episode 11 in 2024
Arceus is the god who made the earth dialga is time and palkia is space
Ep 11
Er where made a episode 11 if not kun yuo made a episode 11
By the time episode 11 comes out I'll have grandchildren to watch it with.
We need more
well this isnt what i expected, i miss Charmander and Bolbusour
Wow...just...WOW! This was SO good and the most well written story of pokemon I've ever seen, the animation it's on point and so it's the voice acting, I've waited for this for SO long, seeing charmander actually DIED, that Caterpie is wearing his head as a hat, and how numb Squirtle was obeying to caterpie, it genuinely breaks my heart, I absolutely adore the way you've written this series so far and I hope we can see even more of it in the future! Too bad it takes so long, but the waiting it's completely worth it! I'm a big fan of your work and I wish you all the best!💙
I really hope that Squirtle (Now worturtle) becomes Blastoise and mega evolves at some point. I also hope to see other starter pokemon.
Algorithm comment
Next part
WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE MY MAN CHARMANDER DIEEEEEE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazingly done👏👏👏
Well see everyone in a year. Amazing episode!
I just binge watched the whole series. I need much more. I demand MORE!!!! Blue Shell Man Guy is my spirit animal!!!
Please bring charmader back
I:hate that charmanders dead
Time to wait another four years for episode 11
but wat happend to charmander
When is episode 11 coming out
-Some of my closest friends in the world have been my greatest enemies. And i never even talk to them. -What?
How did Squirtle found these Starter are impossible to find In-game. And Squirtle supposed to be a Blastoise and we saw a sneak peak of Charmander alive but we don’t know which episode is it? Anything no one else had commented
Congrats on Starter Squad Episode 10! Squirrel now dawn to keep his childhood from 10 years ago because of the Caterpie Leader War lead to big misleading. Squirrel Turtwig And Chimchar are the best replacement possible he find in a different forest. Caterpie Leader is unknown while Charmander left dead And bulbusaur chose his fate. His Everstone is his key to regain his heart to find a way to fight back to chase down Chimchar Leading to a peak to the Pokémon Gods which can wish his fate because he is the Only one who can stop Caterpie War, Leader, And fix Charmander Attitude Join Squirtle On this Thrillers!
Fun fact: I’ve had 4 kids since the beginning  of these episodes.
Potential spoilers if you look at the subtitles or speak Japanese and paid close attention: "I'm a am an emissary of the mountaintops deities アルセウス".          アルセウス = Arceus
This whole time, Squirtle has really been the main character of this series.
Charmader is a god plz
There's definitely a reason we're in Sinnoh now... Dialga, Master of Time
I wonder if that Fearow was some kind of a bird
JEEZ I FORGOT ABOUT THIS SERIES! But now it's back!
Totally worth the wait
Squirtle is = Bucky from marvel
Plot twist the gods were just a magikarp
Man! That was awesome. I was missing to laught this way. Please dont stop making more episodes
Wartourtle isn't that strong >:(
This took that long and I haven’t been this pissed since I saw the Star Wars sequel trilogy
Please let the next episode be out, we love this one
LOL just realized the mockery on "the friendship reasons" and "I believe in us" nice ones! :D
Excited for ep 11.
What song is playing in the credits
5 yrs of a great story telling. Great job. You really are the best at what you do. The goat 🐐
Blastoise
22:56  WHAT THE FU-  hurray  edit: so next episode is in 2 years? like every other episode
Someone else translated the Chinese letters on the Charmander's head? 😔
Epic
plus how do pokemon know other pokemons levels
Yeah finally
how the fricken frack is a damn wartortle so damn powerful was the snow cocaine that he was shoved on to?!?!
Noice voice change doh
22:40 Squirtle just went sicko mode
Wait so this is not the end
So when is ep 11 going to be released
Hhhhhhhmmmmmmm> https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Tbh I don't know about this one it's pretty different from the others and I feel like it'd be really easy for it to turn into something worse from here, but shippidge has done great things over these years so I'm trusting in the process
Make it where charmader fake his death  caused the death really hit mr
Prat 11
Make episode 11
Será que tendremos que esperar otros 2 años?
I can imagine wortorle evolve into bastois and fight arceus and die the end
I've waited so long
Welcome back! Back again-  Me waiting a 4 years for the new one which is like 10:00 minutes
When this series started i was 13. Ive seen It for the first time when i was 17. I was in high school. When ep 9 camed out, i rewatched the whole series with my Girlfriend. Now I've broke out with my girlfriend. I'm at the university, 2nd year of medicine. 2 ep left for this series. The question is.......will this series end before I get my degree😂?
I kinda miss charmander is he gonna come back
Make these faster
Hey we didn't miss any pokemon trainer So  I have a theory the pokemon trainer will help Squirtle or  Maybe A will help sharmander To trust humans
R.I.P charmander
14:36 Lol...I just noticed Snover was being serious with this statement, because each Snover was literally being replaced by another.  I wonder if they have a hive mind...
I've noticed something it seems like that happened in this episode to the starters happened to the originals the grass type left the fire type died and piplup is the one who got pick   Piplup being picked part is by lol king basically the first one to relpy to this comment
The next episode should be call stater squad Resurrection ep 11 and Squirtle goal is bring Charmander and his new friend back  I hope this work
It would make sense if mega Charizard fight Mewtwo In the last episode 12  of starter squad should be called charmanders revenge
i thought the day would never come
This isn’t the same Without Charmander😭🦎🔥
I meant 11
When is part 12
Meanwhile in a another timeline  Turtwig: and this is how and why where here The (past) squad: … Bulbasaur: good thing you came or we’d be in some hot water *chomp* But I’m sure that we’ll look back at this and laugh  Charmander: … I can ensure you that for the rest of our lives when ever we “look back on this” I will personally come over to squirtle and personally smack him  squirtle: you said personally twice and holy god  Chimchar: god is dead and you killed him  squirtle: at this point I can’t tell if that is a expression or a the truth so please elaborate.
Another part 11 pls ill do anything
I miss you Charmander
This series has really shown its evolution from being a series with some funny jokes and the Kanto starters trying to get to their final evolved forms. To a Squirtle who has been through so much and had to witness his own die.
FINALLY HERE
I want to thank you for making part ten and not leaving us with a cliffhanger, I am satisfied and now I can move on in life and be the man I always dreamed to be knowing what happened, Thank you for being a part of my childhood.  I love you
I cant wait if u are going to make ep 11
The caterpie’s charmander hat letter translates to victory (勝利), and at the scene in the end where caterpie was asking squirtle to help because caterpie didn’t know what to do anymore, that scene she no longer had the hat on basically saying that they have lost.
No, Charmander why!?!? 😭😭😭 I him back 😭🤧⚰
Why is this the end of charmander now :(
Sidkdkkckcfifogik IM SOO HAPPY OMG
Mewtwo still fighting the glitch 😂😂😂😂
Finally I waiting for this my whole life

Yay it’s back
i dont think im ok with this, i needed to see more charmander character development D:
Oooooh boy this got me so excited for the rest
Why i think Squirtle is gonna be the next Kratos and then he will kill the Gods
Actually Squirtle didn't evolve to Wartortle but KRATOSSSSS
Best series on all internet, can't wait for the last episodes!! (Wel... I can wait a year for episode, don't rush it...) Nice job!!
I hate that charmander is dead he's my favorite starter
finally i have been waiting for a whole year
Holy frickin' hell, that was awesome, I thought it was just going to be such a lighthearted series, but this turned dark hella fast, also R.I.P. to everyone.
This was actually pretty inspiring in an abstract way.
Dude this was literally my childhood
Après des années, enfin.
Soo will we be waiting a year for the next episode
This is amazing, but if you make an episode 11 please it to were charmander comes back to life but as a better pokemon
Another year lets gooo
Like where latterly. The best youTuber
Me and my brother love the series
In the forest is that mewtwo fighting missingno?
2 years for this one another 2 for the next one
I’d say that this is the beginning of Blue Shell Man Guy’s redemption arc.
IVE WAITED SO LONG
i hope charmander comes back
OMG FINALLY MY GUY
NOAH

The legend is finally back
Please do Arceus as the god that would be awesome!
oh i can’t wait this end is so awesome
Yow It's back
This ep is the darkest and has most deaths of main charachters i have seen in this series.
17:52 funniest thing i have ever seen in this ep
Charmander will be back mewtwo is still fighting missingno surley he will fix everything once his fight is over
Finally a new episode!!!
My guess is the god he mentioned is Dialga and that the end Squirtle will time travel and save Charmander
Can't wait for the next episode ❤️
I miss the original squad, charmander might get revived as well
Finally!!!
Please release the 11th ep soon
Es war zwar Englisch aber die Gefühle von den Pokemon habe ich trotzdem gespürt
finally for so long the new ep come
finally the new ep come
GOD IM SO PISSED OFF ABOUT THAT CATERPIE if Charmander Had Became Charmeleon At Any point Before Squirtle Was Captured He wouldve Gave Them Hell
Why Why charmander Where's Balbasaur
it would be good if charmander survived or squirrel meets bulbasaur up there
wait is meow2 up there?
Wow, I gotta say that the animation looks a lot smoother in this episode and less choppy in previous episodes
Alright! See you all in 2023!
i miss charmander
Isn't Wartortle still shifting the blame by searching out the Gods? He wants to know who makes the rules, but as he himself said, he doesn't have to follow the rules.  And though everyone is sure he'll time travel, Wartortle doesn't know about that ability of Dialga's.
charmanders my fav
Was that improv? 6:09
21:04 "...it's not me you were afraid of."   Obeying Caterpie ≠ fear Caterpie Acting for himself = Evolving  6:58 & 21:27  So... Disobeying Caterpie = Acknowledging he had a choice?
Im just gonna say it, squirtle evolving was fucking epic
so I was curious and started on this episode and I have got to commend you for making a solid stand-alone watch that only becomes stronger upon going through the rest of the series, excellent work
Where did Turtwig go? Is he coming back? Is Piplup going to appear and where's Bulbasaur at?  Thank you for this upload! 👏🏽  Edit: 5:25 You shouldn't lie to your uncle, man. Haha!
2 more left. So it's 4 years huh? I hope I'm still alive then.
I'M SO MUCH OF A BIRD THAT IT HURTS!
I was waiting for 2 years not for this. What's with Mewtwo/MissingNo storyline? What's with others? "Endless war" is not an answer, there were much more important things then wars between worms and lizard, it was told for 9 episodes and... This. Disappointing. I hope it will be open at least in retrospective with massive flashbacks, otherwise it's the worst mistake storyteller ever did, even worse than LOST
I have a Theory about Charmander. Maybe Squirtle will tell the Gods to help revive his dead friend.   If that is not the case, then maybe Bulbasaur will go to the Cave that Mewtwo told them. And try to convince Mewtwo to revive Charmander. There is a possibility he could be alive..
no fucking way
Bluey kill him 13:28
22:56 is my favorite 😂
This should be season 2 because bulp is food and car is dead so season 2
I feel bad for Mewtwo. Poor guy probably hasn’t slept in ten years.
the fact that charmander was going to say  "i just wanted to get squirtle back" before he died
I don't like Squirtle just kill him😭😭
IM 2 WEEKS LATE BUT ITS TIME THE WAIT IS OVER
can I make a reaction video of the series,
28:13 See you in another year or so (seriously, stop taking long gaps in between episodes.) Edit: By CONSTANTLY taking long gaps in between episodes of this series, You have committed sloth (a deadly sin.) Do you even KNOW what happens to people who commit deadly sins.
ONE MILLION PERCENT SHELL SMAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSHHHHHHH
Potential spoiler warning! . . . . Oh my GOD!!!A not-so-hidden foreshadowing in the identity of the God being referred here!Aruseusu is Arceus's Japanese name
the greatest comeback in history.
7:58 WHY DID YOU LET THE CHARMANDER DIE?! You better revive him at some point or I will... rain down every agony, every violation imaginable, upon you. I will parade your cold body from every corner of the planet, AND FEED YOUR SOUL TO THE VILEST FILTH IN HELL! THAT IS MY PROMISE!  Edit: I'm going to KILL YOU for that Pierce Shipp!
Why do the female bidoof have male voices??
There are way too many theories in the comments about ways of reviving charmander. The more ways there are, the harder it would be for shipp to bring charmander back.   12:51 In the background Mewtwo is busy fighting missingno. Then who is in cerulean cave?
Charmander is stronger than all the Pokémon’s
This got dark as fuck... I can't wait for more 😭
I've waited for this for too long mannn  Damm
Legend says Bulbasaur is still eating
WHEN THE HELL DID WARTURTLE GET SO CRACKED
lets goo
Best thing in my life
When Pokémon meets Game of Thrones 😆
Charameleon
Please get the bulbusar and charamender  😥😥
First episode was literally 8 years ago and we are only on episode 10
Smashtasm please
Throughout this entire episode we notice how broken squirtle really is. Shattered emotionally. Mentally not there. He's broken. Everything he's been through has shaped him so much.
I watch it everyday 💝
I am sad that Bulbasaur , Charmander and chimcar died
IM WAS WAITING SOO LONG
Well that was…unexpected. The glitch plot line, charmander’s character development, all gone. Certainly fitting with this series’s reputation
Prediction, he goes to the top of the mountain and finds Charizard there. Charmander lived and abandoned the other two, the hat caterpie had was fake.
Rip Charmander :(
tbh charmander might of been mean but he was a nice pokemon, the adventures on squirtel is nice. And i would like to see more!
Intense!!!!!!!!!!!
im not crying what are you talking about my eyes are just wet
When the 1st episode of this came out I just turned 9 now im 17 I don't remember when I started watching but I watched when before I was in middle school
Oh my god! What will Wartortle ask!?
Charmander was my fav character;c
Why did charmander die I’m so sad
Yo! Dude, this amazing. The Plot was really funny and i enjoyed this. Keep the great work!
Есть кто-то из Русских фанатов данного шедевра?
My theory is either sandshrew who’s now sandslash is alive as he just left the base but I’m not certain
TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
I'm really mad that you changed the entire story over the course of an episode but I can't deny you are talented all the folks who worked on this
When you make next episode  Please make next episode fast🙏
great work!!! I keep waiting for this, thank you for every effort! but it is really devastated to say goodbye to charmander and bulbasaur :(((((( it hurts :(((
FINNALY BUTTTTTTTT WE WANT A PART TWOOOOO
Its funny how the water was spraying out of its buck teeth🤣
screaming crying and throwing up
bring EP 11 to the end please
ITS HERE!!
No one:        Shippedge: "bLuE sHeLl MaN gUy"
Bulbasaur is the perfect example of *Ignorance is bliss*  Even squirtle said he had a best ending while others died or suffered due to not ignoring things
I haven't finished Platinum yet, is Spear Pillar atop Mt. Coronet?
Your videos get millions of views each. Awesome.
IS EP 11 COMING?
12:50  did anybody talked about this Mewtwo's cameo scene?
I don't like char
Mah man is back
Sad that our man,the lizard,appears to be dead and cannot be saved.
I cannot resist being sad for squirtle,I know he cannot ensure seeing his friends and buddies died for generations.
these snovers really looking funny
Why is Shawn Mendes head on canopies head
...not what I was expecting, but still. All the months of waiting have been worth it!
This episode was fantastic. But the snovers for the best part lol
... remember when this series used to be just dark comedy? Now it's an epic, heart wrenching story, and I honestly cannot wait to get more.
I thought that Bidof sounded a bit too much like Rainbow Dash. So glad to see Dawnsomewhere here
I need pt.11 there’s to much lore
i wait for part 11
Looks like one Bidoof went blasting off again.
Who else thinks Chimchar is more of an asshole than Chamander was?
To bad that Charmander died
The next episode should be about bulbasaur just because he was never an important character
cry
No way turdwig is in this episode
Just noticed that Snow's master, アルセウス is the kanji for Arceus. Think Wartortle is headed straight to Pokemon God?
where’s bulbasaur?
It looks like Squirtle has shadows under his eyes
Trash
"You can't escape the wrong decision by putting it on others" Prolly the hardest thing Squirtle said in this entire series.
Wow so glad I stumbled onto your channel, awesome videos and I hope to see more :)
This was truly epic
Okay, I'm gonna say something unpopular alongside my praise of the episode (BIG SPOILER): . . . . . I'm not terribly moved that Charmander finally got himself killed. He was a monster. I love that the writer had the nerve to show him reaping what he sowed. I love the shift of focus to Squirtle, and him dealing with the concept of responsibility. Excellent work. I can't wait to see how everything pans out. Everyone's performances continue to be top notch as well. Snover is hilarious.
Cliff hanger ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pacuando el de español
I want moooooore
Man i leave this serious and every time i think of it! I come back BOOM new episode!
I’ve waited sooooo soooo long for this! Great job keep up the good work! Where can I donate?
Whats the name of the song that plays at the end?
Oh god i waited for this sooo much time and i love it
R.I.P Charmander bro. I thought bulbasaur would cact the stick with his vine whip. I can't wait for 11 though. His voice is awsome!
I Love the talking tree guy. So awesome voice acting
So wait is Mewtwo still waiting in Cerulean Cave?
damn that was dope
I miss Charmander... But no one has everything forever
This show is a cult for me, very creative . AMAZING
Never knew caterpie the cute bug can be this evil 😂
OH MY GOD! I'VE BEEN WATING 2 YEARS FOR THIS! THANK YOU! This is a high-quality video!
Honestly, I kinda wanna see Charmander be brought back through time travel, and the story is being set up with the Sinnoh legendaries in a way that that would make sense, and the thing with Mewtwo was set up as the next plot point but didn’t happen, but idk, it might go against the themes of this episode, of moving on from the past. I just think it’s tragic that Squirtle didn’t see the change in Charmander at the end of episode 9, and just assumed his motivation was to evolve. I hope that gets brought up later in the story; it seems to be implied that Squirtle did find out (with him saying Chimchar will come around, and him projecting Charmander onto him), but idk.
LESS GO EPISODE 10
Last episode 8-9 took 1 year Episode 9-10 took 2 years Episode 10-11 will probably take 3 years
Now the long wait starts again for episode 11
Jesus Christ, the Caterpie hat reveal was not ok
So was Abamosnow using Sheer Cold on everyone?
This is better than the pokemon anime
4:03 I’ll Pick him as a Starter,helper and friend!🌌📺🎮
Make ep 11 pls this series is the best
amazing work
Poor Squirtle. He was truly broken before he evolved
Episode 12 is gonna be movie length by itself Released in 2030
seria legal se o charmander tivesse vivo e o bulbasauro e ele fossem os deuses kk
Bang kasih subtitle indonesia pls bang
LET’S GOOOOOO! I search this up every month or so and we finally got it!!
Episode 4: Caterpie Leader: You may have won this time, Lizard. I swear on my life that one day, I will have my revenge.  Episode 10: Spearow Leader: You may have won this time, Worm. You will pay for what you have done. I will have my revenge.
I want to know what actually happened to Charmander did he actually die
“You can tell because there are X's where its eyes should be” xD
finally
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO BULBASAUR AND CHARAMANDER
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CHARMANDER DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
This went from: haha funni pokemon do murder To: A story that teaches about choice and leadership, and Probobly something political or religious idk i just came here for nostalgia...
1:18 kinda reminds me of Big Chungus hahaha
This is PERFECT
Caterpie have a Charmander hat wow caterpillar kill Charmander and put it on the Hat
Why Squirtle looks so old maybe 30 years
Charmander. Fucking. Died… This hit hard. I swear if he returns into a ghastly im going to laugh
I look forward to seeing The Almighty 'Aruseusu'  If you know, you know...
Ainda falta 2 EP acho que o Charmander vai ser revivido!
So is chimpchar charmander 2.0
It was prity cool
honestly I think the series is not that cool without Char & Bulb they were like the highlights and making squirtle the main character wasn’t so promising😢
Plot Twist: bidoof is on the top of the mountain😂
Lmao 🤣 Wart: “they’re gonna have to answer to me” Snow tree: “ah cool, what are u gonna ask?” Wart: “…….something” Man that threw me off guard lol
No more charmander
I’ve been waiting for this for two years
I saw mewtwo fighting someone
Son of a gun got us with the cliffhanger..
Where is Blastoise pls add him next episode he's my favorite
Rip Charmander and Chimchar
wow when the blue shell man crushed the tree guy he tried to say what the fu
Charmander nooo😭😭😭😭😭
Wow I never imagine that you will make the EP 10 just because it took so long
It's fucking wild seeing people acting surprised by Charmander's death, as if he deserved redemption or a hero's arc. The dude was an edgy teenager's idea of a tragic hero, for fuck sake he responded to anything and everything with violence, he expressed his broken emotions through mass murder bordering on genocide. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, Caterpie was bound to respond in kind. He had it coming.
I like this direction
What are the Japanese letters on the back of Charmander's head?
I love how this series went from 3 Pokémon having problems with being a team to fucking Doom eternal
So charmender is just dead and now the one who close to killed him is a god? Don't gods like not kill unless it's a demon?
WTF finally... The fuckin slow bro did it
Imagine if MewTwo he’s up there and he’s mad He’s been waiting for 20 years
Charmander is really dead?... 😭😭
Starter Squad Lore: https://youtu.be/Ux5cQbO_ybw
What happened to bulbasaur?
Ep 10 was good
How/when did bulbasaur die? Or is that yet to be explained?
awsome stuff
I hope palkia and dialga will turn back time so wartortle can safe charmander
Its been years
Caramender toldmi ju god polinom ju lajv toldmi tet
WOOOOOOOooooooooooooo..............!!!!
God of War III at end😂
Some food for thought here. Although Squirtle projects Bulbasaur and Charmander onto Turtwig and Chimchar, they're actually polar opposites of them Like, Charmander was dragging Bulba and Squirtle around without asking for their opinion and eventually began to see them as his friends, Chimchar hates Turtwig is Squirtle and tries to ditch them every chance he gets Bulbasaur was goofy, carefree and always going with the flow and went along with whatever Charmander wanted, Turtwig is down to earth and realistic and as soon as he realizes what Squirtle really is about, he leaves him Tood bad we didn't get to see Piplup, curious what he would have been like
I t s. B a c k
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Dude it’s been a damn year since you released a new episode or a new video does it really take that long for you to make a episode
CHARMANDER!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ep.11 ?
I thought this was all going to be a vision Squirtle was having before stoping Charmander from being stabbed.
It took 8 year to make all 10 episod...Congrat btw to this channel
please do the next episode quiqlie
Charmanders death was..
Took a while but its here also i love the trees
Charmander.....................................................I KNOW HE WILL MAKE A COMEBACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bet: one of the other 2 starters will reappear, there is only one character that dies for character development
Kinda lost interest with no charmander
Hope cap 11 comes soon
I have a theory since I noticed we were in Gen IV (pearl, diamond and platinum), and the end of the episode actually also follow that theory.   I think that Squirtle (wartortle. Whatever you wanna call him) will meet the gods in the next episode, and ask something about his past or life in general. However He will inevitably convince the gods (probably giratina, palkia and dialga or something) that they should give him another shot at life and send him back into the situation we see in the end of episode 9. This time he won't care about what his trainer (caterpie) says, and sacrifice his life for charmander and end the story at that. Maybe at the very end, we will see fully evolved bulbasaur and charmander, still sorrowing their fallen friend after all the time that would have passed.  If this is will be the case, then it would be so cool, especially the end since we would lose our protagonist for someone he seems to value higher then his own life, and thus, will Squirtle learn the meaning of friendship, and life itself.
Squirtle is going kratos
I have only just realised the song that played when wortortle is fighting abomasnow is the Charmander vs geodude song rock smasher
Chimchar and turtwig and piplup are the children who don't do anything
I hope in the last or next episode  we'll see the other starter trios
I've been waiting 2 years for this episode and it paid off...
I'm so happy this came but how amazing would it have been if this came out on November 19th 😱 truly would have been legendary
Do a part 11
Amazing 👏
THE MEWTO
What happened to bulbasaur
Squirtle is my favourite pokemon when i was kid , i really love this cool.
This took so long
Onux. Them munkuy
2:31 super smash brothers reference?
more it's better than the real anime
Charmander is dead
Love it!
Oh no! Just realized I gotta wait another year for the next episode.
Her is boobasaur
we want dialga and palkia
in a video after episode 9 charmander was still alive so how can he be dead
How have you not won awards
22:19 squirrel goes super squirtel
Wohh 👍 i love it
Wartortle sounds like asgore from Undertale
Someone set another 2 year timer please
Hits me hard when I saw Caterpie wearing charmander’s head as a hat
I want more
too epic
Loved the episode!  It was worth the wait for sure.  The snover’s were my favorite
I like the new story.... But I don't love the new story.
It really bugs me the caterpie doesn’t die
holy SHIT was squitle the real protag the entire time
the thing that is painful is THAT ITS GONNA TAKE A YEAR MORE FOR AN EPISODE
So wait what happened to charmander and bulbasaur?
The fact it started with bidoof is amazing
The return of the king
Turtwig is us-
I just realised all the Bidoof models are females and I think that kinda makes their voices funnier
1 year
O-oh OMG
i don want charmender die why you made it like this don made it like this turned the time and mate charmender live and his evolve make squirtale back to charmender side  if you not made it huh i dis like
is charmander coming back :[
Incredible work, keep it up!
turtwig: so hold on charmander ACTUALLY DIED everybody else: HE ACTUALLY DID DIE?!
24:19 "something" bro this is soo funny
I was hoping charmander would grab the stick evolve and the kill all the caterpie
nooo chamander
Dam he died and we got time skip episode
Fantastic Please Make Another Episode
Charmander was my favorite character and to see him die hit hard
22:58 WTF BOOM
I’m happy this came out but now I’m sad I’ll have to wait at least a whole other year for the next one
More Pokémon videos
More video  more more videos!!!!!!!!!!!please
What happend to Charmander?
SnoversSo funny
This is amazing
what about missingo and mewtwo?
I want the lizard back
HOW AM I A WEEK LATE TO THIS!!!!
This series has certainly evolved several times since Ep 1
Lol who had to rewatch 1-10 episodes
imagine charmander verses these guys  the types wouldn't make sense cus charmander would bust there ass with  ember cus their skin burn but sadly hes dead 2:05
if red picked charmander [charmander makes geodude and onix dig in the ground and die like in the lizard slayer]
Can we all appreciate the fact the animation quality became better look at the start then the end
nobody’s asking the real questions where’s Piplup? what happened to Bulbasaur afterwards? and most importantly...    how is red’s mother coping with red’s “disappearance”
Finally
don't kill off charmander guys that's just dumb
at least get bulbasar back
Jimmy build dif
When will the next park be release
I want to see the next park I love ❤️ this Pokemon thing you know what I mean
Actually this episode just brings Squirtle more into the mindset of charmander and he claims he wants to defy or get help from the gods. I really think that he will go back in time. I at least hope that he does.
can you get charmander back to life i hate the caterpie please kill caterpie
he just meets a dev up there
Spoiler alert: the god is Missingno.
I hope the next  one comes out soon
6:37  Bluey used Frustration! *Critical hit!* Wild BIRD fainted!
the wait was totally worth
R.I.P charmander
2 years until next episode
This episode was great but it doesn’t feel the same without Charmandar and Bulbasaur😞💔
No not charmander that is really hard dude R.I.P charmander 😔😭😭🕊🙏🏼
8 years of character development just to killed my boy Charmander when he finally came around my heart is broken and for god sakes can we please get this man to 1 million subscribers
I feel like he's gonna ask to go back in time to save Charmander
Are we really going to wait like 2 years or more for the next episode? 💔
Nice
Oh damn the next episode will be so cool
Yeah next episode will come in 1 year
Man I have to admit, the Story is actually pretty good
bring charmander back it made me really sad when he died :(
It's been a year. I've missed you so much buddy
RIP Charmander
I missed charmander.He was my fav
This episode smacked me hard with the emotion that was put in this. GREAT episode and congrats  Also I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did
Spoiler alert  :                        I think Warturtle will revive charmender and chimchar
And then you realize there is red ( just thinking because there was Mewtwo too or you can say there will be mewtoo or Pokémon god
I've been waiting for this
those snover are annoying
Yess
Can't wait till he's a blastoise, he'll beat the gods.
YOOO IT'S HERE
https://youtu.be/Tv5z7N5hYgw
The moment I translated 16:06, I realised I was an idiot. アルセウス (Aruseusu) - Arceus
I feel like squirtle is lying about charmanders death.  Maybe mewtwo can bring him back? Or at least devolve squirtle him?
Such great story writing, he better time travel and make everything right 😂😂
Chimchar reminds me of someone...Hmmm.
Now I wait another year
Whatttt why charmender died 😕 he is my fav character in this series 😑.
But what about Cerulean cave and Mewtwo and Missingo? Squirtle was talking about evolving meant you cant go back and finish unfinished business, is he going to somehow time travel back? In one of squirtles flashbacks at one point in the background we can actually see Mewtwo fighting the deformed glitch or whatever it is, I find it highly likely that time travel will be happening.
Ep 11 will come out in short time  Le: the short time 5 years later
I thought Charmander was the main character and he’s dead.
When is the next episode coming out
It broke my heart when Charmander died I thought he was gonna survive😢
I think we could see arceus in episode 11
I just realized that when Caterpie said "Whoever takes control of you next, I pity them.", she meant that they will end up alone and broken as she did as well because Squirtle would be too powerful to stop once he's given the chance to kill.
You started thinking charmander was the main character but in reality it was always squirtle
When will part 11 come on
Yo remember that hitmonchan
See you guys in 3 years
Absolutely cannot wait for the next episode.
2 years Later... Episode 11 is finally out
Wait, I just realized something what happened to bulbasaur? I mean know what happened to charmander who is died, and squirtle is evolving to Wartortle. Did he died in war or just run away?
Is charmander really death for real real??????
What happened to Bulbasaur?
It's back!
How's he level 98 without hydro pump
what's the next video gonna be about shippdddge "I don't know... something."
You finally uploaded
Do more partssss!!!!!
17:54  "you can tell cause there are x's where his eyes are"
Bird sounds
DO NOT END AT 12 THIS IS THE BEST FRICKING YOUTUBE VIDEO I WATCHED YOU HAVE TO MAKE WAY MORE PLS PLS
holy fuck it returns
I like it
ima just hope dialga sends him back in time to save charmander
Hey Shippadige how many episodes will there be?
It took two years but it was worth it
I liked the episode a lot, but that was a tough one to swallow.
I expect wartortle to unlock instinct form or star platinum bu the end of the series
Breed bring back Charmander
As chamander said ( MAKE THEM FASTER) srry if im being mean
I love it want part 11
this was fricking AWESOMEEEEE!
Also the Bidoof having the voice of Rainbow Dash Presents is really cute ^^
well guys, see you in the next episode which will probably come out when eevee gains a new evolution or when Ash turns 11 :D
Dime que cjarmander resucita de alguna manera era mi personaje favorito
Finalmemte
12:51 so who won? HitmonHaunterMissingNo vs MewTwo
I just realized something: the timeskip is 10 years. Pokémon Red & Green released in Japan in February 1996 while Pokémon Diamond and Pearl released in Japan in September 2006. And this is the first time we’ve seen Pokémon outside of the original 151. And all of those Pokémon come from Gen IV
After years of waiting it’s here and…. Uh kinda wierd BUT MAKE PART 11
Please upload at least a month or maybe a week.... This kind of cartoon is such a masterpiece and fun
Man, what the fuck. Amazing, but what the fuck.
BRING BACK CHAR PLEASE
Finally! I wated so long!!!!!
If chimchar woke up: Chimchar:u saved me why? Wartwartle:mmm,monkey
charmender death really hit me  and now i hate squirtle
Write the names of pokemon correctly fool
n e a t
I wish there were more episodes
FINALLY
R.I.P charmander
Wait so what happen to mewtwo ?
Watch happend to charmander and blabasaur
It’s probably red from the Pokémon games  Who’s up on the top of the mountain
Fan theory: wartortle meets the gods which are Palkia and Dialga. After a talk and some fighting Dialga reverses time back to the moment caterpie kills Charmander, only this time he saves Charmander. Then they go to cerulean cave and talk to mewtwo
Nooo the bidoof 😭😭😭
a fun little Easter Egg: if you watch this with subtitles, whenever the Snovers talk about “Snow in the way” the S is capitalized, meaning that they were always talking about someone and not the snow itself. When Squirtle talks about snow, the S is lowercase. That was pretty clever.
Been along the ride since no.2 got released. A lot has happen since then, and I can't see what crazy shit happens in the next 3 years (my calculation for the finale)
Chadtortle
After ao many months  of waiting its finally here🥺💜
Bring back carmandor
Why did squirtle only evolved to warturtle? Its been 10 Years.
As long as you stand, The battle isn't over. -Sun Tzu The art of war
SO whens the next one 2023?
If chimchar woke up: Chimchar:you saved me,why? Wartwortle:mmm moneky
where's part11
I feel bad for Squirtle (or now Wartortle), after i watched this...  Just the fact that he predicted that what has happened, that what we saw in his flashbacks, leaves just a feeling of guilt to me...  Edit: I also subscribed after sending this comment ;D
Wow the nostalgia, ever since I watched this years ago. This brings me memories. Thank you for this shippiddge. We love you
Plz upload fast 🥲 i can't wait 1,2 years
Is there gonna be a happy ending..?
YEEEESSSS Ñ Ü
as epic as that was ... why did u kill charmander? he had true heart and now he's dead.
That was epic i will wait for as long as it takes for episode 11 if there will be one
FINALLY
One of my favorite things about pokemon is when a Pokemon evolves, and you did an awesome job with it, after all this time we finally got Wartortle, too bad we don't have Charmeleon.
Guess we gotta wait another three years
Finally ep 10 is here i have been waiting for this
This shit is deep I was crying at  the end god damn
12:51 it’s mewtwo 22:59 lmao 23:17 he said it, he said the title
How Charmander died
And Bulbasaur whatever yes the plan
Where is Charmander
What the f!!!!
15:24 secret Easter egg
Did you just make a origin of a new dragon ball?😂
This is really tragic because Squirtle’s greatest fear was Change but by not changing he lost everything that he has ever loved and desired . Not only by not wanting to Change he gave up the most important thing which was his morality and then devolved into being a slave which was what he was once used to be proud to be for his trainer. This is the most tragic and well made character I’ve ever seen Good Job!
to think that all of this started because of the trainer didnt pick charmander and charmander murdering pablo
dude your videos there so cool bro when is ep1 1 coming out
Can't wait for next ep 😭😂
I’m sad now not charmander his arch was finally starting
So cool men but so sad
hurry up and give EP11
12:51 a dire consequence after the events of episodes 8 and 9…
Mewtwo and Missing No. are still out there fighting and corrupting… how will this tie in again since charmander is dead now for 10 years… and never visited the cave or cleaned up the mess.
21:16
That Abomasnow scared the hell our of mw when he popped up... But I wish there were more Pokemon who looked mutated or further beyond evolved like that.
Episode 11, coming out when everyone in the comment section is married and has kids
Damn. He’s going full doom slayer on them
can't wait for ep 11 in 2024
So uh... What happened to Piplup? Is he some kid's starter, or what?
Can’t  wait for episode 11
y e s
Right when I thought about the series, it came 😊
I can tell that Blastoise is your favorite Pokémon. Let’s go!! 💪🏼
ah man im really happy that the series that i watched during childhood is continuing. The story did take a dark turn huh. back then i only laughed at the jokes, but now that im older im starting to understand more and appreciate the good writing for these lovable characters. im sad that charmander died but the way squirtle evolved really made his death not in vain. im really curious of the next episode so im surely gonna stick around till the end!!
Omg it's out yay
Next part ASAP plz
I want eighter 1 of these things to happen:  1:A psychic pokemon is in the mountain and wartprtle will ask him to go back in to change the past.  2: charmander will join wartortle as a ghastly.
Thanks for making my day bro. I’m not feeling well today so your starter squad episode had me laughing my head off 😂😂
Wait what happen to charmander and bulbasaur ¿hes really die?
Char is basically a spoiled child when they don’t get what they want
See you in another 2 years
This series was good at first but now it is bad you went to carmander dying to new people no that’s not how you put a series at least tell us what happen to him
Loved this episode: While it depresses me to see the fates of charmander and bulbasaur, at least squirtle was able to understand his weaknesses and how to overcome them, and now became a lvl 99 god!
I’ll see you guys my Junior year of college
the wait is over but there will be another wait ep 11 and then ep 12 and then next season i hope the starting team ending is much more amazing very epic hope charmander comes back in ep 12 he is my favorite
Still can't get over Charmander being dead...
Bro squirtle just turned into kratos
Ese cartepie es un villano
Mataron a chamander
I remember watching startersquad as a kid but now it comes to an end
Sad Charmander is dead
In the new episodes can wartole wish for charmander to come back to life
FINELLY I WAITED SO LONG I FORGOT HOW TO SPELL
Part 11 please
squirtle became kratos
Noooooooooooooo charmander died noooo😲🤤☠
Lol I always though Squirtle was the same one. Apparently, all three of them were insane in their own way.
Starter squad was my childhood and when episode 10 Didn't release I thought it had ended....  Thank u for the journey bruv will support u till the end
And so, Squirtle became Kratos
Ending gives me God of War vibes
man only 2 more years till the next
OMG NOSTALGIA, starter squad is back!
*sips tea* Boys, we got what we have been waiting for. Now we must wait another 2 years
I am really sad at both Charmander and Chimchar's death!!!It was very heartbreaking for me!!I think u could have avoided that!!!But anyway's nice episode!!! I hope u bring some sought of twist in the next 2 episodes !!!Also missing Bulbasaur too!!
22:16. enough said
I see why this took multiple years
River Vitae's voice as abomasnow sounds like Terence Stamp (the motivational speaker/con-artist from the movie "Yes Man")
*"IM A BIRD TWEET TWEET"*
2 years later, we finally got ep 10.
The legend is back guys
I like the whole series! When for the next episode?
It was amazing legend squirtel finally evolved
see u next year👋
Poor charizard I thought he won😔😞😢
one of the best series i ever watched
Best episode ever! Having Charmander die then Chimchar that takes balls. I hope Arceus is watching... :)
i like chucky cheese
Denying the existence of beaver society is a class 4 violation of beaver society
so no one is gonna talk about charmanders death?... R.I.P charmander
NEW STARTER SQUAD EPISODE LESS GO
When are you gonna do another one
I love Snover’s voice
Wartortle's voice is like charizard's voice it's like a beast
I love worturtle
BRO THIS WAS SO LONG TO WAIT BUT FINALLY 😩😩😩
Hey we still have revive's we can use
I think the gods he will see up the mountain will be Arceus, Dialga, and Palkia. It’s the only explanation I can think of for why they jumped straight to the Sinnoh Region after the timeskip. Since Arceus is god of Pokémon it’s only right they’ll see him. I also feel like they might use Dialga’s time powers to send Squirtle(Now Wartortle) back in time to make things right.
The free guy reference  is spot on.
I have no words. I've been waiting and all those waiting paid off. Episode 11 pleaseeeeeeeeeee
24:36 is the best part (jk this episode is actually really good I just like the music credits)
Welp Time To Wait 2 Years This Time
Rip btw i sic charmander died i guss he was cught as a gastley he is agangar i hope
EP 11= Wartortle Slain Giratina  EP 12= Wartortle Slain Dialga EP 13= Wartortle Slain Paikal (Maybe Ivysaur come Help Wartortle(Battle of the God 1) EP 14= Wartortle and Ivysaur lose to Arceu and Ivysaur Die (Battle of the God 2)  EP 15=Wartortle furious and  evolve to Blastoise or Mega evolve by it self maybe (Battle of the God 3) EP 16=Blastoise break the rules become 101lvl and beat arceus  EP 17= A new story begin    I wait for EP 10 too long i was excited when u upload EP 10 Btw Where Piplup got choosen by trainer ?  The story too fast
after waiting 2 damn year
Can you make another one please🥺
To be honest I think that the deity that’s now was talking about was the game itself.cause what kind of Pokémon goes rogue in the game,and machamp was basically in control of the game as we see when he died he looked at some sort of code and went crazy.snowy was controlled by the game,probably in the next episode squirted will fight the game itself.(jus a theory that I thought.)
The flashback dialogue of snowger was good
I saw previous episodes again and I miss charmander very badly
when is ep 11
FINALLY
I want charmander back what if mewtwo just switched him either another charmander and took the one we know to the top of the mountain and when squirtle gets up there he just sees a charizard now that is some come back I wanna see
your promised and you did not deliver, bruh wtf is this crap its so bad
this isnt funny, this isnt cool. Its a dumb sequel that should not exist. What is this stupid mountain story!?!?!?!?
Too late to comment but here we are years waiting, we all been doing now finally
Holy Shiinotic, Starter Squad uh... got intense!! O_O Crazy awesome job! I could totally see Abomasnow as some kind of temple guardian!
Charmander: we'll find out if I'm ded or not Also Charmander: *ded or probably not*
I MISSED U WHERE WERE YOU🥺🥺🥺😩😫💅🏾
12:51 was that mewtwo??
the return of the king
Ep 11 YEEEHAW
13:42 gosh that face is nightmare fuel.  Void of emotion. The colors of the frame. His skin tone looks so... _____.
На русском мало перевода
And What is this something???
I wonder what happened to the missingNo and Mewtwo. Did mewtwo find out charmanders death or did he defeat missingNo. I’m quite curious
Rushian
А можно пожалуйста на Русском
22:23 *Ultra Instict intensifies*
I'm surprised charmander was straight up just killed off
WE NEED CHARMANDER BAC!!!!!!!
The little guy just loves it.
Now for another 2 years of people yelling for the next episode. Keep up the good work! :D
After the episode 12. NEW SEASON2!!! xd
YOOOOOO A NEW EP THANKSSSSSS
Why, just why did charmander die?🥲
It took 2 years later for this and it was worth it
The series really "evolved" 😏
Ned traduction
OH YEAH now to wait for another 2 years
How could you kill charmander he was the best of the all
Great now we wait another 20 years for episode 11
This is actually the legend of shippiddge for being a legend
Yes starter squad for years finally episode 10
I hope it ends on a cliffhanger for the last epsode where Charmander is back leaving us wanting more
"SOMETHING."
Now this is an incredible story. I hope it can continue for as long as possible.
DAMN I KNEW ONE DAY HE WOULD EVOLVE!
Lol
Why why did charmander have to die
Well, that was... a lot. In a good way!
Can't wait for pt 11    Great job on all episodes they are quite funny bird?
It felt like 10 years
LIKE JESUS COMING OUT OF THAT CAVE THIS MAN RETURNED DESPITE EVERYBODY THINKING HE WAS GONE
I hope charmander and bulbasaur come back
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Charmander have to die I want him to be Charizard
Why is char is stupid
Why did they kill the fire lizard
What happened to bulbasaur
So in these stories the grass type chooses not to join the journey and the fire type always dies
Dam
charmander actually died really :(
Mewtwo is still just chilling in the cave waiting for charmander and bulbasaur
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR EYARS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why did you kill up charmander Bring him back Please
YES FINALLY
Make ep 11 NOW
Wow
22:58 Abamasnow: WHAT THE FU-
I want more this was the best ep yet
Charmender no 😢😢
After years and years of waiting
Bring back I'm a bird
ITS FINALLY HERE HOKY SHIT
YOOO
24:19 someone make a meme out of that
This made my year
Finally
PLEASE MAKE AN 11, I love this series. also i simp for blue shell man guy
Prediction: once the gods are defeated by wartortle he will take a revive, not knowing what it is, as a trophy. He will visit the site where charmander died, and accidentally drop the stone where he was. This awakens charmander, and hopefully they get to save bulbasaur as well. :>
I can not without charmander 😪😪
Change the pokemon world rules so the starting trainer can pick all 3 starters. OwO
I am excited for what’s next.  I hope it isn’t another long wait.
That.. was.. AWESOME!!!!
he is warturtle now
calling it now,warturtle is going to get send back in time by arceus/dialga-the gods- so he can fix they fuck up in theiryouth,starting probably right before missingNO as its going to become the greatest threat the world has ever seen.
FINALLLLLLLY
Charmander really died😭😭
wait, when hitmonchan went into that MissingNo. realm thing, missingno. was there, I know this is a dumb theory but what if there was a Pokémon before charmander that did the same thing and made missingno. Appear
The Bidoofs are soooo cute!! 😭😭😭
Is this One Punch Man ?
I didnt even know they made new episode man i havent watched this parody in such a long time when are you going to end it and how many episodes are their going to be, or is it going to be like real pokemon where you have like 40 or even 60 episodes Shippidge?
What I'd pay just to see this as an actual fully fledged and funded series on Adult Swim
Can't wait for Ep 11 and 12.
when the giant snow monster pulled out the dead chimchar, i thought squirtle would just say “oh, hes dead” and walk away
This was amazing so worth the wait
dude i be here waiting for a 11 ep and y charmander he was my fav
Is charmander dead
HOLY CRAP
I really like this series
YES ITS HERE
Now I wandered when the next episode will come out
Ep.11 idea: Starter squad vs Missingno
I wish charmander would have survived but who knows
i love this serie
when comes ep 11
I hope dialga is at the top
God Of Wartortle :D?!
clap clap
I'm confused. What the hell is this?
When you will release ep.11?
Is chimchar dead or not
What the fu
I call cap
He probably going to talk to Arceus and probably have Dialga send him back in time and save Charmender.
Please kill that fucking caterpie
And why caterpie is wearing charmendar head
But why charmendar die
This was a banger but…… r.I.p
Gonna wait for another 2 years for ep 11.. nice
Yes finally!
After 2 years finally  I am still sed for Charmander  and chimchar
OMGG FINNALLY!!
I loved this episode. I always felt the idea of above good and evil was stupid. The speech at the end would be the one I would want to be said to the gods of destruction in dragon ball super, since they are basically space nazis who kill millions of people and they excuse their actions of being part of the “greater good”.
its been a year and finnaly ep 10 was release
please do ep.11
Bidoof is my favorite Pokémon
Plz don't make us wait another year
when i see squirtle fighting snow in my head: doesn't squirtle like 98 lvl he already out lvl the god when they spawn in game
2 years of waiting and it comes out
omg finnally
Man I can't believe they kill Charmander 😢
Plssssssssssssss ep 11 plsssssssssss i love your videos plssssssssss
Rip charizard
how many years have been? XD
When new video ???
Finally god damn
THIS CAME OUT A WEEK AGO-
pls dont take years for the next episode
The way squirtle's eyes are now darker than before and how he's got a few scratches and scars on his shell really shows how much squirtle's been through- I feel really sad though that they killed off charmander but I can see that it's not really something to dwell on for too long as even if charmander attacked the caterpie to get his friends back- the rest of the damages he's done doesn't have a proper excuse- Overall I didn't expect so much drama from this series
Finaly thé king has returned
R.i.p Charmander
Can’t wait for more episodes! 🔥
So what happened to bulbasaur exactly? I mean we were told he got the happiest ending and got to stay with them, but they all died or left so where did he go?
"War"turtle=kratos
No charmendar
Where is mudkip
“Who’s that Pokémon?” Spirtle: it’s stickle!!! “It’s Turtwig!!!” “Fuuuuuuuuuuu-“
great animating
Do y’all realize how many years I’ve waited for this?!?!?
Hi
I feel like this series would make for a great Netflix adaption. Amazing work to the whole team! Can't wait for more!
NO WAYY
finally episode 10 is out
Support the starter squad
I love this
I need a new episode now.
SOMETHING
We better not have to wait another 2 years
I mean personally, I hated this episode, congrats on releasing but killing Charmander ruined it for me personally. I only watched because I found him hilarious now that he's gone it's pretty boring :(
A lot of people say charmander is being revived and a lot of people are saying he won’t.  Here’s the thing, mewtwo still needs charmander to clean his mess that is missingno.  A lot of people are also saying that Squirtle is in Sinnoh because of Char and Turtwig and the mountain. But a mountain has been shown in the background since like episode 3-ish. So he’s likely still in kanto.  I personally think mewtwo will bring back Charmander as a Charizard to clean up his mess and that way (now) wartortle and hopefully bulbasaur can all regroup and be friends once more but in the end mewtwo will return charmander to being dead.  I see this as the best outcome that doesn’t just disregard the fact that he died
Noice
he did it the crazy bastard finally did it.
*Wanna bet it's just Mewtwo up there?*
*Rappers that eminem was afraid to diss*
R.I.P original starter squad team. . .
I loved this episode
22:58 what the f-
leave a comment if you will wait  another year to watch another episode.
Been waiting so long for this
Squirtle went super squirtle
See you in two years for the next episode folks.
Wow is it just me or does the animation look different
Best episode! You don't have to make another one. After the first 9, I wanted more. This was satisfying. Logan Paul has a tattoo of Squirtle. I'm sure he would want to see it.
Finally
Charmander nooo
16:33 *slaps once * You have been bested in combat
I NEED MORE
This is also shocking because this all started when charmander killed some dumb Worm and as charmander said, “This is the wild if you want to Survivor out here you got a learn to toughen up.” And clearly in that worm didn’t toughen up.
OH MY GOD ITS HERE HOLY SHIT IM FREAKING OUT
please just dont post episode 11 in 3 years again im 15 now i was 12 when i watched the episode 9
How did the worn have any simpathy if he had that he would have not done the same as him
Sqirtle deserve what he got he never even listened to what charm Andre was saying
The caterpie flash backs were so sad, the last one gave me pain in my stomach
What Kind of Mystery Dungeon is this??
I started watching this series like 6 months ago and I love this show. Good job! (I can’t believe charmander is dead) I can’t wait for episode 11 & 12 !😁
They ruined it
Theres a loop hole cuz Charmander still has to meet with Mewto
It's almost a week ..... please post new episode
24:20 the music was so cool what is it called because this hits hard that go crazy man love that song.
LETS GO
time to wait 2 more years for the next episode
Been 2 years
Ok I'm happy it came out but it took like.... 3 years....
My man squirtle on his kratos shit
Is he having a flashback 😂😂😂
Also Caterpie are the worst person to
HE IS GONNA TRY TO REVIVE CHARMANDAR
You’re the worst person ever Squirtle
Yeah Squirtle sure you know a lot about Friends like how you kill yours
Please make more this was awesome
Maby mewtwo can bring him back remember sarullean cave
Why did you kill Charmander 😭🤧
Squirrel you killed Charmander I hate you more than anything
The fire Monke sounds like Tails
I swear this is becoming an anime
Ep 11 please
Broke my heart charmander died. He is my favorite character here. Almost like he has been replaced…
Your kidding. About damn time- you boys ready for another year long wait?
Is it just me or did you see mewtwo
I hope charmander comes back to life
OMG FINNALY
22:45 that scream
I have a theory that Charmander made a pact with MewTwo becoming some sort of diety figure and when Wartortle goes up to fight it'll be charmander or maybe charizard leaving him to only evolve one more time....but at the final he won't be able to win and Chimchar will use a power he has inside of him and end it all
Me First Seing This Being Uploaded: Alreight Its Been 1 year, This Better Be Fire
...But did dirtle die tho?...
I meant to say is
When os ep 11 coming bro
FINALLY TYSM FOR MAKING THIS!!!
Wow 10 years passed in this story, almost as long as Chapter 9
at the end I thought i was watching Shell of war.
Plz make charmandr back into the store plz
So. A year later you decide to make episode 10? Props to you.
Yay it’s back!
Wow, I keep laughing about caterpie's magikarp hat, until it hit me. Noooooooooooo, charmander!!!! I can't believe the last episode came out 2 years. I could've sworn the last two came earlier this year. And they keep becoming longer and better, the last one is going to be a 3 hour Pixar-like animation movie.
Damn.
Wat a second didn’t charmader start his evolution at the end of last episode
ITS BACK
Nooooooo charmander
this threw me off but what happened with bulbasaur?
AHHH NOSTALGIA
bruh TEN YEARS??!!
Hope a new one comes out soon
Had honestly forgot about this until this came out
Ghgjj he ghh J CD  do g G go   Fggghgjggt TV shh    M                        Thank goodness goodness thank goodness we have a lot on       M
I almost cried but that ending was amazing you deserve more subs
this is gone down hill i like the others but charmander shouldnt have dide and squrtle shouldnt evolved and defeated the giant just by evolved he wouldnt become like a god
Nevermind I didn't see your grass has it but how determined to die was it in episode 9
Happens to Charmander and Bulbasaur why didn't you characters in on the old ones and why is squirtles shell broken kind of crap
Wait a minute if Charmander is like the main character could that mean he comes back to life -ps I think charmander is the main character to me-
I’m surprised that Gary wasn’t in this, if Gary was then charmander wouldn’t be killing ceterpie and making his own team but then r.i.p charmander
11
Who saw mewtwo and missigno fighting?!
hmmmmmm
When episode 11 be released?
I wonder if mewto is still waiting for charmendar.
Charmander died trying to save squirtle and squirtle didn't even let him say I came to save you.
i knew i recognized the snover voice the second i heard it.
How did that stupid worm ever get a following??
Charmander😥
Nuova stagione vai cosi
See you in 2023 shippiddge
😍
I feel like there's more untold despair Squirtle faced in those 10 years; he's in Sinnoh now, and that might mean he tried this before in Johto and Hoenn with their respective region starters.
Oh fuck you man. You can't make every episode massively better than the last one
Can you make a season 2 please
Charmander noooooo why why 😭😭😭
amazing
I need the sound track to this episode
Thx for episode 10 but last time I checked Charmander was the main character not squirtul so u can't just kill him think it's jus going to b ok and not only that but getting rid of Bulbasaur too that's just outrageous and then u put in a stick turtle and a fire monkey to fill there places 😡😡😡💢😡💢😡💢😡💢... U DONE MESTED UP
Is it just me or did anybody see battle scars on him?
Now we have to wait ten years for another one to come out
an EPIC pokemon story that I can tell my son when it the end
My theory: Bluey will meet Dialga and they will fight or something so he can prove that he is worthy of being able to fix their errors in the past
Well that was cool see you in like 2024 lol
Is it just me or does this "Blue shell man guy" sound like "Blue Shirt guy" (Played by Ryan Reynolds) from Free Guy... Also,  I can see a lot of similarities between the two... The level-ups, the mourning, the regret, the desire, the feeling that they are in a game, the life inside a loop which involves following orders and doing what they're TOLD to do rather than doing what they like doing... Also In free guy, {*SPOILER ALERT*)    Guy's supposedly "Dead friend" returns alive at the end of the movie... So I am starting to think there will be a way in which Charmander returns and hopefully Shippiddge gives us the happy ending that we deserve (and the revenge-ish ending that Charmander deserved)
Ultra instinct Wartortle is going to avenge  chimchars death
Shippidge You improved this was Better than any other of you Animations i mean its Been 2 years still Congrats on Finnishing this Animation and stay safe
Yaaaas
finally
12:51 breh i saw mewtwo
Why charmander my favorite Pokémon
The time has come
To be fair to Squirtle, Stickle's a very forgettable pokemon..
Seriously the dedication to this series and it’s fans is unheard of! Thank you sooo much for your amazing work!
some one can reserect charmander with fosel machein
Two more years to go
i hate caterpie
I hope Charmander return in future episodes
I can't wait for the next part
12:51 that's how charmander is coming back probably
People complain about the wait fail to realize how much money is involved in making these type of videos. The wait really does suck but you gotta think about the money involved. It would be awesome maybe if more people helped out on his patron then we could get the episodes out quicker
ep 1 - 9 where much better.
Wow, my favorite episode.
where are squirtle, bulbasaur and charmander?!
Charmander still has an unfinished business with Mewtwo. Hopefully he will come back in the future episodes.
ITS TOO SAD CHARMANDER DIED I THOUGHT HE WOULD EVOLVE INTO CHARMELEON
I want a Snover plushie so bad now 😂
Charmander is missing no. At least I think that's how he comes back, maybe mewtwo finally defeats missing no, which somehow brings char back. Possibly in cerulean cave
When I saw Charmander head I was shocked and sad he could've stay around for bit with squirtle. But let me say this Squirtle is 98 level?! For real!
The production value is great, there's no deny of that.  But in my mind Starter Squad should've been just a short a sweet series with the three starters doing dumb stuff in the pokemon world, I wasn't expecting a 30 minute episode and go this deep with the story
please bring back charmander with mew2 bringing him back then the get bulbasur again
Finally this is what i've been waiting for
This was like The Avengers. Hahaha. Squirtle Endgame
Diglett vs Squirtle
"I was/am just following orders." - Says every drone who upholds evil.
Wartortle is boutta go FULL Kratos
How to make this
Level 98 just so he could evolve twice lmao. Next stop, Blastoise.
Wow squirtle has evolution
Omg finally
Plot twist  charmless head is controlling the catirpe
So all fire types are assholes and wartortel = kratos
Great episode, I’ll see you in three years :)
:(
the wait is finally over yesssss
Imagine the Pokemon gods are legendary pokemon and the legendary pokemon had powers to bring pokemon back from the dead and the legendary pokemon brung charmander and Bulbasaur back
DUDE ITS BEEENN N SOOOOOO LONGGGGVJURVJURGMVJOFRMIPCMEDCOIEDMCOIMED YESSSS
K      J 4
12:51 Mewtwo ?????
Pokémon need to hire this guy ASAP.
When will next episode come?
the fact that chamander is dead it breaks my heart
imma be honest: it’s a shame that Charmander had to die. I would’ve really liked to know what his biggest fear is (as we’re hinted at in episode 8).  I mean, it’s obviously trainers. But what did this one do to him that made him outright resent them?  Even better question: what if, like demonstrated in this episode, he’s afraid of the authority and dominance trainers and other forms of hierarchy have over them.
6:10 is that bird's voice actor the same voice actor for borderlands' psychos? I swear he is.
Whoever voices the talking trees has top tier voice acting
13:24 - "I knew you weren't ready for the stone. What a shame."  Nidorina can only evolve into Nidoqueen when exposed to a Moon Stone. I love the implications of that line. Especially when you remember that Leonard isn't just a random Caterpie. He's the one who was struggling with training in Episode 7. Whiskers believed in him then, and she couldn't kill him now.  God, the detail in the writing and animation has come along so well. Amazing job to everyone involved!
FINALLY
Man, why are people complaining about Charmander dying ? He's character arc ended after he tried peace negotiations with Caterpies and spared Whiskers (Which also lead to his demise). What did you want, a perfect peaceful happy ending ? It never goes like that in real life, Charmander must pay for his sins or just passed away due to tragedy. That's just how it is. And seeing Squirtle's growth (And downfall considering how many people he killed and is now going to ask gods to revive his friends) perfectly keeps Charmander's spirit but with a twist. People don't understand how incredible this writing is.
These were my childhood favorites
does charmender alive
Charmander's dead? What is this, Gamre of Thrones?
Please tell me this isn’t the end  I wanna see wartortle kick some ass
i got 1 question is this the final part of pokmon
I hope bulbasaur is ok. Charmander dying is sad but like he was a real dick sometimes but Bulbasaur did nothing. Sure him not wearing Pablo as a hat may have cause the war to never happens buts lots of other things could’ve stopped it too
Wait why does this look like bdsp graphics
Yay the series is back 😁
12:50 is that mewtwo fighting missingno?
idk if ur gonna see this but pls bring back charmander
Finally!!! I've been waiting a long time for a new episode of this!! :D
Wow this guy is back
The Snover's voice had me dead 😂😂😂☠
This was such a crazy episode the fact they killed charmander and squrtle was like a slave for battle then finding more pokemon to be friends with and then him evolving. It was just so good and such a cool way to start back the series
I guess Mewtwo is going to be waiting in that Cave forever.  Mewtwo: Where the fuck is that charmander!? Red:Human Human! Mewtwo:Who the hell are you!?
His name is squirtel
after two years FINALLY
Get back charmendar
Well this was an interesting turn for the series
when is episode 11 and only 2 episodes left oh man
I can’t wait for the 11th one, but who knows when it’ll come out
i love this series.
Holyyysh*t I almost forgot this series exist and now I'm lost, maybe it's time to rewatch the last episodes. New episode is on fire tho🔥
IT'S BACK :D
After 2 years
FINALLY MY CHILDHOOD CAME BACK
11:09 - "You're just using us to relive your stupid childhood."  This one hit hard because I myself have tried to relive my childhood too.
Literally every line that came out of wartortle’s mouth hit on a different level
I’m not watching this anymore cause charmander
How to Make Classic Cheesecake  You only need a few basic staple ingredients for this cheesecake recipe.  Block cream cheese: Four 8-ounce blocks of full-fat cream cheese are the base of this cheesecake. That’s 2 pounds. Make sure you’re buying the blocks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread. There’s no diets allowed in cheesecake, so don’t pick up the reduced fat variety! Sugar: 1 cup.  Not that much considering how many mouths you can feed with this dessert. Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. Using only 1 cup of sugar gives this cheesecake the opportunity to balance tangy and sweet, just as classic cheesecake should taste. Sour cream: 1 cup. I recently tested a cheesecake recipe with 1 cup of heavy cream instead, but ended up sticking with my original (which can be found here with blueberry swirls!). I was curious about the heavy cream addition and figured it would yield a softer cheesecake bite. The cheesecake was soft, but lacked the stability and richness I wanted. It was almost too creamy. Sour cream is most definitely the right choice. A little flavor: 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice. The lemon juice brightens up the cheesecake’s overall flavor and vanilla is always a good idea.  Eggs: 3 eggs are the final ingredient. You’ll beat the eggs in last, one at a time, until they are *just* incorporated. Do not overmix the batter once the eggs are added. This will whip air into the cheesecake batter, resulting in cheesecake cracking and deflating. And as always, make sure all of the cheesecake batter ingredients are at room temperature so the batter remains smooth, even, and combines quickly. Beating cold ingredients together will result in a chunky over-beaten cheesecake batter, hardly the way we want to start!
Wait does this mean we will get an other episode in 2 years nice
12:51 so that is what happens to hitmonchan
Yoooooooooo welcome back to a legendary piece ty sm for not abandoning the project
that's DUM character was the best 1 facts
I’ve waited for a year and now it’s here
Yay more lore
How did I end up here?
13:30 Ice split!
21:22 First time she called some pokémon by name.
Holy shit....charmander actually died....all he wanted was his homie back. Also I think the water gun triggered Squirtles PTSD? And he keeps calling chimchar, Char.
THE WAIT IS OVER YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY! IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Algorithm comment Still incredible animation and voice over. Effects are on point. Id like to criticize something but i really can't. Its just awesome as a hole.
so charmander died and squirtle is now old?? in the 4th gen??
I still hate y’all for killing charmander.
holy shit this is way deeper than I ever thought
Awesome  Edit: it is. But the comment is only for the algorithm
Why is no mander
I hate that charmander actually died 😪
Now we must wait another 4 years for a new episode 😕
What happened to the charmander and brussel sprouts?
I feel like the 2 year wait was like us not watching what was happening between the episodes because ALOT happened between ep.9 and ep.10
nooh Charmander died sobs but I'm still happy this series continues on.
LETS GOOO
time to wait another 3 years
Why charmander😭
See you guys in 2 years for episode 11?
Charmander became an anti hero where his death felt like it was Joel from The Last of us and Squirtle had a very different life at the end of the war in the form of Kratos from God of War 4, although in reality he has almost no no sense comparing both games with the chapter, a personal opinion was nothing else
NAAA SI CHARMANDER ESTA MUERTO, YA NO VALE LA PENA SEGUIR VIENDO LA HISTORIA :/
Squirtle hut puberty😎
Chimchar better survive, you can't just kill Charmander then my favorite pokemon.
One year delay.
Rip Charmander also never thought this would come back
How long to create episode 11
I love the episodes and all you guys have made and done... But theres just few questions for me left.. What happened to glitch hitmonchan + haunter? When Mewtwo told Charmander to fix it and come to Cerulean Cave, wasn't he able to see all this? I am deeply confused... I wanna see what comes next!
FINNALLYYYYYY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Can you make episode 11
soo good
Pls do ep 11
I got a theory. The deities are described as 'gods'. Doesn't necessarily mean it's arceus though. It could very well be Palkia, Dialga or Giratina for some reason. This could work with the story very well. Dialga can take squirtle back in time to change his mistakes, Palkia could restore the region destroyed by caterpie and my best guess for giratina if it helps at all is to take charmander from the underworld along with chimchar. Also, squirrel has run into Mewtwo before and if Mewtwo does help at all whatsoever, he'd probably teleport squirtle to the trio/duo and threaten them to do as squirtle needs
Season 2 off with a banger.
Wait they never returned to mewtwo
Why doesn’t squirtel just use a revive on charmander and chim char
When I saw Caterpie I thought “that’s a cool hat”  It wasn’t a cool hat  It was so uncool of a hat that even bulbasaur wouldn’t find it neat
Is it every week every month like when is it
16:44 epic fight scene
Make episode 11 you have 2 missing episode
Plz give us so 11 I bet u he will ask the gods to reassuruct his friends
I need episode 11
Make a episode 11
Now time to wait a other 2 years
I felt so much emotion when squirtle said "Shut up bulbasaur"
thank god I thought that fire monkey was the reincarnation of charmander
Squirtil should ask to make chitchat dead body into charmander
Please do more I love this XD
Well  only has two options 1 get revenge  2 Go to mew to turn back Time to convince his past self to let Charmander be picked first in stay in the lab forever
I think Charmander might come back.....
i am sad he diead
i love charmander
Gonzo voicing Bluey and Bill Nighy voicing Snow was a bold choice. I like it.
finally!
Mega
A
Is
AHH FINALLY OMG IM FREAKING OUT OMG OMG 0OMG
Abombisnow
I just watched the entire series for the first time today and wow I didn’t expect this to end up being so dark
I don't know japanese but I'm guessing that snow's gods are just Dialga and Palkia, so maybe he'll go back in time or whatever  But that's just my theory
I have no idea how this guy doesn't have 1M yet, he literally works for YEARS creating these videos for us, so everyone who doesn't subscribe to him, please do I bet he will be so happy and he deserves that Golden Play Button!
If only squirtle would have listened when charmader wanted the tell him what he was actually doing 😥😭
It’s so humbling to just rewatch episode 1 and just remember where it all started
What happened to mudkip
YAY ❤❤❤❤
Honestly like I understand why people dislike charmander as a character but like god this guy was awesome, and he died trying to save his friend and his friend let a fucking worm end his life
“At the end squirtle’s balls dropped a lot.”
IT BEEN YEAR
Let's go the legends have spoken!!
By the gods this series has taken one helluva turn and not for the worse. We are with you Blue Shell Man Guy, go kick their asses.
I can’t believe they killed him off 😭
so squirtle is now basically level 99 and defeated uhh gmax OBAMA snow i guess or whatever
I waited like a year lol
12:50..? LOL
wait this is still going on? last time  i saw this was when i was like 8
I mean why did bulbisaur not stay with squairtle
what happened to venasuar
Warturtle is epic
Wen is  episode 11 will Came out
They killed charmander and chi char this Chanel sucks
No fajnie że jest kontynuacja ale w mi żal biednego coromandel a a poza tym niczym czarny zginął więc ciekawe jak potoczy się historia lajkujcie żeby widział
Tak!!!
The start of Season 2
I like how I was 19 when episode 1 came out and now I’m 27 and episode 10 just came out loll. Great series though.
It’s back yes! Holy f nya!
I absolutely love the way this series is turning out I hope that later in the series he goes up against legendary Pokémon’s that supposedly make the rules about the Pokémon word and eventually leads to him having made contact with the creator of pokemons and also is sent on missions to undo the catastrophe that charmander has done for the mistake of letting charmander die and the whole Forrest!!!!
-_-
Finally the next episode I'm so happy
Finally you made another video after one year
Can you make a starter Squad episode 11 I'd I'd really like to see Charmander get Revived since there is an item in a Pokémon called a revive so I'd really like to see Charmander coming back more stronger it than ever and potentially evolve
Really hope Turtwig returns
I just want ep 11 to come out already this series is amazing
YES FINALLY AFTER 1-2 YEARS OF WAITING WE FINALLY GOT EP 10!!!
See you next year 😁
Beatifull
Wartortle was such a badass. I'd fear the ones who try to defy him.  Snow way. There's snow in the way. Me before the boss reveal: There's snow everywhere and it's not that deep?
I waited so long for episode 11 up Marx 11 and 12
This was  cool ı can’t wait for part 11
When is next episode
time to wait another year 😀
when i realised that charmander died i cried
AFTER ONE YEAR YOU ARE BACK!
12:50 Mewtwo??
Let’s gooooo
I love watching cute pokemon beating each other to death
Two years
ko
Sad rip chamander
So is Bulbasaur still alive
He should wish for Charmander to come back
That was epic dope series don't end it yet
plz do ep 11 soon
I wish charmander didn't die And I miss bullbasur, I spelling is correct I guess
I hope there is a massive reset
So... episode 11 will be in 2022 or 2023 and then episode 12 will be in 2024 or 2025?
The trees lmao
THEORY: Squirtle threw bidoof in the beginning. Towards the mountain. Bidoof is a god. There are gods on top of the mountain. BIDOOF IS THE GOD ON THE MOUNTAIN
I'm going to ask.... Something the most epic line muttered in Pokémon
This is an amazing piece of work.
What if squirtle asks dialga to go back in time?
this was just great.. but the fact that charmander didnt get revived by mewtwo is just.. come on now
Theory for next ep:worturtle  will battle the gods and be respected for his lifetime and will evolve in maybe ep 16 and then he will be give mega stone and become the super water god
this is so amazing everything comedy the sfx the camera following each situation perfectly you have such a gift
what are u gonna ask Wartortle:................. something Me: XD
22:20 squirtle becomes lord jesus himself
God of war ragnarok footage
If this means that squirtle is level 99 now, then what happens if he turns to blastoise and becomes level 100
My man being badass
episode 11 i want
I wanna get some kind of hope soon for a next episode because if he is gonna take multiple years off for that last 2 episodes I wanna know but if it comes in like next February then would still be great to know  Just wanna get a overall feel for how long it could take
I like how its been 10 years and they ain't evolved. And he isn't yet 100
*Sigh* I suppose I can wait another 2 years for a episode
It's Dark
Its been 4000 years
rip charmander was my favorite one lmfao
Wow pls meik part 11
2:33 so long eh bidoof
FIANLLY AFTER 2 YEARS
Now it's just a matter of waiting even longer for episode 11. Keep up the good work though!
Damn the episode was good but I need them to meet mewtwo and finish the glitch thing
OMG FINALLY
Do anyone have the name for the song in the end credits? They It’s amazing and I want to hear more.
That's something you should ask is to bring Charmander and Chimchar back
One word: “Brilliant.”
damm charmander was my favorite one 💔
At 12:52 you can actually see mewtwo
rip charmender
Whoa this is the bad ending right? How do I do the good ending?
Finally ep.10
Squirtle just became kratos And i love how squirtle when he was about to kill that abomasnow  He was like: WHAT THE F- BOOOOOOM Am really exited for next episode
My guess is wartortle is going to be sent back in time to save Charmander and Bulbasaur or something like that in a couple of episodes.
Eps 11 pls
no ones really gonna watch theres no charmander or bulbasuar
WHAT HE IS NOT DEAD!?!!!!!!
THIS IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
plot twist : squirtle meet arceus and then as arceus to revive charmender
This new episode turned dark af with the flash backs but dayyuuummmmmmm yall really know how to keep us invested. Love how yall keep us on our toes!!! Love how yall keep me and the rest guessing how the story will unfold keep it up. You definitely God one forever fan right here!! Whatever happens next I can't wait to see how yall will keep the narrative going!!!! Been a while for the updated but it's so worth it. Please please keep true to what yall wanna share because it is definitely something special. I love it so damn much❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
This was certainly the best animated episode and one of the best written. That being said, it was also—to me—the most disappointing.  I'm hoping that this is all a big fakeout, because—I'll be honest—I'm not exactly fond of the idea for sticking with characters and a storyline for nine episodes, waiting excitedly to see where it goes next for two years, and then having that whole storyline arc thrown away and basically reduced to a few flashbacks for a completely different plot. This works much better as a pilot for a Season 2 (if there was one) than it does as the tenth episode to an ongoing storyline.  I'm sure you don't want to hear that. And believe me, I still appreciate the incredible work you put into this. But this episode, for what strengths it has, can't help but leave a bad taste in my mouth after watching it.
Whatever happened to the worm things and chardzare
it’s so sad to see char dead ):
Great whats next? Guess I'll wait 3 years for it!
Well it was worth the wait
We need the next episode it is so amazing that i can't wait at all
great! I predict the next episode will release somewhere around january 2024.
If charmander makes a return im going to be really happy
But i am sad because it well be better if he was alive because he was not a starter squad
The was 100% worth it
I love how they made him level 98 so he went squirtle(98) wartortal(99) blastocyst (100
Wait wat the heck happend to charmander
2 more episodes to go
This episode was amazing I can’t wait for episode 11^^
To be continued…………….4 years later
Omg it finally back I sow happy now please continue do new series
It took u 1.1 years to make this
Finally episode 10
Squirtle... THAT TRAITOR >:(
FINALLY
Oh fking thank god char dead. I never hated a pokemon until i saw this version of char
after many years, finally we have episode 10
EPISODE ELEVEN
Plz just plz bring back charmander
When is ep11 come out
That's was epic!!! BLUESHELL GUY THE GOD OF WAR LMAO
Here we go again wait 1 more year 🤣
That was so GOOD bro. The message, so intense dude. Great work! Im excited to see what comes next!!!
FINALY its been like years or less since the last episode
I hope charmander returns at a point in this series i was very sad when charmander died so please let charmander returns...
Holy shit the snow tree guys are so funny like I was laughing out loud the hole time. It's like there trying to trying please everybody with the right amount kiss ass
Did anyone else see mewtwo or missingno at some point? I don’t remember when but it makes me hopeful that mewtwo will pull some strings and bring back Charmander
U are the best dude thanks for the whole series
13:43 "is he having a flash back" that line with that voice just makes comedic
When is ep 11 gonna come out
remember, this all happened because Red chose squirtle over charmander.
FINALLY OMG
Imagine how strong he would be if he evolved into blastiose
13:26 its just sad seeing caterpie use charmanders head
Wtf squirtle is already leevl 89
To be continued... In 2022
well next episode in one year  see you later
This is well-made, but still depressing. Like, this is especially depressing.
the gods have answered our wishes
Finally
If chimchar gets resurrected and isn't a bit great full I'm going to be sad
I miss charmander :(
It cant be....
😲🤯
Snow was a great character and actually merciful.  I wonder if Squirtle went with similar adventures with the gen 2 and 3 starters and if they met a similar end
I never thought I’d see the day
HOLY CHIT FUCKING WOW IS THIS OVER I HOPE NOT
"its been so long, since i last have seen my son"
I really want a 11 12 13 and 14
Pokémon: The Squirtle God of destruction and revenge
wait, so am I gonna wait for another 2 years for the next episode? 🤔
Years waiting for this.. fucking worth it!
this one was the best one
A whole nearly 2 years later. Need to see bulbasaur be venasaur or ivysaur now lol
Yay now we have to wait a few more years
Omg fiinalllly
he's back
he has been hrre
28 minutes later..  Alright time to wait for another year
Amazing can you send episode 11and make charmender alive cause  i love fire pokemon
wow thanks for releasing number 10!
Doesn’t hit the same
Theory time  I’m guessing that the ending is going to have something to do with Mewtwo and Missingno. At 12:52 in the video you see Mewtwo “fighting” the missingno Hitmochan Haunter monster thing. Now what these two have to do with the series I don’t really know (leave your thoughts in the comments) but it’s so mysterious but obvious. Shippidge wouldn’t have these two in the series if they were not significant in some way. Like I said I don’t know what these two in the series do. All we have seen is that Missingno is what to me is trying to get into the world? And Mewtwo is trying to contain it. The only thing that I know of missingno and Mewtwo is that Mewtwo is trying to contain missingno. So I’m assuming he is bad. Anyways this is my theory/thoughts let me know what you guys think.
I been waiting for this…
BIIIIIIIIIRRRRDDDDD
I remembered when the first episode came out, and now this amazing stuff. Keep it up
I was waiting for this for so loooonnnngggg
I wouldn't even be shocked if that bidoof came back 2:35 just better be ready for anything at this point
My baby charmander is gone😢😢😢😢
Holy fuck the writing quality for this is insane legit sad I know I'll have to wait 2 years for the next episode lol.
Epic
Wartortle has a way deep voice than I'd imagine he'd have
finnaly!!!!
12:50 Mewtwo ?
Yesa
Nooo Charmander died  😭
Warturtle went into avatar state
#Teamseas
#Teamseas
wait question becuase im very curious so was episode 9 really the last episode with charmander being the main protagnist and the leader caterpie really defeated him... and so does that mean episode 10 11 and 12 is suppose to be a new phase in sinnoh where squirtle leads turtwig and chimchar... and also what about piplup?
#Teamseas
Omg this was the best episode yet I never expected the story to take such a dark turn and I’m loving it.
I have vague memories of watching Starter Squad at an age I probably shouldn't have been watching it (Emphasis on probably, I might've been over 13 when I watched I don't remember). Since the memories were such a blur I decided to binge the series again and it's much better than I remember actually. Great episode! Kinda broke me though Something I've been seeing in the comments is people thinking Charmander will be revived, but... I don't see it happening I feel like one of the key parts of this episode was Squirtle having to accept he can't just live in the past, and bringing Charmander back seems pretty counterproductive for that. I can see Squirtle trying to prevent Charmander's death with some time travel stuff but I don't think it'll work out, maybe even screwing the timeline and having to fix all that
6:05
i fucking waited a year omg you dont know how fucking happy i an right now
where 11
Many bulbesulaer is steal alive probably steal eating berrys and getting milked😶😵
i thought the creators were dead ..
It's back!
To think there's an actual 10 yr gap between the 1st and 4th generation.
Me when watching this: YES ANOTHER ONE LETS GOOO  me after watching it : damn looks like I'll have to wait another year 😞
Cant wait for the next ep see u in 2 years
Great work keep on doing this it’s great
Wait, uh, where
I watch this show 3 times a day
That it I can’t wait for another episode
Bro the tree’s are so annoying
Why do I feel disappointed after all of this wait :(
Don't forget french subtitles pls
"by the way, this is what you turn into when you die" >.>
That’s the biggest voice change from an evolution I’ve ever heard
Bring back charmader+bulbasaur
What happened to bulbasaur
You killed Charmander?!
How about episode 11
Ok Cool
When will another one come out?
This story has turned from fun and friendly(but sometimes crazy) story to a depressing but still cool story
WAIT A MOMENT IN EPISODE 8 HAUNTER TELL CHARMANDER HE WILL TURN INTO A GASTLY AFTER HE DIES
finally
Charmander :'(
When we needed him the most.... HE CAME BACK
I am sad that charmander died 🥺🥺
12:50 what is mewto doing in this
Alright see you guys in 3 years.
Snover sounds like Professor Science, only the REAL OGs know.
still curious on what mewtwo will do, he has to end up appearing sometime soon, maybe even revive charmander since he told charmander to fix the problem himself
Pls do and epesode 11
Watching this now leaves a huge question in my mind. What happened to the missingno problem? It’s been 10 years, charmander was sent to deal with it by mewtwo, but died by the caterpeas. Is mewtwo just resting cerulean cave, while missingno runs rampant. Squirltules definitely aren’t going to see him because he’s climbing a mountain. Bulbasuar couldn’t do anything anyway. What happened to missingno?
This whole episode is motivational & inspiring for me the dialogues are well written. it just stated squirtle dark past & how much progressive changes came in him in 10 yrs its just so immense & spectacular. Am really much overwhelmed by seeing all of it till now.💖🔥✌😊
E
did anyone else see mewtwo at 12:50?
i was so excited to watch this then i read like two comments and got spoiled immediately i hate it here
Second part please
Epic
I think MissingNo is at the top of the mountain killing legendaries (the “gods”) after having gained enough power over the last 10 years. MewTwo might even make his comeback alongside Charmander because MewTwo still doesn’t wanna clean up the mess Charmander made, and will maybe bring him back from the dead as the charizard he deserved to become
It’s crazy squirtle has such a strong sense of what the team is supposed to be after just letting charmander die and being the guy to ensure it would happen, following people who very OBVIOUSLY didnt care at all but used fake words to make him feel welcome
GO CHIMCHAR!!! one of the draw backs of the sinnoh was always the lack of fire types these snovers are a reminder of that is there a time frame on the next ep or is it still early?
Ive waited years for this
amazingly done and what a great story that highlights clandestine groups. This story needs to keep being told in order  to wake up more and more people.   Soon people will realize they're being controlled and do something about it.  But probably not
Wait, what
ANOTHER YEAR HAS COME AND GONE
Ep.11 pls :(
Miss chamander
Guys charmander isn't gone forever he'll be back you'll see
BEG*
PLEASE MAKE THEM GO BACK IN TIME SO SQUIRTL CAN SAVE CHARMANDER I BRGG YOUU
I can already tell where this story is heading I think it’s really amazing the squirtle decided to finally make his own choice
Welp, Charmander is never gonna meet up with Mewtwo in Cerulean cave
I hope this episode gots connection with episode 8
Mewtwo and Missingno at 12:50
Anyone has a feeling that charmander gonna come back? I mean haunter did hint out that charmander gonna die and that he gonna turn into a gastly and mewtwo problem still hasn’t solved so charmander either gonna come back and become an antagonist to squrtle betrayal or to clean up his mess.
No one dont care of chimichar
I WANT CHARMENDER PLEEASE
Ravive charmander
I can’t wait for part 11
Yay
ok now im gonna watch the next ep when my dad finds milk
I love charmander wayyyyyy you kil him😭😭😭😭😭😭
I need 11 now
O no Charmander
are you fucking kidding me ? i waited 2 years for this shit ? i fucking hate this whole 10 years later shit , why the hell did you have to make this episode if you are just gona do some time travel bullshit ? i dont care about what happens 10 fucking years later , i care about the story i was intrested in the start .
This has turned into God of war
Next episode: 2023
God I missed these
Finally
10 years later ep 11 is going to be out
NO WAY  it’s back?!? I need to see this
Charmander was my favorite character. So sad he was killed off
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING A YEAR
So are we going to have to wait another year for the next episode?
8:04 The viewers:
Why he die I miss charmander
ITS FINALLY TIME: SEASON 2!   Edit: i know it's not season 2, but it's been so long that it may as well be.
Squirtle is an opp
I can’t wait for episode 11 holy crap-WAIT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE US WAIT ANOTHER YEAR OH GOD
It's weird to think over a billion people have been born since this series began
So basically Charmander got betrayed by Squirtle pretty messed up R.i.p Charmander the badass of the  starter squad man Charmander could of became a great character but he got betrayed by Squirtle hopefully he makes a return to the starter squad series
Kick his butt wartotel
holy shit
Omg
This man is a legend
HEY EVERYBODY SUBSCRIBE
I hope he asks for chimchar  and charmander back so we can finally take a brake
Perfect timing for this video to come out considering the Gen 4 remakes
YESSSS FINALY!!! 🐕
Bidoof is the god because he’s up there because of squirtle
My opinions  on this series changed, it went from  charmander vs caterpies to chimchar vs beavers, smh
Petition Nintendo to hire this guy to make a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series
Mewtwo fighting the Glitch was one of my favourite. I wonder how it will turn out in the finale!!!!!!!
Crap this has made be to excited for the next one
COME HACK CHARMANDER
12:50 anybody else see mewtwo
Who els saw meow-two fighting the glitch in the background
I could finally watch the episode after a week. Holy shit what an rollercoaster of emotions and defently, the wait was worth it! Cant believe you killed me D: (German Charmander, if u still remember). Awesome Episode! But my guess is whatever is up there (probably Dialga, Palkia or Arceues) will somehow make a new timeline/travel back in time respectivly we will go back the to moment before Charlie got killed and Squirtle probably saving him this time. I hope atleast thats gonna happen :D
Now I understand why starters are so rare
its gna continue!
:( Please tell me Bulbasaur is somehow alive.
Charmander is the main character
Finally the return
We don’t find out is charmander is dead or not
12:51 lol
God of war Pokémon Addition
Great I waited a whole entire goddamn year just to see that Charmander is dead😀
I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT!!!
This reminds me of asura's wrath
What happened to charmander?
It’s
Wait, so what exactly is squirtle most afraid of?
worth da wait good shit
He will definitely evolve into blastoise because he is specifically level 98 lol
Go back to Bulbasaur pls 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩🥺😩🥺😩🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😩😩🥺😩🥺😩🥺😩
This episode is my new favorite. It just topped my old previous favorite (episode 8)  The reason I like episode 8 so much is it was prolly the funniest one. Had great humor, great storytelling, great characters, great for the plot as well with missingno and mewtwo etc.  But this episode just does so much, tons of humor, great storytelling, emotional, epic  It’s got it all
TWO YEARS!!!!!!!!........Congrats on the release though
OH WHOA! I hadn't seen any of the previous episodes and just checked this out just out of curiosity. Very interesting, very funny, very epic and cool stuff! I never liked Snover (or Abomasnow tbh), but I absolutely love the Snovers in this one. Hilarious. "Cold people are no match for hot people" is one of the most quotable phrases I've ever heard lol. I think because of this video, I like that evo-line a whole lot better. So thanks for the Snover's behalf! I was not ready for all the murder in the previous episodes that I binged today tho, although this should have probably prepared me.  I also loved that you referred to Arceus in its Japanese name. Very good choice, very satisfying to figure that out haha.  (sorry for any spelling mistakes, i'm not a native English-speaker and it's getting late for me ha)
I wonder charmander gonna come back as a Charizard
Bruh pls tell me charmander is alive
I’m guessing we’re gonna get some time travel based on the gods being described as creating space and time and also that flash of light and mewtwo showing up for a moment
14:51
Damn, Abomasnow (was that how it was called in english?) looks god damn HORRIFYING!!!
RIP next episode gonna be in 37 years.
I waited to long for this
his new voice startled me
good episode, plz release the next ASAP
Squirtle - from weakest pokemon to strongest.... In bw we all grew up
level 98 damn
Finally, The wait is over. Now we need to wait another year to get another episode let's go guys we have patients
Finally
Why did you kill charmander 😭😭😭bring him back he had to go see mewtwo his story isn’t done
Yeah finally the next episode
22:08 I was wishing so much he died it's like he is the main villian
Is charmander alive please make him alive and can bulbasaur come back as well and they can be the starter squad again if it’s only wartortle then the show should be called starter squad it should be called wartortle this show made me cry please make charmander alive again please and the squad needs to be back together
Thank you 🙏🏼
I really want the lizard to come back even if he is dead
Guys every year there will be a ep
14:31 “Truly our friends are the most replaceable we know!” says the snowver as they replace the other snowver.

Squirtle would literally try to move "mountains" for his friends. 😄
yo ur really making them longer every episode like about 4 minutes longer every epispde
My prediction- squirtle encounters Dialga who then sends squirtle back in time to save charmander.
bro why did you have to kill charmander smh he was the only reason why I watched these videos
"What is that?!" "THAT is snow"  "Do not talk to the treees!" I love this series, lol.
When is the next episodee
One Question: Who is The Main Character   A-Charmander B-Squirtle(Wartortle) C-None of The Above D-Charmander + Squirtle(Wartortle)
He be back
were is ep11
Nooooo the end
If you look closely at 12:50 you can see Mewtwo fighting unknown again
cant believe there has only been 10 episodes and the seiries is 8 years old
It's Finally here Less Goooo
See y'all in another year or so
Wth is this
I think bidoof will also be on top of Mount coronet because at the start of the episode squirtle throws a bidoof towards mount coronet
Snow was such a cool character (pun not intended). His idea, design, and voice were perfect. Kinda wanted him to live tbh.
I feel like squirtle will go to mewtwo to revive charmander and if bulbasaur is dead they’ll revive them to and they’ll all find good trainers in the end.
I nearly forgot about this series, I can't believe a pokemon animation i watched as a kid turn into an actual great story with a crazy fucking plot
Yooooo finally
Does this mean charmander is a gastly because the haunter said in ep 8 that you turn into a gastly after you die
is there going to be a episode 11
:( R I p ch
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Release ep 11
22:58 he almost sweared there
1:20 big biby
"Always Remember turtwig I hate you both more than ever" Gets me every time lol
FINALLY AUO
im very dissapointed in this episode
LETS GO final yessss
When is the next episode 11
Why did you make Charmander die
never thought the animation could get better after 9, but ive been proven wrong. im excited for 11 and 12!
Yo finally
Es geht weiter endlich
I miss charmander
Since when did abomasnow turned into a legendary pokemon
AHHHHHH EPISODE 10‼️‼️
Don’t worry only another 2 years
When the world needed him the most he appeared! After like.. 3 years?
Finaly this video come
Why is charmander dead??
Bring back charmander and bulbusaure please
Im about quit after charmander dies
I hate you so much why did you make this because charmander is my favorite pokemon
Finally
4:02 - 4:08 either Chimchar was projecting his insecurities on Turtwig or he was just being a jerk Or both
Let's go bro I've waited for this for 2 years hahahaha
why did charmander have to die
All cool but I didn’t like charmander’s death
NOOOOOOOOO CHARMANDER ACTUALLY DIED
This is such a fun, awesome, series! Can't wait for the next episode! Keep up the good work!
it’s been forever and now i’m finally happy
Cant wait for ep 11
Chimchar is ungrateful little brat
I have a feeling charmander is gonna get revived by Mewtwo to fix the glitch
I have. Been watching this whole series for all 7 years lmao I’m 14 in high school I was like 6-7 in second grade lol squirtle finally evolved lol
you can make tyht the other pokemon got is red when he is op and knows pokemon language
Epic
P
i will kill every single carterpe i see in pokemon
This won't be the end, will it
now i can stop pissing my pants and watch an episode in my room, not in my toilets.  (Yes i watched every episode while pissing lol)
i first watched this series when i was 6. life has changed so much but somehow i always end up finding the newest episode.
Now we wait 2 years for the next episode lol
Congrats on bulbasaur for having a happy ending
I literally just told my friend about this series and how there hasn't been a new episode in a while.  Not only did you prove me wrong, but it was AMAZING!  Well worth the wait.  This was excellent.  Can't wait for the next one!
You either thought of something or got really really lazy and wanted to end it so you just did that. Instead of having an *actual ending to the scene in episode 9*
When the doom music kicks in 22:21
Not to be rude but holy shit he's still alive
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!
WHOOOOOOO
lesson learned never be like charmander and chimchar or else your dead
AT LAST AFTER 5 YEARS WE GET EPISODE 10
The turtle dude is the new charmander with sass
Back to what charmander said start uploading faster
This entire series defines the power of friendship. See ya in 2 years guys.
Finaly new episode
I bet the gods are the legendary Pokémons
I never thought I’d shed tears over Starter Squad
Can’t believe Charmander is dead, bold move to kill off the protagonist after leaving us waiting for so long. Still, I’m looking forward to seeing where this series goes next.
Big bibby is my new favorite character
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel
I guess we know that charmander and bulbisour died
We just saw mewtwo right?
Jesus Christ.
Been watching this for 6 years now so hyped to see that you are back btw I'm 13 now
Finally it’s here and it was worth it can’t wait for the next one
welp, guess have to wait another year for another video
no, that can't be possible, charmander you it was my favorite pokemon squirtle vaute in time and impasse you almost kill the charmander please i want the charmander back
💚this was so good I cant wait for the next ep to come out.
you made 20 million people wait 8 years for less than 1 hours worth of footage
holy shiiiiii that was soo cool this is actually better than the real pokémon series
Can u make 11 ep is charmander save'd by mewtwo and the head on the caterpillar is fake I really want charmander and bulbasaur
congrats on releasing ep 10! of course you make the ending another interesting cliffhanger that I just cannot wait until ep 11 comes out! Keep up the great work with this series and i'm so exited to see what you can come up with next
You probably won’t see this but I just want you to know that I heavily support this series, and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t watch fan made stuff at all. This series has me wanting more and I’m so stoked for the next two episodes! I’ve been showing anyone I know interested and they love it too. I’ve already watched through like 5 times and it gets better every time! Can’t wait for more, keep up the amazing work!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Charmander!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life my precious Charmander
Its over
Plz bring more episodes
Thank God the ep is here
And I dust wached it and my brother wached long time ago
This is good
What does the kanji caterpie wrote on the back of charmander's head mean? Btw I like how Wartortle has the "Batman voice".
We cant stop WAITING man add more EPISODES like 1 episode a week
Hey shipidgge, I have waited so long for a new episode and I love the style of your art, but I always need to wait a year or many months for a episode. Is there a way to speed up?
PLS ADD CHARMANDA BACK
I always knew that water type were the best starters
I love this starter squad and i am really sad charmendar died but the parody is going big quick please dont end it hope the gods give charmander back also bulbasur 😃😀😀
Up there might be arceus and maybe he Will revive chimichar and charmander
Let me predict the next title:  Bulbasaur in Viridian Forest War Arc - Starter Squad (Ep.11)
found out that the god that Snow was saying was Arceus
I think Squirtle might evolve i mean he's at lvl 98 meaning he can evolve twice jsut enough to become a Blastoise or might just stay as a lvl100 Squirtle liek a chad
Finally after a long time they come back!
It’s been 1 year, and it’s FINALLY HERE!
It's been less than 4 minutes and I already hate chimchar
I love this I whach one year ago
See u next year ep 11
Oh my god squirtle is going to revive charmander whilst doing so with chimchar
w końcu się doczekałem
WHEN 11 OUT
what happened to mewtwo and cerulian cave maybye mewtwo can brig back charmander
2 more left. i was 5 since starter squad eps 1 now im 13 dam.
Is it just me or does this feels a lot darker than before.
i love this series
Chamnder s death tho
The sadness and regret in squirtle’s face is just so hard to watch.
Oh no someone bout a die
After 2 jears my happines is bace
Ok so missing.no was mentioned 2 times in this and we know he is bassicaly a lump of code so i think he is the one on the top of the mountain i mean it makes a lot of sense
Next year we will find out what happens atop the mountain 😃
YEAH FINALLY!!
Long ago a lizard asked the question why wait to fight, something was different in him he learned to live and care through his friends actions but eventually his string of violence caught up to him, and before he his friend could see that he learned his lesson he perished..
so basically Squirtle is Kratos now lol
WHAAAT
The return
So he's at level 98 and not Blastoise?
pls revive charmander some how and bring back bulbasour and bring the old team plsssssssssssssss I beg!
She called Squirtle Bluey? WHERE’S BINGO
Gotta love it when a animation kills off your favorite character, just kidding this sucks. still love the idea though ig.
There is no way that stupid caterpie got everything he wanted.... such an annoying character too DX charmander noo!
BY THE LORD IT HAS RETURNED
I wish to see more but not continuing from episode 10 you should continue from when charmander died
Yoo this is wicked af🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was.. awesome! Can't wait for episode 11
Where is charmander?
Welp 2 fire types and 2 grass types leave Squirtle alone or maybe not…
that definitly hit differently without charmender, i was expecting something big, i'm really disapointed, but well it's only my point of view, the art and sound are still perfect but i'm not that much hyped anymore to follow this story
Finally, episode 10!
When I saw the ending of ep 9 I was almost about to cry
I've been waiting for this for sooo long
Took u like 2 to 3 years but thanks for giving a ep.10
i was hoping charmander wasnt dead, maybe he could be at the top making rules or somethin
Oh dam this is good
I hate him u never post video's
YESSSSSSS
Took u long enough…
When he said something and the music started... I had goosebumps however and can't wait for the 11tg episode already lol 😂
I graduated from college last time I saw one of these episodes
It’s good vids
The next one is bulbasur
12:50 i saw mewto
Well that got surprisingly dark and serious.
WHA THEY DID IT IT BOIS
Chumdar lol friendship reasons
HELL YEAH IT TOOK LONG ENOUGH WHOOOOOOO       I fudging love these series though kinda sad charmander died but theres always gotta be a plot twist to it keep going and youll reach a million subs in no time!
YOUR BACK LETZ GOOOOOOOOOO
the long awaited.
Where back yes
When will there be a new episode
I've been waiting for this
f in the chat for Charmander he will be missed🙏🏽😢
I hope charmander gets revived:(
"Oh cool what are you gonna ask?"  ... lmao i loved the trees lmao
Snow just said: WHAT THE FU—
MORE!
Remember an angry man is  a hungry man so he's hungry alright
From this, I can tell Squirtle really wished for things to have turned out differently, like saving Charmander. I wish this happens by running into some time rewinding pkmn to go back in time to make things right.
Yes.
I wish squirtle evolved into blastoise since he was a level 98
Creator you killed off the best part of the series, many swear words have been directed towards you now.  I have no further intrest.
Please continue its been  so long! Ive.been watching it from vid 1! I love this show and i cant wait 4 the last ep.
After 2 years it's here
It’s about time
Bro what are the chances I don't think about this guy for a year and I think of it less than a week after the new video comes out
Where is charmander
FINALLY
Wait how about charmander
I miss charmander
I see a pattern here ep.9 was about charmander and ep.10 was about squirtle that means ep.11 will be about bulbasaur
It feels like it's been so long, finally, ep 10 came out... wow... I almost forgot about this series
When r u going to make another video?
I been waiting for so long
I dont really know how to feel about this episode I like it but I dont at the same time. First off theres the 10 yr time skip. Thankfully the gap was told but I think there was so much potential for a different outcome of what happened for the war with the caterpie and charmander. Second off theres still 2 big things that are missing and that involves mewtwo, like how mewtwo told charmander and bulbasaur to get squirtle and all meet up at cerulean cave and stopping missingno but that didnt happen which was kinda stupid in my opinion to just scrap, that had so much potential. We did see a bit of a brawl between mewtwo and missingno in this episode with the flashback but we dont know the outcome of the fight, like come one who one? And lastly I dont know exactly how I feel about squirtle just going to sinnoh right after being in kanto, my theory is that in the next episode squirtle (warturtle now) will fight against arceus, palkia and dialga, win the fight and force dialga to send warturtle back in time to save charmander from caterpie. Then the next 2 episodes could pick back up on the missingno fight and that would be season 1 of the series.  Each region could be a season of it's own with new problems for the group.
Well, Charmander is slain (damn the Caterpie clan,...well apparently they pretty much damned themselves), Squirtle is evolved and lost more friends, and Bulbasaur is vanished from sight.......well, it was good while it lasted.
Wow, way to ruin the series in one episode.
When the world needed him most, *He returned*
Noooooo charmander😢😢😢
Yes this will end but nintendo needs to add u as programmer. U write secomd anime where ash learns from his environments. So pokemon with characters devolpment grow episode
Return of the king
i been waiting a year for the next video to upload watched sinced 2015
This is how you do a soft-reboot right. Fantastic job.
Wait.... Is Bulbasaur dead? I mean... Supreme Leader Caterpie did say he lost everything....  Regardless, this is amazing! Legitimately this series has better writing then some Hollywood productions, and the animation has just improved so much! I would say I can't wait for episode 11, but I can since it will definitely be worth it.
Omg
I wanted him to evolve ro charzard
I think mewtwo is on the top of the mountain and is going to bring charmander back because in episode 8 he made it clear to meet him in a cave and maybe it will prevent squirtle from his trauma
Who miss charmander
I feel like this episode came from someone saying wouldn't it be funny if we made a God of war reference with Wartortle and then someone said holy shit that's a great idea
Ok this easily has to be my Favorite Episode its so unexpected and epic
Holy shit, I never thought I could feel so much emotion for some worms and starter Pokémon. This is fucking incredible
YYYYYYOOOOOOOOOO 10/10
LETS GOOOOOOOOO CHILDHOOD RETURNED!
It’s been so long since I’ve seen these videos. I forgot this series existed, it’s been so long😭😭😭
Turtwig is right everyone thought squirtel  saved Chamrmander 🙃🙃
Every episode is worth the wait
But when the world neded him most he did not VANISH
This series is fire 🔥🔥🔥
for months i finally find it yay
can u bring charmander back? :(
Flashbacks look like what nazi Germany looked like in the last parts of World War 2. An industry of death no surrender no desertion while the leader looks like hitler telling everyone they will win
Why would the kill the mc
Like can you bring back charmander like is his brother that is dead
after rewatching the whole series, I wonder if Charmander is a ghost Pokémon now… it would be cool to see him as a fully evolved Gengar :D
Yessssssss it is here
Ya know if I didn't see Charmanders head on Caterpie I'd actually believe Charmander was waiting for Squirtle in the volcano being fire and all that. I still believe Charmander has something to do with the volcano, but I can't work out what since Charmander is definitely dead. Maybe I'm in denial?
Bro I wish charmander was alive to see squirtle become what he wanted him to
He killed charmander
Wow zi loved this change this is so epic
I disliked sorry I just liked charmander and I dont think you should have killed him
Fun fact at least bulbasaur is alive mean we are gonna see it in the next episode Cause why would caterpie kill bulbasaur  And also that mean big reunion is coming up
Seeing Charmander’s dismembered head on Caterpie is heartbreaking. He died valiantly, trying to get his friends back
its like charmander and his reincarnates are doomed to never evolve
omg i cant beilieve you finnally decided to finish! =3
TO WAR
OH MY GIDCWSIT EGAT
Pretty sure charmander survived somehow my theory is that pixel blur we saw was him in that dimension place
when the world needed him most he appeared.
Op bro 💯
What is the name to that music at the end bro it be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m getting some real God of War vibes
I hope the next episode will be out quicker
i dont know about you but i cryed when i saw this
Never make anyone wait like that again please
Finally they are back
I hope the next episode shows that charmander was reborn as a good charmander
Omg finally I’ve been waiting 2 years for this
whats the music where squirtle is walking up to the mountains in the end?
i now hate caterpies
The hollow nation connoly please because attack optically copy aside a redundant armenian. hulking, superficial birch
NOOOOOOOOOO
WAIT NO
where is charmander and bulbasaur?
IVE BEEN WAITING FINALLY
The damaging advantage kinetically avoid because fly likely surprise given a cut comparison. skillful, smooth burglar
squirtle got crushed by a giant tree who was super religious and went sicko mode after bud/turtwig left and chimchar died
This feeling like Infinity War or End Game is gonna kick off.
Make mewtwo go back in time to get charmander
I can't believe that mans dead 😔 bro we should go back in time so we can revive him
Why don't squirtle throw that ultra ball to caterpie?
Hamburger
24:20 what's the name of the music used here?
Can we just get a R.I.P for charmmander
2 more eps intell the seires end
Takes some balls to end Charmander episode and was good but u MUST bring back Charmander and Bulbasaur
THIS WAS AMAZING
What I think is on top of the mountain it could be dialga
I waited so long for this
What the fu- explosion
Thank you so much, I remember watching this so long ago when ep 1 came out
This actually teaches a life lesson
The lizard slayer: *having a monolog* Mewtwo with missingno: FUCKING SKODEN
This was totally worth the wait
NO WAY IDIDNT EVEN KNOW IT WAS OUT! I SHOULDVE SUBBED WITH NOTICICATIONS ON
#TeamSeas Pls Donate
i have been waiting 3 years
bro, imagine how long the next episode is going to take to come out
The song in dis  Endings is great
It’s here
What's the move Squirtle uses at 13:28?
Charmander died a hero (debatable) and Caterpie lived long enough to see himself become a villain.
Let’s go finally
Shippiddge:man this took a long time to make  The community:YESSSS ITS FINALLY HERE THANK YOU
I kinda feel bad for abomasnow (sorry if i spell the pokemon name wrong)
Why did warturtle not evolve into blastoise
YAY!!!!
If we have to wait another whole year for E11 I'm going to be upset😥
Bit of a hot take, but I miss the days when this was just a simple Pokemon parody.
Yes
This episode takes 1 year to make a next episode
When is ep 11? Tho
yes hes back
12:48 is when mewtwo appears
Dang this was pretty sad And I hope Bulbasaur had a happy ending and totally didn't burn in the fire
I need more
Yay I was waiting so long
More pls
"IM A BIIIIIIIIIRD!"
wow
I waited years for this so excited to watch this!
This is starting to have dark and creepy cult like under tones..... Half way through
Quando um pokémon morre ele vira um gastly ou gazy sei lá algo sei não é?
Noooooooo charmander
Shippiddge pleas make a contination of starter squad so everyone knows more about blue shell man guy and chimchar
Squirtle is lvl 98 and the likes for me is 98k so-
My god im late bye 6 days
I didn’t expect that they would really kill charmander and that Bulbasaur would have an happy ending or something but it was hella good
woohooo!!!
12:50 Some huge foreshadowing right there.....
It’s been a year bro
When will there be episode 11 because I hate being left on a cliffhanger also I love your videos man I can't wait tell you hit 1mil
Also i cant belive this channel doesnt have 1000000000000 subs
I've been waiting for this it's been so long 😯B-)(^^)
My happiness is back
idk how much time it was from your last pokemon video and finnaly episode 10 is here
*it came! It finally came!* I waited a year for this
I wana see charmander pls tell me hes alive
i love this series so much
This story is so awesome. Went from 3 starter Pokémon just wanting to evolve, to a Worturtle fighting Omniscient gods. The animation is on point and the effect's are amazing. This series has put a spot in my heart ever since I was five years old
what happens to Bulbasaur
6:12
YESS FINALY THE WAIT IS OVER
Finally
next episode: legend of green frog bulb guy
Finially! Yes!
Rip charmander he will be missed
This came out on my birthday!!!
Anyone see mewtew
Chimchar and turtwig are the sinnoh starters. Dialga is a sinnoh legendary. Time travel is going to occur, calling it now.
i hope there's another flashback on how squirtle reacted to charmander's death at the hands of the carterpie his cough cough trainer who never seams fight him say what you will about charmander he always fights them team mates but anyway great job and video 😒
My theory is that the Pokémon that is on top of the mountain is the Glitched Pokémon and Mewtwo that some how fused together and wartortle has to fight him.
Wait this the end the whole series was awesome but sad
Noooooo charmander😢😭😭😭😭
My question is: will Blue Shell Man Guy (in the form of Wartortle) meet up with Mewtwo? Because that was supposed to be Charmander's next stop after meeting up Squirtle. They could've actually taken care of this 10 years ago...too bad.
Is Charmander coming back? I really want him back please can you put him back?
i didn't expect this to come out i thought it would take 10 more years
Can you bring back charm after
Give Charmander a revive he’ll come back to life
I cant believe charmander died
can't wait for another year to watch ep 11
Wtf charmander died!?
It came finally!
Maybe the Pokémon gods will Bering back charmander
12:44 why is mewto there
Here's something I noticed, it may not be intentional but I think it's neat. At around 10:15 - 10:45, Squirtle refers to Chimchar as just 'Char'. Saying things like that he's rough around the edges but ultimately still cares about his friends.   The fact that Squirtle refers to them as Char makes me think that he isn't just talking about Chimchar, he's talking about his old friend Charmander too. Especially since what he said also applies to Charmander.
13:15 i just realized he's  wearing Charmander's head.....
To be honest the ending of this was worth the wait
I love this vid
Love it
Did you guys see that!? He just evolved into Wartortle!!
Omg wartole is now thw wise one si the leason is dont evolve your pokemon if you have unfinished bussness cuse if you evole you can never unfinished that ik def subbing cuse its emotional and wise and has really deep lore
This is different then 9-1
Me missing half the episodes and saying i know whats going on when the last episode i watched was 3 almost 2 years ago
well ... see you all on the next episode .. see you in a decade
life is good now
We need the return of Charmander
May i know if this is a made of Blender? Or Maya?
FINALLY Edit:THATS IT!?
Best animated series by far
I hate that caterpillar rip of. They killed Charmander. I would find an Op pokemon just to kill that caterpillar
Squirtle strangling the sparrow was the most wholesome thing I witnesses bc spearow pecking the blue turtle was just my pure anger
That was dope...
Took one year for a 30 minute video to come out 😂😭 i still love it tho keep up the good work 👏👍🏽
An so the birth of the GodSlayer was born
why did charmander have to die
Oof, not sure how they're gonna make up for the lack of Charmander and Bulbasaur. They were the best characters. But I'll stick around and see.
I hope Charmander comes back
I love this show
#TeamSeas
Squirtle’s face when he was with the worm guy 🤣
What does Chimchar go to the highest mountain in the world
While I do enjoy the way this episode develops the story, I already miss bulbasaur
And this... Is why you should pick Charmander over Squirtle
wait is this the last episode?
Squirtle is gonna ask the gods to bring back charmander
I’ve waited for this….bruh
Will squirtle later in the episodes meet celibi and go back in time to save charmander?
rip camandr
yo why did i take so long for you to upload this
Can’t you bring back Charmander and Bulbasaur by mewtoob
It’s finally here #theboys

Wartortle is gunna get the gods to resurrect charmander and they're going to have a good ol fight with missingno  (I hope lol)
Man, Charmander had the Potential for a great character arc, and now he's just dead.
#ReviveCharmander
Wait, what move did Squirtle use on Leonard? Was that even a move?
Yep I actually used to like this series, time wasted, you show mewtwo giving a meaningful speech to charmander, 2 years later this garbage guess diamond and pearl isn’t the only Pokémon disappointment this year
LETS GOOOOOOOO I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS
yesssssssssssss finally i was posted
Damn Charmander is actually dead lol.
I like that missingno is fighting mewtwo at 12:51
Bro that was good keep it going
Plz hire more people im not going to wait!!!!
Its out!
Wait that’s not char
YEY i loved that
They're charged are still alive
OMG YESSSSSSS ITS HEREEEE
It be cool if in episode 11 charmander comes back as a charizard with like a metal face becuase his skin was turned into a hat so he could be alive?
Holy shit they made a new one after I finished middle school
Like i now chamander die but can make him  on evooluied on a charmeleon?
It took a year to make this…. I LOVE IT 😂😂😂
Hey, i love the ep but, at all, is the poor
Never thought that I would ever see a new episode again i love the series’s big thumbs up
Two more episodes left until the whole series wraps up! Can’t wait for the last two!
Starte Squad is back!🤩
See you all in 2 years
I JUST REALIZED IT NOW ALL THE EPISODES WERE A STORY TOLD BY SQUIRTLE UP UNTIL THIS EPISODE
hes become kratos
shit escalated even more
Damn, I miss our boy charmander. Great episode man. Excited to see the conclusion.
So cool! But so sad 😭. I hope charmander get revived or come back in time to save charmander :’(
A story very much needed as it's so reflective of what's going on in the world today. Only if everyone would snap out of taking orders just like Squirtle / Wartortle.
i miss charmander mane
This is literally so sad that the old trio is gone ,but what about Bulbasaur what is he doing? Bulbasaur is my favorite character from the whole series.
k guys now 5 years waiting
its sad that charmander died and uhh bulbassaur got the best ending for him-
YO WTF I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THIS IS SO GOOD ON GOD
But what the guck happened to Charmander did they really kill him off
he said it would be 2 more episodes after this one i hope it wont take 2 years again
i have waited over 2 years now and finaly you have realised it thank you
Fuck finally took you long enough
Can I say I've never seen a more badass Wartortle or Squirtle put is making evolve into a Blastoise and make you go against Arceus Dialga and Palkia
I cant believe this launched and I didnt get a notification!
i like the dark story. it makes the whole series a lot more interesting
Where's bulbasour
No way....
13:38 Think we will see Whiskers again. My theory is that she has kill the Caterpie Leader, get the Moonstone (Caterpie say that he know that she is not ready for the stone) and evolves too Nidoqueen. Then she will revenge for Leonard because Squirtle  kill him. Remember what she say to Charmander in Episode 9. This Caterpies was her family and all die because of the Caterpie leader and Squirtle. You can see her hate in her eyes when she saw to Squirtle.
The voice of Snover reminds of me 'The Professor' from Power Trip +18 😂😂
LET'S GO I HAVE WAITED 2 YEARS FOR THIS!!!!! THE HYPE IS REAL!
I didn't expect Charmander to actually die (touches neck frightened from this), plus Caterpie is wearing his head Bulbasaur is who knows where, and Squirtle freaking evolved 😱. I wonder if he'll demand the gods to resurrect his friends. Also, this was worth the wait. 🤩
sick
I am not trying to be rude but when will the other 2 episodes come after a year or maybe after 2 years !!!!!!!!!!!!!????.?.???????
Bring back charmander please
22:21 and I was like shit just got real 😳🤨😋😮
I just want charmander... Wartortle's evolution as a character was amazing. Absolutely STUNNING.
Its finally here after years and i guess i will hv to watch the series from the start as its been long time since i last watched it.
i hate this where is the normal
I remember watching the first episode when i was younger it brings back a lot.
yesss they made more
I want charmander backk 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Look at 12:51 and slowly it down
Since his voice was originally grissly, It makes sense for his voice to get deeper. It's like he's a wise sayan of something.
Les go
Horray number 10
this yt series is worth to be in netflix
OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS HERE     Edit: Cool thing squirtle evolved! Worth the wait, hope to see ep. 11
OMG HE'S BACK HOLY SHIT!!11!!1!1!!
Please make more 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
OMGGG I HAVE SEEN THIS SERIES IN YEARS
What's a Beaver this is the pokemon universe
Why are fire Pokèmon always so hyped and stubborn? I guess that's why they call them hot heads.
To be fair, Chamander was unstable. He literally signed his own death warrant. Just when he was becoming Squirtle's friend too!
To be honest, I was expecting Mewtwo to teleport and kick that caterpie's ass into the Distortion World and save Charmander
Once squirtle, well wartortle gets on top of the mountain i hope he asks the gods to bring back bulbasaur and charmander or go back in time to fix his mistakes
Imagine at the end we see charmander as a ghost
I loved this since I was 6 please give squrtle a good ending he deserves it
What happend to charmeder
Unpopular opinion: why didn't Hollywood hire Shippiddge
So warturtle is vegeta? No wonder why mega abominsnow had no chance.
An evolution into Wartortle has never been so raw.
rip charmander.
OMG YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
WAIT NO THE LEGENDARY JOE BAMA SNOW
You kill char you are stupid
THE LEGENDARY OBAMA SNOW
I just looked back and saw starter squad episode 9 was realised 2 YEARS AGO and starter squad started 8 YEARS AGO!      Also does this mean episode 11 will come out in 3 to 4 more years
Lessss gooo
Thes séries will Be always incredible but i am sad for charmander
Time to wait another 2 years
Another cliffhanger
Well "killing" Charmander sure spiced things up, but I'm still waiting for the conclusion of the "I'll be waiting for you at CERULEAN CAVE" Mewtwo said to Charmander.  I suppose if "Blue Shell Man Guy" is going to meet the "gods" they'll do something Space-Tiime related and bring Charmander and Bulbasaur back.  Awesome vídeo, it was worth the wait
Did this just turn into Pokémon god of war?? Pretty cool
Starter squad episode 11
Welp abouther year or a few months to wait for the 11th episode
Im So Sad Charmander Actually Died😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
See yeah next year for episode 11!
Dude warturtle a badass look at those glowing eyes like almost God mode
YOOOOO!
Ep 12 I can’t wait
I appriceate your work but Please release the next episode in less than a year
WHY YOU MAKE CHARMANDER DIE AND WANT TO MAKE WARTORTLE REVIVE A STUPID CHIMCHAR WHO CAME FROM NOWHERE
Did Charmander die because you got rid off the voice actor?
2:32 SO LONG GAY BEAVER
FINALY !!!!!!!!!!
Charmander its definetely dead?
Why did they beat up the Bidoof though :c Chimchar deserves it for being fat
Omfg it finally came out
12:51 BOY ARE YOU POKIMON BLIND TO SEE THERES A GRETER DANGER OPON US
Charmander and Bulbasaur were my favorites
6:37, that Caterpie is just as..if not, even worst than Charmander.  7:57, demonstrated...yeah, right. You're no better than Charmander tbh, worm.  10:15, Turtwig is right tbh.  9:30, because...of all.....THE ICE!!  12:40, you live long enough to let others see you as the enemy, worm.  14:09, I know why you didn't. https://youtu.be/jDbGe9HPTwI?t=8  15:22, he warned ya, turtle man.  18:04, coulda told him this without beating him to death,man.  18:46,damn.  20:20, realized it, haven't ya?  22:20,oh shit.  23:54, XD  24:27, became the biggest badass in this show.
if charmander came back evolved by the gods to make him battle  wartortle
Well worth the wait!
Well i cant wait to see Wartortle Kratos in action
Finally ep 10
FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS
if he can tear a entire arm with a single pull what of his cannon they might destroy mountains or his mega what can he destroy as that mountain chains , continents , PLANETS?
This was such a good episode! Welp time to wait another year for the next episode
Guys I have a theory that the poke "god" is charmander who evolved into charizard. Think about it, maybe mewtwo saved charmander last second and took him to the top. Charmander thinking about his life and how it would be best to become powerful, resulting him turning into a god. I may just be in denial but it's a possibility. Anyways time to wait for another year...
1:06 your what descendents you die because of your actions
Perfect 😋
I can't believe u returned bro
"Pokémon don't die they faint"
Who was that band in the end?
Charmander will be ok I feel it
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally!!!!!!!! It's here!!!!!!!
FINALLY AFTER TWO DAMN YEARS Also WHY THE HELL DID YOU LET CHARMANDER DIE
I wonder what happened to bulbasaur
bro I can't believe they took the Charmander now it's going to be a little embarrassing ;-;
How is charmander a chimchar
Always loved wartortle!
Wow!
“Oh cool, what are ya gonna ask”    “Something.”
Morning = Made. Thank you!
Noo! I miss charmander!.
Yes
So just saying I went back and rewatched all the episodes when I seen this was dropped, and I gotta say this was all very well put together and we'll scripted, the voice actors did a fantastic job and the animation is in point, and the fact that it's an  original concept spinoff of Pokemon is even better, there's comedy, action, and serious points mixed all throughout the entire series, and the fact that rock types sing absolutely fantastic, this show got me fully wanting more, I love the characters and there development, also love the fact the Wartortle took the war park to heart lmao 🤣😂, I'm also very surprised a show like this could still make me go from..... Yeaaaaaaahhhhhh fuckin kill him, get that bitch, to weeping about the characters to laughter and back and all around, I'm really hoping for more after the final, and I'm really hoping to see Charmander come back changed and Wartortle getting the closure he needs to not be broken, but I gotta just also say yeah you go kick there asses Wartortle!!! Fucking epic ass glowing eyes and badthefuckass attitude, also love the music this show gets that 5 gold star ⭐ everyone wants so bad
at the year of 1000000000000000000, episode 11 will release and Shippiddge will envolve into a slowking! how cool is that???????????????????????
yea this definitely is the best episode yet
I've been here since 1, fuckin 8 years and we're only on 10. I can't really complain though since it's funny as hell.
Next ep only on 4021🤣
Now this is a masterpiece anyone else would have made charmander Op like anyone else but you chose squirtle which is both bold and unexpected
Bruh charmander had to die NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Subscribed. This is a masterpiece
Wow this was so good! Can’t wait for the next one😎😎😎
Charmanders death is too sad…. But wartortle is awesome!
Finally
I’ll always miss this series I’ve been watching since I was two
What happend to charmander body
It's came
Finally
i remember watching this series in elementary school.Im in 11th grade now :0
Wow this made a lot of unique turns that I didn't expect. I was so shocked and sad about Charmander and Bulbasaur.... I'm so excited about whatever comes next! Good job people!!!
Whoa whoa whoa , so charmader really die , then what happens to bulbasaur did he die to
Bruh idk if I like how it ended but Ye cool make the others nowww
God i almost forgot about this... im craving excitement!!!!
bullshit  I waited for so long  for this
It has been years waiting for your world best animation it's so entertaining and so insane you deserve more then 1million subs I think for your hard work it should be 50 million subs
Please tell  me Blastiose   is going to end up fighting Arceus. I know that shouldn’t be a fair fight but neither should Warturtle vs Abmasnow G max (I know it’s not a g max form just making light of it.Seriously though they should use this as a reference to what a giganta max Abmasnow would look like. lol. )
Omg finally!!!
Finally I waited 1 year for this
just a ideu cant you make charemander come back with a max revive
took alot of time until episode 10 got released (2 more episode to go)
this serie could be even better with rated R content and adult language
Why charamender died if can charamender learn doulbe team
Demnnn awesommeeeeee
now we wait more 2 years to the next ep
YESSS YESSS
IT’S BACK
This dude needs a staff to help pump these out more often.
my childhood series, finally episode 10!
I can't believe charmander died THIS SUCKES WITHOUT SEEING WORMS DIE!!!!!
This is Lit more episodes pleaseee!!
This is cool
This didn't stop showing up in my recommended no I am finally watching it I am surprised that there's a racist Pokemon in the beginning of the video.
Ah watching this after the oldest episode
I'm guessing episode 11 is gonna take about a year. Unless you have people helping you animating and if that's the case im guessing about 6 months.
bro why is tis so good
The next episode should be wartortle goin up talkin to whoever and evolving into blastoise somehow and when he is fighting whoever is up there and is about to lose his dead friends come down and help him like avengers endgame
The wait is over!
He's back from the dead
The fact that Charmander died in episode 9 got me fricked up
IT'S BACK
Now we wait for ep 11
Episode 11 plssssss!
LETS GO EP 10
2 more episodes left and this is really amazing
ALL MY LITTLE TREELINGS 🥲
when i first started watching this series what, 8 years ago? i never thought i’d eventually be theorising about the in’s and outs of squirtle’s trauma
I'm still hoping that charmander actually make a return but as a soul
What’s another 17 years…
Warturtle is going to find Diagla  Trust me          No you will trust me
sooo... Bulbasaur: became cow charmened: died to a caterpie squirtle: developed PTSD and evolved...   I feel like there's a movie with similar story line... but great job on this. amazing.
Charmander used Substitute and managed to make it to cerulean cave which is why Mewtwo was battling the creature and not waiting for him. While battling the creature charmander was transported to another dimension where he was found by the pokemon gods. Learning his place in the world he now servers at the top of Mt. Coronet as a Charizard the same as Abamasnow learning to obey commands and being tamed. All while getting stronger to defeat MissingNo. Now it will be a battle between Charizard and Blastoise who have swapped ideals. Then 1 or both of them will end up facing MissingNo at the end.
Holy Duck this Gettin Real
Finnly
Cant wait to see episode 11
nice finally
Imagine getting a heart from both
Noooooooo, this can't be the last episode !!!!!!
Loved it. Incredible episode
I fell like charmander is still alive
Ep 11
Cant be the only one seeing mewtwo fight a glitched hitmonchan or mewtwo
Holy shit wartortle got a deep voice.
Cant be the only one that didn’t realize the grass pokemon was turtirg yes I butchered that
Who plays snover it sounds so familiar?
OMG
The legend has returned
i think bulbsaur might take a revial stone and reviave charmander
what happend to bulbasur
Let squirtle find the revival stone
Bring Charmander back
your such a slowpoke
The return of the king
Can you not take 5 billion years
I miss charmander
I can’t wait until episode 11
I can’t believe Charmander actually died here, i was hoping to see him in this episode.
i wish charmander didn’t die and he was still friends with squirtle and they evolved together
When’s ep 11 coming?
This series is one of the greatest things on youtube seriously. I’d be so sad if it’d be copy-striked by nintendo.
Thw first ep was hilarious but here we are now, deeeeeym. Cant wait for the next ep
ok now we will have to wait 1 more year for next ep
Can't wait for 2023!!
"Oh Cool! What are you gonna ask?" "... SOMETHING". *Que Heavy-Metal*
Can’t wait for 11
can charmender be reveived by mewtwo
FINALLY MAN 🔥
next..its story verry cool..'im suport always for you..(episode 11)
RIP Charmander, you will always be remember in our Fire-type hearts
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
12:50 Mewtwo still fighting the abomination after all these years.
is wartotle is going to talk with the gods(dialga, palkia and giratina) to bring charmander back? also posting it before the release of the new remakes of gen 4 niceee
Kinda surprised at how many people wanted Charmander back... I mean... he kinda set all this in motion to begin with by becoming a raging serial killer after not getting picked at a lab... regularly bullied both Bulbasaur and Squirtle... not to mention unleashed MissingNo. onto the Pokemon world... Like he's a well-written character and everything but guys... with all the choices he made he was absolutely gonna die a brutal death eventually...
After 2 years the legend post again
YOOOO WE BACK!
I'm been waiting forever.This was totally worth the wait
Why you freking carterpe kill a charmender
the caterpie would win the war with less death is by evolving. For example metapod's are tank's and butter free are flying unit's
I am actually getting sad about Charmander died
I didn’t expecting charmader to die
Nice
SO COOL!
I bet the deity is Peanut Butter (Bidoof) from Pokemon Rusty. Epic Crossover incoming. :D
remember when the series started? who would have thought that it would come this far.
thank you for uploading this (I really appreciate that you are making a dedication and taking this massive burden)
Bro, this is awesome!
Finally is back
I have waited a year for charmander to die and now replaced by a rage monkey
17:11 I like it because he looks like a ping pong ball
Me like idk how long ago: WHEN WILL THE STORY CONTINUE me now: I'm happy 😀👍🏻
12:51 what is Mewtwo doing there
THE LEGEND'S BACK WAKE THE CHILDREN
And it only took almost two years to see the best thing ever again.
OMG I waited a hole year for this hold up 98 I- he was level 13 in ep 9 another year it is :D EDIT half way to another epsoide
Dude.. this is amazing work, thanks for that
Oh my God, they actually killed off who is debatably the main character.
I really like squirtle's new colour palette  But wartortle's voice is probably good for blastoise
I love this I think it’s better than 9 but I’m still bummed by how charmander died
HORAAY
team rocket blasting off again!!! 2:35
Love it
Although Charmander death is sad, I have to say, he totally deserved it for everything he did.
Can't believe this slip by my notifications. I love the character development of Squirtle. Charmander, Caterpie and Chimchar all had one thing in common. They let their anger and thirst for power cloud their judgment. Caterpie may have gotten his revenge on Charmander but he learned nothing from it.  Squirtle was the voice of reason but he kept choosing to follow. Then he ultimately became a mindless follower to Caterpie because he wanted stability but Caterpie was no better than Charmander. Squirtle finally realized that mindlessly following is always a recipe for disaster. Charmander got what was coming to him. Squirtle got his redemption. Such great writing.
I’m digging the God of War vibes. The crossover I didn’t know I needed but I’ll dream about it forevermore
So charmader died... I like it
The mega abamasnow part was like a god of war boss fight
Oh my lawd it's finally here
thought u guys died after releasing ep 9
Ive been wating for this!!!!
I thought he'd evolve into Blastoise
Omg finally!!!
So nobody going talk about carmanders death......
me looking every day at the channel for more eps me looking for over and year
the wait is finally over after 2 years of waiting...LETS GOOO
12:51 Hi, Mewtwo?
Whoa, my ears are bleeding magic.
I just hope that in 12 or 13 charmander comes back as a charizard and the head of him was actuly just a shell.
Awesome
While everyone focusing on Squirtle and idiot Carterpie story , I'm thinking about Mewtwo main quest .
NOOO I WANT EPISODE 11 NOW!!! 🤬🤬
YO HOLY SHIT THIS WAS BETTER THEN I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED WHAT THE FUCK
Finaly
absolutely incredible thank you for this series i think i speak for all of us when i say we can't express our gratitude and enthusiasm enough
Can you bring Charmander and Bulbasaur back in the mountain? Please 🥺
We need more smashtasm!!!
Charmander... No
mmmmmph~ I love the new story line. While the voice change maybe too ... dragonball, I think everything else is still pretty epic.
Can’t wait for episode 11 and 12.
Where’s Piplup in all of this?
You cant go that way! It runs through snow way! There is snow in the way. LOL i died.
me who started watching years ago, and seeing all the progress and how llong it took was amazing
need the evolution of this legend wartortle to a god blastoise
I WANT MORE MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This whole series just made me remember bojack horseman lore
And now we wait for the next episode  of OP turtle
Wait a minute did anyone saw Mewtwo i saw Mewtwo in this episode mewtwo came 1 second and disappeared shippiddge is Mewtwo going to become a important character in these episodes
"Bird sounds come out of me!" 😂😂😂
Shippiddge please make charmander return but I want him to evolve please
I have been waiting for 5 years for this,I am 12 btw
Mewtwo at 12:51
That episode was so good!
so uh ep 11 next year?
FINALLY GOSH
It feels weird that charmander isn’t there
Can i expect Lord Helix to appear in this series lol
I actually am sad on The death Of Charmender
Finally
I shat myself when i saw it on reccomended
More plz
when will you put episode 11
I have waited 2 long years for this
the wait was worth it to see chapter 10 congratulations is a good chapter
you know i think there in sino region
22:58
22:56
After the death of Charmander, I was unsure of how this animation was gonna shift in terms of quality. However, I just thought it got better. The character progression that Squirtle has gone threw has just made this series most enjoyable. Keep up the good work.
Finnaly yes he put MONKE in animation
Yay episode 10 is made and it super cool but it sad the Charizard died
Time to wait 3 more years!
YESS
Avatar: The last Squirtle
How has it been 2 years
WOAHHHHHHHHH ITS BEEN A LONG TIME
please bring the charmander back i only watched because of him but when i saw him die then i got sad so if you can bring him back
please come back charmander
i love squrtles voice its soooooo EPIC much more epic than charmander
This is sad ep😭🔫
Shell of war
The wait is over
It's Finally Here, 🥲🥲
“You just using us to relive your stupid childhood”  That hurts
charmander is seriously dead???!! nooooo he was my favorite 😭
FINNALY
Really good i feel bad for charmander though because charizard is my favorite pokemon. This episode is a mix of funny and sad my brothers who watch ur vids loved it!!!
😡 my boy charmanter
It needs a different ending
Finaly episode 10 i was waiting for a year im sad that charmanders dead
I did not like it no Charmander sad
Wartortle turned into an absolute god
Finally
CHARMANDER DIED?! NOOO
soooooooo when's episode 11 coming out?
The ending music is so epic.
Alr 2 more years till the 11th
Wow this episode was worth the wait
12:51 ! It's Mewtwo ! Fighting the  Glitch
tanto para esta mierda
Yeah 2 years of waiting
another year and a half till ep 11
After this, they still didnt meet Mewtwo in Cerulean Cave. Guess its Squitles problem now.
man i'm gonna miss charmander
this was honestly so depressing [SPOILERS AHEAD]               just having charmander being ACTUALLY DEAD is sad he was my favorite  and squirtle being basically a mindless slave is just horrible, and now he has to just deal with 2 LOSSES NOW it makes me so sad
I think Mr. Floating Guy (Mewtwo) are still waiting for Charmander to come in the cerulean cave. Sad that it will never be happen.
Is charmander coming back
Bro this is like Anime.
Squirtle sucks
YES EPISODE 10 IS FINALY OUT LETS GOOOOO
The Snovers are SO good.
did anybody notice mewtwo was still fighting that glitch
HAHAHA YES FINALLY
Yes my guy
NO WAY
I can't get over Squirtle's deadpan stare throughout the flashbacks.  He was truly defeated.
Something i noticed is in the last flash back of squirtle when caterpie frees him,caterpie doesnt have Charmander's Head, and connect that with How in the video "3 Episodes left" when bulbasaur asks Charmander what happened Next,he said "i dont remember" this could probably be a hint Charmander isnt actually dead, But out there somewhere,as well as bulbasaur could also be Alive,again i could be wrong and caterpie not having Charmander's Head in the last flash back an error,and they actually are dead,well find out in a couple years probably(also yes this was inspired in a comment a person made who i dont remember the name,rip)
Yes finally he releast it
GUTS I KNOW THE PLOT, Swuirtle will go up the mountain to find palkia and dialga, he will go back in time to try to save Charmander and maybe Bulbasaur
If all of your Roblox is wrong today ask me cuz my Roblox is not working too
Pokémon gotta catch em all Pokémon
EP 10 LETS GO
Can you bring charmander back the gods could revive him
yessir its back
where tf is charmanda
Let´s hope it doesn´t take literal years for another episode to come around
You earn a sub
Bring Charmander back
Damn I miss the old squad with bulbasaur charmander and squirtle
When’s 11 coming
YESSSSSS
Charmander died😱😱
Can’t wait for the next episode because this is a good series.

(Don't ask) 0:40 1:37 2:31 3:47 6:08 8:22   10:03
Man there was a life lesson learned in this and this is such a good series keep up the good work much love and support from your subscribers

Im waiting for this for too long
Yay I v been waiting for 2 year s
2:57 why Tirtwig is the best starter behind oshawott
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It would probably be so COOOOOOOOL if charmander came back from the dead
I almost cried when i saw thst charmander wss dead
when is next episode
Holy crap this is good
Squirtle becomes Kratos
Are you going to make an episode 11
Char...charmander...😔
- "oh cool what're you going to ask?"  - "...something"   this part made me laugh so much
Mewtwo is still dealing with the glitch lol.  12:50
It has happened……
Oh mah god
Seriously what happened to bulbasaur he left there because he got depressed by the death of his friend and followed the ground pokemon or he died when catterpie saw that he would take revenge give me an explanation shippiddge
All of this because charmander killed a caterpie
this entire episode is just the quote "Who decided that?"
:(
dont tell me another year!!!
when episode 11?
wait sso
I miss charmander :(
probably shouldn't have laughed when bluely killed lenard
what is it with youtube comedy series beginning with jokes and laughter and then slowly slip in to dark and serious drama? i just wanna have a good laugh with stupid jokes! is that so bad? NOT a critic...just a tgeneral thought
Can't wait for the nexst ep keep up the good work!!!!! 😃
I forgot what happens to charmander and bulbasaur plz tell me I forgot
ITS HERE
Stickle killed me lol
those one shots at the beginning were amazing
This is so dark and so sad, I feel sorry for Squirtle
This man is in the fire monkey version of "it's just a phase mom"
charmander is dead.....
Que le paso a charmander y a bolbasuor?
OMG FINALLYYYY
This thing started when I was 10 now I'm 18 this process broke me rn
This took so God damn long and I'm happy it's out now
Cool, 2 more years for the next one
NO CHARMANDER IS DEAD CMON MAN THATS NOT EVEN FAIR MANNN
bruh one year for this
wow he did it. he uploaded episode 10, my day is now made and my disappointment isnt immeasurable
he was a legend the lizard
22:13
I started crying when I saw charmanders head that messed me up I have been watching this since I was little thanks for the great memories can’t wait for the next episode
lol
But a Wartortle is not THAT powerful...
ITS FINALLY OUT WOOWRAIOJDNKW
FINALLY LES GOOO
The thumbnail looks like a Squirtle Pokémon card.
oh shit  i forgot this shit existed,
if only caterpie used his fucking geodude from episode 9 to fight the fly pokemons...
Noooo charmander
It’s been a year finally
Wow this looks epic
I KNEW I recognized Greg Hoffman's voice!  Love that dude.
CLOSE TO 10 YRS OF STARTER SQUAD BABY WHOOOO LESS GOO 2 MORE EPISODESS WHOOOOO 2 YEARS WE WAITED 2 FGODDAMN YEARS IM GONNA CRY
Better development than Eeveelution Squad
where is the charmander??,he died ?
Thank you guys see you again next year!
GIVE. THEM. HELL, WARTORTLE.
AT LAST we have number 10 let’s go
:"v
The beginning of the episode was a reference to episode 9 I think. Where the monkey is charmander and the beavers are the caterpies. And then the water reserve part is a reference to when squirtle started blasting charmander with water. This is my prediction.
Where tf is charmander
Charmander just- waiting up there, lol
THE LEGEND IS BACK!!!! HES BACK!!!!
all i can say is, FINALLY
i wonder about bulbasaur     either he's dead so either squirtle: a. was under control of caterpie and i'd love to see how that scene went down b.he died after which would be more boring     or he's alive
That ending is literally the definition of that meme "Man too angry to die"
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A NEW EPISODE!
im shook yall, like deadass. I hope mewtwo or these gods or whoever can be convinced to resurect charmander and maybe chimchar as well. char squared if you will
"You'll never make it through snow way."  "Why not?"  "There's snow in the way."  Genius
See u next year man
Finally after so much time... He returned.
Ok... I have 50/50, perfectly divided feelings on Shippiddge's choice to kill off Charmander... wait-.. No it added to the story x100,000.  *I nearly had a heart attack when I saw this in my recommendations*
Does anyone notice caterpie hat is charmander😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ok at this point, this is an anime now
Bro.... are we not gonna talk abt how spazkid was in this video
Starter squad : Pokémon of war
when tf u came back
Yes finally after 5 whole years
Please bring back charmander and bulbasaur it is not the starter SQUAD  with out them so please bring them back
I don't want this to end
Dang the starter squad series has changed from the beginning.
OMGGGG
YES!!!
Plot Twist: charmander didnt die but turned into charizard then killed a god
Anyone feel bad for whiskers?
ice beam the worm
Them saying Squirtle is level 98 is such big foreshadowing. it has just enough levels to evolve 2 more times. Yes it may have evolved into Wartortle but it can still evolve again. I wonder when we'll see the other Starter's evolutions too.
Poor charmander
I wish Charmander come back
charmander diying has quite literally made me not want to watch this series anymore
Wait so Charmander is just dead dead? Just like that? After a year of wait he straight up dies just like that? This story is just sad, might as well kill everyone
OMG it finaly out!  and damn this was good.  And it got dark.  Did not expect Charmander to really be killed.  Also oddly I really liked Loyalty Squertel.
finally.
I've been waiting 3 years for this!
Bulbasaur for episode 11?
The nostalgia from watching this series from EP. 1 to relive the plot! I can not wait for the next one!         This series is just a rollercoaster of emotion. I don't know how to feel anymore!
finally weve been waiting for years!!
Anyone else notice it’s 10 years later and they are only using Gen 4 Pokemon? When gen 4 was roughly 10 years after gen 1.
Charmader was my fav character :(
After one year he’s finally posted episode 10 thank you so much man
please do more starter squad videos also plz do x&y
i hope charmander comes back soon, he was a lowkey good pokemon that i can relate too
I heard time and space, and started chanting Palkia and Dialga in my head, with the occasional questioning arceus,
Is there gonna be a ep 11
Beacause in stronger than him
Chimchar is like my brother
This is amazing writing but part of me wanted that Caterpie to die? lol
I like how wortortle vs a god he just rips him arm of what a badass!
This serie is a masterpiece , it's even greater than thousand of Netflix's series   Much love from ALGERIA 🇩🇿
HE LIVES. cant wait for the next decade
Oh damn they actually killed off charmander
Wait is bulbasaur still alive kinda want him to comeback since charmanders dead
I wish I didn't read the comments before watching
Did Squirtle nickname the Chimchar Char because Charmander?
Imagine wartortle goes up there and there just a big venus-saur there
HES BACK HES BACK HES BACK HES BACK HES BACK!!!
Just wait until he's a Blastoise.
AND WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST  WHEN THE WORLD WAS AT IT'S LAST BREATH  WHEN THE WORLD WAS AT THE BRINK OF DYING   HE HE WHO WAS HIBERNATING HE WHO WAS GAINING POWER WITH EVERY PASSING MOMENT      *H E R E T U R N E D*
Bruh why is charmander dead he was my fav man screw the green beans yogurt thing-
LOL
I did not see the death of charmander to caterpie sad
My yt? Is kip2
I think the gods r gonna revive charmander I really hope so
Nice that was amazing
Caterpie leader: with squirtle  on my side I'm unstoppable!   *moments later*   Also Caterpie leader: *loses everything*
The ending was bassically just god of war
I was not expecting Charmander to actually die. Man that was a nice twist
I miss charmander
ngl the wartortle thing went like borushiki vs boro they both destroyed the big boys' arm and they also did a really big attack to return them to dust XD and it was an arial attack making it even simmillar XD
@Shippiddge when do you plan on rolling the last few episodes
Anybody notice mewtwo and and missingo fighting?
Please
Can u make episode 11 & 12
Man, that ending... the "something" just killed me. This is one of the most long lasting, good series I have watched in a while. The music is epic and this was definately worth the wait!
I wonder how you’re gonna put Mewtwo and that Unknown that has Hitmonchan and Haunter in the last 2 episodes… This episode was choice!
Finally ep 10 after years
Nooooooo charmander is dead
And last question let charmander evolve to chameleon
Yeees I've been waiting for this!!!
After 1 year
DUDE I WATCHED THE LAST PART SO LONG AGO I THOGUHT YOU DIED
Bruh can we talk about how squirtle yeeted that bidoof outta existence
Didn’t know this was a thing. I was recommended this vid, I am so glad I was. Now to go back to ep. 1
I loved it  But now I gotta wait another 2 years😭😭
This took such a differtent turn XD
I didn't notice the caterpies hat until it zoomed in on it. Now I'm just depressed.
5:25 Wise words from big bibby LOL
WOW I COULDNT BELIEVE IT!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!
Charmander would be proud of Squirtle if he was alive
Did Charmandor  see die for good
Please translate it in french pleaaaase
PLS BRING BACK CHARMANDER IN THE NEXT EPISODE PLS PLS BRING HIM BACK FROM THE DEAD
Lets go episode 10!
6:09 nah bro ur on crack
well i hope Charmander's doing fine
Every 5 minutes it's just squirtle having Vietnam flashbacks
One year was worth the wait for this episode
I'm glad ep 10 is finally here it's been a long road to make this but if I may ask where did we land on missingno and mewtwo?
IM F CRYING RN BRING BACK CHARMANDER
When’s the next episode
imagine the bidoof that got thrown by squirtle is the big bad boss at the top 💀
2:46 HHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
See you all next year
Lets goooo starter squads back
Where is this series going?! 😶
IT TOOK FOREVER BUT FINALLY ITS OUT YES IVE WAITED SO LONG
Will there be episode 11?
It’s BACK!
I LOVE this series. A shame you have to wait for it though. I think it could probably be released on TV or Netflix or something
This just got a whole lot darker and darker after episode 10 lol
MY THEORY ON WHAT IS ON TOP OF MOUNTAIN: I believe that Mewtwo has trapped Glitched Hitmonchan/Haunter on the top of mountain and made Abomasnow guardian so that other Pokemon can't get in the top of mountain to be glitched.  Mewtwo believes that death by Abomasnow for those who tried to get on top of mountain would be less painful than passing Abomasnow, reaching the top of mountain and merging with Glitched Hitmonchan/Haunter.   Wartortle is walking to a fate worse than death.
I cant wait for the next episode now. Got me hooked!
Alright I take back everything I said about this taking so long now keep up the great work! :D
Is there going to be a episode 11
Geodude uses rock smash Charmander has plot armor  Caterpie used poke Charmander fainted
It has been like… three years finally
Damn , Charmander is really dead , the 🐐 is gone
I LOVED IT, YOU NEVER DISSAPOINTED US, IT'S JUST PERFECT!!! 😍  I will wait whatever you need for master piece.
Finally
sandslash shouldn't have left charmander because if we really think about it, charmander is the reason he evolved.
Sigh gotta wait for next episode
squirtle is an ASSHOLE, Charmander went through a WHOLE DAMN ADVENTURE trying to SAVE HIM, yet he gets backstabbed. Amazing plot twist though shippiddge, I love your content!
I have reason to believe charmander or bulbasaur will still return somehow  mewtwo in episode 8 made it very important and clear to both of them to meet him in a cave  I don't think shippiddge would waste that important clue away, plus squirtle is unaware about the whole missingno situation
The legends are back
I didn't expect they would actually kill him off like that and make Squirtle the main guy here but I love the twist. Not to mention that little snippet of Mewtwo fighting someone else. Can't wait for the ending
Everyone gangsta till regice or articuno shows up
14:36 Okay that joke is really clever
That's it I'm sick of you making me wait how do you even stick with making a video for a year that is impossible
Its been so long scince the last starter squad video
Great work guys! I was so "Oh no" when I saw Charmander's head
ITS HERE! YAAAAAAY
Seeing charmander actually dead messed me up more than I expected...
Anybody Elise getting God of War vibes from the end
this is lit letss go cant wait for ep 11
I’m sad that Whiskers apparently died…I wish I knew how it happened 😞
Finally waiting for year
I whach u guys so long when I was younger and yet I didn't think u still did this stuff and I'm glad you still do I loved this vid very this stuff is very entertaining 😀
Love you guys!! Don’t be yo long with the next ep ok. 😟😟
I think Mew is gonna reset everything to the beginning in the last episode.
Yoooooooooooo let's go
2 years left to go
Omg drop the next one  straight 🔥
only 3 more years til the next episode
The best anime line I've heard iny life Snover:oh cool what are ya gonna ask. Wartortle:Something
When your stupidly op in gen 6
more
Okay after sulking for 5 days I’ve come to the conclusion that I do not accept charmanders and bulbasaurs death🤬
anyone else still wondering about missingno
God of war Pokemon version
Ah OK so after the Charmander and bulbasaur squritle was friends with. Charmander died and so will bulbasaur but squritle is now trying to find new friends in probably a S 2 eventually
HES BACK!!!
Nooo charmander died why
Finally after all these years a new episode came out
Is that "dawn somewhere" as the Bidoof???   Oh My GOd iT iS
Finally thank god you made another starter squad thank you
Finally a video
YOU ARE FINALLY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ur videos are very good not lieing
Damn this is way better than what we are getting in the DP remake.
Charmander needs to return some how, he was such a lovable character.
Better get 11 out quick all of us are curious lol love your content
I’d there ep 11??? Or another2-5 years wait??
Depression now exist within me
Nice, love it
This all started eight years ago and it all began with a choice between three, people leave two other starter pokemon behind but nobody ever wonders how far the starters you don’t pick go…they achieve more than you could ever know
Lets wait 10 More Years!
Finally
NOOOOOOOOO CHARMENDER WHYYY. BULBASAUR IS JUST GONE AND NOW WE HAVE POST DEPRESSED PTSD SQUIRTLE
Oh whens the next episode? Lol
ep 10: gets uploaded  Me after 10 years waiting for the two last episodes
Noo Charmander is die. I m so sad..
YES
Who else is scared of Squirtle
Only problem I have with this one, and it is the first throughout the whole series, is the fact you killed Charmander off screen after spending so much of your time on his character and getting people to see him as a "Him" and not an "It" Charmander deserved to have at the very least a simple on screen death.  We waited 2 years for this one to come out, riding on the red hot shoulders of the epic Musical bit on Ep.9.  Long time to wait to find out the front man died between episodes and not have an explanation as to how.
lmao the snovers are so funny
I have a theory that is that in the final second mewtwo stop time save charmander and place a decoy there and I hope is real.
Squirtle will never know that charmander cared for him
The tree guys 🤣
wtf
THE AMOUNT OF TIME I BEEN WAITING FIR DIS YESSS FJNNALY
AFTET 2 YEARS FINALLY
My guy where the fuck is charmander bruh don’t tell me he died
What about the glitch or missingo pokemon
Oh wow that was a really huge jump in the story this was honestly my fav one so far
Its just convenient that the Squirtle is level 98 and not level 100
Omg what a long fkin wait
Now we just wait another 20 years to get episode 11 and 12 :) but even if we actually had to wait for years this series is really worth it! It's amazing
hm I wonder what happened to Green Shell Man Guy
This cliffhanger was epic but do we have to wait another year to see the next ep?
thats it? no it can' t be the end
If  more episodes happen I feel like a good turning point would make squirtle honour charmanders wish to evolve, if that happens then it could make a good ending and could meet bulbasaur again making more episodes plus making clean endings for this season and maybe more seasons
we have to wait other year
I’m guessing that the gods are Areceos, Giritina, Palkia, and Dialga
when is going to be ep 11?
Did charmander actually die
Omg this is something that I have waited for a year
I have waited centuries. and it was all worth it.
Well Charmander had a good run and  wartortle looks like a badass in the avatar state
Amazing i wait episode 11.
Red monke is like a 6 year old
Come next episodes
It's been a while I've been waiting can't wait to see what's next
I've waited to long for this
It all started with a cube “Blender 2.9”
Music as Wartortle walks up the mountain……pls. I need that in my life
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally! I was not expecting this, keep up the brilliance ship, stay safe too man.
F*ck f*ckin f*ck now i have to wait another couple of years of the best youtube vids. U guys rocking it. I lovr it so much
I almost cried when i heard Charmander died 😭
Wait....I didn’t save my game
que paso con charmander y bulbasaur
Next on Shippiddge: "Starter Squad - Episode 11: God of War... tortle"
I bet it’s gonna take another 40 years to make episode 11
This was my childhood and I thought it was over
The snover voice is so familiar but I don't know what im thinking of
NOOOOO CHARMANDERRR
Good Job Shippidge 👍 Another Great Episode For An Already Great Series, Cant Wait For Episode 11 (Even If It Takes Some Time) You Deserve All The Subscribers, Likes And Everything Else You Have Achieved. I'm Very Excited To See What Other Great Pokémon Content You Bring To Us In The Future!
Bring back charmander pls when they go up to the mountain  they find a revive potion and use it to revive charmander
The chinese symbols on caterpie's head mean victory. Neat
Dope
Big Bibby is amazing
ep 11 ep 11 ep 11 ep 11
cat or pee
I wonder if Charmader will come back
Nooooooo  Charmander is dead 😭😭😭😭
See you in 2022
Two videos of this left. Welp… see y’all after I graduate!
FINLEY
I am afraid of what might happen in Hoenn. I hope my boi Mudkip will still be wholesome!
Is there gonna be a part 11 ?
When he evolved tho
Abomasnow's voice sound like Saruman
This is an Amazing series and I am so excited for the next episode
Omfg the voice actors 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is great
Squirtle has got some really serious PTSD!!
ice is nice lol
Nxt ep after 1 year 😂
God if Squirtle is this powerful as Warturtle, what would he be like as Blastoise?
Nobody asks what the hell Squirtle did to Piplup to replace him in the new starter squad. Also I imagine in the next episode that they are going to show that Nidorina-Whiskers tried to avenge leonard-caterpie.
Abomasnow was my favorite Pokémon, now he will be forever.
OH MY GOD FINALLY
I’m 40 now.well it was a long wait but what can I say
I always want more :(
Feeling sad for Charmander He was my favourite character in this series 😢 #RIP_CHARM
- Ah. shut up, Bulbasaur  - Excuse me?! What's my name?  I'm  really crying :(((
Well dang I'm happy and upset about this episode I really thought Charmander was going to live but on the other hand I loved this story that Squirtle/Wartortle went through.
I discovered and watched this entire series yesterday and so far I love how this many year long project has developed. I think how this story revolves around the pokemon and not their trainers and their inability to grasp their own nature is a very original take on this franchise. The fact that they are able to use pokeballs to enslave each other, and that they have conflicting feelings towards the turn taking in battle (because that's what the humans tell them to do), as well as some of them aspiring to live alongside the humans while others just want to stay away from them, makes their bonds feel a lot more human. What struck me was how Butterfree's incapability to use any of her captures to great effect, since she is not a human, ended up costing her her own life and the escape of Charmander. Though she, alongside many other Pokemon, could understand the mechanism of the pokeballs, she failed to train the pokemon properly because she probably didn't have any badges, as seen with Golem and Geodude.  I mourn the death of Charmander, I carry the burden that Squirtle has, and I kind of resent Bulbasaur's complete obliviousness to this world, who is still probably alive somewhere. Squirle never erased the memory of Charmander, to the point that he always called the much younger Chimchar, "Char". What we can all hope is that Blue Shell Man Guy can make piece with himself in his new form and find the strength to redeem Pokemanity. I don't expect him to be on the bad side of Mewtwo. I think the gods must be Palkia and Dialga or something like that. Maybe he will resuscitate Chimchar. Even though I started watching this series yesterday it really feels like an epic tale.
Yes
haha, really doesnt feel the same without charmander. please bring more episodes, this is so emmersing!
Wartortle going shaggy 100% mode agaisnt snow lol
Idea on what happens next:  On top of snow way is a place where legendary pokemon like Arceus Dialga and Palkia live. Wartortle learns of some kind of impending doom up here, but he is too weak to do anything about it alone. He returns back to Kanto to warn the last friends he has about what is going to happen. He learns that after Caterpie released Squirtle, it begged Nidorina to help it recover the forest at any cost. They reunite with Bulbasaur and Sandslash with the help of Mewtwo and they recover the forest. When Wartortle returns to see Venasaur and Nidoqueen he finds out he is the only one among them who still isn't fully evolved. Wartortle then learns he can go to Pokemon Tower to talk to the spirit of Charmander. Wartortle meets Charmander who is now a ghastly/haunter/gengar. Charmander immediately lashes out when he sees Wartortle about how he went to the ends of the Earth for him but he just watched him die. Wartortle takes it, and the two end up realizing why eachother acted the way he did. Wartortle is shocked to learn how much Charmander has grown to appreciate him, and Charmander realizes how his destructive actions turned Squirtle away. After the two make ammends, the impending doom becomes impending and they have to deal with it. Wartortle evolves into Blastoise in the final battle and sacrifices himself to save the day. After dealing with it everyone learns a lesson about respecting eachother and taking responsibility for your own actions and how people can change and everyone lives happily ever after. Blastoise and Charmander live happily in Pokemon Tower and Charmander is proud of how strong Blastoise has gotten.
Finally
The god he’s was talking is definitely the missing number
finally
FINALLY EPISODE 10 IS OUT YES
I saw bidoof 10/10
Now i hate caterpies!!!!CATIERPIES SHALL DIE!
Its back yes
Waiting for next
I remember the series! When... i was 7 i watched this!
ok, i totally didnt expect that charmander actually got killed. also, i would prefer shorter episodes more frequently to longer ones every couple of years xD
Squritle was the reason why charmander    Died then followed the Pokémon who killed him without question but all a sudden he mourns charmanders death? No offense but who ever wrote this either didn’t care about it making sense or doesn’t know how to write a story. I wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t care all that much after all it’s a fan made series about Pokémon
Quick question, why didn’t squirtle not evolve into its full evolution after removing the stone that prevents evolution?
Being able to grow up and become more "experienced" with squirtle while waiting for episode 10 is such an experience fjfjdbcuchdjduchd
Abomasnow:WHAT THE FU- 'Then vanish' Me be like: hehe meme time
See you after 2 years .  Bye
At 16:07 Snow says Arceus's Japanese pronunciation. Same Kanji and everything in the subtitles. Can't wait to see what's next.
So at 12:50 what is mewtwo fighting
Its great but still feel not right that its not Charmander doing all that god defying acts
So..... The next two episodes are wartortle(probably blastoise) defying pokemon gods.....    Cool, cool cool cool
Its been to long
I was surprised that charmander actually died. I gotta admit I was looking forward to seeing him grow mentally from a rebellious charmander to an overly aggressive charmilion to mentally stable charzard. Him looking back and saying "I wasn't strong then maybe I'm not strong now. But someday I hope to get there." But then again mewtwo and missing no. Are currently crash coursing through time and space. Maybe we will get a rewinding time loop bringing back charmander but I do like warturtal's progress as well
are not going to talk about mewtwo i the background trying to fix the mistake char made in like ep 4?
Imagine Charmander Before diyng could evolve and kill caterpie that would hae been cool  Whiskers kill that F*ckin worm together with his freaking sensation power  Edit:Didn´t expect another flash back so take that worm
amazing work. was worth the wait. But why did you kill charmander ? 😟
What year is it???
I waited way to long for this
FINALLY FICKING 3 YEARS
I thought this guy was dead! I’m glad to see he ain’t ‼️‼️
Will? Wartole evolve into blastoise in part 11
Nice it's finally here I've been waiting for a new episode for so long
Now we gotta wait 2 years for the next one
I was really sad 😢 that charmandr died
see y'all in 3 years
Took 8 years for squirtle to evolve
Why did they have to Kill Charmander 😭😭😭
So we’re not gonna talk about the fact that Pokémon turn into Gastly when they die? And Charmander is dead, so maybe he’ll turn into one?
sooo.... when next episode?
When i saw this i though to myself "two years too late" Now, after watching this masterpiece, i want some more
28 mins?! THIS IS AWESOME
Hes going to fight acreus!
What happened to charmender ???
14:11
Snover: What Are Ya goin to do now blue shell man? Wartortle: “something” Me: That’s the best line I’ve ever hear him say
2 more videos left to go
So much for character development, huh? -_-
Yessir
continue pls
Legends say the blue shell guy has big big cannons on his back and fight tree mackdonald nuggets the spicy nugget the burnet nugget and the nugget left in the fridge for a week
What happened to Piplup?
I can’t believe you’re back
He bout to fight goddamn arceus
Starter Squad Before: Funny adult comedy Starter Squad Now: The living incarnation of Berserk of War
12:50 soo what in the world is mewtwo fighting there?
I don't like the second evolve of squirtles voice
This is so good
FINALLY!!!!
After 1 year....
But Missingno...
CHAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRMAAAAAANDDDERRRRRR NOOOOOOOOO 😞
We’ve been watching this series for 8 years now!
When is the next one?
Why he sound like luffy...
Ahhh such an amazing episode dude :D, ok time to wait for the next episode
Masterpice but plz for the next episode dont wait 2 years
Finalyyyy
Waited for 2 years
Kill the caterpies
Love the new episode
21:27 my favorite part
I hope charmander comea back
Well darn! This was quite a blast to watch! I feel bad Charmander is gone but I know squirtle will do ANYTHING to get him back, even if it means sacrificing himself.
This episode was good but now wait 10 more  years for the next 11th episode it will come in 3031
FINALLY HOLY HELL
I wonder what will become of the MissingNo thing? Charmander was supposed to get Squirtle, then go to Cerulean Cave to meet Mewtwo so he could fix the MissingNo debacle.  Then, of course, Charmander was killed. We saw Mewtwo dealing with MissingNo in one of the flashbacks. So I wonder what will come of that?
Anyone know when next episode is
God bidoof
I have been waiting for ep 10  for years
I have been wait for this LETS GOOOO!!!!!!
I hate caterpie more than anyone squirtle is dumb I hope they bring Charmander
Let's agree to keep calling wartortle squirtle
Bro please make this seris next part
The long wait is over
your few year late
I’ve been waiting for so long Imma have to rewatch the whole starter squad again.
Damn Naruto in pokemon world lol :)
What happens to charmander
Where’s mewtwo
Charmander started and squirtle end it
Please take charmander back all wanted him
Starting the year long wait for episode 11. 😭
Charmander will be in heaven where the gods are and so will monferno
2
Bru Charmander can’t be dead.💀  I’m hoping da gods revive my bruda
I Loved This Episode I’m gonna miss charmander
Dude idk why I just cant accept that charmander is dead :(
Finally a new update
The amount of people here saying Charmander will/should be revived really illustrates the fact he never should've died in the first place.
Really didn't enjoy the move with Charmander.... For real
Why did Squirtle not fully evolve? Cos he's going to warturtle, not Blastoise, against the gawds!  Ok, ok, I'll see myself out
i haven't watch starter squad before but when i see this after like all 9 previous eps i have only one thing to say,this went dark a lot faster than i thought and also charmander death was the shockest death i ever seen since theres no catch,squirtle dont help him,making squirtle feels more sinful but damn great job shippiddge!
Please say that the gods died from the bidoof that squirtle flung at the beginning after it hit them at sufficiently high speeds
Bring back charmander pls
long time wait for you
Oh Boy Welcome to Blastoise MANIA!!!
Best line Wartortle: drops on the big tree god with his shell The big tree god: WHAT THE FU
Wow THIS IS GREAT! but plz make more vids
Is charmander dead
Now I get it why it's called a wartortle
did the walking flamethrower and the grass type I don't remember the name of having a fun time sitting in the lab for the rest of their lives?
This feels like a spinoff series moreso than a fluid continuation of the story. I feel like Charmander's death was just for shock value and nothing else. Why kill him before his arc was complete? That just invalidates all the growth he had up until that point. And why don't we get to see Squirtle's arc at all outside of flashbacks? It just feels like the story was skipped over and left unfinished, and now we're just moving on.
This is fantastic writing. Shifting the protagonist makes it feel so unpredictable. The fact that Charmander is gone for good means that nothing is protected by plot armor anymore. And thats how you keep everyone on their toes !!
Literal tears. Tears of nostalgia.
I really hoped charamander evolved
It been 2 years cant wait in 2023 for a new one
Theory Bulbasaur and Charmander will be revived by arcues and in the last episode all 3 will be fully evolved and take out the missing no. Monster
At laaaassttt!!!! The story has continue once more!!!
squirtel sais this is between you and me just like charmender
Yasssss
Finaly
This is fucking amazing
great work huge improvement in animation. keep it up.
WAIT I HAVE A THEORY WHAT IF THE GOD IS MEWTWO FROM EPISODE 8
Really hope charmeder comes back
PErfect like everytime
That's how you open this!? In the first ten minutes you drop it on us that Charmander is deadzo? Ouch. lol Seriously though, I can't wait for the next instalment.
Ooooohhhhh shiiiuiirt
To be honest, I'm surprised he didn't go straight to freaking blastoise didn't someone say he was level 90 something earlier on lol
What was it that Snow did so wrong breh
To be fair, arceus is found at level 80 and dialga and palkia are found at level 50 to 70. A level 99 wartortle would probably crush them.
you really know how to make a good show shippidge you should be proud of yourself
Please do episode 11
I would love to see snover high or drunk lol
is this the end no more videos?
Came back to see if there was a conclusion to the amusing adventures I’d watched years ago (when there were only 8 episodes). Not gonna lie, the sudden tone shift is kinda surreal. Actually feels like something out of a fever dream.
Where is charmender ?
Can’t wait another year for the next one
I can't believe charmander just died!!!
my childhood is back the wait is over the nostalgia us great  I love it ❤
Damn, that was awesome! Squirtle snapping then evolving into Wartortle but since Turtwig said he was level 98 technically he should have evolved into Blastoise as well, but that's just by game standard not Starter Squad standards! lol Also I noticed that during the Patreon listing in the credits there's someone with an Agumon sprite next to its name, that's awesome! Oh and also I love how Mewtwo is in what seems to be a never ending battle with MissingNo.
What move did he used at the end?
Petition for charmander to come back as gastly
Wow just realized 6:57 he's about to mature and finally stand up to Caterpie, but he gets scared and stops himself and thats when he loses himself and starts "following orders". He doesn't get out of that mentality till he sees Chimchar dead.
I love this
So is bulbasaur chillin?
And make them faster please
Can you please do 11
omg this literally jsut popped up on my twitter, i completely forgot i binged the first 9 episodes and we never saw the ending
Finally
Wait what? I thought this is supposed to be the last episode. And it just ended like this? Isn't Charmander important? He is supposed to go to Cerulean Cave and meet Mewtwo when everything was over. Why didn't Mewtwo telepathically see that he is about to die and teleport there to save him?
NOO WHY DID U KILL CHARMANDER NOOOOO HE WAS THE BEST CHARACTER😭😭😭
alas
after so so long..
This is good but it's sad that charmander died
amazing. truly just amazing
I hope squirtle has horrible karma due to his decision to not help charmander. If he doesnt feel remorse i will be even more harsh
Anyone remember when Shippiddge literally told us Charmander was dead in the "3 videos left" video announcement? Probably also why only Charmander and Bulbasaur were there. It would be the last we would see of them.
I.....it's back...... NOSTALGIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
When there a ep 11
It's a shame on what happened to charmander I really thought that he was going to evolve and kill all of those caterpie but now to my surprise Squirtle is the true main character keep up the good work! 🔥🔥
OH MA GAWD IT'S BACK!!
Good
Just one question how come the video is capped at 720p?
Mans went full Kratos mode. Voice and all. Can’t wait to see him kill his dad.
I was hoping Squirtle would stop the worms but no skip 10 years of stories and look now it’s worse than I expected I thought this was going to be good but nope it’s bad
0:58 "My actions will be immortalized in your history books, and my descendants will destroy those books!"  What a raw line
He is coming!!!!!!
Aight see you next year
Charmander better become Charmeleon
Man Charmader was my favorite Character but he dead
Such an original!
i love this and infernape is my favorite pokemon of all time
Finnaly this was so epic but it's sad
Wartortle went Kratos.
Dude its been 2 years since i watch your videos
Fa… finally
ohhhhh yeahhhh  squirtle evolved my favourite pokemon evolved he will wreck the gods ( if shipp wants )
I've bin waiting and now im gonna wait two more years
Final this time has come
This was amazing and I absolutely loved it.
Plot twist: Charmander is one of the Pokémon gods at the top of the mountain. lol
I thought I would die before I would see the end
Tbh this was an amazing story. I hope Warturtle finds happiness someday.
i like how mewtwo is still fighting the corruption when there's a war happening
Rip our boy Charmander. He didn't get to evolve but he will be remember. Squirtle will carry on the will fire.
hey everyone lets sit down and wait two more years for episode 11
Wow chimchar is annoying  But anyways nice vid.
I'm glad Squirtle is the star of the series now. He's the best starter of all time.
Got a theory , before u ignore me listen its worth it xd  I traduced what he said at 16:09 he says arceus , theres literally god there , probably palkia and dialga too (he makes a lot of enfasis in time and space) I bet charmander wont be dead for long , squirtle learned from this 10 years that charmander was actually hes friend , he went to the end for squirtle , this time was for squirtle to reflect that if he had the chance he would save charmander no matter what , we see this projected in chimchar , and now he also dont take orders any more , he woudnt listen to "stand down", too bad he learned this 10 years later , or would be bad if he wasnt going towards 3 pokemon that with no problem can turn back time(they have before) so thats my prediction , and I bet i got something
I hate Squitle
911 subs
Anyone saw what happened at 12:50?
Wait what??? Charmander is dead??? Wth bruh. I mean yeah he was kind of a dck but he was mostly right. Hopefully Bulbasaur is still alive and they reunite soon.
It’s finally here
Is Wartortle basically a Pokemon kratos?
finally I've been waiting for months
Damn, wasn’t expecting that Nice turn
Damn after many years we finally got ep 10. Thanks u so much bruh. My kids are gonna be happy and they're gonna love this.
YES​ ITS​ HERE
when he said god of space and time, I got a theory that dialga and palkia stopped time to save charmander from dying so he could live a better and simpler life
When the opponent lands a critical hit: 22:58
OMG FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LONG
It took you a year to finally post why man why😐
Anyone else missing charmander
Charmander, NOOOOOOOO! Heh. man, this got dark.    Cool. Beware the wraith of the WAR TURTLE.
Ur awesome
Charmander is dead? Noooooooooooooooo
R.I.P Charmander
Finally it’s done
theres more right? this looks like theirs gonna be a big journey
Wait he still makes these??
Finally
Sinnoh! The God's dialgia, palkia, and arceus. Time and space, I guess we're going back in time at some point
Bro I watched this when I I younger it’s finally out
I miss charmander
Plot twist: Charmander comes back because of a revive
This is all shades of fucked up
When he whent god mod tho-
God of War- …. Tortle
please make OST from music im suffering
but probolly won't happin but i can dream right
it be funny if charazarded returned
but why why did charmander have to die he was my fav
See you next year
Squirtle becomes God. Charmander: WHAT!?
Time to wait another year
Epic!
finallyyyyy it came out after about 2 years
Charmander noooooooooo
ok now another year for ep11?
Oh my god but 4 year and finishied
Hope arcues will make charmander live again,RIP charmander,hope you'll come back
how could you just kill off charmander like that 😭😭😭😭😭😡😡😡
on top is red
more pls
I’m A bIrD !!! TwEeT tWeEt!!! 6:09
I like those litle dudes
charmander was the funniest character, i'm so dissapointed
Two turtles?
The series began when I was 4 and now I’m going to be 13 soon. You are really taking your time with every episode, can’t wait until I’m 30 for episode 10.5 to come out.
No NOoo NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY CHARMANDER BETTER COMEBACK AS A GOST!!!
Please bring charmander back with that glitch in the system (punching guy) plzzz 😭  He was having character developmenttt
If this series ends with success could we see a new season?
YES ITS FINALLY HERE IM 4 DAYS LATE BUT ITS FINALLY TIME YESSS
Waited too long for this, I am still satisfied.
The 2 year wait was we worth it 👌
Is there going to be episode 11
Please evolve squatrle
Plz make ep.11 fast as possible
Can’t wait another six years for an episode. Someone fund these mf’s so they can grow a bigger team lol
"damn you beavers"
The nostalgia hit me when I realized the Bidoof sound like Larry the Cucumber.
finally. its been too long.
Please post more it feels like it has been over a year
Its finally over... it took years and years for this episode to finally come. And it is now here. Cemented in history.
so that means Charmander is dead?
What if charmander returns and beats up squirtle and says “Pokémon don’t die we faint”
Why do I think wartortle is strong as a mega blastoise?
Since this is the 4th gen I wonder if Squirtle tried doing the same with the previous gen starters who either ran away or died
"Arusi-usu, huh? Okay, I see what you did there.  Also, Squirtle apparently evolved into Kratos.
I’m pissed you killed charmanser
YEEEEEEEEES
Wtf did i come across
I think its mewtwo
Plz I miss bubasour and Charmander shippiddge plz bring them back some how in episode 11 plz make Caterpie come back to squirtal 🙏✌️🙏
I'M SO PUMPED FOR EP 11 EEEEEE
I hc that Whiskers ran away and became a Nidoqueen, the end
I don't like where you went with the story
squirtle just becomes heisenburg
Dude this animation is beautiful, nice job
:,) another episode we can’t have cliff hanger🥲
Yes yes ☺️ I was going to die
Welp time to wait another year again for this amazing series
If squirrel doesn’t do anything with the gods he can’t come back from this
What happened to piplup
Squirtle THE NEW ANIME.
See you all in 2 years for the next episode
e
It’s a shame that there is only 2 episodes remaining I would love for the show to go on for much longer
13:40 "the more you kill the easier it is to distance yourself" what. why is this suddenly undertale... I thought I had escaped but it was just a ruse....
Now another wait I don't think I can handle it
12:50 Jojo music😮😮😮
i hope charmander comes back, i mean maybe he deserved to lose to caterpie since charmander did start the war basically by killing that caterpie, but still as much as a douche he was he’s still a lovable character and i hope he’s not gone for good. also hope bulbasaur comes back theres still so many questions unanswered!
The adrenaline rush seeing a new episode is absolutely insane!
Hell yeah. Just perfect. He finally evolved and hes in the best region? Amazing
Chim-char meh, but charmander's Death broke my heart
22:16 was epic
They turned charmander into Rob Stark
TOOK LONG ENOUGH
They killed off the mc but I'm rly sad ab charmander dying hes been there for years but the show must go on
Squirtle evolved into Warortle about time cuz Caterpie did a lotta terrible things
Squirtle evolved into a Shonen protagonist, ready to take down the cursed Shinobi world
Big biggle is the the best character
remeber when this didn't have a plot...
This slowly started to stop becoming Pokémon, an started turning into a depressing stry
Well this took a long time
Let’s go squirtle
This is the best
This was simply amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait for the next video! :)
MY GUY IS BACK LETS GOOOOOOO
Ohhh I see what’s gonna happen, in the next episode they’re gonna climb spear pillar and find dialga and palkia, and probably giratina aswell, they’ll defeat giratina, and then dialga will take them back in time and wartortle will save charmander
I’ve been waiting for 365 days
Soo....charmander...really die? Like die die? For real? He actually...die?
Wtf
Snover's voice actor did the voice for stan beaker from powertrip.
But no disrespect good animation and I know you put a lot of effort into it
I waited almost 2years for this then charmander dies like bro
hes back
this is so good!
YAYA
my question is WHY did they caterpie specificly target charmander when they deal with their people being murdered all the time?
Don’t know if I want to keep watching charmander dead
FINNALYYYYYYY
I’m honestly glad their still keeping the parody aspect of this series, stuff like Fearow’s dialogue, stover, etc. Even in the huge shift in tone and stakes, the series at its heart was always still there.
12:51 I saw that
Nice
My prediction is Squirtle is going to find Celebi to go back in time to save Charamander
You killed Charmander you bastards
TWO YEARS TWO YEARS JUST FOR THIS BOIS GRAB YOUR TORCHES
Holy crap it took you long enough
RIP Charmander…
Get really to wait a couple of years for ep 11
Revive charmander plsssssssssssssss
Charmander NOOOO
FINALLYYYY
PART 11
I just realized caterpie was wearing charmander’s head 12:26
Damn did my boy charmander dirty. Slick upset but still a great episode and series.
I never forgot 12:44
If Charmander is really dead I don't want to watch any other episodes
Rip charmander
again
*IM A BIRD T W E E T T W E ET*
HES BACK
*ITS BEEN SO LONG*
Nope not me watching through episodes 1-9 again because I forgot what happened
It took too long at yet I'm still here.
Finally! Now we play the waiting game...
whats the point of watching without charmander
I hope some how charmander will come back
Best episode yet!!!
Next: electric mouse guy
Snow: WT-
Squirtle: *evolves*  Fans: "My lord, isn't this illegal?"  Shippiddge: "I will make it legal."
Worth the wait I cannot wait to see the growth of wartortle in the coming episodes 😱😱😱
Ep 11 here we come
i miss charmander ripping ppls heads off
It's not that it was bad, in fact it was really good. It's just that watching it only makes me more pissed off that now it's gonna be 3 fucking years until we get to see what happens next.
I feel like that something is charmander
No way no way no way, it’s back
FINALLY
Finally it’s been 2 years your back
Welp I guess new ep next year
That it not a cliff hanger
the snover voice was gold.
Word of warning, you are about to receive a lot of hate for really killing charmander
CHARMANDER was my favorite
Bring Charmander back pls
The gods aren't gonna be there. Too many master balls and too few legendary pokemon for Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina to still be on top of that mountain.
If anyone remembers Episode 8 Mewtwo said to charmander to find him lmao
L ep
Bro I thought something happened to you man, I was worried that you wouldn´t continue the series or something worse since you were gone for like 2 years , but I´m glad to finally know you made another part of it I really apreciate it 😎👍
2 years, it was worth it
Oh my god
FINAALLY
YEEEEEASSSSSSSS

Wait did char actually die ???
Will there be more episodes
Who said this dude gave his characters plot armor? He makes and kills em off as see fit.
FINALLY
Took 2 years
Dang that was good to bad we are going to have to wait a long time for another episode
Squirtle has ptsd
it's not good we need Charmander
Finally It's been a long time
One question shippiddge is charmander ever coming back like in ep 11 or 12
this was worth the wait
What is the other characters base off 👁👄👁
EP 11
i love how all fire types just act without thinking
Cant wait
Say what you want I'm still calling him Squirtle after 9 years.
Charmander ACTUALLY Died?!?! I hope they bring back Bulbasaur in the next episode that will probably be released in about 2-3 years
Mewtwo still through in hands in the background with missingno😂😂😂😭💀
What happened to Mewtwo and Misfigo?
he's gonna bring his friends back
I've been waiting years !!!!!😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩
I want more.
Caterpie pulled a joker
if this is how strong wartortle gets how strong is blastoise???
Finally your post today has been a long time😆
This story has become a masterpiece, the laughter, the fighting, the grief, there’s so much depth to the story. It’s unbelievable how good this is keep up the good work and see y’all in 2024 or something
can’t wait for the next episode to come out in 2 years
Daaaamn charmander was my boi how you gon kill him like that😭😭😭
poor bidoofs
Omg thank you soooo much for this. My boys and i enjoyed this!
CHARMANDER NOOOOOO, SAY HE ISN' T DEAD
FINALLY WOOHOO
Man, the bags under Squirtle's eyes though.....
I’d like to see a return to Charmder.. Maybe as a haunter to help wartortle 🤔🤔🤔
I like how Charmander started *ALL* of this by killing *ONE* Caterpie
PLEASE PLEASE, WE NEED THE NEXT EPISODE!!! 🥺🥺😭
it just doesnt feel the same without charmander and bulbasaur
When you guys planning to release part 11 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Now it's time to wait another year for the next episode......
Thi is so gooooood
*THE RETURN OF THE KING*
*t h a t   i s   s n o w .*
Nice, see y’all in a year.
A jump to sinnoh was absolutely the last thing i was expecting from this series
Why did it take so long? Why did it take a year
WHAT FINALLY
Lets goooo
Dialga is coming to save Charmander...
1:00 damn he aint playin
So squirtle became kratos... I like it.
I miss charmander I hope we get to see him again
I was the first comment let’s go
hell :)
Now we wait another 3 years for episode 11
OMG I MUST SPREAD THE BIRD SOUNDS OF BLUE-SHELL-MAN-GUY'S LEGEND! NO GODS NO MASTERS!
Bro the story got dark fast dog 👀
Bro, I realized I've been watching this series since I was in the 2 grade... I'm in grade 9 now...
Seeing Charmanders head messed me up emotionally more then it should've
Well we’re gonna wait for 2 years again
Oh, so this looks to be a pokemon version of God of War. Noice.
12:51 mewtwo fighting a glitch in the screen ik you made the glitch appear but i just wanna call it out its amazing
When's 11 coming out 2 years from now
Is there another one?
It’s gonna take them another year for the next episode
So…..level 99 now…..clutch because he can still become blastoise
Finally
That was totally a voice change
I assume this is basically the end, but I would've loved to see the continuation, personally not a huge fan.
The way the snovers speak, where was it from? It sounds familiar.
He is back baby
YASSSSS
NO WYA ITS HERE
It’s not starter Squad without charmander or bulbasaur
I can only imagine that by a future episode word will have spread to Twig about the last whereabouts of his uncle Turtle. Beyond that, well I hope the series continues. I enjoyed the brief moment of that one psychic type fighting a glitch
Omg it’s out
I blame the snow animation for the reason this took so long
I've been waiting and its finally here and its amazing
FINALLYYY
I miss them already....
I still think you should add rock smasher to spotify
Squirtle pulled an eren I guess 😔
rip charmander
Can't wait for the next episode in 2 years but as long as is thus good of quality I can wait
After all these years
YES HE IS HERE IS IS BACK THX U GOD THX U 🙏
Why did you have to kill charmander he was one of the only reasons I watched
THEY KILLED OFF CHARMANDER! honestly that was so unexpected and i was so shocked, i thought they where gonna stay and evolved together but holy carp Charmander is actually dead.
So depressing lol
new anime arc lookin good
Level 100 squirtle is waaaay to broken
I don't want to watch this anymore after I found out Charmandr died
FINALLYYYYY
Turtwig and squirtle are turtles. So in what way are they related.
Omg how do I help!
i understand the name WARtortle now
finally
10 years narativley and literally 😭
2 years later and mixed in alittle God of War III. Love it!
What if squirtle ends up going back in time because one of the pokemon gods reverses time to get rid of missingno
If there is gonna be some weird way to bring back charmander, That would make me satisfied. Liked the new episode nonetheless
This gives me heavy vibes of GoW
So is he now level 99 at 22:19 or still level 98
Make another one pls
Ah yes the wait has ended, now to wait another 2 years😃
Yes it came out
16:02 arceus?
500yo later ay guys look ep 11 just came out
wow nice episode :) can't wait to see the others
This whole series is practically my childhood
12:50 seems kinda weird
Mind blown.... Amazing job guys
Time to wait another hundred years for the next episode.
Alright so thats it for episode 10, il see you guys in 2 years
Its been a year to long
This is my favorite anime
Im mad that charmander died i thaught there would be a plotwist
ITS BEEN 2 YEARS WTF IN THE SPAN OF TIME I HAD A DAMN NEPHEW
If wartortles voice is that deep now? How deep is blastoise’s voice?
Thank you so much
I am not sure but I think that I found a small plot hole in the series. Remember near the end of episode 8, where Mewtwo told Charmander and Bulbasaur that after they save Squirtle, they would have to go to Cerulean cave?    However we all remember how episode 9 ended so....did Mewtwo he somehow learned about what happened later on or just waited for them till he gave up eventually?(ok that may not have happened but I'm just saying😅)     He was very specific about them going to the right cave. That's why I thought of it as something at least kind of important.    Though you can freely correct me if I'm wrong.
"I dont know why I was laughing so much at the beginning. That story just had a bunch of death and a very sad ending". Turtwig speaking on behalf of the fans! Just brilliant. Kudos to the work you guys have put into it! The attention to details and a great story is what makes this epic.
Wait but of hes gonna talk to the gods of time and space what if this is just a theory but what if he makes them bring char back
GO WARTORTLE!
que buena serie madre mia  no se ingles pero lo veo igual porque esta re buena mi loco sige asi bro
There is no way charmander is dead
This turned from pokemon to dark souls real quick.
Holy F.... never thought this day would come.
It finally happened
Imagine he asks the gods to bring back charmander
NO CHARMANDER NOOOOO
Notice how in the last flashback caterpie  is missing charmander’s head. Maybe it was intentional to show that squirrel believes charmander is dead because of his Ptsd
It’s finally here boys
bro i can't wait for next episode
Thank you thank you
did this just become god of war?
Wow, that’s was super cool from squirrel- I mean Wartortle for now, and what is he planned to do now, I wonder?
Ngl kinda don't want to watch anymore charmander was the whole reason i watched
Omg ep 10!
YES FINALLY WE WAITED FOR 2-3 YEARS
This video is the werst video ever
Ngl, pretty annoying that you just change everything because lack of voice actors
I'm sad about charmander
I really miss bulbasaur
Char… you will be missed… I didn’t think he would actually die, he was my favorite character in the series…
Charmander new birth as a chimchar
I know the charmander died but there was nothing he could do to return, like a ghost👻
SOMEONE PLEASE TRANSLATE WHAT THAT SAID ON CHARMANDERS DEAD HEAD
What are the songs in the credits? Can't get them out of my head!
Squirtle’s pstd or whatever he’s suffering from reminds me a lot of Jack’s sucidical and self loathing thoughts he had in season 5 of samurai Jack. I’m half expecting next episode having squirtle or his new form rather having a argument with his past self and his past self telling him to go Kill himself
POGGERS
Great job!
Squirtle is going to war
Oh wait i remember this series
Ooo finaly
Wow. I finally saw the end of this beautiful series. Thank you.
SQUIRTLE legit went from my favourite character to my Most hated character
This is better than most pokémon movie
Well this was unexpected, nice work
Watching this reminds me of a scene in black and white where Alder criticizes Ghetsis for saying humans enslave pokemon. Stating that pokeballs do not enforce a will or trap pokemon and they could leave at any time.  Squirtle was as much responsible for the carnage as caterpie and it took understanding that to finally grow.
Did Squirtle just kick off Pokemon God of War?
Time to wait another fucking year for episode 11 🙃
When squirtle torture?
:O
Oh god I can’t wait
I miss Charmander and Bulbasar...
That outro theme though(when the credits roll) anyone know what it is?
In episode 8 they said if you die you change in one of these ghosts so Charmander is now one of these ghosts maybe Squirtle is going to find a way to make the ghost back to Charmander
Dayyum i waited this thing whole my life more than marvel novies
God I can’t wait for the last 2 episodes
this is so epic
What about bulbasaur
15:15  My heart skipped a beat
make a nother one
This needs more likes
Where’s bulbasaur and where charmender
Man I love how cool this makes some lame Pokémon . Like who tf cares about about Caterpie, Geodude or Abomasnow? But god damn this series gave them some awesome character!
Boss : I believe in you ! Me : 6:38
I knew you didn't stop making these! Glad to see episode 10 is finnaly here, im gonna enjoy this.
I’m so happy that you are still making these episodes. The amount of work you put into this is phenomenal. Can’t wait till the next episode!
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEW STARTER SQUAD EPISODE!!!!!! (Can't wait for next year, guys!) Also, 6:09 Did that bastard take the clip down? Yo, Shipp... You didn't report him, it's still up, man...
Not gonna lie, I thought squirtle was going to say more when caterpie released squirtle saying like "After all you put me through watching my friend be killed and worn as a hat and killing innocent Pokémon and you want advice from me. Well here's my advice, go and die in a ditch"
DAYUM!
I'm really happy I get to live until the release of episode 10. This is phenomenal!
❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
You know, when the Snover started following them I was like "oh god, no". But by the end I loved them. :)
It's about fuckin time that a episode show up
omgggggggggg
HOW DARE YOU KILL OFF CHARMANDER . (joking you clearly will find a way to bring him back)
The quality in these episodes is insane! Thank you!
where is carmander
Can’t wait for ep11
Finnaly this was worth waiting a year
oh this wasnt released too long ago...but i have something to  say GO TEAM SSUIRTLE! Also if you  guys have the time  what happened to balbasaur really
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HAVE TO KILL CHARMANDER but i do love GOD squirtel
Noice.
Prediction: After Wartortle messes up the gods, he goes to lavender tower where he mets mewtwo
did charmander die?!
and only 2 episodes left
Wait this exists 😳😔💀
dang the series is back
Love it, worth the waiting
*me realising charmander is actually dead* HOLY FUCKING SHIT
Holy crap this actually got a finale?  Or is this a full on revival?
This was my childhood when i was 4
Finally... I can rest
Wait Holdup When Epi 11 Gonna..be release..?
After 2 years of waiting we finally got it
Wow... This series got dark really fast.
Oh my god no way
Ho!ly!shit! This was awesome
Will it take another year to make another one
THE LEGENDARY MOVIE HAS CONTINUED
Squirtle is a madman.
NO WAY!!!!!!!
Can't wait for another one ! Seriously the best fan based parody till date
Wait Mewtwo?!!
took ya long enogh
You do this series once every 1 Year!
WHAT SQUIRTLE EVOLVED NOT CHARMANDER? CMON MAN
Congrats
To think that the first episode of starter squad was 8 years ago.
Is this Real? Finaly After 2 or 1 Year =D me gib sub and like
Finally
I like how this episode gives greater meaning to the personality quirks of Charmander and Squirtle throughout the series, Charmander represented choice and free will in the series and even states to Catterpie that trainers and pokemon should stand next to each other, whereas Squirtle has represented freedom of consequence such as wanting to follow some sort of code of battle because he feels like he just should even when his friends are being beaten up and proven even further here where we see his willingness to listen to Catterpie's messed up orders, him snapping at the end was him finally accepting the consequences of his actions, it's why he gets mad at Snow for trying to hoist Chimchar's death on the gods.
Ep 11 will come out next year ?
Much love and greatly appreciat it!!!!!
Finally!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for years!!!!! I watched this when I was 6, now I'm 13     Wait, I can't believe it. Charmander actually died!
yeah no.
I find it hilarious that this war was supposedly happening between a bunch of early game bugs and birds probably somewhere in viridian forest
My childhood has came back to haunt me
How long...Did this shit take...
OmG totally forgot about this, so worth the wait
Squirtle has gone through a LOT, this has definitely been another great episode in the series! Keep up the great work! I'll keep up with watching it till it ends, it's so amazing!
2 years. I waited 2 years
Ship, you are a legend. Can't wait to see how this plays out!!!!
LEgendary
ITS SO AWESOME I WANT 11 NOW BUT ANIMATION BREAKS TIME so I’m not rushing
WHO THE F*** DIS LIKED THE BEST SERIES ON YOUTUBE
Turtwig never watched Naruto lol
I want a squirtle now
Do Ep 11
See yall in another yr when am 13
See y'all in 2024
The Kratos vibe. I get it. "WAR"tortle lmao
bruh can someone timestamp charmander's death?
FINALLY...AFTER ALL THESE YEARS T-T
omg omg omg
Wow 2 years from ep9 to ep10 hope we don't have to wait another 2 years for ep 11 lol
Thissss is bad, horrible left turn from a good story you had going on
Rest in piece Char..
Song at 24:22 anyone? Me needz it
Part 11 coming december 22nd 2222
finally...
22:58 Best Last Words ever.
Really wish I didn't bother watching this because knowing that charmander is dead is kinda fucking me up lol  Please revive him by the end of the series idc how contrived it is :')
make a episode 11
Great show, but I’m disappointed about bulbasuars disappearance. He was my favorite character.
I WAITED FOR SO LONG
holy horse balls it's back
RIP charmander😭
Amazing
holy crap, after so many years of waiting it’s finally here
Yes finally
Charmander dying was literally the most disappointing result of the last episode I can feasibly imagine.
Imma say this but Charmander isn’t dead. He’s one of the main character. I think Missingno is going to mess up the word and turn back time or something. Future Squirtle telling past Squirtle not to kill Charmander and rebel against Caterpie. But the next episode might be about Warturtle getting revenge and perhaps reviving Chimchar. It can also be about a full episode of Bulbasaur. Or everything what we’re seeing is all in Bulbasaur’s head when no one picked him lol.
I hope bulbasure is doing okay seeing how caterpee's war ended horribly.
OMG YESS
Its finally here the after a long time of waiting its finally here
I love wartortles new deep voice it’s so sick
This man does not even have 1 mil subs he deserves way more
welp. See ya in 2 years
Oh this is still a thing? neat.
I cant Believe that charmander actually died
Was the 2 years was worth it perhaps
HE FINALE DID IT but I am late
Idk what i just watched but I loved and respected it
Best 28 minutes of my life!!! 😁
I know this is selfish but I want the next one to come out soon
I’m just sad for that spearton tbh lol
22:00 "then you have chosn death"  Remember squirtle is a level 98 pokemon
First the tree pokemon aren't as annoying I though it be which took me 2nd watch to see there 3  of them, the voice for snow monster did great and last evolving scene is awesome
I love this
So he will meet Arceus or something?
We traded a amazing lizard for a monke...Worth or not worth?
The wait is finally over
YES!!!!!!!!!!
BEST EPISODE EVERRRR
Woooooooooo I'm excited!!
i can't wait that was so good
What's the song at 24:39 ?
When is episode 11
Do people remember when charmander broke hitmonchans pokeball then hitmonchan was brought to the top of a snowy mountain and saw missingno there thats the same tallest mountain in the world so one of the gods is missingno the mountain god mentions god as in gods so theres more than one arceus might be the other and how is there 2 gods on the mountain when in the video it shows mewtwo fighting missingchan so it dosent makes sense how could there be 2 gods on the mountain when missingchans not on it does that mean theres a 3 god.
Bruh now I have to wait for ep 11
YESSSSSS WOO
What happened to turtwig
Me who almost forgot this existed
this is so much better than a stupid 10 year old kid trying to be the very best and catch them all... lolzz
You know someone’s dead if they have X over their eyes
oh wow what is this?? God of war????
Th legend is bak
This took 2-years apparently
intresting title
wow good ep basically 2 ep of starter squad because its 20 mins now all we have to do is wait 2 years for the next two ep totally no problem at all :/
ITS FINALLY BACK! ^^
A level 98 Body Slam? Very Effective.
FINALLLLYYYYYYY
Time to wait another year
This is probably a big stress,but pls pls pls produce these quicker,I love them!

22:57
So good but sorry for chicharm

It worth the wait ! 💯❤
Where exactly is Bulbasaur?
No fucking way letssss goooo
Hey you think Bulbasaur or Squirtle will go to Cerulean Cave to find mewtwo? Since chamanders yknow dead
What if Charmander is up there
I hope you guys make more episodes. I love the series. Great job
No on a clif hanger when ep11
that one brown thing squirtle fought in his first flashback (I think it was like a pig or something) is the most brilliant bit part ever, except for tree
I have to tell my grandpa Ep.10 updated.
Damn! That was some cinema quality shit right there!  Please keep this story going.
Man just turned into a super sayain whoa 🤯 shhiettt let do this come on !!! Give them war  Wartortle.  It would be cool if he’s got an axe 🪓
So  I’m Guessing charmander is right
Yay part 10
Do y’all actually think charmander died? I don’t think so I think squirtle will ask the gods to revive charmander and chimchar and make them fully evolved then squirtle himself full evolves and  they will have an epic fight (in ep 13) that’s what I think will happend I don’t know who to guess the fight will be against maybe that toxic caterpie that will evolve into a beedrill. This is just my prediction
finally
The first time actually having spine chills because of a video.. masterpiece.
Took yall a year? This EP must be great
This turned darker than expected, I miss charmander and bulbasur now. Can twait for the next episode.
Why do I feel like he’s gonna ask to have charmander back
What a shame on a ep 10
turtwig: what about Bulbasaur? squirtle: oh, he didn't wanna leave. i think he got the happiest ending out of all of us.\  ok so is bulbasaur still alive? the leader caterpie in ep 4 said they would use his bulb for generations, generations could mean either pokemon generations or 100's of years, definitely not the latter, and we never actually see him in a flashback or anything so for all we know he's either stuck in the burrow in viridian forest (i think? idk i'll edit it later if i'm wrong) and possibly dead,  or he's fighting missingno stuff with mewtwo, or he's just chilling with the pokegods! hopefully the last one, but we just don't know! thank you
When is EP 11 coming out?
Finally..
This feels like a major departure. It was good, but idk I feel like it's a wrong turn.
So are all fire starters in this universe just egotistical aholes? Also Wartortle got one lv left to evolve to Blastoise before being maxed out
ITS BEEN 3,000 YEARS  LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Oh my, Char is really death
it's kinda like the original one chimchar dies turtwig probably have the best ending and wartortle go on with his own journey
Omg thank you! Been waiting on this for a while.
why is char a monkey? Edit:nevermind i guess? I am confused
When will 11 be out
as of typing this comment this video is 4 days old Remember i was heree
pls do more
Squirtle evolved in wartortle Wartortle evolved in Kratos
That got dark real quick
I predict he will bring either chimchar or charmander back to life  just a gut feeling
Espere MUCHOS AÑOS por esto, ha mejorado bastante, de pocos minutos con poca calidad a esto, es increíble todo esto, buena historia, tristezas, olvido del pasado, F por charmander, bigotes ;-;
FINALLY
MORREEEEEEEE MOREEEEEEEEEEEE EVOLVE TO A FAST UPLEDER MAN IM NOT GOOD AT TYPING SHHAHDJGDYS
Dang, Charmander really is dead
still watching upto the credits... trying to see if there's more.. can't wait for the next episode... keep up the good work...
Oh this is great! Morbid, but great! Can`t wait till 2023 to see the next chapter!
Is the missingno the top God in the volcano.

IT FINALLY CAME
Thank you for this new episode

Honestly hate the way this is going so far I wanted to see charmander evolve
Finaly
Your graphics skills have definitely evolved! Good to see your work again after these years!

Holy crap it’s finally here! I have to watch this when I get home, if I forget remind me in 7 hours
It’s That charmadr head
Yes finally
Huhuhuhu lets wait another 3 yrs for the next episode huhuhu 😭
Perfection
FINALLY IT'S OUT!
Nice! Can’t wait for episode 11 in 2024!
FINALLY
Holy crap dude it’s been 8 years and you haven’t finished this series
Now worturtle is verypowerfull
Charmander should've never wasted his life trying to save a backstabber like squirtle
Like I’ve been saying for years, squirte is the best starter
after *MANY YEARS* its out!
Oh my god chimchar is britain
LETS FUCKING GOOO!!!!
Dang good to see tou back :)
This was soo good I was waiting for a whole year
Holy smokes this was a rollercoaster of emotions. I'm confused
All of those bidoof are female
When episode 11
finally  after the long wait, but I had to watch the other 9 ep to remember what story again
the plot and character development in this show is the best i have ever seen
13:35 it takes some real stuff to make me cry lenord was so young
Was the wait Worth it (yes)
I WANT A SEASON 2
This is the most in depth Pokémon story I’ve ever seen since movieunleashers. You are a amazing creator with a beautiful talent
It's been 69 years since the last post
so what exactly happened to charmander?
Starter squad the mountain arc
YOOO THAT ABOMASNOW IS LOOK LIKE FROM A CREEPYPASTA.  SO COOL
ngl the evolution was cool
I hate caterpie i miss charmander
Finally! After 2 years! Even your animation changed, noice! 👍
i have the impulse to download any roms with caterpie encounters just for the sake of massacring them ... fire red is a good option
Its finaly here
dang all the good episodes are being release at the same time, we all waited around 6 years for episode 10, same goes for lucas the spider, if you know that one lmao
Awesome
The fact charmander is dead makes me depressed
We’ve come a long way😭
What took you so long to upload this episode? Why do you keep taking long gaps in between episodes?
Imagine charmander is a ghost so warturtle can say sorry for letting charmander die
Damm. thish caterpie evil than team rocket
And then he hit puberty :>
So wartortle is just a SSJ squirtle. Cool
Where is Charmander and Bulbasaur
My heart broke when I heard Charmander died
Ifve love this series for 5 years and its still amazing abnd hilarious.
Where is The Sandslash
I was shocked to see that Charmander died, and I adore the lil nuance of Squirtle calling Chimchar "Char" because he's still mourning for his lost friend. Absolutely can't wait to see Wartortle mess up those Gods!
The Snovers replacing each other was so subtle i didn't even notice it the first time. nice job.
Rip charmander
2:14 I know I’ve seen this somewhere before...
holy ive been waiting for 2 years(?) well of course you deserved a rest
i think charmander is gonna get revived bc come on man if charmander is gonna die he would be killed in episode 3 or 4 not an entire 9 episodes
Wait, this still exists? I'M SO GOD DANM HAPPY
Squirtle is worst due to him charmander died😡😡😡😡😡 Charmander should come back
I can’t say it’s worth the wait because it’s not but I guess it’s ok
Well judging by the comments I guess I'm the only person who doesn't like this. It used to be a goofy funny Pokemon parody now it's badly written god of war reskined in Pokem on. The animation it all great but i just dont feel like the story fits other then the flash back scenes. Oh well hopfuly eps 11 and 12 will have better plots
Squirtle vs shaggy
It's been 2 whole years since i've layed eyes on this series after the 9th episode. I'm also older and more experienced just like squirtle, and I look forward to the series being finished.
Finally
Im confuse evolve to Blastoise
This show got really dark...er darker real quick.
Alternate Plot Twist: NONE of them got chosen, and Red picks Pikachu.
Big Bibby seems like my spirit animal.... erm, pokémon.
How did u dare kill charmander
This is really cool but, this just created more unanswered questions. Like it was left on such a huge cliff hanger, I guess I expected more from what happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur....Its cool that Squirtle evolved but I was a little let down.
THis Should be called Starter Squad V2
Hiiii
Still hunting down the caterpie with my arceus my groudon my kyogre my rayquaza and giratina
Wait what happened to bulbasaur?
Na well done fam I love this please continue
No doubt, this is Breaking Bad in Pokémon World
They gonna revive Chimchar guys NOT charmander.
Thank God this popped up in my recommended
Why is this soooo much better than any season of the anime? It's funnier, has a better story, has better characters, and just better writing. It's amazing what fans can do. This is truly a cinematic production. A shame there's only 2 episodes left, but I'm glad it will end with a proper finale.
Can’t wait for episode 11!
Why is this actually so funny 😭😭😂
oh god, poor Charmander...              he probably deserved it tbh.
HE DID IT HE FINNALLY DID IT 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
2 more episodes left...
0:58 I can almost hear TechnoBlade say "Bruh".
How the hell has nidorino not evolved in 10 years
🔥🔥🙌👏
Nooooo charmander died 😭 charmander is Hero
finnaly after 2 years
Finally our man has returned
i will pay u $50 to continue until episode 20
He really made charmander’s head into to a damn SnapBack. I’m crying laughing. 😂😭
everyone’s so sad about charmander dying- meanwhile i’m devastated that whiskers is not only dead, but it happened off-screen. homegirl got done dirty 😔
Let's fucking go, best pokemon series on yt
To be fair I think Charmander deserved that death.Caterpie did exactly what he did to the other caterpie. I don’t feel bad at all. Cool hat the caterpie has on tho.
I would say that they lost the war when a band of cartepie decided to fight a certain firebird apparently.
Who’s ready to wait another 4 years for the sequel?
That was soo cool! And full emotion! -welp see you again in a few years from now-
7:56 :'0
23:37 when he said pokemon gods it sounded so cool
I've waited for 2 years to find out... Charmander died and the worst part is that he didnt even get to explain to Squirtle why he actually infiltrated the Caterpie Cave... It was because of Friendship 😭
I was seriously expecting wartotle to evolve further into blastoise during the second "deadly" hit he took...
The wait is worth it
But, but, charmander 😔
Yeeeeeeess
I can't believe the Sinnoh starters came. It was my favorite region. THEN AGAIN, I hated the fact Charmander died, since he was basically like a main character. They did a character focus on him for 9 episodes. Which is why I always pick Weedles over Caterpies. Well, even if it takes years for episode 11, I will be always there. BTW, Turtwig is my favorite Pokémon. That's why I like Sinnoh.
Yaaaaay
This is actually goated 💯 Squirtle really changed bruh 😂
they keep doing mistakes
Ep 10 was sad and amazing but maybe next episode another year
12:52. What is mewtwo battling? Any ideas?
This was... wow. utterly amazing. i cant believe the quality this show has gotten to
How what a coincidence that this is episode takes place in the same region with the gods of space and time and one god has the ability to go back in time
2 yrs of waiting finally paid off
omg you guys actually posted
Starter squad let's go!!!!!!!!!
Another year to go
1 million more episodes!!!
So lord is fire types just want kill everyone?
Yesssssss goooooooooo
Your the man, guy!
Cant imagine what will happen to wartortles voice when he evolves into blastoise
I just finished watching all 10 episode and just realized ill have to wait like 2 more years to complete the series 😭😭😭
Seeing a level 98 squirtle with an everstone is truly painful, come on man, if you level up one more time you wont be able to evolve fully, ever. What a great way to show how silly he is xD
If only Red had just chosen Charmander or bulbasaur as his starter
8:00 NOOOOOOOOO
OH MY GOD
how the fuk is this soo deep?
Nice
I was waiting for this in a year i was so happy you posted it already
Started as a joke and ended as an bad ass anime
15:14 i'll admit, that made me jump a little
Snow way is telling you to get an HM
Now just another year or 2... But these are realy great and hard to make
8 years...
I never appreciated navy blue colour of wartortle ...but now ....yes
The 1 time I wanted a character to have plot armor. xd
Wait am i dreaming?
22:59 made me laughed so hard
Bring charmander back what the hell, make mewtwo bring him back he has to defeat that glitch remember
can't wait for the next episode in 3 years!!!!
B-but what happened to charmender
why is it that Chimchar really gave Technoblade vibes when he mentioned anarchy lmao
De fack
Time to wait 2 more years
holy moly it came out
FINALY I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS
16:07
2 years for this
Hoop
Did anyone feel a God of war boss fight vibes from that Abomasnow? And Charmander is actually dead! 🥺 He was my favourite
The snow guardian sounds like the sky landers narrator. All I can think of when I hear his voice is “skylanders of the fire element are stronger in this zone”
22:17 God of Wartortle
In the next episode
My friend said this world is war and death
I hope the 11Th episode is faster created
Missed you Shippiddge! This is awesome!
My 2 bois Charmander and Chimchar are dead 🙁☹️🥺 RIP
:( Charmander died
Hears The Frosts voice Me : Big.Willie?
After 2 years
Finally waiting this for days
I liked the episode. a hug here from Brazil
rip charmander
No! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! We Need Charmander Back!!! We will pretend he never died
How did charmander die
I’ve waited to long for this
Cant wait for ep11
FUCKING FINALLY
Mhm
0:55 Very true, Beaver Society Exists
Part 11 and part 12 pls
12:51 Mewtwo is still fighting that fucker? I won't be surprised if he shows up 10 years later too
Wow we finally got it
OH MY GOSH FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE EPILOUGE FOR 2 YEARS NOW
The snover are so funny 😂 This was such an enjoyable watch! Never heard of this series before, but the comments are really hyping it up... catch me watching the previous episodes for the next couple hours!
Sad about charmander
Never liked squirtle any way
FINNALY ITS BACKKKK
Snover: What Are Ya goin to do now blue shell man? Wartortle: “something” Me: That’s the best line I’ve ever hear him say
Yoooo
Bruh u just killed charmander like that
I'm just sad that Charmander Died:<
ngl i liked squirtles voice more than wartortles
(this is my 3rd comment on this vid lol I’ve waited a year it’s so worth it)   I have a theory, if the master caterpie is dead, and bulbasaur is still in their cave feeding other caterpies, then I think bulbasaur will eventually come to help wartortle and they’ll go to the gods to ask where mewtwo is  because bulbasaur forgot and then they’ll go there and ask if they are gonna take charmander somehow back and yea :) (I also think that the god at the top of the mountain arceus)
Poor charmander
The little shot of mewtwo fighting missingno feels a lot like foreshadowing
Finally
Kanto And Most Likely Johto Regions Are Gone And Having The Gods To Be In Sinnoh Is A Very Neat Idea Since The God of Pokemon Arceus(And Other Lesser Gods) Originally Was From Gen 4 Where Sinnoh Region Was Created or Something.
finally ! released ! been waiting for quite some time
ITS BEEN A YEAR FINALLY ITS HERE LETS GOOO
Arceus Incoming Next Episode!
I want Charmander please 😐😐😐 But Chimchar is soo cool too😎😎😎 Becasuse Charmander shouln't die😠😠😠😠😠😠
YEEEEES THE STARTER SQUAD IS BACK
I waited for this for 2 years!!! Thank you!! Make hella more episodes please!! Sell to Netflix!!! <3
The suspense in this story just keeps getting better and better. Will Warturtle succeed against the gods? What will he ask of them? Where will my life be by then? Will I even still be around to see it?
I was hoping Squirtle would meet up with bulbasaur and charmander
After one year finally
Thanks
Totally worth the wait
Best than the original one Jajaja off course about pokemon in single 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🤣
After a year we get this I thought it was gonna an ahour long
That Snover gives me Xavier Renegade Angel vibes. I love him
Charmander actually died?! and to think that squirtle would step in to kill that bug
Can anyone else hear snover's legend of squirtle in the background? I want to know what he's saying cuz his storytelling is the best
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Finally is here I have been waiting since ep 9
R.I.P. Charmander he will always be my favorite out of the squad
22:58 *lol* *and I even miss turtwig D;* *and even charmender*
after fifty four thousand years its its finally here
OMG i used to watch this when i was 12 .. now im 17 0_0
whatever thing is up that mountain its dead
Chimchar voice actor maybe the same voice of Kid Trunks in DBZ
Now when will episode 11 come out
7:45
caterpie evolve into a chimchar?
Year after year I finally get to see the 10th ep
Love this channel <3 [ we want more of these ]
Amazing episode! I look forward to the next one!
The concept of a character we’ve grown on to just dying,with no twist hits extremely hard, If a series started off here we wouldn’t care too much for charmander or bulbasaur if we didn’t see their journeys, But we got to see the characters bond,rip apart,maybe have their head get ripped apart. Im excited to see the direction this series goes in. After re-watching the entire series while also reading the comments,i have made a theory. What if mewtwo was sent by arceus to deal with missingno? If im right,two mainly cares about his own survival,the fact hes acting as a type of guardian possibly means he was sent by someone. Theres a possibility dialga will interfere but ONLY to deal with missingno If charmander were to be revived he’d probably be reverted back to a gastly when he’s done.
E!
I think squirtle will travel through time after met the god
So in short, Squirtle evolves into Young Kratos. Seems about right
IVE SUBSCRIBED OR SEVEN YEARS BUT THEN I FORGOT NOW WHEN THE EPISODE CAME I FEEL ALIVE AGAIN
Please make it so where Charmander please make it so we're Squirtles saves Charmander in the future okay
HOW CAN THERE BE TWO MORE EPISODES IF CHARMANDER'S GONE
I want so that squirtle reqeust that charmender is brought back to life by dialga that's my suggestion for ep 11 or ep 12
This is the most amazing short series I have ever seen😩
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY IT IS HERE
Is the fearows actor the borderlands psycho actor? 💀
Wait charmander died😭😭
Now that Squirtle is going to fight what I assume is either Arceus, Dialga, and/or Palkia, I'm wondering if we're going to see him defeat Dialga and force him to let him go back in time to try to save charmander.
Thought he was going to say there’s snow way out 9:50 lol
I waited for this for months
Whiatta awesome surprise!
You took so long I thought you weren't gonna make one anymore but now I'm glad I'm wrong love your vids💞
This story was genius
So whatever happened to MissingNo
It’s so cool, I really hope to see more in the future
Kratos:so want to become my pet
Charmanser is dead u killed him curse u caterpie ( sad music)
Too be honest my favorite Pokémon basically going super sayin was just the cherry on top of a great episode
Wow that was cool, time to wait another 3 years
Killed off my favorite character 😤
Where's the lizard?
It took so many years for this
As always amazing and heart "warming", get it, chimchar, yeah pretty lame
Make it quick please I am not waiting a year again
i really hope turtwig comes back, he's really good
Kratos squirtle
Yo pls dont tell me it is gonna a take another year for the next one
…so no bulbasaur I wanted new hats
yesss ive been waiting for thiss
He’ll meet dialga and go back in time I’m assuming
its crazy when u waited for years to see what charmeleon would do and he just dies
Giant abomasnow:"so u have chosen death" My dumbass brain:"pog pog pog meme reference"
Whoa... I thought you were dead and the video was never coming
omg poor Mewtwo still fighting with missing no X'D Also wow, they really kill charmander AND probably Bulbasaur too (like we see all the caterpie society lost the war, and bulba was their food source soo) :v
THAT WAS LIT
Who else thinks he will end up forcing Arceus/Dialga to send him back in time, to either let Charmander be picked in episode 1, avoid capture by the Caterpie, or just save Charmander? Gods were mentioned, time was mentioned.  This series is awesome. Shippiddge, you ARE the very best. Like no one ever was!
Shippiddge when is slowpoke gonna upload episode 11?
What a time to be alive
I wish charmander was alive
YEESSSSSS IYS FINALLY HETE
Dang bro i remember watching the first episode when it came out and i was only 6
Its always a treat to see one of these pop up. Can't believe how long it's been. I salute you and thank you for all your hard work
After a whole year for this
What happened to Bulbasaur did he evolve into Venusaur
0:28 how I feel when they break my Pokeradar chain in Pokémon DPP.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! FUCKING FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They killed Charmander😭😭😭😭😭😢
After so many years we have the sequel we’ve been waiting for 🙌👍
RIP Charmander.  kinda miss him now.  He came back for Squirtle but died. </3 he was learning empathy.    bulbasaur is literally a cow,.    BRING BACK KANTO STARTERS!!  & Bring RED
FINALLY
So, two episodes left, right? Or is it three? This series kicks ass. It's gotten so amazing since the beginning, and there's still so much to go. I feel like the inclusion of Arceus (and possible Dialga and Palkia consider Abomasnow mentioned multiple gods) might mean some kind of time shenanigans could happen. I wonder if Squirtle might fight the gods for a chance to go back and reunite with his friends... maybe put them on a different path...
Oh my god it's returned
its been a year
This was awesome! the voice acting was great, well done mate.
The tree guys are funny😂😂😂
I DONT WANNA WAIT ANOTHER YEAR NOOO
This is insane!! Is epic
Straight up epic!
Bruh so Wartortle is technically a God Now and When he Evolve Again to Blastoise He Should Be A god pokemon
you son of a bitch i came here to laugh and have a good time bur now i am sad and invested in this Squirtle /god of war remix beautiful artwork you have presented. How come a simple mortal man like me now go to sleep after seeing this> Your are man man? i thank thee for the 28 minutes and sixteen 16 you have enriched my life.
WHAT, IVE NOT WATCHED THIS SHOW IN YEARS
Holy hell this is good!
The fucking Snovers are the mvps of this episode
Did NOT! expect all that death. Mewtwo is still fighting that "thing". We didn't get another AMAZING song with our favorite Rock Type but got some damn good animation! And that wicked looking Abamasnow! WOW! Nicely done! I wonder how Bulbasaur is doing?
damn so charmander died for real? Now thats depressing  oh well lets go kill god!
Jeez now the long wait is over and it was finally continued :-D
It’s here! I’ve been waiting so long! So good
OMG So worth the wait for this episode, I swear this my fav episode
If that caterpie doesn't die by the end I'm gonna go on fire red and kill every caterpie in viridian forest
You said “fire is the best vs a pure ice type” fire is the best vs Snover because it’s an ice AND a grass type
Finally.....
They did Charmander dirty
We all have been Turtwig
What the f##k? I remember watching this series years ago and waiting for the new episode and here it is
4:35 nice Mount Everest reference
OH MY GOD HE'S SO FUCKIN BADASS!!!
Squirtle is depressing AF but the Snovers are so goddamn funny🤣🤣🤣🤣 especially with the voice acting its chef's kiss😘
Awww why charmander die😞😞😞
Finally
I think I was never going to finish this series, high nostalgia
Huge props to Mewtwo for keeping MissingNo at bay for over 10 years, preventing it from absorbing any other Pokémon.
Yo dude I hope you have more than three episodes for this this little series has been very great I love the humor
10 bucks 11 will come out in 2051
Throwing that bidoof was like when Mario throws Bowser and then he says " So long gy Bowser!"
Wait charmader is actually dead…
It been 3000 years (find the reffence)
The real question is what happened to bulbasaur did he die in the fire or is he still somewhere
it has come. YES!!!!!!!!!!
YES I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALL THESE YEARS!!!
Never been so excited to fuck up my sleep schedule than for this video
See you all next year for episode 11!
This series hasn't been about Charmander and the challenges he faced rather it's been about Squirtle and the mistakes he has made. There is no denying that Squirtle who is now Wartortle will find the pokemon gods and become far more powerful but he still continues to avoid a part of his past, avoiding the loss of his friends. Wartortle will never be the same again not as long as he fixes himself.
Fuck squirtle , charmander risked everything to get him back and this piece of shit let’s him die smh
HAHAHA FINALLY IVE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH YOU BOYS ALLL DAY
This series , man!!! There are no words in this entire universe to describe this
14:38 lol they literally replaced and no one noticed
I’m in love with the anime twist and the nature style music ! And abomasnows design is SUPERB
Yooooooo!!!!
Time to wait another 1 year
Damn charmander died
RIP Charmander. Absolute legend
Chimchar = Angry Killua
thought charmander was the main character but no it was squirtle all along
The wait is over
I’m sad charmander is gone but I love the whole new direction it’s going in
God of Wartortle: Sinnoh hunt.
I can’t imagine how an useless Squirtle in the beginning become a masterpiece character in this ep, I feel the time goes too fast…     I can’t wait for the next ep
My guy did I watch movie this was amazing
“Being slightly bigger changes nothing” I can think of a few things
Man that really does suck though about charmander dying he was my favorite
Damn its back
Waiting for this from years
I didn't expect to randomly get the new upload out of no where
I’m confused, will there be anymore to the series? Or is this it
Charmander: my favorite character Bulbasaur: my 2nd favorite Squirtle: the reason i hate his evolution line Note: you should add something like before they were in the lab a quilava used to hang out with charmander and he hears about his death and since he is a fully evolved typhlosion he avenges charmander (in the johto games typhlosion can use solar beam)
I love Squirtle.
Wartortle is to powerful
WTF EXPLOSION
ATER 2 FLUFFING YEARS THE WAIT IS WORTH IT
AMD very good
Tree number 2 was my favourite.
The return of the kiiiiiing!
NO WAY AFTER YEARS HE FINALLY CAME BACK
I've kind of been hibernating for this episode but there's two more to go crap
I'm kinda pissed off charmanders dead
BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME!! THEY DOOOO!!!
Didn't think I'd be alive to see it
I've been watching this series for years and finally part 10 is here. I can't wait for the last 2
To quote charmander MAKE THEM FASTER!!
heres something  when charmander was being attacked in ep 9...   charmander said: all i wanted was.  squirtle: TO EVOLVE I KNOW, THATS ALL YOU,VE EVER CARED ABOUT!  but maybe charmander was going to say that he wanted to save squirtle
Why kill Chamander
I love this series so much
But mewtwo wanted char to meet him in the cave before he died??? What about that plot??
Rad
Okay, I love you... and I hate you... please I dont care how or when.... bring CHARMANDER back, please.... just.... please.
OMG HESSSSSS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK WITH STARTER SQUAAAAADDDDDDD HAZAAAAAAAAA
My guess is that the Gods are Palkia and Dialga.
O.o Pokémon get really angry?
RIP CHARMANDER & BULBASAUR
Man i love these videos
Whats up with the change of Focus? What about missigno ?
That was so... badass...
ITS BACK
The gods he talked he talked about might be diagla and palkia meaning they can undo everything charmander death would never happen and caterpie wouldn't start a war
Definitely feels like 10 years since the last episode...
So charmander die
Wait is there a chance of bulbasaur coming back? Tho i hope turtwig gets to see his development tho
I’m so confused
15:15 to 23:23 is the part I like best           Spoiler
I'm addicted to stoner bibarel
The best backstory I’ve ever seen
I wanna see this when i play Legends Arceus
1.) This came out 3 days ago and YouTube hadn't recommended it to me yet?!?!  2.) Jesus Christ the portryal of the concept of free will actually is going to keep me up at night and the fucking war shit that went down  3.) It's satisfying in some weird way that after all Charmander did all he did was act as a martyr for Squirtle to carry on his mission 10 years after his death  4.) The scene where the main Caterpie (do they have a name) asks Squirtle what do do and all Squirtle can say is "whatever you want" is actually heart wrenching  5.) The fact that some things are left to interpretation like what happened to Whiskers (did they desert, fight back, wait for the moon stone then run, will they come back next episodes?)   and 6.) The missingno thing going on in the background of episodes since then had be genius and really can't wait to see it expand  That being said, I love the hell out of this series and can't wait for episode 11!!!
IT'S BACK
Amazing
“This move will take us another 69 years!” Moments before the new video
After 1 year ep 10 is finally here
I have been waiting years and have not been disappointed
I can guarantee the final boss to this entire series will be the king of the forest and Andrew will be the one to save everyone, we’ll just have to wait 6 years for that to happen
Sheeesh
Something
Never thought I would see another worth the wait
YES ITS OUT
Gg 2 charmander
This was deep
Charmander died
Nooooo
So squartile was afraid of being responsible for the mistakes and I love how caterpie figured that out and releases squartile.
Wartortle Will just bitch slap the god and go “revive him” “NOW”
Would be cool if charmandar returned
Why does it take two years for you to upload one episode
I’ve waited all this time to figure out Charmander died? That’s tuff 😔
well i guess this is the end
The waits finally over but now i need another episode! Good job with this as always!
Great episode!!   ... now we wait
Shout out to Mewtwo fighting like a g
Finally episode 10 is out!
I literally grew up with this charmander Knowing he’s dead and there’s no way to bring him back killed me
OH MY GOD FINNALLY YESSSSSAS
YESSIR FINALLY IM SO HAPPY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
Who would have guessed this once comedic series would turn into a brutal roller of emotion. Also wartotle sounds like he can sing murmaider now
Ok wait is Bulbasaur dead? I'm very confused
Guys, Look here. 12:50 The battle is seen!! MEWTWO AND HITMONCHAN!!
I honestly feel like out of all the Pokémon that we found out died in this episode Whiskers definitely went out the worst way possible. Girl was trained in the caterpie army and went to war for over 10 YEARS lost most of her family to charmander but still was hopeful they could win their war but then lost Leonard resenting the leader caterpie and ending up either being killed by squirtle for leaving or dying in the war like all the other caterpies. Sure what happened to Squirtle was bad as well but the Caterpies were all Whiskers had so for them to care and train her to then lead her to her death rlly makes her whole situation sad.
i liked charmander untill yknow squirtle killed him so we can't se him for now but if there's some CrAzY plot twist that charmander is still alive than yes i would enjoy it
Dam this episode was crazy see you all next year
The king has returned
amazing. I’ve waited years for this and it was very much worth the wait
Pls dont take too long for number 11
I’ve been waiting so long thx
The Return of the King!! FINALLYZ!!
Holy crap, I how did this series get so intense?!
Snovers cool
The legend has come back
Can't wait for charmander to appear as a gastly
I was about to die before I was able to watch this
Best one left and he is gonna to ask for chimchar and charmander Back isnt he
You.. Killed.. Off... CHARMAMDER?!?!
U posted cringe         Cool Radical Intriguing  Nice Great
wow, the best part about this is the tone. even episode 9 was still lighthearted enough. yeah there were jokes here, but it just feels, empty, until squirtle decides what he has to do. my only issue is wartortles voice, but thats just me
Noooo not Charmander I miss him already
Now to wait 20 years for more parts if this hype-ass shit
Dark souls be lime
Squirtle was "just following orders."  Glad he finally snapped out of this.  I hope the God of Gods gives him back some happiness.
I forgot this series even existed. So happy it showed up on my recommended!!!
Can you make charmander in a vid and bublasuar
So squirtle gonna tell Arceus to revive chimchar
I'm glad episode 10 is finally here damn I Can only imagine animating all of this frame by frame staring at the animating software and spending hours thinking about how the story should go but damn it all it all worked out beautifully see kids this is why you pursue your dreams
This was pretty dope not gonna lie it was super clean animation Just don't leave us for 2 years again please 🙏 😢
now how deep is  blastoises voice gonna be
No its 1 year ago not 10
Why’d Charmander have to die. He was the best part of this show
Good shit keep up the good work but maybe explain more you taking it the Netflix way, Ik it takes long to make quality videos & it really did pay off. But maybe you can speed production instead of 1 year maybe 6 months ?
Bru I waited 2 years for this
I wonder what finally did poor Whiskers in...
I've watched everything
im so sad charmander died i really want charmander alive
Possible return of charmander maybe
What happened to the Charmander and the Bulbasaur
0:58 great char is an anarchist...
FINALLY!!!
Whens the next episode gonna be "SOMETIME" Seriously though, these went from like 2 minute joke videos to a bloodthirsty charmander to the broken grieving squirtle in a destroyed world. I didnt think charmander would actually die, but this is insane. I'll see everyone in another year or so. These videos are probably gonna outlast me lol
🤩😲
has Charmander died?
What happened to Bulbasaur?
Were back were actually back
Bro I can’t believe Charmander is actually dead that’s fucking depressing
Squirtle finally learned the right shell spin
I didn’t notice at first that the hat that caterpie where’s is charmanders head. Karmas a bitch but even for charmander really sad to think about
Nah bruh. They should of continued the real story like with charmander and bulbasaur going to mewtwo
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Finally!!! We can get in with the series
I stared this hen I was 13 and forgot about for a while came back at 9 it took them 2 years so I thought they quit but here we are I am now 20 turning 21
Im sad the comedy is gone lol.
honestly feels like wartortle has become kratos, a god of war, going to fight the rest of the gods up the mountain.
Profound and triggering
Damn Squirtle been through shit
if Squrtiles taking the place of the water type, what happened to Piplup?
I waited a year for this…     The legendary starter squads tale is still alive
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!!! HOLD TF ON.... There will be an episode in other 2 years? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FINNALY ;-;
Let’s go it’s finally out
Cool
Holy shit
Finally I’ve only been waiting 3 years I watched this in like 3rd grade XD
when squirtle goes to the top what if the god of gods make squirtle fight charmander
This is so good, can't wait for the rest. Although I may miss it when it's gone
8 years until now
Rip charmander
Wait so did charmander die
This is a very drastic change of tone, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. It was there somewhat in the last episode, but it still somehow juggled those while still feeling as fun and being as entertaining as the original episodes.  My sister and I have been waiting for this for a very long time and by the end we didn't feel much. The humor didn't feel as well crafted as before, and was kinda sidelined for the more serious stuff. Which would have been fine I suppose, but somehow the way they did it was off-putting and felt like a hard zig for the sake of it. It's not like it's poorly written altogether or anything, but this is a very strange departure and there wasn't much to soften the blow.
0:10 rip headphone users
NOOOOO I WANNA KNOW WHO THE POKE GODS ARE  IS IT RESHIRAM? ZEKROM? KYUREM? RAYQUAZA? DIALGA? PALKIA? OR DARE I SAY.... ARCEUS??
Dude, fuck man. Imma have to rewatch it all to remember.... And I'll love every fucking second of it.
The snover in this episode are so hilarious
I love how they get longer and longer each time
Wait if Squirtle is level 98, wouldn't he have evolved into Blastoise like right after? Also shocked that Charmander died, like he had a whole arc and everything!!  I like how turtwig is basically the audience. I feel bad for laughing at the beginning since it just gets sad.   Hopefully Wartortle meets Dialga so he can change the past.
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING,EVERYBODY STAY CALM
I’m glad to say I grew up with this series
It's been so long since the last episode
here we go again, another 10 years till anohter episode!!! yay...
rip charmander
Holy shit yay
This is so good
Yoooooo finally I have waited for I dont know how long but this is still great
Whoa, amazing new episode~
what hapened to charmander
The way how Charmander died I’m sad
My life has changed a lot since episode nine that it felt as if I haven't seen one of these in 3 years.
time to wait another 3 years for the next episode to come out
Well see you in 3 years
Man. i hope chimchar comes back to life because i really like the aspect of him + he is my favorite starter.
YOOOO LEGEND
Its sad to see charmander die, because he was the main character for the entire series until the end of ep9 and here, ep 10. Wish he was alive.
The guardian Snow is unironically one of the coolest things I have ever seen, you did an amazing job bringing him to life (and then blowing him to smithereens)
I love how squirtle evolved to wartortle and his super strong already
I waited my whole life for this and wasted my whole life waiting for this
The 8 year wait was worth it
It's been a rough time, huh Squirtle?
23:51 - 24:36 What music is that from cuz it is a BOP
no... no no NO... CHARMANDERRRRR
See y'all in two years
I've said it once I'll say it again so worth the wait incredible
I love the flashback at the start
Its my dream come true ;-;
I gotta admit, this was not the continuation I expected to see this series go. Charmander is straight-up dead, Kanto was razed in the war between the birds and the worms, it's now ten years later, we're now in Sinnoh, and Squirtle had a new team. But I actually like the new look already, and I eagerly await to see the story continue
Omg
To anyone who wonders what the characters on Chamander’s severed head that’s on top of Caterpie, it says, “victory.” And yes I was also pissed when I figured this out
Man I love squirtle
NO. WAY!!! MY FAVORITE SERIES GOT A NEW EPISODE AAAAAAAAAAA!!!
RIP Charmander
Very good but I was hoping for a sike I lied and the og squad would come back
It’s been forever
Char the chimchar reminds me of charmander :(
My theory has been confirmed. The best Youtubers rarely post
Who new Chatman set died it was never shown in 1-9
Not charmander 😭
I’ve been waiting for so long thank you
I have been waiting years for this
I pay more attention to this series more than the original Pokemon series, this series is so good I think you should make a season 2 once your done with this one.
Yes finally
It looks like Squirtle hit puberty.
It's about time man. Really missed this series. Cant believe it took 2 years! Very good work! Cant wait for episode 11 and more.
6:05 he looks like me after staying up until 4:00 AM just realizing its thursday not friday
Damn bruh, it was worth the wait. You all did great, that was a lot of sweat and work to make I imagine. :D
FINALLY!! ITS HERE
FINALY
Squirtle: What is an emissary of the Gods...  Evolves  Wartortle: *TO A NONE BELIEVER!!*
squirtle just went into then equivalent of Super Saiyan
GOD. DAMN. THAT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!
Finally
Why Did You Kill Charmander
Aye this is Kinda like Journey to the West, Wukong (Chimchar) was imprisoned for trying to defy the gods. Except Charmander was given a worse fate.
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR 1 YEAR
Omg hype for episode 11
Can’t express my thanks enough that you’re still making these!
wait...is that caterpie's hat charmander's head...HA just realized it was charmander's head I shouldn't laugh but it's wierdly funny how it looks
Let charmander reincarnate
Welp Now i know Arceus is real in here
i cannot belive it, its been so long since I've seen this. starter squad used to be my favorite thing to watch when I was in the 2-3rd grade. wow.
Never thought I'd see the day for this episode to come out. OMFG YESSSS LESSSS GOOOOOO IM SO HYPED OMG AKNCASCNASC;LA
It came finnaly slow poke was able to do it
E
What are you gonna ask?   Something hahah most badass line I ever heard loved the ep thank you 💯
I can't believe Bowser is dead                      (Charmander) Mario (vinyot).
You can’t make me come this close to crying and then throw in all of those random jokes man 🥲 Great Job!!! For the script as well as the visuals ^^
Lol u failed me Abomasnow guardian.
ive been waiting for this
i appreciate u big bibby
after 2 years of waiting my favorite series has finally made a comeback....
WTF
WTF
22:58   Abomasnow: "WHAT THE FU-"  Warturtle: "Your free trial of existance has ended."
Turtwig evolved????
this is a cinematic masterpiece, i genuinely got emotional
Youve lost a majority of your fan base because you take forever to upload these. I get animating and editing take time but not no 2 years. So much potential but lazy creators.
YESSSS NEW EPISODE
God damn it this was so fucking awesome and well worth the wait. The animation was fantastic, the voice acting was incredible, the storytelling was top tier, and the whole thing was just so emotional, beautifully crafted, and entertaining to watch. I am so excited to see where the series goes especially after that cliffhanger ending. To the entire team of people who made this: Nice work!
Sad no carmander
BEST EPISODE EVER!
we aren’t going to talk about 12:49
Wow to think that this series has been going on for eight years. Looking at how far it's come I want to thank you for all the fond memories of watching this series, and to think that it will be ending soon is weird to think about. This episode was what I've been waiting for and so much more. I can't wait to see where you take in the final episodes
Squirtle is level 98? I suddenly laughed for no reason
this episode hit right in the feels, so emotional and moving
I didn't watch episode 9 soo   All I see is Chimchar and Turtwig and I'm just like "????????????????????????????????"
THEY RUINED THE ENTIRE MOVIE😭😭😭
HES BACK
I can’t wait till ep 11 and 12 :]
So what? charmander Is dead. After all those episodes and no character development? Why
Squirtle really giving me Guts vibes
I'm mad about this this pisses me off I spent my entire childhood on this and two of the other characters are gone
@Shippiddge PLZ PLZ WHEN SQUIRTLE goes to the gods can the gods bring back charmander PLEASE  :(
It's been so long dude...AND WE STILL NEED TWO MORE
now wait for another 1 year for another video
Can’t wait to wait another year
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I can’t belive they kill Charmander
So long
OH MY OH MY GOD OH MY GOD GUYS ITS HERE OH MY GOD
wait, if it's ten years later, why haven't they gone to that mountain that Mew-Two told them to go to yet?, remember that... thing, that creature that isn't a pokemon?, have we forgotten that?
when are you guys posting ep 11?
It is insane how powerful of a message this has. This basically relates with soldiers and politicians out there, people usually blame the big leaders for whatever war or bad events happen but it is the actions of the people that follow said leader who should be at fault. Some would argue that they are just following orders or that it is part of their job to be a yes man, but at the end of the day it is THEIR choices and THEIR fault for what happens out there. Not saying that this is how every soldier or politician is like but this episode showcases a cautionary tale of what happens when you become mindlessly obedient with the wrong people and it is amazing. And let's not forget.....we're talking about a fan-made pokemon animated episode here.
holy shit we bacc?
Hey when is the next episode plz I need to know!!!
anyone else smile when teh cattapie hada  melt down?
It’s been about a year!!!
I can't believe my favorite character is dead.😭😭😭
Finally, inner peace
LETS GO
22:49 Oh shit Wartortle just entered  God mode lol
The world needed him the most he arrived
So you're going to use dialga's power to go back in time and save Charmander yar
The way he says “something” just makes me laugh
about. damn. *TIME*
Why is nobody reacting to the abomasnow saying WHAT THE F
i thought it said evolved into wap turtle
Fuck this whole series. Charmander is dead.
Banger of an episode  Definitely worth the wait Thank you for such amazing content
While I enjoy watching the episodes I always hated this Charmander and was rooting for Caterpie. [spoilers] Now I feel strangely validated, I sure wasn't expecting it. Some may say that Squirtle is now more like Charmander, but I think he's more like a good counterpart to Caterpie: instead of being all "dominance of the strongest" like Charmander, he's oposing the "natural order" like Caterpie, but fighting on his own rather than enslaving others.
RIP AND TEAR
Finally lol
I was just looking through YouTube and I randomly found this I’ve been whatching u for so long I’m so glad ur bac I thought u gave up
DYAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUMMMMMMM
12:49 you can see mewtwo facing missingno, I love that detail and didn't notice it the first time I watched it.
Who's the voice actor for abomasnow? And why does it sound so familiar?
Dude Squirtle went super Sayen
2 years for ep. 10 lol worth the wait
yassss finally
Charmander Bulbasaur Die Oh no no no no no
I just realized caterpie is wearing charmanders head
This series somehow manages to surpass my expectations every episode, keep up the amazing work
Wow he actually dies... damn that's hard to swallow  And i know understand why this epidose takes so long
If Charmander really is dead then a part of me has died with him. Rest in Peace Charmander. I'll miss the death and destruction you wrought to save your friend.     .....I might have missed it but where is Bulbasaur......or Mewtwo for that matter since didn't he want them to go to Cerulean Cave.....
Man I really thought that Charmander would survive i really wanted to see them grow but now that only squirtal left it makes me sad
I wish there was a plottwist that somehow Charmander lived:(
It’s about time
I remember this series. I love how much this series makes me feel; “to give complete loyalty” - “I pity them”. And just the “original” ending, it’s a fever dream isn’t it? A truly peaceful {Death} each in turn. OR… MAYBE . Just maybe There is truly someone on top of the mountain. Wartotle for fighting on despite, it all… can we say it’s still you? “It’s a shame” what can actually be above the clouds? WELL until next time-   [I SWEAR GOLD you better NOT BE UP THERE] - Fighting Red I mean.
When is this series getting nominated for awards
What ever happened to bulbasuar
FINALY THE GOAT IS BACK
Not called The Legend of the blue shell man it's called The Legend of the god turtle revenge for Charmander.
This was so worth the wait omg!!!!
FINALLY
Everybody gangsta till the bird starts being a bird
He’s actually gone…
Getting some persona 5 vibes from squirtles evolution
Now begs the question, is episode 11 gonna happen?
Snow sounds like Beerus lol
Aww...YEAH!!!! AWSOME TURN FOR THE STORY!!!
He could have turned to blastose
12:45 Stop fighting that thing mewtwo.
What makes this worse is squirtle saw charmander die thinking he wanted to evolve
Its been 2 yearssss
Finally, the wait is over
OMFG OMFG IT HAPPENED!!!
Finally
Charmander died? I thigh he would evolve
Why Chimchar sound like Trunks from DBZ!  XD
I started watching and so far RIP charmander
OK WTF!!!
cant wait for the next episode wait its gona be a fucking hour long guess ill have to wait 10 more years huh
Finally it’s out
It’s been so long since you uploaded another video!
Woah after 2 years it’s finally here.
HELL YEAH!!! ONLY 3 DAYS LATE!!!
My face lit up when I saw dis 🥵
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
When I first watched this series all those years ago, I had no idea how much I would be moved by the end of it.
This is a dream?
Art
please don't leave again, don't let us suffer any longer
That ending gave me HUGE God Of War vibes! An amazing show with on point drama and comedy! Was worth the wait tenfold :)
Return of the king
Bruh
You better not make us wait a year again🤨
Finally
Episode 1: Charmander and Bulbasaur didn’t get picked by a trainer and now decide to go on their own, bound to encounter some wacky situations!  Episode 10: *Squirtle evolves to go fight god.*
who is excited to see episode 11 in 3 years?
noooo why did charmander die
Les gooo
1 year to wait
Ok I will see you again in 2 years
Love the bold decision to do something different.
Waw
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
SSGSS Warturtle
I’m sad that there’s no charmander
OH DAMN ITS BACK!
oh finally its released
I stopped breathing when I saw charmander's head on top of caterpie's head...😰
Me watching the whole series: WHAT!!
YOU ARE A LEGEND
I’m half way in and I’m going to bet on time travel
Finally
12:51 Mewtwo vs Missing no
So Squirtle evolved into war turtle that is apparently a god ??????
I can’t stop on cliffhanger anymore more I’ve been watching this for 5 years
This series has taken a missive turn in this episode and I’m so spiked for the next one
Nooo not Charmander
Wartortle will probably evolve into blastoise in the next episode
i need the next one NOW
Nooo charmander
What a traumatic story. What was a comedy parody of a story about going out of turn in a battle turned into a whole legend about holding onto the past. Me and my fam followed this 10 years ago and still to this day, that ending with Squirtle (now Wartortle) going up the mountain to fight the gods of Pokemon may have been the greatest ending in Pokemon parody of all time.
Wait I can’t tell, was that Fearow a bird.
Wait what about bulbasaur and charmander
Crazy that this series I stared watching as a kid is finally over as an adult. Incredible work
Lest goo chapter 10
I have a feeling that next episode we're not just gonna see another evolution if ya know what I mean ;)
How does charmander die a can’t remember if it was show or not haven’t seen it in that long
This whole show just pulled an Attack on Titan season 4 and it's glorious. I love how after rewatching the entire series you see that there were hints if this deep storyline from the very beginning! It's all put together so well! It's super inspiring as a novice writer myself!
OMG FINALLY
Bababababoey
time to wait another year for episode 11
Loved this episode but here's some questions and  Rest in piece Charmander But will Bulbsaur return? Weres Pilpulp?(biggest question) And wonder which we will see out of Dialga, Palkia or Arcues?🤔
FINALLY
let’s go
Its finally back YAY
Amazing! :D
Squirtle, gawdamn..
Im glad I stumbled upon this gold
What happened
I like Charmander better
After 45 years he uploaded
why did charmander have to die
I know it's another cliffhanger... But the wait will be worth it.  P.S Wartortle just became my top badass pokemon
Episode 11: Wartortle fucking kills god.
Finally it has been sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooong ha
the evolution (haha get it?) of this series from the beginning to how it is now is AMAZING, congrats on being able to expand and continue this series!! so excited for the remaining episodes
this is the best 3d pokemon battle
This is so epic after all these years you rules this channel is Iconic
omg, it feels like ages waiting for episode 10. I'm happy to see this in my recommendation
w
20 more years later ep 11
F**k the caterpe
Amazing 👏 🙀
Years of waiting has come down to this creation, and it's a masterpiece.
where is the other two
12:51 its mewtwo fighting missingno
Damn right when charmander was 1 exp from evolving
What about bulbasaur???
Finally
WOOOOOOO YA BABY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR, THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT WOOOO
Next 5 years the next episode is coming out😂
Why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YES
Can you please bring back charmander and bulbasaur I don't know how but please do it.
i really enjoyed the video. it inspires me
i HATE!!!! that charmander actually died but now their is more character development
Make part 11
That was nice.
Isn’t it crazy how we all basically… grew up with this???
YOUR BACK
OH THE NOSTALGIA
YES
I personally miss charmander
Worth the wait 😁
This feels like a Madness Combat type situation, something small, just for fun ends up becoming something bigger than was ever intended, and I'm here for it
That was so cool and worth is thanks
s charmander ganna come back
2 episodes left
I came in clutch
You actually killed charmander!? Fuck man.
Big Bibby is the coolest ever.
Call me crazy but theese last 3 episodes might be a start to a season 2? Like what happens after the end i feel there are so manny many regions we have only seen kanto and galar region so there is so much more potential
wartortle=super power  I wonder how strong would blastoise be
FUCKING FINALLY
Yes 😑 life complete
I still hate Squirtle he killed Charmander Charmander was trying to help him they were best friends from the start and then Squirtle just went off and found the newer starter Pokemon
Bro the power up from squirtle to wartortle is like goku going super saiyan
See you in 10 years guys But seriously the next episode will be great
You nailed the expressions. Especially with the talking trees lol
Holy shit!
Starter Squad?     Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time...
What happened to mewtwo
instead of a parody series of just some pokemon's trying to evolve. this became one of the most anticipated lore series.
It’s back!
What if Wartortle asks to dialga go back in time
These episodes just keep getting better and better....
I wonder how the fuck  Charmander die I want to see that ( edit oh wait he die.)
"WHAT THE FU- *explosion*" 😂😂😂
What happened to bobesor
I miss charmander 😭
I hate how squirtle was a mindless pokemon back then, he was the one who said we need to stay together.
Nice we finally got it now let’s wait another year
Time to wait 2 years
FINALLY
I love the snover
Each episode is getting longer
everyone missed the fact that the demented abomasnow mentions arceus literally but called him aruceusus or some shit
Why did char have to die :(
Bru I wait 2 year’s and they just kill charmander off screen 🤬😤😤😤😤😤   Still good tho
Sigh 😔 Im so sad that charmender died i hope he comes back anyways good vid second best one
Oh noooo. My favorite Pokémon is infernape and now I don’t really like it anymore because of chimchar
man, charmander was my fav :’/
Since Smashtasm i knew this guy was gonna be so awesome, im always so entertained, props to everyone who worked on every part of this series, im HOOKED
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES ITS FINALLY OUT
The charmander death has affected me more than any Covid deaths
mabye there will be a bulbasaur episode with him evolving
Wow. This series sure has evolved more since Red picked Squirtle over Charmander. Not to mention each episode got longer and better as the show goes on. So I hope the last two episodes are as AWESOME AS HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally after four/five fucking years
I gave you a year and yyou made this?make roblox videos pepe
12:50 anyone notice Mewtwo and Missingno in the background
YES
Damn this is lit but rip charmander   I have to see when he dies  I didn’t expect these  Episodes to upload  fast
I would bet he will met the Gods of Time and Space (Dialga / Palika) and about his tragic history and big trauma they will teleport him back 10y into the past and will see Bulbasaur and Char again!!
the sequel we never thought we would get
I predict that Red is at the top and that Warturtle is going through Victory road. Since you know humans basically are the gods of this world. I predict that Red owned that Abomasnow and told him to kill anyone that dares going on top. Another theory is that Mewtwo and mew were shown fighting knowing that Mewtwo also despised humans, he could fight but Red is over leveled with his slave team and can easily destroy Mewtwo so he has no choice but to sit back and watch as all the chaos is happening.  Maybe since this is happening in gen 4, a trainer has captured Arcues and making him do all this terrible stuff
I think the snovers are my favorite characters In the entire series
One episode they should go back through time and save Charmander
I wonder when ep 11 is. coming out
YO ITS FINALLY BACK
Awesome
When’s the next one coming out this one is pretty shitty
Whatever happened to Bulbasuar?
What the hell bro It's been so long you you done is episode 10 what are you taking so long what the hell is wrong with you!?
So Caterpie killed Charmander... What happened to Bulbasaur? Did he die in the Viridian Forest War?
So will there be more?
Can’t wait for next episode!
When the world needed him most, he returned
I want to see ep11
I really like this
i love that look they gave squirtle when he evolved, i feel like they should put that cool film cover thing on ur pokémon in game when they get to level 100, that would be so cool
YES YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A YEAR NOW YYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
When ever he fought that abomasnow it reminded me of god of war
Wooooooooo after 1 year we have another one
Finally! part 10 is out!
It’s finally happened for 1 year of waiting we finally have episode 10
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon vibes... love this! <3
Sqirtal takes charmander’s skull and puts it in the fossil recoverer and brings him back to life
munkey actually cried when he found out charmander died
QUICK HOLD HIM DOWN SO HE DOSNT LEAVE FOR A YEAR AGAINA
About time
ABOUT GOD DAMN TIME
Finally it up
First gen:  sees Rattata* wow what a weakling  gets bubblebeam/watergun/thunderbolt TMs* ...wait.....Rattata can learn WHAT?!?!?
Finally after all these years it's here
FINALLY I LOVE HOW YOU GUYS DIDNT QUIT
This video also made me cry, the fact that Charmander died, Chimchar, the leader left Squirtle, WhisKers also died. For this video I'll give it a 10/10, I could see why this video took so long to upload, because IT WAS AMAZING❤️🤩😇
It’s here!
Is that charmanders head on caterpillar charmander was my favorite character
I’m excited for the three more episodes
Mewtwo at 12:51 just doing his own thing
22:57 😂😂😂😂
YES
WOAH THAT WAS THE COOLEST ONE LINER IVE EVER FUCKIGN SEEN
It turned to dark when I realized that the caterpie was wearing charmander's head. So sad not gonna lie
Please make more to
The main character always does not die if yes then no more story’s pf it
U know
Please make more
I’m pretty sad Charmander died, he did actually care about squirtle.
I now hate this plot because charmander died ;-;
"bluey kill him" Squirtle used, gun???? it was super effective
but he died i din,t no i so sad
i knew squirtle would evolve. he was level 98. enough room for wartortle at 99 and blastoise at 100.
The series was so nostalgic and ruined my innocence as a child
Holy shit i remembered this series just as it apeared in my recomended
plz bring back charmader what hapened to charmader
What happened to Bulbasaur and Charmander
this episode should have been called "god of warturtle"
Poor sleep-deprived Mewtwo is literally the only one holding back Missingno and the endless glitch corruption.
Charmander should come back
YES! FINALLY!
If only charmander did not die I am sad ;(     It hits different knowing charmander is ded I just wish mewto would come to squirtle and reverse time ;(
Who ready for the next episode in two years
bruh I'm sad, I thought that Squirtle threw the ultra ball to save Charmander, or he evolved and didn't die
Also why is the song during the credits so banging?
It’s been years!
YESSSS
finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s back my childhood 😭 it’s back 😭
We only had to wait 2 years :)
i......i feel depressed now
Pls make mewtwo go in the past and bring charmander back pls
RIP Charmander </3
Charmander will be so proud of squirtle
Finally
2 more years to go

You could have made it so charmander evolved and won the battle bro chimchar ain't the Same
I love the snovers they trip me out. Cant wait for the next video!!! Great work as always
Abomasnow (idk how to spell its name): I AM AN EMICRE REPRESENTING THE GODS  Abomasnow when about to be killed by turtle: WHAT THE FUC-
Charmander WILL return for revenge. But only as Charizard!
Finally the wait after 2 years it’s here.                      Can you please try to make it sooner?

Reply R.I.P Charmander guys
how the tables have turned
I kinda forgot about this series.This must have taken the full year congrats you finally released the video :D
Damn it dunno why I got this recommended but I watched this then binged the 1-9 and I want more nowish. Love it. It's genuinely great and love how the quality just got better leading up to this episode I'm subbed now and can't wait for more lol you've done something great here the writing is smart and funny and I'm excited for more! I even turned on notifications for your channel! I don't do that for for a single other channel 😂
This is amazing
its been a whole year AND HE RETURNED!!!!
Couldn’t a max revive technically bring back charmander
its been so long....... finally.
I like that he evolved nice when is the next one
Now the wait begins for Episode 11: God of Wartortle
Yeeeeeeeeees
Welp yay we now have a good ending to episode 10 welp time to wait 1-2 more years for episode 11
Lol i really love this series 😂 idk why
FINALLY a new episode.  I'm not mad though, I understand it takes time to give us some quality stuff but man I've been invested in this series for years now. This is tv or Netflix worthy tbh. Sad to see Charmander is gone now and I'm gonna miss Whiskers too. But I do like the direction taken with Squirtle, has a God of War feel to him now that he's evolved. Can't wait for the next episode!
took over 1 year finally its here
For some reason I have a feeling that charmander is alive
wow   incredible
Ñ
F por Charmander
by the time the last episode comes out, we all probably will be six feet under the ground
This was my childhood and I’m sad that charmander DIED
Finally
Finnaly...
I've been following this series for about 6 years now and the way you made charmander get killed off and passed the role to squirtle really surprised me! This is an AMAZING series as it first started as a meme to now a storyline. Keep it up man!
E
finally after years
poor Mewtwo ten years no sleep makes psychic kitty a mad boi
Wow. Charmander died.
Btw no one's talking about Mewtwo who spawned in the middle of this episode? Around 12:50 dealing with the Pokemon bug
Share this to EVERYBODY CHILDHOOD SERIES IS NOW A CHILDHOOD LEGEND
finally
God of Wartortle will continue...
Plz release an episode 11 this is amazing
God of wartortles
Squirtle just became a badass, and it took years for it to happen
I forgot this show existed until it show up in my recommend once again 🙏
This shit is wild😭
Bruh y, y did Charmander have to die. He was my favorite. :(
This was worth the wait
NOOOOO CHARMANDER
YESSSS NEW EPISODE
2:35 So long Gay Bowser 😂😂😂
OMFG ITA BACK AFTER 2 YEARS
Squirtlle is the last og starter
Man I just want charmander back somehow I don't know how like revive or something
Hey so Charmander died (see the last episode (9) that was one year ago already!) but I didn't really understand for Bulbasaur.. What happened to him when Squirtle said "Oh, he didn't wanna leave"? Did he died to or something?
22:58
Asura's wrath?
FINNALY
welp, see ya'll in 2 years!
This is amazing, please keep going good job
Let's gooooo
If you make another episode make charmander come back
This was worth the wait and I miss Charmander
so what did happen to bulbasur bring him back
my man just went and shell smash the dude to hell lol
it’s about damn time
part 11 bro it has to happen
Is it bad I want to see that F@#$ caterpillar die
i assume the eyes is cause he is near lvl 100 so he is ascending into godhood himself for being near the max level xD
Did not expect this to come out but it was amazing
After 2 years it’s finally back
I wonder when 11 and 12 is gonna release
Holy shit it's back, I remember watching it when it came out, so happy it's back
“and what are you gonna have?” “SOMETHING” wise words
Squirtle the veteran
I hope you can get the last two episodes a bit faster Shippiddge. I really love this series a lot and I want to see how it ends~
Waiting for wartortle’s «this isn’t even my final form» moment
I have waited years for this, and to find out Charmander is dead, breaks my heart. He was my favorite character and I love this series so so much. You are the very best Shippiddge.
Finally
So we go just ignore mewtwo
omfg yes finnaly
ITS BACK
Can’t wait for 11 and 12
When you realize charmander is actually dead
R.I.P Charmander
The legend is back!
16:07  Just figured out that the "god" that the giant abomnasnow mentioned is actually arceus, as that is arceus's name in japanese. That means we might see wartortle taking on arceus next episode.  The fact he says "godS" rather than "god" might imply dialga and palkia are there too.
NO FUCKING WAY
I can already smell the reactions.
FINNALLY
So all this time Squirtle/Wartortle was the main protagonist.
The king has returned👑👑👑👑👑
FINALLY!!! YAY!!!! ^^
At long last it has arrived!
This series was made 8 years ago  I was 5 when I saw this and now I'm 13 I'm turning 14 in January 14th
Finally, I never forgot about this
16:00 I was kinda hoping he would just be like "and I'm a level 92" and then just kill him.
Top 10 "why continue living"
Well this was unexpected
Finally
Finally
After 1 year of waiting I found it
Wartortle can now be considered a god slayer
This was a great way to return but come on man there was so long two years
Make episode’s 11 and 12
It’s finally here performing for you if you know the words you can join them too put your hands together if you wanna clap as we stab caterpillar through the head with a stick
Let gooooo I been waiting for this for years
Yo bro why did charmander and bulbasurb have to die??
It happened ong
I can't believe I waited to see what happened to char just to be disappointed.  But the rest of the story was great?
Finally the wait has ended ;)
Time to wait for another year for the next video.
Were’s bulbasuar  I watch more after this and find out we’re bulbasuar is
Holy Shit that was badass this use to be a joke series now it's just wow awesome
Another 2 years for ep 11
Holy shit, since when Squirtle turned into a badass Super Saiyan when evolving to Wartortle.
when war turtle asks the gods something can he ask to bring back charmander?
This series is literally amazing! It would be a dream to voice act for one of these!
i have waited for so long.. like the elvish king waited .. and ep 10 is the best!!!
(Sorry technoblade if you see this) hey guys! Chimchar is technoblade as a Pokémon!
I miss charmander. May charmander rest in peace
Ha, charmander spoilt his own death
I bet I can predict where the series will head and Im exited for what's next here's what I think sqiurtle I mean wartortele will have to choose if he wants to save chimpchar ar charmander
Mf Squirtle just became Kratos
holy shit
Amazing video. Now time to wait 5 more years for the next one.
that was a twist how charmander actually dies
It's about time u make another episode
rip charmander
Rip char but he still sucks
I just hope that we get to see character and bulbasaur come back through time travel or smthn as I think charmander didn't get enough of a redemption to squirtul
I guess now its pokemon evolved squad
Now we wait 11 million years for the next one
Finally!
Thanks for the 10th episode now that the wait is over, but this is more of an anime.  Nice that mewtwo was fighting missing no. 🥶
Epic
Cya again in 5 years
I'm so glad YouTube recommend me this, thank you for bringing a smile to my face.
I miss this channel
Finally!
Now we gotta wait another 6 years for the next episode
Anybody else confused af
we have been waiting
I’m glad the ice guy was an actual threat and not a snover in a costume
Bulbasuar...
Oh my good please make a  New  One
2 more years until next one sadly
I hope these continue
That was cool
did anyone realize the caterpie is wearing charmanders  head
Just to imagin that 10 Ep needed 8 years
CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO KILL ALL THE CATERPIES
Everyone: When is the next starters being relea-              OH MY GOD HE DID IT!!!!
Wartortle: I DEFY YOU! Arceus and the Creation Trio: Cool story bro  *disintigrates him with 4 reality warping attacks*
“Some of my closest friends in the world have been my greatest enemies. And I’ve never even talked to them!” “What?”
Well made story, beautiful work
IT RETURNS!!!!!
The new God of War looks good.
Finally! It’s out! I’ve waited 2 years! Congrats on finally releasing 10.
Legendary. thanks for uploading lol
1 year bro oh my god
Charmander really died noooooo
It’s finally here... the moment we were all waiting for.
*FINALLY!*
i see mewtwo in in the flashback
I forgot about this and then remembered it
jubus christoff Squirtle is lvl98? and hasn't evolved. Like i get learning move faster but their is more to it, WTF happened in those ten years. did the admins come down from earth and reboot the games again LIKE FOR REAL.......    No i can tell this has "charmander" written all over it, from the cracks in his shell to is ptsd eyes. SOMETHING happened to Bulbasaur and Charmander.
Yay
The Snover was the star of this episode for me. I loved every moment he and his twin were present. That voice is too funny!
Don’t tell me you took extra tim to make the other episodes
Oh my god! It's been *YEARS!*   LET F__KING *GOOOOOOOO!*
I was having a terrible day until now!
This video has been popping up for me and I finally stopped and watched it amazing series
This can't be the true end of Charmander and Bulbasaur.
Next episode please
that is a 10/10
I wish charmander lived
YAY
Omg i cant believe it
The gods ARUCIUSUU
I knew that you guys would come up with a new episode eventually!! And it was well worth the wait!! Thank you Shippidge and everyone involved to bring us this extraordinary content. It's amazing, keep it up!! 💙💙💙
I'm Eeveefan15 and great video good job
As the end of every jrpg goes: _ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD_
The last word was literally something like he couldn’t have said to bring back my friends but it was still amazing anyway really well written storyline
FINALLY
I want charmander to have survived somehow or missingno to come back
Finnaly I was waiting for this for so long
Remember when this series was a 1 minute comedy skit?
Finnaly
This episode has done the impossible… it made Wartortle look cool
“I’m a bird! Tweet tweet! Bird sounds! Bird sounds come out of me!”
16:09 アルセウス means Arceus, Your welcome
Mannnnn!!! caterpillar needed some karma  yeah my first choice was charmander
Bulbasaur and Turtwig were my favorites when I was a kid, and they’re my favorite in this series!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOO I can't wait another year 😭
2 episodes left that means 3 more years
Charmander died I woulda paid to see how
It took a year to make this episode
The wait begins for episode 11 until we meet again fellow starter squad fans
Finally!!!!
chimchar best girl(?)
Wait, like charmander ACTUALLY died?
lol loved it
Do we need to wait another 2 years for the 11 episode?
Wow episode 9 was 2 years ago? It felt like less
YES finally
Finally took 2years
I’ve been waiting 100 years-
I can't wait for a hotheaded ghastly to appear in the next episodes🔥
When will episode 11 be released?
Finally I've waited one year
Charmander was so cool lmaoo cant believe he died  but I love this episode
oh no, so no Charmeleon, Charizard, Ivysaur or Venusaur will appear in this anymore? :(
FINALLY
This episode legit just changed my life. All this time, I've always blamed everyone else around me for forcing me to do things that caused me trauma. But in the end, I was the one who followed them. I'm going to change that now.
Ngl I think it's purely lazy that they killed of charmander and didn't continue the series it really ticked me off hope they fix this in future episode by using dialga or something to go back in time but apart from that I'm really ticked off
First 9 episodes parody.  10th a drama;
It Rlly good but 1 year for 30 min it not rlly worth
No one's talking about how long 11th episode will take wait until 2024 when it's realeased
Yayyyy ty man
Rest in peace to Charmander :(
i been waiting for this so long.
Thats one epic squirtle
Wait, so Bulbasaur lived underground ? He might appear again and have some high Hp and Def stats if he fought some pokes in there
Charmander actually died why
i can't believe you made us wait a YEAR for the 10th episode cool though
Yay :)
YESSS
I miss charmender.😢
I MISSED YOU!
"If there really are Pokémon Gods up there. They're going to have to answer to me." "Oh cool. What are you gonna ask?"                        "Something."
"So what are you gonna ask?"   "SOMTHING" Most badass line ever
I hope we dont have to wait another year for ep 11 you do amazing on these
Dang this was actually pretty depressing, for one I didn’t actually expect charmander to die, I expected some cliché* plot twist for him to live. Also I thought the final three episodes would be the trio fixing whatever mewtwo was talking about with the missingno. This was all unexpected and I love it, can’t wait for the next episode.
Wait what that’s it?
See y’all next year!
Why would he kill Charmander
No Charmander
What’s the point of calling it the starter squad if  it’s only about sqirtle
I never thought I'd see the day
Oh my gosh
Pokemon video should not elicit a in depth response from me but damn was this good.   Despite it being sad, Charmander's death was deserved. We all laughed at him killing and beheading caterpie but no one is laughing now. That's because Charmander's rampant murder spree has caught up with him. The few moments he starts to "get it" are obscured by past mistakes and new ones. By the time he learned his lesson he was beaten within an inch of his life and then betrayed and finally killed. All because he was pissed that he wasn't picked and thought he could kill with no oversight or discretion on his own. As good as his principles were. He reveled in crushing the weak, bullying, and terrorizing.  Then here's Squirtle who was slavishly devoted to maintaining the status quo. So much so that he stood there and let his friend get killed and also went on to kill others all while under the veil of, "You made me do this".
It’s back, ITS BACK!
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I wanted this so much ty for making this
are the Snovers Key and Peele?
OMG,FINALLY STARTET SQUAD CONTINUE,I THOUGHT IT GOT CANCELLED
I like how they made an episode focused mainly on Squirtle since he had way less screen time compared to Charmander and Bulbasaur.
Wow can’t believe this series has comeback
FINNALY
YES
Shippiddge it’s been 5 years you still owe us another animation.  Shippiddge- F*ck off
So kanto is destroyed and we move to sinnoh? Sickkkkkkkkk
FINALLY EPISODE 10 YES, although I wished it was more episodes.
i have waited 2 years for this
😡😡😡😡😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡🤬😡😡🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I’m pissd and better ask the gods to revive char and charmander
I have a feeling of where this is going. In the Flashback Mew2 was still fighting the glitch. If the glitch prevails the save data will be corrupted & the save will have to be reset. Regardless I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KILLED CHARMANDER!
If bulbasaur became a stoner my life would be complete
Can't wait to see the finale in 2025
Whiskers T-T
What the fuck happend?
FINALLY ITS HERE I thought you died btw
can't wait for more episodes
ITS HERE!!!!
Bro whyyy you didn’t have to do this I’m sorry but why does charmander and char dies…
Yessssss
Took them long enough
it been a long time NOW ep10 LETS GO
plz try and be quick for the next one I love these
IT’S FINALLY BACK!!!!
Finally
“Hey everyone, listen to these legends” lmao.      *Only 2 Remain*
Is this the last episode, or will there be more?
AFTER 1000 YEARS
Finally it's been so long
After many months the man, the myth, the legend has returned at last.
Amazing
bro I've been waiting for this forever
12:51 was that Mewtwo and the glitch?
Well this was a surprise lol
This is great! Cant wait for episode 11!
I honestly guess charmander wouldn’t survive
Bro what an amazing season finale!!! ♾ out of 100 dude! Or will there be a season 2 that we don’t know of?🤔
Omg finally
holy shit its been years
I’m just curious as to why these take so long
Ep 11?
I miss him :(
22:54 big trees last words: “WHAT THE F-“
They’re finally back...
The Snover having Louisiana accents is hilarious
that was so good
Finally. I’ve been waiting for this for years
Loved the episode, wish charmander was still alive. See you guys in 3 years
i swear these gods better bring back charmander
FINALLY
I miss this series, it's been 8 years since I've started watching, and here we are now
"And with his might, he conquered the wrathful guardian Abamasnow and laid his remains along the mountain trail. Thus he began his pursuit of the divine Creators who have toyed with his very existence. His fury ignited by vengeance and sorrow. Hatred for an injustice of a world ravaged by pain and stained with the blood of his fallen brothers. He is Revenge incarnate. He is....Squirtle."
These are amazing. I just got caught up.
FINALLY
I love this, great job, continue like this!!
I CANT BELIEVE THEY ACTUALLY MURDER CHARMANDER!! I NEED A CLOSER TO THIS SERIES ( I like at the end how squirtle start to think like Charmander does)
YESSSSSSSSS
Oh my gosh he's back don't stop I need more of this series
I respect this entire story so much but if you can bring back charmander even if its a little bit its ok i just want squirtle to have some closure
I’m surprised squirtle hasn’t had a mental break down.
OMGGGG I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR PART 10
Now it's back
DADADADA TURTLEMAN
ITS BEEN YEARS
Seens when this series became soo dark
This whole plotwist reminded me of Red Dead Redemption II so much... One that we loved have died, Second that was a great friend is missing and third have run from this mess and is trying for revenge Like Arthur, John and members of gang that left before Dutch betrayal them. It is just like RDR2
Yes it's here why was it so long of a wait
If technoblead was Pokemon
Hope part 11 doesn’t take a year
??11
and if hes gonna come back
How could you kill charmander
charmander better be alive i swear
i wonder what happened to bulbasaur
FINALLY
12:50 who saw that mabye easter egg of mewtwo figting the glitched pokemon u will know if u watched before the other series
Now we need to wait another 5 years lel
I thought you were gone forever… i I miss you so much…
We want next part please
In my opinion, definitely a much more mediocre episode than your other ones. I still enjoyed it but it hasn't left me really aching for more from this series, it just left me thinking, well huh, alright then. Wartortle was pretty weird too, mostly from the strange voice change, Squirtle was definitely much more likeable before he was captured by Caterpie.
anyone realized 18 minutes in that squirtle is gonna evolve hes exactly 2 levels away from max and hes 2 stages away from blastoise then i realized the name isnt "the legend of squirtle" its "the legend of blue man turtle guy"
Charmander see's squirtle "You evoled before me!Damn it!"
Finnaly
Yes
13:35 and 20:05 Hmm… Shame that Whiskers died in the war, otherwise I’d love to see her confront Wartortle about his past. Kind of in a manner similar to how Squirtle confronted Charmander, with Whiskers not listening to Wartortle saying he changed. It’d show the cycle’s next step.
Totally worth the wait
I'm so happy! It's out! Thanks for working so hard <3
Took your ages.
I’ve waited 2 years for this… didn’t disappoint
HAHA ITS ALIVE THE SERIES IS STILL ALIEVE
Took your ages.
honestly 1-9 were better
Finally
This cinematic universe is better than marvel 10 fold
Give us 2 to 1,000,000 he needs all the support for the gang The starters
I think shippeddge should get more subscribers here works a bunch
Holy shit your actually doing the episodes again
omg finallyyyyy
Nice
(12:51) Mewtwo.
Char meneder died 😭 why
It took years
12:50 are we not gonna talk about Mewtwo going at it with Missingno????
YOOOO
That was so good we waited so long so can you not take another 2 years for the next episode
i realized halfway through the orange thing on her head was charmanders head
Finally
did they kill charmander caterpie got a charmander head on its head
I always forget this is a thing and then it pops up in recommended
FINALL ITS BEEN YEARS
Ayo holy shit
CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 11!!!!!!
After one yearrrrr bro this animation took u so long?
Esta verga sigue? zz
This is great
YES
This doesn't feel the same without charmander :c
One more?
YES
NO WAY
Im Just hoping charmander isn’t really dead
when will episode 11 come out
10 down, 2 to go
Well... didn't see this coming; I hope we get to see Bulbasaur next time
I miss charmander I hate it when the best or main character die in the show
Oh my god what what what ability oh why scooter involved he is local 98 ? So much happened in just 28 minutes? Oh iPad school to go fight a legendary I can’t wait till next episode 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😱😱💀💀💀😎😔😐😎🤨😅😈💀🥸😎😱🥺🥸😱🤨😁🤪😱😱😱😱😱
we've been waiting ages.
This series ponders so many philosophical quandaries, the concepts of choice, self-determination, consequence, and society are challenged through a fantastically imaginative medium . It's really good.
I feel like once he gets to the top he'll be able to go back in time to save charmander
What’s funny is that  charmander wear a caterpie head in the beginning and now  caterpie is wearing his head
DAM dident see your vidios in a long time but it's good to have a new upload also the epesode was VERY GREAT thx for all the hard work you put into this soo you can give us the best!
Been so long
What happend to bulbasaur
Remember how all this started with Charmander getting rejected? It's really sad knowing that Charmander's journey throughout the last nine episodes ended in vain.
Thank you for finally doing ep 10
now to realize of it 3 more episodes, this was about squirtle maybe the next will be about bulbasuar or charmander even if he’s dead.
charmander pls come back
FINALLY
It’s just not the same without charmander.
2 years
Squirtle gonna evolve into blastoise once he gets to the top and just shit on whatever is up there
See you soon my Friend, See you Soon…
This is a whole ass production at the moment and it's such high quality too. Like, I don't know what to expect anymore. All I know is that this shit is good
one question... where's piplup?
Please let Charmander appear as like… a ghost or something later… I need closure…
Was worth the year wait
2 years later and finally ep 10 is here
Amazing how i been going 2 years waiting for this and it’s finally here
10 episodes in 10 years. Epic.
I can’t believe I waited a year for the 10th episode
I miss charmander anyone else?
YES
The fact that charmander died was kinda sad. But this was entertaining.
2 years,      Best 2 damn years I’ve waited ever.
This one episode many years to make or the creator just had to do something else?!
Please keep all these up
But now I am waiting for next episode I can't wait 10months
But the story and the twists are amazing
4:02 turtwig is one of my favoriye starter u can’t be mad at my boi
Omg charmander is died
Can't love this series enough.
wow that was great  See you in 4 years
Totally worth the wait.
Thank you for working for so much I have been waiting for this
Let’s gooooooo a new one waiting for so long
Fat BIBAREL 5:34
bro it's kinda disappointing that Charmander died RIP
i thought you where dead
He’s back and so am i😈🥵
Charmander is one of the gods isn't he?
YES
I will be honest here I love the animation in all but the story is now all over the place now
I wonder what happened , mewtwo asked charmander to look for him after finding squirtle but that never happened
FINALLY OMG I NEVER CLIKCED A VIDEO SO FAST IN MY LIFE
Wait,so in pokemon games there is revive. I think you know what im talking about
But what happen with mewtwo they were supposed to find squirtle then go meet mewtwo to deal with the glitch thing.  Since character died did they just never meet up with him? And is that why u see mewtwo fighting the glitch in the background
I’ll miss charmander and bulbasaur that’s for sure , but this is my favorite episode
The previous episode was released before the pandemic. Wow.
Okay I love how being a slave is so realistically potrayed with how Squirtle acts, like damn dude.. this is intense..
im so sad charmander is gone he is my favorite pokemon
Squirtle Overcomes His PTSD: The Anime.    also wtf happened with bulbasaur
Wow! This all started 8 years ago
I do like that despite the darker tone there’s still a lot of solid jokes
This is amazing
Welcome Back!
See you guys in 2 years for the next episode
can you make a come back for charmander i cried while watching
I think the ending will be the pokemon gods would change the past so that the trainer choose Charmander instead of squirtle
THank you for bringing this series back thank you
i cant belived that  theres only two epiosdes left #when will the glitched hitmonchan  arrived???/
I love turtwig
i think a cool detail going over people's heads is that squirtle is calling him char instead of chimchar due to his imagining of turtwig and chimchar being the og squad.
noooo killing off charmander really sucks! please bring him back!!
Hes fucking back hell yay
My god it's here
I wonder if “Arusiusu” also dictated Mewtwo’s seemingly eternal battle with the MissingNo glitch. It always did come off as odd to me that a Pokémon created by humans through gene splicing and DNA engineering, seems so obligated to get itself involved with serious conflict like this, seeing as Mewtwo would have  nothing to do with the natural order/rules placed by the mountaintop deities. But I suppose MissingNo isn’t exactly natural either, so they’re kinda one in the same.   Abomasnow may not have felt like he had a choice, but Mewtwo of all Pokémon surely has to feel something morally incorrect, if it even was approached by the gods to handle this task in the first place.
AYO WHAT ITS OUT
I love it 😍
FINNALY THANK YOU THIS IS GOLD!
Anyone else see the Mewtwo or…..
So I’m assuming a revive will be used
YES YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ITS BOOTIFUL
I miss Turtwig already, the most level-headed and sane Pokémon shown in the series.
I have wait so Long for this
Thank you so very much for choosing not-charmander.  On this premise ALONE I am now a devoted follower.  On top of that, it is very well done.  You guys should be proud.
Whens The Next Episode
OH MY GOD YEEEEEEES
LETS GO ITS OUT FINALLY LETS F**KING GOO
Now, there's snow way back.
This is so badass. I'll be looking forward to the next episode.
We’ve finally got episode 10, now let’s survive till episode 11 and 12
Almost forgot about this gem no Diamond of a web series
I think Bluey is gonna meet dialga up there , go back in time and save Charmander...
*YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS* *FUCK YEAHHHHH* *THE WAIT IS OVERRRR* *WOOOOOOOOOOOO*
What took so long!!!
Finally the 1 year wait......Ok now we are probably gonna have to wait 2 years for episode 11 :D
this is like a flippin anime bro
I guess it’s the time to wait 2 years for another episode.
I never thought this was coming back
EVERY WHEN WILL YOU HAVE NEW EPISODES? I LOVE WATCHING THIS!!!
So much for going to Cerulean Cave. Actually thought Mewtwo was going to appear to stop Caterpie.
FINALLY
Squirtle looks like he's really been through it, I mean he carries the burden of getting his friend killed who was just trying to save him
Starter squad is back!!!!!
Well, 2 ep lefts, I wonder if there's gonna be a season things. I would love chikorita or rowlet to appear tho.
Finally after a year you slow poke
Im rlly sad charmender is dead :( but still great workk nicee
I really  hope blue goes full mega near the end
Dude you did not just upload a new episode of starter squad this was literally my childhood
This is great and all, and with only a few episodes left, i am realllly hoping we follow up on mewtwo and missingno.
YES WE ALL WAITED YEARS FOR THIS! :D
ima be honest. I forgor about this, but im glad I came back
How is this not on trending. Rigged
Wait episode 9 was 2 years ago? Wtf. Where did time go
Finally ive been waiting for 2 years now
MY GUY IS BACK!!
God of Warturtle.
I think he will use Dialga and Palkia to turn back in time and fix everything.
The snow effects are amazing
PLEASE tell me we do not have to wait another year for the next episode
Episode 11 charmander gets resurrected
Ηοω did you get RuPaul to voice act in this??! 💜😂
The voice acting was spot on, good job to the whole team but I gotta give my kudos to River Vitae. Well Done
This was worth the wait
What hapen to bulbasaur
Im just glad bulbasaur got a happy ending
It’s been a while
WAITED TWO FUCKING YEARS
WE WANT MORE
Are we gonna wait for 2 years again??
NO FUCKING WAY BRO
Wartortal going full Kratos right now
RIP charmander
I have loved watching this series evolve from pokemon spoofs to a genuine action cartoon with a very well written story about trauma and holding onto the past. I absolutely didn't expect it, buy I now embrace it fully, and I'm SO hype to see where it goes from here. Absolutely amazing stuff dudes.
bulbasuar and turtwig leave with choice btw  The fire types are hot heads
YO NO WAY
Русские субтитры? Хеллоу? Разве я о многом прошу?
Its finally out but I'm not happy tbh because bulbasaur just stayed there and charmander died Edit:you could add bulbasaur back in another one because they lost the war so that could happen
Cerulean cave don’t touch anything that doesn’t look real
I swear if charmandaer does not come back I’m going to disappear from the face of the earth
FINALLY OMG FINALLY
I liked the series because of chamander not because of the turtle
Welp  Time to wait another 2 years
this is probably ten episodes too late, but...  turns out poke balls don't force obedience... they can leave the poke balls or trainers whenever they want yeeeeaaaah, sorry, I could've saved a lot of lives with that info......
I'm still sad that Charmander is dead :(((
The wait was definitely worth it!
What if Sandslash helped charmander? Everything would be so different.
This is my favourite episode ever
27:06 Does anyone know the name of this music?
What did the Caterpie write on his Charmander-head helmet?
Vietnam and squirtle turns into spuirtle (flippy and flipqy)
OKAY IT'S HAPPENING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM
Does anyone notice Squirtle had eye bags? And his color also became so pale.
This has just become a Pokémon version of God of War
Finally, when is coming the 11th?
Bedoof :Big Bibby gets here your in real trouble Big bibby:nah imma sit out
R.I.P Charmander :( 2 MORE EPS TO GO!!!!
Wtf
When is ep11 coming
Wow. Just wow. I love where this is going.
ep 11 gonna tale 1-2 years
I love this but in the same time I hate that Charmander died like 8 years just for this why
I really enjoyed the series cannot wait for next year’s episode
12:47 anybody else saw Mewtwo Fighting a glitch that's gonna be in EP 12
Ep 11: a Blue turtle kills the Gods of time and space and even Arceus all at the same time
Can’t wait next year.
I waited two years for charmander to die and "SOMETHING"
What happen with bulbasure
Turtwig sounds mike from total drama
What? Squirtle is evolving! (Music) Congratulations! Your Squirtle evolved into ####ing Super Sonic!
Who is voicing charmander
Epsisodes 1-9 squirtle trying to teach charmander that anger and violence is not always the answer. Episode 10 squirtle ripping a guardians arm off and then smashing the guard with his shell.
I wonder if Bulbasaur is still alive.
A CONTINUATION!
:o NO 2 YEAR WAITTTT
I don’t really want to watch this if this don’t have the real OG’S
I’ve been waiting for a year
Who else hopes the next episode is what happened to Bulbasaur in the past 10 years, and then he reunites with squirtle and together the new team has to try and take down missingno?  it feels kinda off to just completly write one of the main characters out of the story without him even being dead or having a good reason to be gone,
The mystery to the death of Charmander has finally been be solved. He has sadly died to what pablo died to; a shiv.
So im guessing starter squad ep 11 might come out in 2022? or…
its sad really.... i liked charmander . BUT the ending was awesome
It’s here!
This was fantastic amazing work
I know you were keeping the levity in it all at that ending. Still... "So what are you gonna ask em?" "...Who said I was going to ASK for anything?"
ok so, when i first saw charmanders head i couldnt accept it and when i first saw chimchar i thought this would be a 2.0 but sadly he died quickly, i didnt like the concept of squirtle adventuring without bulbasaur or charmander but now that hes gonna fight the gods or whatever shits got interesting
When this came in my recommendation I first thought it was just some random stuff but upon thinking about it I remembered that it is the series I watched years ago
Total awesomeness
I hope that this awesome series gets another episode
12:51 Who's Mewtwo fighting?
AMAZING! Charmander may be dead, but he and his principles live on through Squirt- I mean, Wartortle.
This is amazing awesome wonderful beautiful fantastic
Epic
Really cool really good
From starters to monsters reborn
Finally ep 10 :D
Char sucks and is annoying as hell
RETURN OF THE KING
by the time this came out i had three kids got married and became president
And chaemander
What about bulbasour
Finally episode 10 is out
I can't wait to see Arceus get his ass kicked by Wartortle bro
I was waiting for bulbasaur and charmander to appear and say to squirtle "Hey squirtle, we had a revive"
Wow.  WOW.  Nothing else to say that others haven't already, just keep on adding to this awesome series and take as much time as you need to do so
I been waiting for 8 fucking year
Can’t believe Charmander is actually dead he gotta make a comeback it hits different but bro the same without Charmander
Please say that charmander is alive and he evolved into charizard and is at the top of the mountain
So what happen to bulbasuar
I JUST WANNA SEE MOORREEEEEEE
After along way of waiting, I can finally watch this in peace
Absolutely amazing queue the 3 year wait. And It will be worth it #bringbackcharmander
NOOOOOO CARMANDER!!!
Finally
season 2!!!
FINALLY!!!!! Finally it’s here, but it’s nothing like I imagined. I mean Charmander is dead and I’m sure that is something we all did not except. So when’s the next episode?
Wtf so charmander is dead!? That's the main reason I watched this.
NO THEY DIDN'T THEY KILLED HIM!!!!!
two years later im ready
FINNALY
Yeah Blue Shell Man Guy! Kinda sad Gen 4 starters were used and we didn't get to see Piplup... yet.
YESYESYES
great show i wish that they could at least make this show weekly tho :(
Took a complete 180 from what I was expecting. Even the Missingno subplot seems to have been forgotten. I guess you got burned out and just wanted to end it?
LETS GOOO ITS HERE
REVIVE CHARMANDER
I wonder if Mewtwo is still waiting at Cerulean Cave?
3:00
After the boss fight it was literary epic
I love this so much!!! Can’t wait to see more!!!
Booooooo
I love how Chimchar and Turtwig are having a crisis and arguing with everyone else, meanwhile Squirtle is experiencing true PTSD
Boo
Finally
Yesssssssss!
After a long time
Without Charmander it’s not the same😔
Am I the only, who expected Charmander to survive abd genocide  caterpillars?
See on the snow way part squirtle should have not been fazed by him and say "have you seen a orange monkey with a flame?" And "you don't look like a tree" instead of being a hero
finally
OMG
I love Wathing this I know it’s Maybe gonna be forever to make a 11 But that would the fans love  :>
Dude nice story and all but what happened to mewtwo storyline and the missingno
Well this was definitely worth the 2 year wait
the snover have me SCREAMING LOL
There’s *snow way* you can get through *snow way*  *hahahahahahahahaha*
It came out on my birthday 🤣
FINALLY
Well I wonder if Pikachu was here I always love Pikachu so much.
Anyone saw mewtwo fighting missingno? 12:50 lol
Why did charmander have to die
Jesus Christ it's here
YESSS FINALLY
Charmander is alive right?
WAIT WHAT
where's piplup?
Squirtle evolves he is a god
FINALLY EPISODE 10
this was amazing!!! welp time to wait another year
Oh my god...YEEESSSS!!!! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG!!! YESSSS!!
Bruh my eyes got so wide seeing dead charmander.
Yoooo, finally the wait is over
These beavers are literally the best characters in this whole show lmao😂😂
AT LAST
Finally im waiting this for months
2 episodes left
The legendary story continues
Glad to see this series come back with a bang
I'm predicting that squirtle is going to go to the "pokemon gods" in next episode, and maybe ask to revive Charmander and Chimchar. The glitched hitmonchan and mewtwo fighting it might be featured as well. Also Wartortle might want to unevolve, and there will bediacussion about it.
Did Squirtle just turn into Kratos ? :D
When thev rest gunna come out I love these
Bruh he turned into a fucking super Saiyan
YES FINALLY
Oh,what are ya gonna ask?                Something… ROCK MUSIC
I'm stoked to see the Pokemon Gods. Next year
OH MY GOD, SQUIRTLE IS THE MASTER, AND HE’S NOT EVEN BLASTOISE, LEVEL 98!!!
Pokémon Mystery Dungeon : Explorers of Depression
I have so many question like how bulbasure doing :D and da mewtwo:D
I miss charmander & bulbasaur
I wonder what squirtle did to get to lv 98
When are you sending episode 9
There's a secret at 12:51 where that glitched hitmon chan is fighting Mewtwo I just saw this while rewatching
I want Bibarel's lifestyle  Edit: I need a snover on my next team too
Can someone explain why this is 720p?
Ep11: He gomna defeat Arceus and use Dialga to travel to the past to rectify mistakes!
I miss the squad
FINALY MAN
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
Holy smokes! Woww
Got so exctied to see this come back!
Who actually thought charmander was the mc
FINALLY
I can already tell that Wartortle is going to climb the mountain and demand the lives of his fallen comrades, only to be tasked with taking out Giritina who then summons the souls of all the people he came across as a squirtle including the caterpies, the brids, and perhaps charmander who is not at all happy to see him.
ur back :O
My mans dedication is insane. Can't believe this all started 8 years ago
At last
Squirtle was the one in the wrong.  Charmander tried to make things better and was betrayed by that fool.
The talking trees is the best type of people to talk to cause they are so chill
Yeah bro!
Did yall notice 12:50
Squirtle can feel his sins crawling on his back...
13:26 I just realized he is wearing charmander
I've waited YEARS for this!
I am fucking sad cause charmander died why...just why
a Pokemon
22:58 Ima just leave this here
Let's goooooo
The big ice tree reminds me of zamasu from dragon ball super lmao
FINALLY
you deserve a lot man
OMG FINNALY
YAY STARTER SQUAD IS BACK!
Finally
Imagine if the plot twist is Charmander is alive he used the haunters illution to clone Him So He whould not die 😮
See you again after 2 years
Prediction he’s gonna go back in time bcz of dialga they still have unfinished business with mewtwo plus he wants to make everything right
No way this is back
23:17 I like how the title Is blue shell man guy
Is chimchar the reborn charmander?
Bruh I thought about this like a week ago and now it came WOW!!!,!
FINNALLY YES MY DREAM CAME TRUE THEY ARE BACK!!!!
It's back after a two year hiatus.
Put f in the comment for charmander
CHARMANDERS DEADDDDD NOOOOO
So he is now an anime god
No one asking where the Piplup was left?               Ok
I waited so long for this
c u next year
WOOOOO
12:51 wut is mew two doing here
Why does Charmander has to die?!?!!?
Charmander is like anakin (star wars) or arthas (warcraft) they were trying to do the right thing but looked at them as the bad guy and they died
To think that Squirtle is level 90 I am amaze how that he got so strong that he need to use a anti evolution
Omg I love this!!!! Cant wait for the next episode!!!
see you all in 2 years where we will reunite for episode 11
Big heart bit brain, wartortle we salute you
Noooooooooo  Charmander was my favourite
Soooo is there going to be an episode 12 anytime soon? Im not rushing you but this is just too awsome
He came back… when the world needed him most.
And so, Squirtle became Doom Slayer
i hope the gen 6 will appear soon
I never knew this episode will be dark , shittt.
Sick
Starter Squad : not end yet. Starter Squad if red choose charmander : 1:03(?)
I like but what would happen with mewtwo and that thing? Would bulbasaur come back for the next episode?
I just need charmander back 😔😞😞am very disappointed
Finally I've waited for YEARS!
Is anyone else getting god of war flashbacks
Lesssssss gooooooo
Huh? Is Charmander really dead?  Author: @18:00
Thank you very much for keeping this series alive..❤️
I'm getting Sasuke vibes from turtwig 😂👏
mans went into a t-pose at 14:39
I love it but can you also revive charmander its because its the main character in the first episodes so... It could be awesome to revive him and also show what happened with the 3rd starter piplup because it would cover wartortle if he revives charmander and finds bulbasaur
Really you did late for 10th part. Its been 10years 😂
You actually killed Charmander off???? Less excited for these now =/
I've waited so long now my satisfaction is full
Bring charmander back
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHOT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT WE HAVE WAITED SO LONG HOLY SHIT
NOOOO! Charmander is dead!!!
Nooooooo y did charmander die 😭😱
"you can find out he is dead because there are x's where his eyes should be" that line made me laugh so hard
EP 10!
Come the fuck on you really killed off charmander
Finally
Who else saw mewtwo fighting off the misingno
Omg finaly after a year my childhood animation channel
This isn’t charmander’s story anymore and its sad but squirtle is getting down to business and i like this alot
This is legendary. I like how it kinda shows the reality of us pokemon trainers having all the control and using our pokemon to kill other pokemon. Charmander was the first to deny those rules and squirtle stuck by them. Leaving an amazing battle of ideals. However squirtle has realized how wrong he was and freed himself from his past and takes on charmanders ideals as his own. Brilliant content.
Can’t wait till next year
can mew two bring charmander back
Bout time man hopefully the sequel is in the next 3 years
Is Charmander and Bulbasaur gonna help
This guy just made the world's best animation
Thy finally made episode 10?
Are you a bit late
The legend himself came back...
Omg pog
The slowpoke himself is back with a banger
Charmander was the best and u had kill him off y
I love starter squad …don’t stop pretty pretty please oh please with cherries on top drop more
Bulbasaur and charmander died?
Chimchars annoying  af
Wartorlt should've Dynamaxed though
Not gonna lie...this is a bit of a let down now that Charmander and Bulbasaur are out of the picture. Squirtle basically turned into what Charmander was all along.
I see Mewtwo is still not getting any sleep.
Lmfao when Squirtle called out to Turtwig and said "bulbasaur" I lost it 🤣🤣
After all these years...
Abomasnow: says he killed countless *defiant* souls OP Pokemon With *Defiant* (the ability): OH NO  also don't wooooosh me,
OH MY GOD ITS HERE FINALLY HERE!!!
yes its here
holy shit sharmander is dead 😭😭😭😭no no no his head is cut off
100% worth the wait
holy shit ive been waiting for years
Finalllllllllyyyyy
Finally let’s go
I can’t believe charmanders gone shit is not the same without him :(
Holy shit my childhood returns!!!
Can’t wait for ep 11, this film is really great 👍
WHY DID CHARMANDER HAVE TO DIE
honestly, i forgot i was waiting for this
Finally
Wow finally, 2 more episodes to go, appreciate the great quality work you do mate.
See you guys in the next two years ✌️
DUDE ITS BACK
Oh my god its been 2 years holy shit
Why did it take so long but im still glad it arrived holy crap
Finally
Please
Now
Bring back bulbasaur
Wait Charmander actually died
I swear to fuck I’m a junior now. I’ve been watching this since I was 8 or 7 or 9 somewhere around there. If this finishes after I graduated ima be pissed
I waited years for this smh hopefully the last to are better
WTF!! The old ones were much better!! This is just too screwed up, and what happens to that mewtwo!!? Tis better be a dream or something!! X(
So is bulbasaur dead?
My area! PFFT! That was so simple but very funny. The way he said it just nailed it.
Finally I have been waiting for years it's finally here episode 10
Dude I remember watching this series as a kid and laughing so hard. Thanks for all the great memories. You made my childhood better
2 years later and we’re back!
Shippiddge came through
wartotle did just learnt draco meteor
I can’t believe Charmander was actually killed off
the lore is actually really well done
Finally... after 2 years
so a year of animating just for that ?  this is way more unexpected                      good luck
Okay another year and another vid that means 2022 a new Pokémon vid ok
this is back ive been waiting for this since 2017
Well this was good it was nice to see squirtle after almost 2 years I’m all out to see what’s next keep up
FINALY ITS HERE
when will ep. 11 be here
F*cking finilly
What the hell am I watching?
I remember watching episode 1 when I was little 😭
It's finally here
Now 11 more years to wait for episode 11
FINALLY ITS HERE EP 10
12:51 what was that?
OMG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!
the episode was amazing wartortle character development is so good, also I never thought his voice would sound like a giga Chad lol I was expecting a more adult voice but got surprised when his voice turned out to be so deep which means his voice will be deeper when he turn into blastoise...I will predict that. Also I love how the name wartortle fits with his new personality if you pay close attention to his name WAR-tortle. And my boy is going to war agains the gods, battle of gods arc is beginning I'm hyped
Of course they got lord baduff 😂
Damn you’re still making these?!
so God of war, but in pokemon , neat
Are you kill Charizard 😭😭😭
I really want to see  "CERULEAN CAVE"    Why did Mewtwo called charmander and bulbasaur there ?
He is back and mewtwo is the god in the mountain and he can rest time and bring back charmander and what is mewtwo doing 12:50
LETS GO
OH MY GODDDDD
charmander is probably not dead
Charmander is dead
I wonder when episode 11 will come out
2                                                    Read more (haha you tried to tap his but it was fake lol)                                             Episodes                                                                      Lęfţ
this was so fucking worth the wait i am blown away by everything- from squirtles flashbacks, the big fight, the animation.  its too good to be true—
Change my mind everything changed
Took pretty long but it was worth the wait. ( RIP 2 fire bois )
This release of the 10th episode was basically deltarune 2 being released.
I waited so long for this
When the world needed him most, He returned.       I’ve waited so long for this episode and I’m so glad it isn’t dead. Keep up the great work!
FINNALLY A NEW EPISODE
Chef's kiss
something is missing not just without Charmander, but Bulbasaur too, either way I'm sure there's a lot more to go in the next 2 episodes. I just hope Cerulean Cave is still a thing, was really looking forward to it.
Me: *wondering where sandslash is*
Seeing charmander dead…      Was the worst thing i’ve ever seen :(
YOO THE 10 YEARS HAVE PASSED
Finaaaaalllyyy I have been waiting for so long I thought he died
22:55
What once to me was merely a "joke" or "parody", has now become one the most well-written stories I've ever paid witness to. Thank you for everything Shippidge and everyone else involved in making Starter Squad! :)
Oh my god after all these years
after all this years finally Good reflection btw

Squirtle is my favorite starter and it will always be
You're back

After 1 year
Bruh it took 2 years since you made a starter squad. What took you so long dude
yooooooo i was waiting for this!

One year later and im still watching these LMAO😭😭😭

" Whoever gets control of you next, I pity them." Well godd*mn 😅
Finally:D
i saw mewtwo battling missingno... why do i get the feeling that in the end of it all. missingno is going to break free and they will have to team up to TRY and defeat it
i love this I was waiting for long and it finaly came
What is the song that plays in the outro and who made it? It’s sick.

Yesssss!!!!!!! Patience pays off!!!
Hey man, just wanted to say...    I've been watching your videos since 2/3 years ago and it's been 2 years since episode 9!!! Please remember me as an old fan as I used to watch this in my old channel from 2017 that had like 301 subs before it got banned.   Maybe I've made some nostalgic comments on my old channel, who knows!!  and yes I did notice that WTF- BOOM at 22:58
What happened to taking out the humans?
Wartortle is kratoas isn’t he
Kinda feel sad that charmander died:(
He's back after 1 year

I was waiting for this for so long
Awwww i miss charmander i got high hopes he still alive
Make episode 11 now
The word that is written in charmander’s head is victory in Chinese
Ayo this shit got dark
This was dark too
i hope Squirtle riots in hell
FINNALY AFTER YEARS!!!! (Literally)
Wait charmander actually fucking died Pls be a plot twist
Finally
I miss Charmander so much, even today, when it happened 2 damn years ago
its finally back
18:27 - rip
When the world need him most he came back- Grandmaster of the Jedi Yoda
Chatmander and bulba !?/😩
Oh it here???
Where is charizard balba !?
Wow this is so fuckin cool
i just want to suggest some pokemon that can join the adventurenext episode- POKEMON: Rotom (as you can tell in my pfp) , Nebby, Lucario. Thoose bc yes
Nooooooooooo charmander
Legend has it, Wartortle is still walking up that slope, sliding down and trying to go up again.
Everyone with the name Char is dead  Chimchar  Charmander  I guess there will be a third char’s death
HOLY SHIT ITS BACK
I Will Be Waiting For Part 11
he didn't evolve to re live his childhood you can say
So squirtle is now pulling a kratos and killing every god... great
I like squitle but charmander died sadly i wishd charmander is alive
YESSSS it's finaly here, let's gooo
Squirtle mollywhoppin that fearow had me in tears
That Fearow really caught me off guard lmao
The moment I seen 10 years later I was like “well sh*t charmander is actually dead”
Boy, that abomasnow..m if only real pokemon were this awesome.
My theory, Squirtle will go to the top meet an arceus get angry attack ,breakdown about Charmander/losing friends, get sent back in time to the end of episode 9 and save Charmander(ofc Charmander will be like I didn't need your help)
Good to see you back
You know that his name is squirtle
I have waited 4, no 5000 years for this!
Amazing
thats why i dont pick chimchar
i have watch this legendary vid 4 times in 3 days, only 3 more years for the next one.
Squirtle vs Missing N0, I CANT WAIT
omg ur backk
I never thought I’d see this in my recommendation
When will the next ep come out I have been waiting  2 years for this
This took an year to make?! Hmm I don't know if that's good or not 🙄
Finally it’s out
Damn, Squirtle getting them war flashbacks
I hope that in the next episode squirtle defeats the God thing and gets to go back in time so he can save charmander
It was worth it… Right?
Fuck I missed this because I was only subbed on my old account. Actual comment: This is extremely well written! The comedy, the time jump, and ESPECIALLY Blue Shell Man Guy's inner struggle!
._.             What the fuck
sooo is charmander DEAD?
I hope squirtle goes back in time.
Wow after a long time good job
Squirtle turns evil
Finally
It's been 2 years since starter squad had they're last episo-*notification* *looks at notification* YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
They chimchar kicked God 😨
Oh my god oh my god it's happening don't panic.
ep11 2023
PART 11 PLS
I've been waiting for this moment for quite some time SHIPPIDDGE
I see it now that Squirtle was really the main charactaristic beeing not Charmander or Bulbasaur
Charmander die so sad
I still can't except charmanders death
What happened to charmander?
"DEFEATED- to death. You can tell because there are Xs where its eyes should be."
I love the snover’s voice, it just suits them for some reason also worth the wait
I waited 2 years for this..and you killed the best character..like really..A cliff hanger for two years and you kill off charmander and i thought i was a disappointment this episode is even a bigger one
OMG SL GOOD ITS ONLY TOOK TWO YEARS
HOLY SHIT IT DROPED!
Pokemon of war
Bro pls make it fast I don't want to wait another year
Chqrmander was right, breaking the rules, charmander had the ability mold breaker, he was breaking through the mold that c9vered pokemon kins
Sure, charmander died but this is still amazing :)
I love this series and the story, and I love where the story went, but I do wish that the MissingNo storyline hadn't been thrown out like that. Seemed like it was going to be really interesting. But I also love that they mention it in this episode with MewTwo in the background fighting it. Series is still awesome, and can't wait for the rest!
I dont want to be that guy, but th3 ending was hella disappointing
finally , after 1 year
At last
bird
Is has been 84 years...worth it all
2 more years left,every year a starter squad video comes
Theory:Next episode is all about what happen to bulbausaur?
Omg it's been so long since I seen ep1 lol
Yes,  now to wait 2 years to see squirtle fight arceus and-
Finally
Charmander didnt deserve to die
It's back.
woa i would love a part 11
THANK WARTORTLE
WAIT WHAT THE SERIES IS STILL BEING MADE
The worst personality of squirtle is he always add something he doesn’t know inviting strangers that he doesn’t know to be a good team like when he didnt know ummmm the green turtle starter and when he wants to ask the gods but he haven’t thought of
It has been years since the last episode was out
I can’t believe episode 9 was 2 years ago It’s only felt like half a year since episode 9 came out
Worth the wait
We have waited for so long...finally, it's here and it didn't dissapoint. Amazing work.
From trauma to the game God Of War
So next episode after 4 years?
I've waited a long time for this my litte orange friend...
How the hell did I miss Mewtwo and Missingno at 12:50 during my first watch through!!?!
John Wick but it's Pokemon

9jkfglgj+&    D,vllvs,lfokdf
Finally another episode i have been waiting for years =)
I like the 9 EP because bulbasur used vine whip on surtile then charmender would win
FINALLY this series continues! I hope Bulbasaur comes back and maybe Charmander as like a Gastly or somethin
About time :D
Clicked because I grew up to this, stayed because of Snover! hahahahaha They are so funny!
Found this masterpiece yesterday
Yay the tenth episode at last
Episode 11 concept: wartortle goes up the mountain fights all the Pokemon gods.
Squirtle's dialogue to that monster is awesome and absolutely correct-"we made our choice, you chose to follow, you chose to obey, you are responsible for everything that happened.
I love watching this!!!
Gosh I wish I could meet charmander again
I want you to pass the Japanese translation...
I didn't know this was God of War now.
“you’re as beautiful as the day i lost you”
"Imagine if squirtle evolve into blastoise"
Stickle lmao
lol the giant tree guy sounds like goku black
Charmander-Hat Caterpie plzzz!!!
Don't take way to long for the next one
Why am I only seeing this now!!?  Voice acting is great the humour is too notch
This ep is wen the doom music kics in
I hope we don’t have to wait long for the next ep
after soooooo!! long of waiting it finnaly came out
Hello arviyans
Dont rush ep 11 we understand why its long
This video was depressing (sortive)
Now that i think about it, it was actually squirtles idea to smash that pokeball which got hitmanchan to missingnos dimension.
I thought this glorious day would never come... Shippidge posting another episode of Starter Squad
OMG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR EP10 THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH
With every episode the series gets better and better keep up the great work 👍
I like how the length of each episode gets progressively longer. So this could potentially mean that we will have to wait longer if he wants to keep up this trend
Alright boys see you in 3 years for episode 11
After what.. 2 years we get plot armor and sadness
I was literally DYING for this episode!!
I miss Charmander
I want more episodes
Imagine if he becomes a bastoise. He'll learn Hydro Cannon and it is a rap
ITS BACK BABBY
There might be 2 more what if episode 🤔
damn the notch on this series just cranked up, i loved the first 9 episodes but this one was worth the wait.
okay ... that was really good
OMG
All these years, finally.
Omg no way ❤️
Where bulbasaur and charmande4
Calling it now dialga, palkia or arceus fix the deaths of Charmander and or atleast Chimchar
And on my bday too lol
I love these videos but like if this one took this long then idk when the next one is gonna come out
that chimchar is the resemblence of technoblade
Oh my god the king returner
Come on what took you so long we waited too long
Hehehehehe fire Mokey vs water turtle
The fact that squirtle is trying to stop chimchar to end up like charmander is very wholesome
Finely make a video ather a year
where did charmander and bulbasaur go?
Where is charmander goddamit
This have increased my love for wartortle
Love how he just turns into Kratos
gonna have to wait for eposoide 11...What an eposoide ,I hope wartortles voice gets better lol
it sucks that charmamder did die but wartortle will carry his soul forever and i hope chimchar gets revived
FINALLY
yay your back
Please make your next pokemon episode 11
"Cool, whatd ya wanna ask?" "..Something." *epic music
FINALLY
yay i love this show
This took so long but great stuff
What about mewtwo...
Bring back bulbasaur now please
YEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!
Ooooooooooooo charmander deid without evolving oooooooooooooo
OMG FINALLY MY GOD
After long time you finally upload
r.i.p charmander
Squirtle colour looks paler at this episode. It shows that he is very depressed after what happened a decade ago with Charmander's demise.
Why did you killed Charmander? He was a really good, courageous, never giving up spirit. Please bring Charmander back.. Squirtle cheated Charmander he could have saved him, Charmander wanted to bring Squirtle back because he thought that the cater pies would use Squirtle as a slave. He sacrificed his life for Squirtle. "A friend in need is a friend indeed". Charmander is a wonderful example of a true friend while Squirtle is an example of traitor.   {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{ .....

Welp I guess I really like Charmendor the most. He's actually the most rational one out of the bunch.
is quirtle alright? it looks like that hasn't slept for weeks
welp, time to wait another 2 years. Great episode though
I always thought that Charmander would survive the attack... But he didn't
When the world needed him most, he returned
Rip charmander

Cant wait till he turns into blastroise
Finally after 1 year 😺
Took the long enough
I’m honestly sad that Charmander is dead, but this was still definitely worth the wait!
pls bring bulbasaur and charmander back to life pls pls they are my favourite characters even squirtle so pls
I'm guessing Squirtle goes back in time because of Dialga and Palkia
This graphic idea is taken from new game called Pokemon unite 🙄
About Time!
I hate the black stereotypical voice for snowver
We'll see you guys in 2026 for the finale      But this was awesome, worth the wait 🙂
THE TRUE MAN HIM SELF HAS UPLOAD THE EP TEN OF STARTER SQUAD
This series almost a decade in the making, keep up the awesome work man! Been watching this since elementary school and now I’m entering college soon. Thanks for these awesome animations!

I really wish charmander has a come back
you're as beautiful as the day i lost you
Yessss this series back!!!!!!
12:50
f for our boy charmander he a hat now
Bruh this series has reached so far, it's unbelievable. I remember starting this off, having a good laugh cuz of charmander and Co. Now the show has evolved, giving us more depth and twist that I would of never imagined. You and your friends have done such a wonderful and amazing job to reimagine Pokémon and bringing this to your viewers. I really am grateful I stumble across this series a few years ago. P.s. Rest in peace char, you will sorely be missed 😢
Why did charmander die
2 years later
FINALLY.. THE DAY HAS COME
Why you kill my boy!!!!! Damn
I have been waiting for years bro I am so happy
final love series :)
after a year finally! The series goes on
We have to wait another year and a half now
YOOOO
WHAT!? Ep 10!!!!
wait bulbasaur
Charmander ded
Guess I’m wait another year for episode 11
Time to wait another year for another episode : )
Let’s goooooo
17:50  Defeated...To Death!
I assume that squirtle wants to meet the God's to go back in time and save his buddy Charmander ❤❤ Cause now he realizes that Charmander was right from the beginning
How many years you think 🤔 we got to wait for the next episode
make ep 11 faster this time please
Hey are you having a flashback?
The trainer caterpie has to die c’mon I hated it ever since it killed charmander
HAHAHAHAH YESSSS THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT, THE LEGENDS HAVE RETURNEEDDDDD!!!! And damn good storytelling/ animation omg
Awsomeeeeee loved it
Ok so he just became pokeKratos and I'm not complaining that's badass
It’s been 8 years since the first episode wow
Why is no one talking about the Mewtwo vs MissingNo fight at 12:50 for a few frames? Probably gonna come up again in a few episodes
Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if red choose bulbasaur
This got stupid fast. You kill charmander after all the time to save squirtle
I wonder if the mewtwo and missingno(???) at 12:50 is foreshadowing.
I didn’t like that charmander died it should have been the other way around
Started this watching this when I was 7 years old in the 2nd grade I am now a freshman which is 9th grade crazy how time flies just like that
Man puberty hit Wartortle hard. Keen for the next one!
He uploaded... it's a miracle
Squirtle really said okay it’s kratos time
I year later and it’s here less goooooo, been watching since years ago!
This shit been up for two days where was note squad
OMGGGGG
Is episode 11 about to be released
Finally!
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING AN ETERNITY JUST FOR THIS I CAN FINALLY DIE PEACEFULLY
It has been 3000 years
charmander became chimchar and bulbasaur became turtwig
Wow this took sooo long and great and charmander is dead that was do sad and a good vid congrats :D
After a year it's finally here
greg
Wait so CHARMANDER DIED
FINALLY
R.I.P charmander
snowver is cray
I want the charmendar to be alive
Nooooooooooo
Expectation : A wholesome journey about Pokemon trying to get stronger  Reality : A representation on what war and other horrible things can do on a child/ 1st evo
I like the show but hate it bc char die  by a fucking worm
Great now I want to know what happens next. At least there are only 2 left
I am at peace.”dies in peace”
Charmander died…. I hate this series now he better come back
Oh thank goodness, we have a new episode!  And a long one at that!  Thank you! 👍👏❣️
Now I realize why it took a whole year to make
You are a rediculously talented writer, my friend. You need to be in the big leagues.
Finally Part 10 has come out
Well this took a really dark direction and I kinda like it
Alternative answer by Wartortle at 24:15 "I'm gonna ask them... To get out of my chair."
Silja Tanner got credited twice at the end!
Finally it's here
Its hereeeee
I’m so said charmander died
Yesss finally an episode. I started watching this series when I was 11 lol 😂
Finally
This is lame
13:30
Best part: Greg Hoffman's in this, plus the humor hasn't changed one bit. <3 Also, I love Greg Hoffman's voice when he makes it squeaky like that. It's funny.
starter squad is literally like that one festival that happens 1/3rd chance in a year, this series is growing along with us
I feel like I missed an episode how did he meet turtwig and chimchar?
Soooo... Nobody is bringing up Mewtwo @12:50....? 🤔 Who was he battling? And what was Snover's flashback about!?! So many questions!!!
Yessss YEEASSSS!!!!
So dark yo...
I honestly forgot the leaf turtles' name...  #Infernape4Life
Yusssss
I realized the longer we wait, the better each episode gets
Weve waited, to this journey of years. Thanks everyone for staying and waiting
those snovers are amazing
I literally grew up with this series
FINNALY THE GOD HAS POSTED YES SIR
I love the Dialogue
2:33 So long, gay Bowser!
Caterpie is wearing Charmander yup he isn’t coming back I wish Char won I wish but it’s already too late
This is movie quality levels of animation
I did not expect this and I'm loving it.
I feel bad for Charmander he was my favorite :(
FINALLY ITS MADE!!!!!
“You attacked out of turn.”  That’s even stupider to comment on
It's been 2YEARS!
But how did bulbasaur die if he even did. I’m just assuming he got sucked dry or buried in the tunnels since he stuck down there. I just want some clarity tho man
0_0
Finnaly you was going so slow
Thank you.
It is killing me snow sounds exactly like a famous actor! But I just cant pin point it. I wanna say from like a lord of the rings type movie. Someone can guess it I'm sure. But good job on there part! Also the snover sound like mr.goldenfold from Rick and Morty to me lol
insane
Honestly I thought nothing could trump the Gastly. But then I met the Snover lol.
Gotta ask we getting blue shell guy versus  gods?/legendary Pokémon?
12:50 mewto is fighting the missingo
This is amazing animation take your time👍🏻
Phenomenal episode. I've been following this series since it started and it's amazing to see how far it has progressed. Squirtles development in this episode is great and funnily enough more complex and well done than most characters in Hollywood movies now. While I am super excited for the next episode, I also think you taking your time with it like you have been will make it even more worth it. Thank you for the great video and good luck!
I can't believe charmander died just like that, for those 2 years I really expected for Mewtwo or Flareon to come in
Finally
"A true friend doesn't care if he's actually your friend. Some of my closest friends in the world have been my greatest enemies, and I never even talk to them." Best advice ever.
Let go
ITS BEEN 999999999999999.999999999999999⁹99 MILLISECONDS FINNALY THIS IS UPLOADED
8:00 *WHHHHHEEEEeeeeezzeeeeee*  ...yeah I uh....should've seen that coming
I’m just sad Charmander died. He wanted to evolve
That was so good but the sad part is that  we waited for so long
That Bibarel tho lmao
YESYESYESSSSSSSS THE WAIT IS OVER THANK YOU
That was beyond amazing. I loved every second of it. Now I have to rewatch it all over again.
Can't believe they did the homie Char like that.. T .T
Can you make episode 11 I really like the series
I thought Squirtle would've saved Charmander and Squirtle would've died. In anger, Charmander evolves and takes out all of the.... worms? (I forgot sry) after that Charmander would've went on to this big journey looking for Mewtwo to learn more, Charmander sees the dead Squirtle in that thingy where he would look glitched out. So on so forth, even thought there's only 12, which means 2 more, there could still be so much added to Starter Squad.
AYOOO
two years you did not send the tenth ep now you send the ep its sooo boring
"defeated to death you can tell because there are x's where their eyes must be"
If he’s level 98 why hasn’t he evolved into blastoise yet or is that saved for the battle with Arceus?
EPICSODE 11 CUZ THIS IS ASOME I WATCH 1 - 9 EPISODE NEVER WASTE MY TIME
Wait ok...  Major charecter died, Pokemon in gen 4, and going to confront the gods... Huge devistating war causing charecter trauma... We are getting a time travel arc arent we?
OMG IT’S HERE!!!!!  Ten years and here we are 😭
its here….
knew he was gonna die
the wait is finally over... It's been 3000 yers...
ABOUT TIME
Finally its here
A round of applause for squritle or wartutole
When the people needed the legend... he came BAK!
12:51 Mewtwo
I've waited so long and my patience paid off . This is a master piece
I have followed this series for 8 years, for 2 years i have checked every other week for a new episode and is finally here!!! thank you!!!
if Squirtle has control of himself, then that means worm pities him.
BIDOOF!!! 🤓🤓🥴
amazing! see y'all in 2023!
I didn’t realize how much I loved this series until I realized bulbasuar and charmander died
The legend returns
I'm sad how charmander actually died and now it's squirtles adventure but this is actually getting pretty interesting
FINALLY
The tv made the turtwig look shiny. I was disappointed when I rewatched it on my phone. :c not shiny
that bibarel was he a snorlax in the last life?
Finally episode 10 is out the tooked for years
FINALLY I BEEN WAITING YES!
To be honest at first I thought Squirtle just kicked a dead body towards a stick that way they both survived
This would be a great video game ngl
I already miss charmander
Why i'm crying:(
Hopefully charmander doesn't stay dead
I think bulbasaur will come back and HELP balbasur
Squirtle sounds like Arlo.
Rip charmander
A masterpiece.
Episode 8 was fun, Episode 9 was great, and this was BEYOND INCREDIBLE!!!   Part of me wanted to see more of this war between the Bug Types and the Flying Types and see what actually happened to Whiskers.  Did she die in battle or end up betraying the Leader and was executed by Squirtle?  I guess, we'll never know, but at least Bulbasaur is okay.  Really hope Squirtle or I should say Wartortle now meets Arceus or Dialga and they can resurrect Chimchar and send him back in time to save Charmander.  Can't wait for Episode 11!
bro it seemed so short, I cant wait for the next episode, I dont want to wait another 4 years lmao
This is the asdf of Pokemon
8 years and we finally get the 10th episode
That was amazing
Finally I waited years
AT LONG LAST YES
I miss charmander
Its out lets go
really amazing work done...i hope you give turtwig a good role
The last episode came out two years ago, and it's been worth the wait. Can't wait to watch the Finale in 2026
What happened to charmander though🥺
Fucking hell, why do the best comedy series always turn into even better drama's with real things to say about life? Well done Shippiddge. You've come a long way since your Smashtasm days.
12:51 Who is Mewtwo fighting?
I’ve been waiting two years for this shit
Now who will gi to mewtwo's cave because charmander is dead and we don't even know where is bulbasaur and i also think when squrtle said pokemon gods he meant mewtwo and arcs
Let’s goooooo finally!!!!!
Finally
Woooo ive been waiting so long love it
Welp time to wait another 3 years
Please make a season 2
I think that missing.no will return and maybe charmander and bulbasaur will return!
I thought Charizard made a come back
Heart-breaking yet incredible episode, words cannot describe how happy I am right now!
JESUS FINALLY
Please bring charmander back idc that he’s dead (for now)
SO WHENS THE NEXT ONE SLOW POKE btw this one was AWESOME thanks for your work I hope the next comes out soon probably not
I’m still upset that we didn’t get to see what mewtwo was gonna do but I did see him in a clip with the glitch pokémon so Kind of satisfied
RETURN OF THE KING
I got a question is charmander alive
FINALLY ITS HERE
Oh shit
So um... Mewtwo? Misingno? Andrew!? I want some fucking answers man
so it's God of Wartortle arc now, up Mt Coronet to face the gods
I never would've figured this would've happened. It's such a dark twist and I love it. It's a excellent twist even. I love how instead of the story being about what Charmander wants to do it's now switching to what Squirtle/Wartortle wants to do. This is incredible, can't wait for more.
😢😢😢
Lettssss gooooo Although my loyalty is towards digimon i just love your take on pokemon  Warturtle basically became Kratos
Even though Charmander is dead but I hope he comes back
YEEEEEEEES
Who else thought that Chimchar was the reincarnation of Charmander?
Also I’m so angry that charmander died please make him come back
Wait a sec, what happened to bulbasaur?!
What's happen if the dragon is alive
When will episode 11 be out
Omg it actually happened
12:49 Mewtwo vs Missingo cameo in case you missed it
Aw man why you kill charmander off?
Size doesnt matter
Why don’t they just use revive-on Charmander
I wonder if charmander will come back or maybe wartordle will go to another team of next gen pokemon
Charmander: Get ready for the storm  wartortle: I AM the storm  Charmander: no no no when did YOU become cool wartortle: what is the first three letters in my name  Charmander: oh ... ok
Ik it takes a lot of time and effort to make these video but for the love of God please don't make the next video 2 years later
where is charmander?
two more episode lets go!
Bro the pain, my 2 favorite pokemon dead lol 🥲 first one was always charmander and then 4th gen came out and chimchar was another favorite, this is some story jesus 😔
after all these years finally we almost got them all
I miss charmander
I’m guessing palkia dialga and areceus are at the top of the mountain
Hey you dude what about Charmander pls make a trailer of Charmander comes back pls
I've been waiting for so long, for this to come
I was in middle school when episode 9 was released and no I’m in high school. MY TIME HAS COME
Cant wait for the the next one
if the next episode is gonna come in 3 years then it should be good
Finally its been years sens you made a episode on this
I tought u quit youtube but no
I LOVED CHARMANDER NOOOO
Finally it’s out!
After 3 years of waiting it’s finally here
Caterpie's deserves to die now in this Series
Finally episode 10 is out episode 1 was 8 years ago episode 11 might take 1 year😀😕
The abrupt change of voice from Squirtle to Wartortle isn't what I expected but I welcome it with full badassery.
And when he was needed most, he **CAME**
Charmander is not dead guys mewtwo brings him back
It's been 2 years
We've been waiting for 1 year for this
So…. what happened to Missingno?
When is the next episode?
WHY DID THEY JUST KILL THOSE BEAVERS
I am predicting that Squirtle (now Wartortle I guess) will meet either Celebi or Dialga, and be sent back in time to save Charmander.
What happened to Piplup?
Legend has it they are having episode 10
Incredible. I love how this went. You gotta love them twists and surprises here and there. I support you so continue on this awesome series
So, what the hell happened when Charmander died?
The battle between Mewtwo and Missingno isn't over
War is hell, and so is running away from your mistakes
Is this the end
God I love this
wait, Squirtle is level 98 now??? woah
Why does he remind me of kratos
Charmander 😭😖
Idk why but Caterpie just became one of my favourite characters (except for the squad) in this series, she was real annoying in the other episodes but in a non making the series bad way.
Now for 3 more years until the next one
Dear god he's back
Really great animation, story, and voice acting! This is an amazing project, one I am happy to see still going after these years.
I think I speak for everyone that we loved Charmander but we need to be honest that he was a horrible person that slaughtered innocents for little reason so he deserved his death. I loved this episode hopefully the missing no plotline is continued and not dropped althought I can't see how it would be continued since the starters didn't follow Mewtwo's orders and it's been 10 years since then. Can't wait for the next episode where wartortle confronts the gods.
Squirtle is smart to take rations with him for his trip up the mountain
why did this take forever?
What happened to bulbasaur
Bring charmander back to life
Starter Squad, oh how i missed you so!
Bring back charmander
This....was not something I expected. And it's a good thing I didn't because holy hell that was amazing!
No cap but i actually forgot about this series
FINALLY
Dude I can’t wait for ep 11 and 12 if they take this long again I might just find a way to time travel just for this
Bruh the first one came out EIGHT YEARS AGO, great vid though
Omg yes!
the first one is was made in 8 years ago
ITS BEEN A YEAR HES COME BACK FOR A EPISODE 10 THE KING IS BACK
AHH YESS
God Of Pokemon?  Pokemon Of War?
6 years
Wow I wonder who would've predicted this I expected someone to stop the that pokemon from killing charamander
I want all of y’all who doubted to apologize BTW wasn’t Mewtwo waiting for them like where that go I don’t like that squirtle voice changed just cuz he evolved, don’t like how charmander died, don’t like how bulbasuar is gone, and I don’t like how the mewtwo plot was abandoned, but other than that I still love the episode and plz continue it ik I’ll get use to it👍
The wait was worth it. Keep up the amazing work.
UI Wartortle channeling his inner Kratos. 10/10
Atlast
Oh my god it’s back.
Poor charmander :(
Pls bring back bulbasaur and charmander plssssss
This was an amazing episode  welp see you guys next year
Finally after *87* years It has come
The Snover voice is perfection. 🤣
I don't dislike this new direction by any means, but its just a little weird you did so much of it in one episode? I'm sure you were no where near done planning this story out 5 years ago or however long, it was just a comedy parody back then. I guess the second best time is now.
I never lost hope... I new they would post again, thank you 🥰😄
Yoooo LETS GOOOOO  THE END OF THE OLD GODS IS NIGH
I had been follow these episodes since I was in High School and today, I still enjoy every minute of this Pokemon adventures, I will wait for the next 2 years to see the conclusion of this series with great emotion and happiness <3   By the way, any notice that Wartootle had a similar voice as Batman? jajaja :3 :D
Cya next year
Wait so Charmander is deadd
It's took a year for this but It was worth the wait, also it got so dark so quickly.
We've been waiting.. Now It's here
Omg that thing scared me when it popped out! Poor squirtle feeling guilty about charmander. That ending though... just made it interesting for the next episode. I can't wait!
FINALLY
What happen to charmander
Now we wait for episode 11 in another 2 years
I love the SNOWVERS! It feels like they all have the same connected mind.
YES IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
OMG another ep Ty! I loved this so so much!
FINALYYY
Finally
Chimchar being an anarchist is kinda on brand
My heat stopped when I saw charmander's head
It was worth the wait
Sad that this means no more bulbasaur😔 I didnt give 0 crap about charmander  But bulbasaurs my favorite pokemon of all :(
im gonna be 19 when the last episode comes out.
Noice
Time to wait another year :)!
I absolutely love how Squirtle actually got out of captivity from the Caterpie’s.  He didn’t escape when he had the chance, the Caterpie leader didn’t die from a joke or whatever, he didn’t try to fight back at all.  Instead, the Caterpie leader (if they have a name then I don’t know it sorry) ends up losing everything and realizes the monster that he ended up creating that was Squirtle, and in a seemingly act of pity, let him go.  It’s so edgy and unique that it actually kinda makes the scene funnier. Seriously, that scene was about a caterpillar trying to receive help from a water turtle.
Yes
plot twist the pokemon god is charmader but evolved into charizard
ITS BACK LETS GOOOOOIO
What… what did I stumble upon?
Jesus christ this is so dark I love it
Yes!!!!
Ik ur probably not gonna see this comment, but like this is insane that the series is about to end.I started watching the series when it was only episode 1-8 and then a while after, I watched episode 9 and almost forgot about this. and then BANG, its in my recomended. Good luck on the remaining episodes my man. Take your time though. Don't rush it
YEAH SOO GREAT
Nice. Wartortle 🌊 this was worth the wait 👍 I like how we went into the future and it's newer Pokemon. The action scenes were intense
I was hoping for charmander to escape alive and for them to go back on their adventure
Been a while
AND HOLY SHIT IS THAT AN ASURAS WRATH REFERENCE?!
Iv been waiting for years but now it is out thanks for the episode love this series so much
We've steadily been building at least one character for each type throughout the series, and if I'm not mistaken, Dragon, Dark, Steel, and Fairy are the last ones left. Here's hoping at least one of them joins him on his quest.
Bru they did Charmander dirty all he wanted was his friend back and they killed him
Bro do you know long I waited for this 🤣
Anyone know what was on the charmander hat?
Now remember when you find a lvl 98 Wartorle roaming about...just Run
I like the flash of Mewtwo and missingno fighting by the dead Caterpie and flying types
My man squrtal just whent one punch man
I actually just cried from this
Finally
I feel bad for squirtle:(
Great, now I have to wait for more years for the next episode to show up.
FINALLY AFTER 2 FUCKING YEARSSSSSSS
God somehow my new favorite voice is the snovers
Is it me that I saw mew two killing a glich
Well, that turned from 'Ha Starters go BRRRR' to 'Omg this is kinda deep' to 'All my friends are dead and I am utterly depressed' to 'Ok let finish this'  P.S good work on this series
Oh my god! I love you guys!
0:18  That's Shippiddge telling us when episode 11 Will ve released
ITS FINALLY OUT LETS GO BABY!!!
The only reason charmander's tries to evolve is to protect his friends. Squirtle's on the other hands don't want to evolve to holding his past
This isn't even an abridged, this is a true show
This is on par with anime
NOOO CHARMANDER. I really thought this story was about charmanders journey and growth and learning how to be empathetic to not only his enemies but to his friends. Im sad bulbasaur died to because he was the most optimistic and happy go lucky but Squirtles journey to not fight for anyone but himself is a great story to tell
This episode sucks it would have been better if charmander was alive
You came back so you ain't allowed to leave now. For real how long do these things take to create? They're really well done.
I can not what for ep 11
Please add pikachu next
Clicked immediately holy fuck
Bro this is the best series I have ever seen
Why does Charmander die
Wow! Sqirtle evolve
Awesome. When will the charmander be picked up and tag along as well?
Why is this so good?
Wait so did what happened with Mewtwo and the Pokedex monster
Holy shit, a new episode?!?
It's been awhile its been 1 year
Can’t believe charmander died
WOO the wait was SO worth it
No way you guys are finally back
People: Abomasnow isnt a god! Intellectuals: There are 4 weather setters. Groudon set the suns, Kyogre set the rains. TTar sent the sands, and Abomasnow set the hail. Abomasnow is a lesser god confirm.
I miss charmander
Holy crap. Now THIS is a craft.
OMG YOUR BACK 0_0
If this is true story I’m kinda disappointed but I’m looking forward to seeing what’s to come
This whole thing woud have not have started if Charmander didnt learn Empathy because of that he lead to his own death to save his friend and Squirtle listening to someone else led to his PTSD of him becoming something like charmander before learning empathy. But mainly if Squirtle wasn't so trusting of others and just trusted charmander from the beginning and not making him so vulnerable
is there going to be a part 11? and more?
FINALLY
Finallly
Episode 10 cranked it to 11
Finally!!!!!
Finnaly. For 1 year it's finnaly here.
The animation leveled up, this great one I loved the flashbacks I hope they tell us more about what happened in that time jump and how Squirtle arrived in Sinnho
voice of greg is just so noticeable.
Man, I totally thought Squirtle was gonna throw his Ultra ball at Caterpie and save Charmander. I guess Mewtwo's gonna be dealing with MissingNo by himself forever now.
Where charmander I not enjoy the channel  without charmander:(
15 years later YES
It’s here.       it’s finally finally here!
THEYRE BACK
The first episode I was in pre k now I am in middle school 7 grade crazy I love the series
I'm naming every chimchar i get Anarchist from now on
Ok first of all awesome, I've been waiting for this for a long time, and here's what I have to say -I like how the series started from a comedic but brutal anti-hero series to an adventure destiny finding a story with a lot of depth and development. - its really sad how Charmander was killed. Why did you have to add that? shouldn't this be his journey as well? He needs to be resurrected not only because we all loved him but also because he needs to stop Missing no.  -I love how you made the pokemon universe even more supernatural by adding demi-gods like the haunter and snow. -I like how Squirtle went from a somewhat cowardly but smart and well-meaning voice of reason to a god of a pokemon who is still tactical and well-meaning but also overprotective, Charmander if he's seeing this must be proud. I feel bad for Squirtle because he's been through so much, from losing everyone he cares about to being in a war to becoming a mindless slave. -I miss Bulbasaur ;( -if Squirtle forms his own resistance faction to make the pokemon world more equal he should add Bulbasaur, Charmander, Caterpie leader, Flareon, Whiskers, Turtwig, Chimchar, Sandshrew, and a bunch of Caterpies and Snovers. -Finally, I have my own idea for a villain in the series if you want to hear it Shippidge?
What the fu- [boom]
It has been to long...
We started this great series 8 YEARS AGO and here we are now 2021
i wish charmander will come back
What a comeback. After all that time...
Random Mewtwo 😂
AFTER A YEAR ITS FINALLY HEAR
Not sure if i want to watch it charmander is dead i think only 10min in
plz i need ep 11
I have found a fatal error, so you know how turtwig  doesn’t know his name? Well chimchar when he is leaving calls turtwig, well turtwig. And the time stamp is 4:46
I have found a fatal error, so you know how turtwig  doesn’t know his name? Well chimchar when leaving calls turtwig, we’ll turtwig. And the time stamps are
Omfg I thought this channel was dead. hell yah. Thanks for posting this 😁
Bro how am I this late I miss this show
Who else notice Mewtwo fighting missingo in the episode
No way
bidoof society is clearly just the worshipping of perfect bidoof
is the next episode is where bulbasaur show up? (man i miss bulbasaur)
Finally ive been waiting for 10 months
Please tell me charmander is coming back
That... WAS A MASTERPICE!! What beautiful animation and the evolution part to and the plot to the thing I have been waiting for longest. Lol thought you died because you haven't uploaded one in so long so I'm glad to se you back!
Ive been waiting for this its been some years
Honestly kind of upset thar Charmander died. I wish there was a plot twist where he is alive but that is far from likely considering caterpie was wearing his head.
I predict that Wartortle will find Dialga (the pokemon god of time) and request to go back in time to stop the death of charmander
DAYUm what an Episode
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
That was so much better that I thought.
I feel bad for Squirtle.  Awesome episode. Can't wait for the next one.
i forgot starter squad existed lol glad to finally see episode 10
Lit !!
After 2 years of waiting it's finnaly here
NO FRICKING WAY IT FINALLY CAME BACK I KNEW IT WOULD PAY OFF TO STAY AROUND
What happened to missingo?
Waayy better than illunination animation
Ah, yes, the Kanto starters:      Blue Shell Man Guy Orange Tail Fire Lizard Green Plant Seed Frog   Oh and also  Yellow Cheeks Sparky Mouse
Noooooo, Charmander, my heart is broken.
THE WAIT IS OVER MY COMRADES
Oh wow what a cool video I like were when he remebered all the times the Caterpie Forced him to kill and he took all of that anger and destroyed the level 1,000 Pokemon and evolved in to Wartortle😁
Wow that’s a long episode
YES FINALLY THE 10TH EPISODE!!!!
You better make more soon I'm tired of  2 years for another episode
This was so epic
Holy cow! They are still making these insane!
2 years later ep 11
Rip bozo. Charmander got put in a box.
I thought he gonna skip to blastoise but I guess that’s for the final battle against Arceus lol
the no way home trailer was delayed for this masterpiece
Finally I can rest UwU
Worth the wait
I’m sad charmander
No freaking way
A little pissed Charmanders dead but great episode
Poor Charmander right when the guy made a positive change he was betrayed by his friend and killed by the caterpie leader.
My question is why it took so long not to be mean but its been quite a while
I feel so dumb for looking at the last episode but paying attention to the credits when you could see that charmander was dead
Make them faster. It took 2 years for you to make this one.
Those trees are hilarious
LLLEEEETS GOOOOOO
I wonder what happened to Durdle (Andrew) that bird and the Flareon
fuck yes a new episode! can't believe im watching it just a few days after release. I didn't even watch "what if?" so fast
I waited so long for this ep
i thought charmander was gonna evolve
this should be a real show
Finally
THEY ARE BACK LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i saw this and i ligit forgot every thing about this Series and i thought this wasnt a thing lol its been so long but this is really good
LET"S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
Dang I miss Charmander :(
Make sure you guys remember missingno is still around, I have a feeling something big is going to happen with him
Charmander.. 🥺🥺😭😭
This is a nice surprise
FunFact: The god is Arceus

Over one year later we finally have it
anyone mind expaining wtf happened inbetween ep 9 and 10 why is he a chimchar
I'm in the store watching this and I found a damn charmander plushie. RIP Charmander
im happy its finally here
Yay he is back
Omg its hereee
we have to wait five years for 10 years
Wow
Welp time for a 10 year wait
it took 2 years but it was worth it
YES ITS FINALLY OUT
God of war: pokemon
Plot twist its really charizard up there
This is my first best one in the whole world thank you for making it thank you guys whoever made them you guys rock my heart
Where is bulbasaur!?!?
Nooo charmander
The heck happened to charmander
When it was mentioned that squirtle was level 98 I felt like there was an evolution coming because it was too perfect
Its finnaly back!!
its been a while..
Took 1 year
HOW DARE U KILL CHARMANDER I’ve been watching since ep 1! And omg the animation in this is unbelievable the lighting the movement of the snow the rendering everything looks so beautiful congrats on the hard work it paid off! And squirtle finnaly evolved!! But seriously you did amazing with this animation and all you did was make me want to see the next episode even more! Keep up the good work! Always is squirtle becoming a god himself?
I’m glad the monkey society did not kill the beaver society.
Yes it bac
YOU’RE BACK YAYA
I've been waiting for so long for another episode
great episode 10. when will 11 come out?
R.I.P Charmander 😔😭
Been years
Awesome epic indinscribible
are you going to put episode 11
He is level 98 he should have evolved into blastios
NO NOT CHARAZARD NOOOO
I hate squirtle so much
Finally
I thought u where done
Charmander and Chimchar will revive?
These episodes comes so rarely that I always forgot what happened earlier (this has happened to me a few times). I guess I won’t watch these until all the episodes are done lol   PS: I fully understand that animation / voice acting takes lot of time and that people have their own lives too
I was crying the entire time yesterday because rip Charmander for real that was pretty much messed up and also to finally Squirtle final evolved
At the end of the day, Charmander really DID have the right idea. Instead of falling in line with whatever rules were in place, they could’ve just done whatever they can to break the mold and avoid that whole fiasco.
I've waited 1 year for this
Finally
The return of the king
Great work, it was worth the wait :)
I have watched it since it came out
F8nal after years of wait
I wanted to see the rest about charmander and squirrel I wouldent realize that he would just die that’s weird now it’s all changed
Post Charmander Death shows the dynamic of what Squirtle and why he is a badass also showing why he evolved showing chimchar appreciation
wow after all those years.. it's not an understatement to say that you changed many people lives with this series Obviously so much efforts has been put into each video, also when I think about it, I don't think you can monetize this at all. Well even if you can monetize it, I wish you the best and will support on patreon when I can
Very rare to have a 10 year wait for a satisfying episode. EPIC
I was a bit confused in the beginning, because it seemed like the story had just abandoned the older characters. Then I saw Caterpie’s hat.
Yay
uh... make another series. about something else, what fully happened in between and with the flashback, or a different timeline where charmander servived!
This series truly is amazing. But it’s gonna be hard to enjoy this series without charmander. Who knows, maybe squirtle will ask to bring him back. Bulbasaur too. Forget the FREAKING monkey, I want the first 3 back.
13:30 *Whiskers will remember that*
now i see why it takes over 1 year
Why would charmander have to die 😭
ISALL MEWTO IN THE EPISODE
imagine if red is at the top
My theory is things get out of hand with the pixel evil hitmonchan and threatens everyone so squirtle needs help to defeat it and resurrects both chars, and brings back bulba to fight it
Glad your back
isnt base squirtle level 98 meaning that he could beat the abomasnow with one blast sense its prob like level 40-70
…FANALLY
this episode just made me appreciate and love snover a lot more :')
Finally
oh thank Arceus, it's finally here ! How i've missed you Starter Squad!
I cant breathe, you haven't posted a damn episode in years
We've waited for a while, and the result is amazing! Good job on everything!  The emotions Squirtle have, are really amazing. I didnt think Charmander would die, but I have some small bit of hope we get to see him, just one last time.   Awaits a new episode next year or next next year!
turtwig is my favorite part of this
Oh my god, fucking yes!
Loved this episode
Alright bois, see you guys in the next millennia.
FINALLY😀😀😀
I hate how you killed off the best starter but great story nonetheless
Saw this and immediately had to stop before starting because this deserves to be watched on the living room tv 🤣
"Hey everyone, come listen to these legends" absolutely brilliant!!!!
Can’t wait for the next episode in a few years
Charmander died?
When will the next episode come out?

Are all fire starters,  assholes?
yyaayayayayay it came oooooooouuuuuuttttttttttttttttttt
No! Why did Charmander die!? I mean, it’s somewhat karma for Charmander, but damn! Lol
F I N N L Y
I thought squirtle died Sad charmander Charmander was my favorite character
Legendary, also anyone get the feeling that when he was talking to chimchar at the end, he was also talking about charmander?
Welp, wortortle will have to take 2 years to get to the top.
The King has Returned
Finally
FINALLY
Omg it’s back
squirtle family getting the attention they deserve ic ic
They just left us on a cliffhanger turtle becomes badass
"Squirt... Squirt Squirtle Squirtle." ~ Squirtle
ngl he really fast at making these
I think he’s depressed I think BLUE SHELL MAN GUY IS DEPRESSED
I'm guessing since this episode (awesome btw) was dedicated to squirtle and 9 was for charmander (Sort of; his death?) maybe the next one will be bulbasaur
Are those Snovers the voice from the  animation PowerTrip? Sounds exactly like the science guy.
This sucks way you kill charmander
Bring back charmander
Theory on the next episode we will take a look at lavander tower and see charmanders soul or something because the haunter in episode 8 said "this is what you turn into when you die btw" and charmander died so it could be a possibility. shippiddge if you see this pin this if u want so others can see this theory or do what you want and good luck making episode 12 its going to be a banger.
So we just gonna ignore the fact that mewtwo and mew showed up for like 1 sec fighting each other then left???
Give credits to charmander  they cut off his head😣
2 years damn it!!!!
Two more episodes to go this is not the end but soon it will be
I rlly want charmander to come back
FINALLY
Yoooo Finally a new episode!
I went insane when I saw this in my recommended
what happened to Turtwig?
2:32 haha bidoof go spin
God of Wartortle
The time it took to release this was so worth it! Keep up the good work.
What happened  to bulbasaur  and charmander
I started this series when I was like 9 I am now 16 when the hell did time go so fast
Incredible
Where's mudkip
No they can’t just take charmander like that
Turtwig
Damn this episode is good but did Charmander auctully and what happened to Bulbasaur?
10/10
I missed charmander
Finaly
The reveal of it being 10 years later and everything happening in between is so dark. I’d love a spin off after this series of events that happened during those 10 years.
This was really good. I like the change of direction. Now we wait another year for 11. 2ep remain.
ANARCHY WILL PREVAIL!!!
This hit me in the feels. Wonderful!
ngl we gonna need another series ong
IVE BEEN WAITINGGGGGG
I have been waiting since 2015 for the next episode and since then the animation gotten better

OMG IM ABCK AFTER YEARSSSS
The voice acting for this, wow.
I cant wait that the Next one comes out in 2022

Rip charmander
I saddened that Charmander died. But I'm happy that Squirtle finally let go of the past & gained his true power.
This series is getting darker and darker, and I'm all for it.
Squirtle became a whittled old war veteran.
What about Charmander
Never expected this series to introduce the other pokemon... All this time I thought it was gonna be kanto based... But I loved it. Worth the wait Congrats Shippidge props

Finally
Ngl I'm sad that charmander died anyone else sad?
PTSD.
Bro he good?
Please  is Mike episode 11
It’s here it’s here
Charmander hast to still be alive he’s my favorite character please be reincarnated by the gods
7:57 its charmander's head
tbh I hate this so much bcuz they kill charmander them bastards
0:26 when chimchar appeared i thought it was a new character and a new story
YO YO YOOOO
Charmander actually died I can’t believe it
More
Final I’ve been waiting for over a year then this was in my feed
Ok I have several questions for starters  How did charmander die What happened to bulbasour  How did squirtile end up like this  Like I’ve seen all the previous episodes and yet I’m still confused  Nonetheless it was a great episode as always your work never fails to amaze me I hope one day I can make amazing animations like this someday
If wartortles voice is that deep I wonder how it would sound as a blastoise…
Omg tysm i have been waiting for so long for this pls make more way more
If anyone has watched the ending of episode 5, you will see the same mountain as it is in here, what a coincidence!!!!
Yes
FINELY
The first character to speak
R.I.P Charmander
I'm very disappointed that Charmander is dead R.I.P😩😩😫
Finally after two years it’s here
NOOOOOOO CHARMANDER WAS MY FAVE CHARACTER :((((((
FINALLY
Is  it me or do you feel like squirtle is the new main character???
thats actually really sad. Charmander was funny and stuff,i miss Bulbasaur too
I didnt know he died 😭
That was good I like when wartrutle was all shiny
hes back
That
FINALLY YES A NEW ONE
You guys been waiting 2 years to find out about Charmaine wells here's squirter and we're shifting the focus of the show to blue shell man and teeing up for an ending no one asked for and only became relevant now and were just cut the ending we spent a decade building. Such a screw you to your own fan base kinda feel like saying it was all bulbasaurs dream and starting over woulda made more sense
I'm glad Mewtwo came back at least lol poor Charmander
Why did charmander die
Now that's a 'PERFECT EPISODE!"
NO WAY! ITS FINALLY OUT AFTER YEARS!!
Omg when the next episode coming out
I have never met somebody so voraciously veering copyright strikes.  I must copy you so I may learn your ways.
I can’t believe charmander actually died, I thought squirtle would jump in and save him
Btw if anybody ask what was the words on Caterpie's Charmander Hat translates to victory referring they have won the battle  to Charmander
Took you a year
The only question I have is what ever happened to Bulbasaur?
this all started cuz pablo was an asshole and was a sick murderer trying to kill charmander
Why did this take so long
imagine  restoring charmander from a gastly in episode 11 or 12.
wait a minute? this is the only episode we're charmander isn't in the thumbnail
Finally it’s HERE!!!
Stay tuned as the next episode will be out soon in 2023
It’s continued
OH OH MY GOD OH OH
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 worth the wait
IT’S ACTUALLY HERE?!
😭😭😭 he’s my favourite starter
You really had time to think this over heh....also charmander died WTF
:O he died
At last
YOUR ALIVE
wow amazing
Wait what happened to charmander?
OMGOMGOMG NICE
Ight cool when’s the next episode
OMG IVE BEEN WAITINF FOR 2 YEARS
Hard to go from one main character to the annoying voice one. Gonna miss Charmander he had a force to go forward. Now watching the previous episodes is gonna feel like a bad aftertaste. Going all 9 episodes through just to have him die because of Squirtle. All that progress and growing, just to be axed off like a Kill La Kill character. Also missigno is still a problem so what will Mewtwo do now that the only Pokemon who knows anything is dead?
Finally
I recently started playing Pokémon go and for nostalgia was looking at some of the anime episodes. This however has been the most entertaining series in the history of the franchise. Absolutely love it. Please keep it going!
I'm calling it squirtles going to  force dealga and force time back and change things
Now where gonna have to wait another 2 years for episode 11
Can you bring back charmander pls olive it
Really good work!
Well this wasn't my favorite episode I was expecting something else.
what in the actual heck. Well I guess it's the wartortle show now.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa he posted again
Man fuck this shit :/ I miss Charmander
Guys in the 8th episode, it says that you turn into a Gastly when u die. Does that mean Charmander is a Gastly??
Ep 11 will be on 2023 dec 31
Big Bibby was the protagonist the entire time
23:16 Blue shell man guy
I been waiting for years glad your back
Shit hit diffrent
The wait finally over I can finally watch good content
19:56 For me
Cant wait for the next episode in 52 years!
This is amazing also squirtle could've bring charmander back if he had a max revive.
Holy moly! This has been a hypnotically astounding turn of events! So much has changed since the thrilling previous episode with so many twists and turns!  Both the story and the presentation were handled with extreme care! You can tell by the energy put into the character performances and the polish of the modelling, animation, cinematography and special effects.  Even though there are only a few episodes left of the show, this feels like the beginning of a second season with Squirtle as the new protagonist. And I really appreciated his character development most of all. I can only hope that it pays off in the finale!  Good luck, you guys! But try not to push yourselves too hard.
Another 2-1 years to wait, worth it!
I have been waiting these whole months for episode 10 and now finally it's out
Beautiful absolutely fantastic this is video is just *chef kiss* el denté!
Damn kratos needs to chill
Amazing episode as always keep the Good work up
Now to wait for another 3 years
His trauma 😞
Wartotles trauma 😔
I beg u make another episode fast
Out of curiosity will it take you 2 more years to make the 11th episode or less amount of time?
FINALLY
Mack chamander back  to life 😡😢😭😧
What if the next episode is about how squirtle goes back in time thanks to mewtwo or missing no and changes the future by saving charmander and bulbasaur.
Squirtle hit puberty faster than a freaking regieleki
I JUST NOTICED SHE WAS WEARING CHARMANDAR AS A HAT
It's been over a year and the classic is back
Is there going to be a other one?
HE BACK LETS GO
wow so charmnader really died... and turned into a jumpscaring ghastly... thats an oof.  Also i guess the boys never made it to cerulean cave like mewtwo advised and he was left to fight the missing no monster alone XD
Pls make a episode 11
sad that charamander died :( yeah idk how to spell it
Where’s Charmander
Alright be back in 2 years
Warturtle is going to make a Kratos to Arceus.
Yes he’s back baby 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳

Wartortles voice though
Ok he looks bad ass as wartortle, I love Snovers character and Im excited for the next one!
Whoa, I'm excited to see how all the missingno stuff comes into play after this time skip! Congrats on episode 10 and well done!
Was waiting for thuis so long
Now the year and half wait for episode 11 starts now
When did this series became God of War?
WARtortle will challenge the gods Kratos style
Omg this series is amazing
Ep1 was _humor and game logic_ then Ep10 was all *TRAUMA & SOCIAL  CORRUPTION*
I remember when this was funny and fucked up. Now its fucked up and funny.
Wonderful animation the whole team should be very proud. and hopefully well feed
So much for character development
Wow just wow, go beat the creation Trio and Arceus Wartortle 👏, maybe in 2024 lol
Finaly over 2 years of waiting for an episode

YES ITS HERE
I remember making a hate comment a few years ago lmao
Bring Charmander back
Spirt looks like he is on drugs
Started this series at 8 now I’m 14 and still interested on how it ends
Other people when they saw this oh cool  Me: LETS GO FINALLY AFTER LIKE 3 YEARS SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
"BIRD NOISES!!!!"
Well, we know Caterpie and Bulbasasaur are alive and doing stuff somewhere, so hopefully we see what became of them. And it would be cool if Charmander was brought back to life or something by the gods.
Can't wait for another episode!
After all this time it’s here finally here
Welcome back! This was amazing!
EP 9 WAS LIKE IN 2018 WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN POKEMON?
I’m gonna miss charmander but this episode taught me a lot
ITS FINALLY HERRRRREEEEE
This episode is amazing, this actually makes me want to choose squirtel more often then charmander
Charmander shouldn’t have died :(
Make more soon please
How did charmander die to caterpies he killed like 40 of them his name in their history books was the lizard
i am soooooooooooo mad why did he not save charmander
Please make more
Pls bring charmander back somehow
why i liked charmander
Why charmander
Finnaly have waited 3years
I miss the old teamof the  and wish that Charmander would have never die. But the rest of this episode was amazing really loved it pls don't stop I know what you are doing can tack time and lot of hard work but we fans are willing to wait
I'm glad I only found this now, because I couldn't imagine waiting for five years for this.  I binged the first 13 season of Pokemon + movies as a kid, and this is the best pokemon anime I've ever seen.  Way funnier, much tighter writing, better characters with real stories & growth, and more than one emotional beat a season.  I never doubted Charmander was dead because no other punch was held.
pog
wtf why did you kill charmander
I missed this series omg
I’ve loved this series ever since the first episode came out. I’m so happy that you’re making the last three episodes
I hope charmender comes back too life
Wait a minute Space and time Squirtle is definitely going to save charmander and bulbasaur
F for charmander :(
I know what happened to chimchar is sad and all but dear god he deserved it. The moment I heard his voice, I wanted to end my life there. Thank god he died before he had anymore lines. His voice gave me a headache just by saying the first word. I’m joking by the way, about me wanting to end my life. But I’m not joking about how he deserved that death.
FINALLY U UPLOADED
THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND @Shippiddge returns AND POSTS A NEW VIDEO!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!
the hard work and effort put in to this series is what i aspire to be like i know that sounds corny coming from me but its true keep up the amazing work
I miss charmander :(
FINALLY
But in the season 2
Yeah let's go the part 10 finaly came can u part 11 next fast!!
Squirtle looks depressed....
rip charmader and madey areces is gowing to ruvev him
Starter Squad is back.
FINALLY LETS GOOOO
starters
I want CHARMANDER BACK.... NOOOOOOOOOO  SO SAD
Congrats and RIP to those who have endure almost a decade of watching until episode 10
Wait is charmander now ded?

Welp, 2 more episodes... 2 more years to go; Can't wait to see the next masterpiece in next year;
its been like what 2 years since you last upload? this was worth the wait and now I want more
so how long till the next episode. 3 more years?
Nooooo! Charmander is GONE! 😭
Why did Charmander have to die it just ruined the whole series for me
Finally, a next episode, an amazing one at that.
Turtwig my boi I hope we can see him again.
Its finely heer the 10 epesoede
I find it funny how all the Bidoof have male voices even though based on gender differences they should be female.
I swear to god if I waited to years just to find out that charmander actually died I'm going to lose it
Love the video man! Thank you for making it I enjoyed it a lot!
I don't like the edgy direction the series is going in.
22:58 lol
Bro it has BEEN FOREVER HOLY CRAP
Oh wow look at these pokey mans
Geez
Such an epic battle scene well hopefully charmander freaking comes back to life i wish but i guess its time to give somebody else the time to shine
wow
cant wait for the next episode in a year
Charmander just wanted  his friend back ..and that stupid Squirtle led  him to get killed..this what that poor charmander get to care for friend.. he got all the way here looking for him..and that puny turtle killed him...this is what he got..for all that suffering...Squirtle is no legend for me...Charmander is.
Did charmander ever survive?
Why do I hear Mike Oldfield in Squirtle's thoughts?
War tortle: ggs ez
Where is charmander and i forgot the other one where are thay
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
he better ask for charmander to come back
We stan this Sartre turtle
the voice of snover is the best of the episode ifjkkjfkjfkjfjk
wow this was also extremely amazing i understand why it took so long to make now
what happend to bulbasaur
"what the FUC-" was my favourite part lol
It’s finally here
Well, this was 100% worth the wait.
Worth. Every. Friking. Second
Bruh his name is turtwig
I was laughing so hard because the tree was about to say the f word when Warturtle was gonna fall on him.
That is a very great episode
FINALLY ITS OUT
Is there any way we can listen/buy to that sick music when wartortle started to climb the mountain?  I loved it.
I can't believe how great the storyteling here is! fantastic job!
Finally
please bring charmander make some how. he was my favorite character :(
Enemy
Anybody catch Mewtwo at 12:51
This is the world of Pokemon where creatures such as Celebi, Ho-oh, and Dialga exist. I get the feeling that Charmander is not permanently dead.
Why is there the fire moneky and the other Pokémon forgot name
FINALLY!!!!!
Wait what about Mew two and missingno
Why did charmander die 😢
Great work guys! Love the new episode! Thank you so much!
Yeee starter squad is back
Will you give us a date when the next one is out. Most probably in 2-3 years knowing you
yes
Crazy it’s been 8 years can’t wait for the last 2 episodes
Charmander to chimchar what is next scorbunny.
Will we ever see Charmander, or Mewtwo again?
Yo I missed this series but I can't believe Charmander died
Can we get some respect for the Bidoofs at the beginning? Everything from "Denial of Beaver Society is a Class 4A violation of Beaver Society! Defend ourselves even more!" to Big Bibby to that Bidoof enjoying being kicked..."But I recognize that's an unhealthy lifestyle!" to the argument over the water reserves. All of it was hilarious. Shippidge knew that the rest of the episode would be a departure from the typical humor/action of the series, so he kept this scene to balance out the episode. I applaud this.
Gonna miss charmander man. He was my favourite
This is fantastic. Mad props man.
Finally mann
Wow, I'm amazed! It's so hard to believe that something that seemingy started out as a funny Pokemon fan parody could evolve into a story with a great and meaningful message. Looking back, it's possible that this could've been planned from the start as the lore is really consistent and a lot of things are so well thought-out. Keep up the great work because this is a masterpiece and was really fun to watch.
I can't believe how far the series has come since the first episode released. Never would have expected it. Many thanks for yours and the rest of the teams continued dedication!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Noo charmander😔
This metal music is awesome
Bluey solos your favorite verse
ITS HERE!
A really good episode But i m not gonna wait for another whole year to watch its next episode lol Goodbye😂😂😂
Let The Next Fire Type Evolution
Stickle  Lmfao 🤣 kus he’s got a stick on his head
Squirtle just looks so tired
Fuck, what a great episode!
22:53 when your mother tells your brother to wake you up ,but your brother is a wwe die hard fan
Finally
Is it just me or Big Bibby kinda sounds like Dhar Mann 😂😂
I love how the “vessel of the gods” literally swears
red from episode 1, why did you do this? you have done the best thing ever, by creating a sick story. *claps*
moreeeee!!!!!!!!!!
Poggies
Woah, I did not expect Charmander to actually die. Although he kind of deserved it...
Anyone know the kanji on Charmander's head?
NO FUCKING WAAAAAYYYYY YESSSSSS
That was awesome I look forward to the next one
Squirtel those something important: Vietnam flashbacks intensifies
I love how this series starts off innocent and gets progressively darker. I thought at least Bulbasaur would survive. I thought Whiskers would have a hopeful arc. Instead, everyone dies or leaves Squirtle. He went through an actual war. It went from Disney to Game of Thrones. I love it.
When Squirtle said the Bulbasaur got the happiest ending out of all of us, I thought he is alive until I saw the end of the Poke war Caterpie started
----->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R ----->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSlhjwzn3utvcw6XKujKjb0C
What does caterpie mean when she said “ it’s not me you’ve been afraid of”?
I wonder what blastoise voice would be if wartortle is a war general
7:57 i never realised how messed up Bullbasaur wearing pablo's head was until i saw this
I LOVE THIS IM SO GLAD ITS BACK
Episode 11 Episode 11 Episode 11 episode 11
Are you sure wartortle is not kratos?
MAKE EPISODE 11 QUICKER PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was a misdirect. The whole time we thought the story was about Charmander’s journey, but it was really about Squirtle’s journey to stand up for himself and be his own mon. We see for the first time him really truly doing something that isn’t for someone else (charmander, his trainer, caterpie, etc.) Everything that’s happened since episode one has culminated right here. Unreal and fantastic work! Next two Eps are gonna be GAS 🔥
WHAT HAOPEND TO CHARMNDERRR, I THOUGHT HE WAS COMING BACK
Damn squirtle has better character development than captain marvel
Please make charmander alive again
I wished ther was more I need to know what happened next!!!!!!!
Yay! After two years... This got really dark and depressing. Didn't get the chuckles like with the gastly and missing number and mewtwo.
Next episode will come next year right?
2 years ago was the last episode
Whew! Amazing!
Sad to know charmander would have never known how powerful squirtel would have become
I’m so happy we got to see another episode
This is by far the best episode. Its plot is on another level, perfectly attractive storyline and animation, lovely!
But to think that it would be Squirtle who will finish this journey is just surprising
OMG I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG :D
27:21 NaviBoii16, I respect you
What an episode, see you in 2023 for the next one
Its scary to think that there are two more left
Big Bibby is a whole mood
After years it’s finally out!!!!
Aw man charmander is *dead*
Wartortle looked a bit like herobrine
These videos are getting better and better
7:57 the most shocking part for me
When I see charmand  the hall
2 more eps I remember years ago when I found this I was like 7
FINALLY
Theres still two episodes left we can still see bulbasaur if hes not dead or if hes even still a bulbasaur
10 years later and they still haven’t evolved…. Sounds like if Ash where a Pokémon
And another 2 years for ep 11
I have been waiting sooooo long but I was kinda sad because of Squirtle being alone now
Damn man I can't wait for the next episode
Time to wait one more year
unironically some of the best character development i've ever seen
Am i dead?
Man
Omg
so basically this is pokémon animal farm lol
Cant wait for season 2!!!!!!
i don't know why this turned into god of war but i'm all for it!!!!!! and edatlin........ good
Over all the amount of work put into this was amazing! It paid off.  I'm just a lonely person but I also lost total interest the moment charmander was dead, although wartortle is my fav of them). Great work wish yall the best of luck.
this is fking epic!
Fearow is sure a bird :)
Yay my fave series  is back this is the best can't wait for ep 11 and 12
I recognized immediately that Squirtle was projecting his feelings about Charmander onto Chimchar, all because he referred to Chimchar as "Char", as in *Char*mander. Very clever!
Better than any other episode
Did anyone noticed that the “10 years later” is a reference to how Red and Green(Kanto) came out in 1996 and Diamond and Pearl(Sinnoh) came out 2006, both in japan
What an episode. I’m blown away by everything I felt. By far the best episode in the series. 👍🏻
Somebody hit puberty late
i hate your videos
Are we gonna have time traveal maybe arceus can help or mega Blastoise will become the new god?
This is an amazing series and the wait is worth it
:,)
Bro its finally out after so long congrats bro
Bulbasaur
Warturtal remineds me of Batman all so crude of the flash back of charmander
Finally after all these years EPISODE 10
Next episode please
I hope I'm wrong but, It would be funny if the pokemon god turns out to be Bulbasaur
I want those talking tree’s as my best friends
DAMN IT YOU BEAVERS!
YESSS
Ye that was it
But most importantly anybody have any theories on what this is? 12:49
I miss charmander
Boring as shit bro, can't believe I have been waiting for more than 2 years constantly checking this account just to find this bullshit episode.
Clicking this episode I did not expect it to hit this hard, the sudden deep emotional impact and dark turn on Squirtle's story is just amazing. This is an award winning film
How long will we have to wait for part 11 now ...
AMAZING
Shit…like , didn’t expect this at all , this episode is nothing like the others , cant believe charmander is actually dead , bulbasaur preferred to be used as food and squirtle just passed 10 years trying to make a team again but this time make things right  , idk how to feel , 9 episodes of watching the adventures of them 3 and now… , every dead was kinda comic before , but now… makes you realize how cruel pokemon world really is if it wasn’t for kids , I also wonder what happened with mewtwo , he asked chafmander and bulbasaur to look for him after they found squirtle , that never happened , what’s next , and the saddest thing is I know I won’t get answers at least in 2 years
Five minutes in, and Turtwig already reminds me of Gaty from BFB.
Wow, that was awesome
Yooo and ma man caterpie like going crazy
Yooo i mised starter squad sooooo much
This was a amazing episode great animation and worth the wait great job!
LETS GO WARTORTLE I LOVE THIS SERIES I WILL WAIT FOR NEXT EPISODE I WILL BE PATIENT
Hey when was this?
This… this genuinely hurts to watch. After Charmander died, he just shut down. Grew numb to everything he did afterwards. And blamed it on those around him. He went through so much shit, and it broke him.
It's here!!!!
Whoever wrote the score for this thing did an amazing job.
Omg it's out 😮😮
So technically this all started in 2011?
Is there going to be a episode 11?
when I saw 10 years later I actually thought we would see a fully evolve charmander into charizard...He evolved in Hatmander...Dammit
woaw I cant believe it is here, I had already given up hope. I already had my rope attached to the ceiling.
The story are really sad. I think what Wartortle want is to return to 10 years ago
The path of enlightenment is never paved, but remains to be paved.  Rock on Wartle dude. Give em hell.
was thinking its all about charmender but squirtle was the main character all along/
I WAS WAITING 2 YEARS TO SEE A NEW EPISODE! AND NOW HERE IT IS!!!
really? nobody is talking about the death of the main character wow.
it was worth the wait
whait if the starter squad is done what will heppen next?
THEIR BACK!
Should have stay in 1st Generation only
Charmenderrrr!!!!! I hate this Caterpir
finally the new ep comes!!! do u know how many YEARS!!! i have been waiting!!??
Charmander was my favourite character and him getting killed after all this time makes me so mad but I can not juge
28 minutes felt like 4 minutes
So many memories I’m happy they finally finished it
Did anyone notice the glitch is still going on and fighting with Mewtwo
Finally dude u finished good job
Now wait again one year for next episode. Series end in 2 years
Oh god I just noticed charmanders head on the worm
I’m guessing that these so called "Pokémon gods” is Palkia, Dialga, Giratina, and Arceus. Especially since there in the Sinnoh region.
I am pissed they killed charmander
So basically what I got from this episode was that Charmander was killed (rip🙏🙏) Squirtle mentally broke and obeyed Caterpie to the end which included the following: - War engaged on Bird Clan (Fearow & Spearow) - Countless lives lost on both sides - The betrayals and deaths of lots of Caterpie who refused to fight for their leader  - The death of Whiskers (🙏I stan) - The final war which killed all Caterpie and all Fearow & Spearow - The release of Squirtle and depature of the leader Caterpie   *10 years later*  Squirtle is somewhat mentally recovered being remarkably lvl 98. He's had a new team for a while now and much has happened which include the following: - Char wants to fight for her own and get stronger so runs to the mountain. - Squirtle follows Char to the mountain with Stickle who ends up leaving after feeling used when Squirtle calls him Bulbasaur. - Squirtle goes up the mountain alone (trees don't count 😡😡)  - Squirtle finds Char dead (🙏) after fighting with the Tree God (he counts 😇) - Squirtle has flashbacks and takes responsibility for all the things he has killed which he then tells the Tree God that that's what they should do too.  - Squirtle Evolves into Wartortle after accepting the past. - Squirtle defeats the Tree God (hewaskindahottho🙏) - Squirtle goes up the mountain to fight the gods with his recently deceased friend on his shoulder.  Extraordinary Episode Shippiddge                                                                 timetowait2000000yearsforthenextone:D:D:D🙏
Omg it's here Edit: OG pokemon team gone rip ima miss charmander and babosour
Strongest SKULL BASH ever!
I miss charmander already :(
RIP
Amazing content!! :-) 😁😄
Plz release the ep 11 this year
I waited for this for soooo long...... absolutely worth every second
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
I would sacrifice my self if it meant both the chars would come back
wait, Charmander's quest is incomplete.......  SO THAT MEANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILERS???-   he goes up meets Arceus revives Chimpchar gets a wish for being disciplined and helping others revives Charmander  Charmander completes quest fin mewtwo
I’m really hoping charmander and bulbasour come back somehow this was the best episode ever
Wonderful animation and script. Glad to see this series' return. :D
when will be nex episode next year ?
I wish to see the revival of charmander and bulbasaur and a team to take down the caterpie
I want you to  know that I cry and this is one of my favortite shows
This obviously took a lot of work. It's a culmination of everything you have ever done in your life so far, but I can't help but notice that this is the 3d pokemon version of loss. You took a light hearted, comedic parody, albeit with some darker overtones, then shucked that for grief porn. The only thing it is a parody of now is itself.
its been year since I seen this series
FINALLY
Ed Atlin killed it here lol
Definitely worth the wait!
And if charmander never died yet show an episode of him evolving into charmeleon.
@Shippage you should have bulbasaur evolving into ivysaur in your next episode.
Literally.....I wait 2 YEARS FOR THIS MOMENT 🥺❤
I love how I'm currently seeing 2 🐢's on a journey up a mountain while squirtle  whines and complains on what he could of changed while Turtwig treats him as his alter ego 😂😂😂.
This is like basically a short movie the quality is insane. Visuals, direction, story beats, and writing. Its actually kind of impressive it was done in the timeframe it was, even if it seemed long. I remember starting this before ep 9 was done, and it seemed like a simple fan made parody. Then 9 escalated it to another level, and 10 even moreso.
Episode ten finally
After 2 years holy
I just realized that Charmander already become the hat of Caterpie,just like Pablo.
ITS HERE, FINALLY
Thank you for ep 10 love you💙❤💚💛💜
Finally it's been so long
Is that an Asura's Wrath reference I see
The real question is if mewtwo is still fighting missingo 10 years later
2 days or 1 days ago i saw its only 93k views….. now it have literally 1 million views
finally yay thaks for the ep i love ir
MORE
Finally
Been waiting years for this.
Finally.
Can't wait for Episode 11 in 2023
The legend is back
Squirtle when he evolved lvl is actually 94 so that the guardian couldnt get a chance
More please.
Nooooooooooooo! Not charmander! 🔥 🔥 🔥  Dang this episode hit the feels on all cylinders.  Great job man! 🤙🏽
Funny how I started out kinda rooting for the caterpie just to end up rooting against it.
Let’s just hope squirtle which is lvl 98 doesn’t lose to some random lvl 5 pokemon
Jesus christ I thought you were dead
I had given up hope, but that was enjoyable. I don't know when the next episoe will be, so I guess I'll just take it for what it is.
I mean, it's clear our water starter friend is going to use Dialga to go back in time, but damn, topical with the games coming out, really gives us an episode to FEEL those consequences, so I don't think it'll feel like a cop out. Really good stuff bro, you've come such a long damn way from Melee abridging skits.
I thought this series was dead I’m glad it’s back is charmander dead?
Okay, first it was a comedy about power-hungry, homicidal maniacs, now it's trying to be profound about cycles of violence and the responsibilities and denials that come with it. You people at Shippiddge have plans, I'm kinda scared of you now
Bro finally I’ve been waiting for like 2 years
Great episode. See you guys again in two year
Charmander should have stayed alive and Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander should have stuck together, this just seemed like a spin off, perhaps in the future they will come back together somehow
Alright, see u in another decade when New episode is uploaded, this one was a good one tho worth to wait :D
when is episode 11 coming
Yoooooo what the fuck!!!
Charmander actually died :'(
This was phenomenal
F
Now to wait another 2 years for an episode
Miss you
I waited for so long and at the end charmander is dead! WTF IS THIS!
Amazing content
Its been 765 days since the last episode now I'm fully comeplete now I can rest now
Yay
Now imagine watching this series once ever couple months dreaming, just wondering if another episode will come out then waking up for school then accidentally opening YouTube and seeing this 😍
so Wartortle is basically Kratos, neat
Me discovering a level 98 starter  Me fighting it with my level 16 starter
Damn i love this series im pretty sad 2 mor ep this series gonna end :(
12:50 is this an Easter egg ?
FINALLY I WAITED AN ENTIRE YEAR FOR THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH YESS
Rip
How did I not notice that the Caterpie Leader was wearing Charmander's head during the flashbacks? Must have really hurt for Squirtle to look at them, knowing that it was his own fault that Caterpie decided to kill Charmander instead of putting him away in a pokeball forever.  Squirtle really changed after learning that his choices should be his own and not for anybody else, him turning into Wartortle was the best thing I've seen.
This episode is amazing and grim like holy
This episode is amazing and grim like holy
Cant wait till episode 11 the finale to come out in like 5 years
Its finally here! I have to wtch past few ep again tho, forgot wt had happened 😅
What a crazy awesome story of Squirtle and his journey
The legend returns
Finally it has come after waiting for a year the episode has come....
Bro this episode is lowkey grim asf
Poor charmander
God Wartortle
Hey shippedge make a episode where charmander is a ghost and meets wartortle
Yesss
So wartortle is gonna kill god (arceus), well I think he can since he’s currently lv99 and Arceus is always met at lv 70 or 80
I'm so damn happy starter squad is back and squirtle is a badass now! Also RIP Charmander hopefully these gods can like revive him or somethin
It's pretty sad that this series is light years better than the last twenty years of the actual pokemon anime at least. Call me crazy, but it almost seemed like Whiskers was about to say that Leonard was her husband or something like that. Definitely more going on there than we see. Also I'm very curious to know what Bulbasaur's ultimate fate was. Squirtle says that he had a relatively happy ending compared to him and Charmander. I would like some more detail on what happened to him, and Whiskers for that matter. Also looking forward to seeing what will happen at the summit. One things for sure, it's going to get even crazier from here.
Alternative reality: Squirtle saves Charmander from being killed by the Caterpie leader, gathering the team, evolving and becoming the best
The episode that everyone waits
YES FINALLY TY FOR MAKING EPISODE 10!!
Now we gotta wait another year for awesomeness
Sorry I shouldn’t have asked that but this episode was amazing
Yes finally it has arrived yessss
FINALLY
Will we ever find out what happens next?
Wait so i'm never gonna met char and bub again?
This Is very controversial...
12:51 anyone else noticed mewtwo
Also also I liked the god of war reference
Also I’m still expecting a starter squad game maybe the first 9 episodes could be a game
absolutely amasing!
I miss charmander. Rip
Anyone else found it ironicly hilarious charmander was made into a hat for caterpie after he was killed.  That and mewtwo was still fighting misingo
he sounds cool
Looks like this turtle has that raid boss power
Poor turtwig
I thought charmander was the main guy + he was my favorite but godamn
More bibey?
Fun fact: The word "Believe" is not only a magic word,but also a trigger word. LMAO
Now my question is what's gonna happen with the Mewtwo storyline now that Charmander's dead since Mewtwo told him to meet him in Cerulean Cave
FINALLY
Time to wait for 2024 yeahh lest go!
Finally
Finallyyyyyy feels like I've waited literal years for this
After years the generations have passed and the reins are over to squirtle but... did charmander really die?
HOLY FUCKING SHIT ITS FINALLY HERE Edit: Oh my god
I like how Squirtle also proboably doesn't know Chimchars name and just calls him Char like Charmander.
cmon man not charmender he was my favorite  why him man fuck squrtil he lsent to a worm insted of saivn a god damn dragon  and they started getting along too
Disappointed with Squirtle, he let Charmander die and didn't even learn his lesson to cherish his friends, can't even remember Turtwig's name damn!
Wow it really did took 10 years later
R.I.P. Charmander 😢
Finally
I have been waiting for half a year its such a sprize that it's finnaly here
Finally!! I missed this 2 days ago
Pls make ep 11 fast
Nobody: Me: *being excited for next episode because maybe bulbasaur will show up*
if he's that powerful as wartortle how strong will he be as blastoise
This is SO badass!! Nothing like I was expecting. So much thought went into this episode, no one could have predicted this. I just hope that Charmander doesn't get revived in some way now. It's absolutely insane that they killed him off.
Whats the music at the end 24:24
He is kratostortle now
Starter Squad has lore! This is amazing work!! 😂
Technoblade Chimchar
FINALLY AFTER YEARS!
Now we only need to wait a few more decades until the next episode
*Time to wait another year like I did last two years ago lol. sad how time flew that fast  ._.*
Squirtle look more tired and darker blue than normal
YES ITS ABOUT TIME.  Also when is number 11 coming out?
CHARMANDERS DED!!!!!!!!😤😭😭😢
Legend back
We won’t see chamender again😭😢
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ITS FINALLY OUT LETS GOOOOOO
I think hes going to ask for Chimchar back, Charmander , and Bulbasaur. I don't like Squirtle's voice any more because he sounds like a man who's smoked for 30 years
HAZZA! Thank you Shippiddge for all the great content! Love what you do. Prediction: I think (Squirtle) is going to demand Dialga and Palkia to change history and have Charmander be the one picked at the beginning of the series. That way, Charmander wouldn't feel the rejection and go out on his own eventually causing all this destruction. Just my foreshadowing :)
Squrtal evolved yes
Edatlin as the Snovers was the best part! XD
Dude. i appreciate all that you and the team have done for this. So long of a wait but so satisfying to see that things are going well! :D
WHEN DID THIS SHOW STOP BEING FUNNY!?
When a team collapse everyone will
Bro it took over 1 year to make sheesh
finally
The storytelling and expressions are amazing! Everyone on the team did really great. I was consistently on the edge of my seat in anticipation. Thank you for this masterpiece, I can't wait for what's to come.
Haha u have chosen death wow from the meme
Scary video:D
The wait was worth it
Woah
took you long enough
Aw man Charmander died this got 50% less entertaining
Please make ep 11 soon, please
I wonder if the chapter after is gonna be 45 minutes and the last is gonna be 1 hour
I miss this series it was a good series
Omg you're back!!!!
Turtwig is cool hes my first starter
What happend to charmander and bulblasaur?
Finally
Finally the next episode
cant wait to wait another 2 years
LETS GOOO EPISODE 10
I like charmander but but charmander is dead now
Time to wait for another 2 year for another episode😃😃
Amazing episode To sad that charmander died
only now i understand why hes at lvl 98 so he can evolve to blastoise :3
YES YES THIS IS WHAT I CAME FOR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Edit:Charmander……died?
when will they evolve :((
Where is episode 11
its out babyy!!
BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME! THEY DO!
Now we have to wait another year just for another ep 😭😢🤯
FINALLY AFTER LIKE WHAT 2 YEARS?!  Edit: Sorry if this came off as rude im just glad this is finally out
7:26 勝利(syo-ri) = Victory
#11 on trending
charmander dead?!?!?! im now sad
That moment when caterpie realised.
it is finally here!!
I’ve been waiting 2 years for an new episode 😂
I sell the devolution sprays
8:14 "What about Bulbasaur?" "-He didn't wanna leave, I think he got the happiest ending out of all of us" Ok, but what does that *mean?* if he didn't wanna leave then why isn't he there with squirtle?
I was rooting for the bidoofs the whole time
so...is charmander coming back or is he dead for good or what?
There are still 2 episodes left, so I'm betting he's gonna take approximately 11 years
Noooooo Charmander died
Great ep 10, obviously not worth the 2 year wait but not saying it’s bad in any way, the best episode I’ve watched by far in fact
That was great but also can’t wait for  when the next episode comes out in 2 years
RIP Chimchar
I think snover is my new favourite pokemon
what about charmander, did charmander really die :(
Omg
Omg
omg... its finally out
Does charmander really die ???
*THIS TOOK WAY TO FUCKING LONG BUT ITS WORTH IT!*
Glad to see this series still has life  and so does Shipp
More😡😡😡😡
We gotta wait another year sadly
Can i make video for indian audience i explain in hindi and also give link your in description 😅
Every video had charmander in the thumbnail until now.
I completely forgot about this long awaited series weird it's already been 2 years since the last episode
Let's wait another year yay
I need that ending theme as a separate video tbh it’s fire
Oh my God is the movie so long
I loved this Shippiddge Worth  The wait
I’ve waited years for this. Ah yes.
10 years passed, I'm gonna assume a War occured in Kanto between literally everything in the background in every flashback has had a war-like background.
It's finnaly here. What a legend.
OML I HAVE WAITED SO LONG I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T EVER POST AGAIN XD
I would die for any one of those Snover, they are literally the best and I couldn't love them any more than I already do. Also, the person who voice acted them did an amazing job, the voice was 90% of the entire appeal.
Cool
There's been so long
Finally
What happened to charmander and balbasaur
Why abomasnow rember me of a genshin charter
1:37 *when the bidoof is sus*
Well it’s like leaving the border of North Korea you just can’t, you get killed 13:28
So finally you made it @shippidge
this is just depressing, we dont even know what bulbasaur is doing, charmander is just dead, and the little turtle we known that known how to fix the things now is just traumatized and sad every second of the little time it has on his life, this is impacting and such a good animation but, this just feels sad in every way.
I wonder if bulbasaur will evolve on 11 and on 12 they will come back and evolve
squirtle bout to become squirtos and kill the gods
Fun fact, this is the only episode where Charmander is not in the thumbnail.
Spoiler Warning!!!  I really wonder if the death and destruction spread by the Caterpie will tie into anything related to Missing No. and Mewtwo. Or, if Wartortle will ever meet Mewtwo.
Are you going to take another 2 years to release another episode?
This came outta no where lol
what happened to piplup
Finally it’s here this is a INSANE good series!
I saw mewtwo fight MiSSiNgNO in this time stamp 12:51
I have been waiting for such a long time!!!
Finally less go
I watched this back then and finally ep 10 came
charmander
LES GO FINALLY
Damn this is like a movie
charmander 😭
Wow
Every ep takes years to make
charmander might return as gastly
Huh so since Charmander is dead I guess this is season 2???
After 1 year there is episode 10
Oh my god it’s my childhood video!!
I wish Charmander did not die. When I saw his head I had to pause and cry. R.I.P my precious little Pokémon but, congrats on the 10th episode! This was really good despite seeing my favourite Pokémon dead.. I also never thought that Squirtle would evolve and the bulbasaur wanted to stay. (I thought he might have wanted to go back to his friend(s)?)
HE DID IT
Now lets wait for another decade
What an episode
I thought abomamasnow let chimchar pass cause he/she is gonna let him/her through cause abomamsnow know chimchar is a fire type which is strong at ice typer
I don't know how I feel about just a time skip. It's okay? But it doesn't really make much sense in my eyes.
Like = rip for charmander
I hope we get see bulbasaur again
Can I get more screaming Golbat and him cutting people off by screaming please💖
Rip for charmander
I needed this you really gave us a true gift thank you☺️ and just before Christmas you dog!
I wish charmander survives PLS
Finally
I respect actually going through with offing charmander. The emotion and comedy are both on point. Awesome job as always! To you and your team.
12:51 nice easteregg
Wow your doing an amazing job it should be in Netflix or something else
WOOOOOOOO
Well this was something. Firstly I want to say congrats on finally getting the episode done, you've clearly put a lot o effort into it.  I have a bit of criticism though. Throughout the series we've been following the adventures of Squirtle, Charmander and Bulbasaur. Seeing how they try to get stronger, growing closer as friends and helping each other. Sure they butted heads but no friendship is perfect. Also the humor was top notch in many of the episodes. Here though..... it feels like a different story all together .  Charmander was kinda the main focus of the series and we saw how he developed to value his friends and learned empathy. He was busy having character development. But..... now he's just dead...... like.... why? That means all his character development was wasted and served no real purpose in the grand scheme of things. That's severely disappointing.  Like I said this doesn't feel like the same series. The premise and theme of it changed completely. What once was a fun series of misadventures with the starters, is now a post war story. I'm sorry I'm not onboard with that.  I'm still gonna see what you have planned for this series but, honestly I'm very hesitant. Not because of how dark this series has become, but because of the story structure and change of the overall premise .   I still wish you luck though.
THE RETURNNNNNNN
This is best we need all win in new episode new episode 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
Yessir
The fuck did I stumble upon?
yay finaly
I think mewtwo switched him for an other charmander
I have the feeling that ep 11 is gonna show what happened to Bulbasaur
Pls make wartortle partner up witha poison type
please realeae ep. 11 and 12 too
Aww man now we have to wait 2 more years
I love pokemon
I wanted charmander to survive
Love how char actually died in the same way the first caterpie did. And it was his first murder too! As well as the first for Leader, of many others that just led to ruin. What goes around really comes around
It’s a real shame charmander died and bulbasaur stayed
Loved this but honestly I kinda wish just straight up evolved into blastoist
It’s out
this was REALLY deep
No one gonna talk about How great was Snovers?
NOT HIS AREA!!
HE..HE RETURNED THE MAN THE LEGEN- and hes gone
Woah, the animations, the modella, the enviorments, the voices...so good..i Imagine the months behind this
First of, how are there dislikes ? Second of, how are there so many ? Third of, why are there so few likes ? Fourth of, all those whose dislikes should end their disgusting lives !
Lol waited so long
This is so epic, I'm looking forward to the next episode! Great work!
This series still has the same theme
Did charmander dies?
Hes like batman
This is absolutely worth the wait
im assuming we only have to wait 1 year this time? hopefully not more than 2
Cool as hell
Finally It is back
Why is the writing for this so good
FINALLY EPISODE 10
I love the details with Squirtle Squirtle looks a lot more dull, there are scratches on his shell Also Squirtle is now a war veteran
This legendary video is on trending
Are we going to ignore mewtwo still fighting missingno? 0:12:50
Why charmander is dead like w the #### are you serious are you kidding me w the ############# carmaker is the best come on let him come again please
imo episode 9 was WAYYYYYYYYY better (not saying this was bad but this left like 57 not answered)
There's one more level to go for squirtle, one more evolution...
13:30was that a bullet?
Next part please 🙏🙏😭😭😭😭
Such a well made episode. Hopefully 11 is soon
So..... When are we expecting another? 😅
I recognized *immediately* that Squirtle was projecting his feelings about Charmander onto Chimchar, all because he referred to Chimchar as "Char", as in *Char*mander. Very clever!
Can't believe Charmandar died. He is my favourite Pokemon I was hoping that all of this was a dream Squirtle is seeing
Time to wait another 2 years i hope not
I find it weird that so many people are like ... upset at charmander's death. My only complaint is that the murder happy psychopath didn't die sooner, literally every terrible thing going on in the world is his fault and he never showed the slightest bit of care or remorse. Even wanting to rescue squirtle was just for his own selfish reasons of needing squirtle's advice, as the only strait man on the team who knew what was going on. Chimchar's death meanwhile was just funny. Soooo very happy that turtwig did the rational thing and just walked away.
Omg let’s go
What about ep 11
predication. charmander did actually die but mewtwo OR the glitch will reset his death or the whole universe idk its just a guess lol
Hey he is back
The return of the king
Yes finally
Lol
Going full Kratos
I'm confused is charmander really still dead? I know that leader caterpie was wearing his head as a hat, but was that really him?
Omg ITS HERE
one year later
Now what he oveld into blastois and kill chamador
it will take the next episode 50 years
finally its here
I hate this,i forgot that it was to be continued when caterpilla was gonna kill charmander,but i thougt squirtle was gonna save him or charmander will dodge or attack,now my favourite characther is dead😭😭😭,still i need to finish the series cause this was my childhood
Finally. It’s out!!
Damn everything about this episode is sad
YOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIOOOOSOAOSOWOOOOOOOOOEWOWOWOOOOOOOOOOOAOAOAOAOOOOOOOOOO EPISODE 10000000. EPISDOED 10 BABY LETS GOOOOO
WORTH THE WAIT!
Did bulbusour and charmander die?
FINNALLY!!!!!!
Not where I expected this story to go
But i gues i enjoind the episode but i like the og episodes more
Thank you!
Honestly squirtle deserves this
This is like a sequal of the first 9  Its like a movie Wow
Yes but where is char and Bulbasaur
Scew the stupid fire monkey and turtwig
For over 2 years I have waited, and this is what I come back to. I must say, I am impressed, and kinda shocked.  I loved the visuals as well. Very  nicely done. Maybe the story telling coulda used a bit more work, but that was actually pretty cool with the flashbacks and all that, and Snow. Snow was a freaking beast.That was freaking awesome. Please keep up the good work. I can't wait to see the final two episodes.
I am really sad that charmander died  and I feel bad for squirtle I just cried.This series is awesome , awesome work by the team and everyone supporting them ❤️
Why did you make charmander and bubasaur not be in the series over all kill charmander??? Why 😭
Turtle travels up a mountain to kill the gods holding a monkey
I’m happy when watching your video💕 Have a nice time💕🌼🌺🌸☘️🌿🌾🌴☘️🌿🌴🌾🇳🇴
we have ben blest
Well Time to wait 10 year for the next episode
BUT WE STILL NEED ONE MORE
I would kindly ask you to bring Charmander back.
Laughed my ass off when he said  move at first 🤣
THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN WAITINGNFOR SO LOOOONG
I cant believe this was told by an absmol pokemon thing
Please make part 11 pleaseèeeeeeeeeeeeee
My favorite part was “WHAT THE FU- *EXPLODES*
cant wait til ep11
I wish Charmander could see how much of a bad ass Squirtle is now and what he's like as Wartortle
"JUST TELL ME THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE THIS RIGHT" Squirtle: There's a way to make this right.
Holy shit. I honestly forgot about this
top 1 ultimate beings  BLUE SHELL MAN GUY
I'm wagering the evolutions are more akin to the Digimon anime with more permanence, but I can't help but calculate a little bit of the stats. Abomasnow is at a minimum level 40 (unless he straight up breaks the rules of level evolving), but couldn't do much to OHKO the level 98 Squirtle even using his most effective attack, Wood Hammer (which I'm assuming he was using) and could only take Wartortle faster than him around level 60 - less if he actually Mega evolved or was a Dynamax. Wartortle now has one more level and one more evolution, then maybe his Mega or Gigantimax form - both which can be done without a trainer but usually are shown with one in the main game. If Blastoise gets Aura Sphere and Ice Beam, the Sinnoh legendaries and even the mythicals will be torn to shreds, otherwise it all depends on their levels.
Finally
Two more years
#BringBackCharmanderAndBulbasaur
This man is philosophically based! What an amazing series! And the updated visuals are also a treat. Real great episode!
Did Squirtle turn into super sayin
Return of the king
I was waiting for this episode for a long time 🥳🥳🥳
16:11 dialga and palkia are there
He he die but what happened after he got stap
where is charmander and bulbasaur
Yeeaaaa boy
Make it fast
Make it fast
Make them faster
I love the voice change Squirtle/Wartortle gets. That was fun. Miss his og voice, but also I like that he seems like in a god tier mode, being a lvl 98/99??? Wartortle now.(I was expecting him to evo into Blastois too, given his high lvl. Maybe that'll happen next ep???) This was so good. I miss Charmander tho, but I do like this story telling so far, and I can't wait for the next. Thanks to everyone that worked on it, I love this series so much!
Omgggggg
pls make more episodes sooooon
Whyyyyy did charmander had to die??? I only watch this series because of charmander ...
This little sparkle of hope that Charmander actually surivive just gone ;< R.I.P Charmander
its finally here..
Its finally released... YES
FINALLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYY
FINALLY YESSSSSSSSS
"grandpa, so how did the pokegod war start?" "it all started with red who chose squirtle over charmander"
How long till ep 11
It’s about time
The man Ive been waiting for years finally u uploaded
I was very much not expecting this to be episode 10, and this is magnificently done. I cannot wait for episode 11 and 12 for the series finale
waiting for next epi
I want charmender back
I make pokemon AMV'S
SMASHED expectations, Thank you!!
I thought that someone would save charmander but he died
THAT WAS FUCKING EPIC
OMG YESSSS
Wait what happens if wartortle turns into blastoise
When the world needed him most HE IS BACK!
This this gives my nostalgic memories finally a new episode
It took so long, but it was worth it
make the next one faster
Aaaand the wait starts again. cool video I see why I took so long
flinnalyyyyyyyyyy lets goooo sheshhh
Finally
This is actually messed up for some reason and I think it's because of charmander or that stupid caterpie
OMG
I’ve waiting months for this keep up the work and this is not my iPad
Caterpie killed charmander i will kill every caterpie
Charmander's death was unexpected.
One million views already. Deserved. This is my favorite web series 🤧❤️
Im going to kill every caterpie i encounter
LETS GO EP 10
It’s back after 2 years it’s back I feel so happy
I came to find how Charmander escaped. His death was the most emotional any animation has ever made me. I both love and hate you at the same time for that. He was a character that I really connected with for some reason and I wish he never died. Please, I hope you have a plan to bring him back.
squirtle have ultra instinct
I’m glad to see this I’ve been re watching the episodes over and over again it’s nice to see a new episode
Where is my charmander (｡ŏ﹏ŏ)
holy water gun, the waiting is finally over
"God of Gods, *Creators* of *TIME* and *SPACE*" that's literally Dialga and Palkia, he's gonna convince those two, to send him back in time, to the place, just moments before he attacks Charmander, or just after, and stop Caterpie. Charmander, still has that missingno issue to deal with, that Mewtwo was still fighting. I don't think he's just gonna let Charmander die and stay dead.
Does anyone else hear that Fearow making bird sounds cause I can't really tell.
PlsEp11
I think when you make the next video the Pokemon God it's going to be Mewtwo I want Wartortle Seas she's the Pokemon God he gets super mad then he defeated the Pokemon God then that make all the Pokemon back from the dead and then everything will be back to normal Pokemon going to still talk the end
See you guys in 2 years
Yes its finally here!
now we have to wait 2 years again
Ok know we wait for a year to a next episode;-;
That caterpie is the most evil caterpie ever XD
Bruh i cant wait for more episodes
ALL THIS YEAR AND I THOUGHT THIS YOUTUBE WAS DEAD OH MAN I WAS SO WRONG
Damn, this got heavy. I was duped into caring... Good job, I miss Charmander
Squirtle went full-on *God of War* --tortle.
This was an amazing episode! Dark with it's funny moments. Definitely will stick with me for some time. Great work and I'm looking forward to the next two! I predict a sweet and sour ending.
It took 1year and it finally released
We went from the adventures of a selfish lizard and a reasonable turtle (and a plant frog) to charmander dying and squirtle becoming an anime protagonist
This was fantastic, I am heavily shocked that charmander was murder as he was actually getting some character development. I would like to know what happened to bulbasour and whiskers. Will there be an episode eleven because this is fantastic.
Please make charmender alive
LET'S GOOOOOOO IT'S BEEN FOREVERRRRRRR 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
God of war vibes right here
please don't take a 3 year hiadus again i missed you
This is seriously enganging content.. You're super talented 🔥
If Charmander doesn't get revived soon I'm gonna cry.
OMG YES
NP FUCKING WAY
After 1 year
I'm surprised that this series is able to hit emotional and comedic beats after this long of a run time. It's unironically one of the best things I've ever watched
Waw....                             Welp i guess we gonna wait some more year
ive been waiting for like 10 years XDDDDD
FINALLY WAITING FOR YEARS! TY SO MUCH!
Episode 11 when
And I thought charmander was annoying, chimchar is even worse I hope he stay dead. 😂
😀😀😀😀
I’ve been eating long an uth
Charmander died :(
Where did charmander and bulbasaur go
THAT WAS IT-
The legend has returned
Bro why did it have to go 10 years It went from funny adventures to squirtell all alone Its sad that charmander died  By 2026 this.series would end😂😭😢
Did Anyone see that scene at 12:49. What is mewtwo versing? a missingno???
finally ep 10
This was epic
FINALLY BOYS ITS OUT
This is insane. It’s been 8 years! Can’t wait to see how it all ends!
Where is Charmander?
Maybe the glitch that Mewtwo's fighting is Squitle/Wartortle trying to go back and save Charmander.
yeah yeah Yeah 5 years baby
Impossible.
Maybe one day,he found bulbasuar that has evolve into venusaur
I shouldnt have paid the episodes
Wartortle is actually my all Time favourite, it's brutal to see him like that tbh
First, I believed you would deliver for the tenth time in a row and I placed my faith very wisely. Second, I felt emotional when my suspicions of Charmander being dead were confirmed. Third, Caterpie always seemed like the real villain of the series to me. Fourth, the music kicks ass and Castlevania III came to mind during the fight between Wartortle and Abomasnow. Fifth, Wartortle is easily and undeniably my favourite out of Squirtle, Wartortle and Blastoise so I was extremely happy to see Blue Shell Man Guy evolve. Sixth, the animation is better than it has ever been during the eight years that the show has been running for so far. Seventh, the storytelling is extremely excellent and I am always excited to see what comes next. Eighth, I shall sign up on Patreon to support you and your squad as best I can here in Canada. Ninth, my favourite Pokémon is Delphox. And tenth, most importantly: Thank you for entertaining me with a series that I have followed passionately since it first began. I was thirteen going on fourteen back when it began and I have only Loved the series more and more with every rewatch. Thank you for everything so far, Pierce. I am looking forward to all that is to come, along with the countless rewatches that me and my wife will witness.
You had one job
LETS GOOO EPISODE 10 IS HERE
Me:a new episode is probably going to be soon  5 years later Me:WHAT THE HECK WHY DID THEY TAKE SO LONG
I like that we get to see another momentary battle between Mewtwo and the glitch-beast at 12:50. Bringing that back after all this time. I wonder if Bulbasaur told Squirtle about Mewtwo?
Finally!
Props to Dreux Ferraro Jr. for his performance and those behind the music
The Pokemon version of kratos
Oh…my…god…it is finally here…episode 10…if you were waiting for this…youre a legend
Finally after 2 years
ITS BACK
It's back!!!!
Finally…
Once Wartortle asks the pokemon godsthe question we've all been waiting for he said something
There is a reason this takes place in the region where Dialga resides. There is too much left unfinished from 10 years ago. If Squirtle (Wartortle now) goes back to the day charmander dies, he can prevent the death of charmander, everyone in the war, and chimchar.
Finally
When wartortle said "something", I felt it.
I miss charmander :(
Nooo why charmander died🥺😢😭 Fuck man But... 2 more episodes left...
pls upload ep 11
who would it be a charmander who maybe got away or a caterpie maybe some other killer pokemon
IT'S HERE IT'S HERE IT'S HERE IT'S HERE
Guys hear me out: It’s not Arceus up there, but a Ditto.
Squirtle's evolved and he's ready to kill god(s) !
I just realized something, Mewtwo waswaiting for Charmander amd Bulbasaur to meet him in Cerulean Cave.
Holy s... It was amazing
finally :D
kinda wanted to see charmander evolve into charzard ...... maybe in the future episodes, fingers crossed
This speaks to me in ways I don't understand  yet. I think it's because  I feel like squirtel/wartortle I watch this everyday all I can say is thank you so much
10 years? Wait...  Pokemon Red & Green Release Date (JP): February 27, 1996. Pokemon Diamond & Pearl Release Date (JP): September 28, 2006.  Damn that's on point.
When video came out I sud
Snover: What are you going to ask? Wartortle : ..... Something. Me: nice
Those snovers made the wait so worth it
squirtle more like super saiyan god
Soooo charmander died
LETS GOOOOOOO
I WISH CHARAMANDER WAS STILL ALIVE SO HE COULD EVOLE TO CHARAMELEON AND CHARIZARD
Finnaly
Worth the wait
Are you using vpn
Ok i’m in love this series. The wait was worth it.
10
lesss go episode 10
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG OMG
Omg I wanna see more please make more!
questions what did Caterpie realize about Squirtle and who is he afraid of and why does he pity whoever takes control of Squirtle next ? also how did Squirtle make it to Sinnoh where I assume that's where this takes place (maybe surf?) and I'm guessing there was the first meeting between Chimchar, Turtwig and Squirtle but then what had happened to Piplup ?
Wow you guys really take a year to create the episode 0
OMG finally
Omg!! Sinnoh yes!!! Yes yes!!!! I live this please more Sinnoh!!!
If I am not wrong, this is the last episode, right?
Finally I part 10 it been forever and I think it was worth the wait
How is the animation better and worse at the same time
10 eps 10 years
Another 2 years until we get another episode… totally worth it though 😭
finally came out
i cant wait for the next episode. hope it comes out quick
Yes its back!
Upload episode fast plz
Next Episode - Dialga or Palkia?
wtf
OMG THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUED ITTTT OMGOMH
God of war scale battle
It doesn't make sense to me that, Wartortle has a deep evil voice, andhe's not even Blastoise yet, despite Mega Blastoise that will be a whole different story *And I don't wanna be that type of guy, but like if Squirtle is level 98 why didn't he evolve into Blastoise instantly
They actually killed off charmander?!?!?!?😱
What’s the ending song? :)
When is the next one coming out
Charmander deserved it.
Ok, see you next year...
God damn how many years has it been? I totally forgot about this!
So wait, did bulbasaur just get sucked dry by the caterpies then?
“What are you going to ask?”         *Something*
I can’t shake off the feeling this is gonna connect to how the mystery dungeon came to be
Impossible, isn’t bidoof the most powerful Pokémon?
pls  make Charmander back i like him:(
Oh my god this is amazing as heck
FINNALY
yay! this has updated! congratulations! I find it interesting how squirtle was trying to prevent chimpchar from the same thing that happened to charmander and that he was using an everstone.
I've been waiting so long
Worth the wait. I got Persona 5 vibes from Squirtle evolving. The writing for Squirtle... well, Wartortle now, is amazing. Although I'm a bit upset that Bulbasaur didn't appear again. Nice work, Shipp.
When the ads are placed right before the flashback
It here vfdfhsdgvrctnjmgfesevumknw no way
Please no one year gap I love these
I am curious though? does pokeballs brain washed pokemon? because the moment caterpie destroyed it. his mind became clear lol
finally we have waited for a year basically
Holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit
Charmander might not be dead. If you look closely at the hat it looks like it's cotton around the sides. Maybe he faked his death for some reason. In any case it's open ended enough that Charmander could return.  Great storytelling either way so far.
Yes finally! I’ve been waiting for this for so long haha!
I feel like he's gonna get to the top and somehow get dialga or arceus to rewind time
22:40 He be puttin’ the War in Wartortle!
It was sad that the 2 chars died
Finally it's here, next time please upload it faster.
ngl i thought the series was over
I'm upset about Charmander dying but holy shit that's not Wartortle that's WARtortle
So the Story of Missingno hasn't been explained? Thats a bit sad but hey this was a cool episode and I'm glad we got a new one!!
I found a Pokémon that can go back in time called Dialga the legendary tipe  so I think he’ll beat him and tell him to go back in time to save charmander
Where is charmander and bulbasaur
i am devastated at the fact that this is probably going to end on a cliffhanger
Part 11 pls
WOOO! Time to wait 2 years for episode 11 now!
I've been waiting for so long!! And it was absolutely worth the wait! Incredible job, and I cannot wait for the next episode!!!!!! This is why I love being a Pokémon fan.
Oh now I get the point of this series     Basically  squrtle was the mc and he was with the all the starter   So first it was gen 1 starter then now gen 2 and the next episode will be with gen 3
this story awesome but why squirtle didnt save charmander because charmander came to save him but squirtle didn't save himm
And now time to wait another year for the next episode. 😂
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain" Caterpie became what he hated
I think i am dumb to the point that i dont know if bulbasaur lived or its currently dead
Who's watching in 2027?
see you 2023
Always worth the wait
I want charmander to come back
23:00 I love how he goes, “WHAT THE FU-“
Pls pt 2 nooowwww
cool blue shell man guy is level 99
Way to subvert expectations in an emotional and satisfying way. I love Squirtle's growth. It's amazing how great your animation and story skills have grown over the years. Well done <3
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy shit it’s back
...
FINALLY
i have Blastoise
Why he(Squirtle) could have pushed caterpe
Wow. Absolutely love it.
When I saw the orange thing on Caterpie’s head, I was like: “When did Caterpie get a beanie?” And then I saw Charmander’s head 0-0
12:51 hey i know that guy
nice
12:50 mewtwo was there
Can someone tell me what the end credits song is cause I wanna listen to it
SHELL YEAH EP 10
rip charmander and chimchar
We're gonna see Venusaur or a dead bulbasur since the leader centipede messed up big time.
i thought charmander would turn into charizard but he got betrayed :(
ヒトカゲは本当に殺されたおまけに、10年経ってシンオウ地方まで旅立つとは…
Welcome back!
Man this has taken a huge turn , from killing green worms  to now reversing death.......i still remember watching the first episode in 2015 ....well done shippidge! you almost made me emotional
Warning spoilers don't read if you don't want be spoiled   Can i just go ahead and say that this man squirtle really let charmander die and end up being a puppet, a slave for caterpie and killing people out of loyalty and fear of death from caterpie and seeing they were wearing charmander's severed head like a hat, When the war happened the life around them was getting destroyed and after the war there was nothing left but the grey toxic carbon dioxide air in the sky the trees and grass without life and no one else but squirtle and caterpie up until caterpie released squirtle from his tie to them and left. I liked watching while i was in the 10th grade of high school i would like to make something like this in the future along with other animations on the way. With only two episodes left our journey through pokemon is about to come to an end so lets finish this together My dude!
24:20 Does anyone know the name of this music?
This is why you always pick Charmander
So wait they never went to fix the mess with mewtwo...oh man...
Poor Squirtle having Vietnam flashbacks i feel bad like omg this sad dude
im guessing by the flash backs, Squirtle had now gotten PTSD
God ten years? And caterpie has charmander head is charmander actually dead?
you fuckin kill it everytime
I screamed when this came out
wait why dosent squirlt eveolve
See, I can where this is going. Whoever is at the top is gonna send Squirtle back in time.
I think we will have to wait five years or the ending of the show I think it’ll take two years for the next episode than three years for the final episode
Finally
Not gonna lie, not a fan of Charmander being dead and Bulbasaur not being with the crew. I just feel like after all of the episodes of everyone being together was just thrown away. I'm still invested though, maybe Charmander will come back? Fingers crossed.
R.I.P Charmander and (Possibly), Bulbasaur character development
OMG, ITS FINALLY HERE!!!! THE MAN, THE LEGEND, HE'S COME THROUGH!!!!!!
He’s baaaaaack
That snover is hilarious 🤣
I will avenge charmander and kill any caterpie I see
After so long you did it I loved your vids please post more
Wow, I only ever saw the first episode a few years ago. Now it's a full blown God of War series. I'm so glad this was recommended to me. Amazing work! Can't wait to see the ending.
FINALLY
finally i have been waiting for this for a year
Hey man, good job
T-to long I have waited for this day. I am glad to know that there is going to be more episodes. I was hear when this all started. Ahh the nostalgia. Have a great one y'all.
Sooo, is no one gonna talk about Mewtwo? 12:50
Welp guess i have to wait for another 1-2 years, still though great job
do the nekst episod
I miss Charmander
UR GREAT I LOVE U UR SO COOL THIS TOOK U SO LONG BUT UR BACK AND UR EVEN BETTER I LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEE YOUUUUU I HOPE U GET SO MUCH LIKES AND SUB PLS GIVE IT TO HIM
Its been 85 years…
Holy hell hes been cooking a up a masterpiece! Epikness  Edit: prediction: he gets up to the top and Dialga is there, he sends warturtle back in time and he saves charmander, and either squirtel (at the time, also I spelled it wrong)  dies instead of him and charmander lives or he gets badly hurt and charmander kills him, saving squirtel and bulbasaur gets freed and finally what happened to bulbasaur??
HES BACK I FUCKING LOVE U
It only took 30 years
ITS BACKKKK
will it take another 2 years for ep 11 an then also for 12
Snover: And that is the Legend of Blue Shell Man Guy. Another Snover: Man that is the craziest thing I have ever heard!
i think we're getting a prequel next episode, there's so much missing after the last 9 episodes
Finally
Bro I  Fucking Missed This SO GOD DAMN MUCH AND YOU BROUGHT THIS TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF BADASS! I really hope the next episode is soon and won't take a while like this one did
I just realized this came out 2 more episodes to go
Rip charmander
I kinda wish charmander didn't die
NO FRICKING WAAAAAAY
Ok lets wait for another year for another episode :D
"you're just using us to relive your stupid childhood!" *27 year old me clutches my copies of heartgold and soulsilver*
One episode has to be about mewtwo beating the corruption
Hopefully charmander comes back to life
I really hope charmander comes back, i miss him ;'(
I miss the og starters so much
See you in another 2 years!
This gave me chills.
Poor squirtle he has been through so much
Yes it finally came out now time to wait another year to episode 11
Finally Ep 10 now we wait another 2 years for Episode 11 but still it’s worth the wait
At last. I waited ages for this
R.i.p my boi charmander and bulbasaur
Awesometacular
It was definitely worth the wait
Wowowowo
Please don’t take so long for the other episodes
the two gods are dialga and palkia
FINALLY THE WAIT IS OVER!!!  Edit: just finished watching and damn man just became Kratos
ITS FINALLY HERE
Beautiful... simply magnificent...
Yes yeeeees its finnaly heeeeeereeeee yeeeeees
“WHAT THE F-“ **fucking explodes**
Did he say a no no word
See y’all in two years for the next episode
Finally new episode
I’m so excited to wait another year wo
Okay, see y'all in a couple years.
Two years for episode 10 to release! Totally worth the wait, I can tell you've put a lot of effort into this 👍👏👏👏
WHAT THE Ff-
:0 its back!? Woooo!
Where’s bulbasaur
congrats on makine #18 on the very very skewed trending liat
The Snovers sound so familiar but I can't put my finger on it. That guy must have voiced in an old animation, maybe something from Spazkid or Egoraptor or maybe some Machinima. I can't remember
My guess is that the God is mewto and maybe he could restart or revive charmander also cause mewto was in the background
The story telling so good..
OMG the bedoofs are voiced by "Dawn somewhere"  I freaking love that man!
Now I will patiently wait another 4 years
squirtle's story is actually really sad. how he completely obeyed the caterpie leader, how his only friends died (technically only charmander died but still), and how he kept clinging into the past is just so sad
Worth the wait
i usually pick charmander as a starter now I’m want to choose blastoies
I waited for 2 years!!!!!!!!
If charmanders blaze activated  he would still be alive
War turtle time
i waited for this, I. Love. It
when pokemon becomes GOT by killing off the main character.
This is deep
Waited 2 years for this
2 for that I guess 10 more years for not content
man you really know how to hit the feels man
Big fan!
You are awesome
Vengeance and trauma can really corrupt someone. I hope Wartortle doesn’t become consumed by anger.
What happened to charmander ?
Yay
This deserves #18 on trending
Yup, that was absolutely worth the wait.
Yes
no….no…..noo charmander. Why?!??
12:51 pretty sure people saw this,which is a pretty cool secret. But also what the caterpillar said after the secret of “mutual destruction” may not be only what happened to them but also what’s happening.
lets go great ep now lets wait three years for ep 11
I was so happy for this moment!
Who’s been waiting forever?
YESSsSsss it’s back!!!!
Weird that i literally thought of this this morning and here it is
I like how the snow monster’s final words were “WHAT THE FU-“
Finally releasing starter squad after 9 trillion years
Episode 11 pls
YES SEE YA IN 5 YEARS FOR EPISODE 11
Why did charmander have to die I loved him
Oh yeah I forgot this existed
2 YERS BETTER BE GOOD
Finally omg
If squirtle doesn't evolve by level 98 he can never become a blastoise until he find a candy
Whoever complains about their favorite shows season coming out in a year has to be quiet bc we all waited 8 years for only 10 godly episodes to be released.
finally geez
My enemy is now caterpie!!
Aww man, I’m kinda sad that charmander died but I understand why
Chimchar sounds so annoying
I knew charmander had a...crushing defeat but didnt realize how bad it actually was lol
How is chimchar loosing to bidoof
After watching this I’m about to watch all the episodes in order! But god please don’t make us wait another 1-2 years for episode 11 🥺
OMG YESSSS FINALLY
Wartortle: jumps 2 billion feet into the air  also Wartortle: Climbs the mountain by walking.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LOONGG THANKk YOU. These animations are amazing btw keep it up man I really hope there will be more than twelve
FINALLY
FINALLY IVE BENN WAITING FOR TWO YEARS
I feel like Wartortle is going to ask Dialga to go back in time to fix everything he messed up and save Charmander from being killed by Caterpie.
Nooo he died😭😭😭
OH MY GOD ITS HERE
ive finnaly been waiting for
hey what is the 11 comeing??
Yes finally did it After all these years thank you
FINALLY, ITS HERE AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME OF WAITING (2 years)
Another 2 years
Finally
Time to wait another year for another episode
I have a theory! It's Dialga and Wartortle is going to get him to go back in time to be with charmander and bulbasuar.
it has been a lonng time
Hot diggity, that was good! I feel sad for Charmander tho.
Its here...
I NEVER EXPECTED SQUIRTLE TO BECOME SUCH A BAD ASS-
palkia and dialga gonna send him back in time? my theory rn considering the whole gen 4 aspect and squirtle going to "the gods"
Bird sounds, bird sounds come out of me 🤣
Ten years
is squirtle teaming with some starters 5 years younger than him
After all these years.......I feel heartless still.......even after this,I feel like I don't remember everything. It's too long for me to enjoy it.
We need charmander and bulba sur back :(
I don't care, this is Canon.
Damn, this got heavy. I was duped into caring... Good job, I miss Charmander
Please make more I really like these
This the grandest episode I have ever seen
It's better than I ever could have imagined.
Let gooo
This is the best episode
I have been waiting for this moment
Im sad that charmander died but i think muwtwo will revive him and what huppend to bulbasuar?
The snovers are amazing
YES
👌 awesome
I better not wait another year for the next ep
FINALLY
Time to wait another 2 years :)
It’s professor science with Stan beaker as snover!
Squirtle has been through some ish
YES ITS HERE
Glad to see a new episode
Some things were just too annoying for me. The Snover being a huge thing that got under my skin.
Time to wait another 2 years...
2 more episodes…….
It won’t be starter squad anymore right lmao
it toke 10 years bro wev ben waiting man
0:59: Twitch Plays Pokemon Reference
Your family redeem yourself another episode
FINALLY
Yes final
this is amazing!!!
Great episode! See you all again in 2025!
I love this
I feel hurt about this episode. Like it just leaves questions and wasn't one of the plots of a past episode was to see mewtwo to help him? Like it leaves a lot of questions and just seems like the plot flipped hard. I want to know where this is going, but just felt...distasted from this episode.
I fear charmander will come back as a charizard but evil May just be me but that scares me
So Squirtle evolved into Kratos.
"Who are THEY to decide THAT?"  Man, Squirtle is so COOL!
I like how the Abomasnow fight could literally be a video game boss battle. Even the animation reflects that.
Oh man, this was worth the wait.
Bulbasaur is actually the voice of reason this time
Holy hell this was amazing
Why is squirrel not evolving
Best pokemon series on YouTube, this is too good
Now starter squad become medium squad.
FINALLY IT HAS COME, AFTER A MILLION YEARS OF WAITING
I just need 11 and12
NOW THIS IS LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!
11 place
Best title ever.
I've been watching this since I was 4 this has changed my life
It’s a coincidence that this video came out right before the release of the Sinnoh remakes.
Omfg finally it came out
So, Squirt is the protagonist and Squirtle is my favorite Kanto Starter.....and this story is A.W.E.S.O.M.E. What if Squirt--- uhh no, Wartortle actually defeated the Gods? That would be insane.
Finally it been like 3 year or 2 then it going to be like 5 year for the next one
Make part 11 in this one it take bake a flash back and the last carterpee was still alive but squideul donut know but he goes to the Pokémon gods here but
I bet he is going to ask the Pokémon gods to bring back charmander
AEYEYEYEYEYEYEY3YRYRRYR
When is more episodes coming
Damn squirtle.....bro been through hell
Here is a theory: when warturtle go up he's gonna meet one of the gods he's either gonna ask can he have charmander back or char back
no charmander im out
He better bring charmander back to life too
All the people waiting for them to drop:We knew you’d come back
We’ve been waiting for so long
This is amazing
Thanks shippiddge finaly episode 10 after a long time! :)
Yes it’s here
Calling it now, in the last like, 3 in a half minutes, the Pokémon gods are Red and his team.
I really hope Charmander fake his death and the hat that caterpie use is fake :(...
Seeems like 1 year per episode
Prepare for another two years
Episode 10 let’s gooooo
22:56  Warturtle makes the vid family friendly again
Rip charmander
When is next coming out
Really exelently done Shippiddge and team. The animation and general look of the charaters and the world has really improved since the earlier episodes,really liked the design and characters of the ainchent guardian Abomasnow. And Squirtle becoming numb to his training and havng no control of his actions after Charmanders death(which was a really bold but good move) and going along with Caterpie's training and the war she carelessly kept going at till it destroyed everything was really sad. And Squirtle trying to fill back the void left by Charmander and Bulbasaur for 3 regions now is pretty dam tragic. Looking forward as to what the final two episodes will turn out to be. Keep up the awesome work guys
OMG LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes finally  Me:it's been a long time since a video published  now don't take another year for another video
About F'n time!
The next episode is gonna be great
Worth the wait good stuff
(

t o u c h   t h e   b i d o o f h e   t o u c h e d  6   b i d o o f
I waited a year for this                                                                                                         I love it
Would charmander turn to a Gastly? Like what hunter said in episode 8 he said “if you die you turn into this” and he pointed at Gastly
yay another episode of starter squad cant wait for the other for 2 years
What an episode, that final scene between Caterpie and Squirtle was truly something.
When I saw Charmander's severed head my heart sank
YESSSSSSS PART TEN IS OUT YESSSSSSSSSSS
12:48 mewtwos back

Maybe mewtwo revives charmander because he needed charmander to help with missingno
Rip charmander I rlly wanted him to evolve
I can't wait to see where this goes.
yessssss after sooooo long it here
im really dispointed that charmander died like he need to be charizard and charmeleon im not happy at all
poor bird noise bird
I love it the story telling, the drama plus maybe at the end he will ask to bring back charmander but that unrealistic
Guess 2 years again
RIP Charmander he fought with great honor he was a good man he will be missed 😞
Charmander isn’t dead in episode 8 the ghost said if you die you turn in to a ghost
Hoooooly fudge. THATs a bloody comeback. Years of waiting, way past worth it! Amazing bloody job!
Holy Shit.
The king has returned
I'll happily miss out 2x events for this video

Yes finalyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Finally after years
After 1 year
Omg a new episode! Im so exited to see it good thing we didnt need to wait another year thanks to.... lets not finish that sentence, shall we?
Finally
Is it going to take another 2 years for part 11
So we're abandonning the whole "Missing No" story then?  This was good, but I'm really upset you just wrote off Bulbasaur and Charmander like that.
Wohoooooo
I’ve been waiting so long yessssss
INFALLY FUCK YEAHHHH
Worth every day of the wait. How do you keep outdoing yourself my guy?
Squirtle: *about to die* Also Squirtle: *gets slightly bigger*
finally i have been waiting for so long
Well time to wait another 2 years for episode 11
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭CHARMANDER ❤❤❤❤
Good stuff it looks pretty intense I like it. Keep up the great work.
yes after 1000 yeara
It's finally HERE
We need mr beast to donate 10k for this man’s budget
Imagine if he evolved in to blastosie and some how mega evolved and g maxed at the same tom to fight arceus
LES A FUCKING GOOOOOO
Can’t wait to see bulbasaur become a vegetated venasuar being a literal power source to an entire Amazon
That scene with distraught Caterpie asking an emotionless Squirtle what to do was actually really powerful. Also I wonder what happened to Whiskers. Pretty clear she tried to fight Bluey but still.
After waiting patiently and watching the whole thing it was all worth it I declare this as the best Pokémon animation ever.
Man you can’t leave us one year an episode. I will legit play for animators. I just want more
I’m sad that charmander died but this was firw
So what are you going to do after this god tier series?
Legend is back
Makes me made that we waited 2 years just to see one of the most boring character evolve before Charmander and then we don’t even get to see Charmander for the whole episode. I was a little bit disappointed because Charmander and Bulbasaur were some of my favorite characters.
Level 99 Wartortle bouta fight god. This has gone off the rails. And I'm totally down for it.
Ah yes, we just need 3 or 6 more years to go before this sotry is dond
Theory charmander is not dead   Most likely charmander is dead I'm just saying this he's my favorite starter
Ive have been waiting for this
FINALLY
ch-charmander was ma boy starter sqwad were ma boys
Holy snap I swear I haven’t watched this in 2 years
Finally
How long has it been since the first 9 episodes?
worth waiting for
Hey it's back!
Lets gooooooooo
What's written on the back of Charmanders' head?
Chimchar dying was supposed to be emotional scene but I just busted out laughing when he said "you can tell he's dead because he has x's over his eyes".
Things that you shouldn’t ask girls her weight boys his salary sippedge when episode 11 is going to come out
*bird noises*
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING
finally
Where is the humor? This was lame. Kill 9 episodes of fun build up to turn it to some basic mundane cookie cutter anime plot.
I love the beaver society Edit: That was really sad edit 2; what ever happened to the part with Mewtwo attacking the glitch thing
Absolute dog shit all the wait for nothing
I'm so glad that the 10th episode is finally here. I've been waiting for so long🙌
This was more than i was expecting.  Awsome!!
HES BACK BOYS
Welp, the first bit began and ended with charmanders' story, looks like the rest is left up to wartortle.  I'm not gonna forgive squirtle for what he's done, i just hope wartortle can up for them in the remainder videos
So what about charmander ?
Oh man, now we're gonna get into some time travel shenanigans, I bet. Also, Mewtwo's still fighting Missingno? Guy's got some stamina.
PULL UP LETS GOOO THIS WAS LIT
this arc is depressing
God Of War 2: The End Begins
Finnaly this man uplouded
We have waited what felt like years.
Congratulations on the new ep but sadly it was a massive downgrade
Man went from base form to freaking super sayin blue
I hope the next episode will be about bulbsaur cuz i really want to know what really happen to bulbsaur
mASTER pIECEEEEEEEEE  iLOVE iT
It's finally hear
I saw missingno and mewtwo are fighting
I'm willing to help animate the show if it can be done fast
ITS HERE OMFG AMAZING
We all waited for the day when ep 10 will come out
AFTER 1 YEAR
Omg it has been so long since I watched you
Rip charmander
really wish there was another dimension where charmander was still alive
I really thought charmander wasn't going to die I thought he was going to evolve or smth, I really hate that caterpie, just why did charmander have to die I really thought he was going to survive, stupid caterpie.       :( R.I.P charmander the coolest of the team.
Nice job
We missed this omg!!!
Okay, the Giant Abomasnow, which i'll be calling Snow, because the Snover call him that, wasn't actually bad, in my opinion.  If the Gods he talks about have the power you'd excpect Gods to have, you're damn right he'll follow any orders from them if he wants to stay alive, no choices for him.  Snow did quite litterally *kill* Chimchar, but he brought that upon himself.  Lastly, this series is back, and i couldn't be happier
Jesus Christ is coming back very soon I know you might’ve heard it before but it’s true or else you wouldn’t be seeing it.Prophecy the Bible spoke of is coming to pass now like never before.God doesn’t want any of you to perish what I mean is whether you believe it or not we are all sinners who have fallen short of His glory and without His mercy we were destined to hell bc we have transgressed God’s law which we are all guilty of so God sent His son Jesus to save sinners like you and I He died a brutal death on the cross and 3 days later rose up from the grave to pay the price/wages of all our sins so if we have Faith in Jesus believe in Jesus death,resurrection and repent of urs sins confessing  Him as Lord would be saved don’t wait another day call upon His name NOW is the time.He loves you so much!❤️❤️
the time has come, it has finally come
1 flipping year whens ep 11
when the world needed him most, he returned
Rest and peace charmander
Daaaang, this series has taken some unexpected turns!   Well worth the wait.
NOO why did charmander have to dieeee 😭
Dang it’s been a year since this. Rest in piece charmNder 😭😭😭😭😭
CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
HEY TURTLE  I REALY HOPE  YOU  CAN HEAR THIS YOU CAN  REVIVE  CHARMANDER BY GETTING  A PIECE  OF HIM AND  AND GIVE IT TO A HUMAN THAT HAS PINK HAIR HER NAME  IS NURS JOY SHE HAS A CHANCEY AND A HEALING MACHINE THAT CAN REVIVE DEAD POKEMON WAIT IF  YOU  CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS SQURT SQURTLE SQURTLE  QURT SQURT SQURT

Oye podrías borrar ese capítulo crea un nuevo Charmander evoluciona charmeleon yo no quiero gue Charmander evoluciona porfavor 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
I have waited for you for 2 years
its back
The wait is over and all I have to say is……nice
I wanna cry Charmander actually died😭
I’m finally happy :)
YAY! i Finnished ep 10 now we have to wait annother 1 year
Squirtle looks like the protagonist of Russian war film *Come and See* at the end of it. It's remarkable. This is the best episode yet.
Its that time of the year starter squad episode F for Charmander
Man I forgot about this :,)
I hope charmander is alive again he was my favorite
I’ve been waiting for so long and finally it is here
i dont wanna believe charmander is dead i wanna see charmander again
12:51 they're still fighting
We have to wait a another year
Now i don't want to wait next year for the next one to come out :/
cant wait for the next episode
HES BACK
After a year, finally
why did this take like two and a half years, This is a pokemon show not a movie
I’ve waited for this moment for 100- no 3000 years!
I've waited 3 no, 100 years for this.
Charmander died... He DIED... He was changing... WHY!?!?!?
Great episode, man. The wait was worth the while. I really remembered enjoyed the original starter squad. But...what happened to piplup? Why is he replaced with squirtle?
Shiidd I been waiting for this for like 10 years  Edit: after watching this I want the og starters back there is no scene what happened to bulbasaur and charmander
THE WAIT IS OVER! You always do such a great job! It makes me so happy that you finally uploaded!
I wasn't expecting to be cuck slapped across the face with this storyline
SPOILER...                      Theory: Maybe, one Squirtle defeats these "Gods" He can control TIME and SPACE in order to go back in time, perhaps as Mewtwo or something to save Charmander and his other friends
This was worth the 2 years of wait.
Wow this episode was amazing now all we have to do is wait another 20 years shouldn't take that long.
Great job bro best one yet I can’t Believe it the only thing I hope is I don’t have to wait 2 years:)
No way
Omg it’s back it’s been 1 year ty
Wait what happened to MissingNo and I think something about time travel and what
Amazing as always
Finally after months
The Snovers were my favourite. They sound like King Shark from the Harley Quinn animated show.
I miss charmander
The hope is the og starters are still alive
A moment of silence to those who died before they could watch this video
What happened to ma boi charmander he was my favorite
alas a upload
I waited forever for this and I'm not disappointed one bit
Another episode another few years XD
What charmander is dead ? I thought he was the chosen one
We're is charmender he is ELOVE
Finally after 2 years it's finally here
Okay, I'm saying this now, I fricken LOVE Wartortle's voice!!🥰🥰😆😆
Why is the og starters dead without a really impactful scene :(
I thought charmander was the chosen one tho
Fuck yeah
I LOVE THE SNOVERSSS
it was at this moment squirtle remembered there was a pokemon center and brought his friends back to life, but lets hope he gets sent back in time and the end is just like the start where he just got chosen by the trainer but this tie he knows whats to come
prediction for episode 11. He climbs up and meets Giratina, Palkia, Dialga, and Arceus. Wartortle does his monologue stuff, and the Legends explain who and what they are. After potentially fighting and evolving, Blastoise comes close to death, as he can't fight 1-4. Arceus spares his life, seeing pain and grief over his lost friends. Giratina the God of death, brings the spirit of charmander, and Charmander explains he was only trying to save him. Feeling guilty, Blastoise regrets ever becoming a war machine. Dialga and Palkia, the Gods of time and Space gives Blastoise the opprotunity to travel 10 years back in time to fix everything
Im sorry but, the plot has changed so much… I don’t see Starter Squad in it. It doesn’t feel like it belongs there, it feels so out of place. It’s more annoying to watch these tree guys than watching charmander roasting other Pokémons.  I am really dissatisfied
Great series. How do they skirt copyright laws?
Congrats on getting on Trending! This series truly deserves it.  😁
SOMETHING
Am I only person who be sad for charmander's dead?😪
2 more left
i binge watched this entire series only a week ago. what a coincidence!
It's been a long time coming. So excited
Finally
Pls do a next episode
YES FINALLY
Now make your manner come alive because of the great God
Can you make Charmander come back alive
Bro I want to freaking kill caterpie. Seeing the charmander head on caterpie made me get hella sad and it freaked me out. This is insanely cool and I want to see where the story goes
Squirtle becomes doomguy... Huh great story
TIME TO REWATCH THE WHOLE THING AND THEN ENJOY THE HELL OUTTA THIS
Has anyone else been waiting 2 years for this?? - From a watcher since Ep.1
EP 11 RN LOL WHAT A GOOD SERIES! (Good luck on the new episode!)
👉🏼
Finally
Oh my god The snow monster is creepy
LETS GOO CHARMANDER DIEED
Yey👍👍😊😊
Here before 1M!
i feel emotionally sick. i miss charmander and i wish it would have gone on. ;^;
Did charmender died
I was in elementary when I started this and I’m about to graduate soon and this is an indescribable feeling but it’s incredible
OH MY GOD I FORGOT ABOUT THIS SERIES, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
WE BEEN WAITING DAM
i love the whole thing 10 out of 10
I like this more than the original serie
Spoilers:      I wonder if the decision to kill off charmander and shift the focus of the story to squirtle was planned from the start or improvised.
Please bring charmander back mew could bring him back to life
Is bulbasaur and charmander will know about squirtle Evoled?
I was really shocked at the plot twist but I’m curious to see what’s next What really hurt is that not only did Charmander die but Chimchar too
FINALLEEEEE
omg finally
Kinda Wish That Charmander Lived…I am gonna miss him….
This is depressing, charmander was my favourite character
Your videos are so good
YES
Make a episode 11
Omg it’s happening!!!!! 😁😁
all started when red pick squirtle and pablo died
This is better than game of thrones and I liked that a lot
chimchar is just a bad charmander
Watch what happens when I cast a spell I don't know
Theory: Wartortle (aka Squirtle) is going to go to the gods and tell them to bring Charmander back to life
Deltarune Chapter 2 has ruin me with the flashbacks
Nothing better to do than wait another year to watch ep 11
anyone know the song at the end ?
THE KING HAS RETURNED!!!!!!
🥵
Bring back charmander some how I hate that he is dead
Ive been waiting for 1 year for this
I TOTALLY forgot about you lol
NO WAY IT IS ACTUALLY OUT
This  series is amazing but I'm sad  Charmander died
Anyone else get Deltarune Weird Route vibes from Squirtle with Caterpie?
ok
Good soldiers follow orders
That was........ interesting.          Congratulations on making something even more crazy and fun to watch.
This is great I can’t wait to see squirtle’s redemption arc come full circle and now we are seeing him becoming what charmander was becoming and I can’t wait to see what dat is in the finale  Prediction: I think squirtle now wartortle may or not evolve into blastoise to take on dialga but I don’t think he will win maybe with a mega but just as wartortle or blastoise I don’t think so I think what will happen is dialgo will go back in time but not cuz of wartorle but cuz of missingNo mewtwo is still fighting him so far what we saw is he is not winning missingNo is goin beat mewtwo and absorb him then from there will be the final battle and I don’t think palkia giritina or arceus will show either cuz dat wouldn’t be fair but we will see someday
8:14 Fuck this i am out  For fuck sake you have 1 Job to not let it happen Slow clap i Wait for this long and this is the reward for all this wait a freaking dead Charmander GJ... Anyways great animations and voice actors  and still intresting story but what happen és mewtwo and that thing ? Yeah yeah 2 eps left we will see 0_0” Maybe some time travel
YES 1YEARS LATER
Great!
That was amazing.
The whole story was pretty cool nice job man! especially the Wartortle fight!
I watched this when I was 12 lol
No way
I'm so f'n happy you continued this guy's ot was awesome truly one of the best pokeworld stories ever created PLEASE don't stop creating these let alone for q long time again I'm a fan for life I'll wait however long but I ask not forever
Two years I have waited to find out charmander is actually dead and bulbasaur wasn't even in the episode
This is one of the best things I have ever seen.  Great job everyone 👏!!
*The*
FINALLY I'VE WAITING FOR 900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 YEARS FOR THIS!
That was amazing.
Bro this is trash Charmander was the one that kept on making me watch this I don't even want to watch this no more
Where is bulbasaur by the way?
Make Squirtle have revenge of that girl that he killed Charmander
He’s spend years following, he was broken. I mean charmander is dead now. I began watching this series laughing and exited for the new episode, I don’t want to watch the next episode this rollercoaster of emotions has been a lot.
squirtle is warturtle
Good to see mewtwo still giving it all at 12:50
here we are were back agin
Can't wait for the last 2 episodes
Finally... Totally worth the waiting!! Thanks for this precious treasure!
The end part is heavy metal
OMG THE SHOW IS BACK FINALLY
i would waste my master ball on this Wartortle
DEAD HES DEAD
AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE WAS RISEN
Great finally the episode is here
What is there to say about this masterpiece…?
No not charmander I hate wormsssssss
Well, see you all in 2023 when mewtwo has to come to fix all of this mess
is see why it took so long
Omg
This is so cool
I was 3 years old when I started watching this now 2 more episodes
so, what happened to mewtwo and missingno?
See you all again in two years 🙏🏾🤞🏾✌🏾
What move did Wartortle use 22:57?
I thought chum char was reincarnated charmander
The fact Mewtwo never got to rest due to Charmander dying makes me feel so bad for Mewtwo mainly ngl.
where can we find the rock music that was shown on the credits? it's so good O:
A certain pig with a crown in a block game is hinting in the video
OH MY GOD HE IS GONNA ASK SOMETHING!!!?!??!!?!?
Its been too long but it is soo good
Started watching this series when I was ten and six years later it does not dissapoint this was great
Also I like the new wartortle's voice
Hype
IT FINNALY HERE
Finally.
he's back!!
Charmanders death was abrupt as heck, but I think thats what makes this series so realistic. You don’t always get a chance to make things right. Sometimes you are killed unjustly.
Finally after two long years it returns!
FINALLY I CAN DIE HAPPY HAHAHAHA
Finally we’ve been waiting for a year
Was worth the wait
a G MAX Abomosnow puff out
Ok cool now we have to wait another 5 years for a new episode 👍🏼🥳😃
12:50
Next episode: Mewtwo vs Wartortle
to all those who says this took too long to come out, you try making a good 3d animated story-driven animatic.
Can you make ep 11 so we know what happend to charmander
Why do u make charmander die
Finally, a show that kills the main character
FINALLY
Long wait is gone 😛
This is actually pretty sad. I would have never expected charmander to die. I guess he did and squirtle got ptsd from the trauma and he seeks to rebuild his past.. that’s pretty bizarre for such an innocent looking story.
FINALLY
The character development, this story is epic.
And so, Legends say he's still up there, doing battle with the Game Freak devs to this day... the end.
Here lies the death of a legend, charmander
Need cap 10 with subtitles spanish:c
OMG YOU’RE FREAKING BACK AHHHHHHHH
FIIIIINNNNAAAAALLLLLYYYYYY
ngl ⟟ THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD
Please don’t take another 2 years to make a new episode
I'm really happy that this has finally came out but now we have to wait pretty sure 2 years again for the ep 11
*Wil Squirtle come face to face with God?, will Charmander and Bolbasuar come back?, will Mewtwo ever defeat  the Glitch?. We’ll find out, on next episode of Dragon Ball Z*
Char actuly died Me: yeah it actuly happend
Best episode ever
Excellent!!!  Now for the next 2 year wait.  😂😂😂😂…😕
Oml it’s finally out hooray!
Hey im confused now about the lore we need matpat here
Wow....Just WOW. I didn't expect to have so many feels....Flawless work!!
I really hope we get a wrap to the missingno subplot from the previous episodes.
He was PTSD BRO
Finally ep ten!
FINALLY
If Squirtle is that powerful when he evolves into Wartortle Imagen how powerful Charmander would be if he evolved into Charmeleon or if he evolved into Charizard *OR MAYBE HE WILL*  Edit: I would bet we all want to see what happens so please do us all a huge favor A N D  M A K E  T H E M  F A S T E R (i mean i dont want to rush you but jeez)
Callling it now.  The Legendary is going to spend Squirtle back in time.
Squirrel as the main character…I’m not into it
"truly our friends are the most replaceable people we know" he says as he replaces the other snover
Well, time to wait 3 years again.
I kinda just wanted to see what happened after charmander died instead of 10 years later
EPISODE 10 HAS COME BOIS
WHAT NO WAY WHAT THE FUCK
Ok but where is ep 11
Holey Jesus this was the best series I’ve ever watched thank you for my child hood
LETS GOOO ITS OUT!
My, man the squad is back, but with a from another region except Squirtle.
Pls next episode
Please make an episode 11
Wait what happened to the first  9 episodes what happened to Charmander did he die???
YES FINALLY
See you guys November 2023
I watched the first episode because I thought it was a nice spoof on Pokémon. But now... Jesus, I'm getting Attack on Titan vibes. I want to know more, how the story will unravel itself. Mewtwo, Missingno, the gods... I hear a lot of timetravelling here. Seems the most obvious thing to do, yet I wonder. @Shippidge, is the plan still only 2 episodes or has the future expanded?
he's back boiiiiiiis
Where were you
Finally part 10🤣😭😃😃😃😀😀😂😂😂😭😭😭
finally?
What if there was a Twist that Charmander survived and killed all of the Caterpie and Bulbasaur followed along
I’m truly glad the first episode in 2 years is worth the wait.
I can't believe Charmander actually died! I feel so bad
Oh my god 🤗😮😮😲😲
FINALLY
it's sad and pathetic how you follow disgusting  artists on twitter  who draws Disturbing art on children characters  bruh 😑😒
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I actually gasped when I saw this on autoplay
I've been waiting for three years
this is so good i hope there would be a season 2 with another 12 episodes and there are different starters in that season. and if there is and youre seeing this then plz put squirtle in it
FINALLY HE IS BACK!!!!! btw are you still slowpoke dude
FINALLLYLLYLYLY
God bless this series. I remember when there was only 2 episodes. Keep doing a great job man
I hope it never ends
Another ten year for the next episode
took 90 years
I still don’t know what happened to Bulbasaur. Last we saw him he was being used as a feeding thing for the Caterpie. This episode never showed what happened to him
OMG
I didn’t want charmander to dir 😢
This shit is fire
Wait so no one's gona acknowledge the fact that charmander actually died like all that charachter development wasted
What about Mew 2 and the glitch pokemon there's so much unanswered
When will it be continued in 3 years
This has gone from 0 to over 9000 fast. Will Wartortle have the strength to challenge the gods. Find out next time on Starter Squad Z.
so if has been 10 years for them does that mean there unvierse if faster by 5 seconds bc if we wait 5 seconds that equals to one second to them
Is that the end?
omg its finnaly out!!!
I begged you bring him back and are we going to see Mewtwo and you need to bring to reminder back and we're probably going to see me Charmander back
Kind of sad to think there’s only gonna be two more didn’t it start like seven years ago
Charmander can't. She's has to be life Charmander back
*HOLY SHIT THIS IS A GOD OF WAR REFERENCE*
Its here
wow this episode is very good
Chimchar my new favorite
This is Dark...      I LOVE IT!
What did the bidoofs do tho they were just vibin
OH MY GOD FINALLY
See y’all in another two years
Yesss
ITS HERE
I now realize something. Spoiler warning if you havent watched.          So episode 8 had mewtwo warn charmander and bulbasaur of missingno and told them to meet at cerulean cave after finding squirtle. Now, with charmander being dead, mewtwo has spent the past 10 years stopping missingno. Now I'm wondering if the missingno will come into play at the end.
18:29
Finally
To be fair, Chimchar got what he deserves for attempting to destroy and deny Beaver Society.
Wait is bulbasaur dead too?
I watched Patterrz's reaction of your video and I think your video is so cool I love it and I subscribed to you today.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss
Mewtwos gotta be pissed
Wait what you don’t have 1M yet, I wish you luck of getting 1M
Press "F" to pay respect for charmander
17:03 looks like a boss fight you would see
Top 10 animes
My guess is that Wartortle evolves, takes on Dialga, wins, and is rewarded with a time reset, which takes them back before Squirtle is chosen by the original human.
FINALLY
He couldn't save his friend, but now the gods shall fear his name.
I've been waiting for the longest time for this.
YEAAAAAAAH THAT WAS AWESOME now to wait another 2 years for the next episode yeah
FINALLY THE TENTH EPISODE IS OUT
Possibly get a chance to start over when charmander created the missing no if he beats the gods either way I’m curious to what happened to it you definitely should being paid the story line is a lot deeper then most shit put out today
Congrats on the release on episode 10! This just twisted all my emotional strings, rip charmander and bulbasaur. live on dreamers 😔✊🏻
11:50 ok this is very funny
I’ve been waiting for over a year for this
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was 60k like
Why did you not mourn over charamanders death
Actually think that the head might be a replacement for charmander and he actually evolved later on
27 on trending
He’s back
Omg finally
time to wait another 3 years
Holy fucking shit it’s finally here omg omg omgg
This series is everything amazing and a very funny story keep up the good work guys!
Finally!
woah 30 minutes Nintendo Hire this man
This took a massively different turn. Like the past 9 episodes storylines were erased.  *No conclusion to Missing No *Charmander Didn't look for Mewtwo in Cerulean Cave
Man this story is just so good 😭
Ur back with the milk
OMG it's here!!!!!!!!!!
Today is a good day
Lol NICE
Top 10 anime battles
I love how the caterpie saw charmander as an uncontrollable tyrant while the leader became what he wanted to destroyed
i didnt really like this episode. it made a character only for them to die and then killed of the main character. i hope you do better if you make another series
Uhhm helo
Thats some really good voice acting. Better than alot of dubb'ed anime
Holy crap man I waited so long for episode 10 and then hoping the Charmander wouldn’t die
I never liked charmander in this So i mean I wasn't sad when I noticed his head was a hat XD
IT FINALLY CAME
When Squirtle is going to evolve
Finally ep 10, I will watch now.
Less gooo new episode
after 1 year.. the legend is here.
based on how long it took for this one we'll be waiting for another 4-6 years for the last 2
Hell yeah
26:18 Don't think you can sneak that little Agumon past my eyes!
Dang this episode was amazing and badass can’t wait to find out what happened next
I feel like he’ll request for either a restart back when he met the squad or rebirth charamander and find bulbasaur to the “Pokemon gods”
so squirtle really kill charmander  >.<  if charmander is dead what happen with Bulbasaur?
Jeez the last episode was 2 years ago I just feel so old now
LETS GO
FINALLY. I've been waiting forever. WOO-HOO!!
ITS PUT YES
I did Charmander got killed I know he was so angry but you can make him feel better you might change his ways but why did you have to kill him who is the monkey guy 🔥
Nice job I've been waiting for you to make your comeback I've watched since the beginning and I will watch to the end
Love the style of storytelling. Worth the wait, keep going!! Greetings from me and my friends from Germany ❤️
I feel like there's going to be endings with Charmander and Bulbasaur after the events that took
I’ve been waiting for so long and it’s finally here
HOLY SHIT
EP. 11
Ya know......... I can't say I'm upset Charmander got killed.  He was a dick.
I HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS IM SO HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
The Caterpie’s has killed Charmander but now it’s Chimchar, he was on a angry rampage with his temper. 😡😡😡
This episode was so amazing!. Can't wait for episode 11
There's something missingno
I don’t think there’s a happy ending here I think that squirtle dies honestly he might defeat palkia and dialga but he’s no match for arceus
Alright, time to wait another 3 years
10 yrs is accurate
When I first saw Chimchar I thought he was going to be someone who was inspired to be like Charmander after seeing the paintings and stuff from the Caterpies, and that Squirtle was going to be his trainer like Charmander was to him.
Shippiddge: *gets reincarnated*  Me: The return of the king
WHY DOES SQUIRTLE WANT TO STAY A SQUIRTLE. IF SQUIRTLE EVOLVED, HE WILL BE MORE TANKIER AND STRONGER
when I saw charmanders head I almost started crying man..
So the Charmander/Mewtwo story line is done... Now it's just Mewtwo
YESSSSS
After 1 year it’s out at last
Now to wait another year for the next episode 🤪
I like how it gets longer and longer from episode to episode
Stronger than goku?
The day has cane
Now where is ep 11??? Jk but fr is there more  coming out?
“Oh cool what are you going to ask?”  “….. something”
Poor Whiskers...
Yay
All man time to wait for the next ep
this is cool
I think i know why he calls chimchar 'char', its to cling on the memories he has of charmander. This is further explained by the fact that chimchar has a similar personality  to charmander.This is also the same for bulbasaur. Squirtle calls turtwig bulbasaur because he wants to remeber him forever.When i first watched this series i thought 'man hopefully charmander (who i thought was the mc) gets a lot of development' when actually it was squirtle all along.Keep the effort up and thanks for the vids.
Bro starter squad is back boi
Finally I’ve been waiting :)
15:15 this looks like a story I know and everybody in my country knows It started when Portugal wanted to get to India, then they thought that going around Africa would be a good idea, so they did, but in the cape of good hope (they at the time called it "Torment cape" because of what I'll say next) their ships would just crash and sink (it was because the coast went farther than they thought so they would crash into the coast) but they thought there was a giant keeping everyone from entering or leaving the cape. The giant was called "Adasmastor" and he looked like how we stereotypically think what Zeus looked like (white hair and beard) but completely naked. The Portuguese eventually crossed the cape but in the book called "Os Lusíadas" written by the most famous Portuguese writer and poet, Luis de Camões that said they crossed it peacefully not *KILLING* him like Warturtle did but they used words. We can interpret the snow in snoway is the people thinking it was just ocean when it was a bad place to be there. The Abomasnow and the Adamastor since both didn't want anybody to cross the cape we can see clear similarity and plus, they both looks really old, are giants, both have white beards, it just fits.
I really don't understand!!!! Where is charmander??? Where is bulbasauur?
The Return of the King
I can’t believe Charmander really died…. Wow
YESSSSSS
Chimchar: ANARCHY WILL PREVAILL! Technoblade: I raised em well
HOLY SHIT
I didn’t really like this episode no offense
When squirtle evolves and is shining I think it's his torrent ability
0oooo000ooooOOOOO   (Translation: It's finally here!)
ITS BACK LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I remember coming upone the first episode 4-5 years ago how this series has grown
for the algorithum
Rip Charmander🥲
yes its back i cant wat to laugh
The most badass Pokémon series I have ever watched, game freak u better be payin attention 👀 loll
how did Squirtle get to Sinnoh?
8:14
Can't wait for next episode!!!! Sad charmander died tho also WHAT IS THE ENDING MUSIC IT IS AMAZING!
Yoooo it’s finally here!
Damn 😩  Episode fire like always.
This episode is worth the wait, with improved animation and more epic storytelling, but it’s honestly kinda sad to see how the original Pokémon starter square evolve, with squirtle being basically dead inside, charmander’s death, and bulbasaur not involving in anything. I kinda wanna see the return of the og squad since charmander is actually improving himself. Also why does Squirtle is having lots of “Vietnam flashbacks” lmfao
Finally
What happened to charmander
Anarchist Wartortle isn't what I was expecting, but it is what I wanted.
The new God of War is looking Great.
so I guess this is a world where all the water starters were picked? since we don't see piplup anywhere
Oh I get it, it's called snow way cuz there's _snow way_ they're gonna get past. I didn't expect to see this, cause I thought the series was over, and hot diggity dog, it was worth the wait.
I miss the og starter squad
I’ve been waiting for so long congratulations on making your 10th episode
YES EP.10
Anyone know what was written on Caterpie's "hat"?
It's here!
Worth the wait guys keep it up!!!!!
7 years later episode 11
Squirtle better have three wishes Wordle better bring back Charmander Bulbasaur and Chimchar
Ahora caterpi esmas peor fue Charmander porque 😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔
So this is the prelude to Legends Arceus.
Finally!
Damn  10 years Ive been following the serues for that long I feel old
the wait was worth it
Finaly no more wating
This series was my childhood I can’t believe it’s grown like this
So? Charmander and Bulbasaur really are dead?
bro i thought you died??
The tree's are my favorite :)
Damn.
Wait...if Charmander is dead...then what about the whole Mewtwo and Missingno mystery of episode 8?  How come Missingno hasn't taken over the reality in the 10 year gap?  So many questions!
Back when we needed him the most
Did Squirtle just become Kratos or am I tripping
supercool keep it up
Final 😭😭💔 12
Is charmander dead
As tradition, it's time to rewatch the entire series
Faltan 2 capítulo
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!
Yay!!! Finally Episode 10!!!! Love the series and it's awesomeness of Pokémon Parodies!! Keep it up^^
I hate that catterpie
You finally finished it after a few years
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!
Let’s go I’ve waited so long for this
YESSSSSS
me already knowing season 2 gonna be lite
22:59 When you When you
HORRAY
Crap Charmanders not actually dead is he?
Ah what a wonderful birthday gift, will be waiting in eager anticipation for the next episode
Now 5 more years for the next 2 episodes
Time to wait until 2024 for the next episode
Do not take long making 11
The next episod the y suold revive Charmander and bul
Charmander is............dead? 😭
So Charmander is dead? Welp, don't think I can watch this channel anymore.
green boots bro- turtwig has yellow boots- once again they are not even boots
Dang I forgot this series existed until now.. I can’t wait what episode 11 and 12 have in store, I bet it’ll be both a great episode and conclusion.
Also I miss Bulbasaur. He was nice funny cute and everything else good. I miss charmander because notmonly he rescued Bulbasaur and squirrels from the trainer. He looked for squirrel to get the team together! And he was killed by caterpie! The caterpie technically started it! Charmander used self defence!
Bien tefelesito 😉
I'm just wanna see charmander one last time
Thxs man you finally did it👍👏👏
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!!!!!!!
ITS BACK
NOOOO I DONT ACCEPT CHARMANDERA DEATH
You know what they say green boots. The mountains look high only from far away.
“So much for my character development.” -Charmander 2020
soo charmander is now monke and the vegetable is a turtle nice
HE'S AROSE
it's time to fight god
ITS BACK
Beaver society is the only society
12:45 so we just gonna ignore the fact that we saw Mewtwo fighting the glitch thing 😂
God If Wartortle I get it
God I cant wait for 11
ill be 45 by the next episode
finaly
Finally!!!!!
Squirrel ask the gods to bring charmander back to life! Aslo I'm kinda both excited and sad that squirrel evolved into wartortle. Wartortle is a 2nd evolution and as well as that charmander didn't get what he wanted, he wanted to evolve. Btw why isn't Piplup there? I'm not a fan of Piplup but I'm just questioning. Has Piplup been chosen on a journey? And what is bulbasaurs story? And finally what happens to Turtwig? I thought chimchar was a reincarnation of chimchar. We'll keep making those episodes!
So does charmander die or no
Bring back chamander
Can't wait 4 more years to see part 11
ITS been 2 years and it finally came out. This was very depressing and wholesome, but I need more context.
to be fair, who remembers turtwig.
now to wait a very long time for another one
Did Charmander die
awesome
Yo, this was awesome!! Been waiting for this, and damn it got dark. Wartortle has never been so cool!!
Yeah mannn
OH MY GOSH YOU REALLY WERE WORKING ON IT. I'm so happy! Thank you for the amazing content!
IT’S HERE BOIZ! On a side note, it’s pretty disappointing how Charmander went out.
THAT'S... AMAZING
Holy guacamole the wait was definitely worth it! This whole episode was a masterpiece and there's more to come! Thank you for all the hard work you and your team put into this, I can't wait for the next episode even if it takes a few years. You deserve so much more for the work you've done
Damm, puberty hit squirtal like a freight train
How long are you planning on making to finale?
Amazing
Good job this series is amazing
damn that reveal was subversive
X eyes mean death confirmed.
YESS I WAITED SO LONG
WE NEED PART 11
“It hurt my wittle twree feelings :( “-Snover
Pls say that charmander was alive because he was my favorite character.
Squirtle is a murderer
It has only been 5 years of  waiting 👴
Credit to red streak 94 for commenting this before me, but for everyone thinking wartortle will meet dialga, at 16:08 abomasnow is saying arceus in Japanese, he's going to meet arceus
Wait, it’s been 10 years, and Squirtle still has an evolved yet
How did he end up in johto
when the world needed them most... they returned
Where is Bulbasaur?
Im in live with the story 😍
See you guys in another 1-2 years
me clicking in this video: "Finally, I get to see if Charmander lived or not!"  *10 years later*  me: 22:58
Finally! I have been waiting for like a year now, maybe even two
look at us 1 year ago and look at us today
theory: squirtle/wartortle will meet dialga to fix everything
"Something"  - warturtle
Im so confused, where the hell is Charmandar and Bulbusaur?
i really cant wait for the rest of this series it is so good
We need more♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I like how it has a special thanks to WinCo Foods.
And after a thrilling episode another 2 year waiting period is in store for us
12:51 Didn’t anyone notice Mewtwo fight Missingno in the background?
IT'S HERE LESSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Dang its been 2 years
This whole series has been amazing! I love all these videos!
Where's Piplup
wow i cant believe ive been waiting for this for a year now
Finally!!!!!
dude you're fucking finally back!
It's gonna be another 5 months until we get the next episode
This is really taagic it doesn`t seem like there is hope there was reallly a character arc with quirtle and chrmander one seems to have changed to each others personality
I love the beaver society thing, because before I saw this I made up a island filled with bidoofs and made up bulshit facts and taught them in class
Wow just WOW!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
So we god of war now huh?
Part 11 soon Part 12 soon
THEY KILLED CHARMANDER  WTH
Gosh this episode was intense keep up the good work
Crap! Charmander died! ...Wonder what happened to Bulbasaur.
Yooooo
12:51 AY AY HEY WAIT A SEC *WAIT A SEC*
The storytelling just keeps getting better in this! So happy there's another episode!
First gumbino can back and know you life can’t get any better
Damn, I'm so sad about how charmanders story ended. Here's to hoping the series finale is squirtle getting arceus or dialga or one of the other god pokemon to rewind time and bring him back
When’s the next episode 👁👄👁
well dang i thought this series would never end
Who would’ve guessed torrent is this powerful
I think the next episode charmender will return
Wait..... NOOOOOOOOOOO  CHARSARD
Hey you're back
God finally I've been waiting for this since 100 years ago.. And only 200 more years till the last 2 come out ugh...
sure that Celeb i is going to be forced to time travel squirtle by the way i now like wartortle
Wrong pokemon the last episode it had Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, not Squirtle, Turtwig, and Chimchar.
FINALLY
R.i.p Charmander
12:50 Mewtwo and Missingno still going at it
Wow man loved the episode what an amazing thing that you have created
rIve been here since episode 1 and never in my life did i think things would get this crazy insane, thank you shippidge for your hard work!!!!!!!
Bro Took U Long Enough
Cool
Damn squirtle looks tired...you can see it in his eyes
AYAYYA
Hmm… there’s a lot of snow here… and themes of being forced to commit atrocities… not to mention a dead body frozen in ice…  _Oh no-_    (I’m referring to the Snowgrave route of Deltarune, btw.)
Rip to charmander he died as a warrior
FINALLY
Said the giant god tree WHAT THE FU
Squirtle : お前はもう死んでいる Snow : Nani?! Squirtle : ZA WARDO, ROAD ROLLA DA!!!!!!!!! MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA SUQEO KECA WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
This took a long time but I’m glad u did it
Damn Mewtwo is still fighting missing O
big ups man this shit was insane
i love this episode, i’m just sad that charmander is dead lol
After all this time.
WAIT WHAT 10 YEARS LATER???
Its been years
IT’S FINALLY HERE BOYS
please tell me that blue shell man guy goes 'merica on these fools that call themselves gods by eveolving and putting them guns to gud use.
OMG AFTER AXYEAR
FINALLY YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS
I did not expect things to go the way they did.  To see what happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur...damn.  Kinda makes it hard for me to root for Squirtle considering what he did in episode 9.  Especially considering that cameo battle with Mewtwo...  Regardless, I recognize how much effort and work went into this.  Keep up the amazing work!
I was waiting for so long and it turned out so great
Man Squirtle has been through hell taking orders from a Caterpie who went as a Tyrant Ruler. To later realizing how they messed things up. Squirtle was free losing Charmander his friend that had fought for getting Squirtle back, and Bulbasaur who died on becoming food to the Caterpie Colony. Like Whiskers even realizes that they went too far by ordering Whiskers to kill her best friend while Squirtle is basically a mind slave war machine. By getting stronger and having The Everstone on him. And in another way Squirtle basically let his friends die by the caterpies to watch feast on them. And I get it why he is with a new group. Ten years later at LV. 98 forming a team with Turtwig and Chimchar who basically died in the ice. Turtwig himself left the team because Squirtle was reliving his time when he had his friends which he never had the time to tell them he was sorry for them to die. Squirtle evolved into Warturtle who is LV.99 now finally realizes it wasnt his fault it was the person giving out his actions that did. And with accepting his past he now goes to find the person in charge on top of Snoway Out, trying to fix the wrongs in his life.
Yo, everyone be talkin bout stellar story but no one talkin bout 12:50.
Is this guitar playing adequate? https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwo4iqsr5wzHZig0vISdMOG-rw-CyHNt
Let's go
2 years when episode 9 came out….
WHY WHY WIL U LET CHARMANDAR DIE THATS WAT I A ONLY CARED ABOUT
AHH, it’s finally here :)
This was freaking insane. I loved every second!!
Did any of these voice actors happen to help with the channel, "Dawn somewhere"? Because the bidoofs voices remind me of that channel...
Noooooo charmander!!!!!
Since charmander died Mewtwo might be a big part of the next two episodes considering he was expecting charmander to go to him and we don’t know what happened with that glitch thing (if Mewtwo killed it that is). Also, can you make Wartortle have a flashback during Charmander’s death in the next episode?
I watched the whole thing I now know what happened to charmander hmmm 7:59
This is what I wait for yearly
Also how do you become one of the people who worked on this cause wow you got a lot
Did you have all of this planned right from the beginning?
Its been so long
see you in 6 years when the next episode drops
the ghost
Shippidge uploading is an event at this point also by far the best episode yet it gets better and better
Jesus squirtle has scratches on his shell and bags under his eyes....poor guy
Anyone saw that the leader of the bug had charmander head as a hat. 13:25
waited years for this.... worth it
This video, oml. Good fucking job.
This was soooo epic this was definitley worth the wait and if you need a break be sure to take one. I don't care how long the next one takes its ready when you think it's ready. The amount of work that goes into this is incredible.
Been here for 4 years can't wait too see the rest
Snover is the best character
Finnaly
Alternate title: squirtle learns what ptsd is.
7:21 okay its official! cateripie is vader! lmao
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
I thought this was supposed to be a comedy series I have to get used to this
First of all wtf took you so long
This was worth the wait. That ending has me so stoked and excited for more I can't wait until like a year from now! I've been subscribed and watching these for like forever and they always get with each release, keep up the great content and I'll keep watching and sharing.
Wtf
anyone else notice mewtwo at 12:51
I noticed it looked blurry and checked to see it's only  720P , why only 720p? The previous episodes were 1080p...
I can tell that Squirtle/Wartortle is currently experiencing grief, immediately after charmander's death he experienced shock during the war, and where this episode starts off is while he's still in bargaining trying to replace his old friends and recreate his childhood, now he's between bargaining and anger, channeling his fury into evolving. Next is depression, an old boy do I feel so bad for this poor boi
Out of all the starters I never expected squirtle would evolve first
Amazing. Please tell us the release dates for the final episodes 🙏
MAKE EP 11
when i saw that charmander died i cryed i can't wach these anymore what happensat the end squirtle dies im' leaveing
HES BACK OMG
"if you wont move. Then i will move you!"  "I'll take my problem, and push it somewhere else!"
Thousands of years later, you emerge once again. It was truly worth the wait
*I have been waiting for this moment...*
K bye charmander 😂😂
Nice job it was worth the wait
ITS BACK!!!!
They finally made a new episode
It’s sad that episode 11 will maybe come out after 2 years then there would be the last episode:(
It’s been 2 years…
This series went from haha, cute Pokémon cursing, to a really deep, serious, compelling, emotional roller coaster while still maintaining comedy that doesn’t feel forced. I don’t know how the heck you did it, but please keep doing it.
i am so sad that charmander died :C but this was SOOOOO GOOOODD
OMFG ITS PART 10 IM SO HAPPY THANK YOU :)
Incredible video cant wait for the next part
its been so long
Yes he is back
What happened to Bulbasaur?
At wtf was funny asf
Like charmander said, “the animators get slower and slower every day”
I’m really starting to miss bulbasaur and charmander😞
the ghost
After 2 1 year this man finally posted
Ive been a fan of starter squad from the begining this is such a great series with the animations done perferctly. Cant wait for the finale.
It’s been so long....
Finally we got another episode
0:03-0:07
he seriously trying to fight palkia or Diagla?
He may beat his pb of fastest upload next time.
Holy karp that was some good character development
Finally
I was surprised that the main character is squrtle l, not charmander
勝利 The Caterpie hat says victory or dragon :(
That was insane! The plot the voice change and even maybe the return of character's
YES FINALLY THANK YOU
Finally!!
I feel like squirtle is going to see if he can turn back time and redo what has happened to chatmander and bulbasaur
I just realized squirtle is level 98 which he is only missing two more levels just like he is missing his two friends.
Wow was that missing no and mewtwo
finally after nearly 2 years, glad you're back. but why did charmander (pretty much the main character) have to die, or is it that he can be brought back to life somehow in the future.
WHAT THIS EPISODE TOOK YEARS AND HEN IT FELT LIKE SECONDS
I wonder if Bulbasaur will return.
It’s finally here!!!
I'v waited so long I'm so happy love you guys please heart my comment I love you
I’m so happy
Caterpie hippocrit
Omg I've have been waiting for so long and it's finally here. This video was really good I'm so exited for the finale! :)
I’ll see you all again in 5 years.
I really hope we see bulbasaur again
Theres warturle GO TO MEW AND MEW AND THE OTHER GODS Revie  Charmander AND THE FIRE MONKEY THING
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LETS FLIPPING GOOOO
pls bring charmander back
I waited so long for this and I love it
wow this is verry emotional
If Mewtwo/ missingno don't restore things to how things were before this episode, I'm gonna be pissed!
So no one is gonna ask how did we arrived from Kanto to Sinnoh?  Also how sad the long time it has been passing since they all were gone… Only Squirtle prevailing and trying to fix all that went bad in his life.  Edit: Oh god now we will never know the reason why Mewtwo wanted the trio to go see him…
I was expecting Flareon to jump in out of nowhere and save Charmander, but never thought that Charmander would’ve actually been killed off
When the world needed him most, he came back
dude omg
yo i wasnt expecting this its been so long
the legend is back
What if Charmander isn't dead what if that head was from a different Chamader and the Caterpie was wearing it to get rid of the fear for the other Caterpies and to make the other starters give up on hope
I’m still sad that Charizard is dead
Can you make Charmander come back please where they have three wishes or just add something where Charmander lives
how did this turn from funny pokemon animation to literally god of war
its been..5 thousand years..
He just got wrecked
liked before skipping the ad
Yeah I can't wait for the next one in 10 years yeah
AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY. AINT NO WAY.  In all seriousness, it felt like I was waiting years for this to come out bro. Thank you :)
I started watching this since i was 5 now i am 14
Abamasnow:being slightly bigger changes nothing!  Famous words spoken before death
To think I waited 8 years for this lol
Squirtle becoming the Kratos of Pokémon
Finally its been so long
And then there's my dumb brain thinking that just because Shippedge voiced Charmander, he can't simply be gone...
I really hope wartortle changes into squirtle that voice is very annoying
A wizard is never late, Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
I love this so much, this series is just amazing
It’s finally here. Thank you shippidge, for everything
The ending makes me think of God of War where Kratos is scaling mount Olympus and declare war among the Gods
I wonder if he had all of this in mind since the first episode
What happen to charmander?
yesssss
Wartortle 's Wrath will be on par with that of Asura's
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Well see ya guys in the next 2 years for episode 11
YESSS IT'S FINALLY HERE
I waited years for this
When everyone says Charmander was the main character, while in the first episode Squirtle was actually chosen first over Charmander and Bulbasaur... Don't we all love long term storytelling!
THE RETURN
I love it!
Why does  fearon  keep saying  it s a bird?
This is the spiritual successor to berserk
I neeeeed to know what happens with mewtwo and the glitch 😖
SUPER GLAD ABOUT NEW EP BUT why cliff hanger WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Squirtle is now level 99, and has ditched the Everstone. I hope he becomes a Blastoise next time, and meets Dialga.
YAY!
its about time
Why is Stan Beaker a talking tree?
Finally I have been waiting for years
I remember this series
This is an absolute masterpiece.
Awsome
Damn, charmander didn't evolve 😭
Holy crap new episode   this can only mean  1 thing hell as frozen over
IT HAS ARRIVED
I’ve waited for another episode for so long ty
Im guessing at the top is dialga so squirtle will evolve into blastoise  and beat it and as a reward dialga will send him back in time im thinking dialga will send him back to when charmander burned red to a crisp and became his trainer
It’s been so long
FFFFFIIIINNNNAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally he has done it
Broooooo we back!
One of the best obline series, I am glad that I have been following it for some time now, after seeing the previous chapters again it hits differently
yyyeeeees
Wow
he has ptsd now....
This is awesome!! I totally did not expect this episode to have followed the road of Charmander dying. It's sort of somber and cruel but also, fits so perfectly into the story since it is so refreshing. No plot armour here.   As for the next episodes: I think we are all wondering how Charmander would have ended if he hadn't died. Maybe Dialga/Palkia/Arceus won't be able to restore time to the before, but maybe they can show Squirtle(Wartortle now) what his life could have looked like. Hoping that his death is permanent though lol
i love this Hope more comes and Love your work
yes episode is out
FINNALY ITS BACK!!! I loved this series so much thanks why did it take so long to make the ep.10
THANK YOU GOD THEIR NOT DED
What was it 11 gonna come in
The return of the king
12:50 wtf
Aight Bois let's goooo we only gotta wait another 30 years for the next upload
I have a theory. Wartortle will go up to the mountain and confront the Pokémon god, Mewtwo. They fight and go through time to fix all of the problems that were caused by the Caterpie. 12:50 you can see Metwo fighting something, maybe it’s Wartortle 🤷‍♂️
ITS BACK!!! LETS GO
It’s been so long
See you back in two years!
Im glad yout back and I just finished it THIS WAS AMAZING but sad that charmander die
Will we ever see Charmander again
Literally the best Pokemon show out there. Shits got so metal. Lmfao
Yes. So much yes. This series is awesome, glad it was continued
wait Im dreaming right?
i love it and have waited a long time the one thing i dislike is squirtles new voice
I've waiting for this sicne episode 9,  amazing
I didn't think charmander would actually die but wow I hope he comes back in some way but great video
so. that's it of charmander and bulbasaur then ? 😟😟
I was 8 when this started 😂
Man the snow physicys must have taken a month on it's own
Wat hapen wit charmender
i have a prediction i think near the end well will see charmander evolve to charmeleon   or charizard  and he would say that is is him to wartortle
Nooo charmander
2 years wait worth it
I love Snover they sound like Ron Funches. Delightful little guys. Haha.😂
Aight this is cool but where is bulbasaur? I actually thought he would be the first to evolve lol
dreux ferrano jr sounds like arlo🤔🤷‍♂️
FINALLY but I really liked charmander and bulbasaur
This plot could easily pass for a dark anime if you change the characters into humans...heck, I'd say this is more engaging than any American series I've seen
FINALLY ON TIME! kinda
Squirtle/Wartortle boutta roll some heads
holy shit the prophecy is true episode 10 would happen
Charmander Will Return... Right?
3:50 22:55
Damn. Charmander Die, Squirtle Lived A Living Hell Life, Mewtwo is still fighting the Missing Number, Poor Chimchar and now, a society of gods that life on top of the highest mountain. This Episode, is truly, A LEGENDARY. For Squirtle Just Evolved Into; The God Of WARtortle.
È arrivato, è arrivato. La mia infanzia
Now way I didn't think It was coming back thank you so much
I have not seen this series in so long and it feels great to rewatch
22:18 ¡¡Amazing, Squirtle is evolving a Wartortle!!💗🤩🤩🤩💗
Worth it
alright folks just one more year then we get another episode cya guys in 2022
Such an underwhelming episode. Especially disappointed because of the long wait.
OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Snover: “What are you gonna ask them?”  Wartotle:” Something “
Is this plotagon
when I saw this on my youtube recommend I freaked out good greif I never though this day will come!!!!!!
fantastic work and the story is getting more and more wonderful. Too bad I have to use my dictionary for searching so many unfamiliar words when abamasnow was speaking.
I come to a group Spanish I love you work :3
I’ve been waiting for a while but now I can now see the master piece
all think next will be dialga because time and space was mentioned but it was actualy called "god who created time and space". so i bet on arceus who created time(dialga) and space(palkia)
He died
This is a fucking anime hell yeah
Omg let's go I'm so excited
Thank for making the next episode and time skip holy Pikachu there was so much I missed!     Also good riddance charmander and that Chimchar   And I am happy war turtle evolved finally!!
Oh my god this is amazing  Still good
I'm so happy rn
i love that this episode finaly came! i love it! (One of the best things in it i the snovers (: )
when wartortle evolves into blastoise hes gonna sound like optimus prime
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS!!!
Dang epic
My year is completed best animated series on youtube👏🏻
That was my birthday
on the same day gumbino came back after two years, and we got starter squad episode ten. The world has been too good to us
Shipp, you're a fucking legend
Well I'll be damned, you actually killed Charmander. Now who will Wartortle find at the top of the mountain?
Cool
Plot twister at the top of the mountain charmander and bulbasar get resurcted by giratina dialga palkia and Arceus
When is episode 11 and 12
That feeling when you realize who the main character really was…
*10 years later* Squirtle has level 98 *he's been grinding on level 1s*
WARTORTLE THE GOD
god: WHAT THE FU-
I’ve never been so confused in my life. Genuinely.
Bring back charmander
alv que seinin
Yesterday was eventful because gumbino returned after a 2 year gap and ep 10 of starter squad came :D
AHHHhhHhhHhH finally
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Wow nearly 10 years later and this guy is still making Starter Squad videos. Seriously props to the dedication.
Boy can't wait to see the next...10 YEARS LATER!!! Sh!t got real really fast XD
Amazing!
Yooooooo
Finally
I freaked out when I first saw this on my recommended‘s
Wow, this is so great! ... So when's Green Plant Guy coming out?
now that was so amazing, i cant wit to see how it goes
It was goofy at first but now DDaaaaaammmmmmmnnnnnnnn
:/ i rlly wish charmander
It finally came out it’s been a year but episode 10
This Entire episode gave me How Long is Forever Vibes.  I really hope it goes in the direction its going.  I highly doubt Charmander will Come back. But who am I to judge. Maybe Wartortle will climb the mountain and save his Friends.  Who were lost.
NGL I am sad Charmander died
*This was one hell of an amazing surprise to see*
I Can't Believe I Didn't See Missing No Vs Mewtwo The First Time I Watched This 😂😂😁
Warturtle become Doom Slayer
amazing, when are you going to make the next one
Finally
what happend to charmander
12:50 a little Easter egg 👀👀
This just shows that wartortle is super cool
Soo you hit 90k subs
This is a weird pokemon mystery dungeons bonus episode
O MY GOD ITS HERE
after 2 years...
I didn't see this coming I've put so many people on stater squad and each person loves it cant wait for the next ep
YES FINALLY
One thing I don't like about this is Charmander died but in episode 9 when he got crushed by a boulder he was evolving why did he die I wanted to see more of that
FINALLY I’M SOO GLAD THIS WAS IN MY YOUTUBE FEED LOL GOOD JOB
Finally
Charmander was the best character I miss his voice and how he fought
Fucking amazing!! :-D
Finally after two years
Are all Fire-type Starter Pokemon like Charmander?
it’s HERE this needs to be on the news
Finally, I waited 4000ye-no 5000 years for this!
he kinda seems useless
whos chimchard
do Ep 11
Guys I’m real happy that we finally got a new episode but at the same time I’m sad because this means we have to wait another two years before we get the next one
Imagine if Squirtle reaches the top and a certain legendary/mythical Pokemons gives him a decision to either revive chimchar or Charmander
is mewtwo still waiting for chamander?
OMG LES GOOOO
Rip charmander ;(
Retcon this shit you killed the main character and then skipped to 10 years later wtf
I wanna see how Charmander died
Respect yourself as much as Guy respects himself and everyone around him
but how long for episode 11?
after so long we are here to watch this
me: where part 11     related to the news monke meme
‘
Great! Now to wait another 2 years for Episode 10!
The opening banter *applause*. This was a delight to get back into!
Holy crap! The return of this series got dark. Still, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next. Keep up the great work!
Nice vid finally I've been waiting
I waited until this very episode.  Thanks for the post🤩
This was cool
I wasn't expecting to be slapped in the face with depression upon seeing that ten years later text, gosh that really HURT.  But the storytelling is absolutely fascinating and as someone who's been here since episode 3, I'm so excited to see where this plot goes next!  I have a few theories but I'll keep them in the back of my mind until next time!  :D
Finally :D
Ugh another angry fire starter.
See you guys in 2 years 🙂
And so, a new legend arises.
How is no one talking about 12:51
Been years since I saw the last episode. Hope this continues!
Ngl liked squirtles old voice
Thank you for episode 10 We've waited sooo long ❤ Pleaseeeeeee make more!!!!
It was sooo long but worth it
I started this when I was 7 and now I'm 14 time flies
I’m just waiting for him to get to dialga and dialga to just be insane from knowing both past and future across all timelines
Worth the wait really amazing!
And I told you not to kill him🙄
How ironic Warturtle did the one thing Charmander wanted to do, evolve
Nooooo, I can't wait longer for the next episode
I think what's at the top of the mountain is a gengar that evolved from the gastly that used to be charmader
this is bananas
What do the characters on caterpie's hat read?
Finally
See you in a year
What about Charmander 😭
This series means so much to me. After having watched it for nearly half my life, every new episode is like an event. I can't thank you enough, Shippidge.
Its been years😭
When you'll went live I missed out
This was absolutely awesome. Thank you for putting the effort to continue this beautiful project. Game Freak should hire you to write and make a new Pokémon animation like this. I mean, c'mon, the franchise needs to expand in different horizons and this is a very needed one. Keep up the outstanding job!!!
Okay, the action was awesome, but everything else was a bit disappointing after a two year wait.  Charmander was a great character with great development and you had a great story set up of him meeting Mewtwo and discovering he ruined the world by attacking out of turn and would go on some kind of mission to fix it with Mewtwo in Cerulean Cave, but you straight up threw that in a dumpster. I really hope Wartortly is going to meet Dialga so he can be sent back in time so the events of this episode never happen.  Squirtle was just stuck in the past and trying to relive the old days through Chimchar and Turtwig, who were both underwhelming. Turtwig was just kind of there until he left and Chimchar, again, feels like a knock-off of charmander.  I do love this series, but you REALLY lost the plot with this episode.
Shippidge, you're a frickin Legend of the Starter Squad series!!!💖🤩💖
Cant wait for the next one to come out in 4 years. What happened to mewtwo and missingno tho?
Yo 16 on trending
Easily the bet episode so far, this was well worth the wait!😁
Squirtle will never know that Charmander was trying to rescue him😢
I love the writing for these
I think Episode 11 Might Come out Somewhere at 2023!
i'm hopping that the next ep isn't gonna be that long
FINALLY wonder what took sooooooooooo long
I didn't think Charmander would actually die I wanted him to evolve looks like I'm never gonna see it happened btw WHERE'S BULBASUAR?!
So what happened to bulbasaur?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my god its here after 90000000000 years
So squirtle gained : ptsd  Charmander gained : death but made squirtle reflect on his actions and become like him  Bulbasaur: probably dead  Turtwig: who tf abandones someone?   Chimchar: basically this is starter squad all over again if squirtle never came and piplup was here this would have started so much *WHEEZE*
NUMBER 11 ON TRENDING LET'S GOOO
It's amazing although I do miss charmander  Edit: maybe the pokemon gods are like mewtwo arceus palkia and dialga
Lyle?
THIS IS AWESOME!!!
waited two years for this. Not dissapointed at all
This is a true legend.
Finally it's time to see it years of waiting I still remember when I was little watching this. All I can say it thx
It is finally here I forgot how much I loved starter squad :)
I guess we have to wait for  two more years for the next episode to release
;-; I am sooooooo happy
We have waited so long for this and its finally been given, squirtle has become so powerful, cant wait to see him go all out as blastoise
Beaver society lul
Been waiting for this for like a year now
yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaas
Ive learned that if your a fire type you wont listen to a water type and then you will die
Yes finally! Thank you!
The manga was better
OMG  SERIOUSLY EP 10 IS OUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
Imagine he gets to the top and it's a Pikachu lol
Theory!   He meets daigla goes back in time to stop everything, causes a glitch, becomes missing no that we seen in past episodes  What do yall think?
This Was A Beautiful Return!
Ah yess 28 minutes satisfied me today
If he is this powerful as a wartortle he will be invincible as a blastoise and a god as a mega blastoise
I wish charmander never died
Anyone else really sad that charmander died
The return of the king
Yessssss
I’ve literally went through a whole change of body since the last episode.
Alright can’t wait in two years finally ep 10
I just want to see whats going to happen with missingno
OMG this is maybe the best thing i have watch all year its SO GOOD i can not wait for the last 2 episodes
so cool, i cant wait for the next 2 episodes but it is a shame about charmander, but keep up the amazing work shippidge
the wait was worth it
*holy god*
Rip charmander
Fearow: bird sounds!
I know its not easy to animate. But please give us a date for the next episode.  Your big fan Love you 3000
I have seen EVERY ONE OF THESE THE WEEK OF RELEASE.
Finally...
Omg great it’s finally out it was greatttt but……. Charmander is my favorite starter of all generations so I was really sad when I heard he died, I also love caterpie but I think it’s a little lower in my favorites now…….
Turtwig: "Wait...hold on. So Charmander *ACTUALLY DIED?!"* Squirtle: "Yes." Turtwig: "Like...died died? You didn't jump in and save him?" Squirtle: *Sigh* "I know... I really wish I could've done things differently." Turtwig: "Ah man... What about Bulbasaur?" Squirtle:  "Oh, he didn't want to leave. I think he got the happiest ending out of all of us." Turtwig: "Wow, that's...awful. I don't know why I was laughing so much at the beginning. That story was just a bunch of death and then a really sad ending.  Turtwig's last line of dialogue described my reaction to this episode in a nutshell.   Not only did I get a 10 year time-skip and now have to cope with the loss of *my boy* this episode, we go from hilariously dysfunctional three amigos to rage against the Pokemon heavens... Shippiddge I don't know what you were on when making this episode, but keep doing what your doing!  Also can someone *please* give River Vatae a round of applause or a raise for his Abomasnow voice? That voice just sounds legendary with every word he say!
I was waiting on for like three years for this
What happened to Bulbasaur and why did Charmander have to die?
i waiting forever
I thought Megami33 was Chimchar while watching this😭
LESS GOOO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
misa sad  charmander died he was an OG
It’s Here We Can Now Come Out The Bathroom
This is sick!!!
why charmander why
God this was worth the way
ITS FINALLY HERE BOIIIIIIIIIISSSSSS
*this is trending I see why*
I love the way you made the Snovers 😂
oh bluey
I wish this would continue and Wartortle can befriend a Sobble, Scorebunny, and Grookey, the Galar Starters would be fun travel companions
YASSSS
fin aly squrtle evoled
1- I hope theirs something like he’d be given a choice for a restart . 2-I’m sensing a reference to how you can beat the equivalent to gods in Pokémon if your numbers are high enough. 3-That feels like legitimate character development. Sure he was doing what ever was told to him but he had the choice to do it and now he’s done taking orders. Basically Kratos of Pokémon.
I’ve been following this series for years Man you just kill him off like that wtf man
Holy     shit🤯
sad I really though char was not dead
OMG THAT WAS EMOTIONAL i wish i could be part of this but what am i saying im just one of these thousands of these comments if i could i'll be literally any dog pokemon or anything else
This ain't the last we see of charmander I think. I believe theres gonna be a way to resurrect charmander using those 'gods of gods' big tree guy was talking about. Just a fan-theory tho.
Meh, Chimchar deserved it. I understand Wartortle but hell even Charmander was a better pokemon than the asshole monkey.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Episode 1-9: 😃 😃😃 Episode 10: 😡😵🤗
Aye, Starter Squad is back!
Please, someone get this guy a fully funded crew and equipment. He’s gonna go far.
I want to see squartal die
Come on now I didn’t wait  two years to figure out Charmander died
Oh man, I got chills watching this, can't wait for what comes next. This is awesome!!!!
To be honest I feel so bad for Charmander.
didnt know charmander was a monkey
I love this so much 🤩✌️🥰😘😍😮😯😁🥱😷🐺
Yay I been waiting for ever
“WHAT THE FUH-“  -Abomasnow’s last word
If Game freak or Nintendo Takes this down, There will be riots in the streets. Edit: I feel like that MissingNo is going to be a Final Bossish type of Villain, Considering it was somewhat reoccurring character throughout the Original 9 Episodes.
On my god it has happened
THE WAIT IS FINALLY OVER
no fucking way dude how long have we been waiting
This video just increases my love for Squirtle or would I say « THE LEGENDARY BLUE SHELL MAN GUY »
After being absent in ONE episode, Squirtle finally got his time to shine.
Did anyone notice Mewtwo and Missingno?
Yay :D
I’m sorry what…. Charmander dies  after all this I don’t like that decision….
BRO THIS SHIT CASUALLY COMIN UP IN My RECOMMENDED HOLY SHIT
yo this dope
there needs to be a started squad 1-10 now
FINALY THANK POKEYMON GOD
I wonder if charmander ever made it to cerulean cave since mewtwo wanted him there
Yay
Is anybody else sad that charmander died ;c rip to the best character in my opinion
Wartortle fights arcus confirmed on episode 12 or a shiny bidoof.
This is incredible as always
What are you going to ask the literal gods of Pokémon  Something I don’t know yet but it will be important
Finally
FINALLY EP 10
Yes its been too long. I can finally enjoy life
did you plain for charmander to die or did you change that since in ep 9 the cradits show that caterpea eyes and crossed out but either way that was a shoking twist
Cliffhanger :c
I really hope there a part 11 I are glad you’re doing this and now with a bigger scale too good luck
mewtwo still fighting missing no lol
Squirtle is now the doom slayer
So after so much time ep 10 came
I wonder is he going to time travel back to save Charmander
Yay another episode!
Holy shitttttttttt hes backkkkkkkkk
BRUUUUH I was expecting charamander to evolve or smth it was cool but l wish charamander was the one that evolved
Is that Bibarel drunk? O_o
13:46
im gonna take a wild guess and say missing no is squirtle time traveling after meeting dialga
STICKLE
2 more left
See u guys in 2 years
YES FINALLY EPISODE 10 LETS GOOOOOOOO
so this became Pokemon game of thrones do not get attach to pokemon in this series
15:20 that would be the most PERFECT GIGANTAMAX ABOMASNOW MODEL!!!!😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱
so squirtles a FUCKING GOD now?
What the hell is this?
Yes! Finally something that i don't get bored watching
YESS , MY INSANITY HAS ENDED
Siento que charmander va estar vivo
Imagine not being a patron and not seeing this early. Kinda cringe
Emperical proof Squirtle is the best starter
I've been waiting 2 years for this or 1
- What are you gonna ask? - ... Something.
I'm a bird tweet tweet hilarious
Rip charmander you will always be missed
He's finally back
What the- It came out? Lesss goooooo!!!!!!!
"By the way, this what you look like when you die"   -Haunter, Episode 8
12:51 y’all saw what I saw right ???
finnaly
What a great episode
It's been years since I saw the blue shell
When I saw Chimchar, I thought he was a reincarnation of Charmander
7:57 😨😨😨
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I completely forgot about this series
“when the world needed him the most, he returned”   man I am so happy!!
Bro squirtle really turned into a god
I was going through trending, and saw this. Glad its back
FINALY YESSS
Ok imagine Arceus brings back Charmander when Wartortle is trying to fight Arceus. Then Charmander sees Wartortle gets angry and maybe evolves into Charmeleon then we get something we dont see often Charmeleon vs Wartortle. Its Charmander vs Squirtle or more over Charizard vs Blastoise but never Charmeleon and Wartortle they always get left out.
What happen bulbasaur
kinda wish charmander was still alive
Wi
So what happened to the missingno and visiting Mewtwo in the cerulean cave ? 🤔🤔
YES AFTER 1 YEAR OF WAITING
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally after a year.
Jesus you been workin hard
So did chimchar die or not?  Cause if he did, was blue shell man guy was just carrying around a corpse?   Not very clear.
So whatever happened to all 3 of the starters needing to meet mewtwo at cerulean cave? And idk the whole deal with the missingno 😅
The next episode definetly won’t be out anytime soon, it takes huge ammount of time to make these! If you want to support Shippidge so he can work full time on this instead of having to work a job on top of this, please support him on patreon! You will also receive monthly update on the progress of the next episode, if you have 1$ to spare every month, please consider it!
The Snovers were the best forms of comedic relief.
WHAT YOU KILLED CARMANDER
So wens ep11
Your back let go!!!
Omfg finally
Holy healthy snack rebecca, that was awesome.
2 Left.
Lets go now we can wait another 2 to 3 years for the next one
Watch the pokemon god on the hill be charmander
wow this is sad
yesssss
Omg it’s out
Now we gotta wait another two years for the next installment.
Whow the serie isn't dead O.o
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ITS HERE ITS HERE ITS HERE!!!!!!!!
Did char die???
ITS BACKKKKK
3years????
WHOOOOOO YESS
Dammm
Squirtle turned into master oogway. Literally.
Charmander’s probably now a Gastly stuck in Pokémon tower
Yes
Why did charmander die ;(
Good to see MewTwo still putting up a fight...
NOOOOOO CHARMANDER
YES FINALLLY
I feel like I was just watching a movie
The death of the fire type is an absolute point in time.
20:58 i dont get it, whats he/she (cant remember) talking about? can someone explain
Well I saw char as the protag but since he's dead I guess its all about squirtle
LETS GOOOOOO
WHAT I thought it was over
OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU SHIPPIDGE  THANLKY U+KL"DSJNKSD:F FGOR RELEASING THIOS
I hate that I have to wait another 2 years for the conclusion
nah bro we want charmander back :(
FINALLY I BEEN WAITING
This is literally just Squirtle becoming Kratos
-perfect bidoof appears before chimchar- bidoof...
OML ANOTHER CLIFF HANGER
Wonderful
Well the flashbacks got pretty dark
With deities involved, I have hope for Charmander's resurrection
OOOOH YEA BABY!!!
See you next 2 years
Took you long enough
Yeeeessss a new starter squad vid
Charmander died not being able to tell squirtle the truth
Why
This is awesome.. i hate the wait but been loving this series for years!  More more more! Top work sir.
So there is two episodes left and think the end should be squirtle asking the gods for a redo and then he sent back in time when they're are getting picked by a trainer
Well worth the wait
Yessir
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Just watched it and I cannot believe the turn of events in this episode. Can't wait to see what the final two episodes unfold. Amazing work dude!  Prediction: Wartortle evolves into Blastoise and convinces Dialga to restore the time when Chimchar and Charmander were still alive. Hopefully?
jesus christ this got dark
FINALLLY
If wartortle is so powerful then what is blastoise?
Nice episode bro 👌, missed this series and the concept of squirter trying to relive his past is a thing that just makes me more sad charmander and bulbasaur  are gone in this episode, and squirtle being powerful enough to fight someone who works for the gods and winning gives me some "certain" video game vibes.
YESSSS STARTER SQUAD IS BACKKKKK
I love this episode but I'm mad at the same time Charmander dead no more Charmander
what a twist
I freaked out when I saw "Legend of The Blue Shell Man Guy"
been waiting for this, nice job
It’s about time tough but still YES finally
Yeeeeeeees it’s out!
I've waited... and finally... we got it...
I love the Snovers, yes they are random, but they are the best part of this episode.
YUHHHHHHHHHHHHH FINALLY
Its returned!
Is charmander dead?
'Cold People are no match  for Hot People' That got me die laughing XD
This was an amazing story! I feel bad for Squirtle / wartortile about going through the tragity that he had to face. But now, now he is going to face the actual Pokémon gods! I can’t wait to see what happens next!
Can't wait for the next one in four years
The long awaited arrival of the tenth episode
I hate that’s Charmander died but it is what it is but why is Squirtle Voice so deep When he evolved
It’s been two years dude and…….and I don’t know how I’m not angry
I wonder what would have happened if Charmander won and succeed in getting Squirtle
I think I've figured out what Squirtle's fear is, at least my version anyway: It was mix of blind Faith and breaking the rules.  Let me explain it this way: in the begining, Squirtle was the one trying to put common sense into Charmander with logic and basic facts. It becomes a recurring issue between them. He tries to argue that 'cheating' would only lead to a worse out come, that they'll be better off with an actual trainer.   The thing is, Charmander wasn't wrong either here. As much as followed his story, seen him act in a monsterous way, it did become clear how complacent Pokemon became once captured. As soon as their trainers fled in fear and left behind their own Pokemon, said mon grows scared and begs for mercy.  It in a way is a fight between two different extremes between Squirtle and Charmander. Yet, in the end it ended in concequence. Because Charmander sauht to evolve quickly, he decided to kill as a way to speed it up and saw it as 'the actual fighting way,' which lead to a war being started after killing the wrong Pokemon. If Charmander had obeyed the rules, this probably wouldn't have happened. Squirtle on the other hand, was also in on the conflict. He was complacent on everything, even while it seemed he made his own choices, because he followed most orders given to him.  Squirtle obeyed Charmander's only reluctantly, trying to convince him to not kill anymore, only really stopping when the line was about to be crossed or when it came down to the rules. Then he obeyed the Catierpie leader too in some aspects. Before Charmander was killed, he was reluctant but obedient to them, then stood by when ordered to and watched Charmander die. Then after that basically broke and followed orders blindly, not even caring anymore.  In the end, the conflict went apocalyptic. No one won, and Squirtle was left standing alone in the remains. The weight of what he let himself do and what his blind Faith had done.   This is what I could peice together, but maybe someone could add to it or share their own ideas? I only could peice what I could.
is this rly true am i seeng it right now
The legend has come back, we have needed you
How long did we wait again?
HOLY SHIT I WAS NOT READY FOR THIS❤
Is part 10 the end
Hello
Let's wait two to three more years

Wait…episode 9 was 2 years ago…how did I not notice that
how long until ep 11
Yeeeeeeeesss it’s here after 2 years
It's finally here
YOOOOO ITS BACK
YOOOOOO THAT WAS EPIC
Oh my gosh that was the satisfaction I waited for . really good job the animation and the story writing you guys are awesome and I just can't wait till your next video will come
I love the look in the snow area, especially Snover.  Looks like a holiday Claymation special.
Yes, finally! Why didn't YouTube tell me there was a new one!?
Lowkey hoping for an epic showdown between the eventual Blastoise and Torterra when they meet again, if they do
When the world needed him most he returned
Holy shit this was insane
This is truly the best time to be alive
Omg fimally
I hope a part 11! i miss charmender aleardy! i hope like he call palkia / dialga to go in time to save im! btw its so cool!!

This went full god of war and im ok with it
OMG 2 YEAR I HAVE WAITED
Finally!!!!!!!
you sir are the god!!! thank you for making youtube great. i dont know how hard it is to do this but please continue
I have waited so long for this episode and that I thought that you just stopped makeing it but a am so happy you didint I’m pretty sad tho that chatmander died but who else thinks that char is the re incarnation of charmander and will figure it out once he gets to the top but over all I hope the next the next episode will come out in at least a year and not 10 but the series is great love the work and I’ll be waiting for the next one
After all these years the wait is finally over
FINALLY I HAVE WAITED FOR 30 FUCKING YEARS 30 FUCKING YEARS!!!!!!!!! Jk
This was cool 😎
What if Warturtle goes to the top and they allow to revive Charmander too. I think that would be pretty cool.
i waited 2 years to see charmander is DEAD and bulbisaur gone honistly worth the wait
Yay ep 10 is out
turtwig going over what happened in the 9 previous episodes is literally the most simple yet brilliantly done recap of starter squad
Even though I know it's not going to happen I would really like in the next episode if Squirtle met Bulbasaur and then they team up to get revenge for Charmander and for Chimchar but let's be honest that's not going to happen
yyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss
Shall we see Arceus!
Omg, is there going to be a part 11?
I wonder if Charmander will become charmelon
Nice toon in for 11 2030
Oh cool new video! Well wee see us in 2024.  Jokes side reallly good job in this one. First video was just funny and i never think this will gave a story! And then a deep story too. Keep doing it rake you time but not to long huehuehuehue

womp
Awesome as always!! it was worth the wait!! I also love how even after all this time, we still got Mewtwo fighting missingno at 12:50 .
Whoa did you see Mewtwo? :O 12:45
wait a sec, what hapened with mewtwo
Yesssss
It took you like five years
For episode 11 I hope there’s Charmander
This episode was awesome and well made! I loved the snovers lol they were too funny. Very emotional and passionate. Can’t wait for the next one. Well done shippidge!!
YES I FUCKING MISSED THIS MAN
Nooooooo CHARMANDER WHYYYY,I ALWAYS WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO TURN INTO CHARIZARD
Noooooo Charmander has been killed
Im w8 to see Mewtwo again fighting missigno and see how charmander dies
Episode 10 is finally here and it was definitely worth watching, if this was turned into a real movie I would definitely go see in the theater.
Please make more
when i was 7
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS I THOUGHT YOU WAS DEAD
Chimchar died in his first episode.(I need Bulbasaur and Charmander back ;()
Good episode but its not the same without charmamder
The wait is over
I'll forever be in denial, rip charmander you were my favorite.
FINALLY
I wated 2 years for this
But the bird at the beginning is funny
Earlier today in where I live they had 544k views
Charmander isnt dead btw
POV: It's actually mario
Can’t wait for episode 11
Damn only Squirtle remains. Ok im invested
Rip Charmander 😭😭😭
At 12:56 that was WARTORTLE fighting MEWTWO maybe in the next episode he goes back In time using dialga
I want episode 11
Get a phoenix dew squirtle
Where did Bulbasaur start hitting Charmander I was completely like forgotten stuff about the series I need to rewatch
I have a theory that we're going to see Arceus or Dialga at the top of the mountain. And Wartortle will ask them to go back in time to save Charmander. And the final episode will be the original Starter Squad together again meeting Mewtwo in Cerulean Cave to fight MissingNo.
Very impressive work. I've never been a fan of sudden protagonist switch but it was done really well in this series amazing work.
YOOOOOOO
Finally good content…
Finally I been waiting for this for 2 years
And that god of pokemon is arceus
I've Been Patiently Waiting... THIS WAS WORTH THE WAIT!! Squirtle vs The Gods. I have so many theories on what will happen next now. THANK YOU
11:16
The snovers are f*ckin stupid 😂😂😂
finally yes!
finally yesas
I did not expect a 10 years later storyline.  Also very funny timing to base it in Sinnoh with the remakes coming out.
Hi. I have the silly hobby to recommend fun-stuff and educational-stuff  and a Fusion of both to random Strangers.  Mind if i do?   ..And no... I'm not a bot... many assume that, but most dont even care to test it... or ask...   ...
FINALLY
Holy shit this got 11 on trending!?
I'm so happy the series is back that I could barehanded brutally kill a fearow
R.I.P charmander
Noooo not CHARMANDER
OMG ITS HEREEEEEE THE SERIOUS I WATCHED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
This is probably the darkest and the most depressing episode in the series so far but it was worth waiting 2 years for it
omg I been waiting for this forever
Can you please bring back charmander i just watched the whole series again iam still crying after charmander was stabbed by caterpie
So Wartortle is the new Kratos
time to wait 2 years for episode 11
Wait, they killed charmander?
Thanks for the amazing 10 episodes. These have all been worth the wait. I flipped my shit when I saw this new episode in my recommendations.  Fantastic job as always Shippage. 💙 💙 💙 totally epic af.
As the old saying goes "Good things come to those who wait."  Though, I do feel bad for Squirtle though.  Edit: At least Bulbasaur's doing okay.
If kratos was a turtle
I swear i don't even have any interest in pokemon any more and the fight was by far one of the best I've seen
Nooo charmander
Please make the next one faster slowpoke
Omg YOOOOOO ITS HERE
My head cannon is that Whiskers doesn't die, but somehow survives. I believe in her!
So happy episode 10 is here it really was worth the wait
2 years and we finally get a new episode
YESS
Now you finally make and its GOOOOOD
YES
W-wait charmander is dead
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Good thing, you keep Squirtle in Lvl.98. Otherwise, he would stuck as a Squirtle forever
Damm this was a heart wrecker. But god damn was it amazing
Its been 2 years
Woah I’m late
Finally what’s been taking so long !!!
FINALLY HERE LETS GO
I Love this series and am glad that I finally got to see episode 10 and can't wait to see what comes next. I also want to say that Chimchar is similar to Charmander when they started out their personalities are almost the same so maybe Squirtle thought he should take care of Chimchar so what happened to Charmander wouldn't happen to Chimchar, but he did end up dying too and I'm still upset that Charmander died because he really was changing for the better.
Everytime the Snovers talk it makes me laugh 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂
What game is this?
i cant wait for 11
When they needed him most, he came back
I have been waiting for 4- No... 5000 Years for this..
Oh! I get it now...the ten years of waiting was to make us truly feel the time skip...Shipp you sneaky son of a Quagsire 😜😂
16:08 I love how if you put on the subtitles, you can see he said “Arceus” in the literal Japanese way
nooo squirtle is the only guy whyyy charmander die! ):::::
No. F*cking. Way.
This episode is so emotional! Charmander's death is really shocking and hurting ☹ I wonder what happened to Bulbasaur.
Cool can’t wait for the next update of episode
Amen
Finally! A very happy birthday to me!!
FINALLY ITS BEEN SO LONG
So charmander
This video was badass
Broke me knowing Charmander is actually dead I hope this is the right choice for the story at least bring back bulbasaur thank you for your hard work see you in 2 years.
I love snover he is so funny and i want to see more of him also you are talented for making this awsome vid.
idea for 13 mewtwo vs  wartorteril
Stop making us wait dude for more than 3 years or more dude like why
O….M….G THATS AWESOME
Finally my suffering has ended and It was worth it
We are in universe gamma-6290 we finally managed to find episode 10.
Plz make more there good
12:50 Sooooo are we just gonna ignore mewto in the background
Everyone else has been waiting for the year to end but I been waiting for this
This one was deep and fantastic
NOOOOO HOW DARE SQUIRTLE KILL CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Me:after 2 years, I finally can watch it!
cool
Damn charmander really died but i loved this episode
Ascending the Snow Path with the corpse of your fallen friend, with a glowing aura of Super turtle goodness
Nothing brings as much joy as watching this series.
i liked the story but changing the charekters was a little unexspectet i felt that charmander an bulbasaer were the best charecterss in the first 9 ep. i hope we are gonna see a little more to the mewtwo fighting the gliched pokemon. and what about cerulean cave where mewtwo should wait for charmander. the new animation was a little hard to get used to and if u can pls build more to this or make other ending i like to see the originel story evolve. maybe charmander get saved and they go on to solve the glithc thing and train while doing that.  sorry for the critic i could be the only on feeling this way. and you probebly got something in store to us when he meets the so call pokemon gods.
Is charmander dead?
finally
Finally episode 10
Worth the wait man. It was amazing. I’m a little sad tho that charmander is dead.
Fearow is a bird
8/10 ep. it was good for what it was but Charmander dying I don’t think was the right call
When the World needed him the most he Returned
I miss charmander and squirtle and bulbosaur
About time!
We wait 1 year for this i dont want to wait another year for another masterpis
I wouldn't watch this if I were suffering form actual PTSD. Or I would. I dunno. I never went to war.
ive never been more entertained by something in my entire life
I love how meaningful yet hilarious this series is, it's truly been a ride watching this series.
Peak Cinema
360 kick 2:23
No Wnoder This Took So Long, Animation Quality Said " E X P A N D  D O N G"
Amazing 👌 I was nervous when you mentioned you thought a lot of people wouldn't like this episode, but this was great!
Time to wait for 4 more years
HOLY SHITT THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME
Someone tell me most fire types die
FinallY let’s GO waited so long
Did noone notice mewtwo fighting the glitch in the flashback. What happened with that. Will it come by near or during the final encounter
12:49 0.25x speed
Charmander is DEAD 💀 I 😱 I didn’t realize what was caterpi was wearing on his head
I bet you  all those dislikes are because of charmander being dead
Great episode. Now time to wait another 2 years
Finally!
2 more eposiodes I have my predictions.... THAT WE ARE THE GODS
What's the music for: 24:15
ALFIN SALIO
when next episode (hope not 1 year later)
As soon as possible make at least one more Please
I’ll gladly wait 2 more years if this is the level of story we’re getting 🤘
After years, we got em
squirtle is level 98 specifically since he saves two levels for 2 evolutions
Also ice is weak to water
Oh yeah! That’s what we’ve been waiting for!
Finally
Oh my god that was so good
Wartortle went into the freaking avatar state lol
Episode 11?
Can we get weekly uploads? 👀
I just can’t unsee chimchar being caterpie
It is sad charmmader is dead
Blueshellman vs the Gods eps11 hahahah
Bro what's up with pure fire type Pokemon being big jerks
Pant
I never pick you Squirtle hate you for killing my favorite Pokémon
FinAllY
Plz do it pt 11
What can we the fan do financially to expedite the next episode. I can’t keep waiting every two years lol
FINALLY
Finally a new one
After 1 year :v

OMFG. I’ve been waiting for this shit
THE TRUE KING HAS RETURNED!
finally
GIVE EM SHELL!
YESSSS
:D
whens the next one best youtube seireis j
“I’m A Bird!!!!! TWEET TWEET!!!”
Took him long enough
Why does it take so long
YES YES YES YES YES
FINIALLLLYYYY THIS TOOK WAY TOO LONG I.
This is definitely not what I expected, but hell, now I want to see the next episode! Except, it might take a couple more years before we get it, so let's just stand still, silently, till the next episode comes out. Waiting. Waaaiting.
If you think he took to long give him a break 3D animation and lip syncing is really hard
Cool and i think at the top there will be arceus or mewto and i am a pokemon go player
Holy god! Episode 10?! We’ve all been waiting for this moment for years! I actually have to rewatch the others before I start on this one. I’ll be back!  Edit: Wtf?! When did this become so lore heavy and awesome?!?! Hell yeah!!!
He sounds so badass as wartortle. I can’t even imagine what he’ll sound like as blastoise.
This is just like a nuzlocke you faint you die
Chimchar is a wish version of charmander
R.I.P charmander
Awesome, but if Charmander is legit dead dead as in they won't be reviving him or anything, I'mma be pissed.
Well we just have wait 2 or more years for the sequel or a prequel
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Yes
Low key I was expecting the Abominasnow to actually be Haunter. Abom’s VA had me in chills.
12:50 lol
Do you think squirtel will also tell the gods to revive charmander and chimchar
Finally
Holy fk this series is better than all the pokémon series combined
Glad to see this I watched this when I was 7
FINALY AFTER YEARS AND YEARS
HE DIES?????
This was absolutely fanstastic. I didn't exepct such a shift in the story but I love it as I feel so bad for squartle and everything that has happeend. I wonder if we we will meet carterpie again. Also just want to say the other parts were amazing as well. The animation (loved the snow's model), the music (loved the music 24:20 and could someone tell me the name if it has been released?) and the voice acting (again snow was really well done, the voice was perfect).
In episode 11 I bet that charmander will be at the top of the mountain.
HOLY SHIT No way my guy finally released it boys the wait is over holy freak And its a banger too
Its been ages since I’ve watched one of these
I honestly am upset charmander is dead and bulbasaur for all we truly know is either dead or probably a Venusaur by now. I like bulbasaur the most and seeing squirtle/Wartortle without him breaks my heart
Holy fucking shit this series took a turn.
time to wait another year
Incredible. I have been waiting for a long time like a year and some more but this animation,voicing, and the work put into this is amazing. Thank you for the animation.
Ep. 11 The Gods
I hope next episode charmander makes an appearances a charizard
All the fire types in the series besides fleryon died
10/10 episode
I CANT BELIEVE IT Edit: Hold on, it’s been 2 years?!
I've been waiting....
I m upset because of the death of chamander, it was a good character development in the series
What is written on the back of Charmander's head?
I've never dropped everything else I was doing so quickly
BUINISIMOOOOO CARAJO BUENISIMOOOOOOOOOO JAJAAJ y eso que los demas estan perdidos o muertos PERO BUEN RECOMIENZO BUENISIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2 episodes left....
o damm
It was kinda sad to know that Charmander died but it builds up Squirtle's character
How did wartortle do that to a grass type-
See you guys in 2023 for Episode 11
I’ve never been so happy for episode 10 of something
I miss charmander
I am sad for charmender's death 😿😭
FINALLY THE WAIT IS DONE WOOOOOOOOOO
did charmNDER actually die?
13:38 yea all the life in Squirtle eyes are completely gone in this scene
Hm. I’m not sure how I feel about Charmander dying. Where is the plot going to go from here?
finallyyyy😭
o
I'm a BIIIIIIIIRD TWEET TWEET
Wait a minute… WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT MEWTWO AND THE MISSINGNO THING, CHARMANDER WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO CERULEAN CAVE TO FIX IT.  Can I get an explanation about this? Will it be something for the future?
welp that was a sad ending
I loved this episode possibly my favourite but I don’t really like the design of chimchar
this was so sad for something based on pokemon XD. Great job nontheless
0 this is what I hope happens with the series this is only what I hope happens if somehow they bring Charmander back but I don't think they will when Wartortle goes up to see the gods and defeats them maybe they can bring back Chimchar and Charmander but I don't know that's what I hope happens cuz I would be damn exciting to walk Wartortle white Arceus or something be awesome that's just what I hope happens
man nice Protagonist shift
This is like Infinity War
Epic
YES
Wow. Insane. Incredible. The Wait did not disappoint. This is for Pablo.
Rip charmander
Woaa
👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
I want the lizard back
Omg this is so cool ^^❤❤❤ Great job
Its finally here... my little brother and me... we was waiting for this
I... am speechless. Thank you for this.
geee another fire starter that is a jerk X3
yessssssssssss
https://youtu.be/DFC9ZB1ot6I 🥂
No frickin way my guy
Holy shit I was not expecting this
See you guys again after 2 or more years if we still alive
Poggers
Finally,  i can watch the episode 10! Thank you very much!
FINALLY
Bruh i watch this so many times just for the Snovers lmao i love them
I wonder how a conversation between Charmander and Chimchar would go.  Would’ve been fun to see those two interact.
10 years,and Squirtle did not even evolve ? 😬
you dont how much I waited
Niiice it's great Hope the story continues
PLEASE MOOOORRRREEEE
I love that he uploaded starter squad I miss charmander and bolbasour
see you next year...
When I saw that idiot worm wearing Charmander head I was heart broken
Omg it is here
I knew that squirtle would evolve at some point
Nooooooooooooooo if he goes to the top of the Mountain he can wish to redo every thing right
NOOO charmder he was my favorite
Charmander! Noooo!!! But go Squirtle! Excellent story and worth the wait, though I'm going to miss Charmander. He was always my favorite, in game and in this series.
One or two years
When squirtle evolve to wartortle whats the music name for it
rip charmander and char and maybe bulbasaur
Ep 9 is the worst my favorite boy charmander died I wanted to see him evolve 😭😭😭
Second time rewatching and forgot all about the missingno mewtwo fight
This episode was SO COOL but I just got one question. Are they exploring the Sinnoh region now? It seems like it, because that tall mountain might be Mt. Coronet, Sinnoh Pokémon appear in this episode, and one of the Pokémon gods could be Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, or Arceus.
We only got 28 minutes and you decided hey what’s ended on a cliffhanger
OMG SO LONG THANK YOU
Sure this was amazing but you didn’t have to end it on a cliffhanger
I'm mad how good this is.
We have been waiting one year and we get a cliffhanger
I have a theory we might see charmander again let me explain so in episode 8 we learn that when Pokémon die they become a gastly instead of going to the afterlife so there is a chance that we will see charmander as a gastly but this is just a theory plus there are just two episodes left so it’s unlikely
it's only been 2 years! now we get to wait another year!
0/10 charmander didnt return sadge
Yes it’s out
The long wait is finally over, Thank you so much for making this masterpiece for us.
After 2 years its finally here
Yayyyyyyy
Great now ep11
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MEETING MEWTWO AT CERULEAN CITY?!?!?!?!
I am actually so sad Charmander died, His death was extremely impactful and heartbreaking especially when I watch this episode (10) and rewatch episode 9. This really shows how even the most difficult people can change but nobody will want to notice it, they will still think of that person as that old version of them. Charmander's death has sincerely touched my heart, Rest In Peace To A Real One! D;
cya in 2 years
This is so smooth and good
HE HAS RETURNED
YK HOWVLONG IVE BEEN WAITING?
AH
Ep 11
So is charmander dead or are you going to bring him back in the next episode like have arceus or mewtwo bring back charmander?
Loving this reboot of God of War
FINALLY Also what do the markings say on charmanders severed head at 7:14

Finally

Finaly its back
Did anyone else see the glitch thing around 12:50 to 12:56
I remember watching this series we a kid. Time sure does fly.
The longer episodes are definitely worth the wait!! 🙌
the best pokemon movie 5 out of 5
More episodes

WAIT.. WHAT?!

Finally
Fucking amazing. I'm excited for 11
Finally let's goo
12:51 I forgot about mewtwo...
YOOOO FINALLY ITS OUT
1:38 "I am not enjoying being kicked anymore!"  "I am... But I recognize that's an unhealthy lifestyle"   Lmao
SRSLY MAN ITS SO AMAZING BUT I HOPE THE NEXT EPISODE WONT TAKE LIKE 6 MONTHS TO COME OUT PLS
THEY'RE BAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCKKKJKKK!!!!!!!!!!!
see you all in another 2 years or more maybe cause I guess these things really are still increasing in length
I've been waiting for this for 1,000 years it's finally here and it looks amazing
It is back!!
OmL
I think it was great but I’m still kinda bummed out the original story was scrapped and killed off charmander.
Welcome back Legend!
Now we wait 2 more years…
IT TOOK LIKE 2 YEARS FOR THIS IT BETTER BE GOOD
WAIT WHAT ABOUT 10 11 12  AND YOURNOT EVEN TELLING US WHY UR SO LATE WHY YOU TOOK ONE YEAR TO MAKE THIS
A new episode every year, what a legendary series
Half an hour animation goddam I understand why it took so long.
I love that one of the snovers just swap out with another one on the way and nobody acknowledges it
this was the best birthday present I could ever ask for!
I waited for my who life for this
Finaly
FINNALLLY!!!
Since when is Squirtle a shiny?
O Wartortle mais foda que eu já vi
so charmander is dead
Wow it’s a Dynamax Abomasnow!!!!!
For a second I thought you died
neeext
This was epic
Well just like what charmander said “so much character development.” but who knows based the final part of the video maybe squidle or warturtle will fight the gods and convince them to bring back the monkey and charmander to life. I’m mearly guessing
Finally!!!!
i hope squirtle dies
BRO WHY IS TURTWIG SAYING WHATEVERS ON MY MIND
It's been 3000 years...                (Btw if anyone says that I copied just remember I wrote this as soon as clicked on the video.)
The caterpie has to be my least favorite character of all time.
Its a shame charmander died he was my favourite
Squirtle is a lv.98 !?!? Bruh hes really been training
WAIT OMG HE ACTUALLY UPLOADED ANOTHER EPISODE OF THE SERIES THANK YOU SO MUCH
This story is amazing, and I respect your story. But I actually wait so long mainly for charmander, and then you let it die... I hope you could somehow bring charmander back.
Oh cool what are you gunna ask? Something.
Im gonna really feel like bulbasaur is behind all of this, or it could be weddle(beedrill)
I can't believe it's over and Charmander is dead.
Also THAT SQUIRTLE EVOLUTION WAS REALLY COOL
FINNAlY
I felt bad for Squirtle during the flashbacks, and when he evolved he literally turned into a god. I think this was the best one so far.
Hope the Missingno Plot comes back eventually
12:50 how did they not hear mewtwo or the glitch?
Poor charmander and bulbasaur
This series hooks me up so much, I wonder why there are these long delays between each of this episodes? I can't wait for the next two episodes, Also it takes so long to come that I lose track of what's happening. I'm already hyped and can't stay patient for the next one.
Squirtle suddenly got plot armor made the big tree confuse
"What are you going to ask them" "Something" NGL, for an action movie one-liner that going to rank pretty high for me.
*Anime storyline intensifies*
I was sad when caterpie was wearing charmanders head
Time to wait another millennium for the next episode, see you when the earth dies and crumbles, bye.
FINALLY
Amazing work!
Damn, the Caterpie razed Kanto.
It sucks that charmander is dead but I’m glad Squirtle evolved into wartortle
I'm so glad ep 10 is up, aww this is pretty depressing but hey bluey finally decided to change for the better
Finally
Wow he got strong
It’s not over
The End Is Finally Here
Took 1 year to get released wish it got released earlier ☹️
finally
FUCK YES
Best youtube show EVER!
Right at the first scene I already hate it but love it at the same time
finallyyy
The animation’s leveled up
LESSS GOOOOOO
Let’s hecking go
Okay guys that was a great episode.   Now to wait another year.
This is awful wtf
LEONARD! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I know this is animated.. BUT I FEEL SO BAD FOR SQUIRTLE!! FIRST HE SAW CHARMANDER DIE IN FRONT OF HIM AFTER REALISING HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM AND FELT LIFELESS OR SAD WHEN HE GETS A FLASHBACK.
is this... the end?
All these episodes now it’s finally here
Caterpie : Tell me there's a way to make this right  Squirtle : there's a way to make this right   LMAO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ITS FINALLY HERE
I love your animation you didi great job
So charmderdied
So charm Anderson died
Yes it is finished
I'm so glad this series came back
EPIK PLOT TEISTS 😨
HE IS FINALLY BACK
Squirtle bring back Charmander too.
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Kill caterpy
No sane person would kill of their protagonist! it's probably going to be some dialga shit and whatever
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHY THE HELL CHARRMANDER GOD THIS IS JUST A DARK STORYLINE
this is not the end right isnt there 2 more I hope he revives charmander or something
AFTER YEARS OF WAITING ITS FINALLY OUT BOIIS
Make your profile pic Slowbro
What if in the last episode sqirtle finds a celibi and gose back in time to save charmander
final fucking e
FINALLY AFTER 1 YEAR ITS BACK
oh my god after years
Yay! New episode! ^.=.^Will put it on my Watch later list and see it once I have time!
Im so happy
i wonder if the homie gonna evolve in blastoise since he was level 98
FINALLY!
I heard what the fuc
Y’know I never thought I’d be thinking a Wartortle is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen but clearly I was a fool
ttt
very good waiting on ep 11
I stopped whatever I was doing. This is my life 👌
After Caterpie was told not to do all this he didn't listen and now karma came back to haunt him horribly.
wait a min if charmander killed one pokemon it got stuck in a dimension as a pokemon spirit that is trying to escape if he said he will escape he may enter a body of a already dead pokemon like him that means for my calculations charmander may get revive and come  back to life that's what i think for now but idk.
Finally woo!
:V ohmy it took so lonnnng
No cap I think the god at the top of the mountain is finna be caterpie
This…. Is acceptable
Literally 3 days ago I checked if they posted. Video guess I’m early
Man, that war stuff really gave Squirtle (now Wartortle) PTSD, not just that but the loss of his partner charmander. The caterpie leader really took things too far and lost most of his comrades. I liked of how Shippede added a couple of the Sinnoh starters, chimchar and turtwig, chimchar is my favorite starter. Chimchar was even as stubborn as charmander was taking risks like that.
defo worth the wait
Amazing
My favorite series in the world
12:51 you see mewtwo fighting hitmonchan again, how hasn’t he sealed with him yet
Am I dreaming ?
Now plz do 11 12 and 13 bc now it's getting cooler and cooler
Woow the wait was real can't wait for the last episode
Does anyone else think that stone Squirtle has was given by mewtwo to bring back charmander ? Because Squirtle seems both obsessed to save the fire monkey and keeping that stone necklace .
YES ITS HERE!
Finally!!
Wow the perfect early birthday gift 🎁 thank you 🙏🏽
[If you're looking at the comments before finishing, spoilers, also speculation]  Well, stuff got extra messed up really quickly; Sad to see the starter quad end in such a bleak note, specially with how charmander was my favourite character, but total respect for the bold move. It's interesting see how squirtle both grew up, but at the same time ended up getting some of charmander's personality in this obsession of trying to relive the past (forced friendship, beating up random bidoof instead of his classic "let's solve this peacefully").  With how "damn you, sad time" the story has been now, I don't think we'll get an actual good good ending of squirtle (whatever) going back to save charmander, but the chance to say a last goodbye, quenching some of his regret, saving and saying sorry to chimchar instead, and then finally moving on, maybe even helping mewtwo in tying up the missingno. thing from a long time ago. (also, what happened with piplup? did squirtle do something to piplup so he could be with the gen4 starters!?)  Now it's time to wait another 3,000 years for the next episode yay (smile cry emoji)
Man Imma need to rewatch the 1-9 episode coz I cant really remember them lol Its hard to really understand the real plot lmao
Aaa it's awesome but is other episode coming soon or comming late like this episode 😅
bro this is actually sad the fact that charmander is dead, bulbasaur left squirtle, and squirtle is depressed
Ive waited years for this not disappointed just happy
Anyone else notice Mewtwo right around the middle?
Woah, puberty hit Squirtle hard..
your need! to retun the charmnder and bulbusar NEED!
YESSSSSS FINALY!!! MY DAY IS MADE
FINALLY, YES
What the f…. Hahah
Tf did I watch
Finally.
More plssssssssssss
When we needed them most they returned.
My life is now complete
did some call god of war blue shell is god of war
Keep up the good work on your videos

F For Charmander Wartortle Better Give Those Gods A Lesson.

What happened to Bulbasaur?
Sooooo when ep 11 coming?

Art can't be rushed
I wanna see more of snover
9 Years in making I swear to god i actually cant wait for the next episode its gonna take another year or two i hope squirtle asks one of the pokemon gods if he can turn back time so he can change his past
Finally
let me guess, charizard or venisuar is going to be at the top.
I’m getting kratos vibes for some reason?😂
Finally man
Bruh how is squirtle still squirtle he's freaking level 98
I LOST ALL HOPE BUT YOU CAMR BACK
FINALLY YESSSS
Alr time to wait another year for episode 11.Idk if it's gonna take that long but I'm gonna be honest It might
Yes fainnally part 10
the fact that the two startes escaped, means that some sick fuck decided to choose piplup as their starter
12:46 anyway mewtwo and the glitched pokemon is fighting just wait for a moment  Pay attention
Alright,see yall for the next episode in 3-4 business years
the return of a legendary series...                           OK time to binge all the episodes again
Would you rather see episode 11 or have 99M subscribers  (Comments below)
This should be a tv show it’s amazing
Hey i requested 1 blastoiste
2 episodes left
2 years of desperation and it's finally out. The plot for this was amazing and the music was next level. Episode 11 and 12 are gonna take so long. My predictions are that Wartortle might find Arceus at the top and revive Charmander. This is amazing and I can't wait for the last 2 episodes.
And is that sinnoh reg
im so hyped for episode 11
It’s happened! It’s happened!
I don't really like it without charmender

After like 5 years your done
you and all of us gave come a long way since 8 years ago when i found youre chanle now im crying remembering the first episode and the first time i watched it when it came out
Figured it out! Chimpchar ate the catwrpie and that is why squirtal  is loyal
Lol Teh Ice Giant No I Won’t Say It 😂😂😂
See you all in about One year
I STARTED CRYING WHEN I SAW THIS IS THE END OF A SERIES THATS BEEN GOINHG ON FO YEARS AND BEEN A PART OF ME
This bring so much memories
Where's charmander and bulbasaur?
Yes it’s back baby
I like that finally after 2 years it's back. and it was so good but I really miss charmander
I waited so long and was not disappointed!! It was a fantastic episode, so heart broken over it but it was fantastic. Going to be a long, brutal wait to the next episode! Looking forward to it :D
And balbasuar
Wow he suddenly jumped 3 seasons in 1 ep. Lol
Well guess I’ll see you in a year or 2 or a decade or a century jk Ik how long it takes to make these
Where is charmander
Now where is episode 11? XD
anime training ark????
theory: charmander becomes a haunter/gastly and confronts squirtle at the peak of the mountain (probably a dumb theory)
Bro first Video game house 5, now this?!? Blessed 😭😭😭
What a treat!!! A new episode airing on my birthday!
That was That was awesome 😍
finally after 1 year
Finally after waitin for long time
Damn I didn't think he was gonna kill charmander Im gonna unsubscribe from Shippidege I will watch the series but the fact he killed my favorite character just doesn't feel good anymore and the main character is Squrtile the worst starter of all I would've been fine if Bulbasaur was the main character
Great episode! I hope Wartortle takes a new Charmander and Bulbasaur under his wing later on 😀
This is amazing! The quality of voice acting and animation, the runtime, the crew, and so much more has changed over the episodes. This is the definition of “Animation takes time.” I’m excited to see what happens next! I’ve been here since the very beginning on different accounts and it has been amazing to see the series grow.
Holy fucking shit
12:51 mewtwo
it was worth the wait!
I was disappointed
No words for animation but how charmander died and balbasur is missing story has been little disappointing
RIP Charmander
This is so well done. I'm impressed how far this came. Welp! See you all in 2 more years!
Abomasnow:BEING A LITTLE BIGGER  WONT SAVE YOU!!  Squirtle:who decided that.  Escanor in heaven:A new generation has come.
Is charmader really dead i mean he just want squirtle back
recarinate charmander
Yay fiannly
It’s finally here
Lol I love the “talking tree”
Wait so charmander will never come back :(
Japanese moment lol
FINNALY
Cant wait for episode 11 in a year
I'm calling it: wartortle (bluey, shell man guy whatever you want to call him) will meet dialga and go back in time to stop evil Caterpie and save Charmander and Bulbasaur. Why else is this in sinnoh? Edit: holy crap I didn't expect this many likes
finally SO COOOL
Squirtle: normal voice Wartortle: Batman
The wait was so long
I miss charmandar
I love the snovers
OH MY GOD CATERPIE IS WHEREING CHARMANDAR HEAD
I wasn’t expecting a continuation of this but no doubt this was a great continuation. From starting out as a one off thing of the starter squad, to a very cohesive narrative driven story and even symbolizing change just like how the narrative changed with this episode
he deserves 5 mil subs no really
Damn I remember when this series first came out. It’s been a cool progression. Great job!
omg finally it's here!
i dont believe charmander and chimchar are dead. nope.
Wow it felt like 10 years XD
Nooo two gone....
The bidoof in the beaver society seem kinda nice
One of the scariest thoughts is the fact that missingno. wasn’t the biggest threat during squirtle’s flashbacks
Episode 11 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Love the Story telling and thank you  Great video
I like that in this episode bulbasaur becomes a new person and becomes violent.
YES IVE BEEN WAITING

Pokémon is the best
What happened to the mewtwo plot ?
That Is Better than i could ever expect, i immagined a classic last episode and i got this masterpiece
Squirtle: pure depression Bulbasaur: minding his own business Charmander: …..
I can't wait to wait for 2 more years
It ain’t even starter squad anymore now it’s just starter
Yea finnaly
This was definitely worth the wait, holy shit this is amazing 👏🏼
Holy shit this is happening.
One more to go?
The god is red
What the fuck? This came out of nowhere, but congrats!!!!
The long wait is over,yes FINALLY      Also.....  Pin?

The wait was worth it
I thought you were dead?
Why took so long🤔
finnaly squirtle evolved
Brevers
How did I miss this? Damn Notifications
It's been 88 years...
Can you bring charmander back to the deserve a second chance? :(
*shouts for 10 hours because my favorite starter died*
AYYYYYY TSMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
POGg
my fav part is abomasnow
too easy
WHAT  THE FUC-- "BOOOOM!!AHHAAHHAHA" THE MEMES xD
LETS FUCKING GO SHIPPIDDGE
Bruh, Squirtle is a big hypocrite, he got Charmander killed because he took "innocent" lives while Squirtle did the same thing to fearow and others for no reason. :/
Can’t believe charmander died I thought he would be in critical condition not die
I think that mountain is MT silver and red is there  And Charmander is probably ghastly (Haunter said you will become ghastly when you die) and Mewtwo gonna revive charmander probably
After all these years…
It’s finally here
Woah woah woah This has took such a turn O-O
OMG
now 11 would take time to
Finaly ep 10.But charecter/Charzar  died
The return of the king
I’m so happy to see this again

If I were to describe The ending: *Testosterone*
Episode 11 eta? Like 2 years? 6 months. We don't care. We just need to know.
man kinda bum out about Charmander dying but yeah the wait was worth it hopefully they revive back Charmander doe
Squirtle evolved into Wartortle! *God of War intensifies*
gasp  the return!
Dear shipp  You are amazing 👏
Let’s go waited over a year let’s goo

Holy shit

Omg
The Kingdom of God is at Hand  John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
How people pronounce:arecues  Games:Aresues Anime:arkeus Mike:arkoos  This guy:areususu
😥 sad
More more pls more
amazing
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well... see you in 2023 for the next part...
Never expected this nice
I hope that that glitched punchy dude touches squitle and goes back in time and saves him
What with the mewtwo in 12:51 ?
I love the Fearow's lines way too much. Totally using that as a notification sound.
Ladies and gentle men the wait is over we finally got what we wanted! Thank you so much for this episode
I feel like squirtle originally got the everstone for the reason he claimed, to get better moves. However, it slowly reminded him about charmander, and how he always wanted to evolve. He kept it on as a sign of respect, but still says it’s for better moves.
It’s here
hm doesnt feel like the ending tho, there will be continuity of this isnt? really awesome story and animation
Snover is now my favorite character.
I hope you have 11-12 being worked on in the long break  I know animating is hard but you got this
God of war wartortle I get the reference;)
Honestly amazing story. This episode was a great one. But one thing that bothers me is how Charmander is just dead and they casually brush over it, moving onto Char. I understand Squirtle’s grief, but we never really see him progress and meet Chimchar and Bulbas- I mean Twiggy. And what happened between it. Possibly later on we may get this exposition, but with Squirtle’s character arc hitting the gas, I dunno.
NOOO WAY LETS GOOO
I am a very disappointed at the unceremonious death of Charmander.
OH MY GOD!!!
Yes finally
Yes finally
Well see you guys in 2024 when the next ep comes out
they had the BALLS TO KILL CHARMANDER and leave behind bulbasaur  seriously they had more balls then killing Marcy in amphibia.
My mans got ptsd 😭, also Rest In Peace charmander
The liserd
It's ironic, in the end, it was Squirtle who evolved first also everybody loves Bibarel
Where’s charmander  and bulbasaur
Finally the long wait is over...........
The talk about Choice made me think about Dinobot from Beast Wars.
Yeess finnally
F to pay respects for Charmander, I’ll never stop crying in bed
Been watching this since 2015, the first time I watched this was when episodes 1-6 or something came out and me and my best friend watched it, this was when I lived in Kansas. Then in 2018 I moved to the east coast that’s when I watched 1-9 and had tons of flashbacks to the memories me and my best friend had watching this, this was truly a master piece.
Yay
Bro this reinstalled my fear of forgetting someone’s name
Finally, it came
I would say "this is cashing in pn bdsp" if I didn't think this narrative was planned for a while
Just remember this all started because charmander stabbed a catterpie
The fact that this man brought back my childhood is 👌
2 left
What's the end credits music?
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY
I’m hoping secretly Charmander is still alive and that bulbasaur is now chillin somewhere at max level as a venusaur as a wise guru or that him and charmander have been traveling together
FINALY
So Charmander did die
Wait so Charmander wasn't able to meet up with Mewtwo. I wanted to know what he was gonna tell him :(
Wooooooo! I miss this series
Charmader's death was a definite shock factor
I was watching some thing but I saw this and was like OH MY GOD EPISODE 10
Anyone else see mewtwo 12:48
This is heart breaking bro keep up the good work 😁
When this series is complete, the Pokemon company will hide their faces out of shame that this channel managed to make their own franchise more of a masterpiece than they ever could.
Look, while I *1000000% respect your efforts throughout this series,* I will say I am *beyond disappointed with your decision to actually have let Charmander die as well as let go of Bulbasaur.* I was very VERY EXCITED for this episode and what is left of this series, but now, without Charmander/Bulbasaur (both who could've have such character development till the very end, especially Charmander), I can't say I'm that excited for it with just Squirtle/Wartortle alone. What a total shame...... :(
I love pokemon
2:32  I hope the bidoof that got launched where wartortle is going is gonna appear on the top of the mountain
Are you going to make more 🥺
and also i miss the old team
Did anybody else see misingno and mew two?
"Could tell, because there are X's where its eyes should be."   XD
Yay finally
This is giving me violet evergarden vibes lol
Who else noticed mewtwo in one of the flash backs
We need Jump knight 2
Turtwig said what I was thinking at 11:14
Wait, I thought this was meant to take place in a game boy where things like missingno exist, how is sinnoh in this
Dude this episode was amazing but, it took you a year to make this? I don’t think I’ll be able to wait
Alright guys see you in 2023!!!
I remember watching this in middle school
Personally I don’t like squirturle because he abandoned charmander because he was killing other Pokémon, but then he contradicts himself by following caterpie and probably killing more, I have a feeling that you took this into account and have a reason for it because of squirtule and caterpies last interaction. Also I love the attention to detail, 10 years later and sinnoh was 10 years after kanto.
When's ep 11 coming? I'm waiting...well it was sad that charmander ☠, i thought he was gonna live and evolve or something...overall,it was a good ep. thank you!!
I couldn't believe my eyes when I say this pop up!
This was just... amazing i have no words i'm crying rn
I think it took 2 years to get that water
Everytime one of these drops is like Xmas
So.... When episode 11?
Wait no Bulbasaur or Charmander? Dude you kinda didn't give us a good reminder or what happened during the whole 10 years...I'm a little disappointed tbh. I excepted better.
Yay my fave pokemon snover is referenced
did i just see muwtow
I loved the episode!! Charmander was my favorite character, however I respect the writer's and the story line. I would like to see turtwig come back fully evolved and have a rivalry or fight with Wartortle/Blastoise. Also Mewtwo fighting Missingno at 12:50 was an amazing touch. Cant wait for the next one!!!
It’s finally here… I don’t remember when I watched this when I was 6
YEEEEEESSSSS
YES FINALLY ITS HERE EPISODE 10!!!!!1!
It's here!!
I have completely forgot about this series im so glad this episode popped up in my recommended
Me like Noooo did they really kill off charmander and bulbasaur
So did bulbasaur died or not
I Was s sad when i heard charmander died
I watched this series in 2018 and I have loved this series. It's amazing and I was so sad at the end of episode 9. He really mirrored by personality back then and him coming to terms with needing friends right before being killed in cold blood is the saddest thing for me. I'm hoping so bad for Charmander to come back but I'm really happy about Squirtle's character development because it wasn't really explored before this
fuckin charmander died
What about MissingNo.
Finally, it here
Re-watched 1-9 before I watched this
nice!!
SPOILER ALERT  We literally waited 2 years to find out that Char is actually dead (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻
now who’s ready for the next one in 197 years
FINALLY! IT HAS BEEN 4000 YEARS! (jk it's only been 2 years but im still happy)
Yeeeeesssss
Omg omg it is finally here.
and the thing is i dont know what this flame pokemon has a deal whit beavers place cant he just leave theme alone
Finally, 2 more left
guess we need to wait another 1-3 years for the next episode.
That Snover voice acting is dope
Bruh !!!!!!!!😦😦😦💀💀💀💀💀I thought it was a hat I just realized it was charmander head
Ur so awesome I love this  it was worth the wait
Poor Squirtle loses all of his Fire-type buddies. :(
is this the secound season
Btw squirtle was lvl 98 so he will evolve again
This truly was the best one of them all. You can see why it took so long to make
FINNNALLLLLYYYYY
Squirtle was lying: he's level 98 and still needs to learn moves? He clearly didn't want to evolve, hopefully he did and we got to see the dope badass Wartortle <3
Damn, like to be honest, charmander was the most unique character that was fun to watch. Very disappointed that he’s dead.
Finally it’s back ty
This was fantastic
Worth the wait 😃
This>Wotfi 2021.
Plz, use revive on the charmander!
Where's Charmander?
OMG YESSSSSSS
After 20 years it came out we all have waited for the chance to see this.
Finally
he's finally back when the world needed him most
damn finally, it's been a few years since the last episode :D
Glad the series is back its been a while....
after all this time... its finally here boys... we got what we needed... and what we wanted...
Wow just wow I'm speechless
Im crying
Ugh finally
Im just hoping the next fire generation pokemon will be alive and this story should has good ending pls:") ripcharmander😌
And now im curious about the god, charmander, bulbasaur and the missingo or that glitch pokemon whatever the name is
This is a legendary day. Gumbo I is back and starter squad 10 came out it’s insane
Yes it’s finally out
12:49 thought I wouldn't see this lol
After 1 year legend Has Uploaded Ep 10
Top 3 fastest things in the world. 3. The speed of time 2. The speed of light 1. How quick this episode went
YES FINALY
Nooo! You kill charmander how could you!
I JUST SAW THIS IN MY RECOMMENDED IM FKING READY LETS DO THIS!  EDIT: ok, I got a prediction  I think episode 11 will be about Bulbasaur realizing everyone is gone and travel to Lavender Town to find Charmander’s ghost. Since he doesn’t know where Squirtle is, he knows it’s he’s the only friend he has left. He does find him, but Charmander (Now a Ghastly) doesn’t remember anything. After a series of revisiting locations, he eventually remembers, and transforms into a ghost Charmander, now reformed mentally. The two see a news report in the Pokémon Center saying that cameras have spotted a Wartortle climbing Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh. MissingNo looms behind them, impressed that Wartortle managed to defeat a god. Mewtwo appears to stop it, but it vanishes, presumably to the mountain to posses him. He recognizes the Bulbasaur and Charmander he saw 10 years ago, and reluctantly decides to bring them with him because of their pleas. But first, they must quickly round up an army of Pokémon to stand a chance.  Who knows what will happen in episode 12.
She’s killed charmander she has his head
Finallyyyy
This has been the best one so far
Starter Squad episode 10 came out? *Impossible*
The show was cool at first but now it’s just edgy
There back FINALLY

From you..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ( Edit : charmander, DIED!??!?! Spoiler this is not spoiler but, i didn't finish the video. )
Magical just magical
You should make a video where charmander comes back
This was depressing at first but squirtle found his fire he is no longer doing things of others now it’s for him 😁😁
Best season
12:51 look closer who is mewtwo fighting with?
Wait charmanders dead?
Squirtle having Vietnam like flash backs is pretty funny
Awww look at that neckle he use looks like he's trainer Blue I love it 😍😍😍
waiting 1 year for this one episode was worth it  the episode was wonderful!!!!
Great episode, see you in a year for the next 👍🏻😁
This episode was awesome after all this time but I am still sad about charmander
finally you released this
IT WAS SO EPIC!!!
finally
I'm sorry this episode was REALLY BAD!  I hate the transition from Ep9 to Ep10. Should've stuck to first gen pokemon and never kill off Charmander and not let Squirtle evolve.
LETS GOOO FINALLYYYY
I feel like squirtle is the new charmander because when he attacked out of turn..
YES
Yes episode 10
Wait so... Oh my god they're dead

IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS, HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
Jyst imagine that charmender is the god that will be confusing
8 years for 10 episodes lol
I tho there will be a epic fight for the original
Wartortle: Arceus! I’ll have my revenge!     And thus the Pokemon gods disappeared from Mt.Moon
OMG
The long wait is finally over. Wow, I can't believe how the story improved significantly over the past few years! This is a masterpiece on its own! Thank you for bringing us this series. Squirtle's character development was definitely great. I hope Bulbasaur will return soon.
Yes they finally Wake up
1 year = 1 episode

Dont think we didnt noticed mewtwo and missingno in the background. Until they settle things, i dont see bulbasaur being gone either.

its been too long make sure the next ep comes soon im sad that charmander is dead and that char is too keep up the great work
LOVE IT 😍
thanks for the video
Plss more
YESSSS ITS FINALLY OUT MY CHILDHOOD YES YES YES
The nostalgia is epic
HE UPLOADED OMGGG
No charmander!
Snow:what the fu...
Parent- so what did you do in school today Me- something
Finally the wait is over
Very cool very very
I think dialga and palkia solve this whole mess. I doubt if blastoise would even be able to defeat dialga and palkia lol, but i think he will convince them.
I can't believe you really off-screen'd Charmander.  I mean, I *don't* believe you really off-screen'd Charmander.  As in, this whole thing is heading towards Bluey going back in time and saving him or some such ridiculous shit.  Otherwise, this is a shark jump and ¾.
Omg finally it came out I've been waiting so long can't wait for more episodes also insane quality.
The legend of the squad continues… for now
Squirtle became Kratos lol. Anyways, amazing lore, animation and voice acting as always! The wait for worth it. :)
this is top tier fan made content
Finally! We can watch ep.11 in 2043 🙂
I wonder how the video qualit would be like for ep 11 but still sad charmander die but he shall come god
You guys are just awesome
I can imagine a butterfree at the top of mt coronet
Is she wearing char head
man the nostalgia
I want the squid to get back to geter like the old times  when thay have avengers together
RIP Charmander plz bring back Bulbasaur
this gives me god of war vibes tbh
That whole bit with Squirtle and the giant snow tree reminded me of God Of War, to the dialogue and the fight scenes. The animation is amazing! Excited for the next episode
FINALLY!
am so happy that im gonna cry. this pokemon starter thing is so fantastic
AYY, FINALLY
Just 2 more episode and I am curious
Just amazing. Thank you for that episode, everyone 🥰
Is bad and is good at the same time im stil cunfuis about the begining
I miss the starter squad and your YouTube channel too
Can you make Charmander resurrected please for the next one
Please don’t stop
Holy shit I just realized the joke know.  Blue shell man guy= Blue shirt guy aka ryan renolds character from free guy.
Wow that was great! How long have I been waiting for this! And ... see you again in two years? XD Just just, thank you so much, for a great job and for making us enjoy it that way. Keep giving us great things!
Prediction: They are gonna reach the top of Mt.Coronet, he's gonna evolve and battle Dialga and Palkia, ask them to take him back into time and save charmander, take on Arceus and Giratina and finally defeat the Gods and Ressurect Chimchar. Maybe Reach Kalos and Mega Evolve?
Well that was definitely worth the wait
this is dark but good
Well this got dark...
THIS WAS BLOODY AMAZING I’m really happy to see my favourite character finally break free from the Caterpie. An amazing episode. I love this series so much. Thank you for this brilliance
That was good
I TOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD
NAHHH U CAN'T JUST LEAVE US ON A CLIFF HANGER LIKE THAT
How long will EP.11 come…
Okay so. Ima be honest. This series is a GREAT watch. The characters feel like genuine characters. And i absolutely love it.   Tho there is some criticism i can give. First off, in episode 9, the geodude that absolutely fucks up Charmander. After that happens. There is legit no more mentions of his attacks actually effecting Charmander. It kind of felt like that battle never even happened at all.      But other then that, the show is great! A solid 9,7/10
wow,I finally see this! its been 2 year!
It felt so dark for me
alright guys, time to wait another 2 years for another episode..
It just isn't the same after charmander and bulbasaur are gone
Good Lord this was well worth the wait
HOW IS IT FINNALY BACK
No way NA AH  FINALLY!!
When is part 11
did not expect
It’s freaking 2021 and now you just did is this episode we will waiting one year dude what the hell
I’ve waited 4- no, 5,000 years for this
Man I just rewatched the whole series 2 days ago never expected for him to post an episode today
22:45 Squirtle, remember this, it's never too late, or I guess wartort- oh wait no spoilers
NICE NOW I HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR AGAIN YAY
Finally!
I love how Mewtwo is still fighting MissingNo lmao
HES BACK
Took him 1 or so years to make this love it , great job I like the animations
Wow, that turned out to be a pretty intresting episode. It was teribly sad though.
So long to long break bro
See y’all in another two years
I really hope one of these “gods” is Dialga who’s able to send Wartortle back in time to save Charmander
U guys are absolute beasts for making such an amazing series! I really love it and wish we could see more of what you guys can do, cuz based on this series u can make something even more awesome with a bigger budget. Well regardless thanks a ton, love following this journey of urs!
I've been waiting for a year and it was worth it
Is this the start of the Shippidge cinematic universe?
Yes something
The Man, The Myth, The Legend- Shippiddge has posted!!!
See yall in 2023
Wait how did charmander die?
I didn't think that charmander will actually die😬
Imagine Blastoise
FINALLY AFTER 27 YEARS
You definitely lost future sub
I clicked.. So fast.
Poor hm slaves 😥
YEEES FINNALY
Ep10
Yes
15:52 G-MAX ABOMASNOW
GUYS!!! did y'all see that at 14:36 when squirtle is talking about replacing Turtwig, the snover gets replaced too!!
This is incredible! totally worth the wait!
DO MORE EPISODES DO IT COME  ON DO IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR  YOU DUMM SLOW BISKIT
wow i cant believe charmander really died im fr depressed
Two more episodes to go
now just wait 2 or more years for ep 11
Teh wait is worth it
I would love to see the return of charmander God's revive him and the family is back
Finally took you slowpokes long enough
mor
I ligit have waiting for years
12:50 Mewtwo Vs Missingno, Huh
Watch, all the legendarys are going to be up there, this is my prediction.
Wow. Brilliant. Amazing. One of the gems of YouTube and am so glad you made another episode.  Spoiler alert———— Was pleasantly surprised by the turn this series took, going for a darker tone. I have to commend shipping for taking the leap to actually k1ll off the main character and tell a very good story about mortality, regret and friendship.
This is amazing. The writing, the storytelling, the animation, the cinematography, the acting, the music... Amazing. The wait was extremely worth it. Can't wait for the next chapter 😊
Finally
Is it going to take a year for the next video
THE KING IS BACK
wait you still make these?
My wait is not useless :D
NOOO!!!!!! CHARMANDER
I hope they make more then 12
Finally
Dis is like pokemon mystery dungeon games
OH GOD this is the best episode so far
R.i.p charmander
Time to wait 10 more years until the next release :D
I can't wait for ep 11 !!!
The return of a legend
YES FINALLY :D
Bruh i know the gods gonna tell him to either bring back charmander or chim char he ll have to choose sad ending incoming
Over a year finely
We Have Been Waiting For A While  Edit: The Quality Improvement between 9 and 10 is crazy
FINALLY
....the fact that the last episode end was real... and charmander is really dead.... makes me incredibly sad and now Im just scared of whats next
Please we need more…
Let’s GOOOOOKL!! I never knew how much I wanted a vid to drop until this video
2 more
Soooooooooo worth the wait! I loved the little clip of mewtwo and missingno duking it out when Squirtle snapped into soldier mode, and I especially loved watching squirtle finally grow up and evolve! I'm super sad to hear about carmander tho 👉👈 he was my favorite
bring back bulbasour and charmander
YES FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here I am finished this episode and cant wait for the next one aggain :). Thanks for making this awesome series
I do miss the silliness of Bulbasaur.  But man this is epic stuff. Well done!
Finally after 2 year this slowbro is making this episode
Its been so long but damn it so good
Even doe pokemon is kinda cringe now this hits home
YOU FOCKING DID IT! FINALLY!
No one's going to talk about how this is the most depressing part of the series
I bet you Squirtle well Wartortle is going to ask the gods to make everything back to the way they used to be
FINALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
This series might have become one of the best anime 😆 but ooff damn that's dark n kinda sad cause Squirtle didnt get to learn that Char has changed 😢 Cant wait to see what will happen next 😍
So, what happen after the events on eps.9 are charmander actully died, squirtle become the slave of the catterpie and try to create new team but failed and bulbasaur leaving them? Damnnn it hurtss
Honestly cant wait for the next one! Great job!
how the hell after ten years squirtle has not even evolved?
ITS NOT OVER!!
Finally it came up
Where’s bulbasaur!! Don’t tell me he died?!?!!? :(
It's finally here
where is Bulbasaur and Charmander
At 12:51 mewtwo is fighting missingno
13:30 Did squirtle use poison sting to kill Leonard? Well. Hitmonchan incident really messed up things in Kanto...
Finally yes!
Well that was certainly a left turn
I thought this ended a lot of time ago, and I was really sad as I loved this series. So glad that you were actually making the next episode all along. Keep up the good work and… rip charmander :(
12:51  Why is mewtwo there????
no Charmanderrrr, Charmander only wants to save squirtle
Oh my freaking god finally,I have waited over a year
Damn it's finally out
YES YES YES YES YES YES
R.I.P charmander and bulbasaur
Omg new video
This is the best show on YouTube.
ITS BEEN SO LONG
Man... i swear.. all of the fake episode 10's i watched...... but its true..... ITS REAL!! I realy love this series.... so much.... thank you for making this...... also not thank you for the  couple year long wait for a new episode🤣😂🤣 (jk jk)

Finally

Finally a new ep by the way what took you so long it's been like 2 billion years since is never been uploaded
I just hope that the next episode doesn’t take another two years
😂
THANK YOU, MR. SCIENCE!!! "YOU'RE WELCOME!"
Hey, it’s blue shirt guy! Oh, it’s blue shell guy
I really Happy det you dinint stop your YouTube  correct
This gave me MASSIVE God of war vibes
Snover is my new favorite pokemon haha
It took over a year
First of all,did charmander and bulbasour switch to another body???i didnt watch the  whole episode but from the start i knew the monkey was acting like char..
Finally
Someone made Abomasnow look cool. A milestone in Pokémon history.
wait what happen to bulbasaur didn't die did he. i don't remember
The quality of this is way better than the last episode, and I'm happy the wait is finally over since this is an amazing series
I think wartortle is gonna ask where charmander is an he comes back to the series🥳
But I hate the fact the balbasor died!!!!!!!!!
squrtle is level 98 he should be blastoise by now
I'm sorry...what? Mad respect for what you've done Shippiddge, and I get this is your series to write as you like, but...I can't help but feel a little let down that it took over 2 years to find out Charmander really is dead and that Bulbasaur was just written out. This episode honestly feels like you just threw out all the previous events and started over. I'm seriously hoping whatever caused this decision is somehow tied into the next two episodes.
i was turtwig, laughing at "bird" until realizing charmander died (is blubasaur dead?)
OH YES!!! AFTER ALL THIS TIME ITS HERE
This entire story legit FEELS like a story pokemon would make (if they were less of a kid friendly company)
This was too good, and to think I just stumbled upon it
ITS HAPPENING
I Wonder Why It Took So Many Years For Them To make This Because Of The Crazy Animation at The End. The Snover's Accent Was Hilarious
Yes Squirtle evoled into Herobrinewartotile
LETS GO HE REVIVED THE SERIES ONCE AGAIN AFTER 2 YEARS
FINALLY you made the episode    I LITERALLY GRADUATED EXPLORED THE WORLD BEAT KSI IN A BOXING MATCH AND CLIMBED MOUNT EVEREST...
Your back
Shit went from 0-100 real fast.
I want see charmelon on charizard
Plz put charmendar
Where’s charmander
time to wait a year for ep 11
Charmander was my favorite character…
Wait what is in the last episode who turns into his last arousing he’s gonna fricking kill everyone
Charmander actually died :( i didn't expect that
2 years and it was worth it
R I P CHARMANTER
squirtle is like an overpowerd mc who's just awaken his edgy side
finally
2 years of wait was definitely worth it
Charmander died 😭😭😭 I wanted him to live 😭
When is the next episode comin ?
i love this but sadly gonna have to wait couple years or so for more :(
Fricking Squirtle is almost stronger then shaggy
Pretty sure this is s2
Just one more evolution to go then maybe mega evolution
Charmender died or what? 😰😰
YAY
Me so happy for release of episode 10 me realises that I might have to wait another year for episode 11
This is enough to make a grown man cry
Yessss Episode 10 is finally out!
YES FINALLY THE 10TH EPISODE  IS HERE 😭😭😭😭
After a year we have it finally    ( playng brick bronze while whatching this)
Pokemon but it's Berserk and Squirtle is Guts
I’m sad because charmander was my favourite character
Wow I thought episode 9 was only out one year ago? I guess my brain really just erased 2020 lmao. I'm so happy this is out! I've loved every episode. They're always so good and worth the wait. Thank you for keeping up with the series even during times I dont want to keep up with my own life crap. Yadda yadda. Thanks fam
We will miss you char......  mander
I knew the wait would be worth it. It’s finally time to watch… *episode 10* Edit: Spoilers       I have no clue how to begin with how amazing this episode was. Wartortle’s character development took such a great turn, and it was a surprise to see Caterpie realise what they did was wrong. Still can’t believe Charmander died. I can only hope Wartortle can somehow use Dialga to reverse time and stop the death, even if it is just weak hoping
Where is bulbasaur? he still alive last episode right?
You did that no one thought of
These episodes are better than actual pokemon series
Being slightly bigger changes nothing
This was worth waiting for!
Yessssss
Finally a new vid
Wow W o w Wow
This must have been a lot of work, thank you so much for making it, I've been waiting a long time. This makes Squirtle look epic.
Oh my now that he’s evolved he sounds so different
Wait a new episode?!?!?
Charmender😭
YOOOOO
Two more years for more ples make it sooner
Makes since that Squirtle would live and win. Plus hes got that start deathbattle going for em. Excited for the potential blastoise arch, but nice to see some wartortle screentime.
turtwig sounds liek sonic
Yep now I'm hooked
I waited for 2 years just for this? :/
That chimchar character was so fucking annoying
Where tf is charmander and bulbasaur
Anyone notice how Mewtwo is still battling missingno.
I think he might go back in time to save Charmander and in the end Squirtle or Wartortle will max out at level 100 evolving into Blastoise
Is this real?
Epic
Finally i been waiting for this.
Rip the chars
Please upload the next episode soon
Finally
Fun fact a rock has fallen to the dead body of the charmander and the stone was a revive stone so he got revived and now is really REALLY mad at squirtle
what happen to chamender now i remember he got kill....ed
I don’t know how long I’ve been waiting but you’ve made my day with this
It’s actually come out!!!
🤦‍♀️
ooh update on the animation wait does the humans still say human over and over again
This series is my childhood
It's been a long wait...
It was worth the wait. And its Legendary!!!
* gasp * i thought you just abandoned the series
finally the 10th ep
Finally I’ve been waiting for a year
It finally came...
AWESOME✨
It’s all like real life. We are all humans, we don’t deserve to be bossed around and follow orders. Everyone has their own life and people should have freedom
What if charmander and bulbasaur got revived and becomes charizard and venusaur with mega stones because of the plot?
Jesus bloody Christ
The Story of this episode it reminds me of God of War and i‘m a huge fan of GOW😍😍😍
I hope warturtle gets a new friend for helping and good job on all of this!
This is a series that changed the course of this economy
After what? Two years?
Caterpie is wearing Charmander's head...
Huge plot twist. Love it
wait what happen to bulbasaur and charmander?
After 2 years finaly
*monke*
I watched U one year ago and forgot I subbed u and forgot U existed sorry

omg charmander actually died nooo :'(
Oh my god oh my god finally

FINALLY
Can’t wait for the next episode in another two years
Thanks on making another one when I was seven I was addicted to this series
Finally
it seems mewtwo has been fighting missingno for that whole 10 years by himself
Well. The wait is finally worth it
The episode was worth the wait!
I thought Charmander would survive
OMG ITS FINALLY HERE IM SO HAPPY
And then I thought the series was cancelled, LET'S GO!! THIS EPISODE WAS FIRE!!!

Char for Charmander
FINALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I feel sad that charmander died
I like how they just replace Bulbasaur with that thing and then Charmander which I still don’t know is dead because I haven’t watch the full video or if it just doesn’t show it and Charmander with that thing
Both funny, emotional and pretty fun development in squirtle turning into wartutitole after accepting what he did during war
And at last more years are going to pass by to get episode 11
Been following this series since the beginning. I'm almost 19 now Seeing your improvement over the years. Damn, I'm proud of ya man   Can't wait for the next episode in a few years x3
I waited a whole year just to realise charmander died?!🥲
AYO???
Prediction war turtle fights wins and both chimchar and charmander come back to like next episode is about charmander wartortle and balbasaur
Yall dont know who fun it is to find this story just days ago then this new episode suddenly appeared in my recommendations lol.
squirtle has gone super sayan
Wartortle > any universe
Episode 11 here i come.
Feels weird that Charmander's 8 year long character arc kinda got brushed aside in a "10 years later" soft reboot where the development is all  of a sudden given to Squirtle honestly.  I don't mind the lack of a happy ending but it kinda feels like script whiplash suddenly being in Sinnoh and only seeing the last ten years of Squirtle's life in a couple quick flashbacks. Comes off like some massive pills to swallow were more or less brushed off given the pacing. I'm still invested, and for all I know maybe Charmander's story ISN'T over, but if it is I'd have preferred something less abrupt, something to milk out the emotions for the rash protagonist we've followed for so long.   Squirtle himself is handled well (though him going saiyan as a Wartortle is rather silly, however it could be explained as him holding off his evolution for way too long) and it is interesting to see him completely broken and robotic, definitely not an "I told you so" he wanted to be right about. Seeing the foil character take the spotlight so suddenly is weird but it's handled well at least
Yes boi
Mmmm
BLUE SHELL MAN GUY
holy crap how long of a time gap is this i mean, squirtles level 98
Squirrel turn into Kratos
Sick thing man
ONG I WAITED FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW
finally its been 2 years

So many old series are ending, Charlie the unicorns over, this is nearing its end, what other forgotten but beloved series will end?
Yoo finaly
Well time to wait another year
When this series came out 8 years ago I was 6 years old I was watching since episode 1 because I liked pokemon now i'm 14 and now when it's over I'll be done with school
Its been 3000 years
WE NEED CHARMANDER
Oh my oh my godnes
NO WAYS IT S HERE IM 14 NOW BUT ITS HERE!

WHY DID CHARMANDER DIE!?😭
Charmander :(
I missed this
LETS FUCKING GO

Great now again we have to wait another 1 year great

Been waiting for this for so long

It was totally worth it waiting for so long for EPISODE 10, SUPER AWESOME WORK Shippiddge
YES YES FINALLY
Just had to get stitches  today so wasnt expecting this
I didn’t notice this at first but when he finally evolved, the music immediately skipped to the ending. Like the music paused when he first denied his evolution and resumed when he finally excepted his evolution!
*ITS BEEN 2 YEARS*
More pls!!!!!
FINALLY
It’s been 84 years…
F I N A L L Y
why did u kill charmander im sorry but im done with the series
Episode 10 was truly amazing i remember watching this  i think right after episode 3 was released and then I got hooked great work and I can't wait for episode 11
The Return of The Kings
They could go to lavender Town tower and find charmanders ghost
finally it been a year
ITS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Been waiting for this. No skipping of ads is the only thing I can do.
Ight cya in 2 years yall
This is a masterpiece👑
Cue the beginning if the new-found Starter Squad anime.  If there ever is an episode 11, then I will literally lose my mind and drop everything just to watch it, and I hope it's soon!  I'd be willing to watch from the very beginning to the very end at any time, multiple times.  And once all the episodes are released, I'm going to do just that!
The time has come
Haha
No way after waiting for so long it arrived
Dude i tough your dead
Because of this I'm gonna replay pokemon red and pick charmander and burn the fuck out of viridian forest to find that caterpie
I love how Squirtle changed after Charmander died. I kinda expected him to evolve, but it's ok, I prefer him staying as a Squirtle Edit: That last part was wrote when I didn't get to the part where Squirtle evolved into Wartortle yet. Also, did Squirtle's skin color changed?
I wish they kept Charmander alive I liked him he didn't care about rules
I love it
When does ep11 come
oh wow, this was cool, I did not expect this to turn into such an epos like story I liked Abomasnow, nice work
YAY I'M HAPPY
WHAT ?! A tear came to my eye just now..
this episode was EPIC
We waited 2 years for this
YOUUCASYBCMub,JHBBJN FINALLY GODDAMIT
*sees part 10 is out*  Suddenlyyyyyy life has a new meaning, to meeeeeeeeeee
Bruh finally you posted a video btw love your videos 😊😊😊
Wait a minute. It's been so long. I have to go over the first nine episodes again
2 more episodes
That was.... Dissapointing. Killing off the main character just as he reaches the climax of his arc, and then continuing on with a new focus is a bold move; and I really don't think it worked out here. Changing the tone of the entire series so drastically is another large risk, and the change wasn't fluid enough to make it work. Maybe my opinion will change when the rest of the series is out, but right now I'm not exactly on the edge of my seat.  I don't care about Char or Turtwig. The long standing base motivation of the story switched without much (if any) closure. It's as if the previous 9 episodes meant nothing. Like we're starting on a whole new series, or rather a sequal, without ever finishing the first.  The flashbacks Squirtle has are the most interesting. It's heart-wrenching to watch our new protagonist's descent into servitude; his soulless trudge through a war he allowed to happen due to his own lack of action, and failure to protect his friend, and his apathethy towards his sudden freedom. I hope to see more of that in the next episodes,  Squirtle's story arc in this single episode is vast, and the story itself was fantastic. Having him holding an everstone to avoid evolving without charmander (I'm assuming that's the motivation behind it,) and then removing it to fight for the freedom his friend had always longed for, was a beautiful use of symbolisym. Knowing he was trying to replace his old buddies by recruiting children is a good touch as well, but there's one massive problem. It all happens too fast. We had so little chance to get involved with the brand new plotline, that the climactic removal of the stone didn't leave as big of an impression as it could have. We (the watchers) weren't given enough time to feel squirtle's building rage and sadness, so when he released it in what was an epic battle and monolog, we couldn't feel it as strongly as we could have if we'd been given the proper buid up.  Time to wait another 3 years to see where this train rides.
ITS HERE HYPE, also keep up the good work!
Yaaaaaaaaaa!
finnally
This has completely become something else..
Finally
Not a fan on charmander being dead but good job on the animation it’s very clear to see the time and effort you out it.

that was grate now time to wait another year for ep 11
Finnaly after a very long time ❤️
Hope this series continues

When the world needed him most.... He came back
i cant wait for the next episode
1 yer werfit :)

THEY KILLED OFF CHARMANDER?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! GOD DAMNIT! I was so hoping and looking forward to seeing some actual character development/a possible evolution from him.
Yes its back
Yess thanks waited over a year for this.
This animation has so much movie potential. Congrats on Ep. 10! Keep up the great work!!
I love the snover's in this episode.
Yes yes yes it’s back
GREAT! now, epsd 11!
I am sad charmander died
Welp time to wait till october of 2023 for the next episode. We will get to the final in 2025 or 2027
Finally an upload ❤
omg, the empathy that is just shown is so real its disturbing . also ngl, that really does fit Warturtle.  8:04 also this is just like so meda rn like just omg-
You finely did it
Can't believe it's trending, can't wait for it all
I’m a little confused about a few things did Charmander die for
exactly my b-day yesterday YAY i have been waiting for this
YES
Day 1 of waiting for the next episode. Oct 24,2021.  Post the date when you see this along with a day x of waiting.
It's been 3000 years
Just amazing
I just realised Squirtle calls Chimchar Char because it sounds like Charmander, and everytime he talks to him he's actually talking to charmander. I hope that with god stuff Charmander comes back, cause with Charmander ending his character arc trying to save his friends, I think squirtle (hopefully he's a blastoise soon) will do the same.
Alr out daaaamn
Yay
I've been waiting so long for this, and I've got to say; I miss these episodes
I need to wait one more year ok bet
FINALLY
After a year episode 10 has been brought to life
Well did I predict the future like two weeks ago I was like well it’s Hass to be about time when episode 10 comes out
Man I almost gave up
My prediction will be that he will find dialga and ask to go back in time so he can save charmander and train with him
Finally been waiting for so long bet it’s amazing
This is so beautiful and meaningful. Thank you for blessing us.
This got metal quickly
yeaaaaaaa baby
Theory 3 years to make the next one
I miss the old crew, especially bulbasaur, I really want them back :(
2 years is crazy, shippdidge bout to cook
Awesome,Amazing,Out Standing, Impressive and beyond
This video was awesome
This was sooo food
I saw these all vedios in 2017
YES LETS GO
My childhood dream is fulfilled
Finally
😭
Y donde estaba balvasor pero si me gusto que escuedro evolucionara a squilter
Chimchar = technoblade "Anachy"
I have been waiting for years
Why is every fire type a jerk and dead
This is my favourite episode,  1:squirtle my favourite pokemon 2:this video is literally dedicated to squirtle 3:the story is very sad and good and unexpected, I didn't think charmander would actually die
To anybody who thinks squirtle/wartortle shouldn't have won that fight, consider this, he's level ninety fucking eight. Honestly, i'm surprised they didn't beat what i assume is a mega abomasnow as a regular squirtle with their everstone.
Im ngl the themes in this are extremely impressive...way better than like 99% of recent media thats come out. Not to mention all of the symbolism and attention to detail (like changing the dot on the caterpie's headband to black while spearow had red) like bruh excellent work. I don't even mind the wait because the quality that comes out is always top notch. The snover flashback was my fav part...I was ready to see the flashback of him having a flashback hahaha
We waited for years bro
bruh charmander died .... wtf
The return of the King.
I feel like there is some BIG foreshadowing in this episode
Finnaly yeyeyeeyeyy episode 10 yeyeey
2 years...
Ep 11 please keep making more I love your animations there so awsome dude
Wait when will ep 11??
Bro I wanna see episode 11
Awesome episode yo.
OMG YAY 10TH EPISODE
finally, the waiting is over.
I hope mewtwo is still relevant to the story
Now squirtle now like a meteor
YES ITS FINALLY HERE
finally after 2 years of waiting, i can stop waiting, for starter squad 10 has come out         but theres 2 more
Where’s charmander and bulbasar
This has been a shocker charnander is dead and bulbasaur maybe too.
YAYYY ANOTHER EPISODES I HAVETB WATCHED IT BUT THIS WILL BE GOOD
Congrats on EP10 MAZING
THE LEGEND IS BACK!!!!
Love this series man :)
R I M Charmander.😔🙏
Gonna miss you Charmander ❤
FINALLY
Omg finally
Thanks
Don’t worry, it just took 2 years.
Good job
WOOOOOOOOO, but now we must wait again, for well...till 11 comes out, then after that, its the finale.
This was super funny and awesome it was worth the wait
12:50 that’s what I’m most interested about kinda
i cant wait for the  next episode. ITS SO AMAZING
I kinda think it was a bad idea killing charmander as he’s the main antagonist, and he was the most funny too, I don’t know how, but maybe he’ll come back? I hope so, he’s my fav
2 more episodes and its end of this but pls make 2nd season
ITS FINALLY HERE
Pls make a New Charmander
That was AMAZING
Yooooooo its out!!!!
FINALLY
And even after ten years, Mewtwo is still fighting "the Anomaly"

OH MY ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
Finnely
YESSIR
Where are the revives
wait, what about Mewtwo?
so wheres piplup
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The stoned bidoof
I'm sad about charmander dude. I really wished he survived. Cause I'm just like him in reality. He didnt deserve to die. The real irritating one is the caterpie. Really dumb!!!!
the best series of pokemon ive ever seen
Congratulations on the successful release! So thankful to finally see this!
After 2 years finally
Why did u show charmander  dead he was my favourite  I am unliking and unsubscribing
I've been waiting for so long
noooooo, pls let charmander come back
YES EP 10 IS HERE
If no charmender no more intrest on your videos kill squirrel or die
How has it been 2 years since the last episode? And the fact that now there’s only 2 left is exciting and mind boggling. My friend showed me this show when I was still in high school and I’m now in my 5th year of college and he’s about to have a kid. Time really does fly by. Look forward to coming back for what’s next.
day 109201: They finally came back
OML, ISNT THE GUY VOICING SNOVER THE SAME GUY VOICING "BOOK" IN DOMICS' ANIMATION "college bookstore vs the internet"?
Very good episode! Kinda amazed no one is talking about minute 12:51, though. At least I haven't found any comments on that yet. Pretty amazing!
THEY KILLED CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO finally thank you now just like 8 more years
Did my man charmander really have to die
wait charmander ACTUALLY fucking died?!
Finally I’ve been waiting for episode 10 for years
Early (21 hours after its created)
f f f f f f FINALLY AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF STALKING YOUR ACCOUNT IT IT IT IT'S HERE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lvl 99 wartotle lol
This was freaking amazing!!!!
We have waited for this video for an eternity, and thus it finally dropped
This finally game out over a year! Thank you!
Loved it
FINALLY.  Where the fuck where you?
Finally dude I was watching this when I was like six I'm now 13 and it's finally 10 ep
are you shure squirtle is't kratos
noooo charmender is dead whyyyyyy why cannot it evolved and killed that cartepie
Charmander was my favorite character, but I'm glad you had him die. Too many shows and movies have some deus ex machina to save their main character, so I like that you actually had him die. So there's actual consequences for each character's actions.
Yes finnaly episode 10
BROOOO I LITERALLY **JUST** WANTED TO CHECK UP ON THE CHANNEL!
i want bulbasur to come back i want the old squad to come back :(
only 2 more year for this be done
Ive been waiting for this for years, and I can't wait for more to come. Well now there is more wait to come.
See you guys in 4 years
𝚃𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚔 𝚜𝚑𝚒𝚝
Its bin 2 years  2
Did you guys see mewtwo in the second flash back
I was expecting chimpchar to be a reincarnated charmander
is this real? i loved this series when i loved pokemon and was sad when i found out it ended. now i dont actually like pokeomn but i will still watch it because it is nostalgic
The lizard.
Please do ep 11

YEAAAS FINALLY

23:03 so you have chosen death
FINALLY!
I’ve been wait for this day to come
Finnaly

I actually remember thinking that squirtle avenging charmander.
FINNALY AFTER 2 YEARS EPS 10 IS FINNALY RELEASED
incredible
Finally
Yes
Finally!
FINNALY
Yessssssssss Finally   Charmander is ACTUALLY DEAD OMG why are so many people dying this got dark quickly
I love how freaking tired & empty Squirtle looks at some points in the flashbacks. Really shows how cruel the Caterpie are without outright stating it. Great storytelling!
Please more I’ve been waiting for years
FINALLY
the trio is back       edit: WTH
MY GOD!!! THIS WAS AWESOME, THE LORE, THE MUSIC, THE NODS, THE VA'S AND THE ANIMATION! THE BEST POKEMON CONTENT IVE EVER WITNESSED. ACTUAL NINTENDO SHOULD HIRE U , ID PAY FOR THIS KIND OF QUALITY!!!!!!
Finally they upload another episode
Did wartortle evolving again to blastoise ???
12:51 brah
YYEEESS they are back
Hi
OK I need to make a confession, I hated charmander. I thought he was a self-centered jerk that had one goal in mind .But after seeing his head and then remembered that he went back after squirtulte .I can't help but feel awful 😞.
Is bulbasaur cause in the flashback everything is gone
Finally
this was FUCKING AMAZING HOLY SHIT  I fucking love the time skip. talk about a whole new layer of lore.
FINALLYYY
Thank youuuuuuuu
squirtle’s character development was top tier. the moment he wanted to replace his lost friends to accepting his evolution was really nice. still sad about charmander’s death
I was keeping hope that charmander would return by the end of the episode since the teaser said "I just wanted to help you." I thought he would be talking to charmander. Until 18:11 and 18:27 where everything in the teaser was said. Nut now I have a new theory on how charmander might return.    Theory 1:  squirtle will ask the pokemon gods to revive chadmander and or tell him where bulbasaur is.     Theory 2: he will ask mewtwo and or the gods to help him revive chadmander or rewind time somehow
FINNALY
Awesome!!!
Idk I'm salty and thinkin bout stop watchin. Rip Charmander
fINALLY
There is only 2 episodes left damn
FINALY ITS OUT
HOORAY! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.
Not sure if it’s just a coincidence, but  Pokémon Red and Blue’s Initial release date is September 28, 1998, and 10 years later, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl would release in North America, Australia, and Europe in 2007, so 10 years passing could be a little reference to the passage of time in between gen’s 1 and 4.
I’m sad that charmander died
FINAL EPISODE!!
After 1 year the legend is back
Why did the main character just died
Please I want charmander revived by dalgiya
holy shit the animation is so much better
Damn that Caterpie's got a nice hat
Now I want to see blue shell man vs Mewtwo because they are both same strength now
After so long its finally here.
Holy shit the nostalgia is real
0:18 now that's what you call accuracy btw who say Mewto fighting hitmonchan?
I can't wait to see Squirtle become Blastoise!
Yayayayyayayayyaya so happy
AFTER 1 YEAR IT IS HEREEEEE
Rip beaver society
am i the only one that feels like the whole charmander plot wasn’t fully fulfilled. Like i feel like there was still a lot more character building and adventure left with his character. It just doesn’t feel right that he was killed off in this way. Props to you for killing the main character, that takes a lot of balls and all but it just feels like there was still more to be said about his character with the whole cerulean cave plot.          i mean there are 2 episodes left so who knows, maybe he didn’t actually die somehow but it just feels a whole lot more empty with charmander and bulbasaur gone and with the whole “10 years later” thing. I still love the series and look forward to finishing it but damn, just feels a bit odd now.
I love how he use new animation and make the flash backs the original animation it’s awesome
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The day has come keep it up!!!!!
finaly i have been waiting my whole life just for this
What anime did I just watch?
finnaly it is here
Wartortle was giving me fucking Kratos vibes
Where is charmander and bulbasaur
Its like the 9th episode came out so long ago and then i blinked, Covid happened, war happened and then this happened
See you guys again in two years
Bidoof
Yes 👏
Amazing!!! Loved it !!! 😊
And when I thought they will never come back, they actually did.......
It's been over 8 years! This is still going?! I completely forgot about this!
Fantastic episode. Glad to see episode 10 finally out.
Where’s buba and charmander
This has awoken memories
I want to see how strong he is as a blastoise :0
Welcome back
Finally
Squirtle just evolved into Kratos
aw man I miss charmander :'(
upload faster
OMG FINALLY!! A NEW EP
After 2 years we can see a new episode
FINALLY
Wdym starter squad? it should be starter solo
can't wait for next episode
Where have you been
Wow this was sad, it’s weird how I watched this so long ago but I’m still waiting for more, Also how you gonna make up two new characters and then just kill one, like it’s probably gonna have an impact on the story or turtwig coming back to save something but dang, I’m still mad charmander died bc of sanshrew mostly like could’ve helped him.
This was fun / Wartortle are AWESOME!!
I’m sad about charmander and bulbasuar
Finally!
TURTWIG!!!!!
This is one of the best fanfictions that I have seen, and I have enjoyed quite a lot of Pokemon fanfiction. The way the themes of leadership and personal responsibility are blended together amazingly. Plus the animation is just fantastic. I just rewatched the entire series, and right from the beginning the models are fantastic!
LESS go
I bet everyone was here waiting for ep 10, this took forever (thank you shippiddge)
I’ve been waiting for literally like 7 years for this and I can’t wait till part 2, if there is gonna be one
………Waw…. That not worth of waiting😑…but still Great Work👍
Whoa so coooooooool
Rest in peace charmander always been my favorite pokemon when i was an childhood and this series (R.I.P Charmander 2013 - 2019)
Finally a new episode
This series is useless without charmander
The legend channel is back
Snover is amazing
Omg that monkey fire thingy is so ANNOYING -/ sorry I forgot his name lol
Yeah yeah, force of will is the maximum power, always the same thing... There are powers stronger than the force of will really. A Wartortle just evolved can't kills an Abomasnow evolved after some time, like a Squirtle can' t win against a Zapdos, also if Squirtle is very angry and Zapdos sleeped. But at least, the creators of Starter Squad were enough mature to do Charmander killed and not saved by a final last instant miracle like ever. But i don' t like the same message that force of will can win against all. It is not real.
FINNALY AFTER AN ENTIRE YEAR IT IS HERE
He can evo more coz he was lv.98 so he can be blastroy? (I forgot how to wrote the name)
1 year in the making and it is better than any pokrmon fanfic or anime that has or ever will exist
I JUST SAW THIS LETS GOOO ITS HERE
LET'S GOOOOOOO
I mean, Pokémon get frozen solid all the time in the games and anime, so chimchar’s probably fine.
yes finally
omgggggg i missed watchcing these😭
What will happen next 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Imagine in like a final fight in the final episode Giratina or Arceus or something have an epic fight with all the gigantimax forms of the Kanto fully evolved starters
Plz make season 2 ASAP!!!!!!
I've waited 4-no,5000 years for this.
All that wait, paid off
Rip charmander
Thank You for Release of Episode 10!
Yay
Yessir
Holy shit, was not expecting this to depressing and good.
is charmander going to be back?
Yesss 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
it was worth the wait:)
quality work, he helped us wait 8 less years ;)
Ep 11: Defeating palkia and dialga cause time and space and evolving into blastoise Ep 12: Defeating fucking arceus with a mega stone idk
this story better than the pokemon anime
It's been soo long! The wait is over. It's finally out! Let's gooo!!!
After a year or something WE GET IT
umm... that was amazing but when you make episode 11 if the gods fight squirtle now wartortle can you make him evolve into blastoice since wartortle evolves at lvl 36 and wartortle is level 98
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
6:43 oh my god! 😳
Oh boy...i can't wait to watch this tomorrow! Gotta sleeo for work in the morning, Bu the Hype is Reeal!!
Snover would definitly be in an 80s sitcom
Let’s go
FINNA y
I remember showing this series to my girlfriend on Christmas eve night as we were in florida visiting her family. And i had just got her into pokemon maybe a month or 2 prior and we were both so upset the 10th episode wasnt out yet now it is and im so happy
I enjoyed it but… the wait was so long, thank u for making this episode and hope to see more
Charizard no
wartortle=doom guy
Please release it next month p
I was so sad when char died
great animation after a year or 2 ( I thought Squirtle was wearing a mystic water  that was dry until I found out is was a everstone)
Where is bulbasaur😃?!?!!
I waited for over years and years for this 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I think charmander will return
After almost a year we got the character we have all been waiting for... a comic relief
Calling it now. Wartortle will get Dialga to send him back in time, prevent Charmander's death, and the new timeline will continue and finish with the hanging plot thread of Mewtwo and Missingno. See you all in three years to see how correct this prediction is! EDIT: Oh, and Wartortle will evolve into Blastoise during a fight with literal gods, maxing out at level 100, easily beating them. byyeee!
Time to wait another year for the next episode
Just AWESOME...
rip charmander bring him back as a delta pls that would be awesome
My man Charmander got smoked :( RIP
I cant believe Charmander died squirtle will revive him for sure
After watching this episode 5 times over, I'll say that the 2-year hiatus was definitely worth it!
Bruh I was like 6 to 8 years old when I started watching this man… It’s been so long
This is awesome but I’m sad charmander died and were is bolbeser
I hope they make it quicker
I wish charmander will be back
This shit made me feel things
What are you gana ask … something
What happened to Bulbasaur
I think I confirmed that Arceus will be in the next episode
I think squirtle climb the mountain and ask dialga to turn the wheel a time back until charmander live and save him from caterpie leader
OMG ITS FINNALLY HERR
The return of the king
i neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed moreeee NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GOD OF MONS coming: I dunno figure it out yourself genius
THE LEGEND IS BACK
finally
I can’t believe charmander is actually dead but I’m not too sad about it though squirtle is my favorite character after all
FINALLY!!
Man, I miss the simple days where the three starters were bickering over who gets picked.   On one hand the massive time skip was a brave and innovative narrative move, on the other hand its basically a different story entirely now (For the second time!)  I'm not sure how I feel about this but the episode by itself was phenomenal.
Finally, it’s been so long
Episode 11 Warturtle brings back Charmander, Bulbasuar and Chimchar by defeating the gods
now I know that why it at time
YES AFTER 2 YEARS!!!
great ep, congrats for the release, I never forget this series when I start watching it when it is in its ep3!
It just don’t feel the same
Holy shit the quality between 9 and this is a ridiculously massive improvement  Honestly, this is S-Tier content. Thank you for all you and your team does!   2 more to go, sad it's gonna end, happy it happened 💜✨
Where is charmandet and Bulbasaur
Very different but great episode! Very much Excited to see what will happen next time!
This was so amazing bro I was so hyped
imagine seeing peanut butter cameoing in starter squad... you know who peanut butter is.
yeah x mean dead spinny eyes mean faint(half-dead)
Yes why did it take so long
God I was not expecting that turn. But now I wanted to know what did happen to Bulbasaur and how did Charmander die?     Edit: I somehow missed episode 9. Oops.
DUDE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Keep up the good work please keep making starter squad videos
Wait if he's lvl 98 then he can hydropump as blastoise right?
... dayum!
OMG ITS AMAZING I UAGE WAITED FOR THIS SINCE THE CLIFF HANGER OF EP 9!!!
Next episode: Wartortle confronts the Spatial and Temporal Pokemon, and possibly the legendary one who created them and all the universe with his ~10000 arms.
Now I just realize, Squirtle kinda sounds like Suction Cup Man.
FINALLY!!!!!!
Wait, if Charmander died, does that mean he actually turned into one of those Gastlys as told by Haunter?
Thank God you come back
btw I like how squirtle comes back
MAKE EP 11 noowwwwwww
"If there really are Pokemon Gods up there, the're gonna have to answer to me!" "Oh cool, what are you going to ask?" *Something*
Is charmander realy death
Finally
Wartortle might ask the gods to revive chimchar, charmander, and probably bulbasaur because in the flashback of him getting released we don't see bulbasaur anywhere
AYYO WHAT?! IT RETRUNED?! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes! This premiered on my birthday!
It's been 2 years since you posted the last video!!!
I’m calling it beaver society is gonna become some sort of meme
its... really the end for Charmander... I'm actually sad now....
i like the flashback part
But the question is when will episode 12 Release😅
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
IT'S BEEN 69 CENTURIES
Finally
YES
Wartortle might find a max revive and revive charmander and chimchar.
finaly 1 y e a r
God of Wartortle
no way....
I love how this series started as a clear "something fun" animation and now it's just an absolute masterpiece😭
I...to..9?!...*breathing heavily while whispering in a frantic manner* and now there's a 10! Now!?
abomasnow is terrifying in this
Finally new episode
I see what happened to Charmander Bulbasaur now
finallyyyyyyyy the wait is overrrrr after all these years
Man I wanted Charmander to come back😔I guess he's gone for ever
12:51 Mewtwo is still trying to get rid of Missing.No
FINALY
I only like basically just started the episode so I have no idea what happens
Yes. Give me more.
Am just saying the God should be Raichu you won’t
Well worth the wait.
Not only did I just remember this right now and searched it up, there is a new episode? this is amazing.
What a minute  Is bulbasaur and charmander is dead?
Amazing bro
What happened to Charmander and Bulbasaur
Finally after a year you finally publish it thank you have been waiting for so long
I can't believe I've been watching these since the beginning.  Amazing episode and will be waiting for the next as always
HELL YEAH
ITS BACK!!!!
This is sad
6:18 Yep definitely a bird
Yes finally after years of waiting
Sooo...this means that we need to wait another 2 years for the next episode??   Ooh...great! :(
IT'S HERE  NOBODY PANIC  *IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED*
2 years wow. worth for the wait
Warturtle have sooo much power wait he is going to fight arceses
Finally i've been waiting for the new episodes, and gosh it's been long time i strumbled across this channel
“I make BIRD sounds!”
Squirtals balls dropped and turned into war turtle
I wonder if Bulbasaur will get any character development considering he was kinda just “there” in the starter squad.
YOOOOOO LETS GOOO IT IS OUT
It’s back, wooooooo! I’m so hyped!
love you bro
O M G .
This is amazing!
I love the Sinnoh personalities. It's way too fitting, especially Turtwig. Plus Abomasnow being the "sacred guardian" of Spear Pillar is just amazing.
This episode blew my mind and how it looks is really cool. 2 years in the making is a long time and we got the best thing in waiting. Patience is a virtue so have some patience in you and you might get results like here. LOVED THE VID!!!!!
Why a whole year tho😭😭
Bro the lore
Man this episode really hits hard
Did charmander die?
OMG!!
Can't wait for Episode 11 in like two years or something!
it's finally! released!
So we just gonna ignore the upgrade in animation quality? This man made this so beautiful, huge props on the 2+ years development to make the best product possible
Squirtle has challenged the Gods up high on the sacred mountain. He didn't evolve into Wartortle, he evolved into Kratos.
no reallly so charmand really died nooooo
YAAAAAAAYY
When I watched this I gotta say I am honestly a bit weirded out that charamander died. At first I though he was the main character of the series since he had a ton of screen time and it was setting the series up for a whole arc for charmander to learn what it is to really be a leader and learn and work with his friend's. Squrtle seemed more like a mentor character and the voice of reason of the group tbh, but then he dies making him feel more like an unimportant set-up character, which made me feel bad for charmander since at the end of ep 9 he finally got to squrtle, it seemed like after he survived the caterpy he would have to continued to grow as a character and become a better person finally realizing his mistakes and change for the better, which I don't mean to criticize. ( Since y'all spent so long and put so much effort into this so alone and the series in general, congrats btw. ) It feels like char's whole arc and struggles were unimportant and had it's story cut short, but that's just how I feel and I don't want to criticize or de-value all y'alls hard work, I'm glad all that hard work payed off, congrats.  Edit: I find it wired that a being that the God's picked themselves was defeated by a warturtle, like how? Your telling me that the being the GODS chose to protect the mountain not only lost to a warturtle but also lost to a Pokemon they have a all the advantages on, not only that but if the they were there killing countless pokemon for who know how long how n the world were they not level 100? A lot of stuff like this in the series does confuse me but this is a series about breaking the rules so I'm not to surprised.
I've waited so long for this moment
It's finally out!
Ok, but the most impressive thing is that an Abomasnow was made actually threatening and powerful.
Charmander murió 😭😭 era mi favorito
how did charmander die
Is there episode 11 I want to see episode 11
Finally it is here!! I am so sad my fav character died😭😭.charmander was best
Rip Charmander
ITS FINALLY HERE
Yaaaaa les go im done watching it.. wait.. NO! NOT ANOTHER 2 YEARS.
The next episode will come in two years
I have waited so long
รอหลังจากนี้อีก2ปี
FINALLLY
I was hoping Charmander was going to evolve
Ok. I'm sad about Charmander. Not cuz he died, but how he died. Hopefully if Warturtle can revive Chimchar, he can revive Charmander and all the Pokemon in the forest too.
Kinda hard to think that this series started when I was 3
Let’s freaking go it’s episode 10
Simplemente Épico, por favor que el otro no demore tanto... mi vida laboral esta por empezar por el amor de Jesús ;-;
NOOOOOOO CHARMANDER IS DEAD AND BAUBERSAUR IS GONE AND SQUIRTEL IS DEPRESSED
Finnily another episode after 2 years
Noooooooooo charmander
Finally
Wait charmander died
You legend, after 2 whole years the series is alive and I can finally watch this is peace.
Apekkkkk!!!!!
Wow, when do we get the next one? 😁
yes
GOD DAMM BRO WHY IN THE FUC* DID KILL OFF CARMANDER MY GOD BRO!!!!! Why AM SO MAD I WANTED TO SEE CARMANDER EVOLVE CHARMELEON
So long
TWO WHOLE YEARS😭 I literally watched this in seventh grade now I’m in 9th
Amazing !!! Worth the wait .
This was hilarious and so well done. Snovers had me dyin dude
So does wartortle find dialga and palkia up there who send him to past to save charmander
wow, we thought it was over
well. that was fun. See you guys in 3 years
I always knew he was the actual main character
Happy 😁
Why did this get so dark 😥
Finally
I have waited 2 *years*      And the waiting was definetely worth it.
Yes finally I love this show
When you realize charmander’s head is on caterpie
So wait- Was the entire looming, multiple episode threat of Missingno solved in a few seconds of fighting in the background? I hope thats not true. That would be really disappointing. Other than that, I loved this episode! The "WHAT THE Ff-" at the end made me laugh.
Finally it here
Yeha boye
Look at how he massacred my boy
HOW DARE YOU BE NOT NICE TO BIDOOF
Those Snovers made me roll 😆
Oh shit. So that's what happened. Now I really can't wait for episode 11, when Squirtle... no, Wartortle, reaches his max Evolution
IT'S BACK
Wow what a great episode! Cant wait for episode 11 in 2024.
Wartortle kill just like god op seen
yyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss bring back memories
I may have aged 60 years since the last episode but I am glad to see it's return
Yay!!! You guys are back!!! But yikes, this was not the direction I thought the plot was gonna go. 😳 😳 😳
This entire series is a S tier movie, and there are still 2 episodes left. The perspectives are what make this so emotional and effective, You know squirtle was worng but yet through his eyes charmander just attacked the caterpies to level up and evolve, through caterpies'  eyes it just wanted revenge on charmander for killing his brother. This makes it so there is no one hero or villain. Just like the real world everyone has a reason, This makes the emotions feel so real, you can see where each of the characters come from. Charmander's character development is insane, and now squirtle can see that, Squirtle now sees that caterpie was not the trainer of his dreams, and that he chose to do the things it told him to do. It wasn't "bluey's" fault it was his. That hit me so hard. Cannot wait for the last two episodes, this 8 years were worth it.
😶 I waited 2 years for this. I couldn't even have begun to imagine what kind of twist these last three episodes were going to bring, certainly not a mentally broken and emotionally desperate Squirtle finally coming to terms with the terrible truths of his past. This got super heavy. And I'm here for it! 🤩 I'd have been happy with them just teaming up with poor Mewtwo to defeat Missingno, but we got so much more. I'm eagerly waiting for the next episode, no matter how long it takes!!
Snows eyes and voice give me the creeps good job
I am waiting for episode 11 & 12
So happy to finally see this episode :3 I like that Caterpie wears Charmander's head as payback for Bulbasaur wearing Pablo's head for so long.
i gonna miss so much a Whiskers :"3
omg
Next ep in 20 years xD
Charmander’s Dead😢
Now congratulation for making ep 10 and now we all want ep 11 as soon as possible ok we know you can do it
Pls revive charmander plssshes my fav
congrats this series is amazing i'm surprised it din't took u more time champ :D
this was awesome. I can't wait for episode 11. I forgot charmander died which sucks.
this is what we get after 2 years
Arusiusu, god of gods..  .. .. .. *ARCEUS*
Wait so squirtle wrote pokebible?
Dammit. I'm so sad Charmander died. He tried to change and then he was killed before he got to show Squirtle he changed. Dammit.
When I first watched episode nine, I thought Mewtwo was going to bring Charmander back because Charmander needed to still deal with Missingno. I was wrong, but this still was a really cool episode, even if Charmander isn't coming back.
this series got dark
Part 11 plz
Now we just wait 2 more years... For another episode heh
The fact that Charmander died hurts me so much i’m crying
Did this Just went from Pokemon to god of war?
WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE?! Also, how will he try to fix everything? Time travel or something?
And the moment we step further into the abyss, the episodes will get darker, darker and even darker still until we start loving this even more.
It's a shamed that charmander died, he's my favorite starter pokemon
Very nice very nice
Was waiting for this ! Less goooooooooooo!
🔥
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Amazing episode!!! What if bluey ask the gods that red should had picked charmander over him to fix it?
YESSSSSSSSSSS
The snover gives me Naruto vibes.
what 5 more years to see the final ep
I didn't understand Caterpie's final line. Was it a message about being careful what you wish for? Squirtle is so powerful that he can give you anything you want, almost like a genie. So anyone who would wield such power would get what they think they want, but it'll never make them happy.  Was that the point?
YESSSS ITS OUTTTTTT!!!!
I miss charmander and bulbasaur
and now we have to wait another two or three years for the next part
Next episode coming in 2035
Okay wait Charmander is dead so all character development was pointless
This was Amazing! Now let's wait another couple years for the next part. (Lmao)
The end credits song was dope... Anyone know if I can find it somewhere else and if so where?
THIS EPISODE MESSED ME UP
Yo I've been waiting this thing for my entire life and its finnaly here And that music when wartortle goes berserk is just woww
Old man squirtle
Why is this actually ridiculously sick now?
tbh I never liked Pokemon but for some reason I like this show
Yesss ep 10. I wait for 1 year
This Was worth the wait AND I LOVE IT CONGRATS ON THE 10TH EPISODE I LOVE THIS
that abomasnow sounds like the ted-ed guy
"Ten years later" it sure did feel like 10 years
It’s always the day I check back on this series that a new episode comes out. I haven’t been more excited for another episode :)
I AM IN FUCKING HIGHSCHOOL
FINALLY
How did we went from “The Adventures of Charmander and Friends” to “Squitle: The Last Ronin”?
omg its happening
So is Bulbasaur still alive? He’s all I care about.
What does the Kanjis on the charmanders hat mean in english?
Its been so long ive missed this
nooooooo not another cliffhanger
legend says mewtwo is fighting this glitch
ABOUT FUCKING TIME MAN!!!!!!!
Can you please make episode 11 very soon
Wait that’s STARTER SQUAD 10?!
what a good series-
OH  YES
Wait did i just see mewtwo fighting that data error thing? Ten years after?
(Ep. 11)
He’s finally coming into his own. Poor guy, so broken...  That said, well worth the wait!
FINALLY MORE VIDEOS!!!!
I think anybody thought you two enough flashback of water the Pokemon the legendary Pokemon called you to anybody starred in the fly back car started uninstall the first time that I thought of the second time watching it again
24:09 when the hell did wartortle become kratos from god of war 🤣🤣
:)
What about Charmaine dyingp
I love this
Great but the thing that charmander died is so bad imo
OMG FINALLY
Squirtle: ah shit here we go again
been waiting over a year for this...
After a whole year finally
congrats on the release of ep 10.I was waiting the whole  time.😀😀😀
I'm callin' it. Dialga rewinds time and Squirtle saves Charmander
I wonder how long until ep 11
I don't care about charmender, but the fuck is your crime ditched bulbasaur like that.
I can’t wait till episode 11
Finally letssss goooo waited forever for thus
Finally
Well now it’s time to wait another bloody year for the next one
plot twist: in episode 8 we see charmander bodies, what if a ghost possesed one body then thats the charmander we see now but the real charmander has been grinding and meets squrtle at the top of the mountain.
resurrect charmander
that was awesome!! a lot better!!
And turtwig is my new favorite character
Took a big risk actually killing Charmander, but it paid off. I hope this will receive an actual conclusion!
Rip charmender
MY CHILDHOOD RETURNS WELCOME BACK MY MAN
Ok time to wait for a few more years for the next one and figure out where this story is going.
YES IT'S FINALLY HEREEE
oh boy can't wait to see how charmander survived and how the starter squad joins together to beat the glitch!   .....  dear god they are all dead
wow nice job
How many years till episode 11
Did Squirtle become the avatar when he evolved? Why do Wartortle's eyes glow when he's angry?
NOOOOOO CHARMANDER
Make a part 11
Beautiful work as always, shippiddge! I adore this series, the work and talwnt put into it is astounding and i will applaud such til the end of days
What did Caterpie mean when he said Squirtle wasn't afraid of him and that he pities the next person that gets control of him
What happened to charmander, I want charmander back in this series😰😰😰😰😭😭😭😭
Two more episodes ago this feels like watching Hellsing abridged. Each episode of that series came out one per year. I will be here on the next one
This series is amazing
Wooooah
Well, Squirtle lvl 98 would delete that snow but looks like we needed to see a badass wartortle delete the entire data of snow lmao
Someone give this guy a Netflix show ASAP
What happened to Charmander Tho
This was magnificent
All I did is just put a single period and I find this video and it was the top ten search results. The title and thumbnail made me laugh my ass off🤣
WAIT WHAT YOU UPLOAD ANOTHER VIDEO!?!?! OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH
Wow it’s sad that this series has gone downhill, I expected better
Well gentlemen, I’ve done the math. At this current rate of production, we can expect to get episode 11 in another 2 years. (Unless they be pulling one on us) Until our paths cross again…
When will start a squad episode 11 get released
IT IS HERE  AND ON TRENDING
Tbh, not a fan. Charmander may have started everything, but this feels like a giant middle finger to him and to mewtwo. I would have rathered this be posted after charmander saved bulbasaur and squirtle, then helped mewtwo, even if that would have made it predictable.
Its out. Awesome video! Cant wait for the others.
I'm really happy that the 10-episode came by I'm sad that Charmander died by really like the animation but what about Mewtwo and that glitch monster is Mewtwo going to fix all of this
FINALY
We waited so long for this? Awful
epic
If anyone makes a “you say run” version I will subscribe to you immediately
ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I hope his old video the starter squad can continue I really enjoyed it lol
The only thing I dislike about this... "To be continued" Everything else was amazing, can't wait for the next episode
who all were waiting for this episode, like
Chimchar is like Charmander but spoiled and entitled. Charmander was jaded by Red's rejection and that made him think deeply about what he wanted and how to get it. He wanted to prove he didn't need a trainer to get strong and he struggled for it both physically and emotionally. Chimchar was mean, stupid, and childish.
NOOO I WANT CHARMANDER TO BE ALIVE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
After days.. years.. centuries.. THE ANTICIPATION... its finally OUTT!!!1111
Yessirr the wait was so worth it lesss goooo
I still can't believe Charmander is fucking dead.
I love the little ice tree guys
So many things to say  1) Why is everyone calling the bidoofs beavers, even the bidoofs? 2) He's still a squirtle after a decade! 3) Dat fearow is fucking weird 4) wow thought that hat was a backpack 5) Dat thing is a tree 6) Lol I forgot about Mewtwo 7) I disliked chimchar the most thus far anyway 8) That ending was pretty fucking metal 9) oh wow u got Dane, idk u 2 knew each other, I used to watch your videos back to back
CHARMANDER IS GONNA COME BACK!!!!!!  SQUIRTLE IS GONNA ASK THEM TO BRING HIM BACK!!!! I have a strong feeling for that
Ugh, i dont like these snorunts  "Cold people are no match for hot people"  *I think I love these guys*
For a parody series of Pokémon, things are starting to be taken more seriously in this series.
"WAIT WAIT WAIT NONONO!" 1 year later i work for a worm who killed my friend
i watched this series for charmander and him only, but hes gone, so i am to
why is it has been two years
YESSSS
When you realize charmander and Bulbasaur had an important mission at Cerulean Cave but that was 10 years ago
6:43 😳
Finallly
Please do others for the starter Squad do more evolving
I've enjoyed this series so much. Just watching it looks like an actual pokemon show. The animation has improved so much and has shown how pokemon see humans instead of how we see them. The character development of Squirtle...I mean, Wartortle has grown better.
Dang I meant episode 11
Guess I have to wait for another 2 years for episode 12 or maybe 3 years
I feel bad for how many stuff Squirtle dealed... he needs a good ending
Dang, can't wait for ep. 11. This was intense.
Why do you create a world where we have to decide whether or not we want I be owned and fight Amongst ourselves to inflict suffering
I am shook by this comeback, it's been so long that I didn't think the series would ever be continued! Though I can't help thinking that the story would be less extreme if they had Revives or Max Revives!
when is the next episode
12:51 umm was that-
Why won't Squirtle evolve
Fu** he is Dead
Finally!!! And it was a great chapter with an epic final! Worth the waiting
It's has been a while for me to wait for a new episodes
I sense that wartortle is going to ask for charmader and bulbasaur back.
Finally
ITS HERE
OOAAOOAOAOAPAOAOAOAOAO
When can we expect the next episode
Welp, see you in another 1-2 years
In case no body's said it yet, shout out to the Snovers; every second on scene was 100% gold!
12:40 I feel so much angry looking at death charmander head that i will now go on a caterpie massacre
YASSSSSS
YES THE DAY HAS CAME I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER
No way dude 😍🥺 Warturtle is fucking brutal lol
ABOUT FUCKING TIME
Will next episode take another couple years
They way he says that "he always had a choice, but decided to let himself get controlled by someone else" reminds of Undertale since YOU are the one controlling Frisk, the character, and YOU are the one to make the choices. So ironic. In other words, the Gods we're never *the ones in control.*
I know they tried to replace charmander with chimchar but pls, charmander was irreplaceable and we also want bulbasaur back And idk why they didn't go through with the Mewtwo missingno line....it was much much better and more interesting
https://youtube.com/channel/UCKATsITZa0KTtRsmH38UKqQ
does this series hate fire types now?
I miss charmander :"c
in this video, squirtle looks so old but i know it was ten years later and hes literally like level 90 something
I was a sophomore when the last ep came out and now I’m a highschool graduate 😭✋🏻
Bruh how did this take 1 whole year It's still gud tho
I really hope the next 2 will be good
He’s back
Wartortle Yeeeeeesss
12:50…was that intentional?
You're back! Yes!!! :D
So bulbasaur is just chilling out here n some random place
It's a good time to be alive.
8:07 wow more reason to hate squirt
please we want charmander back
Pls be a part 11
i really want that catterpie dead
when the world needed him the most, he came back.
When you first started this I was 10 years old   now a mans 18
My favourite superhero Blue shell man guy
I watched this 19 minutes after it came out I remberd when I watched the 1 to 9 strter squad this is amzing can not wait for more to come out. 😀
AMAZING. I NEED MOAAAAAAAR!
Am I the only one who’s feeling like they’re missing something
I'm so happy that this came out on this day because today is my birthday 🎉
3RD ON TRENDING LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
THAT TREE IS SPAZKID!!!! Dude this is awesome!!!!
No... you always had a choice... GODS didnt kill anyone.. YOU DID    Top 10 Famous last heard words
I can’t help but feel like the ending is gonna end with a reset of the world
childhood came back
waithing for over 3 years and finaly it came!
Too bad we didn't see pidgeotto in the flashbacks
YASSS
Yes finally it's here
“I thought you were dead!”  Shippiddge: “My Death was greatly exaggerated!”
ITS ABOUT FUCKING TIME
I gotta be honest, felling a bit more depressed after the death of charmander, looking forward to the next one!
Great job i have all ways loved this series and when I saw that this came out I was so happy you made my day thanks 😀
Best episode ever
You uploaded it as I was looking for it
I can’t believe it’s finally here
I got so sad when I realized Charmander had died, and now Squirtle is the main character which is now Wartortle, but besides that the writing and story is still 10/10, super good series I'm glad to see again.
Im gonna be over 30 by the time the next episode hits.... yay for evolving lols
Well. This is definitely not where I expected us to go. I can't say I'm completely surprised- as far as Charmander's fate. But holy crap, Squirtle-Wartortle, you were the best and you still are the best! So happy I waited!  Although, it's funny how Wartortle wants to complain to the "gods" about the rules, even though things went wrong because SOMEONE decided to start breaking said rules. Silly as this world is, less Pokemon die when they follow the rules, especially the "no killing" one.  I think my favorite part has to be Turtriwg's comment at 8:20-8-26. LOL So freaking true watching this series objectively.
HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!
I think in the next season mewtwo may use a revive item on charmand and turn him into charizard to stop squirtles rain of terror upon the gods
3:58 me towards my lvl 15 Pokemon while my starter  Squirtle (Blastoise) is at lvl 38
2:57 Roasted 😅😂😅😂
Huh... i... was expecting something more around Episode 9 instead.
One episode every 3-4 years now
Make a plot twist Squirtle finds Charmander in the different regions
Finally after a year
I was confused on how come squirtle didn't evolve for ten years  until i noticed The Everstone he has on as a necklace then they literally said it, plus the Dark circles under his eyes so he must be pretty old or needs sleep.
This is my first time ever seeing this series and it's a comedy goldmine...  I died at *"this attack seems a little excessive….!" Lmao*
Time to wait another 2 years for another ep.
Amazing! Can't believe it's been 2 years since the last episode (and 8 since the series began).  Well, see you again in 1 or 2 years for the next part!
FINALLY AFTER 3000 YEARS!
IM A BIRD TWEET TWEET
all these years,was it worth it? yes.
Lol "Pinsir" voices Wartortle :P .  Ya know? "Ohhhh no.... IS THIS A FKN POKE BALLLL!?!?!"
Press F for Charmender and Chimchar.
please keep these coming im loving these episodes
i hope me in the future will see this comment when the series is finished
Finally
I’m so sad that Charmander died :(
I don’t think charmander actually died
Caterpie realized Squirtle feared himself, cause he feared himself figuring out that he killed Charmander and it was his fault. That’s why Caterpie pities Squirtle’s next trainer as well - Squirtle will use him as a cudgel to escape his accountability!!
Ive been watching these for YEARS now, I love this series and glad your still doing it. i was so young when I watched the first episode
It starts with Charmander being salty that he wasn't picked as a starter and ends with squirted killing god.
Lit 🔥
So happy rn
Snover was the best character tbh
Finally episode 10 is here
I wonder what happened to bulbasuar
Remember when everyone thought charmander won't die?    *y e a h . .*
Ok I’m happy it’s back but I’m shocked I thought charmander survived
WTF charmander is dead
Uendmfjdudjudvwheh yesssssssssss i wanted this yes
Excellent work really .
I miss charmander
THX FOR THIS
Poly twist this was all a dream
NO FUCKING WAY!
Squirtle/Warturtle is the most strongest he is the only one that actually made it alive and strong. I’m proud of him 😌😌
20:55 this is Really the part that got me thinking, Did Caterpie actually at least realize Charmander was always the Answer to their Actions and ways of Killing other Pokémon, if he didn’t Die and their deal was made, none of this would’ve Happened and this makes me think does Caterpie actually at least Realize that if Charmander wasn’t killed none of this would’ve happened and Charmander could’ve stayed in the Ball and at least play it safe, I’m not so sure of what they would’ve done to him if he went in the Ultra Ball but I do think that it would’ve gaven Caterpie a better Answer to her big Ugly Problem.
This came out of nowhere and im glad
_spits out water upon seeing this_ ANOTHER ONE?!?!? YAY!!!! <3
24:24 I really love the beat to that music what’s it called??
Finally you did it
God of Wartortle
It’s here
Yes, finally
That was awesome I have waiting on this
20:18 The only way to fix all this is to go back in time,by Restarting the game in the beginning of the game.📺🌌 🎮⏰
I genuinely believe charmander became a ghastly or haunter
Kinda wanted to see charmander evolve lowkey
the main character charmender died? this is the first time i see a main character died
Squirtle: Being overprotective due to PTSD Turtwig: I literally don't know Chimchar: being annoying
I KNOW quality takes time and it shows but Bro PLEASE don’t keep us waiting to long 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
What if Wartortle might ask to bring back Charmander back to the goddess?
22:24 Me when I have spawn protection
I know it’s been a hard week for two because the episode 11 I really wonder how this is gonna be?
"you have chosen death" "yes, but not mine"
Its back
Finally
i dont know why but the grass looks wierd
Me: So excited for this new episode! Wonder what happened to Charmander!  *Episode starts and it’s a decade later, Charmander actually died, the story is 10x darker now and has taken a whole 180 Me: *windows XP error sound
FINALLY
Beautiful
Oh boy another 2 years after this 20 minute video i guess i have to be patient
NO WAYYYYH
16:47 I thought some button icons were to come out...
This episode feels like a fever dream compared to the last 9. Not complaining, that was dope!
Bruh Why did the creator have to kill Charmander that's fucking bogus
This series legitimate scarred me for years when I first saw it as someone way to young to be online now I’m just impressed
Beyond well done! This was amazing!!! 🤘🤘🤘👏👏👏
Finally I forgot about this channel and came back
Just saying… This started 8 years ago
Omg bruh I was waiting for this for flipping 2 years
What about mewtwo and missingo? Will wartotle ever go to the cave to mewtwo ;-; can mewtwo go to past then he can save charmander and bulbasuar and even make him not in the hand of that noob cater.   And then? They can go to kill missingo? In the last episode :0
Pls make a part 11 pls
nice
finally after 2 years ep.10 comes up
Make them faster!
It took a year fo this to come out,was it worth it…maybe Edit:it was worth the wait
they still make new starter squads? damn its been a while
What an emotional roller coaster. Great job guys!!!
[17:49] “Defeated to Death! You can tell because there are X’s where the eyes should be” ~ Mountain Guardian Abomasnow” XD lol I dunno why I love that line so much  Anyways, I love the video and can’t wait to see the conclusion to the series
Thanks for making a video, only took two years, I can’t wait another two years just to see 30 minutes of editing
12:34 Jeezus Caterpie has writing on the back of Charmanders head oooof
and this kids, is why you've always gotta pick the fire starter xD
Why can't Charmander live
omg i cant wait for the ep 11
What happened to Mewtwo? What happened to Bulbasaur? What happened to Missingno? Is Charmander still alive?  I have so many questions
What I'm expecting is that the next episode is probably gonna be focused on Bulbasaur with the last having them meet at the top of the mountain somehow
and now I await the gods of time and space to collide with Mewtwo to reverse time and solve the issue of missingno
When it revealed that caterpie wore charmanders head as his/her hat I felt 20 emotions went flying down my spine
Finally, god damnit
Why do I have the feeling that Charmander might actually have turned into a Gastly now
Yo I legit jumped outta my seat when Squirtle went super saiyan! This episode was OUTSTANDING
that was awsome ur one of da best animators on yt
7:58 Oh jeezus lord Christ it’s Charmanders asulted head ;-;
Honestly I know we only have two episodes left, but this really did feel like the start of season 2!
Is charmander still dead
Great Episode now the real question is how long are we gonna have to wait till the next episode lol smh!
HOLY SHIT!!! THIS IS BADASS AND AFTER ALL SQUIRTLE WENT THROUGH, HE FINALLY EVOLVED!!! I HOPE HE EVOLVES INTO BLASTOISE IN EPISODE 11 AND THEN EVOLVES INTO MEGA BLASTOISE IN EPISODE 12!!!! AND I ALSO HOPE BULBASAUR RETURNS AS VENUSAUR IN EPISODE 12!!! REALLY LOVED THIS!!!!
HE FINALLY EVOLVED!!!
My God just when i thought I was going to never see this, Lord Shippiddge forgive me
Please...... DON'T EVER END THIS SERIES!!!!
I've waited 4, no, 5'000 years for this
Gasly: GWAH Charmender: Oh yeah i better turn into one of theese things
Oh my got charmander
What if they use a revive on charmander and have him fight warterule
6:14 YASS HIS NAME IS STILL BLUEY 😂😇😂😇😂😇😂😇😇😇😇
That abamasnow guy was awesome, gave me chills when he'd speak.
wait if charmander is dead what gonna happened to mewtwo that waiting to Charmander ?
RIP charmander. 😭
4:06 I love how the Bidoof has the fainted swirly eyes XDD
This ep takes a 5/10 because since charmander was my favourite characther in the entire series this get a very low score
imagine he asks for everyone back and thenthey could be a team of pokemonm as we have charmander cimchar turtwig bulbasaur and squirtel now we just need another water type or any type and we have a full pokemon team
Can't wait for part 11 in 3 years 😁
Just seeing Caterpie wearing the head of Charmander makes me hate Caterpie forever.
After waiting for one Year for the next episode it is finally here! HYPE!!!
this be a grand halloween indeed
Why is this a world class animation… and the story man… better than any pokemon movie I’ve ever watched..
Bring charmender back pls 😭😭😭😭
I love this!! I can’t wait to see more!!
CHARMANDER!! 😭😭😭😭
0:46 I love Chimchars voice lol
dang this is the best digimon episode ever.
Holy shit its here
It has been 3,000 years...
Oh my god that was so cool! This whole story so far has had me at the edge of my seat since it began. And now its in overdrive from here! I cant wait for the next!
HOLY CRAP YES IVE BEEN WAITING
Holy shit Shippidge, this was awesome. You made me laugh my ass off in the beginning of the series and got me to care by the end. Squirtle finally evolving to symbolize his growth and not be a follower anymore was great and I also loved how you made Abomasnow a holy protector to be the ultimate authority  Squirtle had to overcome. Can't wait to see where this goes next.
When wortortle just jumped into the air then put shell first into the abomasnow monster all I could here is *you got shell-shocked*
FINALLY! just a year 😌
man Squirtle evolving is like a main character unlocking his full power
So cool
it’s sad to see Charmander go but this is been amazing 10 out of 10 this entire series and everything in this new episode looks so good like I’m just surprised at how good it looks
If Wartortle can beat a monster chosen by the gods, I choose to believe Blastoise will beat said gods
It’s probably gonna take 2 years for the next one
This Story Did A One Eighteen. Totally Different!
Chimchar sounds like funimations kid trunks or goten
Time to wait another year ig
The wait was so long that I forgot to wait  🤣 . This episode came out of nowhere. Completly forgot about this YT series
All this death, all this destruction, all this turmoil could have been prevented if Neo had just picked the Red Pill
YOU MADE HIM DEAD ANYWAY 😠🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡
WOO HOO LOVE THIS POKE=SERIES
In 12:48 you can briefly see mewtwo fighting the corrupted pokemon
11 plz
ITS HERE FINALLY
As one of those who expected Charmander to die, I didn't expect Squirtle to become the main protagonist in such a way that he did
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! CHARMANDER IS DEAD?! And Squirtle just stood there and watched?! WTFUDGE IS WRONG WITH YOU?!  1: We start off with Chimchar beating the hell out of some Bidoofs for no reason. 2: You basically made Squirtle half as bad as Charmander. 3: You killed Charmander when he could’ve straight evolved into a badass Charizard. 4: We still don’t know wth Mewtwo’s part in all this is. 5: You Squirtle chase off the cutest of the 3 Sinnoh starters, all because, he couldn’t remember their name. 6: The hate relationship they have is too evident.
Finnaly the series is back
It was great but damn now the wait begins for the next one! Lvl 99 Wartortle for the win. The blue made it look like a shiny one
Lezzz goooo finally I waited for months for this
So sad to chimchar, Chimchar is my fav starter
Incredible :)
This is marvelous. although I'm very curios how you are gonna wrap everything up in just 2 more episodes
"ANARCHY WILL PREVAIL" Fucking loved that line lmao
FINALLYYYYYYYYY I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG!
Wow, the way you guys go from comedy into a serious plotline is pretty masterful. I feel like that's hard to do with comedy since it could water down the dramatic moments, but the writing was so seamless that it felt so natural to the progression to where we are now. Wonderful episode!
that was a wait and a half
6:10 bird up
Greg!? Doing voice acting again!? I am so utterly surprised and pleased I can hardly put it to words.
Time to wait another year and a half for another amazing episode of Starter Squad
Aight see you guys next year
The story could only be told by this man, the man of men
oh cool, Pokemon Legends Arceus the movie
2:35 so long gay bowser
Oh my god
Damn, this episode was shocking in a good way. Especially 21:26 - 22:00 based moment on accountability.
This is the only episode that made Meg cry
why did charmander die 😭😭😭
I smell time travel.
You guys put your heart and soul into this one it was definitely worth the wait keep it up and I can't wait to see what happens next God bless 🙏😁
Rip Charmander
great ep see you all in a year for ep11
What if the final 2 episodes are what happens in different timelines where it follows Charmander and Bulbasaur?
Are you going to be releasing the soundtrack for this?
Omg finally been waiting forever 😩
If been waiting for this
That was so good!
ayo it's finally here, after all that waiting it all payed off.
Soooooooo worth the wait!!!!!!!!
Wow... What a delight to watch. To be honest I wasn't the most patient person in my wait, but it was over before I knew it. I was completely engrossed.  THIS WAS WORTH EVERY SECOND OF THE WAIT!
YAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The new characters suck compared to the old ones.
I want the old starter squad back tho ngl
We have all waited so long thank you for episodes 10
See you guys in 2 years.
So pumped for this
When is the next one. I need more
finally after a year a new episode
Waited 2 years for this Also why didn't Chimchar burned Abomasnow (4X weak to fire)
Forgot about this series for a while, just remembered and searched for it, and there’s a new episode today. Damn what are the chances 😂
I honestly did not like it. I think what annoys me most is the inclusion of later gen pokemon.
Is dare more episodes!!!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QugFqahGQRI
Can't wait till late next year or early 2023 for episode 11!!!!!!!!
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THIS WAS AMAZING!!!
Pegasus
Congrats on the new video
Petition For bulbasaur To Return
GREAT  this is a great film i love the flash backs
AFTER A YEAR YESSS :DDDD
charmander or i guess ghastly now is just screaming BLEH cuz its all they say in this universe
squirtle sounds like hop-hop from amphibia
What happened to Charmander?
Imagine, Red, choosing Squirtle led to a spiral of death and abuse.
Make Ep.11
finaly, It was worth the wait totaly XD
Bro noooo charmander was my favorite he always made me laugh and i shed so many tears learning of his death. Caterpie got what was coming to him at the cost of everyone.
Time for another two year wait see you guys in 2023
what happen with bulbasaur??
Hey, apparently the fandom/wikia about the starter squad said that Shippiddge doesn't plan to revive Charmander. They said the source is from Discord. I don't know if this source is real or not. IF it is real, then 😖😢😭. Darth Vader: Nooooooooooo
I wonder what happened to Dirtle. 🤔
cant belive charmader rellay died
Well see y’all in 20 years
Yess new flipping series
WOOOOOOOOO LETS GO IM SO HAPPY RN WOOOOOOOOOOO!
I finished watching just now...  I have to say...  Wow.. I... was not ready for this page...  Its...wow...  This plot is great and wont spoil the feelings it produces...
3 years later.....
Yesss
Did anyone see mewtwo
I miss Charmander
rip charmander f in the chat
Finally ep 10
Thank you so much the wait is over
Finally the next part
I believe giratina will be the final boss
finallly finally
I got a youtube kids add on this video
I AM A BIRD!!!! "BIRD SOUNDS!!!"
I thought everything ended… But it’s back!!
My god these keep getting better. I’m so invested
20:58 took mw time to realise what squirtle was truly afraid,he was afraid of making another wrong choise
It's finally hereeee
Is he going to ask if Charmander’s dead
Ok wait so charmander died and squirtle alive and what happen to bulbasaur?
I refuse to believe charmanders dead
Awesome series bro hope you make a part 11 but if not I understand this is an amazing story that I really hope continues but it is your Decision
Man Mewtwo must be extra pissed Charmander died and Squirtle went to another region and Bulbasaur is too inept to do anything. He's so busy fighting MissingNo. he's probably like "Where the @#$% are those #$%@ing @#$% @#$ @$%Z @#$%?!" but uncensored.
Holy shit what happened?! This is amazing!!
Charmander dead, bulbasaur gone, squrtile broken,
bring the episode 11 fast
There was no need for the deep voice by do appreciate thank god you're back to recording when do you think you're going to record episode 11
Do more
I like Turtwig he should have more development and I hope he'll remains a main cast member.
Is that Caterpie wearing a charmander hide dang.
Cya guys in 10 years!
Loved this, and massive Mystery Dungeon nerd that I am, Squirtles arc really reminds me of Dusknoir. If Dialga's up there too, it'd be real cool if there were a reference to that
This series just keeps getting better and better. This has been a great 25th pokemon anniversary. RIP Bulbasaur and Charmander.
I'm confused this isn't where we left off with episode 9..
In episode 1 squirtle was chill, charmander was rude as hell, and bulbasaur was happy And now squirtle has PTSD, charmander is dead, and bulbasaur is still happy
I’ve been waiting for moment for so long
HIW THE HELL IS SQURTAL LEVEL 98
So sad that it ended
6:09 No one: Not even the local crackhead: Fearow: “IM A BIRD TWEET TWEET”
To think this all started because Red picked Squirtle over Charmander.
Dude I absolutely love you videos im so happy a new one is out cant wait for episode 11 love your content
It’s been too long since the last episode was released. I can’t believe that we’re 10 episodes in
Waiting for this was a pain I got a 100 years old Waiting
I know Squirtle is in Sinnoh now, but could you try to put post Gen 4 Pokémon in like Trubbish/Garbodor in later episodes?
When I heard that he was lv 98 I knew that he was going to evolve but I thought he would evolve into blastoice
I feel like Charmander’s character is ended with his character being unfinished
Finally
Omg it's finally back.
Holy shit! It's not dead!
I would've killed that green bug
Y por esto que siempre hay que elegir a Charmander.
YES!
So is there going to be another 1 year wait?
finnaly
Its been so long
bruhhhhh finalyyyyyyyyy
holy shit.
My eyes couldn't believe what I saw when I searched up starter squad
OMG ITS HERE
I have waited so f-ing long for this
ALQUM BR ESPERANDO O JGDUBLAGENS DUBLAR
Finally!!!!!!
Woah. My mind was completely blown. I'm not a big fan of Pokémon, but this series is amazing. I really can't wait to see what the next episode brings. I know it's gonna be a wait, but given how well this story was written, it'll be well worth the wait. Keep it up and looking forward to the next episode whenever it drops!
ALRIGHT IT’S HAPPENING EVERYBODY CALM DOWN!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT YESSS
It’s been 4 no 500 years
Charmenter 😭😭 my favorite Pokemon
I lowkey miss Charmander. But Wowie was there a lot to unpack here this episode.
Hear me out guys.  WE WANT MORE!!!!!!
6:09 😂
wasnt it 3 episodes left?
All this time mewtwo is still fighting super missingno
I waited 4000 no 5000 years for this
It sucks that bulbasaur and charmander died
this is just the best
What happens next does he climb to the top and find sky pillar or whatever with dialga palkia and arcues
Dang, definitely worth the wait. Definitely one of my favorite series on all of YouTube. Keep up the great work!
Shippiddge killed off Charmander because he told him to make the videos faster.
2 words: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ITS BEEN A FUCKING YEAR ROCK TO FUCKING BOTTOM THIS SHIT GETS UPLOADED
Congrats on trending and ive been waiting for this
Yes
See you all in 2 to 3 years guys!
I speak for all of us when I say this is well worth the wait
I wish charmander is alive
Yes finally episode ten. Now to wait for another year.
Awww I miss charmanderr an Bulbasar
I saw the first episode when I was in elementary 2013 summer I was a done with 2nd grade and now I’m a 11th grader almost done with high school 😂  Did anyone else watch it during elementary and is now in high school?
Another good episode😀 and another year to wait ☹️
See you in 2 years.. man
You to 11
Wow, took a dark turn. I'm here for it!
I watched this is a kid  Stupid squitel decided to side with the bad team  and now started a new team to avenge charmander nice
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
It's finally here!!!
BRO FINALLY
Finally
“Legend of a blue shell man guy”  Squirtle who’s a turtle: 😐
What will you do after starter squad? I’m very interested to know
After 2 yrs of waiting
Squirtle so strong
To mention gen 5 characters for the remakes
Wy did char mandr hafe to die i have ben woching sens the 1 vidio and he was my fafrat
Could Charmander return in the last episode as a Gengar?  Haunter said dying pokemon become Gastly. He could train in the distortion world and finally EVOLVE all the way to a Gengar  maybe Haunter was preparing him in the tower
After a whole year it’s finally here!!! But here’s the question of the day when the next one?
FINALLY GOD DAMNIT ITS FINALLY HERE. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Charmander went so much trouble trying to get Squirtle and dies  man
Finally
I hope Bulbasaur ain't just gone and he comes back in some way in an actually cool way rather than just being a joke, but I'm keeping my hopes low lol
So the whole squad died but squirtle
Imagine charmander just becomes hank from madness combat
IFL this series, I can't wait for what's next
I feel like wartortle will become kratos in the next episode and just kill the gods.
Holy shit, he evolved... WHOOHOOO!
Protagonist: Charmander: episode 1-9 Squirtle/Wartortle: episode 10-12
Finally😞
And this video is trending as #13 incredible!
It’s finally here, can’t wait to watch it!
And now we wait another year for episode 11
Dude I waited 2 years for this it better be good
Man, I lost interest in the series since episode 4 or more soon to it or something, but once this new one came out i managed to binge watch every single part until the big one. Can't wait to see if our new heroes will eventually evolve and go even further beyond!
It feels different without charmander
F of chamarder goodbye Charmander i Love you
HOLY HELL IT'S HERE
IVE BEEN WAITING 2 YEARS FOR THIS SHIIT
Why so long ?
wait level 98 wtf squrtle
hallelujah hallelujah, thank poke Moses the wait is finally over!
We now have Squirtle, Dirtle, and Stickle
He goes up to find Charmander sitting up there and he's the one who decided the fate of chimchar 😂
Finally
Well this was a nice surprise
FINALLY EP 10!
ILoveYou♥Chimchar🔥🈸🙊
theroy up there is going to be arceus and he is going to ask if he can bring charizard back
12:50 - Mewtwo is still fighting the glitch, it isn’t over, and we have two more long ass episodes after this one, I can’t wait! This man should have his own Netflix series
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Geez ive been waiting years!!!
Omg omg omg
This dude needs PTSD counseling
Bring back char and bulb and please add piplup
I was waiting For ever.
OBSESSED! Such a well done series
When the world needed him most... he returned...
This is soooooo sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😭😭😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
Just came here to show that I got here early. Edit: Also sooooooo hyped , I've waited SO long for this, I'm so excited for the future videos of Shippidge
Sweet mother of Arceus up high on Mt. Coronet...THIS WAS AMAZING BEYOND WORDS! To think it's been 8 years since this came out...I was just starting college...AND THE TWO YEAR WAIT WAS WORTH IT! (But plz don't make us wait THAT long or longer for another pretty please?) So much to take in...oh my lord, I hope we can get a few more hints on everything that went down the past decade! Keep it up!
I would like too appreciate the effort you put into releasing this video for us.
I thought this was deed but it's finally here after 2 long yrs
I’m putting my faith into the last episode. I hope…Charmy comes back.
FINNALY
Finally after 500 years
Keep up the good work i wanna see more
OH MY GAWD!!! FINALLY AN UPDATE THANK YOU!!!
If he wins can he wish back everything to go back to normal before Charmander diet and all of this like go back in the past?
Shippiddge.. it's been 1 year of no uploads
Maybe its just me but I hope Charmander is brought back to life somehow....
have already watched 3 times since release i love it
omg FINALLY, you cannot believe how long I've been waiting for this! Overall, I say bravo! This is a great series and I can't want to see how it all goes down :)
This is the 10th anniversary of starter squad. I cant believe this
great video as always shipp.
I think I recognized the beavers voices. They sound exactly like Dawn Somewhere's Elvis character. Which is really obscure even to me...
Finally I’ve been waiting millions of eons
Are the Bidoof dead!?!
gaming
R.I.P charmander 😞
Goddamn. The writing on this is actually stellar. I loved it!
Fucking finally it's here
You do not know how much joy this brought to me it’s been so long
14:39  Just as Snover talks about friends being so replaceable, one Snover replaces another lol
Imagine Bulbasaur breaker out and just chills out all day with snovers
Squirtle kratos lol
It’s not Starter Squad anymore, its Solo Squad… :((
Spoilers         If Squirtle's voice is this deep as a wartortle, I can only imagine how insane he'll sound as a Blastoise.
YO YO YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I like seeing charmander beat the living sh*t out of caterpies
Mmmmmh monkey
Please make episode 11
I have so much emotional pain looking at the charmander hat
It took almost 2 years
Was that a Shin Megami Tensei Refrence??? 24:04
No … :,( Charmander … that chaterpie, … chimchar… Man I’m a mess but man on man this was worth the wait and I’m really sad that squrtile suffered so much… and that charmander is … really gone. But not forever! I can’t wait to see more, awesome work!
Kind of a let down
R.I.P Charmander
Man this was great
Man, when did Pokémon become God of War?
I refuse to believe that Charmander is dead
I thought that Snover sounded so familiar until I saw the credits to see it was Ed Atlin.  The same voice actor in the other animation called "I am a Man" by EpicFaceFist.  Because of this, I can no longer see Snover the same way I use to look at him ever again because of that shaving scene. >_>
This somehow gives me Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explores of Time/Space vibes. LETSGOOOOOO WARTORTLEEEEEE, ONE MORE GOD REJECTED
I didn't want Charmander to die and what's even sadder, Bulbasaur and Mewtwo weren't there to save him. 😢😢😢
The legend was finally reborn
KINO
Squirtle is level 99
Omg
Yay a
I don’t know if this is what I wanted, but I’m excited to see where it gos
Finally, it's been too long!
Lucky for that Wartortle he's level 99 now :) Lesson I learned: Keep ur pokemon to level 98 with everstone and evolve it at level 99 and 100 :)
OMG It’s here! I’m so excited YES!
2 episodes left. This is one of the best series I’ve seen and I can’t believe it’s been so long since the first episode. You really made something so amazing and I hope everything you do goes even better :3
Could someone check my pulse because I think I passed out when I saw this upload
The leader finally gets the perfect punishment....
22:00 So you have chosen... death.
More pls
maybe i missed it but wht happened to charmander and bulbasaur and mewtwo and missingno
backk
Did charmander die?
Is new episode waiting for this for so long
Hope we find out how wartortle ended up in shinno
Time to wait another 5 years for the next episode 😟
where is charmender
But the squad is now broken. I still love this show to death but it still feels wrong.
About fucking time my guy GODS
Can we talk about this man’s dedication. 10 YEARS! Goddamn
I am gonna have to rewatch the series for small details, but it's not necessary
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, Charmanders actually dead... But where or what happened to bulbasaur.
YOOOOO
I fucking hate that they killed charmander
Ive waited so looonngggggg. I love the starter squad. Keep it up
Episode 11  Him: hmmm maybe next year
being slightly bigger changes NOTHING! a minute later ......
Bummed out charmander is gone but this really does open doors. The ending can go either way at this point! Cant wait for the last 2 episodes
SO NOBODY REALIEZD  WHEN MEOTWO WAS FIGHTING MISINGNO?
I dont what to think about this show I hope you bring charmander back please
Damn I think I watched the first ep when I was 7 now I’m 13
Finally after a whole fucking year
ayo chill
Impressive, you managed to release this episode in a brisk less than 3 years
FINALLY
Squirtle might have to battle either dialga or arceus to revive chimchar and they will grant one wish to turn back time to stop charmander from being killed and all three will have to go to cerulean cave for mewtwo’s promise and might battle missinggo and all three will evolve into their final stage instantly and maybe even mega evolve
THIS IS A DREAM, IM IN HEAVEN!!!!1!!!!111111    NO WAY EP 10 IS OUT I AM IN DISBELIEF
12:50 Did anyone else see Mewtwo fight Missingno?
SOMETHING.
Waiting was well worth it
I almost missed that subtle Snover replacement scene at 14:35 - nice touch!
Is it just me or am I the only one who wants to know what happened to bulbasaur
Charmander actually died, bulbasaur stayed behind and squirtle is doing his own things I thought it was just going to be about those main 3 but I guess not
So wait what happened to the missingno arc? Or will that be revealed later?
This is truly the most betraying fucked up twist of all time, yet I forgive you shippidge :).
yooooooo
I was expecting funny. I left with tragedy
I love how instead of lvl 100, squirtle was lvl 98 with an everstone. Which if you know, you can evolve if you leveled up once  meaning that squirtle is now level 99
honestly wasn't excepting charmander to do at any point. the wait was well worth it and cant wait for episode 11 and 12. hopefully it wont be as long as a wait as this episode was
No charmander cant be dead
IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
See you later in 2026. Dope video 🙌🏿👍🏿🙌🏿😂
This was worth the wait. So much has changed from the humble beginnings. I’m looking forward to what’s next.
Thank
Finally
Notify me when Charmander comes back.🥲
Next episode in 2025 😂🙌🏻
If Chimchar and Turtwig were there with Squirtle, then where is Piplup in this episode. Can someone give me an answer why Piplup is not there with Squirtle, Chimchar and Turtwig.
YO I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD COME OUT BUT FINALLY AFTER SO LONG, THE EPISODE WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR IS FINALLY HERE
Im surprised they actually killed Charmander off
IV'E BEEN WAITING FOR  THIS
More Please XD
Yooo that was Amazing! Definitely worth waiting!
holy shit it's here
This made me kinda sad that char is actually dead but I think he might come back because blue shell guy man went to the mountain to get gods to bring him back I dunno because I can't belive he just died just like that:/
Nice!
So do we have to wait another couple months possibly years?
OOooh. I’m excited to see where this all leads.
Fighting Pokegods...  When the fuck did this become God of War?
Si what happend to bulbasaur
The snorunt is the guy who voiced Professor Science in Spazkid's PowerTrip video! LOL thats why he sounded so familiar!
YES
pog
ITS FINALLY OUT
Holy shit it's finally here I've waited so long for this
Amazing can't wait for 11
Wartortle is badass. Also please make so charmander comes back from metwo, i will unsubscribe
Yay and it only took 2 years!!
FINALLY, AFTER YEARS WE HAVE THE NEXT EPISODE I have literally been watching this series since i was a kid and now I’m 15 wtf lmao
I have a theory that one of the god is the ghost of charmander
The joke is so subtle 1:40 love it!
please say a revival stone lands on charmanders head and he gets revived
this is not like old starter squad i dont like it its 6/10
Hell yeah, after 2 years of waiting. Y’all finally came back with another banger.  Can’t wait for the next episode/journey 😁
ITS OOOOOOOUUUUUUUUT
yoooo wartotle;s backstory is epic
I hate how i dislike this episode despite how beautifully told the story is, not to mention the flawless animation. I completely forgot life isn’t a fairytale, there isn’t a redemption arc to everything. Having rewatches this whole series it felt way too short despite its length. Honestly perfect
Let’s go!!
Let’s go we back baby
what the f-
Finally youve kept us waiting
Please! Continue the story, this cannot end here! I wish charmander and bulbasaur appeared more
Of course my boy Turtwig is the most sensible, yet apathetic little dose of reality for Squirtle.  Speaking of which, if we are in Sinnoh, there is going to be a Rotom at some point. They are either going to be the most hyperactive prankster SOB, or a solemn little psychopath that is lonely and copes by attacking people as various appliances. There can be no balance. I look forward to their voice.
i need more
Finally it's out
"I don't know why I laughed so much,  that story was just a bunch of death with a really sad ending."   I can think of no better encapsulation of season 1 lol
I was in kindergarten when I watched this now I’m in 7th grade I guess I’m just like Squirtle I can’t accept to grow up but maybe someday I will
Please bring back charmander I miss him so much
It’s not over there’s still 2 more episodes FUCK
so yall really killed off charmander like that
See ya next year
😱😱😱
12:50 Mewtwo is here with the weird glitch thing 0-0
(Finished) WELP 2 MORE EPISODES TO GO NOW TO WAIT AGAIN
The whole point of charmanders journey...THEIR journey was to evolve. Squirtle is the only one who achieved this out of the trio  Charmander died in vain, never reaching this goal. And bulbasaur probably either died of starvation after the war, or he permanently became a living vending machine for the caterpies
This was epic
Cool see you next year
I miss charmander that was my fav character
I’m training my Squirtle to turn into a level 99 Wartortle becuz of this. And if you argue that he’s still level 98 he can’t evolve unless he levels up.
Poor Charmander… ANY WHO MY FAVORITE STARTER IS A LEGEND ~ 🤩
I love the episode but did they really have to change the entire cast in the span of 2 minutes :sob:. Its great to see lore but I really miss the main cast.
Finally!, The wait is over Amazing work
I have been waiting for 2 years
If Time Travel is involved in the next episode, then Celebi has to be in it.
12:51 real attention to detail
Anyone know the impression the Snovers are doing, I know I heard that voice type somewhere else before
I have waited way to long I almost forgot the series
Your backkkkk.
Is there going to be episode 11
I'm excited for episode 11 this is really good quality worth the wait
So happy is this out
Oh. I thought the series died.
NO WAY EP 10 AFTER SO MUCH WAITING FINALY
ive been waiting for over a year this is so legendary
"remember when the trainer didn't choose Charmander?" "What does any of that have to do with this?" *"Everything."*
Wait who was the monkey💀
Yes like 2 years later we get this I hope the next two or three don’t take to long to make
I like the gen 4 approach
Thank God it's trending but 12th on the list I was expecting atleast In the top 10
Who is the Snovers voice reminding me of….I knows it’s an impression but I forget from where
Wait what about the mewtwo storyline
LETTTS GO
Bro just use a revive on charmander
THIS 1 YEAR OF WAITING YOU FINILLY POSTED IT i will remember this in my soul world i hope turtwig will chamge his mind
Noooooo charmander is gone
But… what happened to piplup?
Well time for another 1 year wait
Heck YEAH
Their gonna bring back charmander fully evolved as a prawn of the gods
Personally, I think the episode FREAKIN’ SUCKED. I mean it might be leading up to the next episode, but I very much dislike this episode.
Imagine if squirtle uses revive stone
Honestly. You've outdone yourself, more than you ever have.. This really is a masterpiece of all masterpieces.
I loved the fuckin snow trees☠️
FINALY
“Anarchy will prevail!” Technoblade: not bad, kid
AFTER 2 YEARS AFTER I WAS 8 YEARS OLDDD
Finally after 2 years of rotating in my room waiting for part 10 please don’t don’t take two years again  Also perfect timing now that sinoh remakes are confirmed
It was well worth the wait
LETS GET SHIPP TO 1MIL SUBS!!!!!
rlly had to kill off my man charmander, may he R.I.P ;(
Who else goes watching the series again from the beginning when a new episode comes out and the best part is cause this series must be finished its amazing
The God of War inspired music, narration, cinematography and design was incredible. Your work is a masterpiece. :)
I still just can’t believe it’s out.
Omg yes
Outstanding!!! 💯💯💯
I feel bad for bidoofs
Wellp see y’all in 2022
Low-key glad the Charmander died☠️
Everyone keeps talking about how Charmander is dead. But my boy Mewtwo got fucked over hard when you think about it.
What a wait this was. To think this was first made a long time ago. I guess its obviously not over as we still have episode 11 and 12. Can't wait Ship! Until next time
Yay
I bet it's going to take more years to make the last episode how many years has it been since episode 9
So you saying is I'm changing so I unfinished business forever and forever and forever? Oh man I never going back forever. I'm never be kid forever I never be playing. (...) this is going to be best game forever. 🙂
excUSE ME
Wonder how many people passed away since episode 9 released two years ago that never got to see episode 10? Hopefully we don’t have to wait terribly long for the next.
I wonder what Bulbasaur has been doing…
Make a a pikachu come in
This episode is genuinely saddening
So when's the other 3 eps droppin dude
Finally it is here
expectation: a cool ending to our "little" gen 1 story reality: a whole new kinda universe and an even bigger story to root for :D I hope (but don't expect) not to wait that long for the next ones though ^^ next up are spoilers:        RIP charmander T.T didn't expect that tbh :(
It was sad that Charmander died
I hope that the next or last episode will see Mewtwo again since he wanted the gang to meet up with him somewhere. Or maybe Squirtle did meet up with Mewtwo before the present
After so long we’ve made it to number 10!!!!!! But these animations do seem hard keep the good work up and thank you for 28 minutes of this
When is the next one coming out
2 episodes left guys
This has some major Redo of Healer vibs
Revive charmander an buba sour
Omg we waited for 2 years 😯
The only problem with this is that it isn’t an hour long
OH MY GOSH!!!! CANT BELIEVE! FINALLY EPISODE 10
letsgoooooo
poor Squirtle :c
I missed this
Finally
We need a RPG game of this
No freaking way!!!😱😱
“What will you ask the gods?”  “Something”  Best line ever
Snovers are very cool trees

Victory in Japanese on Charmander's head. Still so dark.
I am so exited for episode 11 this episode was the worth the wait
Charmander is dead?
Hes back yay
Wow, this a big change in the series.
23:47 escanor is typing...
22:21 your dead I have gone through character development
This was AWESOME! And I think Wartortle isn’t just going up for 1 reason I:)
Been waiting for so long 8 first saw this series when I was five I can’t  understand what’s happening
When will next come out
Where is Bulbasaur in this. Also, if Chimchar and Turtwig were there, where is Piplup.
Spoiler      I hope we get to see Turtwig again somehow, I found him interesting.
F for Leonard
I just randomly decided to search for Starter Squad episode 10 while eating and then it showed up like HOLLLLLLYYYYYYYY FUCKING SHIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.
holy crap thank you for making this. amazing work. this is literaraly my childhood. once again amazing work cant wait for 11 and12.
2 years of waiting for 30 minutes...  WORTH IT
#12 on Trending  Congratulations! 😄❤
Celebi is "cute and sweet", so it would only make sense to make Celebi to be a ruthless God...lol
BRUH
OMG FINALLY
👍
I just  started watching episode 10 and I miss bulbersaur and charmander
So, are we going to see Celebi to go back in time in Episode 11 to tie up the Mewtwo/Missingno storyline?
12:07 Am I crazy or is that Movieunleashers?
ive been waiting for this episode ever sense ep 9 came out- omg its finally here tyyyyyyyyyyy
I just saw a Pokemon meme, came to YouTube TODAY! and was surprised to finally see episode 10
I miss Bulbasaur
finallly
Brazilians are sad for Charmander  RIP 😳
Charmander died im out
Finally!! It’s soo good btw
Yoooooo wheres bulbasuar…
To think this all started because Red picked Squirtle over Charmander.
Nice.  Excited to see the story continue!
I’m sad that charmander died
Maybe Squirtle wants to change the past with the help of the Gods? Lets wait for another 2 years😂
This was a good episode, but what about mewto and mising no.? charmander and bulbasaur were supposed to go to the cave to help mewto.
Deep stuff and I'm looking forward to seeing what is found at the top of the mountain!
This is the best one yet omg I love it so much I have so many questions I’m stoked about this one and what happens next I am sad about charmander but I know squrturtle is doing a great job good ending on this one keep up the great work shippage
RIP charmander
THE WAIT IS OVER. IT HAS RETURNED. THE GREATEST POKEMON PARODY OF ALL TIME.
Blue turtle
yeßddsssss
HOLY CRAP ITS FINALLY HERE
i remember when i watched ep 1-9
NOOOO WAY I HAVE BEEN WAITING I BET ITS SO GOOD
Watching this for me it's like the kids who watched Samurai Jack back in the day and finally watch the conclusion of the series when they are much older than before...
It has been 13 years
Was Not expecting a  movie unleashers cameo
EPISODE 10!!!!!!!!  Edit: I GOT A GODDAMN AD RIGHT BEFORE THE FLASHBACK WTF
From a nice little low budget comedy to a clever dark humor filled show to then reveal itself to be an artistic masterpiece. I honestly don't know what to say other than this was worth the wait.
Jeez I think the abomasnow is a little too big and too cocky and a bragger
Squirtle when he evolve becone ultra instinct wartortle
22:58 Best last word ever!
this was deeeeeeeeep! so many instances of art imitating life .... (art was amazing btw) one of my favourite YT series ever especially after this episode, the humour the dialogue the references grew with the viewer.
have you considered doing a q and a on this series? i mean this will probably be a 10 year long project at this point, i'm curious on what this experience has been like in your life
Bring back charmander and 11 episode
This episode makes me feel pain
The animation has improved so much
I’ve been waiting for this for so long  … I honestly feel bad for charmander r.I.p
Its finally out
Now I know why it took so long you worked harder on the animation 👍
“#12 on trending” YES! FINALLY! IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG! WE ALL HAVE!
Really that's it but very nice animation thoe
Ive been waiting forever, its finally here  Edit: I almost gave up on this series  Edit 2: Now that im done watching ill wait another year or 2 for ep 11, lets see how long this takes  Edit 3: Why did u have to kill off my boy charmander
WAIT ITS OUT NO WAY HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN FINALLY
I like how the first flashback really looks like the cartoony episodes of the past but as they go on the flashbacks get more realistic as squirtle accepts reality.      Or the quality difference is due to the fact he aminated work on this for 2 years and the first flashback was made with earlier software
22:24  Abomasnow: Being slightly larger means nothing Dynamax:
Yall do nor know how long I've been waiting
I WAS LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF YESTERDAY
It's always worth the wait whenever these come out.
FINALLY
Despite Squirtle being trapped in the reign of terror for 10 years. He has now put a draw line to his nightmares, \thus makes the incredible trek avenge his people he met, and soon enough will he will enhance himself the new hero.
FINALY
Make more
BEST SERIES ON YOUTUBE! LOVE YOU!!!💜💜💜
Yes I been waiting this for months
12:50 we need to see this epic battle in full
12:49 dude still glitching💀
It's masterful.....gen 4 eh? Time travel shenanigans are about to occur :D
Damn just seeing Charmander’s head on the Caterpie head is disturbing since he was one of the main protagonists of the series and now he’s just gone like c’mon man why
wow so charmander really died R.I.P for the fire pokemon startes.
Time to wait another 2 years for the next episode.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the king has returned
I absolutely love that Wartortle is in the spotlight and I'm going to be sad when he becomes a lvl 100 Blastoise but I'm not really a fan of the voice. I hope it's like meeting a new Doctor where I don't like them at first but it'll grow on me as the show goes on.
For crying out loud I make your videos faster
Omg, this is so good!!! I can’t wait for the next one. Honestly, you must spend a lot of time doing these, I don’t know how big your production team is but you’re all putting in some serious time and I personally appreciate you all for it!
OMG finally out
This episode was so good it got a spot on trending
ive been waiting so long also I like the beavers
this episode was good the bad side is where was bulbasuar?
What happened to caramander
We need charmander and bulbasaur back 😭😂
Wait is this the last episode?
We followed charmanders story but now we will follw Squirtles story. It’s like poetry
Time  too wait another 2 years to wait for episode 11 but it's going to be good
warturtle's ability: [badass] description: the more serious the pokemon gets the more stronger they become, no matter who the opponent is even if they are stronger this ability instantly gives warturtle buffs that defy the opponents even if they have a type advantage
A really great episode. This wasn't where I was expecting the series to go, but it is a really interesting turn. I feel like making a prediction (or at least my guess) about what is going to happen in the future episodes.  (Spoiler warning if anyone is reading this before watching the episode)  Wartortle is going to go through another trial concerning his past while he climbs to the mountain summit, perhaps this will be in the form of meeting Whiskers, Caterpie, or Bulbasaur and finding out how things have changed for them since they last saw one another (I would personally bet on it being Bulbasaur if this is the case, as it would force Wartortle to look back on how he did nothing to help another previous friend, while also helping to strengthen his resolve in finding a way to change things, especially since Bulbasaur would likely join him for the remainder of his adventure as his friend).   Once they get to the top of the mountain, the group will have to deal with Missingno and Mewtwo's fight against it. Either because of defeating it, or through something Missingno does, Wartortle will be sent back in time to the point where he could have saved Charmander from Caterpie and this time choose friendship over loyalty. Not sure exactly how it will go down, but I think Squirtle will save Charmander (potentially taking the hit for the fire type in the process, and furthering Charmander's resolve to do things together as a team of friends) and Charmander will take down Caterpie either alone (before tending to Squirtle's injury and saving him if Squirtle did take a life threatening blow), or alongside Squirtle alowing the original trio to continue their adventures like they did before, only with a newfound sense of comrodery and respect for one another and their views.
Did anyone notice the caterpie did exactly what they said they would do in ep. 4?  They wore Charmander’s parts, fed off of Bulbasaur, and since Squirtle wasn’t kidnapped by them, he ended up being free
Guess ill wait another 2 years oh and, your editing and animation has gotten alot better
I AM A BIRD" favorite line ever
Shippiddge.When is episode 11 coming out because I really want to see it and I will subscribe and by the Ally team
It’s finally here

Chimchar sounds like Caterpie
The legend has appeared
"But wait! You can't go that way. That path runs through Snow Way and you'll never make it through Snow Way."   "Why not?"   "There's snow in the way!" LOL
*M u t u a l l y  a s s u r e d  d e s t r u c t i o n*
Literally started watching this while i was like 6 years old, im 12 now
This has to be the worst one of them
Lets oooooooooneeeeee yeeeeeeeaaaar more for the next videeeeeeoo
I'm so happy for this
I'm nt interested in this anymore y'all killed off my favorite character charmander......charmander is the reason y I always watched now he's no longer apart of the series😑😑😑
I liked how the snover found another snover for a replasement for turtwig
WOAHHHHH
Wtf is this garbage
I completely forgot about this series ngl. 2 episodes left
Finnally
Lol
Now its 2 more episodes
felt like we actually waited 10 years
BRUH NOOOOOO THIS WAS SO GOOD NOW I GOTTA WAIT ANOTHER YEAR TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE
We have been waiting THANK YOU
Dawnsomewhere wtf
I loved it with every fiber of the pokefan in me I loved it. How do I help contribute to the process of ep 11
5 years ago when i was in first grade I watched the first episode and now im watching the 10th episode and going to wait 3 more years for the next two
See you in the next 2 years for ep 11.
I have a feeling he will see Arceus and some other god Pokémon like dialga and palkia because they are gods aren’t they. also he said creator of god and time that’s dialga and palkia.
Congratulations, Please Make More Videos, I Can't Wait!!XD
I can’t wait until the next episode keep up love your videos
When I first saw Starter Squad I was a junior in high school, laughing at a psychopath Charmander shivving a Caterpie  8 years, 4 years of college, a year in quarantine, and many many hours questioning my life decisions later, I sit here crying over a Squirtle with PTSD  Bravo, you brilliant bastards  You made the wait well worth it and I can barely wait to see what the future holds
Wait what happened to charmander ?😥
Charmanders probably a Gengar by now
I love rewatching these. Its fun to see how the animation quality has slowly but surely improved, which only makes the animations that much more enjoyable. Nice job!
Mewtwo fighting Missingno at 12:50  - just a flash. Hmmmm... Squirtle did see Mewtwo in his flashback, but he didn't know about the deal to meet at Cerulean Cave. Char und Bulba got this information.... well, I hope this storyline will also be continued. So many questions!!! o_O  As always - thanks for your awesome work!!!
Omg Finally it’s been a year waiting for this
Yeah but still love it man pls keep making vids like dis
Only one question remains - will he remember to head to Cerulean Cave or did Mewtwo give up on that after the ten year wait...
What does it say on the back of charmanders head
would’ve been cooler if charmander didnt die and he evovled edit:i change my mind
Well it’s fucking goooooooooooooo
Why do I feel like Blue Shell man guy is going to go full Kratos on the PokéGods
YES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS THANK YOU
When is part 11 coming out
Squirtle: Level 1: Squirtle Level 25: Squirtle Level 50: Squirtle Level 75: Squirtle Level 90: Squirtle Level 95: Squirtle Level 98: Squirtle Level 99: Wartortle Level 100:
Damm I didn't think they would actually kill Charmander like that
Finally
Amazing I have been waiting for this for a long time
I’m glad chimchar died
This and gumbino returning today has made my day
Keep making these videoa
I just started but still where’s charmander and bulbasuar
Meanwhile the humans : ay watch I got a strong pokemon  other person: ok fight me
Yoooo I remember watching this😂
AMAZING JOB WOW SO GOOD
I love this Blue Shell Man Guy episode <3 Thx <3
this is great but why was it so long to make?
Jesus squirtle is a beast
Poor Charmander
Make charmander come to life please
Thank god they are not associated with nintendo or game freak. Cause then we would not have gotten this gem. been waiting for over 2 years! Amazing!
Uhh yeah not a bad episode. But seriously? Now this "op" Wartortle is the main character? Also I kinda find it stupid that Caterpie managed to win. Like seriously? Charmander doing all that killing stuff is bad. But being ordered to do it by a bitch worm who's to scared to fight himself? Sorry that does not make Wartortle look "epic"
Hold on is charmander really dead because we saw him alive in the video "three episode left".
Don't forget about Missingno!
26:21 why is there agumon
Holy crap this was so good!!
I already liked Snover but now with that personality makes it 10 times better
Wow its out
Seriously if this is what he is like when he is a Wartortle then what will he be when he is a Blastoise
HECK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!
I shall spread the legend of blue shell man guy!
FINALLY ITS HERE
FINALLY ITS HERE!
ITS HEREEE!
These episodes have actually evolved into mini movies
I didn't expect this when I woke up this morning. Thanks for making my day.
Am I the only one who's disappointed
I was going to say it took so long for a single video but I can’t even be mad this was just to good 👌
Years later new episode me like 14 dam seven year old me liked this
Finally...
This was amazing
Charmander really is gone! 😭  What a DAY to be a Pokemon fan though! A new Starter Squad episode on the same day that we got another Pedro Araujo Red episode. 🙌🙌
Dont y'all love waiting all that time just to finish it and wait some more god I love this app     Also that was a amazing episode good job 👍
Bibi gives me Tommy Chong vibez and I love it 🤣
When God hurts you for character development ;)
Yessss
Pokémon God of War

Poor Charmander :(
Welp see you all in another 2 years
Awesome video  See you guys in 2 years lol
fuc this show went from homicidal satire to epic emotional turmoil and character development... this fucker better keep making more!!
Ight, love what you’re doing, but also fuck your for your perfect cliffhangers
Did Squirtle just evolve into God of Wartortle?
Can’t wait to part 11
I found out Chimchar looks like Charmander and sounds like it and it acts like it and it's violet
I am expecting Charmander will return.. As a GHOST pokemon... Or maybe as a sentient dream.
The wait was worth it
ITS HERE FINNALY
Absolutely brilliant and well worth the wait!
Omgggg soooo worth the wait 🤘💯🧡 thanks for posting this before my bday tomorrow. Greatest gift of all 💯💙
Did anyone notice that caterpie is wearing charmanders head as a hat
I cant wait for episode 11 I watched this when i was like 7 and I loved it and I still do keep it up man!
WHAT!
Thx for this
11:53 Chumdar
I’m glad this is back
Ahora 2 años más para el cap 11
Not Charmander!!! Damn it... who's going to be the angry lizard now?!
Bro what took so long kept us waiting
I can’t wait till 2023 for the next episode, each one gets better and better.
Charmander is dead? well this sucks
What is your episode 11 AND 12
Holy shit that was a Fucking Turn.
def worth the wait, cant wait to see the next ep
FINALY
In episode 11 plz bring charmander back to life
since he evolved he's now lv 99 1 level to go to become ultimate blastoice (be funny if he finds his mega stone on way up)
Finely
FINALLY
FINALLY!!!!
c- charmander and chimchar are both dead turtwig is gone cant way to see bulbasour and turtwig return and charmander and chimis revival
episode 11 is gonna legendary
Seeing Lyle and Shippiddge still working together all these years after Beans brings this old fan some warm feelings.
WHAAAAAAAAAT? BUT CHARMANDER- AND THE WAR-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WHAT WAS ALL THAT? it was good but literally the last thing I expected
YES AFTER 2 YEARS THANK YOU SHIPPIDGE
Thank god charmander died. He was a menace and deserved it.
FINALLY ITS OUT STARTER SQUAD EP. 10 IS OUT
Yessssssssssssssssssss!!!!
Welcome back
Perhaps an onpopular opinion, but...does anyone else kind off misses the old Starter Squad? When it was just misadventures of the original trio trying to figure stuff out and when things tended to be more comedic? Don't get me wrong, the animation has vastly approved and credit where credit is due where the writing is concerned. I can certainly see why people would like this, but I personally prefered Starter Squad before things became more serious.
Charmander 😔
This was awesome! Worth the wait dude! Can't wait to see what you make next!
I find that ... symbolic that Squirtle evolved into WARtortle after what he witnessed... and that se somehow doesn’t want ChimiCHAR to end up like CHARmender.   Really great episode, I didn’t really expect such a big change.
Just… wow. After all these years.  I know that first sounded negative, but I’m just stunned. This was a very interesting turn of events. But what about the Mewtwo plot line? It made a little cameo here, but I just find it hard that Mewtwo would just let charmander die after what he had said. I honestly thought he may save charmander or something like that. Unless he can revive him, but it doesn’t seem like that’s the direction this is taking. Honestly this really surprised me and I’m excited to see how the story ends. Only two episodes left, and honestly I like the wait between episodes, truly makes each episode much more special, and almost makes it an event for me. I’ll wait patiently for the next one, no matter how many years it may take.
Congratulations on being on the trending list!
I miss Charmander :(
Squirtle is going to have the gods bring charmander and bulbasaur back to life!
Wtf. Aww
The last line from charmander in episode 9 song rock smasher was correct “Die” and now almost all the characters we knew died
R.I.P charmander 😔
Awesome
Episode on how charmander died?(edit) wait no i jus rewatched it
Thanks for making a video you finally made a video that was so long ago that you made a video
YES
Next episode: Squirtle - Zeus! i mean.... Arceus! your son have return!
Good ep hopefully this parasite won’t get much attention anymore. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=szMhNe4oc4k  Here’s to the remaining eps being scum clipper free.
fun fact UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE  Genocide be like:  20:02
The moment they came into contact with missingno, it distorted reality. His influence altered the timeline they were currently tracked on. Answer: Dialga, Palkia, and Arceus. As soon as I saw Turtwig and Chimchar on screen, I knew what Squirtle was doing. Really missed this series. Glad it's back.
When will the next episode be released
damn im really impressed by this episode. It was very emotional and in the next video I’m probably gonna guess squirtle/wartortle is gonna either fight arceus or mewtwo or celebi or one of the legendary Pokémon like dialga who can rewind time and space or turns out there’s nothing there and after they turn back time he saves charmander, chitchar and his relation with turtwig and bulbasaur and then they greet each other and they make a new team
My theory is that Squirtle is going to get Charmander‘s replacement  well As Charmander revived because why else would he bring the body
I wonder if that exchange with the caterpies at the entrance of the colony from the last episode were meant to foreshadow this one.
Snover sounds like the teacher from Rick and Morty
Don;t Worry. Palka and Dialga gonna fix everything what happend when Wartortle find then on Mt.Corronet
YOO THANK YOU FOR EPISODE 10 DUDE. AFTER SO LONG I DONT CARE THAT I HAD TO WAIT NOW FOR THIS EPISODE DUDE IT WAS AMAZING
Dang, He's level 99 now, by the time he levels up again he'll be evolving to Blastoise, can't wait!
LES GO
But did charmander have to die
This might be my favorite video on the internet
Oh oh oh my god
omg yayyy
Remember when we thought Charmander was the main character?
Oh my god it took so long
I am so glad there is more than gen 1 Pokémon
AMAZING GREAT JOB
Is there a reason you took forever to make e10, none the less this was awsome❤️❤️❤️❤️
Quite upset charamander died.
Welp, that was worth the wait, see y’all in 2 years
This was so sad and good. You did good man keep up the good work
It’s been so long
Yessssss
Yes Yes
I bet these 'gods' are just a bunch of random non-legendary cowards
Imagine the God of the mountain being celebi that returns back in time to the peace Era and saving charmander.  Or  Dialga, turning back in time and save charmander    Probably not but let a man dream
2 years huh, and charmander was my favorite too
Zhohoogobohogoohohohohohohohoohohohoh
You finally made a new one
Who came up with the title? Bulbasaur.
What does the Chinese or Japanese on Charmander's severed head say
charmander cant die. Hes my favourite...
This video: comes out Everyone:WOOOO YEAH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'M WAITING FOR!!
“Anarchy will prevail!”
been 2 years
OMG I was so stoked to see this. I was watching waiting in line at Sam's club XD. So sad Char died, but the spin on following Squirts traumatic past and evolving past it was beautiful 😍
Charmanders really dead :'(
I can’t believe the direction this series has taken! I never though watching the first episode like 8 years ago would turn into something this heart wrenching. The message with it is just so good!!!
Wartortle is level 99 confirmed. Level 100 blastoise?
not a fan of the move from comedy but happy for the return
I'm literally crying
OMG
HOW is this stupid talking Pokémon show the most emotionally engaging and morally mature thing I've ever watched?? "You chose to obey, stop shifting the blame" holy shit that speaks volumes to so many people. It's absolute genius.  Edit: PLEASE don't bring back charmander now though (using the gods or dialga or whatever) it was such a shock that you killed him off! Please don't nullify it now!
It’s crazy how this series started almost 9 years ago :o
Man, I noticed really early on how Squirtle was calling Chimpchar as just "Char", then later on when Turtwig was angry that Squirtle didn't even remember his name.. Really do be hitting different.
No one will every respect you!!! -Chimchar 2021
Dang Charmander actually died
One of the best episodes yet holy shit
YES!!!! YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!
Squirtle: If I'm gonna make bad choices, they're gonna be my own!  Snow: *S o   y o u   h a v e   c h o s e n   d e a t h?*   But the fact they actually put this reference in the episode was enough to make my fall out of my chair! XD
Anyone else kinda hoping the Nidoran or Squirtle to push the Capterpie from killing Charmander?
After 7 years
Oh my god its finally here
I almost forgot about this series and you left us on a great cliff hanger
22:58 WHAT THE FU-
It's back.........
Finally I loved the series and now it’s perfect 🤩
YES ITS FINALLY OUT YES
28 mins? That’s why it took 2 years
legend
So this whole story is about personal responsibility and freedom of choice.
Worth the wait so great really do appreciate the effort
I love the Snowvets.
*Return of the King*
This was awesome
😱😱😱 finally
OMG FINALLY I THOUGHT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
That moment you realize that Chimchar died the way he wanted to live. Alone.
This is sad but this part 20:31 is funny
I was hoping for charmander to get back to life and fight squirtel
Welp now ep 10 is here lets wait another 2 years
It’s been so long it’s finally here
when the world needed him the most...he returned
FINALLY AFTER SO LONG
HELL FUCKING YEAH!!!  And also Charmander no!!!!
Now wait 9 years for the next one
Finally
she fucking disowned Squirtle, if I was him I would've killed her and wore HER head as hat.
The kids: it's turtwing
OH MY GOD
Finally episode 10
GUYS ITS HAPPENING, EVERYONE CALM DOWN
It only took 1 year to make the final episode ( worth it )
20:35 Squirtle is a zombie to Caterpie because in the games, the more you train with your Pokémon, the better they follow your orders and fight for you. Which is why his facial expression changes when he is released.
3 years later
OMG CHARMANDER NOOOOOOOOO
Words cannot describe how blown away I am at the efforts made in this series! A simple Pokémon parody that turned into something so great! I'm embarrassed to admit, that I almost teared up lol. Bravo!!!
This is insanely good
The kids: who's that pokémon?
I cant believe this has number 6 on trending! Keep it up!
The wait was so worth it
(:
yes he has returned!
It's weird that they left us on a cliff hanger for 2 years and didn't continue the original story line and instead skipped time to where squitles trying to repeat that time line and flash backs
22:58 *top 10 last words*
Say sike rn
What started as a comical skit became something more.
This morning I was so happy to see episode 10 had finally came out but now that I've watched it I'm pretty upset because bulbasaur and charmander where my favourite characters and now there gone.
Squirtle becomes herobrime 😂😂
The legend has returned
finally
24:02  I really hope this isn’t going into cringey fedora tipping territory.
YES!!!!! OMG YES!!! THANK YOU!!!! WE ALL LOVE YOUR WORK!!!!
HOLY FUCK ITS HERE
That is like god of war kratos going to kill all the gods of Olympus
And then part 11 will be released in 2023
I want to hang out with those Snovers.
I am crying
Thank you for this.
If you dont make charmander come back then im going to unsubscribe
Totally worth the wait ❤
Oh, and for those curious. Caterpie's hat says 勝利 "Victory"
Finally!
Charmander
It it... Fanliy it came it
YES! FINALLY!!!!
For second i though this is not real..
What the hell starter squad just took the snow grave route and everything's fucked up
as soon as he said "something" I got an ad saying, "might have the new album?"
LETS GOOO EP 10!!!! finally:).
This was definitely worth the wait, i am really looking forward for the next chapter 😁
Now we wait for the next hmmm yeah, I will be waiting for that day.
ITS BEAN 5 YEARS
Oh. My. God... I didn't even know there was gonna be an episode 10 👍
I miss charmander :(  It's hard to see this series the same way without charmander
21:00 I don't get it  Does Caterpie mean he is afraid of evolving or am I missing something
I wonder what missingno is doing since it’s been 10 years even though we saw mewtwo fighting missingno in the background for tiny bit
25 min long one  wow
I've been waiting for so long and it's finally here. Thank god for this
Dang, this turned surprisingly dark, I loved it
getting legoshi vibes i also feel like charmander isn't actually dead...
Ten Years Later and Squirtle is now in Sinnoh There's a ten year difference between the release of Gen 1 and Gen 4. I see what you did there.
Im pumped! Epic stuff starter squad staff!
OMG finally
Squirtle's reason for refusing evolution is appreciably pragmatic, so much better than Pikachu's!  Hell it SHOULD have been Pikachu's reason not to evolve until a certain point.
Squirtle is an ass hole because he should get revenge for the death of Charmander
Charmander is reborn as charizard
OMG FINNAÑY
Now another 2 years until we get the next one
first evolution of the series, in what? 12 years?
I've noticed that the guy behind Rock Smasher voices Squirtle/ Wartortle. If he evolves into Blastoise, he'll sound just like a death metal vocalist.
Me episode 9 comes out: is 10 Me episode 10 comes out: has 5 children that had 2 children each witch each had 1 child
That is not fair killing charmarder
"I hate you both more then youll ever know"  That's the best quote ever
Absolutely phenomenal. The animation, the voice acting and direction, the shots ... It was such a treat! Thank you so much for this series. I'm loving Squirtle's role in this episode. Still the most reasonable one but held back by his inner demons.  Please, treat yourself with something nice, you truly deserve it!
Wow it's finally here great job
This was good 😱
YES
holy shit, the wait is finally over
That's some Samarai Jack vibes there
OH MY GOD ITS OUT
YOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOO IVE BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS!!!
That's my guy, show'em
I like how Squirtle was written as 98 specifically, so then once he hits 100 he would become blastoise
haven't finished the ep yet but i was genuinely shocked by the Charmander twist
Story line is so tight, congratz for finishing this episode
If you make another one I will subscribe
I have watched every single bit
Honestly didn’t think he gave up but figured that they couldn’t work on anymore or something, Thank you a lot for still working on thisbproject
Make another one I love this series
12:50  Anyone else saw that??
Come on make another one now cherry on top
Make another one please please please
Make another one
Make another one please
ITS HEREEEEEEE
felt like we were waiting for forever for the next episode and here it is and sky rocketed past my expectations
IT’S FINALLY HERE!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Make more
Starter Squad is basically Star Wars. Squirtle is Obi-Wan, trying to teach Charmander(Anakin) patience over journeys but Charmander turns to the dark side trying to evolve leading cracks and harming his potential, and falling from his arrogance. Squirtle then also falls to the dark side after being manipulated by Caterpie(Palpatine) yet has conflict and still has good in him, similar to Darth Vader
The starter Pokémon are cool I been waiting for this video
YES I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
Yes im snows
Well about dam time
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Squirle literally has ptsd from being forced to commit genocide.
holy shit... so like remember when this was a haha funny series... this shit got deep and i love it
he finally evolved....
HOLY SHIT THIS WAS SO GOOD
Hes back my dudes!
This was definitely worth the wait, great work!
Good episode
The oj is back
OH YEEEAAAHHHHH
this show is the reason that caterpie is my least favourite pokemon
Can you make a ep 11
Squirtle evolved!
OMG it's finally here!! :DDDD
Only true men of culture will recognize Snover's voice
The one thing i always associated this series with is that it never got finished and now that the new part is out it just feels weird
Wth charmander died why were so many episodes about him then.
That wait for this episode was meaningless
Holy cral wth I remember watching the whole serious like 6 MONTHS AGO
The fact of the gods and that they were sinnoh starters makes me think hes going to get dialga to travel back in time and save his friends.
I low key don't like it any more
the first scene, chimchar reminds me of a certain pig
THAT WAS EPIC
HOLY SH*T ITS HERE
I’m just speechless with what just happened this episode
Trending 👑
RIP Chimchar
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
So is charmander dead
Bro I’m gonna cry it was worth waiting ;)
When the world needed him most he came back
Hell yea I’ll only be 50 when this ends 3 episodes later
Thank you so much for this amazing series! I can't imagine how much hard work it takes to put all of this together. This one was the best episode yet, and the visual quality really has been climbing. Squirtle's character arc was awesome and I love how it takes Charmander's early deconstruction of Pokemon society and really propels it to the next level. Excellent work as always!!
I really want a way that Charmander comes back to life some how because Charmander was my favorite character in this amazing series!
The return is here
we have waited for so long and now its time to wait another 4 years for the next one
ITS BAAAAAAAAAACK!!
Man this was so good! I loved every second off it!!! I can't wait for the next episode.
Now why does Blue Shell Man Guy give me Asura's Wrath Vibes..?
This was flipping awesome!
YESSSS ITS FINALLY HERE we all know it was worth the wait thanks for taking your time to make something so sick:)))))))))))
Wartortle don't go up there, the Bittercold is even more ruthless than the Abomasnow.
I loved Charmander
This was worth waiting for it's also lot more smoother
this was truly amazin *claps
Don’t worry next episode wartotle will probably explain to char why he is like we gotta stick together and reveal how charmander died and resolve this series probably
Long I have waited
Sucks that charmander died
Finallllllyy i love this series keep up the great work
That snover is iconic, I love him
Finally after ages the legend has finally made it
I WAITED 12345645654 YEARS JUST TO SEE THIS?!!?!?!?!?!? I WANT MOREEE MORE MOREMRORE MOREE                     jk this is actually really good!!!!!
Loved the episode!
Are you going to to episode 11 today
12:47 0.5 speed
Dang I can’t believe charmander died also mewtwo fighting missingno in the background was pretty cool 12:50
Their a new two fighting the gicht
Theirs anew two
My least favorite out of the three is Charmander but to hear that Charmander died in this series really hurt me I don't know why though
wow ep 10 was amazing... cant wait to wait another 3-4 years worth of tears and waiting for ep 11
Glad I Saw this in recommended I forgot I was waiting for this it’s been so long
This is nice. Maybe more year episode will release lol XD
12:50 Hi Mewtwo
Wow, didn't expect Charmander to actually die! Squirtle's journey just hits raw seeing what he went through, being so thoroughly broken down by that Caterpie and the revelation that he was so completely broken that they pitied whoever got ahold of him next. But yeah, I didn't expect a ten year timeskip. Up until the end I thought it was all gonna be a dream or all taking place in Squritle's mind in the seconds before he tried to save Charmander.  Is the plot with MissingNo gonna get resolved at some point? I hope so.
wack, fuck you guys for killing the best character the show had going for it. Of course I'm talking about charmander.
Just realized Squirtle was holding an everstone
I had actually forgotten about these
ITS HERE!!
so 2 more years for ep.11?
holy- dude this episode was actually dark
There is no way
E
LETS GOOOOOO ITS HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Well it took you guys a while but my patience was rewarded! Great episode! Loved it. I look forward to your next episode. Thank you! Keep up the good work. 👍
Squirtle has pretty much become Charmander in this episode.
So now Squirtle is a Level 99 Newly Evolved Wartortle… These last 2 episodes are gonna be amazing, and I can already tell it. Excited for more!!!
let's go
I hope that Charmander will be resuscitated
I can’t believe charmander died! He was the best
so when ep 11 12 and 13 releasing  would be nice if there were 40 minutes each and contained as much content as the previous episodes
Pls don’t say it’s over I watched ‘‘tis when I was 6 and know I’m 10
wow.
I hope part 11 comes quickly
So as of now, Wartortle is now lv. 99. He has only one level left to get to Blastoise.
Rest in peace Charmander
WARtortle!
It’s actually back I’ve been waiting
Sheltos, God of War....ter.
Been watching these since Ep1 and I love to see how it has grown into a legit series. I love this! 🔥
YOKATAASAAAAAAAA
I gotta say this wasn't the way i thought this was going. Its a very welcomed surprise and worth the wait. Keep up the good work man.
charmander was my favorite character. i miss him
HES FOCKIN BACK!!!!
This reminds me of Gundam IBO season 2.
YESSS
I was laughing so hard at fearow!
Really? Really? did you kill charmander? Te mamaste
Omg finally
I love this series such great animation, was really excited that a new video came out. Thanks for the great content as always.
It is sad everyone is dying except turtwig  and bulbasaur
first RIP Charmander 2013-2019 (its not 2021 because for 2021 is just the back story) is it just me who wants to just cry after hearing “wait charmander actually died” i watched this series when it came out in my childhood (ofc not in this acc) but its so painful beacuse all of us probably wishes charmander was alive and everyone got to evolve just like they wanted to and work as a team and have a happy ending
That poor Fearow..
It’s sad charmader died
I am really disappointed! I want Bulbasaur and Charmander!!! 🤧😭
What an incredible episode Shipp! The adventure, the drama, and the comedy! Truly a masterpiece!
No… it’s can’t end like that!…  I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT,
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
When is episode 11 coming out?
Finally! 😍
Let's goooooooo I have waited so long like two years thanks I am blessed with another video
I love this
I am ready for another 3 years before uploading
My biggest question is…did charmander truly perish?
Yes I have waited so long
Starter squad is back!!
Damnit... Everyone we knew for 9 episodes (8 years!!!) are now gone except for Squirtle. 😱 That's strange, but let's see what's happening next! I hope we learn about what happened to ghosts, Hitmonchan and Mewtwo, there're only 2 episodes left ☹️  P.S Did someone understand what happened to Bulbasaur?
It's Turtwig Squirtle
I stopped watching when I realized charmander  died.
It is sad  squirtle  flashback is about they are doing war and dying  it is sad
Who saw the mewtwo-
Imagine how different this would of been if red never went in that DAMN STARTER PLACE.
Where can I read the manga?
Part 11 pls
I bet that Episode 11 will be a flashback episode that show how Squirtle met Chimchar and Turtwig and Episode 12 will show Wartortle meeting with the Pokémon gods.
I was in elementary school when the series started, now I’m half way done with high school and the series still isn’t over 😂
Beautiful
Finally
I have no doubt that Wartortle will meet Dialga and palkia in the next episode.
Finnaly episode 10 yaya
He should have been blastoise
The snovers remind me of Mr. Meseeks
The only thing this needed was the Title to be called Legend of Blue Shell Turtle Man Guy
Maybe Mewtwo is the Pokémon god Wartortle will talk to next. I hope Turtwig comes back too.
no fucking way charmander and bulbusaur died that completely ruins the entire series after all that there fucking dead! BS!!!
Yo everyone share this rn,this man deserves this comeback clout.
Bro this was amazing, fuckin love the credits music too.
Now we wait another year or two for the next episode see y'all then
100% worth the wait! Fucking epic.
OMG FINALLY!!!!!!!!
Rest in peace Charmander he was just misunderstood😢😢❤️
Someone can send me the link too the ending song please :) ?
it something to say that anime has taught me that unless you see the death then i dont believe it and even then it doesn't even mean that they will stay dead
Loved it
THIS IS AMAZING
Can’t wait for next years episode. Arceus, mewtwo, rayquaza, hell it can be mew just chilling on the mountain top saying hey
What an amazing episode. The plot has finally expanded to something interesting!
WHY CANT CHARMANDER HAVE LIVED WHYYYYYYYY
Finally it's out
Damn He- he strong
Now level 99, and on his way to fight god...  OR BECOME HIM
Oh, heck yess wow ....   this was worth the wait .... and it will be worth waiting again ....  :)
I was just here for charmander
Wow, just wow. I can't even began to describe what I was witnessed. With your tweets for the last couple days, I already had a feeling that Charmander was actually dead, and my suspicions were correct. Honestly, all of those flashbacks where we see things falling apart with the caterpies, and Squirtle just being empty of all emotions, is just so depressing. Not to mention that we never see Bulbasaur's fate is just, ...I can't even finish that sentence. And now Squirtle is trying to rebuild the team that he once had. This is the most heartbreaking episode, yet!
The Legend of Blue Shell Man Guy was an amazing one and after 2 years of waiting, speculating, and hoping this episode finally came out I can't wait for the next one
The wait was well indeed worth it
Everyones talking about Charmanders death, but no ones talking about where Bulbasaur is...
Can't wait till I'm in college and get episode 11
FINALLY
CHARMANDER ACTUALLY DIED?! WTH?!
YES!!
I squirtle makes it to the top, maybe he can bring charmander or char back... if not maybe he will meet the ghastly that charmander possibly turned into
The snorunts are awesome
how could you really charmander let die!? i want the original squad!🤧😭
omg is finally here I been waiting for loooooooooooong time
It's finally here guys
Woah, that was totally epic. I cant wait until part 11 comes out in 2025!           jokes aside this is epic and totally worth the wait, keep up the good work shipp
R.I.P Charmander
FINALLy
Heeeeeeeeenen?
OMG, Episode got released!
Not surprised that Charmander is dead, I'm more surprised that Bulbasaur is gone too. Also feeling cerebus syndrome watching this though.
I feel like were going to go back in time kinda of like endgame where wartortle will stop the war from happening
OMG HES ALIVE
Yes! We finally got a new episode!
Now I have to wait another 4 years
we waited and you delivered, beautifully
the wait was damn worth it
Seriously that's it how can the story of the Kanto starters end like that
8 years from de first espisode, this is so awesome
Outstanding work as always you never cease to amaze us man
BRUH
Bruh I want charmander back
I wanted there to be Charmander and bulbersure
Squirtle: Evolves, gonna say something to God, elaborates no further
See y’all next year
We neeeed more
The Mystery Dungeon Series in a Nutshell video is lit ngl
How long has it been years or decades?
Been waiting so long for this thank God it's out I am hyped!
Burning Owl Society is Disney cutting The Owl House short :(
This was awesome! See y'all in 3 years.
SO MANY YEAR'S AND IT'S FINALLY HERE :OO
Loved it. I get the feeling Squirtle didn't want to evolve because he was hanging onto the past and a sense of helplessness. It's when he decided to take charge, accept the present, and take accountability that he decided to finally evolve. Can't wait til next episode!
CHARMANDER, NO!!!!
Okay, I'm about to risk being everybody's worst enemy for leaving this comment, but I honestly want to treat this as an open discussion. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Shipp and the things he creates, and every word of what you're about to read comes from a place of love and compassion. I'm not looking to change hearts and minds here. I only intend to articulate my perspective coming out of this for the first time, and I appreciate anyone who wishes to give it a read.  There's an interesting dynamic presented when you kill off your only active protagonist, as the whole story is gonna stop dead in it's tracks until your passive protagonist(s) physically can't stay passive anymore. Following Charmander's death, there was only ever one way this narrative could possibly play out. Squirtle and Bulbasaur lose Charmander, the only person that _forced_ them into action, they become complacent, stagnating in their prison indefinitely, Caterpie's poor leadership runs the whole forest into the ground, and the whole prison crumbles around them until there's literally no other choice left _but_ to leave. This chain of events is effectively unavoidable given the plot threads that led us here.  I find it disappointing then, not that this is where we took things, but that this episode lays all of this out and has nothing else to say for itself. As a self-contained episode, Charmander's death plays more like empty shock value than anything thought provoking, which is really unfortunate because I don't think it's intentional. We spend more time flaunting his corpse as a trophy than we spend experiencing how his friends were personally impacted by watching their friend die. The most we get to see is what his absence meant for Squirtle's freedom, the trauma it indirectly subjected him to in becoming a mindless soldier, and his attempts to fill the void with replacement friends played for laughs. Maybe some cards were being deliberately played close to the chest, but as a self-contained experience, the way this sequence of events was handled felt a bit shallow to me.  The grand revelation we end with is the passive protagonist determining they must learn to be more active, but the 10 year time jump kind of already spells out for us that this is a problem Squirtle needs to overcome. This effectively results in an episode that feels nonproductive as it's narrative doesn't grow or evolve over time. It just sort of keeps restating the narrative by showing the problem over and over until Squirtle finally figures it out. But that's ultimately the big takeaway from the episode, and I found it's lack of exploration a bit disappointing.  Killing off Charmander is a huge narrative risk, given that so many rudiments of the show were centered around how his actions impacted the people around him, and while I recognize the desire to depict the harshness of reality, where sometimes people's stories just end abruptly, Charmander's death took a lot of the narrative progression with him, and I don't think this episode offered enough substance to make up for the plot threads Charmander once juggled. I can only hope this episode was simply meant to act as a stepping stone to get to the parts of this story Shipp's _actually_ excited to tell, but knowing how much love, dedication, and time Shipp puts into these episodes, it's fair to say we won't be getting any answers for a good while, so I'm bummed like crazy I didn't love everything I saw today.
Ep 11
YES FINALLY
Rip charmander
I can't belive charmander died he's the one who helped him evolve and live
He did it…
FINALYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYU
RIP Charmander, pretty weird that you can stand a terrible beating from Geodude but die from a splinter and Goddamn Squirtle.
ITS OUT OMG
I feel bad for the fearow
#6 on trending
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES IVE WAITED SOOOO LONG FOR THIS
How long have i waiat can Somebody Answer
22:05 Bro went from:  🐢 to 🦖 "MOVE"!
I never put comments in youtube videos.... but this man....I am so grateful for making me relive my childhood nostalgia of pokemon with this series and I am also extremely proud of you to see from the start of the starter squad till this. Love the animations and waiting eagerly on the next episode.
Episode 11 is probably gonna be the last, but given MissingNo.‘s presence in the story, I wanna see the UBs be dragged in as well.
“WHAT DA FU-“
What about mewtwo and missingno
prediction: wartortle is gonna revive charmander with the help of a pokegod in exchange for something, maybe his levels
Now to wait for two more years for episode 11! Anyways, I love it ❤️
you made that water gun ability appear as a real gun, that's awesome
O.o
I'm hoping Dialga is on top of that mountain so Warturtle can go back in time and make his own choice. Also Mewtwo still struggling with Missingno.
were gonna wait another year
I really like turtwig, i hope he comes back
Where tha next episode at??
this is by far the worst episode in the series
Literally JUST watched the entire series the other day and just in time too!
Well, see you all in 2023
Guess we’re waiting another year
Man what a great episode. I hope we don’t have to wait to long for the next! 👍
That was great!
good job
8:10 this line dialga send wartortle back in time to do things differently
Charmander still dead but he's coming back  "EVENTUALLY"
FINNALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR LIKE A YEAR
When Brilliant Diamond is released I'll choose Chimchar so he doesn't climb up a mountain and die.
woooo
Whisker’s death hits me harder then charmander’s. She was so nice....  Great work, way too good for YouTube’s standards
FINALLY
Absolutely worth the wait. It really changes the feel of the last 9 episodes to know that everything didn't turn out okay in the end. When the main character doesnt get an ex  machina there are serious stakes and consequences.
more more more
2 years later, I forgot this series even existed until now...
:o
I kinda have a feeling that charmander is gonna come back but not sure, I really hope he comes back
I am fully prepared to wait 2 more years.
See y'all in ten years.
HOLY SHIT! HE UPLOADED! FINALLY LETS GO
well i'll se ya all in two years
I liked charmander
we're starting with goku
Please  bring charmed  I mes him he is sooooo coooooool

Abomasnow: I AM AN EMISSARY OF THE GODS. Wartortle: Well unfortunately for you... I am a God of WAR...tortle
Nooooo Charmander😭
Just another 5 years for the next episode 🔥🔥🔥
Time for wait another year for ep 11
So... he's coming back in time, not what i expected but i like it
You went a strange direction with this, but I like it though 👍
Episode 1-7 : 😂 Episode 8-9 : 😨 Episode 10 : :,)
Well it’s time to wait another 2 years for the next episode
Did no one notice that mewtwo is right there in 12:51?
Squirtle has gone through to much these past episodes. He has seen 2 friends died and he fought in the war.
I graduated high school in the time it took for this to come out. Was worth the wait, this was awesome.
I better wake up to this being number 1 on trending
Man I miss Charmander and bulbasaur
🤔 Am I supposed to like Squirtle or outright hate him?
Nooo fuck, I haven’t had my tv on WiFi for a while so i downloaded the starter squad movie thing you guys made for my baby, who knew my baby was vibing with you guys influencing you to make more. The last update you guys made that I witnessed was right after my daughter was getting hyped for this content. I hope the best for you guys cuz my daughter loves this shit.
please bring back charmander
Now we wait for another year to get the next one
This is about the flashbacks or something
very cool
Oh wow this made it on trending
Finally I have been checking everyday
Cant wait for part 11
I have been waiting for 2 years
Whiskers dead?! Nooooo ;-;)
Great episode, sucks what happened to charmander, great story telling on what happened to charmander. But fuck squirtle he’s a literal piece of shit. Learned his lesson WAYYYYYY too late.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Almost 1-2 years since the last episode. It finally came out!
This was worth the wait
Pokemon Gurren Laggan seems like an awesome idea ngl
Like this diffrent episode,but please.......MAKE THEM FASTER IF POSSIBLE
YESSSS AND ITS 28 mins
OH MY GOD ITS HERE
Finally we finally see the ep 10 we dont need to wait now we can enjoy
i dont like thes  anymor you need  charmander
Bruh I CANT BELIEVE Charmander died , LIKE WHAT ??!??? And bro squrtle wtf is wrong with u WHY DIDNT U SAVE HIM ????? Why, now this will haunt u for the rest of your life u stupid turtlekekdjhd idk what I am saying I am out OF FUCKING words I got too attached to the characters and now I am just like : what now? Also I don't get why did squrtle turn into a slave machine and why didn't he want to evolve??
I have been waiting for years
Prediction time!: Next episode will have our bubble water starter meet with these legendary pokemon and theres ganna be a whole thing about him wanting to undo what has been done, time travel shinanigans ensu, at the end of the episode and he then saves charmander and Charmander changes his ways and in the final episode we get to see them all evolved!
Wheres charmender
You guys have no idea how happy I am that you posted. I legit freaked out and it was just insane. This was a huge part of my childhood and I am so glad that after 8 years this entire series might come to an epic and outstanding end. Great job you guys. (Only 2 episodes left!)
Charmander had it coming
ITS HAPPENING BOYS, THE EPISODE 10 IS OUT
Wow, it's finally here, and it only took what like 2 years, almost the same exact time that Nintendo takes to release a big game that's actually good.
NOOOO FUCKING WAY I WAITED 2 YEARS EPISODE 1 CAME OUT 8 YEARS AGO I WAS 15 BACK THEN
i think you should stick to slowpoke speed
I'm curious of whatever happened to bulbvasuar, maybe he'll return as a venasaur. Maybe turtwig will find himself alone and discovers Venasaur who tells him wisdom about friendship or something and turtwig goes back to help wartortle
This is exactly I've been waiting for. Charmander dies never evolved, Bulbasaur left off the team, and squirtle will find the way to fix this and end this war quickly. To find out what is going to happen, this time for another action adventure. As the journey begins to the war continues. (To be continued...)
Finally ive waited so long
Man this was such a interesting direction to take the story. I was not expecting for charmander to actually die, but I think it was a good decision, i'm itching to know what happens next. Good job dude for all the work you've done over the years, you've earned it twice over!
12:51 For people realizing the comments about Missingno appearance
Please release ep 11 very soon I just can't wait for another ep
We, Need, More.
FINALLY AFTER A MILLION YEARS :D
See y’all again for another amazing episode in 2023
Wow my childhood has returned just got to wait another year for it to do so again.  :)              Wait I’m still a child .       Probably should be rephrased to this part of my childhood.   Yup.
Amongst all this depression, flashbacks and cool character moments ... an opportunity was missed to have Turtwig's name in the credits as "Stickle".
finally
I WANT CHARMANDER BACK😭😭😭
10 hours late :>
HOLY ****!!!! STARTER SQUAD IS ACTUALLY BACK!!!!!
I don’t wanna wait another two years
This is a good job. Can't wait for the next episode!
Damn…. I’m sad that Charmander actually died…..
Now I can see why this took along time
The wait may now be over. But the next wait has just begun. We will need to wait two more times for two more episodes. But anyway, I liked this episode!
Chhhhhhhhhhh
Can we appreciate how River Vitae can make a flawless Michael McConnohie impression?
Legends Arceus's boss pokemon encounters looking NICE
This is insane and sad and unbelievable and stupid
Awwww charmander dead.. 😔
Let’s go!
finallyyy a new episode
Charmander really died
2 years later
Shippidge was right, this WAS a different kind of episode, or something along those lines before he changed what he originally said in the trailer...  /8
Omg you finally updated it i think you will post it after 10000 years
Finally it’s out
Yesssss
Shippidge you absolute legend
22:00 "Then you have chosen DEATH"
Squirtle is Kratos lol
No Charmander is Dead
that BIRD!!! was so cute!
WONDERFUL EPISODE, LOVED SO MUCH, DON'T STOP
I love how everyone expected Charmander to live but then in the middle of the video Squirtle is like “Yeah Charmander died”
I accidentally clicked this video and the first thing I hear is you’re not getting away with this
7:55 Dang i miss Charmander
FINALLYYYYYY!!!!!!
Time to wait another 3 years 😔
Finally the content creator who is actually a slowpoke and forget to use x speed make the next video after 2 years
6:23
6323
Ah yeah it's all coming together.
Squirtle looks like a single father of 10 kids
Oh, the smile on my face after seeing this! In today's era of fast fading trends, the fact that everyone here is just as excited about the new episode even after these long breaks shows how awesome the work you're doing is. See ya guys in 2023 I guess!
The main character swapped between charmander to squirtle.
Bet anyone anything its gonna be hyped up to be arceus and its gonna be bidoof
All these years and it’s finally here 🥲
We don't like chimchar.
OMG finally
what
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah finally!!!!!!!
Amazing, only 2 left :D and a crap ton of waiting, sad we didnt get another sick song like last time
La espera fue larga,  pero Valio la maldita pena
#8 on trending that’s awesome.
He is still animating (do you use blender and do you model your own models) squirt,e got a power up oh my god
yes finally I love this it's so sad how the charmander died tho maybe I could be a different charmander and the real one is still alive cause in the 3 episodes left video charmander was there after it happened with bulbasaur but squirrel wasn't so I think at the end of the series squirtle  dies.:( anyway well done I love the bit where squirtle said bulbasaur liked where he was. lol at least the caterpie had a good snack before the war.
HEAVEN HAS ARIVVED
This is by far the most gorgeous episode yet by far! And also the darkest one yet, lord I did not expect that time skip and confirmed death!
No one truly got it..... all charmamder wanted was to be by squirtle's side again. 😔
Every ten years he comes back
I hope Palkia at least sounds like a girl and Giratina. Also Turtwig is a tortoise. If anything Dialga will send him back in time to prevent Charmander’s death.
Warturtle more like GODturtle then GODtoise
Nobody's talking about how neither Piplup nor Lucario weren't featured
Thank you shippiddge for this Video I've been patiently waiting and it was worth the wait I hope you notice this I'll be seeing you on the next episode or trailers goodbye for now and I hope you get 1 million subs
He has become God of War(tortle) :P
This was truly amazing but I was kinda upset that charamender (can't spell) died I wanted to see him evolve and be hella strong than make him die a god
Let’s go
glad to see mewtwo is still out there fighting the good fight
Plz plz plz, i fell in love with turtwig in like 5 mins, i want him to return
Is it just me or do I miss charmander
Never in the dawn of light would I think to live the day of episode 10
RIP charmander.
no way its backkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I miss charmander and bubasor
I was waiting very long time for next episode. THIS. IS. REALY. GOOD WORK. And i guess almost everyone would agrre with me
2 left i think
See you next year 😢
The legend is back 🤩
YES THX AFTER 2 YEARS but the beginning was shoking ten years later wow 👏 but this is good can't wait for ep 11 in like a year
The gods will semd him back amd carmander will be alive
OMMMFFGGGG YESS FINALLY ITS OUT
Now when is 11 and 12
Who of the poke tuber and non poke tubers are going to react to this
OH MA GOD IS FINALLY OUT
That is not the end right
IS FINALLY OUT
Will Wartotle have children?
cant wait for episode 11
The legend has returned
Dialga is definitely at the top, or Arceus. Hoping for Dialga, time travel to the past Wartortle! Undo the war and deaths of the past 10 years!
Ironically Wartortle reminds me of Raphael voice wise.  Also Knuckles but he’s not a fellow turtle so…
Sin duda alguna uno de los mejores capítulos en toda la serie. Espero con ancias el siguiente!!!!!.
Wow can't believe it's been long since last time
Without Charmander 😭 With that said cannot wait for rest.. 🤣
Please don’t take so long next time.
Omg i knew the wait would be worth it. Already ready for another wait 😘
the power you have after evolving is emence cant wait for episode 11 hopefully not in 2 years
Charmander is gone :(
The coward turned in to a god
When episode 11 come out
I really thought that ep 9 was the end…
This Wartortle is so strong!
Finally!!!!!!!! After years of waiting we finally got it
SPOILER, for those who haven't watched til the end       I'm assuming Wartortle is going to the Gods to revive Chimchar (Char).
"The mercy of the gods is wasted on the disobedient."   That was a good line.
FINALLY!
I seriously really thought I’d be married with kids by the time this video would be released
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FINALLY
This is amazing I can’t wait for a next year or two to see what happeneds next😁
Caterpie finally understands that’s she’s doing something wrong. I’m satisfied.
Me: liked the video before watching it
Wow, just wow 10/10
It’s been 3 years I think and it Le out FINALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ITS OUT
WTFFFF
Fan: he's gotta live, he's like, the main character! Ship: so yeah he dies Fans: *what?*
Episode 11 i wonder when it comes out probably a while
Starter squad episode 11 in 2022 or (maybe 2023)
Wow! I can't wait for the next episode in... 2023.
The King Is Back In His Throne
Squirtle I'm kind of disappointed to you
WAIT THIS IS FINALLY HERE?!?!
I’ve been waiting for so long
HOLY SHIt ITS HERe FINALLY IM SO HYPED TO WATCH I PAUSED IT RN
What if Nintendo made a God of War  (2018) esque game, where you pick a starter and play as that starter following some adventure about going through towns, recruiting pokemon, and fighting some war against some outside groups of pokemon.
It's a shame that charmander didn't get to evolve that's all he wanted to be strong
Rip beaver society
If the time travel theories are true, would it make more sense for Celebi or Dialga (or Rotom I guess) to be the God at the mountaintop instead of Arceus?
You came outta fucking no where, welcome back!
Finally a new episode
Yay this was great can't wait for the next
This episode was amazing but I swear if it takes another two years for episode 11 I’m going to shoot somebody
If he’s this strong as a squirrel turtle. Imagine how overpowered he’s gonna be as a tank turtle
Me: YES YES YESSSSSS
8 on trending let's get to number one
the series is gonna be boring if charmander and bulbasaur arent in it
Can we have ep.11 please
Yes it been 4 or 3 years
finish watching this you would be thinking of episode 11 already
It’s all coming together
Ep was great see you next year
Charmander is a bulbasaur before he died had children? like they could have found equals of their female species to have had children and left them with their mothers?
Please don't tell me charmander's dead please please
Nah that's not true is charmander really dead bro whyyyy 😔😔😔😔🤧😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i really liked charmander
I love it!!
Finally (:
10 years later
I miss Bulbasuar But I love what you did the this keep it going plaese!
Bet you were gonna say hat huh 20:08
it's so sad  that Squirtle has been thru alot and so depressing and exciting  😳
:(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
What are the odds that i just happen to look this up the day it dropped lmao
lezzgo
Shippiddge is a good maker
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
sucks that Charmander is gone, but this episode was fire
HE IS BACK BABY
I think episode 9 should have an alternative ending. Who thinks the same?
considering ep 1 came out 8 yrs ago (been watching since day 1) and everything in ep 1-9 happens around the same time span. would that mean with the 10 yr timeskip happens, we expect the series to end in the next 2 yrs??
My question is what going on with Mew Two Fighting the Glitch Pokemon?  Will the Hitmochan and Haunter and be forever fused to the the Glitch Pokemon?
YES
I started watching the series in about year 2, so I would've been about 8 or 9, I'm 14 turning 15 now and I'll probably be in Uni by the time the final episode has come out, I would have literally grew up with this series
the trees are amazing lool. i have been here since ep1. i am not sure about the time skip yet but the flash back are good. but i love the original squad and was soo invested i hope that it fleshes it out
Well may rest in peace Charmander
YO
YOOOO CHARMANDER DIED!!! OMGGG
I'm gonna miss Whiskers
But u left it in a cliffhanger
Dynamax abomasnow?
Bro finnaly thanks alot!!
Time to wait another 2 years
I like how the snover sounds like a voice from school house rock
I had the concept of Pokémon gods since Pokémon Go came out as Giovanni arrogantly tried to capture them with technology and which ended Team Rocket until a mystery villain revived it so great to see it be used here.   Love it as always and going to share.
he is back
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONGGGGG
So when is the next 1 coming out
TODAY!!! IS THE BEST DAY
YEEEEEEES IT WAS WORTH IT
BROOOOOOOOooooo
It was a legend but finally it has become true episode 10
I found a mistake which was funny when squirtle and snover jump across the rock the another snover starts T posing
Well..  that was heavy,   And absolutely awesome!
You guys still alive? 🤣🤣
Yay it came out
This might be a dumb idea, but I think that Red I at the top of the mountain
OMFG FINALLYYYYY
This is such a great episode, the only downside is that we need to wait ages for another episode to release, but it's worth it if you continue to put out masterpieces. This was amazing, I cant wait for the next episodes
I thought that seeing Charmander die would make me feel anything...but I just dont care, he was a douchebag and a kind of a bad friend, and now we saw another fire type pokemon with a bad personality acting like he is high and mighty but his arrogance killed him, should I feel bad? Pity XD hmmm still though he might still be alive.  Also damn Poor Squirtle has PTSD, I feel real bad for the dude, where is this even going? The plot in this episode was really awesome, makes me feel like its a movie or some psp 3 game, its Squirtle time.
Fastest half-hour of my life. But that's what happens when one is fully invested and fully entertained.
It's here. 2 years later.
episode 10 is finally out!
The animation and graphics have gotten so much better wow
Welp, time to wait another 2 years for the next episode.
the voice acting, specially for abomasnow was stellar, absolutely memorable performance for times to come
Huh, Thought Squirtle Would've Disobeyed Caterpie & Save Charmander, But He Didn't.  He Didn't Because He Followed "The Rules" And "Listen To Their Trainer" And That's The Part Of Him That Refused To Evolved After All This Time, Until Near The End Of This Video.  BTW, This Episode Was Worth The Wait (A Whole 2 Years For Us And A Decade For Squirtle) And This Gets An Unusual Rating Of *9.6/10* For All This, And It Hasn't Finished Yet And Knowing What's Up There, We Can Only Guess At This Point On What Happens And I Have A Few Theories Of My Own Already.
Arceus could help bring Charmander back right?
Im kinda confused, why was there a war and what happened to missingno
R.I.P Charmander
I don’t like the fact that 9 eps where based on season 1
WE NEED SQUIRTLE USING A MAX REVIVE ON CHAMANDER NOW!
Don't offend but I thought you might be died
Where's Piplup? Chimchar and Turtwig are in this episode.
I'm guessing he'll find charmander up there
12:51 Hi Mewtwo and Missingo😦
It took you 2 years to upload just eps 10 jt Will proplay be 3 yars for you to make eps 11
I believe R. Lee Ermy said it first, so if I may quote him: "OUT FUCKING STANDING!"
Wtf did I miss an episode? I thought the last one was when charmander was fighting geode
Wow I’ve been trying to share this series for a while I can’t believe I found episode 10
When I was hoping this i was hoping it was what sqirtle saw and sacrificed himself for charmander to live
Let's get this to number 1 on trending
Finally ep 10 of starter squad I been waiting for too long now thank you for the great episode man i'am happy thanks bro
Can't wait for ep 11 if there is one take your time in making it no rush here
Finally no more waiting damn
uncle?
OMG FINALLY EPISODE 10 LESS GOOOOOO
So when's episode 11?
on now only 2-3 more years until the next one! (which I will be eagerly awaiting). Also poor squirtle has PTSD :(
(Spoilers) There's layers to Squirtle's being broken in the flashback. When Caterpie triggered his rage in the first flashback, Squirtle looks at him and denied his evolution as he calmed down. He wasn't looking at Caterpie; he was looking at the severed head of Charmander worn as a hat. It reminded him his lashing out costed his friend's life, and his fear of losing control and taking responsibility finally broke him into a mindless slave. This is the best episode by far in showing drastic character growth (or regression)!  My current theory of the next episode would be Bluey dueling Arceus to rewind time and preventing Charmander's death, and the finale could be the squad handling the Missingno situation.
Can't wait for the next episode!
I really like that snowy coconut guy.
Finnaly
We need more Snover
ITS BACK
can't wait for ep 11
98?!
Well he's got one more level he can go full blastoise yet
It's finally  here  And it was spectacular amazing job😄😁
This has been one of the most epic things I have seen. The storytelling, the actions, Squirtle's reflection on everything. My God was this good.  I had a feeling Charmander died and Bulbasaur wanted this life but this hits so many levels
Wait where is the other to are they dead
Ep:11 please
I waited 2 years for this...im beyond disappointed. WHY WOULD YOU KILL CHARMANDER
WAIT CHARMANDER IS DEAD
Wait no- NO! DONT END- DONT END DONT END DONT- I CANT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR-…. *episode ends NOOOoOoOOOOoooo
Dude did charmander hold you hostage until you made this video?
I was just wondering about the other generations of Pokémon getting included and was hoping for a Johto spin-off.   Also be neat if the anime’s version of Meowth showed up without Team Rocket.
Sheeeeeesh
Finally
i dont know how but, i wanted to see starter squad again and IN THE SAME DAY i re-see it the episode 10 lauches, nice
I'M HERE FOR IT!!! I'M HERE FOR ALL OF IT!!!
finally ive been here since ep 2
mewtwo facing off against missingno in the background. Nice.
Squirtle just turned into kratos. That’s bad
That was a great episode. Now we just have to wait another year for the next one...
Why??? Charmander was the best----
I can't believe you got Dee Reynolds from its always sunny to do a cameo!
FUCKING FINALLY
EP.10 FINALLY!!
The Story continues next time on Start Squad Z
Holy cow I am blown away by this new twist! Y'all did so well and it was worth the wait every time!
Wow this was a great episode I understand why it took so long. It was 24 minutes long and and extra 4 for the credits. I loved how squirtle evolved but I dislike the new voice but it would make sense. Overall thank you so much for taking your time and effort with your team to make this. I hope you guys get a good rest.
Commented on Patreon but adding another for the algo lol. Amazing video Pierce. Loved how you left Squirtle at level 98 for the potential of him to evolve twice. Disturbed by the Charmander hat but it definitely made sense.
A moment of silence for our boy Charmander 😔
Wow the way was long but I can believe it Thanks for doing this
BRO ITS FINNALY OUTT
Only took 2 years
It’s like 507th century
You shouldn't have killed my boy Charmander... I liked the video because this series is a masterpiece, but my heart is broken.
#8 on trending. My god the hype
WHO ELSE FORGOT ABOUT THIS SERIES
I definitely didn't expect charmander to die! O.o but I absolutely loved this episode! Can't wait to see Wartortle evolve into the powerful Blastoise he deserves!
He's level 98, wears the everstone for access to moves from lower levels, has 2 evolution stages. Lmao.
FINALLY EP 10
Hype
this episode is a massive let down
I swear if there is gonna be a dues ex machina and charmander is actually somehow still alive im going to die
Maybe his going to ask to restart his life just at where they were being chosen
I'm glad this project wasn't dropped and you've been still grinding it since the first one dropped. Amazing work as always
This is my third or fourth time watching this
All i can say is that the waiting was worth it
Finally, after all these years, WE HAVE #10!!!!
I… need… the new one . But wtf happened with mew 2 ??? Didn’t he ask them to met him in the cave
THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED LMAOOOO
How long  whas it am 99 years old
Did Squirtles' lv. 98 balls just drop?
So when is episode 11 coming out most likely
what happened to charmander and bulbasuar??
I was thinking that after charmindar die squrtle will kill everyone
Omg poggers
Why do the episodes get so much longer?
Omg finnaly
TWO more episodes after this. I'm legitimately wondering what's going on now.  Is Squirtle going to be sent back in time and become the glitch? A pure representation of defiance of rules?
This series is awesome it was most definitely worth the wait  and i cant not wait for the next episode.
Finally
I can't believe charmanter actually died...
No wayyyyy
3 years later a video comes where wartortol  finds a time macine and saves charmander
IT'S BACK
What happened to piplup
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
damn this episode was heavy... poor charmander
College bookstore voicing in this
THE RETURN OF THE KING!
Everyone is rightfully complimenting the story, but I want to compliment the animation. Everything looks insanely good, especially compared to the first episodes.
No way
“Cold people are bad against Hot people” -Talking tree
Naw bro u gotta make episodes quicker some of us might not make it it to see it 🙏🏽
The last episode will be out in 2050

Finally it came out
Finally after a long time he put a video omg
The wait was worth it, 10/10 video
S O M E T H I N G
The second he called Chimchar "Char", I knew what was up. Did NOT expect him to be so high level though.
Well that took a Dark Turn
Chimchar da best
It's been 2 years I'm so happy :)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
E
Why did you kill off charmander
OMG ITS HERE THE HIGHLIGHT OF EVERYTHING POKEMON THE LONG WAIT WILL BE WORTH IT.
because charizard is my favorite pokemon 😢😢😢😢😢
Finally
IVE NEVEER CLICKED SO FUCKIN FAST IN MY LIFE
Lol Mewtwo is still trying to kill that obomination
Nice bois let's wait for 3 years for ep 11

Wartortle Ultra Instinct

WHAT I JUST REMEMBERED EATCHING THESE LIKE 5 YEARS AGO AND THEY RELEASED ONE TODAY
It’s finally released me happy
Oh shit!
yoo it’s been years ur finally back
Icant wait for the next episode
Squirtle has always been the protagonist actually... He obviously suffering PTSD losing charmander. It's actually messed up dead head as a hat. So true about friendship, some of my closest friends in world been my greatest enemies and I never even talk to them. Lol
Is everybody going to ignore the fact that mewtwo was battling that glitch
I'm no beaver
Can you make charizard  live pls 😭😭😭😭😭
Dang Squirtle looks so old after the 10 year incident
Finally pokemon from other regions this episode please revive Charmander please
OH MY GOD ITS FINALLY HERE
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!!
ih
To be continued... "Huh, so this is what it feels like to have my heart ripped out of my chest. Good to know."  Not that it isn't worth it, but damn. This episode took a million dark turns in less than thirty minutes and I love/cried at every one of them. Amazing, and I am willing to wait another ten years for the next episode.
Make episode 11
No charmader
OH MY  GOD CALM DOWN EVERYONE
Is that a Everstone around Squirtle?
Don’t mess with kratos …. I meant bluey
Goodness, it's been quite the journey, hasn't it? I look forward to whatever comes next.
THE WARIO APPARITION-https://youtu.be/DqozgvoHCVQ
PTSD squirtle
Im gonna miss Charmander such a great character. Much better than Chimchar
I really happy that I can see episode 10 in a really long time so I can't wait to see episode 11 but I hope it doesn't take that long to release
OMG ITS HAPPENING
Woohoo! Can't wait for next year for the next episode!  (More seriously, nice work!)
Can’t believe Charmander actually died. And bulbasaur left. AND SQUIRTLE EVOLVED?
Please let Charmander come back as a Charmeleon or Charizard somehow... This was a sad episode but good! Well worth the wait!
This show has been on for 8 years 🥲
¡Eh esperado mucho tiempo para esto!  XD
broooo no way
Yes
It was wayyyyyy worth the wait
2:04 almost death i said almost
Welp see you in 2 years
Omg so good
I really hope they bring back charmander
I love how I keep getting adverts right in the transition of the start of Squirtle's flashbacks. Like, all his flashbacks are just ads.
Also bring back charm Andre and bulb-sore
To give you an idea of how old this series is Pokémon Y wasn’t even out when the first episode came out
Pls dont take a year to make ep 11 and 12
Finally
I can’t believe charmander died he was my favorite
Plot twist the Charmander is alive and he's the one at the top of the mountain or it's bulbasaur
I saw Mewtwo still fighting miasingnoe or I think that's it's na-
This just popped up in my feed, I just immediately tapped, bc you usually take a year, it's ok, take your time :)    Edit: happy Halloween..!
This was truly worth the wait!
Wow, the last episode's ending really *was* an epilogue to something grand and tragic. Charmander's story truly ended on that bleak of a note. Squirtle lost his empathy. Bulbasaur never escaped his fate, because he didn't *want* to. And the Caterpie leader just walked away after instigating the end of all life, Pokémon *and* mankind, in Kanto. The characters we've come to know for 9 episodes, except one, are gone. The Starter Squad we've enjoyed for the past 8 years... is over, and we didn't even get to say good-bye to it, because there was no way of knowing that we *had* to. But whatever happened to Mewtwo? Isn't Missingno still a threat, waiting to pop up again any day? I hope they weren't Red Herrings! Don't leave us hanging on those!  On the brighter side of things, though, the evolution was awesome! If our boy, best Starter, has grown *this* much stronger after evolving once, i'd love to see what kind of damage he'd be able to do in his *final* form.  I eagerly await the next installment, where i'm pretty sure Wartortle is going to meet with the gods and defy the laws of nature. Even if he has to Tackle Arceus himself, he's going to give himself another chance at having a team, a circle of friends, a family, or die trying to get it.  With how much Starter Squad episodes have grown in scale by now, i'm expecting Episode 11 (provided nothing happens to cease episode production altogether) to be done and out by the series' 10th anniversary at the earliest.
YOO THIS EPISODE IS AWSOME MAN. ALL OF MY RESPECT GOES TO YOU
A BLASTOISE WILL SMASH ARCEUS? PLEASE! DO IT! GO WARTORTLE! EVOLVE MORE AND SHOW YOUR TRUE POWER!
no way finally
This episode was extremely entertaining, but the story is a little bit okay to me. I like the fact that they made us have high expectations for Charmander when the sad and realistic truth was that there was nothing anybody could have done to stop his death. The Caterpie destruction of the forest was really cool, and I think Squirtle's way of coping with Bulbasaur's separation and Charmander's death by using Turtwig and Chimchar was sweet but sad. In the end, the same thing happened, Turtwig left and Chimchar died. Also, Abomasnow as a reflection of Squirtle being a soldier was creative, and Squirtle's epic god mode was cool. The story is nice, but I am just sad that we are probably never getting more of Charmander, and probably Bulbasaur too. Honestly, I dislike Chimchar, and Turtwig is not nearly as good as Bulbasaur, but it was still fun to see what happened. I expect Mewtwo and the cave he was talking about in that past episode is going to be brought up, but we shall see. Based on what I have seen so far though, I don't think I am going to be much a fan of this, I've never been a fan of time skips and showing much things have changed, it just kind of sucks and lets out a bad vibe. Still fun episode though.
Finally
Ah shnap... I hope doesn't end up being several years for the continuation or if anything at least a finale.
epic
I've been waiting for 4 years
Finally
We did not deserve this
Charmander actually died?! Thats ballsy
time to wait another 100 years 💀
The DR chapter 2 vibes in this are... Sinister
He dose seem very changed after evolution but it will still be interesting to see what is next & who he will see
Have to be honest.... Pretty upset Charmander is dead....
Ep 10 let’s go
Its finally here
this makes no sense if you didnt watch the first 9  Edit: still doesnt
Hope bulbasaur returns at least for the final.
Yay finally :D it came!
I knew squirtle was gonna evolve
Yes it’s finally here🥳🤩🥳🤩🥳🤩!!!!
7:25 what are the words on the head of Charmander there can someone say what it means
This is the only thumbnail that doesn’t have Charmander lol
Finaly after all theese years... We got it gentlmen
JESUS FINALLY A NEW ONE!
What about Charmander  and Bulbasaur
Wowwww! Having seen the whole series up to now, this is by far my favorite! It was truly immersive, especially during the "Snow" confrontation. The Snover were hilarious all the way and that arm getting destroyed... Wartortle must have learned Strength during evolution because that was brutal! I also was taken aback by the flashbacks, it made me feel sad for Squirtle but this whole episode is a character arc in my eyes. Congratulations dude! To the entire team for such a incredible episode, the effort shows through and through. That passion for Pokémon is there and I love every second of it. I am really happy that I get to see each episode and how it just keeps improving.
After 30 fucking years its here
#11 2029
20:35 Squirtle is a zombie to Caterpie because in the games, the more you train with your Pokémon, the better they follow your orders and fight for you (as in they become more attached to their trainer). Which is why his facial expression changes when he is released.
What if one of the gods is charmander (now a Charizard) as a ghost boss thing.
Make more pls
YTESSSSS AYYYY
Squirtle evolved so the gods upon the mountains will have an excuse to use their 100% of their power.
THIS EPISODE WENT HARD AF!!!!!!!
I...was not expecting this.  They're in Sinnoh though...wonder if certain legendaries of time and space can help set things right. (okay, so I mostly just miss Charmander because I loved his character growth)
omg !, when is the next one
When everyone needed him he returned
I feel like the story has gotten even better this time around. Keep it up!
Ok now another 2 years XD
The wait is over. It returns
OMG I CANT BELIEVE THE DAY HAS COME
Welp see you all in 2-3 years
after all this time its finally released.
Seven years
The LEGEND HAS RETURNED!!!!!
"Wait, really?" were my first thoughts upon seeing this.
It’s been awhile fellow trainers
This is way more darker than I thought.
Without bulbasaur and charmander it’s not really the starter squad
They just gone over that charmander died like "oh yeah charmander died"
Episode 11 coming in 10 years
are you guys thinking the starter squad ating more epoisdes
Welp, Charmander is confirmed to be one and with Gastly now
I am very sad that Next Episode takes more than 2 Years
FINALLY
FINALLY our king has returned, also I see how this took 10,000 years
no fucking way it's out
wow so good ps do pt 11
PLS ADD CHARMADER BACK PLS
Bidoof.
This is..... FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!
Now we need WarSquirter to evolve into Blastoise in one of the newer episodes, Ep. 10 was amazing! Kinda knew Charmander died but at the same time I hoped he some how made it out.
Lets goo ep tean
Chimchar: Anarchy will prevail Me: thinking of dream smp
ITS BACKKKKKKK LETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO
12:49 anyone else noticed Mewtwo right there?
why did Charmander need to die
Fuck bro I don't like this ending :'(((((
All I gotta say is well done with those Snovers, they had me going 😂
wtf why did you make charmander die
I really wish Charmander didn't have to die but what Squirtle did was so badass when he evolved
Im so glad that ep 10 is finally out but im gonna miss charmander.
Wait if charmander is dead would he be a gastly?
I just realized charamander was probably tortured to death because of all the death he caused and squirtle probably saw it happening and that honestly is pretty scary.
😔☔️ man charmander is really dead wow
llleeetttttttsss ggggggooooooooooooooooo !!!!
Yes
Is caterpie a sith lord now? XD
Wow i cant believe ep 10 dropped today but remember 1 exact year ago he called a vid 3 ep left i wonder what 11 and 12 will be like
you can not tell me charmander is gone
Damn Charmander dead.
Notice that chimchar debuted on this episode and died the same episode, I just have to say wow.
He gonna ask something :○
He's going to get Dialga to send him back in time, he has to.
THIS IS SO COOL
No not charmander
YES FOR SO LONG WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
the bird sillouhette and the nidoking shading was a really cool way to make missingno. great episode
LETS GOOOOO! I missed seeing these 😩
do more! I love it
You wanna know why am sad I’m probably gonna have to wait a year or two for the next epic part of this awesome tale
WOW BOW WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YR FOR NXT EPISODE ???
I love the Snowvers
yES it’s HERE!
Two more left
FINNALYYYYYY
ITS BEEN YEARS FINALLY
I wonder where the Missingno subplot will reoccur?
Charmander is dead!!!!noooooooo he was sic!!!
Waiting for episode 11
I was just talking about this yesterday and its back lol
Wow, so charmander died. would've been nice to SEE. I have so many questions now, like where is bulbasaur, how did turtwig, squirtle, and chimchar meet, is bulbasaur in cerulean cave because that's mewtwo told them where to meet him? speaking of That's a nice easter egg, all this time and he's still fighting, I can only imagine how pissed off he is.
ITS FINALLY HERE
:)
When will the next episode drop? This was so good!
its been so long
Chimchar reminds me of technoblade lol
Finally
WOOOOO! ITS HERE
I OMG
Rip for those who thought the Og Squad will return 😔
I see Mewtwo at 12:51
why charmander is not charmander? im lost :(
Imagine if charizard (charmander) is the god but forgot his past.
Yes i have 2 more years =D
Not charmander😭
:D
Definitely worth the wait. Can’t wait to see what happens next!
Finally
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
FINALLY!
NGL I half expected Squirtle to smash the Everstone in his hand like Shigaraki with his Father's hand before destroying Deika.
"lets make like the fire ape say something that relates to like real world events and make it very blunt so it is like oddly specific and therefore funny haha" didnt work.
R.I.P charmander😭
Well the next epsiodes coming in 3 years, really excited! Also the quality has increased quite a lot
Idk how but y’all made me fing love snover
Charmander's death caught me off guard considering he was one of the main characters
Mewtwo still fighting Missingno. That's awesome, but I don't like Squirtle being Main Character. I was so invested in Charmander.
It really is sad that charmander actually died when in his dying moments he really did care about squirtle and when squirtle didn't save him he regretted it for the rest of his life
12:07 Gotta love that Movieunleashers cameo
This was unexpected turn for the story to take, but I'm liking it.
After all these years
The man, the legend has returned with a new episode 😁it was worth the wait
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
EXE
So, when's the next? 2024😁😁😁
GOD DAMN, those few years really paid off huh? THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. Also the voice acting is amazing <3
Chimchar is so fucking annoying
To.  Day.  I.  Am.    6
finally
I WAS WATCHING A SOMG AND THEN SAW THIS AND FLIPPED AAHAHHHHH❤️‍🩹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥❤️❤️‍🔥❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥
Why did the characters change?
you back
There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth fairy, and there is no *beaver society* !
I doubt it before this episode but it was actually true:( 7:57
Please don’t make us wait another 2 years 😭😤!
I was really big fan of charmandar but now he is dead like every other character I ever liked.
THE WAIT IS OVERRR YESSS
After all the wait, episode 10 is here and it's incredible! It must've been a lot of work, episode 9 was 2 years ago!
Wartortle us about to make them reverse time while retaining his memories so he can redo everything the right way. That's my guess.
Time traveller: *b r e a t h e s* The timeline: 24:01
WOOOOHOOOOOO
THIS SERIES IS LITERALLY SO COOL OMG WTF !?!!?!?
I don't know if I can bring myself to watch I waited so long
This was amazing! Definitely worth the wait
When the Doom music kicks in
Amari.  Johnson
I'm happy Bulbasaur got a happy ending.
The new voice at the end tho🥴💕
it's been 10,000 years...
The ending got really “Animè” out of nowhere.😂
EPISODE 10 YEEEES
12:51 did anyone see mewtwo fighting missingno
It’s gonna take another year again
Woah, I thought Charmander would survive. Didn't expect a 10 year time skip. Look forward to episode 11!
awesome ep. I'm upset charmander death an wear hat. any more episode ?
12:51 mewtwo is attacking missingno
12:50 was that the glitch and mewtwo?
Charmander died?!
Team squirtle for life
i love this, absolutely well written
This series has really grown into something special! I love that there are still jokes and Easter eggs sprinkled in, though. Well done, Shipp!
FINALLY
Sqitrle is became kratos and chimchar and turtwing is atreus Im sad because charmader die
Turtwig was smart to turn back…….
WHOA
NO FUCKING WAY
i think wartortle will meet dialga in the top of the mountain and he will ask him to go back in time and meet charmander again
Wow, I've waited long enough to see what happens next!
Finally I had to wait to much
When I realize he started to try to call them by his original friends names I realize he was going through Denial
OMG ITS OUT NOW!!! my longest wait was for this
Dilaga needs to come to save charmander
I can't believe Charmander is really dead. What a waste of narrative potential
Amazing. Saw it twice. This is gold!!!!
When I saw his head I was like it can't be... is that charmander's head?
Nice bro’s trending!!!
I been waiting is long for that
YES ITS HERE AT LAST ANOTHER PAGE IN THE LEGENDARY BOOK OF STARTER SQUAD!!!
This was amazing!  See you in 2 years! 🥳😅
Are we gonna wait for another 2 years for another vid
Finally after three years of waiting today is finally the day
SHIPPIDDGE....YOUR ALIVE!!!!
I know literally everyone will comment the same thing but uh…  ITS FINALLY HERE BOYS
Talking trees are just a vibe you know?
YO
I wanna know what happened to charmander it says he died but he could have survived
Omg charmandet died
18:22  Actually it is Chimchar’s fault, he was a hyper-individualistic and “Muh independence” a-hole who couldn’t step out of his own ego, just like Charmander.
After 8 years wow congratulations man
So he's gonna ask dialga to reverse time so he can fix everything that went wrong
I hope Charmander comes back from the dead. Let's hope for the best.
Who’s watched this more than once? ⬇️
Bro, just yes
Am i watching god of war gameplay lol
Loved it 10/10 no cap
I wanted charmander to be alive 🙂
Bulbasourus got the saddest ending n-n-n-nnn NO HATTTTT 😭😭😭
After one fucking year.
Thank you so much I love this I just really hope the old team gets back together
You must to continues this fuckinh story no matters what 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This series has grown up with me
I love how everyone expected Charmander to live but then in the middle of the video Squirtle is like “Yeah Charmander died”
Remember the Missing No. Arc? I have a theory, what if the Pokemon god on top of the mountain in Missing No.?
Finally, also yay, bidoof!
Finallllyyyy! Thanks for the hard work !
22:50 Wartortle used shell smash it was super effective
Congrats at making the 10th episode it's so amazing I wish I could make something like that
Every time it finishes I want to cry because I have to wait another year
This was amazing
YAYYYY
Bruh how old am I gonna be when you finish this series
Charmander is dead is 😭😭😭
Make Part 11
🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽
thats was awesome
See you all next year.
IT'S TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME
I wait years for this :,D
I wasn't expecting this to happen! This is amazing, I've watched these since I was little kid :)
Damn I cant believe charmander actually died damn
Arceus & MissingNo v. Mega Blastoise & Mega Mewtwo. Who shall win!?!
so this is turning into god of war but pokemon? N I C E
Just please wipe your feet when you get here, Wartortle  I just had the floors cleaned
Great Stuff!
Time to wait a whole other year for the next episode
I feel kinda bad for Turtwig. I also really like Turtwig and hope he comes back. He didn't seem to mind following Squirtle around where ever when he thought they were friends, and then Squirtle forgot his name and called him Bulbasaur.
prediction: i think wartortle will meet arceus palkia and dialga, they will duke it out then they will come to an agreement. after that they will go back in time to episode one where they all get picked by a trainer
This Was worth the wait
To think I was 12 when the series started
Welp time to wait 2 more years
Broo I’m so hyped, I’ve waited so long😄😭
YAY IT'S FINALY BACK. I missed this.
oh finally after 1 whole year
The Caterpie Leader is basically like Injustice Superman at this point.
This was amazing and I'm super-hyped for the final two episodes. This show's writing has reached new heights far above how it was at the start and I hope you're proud of it.  Also, I love the fact that this takes place 10 years later in Sinnoh because that's how many years Diamond and Pearl were released after Red/Green.
I hate how charmander is dead
Cool
FINALLLLYYYYYYYYY
How dos charmander die
You can’t keep holding on to the pass. The only thing that matter is what you choose to do now
YESSSS IVE BEEN WAITING
F*cking finally it took so long but the wait was worth it but I did age 2 years in the process
ITS BEEN 3000 YEARS
Aww charmander died
The story took such an interesting and original turn! Great job, exceeded my expectations
Squirtle has become Kratos.
It’s a shame charmander died. I really liked charmander
Plz tell me this is an alternative reality
YES EP 10 IS HERE
after me waiting 2 years this is the bs you managed bro i was expecting something much better im ngl
I know ya'll are talking about squirtle or charmander, but where is piplup here?
I wish Charmander was alive
Its back!!!!!
Is…is it real?… it’s been a whole year
Can’t believe it’s been years
Now don’t just work on another vid for like 2 or 1 ㄚ乇卂尺丂丂丂丂丂丂
ITS OUT OMG
Omgggggg
2:34  Squirtle's back throw in smash be like:
Wartortle has never been this badass🔥
Pog
OH MY GOD IT FINALLY CAME OUT
epic
LEZ GOOOOOOOOO

Oh so Charmander is actually dead
Amazing episode... see ya in 3 years for ep 11 😔
(Next episode)In breaking news of Pokemon daily: A level 100 blue water spurting turtle defeated level 70 Arceus, The creator of everything.
Tak
Charmander his head is a hat how brutal
I knew squirtle was the best choice!
Finally
why did they change everything about the series in one episode  they killed off the main character just suddenly..? squirtle didn’t do anything?? i feel offended i waited for this, i’m sorry but.. why kill off the main character and make one character suddenly op without explication? as a story writer, i just.. have no words.
Oh shit its here?
I love the snover lol
I wonder what happened to bulbasaur
I didn’t expect this to come out this year but here we are 💯
What’s the name of the music at 17:00
Omg ! After all of these years, it’s finally here!!!
Finally after 2 years of waiting
What happened to charmander
Finally dude
hardcore wartortle......hardcore....
imagine its charmander or bulbasaur up there
FINALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH SHIPPIDDGE
AHHH IVE WAITED FOR THIS FOR MONTHS! THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY! THANKS FOR MAKING ME HAPPY AND I HOPE THERE IS MORE EPISODES OF THISSSSS
Finally!!
OMG THIS IS SICK
After 2 years the best pokemon animationer is back
It’s amazing how well you got the cultish feeling from the caterpie army when whiskers said “I believe in us” in that second to last flashback  100%worth the wait
I love this
Omg
YESSSS
I've been waiting for real long time!
OMG
Plot twist: the whole series is a dream/nightmare
I hope they reverse time and  bring back the old crew
Itching to know how Missingno gets involved in all this. Since we see it briefly during the War it definitely hasn't been forgotten about.
2 years ago.
Yay but what is he gona ask
It got Dark real quick…
YES FINALLY
I thought Charmander would’ve evolved. Not die
Dude i thought this day would never come
L
no fucking way i never thought this day would come
Welp it’s here boys it’s finally here
Ain’t no way bruh
WOOHOOO!!! AFFTER A YEAR OR TWO, ITS OUT!!!
Yes! I've rewatched the other episodes like a million times, and this one is finally out!
Imagine a pokemon lime mega ray or even dialga or palkia or even arceus himself. Or, A different pokemon?
So when is part 11 coming
Cool but when is ep 11 coming out

Squritle:*about have a death match*.              The tree Pokemon:oh cool sounds good

The Return of The King
It's finally here and now Squirtle has his own journey hope EP 11 come in sooner
The nostalgia...... Seeing this again
I want charmander to come back
Yessss
Shippiddge
Each and every episode you keep improving the story, characters and animation! You seriously exceed my expectations!  And I'm really happy to see you animate Turtwig (and not kill him off)! He's my first and favourite starter and becomes my favourite Pokémon.
"To be continued" we're getting more?! Oh thank goodness my heart sank watching Squirtle spiraled into depression then left alone with Charmander decapitated & Bulbasaur missing, hope he'll get his good ending eventually!
Greetings to you
Omg what a way to wake up
you better give us more... ;)
That monkey sound like gohan
Is flareon still alive? I’m curious
Well well well
Finaly
THANK FUCKING YOU
WTH IM SO LUCKY DUDE! EVERYTIME I REWATCH SOMETHING THE NEW EPISODES COME OUT
OMG SO EXITED AHHHHH
YES YES YESSSS
I dont like that charmander died, maybe make squirtle revive everyone
Welp gotta wait two more years for the next one.
you mean to tell me I waited basically a lifetime just to figure out Charizard was dead Bulbasaur was gone and Squirtle had a 10-year time Jump and can't get rid of the past perfect
what happened to bulbasaur
It’s been 84 years.
Also notice that the vessel of the gods or the abomasnow said so you have chosen death
Only two more episodes to go.
A fire type that can deal 4x super effective damage against a pokemon *Loses*  A water type that doesn't even have the moves to fight a grass type *Wins in one hit*
Yay finally you uploaded and it’s only been 2 years
Big Bibby is the best character in this series by far.
LES GO FINALLY
Oh. My. God.
#1 reason why I hate caterpies
I screamed, fell off the bed, and cried of joy.   *This was worth the wait*
I will never see Snover the way I used to do before this video. They are my favourite characters so far in this series ;D
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Make a video that metwo bring charmander to life and becomes stronger on 11 or 12
MY BOY SQUIRTLE EVOLVED LETS GOOOOOOO
OMG it’s finally back I missed this so much, I remember waiting for this for so long, and it’s pretty interesting, but I wish charmander didn’t die but tbh he wasn’t gonna evade that.
Yes finally!
Finally I’ve been waiting so long   That abomasnow looks sick holy crap squirtle is a god I’m speechless
I JUST FOUND THIS SERIES WHAT ARE RHE ODDS OF A NEW EP COMING OUT A WEEK LATER
My guess is that ep 12 will be blastoise will ask dialga to take him back in time to ep 1 prevent all this ever happening in the first place
FINALLY
Man, 28 minutes was still too short😭 I want the next episode already😭 Submission to a master took a really dark turn, what a bad decision for Squirtle. But that Wartortle? EPIC!
I totally forgot how episode 9 ended, RIP Charmander
Like worst scared Wartortle
A great birthday present. Yay
Finally... The god has returned...
We’ve waited about 2 years for this and I’m so happy to say it was worth it
ITS BEEN SOO LONGGG
Finally I’ve been waiting for so long 😞
after 2 years... its finally here
so Charmander really is gone damn
Dang. This was intense. It's so good and I can hardly stand the wait for the series to be finished. If only Shippiddge had the resources he deserves to release these episodes every week like any other show on this level.
After watching this, I am amazed as always by the animation and quality. But my main focus isn't that, it is the story. Charmander dying was a bad idea but I know it was for the best in the story. The fact that squirtle (wartortle) goes through that soul-less stage of fighting a war. Going through war, getting depressed, losing all emotion, these are all factors that are in the terrors of war. After Squirtle fights for a decent amount of time. The 3 flashbacks were my favourite scenes, they give a brief amount of ideology behind Squirtle and the numerous amount of fights he went through. The "Gods" that the Obamasnow speaks of is definitely palkia and dialga adding to the lore aspect. Overall this episode was the most depressing/best one yet.
Pokemon Red/Green JPN version was released in 1996, Pokemon diamond and pearl was released in 2006. thats a nice detail right there
So squirtle has bags now?
YeS
Well now where going to wait about a year or 2 to see what is up there
I can't believe charmander is actually dead holy shit
the starter squad is great, loved ep 1-9
Is this a god of war reference?
For a moment i thought charmander got reincarnated as chimchar till i saw squirtle
wooooooo
Time to wait until 2022 when episode 11 gets released.
I SAW MEWTO AT 12:49
Shippedidde posting the 10th episode. Me impossible
HOLLY CRAP IT'S BeEN 2 YEARS BUT I AM SO FRICKIN HAPPY RIGHT NOW
Sooooo good. Can't wait for the next episode next year
When does the next episode come out?
Again this all started because charmander didnt get chosen by the trainer
Finnaly it only took a year im literally 2 years away from being an adult
Thank you for ep 10 I've been waiting for years
It’s been so long thank you
So cool
For so long
Finaly something to look!
...and squirtle went full Kratos.... You can never go back when You do that.... Or can he? Because Dialga and time, etc.... Stay tune for the next episode of Starter Squad Z!
This series is epic!
Well... this was worth the wait
CHARMANDER HAT
WHAT
Damn he went from the most logical and rules guy to revenge and attack. It also started when charmander said to squirtle "If your going to survive out here you gotta learn to toughen up" And he did  Btw if caterpie lost everything does that mean caterpie lost bulbasaur?
FING finally
THIS IS AWESOMEEE!!!!!!  But I'm still sad that Charmander died and that we didn't get to see characters like bulbasaur and mewtwo.  But this was still so good
The trees sound like someone from OutKast
Pokemon in your 30s :
bro youtube sold and its not even 720p
That was AMAZING and really dark like really really dark but still amazing but dark I guess it is just squirtle squad now
Y E S FINALY
That gave me *rules of nature* vibes
The goddamn wait is  finally over.
I've been watching this series since I was in middle school, and I'm graduating high school in the spring, holy fuck
wow
I can't believe charemader is dead
Chimchar sounds like dub Luffy
Something tells me that they might run into that Bidoof that Squirtle threw 😅
The journey begins. Godspeed Wartortle.
did everyone miss the fact that mewtwo is fighting missingno for 10 years and still fighting him
This hurts as my discord profile is bidoof
I watched to the End WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO BE CONTINUED HOW LONG WILL THIS SERIES BE (sorry pressed caps lock)
Ummmmmmmm can we look at the fact that Wartortle used shell smash but without the speed boost
Charmander..........🙀
yes yes yes yes yes yes
First charmander died then Leonard but squirtle evolved:D this is gonna be amazing and I can't wait to see more ( r.i.p charmander and Leonard)
Oh..... disappointment..... but ill keep watching I miss bulbasuar.......
Absolutely loved this episode! Can’t wait for the next one :)
its probably gonna be the humans thats telling them what to do
See ya in 2 years man. Thanks for the content.
Its Been 2 Years....Finally...
12:50
YESSSSSSSSSS FINALLY
Gahahhahahahh please moreeeee
It’s heavily implied that the God of Gods Pokémon is Arceus, but he actually says Arceus in Japanese. アルセウス
After 10 years mewtwo is still cleaning up the mess yikes
This is still a thing?
They really killed off charmander and bulbasaur
Wow.....
OMG finnaly Parts 10!!?😁
Amazing episode. 😁😁😁. Looking foward for the next episode
In 2024-2025 the 11th will get released
My fav series ever
Omg no way. Finally the wait is over
so now we wait another year? great.
YAS FINALLY. It's so good. When he said "something" I died of laughter.
I was hoping I would see Bulbasaur with Squirtle but no also Caterpie found out what power Squirtle would have and released him for her safety her final words "Goodbye Squirtle"
Finally… finally after all these years the slowpoke did it!!!!!!! I love you!!!!!
Finally another episode I’ve been waiting
i hope charmander get revenge but using a revive potion
Gotta say… worth the wait.
OMG HES BACK
its been so long, i forgot i was waiting for this
Thank you
I’ve been waiting for this for years
poor bidoof's :(
CLEAN ANIMATION

FINALLY
Oh boy! Episode 10 is out. That means the next episode will take LONGER to come out. I'll probably be dead before episode 11 but if I can still see it wether I'm in heaven or a ghost it'll be worth it!
Nooooo charmander

12:51 Mewto

I miss charmander he did not deserve this
Very nice ending.
well now. a welcome surprise.
We did not expect that. In positive meaning! But woooah - finally after this long time! Amazing work, great story idea and we can't wait for more O-O
We waited so long that Shippidge evolved from Slowpoke to Slowking  Galarian Form.
ITS HAPPENING
No. Actual. Way.
Took 2 years but it was ao worth the wait, but honestly its so sad that charmander died, i think all of thought that he whould just evolve and kill caterpie, but i guess this could be a continuation too
It’s crazy how far this series has got
Thank you for content
This took a really dark turn
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Awesome... just thinking about the glitches caused by pokeball what happened of them
I'm surprised to see how much change this series went through. I'm excited for ep 11
Long awaited and just as awesome as we thought it would be just in a different way
finallyy
I think I've underestimated warturtles too much...
Righteous.  Is that Greg from DawnSomewhere?! I love that guy…
love it
It's not over because it is 2 more left if I'm not wrong
Riiiiiip charmander
2 years of waiting for this It was all worth the wait

iv waited to long and i kinda forgot about this now ill watch this 10 times
FINALLY
It's been 10,000 years
It’s been forever but it was worth the wait
Everybody mad because Charmander died while I want Bulbasaur back
0:58 techno son
This was kinda lame
FINALLY
It’s finally happened
Oh my god finnely
1 year later
AFTER SO MANY YEARS HE FINALLY HERE
FINNALY
It’s been like three goddamn years
This evolution was 8 years in the making, and I gotta be honest, it was worth the wait.
I guess we finally know the fate of Charmander
Can't wait for episode 11!!! I wonder what happens to Bulbasaur???
When Turtwig calls Squirtle out for calling him Bulbasaur and you realise he's been calling Chimchar 'Char' the whole time :((((  Edit: Char as in he's been referring to Charmander...
Анархия-мама сынов своих любит
Its about time its been 2 years ever since the last episode been realeasted
so which level that abomasnow was? level 70? for a level 98 squirtle not being able to defeat it sure it was pretty high
Omg finally I was so worried but finally you uploaded
I'm depressed that Charmander got such an anticlimactic ending. I was hoping he'd actually evolve or something and Squirtle was going to go save him. Boo.   :( now not sure if I want to see the final ep. Charmander deserved better.  Your animation has gotten fantastic though. And I'd watch a spinoff with the Snovers
I've been waiting like 5 years for this shit
BRUHHHHH CHARMANDER DIED???? he WAS MY FAVOIRTE
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE 11th episode
Ii hate you guys
SQUIRTLE EVOLVES IN THIS EPISODE????
Here we go boys
Finally I love love love love this series
Where Bulbusaur
Yes finally
HOLY MOTHER CRAP HES BACK
HOLY SHITTTT
This episode was great, depressing but great. If the last two episodes are good as this one or better, than it’s worth the wait for them.
Come on why didn’t charmander make a comeback this series is starting to fall off a bit
I really hope it doesn't take 2 years to make episode 11
YES
Fun Fact: The Charmander Head On The Front Says Victory
FINALLY
Pls finish this series
OH ITS ON MY RECOMMENDED LETS GO
Finally AFTER SEPHIROTH LONG OF YEARS edit:Charmander acutally died well that means for me a justified reason why i go and kill caterpies now.
Pretty bad ass episode i compleatly forgot this series exsisted, So i was surprised to see an episode drop. Thanks for your 2 years of hard work man the outcome was fantastic.
And now we wait for another 2 years
outstanding, absolutely outstanding!
Finally
Soooo gooood
10:09 Deku and Bakugou's friendship in a nutshell.
After 2 years later it’s finally here
Charmender died so no more interest in this series bye
If whiskers was still alive
FINALLY AFTER 100 000 YEARS!!!!
Im already a skeleton it took so long
YES FINALLY FOR OVER 4 YEARS I HAVE BEEN WAITING ITS FINALLY HERE!!! OOH YEA IM SOOO HYPEEE 4 YEARS THAT TOOK WAAAY TOO LONG
BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS SIT DOWN AND ENJOY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
You guys really killed him 🥺
Thank you so much for this series! I know we have, I think, one more episode left, but I'll stand the wait no matter how long.
To be Concluded?  I sure hope so. He will only stay as a Wartortle at lvl 98 for so long, I can’t wait to see Blastoise, maybe even the Mega variant,
if squirtle does not ask the gods for charmander back im gonna be MAD!
I watched this when it released but I needed a couple hours because charmander died and bulbasaur most likely died since the leader caterpie said they lost everything and bulbasaur wanted to stay with the caterpie army squirtle also evolved a Chimchar died wartortle is level 99 dude it is hard to cope with this holy jesus
The gods better revive my boy😭
Calling it now: the “gods of space and time” are going to send Wartortle back in time to undo his mistake. Because this episode made all those deaths suddenly feel really heavy.
Finally let’s gooooooooo
Wait, what? charmander? really? just like that? What happened to mewtwo? I demand answers :(
Damn squirtle broke that birds jaw
See every one in 2 years
Va a aver subtítulos Al español algún día? O no está en los planes por ahora?
Yesss thank you I must know what happened
Nooo charmander noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He died😭😢😿
Literally just rewatched 9 yesterday
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
At first I was shocked at the large time gap and that Charmander died. But then I realized what region Squirtle was in and realized that everything would be fine thanks to Dialga
CARMANDER WHY
Why did Charmander have to die :(
Why did you make character die you should of made him evolve are something why I say WHY!!
i forgot about this
This was so cool see you guys in 2 years
Finaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally!
Thank god finally
Bro, having to wait for each episode makes each release just more satisfying.
Are we going to see Dialga, Master of Time
This title I bet was just made up
sheeshhhhh🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
WHAT STARTER SQUAD IS BACK
What a great yearly release. Can’t wait for the next one
Did squirtle grind to lv. 98 at Viridian Forest?
DAY. MADE
There is 2 more
The fact that most of us grew up with this series is crazy and we still come back
AAAAAHHH NEW EPISODE
That was awesome! Shoutouts to everyone who worked on this!
The wait is done, I was so happy when i saw this on my recommendations. Great job on the video!
nice!
Wow, that was amazing! Time to wait until 2024 for the next episode (in all seriousness this is the good shit)
Charmander die it sad but it mark send not go get away with that
Wartortle is my favorite 2ndary Pokemon starter of all time.
Anyone know where misingno was in this episode
This vidéo is just so cool but don’t translate in french or other language 🥺
yessssss
Amazing!!
YES YES FINALLY ITS HERE
It's finally here O-O I LOVE YOU SHIPP
see ya all 5 years from now for episode 11
... Why, Charmander? Regardless, Thank you for making the next episode! I'm kinda glad you added other gens! While I'm pissed charmander had to "like, actually die, die", this still has some comedy and epicness in it. "BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME!" Is probably one of my favorite quotes now lmao
Really cool, you can really see the evolution of the series trough the series as a whole. I don't know, this change of things was really radical i'm sure it will be awesome but for now it caught me off guard and maybe it was a bit soon to kill charmander. Also, where's Bulbasaur?
ITS BEEN TOO LONG
squirtle is so badass
That Wartortle’s a level 99 correct?
i cant wait for episode 11
Dang it!!!!! NOW WE GATTA WAIT A WHOLE YEAR FOR THE NEXT ONE!!!!! 🤬
YEEEEES
LES GOOO FINALLY
See y'all in another year for the next episode!
God dammit, I'm depressed now
Don’t forget, squirtle was the one who was picked by the trainer in episode 1. Between the trainer, then charmander, then squirtle, he never had any opportunity to learn how to be independent. It’s such an incredible continuity over the whole series that I refuse to believe this wasn’t Ship’s plan from the very start.
I’ve been anticipating this episode for sooo long
Moral: Don't kill caterpies
Squirtle - Sinner Charmander - Dead Bulbasaur - Careless  Chimchar - Charmander 2.0 Turtwig - Smart
finnally it fells like its the end of the world this was released
this is so good ive been waiting for the last ep for ages
THE LEGEND IS BACK
Holt crap apples that was an awesome ending!
-_-
I’m so sad there was so much death and my 2nd fav character is dead it was great though
Well the animation is a ton better! Time well spent!
A bit sad but i like the new main character
it only took you a year
Snover was hilarious
Brooo I'm so sad that charmander didn't make it, he was such a good character T-T I hope that the caterpie will be killed by the kratos version of squirtle x)
I still can’t believe Charmander is dead
Getting a lot of god of war vibes.
FINALLYOMG FINALLY
Time to wait 2 more years yeah
The king has returned🥳🥳🥳
YAY NEW EPISODE  I’ve been waiting for this for the past like 2 years
Definitely worth the wait as expected. Can’t wait for Episode 11 in 2023 (or later lol)!
Finally it’s feel so long but so short
Sick, can't wait for next year!
So, Wartortle is now in Gen 4, considering he’s going after “The Gods”, he probably means Dialga, Palkia, Arceus and MAYBE Giratina. Maybe he’ll somehow beat them and go back in time to get Charmander back.
Well can't wait for another 2 years for the next part
*shadow of colossus moment*
Thank you for this video. Amazing job.
I fucking hate all caterpies
THAT WAS THE FASTEST I EVER CLICKED A VIDEO.. ITS FINALLY HERE!!
Noooo charmander!
This is, by far, one of the best fan series based on Pokemon that I've seen. I'm glad you're back, dude!
I have a question that what happened to mewtwo I mean wasn't charmander supposed to meet him at cerulean cave but he died. I mean what is going on?
22:49 I guess killing all those bird Pokemon maxed out his speed EVs
Omg it’s finally here :)))
And now we have something akin to Glitchtale
Not worth the wait
Abomasnow(Snow) Look like it was fused with a Trevenant Also awesome episode
Holy shit Its here
We have to wait a other year?
Omg finally this was definity worth the wait 1000%
HFS it's back!!!
Me after seeing this in my recommendations-This is where the fun begins
Dude, that was awsome. Congrats I just miss the comedy
CHARMANDER ACTULLYED DIED NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! HE WAS MY FAVORITE POKEMON
When will the next one come out?
Oh my charmander! You just let a main character of the previous 9 episodes die?
YES!!! I have waited soo long
Only two more episodes left
OH MY GOD
Les go
No fucking way.
Amazing. You outdid yourself, now the wait is finally over...
That was awesome...... Squirtle evolving and having some hidden power that's INSANE!!!!!
Is it me or the end just hits different?
I am never gonna get over charmander dieing
Gotta admit charmander was my favorite one out of them and seeing him die actually made me feel some type of way. This was awesome
Yay new vid
I’ll be honest I always liked Charmander more than Squirtle and was so mad when I saw his decapitated head on Caterpie, during the wait I was hoping that this episode would reveal Squirtle getting off his high horse and going through hell for his actions and Charmander eventually coming back to kill Caterpie, but no, this was much better than what I had hoped, I hoped he would find a way to bring Charmander back, but I instead I want Squirtle to find peace
Wow i randomly searched for ep 10 n itz there
Omg
Omfg finally seems like I've been waiting forever
maybe episode 12 could bring bukbasaur back? maybe?  idk
that betrayer squirrel should die
I can’t wait for episode 11 two years later lol
YAY!
Absolutely amazing
Anyone realize that Squirtle turned into the Wartortle of War?
Yes now time to wait 2 more years for another one
that poor fearow!!!
Lets go
In episode 11 could you please explain what happened to charmander and bolbasore
OH MY GOD IT'S HERE
All because Charmander killed a Caterpie named Pablo.
Reeeeeeeeee
I have a feeling charmander might be either burning in Pokémon hell or helping mewtwo or even is one of the people wartortle will be fighting
I think a lot of people feel mixed because  of the shift of focus onto Squirtle, but to me it makes it more realistic. Can't wait to see what happened to Bulbasaur and the headband Caterpie!
I wish it was easier to make these,  I can't wait two years to see the next episode. That was breath-taking.
oh my this animation is amazing no wonder you took so long for this
I know this is my third comment, but something clicked. In Pokémon's lore, their relationship wasn't always mindless orders and "I believe in you ___". Supposedly, before Pokéballs people, even the early trainers, became partners with Pokémon because of mutual trust/gain. If Watortle does change the past, perhaps this is where the story would leave off: With a rejection of the dark society they were born in, but with the possibility of more peaceful, even empathetic improvement towards a fairer world.
OMG! It's so cool! I love it!
Holy cow Squirtle evolved
Dear god, this was amazingly well made. Great Job. Ill wait 30 years for the next one.
This is the best video on Youtube
Why did he kill off charmander
I’d still like to know if that Caterpie is a boy or a girl.
YESSSSSSSS FINALLLLY
Oof it was 2 am for me, missed out on it coming out
I love the snowbro
"W"
Awwee man, like im glad that the ep is out and it is realy well made and all. But damn i would lie if im not disappointed and sad also about the conclusion of Bulbasour and Charmander. There where so much time invested in them and now they just ended, rip Charmander :/
FINALLY
LOVE IT
Okay, i can understand why there was such a long gap between episodes. A lot went into this one. Also Snow looks awesome! Like a Nightmare Abomasnow. He sounded cool aswell.
finally ep 10 is here LETS GOOOOO
Ah the wait is no more
So they've gone with killing off Charmanders....great. I actually enjoyed his character and his story. Such wasted potential.
This feels surreal...to think this was the silly adventures of the Kanto starters is now something completely huge...
YOOOOOOOOO
😄
wow
No way he's actually back???? I never thought this day would come, completely forget this existed.
FINALLY! I'VE WAITED FOR SO LONG!!
The only thing I dislike about this series is that there are too little off it! JK, great job!!! 😁
@Shippage, when is episode 11 coming out?
Yoo what if in the next ep squirtle talks to the gods and then he convince them to bring back Charmander and maybe balbasour
Finally
I'm amazed Nintendo hasn't dropped a barbell from a helicopter directly on top of your computer yet
Holy crap! Ep 10?!
how many years has it been
I loved the episode!  But I’m sad about Charmander, I hope they can somehow bring him back…
Wtf. when will we get ep.11? I can't wait this long again. Give me next episode NOW!!!
Finally I thought It was never coming but it did nice
Don’t worry squirtle just get a max revive
but when you gonna do the next episode?
personally i still hate squirtle for what he did
It's been 5000 years...
CHARMANDER died noooooo
Aeeeeeeeeeeee
Man I’m gonna miss charmander I hope he some how comes back
Calling it now that on the next episode or in the last episode squirtle is ga man bring back charmander
WOOOOO my favorite Pokemon series is back
Wartortles voice sounds like batman
This series doesn't feel right without  Charmander
I am not joking when I say I waited years for this
Keep in mind this is the pokemon universe so deus ex revive on charmander is gonna work probably
1-2 years later...
yes
Wow squirtle evolved in the episode.
Miss charmander, I hope there's anyway to see him back 😄 Great job!!!
FINALLY!!
If that was Mt. Coronet, then Dialga and Palkia are probably involved in all of this. We saw the starters for the Sinnoh region which backs this up. If they are the gods on the mountaintop, then I guess it’s possible future episodes might involve time travel. The ten year gap certainly hit like Avengers Endgame.
I SO called Charmander's death.   Man this wait was worth it...!
I was realy hoping that charmander was alive. Now we'll never see him evolve. Unless he is reavivd.
FINALLY
LETS GO
Dude this series was so well written it outcompetes just about any special Pokémon episode of its kind and many series of its kind in both quality and storytelling. Holy crap your earned my sub and then some. I’m hyped for what’s next in the story!         (I have a theory. Since mewtwo told charmander to find him right after in cerulean cave maybe since he never showed up something happened and he was brought back. Idk just my theory. And the gods are trying to contain missingNo)
Finally
YES FINALLY ALL THE WAIT ITS HERE EP 10
Y’all really got me hyped again and now I gotta wait another year for episode 11 😭😭😭
You're doing awesome Shippidge! We'll be here until the end!
I thought this was just another 3d fan made pokemon video. It has been so many years, you finally finish it!
Yesssssssssss!
This is a ........... MASTERPIECE
I was hoping charmander was still alive.
Yes
I hope to see bulbasaur again, he was my favourite, and maybe he’d turn into ivysaur :)
Yay
Make more please
The tree guys were killing me, so supportive lol
I've never played or watched Pokemon before, but this series has had me completely hooked since I first found it two years ago, shortly after ep.9 released. Every once in a while I rewatch the whole thing and the jokes get me every single time, the entire story is just so PERFECT. Cannot wait to watch the last two episodes :D
This was amazing! Fantastic story telling and animation. 🤘😎
The missing nome?
RIP Charmander...
I think the obvious reason for Squirtle not wanting to evolve is cause Charmander wanted to evolve more than the rest of them. And Squirtle feels like he took that away from him when he got him killed.
Why did it take you so long to post isn’t there gonna be two episodes that are gonna be released are we gonna have to wait this long again ?
Probally next episode will result in 2023
hi
I sub to him for a week and he releases what you've all waited for forever, lol
Man charmander fucking died
It has been a long time
Woah, the story got an interesting shift!!!
What happen to bulbasaur
I been waiting for this for a long time
Holy cow I just rewatch the entire series
The best thing to watch
OMG THE 10 EPISODE
Welp this took a dark turn
This is some God of War shiz happening now
I think Dialga will send Wartortle back in time so he can save Charmander.
Is super fantastic i i donow Hau to say
22:57  The bloodborne boss when I bring the funny boom cannon
Absolutely amazing work I love the storytelling and such beautiful effects, I hope you are able to relax for a while and destress
that took a long time
Yessssssss finnaly EP 10
dont take years to make the next one
ready for 2024
When’s the next one
Flashbacks usually happen when someone is deep in thought but doing intentionally or at least recalling to happier times.
im so hype for this
Charmander... Something does not fit to me
Finally
It’s been 2 years but this was awesome CANT wait for the next part
OMG FINALLY
Hhiiiii
Why do you leave me on a cliffhanger
Ive waited soooo long
Wait is this the last episode
Squirtle the God of war
It was still good
I cant whait for the 2 more episodes left
YEEEEESSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG YEEEEEEESSSS
24 trending on gaming let’s goooo!
This portrayal of trauma is incredibly accurate.
I miss charmander and balbasuar and the first gen I thought it would just continue not 10 years later😐
First of all, *Claps and sobs* Second, This is gonna make a beautiful show Third, Pls make him see arceus Fourth, *Claps and sobs... louder*
When turtile is telling back story i really cry in that seen
What actually happened to Bulbasaur did he burn with those Caterpeis at the previous episode
What actually happened to Bulbasaur did he burn with those Caterpies at the previous episode
Finally episode 10
The time has my brothers and sisters we must rejoice over this a year of darkness has led to this
Anyone thought charmander would be alive?
This means that Charmander might be revived!  Fantastic episode!!!
I love to watch it 😍
Finaly
bro this was so good!
I’m saw a mewtwo in the forest with the caterpie and spearow
Amazing episode, can't wait to watch the next episode in the upcoming years
I realize that caterpie wore charmanders head like a hat i love that
Two more episodes to got. and another fantastic episode Shippidge and his crew, look forward for the final 2 episodes.
This was poggers

:O
Oh charmander died?, ofh that's horrible. Bulbasaur just left and is happy now.
I'm so excited
Ten million views
OMG FINALLY
BRO I LOOKED EVERY WEEK AND ITS HERE FUCK YEAH
For all the people who thought charmander was alive(including me)we have beenwrong,he has died without evolving
Lmaooo fuck that charmander, DESERVE  Turtwig was so right, and I’m glad Wartortle is coming to terms with his actions in the war. I didn’t expect the show to go this route but it was definitely a welcome switch up
This is great
Yooo, God of War Squirtle!!!
Yesssssd
Damn
Do you have a patreon and if so does that give me access to the high quality vids?
Rock blue
*applause*
SWAFGGGG
Charmander!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOoo
They say legends never die, but the Legend that returned is Shippiddge. In terms of quality, EVERYTHING with this series has improved and *Evolved.* The characters, Character Development, Music, Story, Lore, Conedy, and Messages. This was DEEP in the best way possible, and I am more than excited for what’s to come next, since this episode was MORE than worth the wait. Squirtle actually EVOLVING and pretty much going Super Saiyn. This was EPIC, and Is a monument of YouTube Web Series. (Charmander Dying might be one of the biggest Plot Twists in existence.)
Car honk
Make a starter squad of dbz team training
Pikachu
This was so cool
Lmao bluey
shame that Charmander died. he was my favourite of the original trio...
Bruh yes
12:51 good thing mewtwo is still fighting
Easy POG
big plot twist when charmander actually dies and what he says is true to be real i think charmander was gonna save the day until squirtle stopped him sealing his friends and everybody fates all because of a worm and a head wearing plant
Wuick
Free
10 year time jump, ain't too much of a big thing, because. Series started in 2013 right? It's 2021... 8 years ago.. I assume if they were doing this all in the span of one year Episode 1-9 It'd still be 2013. Crazy how time flies.
Yooo I was just thinking about this series yesterday!
I remember when I found you through the Sonic Logic Comics. Sad to see it can’t be found anywhere, but glad to see you’re still making content
Must have
Hdhavd
POKEMONBSYES
Was worth the wait
Among ia
Man after all this time episode 10 finally came out in so glad it finally did cause that was a wait worth waiting... But now it's no time for waiting it's the time for action and I think warturtle can agree... it's time to get back to work and make amazing videos Man I can't wait for more.
Omg happy
"IM A BIRD, TWEET TWEET"  "BIRD SOUNDS BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME, THEY DO"  "I AM SO MUCH OF A BIRD" R.I.P. Fearow, he was a true bird up until the end
Yeyeysyes
Ok ok let me get this straight Charmander died Squirtle depressed Bulbasaur can you give me answer to that one
Yeysyeys
Sponsorship
My childhood got to come back for a bit. Thanks man
Minecraft
I always thought snover was a little mountain...he's a tree?
Yeysyeys
Love the animation... soooooooo episode 11 is next Saturday right????
TOOK FOREVER!!!!
Chimchar sounds like the Dub voice for Luffy. AND HE’S A MONKEY! I hope this was intentional because I love it!!!
YESYESYEYSYEYSYES
R.I.P Charmander
Alright Shippidge see you in 5 years
I really love this episode with it’s dark turn on the story telling and the character development of Squirtle! Although this glosses over the obvious questions…    …HOW DID SQUIRTLE TRAVEL TO THE SINNOH REGION???? …where is Bulbasaur …Did Charmander turn into a Gastly? …Where is Piplup
A new chapter of Started squat right on my birthday fuck yeah!!
OH MY GOD OH MY FUCKIN GOD HE IS BACK PRAISE THE LORD
Well I guess we gotta wait another year for another episode
Where is charmander and bulbasaur?
Lowkey forgot this existed
I know this show somewhat damns the rules, but even with that being the case, I really can't see how Wartortle (even being level 99 and being as OP as he's portrayed) can literally stop Pokemon so powerful they don't even exist on earth. Like Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina are all on different planes of existence and that's not even taking Arceus into account.
About fucking time lmao
OMG!! My kids and I have waited 10 years and it was so worth it!!!! Awesome!!!!!!
Finally it’s here pog
It’s back after 4 or 5 years…
Squirtle's first line in the series: "That's a lie, he only knows Scratch"
me when charmander is dead
I WAITED A WHOLE YEAR AND ITS FINALLY OUT
The character development and storytelling has improved a touch since Smashtasm. Glad to see you still at it, Shipp
I can't believe it's finally here
Oh shit Squirtle has gone full on Charmander
*2 episodes left*
Ep.11
definitely worth the wait! cant wait to see more!
I have waited so long to see this.
Now for ep 11..................................................................
"Cold ppl are no match for hot ppl." I'll be using that line from now on
The end?
I can kind of see where this is going. Hopefully I'm right, and you didn't just outright abandon the original plotline.
I have checked ur channel for 2 years straight
Charmander fricking died didnt he ?
Was 2 - 3 years worth the wait I mean it was good but not worth the wait
Waiting for this was Avengers-level hype.
Chimchar is a parallel for Charmander.
A+ writing and twists, amazing series
cHARMANDER IS DEAD DFFGSDJF  Next Episode: Wartortle faces off with Mewtwo or sumn idk
Great addition to the series!
Ive been waiting for this
Its its just so beatiful finally the most anticipated part
Here before 1 million views
R.i.p char 2.0 ):
YOU TOOK A WHOLE YEAR BREAK DUDE
I miss charmander
I’m super curious about the maps used in this. Anyone know what they are?
The animation looks even better, I discovered these videos on tiktok 2 weeks ago and wao, this is amazing, congratulations people! You've done a wonderful story, can't wait to see what would happen later
People who have been waiting for this like
When is the 11 th so coming out
Finnaly slowbro
Hes in gen 4 now and in gen 4 theres a time god will he save charmander?
This gives me god of war vibes
This show is truly amazing please keep it up <3
2 years… I’m ready
Wee all had to wait but the wait was worth wartortle
Holly crap. That was so freaking cool. Can't wait for ep.11
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT  I cried while watching this

:D
ITS BACK THE GOD IS BACK
THE KING RETURNS HAZZZZZZZAH

What happend to bulbasuar
Waited so long! Thank you for this!!!!
i'm glad your still alive and posting videos-
Oh my god, I’ve been waiting 3 years for this ✨😄✨
6:49
as a great man once said,  LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This will take years of working
I’m so glad it’s finally released
Thank the Lord’s heaven it’s finally out I can’t believe it thank you Almighty YouTube or God
Man I've been waiting for years.
yes yes yes (jojo meme)
See y'all in 2 years lmaoo
Ok I’m gonna guess Wartortle meets Dialga Palkia and Arceus and travels back and defeats the Caterpie before Charmander dies. Because if not this series is weird
10/10. Best episode so far
OMG
I can't take it. You really killed charmander. You better revive him. I miss him already 😭
After an entire year it’s finally out bro!
ABOUT DAM TIME
I just realised there are 2 more episodes and I’m so excited to see the finally of this amazing series
Charmander would be proud
: )
Finally thank you
YYEEESSS!!! omg omg YEEEEEEEEE
YES FINALLY
Wait, did Wartortle activate Torrent? He was all glowy.
Abomasnow- “this word shall know pain”
IT RETURNS
One of the greatest things to ever exist
Wait a time skip
Thank u soooo much
What is with fire starters and having ideas above their station?
CHARMELEON.... 😢
its finally here.
episode 11, episode 11 !!!!
At last! This was worth the wait!
rewatching the series from then to now, and assuming there is more, are we supposed to be cheering for Squirtle?  Like as far as we know, HE caused all of this. Charmander would have been alive... if HE didn't stop him. He assisted in total destruction of an ecosystem under a crazed Caterpie and after it was said and done, the Caterpie realized this was a  waste of time and just... leaves, and Squirtle didn't kill him. Frost giant over here in the video blames his actions on some unreachable deities as Squirtle calls him out for it, yet Squirtle had his own choices to make (as he assisted in mass destruction and genocide) but its excused with a mental break as he was controlled by someone weaker than him. idk there has got to be more to those flashbacks
I've been watching this show since it first came out I was 7 I am currently 14 I don't have no idea what's going on I feel a difference between 9 and 10 and isn't that like two or three more episodes
28 MINUTES. YES.
Guys, it happened
This most certainly took a turn we all didn't expect. It makes me wonder what's gonna happen next, like, there are so many different directions this could go. One thing I wonder about is with Mewtwo and that unfinished plot point, if going to him could fix things. And then there's fact that this is Sinnoh and the mountain is likely Mount Coronet, which means Dialga is likely up there, the legendary pokemon known for controlling time. Maybe he'll be able to send Squirtle back to that moment when he fights Charmader in episode 9.
It suck that Charmander died he was best poke threw the series
YES EPISODE 10
Charmander is dead, we don't know what happened to bulbersaur, and squatile evolved... So technically it's not "starter squad anymore... Season 2 second evos incoming!!
“I think Bulbasaur got the happiest ending out of all of us” *Sees the absolute destruction that went down in Kanto* What happened to Bulbasaur?!
Im soo happy to see this  Thank you people who made this
Were balbsore
You killed charamader
Best content
FINAAALLLLYYYYYYYYY
Don’t read if you haven’t watched the video.      Holy moly, this was such a dark episode, squirtle‘s PTSD from the caterpillar army, charmander’s death, the forest turning into a burden. This was well worth the wait though! I absolutely love this series.
It’s here after the long wait
This chimchar has some nerve attacking bidoof
Its been 3 yrs and you have finished finally
It’s here
Squirtle: Vietnam War flashbacks.
Omg
Still got 2 more!
YESSSSS
22:58 Lol
Wow MonKE is a legend he almost beat several GODS
Yet another son goku legacy.
This  is a glorious occasion, ep10.
Can you revive charmander, because I hate this now, I want charmander and bulbasaur back.
Wait charmander is dead. More importantly SQUIRTLE EVOLVED
This was great. The story is progressing in a surprisingly bold way and the character development is well thought out and paced. I'm looking forward to the next episode. But I must ask you to PLEASE never use those high pitched flash back noises again. Anyone with mild tinnitus is going to have a very bad time after hearing something like that as I can attest.
See you guys in 2 years!!
Touch the Bidoof
They talked just like the digimon!
How to spot a dead body : There's an X where its eyes would be
I was legitimately not expecting this today, thank you
Im late 😶
There’s obviously a change in the story , charmander was not supposed to die, they where supposed to go meet mewtwo in cerulean cave
Are you going to post ep 11
Damn just get a max revive alr
I have been waiting so long man. This little series of yours is better than half of Netflix.
It’s the Pokémon starter squad.
I miss bulbasar!!!!
I kinda miss Charmander now
TELL THEM TO RETURN CHARMANDER AND BOBASOUR
10 episodes down. 2 more episodes to go.
OH GOD WE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS
This was a amazing episode and I waited 2 years for it
Holy shit it’s out
Time to wait another 3 years for another episode…  WORTH!!!!!!
Graciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssss Saludos desde Peruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu <3
Damn this story kinda saddens me  Chars dead  I was attached to him. He was cool.  Oh but I do love Turtwig  Squirtle really was wrong that he didnt help Char. I feel bad for how cruel his life has been  I really hate those caterpillars  I hope Turtwig and chimchar turn out alright. Still Char was right.,
*YEEESSSS*
Yes finally I waited so long for this.
wow
In one video it said that there is 3 episodes left ???
Modern art
I would’ve killed caterpie
i hope the pidgeotto is doing well
RIP charmander
:O yay i just saw this, its out
Finally
YAAAAAAY
Wartortle is gonna be the next son goku!
Rip charmander and bulbasaur I guess
EP 11
Finnaly the patience paid off
The king of the mountain has returned
After years it’s finally here
This episode = Shippiddge having a crisis. Reflective of the world today perhaps? We'll probably see an Empoleon wearing Bulbasaur's head next time and the main revelation is that Arceus isn't truly in control but Missingno. A god wanting to break the boundaries of "The Game" and make Pokemon do out of character things as that's what it desired all along. But it cannot say why it wants these actions or even how it's causing them, it's  just there among the pixels of the ones it absorbs. The Pokemon are doomed to a fate where they would go against what they were meant to be and destroy the worlds they know forever as a result, falsely believing in the hope that things can change and that they can change for the better............Or do they and does this hope actually exist? (Jirachi).
I really hope we don’t have to wait 2 years or more to see episode 11.
This was so amazing! The back story is amazing and the new story great job!
Dam was really good
ITS HERE I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT U FOR 3 YEAR OMG SHR  HIC EBIHEB HEB O
This was the best unexpected turn!
revive stone...

He’s finally here oh my gosh finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow would you look at that. Squirtle evolved into wartortle.
Dude all I'm saying is if he evolves to blastoise,I'll freak the fuck out
Dude you’re so slow uploading! i’ve been waiting years!
FINALLY!
ITS FINNALY HERE
this episode in a nutshell: squirtle has PTSD
I’ve been waiting for a long time, it’s worth the wait! Already 10 seconds in and I love it!
OMG IT TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT You are awesome Shippiddge I´m in love with your series!! Incredible job!! This is ... omg i need more words to describe the perfection of this...  AMAZING!
Everyone forgot about bulbasaur lol
Bra y killl charmander wtffff boooo he was the best thing bout of the series
FINALLLLYLYYYYYYY
Caterpie is quite fickle to squirtle
Wait…. WHERE IS BULBASAUR
11:30 wait isnt bulbasaur canonically a frog?
Well it’s confirmed. Charmander died. It’s a shame. If he managed to survive he might have actually learned a lesson.
Fun fact: chimchar is actually the next generation of charmander
Yeah
Character died trying to save squirtle. Damn.
I can’t believe charmander died
Bird!
Now I'm excited for Episode 11 and 12, and I can't believe Charmander is dead...
Let’s goo
Damn man been a while
😭 please use max revives on charmander, jk I want to see what happens next
Even from the first episode, Squirtle felt like the real protagonist of the story. 🥲Excellent job… the animation was superb, and this was show-length. I’m just blown away by the heart and dedication in this!
Took you long enough
I wonder if this series will start with reviving charmander and then they find mewtwo? maybe turtwig will come back
It doesn’t sit right with me that charmander is dead you should bring him back some how
After all these years
11 ep Eevee family
omg finally thank the lord
WHEN IS NEXT EPISODE COMING OUT.
Man... this episode made me sad... I sort of hoped Charmander would survive because I liked him.
FINALLY IT IS HERE
This was amazing it was definitely worth the wait
Thats where i discovered this, i was here 2 years ago. And now im wating years for 1 to come out. 2 More to go!
Nice episode. See ya in 2 years 👋
Chimchar could be stubborn. But on the other hand he is brave and become so ruthless like charmander.
LETS GOOOOO
YES THX GOD THE NEXT EP SI EXCITED
Hey did charmander have to die man
MY VOIE GOT CRACKED BC I SCREAMED SOOO BAD WHEN THIS WAS UPLOADED AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
YESSSSSSW FINALLY ITS OUT
FINALLYYYYY
It was great but I wish charmander and bulbasaur would return
About fuckinh time last ep i was still in high school 😭😭😭
It's been 3000 years...
This was amazing! An amazing episode, Shippiddge. I loved seeing Squirtle as an emotionally broken war veteran with a form of PTSD, the fact that Bulbasaur is still okay, the quick cameo of Mewtwo fighting MissingNo., and much more! I do not care how long the next episode takes, it will be worth it when Wartortle sees the Gods.
YRSSSSSSS
Can you make it where our manager turns into a Charizard
Good to have you back, Veggie Burger 😃😃😃
All Right Guys, see you in another 3 Years for Episode 11.👋🏻
I have a theory, that squirtle is going to make the Gods revive charmander
Finally. 10 episode has finally come. Congratulations 👏 because this episode i think was the best episode
I Hope Episode 11 comes out soon I really like the Episodes.
22:58
Sweet! I was hoping that Charmander was actually killed off and it wasn't a false twist/cliffhanger! Stories nowadays are often so safe and by-the-books that we don't get fun writing like that, and I am very happy to see it continue on with Squirtle! The time-jump was unexpected, but I really liked this episode! Great job and keep it up! You're doin' a fantastic job  EDIT: I like Charmander. I was hoping that he was killed because that would be a very serious place to take the story and it wouldn't have falsely played with my emotions. It was devastating seeing the Charmander hat, as silly as the X eyes are
Been here since EP 3 thank you for all the memories!
Wow
there is no such thing as beaver society, but there is a thing called bidoof society :)
This is like the worst day of all time and the best day of all time at the same time.  I get to watch a new starter squad, but I'm also realizing that I'm gonna have to wait another half decade for another one.  I'm probably gonna be in my 40s by the time this series ends lol.
😯 10/10
The legend has returned here's your crown 👑
Let’s go episode 10
The wait was worth it
So what happened with the whole Mewtwo thing? Squirtle never went to Cerulean Cave?
its finally here!
Oh my gosh it finally happening!! Everyone shut up Please shut up EVERYONE SHUT THE _____ UP!! IT FINALLY HAPPENING!!!
I want 11
Time to wait another year for an episode...
Alright see yall next year
Thank you so much for bring use your newest chapter!!  It was very Good. 👍 can't wait to see where the story goes
Anime house 5 and starter squad in one day, it must be heaven
I waited too long for you to upload the ep 10  And also your video is good
THAT WAS AWESOME!.......See y'all in 3 years XD
I hope piplup will appear in the episode
17:54 "you can tell because there are x's in his eyes" had a good laugh at this lmao
OH MY GOD ITS OUT
Literally just watched the series over again last night hoping that it would continue soon. What kind of sorcery is this
Years,decades,century’s,Milleniums
The wait was worth it!
wow i did not expect this
Finally
15:52 Im not afraid of you! Thats my purse!
This video teke so longer):|
Am I the only 1 that wanted charmander 2 evolve and carry on in the series till he got 2 charizard
That moment when you realize Missingno is still out there.
"Im a BIRD! TWEET! TWEET!" is the best line in the episode🤣🤣🤣
I HAVE BEEN WATING FOR THIS
Did bulbasaur and charmander die
I think you mentioned turtwig not blubasaur. Squirtle you nincompoop.
It took you a year and months to make a Test episode finally is here thank you
Been a fan for years, cant lie tho, this is not what i fell i love with, cant even finish watching
Am so sad now, but this is amazing as always! Love Squirtle to death and hope there's some miraculous comeback with Charmander, cause Squirtle really needs someone who cares about him as he endures all this pain and hardship
Holy sh i almost forgot the existance of this
You should have let Mewtwo save Charmander
Noooo not Whiskers D:
Spoilers:                             Squirtle and Wartortle had to have damaged the voice! But man, that was epic!
It’s about time, this should be like a holiday since these only come out about once a year
I miss charmender
I bet bulbasour will have evolved next time they meet
Charmander may be dead but I still have hope he returns even though he is probably dead
Finally it took so long
when will Pikachu be in the series?
FINALLY I have been waiting for so long
Omgg
As the legend foretold he came back!!!
finally
If charmander is dead does that mean he is a gastly
My days of waiting are over. He is back
I was expecting to have a laugh trip But in the end Im left in tears. This was super enjoyable but depressing asf especially Squirtle's backstory, he's my 2nd fave starter and seeing him holding the corpse of my Favorite starter in general just hits me way too close to home
Yo its out
Lets go it finally came out
alright everyone we just got a few more years for the next one we can wait
Punished Squirtle
Worth the wait indeed!!! (Don't want to say too much.)
I hope charmander and bulbasaur come back it wouldn’t be the same without them
26:06 why is there a comma
All Wartortle has to do is use a full revive on Charmander and chimchar
I'm excited for the next episode
This new style is bad I thought that was a monkey
Charmander should've lived...
When the world needed him the most he returned
I never realized that abomasnow could be so cool.
IT'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ve been loyal for so long, and here it is
This was amazing
YOU MADE  THEM KILLED CHARMANDER HOW COULD YOUUUUUU 😭
Bruh it’s been so fricken long!
Somehow, this reminds me of the story 'The 🐒 and the (2) 🐢'
I love this series
wow, seems like evolving DOES make an difference to your strength...
YESSS FINALLY I HAVE WIATED SO LONG FOR THIS
Finaly
Finally!! Over all these years, it's finally here!
I lost my shit when I heard DawnSomewhere's voice!
I have waited for so long for episode10 I’m so happy
Ohhhhh myyyyy gooooshhh
Wow episode 10 came out  but wait what happened to Bulbasaur and Charmander
That was epic I hate how charmander died tho :/
Was patiently waiting and now its hereeeeee 😭
Wow, this was crazy! Amazing episode! I can’t wait for the next one!
Time to wait till 2024
To bar for Charmander and chimchar they both died and were my favorite starters but atleast the show was pretty damn good
I thought charmander would return but I realized he was dead
Let'ssssssssss ggggooooooooooo it been 87 years
It's been so long
cliff hanger  ;(
OH MY GOD
10 bucks says that squirtle is gonna meet a celebi to turn back time
Been waiting forever for this
You've somehow made waiting for years completely worth it. Not just in story but animation on top.
YES, THE WAIT IS OVER!!
Wait, but what happens with mewtwo and all that?
Where’s bulbasaur
Finally
Woo-how it’s finally out!
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!!
FINALLY
FINALLY!!!!!!
no NO CAR DIED HE WAS MY FAV NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Squirtles in gen 4 now, he's gonna get dialga to go back in time and save charmander
The ultimate weekend hype
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR A PART TEN TO COME OUT AND IT HAS TO COME OUT ON 2021!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
This wound up being super emotional damn, squirtle's character growth actually had tears welling up when he evolved
Best day of my life. Well worth the wait. great job as always.
Wait. How did Misngno not KILL Squirtle in 10 years???  What happened to Mewtwo chasing him?? Gahh!! Questions that need answers!!  12:51 wait, missed it! Yeah so locked in epic duel to end of time, got it.
At around 14:30 one of the Snover gets replaced while they say "Truly, our friends are the most replaceable people we know."
I can't believe they did my dude dirty 🥺 and then the story telling is amazing.
Finally ep 10 I been waiting for 2 or 1 years finally
Dam... Ship edge beat Sam o Nella
i get the feeling youre gonna make wartortle see Arceus dialga and palkia and then they take him back in time to save Charmander and then they live their childhood happily ever after, after they see mewtwo and defeat the missingno.
Nooooo Bring Charmander back he was my favourite character!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
No wonder he’s a slow poke
This was Great! Can't wait for episode 11!
jesus I was like when is the next one coming out like 2 days ago
The wait omg finally
WAIT HO- I WA- HGUAUUGH. IM NOT PREPAR- I WAS EXPEMTIN- LIKE A MONTH- HGKUAYGKAUYFUM
Ed Atlins voice caught me off guard
and now we have to wait another year
FINALLY
He’s back! When I first saw this I was 8!
It took a year but finally out and it kicked so hard
I was not expecting to be this engaged in the emotional narrative of this story, but here I am shaking from Squirtle overcoming his self-imposed boundaries after 10 episodes.  Edit: In ~ 25 minutes, you justifiably concluded Charmander's narrative and turned Squirtle into the main character without fail. That's God Tier writing chops.
Yaaaaaaaassssss queen! So Fucking Long I have been waiting for this!
Wait did I see mew two a-taking a sorrow
So Charmander actually did die.. I expected him to survive or block the stick but will we see him as a ghastly? I cant wait for the next two episodes!
This is what a masterpiece is
God I missed this
God Of Wartortle?
HOLY SHIT!!!! CHARMANDER'S ACTUALLY DEAD!!! wow did not expect that. Just wow.
IT'S HERE. The time has come, comrades. We must rejoice!
I've been waiting for so long
The finale I’m imagining is squirtle now being and Blastoise and fighting Arceus
I hope that Charmander will come back somehow.
6:09
“Oh cool, what are you gonna ask?”   ……. “Something…..”
Charmander was my favorite character, but now, due to the amazing backstory and character development that Squirtle has, this series has become a lot interesting. Squirtle (or should I say Wartortle) is so badass. Looking forward to a new episode!
When will episode 11 come out?!
8:19 Bulbasaur did say "this is my life now".  It'll be interesting to see what happened to Caterpie after all of that. Knowing how the world works and Caterpie's way of fighting, they're probably dead.
13:52 creo que es una referencia a los 3 años que tardaron en hacer eso fueron 2 pero ya casi eran 3
Please hire some help so that you can finish this series in my lifetime
YESSSSSSS
The wait is over
This was absolutely the best one yet, so much lore, Jesus Christ this is fucking amazing.
YESSSSS
Yooooooo it’s out
Missing no is still out loose. Can’t wait to see what happens next
Finally it's been 3 years or more
Need that Soundtrack upload!!
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
So Charmander is death... this is depressing. great video you can see that you really tried hard
hall ya, it's finily here
Hype
Holy shit
All this time I thought caterpie was wearing a hard hat......DAMN LOL
Wow this was amazing.....can't wait years episode😄
2:32 SO LONG GAY BOWSER
Well, I guess I'll see you guys in 3 years lmao
That was awesome well can't wait for ep11 next 10 years
Omg bro finally this series is back!
So charmanders actually dead.
YESSS FINALLY THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT
Can we just talk about this man’s dedication? 10 years! 10 years! Goddamn.
RIP charmander
Finally the wait of 2 years is over but please don't do that again.
I’m liking the trend of the increasing length of each episode. I’m prepared to wait 3 years for episode 11 as well.
Now we gotta wait for ep 11
Glad this went in a darker direction. It had a unique message after starting off as a silly satire. I also love the meta critique of "following orders" used in the series that has been foreshadowed at the beginning.  Fun stuff! Hope this inspires original pieces of work with a strong message! Great work, and thanks for taking your time with this.
7:57 WHAT THE FUCK
Question did it take 1 year to complete the rest of the episodes or 1 episode
I AM SO HAPPY YOU MADE THIS . EEEEEEK! I LOVE YOU! THIS WAS AN AMAZING VIDEO!
Finally
Finally I’ve been waiting for this for 3 years
12:45 the world is falling apart mewtwo was fighting [I forgot name of Pokémon]
So happy to see this come back!
The legend returned
I want a pikachu cameo
This definitely wasn’t what I was expecting! This series just keeps taking unpredictable turns.  I love the most slightest detail for Squirtle, his eye bags. It just shows how out of it he is and how stuck he is on seeing Chimchar and Turtwig as Charmander and Bulbasaur
YES I love this series
Yoooooooooo it’s finally here! The wait was so totally worth it!
This is the best series I’ve watched
12:51 I know one is mewtwo what is the other one , missingo? 🤔🤔🤔
OMG IS HERE
Ah yes, A great episode. Now the 2 year wait begins for the next episode. I don't mind, I've had patience through out this whole thing. it'll be worth it.
YAYYYYY
When the world needed him most… Shippiddge returned. And returned he did… With a bang.
8:58 "if you look at the sun it will give you super powers"
Yeeeesssss I’ve been waiting for this and it was very good
I miss Chrmander....
Shoot. Thats One Hell of a Bomb to drop..I was one of them thinking Squirtle Would Some how Save Charmander..But. Dam. Still an Awesom Series though!
Yes finally
Let's go I've been waiting for this for over a year
Finally
It’s back or is this the end I hope it’s not
Omg
Nooooo Charmander!!
At long last, the wait is finally over…
Bring back charmander
Ive been waiting for over 2 years for charmander to die.. breh
Finally...after so long our favourite trio is finally back. Time to see how Charmander is handling things after that ciffhanger. (Watches Episode 10) ...Well, that was certainly depressing and emotional on many levels. Um...I wasn't expecting this kind of continuation. RIP Lizard.
ITS FINALLY HERE
IM EARLY AHAHAHA
So this is gonna be Pokemon god of war
Ayooo
I really just thought Caterpie had a new beanie to wear then i just see the X’s on the back… my heart DROPPED
Plot twist charmander is still alive and that was a fake
RIP charmander. 😞✊
E
On episode 9 when charmander bulbasaur and sandshrew  walked down the Tunnel with drawing of dead charmanders their was a drawing I saw where charmander was getting Stabbed by caterpie. and squirtle was looking at a wartortle running Too them and episode 10 squirtle Evolved to wartortle and theirs a God Pokémon  On the mountain
YOOOOO
OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS OUT!!!!
This brings up old nostalgia
Maybe wartole is gonna ask for charmander back
Yes finally I love ur other episodes this is great!
No charmander
If pokemon die when defeated what do revives do in this universe?
Honestly killing Charmander and shifting to Squirtle was actually pretty cool. I also like how Mewtwo was still fighting off Missingno was a nice touch since the kanto starters never got to meet up with him at Cerulean Cave. Something tells me wartortle is gonna be talking to Dialga though
Well imma guess that god is DIalga and he's gonna send him back in time to save his friends.
21:26 Epic moment
the wait is finally over !
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
That was good but all I could think about was the fact that I'm gonna have to wait another 2 years for ep 11 I'm 13 years old when ep 11 comes out I will be  15
rip charmander i miss you
YESSS IT’S HERE
Thank you
Wait was  so long i need a recap
I think charmander is coming back
finally
But charmander
What about mewtwo and cerulean cave?  This is not an okay timeskip. Regardless, great work.
Finally
Charmander NOOOOOOO! He was my favourite.. (sob)
God of War Squirtle
Finally waiting over booss
Now you got to make another one tomorrow
Charmender…..
After 10,000 years…I have you…
OMG ITS HERE thank you so much for making this
YESS
Huh I didn’t expect for charmander to actually die
Damn, this was incredible! Squirtles going full Kratos now!
OH JESUS He's actually dead
No way it finally came out
I hope chimchar never dies
I just realized that Charmander is now a Gastly now since he's dead. I wonder how he's doing
I love the Snovers here. This was one hell of an episode, and I can't wait for the rest.
Yes episode 10
Does anyone else hate that Charmander is dead
This was an amazing experience.   And I gotta say, Squirtle going the Kratos route was not expected.
Squirtle was at Level 98, he pressumably evolved to Wartortle at level 99, so it's safe to assume that he'll become Blastoise at the climax of this series. I love this buildup.
who knew this edgy pokemon series evolved from 'no i dont wanna be caught' to 'vietnam flashbacks'
chimchar is goated
Yayy
YEZZZ POGGER also now only 2 episodes left!!!!
YESSSSS THANK YOU SO MUCH
I like how chimchar has something against societies
Omg omg omg!! It's finally here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 time to binge watch all episodes again 🔥
And what happened to bulbasaur??
N O T B I D O O F F F F
The storyline is everything in this series it’s amazing
Huh
hat happend to charzard
Did anyone else spot mewtwo at 12:48
Pog
At last, after 2 years, we finally have episode 10!!! Good job for all your hard work, Shippidge!
It’s amazing how squirtle’s want to be on a team and take orders was shown as early as episodes 5 and 7, and these flashbacks show us the extreme of what that extreme loyalty he wanted got him: the dangers of following orders blindly.
After TWO FREAKING YEARS WE GET ANOTHER EPISODE!
Omg omg omg omg
It took two years to make this????
Charmander died R.I.P. Then again he DID do that to himself
Make him go back in time and Charmander evolve and kills the leader
I done waiting 😭
This couldnt have been a better birthday for me so far
Did no one else see Mewtwo fighting Missing No. ? I think that'll come back at some point
This episode was all around great
Cool animotion only its sad that squirtle couldn't save chimchar from death like charmander.
I feel sad on how long it took me to notice the hat ...
That was a huge left turn. Im not sure how to feel about this episode...
This was definitely the 2 year wait, Thank you too all who have contributed to this part of my childhood :)
BEST EPISODE EVVVVEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Something.” To be continued...
Finnaly
Wow it's finally here and it's gonna be awesome 👌
squrtile is like charmander now
This is the only episode that doesn’t have charmander in the thumbnail
Wait a new episode *pogface *
"You're just using us to relive your stupid childhood"  Oh my god. Squirtle's a boomer now.
I'm so glad you're back! I was worried the series would end on a cliffhanger
This was INCREDIBLY heavy to watch but epic as hell. Can't wait... well I gotta wait for the next one 🤣
Bulb
Finally after waiting for 1 year...
Its way way way tooo cool! Great storytelling, such a great improvement specially in the 3D animation.. thank you for creating this
Dafuk ? Hope charmander isnt dead
OMG YESSS FINALLY
FINALLY ITS BACK!!!
What the fu-
Squirtle has been my fav pokemon ever since it was out, I really love him :D
Legendary Series.  Keep up the good work Shippidge and the team!
Finally it’s here
i can't believe charmander died, it was kinda a shocking twist, i thought he wouldn't die because he was so stubborn, yet here he is, defeated by bug types. poor charmander
I haven’t even watched it and I know it’s amazing. Thank you for all your hard work on these!
That was awesome! But now we have to wait a long time for the next episode...
Thank you :)
HOLY SHIT ITS HAPPENING
Boom
If he said there are only few episodes he is starting fillers and seasons I am sure
Noooooooo Charmander was my favorite! Or was it bulbasaur? Anyway, I loved this episode. It actually seems like it belongs in an anime.
Warturtle solos goku it’s confirmed🤣
Ep 11 in 2 years PogCrazy
YESS ITS FINALLY OUT
I'm impressed you find that that lady now you're making more
Damn I didn’t expect that
With this being sinoh, Arceus dialga palkia and possibly giratina are all up there meaning he could even go back in time
I can't believe charmander died
From escaping the world's most incompetent trainer to facing god to change his fate, this series really took a turn for the awesome
OMG YESS
Finally after 2 years
the story has taken such a wild and interesting turn, like a bad future. Its great
Finally the backstory no more waiting c!
They really killed Charmander for character development, wow
Finally
This was an amazing episode, Squirtle was popping off at the end you did an astounding job with the flashbacks
F I N N A L Y
everybody was like: "missigno will probably appear in the next episode!"  missigno appearing for 1 second in the whole video: "My (appearence) was, greatly exagerated"
my guess on episode 11: squirtle meets arcues, and finds out it is corrupted by missingno. the mountain that squirtle is climbing is mt. coronet.
ITS HAPPENING HOLY SHIT ITS HAPPENING
Now we have to wait for episode 11 and I miss this and I hope you do more videos soon.
Yes...                                   Wait what happens next                                                    WAIT WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO OR EVEN THREE AGAIN!?!?!
Worth the motherfuckin wait!
Those little white tree things are hilarious!
OMG WHAT IT RELEASED DIS YEAR HOWWWWW
After all these years
Omg finally
ES GETE
The wait was worth it
RIP charmander
Wooooo ep 10 nows lets wait 2 more years
Its great but im sad that charmander died because i loved his Care free attitude
Absolutely loved everything about this.
HOLY SHIT
Spoilers and theory for those who haven't finished the episode yet and just went straight to comments    Honestly sad to see Charmander dead he had so much character development at the end I really like the idea of a 10 year time skip with new starters.  Now a theory I have for this is Charmander is going to come back alive with Dialga's time power especially since this is set in gen 4. We even saw Mewtwo fighting MissingNo at 12:50 so maybe Mewtwo will help in the fight against Arceus
ples add more Ep of Pokemon
Now this will satisfy us for another 2 years, see you all in 2023
YESSSS IM SO HAPPY ANOTHER ONE CAME OUT
YES
yeeeeeeeeee coool
Anybody else see Mewtwo fighting missingo
Make more
What happened to Charmander
Wait are you making more
Squirtle is the Pokémon for of depression
I'm so so glad this ep came out thx
So let me get this straight Squirtle lived and fought with the Caterpie only to destroy the entire forest and Charmander's actually dead what about Bulbasaur?
Totally didnt see this coming, amazing story-telling and worth the wait
coool
Huh...so charmanders just... Dead... Dang
finnaly
ITS BACK
FINNALY
Turtwig's description is so accurate
whys noone talkin bout mewtwo fighting missingno in the forest?
YAY EP 10 IS FINALLY HERE
what’s that song at 27:06 ngl it slaps
ep 11.
Man, he became metal as fuck xD  Loved it, definitely worth the wait, cant wait for the next ep
An amazing story
I need to see Bulbasaur again...charmander died sooo
Charmander is dead….. such a waste if character progression he probably a gastly now….. Bulbasaur is probably caterpie food and now squirtle is a broken and replacing his old tram with 2 others…. I miss  charmander
my realest question is wtf happened? this escalated so quickly what the hell happened in this war? Nothing in VIridian forest is that god damn powerful. Like they burned it to the ground and no fire type is that powerful. Did they get Moltres to do this?
Yes
I do not hate chimchar anymore i oficially hate squirtle
Heree!!! before this will get viral! <333
I was waiting the entire series to see charmander again but he's dead now
Ahh yes ginally
its been 1000 years
Still can't believe Squirtle let them kill Charmander 😪
Sheesh let’s go the wait was so worth it
The funny thing is… This isn’t even his final form.
Squirtle evolved and went through Pokemon puberty 😂
Dude I got so hyped when I found this episode !!!!
IT'S FINALLY HERE
Pog
Dude post more  Please
Omg u back I can finally find out the end 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
It's only been 2 years so we didn't wait THAT long right?
Valió la pena tanta espera
I'm hoping that Wartortle battles dialga and he finally evolves into a Blastoise but on episode 11 if not the last episode ❤️
Beo squrtle went super sayin god sage mode bruh
Holy cow. The God Of Turtle has begun
Please make God a Magikarp I need this
And now we wait another year! It will pain me.
Episode 1: Hehe, funny Starters are self conscious against their trainers Episode 10: Squirtle is depressed, Charmander’s head got cut off, and Bulbasaur is a masochist
This was completely worth it
I was thinking about this like, 2 days ago lmao.
What the hell just happened /pos
When french commentary please?
ITS OUT... ITS FINNALLY OUT! im SHAKING AND QUIVERING
“Because of friendship reasons” 😂
Bro...... This was totally worth the 2 year wait
Yyyaaasss
Damn bro this hit hard
How did charmander die?
Finally 😁
So it went from starter squad to solo god
Finally I’ve been waiting for years
I HATE CHIMCHAR TOO
I know I’ll get some hate but I honestly don’t really like this conclusion I was excited to see charmander make amends with squirrel and too see there ventures go forth only for charmander to be dead and squirtel a husk of himself
Fuck they killed Charmander!
At this point Squirtle (Now Wartortle) is gonna evolve into Blastoise at some point
Bro what if Charmander/Charizard is the God Of Pokemon! And he left a dead Charmander so he could run away.
Episode 11 release
That was worth the wait💙🐢
Hi
Yay!!! now I have to wait another year for ep 11!!!!
IM SO GLAD ITS BACK THIS WAS AMAZING. HE FINALLY LET GO OF THE RAGE!!!!!
this is awesome 😁
finally after so long
My gosh
Finally EPISODE 10 AFTER WHAT FELT LIKE 6 YEARS!
10/10
Beautiful
When we needed him most, he returned.
8 yeat ago first one bruh the so long my guy 11 going to be 2 year
So..... Did we choose charmander to die?
Every episode is very good
i FU**ING HATE CHIM CHAR
this just made my day ❤️
Why was this so good if there are only two videos left there should be a season 2
Finally!
Me: “searches Pokémon on YouTube”    Me when I see this:                 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTYYYTTTTTTT ISBAOHPAHOAVOGFIHSIHSOHWIBIDBODNSOBSIBSOWNOOWNO
I thought you wouldn’t even release episode and 10 finally the wait is over 😃😃😄
ITS BACK! THE HIATUS IS OVER
Sooo... I'm guessing we're done with the whole Missingno. thing for now? Cool, no sarcasm.
HOW DID SQUIRTLE SNAP OUT OF IT?!
Finelllllllllllyyyyy you post
Why just why did you do
Pin me please for charmander
8 years for this ... Idk I feel underwhelmed but at least we got something.....
That episode we all have been waiting for
FINNALLY!!!
yassss finally
Definitely been waiting for this! Great job 👍
Omg great video 🤩. My only nitpick is that I think wartortles voice is too deep and doesn’t match but other then that amazing
Can't wait for the final bet it got to be epic
so Charmander is actually dead huh? but now we get to see it all go down on Wartortle's side... awesome it feels like this whole time the story was about him instead of Charmander. i mean Charmander started all this insanity, but Squirtle was the one trying to keep things in order, now that he lost everything and seen so much shit.. now he is just as mad as Charmander was.  let's see how it all goes down in the end.
Holy crap, an episode. That must mean it's a holiday
e
Me when waiting: .... HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?!?!(madagascar movie reference) Me finally seeing this episode: huh well Dat explains a coupla things wonder when the next episode is released.
I do not regret being a patron for 90% of this videos production :)
This series has really evolved.
MAKOA?! Oh man paladins x Pokémon.
Team Snover
Shiii--- this is just god tier quality 🔥
Everyone wanted that charmander lived in the poll why
Yessss
Finally
Holy shit Charmander actually fucking die XDXDXDXD
Not the direction I expected this series to take but definitely a worthwhile one.
Damn… So dramatic and sooooo epic at the end. Holy sht. Please more!
YOO i'm so glad i waited :D
Finally episode 10  of the starter squad how long has it been like a year finally
Yes finally
I going to just say he will ask dialga travel back in time to save charmander
O.M.G Iam waiting for this moment
That sad that Charmander die wait a minute he's not going to do what I think he goes to do is he going to revive Charmander and chimchar that will be awesome if that happen I think Charmander and chimchar well be best friends
FINALLY
I don’t know how it took him over 10 years for him to evolve, but i’ll take it
YOO ITS FINALLY HERE
No more Charmander😭😭😭
Damn, my man squirtle Just made me almost cry with his backstory, you outdid yourself, fantastic job
It was worth the wait
12:51 is squirt hallucinating or its just mewtwo correcting time and space
I miss charmander. Honestly the animation and stuff was pretty good but it kinda lost its charm
Charmander esta muerto!? Yo esperaba que algo pasara al final del capitulo 9, como que Charmander hubiera evolucionado a último momento o hubiera escapado y luego regresaría evolucionado con sed de venganza, por lo que squirel tendría una batalla final épica, la verdad no se como sentirme con este episodio... Después de todo yo seguía a charmander no a la tortuga azul y al pinché gusano
Wow. Just wow
After 1 year. It’s finally here!
I dont know what to feel towards this....it was such a rolercoaster, cause I cant say Charmander way to do things was right yet, Squirtle by far made the worst choices among them, hope to see the next chapter soon....
Rip Charmander Tho
also what did squirtle do to lenard? 13:29
Squirtle becomes Blastoise. Then in the last fight against Arceus when he still needs more power, he access Mega Evolution and goes Ultra Instinct on Arceus's ass. Calling it now.
Big B is so wise I just realized caterpie is wearing charmander head Also could somebody give the theme when squirtel evolves ? Also the ending theme
Dude i just saw this i didnt even notice the teaser
wtf level 98 and unevolved ?  Bruh the hell.
I’ve waited a long time for this.
It was Awesome! No, it IS AWESOME!
No way this fianly csme
1 year later episode 10
Yay now time to wait for the next one in  700000 months power nap time 😴
Am I the only person who binge watched this whole series everytime a new episode drops? I love this
omg yes a new episode!! worth the wait :)
Loved it like always
eyyy finally
FINALLLYYYYYYY!!!! AFTER YEARS FINALLY ITS HEAR 😭😭 Edit: it felt like years
Good stuff the suspense got me to infect 7 people to watch it
I WAS HERE
Most interesting out of all of them.
:)
Ngl, I dont wanna see a episode without the old squad - Charmander, Bulbsaur and Squirtle. Im hopin for a return ;(
I srsly thought charmander would live… i mean- like..
ITS HERE ITS FINALLY HERE:D
Thank you so much I love this series
Absolutely beautiful. This series changed so much, and only for the better.
CATERPIE YOU PSYCHO
This was FIRE
Keep it up
12:51 I see Mewtwo is still fighting Missingno.
This episode was awesome 👌 can't wait until episode 11 to come out
YEAAAH, ITS FINALY THE 9TH CHAPTER!
Just a theory...we will either find charmander in distortion world or with arceus or with the glitch or with the haunted...
I really love your videos pleassss make another one
Now to wait two more years for episode 11.
I wonder what happened to bulbasaur and how did he die
Everyone misses charmander. Wonder what happend to bulbasaur
👍🏼👍🏼
It might sound weird but I don't think Charmander is dead, the reason I say this is because he still has to meet up with Mewtwo, plus there are revives.
Dude this fucking sucks. I’m angry as hell because it doesn’t even continue the story and none of the characters but squirrel is in the story. I cant believe I waited so many years for this bullshit. I’m just unsubbing.
finallllyyy
I can't believe how it turned out
Finally episode ten !!!!
I cant believe a caterpie plays a role of a strong guy and im so annoyed, now I always go to viridian forest and use flamethrower using my lvl.100 Charazard. I find it wasteful but satisfying.
Oh
omg
What a shit of episode bro…. Really?!?
YES! HE’S BACK!!!
Squirtle just became kratos with his dead chimchar😂 Guess he is gonna use it as the blades of chaos
Dude, what a ride, i loved the emotional approach, can’t wait for the next episode. My man Squirt… I mean Wartortle getting the respect he deserves.
Now we wait another year for episode 11. Jfc that was worth the wait though. Brilliant!
why did charmander have to die?
Only two left can't wait to see ware this goes
👍
Holly shit! I honestly thought this was a dead project! I'm so glad I never unsubed. This is so amazing 💗
I see what wartortle is called wartortle
"A true friend doesn't care if he's actually your friend. Some of my closest friends in the world have been my greatest enemies, and I've never even talk to them."
i think squirtle evolves in this episode because i remember the leak
I’ve waited 2 years for this            That to be continued hit different
Greatest comeback ever since endgame.
Holy crap, this was awesome! Seeing Squirtle's development over these years really made this a stand out moment! Was not expecting the story to take such a dark turn with Caterpie and Squirtle losing everything.
OMGGG ITS HERE
I've been waiting for this thanks!!
Yesssssssssss
Worth the wait
caterpie leader is wearing charmanders head
FINALLY ITS HERE THANK YOU DUDE EVERYONES BEEN WAITING
Are we gonna wait for another year now
Well I gotta say the whate was worth it sad that old team fell apart same as the new but a I enjoyed it
this squirtle isnt evolve to wartortle but it just evolve into mega blastoise
Jesus squirtel just became the legendary war turtle
So Charmanders gone?
Honestly not bad for a 2 year wait
Maybe it's Charmander at the top but he evolved in to a charzard it's my theory
my heart leaped out my chest when i saw this
Where’s Bulbasaur and Charmander?
The legend is back
OH MY GOD OH MY FKING GOD ITS ACTUALLY JAPPENING
12:51 THEY STILL FIGHTING EVEN AFTER ALL THEESE YEARS!? DAMMMMMMMMMMN
I do hope there is a Alternate episode where they safe charmender from the past
When ep 11
This is my most waited series to comeback! Now Digimon Tri Abridged is left
WAIT WHAT HAPPENED TO BULBASAUR?!?!
Oh my gosh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After years… it’s out…
I enjoyed this! I wonder what happens next. Let’s get him to 1 Million!
I KNEW CHARMANDER WAS DED
Not gonna lie.. you had us waiting for years on end. For another episode. At that point we thought you’d given up. But then you gave us this with an even more solid story with the suspense and drama. Now all you did by the end is get me hyped up for the D&P reboot!
Welp, see you guys again in 2 years
After years I’ve been waiting for this :)
Google or Charmander came alive and the shortest back for the next one
I remember watching his series years ago with my brother and the animation got better
Wow this is better than actually television.

It one year
i can fly
I hate this where is Charmander and Bulbasaur
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I've been waiting for this and your hard work paid off thus story is good
Too bad he’ll never be a Blastoise.
Finally it's here God I waited many years for this and it's finally here thank you hope the other two more episodes they make doesn't take many years
Yay you actually told the truth I mean you have no reason to lie in the first place. I actually thought charmander would come back during the fight but it turns out he didn't so was it even worth the wait? But nice song at the end and I know squirrel was going to jump on the icicles and yeah bibby is right getting loved is important but not as important than loving yourself. Plus, I thoughthought chimchar was going to say to bibby that it hasn't got him anywhere.
This took almost 3 years i cant wait another 3 years for part 11
The
This came out on my birthday, the best not-for-me birthday gift ever
Wait what, in the poll Charmander won to stay alive I'm so confused
I thought it was a lie
This is really good I hope char Char stays alive and evolves!
Hopefully we see flash back of charmanders death with Wartortle while he takes Chimchar up ok this a Theory he find the pokemon God obviously has to be Arceus hopefully it isn't did they Pokemon God but watch it Bulbasaur affair just kidding who knows I think he's either get a wish or something to have to charge come back alive and Charmander who knows people have that can either ask the gods to take him back in time and change history I still want to know about that description world I think they have hontoon yet if I'm right and one of those unknown Pokemon
I'm looking forward for episode 11 and 12
I hate his
I still want to know what happened to sandshrew
Bueno a esperar 3 años más por el otro episodio
12:51
charmander will come back in episode 11 or 12
Amazing episode.

FINALLY ITS OUT
Why did Charizard have to die
Its here.
Omg
Poor charmander
Even though Charmander didn't make it, it's good to see that Squirtle carried the best aspects of both of them forward. Can't wait to see how he wraps up the dimensional instability plot.
Noooooo my boy mander
Is it just me or am I getting god of war vibes from this episode?  Squirtle= Kratos Let’s goo
...well i mean Holy Shit  This was more than worth the wait, I feel like I've been blessed

Huh
I've been playing pokemon for well over a decade and never realized that Turtig was a turtle. 😐 I just never noticed. Wtf.

Sucks that charmander is actually dead but finally episode 10 I loved it
Over a year of waiting Finally a continuation

I have been waiting for this moment
Holy hell that was amazing. I didn't think it could get any better, but here it is! And 25 minutes? I was expecting a 5-10 min short, but a half-hour long epic is something YouTube needs a lot more of. Amazing job man!
Been 3 years but the legend has returned
Wait so charmander died...... Like DIED died........?
Finally let’s ggooooo
Man 28 minutes long its really evident the amount of time and work you put into this and it shows.  IT. WAS. ABSOLUTELY. FUCKING. GORGEOUS.

I appreciate the fact that piplup was chosen as the starter, because that’s exactly what I did when I played Pokémon pearl
Oh. My. God. You aren't dead. :0
Sooooooo awesome!

Finally
It’s here
That story was deeper than my soul...😐
charmander died because he used self defense?
FINNALY he’s back!
Let
SO WAIT CHARMANDER IS DEAD?
emotions are like rollercoaster, LOVED IT, i love how i felt for charmander's death, didn't expect him to die and it made me feel sad, damn since im one of the OGs episode 1, i can say how things changed terms of story, MASTERPIECE, it's literally how an anime goes, the begin is fun and all, then it gets serious, and the pace for that was amazing, damn 0 regrets, going to watch the whole series again graphics are GODDAMN amazing, especially the Torrent aura on wartortle
I will never watch your videos poor charlie
Charmander died?!
it came out lets go
What the fuck?
Finally after years I’m so exited
EVERYONE GATHER AROUND! HES BACK!
This was perfect so powerful huge congratulations on getting the episode released 😀
I really hope you could make some new/updated merch for this series
Omg finnally
lv 99 Wartortle btw :) still chance to see the big rocket launchers XD
NO WAY THE LAST TIME I WATCHED THIS WAS IN LIKE G5 OR SOMETHING DUUUDE IM IN G9 WTF
😢
My personal recommendation. Change this thumbnail. I actively LIKE the series but I couldn't notice it was your video because the thumbnail seemed generic.
Awesome! See you in three more years!
Throughout everything, the entire time, Charmander was right. That was a twist I could've never expected.
Damn squirtle calm down you literally broke his jaw
Why you killed charlie
See y'all in the next 3 years for the next episode!
Finally
I was your big fan
OMG LETS GO
yes lets go
Kinda sad that Charmander actually died.. I feel like he kind of carried the whole show
Best one yet
Why why why bro why
At first i didnt think charmander was gonna die
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ah yes... time to wait another 2 years for the next episode.
dear god. this was so emotional, i actually almost cried. I didn't expect charmander to actually die, and squirtle evolving? damn. while i got a few laughs out of this (ex. bulbasaur still eating berries), this for the most part was really deep and left me with a melancholic taste in my mouth.
And that is another half hour well spent on watching this amazing series. Welp time to wait another 2 years
Noooppo why did you make charmander die he was my favorite
Now I want ep 11...
Yessss. I,ve been waiting for this
Takes 10 yrs for one 30min ep
Ayesssssssssss finally!!!!!!!
Something.
Wartortle voice is so deep XD
YEEEEEEES THE LEGEND IS BACK
I love the snow trees 🥰
Really good! The only criticism I have is that when Squirtle evolved the voice change you gave him was not good at all
Man finally all this time is finely here I did not even know qurtle will evolve to woltortle man that was epic it even was better than chamander fight with those caterpies
Finally
So glad to have u back
So Charmander really dead
I forgot how annoying some of the Pokémon are
OMG ITS HEAR AAH
Ok, so is anyone’s else’s mind blow that the first 9 episodes have just been a flashback
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
I remember when episode 1 came out it blew up in an instant. good job man this is absolutely amazing!!! keep up the hard work
YES
where did charmander go
Is it gonna take another year for another episode
Finally! This episode was awesome! Excited to see more and if bulbasaur comes back
F@#$ing finaly
r.i.p charmander 😥😢
YESAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So bulbasours alone
i lost my shit at hearing edatlin outta nowhere
legit forgot this existed and thank you for reminding me😊
So this is why it took so long
Have to say it, but this was bad. Not bad animation or anything just bad in that it really just seems you ran out of steam on the actual Starter Squad adventure and just wanted to to drop it for a new series. Like Smashtasm.
Time to wait for another year
Finally 😁
It's been 500 years!! let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy shit he'll yeah!
I better not wait two years for the next one
Finally another!
This was amazing and worth the wait, thank you so much for making this!!!
Yeah you ended now we have to wait for another 18 years for an 11
You should do bulbasour or chamander next
SQUIRREL SQUAD
The animation has improved so much :o
I’ve waited years
Ok see you next year
Well back to waiting on the slowpoke
Bro please bring back charmander I miss him with my heart and soul
It’s back!!!!!!
That got dark quick! But MAN I love this series.
Squirtle's backstory was nothing like we'd seen in the series, and yet was so well written! Being forced to Proceed as that Caterpie saw fit, even regarding evolution[though that may also have to do with not being like Charmander]... everything that happened after was incredibly well written.
Episode 9: *leaves us in a big cliffhanger*  *2 years later*  Episode 10: oh yea, he died, *ANYWAYS*
And arceus revives everyone, perfect
After 2 years I’m happy bro it’s finally here
Bruh charmander dieeeed nooooooo
Time to wait 2 years for the next episode see yall
Part 10 was epic rip charmander doe
My god seeing charmanders head on top of a caterpie fucked my brain so hard
did the man snort the steroids or something? jeez  great episode.
At 8:30 I had 5 endings mewtwo brings charmander back        Or maybe 4 others….     Mewtwo is the Pokémon god in the mountain and he’s gonna ask how to get his friends back and maybe mewtwo will send him on a quest to find mew and only then will mewtwo tell him but if that does happen then I think that mewtwo will then rule the world
this was so unexpected but im so happy this was made  aa i loved this !! and om g wait he actually did die D:
Holy shit I’ve missed this
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR THIS
YESSSSS, MORE EPS
Thank you
Yes Yes Yes Yes When When When When
Itssssas back after 2 years
Omg finnaly
maybe it's because i haven't watch all 9 other episodes recently but MAN! your animation is amazing for a YouTube series! the water and snow look great and the walking animations for Chimchar, Turwig and Snover are amazing. not to mention how Snow looks. If the wait means we get stuff like this then give me more years to wait!
"What are you gonna ask?" "Something"
Fu** I need to wait for a nother 2 years
Finally episode 10!!!!!
im looking forward to ep. 11 and 12 now cant wait
Who else saw mew two and another Pokémon at 12:51
this is like season 2 with only 1 og character better episodes and more complex story telling
1 year later...
Wait why not yust give charmander a revive
This was wayyy too much to take in like jesus I hope I live long enough to see how it ends. I want that one Caterpie dead edit: oh my god... it's actually on Trending. congrats
I'm pretty sad that bulbasaur left but at least he got the happy ending
POG
Goddamn. Charmander really is dead. Maybe he'll come back as a spirit
its been so long but i am happy ur back
O lord...it's finally here. I remember when I started watching the Starter squad so many years ago. I think I was in middle school...now my last year of college and heading off to university
You gave a trailer, and this was still insane! Although called episode 10, this is much more like Season 2 or even a sequel. Really, this is VERY different from the beginning. -Either you just chose to write differently, or- the abscene of turns and fainting spread far beyond that forest. Don't think we didn't notice 'Char kicking so many Bidoofs in a row, or the overall lack of Humans. ...That's why Squirtle was level 98, isn't it? Without rare candies, that's the only way he'd still have room to evolve twice. There was definitely space when fighting (the most epic Abomasnow ever) for both Watortle and Blastoise, but the full evolution's clearly (literally can be seen) being saved for the final two episodes. Speaking of... is there really space for Missigno AND the Gods, or will it join the scrapped plot? Either way, you've made more than enough from your old lighthearted short. Whatever you decide to do, it'll be renowned!  P.S. Oddly respect the concept of not evolving. Sure, it'd give more power, but Blastoise wouldn't be nearly as nimble. Separately, "Do not attempt to talk to the giant tree"... decent line, but was it worth it? Would've been funny if it truth it was the other Snovers huddled together.
Damn this was amazing...     Aight see you all in 3 years!
e
in the story when the bad things happens was in squrtle destroyd evrything and caterpie  squrtle trainer it means they do all this and its very sad
Something.
Yyyyeeeeeessss finally
Can we get an F in the chat for charmander
10 years later Pokémon Red and Green released in Japan in 1996 Pokémon Diamond and Pearl released in Japan in 2006
Omg
I can’t believe they really ended my boy charmander I was kinda mad and sad that happened
Worth the 2-year wait
Is Charmander coming back
Please don’t take 2 years for episode 11
W episode
PLEASE MAKE CHARMANDER COME BACK OR SOME THING PLSSSSSS
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER
Truly amazing work!
I’m miss charmander
Ok this is cool and all, but Charmander must come back to life as a Charizard or I quit
Worth. The. Wait.
Please make moreee! I love this series Man I wish charmander is alive
It been years
It's back yesss
finily
This series is really awesome keep up the good work
YESSSSS
That evil show man just almost said what the fu*c
Charmander actually died
no entendi ni mdres soy español
so in this time line the pokemon war happened?
Oh my god oh my God OH MY GOD ITS HERE AFTER WAITING FROM CHILD HOOD ITS HERE
What? Why? No! Charmander😢😭
Kinda sucked to be honest 😒
IT'S FINALLY HERE 😀
It was worth the wait keep it up
poor Squirtle he lost everything he loved    that happened to me once
THANK YOU
Ayo
Another 2 years
charmanders plot amour could not help him rip
After so many years he’s back
OMG FINALY I'VE BEN WHATING SO LONG FOR THIS
11:12 "You're just using us to relive your stupid childhood!" Me: Why do I feel personally attacked? XD
Why did charmander have to die
i’ve been waiting for 2 years
Theory: Abamasnow says he works for the gods of space and time. Wartutrle is going ot meet them at the top. So this obviously dialga and palkia. Wartortle will fight them and make them send him back in time to save charmander because he doesn't take orders anymore.
So no Charmander so he is probably dead, and bulbasuar is also probably dead
FINALLY IT'S HERE
It's gooooooooooooooooo! I love this. So much
Charmander please return
... charmander T^T your sacrifice makes us stronger
i am so happy that this came out . . .  but . . .  rlly they just had to actually kill of charmander. we literally waited for like 5 years to see what happened to him and hes just dead??? what happened to the og trio meeting up with mewtwo in zerulian cave to beat the ultimate final boss (the glitched out pokemon) and what happened to all three of them evolving. dang. that sucks.
Until next year my friends
Watch it be a ditto
Killing off the main character and changing the entire story was a bold move… but I’m here for it. I love it. Things need to change sometimes.
I wish that you would make videos daily each week pls
12:51 is that mewtwo vs the Pokémon that got crushed by charmander?
So Nidorina died? Or she ran away since Wiskers was ominous with her last noted words.
Now I know it’s one year and a half,one episode
Finally episode 10 and it was great
This is the best part I'm starting to like you again
Well, now to wait another 2 more years for ep 11
My friend and I keept on saying wel be 80 until the next episode drops
It’s been a whole year and it’s finally out
OMG OMG ITS HAPPENING
FINALLY I’ve been waiting for you
It took almost 2 years but it finally happened
After 2 years
The man is back!
Also I think I predicted it while I was watching it as soon as I saw that not evolving story line I knew at some point he would destroy that stone evolve and absolutely obliterate whatever was standing in his way
I wonder how is mewtwo and missingno will fit into this, also I know the humans say human-human but what were they doing in the situation with the burned forest and the missing child,other stuff? (This episode is great tho)
This many ppl in credits but it takes a year to make 1 ep? Like… bruh
I cannot even explain how much i love Starter Squad. Ship, you’re ability to tell a story…wow. A++
But chhhh is die😞
My guess is that squirtle will find a god Pokémon and ask to go back 10 years to stop charmander from getting killed by killing caterpie instead   Then go to cerulean cave and stop misingo together  God Pokémon is most likely diaga as it's sinnoh region and that's the legendary Pokémon for time so it makes sense
I'm surprised charmander died didn't he have a mission given from Mewtwo to deal with the missing NO?
why does squirtle have extreme eye bags
I’m gonna miss charmander so much!
I accidentally put assessment instead of awesome.
top 10 moments the world celebrated
No no no no. How dare u kill Charmander. Ive waited 2 years for you to kill the best character.  I wont be waiting another 2 years for 11 and 12. Im done now.
Bring back charmander
Holy shit
See you guys in 2055
This was an assessment story. I wish charmander didn’t have to die, though. I cried when I saw caterpie wearing his head on her’s
Comment here if you think squirt will wish for charmander in the next episod and chincar and hopefully he does because he dose not deserve to die like that but mostly I hope that they bring my boy charmader back from the dead somehow please listen and read this comment and here my prayers please
Wartortle is a legendary pokemon now
this was awesome just hope it doesn't take 2 years for another episode xD
it's finally here!!!!!!!!
Cool down, blue buddy. These two fires will be give revive and everything will be ok.
Why has no one said it yet?  God of War(tortle).
WHAT IT HAPPENED NOW

Yo delta charmander is a ghost dragon type and is a skeleton that would fit so much
Yo this is Cool I love it
Love you
Stellar storytelling. I'm glad i waited for this long
Oh my god!! Finally another episode
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Better than the original pokemon show,  up there with season 1 dragon ball z
How does one make almost one episode last 10 years? I like the Squirtle arc but need Charmander back
Did charmander die or alive also what abpit bulbbasaurs
NO WAY after years of waiting its finally here
Finally I’ve been waiting for soo long thank you
Wait what 😢 charmenders is actually dead
I’ve waited so long for this.
wow
Finally, a new Starter Squad video
After 5 years
Charmander’s death was the saddest death in anime history
Great episode
So this whole time squirtle has been telling turtwig what happened, but how did he now the geodude part
ITS FINALLY HERE, and I cannot wait for the next one.
Lyle was a writer in this eh? Interesting! Your animations certainly evolved incredibly well over time!
It been 2 years since a new episode wow
Nooooo
This is fukin art
RIP CHARMANDER 😔
So it  going to be another 2 years till episode 11
2years
Bidoof
WOOOOOOO!
Lol I've been waiting
Man i was so sad right now because charmender die he was my favorite character...😳😳
FINALLY AFTER SO LONG!
Holy shit Wartortle just made the most Iconic line ever!!  "SOMETHING."
He’s back!
Charmander whhyyyyyy?
Where bulbasaur
First episode: Why he didn't choose me? im the cool pokemon Last Episode: KILL GOD
LETS GOOOOO
the voice acting is the best. Imagine being a voice actor for Shippiddge! how amazing all these guys are!
OH MY GOD HE POSTED? AM I TRIPPING BALLS?
What does it take you so long to make 10
See you in 2 years when episode 11 comes out
Finally it's been so longgg
I wish Charmander to be back! 😭 Haven’t seen Bulbasaur yet….
I can't wait for another ETERNITY for the next episode!
The main man is back
The animation is awesome
After all these years.... Finally..... A new episode
This series started as "Cute and kind of edgy adventures of the Kanto Starters" and now we are dealing with a war veteran going to "talk" directly to the gods, most likely in order to travel back in time and stop this mayhem
Yessssa
I hope there will be a plot twist! I hope charmander isn’t not dead and bulbasaur is okay too! 🥺
Hey its been like 2 years good to see you all again!
Oooooo ooooo mmmmm ggggg ooooo ooooo
Stoned bibarrel lol
Charmander dead or what
OH MY GOD ITS OUT
Twist Charmander still alive and evolved into Charizard now is the god at the top of the mountain Designed the rules
Long Awaited Sequel StoryTelling is Legendary!!!!!
After watching this episode, all of my respect for Squirtle went out of the window. He had every chance to be free, but he just had to follow the rules. He was cool back then, and I understand why people like him, but I just don’t see it the same as everyone else.
Where is ep 11
I don’t know what to say I saw this series as a kid and never thought It would ever be this epic but here it is a badass master piece
NO WAY
That was neat. Time to wait another 2 years for the next episode
TYSM I WAS WAITING FOR THIS!
It has finnally arived
I didn’t expect to live to see this day❤️
The Snover/s had me rollin.🤣 Their dialogue feels like something straight out of CowFilms.
*Is this a dream? New episode!*
Gotta wait a whole another year for the next episode
OMG FINALLY A NEW EPISODE CAME YAY 😁
pog?
The day has come…finally after 1 year…IT IS HERE
Holy cow!!! It's damn good
bring charmander in video
He said wtf
Only 5 hours llate
NO!!! CHARMANDER!!!! 😭😭😭😭
It's been so long
I know it probably won’t happen, but Arceus or the Creation Trio could revive Charmander, Chimchar, Whiskers, or anyone else Wartortle has lost. Like I said, it probably won’t happen because of the dark nature of this series, but it’s a possibility.
Finally, it has been 2 years.
Will the series continue?
I am surprised you were bold enougt to kill off charmander, but it think was for the best. Amazing episode  By the way, what happened to  bulbasaur? If everyone in the caterpie army is gone, I imagine bulbasaur should be dead too (specially since they were fighting flying types)
Oh Dios no
I wish it carried from the last epidode and they went to meet mewtwo but great episode nonetheless
The giant snow monster was like what the-
When people needed him most, he returned. Seriously this used to be a Pokémon parody. But now it’s a full on series on many qualities in life. Loyalty, friendship, and even choice
Blue shell man guy is the best superhero
Can’t wait to see the end keep up the awesome work
Didn’t think squirtle or now wartorle would turn out to be the main character great work
I never thought it was going to come back, I’m so happy
So did Piplup get chosen?
*Sad Music for Charmander* 😭😭😭
Finllay
100k views? Within a week it’ll be a million and I’ll change my name if it doesn’t
Been here since episode 1
Can't wait for Episode 11 and 12. Super hype that for sure.
It took 2 YEARS TO MAKE 1 EPISODE THE FUCK
awww no charmander  also good content waiting over 2 years was worth it
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I SWEAR WE NEED A ANIME VERSION OF THIS
So Charmander is dead, Bulbasaur is a cow and loves it, blue shell man guy is a lvl 98 and just evolved. Caterpie started a war and lost everything and realized she did wrong and let bluey live his own life and now he is going to slay gods. So what about missingno bluey never knew about him since Mewtwo only told char and Bulbasaur.
God of war type shiz right here
But I like this video Shippiddge
ep 10........its so dark😨😨😨 love it 😄
Man I liked bulbasaur
"Who are they to decide that?!"  Wartortle va Escanor?! Battle of the chads
NO WAY
lmfao I just rewatched 1-9 yesterday. this is dope
I am mad lucky because I just started re-watching this
This was totally unexpected... I was kinda hoping for the "other route." Oh well.
Finally
Finally 😎
Omg- what it’s happening again I- I thought the day would never come WHAT!
I'm not sure how we went from the plot of 'Charmander learns empathy' to 'Squirtle kills god' but I'm down for it.
I wake up on a Saturday morning and there's Pokemon waiting to be watched yay :)
FINALLYYYYYY
Chimchar sounds like tara strong
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSS ITS FINALY HERE WOOOOOO
This series has grown with us & it just get better RIP Charmander
OHMYGOD ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
noo charmander died
Holy shit no way
damn it Charzard is dead I liked that Pokémon he was funny and a cool leader now the other guy is in charge his past is messed up and totally has a PTSD really he slaughter every pokemon in sight. anyway I'm looking forward for ep 11 and 12
WAIT CHARMANDER????
Squirtle. And A turtwig ? Here is a piplup. What is turtwig & chimchar & PIPLUP not turtwig & chimchar & squirtle whatever happens if Charmander and Bulbasaur
I was five when i start looking this
Charmander died? What happen to bulbasaur?
2 more left
Man, that was totally epic. I honestly can't wait to see the last two episodes of this series.
plzz bring charmader back shippiddge
i was here
HELLLLLL YEEEEEESSSSSSSS
so basically uh, Squirtle has ptsd
What n-no BRING CHARMANDER BACK TO LIFE!!!!!
Thx for new ep
Plot twist: full revives are being mass produced to save the Pokémon that died, and now has amnesia at a Pokémon center
There's only been a 2 year wait for this masterpiece, what's 2 more years ey guys?
Nice
HE IS BACK
it was worth the wait now ... to wait another 2 or 3 years
This is just a theory, but I think that Wartortle is going to ask the pokemon gods to rewind time, and probably either make squirle fight with charmander, the gang to never leave the lab, or for charmander to be chosen by the initial trainer instead of squirtle
Finally a new episode.
Now we wait 2 more years for another even more epic episode. 😂😂
8:56 yooooo his voice is in this?!?!?!
Holy moly so all my old questions were answered. Charmander is gone but I sense some of him in Chimchar. And Squirtle was set free. Now he has evolved question if he's level 98 shouldn't he just be a Blastoise.
Charmander died no why ep 9 is so sad.
When is the next episode love these series I could re watch them all day!!!🤩
I only care about Missingno. I have never seen anything scarier than what happened to Hitmonchan and Haunter.
FINALLY! TYSM. i was waiting so long. i didnt know if it would ever happen
you HAD to kill Charmander....wow he was my favorite character...
Terrible
IS HE GONNA REVIVE CHARMANDER AND CHIMCHAR
Why did you have charmander die
Happy to be a part of this journey
And when the world needed him most…  HE CAME BACK
ITS OUUTTTT
Now Damn this was amazing… well see you in 3 years
AWESOME VIDEO MY GOD WOW THAT TIMESKIP TURN OUT REALLY GREAT
This guy really did make a new viedo
O que aconteceu com chamader
This God of War looks strange
Wait-if squirtle is lvl 98 why cant he evolve???
Depois faça o episódio 11
YES EPISODE I and bidoof's vs chimchar. YAAAAAA
Okay this is awesome
Charmander and Chimchar?? Im going on strike until the next episode! i cant believe this!
WORTH THE TIME TOTALLY
He hasnt even reached his finale evolution and hes already a bad ass
LES GOOOO IT'S FINALLY OUT
Squirtle really lives through pain, great episodes
Nooo really charmander is dead
After a year of waiting
This is so awesome I can’t wait for episode 11
3 years later ; )
OK now lets just wait anoder 1000 yers for 11 ep
Wow this took a hell of a turn, was not expecting ANY of this from the last episode
Anyone else see mewtoo fighting the missing no thing Edit, found it 12:51
Waited too long for this episode, but damn!!!!!!! THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT! Keep up the great story narrative 👍🏽
Squirtle looked like he had no soul when he was trained by caterpie. He should not even be trained by a the worst pokemon ever so that is partyly his fault.
I love how it went to a starter squad trying to live without humans but now its dark
Finaly
This was the most epic!!! It was an kinda sad ending seeing char ded and an squirttle seeing flash backs of his friends dying
Finally squwartul evolved
Yaya
Overtime this series has turned from a comedy web series into a full-on epic Pokémon fan fiction tackling really strong topics like friendship, freedom, belonging and purpose  The quality in story has improved greatly along with the animation and effect quality   Thank you so much for making this. Can’t express how much I love it  I can’t wait to see how it all ends.
Where its charizard and idk but where seryous you changes the caracters
we want part 11
How the hell did it turn from cheesy light comedy to mix of God of war and Brutal legend!? :V
lets go its been too long
The writing feels like it hasn't aged a damn day. This is fantastic!
Where’s bulbasaur
HOLY FUCK
7:58  ;-;
And then Charmander seats back in the white space as he reacts huh the worms give up faith in themselves wow I wasn’t really expecting that oh well at least squrtle finally made his choice in life I’m proud of him now what oh and *MAKE ANOTHER EPISODE* I wanna see more that slowpoke Jesus Christ I put effort in to that really god relax let have break here
NOT YOUR LITTLE TREE FEELINGS!!!!!
Amazing episode, now to wait for the next one for like another year 😊

Holy crap! Was not expecting the episode to go to this direction.  This was amazing and now I'm just really curious what is gonna happen next! Especially cause I thought for some reason that this was gonna be last one.
8 years, 2 episodes left.
Omg you are back 😭
Squrtle finally evolved
That was truly amazing, the only thing I'm not sure about is wartortle's  voice
This is totally EPIC!!!! Totally deserved the wait!
Wtf

NOOOOOO i wish thta charmander was still alive
Finally It’s here
Charmander is goooone? FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
I know we saw Charmander get stabbed but I want him to come back he was funny
Alright another year for next episode 😑😑

FINNALY
I watched all epsiodes since the first you are my childhood
"WHAT THE F-" -Abomasnow's last words
Make episode faster pls
Now we wait another year
And it's also sad to see that Squirtle didn't learn the truth about why Charmander came into the Caterpie cave
Finally!!!
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I’m so glad that another episode has been released keep up the good work
I can not believe charmander is dead man that shocks me.
FINALLY
Let's goooooooo
I love this video if it’s not the last one make. More. Please oh and it’s sad that charmander and char died 😢😭😭😭😢😭😭😢😢😭
It’s finally here let’s wait 4 years for ep 11
OH SHIT YOU BEAUTIFUL SLOW BASTERD!
This started.... from a small animation of original starters wanting to be picked by Red....  God I love the internet! And I love people that make stuff like that.  Take a concept, something that just sounds like a stupid short story, just like... a very simple thing. And turn it to this, even when you think it's impossible to make something good out of it, because the concept is too silly, people on here will make it work. AND THEY WILL MAKE IT GOOD.
I WAITED FOR A YEAR JUST FOR THIS…..                 *nice*
I thought he but? I? Charmander… you know the blue guy might be the most hated guy now
What!!!!!! So Charmander die😢
I can't wait to rewatch every episode and watch this one again just to remember the story cause it's fun and enjoyable heh
After 2 years we finally got a awesome episode
OMG TYSM FOR THE NEW EPISODE
Oh look, my fave pokemon looks badass, you love to see it
Noooo Charmander Noooo
How the Pokémon story should of been told 😂
dude pls dont leave us for like another 4 years
YASSSSSSSSS
These are my favorite Pokémon videos
OMG finally
He evolved I’m so hyped!!!!!!
Mewtwo fighting missingno 12:51
Well charmanders ded I'm done
bro I  thought this shit was never coming out s stir show
Where is mewtwo and cerulean cave?

Me: watching squirtle memories. Me: wait where charmander and bulbasaur?  Edit: well didn’t know charmander actually die.
ITS OUT YESSSSS
The legends where worng it’s real
Wait what happened to charmander!?
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

I woke up this morning and saw this on my recommend and freaked out
8:03
I have a Squirtle plushie for a reason. This episode is why.
Finally
Damn that was awesome can't wait the next 2 years for episodes 11
just a wild guess that the new episode gonna be the fastest episode made
I have a theory maybe they will take charmanders head and put him into the scniece thing that revives Pokémon
YES EPISODE 10 boyzzz
For a second I thought that was the Black ops zombies origins OP but it wasnt. At the end by the way
No Charmander died he was supposed to live dang it he had to meet Mewtwo at the cerulean cave and he died
Honestly i have just screamed and clapped so hard when i saw this on recommendations ♥ worth waiting
Oh my god
Finally here loll
This whole thing is awesome my son loves the Geo dude part best of all
SQIURDL EVOLED😱😱!
This is AWESOME
Kudos to you, Chief Shipp. Every work you make pays off. I want to kill that fire monkey.
It’s been 2 thousand years! At last!
Cant believe this came from the Kanto Starters on goofy adventures.
There's a way to bring back charmander 1st you need his head 2nd you need his body then you go to one of the healing machines for pokemon and you grab the pokemon ball and put charmander inside the pokemon ball put him on the healer he should be good as new
ITS BEN 1200 YEARS IVE BEN WAITING SENCE 2ND GRADE IM LITERALLY AM 45 YRS
Racism
EP 10 IS OUT LES GOOOOOOOO
Yo the war flashbacks were super interesting. Would love if you did a side series about it more but overall the video 100/10

Finally
So Charmander is dead
Please....please don't leave us for another 2 years again...
Finally the day has come I've been waiting love the videos
2 more episodes
So what happened to charmander
can you please make a channel for the music ! Its so epic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      well i'd rate this 101 percent epic
2:14 - 2:16 I can see Squirtle getting ptsd from this... omg He called chimchar char which could also be short for charmander, that's pretty clever
Before I watch this, I want to express how excited I am right now. I remember watching this series a long time ago and can't believe it's still going. I don't know if this is the last episode but either way LETS GOOOO
I miss charmander that dumb worm thinks  he’s a hat now  :(
YEAHHHHHH SO COOL

I dont like this why did you make charmander die now i dont love starter squad. Speaking of starter squad THIS WAS NOT EVEN STARTER SQUAD! WHERE IS BULBASAUR WHERES CHARMANDER!!!!!!!
Its been so long
Ik it’s impossible but it would be so cool if charmander and bulbasaur were still alive somehow
I mean Im happy Charmander's dead. cuz Fuck him and his inter line. But why ya gonna make one my secondary fav pokemon Chimchar seem like an asshole? and kill him too...?   Also since it has been 10 years since then, Im guessing the whole problem with MissingNo. and Mewtwo are all handled as it is
It's been two years
Oh my such an amazing episode

It’s BAAAACK!!!!
This was overall interesting… and actually is sad, it’s not even the starter squad anymore, just wartortle and his adventure of what awaits him… great job honestly, it was worth the wait. For now, we have 2 episodes left.
good stuff
The story is now not the same charmander is dead bulbasur is staying to be food I'm sad
This was sick
First off… THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO MAKE THESE, I LOVE YOU.  Second, it really sucks that charmander is really gone… it makes me sad. ): but this is a cool direction… Squirtle’s on a Kratos revenge story how cool lol
It’s been 50 years since I saw the lay episode little Timmy

Aww man charamnder dead now i dont want to watch this series
It’s been 84 years ago
You finally made this
FINALLY
finnaly
bro, charmander was the real protaginist  I know you want to give squirtle the main role but charmander needs to come back .Well something happened to charmader between because at the last flashback the head was not there ,I think the forest was burned by charmander only or something like this , I hope the dought would be cleared by the next episode .
Bring back Bulbasaur please please he was my favorite character I beg you bring him back please
My life have been waiting  for this
LOL Chamander.
When will Charmander come back?
I didn't expect this to be an emotional rollercoaster. Fantastic job. Can't wait for the finale. :D
FINNALY
Finally!!!!!
I have a feeling a certain Sinnoh legendary Pokémon (no coincidence that the Sinnoh starters are there now) will make an appearance because of his particular abilities.
So squirtel will go and revive the monkey and then charmander right?
Such a masterpiece great work man
ngl pretty underwhelming but hey now we don't need to wait we just gotta wait for part 11
See you next year
ok guys lets wait for next 1 or 2 years for the 11th episode .
WOW

Rip charmander I’m ganna miss him😭😭😭😭
wat hpened to charmader and sruff
it was worth the wait
We want Bulbasaur back !! Wonderful job ! Episode a bit chill to my mind, but your job is just,  you know, "WOW !!!🔥". Keep going dude, we're all waiting each next episode as it was Christmas ! 🤩
aye I was in the end credits
the wait finally over, now its time to wait 1 year more for other episode
NO!!!! CHARMANDER!!!!!! 😭😭😭
This gonna be so cool
I hope the next episode will come out soon
Let's gooo
I love this please god I want the next 2 :)
Yes a upload
I really hope he can meet dialga and travel back in time ^^''
Yes.
Charmander died welll what’s the point in this series
Someone remind me to watch this when I have wifi
This was so damn good! The animation, the story itself, the mix of playful comedy and serious tragedies... This has been cooking for years and I do say the story baked is well done!  As for my personal feelings? I fucking loved it, could understand Squirtle's feelings very well, and can see how this turned after ep.9. I will say that the Catierpie leader really took the phrase: 'You don't know what you have till it's gone.' Very seriously. But it makes sense in a way. She only saw the pros at the end, never realizing that the cons could(and very clearly did) wipe out both the opposing sides with the forest. Only when the fires go out and the ash settled did it finally, absolutely final, that it clicked to her. She was warned, now she has nothing to lose at all.  That is the beauty of this story as we could see that exact thing coming before it did, if you analyze Charmander's story. You could see some of the Pokemon around him change when they meet Charmander and deal with him breaking the rules. That, of it could just be me reaching here.  Also the thing Squirtle fears? I actually don't know, it flew over my head. I watched this repeatedly and can't find the awnser. Not a solid one anyway. If someone could help me, that be a great help!
I think Charmander will come back as gastly
Ultra trutle
12:49 mewtwo fights missingno. So maybe mewtwo pulls some strins to help Charmander but this is rather unlikely because how much it seems mewtwo hates Charmander but it is possible and that’s why he appeared here as a Easter egg to see how Charmander comes back to life. Or arceus  does it or the more likely situation Charmander is just ded.
IM BLUE SHELL DA BA DEE DA BA DIE DA BA DEE DA BA DIE DA BA DEE DA BA DIE
noooooooooooooo charmander
If only Squirtle were a crab such as myself, all this wouldn't have happened
Awesome next ep 11 please but more epit ok
I’ve never been more disappointed in my life than in this episode when the credits started to roll.  Just please, don’t make us wait two years for the next one. This whole series is genius.
LESSSS FUCKKKING GOOO
The long wait was worth it cause this was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When is episode 11 and don’t tell me I have to wait another year or 2
I waited 2 years for this and you definitely delivered. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect this to be what happened
Even though it was almost half an hour it feels like barely anything happened. Yes the quality was great and you are an amazing animator but I'm not sure why this felt less then episode 9.
Killing characters like attack on Titan lmao
YOOOOO! WTF you’re finally back!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wait if all the caterpies died, then what happened to Bulbasaur?
Nya
I think this episode was worth the wait. This was probably the riskiest episode so far but I think it’ll pay off in the end. I’m interested to see where this series wi go now that Squirtle has evolved, and if we’ll see the other two starters in the final two episodes
Let’s go talk to this deity and time travel. Save Charmander and that would also save Chimchar in a way. That’s my prediction.
That was really good... ill see you guys again in a year or two
22:59 t fuc
it's just not the same if charmander is not here....  charmander made good character development even if its only been 9 episodes
Cool story btw
What happens next
2 years of waiting ..... , FINALLY
Time to wait 2 more years for the next one!
i miss charmender  :(

Isn’t people gonna realise that the hat that caterpie is wearing is charmanders head
Yayyyy new episode
Support Comment :)
It’s been a year
rip charmander ;(
Wow, I did not like this one bit. It sort of left the whole MissingNo story arc abandoned.
is this is the last episode?
It’s nice to see the series is finally back and not forgotten. Can’t wait for episode 11
You can't just kill off charmander like that expecially off camera
I hope the old squad comes back and the squad now meets
Hi
Finally ep 10!
Finally didn’t take 3 uhm 5 years
ITS HERE!
Finally after a year
Worth the wait I love it!!!!!!
What Squirtle has done??  Why would he?? Jesus fuck..  And he let Charmander die? Damn..   But I know you have a plot twist somewhere.. you are a good writer.
OH MY GOD FINALLY
I can’t believe it’s already been two years since episode nine has released and now two years later we get this. It looks a bit different but it still has the charm that the original starter squad episodes have
R.I.P CHarmander 2019 to 2021
can't wait for the next episode this brought me back nostalgia and happiness so keep it up!!!
its back Lets go
I’m glad the meme is back :) 22:59
squirtle lookin' like he hasn't slep in like 4 days

Omg it’s finally out
I forgot Charmander fucking died

finally its out
When the world needed him most, he made a new episode
Thank you so much. This made me feel the same feelings as watching godzilla vs kong.
LOL I JUST MAKED THAT COMMENT NW AND SOMEONE COMMENTED 1 SECOND AGO
Omg this episode was amazing this series is amazing
Yessss
I think…. Maybe bulbasaur goes off to the wild and….squirtle evolves and he probably meets mewtwo and goes back in time to kill the caterpie leader to save charmander!
Pokemon God of war XD
Lo bueno de saber inglés es que no necesitas a que alguien lo traduzca :u
FINALLY
HES BACk!?!!!!!!!!!
Part 11
Now we got wait another year :(
Why’d charmander and bulbasaur change, exactly?
FINALLY
why is there a new comment in every second
YOOOoOo
12:49 mewtwo and glitch Boi I forgot his name
Going to wait another 2 years for ep 11
Bruh it took FOREVER for the slowpoke to make this. I love it
^
Charmander is dead 🥺
A lot of people thought charmander is alive
Okay I like episode 10 but the thing I don't like about it when Charmander is dead I am really sad about it
Worth the wait
I really hope the Charmander return he was my favorite character
MAKE MORE MAKE MORE I LOVE YOUR POKEMON STARTER SQUAD  VIDS
Welp, at least I know Charmander did unfortunately die. I wonder if Shippidge will start using mega evolution. I want to see Bulbasaur again too.
My guess is that he is gonna or either the Pokemon god's gonna revive charmander
YES FINALLY
Hmaz's imagination of a fire ghost chinchar evokes us coming true
WOW👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
a year of wait  just for this… I’m disappointed as hell
OMG
Rip charmander, hopefully he shall be brought back
They're finally back
YYYEEEAAAAHHHEEEAAAAYYY AAAAHHHH
What an absolute masterpiece, goddamn.
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿🥶😫😫😫😫🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🖕🖕🖕😿🙀👿
Amazing work man
where charmandar go?
See you in the next 500 years
One year letter
no way then what happend to s charmander
Please don't take a year to make the next one
Finally 😍😍
I’ve been waiting so long finally the story will come to an end
YES IV BEEN WAITING
The last episode was 2 Years ago And episode 10 is finally here
So, is this story getting meta? Considering Hitmochan became a glitch and Mewtwo's fighting Missingno., another glitch, I'm thinking the Gods might end up being the game makers. Just a thought. Btw, love the song in the credits. Really has a taking-on-the-gods vibe.
Well we waited for an entire year for dis probaly gonna take another year for another episode
Finally e.p 10 is here
I am so mad. My boy Charmander died
dude u gonna make us wait 2 years again or no 😭
I bet bulbasaur’s happy ending is just eating all of sandslash’s berries
Damn I actually thought charmander is the main character and gonna live through the end
Finally it's out
the caterpie at 12:28 in the right is the caterpie at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWvFP-vXNY&t=625s ? on the right?
You know Chimchar = Charmander Turtwig = Bulbasaur
12:50
Finally
HOLY **** ITS OUT YOOOOOOOO IVE BEEN WAITING THIS FOR SO LONG
Its here!!!! Its finally here!!! It took 1year i mean i see why, it’s a 28 minute video.
Finally!
FINALLY AFTER 3 YEARS ZOMG!!!!!!
It's my birthday thank you
:😞 charmander 😞  I really hope i don't die before this series is finished
omg i waited so long for this
"What are you gonna ask?" What i thought warturtle would say: "How many moves its gonna take to spill their blood." What he actually said: "Something."
Man I thought you died 🤣🤣
Poor charmander he was my faveret poke
no wonder it took so long... 28 minutes  shippiddge i love your videos
worth the 2 year wait
Let’s go bro. You finally did it! Only took u 2 years!     Jokes aside, I’m certain u worked very hard on this project and I hope you recover from the difficulties from COVID that have cost you time. My one request is that… can u make episode 12 release a bit fast. Also great work on the animation! It’s so much better
We crave more more !!!!!!!
finally
I don't remember those moves, then again i don't even play pokemon so who am i to say :/
Wartortle Welcome 🙏
Charmander dead or something?, or did he evolve and is now roaming the world
Now ep 11 will release in 80-100 years😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
IM A BIRD BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME TWEET TWEET
Its been 3000 years ;3;
Literally any Pokémon: We live in a society  Chim Char: And I took that personally
It's been 10,000 years.
this was too much to handle. my heart.
Damn rip charmander

Rip Charmander
Finally episode 10 I was waiting for this all day
“Blue shell man guy”
YESSSSS
What happened to charmander???
Is it true? He’s back.
I wish they made an episode for bulbasaur evolving in battle like squirtle 😁👍
i wonder why it took 2 years to make one more episode also i just noticed that one of the caterpillars has charmander's head as a hat.
dont revives exist?
Now I got to wait for ep 11 that’s prob going to be in a year
Now to wait for another 3 years
Yay! I'm so excited to wait another 2 years!!!!
No way
4 hours late,but I’m still here. Happy I’ve been along this journey. Edit: Ayo I was joking,I didn’t actually think Charmander was dead.
youtube i beg of you put this in someones recommended
Finely it has been 1 year
Make char come back with max revive
Wow you finally did it, I must say this was much more than how i expected ep 10 would be
Dayum
Well, since Charmander died then I'm dropping this pathetic shit. He got all that character development for nothing when he just wanted to save his friend. Shitty story telling by making Squirtle the main now and evolving. Been fun but turned out horrible now.
Man this was awesome
I'm impressed... Of everything. I'd never thought Charmander would die like this. And dying... It's never gonna happen in a Pokemon game, and that's what makes this project so amazing and dark and exciting. Charmander had been learning empathy before he died, and honestly, the star of this project.   This... Took an unexpecting turn. In "Three More Left", Charmander and Bulbasaur were in some mysterious place, ironically it looks like Missingno and there's a Ghastly in it. After the episode 10 preview, Squirtle is probably the only one that survives.   Chimchar and Charmander had a lot in common, both had similar personalities, similar colors, had "char" (meaning "to burn") in their name, died and Squirtle was sad about it. And probably the only reason Squirtle chose to help Chimchar, he failed to help and guide Charmander and hope that he can return the favor. If Caterpie had not trained Squirtle to be completely loyal, on a blind level, to trust him, Squirtle might have prevented this war from happening. The despair of knowing the wrongs and can't do anything about it made a huge impact on him. Normal people might have already given up, but Squirtle turned that to the motivation to do what he believes is right. And that, made me respect Squirtle a lot.   I am very excited for another episode and hoping that Wartortle will become Blastoise! The animation, voice acting, plot, story-telling is all so great and definitely worth the wait. But looks like it will be "Two Episodes Left", I'm sad this series is coming to an end because of how great it was. Honestly I would be totally excited if Shipp can start another amazing project after this. Also, looking forward to Charmander, if possible.   Thank you Shipp and his team for this amazing project! I'm so glad I found this!
NO WAY
Nooooooo not. Char
Cool man well done
WOOHOO
Now we just need to wait another 10 years
No way! No way no way no way! Awesome  Also the animation feels way more smooth and better than last time, worth the wait dude
No no my favorite is gone not Bulbasaur
It took you this long
Unlike most other show the 1st protagonist actually died
HOLY FUCK AFTER SO MANY YEARS IVE WAITED FOR THIS
I thought charmander was gonna catch the stick and blow his head off why did he just sit there
Love this
And now I'll wait for the next one, whatever it takes
HHEEEEESSSS NNNNNOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT DDDDDDEEEEEEEAAAAAADDDDD
Thank god
i wonder what bulbasaur

YESSSSS
Charmander character and attitude , he is a mascot of this series.
Jesus Christ, I it's finally here, I can rest
This is just crazy!!!!😁❤️😆🔥
Two years ago: Playful battle between starter pokemon who don't want to be battle pets against an army of worms  Today: Main character dead, the atrocities of War front and center, Squirtle goes full "All Quiet on the Western Front" and decides to fight God...  I see the pandemic was rough on Shippidge too
I’m sad Charizard died
Charmander is dead
OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Imagine it the ghost of charmander at the top wanting revenge
After so many years   He's back
yesssss
ALAS IT'S HERE
He evolve into Wartortle!!! 😬😲🤯
And this was a parody series
I've been waiting 2 years for this im so happy

So many years but it's finally here

Strangely. Those Snover makes me want to stare directly into the sun and get superpowers.
I’m never catching a caterpie ever In Pokémon
bro this is carzy Squirtle look's so tired and  Charmander  i cant see the next episode
Finally!
After 2 years, it’s finally here and I’m so excited. The series is really enjoyable and I loved it. It was worth the wait
I liked Snover voice acting.
Holy shut a 30 min episode, this is AWESOME, been watching since episode 2
I want in that wortotale know that the charmander have been alive and envolved into chardizard
Tank you ;)
FINNALY
Start working on episode 11 right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Funny that this has one of the themes of Frailty(which I just watched), in terms of "God doesn't control what you do, but you yourself controls whatever you do"
Thank god I was waiting this is so good bro. Although I wish charmander was back
The day is here FINALLY
FINALLY EP 10 YESSSS
After 10 years....
omg its out
Well time for my opinion.. “Human. Human HUman. Human human human.”
YASSSSSS FINALLY
Tree man just goes WHAT THE F-
Finally the masterpiece is here
Wow this is dark well everyone let’s get into the waiting game
finalyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Charmander😢😢😢😢
10:12 I use my hair to express myself
Anybody see mew and mewtwo? Or am i tripping haha
finally after all this time, this was worth the wait.
Aight, see y'all in 4 years when episode 11 releases
WHEN WE NEEDED HIM MOST,    *HE RETURNED!!!!*
Watching the start, I'm so confused
FINALLLY
4.9k
Here before this blows up
FINNALY
very good
LETS FUCKING GO
Now we wait until 2025 for episode 11
It’s finally out!! And it’s AMAZING.
now time to wait another 2 years.
It’s finally here
This was amazing.
YESSSSSS
This is just badass
Is it just me or does this episode have some video game vibes.
Mewtwo at 12:51
When is the next episode
Oh boy 2 more years for a new episode
Yay!!!!
THE BEST
he`s finally back
FINALLY
YES
we need the lizard back.
Love that while squirtle and caterpie are busy destroying the birds. Mewtwo and missingo are still battling
Yay now just another…2…years…
i love this movie😄
That was totally... AWESOME!!!!  But I feel sad for Charmander death. But where is Bulbasaur? I hope he's not dead..
I hope the next episode doesn't take as long to finish. I don't know if I could handle another 2-year wait.
it’s out holy shit
Noooooooo I was hoping Charmander would some how come back to life
There’s two ways they could revive charmander, rather going to the gods or using more traditional Pokemon and treating his body like a fossil.
It was way better when charmander was there
This series kinda changed my perception of pokemon
How come he is level 98 and he doesn’t evolve
FINALLY THE 10 EP IS HERE
IT'S FINALLY HERE!!! WHOOOOAAAA!!!
After 2 years its finally here, AVE TRUE TO CAESAR!
Yessss
Wow I waited 2 years for this….
Bro This just hit another level……
AMAZING STUFF! I would've never known the story-telling would get this good....
Wholesome series i been waiting for years for this sheeesh
What the fucking shit i remember this i used to die waiting for the 10th episode.
This series is so under rated
Arceus be dammed. That was INCREDIBLE! Story, visuals, ugh!!! Still a shame that [Spoilers ahead]      Charmander actually died... and we don't even know where Bulbasaur is, this Squirtle has been through hell, I hope he has a good ending... he was the one voice of reason...
I’m glad this is back
wow its been so long i thought charmander would of survived
7:58 oh that’s really dark
THANK YOU SQUIRTLE YOU HAVE SAVED US ALL FROM THIS EVERLASTING WAIT FOR EPISODE 10!
im so happt that part 10 is released cant wait for the other 2 episodes!
👏👏👏 great job
Its back!!
It's like the YouTube Gods knew and made me re watch the full series to catch up for this moment
I'm so excited and happy for episode 10
Finally after 3000 years
bruh poor charmander ;(
Finally
I think the final boss is charmander or bulbasaur
I am not satisfied with this episode... expected better one
Uhhh man Charmander is dead
That was awesome, well worth the wait. I’m interested in the direction the story is going.
that way more dark than I thought it would be
after years its out LESSSSSSS GO
I want to say…I’m really sad about charmanders death.
Bruh they really killed charmander tho
ITS FINALLY HERE!
*insert excited screaming here*
Aight. See you in 2030 when Episode 11 is out
When’s the next one I waited a very long time
Man, that was great, All right see you all in a year.
OMG thank u for making this video continue  doing this
that was brilliant!
Charmander, noooo
I.....genuinely did not expect anything that happened in this episode, yet here we are.
YYYEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!
I have waited an year for this, and I must say, it was WORTH IT
me: *sees this* Huh that was a nice series, too bad i haven't heard of episode 10 since a wh-   HOLD ON THIS IS EPISODE 10
Squirtle, you have truly evolved
No! I don't like charmender dying anding! Plese! Save charmender at next ep11!
Finnaly man
It takes to 1year for an ep10
What happened to  Connor O’brien (the voice of bulbasaur)? He isn’t in the credits at all
Wonder what the mewtwo easter egg  was about?
Kyaaa it's finally here !!!
its here boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis
Lets gooooo
That was not what I expected
Did you actually kill off bulbasaur? Because hands down best character is bulbasaur!
Finally
FINALLY
thanks for returning your alegend :D
This is was one of the best things I’ve seen in YouTube, I can tell you put a lot of passion and effort into your storytelling. I never would’ve expected charmander to actually be dead, and the flashbacks of the caterpie war, seeing squirtle just accept his life as a soldier, and seeing him following a NEW hotheaded individual, finally let himself evolve, all of it, was amazing to say the least, and I’m super excited to see more of what you have in store, no matter how long it takes :)
Wait the last episode was two years where did that time go?
AHHHHHHH WHAT THE FRICKJK YESSSS
I sense dialga palkia and arceus  have something to do with the solution to Our heroes word
Holy crap it's real!! Yay
WHAT THE FAAAAAAAAA(error restart) (restarted complete) ITS OUT YAAAASSS
ITS HEEEEEEEEEERRRE!!!!!!
Beautiful
Yessss letsss gooo
After a years you realis starter squad 10
Ok 10:21 ptsd confirmed
Hey I think you will need a animation team to finish episode 11 and 12
Poor charmander
This is actually kinda depressing
Whatever happened to Bulbasaur
2 more left it sad that Charmander died and everything went to ash can't wait for the next episode great job
Damn that was way different then what I expected but it was really good
He uploads videos like berserk. Damn can't believe he actually uploaded it
You guys have so much talent. Congrats for the release.
A question are bulbasaur and chamender dead
That’s it , charmander died , I’m gonna leave this series until something cooler happens
Finally
THE WAIT IS OVER AND IT WAS WORTH IT
This came out on my birthday- also how u finna do charmander like that 😭 Edit: by the time the next one comes out I’ll be an adult/j 😂 (I appreciate what you do and I know these take a lot of time and work keep it up!)
I’ve been waiting for this for forever, so worth it!
Wait what I just saw mewtwo but what was he fighting 12:49
Yay they are back
Man, this series has come far!
Finally it's back please do up to 50 episodes
FINALY
So, umm... what about mewtwo and Missingno.?
This episode hit me hard, but it got me thinking well and good after my nightmare last night. Just like how Wartortle did, the best way to live life is to live it our own way, not by what someone expects or demands from us. I used to live that type of "do as expected of you, or else" life back then, and I've hurt a lot of people because of that. Now? I'll be moving out to my boyfriend AND girlfriend next month, where the four of us (since our girlfriend has a son) can be a whole and complete family together. Plus, my partners have been through similar hardships as I have, so our bonds have only gotten stronger since we got back together from years of our drama and loss. This episode of Starter Squad was a very good reminder of not only keeping my head up high but also to do the best that only I can do. I'm my own person and always have been.  Thanks, Shippidge. Keep up the awesome work, and I'll be happy to wait for as long as it takes for the last two episodes. More importantly, I hope you're having a great time making this series with your pals and cohorts. Toodles! 💙
Bout fucking time omg
I'm imagining Wartortle learning Scald, and turning the surrounding ice and snow into a giant lake to fight in.
Oh please tell me the thing he is gonna ask for the pokemon gods to bring charmander back not char the starter squed would not be complete if there was not all three starters at least from generation 1
ITS here
OMG THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes finally
I love the second ep 10 please make more
This is taking a very interesting turn. Love it, can’t wait to see how the story continues!!
Amazing story!!! This stuff is better then most Hollywood, Netflix bs. Thank you for the amazing plot!!! I’m so excited for what comes next
what charmander's dead when he's almost level 3/4??
Awesome. What a rollercoaster of emotions! Can’t wait for the next episode
There are many cliffhangs for this episode.
People who are watching this for the first time are so lucky
CAP
Watch Arceus Reset time and somehow make sure Red pick Charmander 😂.
YES, another episode, I kinda need to watch older episodes do a recap.
ITS HEREEEEE
You're god tier dude 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Turtwig's reaction is all of ours.
Omg we waited so long and finally its here.
I loved everything about this, what a journey this has been
wartortle look like kratos
To think I’ve been watching this series since I was in middle school and now im in college still watching it, I can’t wait to finish it by the time I I graduate!
Whoa! What an episode! Can’t wait wait until episode 11! Is the plan still 12 episodes? No matter what happens what a Jolly good series! 😂🤣😂
dynamax haters: 22:24
For a wait this was definitely worth waiting for!!!
What kind of starter team is this now? I where waiting for this episode ocer 2 years and I see charmander died and idk what happened to bulbasaur
How it started: 3 starters messing around How its going: Severe PTSD.
POG
Best fanmade series
The wait is finally over.
I AM SO HAPPY MY FAVORITE SEIRIES WHEN I WAS 7 IS HAVING A NEXT EPISODE LESSS GOOOO 🥳
Absolutely incredible
Definitely a U-turn from the comedy to tragedy. I can see the show growing exponentially from this!! How much as it broke my heart I think it was a good creative step!!
A level 99 wartortle vs the world and going on a personal war this will be insane just wish charmander was here to see itt
Guys I have a theory bulbasaur and charmander will come back probably because of the mewtwo and the glitch thing and they will fight the glitch thing. Its called starter squad not squirtle squad
finaly
So two of my predictions were correct. One, there will be starters from other generations and two, at least one of the originals will evolve. Groovy video. See you when the next one comes out
this is the best episode ever
when is the next GODDAMN EPISOOOOODEEEE!!!!!!
Its been 5 years bruce
Wow, just wow. I thought Charmander being the main character of episodes 1-9 would mean he’d make it through to the end. But wow, that’s kind of deep and Squirtle having PTSD and not wanting to evolve was interesting. Kind of made him more human-like despite being a Pokémon.
THEY FINALLY BACK!?   THOUGHT IT WAS CANCELLED FOR GOOD

*Oh my fucking god*

I miss charmander
BRO I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER😯😯😯😯
Wait what when click on accident  but happy I did
Damn shippiddge! I was not ready for any of this, good shit!
2 more episodes left.
This was kinda unexpected 😂
YAAAAAAAASSS
Finally the prophecy is one step to being finish keep going at it and stay filled with the termination because this is awesome
Yes sir
See u again in 2 years for ep 11 maybe
I’ve been watching this series from when I was in 4th grade I’m happy to see this series evolve
IT HAS BEEN LIKE 2 YEARS MAN CONGRATS
bro i was dieing why did it take so long
Omg where u been bro
2 YEARS!
*ITS HERE ITS FINALLY FUCKING HERE!*
Hes back
This was insanely worth the wait. Not only did it deliver on a story and visual level to warrant a year plus on the wait. The entire series from 1-9 was just above an hour in length. This single episode is just under half the length of the entire series till now. The level of effort, detail, and experience put into this project has exponentially increased over time. And I am more than happy to wait 3 years till we get episode 11, and it will be in high def VR 360 video quality.
I really love it 💝
I'm gonna be honest I thought you died
İts been 2 years ı didnt even know it was released ı just search pokemon in youtube and it come out :'D ( Im Dissapointed My Favorites Died Charmander And Fire MONKE)....
That worm doesn’t deserve to wear that on his head
OMG YESS TYSM POGGERS
See you next year
FINALLY MORE STARTER SQUAD! :D
OMG ITS ACTUALLY HERE
In like 1 year
Rip and tear until it is done warturtle
wow i loved this ep cant wait to see the next when i have 2 kids and finsh college
I guess there will be another episode
I WAS WATING FOR THIS MOMENT
This was sad and dark, but the wait was worth it.
Did I really lived that long to be able to see episode 10🥺
I say we need more
Lesgooo new episode
Finnally is out
Well that was unexpected but I love it.
Now wait another 2 years
Let’s goo thank you shippidge
OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG BUT IT WAS SO WORTH IT THANK YOU FOR REALISING EPISODE 10!!! :DDDD
YESSSS ITS HERE ITS FINALLY HERE, HES BACK!!!!
YOOOO THE BEST REIGON
Finalllyyyyyyttt
more
Damn Charmander is dead
Can't wait to see Charmander as a gastly
Yay it released!
Totally worth the wait! :D
Yo this is like the movie and its make me cry
Lets go 2 more to go
Where were you it's been 1 years since you upload a video
That Mewtwo cameo at 12:51 means that he is still fighting missingno after all this time.
Yes!
Yo they really made a Mount Everest Green Boots reference.
Thank you for this moment! I'll always like your vids and your starter squad! 💕👍🍃💧🔥😎
where was the part where itshowed charmander dying
YES!!! Finally!
2 YEARS OF WAITING AND MY MAN charmandar  DIDNT EVEN GET WHAT HE WANTED wtf
Is that it the end?
FINALLY
OMG WARTORTLE..... 👁️👄👁️
My theory for episode 11. I notice that they say that there must be Pokémon gods up there. The only mountain that I strongly believe that wartortle is climbing has to be Mt. Cornet. Because if the gods on the peak, and the purple aura on the peak. What happens next is that wartotle asks for charmander to be alive again.
OMG YES
So Basically... • Charmander Dies • Caterpie Wages A War Against The Predators, But Ends Up Destroying The Viridian Forest & Everyone In It. • Squirtle Then Somehow Gets An Everstone & Reaches Sinnoh.
WHERE IS THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!!!????
NO WAY
AHHHHHHHHH
Episodes would be faster if you had more animators
FINALLY        Oh yeah is it going to take trillions of years to make the next episode
Anyone else see mewtwo trying to kill the glitched hitmonle? 12:51
Time 2 wait another 2 years
Tysm you guys made it
POOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGG
Holy shit it finally came out.
Where the fuck is Charmander
That episode was awesome!  Welp...see you guys in 2025 for the next episode XD lol jk
Charmander should not die😭😭
Omg msb
Ik wartortle is probs gonna ask to bring chimchar back but if he can ask to bring charmander back THAT WOULD BE LEGEND
This whole series is so good this episode is my favorite now
No way!? Charmander...! Noooo! Maybe he'll be back since squir- I mean wartortle "talks" to the god of time or Dialga

Bruh I’ve been waiting so long for this I’ve gotta tell my brother😁
Thank youuu
In those parts where Snover says "There's snow in the way." You really missed the opportunity to say *"There-s-now way."*
The beaver society is perfect.
Pour out some lemonade for all the fallen!
Please upload episode 11
Me after watching this: I WANT GOD LIKE STARTERS HAHAHAHA
Rest in pepperonis char, you lived a good life
Omg yesss
OH YES OH YES OH YES. OH YES
This and Annoying Villagers 63 came out today. It's a fun day so far.
the wait is over!
I wait a year for this is was worth the wait
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo My favorite pokemon
FINALLYYYYY YES IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS
Alright guys, see you again in 3 years!
anjir keren banget cuy
evolving does give a stat buff but this dude just became a greek demigod
So Bulbasaur was dead serious when the caterpie gave him the berries and he said "This is my life, now!"
FINALLY AFTER SO LONG
finally it's here!
FINALLY THE MASTER PIECE IS DONE
Danmmmmmmmm
Omg
i thought i have to wait another 2 years
It’s been a YEAR. But, it’s worth it.
FINNALLY AFTER YEARS!!! THE SERIES RETURNS!!!
Mind blown! Amazing!!!
I hope Bulbasaur is still out there, at least.
Okay, prediction time:  I genuinely don't think Charmander is permadead, he's been a main character since episode 1, and he still had character development left to go through. Plus there's the mess he made that Mewtwo is still trying to fix. To put it simply, Charmander has a lot of unfinished business.  Given how Squirtle/Wartortle appears to be climbing Mt Coronet in this episode (Sinnoh Pokémon, really tall snowy mountain with Arceus supposedly at the top?), my guess is that Episode 11 is going to involve him confronting the gods and getting the chance to go back in time and change the past.  After all, using time travel to change the past, including saving characters that were originally supposed to die, is absolutely a thing that can happen in the Pokémon world.  I predict that Wartortle is going to be sent back to the past, save Charmander, and stop Caterpie's war before it starts.
The wait is over
I feel like Squirtle will meet Dialga and possibly Palkia, which will send him back in time to save Charmander! I also love how when Squirtle was asked what he was going to tell the "gods" he just said "Something" I honestly expected him to say something like, "To go to hell" But what he actually said was so much better because it was kind of funny!
Poor Charmander! He deserved better. That Caterpie is gonna *get it.*
"You're just using me to relive your stupid childhood" Excuse me, CHILDHOOD??? They were CHILDREN??? God, that makes this whole story like 100 times darker.
Omg man im really sad charmander died, and now even chimchar. Although im wondering why he didnt become blastiose if he is level 98? This is amazing tho congrats man the long awaited ep 10 is finally here
Wow he uploaded I thought he was death      Edit: it's a joke btw don't take it seriously
Man I remember literally nothing from before this, but it's cool that this is back.
Teacher: so , what did you grow watching?  Kid1 : Pokémon Kid2 : Beyblade Me : Shippidge
I love u  for the 10th episode but hate u at the same time for killing charmander. Make him return l like evolved into chameleon or smt.
IT'S BEEN A YEAR! FINALLY
I can’t be the only one who was super confused at the beginning man has this series taken a turn
This is by far the best episode in the series in my opinion. It really shows that no matter when something bad happened we have to eventually move on. Good job man!
This was so epic worth the 2 years and tbh it was sad
This is amazing.
I cant believe charmander actually died because he was the main character but i think he would be revived through mewtwo but we dont get to see the main character die so often in some series.thats what makes this series soo fire
Hahahahaha its been a year and mewtwo is still fighting that glitch.
THANK YOU
What it's back? Heck yeah!
This is unexpected best character is ded and squirtel is op and the ugly worm is still alvie
Finaly
What the fuck just happened
Please make meloetta live, she just wants peace so I want her to join squirtle. Please?
Fck charmander died fck fck fkc kfckfikckc
Oh my goodness. It's been years 🥲  The animation and story man... you've grown, just like the turtle buddy here 👏
OMG FINALLY! IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE NEW EPISODE
Have been waiting forever
This show keeps going in such weird directions...
Finally
Anyone notice mewtwo and missing no in some background shots
I'm so surprised this only got 54k views in 3 hours, should've been a million
Was the longggg ass wait worth it ???    Yes yes it was lol, every week I would look on this channel to see if you posted a new episode well I'm lieling  lol not every week like every month for what 2 3 years happy it's back the video was great

This was epic
YESSSSSSSS
Thank you for posting this I was waiting

Finallly
I just woke up so I’m hyped
This is very pog
Damn rip charmander
HES BACK
I lived to see the entire series, I’ve lived a full life WAIT IT AIN’T OVER
Welcome back
Is he going to pull a Kratos?
Wait charmander died!?
HOLT CRAP
Well would ya look at that . . .
So no chamer
"Ten years later"  Yea that's pretty accurate
Wow. I don't know how to put it into words but you changed the direction of the series and it worked. I had my doubts at the beginning of the episode but now I am throughly engaged.
Yees
Wow, now I’ve got to say the obvious, it is a little disheartening that Charmander is gone, but I am not disappointed with the outcome of this episode. After 8 years in the making (quite literally growing up with this series), it really is starting top pay off. Good work man, I’ll see you…. Next year I guess, depending on when the next one comes out
Damn been ages!
After so long it's here
Waited for 2 years ... and I can't believe you really killed Charmander ! :o RIP Lizard :/
This was definitely worth the wait! I can't wait to see what you have plan next.
after 1 year of waiting
wwwwwwwwwwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
There's more to unpack than a giant U-Haul, holy shit!  This long wait was quite worth it, and to see this series evolve from Comedy to Tragedy has been a rollercoaster of massive proportions. Thank you so much and thank you to all the cast and crew. Here's to more Starter Squad moments! It's wonderful to have you back!!
Hold *the* fuk up i was watching anime balls deep (go sub) when i saw this in my recomendend i almost cried man its been so long man my prayers were heard after all 😭😭😭😭🙏
the wait is finally over
That was well worth the wait
I think there will be a time travel or something
WHAT
This is the first time that Bulbasaur and Charmander was not in this episode.
Yes ep 10 has finally arrived
Yes perfect☺️
Sooo nostalgic
finally after a very long time we get ep 10
Good to see Squirtos finally do...something!!!
so sad
I've waited for this so long
After a YEAR it’s finally here yay
Babe, wake up. New starter squad episode just dropped
Han pasado 84 años
After years of waiting i am fully satisfied and can now go to sleep knowing that this series made it to double digits
I fucking love how goddamn sarcastic that Turtwig is.
when the world needed him the most he returns.
Why tf did you just kill off charmander, that’s fucking stupid
So charmanders dead no end of story arc no conclusion God fucking dammit
YOUR CONTENT ARE JUST Cool👍
Episode 1 was seriously 8 years ago? Feels only like last month, the joy of being an og
The legend is BACK!!!
I loved this
Cant beleive it
that monke is beaver racist
Danm I wanted charmander back
Yes
After 2 year of waiting Its Finally Come
Pleasant surprise to hear edatlin 😂 💕
Finaly I've been subbed with notification for a year for this
After 2 years its finally here. The legend is back
THEY KILLED CHARMANDER?!?!! JUST LIKE THAT?!!! WHAAAAAT!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m not a fan the direction this is going, I don’t like the new voice actors’ delivery(specifically Charchar or whatever the poohair is called), and their personalities seem kinda forced(more so the poohair). Squirtle seems the same as ever which is good. Same things apply to the new grass starter(don’t know it’s name), but not to the extreme of poohair
Omg it’s here it’s finally here this is not a drill
I believe in you @Shippiddge, Next episode will air sooner..
Wow my prediction was that Flareon will save charmander, he died huh
This is deep. But amazing.
Wow, now I’m depressed charmander and bulbasaur were my favorite
Ahh Chimchar is sooo annoying😓 anyway, story is too good for a pokemon franchise xD
finally.
God damn it’s sad charmander is gone
When I played the episode I knew charmander was dead but it’s was more heartbreaking to see Caterpea use his head as a HAT.
Bro finally the day has come he posted again
Wartortoile has the coolest fucking voice ever.
You actually made episode 10
This is not the direction I expected it to go but man was it still great, congrats on the release!
So when is episode 11
epic gamer moment
YO YO YOOOOOOO
OH MY GOD!!!
HOLY SHIT THIS IS NOT A DRILL
I guess evolving is like turning super saiyan for squirtle
Really are you kidding the 2 we first start watching are both gone
me waiting my whole life for this just for episode 11
Wow, what a complete change to the formula (I think for the better). All that character development.
nice
DUDE THE EVOLVE SOUNDEFFECT METAL VERSION WAS SO DAMN COOL. Is there some way I can get the sound effect by my self!?
FINALY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Noooooo charmander 😭😭😭😭
Plz make it faster if it's 2 years again I'm gonna fall down stairs
I’ve waited a year for this and I’m glad
FINALLY ITS BEEN 3 YEARS
So when is ep11 lmao
Oh, right, Mewtwo is still fighting Missingno. I wonder how that's going for him.
The new animation style is awesome
i have mixed feelings toward this part 1 very sad but understanding of charmanders death 2 confused and also sad of what happened to bulbasaur  i also have a theory of what squirtle or now wartortle might do 1 he might go back in time to save all of his friends, he might kick some gods ass and force him to help bring everyone back. and my old theory sadly didn’t become a reality which is squirtle throwing the master ball at charmander or the caterpie last second when charmander was about to die.
Finally
this episode was just AMAZING
Finnly
Omg finally I’ve been waiting for a year for this.
I cant belive charmander die...
I THINK ARCEUS IS UP THERE BECAUSE THAT THING WARTOLE FIGHTED SAID A GOD TIME SPACE AND POKEMON
wait its back?????
YESSSSSS
Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Can you release the next 2 episodes next year?
I don't like this I miss Charmander
2 years , they were worth it
Worth the wait! Amazing job man 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
YES ITS FINALLY HERE
This episode is such a chorefest and a borefest to watch I'm consistently rolling my eyes and checking for other videos bc of how boring this garbage episode this is what we have been waiting for a evolution 20 minutes in boring and garbage you gave us five minutes of action and that's it what a snooze fest
I can’t wait till the next one
Hell yeah!! Episode 10! Can't wait to see ep.11-12!
YES YES YES YES YESSSSSSSSSSSSS LETS GOOOOOOOO
No sé nada de inglés pero de todas formas lo voy a ver .voy a esperar a que lo doblen al español.  :v

Episode 12 The Chosen of Pikachu Final Episode
Finallllllllllyyyyy
This is a lot to take in from viridian forest to the sinnoh region in a snap, the death of charmander and I wonder what happened to bulbasuar? I hope the return of bulbasuar and maybe charmander or something in the last 2 episodes, that would be fun to watch
I've waited this for so long omg I hope it's worth it men I love you're video imma do a hashtag for you #shippiddge
FINALLY

Yes another episode after 2 years thank you if you want to count all the episodes last year you can count it but I'll say 2 years
Hes going to the people who made the rules of taking turns during a fight, hard calling it rn.
LETSSS GOO
This release was as inexpected as it was delightful
Only 2 more left
This is why you pick Squirtle, not charmander.
i think ill die before he gets to finish the series
I'm glad this chapter of my childhood hasn't ended yet
AHHHHH ITS OUTTTT
I HAVE WAITED FOR SO LONG THAT I NOW KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE AND IT IS TO WATCH EVERY EPISODE OF THE STARTER SQUAD. This one is really good and it’s surprising how 2 years have passed since episode 9 when it feels like it only released yesterday. 😃😃😃
wow didnt expect these turn of events
So episode 11 in 5 years time Yh?
You killed best charecter in animation😢
Finally the king uploaded
YES
Charmander death broked mee
If this is Watortle's power blastorise is going to a god.
Ok I love that the new episode finally came out but I HATE chimchar he’s trying to be like charmander but he just reminded me of Ava from bl3 and EVERYONE hates her so unless the chimchar acts like that because of some horrid backstory I think I’ll be glad to see it fail no offense to the writers I love they’re content and they’re twitch
me before knowing charmader's death:LETS GOOOO EPISODE 10 me after knowing charmander's death:NOOOOOOOOO
Nooooooooooooo Charmander I swear to the Pokémon gods if when  squirtle meets them and kicks there ass if they don’t bring Charmander back then I hope squirtle captures them and puts them in a pc
Hello brave traveler, I would appreciate a like so I don't get lost in the wave of comments
Finally
omg, lets goooooo
Yesssss
That was amazingly awesomesauce and astonishingly EPIC!! Well done!!!
Damn…..Warturtle is epic
after all these years of waiting
i think blue shell man guy (squirtle) will ask the gods to bring charmander back to life
I'm honestly in ah rn this was a amazing episode and was definitely worth the wait I've been hanging on with ya since episode 1 I'm very happy on how it's going bruh 😁
Man I was waiting for charmander
I really like all the background meta-narratives with the world of Pokémon.  -Red and Blue was released around 1997-1998, and Gen IV Platinum was released about 10 years later. -The Abomasnow calls Arceus with it's Japanese pronunciation (kinda) a-ru-ce-u-su at @16:05, perhaps to emphasize it's 'original' name as a show of greater respect(?) or to make it sound more foreign and mystical. -Squirtle's excuse to not evolve is that holding off on evolution gives him access to more moves like Hydro Pump, but Squirtle doesn't learn any new moves after lvl ∼40 and he was lvl 98 here. Turtwig's 100% right about Squirtle.
yo Squirtle if i was your trainer...things would have been different...better.  I really didn't expect this series to be as good as it is, cant wait for the next episode. P.s Rip my dude Charmander you will be missed.
Is charmander dead or evolve
This is awesome and emotional i cant wait for The next episode
FINALLY
Oh my god fucking love it!
Finalllyyyyyyy episode 10 is out let’s gooo! Btw luv ur vids
omg yes on my birthday
Charmander my boi is gone
I'll see you guys in 4 years.
YEEESSSSSSS ITS HERE!!!!
If you pin this it will take another year to make a new episode
Finally my child hood
The series has gotten really really good
Truly a legend for the ages
I didn’t except  charmander to die and chimchar but new evolution and squirtle I mean war turtle being op I can get behind
snovers are the best part of this episode XD
Charmander would probably kill if the  his evolution was 3
Finally
Om mi gosh
Episode 10 was cool and sad I can't wait I 2 years or 1year for 11 Episode my favorite part was bluey available to save his friend
Will charmander come back
That was incredible!!!!!! See y'all in 2 years!
This series has gone from a normal show to an anime at this point. And I love it
You should complete this for the love of god
Squirtle has freaking PTSD!!!!! Charmander is dead!?!???!
Ep. 1: Man, look at these goofy Kanto starters, aren't they so wacky and uncharacteristic Ep 10: Man, that Squirtle sure does have to deal with the crushing regret and emotional traumas of letting his friend die and committing war crimes and the question of his culpability in the matter. How wacky and uncharacteristic.
Squirrel as the new main character is actually a really good move
OMG... it's been so long... and this was AMAZING!!!!
Also I love the little snowy dudes (I forgot what they’re called 😅)
ITS HEREEE
IVE BEEN WAITING 2 YEARS FOR THIS IM HYPED
30mins 👀💧
I’ve waited so long
Squirtle nooo 😢
Blue Shell Man Guy vs. Actual God
Is charmander really gone………..(please comment shippedge please)
What if Bulbasaur was ontop he didnt die right and he was nowhere to be found ...
CHARMANDER NOOOOOO
Funfact: i do not like bidoof any more
Missing charmander no more interested in another episodes
Holy shit dude… didn’t expect that way for this to go, but I LOVE IT!!! ❤️  I miss bulbasaur tho 🥬
10 minutes into the video and I'm already bored of this lazy good for nothing video this is what we have have been waiting for hug huge huge disappointment garbage video I don't recommend watching this majority of this lazy video is just walking and flashbacks garbage video garbage content creator I won't recommend your channel at all
finally
IT POSTED OMG
Woah this was an Astonishing Episode today The Story, The Flashbacks, The Timeskip, And Everything was Great about this!!! Thank You Shippiddge for this Episode and hopefully we’ll get to see more soon, I mark my Patience for this and the Next one so far.
Charmander didn't deserve to die
It has been 300 years? no it has been 3.000 years
E
finally
its been so long man
every masterpiece has its better fan remake
2 years just to finally know Charmander died
FINNALY,THE DAY WE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR......
Damn. Its here.
pov:the god ganna be arceus palkia dialgha and giratina
WTF THIS BLEW ME AWAY! GJ!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You should make charmader a ghost and the starter squad go back to the haunted house thing
A twist charmander is actually somehow alive (as we haven't seen his death) and bulbusaur also joins when they fight arceus as god
終於阿
I CANT WEIT NEXT EPIZODE
man this was a great episode, can't wait for the...next...episode... great the waiting is back
This series took a SHOCKINGLY dark turn.
I CANT BELIEVE IT ITS FINALLY HERE
After thousands years finally...
Great vid cant wait for the finale
So this went from a simple adventure, into an all-out war against GODS!?! We sure have come a long way.
HYPE
FINALLY
Whattttttttttttttyyyyyyayyyyyyy finallyyyyyyyyy we got it thanks youuuuuu sooooooooo muchhhhh
It’s here!!!!
Finnqly a ep 10
I actually never expected to see the series continue. I'm really liking the new direction.
the wait is over. im happy now
Ok so at first I was upset they wasted all that development on charmander but after watching the whole thing I think it was worth it to prove the theme of that episode. The message being blaming the results of your actions on someone else just because they told you to do it isn’t right plus the snover scenes were all funny. All the characters that seemed wasted were all tools to help squirtle understand his fault in letting others boss him around
When did this become a shonen anime!?
The return of the king
Abomasnow was awesome
Yes I waited like 2 years
Animating is hard that's why we waited so long
FINALLY OMG THIS TOOK WAY TO LONG!1!
THIS WAS SO GOOD MAKE MORE
Wow so I wonder if bulbasaur still alive
It would have been very cool if Arceus showed it's face and said "Alright come at me but first you'll have to face off against the creation trio"
Holy crap it's here!!!!
so what about missingno is it going to returen?
Finally
Alright, did some googling, pokemon red and blue came out in 1998, and then diamond and pearl, the first gen 4 games with those new starters, came out in 2006, eight years later. Platinum, however, came out in 2008, 10 years after red and blue. This is ignoring the months otherwise its not exact I don't think. There's a ten year timeskip in this episode. Giratina confirmed.
Woohoo!!!! The only good Pokemon series I enjoy watching. Way way better than the anime.
Great job the wait was worth it
Come on I want all three episodes why did it take 2 years to upload one episode that’s 26 minutes
I can't believe its been 2 YEARS since the last one. Feels like yesterday.  Excited to see what the conclusion to this near-10 year series will be!

Worth the wait
Finally
FINALLY!!!!!
Love it!
The Return Of The King
When is ep 11?
Now that I am done watching see you guys in the next two years 👍
Aw man charmander died rip the fire starter
Holy crap it happened
its been 2 years...
Time for another year of waiting
I feel like you took the wrong direction, bro why you killed charmander we loved the series because of him and the comedy but you turned it into this cheesy drama
Oml, didn't expect this to make me cry. Well done!
Worth the wait!
Nah charmander died that sux
Worth the wait great work
This is awesome
When I Watched This It Came Out TWO HOURS AGO And Look At It Now Wow This Is The Episode That I Have Been Waiting For Thanks Shipppiddge.
YEET THE WAIT IS OVER!
GUESS WHOS BACK!!!
Squrtile turned into from beta to absolute alpha
Goddamn this could have been the ending of the series and I would've been okay with that
This episode low-key reminds me of the lord of the rings.
OH MY LORD THE WAIT IS FINALLY OVER 17:50 snowgrave
This should be way more popular...
Yaaaaas cheers man!
I’m not sure but i remember reading somewhere that ep 10 is the longest so if that’s true then maybe we just have to wait 1.5 years instead of 2 years
AAAA
Finally after a century he released it
Finally just finally! So happy that u start again! I kinda lost hope. Well i kinda miss charmander but anyway good job <3
Finally episode 10
hes a god
This was an awesome episode, it's the most amazing thing I've seen all day
Oh shit didn’t see this come out
WAIT WHAT
FINALLY! I CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER EPISODE
Let me guess charmander is on the top ? 👁👄👁
FINALLY AND IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT
Talk about a complete 180 from the last episodes, and squrtal being completely broken and finally standing up for himself was great  Can the grass type pokemon please get some love in this series, because so far they are either a blind follower or a road block. Think about it, Bulbasaur just blindly followed charmander and the only thing we really learned about him is that he is addicted to poison damage, we don't even know if he is still alive after the war. Weepenbell was an annoying road block that was full of himself and was rightfully killed by charmander. Turtwig was in this episode for about 10 minutes and was never called by his name before leaving. Snowrunt was just an annoying side character and abomasnow was literally a road block. Not to mention the fire starters are literally clones of each other and what happened to piplup, is he not in this story. All I want is more love for grass and fire types, but aside from that keep up the great work.
Nooooooooooooooooo why did charmander have to die nooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm just mainly mad that Charmander died. But the series is back so yay.
Omg that's was amazing and btw congrats on making so 10
finally episode 10
OH MY GOD. THAT WAS SO EPIK            SOMETHING.
Holy shiiiiiiiiit
It was finally came after 2 years of waiting
Finally it's been a year!
I've seen some people guess that Squirtle (Wartortle now I guess) will use Dialga to go back in time to make things right, but I'm going to instead make the out-there, completely crackheaded guess that Squirtle will best the gods and force them to remake the world based on true teamwork and equality, rather than one team leader barking orders.  And then we get the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon universe out of it.
damn this is just sad lol
Damn, to realise Charmander really died is a bummer..
I miss Charmaine
So glad this is back. I’ve missed this series!
This took 2 years
12:51 ....whats this! Mewtwo fighting a glitched thing? Is that hitmon chan?
Just like Charmander said:      "Too much for character development."        R.I.P. Charmander.
FINALLY
Finally the wait is over, the episode 10 we are waiting for so long is here, thank you 😊
Yes
YESSSSSS FINALLY EP10
Ok I hate caterpie now as soon as I saw the head of Charmander
ITS HERREEEE
Wait ... What??? That was unexpected
I refuse to accept the fact that the best characters charmander and the newly introduced chim-char are dead. I was In hope for seeing the starter trio back together fighting the caterpie army and other pokemon. Nope. Just skip 10 years and the two funniest starters in this series is dead, squrtle sucks but now he just stronger, and I didn't laugh once. Don't get me wrong the episode was great seeing the improvement in animation and i understand the point the story is telling and how the death of charmander and Bulbasaur still affects squirtle and just the whole vibe change of the story. BUT DAMN MAN WHY THEY HAD TO HAVE HIS HEAD AS A HAT, EVERYTIME IT WAS ON SCREEN IT WAS THE ONLY THING I LOOKED AT.
yesssssss
Wow mewtwo is still fighting after all this episodes
This has been in the making of a long time this was so good
And Yeah... Finally Charmander death And Broke His Promise To Mewtwo,Then I am So sad Because Charmander Death. Why Must Charmander?  :')
Finally it came out
After i just watched over the series its finally here
Kinda miss the main character already.
yay!! 2 more left!
WhA
noooo i need more
ok catherpy is definitly my least favorite pokemon
THNX FOR EPISODE TEN I SUBSCRIBE NOW
Shippiddge am finally came back for not long and it was over and massive of creation to look amazing please give me a shoutout
Ah finally
Oooooh im gona watch it like you don't have idea!!
And Wing the whole year for this about freaking time I'm so ready for this
ITS BACK
Can’t believe charmamder is actually dead I thought he would evolve right when he got stabbed
finnaly ep 10 after so long
finally
finally yay
See you guys in a year
BROOOOO HE EVOLE WHAT GODDS WTFFF
God of war 2018: blue turtle guy edition
Bro that was good. I can't wait for the next episode
So now he's actually dead. Wow this series has gone dark holy
Can you really even call it starter squad cuz the rest of it is just about Squirtle on his own half the time
XD
while this episode was amazing, can i just say that Big Bibby is such a damn mood?
When is ep 11 coming out???
Snover: so what are you gonna ask them??? Wartortle: ...somethin Best line in the whole series
ITS FINALLY HERE
wasted potential for squirtle and or bulbasuar tbh squirtle could've saved charmander by water gunning caterpie
Water going to make all the monkey come back alive fight all the god
Pokemon legends arceus? Pfft who needs that we have the legend of the blue shell man guy
Oh my...Fucking God...
Makeup tell me Charmander going to be a life and Charmander going to be alive
I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!!!!!!!
Wait... there two more vids right? Episode 11 and 12... The gods
Yesss Yesssssss Yesssssss!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
I love seeing Squirtle embrace what he learned from Charmander instead of just dismissing it as being wrong like he has been doing throughout the whole series. Granted, Charmander was incredibly violent which makes it hard to understand him, but Squirtle finally understands the ideology that motivated his deceased friend. Seeing him evolve cause of this realization is so cathartic and somber at the same time. I love the direction.
That would have made the house quality Bob at the moment you got to die Rhonda listen to audition
I though squirrel died in chapter 9
Snover is my favorite character
Charmander died noooooooooooo
That's a shame i kept getting excited every time it seemed like squirtle died.
finally episode 10 came after a yaer
can you bring back charmader as charzird
Cool episode, see you in 2 years
A part 10 without big I want fighting playthrough part 11
Don't want to sound like a jerk but.......... finally we got another episode!!!!! 😁 i love fan base series like this. Keep it up
EPISODE 10?! BUT IM TRYING TO WORK. BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
12:50
This is an awesome advert for the Sinnoh Remakes.
Alright, see y’all in 2 years!
Rip charmander
Less gooo I was waiting for ever
worth the wait
Is charmander dead.....
I thought this would be here at December
I have been a fan for about 4 years! And still am Thanks for uploading the new episode it was sad but amazing! Keep it up ☺️!
As an og, this has been a very very long haul, congrats on the 10th episode
I cannot believe it is here.
YESSSSSSSS
Theory wartortle later soon as blastoise will go back in time and start over
OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD
Me seeing the video:oh he try too get clout Me seeing who uploaded it:OH SHIIIIT OH SHIT
U took ages to make this so vidio is ages long
Noob
Today is my birthday and this was the best gift so far  Thank you 💝
Lvl 98 has its strengths,my guy evolved to become god
Make a part 14 pls
2 years after ep 9 ep 10 finally came out
My honest reaction to everything here: “…Ho-ly Fuck…” This was amazing Shippiddge! I can’t believe it happened how it happened. And just how gone “he” was. Keep up the excellent work! I just have 2 Questions, that I hope you can answer:  1) Like a year or 2 ago, you had a video (with only Charmander and Bulbasaur in it with Squirtle “missing”, hmmmmmmmm) that said there will be 12 Episodes of this series. Is that still the plan? Or is it more or less now?  2) Why was Squirtle wearing an Everstone? I know he was not as pushy to evolve and get stronger like Charmander, but he still thought evolution and getting stronger was good. Maybe I’m missing something, but I don’t remember him being “anti-evolution”.  No matter what happens now, keep up the godly work man!
Now another 2 year of waiting for episode 11
similar feeling with kratos man, i like the episodes should make another series out of this
12:50 O.O
So in an effort to go save their friend, charmander died and bulbasaur was enslaved, and squirtle didn't even want to go. Damn.
Ngl gave me some God of war vibes
Wartortle: "Who are they to decide that?!"   Me: Dude Wartortle is going all Escanor 😂😂😁😁😎😎😎
This is epic. I love it
Nope 2 years from the eps 10
The little tree dude had me dying!
will there be ep 11?
Charmendeeeeeeeeer T.T
that was awesome!
Holy F#cking sh#t
O
Can you change the story that charmander and bulbasaur is alive.
BRO THIS IS LIKE A HOLE ANIME
yes finally
"Being slightly bigger changes nothing" that one got me Soo badly 😂😂
I’m sad that you haven’t even posted another one of these in a year
Ten years later or 2 years later?
TOOKEN SO LONG

Thank you so much for this episode.  This was truly a great one.  You've all worked so hard for this and we truly appreciate it.  🙏🏿 If more is to come let it be when you're ready.  Thank you again.  😊

YAYAYAYYZAYAYXS8W
Why did charmander have to die
This was the most bad ass episode yet (and it was like an arc of a character)
it's so fucking awesome to see my man evolve!the way how hes sad shows his anger!I love it!!
LETS GOOO ITS FINALLY OUT ARTER 10 YEARS!
And that's how Charizard never made it and Bulbasaur was fed food and also Squirtle you are freaking traitor
That moment when I pressed the like button before watching the video. Hahaha thats how muxh I love your creations!
Wake up. He has arrived.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. OMG OMG OMG OMG ITS HERE I FEEL LIKE MY PARENTS LOV EME AGAIN OMG
THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE BIN WAITING FOR SO LONG
YAYYY
Didn’t know you could make Abomasnow creepy
It’s finally out
wait Charmander is dead dead?
i remember when i was like 8 and started this series and here I'm now
Finnaly a new episode
WOOOO LETS GO
It's finally time!   Man that went to some dark places but it was well worth the wait. Love how the series basically matured with the creator 🤣
Oh shit! I didn’t realize this episode was being released, can’t wait to watch!!!
This is worth the wait! I am excited for the next episode!!
O M G
Yessss finally fuck you slow poke
Now we wait another two years
"Squirtle, now that you are the high level of 98, perhaps you should save the last two levels for evolution"
Yea! It's about time I was waiting for so long for this episode to come out.
When's the next episode coming?
This is like my dad leaving me but this time he came back
Can’t wait to watch this!
Good bye charmander 🪦🥀
rip charmander
YOURE TELLING ME I WAITED 3 YEARS FOR THE CONCLUSION OF A CLIFFHANGER AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS? It’s a good episode but cmon I’m sad now AND THERES ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER
Although the series has developed over the years to be a more serialized drama, I'm glad that it still has some elements of a cartoon comedy in it, like with the x-eyes and the dialogue between the Snovers. They were the highlight for me in this episode.
It finally here
When the world needed him the most  He left... Then He Returned FROM THE DEAD!
fantastic episode
A whole episode without a single stupid that came out of Bulbasaurs mouth??                     *Sad Bulbasaur sounds*
Aight see ya i. Late 2022 or 2023😃😃
Another classic returns.
I think the pokemon gods will bring back chimchar and charmender.
I hope a new episode comes soon
Thank you for bringing us another amazing episode! The wait was totally worth it! Keep up the great work! It's too bad that Charmander died last episode. Hopefully he'll find peace in the afterlife. Can't wait to see future episodes! Stay awesome! Best of luck with everything! Take care!
Part 11 plzzzz
IM SO HAPPY FINALLY
After two year
Yay
Man the new god of war looks lit
OMG THE ANIMATION KING IS HERE!
Charmander and bulbasaur will come back right?...RIGHT!?
AFTER 1 FRICKING YEARS IS FINALLY HERE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Finally! Some Wartortle love 🥰🥰🥰 Hope he stays this way
What come next
😯
Yes it’s out
Keep up that great work! I can wait a year or 2 for episode 11.
its been years...
My god
No I can't believe charmander is dead 😭
That was awesome   Hopefully they will either reverse Charmanders death or bring him back cause they still need to take on Missing No
When will wartortle evolve into BLASTOIS.
No.. I love charmander, and i want him to be better pokemon and finally evolve, not only be stronger, but also be a nice pokemon,         Also, on the scene where caterpie regret everything, i cant stop say "you got what you fuckin deserve"
I think ep 11 Wartortle asks the god pokemon to bring back charmender and chimchar back to life
DAM FINNALY
Wow you made a (7+) year old show a (16+)year old show xd good for you.
GREG?! I knew those Bidoof's sounded familiar, so happy to hear his voice again! Been way too long.
After a year of waiting its here. Omg
After all the episodes charmander died... Thats really depressing i thought he would evolve and kill the caterpies
There are adults here (18) who started watching when they were 10. That's an insane thought.
FINALY AFTER YEARS AND YEARS and at my birthday ahahah
Bruh this is like 3-5 yrs late lol.
Pleas make a part eleven because number ten was so 😎
What the fudge?! Christmas came early!!! I thought this series was slyly cancelled, so hype to see it return in all its glory!

Wait so charmander died?
Will there be an 11th episode??
Finnaly another starter suad episode
Yes finely more
So are you gonna try to release the final 2 episodes as fast as possible or we are LITERALLY gonna have to wait 2 years again?
Ed Atlin as Snover was fucking hilarious
What an incredible change of tone, this amazing episode has completely evolved the premise of Starter Squad; just like squirtle did himself! Did not expect it to go as far as sinnoh, but man you have my utmost respect for completely changing the game here Shippidge, even if that means killing off beloved charmander.(I hope he is somehow revived and returns though) You're doing God's work, keep it up for the next few years!!  RIP CHARMANDER (2014 - 2021) THE LIZARD WILL BE MISSED
Well that made me cry a little
Yahhhgh!!!
Rest In Peace Charmander :(
(Ep.11 )
Squritle: king of projection
Great episode, see you in 2023
nooo charmandeeer.... I personally wish he hadn't died.
nonono i can’t believe it omg i’m so ready
Like literally finally this video came out
Big snow guy: what the fu- the game : this Pokemon has just defeated a god.
I got a heart attack when I saw ep 10 thumbnail!!
really well done.loved it. keep it up will be waiting for the next episode
Yesssss finally
LETS GOOOO
Shh don’t read the Comments just yet it’s Spoilers!!! If you want to spoil yourself I guess…
I can’t believe it fondly uploaded 🎉🎉🎉
YES IT'S  HERE NO SPOILERS HERE
Yessssz
Omg finnaly
FINALLY!!
What happened to bulbasaur and charmander.
Im pretty sure shippidge's ghost uploaded this by accident
I’m honestly so disappointed i waited so long for this and the reason i fell in love with series was changed. Charmander being dead and not being featured is a big mistake and let’s be real they were never meant to evolve they should have stayed prevolves. this episode should have began with mewto saving charmander and then stopping the glitch.  what’s even more depressing is to have to wait two years for a bit of closure
finally
What will happen next with wartirtel we might find out next time
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FINALLY
Will charmander or bulbsaur return
Well its kinda sad that charmander died
Pls make more
YOO NO WAY
ok .. i am totally speechless..
But I like how Squirtle became a god
Yay
It’s a great day to be a Squirtle fan.

Ugh finally I was getting tired of waiting

OMG
Beautiful episode! Glad to see your doing well!

Finally
I wish they got a potion and revived Charmander
LETS GO ITS HERE
I love how Catepie's hat said shouri (win in japanese)
FINNALY
the work paid of my man, keep it up at your own pace
Quality series. It is like 1 episode per year. But with golden quality.
How Long The Video Actually Is: 28mins How The Video Feels Like: 1mins
Saving this for tonight...get the excitement flowing
Now to wait 2 years for the next ep
Worth the wait, amazing episode, rest in peace charmander, see you in 3 years for episode 11 :D
the king is back
Man, after sooo long is finally here! Hell yeah!
Nani
i have been waiting 2 years for this
Damn
Mans straight up made a 1 hour and 30 minute animated movie.
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!  I FRIKIN LOVR THIS SERIES !!! AND WAITING PATIENTLY FOR OTHER HIS WAS SOO WORTH IT !!CONGRATS ON EP10 AND THANKS FOR MAKING MY DAY
0:20 Oh GODS, not a decade long timeskip! My only weakness! 6:09 I'M A BIIIIIRD! TWEET TWEET! 6:17 BIRD SOUNDS! Bird sounds come out of me! THEY DO! 11:03 don't take it personally... 12:51 This is why I hate long time skips like this! SO MUCH is left untold! How has missingno not ended the world? Why didn't Mewtwo come back and chastise anyone? 15:24 A goody, a holier-than-thou type personality. 17:49 Aw man, not again! Oh well. At least this one didn't tease us with character growth, first. 20:17 It's far too late for that now. 21:08 You got some character growth, too. Is nice. 21:51 This line is important. It may seem easier to be a puppet to someone else, to have the burden of choice removed and to FEEL like nothing you do is your fault. But that's not how it works, EVERYTHING is a choice, even obedience. 22:37 Your gods aren't coming to save you. The fealty you've pledged to them has earned you no favor. How could you be worthy of divine intervention? You're a killer. 24:09 So we're just completely leaving the Missingno thing up to Mewtwo? Dissatisfaction.
I see this series that I was a kid :D
let me guess he's gonna turn into war turtle I guess not I guess yes
I miss charmander  :( ( idk if I spelt it right)
More
Wait this thing IS STILL GOING ON?
Top 10 anime comebacks.
Dang that was a fucking good episode thank you shipp =)
I been waiting my whole life for this
Awesome episode! Wartortle gave me Kratos feelings
YES YES YES YES (when charmander died) NO NO NO NO
dang charmanders dead huh
it would be cool if there was a gardevoir came and let wartortle revivehis odd freinds and evolve them
Yes
YES
It took em 8 fucking years to evolve
this is gonna be so sad when it ends just another amazing 12 ep anime with no season 2 lls
A historic moment by Shippidge, EP 10 finally released after so long
The way he never gives up is amazing

Finnaly
The many year waits is over 2 more
Finnsly

Getting God of war vibes here... is it because of the name WARturtle?  Lol
No way  😳
Can't wait for the next ep
Finally after all those years
Caterbich: Lizard is a monster! He killed dozens of caterpies and members of other species Also caterbich: *commits genocides on multiple species and causes the extinction of her own species while killing her own allies when they turn against her*
Only 2 more years left or more.
I just realized squirtle calls him char   not as in chimCHAR     but as CHARmander because he doenst know turtwig's name so why would he know chimchar's?
I've been waiting a year but it's worth it
Aru ce u su … haha please don’t tell me this is over I need this in my life please
RIP charmander
I really miss charmander tho
Snover!!!! yes!
the wait was ABSOLUTELY worth it (as always)!!! I’m shivering in my timber’s for the next ones!
Finally after monthes
GOOD ENDING=Charmander Dies but turns into a ghastly and live happily ever after
Don't worry turtwig I love you ❤
Finally! Can't believe I've been chasing after a pokemon drama back for 10 years already... This is incredible
I believe Squirtle is gonna find Dialga and Palkia, and will go back in time to save Charmander and bulbasaur, since he is regretting all of his choice, I can't believe the starter squad will end without bulbasaur and Charmander SO GIMME BACK CHARMANDER
Seasone 2 anyone
That was totally worth the wait! Awesomely epic video man! 😎👍👍 Though it's devastating that Charmander is officially dead, I mean I thought he would miraculously survive or something, but I guess not. Still an amazing episode.
Wow feels like a whole new series but it's now more epic like Dbz epic let's hope this momentum continures.....still it's sad everyone's Gone Charmander Bulbasaur......Damn
I have a theory one Wartortle kills a God will  restart the universe
soooooooooooooo long
Omg this took forever I don’t care though you are amazing
This went from a dumb project to the best shonen in history and i love every second of it.
Off so early
YESSSSS FINALLLYYYYYYY

It's here...it here...
3:54 Turtwig: But he's a Level 98!  Me: wait, why he didn't evolves before? hold up he did evolves when he battling abomasnow.

And this thook him only 2 years.........
Oh jeez this just got darker
Can he get saved my like somthing
12:51 Mewtwo fighting a what?
Squirtle before is a normal pokemon and became a loyal soldier with no mind and now he became wartortle wich is so strong that he became as strong as his mega actualy i think the next episode will be epic
So Squirtle/Watortle gonna fight gods??? It's reminds me to a certain bald dude with anger and family issues from a small indie game called God of War
It’s kinda my fav pokemon
arceus 😏
Ep 10. Is amazing
What a slowpoke

Omg this took forever

I wonder what will happen………………………………….. next?

So hyped for a new episode after following this for years, but totally wasn't expecting a "(Poke)Man vs God" scenario to play out lmao
LETS GOOOOO!!!
i was waiting for this for soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long
Poor two chars
Same time next year?
yay now we wait 1000 more years for (ep 11)
OMG
Damn, knowing Charmander actually died in the last episode… episode 9 really hits different now that I’ve seen this. Charmander getting water gunned within an inch of his life by the person he wanted to save, who didn’t even know that he was trying to save him, and then being killed the same way he killed the first caterpie that started it all… that’s dark
Nice
AWESOME!!!!!!
FINALLY EP 10
Finally after a year ITS HERE
Damn when I watched episode 1 I was 8 now I am 15
Who’s else was watching this since the beginning over the years?
I was wondering when this would come out just a little bit ago
Finally we will know what is going with charmander this is the best fan made series of pokemon That I have ever seen. I know this series because of the hebrew dubbing i seen the 3 episodes in hebrew and i continue in the english dubbing.  ♥
YES,YES,YES!
Squritle starting to turn in to Kratos and Azura.
Very bold continuation of the story, but a decision I can respect. Kinda sad that we didn't get to see everything that went down after the 9 episode build-up, but who knows what the future brings. This episode was different, but still very good tho! Gotta stick around for episode 11, thank you and everyone for making this. It is awesome and I appreciate the hard work that went into it :)
LETS GO FINALLY
Yay im so excited
Its hard to come up with something to say sometimes. However, the main point is that I enjoyed this very very much! Y’all are incredible!
I'm sorry but I've been a fan of this series for years and I must say I'm disappointed. The animation looks amazing and it's great seeing Squirtle again but knowing that Charmander is not only dead but also seeing his head on that bugs head I'm sorry but that ruined it for me. He was not only my favorite Pokémon growing up but also in the series. I woke up at 4 am to watch this and I can't sleep knowing that happen but I however wish you and the best of luck with the series but I can't watch this knowing my favorite character is gone
It’s been 2 years
UR DA BEST BRO EVEN IT TAKES A YEAR ITS SO GOOD
😎SUPER DOPE EPISODE😎 thank you!

YES FINALLY and this is season 2 basically
This series is better than the Pokémon anime
Finally...after 1 year...
I see were is this story is going to; or squirtle will kill every god-like lengendary pokemon to become the next arceus, or squirtle will ask for god to make everything like it once was.

Oooooo men
After year of waiting
FINNALY
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooòoooooooooooh yeah
I'm sad that Charmander is gone but at the same time that's some good character development for squirtle
There is a universe worth of difference between this episode and the very first Starter Squad, it's insane and amazing how this hilarious series has evolved into something that feels so epic, bravo indeed
Finnaly ep 10
Wow this was a nice surprise in my recommended. Forgot this existed to be honest Really good as always and I’m excited for the last two projects!
This was a fucking doozy of an episode. Jesus this was sad

Will charmander ever come back
Wait when is the next episode I need to know
YES ITS HEREEEEEEEEEEE
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS

Damn so homicidal Char croaked never thought the series would ever come to that. Gonna miss that completely insane guy.
Finnaly its here
This is like sad story to anime IT SO MMMMMMEEEEEEENNNNNNAAAAAACCCCCCIIIIINNNNGGGG
I’d find it hilarious if in the next episode, Wartortle coughs and goes back to the voice he had as Squirtle, saying that voice is hell on his throat.  (But would also be fine if he keeps the deep voice since it’s cool)
OMG ITS HAPPENING DONT PANIC IM PANICING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Amazing episode!!
After waiting for over 2 years..it’s here : )
I watched it in the first minute of it being up on yt the wait is finally over!
I was so long waiting.
THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST COMEBACK SINCE AVENGERS ENDGAME
Finally
Charmander nooo
Wow! With every episode You always leave me with confidence that the anticipation was well worth it. I love the story, and genuinely didn't expect what You'd do with it after the previous episode. Moreover, it's a joy to see how with every episode the quality of the animation increases. Thank You for this amazing experience, and the tremendous work You put into the whole series!
He going to find Arceus on top of the mountain
OH MY GOD
Need to finish this series  Also Wartortle was so op
I waited so long for this…
Yes finally it took a year
incredible
I knew charmander died
Finally
This was so awesome
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
FINALLYYYYYYYYYY
Aah finally, now i can go back to my hibernation to wait for the next episode.👋
Love the new episode... I wonder what happened to Bublasaur though?
Well, we won’t get another episode for a while but…..I feel okay knowing we at least got another, knowing he’s not gone
Based on the title does that mean…        That random blue thing holding a shell gets to have an episode?
Man, the storyline is 👌.
Wartortle is giving me Kratos vibes but his voice is giving me Piccolo vibes. Holy hell though, this episode was LEGENDARY! Completely did not Charmander to have died and have his cut off as Caterpie wears it.
OmGg
Finally!
Finally
I cant wait to see more of the past
2 more episodes!
Woo
can't wait for ep 11 in 2023
Man that went from 0 to 100 real fuggin quick, that's a 10 from me on episode 10
YESS FINALLY NEW EPISODE 😫
Solid episode. I'm missing Charmander though:(
YESSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE FOREVER
Also rip charmander and bulbasaur
I waited 2 years for this
Alright another 1 year for another episode.
Is it time travel time
Holly but there’s two more right? Pls there’s gotta be
So excited. Thank you.
HE'S BACK
At 11:51 in the video mew-two plus something else
Dam charmander rip
Just came out of work and saw this post. I just nutted
Wow! That was so powerful! Definitely worth the wait!
FINALLY
Squirtle just evolved in to kratos
Well, see yall in another ten years.  But in all seriousness, this was a really great episode. Great work
From what I have seen, the plot is going to have time travel. The fact that Abomasnow mentioned how Arceus is the God of space and time, how we had a long period throughout the show where there was no Squirtle and we got to see Bulbasaur and Charmander grow as characters in that time makes me feel like it is going to be the three reunited stronger in their friendship and stronger as individuals for the next part of the plot. That is just my opinion of course.
Well worth the wait, honestly this was a really good episode, and shows off a ton of the character development (obvisouly not spoiling this one bit). Looking forward to the final two episodes. You really have done a wonderful job here Shippiddge, every episode is worth it's weight in gold.
Really sad to see the end of my favorite character Charmander, but it was in the name of great cinema. Seeing Charmander's death change Squirtle's character in so many ways really changes this whole series. Starting from the first episode of Squirtle's tensions with Charmander and being a total geek, Squirtle is just a geek with loss and wanting to try again to fix his mistakes that he couldn't fix before. I can't wait for the next episode, amazing story.
An amazing video, I am glad your back.
So sad. i wanted the fire pokemon to live the most.
Been waiting for long time and each second past until now, is totally worth
FInAlLy
bruh i cant believe charmander died and they just did a 10 year timeskip...
OMFG
Yes the king is back😱
It really sucks that Charmander died. We all felt that….
another masterpiece crafted to perfection and totally worth the wait. And now we look forward to the next year or so. Honestly  I was though this to be the last episode to a great series.
I waited years you did well
Did slow go finally make it
Yeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssss finally hahahahhahahah
My guess for episode 11, he meets Arceus and the trio (Palkia, Dialga, Giratina). Negotiates with Dialga to turn back time to do things right.
2 more épisodes......
This so good. No more wait.
Also I left for a good few hours replaying the I'm a bird scene over and over again
Finely starred quad ten it has been years
Snover=uncle Roger?
I don't need to worry about evolution moves and stuff, I have my TMs all locked in. I know what I'm doing....I might have forced my Growlithe to evolve too soon
Bravo !
Guess who's back♪
Wow this episode was such bad ass the plot for this episode was soo good the graphics where excellent I love it how there was flashback giving what happen after episode 9 plus the evolution was sick. Thanks for making this series as it reminds me how much I love pokemon.  2 episode left.
Damn...did charmader really died?
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy it=s baclk
At 12:47 I forgot the glitch creature existed.
RIP charmander
Finally 🥰😍😍😍😍
Frickin pog
Bruh I literally cried when I saw charmander head got ripped off😭😭😭
This episode basically killed everyone else we've known for years
The last one was 2 years ago
I am so sad charmender is dead
Why do u killl charmender why 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bring back Charmander
after watching this video, i feel disappointed because the story didn't live up to my expectations, i think charmander will evolve and slaughter all the remaining caterpies and continue his journey with bulbasaur and squirtle
https://youtu.be/knmguftL4ac I don’t want to wait 1 more year!
Amazing! Thank you guys for making this series :'D
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CHARMANDER!!!!!!!

IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS
So... Charmander is dead and bulbasaur's end his life  Squirtle have a new "team" and he finally evolved  Also Mewtwo still fight the missing no...... It's not that i thought but hey  Stills good
This was well worth the wait.
Two left
NO WAY
What a twist! Love it!
Where is Charmander
So charmander is dead... stuff is going down.
That was so good
Amazing video !  the animation was spot-on fantastic !   i wonder if wartortle will ask to go back in time or something ?? also mewtwo was fighting missing no. in one of the flashbacks !
HOLY SHITTTT IT'S FINALY HERE
Lovely
The lenged is back
Damn I was expecting Blastoise! Jk it's amazing!!
So in the end, Charmander "broke" Mewtwos promise to meet him in Cerulean Cave.... and no word on what happened with Bulbasaur either 😩  I have a feeling Dialga will send Squirtle/Wartortle back in time to prevent the atrocities committed by Charmander and Caterpie.
now we just have to wait for another 4 years for the series finale
Just woke up first thing I’m doing is watching this
Where Bulbasaur go?
I got surprised, and then said.  "Is this it? Is this Finally it? YOOOOOOOOOOO"
Can the next video will be another Charmander evolve into a charzar getting revenge on the worms

Nicely done here
Could someone bring a flashlight it's too dark in here
Let’s go!
I'm here and it just got released an hour ago and the current time is 12:18 am
I bet nobody prees on this cus they thought this was fake cus shippige a teas trailer mean that it goin6to come out 2 year later
thank you.
There's no connection with ep 9 stupid
Hmm is kinda weird because he choose gen 4 is probably because of dialga is on gen 4 and can time travel so maybe charmander dying is not the end i can see is gen 4 because of chimchar and turtwig. Also abomasnow say that he kill pokemon that try to climb the mountain because of the gods so maybe dialga,palkia and giratina Will be the gods and squirtle going to fight all three of then so can bring back charmander and chimchar so it can have an happy ending andis kinda sad because this Will get a lot of hate probably because of charmander dying let's see what he can bring in three more episode or maybe a seoson 2 this is only a theory
That was intense and surprisingly unexpected. Well done!
were is charmander and bulbasaur
AMAZING!!
I really hope they start uploading more!
This series is such top teir quality, amazing!! Bravo, bravo 👏👏👏👏
dang it have to wait 129319239 years for the next episode
I would just like to thank you for continuing the series after all these years.
Let’s go
I love how edgy he became
12:50 😉
Finally xD
Heys back
I've been waiting for this to get released for ages!!!!!!!!
brillaint idea to make wortortles aura a water refelective mahigy
rip bolebeswor
New episode
We all waited for for too long that we forgot about it
Yesssss! You’re amazing I love these.
Nooooooo charmander
THE 2 YEAR WAIT IS FINALLY OVER
That was... A lot. To take in. Charmander's death, the war and seeing how pathetic squirtle was broke me. He treated everything as a everyday adventure. Because that was all he had before he lost it all. Caterpie finally understanding that he's in the wrong was...sudden. And bulbasaur choosing to be food and eating fruits his entire life is messed up to say the least, but it fits him. Also Shippiddge has no mercy on killing characters off whenever he wants like god damn, but that's how real life is, you dont get anime miracles, you die. Doesnt matter if it's sudden, or anti-climatic. Life isnt a movie. It's cruel and horrifying, that's why i dont think charmander's going to be revived. If he did then that ruins the whole point of the episode. And caterpie wasn't killed or anything even after all they've done, is unsatisfying but that's also how real life is, bad guys dont get what they deserve most of the time and it's infuriating. What a crazy episode. Shame we dont get to hear shippiddge's iconic voice anymore. Edit: Guys, get over it. Charmander's dead. Deal with it.
12:48 did anyone else see mewtwo?
Its here people
Watching this makes me miss charmander and bulbasaur
Lets goo! It's been 2 years, but it's finally here.
Finally the pokemon series we all wanted is back.
Sad that Charmander really died because he was just trying to save Squirtle and Squirtle wouldn't let him talk long enough to say that he was there to save him and not level up.  I wonder if Squirtle ever found out what they were really there for and felt bad.  Maybe Bulbasaur told him?
Nooooooo charmander NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO pls make palkia and dialga help squirtle to save charmander Pls cause it makes sense
Finally
It's worth it
Finally part 10
is wartortle gonna ask for charmander back?
It's finally here
Bro, been here since episode 1. It’s literally a treat when you drop these and they ALWAYS get better. I haven’t even watched the video yet and I already know its fire!!!
Cool
I wiss I could say i feel bad for chimhar but he killed himself, turtwig tho, I can't blame him for leaving.
I genuinely adored this episode,such a damn surprising transition of Protagonists and just general Tone as a whole--it's really embraced being more than just a Comedy.  Really looking forward to this undertaking going further,take all the time needed! -even if it takes another couple years lol-
RIP Charmander
Finally! Wooooo!
Hmmmmmmmm. Are the pokemon gods mewtwo mew, or arceus? Comment below what u think!
i have been waiting for this episode for one freaking year!!!!!! THESE VIDEOS ARE BETTER THAN THE REAL POKEMON ONES!!!!!!!😍😍😍
Finally it's been an eternity
FINALLY YESSS
Now pain and torture until the next episode      No rush by the way
I can’t wait to see episode eleven… in twenty years!
Finally
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like the would Pokemon god would be mewtoo and he gives him the chance to save either Chim or charmander
Whats gonna happen to the other two characters
The time has come, time to enjoy this new episode 😊
I’M A BIRD!!!!! BIRD SOUNDS COME OUT OF ME!!!!! BIRD!!!!
So Starter Squad No longer for Kanto Starters anymore
finally its here
finnaly
Is charmander dead
That was a brilliant episode! Thank you all for the hard work that you put in. Congratulations on the release of Episode 10!
IM SO GASSED!!!!!!
Please tell me episode 11 is coming sooner than we expect?! 😭
DUDE WHAT DID YOU DO ITS NOT THE SAME I DON’T LiKE IT
I hat you charmander is my favorite pokemon
Holly cow this was worth the wait
LETS FUCKING GO
OMG CHARMANDER ACTUALLY DIED!?!?!!? QOQ But OH MAN this episode was AMAZING!!! Level 98 Squirtle LMAO but now a level 99 Wartortle!! I love Wartortle's design, it's pretty amazing, one of the best designed middle evolutions definitely. I didn't expect Squirtle to end up being the new protagonist, but okay! The Squirtle line needs more attention and love, everyone seems to either pick Charmander coz it's cool or Bulbasaur coz it's useful, while Squirtle is replacable by all the many other Water types. Despite having a feeling Charmander might have died, I'm actually really shocked that he really died. But I have a feeling Squir- I mean, Wartortle, might do something about that. And maybe Chimchar too. I love anarchist Chimchar, that's amazing. XD WORTH THE WAIT FOR THIS EPISODE!!! Very excited for episode 11!!! You guys rock!
Let’s go!
My heart dropped seeing charmanders head
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow......this is so  COOL!
What happened to whiskers tho?
if this took so long i literally cant wait for episode 11
I’m honestly shocked they killed Charmander
I really thought charmander was the main character
Who else is hoping for this series to end before we die of age BTW good story telling tho
Such an episode really needed to wait
You know now that we're at the end, I gotta ask what's next?
I'm sad for  camander😭
FINNALY!!
LETSS GOOOO ITS OUT!!! HYPEE
Woah… I’m happy now!
Omg.its here.wow.
BRUH FINALLY YAYYAYAYYAYAYYAYAY
Let’s go :)
This actually made me cry
wow I actually cant believe it was 2 years ago I last saw an episode of this. that was actually amazing!
I grew up with this series, can't believe it's been 8 whole years man... yikes, that's literally half of my life lol
Finally episode 10 is here and it’s better than ever
Shippiddge,  you make THE best Pokemon animations.
Man, this series has come a long way from dumb shenanigans in Viridian Forest.  Also, that Abomasnow's design could pass for a Gigantamax.
What the hell happened
I waited so long
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FINALLY
Sad
Wasn't squirtel lv 98 where is the double evolution. i thought blastoise would eradicate the the snow andd the mountain
I will wait for Charmander's return in 2023
FINALLLLLLLYY YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS
LETS GO! IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG! My prediction was off by 2 months and 2 days.
Oh wait he died
i wish charmander didnt die he was my favorite starter
It’s time to wait another 2 years for episode 11
See you next year. Tys
Finally after all those year shippidde upload the 10 episode
this is going on trending easily
I was very upset that charmander died he was my favourite Pokémon
IT'S BEEENNN SOOOO LOONG!!
You know this is good if there is 10k views and 7k likes
Finally it’s done but now we need part 11
OH MY GOD!
Aww man charmander actually died I thought red and blue would choose a charmander and squirtle and one day when their both fully evolved they would meet in the elite four battle
Finally
Awesome 👍
When is the next EP going to come?
Hope for the next episode coming soon
how about Charmander faked his death? Cus almost everyone missses Charmander
ITS BEEN 2 FRICKING YEARS WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
Its been so long and finally
So much feels. It was sometimes hard to watch. Fortunately, you didn't give up the touches of humour that make it so good. I love this story.
Let's go
I don't like Charmander dying and Squirtle taking his place as the new protagonist. For the first 9 episodes their dynamic was the main core of the Starter Squad Series, with Charmander being clearly the biggest character of the two; but now both Charmander AND Bulbasaur are eliminated from the cast?
Amazing,. Well then, uhh next episode? 20 years? (This is a joke.)
Omg that very cool I love ure video man keep going
I hope that i'm still alive when episode 11 is released
No , way tha madman actually did it!
poor charmander and squirtle
Finally episode 10. Did you really kill off charmander though? He was my favorite. I thought squirtle would save him
The wait man, i waited so long for this episode and it was amazing 🔥🔥
no wonder he took so long the pokemon look different
I wonder what there gonna do with mewtwo when he told charmander to find him at cerulean cave or did they just scrap that part?
so worth the wait
you have the most patient fanbase ever man, the wait is finally over awesome.
Christ you got Ed Atlin I love that man
Where is Charmander
WHOOOOOOOOOHHHHH wasn’t expecting this upload!
I like the move 😍😍😍 new :)
I think next bulbisuar will return or sumthin and maybe in the last episode charmander returns
Another 2 more years  for the next episode... "yay"
Does squirtle even have character? It feels like squirtle just have character development to become an half assed copy of charmander, his character is already unlikeable compared to even Bulbasaur. It does subvert expectations but in the worst ways possible as people lose interest in the story, it doesn't seem to be the same story it was. The evolution scene doesn't have much impact to the story when it is not the right character, think about it like this, even when it takes a couple of chapters for goku to transform into Super Saiyan, the moment when he transforms is still the moment of impact. I love the story and all but there's no payoff to the previous story. It's just like "Charmander went to fight the worms and squirtle betrayed him and killed him, then squirtle was just being controlled by the worm until it releases him" end of story.
Wait hold on what happened to charmender
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! now i have to wait forever for the next episode it's sooooo Gooood But the wait is sooooo painful!
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!
All of these animations are cool and epic ! This journey was amazing. I cant wait for season 2 ! [ if u make one ]
You live!
Pls make an ep 11
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS OUTTTTTTTTT!!,!!! YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
What the actual fuck. This is awesome LMFAO
The best line in this vid XD "IM A BIRD, TWEET TWEET"
😱
Since when do these take YEARS
FIANLLY
Finally
YAS FIBALLY
Finally
HES FINALLY CAME BACK! THE LEGEND
I really didn't expect charmander to die. This was a great video, but a cliff hanger once again lol.
yay!
Finally its a year
Already done with the episode :c
I LOVE THIS STORY ITS SOO EPIC AND WHOLESOME PLEASE CONTINUE IT AND WELL GIVE YOU A FULL SUPPORT!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😊😊😁😁😆😆😆😆😆😆
Thank you spirt god I wanted to see this 2 years
Yoo it's finally here. I really thought we'd be waiting till 2022.
#rip Charmander the original di**
Killing off Charmander is like killing off Optimus Prime 😔
Its here it's finally here
I am sad charmander dies
Finnally
everytime i see starter squad by shippidge, i feel so surreal, this series started when i was 15 in high school and now im watching this as a 23 years-old adult with a career...
This was hilarious I can't wait for part two
Now we just need Lazor Gator to help Blue Shell Man Guy defeat the old gods.
Glad that Bulba is doing well at least 😊. But he probably died in the fire, but at least he died happy, hopefully.
Yessssssssss!!!!!!! Finaly 10th episode
Noooooo...Charmander was my favorite. Why did he have to die. 😭
This was sad
How became that so dark and deep!?
Ooof. I didn't expect Charmander to be killed off, but you know what? I like the idea of dark and dramatic Pokémon stories. The real franchise has be doing nothing but holding our hands lately and treating us like babies. It's fun to see what the fans come out with, these days.
Well now let’s wait 2023 or more to see the end of the episode.
Are we gonna have to wait 3 years for episode 11 and 12? Lol
ITS FINALLY HERE
I was not a fan of this episode. Actually killing off Charmander was a bad move, splitting up the group was dumb and introducing a turtwig and chimchar making us think they’d replace the two when instead have the turtwig leave and kill off the chimchar was pointless. This episode could of been great but in the end it was just subpar and a let down
DAYUM 28 MINUTES
Not char
Low key I think know what is going to happen.  It is no coincidence that atop mount cornet lies the Pokémon god and rulers of space and TIME.
Finally man it was time. BIDOOF IS GOD.
Finnlly thank you shipedge
Also, when's episode 11 coming? Just to be sure. 2016 popcorn Is expired and I need to buy more
I think mewtwo will bring back charmander
Omg finally :D
2 years of waiting
Snover is my spirit tree-nimal
Wow. I did NOT expect it to go in this direction at all, but I really enjoyed it.
Y sandslash?☹
K time to wait another 5 years for episode 11
This series is really awesome
Can’t wait for 2666 when ship finshs ep11
This makes me so happy
Finally
Oh shit this was actually a god of war prequel what a twist
This was worth the wait.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Let the gods up the mountain revive charmander.....
How is a chim char losing to a few bidoofs? (i already know why cuz bidoof is god)
Finally
.
It's sad to see both fire types pokemon died but man this episode hits the feelings, great job on making this wonderful work
It’s been years! Thought the project was over
Absolutely fantastic. Started as a comedy, ended with a huge character development, highlitghing tragic feelings and a teachment for the spectator. You are the only leader of your own life and you decide whats right or wrong. If you fear death and don't respect your own principles because of it If you betray your own life's ethic moral because of fear, then you are only a coward puppet. Die for your ideals
Wow charmander is actually dead and now worturtle is the main character
rip my homework im watching this
Aww screw this. I hate it, I hate the plot holes you left, the part of the story that was never explained, and the decision to kill the main character. Go to hell.
Definitely one of the best episodes yet. It seems time has not been kind to poor old squirtle...  (if you haven't watched this yet, don't read past this line, Spoilers and such)  It seems the death of charmander weighed more heavily on squirtle than I thought, Turtwig was absolutely right about him. That everstone he valued so highly was the perfect representation of his mental state. Squirtle was stuck in the past, he didn't want to move on, he was desperate to re-capture his youth, to bring back the friends, the team he once knew.   Thankfully, it seems he's finally chosen to move on, discarding the everstone and letting go of the past. Upon evolving to a wartortle, it is VERY apparent how much he was holding himself back. If he's that strong as a Wartortle, then as a blastoise, his strength could match or even possibly surpass that of a GOD. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes next.  On a side note, I'm a little dissapointed that the whole MissingNo/Mewtwo plot line didn't really go anywhere (and was seemingly forgotten). Fortunately, what we got instead was simply amazing. That being said, it would be nice to see that previous plot at least get a reference in this new story. I can understand if you choose not to, and I'll be fine with whatever outcome.
10 episode yay
finally its here i have been waiting for years
LETS GOOOOO EP. 10 OF STARTER SQUAD
This is poggers
Just shy of 8k views,  with allllmost 5k likes and sub 100 dislikes.  Now that's what I call a good ratio. Excellent video my dudes.
The wait was worth it I love watching these. Thanks for all your hard work
This should be good
Finally
make a part 111
Kinda sad charmander died. ;(
The next year part 11 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅🤣
that was one of the best thing i've ever seen
I can’t thank you enough Shippidge
WOOOOOO EP 10 BOYS
Yes the animation looks better i understand why this took a while
great video i love blue shell man guy he is my favorite
I haven't seen it yet but lezz gooo. The long awaited episode is here
FINALLY
I have a feeling that Shippiddge finished Episode 10 a while ago and couldn't think of a name. Thats why it took so long He then decided to go with the title we have now, and it's a damm good title
one warturtel killed g max obama snow?          oh gosh
finally lol
Omg he’s back
The Abomasnow scared me
When the world needed him the most..He returned.
I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING, BUT ITS REAL. EP 10 HAS FINALLY CAME OUT!
time to wait for 2 years again
that he is going to wish for charmander to be live
Damn, I wasn't expecting that. I was really thought that squirtle would save charmander. I mean, charmander was crazy for sure and he needed to be stopped, but I would never wish death on another.
Wow. This sh1t is crazy! It's very mature and the story have really evolved, just like Squirtle!
oh HOLD UP, THIS CAME OUT AN HOUR AGO!?
What happend to charmander
FINALLY
yes ep 10
LETS GOOOIO
I miss the LIZARD
Cool
Nooooo not charmender 😞
=O
Y’all finally got the next episode out!!!!! Thanks for sticking with this series for so long! Y’all made my weekend 😎
Can't wait to see arceus
Finally a new episode!!!
LETS GOO
I want Charmander back!😨😱👎
it was worth the wait :)
Ok that Abomasnow model was just awesome!!!!! Now let’s hope we see the next 2 episodes soon
And now we wait for another 2-3years for episode 11
wow
This is Amazing!!
I never thought the day would come..
As series is progressing the length of episode are getting bigger and so the quality and story.hats off to shippidge
Premiere of season 2 I am pretty sure because new storyline
Getting some strong Kratos VS the gods vibes there at the end! Reminded me of GOW3
god of war ice age
It was so cool! Congrats for all of your work!
Wow that was so unexpected! I love these! See ya again in 10 years when the next episode comes out!
prediction for ep 11 : Since sq- no wartortle is level 99, it might evolve into blastoise  why does it feel like ima be called cringe for the sq- no wartortle bit
FINALLY I HAVE WAITED SO LONG IVE BEEN WATCHING EVER SINCE EPISODE 1
Yes
Episode 11 coming in the next 11 years
I'm convinced Starter Squad is just a story for a new Mystery Dungeon game. Travelling to a snowy place, fighting a boss like an icicle convered abomasnow and making your way to the top to kill Kyurem or something gives me hella gates to infinity vibes
NOW WAY ITS FINALY OUTTT
Who knew a fiery bipedal lizard killing a small caterpillar would lead to the complete destruction of societies, incomprehendable casualties, the near-complete elimination of the Caterpie, and the wet turtle's quest to kill god
This series has really gone from a complete 180 from what it originally was, and I'm gonna be here for all of it. Excited to see where the story goes moving forward.
IT TOOK A YEAR BUT FINALLY ITS HERE
I love how original that was I didnt see any of that coming
Me before ep.10- wow this story is pretty chill! *episode 10- exists* Me now- ???
You better watch out if you keep making good content like this Nintendo’s going to sue you into the ground 😓
There is no way you actually posted it. After how many years you finally posted it. In so hyped
Nani?
After all these years....
OMFG
FINAALLLLYYYY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
holy shit this just got dark...damn and mewtwo still fighting missingno and this shit hits different after finding out charmander died trying to get squirtle back
How often are episodes going to come? I am so excited.
Finally is here you wait for a Bunch OF YEAR .you are a slowpoke the most slowpoke in the world
my life is being finished
charmander died😥
R. I. P.  Charmander he will never be forgotten
Woah, 😁
Finnaly thx god
hmm wait isnt arceus a god so squirtle is going to meet arceus and dialga and palkia WAIT dialga can time traver that means....
Woah. I was REALLY not expecting that outcome! 😅  Beautiful storytelling as always!!
This was so good that I can't think of a funny quip to describe it. Amazing work Shipp'!
What happened to Bulbasaur? What gender is the leader Caterpie? What happened to the whole Caterpie den? Where is Dirtle? Where is that one Butterfree's Golem that plays metal music? Where is Mewtwo? Where is MissingNo? Where is that one trainer with the now-likely dead Hitmonchan? Did he revive that Helix Fossil he had?  You have left way too many questions unanswered
I need episodes 11
Wartortle is putting the War in wartortle.
This proves that Squirtle is the best starter
This proves that Squirtle is the best starter
i still don't belive charmander died (imagine if he is on the top of the mountain, that would be very dramatic)
the triumphant return
This episode is really well done, especially the flashbacks! Worth the wait.
Finally after 2 years
It's so sad that charmander died
Finally
Charmanders Spirit lives on in Squirtle. From the very beginning, Charmander wanted to evolve and he refused to submit to anyone and here squirtle is doing just that.
I miss Charmander, Bulbasaur and the random glitched Hitmonchan! Thank you for the episode! Looking forward to the next
Snowway
Damn charmanders dead  Then they got chimchar and he got folded in the first 15 minutes  But I like how squirtle  has become the main protagonist
I was waiting for this momint
Better plot then all of twilight
IT BEEN 2 YEARS FINALLY
finally 10 real life years later
The greatest comeback of the century
Ep 11 :kill arceus XD
Wartortle's voice is crazy, well, see y'all in 2023.
im sad now that i'll have to wait 2/3 years for the next episode.
1 YEAR!!! (Worth it)
While watching anime as soon as i saw the notification of this i prioritized this over the anime as a WEEB. A WEEB YKNOW?! Thats how good this series is
oh my arceus, that was amazing! totally worth the 2 year wait! thank you, Shippiddge!
That was simply amazing 👏 rip charmander
Wooow that was so awesome. Ballsy move to kill Charmander for real. Can't wait to see what happens next.
Also, I love how Chimchar reminds a lot to Charmander because of how he has many anger issues but is an actual pretty good person ( or in this chase pokemon ), on the inside
See you in 4 years for the episode  11
I'm so sorry for creating an myth that you guys cancelled it, I was 10 years old back then and just assumed it.   man the animation quality has changed so much
snowrunt: So what r ya gonna ask? wartortle: Something! me: LOOOOL
Wait a minute... this ISN'T the new Legends Arceus trailer?
Noo his squeaky voice is gone
EIGHT YEARS LATER - I think this is the series I've followed the longest. Here since ep 1! THANK YOU
Ohhh my ghad new episode
I just feel there should have had bulbasuar in it
Finally after so many years
2 years isn’t that long it’s not like there’s 2 more episodes left
plese
I legit can't believe Charmander actually DIED DIED. I got sad whenever I saw his severed head on Caterpie's head.  But its still an amazing episode. Definitely worth the wait!! :)
Yay
Why did Charmander have to die :C
Me watching the other episodes over and over again
EPIC EPISODE !!!!! WORTH THE 2 YEARS WAIT !!!!! BUT PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT EPISODE FASTER..... BUT NONETHELESS, AWESOME !!!!!
damn this is epic. good job man
Yo bro it’s finally here!
Piplup got chosen by a trainer
i want charmander
Wow, definitely not the direction I expected, but I liked it! And love the subtle “what the fuuu- boom” reference too!
Wonder what will happen to bulb- i mean stic- i mean turtwig
Ok nevermind I quit charmanders dead
Mewtwo needs to bring back charmander to be mewtwos servant but then mewtwo lets him go or something but charmanders out for revenge for squirtle and it ends up in squirtle becoming lvl 100 blastoice and charmander lvl like 60 mega charizard
Blue guy shell boy
I wonder if they are gonna meet with mewtwo again?
I swear to god anything with edatlin is automatically the best fucking content.
8:06 Wait just a second, why did I feel like Squirtle will make a great bond with the new starter- Well Chimchar already died a bit after but I'm talking about Turtwig in the show?
22:58 WHAT THE FU- *BOOOOOOOM!!!!!*
Yo
When u going to start 11
Wow… I’ve waited so long!
Well, i can definitely tell i wasn't expecting the series would continue this way, it's very refreshing and now i'm just curious if lvl 99 wartortle has a chance against the gods of time and space
Damn... This is awesome
Oooooh boy I can't wait for the next episode after I wait idk it felt like 100000 FRIKING YEARS LAST TIME OR SOMETHING
This is the level of quality that can be achieved when things take as long as they need to come out.  On one hand im dying to see whats next but then again i also wish it takes as long as it needs to so it can be another perfect episode.
The videos great, thank you for making it shippiddge, im getting tears in my eyes after watching this, hope everyone will see this and i cant wait for the new episode! Im so excited!
omg it actually got released thank you jesus
Quite a big decision of telling us that Charmander died. Respect for you. For those people who really hope Charmander is still alive (Include me), although there's 95% chance he is just died, but he probably didn't die because Mewtwo said it should be Charmander's respondsibility to clean the mess up. Therefore, Mewtwo is going to appear 200% in the following epsoides. He must remember Charmander because he was waiting him in the cave. Quite curios if Bulbasaur will appear for his actual status in the following epsoides. Oh by the way Shippiddge, just want to remind you that you have already uploaded the epsoide 10, and you should change your about page. Thx for those who are reading this text!
FINALLY IM SO HAPPY RN
i have mixed feelings about this on one hand this lives up to the escalation of epic fights and i love the journey Squirtle has gone through as well as the dea of him being strong enough to fight gods  on the other hand charmander was turning over a new leaf and seemed to be ready to be a better friend and maybe even better person to have his story cut short and squirtle just let it happens is kinda anticlimactic
10 years later and missingno is STILL around i hope it has a more major role next episode
It's been TEN YEARS IN THE SERIES!?!
Wtf whyyyyy whyyyy 😢😢😢 charmander dead whyyyyy so saddddd
i waited and waited and it's finally here
Yes it’s has been months or even years since it last started
FKKKKKKKK ITS SILL ONLY 720p An almost 30 min video from shippidge. This gonna be lit af
Charmander was the one who carried this show but now he's dead
I thought charmander didn't die why did u create like that
......  Yeah, I don't...  I can't laugh anymore.  It stopped being funny at the first flashback, when I knew Charmander actually died.  You didn't just ditch the MissingNo side plot, you completely went in a different direction than we all wanted and expected.  I'm feeling a lot of things, and none of them are good. And I'm pretty sure you're not gonna do a flip like bring Charmander and Bulbasaur back to life or anything.
Wow the first time I cried in months
Rrrrrrrrrrr YES
FINALLY i sub and i did not unsub
Wow at that moment he was about to evolve God damn it
Okay time to wait another couple of years and then the next episode will come out
OMG I thought this was a repostttttt Its actually a new episdoe!!
And why are we in sinnoh
Yes finally I have been waiting for 1 year
Welp, see ya in the next 5 years...
OMG FINALLY
At first I didn't like it just because I did not see Charmander death but once I got to the park where Squirtle evolves into warturtle it got interesting I like the fact that it evolved off of kratos it's pretty dope keep it up can't wait till episode 11 comes out
I’m gonna be wrong but I’m predicting that if there are pokegods there he might revive charmander
I've waited for 4- no 5000 years for this
:( so sad to see Charmander died. Squirtle evolving and going from hiding his backbone, to man on a mission was badass. Can't wait to see what happens with Ch.11.
FINALLY
Welp! Lets wait 5 years for the next one
I predict missing no will reset every thing
YYEEESSS it's finally come out after years of waiting!
WE LOVE YOU We will watch you forever until the end please never stop you will succeed.
Where's bulbasaur and charmander did they die if charmander and bulbasaur are dead I'm quit this channel
When you realise squirtel was the main character 😳
I thought episode 10 would never be uploaded
Holy fucking shit its out
Yay it's here
드디어 나와다!!!!!!
That was awesome
See y'all in four years
Yaaaaaaaa
I wonder where is
First of all, bravo for being bold enough to decide's charmander's end this way (which I hope u rly did instead of the usual cheesy one), and finally squirtle decide to evolve,and moved on from the past, and I really hope that he become a badass blastoise and redeem himself in the future story. I honestly like Turtwig and Squirtle's chemistry here, both are actually playing the straight man on the group.
Finally
STARTER SQUAD HAS RETURNED!!!!
Omg omg
Noooooooooooooo charmander
HE BECAME GOD OF WARTORTLE
But where charmander he died? Or he's alive?
I've literally been following this since the start of high school, I'm now at the final year of my uni degree, It's amazing how far this series has come
THIS WAS AWESOME. And i applaud you for having balls for Killing Charmander! sometimes we need to sacrifice some things to create an even better plot!
Dude rip fire monke and chrazared
Ultra Instinct Wartortle has great comedic timing when he fights and that's what matters to me
I don't know why caterpie says she'll pity his next trainer? But, I was hoping he would kill caterpie at the end ngl.
Oi oi 12:48 MEWTWO maybe THIS'LL uhm hint to something
The long wait was so worth it!!! This is my super all time favorite series ever!!!
Awesome !
This is SO well made...Genius :P
Finally- :O
Can't wait for episode 11. Question is Warturtle going to evolve again also I have a feeling that Charmander is going to come back from the dead
My God this is a fucking masterpiece
Yesssssss
The time has come and it is awesome
YESSS FINALLY
Finaly o have been waiting for soo long!
each of these released episodes become more of a legendary moment each time
Dear god. I have waited so long for this. THE GODS HAVE HEARD US!
Sheesh finally! We've been waiting for this hype!!!
He better get dialga at the top of mt coronet to revert time...i cant digest such a sad ending
HE ISNT DEAD BABYYYYY
The wonderful interpretation of the snovers is amazing. Great episode!
...what happened to Piplup 😢
Charmander will comeback
after 2 years its here
worth the wait
Finally
Rip Charmander July 11 2013 -- September 21 2019
Dude i was predicting that maybe Charmander evolved last second and didn't get stabbed BUT NOPE HE DED
1 hour 1.8k
12:50 Subtle reminder there’s still an epic battle between Mewtwo and Missingno taking place in another dimension
This day is Legendary
Aw I wanted to see piplup too
It has been a year and finally a other episode
AWESOME
The wait is over!
No charmendar died
Lesson in this episode: we are all respossible from our own actions, we always have a choice no matter what
I watched this parody because it was full of comedy. Watching this ep in the beginning saddened me because I felt the shift from happy to sad and thought I’d be disappointed. The only disappointment I got was from myself cuz this ep was deep and amazing! Great job, bud! Please keep up the good work and I know it takes a long time but I gotta ask you to make more the sooner you can cuz I wholeheartedly love them!
Next video
Thank you guys for this been waiting
Omg its finally here
I enjoy this series...
Yay a new yt
YES
its finally out yes but i miss charmander and bulbasaur keep up the good work
Me in 2019 watching the premiere of episode 9 *I think mewtwo will save charmander* Me in 2021 watching the premier of ep 10 *welp I guess I was wrong *
and road to 1mill sub
OH MY FUCKING GOD THEY ARE BACK
Waited for it prolonged
BIRD !
Omg I forgot that this existed.. awesome!
Next is chamilion
THE WAITING WAS WORTH IT YOOOOOO
finally it been a year now it here
Abomasnow was epic AF
OH SHIT THIS GOOOD CHAIRMAN IS DEAD bulbasuar actually did that
Charmander nooooooooooo!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Thx for uploading Ur ep is nice
I wanted charmander to live
Finally, a continuation
i have been waiting for this for years
This may sound crazy but, wartortles going the the gods palkia and Dialga it sounds like [space and time] mewtwo needed charmander specifically and could be seen in this video. What if, mewtwo talks to palkia and Dialga and forces them to revive charmander. I doubt he'd revive charmander but who knows this series is a mystery
if this continues please make a shit ton of god of war references.
The next episode coming 6 years later
Time to rewatch the entire series again
Finally 🤍
Watching this at 4 in the morning cause it’s fucking worth it
EPIC
Yesssssssssssssssssss its hereeeeeeeeeeeeeer thank you
Why would you just make charmender die :(
It was worth the waiting !
OMG I waited so long for ep 10 an now after years It is finally here
It was worth the waiting !
Clap Clap Clap
can you make arceus bring charmander to life again like if you agree
12:50 Bro Mewtwo is actively fighting “MissingNo?” What a Chad.
Amazing!  Felt like a 5 min episode because it flew by so fast!
Let's go finally
the giant abomasnow was definitely what took so long to make
FINALY YOU FINALLY MADE EP 10
ITS FINALLY OUT!!  but it’s after 2 years ;-;
Congrats on Finishing the series :D i remember episode 1 came out when i was a kid and now that im just about to turn 18 its finally over
Charnander
oh my god after 5 or 6 months later final is here oh my god yaay!!!
Your work is of of main stream level.
That speech of his was above adressed to himself because of all the orders he accepts without think of the conséquences he not notice but by his actions he slowly become like à human dresser pokémon and betrayed his friends his people and his world
AYO THIS IS LIT no WONDER THEY TOOK SO LONG
Your work deserves so much love and appreciation. The storytelling is flawless, the animation on point and the character development on fire. Thank you for this masterpiece. <3 I really wish the Pokemon Company would get some inspirations from this.
The animation was insane the wasteland everything!
Wow, the new Mystery Dungeon game looks pretty sick.
HOLY SHIT GREG HOFFMAN
What happened to Bulbasaur
Finally episode 10
Finnaly  Edit: is charmander dead..
this is great; but what happened to the missing no storyline
Hooooolyyyyyyy balllls
I'm very sad because Charmender  is dead
2 fire starters killed in 1 episode dang. Good episode tho
NO WAY
Yyyyoooooo. I almost forgot about this.
Finally the episode is here
Bruh Charmanders head 13:15
OML I started watching this years ago finally episode 10
Whenever this series is finished whether it be in 2 years or 10 I would like everyone to know that episode 10 was uploaded at 5am on a Saturday lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Great episode! I'm amazed how much this story has evolved into. Well done to everyone who worked on it!
YESSIR THE LONG AWAITED MOMENT
finallyyyyyy!! omg thanks
Rest in peace to Bulbasaur's voice actor. Thank you for not recasting.
I got excited when I heard Edatlin! I haven't seen him in so long.
I wonder why it takes so long to make this video
Amazing story squirtle evolved in wartortle and the giant abomasnow really awesome and its sad that charmander dead is
so charmander dies
I was like 7 when I started to watch in the begging... I'm gonna be 13 by the time this finishes.
Dear Arecus *pulls off glasses* this series.... it lives?
I think charmander gonna return cause of missing no and Mewtwo
I loved the plotline of Squirtle having to deal with being a soldier with seemingly no will of his own. His fight with Obomasnow felt like him redeeming his past actions in some small way. Massive congrats to everyone involved on making this
DAMN THIS IS AMAZING  Wasnt expecting that 10 years later and knowing that squirtle actually couldnt save charmander is heart breaking Oh also SUPAH SAYIAN WARTORTLE
As shocking as it was, it made me love it even more. I've loved this series for a long time, been following since episode 4 and I must say you've truly outdone yourself this time. Absolutely incredible writing. I look forward to the next episode, take all the time you need.
This is great i cant wait for the next 2 ones
Wait a second was capterpie wearing charmanders head
My guess is wartortle is going to get answers from whatever god there is up there and ultimately ends in reversing time back to when charmander died so he can act against the orders of his trainer- the whole character growth of his actions are his own
This can’t be real
Noooooooooooo charmander is died
Hi
ITS FINALLY HERE
What is that thing Mewtwo is fighting it is really back the wood pokemon with gloves and hunter and Mewtwo is still fighting it's been 10 years it must be hard for Mewtwo it's all their is it their fault because they destroyed the game right?
YAY
After a year 🤧🤧
THE WAIT IS OVER,2 EPISODE TO GOOOOOO!!!!!
if i ever found the youtuber i will dump a bottle of water on them
After 100 years
I'm guessing this means Piplup got chosen, huh?
Ahh what about Mewtwo and missing no
12:51 Mewtwo
Please start another series after this one and upload at least 2 ep in one year , I love this series
Can't wait for episode 11 this was bussin
Yay
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS
this took months to make
Thats funny, in the credits under “Squad Supporters” at time Stamp 26:23 next to “Archer” on the right side you see a Digimon Sprite of Agumon 😂
YES YES FINALLY
So. Fucking. Epic. YES!!!
Oh god I wasn't expecting such twist in the story after a wait so long I forgotten when was episode 9 released.
I CHOKED WHEN I SAW THIS IN MY RECOMMENDED HOLY SH--
finally
YES
50/10 the wait was long but worth it
Funny of how every single thumbnail had Charmander on it. Now there's not, that was a huge hint to Charmander dead
charmander.. i can't believe he died... he will live in our hearts.
Great animation this is fantastic work can’t wait for the next one
This is the best day of my life also my birthday thank u so much
YYEEEAAAAAAAA
Holy
Wow Squirtle becomes Wartortle
Finally
Why did u kill off charmander
It's cool that squirtle calls chimchar the char part bcs he wanted to relive the memories he had with charmander, kinda sad :(
This was not worth the wait.... I'm unsubscribing
why do i somehow suspect that missingno. glitches charizard back to life? or something similar
….. so was it a 6-9 and I was unaware or is that a pun on the time jump
😏
WHERE IS OTHER KANTO STARTERS !!!
are revives in this? what if wartortle revives charmander
I think I know how the story will conclude, but alas I cannot wait to see how it gets there!
Damn this sure was something i can totally see why it took as long as it did the animation looks way better and its so well made
Thank you for devoting all the time and resources you have to make such an amazing series. Ill be here waiting patiently for your next one to come out when ever it is. Take the time you need. I just wanna see it done right so we can enjoy your vision you have to share with us. Thank you again.
FINALLY
omg im so happy that i lived up to this moment, i'm really a big fan of this piece of art, i really wish i could help speed up the cycle of making these videos but i don't really have any money to participate in patreon  T-T
oh my god. FINALLY!
The wait is finally over
Convieniently lv 98 so he can still evolve into blastoise next lol The story with Mewtwo and Missing N0 is still isnt resolved but it's good to see it's not forgotten. I thought this was charmander's story and how he would eventually see the error in his ways and change for the better. It's a surprise to see it was squirtle's story all along. Cant wait for the next one!
YES I WAITED FOR SO LONG
YEEEEESSS FINNALLYYY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS
Snover are great XD
charmander didnt really die…. right???
Waited too long
Wow this is absolutely amazing well done on making such an amazing series so far!

“My area”
Awesooome
I love it
"Char" "Char"mander Chim"char" I like the jojo aspect to this.
This took awhile, but worth the wait
Where the heck is charmander and bulbasaur
Perhaps wartortle will find Time "God" up there (such as Celebi or others maybe?), n return in time to save Charmander.

Man this was epic, how i miss this series. Really hope to see more in the future.
I don't believe it! IT'S HERE!
No way
Where is charmader
Great ep sucks char is dead. Also is Buba dead to? He said he didn't want to leave, yet in the flashback everything is destroy.
EPISODE 9 WAS 2 YEARS AGO, YET IT STILL FEELS TOO EARLY FOR EPISODE 10
R-I-P Charmander b:(
6 minutes in and Big Bibi just dropping mad knowledge. Love the detail on Squirtle’s eyes just to show how stressed he is. Also the fact that he just keeps calling Chimchar Char.
Did you really try to fully reboot this series   Gamers rise let us riot this fucking channel
This was a phenomenal masterpiece of an episode.  I'm going to make a review below because I am this amazed. First and foremost, there will be spoilers from the episode and this is quite lengthy so read in your own interest but I hope I'm not too much of a bore. Here we go:  I just want to give kudos to the way Squirtle's trauma was handled, and shows the conflict between being autonomous and being an agent (essentially being under the control of another person and how that can affect someone. Remember when Red first picked Squirtle at the start of this series? Squirtle saw that as a privilege and was pretty pleased about it at first but the "being ordered around by a trainer" gist began to take a toll on him as he started to feel apathetic and seemingly ruthless under the control of the Caterpie, as he was almost brainwashed and felt like his responsibilities and actions weren't his own; he's just doing as he's told. And of course, due to binding factors that keep one within this agentic state, it is difficult to escape from such control as seen with Squirtle even going against his own moral principles (he's always seemed to have his heart in the right place). Compare this to when he was traveling with Charmander and Bulbasaur. Although he may had not gotten along well with Charmander and has experienced some misfortunes, he felt more free and sympathetic, especially when being around company that will have his back and he can always sort of rely on. You can see how much this meant to Squirtle as Turtwig points out that he's trying to recreate a long-lost memory of some sorts by having a starter trio traveling together, and not even remembering their names. You can see how much Char and Bulb meant to Squirtle, and how the loss of both of them - coupled with being devoid of any emotion or liberty when being under Caterpie's control - had on him (yeah Bulbasaur is most likely still alive but he didn't want to come).   I may be wrong when I say this but I feel like Charmander's rebellious nature had rubbed off on Squirtle a bit when he was out on the mission to get Chimchar back (who sort of embodies Charmander's egocentric spirit). This cue gave Squirtle the realization that he always had a choice and his actions were his own, and this is what the Abomasnow failed to realize. Even if you were ordered to commit heinous acts against your own will, the blood will still come on your hands too unfortunately. Maybe not as much but you're still contributing a cause whether you like it or not, and that's the dark reality. You'll feel regret for an action that you didn't want to do in the first place as it may defy your moral code. There's that limit where you may realize that you could be held accountable for what you are doing soon, and I think this what made Squirtle snap and unleash his defiance not only against the Abomasnow but to his unwillingness to evolve. He wanted to relive the memory that he had with his two other starter buddies and didn't want to change who he was but he came to accept the fact that changes have to be made at a point and things can't go the way they are forever. This is truly what builds him up to be the strong-willed Wartortle that we now recently know and hopefully love.   Things can't stay the same forever and I like how history kind of repeats itself in some sort of way. You had Chimchar (the Charmander embodiment) die eventually and Turtwig (the more sassier Bulbasaur equivalent) not wanting to tag along anymore. Dreams won't always come true and there has to be a point where you take reality into your own hands and realize "Hey, maybe I have to just move on and accept the facts". I personally feel like this is what the episode taught us the most and is truly the greatest highlight of it.  Of course, props to the whole team for such a spectacular episode. The voice acting, overall designs, effects etc. were all amazing in their own ways. I was blown away by the details and I was kept immersed the whole way through.   I can't wait to see where this story heads towards next.
Oh man he wasn't kidding when he said this episode would be different If Wartortle is that strong already, I'm afraid of what Blastoise will be
I can't  believe that you posted this on my birthday
yessssssssssssss😀
dude!!!! what took you so long??? you haven't been active for ages. You do awsome animation. so its worth it.
FINALLY
When is episode 11 coming out
I love this series.
everyone forget about mewtwo :3
Did charmander die
Jesus it's finally here
Please can you make another episode fast
BRO !!!!!!!!! I WAKE UP FOR THE FIRST TIME AT 5am in forever and I see this!!! 😢 I kept refreshing this channel every week for update. Thank you!!!
10:45 was definitely a jab at Squirtle for what he kept doing
WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL JUST HAPPENED
cant blieve i get to see this awesome anime again
Finaly ep 10 is out
The bird and caterpie war. Battle still rages lol. He we go time travel. Or mewtwo mystery
yeeesssssssssssssss
The animation is crispy Thats why it took so long isnt it
IVE WAITED SO LONG
Rip char and char
It's been 87 yeeeeaaaars!
Theory: Wartortle finds Mew-Two on top of mountain and sends him back in time to stop that Glitch creature. Meanwhile he gets oportunity to save his friend Charmander.
OMG FIANLLY
This ep was epic af. Squirtal becomes doom guy after evolving,his past was good. Caterpie fully becomes an ideal  pokemon trainer than regrets it. How da fuq is this better than the ACTUAL ANIME. Great respect for u shippiddge
This is beyond anything I could've ever expected from this series. Wow. Reminds me of the time skip in Infinity War.
Holy sh** is was amazing
Finally, i been waiting for a video from you for a long time😃😍😃😍😃😍
After all these years Its finally here
Slowbro say yes put there In that vid
The animation is crisp
I hope the next one comes out tomorrow
Wow! Well, I certainly didn't expect THIS.👀 I really like where this is going.😁 Well done!💚❤️💙
WTF CHARMANDER IS DEAD
Mais pk ya pas de sous titres en Français ?😭😭😭
Amazing storytelling! So uhh do we have to wait for another two years?
The wait is over but.....       We gotta wait again😭😭😭
I wonder if the Charmander guy isn't available and that's why he died, and that's why this story took such a big turn, or because this was really the way it was supposed to go, either way I'm very satisfied.
cant wait for next episode
It's sad that charmander died however this episode was Fantastic wasn't actually  suspecting charmander to die because of the Mewtwo scene still believe mewtwo gonna get celibi to reverse time to where charmander didn't die but that is too far of speculation can't wait to see the final episodes of this season
Ive been waiting for this
I really do like that squirtle returned to helping others and forming a team, while still being traumatized, really emphasizing the fact that he was still reliving everything that happened to him and Charmander, that's why he calls chimchar "char" and even after being told that he wants nothing to do with him, he insists to continue following him, all that in a last attempt to "fix" every mistake he had made
YES ! Finally ep 10 waitng for this for years !
cant wait for 3 years for the next one :)
R.I.P chimchar
the waiting was worth it
This si the best animated series on YouTube right now!
This was wild. I love you
You've done it, you magnificent man. This turned out incredible! Congrats to you and everyone that had a hand in making this come to life!
Finally is here
I was like, I wonder what that pokemon sfm animator's up to... an hour ago!?
Great episode! Worth the wait, but I wanna call something doe.        Wartortle's gunna meet Dialga at the top of the mountain and get the opportunity to redo everything.
The story just got an upgrade! I'll be looking forward to how this will end. I agree on the flashbacks to let us know what happened after episode 9.   Like how the fire type is hot headed, the grass type level headed, and squirtle lost in thought throughout the episode
At long last its hear I'm gonna enjoy this .
Heres to my childhood
Yes part 10 is finally here
2 years of waiting worth it
It's been 3000 years waiting for this
İTS HERE
There Is no longer starter squad is now trees squad
I’m petrified seeing charmander’s head on the caterpillar leader
:)
A year of waiting and this was released before Pokémon legends arceus
i don't like the new art and charters
Is that charmender head  is charmender dead
THIS IS JUST AWESOME.
Damn what great effort you put into the show. I love it!
What an Episode... and its the longest so far! It really was a rollercoaster of emotions this time... never though Caterpie and Squirtle would destroy soo much... poor charmander... i have hope that he will comeback... even if its not the case this journey is legendary and will always be in my heart... See you guys in 2 years again... this project takes time and love to create... until then... stay save!
Yay he’s finally back and it’s awesome that squritsale evolved
I wonder what happens between episodes
I thought abomasnow was gonna get anticlimactically burned alive by chimchar as a joke for his extreme weakness to fire. Boy this series has changed a lot.
Finally let's go
OMG WHATTTT
No way! Its Finally here im so excited I'm going to rewatch every episode and then I'll sit down and enjoy this with a nice cup of tea 🫖
Top 10 Anime Plot Twists
Wish there was a plot twist where charmander appeared:((

Omg this was so epic 😱😱😱😱 men you are definitely the goat 🐐 i just didn’t like 2 small details:  1 was too dawn short 😫 2 i wish I could have seen it at a movie theater   Congrats man you are awesome 👏🏻   Ps: who else notice Mewtwo at 12:50? Thanks for the likes 👍🏻
Been waiting for this for forever
Im wating for this for 8 month awesome story
The wait was worth it squirtel finally evolved! This episode was awesome and I loved the flashbacks. I’m ready for another long wait though
Congrats buddy. Been following you for nearly a decade now.
Wait everyone died but squirtle. Now that’s kinda dark ngl
Keep up the good work
YOU'RE NOT DEAD YAYAA
Wait I thought the last episode was 10 months ago not 10 years
Plz make ep11
12:50 I the only one that noticed this??
worth the wait don't listen to joel
I love it
After a whole year its finally out
Congrats on the release! Long anticipated!
So is charmander and Bulbasaur evolve
''stickle" lmao
Finally he release episode 10 but is was so awesome i give this 10/10 that makes me wanna cry
Just started the 5 year countdown on episode 11
This was worth the wait
omg finally
NO FUCKING WAYYYYYYY ITS HERE!!!!
Please make a season 2
Finally! ! !
I saw the thumbnail and it took my brain awhile to process that a new starter squad episode got released
Oh thank god, i was worried it would never come out
IT'S FINALLY HERE WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes finally i'm watching the series now
I was really hoping Charmander still alive
charmander and bublasaur carried this series. way to ruin it. change the name btw this isn't about the starter squad anymore it's just a shitty mess. watched this series in my childhood and honestly, I didn't expect a beloved character to be humiliated like that. I'm speechless last episode I was praising you for one of the best and funniest series about pokemon but now I don't know what to say. this is hot dogshit.
nooo charmander :(
Finally it's been like 10 years
I need charmender back 😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Yes yes yessss
YAY after such a long wait, we finally got a new episode to watch. LOVING IT :P
Great episode. I’ll be waiting until 2024 or so.
Omg finally
Let's go
This animation is the very best like no others ever were.
Thank you!
EYYY THIS EPISODE WAS WORTH TO WAIT   But RIP for Charmander   And congrats for squirtel to evolve to Wartortle   I'm gonna wait for episode 11 next year or 2 years
wait so charmander is dead for good? well thats quite sad :(
Damn I wanted to see the mewtwo plot line play out. Idk I see all the praise but I really didn’t like it. Still so much stuff happened in the flashbacks really seems you’re revisiting it.
Finally its here!
where is bulbasaur? if charmander dies then what hapened tobulbasaur
after watching the whole thing and seeing mewtwo at one point. Now I am thinking, did missingno took charmander??? And Mewtwo is still trying to get him back all these time??? And maybe even missingno or mewtwo created the dead charmander head. Idk I'm going crazy of how this series is that good.
the legend continues
HOLY. CRAP! That honestly was a twist I was NOT expecting. I was both disappointed and intrigued at the same time.  So....since there is one last episode, I am extremely curious to know what happens next. Will we ever get to see Andrew, Haunter or Gastly again? I get the feeling we are going to see the monstrosity of MissingNo again.  This was a RIDE!! can't wait for the end!
OMG FINNALY :DDD
Wartortle is gonna ask the “Pokemon God” (Arceus???) to bring Charmander back or return him to that time to make a different decision, what y’all think???
I miss charmander he was the reason I was watching
Is this a huge god of war reference? 🤔 if so, is this gonna be like GoW 2 turn back time?
It’s only been 7 years that’s some quality upload times
While you could've milked Starter Squad out for way longer, it was the correct decision to begin closing it out. Please do grace us a resounding resolution for the coming episodes, so that Starter Squad may least come a full circle.  Now where's the ballad for "Legend of Blue Shell Man Guy"?
I love Snover voice lol crack me up XD and Nooooo charmander he was the heart and soul of the group 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ye
Why channabder is ded
Why the charmander dies? Why?
Why the charmander dies? Why?
ITS FINNALY HERE WOOOOOOOOO
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You cant kill charmander like that i liked charmamder. Plz revive charmander next  episode
Am disappointed squirtul didn't yell  "So long gay beaver"
Hey hey hey
Did charmender died 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bring back Charmander and kill that cat are P
Finally it's about time
This Is chimchar dare to kill bidoofs?
holy fu* this is amazing!
Was it worth the wait?              YES
I think this is my favoritt part
I have waited 4-no, 5000 years for this!
The dark tone was a nice surprise.
Yes finally this is out ive been waiting for this
Omg the best thing ever
Finally
Its impressive how a funny cartoon about starter pokemon turned into this  Amazing work my guy!
Can you make episode 11 went Charmander be alive
That’s late
Soo noone gonna talk abt Mewtwo and the glitch thing that appeared? 12:50
God I waited so long
This episode was awesome
I remember when watch this as a kid when starter squad just a simple story and it grew so much ,i still remember waiting for the next episode to come out .it started when charmender ,spuirtle and bulbasaur just go adventure ,train and maybe beat up other pokémon and now wartlotle gonna fight the god fo pokemon i pretty sure if i show this to myself as a kid or me after watch ep 9 it would suprise me. I just what to say Thank you ❤ Shippiddge for making Starter squad and keep up the good work👍.
I cant wait for 11 ep
I'm just watching your 2years ep of this
Now to wait for a few years for the rest of the episode
This was dark, awesome, heartbreaking.... This was just beautiful, TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!!   Well, see you again in Episode 11 in 6 years guys....
I grow up watching and waiting the series
It is over :(

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNALYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Snover is funny
i dont want this to end....
LETS GO
I'm sooo tired of waiting
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Chammander?

Finally after 1 year🔥
Finally after years a new video
AYO IS THIS THE PLOT WERE CHARMANDER COMES BACK OR SMTH?
After 2 years. We finally got it.
Finally
Now I'll just have to wait for another year  worth it
Let's hope the pokemon "gods" can do more than just bring back chimchar
12:50 lol its mewtwo
When will you make part 11 I’m really looking forward to it!!!
Dude this is so amazing I'm so invested in this story
I never thought this day would come :,) Thanks for all the hard work!
Imagine if he just evolved into a Blastoise, how powerful would he be?
Boy can't wait to see the next...10 YEARS LATER!!! Sh!t got real really fast XD
See Ya'all in 5 years when it gets randomly recommend to new people
So charmanders dead...? *starts crying*
Charmander dead and Bulb
Deep
I didn't expected charmander to die just yet and bulbasaur became caterpie's cow and he accepted that life Sucker didn't even tried to help charmander  Charmander was always on his own.
I am not going in to the comments
Finally this "EPISODE" trailer Sneak Peak is over  Edit:) i thought you died but the trailer made us unworried  Edit 2:) Make Season 2 1st episode hint Charmander comes back  Edit 3:) put charmanders bro   edit 4: i think that a legendary god pokemon is up the mountain and wartortle will ask to revive chimchar and charmander... idk
Staying up until 5:00 AM was worth it to watch this amazing video
Finally its here and its awesome!
I have no idea what’s happening anymore. It’s great!
Finally
I have never clicked on a video faster in my life
BEST. EPISODE. EVERRRRR
This has to be the greatest thing to wake up to.
ok this is good but when ep 11
Will you make anything else after starter squad because your animations are great
Fearow is hilarious but Golbat was funnier🤣🤣🤣
It's been 84 years
Wow
Epic
COMMENT FOR THE ALGORITHM!!!!
Let goo
My guess is the Mewtwo at 12:51 will be important in a future episode
Yaaay!
This series is the literal definition of chpt. 1 make friends chpt. 2 kill god
It’s been a year where have you been?
Rip charmander :c
why kill charmander
The prohecy
LETS GOOOO
YO IT'S OUT!
i wonder what a giantanmax mega blastoys looks like.
Dang this is cool still sad that the charman is dead.
Do a ep 11 episode 11 please l want to see it make it epic battle to meet go
where is charmander and bulbasaur
His shell isn’t even blue
OMG! This was epic and hilarious! Plus, I can see Squirtle being Eijiro Kirishima with the memory of Charmender being Bakugo who died for his friend! This is dark, but awesome at the same time!  Great work you guys! I love it! XD
Finnaly i get to wacth eps 10
For me, waiting for the series was worth. I love the new characters and new badass bluey.
YO YO YOYO HOLY SHIT LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
pls
OH MY GOD ITS HERE
I think that the hat that caterpie had is his skin of him evolving and he is alive looking for revenge
again
FINALLY
Year later episode 11
Saw this on my timeline and honestly could not believe my eyes. FINALLY HERE
They are as beautiful as the day we met them....
This was awesome did not see the ten year time skip coming
Gonna come next year again
Who else has been waiting so long for this
WhT a coincidence
rip Charmander
Charmander you were the light of the shadow, you were the water of hell, the soul of the series, but now it's all over, the little charmander died at the hands of a stupid psychopathic worm with the help of the treacherous squirtle, the good that he will revive thanks to Arceus and is he going to kill the damn caterpillar, or is it all going to stay that way? : / We will find out in the next episode which I hope will be in 3 or 4 years.  PD: The animation is excellent.
I totally fuckin forgot it was close to releasing, so this was a nice surprise to see.
Oh wow I didn't realize charmander died. Sad. But what happened to bulba? Oh and what happened to the mewtwo storyline? It can't just lead nowhere? Will charmander come back somehow? Maybe with the help of dialga, since abomasnow was talking about gods of time and space, and then they could go fight mewtwo together. Or charmander returns as a ghastly? Hmmm??
Welp... looks like I have to stay alive for yet another year. BRAVA. BRAVA!!!
YES FINNALY
How many years we have been waiting....
Better animation and story than Sword and Shield... Okay, jokes aside, this is phenomenal stuff, this series has definitely taken a drastic turn and I loved every second of it. The animation (especially the water) is breathtaking along with the fight scenes. The only thing is that Wartortle's voice is a bit jarring, like that's the voice I would expect from a Blastoise, but that such a minor nit pick.This is easily gonna be top 5 best pokemon related content of the year. Welp, see you all in 3-4 years for episode 11
This has become an anime
Turtwig is my spirit animal on this episode lol  New starter squad series? Kanto was first, do Johto next or hoenn or skip to sinnoh since turtwig & Chimchar was here
The return of the king
Well can’t wait to see ep 11 for 2 years
I will miss squirtles voice going forward, but this was fire. Well worth the wait.
get your "here before 1Billion views" ticket
And now... A legend has born
Can you also make a starter squad season 2 in the johto region
Nooo charmander can t die 😭
Charmander is dead. Nooooooo I Likes His roughless character.
I stared when im a kid now im a giga chad

Hey what happened to charmander and  bulbasaur  did they evolve pls bring them back
Ghastly the Charmander
Everyone is screwed Squirtle evolved
finaly after 1 year :O
finally a new starter ep
In all episodes before I thought charmander was the protagonist, and totally shocked that he actually died, but guess it was squirtel this whole time. lol
HYPEE
When will the stupid Caterpie die
No waaaaaay I knew it was coming back!!
No!!!! How can Charmander died?!!!!
Took long enough
My mind has been 🤯🤯 I enjoyed every second of this this was really great please keep up this great work I’m enjoying every second of it
finally
What happen to bulbasaur
i love the snover in this epsiode!
I hate this series without charmander the series is worst
posting here on launch day launch hour. inbefore million views!
I just hope that in the last episode that squirtle will be on the verge of death and popedepaaaaaaaaa charmander is here
I love it beautiful
when 11 i need this
Allright, see you guys in 3 years
FINNALY
finaly
Finally
wow charmander actually died
Oh boy, ep 1-9 were just 3 friends adventuring, this turned real dark real quick
23:00 animating all that snow probably took a fucking year all by itself
Me: I can't wait to see charmander again, I hope he's ok. Me minutes later: my baby char noo...
Awesome
It's so dark
YES IT'S HERE
i'll be honest, i kinda forgot that ending to ep9...
nobody sad about charmander dying?😟😟🙁😿😿😿
Yes
It finally happened ...  It's been so much a year ...  I can not believe this...  What I saw in this episode ...  I saw the pros and cons ...  Shippiddge ... you are great ... the atmosphere ... the coloring ... you did it all ... and I'm just in tears from the fact that you didn’t quit filming Starter Squad. There were so many memories of old heroes such as:   Charmander ...  Bulbasaur ...  Squirtle ...  Mewtwo ...  Nidorino ...  The appearance of new connching characters delighted me, but at the same time sadness because I was not used to saying goodbye to other old characters ... I cried when I learned that this worm had killed my beloved character Charmander. He was my favorite just like Bulbasaur ...  And now these characters have left this series ... But I hope that these characters at least got to heaven ... And I hope that Squirtle will meet them in heaven when he prolongs his remaining life ...  Thank you for such a show ...  I hope the next episode comes out as soon as possible ...  😭😭😭
My fav character chatmander just oofed sad :(
Omg it's finally here you are so talented thx for this amazing series
Ahhh! It's out!!
"lvl 98" Soooo is it for lvl 99 to Wartortle then 100 for Blastoise
Please charmander return
Squirtle really activated ultra instinct
not worth the 2 year wait upload more often
I... honestly can say that I had not expected any of this when episode 9 premiered all that while ago, or hell, when I first started watching this series and... I’m happy to be sitting here, shell shocked by how this has become such a powerful story.
YESSSSSSS
Yes finally ep 10
Also this episode is awsome
Thank you so much! I finished binge watching these series for the 3rd time recently, so happy it keeps going strong and better each time!
Finnaly
The return of the king
I love this series and we still have 2 more episodes
poor charmander
Charmander died..... that hit hard
Didn't expect that Wartortle have a very different voice than squirtle
Its finally here!
now I'm more interested about what blue shell man guy going to ask the pokemon gods
The fact that this series is 8 years old and still going is amazing to me
This episode was bad it feels like a new series no charmander no bulbasaur horrible episode
i sure do love my yearly episode of starter squad
Well, now another 2 years for the next episode😁🤣
Wow the waiting time was totaly worth it this was soo good. I hope to see turtwig and bulbasaur again.oh by the way when is episode 11 coming?
This episode felt surreal and not in a bad way, not in a long shot  (click "read more for spoilers)       It’s not often you see a story where the main character ends up getting killed off  Bravo, shippiddge, bravo. You’re producing some good shit
Charmander died and literally everyone died, I really do hope we see Bulbasaur again because they have been my favourite and time to wait another 2 years for ep 11
This is the best one
Wtf
Goodbye char and bulba
I approve this is a banger
yay now i know that he did not die
Banger of an episode 🔥
I'm here! Hello! :D Time for more awesome and stupid crap.
nice
I’m so excited to see chimchar 😢 😭
Episode 10 of Starter Squad is finally here and it looks so good! 😍
Great to see this still going strong :D Keep up the great work👌
It has finally happened
So I'm assuming the world hasn't ended as Mewtwo sacrificed itself, taking Missingno with it in that blink and miss it battle? Also, who else thinks the God that Wartortle will meet will be Dialga, and he'll go back to the Caterpie vs Charmander moment and save Charmander?
EPISODE 11 NOW!
So let me get this straight, Charmander is dead, Bulbasaur is who knows where, Squirtle moved to Sinnoh and is suffering survivor's guilt from the looks of things, his Charmander replacement died, his Bulbasaur replacement left, and now he's turned into the Wartortle version of Kratos... I absolutely love it. Now I hope we see him go Blastoise on them gods.
Youtube: "You're alive?"  Starter Squad: "My death was, greatly exaggerated."
*Squirtle* - The naive nerd *Charmander* -Has a piece of Bakugou in him (but not quite) And last *buh* not the least *Bulbasaur* : The cute walking vegetable who agrees with everything
Can't believe Charmander is dead 😭 hope Wartortle will ask Dialga to go back in time right before Charmander broke Hitmonchan PokeBall so Mewtwo Will not have to fight against missin
I have been longing for this more than the third season of mindhunter. Thank you kindly my good man.
Nice i just woke up
Finally Best pokemon anime
At last ❤️
This. Was. Better. Than. Anything.
what theres a 10 eps?
The trees.. The voice reminds me of collage textbooks vs the internet
IT'S FINALLY FUCKING HERE OMG

legends arceus reference😳
rip charmander
Finally it was a great vid
Holy fucking shit guys, it's here

Yessssssssssssssssssssassssasssssss

Another title ideas:Blue betrayer evolves n kill abomasnow for a few minute
I can’t believe Charmander actually died
I wonder what happened to Bulbasaur... Maybe he's a pokemon god...?
HOLY SHIT, IT FINALLY CAME OUT!
I did not expect this to release today
ANARCHYYYY technoblade is here as monke
I cant wait for the next epi this series is awesome
IT WAS SUPER EFFECTIVE
WÒOOOOOO
right time to watch episode 1 to and 9 and come back for the 9th time
Charmander was the best.. Our boy faded awey... But he will always will be in our hearts
Now i cant want for episode 11
9:28
Since the episodes come so far apart we can truly witness the evolution of storytelling which often mirrored trends in fanmade parodies all presented in a uniform artstyle, its quite bizarre once you go back to that episode one after watching this.
Sheeeeeeesh!
Im not really interested like i always do i guess it because charmender is dead
why did you killed charmander plzz try to bring him back
after 1 year of waiting the 10th episode is made i love these
I've been waiting for this. And the video got over my expectations easily. Satisfaction
finally episode 10 came
Finally. A new episode
Well... I don't think any of us saw this coming. The whole story took a complete 180.
FINALLY
That was fucking awesome
YOO finally
waiting here until bulbasaur shows up in any flashback
It's here
FINALLY
the wait its over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't believe Charmander's dead! 😭
It's been 10 years since your last video
Holy crap
Why can't everyone be like Big Bibby?
Sorry I mean charmender
Oh. My. God.
Wtf is this real
It's absolutely crazy to think that I started watching starter squad when I was 11-12 Now I'm close to reaching my 20s This is an amazing series to grow up with, thank you Ship 🧡 I hope to see more soon
HE UPLOADED OMG HE UPLOADED!!
This episode is amazing! Love it!
I love the snovers 🥰
LETS GOOOOOOO
The ending was so perfect after squirtle evolved
yesssssssssssss its            backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
😞😞 No charmandet
My heart stopped when I saw the notification to this!
thought you gave up on us
This episode has exceeded expectations. Well done! I didn't expect this to get so dark. It honestly feels like something out of _Game of Thrones_ .
It's sad that charmander died
Why why has charmender died
This episode hits in the feels man. Show completely abandoned being a comedy and shifted to drama
Ep. 10 is there and it's amazingly made good job
Now i need to wait for 1 year.....
FINALLY FUCKING FINALLY
The biggest testosterone rise ever.
Oh, I was wondering what the hell this channel is. I watched this around 6 years ago or something, I really don't know why I'm still subscribed to this.
When it will come episode 11
Finally! Damn the wait
Trash episode. Gave up. Trash
Snover is the best pokemon in this series lmao
That was great will wait for next episode even if it takes a decade..
This is just Pokemon x God of War now
What the hell When my boy Charmander dead😭😭🤬🤬🤬🤬😭😭😭
6,139th!
I was eating and when i saw this, i spat all my cereal
Just watched the whole episode and WOW. That was like nothing I expected to happen. Anyway good job shipp! See ya again in like 3 years
DAM IM EARLY
LETS GO EP 10
Finally I thought you gave up
Yoooooooo it’s out
So he couldn't defeat a potato with a skirt now he defeats giant mega Obama
I love your videos I started with episode one but when I saw there was a 1 hour video with all the episodes I watched all af them in one day I even rewatched them because it was so funny
chimchar reminds me of someone
Finnaly!
WAIT CHARMANDER ACTULLY DIED!!!!
I waited so long
fans literally 2 seconds after episode 10 gets released: where's episode 11
It's been so long...
YESSS, wow cant belive i witnessed this so soon after it coming out, glad i did though
If he was that strong as a wartortle then think how strong he be when he evolves again
time to wait 2 more episodes ;-;
Why do i feel grim satisfaction at the karma of caterpillar dude that killed charmander
Why did this all happen? Its only because red picked up squirtle if he didn't picked him this all didn't happen
Theory: Chimchar is Charmander in a new body, Turtwig is Bulbasaur's friend.
"After nine years of development, hopefully it was worth the wait."
Not me who binged watch all the other episodes again to lead up to this moment 😌
Please make charmender alive
FINAAAAAAAALLLLLYYYYYYY
ETS FUCKING GOOO
Goddamn ive missed this, its worth the wait! 💯
I've been waiting for two years for this and it was worth of waiting. Nice!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Guess the starter squad went solo
1 yr wait for a 30 minute video, definetly worth it :D thx shippidge
This was so worth 2 years
I knew charmander died! But nobody believed me!
Charmander he dead
I’m so sad charmader died
To be fair, I know this is not the point, but Caterpies cause was way more justified than the story gives it credit for. Lizards and birds alike are killing his brethren, I would fight that too! I mean yeah you lose everything, but you would probably lose everything either way!
that blue guy sure would look cool wih some shades
LETS GOOOOO
Now that was worth the wait..
Finally...
charmander was dead!?😇😂🥲🥲🥲
Felt God Of War vibes... i like how there is no plot armor and charmander just died... charmander went through everything for squirtle... now squirtle bout to do the same... wonder if bulbasaur and turtwig will meet...
Hm, I still hope that charmander isn't dead (even though he probably is). I hope that him and bulbasaur make a return somehow
This is.. really hearbreaking The flashbacks actually made me cry A silly show with funny Pokemons became a depressing story and a true masterpiece.  This chapter took you really long to make, but now I understand why. It was worth waiting.  Thank you.
Time to wait 3 more years lol
God this series is awesome it is probably  going to take three years though the next episode but it is going to be worth the wait
Amigo como vas a matar al alma de la serie Charmander? y lo peor, caterpie lo mata, aun se puede arreglar la serie pero ya no sera lo mismo sin el, ojala Arceus reviva a Charmander y se vengue del psicopata de caterpie.
Yayy!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌 That was awesome ! But charmender .... 💔💔😭😭😭
Ok , for a moment i though i miss a ep , kinda jumping the shark there
The Legend Strikes Back!
Bring back to life Charmander with revive crystal.
I'm so sad that char, and charmander dies..RIP: Charmander, RIP: ChimChar     Also why is it so dark???
MORE PLSSSSS ITS TOO GOOD TO STOP WATCHING
Thank god our it’s back
Charmander is not here sad
Let there be carnage.
Ed Atlin?! Dude thank you so much. It has been so long since weve heard him voice act.
This is not the real starter squad I am unsubscribing
FINALLY OUT AFTER A YEAR
at long last
I Kinda feel sad how charmander isn't in the show anymore and squirtle evolved and have a new personanillity. Time to wait another 2 years really thought either mewtwo or that cursed pokemon  would be here but sadly not. Its fine though still a great show. This is so good that it deserves to be in the real anime I'm not joking
Rip charmander
When you just give up on the previous plot entirely.
🤩
holy shit its finally here
great a new episode see u in 3 years
Mega blastoise vs arceus
iv waited a year for this omg :)
Finally! YESSSSSS! YESSSS! YESSS! YES!
After millions of years FINNALYY
Finally!
I liked the part where Big Bibby appeared
Di....... did the Beaver Society just all die other than Big Bibby
Fear the level 98 Wartortle slayer of the emissary of giritina
nice vid as always, see you all in a few years in the next video!
:0 only late 33 minutes babyyyy
When will ep 11 release after 3 years?
Amazing job the animation and voice work is inspiring
Im so happy ahhh for 2 and ahalf years finaly
Wait so...Charmander really...dies....wow. I loved the video but I'm kinda sad and disappointed about that.
That was dope, alright see you in 2 years
NOOOO CHARMENDER DIED
So does this mean charmander is dead?
GOOD JOB THIS EP WAS SOO WELL MADE MY JAW DROPED KEAP UP THE GOOD WOURK
I liked it but I think the story has lost its way a bit... I just felt there was no sake in like 80% of this video... would have much preferred to know exactly what happened the second after charmander was slain
This was well worth the wait
This series is AMAZING love everything about it!
awesome. one thing I hate its that you killed charmender. he is my favorite starter and one of my favorite pokemon. one question: when squirtle evolve into wartortle, why did he get a white aura and eyes? did he entered god mode or something?
Just finished it AND ITS SO AWESOME AHHHHH f in the char for charmander :(
Finally
good job i have been waiting for 2 years sadly charmander died :(
I love this, keep up the good work!
is this... real??
“I can’t remember the last time i had a flashback”😂😂😂
Holy shit, usually stories deteriorate in quality over time, somehow this keeps on being epic.  See you next year
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS???  Finally it's here❤️
Pokémon Z: Battle of Gods.  Wait what?
HOLY FINNALY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Noice! Finally the wait is over!!!! Yooooooooo  Wait charmander really died!?!

Lord bung now has a less excuse.
Hope Arceus bring is old life back. And don't forget Mewtwo. Very good Part😍 And so Long. You make a great job
When I saw this notification I literally started hyperventilating the wait does that to you.
That was awesome!!! I can’t wait for the next episode!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I don't think anyone expected anything that happened here. Good episode, now see y'all in 2023 when episode 11 releases and he uses dialga to go back in time and save charmander. ✌
Half an hour of a masterpiece was worth the wait, Thanks Shippage
I just watched the other episodes. I love these
This episode was brilliant and heartbreaking, this whole series is amazing!
nccccccccccccccc
Slowpoke is evolving...
Ah the Expresso depresso episode
well, this one was definitely different, can't wait to see whether the gods of the starter squad world are arceus/the god trio or if it's gamefreak also r.i.p mewtwo, i guess that Missingno plotpoint is never being followed up on EDIT: yes i did see mewtwo fighting missingno at 12:50
Charmander died?! GO TO HELL CATARPIE 😭
Snover is like my favorite right now.
👍🏻
I can't believe you guys spoiled us with a 28 FREAKEN MINUTE LONG EPISODE . You guys are far too generous
Holy shitballs!! I can't believe it's finally here
When will charmandar  return
We want Charmander 😭😭
THIS HOW HE DIED WHY DID HE DIDN'T EVOLVED SUCH A WEAST OF TIME
This episode was amazing and Squirtle proved to be a better protagonist than Charmander 😊😍😍
Sooo many things have changed.  That battle should've lasted more.
I can't wait for 11 episode
This is awesome can't wait for the next one!!!!😄
This was an amazing episode, sad that Charmander died and Chimchar for being a dick and disobeying died too, i wonder how Bulbasaur is doing tho
When will chaendar return
This sh*t is fire
Charmander a death gave me sadness and some trash caterpie wearing charmanders head gave me extreme anger
NO CHARMANDER CANT BE DEAD
Charmander is alave as a gastly

Sad😢😢😢😢squirtle
The final episode should have all the starter Pokemon

I thought that Charmander is main character and he would survive  Sad :(
just finished the episode, he's gonna ask the gods to revive charmander
OMG i've been waiting for this forever
Bravo. Just. Bravo. I'm floored with everything that was revealed in this episode. I couldn't even wrap my head around half of what happened. But I do have a feeling I know what's gonna happen next. And I'm excited to see what's gonna happen.
That god damn caterpie
Tis a forgotten memory until this upload popped up in my reccomended. I must binge the series all over again.  I must also add, I totally recognize DawnSomewhere, that brings back MORE forgotten and cursed memories.
SHIT THAT WAS AWESOME! Gonna miss the og leader and bulby tho
Yes the moment I been waiting for
OMG THIS WAS ACTUAL FIREEE
BIDOOF 1: -"I'm not enjoying being kicked anymore"  BIDOOF 2: -"I am, but I recognize that's an unhealthy lifestyle"  My sides....

YOO
Nice!! Now I am curious about bulbasaur
I didnt expect charmander to actually die
And now we wait another year…
"What the fu-" Omg I can't XD

Congrats on releasing!
What about missingno though, that still a thing
You mean I waited 2 years just for an episode to end on a cliff hanger I mean what is this. I want more content faster what are you doing I don’t understand how did you take 2 years for a 28 minute video. I am sorry to say but I am disappointed. The episode may be good but really 2 years and a cliff hanger.
Omg!!! Yes! Absolutely godlike
I’ve been watching this series for year congratulations on the upload
Its been 3000 years
Spoiler warning ⚠️   Biggest twist ever QwQ I thought charmander would ever die since he was a main character but guess I was wrong But dang look at bad ass Squirtle over here.^^
The animation quality though, that was well worth the wait! Nice work!
MY MAN WORTURTLE IS MOR OP THE BLOODY MEWTWO
FINALLY
Worth every second. Thank you, with all my heart <3
Wartortle vs the Pokemon Gods. My bets are on the angry Wartortle who dragged a random Chimchar into his own death because some bug killed his Charmander friend.

My Idea For Starter Squad Episode 11 My Plot Idea: Squirtle Now Evolved Into Wartortle Is Going On An Journey To The Mountian To Find Someone That Makes The Rules While Reunited With An OLD GREEN FRIEND Along. (Also I Think That The Episode Will Release Sometime In 2022)
Holy shit I didn't expect to see it today
Shippiddge I really appreciate your work on this episode, keep it up!
Finally new vid
Holy crap. I guess, in the end, Caterpie become the monster he strove to fight against. And Squirtle really needs to see a therapist. Shippidge never fails to deliver on quality episodes. I can’t wait to see where the next one goes.
Now this should be good
LESS GOOO
RIP To Charmander Frick All The Caterpies
FINALY

What Happen to Bulbasaur

"A true friend doesn't care if he's actually your friend."  True words of wisdom, tree stump.
I been waiting for 1 year ahhhhhhhh
JESUS
2 more episodes
WTF chamender can't die like that
in my opinion this is the best pokemon series
17:55 "You can tell because there are X's where its eyes should be" Never laughed that hard for years. 🤣 Thank you so much for finally uploading EP10. This sentence alone was worth the waiting. ❤️
YOOOO IT'S HERE
WE NEED MORE
Hi
Only og's can like this comment
So we know what happened to squrtle, charmander and a sentence for bulbasaur but I miss bulbasaur he was my favourite
YESSSSSSSSSS
I have never clicked faster on any video. This series is so amazing. I just loved how Wartortle went super saiyan like that. I was expecting him to evolve all the way to blastoise since he's a level 98 but this was fine too. Keep up the good work mate. Also, please finish this before I die :P
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
POV: you have watched this episode multiple times
Sorry but I just don’t like the way this series went. Such an underwhelming end for bulbasaur and charmander. Just my opinion
So the Snow monster is basically the SCP 001 Gate Guardian?
Best
Salameche est mort :( terrible désillusion xD
WHEN I GOT THE NOTIFICATION I DIDNT EXPECT THIS
ok but is charmander ok
Holly sh*t look at the animation
Why didn’t they make a pun about that there is “Snow Way” go get past.
Squirtle has finally taken his place as leader.  And all it too was for Carmander to die. 🥺
Bruh...this episode is so deep :'( But the good thing is that Squirtle EVOLVED
WAAAAWOOO SO FUNY!!!
RIP CHARMANDER
That was awesome!!!
Not the direction I expected this series to take, but certainly a welcome one.
Why did charmeder died
After 1 year u done it u did it

FINALLY
Only one minutes in,  Is this Charmander reincarnated? Three minutes in, Wow, Squirtle looks sleep deprived. 6:27, Oh okay sorry, I thought you were a ant. 7:20, I'm probably wrong but the first thing that came into my head was, "That's dictatorship" 7:57, Ooooh Shi- 8:03, Wait, what about Bulbasaur? 8:20, Oh okay. 9:00, Wow that reminds me of Pidgeotto 9:59, This gives me "Ooh look at me, I'm a big scary Ghost" vibes. 10:32, Squirtles like 10/11 years old right? What about Mewtwo and Cerulean Cave? 10:53, Actually Charmander did that alot. 10:55, There it is. 11:07, Uhhh I don't know, Plantosaurus? 11:54, Hehehe, ChimCham. 12:17, Charmander didn't even make the hats. 12:20, Ooh Whiskers. 12:31, *Gasp* Revolution. 12:50, Omg, Mewtwo and the Missing No wannabe with the ugly face. 12:56, I looove revolutions. 12:57, I remember this Caterpies name. 13:04, This reminds me of the cult from Midsommer, also some murder of the same kind? Or whatever that's called. 13:16, Oh Shi- 13:18 See even Whiskers is confused/concerned. 13:32, HhUUh. wow they really did it, it does seem like a dictatorship. 13:43, I thought that Whiskers would go berserk for a second. 13:36, Now now? No, okay then. 14:17, Uuummmm 14:20, Realising i could've watched the entire episode by now. 14:31, But I do not get cold. 14:39, Wait there's more. 14:47, Oh you're so gonna regret that. I accidentally put Q instead of one, and now I'm thinking of Cutie from It Takes Two. 15:02, Cause there's snow in the way? 15:08 Huh, oh okay. 15:10, They're talking about life. 15:15, *Blinks twice in confusion* 15:20, "Hey Snow!" 15:29, Like grapes. Man I'm gettkng tired now 15:31, no. Also instead of one I put a lower case q and now I'm thinking about Professor McGonagall and now the role her actor plays in Sister Act. And now grapes again, just perfect. Now octopie. 15:38, Oooh England, and the rest. 15:38, Bye-bye. 16:31, Two things. One, I forgot about this plot point. Two, did a comment I wrote on this not save!?!? 16:43, With a tree!!!! Oooh a tree with a tree, classi. 17:39, Their voice reminds me of Mewtwos. Also no diffrent from who? 1741 Sounds like a War date. Probably is one. 17:47, Earth, right? Cause I do not want to piss off Mother Gaia anymore. 17:54, Oh my god is he dead!?!? 18:19, Maybe cause you look sleep deprived? 18:47, No I don't. 19:05, He's probably gonna return, oh hey look, on of the may Bloody Sundays. 19:19, Whhhhat? 19:37,  I wonder what Char Chars last words would've been. 19:27, Who, the worms? 19:35, Huh, Regice? 19:48, The Snow Sandslash? 19:52, I'm slrry, I'm sorry, Dirtle. 20:01, Hypothermia dude. 20:09, *Gasp* Whiskers died?!? Is Squirtle still known as Bluey to them? 20:10, Those eyes. 20:17, That face though. 20:22, Die maybe? 20:29, Yeah cause of Pablo. 20:31, Maaan I miss Bulbasaur. 20:35, Oh theh do call Squirtle Bluey. 20:40, Ehhh, that probably won't change anything. 21:00, Oookay, now I'm nervous. 21:13, Stkll that face though. 21:25, Oh cool, he's free. 21:36, Oh my god, wait what?!? 22:01, Ooooh. 22:10,  oh. Well that was anticlimactic. 22:24, Nevermind. 22:37, What about Mewtwo? 22:38, Now I want to watch the little girls death from the pokemon movie. Wasn't her name Amber or something? I remember the good old days of Charmander burn down Pokemon Centers, oh where has the time gone? 23:01, Okay, I laughed at that. That 🤏 was good. 23:21, Is Wartortle going through an emo phase right now? 23:27, Ah nevermind. 22:55, The Fu- 24:03, Oh nevermind, Char Chars algood, for the most part. 24:09, Haven't we all? Eh i commented something about me getting pissed off at Pokemon X, but it has no relevance. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Well done, it was worth the wait. Don't stress yourself about making these, we're happy to have you as a person and as the creator of Starter Squad. Thank you for all of your time and effort, and like I said before, it was worth the wait. And now when I type in this comment it's partly laggy, but that's fine.  *After Thoughts* Oh my god Pidgeotto is probably dead.

Amazing!! Squirtle is level 98!!!   But, Charmander actually died…  Caterpie is gone  Squirtle is Wartortle  The world is destroyed literally  I saw Mewtwo fighting MissingNo in a flashback  And what tf happened to Bulbasaur  My prediction: Wartortle finds his ways to the gods and he convinces them to go back in time so he can stop this all from ever happening, and he does that by giving chimchar body as a gift.
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED
Excited.

i got goosepumps when i saw the notification
Episode 10 of Starter Squad is finally finished.  Thank you to all those involved and thank you for your extreme patience.  This took me roughly twice as much time to make as I'd anticipated it taking, but in the end it came out pretty dang close to how it looked in my head.  Please enjoy and/or be upset by the video and be sure to Like and Subscribe!  I'm going to write some spoiler-y stuff below now, so make sure you've watched the whole episode before reading the rest of this comment.   SPOILERS    .......     SPOILERS     .....    SPOILERS    ...   Hah!  Didn't expect that, did you!?  DID YOU!?!  I didn't begin this series with the expectation that it would go into Sinnoh, but I made the decision long ago (around Episode 6 in 2015/2016) and have since building up to the Sinnoh Arc for Squirtle in Episodes 7-9.  Episode 10 of Starter Squad was written in late 2019/early 2020 and its production cycle spanned the 2020 global pandemic.  Hats off to everyone that worked on this during a strict quarantine.  Additionally, during the production of this episode, remakes of the Gen 4 Pokemon games were announced.  I'm not sure if this was pure coincidence or simply parallel thinking between me and Nintendo.  I have, after all, been completely indoctrinated by their products, so it only makes sense that my actions would parallel theirs.  The timing felt very strange and nerve-wracking to me when it was announced.  But hopefully this will open up a whole new viewer base, and people will be more likely to find this series as a result.   If you're reading this before Ep11's release, rest assured that I'm going somewhere with this weird plot shift.  I intend for Starter Squad to be a 12 episode series.  There are two episodes left for me to make, and I do not plan to make a second "season".  Please believe me when I say that I have no idea when I'll be able to release the next episode.  I often lose sight of how long things take and often run into unexpected problems.  Additionally, in every single episode thus far, I have attempted to animate something I've never tried before in my life and always step into uncharted territory in order to expand my skill set.  I am going to attempt to make two more episodes and be more efficient with the production process, but I have no idea what that will look like at this time.  I did about 85% of the animation of this episode entirely by myself, and I definitely need to expand my team for the next one.  Feel free to contact me if you're experienced with both character animation and Blender and are interested in working on the series.  If you'd like to support the series and receive regular updates on the next Episode's production, visit Patreon.com/shippiddge. If you enjoy looking at the things I type, you can follow me on Twitter (twitter.com/shippiddge).  Thank you all sincerely for watching.  - Pierce "Shippiddge" Shipp
