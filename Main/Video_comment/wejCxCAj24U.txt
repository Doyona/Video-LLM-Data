Apple sucks and is over priced.
😂😂😂 thinnest bezels? wasnt there a samsung with an infinity screen or no bezels already? Man these iphomes get to much hype.
Has anyone noticed the later the model the poorer you get.
Okay
please giveaway i phone 15 pro max ...
❤❤❤❤❤
love you sir
The significant battery life increase would be the main reason I would upgrade from my 14 pro-max, but without that I will be hanging on, the usb c change doesn't bother me, but I will wait longer and hopefully they will get rid of that terrible magic island which takes up more screen distraction wise than the original so called notch (but knowing apple I doubt that). All the best.
I was going to buy it but not now because they are not updating the battery
I hate the edge design, I’ll stick with my 14 Pro Max.
You've got nothing.  Apple have got nothing.  Stop the excited mindlessness over a glorified overpriced phone with 90% of it's features never being used.   Apple are playing you.
Hope IPHONE15 has the periscope telephoto
honestly i dont even use the volume button, i feel like we dont need any buttons
So far not impressed with the upgrades yet from the 14 pro. The had 4 weeks to wow me. Let’s go Apple
good news for my wallet if fast charging doesn't come with the iphone 15 pro I'm not buying that phone.
People need to understand that Smartphone changes have become incremental because the technology has reached a point of maturity where the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. In the early years, there were significant breakthroughs in terms of screen quality, processing power, and connectivity. Nowadays, improvements are harder to achieve without resorting to revolutionary changes that might disrupt user familiarity and ecosystems. Manufacturers focus on refining existing features, enhancing camera capabilities, optimizing software, and extending battery life. The market's saturation also plays a role; companies aim to retain existing customers rather than relying solely on attracting new ones, leading to iterative improvements rather than radical shifts..there’s no doubt that iPhone is a great product and is durable
Will it be called as 15 PM or Ultra?
A programable button i think i saw that in older phones in early 2010s
Used to use iPhone, got HuaweiP60 Pro, the 88w charger charge from 0-100% in 31mins. Aperture 1.4 - 4 ten level change. Kunlun glass can smash walnuts. And many more functions apple does not have.
So they changed the least bit of aesthetics and jacked up the price like crazy.
This is great! Are they launching 4 phones, airpods and MacBook?
Thank you for adding chapeters
That looks boring... I'll keep my 14pro max
Overpriced overhyped
You forgot to mention what colours iphone 15 pro comes in 😕
I have always gone for pro models to cut out 128g and having 256g base storage is just a no no for me! I doubt that increasing price will help boost sales when all people are thinking about now is how to survive with rising bills, rent, food costs ect…
Sounds like TikTok will load a little faster.
Imma going to wait for iPhone 17 or 18 series to save money lol
Yes indeed the tsmc 3nm yield is critical
Wow....
I like your videos, but you should avoid your pronouncements about the economy.  You've said more than once in the recent past that we were "in a recession," which never happened, and in this video you said that Apple was doing things because of "hard economic times."  Stick to tech, where your opinions are fact based and helpful.
With that 70 to 80% yield results, does that mean we should get a healthy increase in both single core and multi core scores. And my Apple what bold pricing you’re going for.
So the 15 Pro models are just gonna be made out of titanium, new action button, a new CPU, USB type-C, and slightly smaller bezels which doesn't matter cause of the big ol pill shape cutout for dynamic gimmick.  That's not much of an upgrade imo.
Time to dump my iphone 14 pro max and get the iphone 15.
That is amazing…… Sales are down for IPhones and yet they want to increase their prices. Doesn’t make sense.
I am an android user I was planning for the iPhone 15 but when I saw the Gay flag I will never ever pay an iPhone forever!!! I am done I don't care and u will not have my money!!!
Iphone is just milking money at this point. All of these are in the andrioid community. Like my xiaomi 12 pro has all of these features and they're nothing special. Those bezels are not thin at all if you're going to spend fucking rent money on a phone. I might have little issues with my xiaomi but its way better than 2.5k€ compared to 600€ i have no regrets buying this master piece.
I’m not getting it now
My 14 battery is garbage
Finally my z fold 3 on life support
I don’t know it just doesn’t seem like there’s that much improvement to drop nearly 1.2k on a phone. I’m still using the 12 and it’s great honestly. I don’t need dynamic peninsula and the usb c is nice but not 1.2k dollars nice. The thinner edges look nice on paper but honestly I don’t even notice it much after use.
Of course...... its the same fkin design
That as a fast year !
About time they get the action button like galaxy
If 256 is the base storage, that will take some of the sting out of the $200 price increase.  USB-C fine since the iPads are USB-C not a big deal.  Removing the ring/silent button is way overdue.  Bad design difficult to operate as read the orange bar….should have had another click down on volume to silence ringer.  Plan on keeping the 14 and using my very good condition I13 as the trade. 14PM will be the new spare.
Can't wait for this to drop so I can finally upgrade to an 11 or maybe 12.
APPLE STOPPED INNOVATING AFTER THE IPHONE XR !
I honestly don’t need a new phone still rocking 12 model. Unless it’s either crap itself which it hasn’t for since I first bought it on the week after it came out. I’ll wait and see what it’s all like but I’d probably wait til 16 then I’ll buy it.
Excited for an action button? LMAO
Should I get a iPhone 14 pro or pro max or wait for the iPhone 15? Is the iPhone 15 the same and not much upgrades?
I was waiting to change my iPhone 14 pro max for the iPhone 15 pro max but I don't see a "big" difference. I think I better wait for the 16th. 😢
I’m upgrading from an iPhone SE (2020) that has a battery life of 13 hours to an iPhone 15 Plus that has at least 26 hours per charge so that’s a huge upgrade to me😭👌. Been rocking this one for 3 years and 3 months.
Was thinking to update my iPhone 13, but actually do it is not worthy, unless they compel us with the new updates which make our phone slower 👎
Things are getting where they can’t do much to phones anymore . Upgrades are minor and not noticed in the real world
Actually this phone did not impress me, nothing new, all that he is talking is about frame color and new button, very disappointed 👎
If we buy a phone, what percentage goes into China's military, what percentage goes into a new missile silo?
Finally they don’t do it in October 💀💀
Who cares
Im thinking about switching over to iPhone. Should I wait until the 15 drops or get the 14 pro and wait until theres significant changes between the models?
Apples sales are down because of the price for these iPhones. So let’s raise the price up.🤦‍♂️
I don't understand why anyone would want to buy this crap phone, it's basically the same shet  every year but more expensive, just bigger number in it's name
should i upgrade from iphone 11 base?
You can buy an an external  2 TB SSD for 90 dollars why buy it internal on your phone? What would you even use that for
omg another person with the same leaks that everyone is talking abouit and this guy drags it for 10mins
I’m so happy with my iPhone 13 Pro
Buy samsung s24 ultra👌👍
Who need 2TB
Now they are forcing you to upgrade basically when it costs them next to nothing to upgrade storage.  So they decided to copy the Bixby button to call it something else huh.  Apple brains be too dumb to add extra things I don't think it's a good idea
Nice one, rounded edge design for more comfort is my fav upgrade, usbc major too!
I have an IPhone Xr, I was going to go for the 14 but saw too many similarities with the 13 and decided to wait. I’m excited for this model and can’t wait to have a phone that doesn’t lag 😂
Well coming from an XR, of course I'm going to update lol.
Im so excited to use the new flex screen on my new Samsung Z Flip 5 so its time to switch to the better side Max
Who cares about a chip when every phone is already fast enough
Apple iPhone had played out to me its just too basic
I definitely don't want it haardd pass
There is one iPhone thing that needs to change.  The volume button, being used as a camera shutter button to take a picture is GREAT... But, with the power button being right across from it, means I am always either accidentally turning off the phone, or grabbing a screenshot when I want to take a picture.
I just hope the new frame isn't glossy, I don't use cases and cannot stand that the current outer band is a finger print magnet.
well, no stacked battery, no fast charging, no 8g of ram, what else can we get from this year’s upgrade? Price increase?
Isn't it interesting that Apple got rid of so many buttons in favor of a touch screen display, but now a new button is a big deal?
In reference to Greg Doucette as soon as they drop the 15 pro I’m throwing my iPhone 12 harder than last time 😂, I done replaced my iPhone 12 atleast 4 times which about 2K… IPhone 15 pro here I comeeeee
What a waste of money to be honest. I have a Samsung A5 phone for 7 years and now i am looking at upgrading my phone. The iphone 15 is what I'm looking into but the features just seem a bit ordinary to me. The chip is another story though. That is basically the ONLY positive selling point to me. Everything else is just quality of life features etc.
Will stay with my 14…
I love how apple slowly puts features on their phones that androids have had for years and act like it's original. Dynamic island/always on display and now this customizable button is just a few
Nothing to warrant an upgrade from the 14. Not even close.
It’s going to remain a useless button for most people in my opinion. They need a front camera shutter button and IR shutter button. IR sensor should only activated by a press of a button rather then mapping your face by a time base.
9:13 min seeing 11pro reminded me how great that phone felt in hand and was perfect size, apple needs to go back to that size dimensions and fit the biggest bezel less screen an best tech in that form factor
When it comes to the chips, apple invested lots of money in tsmc so they give apple what they want
I have an iPhone Xs so I'm definitely upgrading!
I am looking forward to getting the 15 pro cause of the action button and reason I say that is cause there’s moments that happen around me that’s worth catching on camera and if I can quickly tap the left side of my phone makes it more smoother and don’t have to hold the camera button then on top of that with us switching over to Type-C is the best idea faster charging and now people can’t use my phone charger if they have the older versions of the iPhone so it kinda puts us in two different areas
Ih no upgraded battery, no 8gb of RAM, then why do they increase the price to $1300???
Also we won't get 8gb of RAM, and slowly step by step this iPhone is getting more and more boring...
They should release info on gta 6 aswell tbh . 15 should have more camera options obviously.
your clickbait is desperate
he can’t wait for the action button? 😂 get a life dude
who needs 2 Tera on a phone???😮
Not going to upgrade, thank you 😅
Stacked battery no? Huh. I’m still upgrading regardless, my iPhone X been a bit slow and laggy, it’s time
Be ready for recession dont spend money for these things now please save money thats important even am also apple fan but coming years save your money otherwise enjoy the consequences
#maxtech - Can you please review fold5 and flip 5 … and please compare flip 5 with Motorola razer ultra and Fold 5 with google fixed fold .. please waiting
Wait for the king 👑 Samsung s24 ultra
Omg yes I was hoping they would do a 2TB
Another crap by apple 🍏 Only change the processor and increase price this is the invention by apple
There are still people in Europe that are desperatly trying to get a 14 pro or pro max, but there is still a shortage of those pro phones… so normal that they don’t get the same sale numbers 😂
whats the new color?
Too much talk about apple making money blah blah blah! The average consumer doesn’t give two poops if apple makes money. Consumers want to be able to afford the iPhone.
Great news. I need my TSMC stock to go up. Shame (according to rumours) that 3nm will only be for the pro though.
Don’t worry guys. Then they will introduce iPhone more rumours will stay rumours for future iPhones. Nothing revolutionary and extraordinary will happen at this iPhone 15. Same as with past iPhones. Remove pink glasses from your eyes and look at the world.
Bro, you're still going to the apple store and replacing the phone 😂
I just wanna see better video making capabilities! Video Camera video camera video camera!
No matter how expensive it gets an iPhone has some dumb things, especially the basics that are done right in an ordinary Android smartphone.
Perfect im gonna get the 14 pro in December
We‘ll probably be confronted with a price that isn‘t affordable for me for the version I‘d like to have. 😔
Titanium will reduce heat too so win win
Yall are crazy in the comments none of this is confirmed
Groundbreaking
Launch announcements are always on a Tuesday.
iPhone = horrible glares and lights in photos and videos from the camera module, we hope they can FINALLY fix that
It needs better battery life
With the new powerful chip, native BitTorrent built into iOS is long overdue to move files on our mesh networks.
I will upgrade to ip15 pro max  From ip Xs 3)
What about the periscope zoom lense you didn't mention that.
Isheep cries a loud😭
the fact that the pro max is $200 is disgusting. Tbh im getting sick of apple. They're getting lazy and annoying. The damn things been looking the same for the past 4 years.
I currently have the 14 pro max came from the iPhone 12. I can upgrade my phone at no extra cost. Will I be upgrading to 15 pro max, who knows as phones are so expensive nowadays 😂
2TB Pro Max model $2,000+?!?!
Woooooooo a new action button! 🎉🎉 Earth shattering and exciting news! 🫨
The biggest thing I want out of the iPhone 15 is a better camera!  I been leaning toward the Samsung S23 for that reason. I have a iPhone 12 Pro and been waiting for a  significant reason to upgrade. I don’t want the iPhone Pro max trying to carry that in my pocket at the gym or out for a bike ride. I’m in Cape Canaveral & would love to capture better videos of these rocket launches. These little changes haven’t gotten me that excited. But that’s my opinion. Anybody feel like I do?
Do I have to preorder the iPhone so I can pick it up from store on the release date.
Me with IPhone Xs 😂😂😂
hahahaha
watching on xs max 🫶🏻
Boring iphone same thing
What chip will be used for iphone 15 base model?
I was really looking forward to this new iPhone, but if they have a better battery but just decided to remove it, forget it.
2tb is great if you do heavy loading and big file transfers and storing, but for mee it is a lot.
The phone to get this year is definitely the regular iphone 15 or the plus!
il wait iPhone 20 pro
How come you’re using magsafe with your apple watch ? 9:27
If the user likes the current location for the mute switch and desires to keep the same function assigned to the same location, then it seems to me that it will be easier to accidentally mute your phone with the action button than with the current switch.  Not good.
What are trade ins normally at launch?
Just minor changes? The button? And camera ? Same body design? Applee pleasee..😑
Better to use Atleast 4 years the last upgraded iPhone then only change .. Bkos of battery percentage is low ..   I have 11pro — i suppose to change iPhone 16 pro 🤣🤣😊
the iphone would be superior if it had night vision capability on its camera. One day someone's got to make it.
I think it’s best to upgrade the iphone after 4 years. if you guys remember, the ‘significant’ upgrade last time was from 7 series to 12 series which is 4 generations. so if you have 12, you better keep it until at least the 16. don’t rush to buy the 15, as we all hear from Max it’s not actually a huge upgrade ((AGAIN))
Can’t do 6GB RAM again
Battery is the deal breaker. I don't care how fancy your gizmo is, it needs the juice.
The A17 chipset is going to be blazing fast
The twitter, or X user🤣🤣🤣
Oh, the action button will replace the mute switch? The mute button will be missed but letting me do whatever I want to it is a feature. Something like what I expected the Samsung Bixby button to be
Amar boga!!
What's the big black thing at the top of the screen ?
Ok, let’s move on to iPhone 16 please. Skipping this one. 😢😂
might be getting the plus the way these prices look lol
All i need is USB C at thunderbolt speed
just pretend like the iPhone 15 Pro models dont have a 128 GB option (how the price is raised)
I was hoping for faster charging alongside the USBC addition. That’s arguably needed more than USBC. Cause 27W is nothing compared to the competition.
Most excited about 6X optical zoom! And if they increase the sensor above the 10mp that the Galaxy s-series has for its 10X zoom, even better. Go Apple! I'm buying it!
My iPhone 12pro is still great. The only thing we need in an iPhone is better battery life.
Too many iPhones. In the past it was only one and different capacity
I guess I'm one in a small minority, but wished they made a 15 pro mini. It's sad to see them ditch the mini series, but in my view that is also due to reducing the specs in certain parts for the mini series, instead of having a pro mini on par with it's bigger siblings besides the size difference. From a one hand usability standpoint I wish they made them even smaller than the mini's been.
Ridiculous upgrade
Apple rotten to the core! How the hell can you release the same frigging design, 4 or 5 years in a row!!! And the biggest joke.... the apple heads will gooooo buy it!  You can not make this up 😂😂😂😂
Honestly, wtf cares about poor Apple and their profit margins.  Why do you keep mentioning that?
1.5 mm thinner is insane 😂
I don't know about people putting 2tb of information on their phone but for a MacBook or iPad I can see! Wish they would start both with 1TB of SSD to start up to 8TB or more!
Ok so nothing new
"The action button that is fun to play with."  Are we freaken bored nowadays and have nothing to look forward to other than the action button?  Every video I see on youtube talks about the action button.  Man, Apple really implanted something in our heads.
Here we go with typical Max Tech's "Confirmed" clickbaits.
Can someone answer this for me, the stack battery’s are gonna go on the 16 now but with the 15 still have those battery upgrades we saw on the  chart a few weeks ago?
Interesting to hear why we should be exited about Apple Margins xD
They need to be looking for ways to boost innovation
I hope it gonna improve also thé main caméra
Still upset that it’s not going to be coming in red. I’m still tempted to upgrade though because of the USB C and thinner bezels.
Without stacked batteries, the price increase isn't worth it. Looks like I'm sticking with the 13 Pro Max.
Can’t wait for the surgical augmentation feature!
I think we still are going to get more battery life, if it has the new processor and they still may have somehow put more mAh. I hope so, nowadays that I use to shoot and edit videos a lot with my iphone, I really need more battery, and hopefully less screen dimming too. Bet
iPhone Foldable please! 🙌🏻
What happened to the periscope zoom lens?  Is that not coming now on the 15Pro Max?
Not for the masses, too expansive
You have no info on the camera...? Arrggghhhh!
I’m so happy Apple has a strong relationship with Taiwan.
2TB finna cost 3000$ in Norway 💀
Why do you keep stopping word by word while talking.. its very annoying to hear..  You stress on Every second word ..   Work on your taking skills..  This is not a troll.. pls take it as a constructive feedback.
I had a feeling that the stack battery stuff wouldn’t be coming out until the 16 Series or 17. Save your dough  on the 2024 16 or 2025 17 Series. If you have an iPhone 12 model and higher you shouldn’t be tempted with the idea of upgrading unless you have a 64GB storage.
They will make more profit because they are selling them at a higher price, but there gonna be a lot less people buying them. So in the end they will probably make less overall. 999 USD is crazy, but 1199 is insane
Maybe the battery capacity or life will increase;  its just that the technology will be the same ( maybe )
Portland, JAMAICA in the Building!!!  👑🇯🇲🔥💥🌟⭐💯💎
I NEED SMALL SIZE PHONE with a battery that can last a whole day 🤣😭 I love iPhone 13 mini I just wish apple can figure out how they can put battery that can last a day in a small phone size 😊
When he said some people just leave it on silent forever I felt that.
for those who own 14 and wants to get 15 your life is sad
Has there been anything said about the regular iPhone 15 having a 120hz screen instead of just having that on the Pro models?
So basically, the iPhone 16 is going to be what the iPhone 15 SHOULD be, but apple doesn’t have enough genuine changes to add to this iPhone without sacrificing next year’s sales so they split it in 2.
Very nice
It doesn't make sense to increase the price . There are still people who need 128gb only and wont wanna pay more for a 256 gb variant
Really if there is no significant updates to share, just hush
Disappointed in the battery capacity increases not happening now. Battery life with this bumps in capacity combined with the 3nm processor would’ve been insane.
I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max and I have yet to see anything game changer to make me upgrade. I am almost to the point I am ready to jump ship where other companies with better tech.
90 hz display for regular iphone 15?
Still won’t change my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple really knows how to work smart and step up their scheme but not harder and less than quality iPhones nowadays! 🤣🤣🤣
I wish they made flat models for people who are not so much into cameras. I would rather have a flat back, no cut-out screen, and for alien's sake a smaller device...
I'm excited for USB C, the new periscope camera and the new action button.
⚡️What about the battery? 14 pro battery was BAD
Why no fingerscan?? Thats the best theire is.  Only if your fingers are wet okay, then its better with face id but i do not use my phone with wet fingers ;).  I love fingerscan.  And Apple brings nothing new. I bought the fold 5 now from samsung, thats something new for me.
Thanks for the info…I don’t see enough to justify my upgrading my 14 pro max
Same shit for the 6th year in a row but yall still going to buy 💀🐑
Slower sales, i wonder why... iPhone 12, 13, 14, all the same with minor differences. Best deal is to just buy one every 4 to 5 years also because of the ridiculous price (and ecologic footprint).
Got a 13 mini. If it had a better camera…. I think I’m headed back to the pro max series.  I would kill for a iPen, you know, like the spen for Samsung ultras. I have iPad, but it’s not the same. As an office worker, I can’t just have it with me 100% of the time. An iPen would solve so many issues for me.
I would like a light on the button so I know if the setting I mapped it to is on or off.  Now I don't use an iPhone, but I just think that'd be neat.
wow, stacked battery was one of the features that was going to make me upgrade. sad to see its not coming.
Apple needs to make a flip phone and a folded tab phone or tablet phone. If they had a tablet that you could answer while you’re out they make a lot of money but they need to flip phone everybody’s buying a flip phone and then forward because you spend the money for an apple you can have a folded phone, but if you love Apple you can’t people are changing because they need cheaper ways and they like to fold they like to flip so that’s why it is
Currently still using XS Max and wondering should I finally upgrade to 15 Pro Max or perhaps wait one more year as I still get ios 17 this year 😆
i love the current silent switch.. use it many times during the day.
When are they going to fix the airdrop waiting forever issue?
That’s really disappointing news about the stacked battery technology. Does this mean we won’t be getting increased MaH on the new lineup as previously reported?
No new battery life. . . No new phone for me!
I have the 13pm and it still works great but my battery life is starting to weaken as the months go by. So I'm really considering on getting the 15pro just to get a fresh start as well as the new camera lens!
The ‘action’ button will be a novelty for all of 5 minutes and will then be forgotten about for the life of the device…I like the physical mute switch, it’s robust and has one purpose. If the rumours are correct, there really is nothing that would have me rushing out to get the 15 pro…Huge disappointment that the red colour isn’t likely to happen…Skip year for me I guess
This is very disappointing I have a 13pro in mint condition but I was gonna upgrade to the 15PM cus of battery & weight now I'm thinking I'll just wait for the 16 dang this sucks
Why would someone get a 2TB storage on smartphones? When they can get that on Pc or Laptop
Dang, The battery life was the reason I was going to upgrade 😭 guess I’m waiting till next year to upgrade from a 12. got to get the best bang for my buck. Apple definitely dropped the ball on this
i have my 12 pro max and 13 pro max honestly still feels great…
Not a massive upgrade for current iPhone 14  users.. but I'm coming from android so it will be ace.. lol
I will be honest, doesn't sound like there is too much going on this year. I'll be honest the biggest jump from generation to generation in the past 5 years still in my opinion was the Xs to 11 pro's, but the 14's weren't that great from everything I have heard and the 15's don't really sound too different to be honest
still no 90hz display in a 799$ apple iPhone! :(
ive been using a iphone 6 since my 10 broke becuase i decided to wait for the 15 pro  because of the rumored bigger battery instead of going for the 14 pro,  sad to hear that it might not happend, but might as well wait a few more weeks now :D
Wacthing this from my iPhone XS Max. Have been waiting for a new iPhone with USB-C before I update and now it finally seems to happen 🤩
I will stick to my beloved iPhone 13 mini for at least another year! Still hoping for an iPhone 16 mini Pro …! 🤞😉
I remember when Apple used to innovate with revolutionary features such as crazy gpu upgrades for unmatched gaming, the Retina display, tremendous camera upgrades, facetime, phenomenal speaker upgrades etc. Apple innovation ended after Steve Jobs passed away and the last innovative year they had was with the iPhone X. That had huge leaps in EVERY single area. Battery life, cpu, gpu, camera, screen, speakers, Face ID, and the list goes on and on. It literally shook the industry so much that it still has an impact today, as all phone companies have copied the Notch design. And I mean literally ALL. Now we’re at the point where we’re going crazy over them turning the notch into a hole punch and calling it a feature and a switch being turned into a button😢. Incremental updates not worth the upgrade and certainly not worth the price they sell it for. These phone are more of a 10, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10,4, 10.5 kind of upgrade than a whole new numbered model. There’s not much of a noticeable performance difference between my 10s max and a 14pro. It’s not night and day like it used to be with the older models yet people are not only failing to notice this, they are also incentivizing Apple to not innovate as Apple knows that they can satisfy y’all by adding one percent more battery life every year and still raising the price because y’all will buy it anyway 😂😂😂
I hate 15ProMax has different features with 15Pro 😢
Please, who needs 2TB of storage on their phone? Those people store their 💩 in the iCloud (or else) anyhow and will change their iPhones after 1 year.
I honestly think the 15 PM would be the most selling smartphone of the year
Apple and the car industry are same. When sales are low they increase the price.
Meh. The battery tech was the reason to switch for me. Another year then.
iPhone 20 will be better than this iPhone 15, I will just wait lol
Nothing in this video is exciting (apple), not the actual channel and it's production, that, as always, is top notch!
This is very boring 🥱. I mean Max Tech content is great, just Apple stopped serious innovating.
I want usb c
Some people say Apple is generous on mot increasing the price for years.  I would like to say that when Apple tries to increase the price, that’s when the price is fair.  In other words, a consumer will always going to buy an overpriced iPhone.
Who confirmed what ?
No bigger batteries? Jeeeeeeees‘… that 15 pro max would have been the perfect phone.
My iPhone 13 Pro Max still works great
Great video!  I’m looking forward to upgrading from my 13 PM because I’m running out of storage space.  But also, in the trailer, they mention periscope lens.  What is this and will it be in the pro max?  Will it allow us to have Samsung’s zoom capability?
Since the iPhone is finally going USB-C I don’t understand why Apple doesn’t just use the “M” chips across the board of their entire product lineup.
Saving good tech? iPhone bros coping hard. Stop simping
Hope the 15 Pro Max is worth it. My 12 Pro Max keep overheating when I’m using social media and YouTube. And the battery life is so bad in 5G conditions
Not upgrading the battery life is trash  My iPhone 12 Pro Max just got water damage and I had to "downgrade" to my old 11 Pro Max and it's crazy how much better than battery life on the 11 Pro Max was...  Not sure why but it's a good sort of time for this to happen because I also did notice how much better the rounded edges feel on your hand. I have no choice but to upgrade now though with my 12 Pro Max going bad...  Maybe I should buy a used 14 Pro Max for a year and then buy the iPhone 16 in a year...that might be a good option
Bummed about the stacked battery tech likely being out of the picture here.  At this point, for me, USB-C is the big seller, but it's not worth the expected price increase and trade-in decrease to me.  I might get the 14 Pro Max now.
Will the LiDAR sensor be improved on the 15pro max? I use my iPhone for building surveys so an improvement would be welcome.
The Apple and TSMC story is so delightful!
A17 might be good but A18 would be even better. The 12 pro also used a new more efficient process node but didn't do that much better than the 13 pro which used a second generation of that same process node. The second generation of 5nm on iPhone 13s were so good thatbit actually made a difference just between the 12s and 13s significant  My personal advice is wait for 16. If 16 and 15 have little differences then get the 15. If they are totally different then get the 16. You don't lose either way
I'm going to give up the iPhone for two reasons: $1300 for iPhone 15 Pro Max price and because it's boring.
I wish they got rid of the hideous camera bump instead. 😚 Samsung S23 looks so much better.
If it has a action button i will not buy it the switch is the only one that makes iPhone old school and its use full and i t you accidentally press it instead of switch which is reliable 😢😢😢
I feel like they delayed almost everything for the 16 so I guess I’ll have to delay buying till the 16 🤷‍♂️
Apple wants us to have courage regarding the sound/silent switch lol!
Is the iPad mini 7 also released?
It's all about the stock price.
I have been using Android ever since i own a phone, is it a good time to move to iOS iPhone 15?  Pls give ur opinion...
No periscope no buy!
I’m on a 13 pro max with beta…it’s tempting to upgrade but I might wait
it may launch sept 12 or 13. Title: Launch date confirmed 👨‍🦯
I really wanted to upgrade because of more battery capacity. I guess I can still wait for another year and stick with my 12 Pro Max. 💀
I am looking forward to everything! Issue will be the biggest upgrade ever! I definitely have the money to get a new iPhone in September. I will definitely be tuned in for the announcement and plan on pre-ordering if possible.
If their no usb c I'm keeping my 12 Pro Max for another year 😅
It's funny a button that was used awhile back.. no one talks about it.. Apple does it and its the coolest thing ever!!! Lol
Apple: IPhone sales are down.Let’s increase the price now
bro someone paypal me some money
I cant wait!!
Love from Bangladesh ❤❤🇧🇩🇧🇩
As always, great and fun content from Max Tech
Hi Max Tech, my iPhone 14 Pro has overheating issues, scrolling stutter in apps like Twitter and Spotify, and it has touch lag in some games like Hit the Island.  Also, the daily battery life isn’t great and the camera has sometimes over processing and sometimes lag in-app. The Apple Store Employee said nothing is wrong besides maybe software issues, but the updates didn’t fix those problems (since I my first version that I used of iOS 16.3 until now in iOS 16.6).  Also I have my previous iPhone 11.  I debate if I should:   1. trade it in to the 15 Pro (since I prefer the Regular Pro size over the Pro Max and the it will have bigger and better battery life from the rumors. 2. Trade in my older regular iPhone 11 to a brand new regular iPhone 13. 3. Buy a refurbished or a brand new open box or renewed iPhone 13 Pro from either eBay or third party retailers.  Which option should I choose? Thanks.
Nice
Awesome🎉
