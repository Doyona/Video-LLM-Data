This aged very well...Werner and Van de Beek is the best summer transfer🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone wanting Werner and shitting on Chilwell 😅 didn’t aged well
Timo Werner ay..... Rory what are your thoughts on Timo now?
The Timo Werner comments aged like milk
The irony of this video after so many months. It is what it is
This whole video aged like milk
the werner thing aged well
City guy talks gang shit
Expressions is mad
Arsenal are addressing their defensive problems he said 😂  Spoke before Villa turned up and played them off the park in their own stadium 😂
This spurs fan is so annoying af 🙄 😒
I liked this coz of X
well done lads! check out our transfer review- https://youtu.be/lFpiahcduVo
The best signing was Thiago by Liverpool. But Chelsea won the transfer window by a mile.
HERE AFTER WE GOT PARTEY 🙂🙂😉🙂🙂😉
I can't understand a word this liverpool man is saying
Meehhhh Chelsea look at your defence money not so spent well 😂😂😂
Expressions is so extra, I wouldn’t be surprised if these lot wouldn’t take him seriously.
Whos here after Hojberg dominated the midfield against United
Well wished this was done after the window closed
can someone explain to me why no back= miley cyrus fc
If they would do a re-run of this video, there would still be no one representing united cause woodward and the glazers still mucking around
This aged terribly
This city fan looks like the music teacher from sex education. (Netflix)
GARETH BALE
Chelsea getting straight smacked by west brom 🤣, what happened to all those signings lol.
auoar will be the best signing
Chillwell is shit, Arsenal payed half the price for Tierney and he is way better, Leicester completely pulled Chelsea’s pants down with this one
spurs are fucking shit
Ben chilwell that a waste of 50 mil on a injury prone left back there are so many left backs out there that were cheaper example telles tagliafico and reguilon
There can only be one answer to this question.
Do they like cut parts out
They could have waited a good 2 weeks before making this video
I get his points on chilwell being english, them meeding him & ake &maguire, but i think Tierney is the closest thing (Robertson, whos a different story considering where he was when lvpl bought him), & they paid half that, hes probably the 2nd best fullback in the league not fat behind robbo, came from celtic (in eu & didnt need to sell), & fills the brit quota, so yes che needed him, but not for that price, but thay always pay huge prices, & like lvpl, manage to sell what they dont want for large fees, whereas man utd & arsenal are horrible at selling nowadays! As we saw with arsenal last year, who everyone agreed had the best window in the epl, it doesn't necessarily mean a lot!
I think ziyech was signing of the summer honestly
Mendy from Rennes... Just cos of shite Kepa is....
It would have made more sense to make this video after the window closed and all transfers were done🤦🏾‍♂️
Spurs man is a comedian 😂
One question  Is the liverpool fan the one that called mane the world's best player in the world
The Chelsea fan is a fucking retard
No mention of Everton?
So good to see a proper Liverpool fan on one of these instead of some wet wipe from down south who started supporting a couple of years ago.
Why did everton not get mentioned in this
It makes me so happy as a city fan that we've got steven as our fan representation just a fucking solid bloke
What these Chelsea clown is talking about 😂 75m kepa,  50mln shevchenko,  50mln torres are Flops.  40m for ake is good price for Dutch international.
Stop doing videos like this before the window closes
That scouse lad is awesome, talks so sensibly
And now Liverpool have signed Thiago and Jota
thiago
Wait for the window to end ffs
Imagine not mentioning everton
Thiago 🔴😎
Miley Cyrus FC hahahahaha.
50 mil for chilwell is a joke. Ake, decent player but good luck to him. Its not easy at the top and the pressure to perform every week. Anyone remember how good John Stones was at Everton, or Maguire at Leicester?
Did this too early jota and thiaho
That spurs fan hating on arsenal
Liverpool supporter here....this video has aged well in just 6 days.....lololol.... Thiago and Jota.
James Rodriguez on a free
Signing of the summer thiago alcantara
Well look how wrong they are about Liverpool😂😂😂
Every one has done good business that they needed except man u
Why cant I view the channel
James Rodriguez. . .
Liverpool after 2 days video goes live : So you were saying...
Let's do this video now. Bale and Reguillon
Relegated team doesn’t matter. A good player’s a good player
skinny Jeans and very short pants: what happened to Lads these Days.
Literally 48 hours after this video, Liverpool sign Thiago and Jota with Kabak also likely
Arsenal signing Partey and Aouar, Liverpool have got Thiago and Jota, the spuds with bale and Doherty, Chelsea singing everyone 😂 and united potentially singing sancho, What a season this could be
I tell you what I am not excited about.... da mans shorts on tv
Spurs had a dumb-good transfer window, got Bale on loan (who's injured until November btw) and paying 50% of his wages (300k), Regulion on the other hand is a very smart signing
If this vid was made 3 days later expressions would be fuming
6:06 expressions saying That Pepe on one wing Willian on the other and Aubamyang upfront doesn’t scare him and that he would switch Aubamyang for Zaha. I am sorry but has Aubamyang not scored the most goals by anyone in the league since he joined
I hate this liverpool fan, with his accent 🤮
Could of sworn that spurs fan last time I saw him was in a liverpool top
Does signing Thiago alcantara and Diogo jota classify as good signings 😉
Done before liverpool's double swoop on the 18th of September.
Doherty is as big an Arsenal fan as Kane!
Jota and Thiago overnight
This Chelsea guy is so deluded man fr
Rory, the shorts, stop it.
Thiago. End of.
How much money did the owners of top club take out from the club? https://youtu.be/67I99kyEuOU
There is no justification for us spending 50m on Chillwell
Paid the same for Chilwell as they did for Werner... I like Chilwell, but he’s not going to improve them defensively.
Just wanna point out thank god a scouser is there finally debating for liverpool
If we get Thomas Partay nobody has anything on our transfer window. We’ve got Saiba and Gabriel, we signed Pablo Mari on permanent deal, that’s three defenders. Willian the veteran. If we now solidify the midfield with a Thomas Partay, we are practically a finished article. If we add Aouar, that’s taking the piss. And if by any stretch of imagination Zaha comes in on loan, Arsenal fans will start receiving death threats for supporting a dream team!
Re film this again and am sure the answers will be very different, up the reds
Thiago and Jota now at liverpool
That spurs fan talks complete rubbish, signing of the summer DVB??
This Tottenham fan is your typical liberal, thinking he knows everything and is superior to everyone, yet his club hasn’t won a thing since forever. Childish
Lol
In telles we're getting a left back three times better than chilwell at a third of the price
Watching This After Liverpool Signed Thiago And Jota
This City fan is shocking... acting like he's just discovered Willian.
Anyone here after Liverpool signed Thiago and agreed a deal for jota🤣
This Liverpool fan is actually really good in all fairness
I like that Tottenham guy confident
this man just said he's more worried about zaha than auba+pepe+willian.... delusional
Thiaaaaaaago
Thiago
Expression u bought Chilwell because he's English ya'll needed to fill that English quater😂🤣😂😂
Don't compare Ake to fucking Chilwell ahahah chilwell is another tom Cleverley, bang average, just looks good in training. Average going forward, shocking in the defence, just has a decent barnet and even that's questionable
Tottenham have problems. Bale and Reguilon paper over the cracks. Centre backs will get found out this season.
miley cyrus fc hahahahahah expressions is insane
https://youtu.be/JDfdImnjCrU
Tierney was half the price of chill well and is about 5x better
Chelsea obviously did the best
Liverpool has signed thiago, tsimikas and jota should Liverpool have a shout of being winners in the transfer market?
Do all Liverpool fans sound the same? Lol mans sound like Jamie carragher lol
agree with x on the chillwell situation, Ake is better than chillwell.
Expressions dont know auba? U will get to know him this season when we beat the shit out of you ..bring whoever u want bale regulion,  we dont care
A Liverpool fan who isn't delusional, those are rare. Cheers to him. Also Rory should allow Steven to speak, Rory's so rude at times.
Is it me or would you like to slap the fuck out of Rory?
Best signing is definitely Thiago Alcantara
Is this the kid that said Mane is the best player in the world
Gareth Bale he's one of our loans Gareth Bale he's one of our loans
Nah expressions. Willians presence brings a threat to Arsenals attack. It’s more fluid and precise to suit Aubameyang. That’s the truth. Am a United fan Timo Werner I envy that signing.
Yeah Chelsea “sat one out last year” still brought in  pulisic and kovasic last summer even tho they were “banned”
Donny van de Beek
Thiago alcantara isn’t the signing of the summer, he brings a element of creativity in the middle of the park that Liverpool have not had since coutinho left, he will be the reason Liverpool win the league again this season (unless city sign koulibally then it’s touch and go)
Expressionz not scared of William. Swear he ripped Spurs twice last year 😂😂😂
Ah Liverpool should sign a world class midfielder you say? 👀
Ben Chilwell most exciting?  Get out thiago silva is are best signing
This video comes out  Very next day, -Thiago joins Liverpool, Bale & Reguilon join Spurs-
No one is here from aftv  smh they hatin on arsenal fan tv
I’d sooner have Jamal Lewis than Chilwell never mind at 34 million less.
Easily Thiago to Liverpool
Who’s here after Liverpool signed thiago
That Chelsea kit was hideous🤣
*Michael Edwards has entered the chat*
Longer videos please
Just hand United the L and let's walk away!
This is already out of date with the Thiago to Liverpool signing
You can tell that city can only stayed watching football 6-7 years ago
I pray our(utd fans) rivals don't get owners like glazers... They are no just disgrace to club they are disgrace to football.. I feel ashamed of those shameless people.. Abt utd transfer this is worst transfer window i have ever seen by any club.. #glazersout
The Chelsea fan doesn’t ever know what he’s talking about he’s all over the place every time (I’m a Chelsea fan ) the Tottenham dude is cocky af always . Robbie from Arsenal is the best a debating usually (not there in this video today ) .
Hojberg aint a acc CDM they need a acc CDM IN THE MIDDLE
Thiago done.  Signed one of the best midfielders in the world . 20 incoming
Thiago to liverpool
The Spurs fan on some mad gear :D
Rory is such a brexit twat. So many class signings like Werner, Ziyech, Havertz and Silva, but he chooses to be pretentious and pick Chilwell
The Liverpool guy is the same lad who said "Sadio Mane is the best player in the world"
'We sat a season out' says Rory about his club who BOUGHT their history, poor lad
is that liverpool fan the “sadio mane hes the best player in the world” guy😭
And spurs are getting bale and regulaion and spurs want werghost or andre belloti where is this money coming from levy
Man said Miley Cyrus FC 😂😂😂😂
We actually played 45 mil for chilwell
Why is no one speaking about the Miley Cyrus FC, no back comment? Most underrated comment of the show.😂
Only genuine fan theres is the scouse lad.  Expressions is a child, the city fan is as plastic as they come and that chelsea helmet, he thinks the sun shines out of Chelsea's ass.  Up the Villa
If you’re gonna keep doing jump cuts just make 15 minute videos it would be beneficial for both sides
“Sadio Mane is the best in the world!!!”
I’ve only watched Werner 2wice nd that was cl against Tottenham. He didn’t look good in any of those games. And as a rival fan, I hope he flops.
Jadon sancho signing of the summer.
Chelsea, Everton, Newcastle, Arsenal 🥰
Couldn’t of done this after spurs signed bale and reguillion
WATCH My New YouTube Video Shares & Subscribe https://youtu.be/kuHTnFLOPQg
Based on werners performance against Brighton using his pace to get in behind, looks like he’s gonna cause problems for a fair few teams this year
Gareth bale is the biggest and best signing this summer PERIOD.
Get Rory out
As an Arsenal fan can't lie Chelsea have done the best transfer business this summer
Tf is Rory wearing
Lol Chelsea already have a lot of English players , we didn’t need an English quota , fact is Chelsea bought who they wanted to bring in, got every single first choice target
so many cuts
United fan here, but get that liverpool fan on more often, PROPER football fan with spot on opinions and knowledge! Likeable bloke!!
If Liverpool get Thiago this season, we saw how they crumbled vs Leeds without Fabinho, obv it was just an off game for Liverpool besides salah who played incredible but still I’ve never seen them be so dominated and i honestly believe that came from the midfield, having Fabinho Henderson and Thiago with the likes of kieta coming of the bench would not also help Liverpool controll games this season but also add creativity for mane and salah to bang in more goals. Also would like to see Curtis Jones, TAKI minamino and Brewster be given a chance
Even EXPRESSIONS can't say Doherty
chilwell overated ngl leicester fans dont rate him
WHAT IS LIVERPOOL GUY SAYING? 🤔😳 🤯
Spurs will not sign any other player this transfer window 😂😂😂 fact
Couldn't understand the Liverpool guy...da fuq was he saying!???
Imagine comparing overspending on Chilwell to overspending on Ake. YOU BOTH OVER PAID! 😂😭👍
Maguire price went up because of his form in the World Cup and plus everyone raises the price as it’s Man Utd
i like that sadio mane guy yuno he knows his shit‼️
Dub-erto Carlos
Chilwell's better than any of the full backs in Tottenham
This Spurs fan is so lame brought up Arsenal for no reason hatin ass Spurs
I quit my work thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Expressions saying he’s most jealous of donny cmon I support united but cmon 😂 it has to be Werner don’t get me wrong donny is class n will Improve anyone’s team as squad player or starting player but Werner for 50 mil bargain
Surely James Rodriguez has to be in this conversation
“Doberto Carlos” is dead
That Liverpool brudda is quality
That's a very strong Scottish accent from that Liverpool dude..
Those shorts 😂
I think Arsenal did well to keep Aubameyang so I think that would be the best in the window or getting Willian on a free, as much as it isn't the nicest thing to say
Can’t even pronounce Matt Dohertys name right ffs
Let’s just think about the lower clubs for a moment. Newcastle - great window. Brighton - pretty decent. Everton - for them, mint. None of them are going to win the league, but in terms of relative improvement, they deserve a mention.
Who ever did the editing did not like the Liverpool lad
I don’t like the toff boy Rory, he’s very arrogant
Perfect answer by Expressions : Donny Vaan De Beek
I love it when Rory represents Chelsea. I might not always agree with him but when he talks ppl listen. With Sophie she talked over no respect. Even Lewis he just sits there in a heated debate.
That Liverpool fan! Can't even understand his accent.....by the way don't look down to other clubs and don't get so hyped instead enjoy with what you've achieved. Because who know where Liverpool might end up....!
Yo where's Troopz he is funny cause he chats shit and also has respect for people at the same time.
Can’t believe they didn’t even bring up everton
X just came on here to big Arsenal Up! Getting Bale and Regullion to Tottenham would be massive still. This video should be remade on Transfer Deadline
Why is a liverpool fan even there, they haven't done any business! haha
How is this even a question
Now people will understand why Leicester are so hard to deal with.  Harry Maguire- 80Mill  Ben chill well- 50Mill
Rory not knowing that the reason city had to pay £41m for Aké was because Chelsea had a £40m buyback clause so city had to pay more than that…
Chelsea fan when people bring up how much money they have spent they bring up how much Man City have spent, they started the massive spending when they got took over by the Russian
Rory's shaven legs :')
How many of you all miss Rory and Sophie being together having the official Chelsea Fan Channel???   Anything happened between them or can we see them together. Sophie is together with DT, Troopz, Cheeky Sports while Rory with these guys. Love the channel though, the analytics and argument.
4  Glory  Hunters
Why is there a liverpool fan in this conversation even utd have had a better window
Expressions once again proved that deep down he is an Arsenal fan
I think with the signings coming up for all the teams this season, we could’ve top 4 competition for 10 teams.  Liverpool- Thiago  Man City - Koulibaly United- sancho  Chelsea - rice  Arsenal - partey, Aouar  Spurs- bale, reguilon  This are very important signings. It could take each team to the next level.
timo & hakim that link up already
Rory is a cocky delusional twat
Rory forgets to put on his trousers and shows up in his boxers.
Sadio Mane, he's the best player in the WuRlD
The signing of the Summer is Ziyech and ALL of you are sleeping on him. Its  crazy
If arsenal manage to sign partey and aouar we lowkey won the window. but who am i kidding it ain't happening
Terribly edited! Also, can the scouser come with subtitles?
Man Utd fan here. Man Utd the biggest joke in the market
Everton has been doing great signings!
Why is a Liverpool fan even in this? Made no signings and probably won't. Arsenal have made 2 good signings and tied down Auba
Utd need to get sancho. Sancho will be the biggest deal of the summer. With him our front 3 is set for another 6-7 years. And then maybe in January we get a CB because utd are shit at transfers
I think Newcastle have done amazing business, Wilson and Lewis for 35m is class business, united and Spurs wanting left back and missed a trick with Lewis he's superb, Wilson is better than Ighalo and would have been brilliant also to help Spurs with Kane's injury's .
So when his football career failed, Dan Woodburn decided to become a pundit for liverpool.
😂😂man said that timo werner reminds him of aguero when they're nothing alike
Chelsea transfer window : Silva Sarr Chilwell Havertz Ziyech Werner Mendy maybe Rice. No team comes close
The scouse lad speaks so much sense
as an arsenal fan i respect expressions so much
Does Rory only have that one Chelsea shirt.😭
Signing of the season is no doubt Turbo Timo
ManU have had the worst.
arsenal can’t afford both partey and aour
If Tottenham sign bale and reguilon. It's done.
Chillwell is shit
Rory on 888: Willian is a great signing  Rory on The Kickoff: Willian is garbage  This is clearly a man who doesn't mince his words
The Liverpool fan seems reasonable and smart, coming from an arsenal fan
“Filmed and recorded before lockdown. #staysafe”
0:17  wtf!!! who chose that colour for your name labels?
These debates have become much since no one is freaking out and talking over each other. Still could be better taking turns talking their view. Good product. Ferran Torres was best signing but Timo will have quicker impact
Chelsea playing catch-up?? They signed Pulisic in January and made the kovacic deal permanent,not to mention the loaned players coming back. That’s more signings that United make on their most desperate of windows.
Chelsea. Even as a United fan.
so weird man, Manchester fan from Manchester...
Klopp didn't pass on Werner, he was he couldn't have him. FSG are tight as fuck
Chelsea
I’ve heard it all now. Chelsea this transfer window has gotten over bigtime on every single signing this window. Not one signing did they get the raw end of the deal.   Now this Mendy deal might could be a break even but every other deal even going back to Pulisic, Chelsea has came out the winner.
Nailed it with the Willian call 🕺🏻 ...i do envy Chelsea's signings though
Signing of the summer, you could make a case for Thiago Silva. He's still one of the best CBs around and he came on a free to Chelsea and he instantly improves the defense. Thiago Silva Signing of the summer 👌
I like expressions 🔥🔥🔥
LOL NO ONE TALKS ABOUT EVERTON, PISS OF
Rory dressed for Chelsea summer camp 😀
Why’s mans wearing booty shorts?
I watch wingers destroy Chilwell every other week mans the english Aurier
Expression my man he talk simple fucking facts now arsenal we looking double deal which is partey and auorer bro love expression from arsenal fam brav we love you man the only good thg from fucking spurs
Unpopular opinion(mufc fan): if arsenal get partey or auroa (however u spell them), then I think they’ll have the best window. Chelsea’s business has been great but I feel like they are buying too many players, I get that they were banned and stuff but imo I think u have to take it in steps. Liverpool took 5 years to build their perfect until they won, city too 4 years to build their perfect team until they won and I think Chelsea will have a season w/ loads of ups and downs but I can’t see them finishing top 2 this season, but if they do fair play
Gareth Bale signing could change everything !!!
Its not even a debate. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but in my opinion even trying to compete with Chelsea's transfer window is near impossible.
Everton?
Is this even a question 😂
Dohberto carlos 🇮🇪🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chelsea fans always talking bs we all know abumayeng the best striker  in the premiership  know...cockney gooner liverpool  or chelsea won't win the league  that's right you heard it
Mike Doherty? @1:02
Arsenal fan - but Doherty is a class player , was unreal with wolves
Best signing goes to Lord Bendtner.
This is fake news around Chelsea took a year off last year. Literally signed pulisic and kovacic for a combined 120m in January 2019.
Imagine thinking German vardy is the best signing of the window🤣
Expressions we didn’t sign him purely because he’s English... we signed him because he suits Lampards philosophy and style of play? Nothing to do with the home grown quota.
Willian is best signing, for free and ready to contribute. Simple.
Nah man I can't take Rory seriously from all the exciting players they've bought man said he's most happy about chilwell. Jog on mate.
Bournemouth needed 40 million they r struggling from tv right and behind the camera
The best signing of the window so far is Aubameyang's new contract.
After Reguilon and Bale, Spurs are up there.
That liverpool fan’s only there because of his accent lol
Why is this a question
Don all day best signing of the summer
Has everyone called to Rory's house with a camera crew and he's chillaxin in his boxer shorts?
Didn’t even mention Everton?!?
Seems to of been a few cuts in this not even speaking about Newcastle's signings and a little mention of van de beek
Why is a Liverpool Fan here 😂
If Arsenal get Partey and Aouar ( to add to the list of incomings and resigning like: Aubameyang, Ceballos, Willian, Gabriel, Saliba (even though he was last season), replacement backup keeper for Emi) then you have to put Arsenal up the top with Chelsea in terms of the best transfer window because both clubs have addressed their own issues and have done their dealings.
Why is a Liverpool fan here 🤣🤣 we anit done shit 🤦‍♂️
Liverpool will not buy anyone this summer instead, they will go all out next summer and will make 3-4 good signings...
I think Werner won't be as prolific at Liverpool than he would be at Chelsea. I honestly don't understand why people write off Roberto Firmino so much. If anyone understands football, they would know what Firmino adds to the liverpool squad. He is the link up between midfield and front line for them and due to him Salah and Mane are lethal.
best signing so far is Timo Werner, I am not a Chelsea fan but I can see what class that player has and how he can help the team, he is like a fox, fooling defenders, creating chaos, very adaptable,  he can bring victory for his club out of nowhere, so pretty much scared of him, Kai is potentially good(coz Bayern considered him to replace Muller) but he needs time to adapt, we haven't seen the best of him yet, I think It will take time, how much I don't know, If we consider that money wasn't problem then it is a good signing through and through
That scouse accent man 😂😂😂
It’s not even a question
Warner ZIyech Havertz & T.Sliva
Chilwell is a fraud.
Need to fill the English quota ???? errr what.. Barkley, Mount, RLC, CHO, Tammy, James,Tomori all English lol.
Make these vids longer ! 😁
Chelsea duh
Rory laughing at City for paying 40 million on Ake is a bit rich. Doesn't he support the club that bought Danny Drinkwater for 40 million 😂
The way Expressions pronounces Doherty’s name 😂 I’m irish and trust me that’s not how it’s pronounced.
Doberto Carlos is a howler
DONNY VAN DE BEEK
Think people you need to redo this since reguilon and bale is a pretty much done deal for tottenham
coming from a chelsea fan, that liverpool fan is class. Unlike that guy that said wijnaldum is better than lampard
there is month left till window closes Rory: let discuss  how great Chelsea was at transfer window
Why is the Liverpool fan even here, they just both one youngster to play in the cup matches! It should've been someone from AFTV instead!
Of all the Chelsea signings I look forward to watching Hakim Ziyech the most. That left foot is gonna do a madness in the Prem.
The spurs fan is a clown
sancho will be the signing of the summer
obviously Chelsea have had the best window but if we’re talking value for money then i think Arsenal. Willian on a free, Gabriel for £27million, keeping Aubameyang for another 3 years and potentially signing Aouar for £45million and Partey for £50million. That would he a great window
Chelsea obviously had the best window in decades.
It’s all fun and games until Arsenal get Aouar or Partey or maybe even both
this channel needs more subscribers . come on
I’m just glad United signed Van de Beek for around 40 mil instead of flexing the money muscles and getting Grealish for 80
Scouse accent is so annoying smh
Unpopular opinion: Havertz gonna be a flop
It's not yet over. Stop blabbering
Liverpool for the fact we kept tge best team in pland added thiago to it
If Arsenal get both Aouar and Partey, and Spurs get Bale and Regulion and ManUtd get Sancho, then it will be a very interesting season.
Doberto Carlos?! 🤣 Don't even play in the same position mate. May as well have called him Donny Alves
i am watching after tottenham loss fam. i am dying
Short Answer: Chelsea Long Answer: Havertz Werner Ziyech Chilwell Silva Mendy Sarr
Out of all the signings Chelsea have made I think Werner is the one who will gel to the team and the league the fastest
Masterclass from doberto Carlos vs Everton 👏 😂 @nocontextdt_
Don’t trust Leicester fans at all. These man said that N’didi was doing a better job than Kante when he was there. So you can’t trust them
Ya get me fam, blud mans got ya get me. You do get me? Ya get me got? Good
Wait til Arteta pulls off Partey&Aouar and then chat again. Even if its just 1 of the 2 Arsenal will be a threat
Is this seriously a debate?? And to make it worse you brought a Liverpool fan
liverpool
So badly edited
Well in son footballs played on paper now. What a football brain
how is this a debate?
Tbh how are u doing this now wait until the window ends
Arsenal signing new defenders doesn't really mean much, Arsenal have been signing defenders for bare time and they still ended up shit at the back
Liverpool, kept the best team in England together, and signed the second best left back in the world as well.
why is this even a video obviously its chelsea
Everton best window easy, James, doucoure, allan for less than £60m, best transfer window and its not close
If spurs get bale and reguillon uhhh thats good
Out of all the signings chelsea get this idiot thinks Chilwell was the best. We chelsea fans don’t claim him. We’ve kept saying that
Signing of the year has to be Auba....solidify Arsenal
The north london derby: Bagel FC vs Miley Cyrus FC 😂
My personal favorite is hakim ziyech
Where’s  a Man Utd fan?? Oh wait there transfer window has only brought them a Dutch farmer
Expressionsz needs to be on True Geordie. Him & Hugh jeezzzzz game over
I can confirm as a Leicester fan, ex is right. We are laughing all the way to the bank. Chilwell one of our worst players in our starting 11 & to get £50M is funny
Spurs have had the best transfer window
Dad
Get an arsenal fan again plz
Get an arsenal fan again plz
Chelsea fans celebrating that they signed players and they forgot the goalkeeper is kepa
Everton?
Chelsea: Win. Liverpool didn’t need much. City haven’t done anything really, they need a striker. Spurs still buying.
Who else knew the answer before watching 😒
I’m glad that troopz is going man is deluded
Chelsea end of no debate they had the best window
Love this Series ♥️
