Why is i that the most guys hate shopping its so fun
WOW Julie You Look Gorgeous in this Video
I’ve got a 6 pack and whipped cream
Woooow wow wow
now show the first divorce
The genetics their kid would have been blessed with tho...
Yep, the first marriage happened in the modern age. Nailed it.
My wife says I am wrong about the white dress representing virgin purity. 🤦‍♂️
Calm an polite stone cold satire
It’s so sad knowing what will happen to them
It's funny how "started a family" exists in this universe but not marriage
Whipped Cream... check.  Six-Pack... in progress.
you missed the spot where the woman says "i will likely start a divorce but you will still have to pay for my lifestyle after i chose to leave"
And my favourite part in beginning when a guy ask, hey would you spend rest of your life with me and a woman said yeah sure yeah whatever I would like that. The guy said cool excited or anything like that like cool and my favourite part when he said, I think you should take my last name so people know that you belong  to me had me laughing
This is when   marriage and proposal was invented
wait people in the US actually do that garter thing?
Actually wearing white on your wedding day stems from Queen Victoria wearing a white gown for her wedding. Before that, people just wore their best dress, no matter the color, even black.
I actually didn’t know about the garter toss and the penis shaped thingy…..that’s fucking weird lmfaooo
wait im on the feet why is she kneelin
lol. Cute. Covered all the common practices.
Thank you for making this.
Project 2025 advocates for repealing no-fault divorce laws, forcing individuals to prove fault like adultery or abuse to end a marriage. This shift aims to promote "traditional" family structures and reduce divorce rates.  However, critics argue this would severely impact mental health, especially for those in abusive relationships. Requiring proof of fault could trap victims, as gathering evidence of abuse is often dangerous and difficult. It would also prolong legal battles, increasing trauma, costs, and the risk of further manipulation or violence from an abuser who now has a greater incentive to prevent a divorce. This approach prioritizes a rigid view of marriage over individual safety and well-being
I always thought marriage was as stupid as this infers.
dont do that
This was funny.  Hey Julie, was this based on a conversation with your real husband?   Great job!
This is how austistic couples propose
Real easy ! Barely an inconvience !
Idiot prepare divorce
Does seem to make weddings stupid
come to think about it, isnt asking someone to spend the rest of their lives with you extremely selfish?  like what right do you have to think YOUR the only person they should be with? ya know? think about it.  i mean yeah its the idea of "we are in love, i want to spend the rest of my life with you" but in all honestly isnt it a from of possession? your basically saying they cant be with ANYONE ELSE and that they MUST Be with you FOREEVER lol. marriages........i dunno maybe im overthinking it but....lol yeah. STAY WITH ME FOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER!!!!!!!!!! 🙂
Ryan: Oh, marrying Julie Nolke is TIGHT!
hilarious. i resaw this video, then the divorce video, then was like wait Julie Nolke why do i recognize that name and then saw your videos about usa being a meany pants
I’m a Julie guy, but you’re there to, so ok
barely an inconvenience
Marriage rituals are definitely stupid.
Not a double standard
2nd time seeing Julie. Back to back videos. She did great in both, so I'm definitely going to check her out. Basically, the female Ryan.
I'm so happy for the two of you.
Every word of this is absolutely RIDICULOUS.......................And TRUE!!
So u have a proposal for me  Yes mam, I do
My mom actually didn’t take my dads last name exactly because of the paperwork
The last name thing is annoying as hell.  When I get divorced, I’m just keeping his name.
Kidding aside, you two would really make a great couple.
Hello
If you didn’t make this is kind had an idea for the last name part- Man: how about you take my last sound Woman: but what if I want to keep it? Man: I don’t know, I didn’t think that far. I just thought girl take boy’s last sound Woman: but I like my last sound. Man: okay then I guess it can be a choice between the couple but I want it to be know that the girl take the boy’s last sound I decided.  It’s rizzful. The only reason I’m even watching this is because I wanted to see if you did it, and you did. It is silly but I also like my idea. I’m not going to post my idea or anything, it was just to tell you for an idea if you didn’t make this.
I love her she is a woman version of him
Everybody knows a man is taken by visiting his house and seeing that the woman completely took over.  Also, a married man loses control of his calendar, diet, and budgeting.  Married men are easy to spot because they are no longer free but are a slave.
The guy getting the ball in the background😭
“ double standard” meanwhile the entire wedding revolves around a sadistic female
You guys didn’t include Magic Mirror? Wow, wow, wow….. wow. Ps: I love you both.
Wait. They take the garter off with their teeth.
Getting married is TIGHT
2350 BC background and all lol
I hate how western media has made people think its ok to go to a strippers bar.
That's absolutely how I (an aromantic) see weddings
It’s actual shoulders and not just silhouettes 😮
It has been a WHILE since you two have done a collaboration. Would it work for you to join in one of those pitch meeting things he does?
"What was that last part you just glossed over?"  "Yeah, I'm gonna need you get ALL the way off my back about that....."
Your kids are going to be so tight. No, no, no i see it.
Finances are such a relationship killer.
This is the first time I’ve seen your channel…  Did you happen to film this on an army post, or tired college campus?
You had me till the end there.
How did I not know this existed
Lol this is how it should be 😅😅
Is he wearing a Freddy Krueger shirt?
Ties on the heads, mouth clothes removal... What kind of weddings are you going to?
RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE! RYAN GEORGE!

I like her jacket.
It is an undeniable fact in the 'most prosperous' country in the world that the number one reason for fights and divorces in a marriage are finances.
I remember my brother-in-law's bachelor party. It was lame. Just guys sitting around watching sports on TV. No strippers or anything. Then later I realized, the reason why it was so lame is because I was there. I was the brother of the bride, and therefore an enemy agent in the camp. I hope things got better after I left, but I guess I'll never know...
personally if you ask me wedding registries are so selfish.  why cant people just be happy you got married why do they have to get you gifts ya know? lol just saying lol. considering how long most marriages last these days lol i remember when my sister got married and she complained that she didnt get a lot of the stuff she wanted from her registry and im thinking well arnt you missing the point should be happy about getting married not about what gifts you got or didnt get......... seriously.  if i got married i woudnt even have a registry . honestly.
I'd tap that.
Yup. Wish I would have looked at it more objectively and realized that marriage is SO shrouded in traditions and unrealistic expectations that keep people from working at it and doing it for the right reasons.
Simp version
welcome to slavery.
Marriage is so overrated  🙄
Honestly, at age 33...I'm feeling any proposal with me will go exactly like this.😅
Julie sounded extra Canadian at the start of the video!
The funny thing is knowing that marriage is so old that neither religion nor the government were involved until something like the 12th century. People get married, it's just a thing humans do, even if getting the government and god involved were probably both mistakes.
You both ruined our busybody ideas by not getting married IRL. 😂
What about alimony and child support? and losing %50 of your stuff?
"I feel like I want to find the perfect dress. Even if it's really expensive."  "Well that's okay. If it's an expensive dress it's probably built to last, so it will be fine in the long run."  "And I'll only wear it once."
It's weird seeing Ryan interacting with anyone other than himself XD lol 😆
I’m down for marriage badges that’s a great idea
So good
Crazy how ryan kinda DID propose just then
I bet they do end up together
The guy in the background
In the midst of planning wedding...thanks for the inspiration!!  🤓
Ryan, avoid the trap! :P
Your micro expressions make your delivery super funny
Now I'm wondering if these two are actually dating.
A Ryan has breached the facility walls.
I love how she said the running gag of Ryan's "i just decided"
I watched your tax video, then this one popped up... I'm hooked
WTF
"Is there a way to force people to only give us stuff we like." Hahahah that line killed me. I Like your girlfriend. She is cool and practical
Some wild sexual chemistry there.
They have a timeline now. First moving in then this one then the baby one, then the divorce one.
The last name part! 😂 so good and so right
It sounds a little shady but I'm into it.  The Ryan George channel in a nutshell!
Shout to the dude who made the dress rule 😂
Barely an inconvenience.
I went to a bachelor party where an "adult entertainer" removed a rolled up bill from my mouth with her "anatomy." I don't know what that had to do with my buddies' marriage, but okay. Yes, they ultimately divorced...😄
Please do a first dating video!!!
If only they went with matching track suits instead of the government so many lives could have been saved
Wow wow wow         Wow
Redo the one about having a baby lol
They are both dressed like the terminator. Ryan is T1 and Julie is T2.
Don’t forget that the husband will give his wife bouquet of flowers in which she will throw it to the crowd and whoever catches it will get married next whether they like it or not.
LORD OF THE RINGS BENEDICTION CUCUMBER BATCH
Ring will control you...
You’re getting into BIBLICAL TIMES with this one……………. Lol ❤
Confused by the outside nature of the video. And somehow a non-Ryan.
Yeah totally a double standard 😑
Just found out Ryan's on his honeymoon
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marriage + Time = Divorce
I'm pretty sure her Dad will pay for the wedding. As that a good tradition to start. I just wounder if her Dad can pay for the other two parties too.
About to ask my wife if we can get badges and matching track suits. Yes I do need to ask her but make no mistake I wear the pants in the relationship... When she lets me. It would be cool if those pants were a track suit though
"thats risky" bro what the fuck
Whoa ! Ryan is really hot as a woman...  Just saying
Julie and Ryan have amazing chemistry. Looking forward to more Colabes.
Clearly they were not while together filming. Their parts were filmed separately.
Rofl. Loved thiis & the divorce video as well!
Damn you two are awesome
im glad you are helping out i swear the mustache looking women he does are not on par with you at all, except for the cow one that was kinda good
In a universe where all the boys are Ryan George’s and all the girls are Julie Nolkes
People who watched the divorce video before the marriage video 👇
Holy crow! this still one of the best things on the web :)
2:36 The Guy In The Background: Don't mind me
Could we get more colab videos between you two? Two of my favorite YouTube comedians
Btw, I have read a lot in the bible and some of these vows are almost like inviting curses and sickness to your marriage,...and where do you find such things written in the bible?  If I ever get married it will be a complete different and simple vow than the norm...because they make that vow before God...and that is something to not take lightly.
Lol...I love this.   This is so sarcastic about the whole schism of modern marriage.
LOL!! I sure wonder what the first marriage was like in 2350 B.C.
Ryan sent me! 🤗
I'm that person in the background slightly consistantly stuck in the goal net...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Canada and awesome Ryans. Name a more iconic duo.
They make bachelor and bachelorette parties sound as F’d up as the actually are.🤣
Getting married is tight
...he's got her into it now...it...it's spreading...
When he unveiled the name double standard might have been a good time to mention the fact that he’s required to provide a piece of jewelry costing 1/6 of his annual income.
“What if two people of the same gender want to do this?” “I don’t know. Maybe they’ll keep their original last names, or maybe one will want to change their last name to the other’s” “Oh, so it’s a quadruple standard. Okay.”
You missed the chance for one more party. The night before the wedding you can have all the people who are going to participate in the wedding all come to a dinner. Why a dinner? Why not.
Number one reason couples breakup is financial condition So the men doesn't earn enough 🤔🤔🤔  Seems like women is deeply into financial benefit, the way man is concerned with the looks of the woman 😅
The references they make here are exactly why I've never felt that I need a woman to change her last name to mine... She can do whatever the F she wants with HER name!
This is why learning history is important. It helps us understand how our culture, practices, and norms progressively came to be today.   Our history classes in high school aren't intended to help us understand our society through a historical lens. Instead, it literally just teaches us, in summary, Revolutionary War, mention slavery was a regretful moment in our history, civil war, World War II, Cold War, and then 9/11 - all from the perspective of White America. So much impactful history happened in between all the very few moments of our history listed above. [I argue that this curriculum is military and capitalist propaganda, but that's just my argument]   The value in effectively learning your history is that you understand your present, and the value in understanding your present is that you find clarity in your personal life and your community. You realize that the way things are today are nothing but arbitrary truths that have become the present norm through decades and centuries of human and societal development.   This world we live in is confusing. This video is all about us not understanding the point of marriage and all the practices of being engaged and married with one fully committed partner. You learn the history, you are no longer confused and you now realize marriage is totally arbitrary. Then you can finally start reimagining healthier ways of being in a relationship with someone you love.
This guy so gets you.
The nice thing about these first two videos is they were both together in the same place. The two recent videos they did were completely by green screen and they were not in the same room at the same time
I want to see the one of these where the guy is like I....really want to stick my junk in you for some weird reason! Girl: Whaaat?!?!
Can you make »The first people to ever have sex«? 🤔
This is hilarious I also recommend watching the Jim Gaffigan Weddings standup comedy skit 🤪
😁👍
I always point out that the motivations for marriage are all terrible. There's the belief that a god doesn't approve of sex without a contract binding you to your sexual partner forever, there's government social engineering (tax breaks and easier citizenship for people who adhere to the religious/cultural tradition of marriage) and then there's my favorite reason to make fun of: wanting to spend the rest of your life with someone but not believing that they'll do it unless they sign a contract that makes it a pain in the ass and a huge financial burden to leave you.
why isnt he marrying himself?
ohh, getting married is so tight!!! yes sir, it is.
imagine he asked what is romantic
Is this the guy who does the movie "pitch" sketches?
Cant believe they divorced 😭
Arguably, Ryan Nolke sounds better than Julie George
ps my sweet lill mortadella, thats my old jacket and my old shirt :)  i love seeing you in them
look my so called sister and nephew publicly making fun of me while you all pay them to, where are your cages psychos?
This video really makes you realize how ridiculous it all is... you have a shower for ppl to buy you stuff, and then your friends have to put a party together for you before the wedding to celebrate your last days of freedom, and then some ppl have stag & does to raise more money for the wedding...and then at the wedding ppl have to give you  more money as a gift.. and after all that, 50% of ppl end up divorced anyway. Its a tad vain isnt it, expecting ppl to just buy you stuff cuz youre in love. Humans are weird 😅🤣 this video made me laugh
funny af 🤣 good one guys ❤
You forgot the party AFTER the last party that isn’t a shower
Oh! F**k that, come on tell us, did ye get it on?
That was funny, but when will Ryan do a video collab with you in your style instead of his?
Just more chemistry than a can of dole pineapples
In fack, the old people (or people from old nations) used to get married for example, when man was meet some nice woman, he asked her if she want, that he can care of her, or she asked him this. If them spended plus minus 2 days together, and wanted be together further, they give hand each other, and married was officially concluded. It was pretty simple, but strong (stronger, than nowadays marriages).
Part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-pybk6XIls Part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQz2i8BjStc Part 3 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uOZA43UGPE
That sounds accurate
okay maybe being aromantic does make me oblivious, what the hell are weddings even lmaO
Are you guys actually married
Y'all too funny
That leather jacket was awesome!  (Also, I liked the sketch.)
wow wow wow wow
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bachelor/bachelorette parties are disrespectful
Also it seems like you guys would be a good couple.
I decided* not I just decided. You'll get used to it. It's easy, barely an inconvenience.
I love these colabs with Julie and Ryan ❤️
Wait... Like was this a real thing?
How can you trust someone with two firstnames
Man, what's Ryan's height? He is sitting on his knee but still comes up to her chest. LOL
They have the same eyes... It's really pretty!
Scene opens.  Stenciled on the glass door, "Julie Nolke" Guy at desk:  So, do you have a proposal for me? Ryan:  Sure do! Guy at desk:  Excellent.  Proposals are tight!  Was proposing difficult? Ryan:  Super easy, barely an inconvenience
Seems legit
"If we're just doing weird stuff I think you should slow-dance with your dad"   I'm dead.
Cute video. Thanks.
Ryan: What? Julie: What?
Any genital shaped accessories?😅🤣😅
This is genius. Well done.
We sensed the vibes back then lol
This is nearly how my dad proposed to my mom. He asked her parents' permission, and then they called her into the room thinking that he was just going to tell her "they said yes", and he was kinda accidentally pressured to propose completely unprepared, so he just said, "What are you doing for the next 50 or 60 years?" She responded "Nothing..." and thus they were engaged.😅
The two work great together
This is actually brilliant!
No seriously, I'm in on the matching track suits with badges thing.
My first time hearing “virginal” and “autumnal” is from these two lol.
This was hilarious!! Thanks Julie!! 🤗
BRILLIANT.
Matching tracksuits! Lol. I would enjoy seeing more of this. This brand new thing where two people talk to each other. Converse back and forth, one might say. A converse-a-siation (that feels a little clunky but I’ll fiddle with it and get back to you).
Marriage kinda became dumb after they started letting ho-mo's do it.
Wow. It's been more than a year since the first marriage
More please!!
Damn the editing in this is so good, it looks like they're actually in the same shot together! That's crazy.
This does actually feel like a pitch meeting
These two should get married in real life
Get married? Not a problem! Barely an inconvenience!
Sending this to my sister, she is getting married next week 😅
So……..… BASICALLY Adam and Eve………… lol
"Ooohhhh it's a double standard" it's impossible to pick my favorite moment but this moment would be on the list if I had to name at least one
👋👍
The reason why spouses don't take both names is... look at the length of some Spanish names lmao  It would get out of hand in 2 generations.
I just decided my future husband and I are getting matching badges! 😂🤣
How lucky Julie is to be mentioned in a Ryan George video.
LOL!
Financial stability is a greater factor in keeping a marriage together than love FACTs!
Oh! You guys did this before!
It's just occurring to me, for the first time ever, the very disturbing Oedipal aspect of our Western marriage rituals.
Subbing and liking was super easy! Barely an inconvenience!
Matching track suits
Very well done collab sketch! Funny execution, dialogue and break down of the more standard American wedding.  I loved this, you both gave me a wide smile!
Greatest Collab Evah!
adam and eve?
I love your channel keep up the great stuff
Ha ha . Stay for the flu. Leave for the coma.
Welcome to the Ryanverse, Julie
I'm sure this will last.
This video was great! I just wish they could've also somehow mentioned things, like monogamous marriage, gay marriage, &/or species marriage with something, like, "Maybe, we should marry my cat too, because I'm already living with him, & I really, really like him a lot like you, & I kind of want him to live with us for the rest of our lives (or maybe just the rest of his life) too. What do you think?"
Just found you through Ryan. Love your stuff!  New subscriber.
2:51 there’s a person in the back
"Yeah that doesn't make any sense" "That's not negotiable...I don't know what to tell you" ""Ok, fair enough"
i didnt know ryan had legs unti this video
Waitaminute, what was that garter part?? o.o is that a thing?!
This is like a conversation aliens would have back in their home, after a short visit to earth.
Y'know, when you put it like that, it sounds really stupid.
I thought he'd be taller. Hmmm.
Ahh Barley an inconvenience guy!!
lol. Imagine if this was accurate? Can you imagine?
this is a duo we need to see more of
ITT: Direct video quotes and comments about Ryan not playing all the parts.
“Sooo… should we go take pictures in an autumnal forest or…?”
If I wasn't already subscribed to you both, this absolutely would have convinced me. Great job you guys!
Surprised he didn't use a gender swap filter to make something like this, but still good!
Ugh. The ‘paperwork ‘! More true than you know. 🙁
That brief micro-expression he had after she said it would be fun for “everyone” just had me rolling lmao
i think im in love with her lol
The woman taking the man's name in the modern age is just a traditional choice. The reason it was necessary and not simply tradition a very long time ago is because women weren't really people they were more like property and folks needed to know what property belong to what guy. I decided.
Getting married is TIGHT.
getting married is tight!
A glitch in the matrix.
They should do more videos together
This is so nice 👍🙂👍
You two should do another video called The First Couple to Want To Be Parents.
Idk, I think Ryan Nolke sounds better than Julie George 🤔🤣
Somehow that sounds a little shady....I'm into it.  SUBSCRIBED 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like ryan with a wig
Hilarious video... it's these weird ass "traditional customs" that people expect in a wedding that makes me absolutely hate the idea of getting married... would much prefer a very low-key informal celebration personally
Why aren't his eyes really big?
Omg. This was every thought I ever had about how ridiculous wedding stuff is , played out in an epically funny skit haha
she looks like a man lol
If I were a movie producer, I would totally hire these 2 and make a romcom.
You guys should do more stuff together you got chemistry it's like you're related I don't know
Lol, presumably the same characters?
So I've made a career in audio, video, and lighting. I've done more weddings than I can count and.... this is exactly what I think every time I do a wedding. How did we get here? All these details are so weird. It doesn't make sense. But it's not gonna change, so here are some tips from 10 years and 50+ weddings experience:  Brides, stop walking down the aisle so fast, make the moment last - the person giving you away will cherish every second of that walk. Grooms, your jokes are not funny - you're getting pity laughs. Shut up, today isn't about you. Just stand there and smile. Wedding party, Don't take photos between the ceremony and the reception - your guests will hate you for making them wait. Maid of honor/Best man - don't tell embarrassing stories about how the bride/groom pooped their pants, or whatever. You're supposed to be honoring them, not yourself. You're not a public speaker, use note cards or memorize your speech. You and everyone listening will be better for it. Everyone think's they can wing it until they hear their voice over a PA. Alcohol makes receptions fun for those who drink, and miserable for those who don't.  Everyone - for the love of cake, dance! Stop being self conscious, no one cares. Have fun. Celebrate the wedding without inhibition - it's a PARTY. The best receptions are ones with full dance floors.
It's a trap
These sound like Canadians
Congratulations on your marriage and sorry to hear about your divorce.
am i the Only one who wants them to be a real life couple
So you bring up the double standard over last names, but gloss over the double standards of finances, great job!
haha love this
3:06 "if you die, I wouldn't have to hang out with your corpse" ... actually, you do, a bit :(
With Julie's future self and Ryan's producer double will make for an interesting sex life.
Perfect
HAHAHAHAHAHA.    That was GOOD!!
So awesome to see the two of you together!!!
Hey, congrats on the 1 million subscribers. Well deserved.
"Yeah I might lick whip cream off a guy with a 6 pack" "What" "What" .......
Thank you for calling out the name double standard 🤣 I didn't change mine and for some reason guys that have no stake in it (like colleagues) are personally offended and feel the need to voice their disapproval many times each which is the strangest thing
I feel it was a really shit game at first. But lots of flavor dlc has been added since.        Still a pretty shit game tho.
The first marriage is Adam and Eve
I had no idea that you two knew each other. You both deserve more than YouTube.
Do people really have the tradition of having the groom ripping the bride's panties with their mouth? where does that tradition come from? that sounds barbaric. o.o
Wow The First Couple To Get Divorced was the first Ryan George video I ever saw that was over a year ago. I never knew there was a prequel lol
"But how do they know you're mine?" Uh, he has to wear something on his finger that says he's already belongs to you so no other women can claim him.
I love how Julie adopted the classig Ryan phrase ”I decided” for this. 😂👏👏👏
Oh that was the most awkard cute moment! Loved it.
You two are like peanut butter and jelly...
"That would be a good activity"
Julie George has a nice ring to it.
haha hilarious. dude reminds me of john crist
It's interesting how you had almost exactly the same amount of subscribers when this video was uploaded.
Both videos have the same amount of views 2.69mil
“Ah so it’s a double standar- ah, okay.”
making a list of gifts is tight!!!
What about a big shower?.... Invite a bunch of people? 😂😂
the absolute governnnment!
It’s an amazing vid but I don’t like when women complain about taking the husbands last name when they have no problem with taking half his money
Nityananda!
epic how women just can't be funny.
Was getting married difficult? No it was super easy barely an inconvenience.
if real conversations could be so easy and pragmatic
She could be in pitch meeting
As a bald guy, I'm especially jealous of Rayn's hair in this viedo. It's marvelous :-D
Don't even think about getting married 🤦🤷💀🥓🥓🥓
"So, you have a proposal for me?" "Yes sir, I do."
Someone, probably: "Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover event in history" Julie and Ryan: "Hold our government papers"
These are both awesome and I would love if you guys did more of these.
1:14, virginal, so shouldn’t that be red then?
Ryan getting married with someone other than himself is TIGHT !
Wow, just like Dr Who, there's a female Ryan George - excellent collab' sorry I'm late to the party :D
I went to a friend's bachelor party once and just out of nowhere someone decided that we should hire a stripper. So they called around at like 10pm trying to find someone. They wanted two women but only one could come right away then the other would show up later and do her thing. I wasn't super into the idea at all but I was overruled. I stayed out of curiosity and it was even more depressing than I could've ever imagined. After the first woman nobody wanted to go through that again but it was already paid for. The second one was even worse. It was such a bummer that I just left at one point and went home.
Two of my most favourite sketch creators on the Youtube getting together and making videos. You love to see it.
thank you for existing....I so fukin' need to laugh right now...thank you
I wish we would have implemented the matching track suit tradition.
This is a good reality check.
You guys match beautifully in comedy
You are PB & J
Maybe people should have done the matching track suit thing…
This is gold! True comedy compatibility

🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 here is a trophy for me and nooot yo
Pfft... and they say spider man movie will be when for the first time universe will collide?!
Sex with only you is marraige
Hyphenated Last Names are a thing
What an insufferable woman. No wonder she's single
I thought he looked like Ryan Gosling a little. Then I saw "ft. Ryan G" and I got really excited. Then I was like "huh I guess there are just a lot of hot Canadians named Ryan".
True innovators, this couple. Though from 1:25 Ryan's clearly thinking he made a mistake.
Super difficult, very inconvenient.
Here to see the bonkers logic behind marriage explained.
Ryan's words are coming outta that lady's mouth.
a girl making videos with Ryan is TIGHT
After seeing what Julie orders online, white is definitely a push :p
Well, that's at least a logical and sensible explanation on the kneeling. I mean, Russia got the whole last name thing right in regards to equality and the idea of non-ownership. It's certainly *confusing* but they got it right.
in the background... 2:35
spending time with your corpse is tight! Subscribed cause of Ryan. Let's see what Julie is all about ;)
Is this part of the Ryan-verse?
It's sad the marriage didn't work out. I was kind of blindsided.
How were they born
First man to ever sign a contract with someone that gets rewarded for breaking it.
Analytics.
why isn't it matching tracksuits
Wow!. just watched this and the divorce one. its on the same day!. that was a damn short marriage.
This really drives home how dumb a lot of wedding stuff is lol.
You forgot about the vacation after party number 3. You leave all your friends & family to clean up while you lay on a beach somewhere & wonder if you've done the right thing.
This is the exact meaning of passive aggressive
This sketch is how I discovered Julie, and it is one of the most glorious things I have ever seen ❤
Is Ryan really tall or Julie really short?
next: the first person to die
woah what a cross over! EDIT: Holy crap, I never realized how similar your senses of humor were! please do more skits together!!!!!
Ryans women costume is really good, cant even tell its him
how was this a year ago already…
You have to take his name since you get half his stuff later when you "unmarry."
Hi 👋!!!!!
lucky guy gets to marry blonde Julie
She comes off as a discount Jennifer Aniston
Wow, you two are amazing together. The comedic timing is beautiful.
Two of my favourite YouTube people do a collaboration and YT decides to wait a year to tell me. WTF YouTube? 🤬
my stupid head thinking it was a collab with his gf 🤦‍♀️
can you guys please get married in real life and can I come to the wedding?? lol
I really hope they datinf lol
The beginning is nothing like the middle  or end. The beginning is supposed to be triggering. Keep in mind that whoever these people were before you is still  who they are since you.
Was I the only one waiting for the "Barely an inconvenience? line?
Probably should have watched this one first
I thought for sure that he was gonna say “super easy, barely an inconvenience” at some point
This bleeds Canadian.
It was super easy, barely an inconvenience...
You’ve done first couple to get married, and then first couple to get divorced.  Would you do a video of first couple to have sex?, but with no animals to get the idea how to do it.
Can you do the first couple to hire a divorce lawyer?
Julie: "If you die... is not like I have to hang out with your cops..." Ryan: "I wouldn't do that, no..." Julie: "Yah, 'cause I may get weird looks..."  Juana la Loca: >_>
I discovered Julie a little under a year ago so missed this then.. and I discovered Ryan only last month.. and now I discover these two videos and it's pretty fantastic to see you both together doing stuff. :3
"Ooooh, so it's a double standard. Ok, yeah, that's fine."  LMAO!
1:00  " i just decided " is Ryan's line !
I really would have loved to have seen the two of you playing every guest on your wedding day…
Lol
Niiiiiccceely done lol
Hysterical!
aww you got a girl friend <3
youtube crossover event
julie channel description, "i am an actor writer comedian..."   Ryans' channel description"WAtcH rYaN!"
"But I'd probably stay for the flu, and maybe leave for the coma"  Ouch
"Just where he's talking to himself" lol
This is brilliant. Marriage is such a silly concept!
There are non-Ryans in the Ryan Cinematic Universe?!😱
"he makes super funny videos, just where he's talking to himself" WAIT! those aren't his twins???
RYANS HERE TOOOOOOO WAWEEEEE
Lmao! This was so well done. I wish you two would collaborate more often.
getting Married is super easy, barely an Inconvenience!
I feel like this isn't his cleanest work. Sorry dislike.
I found my way into a documentary, I did.
Ryan's videos lewd me here. Great skit! Too bad you're already spoken for.
"won't it be difficult to find a female Ryan?"  "Super easy! Barely an inconvenience!"
I frigging love how he stays with Pitch Meeting format of shooting over the shoulder catching the back of the head.
So, is her name now Julie George?
Ryans light blue eyes looks amazing with outside lighning
I came here from Ryan George which I got to from  here and now I'm on a Dormammu loop I can't get out of.
Julie George, has a nice ring to it.
Waw Waw Waw, Waw.... Waw!
Seems like the cloning machine turn the gender into a female huh.
I thought the first couple who got marry are supposed to seal the alliance of two ancient tribes, or royal clans or something
This was fun 😂
Julie George sounds fire though ngl
Ryan has LEGS?!
Funny thing is, that I watched the divorce one first.   Now it all makes sense.  :-)
You forgot the Prenup conversation.  Would have been classic.  She, when I leave I get half your stuff.  Him is there a way I can prevent that.   Should have added a Prenup conversation.
Then Ryan did a backflip snap julies neck and save the day
That's tight!
Sounds like Shamy planning their wedding
do people do the garter thing? that's... nope (also like in the middle ages people (or before) used to get married by getting together the whole village then jumping over a broomstick or actually just like agreeing to be married and then they're married and then priests were like no we're not having people just getting married whenever they want we're gonna make it so a priest has to say people are married not the people who are getting married) (also in medieval times practically no-one believed in witches, women were encouraged to masturbate because it was thought to be healthy to get release regularly also other women could do that together that was fine but a woman was burned at the stake for (consensually) using a strap on with another woman because lesbian sex fine subverting gender roles you die)
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
Excellent 😂
I'm married 30 long years. It's been a great ride... But one thing: how do you kick the adult kids out of the house, after they come HOME from college?
You guys actually make a really cute couple!!
Great!
Came from Ryan George's Video, FUNNY STUFF!! XD
I wonder if Ryan and Julie would do another mini-series like this, maybe the First Couple to Exist/Go on a Date, or a fun one where they could talk to themselves like usual could be the First Couple to Go On A Double Date
Now I know for sure: I'll never ever have a traditional wedding.
The finance part is so true! I remember say about 10 years ago it was socially wrong to say  that money matters but today it’s more widely accepted that finance can affect the r/s! Or at least in my age group 😌 felt like a bitch then because I dared say I need my future partner’s job to be good/stable.
Well it’s not negotiable I don’t know what to tell you
Please please please do one titled "The first couple to throw a Gender Reveal Party" ! 😀
So they have no parents and stuff?
Ryan George as Reed Richards. Julie Nolke as Susan Storm. I literally typed, edited, and read a paragraph that led to bad grammar and spelling, and rewrote this for my point, they cute, so... Make it happen Marvel. Ryan Richards, and Julie Storm.
Of course he marries her. She's one of the only people in that universe who doesn't have the same face as everyone else. Who wouldn't.
She looks like J-Lo here
First time seeing them talking to another human being other than themselves
For a couple of years now one of the funniest imaginary events that I've come up with is 'The First Man To Ever Drink Cow Milk'. :D Maybe it was two men... and maybe they work totally drunk of that much rotten grapes they ate a few hours earlier... and imagine that dumb and smiling expression how one of them started pointing at one of the peacefully standing cow on the field, and how they start chuckling while they closing on the hintless cow... :D
How this women 2:35 in the background is not Ryan or Julie and these 3:54 people at the background
Julie George lol 😂
Ryan has been Adam for a while, now an Eve has appeared
Right , got halfway, that thing there, all of it,  its not happening.
This WAS GREAT!
So does this take place in the Ryanverse or the Julieverse?
The white is so you can say you are rich 🤑
Me who came from the first couple to get divorced: Ah yes if there's dawn there's dusk
The soft sausage immuhistochemically decorate because brochure dolly cross afore a omniscient commission. dangerous, guiltless balinese
This Marriage will be Super easy, barely an Inconvenience
Is that garter part a real thing? I've never heard of it.
Is that Rhian Georgia?
Sounds kinda feminist….
The somber pest uniformly communicate because medicine cytogenetically list between a bent bowl. nostalgic, quick venezuelan
This needed a lot more time... Lol lol 😆
Ummm...  I had no idea that Ryan had a pair of legs!
God damn this type of humor is over done.
Matching tracksuits!!!!!
Brilliant
Brilliant! Well done.
Hilarious!
The "for the richer or poorer" was the best part😂😂
it's the prequel to hit video the first couple to ever get divorced.
Crazy that most of use adopted this without reading a manual.  Was there ever a Manual...? O_o
"he makes funny videos JUST LIKE EHERE HE'S TALKING TO HIMSELF"??? Excuse me Miss, he doesn't talk to himself. He has a whole universe with many different people.
Marriage: It's "Super easy.  Barely an inconvenience."  (Somehow my pants suddenly exploded into flames.)
Wow wow wow wow, people getting married is tight.
They do look like they would make a good couple....
You two are so perfect together, like peanutbutter jelly perfect together. The chemistry and timing is on point.  WowWowWowWowWowWow
You guys make way too much comedic sense together 😅
The two of you play well together
Wow, Ryan’s really good at hiding his accent, it rarely pops out just on certain words, but the lady. Whoa boy.
"Oh, well, that's not entirely accurate but I'm into it" 🤣  Well if we are just doing weird stuff I think you should slow dance with your dad 😂😂
This should be how all adults talk like.  P. S. I would totally shower with my girlfriend together (it's more fun, we  save water and we can help with each  other backs)
It made sense back when the tradition started
“Ohhhhhh it’s a double standard.”
Wow wow wow…. Wow.
Is that a shovel head jacket?
Hi I came over from the divorce video you did with Ryan cause Im a bit emotionally numb which seems to have zero'd out my inhabitation. Ya see I actually clicked on the initial video because I thought I'd seen you from somewhere but turns out I was wrong. But you are very funny and very pretty and without trying to signify those as being the only traits that validate you as a person I hope your doing ok and have a nice day.
I hear you make videos where you talk to yourself... so here I am...
"How do they know your mine?" "Oh there's no need for that"
You guys covered everything nice
😂
I just realized they have what they call "parents" even though they're supposedly the first people to get married
Oh, so this is how the tradition started. LOL
I ship Ryan and Julie 💓💓. Can you guys be a couple in real life?
Ryan's brand of manner in speaking only works when he does it alone talking to himself. It's not as funny with another person. Am I alone in this thought?
haha, ok this was the first video I watched that was funny and well done...
Should we start calling her Julie Gorge? Nevermind, they broke up.
So I am not the only one who thinks that the garter thing is weird.
THAT'S why you don't see her dress until the day.  Ooooohhhh ...
So is this like a platonic marriage?
Came here from Ryan's channel. You're great too. I'll watch other videos. Greetings from Brazil!!!
I knew it. I’ve been monitoring the amount of subscribers that they both have, ever since they did the 2 callabos , and hers haven’t been increasing faster than his. Not even close. I guess it’s not just me that thinks he’s much funnier than she is.  Either that or guys just like this kind of humor more than women? No, she’s boring as f*ck!
Is this true? Do you guys have lists? I would be so ashamed to hand a list out.
The first marriage in all of history was perfect and beautiful and it was between one man and one woman, Adam and Eve and God married them together, He married the first husband and wife ever ❤ Genesis 2:18-25 And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.” Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said:  “This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.” Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
🤎
Now I know how Canadians sound like, this is the first time I actually hear the accent... Lol.. I'm South African...
"... and we all pretend its not an uncomfortable situation..." ahahahahahahahahahahahahha holy cra* this made me nearly p** myself because of laughing. i never get that "lets get a naked woman"-stuff
Pretty sure Lily Tomlin did this bit 40 years ago.
You guys bounce well off each other. Great skit.
I definitely see a divorce coming in their future...
3:12😄
How does she not have millions of subs?!? I see these stupid basicly home videos with kids running around screaming and those channels have millions of subs! This lady deserves so many!!!!
"Oh, oh, it's a double standard, oh I get it" 😂
I wish all weddings were THIS super-easy-barely-an-inconvenience...
It’s weird to watch him without a green screen background
Those kids playing soccer in the back are probably wondering what the hell you guys are talking about😂😂
Green screen is better
Great comedic timing by both of you. And yeah, watching the other one is also highly recommended. This matching track suit idea appeals to me.
I’m not compatible... at all, very old school, like extremely. I’d just piss any modern woman off guaranteed. Like non negotiable. I can’t stress enough just how dated my thought process is to where I’m only 24 and all my morales are already “wrong” and “man spreading” and “hateful” even though they aren’t racist, sexist, or even immoral there just not considered okay opinions any more and I refuse to shake them so I don’t know what to tell you.
4:05 Yikes! I think I discovered the _real_ Julie, Actor Julie, the one who has never appeared in any of her comedy sketches as far as I can tell. If I close my eyes I hear Malinda. The voice is not identical but the delivery is spot on.
Here from Ryan’s channel but you are pretty funny to! Keep it up!
So that's how this all got started... Question is WHO TRAVELED BACK IN TIME and told everyone else ?  ....and why
Imagine the people watching this from the distance must be so confused
White is actually something queen victoria invented before it was red.
When he asked "how will this go with the kids?"  I was convinced she'd say "It'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience ".   You let me down lady! 😥
You two need to do more together, I decided.
How did you get the actual footage
Yeah....none of that sounds like fun. Definitely not getting married lmao. I want love and a partner but marriage just sounds like a bad deal.
This is great!
Is it bad I ship you guys soooooo much lol
I got 3 minutes in and relized this wasnt on ryans channal
I knew there was something familiar about Julie's style but i couldn't quite place it until now!
Do you guys have to do this all in us, can anyone tell me if it's true
😆😆😆
Bippity-boppity-boo videos as good as you
I really liked the chemistry between you 2 was entertaining I would love to see more collaborations. Very funny🙂🙂🙂
Both their timing is way of when they talk to real people xD
I love you both 🥰 !!!
I liked it big time.😃
“I think you should take my last name so that everyone knows you are mine” “But then how will everyone know that you are mine?” “Oh there is no need for that” “Okay, double standards, got it.”   Damn. Best part!
Proposals are tight.
Oh nice. This is not Ryan's channel. But nice.
Hillarious
It feels weird saying it as a white guy, and maybe it's the lighting and cameras, but y'all both have startlingly blue eyes and pronounced eyebrows and it's really distracting.
Really great acting from the both of you 😮👏
Ryan really slayed that makeup.
Savage
Lol u did a colab with Ryan george  Edit: lol it literally said that at the end and I posted this comment in the middle of the vid
Best crossover event in YouTube history.
Are you guys actually married
Always thought the concept of a bridal registry was awful.  "Hey, get us this!"
I'm just swept up in the moment!
I'm not seeing a lot of chemistry here, they might have to divorce
lol funny video - its funny she is directing everything for her self So true even in 2021 and when you break it off
The autumnal forest 🤣 so good
Did anyone see that guy in the background
Silly Julie. Ryan isn't talking to himself. He's talking to one of his hundreds of clones. 😁
I watched the divorce first, this is a trip. LOL
Just sub & liked,,love Screen Rant 🧡🤘❤👍💛💙💜💚....
The divorce video got me introduced to this channel, so thanks for the cooperation :)
are u and the "pitch meetings" guy married in real life? (itd be epic if u r)
Ryan wears Vessi!!!
kinda disappointed that Ryan George isn't asking himself to marry him
You don't need a marriage license to love someone, also a marriage license won't help you keep the other one loves you.
Yeah . Blame these two😅
Both videos point out a double standard
Why are you guys so far apart? lol
You guys should do the  first couple to ever get married, but spanish speaking countries version. You might find it surprising.
OMG the name change convo spoke to my SOUL!!!!!
Can you guys please deconstruct everything in my life, so I can just check out completely?
Matching tracksuits 👌
The colors on the camera are off.
“I might lick whipped cream off a guy with a 6-pack”  “What?”  “What?”   😂😂
2021: 1423
To be fair, and maybe I'm wrong, I always thought the last name thing used to be about kids. Cause, I mean, there's no need for a woman to claim her children. Everyone in her life knows for a fact that those children came out of her body, so... she's kinda stuck with them. But in order for a man to say "Hey yeah, those are my kids" and make it official, he gives them his last name, and the woman takes the last name, too, to basically say, "Yeah, I'd be cool with this guy taking the father role for all of my future kids whether they're really his kids or not. Please and thank you."  But now with science (paternity tests) and the fact that marriage isn't really about kids anymore, we've kinda moved past this old custom.
Your videos are always great
I'm losing my mind
I don't know why I thought you 2 knew each other but it just felt like you guys did
Julie: What if we want to separate, is that going to be hard Ryan: No, its going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This was literally me when I got engaged. Clueless... 😂 All of it doesn't make sense. 🤦🏾
Man must have been hard to be the first couple being married.   "actually its super easy, BARELY AN INCONVENIENCE"
i love how they both made these on the same day
I just can’t get enough of these two !   😊😊😊
The most casual marriage ever
Not seeing the bride's dress thing is actually very possible
Honestly the illness conversation is already a lot more than what some people discuss before getting hitched 😳🙃
sadly I know too much bout history to enjoy this because I know the first couple to get married was a guy buying the woman from her father (and i wish to god i was kidding)
I got down on my knee .. barely an inconvenience..
2:35 I just noticed that guy in the back taking down the goal net.
Double standards are tight! 🤣🤣🤣
There is so much truth in this, very nice!
So smart 👌🏻
I'm not ready to see Ryan interact with other people . Made me feel weird
I never knew Ryan had legs
Brilliant!
Julie is sooooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Julie George
We could make a list.  "Oh, I'm list-ening."  I see... well, hear... what you did there.  :D
Priest: "That second party is also about religion now, God decided."
Wow wow wow,... Wow
Did I just find another great channel?
"Inviting a bunch of people to a big shower is tight !"
funny how Ryan pins Julie's comment on his channel and Julie also pins Julie's comment on her channel
If you enjoyed this sketch, please Like and Subscribe! 🥓🤠🤸‍♀️🏆🙆‍♀️
Well, for me getting married was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Hmmmm how did Ryan go transformation jutsu
And that is why marriage as it is only brings problems but doesnt solve any.
0:10 roll credits
Should have worked in super easy barely an inconvenience
My god Darcy is such a good actor. If you look closely you will see he is playing the ring!!!
"Badges? Matching tracksuits?" :-D
So weird women don’t wear normal socks when it’s cold out
I don't like this video. He didn't said - "Wow wow wow   wow       wow"
Sceen Rant fans: Well they can't be getting married, Ryan's OURS!
"We could make a LIST",..."Ohhhh,  I'm LISTening".   Effin brilliant!
Loved seeing you two do a collaborative video!
You should have added the best part, the part where the guys goes to family court and gets divorce raped. Should have described the legal implications of a marriage contract and the bias predatory system of lawyers and judges that live off this corrupt system. Then you could see the guy making skid marks as he peels off. Marriage is crazy!
Why did I never realized Ryan was in Canada😭😭😭
0:23 😍
Well for me last name thing isn’t a double standard when I get married if she has a cooler last name I’m taking dat last name
is this Ryanverse cannon or is it a standalone thing?
Sees Ryan in front of NOT a green screen:  Wait, that’s illegal.
“So how do they know your mine?” “They don’t need to” “Oooohhh okay yeah Its a double standard okay”  The way she can capture Ryan’s attitude PERFECTLY
Are these two married in real-life? They are brilliant.
Do you believe in God? And are you saved? If so go tell someone else and tell them to tell someone else if not then go read the Bible take Jesus as your saver. If you don't want to then well you don't have to.......
Your whole life ?!  That's awfully long...
HOL UP RIGHT THERE JUST A MINUTE. I WOULD RECOGNISE THIS GODDAMN PARK ANYWHERE. THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD PARK. ST-SIMON APÔTRE WITH JONH CABOTO SCHOOL BEHIND THEM. WE USED TO RUN BEHIND THAT SKETCHY FENCE AND GET HURT BY THE RADOM BUSHES. What are you doing there ... mhhhh im becoming suspicious. I think this guy might actually exist outside of this little thin "box" that moves and talk... a "phone"I reckon they call it
1:08
White people humor is 😆 hilarious..... no offense.... hug fan
So strange seeing him talking to another person
-how do they know you're mine? -ma'am I want you to get aaaalllll the way off my back about that.
Marriage is tight!  oh really?
Marriage proposals are Tight!
If a girl I wanna marry has a cool last name I'm taking it for myself. Like Sparrow or some shit, way cooler than my name.
F'n brilliant, this and Part 2. Well done.
Did she say Ryan George talks to himself? What on Earth is she talking about???? Those are all different people.. right?
So are all the women in the Ryan George universe the same?
Omg....you put it that way....IT IS TOTALLY RIDUCULOUS!  LOL
Hi Julie! I love your channel, but there was one line that bothered me. Queen Victoria wore white to her wedding, so it became a trend that has stuck for a long time. Of course, this was just silly, but yeah. It was a great video.
This was strangely accurate
Wish every marriage was that well
"So that's not entirely accurate" - what a great line ... and implication
I loved this.
"for richer or poorer" 3:38
the first people to have a signifigant other
Thick accents going on
Is this what people do when they get married? That does sound super weird.
My dad Actually Took my moms Garter off with his mouth at there wedding......
Wouldn't they know he's her's the same way...she took his last name so they share a last name...strangers wouldn't know she was his or who's last name it was first...and people you know...already know...😉. That's not the reason women take men's last name anyway.
are they real dating
before i clicked on this video i was thinkg, i know that the reason the person keels is going to be because they were tieing their shoe and i was right.
Does the fact that this video has 9,000 less views than the First Divorce video have any social significance?
You two belong together lol
Now this is good content
*Yup. That basically covers how insane the concept of a “legal/government issued” marriage is....* Why not just have the party, if you feel like pissing away $10,000+ on a super stressful event that you (and those nearest & dearest to you) won’t actually enjoy and/or remember?! 🤷‍♀️
LOVE
This could also be known as "the Wedding pitch meeting"!
I'm on the spectrum and I genuinely wish this is how relationships worked. 😂 Just.. be clear. Decide on things. Probably kills the mood though.
American mentality. You can hear the privilege
This way funnier than I expected !! 😂😉
In my country we don't take our husband's last name, so I never even imagined the paperwork women have to do after. Sounds exhausting tbh
Must be tough being both the only woman and the only non-Ryan George shaped human in the Ryanverse
This channel is awesome!
It's not a double standard. You share the same last name 😂
Jesus loves you so much ❤️ I was addicted to porn, I was on drugs, alcohol, I hated people, he set me free and he can set you free aswell ❤️ all you have to do is repent and trust in him and he will change your life! ❤️
“Ohhhh its a double standard, yeah that’s fine” 😂😂😂
Do a married with children pitch meeting
Loved this.
2:35 "you are an outsider to this world..."   The guy in the background
Julie George
Adam and eve
Well, you just convinced me to never get married.
Ain't that the truth
Is it weird to see both of you not talking to yourselves?
Watched your Pandemic time travel videos and thought "This kind of reminds me of Ryan George" and then the algorithm sends me this video  Not that I think you're derivative - you're really funny as well, it's just that the format was familiar
This really could be one of the most ambitious and epic crossovers of all time.
Nice 😎
I love how this and the divorce video came out at the same day
I think the slow dance thing with Dad and Mom is weird, too.
You know with all this gifting and party thing happening, you could move away and in about a year or so of re friending do it again.  It could all be scripted and packaged.
I really hope these two hook up. Lol. They would make the funniest babies!
asking people what to gift you just because its your wedding is the most american thing ive seen.
2:45 i was with it up until the 👿GOVERNMENT💢 hihihi
The first couple to ever get married was something like this: Dad1: Let's merge assets. Dad2: Let's merge assets. Dad1: How are we going to draw the contract? Dad2: Our kids will spend their lives together and produce an heir to both our assets Dad1: Great plan. Dad1 and Dad2: Come on kids you are going to make babies even though you barely know each other if at all and might even hate each other, it doesn't matter, wealth and assets ftw.
1:30 that's how this tradition probably started😂
YT algorithm threw this up 5 months later and I can’t complain.   Also, Ryan George...if you wanna propose to me, I won’t complain.
JULIE, Do you know why guys kneel to propose? Because they are asking her Koochie.  !
This seemed like it was barely an inconvenience.
At my wedding ill just ask for money for my gifts
relationship is very easy barely an inconvenience.
"Is getting married going to be hard?" "Actually its gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience."
I really don't understand how this was supposed to be funny. I'm not even trying to be mean. It just doesn't land.
2:35  Who is that random person in the background
aaah, now that all makes sense! 🤣
Great Video This video introduced me to Julie and I loving her too Keep up the good work 👍👍👍
This is so weird seeing a 3 dimensional version of Ryan movie around
you look like tori black...compliments
Genious script
Płot twist this is just two ryans
yes pls yes pictures of ryan and julie in the autumnal forest
didn't know ryan george had legs
2:54 It is not a double standard. Sharing his last name with his family is meant to make the man feel part of the family as well, the woman and the kids being already sharing a natural, intimate bond printed in the flesh.
You make a good team. Very dry humor, which I can appreciate. There was defiantly laughter coming from one of my personalities, I think it was Ted.
Getting married? Super easy! Barely an inconvinience!
FINALLY FOUND THIS...IT RECOMMENDED ME
We're all Ryan here.
Wait wait wait... So you got married, had kids, grew apart and fostered enough bad feelings for a divorse. IN ONE DAY? That's a new academy record :D  Edit: Also... is the Demon Spawn (tm) from this marriage?
First person to get a job.😂
He likes teriyaki
Hemm your name will be Julie George, I say do it!!
I wanna know more about the person setting up the goal net
I like how it descends from a series of party ideas into a lot of challenges to do wierd stuff.
HE HAS SO MUCH BODY MOVEMENT GAHHHH
Damnit, I watched the divorce one first.
Kiss, you guys 😂
Ryan: Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Julie: Why? Ryan: Well for one thing you’re like the only woman in the world without facial hair  Julie: Right That makes sense
0:00  “Will you spend the rest of your life with me?” “Sure.” “Cool.”  *video ends*
What is this, a crossover episode? 🤣
https://youtu.be/BQz2i8BjStc
Matching tracksuit YES!
This is really funny! Both videos.
Fantastic!!
that was hilarious! beautifully well done! but im curious now, why was ryan's head inserted in post when you cut to the wide shot?
😂😂😂
So the only competition Julie has is Jazmine from Aladdin and several Ryans to choose from in the Ryanverse lol good for her
"Are you just saying that so you don'y have to go shopping with me?" had me in tears of laughter!
They should do The Pitch meetings together 😂, it would be double the fun
Julie George
So it's a double standard?  Oh - okay, fine.  YES!
If you have Ryan George in a video with one other person, does it make it that you are filming a crowd?
So funny
yeah ryan by him self is funny and cool you just overacting you seem like you trying to act just like him
lmao gurl
Wow, Ryan is getting really good, now he can play a woman too.
I love that the first engagement ring was her own ring that she hadn't even noticed she'd lost. There's a hidden message in here somewhere, I know it.
Been watching you both, but had only just realized that I wasn't subscribed to either. Fixed. Woops. Now only thing left is for you both to make a collab with Honest Government Ads channel:D
I’ve never had a wedding and only experienced one or two as a young child and man did I just learn a lot 😳
The first video where ryan wasn’t talking to himself
Yah, When You put it that way 😂
My husband took my last name...it was sweet not to do all the paperwork!!!
With the same last name, you share a last name together, it can go ether way, so it does not really matter XD
Hmm too bad they missed the most important part. Going nearly bankrupt on the Wedding, paying more than a couple would on a house down payment and possibly being in debt for first 3-5 years of their marriage due to the wedding.
Next video: the first person to get pregnant
Why isn't it Ryan in drag
"We could make a list."  "Oh, I'm *list-ening."* 0:52
Then she did a back flip, snapped the bad guy's neck, and saved the wedding day!
The outro music made me rewatch knives out
When all values are dropped marriage is indeed comical and unnecessary.
Ah so THAT'S why they call it a shower!
I know this isn't a good video to post this, but could y'all give our channel a watch? My brothers and I mess around, and make some short films/sketches. We'd love some feedback on them.  Thanks for your time.
You both look like siblings
"Rather than quoting something from the video that everyone just watched and heard anyway, I'll just quote myself saying nothing related to the video".
this must have been really hard to film...  "actually it was super easy, barely an inconvenience"
Makes me think of Sandra Bullock ;)
oh! instant subscribe
This has to be the most slept on line in this video xD  Ryan: "Oh by the way, at this bigger party, I'd like all the men to wear ties around their heads when things really let loose" Julie: "Yeah.. well that doesn't make any sense.." Ryan: "It's non-negotiable, I don't know what to tell you"
Name changes are Tight! This was easy to watch, barely an inconvenience.
Well, I'm from Algeria and I'm 29 years old, 1.70cm, and I have never had a woman in my life, I know that it's hard to believe, but this is the truth, I hope I can find the right one soon.
wait, how is he so calm?
The first couple to ever get divorced came up in my recommended first, 2 days later this one comes up lmaoo I love them both thoo
who just realized this isn't Ryan channel
hey if ever you guys make a wedding video, can you please cast the writer guy as a best man and the drunk reflection as the maid of honor?
Now that I think about it... it wasn’t the girl n the boy who decided... it’s the parents who traded/sold/forced their kids n were like ok I will u something in return (for girl... u can have girls party, gifts, dress and for guy... u can have any paid woman before ur forced marriage to a woman n can do shitty things along the way)
This is stupid.
This one failed.
Nice job.... I love the way you and Ryan bring out how absurd so much of what we do is....
Ryan is getting very good at acting.
NOOOOOO! Where was Super Easy, Barley an inconvenience?
❤️❤️👩🏼👨🏻‍🦱
The fact that it’s not Ryan George in a wig is a crime against humanity
This is what l go on YouTube for
Hey get married, be an excellent couple
“It’s non-negotiable I don’t know what to tell you.”
😂👌
Did I miss the kissing part?
Getting married is super tight!
they are now officiallly engaged
“- Well, we can make a list. - Oh, I’m LISTening.” That one got me 😂😂
LOL 😂
U 2 should get divorced...
Weddings are so petty 😂💀
Julie: *Demands 3 parties* Ryan: That's a lot of parties  Indians watching: 3 is A LOT?? WE HAVE 14. The whole thing takes 6 months.
Q
This was super easy. Barely an inconvenience
Tik Tok, "He is one more knee away from begging."  🤣
You forgot to invite holy men but only from one sect of one religion
School playground
RYAN GEORGE IN 4K, OH MY GOD
I am very confused.. why doesn't she look the same like him?
No perfect crossover exis........
The first person to exist in the Ryan-Universe that isn't Ryan. Impressive.
Lol this is great
THE ULTIMATE CROSSOVER
Julie George or Ryan Nolke?
Me coming in here thinking I'm about watch a video on Adam and Eve
This is not politically correct. You’re banned from Twitter!
I didn't realize Ryan in a different comedy style would take a lot of getting used to.
Do you want to spend your life with me? Yeah, I guess, ok.  We can get only what we want by making a list.  I’m *totally* into that.
They'll know because she has his last name
Hmm this wedding sounds super easy barely an inconvenience.....Syke sounds awful
Marriage: Stay for the flu. Leave for the coma.
The veil is what is the sign of virginity, the white dress is a newer tradition thanks to Queen Victoria wanting to show her people that she was thrifty. Deep colors like royal blue, Burgundy, emerald, deep purple were all popular wedding dress colors because it showed how rich the couple was since dyes were really expensive.
I thought I was on ryans channel until the end lol
Great job!
Awesome 😂
New to your channel because of this collab with Ryan George. I’m basically in heaven because of all your videos I can now binge hahah
None of your comedy has ever made me laugh. Please stop making content thank you.
getting married is TIGHT
That was hilarious. Love it 😍
Weeeeeeaaaaaak. Hundreds of years just for millennial humor.
Liike, pretending marriage only started 40 years ago only in the US xD
Oh hey it's Bearded Julie
Well, that marriage didn't last long.
Mocking stereotypes are tight 👀
lmao and the divorce vid and this goes amazingly
When you love someone so much you wanna get the government involved
Wtf? How did the heck did ryan find her, she's perfect.
Thanks Julie. I love your videos. 👍👍👍😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣
"Ryan: - I think you should definitely take my last name. That way everybody knows you´re mine Julie : But how do they know your´re mine. Ryan: -Oh there´s no need for that. Julie: -Oh it's a double standard, I get it." I see what you did there.  :P
Getting married sounds tight and its super hard barely a convenience
I never seen Ryan George that beautiful how did you transformed in that man?
Autumnal forest...lol
Lol
Seeing Ryan with someone else feels WHOLESOME. Ryan has friends! :P
I'd like it if it was Ryan and Ryan.
2:34 more than two people in the Ryan verse confirmed.
Super entertaining! Here from Peter's channel
You r not funny really you not
In Netherlands it's pretty normal to make a list of the gifts you want. They don't always have to stick to it, but fifty percent of your gifts were probably on your list. And it's not considered rude. It is polite, because this way you guests won't have to worry whether you like their gifts or not.
Plot twist: She's Rebeca, married to Ryan George for five years.
I just love the dynamic of these two right here man they are so alike in terms of comedy tone!
The youtubeverse is happening *_*
Should make this a mandatory educational vid for high schoolers. Save us from tons of problems
Epic work. I just love how insane you guys make it seem.
Ryan is so funny sometimes
I love your vids so much!!!  😊
Ryan is getting really good with nailing the multiple impressions I couldn’t even tell
God love these videos!
Nah,this is just another pitch meeting, it's barely an inconvenience.
This is hilarious
I've always thought it was weird that there's no such thing as engagement rings for guys. You can tell a girl is engaged, but you can't tell a guy is engaged, but when they get married they both have a ring. Why?  Also, traditional bachelor/bachelorette parties with all the sexual stuff make me so uncomfortable. It feels like cheating right before your wedding.
"That's not negotiable, I don't know what to tell you" "Okay"  Lost it
1:48 ..
A little fun fact: the reason why it's tradition for the groom to not see the bride until the ceremony comes from back in the day when arranged marriages were more common in the United States. I've also heard it was used when women were traded for livestock... Not sure if that one is true. Either way, it was so the groom wouldn't back out 😂
Yeah that was a fun experience
Another video where George is with someone else than himself, just like every other video he has made
What the fuck guys... I watched both videos 30 times... You guys just keep saying go on the other channel to watch other Collab video....  Am I the first guy to get stuck into a fucking loop???
She's outside? What happened, I didn't suppose it is even possible!
So this guy wanders over here to pitch for a marriage. Very easy barely an inconvenience.
Omg! That’s my elementary school in the hood I grew up in. WHAT!? 😱
I found an inconsistency in the Ryan cinematic universe! At around 2:14 she mentions friends but in 'the first person to have friends' video he mentions that he is already married. This means that she can't have had friends because friends didn't exist yet.
Are they married in real life
Wouldn’t that be Adam and Eve
Your a Sandra Bullock ringer... please do a skit about her..😋😋🤣🤣🤣
2:57 Why do people call this "double"? It really is a "half standard".
The most epic crossover I’ve ever seen
This is your first collaboration that I have ever seen. I honestly thought you two were married. So, good chemistry 😄
I am surely not unfond of you Peggie, I tell you what
Oh so this was how Adam and Eve got married. That is tight.
Why does it looks so modern and not old timy?
That's the most passive aggressiveness I've ever seen
Whats a garter?
Get a Pre-nup
i was wondering why i got reccomended your quarantine videos
Is Ryan the male Julie or is Julie the female Ryan or some sort of both combination.
I didn't even realize that I wasn't watching Ryan's channel tbh.
The collab of the century!
I know what I heard - and matching tractors should definitely be a thing (and badgers)
The first person to get married is the first person to have a family
Oh,  I wish you would not have gone ahead and said “colab” as I hate when people speak in “abreeves”. Darn! I was just about to subscribe too😢
WAIT A MINUTE DO PEOPLE REALLY TAKE THE BRIDES GARTER OFF
I love it when white people pretend they are the first ones to invest things or their way has always been the way it's done. Real funny 😂
They love each other because they are the two main characters in this video.
Why is there 666 likes
Ah where the woman says p**** seriously
666 dislikes
The guy in the background getting the ball.... Lol
This made me realize just how weird weddings are😂
holy shit 666 dislike
My favorite thing about these types of videos is that even though they're supposedly the first people to be doing this shit, they're dressed in modern clothes, speaking modern language, and surrounded by modern architecture.
Womens life logic: more partys Mens life logic: I'm gonna go outside, kill an animal so we can eat it
Married is Tight
“Being married sounds hard” “Actually it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience” “Oh really?”
Definitely says something about him when you think its weird hes talking to someone else.
Can I ask in England  Do we do wedding showers  Or is it only in the US?
Serious question: did these 2 know /know about each other before making their channels? Did one see the other's video and think "I can do that"? They have the EXACT SAME idea. Odds of coincidence seem minimal.
Adam and Lillith
It sorta just feels like Julie was drunk and Ryan wasnt
This is just sad.... I'm sad now
So I’m trying to plan my wedding and this is perfect
Bet they are showing together
What is up with their eyes, green ??
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Brilliant! 😂
This was hilarious! Got married September under covid restrictions. No food or drink, no entertainment, we had first dance/father-daughter/mother-son. No other dancing. From walking down the isle to my bride and I driving away was half an hour. My fiance and I gleefully shattered most norms. Afterwards we were often told how unfortunate that we couldn't get our dream wedding. We would smile and nod but laugh later. We got the perfect excuse to do the wedding we wanted. The only thing we would have wanted different was for masks to have been unnecessary.
"Guy pretends to make a sketch to propose to his girlfriend"
Wow. This video has “married” in the title so I got a commercial about diamonds. Fucking gross
This video was released on my parents actual anniversary.
Wowowowowow
It's a double standard obviously
Super funny.
Not driding; this is part 1 of the best recorded thing of all time.
These people are huge fans of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. They have to be. This chick acts a lot like Dee, and the dialogue sounds like it came out of the show.
I like how there’s kids playing soccer in the background
Are you guys a actually married or just friends?
do americans know anything about history or what?🥴
Ooh it's a double standard. That's right.
"first people to ever get married" adam and eve : am i a joke to u
I hate most you-tubers because they are not funny and usually just click baits but love these 2, i can't get enough of both their channels. they make every normal thing so funny....
Guy in the back: XD
For richer or for poorer makes complete sense. What are you going to do, kick out your spouse if they can't make their half the rent?
Ryan George actually look normal 🤔
"Hey, you know how we've hanging out and having fun and stuff?" "Yeah" "Well, I wanna keep doing that until we're both dead." "Okay..."  "Wear this ring so people know we have an arrangement." "Alright... Who's this guy with you?" "He's a priest. I want you to swear to god you won't back out of this." "And why are we doing this?" "Tax purposes."
It's odd seeing him without the green screen XD
R
So, you have a marriage proposal for me? Yes, ma’am, I do!
Idea: the first person to drive a car
Oh my gosh, you guys are hilarious together! Perfect!
Hahahahaha perfectly on point for the majority of people
SOCIAL DISTANCE
Should’ve done a gay joke
Super EZ barely an inconvenience
DID HE SAY THAT ABOUT THE TIES AROUND THE HEAD BECAUSE OF THE ROOM???????????????
What I can't figure out is if this is two Ryan's or two Julie's??? vote R for Ryan and J for Julie... i vote jr.
Damn. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
I think your videos are better with the other guy. Down vote.
Indian parents: 3 parties ? Amateurs !!
I was not aware of this under the dress thing is this like... an actual thing?
Julie Nolke: into the Ryanverse
And then they get divorced right after lol
"Why do we need to alert the government?"  "I don't know"  "Fair enough"
Who came here from ryan george
Love it 😂
So is Ryan playing Julie or is Julie playing Ryan?!  When people who act almost exclusively with Themselves colab there's bound to be confusion!
I hope this collab was super easy...
Yeah, because like history isn't a thing. 😄
Lost me at "this is a double standard". Get f#cked.
A wedding planned in 4 minutes... wow
Lol this looks more like Wedding Pitch Meeting
This is disgraceful. Puts shame on marriage. I found this channel interesting but unfortunately it has a deeper agenda of demonizing marriage and unity. Truly, all is vanity on this earth. Lord protect us.
Found this channel originally through Ryan then become obsessed w the pandemic series
Funny, this was the same couple that got divorced.
Ah, financials, the #1 excuse people use to say they don't like someone
"It Virginal"  "Okay that's not entirely accurate" 🤣🤣🤣
I sense some simp game.
If these two aren't actually a real life married couple I, at least, hope they got to hook up with each other.   They seem made for each other...
I got all the way to the end before I realized this wasn't Ryan George's channel.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Oh my god you guys
1:08 That's what she said during the honeymoon
This and the divorce one is way better than either of your videos
I thought I wasn't going to like this cause of actual orgins of marriage but this was funny.
Absolutely stellar. 🤣
This is everything 2020 needed.
This video made me curious as to why men get down on one knee so I looked it up. Apparently knights get down on one knee in front of the their lords as a sign of respect so it only made sense to do that when attempting courtship. I know that marriage is kinda messed up but that's pretty cute 😊
Weird seeing him talking to someone else
Matching track suits!!!
great and love it
He forgot the brideprice
Ryan George is a treasure with his Pitch Meeting videos!
There's only one reason why Ryan wants to marry Julie. For Nolke.  He did it all for the Nolke!
I abosulutely love this
hey wait a minute YO OH MY GOD I FREAKED OUT IN PARAGRAPHS ON THIS PESTSONS YOURUBE YESTERDAY
man this is hilarious
LMAO
So....the first marriage is in this channel, n the first divorce in ryan's channel....
“Hey he’s that guy from the other channel!”
Do you think all guys are Ryan and all girls are Julie.  That would be tight.
2020: 5996
This is why I just want engagement pictures with no ring (because I don't like the idea of me wearing a ring before the wedding and not him), a wedding in a silver dress with no garter or dancing (because I already have too many white dresses and cannot dance) and a honeymoon (and I want to take my bf's name cause mine has been butchered my whole life).
I wanted this collab so badly and now that it happened im sick of this genre of humor
Did they just actually get married?
Julie is the most beautiful woman in earth
Wholesome
Getting married is tight
The honey moon never came up. He is gay right
Im still waiting for the first baby...
this is tight
best of both worlds
This was soo fucking awesome! Great vid
it's good to talk these things out before the wedding
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
if we have weird people, like Aliens, time travellers, or anyone who does not understand how humans do human stuff, we should point them to your videos.
This should be ALL the collaberations ;P two brilliant comedians making us laugh :)
there is just some random guy putting up a goal behind them
Is this canon in the ryan george cu
So...... Canadia is a big place. What are the odds they live in the same .... Hockey Rink? Igloo? What do people live in up north? 😉
How did Canadians corner the "talking to yourself comedy" market?
We done
So Canadian lol
"Somehow that sounds a little shady but I'm into it" 😂
I love both of these two lol.
Omg
OMG.  This is too accurate.  I especially feel called out becaaaaaaaaauuuusse... I'm going to be watching the divorce one, becaaaaaaaauuuussse...  ... lol
The only good thing to come out of this year was this collab.
Getting gifts is tight!
The person in the background is like wtf are they talking about
2020 Adam and Eve
Is it just me or are Ryan + Julie their own hit YouTube channel that needs to become a reality like right now? All I want for Christmas, Santa.
Enter: Adam and Eve
"Are you just saying that so you don't have to go shopping with me?" 🤣🤣🤣
He got down on one knee so he already scored a point over Logan Huntzberger (even if he was just tying his shoe)
So funny
So it is an extended universe.  the Ryan Extended Universe
Julies plug for Ryan is the same as his was for her. :D
Given the monstrosity that is Ryan's son, I'm glad that he didn't CG a girlfriend to do this sketch.
It's a shame these two divorced...
I've never heard of Julie before this but I'm defiantly a fan now
Well, if you live with Ryan in Montreal, you don't have to call yourself George. It's even illegal to do so! Yeah we're quite "liberal" here. But liberal here are like Republican in USA. But not anymore because CAQ. It's complicated.
This is amazingly unfunny.
See, I was just wondering if the two of you had ever done a video together, and wouldn't that be a hoot, and this popped up!  Is YouTube reading my brain waves now?
THIS VIDEO IS A LIE!  Only Ryan's inhabit this world who is this woman!!????!!!!!!!!
At least if she gets a nice dress, it'll be something she can wear to other events and special occasions, so it'll be a sensible investment.
Wait??? Is your boyfriend the dude from pitching movies channel? Wahhh, I love you guys!
this makes me realize how unusual marriages parties are....
Omg I LOVE this!!!
What are you down there? Oh! I was tying my shoe but then I wanted to ask you that so then I asked you that oh! And you dropped ur ring Me: so this is how proposals where created
Just needs Daniel Thrasher to complete the loop.
This is the best!!! 🤣🤣🤣
You missed out.  Julia: and after the last party we have to consummate the night. Ryan: consummating is tight...
A woman complaining about double standards? 😱 jk
Omg😂😂 this is hilarious. It shows how ridiculous weddings are in reality. I love your videos! I just found you because of Phillip DeFranco and all of your videos make me laugh out loud, which doesn't happen much these days. 😂
The best part is the player getting the soccer ball out of the goal in the background.
American weddings are weird.
Ryan George and Julie in the same vid. What is this: a crossover episode?
Thx to Ryan for showing me this angel to bad he feels differently after one video lmao
🤣😅😂 Awesome!
Is it just me or does Julie look like Simmi Singh, but with lighter features? Both are stunning!
I just moved to Canada from the states and common law is such a joke. Buy your woman a ring and get offically married "she doesnt have to take his last name or anything" but common law is such a cop out for men here. Ive just seen men and women living together taking advantage of this grey area in the law.  Common law is like a get out a jail card on a relationship because either the man or the woman dont know how to ask the partner to offically commit.   *Omg these canada's dont know how to directly tell people what they want it's so annoy. Stop trying to beat around the bush or sweep stuff under the rug!  I need more transparency with these canadas its so dumb its like middle school nonsense. 💯 🇺🇲 rant over! 🤣
I feel I need to do a "pitch meeting" video where I interview the writer pitching this skit, said writer to be played by myself.
That was a quick relationship; proposed, parties, married, presents, party, kids, divorce all in one day. Only question is who got all the toasters that people bought you?
You forgot the part were one of you can break the other ones heart and take them for everything they own and not feel bad about it !
I'd like it if weddings were super easy, barely an inconvenience
The funniest thing is that some guys are still willing to marry! Can you imagine the willful ignorance or self-deception required for that?! She'll cheat, he'll pay.
Oh I get it it's a double standard, that killed me
"Well, it's virginal"
Love your videos! 💜
"OK, that's not entirely accurate..." LOL
Like my mom and dad they would hate each other soon
They didn’t even social distance
The one subject that would've been weird in the Ryanverse...
The most important question was never asked!!! Is this gonna involve exclusive.... making out rights??!
Are these two actually in a relationship?
Witty, intelligent and funny as always. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Oh it's the double standards
The video is lol but in reality, dude, if you ever have to negotiate with a chick like that.... LEAVE!!!
Very logical collaboration!
Pitch
This is hilarious!
it should be more like Canadiens getting married  Yah, ok  that sounds good eh?
Reason I subscribed to Julie.  Cuz she divorced Ryan. Wait???!!! Wrong video
If they are the first one to get married how do they still live
2:55 lmaooo thank you 👏
This is clever
Here's an idea, do something like, "The First People to Fall In Love", "Have a Crush", or something like that.
Watching this was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
😂
I'm sorry, but I can't find a "super easy, barely an inconvenience" moment... So I'll have to ask You to give me the exact timestamp and in case there's no such moment -> redo the clip  Thanks! ;)
are you thinking flu or coma?
This was bloody brilliant !!
“Oh double standards, i get it, okay”
"It's a double standard" yea like you don't have to get him a $10k ring.
2:55 had me cringe XD Exactly my thoughts
Hahaha I like your videos guys!! You always make my day Julie
These two actually have a lot in common
you guys are amazing
Big thanks for this collaboration, it lead to me to Ryan's channel and his Pitch Meetings made me laugh so hard :-)  It is unusual to come across something original and great during 2020.
I’m so happy for you guys
I did not know that the groom uses his mouth to take off the garter. Imagine not knowing that on your wedding day until it happens.
I want to see them to do this again, except with Indian weddings 😂
"Wanna get married?" "Sure, sounds great, barely an inconvenience."
Congratulations! You two are so cute.
I never thought about the last name thing like that before, about the owning thing🤔. But it is a hella lot of paperwork, for sure. A friend of mine has been married/divorced three times, (I’ve only been once, and that paperwork was bad enough). And now to get that license that lets you fly, she has to bring, her birth certificate, each marriage certificate. each divorce paper, and any papers that show she has reverted back to her birth name. For each time😱. All have to be certified copies. The guys, they just need their birth certificate.
Jesus Christ she has so many Patreons, must be rich
1:49 I'm glad you addressed the weird and unnecessary nature of this tradition 😂😂
*What is this, a crossover episode?*     (Hey, _someone_ had to...)
I love her description of Ryan's channel, lol
THANK YOU FOR BEING A SHINING LIGHT IN THE DARK!!!!
Is this the guy from pitch meeting?
“Lick whipped cream off of six pack abs”. What? Huh? What?
So courtship is a joke? And these broads wonder while they are tattooed drug addicted single mothers lol
As an Asian watching this, WHAT IN THE NAME OF...????
Thanks
I’m gonna have to check the bible on this one...
“Oh, it’s a double standard, I get it”  You guys are killing it!!!!
“So, you have a proposal for me?”  “Yes sir I do!”
Should have gave her an apple
"So we should stay together forever?" "Yeah yeah yeah" "wow wow wow wow wow....wow."
"We can make a list" "Oh im listening"
Ok so this video introduced me to Julie and after binge watching her content *I prefer her to Ryan*
2:36 the guy in the background like 👁👄👁
I would like to see them on the walking dead
Why do we do this? 🤣 Why? It's bizarre.
Not that there's not a double-standard with the whole last name thing, but you do in fact identify both people as married by the fact that they have the same last name, it just happens to have originally come from one of the people in particular. Bad system, but I just think the line where the man isn't identified as being married to the woman is specifically a bit off. Great video though!
Ryan at this point is much more comfortable and natural talking to himself.
@2:31 - I feel personally attacked...🤦🏼‍♀️😆😂
Well that was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
"Take my last name." "Sounds hard." "It'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience."
Wait a minute, is this their way of weeding announcement?
Awkwardly pointing out that women care only about money, abs, and as much penis as they can get from anybody but the man they say they love.
*The people in the back listening to Julie and Ryan 👁👄👁:*
This will be super easy barely an inconvenience
This will be super easy barely an inconvenience
So they married and divorced in the same day. Okay.
Holy shit marriage is so complicated hot daymnn...
congrats guys 🎉🎉
You know... Both of you channels kind of revolve around you talking to yourself... That's the whole joke. By combining it and talking to each other, you basically made a video about a conversation.
Love both your guys' channels! My wife and I were sooo stoked to see a collab video. You guys are 🔥🔥🔥

The White Dress comes from Boston in the late 1800's. The city was filthy with dirt streets, horses and all that. So a family would have their daughter were a white dress to prove that they were wealthy enough to buy a dress that could only be worn once.  See, nothing new under the sun.
You two really should marry
These two channels ROCK! ! ! !
I am ready with a ring for you hun...😂😂🥰🥰
"Oh - it's a double-standard..."
Congratulations! 🎉🎊💐👏🌹🌟 Soon we will have four people in pitch meetings!
Wait, have the men wear ties around their head?  When does that ever happen?  I've been to numerous weddings, and I don't think I've ever actually seen that.  Well, except in the mangas where the boss makes you drunk and have you dance on the table with your ties around your head.  Also, the guy going under the woman's dress and taking her garter off with his mouth in front of all the relatives?  What the hell?  When did this ever happen?  I don't think I've ever seen that.  Not even in the movies or manga.
Being the first couple to ever get married must have been really difficult.  Actually, it was super easy. Barely an inconvenience.
😂😂😂 love it
100% accurate.  Weddings are stupid. lol  I honestly want my money back.
“Thats a lot of parties.“ So. You have not been to a Puerto Rican wedding
I really like Julie. She is so funny, expressive, pretty, and quick-witted. I just want to say, though, that this is very cynical...a trend I see in Julie's material that I hope changes!  Its the satire of modern deconstructionism (masked as progressivism)...which pretty much condemns all institutions and traditions as bad and belittles--in this case by satire. The American wedding actually is a medley of a lot of cultures and is rooted in the idea of community support, sacrifice, humility, joy, and faithfulness... its bolstered by the Abrahamic religions--which are becoming increasingly less tolerated.  I think maybe we could look back in history and see where it was done right, and that would be a whole lot better than standing on the side lines and making everyone look dumb.     -------   "its just a joke". I know-I get it. But there is an old proverb that goes "from the mouth is the overflow of the heart"--I think that is real truth.
Ryan George is funny
My current faves together omg
Why does the man propose from a kneeling position? For the same reason Catholics genuflect when facing an altar. Behind the altar (a stand-in for a king) is a wall. A king’s throne is always backed by a wall to prevent attacks from behind. When approaching a king subjects kneel, as it’s harder to mount an attack from a kneeling position. Similarly a handshake forces us to open up our hand, showing we aren’t hiding a weapon. If a man proposes and is rejected, the kneeling position makes it safer for the female.
I'm gonna need you to get alllll the way off my back about this marriage thing.
Was it super easy, barely an inconvenience?
I love that this came after the divorce one
“Because it’s virginal”  “That’s not entirely true”  🤣 why did I like this so much?
“I’m listening” 😆
wooooo I ship it
Haha, the best
I thought of this sketch and it reminded me of your channel.  I hope you can check it out https://youtu.be/M7XiF_atjko
I didn't know anything about this Ryan George guy before this collaboration but I've spent the last three days going through ALL the Pitch Meetings and now I want to sleep with him even more than I want to sleep with you. Pretty dumb move, Vanessa.
Yeah..this is how it all started..thanks guys for doing this to the humanity 🤒
So funny! Always get the government involved when taking about love.
Batman vs Superman ?
Barely an inconvenience really
The guy putting up the football net listening in the background like 🤔
Basic elements of comedy: Intentionally mismatched semantic components both literally and metaphorically. Subverted expectation or fulfilling those carefully assembled constructs in unexpected or absurdist ways. Violation of subliminal societal norms. Have I forgotten anything? This is close but no cigar. We forgive their crass materialism and their complete lack of passion perhaps it's endearing in the suspension of disbelief envelope. Mostly it's just that a bunch of us find the girl attractive enough to keep watching everything she posts and notice along the way that she's funny.
Well they just wore dresses of any color until queen Victoria made it popular when she got married and wore white. So maybe she didn't  get a white dress.
"Oh so you have a collab for me ?"  "Yes sir I do"
2:35 the person struggling with the bunting
omg two of my favs together this is great
This video clearly shows how insane getting married is for both men and women.
Non negotiable 🤣🤣🤣
That's the most spontaneous proposal ever😂😂😂
This is when the guy should be going oh crap I made a mistake
So Julie... When are we getting married?
Ohhh my two favourite Youtube comedians!!! I am elated~ Also, I loved the concept, very funny 😂 And you know what? You guys would actually make a lovely couple~
I've been watching videos of both Julie and Ryan for a long time, great unexpected collab! Love you Canadian guys! 🙂
0:00 I can't decide if you guys did this separately and it has been put together, if you are incredibly small or if Ryan George is incredibly tall..
I died @ 2:34!! that whole exchange killed me! "Oooooooh... Oh! It's a double standard! Oh, I get it. Ok. Yeah. That's fine." "Fantastic!"
When he said “fun for who” in regards to the garter I died cause ain’t that a mood
The most ambitious crossover of all time
As if any of this historically and traditionally was ever a mutual decision between two actually consenting adults until *shrugs* IDk MAYBE the 70's? Marriage traditionally worldwide has always been almost entirely about the owning and pretty much selling off of AFAB women (and really for the majority of history- AFAB female children) as AMAB male property between families.   So an accurate depiction of " the "First Marriage" ought to show two families where subservient AFAB women give birth to an immediately AFAB child and then the 'husbands' of these women are informed of the birth of their 'useless female' child at an AMAB male entertainment venue. Then these two AMAB men turn to each other and begin discussing the uselessness of having a "female" child and how " shes going to be such a burden to spend money on and take care of and raise just to end up being an object in some other families household" Then another man sitting nearby who's dealing with some financial ruin and looking to gain a dowery from his son's marriage so that he can get himself out of debt mentions that he's got a son who's only already nearly twenty years of age and needs a wife but hasn't settled down yet and by the time this man's useless daughter is of age ( so like eight years old back in the day) His son should be well off enough in his business or trade to take care of his own household. Another man similarly offers up his son to the other man's' useless' daughter and on the spot, the marriages are arranged.   "The first marriage "in a white patriarchal society- or any patriarchal society that employes the construct of marriage as an excuse to buy sell and trade women-  if it were being portrayed at all honestly, would universally depict a transaction involving a group of AMAB cis men sitting around at a men's club or entertainment venue-  buying and selling off their 'useless' female children, and yes I DO mean CHILDREN to other fully grown men. The ending scene would have an " eight years later" With a child wearing a formal gown made to give her the shape and appearance of a fully grown woman sitting and crying next to a fully grown man looking down at her in open boredom and annoyance at best.   That would be an honest depiction of your romanticized notion of the "first" in a long line of the disgusting reality of hundreds of years of child trafficking devaluing of human females and AFAB people- incalculable incomprehensible eons of oppression. Put that in your vows you cishet patriarch worshiping quiet misogyny petting breeders and your heteronormative agenda.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
two of my fav youtubers yay
Are you guys dating
So that's what happened, make a lot of sense now
You both look cute together. Love From India. Visit here someday. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You two have great chemistry! an excellent comedy duo - you could kill every comedy club in the UK with your sketches :)
A lot of "super easy, barely an inconvenience" jokes in the comments 🤣  and love the all 😆😅🤣😂
Oh!?!
🤣🤣🤣🤣  dude this is f*cking fire
This is the only way I could have a relationship. SCRIPTED
“Getting married sounds hard.”  “Actually it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience”.
Ryan!!!
So good, love your leather jacket by the way!
fun fact people didnt use to wear white wedding dresses they justbwore their best dress but then when queen victoria wore a when dress in her wedding to prince albert and influenced other people to do so and it just became the normal
This is hilarious haha!
The CGI in these is getting so good, I can hardly tell that it's two Ryan Georges talking to each other.
So engagement on this channel and divorce on the other...that was quick
Why does it sound insane?! Lol
This is the first time I've seen these two talk to someone other than themselves
Sounds a little shady, but I'm into it.
Here before 1M views
If I asked my girlfriend to be in a video she’d tell me she doesn’t get payed enough
RYAN
The woman behind Ryan playing with the net is a metaphor for goals, also how the heck did you even get Ryan out of his universe
Julie,where do you come up with such funny ,but true stories? Lo detour facial expressions, hilarious.
This collab makes me so happy!!! I'm so glad you guys created together - LOVE both videos! <3
Reading these comments has convinced me that Julie has a real catchphrase shortage.
This was great at pointing out the level of awkward a proposal is.
I ship this. 😂
the person who invented marriage was sooo creepy like "I love you soo much so I'm gonna get the government involved so you won't leave"
As a hindu, I felt the need to humbly include my comment in this beautiful comment section:          *what the fuck*
Two champions right here 😂 amazing
When i watched your videos... I thought wouldn't it be cool if Ryan and you Collab or something... And there were are
Omg so hilarious!!!
What's funny?
That's TIGHT!
Their marriage is going to last even less than the time it took  guy in the back from 2:34 and the thing he's hanging to disappear
Julie: Planning this wedding is going to take many months! Ryan: Nah, we'll just call over a few close friends and family. In fact, it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience...
Can you put an arabic translation please , it will be cool 😎😛
fun fact: wedding dresses weren't white but then the rich started doing it  so all the peasantry in England followed
Vote no on prop 22
Is this the guy from screenrants
I could NOT identify where the guy was from
The sheer grounded pragmatism of Ryan saying it's risky to wear all white clothing is my favorite part.
Here I am, just discovering your channel today, watching your 'pandemic' video's and thinking to myself: "She should collab with Ryan, that would be awesome.". Mr. Late to the Party right here.
This is hilarious
Like the first person who got married was so paranoid about his relationship that he decided to get the government involved
Nice sketch!  But I'm pretty sure the link between "wedding" and "virginal" was probably a man's idea...
Wow, this video feels much better than the other Ryan George ones, because here he actually has an actinng partner, that he seems to even have some chemistry with
pls make more videos together! love the video
It would've been better if he was actually tying his shoe laces before nonchalantly recalling that he wanted to propose
A shower.. that sounds tight!
In my culture a wedding gift list would be the rudest thing ever, like I'm already offering you a present consider yourself lucky!
Maybe the people who have made the video have seen this, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqz4JETekYM&list=WL&index=28
MCU was not the best crossover in history.
This entire skit is blasphemy.  I know... that's sort of the point.  But it doesn't mean I have to enjoy it :/
Amazing.
I ship it
making people buy things strictly from a list is tight !!!!. also planning all this new crap will be super easy bearly an innconvience !!!!! yaaa wow....wow wow.
This is so funny because so many of these wedding traditions make absolutely zero sense.😂
I’m surprised to see Julie marrying herself
they are literally the same but ones a man and the other is a woman. how?
Woww Looks like convo Sheldon and Amy would have 😅
I like both these weirdos
Let's also get the government involve with our relationship and if we ever have a problem in the future and want to break up it would be more troublesome. Marriages are pretty weird though. Not because of the weddings and celebrating their lovez that's kinda sweet. It's just weird to get the government involve in your relationship.
Yesss!! Two youtubers that I love working together ❤️❤️
In the first weddings black was the dress color, white used to be used for funerals
Ryan sent me
First couple to get married would've been a long time ago. They probably thought they'd only live another 10 years anyways.
Julie George 😂😂😂
Are they actually dating? I mean, is she really the future Mrs. Ryan George?
Also, I just want to follow you to get you off this devlish subscriber number lol
She reminds me of CW's Nancy Drew
To whomever signs the prenuptial, “Whosever commits to infidelity, loses Everything.”
Love both of you so love these collabs!
Julie is a man's woman, not a woman's woman. Just something I noticed and thought I should put this out there.
The nerd in me who actually knows how all of these traditions started is like 😰😰🤯🤯🤯
"That's a lot of parties."  Soo you haven't been to an Indian wedding then.
IM CRYING!!!!!!
69k likes. Nice
In my country no one take anyones name
First married couple: Adam and Eve
😂😂
Ahahahaha, they're genius!
I’m all in for the Julie channel! Nothing like a big dose of sarcasm! Sweet!!
Eu sou brasileiro e sou seu fâ. Belo trabalho!
I would ship these guys 10/10 Regardless, great content!!!!
when you put it in a perspective, these traditions are the most ridiculous thing the straights have created.
Strangely, finances don't significantly affect divorce rates much.
Wait what this isn't Ryan's channel
The guy fooling with the soccer netting is so underrated 😬
Haha...this one is pretty awesome...and hanging out with a bunch of dudes with a stripper is awkward.
😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻
4:02 is that an accidental actual shot of a girl struggling to push her bike up a slope in real life? that's precious in youtube video terms
If it was the First marraige   Then how the hell do you have Relatives ? 🙄
I think Rory Pond would like to have a word about the whole name-changing "double standard" 😂
Ryannmnnnn
Miss Julie, if you were my wife, you'd be getting pregnant tonight! Big facts.
This made me so anxious 😂😂😂
This video is TIGHT! WOW WOW WOW
This is the crossover event 2020 needed.
What!... what?!
ya pretty solid deal
What!? When did they collab?
You gotta do a Pitch Meeting crossover!!!
this was so fking good lmao
This is amazing ! Hope to see more video from you two !
No one:  Me: Yeah so anyways I did a backflip, snapped the bad guy's neck, and saved the day.
I love this
WOW!!!
You know what, as human, it's about making a dession about 'ourselves' in order to commet. (to whatever) And on ther side, If you don't that's kool too. Either way, it's a statement of our selves. and that can matter to u or not
I just watched an earlier vid from JN and had to go back to 'like' I forget cuz I'm high and typing feh great....so just saying a good job to me, and I mean JN (lick a 6 cream off a guy chest...the another way around I think...(got it) ok so where you at?... Im still going...What the hell was I gonna comment on? Oh yeah, I I forgot to put a 'like' click....got it now WOOHOO success. Anywho....
Great idea, Julie! Awesome 👏🏻
I just came to watch this after first person to get a divorce from Ryan George
this was AIB honest series + bb ki vines
Great Collab! Love both these channels
Plot twist: this is Ryan and Julie's actual wedding announcement.
you're beautiful
Genital shaped accessories and autumnal forest ... this was great 😂
Collabs of two talented, funny creators is TIGHT!
GENIOUS

better crossover then avengers!
mmmmmmm craving a movie pitch crossover now.
your content is SOLID ! I love all of your stuff
“For the rest of our lives” *gets divorced that very day on Ryan’s channel*
I don't know if either one of them involved with anyone else romantically, but I ship them. 😂
Well, now we know what boys look like in Julies universe, and what girls look like in Ryan’s.
Canada is a fucking wild place man
Sounds shady, but im into it!
So you have a wedding for me. "Yes, sir I do"
Just realized Julie's actual size...it explains so much. Lol
LOVE this collaboration!! You're both awesome x
And this is exactly why I eloped on a boat. Not even kidding. My husband and I pulled a Jim & Pam.
I first saw the divorce clip. 😈👿😎
My hand slipped my phone fell on my face and I accidentally disliked the vid. I undid the dislike but holy wow so it IS tru that dislikes do come from accidents.
People who actually have marriages like this confuse me 😂
It’s the soccer player struggling with his ball in the background for me
I don’t know if this is how it happened
Omg this was so smart and funny! XD Loved it!
Ironic how it took social distanciation to bring together two actors who became successful by talking to themselves.
So, you got a sketch about getting married for me?
.... Barely an inconvenience....
OMG my two favorite YT Creators getting together to make something awesome! Yes! More!
I laughed so hard at the name change discussion - "oh, there's no need for that" XD
“I think we should tell the government about this conversation.”
I have never seen julies channel, but holy crap her channel is awesome!!  I subscribed after binging a lot of the episodes in the same fashion I did with Ryan George 😂
*#MGTOW* - based on experience. Hell, she didn't even give up her last name - and still took and took and took. Live on your own women, and take your *not-my-kids* from your previous relationship failures, with you. Not my kids, not my problems. Go be "strong and independent" on your own.
Wow wow wow...wow
I came here from the pandemic videos, and I'm amazed. Julie, you're hella funny!
Collab videos of people who usually talk to themselves talking to each other is TIGHT!
Thanks for the laughs. That was far more funny then I expected it to be.
This is so funny oh my god
You guys would make a great couple
omfg. matching track suits. That should be a thing.
Exactly why I'm not changing my name. My personal opinion, but just because I'm getting married shouldn't mean I have to change my name and he doesn't. If you want to do that, great, but I think it should be up to the couple.
Julie at the end:  Hi hello its me I'm the ad-stonant. Im  here in ad space to talk to you about ryan George
Eyyyy this was so nice to watch! :) Two of my favorite YouTubers!!!
Julie george
3:04 Soccer Net
I ❤️ this! So true! So true!
Holy shit, I never made the connection, but your styles are oddly similar. That's great!
This looks like a marriage that will last a lifetime
Im surprised Ryan didn't throw in a "Super easy barely an inconvenience" in either the marriage or break up video.
⏱⏱ I haven’t laughed all week Julie It’s Thursday  I need my fix I need my comedic upload
Imagine the people at the park being incredibly confused watching the awkwardest marriage proposal ever
How were they even born
Ryan George! 😂❤
I just came here from his tick tock
Ryan sent me here!
Julie George does have a ring to it
It was super easy. Barely an inconvenience
I love that you post amazing travel content! So we are a couple that travels too and would like to work with you. Maybe we can do a video together or share eachother on our social media platforms. Would you be down? If you're down, our IG is @rayeandty
This is good! 😊👌
Just saying u got my sub from Ryan’s channel pls do more stuff with him
Just realized you and Ryan George should be a mirror couple if you both  colab again. Something tells me skits where one couple discusses a crazy  situation with another couple would play off your individual channel's  shtick of one actor playing multiple roles much better.
I just subscribed to Ryan's channel. It was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
My god, nearly identical video views and subscriber counts. You two really are made for each other!
YESSSS AAAAAAAA you two are a dream team.
The crossover i didn't know was possible. But so happy it happened?
Good stuff, you guys should collab again in the future :)
Sounds about right. Don't forget that whoever marries you may unthinkingly pronounce you "man and wife" instead of "husband and wife", further emphasizing how one traditionally belonged to the other and the man's status did not necessarily change.
Oo risky 😂😂😂😂
Love it, great collab
We need pandemic Julie in October!!
Hi Julie!  It's time for another time travel pandemic episode!!!
God bless and have a good day!!
julie needs to get into some kind of sitcom fast, her comedic acting is great
I kinda love Canadians now :p
I'd rather the Ryan MCU than this
If the custom started with her begging me I might have gone for it in life
ok, that was really funny!
Hilarious
okay, this is good, really good
They actually have great chemisty , unlike other youtube collabs. Are they dating in real life?
Definitely can see why Julie is the only other person allowed into the Ryanverse.
I watched the other video first so now it looks like you're getting remarried after getting divorced.
Who else came for Ryan and stayed for Julie?  It's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I've been a follower for a long time and love your channel!  You might get even more views if you outro each video with a catchy phrase like... "Stay Funky Bros" or the Canadian equivalent? :) Cheers!
Flu or coma 😂😂😂😂😂
did anyone see the guy in the net lols
YouTube’s recommendations have not failed me!
def matching track suits
Well, if he's in, I'm out.
Ryan George squad where you at
That was super easy barley an inconvenience 😂
Now do Myka and James Stauffer,  you crazy couple! Immitate it or just watch their narrative as the crazy couple you are! I'm still the brain child of your divorce here, like Huxley. Gonna put it on my resume, Comment Creator!
More collab you guys are perfect for each other
My 2 fav Canadians
Ryan your smooth as a.. uh.. as a... uh... There's um a thing I'm supposed say! It's... Smooth as you!
You two did a good job on these colabs. Very fun
OMG JULIEEEEE I'M GOING TO MEET WITH YOU ON A GOOGLE MEET WIH MY CLASS
2:35 the backround is my struggles with soccer
Great collaboration! Now to check out your other videos!
Somehow saw Ryans video first, missed both sets of notifications somehow. Got to say, you two are my favourite YouTubers so you both in the same video was a real treat!
Where are the masks I'm nervous
Both videos are AWESOME
This sketch is really good at convincing anyone that marriage is a sham.
"You go up under my dress and take my garter off with your mouth."  "Oh that would be a fun activity!"  "And you do it in front of all of our blood relatives."  "Oh no I don't want that all.. "
Came here because of Ryan, stayed because the videos are awesome!
I found you from Ryan's channel. Your videos are awesome! 😂😂😂
Um, actually, wedding dresses didn't use to be white commonly. The color white was impractical in eras where laundry wasn't particularly optimal or simply reserved for higher society. White becoming a common color for wedding dresses is relatively recent.
Subscribing to you was super easy, barely an inconvenience !
God level acting
Oh, and your father should lead you to your groom and pass your hand to his to symbolise the passing of responsibility/guardianship/control. Maybe it should be called ‘giving away’. And all the speeches at the wedding should be by men. Even if the thought of them talking about you in front of everyone and trying to make jokes terrifies you.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This video didn't have enough Julie and Ryan clones.
Great colab with perfect matching 2 videos. Loved it.
Black Kratos opens Pandoras box!?
I’ve learned so much about weddings from this video
OMG this is so exhaustive☹
First couple to ever bang
aziz did the bit better, still funny tho
Loved it she’s so sexy commentary’s the end sealed the deal thankyou Ryan George for showing her to us and where the hell is the addstronot. Get him to call his brother would ya he misses you Ryan George call him he’s your brother for goodness sake.
I can imagine the wedding party guests all looking like Ryan and Julie.
Oh screenrant pitch guy; cool
Ryan: You gotta get us something from this list... Julie: That sounds a little shady, but I'm into it...  Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ON SIN WILL TAKE YOU TO HELL BUT CHRIST WILL TAKE YOU OUT listen the Bible predicts stuff happening right now and you don’t want to be non believer in Christ not now especially now the mark of the beast will be forced on the right hand or forehead DO NOT TAKE the MARK OF THE BEAST   Have the grace of God while the door is opened read the Bible and believe the gospel which is this God came down as man (Christ Jesus) to die so if anyone believe in Him will not perish but have everlasting life  Edit: read Romans 10:9-13
Adam and eve were the first people too
😂 this is great
Dang! This is the crossover I never knew I needed!
Julie I would LOVE to marry you and there wouldn't be ANY double standards, I promise.  You can also bail if I end up in a coma for say, more than 2 months.
Julie, I think you are confused. Ryan does not make videos of him talking to himself. He makes videos of many different people. For example, Scriptwriter Guy and Producer Guy couldn’t be more different people.
Funny
The dude who plays the producer in Ryans Pitch Meetings looks good here in drag. Super passable.
Anyone married to Ryan is good enough for me. SUBscribed!
That turned out way better than i anticipated...
Ads: "hey, want to learn how to make quick money" Me: 2:47
"Is there a way to force people to get us only stuff we like?" "Well, we could make a list" "Ooh, making lists is TIGHT!" "Would it be hard to make the list?" "Actually no. It'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience".
I. WANT. MORE!
getting divorced 5 minutes after the proposal: super easy, barely an inconvenience.
You two look like a real couple!
I love it!!!
Still waiting for the September Julie to see her past self
Two of my favorites! More collabs with Ryan please
Is this how proposals work in Canada🤔
This was an awesome collab. Love both your channels. Keep up the good work.
Love, love your videos
How dare you, try to make me ship Ryan with someone other than himself!
And the karen was born
Love the dual release of divorce and marriage... you finally did the co op!
Am i the only person who saw ryans video first,  Then got recommended your quarantine video, then binged a bunch of your videos,  Then thought, gee your style is very ryan george esc  Then think, wouldn't it be cool if you made a video with Ryan, then go to your channel see your latest video, remember ryans video I saw just a few days ago, and realise I'm an idiot?   Or is that just me?
badges would be tight
"Wear all white" "oh risky" 😆
"See you back here next week" - This channel is the closest thing I have to a therapist.
MY TWO FAVORITE PERSONS IN ONE VIDEO ARE YOU KIDDINGGGGGGG THANK YOU <3
Weddings: Super difficult, very much an inconvenience
Julie, it's October, the orange one has covid, there were 5 hurricanes otg at one point.. any plans for a part 3 for explaining the pandemic? y'know... before the US election... and the asteroid/cascadian subduction zone/california big one/yosemite super volcano/etc.
A woman gets naked and we all feel awkward.  I thought it was just me.
stupid
My favorite part was how he gets out of shopping for the dress.
So................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................are you guys banging?
Subbed! Found you from the divorce video on Ryan's channel!
Badges, matching tracksuits??? That would have been good...we went with rings.
Super script, and fabulous act!
“Oh! Oh it’s a double standard, that’s fine!” I’m DEAD!
Two great creators who are completely unrelated (in my head), suddenly doing a collab - awesome!
I just wanted to let you know that this is the first time I have watched one of your videos, and I got here from the link on the one you did for Ryan's channel, in case you are keeping track of that type of thing.
Six feet apart. Perfect
Nailed it!! 😂😂👍
Please more collabs with you two! Perfect match 👍
"and then we can spend a month of vacation in an exotic place" " a whole month? That would be expensive!" " well, more like a week or two, but we will pretend and call it a month to seem more impressive to others" "wow wow wow, wow"
Is this Julie's way of saying she secretly got married?
I see you have a new video idea for me. Yes sir I do...
Ya this will be a lot of paper work for you.
Marriage: Super hard, extreme inconvenience.
marriage --> barely an inconvenience.
Great you found someone as lame as you
So glad I didn’t change my name. Don’t. Anyone.
The leather jacket takes me out of this. isn't she supposed to be playing a generic woman or something?
Ryan: Julie is TIGHT!!
I love julie 😍😭
Yes.This is what I needed. These people are amazing.
Funny people should get married for the lols.
They would be so perfect for eachother... but at the same time not.
The characterization of the bachelor and bachelorette parties was so spot on
Worlds collide
Cool collab from canadiens! The fact that your are from canada doesn't change much but it's still cool!
Wow great shit! My favorite white people! Cheers from L.A.! You guys are so damn funny I was totally blindsided by you two lolol jejeje!
My two favorite people work together. NIIIICE!!!
Man, both videos have the same number of views right now
Nice jacket
I'd like to think that coming up with this idea for a video was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Giving away half your stuff seems super easy, barely an inconvenience.🤓
2:32: With a big what?
It's so weird seeing Ryan George in a video that's not in the Ryan George Cinematic Universe 😮
Thanks Collabstronaut. I didn't get the notification for this.
That's a nice jacket She got on
Legendary! Love u both! More please!
Re ending. Yeah I'd hate to watch someone talk to themselves. Who'd do that.
I really liked the video Julie George
You guys are great. Keep doing these.
This is the most lit thing I've watched in a while😂😂😂😂
Man they look the exact same as the first people who got divorced.
Also, your mom and dad insisted I give them a goat and some money before I'm allowed to have you. Did you know about this?
Now it's "wanna combine our funds and get government benefits...unless the government does the opposite instead"
Taking his name is opinions these days, same as when you divorce taking his house, money and children is optional but most women do it...
Ryan sent me here!! You got a new subscriber, keep up the great work 💯😁
Enjoyed this one! I discovered this channel because of Ryan George.
The two people who are great at talking to themselves, are talking to each other.  it's weird!.  In other universe, mirror Juile and the producer Ryan are having the "talk". Fingers crossed they make it though the lockdown..
Kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel for content...
Getting people to come to three parties sounds kinda tough.  Actually it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.  Oh really?  Yeah, we'll have booze.   Wow wow wow wow.
Yeah whoever I marry, we're not going bachelor/bachelorette parties. Maybe a bridal shower and a decent boys night out. We'd have too much respect for ourselves and each other.
2:59 Its funny because now a days when people know you have the same last name, everyone knows the guy is the girls and not the other way around like in the video. lol
FUN FACT: Wearing white dresses is something that was started by the rich and only started getting related to virginity way later
In the sickness part, Definitely heard you say “COVID” instead of “ coma”  lol.
BEST. CROSSOVER. EVER.
I can see why this marriage didn't last...
only need trey and will complete the trinity
Pretty good!
It does sound super-shady... The delivery here is brilliant. These two have excellent comic chemistry!
Julie, was it just you who wrote this? That was bloody excellent writing. Wow.
Subtitles could use some work
Can we get a part 3 to the explaining pandemic to my past self series? Please?
Two icons collaborating like this is so exciting <3
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 great collaboration
That part about last names and the lack of need for the man to take his wife's. Nice ^^ I'll send that to friends if some of them ever get married ^^
Clever girl. "Oh I'm listening"
Red was the original Colour of the wedding dress but MATCHING TRACK SUITS
I was promised harpoons :(
I feel you both are secretly married
Honestly the best cross-over I could have hoped for. Now off to the divorce.
Well, turns out the best thing Ryan did this year was introducing me to your channel.
"Is there a way to force people to get us only stuff we like?" "Well, its gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience."
after : i dont want to be with you anymore whoops whoppsie me neither  !
Amazing writing. Loved the part about the dress and not having to go shopping for it!! "Just swept up in the moment". Sooo good 👍
Single man here, totally explains how i feel about marraige lol
Also, wedding planning in 5 minutes! No need to drag it out or agonize over every tiny detail, ladies...
How about one where they go on about kids?. I need to have kids.Why?.Oh to show my folks I can as they'll probably be pressuring me about having kids even if I have a great career.What about me?.Oh well you won't care until the kid wakes you up crying in the middle of the night.Then you'll pretend to be asleep as I grumble and trudge in there.Yeah,oh and I'll lose interest in you as you fail to lose the excess weight.The material writes itself.
Crossover episode
Hopefully next week she'll have those pictures they took in the autumnal forest
Julie George is a great name ngl
yes!!!! i want more...i know there's another one... but two is not enough
I called this crossover in a previous video!  This is great!
Coming to your channel was super easy barely an inconvenience
Expanded Julianolkeverse and Expanded Ryangeorgiverse overlap CONFIRMED
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂👌
It was a wedding pitch meating.
YES I LOVE BOTH OF YOU THIS FEELS LIKE THE BEST CROSS OVER EPISODE EVER!!!!
Whoever said that white was virginal had obviously never heard of a wet t-shirt contest. Also, Father/daughter and mother/son dances are both incestuous and creepy, and no one will ever be able to convince me otherwise.
This is great!! Love both of you guys!!
I do love this happy love story and I love that there's no indication that they are the same characters as in the other skit that I happened to watch first! So glad that you two are collab-ing at long last!
I don't think I've ever clicked on a video faster.
Some ryne guy sent me.
Best description of marriage I've seen.  Really like you two working together. Good chemistry.
TY
As always 🔥🔥🔥
I feel l like the Collab-stronaut should be the one to perform the ceremony
It was good but I kind of wish your face looked like his face...
That looks like the guy that ripped off Jenny Nicholson
I Stan my two favorite YouTubers in one video
Wait, is the taking the garter off with his mouth in front of their families a traditional thing in North America? Like people did this when the bride had to (at least pretend to) be a virgin?
How many times can i click "Like"?  Old joke, but it still applies.
He was tying his shoe. 😂
My first time watching this, greaaaat😂🤣😂🤣 stuff
No no no . . .go back to the badges and matching tracksuits . . . . . like, REAL badges, with the pins and everything and do the tracksuits have the three white stripes . . . . . . . .
Hilarious!
funny
This is a pairing I didn't know I needed
- So you have a marriage for me? - Yes sir I do! - So how many people are in this marriage? - Over 500. - Wow that's a lot of people. Are they all getting married? - No only 2 are, but others are there too. - Why? - Because! - Fair enough!
Nailed it! How did this "marriage" thing ever catch on!!!
yaay two of my fav youtubers collabing together 🥳💖
I found both of your awesome channels during the pandemic, so this collab was super exciting for me haha
Ryan George got me to subscribe
LOL
Oh finally! GO Canada!
That face when she said why dont you take my last name ? 😅😂😂
Was the person comically struggling with the soccer ball in the background part of the sketch?
Best Collaboration ever :)
Hilarious!❤️❤️
Yeah it might be the number one reason for why couples break up.
Imagine living in the 21st century and being excited as a woman to take a man's last name
Wait. What? There was another half!?
About Adstronaut: the earbuds are not good at all. Beware your credibility! IT CAN NOT BE BOUGHT! Look at future and reconsider at least endorsing the earbuds! Their low quality WILL reflect back on you, future products you endorse and your future products! Think, preferably test yourself, before you accept a contract! $ now are nice but perhaps not so much when they cost you in future! Love you & your work, bzw.
This is the team up I've been waiting for. Although weird to see Ryan not in front of a green screen.
Omg, I love the fact that both of my favorite youtubers collaborated! That’s such a highlight of my day! Thank you both!
That seemed super easy, barely an inconvenience.
The exact same subscriber count at Ryan lol
This comment will be buried.  But whatever.  You two are both some of my favorite youtube people and I would LOVE if you just did all your comedy together from here on.  And while we are at it, you both can just get married as well.  I think you're a good couple.
I'm dying 🤣
*Spongebob narrator voice* 2,000 year later
Make a explaining the pandemic to my past self 3!
juliia can i pls have a shoutout
Chemistry here 😏
You know... A man can take a woman's last name. If he has a especially bad name.
I NEED A TINY DOLL OF YOU! ARE YOU MAKE A YOUTOOZ?!!
I wonder how far apart in time humanity invented marriage and divorce.
YES! Two of my absolute favorite creators in the same video! LOVE IT!
Lol...."What?...What?”
Ahh!! So they got married on Julie's channel and got divorced on Ryan's channel both at the same time. This is tight. I am feeling kinda peckish.
Julie : can we afford this? Ryan : it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience
It seems upon divorce they truly split everything, subscribers included. Match made in heaven.
but it wasn't till after Queen Victoria wore a white dress that people started doing that.
Shame they got divorced right after this but I suppose that's just the world we live in. That being said loved both videos!
The first person who ever got married was a shopaholic party animal 💃🛍
2:35  S U S
That's my new favorite crossover of franchises <3 you should do one with Mirror Julie and several different Ryans!
Your ideaas aree so weirdd but it awkwardly entertains😂
Wait...is Ryan Canadian? Is he from Canadia? That explains why he's so funny.  Or is he from one of those border states where you can accidentally cross over?
You missed the very most romantic part, which is where it's a binding contract that you swear solemn oaths to adhere to, and invoking God to oversee these oaths and help you commit to them in full.
My two favorites.
No I dont want that at all hahah
Wow their subscribers count is shockingly similar, looks like they are both on the rise at the same time
Okay Julie is a baddie no cap 😍🥵😍
Wow wowow
;)
I used to cry when my dad chopped onions.I miss onions.He was a good dog
I... don't even know what the first party is supposed to be? Half of this is way too American for me.
I love this 😂❤️
Great sarcasm. Scary though.
Kinda find about their divorce before... 😅
Beautiful art!
I wish everything was this civil     Then again romantic proposals are good too
I guess I just imagined Ryan in a universe populated only with Ryans. Maybe this kid should take over: https://youtu.be/WiwZxaMXmrk
I LOVED this collaboration thing you have going on. Please do more together. You're so awesome together! ❤
This is brilliant!!
This was so funny, I'm already subscribed to both of you so, you know, awkward!
The two best YouTubers that spend all of their time talking to themselves
Came across this by seeing Ryan's "first divorce" video first. Y'all are both so charming & relatable! Love it ♥
Oh my gosh! Ryan has partnered with Julie on comedy sketches? I want to watch all of them! Produce more so that I can spend my time watching!
Finally subscribed. By the way, don't fall into that trap in real life. A small piece of advice from a trapped guy. It's presumptuous of me to give advice, but couldn't resist.  By the way, you have some uncanny talent to put a smile even in my face. Regards from India.
Oh, yeah, right -- Julie's got a boyfriend, huh -- a CANADIAN boyfriend -- suuuuure she does...
“Well, we could make a list” “Ooh, I’m list-ening”
I was hoping you two would collaborate at some point.
The crossover I didn't know I needed!
Crossover of the millennia!!!
I love a good YouTube Cinematic Universe crossover.
I love this 😂😂😂
This makes perfect sense. Although, why would you shower with clothes on? It is romantic though, for...   ...everyone?
Yeah lol
Well done
😆
Seeing this collab made my day! You two are among my favourite Youtubers and this is something I didn't know I needed. Brilliant stuff!! :)
Wow wow wow.
Hey, a female Ryan George, awesome...(I only say it that way because I knew of him first. To others for Ryan : "A male Julie Nolke, awesome") Seriously, I watched a few videos, and love em. Looking forward to seeing many more.
More Canadian Collabs🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
"people will shower us with gifts" "Oh gifts are TIGHT"
I feel they could've worked in "super easy barely an inconvenience" into the gift registry part
LOL!  at 2:40, lick whip cream off a guy with a six pack. "What?"  "What?"  Great stuff! Accurately describes the events too!
Wait till she finds out he has a son    He’s ugly too
*Oh damn, I saw the divorce video first & now seeing this BAM! #GreatShxt #KeepRockin
"Super funny videos, just like where he's talking to himself". Who even does that?
Great video 😍😍😍
Just seeing this channel for the first time thanks to Ryan's vid.  Insta-subscription! :D
This is like a condensed conversation of maybe how  generations adjusted "getting married" in western culture (the dowry concept changed too). 😆
Apropos of not this video, I think it’s time for October Julie to visit July Julie.
Ohhk now do it for an Indian wedding... Would love to see that ❤️
This is the YouTube crossover we all definitely needed.
😂
Julie Nolke, will you marry me?
Lol taking the last name is so weird. It's not the norm in Quebec so I always forget people do that
OMG THERES ANOTHER PERSON IN THE RYAN GEORGE UNIVERSE 😂😂😂
Super easy, barely an inconvinience
ah ok that is why somehow there's similarity between these two
Hey, it's a funny person collaborating with a non funny person. Now you're going to wonder who's who. lol
I wanna see the video where you guys made a portal or w/e to cross into each others worlds.
Uhh... don't know if yall are in a previous relationship but... can you guys actually be a couple? I know that's none of my business. I just think that would be a super dope thing to have happen. Great content guys. Now I'm subbed to both of ya.
Please do this together for every tradition that exists !!!
It's trending here at #4 in Aus at the moment lol
Just two of the funniest youtubers working together? NBD. 🔥👏🏻
The collab no one asked for but everyone needed
32 On trending
IMHO, Both of y'all rock I've been a subscriber of both of you for quite a while, before y'all got famous...... <3
"Well, that's not entirely accurate...But I'm into it." 😂😂😂
What a great universe we crafted here with these 2 videos
I want a TV series starring you two. You guys have such a hilarious chemistry. Great job guys! More vids please
I love you bothhh
Best collab of 2020 tight very tight.
The white dress was originally a show of wealth because only rich people could afford a dress that would be so hard to keep clean.   The idea that it had something to do with virginity came later. Before the white dress became popular people just got dressed in their best clothes. Whatever that was.  Diamond engagement rings were invented by the diamond industry.  Diamonds are practically worthless.  They are wildly overpriced as engagement rings and have no resale value.
yay, both you guys
I like the thing
So this is how millennials get married.
Love your work, Julie!
Wow, getting someone to agree to spend the rest of their life with you is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
It's so weird to see Ryan acting with another person
Came here from Ryan George. Then I spent the entire day, at work, watching your sketches. Day well spent. Laughed at every singe video so far. Keep it up I can't wait to see what's next!
Ryan brought me to this party. There better be a framed picture of you in the background in your videos, or I'm walking.
lol what?
"Is there a way to force people to get what we want?" "We could make a list." "Oh I'm listening!" I see what you did there...
Leather jacket Julie is dope
Any woman that would accede to doing this sketch with you is hot enough to ACTUALLY get married to.
Yeah, I guess that's....cute..
My two favorite youtubers in 1 video. F***en awesome
Her: So maybe we should get our parents involved.  Him: oh yeah that’s a good idea, they’re not doing anything anyways.  Her: Cuz their old?   Him: Yeah, cuz they’re old. Anyway maybe at the big party your dad could walk with you until you get to me and then he could just back away and sit down somewhere.   Her: hmm... idk I feel like thats weird.  Him: Why is that weird?   Her: I just feel like that would be sad for my dad. Like he’s losing me or... giving me away...   Him: Hm. I see what you mean. Well, maybe I could... give HIM something... in exchange?   Her: In exchange for me.   Him: Yep.  Her: Like I’m property.   Him: Uh huh. I would give him something of equal or arbitrary value in exchange for him giving you away and then he might not be sad anymore maybe.   Her: hmm... still kinda weird... but ok!
YouTube comedy royalty collaborating at last! This makes me unreasonably happy! Thanks for doing this, guys!  Now I'm going to go post the same thing on Ryan's channel.
Classic duo
julie where is that jacket from it is fire
If I subscribe to Ryan’s channel, that’ll be two Canadians I’m subscribed to. I just don’t know about that. Seems excessive.
Me: Living together for the rest of your lives. That’s seems a bit difficult.  Them: Nope, not at all. It’s barely an inconvenience.
A Julie Nolke vid featuring Ryan George is *TIGHT.*
Fucking right, eh?
Love this collab!
Woah. YouTube worlds collide.
Was getting married hard? *nah it was super simple, barely an inconvenience*
Wait.... my two favourite funny Canadian Youtubers in one video? Aaaaaargh! Why can I only like it once!?
Double standards are TIGHT!
Wow my favorite Youtubers are collbabing
IT'S HIM
Oh get a room you two.
the greatest colab of all time
Best collaboration this year!!!! >^.^< This video also made me realized I hadn’t subscribed yet! Oops!
I love the slow progression of bigger and bigger end cards to fit all of the patrons, it makes me so happy that I found your channel :)
What is this? A crossover episode?
Why is Julie wearing Fonzie's jacket? Does she think the first marriage happened in the 50s? And she even ends with an - Aaay! - so maybe she does.
The only female vlogger that i like 👍😍
Subscribing was super easy barely an inconvenience.
Please do more collabs with Ryan George. You two work extremely well together comedically.
GREAT!!
Best actor and actress on YouTube!
Wholesome.
She has potential.
The only thing i could think of is what movie is he pitching to her.
Perfect ......
HAHAHA! It’s the marriage pitch meeting😂 I’m disappointed that they didn’t have huge eyes thumbnail.
ell, this was a pretty fun one; I'm definitely going to see what else you've posted
Planning marriage, super easy, barely and inconvenience.
Wow, my two favorite skit comedians!
"Hey, this is the Wed-stonaut! We're talking about romance and making it so you can pay a monthly fee..."
Tying yourself to somebody for the rest of your life is TIGHT!
"oh its a double-standard. i get it" hahaha
Who else is here because they have eyes and fingers
please say "super easy, barely an inconvenience..." pleeeeeeeeeeeease!"  4:00 that would have been the moment... There you could have said it... aaaaaaaaaaargh... I'll never be able to fill that hole in my chest... damn...
Well that was a quick divorce. In my timeline, they even got divorced BEFORE they got married. Also, that second Ryan is looking especially good today.
The worst episode
I didn't like it....I loved it! Julie! Do the thing!
I'm disappointed not hear "super easy, barely an inconvenience"
*ORIGINS*
Her: "Why should I take your last name if you won't take mine?"  Him: "Because!"  Producer guy: "Fair enough!"  Her: "Wait... who are you?!"
Plan pranks for the wedding, throw handfulls of wedding cake at the attendees to initiate a food fight. Play an exhaustive flatulation sound during the garter belt thing.  Have all the groomsmen and bridesmaids stage a mass-pass-out so they all drop like flies.  The flower girl puts down way too much flowers, the ring bearer has candy faux-rings, the untied bouquet disintegrates mid air into loose flowers, the pianist plays a couple bars of the Star-wars' Darth-Vader-march before the song.
I'm so glad this showed up on my recommended, subscribed right away. Your channel is going to absolutely blow up, very high quality content!
Just the crossover that I didn't know that I needed.
When two of your favorite YouTuber comedians collab:  OOooOoOooOoh yeahhh!
iconic crossover
Oh no, they glossed over the finances. No wonder there's a divorce video😜
I'll be honest, I came here for Ryan, but now I think I've found a new favourite YouTuber!
Hey did you guys hear? No ovulate October!!!!!
Sounding so Canadian.
Ah, I love "first-ever" videos. I mean, first video issues are TIGHT!   I wonder if it was any sort of difficulty for Ryan to get Julie to get together for a video. I imagine she was pretty cool about it. Likely went pretty easily, barely even an inconvenience for her.
Holy FUXX. you are the only two white YouTubers that I watch,  you guys are fantastic,  I cannot believe you're in a video together.
https://youtu.be/pIsg5UcIJCQ
came from Ryan George and made sure to subscribe
I liked this video before I even watched it... Just from seeing the faces!
Congrats on the engargment u guys
put Ryan George in your title and go on trending
Now let’s create a system where one party always gets screwed if it ends.
Okay, so this explains everything!!!!!!!! I always wondered who came up with all these matrimonial and nuptial related stuffs. Also i am strongly on the sarcastic side
Marriage is so not "super easy barely an inconvenience" xD
Worlds colliding!!!
It starts fun and ends in court ... usually the man loses all gifts and HALF of what he had ...
Who is this guy with two first names?
I'll have you know Ryan George has never talked to himself
Ooo that's a sweet leather jacket
My wife was like "Watch this chick she's funny...." "I'm good..." "She's awkward and hott..." *stumbled into room a little too fast* "Well i mean i can take a little looksie... Ya she's hott" "Right?" "And actually funny" "See? I got you boo!" "Dork"
The team up we didn't know we... huh this comment seems familiar somehow...
Pandemic part 3?
Couldn't they just have been a bit more reasonable, so that I don't have to stick to that social rules? I just want to marry someone, having max. 12 close friends and family, eating out in a nice restaurant and go hiking afterwards. That's it. Why didn't they propose that!?
How many parties?  Indians: yes. And jewelry? Indians: can we get the whole store? Okay how many invitations? Indians: how many do you have? If not 7 billion I’m leaving
Love this collaboration. Two of my favorites.
Great content you two. Entertaining stuff.
Next: The First Couple To Ever Get Divorced
I don't see how this could possibly not end well.
Julie. You're amazing. This is my favourite so far. Double standard. Financial hardships. Thanks for calling everything out.
Ohh it's a double standard, oh yeah okay I get that. Lol
You know we were all waiting for the pictures in an autumnal forest. V disappointed.
🤣😅😅😂🤣🤣🤣😅😂😅🤣😅😂😂😅😂😅😅😅😅😅😂😅😂😅😅🤣😅🤣😂😂😂😂
How is this the first time I've seen you two work together???
You take my last name and I wear a ring or vice versa I ain't doin both. (I am female and really don't care).
"Oh it's a double standard!" Hits so hard.
great chemistry..genius collab partner
This video was a dream come true!
I ship it
super easy, barely an inconvenience...
This is great
Omg it really was foreshadowing when she did the germs video 🦠
This was great!! Between Julia and Eliza Schlesinger, every weird thing about Western wedding tradition is examined.
Julie. You made it.
Omg I love this 😂
YES you two need to work together more often!
Julie Nolke  You always give me a good laugh you're sexy beautiful and I wouldn't kick you outta bed for eating crackers.
Guys the ryanverse thing has another face in it this is weird
The collab we never knew we wanted
The two best people who talk to themselves on the internet talking to each other in the internet...together.
you two working together makes me so happy.  Ryan George is the perfect guy to do this with you.
I was really hoping you two would do a collab.
Your husband sent me here
Julie and Ryan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hilarious, guys!  You nailed it! Thanks for providing the laughs at a ... much needed time.
Funny. Uh, true to life funny.
Youtube made this super easy, barely an inconvenience, to find in my recommended.  Congrats Julie on meeting Ryan, and him  pitching the question!
“I love you so much. Together forever” lol
Plot twist, your subscribers were already Ryan’s subscribers. So now, nobody gets new subs
Me, 5 minutes ago: "A Ryan's video with o non-Ryan person? She can't be THAT funny" Me, now: "Ok, she's THAT funny". Subscribed!
Ryan is why I came.. He's the best what can I say..  But your  the videos  made me subscribe keep it up
Collabing with the Ryan Cinematic Universe was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I think it is finally time for “Explaining the Pandamic to my Past-Self Part 3“!
Julie: For richer or poorer? Ryan: Yeah, I'm gonna need you to get alllll the way off my back on that. Julie: Okay, let me get off of that thing.
This was the best. Do more collabs. I sent this to everyone.
Watching this video was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I never understood why people change their names. It’s Taboo here in the Middle East to change your family name.
Came here because of Ryan and subscribed because the space Ryan said so. On a side note a fun fact it was Queen Victoria who made weddings wear white dress for weddings. It was basically to show  that I am rich. White was hard to not only keep clean and make so a white dress was expensive. So women you have the Queen of England to thank it doesn't mean purity. The purity part of white came from white bedsheets in nobles again because it shows wealth but also when the bride has her wedding night and sex happened well proof of her virginity would show up on the sheets. Now you know
Oh.. It's a double standard...I get it.
😅😅😅 "I guess that's cute"  "in front of all of your blood relatives"
Holy shit theyre in the same place I can officially die now I've seen all I ever need to see
I need to have you as a guest on my show!
WOWOWOWOW.  Getting married is super easy barely an inconvenience
"Oh! Oh, it's a double standard, I get it now." xD
Wow... this really, really worked lol.
Raising awareness for International Awareness Day IAD
I know this is all a joke but they did actually used to burn wives so they could bury them next to their husbands.
This was amazing and hilarioud!
and people get married why?
BEST CROSSOVER EVER!♥♥♥
Its kinda flat tbh
Lool😂😂😂
julia and ryan,i was having the worst day,thank you. i failed my test and woke up late,and my anxiety been shit thx u
She's truly beautiful
Honestly, one of the best parts is the cordial Canadian communication. The screaming in-laws and lack of disrespect is clearly an American tradition that was added later
MY TWO FAVE PEOPLE IN ONE VID? FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD IN 20W0
"Barely an inconvenience"
Ahh the moment 😂😂
Next up: Julie in a Chevy commercial featuring Zebra Corner.
Julie: You should totally subscribe to this guy talking to himself.  Someone: Talking to himself? How's that gonna entertain me?  Ryan: Actually, it'll be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI
The greatest crossover in the history of crossovers!
I'm never getting married. It's pointless.
omg this is too funny!!
Everyone, you can help by using your computer to find cures for the COVID virus! 	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU4qOebhkfs
My two fav YouTubers together!
Yea ! He's the best !!! .... Sorry ?
I discover both of your channels this year and now I can't believe you guys are collaborating! I loved it! I am already shipping this! Hahahaha
Lol love this. How I feel about the weird marriage traditions.
Julie, wish you were my wife you are so gorgeous and funny🙂👍♥️🙂
So TRUE!!
1:59 I quit my work with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I actually managed to keep a straight face until "autumnal forest".......these skits and acting are staying top shelf....
Found you because of Ryan and stayed for you  So I am totally subscribing
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
If woman doesnt take name it's not marriage
This is in an imaginary world where marriage was even a choice to the women. 😂
Wait ... didn't you skip The First Couple To Ever Have A Baby? How the heck did THAT get to be a thing?!?
She is gorgeous and hot personality
Never thought of it before but they’d be so cute
“You just glossed over...” Hahahaha
Honestly I’m just glad to see that Ryan actually knows people in real life.
joylavita.com
It's non-negotional.  I'm sorry to tell ya!
Brilliant🙂♥️👍
*I pray who ever reads this becomes successful , And we can all arise.*
*Literally the 1% people who reading. May your family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Live more than 100 year with good health...# 💖*
*1.5% people who are reading this, may God bless you ...🧡*
*No one talking about how beautiful she looks.*
"If I die I don't have to hang out with your corps"      "No, I wouldn't do that."  fucking hilarious
Oh fuck yeah. Two of my favourite youtube creators collabing
These guys seem perfect together
My 2 favourite youtubers both talk to themselves. I have to think about this a lot I guess. You are both amazing, love you both.
You r very ........
Guys I’m tired of this back and forth.. Ryan told me to come here now I have to go back? Really!
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
😴 Lame!
"I'm LISTning" 😂
It’s 6:30 am and here I am thinking this was gonna be educational but nope....
Marriage Pitch Meeting
Ryan George asked me to come here. It was super easy, barely an inconvenience
I was today year's old when I found out Ryan George is Canadian
This is just a copy of https://yubo.live/en?referral=33TJL9QJU&source=whoadd
WAIT THIS IS A JULIE NOLKE VIDEO?
I’m just at the beginning but I’m hoping to see: ***”We have to think about others on our special day. Let’s make a choice we love so that others can make our wedding about them so they can get upset because they don’t like the choice that means something to us!!”***
This is golden writing
Nah, actually a capitalist scam by a diamond selling company. Congrats on trending in Canada though.
As a pastor, I am offended no role was given for our kind in this thing ;-)
0:58 I quit my work thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Most awesome cross over of 2020..... I was a Ryan fan.... And in this lock down I found Julie talking to herself and got super hooked..... And binged every video.... This crossover was super epic.... Cheers guys....
Government: So, to make this legally binding you need to consummate the marriage... You heard me.
This is amazing. I love Ryan george. It’s like the avengers of YouTube sketch comedy
Yay! I love both of y'all. This is the perfect collab! 😎
That moment when two of your fav you tubers do a collar. Great work
How short are you? I thought you'd be as tall as him
Great couple! 👍🏻 you guys should collab more until you fall in love and go out together!
This is like the time where Jimmy Neutron and Fairly OddParents did the crossover episodes.
Man, Ryan's costumes are getting real elaborate, doesn't even look like there's two of him any more.
I am confused . Found this on trending is this a comedy channel? It was funny.
Love it good collabloration. Lol lot of parties
I like the soccer goal
Barely an inconvenience!!!!
I'm not buying her as a straight woman.
I dont know if I'm comfortable watching Ryan with a different human .
Pefect match. This is awesome. Keep it up :D
Thank You for this piece of high quality content! The collab we needed!
as accurate as your description was for Ryans videos I still feel like it was an over simplification LMAO
My wife had a party with that was penis themed. I stayed in with my friends PlayStation, Nintendo, and Sega. Then I had to hire random guys in a Wal-Mart parking lot to be my groomsman and best man... Moral to the story is.. Make sure you have handhelds to be your groomsman and best man because they're easier to carry, and hide so when they day comes pull them out of your pocket at the last minute so your wife can't disagree... Mine didn't agree.. True story!!!
Getting married for the first time is TIGHT😁
Ryan George  and Julie Nolke  !!!!!  OMG !
Most ambitious crossover since The Avengers is TIGHT!
uau
That rich and poor part had me laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂this is the collab we never knew we needed
Does he know about the mole?
I'm skeptical that this is historically accurate. 🤔
Ryan sent me
Oh my God, you're unreal ^^ Great collab!
Wow... Their marriage lasted only for an hour!!!

Julie julie julie. That was way too hight quality content 😂💯
The First Couple To Ever Get Married (ft. Ryan George) - October 1, 2020 The First Couple To Ever Get Divorced (ft. Julie Nolke) - October 1,  2020 Huh, short marriage.
Ryan told me to subscribe, because you talk to yourself.  So... I slapped liked and subscribed.
3:49 *"Together, Forever."*  I was sort of.... kind of.... expecting to hear, "That's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience", from the groom on this one, knowing how easily he makes things happen on screen, in alternate realities and all.. but alright. This will do fine.  ;)
You two need to do much more of this!
Trump just tested positive.  #shouldadrankbleach 🍊🍕💩
I ship it
"Ohh its a double standard, OK I get it thats fine :)"
Love it, this was like the "Marriage concept pitch meeting"
I hope Julie’s ready for the barrage of “super easy, barely an inconvenience” comments on all her videos
No way, they did a collab?!
Do we get to see drunk the Drunk Ryan in the mirror? XD
"I might lick whipped cream off a guy with a six-pack." "Actually, that's just his face photoshopped over a picture of someone else's body." *shatter* Jim:  "Sorry, I keep having trouble with the last wall.  For some reason, the fourth wall keeps shattering!"
"Sounds a little shady but I'm in to it" would also be a great line for "first couple who experimented in the bedroom", and also "first couple to invent a parasol".
So like the entire joke of these videos are the actors basically take a normal everyday thing we don’t think about and satirically point out the weirdness of it by acting out an exaggerated sketch of how it might have first occurred.   I mention this because as a South Asian I’ve never been to a Westernised wedding before, and ALL of this sounds weird and I have no reference for the normality. 😅  Like using your teeth to pull the garters off from under the dress in-front of everyone what
The person setting up the soccer net in the background and then the people playing soccer really makes this video
"Oh I get it it's a double standard that's fine" XD
Future prediction 1. Ryan Reynolds could appear in Deadpool 3 pitch meeting. 2. Ryan Reynolds could also appear in Julie Nolke.. Because CANADA.
Actually the white dress has nothing to do with virginity, and not only do many cultures not wear white dresses, it wasn't even popular until Queen Victoria did it.
Wow congrats on trending?
I was waiting for this collaboration! My two favorite YouTubers.
This video is tight
Marriage the Pitch meeting.
These two were made for each other. Maybe she can go on Screenrant with Ryan and destroy my beloved movies as well.
My two favourite youtube comedians in one collab. I love it!
Ryan brought me here, and I must say, I've subscribed to someone new :3
Are you saying that because you don’t want to go shopping with me? LOL
This is everything I always wanted and I'm only being slightly hyperbolic
So this one is trending and the other isn't?
Omg 2 of my faves come together
Can we all just agree to quit doing the garter thing? It’s so strange and kinda gross.
This collab needs to happen more.
You two have outstanding comedic chemistry.
This is nothing more then a masterpiece
Hi I'm Brian I came over from Ryan George's channel. I never heard of you until now but you have a great channel here! I liked, subscribed and now commenting. Hope you don't mind I did not do it in the recommended order
Julie Nolke and Ryan George teaming up kinda makes up for the rest of the year
Dangit! I watched the divorce one first... Now I know things don't work out for these two.. Sad.
Let’s get this from #12 on trending to #1 on trending
One and only thing I was expecting that wasn’t included was him having a ring to show to everyone he is taken.
WhAT MAkeS YoU ThINk tHE FiRst PeOplE To GeT MaRrIED WErEnt gAy??
Ryan can make me click on anything. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
My two favorite YouTube peeps in the same video (twice!). 2020 is looking up from where I'm standing.
I'm glad you two collaborated on this! I've been following Ryan's content for awhile, and these two videos were my first exposure to Julie. I've been watching your videos all day and I'm totally hooked!
LITERALLY THE BEST COLLAB EVER
Amazing
ATTENTION ALL AMERICANS NOV.03.20 GET OUT AND VOTE!
I was brought here thanks to the new Ryan George video that you just mentioned at the end of this video. It was super easy barely an inconvenience. Both of these videos are tight.
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double 15 second no skip ads .
The people who didn't come from tiktok are worthy of liking this 💯
💞If you are reading this comment:💞BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💞💫✨✨💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
The collab I didn't know I absolutely needed
Fuckin fantastic.
This just makes “normal” human occasions don’t seem normal lol.
hahaha this is awesome. Love Ryan's stuff too, was so excited to see a collab with you two!!! do more!! These are amazing! :)
I knew this collab was coming and yet I'm really happy that it happened
Awesome work!  Will there be a quarantine time travel part 3? I love those soooooo much!
I didn't realize this wasn't his channel until you told me. Huh.
#12 on trending!!!
R:"So you have new crossover script for me that doesn't involve you talking to yourself?" R:"Yes Sir I do" R:"Oh actually talking to the opposite gender is TIGHT 😃👀😏" R:"Yeah yeah yeah"
Didn't know Ryan was Canadian.

Guys, I'm leaning English and Spanish. I've been posting on my instagram stories tips about my journey learning 2 languages at the same time. Started learning English in February and Spanish in July. I can help you to do the same. You don't need money to learn a new language. Could you please give me a note for my English on my instagram?? @jf_ribeiro99 @jf_ribeiro99 @jf_ribeiro99
I like your jacket!
Oooooh ho ho ho! This is a winning combo for suuuure! ❤️
I love you guys!!
Ahhh. You made it all make so much more sense when you put it that way!
Ryan George brought me here, and I've already watched nearly 45 minutes from this channel alone. Being subscribed to both of these channels could really cause a problem for my work productivity.
So where do you guys think this falls in the RGCU timeline??
Pitch Meeting: The Wedding
At least he wasn't marrying himself, that would be weird
Well these two should be a couple
Ryan George fans commenting on this video: (non-stop Ryan George catchphrases)  Julie: Oh saying someone's catchphrases on someone else's videos is TIGHT!!!!
Getting married is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I have a feeling this is going to end in divorce. Jus a feeling
You look badass in that leather jacket
If only people had this informative of a conversation before they got married, there would be a lot less divorces :P
ryan ryans
I'm confused at the end, so did ya really get engaged or not....🤣🤣🤣 Jk
Julie; Found you through Ryan George.  Checked out some of your other pieces, and I laughed at them.  Thumbs up, I'll subscribe.  Like the quarantine vids.  Mirror, mirror is a funny idea.  Keep up the good work!
My two favorite people in the world!
OMG this is the collaboration that I have been waiting for all my life!

Kinda creeps me out they talk the same.
"Well how do they know you're mine?" "There's no need for that."
Julie now has more Subscribers than Ryan
Fun game to play after you've watched that clip. Watch it again, but try picturing Julie and Ryan as Rachel and Chandler, from Friends. Their voices and maneurism sometimes fit 100%
'Whoever Likes This Will One Day Be A Billionaire ''Good Luck'' 🍀
LOL 🤣
I always wondered how that shoe-tying tradition started.
Story of my life
getting only gifts you want is tight.
Super easy bearly and inconvence
I mean if there was ever a better YouTube couple I don't know of it. Who says differences make a good couple. Marrying your you tube twin seems perfectly fine, barely any inconvenience. What could go wrong.
https://youtu.be/2aG6lCCk8HE
Very clever !
How does she only have 610k subscribers??? She's been in the top trending so many times already.
Oh wow, Ryan got on Trending!?! That was Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience.
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄.......🙄
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads
My favorite Nigerian custom is they actually shower the newly weds with monetary bills. Awesome.
so much hilarious acting talent in one video
I want my last name back. I love my husband but I want my last name back!!! Weird how I had to explain I still love my husband even though I don’t want his last name. That’s the dilemma we are faced with when we decide to get married.
Y’all both really do be talking to yourselves 😂
This is really  great  content
Yay! My two favorite quarantine YouTubers!!
Awesome!
The collab we didn’t know we needed!
My two favorites! Perfect collab!
"We could make a list." "Oh, I'm listening." Brilliant.
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .   The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .
Woah! She needs to get waaaay off his back
https://youtu.be/_FlUFsmbOqY
This NEEDS to happen more often. I'm starting to see double on Ryan's channel
They were already on the fast track to divorce
All marriage proposals should be like this..Divorce rates would go wayyyy down  😂😂😂
Intelligent comedy!!
Thanks Ryan
1:57 I stopped my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Ryan sent me over... subscribed
How will they know your mine.  No need for that 😂
The crossover we've all been waiting for!
Collaborations between Julie and Ryan are tight!
My you tube life is complete when my 2 favorite you tubers get together to make hilarious videos! Rock on, guys!
2 favourite youtubers together at last.
Ryan George is surprisingly hot in a black leather jacket.
Your an amazing actress miss, hope Hollywood doesn’t steal you and ruin you.
It's so romantic. They both die together in the same bed, holding hands, 3 weeks later from not wearing a mask..
Almost missed this one by seeing the Divorced video first - thanks to YouTube placing this at the top of the video list so I get to see them in the proper order!  Oh and I subscribed to this channel now because this was hysterical :-).
Uh... Ryan forced me to come here but now I kinda want to stay! Got any choc-chip cookies?
Marriage is a Joke basically
When two of your favorite youtubers collab unexpectedly, "wait a minute, its not my birthday..."
I can die now. I've seen them both in the same video.
Julie and Ryan have almost the exact same subscriber counts at the time of writing this lol.
You guys are my 2 favorite sketch comedy channels on YouTube and did 2 videos together in one day. PERFECT.
This collab was necessary
And here I thought you guys have been stealing each other’s ideas...you’ve actually been COLLABORATING! Sweet!
I feel like a YouTube fool. When I 'discovered' Ryan George 3 months ago, I thought he was so good that I sent him a message telling him about Julie Nolke, that he 'had' to check her out. Now I see they know each other long enough to make a video together. That's what being 75 and 'out of it' gets you. Faux pas everyday... EDIT: In fact, this very comment is probably a faux pas also.. (and maybe this edit too.) Help!
This was great and am glad to subscribe to your channel. Can't wait to see you other videos!
This has been a collaboration I've wanted to see for so long!
Prenup anyone?
I want tracksuits now
The best engagement ever
Oh collabs are tight!  Am I...am I the first one...?
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this,God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day.💜 (my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks .
Good job, u2!
Getting married is....TIGHT!!
It's insane how you're only separated by 3k subscribers.
So happy to have you both in my life. Just stay healthy.
My two favorite YouTube people finally together.  My life is now complete!!!
Congratulations you two crazy kids!
Ok
❤️it! Headed over to R George now! (Will subscribe)
I want to see a collaboration where you both play two parts.
No problem, barely an inconvenience .
That was fantastic! I'm so glad you guys made this colab!
I always thought these two would be perfect for each other aka crossover aka super hero team up
L    M     A.     O
The ultimate crossover
More...of...this, Excellent!!
As someone who just got engaged, this video is hitting different ahaha
We could make a LIST, Oh I'm LISTening.
"So, what if we change our mind? Is that going to be a problem?" "Nope, super easy, barely an inconvenience."
Who told you what happened when I proposed to my wife?
"But how do they know you're mine?" "Oh there's no need for that."
Proposal was super easy, barely an inconvenience
"Are you thinking badges? Matching tracksuits?" I WISH I DID BOTH
More of you two. It is god damn hilarious
The one which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty has come in the flesh to save mankind. For in him, who was from the beginning, was life, and that life was the light of men. He is that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own and his own people received him not. Therefore, the gates of mercy and grace and have been extended to all, as many as would receive him, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of GOD.   The eternal almighty God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and in truth. He begat a Son, and called him by his own name, JESUS. For he came in the flesh and into the world to save those them that are lost.   The whole world is covered in gross darkness and it is void of life, truth, righteousness, and godliness. The world is filled with violence, lust, covetousness, idolatry, sorcery, lies, thefts, murders, envyings, revellings, perverseness, and every abomination in the sight of the living God.   But God, rich in mercy, sent his only begotten Son into the world and he willingly gave his life, to bleed and to die on a cross for the sins of the world. For the wages of sin is DEATH and the unrighteous and the wicked shall be turned into HELL. For sin and death spread to all by one man, by whom the whole world came, Adam, even so shall righteousness and life come to as many as will receive the Prince of Life, Jesus Christ. Now, the saints of the Lord Jesus Christ, who have come to that true light which was from the very beginning, have been washed clean and have made their garments spotless by the blood of the holy lamb of God that was slain for the sins of the world. Moreover, they have received the Spirit of Jesus Christ, whereby they live holy and righteous abstaining from every appearance of evil and now have the same Spirit dwelling in them that quickened the mortal body of Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior. For it was not possible that death and the grave should keep the Lord Jesus Christ, for death is reserved for the wicked and he was without sin. Therefore, God raised up his Son from the grave on the third day of his burial and seated him at his own right hand, all power in heaven and in earth given unto the Son of God. And that he should rule ALL the nations with a rod of iron and return in due time with his holy saints to take vengeance on all they that know not God and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ.   Today is the day of salvation and I’m sent of God to preach the way of salvation to sinners. The false gospel of “Accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior” never made you a saint because it was a lie taught to you by the a world who knows not the way, the truth, and the life. But the gospel which I preach, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, is the POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION TO EVERYONE THAT BELIEVETH, TO THE JEW FIRST AND ALSO TO THE GREEK.  I tell you all, REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERYONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS AND YE SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he CANNOT enter into the kingdom of God.   Take heed, fear God, and do his commands, for this is the whole duty of man. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that  they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates and into the that holy city.
Great video, Julie!
Extreme Canadian accent displayed in the first 10 seconds Julie...
Soooo true about the last name thing 🤣

Normie comedy... if you laughed at this you're a normie and you will always be one smh.

PepeLaugh
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
More! Produce more collaborations! Oh, by the way, you guys are getting divorced soon.
OMG two of my fav YouTubers collaborating??? Yes!!!!!
TWO OF MY FAVORITE CONTENT PROVIDERS!  Awesome!!
"OH, so it's a double standard. Got it. I'm in." This. This is top-tier.
I'll be honest, I did _not_ see this collab coming!
Ok, straight up. You guys could be a YUUUGE comedy duo. Here's hoping for more quality collaborationios.
My didk     What was i saying here
He definitely absolutely doesn't want to go shopping for hours just to find that one dress. 🤣  Edit: Oh, there's a sequel!
Can confirm that Ryan George indeed has legs.
2:59 this is reflected in the other video where the girl gets half the guys stuff, but keeps all hers.
I love this collab!! Here from Ryan George's channel, sorry to say I've never seen any of Julie's videos until now but I now have the urge to go watch tons of her videos!
Hello I`am from the Ryanverse, I write this comment just to tell you. Ryan doesn`t talk to himself, these are multiple person, thought you should know that! Good collab!
Dreamcouple yay :) :) how cool is that?! Please be the first couple ever to have kids or a dog at least ::))))
Kinda looks like a classic ex vine people video so I just clicked on it to give it a dislike 😘
Seeing Julie and Ryan together is my favourite crossover
Julie Nolke, where did you get that leather jacket in the video? I've been looking for one like that!
You better treat her right Ryan or 602K people are going to be after your ass.
Finally realized who Julie reminds me of... Bob Newhart.
Honestly thought my eyes were unable to focus properly for a second and I was seeing 2 different video thumbnails merged together.
Is anyone gonna talk about how Ryan and Julie are extremely close in subs? I keep checking and they both keep going up and I feel a competition going on.
I saw both notis go off
A studio needs to throw money at both of them ASAP! Best 2 creators on the internet
Wonder what mirror Julie thinks about Ryan
this video looks like it was fun to make, also maybe Super Easy, Barely an inconvenience.
I freakin loved this you guys .
Legendary collaborations are tight!
boring, boring, boring
Ryan really let his hair grow!
First Presidential Dedate 2020: Joe Biden vs Donald J Trump | JF https://youtu.be/A6pLhFze9Yg
On the trending page!!! Go Julie!! - a proud fellow canadian
The garter bit at receptions has always been super weird. Glad someone else called it out.
I love the simultaneous uploads
this happened....(really did not expect  it)
This was Really good
How could this work?! There’s only one Ryan clone in this, bet they’ll get a divorce
my two favorite Canadians in totally the same video omg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae8p0-LtwGw
lolololololol  awesome
Getting married is TIGHT!
I DEMAND MIRROR JULIE AND PRODUCER RYAN SKIT!!!!
Omg! It's Ryan!
My two favorite YouTube comedians!!!
People wore brown for wedding actually... until very recently in history.
YES! FINALLY!!
- "...I like all the man to wear ties around their heads" - "That doesn't make any sense" - "I'm gonna need you to get way of my back on this"
#7 on trending letsss goooooooooooo
Best collab ever
Please don’t marry Ryan George! I’ve been saving myself for him
"I'm gonna wear all white... Well its virginal" Says the girl dressed all in black!
Came from Ryan's video, loved them both!!
"I guess that's...cute" lol
Too much talking. Put some more action into your videos. Like a dead bird drops from the sky or something.
Sounds "exactly" like when I asked my wife to marry me. Funny funny video!!
Just came from Ryan's channel. I feel like I should of watched this first. It kinda feels like quite a reversal. Oh well. I'll just treat this like a prequel event.😊
THE PERFECT COUPLE
And the next morning, she put on 120 pounds, threw away her thongs in favour of granny panties and started having headaches every night.  ... and Ryan died of regret.  ...Then she moved to the caribbean with his half of the life insurance.  Both finally found happiness.
I needed 1 Sub
I love this. Your videos are so similar, and you mesh soo well.
In Ancient Greece it was customary to throw an apple at someone for marriage.
Omg did you just crash the whole concept of weddings 🤣🤣🤣
Weird that you two have the same views on these  vids and the same number of subscribers.
Does this mean hes married?  jJust wondering
WOWOWOW
😍😍😍
man, this marriage didn't last long!
2 OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS!!!!!
Honest Review: It was relatable and kinda funny = enjoyable , but @ 4:05 and on , my Lord - Julie is so Hot!! Sorry / not Sorry Julie. No need to worry , I live in the U.S. and yet again, Canada has used common sense and gave the big --- "Nah , we good...stay down there" To us fools below your border.
It’s so weird to see how these videos are awkward in a different way than Ryan George’s
This is not clickbait lol, what u think https://youtu.be/Z2aTEyFH34o
Imagine making funny videos talking to yourself 😂. I'm guessing you both find it super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Double-standards are TIGHT! And so is this colab.
BRUH the first one get married is in JESUS days bro
He doesn't talk to himself he talks to people who look just like him he has a lot of body doubles.
Well done.
The coolant I didn’t know I needed until I saw it on my feed. Best crossover ever!
THE CROSSOVER WE NEVER KNEW WE NEEDED. THE RYAN UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING
This is a testimony of a man who got my ex back in three days. I am not happy, I contacted this man last after I have met 3 different spell casters who did not help me. My ex Pickford broke up with me, months have passed and he still tells me he misses me but doesn't want to come together with me. I miss him too and I want us back together. I came online to find spell casters and when I contacted Doctor Murugu he brought my ex back to me in three days. I was very happy the next day when my ex called me to tell me once more he misses me and the third day he told me we should get back together.  I am very happy writing this testimony to him and I want everyone to contact him. He will help you. and his direct contact him at Email him at (dr.makinidrmurugu@gmail.com) OR (dr.makinidrmurugu@yahoo.com) WhatsApp/call  +90 538 069 4285
Hm. Between both channels, I'm starting to suspect that Canadians all talk to themselves.
Who knew that Julie was so good at playing a guy
Yea!!!  This is what I have been hoping and waiting for!!! Loved it!!
Marriage? Super easy, barely an inconvenience!
now i want a Ryan talking to the mirror and Julie´s Pitch Meeting
Perfection
Great to see you working together.
Hahahah
soo.. what about shipwrecks? like in the Tom Hanks movie
TBH, you guys should do more stuff together, you have nice vibe between :)
Huh
I am already subscribed to these two goofs! I'm so glad they collabed!
They know he is hers because they have kids....silly millennials.
His universe extends
OMG, IT'S A JULIE AND RYAN COLLAB!!! I have never clicked on a thumbnail this fast in my life!
Collaboration between Ryan and Julie? My world is complete. Go Canada 🇨🇦!
Ryan gang here. So glad this happened so I could find your channel! Definitely subscribed!
Yess!!! Best co-lab ever!
Make a whole channel for a collab.
This is the start of the marriage and then Ryan’s video is the end of it
Doing a collab is super easy, barely an inconvenience
When I saw the thumbnail I was like "YES!!!" *POWER COUPLE*
Brilliant! Thanks.
Now I see why you guys got divorced 😂💔
When you two favorite youtubers get married. Wow Wow Wow
Her: This whole getting married thing sounds super elaborate and complicated.  Ryan: Actually it's super easy, barely an inconvenience!
"Hey, wanna add, a law that says we steal each other's parents?" "Steal each other's parents?" "Yeah, see we forcibly adopt each other's families by law, like a weird student exchange program." "Won't that be kind of awkward for, I don't know...everyone?" "Nah, barely an inconvenience." "Well alright then!" "Hey, while we're at it, how 'bout we take EACH OTHER'S last names, so we belong to each other? Sure, there might be a little extra paperwork, but-" "Yeah, nope, you lost me." "Well, dangit!"
When your two best youtubers collab BEST CROSSOVER EVER
Autumnal forrests are tight
I've binged both of your channels during the pandemic. This is the ultimate collab :)
Oh my god I've never seen Ryan with other actors I thought he lived in like a bubble made of green screens in outer space
I love your Channel and his pitch meeting videos.  Love the rapid fire between you two. Also y’all would make an adorable real life couple just sayin.
Marvel: "Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover ever"  Julie & Ryan: "Hold our Poutine"(Sorry to my non-Canadian friends, it's a Canadian thing)
OMG Julie and Ryan are engaged????? Picking a wedding dress should be super easy, barely an inconvenience!
For richer, for poorer...whatever richer is. Oh, I think I herd about it in a pitch meeting once.
Jesus is coming soon! Repent and turn to God for the kingdom of heaven is near! Jesus came to this earth to remove our sins and become our perfect high priest. He was hated by the world become he is not of the world. He was whipped and killed carrying our sins and rose on the third day so that we can raise with him. Time is short repent and put your faith in Jesus.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates✌️
Super easy, barely an inconvenience 😂😂😂
Genuinely confused about if you two are actually married or just two YouTubers doing a collab
OMG I LOVE HIS TIKTOK CONTENT!!! His sense of humour and comedic delivery is absolutely next level
I saw this coming. Not the whole marriage thing. No way. Nuh-uh. Nopers. Never that. Ever. Just you two. Together. As a couple. But,... um... not as a couple couple. Wait. That'd be a couple of couples. Which you could do. But, didn't. Which is irrelevant. Oh dear. Eh... nice work.  (runs away)
This is the one crossover we didn't know we needed. Awesome!
My two favorite youtubers in the same video. This is good, this is good.
"Should we get divorced?"  "That'll be super easy. Barely an inconvenience!"
These videos just get better and better!  Such great acting!  Keep the great laughs coming!
This pairing is funny because they showed both your guys’ videos at a bar testing/movie I went to lol
wow two of my favorite people
That’s it. I ship it. Y’all have to be a thing. Would be the best youtube couple
So Julie is in the Ryanuniverse? Noice!
I love Julies channel, and I love Ryan’s pitch meetings. So, I LOVED THIS
'That's the lady from that pandemic video' 'She is' 'Wow wow wow, wow' 'Why the sudden collaboration though?'  'So we both gain subscribers' 'Oh subscribing is TIGHT I'ma do it right now!'
*Well this marriage doesn’t end well...*
It has finally happened!
Liarssss https://youtu.be/6pCxt59MEl0
I like how Canadian this skit is: everyone is calm and polite.
2:40   Whoa! Where did that woman in the background go?! 2:52  Whoa! That woman in the background turned into a man! 3:53  Whoa! That woman in the background who turned into a man has multiplied!
Hey, that’s ryan!
Oh my god Ryan is tall
Julie, you are really an original and creative thinker. This was a lot of fun to watch, and the related video on Ryan’s channel was also.
printmaker phocine
Genious as usual 😅
Best collab ever XD!!
The modern world has removed all meaning from our traditions. Marriage is a permanent bond forged by God.
There are so many things to comment on in this glorious video but what to choose?! It was like a Pitch meeting but for a wedding!  Also, the "for richer or poorer" bit was hilarious!
That's so strange he talks to himself, I mean who does that, right?!
"Infinity War Is The Most Ambitious Crossover Event In History"
Julie : But wont it be hard to get rid of the other Ryan? Ryan 1 :  Actually it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience. Julie : oh really? Ryan 1 : Yeah, I’ll send him over to your identical friend Julie’s house while we make this video.
This is the collab that's making 2020 all worth it.
This collab just made the year way better!!
Why is there a person without a beard in this video?
that was a quick relationship
“It’s a fair trade, you get a ring, I get to assimilate you into my bloodline!” -Ryan George, the inventor of marriage.
Came here from Ryan’s channel! Quality content, keep it up x)
This was absolutely brilliant!
#12 ON TRENDING so happy for you Julie 🎉💕🎊
almost the same amount of subs maybe they were meant for each other
This is a verbal thumbs up in addition to the actual thumbs up.
HEEEY EVERYONE🤗 my fiancé and I vlog our lives if you wanna check us out🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I've watched the divorce one first and then this one, like everyone else.
You two are literally the only comedian I follow on YouTube, love this 😂
Two of my favorite YouTubers that makes me laugh👏👏👏😄😄😄
Omfg, this was way funnier than i expected. Subbed!
Hey um, will you spend the rest of your life with me?  You sun of a gun, I’m in.
I wish all proposals can be like this one...
Holy wow. My two favorite YouTube people in the same video! I never thought this would happen!!! I love this.
I commented my desire for a Julie-Ryan collab a while ago and got a heart. So glad this has happened! That said, it's really disconcerting seeing Ryan in the company of people who aren't Ryan.
Wow, wow, wow...Wow! 🤗👍 Welcome to the #RyanGeorgeMultiVerse. We have Two whole people now! 🤣😂🤣
is he your twin brother? he's following your "steps" flawlessly
Ryan: Won't it be a lot of work to throw all of these parties? Julie: Oh no it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I'VE BEEN IN CLASS NONSTOP SINCE THE NOTIFICATIONS HIT AND NOW I AM SO READY FOR THIS
Ryan George sent me and I’m here to stay.
0:51 "Oh, I'm _list_ ening." Please tell me you did that on purpose.
Just came here from you with Ryan George, watched your stuff... aaaand Subscribed.
This feels like this is probably exactly how it happened, like we just got to travel in time and witness the start of some truly horrible traditions.
WOW, I didn't know I wanted this. But YES!
So is it hard to find someone to marry? No it is not, it's barely an inconvenience!
The streams have crossed
Roflol makes Marriage look retarded.
"I'm going to need you to get ALLLL the way off my back about this many years from now..."
I like how he posted “The first couple to get divorced” and she posted “the first couple to get married” at the same time
*Spoiler*      They gonna divorce (probably already divorced depending on where you coming from)
I don't get what the third party is. One is the bachelor(ette) party, one is the wedding itself and the last one is what?
awesome collab!
*OPEN BAR* during all of this...
Finding Julie and Ryan is the one good thing in 2020
This is the collab I've been waiting for! 😍
Huh. I'm just impressed that they managed to get married, have kids and get divorced within an hour or two.
errr, um...'scuse please? Julie Nolke: I loves you. You is funny, you is charming, you is smart! (I hope you've seen the movie, otherwise "I is...coming off like a fool! haha.) Question: I typed in Ryan George and several came up. The only one that looks as though it may be his is totally private! So there's that.
Julie: "So we're gonna do this forever?" Ryan: "Well, for the rest of our lives..." Super easy, barely an inconvenience!
So Julie makes videos talking to her self and Ryan makes videos talking to himself...do their alternate personalities get married too?  This is a major plot hole.
Who are these 2000 people who aren't subscribers of both your channels???
This must be the first time ever I see Ryan from head to toe.
Big fan of the crossover! You earned a subscriber. Love Mirror Julie, she's real funny. The pandemic time-travel vids were the best!
Marriage has just become 10X weirder.
Came from Ryan George’s channel
Wow, two of the most amazing people who are known to talk to themselves a lot - actually talking TO EACH OTHER! Great job, guys!
I love how Ryan and Julie have almost the exact same amount of subscribers   And that is *not* super easy and very much an inconvenience!!
You know, spotting Ryan's fans is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Wow....Good shit lmaooo
I've been waiting for this collab forever!
why would the husband growing uznfer the dress even be a thing
They’re like the same person
The internet is clearly starting to fold in on itself. Julie AND Ryan in the same video. This can't be good.
Please marry for real! The world would be perfect.
"Oh it's a double standard" So fucking accurate and hilarious. Love your content.
I've been waiting for this collab to happen for a while now :)
Hes leaking into other channels. The Coryanvirus is spreading!
605k VS 607k followers, exciting.
Ok I see Ryan, I see Julie... but where’s Other Ryan? Usually he’s in one of these videos.
Yay! A collab from my two favorite comedy youtubers!
1:38 "That's non negotiable.  I don't know what to tell you" LMAO
This collab is beautiful.
I guess these videos are canon to your channel and not Ryan's since there are people in them who aren't him.  Either way this is the collab I didn't know I needed!
You and Ryan have both 605.000 subscribers!  :-o
WOW.  That was amazing.  So great to see the two of you working on a project together!!!!
That was fun.
There's actual people in Ryanverse now! Whoops! Whoopsie!
What was your wedding like Julie?
This vieo was super easy, bareley and inconvenience, to watch.
Literally my two favorite people in the same place. I can only take so much happiness at one, are you trying to kill me?
I watched these the wrong way 😂
I just watched these videos in the wrong order lol.
You’re so freaking amazing 🤩
ScreenRant: 10 ways Julie Nolke was already secretly part of the Ryanverse!
This is brilliant
- So you got a Julie for me? - Yes sir, I do!
What is this a crossover episode?
The funny thing is they still missed a party. The rehearsal dinner. The party celebrating the bride and groom and the people who had to put up with the bride and groom (but mostly just the bride and groom).
"Oh, it's a double standard. Got it." LOL! I loved that bit. And seriously, you and Ryan are basically two of the comedians that I really wanted a collaboration video(s) of because you two are both so funny and similar in style! LOVE IT!
At least in Puerto Rico the last name of a married woman is not changed to that of the couple, the son inherits the 2 last names or surname first the father's first last name and second the mother's first last name. Example Liam Smith Johnson.( I am proud I can maintain the both last names)
This collab is TIGHT
Oh God, you both just made me so happy. Two of my favorite people taking up how insane marriage is. I hope this wasn't a one time thing. I would love to see more
Ok kinda throw a wrench in the ryanverse having everyone look like ryan?!
Julie Nolke: "I'll see you here next week." Me: "You might rabbit. You might."
0:50 "We could make a list" "OH I'm list-ening"
So sad they split :/
About the party before the big party... I think it would be super awesome if all my male friends could join in on a collective effort to get me as drunk as humanly possible and humiliate me in every conceivable way
"And then a week or so after the wedding we should have _another_ party for those who couldn't come to the first three parties..."
Hey it’s the dude from TikTok!
i didn't actually know all these traditions and wow oh boy this sounds weird
Our relationship is NOBODY'S business... Except the government's.
Love that
I've always wondered how all of the wedding stuffs came about! I just this year realized why "if anyone objects to this Union speak now or forever hold your peace" was for wedding goers to speak up if they realized the bride and groom were related or if the groom was already married. Also I wonder, did you guys get weird looks from the people playing soccer or were they extras?
You have more subs than Ryan by 1k lol
This woman is a genius
Dat jacket tho! Reminds me of my super awesome Negan jacket
Great collab!
Funny! :D
Finally!!! Two favourites together!
"Well it's non-negotiable, I'm not sure what to tell you."
Yes
The collab I didn’t know I desperately needed in my life until I got it!! More of these please. They work very much for me and I would much like more, of these, please. Thank you.
Shortest marriage of the year - what was that, 3 hours?
You have wonderful cheek bones
YES!!!
Seeing Ryan George outside and not in front of a green screen makes me feel uncomfortable
I kid you not I really think that the practice of getting married started just like that
Collaboration videos with Ryan George are tight.
You can be honest, was that Ryan's idea? 'cause he's lowkey the inventor of "first ever"s. Also, I love you ^_^
Holy crap. Two of my favourite people in all of YouTube together. This is insane.
The starting of down on one knee tradition is hilarious and totally believable, in love with ya and your content;)
🤣🤣🤣
Is Julie getting more like drunk Julie or high Julie?
"Let's do this!!!"  Sounds like a great idea to me, super easy barely an inconvenience.
I swear- I keep discovering new youtubers completely separately, and then a few months after I find out about them they do a collab.  Example- longbeachgriffy & calebcity, ryan long and lewis spears, sneako with cer spence and ryan the leader, ryan and cer spence with cherdley’s.....  The lines are so blurred that it’s almost like all these youtubers are part of one bigger channel.
I don't know why but this video seems especially Canadian.
okay now this is  the best combination EVER omg
Love how people are just playing soccer in the background.
"Oh it's a double standard. Ok I get it. Yeah that's fine."
I didn't know the Garter thing
Ryan And Julie? Wayyy too much talent for one video.
Thank you for this collaboration! I love you both and this is the purrfect fusion dance I didn't know I wanted xD
YES YES YES!!! I have been waiting on this collaboration for so long!
Best. Crossover. Ever.  More, please!
You have great content.
hey you two have the same sub count.
Anyone also trying to determine if there's a green screen involved here
Can you show the wedding and bachelorette and bachelor party please
I totally ship Julie/Ryan
Hah, so funny and smart!
I joked before about you doing a double date with Ryan George and you and his alternate selves as a video, but now that you actually did a collab with Ryan George CAN YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS? It would be soo funny!
Ryan brought me here and I’m already subscribed. Great content!
Well ain’t this forking bullshirt
Ryan: That's alot of parties  Me: "laughs in Indian"
Just found you via Ryan George's divorce video.  I can't help noticing that you don't look like him, but I've subscribed anyway.
There are females in the Ryan Georgeverse..?!  Mind.  BLOWN.
My two favorite creators together!!!
OK....this is one of the best collabs I've seen... Hope there's more in the future.  If you haven't seen Ryan's Pitch Meetings....you're missing out.
"We could make a list." "Oh, I'm listening." Not sure why no one else below has referenced that. Definitely the best line.
Awesome! You guys are both great!
First people to be gay next
"So you want us to spend the rest of our lives together...?  Alright. I'm in."
Hilarious as usual. Gratitude for the laughs Julie and Ryan.
Two of my favorite youtubers🥰🥰
"I might lick whipped cream off a guy with a six pack." What..?? ......What..??
help, I'm gonna plan my wedding next year and this is what I'll be thinking about 💀
Im here because of Ryan Goerge!!! Super fan forever!!!
Somehow it sounds little shady but am into her
Julie and Ryan in the same video? YES!
For some reason I can see Ryan George emerging through ya...good work 🔥🔥. Love from @Ryan George Family
Whatching both of their videos back to back is so fun
Ryan sent me
Oh my god!!! Comedy colab of my dreams!
Gift registries are NOT TIGHT  *but they're also super easy, barely an inconvenience... so, Idunno
This is the best thing on the internet ever
You forgot about making your parents pay for the “big party”....lol
F**king Awesome... this is exactly how the first one happened ... I read it somewhere  Probably here.
It's like two universe collapse :o
My two most favourite YouTuber collaborating!! Couldn't ask for more....
You have got some beautiful eyes
Loved this...you guys should of worked a “that’s TIGHT” in there or Alternative Julie
They have almost identical number of subs😅
And when the girl gets tired of you, she gets to leave and take half (or more depending on the lawyer she has) of your stuff plus financial aid from you for life.
This sounds kind-of shady, but I’m into it.  This marriage isn’t going to last #ohwait
"Are you just saying that so you don't have to go shopping with me?"  Genius! 🤣
Genius!
Man this was intense
Ah yes, the crossover we were all waiting for
My two favourite YouTubers on one video.... Wow wow wow🤓
wowowowowowow...two of the best utubers who can create contents from the most  awkward situations and self aware acting😅
I'll say it again, a dream come true seeing these 2 Canadian YouTubers collaborating!
my two favorite internet comedians. i'm not even making that up
So weird to see Ryan shave his beard and grow out long blonde hair. Wait, what’s going here?
No problem! Barely an Inconvenient!
Outstanding. Perfect collab, nothing could ever go wrong
Everyone: So how difficult was getting this beautiful girl?  Ryan: Super Easy. Barely an inconvenience.
I've been a big fan of Ryan's for a long time, and this video brought me to your channel. So, of course, I had to watch all of your previous videos. Which was great, you know...you're funny as hell and your concepts are brilliant. But, ummm...now there's this little...itty bitty, one might say...very small problem...  ...it seems that I am now, what's the word?...oh yeah...completely in love with you. Yeah, that's it. Seems that I have a thing for a genius-level sense of humor. I mean, it was really weird, I woke up this morning quite happy with frittering about in my own way and now I have this urge to kill a large animal and present it to you to show off my ability to take care of you. Isn't that strange? 🤔
I was already subscribed to both of you, Go Canukle heads  lol
*When two of your favorite YouTubers collaborate:*  Michael Scott: “I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream!”
Oh wow Now I really do wonder how the first ever marriage happened
Amazing! Same time next week? (Please keep collaborating)
Bachelor parties😂😂😂😂  For rich or poor😂😂😂
After seing so many ryans, he married the first non ryan. Btw so cool to see the crossover of the julieverse with the ryanverse
Julie and Ryan together is like 'breakfast for dinner'; not something I usually think of as going together, but once you experience it in combo you don't know why you didn't think of it earlier 🙂
I love these two and this collab is the highlight of my day.
Really?  They decided all those conventions in one conversation?  I hate them 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been waiting for this...
Why do you guys have almost the same number of subscribers? It's weird. Stahp it!
HE LOOKS LIKE TREY KENEDY
oh wow there are boys in the julie nolke universe
Me and my wife decided on smashing our names together and making a new name She was Whitehead, I was Sutton and now it's whitton. Kinda lame but hey ho
Are you guys in a sub race?
You mean to tell me it All started becoz of a SIMP
My two favourite 2020-discovered YouTubers!!!
Ryan send me here
Thanks for the birthday laughs!
This was a crossover I didn't know I needed...
YES! Ryan George! <3
Oh... I get it.
This was the collaboration/crossover we needed AND deserved! Thank you both! Viva Canada!
2:54 Aw, double standards are TIGHT!
watching this was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
so this was taken on 2350 B.C
Best of both !
Let's see.... what happens when you take two youtubers (each one famous for making videos of them talking to themselves) then talk to [wait for it...] EACH OTHER? — well, as it happens: magic.
Wedding registry:  The only polite way to say, "You need to give me exactly what I want and absolutely nothing else, because I deserve it."
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this!  This is the greatest thing that happened to me in 2020!  ....Not that it was a big list.  It was like, Number one: Julie Nolke/Ryan George Collaboration, Number Two: not having to wear pants as much
This collaboration is fantastic! Had no idea this channel existed, but Ryan's channel brought me along and now....here I am. Subscribing. 😁👍
One video for you, one video for me. Glad you both could split the assets equally! Wanna say I suggested this crossover a few months ago, never thought it'd happen!
You are the perfect pair... of sketch writers. Love you both :)
This has been a collab I have wanted for so long! So awesome!
This is gold..
OMG..  Julie and Ryan together.. wow wow wow..
Well if he's in..
I love this collab and the second part, two of my favorite creators coming together.
"Somehow that sounds a little shady but I'm into it." Loved that line.
Yo omg guys too close!!! That ain’t 6 feet!!!!
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow!
Not only did we get 2 julia nolke videos today, but we also got two ryan george videos. I fucking love october.
The Ryanverse is leaking into other universes.
Glad to see Ryan collab with someone who isn't himself
You guys work really well together.
This is a dream come true!
Clicking over from Ryan's videos (and maybe a new sub here) was easy, barely an inconvenience
Omg a mash up of my favourite funny channels 🥰🥰
YOU GUYS, YOUR CHOCOLATE IS IN MY PEANUT BUTTER! I'm exploding with fandom right now. Great jorb.
Love it!
I dont know what to do...  Do I type "I see Julie Nolke, I click" or "I see Ryan George, I click"?
Haha Julie you have 1k more subscribers as Ryan.  Are we all the same people?!
Julie Nolke is tight.... wait thats wrong, she's super easy, barely an inconvenience. Nope thats worse can you please get all the way off my back?! But seriously great video
I think you should get a husband that looks more like you.
My dad complains about the removing the garter bit every time we go to a wedding. I would have to agree. Everyone is uncomfortable...why do we still do it
Watching the first couple to ever get married is tight!
So are youll are now in a relationship? I'm confused and interested 😂 in Ryan voice and acting lol
Julie ur amazing uwu😢
Can't wait to see the video of the first couple to ever get divorced! Love ya Julie!
si se van a casar?
OMG! Two of my faves. Dope collab
When you see the divorce video before the marriage
I never thought that two of the funniest people I follow in youtube will come together like this! So cool!
The collab we all didn’t know we needed!!! 😱😱😱
So the two channels that gained popularity for talking to themselves are talking to each other. Brilliant 😆
That was perfect. And I’m not doin’ any of it. Lol.
We only watched cause Ryan George was in it!!!
I freaked out seeing this in my sub box, love you both. 🤣
*I can't believe this collab is happening* 2020 might finally be letting up
Damn you Ryan, now I have more videos to watch
Getting married, super easy bearly an inconvenience.
This is weird. How come the other person in this video looks nothing like Ryan?? I’m very confused.
Julie is the best thing on the internet this year!
Ryan George is a genius and you are too
I wrote a paper in college about the history of wedding traditions and while this makes me laugh, it also makes me cringe, so now I don't know how to feel about it.
So these assholes are to blame for the thousands of dollars I’ve spent at friends showers/parties?? Thanks a lot guys.
Please get married in real life and post videos all the time kay thank you
Lmao you both have the exact same amount of subscribers
Oh its a double standard
This is all so super easy, barely an inconvenience!
And this is why he discovered everything is barely an inconvenience.
As a West Coast Canadian, I find their East Coast Canadian  accents extra amusing 😂
The collab we all needed
shoutout to the guy in the back at 2:36!
Oh my, how cool is it to know about these two, love their videos, and now see them both collaborate😃  You should do that more often, guys!
My two favourite Youtube comedians making a video together!!! Awesome!
Oh my, how cool is it to know about these two, love their videos, and now see them both collaborate😃  You should do that more often, guys!
love love love that you give it to us in so many wonderful funny true forms! thanks a bunch for taking the time and crafting the goodness!
My god, I have finally found the female version of Ryan George (or Vise versa)
I was expecting Julie to go like "don't you feel like this is going to be a lot of work?" And Ryan goes "actually no. It's going to be super easy. Barely an inconvenience"
My two fav Canadian youtubers together?? Dream come true. Props for doing this in red alert state 🤣 did Julia go to montreal or did ryan go to Toronto?
I have been secretly shipping the two of you since I discovered your channel and binged a bunch of your videos. I haven't watched this one yet but it makes me so happy it actually exists! :D
are you from Montreal by any chance?
Holy Shiiiit!! I was literally thinking just last week, how awesome it would be if my 2 favorite Canadian youtuber's did a collaboration... and LOOK AT THIS!.. now I can say, at least one good thing has happened in 2020 :D
What are the odds you both have 604k subscribers at the time of this comment?
The colab to save 2020.
I actually want you guys to be a couple😂😂😂
Omg omg! Congratulations, you make such a cute couple!!!!! Where can I send the obligatory toaster?
Taking garters off with your mouth is tight!
Pretty weird both have 604k subsribers
“Oh... oh it’s a double standard. Oh I get it. OK. Yeah, that’s fine.”  “Double standards are TIGHT!” 😅
Best crossover ever.
This was not a genius idea and yet it was.  Sure points out the ridiculous and incredibly stupid traditions of marriage.
The collab I didn't know I needed.
Awesome Jules...
Awesome Jules...
I wonder when she's going to do a back flip snap the bad guys neck and save the day
omg RYAN HAS LEGS!!!!
I learned about a cool tradition the Amish follow: Men are forbidden to grow beards unless they're married.  But after they're married, it's required.  It's like a wedding ring that is permanently attached to their face.
This is the crossover I never knew I wanted. This is bigger than the mcu. Mind bending. Another person in the Ryanverse!!!
This is one of the best collabs I've ever seen.  And both of them having EXACTLY 604k subscribers is like the icing on the perfect collab cake.
Watching the divorce before the wedding  _Smart_ _Hulk_: *TIME* *TRAVEL*...!!!
Ohh I see, you got married in the Julie verse then got divorced in the Ryan verse, wow wow wow, Wow
Shoulda watched this 20 years ago LOL
So was the wedding hard to plan?  “Not all, barely and inconvenience”
I'm here because of my boy Ryan George. Nice video, very funny!
Omg !!! Both of you !!!! Bliss!!! More
Well Julie, I'm afraid your kids are all gonna look just like him. It's believed that Ryans are an invasive species that leave the colony to find females of other species to multiply with.
Julie Nolke's executive producer: So will it be hard to for the channel get a algorithm boost by way of increased ammount of comments? Intern: That's actually going to be super easy, barely an inconveniance! Exec: wow, wow, wow - let's hear it! Intern: Invite Ryan George to make a cameo! Exec: Ok, but arn't his fans kind of dorks? Intern: Look, I need you to get aaaaaaaall the way of my back about this. Exec: Ok, let me get off of that thing.  Intern: Besides, the dorks will absolutley subscribe to the channel because we rock Exec: Dorks who subscribe to our channel are TIGHT.
This is the crossover event I didn't know I needed
Not seeing two Ryan was extremely difficult and all the inconvenience in the world. But seeing a girl who not looks like Ryan was Tight...
Thank you for displaying how completely ridiculous weddings/marriages are.  Such an outdated construct - DON'T DO IT, PEOPLE!
OMG.  My two favorite YT sketch people IN ONE PLACE.
This collaboration is the most natural thing to have ever happened on YouTube.
Imagine here announcing she was getting married at the end of the video
Before watching I want to say that I was wondering when you two (my favorite youtubers of this type) will make some sort crossover, because I think it was only a matter of time. So I hope you two will pamper us more with this type of content. :)
What a cross over 👏
So weird to see mirror Julie talking to that guy that created names
I gotta agree with him on the garter belt being weird. I still don't get that one.
You both are exceptionally attractive AND funny AND practical about this whole marriage thing.😳 Triple Threat!!!😋🥰🤣⚘👰🤵💍💒
"We'll pay a woman to take her clothes off, and then we'll all pretend like that's not an uncomfortable situation to be in!"
whoa, you BOTH have 604K subscribers at the moment?!  You two are MADE for each other!!
They both have exactly 604k subscribers.. 🤔
Please do more collabs with each other, this is fantastic!
omg omg omg omg omg
I have that same faux leather jacket, pog
Oooo Lists are Tight!
Holy crap...you two are PERFECT together, comedy-wise. Your similar energy, similar tone...more collabs please! That was BRILLIANT!
LMFAO Julie YOU ARE hilarious 🤣 Way to go and your partner a natural, congratulations you two
He makes super funny videos.  Just... like where he's talking to himself.
Is my YouTube broken or do both Ryan a julie have 604k subscribers?
I can't believe it. Ryan finally met someone other than himself. Inspirimg
More with Ryan George please and thank you
Luv d script
Collab I didn't know I wanted but fankss
Why am I both surprised and not surprised that Julie and Ryan know each other. At least well enough to do this collaboration. Can I have more please?
Hahahah this was great!
did anyone notice that they have the same number of subs  that is weird
Ryan does not talk to himself, he talks to other ryan shaped people.
If she is in, I am out.
wtf they both have the exact same number of subs atm, 604k!
The first weddings for hundreds of years Everyone actually wore brown it wasn’t till a queen wore white to her wedding that it became One of the highest symbols of wealth Because back then you couldn’t really clean so once you got your white clothes dirty they were dirty forever I might not be explaining it perfectly but the more you know right
Great collaboration guys! Two of my favourite Youtube personalities getting together!  Hmmm.... I think I might have a movie idea for this.
Its like the invention of lying
Flu or coma I would hate to catch a coma
Ryan George brought me here
A crossover the world didn’t know it wanted yet needs.
Correction: First couple to ever get married IN AMERICA
OH MY GOSH! My two favorite YouTubers made a video together! YES!
So you have a crossover  for me?  Yes sir I do
Never clicked on a video faster!!
I was jumping for joy inside 😃 when I saw this pop up in my subscriptions feed! LOL
Why is he getting double the number of comments!?  Show business is the ultimate continual divorce that needs to be always more exciting!?!?🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🗽🚀🌈☮️💟🥇
The Collab I never knew I wanted.
This is the crossover that we needed.
You guys should do more together!
OMG. Is this in any way shape or form happening because of a suggestion I made months ago on another video of yours? Probably not but it's my head canon now. You two are amazing!
Whaaaaat! No way! This is the collab I've been waiting for! Thank you God!
forgot to mention a giant conglomerate of business dedicated to taking all your money and create a industry dedicated to make people spend more and more in competition with each other for this one day
Um, husband and I literally just said LAST NIGHT “Julie that did the pandemic thing and the Screen Rant dude should totally collab.” And here we are :)
No.
That guy is really tough to look at. I bet he spends all day talking to himself.
198k for the divorce and 138k for the marriage @ 3 hours
This was fucking epic and hilarious. 😄 Great content as always, Julie.
Ryan was perfect!  ‘Is that just so u don’t have to come shopping with me?’ ‘No, no, no...’😆😆😆
Julie George is a horrible name. It’s bad enough you’re dating a guy with two first names; you don’t want to marry into that.
Funny
New subscriber because it was super easy...barely an inconvenience.
This was literally the ultimate crossover
So strange to see Ryan in a video with someone besides himself. I like it.
Finally, as predicted. My two favorite Canadians who talk to themselves have made somewhat of a cross over. My job here is done.
truly clever love it thanks
This is the best collab of the decade
Don't dooo it julieeeee. I've seen the future. You guys get devorced. And make your hate official later
The collab I unconsciously needed
This team up is epic.
I didn’t know this channel existed your plan is working flawlessly
So this is what the world has come to. People getting famous for talking to themselves.
can we get ryan the 4th and drunk julie together now?
Ryan: Do you wanna spend the rest of your life with me  Julie: Wow wow wow. . . wow
*My worlds have collided*
Your two collabs are amazing!! You guys match energy so well!! Thanks for these and cheers!!
Him: together forever! Her: forever?  Us: oopsie!
Getting married is TIGHT!
Him: "Here is a ring for you."  Her: "Should I get one for you?"  Him: "No."  Her: "Why?"  Him: "Because I want everyone to know you are taken, but assume I am still single."  Her: "That sounds odd."
This makes it a wonderful day!
Top 10 anime crossovers
Giving a ring is super easy barely an inconvenience
Two of my most favourite Canadian comedians on YouTube.... This made my day..
This is exactly what I never knew I needed
It feels weird posting Pitch Meeting quotes on a channel that isn't Ryan's. But the fact that I can is TIGHT.
After watching both of these, I feel that divorce makes more sense than weddings...
You guys make a GREAT team!
HOLY CRAP, MY TWO FAVORITES!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! how did you get ryan to not talk to ryan?!?!?
Super easy, barely an inconvenience?
I don’t think they actually met for this video this is all green screened
I DON'T BELIEVE ITTTTT. TWO OF MY FAVS TOGETHER AAAHHH THIS COLLAB IS  A DREAM
Wait I don't like this, how do they both have 603k Subs, doing similar stuff, this is just too weird for me
I feel like I watched these in backward order...
This is great, I'd love to share it with my "I don't speak english" French friends, unfortunately there's apparently no way I can add French subtitles to your video.
Yep, brings back memories. What were we thinking?  Next time around, Las Vegas Drive-thru Wedding Chaple.
Omg omg omg! My two favorite YouTubers Colabing!
Oh my god I have been following the both of you and I am SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW!
Awww getting married is tight!
I'm so glad I found this channel a week ago!!!
Girls exist in this universe?
“Are you just saying that so you don’t have to go shopping with me” lol
The crossover we didn’t know we needed.  Thank you Ryan and Julie for your amazing content.
"We could make a list" "Oh I'm LISTening" get it?
I want you making videos together FOREVER!
I've been waiting for this colab!!!
Having seen both of the videos now, I love how the separate styles of both creators are perfectly intact across the different channels
So.. crazy thought. Maybe, you know.. Do get married!
I love the two of you
Both channels have 603k subs
I hope they end up together ❤️
Have anyone noticed that Ryan's style of video is in Julie's channel and vice versa
TWO JN/RG collabs in one day??? 2020 is looking a little brighter.
I actually watched the Divorced one first lol.  Time travel is fun.  Great video.
Literally called this crossover months ago lol. Person talking to a copy of themselves about a societal norm and somehow this only happened now
I have found this channel from the collab on ryan george's channel, and so far it's lit
Hahaha oh man I love this. I'm getting married. Or I was. Corona and stuff... 🤐😶☹️
The Canadian Superstores! Oops! I mean Superstars!
Showers are tight!
They... both have the same number of subscribers... Coincidence?
Omg, both you and Ryan have 603K subs.  You were meant for each other! Too bad about the divorce...  :/
wow julie and ryan have exactly the same number of subs, live in montreal and make videos where they only talk to other versions of themselves, i'm starting to think they're the same person
So they got married and divorced within the same hour
0:51 "we can make a list" "Oh I'm LISTening"
Youtubers getting married is TIGHT
The teamup I weirdly never thought of, but now I can't believe I never thought of it this is perfect
So is Julie somehow in the Ryanverse? How does she tell all the Ryans apart? This is blowing my mind. Are there other Julie's? Are there other... people?!
Endgame is the biggest crossover !  Ryan and Julie - Hold my Super easy barely an inconvenience..
Thumbs up if you came here after watching the divorce video.
I really wanted to see the wedding,were all the men were ryan and the women were either all julie or ryan in women clothes
ITS BEEN DONE!!! BEST COLLAB OF 2020
This is like chocolate and peanut butter.  I love it.
Seeing Ryan in Julie's video is TIGHT !
Why is it weird to see him irl and not on greenscreen
"SHOWER?"  Will it be Posted/ video'd ?
I love everything about this <3
Is this the same couple that got divorced 😔
This is the greatest collab. There will be no better collabs than this. You can close YouTube now.
Oh, going to other channels and leaving inside jokes is tight!
Two of my favourites. This is underrated. I love you both.
Yooooo, this is nuts!!! Two of my favorite youtubers together?!? I hope yall continue to work together in the future!!!
My 2 Fav Canadians (besides my parents)
I wonder how many time they got interrupted the soccer ball. Can we see some  bloopers :)
The video to me is basically a prequel to the divorce
Wow Julie, you and Ryan now have the exact same number of subscribers (603k), congrats on growing from like 100-200k earlier this year!
When ryan george is involved. i'm watching it
I've been waiting for this moment!
You should do a Rom Com Pitch Meeting together!
Is anyone gonna talk about the fact they both have the same number of subs
You know the way each of those ACTUALLY came to be a thing is WAY more interesting
It's weird he didn't start with hi there Hello
Holy Shit... Julie and Ryan Collab???? Two of my favourite Youtubers finally come together... the akwardness meter explodes !!!!!
Wow.  Wowowowow.
"Oh, ohh, it's a double standard. Oh, I get it. Yeah, that's fine."
Is this the Oprah murder porn from south park or trans rights in korea. Season two of the Seoul class show. I want Joon back for Luke
crossover of the century!
*_JULIE NOLKE AND RYAN GEORGE IN A VIDEO?! THE VERY ESSENCE OF MY BEING NEARLY IMPLODED!!!_*  (Today’s also my first day of college, so that makes this extra special, in a way.)
they both have exactly 603k subscribers!!! Is this like part of the matching tracksuits bit??
You guys colab makes my life complete.
Why has YouTube's algorithm not suggested you for me yet? I have literally watched all of Ryan's videos. His personal, Screen Rant, and that one where he introduced human societal aspects to an alien. New sub here get ready for some likes.
I'm confused😂there is another person that isn't Ryan, shouldn't it be Ryan in a wig?
Love Ryan's stuff, Love Julie's stuff.. Hope to see More stuff in the future! ;)
These two clips should be mandatory viewing for anyone wanting to get married!! So awesome and true!!!
Love both the videos
Wow , both have the exactly same number of subscribers 😎
Totally easy! Barely an inconvenience!
They have almost identical subscriber counts?
AH HAHAHA That didn't last long. You two are for realz funny.
When two of your favorite YouTube comedians collaborate <3. Unexpected and amazing!
How the heck does both channels have the same amount of subs. Crazy coincidence?
I'm watching the backwards order of these videos🤣
When they decide they’d hire a DJ to play some of the most obnoxious music to ever exist, like The Chicken Dance and Macarena?
"Avengers Endgame was the most ambitious crossover in history" Me, an intellectual:
Ah...I hope you two stay together...
Lol. I like that they could have done a big get up to make this look prehistoric but abandoned that entirely
1:11 If you want yo be perfectly accurate, wearing all white at weddings did not start off symbol of virginity, it was a sign that you were rich enough to afford an all white dress.   Source: Adam Ruins Everything
A better tile: The first girl ever
Crossovers are TIGHT!
Anyone else think it’s crazy they both have 603k subscribers?
Married Couple cinematic universe😂😂😂😂😂😂
A collab between two of my favorite youtubers.  Legit the crossover I never knew could have existed and very much what I wanted.
I came from the divorce video
Wowwwwwwww... Two of my favourite YouTubers in the same video... This is an ambitious crossover the *JulieNolke* Universe and the *RyanGeorge* Universe LOVE IT💜💜
I rarely comment on videos but this is literally a collab between two of my favorite creators so I kinda had to. AMAZING.
It's the first time I have ever watched the first video, subscribed to a channel, and clicked the bell button simultaneously
A Shower, with Gifts? :-D
-"And there'll be a ring bear" -"Oh a ring bearer, a good idea!" -"Yes yes, a ring bear."
Julie Nolke and Ryan George make a sketch together? Paradise
Julie, you should watch this https://youtu.be/meJB-RZvBcY She look a lot like you
Still a better love story than Twilight
I watched it in reverse now I hate myself
They both have the EXACT same number of subscribers.
When you see two youtubers you subscribe to collaborate: 😃
My wife for now kept her last name and I was like that’s cool 😎
Is it me, or does Julie sound extra Canadian in this one?
And so the cinematic universe begins
my 2 fave youtubers who have videos where they talk to themselves playing different characters have now done a crossover!! *mindblown*
What are you doing down there?Oh tying my shoe .Here’s a ring  Epic
Should make the next one "The First Couple Ever to Elope", would be a great contrast :)  Love the videos by the way! Awesome work as usual!
Great collaboration, I’m a fan of both of your channels. I got a suggestion: first couple to move in together :)
Imagine someone walking and thinking there getting married 👰
This was Brilliant!!!!!
The guy in the background tho
I’ve been waiting for the ultimate Canadian comedy crossover! So good!
Who is here after they got divorced
what about another party on the day before the big one to.. idk.. rehearse the big one ?
I’m so happy you guys collabbed
Best crossover since Batman and Scooby-Doo.
I love this collab
Julie: How the hell are we going to finance all this? Ryan: That's actually going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience. Julie: Oh, really?
Please, nobody think of the children!  Don't even mention that child!
My theory  Julie is a shapeshiftong Ryan
YES!!!!! The collab i was waiting to see!!!  when the borders open up, I'd love to see a Julie Nolke and Gus Johnson collab!!
Did anyone else notice that both Ryan and Julie both have exactly 603k subs?
Nailed. Weird. WTF.  You explained also the reason for my divorce! 😂😂😂😂
U and ryan both have same 603k subs rn lol
It was a great collab. I never figured it out before, subscribed to both of you but you match so well. Now I really gonna imagine you getting married. (Is that you call "shipping" ? I learnt about it two days ago.)
So stoked all of you collaborate
The Julie Nolke universe is expanding...
Wow... it's weird, those moments that I remember that Latter-day Saints have a lot of differences from even just the culture of typical Christian weddings.  Celebrating a marriage seems to become a lot more restrained when you remove alcohol.
Ryannnnnn!!!💜
Wow... it's weird, those moments that I remember that Latter-day Saints have a lot of differences from even just the culture of typical Christian weddings.  Celebrating a marriage seems to become a lot more restrained when you remove alcohol.
Omg yes! The two of you on screen is like Christmas in July! Only, in October, but we do like presents any time
Anyone after first divorce
That moment when you're fans of two creators independently and then they collab.
My two favorite YouTube comedians collaborating on videos?!? I just came so hard from just reading this video's title. I then wiped my TV screen and watched it. Great work. Love it! 🤣🤣🤣
Julie and Ryan together, amazing!
Just jotting down some notes, only thing missing is the person who actually wants to marry me 😭😭😭 hahahaha
Great to see you collab with Ryan George.
Julie George has a nice ring to it. Get it, RING?
Finally...My two favourite Canadian comic geniuses! 🎆🎉🎈🍾🥂
Most those annoying traditions come from wealthy people, often royalty. Weddings used to be pretty simple and informal.
You two are so funny! I've only just found your channel a few months ago, but I've been following his for a while now. Awesome collab, super enjoyed every second of it!
I'm a r and George subscriber he told me to subscribe to your Channel so that's what I did I did that. I'm looking forward to watching your videos.
After she changes her last name to his, he'll change his last name to her new last name.
Getting here from Ryan's chanel was super easy, barely an inconvenience!       I think I'll be ur new subscriber
Two of my favorites! Love the colab! Hilarious stuff y’all!!!
Are you a real couple?
Getting a divorce is tight! No, really, it is. ~8^)
Who else saw the divorce before the marriage
Holy shit, an unexpected collab appeared!
Great collaboration!!
Both of my favourite observational sketch comedy YouTubers TOGETHER!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Two people obsessed talking to themselves. The ideal pair
Yes!  Finally a video of the absurdity of marriage!!!  "Are you gonna change your name"? Noo. I love you so much, let's get the government involved.
Oh it's a double standard that's ok
This is literally how my Husband asked me to marry him.  Him:  Hey you want to spend the rest of your life with me?  Me:  Sure why not.  And we are still together 22 years later.  Not without the challenges ❤️  But still plugging away with this marriage thing.
Who did Ryan's makeup? He looks exactly like Julie.  Which reminds me, I hope future Julie didn't get lost in the timestream
😂😂😂 haha best YouTube comedy collaboration this year thus far!
i think i watched this videos in the wrong order
I'm surprised at how the inception of marriage was super easy and barely an inconvenience
SO READT FOR THIS TEAMUP EEK
Collab we've been waiting for.
two people talking to themselves on a daily basis. You had to become married!
We just went to the courthouse, paid witnesses in rolls of quarters, because we forgot we needed witnesses and we had just been doing laundry. Been married 20 years.
"its not negotiable,i don know what to tell you!!" killed me cuz i say that too!!!!
We gotta make a list.     Yeah I’m LISTening😏😏
Adam Conover taught me that weddings didn't used to involve rings or white dresses
ok so i didnt know about this person until this collab and she is so funny lmao immediate new sub
So accurate 😂
My two favourite people on Youtube doing two videos together. I just... 😍
THE CROSSOVER THE WORLD HAS AWAITED!
Aziz Ansari once did a bit something like this, but took it in a very different direction: how insane and controlling the very notion of marriage is. Dunno why I'm mentioning Aziz, except maybe to head off anyone being all "Simpsons did it!" There is only a finite number of topics in the universe, and two comedians doing the same topic counts for nothing. Now if they make the same jokes -- which is not happening here -- that's when it gets suspicious.  tl/dr you rule Julie!
The greatest crossover episode ever!
Julie: How can I get another person during the pandemic to film with... Ryan: That's super easy, barely an inconvenience!
I'm getting married Saturday. This is hilarious!
my two favorite youtubers
Was it difficult arranging this co-lab crossover? ;-)
Not the crossover I expected.  But definitely the crossover I needed.
Jokes on you, I'm already subscribed to you both, so why don't you just get aaaall the way off my back.
Dream collaboration.... now date and make it live on YT
Love the cross over... Unfortunately, spoilers... I saw the divorce first.
This video only only has one Ryan in so isn't part of the Ryan-george cinematic universe
Seeing ryan with someone else other than himself is kinda weird....and also getting married is supereasy barely an inconvenience.
Collaborations between two of my favorite youtubers are tight!
I watched these in the wrong order
Well, I found you via this video, but you have the same energy as Ryan, so now I need to watch every video on the channel.  Oh well, binging videos is Tight.
Me: How was the proposal Ryan?  Ryan: Super easy, barely an inconvenience!
It’s like this video was ment to be
They’re gonna be the best couple ever…  *sees Ryan’s video  So that was a fucking lie 😭
Damn, you rock that bomber jacket so well!
Badges? Matching tracksuits? 🤣 🤣
Being swept up in the moment is tight! @Ryan George
Absolute genius sketch !
I’m sub to both of you and just know realized I should have watched yours first 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ryan makes videos where he talks to himself? That's a bit weird.
The colab I never knew I needed it
Ryan George looks very different playing the 2 parts in this video. I can't quite place my finger on it.
This collaboration is everything. Thank you very much. 💜🤩🙌🏼
Ohhhh online Collaborations are TIGHT
Wonderful.  Thanks for getting with Ryan George for these two skits.  You guys are great and very talented.
"It must have been hard getting to do a collab with Ryan." "Actually it was super easy.  Barely an inconvenience!"
Well that didn’t last long
More collabs pls, thanks.
The fact that you made a two episode miniseries about this…
You guys are magic together. Like I can't believe you're not married already
I hope this marriage goes well and they never ever get divorced
For richer or poorer.... wait what?!?! I feel like you just glossed over that last part 🤣😂
Well, this is my new favorite youtube collaboration!
Two of my favorite YouTubers collaborating!!
WHAT??? Ryan and Julie in the same video????? This is AWESOME!
Ryan sent me
Guys my secret wish came true I think I have superpowers.
The reason wedding dresses are white is because rich people always married in white, because white clothing was hard to keep clean and therefor expensive. So it was basically a way for them to rub their wealth into other peoples faces, who then were like "Oh no! If I don't wear white, everyone will think I'm poor!"
Marriage is fun
My two favorite Youtubers ever together, 2020 is taking a new turn which I like.
I have a strong feeling this marriage is going to last forever!
Also. OH it's a double standard, oh yeah that's fine  XD
crossovers between people wg\ho talk to themselves are tight
They have the same amount of subs. I guess that’s kind of cool
Aww, exchanging lifelong commitments is TIGHT!
If you die.... I don't wanna have to stay with the body... XD
You know for the bachelor party I will need you to get all the way off of my back.
Your videos simultaneously make me laugh my ass off and have an existential crisis at the same time. That's pretty impressive, kudos sir.
Crossover nice!
Wished I watched this one first😪
The crossover I never knew I needed
The crossover I didn’t know I needed.
The chemistry between these two 👌
Never expected duo between you and Ryan. Nice surprise.
*5 seconds into the video*  Oh that's the trailers' guy who talks to himself in different clothes !!!
OMG. I literally posted this collab as request in one of (Mirror) Julie’s videos a week or two ago. Yes yes <3
no way. watching both channels since quarantine. and now i can see both weirdos in one video. A+
One of the Ryans looks weird. I guess it's because he shaved?
Is this from the pitch meeting cinematic universe?
My two favourite soliloquists collaborating! Yay!
OH MY GOD YES.
OMG THE COLLAB OF THE CENTURY
LOLOL this is a great video. i do hope people can make their own rules for THEIR marriage even if they take these archaic vows.
Bout time you two met. I bet it was super easy...barely an inconvenience.
Thank you Julie
Wow, what a great collab!
This marriage really sounds great. Triple parties, gift lists, richer or poorer you're together forever... sounds super easy, like barely an inconvenience.
This is amazing, glad to see y'all collab. Yep...I ship it.  Also congrats on 600K+ subs to both of you!
this isn't a collab i knew i needed, thank you for this gift
This was really, extremely well done. Some might even say it was very well done. I'd even risk it and say this was quite well done. Seriously though I loved this
Ryan and Julie collab?! Yes please!!!
Wow, my two favorite YouTubers together in one video!!!  :-)
HA! my parent's agreement in a nutshell. 40 years strong in sickness and health
Marvel: Infinty War is the most ambitious crossover ever Julie & Ryan: Hold our YouTube-beers!
Fan moment 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The first "Ryan George taking to another Human being".
Pulling off garters infront of blood relatives is tight!
Julie came on so chill lol I believe this exactly how it went tho
I’ve died and traveled to the Ryan-verse because this is amazing
The collab of the century. I've been waiting to see you both in the same video since I stumbled across your channels.
jesus, 11k likes anbd only under 50dislikes, this Girl is on fire!
I smell a future together...collabs for life partners?
Two of my faves in the collab I never knew I needed!
I didn't know ryan owned a long blonde wig and could change his voice like that.
If all the men look like Ryan in the ryanverse, does that mean all women look like Julie as well?
Collab of the century
Ryan not being in front of a green screen and talking to another human being is weird
my favorite two yt personalities met...and married..and stuff
I always worried Ryanverse was just version of him. Know I know all the Women are Julie... Makes me feel better....
The most ambitious cross over with the Ryan verse.
This girl is having more subscribers than ryan ? That doesn't feel fair.
if people bring gold jewelry and stuff as gifts would that make it a 'golden shower'?
Idk why but there is WAYYY less sexual tension in this video than the divorce video.
Matching track suits.
Yes! Have been waiting for this team up! Already gave it a like, now on to watching the video...
MY WORLDS JUST COLLIDED YALL ARE LIKE MY TWO FAVORITE COMEDY CHANNELS THIS IS THE BEST COLLAB EVER
“I want to wear all white”  “Oh risky okay”
YES!!!! This is one of the greatest collars ever!😂 great job guys
Ryan shows more emotion in this video than all his others combined.
The Pitch Meeting guy!!
How did you get George away from his green screen?!?!?!
Marriages are shady now
I just love how my two of my favorite pandemic channels have collided!
It was super easy barely an inconvenience
Double standards are tight
Omg the collab I never knew I needed
I suspect the two of you were actually 10 ft apart the whole time
Girl u had me dying!
The first and most expensive marriage. Julie is hilarious.
This so funny😂😂😂
Fake. Ryan would have done this with himself in a wig
This. This was a crossover I absolutely wanted but never dreamed I'd get.
Julie Nolke is now officially Julie George
Ryan talking to himself & naming himself Julie classic
...The subscriber counts of these two channels are ALMOST identical. Kinda creepy
Julie, you need to get all the way off his back now
Enough of these and we'll start to have a Canadian youtuber cinematic universe.
When you are watching a video and constantly thinking 💭 “I got to remember that one.. 🤣!”, “And that one”,.... You two (and all people involved) are awesome!
Matching tracksuits makes sense in my mind
...anyone else getting awesome "niece of Wynona Ryder" vibes from Julie? (Young funny/cute side, not Wyn's old weirdo side.😂💜)
I’m already subbed to you both
I think there is a conspiracy going: If I look on you both guys subscription numbers.... Let me guess: 600.000 names are the same, and then a couple of random other guys got thrown in, just to distract us from the truth. I mean, think of it: does anyone of you other people here know more than 20 subscribers personally? And additonally: I just unsubscribed and the number didn't change! When I did this by my moms channel the numbers went down and up by roughly 25%!! Scandal!
This was so well written!
🤣🤣🤣
It finally happened! Please do more! Lots more!
Ooh more funnies
His eyes are so blue <3 <3
These two already got divorced. :( Julie took half his money and possessions. Crazy Julie in the mirror took the other half. This Ryan guy is homeless now and can be found talking to glass windows in front of random shops.
I have seriously been day-dreaming about a collaboration between you two guys XD. You're both in my top youtubers
When you announced on your Patreon that you were collaborating with another YouTuber, I was expecting David Attenborough, but Ryan will do 😉
THIS IS KINDA CRINGY YET SO FUNNY
Two of my favorites together
"You know what I'm swept up in the moment let's do this."  Over on Ryan's channel: The first couple to get divorced
Excellent job, great collabs, loved both videos Julie and Ryan!!!
Fun facts: ❤️ She’s the best actor 🧡 You are scrolling through the comments  💛 You aren’t on full screen but still watching 💚 You haven’t finished the video  💙 But you’ve definitely started the video 💜 You liked this comment?   💕 Thank you!
Now this might be the best crossover in the history of crossovers
Best crossover ever!
Funny I just watched the divorce one just before this one lol 😎👍
The biggest crossover we didn't know we wanted!
Two of my favorite comedians on YouTube! Greatest crossover ever
-So u have a ‘First couple to get married’ script for me? ~Yes sir I do -So what’s the video about  ~Well firstly we’ll not be using a green screen this time.  -Oh my God  ~What, you don’t like it? -I don’t know if people would want to watch a video without a green screen in it. I don’t think they’ll like that.  ~Well I don’t know what to say here -How do we make them like that? ~Well it’s actually super easy, barely an inconvenience.  -Oh really ~We’ll just film the video on a planet called Earth, which belongs to a whole other universe, which looks exactly like our green screen.  -But there are other people in there, and we might even have to meet them.  ~Listen sir, you’ll have to get all the way off my back about having to meet other people.  -Oh ok let me get off of that thing.  ~Also we’ll need someone from Earth to play a role in the video.  -Ok that’s way to far ~Yea yea yeah -I don’t think people would watch a video with someone from a whole other planet, let alone from a whole other universe, in it.  ~Oh -Yeah. And also how are we going to get to Earth? ~I don’t knooow -Fair enough.  ~*Proceeds to begin telling the script* -*Interrupts* Look I have no idea how this video is going to work.  ~Not having videos work is TIGHT -Wait that’s my line! ~Oh whoops  -Whoopsie ~Can I just tell you the script? -Umm...well...hmmm...well ok then  *A Script later*  ~So what do you think? -Yeah no , I don’t see this as a good video.  ~Oh my God -Yeah, there’s just like one Ryan in it, someone else from a different planet and universe, and there’s no green screen. I don’t think people will like that at all.             *The video proceeds to get thousands of likes in the first 30 minutes after the upload*
I just watched your divorce video Bhhahaha
It is nice to see the two pronunciations of gifts been used in unison like this.
You have similar number of subscribers! WOW, wow wow wow wow.....wow!
I want to wear all white bc it’s virginal!  Ryan: Well not entirely accurate, but okay...  LOL
😂😂😂😂😂 Real funny. This video is like something I didn't know I wanted. But damn. Saw it in my notifications and freaked out. Super awesome.
Hilarious! Love your content <3
You guys understand that people are now gonna ship you two together and make this thing weird right?
I'm pretty sure the bit about dress shopping is historically accurate 😅
This is a huge lore reveal in the Ryan George Extended Universe *(RGEU)* ,a person who isn't Ryan now exists, although this could be a noncanon anthology series, idk
Ooooh Marrying is tight
Julie Nolke and Ryan George in one video! Dreams do come true
Oh a double standard 😂😂😂😂
Avengers: We had  the ultimate crossover. Colabstronaut: Hold my Nolke.
Ryan don't do it!  She looks nothing like you!  Also...kinda out of your league.  I predict this will end badly.
The video on Ryan’s channel is exactly in the same spot
You two rock.
WowWowWowWow. Seeing the Ryanverse expand to another channel is TIGHT!
Love your videos
I am so glad you two did videos together. I love the content you both create and am glad to see you two in a video together!
When asked about changing the last name, should've said "It'll be super easy. Barely an inconvenience."
i just got married 5 days ago before watching this, it was a small covid 19 regulated wedding and did not have half the stuff you “normally” would. but it was amazing. this video was great
Ohh, double standards are TIGHT!  What else is tight? This team up. And the fact that you use subtitles!! 🥳 This is so helpful for people with hearing disabilities and foreign speakers. I've commented this to Ryan many times but maybe you could do me and the deaf kids I'm teaching a favor and ask him to add subtitles to his videos, too? After all, as his wife, you might have an influence. Or, if already divorced, he could get half of yours ;)  Checking out your channel now. Have a great day.
He is very handsome
Julie: So you have a wedding idea for me? Wedding Planner: Yes ma'am I do. And its going to cost a bunch of money and make you question if getting married is the right choice for you.      You know how the rest goes.
Collaboration prequels are TIGHT!
Getting engaged is super easy barely an inconvenience and getting married is tight
This marriage doesn’t go well 😂
Wtffff!!  🤣🤣🤣  the accuracy!!
Marriage doesn’t seem to be super easy, barely an inconvenience . . . I did it! I’m so clever . . . Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey!
Wow they only have a 1k subscriber difference.
Great video, Julie George
The people who retrieved the soccer ball out of the goal behind Ryan may have scored more than Julie or Ryan did throughout the duration of all of their suddenly proposed parties.
This is the only colab I wantef
Julie seems like herself but Ryan doesn't seems like his usual loud, brutally honest, calm guy who over explains stuff...  *SHE'S ALREADY CRUSHING HIM! SOMEONE HELP!*
I saw the divorce one first but luckily this was the top suggested so stating here coz first comes marriage.
Non topical comedy makes you feel the Orwellian dystopia we're stuck in.  Try something that isn't sociopathic so you can remain in good standing with the psychopaths oligarchs & their technocrats.  They didn't plan ahead.
Great way to start my day!!!
Awww, my two favorite weirdos/people in one spot! I love it! 😂😍👏😘
I don’t like seeing Ryan interact with people that aren’t Ryan
the double standard bit made me spit out my drink
❤
This won't last
your creativity for these videos is amazing, so much fun to watch these hahaha
There's another one?! omg! this day brings some redemption to the trainwreck of 2020)) greatest collab ever!
The level of genius creativity in writing this is amazing. The performance is just the cherry on the top. I'm waiting for a major network to give you what you deserve, a full fledged sitcom.
"Did we get the government involved in our relationship?" "Yeah yeah yeah!" "Whoops!" "Whoopsie!"
"It's non-negotiable, I don't know what to tell you."
Lv u Juli, Love your jacket too ! 😍
The negotiation makes the whole enterprise took shady.
These to need more collabs
Ohh shit I’m never getting married
This collab was long overdue. Did ALL the alter egos (pun intended) attend the wedding? 🤣
man. ryan is getting real good with the wigs and camera angles. I couldnt even tell he was just talking to himself. Very impressive
Virginal theme is tight.
Aaaaah😱😱..... bug in the matrix confirmed: Ryan talking to someone not Ryan 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Is a surprise colab the best thing about today? Hell yes it is.
How the heck did you manage to have kids?
Everyone: So how did the wedding go? Ryan: It was super easy barely an inconvenience.  Everyone: So how did the divorce go? Ryan: Ya, I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about that.
Yoo, such a brilliantly written skit! 😍
He talks to himself? I thought he was just, like, quintuplets or some such.  My whole world view is altered.
Wow, look what appeared in my subscriptions feed: a sketch of the youtuber who talks to herself in sketches with another youtuber who talks to himself in sketches! And here’s one more! What a day!
Oh so you guys existed in the same universe all along.
just go to a judge
If communication in relationships were so straight foward
What's going on right there why is there more than 1 person
My 2 favorite sketch comedians collabing. I love it. Also I just got married on 9/25 so, this really hits home for me.
Hello, popping over here from Ryan George. It’s curious how your subscriber counts are so very very close.
So you have a wedding for me? Yes Sir, we do.
Watching this after Ryan's video is really funny. I like how they both played perfectly in how the other's video's go.
So this is how it happened
I’VE BEEN CALLING THIS COLLAB SINCE DAY 1
This was a weird pitch meeting. Screenwriter guy looked like a female.
ryan george brought me here.
What is this a crossover episode?
Ryan sent me....
Best collab in history!
I lost it at autumnal forest
You are two of my favorite comic artists!
this was hilariously sarcastic I love it.
“Well, it’s virginal” “That’s not entirely accurate” 😂 Ryan, you don’t kiss and tell 😂
To be honest, I’ve been a fan of both of you and I even tweeted or commented somewhere that you both should collab.  But, I think you both are far better in your individual videos. This just did not work for me! :/
Omg!!!! 💕💕💕 Two of my favorite youtube personalities!!! Eeeeee!!!!
I will never see Ryan as not in a sketch. Like, if I see him in the street I'll just assume there's a camera somewhere
Wow. wow wow wow
2:57 "double standard" my thoughts exactly. Especially coming from a country where the women keep their last names and the children get both the dad's last name and the mom's last name.
"oh it's a double standard. got it. okay." lol
Wait wait wait.... the husband is meant to remove the garter belt in-front of all the guests? I had to take one off my mates wife at their wedding with my mouth because i lost some stupid game (or won? I felt like I lost anyway)
Wait is Ryan Canadian too?
R: Fun for who?!  J: EVERYONE!  R: .....mmm....  😂😂😂
"Well how will they know you mine‽" "oh...it'll be super easy..."
Julie: Changing the last name?  Sounds hard. Ryan: Actually.....it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience. Julie: I feel like you're saying that because you don't have to change your name at all. Ryan: Yeah yeah yeah!
he talk to him self? ok that guy is crazy
OOOO getting married is TIGHT, on a side note, I feel like a harpoon would be a great wedding gift. 😉
When two GIANTS collide.
Best collab ever, both their humours are great but mixed like this, the realistic nihalism of ryan and the second hand embarrasment of julie, it’s transcendent
This is a YouTube dream come true!
Marry Ryan and I'll officiate the wedding dresses as darth vader and instead of "here comes the bride" you'll walk to the imperial march
The crossover episode we didn't know we needed
Getting married and divorced within an hour, a new record
When I was a kid I used to think that when people get divorced they do the wedding  in reverse.
Can you two get for-reals married please? The world needs more uproariously funny people with impeccable timing nuance.
My two favorite Canadian sketch comedians who talk to themselves collabing on videos together? BEST. DAY. EVER.
I though I was watching This on Ryan George’s channel. This is still goo thi
One of the best ones
I wish your face look like Ryan's
Oh my god! This is two of my worlds colliding right here. Nolke and George together at last! Please stay married and make a lot of beautiful beautiful content together.
Collabs with my 2 favourite youtubers are tight!
I like the person behind Ryan setting up the soccer goal.
Hahahhah....this was awesome ♥️
Y'all are my two favourite YouTubers. Thank you for collabing! This makes me so happy!
I LOVE LVOE LOVE
Dude, this was incredible!
Am I dreaming? I've been wanting this pairing for awhile.
The passive aggressiveness of this wedding planning is basically fantastic. I am looking forward to the prenup conversation.
Getting married is Tight!
They'd have such pretty babies....
Lo
Julie: I'm going to need you to get all the way off of my back Ryan: except on the wedding night I would assume Julie: Yeah I guess that'll be okay
Wow this is like the biggest crossover event I have ever seen. and you guys even uploaded it together? Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
Now this is the collab we were waiting for.
2:59 Well, alright then!
Two of my favorite YouTubers together in one video.   Great work.
WORLDS COLLIDE. LOVE THIS COLLAB. Is Ryan based out of Toronto too?
My two favorites did a collab??!! I’m in. But I’m definitely not going to hang out with your corpse.
Super easy, barely an inconvenience
Lol they got married on this channel  And divorced on Ryan George’s channel
The most ambitious crossover in YouTube history
I think you 2 just broke the rules of the Ryan-verse and probably the Julie-verse as well (if fans are calling them that).
This is the collab of the century
Ryan George is BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!
Your former companion is hot.
Part 1: first marriage Part 2: first divorce Part 3: first date
Great! I love you both!
Marriage is Tight.
I'm so happy seeing the two of you in a single video
Georgeeeeee
See guys, 2020 really does have some great moments in it. Not only did I discover Julie Nolke but she collabed with another YouTube fav! Things are looking up!
I feel like i really should have seen this colab coming
Watching as a single person......think I'll just stay this way and stay living alone 😂
Watching a video with two of my favorite YouTubers is TIGHT!
Two Youtube Comedy legends turn out to both be from the same city as me and they collab?! this was a nice to start to the day :)
Oh Canada! Our home and native land!
AAAAAAAHHH
It was cute when Ryan was initially excited about the Big Shower and taking the Garter off until Julie explained further.
The crossover I always wanted for the last two months
they divorced in other video😭😭😜
I can't decide if this was weird, or very fitting. I'm so used to seeing you two talk to yourselves, so now I'm really unsure about how to feel about you talking to each other...
OMG! My two favorite YouTube comedians are doing crossover!
Been waiting for this crossover
Who is this female Ryan? And why do I feel compelled to subscribe to this female Ryan?
_"Well, somehow that sounds a little shady, but I'm into it."_ I say that about most things in life.  👍
Please collab on more videos!!
The coolest collab does not exi— Julie and Ryan: Hold my beer
Julie looks kinda different... Did she grow a beard or something?
Getting married is sooooo easy.. 😂
I was always hoping you two kids would get together...    For a Collab.
Ultimate Youtube comedy power couple!  Please do more!
BEST CROSS OVER EVER!
Julie... Ryan... these two vids are great and I hereby demand future collaborations. I have spoken.
does a backflip snap the bad guy's neck and save the day..
Seeing Ryan talking to someone else is weird and the lack of green screen background is even weirder
Who knew we owe our not having to shop with women for wedding dresses to Ryan. We salute you. ✊
LOL! I love you Julie! Your videos are amazing! =)
It was super easy barely an inconvenience for me to find your channel..... Bring me Thanos and moor videos thumbs up thank you.
Congra for reaching 6k followers.
my timing is terrible, someone i saw the divorce before the wedding. On the bright side, im sure the kids will be fine with it
Ok I have to know, how long have you guys known each other for? Because I love both you guys. Also, everyone needs to watch Ryan's pitch meetings
I feel like this marriage isn't going to work out. Just a hunch
My favorite youtubers in the same video! My cup runneth over!
Jesus Christ I have been asking for this for quite a while!
Imagine this comment being liked
I don’t know what he sees in her. Long hair, no beard, various round bits. I don’t see this working out, but I think it will take a lot of paperwork to undo.
Who is she she seem funny
Not the collab we expected, but the collab we needed. Thank you Julie, you never cease to put a smile on my face
Congrats Julie for reaching 600k subs! It was like a month ago when you hit 500k 😱
"I might lick whipped cream off a guy with a 6 pack" "What?" 🤣🤣🤣
I’m waiting for the video reveal that Ryan isn’t real and was just a character played by Julie this whole time
Great video, I hope these guys never get divorced.
You forgot the honeymoon.  LMAO - really enjoyed this - what a great way to start my day. I hope the happy couple has a long and , oh wait... [ sees link to the next video] Yeah, never mind. I hope it was good at least for awhile. 😂 Off to see the First Couple To Ever Get Divorced...see you all there!
I always hoped these two would find there way together.
Getting married is TIGHT! later who knows
If this were an indian wedding the misogyny would be so direct that youtube would take it down.
My 2 favorite youtubers collab! Best day ever! Also, kinda trippy.
Omg this team up is amazing!!! I didn't know I needed this today.
Two videos in one day married and Divorce
Other Ryan and Mirror Julie are still together, though.
"lickin' whipped cream off a guy with a six-pack" ... you haven't been doin' research on the 'shady side of the street,' have 'ya Juls??? .... Bart
Can you imagine I got notification from julie and Ryan at the same time and the title is the same  edit  almost same cause I checked her vid too
my world just crumbled... i watch both of their vids and i was like is she the female version of Ryan or is he the male version of Julie
This is f*ing genius!!!! What a match!! She should pitch him a movie with a woman traveling back in time to tell her younger version about corona virus which changes the whole world because of the butterfly effect you know.
I already wrote the comment that I could think of under Ryan's video, so here's this comment as a placeholder until I think of something else witty. For the algorithm!
Whoooooo!!! Crossover!!
Omg... haven't even watched it yet, but this is a collab might be the best thing of 2020. (Possible the only good thing of 2020, come to think of it :D )
Just saw the video on ryans channel. You are two of my favorite you tubers!:)
And then he did a backflip, snapped the bad guy’s neck and saved the day.
yayyyy
So was this before "the first guy to ever make a friend" (where Ryan kept mentioning the bear)?
Best Crossover in History??
The Crossover we didn't deserve, but the crossover that we needed.
Talk about triggering a PTSD episode. Especially watching the divorce video right after.
'well we could make a list'  'oh I'm *list*ening'   omg that cracked me up good time looool
I came here because of Ryan. Nice one.
Ryan George sent me here.
Oh it's a double standard 😂
Oh hey, what if you guyz got divorced huh?
Vow vow vow... vow.
Me: was this video hard to make? Ryan : Super easy, barely an inconvenience  ;-)
Great collab
I wish proposing was this simple...it looked super easy barely uninconvenienc
Not talking to yourself is TIGHT
Wait, there is other person in Ryan's World?
I liked it
I never been to a western wedding, so..Wow, this is eye opening.
Seeing people getting married is tight
are we invited?
Julie: So you've got a colab for me Ryan: Yes mam I do. Julie: Do you think people are gonna say we are the same person. Ryan: Yes sir I do.  Ryan: Oh wow wow wow
I saw them backwards I think... Jajaja
And then he did a backflip, break her neck and saved the day.
I think it goes without saying, but just to clarify, this is hilarious!
I like this Julie Nolke Ryan George combination
Both videos are great! 👍
He was fired from screen rant.
So good. Julie I watch your stuff daily and share them often. I truly enjoy your humor and think your clips are awesome. KEEP GOING YOU TOTALLY SHOULD BE ON A MOVIE OR HAVE YOUR OWN SHOW!!!! Even your name is cool. STAY GOLD!!!
The crossover I didn’t know I needed!
How was this not R-rated
A colab between those two is tight!
Hey why you down there broke me
As a fan of both your channels, this collab is a dream come true. Thank you both!
It's getting harder and harder for me to notice that Ryan plays all the roles.
Not seeing Ryan in front of a green screen is so bizarre
Thanks for making 2020 alot more bearable Jules, yr a legend of a legend which is pretty legendary 😂 ♥
I'm surprised you didn't bring up the strange tradition of throwing a bouquet of flowers into a crowd.
I ship it. Other Ryan will probably be very jealous though.
Hells yeah, two of my favorite youtubers.
What? No. Yes. You two are my favorite! So glad to see you work together!!!
Oh oh it’s a double standard. Ok. 😂😂😂
This is the greatest day in the history of YouTube.
I've seen parks and recreation, genital candies from bridal showers are convenient gardening tools
His style somehow really fits on your channel.
Wow! Pure genius. This is exactly how it is. I've been married three times, Im 39 now...there wont be a fourth Lol
Ick this is reminding me how much i hate weddings
Imagine a world where all the men look like Ryan George and all the women look like Julie Nolke.  That would be really strange. Every conversation would be a YouTube video. Every meeting would be a pitch meeting.
First time hearing about you but I'm subbed
you're both amazing!
I came here from the divorce one
Both videos were very funny. You two should do more together.
Marriage is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Brilliant...hilarious...wait till he meets mirror Julie...might be a deal breaker lol
Hey wait a minute. You look nothing like George. Which universe is this?
We couldn't possibly refuse a request from the Collabstronaut. Subscribed!
My two favorite YouTubers??  What is this, heaven?
well sequel is sad
And they said that Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover event in history
I feel like there's a lot of untapped video potential for things couples do between you two. Like ... Kids. Or weird dating conventions
Well it only lasted twenty minutes
That was greaaat
Wow u guys married and divorce in a matter of 5 mins
Wait... Is Julie from Quebec too?
Yes! The collab of the year!
strange to see ryan with a real background. it seems fake
....and then, they break up. 😓
Marriages are tight
Just like where he's talking to himself.    Look mirror Julie, its a lot more complicated than that ok!
Marriage is easy, hardly an inconvenience.
watched the ryan video before coming here, got me thinking, what other comedy youtube person talks to themselves in skits can you collab with?
LOVE Ryan
man I'm so sure these crazy kids are gonna make it! I bet they'll always wanna keep looking at each other's stupid faces and won't get annoyed by stuff like how they brush their teeth :)
been waiting for this collab
It's finally happening! Julyan! Ryie?
She looks the girl who explained 2020's event to her past self
Early congrats on 600k!!! Hollywood is going to find you, don’t worry about a thing. SNL starring Julie Nolke🤷‍♂️
Well, this is awkward. I watched the Divorce video first, so I already know how this ends.
3:29 is someone getting kidnapped in the background??!
funny as always!
Hi there hello! I've been watching both of your channels for awhile now, so when I saw you two did a collab I squealed with joy and now everyone in my office is concerned about me.
Hey that's that movie guy   You got a rom com for me   Wow wow wow . Wow
Bro as an Asian, some of these wedding stuff sound really weird like that hyper sexual bachelorette things or taking bride's garter off with mouth in front of all these people! What the hell guys!!
Julie saying some of Ryan's catchphrases would have been gold xD
Wow wow wow wow wow
When you’re already saw the divorce video...so you know the result
My dream came true! My favorite youtube sketch comedians together ❤️ loved it
Sweet, nice collab.
Really sad that people think Ryan doesn't talk to other people other than himself
I N G E N I O U S
I was tying my shoe :D  Ryan is gold
A party before the party before the party..
Who’s here because Ryan sent you? Me! And glad he did!
ok, but the guy in the background at 2:36 just made the whole situation funnier, like it was a real couple debating in a sunny day
The accuracy of this is both scary and depressing.  Well done!
Julie! The only reason I have ever hit the notification bell. I see a red notification I know it’s time to smile :)  Thanks a million!!!!
Two of my faves! awesome!
Badges would've been awesome! 😂😂
omg this is amazing
No. No. Ryan should have been his own wife.
Cross-over!!#J!Pj@$p@{P@{@r{WRR weeeeweeweeeeee yayayayayayaya
I am so emotionally torn right now. I mean, marriage and divorce on the same day, watched in the wrong order. It is taxing.   Also, I feel a bit dirty. I have watched Ryan a lot - and I feel like I am cheating on this dude he is usually collaborating with (I wonder if they are brothers, but he is also Studio Guy and I can not imagine Ryan getting into that sort of nepotism)  And yet it was beautiful to watch the emotional beauty of two individuals falling helplessly in love. So romantic. It looked so easy and lacking almost any inconvenience (maybe except that garter thing in public....that is not a convenient way of helping out with clothes).   If you ever figure out that this marriage thing was a bad idea - Ryan keeps the cat. He was the first person who owned a cat. The cat stays with him, young lady.
Two people who talk to themselves almost exclusively  Sounds like a real perfect match
Only recently heard about that garter thing! Not sure what happened there North america... The middle ages of ripping a bride out of her wedding dress are behind most of us? And what's with the ties on the head?
OMG I love this. Yes, more of this.
People: Endgame is the most ambitious crossover in history  Ryan George and Julia Nolke: Hold our beer
Love the collab with Ryan George! Please do more videos together!
Should you also implement throwing the flower bouquet so that one of your female friends know when they are going to get married, or is it too soon? I mean, that would make her part of the second couple ever getting married.
Just came after Ryan sketch, nice one too
Ryan has a better chemistry with him self then her which I’m not surprised of this guy has made of career by speaking to himself so yeah
Ummmm my two fave Canadian comedians...
I've said that over there and I will say it here - I love both of you so I'm quite happy with the collab. Can't subcribe to more channels though, bc I was subscribed to both of yours.
I'm running to see Ryan's video. Back in a minute, or six, I don't know.
This has been an emotional rollercoaster of a morning
As a long time fan of both of these two, this feels like watching the Avengers for the first time.
I think the lower view count of this video is mostly due to Ryan’s thumbnail game. YouTube thumbnails suck, but they’re an important part of the game. Julie chose a more boring shot (in terms of facial expressions) and didn’t add any text. Her video looks “classier” but isn’t as good at grabbing eyeballs.  Both videos were still instaclicks for me. I hope these two keep finding all kinds of success; they deserve it for being rare sources of real creativity.
julie is the second ever character introduced into the ryanverse and i am here for it. its the collab that always needed to happen.
Jesus just get married for real already =.=
That double standard line was too funny to be fair on... just, ANYBODY.
Makes sense to me
Why some people don’t like this , I don’t get it 🙈🙈
oh shit is that the dude from the movie thing?
Fine play! I like the Ryan's outfit, I have the same kind of Jacket.
Lmao she's a female version of Ryan!
So, you have a wedding for me?  Yes sir I do.
The first woman to ever give birth.
BEST. CROSSOVER. EPISODE. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want to say this is tight im expecting this first video with ryan wearing a wig but i will be going to get off on their back because of details ooppsy
The two people I'm used to seeing talking to themselves, talking to each other.  2020 finally jumped the shark.
Video's in YouTube membership section: I see a thumbnail with Julie and Ryan. I see another thumbnail with Julie and Ryan. Wait what?
This is too accurate.
YES! I've been waiting for this collaboration!
Great video, you skipped the rehearsel dinner tho
Ryan isn't not talking to Ryan.....my reality has shattered...
I ship them.
The only Non-Negotiable I gave my future Misses was NO Mushroom Appetizers! (I don't like mushrooms!)
Yeah, hey Julie, heard you got that drip, drip, drip, drip Yeah, something for my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist Paparazzi sound like flick, flick, flick, flick  idk why I never thought of this before
I love this collab😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ryan has talked about being super awkward in person. I wonder if this was awkward to film or if they along 🤔
They 'll forgive !
Why does Julie look like a female Eminem?
I ship :v
Freaking brilliant, just brilliant
He's the character from that video!
Also, Julie should absolutely be in a Pitch  Meeting video. Maybe that would be too hard to pull off.
This is good considering there is only one Ryan.
both of your videos popped up in notification and I was confused
I'm having a hard time figuring out who wrote the scripts... the divorce video is pure cringfest which suggests nolke wrote it. This one... I felt like it tarted out more ryan george-y... but then.... wtf was that about making another family while the husbands in a coma? Helloooooo.... the premise is, this is the first couple to ever get married... which implies the first couple to make a family.... I mean, i realise you can make a family without getting married, but considering how related the 2 concepts are... totally destroys the suspension of disbelief.... That line... as well as the half assed attempts at describing bachelor parties.... This video feels like ryan george wrote it but was incresdibly lazy or rushed... like he wrote the script in 20 minute before filming or whatever. I mean seriously, no attempt at being more... idk, realistic is a ridiculous word in this context, but in other videos "the frist person to do X" , ryan george actually start from a resonable premise. Likethe first person to have ahome... the other character implied everyone was living in caves. Makes sense. But this? I would have expected something more like "hey, since it takes so much work to take of those kids, and we like those kids so we want them to feel good, let's work together on those kids; - but it will take YEARS for them to grow up, we'll be old and unattractive when they grow up; i mean... nobody else will want to have sex with us when we're old and ugly; - yeah you're right; let's just make it official: we'll stay together... forever. Well, until we die". THAT is the kind of writing i epect from a ryan george script - a bit of social commentary. If in fact THIS video was written by nolke, then i cannot for the life of me imagine how ryan george could make the snooze fest that is the first couple to get divorced video. Or maybe both were written by nolke, but then wtf kind of colab is that?
I hit like before watching video! I trust Julie Nolke!
First couple to get married is also the first couple to get divorced?   Yeah… that tracks.
And then, the couple did a backflip, snapped the bad guy’s neck, and saved the day
Man, Julie is really good at being two completely different people at once, as always.
The only couple to get divorced one minute before they got married lol
Just wait till the reveal that this was part of Mirror Julie’s backstory.
Ahahahah very fine ..
Make a First person to ever cheat on their partner with Ryan.
lolololol !!!!!
Seeing Ryan George interacting with anyone that’s not himself makes me uncomfortable
This is great!!!
And people say Ryan is a clone
YAAAAAYY.....MY 2 FAVOURITE YOUTUBERS IN ONE VIDEO TWICE IN ONE DAY!!!!!!
Ive never noticed how good those two get together. Like in a humourous sense.
Finally you made a video together, I was begging for it for a very long time due I follow you both. You're awesome!
Next video " the first couple to get re-married and then divorced"

I definetly love this crossover! Who would've thought Julie would Marry the adstronaut
Getting married sounds like it would be super easy, barely an inconvenience
Omg my 2 favourite Youtubers in one video!!!
That was phenomenal. Having been through the whole marital cycle, I am fit to judge.
"Oh yeh its like a double standard yeh" That killed me🤣🤣
Now you have to do the first couple to tell their kids about divorce
OMG this is the collaboration I've been looking forward to this whole year!
The perfect crossover doesn't exi-
This made my day ... two of my faves together in one video ! This is like the avengers of comedy stuff on YouTube for me lol
I love both of your comedy sketches. And somehow I think you make each other funnier. Great comedy chemistry. More please. This is the birth of a comedy duo.
This is magic
Matching tracksuit‘s.
Two of my favorites combined for maximum awesomeness!!
Since you do Ryan like comedy then I will subscribe to you because it's super easy barely ... you know the rest ;)
These are GREAT! Thank you 😭
Ryan and Julie in the same video is tight! Wow! Wow wow wow!

This Collab is Tight!
YES AMAZING PAIRING
seriously..... the RGEU is broken xD (i call it extended universe, sue me  :V)
The Ryanverse is expanding
Just for the record. I think she's attractive in this one.
this is a prequel to ryan's
Julie next year I will be in Canada or USA, omg I can't believe that I will come very close to you😊, your biggest fan 😉
so this is amazing
I wasn’t expecting to see a Ryan George Leg reveal
I don't wanna get married, but matching track suits could be a game changer...
Funny enough they both look like they could be an actual couple
This marriage isn't gonna last. I can feel it.
Ohhh this is gold! Maybe do... first couple to ever to throw a baby shower, first couple ever to do a gender reveal party, first couple ever to renew their vows... I have so many ideas!!
Ryan send me on this video it was super easy barely a inconvenience
I see Ryan George I immediately click
getting married and divorced in the same day is tight!
This colab was super easy to enjoy barely a inconvenience
Makes perfect sense to me!! 👰🏻 🤵 💍
I never knew I needed this cross over
Getting divorced and married on the same day is Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience
Well , she is adorable 😌
"I'm swept up in the moment let's do this"...so accurate then they regret it later
02:57 Oh its a double standard..ok..i get it🤣
The collab I’ve been waiting for!!
This is a match made in pointing out the awkward.
My 2 fav canadians unite in this crossover episode. Perfect match
The collab we never new we wanted
And so they will join forces and take on the cast of letterkenny in a battle for Canadian supremacy !
OMG! This was so funny I loved it!!! Oh by the way you two would have beautiful children..😊👍🥰🙏🏻
All my dreams came true in 4 minutes
I've wanted this since I discovered both of you, this is tIGHT!
Good calab!   It would be interesting if these two actually became a couple?  Nawww
I've been waiting for this crossover!!!
It’s weird to see Ryan. That’s it, nothing else, bye.
Man never knew how absurd a wedding sounds
Marrying is tight
Noone else is freaking out that Ryan has legs?
Are we absolutely 110% sure Julie isn't actually Ryan?
I am so happy cus I love both channels.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is amazing! I love you both!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Awesome to see you guys working together. Hilarious!
Wow two of my favourite YouTubers in one video!
You guys are frakin' made for each other and should actually get married  More!
the crossover we didn't know we needed
WORLDS COLLIDE!
The collab I didn't know I needed
Omg best collab ever
Why is she not Ryan?!
The collab we didn't know we wanted badly. Great stuff. More plz.
Hey hey! That’s the dude, the guy,,, from the other thing! I loved that thing
My two favorite youtbubers together Love It!!!
Legends say that Julie like comment that dare her to like them. So......    I dare u not to like my comment, Julie
It was so weird, because i first saw Ryan divorcing some unknown woman that wasn't himself, and just now i understand what's going on. It's like watching star wars all over again in that wacky original order
So is Ryan Canadian too?
Getting married is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Getting married is super easy, barely and inconvenience!
We never knew we needed this.
Julie and Ryan in one video!!! This is officially my favourite video on the internet... Haven't even started watching it yet, I just know. ❤️
The shortest lasting relationship
" And then she did a backflip, snapped the bad guy's neck and saved the day!"
OMG 2 funniest people ever collab! Is 2020 over??
Gongratulations, guys!
Ryan and Julie?  Okay, I'm in
The girl at 2:35 has not yet learned the "pull the net" trick yet.  Dude at 2:51 on the other hand...
Okay I'm confuse, so ryan has two channels now? 🤔
Let's br honest guys she is pretty good at these videos  And is as talented as him keep ip the good content 👍👍
This is a crossover I didnt even know I wanted but its great!
This is a bigger crossover than MCU and DC
My question for Julie is... how did you get the beard to look so realistic? It totally changed the shape of your entire face.  Lol. Actually... it kinda made you look a bit like Ryan George.  Or did you do that in post-production?
You guys! You got married! That's so sweet.  Lemme hop over to Ryan's channel to see if he posted the wedding  video..          Oh no.🥺
Julie Nolkie and Ryan George collaboration? IS THIS GOLD OR IS THIS GOLD
We should switch to matching track suits instead of rings.
Shortest YouTuber marriage yet...
This marriage lasted a whole video, how’d that happen
Canadian Crossover!!!
Image having a casual conversation with a friend and bamm... you are married and bammm again... u  had kids bammm bamm bammm u r divorced, thank u for your time.
I would marry Julie then divorce her just to get my hands on that jacket.
Ab-so-lute-ly brilliant!
Love Ryan's Jacket.
When Julie mentioned shower with potential wedding guests, my mind went in a totally different direction. Why would you have an orgy with a wedding guest?
This is the greatest crossover event of all time 😂😂😂😂
You're the perfect foil for Ryan (and vice versa, of course).  Nicely played, Julie.
This is one of my favourite sketches of yours! sending love <3
Arbitrary relationship rituals are tight.
Ohhhh I get it now 😉
BEST CROSSOVER EVER. How did you ever choose between all the Ryans? They all have very similar qualities.
Is everyone here for Ryan or what? Cuz I surely am
No way, two of the funniest people on YouTube in a video together.  This is exciting!
When you see the divorce before the wedding
Wow. This might probably be the sequel for The Proposal. Lol.😎
THIS UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING!!!!!
The wait is finally over and it was SOOOOOO worth it!  Great job.  You two should do more videos together.
I already subscribe to both of you. I was initially a little confused. I'm simple like that. Great collab.
THE COLLAB HAS HAPPENED
Female Ryan looks even more gorgeous than usually on this sketch
Definitely never expected the two YouTubers that I have the most fun watching lately collaborating out of the blue! :O
If I had to watch an hour of this bit it would be super easy, barely an inconvenience ❤️❤️❤️
Okay, maybe 2020 isn't all bad!
Your fans: So how will this marriage work out?  Julie & Ryan: We don' knooow!
Your a very funny girl. Well acted by both of you and terrific script.
Getting married is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Crossover!!!!
Oh my god... GUYS... GUYS IT'S HAPPENING!!
The most unexpected crossover that I didn't know I needed.
Haha, man all the 'wedding traditions'...when you put it like that it does sound shady! 🤣 Also the white dress thing came from the time when only the rich could wear white (cuz they were the only ones who could afford it) and it was a status symbol as it was a completely impractical thing to have a garment you could only wear once. Plus weddings were/are *expensive*
I'm here because of Ryan George.
Making lists of stuff we want is tight!
I love that he keeps bringing up the shower lol
A crossover we’ve all needed.
hahah great
I’m not getting married😩😩 Who’s paying for all of this????
This is amazing-
There are two of you. This is a great day. Subscribing
OMG you look gorgeous at the end of the video. No make up?
How do their personalities mesh so well together?
Don't ship Ryan and Julie. DON'T SHIP RYAN AND JULIE
THE COLLAB IVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!! 😍🥰❤️
So did you got divorced on the same date of is it like 5 William years or something
What Ryan and Julie this is truly an epic morning
Getting married this weekend and this all feels way too relatable
I LOVE these two together in a video.  Bravo! More! More!
3:06 - 3:12 What the Hell, I didn't know that, it means I can get rid of corpse now.
" How do they know that you're mine?" "Oh there's no need for that" Lmao Whoops Whoopsies
It’s so sad that they’ll end up getting divorced😢
So this is how this wedding madness started? Interesting.... 🤔
Dammn, I predicted this..sorta
Hey it's Ryan!
Julie another great video in the Julie zone, like twilight in the land of marriage. Thanks for sharing your life and times with us that watch your channel
Julie George does have an interesting ring to it
Julie : thank you for making a video with me  Ryan : actually it's super easy barely an inconvenience 😂
You have rendered proposals to be cringeworthy🤣🤣
Wow getting married is tight
Love love love!
Ha I watched the 2 videos out of order. Now it's like they got back together :)
I was expecting him to say "Super easy, barely an inconvenience!" somewhere in between 😂😂
Best duo ever!  The first couple to get married and divorced in the same exact moment 😂
If only it was this easy...
Omg amazing collab🔥
Has anyone ever told you that you look like Betty gilpin ?? It's so cool, anyway. Great video as usual !! Xoxo
Wait this isn't normal the world is out of balance Julie isn't talking to a mirror and Ryan isn't talking to himself WHAT'S GOING ON
I bet her name is Marri and he's Ed   😏

He's got some gorgeous eyes!
OMG! I haven't even watched and I already know how awesome and TIGHT this will be!
I love you guys
This marriage won't last long ..trust me
“Endgame is the most ambitious crossover ever” Me:
Name change in Quebec, Canada is not allowed. Female have to keep their names.
So weird to see you in a Ryan George sketch, he usually does this sort of things.....Still awesomme seeing you two togheter in this !!!
Lists are tight!

Wait... Julie and Ryan are from the same Cinematic Universe? Mind blown!

Aww... They make a cute couple.
This crossover is amazing!
Ryan George sent me here.

That proposal was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Getting married is TIGHT!
Now this is a crossover

Never knew that the first couples would be that pre-planned for a thing which they have never experienced 😅 Btw, it was funny nevertheless 😂 and a bit awkward..
I've known this would happen for Some time.   Maybe we can get the pitch meeting for the sketch??
Oh, another Julie video!! Sweet!! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

This collab is a Dr. Stone reference.
Getting married is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This was the quickest marriage ever  spoiler it only lasted 5 minutes
Oh shit what a colab.
It's weird seeing Ryan talking to someone who isn't himself.
Sounds like a blast. Who wouldn't want to do all of this?
The crossover we never knew we needed!
03:29 is people from the future haunting on them for all the mess they created.
We coud make a list Oh, I'm listening  I laughed way too hard at this 😂

Wait a minute pitch meeting guy
Greatest crossover ever
LOL the accuracy of weird wedding traditions in full force with this one 👌🏼  Just missed the bit where the girl not only takes the last name but also is the only one wearing a ring during the engagement 😅
I just realized how weird this whole "marriage" thing is

The crossover we never knew we needed
“Hello Julie at the moment of uploading your or my or our first comedy sketch. I’m Julie from the year 2020. Remember this moment. When the time comes, you’ll know what to do.”
