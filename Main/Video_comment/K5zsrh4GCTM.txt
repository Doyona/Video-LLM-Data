Its cringe when tvey saying WAKE UP
One day someone is gonna be convinced they're dreaming like Mal in Inception😬
Bro If I was high NIGGGA I would literally im talkin about LITERRALY pass out 😂😂😮😮😮
This boy life in he's own world.
Whispering “wake up” to a guy walking listening to his music is just a genius idea! 😂🤦‍♂️
Bro is so chill about it like nothing's happening
Now these pranks are funny.
😂😂😂
Exactly what that is. Stupid ass narcissistic types. Lol real funny.
Little f'n wannabe gang stalker! Try that with me You might get punched in your face! Domestic espionage.
Charlie Brown is going through this as we speak
I wanna prank somebody with this
Most casual boy in Ohio
😅
Man wants sleep, let him B
Right Now 😂😅
Finally. I think I would react just like this guy after watching so much crap  on YouTube. Just focusing on what I need to do and waiting for a camera to pop up
969
@evenOut do it in a hospital With doctor clothes
Wake up dady show 💀
This is how Inception went sideways and the person killed themselves
Jokes on all of you, I’m actually the one  in a coma, and this video is apart of my dream telling me to wake up. Your life is in my hands
That Iowa ice cream shirt gag can be bought at the world's biggest truck stop in Iowa 👍
😂
You bastards. 🤣 not ur finest skit
That kid was so high…
Cameraman: "Hurry up, my potion of invisibility is running out."
😂😂😂
I’m the 1000th comment
Yo
Plot twist: he is in a coma and we are all characters in his dream.
1,000
Decimating someone's entire fabric of reality. Awesome!!!!!

I'm afraid of someone doing that to me and me hurting them. I have lucid dreams and when I do it's hard to differ reality and dreams. I always get violent in lucid dreams for fun. I have had to do reality checks a few times and if I ever get it wrong my ass is in jail.
He probably can't hear you lol I would think I was tripping out tho
Weird thing is, a coma victim actually woke up because someone told him he was in a coma
30% of Americans clueless please wake up
You'll get someone killed out of shock 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dreamcore
Ha
"😅"
He said “DUDE”
Can you imagine this scenario high af 🥴
someone will believe that and she or him will be suicide
I love how he is not paying attention to them at ALL… no matter how many times they walk by 🤣🤣🤣
Futurama episode and the pranksters are all Lela.
I would be scared shitless
He must be high those is his reality lol
Do a I’m in your walls
The last please he says 🤣😇
I would rock them both.
Inception
Lol i random stop doing whatever im doing when im near a friend and just stare at them and tell them that
He has earphones he can't hear you
People overestimate how solid their perception of reality is.
This is crazy,  y All literally could mess up someone's mind even if you tell them later that it was a prank, shits crazy man
Wake up run run wake up
If I was high I’d literally die of a heart attack from that shit wtf 😭
Please join the squirrel army, I have posted a video on my channel and will upload more info later, please consider this, thank you
If I were stoned and this happened...fuck
No matter what I wouldn't care cuz I know its fake😐
Playing mind games with someone perception  is not the way to prank people
Do this to more people 😁
All y'all saying this is harmful, you guys are so godamn fragile it is incomprehensible to me.
He didn't hear any of that till the last guy...
I'm stronger
He is like right now😂😂😂😂😂
They gonna give him a panic attack 🤣
Oh god. If someone did this to me I’d break. I suffer with derealisation and disassociation and being told to wake up and that I’m dreaming is a really bad trigger for me. Please, don’t pull pranks like this on people you don’t know. You might drive them to the edge with something you thought was harmless. Stay safe lovelies 💕☺️
Imagine the dude having a mental break down hearing that- :/
please dont do this yall, people actually kill themselves because they think they're not in reality :( derealization is a thing and is serious
I'm sure if the whole day.. everyone you pass says wake up.. you will shit yourself midnight..
And there he gona really wake up
Wouldn't it be funny if he was schizophrenic and ended up taking his own life, that'd be so hilarious
anyone gonna sent this to a stream to a channel that starr park took over and that stream is totally gone? {i mean you cant do it bc it was shut down by someone}
These videos make me so paranoid
When i lived in toronto, a schitzo on queen street looked me in the eye and said to me as he walked past on the sidewalk "step into the REAL world" and just kept walking... it fucked me up for weeks
Redo the video again for this time get a young man that has no ear plugs in his ear that would makes it look more real
Terrible idea
this is similar to what i dreamed about for few days. Some random ramen eating dude shows up and then said wake up. And i woke ip immediately
Dude was wearing headphones, didn't even notice the other guys
i had a deja vu with this video
Time travel in the matrix
Wake up.... You... Yes you...
"Please"
This would scare me
Stupid people will fall for this.
Scary af lmao
You know. If these guys is me. I dont know. I'll search water and wash my face. 🤣
Hallo apa ada org indo di sini yg bisa jelasin, ga bisa bahasa inggris soalnya😂
He had headphones in and probably didn't even hear this whispering crazy man.
INCEPTION
He literally sees the camera
This jokes are so cruel
MORE PLEASE WAKE UP VIDEOS! ⏰️ ⏰️ ⏰️
You cant check what the time is in a dream. All you gotta do is look at your phone lmao
When I had no experience with marijuana, I consumed edible marijuana at a high potency. I started to have auditory hallucinations, It was usually some family member crying and screaming “ Wake up”. Or random characters. I didn’t have any idea how to control my increased sensitivity. I thought my heart was failing for four hours. Cause it was pounding, I knew I had to slow it down, but I didn’t know how to relax. Tangents were out of control. People were on billboards with grass, everything was billboards. I was fading in and out of reality. I was partly convinced that I was in a coma for about 1.5 weeks, I kept trying at school just in case I wasn’t dreaming it all. It worked out. Totally terrifying tho, but at least the window was down on the drive home cause it made me have closed eye hallucinations, of a plane on a stormy night that was flying freely.  This prank would’ve killed me at that moment.  🤣😂
He don't hear he have earphones
That’s trippy
that can quickly lead to a disaster
“You’re dreaming right now”  “ Right now”?? 😂😂😂😂
the wake up reminds me of Donnie Darko
Did he wake up at the end?
Trust me  I was slepping but i hear this and i waked up🙂
My confused ass would believe them
And you ruined it.
Ok
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This hilarious! These ppl will be going to a psychiatrist for many years to undo this one!
They should get ko
Wit kinda shit is this to do to somebody lol
This would scare me and I’d probably hit somebody in the fucking jaw lmaoo
Thanos snapped his fingers ( pause)  And he came back
All well and good until the poor guy has a psychotic break.
All 4 should walk at him at the end saying wake up
Next time do it on someone who's not wearing headphones
pLeAs
He is actualing a 6 ling. So is used to it
Worst Joke.
Things like this need a trigger warning still a cool vid
Whisper to someone who has earphones in that's gonna work
Ight this one a little dangerous
Creepy
I would’ve shi myself
You could’ve went further like getting billboards and subtle signs and maybe even figuring out his name and getting his mom to do weird things so he thinks it’s really a dream
I don't indrstand
This must be freaky as hell
2:24
This is what prank supose to be not over🙂
A AM U DEAD ALREADY FUCK YES
Poor dude
Great bgm  ... song's name please ?
Yo this could fuck someone up
This kid believed it. Lol
Inception intensfieiss
Please don't do this. You might accidently say that to someone who is actually suffering from paranoia and believes that everything is fake   You can ven imagine what's it's like, your friends your family your life, you question everything, and then some random stupid teen comes and says wake up.  I hope you and anyone who dies that goes to hell. For that I'll wish deeply
The dreamer: if its a dream would i be able to do this(punching the guy who said you’re in a comma)😂
I did this 15 years ago
I swear if you told a stoned dude that he was asleep you would fuck him up
He's got his ear pods in, he didn't hear any of it
Grab a brush and out a little makeup! This was a really cool idea.😊
Scary prank
No i don't want to wake up
Hahhaha bad day to smoke up before your walk
Song in the backround please??
After the 3rd wake up I would be shitting myself
Doing this to someone on acid 🤣🤣
I am the 197.000th Like!! (:
What a brillant way to fuck with someones mental health. I hope you told him it was a prank.
Me asking myself if it was a sign.......
Wake up joe
Weird
Find a person with anxiety and she or he gonna kill herself :( this is not funny :(
Проснись, проснись
We could be characters in someone’s dream
inception😱😱
NOPE
This would freak me out
Dude that aint even funny real talk......i bet the first thing that came to his mind was am dead smh.......
Inception got these guys
If i,m dreaming den your point is don’t matter
He probably couldn't hear anything until the last guy because of his ear buds...
Do twins ever have normal jobs or do they all just make the same "prank" videos on YT?
Do not do this shit with people they can commit suicide
Ma man was about believe and now thinking about this
Yep this would scare the ever loving crap outta me
Imagine if this guy had a disassociation disorder already and they forced him into a psychotic break 🤣
Whats the fact😐😐
Dude questioned his existence
This is like a scene from a movie
Pathetic video ever....
This would been so nice If the Person was high🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You were in Itachi's Genjutsu
That's uh kinda fucked up 😂
Wake up.. Kid: fuck off!
Great concept.  So poorly executed.. Couldve been funny
This shit ain't even funny, people could start thinking their getting insane
F I'm so dumb
He is having ipods ... 😭
🤣🤣🤣
Thats some serious LIMBO sh#t😟🤯
Y’all gonna scare a mentally unstable person. This isn’t even funny
Wait am i sleeping too
This was the best
The guy should have punched the prankster's nuts and should have said.. who is dreaming now idiot..
THESE ARE THE PRANKS THAT ARE DECENTLY FUNNY
It'a like the Happy Death day movie.
He just ascends
Just play Memento Mori from Lamb of God. He'll wake up
You have to do so much more than that. You need to put signs up you need to write it on a piece a paper walk by and drop it. Have someone else walk talking to someone and in the convo mention the coma and waking up and even more then that would seriously mess with someone’s head
Hidup ini seperti mimpi tapi tak seindah mimpi
Find someone who you know thats been smoking marijuana and you’ll get the best reaction 😂😂😂😂
Fake.  Mans is clearly awake.  You can't film somebody in their dreams...unless I'm watching this in my own dreams?  No that's impossible.  I can never see my phone in my dreams.  I can see it now.  This is real.
He be like : am I the fool here
Yes sometimes when iam walking I feel like iam dreaming watching others....taking walking it feels like I'm in dream
He might be meditating
https://youtu.be/xyVOzGB_lrQ
"shiiit" man now asking himself if everythings real rn
" oh so if I stab you to death there isn't any consequences cool"  " wait no"
Do this to somebody off acid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My dude looking so confused 🤣🤣
What if he jumps into the road and get hit by a car to wake up right after that?
The kid being fake pranked was just in the last video I saw pranking somebody else with the guy that told him to wake up.    Maybe people need to wake up and block this channel.
Why did he look around!!!😂😂😂😂🤦🏿‍♂️
Not funny 👎
the "wake up" was a voice over. what they were really saying was "ignore the camera"
plottwist he doesn't even hear them the whole time because he wearing EarPods
Haha
Not funny..
Imagine hes going home to tell his mom about the weird strangers and she says wake up
He’s smiling but underneath all that he’s sweating intensely
Ah yeas he definitely heard them through his fake headphones
What if he actually wakes up...
it's like fuck it then, it's a dream lol and he commits multiple hate crimes.
This would mess with my head 😂
“Robs the bank thinking he’s dreaming”
What a fucking chad
So if I robb you right now I won't get into trouble!!
This is literally the definition of gaslighting
just imagine he hears this and he's just like "BET" and then he strips naked and runs around town
How far cry missins be
It didn't work because he's got his headphones in. He didn't hear them
While he has earbuds in
Ha ha the dude looked around when you said he was dreaming
He goes on to purposely fail his test because he thought he was sleeping
I just saw these videos and gotta tell you its been tripy mane!
Great idea doooo moree
Worse joke
What if real life is worse or bad when waking up
My man stole it from howaboutbeirut!!!
This is what pranks are nowadays?
Fuck, hhh you just mess up with his mind leave the dude
How fake u want this to be  Plase wake up
Why does the Wake up sound so edited in
Am about to go to amazon job and i keep hearing wakeup while i am dozing off watching YT shorts
Not funny .
You wanna all get socked in the face? Cuz you do some shit like that to me it's gonna be bad. Go get a job you hosers
Cute reaction "dude"
Don't fking so this. There is actually a mental issue where PPL believe they are dreaming and end up committing suicide because they think only then they can wake up.
It somebody did this to me it'd put me 12yrs back in therapy.
They made his whole life a lie.
Tf is this
Huh
Shout outs for the cameraman for using his last invisibility potion to help this man film this video
This is SO MUCH like what my bf and I would do in high school! 😂😂😂
why do he do dat wonky walkie
He didn't buy it 😂
When it back fires and the person strips naked and runs away yelling "I can do anything"
Then, tell them that, "They're coming."
What if he believes and starts jerking infront of other people
Your dreaming - He looks around for confirmation hahah
He is using headphone wtf..
Nak anj
And since then the dude is an overthinker
Hes got head phones on... How fake does this gotta be?
Good way to get punched in the face
I think this isn’t fair what if you come up to someone with an actual coma who didn’t even get passed the idea that he did wake up its really not cool bro stop playing with people’s brains
Fuuuuuck.....
This guy is chuunybyou 🗿
Cringe
Wake up you're dreaming.  Nah bruh I'm just really high. But thanks anyway.
I dont want to wake up. Lol
Plot twist: the random guy walking is actually on acid and this is normal too him 😝
"Your under my genjutsu right now "
Wait till they do it do a mentally ill person that's when the real show starts
I'd freak outtt
Trash
That's evil
He didn't hear them.... Ear buds were in...smh
*The same night-* **Him standing at the edge of his balcony** "Here it goes!"
Imagine being high and experience this, I would be dead.
You should have somthing happen right after that seems like dream material
All fun and games until he kills himself Inception style.
I know this shit is most likely fake for a random YouTube channel but this ‘prank’ is something known as gaslighting and is something that can cause serious mental issues and trauma in some people especially over long periods of time. It can also be super illegal and you can get fined and if done at a huge extent possible jail time.
These aren’t pranks but attempts to fuck with someone’s mind. This is becoming a very weird world we live in today
As a vivid dreamer I would be like checking my tells.
Nah this would genuinely scare me I'd be so anxious 😭
Sounds hella good but guess he didnt hear the first ones
😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😭😭😂🤣😂😭😂🤣😭😂🤣
That is pretty cringy
I would fall for it
Plot twist: he actually wakes up
And Yet Chop Suey hasn't been screamed!
He was DEFINITELY wondering!!!!! Haha
this is stupid.
He had airpods in, you cant tell me he actually heard them
When he said right now...?  😂😂😂
I don't feel like this is a good idea. It could really mess with someone if you do it to the wrong person
Back when I was addicted to meth, staying up for days at a time, this would have tripped me tf out! I’m almost 8 years clean though lol
This not funny
Y’all wild 😂
MORE PLZ this is hilarious 😂
That would suck if someone that had been in a coma went through that lol
Bro this will actually be making u think your dreaming😂
Lamb of god - Memento mori
XD
*You never fail to entertain us* 💙
Fuck off I have extreme paranoia and you were getting me for a second 🥲
Nice paid actor
Deadly Queen be like.
I'm terrified of this happening to me
If it was me i would have took it seriously, i always question myself if I'm dreaming rn, sometimes it really feels like I'm dreaming..
This is good
Other people kill themselves in dreams so they can wake up? I always hold my breath in the dream until I wake up.
https://youtube.com/shorts/ruwJ-BQtNbA?feature=share
Invisible cameraman
Me who has been practicing lucid dreams for 4 years: Pathetic.
Fake Oscar's nomination.
Inception
Idk why i got full body chills after watching this
existential crisis
What if he did wake up and ended the simulation.
Loooool hahahahhaa 😂
It's not convincing, wake him up at least every 1 hour
5 more minutes 😪
Get 10 people that are strangers and do this to one person through out the day
His ass was pranked way too many times ,he just didn't bought it
I'm scraping rock bottom and you telling me to wake up?
"none of this is real you're lucid dreaming and theirs a fire"
Nope that would probably be it for me. I'm folding.
good way to cause an existential crisis
Sup with all that Chinese sex stuff? Somebody click one of those links for me and lemme know what it is
The guy had seen the camera better you stop.
Please dont do this prank on people. If you do it hard enough you could really end up throwing somebody off the deep end
What a mind fuck
Dude am throwing hands
Please never do this to someone with extreme anxiety it can seriously cause someone bad and make them think there actually dreaming
Waking Life
Imagine if they did this to a person who was on acid
Average schizo prank enjoyer
Bad prank
What if he pulled out a gun and shot himself to wake up? Nah, maybe I'm just dreaming.
New alarm sound
I am literally rofl 🤣🤣🤣
BWAAAHAH 😂 He had earpods in so he DIDN'T hear a thing the first time around!!!🤦🤦🤦🤣🤣🤣
yeah don't do that...
Connor going to the cyberlife building
Intentional Voicecracks loved it
““No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:24‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
As a diagnosed schizophrenic this is my reality.
I think y’all need better ideas for this type of videos they are so fake
Good thing he wasn’t on shrooms this could put you in a bad trip
I'm not gonna lie if this happened to me id go into a manic episode
He saw the camera.
I get it brill vid  But depending on the person it could be v dangerous
Gaslighting at its finest
I’m watching this tripping bales on 2cb
Kinda messed up
The Matrix 5
Ik its a prank bur sometimes pranks could leave longasting effects, please don't try this, it could do some messed up stuff to ur brain like psychosis
He has in headphones. Try it on someone else. This guy can’t even hear you
Hopeful he dont commit suicide trying to wake up😂
That would freak me out fr
He has headphones in
wtf, don’t do that shit, some people deal with derealization. if someone did that to me i’d punch them ,,,
The kid is laughing thinking to himself " how dumb do these low IQ youtubers think I am"
Gaslight Inception
Listen to this and then imagine this was a message to you...
As a girl who watched this at 3am, She thought that she was dreaming
I heard that guy killed 12 people and had multiple charges of sexual assault after this video was shot
😂😂😂
Imagine this guy WAS actually in a coma and when he wakes up we all fade away into nothing
Am I tripping or do they say wake up the same like it’s edited in?
Best prank ever
This makes me wanna press the red atombomb button smh
I would freak TF OUT!!!!! Probably call 911 asap, and they'd send me to an institution instantly.
Just destroyed this guys way of thinking
Stop messing with people like that
@
This is a good prank and way to close to an acid trip gone wrong! Speaking of I dremt of one last night.
He was staring dead at the camera 😂
Don't be playing mind games,  that's not funny.
Then The guy runs infront of a speeding car because he thinks he's dreaming lol
Imagine someone comes to you on a Monday morning early and tells you wake up you are in a coma I will believe him right away lol 🤣🤣😂
That's so creepy!!!! I'd be rethinking life!!
Parallel world!
I asked people in my dream ,”you know you’re in a dream right” and they acted like I never said anything lol. Lucid dreaming is dope asf
Bruh if I was high 😂 I'd be trippin
Boys!! You re amazing!! We like this tip of content Keep going! Big respect from romania
This is inception type ish.
You gotta do this to someone who just smoked a fat joint and is ripped!   He will trip balls!!
Imagine not saying "its a prank" at the end and leaving them to think about it
i enjoyed this video but it could be dangerous if this was done to the wrong person
As someone who has a dissociative disorder, this would trigger a full blown derealization attack. I hope i never get pranked like this because just watching this video fucked up my brain.
This is messed up
Ngl bro I’d be shitting myself
Plot Twist: The coma comment was the only thing he actually heard cuz he has airpods in.
Imagine he has just finished Demon Slayer Mugen Train last night.
If i were him i wouldve commited suicide and technically its not my fault
Funny but also dangerous to convince someone there sleeping
Ask him to try slapping
⭐
😂😂😂
My biggest fear bruh
Man : what a great day!  Agents : Let's do this boys  Cameramen : sh!t, gotta need more potions for this!
Fast speeding is cheating
Mission failed we'll get him next time
Bro if someone did that to me after a blunt I would freak the f*** out
This is the typa shit that would make me have an episode fr
i get fricked out easily by this
Last guy looks like the son of sunny deol
Next time dont prank the guy with airpods in...
Connor and Markus in dbh be like
I can tell that I'm not dreaming, but I cant tell when I am dreaming. Sounds weird right?
Fun fact is, some people can actually lose their sense for perception of Reality if this prank is done on a large scale with somebody...
Ahhaahhahahahahahahaha so heavy
Great idea
Oh dang that would mess me up for sure.....
lmao
Nice invisible again
Pranks where you give someone schizophrenia and they kill themselves
After many sleepless nights thinking of that moment the young man proceeded to jump from an high building thinking that would finally wake him up.
Tcieh
now he's questioning his whole life
😑
aren't we all ? 🥺🥺🥺
If I was the guy: *instant anxiety attack*
Maybe this is a message to me or someone else and the rest of everyone is a figment of a dream
This is actually hilarious
I'm begging youuuu 😭
He can’t hear sheet
😂
Ahh. The camera man is once again... invisible to us mortals
He didn't hear the first 4 times because he has earpieces
Hope he comes out of it ok
If the guy is anything like me(mentally unstable), you've just given him a huge existencial crisis and sent him into a spiral of self destructive thoughts that he'll probably never get out of. You've either sent him straight to the mental health hospital or to his own death. How fun huh?
This is insane
Video makers, get a life 🤦🏽‍♂️
Camera guy was invisible 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good way to tell if your dreaming is counting your fingers , if there's too many your dreaming. If it's exactly 10 your alive
This is creepy actually
Ok these are the types of pranks I’ve been waiting for all my life .
Not gonna work for someone who knows the difference between reality and a dream.
Dudes just chilling listening to music and didn't notice
Everise
You guys are giving him a migraine
✨🌠Dreamcore🌠✨
this is a really cool prank!! I wanna see more and I want it to happen to me lol
Your in the matrix dude. Wake up.
You've ruined his whole life😂
That crack head high af
Them:  Wake up. Me:  Hell nah!  I'm actually getting some sleep for once.  Shut the light off on your way out.
Tried a similar prank with some friends...the victim is now suffering from psychosis and what not. Not know whats real or whats fake....
I want to wake up.
Yoo, thats palm walk ASU
You can see the camera guy easily so he looked directly at him least mean it less obvious
All videos like this should be filmed at ASU
Bro this shit is honestly scary asf
It’s weird. When I’m dreaming I’m not aware that I’m dreaming. But when I’m awake, I KNOW that I’m awake
Plot twist: they are all friends trying to get cheap views on YouTube shorts.
Its all fun until he actually unlocked some power shit
I remember this episode of Futurama
Stop this ! It's not funny 😐
I’m such a paranoid person I would believe him 🤣
Can you just give shorts their own page already. People that like them and hate them will both be happy.
I feel this one was done poorly, cause there’s a brick building on the other side of the trees, and you can tell he just moved behind them and runs back in front of him. You can see the dude look over out of sight, probably at the guy running back in front of him.  Clearly I know that’s the point, but this one wasn’t done very well.
wake up
Bruh proly didn't hear them cz of his earphones
Do it to someone walking out of a weed store 😂😂😂
Have everyone wear a suit and tie and at the end all walk towards him and say wake up altogether
That dude is gonna pull an Inception and kill himself to "wake up"
I would be scared half to death no 🧢
😂👍 , i feel that he started to believe
He questioned his existence for a sec
He knew he wasn't dreaming cuz he had his phone
Do this to the wrong schizophrenic and ya might get killed
---->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R --->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSlhjwzn3utvcw6XKujKjb0C
This a good way to make someone doubt their entire life
That man is now tripping 😂 like wtf is going on
Great idea. The acting not so much. Could've really tripped his circut breaker but the last guy gave it away via eye-contact.
He looks like a scared mouse  stuck in a sticky trap
Either he's very intelligent or too stupid to believe 😂
«Hey man we need you to wake up»  -What?  «You’re dreaming right now» *Me* -Well guess imma start by stealing this car.
Something cool watched today 😍😍
My depersonalisation and derealisation couldn’t handle this shit😂
🤣🤣🤣
Please don't do this to me. I'm way to paranoid for this 😭
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
You had me until the, part that wasn't cool
He had airpods he didn't heard the firsts.
Bro gonna do this to a schizo and make him go on a rampage
Bro that was me on acid, thought i was in a coma and tried to wake myself up by almost jumping out a window, luckily my friends stopped me fml
“Ur in a coma” 💀💀💀 im fuckin deadddd
Imagine being a newbie high off weed and this happens. This would b the perfect opportunity for a paranoid trip lol
That would cause ya anxiety ahaha
No wonder it didn't work. He could see them walk back every time🤣😂
Shouldn't mess with people like that
How would you know
Definitely the sound clip of metro 2033 when artyom climbs the radio tower
It’s even cooler because someone actually suggested these a while ago.
It's me with head phones lol
How'd he hear them through his airpods?
I drink n take that many drugs I'd prolly believe these mfs 😂😂
I'm stoned all the time if they pull that shit on me I think I'd lose my shit
id freak out
He shit his pants lol
Get right with God today and repent before it is too late ❤️💕
Actually a good prank 😂
Become aware.
Maybe choose someone who's not got airpods in  😂
The reality is the waking state is a dream  just like the dream state but we mistaken it for real life this is a fact to the enlighten being
,,For the record: I am not a Bible scholar, and have no formal training in any way. In fact, I am a High School dropout and have never taken a college course or any theology classes. I’ve never read a ‘Commentary’ on any Scripture, I can’t read Hebrew, Greek or any language other than English.  I say all that to say this: If you glean anything from what I'm about to say you need to know it is from the Living God. Not me. The confidence I have in His word comes from Him. The faith that I have in His ability to transform and redeem lives comes from Him and from personal experience.
This is kinda messed up.
Despierta
It’s all fun and game until you end up actually fucking up someone’s mental health
That’s fucked
This will have devastating effects on my mental health
I have so many dreams where I realize I’m dreaming and I’d trash my workplace, then my boss will get pissed and fire me and I’d think it’s real life again, shits fucky but this reminded me of that for some reason
Now this is a prank 😂😂😂
That's why it's reco to go to bed by time and sleep well.😁
imagine arranging beforehand with a relative of the boy to record an audio with the voice of the relative telling him to wake up, and at the end play the audio very loud, if it were me I would really think I was in a coma
Not funny...
Dont fuck with people like that then they think their dreaming and do something stupid
That was fucking stupid.
He heard nothing the whole time. He thought people were just nodding to him
She asked me can you a pass a drug test I told her not since 96'
This is very bad. If I was the guy walking down I would freak out and kill myself.
THATS NOT FUNNY
I would stop and laugh at the first one🤦🏿‍♀️
Would be better if they were walking down the sidewalk already and not popping out from the sides.
This is trending how ?
Top 10 of the Funniest One Liners!  1. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 2. If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made with meat? 3. No one is listening until you make a mistake. 4. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word? 5. Campers: Nature's way of feeding mosquitoes.  6. I started out with nothing and I still have most of it. 7. You can't have everything; where would you put it? 8. I took an IQ test and the results were negative. 9. Okay, who stopped the payment on my reality check?  10. We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse.   Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
But mental health is important lol. It’s be fine to say u r dreamin but a fuckin coma? That’s in bad taste. I remember when my brother was in a coma and I begged him to wake up. Very funny shit
Imagine you high asf and this happens.. I would trip tf out
This could push some brains across the snapping line.
This is pretty evil. There are people Out there with physiological problems that wouldn't take this very well.
Taking the piss with being in a coma when there are people who are actually in one fighting for their life.
You want to freak these guys out in Revenge? Just look at them and smile and say, "No way!  I'm not waking up.  I just killed three people!  Best day of my life!!!".
Anti-cringe pill 💊 yw.
He probably not sleeping Tonight
2nd twin sounded like shaggy
That sh!t can get to some 😅
this isn't funny tho Lol
What total mindfucking jerks to do this.
Would of spooked him from the beginning, but he had his buds in , so all he saw was people mouthing weirdo to him , 😜
Maybe we all do need to wake the hell up
The way he looked around as if he might actually been dreaming
Ok now I think I’m in a coma and this is just all a dream?!?! 😭😵‍💫
Zzzz
Y'all need to find someone who just smoked and do this lol
Haha Damm this skitt is lit 🔥 😆
man had enough
Thats so awkward 😂
Naw man people who suffer with hallucinations and psychosis had to deal with this on a daily basis, you dont gotta add a mockery to that
Tje amount of movies and tv shows that I've watched, I'll probably believe it 🥲
Dude has headphones on
is not wake up.. but is  GET A JOB!
🤔They better not do that to me! Because I'd probably go grab the hottest woman I could find and kiss her in the mouth thinking it was just dreaming,. so why not.. LOL, 🤣🤣
This is crazy
a
Lmaooo please keep making these videos they are freaking hilarious
Smh this guy is gon be traumatized
Dude didn't notice a single one til the last...🤣🤣🤣
:)
That's kinda fucked up
These videos are so crap!
Im in coma too 😂😂🤣
Not a prank 🥲
This is a potential mindfuck for some poor bastard.
Yeah he's not buying it
Until they prank someone with extreme anxiety disorder*
Lololol
Enga adi velunu theriyaththu da fk u.......😇
Fk
Lol.
Bruh I've had to many bad trips if this shit happened to they'd have to put me in a padded room
That would scare the hell out of me
No cap we used to do this to our friends that used to get super stoned at our sessions, we all gather around them and talk about how long they'd been in a coma  for and that all your friends are here in your coma dream because we're surrounded your bed waiting for you to wake up.
“If I’m dreaming I can jump off this bridge”
This is such a stupid prank lmao
Wake up? That's a waste of weed. Let him enjoy the coma.
You guys need to appear from left to right alternating.
These "shorts are entertaining💛" comments are so disgusting that they always do my days worse.
Holy shit i would question my existence 🤣🤣🤣
A coma sounds nice right now.
Yes Attempt To Send Someone Into A *Psychotic Break* Then Cry *Victim* When The Rage Is Directed At You
This is why I dont trip in public
That’s terrifying
He would trip out if the same person came out all the times
I'm not dreaming, I'm dying
This can actually traumatized someone.
Imagine having the best high you’ve had and this absolutely kills it for you 😂😂
This isn't funny.
This would really fuck w me cause I have brain damage and I would probably believe it. My dreams are very very real and I’ve also been in a permanent trip. So things tend to get distorted for me even when it’s reality
This is what a prank should be like.
Wohh 🤣 😳
The lost Franco brother has been found
I would just cry after a while, cause what.
Dommage ses écouteurs gâche l'idée j'aimerai voir ça avec quelqu'un non distrait
this is fu**** annoying stop doing this
Should have done this to a spiritual Karen😂😂
Bro ain’t falling for it lol
I'd definitely think I was in a coma if a guy sounding like Winnie the Pooh told me to please wake up like that.
This is dumb
Maybe do this prank to someone not wearing headphones. I prob didn’t hear you the first few times.
Lol
Can you do that with every one is a person from the future like from young to old
hire 100+ people and do this  and you will see someone in massive anxiety strike lol
Crap stick to the other ones you do
Wake up          GRAB A BRUSH AND DO A LITTLE MAKE UP!!!
Please wake up 🙏🙏
Where is the part I’m supposed to laugh?
999x Random people: Wake Up~ The man: ✨*Ascended*✨
That would trip me the fuk out
This is messed up lol
I will pay you handsomely to do this to my friends…..
Some of these days these people are gonna get so paranoid
His face whas priceless
Too ambiguous for a prank to perform on an adult. I mean it'll still trip them tf out, but ud get a better reaction from someone younger. Someone who is still very creative and imaginative
Trauma Inducing 😂😂😂
He probably didn’t hear the first ones
PUT ON A LITTLE MAKE UP!
Is this real. It's been happening to me lately. Just in a different way. And they call it skitzophrenic. Please someone wake me up. If anyone can hear me, I hear you. But I can't remember anything!
If they trolled me like this, I would've probably went to the nearest building to do a head dive and pop some dark angel wings.
Now he’s gonna have psychological problems and need a therapist because he doesn’t think anything is real
The guy walking: "Oh... Déjà vu"  Trinity, out of nowhere: "What did you just say ?!"  Morpheus: "It happens as a glitch when they change the system, the agents are coming"
2018 is still going on huh
How is this guy going to explain what happened to him to someone else
JESUS LOVES YOU SO SO MUCH!NEVER FORGET THAT!! HE DIED ON THE CROSS FOR YOU! TRUST IN HIM AND REPENT TODAY TO BE SAVED!! ✝️💜❤️❤️
I do this to my daughter randomly some days.  I give her the same morning speech I normally do with all the same inflections. She just thinks I'm freakin weird. Lol
An idea: Do the “please wake up” dream, but do both sets of twins one after the year, and everybody wears black suits and shades like the Matrix!
Cameraman is John Xena
Make it more believable like instead of keep saying please wake up and speak slower
🤣
Imagine an edible kicking in at this exact moment
Imagin every Person that u See will say this to u 😂
Nah don’t I have a paranoid mindset at times iv beeñ in a comer for 10 years
What if we are all asleep and need to wake up
Please do not do this
I like how for a moment he's like "bro please not this, not right now"
😂😂😂👏
“He has AirPods in he can’t hear us!”
That dude thought he was trippin out
I like these videos but the coma comment was really asinine.
Did they not notice the airpods?
😂
What would be a great prank is too start freaking out, and admit  you knew you are dreaming, and now you have proof. Threaten him to tell you how he knows...maybe.
God loves you and sent his son Jesus for you
He was jammin' thinking about a girl he's into. #fail
https://youtube.com/channel/UCAW55nFJevuzPg3F0SGGs_w
Nahhh this would have me freaked out
‘You’re dreaming.. please wake up’   Me: right now?   ‘Yeah’   *pulls out AR15*
Imagine if he just started panicing and started hitting himself in the head just to realise it was a prank💀
Pretty crazy
Dude he's on airpods he ain't hearing shit😂
Bruh smiled the whole way 😆
Just hope this guy has not watched Mugen Train
He is wearing airpods
Imagine one day, the target say  "I try it men, everyday" Then crying
Simply awesome!! Big like 👊😎
I love this!!!
He went teehe
Dude couldn't hear anything with his airpods in.
I be like am I really here or sleeping panic mode comes in 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
The guy wasn’t falling for it
wait cup
Bro this would mess me up bad
Wake up!
😂🤯
Kid was thinking about it 😂😂
Next the guy kill’s himself because que thinks he’s asleep
Used to do this to my cousin when we were kids, after we would smoke weed. He'd cry and all that😂😂😂 I'm an asshole😂
💯
😂😂💀
Hahaha bros you should do this again. But you guys keep going round, do it like 10 times to really trip the guy out. In the drive thru it would be interesting too. Send the cars round and round.
